    "preamble": "\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900) was a German philosopher of the\nlate 19th century who challenged the foundations of Christianity and\ntraditional morality. He was interested in the enhancement of\nindividual and cultural health, and believed in life, creativity,\npower, and down-to-earth realities, rather than those situated in a\nworld beyond. Central to his philosophy is the idea of\n\u201clife-affirmation,\u201d which involves an honest questioning\nof all doctrines that drain life\u2019s expansive energies, however\nsocially prevalent and morally entrenched those views might be. Often\nreferred to as one of the first existentialist philosophers along with\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855), Nietzsche\u2019s\nrevitalizing philosophy has inspired leading figures in all walks of\ncultural life, including dancers, poets, novelists, painters,\npsychologists, philosophers, sociologists and social\nrevolutionaries.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life: 1844\u20131900\n\nIn the small German village of R\u00f6cken bei L\u00fctzen, located in\na rural farmland area about 20 miles southwest of Leipzig, Friedrich\nWilhelm Nietzsche was born at approximately 10:00 a.m. on October 15,\n1844. The date coincided with the 49th birthday of the Prussian King,\nFriedrich Wilhelm IV, after whom Nietzsche was named, and who had been\nresponsible for Nietzsche\u2019s father\u2019s appointment as\nR\u00f6cken\u2019s town pastor.\n\nNietzsche\u2019s uncle and grandfathers were also Lutheran ministers,\nand his paternal grandfather, Friedrich August Ludwig Nietzsche\n(1756\u20131826), was further distinguished as a Protestant scholar,\none of whose books (1796) affirmed the \u201ceverlasting survival of\nChristianity.\u201d Nietzsche\u2019s grandparents on both sides were\nfrom the Province of Saxony, with his paternal grandfather, paternal\ngrandmother (Erdmuthe Dorothea Krause, 1778\u20131856), maternal\ngrandfather (David Ernst Ohler, 1787\u20131859) and maternal\ngrandmother (Johanna Elisabeth Wilhelmine Hahn, 1794\u20131876)\nhaving been born respectively in the small towns of Bibra (just south\nof Jena), Reichenbach (southeast of Jena), Zeitz (between Jena and\nLeipzig), and Wehlitz (just northwest of Leipzig).\n\nWhen Nietzsche was nearly 5 years old, his father, Karl Ludwig\nNietzsche (1813\u20131849) died from a brain ailment (July 30, 1849)\nand the death of Nietzsche\u2019s two-year-old brother, Ludwig\nJoseph, followed traumatically six months later (January 4, 1850).\nHaving been living only yards away from R\u00f6cken\u2019s church in\nthe house reserved for the pastor and his family, the Nietzsche family\nleft their home soon after Karl Ludwig\u2019s death. They moved to\nnearby Naumburg an der Saale, where Nietzsche (called\n\u201cFritz\u201d by his family) lived with his mother, Franziska\n(1826\u20131897), his grandmother, Erdmuthe, his father\u2019s two\nsisters, Auguste and Rosalie (d. 1855 and 1867, respectively), and his\nyounger sister, Therese Elisabeth Alexandra (1846\u20131935).\n\nFrom the ages of 14 to 19 (1858\u20131864), Nietzsche attended a\nfirst-rate boarding school, Schulpforta, located about 4km from his\nhome in Naumburg, where he prepared for university studies. The\nschool\u2019s rigid educational atmosphere was reflected in its long\nhistory as a former Cistercian monastery (1137\u20131540), with\nbuildings that included a 12th century Romanesque chapel and a 13th\ncentury Gothic church. At Schulpforta\u2014a school whose alumni\nincluded the German Idealist philosopher, Johann Gottlieb Fichte\n(1762\u20131814) and the philologist, Ulrich von\nWilamowitz-M\u00f6llendorff (1848\u20131931)\u2014Nietzsche met his\nlifelong friend, Paul Deussen (1845\u20131919), who was confirmed at\nNietzsche\u2019s side in 1861, and who was to become an Orientalist,\nhistorian of philosophy, and in 1911, the founder of the Schopenhauer\nSociety. During his summers in Naumburg, Nietzsche led a small music\nand literature club named \u201cGermania,\u201d and became\nacquainted with Richard Wagner\u2019s music through the club\u2019s\nsubscription to the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik. The teenage\nNietzsche also read the German romantic writings of Friedrich\nH\u00f6lderlin and Jean-Paul Richter, along with David Strauss\u2019s\ncontroversial and demythologizing Life of Jesus Critically\nExamined (Das Leben Jesu kritisch bearbeitet, 1848).\n\nAfter graduating from Schulpforta, Nietzsche entered the University of\nBonn in 1864 as a theology and philology student, and his interests\nsoon gravitated more exclusively towards philology\u2014a discipline\nwhich then centered upon the interpretation of classical and biblical\ntexts. As a student of philology, Nietzsche attended lectures by Otto\nJahn (1813\u20131869) and Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl\n(1806\u20131876). Jahn was a biographer of Mozart who had studied at\nthe University of Berlin under Karl Lachmann (1793\u20131851)\u2014a\nphilologist known both for his studies of the Roman philosopher,\nLucretius (ca. 99\u201355 BCE), and for having developed the\ngenealogical, or stemmatic, method in textual recension; Ritschl was a\nclassics scholar whose work centered on the Roman comic poet, Plautus\n(254\u2013184 BCE).\n\nInspired by Ritschl, and following him to the University of Leipzig in\n1865\u2014an institution located closer to Nietzsche\u2019s hometown\nof Naumburg\u2014Nietzsche quickly established his own academic\nreputation through his published essays on two 6th century BCE poets,\nTheognis and Simonides, as well as on Aristotle. In Leipzig, he\ndeveloped a close friendship with Erwin Rohde (1845\u20131898), a\nfellow philology student and future philologist, with whom he would\ncorrespond extensively in later years. Momentous for Nietzsche in 1865\nwas his accidental discovery of Arthur Schopenhauer\u2019s The\nWorld as Will and Representation (1818) in a local bookstore. He\nwas then 21. Schopenhauer\u2019s atheistic and turbulent vision of\nthe world, in conjunction with his high praise of music as an art form\ncaptured Nietzsche\u2019s imagination, and to this day, the extent to\nwhich the \u201ccadaverous perfume\u201d of Schopenhauer\u2019s\nworld-view continued to permeate Nietzsche\u2019s mature thought\nremains a matter of scholarly debate. After discovering Schopenhauer,\nNietzsche read F.A. Lange\u2019s newly-published History of\nMaterialism and Critique of its Present Significance\n(1866)\u2014a work that criticizes materialist theories from the\nstandpoint of Kant\u2019s critique of metaphysics, and that attracted\nNietzsche\u2019s interest for its view that metaphysical speculation\nis an expression of poetic illusion.\n\nIn 1867, as he approached the age of 23, Nietzsche entered his\nrequired military service and was assigned to an equestrian field\nartillery regiment close to Naumburg, during which time he lived at\nhome with his mother. While attempting to leap-mount into the saddle,\nhe suffered a serious chest injury and was put on sick leave after his\nchest wound refused to heal. He returned shortly thereafter to the\nUniversity of Leipzig, and in November of 1868, met the composer\nRichard Wagner (1813\u20131883) at the home of Hermann Brockhaus\n(1806\u20131877), an Orientalist who was married to Wagner\u2019s\nsister, Ottilie. Brockhaus was himself a specialist in Sanskrit and\nPersian whose publications included (1850) an edition of the\nVendidad Sade\u2014a text of the Zoroastrian religion, whose\nprophet was Zarathustra (Zoroaster).\n\nWagner and Nietzsche shared an enthusiasm for Schopenhauer, and\nNietzsche\u2014who had been composing piano, choral and orchestral\nmusic since he was a teenager\u2014admired Wagner for his musical\ngenius, magnetic personality and cultural influence. Wagner was the\nsame age Nietzsche\u2019s father would have been, and he had also\nattended the University of Leipzig many years before. The\nNietzsche-Wagner relationship was quasi-familial and sometimes-stormy,\nand it affected Nietzsche deeply. Early on, he could write (in 1869)\nthat his friendship with Wagner was the \u201cgreatest\nachievement\u201d [die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Errungenschaft] of\nhis life, and he was still energetically engaged in appraising and\npondering Wagner\u2019s cultural significance twenty years later at\nthe end of his writing life. But Nietzsche broke with Wagner\npersonally and intellectually in the late 1870s, and his assessments\nbecame increasingly negative (and more and more explicit) as time went\non. Nevertheless, even after their break, Nietzsche was still\nreminiscing wistfully in 1882 about how his days with Wagner had been\nthe best of his life. During the months surrounding Nietzsche\u2019s\ninitial meeting with Wagner, Ritschl recommended Nietzsche for a\nposition on the classical philology faculty at the University of\nBasel. The Swiss university offered Nietzsche the professorial\nposition, and he began teaching there in May, 1869, at the age of 24.\n\n\nAt Basel, Nietzsche\u2019s satisfaction with his life among his\nphilology colleagues was limited, and he established closer\nintellectual ties to the historians Franz Overbeck (1837\u20131905)\nand Jacob Burkhardt (1818\u20131897), whose lectures he attended.\nOverbeck\u2014who roomed for five years in the same house as\nNietzsche\u2014became Nietzsche\u2019s close and enduring friend,\nexchanging many letters with him over the years, and rushing to\nNietzsche\u2019s assistance in Turin immediately after his\ndevastating collapse in 1889. Nietzsche also cultivated his friendship\nwith Richard Wagner and visited him often at his Swiss home in\nTribschen, a small town near Lucerne. Never in outstanding health,\nfurther complications arose from Nietzsche\u2019s August-October 1870\nservice as a 25-year-old hospital attendant during the Franco-Prussian\nWar (1870\u201371), where he participated in the siege of Metz. He\nwitnessed the traumatic effects of battle, took close care of wounded\nsoldiers, and contracted diphtheria and dysentery.\n\nNietzsche\u2019s enthusiasm for Schopenhauer, his studies in\nclassical philology, his inspiration from Wagner, his reading of\nLange, his interests in health, his professional need to prove himself\nas a young academic, and his frustration with the contemporary German\nculture, all coalesced in his first book\u2014The Birth of\nTragedy (1872)\u2014which was published in January 1872 when\nNietzsche was 27. Wagner showered the book with praise, but a\nvitriolic, painfully-memorable and yet authoritative critical reaction\nby Ulrich von Wilamowitz-M\u00f6llendorff\u2014who later became one\nof Germany\u2019s leading philologists\u2014immediately dampened the\nbook\u2019s reception, not to mention Nietzsche\u2019s class\nenrollments in Basel.\n\nWilamowitz-M\u00f6llendorff came from an aristocratic family of\ndistant Polish descent and knew Nietzsche as a student at Schulpforta.\nIn his critique, he referred to Nietzsche as a disgrace to\nSchulpforta, and said that in light of the latter\u2019s prophetic,\nsoothsaying, exaggerated and historically uninformed style of writing,\nNietzsche should instead \u201cgather tigers and panthers about his\nknees, but not the youth of Germany.\u201d It is intriguing that in\nThus Spoke Zarathustra, written thirteen years later,\nNietzsche invokes the comparable imagery of a lion nuzzling warmly at\nthe knees of Zarathustra in the book\u2019s concluding and\ninspirational scene, as if to acknowledge that his proper audience is,\nindeed, not a set of university professors.\n\nAs Nietzsche continued his residence in Switzerland between 1872 and\n1879, he often visited Wagner at his new (1872) home in Bayreuth,\nGermany. In 1873, he met Paul R\u00e9e (1849\u20131901), who, while\nliving in close company with Nietzsche in Sorrento during the autumn\nof 1876, would write On the Origin of Moral Feelings (1877).\nDuring this time, Nietzsche completed a series of four studies on\ncontemporary German culture\u2014the Unfashionable\nObservations (1873\u201376)\u2014which focus respectively upon\n(1) the historian of religion and culture critic, David Strauss, (2)\nissues concerning the social value of historiography, (3) Arthur\nSchopenhauer and (4) Richard Wagner, both as heroic inspirations for\nnew cultural standards.\n\nNear the end of his university career, Nietzsche completed Human,\nAll-Too-Human (1878)\u2014a book that marks a turning point in\nhis philosophical style and that, while reinforcing his friendship\nwith R\u00e9e, also ends his friendship with the anti-Semitic\nWagner, who comes under attack in a thinly-disguised characterization\nof \u201cthe artist.\u201d Despite the damage done by the\nunflattering review of The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche\nremained respected in his professorial position in Basel, but his\ndeteriorating health, which led to migraine headaches, eyesight\nproblems and vomiting, necessitated his resignation from the\nuniversity in June, 1879, at age 34. At this point, he had been a\nuniversity professor for ten years, and had just less than another ten\nyears of productive intellectual life remaining.\n\nFrom 1880 until his collapse in January 1889, Nietzsche led a\nwandering, Roma-like existence as a stateless person (having given up\nhis German citizenship, and not having acquired Swiss citizenship),\ncircling almost annually between his mother\u2019s house in Naumburg\nand various French, Swiss, German and Italian cities. His travels took\nhim through the Mediterranean seaside city of Nice (during the\nwinters), the Swiss alpine village of Sils-Maria (during the summers,\nlocated near the present-day ski resort of St. Moritz), Leipzig (where\nhe had attended university, and had been hoping to resume his teaching\ncareer in 1883), Turin, Genoa, Recoaro, Messina, Rapallo, Florence,\nVenice, and Rome, never residing in any place longer than several\nmonths at a time.\n\nOn a visit to Rome in 1882, Nietzsche, now at age thirty-seven, met\nLou von Salom\u00e9 (1861\u20131937), a 21 year old Russian woman\nwho was studying philosophy and theology in Zurich. They had an active\nintellectual relationship and Nietzsche appears to have fallen in love\nwith her. Their relationship did not develop on a romantic level, and\ntheir friendship took a turn for the worse when Salom\u00e9 and Paul\nR\u00e9e left Nietzsche and moved to Berlin. In the years to follow,\nSalom\u00e9 would write a book about Nietzsche (Friedrich\nNietzsche in seinen Werken [Friedrich Nietzsche in his Works]) in\n1894, and would later become an associate of Sigmund Freud, who she\nmet in 1911. Salom\u00e9\u2019s insightful book on Nietzsche is one\nof the first to propose the division of Nietzsche\u2019s writings\ninto early, middle, and late periods.\n\nThese nomadic years were the occasion of Nietzsche\u2019s main works,\namong which are Daybreak (1881), The Gay Science\n(1882/1887), Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883\u201385),\nBeyond Good and Evil (1886), and On the Genealogy of\nMorals (1887). Nietzsche\u2019s final active year, 1888, saw the\ncompletion of The Case of Wagner (May-August 1888),\nTwilight of the Idols (August-September 1888), The\nAntichrist (September 1888), Ecce Homo (October-November\n1888) and Nietzsche Contra Wagner (December 1888).\n\nOn the morning of January 3, 1889, while in Turin, Nietzsche\nexperienced a mental breakdown which left him an invalid for the rest\nof his life. Coincidentally, on virtually the same date, viz., January\n4, his little brother, Joseph, had died many years before. Nietzsche,\nupon witnessing a horse being whipped by a coachman at the Piazza\nCarlo Alberto\u2014although this episode with the horse could be\nanecdotal\u2014threw his arms around the horse\u2019s neck and\ncollapsed in the plaza, never to return to full sanity.\n\nSome argue that Nietzsche was afflicted with a syphilitic infection\n(this was the original diagnosis of the doctors in Basel and Jena)\ncontracted either while he was a student or while he was serving as a\nhospital attendant during the Franco-Prussian War; some claim that his\nuse of chloral hydrate, a drug which he had been using as a sedative,\nundermined his already-weakened nervous system; some speculate that\nNietzsche\u2019s collapse was due to a brain disease he inherited\nfrom his father; some maintain that a mental illness gradually drove\nhim insane; some maintain that he suffered from a slow-growing,\nfrontal cranial base tumor; some maintain that he suffered from\nCADASIL syndrome, a hereditary stroke disorder; some maintain that\nNietzsche suffered from a tumor on the surface of the brain growing\nbehind his right eye. The exact cause of Nietzsche\u2019s\nincapacitation remains unclear. That he had an extraordinarily\nsensitive nervous constitution and took an assortment of medications\nis well-documented as a more general fact. To complicate matters of\ninterpretation, Nietzsche states in a letter from April 1888 that he\nnever had any symptoms of a mental disorder.\n\nDuring his creative years, Nietzsche struggled to bring his writings\ninto print and never doubted that his books would have a lasting\ncultural effect. He did not live long enough to experience his\nworld-historical influence, but he had a brief glimpse of his growing\nintellectual importance in discovering that he was the subject of 1888\nlectures given by Georg Brandes (Georg Morris Cohen) at the University\nof Copenhagen, to whom he directed the above April 1888\ncorrespondence, and from whom he received a recommendation to read\nKierkegaard\u2019s works. Nietzsche\u2019s collapse, however,\nfollowed soon thereafter.\n\nAfter a brief hospitalization in Basel, he spent 1889 in a sanatorium\nin Jena at the Binswanger Clinic, and in March 1890 his mother took\nhim back home to Naumburg, where he lived under her care for the next\nseven years in the house he knew as a youngster. After his\nmother\u2019s death in 1897, his sister Elisabeth\u2014having\nreturned home from Paraguay in 1893, where she had been working since\n1886 with her husband Bernhard F\u00f6rster to establish an Aryan,\nanti-Semitic German colony called \u201cNew Germany\u201d\n(\u201cNueva Germania\u201d)\u2014assumed responsibility for\nNietzsche\u2019s welfare. In an effort to promote her brother\u2019s\nphilosophy, she rented the \u201cVilla Silberblick,\u201d a large\nhouse in Weimar, and moved both Nietzsche and his collected\nmanuscripts to the residence. This became the new home of the\nNietzsche Archives (which had been located at the family home for the\nthree years preceding), where Elisabeth received visitors who wanted\nto observe the now-incapacitated philosopher.\n\nOn August 25, 1900, Nietzsche died in the villa as he approached his\n56th year, apparently of pneumonia in combination with a stroke. His\nbody was then transported to the family gravesite directly beside the\nchurch in R\u00f6cken bei L\u00fctzen, where his mother and sister now\nalso rest. The Villa Silberblick was eventually turned into a museum,\nand since 1950, Nietzsche\u2019s manuscripts have been located in\nWeimar at the Goethe- und Schiller-Archiv\n2. Early Writings: 1872\u20131876\n\nNietzsche\u2019s first book was published in 1872 and was entitled\nThe Birth of Tragedy, Out of the Spirit of Music (Die\nGeburt der Trag\u00f6die aus dem Geiste der Musik). Overall, it\nsets forth a more visceral and existential alternative to the late\n18th/early 19th century understanding of Greek culture\u2014an\nunderstanding largely inspired by Johann Winckelmann\u2019s\nHistory of Ancient Art (1764)\u2014which, grounded on the\naesthetics of classical sculpture, hailed ancient Greece as the\nepitome of noble simplicity, calm grandeur, clear blue skies, and\nrational serenity. In 1886, Nietzsche\u2019s book was reissued with a\nrevised title, The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and\nPessimism (Die Geburt der Trag\u00f6die, Oder: Griechentum\nund Pessimismus), along with a lucid and revealing prefatory\nessay\u2014\u201cAn Attempt at Self-Criticism\u201d\u2014which\nexpresses Nietzsche\u2019s own critical reflections on the book,\nlooking back fourteen years. Although he remained proud of the work,\nNietzsche also describes it as questionable, strange and almost\ninaccessible, filled with Kantian and Schopenhauerian formulas that\nwere inherently at odds with the new valuations he was trying to\nexpress.\n\nHaving by this time absorbed the Schopenhauerian view that\nnon-rational forces reside at the foundation of all creativity and of\nreality itself, and that these forces are artistically best conveyed\nin music, Nietzsche identifies a strongly instinctual, wild, amoral,\n\u201cDionysian\u201d energy within pre-Socratic Greek culture as an\nessentially creative and healthy force, locating its prime expression\nin the tragic chorus, and constituting the very life of the tragedy.\nSurveying the history of Western culture since the time of the Greeks,\nNietzsche laments over how this Dionysian, creative energy had been\nsubmerged and weakened as it became overshadowed by the\n\u201cApollonian\u201d forces of logical order and stiff sobriety.\nHe concludes that European culture since the time of Socrates has\nremained one-sidedly Apollonian, repressed, scientific, and relatively\nunhealthy. Wagner expressed similar sentiments in his 1849 essay\n\u201cArt and Revolution,\u201d as he described Western society as\nhaving been on the decline since the times of the ancient Greeks. \n\nAs a means towards a cultural rebirth, Nietzsche advocates in\ncontemporary life, the resurrection and fuller release of Dionysian\nartistic energies\u2014those which he associates with primordial\ncreativity, joy in existence and ultimate truth. The seeds of this\nliberating rebirth Nietzsche perceives in the German music of his time\n(viz., Bach, Beethoven and especially Wagner), and the concluding part\nof The Birth of Tragedy, in effect, adulates the emerging\nGerman artistic, tragic spirit as the potential savior of European\nculture. As one of his early books, The Birth of Tragedy has\na strong Wagnerian and Schopenhauerian flavor, and scholars disagree\nabout the extent to which Nietzsche departs from Schopenhauer in this\nwork and in later works.\n\nSome regard Nietzsche\u2019s 1873 unpublished essay, \u201cOn Truth\nand Lies in a Nonmoral Sense\u201d (\u201c\u00dcber Wahrheit und\nL\u00fcge im au\u00dfermoralischen Sinn\u201d) as a keystone in\nhis thought; some believe that it is a peripheral, conflicted and\nnon-representative fragment in his writings. In this essay, Nietzsche\nrejects the idea of universal constants, and claims, presumably as a\ntruth, that what we call \u201ctruth\u201d is only \u201ca mobile\narmy of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms.\u201d His view at\nthis time is that arbitrariness prevails within human experience:\nconcepts originate via the transformation of nerve stimuli into\nimages, and \u201ctruth\u201d is nothing more than the invention of\nfixed conventions for practical purposes, especially those of repose,\nsecurity and consistency. Nietzsche regards our\n\u201cknowledge\u201d as human, all-too-human, mostly a matter of\nself-deception that issues from a deep-seated exercise of metaphorical\nthought. Viewing our existence from a vast and sobering distance,\nNietzsche further notes that there was an eternity before human beings\ncame into existence, and believes that after humanity dies out,\nnothing significant will have changed in the great scheme of\nthings.\n\nBetween 1873 and 1876, Nietzsche wrote the Unfashionable\nObservations (Unzeitgem\u00e4sse Betrachtungen, also\ntranslated as Untimely Meditations or Thoughts Out of\nSeason). These are four (of a projected, but never completed,\nthirteen) studies concerned with the quality of European, and\nespecially German, culture during Nietzsche\u2019s time. They are\nunfashionable and nonconformist (or \u201cuntimely,\u201d or\n\u201cunmodern,\u201d or \u201cout of place\u201d) insofar as\nNietzsche regarded his standpoint as culture-critic to be in tension\nwith the self-congratulatory spirit of the times. The four studies\nwere: David Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer (David\nStrauss, der Bekenner und der Schriftsteller, 1873); On the\nUses and Disadvantages of History for Life (Vom Nutzen und\nNachteil der Historie f\u00fcr das Leben, 1874); Schopenhauer\nas Educator (Schopenhauer als Erzieher, 1874);\nRichard Wagner in Bayreuth (1876).\n\nThe first of these attacks David Strauss, whose popular six-edition\nbook, The Old and the New Faith: A Confession (1871)\nencapsulated for Nietzsche the general cultural atmosphere in Germany.\nResponding to Strauss\u2019s advocacy of a \u201cnew faith\u201d\ngrounded upon a scientifically-determined universal\nmechanism\u2014one, however, lubricated by the optimistic,\n\u201csoothing oil\u201d of historical progress\u2014Nietzsche\ncriticizes Strauss\u2019s view as a vulgar and dismal sign of\ncultural degeneracy. Nietzsche\u2019s friend, Overbeck, in his\ncontemporaneous writings, also adopted a critical attitude towards\nStrauss. The second \u201cuntimely meditation\u201d surveys\nalternative ways to write history, and discusses how these ways could\ncontribute to a society\u2019s health. Here Nietzsche claims that the\nprinciple of \u201clife\u201d is a more pressing and higher concern\nthan that of \u201cknowledge,\u201d and that the quest for knowledge\nshould serve the interests of life. This parallels how, in The\nBirth of Tragedy, Nietzsche had looked at art through the\nperspective of life and foreshadows Nietzsche\u2019s hallmark theme\nof \u201clife-affirmation\u201d in his later works.\n\nThe third and fourth studies\u2014on Schopenhauer and Wagner,\nrespectively\u2014address how these two thinkers, as paradigms of\nphilosophic and artistic genius, hold the potential to inspire a\nstronger, healthier and livelier German culture. Nietzsche states here\nthat we all have a duty to help nature complete its goal of producing\nthe highest examples of the human being\u2014these will be the\n\u201cnew redeemers\u201d\u2014which he recognizes in superb\ninstances of the philosopher, the artist and the saint\n(\u201cSchopenhauer as Educator,\u201d Section 5). These celebratory\nstudies on Schopenhauer and Wagner reveal how, as a recurring feature\nof Nietzsche\u2019s thought, he presents us with some higher type of\ncharacter\u2014he offers different models of heroic characters as the\nyears go by\u2014as an ideal towards which he would have his best\nreaders aspire.\n3. Middle-Period Writings: 1878\u20131882\n\nNietzsche completed Human, All-Too-Human in 1878,\nsupplementing this with a second part in 1879, Mixed Opinions and\nMaxims (Vermischte Meinungen und Spr\u00fcche), and a\nthird part in 1880, The Wanderer and his Shadow (Der\nWanderer und sein Schatten). The three parts were published\ntogether in 1886 as Human All-Too-Human, A Book for Free\nSpirits (Menschliches, Allzumenschliches, Ein Buch f\u00fcr\nfreie Geister). Reluctant to construct a philosophical\n\u201csystem,\u201d and sensitive to the importance of style in\nphilosophic writing, Nietzsche composed these works as a series of\nseveral hundred short passages and aphorisms\u2014concise\ncondensations of his assorted insights\u2014whose typical length\nranges from a line or two to a page or two. Here, he often reflects\nupon cultural and psychological phenomena by connecting them to\nindividuals\u2019 organic and physiological constitutions. The idea\nof power (for which he would later become known) sporadically appears\nas an explanatory principle, but he tends at this time to invoke\nhedonistic considerations of pleasure and pain in his explanations of\ncultural and psychological phenomena. Given his harsh criticisms of\nhedonism and utilitarianism in later works (e.g., Thus Spoke\nZarathustra, re: \u201cthe Last Man\u201d), Human\nAll-Too-Human appears to many readers as an uncharacteristic\nwork, more science- than art-inspired in its approach to health, where\nNietzsche was struggling to break free of Wagner\u2019s spell, and\nwhich, presupposing a fundamentally hedonistic moral psychology, does\nnot fully embody the pain-and-power-centered approach that he later\ndeveloped.\n\nIn Daybreak: Reflections on Moral Prejudices\n(Morgenr\u00f6te. Gedanken \u00fcber die moralischen\nVorurteile, 1881), Nietzsche continues writing in his aphoristic\nstyle, but he marks a new beginning by accentuating as opposed to\npleasure, the importance of the \u201cfeeling of power\u201d in his\nunderstanding of human, and especially of so-called\n\u201cmoral\u201d behavior. Always having been interested in the\nnature of health, his emerging references to power stem from his\nearlier efforts to discover the secret of the ancient Greeks\u2019\noutstanding health, which he had regarded as the effects of how\n\u201cagon\u201d (i.e., competition, one-upmanship, or\ncontest, as conceived in his 1872 essay, \u201cHomer\u2019s\nContest\u201d) permeated their cultural attitudes. In this respect,\nDaybreak contains the seeds of Nietzsche\u2019s doctrine of\nthe \u201cwill to power\u201d\u2014a doctrine that appears\nexplicitly for the first time two years later in Thus Spoke\nZarathustra (1883\u201385). Daybreak is also one of\nNietzsche\u2019s clearest, intellectually calmest, and most intimate,\nvolumes, providing many social-psychological insights in conjunction\nwith some of his first sustained critical reflections on the cultural\nrelativity at the basis of Christian moral evaluations. In this\nbook\u2014as he remarks retrospectively in Ecce Homo\n(1888)\u2014Nietzsche begins his \u201ccrusade [Feldzug]\nagainst morality.\u201d\n\nIn a more well-known aphoristic work, The Gay Science\n(Die fr\u00f6hliche Wissenschaft, 1882)\u2014whose title was\ninspired by the troubadour songs of southern-French Provence\n(1100\u20131300)\u2014Nietzsche sets forth some of the existential\nideas for which he became famous, namely, the proclamation that\n\u201cGod is dead\u201d and the doctrine of eternal\nrecurrence\u2014a doctrine that attends to how people of different\nlevels of health are likely to react to the prospect of being reborn,\nover and over again, to replay life\u2019s experience exactly as\nbefore in every pleasurable and painful sequence of detail.\nNietzsche\u2019s atheism\u2014his account of \u201cGod\u2019s\nmurder\u201d (section 125)\u2014expresses in a literary manner, his\nphilosophical condemnation of all absolute perspectives and values.\nHis atheism also aims to redirect people\u2019s attention to their\ninherent freedom, the presently-existing world, and away from\nescapist, pain-relieving, heavenly otherworlds.\n\nTo a similar end, Nietzsche\u2019s doctrine of eternal recurrence\n(sections 285 and 341) serves to draw attention away from all worlds\nother than the one in which we presently live, since eternal\nrecurrence precludes the possibility of any final escape from the\npresent world. The doctrine also functions as a measure for judging\nsomeone\u2019s overall psychological strength and mental health,\nsince Nietzsche believed that the doctrine of eternal recurrence was\nthe hardest world-view to affirm. There are some differences of\nscholarly opinion concerning whether Nietzsche primarily intends this\ndoctrine to describe a serious metaphysical theory, or whether he is\noffering merely one way to interpret the world among many others,\nwhich if adopted therapeutically as a psychologically healthy myth,\ncan help us become stronger.\n\nIn 1887, The Gay Science was reissued with an important\npreface, an additional fifth Book, and an appendix of songs,\nreminiscent of the troubadours.\n4. Later-Period Writings: 1883\u20131887\n\nThus Spoke Zarathustra, A Book for All and None (Also\nSprach Zarathustra, Ein Buch f\u00fcr Alle und Keinen,\n1883\u201385), is one of Nietzsche\u2019s most famous works, and\nNietzsche regarded it as among his most significant. It is a manifesto\nof personal self-overcoming, and a guidebook for others towards the\nsame revitalizing end. Thirty years after its initial publication,\n150,000 copies of the work were printed by the German government and\nissued during WWI as inspirational reading to the young soldiers,\nalong with the Bible. Though Thus Spoke Zarathustra is\nantagonistic to the Judeo-Christian world-view, its poetic and\nprophetic style relies upon many, often inverted, Old and New\nTestament allusions. Nietzsche also filled the work with nature\nmetaphors, almost in the spirit of pre-Socratic naturalist philosophy,\nwhich invoke animals, earth, air, fire, water, celestial bodies,\nplants, all in the service of describing the spiritual development of\nZarathustra, a solitary, reflective, exceedingly strong-willed,\nsage-like, laughing and dancing voice of heroic self-mastery who,\naccompanied by a proud, sharp-eyed eagle and a wise snake, envisions a\nmode of psychologically healthier being beyond the common human\ncondition. Nietzsche refers to this higher mode of being as\n\u201csuperhuman\u201d (\u00fcbermenschlich), and\nassociates the doctrine of eternal recurrence\u2014a doctrine for\nonly the healthiest who can love life in its entirety\u2014with this\nspiritual standpoint, in relation to which all-too-often downhearted,\nall-too-commonly-human attitudes stand as a mere bridge to be crossed\nand overcome.\n\nWithin Nietzsche\u2019s corpus, Thus Spoke Zarathustra has a\ncontroversial place, owing mainly to its peculiar literary style.\nNietzsche speaks in parables and short narratives populated by\nfictional characters\u2014\u201cthe hunchback,\u201d \u201cthe\nugliest man,\u201d \u201cthe soothsayer,\u201d \u201cthe\nsaint,\u201d \u201cthe tightrope walker,\u201d \u201cthe\njester,\u201d and \u201cthe Last Man,\u201d to name a\nfew\u2014leaving their philosophical import open to a variety of\ninterpretations. One of Nietzsche\u2019s most well-known and morally\ntroubling figures\u2014the superhuman\u2014also appears\nsubstantially only in this work, rendering it questionable to some\ninterpreters whether this ideal of supreme human health is central to\nNietzsche\u2019s thought as a whole. There is also some interpretive\nuncertainty about whether the work, which was written across the span\nof three years, properly ends triumphantly at the conclusion of the\nThird Part, thus situating the psychologically complex Fourth Part as\na question-raising supplement, or whether the book\u2019s narrative\nmoves smoothly and progressively across the entire four parts.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil, Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future\n(Jenseits von Gut und B\u00f6se. Vorspiel einer Philosophie der\nZukunft, 1886) is arguably a rethinking of Human,\nAll-too-Human, since their respective tables of contents and\nsequence of themes loosely correspond to one another. In Beyond\nGood and Evil, Nietzsche identifies imagination, self-assertion,\ndanger, originality and the \u201ccreation of values\u201d as\nqualities of genuine philosophers, as opposed to mere scholars engaged\nin positive research in the sciences and humanities, or the dusty\nclassification of philosophical outlooks. Nietzsche takes aim at some\nof the world\u2019s great philosophers, who ground their outlooks\nwholeheartedly upon concepts such as \u201cself-consciousness,\u201d\n\u201cfree will,\u201d and \u201ceither/or\u201d bipolar\nthinking.\n\nNietzsche alternatively philosophizes from the perspective of life\nlocated beyond good and evil, and challenges the entrenched moral idea\nthat exploitation, domination, injury to the weak, destruction and\nappropriation are universally objectionable behaviors. Above all, he\nbelieves that living things aim to discharge their strength and\nexpress their \u201cwill to power\u201d\u2014a pouring-out of\nexpansive energy as if one were like a perpetually-shining sun that,\nquite naturally, can entail danger, pain, lies, deception and masks.\nHere, \u201cwill\u201d is not an inner emptiness, lack, feeling of\ndeficiency, or constant drive for satisfaction, but is a fountain of\nconstantly-swelling energy, life, and power.\n\nAs he views things from the perspective of life, Nietzsche further\ndenies that there is a universal morality applicable indiscriminately\nto all human beings, and instead designates a series of moralities in\nan order of rank that ascends from the plebeian to the noble: some\nmoralities are more suitable for subordinate roles; some are more\nappropriate for dominating and leading social roles. What counts as a\npreferable and legitimate action depends upon the kind of person one\nis. The deciding factor is whether one is weaker, sicker and on the\ndecline, or whether one is healthier, more powerful and overflowing\nwith life.\n\nOn the Genealogy of Morals, A Polemic (Zur Genealogie der\nMoral, Eine Streitschrift, 1887) is composed of three sustained\nessays that advance the critique of Christianity expressed in\nBeyond Good and Evil. The first essay continues the\ndiscussion of master morality versus servant morality, and maintains\nthat the traditional ideals set forth as holy and morally good within\nChristian morality are products of self-deception, since they were\nforged in the bad air of revenge, resentment, hatred, impotence, and\ncowardice. In this essay, as well as the next, Nietzsche\u2019s\ncontroversial references to the \u201cblond beast\u201d in\nconnection with master morality also appear. In the second essay,\nNietzsche continues with an account of how feelings of guilt, or the\n\u201cbad conscience,\u201d arise merely as a consequence of an\nunhealthy Christian morality that turns an evil eye towards our\nnatural inclinations. He also discusses how punishment, conceived as\nthe infliction of pain upon someone in proportion to their offense, is\nlikely to have been grounded in the contractual economic relationship\nbetween creditor and debtor, i.e., in business relationships. In the\nthird essay, Nietzsche focusses upon the truth-oriented ascetic ideals\nthat underlie and inform prevailing styles of art, religion and\nphilosophy, and he offers a particularly scathing critique of the\npriesthood: the priests are allegedly a group of weak people who\nshepherd even weaker people as a way to experience power for\nthemselves. The third essay also contains one of Nietzsche\u2019s\nclearest expressions of \u201cperspectivism\u201d (section\n12)\u2014the idea that there is no absolute, \u201cGod\u2019s\neye\u201d standpoint from which one can survey everything that\nis.\n\nOn the Genealogy of Morals is Nietzsche\u2019s\n\u201cpolemic,\u201d i.e., attack, against the assumptions and\nmethods (which, incidentally, are still popular) characteristic of\nworks such as Paul R\u00e9e\u2019s The Origin of the Moral\nSensations (1877). Inspired by utilitarianism and Darwinism,\nR\u00e9e offers a naturalistic account of our moral values,\nespecially altruism, but by Nietzsche\u2019s lights, does not\nquestion the value of the moral values themselves. In the\nGenealogy, Nietzsche offers a competing account of the origin\nof moral values, aiming to reveal their life-negating foundations and\nfunctions.\n\nNietzsche ultimately advocates valuations that issue from a\nself-confident, self-reinforcing, self-governing, creative and\ncommanding attitude, as opposed to those that issue from reactive\nattitudes that determine values more mechanically and subordinatingly\nto those who are inherently more powerful. For Nietzsche, those who\nprefer to think in terms of \u201cgood vs. bad\u201d exemplify the\nformer, leading and superior mentality, and those who think in terms\nof \u201cgood vs. evil,\u201d exemplify the latter, inferior and\nsubservient mentality. From the standpoint of a leader, in the\nappropriate circumstances it is good to be able to inflict pain and\ninstil fear among those who are led, and bad not to be able to do so.\nFrom the standpoint of those who are led, the infliction of pain and\ninstillation of fear upon subordinates does not appear typically to be\ngood at all, but rather evil.\n5. Final Writings of 1888\n\nThe Case of Wagner, A Musician\u2019s Problem (Der Fall\nWagner, Ein Musikanten-Problem, May-August 1888), contrasts\nsharply with Nietzsche\u2019s laudatory portrayal of Wagner in\nThe Birth of Tragedy (1872), and compares well with his 1873\nmeditation on David Strauss in its unbridled attack on a popular\ncultural figure. In The Case of Wagner, Nietzsche\n\u201cdeclares war\u201d upon Richard Wagner, whose music is\ncharacterized as the epitome of modern cultural achievement, but also\ncrucially as sick and decadent. The work is a brilliant display of\nNietzsche\u2019s talents as a music critic, and includes memorable\nridicule of Wagner\u2019s theatrical style, reflections on redemption\nvia art, a \u201cphysiology of art,\u201d and discussion of the\nvirtues associated, respectively, with ascending and descending life\nenergies. As the therapeutic inversion and antithesis of\nWagner\u2019s debilitatingly serious music, Nietzsche refers us to\nGeorges Bizet (1838\u20131875) whose music he finds cheerful,\nrevitalizing, redeeming and light-hearted. Wagner himself had some\nyears earlier (1850) condemned Felix Mendelssohn (1809\u20131847) for\nhaving confounded the public\u2019s taste in music. Nietzsche,\nwriting almost thirty years later, here accuses Wagner of having done\nthe same.\n\nThe title, Twilight of the Idols, or How One Philosophizes with a\nHammer (G\u00f6tzen-D\u00e4mmerung, oder Wie man mit dem\nHammer philosophiert, August-September 1888), word-plays upon\nWagner\u2019s opera, The Twilight of the Gods (Die\nG\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung). Nietzsche reiterates and elaborates\nsome of the criticisms of Socrates, Plato, Kant and Christianity found\nin earlier works, criticizes the then-contemporary German culture as\nbeing unsophisticated and too-full of beer, and shoots some\ndisapproving arrows at key French, British, and Italian cultural\nfigures such as Rousseau, Hugo, Sand, Michelet, Zola, Renan, Carlyle,\nMill, Eliot, Darwin, and Dante. In contrast to these alleged\nrepresentatives of cultural decadence, Nietzsche applauds Caesar,\nNapoleon, Goethe, Dostoevsky, Thucydides and the Sophists as healthier\nand stronger types. The phrase \u201cto philosophize with a\nhammer\u201d primarily signifies a way to test idols by tapping on\nthem lightly; one \u201csounds them out\u201d to determine whether\nthey are hollow, or intact, etc., as physician would use a percussion\nhammer upon the abdomen as a diagnostic instrument.\n\nIn The Antichrist, Curse on Christianity (Der Antichrist.\nFluch auf das Christentum, September 1888 [published 1895]),\nNietzsche expresses his disgust over the way noble values in Roman\nSociety were corrupted by the rise of Christianity, and he discusses\nspecific aspects and personages in Christian culture\u2014the\nGospels, Paul, the martyrs, priests, the crusades\u2014with a view\ntowards showing that Christianity is a religion for weak and unhealthy\npeople, whose general historical effect has been to undermine the\nhealthy qualities of the more noble cultures. The Antichrist\nwas initially conceived of as the first part of a projected four-part\nwork for which Nietzsche had in mind the title, Revaluation of All\nValues (the second part was to be entitled, \u201cThe Free\nSpirit\u201d). As in most of his 1888 works, Nietzsche criticizes,\neither implicitly or explicitly, the anti-Semitic writers of his day.\nIn this particular study, one of his main targets is the French,\nanti-Semitic, Christian historian, Ernest Renan (1823\u20131892), who\nwas known for works such as The Life of Jesus (1863) and\nHistory of the Origins of Christianity (1866\u20131881), the\nfourth book of which was entitled The Antichrist (1873). Some\ninterpret Nietzsche\u2019s title for his book as meaning, \u201cthe\nAntichristian.\u201d It should be noted that in an 1883 letter to his\nfriend, Peter Gast [Johann Heinrich K\u00f6selitz], Nietzsche does\ndescribe himself self-entertainingly as \u201cthe Antichrist,\u201d\nand also more seriously as \u201cthe most terrible opponent of\nChristianity.\u201d\n\nNietzsche describes himself as \u201ca follower of the philosopher\nDionysus\u201d in Ecce Homo, How One Becomes What One Is\n(Ecce Homo, Wie man wird, was man ist, October-November\n1888)\u2014a book in which he examines retrospectively his entire\ncorpus, work by work, offering critical remarks, details of how the\nworks were inspired, and explanatory observations regarding their\nphilosophical contents. He begins this fateful intellectual\nautobiography\u2014he was to lose his mind little more than a month\nlater\u2014with three eyebrow-raising sections entitled, \u201cWhy I\nAm So Wise,\u201d \u201cWhy I Am So Clever,\u201d and \u201cWhy I\nWrite Such Good Books.\u201d Nietzsche claims to be wise as a\nconsequence of his acute aesthetic sensitivity to nuances of health\nand sickness in people\u2019s attitudes and characters; he claims to\nbe clever because he knows how to choose the right nutrition, climate,\nresidence and recreation for himself; he claims to write such good\nbooks because they allegedly adventurously open up, at least for a\nvery select group of readers, a new series of noble and delicate\nexperiences. After examining each of his published works, Nietzsche\nconcludes Ecce Homo with the section, \u201cWhy I Am a\nDestiny.\u201d He claims that he is a destiny because he regards his\nanti-moral truths as having the annihilating power of intellectual\ndynamite; he expects them to topple the morality born of sickness\nwhich he perceives to have been reigning within Western culture for\nthe last two thousand years. In this way, he expresses his hope that\nDionysus, the god of life\u2019s exuberance, would replace Jesus, the\ngod of the heavenly otherworld, as the premier cultural standard for\nfuture millennia.\n\nAlthough Ecce Homo stands historically as Nietzsche\u2019s\nfinal autobiographical statement, if we consider that\u2014although\nthe plans were in flux\u2014Nietzsche was embarking on a new work, at\none point to be entitled, Revaluation of All Values, his 1888\nautobiographical excursion can be appreciated as a kind of\nhouse-cleaning and summing-up of where he had intellectually arrived\nat that point. Rather than being a final self-definition, it can be\nseen as yet another among Nietzsche\u2019s several efforts over the\nyears to clear the way for a freer intellectual development or\nmetamorphosis. In this respect, it compares to Thus Spoke\nZarathustra, Book IV, which appears to be Nietzsche\u2019s\nsquarely facing, almost as a kind of exorcism, the variety of inner\ncharacters that constituted his personality. Along the same lines,\nEcce Homo recalls the interval between\nHuman-All-too-Human and Daybreak, when Nietzsche\nplunged to a very low point in his health, coming close to death, and\nthen dramatically recuperated.\n\nNietzsche Contra Wagner, Out of the Files of a Psychologist\n(Nietzsche contra Wagner, Aktenst\u00fccke eines Psychologen,\nDecember 1888) is a short, but classic, selection of passages\nNietzsche extracted from his 1878\u20131887 published works. Many\nconcern Wagner, but the excerpts serve mostly as a foil for Nietzsche\nto express his own views against Wagner\u2019s. In this\nself-portrait, completed only a month before his collapse, Nietzsche\ncharacterizes his own anti-Christian sentiments, and contemplates how\neven the greatest people usually undergo significant corruption. In\nWagner\u2019s case, Nietzsche claims that the corrupting force was\nChristianity. One cannot help remembering here how, using the same\nkind of rationale, Wagner claimed that Felix Mendelssohn\u2019s\ncorrupting force was Judaism. At the same time, Nietzsche describes\nhow he truly admired some of Wagner\u2019s music for its profound\nexpressions of loneliness and suffering\u2014expressions which\nNietzsche admitted were psychologically impossible for he himself to\narticulate.\n\nThe writings of Nietzsche\u2019s final active year are peppered with\nsome wild phrasings, but they remain lucid and philosophically\npenetrating on the whole. Given the utter loss of Nietzsche\u2019s\nintellectual capacities upon his collapse, this prior lucidity is\npuzzling. The abruptness of his breakdown in combination with the\nlucidity of his final writings has fed speculation that rather than\nsuffering from a slowly progressive mental disease, Nietzsche had a\nphysical condition (e.g., a brain tumor) whose silent growth\neventually reached a critical mass that caused his mental composure to\nsnap.\n6. Nietzsche\u2019s Unpublished Notebooks\n\nNietzsche\u2019s unpublished writings often reveal his more tentative\nand speculative ideas. This material is surrounded by controversy,\nsince some of it conflicts with views he expresses in his published\nworks. Disagreement regarding Nietzsche\u2019s notebooks, also known\nas his Nachlass, centers around the degree of interpretive\npriority which ought to be given to the unpublished versus the\npublished writings. One popular approach in the tradition of classical\nscholarly interpretation is to maintain that Nietzsche\u2019s\npublished works express his more considered and polished views, and\nthat these should take precedence over the unpublished manuscripts\nwhen conflicts arise; a second attitude, given voice by Martin\nHeidegger (who lectured on Nietzsche in Nazi Germany,\n1936\u20131940), and broadly consistent with a psychoanalytic\napproach as well, is to regard what Nietzsche published as\nrepresentative of what he decided was publicly presentable, and what\nhe kept privately to himself in unpublished form as containing his\nmore authentic views; a third, more comprehensive, interpretive style\ntries to grasp all of Nietzsche\u2019s texts together in an effort to\nform the most coherent interpretation of Nietzsche\u2019s thought,\njudging the priority of published versus unpublished works on a\nthematic, or case-by-case basis; a fourth position influenced by the\nFrench deconstructionist perspective maintains that any rigid\nprioritizing between published and private works is impossible, since\nall of the texts embody a comparable multidimensionality of\nmeaning.\n\nIn his unpublished manuscripts, Nietzsche sometimes elaborates the\ntopics found in the published works, such as his early 1870s\nnotebooks, where there is important material concerning his theory of\nknowledge. In the 1880s notebooks\u2014those from which his sister\ncollected together a large selection after his death under the title,\nThe Will to Power: Attempt at a Revaluation of all\nValues\u2014Nietzsche sometimes adopts a more metaphysical\norientation towards the doctrines of Eternal Recurrence and the Will\nto Power, speculating upon their structure, implications, and\nintellectual strength as interpretations of reality itself.\nSide-by-side with these speculations, and complicating efforts towards\ndeveloping an interpretation which is both comprehensive and coherent,\nNietzsche\u2019s 1880s notebooks also repeatedly state that\n\u201cthere are no facts, only interpretations.\u201d\n7. Nietzsche\u2019s Influence Upon 20th Century Thought\n\nNietzsche\u2019s thought extended a deep influence during the 20th\ncentury, especially in Continental Europe. In English-speaking\ncountries, his positive reception has been less resonant. During the\nlast decade of Nietzsche\u2019s life and the first decade of the 20th\ncentury, his thought was particularly attractive to avant-garde\nartists who saw themselves on the periphery of established social\nfashion and practice. Here, Nietzsche\u2019s advocacy of new, healthy\nbeginnings, and of creative artistry in general stood forth. His\ntendency to seek explanations for commonly-accepted values and\noutlooks in the less-elevated realms of sheer animal instinct was also\ncrucial to Sigmund Freud\u2019s development of psychoanalysis. Later,\nduring the 1930s, aspects of Nietzsche\u2019s thought were espoused\nby the Nazis and Italian Fascists, partly due to the encouragement of\nElisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche through her associations with Adolf\nHitler and Benito Mussolini. It was possible for the Nazi interpreters\nto assemble, quite selectively, various passages from\nNietzsche\u2019s writings whose juxtaposition appeared to justify\nwar, aggression and domination for the sake of nationalistic and\nracial self-glorification.\n\nUntil the 1960s in France, Nietzsche appealed mainly to writers and\nartists, since the academic philosophical climate was dominated by\nG.W.F. Hegel\u2019s, Edmund Husserl\u2019s and Martin\nHeidegger\u2019s thought, along with the structuralist movement of\nthe 1950s. Nietzsche became especially influential in French\nphilosophical circles during the 1960s\u20131980s, when his\n\u201cGod is dead\u201d declaration, his perspectivism, and his\nemphasis upon power as the real motivator and explanation for\npeople\u2019s actions revealed new ways to challenge established\nauthority and launch effective social critique. In the\nEnglish-speaking world, Nietzsche\u2019s unfortunate association with\nthe Nazis kept him from serious philosophical consideration until the\n1950s and 60s, when landmark works such as Walter Kaufmann\u2019s,\nNietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist (1950) and\nArthur C. Danto\u2019s, Nietzsche as Philosopher (1965),\npaved the way for a more open-minded discussion.\n\nSpecific 20th century figures who were influenced, either quite\nsubstantially, or in a significant part, by Nietzsche include\npainters, dancers, musicians, playwrights, poets, novelists,\npsychologists, sociologists, literary theorists, historians, and\nphilosophers: Alfred Adler, Georges Bataille, Martin Buber, Albert\nCamus, E.M. Cioran, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Isadora Duncan,\nMichel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, Stefan George, Andr\u00e9 Gide,\nHermann Hesse, Carl Jung, Martin Heidegger, Gustav Mahler,\nAndr\u00e9 Malraux, Thomas Mann, H.L. Mencken, Rainer Maria Rilke,\nJean-Paul Sartre, Max Scheler, Giovanni Segantini, George Bernard\nShaw, Lev Shestov, Georg Simmel, Oswald Spengler, Richard Strauss,\nPaul Tillich, Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies, Mary Wigman, William Butler\nYeats and Stefan Zweig.\n\nThat Nietzsche was able to write so prolifically and profoundly for\nyears, while remaining in a condition of ill-health and often intense\nphysical pain, is a testament to his spectacular mental capacities and\nwill power. Lesser people under the same physical pressures might not\nhave had the inclination to pick up a pen, let alone think and record\nthoughts which\u2014created in the midst of striving for healthy\nself-overcoming\u2014would have the power to influence an entire\ncentury.\n",
