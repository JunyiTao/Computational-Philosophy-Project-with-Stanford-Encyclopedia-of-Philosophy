    "main_text": "Modal Conditions || Sensitivity\n5.1 Sensitivity\n\nAnother candidate fourth condition on knowledge is\nsensitivity. Sensitivity, to a first approximation, is this\ncounterfactual relation:\n\n\nS\u2019s belief that p is sensitive if and only if, if\np were false, S would not believe that\n p.[14]\n\n\nA sensitivity condition on knowledge was defended by Robert Nozick\n(1981). Given a Lewisian (Lewis 1973) semantics for counterfactual\nconditionals, the sensitivity condition is equivalent to the\nrequirement that, in the nearest possible worlds in which\nnot-p, the subject does not believe that p.\n\nOne motivation for including a sensitivity condition in an analysis of\nknowledge is that there seems to be an intuitive sense in which\nknowledge requires not merely being correct, but tracking the\ntruth in other possible circumstances. This approach seems to be a\nplausible diagnosis of what goes wrong in at least some Gettier cases.\nFor example, in Dharmottara\u2019s desert water case, your belief\nthat there is water in a certain location appears to be insensitive to\nthe fact of the water. For if there were no water there, you would\nhave held the same belief on the same grounds\u2014viz., the\nmirage.\n\nHowever, it is doubtful that a sensitivity condition can account for\nthe phenomenon of Gettier cases in general. It does so only in cases\nin which, had the proposition in question been false, it would have\nbeen believed anyway. But, as Saul Kripke (2011: 167\u201368) has\npointed out, not all Gettier cases are like this. Consider for\ninstance the Barn County case mentioned above. Henry looks at a\nparticular location where there happens to be a barn and believes\nthere to be a barn there. The sensitivity condition rules out this\nbelief as knowledge only if, were there no barn there, Henry would\nstill have believed there was. But this counterfactual may be false,\ndepending on how the Barn County case is set up. For instance, it is\nfalse if the particular location Henry is examining is not one that\nwould have been suitable for the erecting of a barn fa\u00e7ade.\nRelatedly, as Kripke has also indicated (2011: 186), if we suppose\nthat barn facades are always green, but genuine barns are always red,\nHenry\u2019s belief that he sees a red barn will be\nsensitive, even though his belief that he sees a barn will\nnot. (We assume Henry is unaware that colour signifies anything\nrelevant.) Since intuitively, the former belief looks to fall short of\nknowledge in just the same way as the latter, a sensitivity condition\nwill only handle some of the intuitive problems deriving from Gettier\ncases.\n\nMost epistemologists today reject sensitivity requirements on\nknowledge. The chief motivation against a sensitivity condition is\nthat, given plausible assumptions, it leads to unacceptable\nimplications called \u201cabominable \n conjunctions\u201d.[15]\n To see this, suppose first that\nskepticism about ordinary knowledge is false\u2014ordinary subjects\nknow at least many of the things we ordinarily take them to know. For\nexample, George, who can see and use his hands perfectly well, knows\nthat he has hands. This is of course perfectly consistent with a\nsensitivity condition on knowledge, since if George did not\nhave hands\u2014if they\u2019d been recently chopped off, for\ninstance\u2014he would not believe that he had hands.\n\nNow imagine a skeptical scenario in which George does not have hands.\nSuppose that George is the victim of a Cartesian demon, deceiving him\ninto believing that he has hands. If George were in such a scenario,\nof course, he would falsely believe himself not to be in such a\nscenario. So given the sensitivity condition, George cannot know that\nhe is not in such a scenario.\n\nAlthough these two verdicts\u2014the knowledge-attributing one about\nordinary knowledge, and the knowledge-denying one about the skeptical\nscenario\u2014are arguably each intuitive, it is intuitively\nproblematic to hold them together. Their conjunction is, in\nDeRose\u2019s term, abominable: \u201cGeorge knows that he has\nhands, but he doesn\u2019t know that he\u2019s not the handless\nvictim of a Cartesian demon\u201d. A sensitivity condition on\nknowledge, combined with the nonskeptical claim that there is ordinary\nknowledge, seems to imply such abominable\n conjunctions.[16]\n\nMost contemporary epistemologists have taken considerations like these\nto be sufficient reason to reject sensitivity \n conditions.[17]\n However, see\nIchikawa (2011a) for an interpretation and endorsement of the\nsensitivity condition according to which it may avoid commitment to\nabominable conjunctions.\n",
