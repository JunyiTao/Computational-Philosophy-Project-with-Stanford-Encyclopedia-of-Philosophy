    "main_text": "The Character of Auriol\u2019s Thought and Some Noteworthy Positions || The Concept of Being\n2.2 The Concept of Being\n\nAuriol modified Scotus\u2019 view on the univocity of the concept of\nbeing. While accepting Scotus\u2019 view that \u2018being\u2019 is\nunivocal both between God and creatures and between substance and\naccidents, Auriol nevertheless heavily criticized Scotus for\nmaintaining that being was contracted to the most general genera\nthrough various \u201cqualitative differences\u201d that themselves\nwere not included under the concept of being; on Scotus\u2019 view,\nbeing itself became like a genus that was contracted through an\noutside difference. Auriol rejected this view on the grounds that this\n\u201coutside difference\u201d was an illusion; according to Auriol,\nnothing escapes the concept of being. Instead Auriol maintains that\nthe concept of being is an indeterminate concept that grasps\nall beings at once and equally. This concept of being itself has no\ndeterminate content; instead it contains within itself implicitly all\nother concepts that the intellect could possibly form. Being, then,\nfor Auriol is not contracted to its inferiors through any added\ndifference, but merely through explicating what is already contained\nimplicitly and indeterminately in the concept of being (Brown 1964;\nBrown 1965; Goris 2002; Pickav\u00e9 2004; Aertsen 2012, pp.\n433\u201356). As with many other topics, the history of the reception\nof Auriol\u2019s view on the univocity of the concept of being\nremains to be written, but the important fifteenth century Thomist,\nJohn Capreolus, copied half of his eleven page treatment of this issue\nverbatim from Auriol\u2019s Scriptum only to reject\nAuriol\u2019s view in favor of a more Thomistic one. (See Brown 1964,\np. 6, esp. n. 10.)\n",
