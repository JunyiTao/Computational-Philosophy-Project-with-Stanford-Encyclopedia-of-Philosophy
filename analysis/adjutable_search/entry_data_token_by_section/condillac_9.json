    "main_text": "Problems with Condillac\u2019s Sensationism || Materialism\n10.2 Materialism\n\nCondillac\u2019s account of sensation also fit uneasily with his\nclaim that the mind is immaterial. He took sensations to be\nmodifications of the mind\u2019s being. He also stipulated that such\nthings as colours and scents are sensations. In the Essay, he\nspecified that there is nothing in bodies that resembles colours or\nscents and that these qualities are something that belongs to sentient\ncreatures alone (Essay I.i.2. \u00a712). In the\nTreatise, employing a striking turn of phrase, he claimed\nthat while we might think of a being who possessed only the sense of\nsmell as a being who scents a rose, for itself this being will simply\nbe the smell of a rose. \u201cFrom its perspective,\u201d he wrote,\n\u201cthe odours are nothing other than its own modifications or\nmanners of being\u201d (Treatise I.i.2). The same holds of\ncolours. A being whom we would describe as seeing red would at first\nexperience itself as simply being red. Touch would instruct it to\nattribute this redness to other objects. But this instruction cannot\nbe known to be correct, whereas there can be no question that the\nsensation of red is a modification of the being of a sentient\ncreature. Red is not, therefore, what might be called the intentional\nobject of an act of sensing, or if it is, it is so only derivatively;\nit is primarily a quality of the sentient being, who experiences\nitself as literally turning red when it has this sensation\n(Treatise I.xi.8). \n\nThe problem with this position becomes clear when it is considered\nthat Condillac also maintained that colours are extended. In the\nEssay he claimed that were we to have no other sensations\nthan those of light and colour they would \u201ctrace\n(traceront) extension, lines, and figures before our\neyes\u201d so that we would find these ideas to be contained in our\nsensations (Essay I.i.2. \u00a79). Moreover, this discovery\nis not an effect of learning or association. Extension and shape are\noriginal features possessed by visual sensations, discernible simply\nby attentive reflection. Someone blind since birth and newly made to\nsee would not originally perceive everything before him as if it were\na \u201cpoint\u201d (i.e., an unextended spot of colour), but would\nexperience \u201clight distributed (r\u00e9pandue) in\nevery direction [outwards as well as above, below, to the left and to\nthe right]\u201d (Essay I.vi. \u00a7\u00a712, 14). Condillac\ncontinued to retain this view in the Treatise, though with\nsome refinements: Whereas in the Essay he had maintained that\ncolours are extended over all three dimensions, in the\nTreatise he endorsed the Berkeleyan position that we learn to\nperceive depth. He also maintained that we do not immediately\nappreciate that colours are bounded and figured even in two\ndimensions, but need to learn that they have these features. But he\ncontinued to maintain that the colours we originally experience are\nextended over two dimensions. \u201cColour presents [offre]\nextension to the soul that it modifies,\u201d he wrote in the\nTreatise, \u201cbecause it is itself extended. This is a\nfact that cannot be brought into doubt. It is demonstrated by\nobservation\u201d (Treatise I.xi.8). Insofar as colours are\nextended they must have shapes, even if those shapes are not\nimmediately perceived. The process of learning to perceive shape does\nnot transform our colour sensations and lead them to acquire\nproperties they did not previously have; it merely leads us to\ndiscover ones that were there all along. This is the point of claiming\nthat not everything that is necessarily involved with a sensation need\nbe perceived by it.\n\nCondillac thus appears to have been committed to four mutually\nantagonistic propositions:\n\nColours are extended.\nColours are sensations.\nSensations are modifications of the mind\u2019s being.\nThe mind is unextended.\n\n\nHume had confronted the conflict between these propositions by denying\n(3) and (4). For Hume, our visual impressions are compounds that\nconsist of a number of minimally visible, coloured points that are\ndisposed alongside another in space, but the notion that impressions\nand ideas inhere in some mental substance is unintelligible, whether\nthis substance is taken to be material or immaterial. Reid, in\ncontrast, had insisted on (3) and (4) but had declared that the term\n\u201ccolour\u201d is used equivocally in (1) and (2). We experience\nsensations of colour, which are unextended states of feeling\nexperienced by the mind in just the same way as it experiences\nfeelings of pleasure or pain. But colour terminology is most often\nused to refer to some unknown thing in external objects that causes us\nto experience these sensations. These external, so-called\n\u201ccoloured\u201d objects are conceived as being extended and\nfigured, but the mind does not become aware of them by contemplating\nsome internal, iconic representation or image. It has a thought that\nrefers to them. Affection of our sense organs does not produce an\nimpression or image; it occasions a thought. The thought itself is\nunextended, like the mind whose state it is, but it is a thought\nof or about an object. The object is thought to\npossess a quality of extension, as well as to be a cause of a certain\nconcomitant sensation of colour. But the thought that this\nobject is extended and a cause of a sensation of colour is itself\nneither extended nor coloured. So for Reid, either\n\u201ccolours\u201d are powers in extended, external objects to\nbring about sensations in us, in which case they are not sensations\nhad by the mind, or they are sensations had by the mind, in which case\nthey are not extended. \n\nHowever, unlike Hume and Reid, Condillac was unwilling to deny or\nqualify any of (1)-(4). Unlike Hume, he insisted on the existence of\nan immaterial mind who is the subject of sensations of colour\n(Essay I.i.1. \u00a76). And unlike Reid, he insisted that\ncolours are unequivocally both modifications of the mind\u2019s being\nand literally extended. These commitments exposed him to charges of\ntacit materialism. Most notably, Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur, writing\nunder the pseudonym of the Abb\u00e9 de Lignac, observed in the\nsupplements to his Lettres \u00e0 un Am\u00e9rican\n(1756), that just as Condillac had accused Buffon of supposing that\nmachines have a quality that is essential to spirits, sensibility, so\nCondillac was liable to the charge of supposing that spirits have a\nquality that belongs uniquely to machines, three dimensionality.\n\nCondillac\u2019s response to this charge, in his \u201cLettre de M.\nl\u2019abb\u00e9 de Condillac \u00e0 l\u2019auteur des Lettres\n\u00e0 un Am\u00e9rican\u201d (1756, and appended to subsequent\neditions of the Treatise on Animals) was to claim that,\n\u201cIf I say that our sensations give us an idea of extension, it\nis only because we take them for qualities of objects when we refer\nthem to something external. But I have proven many times that they\ncertainly do not give us this idea when we consider them as a manner\nof being of our soul.\u201d This echoes claims made in the\nEssay and the Treatise. In the Essay,\nCondillac claimed that we attribute the extension or shape we find in\ncolours to something outside of us rather than to ourselves considered\nas thinking subjects (I.i.2. \u00a711), presumably because extension\nis incompatible with the simplicity that must be ascribed to a\nthinking being. In almost the same breath, he claimed that we are\nwrong to imagine that the chromatic quality of colours (as opposed to\nthe extension and shape they map out) actually lies on the surface of\nexternal objects, purportedly because we have no clear idea of what it\nwould mean for a body to be coloured (I.i.2. \u00a712). But such\nclaims are hardly adequate to avoid the problem and perhaps not even\ncoherent. Either the chromatic qualities that we experience as\nmodifications of our being are extended or they are not. If they are\nextended, then the claim that we do not recognize this fact when we\nthink of them as modifications of our own being is merely an evasion.\nIf they are not extended, then if we never experience anything other\nthan our own sensations, as Condillac claimed at the outset of the\nEssay, it is mysterious how we come to attribute extension to\nexternal objects.\n\nIn the Treatise, Condillac was no longer willing to declare\nthat objects can be known to be either extended or colourless. He\nsimply claimed that its experiences would lead his\n\u201cstatue\u201d to first conceive of colours as modifications of\nits own being, then to conceive them as modifications of its extended\nsense organs, and finally to conceive them as modifications of\nexternal objects (Treatise III.3). But this was not to answer\nthe metaphysical problem but rather to ignore it. If colours are in\nfact extended, as the Treatise continued to insist, yet the\nmind ultimately only knows its own sensations, however variously they\nmight be transformed by cognitive processing, then we can only come to\nbe in a position to attribute colours to external objects if we first\nexperience those colours, which suggests that they must modify our\nbeing.\n\nThough Condillac\u2019s official reply to the charge of materialism,\nas expressed in the letter to Lignac, is something of a\ndisappointment, scholars have occasionally read the Treatise\nas taking some steps towards a more radical way of dealing with the\nproblem. Recall that in that work Condillac advanced the view that\neven though colours are in fact extended and bounded, it is not\nintuitively evident that they are. We need to learn to see their\nshapes. Interestingly, what teaches us to see these shapes are tactile\nsensations of solidity and observations of the appearance and\ndisappearance of colours consequent upon moving our hands before our\neyes. Since neither sensations of solidity nor the tactile sensations\nthat accompany hand motions are patently extensive in character, and\ncolours themselves might as well not be so far as the early learner is\nconcerned, some scholars have suggested that the Condillac of the\nTreatise meant to claim that our perceptions of space are\nconstructed from raw data that, as they are at first experienced by\nthe mind, are in no way spatial. Insofar as the Treatise does\nmove towards this more radical view, it can be seen as a precursor of\nsuch 19th century Berkeleyan theories of vision as those of Steinbuch,\nMill, Helmholtz, and Wundt. However, those later theories invoked\nnotions of local signs (sensations specific to which nerve is being\nstimulated) and made explicit appeals to kinaesthetic sensations that\nare simply absent from Condillac\u2019s work. Lacking those notions,\nCondillac claimed that an awareness of space cannot be generated from\naspatial sensations, and he represented his statue, not as\nconstructing space, but as discovering the spatial features that were\nalready present in its sensations from the first. Viewing him as a\nprecursor of 19th century Berkeleyanism risks overlooking this fact\nand, as a consequence, misrepresenting his thought.\n",
