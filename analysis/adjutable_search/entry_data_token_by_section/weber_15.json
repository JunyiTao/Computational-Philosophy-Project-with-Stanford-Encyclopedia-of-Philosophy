    "main_text": "Politics and Ethics || Democracy, Partisanship, and Compromise\n6.2 Democracy, Partisanship, and Compromise\n\nAll in all, the irony is unmistakable. It seems as though one of the\nmost influential political thinkers of the twentieth century cannot\ncome to clear terms with its zeitgeist in which democracy, in whatever\nform, shape and shade, emerged as the only acceptable ground for\npolitical legitimacy. Weber\u2019s such awkwardness is nowhere more\ncompelling than in his advocacy for \u201cleadership democracy\u201d\n(F\u00fchrerdemokratie) during the constitutional politics of\npost-WWI Germany.\n\nIf the genuine self-rule of the people is impossible, according to his\nunsentimental outlook on democracy, the only choice is one between\nleaderless and leadership democracy. When advocating a sweeping\ndemocratization of defeated Germany, thus, Weber envisioned democracy\nin Germany as a political marketplace in which strong charismatic\nleaders can be identified and elected by winning votes in a free\ncompetition, even battle, among themselves. Preserving and enhancing\nthis element of struggle in politics is important since it is only\nthrough a dynamic electoral process that national leadership strong\nenough to control the otherwise omnipotent bureaucracy can be made.\nThe primary concern for Weber in designing democratic institutions\nhas, in other words, less to do with the realization of democratic\nideals, such as freedom, equality, justice, or self-rule, than with\ncultivation of certain character traits befitting a robust national\nleadership. In its overriding preoccupation with the leadership\nqualities, Weber\u2019s theory of democracy contains ominous streaks\nthat may vindicate J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s infamous dictum that\nCarl Schmitt, \u201cthe Kronjurist of the Third\nReich,\u201d was \u201ca legitimate pupil of Weber\u2019s\u201d\n[Habermas in Stammer (ed.) 1971, 66].\n\nFor a fair and comprehensive assessment, however, it should also be\nbrought into purview that Weber\u2019s leadership democracy is not\nsolely reliant upon the fortuitous personality traits of its leaders,\nlet alone a caesaristic dictator. \u201c[A] genuine charisma is\nradically different from the convenient presentation of the present\n\u2018divine right of king\u2019\u2026 the very opposite is true\nof the genuinely charismatic ruler, who is responsible to the\nruled\u201d [1922/1978, 1114]. Such responsibility is conceivable\nbecause charisma is attributed to a leader through a process that can\nbe described as \u201cimputation\u201d from below [Joose\n2014, 271]. In addition to the free electoral competition led by the\norganized mass parties, Weber saw localized, yet public associational\nlife as a breeding ground for such an imputation of charisma. When\nleaders are identified and selected at the level of, say neighborhood\nchoral societies and bowling clubs [Weber 1910/2002], the alleged\nauthoritarian elitism of leadership democracy comes across as more\npluralistic in its valence, far from its usual identification with\ndemagogic dictatorship and unthinking mass following. Insofar as a\nvibrant civil society functions as an effective medium for the\nhorizontal diffusion of charismatic qualities among lay people, his\nnotion of charismatic leadership can retain a strongly democratic tone\nto the extent that he also suggested associational pluralism as a\nsociocultural ground for the political education of the lay citizenry\nfrom which genuine leaders would hail. Weber\u2019s charismatic\nleadership has to be \u201cdemocratically manufactured\u201d [Green\n2008, 208], in short, and such a formative political project is\npredicated upon a pluralistically organized civil society as well as\nsuch liberal institutions as universal suffrage, free elections, and\norganized parties.\n\nIn this respect, however, it should be noted that Weber\u2019s take\non civil society is crucially different from a\ncommunitarian-Tocquevillean outlook, and this contrast can be cast\ninto sharper relief once put in terms of the contemporary democratic\ntheory of partisanship [cf., inter alia, Rosenblum 2008;\nMuirhead 2014; White and Ypi 2016]. Like the contemporary advocates of\npartisanship, Weber is critical of the conventional communitarian view\nthat simply equates civil society with voluntary associational life\nitself. For not all voluntary associations are conducive to democracy;\nsome are in fact \u201cbad\u201d for its viability. Even in a\n\u201cgood\u201d civil society, those \u201cassociative\npractice,\u201d or Vergesellschaftung in Weber\u2019s\nparlance [Weber 1910/2002], may cultivate the kind of civil\nvirtues that regulate our private lives, but such social capital\ncannot be automatically transferred to the public realm as a useful\nset of civic virtues and skills for democratic politics.\nPolitical capital can be acquired by living political\nexperiences daily. This realization led Weber as well as a growing\nnumber of contemporary democratic theorists to converge on an\ninsistent call for the politicization of civil society in the form of\nnot less, but better partisanship, making his politics of civil\nsociety crucially different from that of a communitarian-Tocquevillean\npersuasion [see Kim in Hanke, Scaff & Whimster (eds.) 2020].\n\nAlso different from this intensely political civil society is a\nliberal-Habermasian \u201cpublic sphere,\u201d a\nrational-communicative haven in which the open exchange and fair\ndeliberation of impartial opinions take place until reasonable\nconsensus emerges. By contrast, Weber\u2019s civil society is to be\nan agonistic arena of organized rivalry, competition, and struggle on\nbehalf of the irreducibly partial claims between which\nconsensus \u2013 be that reasonable, overlapping, or bipartisan\n\u2013 may not always be found. Given the incommensurable value\nfragmentation of the modern politics and society, Weber would\nwholeheartedly embrace the so-called \u201ccircumstances of\npolitics\u201d under which deep disagreements are reasonable\nand permanent, agreeing that it is not necessarily a bad\nthing for democracy as long as those \u201cpermanent\ndisagreements\u201d remain peaceful [Waldron 1999]. From such an\nagonistic perspective, the best that can be expected is some kind of\nmixture of those partial claims \u2013 a compromise wherein\nlies the true meaning of political virtue. That is to say,\nalthough no \u201coverlapping consensus\u201d can be expected, it is\nprecisely because all partisan claims are so partial that a political\ncompromise can be made at least between good partisans. For\nneither too unprincipled (as in opportunistic power-seekers) nor too\nprincipled (as in moral zealots), good partisan citizens welcome a\npolitical compromise, albeit their passionate value convictions,\nbecause they know that some reasonable disagreements are permanent.\nThen, the kind of political capital expected to be accumulated in a\ngood partisan civil society is a mixture of \u201cprinciple and\npragmatism\u201d [Muirhead 2014, 41\u201342] \u2013 a political\nvirtue much akin to Weber\u2019s syncretic ethics of conviction\n(Gesinnungsethik) and responsibility\n(Verantwortungsethik) [see 6.3 below].\n\nTogether, Weber\u2019s ethics also demand that the political leaders\nand public citizenry combine unflinching commitments to higher causes\n(which make them different from mere bureaucratic careerists) with\nsober realism that no political claim, including their own, can\nrepresent the whole truth (which makes them different from moral\npurists and political romantics). This syncretic ethic is the ultimate\nhallmark of those politicians with a sense of vocation who would fight\nfor their convictions with fierce determination yet not without a\n\u201csense of pragmatic judgment\u201d\n(Augenma\u00df)that a compromise is unavoidable between\nincommensurable value positions, and all they can do in the end is to\ntake robust responsibility for the consequences, either intended or\nunintended, of what they thought was a principled compromise.\nThis is why Weber said: \u201cThe politician must make compromises\n\u2026 the scholar may not cover them (Der Politiker\nmu\u00df Kompromisse machen \u2026 der Gelehrte darf sie nicht\ndecken)\u201d [MWG II/10, 983; also see Bruun 1972 (2007, 244)]. It is\nthis type of political virtue that Weber wants to instill at the\ncitizenship as well as leadership level, and the site of this\npolitical education is a pluralistically organized civil society in\nwhich leaders and citizens can experience the dynamic and\ninstitutionalized politicization (re)produced by partisan\npolitics.\n",
