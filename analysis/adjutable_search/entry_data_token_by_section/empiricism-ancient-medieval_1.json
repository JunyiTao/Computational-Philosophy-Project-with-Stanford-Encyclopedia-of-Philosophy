This is certainly the\ncase with the term \u201cempiricism\u201d: while it is difficult\nsimply to abandon it, it can be misleading. Among historians of early\nmodern philosophy, for instance, the traditional distinction between\nempiricists and rationalists has fallen out of favour, on the grounds\nthat there are few thinkers who can be clearly assigned to either\ncategory (Norton 1981; Loeb 1981: 25\u201375). The problem here,\nhowever, is not the category of empiricism, but its use as a\n\u201cpigeon-hole\u201d into which one tries to place individual\nthinkers. Empiricism need not be a global doctrine: a thinker may be\nan empiricist in one domain but not in another. It is possible, for\ninstance, to be an empiricist about knowledge of the natural world,\nbut a rationalist with regard to a particular area of mathematics\n(Markie 2015: sect. 1.2). So it is not surprising that individual\nthinkers are hard to categorize. But empiricism is also an umbrella\nterm: it covers a variety of views regarding knowledge. Even with\nregard to the one domain, a thinker may be an empiricist in one sense,\nbut not in another. So if we are to use the term, we need to\ndistinguish the different forms empiricism can take.\n",
