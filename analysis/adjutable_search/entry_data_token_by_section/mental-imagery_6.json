We have seen the debate about the\nphenomenal similarities and differences between mental imagery and\nperception in Section 1.4. But there is an even more important\nquestion about the relation between mental imagery and perception,\nnamely, about whether and in what sense perception depends on mental\nimagery. This has been a dominant theme in the history of philosophy\nand Immanuel Kant was probably the most explicit proponent of a fairly\nstrong constitutive dependence claim. Kant famously claimed that\nimagination is \u201ca necessary ingredient of perception\nitself\u201d (Critique of Pure Reason, A120, fn. A) and this\nclaim has become quite influential not just in philosophy (Strawson\n1974, p. 54, Sellars 1978), but in the history of ideas in general.\nEug\u00e8ne Delacroix, for example, wrote in his diary on September\n1, 1859 that \u201cEven when we look at nature, our imagination\nconstructs the picture\u201d (see also Briscoe 2018 and Van Leeuwen\n2011 for examples of perception/mental imagery hybrid).\n\nAs we have seen in Section 1.3, in Kant\u2019s time, imagination and\nmental imagery were not systematically kept apart and a charitable\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s claim would be that what is a necessary\ningredient of perception itself is not voluntary imagination (as we\ndon\u2019t voluntarily imagine each time we perceive), but rather\nmental imagery (see Strawson 1974 and Gregory 2017 for discussion of\njust how charitable such interpretation would be). So the charitable\ninterpretation of the Kantian Thesis is that mental imagery is a\nnecessary ingredient of perception itself.\n\nThis is a constitutive claim: perception doesn\u2019t merely depend\non mental imagery causally, it depends on mental imagery\nconstitutively. This, like all constitutive claims, is a fairly strong\none, and a much more modest, also historically influential,\npre-Kantian, view dominant among, for example, the British\nempiricists, would be that perception does not depend on mental\nimagery at all, of if it does, it depends on it merely causally. While\nthere has never been an explicit debate between these two positions,\nrecent empirical research helps us to assess the respective merits of\nthese two ways of thinking about the relation between perception and\nmental imagery.\n",
