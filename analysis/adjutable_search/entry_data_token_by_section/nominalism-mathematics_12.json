I am calling the view\n\u2018deflationary nominalism\u2019 given that it demands very\nminimal commitments to make sense of mathematics (Azzouni 2004), it\nadvances a deflationary view of truth (Azzouni 2004, 2006), and\nadvocates a direct formulation of mathematical theories, without\nrequiring that they be reconstructed or rewritten (Azzouni 1994,\n2004).\nDeflationary nominalism offers an \u2018easy road\u2019 to\nnominalism, which does not require any form of reformulation of\nmathematical discourse, while granting the indispensability of\nmathematics. Despite the fact that quantification over mathematical\nobjects and relations is indispensable to our best theories of the\nworld, this fact offers no reason to believe in the existence of the\ncorresponding entities. This is because, as Jody Azzouni points out,\ntwo kinds of commitment should be distinguished: quantifier\ncommitment and ontological commitment (Azzouni 1997; 2004,\np. 127 and pp. 49\u2013122). We incur a quantifier commitment\nwhenever our theories imply existentially quantified statements. But\nexistential quantification, Azzouni insists, is not sufficient for\nontological commitment. After all, we often quantify over objects we\nhave no reason to believe exist, such as fictional entities.\nTo incur an ontological commitment\u2014that is, to be\ncommitted to the existence of a given object\u2014a criterion for\nwhat exists needs to be satisfied. There are, of course, various\npossible criteria for what exists (such as causal efficacy,\nobservability, possibility of detection, and so on). But the criterion\nAzzouni favors, and he takes it to be the one that has been\ncollectively adopted, is ontological independence (2004, p. 99). What\nexist are the things that are ontologically independent of our\nlinguistic practices and psychological processes. The point is that if\nwe have just made something up through our linguistic practices or\npsychological processes, there's no need for us to be committed to the\nexistence of the corresponding object. And typically, we would resist\nany such commitment.\nDo psychological processes themselves exist, according to the\nontologically independence criterion? It may be argued that most\npsychological processes do exist, at least those we undergo rather\nthan those we make up. After all, the motivation underlying the\nindependence criterion is that those things we just made up verbally\nor psychologically do not exist. Having a headache or believing that\nthere is a laptop computer in front of me now are psychological\nprocesses that I did not make up. Therefore, it seems that at least\nthese kinds of psychological processes do exist. In contrast,\nimaginings, desires, and hopes are processes we make up, and thus they\ndo not exist. However, the underlying motivation for the criterion\nseems to diverge, in these cases, from what is entailed by the\ncriterion's actual formulation. For the criterion insists on the\nontological independence of \u201cour linguistic practices and\npsychological processes\u201d. Since headaches and beliefs are\npsychological processes themselves, presumably they are not\nontologically independent of psychological processes. Hence, they do\nnot exist. This means that if the criterion is applied as stated, no\npsychological process exists. For similar reasons, novels, mental\ncontents, and institutions do not exist either, since they are all\nabstract objects dependent on our linguistic practices and\npsychological processes, according to the deflationary nominalist\n(Azzouni 2010a, 2012).\nQuine, of course, identifies quantifier and ontological\ncommitments, at least in the crucial case of the objects that are\nindispensable to our best theories of the world. Such objects are\nthose that cannot be eliminated through paraphrase and over which we\nhave to quantify when we regiment the relevant theories (using\nfirst-order logic). According to Quine's criterion, these are\nprecisely the objects we are ontologically committed to. Azzouni\ninsists that we should resist this identification. Even if the objects\nin our best theories are indispensable, even if we quantify over them,\nthis is not sufficient for us to be ontologically committed to\nthem. After all, the objects we quantify over might be\nontologically dependent on us\u2014on our linguistic\npractices or psychological processes\u2014and thus we might have just\nmade them up. But, in this case, clearly there is no reason to be\ncommitted to their existence. However, for those objects\nthat are ontologically independent of us, we are\ncommitted to their existence.\nAs it turns out, on Azzouni's view, mathematical objects are\nontologically dependent on our linguistic practices and psychological\nprocesses. And so, even though they may be indispensable to our best\ntheories of the world, we are not ontologically committed to\nthem. Hence, deflationary nominalism is indeed a form of\nnominalism.\nBut in what sense do mathematical objects depend on our linguistic\npractices and psychological processes? In the sense that the sheer\npostulation of certain principles is enough for mathematical practice:\n\u2018A mathematical subject with its accompanying posits can be\ncreated ex nihilo by simply writing down a set of axioms\u2019\n(Azzouni 2004, p. 127). The only additional constraint that sheer\npostulation has to meet, in practice, is that mathematicians should\nfind the resulting mathematics interesting. That is, the consequences\nthat follow from the relevant mathematical principles shouldn't be\nobvious, and they should be computationally tractable. Thus, given\nthat sheer postulation is (basically) enough in mathematics,\nmathematical objects have no epistemic burdens. Such objects, or\n\u2018posits\u2019, are called ultrathin (Azzouni 2004,\np. 127).\nThe same move that the deflationary nominalist makes to distinguish\nontological commitment from quantifier commitment is also used to\ndistinguish ontological commitment to Fs from asserting\nthe truth of \u2018There are Fs\u2019. Although\nmathematical theories used in science are (taken to be) true, this is\nnot sufficient to commit us to the existence of the objects these\ntheories are supposedly about. After all, according to the\ndeflationary nominalist, it may be true that there\nare Fs, but to be ontologically committed to Fs, a\ncriterion for what exists needs to be satisfied. As Azzouni points\nout:\n\nI take true mathematical statements as literally true; I\n  forgo attempts to show that such literally true mathematical\n  statements are not indispensable to empirical science, and\n  yet, nonetheless, I can describe mathematical terms as referring to\n  nothing at all. Without Quine's criterion to corrupt them,\n  existential statements are innocent of ontology. (Azzouni 2004,\n  pp. 4\u20135.)\n\nOn the deflationary nominalist picture, ontological commitment is\nnot signaled in any special way in natural (or even formal)\nlanguage. We just don't read off the ontological commitment of\nscientific doctrines (even if they were suitably regimented). After\nall, without Quine's criterion of ontological commitment, neither\nquantification over a given object (in a first-order language) nor\nformulation of true claims about such an object entails the existence\nof the latter.\nIn his 1994 book, Azzouni did not commit himself to nominalism, on\nthe grounds that nominalists typically require a reconstruction of\nmathematical language\u2014something that, as discussed above, is\nindeed the case with both mathematical fictionalism (Field 1989) and\nmodal structuralism (Hellman 1989). However, no such reconstruction\nwas implemented, or needed, in the proposal advanced by Azzouni\n(Azzouni 1994). The fact that mathematical objects play no role in how\nmathematical truths are known clearly expresses a nominalist\nattitude\u2014an attitude that Azzouni explicitly endorsed in\n(Azzouni 2004).\nThe deflationary nominalist proposal nicely expresses a view that\nshould be taken seriously. And as opposed to other versions of\nnominalism, it has the significant benefit of aiming to take\nmathematical discourse literally.\n",
