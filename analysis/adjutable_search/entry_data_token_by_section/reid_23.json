    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Moral Sense\n6.4 Moral Sense\n\n\nThe structure of a Reidian moral judgment resembles the structure of a\nReidian perceptual judgment, which is one of several important points\nof contact between his moral philosophy and his theory of\nperception. Reid attests to the depth and importance of these\nconnections (EAP 3.3.6). One fundamental implication of this\nstructural similarity reconfirms the point of the section about moral\njudgment above, namely, moral judgment is assertoric and not merely\naffective. Consider one's judgment about the person who assists the\nstranger who has fallen down. I do not directly perceive the agent's\ncharacter, though I do make a judgment about it. I directly perceive\nthe agent's action, and this functions as a sign that informs me about\nthe agent's character. Reid's theory of moral judgment shares so much\nstructure with his theory of perception\n(see 3. Perception and Knowledge of the World)\nthat many have written of Reid's \u2018theory of moral perception\u2019.\n\n \nThe moral sense operates in a fashion structurally similar to\nperception, but with an important difference. Moral feelings do not\noccupy a role parallel with sensations. Though sensations \u2018suggest\u2019\nperceptual judgments, moral feelings do not suggest moral\njudgments. Moral judgments are the basis of moral\nfeelings (Lehrer 1989, 225). Our moral conceptions,\nthough, are based upon moral feelings. Reid says, \u201cOur first\nmoral conceptions are probably got by attending cooly to the conduct\nof others, and observing what moves our approbation, what our\nindignation. These sentiments spring from our moral faculty as\nnaturally as the sensations of sweet and bitter from the faculty of\ntaste\u201d (EAP 5.2, 279).\n\n\nSince moral perceptions operate in the way our visual perceptions\noperate, Reid is able to claim that we can morally perceive things\nlike duty, even though duty, like visible figure, is a relational\nproperty. He says that \u201cDuty, or Moral Obligation\u201d is\nstrictly speaking neither a quality of an action nor a quality of an\nagent \u201cbut a certain relation between the one and the\nother. ... So that, if we seek the place of a moral obligation among\nthe categories, it belongs to the category of relation\u201d\n(EAP 3.3.5, 173). Though the object of my tactile perceptions is\na primary quality in a mind independent object, the object of my\nperception of a visible figure is a relation between the\nmind-independent object and my eyes. In this limited way, the\nperception of duty resembles the perception of visible\nfigures. Importantly, though, visible figures are themselves\nmind-independent, in just the way that duty is also\nmind-independent. Were someone else's eyes placed in the same location\nas mine are, she too would visually perceive just the visible figure I\nperceived. This intersubjectivity is important for grounding Reid's\nclaims about the perception of duty.\n",
