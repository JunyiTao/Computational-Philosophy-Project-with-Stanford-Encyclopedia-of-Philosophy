    "preamble": "\n\nFor Avicenna (Ibn S\u012bn\u0101) metaphysics is a science\n(\u02bfilm), i.e., a perfectly rationally established\ndiscipline that allows human reason to achieve an authentic\nunderstanding of the inner structure of the world. Metaphysics is the\nscience of being qua being and therefore the science that\nexplains every being. In his interpretation, Avicenna fuses\nthe Aristotelian tradition, which he intends to renew (Gutas 2014),\nwith the Neo-Platonic idea of emanation, on which he builds his\nsystem: metaphysics thus includes theology, cosmology and angelology,\nand provides a foundation for physics, psychology, prophetology and\neschatology. Indeed, metaphysics even demonstrates \u201cthe\nprinciples of the particular sciences\u201d that investigate\n\u201cthe states of particular existent things\u201d\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 2, 14, 18\u201315, 7) and are\nsubordinate to it (Bertolacci 2006: Ch. 7). So metaphysics is\n\u201cfirst\u201d and \u201cat the head\u201d of all sciences\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 3, 18, 14\u201317; Houser 1999;\nLizzini 2005) and is universal not only because it concerns being\nqua being (instead of just some aspects of it), but also\nbecause it comprehends reality\u2014and the system of knowledge this\nimplies\u2014as a whole (instead of just some portions of it).\n\nIn this article, which has reference mainly, but not exclusively, to\nthe Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t of Kit\u0101b\nal-\u0160if\u0101\u02be (known in English as the\nMetaphysics of the Book of the Healing or of the\nBook of the Cure), I shall start\u2014after introducing\nAvicenna\u2019s sources\u2014with a brief discussion of the status\nof metaphysics as a science, and then illustrate Avicenna\u2019s\nanalysis of existence and the theology that arises from it. Thereafter\nI shall focus on Avicenna\u2019s theory of emanation, highlighting\nits essential aspects.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Metaphysics: sources and importance\n\nAvicenna reads his main reference\u2014Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics\u2014in the light of two interrelated\ntraditions: that of the Late Ancient commentators (e.g., Alexander of\nAphrodisias, Themistius, Ammonius of Hermias) and that of the\nNeo-Platonic writings known in the Arabic world\u2014the so-called\nPlotiniana and Procliana\n arabica[1]\u2014part\n of which were ascribed to Aristotle himself. He consequently\nreinterprets Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics and gives an\noriginal structure to his own text (Bertolacci 2006: Ch. 5; Menn\n 2013).[2]\n The Arabic-Islamic traditions of philosophy and theology\n(Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn \u02bfAd\u012b, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, the\nKal\u0101m) are also essential to understanding Avicenna\u2019s\nmetaphysics: not only does Avicenna\u2019s terminology often depend\non his predecessors, but also some of the solutions he adopts are the\nresult of the ongoing discussion about their positions. Yet Avicenna\nsurpasses both his sources and his interlocutors. From a theoretical\npoint of view, his metaphysics is, in fact, incredibly rich and\nrefined. Many issues\u2014such as being and universality, the\nGod-world relationship, the problem of evil\u2014receive a quite\noriginal treatment in Avicenna\u2019s system. This clearly explains\nthe paramount importance Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics has for the\nhistory of philosophy, in both the West and the East. Indeed, thanks\nto the Toledo Latin version of the Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t of\nKit\u0101b al-\u0160if\u0101\u02be (Liber de\nphilosophia prima sive scientia divina), every Latin medieval\nphilosopher from the late 12th century onwards encountered\none or more of Avicenna\u2019s interpretations (Hasse and Bertolacci\n2011; Bertolacci 2013). In the East (and especially in the Persian\narea), Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics not only profoundly influenced\nphilosophy and theology, but also founded a centuries-old tradition\nwhich can be considered still extant (Endress 2006; Michot 1993;\nWisnovsky 2004, 2011, 2014). \n2. Metaphysics Between Ontology and Theology\n2.1 Ontology and Theology\n\nAvicenna\u2019s definition of metaphysics as a science is rooted in a\npremise he elaborates on the basis of Aristotle (Post.\nAnalytics I.10, 76b11\u201322) and al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\n(On the aims of the\n Metaphysics[3]):\n a science must have a subject-matter (upokeimenon:\nmaw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bf) and an object of research\n(zetoumenon: ma\u1e6dl\u016bb;\nmab\u1e25\u016b\u1e6f \u02bfan-hu). The former is assumed\nto be existent (it is a starting-point); the existence of the latter\nhas to be established, which is the purpose\n(\u0121ara\u1e0d) of the science or the aim towards which\nthe science is oriented (maq\u1e63\u016bd). From this\ndistinction a fundamental duality emerges: by virtue of its\nsubject-matter (the existent and its properties), metaphysics is\nconcerned with being and is ontology, whereas from the point of view\nof the question which it must answer, metaphysics establishes\n(i\u1e6fb\u0101t) the existence of the First Principle and\nis\n theology.[4]\n So Avicenna retains the theological conception that al-Kind\u012b\nhighlighted (and Aristotle himself\n suggested);[5]\n at the same time, he develops the line al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\ninitiated by positing being\u2014and not God\u2014as the focus of\nmetaphysics as a universal science (Bertolacci 2006: Ch. 2\u20133;\nMenn 2013). He thus gives his own solution to a traditional question\n(how should Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics be defined?): metaphysics\nfits the definition given in Gamma 1, 1003a20\u201326, as the science\nof being qua being or, literally, of the existent\nqua existent: al-maw\u01e7\u016bd bi-m\u0101 huwa\nmaw\u01e7\u016bd (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 1, 9, 8; 2,\n13, 12\u201313). It is only in terms of the question it must answer\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 1, 5, 13\u20137, 2; 9, 6\u201310;\n3, 19, 5\u20138; 21, 1\u20138; 23, 1\u20139), that the science of\nmetaphysics is \u201cdivine\u201d (al-\u02bfilm\nal-il\u0101h\u012b; cf. Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\nA.2, 982b28\u2013983a11; E.1, 1026a16\u201321) or \u201cof the\ndivine things\u201d (\u02bfilm al-il\u0101hiyy\u0101t; cf.\nMetaph., 1026a13\u201316), as the title of the metaphysical\nsections of Avicenna\u2019s philosophical summae\nindicate.\n2.2 The Meaning of the Dual Definition\n\nAvicenna\u2019s dual characterization of metaphysics results in a\nprofound connection between theology and ontology. Inasmuch as It\nexists, the First Principle partially coincides with the\nsubject-matter of metaphysics, so that theology is included in\nontology: the existence of God is part of existence\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 2, 14, 4\u201310: the Principle is\nthe Principle of part of being). The dual definition of metaphysics\nreflects a twofold way of considering existence or being itself: when\nit is taken as set apart from any condition, and hence taken to be\nabsolute, being is the subject-matter of metaphysical investigation.\nOn the contrary, when it is identified as the being of the Principle,\nit is necessarily defined as uncaused. In fact, the definition of\nmetaphysics as a science and its twofold denomination derive from a\nlogical-predicative distinction: being is either not on condition\nof (min \u0121ayr \u0161ar\u1e6d)\u2014and is hence\nan undetermined common being\u2014or is on condition of not\nand requires that (non-relational) predications be excluded. In more\ntechnical terms (analogous distinctions define quiddity and genus in\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t,V,1 and V,3) being is either not on\nthe condition of adding a determination (l\u0101\nbi-\u0161ar\u1e6di al-ziy\u0101da)\u2014and can therefore be\nunconditionally predicated of everything\u2014or is on the\ncondition of not adding a composition (ma\u02bfa\n\u0161ar\u1e6di l\u0101 ziy\u0101dati tark\u012bb;\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 2, 13, 8\u201313; VIII, 4, 347,\n10\u201316; Porro 2011b; Lizzini 2013). In the latter case, being\nconstitutes the divine being which is the research object of\nmetaphysics, i.e., the answer to the questions: does an uncaused\nprinciple exist? And if so, what are its properties? \n2.3 The Theological Vocation of Metaphysics: The First Principle as Absolute Cause\n\nAccording to Avicenna, metaphysics\u2014and no other\nscience\u2014can (and must) establish the existence of a First\nabsolute Principle. Physics, which deals with bodies and their\nmovement, can explain no more than motion (its result is, in fact, a\nPrime Mover) and, unable to answer the fundamental ontological\nquestion about the origin of the world\u2019s being, it\nsimply anticipates the idea of the Principle that metaphysics\ndemonstrates (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 1, 6, 17\u20137, 6;\nI,2,14\u2013end).\n\nFrom this perspective, Avicenna is not Aristotelian: metaphysics must\nexplain the transition from non-being to being, an atemporal\ntransition which does not exclude eternity from what is caused to be.\nHis idea is entirely consistent with Greco-Arabic Neo-Platonism: both\nthe pseudo-Theology of Aristotle (a re-elaboration of\nEnneads IV-VI) and the Book of the pure Good (a\nreworking of Proclus\u2019 Elements of Theology) insist on\nan originated being. At the same time, Avicenna includes in his system\nthe Aristotelian conception of a world eternally in movement: hence\nthe notions of matter, form, potency and act are elaborated so as to\nanswer the question of the origin of the world\u2019s eternal\nexistence. In keeping with Proclus (and against John\nPhiloponus\u2019s position: Davidison 1987; Chase 2012; McGinnis\n2012, 2013), Avicenna considers the world to be\n\u201cinstaured\u201d or absolutely created (mubda\u02bf)\nand at the same time establishes that it is eternal and eternally in\nmotion, as Aristotle\u2019s physics and metaphysics teach. He\ntherefore posits a Principle of the world\u2019s existence\n(wu\u01e7\u016bd) that does not correspond to the prime\nunmoved mover (cf. Commentaire Lambda: 7\u201312;\nTa\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t, 62, 14\u201319; Janssens 2003).\nIndeed, according to Avicenna, in metaphysics the efficient cause is a\ncause of existence (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VI, 1, 257,\n13\u201316). It is only in this sense that metaphysicians conceive\nthe Principle as an agent. At the same time, since It is first and\nperfect (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 4, 343, 12\u201315;\nVIII, 7, 368, 2\u20133; 369, 4\u20135; in some passages Avicenna\neven accepts the Neo-Platonic idea of the Principle above perfection:\nfawqa al-tam\u0101m: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IV, 3,\n186, 15; 188, 5\u201315; VIII, 6, 355, 9\u201310), the Principle\nmust also be a final cause (Wisnovsky 2003a: 180\u2013195). The idea\nof aim must then be (aporetically) shifted from the level of movement\nto that of being: the final cause is not a cause of movement but the\nsame efficient cause that makes things exist\n(m\u016b\u01e7id). The First Principle is therefore a cause\nin every respect (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 1, 4, 14\u201317;\nVIII, 3). The prime unmoved mover\u2014which is, in fact, the first\ncaused Intelligence\u2014justifies the movement of the world, but\nrefers in its turn to the Principle, which is absolutely First\n(McGinnis 2010a: 151; cf. Physics of \u201cThe\nHealing\u201d IV, 15).\n2.4 Univocacy of Being and Ontological Distinction\n\nThe dual definition (and notion) of both being and metaphysics reveals\nthe nuanced univocacy or univocity that rules both Avicenna\u2019s\nontology and his theology. If the uncaused Principle is itself\npart of being, then It is the principle of only part\nof being: of being insofar as it is caused, and not of all being or of\nbeing as such. Indeed, if the Principle were the principle of all\nbeing, it would, paradoxically, be Its own principle (while the\n\u201cFirst\u201d can be defined only as the being that Itself has\nno principle at all; the whole as such has no principle:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 2, 14, 1\u201316,20). Insofar as It\nis existent, the Principle is thus existent just as the world is.\nHence the ontological distinction between the uncaused Principle and\nIts effect does not lie in existence as such, but in one of its modes:\nthe uncaused Principle is necessary as regards existence,\nwhile everything else is always possible as regards\nexistence: i.e., it exists insofar as it is necessitated and\ntherefore necessary by virtue of something other. As a consequence,\nthe existence of things that are in themselves possible is always\nconceived as related to a (possible) essence, while\nthe being of the Principle is purely and necessarily existence:\ndespite a certain unavoidable ambiguity in Avicenna\u2019s language\n(see e.g., Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 7, 363, 1\u20132;\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 5, 349, 11: \u201cthe reality of\nthe First\u201d), the Necessarily Existent has no essence or no\nquiddity that differs from existence (anniyya:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 4, 344, 10\u201311; 346,\n8\u201312; cf. Macierowski 1988) and is in that respect beyond\nessence. The first attribute of the Principle is \u201cthat It is and\nthat It is existent\u201d (inn wa-maw\u01e7\u016bd;\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 7, 367, 12\u201313): existence is\nnot what It \u201chas\u201d: It simply is.\n\nThis nuanced univocacy of being has been variously determined:\nscholars have adopted locutions like per prius and per\nposterius (Menn 2013: 163\u2013167 on Categories, I,\n2), \u201cambiguity of being\u2019s univocity\u201d (Druart 2014),\n\u201cmodulated univocity\u201d (Treiger 2012) and gradual\npredication or predication according to an arrangement:\n\u201cgradueller oder ordnungsbezogener\nPr\u00e4dikationsmodus\u201d (Koutzarova 2009: 211\u2013258) or\neven \u201canalogy\u201d (De Haan 2015). Certainly Avicenna\nattributes existence both to the Principle and to things; he ascribes\nto existence differences in worth (Categories 10\u201311;\nBertolacci 2011: 43\u201344)\u2014there is in fact an evident\nhierarchy governing necessity and possibility (see\n Section 4.4);\n he modulates existence according to the absolute or relative\nnecessity it expresses, clearly excludes the possibility that\nexistence is a genus or that it is predicated equally\n(bi-l-tas\u0101w\u012b) of what is beneath it, openly speaks\nabout its anteriority and posteriority within the same pattern of\nreference to be found in Aristotle (health:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 34, 15\u201335, 2; other passages\nsuggest a different analogy; Menn 2013) and clearly establishes the\nstarting-point of theology in the analysis of the existent. Existence\nas such has no graduations but has modes or statutes\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VI, 3, 276,12\u201314) and hierarchy\nis ascribed to reality (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VI, 3,\n277,7\u2013278,8). The necessary cause is more worthy of reality than\nthe effect: the essence of the cause is not necessary in relation to\nthe effect, whereas the essence of the effect is necessary only in\nrelation to the cause. \n3. Essence and Existence\n3.1 The Existent as Primary\n\nThe first step in the analysis of the existent\n (al-maw\u01e7\u016bd)[6]\n is to acknowledge its absolute priority: the existent as such is\nindefinable (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 29, 5\u201331,9; cf.\nI, 2, 13, 8\u201313): everything implies the notion of the existent\nand cannot exist outside of it. In fact, whereas a definition serves\nto answer the question about the quiddity (m\u0101hiyya: what\nis it: m\u0101 huwa?) of a thing, the existent as such cannot\nhave a quiddity (one cannot investigate its m\u0101hiyya:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 2,13,\n 8\u201313).[7]\n In order to ask what a thing is, one cannot avoid referring to being,\nwhich is exactly what allows us to conceive all things, whether they\nare sensible, imaginary or intelligible, as existent. According to\nAvicenna\u2019s formula, which had a great impact on Thomas Aquinas\n(and on medieval Western philosophy in general), the existent\nis\u2014together with the thing, the necessary and the one\u2014one\nof the \u201cintentions\u201d (ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b;\nintentiones) that are \u201cimprinted in the soul in a primary\nway\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 29, 5\u20136; 30,\n3\u20134).\n\nThe primacy of being (everything that is conceived of\n\u201cis\u201d) leads to an often unseen consequence: everything\nthat is conceived of or simply mentally represented exists\nand hence has at least a mental existence (which means either\nintellectual or imaginary or estimative). Indeed, the existent as such\nis immaterial and only non-existence in the absolute sense does\n(obviously) not exist, since it cannot be either conceived or\ndiscussed (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 32, 6\u201316).\nNon-existent things are only relatively non-existent: resurrection,\ne.g., and possible and imaginary entities exist at least in the mind\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 33, 12\u201334, 9; cf. Arist.,\nMetaph., 1006b10). Impossible things seem to be non-existent\ninsofar as they are not properly conceived (intellectual existence is\ndistinct from imaginative existence: Michot 1987; Black 1997,\n1999).\n\nTogether with the distinction between mental and external existence\n(or existence in concrete individuals: f\u012b\nl-\u02bfay\u0101n) Avicenna posits a distinction between the\nbeing of the thing and its existence. Clearly, then,\nthe fundamental and primary character of being does not imply\nsimplicity: to exist means to be a given entity in\nthe world or\u2014as Avicenna also uses it\u2014a\n\u201cthing\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5). The\nexistence of something must thus be distinguished from its being what\nit is.\n\nIn Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5 Avicenna summarizes the meanings\nof the term maw\u01e7\u016bd (\u201cexistent\u201d) and of\nthe locutions that are related to it: \u201cthing\u201d\n (\u0161ay\u02be),[8]\n but also \u201cwhat\u201d (m\u0101), \u201cthat\u201d\n(alla\u1e0f\u012b), \u201cwhat is given\u201d or\n\u201crealized\u201d (al-mu\u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63al) and\n\u201cwhat is affirmed\u201d or \u201cestablished\u201d\n(al-mu\u1e6fbat). On the one hand, there are the existent\nand the thing as first notions: both indicate being as what cannot be\nknown through anything other than itself, so that knowledge is built\non it. On the other, there is what the word \u201cthing\u201d may\nalso indicate in every language: \u201cthe reality whereby every\nthing (amr) is what it is\u201d\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 31, 5\u20136; cf. VI, 5, 292,\n1\u20135). \n3.2 The Distinction Between Essence and Existence\n\nSo the analysis of being reveals two meanings of existence: the first\naffirms or establishes the existence of something; the second\nexpresses, without affirming its existence, the reality by\nvirtue of which something is what it is, namely, its essence.\nThe first is what Avicenna calls \u201cthe existence related to the\nfact that [something] is established\u201d (al-wu\u01e7\u016bd\nal-i\u1e6fb\u0101t\u012b), the second identifies the\n\u201cparticular\u201d or \u201cproper existence\u201d of the\nthing (al-wu\u01e7\u016bd al-\u1e2b\u0101\u1e63\u1e63). As\nregards the latter, one is either not required to know whether the\nthing is or is not existent or else one ignores the whole question. In\nthe first sense, then, the \u201cexistent\u201d (or\n\u201cexisting\u201d) thing stands for \u201cwhat is\nestablished\u201d (al-mu\u1e6fbat) or\n\u201crealized\u201d (al-mu\u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63al) and\naffirms that something exists; in the second sense, which is\nexpressed by \u201cproper existence\u201d, what is referred to is\nthe \u201creality\u201d (al-\u1e25aq\u012bqa),\n\u201cnature\u201d (al-\u1e6dab\u012b\u02bfa),\n\u201cessence\u201d (al-\u1e0f\u0101t) or\u2014according\nto Avicenna\u2019s technical terminology\u2014\u201cquiddity\u201d\n(m\u0101hiyya) or \u201cthingness\u201d\n(\u0161ay\u02beiyya) of the thing. Here no existential judgment\nis implied (one does not know if the thing exists); what is expressed\nis an intentional note, independent of its existence, which\nnecessarily accompanies it (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 31,\n1\u20139).\n\nThe background of this distinction is Aristotelian. In a very broad\nsense its origin can be discovered in Aristotle\u2019s Posterior\nAnalytics (II \u0392 92b10)\u2014where the question that asks\n\u201cif a thing exists\u201d is separate from the one that\nasks \u201cwhat a thing is\u201d\u2014in the\nMetaphysics (\u0394 V.5, 1015a20\u2013b15; 7,\n1017a7\u2013b10; but also \u0395 and Z)\u2014where the various\nmeanings of \u201cbeing\u201d are differentiated and the question of\nessence (ousia, to ti en einai) is posed\u2014and in De\ninterpretatione 11 21a25\u20138; Lizzini 2003; Menn 2013).\nMoreover, although original in its development Avicenna\u2019s\ndistinction uses terms and concepts that can be found in both the\nphilosophical and the theological traditions of classical Islam: in\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s Book of Letters (K.\nal-\u1e24ur\u016bf; cf. Menn 2008), in Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn\n\u02bfAd\u012b\u2019s discussion of natures (Rashed 2004; Benevich\n2018 and 2019; Janos 2020) and also in the distinctions of\nMu\u02bftazilite Kal\u0101m, in which a \u201cthing\u201d was\nconceived of as separate from existence (Jolivet 1984; Wisnovsky\n2003a).\n3.3 The Composition of Essence and Existence\n\nIf distinguishing between two areas of being\u2014i.e., existence,\nwhich can be either mental or real, and the proper existence of the\nthing, i.e., its essence, quiddity, thingness (see\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t I, 5 and VI, 2)\u2014can be read as\nlogical, its value is ontological, since the composition which is\nrecognized in things concerns their being. Indeed, not only must the\nconceptual constituents that define the being of something be\ndistinguished from the affirmation of its existence (as in\ngnoseology), but also the very essence of something must be\nmetaphysically distinguished from its existence. Essence is not, so to\nspeak, \u201contologically neutral\u201d. The essence or thingness\nof which Avicenna speaks is not simply the essence of the thing\nconsidered as such, regardless of its existence, but the thingness and\nhence the thing that, considered as such and regardless of its\nexistence, reveals exactly the character or modality that its own\nexistence has. If the analysis of a thing, i.e., of its quiddity or\nproper existence, does not inform me of its existence (by knowing what\na thing is, I do not necessarily know if it is), this is\nbecause a thing is in itself only possible: it can be either existent\nor non-existent, and since it is in itself possibly existent,\nit is in itself non-existent. On the contrary, if the\nanalysis of a thing\u2014i.e., of its quiddity or proper\nexistence\u2014were to inform me positively of its existence (by\nknowing what a thing is, I also know that it is), this would\nbe because a thing is in itself necessarily existent and therefore in\nitself existent (Lizzini 2003). Paradoxically, however, in the latter\ncase, the \u201cthing\u201d in question is only necessary existence,\nit has no quiddity (or no quiddity beyond its existence) and is not,\nproperly speaking, a \u201cthing\u201d (Bertolacci 2012a): in this\ncase, in fact, what is revealed is the existence of the Necessary\nPrinciple, which is pure existence on condition of not and\ncan therefore be conceived beyond essence and thingness.\n\nThe core of the distinction is that what is necessarily existent is\npurely existence (but not undetermined common existence) and is indeed\nthe Necessarily Existent Principle. Conversely, everything that does\nnot exist necessarily and therefore has a possible relation to\nexistence is something that is possible, so that in order to\nexist it always and necessarily refers to a cause that makes it exist:\na cause that justifies the fact that instead of being possible\n(mumkin) and therefore not already assigned to existence, the\nthing is qualified as existent. Non-determination to existence leads\nto non-existence (\u02bfadam, lays, laysa) and this is in\nfact what pertains to the thing in itself. Existence\u2014or more\nprecisely a determination of its relation to existence\u2014pertains\nto the thing because of something else (the cause). In this respect,\nnon-determination coincides with possibility, whereas determination\ncoincides with necessity per aliud. In ontology, the logical\nnotions of the possible and the necessary become the duo of what is\n\u201cnecessary in itself\u201d and what is \u201cnecessary by\nvirtue of another\u201d (Na\u01e7\u0101t: 547\u2013549;\nLizzini 2011: 116\u2013132).\n\nThe distinction between (or relation or composition of) quiddity and\nexistence is a fundamental issue of Avicenna\u2019s ontology. This\nholds too for the modal concepts that connote it in as much that\nquiddity could be said to refer to possibility, whereas existence\nwould be necessity. Although problematic (especially as regards mental\nexistence), it allows Avicenna to give an account of the so-called\n\u201contological difference\u201d between the uncaused Principle\nand the caused world: the First Principle is absolutely necessary and\nsimply coincides with, or more exactly, is Its own existence:\n\u201cthat is\u201d expresses a primary attribute of the Principle\n(all others are relations, either positive or negative:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 7, 367, 13\u201315; cf. 4, 343,\n13\u2013344, 5; 5, 354, 12\u201314), whereas in everything else\nthere is a duality. In every thing the distinction between\nwhat the thing is and the fact that it is is\ninevitable. Existence can consequently be said to be external to\nessence, so that an existing thing, whose essence or quiddity is\npossible, can be said to be composed of essence and\nexistence. Conversely, in that which is in itself necessary there is\nno need for such a composition (there is no essence: no being\nsomething, but only being). Necessity is an affirmation or more\nprecisely a confirmation of existence (ta\u02beakkud\nal-wu\u01e7\u016bd: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 36,\n4\u20135). The idea of a distinction/composition thus has a precise\ntheological function: not only does it distinguish everything from the\nNecessary Principle (everything except the Principle is\ntwofold: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 47,\n18\u201319); it also reveals the divine creative act: everything\nexcept the Principle receives (or obtains) existence\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 3, 342, 10;\nTa\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t, 175, 10\u2013176, 7). The\ndistinction also explains the derivation of celestial souls and bodies\nfrom supernal intelligences: in this respect emanation is nothing but\nthe exposition of the dialectic between necessary existence and\npossible essence, which together constitute the intelligences\u2019\nbeing. This same distinction between a possible essence and its\nnecessary existence can, finally, explain any causal relationship: a\ncause is ultimately nothing but that which allows the transition from\nthe possible to the necessary, or that which makes possibility incline\ntowards necessity. Certainly, a cause may, in its turn, be possible\nand so refer to a further cause, but every causal chain leads back to\nthe First Cause, which is in Itself necessary and one\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 1\u20133).\n3.4 Quiddity and Mental Existence\n\nNevertheless, composition is not the result of an addition. The\nquiddity or essence of a thing is not in its turn a\n\u201cthing\u201d with its own mental existence so that, once added\nto (real) existence, it could become a real thing (Lizzini 2014). This\nwould not only lead to infinite division (in the quiddity one would\nagain distinguish quiddity from existence), but also\u2014as Avicenna\nnotes\u2014to Platonism (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, V, 1, 204,\n4\u20135; cf. VII, 2\u20133; Marmura 2006; Porro 2002, 2011a). But\nhere lies the problem: the distinction between essence and existence\ncannot obviously lead to the conclusion that essence is simply\nnon-existent (no affirmative statement about the absolutely\nnon-existent is possible: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 32,\n12\u201313; cf. 15\u201316). What Avicenna states by distinguishing\nquiddity and existence in what exists either in the mind or in reality\nis that quiddity does not coincide with the existence of the thing:\nneither with its mental existence, which is related but does not\ncorrespond to universality, nor with its concrete existence\n(f\u012b l-\u02bfay\u0101n), which implies individuality. On\nthis point there are two fundamental if problematic sections of\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t (V 1\u20132) where Avicenna outlines the\nso-called theory of the \u201cindifference of essence\u201d: in\nitself quiddity is only quiddity (equinity is only equinity:\nfa-l-farasiyya f\u012b nafsi-h\u0101 farasiyya faqa\u1e6d\nor, according to the celebrated Latin formula, equinitas ergo in\nse est equinitas tantum). The same logical consideration\n(i\u02bftib\u0101r) that Avicenna applies to the existence of\nGod and existence in general serves here to explain the separation of\nquiddity from existence: the animal that is not on condition\nof something other is the animal in its reality or quiddity; it\ncan exist either in the mind or in the concrete world but\nonly if it is accompanied by some fulfilled conditions; the animal\non condition of not (i.e., of not being accompanied by any\nother), is the abstract form that results from a mental consideration\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, V, 1, 203, 15\u2013204, 13). Indeed,\nwhen it is considered either in intellectu or in re,\nquiddity is accompanied by existence and by the quantitative\ndetermination that belongs to it: it is then either universal or\nparticular, although in itself it is neither universal nor\nparticular and is nothing but quiddity. When it is considered with a\nquantitative determination, quiddity is thus no longer considered as\nit is in itself (Alexander of Aphrodisias\u2019\nQuaestiones I.3 and I.11 have been indicated as the source of\nthis distinction: Menn 2013; cf. de Libera 1999; Benevich 2019). Every\nintention (ma\u02bfn\u0101), that of universality\u2014which\nis the inherent non-impossibility of a multiple predication\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, V, 1, 195, 4\u2013196, 3)\u2014and\nthose of particularity or unity, accompanies quiddity in existence\n(mental or real); in Avicenna\u2019s technical terminology they are\nattributes (\u1e63if\u0101t) or necessary concomitants\n(law\u0101zim) of the quiddity of the thing, not identical\nwith it. Quiddity (e.g., equinity) is not the universal (of horse):\n\n\n\nthe universal (al-kull\u012b) insofar as it is universal, is\none thing, but insofar as it is something accompanied by universality,\nit is another thing. (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, V, 1, 196, 6;\nMarmura 1992, slightly modified; see also The Metaphysics of the\nHealing, 149)\n\n\nThe indifference of quiddity to any kind of determination truly\nestablishes the correspondence between reality and knowledge: it is\nexactly because quiddity is in itself neither real (i.e. extra-mental)\nnor mental that it can be present both in reality and in the mind,\naccompanied by the determinations of either individuality or\nuniversality: in concrete reality there is x in its particular\nexistence, while in the mind there is x with its possible multiple\npredication. In this respect, the consideration of quiddity\nin itself\u2014which corresponds to the thing in itself as expressed\nby its definition\u2014transcends both levels of existence (external\nand mental) and in one passage is equated to the \u201cdivine\nexistence\u201d (wu\u01e7\u016bd il\u0101h\u012b) of\nsomething that depends on God\u2019s providence\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, V, 1, 204, 16\u2013205, 4; for the\npossible reference to Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn \u02bfAd\u012b\u2019s\ndiscussion of Alexander\u2019s essentialism, see Rashed 2004; Menn\n2013; Benevich 2018, 2019; cf. Black 1999). Quiddity is in fact the\n\u2018reality\u2019 of the thing and is always identical to itself\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 31,2\u20139, 36,4\u20136).\nRecently scholars have analyzed the question of the reality and the\nbeing of quiddity from both a logical (Benevich 2018) and an\nontological perspective, highlighting the point that the discussion of\nthe universals plays a crucial role in understanding Avicenna\u2019s\ntheory of quiddity in itself (Janos 2020; cf. de Libera 1999; Marmura\n1992). The crux of the matter lies in the notion of mental existence.\nClearly through consideration one ascribes properties to\nquiddity and in that respect quiddity is existent or realised (see\ne.g. Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 32,12). Consideration\n(i\u02bftib\u0101r) should therefore be conceived as grantinga\nkind of existence, although not as a composition of essence\nandexistence (for the mereological interpretations of quiddity, see\nDeHaan 2014 ; Benevich 2018 ; Janos 2020). \n3.5 Ontology and Henology (Being and Oneness)\n\nClearly then, not only Avicenna\u2019s ontology but also his henology\nshould be understood in the light of the distinction between being and\nthing: the existent and the one are both primary indefinable concepts\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 30, 3\u20134) and necessary\nconcomitants of a thing (if a thing is, it is one), but being a thing\nis different from existing and being one: in itself the\nquiddity of a thing is neither existent nor one. Indeed, even unity is\nan attribute or a concomitant added to quiddity as it exists\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, V, 1, 200, 13\u2013201, 3; 201,\n8\u201313). So, while for Aristotle \u201cbeing\u201d and\n\u201cone\u201d are coextensive\u2014being one is a per se\nattribute of being\u2014(they are not identical in meaning, although\nAristotle presents this possibility: Metaph. 1003b25), for\nAvicenna being and one are per se attributes of a thing, so\nthat being and one are coextensive, although not identical in meaning,\nand this is so whenever we can speak of a \u201cthing\u201d (Druart\n2001; Wisnovsky 2003a, esp. 158\u201360) i.e., always excepting the\nPrinciple. Consequently there is the difficulty of conceiving\n\u201cone\u201d as both univocal and transcendental: being and being\none coincide only because they are both said of every category and do\nnot indicate a substance (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, III, 2, 103,\n7\u20139). Unity\u2014which is an accident in the category of\nquantity\u2014is indivisibility; it is said in terms of priority and\nposteriority\u2014with a certain ambiguity or modulation\n(bi-l-ta\u0161k\u012bk)\u2014of several things\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, III, 2, 97, 4\u20135; 99, 13\u201314;\nbut cf. Averroes on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics,\n39\u201342; Menn 2013) and cannot coincide with being because\notherwise multiplicity could not be (unity and\nmultiplicity\u2014which derives from unity\u2014cannot be opposite:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, III, 3, 104, 6\u20137; 6, 129,\n11\u2013130, 7).\n4. Modality and Existence\n4.1 Possibility and Necessity\n\nThe so-called distinction between essence and existence reveals an\nunavoidable modal characterization of being. The starting-point of\nAvicenna\u2019s metaphysics is the existent, but the analysis\nAvicenna applies to it (see Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 6) does\nnot concern what exists insofar as it is existent (the existent is\nindefinable: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 2, 13, 8\u201313), but\ninstead concerns the modality that explains the relation that\nwhat exists has to its own existence: an existent can be either\nnecessary in itself (\u1e0dar\u016br\u012b;\nw\u0101\u01e7ib: it is then also necessarily one) or possible\n(mumkin) in itself (this is the case of every existent with\nthe exception of the First Principle: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I,\n6, 37, 7\u201310). These distinctions thus reveal the inner complex\nof relations that explain existence: not only are the notions of\nexistent and thing primary, but so are those of unity, necessity\nand\u2014to some extent\u2014possibility\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 29, 5\u20136; 30, 3\u20134; 35,\n3\u20134; 36, 4\u20135). If, on the one hand, the primacy of these\nnotions ultimately leads to positing the transcendentals (de Libera\n1994; Aertsen 2008; Bertolacci 2008a; Koutzarova 2009), on the other\nhand they reveal that, in the world, being is always the being of\nsomething, so that the notions of existence (unity and\nnecessity), although separate from that of the thing, can never be\nisolated from the thing or from the relation that it has to existence\nitself. A crucial point is that the division between necessity and\npossibility regards something that exists. Avicenna speaks,\nin fact, precisely of what is \u201cnecessarily existent\u201d or of\nwhat is \u201cnecessary as far as existence is concerned\u201d\n(al-w\u0101\u01e7ib al-wu\u01e7\u016bd), and of what is\n\u201cpossibly existent\u201d or \u201cpossible as far as existence\nis concerned\u201d (al-mumkin al-wu\u01e7\u016bd). What is\nconsidered is the quiddity (m\u0101hiyya) or essence\n(\u1e0f\u0101t) of what exists: the modality of existence\ndepends, in fact, not on existence (which would be impossible), but on\nessence (although in the case of the Principle there is no essence\ndifferent from its own existence; see\n Section 2.4).\n\nNecessity (by virtue of another or in itself) defines the ways in\nwhich an existent exists: if an existent is necessary by\nvirtue of another and therefore in itself possible, it establishes a\nrelation \u2018of being caused\u2019 with something other than\nitself (its cause): it is precisely this relation that explains its\nexistence. If an existent is necessary in itself, there is no causal\nrelation at all (no cause). In this respect, possibility and necessity\nin existence are to be identified with the notion of need, dependence\nor link (the former) and with its negation (the latter;\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t I, 6). Consequently, what is possible is\nalways and inevitably an effect and answers the question why, while\nwhat exists necessarily does not refer to any cause and has no\n\u201cwhy\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 4, 348,\n5\u20136; cf.VIII, 1, 327, 12\u2013329,4). The Necessary Existent\nhas no cause (cf. Ta\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t, 80, 24\u201381,\n2). It has relations in so far as it is existent\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 3, 343, 16\u2013344, 5; cf.\nLizzini 2013).\n4.2 The Existence of the Necessary Principle\n\n\u201cConsidered in themselves\u201d (i\u1e0f\u0101\nu\u02bftubira bi-\u1e0f\u0101ti-hi), the things that find place\nin existence (al-um\u016br allat\u012b tad\u1e2bulu f\u012b\nl-wu\u01e7\u016bd) are subject to \u201ctwo divisions in the\nintellect\u201d: they are either \u201cnot necessarily\nexistent\u201d, and therefore possible, or \u201cnecessarily\nexistent\u201d (inherently impossible things do not exist and are\nexcluded from the analysis: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 6, 37,\n6\u201310).\n\nOn this basis, Avicenna deduces the properties of what is in itself\nnecessarily existent. The first is being uncaused. It is in fact\n\u201cevident\u201d (\u1e93\u0101hir:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 6, 38, 1) that the necessary has no\ncause: to have a cause means to exist by virtue of something else, and\nwhat exists by virtue of itself cannot exist by virtue of another, nor\ncan it exist by virtue of itself and at the same time not exist by\nvirtue of itself. The second property is uniqueness: the necessary has\nno \u201chomologue\u201d: there is nothing that\u2014even if\nequivalent to it as regards its definition\u2014could exist together\nwith it and thus occupy the same rank of existence, without being\neither its cause or its effect. Two necessary beings would in fact\neither both be caused (and therefore both non-necessary), or refer to\na cause that would make only one of them exist; but in the latter\ncase, they could no longer be defined as equivalent or homologous\n(mutak\u0101f\u012b al-wu\u01e7\u016bd): one would be\npossible and caused, while the other\u2014in the absence of another\nexternal cause\u2014would be its cause (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t,\nI, 6, 39, 17\u201342, 7). Indeed, as shown by the discussion of the\nrelations between form and matter (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t II,\n4), and also soul and body (see the psychological part of the Book\nof the Healing, the Kit\u0101b al-nafs;\nAvicenna\u2019s De anima, V, 4), the co-existence of two\nthings always implies the action of a cause that makes them exist\n(Lizzini 2004).\n\nOther properties (see Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7) are\nattributable to a being necessary in itself: unity, simplicity and\nthen non-relativity, immutability, non-multiplicity and\nnon-association with anything other than itself (these properties,\namong others, are discussed in terms of negative\nattributes\u2014\u1e63if\u0101t\u2014of the Principle in\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t VIII (4, 347, 10\u2013348, 6; 5, 354,\n9\u201314). The various and complex justifications Avicenna uses in\nthis respect are all reducible\u2014as he himself observes\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 46, 4\u20135)\u2014to a single\ngeneral line of argumentation, which shows that two supposed necessary\nbeings could not be distinguished one from the other: if they were to\nbe distinguished by virtue of an essential property, they would be\nessentially different and therefore both not necessarily existent in\nthemselves; if they were to be distinguished by virtue of an\naccidental property, they would imply the existence of an external\ncause and would be equally\u2014each of them\u2014not necessary\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 43, 4\u201346, 5; 46,\n6\u201347, 5).\n\nThe Necessarily Existent is therefore absolutely one, indivisible and\nunique (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 47, 6\u20139; cf. VIII,\n4, 5) and the properties of the possible are deducible as opposite to\nthese (e contrario) (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 47,\n10\u201319): the possible is caused and twofold\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 47, 18\u201319); in itself it\ndoes not exist and therefore always receives existence from something\nelse. The hypothesis of a possible existent thing, which can both\nexist and not exist, leads necessarily to positing a cause that makes\nit necessary (by virtue of another). If the possible were not rendered\nnecessary by its cause, but\u2014given the cause and its relationship\nto it\u2014were still possible, it would be continuously in a state\nin which it could exist and not exist. But since it exists (the\nanalysis concerns existing things), its relation to the cause must be\nnecessary. Analogously, if the cause were in its turn possible, it\nwould refer to a further cause that would explain the existence of\nboth the caused thing and its cause. If even this further cause were\npossible, it would perforce have recourse to a third one, and so on.\nOne could not proceed ad infinitum (as an Aristotelian,\nAvicenna accepts only a potentially infinite series of causes) and\ncould consequently not explain the actual existence of a thing: the\nthing would still be possible and therefore non-existent.\n\nThe arguments of Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t I, 6\u20137\u2014which\nare in part both reminiscent of and influential for those of the\nKal\u0101m (Rudolph 1997; Alper 2004)\u2014could be interpreted as an\nontological proof of God\u2019s existence (Hourani 1972; Morewedge\n1979; Marmura 1980; Davidson 1987), especially when seen in relation\nto an earlier passage of Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t I, where\nAvicenna attributes to metaphysics the power to establish the\nexistence (i\u1e6fb\u0101t) of God without recourse to sense\ndata (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t I, 3, 21). Undeniably, Avicenna\noffers here a description of the status of necessary existence and a\ndeduction of its properties.\n4.3 The Results of the Analysis\n\nIn sum, the analysis of the thinkability of existence demonstrates\nthat: \n\n existence and necessity are related or even coincident: every\nexistent is necessary, either per se or per aliud;\n\nby virtue of this correlation existents are divided into two\ngeneral categories: those that, considered in themselves require no\n(causal) connection with anything other than themselves, and those\nthat, as they do need a (causal) link with something other, are not\n(in themselves) necessary; \n independence and dependence on some other correspond respectively\nto the necessity and non-necessity of \u201cbeing\u201d or the\nexistent; \n everything that is not necessary in itself and is not made\nnecessary by something other, is possible as regards both existence\nand non-existence: as such, without a necessitating cause it does not\nexist; the possible is thus exactly what must establish a causal\nrelation as regards its own existence, which ultimately leads us back\nto a necessary and absolute cause; \nthe ontological field of what is in itself necessary can\ncomprehend only one being, simple and absolutely one and unique: the\nintellect can conceive of only one being whose existence is unrelated\nto a cause, while it conceives of things as multiple only by virtue of\na relation or a connection to a\n cause;[9]\n\nthe relationship between two things always implies a causal\nrelation (of two separate things, either one is the cause of the\nother, or both are caused by a third entity), which clearly shows the\nneed of a vertical causality (from a superior to an inferior level of\nbeing). \n\n\nThis general law governs Avicenna\u2019s emanative theory: it is\nalways a third and superior cause that accounts for two apparently\ncorrelated existing elements (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 39,\n16\u201342).\n4.4 The Kinds of Status of Existence\n\nThe significance of these determinations becomes clear if one\nconsiders the other kinds of status (a\u1e25k\u0101m:\nliterally \u201cjudgments, statutes, precepts\u201d) Avicenna\nassigns to existence in addition to necessity and possibility (which\nin Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t I, 1, 7, 16\u201319 are said to be\namong the proper accidents of being), namely priority and\nposteriority, on the one hand, and richness and\npoverty (or indigence), on the other\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VI, 3, 276, 13\u2013277,\n 3).[10]\n These determinations explain the distinction between essence and\nexistence (or \u201cproper\u201d and \u201caffirmative\u201d\nexistence) and are, in turn, clarified by the notions of\n\u201cnexus\u201d and \u201cneed\u201d. Indeed, what is necessary\nin itself is ontologically and axiologically prior to the\npossible because it is independent, whereas the possible is\nposterior precisely because it depends on a cause. Insofar as\nit is autonomous, the necessary is also rich, while the\npossible, which is posterior and secondary, is needy, poor or\nindigent. The necessary is \u201crich\u201d because it is\nindependent of any thing; the possible is \u201cpoor\u201d because\nit cannot exist without something else (i.e., without the cause). From\na theoretical point of view, these determinations immediately refer to\na causal relation that is either negated (by what is prior, rich and\nnecessary) or affirmed (by what is posterior, poor and possible). In\nother words, the determinations Avicenna calls the kinds of status of\nexistence serve to establish a clear distinction between a kind of\nexistence (i.e., one existent) that is necessarily uncaused and a kind\nof existence (i.e., of existent things) that is necessarily\n caused.[11]\n It is in fact in the light of the relationship between the absolute\nPrinciple and the world that they reveal their true significance. They\nhave an absolute or a relative meaning according to the causal\nrelation to which they refer. If the causal relation is relative and\nconsequently concerns secondary causes, these determinations are\nrelative, so that the cause is said to be necessary, prior and rich\nonly with respect to its effect, not in itself. If the relation is\nabsolute (if it refers to the First Cause), they are absolute: in this\ncase, the cause is necessary, prior and rich in itself.\n5. Causality and Cosmology\n5.1 The Causal Relationship\n\nThe causal chain is the key idea of the argument by means of which\nAvicenna, in Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t VIII, 1\u20133, posits a\nFirst Cause, in accordance with\u2014at least partly\u2014a\ncosmological scheme. Indeed, according to some scholars, this is the\nonly place to track down a demonstration of the existence of the\nPrinciple in the Metaphysics of the Book of the\nHealing (Bertolacci 2007; De Haan 2016). As an Aristotelian,\nAvicenna establishes formal, material, efficient and final causes.\nConsequently, in order to demonstrate the existence of a First\nabsolute Principle, he must show not only that \u201cfor every causal\norder there is a first principle\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t,\nVIII, 1, 327, 9) but also that causal chains are all based on the same\nFirst Principle. The demonstration of the finiteness of the agent\ncauses, from which every other series derives is an exemplar and\nserves as a general proof. Avicenna deduces the finiteness of all\nseries (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 1, 329, 5\u20139) from\nthe finiteness of an unqualified causal series: thus all series refer\nto a First Principle that is both an agent (\u02bfilla\nf\u0101\u02bfiliyya) and a final or completive (\u02bfilla\ntam\u0101miyya) cause (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t VIII,\n1\u20133; Wisnovsky 2003a).\n\nThis argument has a general premise: \u201cthe cause of the existence\nof a thing exists along with it\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t,\nVI, 2, 1, 264\u2013265, 5; VIII, 1, 327, 11); its structure is taken\ndirectly, and almost verbatim, from Aristotle. The causal\nchain is composed\u2014as in Metaph., \u03b1, 2, 994 a\n1\u201319\u2014of three elements: the cause\n(al-\u02bfilla), and then the effect (or what is caused:\nal-ma\u02bfl\u016bl) and the intermediary or medium\n(al-mutawassi\u1e6d), which both have a\n\u201crelationship\u201d to the cause \u201cthat consists in being\ncaused\u201d (nisba ma\u02bfl\u016blyya; see\n section 4.1).\n In a nutshell, the argument is simple: the existence of an effect\n(which is the cause of nothing) cannot be explained without evoking a\nFirst Cause; a cause that is cause and effect at the same time and\ntherefore a medium, would in turn refer to a cause: therefore, no\nmatter how many intermediate terms it includes, the series must always\nimply an absolutely First Cause: a cause that is a cause for each\nelement of the series and exists together with them.\n\nDefining the series on the basis of three elements (each with its own\nproperty: \u1e2b\u0101\u1e63\u1e63iyya), allows Avicenna\nto include the possibility of a multiplicity of intermediate terms\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 1, 327, 12\u2013328, 3). In a\nseries, in fact, the first term\u2014the absolute cause\u2014has the\nproperty of being the cause of all that is other than itself; however\nthe middle term, which is a cause for one part of the series and an\neffect for the other, may repeat this relation in a multiplicity if\nnot in an infinity of elements (in an eternal succession of causal\nrelations); the effect that is simply caused, finally, has the\nproperty of being the cause of nothing. This proves to be the pattern\nof a causal series as such; and this is so not only because any series\nhas its own first principle, but also because every causal series and\nthen every causal relation finally refers to a Principle that provides\nits foundation by transcending it: every causal series implies a First\nabsolute cause by which each of its elements is caused\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 1, 328, 4\u2013329, 4). A causal\nchain without a primum is therefore impossible; if it is\nposited, this occurs \u201conly through language\u201d\n(bi-l-lis\u0101n; lingua tantum). The true causal\nseries (i.e., the causes that always exist along with their\neffects) are themselves always finite (on infinity, see McGinnis\n2010b).\n5.2 The Causal Chain\n\nThese ideas\u2014the series, its vertical pattern, the distinction\nbetween internal and external causes and a transcendent principle of\nthe series\u2014are also elaborated in the Kit\u0101b\nal-I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t (see IV, 9\u201315; IV, 1\u20138 for\nits premises)\u2014 Remarks and Admonitions or\nPointers\u2014as the title of the work is known in English\n\u2014, a work of extreme importance for the Eastern philosophical\ntradition. The I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t argument has been\ndefined as a priori or ontological (Mayer 2001; cf. Marmura\n1980). It originates from the general consideration of \u201cevery\nexistent\u201d: once examined in their essence (min\n\u1e25ay\u1e6fu d\u0101ti-hi), or in isolation, without\nanything other than themselves, all existents either necessarily have\nor do not have existence in themselves: that which exists in itself is\nreal or true (al-\u1e25aqq), it necessarily exists\n(al-w\u0101\u01e7ib al-wu\u01e7\u016bd) and always subsists\n(al-qayy\u016bm: an Islamic theological term); that which\ndoes not have existence in itself is always in need of a connection to\nsomething other, namely a condition (\u0161ar\u1e6d) that\nwill accompany it, both when it is conceived as existent and when\nconceived as non-existent. Thus, conceiving a causal chain means\npositing the existence of something that is prior and external to it.\nIf the connection of the possible with something other than itself\nwere continuously repeated, ad infinitum, each unit in the\nchain would be possible in itself, and the collection\n(\u01e7umla) that the units constitute would also, in itself,\nbe unnecessary. In order to devise a collection of things, possible in\nthemselves but existing, one must conceive of a collection rendered\nnecessary by virtue of something external to it. The propensity to\nexist, which is necessity, is ascribed to the units of a collection,\nand hence to the collection itself, by something that, transcending\nit, is necessary in itself.\n\nThus Avicenna arrives at the idea of an absolute cause which is the\ncause of all things: the series, its units and the relations that bind\nthem to one another. One might posit the existence of something that\ncauses some units and not others, but this would certainly not be the\nabsolute cause, which is a cause that cannot be caused in any way. It\nis an extreme (\u1e6daraf) and therefore neither an\nintermediate element nor an effect. So, every chain (silsila)\nneeds a cause external to it: an extreme\u2014the Necessary Existent\nPrinciple\u2014which is not caused and therefore gives a foundation\nto the causal chain without being part of it. Indeed, in the\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t of Kit\u0101b\nal-\u0160if\u0101 Avicenna explicitly states that the flow of\nbeing is \u201cdistinct\u201d (mub\u0101yin) from the\nPrinciple (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 4, 403, 13).\n5.3 Absolute creation\n\nAccording to Avicenna the only way to conceive creation rationally is\nto conceive it as an ontological derivation outside of time. Hence the\nAristotelian model of eternity must be elaborated: the world can be\nboth eternal and created. It can, in fact, be continuously\n(d\u0101\u02beiman) brought into existence, without any\ninterruption or temporal precedence (it is possible and made eternally\nnecessary per aliud by its cause). In this manner Avicenna\nnot only develops Proclus\u2019 idea of an eternal effect, but also\nintegrates the theological concern for an absolute creation: indeed,\nhe intends to ascribe to the divine action the same absoluteness that\nthe idea of creation out of nothing is thought to imply. Using a\nterminology already applied by al-Kind\u012b and distinctly\nreminiscent of Neo-Platonic texts (Janssens 1997), Avicenna states\nthat the philosophers understand \u201ccreation\u201d\n(ibd\u0101\u02bf) as an act of bringing into existence that\ndoes not suppose a world preceded by non-existence (which would mean\nthat creation was placed in time), but nonetheless absolutely excludes\nthat same possibility of non-existence (Marmura 1984; Janssens 1987;\nLizzini 2011):\n\n\nThis is the meaning that philosophers\n(al-\u1e25ukam\u0101\u02be) term \u201cinstauration\u201d\n(ibd\u0101\u02bf): it is to make the thing be\n(ta\u02bey\u012bs al-\u0161ay\u02be) after an absolute\nnon-being (ba\u02bfda lays mu\u1e6dlaq). In fact, it belongs\nto the effect in itself to be non-being (lays),\nwhile because of its cause it belongs to it to be \u201cbeing\u201d\n(ays). And what belongs to the thing in itself is prior in\nthe mind (\u1e0fihn)\u2014as regards essence, not as\nregards time\u2014to that which is because of something\nother than itself. Here then each caused [thing] \u201cis\u201d\n(ays) after \u201cnot being\u201d (lays),\naccording to a posteriority in essence (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t,\nVI, 2, 266, 12\u201315).\n\n\nIt is precisely on the basis of the problematic identification of\npossibility and non-existence (here lays elsewhere also\n\u02bfadam: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 3, 342,\n6\u2013343, 6) that Avicenna shapes his idea of the divine flow in\nopposition to the theological conception of creation in time: for him\nnon-existence is what the possible in itself deserves. Reworking the\nAristotelian ideas of anteriority and agent causality, he ascribes to\nthe creation by the First Principle (with the consequent non-existence\nof the effect) not a temporal but an essential anteriority (Marmura\n1984). A non-existence that is prior in time would refute the\nabsoluteness of creation because it would, contradictorily, posit\nnon-existence. Moreover, this would explain a relative\ncreation\u2014a \u201ccertain causing to be\u201d\n(ta\u02bey\u012bs m\u0101)\u2014but not an absolute\ninstauration. The principle according to which Avicenna excludes time\nin the instaurative act of the First Principle is the same one that\nleads him to exclude any mediation: in order to be truly and\nabsolutely that which makes things existent, the First Principle must\nperform an act that is free of any mediation; as Avicenna states in\nthe Kit\u0101b al-I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t (Duny\u0101, III\nvol., 95), creation is not conceivable in terms of time because a time\nbefore the creative act of God would end up being an intermediate\nbetween the First Principle and the world:\n\n\nInstauration (ibd\u0101\u02bf) [signifies that] from the\nthing [is derived] existence for [something] other than it, which\ndepends on it alone, without an intermediary [such as] matter, or an\ninstrument or a time. On the contrary, what is preceded by a temporal\nnon-existence does not do without an intermediary. Instauration is of\na higher rank than generation (takw\u012bn) and than bringing\n[the thing] into being in time (i\u1e25d\u0101t).\n\n\nThe action of the First Cause must therefore be conceived as exempt\nfrom any mediation. Nothing (neither a matter, nor an act of will, nor\neven time) can be inserted between the Principle and Its effect (see\nalso \u1e24ud\u016bd: 42\u201343). An image often occurs in\nAvicenna\u2019s writings: the causality of the First Principle is\nsimilar to that of the hand that moves the key in the lock of a door:\nthe movement of the hand and that of the key\u2014respectively the\ncause and the effect\u2014are simultaneous, and yet one is prior to\nthe other. Priority is essential, not temporal\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IV, 1, 165).\n5.4 Emanation: Celestial Intelligences, Souls and Bodies\n\nAvicenna explains the creation of the world with an idea he adopted\nfrom Arabic Neo-Platonic writings: emanation, in Arabic\nfay\u1e0d (literally \u201cflow\u201d; cf. the Latin\nfluxus; Hasnawi 1990), which, like the Greek\naporrein originally indicated the flow of water from a\nsource. By virtue of an act of thought which is outside time and\ntotally auto-reflective\u2014the First Principle is Itself\nintelligence, as well as subject and object of intellection:\n\u02bfaql, \u02bf\u0101qil and ma\u02bfq\u016bl\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 6, 357, 3\u201312; cf. Arist.,\nMetaph., XII (\u039b) 7, 9)\u2014a thinking entity is\nderived from the First Principle: an intellect or intelligence\n(\u02bfaql) which is both the objectification of the\nintellection of the Principle and an active subject of thought. To the\nextent that is possible for a caused entity (which is in itself\nrelative), this first emanated intelligence is \u201cone\u201d\n(\u201cfrom the one, insofar as it is one, comes only one\u201d:\nex uno non fit nisi unum; Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX,\n4, 405, 13\u201314; cf. IX, 5, 411, 1, 5\u20136;\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t, III, ed. Duny\u0101, 95\u2013102;\ncf. Ta\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t, 97, 12\u201313). Nevertheless,\nunlike the Principle, which is absolutely simple, this first caused\nintelligence is already a complex existence. The reason for its\nexistence lies in fact not only in itself\u2014as in the case of the\nFirst Principle\u2014but in itself (in its possibility) and in the\nFirst Principle\u2019s act of thinking, which makes it necessary:\nthis first created intelligence is therefore twofold.\n\nIndeed the intrinsic duality of the first caused intelligence exhibits\nboth the structure of the universe (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I,\n7, 47, 18\u201319) and, at the same time, the reason the universe\nunfolds: if the First Principle\u2019s thought can only be simple and\nauto-reflective, that of the first caused intelligence is already a\ncomplex thought. This first caused intelligence has not only two\npossible objects of thought (its Principle and itself); it also has a\nthought of itself, which is in turn complex: it reflects the duality\nof its own being, in which essence and existence (and therefore\npossibility and necessity) are to be distinguished. Hence the first\ncaused intelligence thinks of the First Principle and then proceeds in\nits auto-intellection according to a descent which, as in a mirror,\nreflects (thus showing it in reverse), the ontological order of\ncausality: the intelligence thinks first of all of its existence or\nactualization (its necessity per aliud) and then recognizes\nits potential foundation (its essence as possible). The effect of this\narticulation is consequently triple (\u201cfrom every intelligence\nthree things follow\u201d: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 4, 406\n11\u201315): \n\nfrom the act by which the first caused intelligence thinks of the\nFirst Principle and aims at it, a further intelligence originates;\nfrom the act by which it thinks of itself and aims at itself, two\nentities originate: \na soul, which is an intelligence bound to a body and which is, in\nsome texts, equated to the practical intellect\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2, 387, 4\u20137); and \nthe celestial body to which this intelligence is bound.\n\n\nClearly, the consequence of the immediacy of the divine act is the\nnecessity of the series: only one caused element can derive directly\nfrom the absolutely unique Principle. Multiplicity is produced by\nmediation and the product of divine causality is divided between what\nis created directly (and is necessarily one) and what is created by\nway of mediation. With his emanative doctrine, Avicenna thus maintains\nthe idea of the absolute causation of being and simultaneously\nestablishes two distinct kinds of effects: those that correspond to\nthe intermediate (mutawassi\u1e6d), which is caused without\nmediation, and those that are like the last caused thing\n(ma\u02bfl\u016bl), which is caused by virtue of the\nintermediate and is only an effect. In Avicenna\u2019s emanative\nscheme, the first effects correspond to the celestial entities (and,\nstrictly speaking, only to the first one, which is caused or\n\u201cinstaured\u201d or absolutely created: al-mubda\u02bf\nal-awwal); the following ones are, roughly speaking, all the\neffects (and, strictly speaking, the sublunary effects).\n\nThis pattern also explains the relations among the different causal\nseries: as is the case in the Neo-Platonic tradition Avicenna divides\nthe four Aristotelian causes into internal and external as regards the\nthing of which they are causes (Jolivet 1991; Bertolacci 2002;\nWisnovsky 2003b); thus he inserts them in a hierarchy\n(cause-intermediate-caused) that places the intermediate term above\nthe last effect, but below the absolute cause. In the sublunary world,\nfor example, the form is part of the cause of matter and is superior\nto it, because it is an intermediate in the causal relation that binds\nmatter (the last caused thing) to the intelligence\u2014the dator\nformarum\u2014 from which both form and matter result\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, II, 4, 87, 13\u201389, 15; VI, 1, 259,\n7\u201310). Moreover, the effects that are caused without mediation\nare absolutely created (or \u201cinstaured\u201d) and immaterial and\nconsequently defined only by the ontological composition of the\npossibility of their essence and the necessity of their existence;\nthose that are caused by virtue of a mediation are defined by virtue\nof their ontological composition (possibility and necessity; existence\ndistinct from essence), but also by virtue of the composition that is\nconsequent to the mediation: they are material entities, composed of\nmatter and form. In this sense the whole of the cosmos is explained:\nthe intelligences (al-\u02bfuq\u016bl) that are caused\ndirectly by the Necessarily Existent (properly speaking only the first\nof them); the entities originated by virtue of the intellection of the\nfirst intelligences: the souls (al-nuf\u016bs) and the\nheavenly bodies (al-a\u01e7r\u0101m al-sam\u0101wiyya). Both\nof these have an influence on the sublunary world and\u2014like the\ncelestial intelligences\u2014are sometimes called\n\u201cangels\u201d in religious terms (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t,\nX, 1); they are followed by the world of simple effects: the beings of\nthe sublunary world. \n\nIndeed the intellectual process is welded to cosmology (in which the\nPtolemaic system is painstakingly harmonized with Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, Book \u039b and De Caelo). The whole\nof the heavens is explained in terms of emanation or flow. In some\ntexts, Avicenna mentions \u201cten intelligences after the\nFirst\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 3, 401, 9\u201312):\nthe Heavens\u2014the outermost orb, and the orb of the fixed stars,\nand then Saturn, and so on, up to and including, according to the\ntraditional scheme, the animated spheres of Jupiter, Mars, the Sun,\nVenus, Mercury and the Moon\u2014are bound to the intelligences. The\nearth is at the center. Theology, metaphysics, cosmology and\n(celestial) noetic seem fused with one another.\n\nThe noetic process also explains the multiplicity of intelligibles:\nthe Aristotelian idea of the First Principle as noesis\nnoeseos is interpreted by means of Themistius\u2019 idea of Its\nknowing all things through Itself (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII,\n6, 359, 15\u2013360, 10; Commentaire Lambda: 13; Pines 1987;\nBertolacci 2006), but in the Principle\u2019s thinking the multiple\nis intellected as a \u201cwhole\u201d and \u201cat once\u201d and\nappears to be reduced to something unique (to one\nintelligible). Thus, its order (tart\u012bb), the syllogistic\nconcatenation of intellection that corresponds to reality, is a\nconsequent of divine intellection and is in a sense relocated from the\nthought of the First Principle to that of its immediate effects\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 7, 362, 17\u2013366). \n5.5 Celestial Movement\n\nThe explanation of celestial movement elaborates and alters some of\nAristotle\u2019s (and al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s) ideas.\nIntelligences and souls together explain\u2014as remote and proximate\ncauses respectively\u2014the motion of the spheres, as they are at\nthe root of the influence (ta\u02bea\u1e6f\u1e6fur ) the\nspheres have on the sublunary world. Metaphysics explains\ncosmology\u2014to which it is linked\u2014but also adopts its data.\nThus the circular movement of the spheres is explained by Avicenna not\ndirectly by means of nature\u2014celestial bodies always leave the\nspot they have just attained only to return to occupy it again later,\nwhereas through natural movement a body should come to rest in its\nlocus naturalis\u2014but by means of a principle which is\nboth intellectual and psychic (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2,\n382, 8\u2013383, 13): the motion of the spheres is a reflection of\nthe love and desire (\u02bfi\u0161q and\nta\u0161awwuq; Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2, 387,\n1\u2013392, 3), common to both intelligences and souls, to resemble\ntheir principle (to realize their\nassimilation\u2014ta\u0161abbuh\u2014to it). It is\nbecause of this desired resemblance that celestial bodies actualize,\nby occupying all their possible positions in turn, the only\npotentiality they have (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2, 389,\n13\u2013390, 8; Hasnawi 1984; Janos 2011). In other words, celestial\nsouls continuously move the bodies to which they are bound in order to\nrealize this resemblance: each time they have before them the\nrepresentation of a point they must reach by virtue of which\nimperfection will, however briefly, be eliminated; in a way that is in\npart irrational, each time every soul chooses one point rather than\nanother (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2, 383, 10\u201311).\n\nThe movement of the spheres is thus explained by combining nature,\nsoul and intelligence. Indeed, the soul follows nature\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2, 383, 7\u201313; in a sense,\nsince it is not opposed to the potentiality of the body, celestial\nmotion could be defined as natural), but is also thought and will.\nOnly an intellectual discursive will, which is capable of a particular\nintellection, can explain the celestial movement by which the body is\nalways located in a particularly determined position: the soul\nconceives and therefore elects and desires a movement whose status (to\nleave a point in order to return to it and then leave it again as in a\ncycle) is rightly expressed by a paradox: celestial movement is\n\u201cpersistence itself\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 3,\n398, 2\u20137). In fact, intelligences guarantee the infinity of\nmotion because their thought is oriented towards the Principle; every\nintelligence moves because it looks to the Principle as to its object\nof love and assimilation and consequently receives from It an infinite\nlight (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2, 389, 10\u201313),\nwhile\u2014as we have observed (see\n Section 2.3)\u2014the\n First Principle is not a direct but a transcendent principle of\nmotion: it is the ultimate horizon to which the intelligences look\nwith their desire for resemblance.\n6. Conclusion\n6.1 The Ethical Dimension\n\nThe attribution of intellection and hence awareness to the Necessarily\nExistent (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 7, 368, 6;\nTa\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t, 50, 23\u201352) allows Avicenna to\nconnote the divine act in an ethical sense: according to Avicenna the\nflow explains the procession of being from the Principle\u2014also\ncalled the Pure Good (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 3, 394,\n4)\u2014in different terms from those used of natural necessity\n(which is explicitly rejected together with its typical image of\nlight: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 7, 363, 10\u201313). The\natemporal act \u201cat one blow\u201d (duf\u02bfatan\nw\u0101\u1e25idatan) of divine intellection\u2014according to\nthe formula already present in the pseudo-Theology of\nAristotle\u2014is interpreted as an act of will\n(ir\u0101da) and love (\u02bfi\u0161q). The First\nNecessarily Existent \u201ccreates\u201d the world, because, having\nintellection of Itself, It comprehends, intends, wants and loves Its\nown intellection and the consequences that this entails\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 7, 363, 14\u201317; 366,\n8\u201317; Commentaire Lambda: 15, 23\u201324). Will and\nlove\u2014which Avicenna includes among the attributes of the\nPrinciple (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 7, 366, 6\u20138; 370,\n7)\u2014explain the flow revealing its ethical dimension\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 7, 367, 7\u201311). The flow is\nthe good (\u1e2bayr) and generosity (\u01e7\u016bd)\nand gives the world, or lets it acquire the good: indeed, the flow is\ngood for the world, as it is generosity in itself (Lizzini 2005). Even\nevil (defined as non-existence or privation) is an object of divine\nwill: it is willed accidentally, i.e., insofar as it is a necessary\nconsequent of the good (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 6; Steel\n2002). Will is also ascribed to the First Principle in terms of\nlogical possibility: the Principle always wills (there is no time\nlag), but It could nevertheless have not willed to create\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IV, 2, 172, 13\u2013173, 12). The very\nrejection of the temporal dimension which would allow an authentic\nconception of creatio ex nihilo, is also the condition of a\ntrue conception of the divine will, a will that coincides totally with\nthe being of the Principle and aims at a good inherent in It, from\nwhich the good of the world follows as a consequence. The flow is\nindeed a communication or donation of existence: it explains the\nnecessity per aliud of possible essences and, as a donation,\nconnotes, in an ethical sense, the divine act (Lizzini 2011). At the\nsame time, the definition of absolute good as the full realization of\npossibility is the very basis on which Avicenna ascribes an ethical\ndimension to the action of the First Principle; and this comes not\nwithout difficulty: it entails the First Principle\u2019s having to\ncreate the world, because the realization of possibilities would be\ngood (Lizzini 2014).\n6.2 The Sublunary World: Matter and Evil\n\nWithout Avicenna\u2019s attempting to provide a philosophical reason\nfor it (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 4, 407, 4\u20138;\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t, ed. Duny\u0101, III, 228\u2013230),\nthe last intelligence does not lead to a further intelligence but\ninstead looks after the sublunary world and human beings. Indeed, the\nlast intelligence provides forms for the sublunary world.\nCalled\u2014with an expression that was to be in great favor in the\nLatin medieval world (which came to know it also through\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b) \u201cbestower\u201d or \u201cgiver of\nforms\u201d (dator formarum; Arabic: w\u0101hib\nal-\u1e63uwar; but, for Avicenna, this name can be applied to\nall intelligences: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 5, 411; 413), the\nlast Intelligence or Agent Intellect (al-\u02bfaql\nal-fa\u02bf\u02bf\u0101l) represents the principle of the\nphysical constitution of the world as well as the founding principle\nof human intellection (which at least in some texts Avicenna explains\nthrough the idea of donation). In general terms, the sublunary world\nis explained by means of the metaphysical structures used by\nAristotle: matter and form, potentiality and act. These structures are\nnevertheless sustained by the emanative pattern which explains the\nworld not only as regards its origin, but also as regards its\n\u201clife\u201d: generations and natural transformations are\nconceived as the result of a process by which matter becomes\nspecifically prepared to receive the gift of forms from above. So to\nthe active donation of forms by the Agent Intellect, Avicenna adds the\ninfluence of the spheres, the mutual interactions of the sublunary\nelements as preparatory causes and the reception of matter. The\ndynamic ideas of potency and act are thus elaborated and complicated:\nthe idea of potency\u2014quwwa\u2014to which Avicenna adds\nthose of preparation (isti\u02bfd\u0101d) and specific or\nproper preparation (isti\u02bfd\u0101d\n\u1e2b\u0101\u1e63\u1e63)\u2014is interpreted in the light of\nemanation: the potency of matter is reception in time and is in fact\npossibility in time. In the temporal dimension of the sublunary\nworld\u2014where what becomes is something after not having been it,\npossibility requires a substratum (matter) and becomes material\npotency: it thus explains a non-eternal thing, which is brought into\nexistence \u201cafter being non-existent\u201d\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IV, 2, 181, 7\u201312).\n6.3 Concluding Remarks\n\nHence, through the concept of emanation, Avicenna explains the\nGod-world relationship and, more generally, efficient causality. The\ncausality of motion (ta\u1e25r\u012bk) and of influence\n(ta\u02bea\u1e6f\u1e6fur) are both added to and subsumed\nunder the causality of emanation, which is sustained by the ideas of\nboth donation and reception. With his metaphysics Avicenna provides a\nfoundation for every level of his theory: physics and then psychology,\ngnoseology or epistemology, prophecy (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, X,\n2\u20133) and even eschatology (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 7;\nMichot 1986) find their ultimate explanation in the metaphysical\nconcept of the flow of forms. Consequently, if the\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t of the Kit\u0101b\nal-\u0160if\u0101\u02be and the metaphysical parts of the other\nsummae (Salvation, Remarks, Science, Guidance)\ntogether with the Kit\u0101b al-Ta\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t\n(The Book of Notes) and other writings like the\nKit\u0101b al-Mabda\u02be wa-l-ma\u02bf\u0101d (The Book of\nProvenance and Destination), are essential to the study of\nmetaphysics, it is no exaggeration to state that every work Avicenna\ndevoted to philosophy can be relevant to the understanding of his\nmetaphysical ideas and that metaphysical works clarify the other parts\nof Avicenna\u2019s system: metaphysics is omni-comprehensive.\n",
