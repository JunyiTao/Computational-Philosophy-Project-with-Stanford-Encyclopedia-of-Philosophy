    "main_text": "Classical Theories of the Doctrine of Atonement || The Ransom Theory\n4.1 The Ransom Theory\n\nThe ransom theory was widespread in the first few centuries of\n Christianity.[31]\n Versions of it can be found in the Latin (Augustine, On the\nTrinity, books IV and XIII), Greek (Gregory of Nyssa, An\nAddress on Religious Instruction), and Syriac (Narsai,\n\u201cHomily for the Great Sunday of the Resurrection\u201d) Church\nfathers. It is an instance of a broader family of views: Christus\nVictor. Gregory Boyd, a defender of a Christus Victor account, says\nthat the \u201cessence\u201d of the view is that God breaks\n\n\ninto human history to destroy the power of sin and rescu[e] us from\nthe cosmic powers that keep us in bondage to sin. (2006: 29)\n\n\nViews differ over how to depict the cosmic powers, the nature of human\nbondage to them, and the mechanism by which God frees humans from\nbondage through the work of Christ. The ransom account fills in these\ndetails in a distinctive and memorable way, although today it is\nrarely defended (for a notable exception, see Lombardo 2013).\n\nThe ransom view is built on a drama between God, Satan and humans.\nHumans sin, and as a result fall under the power of Satan, who in his\nrole as accuser rightly subjects humans to death. God, in his love,\ndoes not desire humans to endure eternal death, but it would be unjust\nfor God to simply remove us from Satan\u2019s power as he rightly\ncondemns us to death. To solve this problem, God sends\nChrist\u2014the son of God, the second person of the\nTrinity\u2014who has both a human and divine nature. Christ is not\nguilty of sin, but Satan brings about his death anyway, which then\nfunctions as a ransom: Satan owes God for this injustice and God, in\nreturn, frees humans from Satan\u2019s\n power.[32]\n\nStated as baldly as this, the ransom theory faces several objections.\nFirst, Anselm objects that God has the right and power to simply\nremove humans from Satan\u2019s power; it would be better to do that\nthan to send God the Son to die unjustly (CDH I.6). Second,\nAnselm argues that Satan has no right to treat humans as he does. All\nare subject to God\u2019s authority and Satan would not be wronged if\nGod removed humans from his influence (CDH I.7). However, it\nshould be noted that there are ransom accounts that do not assume that\nSatan has rights over humans\u2014for instance, Irenaeus holds that\nGod submits to what Satan desires not because Satan has a right to a\nransom, but because it is more fitting for God to act through\npersuasion than force (AH V.1.1).\n\nThird, the ransom theory treats humans like mostly innocent and\nhapless beings who have been tricked and enslaved by a foreign power\n(Ray 1998). Although this idea is present in the New Testament, it\nisn\u2019t clearly connected to atonement, which concerns a torn\nrelationship due to\n sin.[33]\n\nThe ransom theory isn\u2019t typically stated so baldly, however.\nOther motifs are used in concert with the notion of ransom, and some\nof these motifs can help address some of the above objections\n(although the motifs each raise their own problems as well). In the\nnext section we survey some of these motifs, as they are in principle\nseparable from the ransom theory, and have been used as elements of\nother accounts of atonement.\n",
