In January\n1689, following the Glorious Revolution at the end of 1688, he was\nelected to represent Cambridge University in the Convention\nParliament, which he did until January 1690. During this time he\nformed friendships with John Locke and Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, and\nin the summer of 1689 he finally met Christiaan Huygens face to face\nfor two extended discussions. Perhaps because of disappointment with\nHuygens not being convinced by the argument for universal gravity, in\nthe early 1690s Newton initiated a radical rewriting of the\nPrincipia. During these same years he wrote (but withheld)\nhis principal treatise in alchemy, Praxis; he corresponded\nwith Richard Bentley on religion and allowed Locke to read some of his\nwritings on the subject; he once again entered into an effort to put\nhis work on the calculus in a form suitable for publication; and he\ncarried out experiments on diffraction with the intent of completing\nhis Opticks, only to withhold the manuscript from publication\nbecause of dissatisfaction with its treatment of diffraction. The\nradical revision of the Principia became abandoned by 1693,\nduring the middle of which Newton suffered, by his own testimony, what\nin more recent times would be called a nervous breakdown. In the two\nyears following his recovery that autumn, he continued his experiments\nin chymistry and he put substantial effort into trying to refine and\nextend the gravity-based theory of the lunar orbit in the\nPrincipia, but with less success than he had hoped.\n\n\nThroughout these years Newton showed interest in a position of\nsignificance in London, but again with less success than he had hoped\nuntil he accepted the relatively minor position of Warden of the Mint\nin early 1696, a position he held until he became Master of the Mint at\nthe end of 1699. He again represented Cambridge University in\nParliament for 16 months, beginning in 1701, the year in which he\nresigned his Fellowship at Trinity College and the Lucasian\nProfessorship. He was elected President of the Royal Society in\n1703 and was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705.\n",
