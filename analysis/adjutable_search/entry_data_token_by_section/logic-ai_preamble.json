    "main_text": "\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence (referred to hereafter by its nickname,\n\u201cAI\u201d) is the subfield of Computer Science devoted to developing\nprograms that enable computers to display behavior that can (broadly)\nbe characterized as\n intelligent.[1]\n Most research in AI is devoted to\nfairly narrow applications, such as planning or speech-to-speech\ntranslation in limited, well defined task domains. But substantial\ninterest remains in the long-range goal of building generally\nintelligent, autonomous\n agents,[2]\n even if the goal of fully human-like intelligence is elusive and\nis seldom pursued explicitly and as such.\n\n\nThroughout its relatively short history, AI has been heavily\ninfluenced by logical ideas. AI has drawn on many research\nmethodologies:  the value and relative importance of logical formalisms\nis questioned by some leading practitioners, and has been debated in\nthe literature from time to\n time.[3]\n But most members of the AI community\nwould agree that logic has an important role to play in at least some\ncentral areas of AI research, and an influential minority considers\nlogic to be the most important factor in enabling strategic,\nfundamental advances.\n\n\nThe relations between AI and philosophical logic are part of a\nlarger story. It is hard to find a major philosophical theme that\ndoesn\u2019t become entangled with issues having to do with reasoning.\nImplicatures, for instance, have to correspond to inferences that can\nbe carried out by a rational interpreter of discourse. Whatever\ncausality is, causal relations should be inferrable in everyday common\nsense settings. Whatever belief is, it should be possible for rational\nagents to make plausible inferences about the beliefs of other agents.\nThe goals and standing constraints that inform a rational agent\u2019s\nbehavior must permit the formation of reasonable plans.\n\n\nIn each of these cases, compatibility with an acceptable account of\nthe relevant reasoning is essential for a successful philosophical\ntheory. But the methods in the contemporary philosophical inventory are\ntoo crude to provide anything like an adequate account of reasoning\nthat is this complex and this entangled in broad world knowledge.\n\n\nBringing an eclectic set of conceptual tools to the problem of\nidealized reasoning in realistic settings, and using computers to model\nand test the theories, research in AI has transformed the study of\nreasoning\u2014especially of practical, common sense reasoning. This\nprocess and its outcome is well documented in\n Russell & Norvig 2010.\n\n\nThe new insights and theories that have emerged from AI are of great\npotential value in informing and constraining many areas of\nphilosophical inquiry. The special case of philosophical logic that\nforms the theme of this article may provide support for the more\ngeneral point. Although logic in AI grew out of philosophical logic,\nin its new setting it has produced new theories and ambitious programs\nthat would not have been possible outside of a community devoted to\nbuilding full-scale computational models of rational agency.\n\n\nThis entry assumes an audience consisting primarily of\nphilosophers who have little or no familiarity with AI. The\nentry concentrates on the issues that arise when\nlogic is used in understanding problems in intelligent reasoning and\nguiding the design of mechanized reasoning systems. Logic in AI is by\nnow a very large and not very well demarcated field\u2014nothing\nlike complete coverage has been achieved here. \n Sections 3\n and\n Section 4\n provide an overview with some historical and\ntechnical details concerning nonmonotonic logic and reasoning about\naction and change, a topic that is not only central in AI but that\nshould be of considerable interest to philosophers. The remaining\nsections provide brief and more or less inadequate sketches of\nselected topics, with references to the primary literature.\n\nMinker 2000b is a comprehensive\ncollection of survey papers and original contributions to the field of\nlogic-based AI, with extensive references to the literature.  Jack Minker\u2019s\nintroduction, Minker 2000a, is a useful\norientation to the field. This volume is \na good beginning point for readers who wish to pursue this topic\nfurther.  Brachman\n& Levesque 2004a provides an introduction to the field of\nknowledge representation in textbook form.  \nDavis 1991a and\nMueller 2006a are book-length treatments\nof the challenging problem of formalizing commonsense reasoning.  \nAntonelli 2012a is a good entry point\nfor readers interested in nonmonotonic logic, and\nShanahan 2009a is a useful discussion of\nthe frame problem.  \nWooldridge 2000a deals with logical\nformalizations of rational agents.\n\n\nContents of this entry:\n",
