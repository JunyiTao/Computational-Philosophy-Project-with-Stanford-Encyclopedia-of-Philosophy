It contains Lakatos\u2019s important paper\n\u201cFalsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research\nProgrammes\u201d (FMSRP) which we have discussed already. A briefer\naccount of this methodology had already appeared (Lakatos 1968a), in\nwhich Lakatos distinguished dogmatic, na\u00efve and sophisticated\nfalsificationist positions, attributing them to\n\u201cPopper0, Popper1 and\nPopper2\u201d\u2014or as he otherwise put it,\n\u201cproto-Popper, pseudo-Popper and proper-Popper\u201d. (Popper\ndid not appreciate being disassembled into temporal or ideological\nparts and protested \u201cI am not a Trinity\u201d.)\n\nLakatos\u2019s methodology has been seen, rightly, as an attempt to\nreconcile Popper\u2019s falsificationism with the views of Thomas\nKuhn. Popper saw science as consisting of bold explanatory\nconjectures, and dramatic refutations that led to new conjectures.\nKuhn (and Polanyi before him) objected that\n\n\nNo process yet disclosed by the historical study of scientific\ndevelopment at all resembles the methodological stereotype of\nfalsification by direct comparison with nature (Kuhn 1962: 77).\n\n\nInstead, science consists of long periods of \u201cnormal\nscience\u201d, paradigm-based research, where the task is to force\nnature to fit the paradigm. When nature refuses to comply, this is not\nseen as a refutation, but rather as an anomaly. It casts doubt, not on\nthe ruling paradigm, but on the ingenuity of the\nscientists\u2014\u201conly the practitioner is blamed, not his\ntools\u201d. It is only in extraordinary periods of\n\u201crevolutionary science\u201d that anything like Popperian\nrefutations occur.\n\nLakatos proposed a middle-way, in which Kuhn\u2019s\nsocio-psychological tools were replaced by logico-methodological ones.\nThe basic unit of appraisal is not the isolated testable theory, but\nrather the \u201cresearch programme\u201d within which a series of\ntestable theories is generated. Each theory produced within a research\nprogramme contains the same common or \u201chard core\u201d\nassumptions, surrounded by a \u201cprotective belt\u201d of\nauxiliary hypotheses. When a particular theory is refuted, adherents\nof a programme do not pin the blame on their hard-core assumptions,\nwhich they render \u201cirrefutable by fiat\u201d. Instead,\ncriticism is directed at the hypotheses in the \u201cprotective\nbelt\u201d and they are modified to deal with the problem.\nImportantly, these modifications are not random\u2014they are in the\nbest cases guided by the heuristic principles implicit in the\n\u201chard core\u201d of the programme. A programme progresses\ntheoretically if the new theory solves the anomaly faced by the old\nand is independently testable, making new predictions. A programme\nprogresses empirically if at least one of these new predictions is\nconfirmed.\n\nNotice that a programme can make progress, both theoretically and\nempirically, even though every theory produced within it is refuted. A\nprogramme degenerates if its successive theories are not\ntheoretically progressive (because it predicts no novel\nfacts), or not empirically progressive (because novel\npredictions get refuted). Furthermore, and contrary to Kuhn\u2019s\nidea that normally science is dominated by a single paradigm, Lakatos\nclaimed that the history of science typically consists of\ncompeting research programmes. A scientific revolution occurs\nwhen a degenerating programme is superseded by a progressive one. It\nacquires hegemonic status though its rivals may persist as minority\nreports.\n\nKuhn saw all this as vindicating his own view, albeit with different\nterminology (Kuhn 1970: 256, 1977: 1). But this missed the\nsignificance of replacing Kuhn\u2019s socio-psychological\ndescriptions with logico-methodological ones. It also missed\nLakatos\u2019s claim that there are always competing programmes or\nparadigms. Hegemony is seldom as total as Kuhn seems to suggest.\n",
