There was no central decision about who should\nproduce tin, or whether anyone should; no central decision about who\nshould consume tin, or whether anyone should; no central decision\nabout what should be given in return for tin. All that happened is\nthat some people guessed that if they were to produce tin and bring it\nto market, it would be worth something to customers\u2014enough to\nmake the venture worthwhile. When some of these guesses prove correct\nand trades are consummated, a market in tin emerges and becomes part\nof what brings people together as partners in mutually beneficial\nventures.\n\nPrice signals thus economize on information. In the process,\nthey induce patterns of cooperation that involve multitudes.\nCooperation evolves among people who need not share a language, need\nnot be aware of each other\u2019s existence, and need not be aware of\ntheir mutual dependence. They are only vaguely aware of the thousands\nof jobs that need doing so as to supply inputs that enable them to\nhave a finished product to sell. Particular agents seldom if ever have\nmore than a glimpse of the big picture, yet they manage to come\ntogether to form a community, and almost all are vastly better off as\na result.\n",
