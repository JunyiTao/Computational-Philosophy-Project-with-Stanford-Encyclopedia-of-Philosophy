Suspicions about Essentialism\n\nIn \u00a73, we passed over without comment the parenthetical phrase\nfrom Quine\u2019s characterization of essentialism. Adding that\nphrase to the first view of essentialism from \u00a73 yields:\n\nessentialism is the doctrine that (at least some) objects have\nindependently of how they are referred to (at least some)\nessential properties.\n\n\nThe added phrase stresses that the essentialist thinks that it at\nleast makes sense to ask of an object (\u201cin itself\u201d)\nwhether it must have a particular property. Skeptics about\nessentialism have doubted the very intelligibility of such a question.\nHere is one prominent thought behind such anti-essentialism. (See\nQuine 1960, pp. 195\u2013200.) Since it is necessary that seven plus two is\ngreater than seven, when the number nine is referred to as\n\u2018seven plus two\u2019 it is essentially greater than seven.\nBut, since it is not necessary that the number of planets is greater\nthan seven, when the number nine is referred to as \u2018the number\nof planets\u2019 it is not essentially greater than seven. The point\nis supposed to be that it makes no sense to say of the number nine,\nindependently of any way of referring to it, that it is or is not\nessentially greater than seven. Similarly, an anti-essentialist might\nsay that when a person who is both a mathematician and a cyclist is\nthought of as a mathematician, being rational is essential to him,\nwhile being two-legged is not; but when the very same person is\nthought of as a cyclist, then although being two-legged is essential\nto him, being rational is not. Again, the point is supposed to be that\nit makes no sense to say of the very person who is the mathematical\ncyclist, independently of any way of thinking about him, that he is or\nis not essentially rational (or two-legged). According to the\nanti-essentialist, asking whether Andrew Wiles (who we may suppose is\na cycling mathematician) could fail to be rational is like asking\nwhether Andrew Wiles is taller than\u2014both questions demand\nanother relatum. Could he fail to be rational, relative to what\nway of referring to him? Is he taller than whom?\n\nIn response the essentialist will point out that the\nanti-essentialist\u2019s thought does not square very well with\nintuition. Consider the object that is referred to by all these\nphrases: \u2018nine\u2019, \u2018seven plus two\u2019, \u2018the\nnumber of planets\u2019. Could that very object have failed\nto be greater than seven? Intuitively the question seems intelligible,\nand the answer seems to be that it could not have failed to be greater\nthan seven. According to intuition then, the very object that is\nreferred to by \u2018the number of planets\u2019 (which is the very\nsame object that is referred to by \u2018seven plus two\u2019 and\n\u2018nine\u2019) is essentially greater than seven. Intuition also\nhas it that the claim that the number of planets is greater than seven\nis not itself necessary. To add some jargon: Intuition has it that the\nclaim that it is necessary that the number of planets is greater than\nseven is true read de re (\u201cof the thing\u201d), but\nfalse read de dicto (\u201cof the dictum\u201d or \u201cof\nthe statement\u201d). (The de re reading is this: the number\nof planets has the property of being necessarily greater than seven.\nThe de dicto reading is this: the claim that the number of\nplanets is greater than seven has the property of being necessary.)\nThe essentialist is pointing out that the anti-essentialist\u2019s argument\nasserts that the latter intuition undermines the former, but does not\nsay why.\n",
