    "main_text": "Aim and Method\n2. Aim and Method\n\n\nRosmini describes his aim and method at some length in his On\nthe Studies of the Author. He sets out to combat error, to\nsystematise the truth, to present a philosophy that can serve as a\nbasis for the various branches of knowledge, and to offer philosophy as\nan aid to theology. To achieve this, he upholds freedom to\nphilosophise, and sets out to reconcile, whenever possible, apparently\ncontrasting views. His intention throughout is to present an image of\nknowledge as one, simple and indivisible.\n2.1 Combating error\n\n\nNo one, he maintains, would err for the sake of erring.\nPhilosophical tradition in particular provides an object lesson in the\nmovement towards truth, and the elimination of error. Nevertheless, the\npath forward is not pursued without error because the movement towards\nhigher levels of reflection takes place unevenly. Responses to\nquestions at level A are no longer adequate in form to resolve\nquestions at level B, which inevitably take on new aspects through\ntheir application to new circumstances. The role of the philosopher is\nto distinguish the form of difficulties, which may vary from age to age\nor generation to generation, and to formulate questions in such a way\nthat it is possible to see both their historical antecedents and the\nunderlying principles to be employed in solving them. The process,\nhowever, will never be complete. The same principles will always cry\nout for application to new cases, and the same struggle to avoid error\nwill ensue.\n2.2 Systematising the truth\n\n\nThe negative task of combating error is not, however, sufficient.\nWhat is needed in addition, says Rosmini, is a \u2018system of\ntruth\u2019, that is, a system which shows clearly how the passage is\nmade from the most general, self-evident principles to more particular\nlevels of knowledge. Knowledge-wise, we move instinctively from the\nmore general to the particular. A mother does not begin by naming\nroses, carnation and other species for her children; she first\nindicates them all as \u2018flowers\u2019 before calling them by\ntheir particular names. So \u2018being\u2019, which is the most\ngeneral of all notions, is the fundamental principle of human\nknowledge which draws together every aspect of being. When\n\u2018being\u2019 is seen as the supreme principle of unity on which\nall knowledge depends, truth\u2014\u2018being as\nknown\u2019\u2014has been systematised and is seen in all its\nbeauty. Since, however, the full application of being is never seen\nonce and for all, it is better to ensure adherence to principle than\nto grasp at unconnected facts which serve at best as a ragbag of\nerudition\u2014better to grasp the principle of the wheel, for\nexample, than to know only a number of its applications.\n2.3 Philosophy as a basis for the various branches of knowledge\n\n\nPhilosophy as \u2018the study of the final reasons\u2019 is thus\ncentral to Rosmini\u2019s understanding. For him, the Enlightenment, with\nits sensistic, subjectivist attitude and devotion to the act of\nreasoning, rather than to the light of reason, degenerates inevitably\ninto a hotchpotch of negation and ignorance, leading to radical\ncorruption in ethics, and every other branch of philosophical\nendeavour.\n2.4 Philosophy as an aid to theology\n\n\nThe fragmentation of philosophy and its consequent separation from\ntheology is, according to Rosmini, a necessary consequence of\nsensationalist thinking. There can be no place for revealed doctrine to\nbe expounded as true science unless certain truths are already\ndemonstrated, in the logical order at least, by philosophical reason.\nOn the other hand, theology itself often cannot make progress unless it\nis prepared to turn to philosophy for assistance. The notions of body,\nof person and of many other matters essential to theology, cannot be\nadequately expressed in isolation from philosophical teaching. In its\nturn, according to Rosmini, divine revelation does not cancel, but\ncompletes and ennobles reason, especially by drawing its attention to\nproblems such as the relationship between person and nature which would\notherwise escape its attention.\n2.5 Freedom to Philosophise\n\n\nError, the antithesis of knowledge, is the only intellectual\nimpediment to free, philosophical thought. From this principle, Rosmini\nconcludes that assent to erroneous prejudices, not assent to prejudice\nas such, is the principal obstacle to be overcome by philosophers.\nTheir work consists in examining preconceptions and determining their\ntruth in order to provide grounds for rational persuasion about what\nthey know. To maintain, as many do, that the possession of some\nunproven truth is inimical to philosophical thought is tantamount to\nrequiring nil knowledge in the prospective philosopher. Rather, a\nperson who knows something, but has not yet come to grips with the\nreasons leading to it, is like a person who knows the answer to a\nproblem, but still has to consider the reason for the answer. In this\ncase, freedom is not constrained. The point at issue, therefore, in the\ncase of religion, is not that Christians, or Buddhists, or Muslims, or\nany other religious persons, are necessarily hampered by their beliefs,\nbut whether these beliefs are true, and to what extent they are true.\nIt is not sufficient to state simply that only persons who are devoid\nof any belief are capable of philosophising freely. Rather\ntotal freedom is a necessary condition of the truth of\nfaith. If faith were considered divine although in conflict with\nreason, it would impose an impossible obligation and totally inhibit\nour reasoning activity. We would be unable to give our assent to either\nreason or faith, and would thus remain deprived of truth (IP\n39 [All numbers in references to Rosmini\u2019s works are to paragraphs, not\nto pages]).\n\n\nIt is not the case, Rosmini would affirm, that only non-believers\nhave the capacity to enter the world of philosophical enquiry.\n2.6 Reconciliation of Conclusions\n\n\nAccording to Rosmini, eclecticism, especially that upheld by Victor\nCousin, is not the way to promote reconciliation between conclusions.\nPhilosophical systems are not brought together as a result of arbitrary\nchoice between what they offer. Each system, if it is truly such, will\nhave a principle from which deductions are made, and will be able to be\nreconciled, despite accidental differences, with every other system\nsharing the same principle. On the other hand, systems will not be\nreconcilable, despite their accidental agreement, if their basic\nprinciples differ. In the former case, agreement will be possible by\nworking back to the principle, and setting out once more from there; in\nthe second case, apparent agreement will only be skin-deep. Only shared\nprinciples allow for effective reconciliation between systems.\n",
