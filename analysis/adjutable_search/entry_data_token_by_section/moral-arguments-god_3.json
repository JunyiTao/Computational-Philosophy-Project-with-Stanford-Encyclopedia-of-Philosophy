Arguments from Human Dignity or Worth\n\nMany philosophers find Immanuel Kant\u2019s moral philosophy still\noffers a fruitful approach to ethics. Of the various forms of the\n\u201ccategorical imperative\u201d that Kant offers, the formula\nthat regards human beings as \u201cends in themselves\u201d is\nespecially attractive: \u201cAct in such a way that you always treat\nhumanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other,\nnever simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end\u201d\n(Kant 1785 [1964], 96). Many contemporary moral philosophers\ninfluenced by Kant, such as Christine Korsgaard (1996), see Kant as\noffering a \u201cconstructivist\u201d metaethical position.\nConstructivism is supposed to offer a \u201cthird way\u201d between\nmoral realism and subjectivist views of morality. Like subjectivists,\nconstructivists want to see morality as a human creation. However,\nlike moral realists constructivists want to see moral questions as\nhaving objective answers. Constructivism is an attempt to develop an\nobjective morality that is free of the metaphysical commitments of\nmoral realism.\n\nIt is, however, controversial whether Kant himself was a\nconstructivist in this sense. One reason to question whether this is\nthe right way to read Kant follows from the fact that Kant himself did\nnot see morality as free from metaphysical commitments. For example,\nKant thought that it would be impossible for someone who believed that\nmechanistic determinism was the literal truth about himself to believe\nthat he was a moral agent, since morality requires an autonomy that is\nincompatible with determinism. To see myself as a creature who has the\nkind of value Kant calls \u201cdignity\u201d I must not see myself\nmerely as a machine-like product of the physical environment. Hence\nKant thought that it was crucial for morality that his Critical\nPhilosophy had shown that the deterministic perspective on humans is\nsimply part of the \u201cphenomenal world\u201d that is the object\nof scientific knowledge, not the \u201cnoumenal reality\u201d that\nit would be if some kind of scientific realism were the true\nmetaphysical view. When we do science we see ourselves as determined,\nbut science tells us only how the world appears, not how it really is.\nRecognizing this fact suggests that when Kant posits that humans have\nthis intrinsic value he calls dignity, he is not\n\u201cconstructing\u201d the value humans have, but recognizing the\nvalue beings of a certain kind must have. Humans can only have this\nkind of value if they are a particular kind of creature. Whether Kant\nhimself was a moral realist or not, there are certainly elements in\nhis philosophy that push in a realist direction.\n\nIf the claim that human persons have a kind of intrinsic dignity or\nworth is a true objective principle and if it provides a key\nfoundational principle of morality, it is well worth asking what kinds\nof metaphysical implications the claim might have. This is the\nquestion that Mark Linville (2009, 417\u2013446) pursues in the\nsecond moral argument he develops. Linville begins by noting that one\ncould hardly hold that \u201chuman persons have intrinsic\ndignity\u201d could be true if human persons do not exist. Clearly,\nsome metaphysical positions do include a denial of the existence of\nhuman persons, such as forms of Absolute Monism which hold that only\none Absolute Reality exists. However, it also seems to be the case\nthat some forms of Scientific Naturalism are committed to the denial\nof \u201cpersons as substantive selves that essentially\npossess a first-person point of view\u201d (See Dennett 2006, 107).\nDaniel Dennett, for example, holds that persons will not be part of\nthe ultimately true scientific account of things. Dennett holds that\nto think of humans as persons is simply to adopt a certain\n\u201cstance\u201d toward them that he calls the \u201cintentional\nstance,\u201d but it is clear that the kind of picture of humans we\nget when we think of them in this way does not correspond with their\nintrinsic metaphysical properties. It is not clear how systems towards\nwhich we adopt an \u201cintentional stance\u201d could be truly\nautonomous and thus have the kind of value Kant believes human persons\nhave.\n\nThe argument from human dignity could be put into propositional form\nas follows:\n\nHuman persons have a\nspecial kind of intrinsic value that we call dignity.\nThe only (or best)\nexplanation of the fact that humans possess dignity is that they are\ncreated by a supremely good God in God\u2019s own image.\nProbably there is a\nsupremely good God.\n\n\nA naturalist may want to challenge premise (2) by finding some other\nstrategy to explain human dignity. Michael Martin (2002), for example,\nhas tried to suggest that moral judgments can be analyzed as the\nfeelings of approval or disapproval of a perfectly impartial and\ninformed observer. Linville (2009) objects that it is not clear how\nthe feelings of such an observer could constitute the intrinsic worth\nof a person, since one would think that intrinsic properties would be\nnon-relational and mind-independent. In any case, Linville notes that\na \u201cEuthyphro\u201d problem lurks for such an ideal observer\ntheory, since one would think that such an observer would judge a\nperson to be intrinsically valuable because the person has intrinsic\nvalue.\n\nAnother strategy that is pursued by constructivists such as Korsgaard\nis to link the value ascribed to humans to the capacity for rational\nreflection. The idea is that insofar as I am committed to rational\nreflection, I must value myself as having this capacity, and\nconsistently value others who have it as well. A similar strategy is\nfound in Wielenberg\u2019s form of ethical non-naturalism, since\nWielenberg argues that it is necessarily true that any being with\ncertain reflective capacities will have moral rights (Wielenberg,\n2014, chapter 4). It is far from clear that human rationality provides\nan adequate ground for moral rights, however. Many people believe that\nyoung infants and people suffering from dementia still have this\nintrinsic dignity, but in both cases there is no capacity for rational\nreflection.\n\nSome support for this criticism of the attempt to see reason as the\nbasis of the value of humans can be found in Nicholas\nWolterstorff\u2019s recent work on justice (2007, especially Ch. 8).\nWolterstorff in this work defends the claim that there are natural\nhuman rights, and that violating such rights is one way of acting\nunjustly towards a person. Why do humans have such rights?\nWolterstorff says these rights are grounded in the basic worth or\ndignity that humans possess. When I seek to torture or kill an\ninnocent human I am failing to respect this worth. If one asks why we\nshould think humans possess such worth, Wolterstorff argues that the\nbelief that humans have this quality was not only historically\nproduced by Jewish and Christian conceptions of the human person, but\neven now cannot be defended apart from such a conception. In\nparticular, he argues that attempts to argue that our worth stems from\nsome excellence we possess such as reason will not explain the worth\nof infants or those with severe brain injuries or dementia.\n\nDoes a theistic worldview fare better in explaining the special value\nof human dignity? In a theistic universe God is himself seen as the\nsupreme good. Indeed, theistic Platonists usually identify God with\nthe Good. If God is himself a person, then this seems to be a\ncommitment to the idea that personhood itself is something that must\nbe intrinsically good. If human persons are made in God\u2019s image,\nas both Judaism and Christianity affirm, then it would seem to follow\nthat humans do have a kind of intrinsic value, just by way of being\nthe kind of creatures they are.\n\nThis argument will of course be found unconvincing to many. Some will\ndeny premise (1), either because they reject moral realism as a\nmetaethical stance, or because they reject the normative claim that\nhumans have any kind of special value or dignity. (Maybe they will\neven think that such a claim is a form of \u201cspeciesism.\u201d).\nOthers will find premise (2) suspect. They may be inclined to agree\nthat human persons have a special dignity, but hold that the source of\nthat dignity can be found in such human qualities as rationality. With\nrespect to the status of infants and those suffering from dementia,\nthe critic might bite the bullet and just accept the fact that human\ndignity does not extend to them, or else argue that the fact that\ninfants and those suffering mental breakdown are part of a species\nwhose members typically possess rationality merits them a special\nrespect, even if they lack this quality as individuals. Others will\nfind premise (2) doubtful because they find the theistic explanation\nof dignity unclear. Another alternative is to seek a Constructivist\naccount of dignity, perhaps regarding the special status of humans as\nsomething we humans decide to extend to each other. Perhaps the\nstrongest non-theistic alternative would be some form of ethical\nnon-naturalism, in which one simply affirms that the claim that\npersons have a special dignity is an a priori truth\nrequiring no explanation. In effect this is a decision for a\nnon-theistic form of Platonism.\n\nThe proponent of the argument may well agree that claims about the\nspecial status of humans are true a priori, and\nthus also opt for some form of Platonism. However, the proponent of\nthe argument will point out that some necessary truths can be\nexplained by other necessary truths. The theist believes that these\ntruths about the special status of humans tell us something about the\nkind of universe humans find themselves in. To say that humans are\ncreated by God is to say that personhood is not an ephemeral or\naccidental feature of the universe, because at bottom reality itself\nis personal (Mavrodes 1986).\n",
