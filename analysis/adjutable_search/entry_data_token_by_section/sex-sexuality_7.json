    "main_text": "Normative Issues || Sexual Perversion\n2.3 Sexual Perversion\n\nThe most famous contemporary philosophical account is Thomas\nNagel\u2019s psychologically-based view of sexual perversion.\n\u201cNatural\u201d sexual desire involves a multi-leveled mutual\nawareness by two people of each other: X perceives sexual\nexcitement in Y, Y perceives excitement in\nX, X perceives that Y is excited by\nX, and so on (1969, 10\u201312). Sexual desire is complex in\nthat it includes X\u2019s sexual arousal by Y and\nX\u2019s feeling sexual because of Y\u2019s\narousal by X, and so on with higher levels. Sexual\nperversions are then standing preferences for sexual activity that\ndoes not involve such multi-levels of sexual arousal. Since this view\nlocates naturalness and perversion in the agent\u2019s preferences,\nthe sexual act itself need not mirror this structure; only the desires\nneed have this complexity. Thus, it is inaccurate to accuse it of\nbeing sexless (Solomon 1974, 336) or to evaluate it by giving examples\nof non-complex sexual acts (Kupfer 2016, 333).\n\nAlthough this view accommodates some perversions, such as zoophilia,\npedophilia, and \u201cintercourse with \u2026 inanimate\nobjects\u201d because they \u201cseem to be stuck at some primitive\nversion of the first stage of sexual feeling\u201d (Nagel 1969, 14),\nit yields counter-intuitive results: masturbation does not fare well\non this view, depending on whether it insists on the perception of the\nactual (not imaginative) embodiment of desire in another person (Soble\n2013a, 85\u201387). It also misunderstands how perversions usually\nwork: a coprophiliac does not normally desire sex with feces,\nbut to incorporate feces in his sexual act with another, which could\ninvolve multi-levels of perception. Moreover, the account does not\ncapture common intuitions about natural and perverted sex: it goes\nbeyond the plausible idea that the arousal of one partner increases\nthe other\u2019s, to that of multi-layered arousal\u2014an\nunintuitive idea. Similar views rely on the idea that natural sexual\ndesire is interpersonal, such as that it culminates in love (Scruton\n1986, ch. 10) and that it communicates attitudes and feelings (Solomon\n1974; see Halwani 2018b, ch. 9 for discussion).\n\nA non-psychological account of sexual perversion, one closer to folk\nbiology, claims that only reproduction allows us to distinguish\nperversions from non-perversions (Ruddick 1984, 287; cf. Gray 1978).\nThis does not mean that every act has to be reproductive, only that\nnatural sexual desires \u201ccould lead to reproduction in\nnormal physiological circumstances\u201d (Ruddick 1984, 288). Thus, a\nheterosexual couple having intercourse but not intending to procreate\nare not engaging in perverted sex: their desire is of the\nkind that, under \u201cnormal physiological\ncircumstances,\u201d could lead to reproduction (1984, 288).\n\nThe account might have implausible implications, however. Anyone who\nprefers (heterosexual) oral sex to intercourse would be perverted.\nMoreover, any heterosexual couple that incorporate fetish objects,\nurine, feces, and so on, in their sexual intercourse would be\nsexually natural (Gray 1978, 190\u2013192; Primoratz 1999,\n53\u201354). Indeed, coprophilia can sink all the above accounts: two\npeople who exhibit inter-personal attitudes in the form of multi-level\nperceptions, and who have sexual intercourse of the reproductive type,\ncommunicating healthy emotions sincerely, yet use feces in their\nactivity would counter-intuitively not be perverted on any of the\nabove accounts.\n\nEven though explaining perversion in terms of biology seems obvious,\n\u201cperversion\u201d is opposed not only to \u201cnatural,\u201d\nbut also to \u201cnormal,\u201d and the natural and the normal do\nnot fully overlap. Moreover, the concept of \u201cperversion\u201d\ncould refer to many things: the immoral, disgusting, bizarre, and\nbiologically abnormal, among others. Using only one of these to define\n\u201cperversion\u201d will probably fail. It might also be that the\nmethodology of discussing this concept is flawed, failing to account\nfor the concept\u2019s social function (Miller 2010). Thus, some\nphilosophers have proposed to get rid of the concept altogether\n(Priest 1997; Primoratz 1999, ch. 6; Ruse 1988, 197\u2013201).\nRecently, however, a new account of perversion in terms of its\ninhibiting \u201cshared joy, mutual exploration, self-affirmation,\nand union\u201d was offered (Kupfer 2016, 351). But this view seems\nto set the bar too high for what counts as non-perverted.\n\nA good account of perversion might have to be prescriptive, capturing\nthe core of perversion but not necessarily capturing all our beliefs\nabout it (it should explain why our beliefs are mistaken when they\nare). Furthermore, it will likely be a psychological account, a\npreference to have sex with or involving certain types of object that\nare anti-life, such as bodily waste and corpses, and that are\nbiologically odd, such as inter-species sexual intercourse.\nEvolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology would have to play\ncrucial roles.\n",
