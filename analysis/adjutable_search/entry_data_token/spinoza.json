Biography\n\nBento (in Hebrew, Baruch; in Latin, Benedictus: all three names mean\n\u201cblessed\u201d) Spinoza was born in 1632 in Amsterdam. He was\nthe middle son in a prominent family of moderate means in\nAmsterdam\u2019s Portuguese-Jewish community. As a boy he had\nundoubtedly been one of the star pupils in the congregation\u2019s\nTalmud Torah school. He was intellectually gifted, and this could not\nhave gone unremarked by the congregation\u2019s rabbis. It is\npossible that Spinoza, as he made progress through his studies, was\nbeing groomed for a career as a rabbi. But he never made it into the\nupper levels of the curriculum, those which included advanced study of\nTalmud. At the age of seventeen, he was forced to cut short his formal\nstudies to help run the family\u2019s importing business.\n\nAnd then, on July 27, 1656, Spinoza was issued the harshest writ of\nherem, ban or excommunication, ever pronounced by the\nSephardic community of Amsterdam; it was never rescinded. We do not\nknow for certain what Spinoza\u2019s \u201cmonstrous deeds\u201d\nand \u201cabominable heresies\u201d were alleged to have been, but\nan educated guess comes quite easy. No doubt he was giving utterance\nto just those ideas that would soon appear in his philosophical\ntreatises. In those works, Spinoza denies the immortality of the soul;\nstrongly rejects the notion of a transcendent, providential\nGod\u2014the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and claims that the Law\n(i.e., the commandments of the Torah and rabbinic legal principles)\nwas neither literally given by God nor any longer binding on Jews. Can\nthere be any mystery as to why one of history\u2019s boldest and most\nradical thinkers was sanctioned by an orthodox Jewish community?\n\nTo all appearances, Spinoza was content finally to have an excuse for\ndeparting from the community and leaving Judaism behind; his faith and\nreligious commitment were, by this point, gone. Within a few years, he\nleft Amsterdam altogether. By the time his extant correspondence\nbegins, in 1661, he is living in Rijnsburg, not far from Leiden. While\nin Rijnsburg, he worked on the Treatise on the Emendation of the\nIntellect, an essay on philosophical method, and the Short\nTreatise on God, Man and His Well-Being, an initial but aborted\neffort to lay out his metaphysical, epistemological and moral views.\nHis critical exposition of Descartes\u2019s Principles of\nPhilosophy, the only work he published under his own name in his\nlifetime, was completed in 1663, after he had moved to Voorburg,\noutside The Hague. By this time, he was also working on what would\neventually be called the Ethics, his philosophical\nmasterpiece. However, when he saw the principles of toleration in\nHolland being threatened by reactionary forces, including political\nmeddling by the Dutch Reformed Church, he put it aside to complete his\n\u201cscandalous\u201d Theological-Political Treatise,\npublished anonymously and to great alarm in 1670 (one overwrought\ncritic called it \u201ca book forged in hell by the devil\nhimself\u201d). When Spinoza died in 1677, in The Hague, he was still\nat work on his Political Treatise; this was soon published by\nhis friends along with his other unpublished writings, including a\nCompendium of Hebrew Grammar.\n2. Ethics\n\nThe Ethics is an ambitious and multifaceted work. It is also\nbold to the point of audacity, as one would expect of a systematic and\nunforgiving critique of the traditional philosophical and theological\nconceptions of God, the human being and the universe, especially as\nthese serve as the foundation of the major organized religions and\ntheir moral and ceremonial rules. What Spinoza intends to demonstrate\n(in the strongest sense of that word) is the truth about God, nature\nand especially ourselves, and the most certain and useful principles\nof society, religion and the good life. Despite the great deal of\nmetaphysics, physics, anthropology and psychology that take up Parts\nOne through Three, Spinoza took the crucial message of the work to be\nethical in nature. It consists in showing that our happiness and\nwell-being lie not in a life enslaved to the passions and to the\ntransitory goods we ordinarily pursue, nor in the related unreflective\nattachment to the superstitions that pass as religion, but rather in\nthe life of reason. To clarify and support these broadly ethical\nconclusions, however, Spinoza must first demystify the universe and\nshow it for what it really is. This requires laying out some\nmetaphysical foundations, the project of Part One.\n2.1 God or Nature\n\n\u201cOn God\u201d begins with some deceptively simple definitions\nof terms that would be familiar to any seventeenth century\nphilosopher. \u201cBy substance I understand what is in itself and is\nconceived through itself\u201d; \u201cBy attribute I understand what\nthe intellect perceives of a substance, as constituting its\nessence\u201d; \u201cBy God I understand a being absolutely\ninfinite, i.e., a substance consisting of an infinity of attributes,\nof which each one expresses an eternal and infinite essence.\u201d\nThe definitions of Part One are, in effect, simply clear concepts that\nground the rest of his system. They are followed by a number of axioms\nthat, he assumes, will be regarded as obvious and unproblematic by the\nphilosophically informed (\u201cWhatever is, is either in itself or\nin another\u201d; \u201cFrom a given determinate cause the effect\nfollows necessarily\u201d). From these, the first proposition\nnecessarily follows, and every subsequent proposition can be\ndemonstrated using only what precedes it. (References to the\nEthics will be by part (I\u2013V), proposition (p),\ndefinition (d), scholium (s) and corollary (c).)\n\nIn propositions one through fifteen of Part One, Spinoza presents the\nbasic elements of his picture of God. God is the infinite, necessarily\nexisting (that is, self-caused), unique substance of the universe.\nThere is only one substance in the universe; it is God; and everything\nelse that is, is in God.\n\n\nProposition 1: A substance is prior in nature\nto its affections.\n\nProposition 2: Two substances having different\nattributes have nothing in common with one another. (In other words,\nif two substances differ in nature, then they have nothing in\ncommon).\n\nProposition 3: If things have nothing in\ncommon with one another, one of them cannot be the cause of the\nother.\n\nProposition 4: Two or more distinct things are\ndistinguished from one another, either by a difference in the\nattributes [i.e., the natures or essences] of the substances or by a\ndifference in their affections [i.e., their accidental\nproperties].\n\nProposition 5: In nature, there cannot be two\nor more substances of the same nature or attribute.\n\nProposition 6: One substance cannot be\nproduced by another substance.\n\nProposition 7: It pertains to the nature of a\nsubstance to exist.\n\nProposition 8: Every substance is necessarily\ninfinite.\n\nProposition 9: The more reality or being each\nthing has, the more attributes belong to it.\n\nProposition 10: Each attribute of a substance\nmust be conceived through itself.\n\nProposition 11: God, or a substance consisting\nof infinite attributes, each of which expresses eternal and infinite\nessence, necessarily exists. (The proof of this proposition consists\nsimply in the classic \u201contological proof for God\u2019s\nexistence\u201d. Spinoza writes that \u201cif you deny this,\nconceive, if you can, that God does not exist. Therefore, by axiom 7\n[\u2018If a thing can be conceived as not existing, its essence does\nnot involve existence\u2019], his essence does not involve existence.\nBut this, by proposition 7, is absurd. Therefore, God necessarily\nexists, q.e.d.\u201d)\n\nProposition 12: No attribute of a substance\ncan be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be\ndivided.\n\nProposition 13: A substance which is\nabsolutely infinite is indivisible.\n\nProposition 14: Except God, no substance can\nbe or be conceived.\n\n\nThis proof that God\u2014an infinite, eternal (necessary and\nself-caused), indivisible being\u2014is the only substance of the\nuniverse proceeds in three simple steps. First, establish that no two\nsubstances can share an attribute or essence (Ip5). Then, prove that\nthere is a substance with infinite attributes (i.e., God) (Ip11). It\nfollows, in conclusion, that the existence of that infinite substance\nprecludes the existence of any other substance. For if there\nwere to be a second substance, it would have to have\nsome attribute or essence. But since God has all\npossible attributes, then the attribute to be possessed by this second\nsubstance would be one of the attributes already possessed by God. But\nit has already been established that no two substances can have the\nsame attribute. Therefore, there can be, besides God, no such second\nsubstance.\n\nIf God is the only substance, and (by axiom 1) whatever is, is either\na substance or in a substance, then everything else must be\nin God. \u201cWhatever is, is in God, and nothing can be or be\nconceived without God\u201d (Ip15). Those things that are\n\u201cin\u201d God (or, more precisely, in God\u2019s attributes)\nare what Spinoza calls \u2018modes\u2019 (or\n\u2018affections\u2019).\n\nAs soon as this preliminary conclusion has been established, Spinoza\nimmediately reveals the objective of his attack. His definition of\nGod\u2014condemned since his excommunication from the Jewish\ncommunity as a \u201cGod existing in only a philosophical\nsense\u201d\u2014is meant to preclude any anthropomorphizing of the\ndivine being. In the scholium to proposition fifteen, he writes\nagainst \u201cthose who feign a God, like man, consisting of a body\nand a mind, and subject to passions. But how far they wander from the\ntrue knowledge of God, is sufficiently established by what has already\nbeen demonstrated.\u201d Besides being false, such an anthropomorphic\nconception of God standing as judge over us can have only deleterious\neffects on human freedom and activity, insofar as it fosters a life\nenslaved to hope and fear and the superstitions to which such emotions\ngive rise.\n\nMuch of the technical language of Part One is, to all appearances,\nright out of Descartes. But even the most devoted Cartesian would have\nhad a hard time understanding (and, certainly, accepting) the full\nimport of propositions one through fifteen. What does it mean to say\nthat God is substance and that everything else is \u201cin\u201d\nGod? Is Spinoza saying that rocks, tables, chairs, birds, mountains,\nrivers and human beings are all properties of God, and hence\ncan be predicated of God (just as one would say that the table\n\u201cis red\u201d)? It seems very odd to think that objects and\nindividuals\u2014what we ordinarily think of as independent\n\u201cthings\u201d\u2014are, in fact, merely properties of a thing,\nitems that inhere in something else. Spinoza was sensitive to the\nstrangeness of this kind of talk, not to mention the philosophical\nproblems to which it gives rise. When a person feels pain, does it\nfollow that the pain is ultimately just a property of God,\nand thus that God feels pain? All of this has given rise to a great\ndeal of scholarly debate as to what Spinoza means by saying all things\nbeing modes of or \u201cin\u201d God. They may also explain why, as\nof Proposition Sixteen, there is a subtle but important shift in\nSpinoza\u2019s language. God is now described not so much as the\nunderlying substance of all things, but as the universal, immanent and\nsustaining cause of all that exists: \u201cFrom the necessity of the\ndivine nature there must follow infinitely many things in infinitely\nmany modes, (i.e., everything that can fall under an infinite\nintellect)\u201d.\n\nAccording to the traditional Judeo-Christian conception of divinity,\nGod is a transcendent creator, a being who causes a world distinct\nfrom himself to come into being by creating it out of nothing. God\nproduces that world by a spontaneous act of free will, and could just\nas easily have not created anything outside himself. By contrast,\nSpinoza\u2019s God is the cause of all things because all things\nfollow causally and necessarily from the divine nature. Or, as he puts\nit, from God\u2019s infinite power or nature \u201call things have\nnecessarily flowed, or always followed, by the same necessity and in\nthe same way as from the nature of a triangle it follows, from\neternity and to eternity, that its three angles are equal to two right\nangles\u201d (Ip17s1). The existence of the world is, thus,\nmathematically necessary. It is impossible that God should exist but\nnot the world. This does not mean that God does not cause the world to\ncome into being freely, since nothing outside of God\nconstrains him to bring it into existence. But Spinoza does deny that\nGod creates the world by some arbitrary and undetermined act of free\nwill. God could not have done otherwise. There are no alternatives to\nthe actual world\u2014no other possible worlds\u2014and there is no\ncontingency or spontaneity within the world. Nothing could possibly\nhave been otherwise. Everything is absolutely and necessarily\ndetermined.\n\n(Ip29): In nature there is nothing contingent, but all things have\nbeen determined from the necessity of the divine nature to exist and\nproduce an effect in a certain way.\n\n\n(Ip33): Things could have been produced by God in no other way, and in\nno other order than they have been produced.\n\n\nThere are, however, differences in the way things depend on God. As an\ninfinite being, God has infinite \u201cattributes\u201d. An\nattribute is best understood as a most basic way of being, a general\nnature that is expressed in determinate ways by particular things. We\nhave knowledge of only two of these attributes: thought and extension.\nSome features of the universe follow necessarily from God\u2014or,\nmore precisely, from the absolute nature of one of God\u2019s\nattributes\u2014in a direct and unmediated manner. These are the\nuniversal and eternal aspects of the world, and they do not come into\nor go out of being; Spinoza calls them \u201cinfinite modes\u201d.\nThey include the most general principles of the universe, together\ngoverning all things in all ways. From the attribute of extension\nthere follow the principles governing all extended objects (the truths\nof geometry) and laws governing the motion and rest of bodies (the\nlaws of physics); from the attribute of thought, there follow laws of\nthought (understood by commentators to be either the laws of logic or\nthe laws of psychology). Particular and individual things are causally\nmore remote from God. They are nothing but \u201caffections of\nGod\u2019s attributes, or modes by which God\u2019s attributes are\nexpressed in a certain and determinate way\u201d (Ip25c). More\nprecisely, they are finite modes.\n\nThere are two causal orders or dimensions governing the production and\nactions of particular things. On the one hand, they are determined by\nthe general laws of the universe that follow immediately from\nGod\u2019s natures. On the other hand, each particular thing is\ndetermined to act and to be acted upon by other particular things.\nThus, the actual behavior of a body in motion is a function not just\nof the universal laws of motion, but also of the other bodies in\nmotion and rest surrounding it and with which it comes into\ncontact.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s metaphysics of God is neatly summed up in a phrase\nthat occurs in the Latin (but not the original Dutch) edition of the\nEthics: \u201cGod, or Nature\u201d, Deus, sive\nNatura: \u201cThat eternal and infinite being we call God, or\nNature, acts from the same necessity from which he exists\u201d (Part\nIV, Preface). It is an ambiguous phrase, since Spinoza could be read\nas trying either to divinize nature or to naturalize God. But for the\ncareful reader there is no mistaking Spinoza\u2019s intention. The\nfriends who, after his death, published his writings left out the\n\u201cor Nature\u201d clause from the more widely accessible Dutch\nversion, probably out of fear of the reaction that this identification\nwould, predictably, arouse among a vernacular audience.\n\nThere are, Spinoza insists, two sides of Nature. First, there is the\nactive, productive aspect of the universe\u2014God and his\nattributes, from which all else follows. This is what Spinoza,\nemploying the same terms he used in the Short Treatise, calls\nNatura naturans, \u201cnaturing Nature\u201d. Strictly\nspeaking, this is identical with God. The other aspect of the universe\nis that which is produced and sustained by the active aspect,\nNatura naturata, \u201cnatured Nature\u201d.\n\nBy Natura naturata I understand whatever follows from the\nnecessity of God\u2019s nature, or from any of God\u2019s\nattributes, i.e., all the modes of God\u2019s attributes insofar as\nthey are considered as things that are in God, and can neither be nor\nbe conceived without God. (Ip29s).\n\n\nThere is some debate in the literature as to whether God is also to be\nidentified with Natura naturata. The more likely reading is\nthat God, as Nature, is both Natura naturans and Natura\nnaturata, and that the infinite and finite modes are not just\neffects of God or Nature\u2019s power but actually inhere in and\nexpress that infinite substance. Be that as it may, Spinoza\u2019s\nfundamental insight in Book One is that Nature is an indivisible,\neternal or self-caused, substantial whole\u2014in fact, it is the\nonly substantial whole. Outside of Nature, there is nothing,\nand everything that exists is a part of Nature and is brought into\nbeing by Nature with a deterministic necessity. This unified, unique,\nproductive, necessary being just is what is meant by\n\u2018God\u2019. Because of the necessity inherent in Nature, there\nis no teleology in the universe. God or Nature does not act for any\nends, and things do not exist for any set purposes. There are no\n\u201cfinal causes\u201d (to use the common Aristotelian phrase).\nGod does not \u201cdo\u201d things for the sake of anything else.\nThe order of things just follows from God\u2019s essences with an\ninviolable determinism. All talk of God\u2019s purposes, intentions,\ngoals, preferences or aims is just an anthropomorphizing fiction.\n\nAll the prejudices I here undertake to expose depend on this one: that\nmen commonly suppose that all natural things act, as men do, on\naccount of an end; indeed, they maintain as certain that God himself\ndirects all things to some certain end, for they say that God has made\nall things for man, and man that he might worship God. (I, Appendix)\n\n\nGod is not some goal-oriented planner who then judges things by how\nwell they conform to his purposes. Things happen only because of\nNature and its laws. \u201cNature has no end set before it \u2026\nAll things proceed by a certain eternal necessity of nature.\u201d To\nbelieve otherwise is to fall prey to the same superstitions that lie\nat the heart of the organized religions.\n\n\nPeople] find\u2014both in themselves and outside\nthemselves\u2014many means that are very helpful in seeking their own\nadvantage, e.g., eyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, plants and\nanimals for food, the sun for light, the sea for supporting fish\n\u2026 Hence, they consider all natural things as means to their own\nadvantage. And knowing that they had found these means, not provided\nthem for themselves, they had reason to believe that there was someone\nelse who had prepared those means for their use. For after they\nconsidered things as means, they could not believe that the things had\nmade themselves; but from the means they were accustomed to prepare\nfor themselves, they had to infer that there was a ruler, or a number\nof rulers of nature, endowed with human freedom, who had taken care of\nall things for them, and made all things for their use.\n\nAnd since they had never heard anything about the temperament of these\nrulers, they had to judge it from their own. Hence, they maintained\nthat the Gods direct all things for the use of men in order to bind\nmen to them and be held by men in the highest honor. So it has\nhappened that each of them has thought up from his own temperament\ndifferent ways of worshipping God, so that God might love them above\nall the rest, and direct the whole of Nature according to the needs of\ntheir blind desire and insatiable greed. Thus this prejudice was\nchanged into superstition, and struck deep roots in their minds. (I,\nAppendix)\n\n\nA judging God who has plans and acts purposively is a God to be obeyed\nand placated. Opportunistic preachers are then able to play on our\nhopes and fears in the face of such a God. They prescribe ways of\nacting that are calculated to avoid being punished by that God and\nearn his rewards. But, Spinoza insists, to see God or Nature as acting\nfor the sake of ends\u2014to find purpose in Nature\u2014is to\nmisconstrue Nature and \u201cturn it upside down\u201d by putting\nthe effect (the end result) before the true cause.\n\nNor does God perform miracles, since there are no, and cannot be,\ndepartures whatsoever from the necessary course of nature. This would\nbe for God or Nature to act against itself, which is absurd. The\nbelief in miracles is due only to ignorance of the true causes of\nphenomena.\n\nIf a stone has fallen from a room onto someone\u2019s head and killed\nhim, they will show, in the following way, that the stone fell in\norder to kill the man. For if it did not fall to that end, God willing\nit, how could so many circumstances have concurred by chance (for\noften many circumstances do concur at once)? Perhaps you will answer\nthat it happened because the wind was blowing hard and the man was\nwalking that way. But they will persist: why was the wind blowing hard\nat that time? why was the man walking that way at that time? If you\nanswer again that the wind arose then because on the preceding day,\nwhile the weather was still calm, the sea began to toss, and that the\nman had been invited by a friend, they will press on\u2014for there\nis no end to the questions which can be asked: but why was the sea\ntossing? why was the man invited at just that time? And so they will\nnot stop asking for the causes of causes until you take refuge in the\nwill of God, i.e., the sanctuary of ignorance. (I, Appendix)\n\n\nThis is strong language, and Spinoza is clearly aware of the risks of\nhis position. The same preachers who take advantage of our credulity\nwill fulminate against anyone who tries to pull aside the curtain and\nreveal the truths of Nature. \u201cOne who seeks the true causes of\nmiracles, and is eager, like an educated man, to understand natural\nthings, not to wonder at them, like a fool, is generally considered\nand denounced as an impious heretic by those whom the people honor as\ninterpreters of nature and the Gods. For they know that if ignorance\nis taken away, then foolish wonder, the only means they have of\narguing and defending their authority is also taken away.\u201d\n\nFor centuries, Spinoza has been regarded\u2014by his enemies and his\npartisans, in the scholarly literature and the popular\nimagination\u2014as a \u201cpantheist\u201d. It is not clear,\nhowever, that this is the proper way to look at his conception of God.\nOf course, Spinoza is not a traditional theist, for whom God is a\ntranscendent and providential being. But does Spinoza\u2019s\nidentification of God with Nature mean that he is, as so many have\ninsisted for so long, from the early eighteenth century up through the\nmost recent edition of the Cambridge Dictionary of\nPhilosophy, a pantheist?\n\nIn general, pantheism is the view that rejects the transcendence of\nGod. According to the pantheist, God is, in some way, identical with\nthe world. There may be aspects of God that are ontologically or\nepistemologically distinct from the world, but for pantheism this must\nnot imply that God is essentially separate from the world. The\npantheist is also likely to reject any kind of anthropomorphizing of\nGod, or attributing to the deity psychological and moral\ncharacteristics modeled on human nature. The pantheist\u2019s God is\n(usually) not a personal God.\n\nWithin this general framework, it is possible to distinguish two\nvarieties of pantheism. First, pantheism can be understood as the\ndenial of any distinction whatsoever between God and the natural world\nand the assertion that God is in fact identical with everything that\nexists. \u201cGod is everything and everything is God.\u201d On this\nview, God is the world and all its natural contents, and nothing\ndistinct from them. This is reductive pantheism. Second, pantheism can\nbe understood as asserting that God is distinct from the world and its\nnatural contents but nonetheless contained or immanent within them,\nperhaps in the way in which water is contained in a saturated sponge.\nGod is everything and everywhere, on this version, by virtue of being\nwithin everything. This is immanentist pantheism; it involves that\nclaim that nature contains within itself, in addition to its natural\nelements, an immanent supernatural and divine element.\n\nIs Spinoza, then, a pantheist? Any adequate analysis of\nSpinoza\u2019s identification of God and Nature will show clearly\nthat Spinoza cannot be a pantheist in the second, immanentist sense.\nFor Spinoza, there is nothing but Nature and its attributes and modes.\nAnd within Nature there can certainly be nothing that is supernatural.\nIf Spinoza is seeking to eliminate anything, it is that which is above\nor beyond nature, which escapes the laws and processes of nature. But\nis he a pantheist in the first, reductive sense?\n\nThe issue of whether God is to be identified with the whole of Nature\n(i.e., Natura naturans and Natura naturata) or only\na part of Nature (i.e., Natura naturans alone), which has\noccupied a good deal of the recent literature, might be seen as\ncrucial to the question of Spinoza\u2019s alleged pantheism. After\nall, if pantheism is the view that God is everything, then Spinoza is\na pantheist only if he identifies God with all of Nature. Indeed, this\nis exactly how the issue is often framed. Both those who believe that\nSpinoza is a pantheist and those who believe that he is not a\npantheist focus on the question of whether God is to be identified\nwith the whole of Nature, including the infinite and finite modes of\nNatura naturata, or only with substance and its attributes\n(Natura naturans) but not the modes. Thus, it has been argued\nthat Spinoza is not a pantheist, because God is to be identified only\nwith substance and its attributes, the most universal, active causal\nprinciples of Nature, and not with any modes of substance. Other\nscholars have argued that Spinoza is a pantheist, just because he does\nidentify God with the whole of nature.\n\nHowever, this debate about the extent of Spinoza\u2019s\nidentification of God with Nature is not really to the point when the\nquestion is about Spinoza\u2019s alleged pantheism. To be sure, if by\n\u2018pantheism\u2019 is meant the idea that God is everything, and\nif one reads Spinoza as saying that God is only Natura\nnaturans, then Spinoza\u2019s God is not everything and\nconsequently Spinoza is not a pantheist, at least in the ordinary\nsense. Finite things, on this reading, while caused by the eternal,\nnecessary and active aspects of Nature, are not identical with God or\nsubstance, but rather are its effects. But this is not the interesting\nsense in which Spinoza is not a pantheist. For even if Spinoza does\nindeed identify God with the whole of Nature, it does not follow that\nSpinoza is a pantheist. The real issue is not what is the proper\nreading of the metaphysics of Spinoza\u2019s conception of God and\nits relationship to finite modes. On either interpretation,\nSpinoza\u2019s move is a naturalistic and reductive one. God is\nidentical either with all of Nature or with only a part of Nature; for\nthis reason, Spinoza shares something with the reductive pantheist.\nBut\u2014and this is the important point\u2014even the atheist can,\nwithout too much difficulty, admit that God is nothing but Nature.\nReductive pantheism and atheism maintain extensionally equivalent\nontologies.\n\nRather, the question of Spinoza\u2019s pantheism is really going to\nbe answered on the psychological side of things, with regard to the\nproper attitude to take toward Deus sive Natura. And however\none reads the relationship between God and Nature in Spinoza, it is a\nmistake to call him a pantheist in so far as pantheism is still a kind\nof religious theism. What really distinguishes the pantheist from the\natheist is that the pantheist does not reject as inappropriate the\nreligious psychological attitudes demanded by theism. Rather, the\npantheist simply asserts that God\u2014conceived as a being before\nwhich one is to adopt an attitude of worshipful awe\u2014is or is in\nNature. And nothing could be further from the spirit of\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophy. Spinoza does not believe that worshipful\nawe or religious reverence is an appropriate attitude to take before\nGod or Nature. There is nothing holy or sacred about Nature, and it is\ncertainly not the object of a religious experience. Instead, one\nshould strive to understand God or Nature, with the kind of adequate\nor clear and distinct intellectual knowledge that reveals\nNature\u2019s most important truths and shows how everything depends\nessentially and existentially on higher natural causes. The key to\ndiscovering and experiencing God, for Spinoza, is philosophy and\nscience, not religious awe and worshipful submission. The latter give\nrise only to superstitious behavior and subservience to ecclesiastic\nauthorities; the former leads to enlightenment, freedom and true\nblessedness (i.e., peace of mind).\n2.2 The Human Being\n\nIn Part Two, Spinoza turns to the nature of the human being. The two\nattributes of God of which we have knowledge are extension and\nthought. This, in itself, involves what would have been an astounding\nthesis in the eyes of his contemporaries, one that was usually\nmisunderstood and vilified. When Spinoza claims in Proposition Two\nthat \u201cExtension is an attribute of God, or God is an extended\nthing\u201d, he was almost universally\u2014but\nerroneously\u2014interpreted as saying that God is literally\ncorporeal. For just this reason, \u201cSpinozism\u201d became, for\nhis critics, synonymous with materialism.\n\nAccording to one interpretation, God is indeed material, even matter\nitself, but this does not imply that God is or has a body. Another\ninterpretation, however, one which will be adopted here, is that what\nis in God is not matter per se, but extension as an essence. And\nextension and thought are two distinct essences or natures that have\nabsolutely nothing in common. The modes or expressions of extension\nare physical bodies; the modes of thought are ideas. Because extension\nand thought have nothing in common, the two realms of matter and mind\nare causally closed systems. Everything that is extended follows from\nthe attribute of extension alone. Every bodily event is part of an\ninfinite causal series of bodily events and is determined only by the\nnature of extension and its laws, in conjunction with its relations to\nother extended bodies. Similarly, every idea or mental event follows\nonly from the attribute of thought. Any idea is an integral part of an\ninfinite series of ideas and is determined by the nature of thought\nand its laws, along with its relations to other ideas. There is, in\nother words, no causal interaction between bodies and ideas, between\nthe physical and the mental. There is, however, a thoroughgoing\ncorrelation and parallelism between the two series. For every mode in\nextension that is a relatively stable collection of matter (an\nindividual body), there is a corresponding mode in thought (an idea or\nmind). In fact, he insists, \u201ca mode of extension and the idea of\nthat mode are one and the same thing, but expressed in two ways\u201d\n(IIp7s). Because of the fundamental and underlying unity of Nature or\nSubstance and its attributes, thought and extension are just two\ndifferent ways in which one and the same Nature expresses itself.\nEvery material thing (every determinate expression of Nature through\nextension) thus has its own particular idea (a determinate expression\nof Nature through thought)\u2014an eternal adequate idea\u2014that\ncorresponds to and represents it. Since that idea is just a mode of\none of God\u2019s attributes\u2014thought\u2014it is in God, and\nthe infinite series of ideas constitutes God\u2019s mind or infinite\nintellect. As he explains,\n\nA circle existing in nature and the idea of the existing circle, which\nis also in God, are one and the same thing, which is explained through\ndifferent attributes. Therefore, whether we conceive nature under the\nattribute of Extension, or under the attribute of Thought, or under\nany other attribute, we shall find one and the same order, or one and\nthe same connection of causes, i.e., that the same things follow one\nanother. (IIp7s)\n\n\nIt follows from this, Spinoza argues, that the causal relations\nbetween bodies is mirrored in the logical relations between\nGod\u2019s ideas. Or, as Spinoza notes in Proposition Seven,\n\u201cthe order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and\nconnection of things\u201d.\n\nOne kind of extended body, however, is significantly more complex than\nany others in its composition and in its dispositions to act and be\nacted upon. That complexity is reflected in its corresponding idea.\nThe body in question is the human body; and its corresponding idea is\nthe human mind or soul. The human mind, then, like any other idea, is\nsimply one particular mode of God\u2019s attribute, thought. Whatever\nhappens in the body is reflected or expressed in the mind. In this\nway, the mind perceives, more or less obscurely, what is taking place\nin its body. And through its body\u2019s interactions with other\nbodies, the mind is aware of what is happening in the physical world\naround it. But the human mind no more interacts with its body than any\nmode of thought interacts with a mode of extension.\n\nOne of the pressing questions in seventeenth-century philosophy, and\nperhaps the most celebrated legacy of Descartes\u2019s dualism, is\nthe problem of how two radically different substances such as mind and\nbody enter into a union in a human being and cause effects in each\nother. How can the extended body causally engage the unextended mind,\nwhich is incapable of contact or motion, and \u201cmove\u201d it,\nthat is, cause mental effects such as pains, sensations and\nperceptions? And how can an immaterial thing like a mind or soul,\nwhich does not have motion, put a body (the human body) into motion?\nSpinoza, in effect, denies that the human being is a union of two\nsubstances. The human mind and the human body are two\ndifferent expressions\u2014under thought and under extension\u2014of\none and the same thing: the person. And because there is no causal\ninteraction between the mind and the body, the so-called mind-body\nproblem does not, technically speaking, arise.\n2.3 Knowledge\n\nThe human mind, like God, contains ideas. Some of these\nideas\u2014sensory images, qualitative \u201cfeels\u201d (like\npains and pleasures), perceptual data\u2014, and figments of the\nimagination are imprecise qualitative phenomena, being the expression\nin thought of states of the body as it is affected by the bodies\nsurrounding it. Such ideas do not convey adequate and true knowledge\nof the world, but only a relative, partial and subjective picture of\nhow things presently seem to be to the perceiver. There is no\nsystematic order to these perceptions, nor any critical oversight by\nreason. \u201cAs long as the human Mind perceives things from the\ncommon order of nature, it does not have an adequate, but only a\nconfused and mutilated knowledge of itself, of its own Body, and of\nexternal bodies\u201d (IIp29c). Under such circumstances, we are\nsimply determined in our ideas by our fortuitous and haphazard\nencounter with things in the external world. This superficial\nacquaintance will never provide us with knowledge of the essences of\nthose things. In fact, it is an invariable source of falsehood and\nerror. This \u201cknowledge from random experience\u201d is also the\norigin of great delusions, since we\u2014thinking ourselves\nfree\u2014are, in our ignorance, unaware of just how we are\ndetermined by causes.\n\nAdequate ideas, on the other hand, are formed in a rational and\norderly manner, and are necessarily true and revelatory of the\nessences of things. \u201cReason\u201d, the second kind of knowledge\n(after \u201crandom experience\u201d), is the apprehension of the\nessence of a thing through a discursive, inferential procedure.\n\u201cA true idea means nothing other than knowing a thing perfectly,\nor in the best way\u201d(IIp43s). It involves grasping a\nthing\u2019s causal and conceptual connections not just to other\nobjects but, more importantly, to the attributes of God, the infinite\nmodes (the laws of nature) that follow immediately from them, and the\n\u201ccommon notions\u201d that pick out features present in all\nmodes of an attribute. The adequate idea of a thing clearly and\ndistinctly situates its object in all of its causal nexuses and\nconceptual relations, and shows not just that it is, but\nwhat it is and how and why it is. The\nperson who truly knows a thing sees the reasons why the thing was\ndetermined to be and could not have been otherwise. \u201cIt is of\nthe nature of Reason to regard things as necessary, not as\ncontingent\u201d (IIp44). The belief that some thing is accidental or\nspontaneous can be based only on an inadequate grasp of the\nthing\u2019s causal explanation, on a partial and\n\u201cmutilated\u201d familiarity with it. To perceive by way of\nadequate ideas is to perceive the necessity inherent in Nature.\n\nSense experience alone could never provide the information conveyed by\nan adequate idea. The senses present things only as they appear from a\ngiven perspective at a given moment in time. An adequate idea, on the\nother hand, by showing how a thing follows necessarily from one or\nanother of God\u2019s attributes, presents it in its\n\u201ceternal\u201d aspects\u2014sub specie aeternitatis,\nas Spinoza puts it\u2014without any relation to time. \u201cIt is of\nthe nature of Reason to regard things as necessary and not as\ncontingent. And Reason perceives this necessity of things truly, i.e.,\nas it is in itself. But this necessity of things is the very necessity\nof God\u2019s eternal nature. Therefore, it is of the nature of\nReason to regard things under this species of eternity\u201d (IIp44).\nThe third kind of knowledge, intuition, takes what is known by Reason\nand grasps it in a single, perspicacious act of the mind.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s conception of adequate knowledge reveals an unrivaled\noptimism in the cognitive powers of the human being. Not even\nDescartes believed that we could know all of Nature and its innermost\nsecrets with the degree of depth and certainty that Spinoza thought\npossible. Most remarkably, because Spinoza thought that the adequate\nknowledge of any object, and of Nature as a whole, involves a\nknowledge of God\u2019s essence and of how things relate to God and\nits attributes, he also had no scruples about claiming that we can, at\nleast in principle, know God perfectly and adequately. \u201cThe\nknowledge of God\u2019s eternal and infinite essence that each idea\ninvolves is adequate and perfect\u201d (IIp46). \u201cThe human Mind\nhas an adequate knowledge of God\u2019s eternal and infinite\nessence\u201d (IIp47). No other philosopher in history has been\nwilling to make this claim. But, then again, no other philosopher so\nforthrightly identified God with Nature.\n2.4 Passion and Action\n\nSpinoza engages in such a detailed analysis of the composition of the\nhuman being because it is essential to his goal of showing how the\nhuman being is a part of Nature, existing within the same\ndeterministic causal nexuses as other extended and mental beings. This\nhas serious ethical implications. First, it implies that a human being\nis not endowed with freedom, at least in the ordinary sense of that\nterm. Because our minds and the events in our minds are simply ideas\nthat exist within the causal series of ideas that follows from\nGod\u2019s attribute of thought, our actions and volitions are as\nnecessarily determined as any other natural events. \u201cIn the Mind\nthere is no absolute, or free, will, but the Mind is determined to\nwill this or that by a cause that is also determined by another, and\nthis again by another, and so to infinity\u201d (IIp48).\n\nWhat is true of the will (and, of course, of our bodies) is true of\nall the phenomena of our psychological lives. Spinoza believes that\nthis is something that has not been sufficiently understood by\nprevious thinkers, who seem to have wanted to place the human being on\na pedestal outside of (or above) nature.\n\nMost of those who have written about the Affects, and men\u2019s way\nof living, seem to treat, not of natural things, which follow the\ncommon laws of nature, but of things that are outside nature. Indeed\nthey seem to conceive man in nature as a dominion within a dominion.\nFor they believe that man disturbs, rather than follows, the order of\nnature, that he has absolute power over his actions, and that he is\ndetermined only by himself. (III, Preface)\n\n\nDescartes, for example, believed that if the freedom of the human\nbeing is to be preserved, the soul must be exempt from the kind of\ndeterministic laws that rule over the material universe.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s aim in Parts Three and Four is, as he says in his\nPreface to Part Three, to restore the human being and his volitional\nand emotional life to their proper place in nature. For nothing stands\noutside of nature, not even the human mind.\n\nNature is always the same, and its virtue and power of acting are\neverywhere one and the same, i.e., the laws and rules of nature,\naccording to which all things happen, and change from one form to\nanother, are always and everywhere the same. So the way of\nunderstanding the nature of anything, of whatever kind, must also be\nthe same, viz. through the universal laws and rules of nature.\n\n\nOur affects\u2014our love, anger, hate, envy, pride, jealousy,\netc.\u2014\u201cfollow from the same necessity and force of nature\nas the other singular things\u201d. Spinoza, therefore, explains\nthese emotions\u2014as determined in their occurrence as are a body\nin motion and the properties of a mathematical figure\u2014just as he\nwould explain any other things in nature. \u201cI shall treat the\nnature and power of the Affects, and the power of the Mind over them,\nby the same Method by which, in the preceding parts, I treated God and\nthe Mind, and I shall consider human actions and appetites just as if\nit were a Question of lines, planes, and bodies.\u201d\n\nOur affects are divided into actions and passions. When the cause of\nan event lies wholly in our own nature\u2014more particularly, our\nknowledge or adequate ideas\u2014 and we are the \u201cadequate\ncause\u201d of it, then it is a case of the mind acting. On the other\nhand, when something happens in us the cause of which lies outside of\nour nature, then we are passive and being acted upon. Usually what\ntakes place, both when we are acting and when we are being acted upon,\nis some change in our mental and physical capacities, what Spinoza\ncalls \u201can increase or decrease in our power of acting\u201d or\nin our \u201cpower to persevere in being\u201d. All beings are\nnaturally endowed with such a power or striving. This\nconatus, a kind of existential inertia, constitutes the\n\u201cessence\u201d of any being. \u201cEach thing, as far as it\ncan by its own power, strives to persevere in its being.\u201d An\naffect just is any change in this power, for better or for\nworse. Affects that are actions are changes in this power that have\ntheir source (or adequate cause) in our nature alone; affects that are\npassions are those changes in this power that originate at least\npartly outside of us.\n\nWhat we should strive for is to learn how to moderate and restrain the\npassions and become active, autonomous beings. If we can achieve this,\nthen we will be \u201cfree\u201d to the extent that whatever happens\nto us will result not from our relations with things outside us, but\nfrom our own nature (as that follows from, and is ultimately and\nnecessarily determined by, the attributes of God of which our minds\nand bodies are modes). We will, consequently, be truly liberated from\nthe troublesome emotional ups and downs of this life. The way to bring\nthis about is to increase our knowledge, our store of adequate ideas,\nand reduce as far as possible the power or strength of our inadequate\nideas, which follow not from the nature of the mind alone but from its\nbeing an expression of how our body is affected by other bodies. In\nother words, we need to free ourselves from a reliance on the senses\nand the imagination, since a life guided by the senses and the\nimagination is a life being affected and led by the objects around us,\nand rely as much as we can only on our rational faculties.\n\nBecause of our innate striving to persevere\u2014which, in the human\nbeing, is called \u201cwill\u201d or \u201cappetite\u201d\u2014we\nnaturally pursue those things that we believe will benefit us by\nincreasing our power of acting and shun or flee those things that we\nbelieve will harm us by decreasing our power of acting. This provides\nSpinoza with a foundation for cataloging the human passions. For the\npassions are all functions of the ways in which external things affect\nour powers or capacities. Joy (Laetitiae, sometimes\ntranslated as \u201cpleasure\u201d), for example, is simply the\nmovement or passage to a greater capacity for action. \u201cBy Joy\n\u2026 I shall understand that passion by which the Mind passes to a\ngreater perfection\u201d (IIIp11s). When joy is a passion, it is\nalways brought about by some external object. Sadness\n(Tristitiae, or \u201cpain\u201d), on the other hand, is\nthe passage to a lesser state of perfection, also occasioned by a\nthing outside us. Love is simply Joy accompanied by an awareness of\nthe external cause that brings about the passage to a greater\nperfection. We love that object that benefits us and causes us joy.\nHate is nothing but \u201csadness with the accompanying idea of an\nexternal cause\u201d. Hope is simply \u201can inconstant joy which\nhas arisen from the image of a future or past thing whose outcome we\ndoubt\u201d. We hope for a thing whose presence, as yet uncertain,\nwill bring about joy. We fear, however, a thing whose presence,\nequally uncertain, will bring about sadness. When that whose outcome\nwas doubtful becomes certain, hope is changed into confidence, while\nfear is changed into despair.\n\nAll of the human emotions, in so far as they are passions, are\nconstantly directed outward, towards things and their capacities to\naffect us one way or another. Aroused by our passions and desires, we\nseek or flee those things that we believe cause joy or sadness.\n\u201cWe strive to further the occurrence of whatever we imagine will\nlead to Joy, and to avert or destroy what we imagine is contrary to\nit, or will lead to Sadness.\u201d Our hopes and fears fluctuate\ndepending on whether we regard the objects of our desires or aversions\nas remote, near, necessary, possible or unlikely. But the objects of\nour passions, being external to us, are completely beyond our control.\nThus, the more we allow ourselves to be controlled by them,\nthe more we are subject to passions and the less active and free we\nare. The upshot is a fairly pathetic picture of a life mired in the\npassions and pursuing and fleeing the changeable and fleeting objects\nthat occasion them: \u201cWe are driven about in many ways by\nexternal causes, and \u2026 like waves on the sea, driven by\ncontrary winds, we toss about, not knowing our outcome and fate\u201d\n(IIIp59s). The title for Part Four of the Ethics reveals with\nperfect clarity Spinoza\u2019s evaluation of such a life for a human\nbeing: \u201cOn Human Bondage, or the Powers of the Affects\u201d.\nHe explains that the human being\u2019s \u201clack of power to\nmoderate and restrain the affects I call Bondage. For the man who is\nsubject to affects is under the control, not of himself, but of\nfortune, in whose power he so greatly is that often, though he sees\nthe better for himself, he is still forced to follow the worse\u201d.\nIt is, he says, a kind of \u201csickness of the mind\u201d to suffer\ntoo much love for a thing \u201cthat is liable to many variations and\nthat we can never fully possess.\u201d\n2.5 Virtue and Happiness\n\nThe solution to this predicament is an ancient one. Since we cannot\ncontrol the objects that we tend to value and that we allow to\ninfluence our well-being, we ought instead to try to control our\nevaluations themselves and thereby minimize the sway that external\nobjects and the passions have over us. We can never eliminate the\npassive affects entirely. We are essentially a part of nature, and can\nnever fully remove ourselves from the causal series that link us to\nexternal things. But we can, ultimately, counteract the passions,\ncontrol them, and achieve a certain degree of relief from their\nturmoil.\n\nThe path to restraining and moderating the affects is through virtue.\nSpinoza is a psychological and ethical egoist. All beings naturally\nseek their own advantage\u2014to preserve their own being and\nincrease their power\u2014and it is right for them do so. This is\nwhat virtue consists in. Since we are thinking beings, endowed with\nintelligence and reason, what is to our greatest advantage is\nknowledge. Our virtue, therefore, consists in the pursuit of knowledge\nand understanding, of adequate ideas. The best kind of knowledge is a\npurely intellectual intuition of the essences of things. This\n\u201cthird kind of knowledge\u201d\u2014beyond both random\nexperience and ratiocination\u2014sees things not in their temporal\ndimension, not in their durational existence and in relation to other\nparticular things, but under the aspect of eternity (sub specie\naeternitatis), that is, abstracted from all considerations of\ntime and place and situated in their relationship to God and its\nattributes. They are apprehended, that is, in their conceptual and\ncausal relationship to the universal essences (thought and extension)\nand the eternal laws of nature.\n\nWe conceive things as actual in two ways: either insofar as we\nconceive them to exist in relation to a certain time and place, or\ninsofar as we conceive them to be contained in God and to follow from\nthe necessity of the divine nature. But the things we conceive in this\nsecond way as true, or real, we conceive under a species of eternity,\nand to that extent they involve the eternal and infinite essence of\nGod. (Vp29s)\n\n\nBut this is just to say that, ultimately, we strive for a knowledge of\nGod. The concept of any body involves the concept of extension; and\nthe concept of any idea or mind involves the concept of thought. But\nthought and extension just are God\u2019s attributes. So the proper\nand adequate conception of any body or mind necessarily involves the\nconcept or knowledge of God. \u201cThe third kind of knowledge\nproceeds from an adequate idea of certain attributes of God to an\nadequate knowledge of the essence of things, and the more we\nunderstand things in this way, the more we understand God\u201d\n(Vp25d). Knowledge of God is, thus, the mind\u2019s greatest good and\nits greatest virtue.\n\nWhat we see when we understand things through the third kind of\nknowledge, under the aspect of eternity and in relation to God, is the\ndeterministic necessity of all things. We see that all bodies and\ntheir states follow necessarily from the essence of matter and the\nuniversal laws of physics; and we see that all ideas, including all\nthe properties of minds, follow necessarily from the essence of\nthought and its universal laws. This insight can only weaken the power\nthat the passions have over us. We are no longer hopeful or fearful of\nwhat shall come to pass, and no longer anxious or despondent over our\npossessions. We regard all things with equanimity, and we are not\ninordinately and irrationally affected in different ways by past,\npresent or future events. The result is self-control and a calmness of\nmind.\n\nThe more this knowledge that things are necessary is concerned with\nsingular things, which we imagine more distinctly and vividly, the\ngreater is this power of the Mind over the affects, as experience\nitself also testifies. For we see that Sadness over some good which\nhas perished is lessened as soon as the man who has lost it realizes\nthat this good could not, in any way, have been kept. Similarly, we\nsee that [because we regard infancy as a natural and necessary thing],\nno one pities infants because of their inability to speak, to walk, or\nto reason, or because they live so many years, as it were, unconscious\nof themselves. (Vp6s)\n\n\nOur affects or emotions themselves can be understood in this way,\nwhich further diminishes their power over us.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s ethical theory is, to a certain degree, Stoic, and\nrecalls the doctrines of thinkers such as Cicero and Seneca:\n\nWe do not have an absolute power to adapt things outside us to our\nuse. Nevertheless, we shall bear calmly those things that happen to us\ncontrary to what the principle of our advantage demands, if we are\nconscious that we have done our duty, that the power we have could not\nhave extended itself to the point where we could have avoided those\nthings, and that we are a part of the whole of nature, whose order we\nfollow. If we understand this clearly and distinctly, that part of us\nwhich is defined by understanding, i.e., the better part of us, will\nbe entirely satisfied with this, and will strive to persevere in that\nsatisfaction. For insofar as we understand, we can want nothing except\nwhat is necessary, nor absolutely be satisfied with anything except\nwhat is true. (IV, Appendix)\n\n\nWhat, in the end, replaces the passionate love for ephemeral\n\u201cgoods\u201d is an intellectual love for an eternal, immutable\ngood that we can fully and stably possess, God. The third kind of\nknowledge generates a love for its object, and in this love consists\nnot a passionate joy but an active one, even blessedness itself.\nTaking his cue from Maimonides\u2019s view of human\neudaimonia, Spinoza argues that the mind\u2019s intellectual\nlove of God is our understanding of the universe, our virtue,\nour happiness, our well-being and our \u201csalvation\u201d. It is\nalso our freedom and autonomy, as we approach the condition wherein\nwhat happens to us follows from our nature (as a determinate and\ndetermined mode of one of God\u2019s attributes) alone and not as a\nresult of the ways external things affect us. Spinoza\u2019s\n\u201cfree person\u201d is one who bears the gifts and losses of\nfortune with equanimity and does only those things that he believes to\nbe \u201cthe most important in life\u201d. He also, despite the\nfundamental egoism, engages in behavior toward others that is\ntypically regarded as \u201cethical\u201d, even altruistic. He takes\ncare for the well-being and virtuous flourishing of other human\nbeings. He does what he can through rational benevolence (as opposed\nto pity or some other passion) to insure that they, too, achieve\nrelief from the disturbances of the passions through understanding,\nand thus that they become more like him (and therefore most useful to\nhim). He does this not from altruistic motives but egoistic ones: he\nsees that it is in his own best interest to be in communion with other\nrationally virtuous individuals. Moreover, the free person is not\nanxious about death. The free person neither hopes for any eternal,\notherworldly rewards nor fears any eternal punishments. He knows that\nthe soul is not immortal in any personal sense, but is endowed only\nwith a certain kind of eternity. The more the mind consists of true\nand adequate ideas (which are eternal), the more of it\nremains\u2014within God\u2019s attribute of thought\u2014after the\ndeath of the body and the disappearance of that part of the mind that\ncorresponds to the body\u2019s duration. This understanding of his\nplace in the natural scheme of things brings to the free individual\ntrue peace of mind, even salvation.\n\nThere are a number of social and political ramifications that follow\nfrom Spinoza\u2019s ethical doctrines of human action and well-being.\nBecause disagreement and discord between human beings is always the\nresult of our different and changeable passions, \u201cfree\u201d\nindividuals\u2014who all share the same nature and act on the same\nprinciples\u2014will naturally and effortlessly form a harmonious\nsociety. \u201cInsofar as men are torn by affects that are passions,\nthey can be contrary to one another \u2026[But] insofar as men live\naccording to the guidance of reason, they must do only those things\nthat are good for human nature, and hence, for each man, i.e., those\nthings that agree with the nature of each man. Hence, insofar as men\nlive according to the guidance of reason, they must always agree among\nthemselves\u201d (IVp34\u201335). Free human beings will be mutually\nbeneficial and useful, and will be tolerant of the opinions and even\nthe errors of others. However, human beings do not generally live\nunder the guidance of reason. The state or sovereign, therefore, is\nrequired in order to insure\u2014not by reason, but by the threat of\nforce\u2014that individuals are protected from the unrestrained\npursuit of self-interest on the part of other individuals. The\ntransition from a state of nature, where each seeks his own advantage\nwithout limitation, to a civil state involves the universal\nrenunciation of certain natural rights\u2014such as \u201cthe right\neveryone has of avenging himself, and of judging good and\nevil\u201d\u2014and the investment of those prerogatives in a\ncentral authority. As long as human beings are guided by their\npassions, the state is necessary to bring it about that they\n\u201clive harmoniously and be of assistance to one\nanother\u201d.\n3. Theological-Political Treatise\n\nThe ostensive aim of the Theological-Political Treatise\n(TTP), widely vilified in its time, is, as its subtitle proclaims, to\nshow that \u201cthe freedom to philosophize can not only be granted\nwithout injury to piety and the peace of the Commonwealth, but that\nthe peace of the Commonwealth and Piety are endangered by the\nsuppression of this freedom.\u201d But Spinoza\u2019s ultimate\nintention is reveal the truth about Scripture and religion, and\nthereby to undercut the political power exercised in modern states by\nreligious authorities. He also defends, at least as a political ideal,\nthe tolerant, secular, and democratic polity.\n3.1 On Religion and Scripture\n\nSpinoza begins the TTP by alerting his readers, through a kind of\n\u201cnatural history of religion\u201d, to just those superstitious\nbeliefs and behaviors that clergy, by playing on ordinary human\nemotions, encourage in their followers. A person guided by fear and\nhope, the main emotions in a life devoted to the pursuit of temporal\nadvantages, turns, in the face of the vagaries of fortune, to\nbehaviors calculated to secure the goods he desires. Thus, we pray,\nworship, make votive offerings, sacrifice and engage in all the\nvarious rituals of popular religion. But the emotions are as fleeting\nas the objects that occasion them, and thus the superstitions grounded\nin those emotions subject to fluctuations. Ambitious and self-serving\nclergy do their best to stabilize this situation and give some\npermanence to those beliefs and behaviors. \u201cImmense efforts have\nbeen made to invest religion, true or false, with such pomp and\nceremony that it can sustain any shock and constantly evoke the\ndeepest reverence in all its worshippers\u201d (TTP, Preface, G\nIII.6\u20137/S 2\u20133). Religious leaders are generally abetted in\ntheir purposes by the civil authority, which threatens to punish all\ndeviations from theological orthodoxy as \u201csedition\u201d. The\nresult is a state religion that has no rational foundations, a mere\n\u201crespect for ecclesiastics\u201d that involves adulation and\nmysteries but no true worship of God.\n\nThe solution to this state of affairs, Spinoza believes, is to examine\nthe Bible anew and find the doctrines of the \u201ctrue\nreligion\u201d. Only then will we be able to delimit exactly what we\nneed to do to show proper respect for God and obtain blessedness. This\nwill reduce the sway that religious authorities have over our\nemotional, intellectual and physical lives, and reinstate a proper and\nhealthy relationship between the state and religion. A close analysis\nof the Bible is particularly important for any argument that the\nfreedom of philosophizing\u2014essentially, freedom of thought and\nspeech\u2014is not prejudicial to piety. If it can be demonstrated\nthat Scripture is not a source of \u201cnatural truth\u201d, but the\nbearer of only a simple moral message (\u201cLove your\nneighbor\u201d), then people will see that \u201cfaith is something\nseparate from philosophy\u201d. Spinoza intends to show that in that\nmoral message alone\u2014and not in Scripture\u2019s words, origin\nor history\u2014lies the sacredness of what is otherwise merely a\nhuman document. The Bible teaches only \u201cobedience [to\nGod]\u201d, not knowledge. Thus, philosophy and religion, reason and\nfaith, inhabit two distinct and exclusive spheres, and neither should\ntread in the domain of the other. The freedom to philosophize and\nspeculate can therefore be granted without any harm to true religion.\nIn fact, such freedom is essential to public peace and piety, since\nmost civil disturbances arise from sectarian disputes. The real danger\nto a republic comes from those who would worship not God, but some\nwords on a page: \u201cIt will be said that, although God\u2019s law\nis inscribed in our hearts, Scripture is nevertheless the Word of God,\nand it is no more permissible to say of Scripture that it is mutilated\nand contaminated than to say this of God\u2019s Word. In reply, I\nhave to say that such objectors are carrying their piety too far, and\nare turning religion into superstition; indeed, instead of God\u2019s\nWord they are beginning to worship likenesses and images, that is,\npaper and ink\u201d (TTP, chap. 12, G III.159/S 145\u20136).\n\nFrom a proper and informed reading of Scripture, a number of things\nbecome clear. First, the prophets were not men of exceptional\nintellectual talents\u2014they were not, that is, naturally gifted\nphilosophers\u2014but simply very pious, even morally superior\nindividuals endowed with vivid imaginations. They were able to\nperceive God\u2019s revelation through their imaginative faculties\nvia words or real or imaginary figures. This is what allowed them to\napprehend that which lies beyond the boundary of the intellect.\nMoreover, the content of a prophecy varied according to the physical\ntemperament, imaginative powers, and particular opinions or prejudices\nof the prophet. It follows that prophecy, while it has its origins in\nthe power of God\u2014and in this respect it is, in Spinoza\u2019s\nmetaphysical scheme, no different from any other natural\nevent\u2014does not provide privileged knowledge of natural or\nspiritual phenomena. The prophets are not necessarily to be trusted\nwhen it comes to matters of the intellect, on questions of philosophy,\nhistory or science; and their pronouncements set no parameters on what\nshould or should not be believed about the natural world on the basis\nof our rational faculties.\n\nSpinoza provides an equally deflationary account of God\u2019s\nelection, or the \u201cvocation\u201d, of the Hebrews. It is\n\u201cchildish\u201d, he insists, for anyone to base their happiness\non the uniqueness of their gifts; in the case of the Jews, it would be\nthe uniqueness of their being chosen among all people. The ancient\nHebrews, in fact, did not surpass other nations in their wisdom or in\ntheir proximity to God. They were neither intellectually nor morally\nsuperior to other peoples. They were \u201cchosen\u201d only with\nrespect to their social organization and political good fortune. God\nor Nature gave them a set of laws (through a wise lawgiver, Moses),\nwhich they obeyed, and made their surrounding enemies weaker than\nthem. The natural result of this \u201cinternal\u201d and\n\u201cexternal\u201d aid is that their society was well-ordered and\ntheir autonomous government persisted for a long time. Their election\nwas thus a temporal and conditional one, and their kingdom is now long\ngone. Thus, \u201cat the present time there is nothing whatsoever\nthat the Jews can arrogate to themselves above other nations\u201d\n(TTP, chap. 3, G III.56/S 45). Spinoza thereby rejects the\nparticularism that many\u2014including Amsterdam\u2019s Sephardic\nrabbis\u2014insisted was essential to Judaism. True piety and\nblessedness are universal in their scope and accessible to anyone,\nregardless of their confessional creed.\n\nCentral to Spinoza\u2019s analysis of the Jewish\nreligion\u2014although it is applicable to any religion\nwhatsoever\u2014is the distinction between the divine law and the\nceremonial law. The law of God commands only the knowledge and love of\nGod and the actions required for attaining that condition. Such love\nmust arise not from fear of possible penalties or hope for any\nrewards, but solely from the goodness of its object. The divine law\ndoes not demand any particular rites or ceremonies such as\nsacrifices or dietary restrictions or festival observances. The six\nhundred and thirteen precepts of the Torah have nothing to do with\nblessedness or virtue. They were directed only at the Hebrews so that\nthey might govern themselves in an autonomous state. The ceremonial\nlaws helped preserve their kingdom and insure its prosperity, but were\nvalid only as long as that political entity lasted. They are not\nbinding on all Jews under all circumstances. They were, in fact,\ninstituted by Moses for a purely practical reason: so that people\nmight do their duty and not go their own way. This is true not just of\nthe rites and practices of Judaism, but of the outer ceremonies of all\nreligions. None of these activities have anything to do with true\nhappiness or piety. They serve only to control people\u2019s behavior\nand preserve a particular society.\n\nA similar practical function is served by stories of miracles.\nScripture speaks in a language suited to affect the imagination of\nordinary people and compel their obedience. Rather than appealing to\nthe natural and real causes of all events, its authors sometimes\nnarrate things in a way calculated to move people\u2014particularly\nuneducated people\u2014to devotion. \u201cIf Scripture were to\ndescribe the downfall of an empire in the style adopted by political\nhistorians, the common people would not be stirred \u2026\u201d\nStrictly speaking, however, miracles\u2014understood as divinely\ncaused departures from the ordinary course of nature\u2014are\nimpossible. Every event, no matter how extraordinary, has a natural\ncause and explanation. \u201cNothing happens in nature that does not\nfollow from her laws\u201d (TTP, chap. 6, G III.83/S 73). This is\nsimply a consequence of Spinoza\u2019s metaphysical doctrines.\nMiracles as traditionally conceived require a distinction between God\nand nature, something that Spinoza\u2019s philosophy rules out in\nprinciple. Moreover, nature\u2019s order is inviolable in so far as\nthe sequence of events in nature is a necessary consequence of\nGod\u2019s attributes. There certainly are \u201cmiracles\u201d in\nthe sense of events whose natural causes are unknown to us, and which\nwe therefore attribute to the powers of a supernatural God. But this\nis, once again, to retreat to superstition, \u201cthe bitter enemy of\nall true knowledge and true morality\u201d.\n\nBy analyzing prophecy in terms of vividness of imagination, Jewish\nelection as political fortune, the ceremonial law as a kind of social\nand political expediency, and the belief in miracles as an ignorance\nof nature\u2019s necessary causal operations, Spinoza naturalizes\n(and, consequently, demystifies) some of the fundamental elements of\nJudaism and other religions and undermines the foundations of their\nexternal, superstitious rites. At the same time, he thereby reduces\nthe fundamental doctrine of piety to a simple and universal formula,\nnaturalistic in itself, involving love and knowledge. This process of\nnaturalization achieves its stunning climax when Spinoza turns to\nconsider the authorship and interpretation of the Bible itself.\nSpinoza\u2019s views on Scripture constitute, without question, the\nmost radical theses of the Treatise, and explain why he was\nattacked with such vitriol by his contemporaries. Others before\nSpinoza had suggested that Moses was not the author of the entire\nPentateuch (for example, Abraham ibn Ezra in the twelfth century and,\nin the seventeenth century, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes).\nBut no one had taken that claim to the extreme limit that Spinoza did,\narguing for it with such boldness and at such length. Nor had anyone\nbefore Spinoza been willing to draw from it the conclusions about the\nstatus, meaning and interpretation of Scripture that Spinoza drew.\n\nSpinoza denied that Moses wrote all, or even most of the Torah. The\nreferences in the Pentateuch to Moses in the third person; the\nnarration of his death and, particularly, of events following his\ndeath; and the fact that some places are called by names that they did\nnot bear in the time of Moses all \u201cmake it clear beyond a shadow\nof doubt\u201d that the writings commonly referred to as \u201cthe\nFive Books of Moses\u201d were, in fact, written by someone who lived\nmany generations after Moses. Moses did, to be sure, compose some\nbooks of history and of law; and remnants of those long lost books can\nbe found in the Pentateuch. But the Torah as we have it, as well as as\nother books of the Hebrew Bible (such as Joshua, Judges, Samuel and\nKings) were written neither by the individuals whose names they bear\nnor by any person appearing in them. Spinoza believes that these were,\nin fact, all composed by a single historian living many generations\nafter the events narrated, and that this was most likely Ezra the\nScribe. It was the post-exilic leader who took the many writings that\nhad come down to him and began weaving them into a single (but not\nseamless) narrative. Ezra\u2019s work was later completed and\nsupplemented by the editorial labors of others. What we now possess,\nthen, is nothing but a compilation, and a rather mismanaged, haphazard\nand \u201cmutilated\u201d one at that.\n\nAs for the books of the Prophets, they are of even later provenance,\ncompiled (or \u201cheaped together\u201d, in Spinoza\u2019s view)\nby a chronicler or scribe perhaps as late as the Second Temple period.\nCanonization into Scripture occurred only in the second century BCE,\nwhen the Pharisees selected a number of texts from a multitude of\nothers. Because the process of transmission was a historical one,\ninvolving the conveyance of writings of human origin over a long\nperiod of time through numerous scribes, and because the decision to\ninclude some books but not others was made by fallible human beings,\nthere are good reasons for believing that a significant portion of the\ntext of the \u201cOld Testament\u201d is corrupt.\n\nWhile in 1670 there was nothing novel in claiming that Moses did not\nwrite all of the Torah, Spinoza\u2019s remarkably innovative claim\nwas to argue that this holds great significance for how Scripture is\nto be read and interpreted. He was dismayed by the way in which\nScripture itself was worshipped, by the reverence accorded to the\nwords on the page rather than to the message they conveyed. If the\nBible is an historical (i.e., natural) document, then it should be\ntreated like any other work of nature. The study of Scripture, or\nBiblical hermeneutics, should therefore proceed as the study of\nnature, or natural science, proceeds: by gathering and evaluating\nempirical data, that is, by examining the \u201cbook\u201d\nitself\u2014along with the contextual conditions of its\ncomposition\u2014for its general principles.\n\nI hold that the method of interpreting Scripture is no different from\nthe method of interpreting Nature, and is in fact in complete accord\nwith it. For the method of interpreting Nature consists essentially in\ncomposing a detailed study of Nature from which, as being the source\nof our assured data, we can deduce the definitions of the things of\nNature. Now in exactly the same way the task of Scriptural\ninterpretation requires us to make a straightforward study of\nScripture, and from this, as the source of our fixed data and\nprinciples, to deduce by logical inference the meaning of the authors\nof Scripture. In this way\u2014that is, by allowing no other\nprinciples or data for the interpretation of Scripture and study of\nits contents except those that can be gathered only from Scripture\nitself and from a historical study of Scripture\u2014steady progress\ncan be made without any danger of error, and one can deal with matters\nthat surpass our understanding with no less confidence than those\nmatters that are known to us by the natural light of reason. (TTP,\nchap. 7, G III.98/S 87).\n\n\nJust as the knowledge of nature must be sought from nature alone, so\nmust the knowledge of Scripture\u2014an apprehension of its intended\nmeaning\u2014be sought from Scripture alone and through the\nappropriate exercise of rational and textual inquiry.\n\nWhen properly interpreted, the universal message conveyed by Scripture\nis a simple moral one: \u201cTo know and love God, and to love\none\u2019s neighbor as oneself\u201d. This is the real word\nof God and the foundation of true piety, and it lies uncorrupted in a\nfaulty, tampered and corrupt text. The lesson involves no metaphysical\ndoctrines about God or nature, and requires no sophisticated training\nin philosophy. In contrast with Maimonides\u2019 account, Spinoza\ninsists that the object of Scripture is not to impart truth or\nknowledge, but to compel obedience and regulate our conduct.\n\u201cScriptural doctrine contains not abstruse speculation or\nphilosophic reasoning, but very simple matters able to be understood\nby the most sluggish mind\u201d (TTP, chap. 13, G III.167/S 153). To\nthe extent (and only to the extent) that Scripture is successful in\nmorally edifying its readers and inspiring them to obey the word of\nGod and treat others with justice and charity, it is\n\u201cdivine\u201d. Spinoza claims, in fact, that a familiarity with\nScripture is not even necessary for piety and blessedness, since its\nmessage can be known by our rational faculties alone, although with\ngreat difficulty for most people. \u201cHe who, while unacquainted\nwith these writings, nevertheless knows by the natural light that\nthere is a God having the attributes we have recounted, and who also\npursues a true way of life, is altogether blessed.\u201d\n\nIt follows that the only practical commandments that properly belong\nto religion are those that are necessary to carry out the moral\nprecept and \u201cconfirm in our hearts the love of our\nneighbor\u201d. \u201cA catholic faith should therefore contain only\nthose dogmas which obedience to God absolutely demands, and without\nwhich such obedience is absolutely impossible \u2026 these must all\nbe directed to this one end: that there is a Supreme Being who loves\njustice and charity, whom all must obey in order to be saved, and must\nworship by practicing justice and charity to their neighbor\u201d\n(TTP, chap. 14, G III.177/S 161\u20132). As for other dogmas,\n\u201cevery person should embrace those that he, being the best judge\nof himself, feels will do most to strengthen in him love of\njustice\u201d.\n\nThis is the heart of Spinoza\u2019s case for toleration, for freedom\nof philosophizing and freedom of religious expression. By reducing the\ncentral message of Scripture\u2014and the essential content of\npiety\u2014to a simple moral maxim, one that is free of any\nsuperfluous speculative doctrines or ceremonial practices; and by\nfreeing Scripture of the burden of having to communicate specific\nphilosophical truths or of prescribing (or proscribing) a multitude of\nrequired behaviors, he has demonstrated both that philosophy is\nindependent from religion and that the liberty of each individual to\ninterpret religion as he wishes can be upheld without any detriment to\npiety.\n\nAs to the question of what God, the exemplar of true life, really is,\nwhether he is fire, or spirit, or light, or thought, or something\nelse, this is irrelevant to faith. And so likewise is the question as\nto why he is the exemplar of true life, whether this is because he has\na just and merciful disposition, or because all things exist and act\nthrough him and consequently we, too, understand through him, and\nthrough him we see what is true, just and good. On these questions it\nmatters not what beliefs a man holds. Nor, again, does it matter for\nfaith whether one believes that God is omnipresent in essence or in\npotency, whether he directs everything from free will or from the\nnecessity of his nature, whether he lays down laws as a rule or\nteaches them as being eternal truths, whether man obeys God from free\nwill or from the necessity of the divine decree, whether the rewarding\nof the good and the punishing of the wicked is natural or\nsupernatural. The view one takes on these and similar questions has no\nbearing on faith, provided that such a belief does not lead to the\nassumption of greater license to sin, or hinders submission to God.\nIndeed \u2026 every person is in duty bound to adapt these religious\ndogmas to his own understanding and to interpret them for himself in\nwhatever way makes him feel that he can the more readily accept them\nwith full confidence and conviction. (TTP, chap. 14, G III.164/S\n162\u20133)\n\n\nFaith and piety belong not to the person who has the most rational\nargument for the existence of God or the most thorough philosophical\nunderstanding of his attributes, but to the person \u201cwho best\ndisplays works of justice and charity\u201d.\n3.2 The State\n\nSpinoza\u2019s account of religion has clear political ramifications.\nThere had always been a quasi-political agenda behind his decision to\nwrite the TTP, since his attack was directed at political meddling by\nreligious authorities. But he also took the opportunity to give a more\ndetailed and thorough presentation of a general theory of the state\nthat is only sketchily present in the Ethics. Such an\nexamination of the true nature of political society is particularly\nimportant to his argument for intellectual and religious freedom,\nsince he must show that such freedom is not only compatible with\npolitical well-being, but essential to it.\n\nThe individual egoism of the Ethics plays itself out in a\npre-political context\u2014the so-called \u201cstate of\nnature\u201d, a universal condition where there is no law or religion\nor justice and injustice\u2014as the right of every individual to do\nwhatever he can to preserve himself. \u201cWhatever every person,\nwhenever he is considered as solely under the dominion of Nature,\nbelieves to be to his advantage, whether under the guidance of sound\nreason or under passion\u2019s sway, he may by sovereign natural\nright seek and get for himself by any means, by force, deceit,\nentreaty, or in any other way he best can, and he may consequently\nregard as his enemy anyone who tries to hinder him from getting what\nhe wants\u201d (TTP, chap. 16, G III.190/S 174). Naturally, this is a\nrather insecure and dangerous condition under which to live. In\nHobbes\u2019 celebrated phrase\u2014and Spinoza was clearly\ninfluenced by his reading of that British thinker\u2014life in the\nstate of nature is \u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish and\nshort\u201d. As rational creatures, we soon realize that we would be\nbetter off, still from a thoroughly egoistic perspective, coming to an\nagreement among ourselves to restrain our opposing desires and the\nunbounded pursuit of self-interest\u2014in sum, that it would be in\nour greater self-interest to live under the law of reason rather than\nthe law of nature. We thus agree to hand over to a sovereign our\nnatural right and power to do whatever we can to satisfy our\ninterests. That sovereign\u2014whether it be an individual (in which\ncase the resulting state is a monarchy), a small group of individuals\n(an oligarchy) or the body-politic as a whole (a democracy)\u2014will\nbe absolute and unrestrained in the scope of its powers. It will be\ncharged with keeping all the members of society to the agreement,\nmostly by playing on their fear of the consequences of breaking the\n\u201csocial contract\u201d.\n\nObedience to the sovereign does not infringe upon our autonomy, since\nin following the commands of the sovereign we are following an\nauthority whom we have freely authorized and whose commands have no\nother object than our own rational self- interest. The type of\ngovernment most likely to respect and preserve that autonomy, issue\nlaws based on sound reason and to serve the ends for which government\nis instituted is democracy. It is the \u201cmost natural\u201d form\nof governing arising out of a social contract\u2014since in a\ndemocracy the people obey only laws that issue from the general will\nof the body politic\u2014and the least subject to various abuses of\npower. In a democracy, the rationality of the sovereign\u2019s\ncommands is practically secured, since it is unlikely that a majority\nof a large number of people will agree to an irrational design.\nMonarchy, on the other hand, is the least stable form of government\nand the one most likely to degenerate into tyranny.\n\nSince the outward practices of religion impinge upon the comportment\nand relations of citizens, they fall under \u201cstate\nbusiness\u201d and, thus, within the sphere of the sovereign\u2019s\npower. The sovereign should have complete dominion in all public\nmatters secular and spiritual. There should be no church separate from\nthe religion instituted and regulated by the state. This will prevent\nsectarianism and the multiplication of religious disputes. All\nquestions concerning external religious rites and ceremonies are in\nthe hands of the sovereign. This is in the best interest of everyone,\nsince the sovereign will, ideally and in conformity with its\n\u201ccontractual\u201d duty, insure that such practices are in\naccord with public peace and safety and social well-being. The\nsovereign should rule in such a way that his commands enforce\nGod\u2019s law. Justice and charity thereby acquire the force of\ncivil law, backed by the power of the sovereign. (For this reason, it\nis misleading to proclaim Spinoza as a proponent of the separation of\nchurch and state.)\n\nOn the other hand, dominion over the \u201cinward worship of\nGod\u201d and the beliefs accompanying it\u2014in other words, inner\npiety\u2014belongs exclusively to the individual. This is a matter of\ninalienable, private right, and it cannot be legislated, not even by\nthe sovereign. No one can limit or control another person\u2019s\nthoughts anyway, and it would be foolhardy and destructive to the\npolity for a sovereign to attempt to do so. Nor can speech ever truly\nand effectively be controlled, since people will always say want they\nwant, at least in private. \u201cEveryone is by absolute natural\nright the master of his own thoughts, and thus utter failure will\nattend any attempt in a commonwealth to force men to speak only as\nprescribed by the sovereign despite their different and opposing\nopinions\u201d (TTP, chap. 20, G III.240/S 223). There must, Spinoza\ngrants, be some limits to speech and teaching. Seditious\ndiscourse that encourages individuals to nullify the social contract\nshould not be tolerated. But the best government will err on the side\nof leniency and allow the freedom of philosophical speculation and the\nfreedom of religious belief. Certain \u201cinconveniences\u201d\nwill, no doubt, sometimes result from such an extensive liberty. But\nthe attempt to regulate everything by law is \u201cmore likely to\narouse vices than to reform them\u201d. In a passage that foreshadows\nJohn Stuart Mill\u2019s utilitarian defense of liberty nearly two\ncenturies later, Spinoza adds that \u201cthis freedom is of the first\nimportance in fostering the sciences and the arts, for only those\nwhose judgment is free and unbiased can attain success in these\nfields\u201d (TTP, chap. 20, G III.243/S 226).\n\nIt is hard to imagine a more passionate and reasoned defense of\nfreedom and toleration than that offered by Spinoza.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Spinoza\u2019s Works", "Recommended Secondary Literature in English"], "cat_ref_text": {"Spinoza\u2019s Works": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>Spinoza Opera</em>, edited by Carl Gebhardt, 5 volumes\n(Heidelberg: Carl Winters, 1925, 1972 [volume 5, 1987]).
