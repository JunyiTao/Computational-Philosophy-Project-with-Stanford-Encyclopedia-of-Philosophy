    "main_text": "\n\nThe philosophical impact of early German romanticism in general and\nGeorg Philipp Friedrich von Hardenberg (Novalis) in particular has\ntypically been traced back to a series of fragments and reflections on\npoetry, art, and beauty. Moreover, his name has been associated with\nan aestheticization of philosophy, an illegitimate valorizing of the\nmedieval, and a politically reactionary program. This view of von\nHardenberg, however, is to a large extent rooted in the image created\nposthumously by his increasingly conservative friends within the\nromantic circle. Furthermore, von Hardenberg\u2019s philosophical\nreputation has been shaped by his critics, the most prominent of whom\nwas Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.\n\nIn spite of his death at 28, von Hardenberg (1772\u20131801) left\nbehind a complex philosophical legacy that encompasses discussions of\nsubjectivity and self-consciousness, issues in epistemology, moral\ntheory, political philosophy, problems of interpretation, philosophy\nof history, philosophy of religion, the proto-existentialist\nexperience of the finality of human life, as well as a significant\ncontribution to aesthetics and philosophy of art. While von Hardenberg\nis best known for his literary production\u2014including the prose\npoem Hymns to the Night (1800) and the unfinished novels\nThe Apprentice from Said and Heinrich von\nOfterdingen (both published in 1802)\u2014this overview focuses\non the argumentative presuppositions for and systematic implications\nof von Hardenberg\u2019s philosophical work (without thereby\nsuggesting that his philosophy should be perceived as entirely\nseparate from his poetic production).\n",
