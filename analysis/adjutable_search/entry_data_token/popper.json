Life\n\nKarl Raimund Popper was born on 28 July 1902 in Vienna. His parents,\nwho were of Jewish origin, brought him up in an atmosphere which he\nwas later to describe as \u201cdecidedly bookish\u201d. His father\nwas a lawyer by profession, but he also took a keen interest in the\nclassics and in philosophy, and communicated to his son an interest in\nsocial and political issues. His mother inculcated in him such a\npassion for music that for a time he contemplated taking it up as a\ncareer; he initially chose the history of music as a second subject\nfor his Ph.D. examination. Subsequently, his love for music became one\nof the inspirational forces in the development of his thought, and\nmanifested itself in his highly original interpretation of the\nrelationship between dogmatic and critical thinking, in his account of\nthe distinction between objectivity and subjectivity, and, most\nimportantly, in the growth of his hostility towards all forms of\nhistoricism, including historicist ideas about the nature of the\n\u201cprogressive\u201d in music. The young Karl attended the local\nRealgymnasium, where he was unhappy with the standards of the\nteaching, and, after an illness he left to attend the University of\nVienna in 1918, matriculating four years later. In 1919 he became\nheavily involved in left-wing politics and became for a time a\nMarxist. However, he was quickly disillusioned with the doctrinaire\ncharacter of the latter, and soon abandoned it entirely. He also\ndiscovered the psychoanalytic theories of Freud and Adler (he served\nbriefly as a voluntary social worker with deprived children in one of\nthe latter\u2019s clinics in the 1920s), and heard Einstein lecture\non relativity theory. The dominance of the critical spirit in\nEinstein, and its total absence in Marx, Freud and Adler, struck\nPopper as being of fundamental importance: the pioneers of\npsychoanalysis, he came to think, couched their theories in terms\nwhich made them amenable only to confirmation, while Einstein\u2019s\ntheory, crucially, had testable implications which, if false, would\nhave falsified the theory itself.\n\nPopper took some time to settle on a career; he trained as a\ncabinetmaker, obtained a primary school teaching diploma in 1925 and\nqualified to teach mathematics and physics in secondary school in\n1929. He undertook a doctoral programme with the department of\npsychology at the University of Vienna, then under the supervision of\nKarl B\u00fchler, one of the founder members of the W\u00fcrzburg\nschool of experimental psychology. Popper\u2019s project was\ninitially designed as a psychological investigation of human memory,\non which he conducted initial research. However, the subject matter of\na planned introductory chapter on methodology assumed a position of\nincreasing pre-eminence and this resonated with B\u00fchler, who, as a\nKant scholar (a professor of philosophy and psychology), had famously\naddressed the issue of the contemporary \u201ccrisis in\npsychology\u201d. This \u201ccrisis\u201d, for B\u00fchler, related\nto the question of the unity of psychology and had been generated by\nthe proliferation of then competing paradigms within the discipline\nwhich had undermined the hitherto dominant associationist one and\nproblematized the question of method. Accordingly, under\nB\u00fchler\u2019s direction, Popper switched his topic to the\nmethodological problem of cognitive psychology and received his\ndoctorate in 1928 for his dissertation \u201cZur Methodenfrage der\nDenkpsychologie\u201d. In extending B\u00fchler\u2019s Kantian\napproach to the crisis in the dissertation, Popper critiqued Moritz\nSchlick\u2019s neutral monist programme to make psychology scientific\nby transforming it into a science of brain processes. This latter\nideal, Popper argued, was misconceived, but the issues raised by it\nultimately had the effect of refocusing Popper\u2019s attention away\nfrom B\u00fchler\u2019s question of the unity of psychology to that\nof its scientificity. This philosophical focus on questions of method,\nobjectivity and claims to scientific status was to become a principal\nlife-long concern, bringing the orientation of Popper\u2019s thought\ninto line with that of such contemporary \u201canalytic\u201d\nphilosophers as Frege and Russell as well as that of many members of\nthe Vienna Circle.\n\nPopper married Josephine Anna Henninger (\u201cHennie\u201d) in\n1930, and she also served as his amanuensis until her death in 1985.\nAt an early stage of their marriage they decided that they would never\nhave children. In 1937 he took up a position teaching philosophy at\nthe University of Canterbury in New Zealand, where he was to remain\nfor the duration of the Second World War.\n\nThe annexation of Austria in 1938 became the catalyst which prompted\nPopper to refocus his writings on social and political philosophy. He\npublished The Open Society and Its Enemies, his critique of\ntotalitarianism, in 1945. In 1946 he moved to England to teach at the\nLondon School of Economics, and became professor of logic and\nscientific method at the University of London in 1949. From this point\non his reputation and stature as a philosopher of science and social\nthinker grew, and he continued to write prolifically\u2014a number of\nhis works, particularly The Logic of Scientific Discovery\n(1959), are now widely seen as pioneering classics in the field.\nHowever, he combined a combative personality with a zeal for\nself-aggrandisement that did little to endear him to professional\ncolleagues. He was ill-at-ease in the philosophical milieu of post-war\nBritain which was, as he saw it, fixated with trivial linguistic\nconcerns dictated by Wittgenstein, whom he considered his nemesis.\nPopper\u2019s commitment to the primacy of rational criticism was\ncounterpointed by hostility towards anything that amounted to less\nthan total acceptance of his own thought, and in Britain\u2014as had\nbeen the case in Vienna\u2014he increasingly became an isolated\nfigure, though his ideas continued to inspire admiration.\n\nIn later years Popper came under philosophical criticism for his\nprescriptive approach to science and his emphasis on the logic of\nfalsification. This was superseded in the eyes of many by the\nsocio-historical approach taken by Thomas Kuhn in The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions (1962). In that work, Kuhn, who argued for\nthe incommensurability of rival scientific paradigms, denied that\nscience grows linearly through the accumulation of truths.\n\nPopper was knighted in 1965, and retired from the University of London\nin 1969, remaining active as a writer, broadcaster and lecturer until\nhis death in 1994. (For more detail on Popper\u2019s life, see his\nUnended Quest [1976]).\n2. Backdrop to Popper\u2019s Thought\n\nA number of biographical features may be identified as having a\nparticular influence upon Popper\u2019s thought. His teenage\nflirtation with Marxism left him thoroughly familiar with the Marxian\ndialectical view of economics, class-war, and history. But he was\nappalled by the failure of the democratic parties to stem the rising\ntide of fascism in Austria in the 1920s and 1930s, and the effective\nwelcome extended to it by the Marxists, who regarded fascism as a\nnecessary dialectical step towards the implosion of capitalism and the\nultimate victory of communism. The Poverty of Historicism\n(1944; 1957) and The Open Society and Its Enemies (1945),\nPopper\u2019s most impassioned and influential social works, are\npowerful defences of democratic liberalism, and strident critiques of\nphilosophical presuppositions underpinning all forms of\ntotalitarianism.\n\nPopper was also profoundly impressed by the differences between the\nallegedly \u201cscientific\u201d theories of Freud and Adler and the\nrevolution effected by Einstein\u2019s theory of Relativity in\nphysics in the first two decades of the twentieth century. The main\ndifference between them, as Popper saw it, was that while\nEinstein\u2019s theory was highly \u201crisky\u201d, in the sense\nthat it was possible to deduce consequences from it which were, in the\nlight of the then dominant Newtonian physics, highly improbable (e.g.,\nthat light is deflected towards solid bodies\u2014confirmed by\nEddington\u2019s experiments in 1919), and which would, if they\nturned out to be false, falsify the whole theory, nothing could, even\nin principle, falsify psychoanalytic theories. They were,\nPopper argues, \u201csimply non-testable, irrefutable. There was no\nconceivable human behaviour which could contradict them\u201d (1963:\n37). As such, they have more in common with myths than with genuine\nscience; \u201cThey contain most interesting psychological\nsuggestions, but not in a testable form\u201d (1963: 38). What is\napparently the chief source of strength of psychoanalysis, he\nconcluded, viz. its capability to accommodate and explain every\npossible form of human behaviour, is in fact a critical weakness, for\nit entails that it is not, and could not be, genuinely predictive. To\nthose who would respond that psychoanalytic theory is supported by\nclinical observations, Popper points out that\n\n\n\u2026 real support can be obtained only from observations\nundertaken as tests (by \u2018attempted refutations\u2019); and for\nthis purpose criteria of refutation have to be laid down\nbeforehand: it must be agree which observable situations, if actually\nobserved, mean that the theory is refuted. (1963: 38, footnote 3)\n\n\nPopper also considers that contemporary Marxism also lacks scientific\nstatus. Unlike psychoanalysis, he argues, Marxism had been initially\nscientific, in that it was genuinely predictive. However, when these\npredictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from\nfalsification by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses which made\nit compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserts, a theory\nwhich was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into\npseudo-scientific dogma. As he sees it, the Hegelian dialectic was\nadopted by Marxists not to oppose dogmatism but to accommodate it to\ntheir cause by eliminating the possibility of contradictory evidence.\nIt has thus become what Popper terms \u201creinforced\ndogmatism\u201d (1963: 334).\n\nThese factors combined to make Popper take falsifiability as\nhis criterion for demarcating science from non-science: if a theory is\nincompatible with possible empirical observations it is scientific;\nconversely, a theory which is compatible with all such observations,\neither because, as in the case of Marxism, it has been modified solely\nto accommodate such observations, or because, as in the case of\npsychoanalytic theories, it is consistent with all possible\nobservations, is unscientific. However, Popper is not a positivist and\nacknowledges that unscientific theories may be enlightening and that\neven purely mythogenic explanations have performed a valuable function\nin the past in expediting our understanding of the nature of\nreality.\n3. The Problem of Demarcation\n\nFor Popper the central problem in the philosophy of science is that of\ndemarcation, i.e., of distinguishing between science and what he terms\n\u201cnon-science\u201d (e.g., logic, metaphysics, psychoanalysis,\nand Adler\u2019s individual psychology). Popper is unusual amongst\ncontemporary philosophers in that he accepts the validity of\nthe Humean critique of induction, and indeed, goes beyond it in\narguing that induction is never actually used in science. However, he\ndoes not concede that this entails scepticism and argues that the\nBaconian/Newtonian insistence on the primacy of \u201cpure\u201d\nobservation, as the initial step in the formation of theories, is\ncompletely misguided: all observation is selective and theory-laden\nand there are no pure or theory-free observations. In this way he\ndestabilises the traditional view that science can be distinguished\nfrom non-science on the basis of its inductive methodology. In\ncontradistinction to this, Popper holds that there is no unique\nmethodology specific to science; rather, science, like virtually every\nother organic activity, consists largely of problem-solving.\n\nPopper accordingly rejects the view that induction is the\ncharacteristic method of scientific investigation and inference,\nsubstituting falsifiability in its place. It is easy, he\nargues, to obtain evidence in favour of virtually any theory, and he\nconsequently holds that such \u201ccorroboration\u201d, as he terms\nit, should count scientifically only if it is the positive result of a\ngenuinely \u201crisky\u201d prediction, which might conceivably have\nbeen false. In a critical sense, Popper\u2019s theory of demarcation\nis based upon his perception of the asymmetry which, at the level of\nlogic, holds between verification and falsification: it is logically\nimpossible to verify a universal proposition by reference to\nexperience (as Hume saw clearly), but a single genuine\ncounter-instance falsifies the corresponding universal law. In a word,\nan exception, far from \u201cproving\u201d a rule, conclusively\nrefutes it.\n\nEvery genuine scientific theory then, in Popper\u2019s view, is\nprohibitive, because the theories of natural science take the\nform of universal statements. \u201cAll As are\nX\u201d is equivalent to \u201cNo A is\nnot-X\u201d which is falsified if \u201cSome A is\nnot-X\u201d turns out to be true. For example, the law of\nthe conservation of energy can be expressed as \u201cThere is no\nperpetual motion machine\u201d.\n\nHowever, the universality of such laws, he argues, does rule out the\npossibility of their verification. Thus, a theory that has withstood\nrigorous testing should be deemed to have received a high measure of\ncorroboration. and may be retained provisionally as the best available\ntheory until it is finally falsified and/or is superseded by a better\ntheory.\n\nPopper stresses in particular that there is no unique way, no single\nmethod such as induction, which functions as the route to scientific\ntheory, and approvingly cites Einstein on that point:\n\n\nThere is no logical path leading to [the highly universal laws of\nscience]. They can only be reached by intuition, based upon something\nlike an intellectual love of the objects of experience. (2002:\n8\u20139)\n\n\nScience, in Popper\u2019s view, starts with problems rather than with\nobservations\u2014it is, indeed, precisely in the context of\ngrappling with a problem that the scientist makes observations in the\nfirst instance: his observations are selectively designed to test the\nextent to which a given theory functions as a satisfactory solution to\na given problem.\n\nOn this criterion of demarcation physics, chemistry, and\n(non-introspective) psychology, amongst others, are classified as\nsciences, psychoanalysis is a pre-science and astrology and phrenology\nare pseudo-sciences.\n4. Basic Statements, Falsifiability and Convention\n\nPopper draws a clear distinction between the logic of\nfalsifiability and its applied methodology. The logic of his\ntheory is utterly simple: a universal statement is falsified by a\nsingle genuine counter-instance. Methodologically, however, the\nsituation is complex: decisions about whether to accept an apparently\nfalsifying observation as an actual falsification can be problematic,\nas observational bias and measurement error, for example, can yield\nresults which are only apparently incompatible with the theory under\nscrutiny.\n\nThus, while advocating falsifiability as the criterion of demarcation\nfor science, Popper explicitly allows for the fact that in practice a\nsingle conflicting or counter-instance is never sufficient\nmethodologically for falsification, and that scientific theories are\noften retained even though much of the available evidence conflicts\nwith them, or is anomalous with respect to them.\n\nIn this connection, in the Logic of Scientific Discovery\nPopper introduces the technical concept of a \u201cbasic\nstatement\u201d or \u201cbasic proposition\u201d, which he defines\nas a statement which can serve as a premise in an empirical\nfalsification and which takes the singular existential form\n\u201cThere is an X at Y\u201d. Basic statements\nare important because they can formally contradict universal\nstatements, and accordingly play the role of potential falsifiers. To\ntake an example, the (putative) basic statement \u201cIn space-time\nregion k there is an apparatus which is a perpetual motion\nmachine\u201d contradicts the law of the conservation of energy, and\nwould, if true, falsify it (2002: 48). Accordingly, Popper holds that\nbasic statements are objective and are governed by two requirements:\n(a) the formal, that they must be both singular and\nexistential and (b) the material, that they must be\nintersubjectively testable.\n\nIn essence, basic statements are for Popper logical constructs which\nembrace and include \u2018observation statements\u2019, but for\nmethodological reasons he seeks to avoid that terminology, as it\nsuggests that they are derived directly from, and known by, experience\n(2002: 12, footnote 2), which would conflate them with the\n\u201cprotocol\u201d statements of logical positivism and\nreintroduce the empiricist idea that certain kinds of experiential\nreports are incorrigible. The \u201cobjectivity\u201d requirement in\nPopper\u2019s account of basic statements, by contrast, amounts to a\nrejection of the view that the truth of scientific statements can ever\nbe reduced to individual or collective human experience. (2002:\n25).\n\nPopper therefore argues that there are no statements in science which\ncannot be interrogated: basic statements, which are used to test the\nuniversal theories of science, must themselves be inter-subjectively\ntestable and are therefore open to the possibility of refutation. He\nacknowledges that this seems to present a practical difficulty, in\nthat it appears to suggest that testability must occur ad\ninfinitum, which he acknowledges is an operational absurdity:\nsooner or later all testing must come to an end. Where testing ends,\nhe argues, is in a convention-based decision to accept a basic\nstatement or statements; it is at that point that convention and\nintersubjective human agreement play an indispensable role in\nscience:\n\n\nEvery test of a theory, whether resulting in its corroboration or\nfalsification, must stop at some basic statement or other which we\ndecide to accept. If we do not come to any decision, and do\nnot accept some basic statement or other, then the test will have led\nnowhere. (2002: 86)\n\n\nHowever, Popper contends that while such a decision is usually\ncausally related to perceptual experience, it is not and\ncannot be justified by such experience; basic statements are\nexperientially underdetermined.\n\n\nExperiences can motivate a decision, and hence an acceptance\nor a rejection of a statement, but a basic statement cannot be\njustified by them\u2014no more than by thumping the table.\n(2002: 87\u201388)\n\n\nStatements can be justified only by other statements, and therefore\ntesting comes to an end, not in the establishment of a correlation\nbetween propositional content and observable reality, as empiricism\nwould hold, but by means of the conventional, inter-subjective\nacceptance of the truth of certain basic statements by the research\ncommunity.\n\nThe acceptance of basic statements is compared by Popper to trial by\njury: the verdict of the jury will be an agreement in accordance with\nthe prevailing legal code and on the basis of the evidence presented,\nand is analogous to the acceptance of a basic statement by the\nresearch community:\n\n\nBy its decision, the jury accepts, by agreement, a statement about a\nfactual occurrence\u2014a basic statement, as it were. (2002: 92)\n\n\nThe jury\u2019s verdict is conventional in arising out of a procedure\ngoverned by clear rules, and is an application of the legal system as\na whole as it applies to the case in question. The verdict is\naccordingly represented as a true statement of fact, but, as\nmiscarriages of justice demonstrate all too clearly,\n\n\nthe statement need not be true merely because the jury has accepted\nit. This \u2026 is acknowledged in the rule allowing a verdict to be\nquashed or revised. (2002: 92)\n\n\nThis is comparable, he argues, to the case of basic statements: their\nacceptance-as-true is also by agreement and, as such, it also\nconstitutes an application of a theoretical system, and\n\n\nit is only this application which makes any further applications of\nthe theoretical system possible. (2002: 93)\n\n\nHowever, the agreed acceptance of basic statements, like that of\njudicial verdicts, remain perennially susceptible to the requirement\nfor further interrogation. Popper terms this \u201cthe relativity of\nbasic statements\u201d (2002: 86), which is reflective of the\nprovisional nature of the entire corpus of scientific knowledge\nitself. Science does not, he maintains, rest upon any foundational\nbedrock. Rather, the theoretical systems of science are akin to\nbuildings in swampy ground constructed with the support of piles:\n\n\nThe piles are driven down from above into the swamp, but not down to\nany natural or \u201cgiven\u201d base; and if we stop driving the\npiles deeper, it is not because we have reached firm ground. We simply\nstop when we are satisfied that the piles are firm enough to carry the\nstructure, at least for the time being. (2002: 94)\n\n5. The Growth of Human Knowledge\n\nFor Popper, the growth of human knowledge proceeds from our problems\nand from our attempts to solve them. These attempts involve the\nformulation of theories which must go beyond existing knowledge and\ntherefore require a leap of the imagination. For this reason, he\nplaces special emphasis on the role played by the creative imagination\nin theory formulation. The priority of problems in\nPopper\u2019s account of science is paramount, and it is this which\nleads him to characterise scientists as \u201cproblem-solvers\u201d.\nFurther, since the scientist begins with problems rather than with\nobservations or \u201cbare facts\u201d, he argues that the only\nlogical technique which is an integral part of scientific method is\nthat of the deductive testing of theories which are not themselves the\nproduct of any logical operation. In this deductive procedure\nconclusions are inferred from a tentative hypothesis and are then\ncompared with one another and with other relevant statements to\ndetermine whether they falsify or corroborate the hypothesis. Such\nconclusions are not directly compared with the facts, Popper stresses,\nsimply because there are no \u201cpure\u201d facts available; all\nobservation-statements are theory-laden, and are as much a function of\npurely subjective factors (interests, expectations, wishes, etc.) as\nthey are a function of what is objectively real.\n\nHow then does the deductive procedure work? Popper specifies four\nsteps (2002: 9):\n\nThe first is formal, a testing of the internal\nconsistency of the theoretical system to see if it involves any\ncontradictions.\nThe second step is semi-formal, \u201cthe investigation\nof the logical form of the theory, with the object of determining\nwhether it has the character of an empirical or scientific theory, or\nwhether it is, for example, tautological\u201d (2002: 9).\nThe third step is the comparing of the new theory with existing\nones to determine whether it constitutes an advance upon them. If its\nexplanatory success matches that of the existing theories, and it\nadditionally explains some hitherto anomalous phenomenon or solves\nsome hitherto unsolvable problems, it will be adopted as constituting\nan advance upon the existing theories. In that sense, science involves\ntheoretical progress: on this account, a theory X is better\nthan a \u201crival\u201d theory Y if X has\ngreater empirical content, and hence greater predictive\npower, than Y.\nThe fourth and final step is the testing of a theory by the\nempirical application of the conclusions derived from it. If such\nconclusions are shown to be true, the theory is corroborated (but\nnever verified). If the conclusion is shown to be false, then this is\ntaken as a signal that the theory cannot be completely correct\n(logically the theory is falsified), and the scientist begins his\nquest for a better theory. He does not, however, abandon the\npresent theory until such time as he has a better one to substitute\nfor it.\n\n\nThe general picture of Popper\u2019s philosophy of science, then is\nthis: Hume\u2019s philosophy demonstrates that there is a\ncontradiction implicit in traditional empiricism, which holds that\nuniversal scientific laws are in some way finally confirmable by\nexperience, despite the open-ended nature of the latter being\nacknowledged. Popper eliminates the contradiction by removing the\ndemand for empirical verification in favour of empirical falsification\nor corroboration. Scientific theories, for him, are not inductively\ninferred from experience, nor is scientific experimentation carried\nout with a view to verifying or finally establishing the truth of\ntheories; rather, all knowledge is provisional, conjectural,\nhypothetical\u2014the universal theories of science can never be\nconclusively established. Hence Popper\u2019s emphasis on the\nimportance of the critical spirit to science\u2014for him critical\nthinking is the very essence of rationality. For it is only by\ncritical thought that we can eliminate false theories and determine\nwhich of the remaining theories is the best available one, in the\nsense of possessing the highest level of explanatory force and\npredictive power.\n6. Probability, Knowledge and Verisimilitude\n\nIn the view of many social scientists, the more probable a theory is,\nthe better it is, and if we have to choose between two\ntheories which differ only in that one is probable and the other is\nimprobable, then we should choose the former. Popper rejects this.\nScience values theories with a high informative content, because they\npossess a high predictive power and are consequently highly testable.\nFor that reason, the more improbable a theory is the better\nit is scientifically, because the probability and informative content\nof a theory vary inversely\u2014the higher the informative content of\na theory the lower will be its probability. Thus, the statements which\nare of special interest to science are those with a high informative\ncontent and (consequentially) a low probability, which\nnevertheless come close to the truth. Informative content,\nwhich is in inverse proportion to probability, is in direct proportion\nto testability. As a result, the severity of the test to which a\ntheory can be subjected, and by means of which it is falsified or\ncorroborated, is of fundamental importance.\n\nPopper also argues that all scientific criticism must be piecemeal,\ni.e., he holds that it is not possible to question every aspect of a\ntheory at once, as certain items of what he terms \u201cbackground\nknowledge\u201d must be taken for granted. But that is not\nknowledge in the sense of being conclusively established; it may be\nchallenged at any time, especially if it is suspected that its\nuncritical acceptance may be responsible for difficulties which are\nsubsequently encountered.\n\nHow then can one be certain that one is questioning the right thing?\nThe Popperian answer is that we cannot have absolute certainty here,\nbut repeated tests usually show where the trouble lies. As we saw, for\nPopper even observation statements are corrigible and open to review,\nand science in his view is not a quest for certain knowledge, but an\nevolutionary process in which hypotheses or conjectures are\nimaginatively proposed and tested in order to explain facts or to\nsolve problems. For that reason, he emphasises both the importance of\nquestioning the background knowledge when the need arises, and the\nsignificance of the fact that observation-statements are theory-laden\nand corrigible.\n\nPopper was initially uneasy with the concept of truth, and in his\nearliest writings he avoided asserting that a theory which is\ncorroborated is true\u2014for clearly if every theory is an\nopen-ended hypothesis, then ipso facto it has to be at least\npotentially false. However, he came to accept Tarski\u2019s\nreformulation of the correspondence theory of truth, and in\nConjectures and Refutations (1963) he integrates the concepts\nof truth and content to frame the metalogical concept of\n\u201ctruthlikeness\u201d or \u201cverisimilitude\u201d.\nA \u201cgood\u201d scientific theory, Popper argues in that work,\nhas a higher level of verisimilitude than its rivals, and he\nexplicates this concept by reference to the logical consequences of\ntheories. A theory\u2019s content is the totality of its logical\nconsequences, which can be divided into two classes:\n\nthe \u201ctruth-content\u201d, which is the class of\ntrue propositions which may be derived from it, and\nthe \u201cfalsity-content\u201d of a theory, which is\nthe class of the theory\u2019s false consequences (which may be\nempty, and in the case of a theory which is true is necessarily\nempty).\n\n\nPopper offers two accounts of how rival theories can be compared in\nterms of their levels of verisimilitude; these are the qualitative and\nquantitative definitions. On the qualitative account, verisimilitude\nis defined in terms of subclass relationships: a theory \\(t_2\\) has a\nhigher level of verisimilitude than \\(t_1\\) if and only if their\ntruth- and falsity-contents are comparable through subclass\nrelationships, and either\n\n\\(t_2\\)\u2019s truth-content includes \\(t_1\\)\u2019s and\n\\(t_2\\)\u2019s falsity-content, if it exists, is included in, or is\nthe same as, \\(t_1\\)\u2019s, or\n\\(t_2\\)\u2019s truth-content includes or is the same as\n\\(t_1\\)\u2019s and \\(t_2\\)\u2019s falsity-content, if it exists, is\nincluded in \\(t_1\\)\u2019s.\n\n\nOn the quantitative account, verisimilitude is defined by assigning\nquantities to contents, where the index of the content of a given\ntheory is its logical improbability, given again that content and\nprobability vary inversely (1963: 233\u20134). The utilisation of\neither method of computing verisimilitude shows, Popper argues, that\neven if a theory \\(t_2\\) with a higher content than a rival theory\n\\(t_1\\) is subsequently falsified, it can still legitimately be\nregarded as a better theory than \\(t_1\\), and \u201cbetter\u201d is\nhere now understood to mean \\(t_2\\) is closer to the truth\nthan \\(t_1\\) (1963: 235).\n\nThus, scientific progress involves, on this view, the abandonment of\npartially true, but falsified, theories, for theories with a higher\nlevel of verisimilitude, i.e., which approach more closely to the\ntruth. In this way, verisimilitude allowed Popper to mitigate what\nsome saw as the pessimism of an anti-inductivist philosophy of\nscience. With the introduction of the concept, Popper was able to\nrepresent his account as an essentially realistic position in terms of\nwhich scientific progress can be seen as progress towards the\ntruth, and experimental corroboration can be viewed as an\nindicator of verisimilitude.\n\nHowever, subsequent research revealed defects in Popper\u2019s formal\ndefinitions of verisimilitude. The concept is most important in his\nsystem because of its application to theories which are approximations\n(which are common in the social sciences) and thus known to be\nfalse. In this connection, Popper had written:\n\n\nUltimately, the idea of verisimilitude is most important in cases\nwhere we know that we have to work with theories which are at\nbest approximations\u2014that is to say, theories of which we\nknow that they cannot be true\u2026 In these cases we can still\nspeak of better or worse approximations to the truth (and we therefore\ndo not need to interpret these cases in an instrumentalist sense).\n(1963: 235)\n\n\nIn 1974, David Miller and Pavel Tich\u00fd, working independently,\ndemonstrated that the conditions specified by Popper in his accounts\nof both qualitative and quantitative verisimilitude for comparing the\ntruth- and falsity-contents of theories can be satisfied only when the\ntheories are true. In the crucially important case of false\ntheories, Popper\u2019s definitions are formally defective: for with\nregard to a false theory \\(t_2\\) which has excess content over a rival\ntheory \\(t_1\\), both the truth-content and the\nfalsity-content of \\(t_2\\) will exceed that of \\(t_1\\). With respect\nto theories which are false then, Popper\u2019s conditions for\ncomparing levels of verisimilitude, whether in quantitative and\nqualitative terms, can never be met.\n\nPopper\u2019s response was two-fold. In the first place, he\nacknowledges the deficiencies in his own formal account:\n\n\n\u201c\u2026my main mistake was the failure to see at once that my\n\u2019A Theorem on Truth-Content\u2019 [1966], could be extended to\nfalsity content: if the content of a false statement a\nexceeds that of a statement b, then the truth content of\na exceeds the truth content of b, and the same holds\nof their falsity contents.\u201d (1979, 371)\n\n\nBut he argues that\n\n\n\u201cI do think that we should not conclude from the failure of my\nattempts to solve the problem that the problem cannot be solved.\nPerhaps it cannot be solved by purely logical means but only by a\nrelativization to relevant problems or even by bringing in the\nhistorical problem situation\u201d (1979, 372).\n\n\nThis suggestion was to precipitate a great deal of important technical\nresearch in the field. He additionally moves the task of formally\ndefining the concept from centre-stage in his philosophy of science by\nprotesting that he had never intended to imply\n\n\nthat degrees of verisimilitude \u2026 can ever be numerically\ndetermined, except in certain limiting cases. (1979: 59)\n\n\nInstead, he argues, the chief value of the concept is heuristic, in\nwhich the absence of an adequate formal definition is not an\ninsuperable impediment to its utilisation in the actual appraisal of\ntheories relativised to problems in which we have an interest.\n\nMany see the thrust of this latter strategy as genuinely reflecting\nthe significance of the concept of verisimilitude in Popper\u2019s\nsystem, but it has not satisfied all of his critics.\n7. Objective Knowledge and The Three Worlds Ontology\n\nPopper\u2019s hostility to psychologistic approaches to epistemology\nis evident from his earliest works. Questions relating to the origins\nof convictions, feelings of certainty and the like, he argues, are\nproperly considered the province of psychology; their attempted use in\nepistemology, which has been characteristic in particular of some\nschools of empiricism, can lead only to confusion and ultimately to\nscepticism. Against it, he repeatedly insists on the objectivity of\nscientific knowledge and sees it as the principal task of epistemology\nto engage with the questions of justification and validity in that\nconnection (2002: 7).\n\nIn some of his later works in the field, particularly his\n\u201cEpistemology Without a Knowing Subject\u201d (1967,\nrepublished in Objective Knowledge [1972]) and in his lecture\n\u201cThree Worlds\u201d in the Tanner Lectures on Human Values\ndelivered in 1978 (published 1980), Popper develops the notion of\nobjectivity further in a novel but controversial way by seeking to\nfree it completely from all psychological constraints. What is central\nto epistemology, he reaffirms, is the concept of objectivity, which he\nseeks to show requires neither the notions of subjective mental states\nnor even that of a subject \u201cpossessing\u201d knowledge:\nknowledge in its full objective sense, he argues, is knowledge\n\u201cwithout a knowing subject\u201d.\n\nPopper\u2019s angle of approach here is to situate the development of\nknowledge in the context of animal and human evolution. It is\ncharacteristic of evolutionary processes, he points out, that they\ncome to take place in an environment which is itself in part fashioned\nby the species in question. Examples of this abound, such as the reefs\nbuilt by corals, the hives built by bees, the dams built by beavers\nand the atmospheric effects yielded by plants. This, Popper contends,\nis also true of human beings: we too have created new kinds of\nproducts, \u201cintellectual products\u201d, which shape our\nenvironment. These are our myths, our ideas, our art works and our\nscientific theories about the world in which we live. When placed in\nan evolutionary context, he suggests, such products must be viewed\ninstrumentally, as exosomatic artefacts. Chief amongst them is\nknowledge\n\n\nin the objective or impersonal sense, in which it may be said to be\ncontained in a book; or stored in a library; or taught in a\nuniversity. (1979: 286)\n\n\nOn this view, termed \u201cevolutionary epistemology\u201d, the\ngrowth of human knowledge is an objective evolutionary process which\ninvolves the creation and promulgation of new problem-solving\ntheories, which are then subjected to the challenge of criticism,\nmodification, elimination and replacement. These latter activities are\nseen by Popper as growth-promoting in the evolution of knowledge,\nwhich he represents by means of a tetradic schema (1979: 287):\n\n\\[ P_1 \\rightarrow \\textit{TT} \\rightarrow \\textit{EE} \\rightarrow P_2. \\]\n\n\nHere \u201c\\(P_1\\)\u201d stands for the \u201cinitial\nproblem\u201d; \u201cTT\u201d stands for \u201ctentative\ntheory\u201d designed to solve it, \u201cEE\u201d stands\nfor \u201cattempts at error-elimination\u201d, and\n\u201c\\(P_2\\)\u201d represents further problems that arise out of\nthe critical process.\n\nThis kind of knowledge development, Popper argues, cannot be explained\neither by physicalism, which seeks to reduce all mental processes and\nstates to material ones, or by dualism, which usually seeks to\nexplicate knowledge by means of psychological categories such as\nthought, perception and belief. Consequently, he proposes a novel form\nof pluralistic realism, a \u201cThree Worlds\u201d ontology, which,\nwhile accommodating both the world of physical states and processes\n(world 1) and the mental world of psychological processes (world 2),\nrepresents knowledge in its objective sense as belonging to world 3, a\nthird, objectively real ontological category. That world is the\nworld\n\n\nof the products of the human mind, such as languages; tales and\nstories and religious myths; scientific conjectures or theories, and\nmathematical constructions; songs and symphonies; paintings and\nsculptures. (1980: 144)\n\n\nIn short, world 3 is the world of human cultural artifacts, which are\nproducts of world 2 mental processes, usually instantiated in the\nphysical world 1 environment.\n\nPopper proceeds to explicate his distinction between the subjective\nand objective senses of knowledge by reference to this ontology. The\nsubjective sense of knowledge relates to psychological processes and\nstates, mental dispositions, beliefs and expectations, which may\ngenerically be termed \u201cthought processes\u201d and which belong\nto world 2. Knowledge in the objective sense, by contrast, consists\nnot of thought processes but of thought contents, that is to\nsay, the content of propositionalised theories: it is\n\n\nthe content which can be, at least approximately, translated from one\nlanguage into another. The objective thought content is that which\nremains invariant in a reasonably good translation. (1980: 156)\n\n\nAnd it is that thought content, when linguistically codified in texts,\nworks of art, log tables, mathematical formulae, which constitutes\nworld 3, to which objective knowledge relates.\n\nFor those who would suggest that such objects are mere abstractions\nfrom world 2 thought processes, Popper counters that world 3 objects\nare necessarily more than the thought processes which have led to\ntheir creation. Theories, for example, usually have logical\nimplications beyond anything considered by their original author, as\ninstanced in the case of Einstein\u2019s Special Theory of\nRelativity. Moreover, what is most characteristic about such objects\nis that, unlike world 2 mental processes, they can stand in logical\nrelationships to each other, such as equivalence, deducibility and\ncompatibility, which makes them amenable to the kind of critical\nrational analysis and development that is one of the hallmarks of\nscience. As he puts it,\n\n\nCriticism of world 3 objects is of the greatest importance, both in\nart and especially in science. Science can be said to be largely the\nresult of the critical examination and selection of conjectures, of\nthought contents. (1980: 160)\n\n\nPopper takes Michelangelo\u2019s sculpture The Dying Slave\nas an illustrative example of a world 3 object, embodied in a world 1\nblock of marble. Other examples given include memory engrams in the\nbrain, the American Constitution, Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies,\nBeethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony and Newton\u2019s theory of\ngravitation. Each one of these, he contends, is a world 3 object that\ntranscends both its physical, world 1 embodiments and its world 2\ncognitive origins (1980: 145).\n\nPopper was aware that he would be accused of hypostatising\nabstractions in asserting the reality and objectivity of world 3\nobjects. In response, he indicates strongly that he has no interest in\nwhat he regards as pointless terminological disputes over the meaning\nof the term \u201cworld\u201d or \u201creal\u201d. He is therefore\ncontent, if required, to express his account of objective knowledge in\nmore familiar and perhaps more mundane terms: world 3 objects are\nabstract objects while their physical embodiments are\nconcrete objects. But that should not be allowed to disguise\nthe fact that he saw the relationships between the three categories of\nhis ontology as of enormous importance in understanding the role of\nscience as an element of culture:\n\n\nmy thesis is that our world 3 theories and our world 3 plans causally\ninfluence the physical objects of world 1; that they have a causal\naction upon world 1. (1980: 164)\n\n\nIn the final analysis it is the causal interaction between the worlds\nthat ultimately matters in Popper\u2019s objectivist epistemology: it\nallows him to represent the growth of human knowledge as an\nevolutionary process of exosomatic adaptations, which is ultimately a\nfunction of the interplay of relations between the physical and mental\nworlds and the world of objective knowledge or thought content.\n8. Social and Political Thought\u2014The Critique of Historicism and Holism\n\nGiven Popper\u2019s personal history and background, it is hardly\nsurprising that he developed a deep and abiding interest in social and\npolitical philosophy. He understood holism as the view that human\nsocial groupings are greater than the sum of their members, that they\nact on their human members and shape their destinies and that they are\nsubject to their own independent laws of development. Historicism he\nidentified as the belief that history develops inexorably and\nnecessarily according to certain principles or rules towards a\ndeterminate end (as for example in the Marx\u2019s dialectical\nmaterialism). The link between them is that holism holds that\nindividuals are essentially formed by the social groupings to which\nthey belong, while historicism suggests that we can understand such a\nsocial grouping only in terms of the internal principles which\ndetermine its development.\n\nThese lead to what Popper calls \u201cThe Historicist Doctrine of the\nSocial Sciences\u201d, the views (a) that the principal task of the\nsocial sciences is to make predictions about the social and political\ndevelopment of man, and (b) that the task of politics, once the key\npredictions have been made, is, in Marx\u2019s words, to lessen the\n\u201cbirth pangs\u201d of future social and political developments.\nPopper thinks that this view of the social sciences is both\ntheoretically misconceived and socially dangerous, as it can give rise\nto totalitarianism and authoritarianism\u2014to centralised\ngovernmental control of the individual and the attempted imposition of\nlarge-scale social planning. Against this, he advances the view that\nany human social grouping is no more (or less) than the sum of its\nindividual members, that what happens in history is the (largely\nunforeseeable) result of the actions of such individuals, and that\nlarge scale social planning to an antecedently conceived blueprint is\ninherently misconceived\u2014and inevitably\ndisastrous\u2014precisely because human actions have consequences\nwhich cannot be foreseen. Popper, then, is an historical\nindeterminist, insofar as he holds that history does not\nevolve in accordance with intrinsic laws or principles, that in the\nabsence of such laws and principles unconditional prediction in the\nsocial sciences is an impossibility, and that there is no such thing\nas historical necessity.\n\nThe link between Popper\u2019s theory of knowledge and his social\nphilosophy is his fallibilism. We make theoretical progress in science\nby subjecting our theories to critical scrutiny, and abandoning those\nwhich have been falsified. So too in an open society the rights of the\nindividual to criticise administrative policies will be safeguarded\nand upheld, undesirable policies will be eliminated in a manner\nanalogous to the elimination of falsified scientific theories, and\npolitical differences will be resolved by critical discussion and\nargument rather than by coercion. The open society as thus conceived\nof by Popper may be defined as\n\n\nan association of free individuals respecting each other\u2019s\nrights within the framework of mutual protection supplied by the\nstate, and achieving, through the making of responsible, rational\ndecisions, a growing measure of humane and enlightened life. (R. B.\nLevinson 1953: 17)\n\n\nSuch as society is not a utopian ideal, Popper argues, but an\nempirically realised form of social organisation which is in every\nrespect superior to its (real or potential) totalitarian rivals. His\nstrategy, however, is not merely to engage in a moral defence of the\nideology of liberalism, but rather to show that totalitarianism is\ntypically based upon historicist and holist presuppositions, and of\ndemonstrating that these presuppositions are fundamentally\nincoherent.\n9. Scientific Knowledge, History, and Prediction\n\nHistoricism and holism, Popper argues, have their origins in what he\nterms\n\n\none of the oldest dreams of mankind\u2014the dream of prophecy, the\nidea that we can know what the future has in store for us, and that we\ncan profit from such knowledge by adjusting our policy to it. (1963:\n338)\n\n\nThis dream was given impetus, he suggests, by the emergence of a\ngenuine predictive capability regarding solar and lunar eclipses at an\nearly stage in human civilisation, which became refined with the\ndevelopment of the natural sciences. Historicism derives a superficial\nplausibility from the suggestion that, just as the application of the\nlaws of the natural sciences can lead to the prediction of such events\nas eclipses, knowledge of \u201cthe laws of history\u201d as yielded\nby a social science or sciences can and should lead to the prediction\nof future social phenomena. Why should we not conceive of a social\nscience which would function as the theoretical natural sciences\nfunction and yield precise unconditional predictions in the\nappropriate sphere of application? Popper seeks to show that this idea\nis based upon a series of misconceptions about the nature of science,\nand about the relationship between scientific laws and scientific\nprediction.\n\nIn relation to the critically important concept of prediction, Popper\nmakes a distinction between what he terms \u201cconditional\nscientific predictions\u201d, which have the form \u201cIf\nX takes place, then Y will take place\u201d, and\n\u201cunconditional scientific prophecies\u201d, which have the form\n\u201cY will take place\u201d. Contrary to popular belief,\nit is the former rather than the latter which are typical of the\nnatural sciences, which means that typically prediction in natural\nscience is conditional and limited in scope\u2014it takes the form of\nhypothetical assertions stating that certain specified changes will\ncome about if and only if particular specified events antecedently\ntake place. This is not to deny that \u201cunconditional scientific\nprophecies\u201d, such as the prediction of eclipses, for example, do\ntake place in science, and that the theoretical natural sciences make\nthem possible. However, Popper argues that (a) these unconditional\nprophecies are not characteristic of the natural sciences,\nand (b) that the mechanism whereby they occur, in the very limited way\nin which they do, is not understood by the historicist.\n\nWhat is the mechanism which makes \u201cunconditional scientific\nprophecies\u201d possible? Popper\u2019s answer is that they are\npossible because they are derived from a combination of conditional\npredictions (themselves derived from scientific laws) and\nexistential statements specifying that the conditions in relation to\nthe system being investigated are fulfilled.\n\nGiven that this is the mechanism which generates unconditional\nscientific prophecies, Popper makes two related claims about\nhistoricism:\n\n\nThe first is that the historicist does not, as a matter of fact,\nderive his historical prophecies from conditional scientific\npredictions. The second \u2026 is that he cannot possibly do so\nbecause long term prophecies can be derived from scientific\nconditional predictions only if they apply to systems which can be\ndescribed as well isolated, stationary, and recurrent. These systems\nare very rare in nature; and modern society is surely not one of them.\n(1963: 339)\n\n\nPopper accordingly argues that it is a fundamental mistake for the\nhistoricist to take the unconditional scientific prophecies of\neclipses as being typical and characteristic of the predictions of\nnatural science; they are possible only because our solar system is a\nstationary and repetitive system which is isolated from other such\nsystems by immense expanses of empty space. Human society and human\nhistory are not isolated systems and are continually\nundergoing rapid, non-repetitive development. In the most fundamental\nsense possible, every event in human history is discrete, novel, quite\nunique, and ontologically distinct from every other historical event.\nFor this reason, it is impossible in principle that unconditional\nscientific prophecies could be made in relation to human\nhistory\u2014the idea that the successful unconditional prediction of\neclipses provides us with reasonable grounds for the hope of\nsuccessful unconditional prediction regarding the evolution of human\nhistory turns out to be based upon a gross misconception. As Popper\nsuccinctly concludes, \u201cThe fact that we predict eclipses does\nnot, therefore, provide a valid reason for expecting that we can\npredict revolutions\u201d (1963: 340).\n10. Immutable Laws and Contingent Trends\n\nAn additional mistake which Popper discerns in historicism is the\nfailure of the historicist to distinguish between scientific\nlaws and trends. This makes him think it possible to\nexplain change by discovering trends running through past history, and\nto anticipate and predict future occurrences on the basis of such\nobservations. Here Popper points out that there is a critical\ndifference between a trend and a scientific law: the latter is\nuniversal in form, while a trend can be expressed only as a singular\nexistential statement. This logical difference is crucial: neither\nconditional nor unconditional predictions can be based upon trends,\nbecause trends may change or be reversed with a change in the\nconditions which gave rise to them in the first instance. As Popper\nputs it, there can be no doubt that\n\n\nthe habit of confusing trends with laws, together with the intuitive\nobservation of trends such as technical progress, inspired the central\ndoctrines of \u2026 historicism. (1957: 106)\n\n\nHe does not, of course, dispute the existence of trends or deny that\nobserving them can be of practical utility value. But the essential\npoint is that a trend is something which itself ultimately\nstands in need of scientific explanation, and it cannot therefore\nfunction as the frame of reference in terms of which an unconditional\nprediction can be based.\n\nA point which connects with this has to do with the role which the\nevolution of human knowledge has played in the historical development\nof human society. Human history has, Popper points out, been strongly\ninfluenced by the growth of human knowledge, and it is\nextremely likely that this will continue to be the case\u2014all the\nempirical evidence suggests that the link between the two is\nprogressively consolidating. However, this gives rise to a further\nproblem for the historicist: no scientific predictor, human or\notherwise, can possibly predict its own future results. From this it\nfollows, he holds, that no society can predict, scientifically, its\nown future states of knowledge. Thus, while the future evolution of\nhuman history is extremely likely to be influenced by new developments\nin human knowledge, we cannot now scientifically determine what such\nknowledge will be.\n\nFrom this it follows that if the future holds any new discoveries or\nany new developments in the growth of our knowledge, then it is\nimpossible for us to predict them now, and it is therefore impossible\nfor us to predict the future development of human history now, given\nthat the latter will, at least in part, be determined by the future\ngrowth of our knowledge. Thus, once again historicism\ncollapses\u2014the dream of a theoretical, predictive science of\nhistory is unrealisable, because it is an impossible dream.\n\nPopper\u2019s argues against the propriety of large-scale planning of\nsocial structures on the basis of this demonstration of the logical\nshortcomings of historicism. It is, he argues, theoretically as well\nas practically misguided, because, again, part of what we are planning\nfor is our future knowledge, and our future knowledge is not something\nwhich we can in principle now possess\u2014we cannot adequately plan\nfor unexpected advances in our future knowledge, or for the effects\nwhich such advances will have upon society as a whole. For him, this\nnecessitates the acceptance of historical indeterminism as the only\nphilosophy of history which is commensurate with a proper\nunderstanding of the provisional and incomplete nature of human\nknowledge.\n\nThis critique of historicism and holism is balanced, on the positive\nside, by Popper\u2019s affirmation of the ideals of individualism and\nmarket economics and his strong defence of the open society\u2014the\nview that a society is equivalent to the sum of its members, that the\nactions of the members of society serve to fashion and to shape it,\nand that the social consequences of intentional actions are very\noften, and very largely, unintentional. This part of his social\nphilosophy was influenced by the economist Friedrich Hayek, who worked\nwith him at the London School of Economics and who was a life-long\nfriend. Popper advocates what he (rather unfortunately) terms\n\u201cpiecemeal social engineering\u201d as the central mechanism\nfor social planning: in utilising this mechanism, intentional actions\nare directed to the achievement of one specific goal at a time, which\nmakes it possible to determine whether adverse unintended effects of\nintentional actions occur, in order to correct and readjust when this\nproves necessary. This, of course, parallels precisely the critical\ntesting of theories in scientific investigation. This approach to\nsocial planning (which is explicitly based upon the premise that we do\nnot, because we cannot, know what the future will be like) encourages\nattempts to put right what is problematic in\nsociety\u2014generally-acknowledged social ills\u2014rather than\nattempts to impose some preconceived idea of the \u201cgood\u201d\nupon society as a whole. For Popper, in a genuinely open society\npiecemeal social engineering goes hand-in-hand with negative\nutilitarianism, the attempt to minimise the amount of suffering and\nmisery, rather than, as with positive utilitarianism, the attempt to\nmaximise the amount of happiness. The state, he holds, should concern\nitself with the task of progressively formulating and implementing\npolicies designed to deal with the social problems which actually\nconfront it, with the goal of mitigating human misery and suffering to\nthe greatest possible degree. The positive task of increasing social\nand personal happiness, by contrast, can and should be left to\nindividual citizens, who may, of course, act collectively to that end.\n\u201cMy thesis\u201d, Popper states, is that\n\n\nhuman misery is the most urgent problem of a rational public policy\nand that happiness is not such a problem. The attainment of happiness\nshould be left to our private endeavours. (1963: 361)\n\n\nThus, for Popper, in the final analysis the activity of\nproblem-solving is as definitive of our humanity at the level of\nsocial and political organisation as it is at the level of science,\nand it is this key insight which unifies and integrates the broad\nspectrum of his thought.\n11. Critical Evaluation\n\nWhile it cannot be said that Popper was modest, he took criticism of\nhis theories very seriously, and spent much of his time in his later\nyears in addressing them. The following is a summary of some of the\nmain ones which he had to address. (For Popper\u2019s responses to\ncritical commentary, see his \u201cReplies to My Critics\u201d\n(1974) and his Realism and the Aim of Science (1983).\n\nFirst, Popper claims to be a realist and rejects conventionalist and\ninstrumentalist accounts of science. But his account in the Logic\nof Scientific Discovery of the role played by basic statements in\nthe methodology of falsification seems to sit uneasily with that. As\nwe have seen, he follows Kant in rejecting the positivist/empiricist\nview that observation statements are incorrigible, and argues that\nthey are descriptions of what is observed as interpreted by the\nobserver with reference to a determinate conceptual and theoretical\nframework. He accordingly asserts that while basic statements may have\na causal relationship to experience, they are neither determined nor\njustified by it.\n\nHowever, this would seem to pose a difficulty: if a theory is to be\ngenuinely testable, it must be possible to determine, at least in\nprinciple, whether the basic statements which are its potential\nfalsifiers are actually true or false. But how can this be known, if\nbasic statements cannot be justified by experience? As we have seen,\nPopper\u2019s answer is that the acceptance or rejection of basic\nstatements depends upon a convention-based decision on the part of the\nscientific community.\n\n\nFrom a logical point of view, the testing of a theory depends upon\nbasic statements whose acceptance or rejection, in its turn, depends\nupon our decisions. Thus it is decisions which settle the fate of\ntheories. (2002: 91)\n\n\nTraditional conventionalism, as exemplified in the work of Mach,\nPoincar\u00e9 and Milhaud amongst others, holds that a\n\u201csuccessful\u201d science is one in which universal theories\nhave assumed such explanatory critical mass that a convention emerges\nto pre-empt the possibility of their empirical refutation. This is\nstrongly rejected by Popper, who differentiates his position from it\nby arguing that it is the acceptance of basic statements, rather than\nthat universal theory, which is determined by convention and\nintersubjective agreement. For him, the acceptance or rejection of\ntheory occurs only indirectly and at a higher investigative level,\nthrough critical tests made possible by the conventional acceptance of\nbasic statements. As he puts it, \u201cI differ from the\nconventionalist in holding that the statements decided by agreement\nare not universal but singular\u201d (2002: 92). Simultaneously,\nhowever, he rejects any suggestion that basic statements are\njustifiable by direct experience:\n\n\nI differ from the positivist in holding that basic statements are not\njustifiable by our immediate experiences, but are, from the logical\npoint of view, accepted by an act, by a free decision. (2002: 92)\n\n\nIt is thus evident that Popper saw his account of basic statements as\nsteering a course between the Scylla of orthodox conventionalism and\nthe Charybdis of positivism/empiricism. However, while it is both\ncoherent and consistent in that regard, there can be little doubt but\nthat it constitutes a form of conventionalism in its own right. And it\nis not clear that it is compatible with scientific realism, understood\nas the view that scientific theories give true or approximately true\ndescriptions of elements of a mind-independent world. As Lakatos puts\nit,\n\n\nIf a theory is falsified, it is proven false; if it is\n\u201cfalsified\u201d [in Popper\u2019s conventionalist sense], it\nmay still be true. If we follow up this sort of\n\u201cfalsification\u201d by the actual \u201celimination\u201d of\na theory, we may well end up by eliminating a true, and accepting a\nfalse, theory. (Lakatos 1978: 24)\n\n\nSecond, Popper\u2019s theory of demarcation hinges quite\nfundamentally on the assumption that there are such things as critical\ntests, which either falsify a theory, or give it a strong measure of\ncorroboration. Popper himself is fond of citing, as an example of such\na critical test, the resolution, by Adams and Leverrier, of the\nproblem which the anomalous orbit of Uranus posed for nineteenth\ncentury astronomers. They independently came to the conclusion that,\nassuming Newtonian mechanics to be precisely correct, the observed\ndivergence in the elliptical orbit of Uranus could be explained if the\nexistence of a seventh, as yet unobserved outer planet was posited.\nFurther, they were able, again within the framework of Newtonian\nmechanics, to calculate the precise position of the \u201cnew\u201d\nplanet. Thus when subsequent research by Galle at the Berlin\nobservatory revealed that such a planet (Neptune) did in fact exist,\nand was situated precisely where Adams and Leverrier had calculated,\nthis was hailed as by all and sundry as a magnificent triumph for\nNewtonian physics: in Popperian terms, Newton\u2019s theory had been\nsubjected to a critical test, and had passed with flying colours.\n\nYet Lakatos flatly denies that there are critical tests, in the\nPopperian sense, in science, and argues the point convincingly by\nturning the above example of an alleged critical test on its head.\nWhat, he asks, would have happened if Galle had not found the\nplanet Neptune? Would Newtonian physics have been abandoned, or would\nNewton\u2019s theory have been falsified? The answer is clearly not,\nfor Galle\u2019s failure could have been attributed to any number of\ncauses other than the falsity of Newtonian physics (e.g., the\ninterference of the earth\u2019s atmosphere with the telescope, the\nexistence of an asteroid belt which hides the new planet from the\nearth, etc). The suggestion is that the\n\u201cfalsification/corroboration\u201d disjunction offered by\nPopper is unjustifiable binary: non-corroboration is not necessarily\nfalsification, and falsification of a high-level scientific theory is\nnever brought about by an isolated observation or set of observations.\nSuch theories are, it is now widely accepted, highly resistant to\nfalsification; they are \u201ctenaciously protected from refutation\nby a vast \u2018protective belt\u2019 of auxiliary hypotheses\u201d\n(Lakatos 1978: 4) and so are falsified, if at all, not by Popperian\ncritical tests, but rather within the elaborate context of the\nresearch programmes associated with them gradually grinding to a halt.\nPopper\u2019s distinction between the logic of falsifiability and its\napplied methodology does not in the end do full justice to the fact\nthat all high-level theories grow and live despite the existence of\nanomalies (i.e., events/phenomena which are incompatible with them).\nThese, Lakatos suggests, are not usually taken by the working\nscientist as an indication that the theory in question is false. On\nthe contrary, in the context of a progressive research programme he or\nshe will necessarily assume that the auxiliary hypotheses which are\nassociated with the theory can in time be modified to incorporate, and\nthereby explain, recalcitrant phenomena.\n\nThird, Popper\u2019s critique of Marxism has not, of course, gone\nunchallenged. The debate arising from, however, has in many cases\ntended to revolve around ideological rather than philosophical issues,\nwhich will be passed over here. However, there have also been some\ntrenchant philosophical responses. Cornforth sees Marxism as a\nrational scientific discipline and Marxian thinking as \u201ca\nrational and scientific approach to social problems\u201d (Cornforth\n1968: 6) of the kind which both Marx and Popper consider important.\nConsequently, he takes Popper to task for representing Marxism as a\nsystem of dogmas designed to close minds or pre-empt the operation of\nour rational faculties in addressing social issues. Against that view,\nhe argues that it constitutes a way of thinking designed to open minds\nto the real possibilities of human life, and sees it as the philosophy\nbest calculated to promote the ideals of the open society to which he,\nlike Popper, subscribes. Hudelson (1980) argues that Marxian economics\nsurvives the Popperian critique of historicism and that, in any case,\nMarx did not hold many of the tenets of historicism identified by\nPopper. He also contends that Popper fails to show that there cannot\nbe, and that we cannot know, laws of social development and that Marx\ndid not in fact confuse trends and laws in the way that Popper\nsuggests.\n\nFourth, In the case of Freudian psychoanalysis, the adequacy of\nPopper\u2019s critique has been challenged on philosophical grounds\nby a number of commentators, particularly Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum (1984).\nGr\u00fcnbaum is highly critical, indeed scornful, of Popper\u2019s\ndismissal of the claims of psychoanalysis to be scientific and argues\nthat Freud showed \u201ca keen appreciation of methodological\npitfalls that are commonly laid at his door by critics\u201d\n(Gr\u00fcnbaum 1984: 168) such as Popper. He argues that Freud was\nsensitive to the question of the logic of the confirmation and\ndisconfirmation of psychoanalytic interpretations and cites\nFreud\u2019s use of the concept of consilience, the convergence of\nevidence from disparate sources, as a serious and explicit attempt to\nmeet the requirements of that logic. For Gr\u00fcnbaum, Popper\u2019s\ncritique of Freud amounts a veritable parody of the pioneering thinker\nwho established the discipline of psychoanalysis, and he attributes\nthat to Popper\u2019s \u201cobliviousness to Freud\u2019s actual\nwritings\u201d (1984: 124). He points out, for example, that the case\nof the drowning child which Popper uses in Conjectures and\nRefutations (Popper 1963: 35), upon which he rests part of his\ncase against psychoanalysis, is contrived and not in any way derived\nfrom Freud\u2019s actual clinical texts.\n\nGr\u00fcnbaum contends that there are instances in Freud\u2019s\nwritings where he shows himself to be \u201ca sophisticated\nscientific methodologist\u201d (Gr\u00fcnbaum 1984: 128), keenly\naware of the need for his theoretical system to meet the requirement\nof testability. One such occurs when Freud, in his assessment that\nanxiety neuroses are due to disturbances in sexual life, explicitly\nrefers to the notion of falsifiability: \u201cMy theory can only be\nrefuted when I have been shown phobias where sexual life is\nnormal\u201d (Freud 1895 [1962: 134]). Another occurs in\nFreud\u2019s 1915 paper \u201cA Case of Paranoia Running Counter to\nthe Psycho-Analytic Theory of the Disease\u201d, in which, as the\ntitle suggests, he saw the patient\u2019s collection of symptoms as\npotentially falsifying the theory. Moreover, Freud\u2019s entire\naccount of paranoia as being due to an underlying repressed\nhomosexuality is open to empirical refutation, Gr\u00fcnbaum argues,\nsince it has the testable implication that a reduction in rates of\nparanoia should result from a removal or loosening of social sanctions\nagainst same-sex relationships (1984: 111).\n\nGr\u00fcnbaum accordingly holds that Freudian theory should be\nconsidered falsifiable and therefore genuinely\nscientific\u2014albeit, in his view, ultimately unsuccessful, because\nthe clinical evidence offered in its favour is contaminated by\nsuggestion on the part of the analyst and cannot therefore support its\nconceptual weight. That is a verdict very different to what\nGr\u00fcnbaum sees as the reductive dismissal of Freud offered by\nPopper: \u201cthe inability of certain philosophers of science to\nhave discerned any testable consequences of Freud\u2019s\ntheory\u201d, he concludes, \u201cbetokens their insufficient\ncommand or scrutiny of its logical content rather than a scientific\nliability of psychoanalysis\u201d (1984: 113).\n\nThere can be little doubt of the seriousness of this challenge to\nPopper\u2019s critique of the claims of psychoanalytic theory to\nscientific status. Further, the unparalleled cultural impact of\nFreudianism upon contemporary life can scarcely be denied, and even a\ncursory examination of the vast corpus of Freud\u2019s works reveals\na thinker of quite extraordinary theoretical power and imagination\nwhose claims to scientific validity cannot be dismissed lightly.\n\nHowever, while the detail of this psychoanalytic response to Popper is\ncontestable, what is perhaps most striking and important about it is\nthat, as articulated by Gr\u00fcnbaum, it is itself couched in broad\nterms of an acceptance of a Popperian account of science. That is to\nsay, in rejecting the claim that psychoanalysis fails to meet the\nstandard of falsifiability specified by Popper,\nGr\u00fcnbaum\u2014who also rejects the hermeneutic interpretation of\nFreud offered by thinkers such as Paul Ricoeur and Jurgen\nHabermas\u2014nonetheless implicitly accepts that very standard, and\nwith it the broad sweep of Popper\u2019s theory of demarcation. For\nthat reason alone, it seems clear that Popper\u2019s work will\ncontinue to function as a critical reference point in the ongoing\ndebate regarding the scientific status of Freudian thought.\n\nFifth, scientific laws are usually expressed by universal statements\n(i.e., they take the logical form \u201cAll As are\nX\u201d, or some equivalent) which are therefore concealed\nconditionals\u2014they have to be understood as hypothetical\nstatements asserting what would be the case under certain ideal\nconditions. In themselves they are not existential in nature. Thus\n\u201cAll As are X\u201d means \u201cIf anything\nis an A, then it is X\u201d. Since scientific laws\nare non-existential in nature, they logically cannot in themselves\nimply any basic statements, since the latter are explicitly\nexistential. The question arises, then, as to how any basic statement\ncan falsify a scientific law, given that basic statements are not\ndeducible from scientific laws in themselves? Popper answers that\nscientific laws are always taken in conjunction with statements\noutlining the \u201cinitial conditions\u201d of the system under\ninvestigation; these latter, which are singular existential\nstatements, yield hard and fast implications when combined with the\nscientific law.\n\nThis reply is adequate only if it is true, as Popper assumes, that\nsingular existential statements will always do the work of bridging\nthe gap between a universal theory and a prediction. Hilary Putnam in\nparticular has argued that this assumption is false, in that in some\ncases at least the statements required to bridge this gap (which he\ncalls \u201cauxiliary hypotheses\u201d) are general rather than\nparticular, and consequently that when the prediction turns out to be\nfalse we have no way of knowing whether this is due to the falsity of\nthe scientific law or the falsity of the auxiliary hypotheses. The\nworking scientist, Putnam argues (Putnam 1974; see also the 1991\nreprinting with its retrospective note), always initially assumes that\nit is the latter, which shows not only that, but also why, scientific\nlaws are, contra Popper, highly resistant to falsification,\nas Kuhn (1962) and Lakatos (1970, 1978) have also argued.\n\nPopper\u2019s final position is that he acknowledges that it is\nimpossible to discriminate science from non-science on the basis of\nthe falsifiability of the scientific statements alone; he recognises\nthat scientific theories are predictive, and consequently prohibitive,\nonly when taken in conjunction with auxiliary hypotheses, and he also\nrecognises that readjustment or modification of the latter is an\nintegral part of scientific practice. Hence his final concern is to\noutline conditions which indicate when such modification is genuinely\nscientific, and when it is merely ad hoc. This is itself\nclearly a major alteration in his position, and arguably represents a\nsubstantial retraction on his part: Marxism can no longer be dismissed\nas \u201cunscientific\u201d simply because its advocates preserved\nthe theory from falsification by modifying it\u2014for in general\nterms, such a procedure, it transpires, is perfectly respectable\nscientific practice. It is now condemned as unscientific by Popper\nbecause the only rationale for the modifications which were made to\nthe original theory was to ensure that it evaded falsification, and so\nsuch modifications were ad hoc, rather than scientific. This\ncontention\u2014though not at all implausible\u2014has, to hostile\neyes, a somewhat contrived air about it, and is unlikely to worry the\nconvinced Marxist. On the other hand, the shift in Popper\u2019s own\nbasic position is taken by some critics as an indicator that\nfalsificationism, for all its apparent merits, fares no better in the\nfinal analysis than verificationism.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature: Works by Popper", "Secondary Literature/Other Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature: Works by Popper": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1928, <em>Zur Methodenfrage der Denkpsychologie</em>, Ph.D.\nDissertation, University of Vienna, unpublished.", "1935, <em>Logik der Forschung</em>, Vienna: Julius Springer\nVerlag.", "1944\u201345, \u201cThe Poverty of Historicism\u201d,\n<em>Economica</em>, Part 1, 11(42): 86\u2013103; Part II, 11(43):\n119\u2013137; Part III, 12(46): 69\u201389. doi:10.2307/2549642\ndoi:10.2307/2550285 doi:10.2307/2549898", "1945, <em>The Open Society and Its Enemies</em>, 2 volumes,\nLondon: Routledge.
