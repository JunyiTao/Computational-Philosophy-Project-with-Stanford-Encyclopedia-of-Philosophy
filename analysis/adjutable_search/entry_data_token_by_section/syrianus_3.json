References to and citations from\nphilosophical works abound (Plato, minor Platonists, Aristotle), and\nthere are no good reasons to doubt that this commentary was in fact\nwritten by Syrianus the Neoplatonist, most probably before he assumed\nfull leadership of the Academy. The work is addressed to the\nauthor\u2019s favorite son Alexander (2, 3f.), who was presumably\nbeing honed to become an orator (rather than a philosopher). The work,\nalthough containing no philosophical argument, deserves closer study\nas it is full of references to major and minor authors, providing good\nevidence for the vitality of the literary tradition as a backdrop for\npagan philosophy in late antiquity.\n",
