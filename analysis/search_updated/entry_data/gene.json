    "preamble": "\n\nMany biologists and commentators from the humanities and social\nsciences have questioned whether the gene is still a useful category\nin biology. Too many times have the entities and processes associated\nwith the term turned out to be more diverse and more complex than\ninitially assumed, and it seemed that new terms were needed to\naccommodate new insights. And yet, the term \u201cgene\u201d has\nproved to be persistent. It remains central not only in public\ndiscourse about biology and in educational contexts, but also for\nresearchers at the cutting edge of the life sciences in framing their\nresults and interpretations.\n\nTo understand this seemingly paradoxical situation, it is worthwhile\nto reflect on the nature of scientific concepts. Most, if not all\nscientific concepts are historically constituted, i.e., they are\nneither given once, with a unique and stable meaning attached to them\nand either remain in discourse unchanged or disappear entirely, nor\nare they merely subject of historical development in the sense of\nprogressing towards some final, stable meaning. Instead, concepts are\n\u201cin flux\u201d; they change their meaning in the course of\nongoing investigation (Elkana 1970). Additionally, when the\ninvestigative projects associated with a concept diversify, concepts\nmay at any point in history exhibit several related but still\ndifferent meanings in various local contexts. In each context, the\nconcept might be more or less well defined, but overall, or at the\nboundaries between different fields of research, concepts will be\nperceived as rather vague (L\u00f6wy 1992). Furthermore, scientific\nconcepts do not stand isolated; they belong to conceptual systems,\ndiscourses, and practices (Foucault 1971; Kuhn 1962; Lynch 1993).\nIndeed, what it means for a concept to change its meaning is that the\ncontext of use for a given concept or its relations to other concepts\nchange. All of the above applies to the gene concept, which has been\ndescribed as a \u201cconcept in flux\u201d (Falk 1986), a fuzzy,\nvague, or boundary concept (Rheinberger 2000), and a \u201cconcept in\ntension\u201d (Falk 2000), and studied as part of various discourses\n(Jacob 1970 [1973]; Keller 2000) or in the context of broader cultural\nspheres and practices (M\u00fcller-Wille & Rheinberger 2012).\n\nThe first part of this entry provides a historical overview, which\nserves as a background to understand philosophical accounts of\nscientific change with respect to genetics addressed in the second\npart. Section 2.1 will discuss models of theory reduction in genetics.\nSections 2.2 and 2.3 will address discussions of change and\ndiversification in the meaning and reference of the term\n\u201cgene\u201d. Because of its central role in most areas of\nbiology, the gene concept also has a central role in debates in\nphilosophy of biology (see entries on\n philosophy of biology\n and \n feminist philosophy of biology).\n This entry focusses on the gene\nconcept in studies of heredity and development. Additional\nphilosophical problems concerning the concept of genetic information,\ncausation, and determinism are covered in entries on\n biological information,\n genetics,\n molecular genetics,\n molecular biology,\n the distinction between innate and acquired characteristics,\n and\n the human genome project\n (see also Griffiths & Stotz 2013). For conceptual questions\npertaining to genes as central units of evolution, the reader is\nreferred to the entries on\n evolution,\n ecological genetics,\n population genetics,\n genetic drift,\n units and levels of selection,\n and\n replication and reproduction\n (see also Sterelny & Griffiths 1999).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. A History of the Gene Within the History of Genetics\n1.1 From Mendel\u2019s methods to Mendelism\n\nThe question of biological heredity emerged in the nineteenth century\nin diverse fields of practice and gave rise to various theories, which\noften aimed to provide a unified view of heredity, development, and\nevolution (M\u00fcller-Wille & Rheinberger 2012: Chs. 2\u20135).\nGregor Mendel (1822\u20131884) did not aim at a unifying theory, nor\ndid he set out to discover laws governing heredity. Historians have\nargued, instead, that he was concerned with specific questions\nregarding the role of hybridization in evolution (Olby 1979; cf.\nM\u00fcller-Wille 2018). Other hybridists had crossed plants of\ndifferent species and varieties, studied their offspring, and asked\nwhether new species could emerge in this process. Issues regarding the\nclassification of hybrids emerged: how did hybrids resulting from\ncrosses between pure species differ from offspring of parent organisms\nthat were hybrids themselves; and how could their characteristics be\ninterpreted with respect to those of their parents when it came to\ndetermining their type? Mendel (1866 [2016]) aimed to address such\nquestions in his experiments with garden peas and in this respect was\nindeed indebted to his predecessors. Nonetheless, he introduced\nseveral changes in the experimental system employed by the hybridists\nthat allowed him to arrive at more specific results regarding the\ndistribution of types in several generations of offspring\n(M\u00fcller-Wille & Orel 2007). First, he concentrated on\nvarieties that differed only in one or a few characteristics. This\nenabled him to move from classifying the offspring according to type\nto a focus on the distribution of traits that characterized the types.\nSecond, he made sure that he obtained offspring in numbers that\nallowed for a statistical treatment of the distribution of characters.\nIn this way, he was able to observe regularities in the appearance of\ntypes in the third generation (plants resulting from crosses between\nhybrids) that previous hybridists where not able to detect. Finally,\nhe developed a notation system where letters represented types of germ\ncells, which he used to record his results and compare them with\ntheoretical predictions. These innovations enabled Mendel to arrive at\na set of regularities regarding\n\nthe uniform appearance of a \u201cdominant\u201d character in\nthe first generation,\nthe segregation of the dominant and alternative,\n\u201crecessive\u201d characters in a ratio 3:1 in the second\ngeneration, representing one pure dominant, two hybrids, showing the\ndominant character, and one pure recessive, and\nthe independent inheritance of separate character pairs.\n\n\nMendel\u2019s refined methodology was the basis for important\nconceptual innovations. Next to the shift from \u201cforms\u201d or\n\u201ctypes\u201d found in several generations in hybridization\nexperiments to the distribution of characters, Mendel could move from\nthe characterization of the contribution of gametes (also addressed as\n\u201cfactors\u201d) to the \u201celements\u201d by which the\ngametes differed (M\u00fcller-Wille & Orel 2007). Nonetheless,\nMendel did not think of the regularities as laws of heredity. Indeed,\nwhether they were valid for organisms other than the garden pea he\nconsidered subject to empirical investigation. Furthermore, Mendel\nthought of his results as illuminating the behavior of characters in\nhybrids, i.e., he did not generalize his results to heredity per\nse, as it would occur in the reproduction of all characters, also\nin pure varieties (Rheinberger & M\u00fcller-Wille 2018: Ch.\n3).\n\nIn 1900, several botanists independently arrived at similar results in\ntheir hybridization experiments and at the same time took notice of\nMendel\u2019s original work and stated its significance in their\nrespective publications (Olby 1966: Ch. 6). This brought the Mendelian\napproach and way of reasoning to the attention of those who worked\nwith experimental crosses in contexts of either theoretical questions\nregarding heredity and evolution or applied problems of horticulture\nand scientific breeding (Bowler 1989a: Ch. 6). Much had changed in\nbiology since Mendel\u2019s days: first, the idea that the hereditary\nmaterial is passed on independently of somatic development, codified\nin August Weismann\u2019s (1834\u20131914) germ-line theory, was\nwell established; second, several researchers had developed a\ncytological interpretation of hereditary phenomena; third, in the late\nnineteenth century various ideas on how to identify units transmitted\nthrough germ cells had emerged. Furthermore, on a broader social and\neconomic scale, processes of industrialization and rationalization of\nfood production, vaccines, and other applications had led to an\nincreased demand for standardized biological materials\n(M\u00fcller-Wille & Rheinberger 2012: Ch. 6). In this context,\nthe entities and regularities identified by hybridization experiments\nwere now taken to be the basis of heredity in general.\n\nThe early \u201cMendelians\u201d employed and expanded\nMendel\u2019s experimental system, notation, and terminology (Shan\n2020). They codified Mendel\u2019s regularities as \u201claws\u201d\nof heredity, while at the same time investigating exceptions to\nuniformity or dominance (e.g., \u201cblending\u201d characters), to\nthe ratios of segregation (e.g., due to \u201ccomposite\u201d\ncharacters, which came to be seen as influenced by several factors),\nand to independent assortment in crosses involving several characters\n(e.g., because characters appeared to be \u201ccoupled\u201d).\nMendel\u2019s experiments, perceived as exemplars for the study of\nvariation and heredity, named \u201cgenetics\u201d by William\nBateson (1861\u20131926; 1907), played an important role for the\nformation of both the field and its central concept, the gene. Bateson\nemphasized the idea that discrete \u201cunit-characters\u201d could\nbe identified in organisms, which occurred in alternative forms or\n\u201callelomorphs\u201d. In crosses these characters segregated in\nMendelian ratios. This indicated and was explained by assuming the\n\u201cpurity of gametes\u201d, i.e., the fact that reproductive\ncells can transmit only one form of a character. When two gametes that\nwere alike with respect to one character united, the resulting zygote\nwas \u201chomozygous\u201d for this character, otherwise it was\n\u201cheterozygous\u201d. While these observations were initially\ndiscussed mainly in terms of characters and types of gametes or the\ngametes\u2019 ability to transmit characters, Bateson came to think\nof the dominant allelomorph as being determined by some\n\u201cfactor\u201d present in the gamete, while the recessive\ncharacter resulted when the factor was absent in both gametes (Darden\n1991: Ch. 6; Schwartz 2002). \u201cFactor\u201d thus came to be\nused\u00a0by many Mendelians similarly to Mendel\u2019s\n\u201celements\u201d. The term referred to whatever made two gametes\ndifferent regarding the inheritance of characters, but it was not\nconnected to any specific theory regarding the physical nature of the\nhereditary material.\n\nThere were also alternatives to the Mendelian view of heredity. The\nbiometric approach, going back to the work of Francis Galton\n(1822\u20131911) and further developed by W.F.R. Weldon\n(1860\u20131906) and Karl Pearson (1857\u20131936), used advanced\nstatistical tools to investigate heredity in terms of correlations\nbetween characters in successive generations in limited populations\n(Porter 1986: Ch. 9). Weldon and Pearson adhered to an orthodox\ninterpretation of Charles Darwin\u2019s (1809\u20131882) view that\nevolution proceeded by natural selection acting on gradual variation.\nMendelians, instead, focused on discontinuous variation (Bowler 1992;\nGayon 1998). Wilhelm Johannsen (1857\u20131927) had conducted\nexperiments with \u201cpure lines\u201d, in which he selected the\nplus or minus variants of quantitative characters such as seed size in\nthe offspring of self-fertilized beans (Johannsen 1903). Based on his\nresults, Johannsen distinguished between fluctuating variation, which\nwas due to contingent influences of the environment, and variation\nbetween types, which remained stable unless changed in a discontinuous\nmanner through mutation (Roll-Hansen 2009). Around that time, Hugo de\nVries (1848\u20131935; 1901\u20131903) suggested the concept of\nmutation to account for the spontaneous emergence of new stable types.\nEven though many did not follow de Vries\u2019 idea of large-scale\nchanges affecting several characters at once, giving rise to a new\nspecies instantaneously, most Mendelians came to think that the\ncharacter variation they observed occurred spontaneously through\nchanges in factors as units of the hereditary material (Bowler 1992:\nCh. 8).\n\nInitially, some Mendelians doubted the purity of gametes and concluded\nthat the maternal and paternal gametes \u201ccontaminated\u201d each\nother regarding the factors by which they differed, thus allowing for\ncontinuous variation. However, various researchers were able to\nresolve the question by showing how several factors affected the same\nquantitatively characterized character in cumulative manner (Carlson\n1966: Chs. 4\u20135; Darden 1991: Chs. 6\u20137). Around 1910,\nmodels of \u201cmulti-factorial inheritance\u201d explained modes of\ninheritance of continuously varying characters based on discontinuous\ngenetic variation. These and other developments led to a convergence\nof biometric approaches and Mendelism and the emergence of\nmathematical population genetics in the 1920s and 30s, a field that\nlaid the foundations for genetic models of the effects of selection\nand other processes of evolution (Allen 1978: Ch. V, Part II; Bowler\n1989b: Ch. 11; Provine 1971; entries on\n population genetics\n and\n ecological genetics).\n1.2 Classical and physiological genetics\n\nMuch of population genetics relied on an abstract concept of the gene\nas a unit inferred through character differences, represented in a\nsymbolism, and used in the mathematical reconstruction or prediction\nof patterns of variation in theoretical, experimental, or natural\nbreeding populations. In the early years of genetics, there was no\nagreement regarding the possibility of identifying units of the\nhereditary material and characterizing their nature and function.\nConsiderations in this direction did not differ much from the\nspeculative theories of the nineteenth century and were indeed mainly\ninformed by them. In 1909 Johannsen coined the term\n\u201cgene\u201d, derived from de Vries\u2019s term\n\u201cpangene\u201d, to disentangle the concept of the hereditary\nunit from any specific theory:\n\n\nIt is meant to express merely the simple idea that\n\u201csomething\u201d in the gametes can condition or take part in\nthe determination of a property of a developing organism. (Johannsen\n1909: 124, author\u2019s translation)\n\n\nWith respect to his selection experiments mentioned above, Johannsen\nhad furthermore introduced the distinctions between phenotype and\ngenotype. The former concept initially captured the range of\nfluctuating variation in a quantitative character centering on an\naverage value that characterized a pure line. Later, however, the term\nwas used with respect to an individual\u2019s characteristics for\nboth quantitative and qualitative differences in type. The genotype\nwas the genetically relevant constitution of the germ cells or zygote,\nin other words, the sum of the genes, where genes could only be\nidentified as bearing differences between genotypes resulting in\nphenotypic differences. The phenotype was the result of the\ninteraction of the genotype with the environment in ontogenesis\n(Meunier 2016a; entry on\n the genotype/phenotype distinction).\n The phenotype of the parents, let alone of more distant ancestors,\nthus had no effect on the offspring. The genotype was what passed from\nparents to offspring. Johannsen defined heredity \u201cas the\npresence of identical genes in ancestors and descendants\u201d\n(Johannsen 1911: 159).\n\nParadoxically, the rejection of speculations about the nature and\nfunctioning of hereditary units advocated by Johannsen opened the\npossibility for its investigation as an epistemic object. By\nseparating genes and characters more clearly and treating them as\ncorrelated in terms of differences rather than in terms of growth or\nproduction implied in \u201cAnlage\u201d and similar earlier\nconcepts, characters could take on the epistemic function of an\n\u201cindex\u201d or \u201cmarker\u201d informative of the genetic\ncomposition of gametes and zygotes (Meunier 2016b; Schwartz 2000). The\ngene began to take shape as a material entity when this inferential\nstrategy was combined with observations from microscopic studies of\nreproductive cells that enabled inferences on the role of chromosomes\nin heredity.\n\nIn 1910\u20131911, Thomas Hunt Morgan (1856\u20131945) observed\nseveral mutants in his stocks of Drosophila melanogaster.\nWhen he analyzed these mutants through Mendelian crosses, he found\nthat they were partially linked regarding their inheritance, i.e., the\ncharacters were inherited together in more than the 50% of cases that\nwould be expected if genes were randomly distributed, but in less than\n100% of the cases, which would have suggested that both characters\ndepend on the same gene. Indeed, Morgan found that his characters\ncould be recombined, despite the fact that they were all sex-linked,\ni.e., the genes were associated with whatever determined sex in the\nfruit fly. As every gene was present in two instances (later called\n\u201calleles\u201d), the linkage groups could be assumed to exist\nin pairs and recombination thus suggested exchange between\ncorresponding linkage groups, or \u201ccrossing over\u201d of genes.\nThis again suggested that linked genes appeared in linear order, with\nthe frequency of crossing over between two genes being an indicator of\ntheir proximity. Other characters were found that also formed such\nlinkage groups but were not sex-linked. Based on these assumptions,\nMorgan and his students were able to construct maps of four linkage\ngroups in Drosophila that represented the linear order and\nrelative distance as inferred from recombination frequencies (Carlson\n1966: Ch. 6\u20137).\n\nWhile this account of genes was derived from genetic evidence, i.e.,\nMendelian crosses, the results could be mechanistically explained with\nreference to chromosomes. Chromosomes had been suggested as containing\nhereditary material before, but evidence was not forthcoming until the\nearly twentieth century. Cytologists had been able to observe the\nbehavior of chromosomes the formation of gametes and draw analogies to\nthe segregation and independent assortment of Mendelian units. They\ndemonstrated the role of chromosomes in the determination of sex and\nmade observations which suggested an exchange of materials between\nhomologous chromosomes (Brush 1978; Carlson 1966: Ch. 6; Crow &\nCrow 2002). On this basis, the Morgan group\u2019s account identified\nlinkage groups with chromosomes (Morgan et al. 1915; Vorms 2014). By\nthe 1930s, cytological observations had reached a resolution that\nenabled researchers to correlate genetic linkage map loci with\nphysical landmarks in the chromosomes, leading to cytological maps,\nwhich further facilitated the study of chromosomes in heredity (Falk\n2004; Gannett & Griesemer 2004).\n\nIn this tradition, often referred to as \u201cclassical\ngenetics\u201d, genes were hypothetical material units of the genetic\nmaterial, located in the chromosomes. But unlike the material carriers\nof heredity assumed in the nineteenth century, they did not give rise\nto characters in a straightforward manner. Many-many relations between\ngenes and characters became obvious early on. All characters were\ninfluenced by many genes (polygenic) and most genes affected many\ncharacters (pleiotropic). The only kind of causal statement that was\njustified was that a difference in a gene resulted in one or more\ndifferences on the phenotypic level (Schwartz 2000).\n\nSome questioned the chromosome theory of heredity and the notion of\nseparable corpuscular genes. For instance, in the light of the\n\u201cposition effect\u201d, where genes had different effects\ndepending on their location in the chromosome, Richard Goldschmidt\n(1878\u20131958; 1938) suggested a holistic view of chromosomal\nagency (Allen 1974; Carlson 1966: Chs. 13\u201315). Furthermore,\nwhether justified or not, many embryologists interpreted genetics as a\nform of preformationism, the view that organisms or their parts were\nin some way already given or at least pre-determined in the fertilized\negg or its nucleus, such that development would be the mere\narticulation of the given structures. This interpretation was at odds\nwith the view held by most embryologists, that the organism is the\nresult of a process referred to as epigenesis, in which nucleus,\ncytoplasm and environment interact to transform material and\nstructures (see the entry on\n theories of biological development).\n\nOn their part, geneticists became increasingly interested in the\nchemical nature of genes and their roles in metabolism and\ndevelopment. Several researchers had emphasized analogies between gene\naction and enzyme mediated chemical reactions (Ravin 1977). Using\ntheir terminology, Hermann Muller (1890\u20131967) and others\nobserved that the gene had two characteristics that needed to be\nelucidated. First, it was autocatalytic, i.e., it was capable of\nreproducing itself for cell division and heredity to happen; second,\nit was heterocatalytic, i.e., it was able to facilitate the production\nof other chemical materials to perform its function (Muller 1922,\n1947). What was peculiar regarding the first aspect was that genes\nwere still capable of autocatalysis when they underwent mutational\nchange, and they faithfully reproduced the alteration. Hence, for\nMuller, mutation was the key to the material nature of the gene. In\nthe late 1920s, he and others were able to establish the mutagenic\nagency of radiation (Muller 1927; see Campos 2015: Chs. 5\u20136).\nThe fact that genes could be \u201chit\u201d and changed through\nX-rays supported the idea that they were individual entities that\ncould be physically and chemically characterized.\n\nTo address the immediate chemical function of genes in the cell, i.e.,\ntheir heterocatalytic properties, it was necessary to conceive of the\nphenotype itself in chemical terms. In 1908 Archibald Garrod\n(1857\u20131936; 1909) had found that some medical conditions that\ncould be associated with \u201cerrors in metabolism\u201d were\ninherited in a Mendelian fashion. Subsequently, physiological\ngeneticists studied the relation of genes and catalytic activities.\nConclusive evidence was achieved when George Beadle (1903\u20131989)\nand Edward Tatum (1909\u20131975) used the bread mold Neurospora\ncrassa to search for mutants that affected known nutritional\npathways by growing the fungi on selective media that provided or\nlacked certain substances. This approach established the field of\nbiochemical genetics and stabilized the one gene\u2014one enzyme\nhypothesis, i.e., the view that every gene was involved in the\nproduction of a specific enzyme, which had a specific effect on\ncellular metabolism (Kay 1993: Ch. 7; Kohler 1994: Ch. 7).\n1.3 Molecular genetics: From DNA to protein\n\nAs much as these achievements of genetic analysis pushed the gene in\nthe biochemical or molecular domain, they were not able to elucidate\nthe chemical nature of the gene and its immediate action. This\nrequired other experimental systems, which began to take shape in the\n1930s to 1950s (Morange 2020, Part One). For instance, Max\nDelbr\u00fcck (1906\u20131981) and others turned to T-phages (viruses\nthat infect the bacterium e.coli) because they assumed that\nviruses were essentially \u201cnaked genes\u201d. While these\nresearchers were able to show that genetic phenomena (mutation,\nexchange of genetic material) were present in viruses and bacteria as\nwell and to achieve higher resolution of analysis, this work remained\nas formal as Drosophila genetics. It was only through\nintegrating new technologies from physics and chemistry into the new\nexperimental systems that microbial genetics led to molecular\ngenetics. Results from biochemical work in biomedical microbiology and\nfrom work involving radioactive isotopes to label biological molecules\nprovided evidence that DNA might be the genetic material.\n\nSeveral researchers turned their efforts to elucidating the structure\nof DNA (Judson 1979: Ch. 2; Morange 2020: Ch.11; Olby 1974: Section\nV). Among them were James Watson (born 1928) and Francis Crick\n(1916\u20132004). They used data from DNA X-ray crystallography\nproduced by Maurice Wilkins (1916\u20132004), Rosalind Franklin\n(1920\u20131958), and co-workers, and adopted the style of reasoning\nand use of ball-and-stick models of molecules pioneered by Linus\nPauling (1901\u20131994). DNA was already known to consist of a\nsugar-phosphate structure and the four bases cytosine (C), guanine\n(G), adenine (A) or thymine (T). Based on additional evidence, Watson\nand Crick eventually came to consider a double helix model with the\nbases on the inside and a pairing of A with T and G with C, which was\npublished in April 1953. Shortly thereafter they published another\npaper which spelled out the consequences for genetics (Watson &\nCrick 1953a,b). The model suggested a mechanism of DNA replication\naccording to which the two chains of the DNA separate and each\nacquires a novel complementary strand on the basis of base pair\ncomplementarity. Hence it explained the previously postulated\nautocatalytic properties of genes. Seymour Benzer (1921\u20132007),\nworking with phage was able to push the resolution of genetic analysis\nto a level below the gene, by mapping mutation loci within genes\n(Holmes 2006). His work supported the DNA model as it showed that not\nonly genes, but also their components were arranged in a linear\nsequence and suggested that single bases could be the locus of\nmutation. Benzer concluded that the understanding of the classical\ngene as unit of mutation, recombination and function needed to be\nrevised (Benzer 1957). He suggested the novel terms\n\u201cmuton\u201d, \u201crecon\u201d and \u201ccistron,\u201d\nwhere only the latter gained some currency to refer to genes as units\nof function.\n\nThe acceptance of DNA as genetic material and of its structure brought\nthe search for the material basis of genes to an end. Subsequently,\nthe focus shifted on the question of how genes realized their\nheterocatalytic capacities. At this point, the question was reframed\nin terms of protein synthesis (Judson 1979: Ch. 6; Morange 2020: Ch.\n12). Proteins consist of one or several polypeptide chains, which are\ncomposed of amino acids. In the early 1950s, Frederick Sanger\n(1918\u20132013) had determined the amino acid sequence for\npolypeptides of insulin (Chadarevian 1996). On this basis, Crick\nre-defined the problem by observing that\n\n\n[t]he actual chemical step by which any two amino acids [\u2026] are\njoined together is probably always the same [\u2026].\n\n\nTherefore, the aspect of protein synthesis in need of explanation\nwas\n\n\nthat only a single standard set of twenty amino acids can be\nincorporated, and that for any particular protein the amino acids\nmust be joined up in the right order.\n\n\nIn other words, it was\n\n\nthe problem of \u201csequentialization\u201d. (Crick 1958: 144)\n\n\nIn response to this problem Crick formulated the sequence hypothesis,\nwhich assumed\n\n\nthat the specificity of a piece of nucleic acid [i.e., a stretch of\nDNA or RNA] is expressed solely by the sequence of its bases, and that\nthis sequence is a (simple) code for the amino acid sequence of a\nparticular protein. (1958: 152)\n\n\nThe three-dimensional conformation of the protein was then seen as\nemerging spontaneously as a function of its sequence. Additionally,\nCrick formulated what he called the \u201ccentral dogma\u201d,\nregarding the directionality of the relation of DNA\u2019s sequence\nof bases and proteins\u2019 sequence of amino acids:\n\n\n[The central dogma] states that once \u201cinformation\u201d has\npassed into protein it cannot get out again. In more detail,\nthe transfer of information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid, or from\nnucleic acid to protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to\nprotein, or from protein to nucleic acid is impossible. (1958:\n153)\n\n\nThe language of \u201cinformation\u201d and \u201ccode\u201d had\nentered genetics only recently and from several sources. One was Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s (1887\u20131961) What is life?\n(1944), where he spoke of a \u201ccode-script\u201d; another was the\nbroader cold war techno-cultural context of cryptography, computer\nscience, and cybernetics (Kay 2000; Keller 2000). In this context,\nbefore the early 1960s, most authors treated the problem of the role\nof DNA in protein synthesis in a theoretical manner, relying on\nmathematical and cryptographic considerations, and using computers to\nsolve the combinatorial puzzle. Although some theoretical insights and\nmuch of the language developed at this time was important for later\ndevelopments, these attempts by geneticists were ultimately\nunsuccessful (Sarkar 1996; Stegmann 2021).\n\nBiochemists at the time were equally convinced that genes played an\nimportant role in protein synthesis (Judson 1979: Ch. 6 and 8; Morange\n2020: Ch. 12; Rheinberger 1997). New evidence emerged from the medical\ngenetics and biochemistry of sickle cell anemia, indicating the\nrelation of gene mutations and amino acid alterations, from in\nvitro systems of protein synthesis based on e.coli cell\nextracts, leading to the characterization of ribosomes and transfer\nRNA (tRNA), as well as from work establishing the existence and role\nof messenger RNA (mRNA) and its complementarity to DNA. The image that\nresulted from this diverse evidence was that mRNA transferred\ninformation from nuclear DNA to the cytoplasm, where ribosomes, as\nlargely unchanged structures, facilitated the assembly of amino acid\nchains based on the sequence of mRNA. In 1961, Crick and co-workers\nshowed experimentally that three bases code for one amino acid, that\ncoding triplets do not overlap and that they are read from a fixed\nstarting point. In the same year, Marshall Nirenberg (1927\u20132010)\nand Heinrich Matthaei (born 1929) published results from an experiment\nin which synthetic RNA consisting only of uracil bases (RNA contains\nuracil, instead of thymine) was introduced in a cell free protein\nsynthesis system, resulting in the production of a monotonous protein\nconsisting of the amino acid Phenylalanine. Thus, it was shown that\nthe RNA triplet UUU coded for this amino acid. This result opened the\npossibility to solve the genetic code experimentally and several labs\nparticipated in this project, leading to a complete table of\ncorrelated codons (coding triplets) and amino acids by 1967.\n1.4 Molecular biology: DNA technology, development, and evolution\n\nMolecular technologies and concepts inevitably had a transforming\ninfluence on other fields. Indeed, it might be argued, that while\nmolecular genetics constituted a discipline centered on a limited\nnumber of questions regarding the molecular basis of heredity,\nmolecular biology is best understood as a set of techniques and\napproaches that came to be applied in various disciplines (Burian\n1993).\n\nIn the classical period of molecular genetics, many central mechanisms\npertaining to DNA replication, gene regulation, and protein synthesis\nwere described. While DNA served as a template in its own replication,\nit was not self-replicating or autocatalytic; many enzymes and other\nmolecules were required in this process, such as DNA polymerase and\nDNA ligase. Furthermore, around 1970, several enzymes specific for\nbacteria or viruses were described such as reverse transcriptase,\nwhich enabled viruses to translate RNA into DNA, and restriction\nenzymes, which cleaved DNA as part of a bacterial defense system. Next\nto explaining important cellular processes, taken together, these\nenzymes could be used as a toolkit to manipulate DNA in\nvitro, in bacterial systems and eventually also in eukaryotic\ncells. In 1972, Paul Berg (born 1926) and colleagues published a study\ndemonstrating the possibility to construct DNA molecules from\nfragments originating from different organisms by using these enzymes\nas tools (Jackson et al. 1972). These molecular tools not only led to\nrecombinant DNA technology and genetic engineering, but also\nfacilitated the further molecular characterization of genes by\nisolating and amplifying them in bacteria (molecular cloning) (Morange\n2020: Ch. 16).\n\nMolecular technologies changed the way research was done in molecular\nbiology. In vitro systems that helped among other things to\nsolve the genetic code, were complemented by new methods of in\nvivo manipulation and detection (Rheinberger 2009). This in turn\nled to the discovery of new cellular mechanisms involved in the\ntranscription and translation of genes. For instance, it had been\nobserved in virus-based model systems that in some cases mRNA\ncorresponded to non-contiguous fragments of the DNA from which it was\ntranscribed. Further studies revealed that in these cases parts of the\ninitial transcript were removed to form the mature mRNA that was\neventually translated and the segments that were removed could\nseparate coding regions. Much to the surprise of biologists, this was\nthe case for all genes in eukaryotic cells, while the mechanism was\nabsent in prokaryotes (Abir-Am 2020; Morange 2020: Ch. 17).\n\u201cSplit genes\u201d and the mechanism of RNA splicing led to an\nimportant reconception of genes. As Walter Gilbert (born 1932)\nwrote:\n\n\nThe notion of the cistron, the genetic unit of function that one\nthought corresponded to a polypeptide chain, now must be replaced by\nthat of a transcription unit containing regions which will be lost\nfrom the mature messenger which I suggest we call introns (for\nintragenic regions)\u2014alternating with regions which will be\nexpressed\u2014exons. (W. Gilbert 1978: 501)\n\n\nGilbert\u2019s terminology was widely accepted and it became clear\nthat exons could be spliced together in alternative ways, thus\nmultiplying the number of proteins that could be derived from a\nstretch of DNA. During the 1970s and 80s, further mechanisms of RNA\nprocessing were discovered in various organisms. For instance, mRNA\ncould be generated by splicing together exons from several\ntranscripts, from either the same or adjacent loci or even from\ndifferent chromosomes (\u201ctrans-splicing\u201d). Furthermore, RNA\ncould be edited by changing several or single nucleotides, which could\nhave large effects on the proteins translated from the mRNA. Mobile\nelements in the genome (transposons), already characterized by Barbara\nMcClintock (1902\u20131992) in Maize in the early 1950s by classical\ngenetic means, were also studied in bacteria and molecularly\ncharacterized around 1980 (Comfort 2001). It was not always\nimmediately clear how general these and other mechanisms were (and it\nis still investigated). Nonetheless, it transpired that the notion\nthat one gene, understood as an unequivocally localized stretch of\nDNA, corresponded to one polypeptide, had to be abandoned (Fogle 2000;\nPortin 2002).\n\nAnother important development concerned gene regulation. Studying the\nability of bacteria to adapt to varying food sources, Fran\u00e7ois\nJacob (1920\u20132013) and Jacques Monod (1910\u20131976) developed\nthe operon model, according to which a protein called\n\u201crepressor\u201d is permanently produced, which binds to a DNA\nregion called \u201coperator\u201d in the vicinity of the genes\nrequired for lactose metabolism, thereby inhibiting the production of\nthe respective enzymes and other proteins. If lactose was present, it\n(or a derivate) interacts with the repressor such that the genes are\nactivated, and lactose could be digested by the bacteria. This model\nintroduced an important distinction regarding genes. Those genes that\ncoded for \u03b2-galactosidase or lactose permease or other proteins\nconstituting cellular functions were called \u201cstructural\ngenes\u201d. The genes that produced the repressor and other proteins\ncontrolling the expression of genes were called \u201cregulatory\ngenes\u201d (Jacob & Monod 1961).\n\nThis kind of mechanism was immediately interpreted as providing\nanswers to the question how different genes become activated at\ndifferent times and in different tissues during metazoan development\n(differential gene expression). Between the 1950s and the 1980s the\nconcept of specific developmental genes emerged (Morange 2001: Ch. 7).\nDevelopmental biologists identified a limited number of genes that\nwere essential in establishing the organization of the very early\nembryo and functioned by controlling the expression of various other\ngenes. Molecular cloning led to the molecular characterization of\ndevelopmental genes and the discovery of their evolutionary\nconservation (Weber 2004, see also the entry on \n developmental biology).\n\nEvolutionary biology as well became molecularized\n(Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz 2018). One important contribution was the\ntheory of the molecular clock, which stated that the rate of\nevolutionary change in a protein remained constant such that the time\nof divergence of lineages could be estimated from data on amino acid\nsequences (Morgan 1998). This lent support to and was explained by the\nneutral theory of molecular evolution suggested, which was\ncontroversially discussed between molecular and traditional biologists\nin the 1960s (Dietrich 1998; entries on\n ecological genetics\n and\n genetic drift).\n In general, molecular biology opened a new perspective on\nevolutionary mechanisms, for instance, the notion that evolution\nbuilds upon events of duplication of genes, chromosomes, or whole\ngenomes. On this view the duplicated elements could acquire new\nfunctions or alter the dosage of gene products (Morange 2020, Ch.\n23).\n1.5 Genomics and post-genomics\n\nIn the late 1970s, Sanger developed methods for sequencing DNA. The\n1980s then saw the automation of these methods (Garc\u00eda-Sancho\n2012). This made\u00a0whole genome sequencing of humans and other\norganisms feasible, and the Human Genome Project (HGP) commenced work\nin 1990 (Bostanci 2004; entry on\n the human genome project).\n New parallel, or \u201cnext generation\u201d, sequencing methods\nthat emerged around 2005 made sequencing faster and cheaper.\nAccordingly, the number of species and human samples sequenced\nincreased continually. Since the early days of protein sequencing,\nsequence data was stored in digital databases, with GenBank being\namong the most important sequence repositories (Strasser 2019).\nGenomics, the science of analyzing and comparing genomes was thus\nstrongly aligned with bioinformatics. Sequence comparison once more\ntransformed evolutionary genetics and enabled new comparative\napproaches; now the DNA sequence itself could be used to reconstruct\nphylogenetic trees, and patterns of duplication events could be\ntracked in more detail (Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz 2010). Microbial\nsystematics and ecology, in particular, changed significantly when\nmetagenomic approaches, i.e., the sequencing of whole microbial\ncommunities, revealed not only the diversity of microbial life, but\nalso the amount of lateral gene transfer between organisms, including\neukaryotes (O\u2019Malley 2014). But the availability of large data\nsets on human genomes also fostered novel interest in human diversity\nand history, enhanced medical genetics and the use of genetic data in\nforensics, and led to the emergence of direct-to-consumer genetic\ntesting (Atkinson et al. 2009; Gibbon et al. 2018).\n\nOne of the unexpected results of the HGP was that the human genome\ncontained only about 23,000 protein-coding genes as defined based on\nthe concept of an open reading frame (ORF), that is, a stretch of DNA\nthat begins with a start and ends with stop codon that initiate and\nterminate translation. Other, apparently less complex organisms, had\nas many or even more genes (thus defined) in their genomes (G-value\nparadox). This fact again suggested the significance of splicing\nvariants and other mechanisms increasing the number of proteins\nderived from a given genome, of regulatory elements in the genome, and\nof non-coding RNA (see entry on\n genomics and postgenomics).\n In 2003 the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project was\ninitiated, aiming at identifying all functional elements in the human\ngenome including those transcribed to non-protein-coding RNA, and\nsites for protein binding or epigenetic modification (Brzovi\u0107\n& \u0160ustar 2020). The results of the consortium\u2019s work\nmade the already known deviations from the classic model of the\nmolecular, protein-coding gene appear as the rule rather than the\nexception. To a large extent ENCODE researchers found overlap of\ntranscripts, products derived from widely separated pieces of DNA\nsequence and widely dispersed regulatory sequences for a given gene.\nThe findings also confirm that most of the genome is transcribed and\nemphasize the importance and pervasiveness of functional non-coding\nRNA transcripts (Morange 2020: Ch. 25; O\u2019Malley et al. 2010;\nVeigl 2021).\n\nThese developments belong to what is commonly referred to as\n\u201cpost-genomics\u201d (Richardson & Stevens 2015). Next to\nDNA, so-called \u201comics\u201d research studies the transcriptome,\nthe proteome, the interactome, and other levels of cellular processes\nand is strongly driven by new technological developments. DNA and\nprotein microarrays (biochips) have been instrumental in this respect,\nand the investigation of RNA transcripts has been even further\nenhanced by next generation RNA sequencing (Rheinberger &\nM\u00fcller-Wille 2018: Ch. 9). Such high-throughput technologies\nresult in massive amounts of diverse types of data. Bio-ontologies,\nand database infrastructures and curation, accordingly, became a\ncentral aspect of molecular biological research (Leonelli 2016).\n\nWhile relevant mechanisms were first characterized in the 1960s and\n70s, omics-approaches have furthered the study of cellular\nepigenetics, referring to molecular mechanisms including DNA\nmethylation, changes in chromatin structure, and non-coding RNA\nrelated regulation (Buklijas 2018; Morange 2020: Ch. 26; Nicoglou\n& Merlin 2017). These mechanisms can result in patterns of\ndifferential gene expression that remain stable across mitotic cell\ndivision, thus contributing to the explanation of development.\nEpigenetic modifications have also been shown to be conserved in\nmeiosis, facilitating the inheritance of phenotypic variation across\ngenerations, independently of changes in DNA sequence, a fact with\nconsequences for evolutionary biology (Jablonka & Raz 2009).\n\nThe availability of data sets also enabled new, technology-driven\nstyles of biological research (Morange 2020: Ch. 28; Rheinberger &\nM\u00fcller-Wille 2018: Ch. 9; entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n Systems biology emerged as a highly interdisciplinary field, which is\ncharacterized by mathematical and computational approaches to the\ntopology and dynamics of interaction networks involving genes and gene\nproducts. In a complementary manner, synthetic biology focuses on\nengineering metabolic pathways and regulatory networks for\nbiotechnological applications such as drug or biofuel production, but\nalso to increase the understanding of molecular systems (Kastenhofer\n2013). The CRISPR-Cas system, originally elucidated as a bacterial\nimmune defense mechanism, was developed into a new tool for genome\nediting, which, due to its precision, also enhanced genetic\nengineering approaches in multicellular organisms (Morange 2020: Ch.\n24).\n\nIt becomes clear that biological research remains dynamic and that\nevery development sheds new light on questions of heredity and the\nfunctioning of DNA. With the developments presented in this part in\nmind, we shall now turn to some of the philosophical debates they have\nengendered.\n2. Philosophical Accounts of Scientific Change in Genetics\n2.1 Theory change and reductionism in genetics\n\nThe developments in genetics sketched in Part 1 prompted the question\nhow philosophical models of scientific change could be applied to the\ncase of biology from the late nineteenth century to the present, as\nthey had been developed mainly based on cases from modern physics and\nchemistry and preceding traditions in natural philosophy. Were the\nmajor transitions in hereditary thought to be described as scientific\nrevolutions (see entries on\n scientific revolutions\n and\n the incommensurability of scientific theories)?\n It seems that models of change emphasizing discontinuity and\nincommensurability among successive paradigms, such as Thomas\nKuhn\u2019s (1962), do not fit well with what can be observed in the\nhistory of genetics: Much terminology and many practices seem to\nremain intact despite constant theoretical novelty, and the\ndevelopments do not appear to be perceived as discontinuous in a\nstrong sense by the protagonists. Continuous models of change,\ndeveloped earlier by logical empiricists and centered on the notion of\nreduction as a relation between earlier and later theories, were thus\ndiscussed as possible alternatives with respect to the history of\ngenetics.\n\n\u201cReductionism\u201d in genetics can, on the one hand, refer to\nphilosophical positions regarding theory reduction or reductive\nexplanation. On the other hand, attitudes in biology and philosophy\nthat are characterized by a preference for molecular over organismic\naccounts of biological phenomena or an emphasis on genes in\nexplanations have been labeled \u201creductionist\u201d (see entry\non\n reductionism in biology).\n The latter, broader meaning overlaps with notions of \u201cgenetic\ndeterminism\u201d and, more generally, \u201cgene-centrism\u201d.\nThis section focuses on the former, technical meanings of\n\u201creduction\u201d. The debate on reduction got contemporary\nphilosophy of biology started around 1970 and is still on-going today\n(Vidal & Teira 2020; Winther 2009). Theory reduction is most\nprominently articulated by Ernest Nagel (1961). Put very simply, on\nNagel\u2019s account, one theory reduces to another if the former can\nbe logically derived from the latter, or, in terms of a\nnomological-deductive model of explanation, if the reducing theory\nexplains the reduced theory. Since, on this view, the relation between\ntheories is one between sets of statements, including, most\nimportantly, laws or law-like generalizations, successful reduction\nalso requires \u201cbridge principles\u201d or coordinating\ndefinitions, which indicate how the vocabularies (terms or predicates)\nof the two theories relate (see entry on\n scientific reduction).\n\nKenneth Schaffner (1967, 1969) further develops Nagel\u2019s account\nby pointing out that the candidate reduced theory typically needs to\nbe corrected before it can be reduced. He then applies his model to\nthe case of genetics. On Schaffner\u2019s view, molecular genetics\nreduced or is in the process of reducing classical genetics (see\n \u00a71.2\n and\n \u00a71.3\n for an account of classical and molecular genetics). On his account,\nthe genes of classical genetics can be identified with DNA sequences.\nFurthermore, concepts that capture law-like generalizations about\nphenomena in classical genetics (e.g., dominance) can be explained\nthrough generalizations on the molecular level. Schaffner\u2019s\naccount is met with criticism by David Hull (1972, 1974). Hull\u2019s\nmost influential objection rests on a multiple realizability argument.\nHe argues that the types of phenomena identified in classical genetics\n(such as dominance) can be instantiated by a variety of different\nmolecular constellations. Furthermore, Hull points out that any\nmolecular entity or mechanism can be involved in various types of\nsituations as described in classical genetics. Accordingly, Hull\ndiagnoses many-many relations between molecular phenomena and\nphenomena identified through cytological and phenotypic analysis.\n\nAlexander Rosenberg (1978; 1985: Ch. 4) argues that Mendelian\nproperties supervene on molecular properties, i.e., that for any\ndifference in Mendelian properties there is a difference in molecular\nproperties. Thus, even if theory reduction is not available, the facts\nof Mendelian genetics can be ontologically reduced to facts of\nmolecular genetics. Others describe this situation by observing that\nwhile token-token reduction is possible, type-type reduction is not to\nbe had (Kimbrough 1979). Closer to a Kuhnian notion of\nincommensurability is Michael Ruse\u2019s (1971) reconstruction,\naccording to which the Mendelian gene and the molecular gene are\nincompatible concepts. One reason is that the former was treated as a\nunit of function, recombination, and mutation, while the latter is\nnot. Furthermore, molecular genetics explains everything that is\nexplained by Mendelian genetics and more; it has more explanatory\npower and is more accurate. Hence, according to Ruse, molecular\ngenetics does not reduce, but replaces Mendelian genetics. Others\ndefend the thesis that Mendelian genetics in its original version is\nreduced by molecular genetics (e.g., Goosens 1978).\n\nAnother, influential set of challenges to theory reduction in genetics\nis posed by Philip Kitcher (1984). The main problem, and indeed one\nthat is fundamental to any account of theory reduction that identifies\ntheories with sets of laws, is that there are no laws in classical\ngenetics. Even seemingly straightforward examples such as what came to\nbe called \u201cMendel\u2019s laws\u201d, as Kitcher shows, are\nneither laws, nor do they play an important explanatory role in\nclassical genetics. Kitcher further argues that the basic predicates\nof classical genetics, such as \u201cx is a gene\u201d\ncannot be unequivocally connected to the vocabulary of molecular\ngenetics through bridge principles, as it would be required for\nsuccessful theory reduction. Finally, even if these two issues were\nsolved, an account based on the principles of molecular genetics would\nnot explain the phenomena of classical genetics any better than the\ncytological explanations already in place. Others argue against this\ndisunified picture of Mendelian and molecular genetics that the two\nfields depend on each other in their practices. This interdependence,\nhowever, also precludes an eliminative reduction (i.e., replacement)\n(Vance 1996).\n\nSeveral authors suggest that the debates on in-principle reducibility\nare far removed from explanatory practice in molecular genetics.\nWimsatt (1974) highlights theories of inter-level relations and how\nthey facilitate mechanistic explanations (see the entry on \n mechanisms in science). \n Pointing towards a sematic view of theory, which holds that\ntheories are families of related models, Waters (1990, 1994) maintains\nthat molecular genetics provides explanations for phenomena described\nby Mendelian theory. The basis for this is that both fields rely on\nthe principle that only phenotypic differences in a population, rather\nthan the presence of traits is explained by genes (or rather by\ngenetic differences). While these authors still speak of theoretical\nreduction, theory has changed its status. Rather than one theory\ncontaining laws being reduced by another theory through logical\ndeduction, theory is conceived in terms of explanatory models which\nmediate the conceptual and practical relations between Mendelian and\nmolecular genetics.\n\nSubsequently, the emphasis of philosophical debates shifts more\ntowards explanatory reduction (H\u00fcttemann & Love 2011; Kaiser\n2015; Rosenberg 2006; Sarkar 1998). The question becomes less one of\nthe relations between Mendelian genetics and molecular genetics, but\nrather whether organismic phenomena from heredity to development to\nevolution can or should be explained in molecular terms (see\n \u00a71.4).\n\nThis section was concerned with the relation of the theories in which\ngene concepts are embedded from the perspective of scientific change.\nThe next section will address scientific change on the level of the\ngene concept itself, where the focus is on the question to what extent\nsuch concepts remain constant regarding reference and meaning when\ntheories and practices change.\n2.2 Conceptual change and the gene concept\n\nAbout the time when philosophers of science turned to biology, a new\ntheory of meaning was widely discussed\u2014the causal theory of\nreference (Kripke 1972; Putnam 1975; see entries on\n reference\n and\n natural kinds).\n Proponents of this view turned against earlier theories of reference,\nwhich they took to hold that the reference of a token (an instance of\na term\u2019s use) is fixed by a description of the referent the\nspeaker has in mind and that represents the term\u2019s meaning.\nInstead, according to the new theory, a natural kind term, and\nespecially a scientific term, is connected to a kind of entity when it\nis used for the first time to refer to an instance as belonging to a\ncertain natural kind by an ostensive gesture or an equivalent.\nSpeakers might then use a scientific term to refer to a natural kind,\neven if they are not able to identify a member of the kind in question\nor have false beliefs about this kind of entity. They rely on the fact\nthat there are experts in their broader linguistic community who can\nidentify members of the kind in question in the way it was initially\nintroduced, and who stand in a suitable causal relation with the event\nof the original naming of the kind through a series of communicative\nlinks. The initial identification of a kind might have been based on\nrecognizing some salient shared properties (\u201cnominal\nessence\u201d in Locke\u2019s terms;\n Locke on real essences).\n However, if the introduction of the term has indeed successfully\nidentified a natural kind, then, eventually, the \u201creal\nessence\u201d of the kind will be identified, presumably in form of\nthe physical microstructure, which explains the initially recognized\nproperties. The latter still play a role in characterizing a\nstereotype for non-expert speakers, but based on the underlying causal\nproperties experts can determine kind membership unequivocally in\nevery case (Putnam 1975).\n\nBased on such a view, the dependence of the reference of theoretical\nterms in science on a description or on its relation to a currently\naccepted theory can be avoided. This is what made causal theories of\nreference attractive to philosophers of biology, who saw continuity in\nthe use of the term \u201cgene\u201d despite significant theoretical\nshifts in genetics during the twentieth century. This view suggests\nthe following narrative regarding the events presented in Part 1:\nMendel had identified a natural kind when he identified gametic\nelements involved in the inheritance of characters. Early Mendelians\nused a variety of terms but referred to the same entity when\nperforming hybridization experiments. Later the units were named\n\u201cgenes\u201d but the communicative chain connecting earlier and\nlater uses of the terms referring to entities belonging to the natural\nkind remained intact. And even if the meaning of the concept changed,\ni.e., various properties shared by the members of the kind were\nsuggested or dropped from the list of necessary and sufficient\ncriteria, eventually, a molecular characterization of genes was\nachieved, which explained the most stable observed properties (or\ntheir variation under varying conditions) and was since available for\nexpert geneticists to determine whether something was a gene or not.\nMuch of the debate sketched in the following can be described as\ndiscussing to what extent this narrative is adequate.\n\nKitcher takes causal theories of reference as his starting point to\ndiscuss conceptual change in the case of the gene concept (1982). He\nintroduces the notion of reference potential of a term type, which on\nhis account comprises several ways in which the reference of a token\nis fixed. On the one hand, there are several modes of reference and\nthey are correlated with the intention of the speakers. Sometimes a\nspeaker might value clarity and hence provide a description that fixes\nthe reference of a term in the sense of descriptivist theories of\nreference. Indeed, researchers or teachers often provide definitions\nof the term \u201cgene\u201d. The description might turn out to be\nwrong, however, and hence the term might fail to refer, but at least\nthe speaker made it transparent in which sense the term is used. In\nother situations, a speaker might want to conform to the established\nuse of a term in a community. In this case the reference is fixed in\nthe way suggested by causal theories of reference; in using the term\nthe speaker relies on the existence of experts in the broader language\ncommunity, who know how the term is applied correctly (i.e., how a\nmember of the natural kind is identified). These experts are causally\nconnected to the initial event of the term\u2019s introduction. This\nis the way most people use the term \u201cgene\u201d. Finally,\nspeakers might refer to an entity in a situation where they are in\ndirect causal interaction with it. This might be the case when\nresearchers refer to genes in research articles reporting experiments\ninvolving genes.\n \nOn the other hand, and this is what expands the reference potential of\na concept, there are various descriptions available, which speakers\nmight use to fix the reference of the term\n\u201cgene\u201d. Furthermore, there are several causal trajectories\nby which various groups of experts are connected to situations where\nthe term was introduced by something akin to ostension. Finally, there\nare always new situations in which researchers refer by ostension in\ndirect interaction with genes, possibly based on new kinds of\nexperiments. Conceptual change for Kitcher is thus constituted by\nchanges in the reference potential of a concept, in this case, in the\nways tokens of the term \u201cgene\u201d refer to genes (if they\nrefer at all).\n\nWhen applying theories of reference, philosophers typically commit to\nrealism of some form. This means that they assume that there are\nnatural kinds and that a concept, when it refers successfully, picks\nout some natural kind. When dealing with complex matters such as the\nphenomena of heredity, there are certainly several natural kinds to be\nidentified. Hence, according to Kitcher, not only the reference\npotential of a concept changes, but also the reference of the concept\nitself. Earlier as well as later uses of the term \u201cgene\u201d\nmight have referred successfully, but the extensions of the term in\nearlier and later instances might nonetheless have been different.\nMendelians might have picked out the natural kind of, say, chromosomal\nelements that are potential difference makers with respect to\nheritable phenotypic variation when using the term. This kind\ncomprises protein-coding DNA sequences and some non-coding regions.\nMolecular geneticists might have picked out another natural kind, say,\ntemplate for functional molecules, which did not include some of the\nelements referred to as genes by Mendelians, but protein-coding DNA\nsequences as well as sequences coding for functional RNA. While this\nopens the door to a form of pluralism regarding genes as natural\nkinds, Kitcher connects his account to a notion of progress. He\nmaintains that the reference potential of the gene concept improved.\nDescriptions that failed to fix reference were rejected and causal\ntrajectories going back to the ostensive introduction of a term that\nturned out to have failed to pick out a natural kind or picked a\nnatural kind no longer held to be significant are cut. In\nKitcher\u2019s view molecular genetics refined the concept of the\ngene. The notions of failure of reference and improvement of the\nreference potential are of course dependent on the status of molecular\nbiological knowledge at a given time, which provides the baseline for\nthe evaluation of concepts (Weber 2005: Ch. 7; for developments since\nKitcher\u2019s writing, see\n \u00a71.5).\n\nRichard Burian (1985), like Kitcher, is concerned with the facts that\ntheoretical terms can pick out natural kinds even when a theory turns\nout to be mistaken and that researchers who disagree in their theories\ncan use a concept that refers to the same natural kind. Burian\nillustrates these points with the case of Bateson, who held\ntheoretical views that are now seen as false (e.g., regarding the\npresence/absence hypothesis, see\n \u00a71.1),\n but who is still taken to have referred successfully to genes on most\noccasions where he used the term or synonyms. Furthermore, Bateson was\nable to discuss the chromosome theory held by the Morgan group (see\n \u00a71.2),\n despite rejecting it. This only makes sense if it is assumed that\ndespite disagreement, both parties used the term \u201cgene\u201d to\nrefer to the same natural kind. Burian aims at a hybrid account\ncombining extensionalist views based on causal theories of reference\nand intensionalist views relying on the notion of theoretical\ndescriptions. Theoretical differences among accounts put forward by\nvarious groups simultaneously or across time can thus be bridged by a\ngene concept exhibiting \u201creferential openness\u201d achieved by\nindefinite, rather schematic descriptions that are not committed to\nthe material nature of genes but nonetheless characterize them through\ntheir causal effects and in that sense operationalize the concept.\nWhile such concepts facilitate continuity in scientific change, any\ngiven research project will operate with a specification of the\ndescription that provides criteria to individuate genes and that\nrelies on a mix of functional and structural characterizations. How\ngenes are identified depends among other things on how and on what\nlevel the phenotype is determined (e.g., as qualitative or\nquantitative, molecular or morphological). Such specific gene concepts\nthen account for the discontinuities observed in the history of\ngenetics (Burian 1985; [1995] 2005). In the light of the complex\ncellular processes in which DNA is involved, both Kitcher and Burian\nsuggest that molecular biologists ultimately study the genetic\nmaterial rather than genes, but importantly, they are still interested\nin functional units; a gene then becomes \u201canything a competent\nbiologist chooses to call a gene\u201d (Kitcher 1992: 131). Genomics\nor post-genomics can be understood as enhancing this shift (see\n \u00a71.5;\n Dupr\u00e9 2004; Stotz et al. 2006; entry on\n genomics and postgenomics).\n\nMarcel Weber (2005: Ch. 7) begins his discussion of reference and\nconceptual change in genetics by drawing on Kitcher\u2019s account of\nchanging modes of reference and reference potentials, following Burian\nin emphasizing the important role of meaning in terms of descriptions\nor theoretical beliefs. Weber then presents a more fine-grained series\nof conceptual changes, driven by the introduction of new investigative\ntechniques or new experimental organisms (esp. bacteria and phage),\nand observes that the reference potential (including theoretical\nbeliefs) as well as the extension of the term \u201cgene\u201d\nchanged continuously. Weber describes a situation where a broad\nextension based on the causal effects observed in Mendelian crossing\nexperiments is narrowed down when additional criteria are introduced\nin classical, chromosome-based genetics, broadened again to include\nbacteria and viruses, and narrowed down again to sequences of DNA that\ndetermine the sequence of proteins (see\n \u00a7\u00a71.1\u20131.3).\n Furthermore, in different contexts researchers could interpret the\nmolecular characterization differently, for instance, including or\nexcluding regulatory sequences.\n\nBecause of this diachronic and synchronic variation in gene concepts,\nWeber speaks of \u201cfloating reference\u201d, highlighting\npermanent change in the reference potential and shifts in reference.\nThis fact, according to Weber, is explained by metaphysical\nconsiderations regarding the nature of biological objects. Evolution\nproduces variation; this is true also for genetic material. As a\nresult, genetic material exhibits kinds in the sense of classes of\nobjects that share some causal disposition, but it can nonetheless be\ndivided in various ways. Hence different historical and contemporary\ngene concepts identify different kinds depending on the methods and\ninterests of researchers. Apart from the different ways to identify\ncausally relevant classes of objects, any such class contains objects\nnone of which is exactly like the other. The gene concept is thus\ncomparable to the species concept (Weber 2014; see entry on\n species).\n\nFurthermore, Weber moves from general characterizations of concepts to\nan empirical study of reference to particular genes in\nDrosophila in the context of investigative practices in\ngenetics, such as the molecular cloning of genes in the context of\ndevelopmental biology (see\n \u00a71.4).\n Even though reference and description of classical and various\nversions of molecular gene concepts differ, it turns out that the\nclassical concept is utilized in identifying genes (e.g., those\ninvolved in the organization of the fly embryo), which are then made\nsubject to molecular characterization (Weber 2005: Ch 7; see also\nWaters 1994). Thus, despite a lack of complete co-extension of the\nclassical and the molecular gene concepts, partial referential\ncontinuity plays a significant role in mediating investigative\npractices.\n\nThe importance of investigative practices highlighted by Weber is also\nemphasized by Ingo Brigandt (2010). He suggests that the content of\ntheoretical concepts consists of three elements: a concept\u2019s\nreference; its inferential role, which he construes similarly to\nKitcher\u2019s reference potential; and its epistemic goal, which he\nspecifies as the theoretical, explanatory, and investigative aims that\nare facilitated using a given concept. Brigandt argues that change of\nor variation in the inferential role of a concept is rational when the\ninferences or explanations supported by the revised concept support a\ngiven epistemic goal better than an earlier or an alternative version.\nThe epistemic goals associated with a concept can change as well,\ntypically, according to Brigandt, in a gradual manner. From this\nperspective, Brigandt reconstructs a continuous shift in the goals\npursued by researchers using the gene concept, from classical\ngenetics, which pursued the epistemic goal of predicting patterns of\ninheritance to molecular genetics\u2019 focus on the goal of\nexplaining how genes bring about their molecular products, through\nvarious intermediate goals, such as understanding the influence of\ngenes on cell metabolism (see\n \u00a7\u00a71.2\u20131.3).\n Furthermore, the account addresses the variety of gene concepts\nemerging in the last 30 years (see\n \u00a71.5).\n While the epistemic goal connected to the gene concept in\ncontemporary molecular genetics remains similar to that associated\nwith the classical molecular gene, i.e., to elucidate how DNA\ncontributes to functional RNA and protein, reference and inferential\nrole are specific to various research contexts. More recent\ndiscussions of conceptual change in biology have not focused on genes,\nbut on related concepts such as dominance (Shan 2020) or lineage (Neto\n2020).\n\nThe next section focuses on the simultaneous use of various gene\nconcepts in contemporary biology rather than the succession of gene\nconcepts.\n2.3 The plurality of gene concepts in contemporary biology\n2.3.1 The instrumental and the molecular gene\n\nThe gene concept that structured the work of early Mendelism and\nchromosomal genetics is referred to as \u201cinstrumental gene\u201d\n(Falk 1986; Griffiths & Stotz 2006). Geneticists routinely\nidentified genes based on phenotypic differences in hybridization\nexperiments or the analysis of pedigrees (see\n \u00a71.2).\n Differences between, first germ cells, and, later, more specifically,\nbetween chromosomes, had to be assumed to explain patterns of\nphenotypic correlation between sexually reproducing organisms and\ntheir offspring. These units of difference in the genetic material\ncould also, and more importantly, be used to predict phenotypes. For\nthese purposes, it was not necessary to know what exactly their\nphysical location or material composition was. In this sense, the\nconcept was instrumental. In a similar way, Lenny Moss (2003: Ch. 1)\ncharacterizes the gene-P as a gene defined by its phenotypic effect\nand used for prediction (the \u201cP\u201d can thus stand for\n\u201cphenotype\u201d or \u201cprediction\u201d, but Moss also\npoints out that the concept is associated with instrumental\npreformationism).\n\nOnce the tools of molecular genetics were in place, for each case the\ngenetic difference correlated with the phenotypic difference could be\nlocated in the DNA and hence the genes of classical genetics could be\nmolecularized (Waters 1994). The instrumental gene (as a unit that\ncorrelates with a phenotypic difference, segregates in a Mendelian\nmanner, and is subject to recombination events) can remain\nindeterminate regarding DNA-sequence and need not correspond to a gene\nthat has an identifiable product. In many cases one of the genetic\nvariants consists in the absence or lack of a function of a gene\nproduct and there are many ways in which a change in DNA can result in\nthe lack of a resource (Moss 2003: Ch. 1). The instrumental gene can\ncorrespond to elements of various size, including whole chromosome\naberrations, and they might be located in coding regions as much as in\nregulatory elements or even insulator regions that only function to\nseparate other functional elements, as long as a difference in\u00a0\nthe sequence is correlated with a phenotypic effect (Griffiths &\nStotz 2006).\n\nThe concept of the gene analyzed in terms of instrumental genes, or\ngenes-P, is still widely used in many contexts such as evolutionary\nbiology, agricultural breeding, or medicine (even though it might play\nout differently in the identification of genetic traits and in\nevolutionary theory, respectively; see Gifford 2000; S. Gilbert 2000).\nThe instrumental gene thus exists along-side other gene concepts which\nemphasize the material basis and immediate biochemical roles of\ngenes.\n\nMolecular genetics gave rise to what has been called the\n\u201cclassical molecular gene\u201d concept (Neumann-Held 1999, see\n \u00a7\u00a71.3\u20131.4).\n The classical molecular gene was characterized both structurally and\nfunctionally in the following way: A gene exhibits a certain structure\nknown as an \u201copen reading frame\u201d (ORF), that is, a\nsequence of codons between and including a start and a stop codon,\nwhich initiate and terminate translation respectively (i.e., they\nexhibit their function in the transcribed RNA, but can be identified\nin the corresponding DNA). Also, transcription and translation\ninitiation and determination signals, such as transcription factor\nbinding sites and other regulatory elements typically associated with\nprotein-coding genes were often seen as part of the molecular gene\n(forming a \u201ctranscription unit\u201d). The function of such a\nmolecularly described gene was to give rise (via mRNA) to a\npolypeptide chain as the basis of a functional protein through the\nprocesses of transcription and translation. The gene fulfilled this\nfunction by acting as a template. Complications such as splicing or\noverlapping genes were initially not seen as compromising the\nstructural-functional unity of the material gene. Non-coding,\nfunctional RNA could also be assimilated to the concept, if it was\npossible to identify a stretch of DNA based on linear correspondence\nbetween the product and its gene (Griffiths & Stotz 2006).\n\nIn the molecular realm, yet another gene concept, gene-D, can be\nidentified, which is characterized in contrast to the gene-P and\ncaptures a situation in which researchers identify genes as\ndevelopmental resources (Moss 2003: Ch. 1). Genes-D are typically\nclassical molecular genes, but here the emphasis is on function rather\nthan structure and especially on function beyond the initial role as\ntemplate. As pointed out by Weber (2005: Ch. 7), researchers\u2019\nattention is often initially guided towards a part of DNA sequence\nconceptualized as gene-P, that is, as associated with phenotypic\nvariation. Once the relevant gene is cloned and the regulatory\nnetworks in which it is involved as well as the activities of its\nproduct are investigated, it frequently becomes clear that it is\nexpressed in many tissues, in different contexts and at different\ntimes (see\n \u00a71.4).\n Furthermore, the locus in question often functions as template for a\nlarge variety of products. Hence, while the gene-P is indeterminate\nwith respect to sequence, the gene-D is indeterminate with respect to\nphenotype. Addressing a gene as gene-D means to investigate its\nvarious roles in the process of epigenesis. The fact that the absence\nof one or several of these products leads to phenotypic change does\nnot imply that the resource is more important in the development of\nthe structure exhibiting the phenotype than the large number of other\ngenes involved and their respective products. Instead, the phenotype\nshows how the developmental process responds to the absence of a\nresource. The fallacious notion of genes for a certain trait (e.g.,\nblue eyes) containing developmental information (e.g., for making blue\neyes) results when biologists (or commentators) conflate the separate\nnotions that genes-D contain template information and that genes-P\ncontain predictive information (Moss 2003: Ch. 1 and 2). While\n\u201cgene for\u201d talk is misleading in the context of\ndevelopment (Kampourakis 2017), the notion has been defended in the\ncontext of evolution (Kaplan & Pigliucci 2001).\n\nThe classical molecular gene concept was closely related to the\nnotions of genetic information and the genetic code (see\n \u00a71.3\n and entry on\n biological information).\n While some philosophers have described these terms as potentially\nmisleading metaphors (Sarkar 1996), many see these concepts either as\nused in a literal sense and hence justified (Godfrey-Smith 2000), or\nas metaphorical, but productive (Levy 2011). The details of an\nadequate explication are much debated (e.g., Stegmann 2005), but on\nthe level of molecular phenotypes (mainly proteins) the information\nconcept is seen as relatively uncontroversial. More debated is the\nquestion if information, or the notion of causal specificity that it\nimplies, is a unique property of DNA or if it applies to other\ncellular and extra-cellular components as well (Baxter 2019; Bourrat\n2020; Griffiths & Stotz 2013: Ch. 4\u20136; Griffiths et al.\n2015; Waters 2007; Weber 2017; Woodward 2010). On the level of whole\norganism phenotypes, genetic information has been explicated in terms\nof teleosemantic theories borrowed from philosophy of mind and\nemphasizing the selected function of genes (Maynard Smith 2000;\nSterelny et al. 1996). The parity thesis, stating that non-genetic\nfactors can carry information in the same sense has been suggested on\nthis level as well (Griffiths 2001). Other philosophers have discussed\nthe question of whether selected function would not be better located\non the level of the developing organism as the receiver of information\n(Jablonka 2002) or if a notion of genetic representation can be\nreformulated in terms of transmission in an intergenerational\ninformation producer and consumer system (Shea 2013; cf. K\u00f5iv\n2020; Planer 2016).\n\nFrom a broader perspective, it has been argued that information talk\nin genetics results in the persistence of genetic determinism (Oyama\n[1985] 2000). The latter notion expresses the idea that an organism\nwill exhibit a trait if it carries certain alleles, where the role of\nthe environment is reduced to permitting this potential to unfold (see\nentries on\n heritability\n and\n the distinction between innate and acquired characteristics).\n The question is if the influence of genes and environment can be\nseparated, especially when considering the often non-additive\ncharacter of genotype-environment interactions (Gray 1992; Griffiths\n2006; Kitcher 2001). These issues are most controversial and have\nreceived most attention regarding the question to what extent human\nbehaviors or cognitive capabilities can be described as genetically\ndetermined (Esposito 2017; Keller 2010; Longino 2013; Schaffner 2016;\nTabery 2014; Turkheimer 2019). Interestingly, the new science of\nmolecular epigenetics is often framed in a deterministic language as\nwell (see\n \u00a71.5;\n Meloni 2016; Richardson 2017; Waggoner & Uller 2015).\n2.3.2 The molecular and the post-genomic gene\n\nMolecular biology is not interested merely in the physical\ncharacterization of molecules; it aims to assign biological roles to\nmolecules, that is, functions in highly specialized, directively\norganized systems (Waters 2000). However, it becomes increasingly\nquestionable if molecules identified as developmental resources or\nfunctional parts of cellular mechanisms can be identified in a\ncoherent manner as genes or gene products. The classical molecular\ngene concept has been undermined by the accumulation of insights about\nthe complexities of regulation and post-transcriptional processing of\nRNA (see\n \u00a7\u00a71.4\u20131.5;\n Fogle 2000; Portin 2002). A more flexible gene concept has since\nemerged, which analysts have dubbed the \u201cpost-genomic\ngene\u201d (Griffiths & Stotz 2006). In an influential article,\nresearchers associated with the ENCODE project suggested the following\ndefinition:\n\n\nThe gene is a union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of\npotentially overlapping functional products. (Gerstein et al. 2007:\n677)\n\n\nIn this view, several molecular products are the starting point from\nwhich elements in the genome are identified giving rise to this set of\nproducts (regulatory regions not included).\n\nThe post-genomic gene thus not only adds to the plurality of gene\nconcepts, but it is also inherently pluralistic. Many new cellular\nprocesses have been discovered and found to be ubiquitous, such as\nframeshifting, antisense DNA transcription, alternative and\ntrans-splicing, RNA editing, as well as an abundance of regulatory\nelements in DNA, and of DNA regions transcribed to non-coding, but\nfunctional RNA. This has created a situation in which no single or\nsimple set of criteria can be formulated for when a sequence of DNA\ncounts as a gene. While the classical molecular gene seemed to\nreestablish a one-one relation of genes and phenotypes on the\nmolecular level (one gene \u2013 one polypeptide), the processes just\nmentioned can result in a situation where one gene identified through\nan ORF gives rise to various gene products (molecular phenotypes). One\ncan thus speak of \u201cmolecular pleiotropy\u201d (Burian 2004).\nAdditionally, a given product might be synthesized from various genes\n(ORFs). Accordingly, a given stretch of DNA can belong to several\ngenes identified more broadly as set of template resources for a\nproduct. Furthermore, the nature of these processes implies that the\nmolecular phenotype is not determined by the DNA sequence but depends\non a distributed and context-dependent interaction of many cellular\nand, ultimately, extracellular factors. Hence one can also speak of\n\u201cmolecular epigenesis\u201d in this respect (Burian 2004).\n\nAgain, however, it seems that just as the molecular gene concept has\nnot replaced the instrumental gene concept, the new, post-genomic\nconcept has not replaced the molecular gene concept. Indeed, empirical\nresearch shows that groups that identify with different subfields of\nbiology prefer different gene concepts (Stotz et al. 2004). Referring\nto genes as more or less straightforward representations of gene\nproducts in DNA sequence plays an important role in many contexts, and\nfor coordinating research and integrating results from various fields.\nGene annotation, for instance, which is necessary to make genome\nsequences in databases accessible in a useful way, depends on\nidentifying genes in a canonical manner (Baetu 2012a; see\n \u00a71.5).\n The persisting classical molecular gene concept can be referred to as\nthe \u201cconsensus\u201d or \u201cnominal gene\u201d (Burian\n2004; Fogle 2000; Griffiths & Stotz 2006). The post-genomic gene\nconcept, instead, has been proposed to capture situations where\nresearchers focus on the complexities of regulation, transcription,\nand translation, and conceptualize genes as template resources used in\nvarious ways in cellular processes (Griffiths & Stotz 2006). Even\nin cases of complex transcription, however, the identification of\ngenes tends to be guided by the consensus gene concept. As opposed to\nthe instrumental and the nominal molecular gene, the post-genomic gene\ndoes not entail a prescription as to how to identify a gene. In some\nsense, the focus shifts more to function (the product), but at the\nsame time this new concept de-emphasizes the gene as a unit and\nfacilitates the study of the whole genome as a set of complexly\nstructured DNA molecules (Barnes & Dupr\u00e9 2008; Falk\n2010).\n\nBecause of its focus on structure and the resulting usefulness for\nannotation practices in bioinformatics, the nominal gene remains the\nunit of analysis in comparative genomics (see\n \u00a71.5).\n In these contexts, claims about similarity in terms of nominal\nmolecular genes are often translated into claims of similarity more\nbroadly construed, based on the assumption that homologous genes yield\nhomologous products and hence are involved in homologous functions.\nSuch claims are, however, often not warranted given the complexity of\ngene expression (Piotrowska 2009). On the other hand, much of genomic\nresearch seems not to be committed to any specific gene concept.\nStatistical techniques of bioinformatic sequence comparison function\nas discovery tools that detect relations between genome sequences,\ntranscripts, and proteins or between sequences on any level among\nvarious species (Perini 2011). They can suggest candidate genes,\nindicate events of post-transcriptional processing, or point to\nprocesses of genome evolution (see\n \u00a7\u00a71.4\u20131.5).\n Researchers in genomics (involving sequence annotation tasks), seem\nto respond to the complexities of regulation and post-transcriptional\nprocessing by operating with an extended structural characterization\n(\u201csyntax-based\u201d, in the parlance of bioinformatics-driven\nresearch) of genes and other genome elements, rather than emphasizing\nthe ad hoc identification of genes from the perspective of\nproducts captured by the post-genomic gene concept (Baetu 2011,\n2012a). A sequence thus characterized can still give rise to a variety\nof products, but their processing depends on splicing signals and\nsimilar sequence features that can be identified on a structural\nlevel. In this view, genes appear \u201cas modular sets of\ninstructions for the genome expression machinery of the cell\u201d\n(Baetu 2011: 718).\n\nIn terms of development, the genome has been described not only as a\nresource, but also as reactive to the cellular context rather than as\ndirecting cellular processes (S. Gilbert 2003; Griffiths & Stotz\n2013: Ch. 4; Keller 2014). The genome is always embedded in a cellular\nenvironment (also virus genomes become reactive in the context of\ntheir host\u2019s cells), and cellular processes mediate between the\norganismal or extra-organismal environment and the genome. The\npost-genomic gene concept is thus open to integrate molecular\nepigenetic processes that turn environmental cues into regulatory\nsignals. Molecular epigenetics has also been discussed as a pathway of\ninheritance, alternative to DNA transmission and more responsive to\nenvironmental changes (Jablonka & Raz 2009; entry on\n inheritance systems).\n Emerging knowledge of these processes re-shapes explanations in\nheredity, development, and evolution and hence shifts the explanatory\nstatus of gene concepts (Baedke 2018; Griesemer 2011; Griffiths &\nStotz 2013, Ch. 5; Le Goff et al. 2021; Stotz & Griffiths 2016).\nFurthermore, next to the complexity of the regulation and genesis of\nmolecular products, also the interaction of products as studied in\nsystems biology displays a complexity that makes it difficult to\nascribe functional roles to genes (see entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology;\n see\n \u00a71.5).\n If genes are deleted from the genome experimentally (\u201cgene\nknock-out\u201d), this often does not have the expected effect on\ndevelopmental processes, because the encoded molecules are part of\nlarge interaction networks that can exhibit a high degree of\nrobustness and redundancy (Mitchell 2009: Ch. 4; Morange 2001: Ch. 5).\nThe stochasticity of gene expression and molecular interactions\nemerges as another aspect complicating the role of genes and gene\nproducts in cellular processes (Casali & Merlin 2020; Kupiec 2014;\nMorange 2011; Nicholson 2019).\n\nIn the light of these developments, one might say that the\npost-genomic gene was disassociated from the notion of a\n\u201cgenetic program\u201d, which was criticized as embodying a\npreformationist view of development (Keller 2000; Moss 1992; Robert\n2004; entry on \n theories of biological development). \n Some have argued,\nhowever, that the concept is still important for reasoning about\nregulatory mechanisms, highlighting roles and organizational features\nof genomic elements without excluding others (Baetu 2012b; Calcott\n2020). Nonetheless, it appears that post-genomic explanations are\nrather articulated in terms of signaling, regulatory, or interaction\nnetworks than programs (Calcott 2014; Huneman 2019; Planer 2014). Even\nthough genes do not constitute a blueprint of the organism (Pigliucci\n2010), DNA and its functional elements provide a form of stability\nnecessary for epigenetic processes to yield robust outcomes (De\nTi\u00e8ge et al. 2015; Meunier & Reynaud 2017; Vecchi\n2020).\n\nSuggestions have been made to use the term \u201cgene\u201d to refer\nto the whole process that yields the functional product (the\n\u201cprocess molecular gene\u201d concept, Neumann-Held 1999). But\napart from the fact that it is difficult to delineate the boundaries\nof such a process, this seems to be too distant from the ways\nresearchers use the term. Biologists and philosophers have suggested\nalternative terminologies for DNA sequences that are meant to replace\nor complement the problematic term gene, for instance, regarding\ngenome evolution (Brosius & Gould 1992), regulation (Scherrer\n& Jost 2007), and from an integrative systems perspective (Keller\n& Harel 2007). While some of these interventions seem to suggest\nthat the gene concept has become redundant, biologists have emphasized\nits explanatory value when seen in the right context, in particular,\nas a cellular component (Hall 2001). It might be the case that this\ncomponent of cells has received undue attention to the expense of\nothers, but it must also be noted that genes (or DNA) are often in\nfocus because they can be most easily intervened on, while these\ninterventions can then also be informative about other components of\ncellular processes (Gannett 1999; Waters 2008). Similarly, in the\npractical contexts of synthetic biology, genes can often successfully\nbe constructed, conceptually and materially, as causal agents (Oftedal\n& Parkkinen 2013). More generally, it has been suggested that the\ngene concept is useful exactly because of its overall vagueness,\nbecause it can be adjusted to specific epistemic needs within newly\nemerging fields and at the same time facilitate connections between\ndisparate areas of research (Rheinberger & M\u00fcller-Wille\n2018).\n3. Conclusion\n\nIt became clear that discussions in philosophy of biology are driven\nby developments in biology. At the same time, it appears that there is\nno end to scientific innovation in biology. New technologies open new\nwindows into biological domains, make new phenomena accessible, or\nshed a different light on known entities and processes. These\ndevelopments and the ensuing theoretical shifts and conceptual\ntransformations will require a type of conceptual reflection and\nclarification for which philosophy of science has developed an\nindispensable set of tools (Pradeu et al. forthcoming).\n",
