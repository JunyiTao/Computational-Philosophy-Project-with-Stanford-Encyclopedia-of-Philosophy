Examples that illustrate the difference between a priori and a posteriori (empirical) justification\n\nA priori justification is a certain kind of justification\noften contrasted with empirical, or a posteriori,\njustification. Roughly speaking, a priori justification\nprovides reasons for thinking a proposition is true that comes from\nmerely understanding, or thinking about, that proposition. In\ncontrast, a posteriori justification requires more than\nmerely understanding a proposition. Observations based on our senses,\nor introspection about our current mental state, are needed for us to\nbe empirically, or a posteriori, justified in believing that\nsome proposition is true. Examples below bring out the contrast. The\nfirst proposition in each group is a prime candidate for being a\npriori justified, if justified at all, while the other\npropositions are prime candidates for being a posteriori\njustified, if justified at all. Some of the propositions are false,\nbut that does not mean that we could not be justified in believing\nthem before we had evidence that they are false.\n\n1\n\n\na.\nAll bachelors are unmarried males.\nb.\n All bachelors in the U.S. are taxed at a different rate from\nmarried men.\n\n2\n\n\na.\n All vixens are female.\nb.\n All vixens are cunning.\n\n3\n\n\na.\n Green is a color.\nb.\n Grass is green.\n\n4\n\n\na.\n All Crimson things are red.\nb.\n All recent volumes of Who\u2019s Who are red.\n(Williamson 2013: 295)\n\n5\n\n\na.\n A house is an abode for living.\nb.\n A house undermined will fall.

The way the first members can be justified is called\na priori; the way the other members can be justified is\ncalled a posteriori (or empirically).\n\nThe first question to discuss is what sorts of propositions can be\na priori justified and known.\n2. What sorts of propositions can be a priori justified and known: all, and only, modal propositions?\n\nPhilosophers generally agree that we can be justified in believing\n 15bi\n and\n 15biii\n only empirically. Yet many believe that they are necessarily true. If\nthey are necessarily true, that would mean that it\u2019s false that\nwe can be justified in believing necessary truths only a\npriori. But some philosophers think that\n 15bi\n and\n 15biii\n are not necessary truths and the relevant necessary truth that we can\nknow a priori is that the essence of any type of matter is\ngiven by the basic elements of which it is composed. On this view, in\nthe case of water and rubies, we discover empirically what those basic\nelements are and the propositions that state those discoveries are\ncontingent. Philosophers who hold that\n 15bi\n and\n 15biii\n do express necessary truths usually think that there are descriptions\nthat fix the reference of the terms, for example, for water, the\ndescription, \n\n\nthe stuff, whatever it is, that, in the actual world, has the\nproperties of quenching thirst, putting out certain fires, falling\nfrom the clouds as rain, filling the lakes and rivers, etc. \n\n\nWhile the meaning of \u201cwater\u201d is given by this\nreference-fixing description, and can be known a priori, the\nessence of water must be discovered empirically. The meaning of\nnatural kind terms does not give the essence of the kind directly in\nthe way it does with \u201cbachelor\u201d and \u201cvixen\u201d.\n\n\nOne might think that\n 15a\n can be justified only empirically, but gemologists seem to think that\nit is conceptually necessary that rubies are red, that is,\nthat the meaning of \u201cruby\u201d requires that rubies be red. So\ngiven how gemologists use \u201cruby\u201d,\n 15a\n is knowable a priori. The notion of a ruby seems to be a\nhybrid notion: its color is knowable a priori but its\nmaterial essence as given in\n 15bi\n is knowable only empirically.\n\nWhile it is widely believed that some necessary truths are capable of\njustification and can be known only empirically (e.g., \u201cWater is\nH2O\u201d), some contingent truths also seem justifiable, and\nknowable, a priori. Saul Kripke proposed that \u201cthe\nstandard meter stick, S, in Paris is a meter long at\n\\(t_0\\)\u201d is such an example (Kripke 1972: 274\u2013275).\n\u201cThe length of S in the actual world at\n\\(t_0\\)\u201d rigidly designates that length, that is, it refers to\nlength L in every possible world. The reference of \u201cone\nmeter\u201d is given by that reference-fixing description, so\n\u201cone meter\u201d rigidly designates L. However,\n\u201cthe length of S at \\(t_0\\)\u201d does not rigidly\ndesignate any particular length since at \\(t_0\\) in other possible\nworlds S will be longer or shorter than L. So the\nproposition that \u201cS is a meter long at \\(t_0\\)\u201d is\ncontingent because in other possible worlds that very same stick will\nbe shorter or longer than it was in the actual world at that time.\nStill, we can know a priori, that is, independent of any\nempirical evidence, that \u201cS is a meter long at\n\\(t_0\\)\u201d is true in the actual world given that we know how the\nreference of \u201cone meter\u201d is fixed by a description that\nrefers to the length of S in the actual world. If empirical\nevidence plays any role, it is only insofar as we need it to know that\nthere really is a stick, S, that was designated as the meter at\nsome particular time and place. \n\nA second candidate for being a contingent proposition that is knowable\na priori comes from John Turri. He claims that the\nproposition, \u201cThe most unlikely possible event is not presently\noccurring\u201d, is contingent yet can be known simply in virtue of\nunderstanding its content, and hence is knowable a priori\n(2011: 337\u2013338). \u201cThe most unlikely possible event\u201d\nrefers to an event that is maximally improbable. So we know a\npriori that no one could have sufficient reason to believe that\nan event that fits that description is now occurring. Still, it is\npossible that such an event is presently occurring. Thus we can know\na priori that the contingent proposition that says that a\nmaximally improbable event is now occurring is false, and that its\ndenial is true.\n\nA third candidate for being a contingent proposition that is knowable\na priori is offered by Gareth Evans. He thinks that we can be\na priori justified in believing, and know, propositions of\nthe form, \u201cIf actually p, then p\u201d, and particular\ninstantiations of that form. Consider, \u201cif any post is actually\nred, then it is red\u201d. This proposition is contingent because the\npost could be red in the actual world but not red in some other\npossible world. So in some other possible world, \\(w_2\\), its\nantecedent can be true (because its antecedent is about the color of\nthe post in the actual world, \\(w_1\\)) and it\u2019s consequent false\n(because the post is not red in \\(w_2\\) and the consequent is\nabout the color of the post in that world). A conditional that is\nnecessarily true cannot have a true antecedent and a false consequent\nin any possible world. However, we can know independently of\nexperience (that is, a priori) that if the post is actually\nred, then it\u2019s red since it is true in the actual world (cf.,\nEvans 1979: 83\u201385, for his discussion of this topic).\n\nAnother candidate for the contingent a priori is the\nproposition expressed by, \u201cI am here now\u201d. That sentence\nexpresses a contingent proposition, since I do not have to exist, much\nless do I have to be where I actually am at the present time. Yet a\nperson can know it is true wherever and whenever she utters it\nregardless of the experiences she is currently having or has had in\nthe past, and so independently of experience.\n\nLeaving aside now the question of whether there can be contingent\npropositions that are knowable a priori, there seems to be a\ndifference within the class of necessarily true propositions that can\nbe known, or justifiably believed, a priori. The propositions\nexpressed by\n 10a\u201314a\n seem different from the propositions expressed by\n 1a\u20138a.\n Each of the latter propositions seem to be analytic, that is, in each\ncase the sentence that expresses the proposition will express a\nlogical truth if relevant terms and expressions in it are replaced by\nappropriate synonyms. So, for instance, \u201call vixens are\nfemale\u201d will express a logical truth of the form if \\(A \\amp\nB\\), then A if we substitute for \u201cvixen\u201d,\n\u201cfemale fox\u201d, for it will then say: if something is a\nfemale fox, it is a female. But no substitution of synonyms for terms\nor expressions in\n 10a\u201314a\n will yield a logical truth. The propositions expressed by\n 10a\u201314a\n are often said to be synthetic a priori propositions because\nthey are not analytic (they are not true in virtue of their meaning,\nas it is sometimes put) but are a priori knowable and\njustifiable. \n3. Is a priori justification fallible and defeasible?\n\nA type of justification (say, via perception) is fallible if and only\nif it is possible to be justified in that way in holding a false\nbelief. A type of justification is defeasible if and only if that\njustification could be overridden by further evidence that goes\nagainst the truth of the proposition or undercut by considerations\nthat call into question whether there really is justification (say,\npoor lighting conditions that call into question whether vision\nprovides evidence in those circumstances).\n\nJust as we can be empirically justified in believing a false\nproposition (e.g.,\n 9b:\n two quarts of water plus two quarts of carbon tetrachloride do not\ncombine to yield four quarts of liquid), philosophers argue that we\ncan also be a priori justified in believing a false\nproposition. Perhaps Kant was a priori justified in believing\nthat every event has a cause. He thought that the proposition had that\nstatus. Yet many physicists believe that there are genuinely random\nevents at the subatomic level, and reasonably believe it false that\nevery event has a cause. You might initially be a priori\njustified in believing that no matter how happiness has been produced\nit is intrinsically good\n (12a),\n or that it is always wrong to punish an innocent person\n (13a).\n You might later think of counterexamples to such claims (e.g., by\nconsidering happiness produced through the suffering of others or\npunishing an innocent person to prevent some evil men from punishing\nhim and many other innocent people). Then your initial a\npriori justification would be defeated. John Hawthorne notes how\neven paradigmatic instances of a priori justification, such\nas someone\u2019s carefully working through a mathematical proof, can\nbe undercut if the person gets empirical evidence that he is mad or\nthat his proof is probably mistaken (based on evidence provided by\nexpert testimony, a bad track record, or of distorting background\nconditions, etc.) (Hawthorne 2013: 2009). These examples seem to show\nthat a priori justification is fallible and defeasible (i.e.,\nit can be defeated by further a priori or empirical\nevidence).\n\nConsider another example that makes this point. A sorites paradox\ninvolving heaps consists of the general claim that if you take one\nbean away from a heap of beans, you still have a heap, and a more\nspecific claim that, say, any cone-shaped stack of a thousand beans is\na heap. These two premises will lead you, bean by bean, to the\nconclusion that one, or even no beans, is a heap! It seems that we are\na priori justified in believing both the general and the more\nspecific claim are true, but at least one of them must not be true\n(perhaps the general claim is false, or even neither true nor false)\nbecause together they lead to an absurd conclusion. So this is another\nreason to think that a priori justification is fallible. (See\nSosa 1998: 258\u2013259, for an example about heaps.) George Bealer\nargues that philosophical paradoxes show that intuition is fallible\n(1998: 202). With a paradox, you are justified in believing each of a\nset of propositions taken separately, but at least one of them must be\nfalse because the set is inconsistent.\n\nWhy have some thought that a proposition that is a priori\njustified cannot be defeated by empirical evidence? Kant said that\na priori knowledge is \u201cknowledge that is absolutely\nindependent of all experience\u201d (Kant 1787 [1965: 43(B3)]). But\nit might be that the requirement that a priori knowledge be\nabsolutely independent of all experience is\ntoo stringent. Enabling experiences may be required. It avoids this\ndifficulty to hold instead that a priori knowledge and\njustification are independent of all experience beyond what is\nneeded to grasp the relevant concepts involved in the relevant\nproposition (see, below,\n sec. 4.1).\n The fact that a priori knowledge is not independent of all\nexperience does not show that it is empirically defeasible, but it\ndoes defeat the argument that it is not empirically defeasible\nbecause it is independent of all experience.\n\nWhen it is just a matter of a priori justification, not\nknowledge, Philip Kitcher thinks that if there is such a thing as all\nthings considered a priori justification, then \u201ca\nperson is entitled to ignore empirical information about the type of\nworld she inhabits\u201d (Kitcher 1983: 30; see, also, 24,\n80\u201387). This view seems to rest on Kant\u2019s idea but applied\nto justification, not just knowledge. If a priori\njustification is independent of all empirical experience,\nthen no such experience can count either for or against a\nproposition that is justified a priori. Hilary Putnam thinks\nthat if there is a priori justification, then there are\n\u201ctruths which it is always rational to believe\u201d (Putnam\n1983: 90). On Kitcher\u2019s understanding of a priori\njustification, it is not defeasible by empirical information;\non Putnam\u2019s, it is not defeasible at all.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how either view is defensible in light of the\nobjections by Sosa, Bealer, and Hawthorne. Insofar as justification is\nrelative to the evidence a person has, or should have, it seems\npossible for further evidence, either empirical or from intuition or\nrational insight, to override or undercut a person\u2019s current\nevidence and thereby destroy that person\u2019s current justification\nand knowledge. Nothing in the nature of a priori\njustification rules out that possibility. (See the discussion of\nHartry Field, in\n Section 4.5\n below, for more on why it is possible for empirical evidence\nin particular to defeat a priori justification.)\n\nUp to this point, the discussion has focused on the sorts of\npropositions that can be justified, or known, a priori, and\nwhether a priori justification is fallible and defeasible.\nBut what does it mean to say that someone is a priori\njustified in believing propositions like those expressed by each of\nthe first sentences in the fifteen examples above, that is, by\n 1a\u201315a?\n The discussion will now focus on that question.\n\nThen I will turn to the three main views about the nature of a\npriori justification. One view is that a priori\njustification is not significantly different from empirical\njustification. A second view is that it rests on a distinct type of\ninternal mental state often called rational intuition or rational\ninsight and that those intuitions or insights can provide evidence for\nor against certain propositions. A third view is that a person can be\na priori entitled to believe certain propositions\nindependently of any evidence, or can be default reasonable in\naccepting a proposition independent of any evidence.\n4. What is the nature of a priori justification?\n4.1 A priori justification is justification that is independent of experience\n\nA standard answer to the question about the difference between a\npriori and empirical justification is that a priori\njustification is independent of experience and empirical justification\nis not, and this seems to explain the contrasts present in the fifteen\nexamples above. But various things have been meant by\n\u201cexperience\u201d. On a narrow account,\n\u201cexperience\u201d refers to sense experience, that is, to\nexperiences that come from the use of our five senses: sight, touch,\nhearing, smell, and taste. However, this narrow account implies that\njustification based on introspection, proprioception (our kinesthetic\nsense of the position and movements of our body), memory, and\ntestimony are kinds of a priori justification. And if we had\ndifferent senses, like those of bats (echolocation) and duck-billed\nplatypuses (electrolocation), experiences based on those senses would\nprovide a priori, not empirical, justification on this\naccount which takes a priori justification to be independent\nof experiences based on the senses we have.\n\nGiven these considerations, perhaps \u201cexperience\u201d should be\ntaken to mean \u201csense experience of any sort, introspection,\nproprioception, memory, and testimony\u201d. This sounds like a\nhodgepodge of various sources of justification but perhaps what unites\nthem is that, leaving aside memory and testimony, these sources\nprovide us with information either about the physical world or our\ninner world, either the outer world through perception or the inner\nworld of what we are feeling or thinking, or information about our\nbodies, through introspection and proprioception. Memory and testimony\nare not primary sources of justification; their primary epistemic\nfunction is to transmit either a priori or empirical\njustification. So the proposal should be seen as a way of\ndistinguishing the primary sources of justification into two\ncategories of justification: a priori and empirical.\n\nAs noted above (see,\n sec. 3)\n and below\n (secs. 4.4 and 4.5),\n \u201cindependent of experience\u201d should not be taken to mean\nindependent of all experience, but, as a first approximation,\nto mean \u201cindependent of all experience beyond what is needed\nto grasp the relevant concepts involved in the\nproposition\u201d. It is sometimes said that a priori\njustification can depend on experience insofar as it enables\nthe person to acquire the concepts needed to grasp the meaning of the\nproposition which is the object of justification, but experience\ncannot play an evidential role in that justification\n(Williamson 2013: 293). Later we will see that the notion of enabling\nexperience might better be expanded to include experience needed to\nacquire certain intellectual skills such as those needed to construct\ncertain proofs or create counterexamples (see,\n secs. 4.4 and 4.5,\n below).\n\nSuppose there is a significant difference between a priori\nand empirical justification. This still does not tell us what the\nbasis of a priori justification is. One view is that rational\nintuitions or insights are the bases of a priori\njustification; experiences, as construed above, the bases of empirical\njustification. Before discussing the nature of rational intuitions or\ninsights, we should first distinguish between intuitions and\nintuitive judgments and consider what the content of\nintuitive judgments evoked in thought experiments is.\n4.2 What is the content of intuitive judgments?\n\nAnna-Sara Malmgren holds that intuitions are certain kinds of\nmental states some of which are candidates as justifiers of\nintuitive judgments that are made in response to\nphilosophical thought experiments (2011: 267\u2013268). What is\nthe content of such intuitive judgments? Malmgren notes that\nthere are several different ways to characterize intuitive judgments,\nbut because they are all controversial, she characterizes them by\nreference to examples. For her, \u201can intuitive judgment is any\njudgment relevantly similar to certain paradigms or examples\u201d\n(Malmgren 2011: 268). Her paradigm examples are of judgments that are\nevoked in Gettier cases where a person is in some sense lucky to have\na true belief given his evidence, Twin Earth cases where a term or\nphrase does not refer to the same thing in different possible worlds,\nand the trolley case where a heavy man is pushed in front of a trolley\nto stop it from running over five people further down the tracks.\nOthers offer as examples the judgment that it is morally permissible\nto unhook a violinist who has been connected to your kidneys without\nyour consent, even if that will kill him (an example made famous by\nJudith Thomson in the abortion debate), the judgment that it is\nirrational for a man who grants that his life in the future will be\nhappy, not a burden on others, virtuous, productive, with many friends\nand adventures, and will otherwise be worthwhile, to refuse to take a\nlife-saving pill (Derek Parfit\u2019s Early Death 2011:\n270-71), and the judgment that it is irrational for a person now not\nto care about his suffering on any future Tuesday just because\nit\u2019s a Tuesday (Parfit\u2019s Future Tuesday\nIndifference 1984: 124).\n\nMalmgren argues against Timothy Williamson\u2019s view that the\ncontent of intuitive judgments involves counterfactual judgments.\nWilliamson says that in typical Gettier cases we make two judgments: a\njudgment that such a case is possible and a counterfactual judgment\nthat if the case had occurred, it would be a case of a justified true\nbelief without knowledge. These two judgments entail that it is\npossible for a person to have a justified true belief without\nknowledge in a situation like that described in the Gettier example\n(Williamson 2004: 110). While Malmgren agrees that a possibility\njudgment is the content of the intuitive judgments in Gettier cases\n(2011: 281), she denies that it need be reached via the counterfactual\njudgment that Williamson proposes.\n\nMalmgren thinks that descriptions of cases in thought experiments are\nincomplete, and that certain ways of completing them are deviant\nbecause they involve interpretations of the cases that misunderstand\nwhat is intended (2011: 274\u2013275). In the famous Nogot/Havit\nGettier case, the issue is whether Smith knows that someone in his\noffice owns a Ford. Smith sees Nogot driving around in a Ford and,\nsay, believes that Nogot has shown him current ownership papers to a\nFord. But Nogot actually drives a rental car, does not own a Ford, and\nhas shown Smith ownership papers to a Ford he used to own. It would be\na deviant understanding of the example to assume also that Smith has\ngood independent evidence that Havit, who also works in his office,\nowns a Ford. Of course, in that case Smith would know that someone in\nhis office owns a Ford. Malmgren thinks that the interpretation that\nassumes that Smith is hallucinating and has a poor memory of what\npapers he has seen is also deviant. In that case, Smith would not be\njustified in believing that Nogot, and so someone in his office, owns\na Ford.\n\nThe intuitive judgment in the case is: it is possible that a person in\na situation like that described in the example has a justified true\nbelief without knowledge. Williamson thinks that this judgment is\nbased on the counterfactual: if the case had occurred, it would be a\ncase of justified true belief without knowledge. But in the deviant\ncases, it would not be a case of justified true belief without\nknowledge, either because it would be a case of knowledge (the extra\nreasons case where Smith has evidence that Havit owns a Ford) or not a\ncase of justified belief (where Smith is hallucinating, has a poor\nmemory, etc.). However, those deviant cases could occur in the\npossible world that is most similar to the actual world, sometimes\ncalled the \u201cnearest possible world\u201d by philosophers.\nBecause of this, as counterfactuals are usually understood by\nphilosophers, what Williamson takes to be the relevant counterfactual\nwould be false. In the nearest possible world where the standard\ndescription of the case holds, the consequent of the counterfactual\nwould be false. So the case would offer no support for the intuitive\nmodal judgment: it is possible that a person has a justified true\nbelief without knowledge. It seems clear to Malmgren that the case\ndoes support that possibility judgment regardless of whether nearby\nworlds are deviant (making the consequent of the relevant\ncounterfactual false) or not (Malmgren 2011: 278\u2013279). So\nWilliamson must be mistaken in thinking that some counterfactual\njudgment must be the basis of the modal intuitive judgment: it is\npossible to have a justified true belief without knowledge in a case\nlike the one described in the example.\n4.3 There is no significant difference between a priori and a posteriori justification and knowledge\n\nOne way to answer the question about the nature of a priori\njustification and knowledge is to adopt a bottom up approach. Start\nwith contrasting examples like the fifteen above and construct a\ntheory that explains the difference. Timothy Williamson objects to\nthis approach on the grounds that it may result \u201cin a\ndistinction of no special significance like a taxonomy of plants and\nanimals based on color\u201d or the classification of plants into\nbushes and non-bushes (2013: 291 and 309). Ultimately, that is what he\nargues: the difference between a priori and a\nposteriori knowledge is insignificant.\n\nWilliamson imagines that through perceptual experiences and relevant\nfeedback a person has acquired the ability to reliably judge distances\nin terms of inches, and separately, by the same means, to judge them\nin terms of centimeters. But she has not yet realized that there is a\nrelationship between distance in inches and distance in centimeters.\nThen one day she uses her perceptual capacity to judge distances in\ninches and centimeters \u201coffline\u201d by forming side-by-side\nvisual images of marks nine inches apart and nineteen centimeters\napart and sees that D is true: If two marks had been nine\ninches apart, they would have been at least nineteen centimeters\napart. She has never measured how far apart the front and back\nlegs of an ant are, but in a similar way she uses her imagination and\nsees that A is true: If two marks had been nine inches\napart, they would have been further apart than the front and back legs\nof an ant.\n\nIn both cases, experience is the basis of a capacity to make judgments\nin imagination and what goes on in imagination is what provides the\njustification for those judgments.\n\nWilliamson\u2019s argument against the significance of the\ndistinction between a priori and a posteriori\njustification rests on comparing how D and A (and other\nsimilar pairs of propositions like 4a and 4b in the examples above)\nare justified. He contends that they are both justified by relevant\nmanipulations in imagination. But on traditional accounts of\njustification, D would be a paradigm case of some proposition\nthat can only be a priori justified and A a paradigm\ncase of some proposition that can only be a posteriori\njustified. Williamson seems happy to concede that there is some sort\nof difference (2013: 294\u2013295, 296\u2013297) between these two\ntypes of justification but to deny that it is a significant difference\ngiven the way that each type relies on manipulations in imagination.\nHe might grant that the difference is like the difference between\nseeing something through a microscope or telescope as opposed to\nseeing something with the naked eye. There is a difference, but it is\nnot a significant difference since these three types of seeing all\nrely on visual perceptions.\n\nDefenders of a significant distinction between a priori and\na posteriori justification could grant that there is no\nsignificant difference insofar as imagination plays the role in\njustification that Williamson proposes. And sometimes it does play\nthat role in a priori justification as Elijah Chudnoff\nillustrates with many examples involving geometric propositions and\naccompanying figures (2011a: 636\u201338; 2013a: 370\u2013372).\nHowever, there are other ways to justify propositions a\npriori. Some seemingly a priori propositions\ncan be justified by reflection. One example that Chudnoff often\nappeals to involves the proposition: if \\(a\\lt 1\\), then \\(2 -2a \\gt\n0\\). To justify that proposition, you might first let \\(a = 1\\) and\nsee that \\(2 - 2a = 0\\). You might then reflect that when\n\u201ca\u201d is a number less than one but greater than or\nequal to zero, \\((2 - 2a)\\) is greater than zero. Finally, you might\nreflect that if \u201ca\u201d is a negative number, \\((-2a)\\)\nwill be a positive number, so \\((2 - 2a)\\) will be a number larger\nthan 2, and so greater than zero. So by reflection on a few relevant\ncases, we can come to see a priori that if \\(a\\lt 1\\), then\n\\((2 - 2a) \\gt 0\\). This way is much different than the way we might\ncome via imagination to see A = If two marks had been nine\ninches apart, they would have been further apart than the front and\nback legs of an ant.\n\nIn the case of proposition D, we might learn that one inch\nequals 2.54 centimeters, do the math and see that nine inches equals\n22.86 centimeters, and thereby see that nine inches is greater than\nnineteen centimeters. There are other ways to be a priori\njustified in believing some proposition is true than by what\nWilliamson calls the method of simulation. And those ways of\njustifying a proposition a priori are significantly different\nfrom a posteriori ways of justifying a proposition.\n\nIn a forthcoming essay in a book in which Williamson and Paul\nBoghossian debate the a priori (forthcomingb), Boghossian\ndefends three different ways (none of which involve the method of\nsimulation) by which we might be a priori justified in\nbelieving a proposition: two ways in which our understanding might be\nthe source of a priori justification, and a third way that\nappeals to rational intuitions that do not have a distinctive\nphenomenology and, according to Boghossian, are not the product of our\nunderstanding concepts.\n\nIn many essays and a book, Elijah Chudnoff argues that intuitions have\nwhat he calls a \u201cpresentational phenomenology\u201d that\nparallels that of perception. For him, intuitions are intellectual\nperceptions that sometimes reveal abstract reality in the way that\nsensory perceptions sometimes reveal concrete reality. So on his view,\na priori justification is similar to, but significantly\ndifferent from, a posteriori justification. For Chudnoff,\nintuitions can be evoked through imagination, reflection, and even\nreasoning from premises to a conclusion, but it is their nature, not\ntheir source, that is the basis of their ability to provide\njustification. His argument parallels an argument that says\nperceptions justify because they are the mental states they are, not\nbecause of their source. That is why they can provide justification in\na demon world or the Matrix, even though their source is a demon or\nsuper computers and not real objects.\n\nLike Boghossian and Chudnoff, and unlike Williamson, Albert Casullo\nthinks that there is a significant difference between a\npriori and a posteriori justification based on the\ndifference between support by nonexperiential and\nexperiential evidence. He also thinks that there is something\nlike justification (namely, positive epistemic status) that does not\nrest on evidence at all (2012c: 318\u2013326). For Casullo and\nothers, positive epistemic status can stem from what you are entitled\nto accept given certain ends or projects. This sort of view will be\ndiscussed in\n Section 4.5\n below.\n4.4 Rational intuitions or insights as the bases of a priori justification\n\nSuppose a priori justification rests on output (evidence)\nfrom some nonexperiential source. What sort of evidence could\nthat be? A standard answer is that intuition, or rational insight, is\nthe basis of a priori justification. And what are intuitions,\nor rational insights?\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, Malmgren distinguishes between intuitions and\nintuitive judgments, where an intuition is a distinctive type of\nmental state that can justify a judgment (2011: 267\u2013268). But\nnot everyone means the same thing by \u201cintuition\u201d. In\nThinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman argues that\nintuitions often lead us to accept false beliefs. He offers Herbert\nSimon\u2019s definition of an intuition, \u201cIntuition is nothing\nmore and nothing less than recognition [of some cue stored in\nmemory]\u201d (2011: 11, 237). But Kahneman is thinking of fast,\nautomatic, immediate judgments when he writes of intuitions and\nintuitive judgments based on them. He often thinks of them as issuing\nfrom \u201cgut feelings\u201d, as in his example of \u201cthe chief\ninvestment officer of a large financial firm\u201d who decided to\ninvest tens of millions of dollars in Ford Stock after recently\nattending an auto show where Ford vehicles were on display (2011: 12).\nAnd he describes an intuitive answer as \u201cthe first one that\ncomes to mind\u201d (2011: 6). Elijah Chudnoff has a different\nconception of intuitions because he thinks that \u201cthere are\nhard-won intuitions which take deliberate effort to have\u201d and\nother intuitions that require an expert to guide a person before she\ncan have them (Chudnoff forthcoming).\n\nPhilosophers do not mean what Kahneman means when they refer to the\nintuitions people typically have when considering Gettier cases and\nthe other paradigmatic cases listed above. While intuitions are\nnon-inferential, some can appear only after much reflection and effort\n(see, again, Chudnoff forthcoming). Nor are they what George Bealer\nmeans by a \u201cphysical intuition\u201d, such as the one that\nfounds the intuitive judgment that a house undermined will fall\n(Bealer 1992: 102; 1998: 207, 211). They are some sort of intellectual\nseeming (Bealer) or rational insight (BonJour). For Bealer and\nBonJour, taken in the broadest sense, intuitions are non-inferential\nin that they are not the conclusion of some piece of reasoning. For\nChudnoff, intuitions can be produced by reasoning though their\njustificatory force does not come from that reasoning. The reasoning\njust leads you to a proposition that seems true in itself. Like\nsensations, intuitions must be occurrent, and so are unlike beliefs,\nwhich need not be. You can have a belief that P while not\nconsidering P, but you cannot have an intuition that P\nwhile not considering P. \n\nWhen it is a matter of perception, in the Mueller-Lyer figure the line\nwith the arrowheads pointing inward appears longer than the\none with them pointing outward even if you know it is not really\nlonger. To some people at least, in the Monty Hall example it\nseems that there is a 50-50 chance that the grand prize is\nbehind either of the two doors that are left unopened after Monty has\nopened one of them, even though they know that the probability it is\nbehind the door the contestant did not choose is 2/3 (see Russell\n2010: 464, for the Monty Hall example). So intuitions are a type of\nappearing; physical and philosophical intuitions have this in common.\nGeorge Bealer characterizes a rational intuition as an\nintellectual seeming that some proposition is\nnecessarily, or possibly, true (Bealer 1998:\n207\u2013208). He contrasts this with the physical intuition that a\nhouse undermined will fall which is not about what is necessarily or\npossibly true. Also, philosophical intuitions are based solely on\nunderstanding the proposition which is their object while physical\nintuitions are based on understanding something about the physical\nworld. Bealer contrasts intuitions with \u201cjudgments, guesses, and\nhunches\u201d (1998: 210\u2013211), common sense, belief, and even\nan inclination to believe (1998: 208\u2013209). And, of course, they\nare not just \u201cgut feelings\u201d, which are not based solely on\nunderstanding some proposition,\n\nLaurence BonJour thinks that a rational insight is an immediate,\nnon-inferential grasp, apprehension, or \u201cseeing\u201d that some\nproposition is necessarily true (BonJour 1998: 106). He goes on to\nargue that a proposition\u2019s appearing to be necessarily\ntrue is the foundation of a priori justification, because he\nwants to allow that such justification can be fallible and defeasible.\nSo for BonJour it is apparent rational insights that are the\nevidence on which a priori justification rests, not rational\ninsights themselves (1998: 112\u2013113, 1998: \u00a7\u00a74.5, 4.6).\nAfter publishing In Defense of Pure Reason (1998), and in\nresponse to comments by Paul Boghossian (2001), BonJour wrote that\nthese appearances are not propositional, that is, they are not\nappearances that something is the case (BonJour 2001a:\n677\u2013678). In this respect, they are unlike beliefs and more like\nperceptual sensations.\n\nJohn Hawthorne questions whether apparent rational insights or\nrational intuitions as understood by BonJour and Bealer, respectively,\nprovide evidence for the beliefs which are based on them. He assumes\nthat these intellectual seemings manifest themselves to inner\nconsciousness \u201cby a special kind of phenomenology\u201d\n(Hawthorne 2013: 215). He then wonders whether any of the following\nwould provide evidence: a seeming without the relevant phenomenology\nhe calls Glow, a seeming with a Glow of which the person is unaware\n(if this is even possible), a seeming with a known Glow which is\nunreliable. He seems to think that good answers to these questions\nwould require abandoning the \u201cinternalist mandate\u201d that\ndrives these views that \u201callow only that which is\n\u2018accessible\u2019 from the inside to count as relevant to\njustification\u201d (Hawthorne 2013: 216). As we\u2019ve seen,\nChudnoff thinks that intuitions have a distinctive phenomenology that\nprovides reason to believe that the propositions which are their\nobjects are true (2011b, esp. secs. 6 & 7); others think that they\nneed not have a distinctive phenomenology (Sosa 2013; Boghossian\nforthcomingb). One might maintain that at least in certain\ncircumstance, being in the mental state with the relevant\nphenomenology necessarily gives you prima facie reason to\nbelieve the proposition consideration of which caused that intuition,\nthat is, gives you a reason to believe that proposition even though\nthat reason might be undermined or overridden by further\nconsiderations.\n\nFurther, Bealer may have an answer for those who think that\nreliability is a necessary condition of justification because he\nargues that intellectual seemings are necessarily reliable when had in\ncertain conditions. He calls his view modal reliabilism (1998:\n215\u2013217), which holds that a certain kind of concept possession\n(namely, full understanding of the concept) in ideal conditions\nguarantees the sort of reliability that some think evidence requires.\nOn this view, it does not matter what, if any, phenomenology is\nassociated with the relevant intellectual seemings (cf. Sosa 2013).\nWhat matters is whether the person fully understands the relevant\nconcepts involved. That could even be the basis for justification of\nintuitive mathematical judgments that are not\naccompanied by any intuitions with Glow (a possibility\nmentioned by Hawthorne above (2013: 217)). So a defender of views like\nBonjour\u2019s and Bealer\u2019s can answer Hawthorne\u2019s\nquestions by arguing that the relevant intuitions or insights are\nreliable whether they are accompanied by Glows, unknown Glows, or no\nGlows at all.\n\nThose who hold that intuitions can justify because they are based on\nthe understanding think, for instance, that our understanding the\nconcept knowledge is the source of our intuition that a correct lucky\nguess is not knowledge. Hawthorne\u2019s criticisms of basing a\npriori justification on the understanding (as Boghossian\nforthcomingb proposes) is that there seem to be instances of a\npriori justification that require skill in \u201csophisticated\nproof techniques that are quite obviously not preconditions of\nanything in the domain\u201d (Hawthorne 2013: 213). For instance,\nsophisticated proof techniques were required to prove Fermat\u2019s\nLast Theorem even though it is easy to understand what the theorem\nsays, namely, that the equation \\(x^n + y^n = z^n\\) has no solutions\nwhen n is a positive integer greater than two. A possible\nresponse to this objection is to expand the notion of enabling\nexperiences to include those needed to acquire intellectual\nskills which are needed to employ intellectual seemings in reasoning\n(see, secs.\n 4.1\n above and\n 4.5\n below) and are different from perceptual skills. But possessing those\ntechniques without also understanding the connections between the\npremises would not yield justification. It is possible to hold that\nthe important difference between a priori and a\nposteriori justification is that once the concepts and the\nrelevant techniques are acquired, nothing more is needed for\na priori justification (that is the sense in which a\npriori justification is independent of experience), but further\nexperience is needed for a posteriori justification. Further,\nHawthorne\u2019s criticism seems not to affect whether intellectual\nintuitions that are evoked by thought experiments (as in standard\nGettier cases) can provide evidence since no special techniques are\nrequired there.\n\nWhile Hawthorne questions whether intuitions provide any evidence for\nor against philosophical theories, Brian Weatherson grants that they\ndo but questions how much evidential weight they have. Gettier\nexamples are taken by many to be a conclusive refutation of the view\nthat having a justified true belief is sufficient for knowledge, but\nnot by Weatherson. He says, \n\n\nIn short, the true theory of knowledge is the one that does best at\n(a) accounting for as many as possible of our intuitions about\nknowledge while (b) remaining systematic. (2003: 7) \n\n\nHe thinks that it may be best to accept the JTB theory of knowledge\neven in the face of Gettier examples if no other systematic theory of\nknowledge is available. Systematic theories should not have too many\nunacceptable (that is, counterintuitive) theoretical consequences,\nshould involve the analysis of a theoretically significant concept in\ntheoretically significant terms, and should be simple (2003:\n8\u20139). Weatherson says that, \n\n\nWhile a theory can be reformist, it can\u2019t be revolutionary. A\ntheory that disagreed with virtually all intuitions about possible\ncases is, for that reason, false.\n\n\nStopped Clock is a case in which a person correctly believes\nthat the time is, say, 1:00 p.m. on the basis of looking at a clock\nthat reads 1:00 o\u2019clock, and which he is justified in thinking\nis working properly. However, the clock stopped working exactly\ntwenty-four hours earlier. Still, that person has a justified true\nbelief that it is 1:00 p.m. Sheep is a case where a jokester\nfarmer breeds poodles to look like sheep, and grooms them so they are\nindistinguishable from real sheep. He puts them in his field for\ntourists to see, and his real sheep are in that field but out of sight\nbehind some large boulders where he feeds them. Jones drives by and\nforms the justified true belief that there are sheep in the field. It\nseems that the intuitions that knowledge is absent, but JTB present,\nin Stopped Clock and Sheep are enough to make it\nreasonable to reject the JTB theory of knowledge. A few really strong\nintuitions seem enough by themselves to make it reasonable to reject a\ntheory. Contra Weatherson, reasonable rejection does not require that\nthe theory disagree with virtually all intuitions.\nTheoretical virtues are not enough to overcome such intuitive\nshortcomings even if there is not a competing virtuous theoretical\nanalysis available. \n\nA promising account of a priori justification in terms of a\nnonexperiential source of evidence is one that sees\nintellectual intuition, rational insight, or apparent\nrational insight, as providing the relevant a priori evidence\nwith its source being reason. This rational capacity is not some\nspecial faculty of intuition analogous, say, to sight, which is a\nsource of empirical evidence. One function of reason involves\n\u201cseeing\u201d how evidence supports a conclusion, and\nin deductive reasoning, \u201cseeing\u201d how conclusions\nfollow from premises. This same ability is exercised when\nreason \u201csees\u201d that some proposition is true, or\nnecessarily true, simply in virtue of the person\u2019s understanding\nthe proposition. However, this intellectual \u201cseeing\u201d need\nnot have distinctive conscious qualities, qualia, associated with it,\nunlike perceptual seeing, which does. Apparent rational\ninsights need not be accompanied by appearances, if\n\u201cappearances\u201d necessarily involve qualia. The metaphor of\n\u201cseeing\u201d logical connections or that certain propositions\nare true should not mislead us into thinking that there is a special,\nquasi-perceptual faculty along with sight, touch, hearing, etc. It is\nplausible to hold that reason can \u201cgrasp\u201d and\n\u201csee\u201d without there being any analogue to having certain\ntouch or visual sensations. (In several essays, Chudnoff disagrees:\n2011a, 2011b.)\n4.5 A priori justification does not require any nonexperiential source of evidence\n\nRecently some philosophers have thought that a person can be justified\nin believing, or accepting, a proposition without having any evidence\nto support it, and so even if there is no nonexperiential\nsource of evidence for that belief or acceptance. As we have\nseen, Timothy Williamson has argued that certain acquired\nskills can be used to provide justification for believing a\nproposition for which the person does not have evidence, namely, the\nskill of bringing ideas together in imagination. His proposal is that\nin the case of the inches/centimeters proposition it is this\nskill at making comparisons of length in imagination, and\nthen observing the results, not a person\u2019s perceptual evidence,\nthat justifies him in believing that proposition.\n\nEven if true, it seems that we can distinguish empirically based from\nunderstanding based employment of a skill. Manipulating in imagination\ntwo circles of unequal radii can bring a person to understand that\nthey cannot intersect in more than two points. Creating an\nimage of a line nine inches long next to an image of a typical ant can\nbring a person to believe that the distance between the front and back\nlegs of a typical ant is less than nine inches, but not that it\nmust be. Science fiction films sometimes depict giant ants that\ncould have been actual. Further, skills at judging, say, that\nin Sheep you do not know that there are sheep in the field is\nbased on your understanding the concept \u201cknowledge\u201d. But\nyour skill in judging that sheep have wool requires more to qualify as\nknowledge than understanding that proposition: you need to know what\nsheep in fact are like. A detective\u2019s skill at deducing via\ndisjunctive syllogism that Jones is the murderer is similar to a\ngeometer\u2019s deducing that a quadrilateral has four interior\nangles or that the Pythagorean Theorem is true, but the nature of the\npremises can make all the difference between whether the reasoning is\na posteriori or a priori. So even if the exercise of\nrelevant skills can provide justification apart from evidence, how the\nskill is used, and in particular on what subject matter, seems to be a\nbasis for distinguishing a priori from a posteriori\n(empirical) justification.\n\nAnother view that rejects the idea that a justified belief must be\nfounded on evidence says that all of our beliefs are\nprima facie justified so all of them are what one might call\n\u201cdefault reasonable\u201d, that is, justified barring reasons\nto reject them (this is what Gilbert Harman (2001) calls\n\u201cgeneral foundationalism\u201d). On some accounts of a\npriori justification, namely those that hold that a\npriori justification is justification independent of\nempirical evidence, general foundationalism would imply that all\nof a person\u2019s beliefs are prima facie (or weakly) a\npriori justified since that justification would stem merely from\nthe fact that the person believes them, not from any empirical\nevidence that supports them. On this view, and contrary to\ninitial appearances, there is really no difference in the way the\npropositions at the start of this essay are prima facie\njustified since they are all weakly a priori justified if you\naccept them. The general foundationalist view might add that, if some\nare all things considered less justified than others, it is\nbecause of the relationships between them. Coherence considerations\naccount for all things considered justification and are what upset\ninitially equal prima facie justification. Further, this view\nhas the implication that you could be prima facie justified\nin believing extremely bizarre propositions, say, beliefs about what\nhappens on the planet Gliese 581d, a planet scientists have\njudged may be \u201cfriendly to life\u201d (Russell 2012: 100), even\nthough you have no empirical or testimonial evidence to support your\nbeliefs about this alien planet. You may, but need not, also believe\nthat the Gliesians are in touch with you (but not others) via\ntelepathy because you are \u201cthe chosen one\u201d. Insofar as you\nhave no defeating evidence, you could even be all things\nconsidered justified in believing all those things about the\nGlieseans, despite having no evidence to support your beliefs. But it\nseems that a coherent set of beliefs about Gliese 581d would not\nprovide a priori justification of all of them even if it\nprovided some sort of justification for them. That would be drawing\nthe boundaries of the a priori too broadly.\n\nHartry Field also holds that belief in certain propositions can be\n\u201cdefault reasonable\u201d, that is, justified but not on the\nbasis of evidence. He seems to think that if a belief\u2019s being\n\u201cdefault reasonable\u201d were sufficient for its being a\npriori justified, too many beliefs would count as being a\npriori justified. That\u2019s because he thinks, for example,\nthat \u201cPeople usually tell the truth\u201d is default reasonable\nbut not a priori justified. So he adds the requirement that\nan a priori justified belief cannot be empirically\ndefeasible (Field 2000: 119\u2013120; cited in Casullo 2012c:\n318\u2013320). But we have seen above that paradigm cases of a\npriori justification can be defeated by empirical considerations\n(see above,\n sec. 3).\n So by adding the requirement of no empirical defeat, Field\u2019s\nview will imply that there are no a priori justifiable\npropositions. On the other hand, if he drops that requirement, he\nfaces the same problem as Harman in drawing the boundaries of a\npriori justification too broadly.\n\nA final view of a priori justification according to which it\ndoes not rest on nonexperiential evidence holds that we are\nentitled to accept certain propositions on no evidence and\nthat entitlement on no grounds or evidence is what a priori\njustification amounts to. To be entitled to accept, or trust, some\npresupposition is for it to be rational to accept or trust\nit, though this is supposed to be different from being justified in\nbelieving it. Crispin Wright proposes that the laws of logic\nand the presupposition that we are not now in the midst of a coherent\nand continuing dream, not now brains-in-a vat, etc., are rational\npresuppositions, some of which are standard presuppositions of\nscience. That\u2019s because certain \u201ccognitive projects\u201d\n(i) could not be pursued without presupposing those things, (ii) there\nis no evidence to think that those presuppositions are false (even if\nalso none to think them true), and (iii) nothing will be lost, and\nsomething may be gained, by accepting these presuppositions (see\nJenkins 2007). The gains and losses must not be pragmatic gains and\nlosses such as gains and losses in happiness, prestige,\naccomplishments, wealth and the like. Otherwise all that would follow\nis that it is practically rational to accept the\npresuppositions. The gains and losses must be epistemic, that is,\nhaving to do with truth, or probable truth, or with evidence because\nWright wants the rational acceptance of such presuppositions to be an\nanswer to the skeptic about knowledge and epistemic justification.\n\nCarrie Jenkins has questioned whether the project-relative rationality\nof a presupposition that Wright proposes is enough to make it rational\nto accept that presupposition (Jenkins 2007). For instance, when\nconducting certain inquiries, it might be rational relative to\nsome project or kind of inquiry to accept that the world is a\npretty orderly place, yet not epistemically rational to accept the\npresupposition itself. Maybe we should suspend judgment about that\nuntil we go look at the world.\n\nWe might think of these presuppositions as heuristics, rules that if\nfollowed usually aid us in the pursuit of truth but in certain\ncontexts can be rationally doubted. Perhaps they do not necessarily\ndetermine what it is rational to believe or accept. In moral\nphilosophy, anti-utilitarians often claim that there are many moral\nrules that prohibit lying, cheating, stealing, torturing, etc, and\nthat these rules sometimes require people not to maximize utility. Act\nutilitarians often respond by saying that these are useful guides to\ndoing what has the best consequences, but they are not definitive of\nwhat makes actions right or wrong. Wright\u2019s presuppositions seem\nto be analogous to what act utilitarians see as heuristics or\nsecondary rules.\n\nIn summary, it seems that accounts of a priori justification\nthat do not hold that it rests on evidence provided by a\nnonexperiential source are in danger of counting certain beliefs or\nacceptances as a priori justified that, intuitively, do not\nseem to be. They are in danger of drawing the circle of a\npriori justification too broadly (Harman), to include\npropositions that are \u201cdefault reasonable\u201d (Field), or are\npresuppositions of science (Wright) that may be justified but do not\nseem to be a priori justified. The attempt by Field to narrow\nthat circle seems to rest on a doubtful assumption, namely, that a\npriori justification cannot be defeated by empirical\nevidence.\n\nIf one thinks that some sort of justification can derive from what is\ndefault reasonable or through relevant entitlements, one might adopt\nCasullo\u2019s view that there are different types of knowledge or\njustification, broadly construed: a priori which rests on\nnonexperiential evidence; a posteriori which rests on\nempirical evidence; and a third type of justification that does not\nrest on any evidence (Casullo 2012c: 324\u2013326). This section has\nraised some problems for this third conception of justification.\n\nWe turn next to considerations that seem to count for the view that\nintellectual intuitions are evidence for the propositions that are\ntheir objects.\n5. Should we think that rational intuitions provide evidence for the propositions that are their objects?\n\nThe answer to this question requires first answering another question:\nwhat are intuitions? As noted above, Bealer distinguishes between\nphysical intuitions, such as the intuition that a house undermined\nwill fall (1998: 207, 211, 213; 1992: 102, 104), and rational\nintuitions. Here are several of Bealer\u2019s examples of rational\nintuitions from (1998): if P, then not not P (207); if\nP or Q, then it is not the case that both not P\nand not Q (210); that Gettier situations are possible (207:\n211\u201312); that phenomenal colors are incompatible (211); that if\nspatial region x is a part of spatial region y and\nspatial region y is part of spatial region z, then\nspatial region x is part of spatial region z (212). At\none point Bealer says that the difference between a physical and a\nrational intuition is that a rational intuition \u201cpresents itself\nas necessary\u201d, but he immediately goes on to say that he does\nnot know exactly how to analyze this notion. A proposal he offers is\nthe following: if x (rationally) intuits P, then it\nseems to x that P and also that necessarily P.\nBut later he says that in Gettier cases there are rational intuitions\nabout the situation described being possible (1998: 206, 207,\n211\u201312), and he explicitly says, \u201cWithout possibility\nintuitions, philosophy would be fatally flawed\u201d (1998: 212;\nmy italics). It seems that what Bealer holds is that a rational\nintuition that P is one where it either seems that P and\nalso necessarily that P, OR it seems that it is possible that\nP. As we have seen, Malmgren argued that in Gettier cases the\nrelevant intuition is that it is possible that a person in\nthe relevant circumstances have a justified true belief but lack\nknowledge. Bealer\u2019s remark about an intuition\u2019s presenting\nitself as necessary was only meant as a way of contrasting the\nphysical intuition that a house undermined will fall with some other\nrational intuitions. For Bealer, rational intuitions involve modal\nseemings, either about what is necessary or possible.\n\nBealer offers a complicated multi-stage argument for why intuitions,\nso understood, provide evidence. Part of his argument involves\ndistinguishing basic from derivative sources of evidence. Some\ncontingent sources of evidence provide justification but only because\nsome basic source justifies their use. Perhaps perception is a basic\nsource of evidence and testimony derivative. But what makes a source\nof evidence basic? For Bealer, a source of evidence is basic if and\nonly if its deliverances have an appropriate kind of modal\ntie to the truth (1998: 218). His view is that a source has the\nappropriate modal tie if and only if, necessarily, its deliverances\nwould be true for the most part, that is, would be reliable, when that\nsource is employed by someone in cognitive conditions of suitable high\nquality (for short, in ideal conditions) (1998: 219). In short, the\nappropriate modal tie to the truth is the source\u2019s being\nnecessarily reliable when the person using it is in ideal cognitive\ncircumstances. This account of a basic source of evidence explains why\nguessing is not a basic source of evidence for a person who happens to\nbe a reliable guesser: guessing in that special world would be\nreliable but not in all other possible worlds. But is rational\nintuition a basic source of evidence on this account?\n\nBealer argues that rational intuitions depend on concept possession\nand if one fully understands a concept, they will be necessarily\nreliable in ideal cognitive conditions in applying that concept. A\nperson can misunderstand a concept such as arthritis and apply it to\npains in the thigh, or incompletely understand it by not knowing\nwhether it applies to a certain case or not. For example, someone\nmight not understand the concept of a contract well enough to know\nwhether it applies to any oral agreements (1998: 221). But full\nunderstanding of concepts is incompatible with any misunderstanding or\nincomplete understanding.\n\nBealer says, \u201cOur intuitions are what seem to be so concerning\nthe applicability of concepts to cases presented to pure\nthought\u201d (1998: 231). And what seems to be so is modal,\nsomething\u2019s being possible or necessary. For instance, if a\nperson who fully understands the concept knowledge is presented a\nGettier case, the relevant intuition for Bealer will be that it seems\npossible for the person in the Gettier scenario to have a\njustified true belief but lack knowledge. If a person who fully\nunderstands \u201cspatial part\u201d is asked whether it\u2019s\ntrue that if x is a part of y, and y a part of\nz, then x is a part of z, the relevant intuition\nfor Bealer will be that it seems necessarily true.\n\nBealer further maintains that we are not now in the relevant ideal\nconditions. However, he does say that, \n\n\nif we limit ourselves to suitably elementary propositions, then\nrelative to them we approximate ideal cognitive conditions,\n\n\n\nand that \n\n\nthe deliverances of our basic sources would provide in an approximate\nway the kind of pathway to the truth they would have generally in\nideal conditions. (1998: 219) \n\n\nHe is saying that even in our current non-ideal cognitive condition\nthe deliverances of our basic sources, which include rational\nintuitions, can be somewhat reliable even if not as reliable as they\nwould be in ideal conditions. He also thinks that for many of us the\nclass of elementary propositions \u201cwould not be\ninconsiderable\u201d (1998: 219). Bealer is probably thinking of the\nmany readily accessible conceptual connections such as those in\n 1a\u201315a\n given near the beginning of this entry.\n\nCasullo recommends a different approach to defending rationalism. He\nthinks rationalists should start from common ground and that they\nshould \u201cenlist empirical support for the existence of a priori\nknowledge\u201d (2012a: 248\u2013249). This may be because he thinks\nthat nonexperiential mental states are the basis of a priori\njustification and \u201cnonexperiential mental state\u201d is a\nnatural kind term. This seems plausible because Casullo thinks that\n\u201cexperience\u201d is a natural kind term (see, below,\n sec. 6.4).\n He may think that the reference of all natural kind terms must be\ndiscovered empirically and so think that what he takes as the basis of\na priori justification must be discovered empirically.\nSuppose the nonexperiential mental states that Casullo thinks are the\nbases of a priori justification are what other philosophers\ncall \u201cintuitions\u201d. If a priori knowledge rests\npartly on a priori justification, and that rests on\n\u201cintuitions\u201d, that could explain why Casullo recommends\nempirical inquiry as a means to discover what intuitions are like as a\nfirst step in explaining how they can provide a priori\njustification.\n\nBealer seems to disagree with Casullo about the nature of intuitions.\nHe has written that empirical investigation into people\u2019s\n\u201cintuitions\u201d is irrelevant because they do not investigate\nintuitions in the relevant sense, that is, intuitions understood as\nresponses to fully understanding propositions (1998: 202). Casullo\nseems to understand intuitions differently, as a certain kind of\nmental state whose nature must be discovered empirically. Insofar as a\ndefense of rationalism involves a defense of the epistemic role of\nintuitions, it is not surprising that Bealer and Casullo suggest\ndifferent ways of defending rationalism given that they have different\nviews about the nature of intuitions.\n6. Should we doubt the evidential force of intellectual intuitions?\n6.1 What exactly is an intellectual seeming or rational intuition?\n\nWe have seen that Bealer thinks that a rational intuition is a modal\nseeming: either a seeming to be true and necessarily true, or a\nseeming to be possible. In other places Russell (2017: 232) defines an\na priori intuition as the psychological state people are in\nwhen some proposition seems true to them solely on the basis\nof their understanding that proposition. This definition of an a\npriori intuition allows us to distinguish between what Bealer\ncalled a physical intuition that a house undermined will fall, because\nit does not seem true to us solely on the basis of understanding what\nit says, and the intuition that if P, then not not P, or\nthat if someone knows P, then she believes P and\nP is true. Unlike on Bealer\u2019s account of rational\nintuitions, this account of intuition does not require that the\npropositions that are the objects of intuitions be modal. It provides\na way of distinguishing a priori justifiable necessary\npropositions such as Necessarily, all bachelors are unmarried\nmales from empirically justifiable necessary propositions such as\nNecessarily, water is H2O since an intuition that\nthe former proposition is true can be based solely on a person\u2019s\nunderstanding it but an intuition that the latter is true must be\nbased partly on understanding how things are in the external world.\nThis account of intuition also allows that what are called synthetic\na priori proposition (like\n 10a\u201314a)\n can be the objects of a priori intuitions since they can\nseem true to a person solely on the basis of her understanding\nthem.\n\nSeveral philosophers appeal to the understanding in their accounts of\na priori justification: Bealer in all his many essays;\nBonJour 1998; Jackson 2000; Peacocke 2000; Sosa 2013: 199; Boghossian:\nforthcomingb. But the view also has its critics. Though Paul\nBoghossian thinks that some a priori justification stems from\nthat source, he thinks that a priori intuitions about\nsubstantive normative propositions can provide justification but they\ndo not rest on our understanding those propositions (forthcomingb).\nConsider the proposition that It is always wrong to torture\nchildren just for the fun of it. His argument is that if such\nintuitions were based on understanding the concept\n\u201cwrong\u201d, then it would not make sense to ask whether that\nsort of act merits disapproval or should be punished, assuming for the\nsake of argument that the correct account of the non-substantive\nmeaning of \u201cwrong\u201d is in terms of what merits disapproval\nor should be punished. But he thinks that this question always makes\nsense. So it follows that a priori normative intuitions of\nthis sort are not based on understanding the relevant normative\nconcepts. Boghossian seems to think that this argument generalizes to\napply to all a priori intuitions whose objects are synthetic\npropositions, not just to intuitions about substantive normative\npropositions.\n\nA possible response to Boghossian is that full or\ndeep understanding of normative concepts like\n\u201cwrong\u201d requires understanding that certain paradigm cases\nare wrong, though a more superficial understanding which can be\ncaptured by non-substantive account of wrong does not. An analogy with\ncausation might help. A superficial understanding of why opium causes\nsleep is that it has dormative powers. But a deeper, more detailed\nunderstanding would involve understanding how the chemicals in opium\naffect the neurons in the brain and how those in turn cause sleep.\nProblems will remain with the \u201clack of deep understanding\u201d\nreply to Boghossian\u2019s argument: how does one explain the fact\nthat professional moral philosophers sometimes have different\nintuitions about substantive claims about what is wrong? One would\nexpect them to have equally deep understanding of the relevant\nnormative concepts and so to have the same a priori\nintuitions on the understanding-based account of intuitions that\nBoghossian argues against. But sometimes they do not, as Boghossian\nnotes (forthcomingb). At the same time, he offers an explanation of\nwhy the intuitions of philosophers diverge: the theories they hold can\naffect the intuitions they have.\n6.2 Experimental philosophy\n\nA new branch of philosophy called experimental philosophy (X-phi for\nshort) has studied the intuitive judgments of people (often\nstudents) when presented with well-known examples in epistemology and\nethics. They ask these people (often from different ethnic, cultural,\neconomic, and educational backgrounds) whether someone in a\nhypothetical scenario knows, or only believes, that some proposition\nis true, say, in Sheep whether the person knows, or only\nbelieves, that there are sheep in the field. In ethics they may\npresent the subjects with a case and ask them if it is wrong, or not\nwrong, to do what is described. In a case often called\nTransplant, five innocent people are desperately in need of\ncertain vital organs, and the only way to save them is to cut up some\ninnocent person and distribute his organs to the five (transplant\nsurgery has been perfected and our potential donor is a perfect match\nto all five). Experimental philosophers will ask their subjects\nwhether it is wrong, or not wrong, to cut up the one to save the five,\nand then record their intuitive judgments. In another case\noften called Trolley, a runaway trolley is on track A\nand headed for five innocent people who are trapped on that track. All\nperson S can do to keep the trolley from running over the five\nis to turn the trolley down track B where one innocent person\nis trapped. If S does nothing, five will die; if he throws the\nswitch via a remote device, the one on track B will be killed.\nOr what if someone pushed a heavy person in front of the trolley to\nstop it from running over the five? Experimental philosophers ask\nwhether it would be wrong, or not wrong, for S to throw the\nswitch or push the man. They record the data, which they take to be\nintuitive judgments on the cases, and note differences in the\nresponses, say, between different ethnic or economic groups.\n\nSome of the initial studies that seemed to show that there are\ndifferences along ethnic, cultural, and economic lines in response to\nexamples have not been replicated (see Turri 2018; Wykstra 2018 for an\noverview of the work in X-Phi.). Other studies have been criticized\nbecause of their experimental design. Apart from these experimental\nflaws, claims about disagreements in intuition have been criticized as\nepistemically irrelevant because the so-called\n\u201cintuitions\u201d of subjects are not what philosophers have in\nmind when they refer to a priori or rational intuitions\n(Bealer 1998: 202, 213). If what philosophers mean by\n\u201cintuitions\u201d requires that they stem from full\nunderstanding of concepts in ideal cognitive circumstances, then the\n\u201cintuitions\u201d that experimental subjects have do not\nqualify, for they lack full understanding and the cognitive\ncircumstances they are in probably do not qualify as ideal.\n\nOne might think that from an epistemic standpoint, the\n\u201cintuitions\u201d that philosophers have when considering\n\u201csuitably elementary propositions\u201d are what should be\nstudied because, as Bealer said, \u201cif we limit ourselves to\nsuitably elementary propositions, then relative to them we\napproximate ideal cognitive conditions\u201d, and\nphilosophers come nearer to having a full understanding of the\nrelevant concepts. Studies of that sort are being done (see\nSchwitzgebel & Cushman 2012, 2015). Some results suggest that\nphilosophers\u2019 intuitions, like those of non-philosophers, are\naffected by how an example is described (called \u201cframing\neffects\u201d) and by the order in which the examples are presented\n(\u201cordering effects\u201d). This suggests that the intuitions of\nphilosophers are no more reliable than those of non-philosophers. But\nperhaps the experimental situation is not ideal and that ideal\nconditions are the ordinary settings in which philosophers do their\nwork. (See, Kahneman\u2019s description (2011: 234\u2013235) of the\napproach taken by Gary Klein and his followers who criticize\nartificial experiments and recommend studying \u201creal people doing\nthings that matter\u201d (Kahneman 2011: 235).\n6.3 Can intuitions be checked for accuracy?\n\nA different sort of objection to intuitions as a source of a\npriori evidence assumes that a source of justification must be\ncapable of being calibrated to determine whether it is accurate\n(Cummins 1998: 116\u2013118). What we see through a telescope\njustifies us in believing that the moon has mountains because we have\ndone things like looking through telescopes at distant mountains on\nearth and then gone to them and discovered that the telescopes\npresented an accurate picture of the mountains. But what, the\nobjection goes, can intuitions be checked against? Other intuitions?\nBut that is like checking a crystal ball against itself.\n\nBonJour has argued that many errors involving apparent rational\ninsights (intuitions) can be corrected internally by further\nreflection, or by appealing to coherence (BonJour 1998:\n116\u2013119). Others have replied that neither perception nor memory\n(Goldman 2007: 5) can be checked either, except against themselves,\nbut that does not prevent these sources from providing justification\nin certain circumstances.\n\nIn reply to this sort of response, critics of intuition-based views of\na priori justification have said that at least different\ntypes of perception can be checked against each other, say, vision\nagainst touch (Weatherson 2003: 4). The critics of intuition add that\nwhile we can distinguish circumstances where, say, vision is\nunreliable from circumstance where it is not, nothing similar can be\ndone when it is a matter of intuitions. For instance, we can\ndistinguish conditions where the lighting conditions, or the\nperson\u2019s eyesight, are bad from ones where they are not. We can\nknow whether we are in a desert where optical illusions occur and\nwhether we are not. At least sometimes we can tell whether we are\nhallucinating or not.\n\nFirst, the thought that a potential source of justification must be\ncapable of being calibrated if it is to provide justification seems\nfalse. The people inside Plato\u2019s cave who can only see shadows\ncast on the wall in front of them can be justified in believing that\nthose shadows have a certain shape based on what they see and the\nreports of others. A priori intuitions involve a kind of\nintellectual \u201cseeing\u201d, and they can be checked against\nother people\u2019s reports of their intuitions. That one type of\nperception can be checked against another (say, sight against touch)\ndoes not seem to count for much epistemically. Perhaps a ouija board\ncan be checked against a crystal ball, but without some further\nexplanation, neither agreement, nor disagreement, between them would\nhave significant epistemic implications. Perhaps intellectual or\nrational intuitions produced under certain circumstances should be\ndiscounted, viz., those produced by people who are angry, depressed,\ndrunk, tired, etc., or who are not impartial, have something at stake\nin the outcome, or have not reflected carefully on the relevant\nconcept. But that does not mean that all of them should be discounted.\nCalibration may not be necessary for justification. And in some\ncircumstances it seems insufficient, as when there is good reason to\nthink that agreement is accidental or the result of causes irrelevant\nfrom an epistemic standpoint.\n6.4 Naturalized epistemology\n\nThere are other objections to the reliance on intuitions in philosophy\nthat do not call into question their reliability. They call into\nquestion their relevance. Casullo (2003) proposes to treat\n\u201cexperience\u201d as a natural kind term, and Hilary Kornblith\nand Philip Kitcher propose to treat epistemic terms such as\n\u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cjustification\u201d in that way\ntoo. Kornblith thinks that intuitions can help direct us to the\nappropriate objects, or phenomena, of investigation but not much more.\nFor instance, we have an intuition that knowledge is not a type of\nfurniture so we should not start our empirical investigation into the\nessential nature of knowledge by looking at furniture (Kornblith 1998,\n2005, 2006). If we think of normative terms such as\n\u201cwrong\u201d as natural kind terms, and so as analogous to a\nnatural kind term like \u201cwater\u201d, there would be some\nreference-fixing description associated with \u201cwrong\u201d as\nthere is for \u201cwater\u201d. For \u201cwater\u201d that\ndescription is something like: the stuff, whatever it is,\nthat in the actual world has the properties of quenching\nthirst, putting out certain fires, falling from the clouds as rain,\nfilling the lakes and rivers, etc., on the planet on which we live.\nEmpirical investigation is then needed to discover what this\nreference-fixing description in fact refers to. On Kornblith\u2019s\nview, there is little room for rational intuitions to play in\ndiscovering the essential nature of knowledge or normative kinds. They\ndo not play a role in determining the content of any relevant\nreference-fixing description and, at most, tell us where not\nto look to find what does fulfill a given description.\n\nIt would be a mistake to take \u201ccube\u201d to be a natural kind\nterm understood through some reference-fixing description such as: a\nthree-dimensional solid that looks such-and-such a way when looked at\nfrom various angles and that feels so-and-so when turned around in\nyour hands; is able to fit snugly through square holes cut out of a\nboard, etc. \u201cCube\u201d is not a natural kind term and we\nunderstand what a cube is through understanding its definition,\nnamely, a three-dimensional solid with six faces all of which are\nsquares.\n\nRational intuitions seem relevant to testing proposed definitions of\n\u201ccube\u201d, but not proposed reference-fixing descriptions of\n\u201cwater\u201d. If someone thought that the correct definition of\n\u201ccube\u201d is: a three-dimensional solid with six faces\nall of which are parallelograms with equal sides, we could show\nit is not a correct definition of \u201ccube\u201d by imagining a\n\u201csquished\u201d cube that satisfies that definition but,\nintuitively, is not a cube. None of the properties mentioned in the\nreference-fixing description for water are either necessary, or taken\nsingly or together, sufficient conditions of a liquid\u2019s being\nwater. So it does not seem that rational intuitions could play much of\na role in determining what the essential nature of knowledge is if\n\u201cknowledge\u201d were a natural kind term whose reference is\nfixed by some description. People would have to empirically discover\nthe nature of knowledge with the aid of its reference-fixing\ndescription, just as they had to empirically discover the nature of\nwater. The same thing would seem to apply to normative terms like\n\u201cright\u201d or \u201cwhat there is most reason to do (or\nbelieve)\u201d if they were natural kind terms.\n\nOn the basis of thinking about these examples involving\n\u201cwater\u201d and \u201ccube\u201d, a person might think that\nwhether rational intuitions have a small or a large role in\ndiscovering the essential nature of normative concepts, and other\nconcepts of interest to philosophers, depends on whether those\nconcepts are like the concept of water or instead like that\nof cube. But Peter Railton\u2019s view that normative terms\nare natural kind terms allows for a large role for rational intuitions\nin determining their reference-fixing descriptions.\n\nRailton calls a reference-fixing description a \u201cjob\ndescription\u201d. He is interested in normative concepts like\nright and what there is most reason to do, and\ndescribes in general terms what a job description might include.\nRailton says that there may not be much to say about \u201cthe\nconcept of a reason full stop\u201d. Perhaps all we can say\nin that regard is that a reason is a consideration that counts in\nfavor of something: an action, a desire, an emotion, a belief, etc.\nBut Railton thinks that the concept most reason to do has\n\n\n\na distinctive, all-important role in your conceptual scheme\u2014it\nexpresses \u201cstops the buck\u201d in deliberating and deciding\nwhat we ought to do, what ultimately matters. \n\n\nHe goes on to add that the relevant \u201cjob description\u201d\nincludes reference to paradigm cases. For example, it is assumed that\nagony gives everyone some reason to avoid performing actions that\nproduce it, that vengeance is not itself a reason to do something, and\nthat acrophobia sometimes is not a sufficient reason to avoid doing\nsomething that will save your life (Railton 2017a: 51).\n\nIn another essay on Parfit\u2019s On What Matters, Vol III,\nRailton says that the job description of rightness is \n\n\nnecessarily connected to the guidance of deliberation,\u2026,has\nanalytic connections to ought claims about action and\nmotivation,\u2026,has certain paradigm cases, etc. \n\n\nHe thinks that the job description of minimizing suffering is\ncompletely different (Railton 2017b: 118\u2013119). Nevertheless,\nRailton thinks that the two concepts might refer to the same thing in\nthe way that water and H2O refer to the\nsame thing despite being different concepts. That will be true if the\nacts that have the naturalistic property of minimizing suffering\nuniquely (or best) fulfill the job description associated with the\nnormative concept rightness.\n\nRational intuitions might play a role in Railton\u2019s view that\nnormative terms are natural kind terms by supplying the paradigm cases\nthat are elements of the job descriptions associated with normative\nconcepts. He says that it is \u201cinconceivable\u201d that there\nnot be reason to stop prolonged agony that is being inflicted on\nsomeone just for amusement (2017a: 56). On Railton\u2019s view, to\ndetermine what the natures of right, reason, most reason, etc., are\nyou need to consider more than just what rational intuitions might\nreveal. They can help determine what paradigm cases should be included\nin the relevant \u201cjob description\u201d, but that description\nincludes more than just paradigm cases. On Railton\u2019s view,\ninsofar as \u201cold style\u201d analytic philosophy only considered\nthe data supplied by rational intuitions, it mistakenly left important\ndata aside. This is true of attempts to analyze normative concepts but\nalso true of attempts to analyze other concepts that have been of\ninterest to philosophers, for example, knowledge, causality,\npersonal identity, justice, being morally responsible, acting\nfreely, etc.\n\nRailton\u2019s view is that normative concepts are hybrid concepts,\nsomewhat like the concept of ruby as a red gemstone\nwith such-and-such chemical structure (see\n example 15)\n or of an ice cube. \u201cIce\u201d is a natural kind term,\nor at least its definition as \u201cfrozen water\u201d is partly\ngiven by the natural kind term, \u201cwater\u201d. But, as we have\nseen, \u201ccube\u201d is not a natural kind terms. So \u201cice\ncube\u201d is partly a natural kind term and partly not.\n6.5 Pragmatism\n\nAnother approach that discounts the role of intuitions in philosophy,\nespecially in epistemology, is pragmatic. The idea is to first\ndetermine what epistemic goals we want principles to serve, and then\nto discover empirically which epistemic principles, if adhered to,\nwill best serve those goals (Weinberg 2006). For instance, your goal\nmight be to have lots of true beliefs or, alternatively, to have few\nfalse ones. Or your goal might be to have beliefs that make you happy.\nProbably the best set of rules to follow to obtain lots of true\nbeliefs will be different from, and more lenient than, the best set of\nrules to follow to avoid having false beliefs. Probably those sets of\nrules will be different from the set of rules you should adopt if you\nare interested in having beliefs that make you happy. It\u2019s\nreasonable to think that intuitions will have to be appealed to in\ndetermining what makes a goal an epistemic goal rather than\nsome other sort of goal, and what precisely that epistemic goal is.\nLehrer (1986: 6\u20137) holds that the epistemic goal is not\nto maximize true beliefs or minimize false ones. For him, it is the\nfollowing: for any proposition, P, that a person is\nconsidering, believe P if and only if it is true. Intuition\nmust be relied on to determine what the epistemic goal is.\nIntuitively, Pascal\u2019s Wager is about whether belief in God pays,\nnot about whether there is good evidence to believe that God exists or\ndoes not exist. The goal of the argument is not epistemic but\npragmatic in a narrow sense, namely, to believe what will make your\nlife, including your afterlife, go best for you. Intuitively, the goal\nof having beliefs that will make your life go well is not an epistemic\ngoal. Epistemic goals have to do with truth, fitting your beliefs to\nthe evidence, having evidentially justified beliefs, etc.\n\nThe pragmatic approach that sketched here seems doomed at the outset:\nit cannot avoid appealing to intuitions in order to determine what the\ncorrect epistemic goal is. And if it is appropriate to appeal to\nintuitions to determine the correct epistemic goal, why not also other\nepistemic intuitions to determine what knowledge, justification, etc.,\nare?\n7. Even if intuitions can justify, can they yield knowledge of the external world?\n\nSuppose, for the sake of argument, we grant that intuitions\nproperly understood and had under ideal conditions by people with\na deep understanding of the relevant concepts can justify certain\npropositions. But can they yield knowledge about the external\nworld? Carrie Jenkins has argued that they can insofar as the\nconcepts that play a role in a priori justification have been\nshaped by experience. She thinks that for knowledge (not\njustification) our concepts must be grounded. By this she\nmeans that they must accurately and non-accidentally represent the\nworld. So the concept table can be grounded for a person in a\nworld where there are tables but not for a brain-in-a-vat (BIV)\n(Jenkins 2008a: 128\u201329). For a concept to be\njustified for Jenkins is for it to be\n\u201crespectable\u201d for us to rely on it (by which, I believe,\nshe means that we would be epistemically blameless in relying on it)\nas \u201ca relevantly accurate guide to the world\u201d (Jenkins\n2008a: 129). So a BIV can have a justified, though not a grounded\nconcept, about things existing in the external world.\n\nJenkins thinks that our concepts are grounded. Her argument for\nthinking this is that our basic concepts are useful, and in that\nrespect they are sort of like maps. If they did not fit the world\n(weren\u2019t grounded) even though they are founded on sensory\ninput, their usefulness would be a miracle. They would be like a map\nthat fits the world that was based on a dream. Since we should not\nbelieve in miracles, those concepts must fit the world. The best\nexplanation of the usefulness of our concepts is that they accurately\nrepresent features of the world that produce our sensory inputs that\nallow us to navigate successfully in the world. She thinks that this\nNo-Miracles Argument shows that it is reasonable to think that our\nconcepts (or groups of concepts) mirror the world\u2019s structure\n(Jenkins 2008a: 139). If we have justified concepts, ones we\nhave reason to think fit the world, we can examine them to see what\nthey involve and then have a priori justification for\nbelieving that certain propositions that involve them are true of\nthe world. So, on her view, we (but not BIVs) could know a\npriori, merely on the basis of examining our concepts,\nthat all vixens are female and that there are (or at least\nwere) vixens, and that all bachelors are unmarried and that\nthere are (or at least were) bachelors. If we have grounded\nconcepts, we (but not BIVs) can have a priori knowledge that\nall of these propositions are true. Yet gaining this sort of knowledge\nabout our external environment a priori seems impossible.\n\nFurther, it is not obvious that all a priori knowledge rests\non grounded concepts. Normative or mathematical concepts might map the\nnormative and mathematical domains but not the external world. We can\nknow a priori that it is wrong to torture children just for\nthe fun of it and that two is the only even prime regardless of what\nthe external world is like. Perhaps we can also know a priori\nthat some general normative principles are true, such as the principle\nof inference to the best explanation (IBE). Roughly, this principle\nsays that we are justified in believing some hypothesis if it is the\nbest explanation of what we observe. For instance, it says that we are\njustified in believing that someone recently walked along the beach\nbecause that best explains our observation of footprints in the sand.\nBut we could not be justified in accepting IBE because it is useful\nand the best explanation of its usefulness is that it fits the way the\nworld is. That would be a circular argument for accepting IBE. Lastly,\nit seems possible for even a BIV to know certain conditional\npropositions, for instance, to know that that IF something is a vixen,\nit is a female fox and IF someone is bachelor, he is an unmarried\nmale.\n\nJenkins allows that some concepts can be grounded, even if they are\nnot directly grounded, provided they are constituted by grounded\nconcepts, but it is hard to see how the concepts spiritual\nand immaterial could be so constituted. Still, it seems that\nwe can know a priori that if there are angels, there are\nspiritual beings and if there are immaterial beings, they do\nnot occupy space.\n\nIt is one thing to hold that a priori knowledge requires\nenabling empirical experience to acquire the concepts that are the\nbasis of that sort of knowledge, and quite another thing to hold that\nthose concepts must be grounded in such experience. The latter rules\nout some seemingly obvious kinds of a priori knowledge (viz.,\nsome mathematical and normative knowledge, and knowledge of certain\nconditional propositions which seem merely to be about the\nrelationship of concepts), and so seems too strong. It also seems to\nallow in a priori knowledge of the existence of, say, foxes\nand bachelors, and so seems too weak.\n8. What is a priori knowledge?\n\nIt is widely, though not universally, held that knowledge is partly\nanalyzable in terms of justified true belief. But, as we\u2019ve\nseen, Gettier examples show that having a justified true belief is not\nsufficient for knowledge. We need some anti-luck condition in addition\nto JTB to rule out cases where there is a JTB but not knowledge\nbecause, in some sense, the person in the Gettier situation is lucky\nto have a true belief given the way his evidence is related to the\ntruth of his belief.\n\nThe Lottery Paradox suggests that even more than JTB and an anti-luck\ncondition are required for knowledge. The chances that you hold the\nwinning ticket in a one million ticket lottery is one in a million,\nand that you hold a losing ticket, 999,999 in a million. Suppose you\nknow what the probability of your holding a losing ticket is and that\nyou in fact have a losing ticket. Then you seem to have a justified\nbelief that your ticket is a loser (because you know that\u2019s very\nlikely true), and it is true that it is a loser. Assume, also, that\nyou are not in a Gettier situation. Still, you do not seem to know\nthat your ticket is a losing one. It seems that you need further\nconfirmation from a trustworthy source to know your ticket has\nlost.\n\nIf knowledge in general is justified true belief plus some condition\nto handle Gettier cases and another to handle the Lottery Paradox,\nthen on the account of knowledge that requires you to have a justified\ntrue belief, a priori knowledge will be a priori\njustified true belief plus some conditions to deal with Gettier and\nLottery Paradox cases. Specific versions of this view of a\npriori knowledge will depend on specific versions of a\npriori justification.\n\nBut there are rival accounts of knowledge that reject the view that\nknowledge is partly analyzable in terms of justification. One such\nview is called knowledge reliabilism; the other, the \u201cknowledge\nfirst\u201d view. Knowledge reliabilism is the view that a person\nknows P if and only if she has a reliably produced true belief,\nand a priori knowledge reliabilism would say a similar thing\nabout a priori knowledge. Perhaps just having reliable\nintuitions would be enough to have a priori knowledge\nregardless of whether they provided justification or not.\n\nThere are well-known examples that count against the idea that\nreliably produced true belief is sufficient for knowledge. Let\nTruenorth be a person who has true beliefs about what direction is\nnorth, south, etc., even when blindfolded. He has a kind of internal\ncompass like the ones found in migratory birds. But assume that\nTruenorth has no reason to think that his beliefs about compass\ndirections are accurate; he has never received confirmation of their\naccuracy, neither from the testimony of others nor by checking things\nout himself. Nevertheless, he is confident that his beliefs about what\ndirection is north, etc., are correct. Assume, also, that he has no\nreason to think that others in his society have, nor that they lack,\nhis directional ability. In general, assume that there are no\nundefeated defeaters of Truenorth\u2019s beliefs about what direction\nis north, etc. Intuitively, it seems that if he believes that some\ndirection he points to is north, he is not justified in believing,\nnor does he know, that it is north, even if what he believes\nregarding compass directions is always true.\n\nIf this is a problem for reliabilists about empirical\nknowledge, it may also be a problem for reliabilists when it comes to\na priori knowledge. Mere reliability does not seem sufficient\nfor knowledge. What seems missing in the case of Truenorth is any\nreason for him to think that his beliefs about compass directions are\nreliable. Perhaps what is missing on reliabilist accounts of a\npriori knowledge is similar, namely, that the subject lacks any\nreason to think that her a priori intuitions are reliable\neven if they are.\n\nBrian Weatherson offers an example involving a person he calls\n\u201cTamati\u201d, a young mathematician who has a sudden strong\nconviction that there is no largest prime upon noticing that as primes\nget larger the gap between them also gets larger (2019: 125\u201326).\nTamati believes that there is no largest prime on the basis of his\nstrong conviction, and Weatherson explains how Tamati\u2019s strong\nconvictions about mathematical propositions are reliable. But,\nintuitively, Tamati is not justified in believing, nor does he know,\nthat there is no largest prime without a proof that it\u2019s true.\nSo reliability is not sufficient for justification or knowledge even\nin the realm of the a priori.\n\nViews that see knowledge as resting on justification, whether\nempirical or a priori, might be said to make justification\nfirst. A \u201cknowledge first\u201d view sees justification as\nderivative at best. It equates one\u2019s total evidence with\none\u2019s total knowledge (Williamson 2014: 8; see, also, 4). If\njustification is a function of evidence, knowledge implies\njustification, but according to Williamson justification is not part\nof what knowledge is. He holds that knowledge is not analyzable even\npartly in terms of justification.\n\nThere seem to be clear counterexamples to the knowledge first view.\nSuppose you are driving out in the country and first pass by one of\nmany fields where sheep are grazing, and then a little later pass by\nthe field with the poodles that look just like sheep. In the first\ncases, you knew there were sheep in the field, but in the last case\nyou did not. Still, weren\u2019t you just as justified, didn\u2019t\nyou have the same sort of evidence, in the last case as in the first\nones? No, says Williamson, a defender of the knowledge first view. You\nare just as epistemically blameless in the last case as in\nthe earlier ones because, for all you know, you are looking at real\nsheep. You have a legitimate excuse for believing that you are looking\nat sheep, but you don\u2019t have evidence, nor are you justified in\nbelieving, that you are looking at sheep when you are looking at\npoodles (Williamson 2014: 4\u20135).\n\nWilliamson\u2019s criticism of any justified true belief account of\nknowledge would rest on the fact that no one has yet been able to\nsolve the Gettier problem (2014: 1\u20132), nor give a good account\nof what it is for beliefs to be justified because they fit the\nevidence. According to him, the attempt to analyze knowledge is in a\nshambles, and the knowledge first approach promises to shed light on\nthe nature of indiscriminability, norms of assertion, and epistemic\nlogic (2014: 6\u20137). So it promises to be fruitful while the old\napproach of analyzing knowledge has left behind a path strewn with\nfailures. This, says Williamson, is a good reason to change horses.\nBut Williamson\u2019s view seems to have its own liabilities. On the\nknowledge-first approach that he develops, you don\u2019t have any\nevidence that there are sheep in the field when you are looking at the\npoodles, and human footprints in the sand are not evidence that\nsomeone recently walked there if they were made by a monkey wearing\nrubber feet. The new horse bucks.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Audi, Robert, 1997, <em>Moral Knowledge and Ethical\nCharacter</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2001, <em>The Architecture of Reason: The\nStructure and Substance of Rationality</em>, Oxford: Oxford University\nPress. doi:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195158427.001.0001", "Bealer, George, 1987, \u201cThe Philosophical Limits of\nScientific Essentialism\u201d, <em>Philosophical Perspectives</em>,\n1: 289\u2013365. doi:10.2307/2214149", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1992, \u201cThe Incoherence of\nEmpiricism\u201d, <em>Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume</em>,\n66: 99\u2013137. doi:10.1093/aristoteliansupp/66.1.99", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1996a, \u201c<em>A Priori</em> Knowledge\nand the Scope of Philosophy\u201d and \u201c<em>A Priori</em>\nKnowledge: Replies to William Lycan and Ernest Sosa\u201d,\n<em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 81)2\u20133): 121\u2013142 and\n163\u2013174, respectively; Bealer\u2019s essay is reprinted in\n2008, <em>Epistemology: An Anthology</em>, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition,\nErnest Sosa, et al.
