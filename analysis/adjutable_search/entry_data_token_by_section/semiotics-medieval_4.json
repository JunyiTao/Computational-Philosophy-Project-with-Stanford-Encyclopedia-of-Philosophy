The genesis of an elaborate theory of signs in the second half of 13th century\n\n\nThe genesis of an elaborate theory of signs in the second half of\nthe 13th century is the result of a complex interplay of\nAristotelian and Augustinian influences. Since the mid-13th\ncentury Augustinian views, until then effective mainly in theological\ndiscussions, begin to invade the faculties of arts. Due to this, the\nsign is increasingly taken as the basic concept of the\n\u2018linguistic science\u2019 (scientia\nsermocinalis):[16]\n \u201cSpeech is nothing but a sign\u201d\n(Sermo totaliter signum est), Robert Kilwardby asserts\n(Kilwardby De ortu scientiarum, 1976, 160). Roger Bacon\npraises the sign even as the principal instrument of all Liberal\n Arts.[17]\n It is true, the consciousness of words\nbeing signs is nothing new. From this point onward, however, it gives\nrise, at first in the framework of grammar theory, to semiotic\nreflections that go beyond what is known from earlier centuries.\n",
