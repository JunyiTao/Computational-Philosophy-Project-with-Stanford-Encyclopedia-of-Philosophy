    "preamble": "\n\nAccording to the classical theism of Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas and\ntheir adherents, God is radically unlike creatures and cannot be\nadequately understood in ways appropriate to them. God is simple in\nthat God transcends every form of complexity and composition familiar\nto the discursive intellect. One consequence is that the simple God\nlacks parts. This lack is not a deficiency but a positive feature. God\nis ontologically superior to every partite entity, and his\npartlessness is an index thereof. Broadly construed,\n\u2018part\u2019 covers not only spatial and temporal parts (if any)\nbut also metaphysical \u2018parts\u2019 or ontological constituents.\nTo say that God lacks metaphysical parts is to say inter alia\nthat God is free of matter-form composition, potency-act composition,\nand existence-essence composition. There is also no real distinction\nbetween God as subject of his attributes and his attributes. God is\nthus in some sense identical to each of his attributes, which\nimplies that each attribute is identical to every other one. God is\nomniscient, then, not in virtue of instantiating or exemplifying\nomniscience \u2014 which would imply a real distinction between God\nand the property of omniscience \u2014 but by being\nomniscience. And the same holds for each of the divine\nomni-attributes: God is what he has as Augustine\nputs it in The City of God, XI, 10. As identical to each of\nhis attributes, God is identical to his nature. And since his nature\nor essence is identical to his existence, God is identical to his\nexistence. This is the doctrine of divine simplicity (DDS). But how\nare we to understand \u2018identity\u2019 in this context? Is it an\nequivalence relation governed by the Indiscernibility of Identicals?\nOr is it some \u2018looser\u2019 form of sameness? These are\nimportant questions but ones that cannot be addressed in this entry\nexcept in passing.\n\nDDS is represented not only in classical Christian theology, but also\nin Jewish, Greek, and Islamic thought. Moses Maimonides, for example,\nheld that in God, \u201cwhose existence is not due to any cause\n\u2026 existence and essence are perfectly identical.\u201d\n(The Guide for the Perplexed, Part One, LVII). DDS is to be\nunderstood as an affirmation of God\u2019s absolute transcendence of\ncreatures. God is not only radically non-anthropomorphic, but\nradically unlike creatures in general, not only in respect of the\nproperties he possesses, but also in his manner of possessing them. It\nis not just that God has properties no creature has; the properties he\nhas he has in a way different from the way any creature has any of its\nproperties. God has his properties by being them. Some explain DDS by\nsaying that God has no properties; this gloss, however, carries the\nunfortunate suggestion that God is a bare particular. It is better to\nput the point in a positive way by saying that God has properties, not\nby instantiating or exemplifying them, but by being them. Unique in\nhis mode of property-possession, God is also unique in his mode of\nexistence and in his modal status. He is not just one necessary being\namong others. His metaphysical necessity, unlike that of other\nnecessary beings, is grounded in his simplicity. The actually infinite\nset of natural numbers is presumably a necessary being, along with\neach of its members, but neither set nor members are necessary in\nvirtue of being ontologically simple. So while one may say that the\nsimple God exists in all metaphysically possible worlds, that is no\naccount of his unique mode of necessity, which is grounded in his\nsimplicity. God is necessary because he is simple and not because he\nexists in all metaphysically possible worlds. And while one may say\nthat the simple God is or exists, God is not an existent among\nexistents or a being among beings, but Being (esse) itself in\nits prime instance and in this respect is different from every other\nbeing (ens). Unique in all these ways, God is\nuniquely unique. He is not unique as one of a kind, but\nunique in transcending the distinction between kind and member of a\nkind. God is unique in his very mode of uniqueness. The simple God, we\ncould say, differs not only in his attributes, but also in his very\nontological structure, from any and all created beings.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Motivation\n\nWhat could motivate such a strange and seemingly incoherent doctrine?\nOne central consideration in its favor derives from the Anselmian\ndefinition of God as maximally perfect, as that than which no greater\ncan be conceived. A God who was less than maximally perfect would not\nbe an absolute reality and an appropriate object of worship. A God who\nwas less than ultimate and absolute would be an idol. Now an absolute\nreality must be a se, from itself, and so not dependent on\nanything distinct from itself either for its nature or for its\nexistence. If God had properties in the way creatures have them,\nhowever, he would be distinct from them and so dependent on them. This\nis the case whether one thinks of a property of x as a\nconstituent of x, or as an entity external to x to\nwhich x is tied by the asymmetrical relation (or\nnonrelational tie) of instantiation. If the properties of x\nare constituents or ontological (proper) parts of x, then\nx will depend on them in the same way that any whole composed\nof parts depends on its parts. But if x is tied to its\nproperties by the asymmetrical relation of instantiation, it is still\nthe case that x will depend on them: if x is\nF in virtue of x\u2019s instantiation of\nF-ness, then F-ness is a logically prior condition\nof x\u2019s being F. In sum, the divine aseity\nwould seem to require that God be rather than have\nhis attributes.\n\nOne can also arrive at the simplicity doctrine via the divine\nnecessity. As maximally perfect, as that than which no greater can be\nconceived, God must be a metaphysically necessary being, one that\ncannot not exist. A necessary being is one whose possibility entails\nits existence, and whose nonexistence entails its impossibility. But\nwhat could be the ground of this necessity of existence if not the\nidentity in God of essence and existence, possibility and actuality?\nSaying that God exists in all metaphysically possible worlds does not\nprovide a ground, but merely a graphic Leibnizian representation, of\nthe notion of necessary being. The possible worlds representation also\ndoes not distinguish the necessity of God from that of an abstract\nobject such as the set of even primes. God is not just another\nnecessary being among necessary beings; he is uniquely necessary as\nthe source and ground of everything distinct from himself, including\nall non-divine necessary beings. Indeed, God is uniquely unique, i.e.,\nunique in his mode of uniqueness, in that he is not one of a kind, or\nnecessarily one of a kind, but unique in transcending the\nkind-instance difference altogether. A divine being cannot possess\ncontingent modal status: if God exists, then he is necessary, and if\nhe does not exist, then he is impossible. So if God exists, then there\nis a very tight connection between the divine nature and the divine\nexistence. The simplicity doctrine in its traditional and strongest\nform assays this \u2018tightness\u2019 as identity. The divine\nsimplicity thus grounds the divine necessity. God is necessary because\nhe is simple. It is easy to see that the divine simplicity also\ngrounds God\u2019s possession of essential properties. God has his\nattributes essentially because he is identical to his attributes.\nNothing is more essential to a thing than something to which it is\nidentical.\n\nA third motivation for DDS lies in the fact that it provides a\nsolution to the ancient Euthyphro dilemma first presented by Plato in\nhis eponymous dialog. Does God command the good because it is good,\nand forbid the bad because it is bad, or is the good good and the bad\nbad because God commands/forbids it? If the former, God\u2019s\nwilling would be subject to an external standard logically antecedent\nto God to the detriment of the divine sovereignty. If the latter, the\ncontent of morality would be arbitrary because subject to God\u2019s\nfree will. On DDS, however, the dilemma is a false alternative. If God\nis goodness itself in its prime instance, then he is not subject to a\nstandard; he is the standard. And if God, being simple, just is his\nwilling, then he cannot will anything other than the good and the\nappearance of arbitrarity vanishes. See Feser (2009, 129) who draws on\nStump (2003).\n\nNote that while the traditional approach to divine simplicity is in\nterms of identity, this approach is open to what Dolezal (2011,\n136\u2013144) calls the \u201charmonist challenge\u201d according\nto which, on one variation, that of Immink (1987), the divine\nattributes are not identical but necessarily equivalent. Dolezal also\ncounts Swinburne (1994) among the harmonists. Harmonism will not be\ndiscussed further in this entry. See Dolezal (2011) for competent\ncritique of harmonism and for an overall excellent defense of DDS.\n\nBesides perfection and necessity, immateriality, eternity, and\nimmutability also seem to point to simplicity as their ground. Because\nGod is simple, he cannot have parts and so cannot have material or\ntemporal parts. And because God is simple, he cannot harbor any\nunrealized potentialities, and so must be immutable. The centrality of\nDDS to medieval philosophical theology is shown by its position in the\norder of topics in Aquinas\u2019 Summa Theologica. It occurs\nas Question 3 right after Question 2 on the existence of God.\n\nFinally, the triune nature of the God of classical Christian theism\nmay also be taken as motivating DDS within Christian theology, and\nthis despite the initial suspicion that Trinity is incompatible with\ndivine simplicity. According to Wedgeworth (2019, 62),\n\u201cAthanasius of Alexandria consistently used the doctrine of\ndivine simplicity to argue that the Son\u2019s eternal Generation\nfrom the Father proved his absolute deity \u2026.\u201d To pursue\nthis further lies beyond the scope of this entry.\n2. The Question of Coherence\n\nThe very notion of an ontologically simple being will be dismissed by\nmany as self-evidently incoherent. Among theists, there are those who\nwill argue that DDS does not cohere with some other theistic\ncommitment such as the doctrine of the Trinity. The main concern of\nthis article is not with such intramural coherence questions, but with\nthe question of whether or not DDS is coherent at all. This broad\ncoherence question is not whether the doctrine is true, or even\npossibly true; the question is whether it is possible for us to think\nit without obvious contradictions and category mistakes. Ultimately,\nthe broad coherence question concerns the sort of general metaphysical\nframework that would allow DDS to be discussed as a live option as\nopposed to being dismissed as incoherent from the outset.\n\nA central threat to coherence is the question of how a thing could be\nidentical to its properties. Alvin Plantinga (1980, 47) maintains that\nif God is identical to his properties, then he is a property, and they\nare a single property, in which case God is a single property. Given\nthat properties are abstract entities, and abstracta are causally\ninert, then God is abstract and causally inert \u2014 which is of\ncourse inconsistent with the core tenet of classical theism according\nto which God is the personal creator and sustainer of every contingent\nbeing. No abstract object is either a person or a causal agent. No\nabstract object can be omniscient, or indeed know anything at all.\nMore fundamentally, no abstract entity can be identical to any\nconcrete entity. God as person and creator is concrete. Abstracta and\nconcreta are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive. Nothing can be\nboth. Objections similar to Plantinga\u2019s have been raised by\nRichard Gale (1991, 23 ff.), William Hasker (2016, 703) and\nothers.\n\nIt is easy to see that Plantinga-style objections will not appear\ndecisive to those who reject his metaphysical framework. Indeed,\nPlantinga\u2019s accusations of category mistake may strike students\nof the main medieval proponents of DDS as so many misunderstandings\nbased on a foisting of a foreign framework on their ideas. Plantinga,\nalong with many other philosophers, thinks of individuals and\nproperties as belonging to disjoint categories connected by an\nexternal relation of exemplification. Individuals are causally\nefficacious concreta whereas properties are causally impotent\nabstracta. Such an approach to ontology renders the divine simplicity\ninconceivable from the outset. For if God is a concrete individual and\nhis nature (conceived perhaps as the conjunction of his\nomni-attributes) is an abstract property, then the general ontology\nrules out any identity or sameness of God and his nature. Any such\nidentity or sameness would violate the separateness of the two\ncategories. To identify an unexemplifiable concretum with an\nexemplifiable abstractum would amount to a category mistake. At most,\na Plantinga-style approach allows for God\u2019s\nexemplification of his nature where the (first-level)\nexemplification relation, unlike the identity relation, is\nasymmetrical and irreflexive and so enforces the non-identity of its\nrelata. In short, if God exemplifies his nature, then God must be\ndistinct from his nature, just as Socrates must be distinct from his\nnature. God\u2019s nature is then something he has, by\nexemplification, not, pace Augustine, something he is by some\nform of identity or sameness.\n3. Constituent Versus Nonconstituent Ontology\n\nSince a Plantinga-type approach to ontology rules out DDS from the\noutset, no sophisticated adherent of the doctrine will adopt such an\napproach. The DDS defender will embrace an ontology that accommodates\nan ontologically simple being. Indeed, as Nicholas Wolterstorff (1991)\nnotes, classical proponents of DDS such as Aquinas had a radically\ndifferent ontological style, one that allowed for the coherent\nconceivability of DDS. They did not think of individuals as related to\ntheir properties as to abstracta external to them, but as having\nproperties as ontological constituents. They, and some atheist\ncontemporaries as well, think in terms of a \u201cconstituent\nontology\u201d as opposed to what Wolterstorff calls a\n\u201crelation ontology\u201d or what might be called a\n\u201cnonconstituent ontology\u201d. Bundle theories are\ncontemporary examples of constituent ontology. If properties are\nassayed as tropes and a concrete particular as a bundle of tropes,\nthen these tropes or abstract particulars are parts of concrete\nparticulars when suitably bundled. Properties so assayed are brought\nfrom Plato\u2019s heaven to earth. The togetherness or compresence of\ntropes in a trope bundle is not formal identity but a kind of\ncontingent sameness. Thus a redness trope and a sweetness trope in an\napple are not identical but contingently compresent as parts of the\nsame whole. A model such as this allows for an extrapolation to a\nnecessary compresence of the divine attributes in the case of God.\nAquinas, the greatest of the medieval proponents of DDS, is of course\nan Aristotelian, not a trope theorist. But he too is a constituent\nontologist. Form and matter, act and potency, and essence and\nexistence are constituents of primary substances. Essence and\nexistence in sublunary substances such as Socrates are really distinct\nbut inseparably together. Their unity is contingent. This model\npermits an extrapolation to the case of a being in which essence and\nexistence are necessarily together or compresent. Constituent\nontology, as murky as it must remain on a sketch such as this, at\nleast provides a framework in which DDS is somewhat intelligible as\nopposed to a Plantinga-style framework on which DDS remains wholly\nunintelligible. The arguments for DDS amount to arguments against the\nnonconstituent ontological framework.\n\nAdopting a constituent ontology will not, by itself, bring DDS into\nthe clear. Suppose properties (whether assayed as universals or as\ntropes) are ontological parts of the ordinary (thick) particulars that\nhave them and that this having is understood quasi-mereologically as a\nkind of part-whole relation rather than as an exemplification relation\nthat spans the abstract-concrete divide. This would still leave us\nwith the puzzle of how a whole could be identical to one of its proper\nparts, and the related puzzle of how two distinct proper parts could\nbe identical to each other. Construing properties as parts of the\nthings that have them does not, by itself, show how there could be a\nsimple being. But if properties are parts, then at least\nPlantinga\u2019s dismissal of DDS on the ground that nothing concrete\ncan be identical to anything abstract can itself be dismissed.\n\nWhat is needed to render DDS coherent is a particular version of\nconstituent ontology according to which a thing\u2019s nature is a\nunitary concrete item and a constituent of the thing. In the case of\nmaterial beings, the nature will be together with some individuating\nconstituent such as signate or designated matter (materia\nsignata). Material beings are individuated and diversified by\ntheir signate matter. Thus Socrates and Plato, though the same in\nnature, differ numerically in virtue of their different portions of\nmateria signata. Matter makes them individuals, and matter\nmakes them numerically diverse individuals. God, however, being\nimmaterial, is not individuated by anything distinct from his nature,\nand so can be said to be a self-individuating nature. As\nself-individuating, there is no real distinction between God and his\nnature. In Thomist terms, in God nature and suppositum are\nidentical.(ST I, q. 3, art. 3) The divine nature is not an\nabstract object related across an ontological chasm to a concrete\nindividual;the divine nature is a self-individuating concrete unitary\nnature. For Plantinga, the nature of a thing is a conjunctive property\nthe conjuncts of which are those properties the thing exemplifies in\nevery possible world in which it exists. On this approach, the divine\nnature is \u2018cobbled together\u2019 or constructed out of\nGod\u2019s essential properties. But then the divine nature is\nlogically and ontologically posterior to those properties. Clearly, no\ndefender of DDS will think of natures in this way. He will think of\nthe divine nature as logically and ontologically prior to the\nproperties, and of the properties as manifestations of that unitary\nnature, a nature the radical unity of which cannot be made sense of on\nPlantinga\u2019s approach. None of this is spectacularly clear, and\nplenty of questions remain; but it is not obviously incoherent as DDS\nwould be on the approach of Plantinga. And our question, you will\nrecall, is concerned solely with coherence.\n3.1 God and His Nature\n\nOne can see from the foregoing that Plantinga-type objections are not\ncompelling. The reason, again, is that DDS cannot be made sense of\nwithin a nonconstituent ontology. It can be made sense of, assuming it\ncan be made sense of, only within a constituent ontology, the style of\nontology presupposed by its main defender, Aquinas. A nonconstituent\nontologist like Plantinga may be represented as arguing by Modus\nPonens: If God exemplifies his nature, then he is distinct from it;\nGod exemplifies his nature; ergo, God is distinct from his nature, and\nDDS is false. But the constituent ontologist is justified in switching\nto Modus Tollens: If God exemplifies his nature, then he is distinct\nfrom it; God is not distinct from his nature; ergo, God does not\nexemplify his nature but has his nature by being identical with\nit.\n\nWe have just seen how God can be identical to his nature where\n\u201ccan be\u201d is elliptical for \u201ccan be conceived without\nobvious incoherence.\u201d But there are two other problems that also\npose a serious threat to the coherence of DDS. One concerns how God\ncan be identical to his existence, the other how the divine attributes\ncan be identical to each other.\n3.2 God and His Existence\n\nTaking the first question first, on a Plantinga-style approach, it\nmakes no sense to say that God is identical either to existence or to\nhis existence. For Plantinga, existence is a first-level\nproperty that everything exemplifies. Given that\n\u201cexemplifies\u201d picks out a two-term irreflexive and\nasymmetrical relation, God cannot be identical with existence. Nor can\nGod be identical to his existence. The latter is presumably a\nstate of affairs, an abstract object, and no concretum can be\nidentical with an abstractum on pain of violating the separateness of\nthe concrete and abstract realms. There are, however, plenty of\nreasons (Vallicella 2002, Ch. 2) to reject the view that existence is\na first-level property and the ontological schemes that entail it. One\nintuition that many share is that existence is not one of an\nindividual\u2019s properties, but that in virtue of which it has any\nproperties in the first place: it is more like the unity or cohesion\nof an individual\u2019s properties (Vallicella 2002, Ch. 6).\n\nAnother route to the identity of God with his existence is via the\ndivine necessity. Although it is true to say that a contingent being\nis one that exists in some, but not all, metaphysically possible\nworlds, that is not what makes a contingent being contingent. What\nmakes a contingent being contingent is the real distinction in it\nbetween essence and existence. What makes an absolutely necessary\nbeing necessary, then, is the lack of such a distinction. God, who has\nhis necessity from himself and not from another, is therefore\nidentical to his existence. One can say, if one likes, that God exists\nin all metaphysically possible worlds, but that is true only because\nin God essence and existence are the same. The divine simplicity is\nthe ground of the divine necessity. Given the way our minds work, we\ncannot think of God without distinguishing between essence and\nexistence; but that is our affair and not God\u2019s. In reality, God\nis his existence.\n3.3 The Identity of the Divine Attributes\n\nThe foregoing may explain how it is conceivable without obvious\nincoherence that God and his nature and God and his existence be\nidentical, but how does it answer the second question? How does it\nexplain the conceivability without obvious incoherence of the identity\nof the divine attributes with each other? If each attribute is\nidentical to God, then each attribute is identical to each other by\nthe Transitivity of Identity. For example, if God = omniscience, and\nGod = omnipotence, then omniscience = omnipotence. But how could each\nattribute be identical to God? If we can understand how each attribute\ncan be identical to God, then we can understand how every attribute\ncan be identical to every other one.\n\nWe have already seen how, if we embrace a constituent approach to\nontology, the divine nature can be coherently conceived as identical\nto God. Being immaterial, there is nothing in God to distinguish him\nfrom his nature. So he is identical to his nature. The divine nature\nis, or can be thought of as, a property. So there is at least one\nproperty that is self-instantiating: it has itself as its sole\ninstance, and indeed as its sole possible instance. If this is\ncoherently conceivable, then the same will be true of perfect\nknowledge, perfect power, and so on: if instantiated, these attributes\nare self-instantiated in every possible world and by the same thing in\nevery possible world (Vallicella 1992). Thus not only is the divine\nnature identical to an individual, each divine perfection is identical\nto an individual, namely God, whence it follows that each perfection\nis identical to every other one.\n\nA structurally similar approach is suggested by Christopher Hughes.\nThink of first-level properties as David Lewis (1986, 50 ff.) does: as\nsets of actual and possible individuals. Then the property of being\nred will be the set of all actual and possible red individuals and the\nproperty of being perfectly powerful will be the set consisting of all\nactual and possible perfectly powerful individuals. But there is only\none such individual, God. Only God is perfectly powerful and only God\ncan be perfectly powerful. So perfect power = {God}. As Hughes (1989,\n65) notes, Quine holds that a singleton and its member are identical.\nIf so, then perfect power = {God} = God. It should be added that if we\nhave already abandoned nonconstituent ontology with its rigid\nbifurcation of the concrete and the abstract according to which the\ntwo realms are disjoint, then we no longer have a reason to argue that\na concrete individual and its singleton must be distinct on the ground\nthat the former is concrete while the latter is abstract. Constituent\nontology allows for a sort of \u2018coalescence\u2019 of the\nconcrete and the abstract, the particular and the universal. Indeed,\nsuch a coalescence is what we find in the simple God who is in some\nsense both concrete and abstract in that he is a nature that is its\nown suppositum.\n\nThus there appears to be justification for the move from perfect power\n= {God} to perfect power = God. And similarly for perfect knowledge,\netc. In this way one can render coherent the notion that the\nperfections constitutive of the divine nature are identical with one\nanother. For if each is identical to God, then each is identical to\nevery other one.\n3.4 God and Mann: DDS and Property-Instances\n\nWilliam Mann cites a couple of difficulties that arise if the divine\nattributes are said to be identical to each other. The first is that\nif God = wisdom, and God = life, then wisdom = life. But wisdom and\nlife are not even extensionally equivalent, let alone identical. If\nTom is alive, it doesn\u2019t follow that Tom is wise (Mann 2015,\n23). The second difficulty is that if God is wisdom, and Socrates is\nwise by participating in wisdom, then Socrates is wise by\nparticipating in God. But this smacks of heresy. No creature\nparticipates in God (Mann 2015, 23). The problem arises if the divine\nattributes are thought to be universals.\n\nEnter property instances. It is one thing to say that God is wisdom,\nquite another to say that God is God\u2019s wisdom.\nGod\u2019s wisdom is an example of a property instance. And similarly\nfor the other divine attributes. God is not identical to life; God is\nidentical to his life. Suppose we say that God = God\u2019s\nwisdom, and God = God\u2019s life. It would then follow that\nGod\u2019s wisdom = God\u2019s life, but not that God = wisdom or\nthat wisdom = life. So if we construe identity with properties as\nidentity with property instances, then we can evade both of the above\ndifficulties. Mann\u2019s idea, then, is that the identity claims\nmade within DDS should be taken as Deity-instance identities (e.g.,\nGod is his omniscience) and as instance-instance identities (e.g.,\nGod\u2019s omniscience is God\u2019s omnipotence), but not as\nDeity-property identities (e.g., God is omniscience) or as\nproperty-property identities (e.g., omniscience is omnipotence).\nSupport for Mann\u2019s approach is readily available in the texts of\nthe doctor angelicus (Mann 2015, 24). Aquinas says things\nlike, Deus est sua bonitas, \u201cGod is his\ngoodness.\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is a property instance? If the concrete individual\nSocrates instantiates the abstract universal property wisdom, then two\nfurther putative items come into consideration. One is the\n(Chisholmian-Plantingian as opposed to Bergmannian-Armstrongian) state\nof affairs, Socrates\u2019 being wise. Such items are abstract, i.e.,\nnot in space or time. The other is the property instance, the wisdom\nof Socrates. Mann rightly holds that they are distinct. All abstract\nstates of affairs exist, but only some of them obtain or are actual.\nBy contrast, all property instances are actual: they cannot exist\nwithout being actual. The wisdom of Socrates is a particular, an\nunrepeatable item, just as Socrates is, and the wisdom of Socrates is\nconcrete (in space and/or time) just as Socrates is. If we admit\nproperty instances into our ontology, then the above two difficulties\ncan be circumvented. Or so Mann maintains.\n\nBut then other problems loom. One is this. If the F-ness of God = God,\nif, for example, the wisdom of God = God, then God is a property\ninstance. But God is a person. How could a person be a property\ninstance? From the frying pan into the fire? How could the stupendous\nand super-eminent reality of God be reduced to something as\nontologically flimsy as a property instance? The problem displayed as\nan inconsistent triad: (a) God is a property instance; (b) God is a\nperson; (c) No person is a property instance.\n\nMann solves the triad by denying (c) (2015, 37). Some persons are\nproperty instances. Indeed, Mann argues that every person is a\nproperty instance because everything is a property instance. (2015,\n38) God is a person and therefore a property instance. If you object\nthat persons are concrete while property instances are abstract,\nMann\u2019s response is that both are concrete (2015, 37). To be\nconcrete is to be in space and/or time (2015, 37). Socrates is\nconcrete in this sense, but so is his being sunburned.\n\nIf you object that persons are substances and thus independent items\nwhile property instances are not substances but dependent on\nsubstances, Mann\u2019s response will be that the point holds for\naccidental property instances but not for essential property\ninstances. Socrates may lose his wisdom but he cannot lose his\nhumanity. Now all of God\u2019s properties are essential: God is\nessentially omniscient, omnipotent, etc. So it seems to Mann that\n\u201cthe omniscience of God is not any more dependent on God than\nGod is on the omniscience of God: should either cease to be, the other\nwould also.\u201d (2015, 37) This is scarcely compelling: x can\ndepend on y even if both are necessary beings. Both the set whose sole\nmember is the number 7 and the number 7 itself are necessary beings,\nbut the set depends on its member both for its existence and its\nnecessity, and not vice versa. Closer to home, Aquinas held that some\nnecessary beings have their necessity from another while one has its\nnecessity in itself. I should think that the omniscience of God is\ndependent on God, and not vice versa. Mann\u2019s view, however, is\nnot unreasonable. Intuitions vary.\n\nMann\u2019s argument for the thesis that everything is a property\ninstance involves the notion of a rich property. The rich property of\nan individual x is a conjunctive property the conjuncts of\nwhich are all and only the essential and accidental properties, some\nof them temporally indexed, instantiated by x throughout\nx\u2019s career (2015, 38). Mann tells us that for anything\nwhatsoever there is a corresponding rich property. From this he\nconcludes that \u201ceverything is a property instance of some rich\nproperty or other\u201d (38). It follows that every person is a\nproperty instance. The argument seems to be this: (a) For every\nconcrete individual x, there is a corresponding rich property\nR. Therefore, (b) for every concrete individual x,\nx is a property instance of some rich property or other.\nTherefore, (c) For every concrete individual x, if x\nis a person, then x is a property instance.\n\nVallicella (2016, 379) argues that the move from (a) to (b) smacks of\na non sequitur absent some auxiliary premise. Let it be granted\narguendo that for each concrete individual x there\nis a corresponding rich property R. And let it be granted\nthat there are property instances. So, in addition to Socrates and\nwisdom, there is the wisdom of Socrates. Recall that this property\ninstance is not to be confused with the abstract state of affairs,\nSocrates\u2019 being wise. From what has been granted it follows that\nfor each x there is the rich property instance, the R-ness of\nx. But how is it supposed to follow that everything is a\nproperty instance? Everything instantiates properties, and in this\nsense everything is an instance of properties; but this is not to say\nthat everything is a property instance. Socrates instantiates a rich\nproperty, and so is an instance of a property, but it doesn\u2019t\nfollow that Socrates is a property instance. Something seems to be\nmissing in Mann\u2019s argument.\n\nThere is of course no chance that Mann is confusing being an instance\nof a property with being a property instance. If a\ninstantiates F-ness, then a is an instance of the\nproperty F-ness; but a is not a property instance as\nphilosophers use this phrase: the F-ness of a is a\nproperty instance. So what do we have to add to Mann\u2019s argument\nfor it to generate the conclusion that every concrete individual is a\nproperty instance? How do we validate the inferential move from (a) to\n(b)? Let \u2018Rs\u2019 stand for\nSocrates\u2019 rich property. We have to add the claim that there is\nnothing one could point to that could distinguish Socrates from the\nproperty instance generated when Socrates instantiates\nRs. Rich property instances are a special case of\nproperty instances. Socrates cannot be identical to his wisdom because\nhe can exist even if his wisdom does not exist. And he cannot be\nidentical to his humanity because there is more to Socrates that his\nhumanity, even though he cannot exist without it. But since\nSocrates\u2019 rich property instance includes all his property\ninstances, why can\u2019t Socrates be identical to this rich property\ninstance? And so Mann\u2019s thought seems to be that there is\nnothing that could distinguish Socrates from his rich property\ninstance. So they are identical. And likewise for every other\nindividual. But it is arguable that it is a mistake to hold that every\nperson is a property instance. Here (Vallicella 2016 379\u2013380) is\none argument.\n\nRich Properties and Haecceity Properties. Socrates can exist\nwithout his rich property; ergo, he can exist without his rich\nproperty instance; ergo, Socrates cannot be a rich property instance\nor any property instance. The truth of the initial premise is fallout\nfrom the definition of \u2018rich property.\u2019 The R of\nx is a conjunctive property each conjunct of which is a\nproperty of x. Thus Socrates\u2019 rich property includes\n(has as a conjunct) the property of being married to Xanthippe. But\nSocrates might not have had that property, whence it follows that he\nmight not have had R. (If R has C as a\nconjunct, then necessarily R has C as a conjunct,\nwhich implies that R cannot be what it is without having\nexactly the conjuncts it in fact has. An analog of mereological\nessentialism holds for conjunctive properties.) And because Socrates\nmight not have had R, he might not have had the property\ninstance of R. So Socrates cannot be identical to this\nproperty instance. What Mann needs is not a rich property, but an\nhaecceity property: one that individuates Socrates across every\npossible world in which he exists. His rich property, by contrast,\nindividuates him in only the actual world. In different worlds,\nSocrates has different rich properties. And in different worlds,\nSocrates has different rich property instances. It follows that\nSocrates cannot be identical to, or even necessarily equivalent to,\nany rich property instance. An haecceity property, however, is a\nproperty Socrates has in every world in which he exists, and which he\nalone has in every world in which he exists. Now if there are such\nhaecceity properties as identity-with-Socrates, then perhaps we can\nsay that Socrates is identical to a property instance, namely, the\nidentity-with-Socrates of Socrates. Unfortunately, there are powerful\narguments for rejecting haecceity properties (Vallicella 2002,\n99\u2013104). So we ought to conclude that concrete individuals\ncannot be identified with property instances, whence follows the\nperhaps obvious proposition that no person is a property instance, not\nGod, not me, not Socrates.\n3.5 God and McCann: DDS and Concrete States of Affairs\n\nTo conceptualize a simple God it seems we must assign him to some\nfamiliar category or other. But how is this possible if, as DDS\nimplies, God is utterly sui generis and unique in his very\nmode of uniqueness? It might not be possible at all, in which case\nsilence might be the most appropriate response. But let\u2019s not\ngive up just yet. Vallicella (1992) suggests that God is assimilable\nto a self-exemplifying property, a Platonic Form. Hughes goes\nnominalist with his idea that God is something like a singleton set.\nMann assimilates God to a property instance or trope. Hugh McCann,\nrejecting Mann\u2019s view, proposes that we think of God as a\nconcrete state of affairs. Such are to be distinguished from abstract\nstates of affairs. Contrast Booth\u2019s assassinating\nLincoln with Booth assassinating Lincoln. Both are\nstates of affairs, but only the former is concrete in the sense of\ncausally active/passive. Whereas the former is an act (act-token), the\nlatter is an act-type. The former was causally efficacious; the latter\nis disbarred from causal efficacy by its ontological category.\nMcCann\u2019s proposal, then, is that God be thought of as a concrete\nstate of affairs along the lines of Michaelangelo\u2019s creating\nof the Sistine Chapel\u2019s ceiling.\n\nThus is concretion secured, but whither simplicity? A concrete state\nof affairs such as Socrates\u2019 being pale is a complex both the\nsubject and the property constituent of which are necessary for its\nidentity. Property instance or tropes, by contrast, are simples: the\npaleness trope in Socrates, though it cannot \u2018migrate\u2019 to\nPlato, does not have Socrates as a constituent and so is not tied to\nthe philosopher for its identity. Now McCann is well aware that the\nontological complexity of concrete states of affairs does not comport\nwell with divine simplicity. But he thinks it is the best we can\ndo.\n\nAlthough McCann doesn\u2019t say it, it seems to follow from his\nwhole approach that God cannot be a member of any extant ontological\ncategory: he cannot be a universal or a set or a trope \u2026 or a\nconcrete state of affairs. Indeed, if he is absolutely sovereign, then\nGod must somehow be the creative source of the ontological categories\nthemselves, how many they are and what they are, and not merely the\nsource of the natures (essences) of the members of categories. God\nmust transcend all categories. Taken to the limit, absolute\nsovereignty would seem to imply absolute transcendence\u2014 and\nabsolute ineffability. Clearly, this is what the simplicity doctrine\nculminates in and is meant to preserve. So there is a tension here if\nnot a contradiction: it cannot be true both that God is beyond all\nontological categories and is a member of the category of concrete\nstates of affairs. But if we are to have any conception of God at all,\nwe must force him into some extant category or other, and for McCann\nthe category of concrete state of affairs is the best we can do. One\nwalks a tightrope when one attempts to avoid negative theology with\nits \u201cnothing can be said positively about God.\u201d Citing\nvarious texts of Aquinas, Eleonore Stump (2016, 195\u2013198) shows\nthat radical agnosticism about the divine nature is unwarranted. To\nknow what God is not, one must have some knowledge of what God is. The\nclaim that God is not a body, for example, rests on such affirmations\nas that God is the prime mover and is purely actual.\n4. Preserving Divine Transcendence While Avoiding Negative Theology\n\nSo far we have explored how God can be (i) identical to his nature,\n(ii) identical to his existence, and (iii) such that his\nomni-attributes are identical to one another. But a very serious\nproblem remains, a problem that arises when we consider properties in\nsome sense shared by God and creatures. It is obvious that the divine\nperfections cannot be shared with creatures: only God is perfectly\npowerful, wise, good, and so on. Socrates is at best imperfectly\npowerful, wise, good, and so on. But there must be some properties\nthat God and creatures share if God is not to be a wholly other than\ncreatures and out of all relation to them. These shared properties,\nhowever, pose a threat to DDS as we shall see in a moment. The problem\nin a nutshell is to reconcile the divine transcendence, of which DDS\nis an expression, with the need for some commensurability between God\nand creatures. The problem, in other words, is to find a way of\npreserving transcendence while avoiding a self-vitiating negative\ntheology according to which nothing can be positively affirmed of God,\nnot even that he exists.\n\nGod is powerful, but so is Socrates. The use of \u2018powerful\u2019\nin \u2018God is powerful\u2019 and \u2018Socrates is\npowerful\u2019 is not equivocal. That God is perfectly powerful while\nSocrates is imperfectly powerful does not alter the fact that both are\npowerful. Whether a thing is perfectly powerful or imperfectly\npowerful, it is powerful. There is a difference in degree of power,\nbut the difference in degree seems to presuppose (and thus entail) a\nsameness in respect of being powerful. Now if God and Socrates are\nboth powerful, then God has a property with which he is not identical,\nnamely, the property of being powerful, and this contradicts DDS. For\nif God is identical with the property of being powerful, then he\ncannot share this property with Socrates. The argument, then, is\nthis:\n\nNecessarily, for any x, if x is perfectly\n(maximally) F, then x is F.\n\n\nFrom (1) together with the premise that God is perfectly powerful, it\nfollows that\n\nGod is powerful.\n\n\nBut among creatures we also find agents of varying degrees of power,\nso it is also true that\n\nSocrates is powerful.\n\n\nIt follows from (2) and (3) that\n\nThere are properties that God and creatures share.\n\n\nIf x and y share a property P, then\nP is distinct from both x and y.\nTherefore,\n\nThere are properties of God with which God is not identical, which\nimplies that DDS is false.\n\n4.1 Proposal One: Sameness of Predicate No Guarantee of Sameness of Property\n\nGraham Oppy (2003) suggests a way to defeat the foregoing argument.\nOppy (in effect) rejects the inference from (2) and (3) to (4). Given\nthe truth of \u2018God is powerful\u2019 and \u2018Socrates is\npowerful,\u2019 it does not follow that there is a property expressed\nby the predicate \u2018powerful\u2019 that is shared by God and\nSocrates. On Oppy\u2019s approach, both sentences are true, and the\npredicate \u2018powerful\u2019 has the same sense in both sentences.\nThere is no equivocation and no analogy either. It is just that there\nis no one property that is expressed by the predicate in its two\noccurrences. If this right, then there is no warrant for (4) and the\nabove argument against DDS collapses.\n\nOppy is not denying that many predicates express properties; he is\ndenying that all do. Taking a page from David Armstrong (1978), he is\nsaying that predicates and their senses provide no sure guidance as to\nwhat properties (Armstrongian immanent universals) the world contains.\nIt follows that the ontological structure of the truth-maker of a true\nsentence cannot be read off from the syntactic structure of the\nsentence of which it is the truth-maker. Therefore, the fact that our\ntwo sentences (3) and (4) have the form a is F does not\nwarrant the conclusion that the respective truth-makers have the\nstructure: particular-exemplifying-same universal. Oppy writes:\n\nThat two sentences of the form \u2018a is red\u2019 and\n\u2018b is red\u2019 are both true does not entail that\nthere is some universal that plays a role in making both of these\nsentences true; it is possible that none of the universals that play a\nrole in making true the sentence \u2018a is red\u2019 have\nany role in making true the sentence \u2018b is red.\u2019\n(This point is supported by those lines of thought which suggest that,\nfrom a scientific standpoint, \u2018redness\u2019 constitutes a\nhighly gerrymandered and heterogeneous \u2018kind.\u2019) (Oppy\n2003, p. 15)\n\n\nThe idea is essentially this. Suppose that something is an H\nif and only if it is either an F or a G. One can\neasily see that if a is H and b is\nH, it does not follow that there is some one property that\nthey share. For it might be that a is H in virtue of\na\u2019s exemplifying F-ness and b is\nH in virtue of b\u2019s exemplifying\nG-ness. Applied to Socrates and the simple God: Socrates is\npowerful in virtue of exemplifying P1 while God is\npowerful in virtue of exemplifying P2. Thus there\nis no one property, the property of being powerful, that both\nexemplify. So (4) above is false, and the argument against DDS\ncollapses. Since a full defense of Oppy\u2019s defense of DDS is\nbeyond the scope of the present entry, we shall focus on a second way\nof defusing the objection.\n4.2 Proposal Two: \u2018Perfect\u2019 as an Alienans Adjective\n\nThe above argument against DDS requires the assumption that if\nx is perfectly F, then x is F.\nThis is highly plausible but not quite obvious, since as Barry Miller\n(1996, Ch. 5) argues, \u2018perfect\u2019 might be an\nalienans adjective. An alienans adjective is one\nthat shifts, alters, alienates, the sense of the noun that it\nmodifies. Thus \u2018decoy\u2019 in \u2018decoy duck\u2019 is an\nalienans adjective: from the fact that a thing is a decoy\nduck one cannot infer that it is a duck in the way in which one can\ninfer from the fact that a thing is a male duck that it is a duck. So\nif \u2018perfectly\u2019 in \u2018perfectly powerful\u2019 is an\nalienans adjective, then God can be perfectly powerful\nwithout being powerful, and the above objection to DDS collapses.\n\nAt first glance, this may appear to be a senseless suggestion. Power\nis an attribute that admits of degrees. Perfect power is therefore\nquite naturally viewed as the maximal degree of power. So viewed,\nperfect power is generically identical with any submaximal degree of\npower. According to Miller, however, there is an important distinction\nbetween a limit simpliciter and a limit case. A limit simpliciter\ndiffers merely in degree from that of which it is the limit\nsimpliciter, whereas a limit case differs absolutely from that of\nwhich it is the limit case. Thus the limit simpliciter of an\nF is an F, while the limit case of an F is\nnot an F. What Miller argues is that the divine perfections\nare limit cases, not limits simpliciter, of such properties as power\nand knowledge. As such, they have nothing generically in common with\nthe corresponding attributes in creatures.\n\nTo appreciate the limit simpliciter/limit case distinction, consider\nthe speed of moving bodies. It has an upper limit, the speed of light.\nThis is a limit simpliciter. But the lower limit, namely the speed 0\nkm/sec, is a limit case and not a limit simpliciter. Whereas the upper\nlimit simpliciter is a speed, the lower limit case is not a speed. A\nparticle moving at 0 km/sec is not moving. For a second example,\nconsider the series: 3-place predicable, 2-place predicable, 1-place\npredicable. Since a predicable (e.g., \u201c___ is wise\u201d) must\nhave at least one place to be a predicable, a 1-place predicable is a\nlimit simpliciter of the ordered series of predicables.\nAlthough talk of zero-place predicables comes naturally, as when we\nspeak of a proposition as a zero-place predicable, a zero-place\npredicable is no more a predicable than negative growth is growth.\n\u201cZero-place\u201d is an alienans adjective like\n\u201cnegative\u201d in \u201cnegative growth.\u201d So a\nzero-place predicable is not a limit simpliciter of the series in\nquestion, but a limit case of this series: it is not a member\nof the series of which it is the limit case. It nevertheless stands in\nsome relation to the members of the series inasmuch as they and the\nway they are ordered point to the limit case (Miller 1996, p.\n8).\n\nThe idea, then, is that God\u2019s power is not the maximum, or limit\nsimpliciter, of an ordered series of instances of power, but the limit\ncase of power. This implies that God\u2019s power is not an\ninstance of power any more than a zero-place predicable is a\npredicable. No doubt this will surprise the perfect-being theologians,\nbut, in mitigation, it can be said that God\u2019s power, though not\nan instance of power, is that to which the ordered series of\npower-instances points, and is therefore something to which\nthe members of that series stand in a definite relation.\n\nMiller\u2019s approach allows us to reject the premise of the above\nargument. The premise stated in effect that anything that is perfectly\npowerful is powerful. But if Miller is right, and God\u2019s power is\nnot the limit simpliciter of an ordered series of instances of power,\nand thus itself an instance of power, but is instead a limit\ncase of power, then what is perfectly powerful need not be an\ninstance of power.\n4.3 Dolezal\u2019s Mysterian Move\n\nGod is the absolute. An absolute cannot lack anything nor does it have\nany need to develop itself: it is, eternally, all that it can be. This\nimplies that there is no act-potency distinction in God, no unrealized\npowers or potentialities. In the classical phrase, God is actus\npurus, pure act, wholly actual. James Dolezal puts it very well\nwhen he writes, \u201cThe consideration of God as ipsum esse\nsubsistens and actus purus is crucial for any confession\nof God\u2019s absolute existence\u201d (Dolezal 2011, 214).\n\nBut to uphold the divine absoluteness, it is also necessary that God\nbe libertarianly free in his production of creatures. He must be free\neither to create or not to create. For suppose that the divine nature\nis such that God must create. Then God would depend on the created\nworld to be himself and to be fully actual. He would need what is\nother than himself to be himself. This entanglement with the relative\nwould compromise the divine absoluteness. God would need the world as\nmuch as the world needs God. Each would require the other to be what\nit is. But then God would not be absolute (Dolezal, 210) Therefore,\nGod must be free to either create or not create\n\nSo God must be both simple and free to be absolute. But it is very\ndifficult to understand how a simple being could be free in the\nunconditional \u2018could have done otherwise\u2019 sense. If God is\nsimple, then he is pure act, as was explained at the beginning of this\nentry. It follows that God is devoid of unrealized powers,\npotentialities, or de re possibilities. To act freely,\nhowever is to act in such a way that one (unconditionally) could have\ndone otherwise, which implies unrealized possibilities of divine\naction. Now Dolezal\u2019s view is that it is not only difficult to\nreconcile simplicity and (libertarian) freedom, but impossible for us,\nat least in our present state. \u201cThough we discover strong\nreasons for confessing both simplicity and freedom in God, we cannot\nform an isomorphically adequate notion of how this is the case\u201d\n(210). In footnote 55 on the same page, Dolezal brings up\nwave-particle duality: light behaves both like a particle and like a\nwave. We have good reason to believe that it is both despite the\ndifficulty or impossibility of understanding how it could be both. On\nthe basis of the quotation and the footnote it seems fair to Dolezal\nto pin the label \u2018mysterian\u2019 on him, at least with respect\nto the simplicity-freedom problem which is only one sub-problem within\nthe divine simplicity constellation of problems. God is both simple\nand free, and he must be both to be God; it is a mystery, however, how\nhe could be both.\n\nIf we have good reason to believe that p is true, and good\nreason to believe that q is true, then we have good reason to\nbelieve that p and q are logically consistent (with\neach other) despite an absence of understanding as to how\nthey could be mutually consistent. What is actual is possible whether\nor not one can render intelligible how it is possible. For example,\nmotion is actual, hence possible, despite one\u2019s inability in the\nteeth of Zenonian considerations to understand how it is possible.\nMany similar examples could be given.\n\nAnd so a mysterian move suggests itself: We are justified in\nmaintaining both that God is simple and that God is free despite the\nfact that after protracted effort we cannot make logical sense of this\nconjunction. If we have good arguments for both limbs of what appears\nto be a logically contradictory dyad, it could be that the\ncontradiction is merely apparent. The fact that the conjunction\n\u2014 God is simple and God is free \u2014 appears to us, and\nperhaps even necessarily appears to us, to be or rather entail an\nexplicit logical contradiction is not a compelling reason to reject\nthe conjunction. It is a reason, perhaps even a good reason, but not a\nrationally compelling one. For it may be that our cognitive\narchitecture saddles us with irremediable cognitive limitations that\nmake it impossible for us to understand how God could be both simple\nand libertarianly free. The mysterian is not a dialetheist: the\nmysterian does not claim that there are true contradictions. Like the\nrest of us, the mysterian eschews them like the plague. The mysterian\npoint is rather that a proposition\u2019s non-episodic and chronic\nseeming to be a contradiction does not suffice for its rejection. For\nit may well be that certain truths are inaccessible to us due to our\nmental limitations and defects, and that among these truths are some\nthat appear to us only in the guise of contradictions, and must so\nappear in this life. The religious mysterian can bolster the point by\nreferencing the Fall. Sin, after all, may be expected to have noetic\nconsequences. Of course, Dolezal\u2019s mysterian move cannot be\nreasonably made unless the extant attempts to reconcile simplicity and\nfreedom are failures. That they are failures is not difficult to\nbelieve. So mysterianism is up and running despite its own problems.\nWhat might these be?\n\nFirst, if a (conjunctive) proposition\u2019s seeming, after careful\nand repeated scrutiny, to be or entail an explicit logical\ncontradiction is not sufficient, or at least good enough, evidence of\nits being a contradiction, what would be? To put it another way,\none\u2019s inability to explain how it could be true both that\np and that q does seem to be pretty good\n(non-demonstrative) evidence that p and q are not\nboth true. Now it was noted above that the actual is possible whether\nor not one can explain how it is possible. Granted, but if one cannot\nexplain the \u2018how,\u2019 doubt is cast on the actuality. The\ntables can be turned. How adjudicate between these opposing lines of\nargument: A: Because X is actual, X is possible,\nwhether or not anyone can explain how it is possible! B: Because no\none can explain how it is possible, it is not possible, and therefore\nnot actual!\n\nSecond, if all extant attempts to reconcile simplicity and freedom\nfail, it does not follow that there isn\u2019t a solution right over\nthe horizon. How can a mysterian rule out the possibility of a future\nsolution? The mysterian seems committed to saying that it is\nimpossible (at least in this life) that there be a solution. How can\nhe be sure of this?\n\nThird, if a proposition appears under careful scrutiny to be or entail\na contradiction, then is there even a proposition before the mind? If\nyou require for x\u2019s salvation that x believe\nthat God is one and God is three, what exactly are you demanding that\nx believe? Before x can affirm a proposition as true\nx must understand it, but how can x affirm as true a\nproposition that appears necessarily false? Such a\n\u2018proposition\u2019 is arguably not a proposition at all.\nGod is simple but free appears to be in like case. As a\nmatter of pure logic, there are of course necessarily false\npropositions: take the members of a contradictory pair of propositions\nand conjoin them, e.g., snow is white & snow is not\nwhite. This necessarily false proposition is arguably not a\npossible object of belief because of our charitable tendency to\nre-interpret blatant contradictions in some innocuous way. When our\nhermeneutical charity is thwarted, however, we suspend belief, not in\na proposition, but in a putative proposition\u2019s being a\nproposition, or in a verbal formula\u2019s expressing a\nproposition.\n4.4 Stump\u2019s Quantum Metaphysics\n\nLike Dolezal, Eleonore Stump thinks of God as self-subsistent Being\n(esse). If God is absolutely simple, and not just simple in\nthe uncontroversial sense of lacking material parts, then God must be\nself-subsistent Being. God is at once both Being and something that\nis. He has to be both. If he were Being (esse) but not a\nbeing (id quod est), he could not enter into causal\nrelations. He could not do anything such as create the world,\nintervene in its operations, or interact with human persons. Such a\nGod would be \u201creligiously pernicious\u201d (Stump 2016, 199).\nIndeed, if God were Being but not a being, then one could not sensibly\nmaintain that God exists. For if Being is other than every being, then\nBeing is not. (It is instructive to note that Martin Heidegger, the\nfamous critic of onto-theology, who holds to the \u201contological\ndifference\u201d of Being (Sein) from every being\n(Seiendes) ends up assimilating Being to Nothing\n(Nichts).) On the other hand, if God were a being among\nbeings who merely has Being but is not (identically) Being, then he\nwould not be absolutely transcendent, worthy of worship, or ineffable.\nSuch a God would be \u201ccomfortingly familiar\u201d but\n\u201cdiscomfitingly anthropomorphic\u201d (Miller 1996, 3). It is\nnot clear that DDS is susceptible of a satisfactory articulation\nacceptable to most theists. There is no reason to be sanguine. But if\nsuch could be achieved then we would have a via media between\nthe Scylla of negative theology according to which nothing can be\ntruly said or known about God and the Charybdis of an anthropomorphic\ntheology according to which \u201c\u2026 God\u2019s properties are\nmerely human ones, albeit extended to the maximum degree\npossible\u201d (Miller, 1996, 3).\n\nThe problem, of course, is to explain how God can be both Being\n(esse) and something that is (ens). This is\nunintelligible to the discursive intellect. Either Being is other than\nbeings or it is not. If Being is other than beings, then Being cannot\nitself be. That would imply that God, who must be Being itself to be\nabsolute, cannot be. If, on the other hand, Being just is beings taken\ncollectively, then God could only be a being among beings and not the\nabsolute reality. To the discursive intellect the notion of\nself-subsistent Being is contradictory. For the idea here is that\nBeing itself is a being, a very special being no doubt, but\nnonetheless a being, something that is. One response to the\ncontradiction is simply to deny divine simplicity. That is a\nreasonable response, no doubt. But might it not also be reasonable to\nadmit that there are things that human reason cannot understand, and\nthat one of these things is the divine nature? \u201cHuman reason can\nsee that human reason cannot comprehend the quid est of\nGod.\u201d (Stump 2016, 205)\n\nOn one reading of Stump, she, like Dolezal, makes a mysterian move,\nand she, like Dolezal (2011, 210, fn 55), invokes wave-particle\nduality. We cannot understand how light can be both a wave phenomenon\nand also particulate in nature, and yet it is both:\n\nWhat kind of thing is it which has to be understood both as a wave and\nas a particle? We do not know. That is, we do not know the quid\nest of light. [\u2026] Analogously, we can ask: What kind of\nthing is it which can be both esse and id quod est?\nWe do not know. The idea of simplicity is that at the ultimate\nmetaphysical foundation of reality is something that has to\nbe understood as esse \u2014but also as id quod\nest. We do not know what this kind of thing is either. (Stump\n2016, 202)\n\n4.5 Hasker contra Dolezal and Stump\n\nIf the defender of DDS is driven to mysterianism, many will consider\nthis a desperate jump from the frying pan into the fire. Dolezal, for\nexample, holds that God must be both simple and libertarianly free to\nbe absolute despite the apparent contradiction. How God can be both\nsimple and free must remain a mystery. William Hasker balks:\n\u201cThis won\u2019t do, of course\u201d (2016, 19). His \u201cof\ncourse\u201d is of course a bit of bluster, but one feels his pain.\n\u201cThe argument Dolezal has given quite straightforwardly entails\nthat the doctrine of divine simplicity is false \u2026\u201d (2016,\n19). This is not an unreasonable thing to say, but is it compelling?\nDoes it force a rational person to abandon DDS? Is it so compelling\nthat DDS can be dismissed as a mistake, a correctable error\nin reasoning that one falls into due, perhaps, to inattention to\ncertain obvious truths? Not quite.\n\nHasker takes the apparent contradiction to be real. But can he exclude\nthe possibility that the contradiction is merely apparent? His view\ncomports well with the notion that God is a being among beings. But\nfor those who hold that the divine transcendence requires that God\ntranscend beings in his mode of existence, his mode of\nproperty-possession, his mode of necessity, and his mode of\nuniqueness, it may seem more likely that the apparent contradictions\nthat arise when we think about God reflect our structural inability to\nthink of him as anything other than a very special being among\nbeings.\n\nFor Stump, God is esse and God is also id quod est.\nThese claims, though apparently contradictory, must both be affirmed.\nThe apparent contradiction arises because of a \u201cdeficiency in\nour mode of speaking\u201d (Stump 2016, 207). She presumably means\nthat this deficiency is in this life irremediable and ineluctable. In\nreality, however, there is no contradiction; the laws of logic apply\nto God, \u201cand not just anything can be correctly affirmed of\nGod\u201d (2016, 207).\n\nHasker is unimpressed:\n\n\u2026 we do not, strictly speaking, have here a coherent view of\nGod\u2019s nature \u2026 . What we have, rather, is a set of\nmutually incompatible propositions, each of which has something to be\nsaid in its favor, but at least one of which must be false. (Hasker\n2016, 23, fn 52)\n\n\nStump could agree with Hasker that she does not present us with\n\u201ca coherent view of God\u2019s nature,\u201d but then that is\nprecisely what her position implies cannot be had. Our mode of\nspeaking about God is necessarily defective and inaccurate. If we\ncould speak accurately, then \u2026\n\n\u2026 we would know the true nature of God. We would know the\nquid est of God. But this is precisely what we do not know.\nSo although, on Aquinas\u2019s view, we can have considerable\npositive knowledge of God, the modes of speaking about God retain\ntheir inaccuracy in anything having to do with the quiddity of God.\n(Stump 2016, 207)\n\n\nThe issue that divides Hasker and Stump and the parties they represent\nis perhaps impossible to resolve. Hasker demands a \u201ccoherent\nview of God\u2019s nature,\u201d one that satisfies and can be\nseen to satisfy the exigencies of the discursive intellect.\nHasker demands that God fit within the discursive framework, which\nimplies that he have properties the way creatures do, exist the way\ncreatures do, and so on. Stump could reasonably claim that Hasker is\nmaking an inappropriate demand, one that does not respect the divine\ntranscendence.\n5. The Truthmaker Defense\n\nProponents of DDS affirm such sentences as \u2018God is his\nomniscience\u2019 and\u2018God is his omnipotence.\u2019 If the\nsingular terms \u2018his omniscience\u2019 and \u2018his\nomnipotence\u2019 in such sentences are taken to refer to properties,\nthen such sentences assert the identity of God and a property, an\nexemplifiable entity. This is unacceptable for the reasons rehearsed\nin section 2 above. Briefly, God is an individual and not a property.\nIf, however, the singular terms in question could be taken to refer to\nindividuals, then this particular objection to the coherence of DDS\nwould collapse. Clearly, if \u2018God\u2019 and \u2018his\nomniscience\u2019 both refer to an individual, God, then the\ncoherence of \u2018God is his omniscience\u2019 will be beyond\nquestion.\n\nEnter the truthmaker defense. The truthmaker defense hinges on a\ntheory of predication that Bergmann and Brower (2006) put as\nfollows:\n\nP*: The truth of all true predications, or at least of all\ntrue predications of the form \u2018a is F,\u2019\nis to be explained in terms of truthmakers.\n\n\nP* is to be understood by contrast to a theory of predication\naccording to which every true predication of the form\n\u2018a is F\u2019 is to be explained in terms of\nan individual\u2019s exemplifying of a property. Now consider the\nessential predication, \u2018God is omniscient.\u2019 Given that a\ntruthmaker of a truth t is an entity whose existence broadly\nlogically necessitates the truth of t, God himself is\nplausibly viewed as the truthmaker of \u2018God is omniscient\u2019\nand like essential predications. For in every possible world in which\nGod exists, these essential predications (or the propositions they\nexpress) are true. In the case of essential as opposed to accidental\npredications, truthmakers need not be taken to be concrete states of\naffairs, and so need not be taken as involving exemplifiable entities.\nSocrates himself is not plausibly taken to be the truthmaker of the\naccidental \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019 (or the proposition it\nexpresses) because there are possible worlds in which Socrates exists\nbut the predication is not true; Socrates is, however, plausibly taken\nto be the truthmaker of the essential \u2018Socrates is\nhuman.\u2019\n\nNow \u2018God\u2019s omniscience\u2019 and \u2018Socrates\u2019\nhumanity\u2019 are abstract nominalizations of \u2018God is\nomniscient\u2019 and \u2018Socrates is human,\u2019 respectively.\nSo given that God and Socrates are the truthmakers of the respective\nessential predications, the nominalizations can be taken to refer, not\nto properties, but to these very same truthmakers. Accordingly, to say\nthat God is identical to his omniscience is just to say that God is\nidentical to the truthmaker of \u2018God is omniscient.\u2019 And\nthat amounts to saying that God is identical to God. In this way one\navoids the absurdity of saying that God is identical to a property.\nWhat God is identical to is not the property of omniscience but the\nreferent of \u2018God\u2019s omniscience,\u2019 which turns out to\nbe God himself. And similarly for the rest of God\u2019s intrinsic\nand essential attributes.\n6. Is Divine Simplicity Compatible with Creaturely Freedom and God\u2019s Contingent Knowledge?\n\nSuppose a creaturely agent freely performs an action A. He\nfiles his tax return, say, by the April 15th deadline. Suppose that\nthe freedom involved is not the compatibilist \u201cfreedom of the\nturnspit\u201d (to borrow Kant\u2019s phrase) but the robust freedom\nthat implies both that the agent is the unsourced source of the action\nand that the agent could have done otherwise. The performance of\nA makes true a number of contingent propositions, all of them\nknown by God in his omniscience. Now if subject S knows that\nproposition p, and p is contingent, then it would\nseem that S\u2019s knowing that p is or involves an\naccidental (as opposed to essential) intrinsic state of\nS. If God is omniscient, then he knows every (non-indexical)\ntruth, including every contingent truth. It seems to follow that God\nhas at least as many accidental intrinsic states as there are\ncontingent truths. But this contradicts DDS according to which there\nis nothing intrinsic to God that is distinct from God.\n\nConsider the mental state God is in when he knows that Tom freely\nfiles his tax return on April 14th, 2014. This divine mental state is\nan intrinsic state God is in contingently. If God were identical to\nthis state, then he could not be a se. For if God were\nidentical to the state, then God would be dependent on something\n\u2013 Tom\u2019s libertarianly free action \u2013 that is external\nto God and beyond his control. Now anything that compromises the\ndivine aseity will compromise the divine simplicity, the latter being\nan entailment of the former. So it seems that an omniscient God cannot\nbe simple if there are free creaturely agents and God knows what they\ndo and leave undone. There is also the problem that if the divine\nmental state in question were identical to God, then the truth God\nknows when he knows that Tom files on April 14th would be\nnecessarily true.\n\nThe problem is expressible as an aporetic pentad:\n\nEvery free agent is a libertarianly-free (L-free)\nagent.\nGod is ontologically simple (where simplicity is an entailment of\naseity and vice versa): there is nothing intrinsic to God that is\ndistinct from God.\nThere are contingent items of divine all-knowledge that do not\n(wholly) depend on divine creation, but do (partially) depend on\ncreaturely freedom.\nNecessarily, if God knows some truth t, then (i) there an\nitem intrinsic to God such as a mental act or a belief state (ii)\nwhereby God knows t.\nGod exists necessarily.\n\n\nEach limb of the above pentad has a strong, though not irresistible,\nclaim on a classical theist\u2019s acceptance. As for (1), if God is\nL-free, as he must be on classical theism, then it is\nreasonable to maintain that every free agent is L-free. For\nif \u2018could have done otherwise\u2019 is an essential ingredient\nin the analysis of \u2018Agent A freely performs action\nX,\u2019 then it is highly plausible to maintain that this\nis so whether the agent is God or Socrates. Otherwise,\n\u2018free\u2019 will means something different in the two cases.\nFurthermore, if man is made in the image and likeness of God, then it\nis surely arguable if not obvious that part of what this means is that\nman is a spiritual being who is libertarianly free just as God is. If\na man is a deterministic system, then one wonders in what sense man is\nin the image of God.\n\nAs for (2), some reasons were given earlier for thinking that a theism\nthat understands itself must uphold God\u2019s ontological simplicity\ninasmuch as it is implied by the divine aseity. An example of (3) is\nOswald\u2019s shooting of Kennedy. The act was freely performed by\nOswald, and the proposition that records it is a contingent truth\nknown by God in his omniscience.\n\nThe plausibility of (4) may be appreciated as follows. Whatever else\nknowledge is, it is plausibly regarded as a species of true belief. A\nbelief is an intrinsic state of a subject. Moreover, to unpack the\nsecond clause of (3), beliefs are individuated by their contents:\nbeliefs or believings with different contents are different beliefs.\nIt cannot be that one and the same act of believing has different\ncontents at different times or in different possible worlds.\n\n(5), if not obvious on its own, could be taken as an entailment of\n(2). If in God essence and existence are one, then God cannot not\nexist.\n\nBut although each limb of the pentad is plausibly maintained and is\ntypically maintained by theists who uphold DDS, they cannot all be\ntrue. Any four limbs, taken together, entail the negation of the\nremaining one.\n\nTo illustrate, let us consider how the limbs of the pentad, excepting\n(2), entail the negation of (2). Being omniscient, God knows that\nOswald freely chose to kill Kennedy. But Oswald\u2019s\nL-freedom precludes us from saying that God\u2019s knowledge\nof this contingent fact depends solely on the divine will. For it also\ndepends on Oswald\u2019s L-free authorship of his evil deed,\nan authorship that God cannot prevent or override once he has created\nL-free agents. But this is inconsistent with the divine aseity. For to\nsay that God is a se is to say that God is not dependent on\nanything distinct from himself for his existence or intrinsic\nproperties or states. But, by (4), God is in the state of knowing that\nOswald freely chose to kill Kennedy, and his being in this state\ndepends on something outside of God\u2019s control, namely,\nOswald\u2019s L-free choice. In this way the divine aseity\nis compromised, and with it the divine simplicity.\n\nIt seems, then, that our aporetic pentad is an inconsistent pentad.\nThe defender of DDS cannot deny either the divine simplicity or the\ndivine necessity, which is an entailment of simplicity. But an\nupholder of the divine simplicity has the option of denying (1) and\nmaintaining that, while God is L-free, creaturely agents are\nfree only in a compatibilist sense (\u2018C-free\u2019). If\ncreaturely agents are C-free, but not L-free, then\nOswald could not have done otherwise, and it is possible for the\nupholder of divine simplicity to say that that Oswald\u2019s\nC-free choice is no more a threat to the divine aseity than\nthe fact that God knows the contingent truth that creaturely agents\nexist. The latter is not a threat to the divine aseity because the\nexistence of creaturely agents derives from God in a way that\nOswald\u2019s L-free choice does not derive from God.\n\nA second and perhaps better response would be to reject (4) in one of\nthe ways canvassed by W. M. Grant (2012). Here are two ways that\nappear promising. On what Grant calls the Belief Model, God\u2019s\nknowledge is a species of true belief, but God\u2019s beliefs are not\nintrinsic states of God. They are not mental acts or episodes. Beliefs\nare relational. To have a belief is to be related to a proposition,\nwhere propositions are not contents of belief states, but abstract\nentities that exist independently of the subjects who believe them.\nFor God to believe that Oswald killed Kennedy is for God to stand in a\nrelation to a proposition without it being the case that there is\nanything intrinsic to God that grounds his standing in the belief\nrelation to the Oswald proposition as opposed to any other\nproposition. Believing, at least in the case of God, is an external\nrelation, not an internal relation grounded in an intrinsic feature of\nthe believer. Various objections can be brought against this Belief\nModel of divine cognition, but if they can be turned aside, then (4)\nfalls and the pentad is solved.\n\nA second way to reject (4) is by adopting what Grant calls an\nImmediate Cognition Model of divine knowing. Accordingly, God\u2019s\nknowledge is not mediated by propositions or anything else, but is\ndirectly of contingent realities. God\u2019s knowledge of Socrates\nhas as an essential constituent Socrates himself, warts and all. On\nthis externalist model, as on the Belief Model, there nothing internal\nto God and intrinsic to him in virtue of which he possesses contingent\nknowledge, and thus nothing contingent in him to compromise his\nsimplicity.\n\nOne ought to ask, however, whether either model preserves the divine\naseity which is a main motive for the divine simplicity (Brower 2009).\nIf the simple God\u2019s knowing of Socrates includes the man himself\nin his bodily reality, this would seem to make God dependent on\nsomething other than himself. Brower thinks the problem can be defused\nby observing that God is the cause of the contingent entities on which\nhis contingent knowledge depends. Grant (2012, 267), however, thinks\nthat neither externalist model poses a problem for aseity whether or\nnot God causes the contingent objects he knows. If God exists from\nhimself, then he is a se. But the existence of a thing is\nintrinsic to it, not relational. So it suffices for the divine aseity\nthat God not depend on anything else for what he is intrinsically.\nThat God\u2019s knowing of Socrates depends on Socrates is not to the\npoint: this knowing is purely relational and not intrinsic to God.\n7. The Modal Collapse Objection to DDS\n7.1 Introduction to the Problem\n\nThis final section elaborates a problem posed but not pursued in the\npreceding section: the problem of reconciling the simplicity of God\nwith the contingency of creatures and the states of affairs into which\nthey enter. If the simple God knows that Tom files his income taxes on\nApril 14th, how do we avoid the conclusion that Tom and his filing are\nmodally necessary? In the last few years, numerous articles have\nappeared pressing, and responding to, the claim that the commitments\nof DDS entail the collapse of modal distinctions. One way to present\nthe problem of modal collapse is as a tension between two commitments\nof classical Christian theism. The one commitment is to DDS. The other\nis to the contingency of creatures. Simplicity of God and contingency\nof creatures form a dyad the logical consistency of which is in\nquestion. Call it the problematic dyad. The gist of the modal collapse\nargument (MCA) is that DDS entails the absolute metaphysical necessity\nof creatures. If God is simple, then he is of course also absolutely\nnecessary (not possibly nonexistent) and this for the reason that, on\nDDS, essence and existence in God are one. It also seems to follow\nfrom the divine simplicity that any creative action that God performs,\nhe necessarily performs, and this for the reason that the simple God\nis pure act harboring no unrealized potentialities. (Indeed, he\nharbors no realized potentialities either since, as actus\npurus, he harbors no potentialities at all.) Given that God\ncreated our universe U, it follows that he could not have failed to\ncreate some universe and indeed the very one he did create, namely U.\nBear in mind that the validity of the MCA requires the auxiliary\npremise that, given divine omnipotence, divine creation cannot fail to\nsucceed. Thus there cannot be anything indeterministic about it: it\ncannot be that the divine creative act is absolutely necessary while\nthe effect of that act, U, is modally contingent. (The truth of this\nauxiliary premise is questioned by some, as we shall see.) Therefore,\nU cannot not exist given that God has created it, whence it follows\nthat U and everything in it exists of absolute metaphysical necessity\njust as God does. But then the first classical commitment, DDS,\ncollides with the second, the contingency of creatures, and the\ndistinction between necessity and contingency collapses. Both God and\nthe universe end up being absolutely necessary. If MCA succeeds, then\nmodal collapse is upon us, the problematic dyad is inconsistent, and\none of the classical commitments must be rejected, either the\nsimplicity of God or the contingency of creatures. If, on the other\nhand, MCA fails, then the dyad is presumably consistent and both\ncommitments may be upheld.\n7.2 Terminology and Terrain\n\nTo begin, some terminology and a rough map of the aporetic terrain.\nTerminological regimentation in excess of that already provided in\nthis entry is necessary to bring MCA into proper focus, especially\ngiven the need to accommodate Islamic Neoplatonist responses to the\nproblem. A traditional theist is one whose definition of\n\u2018God\u2019 includes omniscience, omnipotence, omnibenevolence,\nnecessary existence, and being the creator of every concrete item\ndistinct from itself, but does not include or exclude DDS. Traditional\ntheists thus divide into those who accept, and those who reject DDS. A\ntraditional theist who accepts DDS may be termed a classical\ntheist. Classical theists divide into those who accept and those\nwho reject the modal contingency of concrete creatures. An item is\nmodally contingent just in case both its existence and its\nnonexistence are broadly logically possible. The modally contingent is\nnot the same as the existentially dependent. For creatures are\nexistentially dependent on God but need not be modally contingent.\nSo-called abstract objects (the denizens of the Platonic menagerie\nsuch as numbers and mathematical sets) are modally necessary beings\nand yet they are plausibly taken to be creatures in the sense that if,\nper impossibile, God did not exist, then they would not exist\neither. They depend on God for their existence despite their modal\nnecessity. They exist in every (metaphysically or broadly logically)\npossible world and they depend on God for their existence in every\nsuch possible world. The modally contingent and that which is\nexistentially dependent on God are therefore notionally or\nconceptually distinct. A concrete creature is any creature\nthat is not abstract, in the way \u2018abstract\u2019 is (mis)used\nby contemporary analytic philosophers to cover the inhabitants of the\nPlatonic menagerie.\n\nThe classical theists who accept both DDS and the modal contingency of\nconcrete creatures further divide into those who maintain that the MCA\ncan be successfully answered by showing that the limbs of the\nproblematic dyad mentioned above are logically consistent, and those\nwho maintain that the MCA cannot be successfully answered but that,\nnevertheless, both the simplicity limb and the contingency limb are to\nbe accepted. Among those for whom the MCA can be successfully rebutted\nwe find Greeley (2019), Nemes (2020), Schmid (2022), and Waldrop\n(2022) et al. Among those who for whom the MCA cannot be successfully\nrebutted but who nevertheless embrace both limbs of the problematic\ndyad we find the mysterian Dolezal (2011). See section 4.3 above.\n\nThe classical theists who accept DDS but reject the modal contingency\nof concrete creatures turn aside the MCA by rejecting the contingency\nlimb of the problematic dyad. Among them we find both Christian and\nnon-Christian classical theists. An Islamic Neoplatonist\ntheist is a classical theist who upholds DDS but does not uphold the\nmodal contingency of concrete creatures. Such a non-Christian\nclassical theist takes an emanationist approach to divine creation. On\nemanationism, as we find it in Ibn Sina (Avicenna), for example, God\neternally and necessarily brings into existence things wholly distinct\nfrom himself and in such a way that the things created share in the\nmodal necessity of the Creator and his creative will despite the\nexistential dependence of the creatures upon the Creator. (Andani,\n2022, 11) More on the Islamic Neoplatonist view below. There are also\nChristian classical theists who accept DDS but reject the modal\ncontingency of concrete creatures, affirming instead their\nhypothetical necessity. (Pedersen and Lilley 2022) Both types of\nclassical theist who accept DDS but reject the modal contingency of\nconcrete creatures exploit the putative distinction between absolute\n(unconditional) and hypothetical (conditional) necessity. God alone\nexists of absolute metaphysical necessity in se; creatures\nare necessary ab alio, from another, namely, from God. This\nhypothetical necessity holds for both abstract and concrete\ncreatures.\n\nFinally, we have those traditional theists who reject DDS but accept\nthe modal contingency of creatures. Among them we find Moreland and\nCraig (2003), Plantinga (1980), and Hasker (2016).\n\nThe assumption thus far is that the MCA is a (genuine) problem for\nclassical theists who accept the modal contingency of concrete\ncreatures in the sense that the MCA does not arise from some easily\ndetectable fallacy, confusion, or misuse of language. Tomaszewski\n(2019), however, alleges that the MCA in all variants succumbs to one\nor more modal fallacies. This charge has not held up well under\nscrutiny. Waldrop (2022) shows convincingly that at least three\nvariants of the MCA are free of logical error, the variants of\nMoreland and Craig (2003), Leftow (2015), and Mullins (2016).\n7.3 Solutions to the Problem of Modal Collapse\n\n(0) Reject theism. One might argue as follows.\n\nNothing could count as God that is not simple.\nDivine simplicity is logically contradictory.\nWhatever is logically contradictory cannot exist.\nTherefore, God does not exist.\n\nSolution by dissolution.\n\n(1) Accept traditional theism but reject DDS. Many if not most\nChristian theists, Protestants especially, will simply deny the divine\nsimplicity. Alvin Plantinga, for example, is a Christian theist who\nrejects DDS. (Plantinga, 1980) He is followed in this by many others\n(Moreland and Craig 2003, Hasker 2016).\n\n(2) Accept DDS, but reject the commitment to the modal contingency of\nconcrete creatures, either in a Christian way (Pedersen and Lilley\n2022) or in an Islamic way (Andani 2022). The Islamic way is further\nspecified in (5) below.\n\n(3) Accept both limbs of the problematic dyad, despite their apparent\ninconsistency, either by (a) holding that there are true\ncontradictions or, less drastically, by (b) holding that while there\nare no true contradictions, we in our present state are prevented by\nour cognitive architecture from understanding how the limbs\nof the problematic dyad could both be true. Both of these options may\nbe dubbed mysterian. The first could be called\nextreme, the second moderate. The mysterianism of\nDolezal (2011, 210) seems to be of the moderate type. (See section 4.3\nabove.) It must remain a mystery in this life how it could be true\nboth that God is simple and that concrete creatures are modally\ncontingent. And yet both are true without violation of the\nlaw of non-contradiction.\n\n(4) Accept DDS, but hold that \u201cthe only necessity or possibility\napplicable to God is not de re but de dicto.\u201d\n(Miller 1996, 13) The problem arises if we think that the modal\ncontingency of concrete creatures requires that God have the ability\nto do otherwise than what he has done. But if the only modality\napplicable to God is de dicto, then it is false to say of\nGod (de deo) that he could have done otherwise, and the\nproblem is supposedly avoided.\n\n(5) Accept DDS, but hold that creatures are really distinct from divine\ncreating and thus can have a different modal status from that of the\ndivine acts whereby they are created. Nathan Greeley writes,\n\n\n\u2026 to say that God\u2019s activity of knowing and willing exist\nnecessarily is not to say that created objects of his knowing and\nwilling must also exist necessarily. As long as these created objects\nare considered really distinct from the acts by which they\nare known and willed, then the objects in themselves, need not have\nthe same modal status as these acts. [\u2026] God, one can then say,\nnecessarily knows and necessarily wills in an absolute manner, but at\nleast some of the particular objects of his knowledge are contingent.\n(Greeley 2019, 237)\n\n\nThe idea here is that what God necessarily creates, and thus could not\nhave failed to create, can nevertheless be contingent, i.e., possibly\nnonexistent. How might this be true? Here is one way. Suppose that\nGod\u2019s creating of a thing simultaneously releases it into\nontological independence. The divine creative act makes the thing\nexist, but once it exists, it exists on its own, \u2018by its own\npower\u2019 without divine assistance. In other words, when God\ncreates a thing, he creates it in such a way that its existence,\nmoment by moment, does not depend on God\u2019s ongoing creative\nsustenance after the initial creative action. It continues by\n\u2018existential intertia.\u2019 If this is the nature of creation,\nthen the created entity could very well be contingent despite the\ncreative act\u2019s being necessary. For the created entity to exist\nin the first place it would be necessary that God create it, but after\nhe does so the entity exists contingently. On this scheme, there is\ncreatio originans (originating creation), but no creatio\ncontinuans (continuing creation). This allows what is originally\ncaused to exist to be contingent.\n\nUnfortunately, this understanding of creation is foreign to classical\ntheism. On classical theism, creation is both originating and\ncontinuing. In addition, classical theism need not insist on the\nreality of the originating-continuing distinction. For even if the\nworld (the created realm) has an infinite past and always existed, it\ncould nonetheless have creaturely status. If that were the case, then\nthere would be no real distinction between originating and continuing\ncreation. If, on the other hand, the world had a beginning in time,\nthen, on classical theism, it still needs to be kept in being moment\nby moment. The stratagem proposed by Greeley above does not appear to\nallow the proponent of divine simplicity to evade the conclusion that,\nif the simple God creates, then the product of his creative act\nnecessarily exists.\n\n(6) Accept both DDS and the modal contingency of creatures, but reject\nwhat Steven Nemes calls the difference principle (DP)\naccording to which \u201cA difference in the effect presupposes a\ndifference in the cause.\u201d (Nemes 2020, 109) If the created and\nongoingly sustained universe U is contingent, then U might never have\nexisted, and at any given time t at which U exists it might not have\nexisted at t. (God could, so to speak, \u2018pull the plug\u2019 on\nthe world at any time.) By DP, the difference in the effect (U\u2019s\nexisting versus U\u2019s not existing) presupposes and thus entails a\ndifference in the cause, namely, God. So on the DP, had God not\ncreated U, then there would have had to have been a difference in the\ncause (God\u2019s actually creating U versus God\u2019s possibly not\ncreating U). But then God would not be actus purus, pure\nactuality bare of all potency. \u201cIt is clear, therefore, that the\ndifference principle is at the heart of the argument from modal\ncollapse.\u201d (Nemes 2020, 110) Therefore, to uphold both DDS and\nthe modal contingency of concrete creatures, the DP must be rejected.\nAccordingly, there is no difference within the simple God between his\ncreating U1 and his creating the numerically different U2, and no\ndifference between either and God\u2019s creating nothing at all. The\ndifference between some U existing and no U existing on the current\nproposal reflects no difference in the divine cause. It is all the\nsame to God whether a universe exists or no universe exists. If God is\nidentical to his creating of something, and God is identical to his\ncreating of nothing, then God\u2019s creating of something is\nidentical to God\u2019s creating of nothing. That is, had God not\ncreated our universe U, he would not have been any different than he\nis is given that he has created U. God + U = God. God \u2212 U =\nGod.\n\nThe most obvious objection to this attempt at turning aside the MCA is\nthat it is merely ad hoc. If in every other conceivable case\nof agent causation the DP holds, then to deny its application in the\ncase of divine agent causation has no motivation except to avoid the\ndifficulty that MCA presents. But this allegation of\n\u2018ad-hoc-ness\u2019 is not decisive since Nemes and Co.\nare free to assert that the divine case is sui generis.\nFurthermore, if one can bring oneself to accept both DDS and the\ncontingency of concrete creatures, then why balk at the rejection of\nDP? Everyone ought to admit that DDS is a \u2018hard saying\u2019\ndespite the good, though not absolutely compelling, arguments for it.\nThere are good reasons to accept both limbs of the problematic dyad,\nDDS and the modal contingency of concrete creatures. If the only way\nto uphold both is by rejecting DP, then so be it and one must\n\u2018bite the bullet.\u2019 But then divine agent causation is so\nunlike ordinary agent causation that we lose our grip on the former:\nit threatens to peter out into unintelligibility. So it looks as if\nthe acceptors and the rejectors of the DP are in a stand-off. Suppose\nthe following are individually plausible but collectively\ninconsistent: DDS, DP, and the modal contingency of concrete\ncreatures. Suppose further that there are no true contradictions. Then\none of the propositions must be rejected. Some theists will reject\nDDS; some will reject DP; some will reject the modal contingency of\nconcrete creatures. We now turn to a solution via rejection of the\nthird proposition.\n\n(7) Accept DDS but deny the modal contingency of creatures by holding\nan emanationist view of creation along Avicennian lines according to\nwhich God must create, so that whatever is created is necessary, but\nnot necessary in the way that God is necessary. (Andani 2022) On this\napproach, the original modal collapse problem is solved by rejection\nof the second limb of the problematic dyad, namely, the modal\ncontingency of concrete creatures. But a kind of modal difference is\npreserved in that the divine necessity is held to be absolute whereas\nthe necessity of concrete creatures is held to be from another,\nnamely, from God who alone is absolutely necessary. The key idea here\nis that all creatures are modally necessary, not just the\nabstract ones. (Andani 2022, 15)\n\nWe have already noted that a classical theist can easily allow for a\ndifference between the divine necessity and the necessity of\nsome creatures, namely, those that are co-eternal with God.\nEternal objects other than God such as numbers possess necessary\nexistence through another. What classical Christian theists cannot\nsay, however, given their commitment to the creation of the material\nworld ex nihilo, is that all creatures possess\nnecessary existence through another. For if they said that, then the\nmodal contingency of concrete creatures would go by the boards, and it\nwould then not be the case that God might not have created a material\nuniverse. Not being emanationists, classical Christian theists uphold\nthe possibility that God not create any material beings at all.\nIslamic neoplatonists, however, being emanationists, do not adhere to\ncreatio ex nihilo but to creatio ex deo . This\nallows them to lump together \u201cmetaphysically necessary\nbeings\u201d and \u201cactual necessary beings: temporal material\nsubstances.\u201d (Andani 2022, 13) Among the latter we find such\nconcrete items as cats and tables. These are temporal material\nsubstances in Aristotle\u2019s sense of prote ousiai.\nBecause their existence is necessitated by God, they are necessary\nfrom another, unlike God who is not caused by another and is therefore\nnecessary in himself. \u201cAlthough God and His creation are\nlogically necessary and exist across all possible worlds, they retain\ndifferent modal categories within Ibn Sina\u2019s [Avicenna\u2019s]\nmodal framework.\u201d (Andani 2022, 15) Thus \u201c\u2026 there\nis no real modal collapse for the Islamic philosopher working\nwithin the broader Islamic Neoplatonic tradition.\u201d (Andani 2022,\n13, emphasis in original) To further spell it out, there are three\nclasses of necessary beings, where a necessary being is one that\nexists in all broadly logically possible worlds, namely, God who\nexists a se, eternal beings other than God that depend for\ntheir existence on God and thus exist ab alio, and thirdly\n\u201ctemporal existents actualized and necessary through\nanother\u201d which also exist ab alio.(Andani 2022, 30)\n\nAnd so the Islamic Neoplatonist accepts the modal collapse\nthat most Christian classical theists fear by positively affirming\nthat everything is necessary in the \u2018possible\nworlds\u2019 sense. But \u201cthere is no real modal\ncollapse for the Islamic philosopher\u201d (Andani 2022, 13) because\nabsolute necessity is understood as ontological independence and\ncontingency is understood as ontological (existential) dependence.\nThere is no collapse because of the deep difference between two modes\nof existence, existence a se and existence ab alio.\nThus God and Socrates differ in the way they exist. The essence of\nSocrates, considered in and of itself, may or may not exist. It is\n\u201cpossible in itself.\u201d Since this essence, so considered,\nmay or may not exist, if it does come to exist in actuality, it must\nhave a cause or causes of its coming to exist in actuality. These\ncauses necessitate its existence. \u201cTherefore, the\npossible in itself \u2014 when it actually exists \u2014 has the\nmodal status of \u2018necessary existence through another\u2019\n(wajib al-wujud li-ghayrihi) and [is therefore] dependent\nupon a distinct cause for its existence.\u201d (Andani 2022, 10.)\n7.4 Concluding Aporetic Postscript\n\nNone of the above responses to the modal collapse objection to divine\nsimplicity is without problems. And so it is fitting that we end on an\naporetic note. If there is a way beyond the impasse it will have to\ninvolve a deeper dive into the metaphysics of divine action in its\nrelation to the metaphysics of modality. How are to to understand\ndivine creation? Does God create out of nothing? Out of himself? Out\nof pre-given possibilities? The MCA\u2019s main value is as a\nconcrete point of entry into this constellation of difficult\nquestions.\n\nWhat holds for MCA holds also for all the problems surrounding DDS\ndetailed above. This final subsection therefore serves as a fitting\nconclusion to the entire entry.\n",
