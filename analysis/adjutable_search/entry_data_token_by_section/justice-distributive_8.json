    "main_text": "Feminist Principles\n9. Methodology and Empirical Beliefs about Distributive Justice\n\nHow are we to go about choosing between the different distributive\nprinciples on offer, and respond to criticisms of the principles?\nUnfortunately, few philosophers explicitly discuss the methodology\nthey are using. The most notable exception is John Rawls (1971, 1974)\nwho explicitly brought the method of wide reflective equilibrium to\npolitical philosophy. This method has been brilliantly discussed by\nNorman Daniels over the years and the reader is strongly encouraged to\nrefer to his entry (see\n reflective equilibrium)\n to understand how to evaluate, revise and choose between normative\nprinciples. While there is no point in reiterating the method here\nthere are some supplementary issues worth noting.\n\nEmpirical data on the beliefs of the population about distributive\njustice was not available when Rawls published A Theory of\nJustice (Rawls 1971) but much empirical work has since been\ncompleted. Swift (1995, 1999) and Miller (1999, chaps. 3\u20134) have\nprovided surveys of this literature and arguments for why those\ncommitted to the method of reflective equilibrium in distributive\njustice should take the beliefs of the population seriously, though\nnot uncritically. Indeed, some go even further, arguing that the\ndistributive decisions arising through the legitimate application of\nparticular democratic processes might even, at least in part,\nconstitute distributive justice (Walzer 1984). Data on people\u2019s\nbeliefs about distributive justice is also useful for addressing the\nnecessary intersection between philosophical and political processes.\nSuch beliefs put constraints on what institutional and policy reforms\nare practically achievable in any generation\u2014especially when\nthe society is committed to democratic processes.\n\nTwo final methodological issues need to be noted. The first concerns\nthe distinctive role counterexamples play in debates about\ndistributive justice. As noted above, the overarching methodological\nconcern of the distributive justice literature must be, in the first\ninstance, the pressing choice of how the benefits and burdens of\neconomic activity should be distributed, rather than the mere\nuncovering of abstract truth. Principles are to be implemented in real\nsocieties with the problems and constraints inherent in such\napplication. Given this, pointing out that the application of any\nparticular principle will have some, perhaps many, immoral results\nwill not by itself constitute a fatal counterexample to any\ndistributive theory. Such counter-evidence to a theory would only be\nfatal if there were an alternative, or improved, version of the\ntheory, which, if fully implemented, would yield a morally preferable\nsociety overall. So, it is at least possible that the best\ndistributive theory, when implemented, might yield a system which\nstill has many injustices and/or negative consequences. This practical\naspect partly distinguishes the role of counterexamples in\ndistributive justice theory from many other philosophical areas. Given\nthat distributive justice is about what to do now, not just what to\nthink, alternate distributive theories must, in part, compete as\ncomprehensive systems which take into account the practical\nconstraints we face. \n\nThe second and related methodological point is that the evaluation of\nalternate distributive principles requires us (and their advocates) to\nconsider the application of the distributive principle in society. If\nit is uncertain or indeterminate how a particular distributive\nprinciple might in practice apply to the ordering of real societies,\nthen this principle is not yet a serious candidate for our\nconsideration. This is also true of principles whose implementation is\npractically impossible given the institutional, psychological,\ninformational, administrative, or technical constraints of a society.\nDistributive justice is not an area where we can say an idea is good\nin theory but not in practice. If it is not good in practice, then it\nis not good in theory either.\n",
