Explanatory Versions of the Argument\n\nThe arguments against holism from Maddy and Sober resulted in a\nreevaluation of the indispensability argument. If, contra Quine,\nscientists do not accept all the entities of our best scientific\ntheories, where does this leave us? We need criteria for when to treat\nposits realistically. Here is where the debate over the\nindispensability argument took an interesting turn. Scientific\nrealists, at least, accept those posits of our best scientific\ntheories that contribute to scientific explanations. According to this\nline of thought, we ought to believe in electrons, say, not because\nthey are indispensable to our best scientific theories but because\nthey are indispensable in a very specific way: they are\nexplanatorily indispensable. If mathematics could be shown to\ncontribute to scientific explanations in this way, mathematical\nrealism would again be on par with scientific realism. Indeed, this is\nthe focus of most of the contemporary discussion on the\nindispensability argument. The central question is: does mathematics\ncontribute to scientific explanations and if so, does it do it in the\nright kind of way.\n\nOne example of how mathematics might be thought to be explanatory is\nfound in the periodic cicada case (Yoshimura 1997 and Baker 2005).\nNorth American Magicicadas are found to have life cycles of 13 or 17\nyears. It is proposed by some biologists that there is an evolutionary\nadvantage in having such prime-numbered life cycles. Prime-numbered\nlife cycles mean that the Magicicadas avoid competition, potential\npredators, and hybridisation. The idea is quite simple: because prime\nnumbers have no non-trivial factors, there are very few other life\ncycles that can be synchronised with a prime-numbered life cycle. The\nMagicicadas thus have an effective avoidance strategy that, under\ncertain conditions, will be selected for. While the explanation being\nadvanced involves biology (e.g. evolutionary theory, theories of\ncompetition and predation), a crucial part of the explanation comes\nfrom number theory, namely, the fundamental fact about prime numbers.\nBaker (2005) argues that this is a genuinely mathematical explanation\nof a biological fact. There are other examples of alleged mathematical\nexplanations in the literature but this remains the most widely\ndiscussed and is something of a poster child for mathematical\nexplanation.\n\nQuestions about this case focus on whether the mathematics is really\ncontributing to the explanation (or whether it is merely standing in\nfor the biological facts and it is these that really do the\nexplaining), whether the alleged explanation is an explanation at all,\nand whether the mathematics in question is involved in the explanation\nin the right kind of way. Finally, it is worth mentioning that\nalthough the recent interest in mathematical explanation arose out of\ndebates over the indispensability argument, the status of mathematical\nexplanations in the empirical sciences has also attracted interest in\nits own right. Moreover, such explanations (sometimes called\n\u201cextra-mathematical explanations\u201d) lead one very naturally\nto think about explanations of mathematical facts by appeal to further\nmathematical facts (sometimes called \u201cintra-mathematical\nexplanation\u201d). These two kinds of mathematical explanation are\nrelated, of course. If, for example, some theorem of mathematics has\nits explanation rest in an explanatory proof, then any applications of\nthat theorem in the empirical realm would give rise to a prima facie\ncase that the full explanation of the empirical phenomenon in question\ninvolves the intra-mathematical explanation of the theorem. For these\nand other reasons, both kinds of mathematical explanation have\nattracted a great deal of interest from philosophers of mathematics\nand philosophers of science in recent years.\n",
