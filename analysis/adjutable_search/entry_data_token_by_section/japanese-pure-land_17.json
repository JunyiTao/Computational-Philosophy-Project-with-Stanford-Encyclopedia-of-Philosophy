Japanese Pure Land Buddhism\u2019s Encounter with Modernity\n\nThe term modernity commonly indicates the cultural principles\nstemming from the European Enlightenment that became dominant globally\nin the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including such\nideals as reason, empirical science, individualism, freedom, and so\non. Japan\u2019s encounter with modernity represents a particularly\nclear and well-defined case, for up until the mid-nineteenth century,\nJapan had an official policy of isolation, restricting all\ninternational contact. Political stability, including religious\ninstitutions, had continued without significant threat or conflict for\nnearly two and a half centuries, during which a relatively peaceful,\nprosperous, and culturally active citizenry flourished. After being\nforcibly opened to foreign commerce in 1853, Japanese leaders emerged\nwho were fearful of the efforts by Western powers to exert control\nover the country through utilizing internal conflict. They sought\nfundamental political change without large-scale civil warfare and\nsuccessfully effected a shift in power from the shogunate nominally to\nthe emperor in 1868. Further, they entered upon a deliberate program\nof importing and adopting Western learning, technology, and\nsociopolitical institutions. Christianity was perceived as woven into\nthe fabric of modern civilization and as providing the moral\nfoundation for Western advances. Hence, some Japanese believed the\nsuccessful assimilation of Western technology and social institution\nwould require the adoption of Christianity.\n",
