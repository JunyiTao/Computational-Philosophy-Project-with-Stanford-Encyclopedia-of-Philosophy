    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nPierre Bayle was born on the 18th of November, 1647, in Le\nCarla (now Carla-Bayle), in the south of France. The Bayles were\nHuguenots (French Protestants), and Pierre\u2019s father Jean was the\nminister of Carla. Although Jean and his wife Jane de Brugui\u00e8re\ndescended from good families, they were poor. Pierre had two brothers,\nJacob his senior and Joseph his junior, and he had to wait for the\nformer to complete his studies at the Protestant Academy of Puylaurens\nbefore the family could afford to send the next son to school. So, to\nhis lifelong chagrin, Bayle did not start his formal education until\naround the age of twenty.\n\nDespite his lack of early formal training, Bayle flourished but also\ngrew bored at the Protestant Academy. He would complete the work\nassigned, and then in his leisure time delve into the writings of\nPlutarch and Montaigne, his favourite authors. Puylaurens could not\nsatisfy his desire to compensate for what he perceived as a wasted\nyouth, so Bayle set his sights on the nearby Jesuit university in\nToulouse, one of the best schools in France. He enrolled there at the\nage of twenty-one, and soon thereafter converted to Catholicism. This\nwas not required of Bayle; many Protestants studied at Jesuit\nuniversities. The conversion seems to have been sincere, the logical\nconsequence in Bayle\u2019s mind of losing so many theological\ndebates to Catholics upon arriving in Toulouse. This conversion was\nconsidered a great acquisition by the Church; when Bayle defended his\nmaster\u2019s theses, the most distinguished people in the city\nattended and celebrated his (and their) achievement. But their pride\nwould be short-lived. Bayle\u2019s debate skills apparently improved\nat Toulouse and he found replies to the Catholic objections that had\nonce embarrassed him. He abjured the Catholic faith mere days after\ncompleting his studies. This made Bayle a \u201crelapse\u201d, and\nrendered him subject to severe penalties in France. He therefore fled\nto Geneva, where he took up the mind-numbing work of tutoring.\n\nIn 1675, Bayle cautiously returned to France to take up a more\nstimulating post as Professor of Philosophy at the Protestant Academy\nof Sedan, a position he owed in part to the support of Pierre Jurieu,\nwho was Professor of Divinity. Bayle labored day and night to compose\nhis System of Philosophy (OD IV: 199\u2013520), the course in\nLogic, Ethics, Metaphysics, and Physics that Bayle delivered to his\nstudents in Sedan. The course is traditional in its structure, but\ncontains some content that foreshadows aspects of Bayle\u2019s later\ndistinctive thought. However, Bayle\u2019s first original\nphilosophical work is his 1679 Objections to Pierre\nPoiret\u2019s Rational Thoughts on God, the Soul, and\nEvil (OD IV: 146\u2013161). In his Objections, Bayle engages\nfor the first time with the issue that would dominate much of his\ncareer: the intractability of the problem of evil.\n\nThe Edict of Nantes, which had guaranteed some limited freedom of\nreligion to Protestants in France since 1598, was not formally revoked\nby Louis XIV until 1685, but it was undermined by the Sun King\nrepeatedly for years before the Revocation. One strategy for\npersecuting Protestants involved closing their Academies. Louis XIV\nstarted with Sedan, dissolving it by formal decree in 1681, leaving\nBayle and Jurieu out of work. Both fled to Rotterdam where the city\nestablished an \u201cIllustrious School\u201d for them. Shortly\nafter arriving in Rotterdam, Bayle published the first edition of the\nwork that would eventually be known as his Various Thoughts on the\nOccasion of a Comet (Pens\u00e9es diverses sur la\ncom\u00e8te; OD III: 3\u2013160), which attacks superstition and\nproposes the possibilities of a virtuous atheist and a society of\natheists. Like nearly all of his works, it was published\npseudonymously, but soon it was known widely that Bayle was its\nauthor, and he earned the moniker, \u201cPhilosopher of\nRotterdam\u201d. Initially, Jurieu praised the work; years later, he\nwould use its arguments on behalf of virtuous atheists as the basis\nfor accusing Bayle himself of atheism.\n\nAs the situation of Protestants in France worsened, Bayle focused his\nliterary efforts on attacking religious intolerance and developing\narguments for freedom of conscience and toleration. His major works on\nthese topics are the General Critique of Maimbourg\u2019s History\nof Calvinism (1682; OD II: 1\u2013160); New Letters by the Author\nof the General Critique of Maimbourg\u2019s History of Calvinism\n(1685; OD II: 161\u2013335); The Condition of Wholly Catholic France\nunder Louis the Great (1686; OD II: 336\u2013354); and his\nmasterpiece, A Philosophical Commentary on These Words of Jesus\nChrist: Compel Them to Enter (1686\u201388; OD II: 355\u2013444). The\nKing himself ordered the first of these works to be burned. In 1685,\nBayle\u2019s older brother Jacob was imprisoned on account of this\nsame work, since the French authorities could not find Pierre. Soon\nthereafter, Bayle\u2019s father died of natural causes, then Jacob\ndied in his prison cell from its poor conditions. Bayle learned of all\nof this around the same time he learned of the Revocation. Many Bayle\nscholars note a shift in tone and focus in Bayle\u2019s works before\nand after this crisis year of 1685; some believe he lost all faith in\nGod in these dire months.\n\nThe last twenty years of Bayle\u2019s biography are indistinguishable\nfrom his bibliography. He wrote and published literally millions of\nwords on nearly every philosophical topic. His international\nreputation was secured early in this period by the establishment of\nhis journal of literary criticism, one of the first of its kinds, the\nNews from the Republic of Letters (Nouvelles de la\nr\u00e9publique des lettres; OD I: 1\u2013760), which he edited, and\nauthored nearly single-handedly, from 1684\u20131687. But just as\nBayle\u2019s star was rising, his once friend and soon-to-be enemy\nJurieu did everything in his power to eclipse it. The late 1680s and\nearly 1690s saw Bayle embroiled in bitter disputes with the jealous\nand vindictive Jurieu, whose accusations ultimately led to the\nsuppression of Bayle\u2019s Chair at the Illustrious School in\n1693.\n\nBayle\u2019s freedom from the burden of teaching threatened his\nfinancial security but allowed him to concentrate on the work for\nwhich he is most well-known today: the Historical and Critical\nDictionary (first edition 1697). It was, and remains, unlike\nanything ever written before or after. Across the top of each page of\nthis six-million-word encyclopedia, one finds short factual articles\non topics arranged alphabetically, dealing mainly with ancient and\nmodern authors, which display the vastness of Bayle\u2019s mastery of\nhistory and literature. But roughly 80% of the work is contained in\ntwo-columns of footnotes that take up most of each page and that offer\ncritical remarks on the slim factual content above. These footnotes,\nor \u201cremarks\u201d, give free rein to Bayle the revolutionary\nphilosopher. In these remarks we find original objections to\nDescartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz; arguments on behalf of ancient\nskepticism; strong reformulations of Zeno\u2019s paradoxes;\nmetaphysical foundations for religious toleration; refutations of all\nknown answers to the problem of evil; as well as obscene stories,\nhilarious anecdotes, feigned dialogues, and endless quotations of\nminor authors that Bayle thought his readers would simply enjoy. The\nwork was a commercial success but also a scandal. The last five years\nof Bayle\u2019s life were spent writing works that defended his\ncharacter against various accusations against it made on the basis of\nthe Dictionary. The influence of the work on subsequent\nEnlightenment philosophers, from Voltaire and Hume to Rousseau and\nKant, is well established.\n\nBayle died in December, 1706, pen-in-hand, putting the final touches\nto his Dialogues of Maximus and Themistius (posthumous 1707;\nOD IV: 1\u2013106), an apology of Bayle\u2019s life and works in general,\nbut in particular a defence of his most notorious thesis, that there\nis no solution to the problem of evil. Bayle allegedly declared\nshortly before dying that he was \u201ca Christian\nphilosopher\u201d. Whether or not this confession was sincere, one\nthing that is beyond doubt is that Bayle\u2019s philosophical\nreflection challenged the rational foundations of Christian thought\nmore strongly than the reflection of any philosopher before him.\n",
