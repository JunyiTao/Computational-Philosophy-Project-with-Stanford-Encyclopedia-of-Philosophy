    "main_text": "Demonstration || Formal Logic and the Logic of Scientific Discourse\n6.8 Formal Logic and the Logic of Scientific Discourse\n\nAvicenna is open about the fact that the project undertaken in\nthe investigation of formal aspects of logic goes beyond its application in\nthe sciences (Qiy\u0101s\n IV.1).[25]\n\nAt the same time he is also open about the fact that the formal apparatus\ndeveloped in the syllogistic is not exclusively analyzed for the sake\nof studying its properties as a logical system. In fact, on multiple\noccasions Avicenna tells us that the various tools developed for\ninstance in the Qiy\u0101s are used in the sciences, or offers\nremarks on theoretical questions by specifying the default\ninterpretation in the context of scientific reasoning. This is the case (just to mention a few significant examples) in\nthe discussion of reductio ad absurdum and conditionals with\nimpossible antecedents and consequents (Qiy\u0101s\nV.4\u20135); in his account of descriptional necessity as the\ncanonical reading of necessity propositions (Burh\u0101n\nII.1, Qiy\u0101s II.2, Na\u011f\u0101t 123); in\nthe acknowledgment that premises and conclusions of scientific syllogisms may\nbe categorical as well as hypothetical propositions\n(Qiy\u0101s V.1, Burh\u0101n II.6); when he contends\nthat certain hypothetical syllogisms are less used in the sciences\n(Na\u011f\u0101t 82); when he draws connections between the\ntwo areas (Qiy\u0101s VI.5, Burh\u0101n I.7:\ninduction and qiy\u0101s muqassam; Burh\u0101n IV.1:\nif-question and conditional reasoning); or in maintaining the conditional character\nof certain principles in the particular sciences (Burh\u0101n II.7)\n(Strobino 2017).\n\nWhile the formal development of logic undeniably acquires for Avicenna\nan autonomous status that invites its own independent theoretical\nquestions, to see it as an entirely separate enterprise, detached from\napplication in the context of scientific discourse, would betray a\nmisconception of his intentions as well as of his practice.\n",
