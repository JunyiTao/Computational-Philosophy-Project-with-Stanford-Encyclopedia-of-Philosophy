    "main_text": "Locke on knowledge in natural philosophy: Scientia and human knowledge\n2. Locke on knowledge in natural philosophy: Scientia and human knowledge\n\nLocke\u2019s great epistemological contribution to philosophy is a\nconception of human knowledge suitable for the experimental science of\nhis day, one that in natural philosophy will replace the old,\nAristotelian conception. According to the Aristotelian conception,\nscientific knowledge\u2014scientia\u2014is certain\nknowledge of necessary truths, which can be expressed in syllogistic\nform, the conclusion following from self-evident premises. In the\ndomain of natural philosophy, it is certain knowledge of real\nessences. Although Locke does not seriously entertain a radical\nskepticism\u2014finding \u201ca very manifest difference between\ndreaming of being in the Fire, and being actually in it\u201d (E\nIV.ii.14, pp.537\u2013538)\u2014he recognizes that the demands of\nscientia are too stringent for the new, experimental science.\nNevertheless, the concept of scientia plays an important role\nas he develops his conception of the probabilistic sort of knowledge\nthat is possible for humans in the domain of natural philosophy: it\nserves as a foil as he explains why humans must settle for\nprobabilistic knowledge in natural philosophy, where scientia\nwill always remain out of reach. Scientia can serve as a foil\nbecause it is attainable for human beings in certain domains; however\nLocke thinks that for nobler spirits, notably angels, it is also\nattainable within natural philosophy.\n\nThis section begins by reviewing the history of the concept of\nscientia and the factors that prevent human beings from\nattaining it in natural philosophy, which impel Locke to develop an\nalternative conception of human knowledge there. This section also\nexplains what Locke thinks scientia in natural philosophy\nwould amount to and the lesser human knowledge that must serve us in\nits place.\n",
