Epistemological Issues\n\nSince the subjects of religious experiences tend to take them to be\nreal experiences of some external reality, we may ask what reason\nthere is to think they are right. That is to say, do religious\nexperiences amount to good reasons for religious belief? One answer to\nthat question is what is often called the Argument from Religious\nExperience: Religious experiences are in all relevant respects like\nsensory experiences; sensory experiences are excellent grounds for\nbeliefs about the physical world; so religious experiences are\nexcellent grounds for religious beliefs. This argument, or one very\nlike it, can be found in Swinburne (1979), Alston (1991), Plantinga\n(1981, 2000), Netland (2022) and others. Critics of this approach\ngenerally find ways in which religious experiences are different from\nsensory experiences, and argue that those differences are enough to\nundermine the evidential value of the experiences. Swinburne (1979)\ninvokes what he calls the \u201cPrinciple of Credulity,\u201d\naccording to which one is justified in believing that what seems to\none to be present actually is present, unless some appropriate\ndefeater is operative. He then discusses a variety of circumstances\nthat would be defeaters in the ordinary sensory case, and argues that\nthose defeaters do not obtain, or not always, in the case of religious\nexperience. To reject his argument, one would have to show that\nreligious experience is unlike sensory experience in that in the\nreligious case, one or more of the defeaters always obtains. Anyone\nwho accepts the principle has excellent reason to accept the\ndeliverances of religious experience, unless he or she believes that\ndefeaters always, or almost always, obtain.\n\nPlantinga offers a different kind of argument. According to\nCartesian-style foundationalism, in order to count as justified, a\nbelief must either be grounded in other justified beliefs, or derive\nits justification from some special status, like infallibility,\nincorrigibility, or indubitability. There is a parallel view about\nknowledge. Plantinga (1981) argued that such a foundationalism is\ninconsistent with holding one\u2019s own ordinary beliefs about the\nworld to be justified (or knowledge), because our ordinary beliefs\nderived from sense-experience aren\u2019t derived from anything\ninfallible, indubitable, or incorrigible. In fact, we typically treat\nthem as foundational, in need of no further justification. If we hold\nsensory beliefs to be properly basic, then we have to hold similarly\nformed religious beliefs, formed on experiences of God manifesting\nhimself to a believer (Plantinga calls them \u2018M-beliefs\u2019),\nas properly basic. He proposed that human beings have a\nfaculty\u2014what John Calvin called the \u2018sensus\ndivinitatis\u2019\u2014that allows them to be aware of\nGod\u2019s actions or dispositions with respect to them. If beliefs\nformed by sense-experience can be properly basic, then beliefs formed\nby this faculty cannot, in any principled way, be denied that same\nstatus. His developed theory of warrant (2000) implies that, if the\nbeliefs are true, then they are warranted. One cannot attack claims of\nreligious experience without first addressing the question as to\nwhether the religious claims are true. He admits that, since there are\npeople in other religious traditions who have based beliefs about\nreligious matters on similar purported manifestations, they may be\nable to make the same argument about their own religious\nexperiences.\n\nAlston develops a general theory of doxastic practices (constellations\nof belief-forming mechanisms, together with characteristic background\nassumptions and sets of defeaters), gives an account of what it is to\nrationally engage in such a practice, and then argues that at least\nthe practice of forming beliefs on the basis of Christian religious\nexperiences fulfills those requirements. If we think of the broad\ndoxastic practices we currently employ, we see that some of them can\nbe justified by the use of other practices. The practice of science,\nfor example, reduces mostly to the practices of sense-perception,\ndeductive reasoning, and inductive reasoning (memory and testimony\nalso make contributions, of course). The justificatory status the\npractice gives to its product beliefs derives from those more basic\npractices. Most, however, cannot be so reduced. How are they\njustified, then? It seems that they cannot be justified\nnon-circularly, that is, without the use of premises derived from the\npractices themselves. Our only justification for continuing to trust\nthese practices is that they are firmly established, interwoven with\nother practices and projects of ours, and have \u201cstood the test\nof time\u201d by producing mostly consistent sets of beliefs. They\nproduce a sufficiently consistent set of beliefs if they don\u2019t\nproduce massive, unavoidable contradictions on central matters, either\ninternally, or with the outputs of other equally well-established\npractices. If that\u2019s all there is to be said about our ordinary\npractices, then we ought to extend the same status to other practices\nthat have the same features. He then argues that the Christian\npractice of belief-formation on the basis of religious experience does\nhave those features. Like Plantinga, he admits that such an argument\nmight be equally available to other religious practices; it all\ndepends on whether the practice in question generates massive and\nunavoidable contradictions, on central matters, either internally, or\nwith other equally well-established practices. To undermine this\nargument, one would have to show either that Alston\u2019s criteria\nfor rationality of a practice are too permissive, or that religious\npractices never escape massive contradictions.\n\nBoth Plantinga\u2019s and Alston\u2019s defense of the epistemic\nvalue of religious experiences turn crucially on some degree of\nsimilarity with sense-experience. But they are not simple arguments\nfrom analogy; not just any similarities will do to make the positive\nargument, and not just any dissimilarities will do to defeat the\nargument. The similarities or dissimilarities need to be\nepistemologically relevant. It is not enough, for example, to show\nthat religious experiences do not typically allow for independent\npublic verification, unless one wants to give up on other perfectly\nrespectable practices, like rational intuition, that also lack that\nfeature.\n\nThe two most important defeaters on the table for claims of the\nepistemic authority of religious experience are the fact of religious\ndiversity, and the availability of naturalistic explanations for\nreligious experiences. Religious diversity is a prima facie defeater\nfor the veridicality of religious experiences in the same way that\nwildly conflicting eyewitness reports undermine each other. If the\nreports are at all similar, then it may be reasonable to conclude that\nthere is some truth to the testimony, at least in broad outline. A\nversion of this objection is the argument from divine hiddenness (cf.\nLovering 2013). If God exists, and shows himself to some people in\nreligious experiences, then the fact that he doesn\u2019t do so for\nmore people, more widely distributed, requires some explanation.\nAxtell provides another version of that objection. He argues that to\ninsist that one\u2019s own religious convictions are true in the face of\nthe diversity of religions is to reason counter-inductively, and is\ntherefore irrational. The reasoning is counter-inductive because your\nown convictions come from the same kinds of epistemic sources\n(investment in testimonial authority) as those you deem to be wrong,\nso if you are right, it is just a matter of luck. But if two\neyewitness reports disagree on the most basic facts about what\nhappened, then it seems that neither gives you good grounds for any\nbeliefs about what happened. It certainly seems that the contents of\nreligious-experience reports are radically different from one another.\nSome subjects of religious experiences report experience of\nnothingness as the ultimate reality, some a vast impersonal\nconsciousness in which we all participate, some an infinitely perfect,\npersonal creator. To maintain that one\u2019s own religious\nexperiences are veridical, one would have to a) find some common core\nto all these experiences, such that in spite of differences of detail,\nthey could reasonably be construed as experiences of the same reality,\nor b) insist that one\u2019s own experiences are veridical, and that\ntherefore those of other traditions are not veridical. The first is\ndifficult to manage, in the face of the manifest differences across\nreligions. Nevertheless, John Hick (1989) develops a view of that\nkind, making use of a Kantian two-worlds epistemology. The idea is\nthat the object of these experiences, in itself, is one and the same\nreality, but it is experienced phenomenally by different people\ndifferently. Thus, is possible to see how one and the same object can\nbe experienced in ways that are completely incompatible with one\nanother. This approach is only as plausible as the Kantian framework\nitself is. Jerome Gellman (2001) proposes a similar idea, without the\nKantian baggage. Solutions like these leave the problem untouched: If\nthe different practices produce experiences the contents of which are\ninconsistent with one another, one of the practices must be\nunreliable. Alston (1991) and Plantinga (2000) develop the second kind\nof answer. The general strategy is to argue that, from within a\ntradition, a person acquires epistemic resources not available to\nthose outside the tradition, just as travelling to the heart of a\njungle allows one to see things that those who have not made the\njourney can\u2019t see. As a result, even if people in other\ntraditions can make the same argument, it is still reasonable to say\nthat some are right and the others are wrong. The things that justify\nmy beliefs still justify them, even if you have comparable resources\njustifying a contrary view.\n\nNaturalistic explanations for religious experiences are thought to\nundermine their epistemic value because, if the naturalistic\nexplanation is sufficient to explain the experience, we have no\ngrounds for positing anything beyond that naturalistic cause. Freud\n(1927) and Marx (1876/1977) are frequently held up as offering such\nexplanations. Freud claims that religious experiences can be\nadequately explained by psychological mechanisms having their root in\nearly childhood experience and psychodynamic tensions. Marx similarly\nattributes religious belief in general to materialistic economic\nforces. Both claim that, since the hidden psychological or economic\nexplanations are sufficient to explain the origins of religious\nbelief, there is no need to suppose, in addition, that the beliefs are\ntrue. Freud\u2019s theory of religion has few adherents, even among\nthe psychoanalytically inclined, and Marx\u2019s view likewise has\nall but been abandoned, but that is not to say that something in the\nneighborhood might not be true. More recently, neurological\nexplanations of religious experience have been put forward as reasons\nto deny the veridicality of the experiences. Events in the brain that\noccur during meditative states and other religious experiences are\nvery similar to events that happen during certain kinds of seizures,\nor with certain kinds of mental disorders, and can also be induced\nwith drugs. Therefore, it is argued, there is nothing more to\nreligious experiences than what happens in seizures, mental disorders,\nor drug experiences. Some who are studying the neurological basis of\nreligious experience do not infer that they are not veridical (see,\ne.g., d\u2019Aquili and Newberg 1999), but many do. Guthrie (1995),\nfor example, argues that religion has its origin in our tendency to\nanthropomorphize phenomena in our vicinity, seeing agency where there\nis none.\n\nThere are general problems with all kinds of naturalistic explanations\nas defeaters. First of all, as Gellman (2001) points out, most such\nexplanations (like the psychoanalytic and socio-political ones) are\nput forward as hypotheses, not as established facts. The proponent\nassumes that the experiences are not veridical, then casts around for\nan explanation. This is not true of the neurological explanations, but\nthey face another kind of weakness noted by Ellwood (1999):\nevery experience, whatever its source, is accompanied by a\ncorresponding neurological state. To argue that the experience is\nillusory because there is a corresponding brain state is fallacious.\nThe same reasoning would lead us to conclude that sensory experiences\nare illusory, since in each sensory experience, there is some\ncorresponding neurological state that is just like the state that\noccurs in the corresponding hallucination. The proponent of the\nnaturalistic explanation as a defeater owes us some reason to believe\nthat his or her argument is not just another skeptical argument from\nthe veil of perception.\n\nOne further epistemological worry accompanies religious experience.\nJames claimed that, while mystical experiences proved authoritative\ngrounds for belief in the person experiencing them, they cannot give\ngrounds for a person to whom the experience is reported. In other\nwords, my experience is evidence for me, but not for you. Bovens\n(2012) gives a modern expansion and explanation of this claim. The\nclaim can be understood in a variety of ways, depending on the kind of\nnormativity that attaches to the purported evidential relation. Some\n(see Oakes 1976, for example) have claimed that religious experiences\nepistemically can necessitate belief; that is, anyone who has the\nexperience and doesn\u2019t form the corresponding belief is making\nan epistemic mistake, much like a person who, in normal conditions,\nrefuses to believe his or her eyes. More commonly, defenders of the\nepistemic value of religious experience claim that the experiences\nmake it epistemically permissible to form the belief, but you may also\nbe justified in not forming the belief. The testimony of other people\nabout what they have experienced is much the same. In some cases, a\nperson would be unjustified in rejecting the testimony of others, and\nin other cases, one would be justified in accepting it, but need not\naccept it. This leaves us with three possibilities, on the assumption\nthat the subject of the experience is justified in forming a religious\nbelief on the basis of his or her experience, and that he or she tells\nsomeone else about it: the testimony might provide compelling evidence\nfor the hearer, such that he or she would be unjustified in rejecting\nthe claim; the testimony might provide non-compelling justification\nfor the hearer to accept the claim; or the testimony might fail to\nprovide any kind of grounds for the hearer to accept the claim. When a\nsubject makes a claim on the basis of an ordinary experience, it might\nfall into any one of these three categories, depending on the\nclaim\u2019s content and the epistemic situation of the hearer. The\nmost natural thing to say about religious experience claims is that\nthey work the same way (on the assumption that they give the subject\nof the experience, who is making the claim, any justification for his\nor her beliefs). James, and some others after him, claim that\ntestimony about religious experiences cannot fall under either of the\nfirst two categories. If that\u2019s true, it must be because of\nsomething special about the nature of the experiences. If we assume\nthat the experiences cannot be shown a priori to be defective\nsomehow, and that religious language is intelligible\u2014and if we\ndo not make these assumptions, then the question of religious\ntestimony doesn\u2019t even arise\u2014then it must be because the\nevidential value of the experience is so small that it cannot survive\ntransmission to another person; that is, it must be that in the\nordinary act of reporting an experience to someone else, there is some\ndefeater at work that is always stronger than whatever evidential\nforce the experience itself has. While there are important differences\nbetween ordinary sense-experience and religious experience (clarity of\nthe experience, amount of information it contains, presence of\ncompeting explanations, and the like), it is not clear whether the\ndifferences are great enough to disqualify religious testimony always\nand everywhere.\n",
