    "main_text": "The Mental in Mental Disorder || Internal Causes and Downstream (Symptomatic) Manifestations\n3.1 Internal Causes and Downstream (Symptomatic) Manifestations\n\nOn traditional, two-part models from cell pathology, dysfunctional\norganic processes internal to the individual are manifested in, and\ncausally responsible for, more readily observable signs and symptoms;\ncollectively, these two parts make up the disease. Applied to mental\ndisorder, certain of those underlying processes have been delimited as\nmental by appeal to the traditional categories of faculty psychology\n(perception, affection, cognition, memory, and so on). For example,\nhallucinations represent dysfunctional perceptual capabilities, mania\nand depression disturbed affect regulation, and delusions defective\ncognitive processing. A disorder is thus determined to be mental as\ndistinct from physical if its internal causes involve psychological\nfaculties (Wakefield 1997). Other accounts ascribe disordered\nmentality not to underlying features but to effects on the\nsubject\u2019s social and personal functioning (Rashed & Bingham\n2014). For example, it is because her states of sadness and self-doubt\nresult in absenteeism, that the person with depression seeks medical\nhelp (see\n \u00a74.2).\n More holistic and \u201cbiopsychosocial\u201d accounts combine\nthese features (see Nordenfelt 1995; Davies & Roache 2017; Bolton\n& Gillett 2019; O\u2019Leary 2021).\n\nOn two-stage accounts both internal and outwardly-observed features\nform integral parts. (At least this is true of mental disorders that\nare prototypical, according to George Graham [2013].) Internal and\nmore readily observable features are each included in the DSM\ndefinition of mental disorder:\n\n\na syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an\nindividual\u2019s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior, that\nreflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological or\ndevelopmental processes underlying mental functioning. (APA 2013: 20,\nemphasis added)\n\n\nThe different positions on mental disorder just\nsketched\u2014emphasizing internal conditions, observable\nmanifestations (or \u201csymptoms\u201d), and both\u2014are\ndiscussed in\n Section 4.\n Each position exhibits vulnerabilities. Accounts stressing inherent\nfeatures regularly rely on hypothetical entities or processes,\nexpecting that out of future discoveries will emerge knowledge of\ncausal mechanisms presently hidden from view. (This position has a\nlong history; for a thoroughgoing version, see Murphy 2012.) Often\naccounted for by its status as a new science, this faith has been\nsorely tested, thus far, by confused classifications, apparently\nill-grounded research, and other liabilities, as well as incomplete\nmodels of mental dysfunction (see\n \u00a74\n and\n \u00a76).\n If these impediments can be overcome, emphasis on internal causes may\nbe expected to yield powerful explanatory models, laying the ground\nfor incalculably valuable, targeted interventions and effective\nprevention and treatment. (See entry on Philosophy of Psychiatry).\nPlacing emphasis on disabling or dysfunctional observable symptoms has\ncomparable vulnerabilities. One setting\u2019s dysfunctional mental\nsymptom may be another\u2019s normal, admired, or useful trait; and\nmental disorder must be distinguished conceptually from deviance, as\nwell as from normal responses to the losses and setbacks that are our\ncommon human experience (these issues are discussed in\n \u00a74,\n \u00a78, and\n \u00a710).\n",
