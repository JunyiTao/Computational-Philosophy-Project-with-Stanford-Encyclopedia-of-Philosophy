Mind wandering is frequent in waking\nand involves spontaneous thoughts that unfold dynamically and are only\nweakly constrained by ongoing tasks and environmental demands\n(Schooler et al. 2011; Smallwood & Schooler 2015; Christoff et al.\n2016). Based on phenomenological and neurophysiological similarities,\ndreams have been proposed to be an intensified form of waking mind\nwandering (Pace-Schott 2007, 2013; Domhoff 2011; Wamsley 2013; Fox et\nal. 2013). This basic idea seems to have been anticipated by Leibniz,\nwho noted that the spontaneous formation of visions in dreams\nsurpasses the capacity of our waking imagination (Leibniz,\nPhilosophical Papers and Letters, Vol. I, 177\u2013178).\n\nThe analogy between dreams and waking mind wandering has been\ndiscussed in the context of cognitive agency. Metzinger (2013a,b,\n2015) describes dreams and waking mind wandering as involving a\ncyclically recurring loss of mental autonomy, or the ability to\ndeliberately control one\u2019s conscious thought processes. Dreams\nand waking mind wandering are not mental actions but unintentional\nmental behaviors, comparable to subpersonal processes such as\nbreathing or heartbeat. Because dreaming and waking mind wandering\nmake up a the majority of our conscious mental lives, he argues that\ncognitive agency and mental autonomy are the exception, not the\nrule.\n\nThis raises the question of how to make sense of lucid control dreams,\nwhich involve both meta-awareness and agency. Windt and Voss (2018)\nargue that in such cases, spontaneous processes including imagery\nformation co-exist alongside more deliberate, top-down control; they\nalso argue metacognitive insight and control themselves can have\nspontaneous elements. This suggests spontaneity and control are not\nopposites, but a more complex account is needed. Possibly, certain\ndreams and instances of waking mind wandering can be both spontaneous\nand agentive.\n\nThe analogy with mind wandering might help move forward the debate on\nthe ontology of dreaming. In this debate, a common assumption is that\ndreams can be categorized as either hallucinatory or imaginative. Yet\nthe application of these terms to dreams quickly runs into\ncounterexamples and it is unclear they are mutually exclusive. One\noption is pluralism (Rosen 2018b), in which some aspects of dreaming\nare hallucinatory, others imaginative, and yet again others illusory.\nAnother is that dreams are sui generis, combining aspects associated\nwith wake states such as hallucinating, imagining, or perceiving in a\nnovel manner without mimicking them completely. Windt (2015a) proposes\nthat mind wandering, which describes a range of mental states loosely\ncharacterized by their spontaneous and dynamic character, might be\nparticularly suitable for the characterization of dreaming precisely\nbecause that term leaves open more specific questions on the\nphenomenology of dreaming, allowing for variation in control,\ndeterminacy, and so on. This might be a good starting point for\ndescribing what is unique about dreaming while also acknowledging\ncontinuities across sleep-wake states and capitalizing on the\nstrengths of the hallucination, illusion, imagination, and cognitive\nviews.\n",
