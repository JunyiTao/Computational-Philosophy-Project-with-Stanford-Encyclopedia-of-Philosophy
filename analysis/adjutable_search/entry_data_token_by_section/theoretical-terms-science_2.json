    "main_text": "Criticisms and Refinements of the Theory-Observation Distinction || Criticisms\n2.1 Criticisms\n\nThe very idea of a clear-cut theory-observation distinction has\nreceived much criticism. First, with the help of sophisticated\ninstruments, such as telescopes and electron microscopes, we are able\nto observe more and more entities, which had to be considered\nunobservable at a previous stage of scientific and technical\nevolution. Electrons and \\(\\alpha\\)-particles which can be observed in\na cloud chamber are a case in point (Achinstein 1965). Second, assume\nobservability is understood as excluding the use of instruments. On\nthis understanding, examples drawing on the use of cloud chambers and\nelectron microscopes, which are adduced to criticize the\ntheory-observation distinction, can be dealt with. However, we would\nthen have to conclude that things being perceived with glasses are not\nobserved either, which is counterintuitive (Maxwell 1962). Third,\nthere are concepts applying to or being thought to apply to both\nmacroscopic and submicroscopic particles. A case in point are spatial\nand temporal relations and the color concepts that play an important\nrole in Newton\u2019s corpuscle theory of light. Hence, there are\nclear-cut instances of observation concepts that apply to unobservable\nentities, which does not seem acceptable (cf. Putnam 1962).\n\nThese objections to the theory-observation distinction can be answered\nin a relatively straightforward manner from a Carnapian perspective.\nAs explained in\n Section 1.1,\n Carnap (1936/37, 1966) was quite explicit that the\nphilosopher\u2019s sense of observation excludes the use of\ninstruments. As for an observer wearing glasses, a proponent of the\ntheory-observation distinction finds enough material in Carnap\n(1936/37: 455) to defend her position. Carnap is aware of the fact\nthat color concepts are not observable ones for a color-blind person.\nHe is thus prepared to relativize the distinction in question. In\nfact, Carnap\u2019s most explicit explanation of observability\ndefines this notion in such a way that it is relativized to an\norganism (1936/37: 454n).\n\nRecall, moreover, that Carnap\u2019s theory-observation distinction\nwas not intended to do justice to our overall understanding of these\nnotions. Hence, certain quotidian and scientific uses of\n\u2018observation\u2019, such as observation using glasses, may well\nbe disregarded when this distinction is drawn as long as the\ndistinction promises to be fruitful in the logical analysis of\nscientific theories. A closer look reveals that Carnap (1966: 226)\nagrees with critics of the logical empiricists\u2019 agenda, such as\nMaxwell (1962) and Achinstein (1965), on there being no clear-cut\ntheory-observation distinction (see also Carnap\u2019s early\n(1936/37: 455) for a similar statement):\n\n\nThere is no question here of who [the physicist thinking that\ntemperature is observable or the philosopher who disagrees, H. A.] is\nusing the term \u2018observable\u2019 in the right or proper way.\nThere is a continuum which starts with direct sensory observations and\nproceeds to enormously complex, indirect methods of observation.\nObviously no sharp line can be drawn across this continuum; it is a\nmatter of degree.\n\n\nA bit more serious is Putnam\u2019s (1962) objection drawing on the\napplication of apparently clear-cut instances of observation concepts\nto submicroscopic particles. Here, Carnap would have to distinguish\nbetween color concepts applying to observable entities and related\ncolor concepts applying to unobservable ones. So, the formal language\nin which the logical analysis proceeds would have to contain a\npredicate \u2018red\\(_1\\)\u2019 applying to macroscopic objects and\nanother one \u2018red\\(_2\\)\u2019 applying to submicroscopic ones.\nAgain, such a move would be in line with the artificial, or ideal\nlanguage philosophy that Carnap advocated (see Lutz (2012) for a\nsympathetic discussion of artificial language philosophy).\n\nThere is another group of criticisms coming from the careful study of\nthe history of science: Hanson (1958), Feyerabend (1962) and Kuhn\n(1962) aimed to show that observation concepts are\ntheory-laden in a manner that makes their meaning\ntheory-dependent. Feyerabend\u2019s (1978: 32), for example, held\nthat all terms are theoretical. Hanson (1958: 18) thinks that Tycho\nand Kepler were (literally) \u2018seeing\u2019 different things when\nperceiving the sun rising because their astronomical background\ntheories were different. Kuhn (1962) was more tentative when\nexpounding his variant of the theory-ladenness of observation. In a\ndiscussion of the Sneed formalism of the structuralist school, he\nfavored a theory-observation distinction that is relativized, first to\na theory and second to an application of this theory (Kuhn 1976).\n\nVirtually all formal accounts of theoretical terms in fact assume that\nthose phenomena which a theory T is meant to account for can\nbe described in terms of expressions whose meaning does not depend on\nT. The counter-thesis that the meaning of putative\nobservation terms depends on a quotidian or scientific theory,\ntherefore, attacks a core doctrine in the logical empiricists\u2019\nand subsequent work on theoretical terms. A thorough discussion and\nassessment of theory-ladenness of observation in the works of the\ngreat historians of science is beyond the scope of this entry. Bird\n(2004), Bogen (2012) and Oberheim and Hoyningen-Huene (2009) are\nentries in the present encyclopedia that address, among other things,\nthis issue. Schurz (2013: ch. 2.9) defines a criterion of the theory\nindependence of observation in terms of an ostensive learning\nexperiment, and shows how such a criterion helps answer the challenges\nof theory-ladenness of observation.\n",
