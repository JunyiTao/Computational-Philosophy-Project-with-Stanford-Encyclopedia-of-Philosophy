    "main_text": "Historical Accounts of Exploitation || Marx\u2019s Theory of Exploitation\n1.2 Marx\u2019s Theory of Exploitation\n\nBy far the most influential theory of exploitation ever set forth is\nthat of Karl Marx, who held that workers in a capitalist society are\nexploited insofar as they are forced to sell their labor power to\ncapitalists for less than the full value of the commodities they\nproduce with their labor.\n\nFor Marx, however, exploitation was a phenomenon that characterized\nall class-based societies, not only capitalism. Indeed, it is\nfeudal society, not capitalism, where the exploitative nature of class\nrelations is clearest. Under feudalism, it is readily apparent that\nserfs use some of their labor power for their own benefit, while\nanother part (the corv\u00e9e) is used for the benefit of\nthe feudal lord. In contrast, under slavery workers appear to\nwork entirely for the benefit of their masters (though in reality a\npart of their labor goes toward providing for their own subsistence).\nAnd under capitalism workers appear to work entirely for the\nbenefit of themselves, selling their labor to capitalists as free\nindependent contractors (Cohen 1978: 332\u20133).\n\nIn reality, Marx thought, workers\u2019 labor under capitalism is\nneither truly voluntary nor entirely for the benefit of the workers\nthemselves. It is not truly voluntary because workers are\nforced by their lack of ownership of the means of production\nto sell their labor power to capitalists or else starve. And workers\nare not laboring entirely for their own benefit because capitalists\nuse their privileged position to exploit workers,\nappropriating for themselves some of the value created by\nworkers\u2019 labor.\n\nTo understand Marx\u2019s charge of exploitation, it is first\nnecessary to understand Marx\u2019s analysis of market prices, which\nhe largely inherited from earlier classical economists such as Adam\nSmith and David Ricardo. Under capitalism, Marx argued, workers\u2019\nlabor power is treated as a commodity. And because Marx subscribed to\na labor theory of value, this means that just like any other commodity\nsuch as butter or corn, the price (or wage) of labor power is\ndetermined by its cost of production\u2014specifically, by the\nquantity of socially necessary labor required to produce it. The cost\nof producing labor power is the value or labor-cost required for the\nconservation and reproduction of a worker\u2019s labor power. In\nother words, Marx thought that workers under capitalism will therefore\nbe paid just enough to cover the bare necessities of living. They will\nbe paid subsistence wages.\n\nBut while labor power is just like any other commodity in terms of how\nits price is determined, it is unique in one very importance respect.\nLabor, and labor alone, according to Marx, has the capacity to\nproduce value beyond that which is necessary for its own\nreproduction. In other words, the value that goes into the commodities\nthat sustain a worker for a twelve-hour work day is less than the\nvalue of the commodities that worker can produce during those\ntwelve hours. This difference between the value a worker produces in a\ngiven period of time and the value of the consumption goods necessary\nto sustain the worker for that period is what Marx called surplus\nvalue.\n\nAccording to Marx, then, it is as though the worker\u2019s day is\nsplit into two parts. During the first part, the laborer works for\nhimself, producing commodities the value of which is equal to the\nvalue of the wages he receives. During the second part, the laborer\nworks for the capitalist, producing surplus value for the capitalist\nfor which he receives no equivalent wages. During this second part of\nthe day, the laborer\u2019s work is, in effect, unpaid, in precisely\nthe same way (though not as visibly) as a feudal serf\u2019s\ncorv\u00e9e is unpaid (Marx 1867).\n\nCapitalist exploitation thus consists in the forced appropriation by\ncapitalists of the surplus value produced by workers. Workers under\ncapitalism are compelled by their lack of ownership of the means of\nproduction to sell their labor power to capitalists for less than the\nfull value of the goods they produce. Capitalists, in turn, need not\nproduce anything themselves but are able to live instead off the\nproductive energies of workers. And the surplus value that capitalists\nare thereby able to appropriate from workers becomes the source of\ncapitalist profit, thereby \u201cstrengthening that very power whose\nslave it is\u201d (Marx 1847: 40).\n\nIn the first volume of Capital, Marx presents a series of\nformulas representing a tight relationship between labor,\nexploitation, and capitalist profit. According to Marx, the value of a\ncommodity is a function of three factors: constant capital (\\(C\\)),\ni.e., the labor value of nonlabor means of production such as\nmachines, buildings, and raw materials; variable capital (\\(V\\)),\ni.e., the labor value of the labor power of workers involved in\nproduction), and surplus value (\\(S\\)). Since surplus value comes from\nthe exploitation of labor (rather than machines or land), Marx defined\nthe rate of exploitation as the ratio of surplus value over\nvariable capital \\((S/V)\\). Of course, different industries will\nemploy different mixes of labor and other factors of\nproduction\u2014of variable and constant capital. Marx referred to\nthis mixture as the organic composition of capital, and\ndefined it as \\(C/V\\). But since capitalist profit is generated by the\nexploitation of labor, it seems to follow that industries that employ\na greater proportion of labor (of variable over constant capital)\nshould therefore earn a higher rate of profit. Thus, Marx defined the\nrate of profit as \\((S/(C+V))\\), which is equivalent to the\nrate of exploitation divided by the organic composition of\n\\(\\textrm{capital} + 1\\). This last proposition has been referred to\nby Jon Elster as the \u201cfundamental equation of Marxian\neconomics\u201d (Elster 1986a: 67).\n\nMarx\u2019s analysis of the rate of profit seems to entail that\nlabor-intensive industries will be more profitable than industries\nthat rely to a greater extent on constant capital. But this conclusion\nis clearly empirically false (B\u00f6hm-Bawerk 1898), and moreover\nincompatible with Marx\u2019s assumption of a competitive economy in\nwhich investments will adjust so as to equalize the rate of profit\nbetween industries (Arnold 1990: Ch. 3; Buchanan 1985: Ch. 3). Marx\nhimself recognized this fact, and sought to address it in the third\nvolume of Capital by dropping the assumption of volume 1 that\nvalue and price are equivalent, and showing instead\nhow value can be transformed into price through some more\ncomplicated process. Whether Marx\u2019s attempted solution to this\n\u201ctransformation problem\u201d was successful, however, is a\nmatter of great controversy (Arnold 1990: Ch. 3; Samuelson 1971;\nKliman 2007).\n\nMarx\u2019s theory of exploitation appears to presuppose that labor\nis the source of all value. But the labor theory of value to which\nMarx and early classical economists subscribed is subject to a number\nof apparently insurmountable difficulties, and has largely been\nabandoned by economists in the wake of the marginalist revolution of\nthe 1870s. The most obvious difficulty stems from the fact that labor\nis heterogeneous. Some labor is skilled, some labor is unskilled, and\nthere does not appear to be any satisfactory way of reducing the\nformer to the latter and thereby establishing a single standard of\nmeasure for the value of commodities. Moreover, the labor theory of\nvalue appears to be unable to account for the economic value of\ncommodities such as land and raw materials that are not and could not\nbe produced by any human labor. Finally, and perhaps most fatally,\nMarx\u2019s assumption that labor has the unique power to create\nsurplus value is entirely ungrounded. As Robert Paul Wolff has argued,\nMarx\u2019s focus on labor appears to be entirely arbitrary. A\nformally identical theory of value could be constructed with\nany commodity taking the place of labor, and thus a\n\u201ccorn theory of value\u201d would be just as legitimate, and\njust as unhelpful, as Marx\u2019s labor theory of value (Wolff 1981).\nTherefore, if, as some have alleged, Marx\u2019s theory of\nexploitation is dependent on the truth of the labor theory of value,\nthen a rejection of the labor theory of value should entail a\nrejection of Marx\u2019s theory of exploitation as well (Nozick 1974;\nArnold 1990).\n\nNot everyone agrees, however, that Marx\u2019s theory is\ndependent on the labor theory of value in this way. G.A. Cohen, for\ninstance, argues that Marx\u2019s theory of exploitation is not only\nindependent of the labor theory of value, but incompatible\nwith it (Cohen 1979: 345\u20136). Marx\u2019s account of\nexploitation is premised on the claim that value created by workers is\nappropriated by capitalists. But the labor theory of value holds that\nthe value of an object is a function of the labor that would be\ncurrently required to produce it, regardless of how much\nlabor actually went into producing it. Paradoxical as it may seem, the\nlabor theory of value is incompatible with the claim that labor alone\ncreates value.\n\nThe real problem with exploitation, on Cohen\u2019s view, is not that\ncapitalists appropriate value that is created by labor. It\nis, rather, that capitalists appropriate some of the value of the\nproducts that are created by labor. Labor may not produce\nvalue, but it is the only thing that produces what has value,\nand this is all Marx needs to get his account of exploitation off the\nground (Cohen 1979: 354).\n\nBut even if Cohen\u2019s account of exploitation avoids commitment to\nthe labor theory of value, it nevertheless remains committed to the\nMarxian idea that exploitation should be understood as the forced\nappropriation of surplus value. And there are at least two respects in\nwhich this commitment is problematic. First, it is unclear whether\nexploitation necessarily involves the forced transfer of\nsurplus value. Marx\u2019s account asserts that the laborer is forced\nto work for capitalists because the only alternative is starvation.\nBut suppose the government provides a safety net sufficient to ensure\nthat workers\u2019 subsistence needs are met. If someone chooses to\nwork in order to earn discretionary income, it still seems possible\nthat they could be exploited by a capitalist who appropriates some of\nthe value of the product the laborer creates (Kymlicka 2002: 179). A\nlaborer can be exploited, we might think, by being paid an\nunfair wage even if that laborer is not forced to\nwork.\n\nSecond, it is unclear whether all cases involving the forced transfer\nof surplus value are necessarily exploitative, at least in the\nordinary sense of involving a moral wrong. Suppose that governments\ntax workers and use some of the proceeds to provide support for\nchildren or the infirm. If it is exploitative for capitalists to\nappropriate some of the value of the objects produced by workers, is\nit not also exploitative for government to do so through the mechanism\nof taxation? Some libertarians have argued that this is precisely how\nwe should understand the coercive power of government. For Cohen,\nhowever, the fact that Marx\u2019s account of exploitation appears to\nbe committed to the libertarian idea of that workers own their labor\nand the products they produce with that labor\u2014that is, to the\nlibertarian idea of self-ownership\u2014is deeply problematic (Cohen\n1995: Ch. 6).\n",
