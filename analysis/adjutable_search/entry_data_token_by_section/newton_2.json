    "main_text": "Newton's Life || Newton's Years at Cambridge Prior to Principia\n1.2 Newton's Years at Cambridge Prior to Principia\n\n\nNewton's initial education at Cambridge was classical, focusing\n(primarily through secondary sources) on Aristotlean rhetoric, logic,\nethics, and physics. By 1664, Newton had begun reaching beyond the\nstandard curriculum, reading, for example, the 1656 Latin edition of\nDescartes's Opera philosophica, which included the\nMeditations, Discourse on Method, the\nDioptrics, and the Principles of Philosophy. By\nearly 1664 he had also begun teaching himself mathematics, taking\nnotes on works by Oughtred, Vi\u00e8te, Wallis, and Descartes\n\u2014 the latter via van Schooten's Latin translation, with\ncommentary, of the G\u00e9om\u00e9trie. Newton spent all\nbut three months from the summer of 1665 until the spring of 1667 at\nhome in Woolsthorpe when the university was closed because of the\nplague.  This period was his so-called annus\nmirabilis. During it, he made his initial experimental\ndiscoveries in optics and developed (independently of Huygens's\ntreatment of 1659) the mathematical theory of uniform circular motion,\nin the process noting the relationship between the inverse-square and\nKepler's rule relating the square of the planetary periods to the cube\nof their mean distance from the Sun. Even more impressively, by late\n1666 he had become de facto the leading mathematician in the\nworld, having extended his earlier examination of cutting-edge\nproblems into the discovery of the calculus, as presented in his tract\nof October 1666. He returned to Trinity as a Fellow in 1667, where he\ncontinued his research in optics, constructing his first reflecting\ntelescope in 1669, and wrote a more extended tract on the calculus\n\u201cDe Analysi per \u00c6quations Numero Terminorum\nInfinitas\u201d incorporating new work on infinite series. On the\nbasis of this tract Isaac Barrow recommended Newton as his replacement\nas Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, a position he assumed in October\n1669, four and a half years after he had received his Bachelor of\nArts.\n\n\nOver the course of the next fifteen years as Lucasian Professor Newton\npresented his lectures and carried on research in a variety of\nareas. By 1671 he had completed most of a treatise length account\nof the\n calculus,[2]\nwhich he then found no one would publish. This failure appears to have\ndiverted his interest in mathematics away from the calculus for some\ntime, for the mathematical lectures he registered during this period\nmostly concern algebra. (During the early 1680s he undertook a\ncritical review of classical texts in geometry, a review that reduced\nhis view of the importance of symbolic mathematics.)  His lectures\nfrom 1670 to 1672 concerned optics, with a large range of experiments\npresented in detail. Newton went public with his work in optics in\nearly 1672, submitting material that was read before the Royal Society\nand then published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal\nSociety. This led to four years of exchanges with various figures\nwho challenged his claims, including both Robert Hooke and Christiaan\nHuygens \u2014 exchanges that at times exasperated Newton to the\npoint that he chose to withdraw from further public exchanges in\nnatural philosophy. Before he largely isolated himself in the late\n1670s, however, he had also engaged in a series of sometimes long\nexchanges in the mid 1670s, most notably with John Collins (who had a\ncopy of \u201cDe Analysi\u201d) and Leibniz, concerning his work on\nthe calculus. So, though they remained unpublished, Newton's advances\nin mathematics scarcely remained a secret.\n\n\nThis period as Lucasian Professor also marked the beginning of his more\nprivate researches in alchemy and theology. Newton purchased\nchemical apparatus and treatises in alchemy in 1669, with experiments\nin chemistry extending across this entire period. The issue of\nthe vows Newton might have to take in conjunction with the Lucasian\nProfessorship also appears to have precipitated his study of the\ndoctrine of the Trinity, which opened the way to his questioning the\nvalidity of a good deal more doctrine central to the Roman and Anglican\nChurches.\n\n\nNewton showed little interest in orbital astronomy during this period\nuntil Hooke initiated a brief correspondence with him in an effort to\nsolicit material for the Royal Society at the end of November 1679,\nshortly after Newton had returned to Cambridge following the death of\nhis mother. Among the several problems Hooke proposed to Newton\nwas the question of the trajectory of a body under an inverse-square\ncentral force:\n\n\nIt now remaines to know the proprietys of a curve Line (not circular\nnor concentricall) made by a centrall attractive power which makes the\nvelocitys of Descent from the tangent Line or equall straight motion at\nall Distances in a Duplicate proportion to the Distances Reciprocally\ntaken. I doubt not but that by your excellent method you will\neasily find out what the Curve must be, and it proprietys, and suggest\na physicall Reason of this\n proportion.[3]\n\n\nNewton apparently discovered the systematic relationship between\nconic-section trajectories and inverse-square central forces at the\ntime, but did not communicate it to anyone, and for reasons that\nremain unclear did not follow up this discovery until Halley, during a\nvisit in the summer of 1684, put the same question to him. His\nimmediate answer was, an ellipse; and when he was unable to produce\nthe paper on which he had made this determination, he agreed to\nforward an account to Halley in London. Newton fulfilled this\ncommitment in November by sending Halley a nine-folio-page\nmanuscript, \u201cDe Motu Corporum in Gyrum\u201d (\u201cOn the\nMotion of Bodies in Orbit\u201d), which was entered into the Register\nof the Royal Society in early December 1684. The body of this tract\nconsists of ten deduced propositions \u2014 three theorems and seven\nproblems \u2014 all of which, along with their corollaries, recur in\nimportant propositions in the Principia.\n\n\nSave for a few weeks away from Cambridge, from late 1684 until early\n1687, Newton concentrated on lines of research that expanded the short\nten-proposition tract into the 500 page Principia, with its\n192 derived propositions. Initially the work was to have a two\nbook structure, but Newton subsequently shifted to three books, and\nreplaced the original version of the final book with one more\nmathematically demanding. The manuscript for Book 1 was sent to\nLondon in the spring of 1686, and the manuscripts for Books 2 and 3, in\nMarch and April 1687, respectively. The roughly three hundred\ncopies of the Principia came off the press in the summer of\n1687, thrusting the 44 year old Newton into the forefront of natural\nphilosophy and forever ending his life of comparative isolation.\n",
