It\nwould seem that by being the same god, they must be numerically the\nsame entity; \u201cthey\u201d are really one, and so\n\u201cthey\u201d can\u2019t differ in any way (that is, this one\nentity can\u2019t differ from itself). But then, they (really: it)\ncan\u2019t be different divine selves.\n\nRelative identity theorists think there is some mistake in this\nreasoning, so that things may be different somethings yet the same\nsomething else. They hold that the above reasoning falsely assumes\nsomething about numerical sameness. They hold that numerical sameness,\nor identity, either can be or always is relative to a kind or\nconcept.\n\nRelative identity theorists are concerned to rebut this sort of\nargument:\n\nThe Father is God.\nThe Son is God.\nTherefore, the Father is the Son.\n\n\nIf each occurrence of \u201cis\u201d here is interpreted as identity\n(\u201cabsolute\u201d or non-relative identity), then this argument\nis indisputably valid. Things identical to the same thing must also be\nidentical to one another. The relative identity trinitarian argues\nthat one should read the \u201cis\u201d in 1 and 2 as meaning\n\u201cis the same being as\u201d and the \u201cis\u201d in 3 as\nmeaning \u201cis the same divine Person as\u201d. Doing this,\none\u00a0may say that the argument is invalid, having true premises\nbut a false conclusion.\u00a0\n\nThese theorists reject another response to the above argument, which\nwould be to reject it is invalid because 1 and 2 mean that each is a\nmode of God (see section\n 1),\n and while these claims are true, they don\u2019t imply 3,\nsince\u00a0the Father and the Son are two different modes. Against\nthis, the theories of this section assume that the three Persons of\nthe Trinity are three selves (Rea 2009, 406. 419; van Inwagen 1995,\n229\u201331).\u00a0\n\nFollowing Rea (2003) we divide relative identity trinitarian theories\ninto the pure and the impure. Pure theories accept (1) either that\nthere is no such relation as absolute identity or that such statements\nare definable in terms of relative-identity relations, and (2) that\ntrinitarian statements of sameness and difference (e.g. the Father is\nGod, the Father is not the Son) are to be analyzed as involving\nrelative and not absolute identity relations, whereas the impure\ntheories accept only (2), allowing that statements about absolute\nidentity (e.g. a = b) may be both intelligible and true, against (1).\n(434\u20138)\n2.1.1 Pure Relative Identity Theories\n\nPeter Geach (1972, 1973, 1980) argues that it is meaningless to ask\nwhether or not some a and b are \u201cthe same\u201d; rather,\nsameness is relative to a sortal concept. Thus, while it is senseless\nto ask whether or not Paul and Saul are identical, we can ask whether\nor not Paul and Saul are the same human, same person, same apostle,\nsame animal, etc. The doctrine of the Trinity, then, is construed as\nthe claim that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the same\nGod, but are not the same Person. They are\n\u201cGod-identical but Person-distinct\u201d (Rea 2003, 432).\n\nAs Joseph Jedwab explains, traditional Trinity language and\ncommitments\u00a0arguably lead naturally to a relative identity\naccount.\n\nPrima facie, the doctrine of the Trinity implies the sortal\nrelativity of identity thesis, which says that where\n\u201cR\u201d and \u201cS\u201d are sortals, it\ncould be that for some x and y, x and y are the same R but\ndifferent Ss. The Father and the Son are the same God, else\nthey are two Gods, which implies polytheism and so is false. But the\nFather and the Son are different divine Persons, else they are one\ndivine Person, which implies the Sabellian heresy and so is false. So\nthe Father and the Son are the same God but different divine Persons.\n(2015, 124)\n\n\nGeach\u2019s approach to the Trinity is developed by Martinich (1978,\n1979) and Cain (1989). Jedwab (2015) criticizes Cain\u2019s version\nas implying philosophical, theological and christological\ndifficulties. Cain (2016) defends his more Geachian approach.\n\nPure relative identity trinitarianism depends on the controversial\nclaim that there\u2019s no such relation as (non-sortal-relative,\nabsolute) identity. Most philosophers hold, to the contrary, that the\nidentity relation and its logic are well-understood; such are\nexpounded in recent logic text-books, and philosophers frequently\nargue in ways that assume there is such a relation as identity (Baber\n2015, 165; Layman 2016, 141). One might turn to a weaker relative\nidentity doctrine; outside the context of the Trinity, philosopher\nNicholas Griffin (1977; cf. Rea 2003, 435\u20136) has argued that\nwhile there are identity relations, they are not basic, but\nmust be understood in terms of relative identity relations. On either\nview, relative identity relations are fundamental.\n\nIt has been objected to Geach\u2019s claim about the senselessness of\nasking if a and b are (non-relatively) \u201cthe same\u201d\nthat,\n\nGiven that we have succeeded in picking out something by the use of\n\u201ca\u201d and in picking out something by the use of\n\u201cb\u201d it surely is a complete determinate\nproposition that a = b, that is, it is surely either\ntrue or false that the item we have picked out with\n\u201ca\u201d is the item we have picked out with\n\u201cb\u201d. (Alston and Bennett 1984, 558)\n\n\nRea objects that relative identity theory presupposes some sort of\nmetaphysical anti-realism, the controversial doctrine that there is no\nrealm of real objects which exists independently of human thought\n(2003, 435\u20136). Baber replies that such worries are misguided, as\nthe only aim of relative identity theory should be to show a way in\nwhich the Trinity might be coherent (2015, 170).\n\nTrenton Merricks objects that if a and b \u201care the same F\u201d,\nthis implies that a is an F, that b is an F, and that a and b are\n(absolutely, non-relatively) identical. But this widely accepted\nanalysis is precisely what relative identity trinitarians deny. This\nleads to the objection that relative-identity trinitarian claims are\nunintelligible (that is, we have no grasp of what they mean). If\nsomeone asserts that Fluffy and Spike are \u201cthe same dog\u201d\nand denies that they\u2019re both dogs which are one and the same, we\nhave no idea what this person is asserting. Similarly with the claim\nthat Father and Son are \u201cthe same God\u201d but are not\nidentical (Merricks 2006, 301\u20135, 321; cf. Tuggy 2003a,\n173\u20134, Layman 2016, 141\u20132).\n\nBaber (2015) replies that if the sortal dog is\n\u201cdominant\u201d, meaning that for any sortal F, if x and y are\nthe same dog, they will also be the same F, then the claim that Fluffy\nand Spike are the same dog but not absolutely identical is\nintelligible. After all, we can understand that the claim implies that\nFluffy and Spike are the same animal, the same pet, and so on (167).\nThe relative identity trinitarian, Baber says, must hold that\n\u201cBeing does not dominate [i.e. imply sameness with\nrespect to] Person but rather that Person dominates\nBeing\u201d. However, there\u2019s no easy way to prove\nthis, and dominance claims are theory-relative (ibid.). But\nsuch a claim will just be a part of the relative identity\ntheorist\u2019s Trinity theory (169).\n\nOne may also object to either sort of relative identity account being\nthe historical doctrine on the grounds that only those conversant in\nthe logic of the last 120 years or so have ever had a concept of\nrelative identity. But this may be disputed; Anscombe and Geach (1961,\n118) argue that Aquinas should be interpreted along these lines,\nRichard Cartwright (1987, 193) claims to find\u00a0the idea of\nrelative identity in the works of Anselm and in the Eleventh Council\nof Toledo (675 C.E.), and Jeffrey Brower (2006) finds a similar\naccount in the works of Peter Abelard. (On Aquinas, see the\nsupplementary document on the history of trinitarian doctrines\n section 4.)\n Christopher Hughes Conn (2019) argues that Anselm was the first to\nconsciously develop a Trinity theory involving relative identity.\n2.1.2 Impure Relative Identity Theories: A Relative Identity Logic\n\nPeter van Inwagen (1995, 2003) tries to show that there is a set of\npropositions representing a possibly orthodox interpretation of the\n\u201cAthanasian\u201d creed (see section\n 5.3)\n which is demonstrably self-consistent, refuting claims that the\nTrinity doctrine is obviously self-contradictory. He formulates a\ntrinitarian doctrine using a concept of relative identity, without\nemploying the concept of absolute identity or presupposing that there\nis or isn\u2019t such a thing (1995, 241). Specifically, he proves\nthat the following eight claims (understood as involving relative and\nnever absolute identity, the names being read as descriptions)\ndon\u2019t imply a contradiction in his system of relative identity\nlogic.\n\nThere is (exactly) one God.\nThere are (exactly) three divine Persons.\nThere are three divine Persons in one divine Being.\nGod is the same being as the Father.\nGod is a person.\nGod is the same person as the Father.\nGod is the same person as the Son.\nThe Son is not the same person as the Father.\nGod is the same being as the Father. (249, 254)\n\n\nVan Inwagen neither endorses this Trinity theory, nor presumes to\npronounce it orthodox, and he admits that it does little to reduce the\nmysteriousness of the traditional language.\n\nIt may be objected, as to the preceding theory, that van\nInwagen\u2019s relative identity trinitarianism is unintelligible.\nMerricks argues that this problem is more acute for van Inwagen than\nfor Geach, as the former declines to adopt Geach\u2019s claim that\nall assertions of identity, in all domains of discourse, and in\neveryday life, are sortal-relative (Merricks 2006, 302\u20134).\n\nMichael Rea (2003) objects that by remaining neutral on the issue of\nidentity, van Inwagen\u2019s theory allows that the three Persons are\n(absolutely) non-identical, in which case \u201cit is hard to see\nwhat it could possibly mean to say that they are the same\nbeing\u201d (Rea 2003, 441). It seems that any things which are\nnon-identical are not the same being. Thus, van Inwagen must\nassume that there is absolute identity, and deny that this relation\nholds between the Persons. Thus, van Inwagen has not demonstrated the\nconsistency of (this version of) trinitarianism. Further, the theory\ndoesn\u2019t rule out polytheism, as it doesn\u2019t deny that there\nare non-identical divine beings. In sum, the impure relative identity\ntrinitarian owes us a plausible and orthodox metaphysical story about\nhow non-identical beings may nonetheless be \u201cone God\u201d, and\nvan Inwagen hasn\u2019t done this, staying as he has in the realm of\nlogic (Rea 2003, 441\u20132).\n\nIn a later discussion, van Inwagen goes farther, claiming that\ntrinitarian doctrine is inconsistent \u201cif the standard logic of\nidentity is correct\u201d, and denying there is any \u201crelation\nthat is both universally reflexive [i.e., everything bears the\nrelation to itself] and forces indiscernibility [i.e. things standing\nin the relation can\u2019t differ]\u201d (2003, 92). Thus,\nthere\u2019s no such relation as classical or absolute identity, but\nthere are instead only various relative identity relations\n(92\u20133). In so doing he moves to a \u201cpure\u201d relative\nidentity approach to the Trinity, as described in section\n 2.1.1.\n\nMany philosophers would object that whatever reason there is to\nbelieve in the Trinity, it is more obvious that there\u2019s\nsuch a relation as identity, that the indiscernibility of identicals\nis true, and that we do successfully use singular referring terms.\n\nVlastimil Voh\u00e1nka (2013) argues that van Inwagen has done\nnothing to show the logical possibility of any Trinity theory. Just\nbecause a set of claims can\u2019t be proven inconsistent in van\nInwagen\u2019s relative identity logic, it doesn\u2019t follow that\nsuch claims don\u2019t imply a contradiction, or that it is\nmetaphysically possible that all the claims are true. At one point van\nInwagen tells a short non-theological story whose claims, when\ntranslated into his relative identity logic, have the same forms as\nthe Trinity propositions. The story, he argues, is clearly not\nself-contradictory; thus, he concludes, neither are the Trinity\npropositions, since they have the same logical forms. In response,\nVoh\u00e1nka concocts a short non-theological story whose claims\ntranslate into claims of the same form in relative identity logic, and\nyet are clearly logically impossible (207\u201311). He\nconcludes that \u201cthere\u2019s no ground for thinking that formal\nconsistency in [relative identity logic] guarantees logical\npossibility\u201d, and that \u201csharing a form in [relative\nidentity logic] with a logically possible proposition does not\nguarantee logical possibility\u201d (211\u20132).\n2.1.3 Impure Relative Identity Theories: Constitution Trinitarianism\n\nAnother theory claims to possess the sort of metaphysical story van\nInwagen\u2019s theory lacks. Based on the concept of constitution,\nRea and Brower develop a three-self Trinity theory according to which\neach of the divine Persons is non-identical to the others, as well as\nto God, but is nonetheless \u201cnumerically the same\u201d as all\nof them (Brower and Rea 2005a; Rea 2009, 2011). They employ an analogy\nbetween the Christian God and material objects. When we look at a\nbronze statue of Athena, we should say that we\u2019re viewing one\nmaterial object. Yet, we can distinguish the lump of bronze from the\nstatue. These cannot be identical, as they differ (e.g., the lump\ncould, but the statue couldn\u2019t survive being smashed flat). We\nshould say that the lump and statue stand in a relation of\n\u201caccidental sameness\u201d. This means that they needn\u2019t\nbe, but in fact are \u201cnumerically the same\u201d without being\nidentical. While they are numerically one physical object, they are\ntwo hylomorphic compounds, that is, two compounds of form and matter,\nsharing their matter. This, they hold, is a plausible solution to the\nproblem of material constitution (Rea 1995).\n\nSimilarly, the Persons of the Trinity are so many selves constituted\nby the same stuff (or something analogous to a stuff). These selves,\nlike the lump and statue, are numerically the same without being\nidentical, but they don\u2019t stand in a relation of\naccidental sameness, as they could not fail to be related in\nthis way. Father, Son, and Spirit are three quasi form-matter\ncompounds. The forms are properties like \u201cbeing the Father,\nbeing the Son, and being the Spirit; or perhaps being Unbegotten,\nbeing Begotten and Proceeding\u201d (Rea 2009, 419). The single\nsubject of those properties is \u201csomething that plays the role of\nmatter,\u201d which Rea calls \u201cthe divine essence\u201d or\n\u201cthe divine nature\u201d (Brower and Rea 2005a, 68; Rea 2009,\n420). Whereas in the earlier discussion \u201cthe divine essence [is]\nnot\u2026 an individual thing in its own right\u201d (Brower and\nRea 2005a, 68; cf. Craig 2005, 79), in a later piece, Rea holds the\ndivine nature to be a substance (i.e. an entity, an individual being),\nand moreover \u201cnumerically the same\u201d substance as each of\nthe three. Thus, it isn\u2019t a fourth substance; nor is it a fourth\ndivine Person, as it isn\u2019t, like each of the three, a\nform-(quasi-)matter compound, but only something analogous to a lump\nof matter, something which constitutes each of the Three (Rea 2009,\n420; Rea 2011, Section 6). Rea adds that this divine nature is a\nfundamental power which is sharable and multiply locatable. He\ndoesn\u2019t say whether it is either universal or particular,\nsaying, \u201cI am unsure whether I buy into the universal/particular\ndistinction\u201d (Rea 2011, Section 6). All properties, in his view,\nare powers, and vice versa. Thus, this divine nature is both a power\nand a property, and it plays a role like that of matter in the\nTrinity.\n\nThis three-self theory may be illustrated as follows (Tuggy 2013a,\n134).\n\n\n\n\nThere would seem to be seven realities here, none of which is\n(absolutely) identical to any of the others. Four of them are\nproperties: the divine nature (d), being unbegotten (u), being\nbegotten (b), and proceeding (p). Three are hylomorphic (form-matter)\ncompounds: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (f, s, h)\u2013each with the\nproperty d playing the role of matter within it, and each having its\nown additional property (respectively: u, b, and p) playing the role\nof form within it. Each of these compounds is a divine self. The ovals\ncan be taken to represent the three hylomorphs (form-matter compounds)\nor the three hylomorphic compounding relations which obtain among the\nseven realities posited. Three of these seven (f, s, h) are to be\ncounted as one god, because they are hylomorphs with only one divine\nnature (d) between them. Thus, of the seven items, three are\nproperties (u, b, p), three are substances which are hylomorphic\ncompounds (f, s, h), and one is both a property and a substance, but a\nsimple substance, not a compound one (d).\n\nBrower and Rea argue that their theory stands a better chance of being\northodox than its competitors, and point out that a part of their\nmotivation is that leading medieval trinitarians such as Augustine,\nAnselm, and Aquinas say things which seem to require a concept of\nnumerical sameness without identity. (See Marenbon 2007, Brower 2005,\nand the supplementary document on the history of Trinity theories,\nsections\n 3.3.2,\n on Augustine, and\n 4.1,\n on Thomas Aquinas.)\n\nIn contrast to other relative-identity theories, this theory seems\nwell-motivated, for its authors can point to something outside\ntrinitarian theology which requires the controversial concept of\nnumerical sameness without identity. This concept, they can argue, was\nnot concocted solely to acquit the trinitarian of inconsistency. But\nthis strength is also its weakness, for on the level of metaphysics,\nmuch hostility to the theory is due to the fact that philosophers are\nheavily divided on the reality, nature, and metaphysical utility of\nconstitution. Thus, some philosophers deny that a metaphysics of\nmaterial objects should involve constitution, since strictly speaking\nthere are no statues or pillars, for these apparent objects should be\nunderstood as mere modes of the particles that compose them. Arguably,\ntruths about statues and pillars supervene on truths about\narrangements of particles (Byerly 2019, 82\u20133).\n\nThis Constitution theory has been criticized as underdeveloped,\nunclear in its aims, unintelligible, incompatible with self-evident\ntruths, unorthodox relative to Roman Catholicism, polytheistic and not\nmonotheistic, not truly trinitarian, involving too many divine\nindividuals (primary substances), out of step with the broad\nhistorical catholic tradition, implying that the Persons of the\nTrinity can\u2019t simultaneously differ in non-modal and\nnon-temporal properties, not a theological improvement over simpler\nrelative identity approaches, and as wrongly implying that terms like\n\u201cGod\u201d are systematically ambiguous (Craig 2005; Hasker\n2010b; Hughes 2009; Layman 2016; Leftow 2018; Pruss 2009, Tuggy\n2013a).\n2.1.4 Impure Relative Identity Theories: Constitution and Indexicals\n\nScott Williams has constructed a similar theory, which he calls a\n\u201cLatin Social\u201d account. In common with Leftow\u2019s\n\u201cLatin\u201d theory and Hasker\u2019s \u201cSocial\u201d\ntheory (see sections\n 1.5,\n 2.4), Williams says that there is one \u201cconcrete\ninstance or trope of the divine nature\u201d which is a constituent\nof each Person. Each Person is also constituted by an incommunicable\nattribute, begetting (Father), being begotten (Son), and being\nspirated (Spirit) (Williams 2017, 324). He understands each Person to\nbe \u201can incommunicable existence of an intellectual nature\u201d\n(326). In his view any person is a person \u201contologically and\nexplanatorily prior to any cognitive acts of volitions that\nthat person in question has or might have\u201d (Williams\n2017, 327; cf. 2013, 2019). And for him, the Persons are persons. Each\nPerson is essentially numerically the same essence as the one divine\nessence, while being a numerically different Person from the other two\nPersons. Thus, the account involves irreducible relations of\nkind-relative numerical sameness. But the divine Persons are not\n(absolutely) numerically identical to one another, and each is not\n(absolutely) numerically identical to the divine essence. This divine\nessence is like an Aristotelian first substance in that it exists on\nits own (not in another) and in being a concrete particular, but\nunlike first substances it is communicable, in other words, it can be\nshared by non-identical things, the divine Persons (Williams 2017,\n326). The term \u201cGod\u201d can refer to any of the Persons, or\nto the divine essence. The term \u201cTrinity\u201d is a\nplural-referring term which refers to the plurality of the divine\nPersons (Williams 2013, 85). (See section\n 5.1.)\n\nWilliams considers it an axiom of trinitarian theorizing that\n\u201cthe divine persons are necessarily unified or necessarily agree\nregarding all things\u201d (2017, 321). Some rival theories try to\naccount for this \u201cnecessary agreement thesis\u201d by showing\nhow, allegedly, the Persons would have to come up with some policy\nwhich would prevent disagreement. Williams finds such claims\n\u201cphilosophically unsatisfying\u201d, and instead argues that\nthe three Persons can never disagree because they have numerically one\nwill, one power of choosing (322). Unlike any other three persons, the\nPersons of the Trinity, because they share one divine nature, share\none set of powers, and so any exercise of any divine power belongs to\neach of the three. In this case, Williams analyzes thinking as\nproducing and using a token sentence in what we might call divine\nmentalese. Building on work by philosopher John Perry on indexical\nterms like \u201cI\u201d, Williams points out that a single token of\na sentence in English may be used by different agents, and may thus\nhave multiple meanings. For example,\n\nSuppose that Peter produces\u2026a sign that reads,\u00a0\u201cI am\nhappy,\u201d and\u00a0that\u00a0Peter\nuses\u00a0this\u00a0sign\u00a0by holding\u00a0it up.\nPeter\u00a0affirms\u00a0that\u00a0Peter\u00a0is happy.\u00a0Later,\nPeter puts the sign on the ground and Paul picks up\u00a0the\nsame\u00a0sign and holds it up such\u00a0that\u00a0Paul affirms that\nPaul is happy. Paul uses\u00a0numerically the same token as Peter did,\nyet\u00a0when\u00a0Paul uses it he\u00a0affirms\nsomething\u00a0different than Peter. (Williams 2013, 81)\n\n\nSimilarly, if divine Persons think using a language-like divine\nmentalese, then one token of this may be used by different Persons and\nhave a different significance for each. The idea is that a person\nrelates to a proposition (the content of his thought) by means of a\ntoken sentence which he produces and uses to think. But these mental\nacts, given that the Persons share one set of powers, must be shared\nby all three of them. Yet, the thoughts thereby thought will differ.\nFor example,\n\n\u2026if the Father uses a mental token of \u201cI am God the\nFather\u201d and in so doing affirms a proposition, then the Father\naffirms that God the Father is identical to God the Father. If the Son\nuses the same mental token of \u201cI am God the\nFather\u201d\u2026the Son affirms the proposition that the Son is\nessentially numerically the same divine nature as the Father without\nbeing identical to the Father. (Williams 2017, 331)\n\n\nThis account denies what some philosophers assume to be obvious, that\n\u201cdistinct and incommunicable intellectual acts and volitional\nacts are necessary conditions for being a person\u201d (339).\nWilliams rejects this as an ungrounded modern assumption. While it\nemploys recent thinking about indexical terms and other matters,\nWilliams considers this account to fit well with historical\ntheologians such as Gregory of Nyssa, Henry of Ghent, and John Duns\nScotus (345). That the persons share all mental acts does not imply\nthat they share one mind or that there is one consciousness in the\nTrinity. Rather, the access consciousness, experiential consciousness,\nand introspective consciousness of each Person may differ (2020,\nSection 3).\n\nA New Testament reader might question the assumption that the Persons\nof the Trinity can\u2019t disagree, given the temptation of the Son\n(but not of the Father) and an occasion when the Son asked the Father\nto be excused from a difficult trial (Matthew 4:1\u201311; James\n1:13; Mark 14:36).\n\nIn a response, William Hasker objects that it seems that sometimes\nhuman beings can think without using any language. Why, then, should\nwe suppose divine Persons to think only by means of mental token\nsentences? Perhaps they can just relate directly to propositions (the\ncontents of their thoughts). Worse, Williams posits that this divine\nmental language is ambiguous, but Hasker says, \u201cwe would\nnaturally expect a divine language of thought to be very precise\nindeed, perhaps maximally so\u201d (Hasker 2018b, 364). He also\nobjects that the theory wrongly counts mental acts. Hasker imagines\nthat the Holy Spirit intends to become incarnate on some other planet,\nand that before this Incarnation or the Incarnation of the Son, the\nthree of them together produce the mental token \u201cI shall become\nincarnate\u201d. Hasker urges that this seems to be two uses of the\nsame mental sentence, one by the Son and the other by the Spirit.\n\u201cTo be aware of a proposition is precisely to perform a mental\nact,\u201d and here the Son is aware of one, but the Spirit is aware\nof another (365). But this clashes with Williams\u2019s claim that\nthere is but one mental power shared by the three.\n\nWilliams replies that divine mental tokens are needed \u201cto\nexplain why a divine person\u2019s mental act is directed at (among\nall possible propositions) the proposition it is directed at\u201d\n(Williams 2020, 115). Williams denies that ambiguity is always an\nimperfection of a language, and urges that there is nothing\nobjectionable about divine Persons using mental tokens that can be\nused to express various propositions (110\u20131). About\nHasker\u2019s allegation that the theory mis-counts the mental acts\nof the Persons, Williams says that to the contrary, we should see but\none mental act here, though we should keep in mind the Persons\u2019\nbackground knowledge about who will become incarnate, which provides\nthe contexts relative to which the one token mental sentence means\ndifferent things. Moreover, \u201cWhy posit several mental acts here,\nwhen one mental act will do the same explanatory work?\u201d Finally,\nWilliams clarifies that the necessary sharing of divine acts does not\napply to \u201cinternal divine productions\u201d, such as the\nFather\u2019s eternal generation of the Son (111\u20134,\n115\u20136).\n2.1.5 Impure Relative Identity Theories: Episodic Personhood\n\nAnother relative identity theory by Justin Mooney (2020) depends on an\nentirely different metaphysical account to show how multiple persons\nmay each be the same being. Metaphysician Ned Markosian proposes a\nthought experiment in which a man dies and is mummified, and then a\nlong time later the mummy\u2019s parts are re-arranged into a living\nwoman who has an utterly different psychology than the dead man. The\npoint is that the woman is the same object as the man but is not the\nsame person as the man, because the instances of personhood in his\nlife aren\u2019t part of the same episode of personhood (3\u20134).\nMooney applies Markosian\u2019s ideas about \u201cidentity under a\nsortal\u201d to the Trinity. On this account, \u201cGod is a single,\ndivine substance that is simultaneously or atemporally participating\nin three distinct episodes of personhood\u2013those of the Father,\nSon, and Spirit\u201d (5). Thus, each Person just is God, but none is\nthe same Person as any other divine Person. The account may be\nillustrated by modifying the traditional Trinity shield:\n\n\n\n\nOn this theory, being different Persons doesn\u2019t imply being\nnumerically distinct.\n\nOne may worry that such Persons must be one and the same Person since\nthey have but one substance between them, but Mooney answers that they\nare individuated by their causal relationships, following Swinburne\n(1994) (5). In addition, following Effingham, he says that they are\nnot one and the same Person because they aren\u2019t linked by\nimmanent causal relations. (5\u20136) These are \u201cthose causal\nlinks an entity bears to itself from one time to another whereby the\nway it is earlier on causes how it is later on\u201d\u00a0(Effingham\n2015, 35).\u00a0Following Moreland and Craig (2017), Mooney adds that\nGod possesses three mental faculties, each had by one of the Persons\n(6). Finally, adapting ideas from Swinburne (1994), he says that\n\n\u2026the Father\u2019s episode of personhood occurs simply because\nGod is a divine being, and a divine being is essentially a personal\nbeing. By nature, God instantiates whatever psychological properties\nare necessary for being a person. The Son\u2019s episode of\npersonhood occurs because the Father wills that there is an\ninstantiation of personhood by the divine substance which is not\nimmanent-causally linked to the Father\u2019s instantiation of\npersonhood. And the Spirit\u2019s episode occurs because one or both\nof these persons will(s) that there is yet another instantiation of\npersonhood by the divine substance which is not connected by immanent\ncausal relations to either the Father\u2019s or the Son\u2019s\ninstantiation of personhood (6).\n\n\nHe remains neutral on whether this process is either\u00a0temporal or\nnecessary (ibid.).\n\nUnlike other relative identity theories, this account, like some\none-self theories, affirms the absolute identity of each Person with\nGod; each is the same thing or being or primary substance, God (7).\nThis generates a concern that the account may count as a heretical\nmodalism. Mooney replies that \u201cif Markosian\u2019s episodic\nview of personal identity is right, the model is not modalist\u201d\n(ibid.). The reason is that on this account there are three\nepisodes of personhood, which implies that there are three Persons,\neven though there is one being which is the component thing in each\nepisode, a single subject of the properties that are involved in being\na Person.\n\nEven though the account has it that these three are different Persons,\nstill, it identifies each with God, which entails their identity with\none another; being the same thing as God, they must be the same thing\nas each other. Given this, it would seem that they can\u2019t differ\nin any way, e.g. the Son becomes incarnate but the Father does not\n(7). Mooney replies that the Trinity is mysterious, and that probably\na sentence like \u201cThe Son became incarnate but the Father\ndidn\u2019t\u201d might be understood as not requiring a\nsimultaneous or eternal difference between the being that is the Son\nand the one which is the Father. In Markosian\u2019s thought\nexperiment, one would think that person-names would track with the\ndifferent stages in the career of the one object, so that, say,\n\u201cAlice\u201d would refer to the thing only in its latest\nstages, and \u201cBob\u201d would apply to it only in its pre-mummy\ncareer. Thus, names like \u201cFather\u201d and \u201cSon\u201d\nshould refer to God only in one or the other of God\u2019s\nPerson-episodes. Mooney suggests, then, that \u201cThe Son became\nincarnate but the Father didn\u2019t\u201d will be true if and only\nif the Son but not the Father is the same person as someone who became\nincarnate, that is, God becomes incarnate in the Person-episode\nassociated with the name \u201cSon\u201d but not in the one\nassociated with \u201cFather\u201d (8).\n\nThis, Mooney argues, shows why when counting objects, we should count\nby (absolute) identity, while when counting persons we should count by\nthe relation same-person. In the Trinity, then, we count one thing but\nthree Persons; the Persons are the same thing but different persons\n(9). The account also solves his \u201cproblem of Triunity\u201d\n(2018), which is that as normally analyzed, these three statements\ncan\u2019t all be true, and yet arguably a trinitarian is committed\nto all three of them:\n\nGod is triune.\nThe Son is God.\nThe Son is not triune. (2020, 10)\n\n\nThe solution is that even though \u201cstrictly speaking, the Son is\ntriune\u201d since the Son just is God and God is triune, the meaning\nof 3 is that \u201cthe Son is not the same person as anyone\nwho is triune\u201d, which is both true and consistent with 1 and 2\n(10). Mooney adds that the property being triune should not be\nconfused with the property of being the same Person as someone who is\ntriune; only the first, in his view, is an essential divine attribute\n(10\u20131).\n\nMooney argues that this account also solves problems relating to\ndivine processions and aseity. The Son, being God, must have the\nproperty of aseity. But Mooney suggests that the Father\u2019s\ngeneration of the Son doesn\u2019t explain the Son\u2019s existence\n(which would rule out the Son's aseity), but only the Son\u2019s\nbeing a person distinct from the Father (12).\n\nThe viability of this theory rests on a particular metaphysics of\npersonhood. One might think, contra Markosian and Mooney, that the\nwoman in the\u00a0story is one being, the mummy is a second being\n(even though composed of many or all of the same parts), and the man\nwho follows is a third being. Similarly, one may wonder whether\nnumerically distinct Persons can each be numerically the same as one\ngod. The theory implies the falsity of the principle that for any x\nand y, if they are different Fs, then x is an F, y is an F, and\nx\u2260y. One might also question the theory\u2019s way of dealing with\napparent differences between the (numerically identical) Persons; any\ndifferences of the form the \u201cthe Father is F but the Son is not\nF\u201d get analyzed as meaning \u201cthe Father is the same Person\nas someone who is F and the Son is not the same Person as someone who\nis F\u201d. Does the original claim really mean what the analysis\nsays?\n",
