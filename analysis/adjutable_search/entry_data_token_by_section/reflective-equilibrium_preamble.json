Perhaps you have many such judgments\nabout different cases. You might, nevertheless, consider that\njudgments alone do not justify the moral views they express.\nYou and your moral interlocutors might be concerned that \u201cwhat\nwe actually accept is fraught with idiosyncrasy and vulnerable to\nvagaries of history and personality\u201d (Elgin 1996: 108) or\ndisplays \u201cirregularities and distortions\u201d (Rawls 1971:\n48).\n\nJohn Rawls proposed to address these concerns through the method\nof reflective equilibrium. We first ensure that our judgments are\nconsidered, being made in circumstances appropriate for moral\ndeliberation. We are then to consider general principles that might\naccommodate our set of considered judgments\u2014and more than that,\nexplain and extend them. On the standard wide reflective\nequilibrium, we are to consider\n\n\nall possible descriptions to which one might plausibly conform\none\u2019s judgments together with all relevant philosophical\narguments for them. (Rawls 1971: 49)\n\n\nThis requires that we reflect on a wide range of principles,\narguments, and theories. Equilibrium is reached where principles and\njudgments have been revised such that they agree with each other. In\nshort, the method of reflective equilibrium is the mutual adjustment\nof principles and judgments in the light of relevant argument and\ntheory.\n\nReflective equilibrium is the dominant method in moral and political\nphilosophy (McPherson 2015: 652; Anderson 2015; de Maagt 2017: 444).\nIts advocates suggest that \u201cit is the only rational game in town\nfor the moral theorist\u201d or \u201cthe only defensible\nmethod\u201d (DePaul 1993: 6; Scanlon 2003: 149; see also Freeman\n2007: 35\u201336; Floyd 2017: 377\u2013378). Though often endorsed,\nit is far more frequently used. Wherever a philosopher presents\nprinciples, motivated by arguments and examples, they are likely to be\nusing the method. They are adjusting their principles\u2014and with\nluck, their readers\u2019\u2014to the judgments suggested by the\narguments and examples. Alternatively they might \u201cbite the\nbullet\u201d by adjusting initially discordant judgments to\naccommodate otherwise appealing principles. Either way, they are\nusually describing a process of reflective equilibrium, with\nprinciples adjusted to judgments or vice versa. Reflective equilibrium\nis a formal expression of standard methodological practice in moral\nand political philosophy. (See Rawls 1971, e.g., 19\u201321, for a\nfamous application of reflective equilibrium, and Rechnitzer 2022 for\na reconstruction of Thomson 2008 in terms of reflective\nequilibrium.)\n\nThis entry first addresses the judgments that are the starting point\nfor reflective equilibrium, examining various interpretations of them\nfound in the literature. It then explores the principles and theories\nthat take us from merely having judgments to reaching reflective\nequilibrium. Finally, it considers some of the main objections to the\nmethod. Throughout the focus will be on reflective equilibrium in its\narchetypal setting of moral and political philosophy, especially as it\nhas been developed by Rawls and Norman Daniels, though with some\nreference to versions of the method developed in other branches of\nphilosophy (e.g., Goodman 1965; Lewis 1983; Elgin 1996).\n",
