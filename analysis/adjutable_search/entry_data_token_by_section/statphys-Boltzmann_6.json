    "main_text": "The H-theorem and the reversibility objection || 1872: The Boltzmann equation and H-theorem\n3.1 1872: The Boltzmann equation and H-theorem\n\n\nIn 1872 Boltzmann published one of his most important papers, its long\ntitle often abbreviated as Weitere Studien (Further\nstudies). It was aimed at something completely new, namely at\nshowing that whatever the initial state of a gas system was, it would\nalways tend to evolve to equilibrium.  Thus, this paper is the first\nwork to deal with non-equilibrium theory.  The paper contained two\ncelebrated results nowadays known as the Boltzmann equation and the\nH-theorem. The latter result was the basis of Boltzmann's\nrenewed claim to have obtained a general theorem corresponding to the\nsecond law. This paper has been studied and commented upon by numerous\nauthors. Indeed an integral translation of the text has been provided\nby (Brush 1966).  Thus, for present purposes, a succinct summary\nof the main points might have been sufficient. However, there is still\ndispute among modern commentators about its actual content.\n\n\nThe issue at stake is the question whether the results obtained in\nthis paper are presented as necessary consequences of the mechanical\nequations of motion, or whether Boltzmann explicitly acknowledged that\nthey would allow for exceptions. Klein has written\n I can find no indication in his 1872 memoir that\nBoltzmann conceived of possible exceptions to the H-theorem,\nas he later called it.  (Klein 1973, 73)\n\n Klein argues that Boltzmann only came to acknowledge the existence of\nsuch exceptions thanks to Loschmidt's critique in 1877. An opposite\nopinion is expressed by von Plato (1994).  He argues that, already in\n1872, Boltzmann was well aware that his H-theorem had\nexceptions, and thus \u201calready had a full hand against his future\ncritics\u201d. Indeed, von Plato states that\n\u2026 contrary to a widely held opinion, Boltzmann is\nnot in 1872 claiming that the Second Law and the Maxwellian\ndistribution are necessary consequences of kinetic theory. (von Plato\n1994, 81) \n\n It might be of some interest to try and settle this dispute. \n\n The Weitere Studien starts with an\nappraisal of the role of probability theory in the context of gas\ntheory. The number of particles in a gas is so enormous, and their\nmovements are so swift that we can observe nothing but average values.\nThe determination of averages is the province of probability calculus.\nTherefore, \u201cthe problems of the mechanical theory of heat are really\nproblems in probability calculus\u201d (WA I, 317). But, Boltzmann says, it\nwould be a mistake to believe that the theory of heat would therefore\ncontain uncertainties.\n\n\nHe emphasizes that one should not confuse incompletely proven\nassertions with rigorously derived theorems of probability theory. The\nlatter are necessary consequences from their premisses, as in any other\ntheory. They will be confirmed by experience as soon as one has\nobserved a sufficiently large number of cases. This last condition,\nhowever, should be no significant problem in the theory of heat because\nof the enormous number of molecules in macroscopic bodies. Yet, in this\ncontext, one has to make doubly sure that we proceed with the utmost\nrigor.\n\n\nThus, the message expressed in the opening pages of this paper seems\nclear enough: the results Boltzmann is about to derive are advertised\nas doubly checked and utterly rigorous. Of course, their relationship\nwith experience might be less secure, since any probability statement\nis only reproduced in observations by sufficiently large numbers of\nindependent data. Thus, Boltzmann would have allowed for exceptions in\nthe relationship between theory and observation, but not in the\nrelation between premisses and conclusion.\n\n\nHe continues by saying what he means by probability, and repeats its\nequivocation as a fraction of time and the relative number of particles\nthat we have seen earlier in 1868a:\nIf one wants [\u2026] to build up an exact theory\n[\u2026] it is before all necessary to determine the probabilities\nof the various states that one and the same molecule assumes in the\ncourse of a very long time, and that occur simultaneously for\ndifferent molecules. That is, one must calculate how the number of\nthose molecules whose states lie between certain limits relates to the\ntotal number of molecules (WA I, 317).\n\n This equivocation is not vicious however. For most of the paper the\nintended meaning of probability is always the relative number of\nmolecules with a particular molecular state. Only at the final stages\nof his paper (WA I, 400) does the time-average interpretation of\nprobability (suddenly) recur.\n\n\nBoltzmann says that both he and Maxwell had attempted the\ndetermination of these probabilities for a gas system but without\nreaching a complete solution. Yet, on a closer inspection, \u201cit seems\nnot so unlikely that these probabilities can be derived on the basis\nof the equations of motion alone\u2026\u201d (WA I, 317). Indeed, he\nannounces, he has solved this problem for gases whose molecules\nconsist of an arbitrary number of atoms. His aim is to prove that\nwhatever the initial state in such a system of gas molecules, it must\ninevitably approach the state characterized by the Maxwell\ndistribution (WA I, 320).\n\n\nThe next section specializes to the simplest case of monatomic gases\nand also provides a more complete specification of the problem he aims\nto solve. The gas molecules are modelled as hard spheres, contained in\na fixed vessel with perfectly elastic walls (WA I, 320). Boltzmann\nrepresents the state of the gas by a time-dependent distribution\nfunction \\(f_t(\\vec{v})\\) which gives us, at each time \\(t\\), the\nrelative number of molecules with velocity\n\\(\\vec{v}\\).[11]\nHe also states three more special assumptions:\n\nAlready in the initial state of the gas, each direction of velocity\nis equally probable, i.e.,\n\n\\[\\notag\nf_0(\\vec{v}) = f_0(v).\n\\]\n \nThe gas is spatially uniform. That is, the relative number of\nmolecules with their velocities in any given interval does not depend\non the location within the vessel.\nThe Sto\u00dfzahlansatz (2).\n\n\n After a few well-known manipulations, the result from these\nassumptions is a differentio-integral equation (the Boltzmann\nequation) that determines the evolution of the distribution function\n\\(f_t(v)\\) from any given initial form. \n\n\nThere are also a few unstated assumptions that go into the derivation\nof this equation. First, the number of molecules must be large enough\nso that the (discrete) distribution of their velocities can be well\napproximated by a continuous and differentiable function\n\\(f\\). Secondly, \\(f\\) changes under the effect of binary collisions\nonly. This means that the density of the gas should be low (so that\nthree-particle collisions can be ignored) but not too low (so that\ncollisions would be too infrequent to change \\(f\\) at all. (The modern\nprocedure to put these requirements in a mathematically precise form\nis that of taking the so-called Boltzmann-Grad limit.) A final\ningredient is that all the above assumptions are not only valid at an\ninstant but remain true in the course of time.\n\nThe H-theorem. Assuming that the Boltzmann\nequation is valid for all times, one can prove without difficulty the\n\u201cH-theorem\u201d: the quantity \\(H\\) (that Boltzmann\nin this paper actually denotes as \\(E\\)), defined as \n\n\\[\nH[f_t] := \\int f_t(v) \\ln f_t(v) d^3\\vec{v}\n\\]\n\n\n\ndecreases monotonically in time, i.e.,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dH[f_t]}{dt} \\le 0\n\\]\n\n\n\nas well as its stationarity for the Maxwell distribution, i.e., \n\n\\[\\notag\ndH[f_t]/dt = 0, \\text{if } f_t(v) = Ae^{-Bv^2}\n\\]\n\n\n\nBoltzmann concludes this section of the paper as follows:\n\nIt has thus been rigorously proved that whatever may have been the\ninitial distribution of kinetic energy, in the course of time it must\nnecessarily approach the form found by Maxwell. [\u2026] This\n[proof] actually gains much in significance because of its\napplicability on the theory of multi-atomic gas molecules. There too,\none can prove for a certain quantity \\(E\\) that, because of the\nmolecular motion, this quantity can only decrease or in the limiting\ncase remain constant. Thus, one may prove that, because of the atomic\nmovement in systems consisting of arbitrarily many material points,\nthere always exists a quantity which, due to these atomic movements,\ncannot increase, and this quantity agrees, up to a constant factor,\nexactly with the value that I found in [Boltzmann 1871c] for the\nwell-known integral \\(\\int dQ/T\\).\nThis provides an analytical proof of the Second Law in a way\ncompletely different from those attempted so far. Up till now, one has\nattempted to proof that \\(\\int dQ/T = 0\\) for reversible\n(umkehrbaren) cyclic[12] processes, which however does not prove\nthat for an irreversible cyclic process, which is the only one\nnote-that occurs in nature, it is always negative; the reversible\nprocess being merely an idealization, which can be approached more or\nless but never perfectly. Here, however, we immediately reach the\nresult that \\(\\int dQ/T\\) is in general negative and zero only in a\nlimit case\u2026 (WA I, 345)\n\n\n\nThus, as in his 1866 paper, Boltzmann claims to have a rigorous,\nanalytical and general proof of the Second Law.\n",
