    "main_text": "The Science of Human Action and Social Reform || Historical Inquiry and Moral Knowledge\n3.3 Historical Inquiry and Moral Knowledge\n\nIn \u201cThe Propaganda of History,\u201d the final chapter of\nBlack Reconstruction (1935), Du Bois maintains that\n\u201cscientific\u201d historiography\u2014that is, historiography\nthat \u201cset[s] down\u201d the record of \u201chuman\naction\u201d with \u201caccuracy and faithfulness of\ndetail\u201d\u2014can serve the ends of social reform; it can be\nused, he writes, \u201cas a measuring rod and guidepost for the\nfuture of nations\u201d (Du Bois, 1935, 584). Du Bois\u2019s\nargument for this claim proceeds through a defense of four theses: 1)\nthat the study of history, so far as it belongs to the science of\nhuman action, cannot model itself exclusively on the natural sciences;\n2) that accuracy in chronicling and explaining human action requires\nthat the historian rely on the method of interpretive\nunderstanding\u2014what Max Weber called Verstehen; 3) that,\ncontra Weber, accurate, empirically sound historiography reports moral\nknowledge; and 4) that the knowledge of morality and moral\nresponsibility yielded by the scientific study of human history (by\naccurate historiography) can contribute to social reform, for the\nphilosopher and the prophet can use that knowledge to guide mankind in\nthe solution of social problems (1935, 591).\n\nDu Bois criticizes histories that discuss slavery with moral\n\u201cimpartially,\u201d depicting America as helpless and the south\nas blameless, while explaining the difference in development, North\nand South, as \u201ca sort of working out of cosmic social and\neconomic law\u201d (1935, 585). An example of this sort of history is\nCharles and Mary Beard\u2019s The Rise of American\nCivilization, which treats the clash between north and south as\nif it were a clash between winds and waters. In the Beard\u2019s\n\u201csweeping mechanistic interpretation\u201d of history, Du Bois\nwrites, \u201cthere is no room for the real plot of the story, for\nthe clear mistake and guilt of rebuilding a new slavery of the working\nclass in the midst of a fateful experiment in democracy; for the\ntriumph of sheer moral courage and sacrifice in the abolition crusade;\nand for the hurt and struggle of degraded black millions in their\nfight for freedom and their attempt to enter democracy. Can all this\nbe omitted and half suppressed in a treatise that calls itself\nscientific?\u201d (1935, 585).\n\nAt issue here, again, as in \u201cThe Conservation of Races\u201d\nand \u201cSociology Hesitant,\u201d is the relation between the\nhuman sciences and the natural sciences. For the Du Bois of\nBlack Reconstruction, historians who model their inquiry\nexclusively on the natural sciences (historians like the Beards) seek\nto identify the causal uniformities (\u201ccosmic\u201d laws)\ngoverning human events, which events they conceptualize by analogy to\nthe behavior of the winds, waters and other forces of nature. The\nproblem here, Du Bois believes, is not with the effort to identify the\ncausal uniformities governing human events. Rather it is with the\ntendency in that effort to neglect the human meaning of human events,\nand thus to treat those events as inhuman, natural forces that lend\nthemselves to a purely \u201cmechanistic\u201d explanation\u2014by\nwhich Du Bois means explanation in terms that make no reference to the\nmeanings that the human subjects who participate in those events\nattach to them.\n\nIf history is to be a science of human action and not to pretend to be\na science of nature, then, Du Bois believes, it must take account of\nthe subjective meanings of actions and events. Du Bois implies that\nthe historian cannot truly tell the story of \u201cthe mightiest\neffort of the mightiest century\u201d (the struggle of enslaved\nblacks to achieve democracy) without taking account of the\n\u201cpsychology\u201d of the agents whose actions sustained that\neffort\u2014for to take psychology into account is to take subjective\nmeaning into account (1935, 586). More generally, Du Bois insists that\nthe historian of slavery ask: \u201cJust what did [slavery] mean to\nthe owner and the owned\u201d(1935, 585).\n\nTo understand slavery, knowing what it meant to the owned is no less\nimportant than knowing what it meant to the owners. In demanding that\nthe historian of slavery attend to the slaves\u2019 stories about\nslavery in order to know what slavery meant to the slaves, Du Bois\npresupposes the fundamental, methodological tenet that the\nhistorian\u2019s primary charge is what Max Weber called\nVerstehen, or \u201cinterpretive understanding,\u201d\nnot mechanical explanation. According to Weber, the sciences\nof human action, including history and sociology, \u201cspeak of\n\u2018action\u2019 insofar as the acting individual attaches\nsubjective meaning to his behavior\u2014be it overt or covert\u201d\n(1922, 38, 41). One of the aims of Verstehen, he argues, is\nrationally to make sense of the motivation prompting an action by\nplacing that action \u201cin an intelligible and more inclusive\ncontext of meaning\u201d\u2014as when, for example, we interpret a\nwoodchopper\u2019s chopping of wood as an act undertaken to secure a\nwage; or, alternatively, to provide a supply of firewood for the\nwoodchopper\u2019s use (1922, 42).\n\nDu Bois stresses the importance of interpretive understanding because\nhe is committed to the view that moral judgment is a critical\ncomponent of historiography. Thus, while Du Bois methodologically\naligns himself with Weber in stressing the importance of interpretive\nunderstanding to the scientific study of history, he methodologically\nrejects Weber\u2019s claim that \u201cconcern on the part of history\nto judge of historical actions as responsible before the conscience of\nhistory\u2026would suspend its character as empirical science\u201d\n(Weber, 1905b,\n 123).[34]\n\nUnlike Weber, Du Bois is a moral realist who believes that historical\ninquiry can afford us knowledge of moral facts\u2014knowledge, that\nis, of the proper distribution of moral responsibility and of the\nextent to which actions are right or wrong. But to obtain that\nknowledge, historians must understand human action in terms of\nsubjective meanings, for they require some such understanding of human\naction to render intelligible their application of the vocabulary of\nmoral evaluation\u2014for Du Bois, a vocabulary that includes the\nlanguage of \u201cguilt,\u201d of \u201cmoral courage and\nsacrifice,\u201d and of \u201cthe degraded black millions.\u201d Du\nBois argues that a necessary condition of the possibility of acquiring\nknowledge of moral facts through the historian\u2019s practice of the\nscience of human action is a Verstehen-centered approach to\nthat practice\u2014or, more exactly, an approach that explains human\nactions in terms of subjects\u2019 motives. Du Bois sketches a\nsimilar line of argument, five years later, in Dusk of Dawn\n(1940, 70).\n\nFor Du Bois, the function of the historian, \u201cposing\u201d as a\nscientist of human action, is \u201cto make clear the facts\u2026to\nknow, as far as possible\u2026the things that actually happened in\nthe world\u201d without regard to her personal desires and wishes\n(1935, 591). But the function of the philosopher and the prophet, he\nargues, is \u201cto interpret these facts\u201d \u2014that is, to\nconsider them in the perspective of our desire to guide mankind to\nundertake the social reforms needed to address social problems (1935,\n591).\n\nA prophet, a Jeremiah, for example, might well adduce facts of moral\nwrongdoing and guilt to alert his fellow citizens that their actions\nrisk God\u2019s wrath. And a philosopher, a philosopher of history,\nfor example, might adduce those facts in order to instruct them as to\nthe meaning, writ large, of the plot that the historian has\nchronicled\u2014precisely as Du Bois instructs his fellow citizens\nthat the story of slavery and reconstruction he has chronicled (in his\ncapacity as an historian) exhibits \u201cthe clear mistake and\nguilt\u201d that characterizes the \u201cplot\u201d of Aristotelian\ntragedy (1935, 585, 595). In both cases, the point would be the same:\nnamely, to use moral knowledge to warn one\u2019s fellow citizens of\nthe fateful consequences (God\u2019s wrath, tragedy) that await them\nlest they refuse to heed the lessons of the past and\nchange\u2014reform\u2014their ways.\n",
