Introduction: How Should We Define Health and Disease?\n\nOne of the fundamental and most long-standing debates in the\nphilosophy of medicine relates to the basic concepts of health and\ndisease (see\n concepts of health and disease).\n It may seem obvious what we mean by such statements: people seek\ntreatment from medical professionals when they are feeling unwell, and\nclinicians treat patients in order to help them restore or maintain\ntheir health. But people seek advice and assistance from medical\nprofessionals for other reasons, such as pregnancy which cannot be\nconstrued as a disease state, and high blood pressure which is\nasymptomatic. Thus the dividing line between disease and health is\nnotoriously vague, due in part to the wide range of variations present\nin the human population and to debates over whether many concepts of\ndisease are socially constructed. One of the further complicating\nfactors is that both the concepts of health and disease typically\ninvolve both descriptive and evaluatory aspects (Engelhardt 1975),\nboth in common usage among lay persons and members of the medical\nprofession.\n\nExploring these distinctions remains epistemologically and morally\nimportant as these definitions influence when and where people seek\nmedical treatment, and whether society regards them as\n\u201cill\u201d, including in some health systems whether they are\npermitted to receive treatment. As Tristram Engelhardt has argued,\n\n\n\nthe concept of disease acts not only to describe and explain, but also\nto enjoin to action. It indicates a state of affairs as undesirable\nand to be overcome. (1975: 127) \n\n\nHence how we define disease, health, and related concepts is not a\nmatter of mere philosophical or theoretical interest, but critical for\nethical reasons, particularly to make certain that medicine\ncontributes to people\u2019s well-being, and for social reasons, as\none\u2019s well-being is critically related to whether one can live a\ngood life.\n\nThe terms \u201cdisease\u201d and \u201cillness\u201d often are\nused interchangeably, particularly by the general public but also by\nmedical professionals. \u201cDisease\u201d is generally held to\nrefer to any condition that literally causes \u201cdis-ease\u201d or\n\u201clack of ease\u201d in an area of the body or the body as a\nwhole. Such a condition can be caused by internal dysfunctions such as\nautoimmune diseases, by external factors such as infectious or\nenvironmentally-induced diseases, or by a combination of these factors\nas is the case with many so-called \u201cgenetic\u201d diseases (on\nthe idea of genetic disease and associated problems, see for instance\nHesslow 1984, Ankeny 2002, Juengst 2004). It has been argued that\nthere is no philosophically or scientifically compelling distinction\nbetween diseases and other types of complaints that many would not\nconsider to be diseases such as small stature, obesity, or migraine\nheadaches (Reznek 1987). The notion of \u201cdisease\u201d is common\namong most cultures, and may even be a universal concept (Fabrega\n1979). It is a useful concept as it allows a clear focus on problems\nthat afflict particular human beings and suggests that medicine can\nhelp to control or ameliorate such problems. In contrast,\n\u201cillness\u201d is usually used to describe the more\nnon-objective features of a condition, such as subjective feelings of\npain and discomfort. It often refers to behavioral changes which are\njudged as undesirable and unwanted within a particular culture, and\nhence lead members of that culture to seek help, often from\nprofessionals identified as health providers of some type within that\nculture (on some of the complexities relating to the triad of concepts\n\u201cdisease, illness, sickness\u201d, see Hofmann 2002).\n\nThe term \u201csickness\u201d emphasizes the more social aspects of\nill health, and typically highlights the lack of value placed on a\nparticular condition by society. Disease conditions are investigated\nnot only to be understood scientifically, but in hopes of correcting,\npreventing, or caring for the states that are disvalued, or that make\npeople sick. The classic work of the sociologist Talcott Parsons\n(1951) showed how the \u201csick role\u201d relieves one of certain\nsocial responsibilities (for example, allows one to take time off work\nor to avoid family responsibilities) and also relieves blame for being\nill (though not necessarily from having become ill in the first\nplace). Although there are exceptions and counterexamples to this\nmodel (for example, some chronic diseases), it does fit our generally\naccepted societal notions of what it means to be sick (and healthy),\nand the moral duties and responsibilities that accompany the\ndesignation of someone as sick.\n\nThe dominant approach in much of the recent philosophical scholarship\non the philosophy of medicine views disease concepts as involving\nempirical judgments about human physiology (Boorse 1975, 1977, 1997;\nScadding 1990; Wachbroit 1994; Thagard 1999; Ereshefsky 2009). These\nso-called \u201cnaturalists\u201d (sometimes called\n\u201cobjectivists\u201d, for example see Kitcher 1997, or\n\u201cdescriptivists\u201d) focus on what is biologically natural\nand normal functioning for all human beings (or more precisely human\nbeings who are members of relevant classes such as those within a\nparticular age group or of the same sex). They argue that medicine\nshould aim to discover and describe the underlying biological criteria\nwhich allow us to define various diseases. Christopher Boorse\u2019s\nrevised account has been the most influential in the literature,\nclaiming that health is the absence of disease, where a disease is an\ninternal state which either impairs normal functional ability or else\na limitation on functional ability caused by the environment (Boorse\n1997). \u201cNormal functioning\u201d is defined in terms of a\nreference class which is a natural class of organisms of uniform\nfunctional design (i.e., within a specific age group and sex), so that\nwhen a process or a part (such as an organ) functions in a normal way,\nit makes a contribution that is statistically typical to the survival\nand reproduction of the individual whose body contains that process or\npart. His definition includes specific reference to the environment so\nas not to rule out environmentally-induced conditions which are so\ncommon as to be statistically normal such as dental caries.\n\nMany have criticized these approaches (to name just a few, Goosens\n1980; Reznek 1987; Wakefield 1992; Amundson 2000; Cooper 2002), as\nwell as naturalistic accounts of disease more generally. As they have\nnoted, naturalistic accounts do not reflect our typical usage of the\nterms \u201cdisease\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d because they\nneglect to take into account any values which shape judgments about\nwhether or not someone is healthy. The usual counterexamples proposed\nto naturalism are masturbation, which was widely believed to be a\nserious disease entity in the 18th and 19th\ncenturies (Engelhardt 1974), and homosexuality, which for most of the\n20th century was classified as a disease in the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association.\nThese are counterexamples as their redefinitions as non-disease\nconditions were due not to new biological information about these\nstates of being but changes in society\u2019s moral values.\nNaturalists respond to such arguments by pointing out that\nhomosexuality and masturbation were never diseases in the first place\nbut erroneous classifications, and thus these examples do not affect\nthe validity of the definition of disease favored by them when it is\napplied rigorously.\n\nA more telling criticism of naturalism is that although its advocates\nclaim to rely exclusively on biological science to generate their\ndefinitions of health and disease, these rely implicitly on an\nequation of statistical and theoretical normality (or the\n\u201cnatural state\u201d of the organism), at least in\nBoorse\u2019s formulation (Ereshefsky 2009). But biology does not\ngive us these norms directly, nor is there anything absolutely\nstandard in \u201cspecies design\u201d (as many philosophers of\nbiology have argued) despite Boorse\u2019s claims. No particular\ngenes are the \u201cnatural\u201d ones for a given population, even\nif we take a subgroup according to age or gender (Sober 1980). Nor\ndoes standard physiology provide these norms (Ereshefsky 2009), not in\nthe least part because physiological accounts typically provide\nidealized and simplified descriptions of organs and their functions,\nbut not of their natural states (Wachbroit 1994). Rachel Cooper (2002)\ncompellingly argues that coming up with an acceptable conception of\nnormal function (and in turn dysfunction) is the major problem with\nBoorsian-style accounts, arguing that his analysis should focus on\ndisposition to malfunction instead. This argument utilizes\ncounterexamples such as activities that interfere with normal\nfunctioning such as taking contraceptive pills that are not diseases,\nas well as examples of persons with chronic diseases controlled by\ndrugs who function normally as a result. Elselijn Kingma (2007, 2010)\nhas critiqued Boorse\u2019s appeal to reference classes as\nobjectively discoverable, arguing that these cannot be established\nwithout reference to normative judgments. A further issue often noted\nwith regard to naturalistic accounts of disease (for example, that of\nLennox 1995) is the underlying assumption that biological fitness\n(survival and reproduction) is the goal of human life, and along with\nthis that medicine is only considered to be interested in biological\nfitness, rather than other human goals and values, some of which might\nindeed run contrary to or make no difference in terms of the goal of\nbiological fitness, such as relief of pain.\n\nAn alternative approach in the philosophical literature to\nnaturalist/descriptivist/objectivist definitions of disease and health\ncan roughly be termed \u201cnormative\u201d or\n\u201cconstructivist\u201d. Most proponents agree that we must\ndefine the terms \u201cdisease\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d\nexplicitly and that our definitions are a function of our values\n(Margolis 1976; Goosens 1980; Sedgewick 1982; Engelhardt 1986). Hence\ndefining various disease conditions is not merely a matter of\ndiscovering patterns in nature, but requires a series of normative\nvalue judgments and invention of appropriate terms to describe such\nconditions. Conversely, health involves shared judgments about what we\nvalue and what we want to be able to do; disease is a divergence from\nthese social norms. Normativists believe that their definitions are\nvalid not only philosophically but also reflect actual usage of the\nterminology associated with disease and health both in common language\nand among medical professionals. They also claim that this approach\nmore adequately explains how certain conditions can come to be viewed\nin different ways over the course of history as our values changed\ndespite relatively few changes in our underlying biological theories\nabout the condition, for example homosexuality. Further, they are able\nto accommodate examples of so-called folk illnesses or culture-bound\nsyndromes such as ghost sickness among some Native American tribes,\nthe evil eye in many Mediterranean cultures, or susto in\nLatin and South American cultures, as their theories explicitly allow\nfor cross-cultural differences in understandings of disease and\nhealth.\n\nHowever normativism also generates a series of typical criticisms: it\ncannot cope adequately with cases where there is general agreement\nthat a state is undesirable (such as alcoholism or morbid obesity) but\nno similar general agreement that the state is actually a disease\ncondition (Ershefsky 2009). Another classic objection is that\nnormative accounts do not allow us to make retrospective judgments\nabout the validity of disease categories such as\n\u201cdrapetomania\u201d (a disease which was commonly diagnosed\namong American slaves in the 19th century, with the main\nsymptom being the tendency to run away) (Cartwright 1851). The\nnormativist can point to changes in values to explain the abandonment\nof belief in this disease condition, but would not be able to claim\nthat the doctors were in any sense \u201cwrong\u201d to consider\ndrapetomania to be a disease. Hence there is more involved in our\neveryday usage of the terms \u201cdisease\u201d and\n\u201chealth\u201d than just value or normative conditions.\n\nHybrid theories of health and disease attempt to overcome the gaps in\nboth the naturalistic and normative approaches, by hybridizing aspects\nof both theories (Reznek 1987; Wakefield 1992; Caplan 1992). For\ninstance Jerome Wakefield (1992, 1996, 2007), writing about\npsychiatric conditions in particular, notes that a condition should be\nconsidered a disease if it both causes harm to the person or otherwise\ncontributes diminished value, and the condition results from some\ninternal mechanism failing to perform its natural function (hence for\ninstance much of what is diagnosed as \u201cdepression\u201d would\nfail to count as a disease condition). Whereas the normativist is\ncommitted to calling any undesirable state a disease condition, these\nhybrid criteria rule out calling conditions \u201cdiseases\u201d\nwhich are non-biological,. Then various marginal cases might be\nconsidered to be healthy rather than potentially described as\ndiseased, and hence might not be eligible for treatment within\nconventional medicine. Examples include those organs or structures\nthat no longer have a function due to evolutionary processes cannot\nmalfunction and so cannot be diseased. Many hybrid approaches also\nretain too many assumptions about their naturalistic components, and\nhence are criticized for relying on a notion of natural function which\ncannot be supported by biology.\n\nThe concept of health has been relatively undertheorized in comparison\nto those of disease and illness, perhaps in part because it raises\neven more complicated issues than these concepts describing its\nabsence. One could be a straightforward naturalist about health, and\ndefine it as being a product of a functional biology; however this\nargument would run afoul of the same criticisms of naturalism\nrecounted above (see Hare 1986). The source for the classic definition\nof health comes from the Constitution of the World Health Organization\n(WHO) which defines health \n\n\na state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not\nmerely the absence of disease or infirmity. (WHO 1948: preamble) \n\n\nNotice that according to this formulation, health is not just the\nabsence of disease but a positive state of well-being and flourishing\n(notoriously ambiguous concepts in themselves). Although quality of\nlife is often cited as critical to definitions and theories of health,\nmany commentators are wary of the expansiveness of a definition\nsimilar to the WHO\u2019s terminology, as it seems to encompass many\nthings beyond the health of the individual which could contribute (or\ndiminish) his or her \u201cwell-being\u201d.\n\nA more narrow definition of health takes its rightful domain as being\nthe state which medicine aims to restore, and its opposite to be\n\u201cunhealth\u201d or falling short of being healthy, rather than\ndisease as such (Kass 1975). Under such a definition, medicine should\nnot engage in aesthetic surgery or elective terminations of pregnancy\nor similar procedures which do not (strictly speaking) seek to restore\nhealth. Caroline Whitbeck (1981) has defined health in terms of the\npsychological and physiological capacities of an individual that allow\nhim or her to pursue a wide range of goals and projects. Hence her\naccount is a type of hybrid approach, since she places biological\ncapacities at the core of her definition of health but only in so far\nas they help individuals to flourish and live their lives as they wish\nto do. The concept of health here is much more than the absence of\ndisease; for instance, one could have a high level of health while\nstill suffering from a particular disease condition.\n\nOne much discussed philosophical approach to defining health is that\nof Georges Canguilhem (1991, based on work in the early 1940s), who\nargued against equating it with normality. He noted that the concept\nof a norm could not be defined objectively in a manner that could be\ndetermined using scientific methods. Physiology deals with the science\nof norms, but even scientifically-based medical approaches should not\nfocus solely on norms, contrary to for instance the ideal vision of\nmedicine according to Claude Bernard (1865). The history of how the\ndistinction between the normal and pathological became so entrenched\nis explored in detail in Michel Foucault\u2019s now classic work\n(1963). Both Foucault and Canguilhem sought to reveal how values have\nbeen built into the epistemological framework underlying modern\nmedicine.\n\nOne of the key points in Canguilhem\u2019s argument is that our usage\nof the term \u201cnormal\u201d often conflates two distinct\nmeanings: the usual or typical, and that which is as it ought to be.\nConsequently, he argues that there can be no purely scientific or\nobjective definition of the normal that allows us to take the theories\nof physiology and apply them in medical practice, and accordingly we\ncannot define health as normality either. Instead, according to him,\nhealth is that which confers a survival value, particularly\nadaptability within a set of environmental conditions: \u201cto be in\ngood health is being able to fall sick and recover; it is a biological\nluxury\u201d (1991: 199).\nDisease, then, is reduction in the levels of tolerance for the\nvagaries of the environment. As Mary Tiles (1993) has noted, this\nemphasis on health rather than normality is a particularly useful tool\nfor enriching contemporary debates over preventative medicine and more\ngenerally the trend toward the development of a positive conception of\nhealth. Havi Carel (2007, 2008) has contributed to this strand of\nthought, developing a phenomenological notion of health which\nemphasizes that health should be understood as the lived experience of\none's own body rather than as simply statistically normal bodily\nfunctioning in abstract biological terms. Hence she develops an\nexpressly revisionist project, emphasizing that a phenomenological\nperspective accommodates cases where someone is ill (in biological\nterms) but healthy, such as in chronic illness.\n\nA number of authors have made even more extreme claims, arguing that\nseeking concepts of disease is bound to be a failed effort. For\ninstance, Peter Schwartz (2007) claims that there is not an underlying\ngeneral concept of disease within the biomedical sciences that is\ncoherent enough to be analyzed, and that different concepts of disease\nmight be useful within different contexts. Some philosophers have\nargued that to seek correct definitions for \u201cdisease\u201d and\n\u201chealth\u201d is distracting and irrelevant when it comes to\nclinical decisions: as Germund Hesslow puts it, \u201cthe\nhealth/disease distinction is irrelevant for most decisions and\nrepresents a conceptual straightjacket [sic]\u201d (1993: 1). The key is whether or not a\nparticular state is desirable to its bearer, and not whether the\nperson actually has a disease or defect. For instance, the term\n\u201cmalady\u201d has been proposed as a more appropriate\nalternative to \u201cdisease\u201d (Clouser, Culver, and Gert 1981),\nand which should be extended to include all illnesses, injuries,\nhandicaps, dysfunctions, and even asymptomatic conditions. A malady is\npresent when there is something wrong with a person; regardless of the\ncause (mental or physical), to be a malady, the condition must be part\nof its bearer and not distinct or external to him or her. The clear\nadvantage of this approach is that it unifies a range of phenomena and\ndescriptions that seem intuitively to be related. The disadvantages\ninclude that it relies in part on an objectivist approach to disease,\nand hence suffers from some of the difficulties detailed above that\nplague some versions of naturalism (for a provocative reaction to this\ndebate, see Worrall and Worrall 2001).\n\nAn alternative approach to defining disease and health has been\ndescribed by Marc Ereshefsky (2009) in terms of making distinct state\ndescriptions (descriptions of physiological or psychological states\nwhile avoiding any claims about naturalness, functionality, or\nnormality), and normative claims (explicit judgments about whether we\nvalue or disvalue a particular physiological or psychological state).\nThis approach has the advantages of allowing more clarity about\ncontroversial \u201cdisease\u201d conditions as it avoids the need\nto apply the term explicitly. It also forces us to pinpoint the key\nissues that matter to understanding and treating someone suffering\nfrom ill health. But perhaps most persuasively, he argues that this\napproach allows us to distinguish the current state of a human from\nthose we wish to promote or diminish, whereas the terms\n\u201cdisease\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d do not adequately\nhighlight this critical distinction.\n\nIn short, philosophers of medicine continue to debate a range of\naccounts: in broad outline, the most vigorous disagreement centers on\nwhether more objective, biologically-based, and generalizable accounts\nare preferable to those that incorporate social and experiential\nperspectives. It is clear that none satisfy all of the desiderata of a\ncomplete and robust philosophical account that also can be useful for\npractitioners; although some would dispute whether the latter should\nbe a requirement, many believe that philosophy of medicine should be\nresponsive to and helpful for actual clinical practices.\n",
