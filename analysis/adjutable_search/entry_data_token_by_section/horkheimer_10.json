    "main_text": "The Critique of Reason and the Domination of Nature || Sources of Emancipation\n5. Late Work\n\nWith his return to Frankfurt the year after the publication of both\nEclipse of Reason and Dialectic of Enlightenment,\nHorkheimer\u2019s academic production would largely consist of essays\nand lectures. He also left a number of unpublished texts from the\nperiod, including a set of notes and aphorisms published shortly after\nhis death (along with a set of aphorisms from the early 30s titled\nD\u00e4mmerung) under the name Notizen 1950 bis\n1969. There is no real systematic unity to these writings\n(Habermas 1993, p. 51 even refers to them as \u201cshot through with\ncontradictions\u201d), but there are common themes that can be\nexplored.\n\nOne can, for instance, trace out Horkheimer\u2019s late views on the\ntasks of critical theory. In a remark in Notizen from\n1957\u20131958 titled \u201cCritical Theory,\u201d he pursues the\nidea mentioned in the preface to Eclipse that philosophy need\nnot be immediately related to practical action. Philosophy\n\u201cholds up a mirror to the world\u201d but \u201cit is no\nimperative\u201d (p. 148). It is as though Horkheimer wants to guard\nagainst a caricature of his earlier views as blindly equating theory\nand practice. But there is also a very pessimistic note sounded when\nHorkheimer says that philosophy \u201chas replaced theology but found\nno new heaven to which it might point, not even a heaven on\nearth\u201d (p. 148). Horkheimer touches on these same themes in his\n1956 conversations with Adorno in which they preliminarily discussed\nproducing a new (never finished) joint work. In the transcripts of\nthose conversations (which were published in 1989 as a part of\nHorkheimer\u2019s collected works with the title\n\u201cDiskussion \u00fcber Theorie und Praxis\u201d) one\nfinds Horkheimer continually stressing the importance of linking\ntheory to practice without reducing the former to the latter. And\nwhile he does at points seem to hold out a vague hope for such a\ncombination of theory and practice, he also pessimistically claims\nthat \u201cit is easy to believe that the whole of world history is\njust a fly caught in the flames\u201d (p.39). Because of this\npessimism, critical theory takes on a primarily negative task. In\nanother note from a collection dated 1966\u20131969 titled \u201cOn\nCritical Theory\u201d he continues with the idea that no positive\nconception of the good can be formed, but \u201cif one wishes to\ndefine the good as the attempt to abolish evil,\u201d such a view can\nbe formed, and \u201cthis is the teaching of Critical Theory\u201d\n(p. 237).\n\nThe negative conception of critical theory is closely related to the\nrenewed interest Horkheimer showed in Schopenhauer in his last works.\nSchopenhauer is said, in the 1961 essay \u201cSchopenhauer\nToday,\u201d to be \u201cthe teacher for modern times\u201d (p.\n81). This is in part because Schopenhauer\u2019s work grasps the need\nto focus on the suffering of the present as it is, without covering it\nover with a false philosophical conception of the good. To a certain\nextent this repeats the earlier emphasis on suffering and rejection of\nmetaphysics. But these points work in a much more pessimistic\ndirection, because, \u201caccording to Schopenhauer, philosophy does\nnot set up any practical aims\u201d (p. 80). It rather focuses on\ncorrectly grasping suffering. Schopenhauerian pessimism also connects\nwith an interest in negative theology in Horkheimer\u2019s late work.\nIn 1935, he would write that the religious belief in another world of\nperfect justice, when uncoupled from \u201cthe inhibiting religious\nform\u201d amounted to a positive force for social change (Horkheimer\n1935c, p. 131). In his late writings this combination of criticism of\norganized religion and respect for the desire for the \u201cwholly\nother\u201d would be further developed (see Siebert 1976). In\nreligious beliefs, if not in organized religion, Horkheimer would find\na desire for a better world that never forgets the suffering of this\nworld (see, for instance, Horkheimer 1963).\n\nThe overall tenor of Horkheimer\u2019s last writings has led some to\ncriticize him for falling into a backhanded form of conservatism (see,\nfor example, Bronner 1994, pp. 88\u201392). This criticism makes some\nsense, especially when one considers the political climate of the late\n1960s that served as a backdrop for his latest work. It is pertinent,\nalong these lines, that he was generally opposed to the radical\nstudent movements, and he supported (with much qualification) the\nVietnam War as an attempt to halt the totalitarian movement of Chinese\nCommunism (on these points see Stirk 1992, 178\u2013181). But\nHorkheimer did not give up on the possibility of radical action\nentirely. For example, Notizen ends on something of a\npositive note by ( in the note \u201cFor Nonconformism\u201d)\nholding out hope that the \u201ccritical analysis of\ndemagogues\u201d might aid the practical work of those who are\nattempting to create non-conformist collectives that work against\ncurrent society. But the primary possibility for hope discussed in\nHorkheimer\u2019s later work is compassion, as seen at the end of the\n1961 essay \u201cThe German Jews\u201d:\n\nThe decisive point\u2014and the real task of education without which\nneither the Jewish nor the Christian nor the German cause is\nhelped\u2014is that men should become sensitive not to injustice\nagainst the Jews but to any and all persecution, and that something in\nthem should rebel when any individual is not treated as a rational\nbeing. (p. 118)\n\n\nIn a way, this passage sums up the aim of all of Horkheimer\u2019s\nwork, early to late. The task of education, and the task of the\ncritical theorist, is to foster such compassionate sensitivity to\ninjustice.\n",
