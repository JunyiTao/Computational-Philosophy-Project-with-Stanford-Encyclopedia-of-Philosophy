Major Themes in Emerson\u2019s Philosophy\n2.1 Education\n\nIn \u201cThe American Scholar,\u201d delivered as the Phi Beta Kappa\nAddress in 1837, Emerson maintains that the scholar is educated by\nnature, books, and action. Nature is the first in time (since it is\nalways there) and the first in importance of the three. Nature\u2019s\nvariety conceals underlying laws that are at the same time laws of the\nhuman mind: \u201cthe ancient precept, \u2018Know thyself,\u2019\nand the modern precept, \u2018Study nature,\u2019 become at last one\nmaxim\u201d (CW1: 55). Books, the second component of the\nscholar\u2019s education, offer us the influence of the past. Yet\nmuch of what passes for education is mere idolization of books \u2014\ntransferring the \u201csacredness which applies to the act of\ncreation\u2026to the record.\u201d The proper relation to books is\nnot that of the \u201cbookworm\u201d or \u201cbibliomaniac,\u201d\nbut that of the \u201ccreative\u201d reader (CW1: 58) who uses books\nas a stimulus to attain \u201chis own sight of principles.\u201d\nUsed well, books \u201cinspire\u2026the active soul\u201d (CW1:\n56). Great books are mere records of such inspiration, and their value\nderives only, Emerson holds, from their role in inspiring or recording\nsuch states of the soul. The \u201cend\u201d Emerson finds in nature\nis not a vast collection of books, but, as he puts it in \u201cThe\nPoet,\u201d \u201cthe production of new individuals,\u2026or the\npassage of the soul into higher forms\u201d (CW3:14).\n\nThe third component of the scholar\u2019s education is action.\nWithout it, thought \u201ccan never ripen into truth\u201d (CW1:\n59). Action is the process whereby what is not fully formed passes\ninto expressive consciousness. Life is the scholar\u2019s\n\u201cdictionary\u201d (CW1: 60), the source for what she has to\nsay: \u201cOnly so much do I know as I have lived\u201d (CW1:59).\nThe true scholar speaks from experience, not in imitation of others;\nher words, as Emerson puts it, are \u201care loaded with\nlife\u2026\u201d (CW1: 59). The scholar\u2019s education in\noriginal experience and self-expression is appropriate, according to\nEmerson, not only for a small class of people, but for everyone. Its\ngoal is the creation of a democratic nation. Only when we learn to\n\u201cwalk on our own feet\u201d and to \u201cspeak our own\nminds,\u201d he holds, will a nation \u201cfor the first time\nexist\u201d (CW1: 70).\n\nEmerson returned to the topic of education late in his career in\n\u201cEducation,\u201d an address he gave in various versions at\ngraduation exercises in the 1860s. Self-reliance appears in the essay\nin his discussion of respect. The \u201csecret of Education,\u201d\nhe states, \u201clies in respecting the pupil.\u201d It is not for\nthe teacher to choose what the pupil will know and do, but for the\npupil to discover \u201chis own secret.\u201d The teacher must\ntherefore \u201cwait and see the new product of Nature\u201d (E:\n143), guiding and disciplining when appropriate-not with the aim of\nencouraging repetition or imitation, but with that of finding the new\npower that is each child\u2019s gift to the world. The aim of\neducation is to \u201ckeep\u201d the child\u2019s \u201cnature and\narm it with knowledge in the very direction in which it points\u201d\n(E: 144). This aim is sacrificed in mass education, Emerson warns.\nInstead of educating \u201cmasses,\u201d we must educate\n\u201creverently, one by one,\u201d with the attitude that\n\u201cthe whole world is needed for the tuition of each pupil\u201d\n(E: 154).\n2.2 Process\n\nEmerson is in many ways a process philosopher, for whom the universe\nis fundamentally in flux and \u201cpermanence is but a word of\ndegrees\u201d (CW 2: 179). Even as he talks of \u201cBeing,\u201d\nEmerson represents it not as a stable \u201cwall\u201d but as a\nseries of \u201cinterminable oceans\u201d (CW3: 42). This\nmetaphysical position has epistemological correlates: that there is no\nfinal explanation of any fact, and that each law will be incorporated\nin \u201csome more general law presently to disclose itself\u201d\n(CW2: 181). Process is the basis for the succession of moods Emerson\ndescribes in \u201cExperience,\u201d (CW3: 30), and for the emphasis\non the present throughout his philosophy.\n\nSome of Emerson\u2019s most striking ideas about morality and truth\nfollow from his process metaphysics: that no virtues are final or\neternal, all being \u201cinitial,\u201d (CW2: 187); that truth is a\nmatter of glimpses, not steady views. We have a choice, Emerson writes\nin \u201cIntellect,\u201d \u201cbetween truth and repose,\u201d\nbut we cannot have both (CW2: 202). Fresh truth, like the thoughts of\ngenius, comes always as a surprise, as what Emerson calls \u201cthe\nnewness\u201d (CW3: 40). He therefore looks for a \u201ccertain\nbrief experience, which surprise[s] me in the highway or in the\nmarket, in some place, at some time\u2026\u201d (CW1: 213). This is\nan experience that cannot be repeated by simply returning to a place\nor to an object such as a painting. A great disappointment of life,\nEmerson finds, is that one can only \u201csee\u201d certain pictures\nonce, and that the stories and people who fill a day or an hour with\npleasure and insight are not able to repeat the performance.\n\nEmerson\u2019s basic view of religion also coheres with his emphasis\non process, for he holds that one finds God only in the present:\n\u201cGod is, not was\u201d (CW1:89). In contrast, what Emerson\ncalls \u201chistorical Christianity\u201d (CW1: 82) proceeds\n\u201cas if God were dead\u201d (CW1: 84). Even history, which seems\nobviously about the past, has its true use, Emerson holds, as the\nservant of the present: \u201cThe student is to read history actively\nand not passively; to esteem his own life the text, and books the\ncommentary\u201d (CW2: 5).\n2.3 Morality\n\nEmerson\u2019s views about morality are intertwined with his\nmetaphysics of process, and with his perfectionism, his idea that life\nhas the goal of passing into \u201chigher forms\u201d (CW3:14). The\ngoal remains, but the forms of human life, including the virtues, are\nall \u201cinitial\u201d (CW2: 187). The word \u201cinitial\u201d\nsuggests the verb \u201cinitiate,\u201d and one interpretation of\nEmerson\u2019s claim that \u201call virtues are initial\u201d is\nthat virtues initiate historically developing forms of life, such as\nthose of the Roman nobility or the Confucian junxi. Emerson\ndoes have a sense of morality as developing historically, but in the\ncontext in \u201cCircles\u201d where his statement appears he\npresses a more radical and skeptical position: that our virtues often\nmust be abandoned rather than developed. \u201cThe terror of\nreform,\u201d he writes, \u201cis the discovery that we must cast\naway our virtues, or what we have always esteemed such, into the same\npit that has consumed our grosser vices\u201d (CW2: 187). The\nqualifying phrase \u201cor what we have always esteemed such\u201d\nmeans that Emerson does not embrace an easy relativism, according to\nwhich what is taken to be a virtue at any time must actually be a\nvirtue. Yet he does cast a pall of suspicion over all established\nmodes of thinking and acting. The proper standpoint from which to\nsurvey the virtues is the \u2018new moment\u2018 \u2014 what he\nelsewhere calls truth rather than repose (CW2:202) \u2014 in which\nwhat once seemed important may appear \u201ctrivial\u201d or\n\u201cvain\u201d (CW2:189). From this perspective (or more properly\nthe developing set of such perspectives) the virtues do not disappear,\nbut they may be fundamentally altered and rearranged.\n\nAlthough Emerson is thus in no position to set forth a system of\nmorality, he nevertheless delineates throughout his work a set of\nvirtues and heroes, and a corresponding set of vices and villains. In\n\u201cCircles\u201d the vices are \u201cforms of old age,\u201d\nand the hero the \u201creceptive, aspiring\u201d youth (CW2:189). In\nthe \u201cDivinity School Address,\u201d the villain is the\n\u201cspectral\u201d preacher whose sermons offer no hint that he\nhas ever lived. \u201cSelf Reliance\u201d condemns virtues that are\nreally \u201cpenances\u201d (CW2: 31), and the philanthropy of\nabolitionists who display an idealized \u201clove\u201d for those\nfar away, but are full of hatred for those close by (CW2: 30).\n\nConformity is the chief Emersonian vice, the opposite or\n\u201caversion\u201d of the virtue of \u201cself-reliance.\u201d\nWe conform when we pay unearned respect to clothing and other symbols\nof status, when we show \u201cthe foolish face of praise\u201d or\nthe \u201cforced smile which we put on in company where we do not\nfeel at ease in answer to conversation which does not interest\nus\u201d (CW2: 32). Emerson criticizes our conformity even to our own\npast actions-when they no longer fit the needs or aspirations of the\npresent. This is the context in which he states that \u201ca foolish\nconsistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little\nstatesmen, philosophers and divines\u201d (CW2: 33). There is wise\nand there is foolish consistency, and it is foolish to be consistent\nif that interferes with the \u201cmain enterprise of the world for\nsplendor, for extent,\u2026the upbuilding of a man\u201d (CW1:\n65).\n\nIf Emerson criticizes much of human life, he nevertheless devotes most\nof his attention to the virtues. Chief among these is what he calls\n\u201cself-reliance.\u201d The phrase connotes originality and\nspontaneity, and is memorably represented in the image of a group of\nnonchalant boys, \u201csure of a dinner\u2026who would disdain as\nmuch as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one\u2026\u201d The\nboys sit in judgment on the world and the people in it, offering a\nfree, \u201cirresponsible\u201d condemnation of those they see as\n\u201csilly\u201d or \u201ctroublesome,\u201d and praise for those\nthey find \u201cinteresting\u201d or \u201celoquent.\u201d (CW2:\n29). The figure of the boys illustrates Emerson\u2019s characteristic\ncombination of the romantic (in the glorification of children) and the\nclassical (in the idea of a hierarchy in which the boys occupy the\nplace of lords or nobles).\n\nAlthough he develops a series of analyses and images of self-reliance,\nEmerson nevertheless destabilizes his own use of the concept.\n\u201cTo talk of reliance,\u201d he writes, \u201cis a poor\nexternal way of speaking. Speak rather of that which relies, because\nit works and is\u201d (CW 2:40). \u2018Self-reliance\u2019 can be\ntaken to mean that there is a self already formed on which we may\nrely. The \u201cself\u201d on which we are to \u201crely\u201d is,\nin contrast, the original self that we are in the process of creating.\nSuch a self, to use a phrase from Nietzsche\u2019s Ecce Homo,\n\u201cbecomes what it is.\u201d\n\nFor Emerson, the best human relationships require the confident and\nindependent nature of the self-reliant. Emerson\u2019s ideal society\nis a confrontation of powerful, independent \u201cgods, talking from\npeak to peak all round Olympus.\u201d There will be a proper distance\nbetween these gods, who, Emerson advises, \u201cshould meet each\nmorning, as from foreign countries, and spending the day together\nshould depart, as into foreign countries\u201d (CW 3:81). Even\n\u201clovers,\u201d he advises, \u201cshould guard their\nstrangeness\u201d (CW3: 82). Emerson portrays himself as preserving\nsuch distance in the cool confession with which he closes\n\u201cNominalist and Realist,\u201d the last of the Essays,\nSecond Series:\n\nI talked yesterday with a pair of philosophers: I endeavored to show\nmy good men that I liked everything by turns and nothing long\u2026.\nCould they but once understand, that I loved to know that they\nexisted, and heartily wished them Godspeed, yet, out of my poverty of\nlife and thought, had no word or welcome for them when they came to\nsee me, and could well consent to their living in Oregon, for any\nclaim I felt on them, it would be a great satisfaction (CW 3:145).\n\n\nThe self-reliant person will \u201cpublish\u201d her results, but\nshe must first learn to detect that spark of originality or genius\nthat is her particular gift to the world. It is not a gift that is\navailable on demand, however, and a major task of life is to meld\ngenius with its expression. \u201cThe man,\u201d Emerson states\n\u201cis only half himself, the other half is his expression\u201d\n(CW 3:4). There are young people of genius, Emerson laments in\n\u201cExperience,\u201d who promise \u201ca new world\u201d but\nnever deliver: they fail to find the focus for their genius\n\u201cwithin the actual horizon of human life\u201d (CW 3:31).\nAlthough Emerson emphasizes our independence and even distance from\none another, then, the payoff for self-reliance is public and social.\nThe scholar finds that the most private and secret of his thoughts\nturn out to be \u201cthe most acceptable, most public, and\nuniversally true\u201d (CW1: 63). And the great \u201crepresentative\nmen\u201d Emerson identifies are marked by their influence on the\nworld. Their names-Plato, Moses, Jesus, Luther, Copernicus, even\nNapoleon-are \u201cploughed into the history of this world\u201d\n(CW1: 80).\n\nAlthough self-reliance is central, it is not the only Emersonian\nvirtue. Emerson also praises a kind of trust, and the practice of a\n\u201cwise skepticism.\u201d There are times, he holds, when we must\nlet go and trust to the nature of the universe: \u201cAs the traveler\nwho has lost his way, throws his reins on his horse\u2019s neck, and\ntrusts to the instinct of the animal to find his road, so must we do\nwith the divine animal who carries us through this world\u201d\n(CW3:16). But the world of flux and conflicting evidence also requires\na kind of epistemological and practical flexibility that Emerson calls\n\u201cwise skepticism\u201d (CW4: 89). His representative skeptic of\nthis sort is Michel de Montaigne, who as portrayed in\nRepresentative Men is no unbeliever, but a man with a strong\nsense of self, rooted in the earth and common life, whose quest is for\nknowledge. He wants \u201ca near view of the best game and the chief\nplayers; what is best in the planet; art and nature, places and\nevents; but mainly men\u201d (CW4: 91). Yet he knows that life is\nperilous and uncertain, \u201ca storm of many elements,\u201d the\nnavigation through which requires a flexible ship, \u201cfit to the\nform of man.\u201d (CW4: 91).\n2.4 Christianity\n\nThe son of a Unitarian minister, Emerson attended Harvard Divinity\nSchool and was employed as a minister for almost three years. Yet he\noffers a deeply felt and deeply reaching critique of Christianity in\nthe \u201cDivinity School Address,\u201d flowing from a line of\nargument he establishes in \u201cThe American Scholar.\u201d If the\none thing in the world of value is the active soul, then religious\ninstitutions, no less than educational institutions, must be judged by\nthat standard. Emerson finds that contemporary Christianity deadens\nrather than activates the spirit. It is an \u201cEastern monarchy of\na Christianity\u201d in which Jesus, originally the \u201cfriend of\nman,\u201d is made the enemy and oppressor of man. A Christianity\ntrue to the life and teachings of Jesus should inspire \u201cthe\nreligious sentiment\u201d \u2014 a joyous seeing that is more likely\nto be found in \u201cthe pastures,\u201d or \u201ca boat in the\npond\u201d than in a church. Although Emerson thinks it is a calamity\nfor a nation to suffer the \u201closs of worship\u201d (CW1: 89) he\nfinds it strange that, given the \u201cfamine of our churches\u201d\n(CW1: 85) anyone should attend them. He therefore calls on the\nDivinity School graduates to breathe new life into the old forms of\ntheir religion, to be friends and exemplars to their parishioners, and\nto remember \u201cthat all men have sublime thoughts; that all men\nvalue the few real hours of life; they love to be heard; they love to\nbe caught up into the vision of principles\u201d (CW1: 90).\n2.5 Power\n\nPower is a theme in Emerson\u2019s early writing, but it becomes\nespecially prominent in such middle- and late-career essays as\n\u201cExperience,\u201d \u201cMontaigne, or the Skeptic\u201d\n\u201cNapoleon,\u201d and \u201cPower.\u201d Power is related to\naction in \u201cThe American Scholar,\u201d where Emerson holds that\na \u201ctrue scholar grudges every opportunity of action past by, as\na loss of power\u201d (CW1: 59). It is also a subject of\n\u201cSelf-Reliance,\u201d where Emerson writes of each person that\n\u201cthe power which resides in him is new in nature\u201d (CW2:\n28). In \u201cExperience\u201d Emerson speaks of a life which\n\u201cis not intellectual or critical, but sturdy\u201d (CW3: 294);\nand in \u201cPower\u201d he celebrates the \u201cbruisers\u201d\n(CW6: 34) of the world who express themselves rudely and get their\nway. The power in which Emerson is interested, however, is more\nartistic and intellectual than political or military. In a\ncharacteristic passage from \u201cPower,\u201d he states:\n\nIn history the great moment, is, when the savage is just ceasing to be\na savage, with all his hairy Pelasgic strength directed on his opening\nsense of beauty:-and you have Pericles and Phidias,-not yet passed\nover into the Corinthian civility. Everything good in nature and the\nworld is in that moment of transition, when the swarthy juices still\nflow plentifully from nature, but their astringency or acridity is got\nout by ethics and humanity. (CW6: 37\u20138)\n\n\nPower is all around us, but it cannot always be controlled. It is like\n\u201ca bird which alights nowhere,\u201d hopping \u201cperpetually\nfrom bough to bough\u201d (CW3: 34). Moreover, we often cannot tell\nat the time when we exercise our power that we are doing so: happily\nwe sometimes find that much is accomplished in \u201ctimes when we\nthought ourselves indolent\u201d (CW3: 28).\n2.6 Unity and Moods\n\nAt some point in many of his essays and addresses, Emerson enunciates,\nor at least refers to, a great vision of unity. He speaks in\n\u201cThe American Scholar\u201d of an \u201coriginal unit\u201d\nor \u201cfountain of power\u201d (CW1: 53), of which each of us is a\npart. He writes in \u201cThe Divinity School Address\u201d that each\nof us is \u201can inlet into the deeps of Reason.\u201d And in\n\u201cSelf-Reliance,\u201d the essay that more than any other\ncelebrates individuality, he writes of \u201cthe resolution of all\ninto the ever-blessed ONE\u201d (CW2: 40). \u201cThe Oversoul\u201d\nis Emerson\u2019s most sustained discussion of \u201cthe ONE,\u201d\nbut he does not, even there, shy away from the seeming conflict\nbetween the reality of process and the reality of an ultimate\nmetaphysical unity. How can the vision of succession and the vision of\nunity be reconciled?\n\nEmerson never comes to a clear or final answer. One solution he both\nsuggests and rejects is an unambiguous idealism, according to which a\nnontemporal \u201cOne\u201d or \u201cOversoul\u201d is the only\nreality, and all else is illusion. He suggests this, for example, in\nthe many places where he speaks of waking up out of our dreams or\nnightmares. But he then portrays that to which we awake not simply as\nan unchanging \u201cONE,\u201d but as a process or succession: a\n\u201cgrowth\u201d or \u201cmovement of the soul\u201d (CW2: 189);\nor a \u201cnew yet unapproachable America\u201d (CW3: 259).\n\nEmerson undercuts his visions of unity (as of everything else) through\nwhat Stanley Cavell calls his \u201cepistemology of moods.\u201d\nAccording to this epistemology, most fully developed in\n\u201cExperience\u201d but present in all of Emerson\u2019s\nwriting, we never apprehend anything \u201cstraight\u201d or\nin-itself, but only under an aspect or mood. Emerson writes that life\nis \u201ca train of moods like a string of beads,\u201d through\nwhich we see only what lies in each bead\u2019s focus (CW3: 30). The\nbeads include our temperaments, our changing moods, and the\n\u201cLords of Life\u201d which govern all human experience. The\nLords include \u201cSuccession,\u201d \u201cSurface,\u201d\n\u201cDream,\u201d \u201cReality,\u201d and\n\u201cSurprise.\u201d Are the great visions of unity, then, simply\naspects under which we view the world?\n\nEmerson\u2019s most direct attempt to reconcile succession and unity,\nor the one and the many, occurs in the last essay in the Essays,\nSecond Series, entitled \u201cNominalist and Realist.\u201d\nThere he speaks of the universe as an \u201cold Two-face\u2026of\nwhich any proposition may be affirmed or denied\u201d (CW3: 144). As\nin \u201cExperience,\u201d Emerson leaves us with the whirling\nsuccession of moods. \u201cI am always insincere,\u201d he\nskeptically concludes, \u201cas always knowing there are other\nmoods\u201d (CW3: 145). But Emerson enacts as well as describes the\nsuccession of moods, and he ends \u201cNominalist and Realist\u201d\nwith the \u201cfeeling that all is yet unsaid,\u201d and with at\nleast the idea of some universal truth (CW3: 363).\n3. Emerson on Slavery and Race\n\nMassachusetts ended slavery in 1783, when Chief Justice William\nCushing instructed the jury in the case of Quock Walker, a former\nslave, that \u201cthe idea of slavery\u201d was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the\nMassachusetts Constitution\u2019 guarantee that \u201call men are born free and\nequal\u201d (Gougeon, 71). Emerson first encountered slavery when he\nwent south for his health in the winter of 1827, when he was 23. He\nrecorded the following scene in his journal from his time in\nTallahasse, Florida: \n\n\nA fortnight since I attended a meeting of the Bible Society. The\nTreasurer of this institution is Marshal of the district & by a\nsomewhat unfortunate arrangement had appointed a special meeting of\nthe Society & a Slave Auction at the same time & place, one\nbeing in the Government house & the other in the adjoining yard.\nOne ear therefore heard the glad tidings of great joy whilst the other\nwas regaled with \u201cGoing gentlemen, Going!\u201d And almost without changing\nour position we might aid in sending the scriptures into Africa or bid\nfor \u201cfour children without the mother who had been kidnapped\ntherefrom\u201d (JMN3: 117).\n\n\nEmerson never questioned the iniquity of slavery, though it was not a\nmain item on his intellectual agenda until the eighteen forties. He\nrefers to abolition in the \u201cProspects\u201d chapter of Nature when\nhe speaks of the \u201cgleams of a better light\u201d in the darkness of history\nand gives as examples \u201cthe abolition of the Slave-trade,\u201d \u201cthe history\nof Jesus Christ,\u201d and \u201cthe wisdom of children\u201d (CW1:43). He condemns\nslavery in some of his greatest essays, \u201cSelf-Reliance\u201d (1841), so\nthat even if we didn\u2019t have the anti-slavery addresses of the 1840s\nand 1850s, we would still have evidence both of the existence of\nslavery and of Emerson\u2019s opposition to it. He praises \u201cthe bountiful\ncause of Abolition,\u201d although he laments that the cause had been\ntaken over by \u201cangry bigots.\u201d Later in the essay he\ntreats abolition as one of the great causes and movements of\nworld history, along with Christianity, the Reformation, and\nMethodism. In a well-known statement he writes that an \u201cinstitution is\nthe shadow of one man,\u201d giving as examples \u201cthe Reformation, of\nLuther; Quakerism, of Fox; Methodism, of Wesley; Abolition of\nClarkson\u201d (CW2: 35). The unfamiliar name in this list is that of\nThomas Clarkson (1760\u20131846), a Cambridge-educated clergyman who helped\nfound the British Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade.\nClarkson travelled on horseback throughout Britain, interviewing\nsailors who worked on slaving ships, and exhibiting such tools as\nmanacles, thumbscews, branding irons, and other tools of the trade.\nHis  History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment\nof the Abolition of the African Slave Trade by the British\nParliament (1808) would be a major source for Emerson\u2019s\nanti-slavery addresses.\n\nSlavery also appears in \u201cPolitics,\u201d from the Essays, Second\nSeries of 1844, when Emerson surveys the two main American\nparties. One, standing for free trade, wide suffrage, and the access\nof the young and poor to wealth and power, has the \u201cbest cause\u201d but\nthe least attractive leaders; while the other has the most\ncultivated and able leaders, but is \u201cmerely defensive of property.\u201d\nThis conservative party, moreover, \u201cvindicates no right, it aspires to\nno real good, it brands no crime, it proposes no generous policy, it\ndoes  not build nor write, nor cherish the arts, nor foster\nreligion, nor establish schools, nor encourage science, nor emancipate\nthe slave, nor befriend the poor, or the Indian, or the immigrant\u201d\n(CW3: 124). Emerson stands here for emancipation, not simply for the\nending of the slave trade.\n\n1844 was also the year of Emerson\u2019s breakout anti-slavery address,\nwhich he gave at the annual celebration of the abolition of slavery in\nthe British West Indies. In the background was the American war with\nMexico, the annexation of Texas, and the likelihood that it would be\nentering the Union as a slave state. Although Concord was a hotbed of\nabolitionism compared to Boston, there were many conservatives in the\ntown. No church allowed Emerson to speak on the subject, and when the\ncourthouse was secured for the talk, the sexton refused to ring\nthe church bell to announce it, a task the young Henry David Thoreau\ntook upon himself to perform (Gougeon, 75). In his address, Emerson\ndevelops a critique of the language we use to speak about, or to avoid\nspeaking about, black slavery:\n\n\nLanguage must be raked, the secrets of slaughter-houses and infamous\nholes that cannot front the day, must be ransacked, to tell what\nnegro-slavery has been. These men, our benefactors, as they are\nproducers of corn and wine, of coffee, of tobacco, of cotton, of\nsugar, of rum, and brandy, gentle and joyous themselves, and producers\nof comfort and luxury for the civilized world.\u2026 I am heart-sick\nwhen I read how they came there, and how they are kept there. Their\ncase was left out of the mind and out of the heart of their\nbrothers (Emerson\u2019s Antislavery Writings, 9).\n\n\nEmerson\u2019s long address is both clear-eyed about the evils of slavery\nand hopeful about the possibilities of the Africans. Speaking\nwith the black abolitionist Frederick Douglass beside him on the\ndais, Emerson states: \u201cThe black man carries in his bosom an\nindispensable element of a new and coming civilization.\u201d He praises\n\u201csuch men as\u201d Toussaint [L]Ouverture, leader of the Haitian slave\nrebellion, and announces: \u201chere is the anti-slave: here\nis man; and if you have man, black or white is an\ninsignificance.\u201d (Wirzrbicki, 95; Emerson\u2019s Antislavery\nWritings, 31). \n\nThe Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 effectively nationalized slavery,\nrequiring officials and citizens of the free states to assist in\nreturning escaped slaves to their owners. Emerson\u2019s 1851 \u201cAddress to\nthe Citizens of Concord\u201d  calls both for the abrogation of the\nlaw and for disobeying it while it is still current. In 1854, the\nescaped slave Anthony Burns was shipped back to Virginia by order of\nthe Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court, an order carried\nout by U. S. Marines, in accordance with the new law. This\nexample of \u201cSlavery in Massachusetts\u201d (as Henry Thoreau put it in a\nwell-known address) is in the background of Emerson\u2019s 1855 \u201cLecture on\nSlavery,\u201d where he calls the  recognition of slavery by the\noriginal 1787 Constitution a \u201ccrime.\u201d Emerson gave these and other\nantislavery addresses multiple times in various places from\nthe late 1840s till the beginning of the Civil War. On\nthe eve of the war Emerson supported John Brown, the violent\nabolitionist who was executed in 1859 by the U. S. government after he\nattacked the U. S. armory in Harper\u2019s Ferry, West Virginia.  In\nthe middle of the War, Emerson raised funds for black regiments of\nUnion soldiers (Wirzbicki, 251\u20132) and read his \u201cBoston Hymn\u201d to\nan audience of 3000 celebrating President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s\nEmancipation Proclamation of 1863. \u201cPay ransom to the owner,\u201d Emerson\nwrote, \u201cand fill the bag to the brim. Who is the owner? The slave is\nowner. And ever was. Pay him\u201d (CW9: 383).\n\nEmerson\u2019s magisterial essay \u201cFate,\u201d published in The Conduct of\nLife (1860) is distinguished not only by its attempt to reconcile\nfreedom and necessity, but by disturbing pronouncements about fate and\nrace, for example: \n\n\nThe population of the world is a conditional population, not the best,\nbut the best that could live now; and the scale of tribes, and the\nsteadiness with which victory adheres to one tribe, and defeat to\nanother, is as uniform as the superposition of strata. We know in\nhistory what weight belongs to race. We see the English, French, and\nGermans planting themselves on every shore and market of America and\nAustralia, and monopolizing the commerce of these countries. We like\nthe nervous and victorious habit of our own branch of the family. We\nfollow the step of the Jew, of the Indian, of the Negro. We see how\nmuch will has been expended to extinguish the Jew, in vain.\u2026 The\nGerman and Irish millions, like the Negro, have a great deal of guano\nin their destiny. They are ferried over the Atlantic, and carted over\nAmerica, to ditch and to drudge, to make corn cheap, and then to lie\ndown prematurely to make a spot of green grass on the prairie (CW6:\n8\u20139).\n\n\nThe references to race here show the influence of a new \u201cscientific\u201d\ninterest in both England and America in the role that race\u2014often\nconflated with culture or nation\u2014plays in human evolution. In\nAmerica, this interest was entangled with the institution of slavery,\nthe encounters with Native American tribes, and with the notion of\n\u201cAnglo-Saxon liberties\u201d that came to prominence during the American\nRevolution, and developed into the idea that there was an Anglo-Saxon\nrace (see Horsman).\n\nEmerson would not be Emerson, however, if he did not conduct a\ncritique of his terms, and \u201crace\u201d is a case in point. He takes it up in\na non-American context, however: in the essay \u201cRace\u201d from English\nTraits (1856). Emerson\u2019s critique of his title begins in the\nessay\u2019s first paragraph when he writes that \u201ceach variety shades down\nimperceptibly into the next, and you cannot draw the line where a race\nbegins or ends.\u201d Civilization \u201ceats away the old traits,\u201d he\ncontinues, and religions construct new forms of character that\ncut against old racial divisions. More deeply still, he\nidentifies considerations that \u201cthreaten to undermine\u201d the concept of\nrace. The \u201cfixity \u2026 of races as we see them,\u201d he writes, \u201cis a weak\nargument for the eternity of these frail boundaries, since all our\nhistorical period is a point\u201d in the long duration of nature (CW\n5:24). The patterns we see today aren\u2019t pure anyway:\n\n\nthough we flatter the self-love of men and nations by the legend of\npure races, all our experience is of the gradation and resolution of\nraces, and strange resemblances meet us every where, It need not\npuzzle us that Malay and Papuan, Celt and Roman, Saxon and Tartar\nshould mix, when we see the rudiments of tiger and baboon in our human\nform, and know that the barriers of races are not so firm, but that\nsome spray sprinkles us from the antidiluvian seas.\n\n\nAs in Nature and his great early works, Emerson asserts our\nintimate relations with the natural world, from the oceans to the\nanimals. Why, one might think, should one of the higher but still\ninitial forms be singled out for separation, abasement, and slavery?\nEmerson works out his views in \u201cRace\u201d without referring to\nAmerican slavery, however, in a book about England where he sees a\nhealthy mixture, not a pure race. England\u2019s history, he writes,\nis not so much \u201cone of certain tribes of Saxons, Jutes, or\nFrisians, coming from one place, and genetically identical, as it is\nan anthology of temperaments out of them all.\u2026 The English\nderive their pedigree from such a range of nationalities.\u2026 The\nScandinavians in her race still hear in every age the murmurs of their\nmother, the ocean; the Briton in the blood hugs the homestead\nstill\u201d (CW5: 28). Still, it is striking that Emerson never\nmentions slavery in either \u201cFate\u201d or \u201cRace,\u201d\nboth of which were written during his intense period of public\nopposition to American slavery.\n4. Some Questions about Emerson\n4.1 Consistency\n\nEmerson routinely invites charges of inconsistency. He says the world\nis fundamentally a process and fundamentally a unity; that it resists\nthe imposition of our will and that it flows with the power of our\nimagination; that travel is good for us, since it adds to our\nexperience, and that it does us no good, since we wake up in the new\nplace only to find the same \u201c sad self\u201d we thought we had\nleft behind (CW2: 46).\n\nEmerson\u2019s \u201cepistemology of moods\u201d is an attempt to\nconstruct a framework for encompassing what might otherwise seem\ncontradictory outlooks, viewpoints, or doctrines. Emerson really means\nto \u201caccept,\u201d as he puts it, \u201cthe clangor and jangle\nof contrary tendencies\u201d (CW3: 36). He means to be irresponsible\nto all that holds him back from his self-development. That is why, at\nthe end of \u201cCircles,\u201d he writes that he is \u201conly an\nexperimenter\u2026with no Past at my back\u201d (CW2: 188). In the\nworld of flux that he depicts in that essay, there is nothing stable\nto be responsible to: \u201cevery moment is new; the past is always\nswallowed and forgotten, the coming only is sacred\u201d (CW2:\n189).\n\nDespite this claim, there is considerable consistency in\nEmerson\u2019s essays and among his ideas. To take just one example,\nthe idea of the \u201cactive soul\u201d \u2013 mentioned as the\n\u201cone thing in the world, of value\u201d in \u2018The American\nScholar\u2019 \u2013 is a presupposition of Emerson\u2019s attack\non \u201cthe famine of the churches\u201d (for not feeding or\nactivating the souls of those who attend them); it is an element in\nhis understanding of a poem as \u201ca thought so passionate and\nalive, that, like the spirit of a plant or an animal, it has an\narchitecture of its own \u2026\u201d (CW3: 6); and, of course, it\nis at the center of Emerson\u2019s idea of self-reliance. There are\nin fact multiple paths of coherence through Emerson\u2019s\nphilosophy, guided by ideas discussed previously: process, education,\nself-reliance, and the present.\n4.2 Early and Late Emerson\n\nIt is hard for an attentive reader not to feel that there are\nimportant differences between early and late Emerson: for example,\nbetween the buoyant Nature (1836) and the weary ending of\n\u201cExperience\u201d (1844); between the expansive author of\n\u201cSelf-Reliance\u201d (1841) and the burdened writer of\n\u201cFate\u201d (1860). Emerson himself seems to advert to such\ndifferences when he writes in \u201cFate\u201d: \u201cOnce we\nthought, positive power was all. Now we learn that negative power, or\ncircumstance, is half\u201d (CW6: 8). Is \u201cFate\u201d the\nrecord of a lesson Emerson had not absorbed in his early writing,\nconcerning the multiple ways in which circumstances over which we have\nno control \u2014 plagues, hurricanes, temperament, sexuality, old\nage \u2014 constrain self-reliance or self-development?\n\n\u201cExperience\u201d is a key transitional essay. \u201cWhere do\nwe find ourselves?\u201d is the question with which it begins. The\nanswer is not a happy one, for Emerson finds that we occupy a place of\ndislocation and obscurity, where \u201csleep lingers all our lifetime\nabout our eyes, as night hovers all day in the boughs of the\nfir-tree\u201d (CW3: 27). An event hovering over the essay, but not\ndisclosed until its third paragraph, is the death of his five-year old\nson Waldo. Emerson finds in this episode and his reaction to it an\nexample of an \u201cunhandsome\u201d general character of\nexistence-it is forever slipping away from us, like his little\nboy.\n\n\u201cExperience\u201d presents many moods. It has its moments of\nillumination, and its considered judgment that there is an\n\u201cIdeal journeying always with us, the heaven without rent or\nseam\u201d (CW3: 41). It offers wise counsel about \u201cskating\nover the surfaces of life\u201d and confining our existence to the\n\u201cmid-world.\u201d But even its upbeat ending takes place in a\nsetting of substantial \u201cdefeat.\u201d \u201cUp again, old\nheart!\u201d a somewhat battered voice states in the last sentence of\nthe essay. Yet the essay ends with an assertion that in its great hope\nand underlying confidence chimes with some of the more expansive\npassages in Emerson\u2019s writing. The \u201ctrue romance which the\nworld exists to realize,\u201d he states, \u201cwill be the\ntransformation of genius into practical power\u201d (CW3: 49).\n\nDespite important differences in tone and emphasis, Emerson\u2019s\nassessment of our condition remains much the same throughout his\nwriting. There are no more dire indictments of ordinary human life\nthan in the early work, \u201cThe American Scholar,\u201d where\nEmerson states that \u201cMen in history, men in the world of to-day,\nare bugs, are spawn, and are called \u2018the mass\u2019 and\n\u2018the herd.\u2019 In a century, in a millennium, one or two men;\nthat is to say, one or two approximations to the right state of every\nman\u201d (CW1: 65). Conversely, there is no more idealistic\nstatement in his early work than the statement in \u201cFate\u201d\nthat \u201c[t]hought dissolves the material universe, by carrying the\nmind up into a sphere where all is plastic\u201d (CW6: 15). All in\nall, the earlier work expresses a sunnier hope for human\npossibilities, the sense that Emerson and his contemporaries were\npoised for a great step forward and upward; and the later work, still\nhopeful and assured, operates under a weight or burden, a stronger\nsense of the dumb resistance of the world.\n4.3 Sources and Influence\n\nEmerson read widely, and gave credit in his essays to the scores of\nwriters from whom he learned. He kept lists of literary,\nphilosophical, and religious thinkers in his journals and worked at\ncategorizing them.\n\nAmong the most important writers for the shape of Emerson\u2019s\nphilosophy are Plato and the Neoplatonist line extending through\nPlotinus, Proclus, Iamblichus, and the Cambridge Platonists. Equally\nimportant are writers in the Kantian and Romantic traditions (which\nEmerson probably learned most about from Coleridge\u2019s\nBiographia Literaria). Emerson read avidly in Indian,\nespecially Hindu, philosophy, and in Confucianism. There are also\nmultiple empiricist, or experience-based influences, flowing from\nBerkeley, Wordsworth and other English Romantics, Newton\u2019s\nphysics, and the new sciences of geology and comparative anatomy.\nOther writers whom Emerson often mentions are Anaxagoras, St.\nAugustine, Francis Bacon, Jacob Behmen, Cicero, Goethe, Heraclitus,\nLucretius, Mencius, Pythagoras, Schiller, Thoreau, August and\nFriedrich Schlegel, Shakespeare, Socrates, Madame de Sta\u00ebl and\nEmanuel Swedenborg.\n\nEmerson\u2019s works were well known throughout the United States and\nEurope in his day. Nietzsche read German translations of\nEmerson\u2019s essays, copied passages from \u201cHistory\u201d and\n\u201cSelf-Reliance\u201d in his journals, and wrote of the\nEssays: that he had never \u201cfelt so much at home in a\nbook.\u201d Emerson\u2019s ideas about \u201cstrong,\noverflowing\u201d heroes, friendship as a battle, education, and\nrelinquishing control in order to gain it, can be traced in\nNietzsche\u2019s writings. Other Emersonian ideas-about transition,\nthe ideal in the commonplace, and the power of human will permeate the\nwritings of such classical American pragmatists as William James and\nJohn Dewey.\n\nStanley Cavell\u2019s engagement with Emerson is the most original\nand prolonged by any philosopher, and Emerson is a primary source for\nhis writing on \u201cmoral perfectionism.\u201d In his earliest\nessays on Emerson, such as \u201cThinking of Emerson\u201d and\n\u201cEmerson, Coleridge, Kant,\u201d Cavell considers\nEmerson\u2019s place in the Kantian tradition, and he explores the\naffinity between Emerson\u2019s call in \u201cThe American\nScholar\u201d for a return to \u201cthe common and the low\u201d\nand Wittgenstein\u2019s quest for a return to ordinary language. In\n\u201cBeing Odd, Getting Even\u201d and \u201cAversive\nThinking,\u201d Cavell considers Emerson\u2019s anticipations of\nexistentialism, and in these and other works he explores\nEmerson\u2019s affinities with Nietzsche and Heidegger.\n\nIn Conditions Handsome and Unhandsome and Cities of\nWords, Cavell develops what he calls \u201cEmersonian moral\nperfectionism,\u201d of which he finds an exemplary expression in\nEmerson\u2019s \u201cHistory\u201d: \u201cSo all that is said of\nthe wise man by Stoic, or oriental or modern essayist, describes to\neach reader his own idea, describes his unattained but attainable\nself.\u201d Emersonian perfectionism is oriented towards a wiser or\nbetter self that is never final, always initial, always on the\nway.\n\nCavell does not have a neat and tidy definition of perfectionism, and\nhis list of perfectionist works ranges from Plato\u2019s\nRepublic to Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical\nInvestigations, but he identifies \u201ctwo dominating themes of\nperfectionism\u201d in Emerson\u2019s writing: (1) \u201cthat the\nhuman self \u2026 is always becoming, as on a journey, always\npartially in a further state. This journey is described as education\nor cultivation\u201d; (2) \u201cthat the other to whom I can use the\nwords I discover in which to express myself is the Friend\u2014a\nfigure that may occur as the goal of the journey but also as its\ninstigation and accompaniment\u201d (Cities of Words,\n26\u20137). The friend can be a person but it may also be a text. In\nthe sentence from \u201cHistory\u201d cited above, the writing of\nthe \u201cStoic, or oriental or modern essayist\u201d about\n\u201cthe wise man\u201d functions as a friend and guide, describing\nto each reader not just any idea, but \u201chis own idea.\u201d This\nis the text as instigator and companion.\n\nCavell\u2019s engagement with perfectionism springs from a response\nto his colleague John Rawls, who in A Theory of Justice\ncondemns Nietzsche (and implicitly Emerson) for his statement that\n\u201cmankind must work continually to produce individual great human\nbeings.\u201d \u201cPerfectionism,\u201d Rawls states, \u201cis\ndenied as a political principle.\u201d Cavell replies that\nEmerson\u2019s (and Nietzsche\u2019s) focus on the great man has\nnothing to do with a transfer of economic resources or political\npower, or with the idea that \u201cthere is a separate class of great\nmen \u2026for whose good, and conception of good, the rest of\nsociety is to live\u201d (CHU, 49). The great man or woman, Cavell\nholds, is required for rather than opposed to democracy:\n\u201cessential to the criticism of democracy from within\u201d\n(CHU, 3).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works by Emerson", "Selected Writings on Emerson"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works by Emerson": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "[<strong>CW</strong>] <em>The Collected Works of Ralph\nWaldo Emerson</em>, ed.
