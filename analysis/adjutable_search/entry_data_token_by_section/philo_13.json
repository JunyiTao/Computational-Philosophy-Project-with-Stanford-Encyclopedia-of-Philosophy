    "main_text": "Major Philosophical Themes and Methods in Philo || Creation and anthropology\n4.5 Creation and anthropology\n\nThe De opificio was often defined as a Jewish version of the\nTimaeus (Sterling 1993). In this treatise, Philo proclaims,\nagainst Aristotelianism and Stoicism, that God is the unique Creator\nboth of the models for the world and of the world itself. That does\nnot prevent him from drawing upon patterns elaborated in the somewhat\nconfused but rich period at the end of the first century BCE. The\nevaluation of the most common model of cosmological creation in the\nDe opificio, that of an active power acting on unqualified\nmatter, is difficult since Philo seems to affirm that God created the\nworld ex nihilo in some passages. It is probable that there\nwas no significant difference between unqualified matter and pure void\nfor him. God\u2019s first task\u2014though Philo refuses to admit\nthe historicity of Creation (Runia 2001: 156\u2013162)\u2014was\nacting as architect to elaborate His project, i.e., to structure the\nintelligible world, conceived as the model of the corporeal one and\nestablished in the logos. The chief contents of the\nincorporeal cosmos were heaven, an invisible earth, air and void,\nwater, spirit, and light. After the creation of the firmament and of\nthe earth, on the fourth day God proceeded to order the heaven and to\nadorn it with splendid heavenly bodies. The explanation of this fourth\nday is especially interesting given the following elements:\n\n\n\nGod has absolute liberty, and creates the less-important earth before\nthe more-important celestial bodies.\n\n\nHe knows what the then non-existent human beings will think and wants\nto prevent them from thinking that the movement of the celestial\nbodies is the cause of everything. This could be called the Chaldean\ntemptation, not without similarities to Stoicism, and is an obsessive\nfear of Philo\u2019s.\n\n\nAt this point he begins an extensive section on Pythagorean\narithmology, including a meditation on the perfection of the number\nfour.\n\n\nOn the fifth day, God creates the living beings according to a\nscala naturae replete with Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic\nechoes. As has been remarked, there is a crucial difference between\nPlato and Philo on this point (Runia 2001: 213). While \u201cthe\ncreational sequence\u201d is descending in the former, in the\nAlexandrian exegetes\u2014who aim to defend the Biblical\naccount\u2014it ascends. Between the fishes, which are the first\ncreated, and man, crown of Creation, are birds and land animals. The\ncreation of man, on the sixth day, is for Philo an occasion to develop\nsome of his main themes: the resemblance of the human being to God,\nbased on the Platonic and Stoic idea that the intellect holds the same\nposition in the human being that the Great Creator holds in the\ncosmos; the concept of the powers of God, introduced with his exegesis\nof the words, \u201clet us make a human being after our image and\nlikeness\u201d. In fact, argues Philo, God needed no one to create\nthe human being, but preferred that human sins not be attributed to\nHim. In addition, he cites the Platonic idea of contemplation leading\nto philosophy, a risky idea since it could lead to such a fascination\nwith worldly things that the Creator would be forgotten and denied, as\nwas the case with the Chaldeans. After a long arithmologic meditation\non the hebdomad, the seventh day or Shabbat, Philo arrives at original\nsin. It is said that the first man (the name Adam is never evoked) was\nmost excellent in his body as well as his soul. He lived in perfect\nharmony with nature, homeless, but the cosmos was his home and city,\nwhere he resided with complete safety. God ascribed to the first man\nthe imposition of names, a philosophical theme with strong Platonic\nconnotations. In the following paragraphs Philo explains his descent\ninto wickedness by the creation of woman. The sentence \u201cwoman\nbecomes for him the starting point of a blameworthy life\u201d has\naroused many criticisms of misogyny on Philo\u2019s part. It would be\nabsurd to deny that there are many offensive assertions regarding\nwomen in his work. Woman is the symbol of sensation, man that of\nreason. These problems are essential in that they deal with sexuality,\nethics and ontology alike. Without trying to defend Philo\nsystematically, one must however emphasize the first sentence of\nOpif. 151: \n\n\nBut since nothing is stable in the world of becoming, mortal beings\nnecessarily undergo reverses and changes, the first human being too\nhad to enjoy some ill fortune. \n\n\nThe word \u201cnecessarily\u201d means that human responsibility is\nmuch more relative than absolute. The first man could not eternally\nhave a perfect life in a world which was not the intelligible one. In\nStoic doctrine, the similarity between the sage and God is a permanent\none. Philo is much more cautious when saying at Opif. 151:\n\n\n\nAs long as he was single, he resembled God and the cosmos in his\nsolitariness, receiving the delineations of his soul, not all of them\nbut as many as a mortal constitution could contain. \n\n\nEve\u2019s role was inscribed in Adam\u2019s ontological\ninstability. In Philo\u2019s allegorical interpretation, defined not\nas a certainty but a conjecture, the serpent is the symbol of\npleasure. It cannot be said, however, that pleasure is an absolute\nevil in Philo\u2019s thought. It is necessary in the created world\nand it is said in Leg. 2.17 that the new born child makes use\nof it. The defenders of pleasure are not absolutely wrong when they\nsay that offspring feel an affinity with it. Their error is not in\ndefending pleasure but in transforming its auxiliary role into the\nalpha and omega of ethics. The moment of humankind\u2019s fall is\nneither the triumph of evil, nor a victory of individual perversity,\nbut rather the appearance of a contrast between the first man in his\ninitial perfection and a world which, being created on the basis of\nthe intelligible one, could not itself be perfect.\n",
