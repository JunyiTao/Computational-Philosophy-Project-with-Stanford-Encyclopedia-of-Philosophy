    "main_text": "Scientific Methodology\n5. Scientific Methodology\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet herself spent time running extensive experiments to\ngain understanding of various natural phenomena. She set up a lab at\nher estate Cirey in which she and Voltaire both undertook experiments\n(e.g. Walters 1967). Her descriptions of experiments undertaken to\ndetermine the nature and propagation of fire in her Dissertation\non the Nature and Propagation of Fire attest to this fact. She\nwas also well educated on scientific advancements of her day, most\nespecially in astronomy and physics. Her comments in the\nFoundations on scientific methodology focus primarily on her\nanalysis of the method of great astronomers and physicists. Here, we\nfocus on her explicit theorizing on the role of hypotheses in science,\nfor her views on this topic place her clearly at the start of the\nhypothetico-deductive tradition in scientific methodology.\n\n\nAt the close of her chapter on hypotheses, Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s\n writes: [15]\n\n\nAnd so good hypotheses will always be the product of the greatest\nmen. Copernicus, Kepler, Huygens, Descartes, Leibniz, and even Newton\nhimself, have all devised useful hypotheses to explain complicated and\ndifficult phenomena. The example of these great men, and of their\nsuccesses, should make us see that those who wish to ban hypotheses\nfrom philosophy, intend harm to the interests of science\u201d\n(IP\n \u00a771).[16]\n\n\n\nIn this declaration, Du Ch\u00e2telet establishes how out of \nstep\u2014though not necessarily entirely to her detriment\u2014she was\nwith her own milieu. Members of the Royal Society in Britain and\nAcademie Royale in France in the 18th century tended to\neschew the use of hypotheses, preferring what they took to be a\nscientific focus on empirical\n facts.[17]\nMoreover, Newton was seen by\nmany of his admiring contemporaries to have captured the value of the\nSocieties\u2019 approach in his scientific practice and in his famous\n motto hypotheses non\n fingo.[18]\nAmong the most vocal\nspokespersons in eighteenth century France for this approach was none\nother than Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s housemate during her years spent\ndrafting the Foundations, Voltaire who, in his Elements of\nNewton\u2019s Philosophy, contrasts Descartes and Newton along\nexactly these\n lines.[19]\nIn siding with the use of\nhypotheses, in once again lauding Descartes for this aspect of\nhis\n method,[20]\nand in suggesting that\nNewton himself makes use of hypotheses, Du Ch\u00e2telet establishes\nherself as no mere mimic of \u2018greater\u2019 men of her time. The\nfact that this highly innovative chapter survives her massive rewrites\nafter her tutelage under Koenig also throws into question the doubt\ncast upon her originality by Koenig's charge of\nplagiarism. Indeed, close examination of the manuscript of what\nremains of Du Ch\u00e2telet's earliest version of the\nFoundations in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France\ndiscloses that her chapter on hypothesis is much more well-worked out\nthan surrounding chapters, many of which have two significantly edited\ndrafts. This indicates that she may have fairly clear ideas on this\nchapter, even while her thoughts on the rest of the first half of the\nbook are in considerable\n flux.[21]\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet distinguishes those who use hypotheses well from\nthose who use them badly, and she recognizes a third \ngroup\u2014those who eschew the use of hypotheses altogether largely due to\nperceived misuse of them among their predecessors and contemporaries.\nAmong those who use hypotheses poorly are those working in the\nCartesian tradition and those in \u201cthe Schools\u201d who are\nespecially guilty of spouting unintelligible jargon (IP\nAvant-Propos VIII, \u00a755). The key downfalls of those who\nmake bad use of hypotheses are the mistakes of taking them as truth (IP\n\u00a762\u201363), and of building theories and systems upon them that\nresemble \u201cfables\u201d and \u201cdreams\u201d (IP \u00a755)\nmore than they resemble a science of nature firmly rooted in empirical\nknowledge of nature. As a consequence of previous abuse of hypotheses,\nDu Ch\u00e2telet notes that many in her own century have entirely\nshied away from their use\u2014or at least claim to have done \nso\u2014which they regard as (quoting Newton) the \u201cpoison of\nreason and the plague of philosophy\u201d (IP \u00a755). Du\nCh\u00e2telet stresses that it is a mistake, however, to believe that\nhypotheses are useless in physics just because they have been abused in\nthe past (IP \u00a763), and she suggests that hypothetical thinking is\nnot only useful, but indeed necessary; without hypotheses, almost no progress\nwould have been made in astronomy (IP Avant-Propos VIII,\n\u00a757), and they are also valuable in physics (IP \u00a755). She\neven goes so far as to claim \u201cwithout hypotheses\u2026 there\nwould be no astronomy now\u201d (IP \u00a757). To bolster her case,\nshe details a few recent successes in astronomy which relied pivotally\non the use of hypotheses with theories of Copernicus (IP \u00a757 and\n\u00a767), Kepler (IP \u00a758) and Huygens (IP \u00a757 and \u00a767)\nfeatured as evidence. Those who refuse to include hypothetical thinking\nin their scientific method are guilty of retarding the progress of\nscience no less than are those who include such thinking but do so\nbadly (IP \u00a754).\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet believes that hypotheses are necessary\nbecause not all phenomena can be explained through reliance upon first\nprinciples alone\u2014there is a gap between first principles and\nobserved phenomena in the world in the sense that the scientist cannot\ndeduce the cause of those phenomena directly or through chains of\ndeduction from the first principles. Neither can experiment directly\ntease out such a cause. \u201cHypotheses are\u2026 sometimes very\nnecessary\u2026 in all cases when we cannot discover the true reason\nfor a phenomenon and the attendant circumstances, neither a\npriori, by means of truths [identified as principles in \u00a753]\nthat we already know, nor a posteriori, with the help of\nexperiments\u201d (IP \u00a760). And: \u201c[P]hilosophers frame\nhypotheses to explain the phenomena, the cause of which cannot be\ndiscovered either by experiment or by demonstration\u201d (IP\n\u00a756).\n\n\nRecall that for Du Ch\u00e2telet, these first principles include\nepistemological principles\u2014the principles of contradiction and\nsufficient reason (IP \u00a74 and \u00a78). Du Ch\u00e2telet writes\nthat \u201ca hypothesis\u2026 [must] not be in contradiction with\nthe principle of sufficient reason, nor with any principles that are\nthe foundation of our knowledge\u201d (IP \u00a761). But, presumably,\nthe principles constraining the sorts of hypotheses the scientist can\nposit also include metaphysical principles which can be derived\ndirectly from foundational principles of knowledge. For Du\nCh\u00e2telet, as shown above, these include the three-tier\nmetaphysical account she develops, the nature of matter, and so\nforth.\n\n\nIn her opening comments on hypotheses, Du Ch\u00e2telet writes:\n\u201cThe true causes of natural effects and of the phenomena\nwe observe are often so far from the principles on which we can rely\nand the experiments we can make that one is obliged to be content with\nprobable reasons [hypotheses] to explain them\u201d (IP \u00a753\nemphasis added; c.f. \u00a756). She anticipates that these probable\nreasons aim at truth about the causal structure of the world and not\njust at an accurate description and prediction of phenomena. This is\ninteresting because this situates Du Ch\u00e2telet squarely within one\nparticular tradition with respect to hypotheses. Historically, there\nhave been two key directions in which thinking about hypotheses\ndeveloped, indeed from Ancient times, and certainly throughout the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries as well. According to one \napproach\u2014typified by Ptolemy in pre-modern thought and sometimes\nassociated with \u201csave the phenomena\u201d type \nexplanations\u2014hypotheses are posited merely because they are useful\ninstruments, mere mathematical calculating devices especially useful\nfor prediction and scientific practice. The aim with hypotheses,\naccording to this approach, is not to propose a true account\nof the nature of things since reaching true conclusions about the world\nis not necessarily relevant when formulating hypotheses according to\nthis tradition which focuses more pointedly on prediction. According to\nthe second approach\u2014typified by Aristotle in pre-modern thought\nand sometimes associated with causal explanations\u2014hypotheses\nare posited in order to provide an explanation of how experienced\neffects might have come about. The aim is to give a true\naccount of the nature of things, especially the causal nature\nof\n things.[22]\nIn starting off her chapter\non hypotheses with a mention of \u201cthe true causes of natural\neffects\u201d, Du Ch\u00e2telet indicates her commitment to the\nAristotelian tradition vis \u00e0 viz hypotheses, a point\nwhich becomes abundantly clear as her chapter on hypotheses\nproceeds.\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet thinks hypotheses are useful (in addition to their\nproviding a necessary step in scientific method) because \u201cwhen a\nhypothesis is once posed, experiments are often done to ascertain if it\nis a good one, experiments which would never have been thought of\nwithout it\u201d (IP \u00a758). They are useful, that is, for\nsuggesting innovative experiments. Such experiments can add\nplausibility to a hypothesis if the results of them indicate that the\nhypothesis captures the truth, but a single experiment which falsifies\na hypothesis is enough to require the scientist to reject it, or at\nleast, to reject whatever part of the hypothesis is deemed faulty, for\na hypothesis \u201ccan be true in one of its parts and false in\nanother\u201d (IP \u00a765). As an example to explain how this might\nbe the case, she cites Descartes\u2019 hypothesis of a vortex of fluid\nmatter being the cause of the gravitational pull of bodies to the\nearth. As an example of her remarkable open-mindedness, she rejects the\nspecifics of Descartes\u2019 hypothesis in light of Huygen\u2019s\ndemonstrations that it does not square with observed facts, while also\nallowing that \u201cit cannot be legitimately concluded that a vortex,\nor several vortices, conceived of in a different way, cannot be the\ncause of these movements\u201d (IP \u00a765). In this case, then,\nfalsifying data requires that we invalidate only part of\nDescartes\u2019 hypothesis.\n\n\nSo Du Ch\u00e2telet takes an extremely friendly view of the role of\nhypothesis in scientific reasoning. Still, wary of those who make bad\nuse of hypotheses, Du Ch\u00e2telet puts strict limits on their use. A\nhypothesis must \u201cnot only [explain] the phenomenon that one had\nproposed to explain with it, but also that all the consequences drawn\nfrom it agree with the observations\u201d (IP \u00a758). Herein, we\nhave the idea that a good hypothesis will explain a plethora of effects\nincluding many not originally under investigation. Du Ch\u00e2telet\nbelieves that the more such effects that can be explained (as well as the more\nexperiments performed which turn out as predicted by the hypothesis),\nthe more probable the hypothesis is. Indeed, Du Ch\u00e2telet makes\nthe very strong claim that \u201chypotheses finally become truths when\ntheir probability increases to such a point that one can morally\npresent them as certain\u201d (IP \u00a767), though the\npsychological context of the passage (\u201cas a very great\ndegree of probability gains our assent, and has on us almost the same\neffect as certainty\u201d) indicates that a highly probable hypothesis\nis merely highly probable and not strictly true, and \nthat Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s considered position\nis \u201cthat hypotheses become the poison of philosophy when they are\nmade to pass for the truth\u201d (IP, Avant-Propos\n VIII)[23].\nAccording to Du Ch\u00e2telet, part of the scientist\u2019s job is to\n\u201chave certain knowledge of the facts that are within our reach,\nand to know all the circumstances attendant upon the phenomena we want\nto explain\u2026 for he who would hazard a hypothesis without this\nprecaution would run the risk of seeing his explanation overthrown by\nnew facts that he had neglected to find out about\u201d (IP \u00a761).\nSo the scientist must become acquainted with many empirical facts so as\nto ensure that she is not ignorant of potentially falsifying data (IP\n\u00a764).\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s belief that hypotheses gain strength the\nmore phenomena they explain indicates a commitment to the idea of\nsimplicity and systematicity of causes, and the orderly\ninterconnectedness of cause and effects in the created world. These\nfeatures, to recall the discussion above of her PSR, are explicitly\nassociated with the PSR, and that principle\u2019s\nmetaphysical\n dimension.[24]\nFor not only is the PSR a\nprinciple which guides our own search for knowledge, it is a principle\nwhich guided God in his choices when creating the world (IP \u00a723)\nwhich, as the best possible world, is \u201cthe one where the greatest\nvariety exists with the greatest order, and where the largest number of\neffects is produced by the simplest laws\u201d (IP \u00a728). So the\nability of hypotheses to explain a plethora of phenomena is a direct\nresult for Du Ch\u00e2telet of the real systematicity of the\nworld\u2019s causal structure\n itself.[25]\nThis point drives home the\nsuggestion made above that Du Ch\u00e2telet is squarely in the\nAristotelian tradition with respect to hypotheses; hypotheses are meant\nto capture the true causal structure of our systematically\ninterconnected world, and are not only calculating or predictive\ndevices by which the scientist merely gives an accurate description of\nthe phenomena. At the same time, and we shall see this in the next section,\nthe fairly significant degree of separation between metaphysics and \nphysics mentioned at the close of the previous section will put \nstrict limits on how much the scientist can appeal to systematic\ninterconnectedness in \n physics.[26]\n\n\nTo conclude, let me turn to Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s definition of\na useful hypothesis:\n\n\nSo hypotheses are only probable propositions, which have a greater\nor lesser degree of probability according to whether they satisfy a\nlarger or fewer number of the circumstances that accompany the\nphenomena that we want to explain by means of the hypotheses. And since\na very high degree of probability encourages our agreement so as to\nhave nearly the effect upon us as certainty, hypotheses eventually\nbecome truths for us if their probability increases to such a point\nthat this probability can morally pass for certainty\u2026. In\ncontrast, an hypothesis becomes improbable in proportion to the number\nof circumstances found for which the hypothesis does not give a reason.\nAnd finally, it becomes false when it is found to contradict a\nwell-established observation. (IP \u00a767)\n\n\nAt the start of this section, we mentioned that Du Ch\u00e2telet is at\nthe forefront of the emergence of the embrace of the\nhypothetico-deductive in scientific explorations. Some have attributed\nsuch a method to Descartes (e.g. Lauden 1981) while others have\ndisputed this, due to his refusal to devise testing experiments and to\ntake falsifying data seriously (McMullin 1990, 44; McMullin 2008, 98;\nand Sakellariadis 1982, passim). On both points, Du\nCh\u00e2telet departs notably from Descartes due to her very\nfriendliness to this sort of engagement with the empirical.\nNonetheless, as also mentioned above, she is somewhat out of step with\nher own time precisely because of her unabashed endorsement of the\nneed for hypotheses. Moreover, her endorsement of the Aristotelian\nidea of hypotheses, and her belief in the systematic unity of the\nnatural world, shows that she also embraces there being a relation\nbetween metaphysics and physics, even while she also believes that\nthere are limits to what we can know about that relation. This is no\nsurprise given our characterization of her above as a natural\nphilosopher, a pre-modern stance despite her standing on the cusp of\nmodern conceptions of hypotheses and scientific methodology. She is\ntruly standing between two worlds, the old world of natural philosophy\nand the soon to emerge new world of modern science as we now know\nit.\n",
