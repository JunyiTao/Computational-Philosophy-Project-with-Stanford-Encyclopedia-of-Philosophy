    "main_text": "The Role of Aristotelian Essentialism\n5. The Role of Aristotelian Essentialism\n\nAristotelian essentialism is the view that there exist what modern\nphilosophers would treat as natural kinds, for example, human beings,\nhorses and acanthus plants. Individuals belonging to these kinds have\nessential natures that are definable. These individuals cannot survive\na change in essence, but they can survive a change in their accidental\nproperties. There is a difference between dying and dyeing one\u2019s\nhair. When a human being ceases to be a human being, she dies. By\ncontrast, when her hair is dyed a different color, she survives. In an\nearlier work, Aristotle distinguishes essence, for example the\nnecessary property of being rational for a human being, from accident,\nfor example, being asleep, and from distinctive properties, those\nnecessary properties that are explained by rationality but are not\npart of the human essence, for example, the capacity to learn a\nlanguage (Topics I 5). It is a puzzling feature of the\nargument of Metaphysics IV 4 that distinctive properties are\nnot explicitly mentioned.\n\nAristotle says that those who refuse to take up the challenge to\nsignify one thing \u201cdo away with substance and essence. For they\nmust say that all attributes are accidents, and that there is no such\nthing as \u2018being essentially a human being\u2019 or \u2018an\nanimal\u2019\u201d (Metaph IV 4 1007a20\u201323).\nAccording to Aristotle, then, those who claim to reject PNC are\nrejecting Aristotelian essentialism. Aristotle connects \u201cmerely\nsignifying about\u201d with denoting an accident, and\n\u201csignifying\u201d with denoting the bearer of an accident, the\nbearer being a substance. If the opponent refuses to\n\u201csignify\u201d, she is left with accidents.\n\nNext, Aristotle tries to put Humpty Dumpty together again: Accidents\ncannot be predicated of accidents, but they must be predicated of\nsomething. For example, if there are accidents such as the musical or\nthe pale, these cannot be predicated of one another, so they need a\nsubject with an essential nature to be predicated of, for example,\nSocrates, a human being. While Socrates is pale and musical, the pale\nis not musical, nor the musical pale, unless all this means is that\nSocrates is pale and musical. Nor does a collection of\naccidents\u2014the pale, the musical and so on\u2014add up to one\nsubject like Socrates. Nor does it tell us what Socrates is, a human\nbeing. Accidents need subjects and subjects that are substances and\nhave an essential nature, and, if that is the case, essentialism is\nreinstated and PNC applies after all.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, if the opponent refuses to speak, he is no\nbetter off than a vegetable. While this may seem to be merely\nill-tempered abuse, it has a serious side. If the opponent rejects PNC\nand essentialism, then he cannot explain why he is not a\nvegetable. Aristotelian essentialism, if correct, applies to oneself\nas well as to other things in the world. At first sight, it is not\nclear why the PNC-opponent is left with a picture of anything. But\nperhaps that is Aristotle\u2019s point. Aristotle gives the\nPNC-opponent a world in which accidents can be linked up in any way he\nlikes. Anything goes in such a world, or nothing goes, depending on\nhis taste. Alternatively, as Aristotle puts it, \u201call things will\nbe one\u201d (Metaph IV 4 1007a19).\n\nAristotle is arguing that the rejection of PNC leads to the rejection\nof Aristotelian essentialism, and the acceptance of Aristotelian\nessentialism leads to the acceptance of PNC. A controversial question\nis whether Aristotle is also arguing that the acceptance of PNC\nnecessarily goes hand in hand with the acceptance of Aristotelian\nessentialism. If Aristotle is claiming that to signify something is to\nsignify a bearer that has an essential nature, this would lead to the\nacceptance of both PNC and some form of essentialism. The argument\nitself does not rule out Platonic forms as the bearers, or momentary\nobjects, or numbers. Nevertheless, the argument could be supplemented\nby Aristotle\u2019s arguments elsewhere against Platonic forms, and\nhis distinctions between different types of change in the world.\n",
