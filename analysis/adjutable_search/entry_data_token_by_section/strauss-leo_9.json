    "main_text": "Controversies Revisited\n10. Controversies Revisited\n\nLet us return to the controversies surrounding Strauss and his work,\nmentioned above. The claim that Strauss is in some way responsible for\nthe Bush administration\u2019s decision to invade Iraq has little\nmerit. As should be clear from the above, Strauss\u2019s work does\nnot concern policy issues of any sort. If others have adapted his\nphilosophical ideas in the pursuit of policy questions, they\nthemselves are responsible for those policy decisions, not Strauss.\nMorever, few, if any, real arguments have been advanced that conclude\nBush administration policy makers who studied with Strauss\u2019s\nstudents ever consciously applied his ideas when making decisions\nconcerning the war in Iraq. In the context of such claims about\nStrauss\u2019s influence on the Bush administration\u2019s policies\non Iraq and the Middle East more generally, there is an irony, namely,\nthat Strauss himself was devoted to revitalizing Islamic philosophy,\nas opposed to Christian thought, for the very sake of the future of\nwestern civilization.\n\nAppreciating the centrality of Strauss\u2019s concern with the\ntheologico-political predicament allows us also to reconsider claims\nabout his purported sympathy for fascism. In recent years, much has\nbeen made of a letter that the young Strauss wrote to his friend Karl\nL\u00f6with in 1933. Writing from Paris and reflecting on\nHitler\u2019s rise to power, Strauss wrote that it was only possible\nto \u201cprotest against the shabby abomination\u201d of Nazi\nGermany \u201cfrom the principles of the right, that is from fascist,\nauthoritarian, and imperial principles\u201d (GS 3, pp.\n624\u2013625). A number of Strauss\u2019s severest critics refer to\nthis letter as evidence of Strauss\u2019s fascism, if not Nazism.\nYet, as Robert Howse has concisely pointed out, \u201cIt requires\nonly a little care, and remembering the context of the letter, to\nunderstand that Strauss is not here affirming as true \u2018the\nprinciples of the right\u2019 but rather he is suggesting that they\nare the only effective basis on which Hitler (\u2019the shabby\nabomination\u2019) could be opposed in the present\ncircumstances\u201d (Howse 2012). Rather than an expression of\nsympathy for the fascist, imperial right of Hitler\u2019s Germany,\nStrauss\u2019s letter to L\u00f6with is further evidence of his life\nlong moral worry about liberal democracy\u2019s ability to offer a\ncoherent account of its own normative commitments.  It may even\nreflect Strauss\u2019s fundamental commitment to peace (Howse, 2014).\n\nThe variety of claims about Strauss\u2019s view of esotericism,\nmentioned above, is also fundamentally problematic. First, we have\nseen that a crucial, if usually overlooked, presupposition of\nStrauss\u2019s view of esotericism is his concern with\nwritten texts. From the perspective of his own claims about\nesotericism, what may or may not have been Strauss\u2019s own views\nare irrelevant to interpreting his work.\n\nSecond, there is no reason to conclude, as many do, that Strauss\nhimself wrote esoterically. For instance, Laurence Lampert\u2019s\nview that \u201cIt is reasonable to suspect that a partisan of\nesoteric philosophy [i.e. Strauss] would himself write\nesoterically\u201d (Lampert 2009, p. 63) simply does not follow from\nStrauss\u2019s own claims. In Strauss\u2019s words, \u201cThe only\npresentations of an author\u2019s views which can be accepted as true\nare those ultimately borne out by his own explicit statements\u201d\n(PAW, pp. 26\u201327). While Maimonides announces in the introduction\nto the Guide that he will write esoterically, Strauss makes\nno such statement. So too, in Strauss\u2019s words, \u201cthe\nproblem inherent in the surface of things, and only in the surface of\nthings, is the heart of things\u201d (TM, p. 13). Strauss tells us\nthat the theologico-political predicament is his focal issue. Why\nshould we, on the basis of Strauss\u2019s own terms, think\notherwise?\n\nThird, suggestions that Strauss reads a multitude of authors\nesoterically simply do not hold up. Strauss only uses the term\n\u201cesotericism\u201d in Persecution and the Art of\nWriting and hence only in connection with Halevi, Spinoza, and\nMaimonides.\n\nAnd fourth, Strauss never claims to have discovered any secret in\nMaimonides or anyone else, but rather an understanding of the\nnecessity and limits of philosophy as it relates to revelation and\npolitics.  Indeed, as Strauss put it to Guttmann in 1949, \u201cthe\nproblem in principle of esotericism\u201d is \u201cthe relationship between\nthought and society\u201d (as quoted in Meier, 24n32).  \n\nAll of these issues aside, the most persistent and serious\nmisunderstanding of Strauss is that he promotes mass deception. On\nthis reading, Strauss suggests that the masses simply cannot handle\nthe truth and are in need of a class of political elites who, while\nthemselves pursuing the truth, support the noble lies necessary for\nany society to function. If this was Strauss\u2019s view then, as\nMoshe Halbertal has recently and rightly noted, Strauss or \u201cthe\nStraussians are\u2026na\u00efve in believing that genuine elites can\nbe trusted. Trusting the existence of a selected group of wise men who\nare devoted to the collective good, and who are freed from ambition\nand self-interest because of their pursuit of truth, is as crude as\nthe belief in a society where masses disappear and deliberation and\nreason control human\u2019s political choices\u201d (CR, p. 163).\nHalbertal calls Strauss\u2019s conception of esotericism\n\u201cinstrumental\u201d because it \u201cfocuses on the harmful\nresults of the dissemination\u201d [of the truth] (CR, p. 149).\n\nYet if we understand Strauss\u2019s rather minimal claims about\nesotericism as an antidote to what he called the theologico-political\npredicament of modernity, then this reading of Strauss (regardless of\nwhat various Straussians claim) is not quite right. As we have seen,\nStrauss develops his conception of esotericism in an attempt to\nrethink the relation between theory and praxis. Esotericism is not\nmerely a political, or instrumental, tool for Strauss but also\nconcerns the very nature of truth. Esotericism points to what Strauss\nregards as the critical problem of philosophy, which concerns the\nself-sufficiency of reason. Halbertal is right that \u201cHumans,\neven those who devote themselves to truth, are always embedded within\nthe boundaries of the human condition\u201d (CR, p. 163). But this\nshould not be a criticism of Strauss but is better understood as\ndescribing the very impetus for the dialogical structure of\nStrauss\u2019s account of esotericism.\n\nAlthough he does not apply it to Strauss, Halbertal provides a more\nhelpful rubric under which we may better understand Strauss\u2019s\nconception of esotericism. Strauss\u2019s view of esotericism is not\n\u201cinstrumental\u201d but instead \u201cessential,\u201d which\nmeans that, to quote Halbertal, esotericism \u201cis not the result\nof a strategy adopted by philosophy in its relation toward society,\nbut is part of the essence of the philosophical realm\u201d (CR, p.\n57). As Halbertal notes, this position leads to a skeptical position\nthat Shlomo Pines (a professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University\nin Jerusalem from 1952\u20131990 and the translator of\nMaimonides\u2019 Guide of the Perplexed into English for\nwhich Strauss provided the introduction) attributed to Maimonides (in\nan article which, incidentally, he published after Strauss\u2019s\ndeath). While Pines\u2019 concern was specifically with\nMaimonides\u2019 account of language, Strauss saw esotericism as a\nmore generalized form of philosophical skepticism. To return to\nStrauss\u2019s abiding interest in the relation between theory and\npractice, Strauss\u2019s skepticism was also skeptical of itself in\nrecognizing the limits, political, moral, and philosophical, of\nskepticism. This recognition, for Strauss, is the work of a truly\ncritical philosophy.\n",
