    "main_text": "Fundamentals || Common strong belief and forward induction\n4.3 Common strong belief and forward induction\nIn the previous section, we assumed that the players interpret an\nopponent\u2019s deviation from expected play in an extensive game\n(e.g., deviation from the backward induction path) as an indication\nthat that player will choose \u201cirrationally\u201d at future\ndecision nodes. However, this is just one example of a belief revision\npolicy. It is not suggested that this is the belief revision policy\nthat players should adopt. Stalnaker\u2019s central claim is\nthat models of extensive games should include a component that\ndescribes the players\u2019 disposition to change their beliefs\nduring a play of the game, which may vary from model to model or even\namong the players in a single model:\n\nFaced with surprising behavior in the course of a game, the players\nmust decide what then to believe. Their strategies will be based on\nhow their beliefs would be revised, which will in turn be based on\ntheir epistemic priorities\u2014whether an unexpected action should\nbe regarded as an isolated mistake that is thereby epistemically\nindependent of beliefs about subsequent actions, or whether it\nreveals, intentionally or inadvertently, something about the\nplayer\u2019s expectations, and so about the way she is likely to\nbehave in the future. The players must decide, but the theorists\nshould not\u2014at least they should not try to generalize about\nepistemic priorities that are meant to apply to any rational agent in\nall situations. (Stalnaker 1998: 54)\n\nOne belief revision policy that has been extensively discussed in\nthe epistemic game theory literature is the rationalizability\nprinciple. Battigalli (1997) describes this belief revision\npolicy as follows:\n\nRationalizability Principle\nA player should always try to interpret her information about the\nbehavior of her opponents assuming that they are not implementing\n\u2018irrational\u2019 strategies.\n\nThis belief revision policy is closely related to\nso-called forward induction reasoning. To illustrate,\nconsider the following imperfect information game:\n\n\nFigure 19\n\nIn the above game, \\(A\\) can either exit the game initially (by\nchoosing \\(e\\)) for a guaranteed payoff of \\(2\\) or decide to play a game\nof imperfect information with \\(B\\). Notice that \\(r_1\\) is strictly\ndominated by \\(e\\): No matter what \\(B\\) chooses at \\(v_3\\), \\(A\\) is better\noff choosing \\(e\\). This means that if \\(A\\) is following a rational\nstrategy, then she will not choose \\(r_1\\) at \\(v_1\\). According to the\nrationalizability principle, \\(B\\) is disposed to believe that \\(A\\) did\nnot choose \\(r_1\\) if he is given a chance to move. Thus, assuming that\n\\(B\\) knows the structure of the game and revises his beliefs according\nto the rationalizability principle, his only rational strategy is to\nchoose \\(l_2\\) at his informational cell (consisting of \\(\\{v_2,\nv_3\\})\\). If \\(A\\) can anticipate this reasoning, then her only rational\nstrategy is to choose \\(e\\) at \\(v_1\\). This is the forward induction\noutcome of the above game.\nBattigalli & Siniscalchi (2002) develop an epistemic analysis\nof forward induction reasoning in extensive games (cf. also, Stalnaker\n1998: sec. 6). They build on an idea of Stalnaker (1998, 1996) to\ncharacterize forward induction solution concepts in terms of\ncommon strong belief in rationality. We discussed the\ndefinition of \u201cstrong belief\u201d in Section\n2.4. The mathematical representation of beliefs in Battigalli\n& Siniscalchi (2002) is different, although the underlying idea is\nthe same. A player strongly believes an event \\(E\\) provided she\nbelieves \\(E\\) is true at the beginning of the game (in the sense that\nshe assigns probability 1 to \\(E\\)) and continues to believe \\(E\\) as long\nas it is not falsified by the evidence. The evidence\navailable to a player in an extensive game consists of the\nobservations of the previous moves that are consistent with the\nstructure of the game tree\u2014i.e., the paths through a game\ntree. A complete discussion of this approach is beyond the scope of\nthe entry. Consult Battigalli & Siniscalchi (2002); Baltag et\nal. (2009); Battigalli & Friedenberg (2012); Bonanno (2013); Perea\n(2012, 2014); and van Benthem & Gheerbrant (2010) for a discussion\nof this approach and alternative epistemic analyses of backward and\nforward induction.\n",
