    "main_text": "Metaphilosophy || Realism and idealism\n2.6 Realism and idealism\n\nCollingwood is often referred to as a British idealist, but his\nallegiance to idealism was in large measure a response to the Oxford\nrealism he had imbibed as a student and continued to profess until\naround 1916. Hence he tended to be rather wary of the label\n\u201cidealist\u201d, and in his correspondence with Gilbert Ryle he\nexplicitly rejected it (EPM\u00a02005: 256). However, in his lectures\non Central Problems of Metaphysics (1935) he tentatively propounded a\nform of what he termed \u201cobjective idealism.\u201d But,\nnonetheless, as in his response to Ryle, he continued to rail against\nthose who sought to pin his position down to an \u201cism\u201d,\nonce remarking that \"I am not going to be pigeon-holed into one of\nyour neat categories. Philosophy is a process of inquiry, not dogmatic\npositions\" (Hector 2000).\n\nThis reluctance is probably due to the fact that idealism is most\noften identified with immaterialism and he would not have wished his\ncriticism of realism to be interpreted as resting on a commitment to\nthe claim that the real is ideal or that mind is causally responsible\nfor the existence of reality. If the contrast between idealism and\nrealism is understood as one between two metaphysical views concerning\nthe ontological constitution of reality (is it mental? Is it\nmaterial?) Collingwood had nothing to contribute to the debate between\nrealists and idealists; he would have regarded it as belonging to\nmetaphysics as the study of pure being, not as metaphysics understood\nas a form of presuppositional analysis. In An Autobiography\n(1939) he contrasted realism not with immaterialism but with the\ncommitment to presuppositionless knowledge or the realist view\npropounded by Cook Wilson and Prichard that \u201cknowing makes no\ndifference to what is known\u201d (AA 2013: 44). Denying realism, so\nunderstood, is to deny that there can be any such thing as knowledge\nof pure being. Since all knowledge takes the form of answers to\nquestions, and all questions rest on presuppositions, knowledge\nnecessarily has presuppositions. Collingwood\u2019s critique of\nrealism therefore takes Kant\u2019s criticism of the possibility of\nknowing things as they are in themselves a step further. Kant did not\ndeny that talk about knowledge of things as they are in themselves is\ncoherent; he simply claimed that this sort of knowledge is unavailable\nto us. Collingwood\u2019s critique of realism, by contrast, denies\nthat there is any such thing as presuppositionless knowledge.\nPresuppositionless knowledge is not a kind of knowledge that it is not\npossible for us to acquire but may be available to another being, such\nas God: the idea of presuppositionless knowledge involves an oxymoron\nbecause all knowing involves presuppositions.\n",
