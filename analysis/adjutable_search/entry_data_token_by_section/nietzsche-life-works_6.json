    "main_text": "Nietzsche\u2019s Unpublished Notebooks\n7. Nietzsche\u2019s Influence Upon 20th Century Thought\n\nNietzsche\u2019s thought extended a deep influence during the 20th\ncentury, especially in Continental Europe. In English-speaking\ncountries, his positive reception has been less resonant. During the\nlast decade of Nietzsche\u2019s life and the first decade of the 20th\ncentury, his thought was particularly attractive to avant-garde\nartists who saw themselves on the periphery of established social\nfashion and practice. Here, Nietzsche\u2019s advocacy of new, healthy\nbeginnings, and of creative artistry in general stood forth. His\ntendency to seek explanations for commonly-accepted values and\noutlooks in the less-elevated realms of sheer animal instinct was also\ncrucial to Sigmund Freud\u2019s development of psychoanalysis. Later,\nduring the 1930s, aspects of Nietzsche\u2019s thought were espoused\nby the Nazis and Italian Fascists, partly due to the encouragement of\nElisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche through her associations with Adolf\nHitler and Benito Mussolini. It was possible for the Nazi interpreters\nto assemble, quite selectively, various passages from\nNietzsche\u2019s writings whose juxtaposition appeared to justify\nwar, aggression and domination for the sake of nationalistic and\nracial self-glorification.\n\nUntil the 1960s in France, Nietzsche appealed mainly to writers and\nartists, since the academic philosophical climate was dominated by\nG.W.F. Hegel\u2019s, Edmund Husserl\u2019s and Martin\nHeidegger\u2019s thought, along with the structuralist movement of\nthe 1950s. Nietzsche became especially influential in French\nphilosophical circles during the 1960s\u20131980s, when his\n\u201cGod is dead\u201d declaration, his perspectivism, and his\nemphasis upon power as the real motivator and explanation for\npeople\u2019s actions revealed new ways to challenge established\nauthority and launch effective social critique. In the\nEnglish-speaking world, Nietzsche\u2019s unfortunate association with\nthe Nazis kept him from serious philosophical consideration until the\n1950s and 60s, when landmark works such as Walter Kaufmann\u2019s,\nNietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist (1950) and\nArthur C. Danto\u2019s, Nietzsche as Philosopher (1965),\npaved the way for a more open-minded discussion.\n\nSpecific 20th century figures who were influenced, either quite\nsubstantially, or in a significant part, by Nietzsche include\npainters, dancers, musicians, playwrights, poets, novelists,\npsychologists, sociologists, literary theorists, historians, and\nphilosophers: Alfred Adler, Georges Bataille, Martin Buber, Albert\nCamus, E.M. Cioran, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Isadora Duncan,\nMichel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, Stefan George, Andr\u00e9 Gide,\nHermann Hesse, Carl Jung, Martin Heidegger, Gustav Mahler,\nAndr\u00e9 Malraux, Thomas Mann, H.L. Mencken, Rainer Maria Rilke,\nJean-Paul Sartre, Max Scheler, Giovanni Segantini, George Bernard\nShaw, Lev Shestov, Georg Simmel, Oswald Spengler, Richard Strauss,\nPaul Tillich, Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies, Mary Wigman, William Butler\nYeats and Stefan Zweig.\n\nThat Nietzsche was able to write so prolifically and profoundly for\nyears, while remaining in a condition of ill-health and often intense\nphysical pain, is a testament to his spectacular mental capacities and\nwill power. Lesser people under the same physical pressures might not\nhave had the inclination to pick up a pen, let alone think and record\nthoughts which\u2014created in the midst of striving for healthy\nself-overcoming\u2014would have the power to influence an entire\ncentury.\n",
