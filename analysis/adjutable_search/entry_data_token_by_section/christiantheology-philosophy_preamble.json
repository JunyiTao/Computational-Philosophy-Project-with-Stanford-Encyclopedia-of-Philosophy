    "main_text": "\n\nMany Christian doctrines raise difficult philosophical questions. For\nexample, Christians have traditionally insisted that they worship a\nsingle God, while simultaneously identifying that God with a trinity\ncomprised of three numerically distinct, fully divine persons: the\nFather, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is not easy to see how three\ndivine persons add up to one God. Similarly, Christians have also\nasserted that a human man, Jesus of Nazareth, is also God-the-Son, the\nsecond person of the divine trinity. It is not easy to see how a human\nman, who is born, lives, and dies, could also be a fully divine being.\nConsider also the relationship between divine providence and human\nfreedom. Are human beings free to accept or reject God, or does God\nalone decide who will accept or reject God? Any answer to this\ntheological question will also assume some specific philosophical\naccount of human freedom and moral responsibility.\n\nChristian thinkers have always drawn on philosophy to help answer\nthese kinds of questions. In the earliest years of Christianity,\nrunning roughly from the second to the seventh centuries CE, and often\ncalled the \u201cPatristic\u201d period, the emerging Christian\nChurch faced the daunting task of defining doctrinal orthodoxy in the\nface of internal and external challenges. In pursuing this task,\nPatristic thinkers typically did not understand themselves as\n\u201ctheologians\u201d in contrast to \u201cphilosophers\u201d.\nIndeed, they may not have endorsed any sharp distinction between\nphilosophy and theology at all. But they still reasoned about their\nChristian commitments in the intellectual idiom of the ancient\nMediterranean world, which was the idiom of Platonic, Aristotelian,\nand Stoic philosophy.\n\nOver the course of the Patristic period, as the early Church\nsuccessfully established its own intellectual framework, it formally\ndefined the boundaries of Christian orthodoxy through a series of\necumenical councils. These councils\u2014including the Councils of\nNicaea (325 CE), Constantinople (381), and Chalcedon\n(451)\u2014established the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity and its\ncorollary, the doctrine of the Incarnation (see Kelly 1978).\n\nYet even after the parameters of orthodoxy were established, Christian\nthinkers continued to face difficult philosophical questions about the\nmeaning, coherence, and plausibility of settled Christian doctrines.\nThey continued to try to answer those questions using the best\nphilosophy of their day\u2014from Scholastic Aristotelianism in the\nMedieval period to analytic metaphysics today. For Christian\nthinkers, the already settled doctrines of Christian orthodoxy provide\na normative framework within which this philosophical reflection\noccurs, by demarcating the logical space that constrains the field of\nacceptable solutions. For example, it is not open to an orthodox\nChristian thinker to dispel the logical problem of the Trinity (the\nproblem of how God can be both three and one) by arguing that there is\nin fact no God, or that God is not triune, or that the Father and the\nSon are two stages in the temporal life of the one God. These\ntheoretical options are ruled out by virtue of the philosopher\u2019s\nown orthodox Christian commitments.\n\nAs a general, formal matter, this point holds even though different\nChristian groups disagree about what the constraints of orthodoxy\nactually are. So Roman Catholic Christians and Protestant Christians\nwill accept different constraints about, say, the nature of the\nEucharist, and rival Protestant Christian groups will differ with each\nother in a similar way. But as a formal matter, Christian thinkers who\nthink philosophically about Christian doctrines typically do so inside\nthe intellectual framework provided by what they regard as\nauthoritative Christian orthodoxy. Obviously, it is not the case that\neveryone who wants to think philosophically about Christianity must\naccept the constraints of Christian orthodoxy, even in this more\nrelativistic sense of \u201corthodoxy\u201d. Some modern and\ncontemporary thinkers still identify as Christians even though they\nreject the very idea of normative orthodoxy, for example. And, of\ncourse, non-Christian thinkers, including non-theists, will reject any\nnotion of Christian orthodoxy in its entirety. Yet they can still\nthink philosophically about Christian doctrines.\n\nBecause its twin foci are so broad, an encyclopedia entry on\n\u201cPhilosophy and Christian Theology\u201d could legitimately go\nin many different directions. This entry has two related aims. First,\nthe entry discusses methodological questions about how philosophy and\ntheology should be related. Accordingly, it surveys some of the most\nimportant ways they have been related in the history of the Christian\ntradition\n (Section 1),\n before turning to contemporary debates about the way Anglo-American\nanalytic philosophy of religion interacts with theology\n (Section 3).\n Second, in between these two methodological sections, the entry also\ndiscusses recent work in analytic philosophical theology\n (Section 2).\n Note that the previous version of this entry (Murray and Rea 2008\n[2021]) focused on topics in contemporary philosophical theology. That\nversion is archived and available via the\n Other Internet Resources\n but see, also, the topic-focused entries linked in the\n Related Entries\n for additional coverage.\n\nPhilosophical critics of contemporary analytic philosophy of religion\n(APR) are often struck by just how Christian and theological much of\nit seems. This criticism expresses the worry that APR as such looks\ntoo much like Christian philosophical theology. At the same time,\ntheological critics often fault APR for lacking theological\nsophistication\n (Section 3).\n In order to understand both poles of criticism, it is useful to have\na better sense of the relevant historical background\n (Section 1).\n But it is also important to appreciate what the best contemporary\nwork in analytic philosophical theology actually looks like\n (Section 2).\n",
