    "main_text": "Republic, Books II, III, X || Concluding Observations about the Republic\u2019s \u201cquarrel\u201d\n3.4 Concluding Observations about the Republic\u2019s \u201cquarrel\u201d\n\nThe argument in book X cuts across all forms of \u201cpoetry,\u201d\nwhether tragic, comic, lyric, in meter or not; indeed, the earlier\ndistinction between imitative and narrative poetry too seems\nirrelevant here. The conclusion is the same: \u201cWe are, at all\nevents, aware that such poetry mustn\u2019t be taken seriously as a serious\nthing laying hold of truth, but that the man who hears it must be\ncareful, fearing for the regime in himself, and must hold what we have\nsaid about poetry\u201d (608a6\u2013b2). So sweeping a conclusion makes\nmany assumptions, of course, one of which is that there is such as\nthing as \u201ctruth\u201d out there, and the theory of Forms or\nIdeas is part of the metaphysical foundation of that view. The poets\nhave been characterized as making claims to truth, to telling it like\nit is, that are in fact\u2014contrary to appearances\u2014little\nmore than the poet\u2019s unargued imaginative projections whose tenability\nis established by their ability to command the applause of the\naudience. That is, the poets are rhetoricians who are, as it were,\nselling their products to as large a market as possible, in the hope\nof gaining repute and influence.\n\nThe tripartite schema of Idea, artifact, and imitator is as much about\nmaking as it is about imitation. Making is a continual thread\nthrough all three levels of the schema. The Ideas too are said to be\nmade, even though that is entirely inconsistent with the\ndoctrine of Ideas as eternal expressed earlier in the\nRepublic itself (and in all the other Platonic dialogues).\nThe suggestion is arguably that the poets are makers (see also\n599a2\u20133, where we are told that poets \u201cproduce\nappearances,\u201d as one might translate), that they move in a world\npermeated by making. The word \u201cpoetry\u201d in Platonic Greek\ncomes from the word \u201cto make\u201d (poiein), a fact\nupon which Socrates remarks in the\n Symposium.[21]\n Making takes place in and contributes to the world of becoming.\nPhilosophers, by contrast, are presented as committed to the pursuit\nof truth that is already \u201cout there,\u201d independently of the\nmind and the world of becoming. Their effort has to do with discovery\nrather than making. Thus stated the contrast is crude, since poets\nalso reflect what they take their audience to (want to) feel or\nbelieve\u2014they \u201cimitate\u201d in the sense of represent as\nwell as express\u2014and philosophers make speeches and (as Socrates\nhimself says) they too\n imitate.[22]\n Nonetheless, the distinction suggests an interesting possibility,\nviz. that the quarrel between poetry and philosophy is finally, in\nPlato\u2019s eyes, about the relative priority of making and discovery. The\nmaking/discovery distinction chimes with a number of the dichotomies\nupon which we have touched: imagination vs. reason, emotion vs.\nprinciple, becoming vs. being, artifacts vs. Forms, images vs.\noriginals.\n\nNowhere in the Republic does Socrates mention the poet\u2019s\nclaim to inspiration. Indeed, that claim is pointedly omitted in the\npassage in which Socrates talks about the beginnings of the\nIliad (392e2\u2013393a5; see Bloom\u2019s note ad loc).\nSocrates implicitly denies the soundness of that claim here. Given his\nconception of the divine as Idea, such a claim could not be true,\nsince the Ideas do not speak, let alone speak the things which Homer,\nHesiod, and their followers recount. The result is that the poets are\nfabricators even of the appearance of knowing what they are talking\nabout; this is not inconsistent with the Ion\u2019s\ncharacterization of poetry as inspired ignorance.\n\nDoes the critique of poetry in the Republic extend beyond the\nproject of founding the just city in speech? I have already suggested\nan affirmative answer when discussing book II. The concerns about\npoetry expressed in books III and X would also extend beyond the\nimmediate project of the dialogue, if they carry any water at all,\neven though the targets Plato names are of course taken from his own\ntimes. It has been argued that the authority to speak truth that poets\nclaim is shared by many widely esteemed poets since\n then.[23]\n It has also been argued that the debate about the effects on the\naudience of poetry continues, except that today it is not so much\npoets strictly speaking, but the makers of others sorts of images in\nthe \u201cmass media,\u201d who are the culprits. Controversies\nabout, say, the effects of graphic depictions of violence, of the\ndegradation of women, and of sex, echo the Platonic worries about the\nethical and social effects of art. At least in cases such as these, we\nretain Plato\u2019s skepticism about the notion of \u201caesthetic\n distance.\u201d[24]\n",
