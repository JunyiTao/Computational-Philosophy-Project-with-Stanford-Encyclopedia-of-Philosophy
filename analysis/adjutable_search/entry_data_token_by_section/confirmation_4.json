    "main_text": "Hypothetico-deductivism || HD vs. Hempelian confirmation\n2.1 HD vs. Hempelian confirmation\n\nHD-confirmation and Hempelian confirmation convey different intuitions\n(see Huber 2008a for an original analysis). They are, in fact,\ndistinct and strictly incompatible notions. This will be effectively\nillustrated by the consideration of the following conditions.\n\nEntailment condition (EC)\n\nFor any \\(h,e,k \\in \\bL\\), if \\(e\\wedge k\\) is consistent, \\(e\\wedge k\n\\vDash h\\) and \\(k \\not\\vDash h\\), then \\(e\\) confirms \\(h\\) relative\nto \\(k\\).\n\nConfirmation complementarity (CC)\n\nFor any \\(h, e, k \\in \\bL\\), \\(e\\) confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) if\nand only if \\(e\\) disconfirms \\(\\neg h\\) relative to \\(k\\).\n\nSpecial consequence condition (SCC)\n\nFor any \\(h, e, k \\in \\bL\\), if \\(e\\) confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\)\nand \\(h\\wedge k \\vDash h^*\\), then \\(e\\) confirms \\(h^*\\) relative to\n\\(k\\).\n\nOn the implicit proviso that \\(k\\) is empty (that is, tautologous: \\(k\n= \\top\\)), Hempel (1943, 1945) himself had put forward (EC) and (SCC)\nas compelling adequacy conditions for any theory of confirmation, and\ndevised his own proposal accordingly. As for (CC), he took it as a\nplain definitional truth (1943, 127). Moreover, Hempelian confirmation\n(extended) satisfies all conditions above (of course, for arguments\n\\(h\\), \\(e\\) and \\(k\\) for which it is defined). HD-confirmation, on\nthe contrary, violates all of them. Let us briefly discuss each one in\nturn.\n\nIt is rather common for a theory of ampliative (non-deductive)\nreasoning to retain classical logical entailment as a special case (a\nfeature sometimes called \u201csuper-classicality\u201d; see\nStrasser and Antonelli 2019). That\u2019s essentially what (EC)\nimplies for confirmation. Now given appropriate \\(e\\), \\(h\\) and\n\\(k\\), if \\(e\\wedge k\\) entails \\(h\\), we readily get that \\(e\\)\nHempel-confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) in two simple steps. First,\ngiven that \\(e\\) and \\(k\\) are both quantifier-free, \\(dev_{e}(e\\wedge\nk) = e\\wedge k\\) according to Hempel\u2019s full definition of\n\\(dev\\) (see Hempel 1943, 131). Then it trivially follows that\n\\(e\\wedge k \\vDash dev_{e}(e\\wedge k)\\), so \\(e\\wedge k\\) is\n(directly) Hempel-confirmed and its logical consequence \\(h\\) is\nlikewise confirmed (indirectly). Logical entailment is thus retained\nas an instance of Hempelian confirmation in a fairly straightforward\nway. HD-confirmation, on the contrary, does not fulfil (EC). Here is\none odd example (see Sprenger 2011a, 234). With \\(k = \\top\\), just let\n\\(e\\) be the observation report that object \\(a\\) is a black swan,\n\\(swan(a) \\wedge black(a)\\), and \\(h\\) be the hypothesis that black\nswans exist, \\(\\exists x(swan(x) \\wedge black(x))\\). Evidence \\(e\\)\nverifies \\(h\\) conclusively, and yet it does not HD-confirm it, simply\nbecause \\(h \\not\\vDash e\\). So the observation of a black swan turns\nout to be HD-neutral for the hypothesis that black swans exist! The\nsame example shows how HD-confirmation violates (CC), too. In fact,\nwhile HD-neutral for \\(h\\), \\(e\\) HD-disconfirms its negation \\(\\neg\nh\\) that no swan is black, \\(\\forall x(swan(x) \\rightarrow \\neg\nblack(x))\\), because the latter is obviously inconsistent with\n(refuted by) \\(e\\).\n\nThe violation of (EC) and (CC) by HD-confirmation is arguably a reason\nfor concern, for those conditions seem highly plausible. The special\nconsequence condition (SCC), on the other hand, deserves separate and\ncareful consideration. As we will see later on, (SCC) is a strong\nconstraint, and far from sacrosanct. For now, let us point out one\nmajor philosophical motivation in its favor. (SCC) has often been\ninvoked as a means to ensure the fulfilment of the following condition\n(see, e.g., Hesse 1975, 88; Horwich 1983, 57):\n\nPredictive inference condition (PIC)\n\nFor any \\(e, k \\in \\bL\\), if \\(e\\) confirms \\(\\forall x(Fx \\rightarrow\nGx)\\) relative to \\(k\\), then \\(e\\) confirms \\(F(a) \\rightarrow G(a)\\)\nrelative to \\(k\\). \n\nIn fact, (PIC) readily follows from (SCC) and so it is satisfied by\nHempel\u2019s theory. It says that, if evidence \\(e\\) confirms\n\u201call \\(F\\)s are \\(G\\)s\u201d, then it also confirms that a\nfurther object will be \\(G\\), if it is \\(F\\). Notably, this does not\nhold for HD-confirmation. Here is why. Given \\(k = Fa\\) (i.e., the\nassumption that \\(a\\) comes from the \\(F\\) population), we have that\n\\(e = Ga\\) HD-confirms \\(h = \\forall x(Fx \\rightarrow Gx)\\), because\nthe latter entails the former (given \\(k\\)). (That\u2019s the HD\nreconstruction of Nicod\u2019s insight, see below.) We also have, of\ncourse, that \\(h\\) entails \\(h^* = Fb \\rightarrow Gb\\). And yet,\ncontrary to (PIC), since \\(h^*\\) does not entail \\(e\\) (given \\(k\\)),\nit is not HD-confirmed by it either. The troubling conclusion is that\nthe observation that a swan is white (or that a million of them are,\nfor that matters) does not HD-confirm the prediction that a further\nswan will be found to be white.\n",
