    "main_text": "Denying the assumption of structured-propositionalism\n7. Denying the assumption of structured-propositionalism\n\nAll of the accounts considered above \u2013 both Frege\u2019s\naccount, the neo-Fregean accounts, and the various versions of\nneo-Russellianism, from Naive Russellianism to Crimmins and\nPerry\u2019s view and Richard\u2019s view \u2013 share a common\nassumption of structured-propositionalism, according to which\nthe objects of thought are propositions, which are public,\nlanguage-independent, abstract entities with a structure that mirrors,\nto some degree, the syntactic structure of the natural language\nsentences that express them. This assumption is very widely, although\nnot universally, made by contemporary philosophers of language and\nmind. But many have found propositionalism problematic. There are a\nhost of problems that have been raised, some ontological, some purely\nsemantic. For example, some have found propositions to be unduly\nmysterious objects, having no place in a naturalistic world. Sometimes\nthis is part of a general rejection of abstract entities and other\ntimes a rejection of intensional entities in particular. Others have\nfound propositions to lack acceptable individuation conditions. And\nothers have been moved by the so-called unity problem that\nultimately led Russell to abandon propositions as the contents of the\nattitudes in favor of his multiple judgment theory. Finally, some have\nthought that the propositionalist assumption stands in the way of an\nacceptable solution to Frege\u2019s puzzle.\n\nIn this section we survey accounts that deny\nstructured-propositionalism. There are two broad categories of such\ntheories: The first denies propositionalism, according to which\npropositions are the objects of the attitudes. The most natural,\nalthough not the only, way to deny propositionalism is to embrace some\nform of sententialism, according to which belief attributions\nrelate a person to some kind of linguistic entity. The second accepts\na commitment to the propositionalist\u2019s claim that the objects of\nthought are public, language-independent, abstract entities, but\ndenies that these entities are structured. The most natural, although,\nagain, not the only, way to deny structure is to identify\nsets of possible worlds, or functions from worlds to truth values,\nwith the objects of thought. We shall consider sententialism and the\ndenial of structure in turn.\n\nFirst sententialism. The simplest form of sententialism, roughly\ninspired by Rudolph Carnap\u2019s analysis of belief sentences,\nclaims that what we have been calling \u201cpropositional\nattitudes\u201d are really attitudes towards sentences. (See, for\nexample, Carnap 1947 [1958]. Quine too was a proponent of this view.\nSee, for example, his 1956.) On this view, (1) is analyzed as\n(15),\n\n(15) Lois believes-true \u2018Superman is strong\u2019\n\n\nwhere \u2018believes-true\u2019 expresses a primitive relation\nbetween an agent and a sentence. (Similar relations will have to be\nintroduced to correspond to \u2018hopes-true\u2019,\n\u2018desires-true\u2019, etc..)\n\nThis proposal obviously won\u2019t do. As Church famously pointed out\n(see Church 1943, p. 45), construing propositional attitude verbs as\nrelating agents to sentences seems to require that the agent in\nquestion understands the language used in the report. Suppose that\nLois is a monolingual German speaker, but that everything else about\nthe Superman stories is the same. Then we\u2019d still be inclined to\ncount (1) as true. But (15), which is proposed to analyze (1), is\nobviously false, as Lois bears no relation whatsoever to the English\nsentence \u2018Superman is strong\u2019.\n\nProponents of sententialism are well aware of the problem. But it is\nmuch less obvious that they have succeeded in solving it. Carnap (see\nCarnap 1947 [1958], supplement C) responds to Church\u2019s objection\nby claiming that the proposal need not require that the agent\nbelieve-true the very sentence contained in the complement clause, but\nonly some sentence or other that bears some relation (Carnap calls it\n\u2018B\u2019) to the sentence the ascriber uses. But this\nrelation can\u2019t simply be left unanalyzed. And one cannot analyze\nit in terms of believing-true a sentence that expressing the same\nproposition or worse still believing the proposition expressed by the\nembedded sentence, on pains of reverting to the thesis of\npropositionalism that the theory was designed to avoid.\n\nIt seems plausible that some non-language-using animals have\npropositional attitudes or at least that some attitude ascribing\nsentences about non-language-using animals are true. For example, it\nseems that the dog wants to go out when she scratches at the door and\nthat the cat believes food is on its way when she hears the can being\nopened and comes rushing in to eat. But it seems implausible to\nanalyze these cases in terms of these creatures being related to\nsentences, as nonhuman animals almost certainly do not believe true\nsentences.\n\nQuine famously responded to this problem by writing: \u201cWe may\ntreat a mouse\u2019s fear of a cat as his fearing true a certain\nEnglish sentence. This is unnatural without being therefore wrong. It\nis a little like describing a prehistoric ocean current as\nclockwise\u201d (1956, p. 186). Although an excellent turn of the\npen, it seems clear that the worry is in no way answered. Ascribing a\nclockwise current to a prehistoric ocean does not require the\nexistence of clocks in prehistoric time, any more than our using\nactual resources to describe a counterfactual circumstance in which,\nsay, there are no words requires that there are words in that\ncounterfactual circumstance. But this is a false comparison to the\ncase of treating a mouse\u2019s fear of a cat as fearing true an\nEnglish sentence when one is certain the mouse doesn\u2019t\nunderstand English. In the case of non-language-using animals we\naren\u2019t using features of context to fix a content that we then\nevaluate at contexts without those features, as we are in the kinds of\ncases Quine draws our attention to. It is still hard to see how a\nmouse can fear- or believe-true any sentences, English or otherwise,\neven though it can fear a cat and believe that it is dangerous.\n\nDonald Davidson 1968 proposed a more complex version of sententialism.\nAlthough his account was first proposed as an account of indirect\ndiscourse (i.e., of sentences like \u2018Bill said that the\nproposition won\u2019t pass\u2019), it has been extended to a\ngeneral theory of propositional attitudes. (Davidson himself hinted at\nsuch in extension in the opening paragraph of his original paper.) We\nbegin with indirect speech reports. Roughly, Davidson claims that a\nsentence like (16) has as its true logical form (17) below.\n\n(16) Galileo said that the earth moves.\n\n\n(17) Galileo said that. The earth moves.\n\n\nDavidson\u2019s idea is that \u2018that\u2019 in (16) functions as\na demonstrative that refers to the utterance of the sentence that\nfollows. So an utterance of (16) is really an utterance of two\nsentences, one with a demonstrative that then refers to the utterance\nthat follows. Galileo need not have uttered the exact sentence\ndemonstratively referred to for an utterance of (16) to be true.\nInstead, he must have uttered a sentence that \u201csamesays\u201d\nthe utterance demonstratively referred to. So the account may seem to\nhold the promise of overcoming Church\u2019s translation argument.\nThis is called the paratactic account of indirect speech\nreports.\n\nExtending the paratactic account of indirect speech reports to\npropositional attitude reports more generally may seem\nstraightforward. (1) is claimed to have the logical form of (18)\nbelow.\n\n(18) Lois believes that. Superman is strong.\n\n\nAn utterance of (1) is then seen to assert of Lois that she has a\nbelief whose content is captured by the ascriber\u2019s utterance of\nthe sentence \u2018Superman is strong\u2019.\n\nThe truth of (1) plus the true identity statement \u2018Superman is\nClark Kent\u2019 is compatible with (4)\u2019s falsity. This is\nbecause (18) plus the true identity statement does not entail (19)\nbelow.\n\n(19) Lois believes that. Clark Kent is strong.\n\n\nThe two occurrences of \u2018that\u2019 in (18) and (19) do not\nrefer to the same utterance and so there is no guarantee that the two\nutterances samesay the same things. So, the account respects the\nintuitive truth-value judgments of (1)-(4).\n\nThe paratactic account, both solely as an account of indirect speech\nreports and as an account of propositional attitude reports more\ngenerally, has been subject to a wide range of criticisms. (For a\nsampling, see Bigelow 1980, Blackburn 1975, Burge 1986, Clapp 2002,\nMcFetridge 1980, Rumfitt 1993, and especially Schiffer 1987b, pp.\n122\u201338. See Lepore and Loewer 1989 for a defense.) First, there\nare languages where the apparent complementizer \u2013\n\u2018that\u2019, in English \u2013 is not homophonic with a\ndemonstrative. How deep this problem is depends on how seriously the\nparatactic account is about taking surface syntactic form as some kind\nof guide. One might claim that \u2018believes\u2019 (and its\nfellows) express a two place relation between an agent and some kind\nof utterance-like entity, where the embedded sentence functions as a\nrepresenter of the utterance-like entity that the agent in question\nbears the relation to. There is no need, at least not without other\nassumptions, that the apparent complementizer itself function as a\ndemonstrative. And even if there is a need for the complementizer\nitself to function as a demonstrative, there is no need for\nit to be a demonstrative.\n\nSecond, and we think far more telling, there are entailment relations\nthat are intuitively valid that the account counts as invalid and for\nprecisely the same reasons that it counts invalid the intuitively\noffending entailments involved in Frege cases. Recall how the account\ninvalidates substitution of co-referring names within the scope of\n\u2018believes\u2019 sketched above. The same kind of reasoning\nwill, it seems, also lead one to think that the following is\ninvalid.\n\n(A) Lois believes that. Superman is strong.\n\n\nSo, (B) Lois believes that. Superman is strong.\n\n\nJust as the two occurrences of \u2018that\u2019 in (15) and (16)\nrefer to different utterances, so too the different occurrences of\n\u2018that\u2019 in (A) and (B) refer to different utterances. But\nsomething has evidently gone wrong if (A) does not entail (B). (This\nargument mirrors Kaplan\u2019s argument the claim that the primary\nbearers of semantic contents are sentences-in-context, as opposed to\nutterances, which are concrete events. See Kaplan 1977.) This problem\ncan be avoided if, following Rumfitt 1993, utterance-types as opposed\nto utterance-tokens are seen to be the referent of\n\u2018that\u2019.\n\nBut there are other entailment relations that are also problematic for\nthe paratactic account and are not avoided by Rumfitt\u2019s move.\n(Similar points are made by Burge 1986 and Schiffer 1987b.)\nIntuitively, (1) entails (20).\n\n(20) There is something that Lois believes.\n\n\nAnd consider the following entailment relations.\n\n(C) Superman said something funny.\n\n(D) Lois believes what Superman said.\n\nSo, (E) Lois believes something funny.\n\n\nand \n\n(1) Lois believes that Superman is strong.\n\n(F) Superman exists.\n\nSo, (G) There is someone such that Lois believes that he is strong.\n\n\nAll of these are invalid if they are analyzed according to the\nparatactic analysis, whereas they are intuitively valid. This is\nstrong evidence against the paratactic analysis, especially as that\naccount is designed to respect our intuitive validity judgments.\n\nLepore and Loewer 1989 respond to these entailment problems. They try\nto deal with all but the last, which concerns the relationship between\nso-called de dicto belief and de re belief (see the\nsupplementary document, The De Re/De Dicto\nDistinction, op. cit.), by showing how the validity of the\nentailment is preserved by the addition of a premise that it is\nplausible to say we simply take for granted in assessing the validity\nof the entailments displayed above. The success of their strategy\ndepends on the plausibility of the original entailment intuitions\nturning on our implicitly assuming the additional premise in\nquestion.\n\nThere is a final problem that faces the paratactic account that we\nshall briefly discuss. (See Schiffer 1987b.) The key idea behind the\nparatactic view is that the utterance of the embedded sentence serves\nas a surrogate for some entity that the report then asserts the\nsubject of the report bears some relation of samesaying to. But this\nis problematic for at least two reasons. First, the proponent of the\nparatactic account owes an account of when two utterances samesay one\nanother. And, as was the case with Carnap\u2019s proposal, this\naccount cannot make appeal to a proposition which both utterances bear\nsome relation to in virtue of which they samesay one another, on pains\nof the view collapsing into a version of a propositionalist view.\nDavidson thought he had such an account by treating a Tarskian theory\nof truth as a theory of meaning. (See his 1967.) Although there is no\nquestion of doing the issue justice here, Davidson\u2019s work\nproposed that the primary aim of a theory of meaning is to explain\nspeaker competence and in particular the knowledge by which speakers\ncan understand a potentially infinite number of sentences. He thought\nthat a Tarskian truth theory did just that. Although there are still\npractitioners of Davidsonian semantics, the view has been the subject\nof criticism. (Foster 1976 is the ultimate source of many of these\ncriticisms. See Soames 1989, 1992 and chapter 12 of his 2003 for a\nfurther critique of the view. For a defense of the strategy, see\nLarson and Segal 1995.)\n\nThis problem is more pressing when one moves from indirect speech\nreports to other propositional attitude reports. For, as Schiffer\n1987b has stressed, whereas (16)\u2019s truth plausibly requires the\nexistence of an utterance on Galileo\u2019s part, it is implausible\nto insist that the truth of (1) requires an actual utterance on\nLois\u2019s part. Lois might truly be said to believe that Superman\nis strong even though she has produced no utterances that samesay the\nascriber\u2019s utterance of \u2018Superman is strong\u2019. So,\nlet \u2018u\u2032\u2019 name the ascriber\u2019s\nutterance of \u2018The earth moves\u2019. If (16) is true, then\nthere exists an utterance u such that Galileo produced\nu and u\u2032 and u samesay one another.\nNow let \u2018u\u2033\u2019 name the attributer\u2019s\nutterance of \u2018Superman is strong\u2019. The truth of (1) does\nnot entail that there exists an utterance u such that Lois\nproduced u and u\u2033 and u samesay one\nanother. So, even if one can give an adequate account of when two\nutterances samesay one another without presupposing a common meaning\nor proposition they are both related to, one\u2019s work in defending\nthe paratactic account as an account of belief sentences (and other\npropositional attitude reporting sentences) is not complete.\n\nThe natural move to make in response is to try to find another token\nstate \u2013 a belief state, for example \u2013 whose existence is\nguaranteed by the truth of a sentence like (1) which can then be\nthought to enter into the samesaying relation to u\u2032.\nThis is what Lepore and Loewer 1989 suggest. But problems remain.\nFirst, even if some beliefs involve an actual episode in the\nbeliever\u2019s mind, say the tokening of some brain state that can\nbe said to samesay u, there are other beliefs, implicit\nbeliefs, for which it is implausible to insist that they are had\nbecause of the actual existence of a token state that is capable of\nentering into the samesaying relation to an utterance. You most likely\ndid not believe 5 minutes ago that there was a pink elephant in your\nroom. The view easily accommodates this fact, as it is not the case\nthat you were in some brain state that samesays my utterance of the\nsentence \u2018There is an elephant in your room\u2019. But,\nprecisely for the same reason, the view seems to not accommodate the\nfact that you also believed that there was not an elephant in your\nroom. (After all, you weren\u2019t merely agnostic on the matter,\nhaving an unsettled mind as to whether or not there is an elephant\nbefore you.) At least prior to your reading these sentences, it seems\nimplausible that you were in some token belief state that samesays an\nutterance of \u2018There is not a pink elephant in your room\u2019.\nSo, implicit beliefs still seem to be a problem for this account.\nSecond, the view seems saddled with the same problem facing\nCarnap\u2019s and Davidson\u2019s views. It is well and fine to say\nthat a propositional attitude report involves an utterance of an\nembedded sentence which samesays something that that the subject of\nthe report bears the appropriate relation to. But the proponent of the\nparatactic account owes an analysis of the samesaying relation that\ndoesn\u2019t presuppose the notion of the two tokens having a common\ncontent, on pains of the view collapsing into a propositionalist view.\nEven if one remains optimistic that a Tarskian truth theory, properly\nconstrained, will serve the purpose as an analysis of the meaning of\nutterances and then sentences, it is far from clear that one should be\nat all hopeful that a similar theory will serve the purpose of\nanalyzing the content of belief, desire, and other attitude states.\nBut then it is hard to see how the view could properly explicate the\nnotion of samesaying without relying on the idea that utterances and\nbelief states express, in some sense, propositions. And simply taking\nsamesaying as a primitive is to merely pretend to have eliminated\npropositions from one\u2019s theory.\n\nThere is an alternative account, in the spirit of the simple\nsentential accounts, first suggested by Gilbert Harman in his 1972. On\nthis view, the contents of the attitudes should be seen to be\ninterpreted logical forms (ILFs). The idea has been worked\nout in more detail by Higginbotham 1991 and especially by Larson and\nLudlow 1993. The idea is that propositional attitude verbs express\nrelations between agents and ILFs, where an ILF is a syntactic tree\nstructured with each of its nodes \u201cinterpreted,\u201d or\nassigned semantic values. Take a simple example. (21) is the ILF\nassociated with (5). (We assume, for simplicity, that the semantic\nvalue of a predicate is the set of individuals that it applies\nto.)\n\n\n(5)\nSuperman is strong. \n\n(21)\n <S, true>\n\n<NP, Superman> <VP, Superman>\n\n<\u2018Superman\u2019, Superman> <\u2018is strong\u2019,\nset of strong things> \n\n\nEven though the semantic values of all the nodes of tree structures\nassociated with (5) and (6) are the same, their ILFs differ given the\ndifferent linguistic items \u2018Superman\u2019 and \u2018Clark\nKent\u2019. The account thus views the contents of propositional\nattitudes as hybrids of linguistic and non-linguistic items; i.e., the\nexpressions of the complement clauses and those expressions\u2019s\nsemantic values. And it promises to account for the intuitive truth of\n(1)-(4) by distinguishing the proposition that Superman is strong from\nthe proposition that Clark Kent is strong in virtue of the difference\nin linguistic items.\n\nClapp 2002 argues that Larson and Ludlow\u2019s account violates\nDavidson\u2019s constraint that the truth condition of a sentence is\na function of the values of its constituent syntactic units and thus,\nClapp argues, the account as a whole fails to provide an account of\nour semantic competence. Soames makes a similar point in his 2002, pp.\n150\u20132, where he argues that Larson and Ludlow\u2019s account\nfails when viewed as a part of the Davidsonian project of accounting\nfor the meanings of sentences, and thus accounting for what speakers\nknow in virtue of which they can understand arbitrary sentences with\nwhich they are competent, in terms of offering a Tarskian truth theory\nfor the language.\n\nThere are problems facing the account that are independent of its\nfitting in with the Davidsonian project. For example, Soames argues\nthat the very mechanisms by which Larson and Ludlow account for the\nconsistency of (1) and (3) \u2013 namely, by distinguishing the\nproposition that Superman is strong from the proposition that Clark\nKent is strong on the grounds that the linguistic item\n\u2018Superman\u2019 is distinct from the linguistic item\n\u2018Clark Kent\u2019 \u2013 proves problematic for other cases in\nwhich we are inclined to think that differences in the linguistic\nitems in the complement clauses cannot lead to a difference in\ntruth-value. One example is an application of Church\u2019s\ntranslation argument. If (1) is true, then a faithful translation of\n(1) into Spanish should preserve truth, leaving the names\nuntranslated.\n\n(22) Lois cree que Superman es fuerte\n\n\nThe ILF associated with \u2018Superman es fuerte\u2019 is different\nfrom the ILF associated with (5), just as the ILF associated with (5)\nis different from the ILF associated with (6). If the core of the\nexplanation of why (1) and (3) are consistent and, more generally, why\nsubstitution fails in the case of co-referring proper names, is that\nthe substitution alters the ILF associated with the complement clause,\nthen it would seem that the above translation, for the very same\nreason, should not be guaranteed to preserve truth. But it intuitively\ndoes. \n\nLarson and Ludlow are aware of this problem, considering it in \u00a77\nof their paper. They suggest two strategies. First they suggest\naltering the account so that the truth of (1) does guarantee the truth\nof (22). This is well and good, but it has to be done in such a way\nthat we don\u2019t lose our explanation of why (1) and (3) are\nconsistent and why (1) doesn\u2019t entail (4). Larson and Ludlow do\nnot tell us how to thread that needle. Second, they consider admitting\nthat (1) does not entail (22) and seeking to explain why (1) and (22)\ncan nonetheless be used to report the same attitude by an auxiliary\naccount. Again, this is well and good, but then they owe us an\nexplanation of why we must go to such pains to explain one set of\nentailment intuitions semantically \u2013 namely, the intuition that\n(1) is consistent with (3) and so does not entail (4) \u2013 while\nbeing so cavalier about relegating other, equally (if not even more)\nrobust entailment intuitions to a non-semantic theory. The\navailability of contextualist theories described above, and in\nparticular Richard\u2019s theory, which at least promises to respect\nboth sets of entailment relations \u2013 that is, respect our\nintuitions of entailment failures, as in the Frege-style cases, as\nwell as our intuitions about entailment successes, as in the relation\nbetween (1) and (22) \u2013 makes this second strategy all the more\nquestionable.\n\nFiengo and May 1996 argue that ILF accounts lack an adequate\nexplanation of Kripke\u2019s Paderewski puzzle. (See\n Section 8\n below.) In brief, Kripke\u2019s puzzle involves pairs of sentences\nthat, like (1) and (3), are intuitively consistent. Unlike (1) and\n(3), however, there do not appear to be different linguistic forms\nemployed in the complement clauses. Instead, extra-linguistic\ncontextual changes are employed in such a way that the same linguistic\nforms seem to indicate different states of the agent. If there is no\ndifference in linguistic items, then the ILFs are the same and so the\nexplanation Larson and Ludlow offer for why (1) and (3) are consistent\ncannot be carried over to Kripke\u2019s case. This is problematic, as\none would like a uniform explanation of the cases. Ludlow 2000 offers\na response, although it seems to us that he moves drastically away\nfrom the key idea of the initial proposal, in which the LFs are public\nlanguage entities.\n\nThe assumption of structured propositionalism has two components: The\nclaim that the objects of the attitudes are propositions and the view\nthat those items are structured. So far we have discussed various ways\nof denying the first. We shall now turn to a discussion of views that\ndeny the second.\n\nHintikka 1969, Stalnaker 1984, and Lewis 1986 are the foremost\nproponents of unstructured-propositionalism. (See the entry on\n structured propositions\n for further details.) Briefly, the idea is that propositions are sets\nof possible worlds. The proposition that Bush is president, for\nexample, just is the set of all possible worlds in which Bush\ninstantiates the property being president. (Or, to remain\nneutral on issues of the metaphysics of transworld identity, all the\nworlds in which Bush or a counterpart of Bush instantiates that\nproperty.)\n\nThere is no denying that a proposition determines a set of possible\nworlds \u2013 namely, the worlds at which the proposition is true.\nAnd for a good many semantic purposes \u2013 in particular, for\ngiving the truth-conditions of sentences containing only extensional\noperators \u2013 treating propositions as sets of worlds suffices.\nBut there are well known problems with this account when it comes to\npropositional attitudes. The most famous problem is the problem of\nequivalence. Intuitively, the proposition that arithmetic is\nincomplete is distinct from the proposition that 2+2=4. Most\n5-year-olds know the latter but can\u2019t even entertain the former.\nAs both propositions are true in exactly the same set of worlds\n\u2013 namely, all, assuming the necessity of mathematical truths\n\u2013 unstructured-propositionalism entails that they are the same\nproposition. Indeed, unstructured propositionalism entails that there\nis exactly one necessary proposition. This is problematic, as it seems\nto entail that anyone believes that 2+2=4 just in case he believes\nthat arithmetic is incomplete.\n\nThe view also seems to have all of the problems that face the\nneo-Russellianism. Because Superman is Clark Kent, and assuming that\nidentity is necessary, the set of worlds in which Superman is strong\nis exactly the set of worlds in which Clark Kent is strong. But then\n(5) and (6) express the same proposition. But, as the Frege case\nshows, there is a strong intuition, and a pair of powerful arguments\nto back it up, that an agent can believe the one without believing the\nother. Proponents of unstructured-propositionalism are well aware of\nthese problems. Stalnaker 1984, 1987, and 1988 contain extremely\ningenious attempts to solve them.\n\nWhereas proponents of possible world semantics see the contents of the\nattitudes being possible worlds, or functions from possible worlds to\ntruth values, proponents of situation semantics, developed by Barwise\nand Perry 1983, see the contents of the attitudes being portions of\npossible worlds, situations. Situations are more fine-grained than\npossible worlds and so avoid some of the problems discussed above.\nBut, as Soames shows in his 1985, the account inherits many of the\nproblems. We shall here discuss just one. Recall that one of the\nproblems facing Naive Russellianism was that\n\n(12) Lois believes that Superman is stronger than Clark Kent.\n\n\nseems to entail\n\n(13) Lois believes that Superman is stronger than Superman.\n\n\nwhich in turn threatens to entail\n\n(14) Lois believes that Superman is stronger than himself.\n\n\nBecause the situation that Superman is stronger than Clark Kent just\nis the situation that Superman is stronger than himself, insofar as\nsituations are the contents of beliefs, these seem to be the same\nbelief. The situation semanticist cannot appeal to the difference\nbetween the property of being taller than Superman and the\nproperty being taller than oneself, claiming that the first\nis a two-place relation and the second a monadic property, as the\nneo-Russellian can, to distinguish the propositions. This is because a\ndifference in structure doesn\u2019t correspond, for the situation\nsemanticist, to a difference in proposition. But then the situation\nsemanticists, as opposed to the Naive Russellian, is committed to the\nclaim that Lois believes that Superman is stronger than himself. But\nsurely that is irrational! (For more discussion of the problem, see\nFine 2007, 2014, Pickel 205, Pickel and Rabern 2017, Pinillos 2011,\nand Salmon 2012, 2015\n\nWe don\u2019t claim to have established the assumption of structured\npropositionalism. But the problems facing the alternatives do seem\ndaunting enough to make that assumption a good bet. \n",
