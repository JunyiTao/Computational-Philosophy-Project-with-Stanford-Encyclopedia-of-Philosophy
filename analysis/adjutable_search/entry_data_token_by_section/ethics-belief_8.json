Some philosophers go further and say that\nknowledge is also the norm of belief - that is, that any\nbelief that does not also count as knowledge is impermissible or\nirrational or vicious or defective. Put another way: knowing that p is\nboth a necessary and a sufficient condition for permissibly\n(rationally, virtuously) believing that p. \n\nOne argument for the claim that knowledge is the norm of belief seeks\nto infer that result from the claim that knowledge is the aim of\nbelief. The aim generates the norm, and any belief that fails to\nachieve the aim also fails to obey the norm. Perhaps the most\nprominent argument along these lines starts with the related claim\nthat knowledge is the \u201cnorm of assertion \u201d\u2014i.e.,\nthat we ought not assert a proposition if we don\u2019t know it (see\nWilliamson 2000). But if that\u2019s the case, and if belief is the\n\u201cinner\u201d analogue of assertion, then it looks as though we\nalso ought only to believe a proposition when the belief counts as\nknowledge. The debate then has to do with whether knowledge really is\nthe norm of assertion, and, if so, whether \u201cbelief\u201d is an\ninner analogue of assertion in such a way that the norm carries over\n(see Sutton 2005, Huemer 2007b, Bach 2008, Goldberg 2009). \n\nOne reason that this position can seem counterintuitive is that an\nimportant role that norms often play is that of guiding action. The\nprinciple that we should only believe what we know is not a very\nhelpful action-guiding norm, since we often don\u2019t know what we\nknow (according to most epistemologists, at least). Of course, if I\nadopt this norm, and know that I don\u2019t know that p,\nthen I\u2019ll see that I shouldn\u2019t believe that p either (this\nnegative formulation is what Williamson uses in 2000, 256). But,\nagain, most epistemologists do not think we are typically able to\ntell, from the inside, whether we would know the proposition in\nquestion if we believed it. And yet that ability seems to be\npresupposed by the idea that this is an action-guiding norm. Another\nobjection to the idea that knowledge is the norm of belief is more\nintuitive: knowledge seems to most of us like a different sort of\naccomplishment than belief, or even justified belief, or (after\nGettier) even justified true belief. It is one thing to say that we\nacquire the concept of belief by looking at paradigm cases of\nknowledge and then subtracting different elements from them (for\ninstance: \u201cjustified belief would be just like knowledge but\nwithout truth\u201d). It is quite another to say that no belief can\ncount as properly formed unless it also counts as knowledge (for more\non all this, see Benton, Other Internet Resources) \n",
