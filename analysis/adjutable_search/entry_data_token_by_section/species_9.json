Let\u2019s start with Barker\u2019s\n(2019a, 2019b) recent work. Barker (2019a) offers several arguments\nagainst species pluralism and he suggests a new form of species\nmonism. \n\nOne assumption that species pluralists make is that there are three\n(perhaps more) types of lineages that biologists call\n\u2018species\u2019. Hence when biologists refer with the word\n\u2018species\u2019 they refer to different types of lineages. As we\nsaw earlier, three types of species lineages are brought to the fore\nby three different species concepts: (1) The Biological Species\nConcept and related concepts highlight those lineages bound by the\nprocess of interbreeding. (2) The Phylogenetic Species Concepts\nhighlight those lineages of organisms that share a common and unique\nancestor. (3) The Ecological Species Concepts highlight lineages of\norganisms that are exposed to common sets of stabilizing selection.\nAccording to species pluralism, the Tree of Life is segmented by\ndifferent processes into different types of species lineages. Barker,\nhowever, questions the pluralist assumption that there are three\ndistinct types of lineages that fall under the heading\n\u2018species\u2019. Barker argues that pluralists have not\nsufficiently established the plausibility of that assumption. For\nexample, he argues that while pluralists assume that interbreeding and\necological species are different types of lineages, many interbreeding\nspecies and ecological species lack explanatorily or predictively\nsignificant differences. So, the pluralist\u2019s assumption that\nthere are distinct types of species lineages is problematic. \n\nBarker also attacks species pluralism from a different angle. In the\npluralist\u2019s argument there is the assumption that the three main\ntypes of species lineages are basal lineages. \u2018Basal\u2019 here\nmeans they are the smallest lineages on the Tree of Life that are\nrecognized by the Linnaean Hierarchy of biological classification.\n(Recall that hierarchy: species are the smallest units of\nclassification followed by more inclusive units such as genus, family,\norder, and so on.) Barker argues that species pluralists unknowingly\nmake an assumption that goes against their attempt to establish\nspecies pluralism. Namely, they assume the three types of species taxa\nthat pluralists refer to (interbreeding species lineages, ecological\nspecies lineages, and phylogenetic species lineages) have an important\nsimilarity \u2013 they are all basal lineages in the Linnaean Hierarchy. If\nthat is the case, then these different types of species lineages have\nsomething in common \u2013 they are all basal lineages. So, species\npluralists are wrong to assert that there are three types of species\nlineages that lack a biologically important commonality.\n\nBarker goes further and suggests what might unify the different\nlineages that fall under different species concepts. Baker argues that\nthe pluralists\u2019 focus on the different forces that cause species\nlineages (interbreeding, ecological, and phylogenetic) is the wrong\nplace to look for unity in the species category. Instead, he suggests\nwe should look for the common effect of species lineages. The common\neffect he focuses on is species cohesiveness. He suggests that species\nlineages are metapopulational feedback systems. Such systems\nhave cohesifying processes that cause further cohesifying processes.\nBarker cites the example of selection for a particular flower color in\na South American plant species. That color is very attractive to\npollinators, thus causing pollinators to more frequently visit that\nspecies\u2019 flowers. That, in turn, causes the genes of the plant\nto be more widely spread to other populations of that species. In this\nexample, selection causes the enhancement of another cohesifying\nforce, gene flow, among the members of a species. As Barker\nrecognizes, his suggestion concerning feedback and cohesiveness in\nspecies is a theoretical hypothesis that needs empirical confirmation.\nNevertheless, it provides a new way that species monists may secure\ntheir position.\n\nAnother recent response to species pluralism is found in the work of\nDoolittle (2019) and Novak and Doolittle (2021). They don\u2019t deny\nthe pluralism in species pluralism, but they deny the\nspecies in species pluralism. That is, they agree with\npluralists that there are different processes that cause the existence\nof basal taxa (what we usually call \u2018species\u2019).\nNevertheless, they think that the general concept of species does\nsignificant work in biology and should not be rejected. The importance\nof the general concept of species, they argue, is to organize the\nstudy of those evolutionary processes that cause basal taxa.\n\nHow does the concept of species help organize the study of evolution,\naccording to Novak and Doolittle? The general concept of species\nconsists of what they call \u201cconceptual patchworks.\u201d Those conceptual\npatchworks are the various species concepts we have seen, such as the\nBiological Species Concept and the Ecological Species Concept. These\npatchwork concepts interact and contribute to our understanding of\nspeciation. For instance, the Biological Species Concept was first\ndeveloped for multicellular organisms, but more recently ideas from\nthat concept have been applied to microorganisms. The result is a\npatchwork version of the Biological Species Concept that applies to\nmulticellular organisms and another version that applies to\nmicroorganisms. (See Section 4 of this entry for more on microbiology\nand species.)\n\nAnother way that Novak and Doolittle see individual species concepts\n(patchworks for them) working together is that they describe the\ndifferent processes that cause the existence of genetic and phenotypic\nclusters of organisms (in other words, basal taxa). For instance, the\nBiological Species Concept focuses on the exchange of genes among the\nmembers of a group, while the Ecological Species Concept focuses on\nthe how selection affects those organisms. According Novak and\nDoolittle, most microorganism clusters are the result of both\nprocesses to varying degrees. These are cases where the Biological\nSpecies Concept and the Ecological Species Concept work together in\nhelping us understand what causes those clusters.\n\nIn the end, Novak and Doolittle accept that there is a plurality of\nspecies concepts that highlight different processes that cause stable\nclusters of organisms. Despite this pluralism, they think the general\nconcept of species and the individual species concepts that fall under\nit form a set of conceptual tools that interact and allow us to\ninvestigate how evolutionary processes give rise to stable clusters of\norganisms. As a consequence, Novak and Doolittle reject the pluralist\nview that the concept of species fails to provide an overarching\nexplanatory approach in biology.\n",
