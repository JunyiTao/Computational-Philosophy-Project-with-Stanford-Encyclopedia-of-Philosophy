    "main_text": "The Goals of Theistic Arguments\n1. The Goals of Theistic Arguments\n\nBefore attempting to explain and assess moral arguments for the\nexistence of God, it would be helpful to have some perspective on the\ngoals of arguments for God\u2019s existence. (We shall generically\nterm arguments for God\u2019s existence \u201ctheistic\narguments.\u201d) Of course views about this are diverse, but most\ncontemporary proponents of such arguments do not see theistic\narguments as attempted \u201cproofs,\u201d in the sense that they\nare supposed to provide valid arguments with premises that no\nreasonable person could deny. Such a standard of achievement would\nclearly be setting the bar for success very high, and proponents of\ntheistic arguments rightly note that philosophical arguments for\ninteresting conclusions in any field outside of formal logic hardly\never reach such a standard. \n\nMore reasonable questions to ask about theistic arguments would seem\nto be the following: Are there valid arguments for the conclusion that\nGod exists that have premises that are known or reasonably believed by\nsome people? Are the premises of such arguments more reasonable than\ntheir denials, at least for some reasonable people? Arguments that\nmeet these standards could have value in making belief in God\nreasonable for some people, or even giving some people knowledge of\nGod\u2019s existence, even if it turns out that some of the premises\nof the arguments can be reasonably denied by other people, and thus\nthat the arguments fail as proofs.\n\nA major issue that cannot be settled here concerns the question of\nwhere the burden of proof lies with respect to theistic arguments.\nMany secular philosophers follow Antony Flew (1976) in holding that\nthere is a \u201cpresumption of atheism.\u201d On this view,\nbelieving in God is like believing in the Loch Ness Monster or\nleprechauns, something that reasonable people do not do without\nsufficient evidence. If such evidence is lacking, the proper stance is\natheism rather than agnosticism.\n\nThis \u201cpresumption of atheism\u201d has been challenged in a\nnumber of ways. Alvin Plantinga (2000) has argued that reasonable\nbelief in God does not have to be based on propositional evidence, but\ncan be \u201cproperly basic.\u201d On this view, reasonable belief\nin God can be the outcome of a basic faculty (called\nthe sensus divinitatis by theologian John Calvin)\nand thus needs no support from arguments at all. In response some\nwould argue that even if theistic belief is not grounded in\npropositional evidence, it still might require non-propositional\nevidence (such as experience), so it is not clear that\nPlantinga\u2019s view by itself removes the burden of proof\nchallenge.\n\nA second way to challenge the presumption of atheism is to question an\nimplicit assumption made by those who defend such a presumption, which\nis that belief in God is epistemologically more risky than unbelief.\nThe assumption might be defended in the following way: One might think\nthat theists and atheists share a belief in many entities: atoms,\nmiddle-sized physical objects, animals, and stars, for example.\nSomeone, however, who believes in leprechauns or sea monsters in\naddition to these commonly accepted objects thereby incurs a burden of\nproof. Such a person believes in \u201cone additional thing\u201d\nand thus seems to incur additional epistemological risk. One might\nthink that belief in God is relevantly like belief in a leprechaun or\nsea monster, and thus that the theist also bears an additional burden\nof proof. Without good evidence in favor of belief in God the safe\noption is to refrain from belief.\n\nHowever, the theist may hold that this account does not accurately\nrepresent the situation. Instead, the theist may argue that the debate\nbetween atheism and theism is not simply an argument about whether\n\u201cone more thing\u201d exists in the world. In fact, God is not\nto be understood as an entity in the world at all; any such entity\nwould by definition not be God. The debate is rather a debate about\nthe character of the universe. The theist believes that every object\nin the natural world exists because God creates and conserves that\nobject; every finite thing has the character of being dependent on\nGod. The atheist denies this and affirms that the basic entities in\nthe natural world have the character of existing \u201con their\nown.\u201d \n\nIf this is the right way to think about the debate, then it is not\nobvious that atheism is safer than theism. The debate is not about the\nexistence of one object, but the character of the universe as a whole.\nBoth parties are making claims about the character of everything in\nthe natural world, and both claims seem risky. This point is\nespecially important in dealing with moral arguments for theism, since\none of the questions raised by such arguments is the adequacy of a\nnaturalistic worldview in explaining morality. Such accounts need to\nexplain without watering the categories of morality down or otherwise\ndomesticating them and thereby depriving them of their most\ninteresting features. Evidentialists may properly ask about the\nevidence for theism, but it also seems proper to ask about the\nevidence for atheism if the atheist is committed to a rival metaphysic\nsuch as naturalism.\n",
