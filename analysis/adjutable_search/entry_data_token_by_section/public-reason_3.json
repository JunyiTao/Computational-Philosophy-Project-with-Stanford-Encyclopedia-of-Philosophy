    "main_text": "Why Public Reason? || Coercion and Respect\n1.3 Coercion and Respect\n\nA widely endorsed view regarding the moral basis of public reason\nappeals to a particular conception of what it means to treat others\nwith the respect they are due. On this view, we treat others as mere\nmeans, and not as ends, when we coerce them on the basis of reasons or\narguments that they could not reasonably accept. Charles Larmore, for\nexample, argues \u201cto respect another person as an end is to\nrequire that coercive or political principles be as justifiable to\nthat person as they presumably are to us\u201d (Larmore 1999, 608).\nConversely, \u201cif we try to bring about conformity to a rule of\nconduct solely by the threat of force, we shall be treating persons\nmerely as means, as objects of coercion, and not also as ends,\nengaging with their distinctive capacity as persons\u201d (Larmore\n1999, 607. Also see Larmore 2002 and Nagel 1987). Public reason is\npresented as the way of ensuring that our coercion of others is\nconsistent with respecting others as ends: we do this by ensuring our\ncoercive actions and institutions can be justified to all those who\nare the subjects of coercion. For a different appeal to respect, one\nthat is alleged to render the idea of public reason at least\nintelligible (rather than ground the idea) see (van Wietmarschen\n2021).\n\nBy grounding public reason in an account of how coercion can be\nsuitably respectful, this view limits the scope of public reason in\nways that may seem troubling. Not all laws and political institutions\nare coercive, and yet some noncoercive political institutions may seem\nappropriate topics of public reason. For example, which forms of\nmarriage, if any, ought to be granted legal recognition, or how the\nproceeds of a state-run lottery ought to be spent, might seem\nimportant topics of public reason, but fall outside the scope of\npublic reason on this basis (Bird 2014; Quong 2013). A related worry\nis this: if coercive actions uniquely stand in need of public\njustification, then this may make it difficult, or even impossible,\nfor the state to legitimately pursue many goals that are widely\nperceived to be permissible (Lister 2010; Lister 2013).\n",
