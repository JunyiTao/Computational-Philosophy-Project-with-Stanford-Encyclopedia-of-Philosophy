    "main_text": "Doing Without Justification? || Reliabilist Theories of Knowledge\n6.1 Reliabilist Theories of Knowledge\n\nOne candidate property for such a state is reliability. Part\nof what is problematic about lucky guesses is precisely that they are\nso lucky: such guesses are formed in a way such that it is unlikely\nthat they should turn out true. According to a certain form of\nknowledge reliabilism, it is unreliability, not lack of justification,\nwhich prevents such beliefs from amounting to knowledge. Reliabilist\ntheories of knowledge incorporate this idea into a reliability\ncondition on\n knowledge.[23]\n Here is an example of such a view:\n\n\nSimple K-Reliabilism:\n\nS knows that p iff\n\np is true;\nS believes that p;\nS\u2019s belief that p was produced by a reliable\ncognitive process.\n\n\n\nSimple K-Reliabilism replaces the justification clause in the\ntraditional tripartite theory with a reliability clause. As we have\nseen, reliabilists about justification think that justification for a\nbelief consists in a genesis in a reliable cognitive process. Given\nthis view, Simple K-Reliabilism and the JTB theory are equivalent.\nHowever, the present proposal is silent on justification. Goldman 1979\nis the seminal defense of reliabilism about justification; reliabilism\nis extended to knowledge in Goldman 1986. See Goldman 2011 for a\nsurvey of reliabilism in general.\n\nIn the following passage, Fred Dretske articulates how an approach\nlike K-reliabilism might be motivated:\n\n\nThose who think knowledge requires something other than, or\nat least more than, reliably produced true belief, something\n(usually) in the way of justification for the belief that one\u2019s\nreliably produced beliefs are being reliably produced, have,\nit seems to me, an obligation to say what benefits this justification\nis supposed to confer\u2026. Who needs it, and why? If an animal\ninherits a perfectly reliable belief-generating mechanism, and it also\ninherits a disposition, everything being equal, to act on the\nbasis of the beliefs so generated, what additional benefits are\nconferred by a justification that the beliefs are being\nproduced in some reliable way? If there are no additional benefits,\nwhat good is this justification? Why should we insist that no one can\nhave knowledge without it? (Dretske 1989: 95)\n\n\nAccording to Dretske, reliable cognitive processes convey information,\nand thus endow not only humans, but (nonhuman) animals as well, with\nknowledge. He writes:\n\n\nI wanted a characterization that would at least allow for the\npossibility that animals (a frog, rat, ape, or my dog) could know\nthings without my having to suppose them capable of the more\nsophisticated intellectual operations involved in traditional analyses\nof knowledge. (Dretske 1985: 177)\n\n\nIt does seem odd to think of frogs, rats, or dogs as having justified\nor unjustified beliefs. Yet attributing knowledge to animals is\ncertainly in accord with our ordinary practice of using the word\n\u201cknowledge\u201d. So if, with Dretske, we want an account of\nknowledge that includes animals among the knowing subjects, we might\nwant to abandon the traditional JTB account in favor of something like\nK-reliabilism.\n",
