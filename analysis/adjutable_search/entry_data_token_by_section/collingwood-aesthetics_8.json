    "main_text": "Practical Consequences: Art and Artists\n6. Practical Consequences: Art and Artists\n\nWith his theory of language in place, Collingwood takes the theory of\nart to be complete. At the end of section III we said that Collingwood\ndefines Art as imaginative expression, assuming that readers will\nagree once they have the mistakes of the technical or craft theory\npointed out for them. He then poses a particular theory of mind in\nwhich imagination and expression are built into the structural fabric\nof the mind, so that every intentional mental act is in some sense an\nact of an expressive imagination. That includes linguistic acts. In\nfact, properly understood, language encompasses all expressive acts\nwhatsoever, and every linguistic act is one way or another an\nexpressive act. Language and art become interchangeable (274).\n\u2018Every utterance\u2019, Collingwood says, \u2018and every\ngesture that each one of us makes is a work of art\u2019 (285).\nCollingwood next turns to \u2018practical\u2019 questions, of which\nwe will consider two: the relation of art to artists, and relation\nbetween the artist and the community. In answering them, we will\nconsider some questions naturally arising from the preceding.\n\nIf all activity is in that sense \u2018artistic\u2019, then it is\nnatural to wonder whether the theory has anything to tell us about\nart, that is, the peculiar business of the painter, the poet,\nthe musician and the like. Of course, most activity is undertaken with\na some purpose in mind or other, in which case it is craft, however\nhum-drum the theory of it might be. For example, I just ate an orange\nwhich I took from a bowl; the theory of what I did could be written\ndown in a practical guide to eating oranges. But surely I was\nconscious of eating the orange; by Collingwood\u2019s\ntheory, then, was I not expressing something? In that case, by the\nsame theory, just by being conscious, was I not engaged in art? And is\nthat not absurd?\n\nCollingwood says nothing in direct reply to this worry, but I think it\nobvious that the reply would be this. In so far as I was conscious of\nthe orange, it is true that I was involved in expression. But this\nconscious experience was un-sustained, fleeting, and lacking in depth\n(307). Furthermore, it took place in a mind that was busy with other\nthings, and which was dominated by an overarching purpose, namely to\neat the orange, whose sub-tasks include selecting it, peeling it,\nputting a section in my mouth, trying not spill too much juice, and so\non; all this would be written down in my practical guide to eating\noranges. Life, then, is full of \u2018artworks\u2019, but they are\nmostly shallow, unworthy of comment. However, there are times when\nconsciousness settles on something, such that the mental activity does\napproach the character of art, in the proper sense of the word.\nSitting in a park, for example, we might dwell on the look of an oak\ntree, or suddenly think of an original stanza of poetry, or a snatch\nof melody. These are instances of imaginative expression, and are\ncloser to what we should ordinarily call a work of art. But they are\nlikely to be lost, unless some record of the experience is made. The\n\u2018artist\u2019, then, is one who has these experiences of\nconsciousness more deeply than the average person, and who has\nmastered the practice of preserving them.\n\nBut the act of \u2018preserving them\u2019 has to be understood in a\nspecial sense. \u2018There is no question\u2019, says Collingwood,\n\u201cof \u2018externalizing\u2019 an inward experience which is\ncomplete in itself and by itself\u201d (304). Collingwood is denying\nthat a painter could in point of fact dispense with the medium, even\nif in principle he could (in sense of \u2018could in principle\u2019\nin which a man might run a hundred miles per hour). Instead, although\n\u2018you see something in your subject, of course, before you begin\nto paint it\u2019 (303), the \u2018experience develops itself and\ndefines itself in your mind as you paint\u2019 (ibid.). The\nwork of art develops by means of positive feedback between painting\nand experience. What develops is the \u2018total imaginative\nexperience\u2019 that Collingwood identifies as the work of art,\nstrictly speaking (304). Again, the work of art proper is not to be\nidentified with the \u2018bodily work\u2019\u2014the painted\ncanvas, the sculpted bust\u2014but with the experience of it. What is\ntrue that in point of fact the imaginative experiences requires the\nbodily work; the human imagination is not able to hold within it\nanything approaching the richness made available by the plastic arts.\nIn particular, the \u2018outward element\u2019\u2014the bodily\nwork\u2014provides the sensuous content or impressions out of which\nthe conscious imagination generates ideas, constituting the\n\u2018total imaginative experience\u2019 (see Davies 2008 for more\non this issue).\n",
