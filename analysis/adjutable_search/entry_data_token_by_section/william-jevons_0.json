    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\n\nWilliam Stanley Jevons was born in Liverpool on 1 September 1835. His\nfather Thomas Jevons (1791\u20131855) was an iron merchant; his\nmother Mary Anne Roscoe (1795\u20131845) grew up in an intellectual\nand artistic milieu. The railway boom crisis of 1847 caused the\nbankruptcy of the family firm. William Stanley Jevons went to\nUniversity College School in London in 1850, and in 1851 to University\nCollege. He studied chemistry under Graham and Williamson, two\npioneers in the development of atomic theory and the theory of\nmolecular motion. Another major influence at University College was\nAugustus De Morgan (1806\u20131871), with his courses on mathematics\nand logic. Jevons left University College without taking his\ndegree. In 1854 he travelled to Sydney, in order to become an\nassayer at the Australian mint. Jevons devoted much time to private\nstudy. His work covered many different areas: railway policy,\nmeteorology, protection, land policy, cloud formation, gunpowder and\nlightning, geology, etc. Jevons left Australia in 1859 and returned to\nUniversity College to complete his education. The early 1860s are\nimportant for Jevons' intellectual development, and he reports in his\ndiary that he received significant insights in both economics and\nlogic: a \u201ctrue comprehension of value\u201d (Black 1981: 120,\nLa Nauze 1953) and the \u201csubstitution of similars\u201d (Black\n& K\u00f6nekamp 1972: 179).\n\n\nJevons received his MA degree in 1862, and was awarded the gold\nmedal \u2018in the third branch\u2019 which included logic, moral\nphilosophy, political philosophy, history of philosophy and political\neconomy. In 1863 Jevons became a tutor at Owens College,\nManchester, and in 1865 a lecturer in political economy and\nlogic. In 1867 Jevons married Harriet A. Taylor, and they\nsubsequently had three children. The family moved to London in\n1876, on his taking up a chair at University College. \nJevons' short life came to an end in 1882, when he drowned near\nHastings.\n",
