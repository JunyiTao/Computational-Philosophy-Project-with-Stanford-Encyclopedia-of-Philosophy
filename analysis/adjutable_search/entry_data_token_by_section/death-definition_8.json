    "main_text": "Further Possibilities || Death as a Cluster Concept not Amenable to Classical Definition\n4.2 Death as a Cluster Concept not Amenable to Classical Definition\n\nMost discussions of the definition and determination of death assume\nthat there is a uniquely correct definition of death. Definitions,\nclassically understood, are supposed to state necessary and jointly\nsufficient conditions for the correct application of a word or\nconcept. They may be thought to capture de re essences\nexisting independently of human thought, language, and interests, or\nde dicto essences determined solely by linguistic meaning.\nThe major approaches we have considered have tried both to define\ndeath by capturing its essence and to advance a standard for\ndetermining human death that coheres with the definition. But what if\nthe term \u201cdeath\u201d cannot be defined in any such way?\n\nOne might insist that death can be defined, as the competing\ndefinitions demonstrate. But, of course, the trick is to define the\nterm adequately. For example, the organismic definition\u2014death as\nthe irreversible cessation of functioning of the organism as a\nwhole\u2014makes no reference to consciousness. Yet surely, one might\nargue, any organism that maintains consciousness should count as alive\neven if the organism as a whole has irreversibly ceased to function\n(whether or not this possibility is merely theoretical). Definitions\nassociated with the higher-brain approach\u2014such as human death as\nthe irreversible loss of mind\u2014implausibly imply that a PVS\npatient is dead despite exhibiting spontaneous breathing and\ncirculation, brainstem-mediated reflexes, and the like. The best\nexplanation for the shortcomings of leading efforts to define death,\nthe argument continues, is that death is not amenable to definition in\nterms of necessary and sufficient conditions (Chiong 2005). Let's\nconsider two distinct ways this thesis might be developed.\n\nFirst, one might argue that the concept of death exhibits only\n\u201cfamily resemblance\u201d relations among its instances, as\nWittgenstein argued was the case for the concepts of game,\nlanguage, and many others (Wittgenstein 1953). There are\nvarious features of an organism that count towards its being dead, yet\nthere is no authoritative list of features all of which must be\nsatisfied for it to be dead. Each of the following, for example, seems\nrelevant: unconsciousness, absence of spontaneous efforts to breathe,\nabsence of heartbeat, inertness, lack of integrated bodily functions,\nincapacity to grow, and physical decay. If all of these conditions are\npresent, an organism has surely died. But producing an authoritative\nshortlist of necessary and sufficient conditions seems futile. One\nscholar has advanced a parallel claim about the concept of life:\n\nWhen some property is central to the cluster\u2014as I've argued\nconsciousness is\u2014then possessing only this one property may be\nsufficient for membership in [the class of living things]. However,\nmerely possessing one or several properties that are peripheral to the\ncluster may not be sufficient for membership. [S]ome robots are\norganizationally complex and functionally responsive, though\nintuitively not alive (Chiong 2005, 26).\n\n\nAnother direction in which to take the thesis that death is not\namenable to classical definition is to argue that death is a natural\nkind whose essence may be obscure. Kripke influentially argued that\nnatural kinds\u2014kinds determined by nature rather than by human\nthinking, language, or interests\u2014often resist adequate\ndefinition because their essential features may be entirely unknown to\nthose referring to the kind in question (Kripke 1970). To define a\nterm by reference to the features people originally used to pick out\nthe kind in question won't do, because those features may be\naccidental, not essential, and speakers may even be mistaken about\nthem. Those naming the kind whale might have thought whales\nwere the largest fish in the ocean, but whales are not fish and their\nsize relative to other creatures is a contingent matter. We can refer\nmeaningfully to whales, to the creatures picked out by the term\nwhale (the name for the kind), without knowing the essential\nfeatures of whales, features likely to involve subtle biological\ndetails. Perhaps death, too, is a natural kind whose essence is\nobscure (a possibility entertained in Chiong 2005, 24\u201325). A\nlikely challenge to this argument is that we already know a great deal\nabout the physical processes involved in death, making it unlikely\nthat death has a hidden essence the failure to discover which impedes\nadequate definition.\n\nImportantly, though, one can claim that death is a natural kind\nwithout accepting any kind of essentialism. An alternative to the\nessentialist conception is the homeostatic property cluster theory of\nnatural kinds (Millikan 1999). On this view, natural kinds do not, or\nat least need not, share essential properties. They are comprised by\nmembers sharing a stable cluster of similarities, which are brought\nabout by \u201chomeostatic causal mechanisms\u201d (such as, in the\ncase of species, common developmental programs and selective\npressures). On this view, X (e.g., a fetus) might be a member of a\nnatural kind (e.g., our species) despite lacking one of the properties\n(e.g., the potential for rationality) among the cluster of\nsimilarities. Death and its opposite, life, might similarly be natural\nkinds lacking essences, each kind being associated with a cluster of\nproperties that tend to go together and support one another without\nbeing necessarily coinstantiated (see, e.g., Chiong 2005). If\nso, death cannot be defined in a set of necessary and sufficient\nconditions\u2014in which case no such definition can justify a\nparticular standard.\n\nIf death has no essence and resists definition, what is the upshot?\nOne possible inference\u2014that the boundaries of death are\nvague\u2014would partially merge this approach with the previous one,\nwhich construed death as a process. We have noted that one response to\nthe claim of vague boundaries (the response favored in the previous\napproach) is to embrace several lines, each for a different purpose,\nin determining death. Another possibility is to understand the vague\nboundaries as inviting discretion in the matter of producing a single\nstandard of death. So long as a particular standard does not have\nclear and highly implausible implications, it is admissible for\nconsideration on this view. Society may then select, among admissible\nstandards, whichever is most attractive for practical purposes. It has\nbeen argued, along these lines, that the higher-brain standard is\ninadmissible for implying that those in PVS are dead while the\ntraditional cardiopulmonary standard is inadmissible for implying (in\nprinciple) that a still-conscious individual might be dead, clearing\nthe ground for the whole-brain standard, which has no fatal\nimplications and is attractive from a practical standpoint (Chiong\n2005).\n\nHaving already explored difficulties (and strengths) of each standard,\nhow might we evaluate the more general thesis that death is not\namenable to classical definition? One strategy open to critics of this\nreasoning, of course, is to argue that some definition is adequate.\nAnother is to defend the disaggregation of death, as previously\ndiscussed. A third strategy would be to argue that our failure thus\nfar to produce an adequate definition does not mean that none is\npossible. Some concepts can be adequately captured by classical\ndefinitions even if it is difficult to produce them. It would appear\npremature, therefore, to render a judgment on the success of the\npresent approach to understanding human death.\n",
