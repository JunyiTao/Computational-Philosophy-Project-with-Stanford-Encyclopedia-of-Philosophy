    "main_text": "Semantics || Meaning and Extension\n2.1 Meaning and Extension\n\nAs well as having a range of entities to which it applies, the common\nnoun \u201cbachelor\u201d has a meaning; it means man who has\nnever been married. Is the same true of names?\n\u201cSocrates\u201d certainly applies to things. It applies, most\nobviously, to the founder of Western philosophy. When understood as a\ngeneric name (see\n Section 1),\n \u201cSocrates\u201d applies to several individuals: to a first\napproximation, all those who are called \u201cSocrates.\u201d But\ndoes \u201cSocrates\u201d also possess a meaning?\n\nSome names have meanings in a sense. I have heard \u201cMerlot\u201d\nused on the playground to summon a child, and knew of a married couple\nwhose respective names were \u201cSunshine\u201d and\n\u201cMoonlight.\u201d These names, we would say, have meanings.\n\u201cMoonlight,\u201d for instance, means light from the\nMoon. Something similar goes on when we say that\n\u201cTheodore\u201d means gift of god, or interpret a\nMohawk name with a verb phrase. But this sense of meaning turns out\nnot to be the one we are after.\n\nConsider that for \u201cbachelor\u201d the meaning\u2014man who\nhas never been married\u2014is also what determines the\nnoun\u2019s range of application. When the noun\n\u201cbachelor\u201d applies to someone, it\u2019s because they are\na man who has never been married. And when it fails to apply to\nsomeone, it\u2019s because they are not. By contrast, the kind of\nmeaning just canvassed for the names \u201cMerlot\u201d or\n\u201cMoonlight\u201d places no direct constraint on who they apply\nto. One may be named \u201cMerlot\u201d, and so fall within the\nname\u2019s range of application, no matter what relationship one\nbears to the wine grape variety, Merlot (Mill 1843: 34).\nMoreover, a relationship to the grape does not constitute the reason\nfor the name applying.\n\nIn this long tail of the article on semantics, we will confine\nourselves to the question of whether names have a meaning in the sense\nthat \u201cbachelor\u201d does. Do they have a meaning that\ndetermines, or restricts, their extension\n(i.e., their range of application or reference)? As we will see, even\npursuing this reduced target, philosophers have had to consider a\nseries of foundational questions about language and meaning. It is not\noff-limits to ask a different question about names, or to think about\ntheir meaning in some other way, but this question will open a path\nthrough the important topics in the semantics of names, and indeed the\nphilosophy of language.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the generic name \u201cAlice\u201d. Consider\nthe range of individuals to which it applies. Unlike the range of\n\u201cbachelor\u201d, this set is not united under a brief\ndefinition, but consists of all the various people (including Alice\nCooper), and perhaps things, referred to by (occurrences of) the name\n\u201cAlice\u201d. A natural view, then, is that the individual\nreferential relationships are what\u2019s basic here, and any\ngeneralization concerning a generic name\u2019s range of application\nis based on them, rather than the other way around. According to this\nview, there is no general meaning of the name, responsible for\ndetermining to whom or to what it correctly applies. While it is\npossible to articulate a (complex) condition that correctly sorts\nAlices from non-Alices on some basis other than those referential\nrelationships (for instance, a disjunction consisting of each\nAlice\u2019s unique time and place of birth), it is clear that any\nsuch condition is based on those pre-existing relationships, rather\nthan being, with any plausibility, their originating source.\n\nThe only concise way of delimiting the range of generic\n\u201cAlice\u201d is with a metalinguistic feature, such as\nbeing named \u201cAlice\u201d. And indeed some have\ndefended a metalinguistic account of the\nmeaning of generic names (see\n Section 2.10\n below). The challenge for the account is to distinguish the relevant\nfeature from that of being in the extension of\n\u201cAlice\u201d, which clearly cannot determine the extension\nin the robust sense required of a meaning (Kripke 1980: 68; Geurts\n1997: 326ff; Bach 2002: 83; Gray 2014).\n\nNext consider the specific name \u201cSocrates.\u201d It refers to a\ncertain citizen of Athens, and, in contrast to the generic case, this\n(unitary) extension may be delimited concisely without appeal to its\nonomastic features. Moreover, just like \u201cbachelor,\u201d\n\u201cSocrates\u201d appears in (some) dictionaries along with an\nexplanation supplying just this kind of non-linguistic identifying\ninformation. The following is from Lexico (see the link in Other\nInternet Resources):\n\n\n(469\u2013399 BC), Greek philosopher. As represented in the writings\nof his disciple Plato, he engaged in dialogue with others in an\nattempt to define ethical concepts by exposing and dispelling error\n(the Socratic method). Charged with introducing strange gods and\ncorrupting the young, Socrates was sentenced to death and died by\ndrinking hemlock.\n\n\nOf course, the majority of specific names do not appear in any\ndictionary. Moreover, it should not be thought that dictionary\n\u201cdefinitions\u201d always give the meaning of the word they\nappear under (one entry for \u201cSocrates\u201d on Wiktionary just\nsays \u201cA male given name of mostly historical use\u201d). But\nsuppose we have a condition satisfied by, and only by, the referent of\n\u201cSocrates\u201d; one which is, moreover, listed below the name\nin certain dictionaries. For the sake of argument, suppose it is\nthe teacher of Plato and Xenophon. Would it follow that\n\u201cSocrates\u201d meant the teacher of Plato and\nXenophon?\n\nNot necessarily. First note that, prima facie,\n\u201cSocrates\u201d simply does not mean the teacher of Plato\nand Xenophon. While we would agree that Socrates was the\nteacher of Plato and Xenophon, we would not be inclined to say that\nthis is what the word \u201cSocrates\u201d means. By\ncontrast, we are happy to say that \u201cbachelor\u201d means\nman who has never been married.\n\nSimilarly, though a dictionary might offer a definition of\n\u201ccat\u201d as domestic animal with retractile claws,\nwe would not be inclined to say that \u201ccat\u201d meant\ndomestic animal with retractile claws, though we would admit\nthat cats were such animals. Even if cats are the only\ndomestic animals in existence with retractile claws, it does not seem\ncorrect to say that this is the meaning of \u201ccat\u201d. The\nmeaning of a word is something more than just an accurate description\nof the contents of its extension.\n\nIn the first place, a condition that selects the correct range for a\nword is not necessarily the condition that determines that the word\nhas that range. Suppose all and only ascetics have matted hair. Still,\n\u201cascetic\u201d doesn\u2019t mean person with matted\nhair, because having matted hair, though it may be a\ndistinguishing mark of ascetics, is not what makes someone an ascetic.\nBut even supposing our condition is the one in virtue of which\n\u201cSocrates\u201d applies to the relevant Athenian, it still\ndoesn\u2019t follow that it is the meaning of \u201cSocrates\u201d.\nIt may yet be that \u201cSocrates\u201d doesn\u2019t have a meaning\n(compare Kripke 1980: 32\u201333). Though we take the meaning of a\nword to determine its range of application, we do not assume the\nconverse, that whatever determines the range of application of a word\nmust be its meaning. We allow that names might work differently from\n\u201cbachelor\u201d. Their extension might be determined by\nsomething other than a meaning; for instance, their previous use\n (Section 2.7).\n\nTo put it another way, the question as to whether a name has a meaning\nis not trivial. The name \u201cSocrates\u201d refers to a particular\nAthenian, and, unless reference is metaphysically basic, there must be\nsome feature of the world in virtue of which it does (cf. Kripke 1980:\n88, fn.38). However, this feature may or may not comprise the meaning\nof the specific name \u201cSocrates\u201d. It is really a further\nquestion whether this feature is semantic or meta-semantic, whether it\nis part of the meaning, or whether it establishes the name\u2019s\nreference without belonging to its meaning. The theory of (nominal)\nreference (see the entry on Reference) should be distinguished from\nthe\u2014intertwined\u2014theory of the semantics of names (Dickie\n2011).\n",
