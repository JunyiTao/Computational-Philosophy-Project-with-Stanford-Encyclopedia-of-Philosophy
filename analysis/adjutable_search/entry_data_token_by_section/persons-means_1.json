    "main_text": "Using Another\n2. Using Another\n\nIn order to treat another merely as a means or just\nuse him, an agent must use the other or treat him as a means. But when\ndoes someone count as doing that? As noted, using others or treating\nthem as means is often morally permissible. In everyday discourse,\nexpressions such as \u201cShe used me\u201d can mean she\njust used me, or treated me merely as a means and so\ncan imply a negative evaluation of action or attitude. But for our\npurposes talk of a person using another or treating him as a means\nimplies no such moral judgment.\n\nAccounts of treating others merely as means sometimes leave implicit\nthe notions of using another they rely on (Kleingeld 2020). Some\npoints regarding what using another does or does not amount to seem\nuncontroversial. It does not seem sufficient for us to count as using\nanother as a means that we benefit from what the other has done\n(Nozick 1974: 31\u201332). If, on her usual route, a runner derives\nenjoyment from the singing of a stranger who happens to be walking by,\nshe does not appear to be treating the stranger as a means. Moreover,\nnot all cases of an agent\u2019s intentionally doing something in\nresponse to another are cases of her using the other as a means. If\nsomeone frowns at another approaching, for example, he might not\nthereby be using the other at all; he might simply be expressing that\nthe other is unwelcome.\n\nHowever, inquiry reveals challenges in specifying what using another\namounts to. We might say that an agent uses another or, equivalently,\ntreats her as a means just in case the agent intentionally does\nsomething to the other in order to secure or as a part of securing one\nof his ends (Kerstein 2009: 166). For example, a passenger uses a bus\ndriver if he boards her bus in order to get across town; a wife treats\nher husband as a means if she lies to him so that his birthday party\nwill be a surprise; and a victim treats a mugger as a means if she\npunches him in order to escape from his grasp. In contrast, a pilot\nwho drops bombs solely in order to kill enemy combatants might foresee\nthat innocent bystanders will be harmed. Yet if he does not\nintentionally do anything to the bystanders, then he does not treat\nthem as means, according to this\n account.[5]\n\nBut does the account count too much as treating another as a means?\nSuppose that an usher at a concert is trying to prevent a small child\nfrom falling through railing on a balcony. She pushes a spectator out\nof the way to get to the child. The specification we are considering\nimplies that the usher has used the spectator as a means; for she has\nintentionally done something to her (i.e., pushed her aside) in order\nto attain an end (i.e., to get to the child). Some might say that the\nusher has treated the spectator in some way, namely, as an obstacle to\nbe displaced. Yet she has not used the spectator.\n\nIn order for an agent to count as using another, it is not enough that\nshe do something to the other in order to realize some end of hers,\nsome have suggested. She must also intend the presence or\nparticipation of some aspect of the other to contribute to the\nend\u2019s realization (Scanlon 2008: 106\u2013107; Guerrero 2016:\n779). The usher does not intend the spectator\u2019s presence or\nparticipation to play any role in her preventing the child from\nfalling. She thinks of her simply as \u201cin the way\u201d. On one\naccount, an agent uses another (or, equivalently, uses or treats\nanother as a means) if and only if she intentionally does something to\nor with the other in order to realize her end, and she intends the\npresence or participation of the other to contribute to the\nend\u2019s realization (Kerstein 2013: 58). On this account, an agent\ncan count as using another when she is striving to benefit him. For\nexample, a physician giving a patient a treatment to save his life is\nusing the patient. Some find this implication of the account\nimplausible (Parfit 2011:\n 222).[6]\n Others do not, pointing to cases such as that of a physician using a\npatient in a study of a new drug in order to ameliorate the\npatient\u2019s condition.\n\nIn any case, consistent with this account, an agent might use another\nthrough using the other\u2019s rational, emotional, or physical\ncapacities. A tourist might ask someone for directions, using the\nother\u2019s knowledge to get to his destination; a politician might\nuse his constituents\u2019 fear of crime to gain their support for\nmore spending on law enforcement; a doctor might use a vein from a\npatient\u2019s leg to repair her heart. One important question left\nunanswered by this and other accounts of treating another as a means\nis one of scope. For example, does an agent use another if he uses\nbiospecimens (e.g., cells) or information (e.g., concerning social\nmedia activity) derived from the other? If so, then the scope of a\nconstraint on treating others merely as means would extend to the\npractices of biobanks and technology companies.\n",
