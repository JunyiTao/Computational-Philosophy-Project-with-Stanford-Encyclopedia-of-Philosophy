    "main_text": "\n\nThe intellectual biography of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von\nNettesheim (1486\u20131535) provides us with significant proof of a\ncultural crisis in the Renaissance. The most striking aspect of his\nheritage is the seemingly paradoxical coexistence of a comprehensive\ntreatise on magic and occult arts, De occulta philosophia libri\ntres (Three Books on Occult Philosophy), written in\n1510, but then reworked, substantially enlarged, and finally published\nin 1533, and a rigorous refutation of all products of human reason,\nDe incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum et artium atque\nexcellentia verbi Dei declamatio invectiva (On the\nUncertainty and Vanity of the Arts and Sciences: An Invective\nDeclamation), printed in 1530. Esoteric literature and\ninquisitorial handbooks invariably quoted Agrippa, the celebrated (or\nexecrated) Archimagus; bibliographies on skepticism granted\nhim a long lasting, but not entirely deserved, reputation as one\n\u201cwho professed to overturn all the science\u201d (Naud\u00e9\n1644: 44\u201345). Actually, both works, as well as all of\nAgrippa\u2019s other writings, are clearly defined moments in a\nbroader philosophical, religious, and moral meditation on the social\nsignificance of learning in his own time. The \u201cparadox\u201d\nwith which Agrippa challenges his readers lies precisely in the\nsimultaneous presence of two speculative concerns, which are scattered\nin different texts, but which express, in spite of their apparent\ninconsistency, a complex cultural and religious project. De\nvanitate performs the epistemological function of the pars\ndestruens, identifying the causes and the historical\nresponsibilities for the general spiritual wreckage of Christian\nsociety, and introducing the proposal contained in the pars\nconstruens. De occulta philosophia, recovering\n\u201ctrue magic\u201d in the framework of Neoplatonic metaphysics\nand Hermetic theology, offers humankind a wonder-working knowledge,\none which is able to restore human cognitive and practical\ncapacities.\n\nIn order to understand the internal coherence of Agrippa\u2019s\nintellectual journey, his entire oeuvre has to be taken into\naccount. The task is made more difficult because of his specific\nwriting strategy, which entailed hiding his true purposes beneath a\nmound of borrowed material and erratic juxtapositions. This style of\nthought and exposition requires Agrippa\u2019s readers to piece\ntogether his \u201cscattered meaning\u201d (dispersa\nintentio) and to search for the theoretical message which is\nknowingly concealed within an unsystematic exposition. The literary\ntechnique of spreading knowledge in disguise, typical of the\nsapiential tradition, turned out to be increasingly important for most\nRenaissance intellectuals, who were \u201cforced to create spaces for\nthemselves by merging learning with prophecy\u201d (Celenza 2001:\n128). In addition, Agrippa composed his texts by gathering a wide\nrange of concepts and quotations from ancient and contemporary\nsources, which were removed from their original context and\nre-composed in a new explanatory structure. Such a way of\nde-constructing and re-constructing his cultural models should be\nconsidered in the light of Agrippa\u2019s ideological program. By\n\u201cre-writing\u201d his sources, he uncovered presuppositions and\nimplications, which the sources themselves often left unsaid, and he\nconnected together, in a single coherent design, arguments and points\nof view which remained separate in contemporary discussions. In this\nway, he added a \u201cpolitical\u201d meaning to the new text which\nwas not present in the purely cultural or religious critique put\nforward by his sources. This emphasis on the civic function of\nphilosophy can be regarded as the most characteristic and\n\u201coriginal\u201d element in Agrippa\u2019s works.\n",
