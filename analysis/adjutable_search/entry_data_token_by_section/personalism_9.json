    "main_text": "Characteristics of personalist thought || Self-determination\n6.4 Self-determination\n\n\nMan\u2019s intellectual nature, which according to Boethius is the\ndistinguishing characteristic of personhood, is also the font of\nfreedom, subjectivity, immortality, and man\u2019s cognitive and moral\nlife. It is as a rational being, and therefore as a person, that the\nindividual can distinguish true from false and good from\nevil. Therefore science and morality are proper to persons. Because\nthe person possesses a spiritual nature, the source of its action is\ninternal to itself and not extrinsic.\n\n\nPersonalists insist that in his contact with the world the human\nperson acts not in a purely mechanical or deterministic way, but from\nthe inner self, as a subjective \u201cI,\u201d with the power of\nself-determination.  Possession of free will means that the human\nperson is his own master (sui iuris). Self-mastery and\nfreedom characterize personal beings; a free being is a person. The\nperson\u2019s power of self-determination explains the non-transferable\nnature of personality.  His incommunicability does not only refer to\nthe person\u2019s uniqueness and unrepeatability. What is incommunicable or\ninalienable in a person is intrinsic to that person\u2019s inner self and\nto the power of self-determination. No one can substitute his act of\nwill for another\u2019s.\n\n\nIn what does self-determination consist? A classic distinction\nseparates \u201chuman acts\u201d (actus humani) from\nso-called \u201cacts of man\u201d (actus hominis). An act\nof man describes something that \u201chappens\u201d in the subject\nwhereas a properly human act ascribes free and responsible authorship\nof the act to the subject. The element of interior causality is\nreferred to as self-determination. This self-determination involves a\nsense of efficacy on the part of the acting subject, who recognizes\nthat \u201cI act\u201d means that \u201cI am the efficient\ncause\u201d of my action. One\u2019s sense of efficacy as an acting person\nin relation to the action performed is in turn closely connected to\none\u2019s sense of responsibility for the activity. This experience on the\nphenomenological level draws attention to the will as the person\u2019s\npower of self-determination, while at the same time making clear that\nself-determination is a property of the person himself, and not just\nof the will. It is the freedom of the person as such, through his\nwill.\n\n\nYet self-determination does not only describe the causality of the\naction, but also of the one acting. In acting, the person not only\ndirects himself toward a value, he determines himself as\nwell. He is not only the efficient cause of his actions, but is also\nin some sense the creator of himself, especially his moral self. By\nchoosing to carry out good or bad actions, man makes himself a morally\ngood or bad human being. Action is organically linked to becoming. By\nfree moral action the personal subject becomes good or bad as a human\nbeing. When a person acts, he acts intentionally toward an object, a\nvalue which attracts the will to itself. At the same time,\nself-determination points inward toward the subject himself. As a\nresult of this, the human being is capable of existing and acting\n\u201cfor itself,\u201d or is capable of a\ncertain autoteleology. This means that the person determines\nnot only his own ends but also becomes an end for himself. The person\nis not only responsible for his actions, he is also responsible for\nhimself, for his moral character and identity. Freedom means that one\nis responsible for one\u2019s choices but also for one\u2019s self.\n\n\nFreedom and self-determination also bear a close relation to another\ncharacteristic of the person\u2019s spiritual nature: creativity. Freedom\nas a property of the person allows the person to create through\nthought and action. The will is not simply the executor of the\nintellect\u2019s reasoned conclusions. The intellect presents a variety of\ngoods to be realized, none of which imposes itself in such a way as to\nbe necessarily desired or chosen above the others. The person himself\ndecides spontaneously and freely, and thus determines his own moral\nvalue and identity. \u201cThis particular good I am choosing has\nvalue for me according to the \u2018me\u2019 that I freely desire\nand choose to be.\u201d\n",
