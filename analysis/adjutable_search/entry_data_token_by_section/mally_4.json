    "main_text": "Ontology and Logic || Mally\u2019s Dynamic Ontological Conceptions\n2.4 Mally\u2019s Dynamic Ontological Conceptions\n\n\nIn his later works, Mally criticized Meinong\u2019s \u201cstatic\nconception\u201d of objects (Mally 1935, 1938b, 1971).\nMeinong and many other philosophers shared and still share the belief\nthat the world is constituted by completely determined elements or\ncompletely determined individual things and processes which taken\ntogether make up the universe. Christian von Ehrenfels\n(1859\u20131932), a student and friend of Meinong, doubted this view\nby pointing to the Gestaltproblem: when we consider a definite shape or\nGestalt, the parts of the shape are determined by the whole. For\nexample, the colored parts of the shape, when considered in their\nenvironment, differ from what they appear to be when each single part\nis presented to a spectator in isolation. Mally was influenced by this\nobservation and added that such colored parts, in isolation, are no\nlonger genuine elements of the whole, no longer determined objects.\nThus, whatever we can experience is\u2014as a whole\u2014only\nvaguely determined: the borderlines of things become more or less\nblurred; sometimes they appear sharper as in the case of tools,\nsometimes more hazy as in the case of clouds.\n\n\nAccording to Mally, reality objectively tends to a separation of\nindividual things, but this separation can or will never fully be\nreached, but only approximated. In other words, ours is a world without\nexact individual things; instead it is a world with a dynamic nature,\nwith many tendencies or strivings (Strebungen). In Mally 1935, there\nare many examples from everyday life with which he wants show that\nsubjects do not primarily apprehend rigid or static individual things,\nbut rather tendencies of events. For example, a portrait painting does\nnot show how a person looks at a given point of time and place, it\nrather expresses a certain tendency by indicating a direction to which\nthe painting \u201cidealizes\u201d the given status. Or, a plane\nsurface of a lake reminds us of the geometrical concept of a plane\nfigure, but actually the lake is only approximately plane. In this\nsense, even the so-called natural laws are precise expressions of\nnatural tendencies which are never fully realized. Mally writes,\n\nNo longer material elements, but probabilities (this is the\ntendency) of describable forms of happenings are the final\napprehensible which can be met by researching reality.
