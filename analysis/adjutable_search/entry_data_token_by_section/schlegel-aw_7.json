    "main_text": "Translation Theory\n5. Translation Theory\n\nAlthough Schlegel himself denied that he had developed a translation\ntheory (IB: I, 256), many of his texts are devoted to the analysis of\nexisting translations (such as Voss\u2019s and B\u00fcrger\u2019s\ntranslations of Homer) as well as to the commentary on his own work as\ntranslator. Schlegel was almost certainly influenced by the work of\nJohann Gottfried von Herder, but his decision to avoid the elaboration\nof a systematic translation theory can be interpreted as the result of\na very precise theoretical position, namely that each text requires a\ndifferent procedure for its translation. As he affirmed in the\ncommentary to his Bhagavad-Gita translation, it all depends on the\nrelation between the two languages (IB: I, 256). In other words, for\nSchlegel, a translation theory as such is uninteresting unless it\ninvolves the exposition of the actual work undertaken with the texts,\ni.e., with the original text as well as with all the existing\ntranslations. Consequently, Schlegel\u2019s commentary and his\nsuggestions concerning Voss\u2019s translation of Homer are\naccompanied by a very detailed analysis of the Greek text together\nwith a comparative study of Voss\u2019s and B\u00fcrger\u2019s\nversions. Likewise, in his \u00dcber die Bhagavad-Gita,\nSchlegel analyzes all the different ways in which a particular word\n(such as \u2018yoga\u2019 or \u2018dharma\u2019) has been\ntranslated, creating thus a history of the translation. And although\nhis commentaries appear as a work in progress, they show a very\nprecise and carefully conceived methodology which was mostly valuable\nfor other translators and translation theorists. Very much as a\ncritique and response to Voss, Schlegel\u2019s translations need to\nbe understood as an example of the so called \u201cparadigm\nshift\u201d (cf. Robinson 1991 and Bernofsky 1997) that was taking\nplace within translation theories.\n\nFor Schlegel, a good translation is not necessarily a literal\ntranslation; the translator must be able to translate the spirit of\nthe text. He must follow the letter, but he must also be able to\n\u201ccapture some of the innumerable, indescribable marvels that do\nnot reside in the letter, but float above it like a breath of\nspirit!\u201d (SW: VII, 39). Thus, in an 1838 letter to Herrn Reimen,\nSchlegel explains that the aim of a translator should be to\n\u201cprovide those who have no access to the original with as pure\nand uninterrupted appreciation of the work as possible\u201d (SW:\nVII, 287). Anticipating Humboldt\u2019s distinction between the\n\u2018foreign\u2019 (das Fremde) and\n\u2018strangeness\u2019 (die Fremdheit)\u2014which he\nintroduced in the preface of his translation of the Agamemnon\nfrom 1816 \u2013, Schlegel also emphasizes that all translations\nshould avoid converting foreign texts into strange texts (Berman\n1992a: 154). As he had said in his Works of Homer by Voss, in\norder to translate a text from a different culture, the translator\nneeds to maintain the text\u2019s naturalness; s/he cannot convert it\ninto something strange, there is no necessity in violating the\nlanguage, in inventing a new language (SW: VII, 116). Indeed, what\nSchlegel reproached in Voss\u2019s translation of Homer was precisely\n\u201cto have created a much too \u2018strange\u2019 pidgin of\nGreek and German\u201d (Berman 1992a: 154). On the other hand,\nthough, as a translator and art-critic Schlegel was also concerned\nwith enabling the assimilation and comprehension of otherness, and\ncriticized strongly the way in which - especially French translations\n- tended to paraphrase passages from foreign texts in order to make\nthem seem more French (KS: I, 75\u201376, cf. Berman 1992a:\n36). Moreover, Schlegel believed that German culture and language (as\nopposed to other languages) provided much better conditions for good\ntranslations, i.e., translations that were able to assimilate a\ncertain foreignization, without becoming too\n\u2018strange\u2019.\n\nAlthough many of Schlegel\u2019s remarks may seem self-evident and\nelementary to translators today, they did not appear so at the time.\nIn fact they are the result of a very precise way of understanding\nlanguage. Schlegel\u2019s translation theories are very much\nconnected to his philosophy of language. It is within his explanatory\nobservations about the difficulty of translating Sanskrit terms that\nwe find a philosophical theory about the genealogy of abstract\nsignificance. All abstract concepts, he argues, are the result of a\nprogressive growing apart between an original sensual denotation and\nits future abstract meanings (IB: II, 248\u2013258). Therefore, the\ntranslator needs to make a decision between (a) finding a more or less\nneutral term in his own language that has a similar meaning to the\noriginal, sensual meaning (in this case he needs to explain the\nparticular use of this word); and (b) using all the meanings that the\noriginal word has been attached to. The problem in the latter case is\nthat one meaning does not relate to the other, and, what is worse, the\ntranslation loses the cohesion between all the different meanings, so\nthe reader is not always able to know in which way these different\nmeanings are bound.\n\nSchlegel describes the task of the translator as a voluntary and\nembarrassing slavery (IB: II, 254). It is never gratifying, because\nthe more he tries to make the best translation, the more he realizes\nhow impossible his task is: \n\n\nI have come to the conviction that translation is, though freely\nchosen, nevertheless a laborious bondage, an art without substance, a\nthankless craft; thankless not just because the best translation is\nnever esteemed as equal to an original, but also because the\ntranslator, the more he gains insight, must feel even more the\ninevitable imperfection of his work. (IB: II, 255) \n\n\nIn effect, Heine, criticized Schlegel\u2019s translations for\n\u201cpolishing his words ever so sweetly and fastidiously\u201d\n(Heine [1833] 1985: 25), Voss argued that Schlegel\u2019s Shakespeare\n\u201cwas not Shakespeare but Schlegel\u201d (quoted in Larson 1989,\n124) and there is an ongoing debate as to the extent to which Schlegel\nromanticizes Shakespeare (Bernofsky 1997: 180f.). And yet,\nthere also seems to be a consensus regarding the fact that his\ntranslations into German of the works of Shakespeare are still and by\nfar the best.\n",
