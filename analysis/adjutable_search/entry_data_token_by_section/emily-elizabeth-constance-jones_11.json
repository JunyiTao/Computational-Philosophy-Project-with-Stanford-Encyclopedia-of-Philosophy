    "main_text": "The Dualism of Practical Reason\n7. The Dualism of Practical Reason\n\nAs indicated above, Jones also made significant contributions to\nethics and moral psychology. This section will focus on her major\ncontribution to these areas\u2014her attempt at a resolution to a\nproblem that Sidgwick stated in his The Methods of Ethics\n(ME), but which he never resolved to his satisfaction: the\ndualism of practical reason.\n\nA central goal of ME is to determine the rules guiding\npractical rationality and to present these as\n\u201cmethods\u201d\u2014\u201crational procedures for determining\nright conduct in any particular case\u201d (78). ME argues at\nlength for the rationality of benevolence: that our actions should\nhave \u201cUniversal Good or Happiness\u201d as their goal (507).\nBut, alongside this primary rule or method, Sidgwick also recognizes a\nsecondary rule of self-love or egoism. The latter rule, he is forced\nto acknowledge, is equally rational: \u201ceven if a man admits the\nself-evidence of the principle of Rational Benevolence, he may still\nhold that his own happiness is an end which it is irrational for him\nto sacrifice to any other; and that therefore a harmony between\nthe maxim of Prudence and the maxim of Rational Benevolence must be\nsomehow demonstrated, if morality is to be made completely\nrational\u201d (498; emphasis added). \n\nThe dualism of practical reason is precisely this fact, that practical\nreason is guided by two distinct but potentially incompatible rules.\nThis incompatibility will not always rise to the surface, but there is\na possibility that the two methods give divergent results. As Sidgwick\nwrites, in such a case, \u201cpractical reason, being divided against\nitself, would cease to be a motive on either side\u201d(508). This\nwould be unacceptable for a moral rationalist like Sidgwick, who, in\nrequiring self-evidence of his methods would surely also require that\ntheir conjunction meet the same requirement. \n\nSidgwick\u2019s dissatisfaction with this state of affairs was not simply\nintellectual. As Bart Schultz notes in his biography: \n\nThe gloomy last line of the first edition of the Methods rang\nout like an English version of the \u201ccrisis of the\nEnlightenment\u201d, warning that practical reason might be reduced\nto a \u201cchaos.\u201d (2004, 15; note removed)\n\n\nSidgwick rejected a \u201cmetaphysical\u201d resolution of the\ndualism. On this view, selfless actions are rewarded in the afterlife,\nwith God or some other force guaranteeing that self-interest and\nbenevolence coincide. He similarly dismissed the view that the methods\ncoincide due to facts about our evolutionary history\u2014that\nselectional pressures have seen to it that what we desire for\nourselves is precisely what benefits the species as a whole. In each\ncase, we are asked to believe that the circumstances in which the\nmethods deliver conflicting results will simply not arise, either due\nto \u201cthe moral government of the universe\u201d or to the\ncontingencies of natural selection. \n\nSidgwick\u2019s rationalism had him set a high bar for ethical\npropositions\u2014that they have the certainty of \u201cany axiom in\nArithmetic or Geometry\u201d (507). Since the above resolutions fall\nfar short of these standards, he could not accept them. \n\nJones addressed the dualism on various occasions throughout her career\n(Jones 1894, 1894\u201395, 1895, 1909, 1917\u201318, 1920), and a full survey of\nthese discussions is not possible here. This section will focus on her\nmost considered response to the dualism, her late publication\n\u201cPractical Dualism\u201d (Jones 1917\u201318). Where relevant, I\nwill also quote from her roughly coeval entry on Sidgwick for the\nEncyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics (Jones 1920). \n\nJones\u2019s stated aim in \u201cPractical Dualism\u201d is to\n\u201cdeduce\u201d the rule of prudence (or rational self-interest)\nfrom benevolence (Jones 1917\u201318, 323): \u201cThe reasonableness of\nbenevolence implies the reasonableness of self-love\u201d (1920,\n504). The upshot is that we have reduced our fundamental principles to\none, thus solving the problem of the dualism of two methods. \n\nThe claim that benevolence entails self-love might strike us as\npuzzling. At least since The Republic, the thought has been\nthat, if there is an entailment, it should go in the opposite\ndirection: self-love entails benevolence, and, accordingly, it is in\nmy interest to promote the happiness of others. But as the following\nmakes clear, Jones\u2019s point is slightly different: \n\nIt would thus appear that Benevolence implies Self-Love, and Rational\nBenevolence irresistibly leads us back to the rationality of Self-Love\nas our starting-point. Similarly, in the precepts \u201cDo unto\nothers as ye would (reasonably would) they should do unto\nyou,\u201d \u201cLove your neighbour as\nyourself,\u201d it is implied that the love of self is logically\nprior to, and sets the standard for, love of our neighbour. (1917\u201318,\n324; see also 1920, 504)\n\n\nWhat Jones is claiming here is that the very formulation of\nbenevolence presupposes the rationality of self-love. If we\nhad no independent conception of the value of happiness, then neither\nself-love nor benevolence would be rationally binding. But the only\nway that I can come to grasp the value of happiness is by grasping it\nin my own case. If I grasp the value of your happiness for\nyou, it is only because I already grasp the value of my happiness\nfor me: \n\nNow, a man cannot experience, cannot directly know, any happiness but\nhis own. It must, therefore, be on the ground that his own\nhappiness is to himself ultimately and intrinsically\nvaluable, valuable in itself, that he can logically regard the\nhappiness of others as ultimately and intrinsically valuable to them.\nHis reasoned belief in the value for others of their own happiness\nmust be based, it can only be based, on his recognition of the value\nfor himself of his own happiness. (323; final emphasis added)\n\n\nMy appreciation of the intrinsic value of others\u2019 happiness to them\nis grounded in my appreciation of the intrinsic value of my happiness\nfor me. What this means logically is that the principle\npresupposes self-love. That is, the principle of benevolence\nis neither true nor false if the principle of self-love is false. (See\nthe entry on\n Presupposition.)\n \n\nThus it appears that when Jones writes that \u201crational\nbenevolence implies or includes the rationality of self-love\u201d\n(328; emphasis added) she does not have logical implication in mind\nbut rather the relation of presupposition. Moreover, this claim is\nitself far more plausible on the face of it than the claim of logical\nentailment. \n\nStill, the question arises, what does the claim of presupposition\nshow? It shows at least this much, that the two principles are\nconsistent\u2014relative to the assumption, as Jones is quick to\npoint out, that benevolence is itself non-contradictory (324). This is\na significant development, since Sidgwick\u2019s central concern was with\nthe compatibility of the two principles. If benevolence requires that\nself-love be true for it to be true (or false), then the two\nmust be consistent (assuming benevolence is). \n\nOne might challenge Jones\u2019s response in two ways. One might question\nher assumption that the rule of benevolence presupposes self-love in\nprecisely the way that the Golden Rule presupposes self-love. Broad\n(1930, 158\u20139), for example, held that benevolence has no such\npresupposition. On his view, the ethical hedonist (who advocates\nbenevolence) and the rational egoist have different conceptions of the\ngood\u2014\u201cmy Good [says the egoist] and your Good\u2026 are\nnot parts of a total Good.\u201d Since they involve distinct\nconceptions of the good, the formulation of the one position cannot\npresuppose the truth of the other. Nonetheless, since they make\nconflicting commands regarding certain conceivable situations, we\ncannot rationally subscribe to both. \n\nThe other concern is that she has, at best, shown that one who\nembraces benevolence cannot consistently reject self-love. But this\ndoes not give us a positive argument for the rational egoist to accept\nbenevolence. Jones does argue, in \u201cPractical Dualism,\u201d\nthat as humans we are by nature empathetic, often, through an innate\nimpulse, identifying our happiness with the happiness of others. While\nit may be possible to argue, on such a basis, that the mere possession\nof the concept of happiness makes us value it in others as much as we\nvalue it in ourselves, it remains the case that this is a\npsychological fact. While it may be so that we by nature are drawn to\nvalue in others what we value in ourselves, it does not follow that we\nrationally ought to do so simply because we do so\u2014or even that\nwe ought to do so\u2014in our own case. \n\nOstertag and Favia (2020) presents a more comprehensive account of\nJones\u2019s responses. See Soames (2014, 263\u201369) and the entries on\n Henry Sidgwick\n and\n Bertrand Russell\u2019s Moral Philosophy\n for more on the Sidgwickian background. \n",
