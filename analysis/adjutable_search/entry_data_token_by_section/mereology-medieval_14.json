Medieval examinations of identity over time,\nor persistence, are often occasioned by reflection on the maximal\nproposition associated with the Topic from the integral whole, which\nstates:\n\nIf the whole is, the part is.\n\n\nThis maximal proposition, however, implies\n\nIf the part is not, the whole is not.\n\n\nBut this seems to entail that if Socrates\u2019 hand does not exist,\nSocrates does not exist.\n\nThere is an innocent interpretation of this Topical maxim. Recall that\n\u201cthe whole x\u201d can mean the complete x.\nAccordingly, to say that the whole is destroyed if the part is\ndestroyed, is merely to say that the whole is incomplete or\n\u201cmutilated\u201d if a part is removed. It might also be the\ncase that \u201cthe whole x\u201d merely signifies all the\nparts of x taken together. On this reading, the maximal\nproposition would merely imply that, if x does not exist,\nthen the whole consisting of x and some other parts does not\nexist. And, indeed, Boethius seems to mean only this:\n\nFor if a part of the whole perishes, the whole\u2014namely, the\n[whole] whose one part was destroyed\u2014will not exist. (On\nDivision 879c [Magee 1998, 14]).\n\n\nBoethius\u2019 assertion that the whole consisting of x\nand all the rest will perish when x perishes leaves\nit open whether the remaining parts are still, say, Socrates or a\nhouse. Naturally, the creative parts had to be present in\norder to create Socrates or the house. For example, this sum of wood,\ncement, and nails is the sum of the creative parts of a house. If\nthere had been no nails, wood, or cement, there would have been no\nhouse. Still, commonsense tells us that the creative parts need not\nremain present after the house has been created. Some boards and some\nnails may be replaced in the house, but this does not compromise the\nexistence of this house.\n\nDespite the appeal of commonsense, there were some medieval\nphilosophers who took the maximal proposition to imply that if\nSocrates loses a finger, Socrates ceases to exist. At least at one\npoint in his career, Peter Abelard appears to seriously entertain the\nradical reading of the maximal proposition (Henry 1991, 92\u2013139).\nAbelard himself might have eventually backed away from this view\n(Martin 1998), but there are reports that suggest some of\nAbelard\u2019s followers, the so-called Nominales, wholeheartedly\nembraced the extreme interpretation of the maximal proposition. One of\nthe positions associated with the Nominales was that \u201cnothing\ngrows\u201d (nihil crescit), and there is a surviving\ncommentary on the Categories with Nominalist features where\nthe author argues that any addition, removal, or even relocation of a\npart compromises the identity of the thing itself (Ebbesen 1999, 397).\nThis extreme interpretation is derived from the judgment that each\nwhole is the same thing as a unique set of parts. This house must be\ncomposed out of these nails, these boards, and this cement. If I use\nother nails or other boards, I could make a house, but not this very\nhouse. This premise is no doubt controversial, but Abelard and many of\nhis contemporaries have principled reasons for holding it. Abelard\nbelieves that the ultimate pieces of the universe are tiny,\nindivisible bits of matter, souls, and perhaps some forms. The items\nthat we experience are composites of these elements. Each element is\nself-identical. Composite beings are individuated by the elements that\nmake them up, and in the case of complex, composite beings\u2014such\nas artifacts and substances\u2014by the arrangement that these bits\nhave. Given such a universe, it is quite plausible to assume that the\nidentity of a composite item is solely determined by its parts. It\nwould then easily follow that the removal or addition of a composing\nelement entails that the new whole is not identical to the old whole.\nAnother whole similar to the original might exist after the\nmereological change take place, but strictly speaking the two wholes\nare not identical.\n\nMost medieval philosophers are not as extreme as the Nominales. Of\ncourse, there are those parts that are required to keep the whole\nintact, but there are also those parts that can be lost without\ncompromising the integrity of the whole. If we were to cut off\nSocrates\u2019 head, he would perish. But if we amputate\nSocrates\u2019 right hand, it seems that Socrates would not cease to\nexist. He would merely lack a hand. The parts required to keep a whole\nintact are called \u201cprincipal\u201d. Ones that could be lost\nwithout compromising the integrity of the whole were called\n\u201csecondary\u201d parts (Anonymous Introductiones maiores\nMontane 71va\u201372rb; Albertus Magnus Commentarii in De\ndiv. tract. 2, ch. 5 (Loe ed., 33\u20134); Buridan Summulae\nde Dialectica 6.4.4). Examples of principal parts would be the\nfoundation of the house, the heart of a cat, and the brain of\nSocrates. Examples of secondary parts are a brick in the house, a\nstrand of hair belonging to the cat, and a fingernail of Socrates.\n\nIn the Twelfth century there was a heated debate about how to\ndetermine whether this or that part is principal (see Pseudo-Joscelin\nDe generibus \u00a7\u00a7 3\u201320 (2014, 122\u201329;\nArlig 2013), for as Abelard pointed out the following account is\ninsufficient:\n\nx is a principal part of y if and only if the\nremoval of x entails the destruction of y.\n\n\nAbelard reminds his audience that even the extremist can accept this\naccount of principal parts; the only difference is that on his account\nevery part is a principal part (Dialectica\n549\u201352).\n\nThe best answer that twelfth-century thinkers come up with is that a\nprincipal part of x is that which, when removed, compromises\nthe form of x (Pseudo-Joscelin De generibus\n\u00a7\u00a7 23\u20136 (2014, 130\u201331); Arlig 2013,\n106\u201310). Many later medieval philosophers followed suit. At\nleast in the case of substances, the substantial form could do the\nmetaphysical work of guaranteeing persistence through time and change\n(Pasnau 2011, 689\u201392). For example, we have already seen that\nBurley draws a distinction between the whole secundum formam\nand the material whole. The whole considered formally persists so long\nas the form persists. The whole considered materially is the only\nwhole compromised by changes in material parts (De toto et\nparte, 301). Most commonsense objects are identified with a whole\nconsidered with respect to form, and so there would be no reason to\nthink that these things are substantially compromised by material\nchanges. (The fate of artifacts, would be different, as their forms\nare merely accidental forms. A mereological change in the case of an\nartifact would seem to entail that the initial artifact is replaced by\nanother one. But later medieval philosophers do not seem to be all\nthat troubled by these implications. Whether theologians\ncould stomach all the consequences that this view of artifacts entails\n(for example, for whether something remains ritually pure after it has\nbeen chipped) may be another matter. But this is an area whether\nfurther research is needed.)\n\nThis basic Aristotelian picture is complicated, if not outright\naltered, by several very influential fourteenth-century thinkers,\nincluding Ockham and Buridan (Normore 2006; Pasnau 2011,\n692\u2013702). We will consider Buridan\u2019s theory of identity\nover time and change (Quaestiones super De generatione et\ncorruptione 1.13; Quaestiones in Physicam 1.10; with\nEnglish paraphrase in Pluta 2001). According to Buridan, there are\nthree senses of numerical sameness: (1) x is\n\u201ctotally\u201d the same in number as y, (2) x\nis \u201cpartially\u201d the same in number as y, and (3)\nx is numerically the same as y in a \u201cless\nproper\u201d way. Something is totally the same in number if all its\nparts remain the same and it neither acquires nor loses any parts. In\nthis strictest of senses, no corruptible thing whatsoever persists\nthrough mereological change. Something is partially the same in number\nif its \u201cmost principal part\u201d remains numerically the same.\nThis is the sense that allows us to claim that Socrates is numerically\nthe same man now as that man ten years ago. In particular, it is\nSocrates\u2019 intellective soul which is the principal part and\nguarantor of persistence through change. Finally, something is less\nproperly the same in number if there is merely a continuous succession\nof beings that maintain a similar shape, disposition, and form. This\nless proper mode of numerical sameness allows us to claim that the\nNile River here today is numerically the same river as the Nile back\nin Herodotus\u2019 time. While it is probably not a surprise to learn\nthat rivers are the same in number only in a less proper sense, it is\nstriking that Buridan goes on to assert that plants and non-rational\nanimals too can only be numerically the same in this less proper sense\n(Quaestiones super De gen. 1.13 (2010, 114\u201315)).\nBuridan\u2019s reason for thinking this is that non-rational\ncreatures do not have the sort of soul that can act as a guarantor of\nless proper identity; rather, non-rational souls are themselves\naltered when the material parts are altered. Thus, over the span of a\nnormal lifetime, neither the matter nor the form of a horse or an\norchid remains numerically the same in anything other than a less\nproper\n sense.[7]\n\nBuridan\u2019s account appears to commit him to the view that the\naddition or subtraction of even tiny and seemingly inconsequential\nparts can bring about substantial change: strictly speaking we do not\nhave one horse, but rather a succession of horses unified by three\nfacts, namely, (1) these successive beings have some of the same\nparts, (2) this line of succession is continuous, and (3) each member\nin the line of succession is a horse. The picture we get has many\nsimilarities to the accounts of identity that we get in early modern\nthinkers like Hobbes and Locke. Thus, it is tempting to think that we\nare witnessing in Buridan\u2019s work one more way in which the\nAristotelian scholastic edifice is being eroded to the point that it\nwill quickly crumble in the seventeenth century (see Pasnau 2011, 703\nf., and Lagerlund 2012, esp. pp. 481\u20132).\n",
