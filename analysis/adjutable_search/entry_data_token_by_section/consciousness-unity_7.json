    "main_text": "Disorders of Unified Consciousness\n4. Disorders of Unified Consciousness\n\nOne of the most interesting ways to study psychological phenomena is\nto see what happens when they take an abnormal form or break down.\nPhenomena that look simple and seamless when functioning smoothly\noften reveal all sorts of structure when they begin to malfunction.\nThe unity of consciousness can be damaged and/or distorted in both\nnaturally-occurring and experimental situations. What can we learn\nfrom these cases? \n\nAs a rough grouping tool, we will treat unified consciousness as\nbreaking down in ways that fit a two-by-two matrix. The cases we will\nconsider can be grouped according to whether unified consciousness\nappears to continue but in an unusual form, one instance of it\nsplitting into two for example, and situations in which it appears to\ndeteriorate more severely, to the point where it may even be said to\nhave been destroyed. And we will find examples of both kinds that\noccur at a time and across time. Indeed, some of the disorders that we\nwill examine are both at a time and across time.\n\nAt a time, situations of disorder in which unified consciousness is\nretained may take a number of forms. There are cases where\nconsciousness seems to split within one brain and body. The much\ndiscussed commissurotomies (brain bisection operations) are the best\nknown example. (Across time, the closest analogue may be dissociative\nidentity disorder, about which more shortly.) There may be cases in\nwhich a single occurrence of unified consciousness spans two bodies;\nsome have said this about some mirror twins. And there are cases in\nwhich the array of phenomena over which unified consciousness ranges\nbecomes strangely circumscribed: hemi-neglect and anosognosia are two\nexamples. (We will describe all these phenomena in more detail below.)\nWhat is interesting for our purposes is that in all these kinds of\ncases, those in which unified conscious seems to split, those (if any)\nin which it seems to span two bodies, and those in which its range\nseems to shrink, the unity itself seem to be intact. It has not been\ndestroyed or even damaged. It is just housed in an unusual way.\n\nThe cases just introduced contrast with situations in which we have\njust one instance of consciousness of some kind ranging over the usual\nphenomena or some of them, but where the unity, to dramatize a bit,\nappears to have shattered, not split or expanded or shrunk. In these\ncases, the unity of consciousness is not just unusually housed. It has\nbeen seriously compromised.\n",
