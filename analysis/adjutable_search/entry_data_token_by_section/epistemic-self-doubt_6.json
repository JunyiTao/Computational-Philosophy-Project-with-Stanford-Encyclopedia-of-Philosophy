    "main_text": "Calibration and Higher-Order Objective Probability || Evidential Calibration\n4.2 Evidential Calibration\n\nIt seems wrong that second-order evidence should always swamp the\nfirst-order verdict completely, so the calibration idea has been\nre-formulated so as to incorporate dependence on first-order evidence\nexplicitly, in the evidential calibration constraint\n(EC):\n\n\nWhen one\u2019s evidence favors q over not-q,\none\u2019s credence in q should equal the [prior] expected\nreliability of one\u2019s educated guess that q. (Sliwa &\nHorowitz 2015)\n\n\nYour educated guess corresponds to the answer that you have the\nhighest credence in. Reliability of such a guess is defined as the\nprobability that you would assign the highest credence to the true\nanswer if you had to choose, and as above this probability is\nunderstood as your propensity to guess correctly. What is used in EC,\nas in GC, is an expected rather than actual reliability so it is\nweighted by how likely you think each possible reliability level is.\nThe difference between GC and EC is that in the latter the calibration\nrequirement depends explicitly on which conclusion the first-order\nevidence actually supports. On this principle, Anton, who reasoned\ncorrectly with the first-order evidence, is rational to be .6\nconfident in q rather than not-q because q is the\nconclusion the first-order evidence actually supports. The\ncontribution of the second-order evidence is to reduce his confidence\nin that conclusion from a high value to .6.\n\nAccording to Sliwa and Horowitz EC implies that Ana is not rational to\nhave a .6 confidence in not-q because not-q is not the\nconclusion the evidence actually favors. It would be rational for her\nto have .6 confidence that q, the same as Anton. This claim\nhighlights ambiguities in the phrase \u201cone\u2019s educated guess\nthat q\u201d. Expected reliability is the probability that you\nwould assign the highest credence to the true answer, and the\nundermining evidence both Anton and Ana were given said that in the\nconditions they were in they had a 60% chance of their guess being the\nright\n answer.[3]\n If so, then neither of them have enough information to know the\nexpected reliability of a guess that q. If the\nprobabilities it appeared they were given, for one\u2019s guess about\nq whatever it is, are to be usable, then the phrase in EC would\nneed to be interpreted \u201cone\u2019s educated guess that q\nor not-q\u201d.\n\nThe fact that Ana did not actually guess that q makes for a\ndifficulty on either interpretation of the higher-order evidence and\nEC. Suppose the 60%-probability evidence they were given was indeed\nonly about guesses that q, and that \u201ceducated guess that\nq\u201d in EC refers only to guesses that q. If the\nword \u201cone\u2019s\u201d in the phrase \u201cone\u2019s\neducated guess that q\u201d refers narrowly to the individual\nEC is being applied to, then EC does not imply anything for Ana, since\nshe did not guess that q. If \u201cone\u2019s\u201d refers\nbroadly to anyone who guesses that q in the conditions Anton\nand Ana were in, then it does follow that what is rational for Ana is\nto believe q with 60% confidence. However, whether they are\ngiven general evidence about guesses that q or not-q, or\nseparate statistics on the success of q-guesses and of\nnot-q guesses, that higher-order evidence would have given Ana\nno means to correct herself. Because she got it wrong in the first\nstep by incorrectly concluding the first-order evidence supported\nnot-q she will also lack the means to correct herself, that is,\nto know whether she should be 60% confident in q or in\nnot-q. What EC says it is rational for her to do in the\nsituation is not something she has the ability to do. It might be\npossible to avoid these difficulties in a reformulation, but they are\nconsequences of the move in EC to add deference to the actual\nfirst-order evidential support relation.\n\nEC rules out many cases of bootstrapping that level-splitting views\nallow. For example, a bootstrapping doctor with evidence that he is\nunreliable assembles a sterling track record of success in his\nfirst-order decisions by judging the correctness of his conclusions by\nhis confidence in those conclusions. He thinks the evidence of his\nunreliability that he started out with has now been outweighed, so he\nconcludes that he is reliable after all. EC doesn\u2019t allow this\nto be rational because it doesn\u2019t allow him to assemble the\ntrack record in the first place, since he is obligated in every\ninstance to take into account the expected (un)reliability that he has\nevidence for. It is unclear, however, that EC similarly rules out\nbootstrapping for a subject who begins with no evidence at all about\nher reliability.\n\nThe EC reformulation of GC takes a different view of whether\nrationality requires us to get it right about the first-order support\nrelation or merely to get it right by our own lights, but this\nquestion is of course not specific to the topic of the relation of\nfirst-order and second-order evidence. For example, in a probabilistic\naccount evidential support relations are dictated completely by\nconditional probabilities. In a subjective Bayesian version of this\npicture rationality requires one to have the confidence dictated by\nthe subjective conditional probabilities that follow from one\u2019s\nconfidences in other propositions. In an objective version rationality\nwould obligate one to have a confidence that is in line with the\nobjective conditional probabilities. There are other ways of making\nout subjective vs. objective views of the relevant evidential support\nrelations, and whether we should favor one or the other depends on\nmore general considerations that could provide independent reason to\nfavor one or the other view in the current debate about order\nrelations.\n\nThough this distinction is not specific to the current context it\nappears to have played a role in some authors\u2019 intuitions about\nlevel-splitting above. For example, when Weatherson and Coates say\nthat the subject ought to believe what the first-order evidence\nactually supports because a norm does not cease to apply just because\none has evidence one hasn\u2019t followed it, they assume that the\nrelevant norm and evidential support relation are objective.\nWedgwood\u2019s appeal to externalism about justification also takes\nits bearings from what the first-order evidence actually supports\nrather than what to one\u2019s own point of view it seems to support.\nA challenge for these approaches that achieve some additional\nauthority for first order evidence over the second order by requiring\ndeference to the actual evidential relation at the first order is to\nexplain why this is an obligation at the first order but a subject\nneed only take into account the expected reliability at the\nsecond order.\n",
