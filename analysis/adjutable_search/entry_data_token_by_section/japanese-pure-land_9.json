    "main_text": "Contours of Pure Land Buddhist Thought || Monastic and Lay\n2.5 Monastic and Lay\n\nA third aspect of notable relevance to the Pure Land tradition is the\ntranscendence of the dichotomy of monastic and lay in Mahayana\nthought. Monastic life had developed as the practical norm for\nBuddhist life in the early tradition, for the end was personal\nemancipation from samsaric existence. Practice was construed as\nobservance of the monastic code and meditative practices, and\nwithdrawal from ordinary lay life was itself seen as a crucial step in\nbreaking the bonds of samsaric existence. Mahayanists, however, sought\nto realize a fully nondichotomous wisdom; hence, while in actual\npractice they continued to recognize the efficacy of monastic life as\na means to the goal, renunciation of lay life was not in itself an\nintrinsic or requisite aspect of emancipation. They therefore\nreformulated the central elements of the path\u2014traditionally\ngiven as the \u201cthree learnings\u201d of precepts, meditation,\nand wisdom\u2014as the six paramitas\u2014giving, moral action,\npatience, effort, meditation, and wisdom. In this enumeration of\nvirtues, we find selfless giving understood not simply as alms-giving\nor \u201ccharity,\u201d but as the total, compassionate activity of\nbodhisattvas for whom meritorious action leading to enlightenment and\nthe giving of their own merit to others are interfused. Other\nparamitas also emphasize the resolution to fulfill the bodhisattva\nvows for the enlightenment of all beings. Moreover, precepts or\nmorality was not necessarily construed as the rigid monastic rule\ngoverning sequestered life apart from normal society, but as a more\ngeneral code of proper action observable in varying degrees in lay\nlife also. Thus, true practice and attainment transcends the dualism\nof monk and lay, and the arena of the bodhisattva\u2019s practice is\nprecisely the realm of samsara in which unenlightened beings wander.\nThis insight rooted in Mahayana thought from its beginnings underlies\nthe evolution of Pure Land Buddhism in Japan in particular, which\nduring the period of its most dynamic development evinces precisely\nthe shift of the center of praxis from assumptions of monastic\nefficacy to an emphasis on everyday life as the domain of in which\ngenuine practice is manifested.\n",
