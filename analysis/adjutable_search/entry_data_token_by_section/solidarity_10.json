    "main_text": "Challenges to Solidarity || Theoretical criticism of solidarity\n4.1 Theoretical criticism of solidarity\n\nSince we are here interested in theoretical challenges to\nsolidarity (and not just objections to particular accounts),\nwe focus on challenges that, if true, would undermine the very\nendeavor of elevating solidarity\u2019s place amongst significant\ntheoretical concepts in the discipline.\n4.1.1 Conceptual incoherence\n\nA first theoretical worry about solidarity is that, given the\ndiversity of linguistic usage, the range of contexts of application,\nand the breadth of phenomena addressed in the philosophical literature\nunder the label, solidarity is conceptually incoherent. How might this\nbe the case? To use a somewhat far-fetched example, imagine that we\nwere charged with developing an account of the descriptive features,\ngoodness or permissibility of all human activities that start with the\nletter \u201cL\u201d. Because the actions picked out by our category\nare simply too heterogeneous (there is nothing interesting that\nlaughing and lying, let alone loving and lynching have in common), any\ntheorizing would be pointless. Could it be the case that\n\u201csolidarity\u201d picks out a set of actions and practices that\nare simply too heterogeneous to lead to anything theoretically\ninsightful? Niklas Luhmann, for example, suggested that solidarity is\nobsolete, a mere \u201cformula of ideology\u201d without determinate\ncontent (Luhmann [1984] quoted in Thome 1999: 101).\n\nDespite the initial plausibility of this objection to theorizing\nsolidarity, we think that solidarity theorists have powerful responses\navailable. First, they can point to similarities that unify the\ndescriptive, normative and evaluative features of instantiations of\nsolidarity, even those as diverse as those mentioned above. For\nexample, different authors have sought to show that despite their\ninitial heterogeneity, solidarity in all these contexts descriptively\nentails a form of identification, or a sentiment of unity, or some\norientation towards overcoming an obstacle or adversity, or some\ncombination of these elements (Scholz 2008; Taylor 2015; Prainsack\n& Buyx 2017).  Moreover, authors have subcategorized solidarity\nalong social contexts\u2014political solidarity, civic\nsolidarity\u2014(Bayertz 1999a; Scholz 2008), thereby organizing our\nheterogeneous linguistic use to allow for useful theoretical\napproaches to more determinate social practices of\nsolidarity. Finally, theorists of solidarity can respond that, in\nproviding a theoretical/philosophical account of solidarity, there is\nsome freedom to make revisionary proposals about what should\ncount as solidarity. Our (descriptive, normative, evaluative)\nunderstanding of solidarity is advanced if we \u201csharpen\u201d\nour account of solidarity by excluding some peripheral uses, then that\nmay well be legitimate and will limit the charge of\nincoherence. Theorists of solidarity may also point to other social\nand political concepts to claim that heterogeneous use both in\neveryday discourse and among philosophers is rarely considered a\nconvincing reason to abstain from theorizing concepts like freedom,\nequality, justice, and the like. Why treat solidarity differently?\n4.1.2 Theoretical redundancy\n\nFaced with this appeal to other political concepts, critics may\nretreat to a related but distinct criticism: They may accept that\nconcepts like freedom and equality too are beset with complexity and\nconceptual disagreements that need to be resolved. But they can then\ninsist that there is no need to take up this difficult endeavor for\nsolidarity because\u2014contrary to liberty, equality\netc.\u2014there is no need for a theory of solidarity. This is the\ncharge of theoretical redundancy: we can gain exactly the\nsame explanatory mileage by using existing concepts and categories\nwithout theorizing solidarity. Descriptively, existing work\non altruism, community and relations of loyalty might serve us just as\nwell as accounts of solidarity: all of the relations that were\ndescribed as solidaristic above are also (more or less intimate)\ncommunal relations amongst people. Normatively, the critic\nmight suggest that we can reduce the claims generated by solidarity to\nrequirements of justice, fairness, equality, and the like. And\nevaluatively, we can appeal to the general goodness of\nspecial bonds and relationships for the realization of a flourishing\nlife, whether they are bonds of friendship, family, religion, or\npolitical community. If this were the case, then theorizing solidarity\nwould be redundant, and ultimately, pointless. Why not, in a spirit of\nparsimony, simply rely on the concepts and theories we already\nhave?\n\nAgain, we think that defenders of solidarity have good replies\navailable: Perhaps the strongest response to the challenge of\nredundancy is to provide a substantive account of solidarity in terms\nof its distinctive descriptive, normative and evaluative features. If\nsuch an account is illuminating, then the charge of redundancy seems\nbeside the point. More specifically, theorists of solidarity can\nappeal to distinctive descriptive or positive features of\nsolidarity practices that make it inappropriate to subsume solidarity\nunder a generic account of community and loyalty (see discussion in\nKolers 2016: chapter 2). Unlike those bonds of friendship and family,\nfor example, solidarity is purposive (goal-oriented), both in the\nsense that solidarity aims for the achievement of overcoming some\nobstacle or adversity and in the sense that fellows are picked de\ndicto in terms of the cause that is pursued rather than in some\ngoal-independent manner (Arnsperger & Varoufakis 2003; Kolers\n2016). In terms of normative distinctiveness, theorists of solidarity\nmay also object to the critic\u2019s implied assumption that a\ntheoretical account of x\u2019s normative properties loses its\nusefulness when we discover that these properties supervene on or are\nexplained by a more general moral consideration.\n4.2 Practical challenges to Solidarity\n\nWe now move on to the practical challenges of solidarity. Should we be\ncritical of real-world solidarity practices because they lead to bad\nconsequences? Or may there perhaps even be something constitutively\nproblematic about solidarity movements? Three prominent objections\nrelate to solidarity\u2019s impact on liberty, fairness, and\ntruth.\n4.2.1 Does solidarity threaten liberty?\n\nDoes solidarity muffle liberty? In her celebrated essay the\n\u201cLiberalism of Fear\u201d, Judith Shklar claims it does. She\nwrites:\n\n\nWe must therefore be suspicious of ideologies of solidarity, precisely\nbecause they are so attractive to those who find liberalism\nemotionally unsatisfying, and who have gone on in our century to\ncreate oppressive and cruel regimes of unparalleled horror. [\u2026]\nTo seek emotional and personal development in the bosom of a community\nor in romantic self-expression is a choice open to citizens in liberal\nsocieties. Both, however, are apolitical impulses and wholly\nself-oriented, which at best distract us from the main task of\npolitics when they are presented as political doctrines, and at worst\ncan, under unfortunate circumstances, seriously damage liberal\npractices. For although both appear only to be redrawing the\nboundaries between the personal and the public [\u2026] it cannot be\nsaid that either one has a serious sense of the implications of the\nproposed shifts in either direction. (Shklar 1989: 36)\n\n\nThere is, one might think, an element of truth here: theorists of\nsolidarity tend to emphasize that solidarity becomes important when\nand because we sense the need for collective resistance and unity of\npurpose in the face of adversity. They also stress the\nnon-instrumental value in setting aside self-interest in a horizontal\nidentification with others on behalf of a shared goal, where part of\nwhat is valued is our seeing, together, our collective agency\nreflected in the ends we pursue (see previous section).\n\nThe element of identification may seem particularly problematic.\nIdentification requires, among other things, coming to see others as\n\u201clike oneself\u201d, and taking that similarity as a basis for\njoint concern, empathy, and normative orientation. So, for example,\nwhen I identify with you as a worker, I see our common role\nas providing an important orientation in my life. In this sense,\nsolidarity demands that one set aside the personal for the political\n(thus \u201credrawing the boundaries\u201d between them). The worry\nis that, at least in politics, solidarity\u2019s demand for\nsimilarity, commitment, and loyalty leads to unfreedom and\n tyranny.[11]\n\n\nFaced with this fundamental challenge, theorists of solidarity have at\nleast two arguments: First, they may insist that it is false to treat\na commitment to solidarity as incompatible with a commitment to\nliberalism. To be sure, solidarities organized to promote illiberal\nends by illiberal means are, well, illiberal by definition. But their\ndisregard for individual rights or freedom or equality is not entailed\nor required by their solidarity. Indeed, if, as Shklar and others\nemphasize, liberalism demands vigilance, hatred of injustice, and a\nreadiness to resist power when necessary, then liberalism requires\nsolidarity. Resistance is most effective when it is conducted by\ngroups whose grievances are shared and known to be shared.\nThese grievances provide a spring for joint action, and a powerful\nsource of identification. Such identification is necessary to overcome\nfear, and it allows people to act pro-socially by looking beyond their\nimmediate self-interest to the larger task at hand.\n\nA second reason why these challenges are not fully convincing is this:\nIn Shklar the target is what we might call state-level\nsolidarity. Though they do not name it, their target is national or\npatriotic solidarity\u2014solidarity as invoked by those who have\npolitical power and who aim to rally the people against an enemy, or\nsolidarity as it is invoked by those who believe that active, partisan\npolitical participation is essential for a flourishing life. The first\nresponse is simply to point out (as this entry does) that solidarity\ncan be at the heart of social movements and bottom-up political\naction. It need not be solely focused on or through the state. The\nsecond response is that even state-level solidarity need not be so\npernicious. Civic solidarity need not enforce blind conformity,\ndisrespect difference or disagreement, or raze\n plurality.[12]\n There is a rich tradition in the history of political\nideas\u2014stretching from Leon\n Bourgeois\u2019[13]\n solidarism to present writings\u2014that grounds civic solidarity\nnot in some \u201ctotalizing\u201d pre-political identity, but in\nthe mutual interdependence of citizens and their democratic\nco-authorship of justice-preserving\n institutions.[14]\n\n4.2.2 Does solidarity promote false beliefs?\n\nSolidarity, it was said, imposes not only demands on what to do but\nalso on what fellows should believe. With regard to such beliefs,\nsolidarity requires fellows to see each other as united by some common\nfeature, or condition or experience. Does solidarity systematically\nlead to false beliefs amongst members of solidarity groups, for\nexample about what unites them?\n\nPerhaps most prominently, the question of the relationship\nbetween\u2014in this case, historical\u2014truth and the\nkind of collective group identification necessary for solidarity has\ncome up in debates about (liberal) nationalism. Here, the charge\nagainst nationalist solidarity is that, for essentially instrumental\npurposes, national identity both relies on and promotes false beliefs\namongst members about some glorified national past (Abizadeh 2004).\nOther forms of solidarity need not, of course, rely on some shared\nhistorical origins amongst participants. But the challenge can be\ngeneralized: insofar as solidarity requires some ground for mutual\nidentification, whether shared experience, shared oppression, or\nshared goals, there is a danger that the practice systematically\nguides participants to overestimate those identification-grounding\nfeatures at the expense of other, perhaps more salient, elements that\nare not shared amongst them. To go back to two earlier examples,\nsisterhood may require participants to see some feature of their\nidentity (\u201cbeing a woman\u201d) as particularly important when,\nin fact, their de facto situation of social disadvantage is (also)\nfundamentally structured by other categories like race or class.\nSimilarly, black solidarity asks participants to focus on whatever\ngrounds commonality amongst blacks, even if their actual social\nposition is shaped by matters of class, gender, migration status, and\nso on (Shelby forthcoming). \n\nConfronted with the fact that much of what is promulgated as part of\nshared national history does not hold up against the historical\nrecord, liberal nationalists like David Miller (1995) have responded\nthat \u201cmyths\u201d about a national collective\u2019s past need\nnot be true so long as they serve the purpose of supporting those\nattitudes that underpin valuable national solidarity. But irrespective\nof whether or not they are useful, they are untrue,\nand, to the extent that the group identification necessary for\nnational solidarity depends on it, it depends on having false\nbeliefs.\n\nDoes this worry generalize to all forms of solidarity? One important\ndifference between national solidarity and other forms is that most\nother solidarities do not typically depend on beliefs in something\nthat is manifestly untrue. Rather, they emphasize the relevance of\nsome genuine aspect of a person\u2019s practical\nidentity\u2014whether it is shared experience, shared oppression,\nshared goals etc.\u2014over others. We might add that whether or not\nsome feature is salient for one\u2019s practical identity\nis, at least to a degree, up to the relevant agent. So one\nconciliatory response that defenders of (non-national) solidarity\nmight offer is that solidarity does not depend on belief in\nfalsehoods, but rather that it expresses which aspects of their\nidentity participants take to be important. They might add that,\ninsofar as there is free deliberation both about what unites and,\nimportantly, what divides participants to solidarity movements, the\ncharge of promoting false beliefs is beside the point. In a more\ncombative vein, they may also add that, at least in some cases,\nsolidarity is actually a necessary element for the formation of\ncorrect beliefs about one\u2019s own and others\u2019 predicament.\nWiland describes this as epistemic solidarity (Wiland 2017:\n69). Thus, standing in solidarity with others that have suffered from\nsimilar instances of adversity and oppression can be a necessary\ncondition for enabling each other to make sense of our predicament: We\nform true beliefs about our shared predicament and improve our ability\nto define and fight oppressive conditions by being able to trust each\nother\u2019s oppression-related testimony (Goodin & Spiekermann\n2015).\n4.2.3 Is solidarity exclusionary / unfair towards outsiders?\n\nWhatever else solidarity entails descriptively; it entails a special\ncommitment to one\u2019s solidarity fellows that one does not hold\ntowards everybody else. And whatever normative consequences solidarity\nhas for those in solidarity, it will ground some special\nclaims that these fellows have on us and we on them. In this sense,\nsolidarity, like friendship, family, and nationality, constitutes a\nspecial relationship with special obligations. Over recent decades, a\nnumber of philosophers have raised challenges to the very idea that\nspecial obligations can be justified towards those who are not part of\nthem. Perhaps most prominently, Samuel Scheffler has raised a\nfairness-based \u201cdistributive objection\u201d to all special\nrelationships (Scheffler 2001). If fellows in solidarity form special\nrelationships with special obligations, then, does Scheffler\u2019s\ncriticism apply here too?\n\nThe distributive objection builds on the idea that participants to\nspecial relationships receive special benefits from each other: qua\nmembership, we are owed not just more from fellow participants than we\nare from outsiders, but we are also owed priority, in at least some\ninstances. What the distributive objection observes is that members\nalready benefit from the relationship goods that are constitutively\ntied to being in a meaningful relationship. The problem is that, then,\nfellows also owe less to outsiders then they did beforehand: Special\nrelationships\u2014including solidarity relations\u2014thus\nfunction, to use Scheffler\u2019s memorable phrase, like \u201cmoral\ntax shelters\u201d to those who already benefit.\n\nWhilst several authors have rejected the general thrust of the\ndistributive objection (Kolodny 2002; Lazar 2009), we want to point to\nsome features of solidarity that should provide specific cover against\nthis challenge. Crucially, friends of solidarity may stress that\nunlike friendship or love relations, solidarity obligations are not\nnecessarily grounded in the value of the relationship, but in\nrelationship-independent value that comes from having these duties.\nSpecial duties of solidarity would then be justified more like role\nobligations\u2014lawyers, for example, have fiduciary duties to\nrepresent their client\u2019s interests not because of the\nnon-instrumental value of lawyer-client relationships, but because of\nthe advantages that vesting them with such duties has for the\nsystem\u2019s overall ability to optimally realize impartial moral\ndemands (such as protecting innocent defendants). On this strategy,\nduties of solidarity would ultimately be grounded in non-partial\nvalues like fairness and natural justice. How might this justification\nrun? Many of our positive general duties are imperfect, so that even\nwell-meaning people are likely to face significant obstacles in\ndischarging them: it requires the ability to coordinate our actions in\ncomplex ways with others; and we must also be motivated to make\ncontributions in light of other important projects and relationships.\nIf the special obligations that flow from solidarity commitments can\nprovide us with a robust way of solving issues of coordination and\nmotivation (because, following a solidarity-commitment, discharging\nour general duties through solidarity somehow better aligns with our\npersonal projects) then those obligations could be justified by an\nappeal to impartial moral considerations (Kolers 2016; Viehoff\nforthcoming).\n\nBut even for those who think that some duties of solidarity\nare grounded in the non-instrumental value of solidaristic fellowship,\nthere are important responses available: First, solidarity (at least\nin its most paradigmatic forms) establishes unity amongst those\nsuffering from injustice or oppression, so it rather far from\nproviding some kind of indirect protection from more extensive duties\ntowards the more vulnerable. Second, special responsibilities towards\nour fellows, like other special duties, are not absolute: very\nplausibly, they are constrained by general demands of justice. So even\nif special obligations among fellows in solidarity could ground some\npartiality, these duties would be limited by more weighty\nconsiderations of justice.\n\nDo these responses answer all the possible objections of fairness and\nexclusion? Probably not; questions of permissible solidaristic\npartiality, especially amongst large-scale collectives like the state,\nclearly depend on questions of social and global justice that cannot\nbe addressed here. So questions of the kinds of obligations that\nsolidarity practices can ground blend into issues of justice. But that\nshould not be surprising, nor should it prevent us from reflection on\nsolidarity in its own right.",
