When we are aware of\nhaving a thought, can we doubt that we are having that thought?\nConsciousness involves reflection. Is\nconsciousness essentially constituted by a perception distinct from\nthe original perception? Does consciousness necessarily involve memory\nor reflection? Is all consciousness a form of\nself-consciousness?\nConscious thought is intentional. Are\nall thoughts representational? What is the nature of intentionality\nand what is its relation to consciousness?\n\n\nEach of these three sets of questions were taken up and developed in\ndifferent directions by the philosophers that followed Descartes most\nclosely. The Cartesians, as they are called, were divided on each of\nthese issues, and these sets of questions continue with us in one form\nor another to this day.\n2.2.1 Transparency\n\nMany Cartesians followed Descartes in defining thought in terms of\nconsciousness. Louis de la Forge, who systematized Descartes\u2019s\naccount of the mind, defined thought in this way:\n\n\nThought [is] that perception, consciousness [conscience], or\ninner knowledge which each one of us experiences directly in ourselves\nwhen we are aware of [s\u2019aper\u00e7evoir de] what we\ndo or of what takes place in ourselves. (La Forge 39)\n\n\nAnd later,\n\n\n[T]he nature of thought consists [in] that consciousness\n[conscience], testimony [t\u00e9moignage] and\ninner sensation [sentiment interieur] by which the mind is\naware [averti] of everything it does or suffers and, in\ngeneral, of everything which takes place immediately in itself at the\nsame time as it acts or is acted on. (La Forge 57, translation\naltered)\n\n\nNote that here La Forge elaborates on Descartes\u2019s definition. He\ntreats these terms as equivalent: perception, consciousness,\ntestimony, inner sensation. Descartes does not describe consciousness\nin terms of sentiment, and this addition raises important\nquestions\u2014is consciousness simply a kind of sensation? Is it to\ninterior perception what our senses of sight, sound, taste, etc. are\nto the perception of external things? Or is it different in kind?\n\nMalebranche follows La Forge in this identification. In The Search\nafter Truth, Malebranche uses \u201cconsciousness\u201d\n(conscience) and \u201cinner sensation\u201d (sentiment\ninterieur) interchangeably. (See, for example, Book III, Part 2,\nChapter 7, Search 236\u2013239.) Later, he defines thought\nin a way that closely models La Forge\u2019s definition: \n\n\n[B]y the words thought, mode of thinking, or\nmodification of the soul, I generally understand all those\nthings that cannot be in the soul without the soul being aware of them\nthrough the inner sensation it has of itself. (Search\n218)\n\n\n(Schmaltz argues that Malebranche was strongly influenced by La Forge\nin his argument here. See Schmaltz 1996, 16ff.) \n\nThus, La Forge and Malebranche continue Descartes\u2019s commitment\nto transparency. However, the shift to \u201cinterior sense\u201d is\nan important shift, since it marks a shift in the content of\nwhat is transparent to the mind, especially concerning the\nmind\u2019s own nature. Malebranche famously denied Descartes\u2019s\nclaim that the mind is better known than the body. This is due to the\nfact that, although we know body confusedly through our sensations of\nthe external world, we nevertheless have knowledge of the nature of\nbody. (I\u2019ll leave aside Malebranche\u2019s complicated story of\nhow we come to have that knowledge.) But, in the case of the mind, all\nwe have is the internal sense of the mind\u2014we do not know the\nnature of the mind since we have no such concept. Malebranche\nsays:\n\n\nIt is true that we know well enough through our consciousness, or the\ninner sensation that we have of ourselves, that our soul is something\nof importance. But what we know of it might be almost nothing compared\nto what it is in itself. (Search 238)\n\n\nHe later gives an explanation of why we have knowledge of bodies\nthrough the ideas of bodies, but not so for the soul:\n\n\nThe knowledge that we have of our soul through consciousness is\nimperfect, granted; but it is not false. On the other hand, that\nknowledge that we have of bodies through sensation or consciousness,\nif the confused sensation we have of what takes place in our body can\nbe called consciousness, is not only imperfect, but also false. We\ntherefore need an idea of the body to correct our sensations of\nit\u2014but we need no idea of our soul, since our consciousness of\nit does not involve us in error\u2026. (Search 239)\n\n\nThus, consciousness, as internal sensation, gives us\nimperfect knowledge of the soul, but it is knowledge that is\nsufficient for all practical (and, importantly for Malebranche,\ntheological) purposes. \n\nSo, the subtle shift in the meaning of consciousness to\n\u201cinternal sensation\u201d places some limits on what can be\nknown about the mind by means of consciousness. One can be aware\nthat one is thinking, but this does not give us a clear idea\nof the soul. It is not self-knowledge of the same sort. But\nnote also the other shift that this entails\u2014marked by\nMalebranche\u2019s qualification in the passage above. The sensation\nof external objects may not be (properly speaking) consciousness.\nConsciousness is an interior phenomenon, a sensation of what\nis going on in us, and so the visual perception of a red ball\ncan be called consciousness only in a derivative way. This leads us to\nquestions about reflection, taken up in the next thread.\n2.2.2 Reflection\n\nAs discussed above, already in the Seventh Objections to the\nMeditations, the objection was raised that consciousness\nappears to require a distinct reflective thought. Descartes denied the\ninference, saying that\n\n\n[T]he initial thought by means of which we become aware of something\ndoes not differ from the second thought by means of which we become\naware that we were aware of it, any more than this second thought\ndiffers from the third thought by means of which we become aware that\nwe were aware that we were aware. (CSM II 382 / AT VII 559)\n\n\nAgain, as noted above, Descartes\u2019s response here is not a denial\nthat reflection is necessary for consciousness\u2014he denies that\nreflection requires a distinct thought. La Forge and\nMalebranche both follow Descartes in this denial (see Schmaltz 1996,\n18).\n\nBut this passage is somewhat ambiguous. Here Descartes distinguishes\n(1) becoming aware of something, which apparently requires only a\nsingle thought, from (2) becoming aware that we were aware of\nsomething. Apparently, first-order awareness does not require a\nreflective act. And, while becoming aware that we were aware\nof something does require a reflective act, it does not require a\ndistinct thought (and so the threatening regress is not problematic).\nBut it\u2019s not at all clear from this passage how the reflection\ncould be built in to the original thought, especially since there\nappears to be a shift in tenses (the second awareness is temporally\nposterior to the initial awareness).\n\nAntoine Arnauld develops an account of reflection that incorporates\nthis distinction. The reflection that is essential to any thought does\nnot involve a second order perception. As noted above, Arnauld argued\nthat each thought has reflection built into it, although this\ndoes not entail a second-order thought. Only explicit\nreflection, where an individual focuses their attention on their own\nthoughts, requires a second-order perception. (For more on\nArnauld\u2019s account, see Nadler 1989, 118\u201322.)\n\nAs Genevi\u00e8ve Lewis shows, this issue became a critical source\nof debate in the later seventeenth century. She notes that\nPierre-Silvain R\u00e9gis, in his defense of Cartesianism, commits\nhimself to some sort of reflective knowledge as a constitutive part of\nconsciousness. R\u00e9gis, like Arnauld, reaches all the way back to\nAugustine as a source for this doctrine, quoting Augustine\u2019s\nclaim that \u201cit is necessary that [an animal] perceives\n(sentio) that it does see when it sees\u201d (Augustine 37,\nquoted by R\u00e9gis, Syst\u00e8me I, 150) When conscious\nof something, one \u201cperceives that one perceives it.\u201d This\nway of putting it was actually quite common as a way of describing the\npsychological sense of consciousness\u2014one not only sees\na red ball, but one also perceives that one perceives the red\nball. This sounds for all the world like a reflective act.\n\nOn the basis of this, one of the chief opponents to Cartesianism,\nPierre Daniel Huet, argues that the Cartesians are begging the\nquestion. He argues,\n\n\nEvery thought involves three things: the thinking mind, the thing\nplaced before the thinking mind [i.e., the object of\nthought], and the action of the thinking mind on the thing placed\nbefore it. (Huet 82)\n\n\nDescartes, Huet contends, fails to distinguish these three things in\nthe cogito argument. When Descartes says ego cogito,\nI am thinking, what is the object of thought? His own thought itself.\nBut, and here is the objection, this cannot be the same\nthought as the original thought, \u201cfor if it were, the\naction would be turned back upon itself, which is absurd and contrary\nto the natural light so often invoked by Descartes\u201d (83).\nNevertheless, this is the very response Descartes gives in his\nresponse to Bourdin. Why does Huet think this is \u201cabsurd and\ncontrary\u201d?\n\nHuet goes on:\n\n\n[I]n order for me to think that I am thinking, two thoughts are\nneeded, with one reflecting on the other\u2014the later, current one\non the previous, earlier one\u2014so that in order for the first\nthought, by which the mind is aware, to be placed before the mind, the\nsecond thought, by which the mind is aware, is of the first thought.\nOr, in short, the first thought will be the end or object of the\nsecond; the second will be the action of the mind whereby it is\ndirected to the first thought. But it is a contradiction that both\nshould occur by a single action\u2026 (84)\n\n\nIn his reply, R\u00e9gis argues that this is precisely what is going\non. He argues that we have no need for distinct reflective ideas;\nDescartes \u201cperceives that he thinks by a single and simple idea,\nwhich is known through itself\u201d (R\u00e9ponse 35; cf.\nSyst\u00e8me I, 150). And then he argues that if a second\nact were necessary then an infinite regress would threaten, since in\norder to be aware of the second thought one would need a third, and so\n on.[4]\n Huet sidesteps this objection with a response drawn from Aquinas:\n\u201che [Aquinas] admits that thoughts will be multiplied ad\ninfinitum and that the mind is infinite\u2014not in act, but in\npotency\u201d (Huet 86).\n\nBut underlying all of this is a further, important, difference between\nHuet and the Cartesians. Huet argues that\n\n\nThis expression [i.e., \u201cego cogito\u201d] is\ndefective, for it should be taken to mean, and to be worth as much as\nif I were to say, \u2018I am thinking that I was thinking.\u2019 For\nlike the eyes, the human mind can attend to only one thing at a time.\nThus, in order for me to think that I am thinking, two thoughts are\nneeded\u2026. (84)\n\n\nIf Huet\u2019s phrase \u201cthe human mind can attend to only one\nthing at a time\u201d means that a we can think of only one thing at\na time, then the Cartesians will reject this premise. Indeed,\nDescartes explicitly does so (see CSM III 335 / AT V 149). But\nR\u00e9gis responds by rejecting the premise that the eye sees only\none thing at a time, reinforcing the analogy between the mind and the\neye. He argues that if thought is to the mind as light is to the eye,\nthen when we see something, there are three distinct aspects of the\nevent: \u201cthe eye that sees, the action by which it sees, and the\nobject seen\u201d (R\u00e9ponse 35). Suppose now that we\nsay, \u201cI see the light.\u201d Must we suppose that there must be\na second light illuminating first? No; we see the light by\nitself. Similarly for thought\u2014if Huet grants the analogy,\nhe \u201cmust conclude that [a thought] is known through\nitself\u201d (R\u00e9ponse 36).\n\nThe result is that, for the Cartesians, a thought can\n\u201cturn back upon itself,\u201d which is what Huet finds absurd.\nHuet\u2019s objection is that the Cartesians are illicitly smuggling\nin the subject as an object of all thoughts. If so,\nhe argues, then this requires a second thought, which undermines the\ncogito argument.\n\nAnd so one of the crucial points of clarification for a\ntheory of consciousness is getting straight on whether\nconsciousness involves reflection, and, if so, whether that requires a\ndistinct reflective thought.\n2.2.3 Intentionality\n\nThese considerations of incorrigibility and reflection have\nimplications for the intentionality of thought. Antoine Dilly, another\nCartesian philosopher of the seventeenth century, will bring out some\nof these points. In response to an argument by Ignace Gaston Pardies\nin which Pardies defends a certain kind of knowledge in animals, Dilly\ndefends the Cartesian position. He writes (in 1676):\n\n\nTo avoid falling into an equivocation concerning the word\nreflection, it is good to recognize that [a] we can sometimes\nreflect on what we do and [b] sometimes the first thought that we have\nis not only perceived, but when a second thought takes the first for\nits object it happens that we know its nature much better by this\nrepeated inspection. This is even more so since the first thought\nprincipally renders its object present to the soul and by being sensed\ninforms us of its [i.e., the thought\u2019s] presence. But this\nsecond thought has as its object only the first; it shows it to us as\nlively as the first shows us its object. Thus it should not be\nbelieved that each thought is followed by a second that makes it\nknown, because the latter would have to have a third, and so on to\ninfinity. But we are assured, being convinced by our own experience,\nthat all thought is made sensible to the soul, not by any veritable\nreturn on itself, but directly and immediately merely by its presence:\nthus when I see, my vision makes sensible what is, without having need\nfor any other thing. Each person can be much better convinced of this\nby consulting themselves\u2026. (Dilly 116\u2013118)\n\n\nThere are two noteworthy elements here. First, Dilly repeats the\narguments we saw in R\u00e9gis, advancing the view that thoughts are\nknown through themselves rather than requiring a distinct reflective\nthought. Second, Dilly nevertheless characterizes our perception in\nterms of reflection in order to preserve a sense in which the original\nperception \u201cinforms us\u201d of its presence (i.e., the\npresence of the idea), by means of which we are aware of the object of\nthought. This is the sort of awareness that Descartes and the\nCartesians have been working to preserve.\n\nDilly is developing this thought with an eye to dismissing what\nPardies describes as \u201ccorporeal knowledge.\u201d As Dilly\nunderstands this, Pardies is saying that an animal can\nperceive something without perceiving that it\nperceives, contrary to the Augustinian slogan mentioned above.\nThat is to say, there may be a representation of the object\nin the animal, but the animal is unaware of the object. Dilly\nresponds: \n\n\nIs it conceivable that [a dog] is led to run to his master by a\ngenuine knowledge that he has of him, without knowing that he\nperceives his master\u2026? How could he identify this man from a\nhundred others that resemble him without perceiving that he sees him\nand is assured, from the inside, that it is him and not some other\nthat he needs to go to for petting? And how does he do all of this\nwithout knowing that he does it? (122)\n\n\nUnderlying Dilly\u2019s rhetorical questions about the dog in need of\na good petting is a thesis about intentionality. According to Dilly,\nany attempt to demonstrate that animals have thought must consider how\nthe thought would enter into the passions and actions that the animal\nis experiencing. It is not enough simply to develop an account of\nperception by which the things around the animal are\nimpressed upon it. \n\nThe implicit argument here is that there is no genuine\nrepresentation if there is no awareness of the\nrepresentation. Whatever a dog qua machine is acting on when\nrunning to his master, it is not an internal representation of his\nmaster that the dog acts on with purpose. The \u201ccorporeal\nknowledge\u201d would be nothing but connections or impressions of\none body on another\u2014without an awareness of these\nimpressions and what they represent, they won\u2019t serve the\npurposes of knowledge, sensation, action, or volition.\n\nDilly argues that intentionality requires awareness\u2014a thought\ndoes not represent an object unless there is a subject that is aware\nof the representation. And so the consciousness of a thought is\nconceptually prior to its intentionality, which is to say that\nintentionality is simply a kind of\n consciousness.[5]\n But, as we will see, others will argue in the reverse direction.\nIndeed, if a conscious thought is a representation of something\nplus a reflective act, then it seems that the representation\nis conceptually prior to consciousness. What is being worked out\nduring this period is what, exactly, the relation of consciousness,\nrepresentation, and thought really is. And this is something of\nenduring\n interest.[6]\n\n",
