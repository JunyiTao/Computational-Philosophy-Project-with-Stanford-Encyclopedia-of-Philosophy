    "main_text": "Theories || Discussions and Contributions from the Historicist View\n4.2 Discussions and Contributions from the Historicist View\n\nOne kind of general criticism to the classical view came mainly from\nscholars interested in history of science, once referred to as new\nphilosophers, such as Thomas S. Kuhn (1962 [1970]) and Imre\nLakatos (1970). The majority of diachronic studies and analyses\ntypical of these authors is supposed to be closer to scientific\npractice as history presents it to us. Besides, underlying them is a\nnew conception of the nature and synchronic structure of scientific\ntheories. The point is often merely implied and is not always\nsystematically developed, and in\n Section 5\n we will refer to the more general problem of the relations between\nsynchronic and diachronic studies and between philosophy and history\nof science/biology. These historicist philosophers of science conceive\nthis new notion of theory in different ways, referring to them by\ndifferent terms, e.g., paradigm or disciplinary\nmatrix in Kuhn (1962 [1970\\) and scientific research\nprogram in Lakatos (1970).\n\nAs Kuhn (1970) recognizes, he had been using the term\n\u201cparadigm\u201d in 1962 in two different though related senses:\n(1) as the global set of commitments shared by the members of a given\nscientific community, which he later called the disciplinary\nmatrix and which contains exemplars as one of its components; and\n(2) as concrete solutions to problems, which he then called\nexemplars.\n\nAs for the application of Kuhnian views to the field of biology, we\nhave not identified a systematic use or application of the notion of\nparadigm as disciplinary matrix in the analysis of particular cases\npertaining to the field of biology. A notable exception in the field\nof biochemistry is the analysis made by C\u00e9sar Lorenzano (1994),\nafter coming into contact with the philosopher C. Ulises Moulines, a\ndisciple of the German philosopher Wolfgang Stegm\u00fcller and one\nthe main figures of the structuralist view of theories (Sneed 1971\n[1979]; Stegm\u00fcller 1973; Balzer, Moulines, & Sneed 1987), who\nlived in Mexico from 1976 to 1984. Lorenzano developed his own\n\u201cstructuralized\u201d, though informal, version of Kuhn\u2019s\nconceptions: a Kuhnian perspective passed through the sieve of a\nversion of the semantic view to which we will refer later.\n\nThe sense of paradigm that philosophers of biology have found most\nfruitful in carrying out their analyses is that of the\nexemplar, either arguing that the theories of the biological\nand/or biomedical sciences possess a particular structure distinct\nfrom that of physical theories (Schaffner 1980, 1986; Darden 1991) or\nconsidering that this is not the case, if they are analyzed within the\nframework of some version of the semantic view of theories (Schaffner\n1993). Argentine philosopher and historian of science Pablo Lorenzano,\nwho first studied in Mexico with his father, C\u00e9sar, and with C.\nUlises Moulines, then with the latter and Wolfgang Balzer in Germany,\nargues along the same lines as Schaffner (1993). However, he also\nmaintains that the theories of the biological and/or biomedical\nsciences can be analyzed without developing a new variant of the\nsemantic view of theories. Instead this can be plausibly carried out\nusing the structuralist version of the semantic view of theories (P.\nLorenzano 2007a, 2012).\n\nAlthough it has not been central to the field, the Lakatosian\nperspective has not been entirely absent from analysis in biology.\nHowever, there are only a few analyses that systematically use\nLakatos\u2019s concept of a scientific research program, that is,\nthat clearly identify the components of such a program, including its\nirrefutable hard core, its protective belt, and its (negative and\npositive) heuristics. Nevertheless, we find some examples in Latin\nAmerica where these components are clearly identified. For instance,\nanalyses carried out by Argentine philosopher Juan Manuel Torres\n(1996) on the competing research programs on the origin of life, the\nOparin-Fox \u201cphenotype program\u201d, and the Muller-Haldane\n\u201cgenotype program\u201d; those made by the Argentine\nphilosopher and historian H\u00e9ctor A. Palma and biologist,\nscience teacher, and communicator Eduardo Wolovelsky (Palma &\nWolovelsky 1997) on Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection; those\nconducted by Brazilian biologists and philosophers Nei F. Nunes-Neto,\nRicardo Santos do Carmo, and Charbel N. El-Hani (2009) on\nLovelock\u2019s Gaia hypothesis; and those performed by Argentine\nhelminthologist and philosopher Guillermo Denegri (2008; Cabaret &\nDenegri 2008) in parasitology. The latter, together with Argentine\nphilosopher Gisela Lamas and Argentine biologist Vicente Dressino,\nalso use Lakatos\u2019 approach, modifying it by substituting the\nnotion of hard core for that of conservative nucleus, the difference\nbeing that the latter allows slight changes with regards to the\ninitial proposal in the course of its development, focusing on the\nstudy of the facial component in mammals (Dressino, Denegri, &\nLamas 1998). In turn, Pablo Lorenzano (2013d) also uses the Lakatosian\nnotions of hard core, protective belt, and positive and negative\nheuristics to analyze the first research program in genetics,\nBateson\u2019s Mendelism. However, he more precisely applies\nLakatosian analysis through use of the structuralist concepts of\nfundamental law/guiding principle, specializations, and the way of\nobtaining and testing specializations (see\n Section 4.3\n below), which explicate the notions of hard core, protective belt,\nand positive and negative heuristics, respectively.\n",
