    "main_text": "Philosophical Method || Newtonianism and Empiricism\n1.2 Newtonianism and Empiricism\n\n\nThe relations between one's first principles, the perceived\naims\u2014and limits\u2014of natural philosophy, and one's religious\nbackground came together in eighteenth-century Great Britain to issue\nin a number of different philosophical stances. Typically these\nstances are framed as various commitments to Newton and\nNewtonianism. Hume and MacLaurin believe the mind's\noperations are to be studied with broadly observational Newtonian\nmethods, though this leads them to forms of local\nskepticism. Priestley and Hartley apply Newtonianism not only to the\noperations of the mind but to the mind's substance via\nmaterialist commitments. Reid's teacher George Turnbull adopted\nNewtonianism and was led to Berkeleyan idealism by many of Berkeley's\nown common-sense commitments. Wanting both the world and knowledge of\nit in his philosophical system, Reid was at pains to articulate his\naccount of both common sense and Newtonianism. Unlike most British\nEmpiricists, Reid read, understood, and taught Newton's writings. To\nunderstand Reid's philosophical method, not to mention his philosophy\nof science, one must understand core features of Reid's Newtonianism\n(Callerg\u00e5rd, 2010) and, perhaps, how Reid altered Newton's own\nmethod (Ducheyne 2006).\n\n\nFirst, Reid is committed to the positive role of mathematics in\nstating and testing theories. Only in that field do we \u201cfind no\nsects, no contrary systems, and hardly any disputes\u201d (EIP 6.4,\n457). Newton's greatness lies in part due to the fact that he places\nphysics upon firm mathematical ground, in sharp contrast to Cartesian\nphysics, its leading competitor of the time.  Second, Reid says that\nissues about causation are not issues physics should attempt to\nresolve. This counterintuitive commitment is explained by the fact\nthat Reid believes causes, when that term is used properly,\nare efficient causes (The Correspondence of Thomas\nReid, abbreviated \u2018Correspondence\u2019 below, 2006,\n158). Not only this, efficient causes are only ever agents (EAP 1.5,\n30\u201332; for more about this, see 4. Causation and\nFree Will, below). Reid attributes this position to Newton. Reid\nmentions on many occasions, and with a certain pride, that Newtonian\nscience does not permit knowledge of causes of phenomena, for example,\nthe motion of the compass needle or the attraction of two bodies. Here\nand elsewhere Reid frequently speaks with the scientists and uses\n\u2018cause\u2019 in a colloquial way to refer to physical causes; in doing so,\nhe explicitly follows David Hume's lead. More often, however, Reid\nurges readers to think of scientific explanation in terms of laws, as\nNewton had done. Laws are true general propositions used to explain\nappearances (Thomas Reid on the Animate Creation 1996,\n187). Physics does not aim to find efficient causes. By dispensing\nwith causes and amplifying the explanatory value and empirical\njustification of statements of laws, Reid's account is regarded as a\nforerunner to a deductive-nomological model of explanation.\n\n\nThird, related, when one event produces another event, e.g. fertilizer\nenables better plant growth, Reid strongly resists describing that\ninteraction as necessary (The Correspondence of Thomas\nReid 2006, 234, 243). One event may be constantly conjoined to\nanother event, but it is a mistake to believe that this forms any\nnecessity. Fourth, unlike nearly all other Early Modern philosophers\ntraditionally taught in the canon, Reid was an avowed experimentalist,\nmade so by borrowing Newton's methods in Opticks, and\nconducted experiments to provide evidence for his claims about the\nnature of the mind, perception and agency. Reid was active in his\ncommunity, bringing his penchant for knowledge through experimentation\nto meetings in Aberdeenshire in which experimental techniques in\nfarming were debated. Fifth, Reid understands Newtonian physics to\noffer partial confirmation to some beliefs about God and God's\nrelation to the world. Newtonian natural science's role in this\nconnection is to provide evidence for belief that our solar system is\norderly and well-governed. (See 8. Philosophy of\nReligion below).\n\n\nStating central features of Reid's commitment to Newtonianism goes a\nlong way to understanding Reid's empiricism and science since Reid\nattributes most of his own views about these matters to\nNewton. Despite the fact that with a few notable exceptions Reid\nscholars have neglected issues in his philosophy of science, a few key\ncontroversies have emerged and merit brief mention. First, Reid was\nembroiled in clashes with other thinkers and correspondents about the\nscope of Newton's Regulae Philosophandi. Interpretations\ndiffered considerably, as did the translations and restatements of the\nrules themselves. Given that after Bacon's work,\nNewton's Regulae formed the most important statement on\nmethod in natural philosophy to be found in the Early Modern period,\nReid was quick to defend his interpretation of these rules against\nalternate uses by Priestley and others.\n\n\nReid translates Newton's first rule from Latin as \u201cNo more\ncauses, nor any other causes of natural effects ought to be admitted,\nbut such as are both true, and are sufficient for explaining their\nappearances\u201d and adds in his own voice, \u201cThis is a golden\nrule; it is the true and proper test, by which what is sound and solid\nin philosophy may be distinguished from what is hollow and vain\u201d\n(EIP 1.3, 51). Reid expands the intended scope of this rule saying\nthat it is a \u201cfundamental principle in our enquiries into the\nstructure of the mind, and its operations\u201d (EIP 1.3,\n51). Occurring in the introductory portion of his Essays on\nIntellectual Powers, he would go on to use and reuse it countless\ntimes in what followed. He also describes Newton's first rule as\n\u201ca dictate of common sense\u201d (EIP 2.6, 102). Proponents of\nthe Way of Ideas fail to abide by Newton's first rule when they\nendorse the existence of ideas because the existence of ideas is an\nhypothesis and lacks evidence.\n\n \nAnother area of controversy in Reid's empiricism involves the\ngrounding of his belief to the effect that ether does not exist. Ether\nappears to represent just the sort of posit (originally by Descartes\nin Principles of Philosophy) that Newtonians often enjoyed\nsweeping into the trash. Lacking any observational evidence for ether,\nDescartes posits ether as a medium through which forces can act on\nbodies that are not in direct contact. But does Reid reject ether\ntheory on the grounds that it is unobservable and therefore\ndoes not belong in a Newtonian science, or does he reject ether\ntheory because scientists as yet lack justificatory observations\non its behalf? Reid's apparent hostility to\n\u201chypotheses\u201d in philosophy and \u201cefficient\ncauses\u201d in natural philosophy gives rise to the belief that Reid\ndoes not believe that forces should be allowed into philosophy. The\nanswer to this question can resolve that issue and assist in locating\nReid's philosophy of science on the positivist/realist spectrum.\n\n\nThe first rule does not entail that unobservables like ether, subtile\nfluids, or forces do not or cannot have explanatory force, let alone\nthat unobservables do not exist. Reid is explicit that questions about\nthe existence of ether were open questions that were not settled by a\npriori (EIP 2.3, 82). Physical forces and causes do exist and may\nyield their secrets to science in the form of purely physical forces\nof attraction (An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of\nCommon Sense, abbreviated to \u2018IHM\u2019, 7, 211). This has two\ncorollaries of considerable importance for understanding Reid's\nmethods. First, the fact that Reid admits that these forces of\nattraction\u2014unobservable, immaterial forces\u2014may be physical\nimplies that he is comfortable with a physical explanation of\ngravitation that does not entail the existence of God. Second,\nphysical forces will not yield their secrets to an impoverished\nCartesian science. This criticism is made on the grounds that\nCartesians were attempting to understand gravitational attraction in\nterms of only extension, figure and motion\u2014for Reid, a\ncatastrophic mistake. In fact, Reid's criticism of the Cartesians has\nprovided a clue for an account of Reidian forces as irreducible\nproperties of matter (Callerg\u00e5rd 2005, 2010).\n",
