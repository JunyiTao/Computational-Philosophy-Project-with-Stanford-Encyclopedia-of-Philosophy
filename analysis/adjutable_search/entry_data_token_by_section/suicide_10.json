    "main_text": "The Morality and Rationality of Suicide || Suicide as a Moral Duty?\n3.6 Suicide as a Moral Duty?\n\nTo this point, we have addressed arguments that concern whether a\nmoral permission to engage in suicidal behavior exists, and\nindeed, it is this question that has dominated ethical discussion of\nsuicide. Yet the social arguments against suicide are fundamentally\nconsequentialist, and some act-utilitarians have discussed the\ncorrelative possibility that the good consequences of suicide might so\noutweigh its bad consequences as to render suicide admirable or even\nmorally obligatory (Cosculluela 1995, 76\u201381). In fact,\nin some cases, suicide may be honorable. Suicides that are clearly\nother-regarding, aiming at protecting the lives or well-being of\nothers, or at political protest, may fall into this category (Kupfer\n1990, 73\u201374). Examples of this might include the grenade-jumping\nsoldier mentioned earlier, or the spy who takes his life in order not\nto be subjected to torture that will lead to his revealing vital\nmilitary secrets. Utilitarians have given particular attention to the\nquestion of end-of-life euthanasia, suggesting that at the very least,\nthose with painful terminal illnesses have a right to voluntary\neuthanasia (Glover 1990, chs. 14\u201315, Singer 1993, ch. 7). Yet\nutilitarian views hold that we have a moral duty to maximize\nhappiness, from which it follows that when an act of suicide will\nproduce more happiness than will remaining alive, then that suicide is\nnot only morally permitted, but morally required.\n\nHowever, the thesis that there may exist a \u201cduty to die\u201d\nneed not be defended by appeal to overtly consequentialist or\nutilitarian reasoning. In the course of articulating what he terms a\n\u201cfamily-centered\u201d approach to bioethics, the philosopher\nJohn Hardwig (1996, 1997) has argued that sometimes the burdens that a\nperson imposes on others, particularly on family members or loved\nones, by continuing to live are sufficiently great that one may have a\nduty to die in order to relieve them of these burdens. Hardwig\u2019s\nargument thus seems to turn not on the overall balance of costs and\nbenefits that result from a person living or dying, but on the\nfairness of the burdens that a person imposes on others by continuing\nto live.\n\nWhile generally acknowledging Hardwig\u2019s suggestion that duties\nto others have been neglected in discussion of the ethics of suicide,\ncritics of morally required suicide raise a number of objections to\nhis proposal. (See Hardwig et al. 2000, Humber & Almeder 2000.)\nSome doubt that the duty of beneficence to which Hardwig appeals\njustifies anything stronger than a permission to take one\u2019s own\nlife when continuing to live is burdensome to others (Cholbi 2010b).\nOthers worry that a moral requirement to engage in suicide raises the\nsinister and totalitarian prospect that individuals may be obliged to\nengage in suicide against their wishes (Moreland & Geisler 1990,\n94, Pabst Battin 1996, 94\u201395). This worry may reflect an\nimplicit acceptance of a variation of the sanctity of life view (see\n section 3.2)\n or may reflect concerns about infringements upon individual\u2019s\nautonomy (see\n section 3.6).\n Other critics suggest that even if there is a duty to die, this duty\nshould not be understood as a duty that entails that others may compel\nthose with such a duty to take their lives (Menzel 2000, Narveson\n2000). Questions about social justice and equality (whether, for\nexample, especially vulnerable populations such as women or the poor\nmight be more likely to act on such a duty) are also raised. One\nutilitarian response to these objections is to reject a duty to die on\nrule utilitarian grounds: Suicide would be morally forbidden because\ngeneral adherence to a rule prohibiting suicide would produce better\noverall consequences than would general adherence to a rule permitting\nsuicide (Brandt 1975, Pabst Battin 1996, 96\u201398).\n",
