    "main_text": "The Paradox\n1. The Paradox\n\nCentral to any theory of sets is a statement of the conditions under\nwhich sets are formed. In addition to simply listing the members of a\nset, it was initially assumed that any well-defined condition (or\nprecisely specified property) could be used to determine a set. For\nexample, if \\(T\\) is the property of being a teacup, then the\nset, \\(S\\), of all teacups might be defined as \\(S = \\{x: T(x)\\}\\), the set of all individuals,\n\\(x\\), such that \\(x\\) has the property of being \\(T\\).\nEven a contradictory property might be used to determine a set. For\nexample, the property of being both \\(T\\) and not\\(-T\\)\nwould determine the empty set, the set having no members. \n\nMore precisely, na\u00efve set theory assumes the so-called na\u00efve\nor unrestricted Comprehension Axiom, the axiom that for any formula\n\\(\\phi(x)\\) containing \\(x\\) as a free variable, there will\nexist the set \\(\\{x: \\phi(x)\\}\\) whose members are\nexactly those objects that satisfy \\(\\phi(x)\\). Thus, if the\nformula \\(\\phi(x)\\) stands for \u201c\\(x\\) is\nprime\u201d, then \\(\\{x: \\phi(x)\\}\\) will be the set of\nprime numbers. If \\(\\phi(x)\\) stands for \u201c\\({\\sim}(x = x)\\)\u201d, then \\(\\{x: \\phi(x)\\}\\) will be the\nempty set. \n\nBut from the assumption of this axiom, Russell\u2019s contradiction\nfollows. For example, if we let \\(\\phi(x)\\) stand for \\(x \\in x\\) and\nlet \\(R = \\{x: {\\sim}\\phi(x)\\}\\), then \\(R\\) is the set whose members\nare exactly those objects that are not members of themselves.\n\nIs \\(R\\) a member of itself? If it is, then it must satisfy the\ncondition of not being a member of itself and so it is not. If it is\nnot, then it must not satisfy the condition of not being a member of\nitself, and so it must be a member of itself. Since by classical logic\none case or the other must hold \u2013 either \\(R\\) is a member\nof itself or it is not \u2013 it follows that the theory implies a\ncontradiction.\n\nAs Russell tells us, it was after he applied the same kind of\nreasoning found in Cantor\u2019s diagonal argument to a\n\u201csupposed class of all imaginable objects\u201d that he was led\nto the contradiction:\n\nThe comprehensive class we are considering, which is to embrace\neverything, must embrace itself as one of its members. In other words,\nif there is such a thing as \u201ceverything,\u201d then,\n\u201ceverything\u201d is something, and is a member of the class\n\u201ceverything.\u201d But normally a class is not a member of\nitself. Mankind, for example, is not a man. Form now the assemblage of\nall classes which are not members of themselves. This is a class: is\nit a member of itself or not? If it is, it is one of those classes\nthat are not members of themselves, i.e., it is not a member of\nitself. If it is not, it is not one of those classes that are not\nmembers of themselves, i.e. it is a member of itself. Thus of the two\nhypotheses \u2013 that it is, and that it is not, a member of itself\n\u2013 each implies its contradictory. This is a contradiction.\n(1919, 136)\n\n\nStandard responses to the paradox attempt to limit in some way the\nconditions under which sets are formed. The goal is usually both to\neliminate \\(R\\) (and similar contradictory sets) and, at the same\ntime, to retain all other sets needed for mathematics. This is often\ndone by replacing the unrestricted Comprehension Axiom with the more\nrestrictive Separation Axiom, namely the axiom that given any\n(consistent) set \\(S\\) and any formula \\(\\phi(x)\\) with \\(x\\) free,\nthere will be a set \\(\\{x \\in S: \\phi(x)\\}\\) whose members are exactly\nthose members of \\(S\\) that satisfy \\(\\phi(x)\\). If we now let\n\\(\\phi(x)\\) stand for the formula \\(x \\not\\in x\\), it turns out that\nthe corresponding set, \\(\\{x \\in S: x \\not\\in x\\}\\) will not be\ncontradictory since it consists only of those members found within S\nthat are not members of themselves. Hence the set fails to include\nitself. \n\nA variety of related paradoxes is discussed in the second chapter of\nthe Introduction to Whitehead and Russell (1910, 2nd edn 60-65), as\nwell as in the entry on\n paradoxes and contemporary logic\n in this encyclopedia. \n",
