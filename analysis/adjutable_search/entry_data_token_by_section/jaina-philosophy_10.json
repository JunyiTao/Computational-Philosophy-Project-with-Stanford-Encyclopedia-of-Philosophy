    "main_text": "Epistemology || Authoritative teaching\n3.2 Authoritative teaching\n\nIn this conception in which human beings are in principle able to\nexperience up to absolute cognition, it becomes possible even for\nsomeone who is not yet liberated to have a share in this, by relying\non the teaching of liberated beings. Such a possibility is especially\nvaluable, since knowing the phenomena unknowable by ordinary\ncognition, like the nature of the self, what happens after death, or\nthe primary cause and final end of the world, is essential inasmuch as\nit conditions one\u2019s spiritual progress towards the realization\nof a proper human life. In this dynamic, Jaina philosophers consider\nthat a discourse is authoritative if it is uttered by such a liberated\nteacher, who is called \u201cthe one who has achieved, who is apt,\nreliable\u201d (\u0101pta).\n\nFirst, Jaina philosophers are here not concerned with everyday life\ntestimony, but with soteriological testimony.\n\nSecond, with this definition of an authoritative discourse, they are\nopposing the conceptions of the exegetes of the Veda, who consider\nthat an authoritative discourse is by definition non-human, whatever\none\u2019s spiritual advancement, since the universal validity of a\ncorpus can only come from the power of language itself.\n\nThird, we said that liberated beings were absolutely isolated not\ninteracting life-monads. However, one reaches a state of experience of\nabsolute cognition before reaching liberation. More precisely, when\nall knowledge obscuring karmas are removed, one still has to wait for\na long time for non-harming karmas to also be exhausted. This is\nwithin this laps of time that the teaching of the Jinas happens.\n\nFourth, direct disciples of the liberated beings also experience extra\nmundane types of cognition, although lesser ones. This make them the\nperfect medium to interpret the sacred teaching and transmit it to us.\nIn such a way that \u201ccorrect interpretation depends upon a\nteacher-pupil lineage or upon one\u201ds own seniority and\nwisdom\u2019 (Jyv\u00e4sj\u00e4rvi 2010). Indeed, an advanced monk is\nby definition both more knowledgeable and less deceptive (Fl\u00fcgel\n2010 [2016]). The fact that one can access soteriological relevant\nknowledge thanks to monks who are living members of a lineage of\ninterpretation is in part what explains the importance of theories of\ninterpretation in Jaina philosophy, as well as the fact that the\ncommentaries are regularly more important than the canon itself.\n\nIn the Manual for the behavior of laymen which is casket of\njewel\n(Ratna-kara\u1e47\u1e0da-\u015br\u0101vak\u00e2c\u0101ra\n[RK\u015a\u0100]), Samantabhadra (530\u2013590 CE) characterizes the\nauthoritative teacher in the following way:\n\n\nRK\u015a\u0100 1.6. This one is called the reliable one who has no\nhunger, thirst, old age, affliction (of body and of mind), birth,\ndeath, fear, pride, attachment, aversion, delusion.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the authoritative speaker is presented as a God-like\nentity who has moral aptitudes before he has intellectual ones, since,\nas we have seen, this is a step to reach unobstructed, absolute,\nknowledge, has a series of consequences on Jaina epistemology (Gorisse\n2022a). Especially, since these liberated beings have no intention, an\nauthoritative teacher who gives instructions does good to the people\nwithout being motivated by passions. He acts for the benefit of\nhumanity on account of his very nature, like a drum giving out sound\nat the touch of a beater does not want anything for itself:\n\n\nRK\u015a\u0100 1.8. Un-egoistically and dispassionately a teacher\ninstructs from truth what is suitable. What (else) does a\nmuraja-drum require to sound but the touch of a skillful\nhand?\n\n\n\nOne consequence is that in Jainism, testimonial cognition can be\nconsidered as a proper means of knowledge, because knowledge acquired\nthanks to the teaching of an authoritative person is proper knowledge\nof what exists as it is, and not knowledge of what exists\nas intended. Now, this holds only if he authoritative speaker\nbelongs to the very specific category of speakers that we have seen.\nThis has the consequence that what is recognized as an authoritative\ndiscourse are the Jaina sacred Scriptures and their commentaries.\n\nFinally, we should keep in mind that this is consistently within an\napologetic objective to defend one\u2019s own scriptural tradition\n(Qvarnstr\u00f6m 2006) and to attack the one of others that the\ndifferent philosophico-traditions of India aimed to rationally justify\na given set of claims and that they developed their logical frameworks\nin the form of what can rightfully be called a \u201csystematic\nphilosophy\u201d, as we will investigate in the next paragraph. One\nissue in which the co-existence of a more systematic and a more\ndogmatic approach is manifest is the shift that happened with notably\nthe Buddhist Dharmak\u012brti (550\u2013610) in his\nConsiderations on knowledge\n(Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika [PV]), when a transition was\nmade from external criteria for the reliability of a discourse, like\nthe existence of an authoritative utterer; to internal criteria, like\nsoundness of the assertions themselves, or ability of the proponent to\nshow a proof for these assertions. The Jaina tradition experiences\nthis shift especially with the author Samantabhadra in his\nInvestigation on Authority\n(\u0100pta-m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 [\u0100M\u012b])\n(Balcerowicz 2016a).\n",
