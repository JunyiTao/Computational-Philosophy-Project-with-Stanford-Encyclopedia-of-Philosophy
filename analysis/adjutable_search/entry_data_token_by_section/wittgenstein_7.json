    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein || Meaning as Use\n3.3 Meaning as Use\n\n\u201cFor a large class of cases of the employment of the\nword \u2018meaning\u2019\u2014though not for all\u2014this word\ncan be explained in this way: the meaning of a word is its use in the\nlanguage\u201d (PI 43). This basic statement is what\nunderlies the change of perspective most typical of the later phase of\nWittgenstein\u2019s thought: a change from a conception of meaning as\nrepresentation to a view which looks to use as the crux of the\ninvestigation. Traditional theories of meaning in the history of\nphilosophy were intent on pointing to something exterior to the\nproposition which endows it with sense. This \u2018something\u2019\ncould generally be located either in an objective space, or inside the\nmind as mental representation. As early as 1933 (The Blue\nBook) Wittgenstein took pains to challenge these conceptions,\narriving at the insight that \u201cif we had to name anything which\nis the life of the sign, we should have to say that it was its\nuse\u201d (BB 4). Ascertainment of the use (of a\nword, of a proposition), however, is not given to any sort of\nconstructive theory building, as in the Tractatus. Rather,\nwhen investigating meaning, the philosopher must \u201clook and\nsee\u201d the variety of uses to which the word is put. An analogy\nwith tools sheds light on the nature of words. When we think of tools\nin a toolbox, we do not fail to see their variety; but the\n\u201cfunctions of words are as diverse as the functions of these\nobjects\u201d (PI 11). We are misled by the uniform\nappearance of our words into theorizing upon meaning:\n\u201cEspecially when we are doing philosophy!\u201d (PI\n12)\n\nSo different is this new perspective that Wittgenstein repeats:\n\u201cDon\u2019t think, but look!\u201d (PI 66); and such\nlooking is done vis a vis particular cases, not\ngeneralizations. In giving the meaning of a word, any explanatory\ngeneralization should be replaced by a description of use. The\ntraditional idea that a proposition houses a content and has a\nrestricted number of Fregean forces (such as assertion, question, and\ncommand), gives way to an emphasis on the diversity of uses. In order\nto address the countless multiplicity of uses, their un-fixedness, and\ntheir being part of an activity, Wittgenstein introduces the key\nconcept of \u2018language-game.\u2019 He never explicitly defines it\nsince, as opposed to the earlier \u2018picture,\u2019 for instance,\nthis new concept is made to do work for a more fluid, more\ndiversified, and more activity-oriented perspective on language.\nHence, indeed, the requirement to define harkens back to an old dogma,\nwhich misses the playful and active character of language.\n",
