    "main_text": "\n\nAristotle\u2019s logic, especially his theory of the syllogism, has\nhad an unparalleled influence on the history of Western thought. It\ndid not always hold this position: in the Hellenistic period, Stoic\nlogic, and in particular the work of Chrysippus, took pride of place.\nHowever, in later antiquity, following the work of Aristotelian\nCommentators, Aristotle\u2019s logic became dominant, and\nAristotelian logic was what was transmitted to the Arabic and the\nLatin medieval traditions, while the works of Chrysippus have not\nsurvived.\n\nThis unique historical position has not always contributed to the\nunderstanding of Aristotle\u2019s logical works. Kant thought that\nAristotle had discovered everything there was to know about logic, and\nthe historian of logic Prantl drew the corollary that any logician\nafter Aristotle who said anything new was confused, stupid, or\nperverse. During the rise of modern formal logic following Frege and\nPeirce, adherents of Traditional Logic (seen as the descendant of\nAristotelian Logic) and the new mathematical logic tended to see one\nanother as rivals, with incompatible notions of logic. More recent\nscholarship has often applied the very techniques of mathematical\nlogic to Aristotle\u2019s theories, revealing (in the opinion of\nmany) a number of similarities of approach and interest between\nAristotle and modern logicians.\n\nThis article is written from the latter perspective. As such, it is\nabout Aristotle\u2019s logic, which is not always the same thing as\nwhat has been called \u201cAristotelian\u201d logic.\n",
