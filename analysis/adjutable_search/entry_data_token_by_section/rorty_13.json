    "main_text": "Rorty in the Conversations of Philosophy || Critical Responses\n4.1 Critical Responses\n\nBy 1970, the year Rorty was promoted to full professor at Princeton,\nhe had made a name for himself in analytic philosophy. He had written\na series of original and often prescient essays (MLM) on issues then\nat the of center of professional attention, notably in philosophy of\nmind and metaphilosophy, and he had also edited the volume, The\nLinguistic Turn: Essays in Philosophical Method (1992). This\ncollection of papers by prominent contributors, framed by\nRorty\u2019s extensive introduction, received a great deal of\nattention and acclaim. It did much to cement the idea of a linguistic\nturn (Rorty attributes the notion to Gustav Bergman (Rorty 1992, xx))\nas a sea change in the history of philosophy.\n\nThroughout the 1970s Rorty\u2019s metaphilosophical papers prodded\nthe self-understanding of contemporary analytical philosophy,\nadvocating the relevance of American pragmatism, Wittgenstein, and\nthinkers in the European Continental tradition to the self-conception\nof post-positivist analytic philosophy. It is well documented that\nRorty became increasingly disenchanted with the practice of philosophy\nas it was conducted by the dominant figures in the Princeton\ndepartment during this period, and no doubt the feeling was\nreciprocated (Gross, 2008).\n\nNevertheless, within the philosophical community at large,\nRorty\u2019s standing was such that he was elected President of the\nEastern Division of the American Philosophical Association for the\nacademic year 1979\u20131980. Just weeks before he gave the\nPresidential Address (\u201cPragmatism, Relativism, and\nIrrationalism,\u201d see RR), however, PMN was published by Princeton\nUniversity Press. To Rorty\u2019s surprise (Rorty in Lewis-Kraus,\n2003), this monograph was read as an attack on the basic creed of\nanalytic philosophy as such, rather than as an attempt at benevolent\nreform. Most reviews were hostile to what was regarded as\nRorty\u2019s end-of-philosophy message, and in the years that\nfollowed, Rorty\u2019s challenge to representationalist epistemology\nwas in many influential quarters studiously ignored.\n\nIn retrospect, the hostility may appear excessive, but understandable.\nAs we have seen in connection with Rorty\u2019s attitude to science,\nit is particularly Rorty\u2019s treatment of truth and knowledge that\ndrew fire from philosophers. While a great variety of philosophers\nhave criticized Rorty on this general score in a great variety of\nways, a common concern stands out; Rorty\u2019s conversationalist\nview of truth and knowledge leaves us entirely unable to account for\nthe notion that a reasonable view of how things are is a view suitably\nconstrained by how the world actually is. This criticism is levelled\nagainst Rorty not only from the standpoint of metaphysical and\nscientific realist views of the sort that Rorty hoped would soon be\nextinct. It is expressed also by thinkers who respect Rorty\u2019s\ndialectical acumen, who have some sympathy with Rorty\u2019s\nhistoricist view of intellectual progress, and who find persuasive his\ncritique of Kantian and Platonist features of modern philosophy. John\nMcDowell (McDowell, 1994), for instance, claims that Rorty\u2019s\nview of the relation between agent and world as merely causal runs\nafoul of the notion that our very concept of a creature with beliefs\ninvolves the idea of a rational constraint of the world on our\nepistemic states. Pascal Engel, in his exchange with Rorty on the\nnotion of truth (Rorty and Engel, 2007), takes Rorty to task for\ngiving up the very notion that undergirds rational argument and\nconviction, without which it is hard to see what the remit of\nphilosophy might possibly be.\n\nHowever, critics are not concerned only with what they see as a\nmisguided view of belief, truth, and knowledge, whether relativist,\nsubjectivist, or idealist in nature. An important reason for the high\ntemperature of much of the debate that Rorty has inspired is that he\nappears to some to reject the very values that are the basis for any\narticulation of a philosophical view of truth and knowledge at all. As\nEngel emphasizes, Rorty is indeed critical of the role of argument in\nintellectual progress, and he is dismissive of the very idea of\ntheories of truth, of knowledge, of rationality, and the like.\nPhilosophers such as Hilary Putnam and Susan Haack, who shared\nRorty\u2019s view that analytic philosophy would do well to\nincorporate the lessons of American pragmatism, focused their\ncriticisms on exactly this aspect of Rorty\u2019s views. Haack, in\nparticular, frames her attacks on Rorty along these lines in moral\nterms; to her mind, Rorty\u2019s efforts to abandon the basic\nconcepts of traditional epistemology are symptoms of a vulgar\ncynicism, which contributes to the decline of reason and intellectual\nintegrity that Haack and others find to be characteristic of much\ncontemporary thought. The charge of intellectual irresponsibility is\nsometimes raised, or at last implied, in connection with Rorty\u2019s\nuse of historical figures. Rorty\u2019s reading of Descartes and of\nKant in PMN have often been challenged, as has his more constructive\nuses of Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein. The kind of\nappropriation of other writers and thinkers that Rorty performs will\nat times seem to do violence to the views and intentions of the\nprotagonists. Rorty, however, is quite clear about the rhetorical\npoint and scholarly limitations of these kinds of redescriptions, as\nhe explains in \u201cThe Historiography of Philosophy: Four\nGenres\u201d (Rorty, 1984).\n",
