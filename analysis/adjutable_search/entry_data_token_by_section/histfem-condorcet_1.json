    "main_text": "Life and Ideas\n2. Life and Ideas\n\nCondorcet was born on 17 September 1743 in the town of\nRibemont-sur-Aisne, in Picardy, to the previously widowed\nMarie-Magdeleine Gaudry and her spouse, the Chevalier Antoine de\nCondorcet, a cavalry captain who was killed on maneuvers only weeks\nafter his son\u2019s birth. The Condorcets were an old noble family from\nthe Dauphin\u00e9. His ancestor Henri de Caritat was among the first\nto adopt the reformed faith in 1561 prior to its official toleration\nin 1598 under the terms of the Edict of Nantes. However, during Louis\nXIV\u2019s campaign against the Huguenots and the Revocation of the Edict\nin 1685, members of the family who did not emigrate were forcibly\nreconverted to the Roman church. By the time of his birth, like other\nmale heirs of this family, Condorcet would have been expected to serve\nthe military or the church. Following his father\u2019s untimely death,\nCondorcet was brought up in isolation by his deeply pious mother, who\ndedicated him for his protection to the virgin, clothing him in white\ndresses until the unconventionally late age of eight. At the\ninstigation of his paternal uncle, the orthodox-leaning bishop of\nLisieux, Condorcet began his formal education at age nine with a\nJesuit instructor; and at age eleven he was enrolled for four years in\nthe Jesuit school at Reims, where he had his first academic success,\nwinning second prize at age thirteen.\n\nDespite his own successes at school, in later years he decried the\nrole played by competition within the coll\u00e8ges of old\nr\u00e9gime France; and he joined other enlightened critics of the\nold order in vehemently opposing the religious control of education.\nIn the first of his 1791 writings on public instruction in the\nBiblioth\u00e8que de l\u2019homme public [The Public Man\u2019s\nLibrary], he emphasized a cooperative model of education, stating:\n\n\nHuman life is not a struggle in which rivals contend for prizes. It is\na voyage that brothers make together: where each employs his forces\nfor the good of all and is rewarded by the sweetness of mutual\nbenevolence, by the pleasure that comes with the sentiment of having\nearned the gratitude or the esteem of others .\u2026 By contrast,\nthe crowns bestowed in our coll\u00e8ges\u2014which induce\nthe schoolboy to believe himself already a great man\u2014only arouse\na childish vanity from which a wise system of instruction would seek\nto preserve us if, by misfortune, its origin lay in our nature and not\nin our blundering institutions. The habit of striving for first place\nis either ridiculous or unfortunate for the individual in whom it has\nbeen inculcated. It is a real calamity for those whom fate condemns to\nlive with him. The need to deserve esteem, on the other hand, leads to\nthat inner peace which alone makes happiness possible and virtue easy.\n(Condorcet, \u201cOn the Nature and Purpose of Public\nInstruction\u201d (1791) in Baker 1976,\n 139\u2013140)[7]\n\n\nThe mix of dogma and corporal punishment that he experienced in his\nJesuit schooling equally appalled Condorcet. In an unpublished\nmanuscript he remarked,\n\n\nThey teach children that they cannot do good acts without grace, and\nthat there are two sorts of sins: the venial, for which you are burnt\nfor a few centuries, and the mortal, for which you are burnt\neternally\u2026. Humiliation and opprobrium are the natural state of\nChristians. (unpublished ms. c. 1778, quoted by Badinter 1988, 19;\ntranslated and cited by McLean and Hewitt 1994, 3)\n\n\nHe advocated for a secular state; considering that since religious\nviews are a matter of one\u2019s conscience of which one is the sole\nlegitimate judge, \u201cit is evident that the expense of maintaining\nsuch worship should be voluntarily borne by those who believe in\nit\u201d (Condorcet, La Vie de Voltaire (1789), translated\nand cited in Rowe 1984, 19). As early as 1774, undoubtedly under the\nsway of his initial meeting with the illustrious Voltaire in 1770, he\naddressed the problem of religious intolerance in an anonymous work\nthat was frequently attributed to Voltaire himself. Despite his\nadmiration for his young acolyte, Voltaire (perhaps mischievously)\ncomplained, \u201cThis is a declaration of a hideous war \u2026 I\nwant neither the glory of having penned it nor the punishment that\nwill follow\u201d (cited in Baker 1976, x). Condorcet, however,\npersisted in his defense of a more secular society. Following 1789, he\npublicly promoted the principle of toleration and opposed the\nintrusion of religion into the new nation\u2019s public\n schools.[8]\n As he stated,\n\n\n\u2026religious opinions cannot form part of the common instruction\nsince they must be the choice of an independent conscience. No\nauthority has the right to prefer one over another. (Condorcet,\n\u201cPublic Instruction\u201d [1791], in Baker 1976, 127)\n\n\nBetween 1758 and 1760, Condorcet continued his studies in ethics,\nmetaphysics, logic and mathematics at the prestigious Coll\u00e8ge\nde Navarre, part of the University of Paris, where the Newtonian\nabb\u00e9 Jean-Antoine Nollet held France\u2019s first chair of\nexperimental physics. Under the tutelage of the abb\u00e9 Georges\nGirault de K\u00e9roudou, regent in philosophy at Navarre,\nCondorcet\u2019s talent for mathematics and philosophy blossomed. After a\ntwo-year stay in Ribemont following Navarre, during which time he\novercame family objections to his pursuit of a scientific career,\nCondorcet took up lodgings in Paris for a time with his former\nteacher, Girault de K\u00e9roudou, undertaking further study in\nproblems of the integral calculus. His first formal paper to the Royal\nAcademy of Science was rejected, although the mathematicians\nAl\u00e9xis-Claude Clairaut and Al\u00e9xis Fontaine recognized\nhis mathematical talent. With better results, he read a second paper\non the same topic before the Academy in 1764. With the endorsement of\nJean Le Rond d\u2019Alembert and \u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout, he published\nEssai sur le calcul integral [Essay on Integral Calculus],\nwhich merited a section in the annual Histoire de\nl\u2019Acad\u00e9mie des sciences for 1765, of which he was not yet\na member. The astronomer Joseph-Jer\u00f4me de Lalande, member of the\nBerlin and French Academies, ranked the then twenty-one year old\nCondorcet as one of the ten leading mathematicians in Europe; and his\nfurther applications of integral calculus impressed such renowned\nmathematicians as Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Leonhard Paul Euler, and\nDaniel Bernoulli. Through d\u2019Alembert, Condorcet was granted an\nintroduction to Voltaire, who would henceforth become another great\ninfluence on the young man; and he began attending the salon of Julie\n(Jeanne Julie \u00c9l\u00e9onore) de Lespinasse, a gathering place\nfor the leading philosophes of the day. There he met and\nbefriended the French economist and statesman Anne-Robert-Jacques\nTurgot (1727\u20131781)\u2014a proponent of physiocratic economic\ntheories and enlightened administration\u2014who, like Voltaire and\nd\u2019Alembert would play an important role in the young mathematician\u2019s\nevolution into an increasingly prominent public intellectual. At\nLespinasse\u2019s salon, he also met and began a close friendship with\nanother woman of letters and hostess of a literary salon, Amelie\nSuard, sister of the publisher Charles-Joseph Panckoucke and wife of\nthe academician Jean-Baptiste Suard. Both Lespinasse and Suard not\nonly encouraged the young man\u2019s intellectual appetites but also appear\nto have counseled him on matters of the heart and his social manners,\nwhich they regarded as rather unpolished (see Badinter 1988). In this\ncompany, he earned a reputation for being a quick-tempered but also\npainfully shy, socially ill at ease, and introverted young man. It was\nLespinasse who called him \u201ca volcano covered in snow\u201d,\nwhile Turgot saw him as \u201cthe rabid sheep\u201d, calm but always\non a short fuse (Williams 2004, 13).\n\nOn the professional front, Condorcet\u2019s success in the science of\nmathematical calculus came early, resulting in his appointment to the\nRoyal Academy of Sciences in 1769. In 1777 he became the permanent\nsecretary of the Academy of Sciences. In 1782, he was appointed to the\nFrench Academy, in recognition of his contribution to the world of\nletters. As a result, as Keith Michael Baker reveals,\n\n\nfor almost twenty years Condorcet was the principal spokesman of\norganized science not only in France but (given the power and prestige\nof the Paris Academy of Science \u2026 [and his post of perpetual\nsecretary]) throughout Europe. Above all, he emerges as the social\ntheorist of science as it developed under the Old Regime to shape some\nof the fundamental postulates of Enlightenment thought. (Baker 1975,\n385)\n\n\nIn the 1770s Condorcet first showed himself to be a talented and\npassionate polemicist, aiming to turn public administration to the\npublic good, while shrewdly appreciating how much power and position\nweighed in achieving the latter. As he wrote in an early letter to\nTurgot, who was then a royal official at Limoges, \u201cTo do good,\none must have as much power as goodwill\u201d (cited in Baker 1976,\nx). Upon Turgot\u2019s ascension to head of the financial administration of\nthe monarchy as Controller-General [in effect, Minister of Finance],\nCondorcet freely offered his services in the war of opinion. He\ndefended Turgot\u2019s introduction of free trade in grain, the abolition\nof guilds and corporations, and the suppression of the\ncorv\u00e9e: the forced labor system or taxation in kind\nassociated with seignurial rights and royal privilege. He pressed for\nreform of the country\u2019s system of weights and measures and\nparticipated in hydrodynamic experiments to determine the engineering\nprinciples of canal construction. Like Turgot\u2019s other short-lived\nreforms, Condorcet also embraced the latter\u2019s unsuccessful proposal to\nreform the system of political representation in France by introducing\na hierarchy of assemblies from the local to the national\n level.[9]\n The minister\u2019s abrupt fall from power in May 1776 left him in deep\ndespair: \u201cthis event has changed the whole of nature for\nme\u201d, he wrote to Voltaire from Ribemont. \u201c I no longer\ntake the same pleasure in this beautiful countryside where he would\nhave brought forth happiness\u2026 How far we are fallen, my dear\nand illustrious master, and from such height\u201d (cited in Baker\n1976, xii).\n\nCondorcet would continue to honor Turgot\u2019s efforts at reform as he\ndeveloped his own ideas about how best to achieve political justice\nthrough the ballot and constitutional revision, as in his essential\nwork Essai sur la constitution et ses functions des\nassembl\u00e9es provinciales [Essay on the Constitution and the\nFunctions of Provincial Assemblies] (1788). In La Vie de\nTurgot [Life of Turgot] (1786), he celebrated his belated\nfriend\u2019s contributions to public administration and free trade.\nMoreover, like his mentor, Condorcet rejected naked self-interest as\nthe only motivator of human behavior, insisting on the role to be\nplayed by love and sympathy. In a correspondence concerning Turgot\u2019s\nrepudiation of the unmodified utilitarianism of Claude Adrien\nHelv\u00e9tius\u2019 De l\u2019Esprit [On Mind] (1759), Condorcet\nadvanced his own thoughts on sympathy and ethics:\n [10]\n\nI have just received your profession of faith: here is mine. When I\nleft college, I fell to reflecting on the moral ideas of justice and\nvirtue. I felt that I saw that the interest we have in being just and\nvirtuous arose from the pain one sensitive being must needs feel on\nbecoming aware of the pain suffered by another. Since then, [and out\nof a fear that other interests would make me evil (m\u00e9chant)] I\nhave tried to preserve this sentiment in all its natural energy. I\ngave up hunting, which I had enjoyed, and would not even kill an\ninsect unless it was very harmful. (Cited in McLean and Hewitt 1994,\n 7)[11]\n\n\nDuring the 1780s and into the early Revolution, Condorcet would devote\nhimself increasingly to \u201cle bien public\u201d [the public\ngood]. For example, he addressed the subject of healthcare, with the\nhope of ending a system long associated with indigence and Christian\ncharity. In his 1786 Memoire sur les h\u00f4pitaux [Memoir\non Hospitals], he suggested closing down the thousand-year old\nmunicipal hospital of the city of Paris, the\nH\u00f4tel-Dieu, and replacing it with a secular,\nlocally-based, municipal health-delivery system composed of small\nneighborhood hospices. He was also not averse to changing his earlier\nformulated positions. In 1793, for example, he reversed his argument\nput forward in 1788 against progressive taxation, in favor of the same\n(see Greenbaum 1984 and Perkins 1984).\n\nMost significant, however, were the evolution of his political views,\nfrom support of a reformed, constitutional monarchy to defense of a\ndemocratic republic, from defense of a property-based franchise to\nuniversal suffrage. He was elected to the Electoral Assembly to\nrepresent the nobility from the bailiwick around his country place at\nMantes. Although he did not serve in the first National Assembly\nfollowing the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, he was elected by\nhis residential district to the General Assembly of the first Paris\nCommune. In October 1791, he was elected to the National Legislative\nAssembly, where he served and then chaired the Committee on Public\nInstruction. In this same year, he looked optimistically toward the\nfuture. Writing under the pseudonym \u201cUn Vieux Bramine\u201d [An\nOld Brahmin] in La Bouche fer, Bulletin du Cercle\nSocial [The Iron Mouth, the Bulletin of the (club) The Social\nCircle], he addressed himself to other friends of liberty,\nproclaiming:\n\n\nI believe humankind is infinitely perfectible, and that it should thus\ndevote itself to achieving peace, liberty and equality, whose term is\nimpossible to fix. I also believe that this progress must be the work\nof reason, fortified by meditation, supported by experience. According\nto these principles, my philosophy has to be cold and patient \u2026\nI would not say, \u201ceverything is good\u201d but rather that\n\u201ceverything will be good\u201d, and, for that, I will offend\nboth sides. [my translation] (cited in Robinet 1968 [orig. 1893],\n 101).[12]\n\n\nHis evolving republican views were confirmed after the King\u2019s flight\nand capture at Varennes in June 1791, and following the attack on July\n17, 1791 on peaceful demonstrators on the Champ-de-Mars (petitioning\nfor a removal of king Louis XVI) by the troops commanded by General\nLafayette (an earlier ally of Condorcet), an event which Condorcet\ntook personally as his wife and infant daughter were among the crowd\non that day. In the fall of 1792, he gained election to the National\nConvention of the newly constituted first French Republic, for which\nhe served by election as one of the nine members of the Committee on a\nConstitution, of which he was then made chairman. In Condorcet\u2019s\nview,\n\n\na republican constitution based upon equality was the only one in\naccordance with nature, reason and justice: the only one that can\nprotect the liberty of citizens and the dignity of the human race.\n(Rosenblum 1984, 188; for the text of the Projet de\nConstitution [Project of the Constitution], see Condorcet\nO\u2019Connor and Arago, vol. 12, 335\u2013415)\n\n\nYet Condorcet\u2019s constitutional plan, which came to be known as\n\u201cLa Girondine\u201d in accordance with the majority of Girondin\ndeputies who served on this committee (although Condorcet was not\none), was never acted upon by the Convention. The Jacobin\nConstitution, accepted by the Convention of June 24, 1793, was never\nimplemented. However, Condorcet\u2019s impassioned attack on the latter and\ndefense of his own views in \u201cAux citoyens fran\u00e7ais, sur\nla nouvelle constitution\u201d [To French Citizens, on the New\nConstitution] led to the order for his arrest on June 8.\n",
