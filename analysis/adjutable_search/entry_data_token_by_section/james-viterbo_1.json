    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Theology as a Practical Science\n2.1 Theology as a Practical Science\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, James devotes serious attention to\ndetermining the status of theology as a science and to specifying its\nobject, or rather, as the scholastics say, its subject. In\nQuodlibet III, q. 1, he asks whether theology is principally\na practical or a speculative science. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, for an\nAugustinian, James responds that the end of theology resides\nprincipally not in the knowledge but in the love of God. The love of\nGod, informed by grace, is what distinguishes the way in which\nChristians worship God from the way in which pagans worship their\ndeities. For philosophers\u2014James has Cicero in\nmind\u2014religion is a species of justice; worship is owed to God as\na sign of submission. For the Christian, by contrast, there can be no\nworship without an internal affection of the soul, i.e., without love.\nJames allows that there is some recognition of this fact in Book X of\nthe Nicomachean Ethics, for the happy man would not be\n\u201cmost beloved of God,\u201d as Aristotle claims he is, if he\ndid not love God by making him the object of his theorizing. In this\nsense, it can be said that philosophy as well sees its end as the love\nof God as its principal subject. But there is a difference, James\ncontends, in the manner in which a science based on natural reason\naims for the love of God and the manner in which sacred science does\nso: sacred science tends to the love of God more perfectly. One way in\nwhich James illustrates the difference between both approaches is by\ncontrasting the ways in which God is the \u201chighest\u201d object\nfor metaphysics and for theology. The proper subject of metaphysics is\nbeing, not God, although God is the highest being. Theology, on the\nother hand, views God as its subject and considers being in relation\nto God. Thus, James concludes, \u201ctheology is called divine or of\nGod in a much more excellent and principal way than metaphysics, for\nmetaphysics considers God only in relation to common being, whereas\ntheology considers common being in relation to God\u201d\n(Quodl. III, q. 1, p. 20, 370\u2013374). Another way in\nwhich James illustrates the difference between natural theology and\nsacred science is by means of the distinction between the love of\ndesire (amor concupiscientiae) and the love of friendship\n(amor amicitiae) to which I will return in section 7.3. James\ndefines the love of desire as \u201cthe love of some good which we\nwant for ourselves or for others,\u201d and the love of friendship as\n\u201cthe love of someone for their own sake.\u201d The love of God\nphilosophers have in mind, James contends, is the love of desire; it\ncannot, by the philosophers\u2019 own admission, be the love of\nfriendship, for according to the Magna Moralia, friendship\ninvolves a form of community or sharing between the friends that\ncannot possibly obtain between mere mortals and the gods. Now although\nJames concedes that a \u201ccommunity of life\u201d between God and\nman cannot be achieved by natural means, it is attainable through the\ngift of grace. The particular friendship grace affords is called\ncharity and it is to the conferring of charity that sacred scripture\nis principally ordered.\n",
