    "main_text": "Composition Principles || Composition, Existence, and Identity\n4.5 Composition, Existence, and Identity\n\nThe algebraic strength of GEM, and of its weaker\nfinitary and infinitary variants, is worth emphasizing, but it also\nreflects substantive mereological postulates whose philosophical\nunderpinnings leave room for considerable controversy well beyond the\ngunk/junk dispute. Indeed, all composition principles turn\nout to be controversial, just as the decomposition principles examined\nin Section 3. For, on the one hand, it appears that the weaker,\nrestricted formulations, from (P.11\u03be) to\n(P.15\u03c8,i), are just not doing enough work: not\nonly do they depend on the specification of the relevant limiting\nconditions, as expressed by the predicates \u2018\u03be\u2019 and\n\u2018\u03c8\u2019; they also treat such conditions as merely\nsufficient for the existence of bounds and sums, whereas ideally we\nare interested in an account of conditions that are both sufficient\nand necessary. On the other hand, the stronger, unrestricted\nformulations appear to go too far, for while they rule out the\npossibility of junky worlds, they also commit the theory to the\nexistence of a large variety of prima facie implausible,\nunheard-of mereological composites\u2014a large variety of\n\u201cjunk\u201d in the good old sense of the word.\n\nConcerning the first sort of worry, one could of course construe every\nrestricted composition principle as a biconditional expressing both a\nsufficient and a necessary condition for the existence of an\nupper bound, or a sum, of a given pair or set of entities. But then\nthe question of how such conditions should be construed becomes\ncrucial, on pain of turning a weak sufficient condition into an\nexceedingly strong requirement. For example, with regard to\n(P.11\u03be) we have mentioned the idea of construing\n\u2018\u03be\u2019 as \u2018O\u2019, the rationale being that\nmereological overlap establishes an important connection between what\nmay count as two distinct parts of a larger (integral) whole. However,\nas a necessary condition overlap is obviously too stringent. The top\nhalf of my body and the bottom half do not overlap, yet they do form\nan integral whole. The topological relation of contact, i.e., overlap\nor abut, might be a better candidate. Yet even that would be\ntoo stringent. We may have misgivings about the existence of scattered\nentities consisting of totally disconnected parts, such as my umbrella\nand your left shoe or, worse, the head of this trout and the body of\nthat turkey (Lewis 1991: 7\u20138). Yet in other cases it appears\nperfectly natural to countenance wholes that are composed of two or\nmore disconnected entities: a bikini, a token of the lowercase letter\n\u2018i\u2019, my copy of The Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n(R. Cartwright 1975; Chisholm 1987)\u2014indeed any garden-variety\nmaterial object, insofar as it turns out to be a swarm of spatially\nisolated elementary particles (van Inwagen 1990). Similarly for some\nevents, such as Dante's writing of Inferno versus the sum of\nSebastian's stroll in Bologna and Caesar's crossing of Rubicon (see\nThomson 1977: 53f). More generally, intuition and common sense suggest\nthat some mereological composites exist, not all; yet the\nquestion of which composites exist seems to be up for grabs.\nConsider a series of almost identical mereological aggregates that\nbegins with a case where composition appears to obtain (e.g., the sum\nof all body cells that currently make up my body, the relative\ndistance among any two neighboring ones being less than 1 nanometer)\nand ends in a case where composition would seem not to obtain (e.g.,\nthe sum of all body cells that currently make up my body, after their\nrelative distance has been increased to 1 kilometer). Where should we\ndraw the line? In other words\u2014and to limit ourselves to\n(P.15\u03c8,i)\u2014what value of n would\nmark a change of truth-value in the soritical sequence generated by\nthe schema\n\n\n(62)\nThe set of all \u03c6-ers has a sumi if and\nonly if every \u03c6 is \u03c8, \n\n\nwhen \u2018\u03c6\u2019 picks out my body cells and\n\u2018\u03c8\u2019 expresses the condition \u2018less than\nn+1 nanometers apart from another \u03c6-er\u2019? It may\nwell be that whenever some entities compose a bigger one, it is just a\nbrute fact that they do so (Markosian 1998b), perhaps a matter of\ncontingent fact (Nolan 2005: 36, Cameron 2007). But if we are unhappy\nwith brute facts, if we are looking for a principled way of drawing\nthe line so as to specify the circumstances under which the facts\nobtain, then the question is truly challenging. That is, it is a\nchallenging question short of treating it as a mere verbal dispute, if\nnot denying that it makes any sense to raise it in the first place\n(see Hirsch 2005 and Putnam 1987: 16ff, respectively; see also Dorr\n2005 and McGrath 2008 for relevant discussion). This is, effectively,\nvan Inwagen's \u201cSpecial Composition Question\u201d mentioned in\nSection 4.1, an early formulation of which may be found in Hestevold\n(1981). For the most part, the literature that followed has focused on\nthe conditions of composition for material objects, as in Sanford\n(1993), Horgan (1993), Hoffman and Rosenkrantz (1997), Merricks\n(2001), Hawley (2006), Markosian (2008), Vander Laan (2010), and Silva\n(2013). Occasionally the question has been discussed in relation to\nthe ontology of actions, as in Chant (2006). In its most general form,\nhowever, the Special Composition Question may be asked with respect to\nany domain of entities whatsoever.\n\nConcerning the second worry, to the effect that the\nunrestricted sum principles in (P.15i)\nwould go too far, its earliest formulations are almost as old as the\nprinciples themselves (see e.g. V. Lowe 1953 and Rescher 1955 on the\ncalculus of individuals, with replies in Goodman 1956, 1958). Here one\npopular line of response, inspired by Quine (1981: 10), is simply to\ninsist that the pattern in (P.15i) is the only\nplausible option, disturbing as this might sound. Granted, common\nsense and intuition dictate that some and only some mereological\ncomposites exist, but we have just seen that it is hard to draw a\nprincipled line. On pain of accepting brute facts, it would appear\nthat any attempt to do away with queer sums by restricting composition\nwould have to do away with too much else besides the queer entities;\nfor queerness comes in degrees whereas parthood and existence cannot\nbe a matter of degree (though we shall return to this issue in Section\n5). As Lewis (1986b: 213) puts it, no restriction on composition can\nbe vague, but unless it is vague, it cannot fit the intuitive\ndesiderata. Thus, no restriction on composition could serve\nthe intuitions that motivate it; any restriction would be arbitrary,\nhence gratuitous. And if that is the case, then either mereological\ncomposition never obtains or else the only non-arbitrary, non-brutal\nanswer to the question, Under what conditions does a set have a\nsumi?, would be the radical one afforded by\n(P.15i): Under any condition whatsoever. (This\nline of reasoning is further elaborated in Lewis 1991: 79ff as well as\nin Heller 1990: 49f, Jubien 1993: 83ff; Sider 2001: 121ff, Hudson\n2001: 99ff, and Van Cleve 2008: \u00a73; for reservations and critical\ndiscussion, see Merricks 2005, D. Smith 2006, Nolan 2006, Korman 2008,\n2010, Wake 2011, Carmichael 2011, and Effingham 2009, 2011a, 2011c.)\nBesides, it might be observed that any complaints about the\ncounterintuitiveness of unrestricted composition rest on psychological\nbiases that should have no bearing on the question of how the world is\nactually structured. Granted, we may feel uneasy about treating\nshoe-umbrellas and trout-turkeys as bona fide entities, but\nthat is no ground for doing away with them altogether. We may ignore\nsuch entities when we tally up the things we care about in ordinary\ncontexts, but that is not to say they do not exist. Even if\none came up \u201cwith a formula that jibed with all ordinary\njudgments about what counts as a unit and what does not\u201d (Van\nCleve 1986: 145), what would that show? The psychological factors that\nguide our judgments of unity simply do not have the sort of\nontological significance that should be guiding our construction of a\ngood mereological theory, short of thinking that composition itself is\nmerely a secondary quality (as in Kriegel 2008). In the words of\nThomson (1998: 167): reality is like \u201can over-crowded\nattic\u201d, with some interesting contents and a lot of junk, in the\nordinary sense of the term. We can ignore the junk and leave it to\ngather dust; but it is there and it won't go away. (One residual\nproblem, that such observations do not quite address, concerns the\nstatus of cross-categorial sums. Absent any restriction, a\npluralist ontology might involve trout-turkeys and shoe-umbrellas\nalong with trout-promenades, shoe-virtues, color-numbers, and what\nnot. It is certainly possible to conceive of some such\nthings, as in the theory of structured propositions mentioned in\nSection 2.1, or in certain neo-Aristotelian metaphysics that construe\nobjects as mereological sums of a \u201cmaterial\u201d and a\n\u201cformal\u201d part; see e.g. Fine 1999, 2010, Koslicki 2007,\n2008, and Toner 2012. There are also theories that allow for composite\nobjects consisting of both \u201cpositive\u201d and\n\u201cnegative\u201d parts, e.g., a donut, as in Hoffman and\nRichards 1985. At the limit, however, the universal entity U\nwould involve parts of all ontological kinds. And there would\nseem to be nothing arbitrary, let alone any psychological biases, in\nthe thought that at least such monsters should be banned. For\na statement of this view, see Simons 2003, 2006; for a reply, see\nVarzi 2006b.)\n\nA third worry, which applies to all (restricted or unrestricted)\ncomposition principles, is this. Mereology is supposed to be\nontologically \u201cneutral\u201d. But it is a fact that the models\nof a theory cum composition principles tend to be more\ndensely populated than those of the corresponding composition-free\ntheories. If the ontological commitment of a theory is measured in\nQuinean terms\u2014via the dictum \u201cto be is to be a\nvalue of a bound variable\u201d (1939: 708)\u2014it follows that\nsuch theories involve greater ontological commitments than their\ncomposition-free counterparts. This is particularly worrying in the\nabsence of the Strong Supplementation postulate (P.5)\u2014hence the\nextensionality principle (27)\u2014for then the ontological\nexuberance of such theories may yield massive multiplication. But the\nworry is a general one: composition, whether restricted or\nunrestricted, is not an ontologically \u201cinnocent\u201d\noperation.\n\nThere are two lines of response to this worry (whose earliest\nformulations go as far back as V. Lowe 1953). First, it could be\nobserved that the ontological exuberance associated with the relevant\ncomposition principles is not substantive\u2014that the increase of\nentities in the domain of a mereological theory cum\ncomposition principles involves no substantive additional commitments\nbesides those already involved in the underlying theory\nwithout composition. This is obvious in the case of modest\nprinciples in the spirit of (P.11\u03be) and\n(P.14\u03c8), to the effect that all suitably related\nentities must have an upper bound. After all, there are small things\nand there are large things, and to say that we can always find a large\nthing encompassing any given small things of the right sort is not to\nsay much. But the same could be said with respect to those stronger\nprinciples that require the large thing to be composed\nexactly of the small things\u2014to be their mereological\nsum in some sense or other. At least, this seems reasonable in the\npresence of extensionality. For in that case it can be argued that\neven a sum is, in an important sense, nothing over and above\nits constituent parts. The sum is just the parts \u201ctaken\ntogether\u201d (Baxter 1998a: 193); it is the parts \u201ccounted\nloosely\u201d (Baxter 1988b: 580); it is, effectively, \u201cthe\nsame portion of Reality\u201d (Lewis 1991: 81), which is strictly a\nmultitude and loosely a single thing. That's why, if you proceed with\na six-pack of beer to the six-items-or-fewer checkout line at the\ngrocery store, the cashier is not supposed to protest your use of the\nline on the ground that you have seven items: either s/he'll count the\nsix bottles, or s/he'll count the one pack. This thesis, known in the\nliterature as \u201ccomposition as identity\u201d, is by no means\nuncontroversial and admits of different formulations (see van Inwagen\n1994, Yi 1999, Merricks 1999, McDaniel 2008, Berto and Carrara 2009,\nCarrara and Martino 2011, Cameron 2012, Wallace 2013, Cotnoir 2013a,\nHawley 2013, and the essays in Baxter and Cotnoir 2014). To the extent\nthat the thesis is accepted, however, the charge of ontological\nexuberance loses its force. The additional entities postulated by the\nsum axioms would not be a genuine addition to being; they would be, in\nArmstrong's phrase, an \u201contological free lunch\u201d (1997:\n13). In fact, if composition is in some sense a form of identity, then\nthe charge of ontological extravagance discussed in connection with\nunrestricted composition loses its force, too. For if a sum is nothing\nover and above its constituent proper parts, whatever they are, and if\nthe latter are all right, then there is nothing extravagant in\ncountenancing the former: it just is them, whatever they are. (This is\nnot to say that unrestricted composition is entailed by the\nthesis that composition is identity; indeed, see McDaniel 2010 for an\nargument to the effect that it isn't.)\n\nSecondly, it could be observed that the objection in question bites at\nthe wrong level. If, given some entities, positing their sum were to\ncount as further ontological commitment, then, given a mereologically\ncomposite entity, positing its proper parts should also count as\nfurther commitment. After all, every entity is distinct from its\nproper parts. But then the worry has nothing to do with the\ncomposition axioms; it is, rather, a question of whether there is any\npoint in countenancing a whole along with its proper parts or\nvice versa (see Varzi 2000, 2014 and Smid 2015). And if the answer is\nin the negative, then there seems to be little use for mereology\ntout court. From the point of view of the present worry, it\nwould appear that the only thoroughly parsimonious account would be\none that rejects any mereological complex whatsoever.\nPhilosophically such an account is defensible (Rosen and Dorr 2002;\nGrupp 2006; Liggins 2008; Cameron 2010; Sider 2013; Contessa 2014) and\nthe corresponding axiom,\n\n\n(P.20)\nSimplicity\n\nAx, \n\n\nis certainly compatible with M (up to\nEM and more). But the immediate corollary\n\n\n(63)\nPxy \u2194 x=y \n\n\nsays it all: nothing would be part of anything else and parthood would\ncollapse to identity. (This account is sometimes referred to as\nmereological nihilism, in contrast to the mereological\nuniversalism expressed by (P.15i); see\nvan Inwagen 1990:\n 72ff.[25]\n Van Inwagen himself endorses a restricted version of nihilism, which\nleaves room for composite living things. So does Merricks 2000, 2001,\nwhose restricted nihilism leaves room for composite conscious\nthings.)\n\nIn recent years, further worries have been raised concerning\nmereological theories with substantive composition\nprinciples\u2014especially concerning the full strength of\nGEM. Among other things, it has been argued that the\nprinciple of unrestricted composition does not sit well with certain\nfundamental intuitions about persistence through time (van Inwagen\n1990, 75ff), that it is incompatible with certain plausible theories\nof space (Forrest 1996b), or that it leads to paradoxes similar to the\nones afflicting na\u00efve set theory (Bigelow 1996). A detailed\nexamination of such arguments is beyond the scope of this entry. For\nsome discussion of the first issue, however, see Rea (1998), McGrath\n(1998, 2001), Hudson (2001: 93ff) and Eklund (2002: \u00a77). On the\nsecond, see Oppy (1997) and Mormann (1999). Hudson (2001: 95ff) also\ncontains some discussion of the last point.\n",
