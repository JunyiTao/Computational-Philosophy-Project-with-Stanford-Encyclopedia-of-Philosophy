    "main_text": "History of the Philosophical Debate on Substance || Medieval accounts of substance\n2.3 Medieval accounts of substance\n\nThe standard account of the medieval treatment of the topic is that S.\nThomas Aquinas is the only important figure and what he says differs\nlittle from Aristotle, except for making things more rigid and formal.\nIt is clear, however, that this is a serious oversimplification. For a\nmore nuanced and sophisticated view, see Lagerlund (2012), on which\nthis section draws extensively.\n\nOur discussion of Aristotle ended by returning to the issue of the\nunity of substantial form\u2014what is the difference between a\ncollection of \u2018essential\u2019 properties and the form as a\nunitary entity. Various aspects of this issue of the unity of\nsubstantial form preoccupied medieval philosophers. According to\nAquinas, a substance possessed only one form, and its matter was the\nessentially characterless prime matter. In other words the informed\nparts of an object\u2014in the case of a living creature, its organs,\nand the various kinds of stuff that constituted it (in the end,\nquantities of earth, fire, air, and water) did not possess their own\nforms, but were informed by the overall substantial form. Others\ndisagreed. Some of the disagreements were internal to the hylomorphic\nsystem. Duns Scotus, for example, argued that a dead person\u2019s\nbody was the same body as had existed when that person was alive. The\nsoul had departed, so the form that was the immortal soul could not be\nidentical with the form of the body. This argument may seem to be\nspecialised to the case of the human immortal soul, but, presumably, a\nsimilar problem applies to a dead parrot: it has lost its perceptive\nand vegetative souls, yet is the same body\u2014even if it is no\nlonger a parrot.\n\nThis line of thought proved to be a slippery slope, and, as so often,\nthe downward slide was led by William of Ockham. On the one hand,\nOckham was committed to hylomorphism, in that a substance is composed\nof form and matter. But he reverses the priorities of Aquinas and\nScotus by saying that the parts are actual in their own right and do\nnot derive their actuality from the whole: rather, the whole is\nnothing but the sum of its parts. This line of thought opened the way\nto atomism and to treating the unity of wholes as a matter of\nconvention or degree. Buridan, who represents a further development in\nthis direction, says\n\nIn this sense, I am not the same as I was yesterday, because something\nwas part of my integrity yesterday, which has already been used up,\nand something was not part of my integrity, which has meanwhile been\nadded by nourishment. (Buridan, Physics I,q.10, f. xiii;\ncited Lagerlund 2012: 476)\n\n\nIt is clear that this way of thinking paves the way for atomism and\nits associated problems as they emerged in early modern\nphilosophy.\n",
