Epistemology II \u2014 Other Epistemological Doctrines.\n\nAccording to Chisholm, epistemology consists of Socratic inquiry into\nthe questions \u201cWhat can we know?\u201d and \u201cWhat are the\ncriteria of knowledge?\u201d He thought that a puzzle faces anyone\nwho attempts to answer these questions. It appears that to answer the\nfirst question, one needs a criterion to distinguish between things\nthat are known and things that are not known. That is, one needs an\nanswer to the second question. But to have an answer to the second\nquestion, he thought, one needs a list of the things one knows so that\none can identify the features that distinguish knowledge from its\nopposite. That is, one needs an answer to the first question. Lacking\nsuch an answer, Chisholm feared, one would not be in a position to be\nconfident that any proposed criterion of knowledge was correct.\nChisholm calls those who think that they have an answer to the second\nquestion that they can use to answer the first\n\u201cmethodists\u201d and those who think that they have an answer\nto the first question that they can use to answer the second\n\u201cparticularists.\u201d Chisholm himself was a particularist,\nyet he claimed that he had no argument to offer against methodism or\nagainst the view that neither question could be answered without a\nprior answer to the other. In a number of places he said that the\nproblem of the criterion could be answered only by begging the\nquestion.\n\nA final epistemological doctrine for which Chisholm is particularly\nwell-known is internalism. Chisholm characterized internalism in the\nfollowing way: \u2018The internalist assumes that, merely by\nreflecting upon his own conscious state, he can formulate a set of\nepistemic principles that will enable him to find out, with respect to\nany possible belief he has, whether he is justified in having that\nbelief. The epistemic principles that he formulates are principles\nthat one may come upon and apply merely by sitting in one\u2019s\narmchair, so to speak, and without calling for any outside assistance.\nIn a word, one need only consider one\u2019s own state of mind\u2019\n[TK3: 76]. A crucial implication of this doctrine is that people whose\nconscious states are alike must be justified in believing the same\npropositions. Also present in the quoted passage is a related theme\nconcerning the autonomy of epistemology. Chisholm held that\nepistemologists did not need the assistance of the empirical sciences\nin answering their purely epistemological questions. In advancing\nthese doctrines, Chisholm took issue with the externalist and\nnaturalistic theories, such as the causal theory and reliabilism, that\ngained favor with many epistemologists toward the end of\nChisholm\u2019s career.\n",
