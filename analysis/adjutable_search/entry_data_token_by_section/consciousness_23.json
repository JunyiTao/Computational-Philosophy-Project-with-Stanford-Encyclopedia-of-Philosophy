Consciousness of\nthe meta-mental sort may well involve not only an increase in\nself-awareness but also an enhanced understanding of the mental states\nof other minded creatures, especially those of other members of one's\nsocial group (Humphreys 1982). Creatures that are conscious in the\nrelevant meta-mental sense not only have beliefs, motives, perceptions\nand intentions but understand what it is to have such states and are\naware of both themselves and others as having them.\n\n\nThis increase in mutually shared knowledge of each other's minds,\nenables the relevant organisms to interact, cooperate and communicate\nin more advanced and adaptive ways. Although meta-mental consciousness\nis the sort most obviously linked to such a socially coordinative role,\nnarrative consciousness of the kind associated with the stream of\nconsciousness is also clearly relevant in so far as it involves the\napplication to one's own case of the interpretative abilities that\nderive in part from their social application (Ryle 1949, Dennett 1978,\n1992).\n",
