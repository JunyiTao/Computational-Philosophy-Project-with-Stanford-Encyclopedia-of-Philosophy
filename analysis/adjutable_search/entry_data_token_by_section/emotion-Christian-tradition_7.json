Are religious emotions \u201ccognitive\u201d?\n\nBoth Schleiermacher and Otto hold that the most basic religious\nemotions are unsusceptible of propositional definition. Yet both\ntheologians specify, in propositions, the object of the religious\nemotion in question. Our accounts of gratitude, contrition, and\ncompassion have likewise treated the emotions as having a\npropositional structure, one deriving from the teachings of the\nChristian tradition. Let us think for a moment about the sense in\nwhich these emotions are and are not propositional. The Christian\nemotions are given their distinctive character by their doctrinal\ncontent: The three cited prayers expressive of the distinctively\nChristian emotions all trade on propositional beliefs of the kind that\nthe Christian community routinely teaches its members in catechesis.\nThe situation of the emotional subject is then seen (felt) in terms of\nthe teaching; for example, the sufferer on whom the subject has\ncompassion is seen as one for whom Christ died; the object of\ngratitude is seen as a gift from the hand of God; and so forth. The\nparticular character of each religious emotion-type would be\nimpossible apart from this doctrinal content. This is the sense in\nwhich the Christian emotions are propositional. But still, the\nemotions themselves escape reduction to their propositional content\nbecause emotions are a sort of concern-based impression or\nperception or construal of the situation in these\nterms. Emotions transcend propositionality in the same way that any\nactual perception (e.g. visual perception) does. A Rembrandt painting\ncan be truly characterized in many propositions, and in individual\ncases some of the propositions may need to be made explicit as a\ncondition for seeing some things that are in the painting. But no\namount of discourse or discursive thought about the content of the\npainting is a substitute for seeing the painting. This\nimmediate acquaintance with the canvas is analogous to the actual\nhaving of the emotion (religious or otherwise). (For more on the view\nof emotions taken here, see Roberts 2013, chapters 3\u20135; for an\nexcellent discussion of the relationship between religious feelings\nand religious doctrines, see Wynn, 2004, especially chapter 5. For\nmore, and more extended, accounts of particular religious emotions,\nsee Roberts 2007.) So religious emotions are no less propositional\nthan other standard adult human emotions; and like the other emotions,\nthey cannot be reduced to their propositional content.\n\nWhen James says that the religious emotions are just like all other\nemotions in being \u201cmade up of a feeling plus a specific sort of\nobject,\u201d the specific sort of object is just the situational\nobject specified in propositional terms such as the examples in this\narticle have illustrated. But the peculiarity of the Jamesian theory\ncomes in the reference to \u201ca feeling.\u201d The feeling he\nrefers to (1884) is a bodily sensation, which he takes to be the\nelement that makes the mental state into an emotion, and is a\n\u201cquaking of the human breast,\u201d an \u201corganic\nthrill,\u201d or the like. This account of affect seems to many\nto fail to capture the meaning that the object has for the subject\n\u2013 meaning that is conveyed through the emotion. Schleiermacher,\nwith his talk of feeling dependent, and Otto, with his talk of awesome\nmystery, are closer to capturing the kind of affect in question. A\nsensation of quaking or a contraction of the gut are not the same kind\nof thing as the sense that the sufferer before one is a brother for\nwhom Christ died, or that one\u2019s sins are an intolerable burden. There\nmay indeed be organic thrill or quaking, but if so, such sensations\nare incorporated into a perception of personal meaning wrought by the\nsubject\u2019s caring about the object.\n\nJesse Prinz (2004) tries to introduce correct intentionality into the\nJamesian idea that emotional experience is awareness of a gut reaction\nby making the gut reaction indicate the instantiation of a \u201ccore\nrelational theme\u201d. The notion of a core relational theme, which\noriginates with Richard S. Lazarus (1993), is the idea of a way that\nbenefit or harm is mediated to the emotional subject from the\nenvironment. Lazarus gives a list of 15 core relational themes (see\n1993 p. 122), among which are a demeaning offense against me and\nmine (anger), facing uncertain, existential threat\n(anxiety), and having failed to live up to an ego-ideal\n(shame). Such themes seem to be types of events or states of affairs\nthat impinge on some concern of the subject. Prinz envisions the\nsequence that characterizes an emotion episode as follows: An\neliciting event triggers a thought (say, Aaron tells me that my real\nfather is not the man I have taken him all my life to be, but the\nFuller brush man who used to visit the house; which triggers a\ncharacteristic reaction in my gut; which triggers my perception of the\nreaction in my gut; which I read as indicating a core relational\ntheme, namely, a demeaning offense against me and mine; which\ntriggers my socking Aaron in the jaw. But why would the identification\nof my father with the Fuller brush man trigger that reaction in my gut\n(which is characteristic of anger), unless I already heard it as a\ndemeaning offense against me and mine? Prinz\u2019s construction seems to\nmisplace the gut reaction in the emotional process. The gut reaction\nseems, rather, to presuppose some emotional awareness of the\ncore relational theme, which gives rise to the gut reaction (for\ndiscussion, see Roberts 2013, 73\u201375).\n\nMark Wynn (2013, 27\u201333) points out that in James\u2019s\ndiscussion of religious emotion, it is not the gut reaction that is\nprimarily felt, but a sensory awareness of \u201cthe world\u201d\nunder a certain description. In other words, religious feelings are\ninstances of what Peter Goldie (2000) calls\n\u201cfeeling-towards\u201d. And in still other words, the James\nof The Varieties of Religious Experience isn\u2019t a\nJamesian in the standard sense. As Wynn points out, it doesn\u2019t\nfollow from religious emotions\u2019 not being primarily gut\nreactions that gut reactions are not involved in their phenomenology;\nbut their involvement would be in the nature of a feedback loop or\nintegrated non-focal awareness. I would also add that, while gut\nsensations are frequently included in the phenomenology of emotions,\nthey may not be necessary or universal.  James himself, in a\npostscript to his 1884 article, cites the case of a 15-year-old\nshoemaker\u2019s apprentice who, being entirely without bodily\nsensations (though otherwise aware of the world around him),\nnevertheless exhibited shame, grief, fear, and anger, as his situation\nwarranted. In acknowledgment of the possibility of emotions without\nbodily sensations, the Jamesian neuroscientist Antonio Damasio (1994)\nposits the existence of an \u201cas-if\u201d bodily feedback loop in\nthe brain to provide for the \u201csomatic markers\u201d required,\non the theory, by emotions.\n",
