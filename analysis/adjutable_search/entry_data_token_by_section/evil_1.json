    "main_text": "Some Important Distinctions || Incompatibility Formulations versus Inductive Formulations\n1.2 Incompatibility Formulations versus Inductive Formulations\n\n\nThe argument from evil focuses upon the fact that the world appears\nto contain states of affairs that are bad, or undesirable, or that\nshould have been prevented by any being that could have done so, and\nit asks how the existence of such states of affairs is to be squared\nwith the existence of God.  But the argument can be formulated in two\nvery different ways.  First, it can be formulated as a purely\ndeductive argument that attempts to show that there are certain facts\nabout the evil in the world that are logically incompatible with the\nexistence of God.  One especially ambitious form of this first sort\nof argument attempts to establish the very strong claim that it is\nlogically impossible for it to be the case both that there is any\nevil at all, and that God exists.  The argument set out in the\npreceding section is just such an argument.\n\nAlternatively, rather than being formulated as a deductive argument\nfor the very strong claim that it is logically impossible for both\nGod and evil to exist, (or for God and certain types, or instances,\nor a certain amount of evil to exist), the argument from evil can\ninstead be formulated as an evidential (or inductive/probabilistic)\nargument for the more modest claim that there are evils that actually\nexist in the world that make it unlikely\u2014or perhaps very \nunlikely\u2014that God exists.\n\nThe choice between incompatibility formulations and evidential\nformulations is discussed below, in section 2.\n",
