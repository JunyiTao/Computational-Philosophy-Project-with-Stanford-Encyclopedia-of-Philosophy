    "main_text": "Epistemology\n5. Epistemology\n\nAs in early\n Mohist thought,\n the focus of later Mohist epistemology is not on the justification or\ntruth of beliefs, or propositional attitudes, but on knowing how to\ndistinguish which things or situations are sh\u00ec\n\u662f (this) for some term and which are f\u0113i \u975e\n(not-this). As in the earlier texts, the core expression of knowledge\nis knowing how to apply terms to things correctly. However, the\nDialectics identifies new aspects of knowledge to explain\ncases such as when someone is able to make a correct assertion about\nsomething but not to identify it perceptually or when someone can\nrecognize a thing under one name but not another. \n\nThe core of later Mohist epistemology is presented in two places, a\ngroup of canons describing basic cognitive functions (A3\u20136) and\nanother canon listing sources and types of knowledge (A80). It is not\nentirely clear how, or whether, the doctrines presented in the two\nplaces fit together as a system. (The texts make no attempt to link\nthe two, and Canon A80 treats aspects of knowledge that do not mesh\ndirectly with the account in A3\u2013A6.) But they do give a\nreasonably informative picture of the later Mohists\u2019 approach to\nknowledge. \n",
