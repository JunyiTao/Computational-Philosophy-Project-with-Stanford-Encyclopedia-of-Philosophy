Co-construction of Meaning: Towards Dynamic, Interactional Defaults\n\nIt is not a new observation that interlocutors can have collective, or\njoint, intentions in communication. Joint construction of meaning has\nbeen attended to in approaches as different as game theory (Lewis\n1979; Parikh 2010), action theory (Searle 1990) and conversation\nanalysis (Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson 1974). But it is only more\nrecently that the joint construction (or co-construction) of meaning\nhas begun to come to the forefront of pragmatics tout court.\nFor example, Arundale\u2019s so-called Conjoint Co-constituting Model\nof Communication focuses on the interactive construction of\nimplicatures (Arundale 1999, 2010; Haugh 2007, 2008; Haugh and\nJaszczolt 2012). Next, Elder and Haugh (2018) propose a model of\ncomplex inferential work, continuing for several conversational turns,\nthat can account for mismatches between the expected and the actual\ninferences, as well as for the fact that speakers may not have precise\nintentions while issuing an utterance and be open to negotiating\nmeaning. These aspects of communication had often been neglected, or\neven denied, in post-Gricean research.\n\nIt is no surprise that understanding communication as emergent\nmeanings, as negotiating intentions and commitments (see e.g., Geurts\n2019; Elder 2021) is taking the concept of default to the new\nterritory of dynamic, co-constructed meanings. Elder and Haugh, for\nexample, aim at modelling the joint construction of the meaning that\nis settled on by the interlocutors as the main content \u2013 as they\nsay, akin to the \u2018primary meaning\u2019 of Default Semantics\n(Jaszczolt 2005) or to Ariel\u2019s (2002) \u2018privileged\ninteractional interpretation\u2019 \u2013 free from any formal\nconstraints that the logical form of the uttered sentence might\nimpose, but instead, and in addition, flowing freely, as conversation\nprogresses, with dynamic, changing intentions. Such co-constructed\nmeaning is steered by default interpretations that are assigned\nprivately by each side but also sometimes rejected in favour of what\nprogressively emerges as a default inference \u2013 an interactively\nconstructed meaning that is sensitive to what is fit to be taken for\ngranted, and as such sensitive to what other parties would, and do,\ntake for granted. In short, dynamic, interactional pragmatics comes\nwith dynamic, interactional defaults.\n",
