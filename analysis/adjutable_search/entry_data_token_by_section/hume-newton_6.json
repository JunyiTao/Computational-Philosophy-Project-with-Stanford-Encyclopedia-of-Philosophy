    "main_text": "In What Sense Was Hume a Newtonian? || Causation\n4.4 Causation\n\nIn\n section 3,\n we saw that Hume rejected Newtonian forces as real causes; he argues\nthat we must reinterpret forces and powers as being ideas about\neffects (see also Hazony 2014; Hazony & Schliesser 2016). In that\nsection no reference to Hume\u2019s widely discussed views on\ncausation was made. In this section Hume\u2019s account of causation\nis analyzed. Given our focus on the Hume-Newton relationship no stance\non the most controversial issue in Hume scholarship are taken: are\ncauses mere (psychological) regularity or are they found in nature.\nHowever, recall that Hume insists that \n\n\nIt was never the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob second causes of\nall force or energy; though some of his followers have endeavoured to\nestablish that theory upon his authority. (footnote at EHU 7.1.25)\n\n\n\nSo Hume\u2019s Newton accepts some real causes in nature.\n\nHume\u2019s account of causality covers at least five related issues:\n(1) how we acquire an idea of cause; (2) what we mean by\n\u201ccause;\u201d (3) how we reason about causes; (4) whether\ncauses are in the mind or in nature; (5) how we could infer the\nexistence of causes. In this section, we explore how Hume\u2019s\ntreatment of what we mean by \u201ccause\u201d illustrates\nHume\u2019s critical response to and departure from Newton\u2019s\nphilosophy (see also Schliesser 2007). Hume\u2019s treatment of\ncausation straightforwardly rejects at least two kinds of causes that\nappear in Newton\u2019s philosophy: final causes and simultaneous\ncauses (Schliesser 2009). Moreover, we show that the structure of\nHumean causes is deeply indebted to the Pre-Newtonian mechanical\nphilosophy associated with Boyle.\n\nHume analyzes how \u201cour\u201d notion of causality\u2014one\napplying to events that are contiguous, exhibit temporal priority of\nthe cause, and have constant conjunction (THN 1.3, Sections 2, 6, and\n15)\u2014is derived from experiencing constant conjunction of objects\nthat produce a union in the imagination (THN 1.3.6.16). Hume\u2019s\naccount is causal in its own terms, that is, his two definitions of\nthe meaning of \u201ccause\u201d (THN 1.3.14.31) are patterned on\nthe chain of events that he thinks lead people to acquire the idea of\ncause. Hume\u2019s analysis is a first approximation of and unifies\nwhat \u201cModerns\u201d tend to mean by \u201ccausation\u201d. In\nhis hands, a redefined version of Aristotelian \u201cefficient\ncausation\u201d is the only kind of causation available for use (THN\n1.3.14.32). There is, thus, a stipulative quality to Hume\u2019s\ndiscussion (see also the treatment of his Rules of Reasoning, THN\n1.3.15 discussed in\n section 4.5).\n One of the tacit targets of Hume\u2019s approach is Newton. For\nHume\u2019s treatment of causation rules out the permissibility of\nNewton\u2019s appeal to \u201cfinal causes\u201d in the\njustification of the (inductive and probable) argument from design in\nthe \u201cGeneral Scholium\u201d of the Principia:\n\u201cwe know [the Deity] only by his most wise and excellent\ncontrivances of things, and final causes\u201d (for discussion, see\nStein 2002).\n\nMoreover, while Hume and Newton both appeal to the authority of\n\u201cexperience\u201d, there are further serious tensions between\nHume\u2019s account of causation and the contents of Newton\u2019s\nnatural philosophy. For Newton, the behavior of the moon in its orbit\nand that of, say, apples falling on the earth have the same cause:\nnamely, the force of gravity, or weight, towards the earth\n(Principia, Book III, Scholium to Proposition IV, Theorem\nIV). This conflicts with the contiguity requirement, which Hume\nconsiders \u201cessential\u201d to \u201ccausation\u201d (THN 1.3.2.6).\nIt is hard to see how contiguity could be made consistent with the\nuniversal nature of attraction. The most distant particles of the\nuniverse attract each other. (The contiguity requirement notably\ndisappears in EHU.) More important, according to Newton the\nacceleration produced by the exercise of a force is simultaneous with\nthat exercise\u2014thus defying temporal priority (Smeenk &\nSchliesser 2013). Hume claims that temporal priority of the cause is\n\u201cof no great importance\u201d (THN 1.3.2.8), yet it appears\nexplicitly or implicitly throughout his treatment of causation. Be\nthat as it may, Hume explicitly attacks the possibility of an effect\nbeing simultaneous with its cause (THN 1.3.2.7\u20138; Ryan\n2003).\n\nFinally, there is a fundamental structural similarity between Humean\ncauses and the causes favored by pre-Newtonian Mechanical philosophers\n(i.e., Boyle, Huygens, etc; for a different argument, see McGuire\n1972). They have the same structure: i.e., priority of the cause over\nthe effect, contiguity, and constant conjunction. Now, to be sure,\nHume is aware that Newton decisively refuted the Mechanical\nPhilosophy\u2019s program which insisted that explanations be cast in\nterms of the impact of colliding bodies\n (section 4.2).\n Hume rejects the ontological and explanatory reductionism of the\nMechanical philosophy. Hume introduces eight \u201crules by which to\njudge of causes and effects\u201d (see\n section 4.5\n below) because it is \u201cpossible for all objects to become causes\nor effects to each other\u201d (THN 1.3.15). This is why Hume\u2019s\nlist of \u201cultimate causes\u201d and \u201cgeneral\nprinciples\u201d\u2014\u201cElasticity, gravity, cohesion of parts,\ncommunication of motion by impulse\u201d (EHU 4.1.12)\u2014is more\ninclusive than the Mechanical philosophy would allow.\n\nSo, even if we leave aside the controversial question to what degree\nHume would allow the existence and our potential knowledge of real\ncauses in nature (as discussed in the \u201cnew Hume\u201d debate),\nhis analysis of what we mean by \u201ccause\u201d is hostile to\nNewtonian natural philosophy. Hume rules out final and simultaneous\ncauses. The former play only a role in Newton\u2019s theology and\nnatural religion, but the latter are an integral part of what we could\nhis \u201cscience\u201d.\n",
