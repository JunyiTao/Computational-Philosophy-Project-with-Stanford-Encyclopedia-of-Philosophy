    "main_text": "Do works of art exist? || Realism\n1.1 Realism\n\n\nOne prevalent response to the question of art\u2019s existence is a\nstraightforward realism to the effect that works of art figure amongst\nthose entities that, once they have been brought into existence, do\nnot depend on anyone\u2019s (actual or possible) beliefs or\nresponses. Assuming that something can only be discovered if it\nalready exists, a striking example of a realist statement is Samuel\nAlexander\u2019s claim that \u201cShakespeare\ndiscovered Hamlet in the English language the way the\nsculptor discovers his figure in the block\u201d (1925, 28). A more\nprominent example of a philosopher who defends realism about works of\nart is Monroe C. Beardsley (1958), who seems to have espoused the\ndisjunctive thesis that a work of art is either a particular physical\nobject or a kind of physical object (see the entry on\nBeardsley\u2019s aesthetics). Various other options for realism about\nartworks will be mentioned below.\n",
