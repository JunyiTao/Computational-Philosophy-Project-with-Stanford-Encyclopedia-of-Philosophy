    "main_text": "Contours of Pure Land Buddhist Thought || Seeds of Pure Land Thought in the Bodhisattva Path\n2.2 Seeds of Pure Land Thought in the Bodhisattva Path\n\nThe path of realization based on the Mahayana conception of genuine\nwisdom was elaborated as the career of the bodhisattva. As described\nin Mahayana sutras, it begins with the profound awakening of the mind\naspiring for enlightenment (bodhicitta), the determination to\nbecome a buddha whatever hardships one may encounter over the course\nof many lifetimes of endeavor. This unshakable resolution is declared\nin the presence of a buddha in formal vows, and typically, the\nbodhisattva receives from the buddha a prophesy foretelling eventual\nfulfillment of those vows. A standard element of such individual vows\nis the establishment, through their vast accumulation of merit through\npraxis, of a buddha land or field of influence\n(buddhak\u1e63etra), which is understood as giving concrete\nmanifestation both to the splendor of their attainment and to their\nactivity to bring beings to enlightenment.\n\nThe bodhisattva then embarks upon the practices and disciplines, to be\ncontinued through countless lifetimes, that will finally result in\nfulfillment. It is said that vast aeons\u2014\u201cthree great\ninnumerable kalpas\u201d\u2014are required for the completion of a\nbodhisattva\u2019s practices (the inconceivable stretches of time may\nbe understood as expressing the depths of a being\u2019s evil karma\nto be eradicated and the preciousness of enlightenment). The process\nof practice has been formulated in a scheme of ten stages, in which\nthe most crucial is the stage of nonretrogression, the first (or in\nsome formats, the seventh). While prior to reaching this stage, they\nwill fall back into samsaric existence if they discontinue their\npractice, once they have attained nonretrogression through stilling\ntheir discriminative thought and seeing suchness, they will never\nregress but steadily advance in their practice to supreme\nawakening.\n\nAlthough Pure Land Buddhism is sometimes understood to teach a\nparadisial afterlife, in fact it developed as a method for achieving\nnonretrogression, one that provided an alternative to the arduous\nendeavor through numerous lifetimes required for reaching this stage\nin the earlier formulations of the bodhisattva path. As practitioners\nfound themselves without enlightened guidance in a world increasingly\ndistant from the benign influence of a buddha\u2019s presence, the\nobstacles to successful practice loomed ever larger and practitioners\ncame to seek a practicable way to advance. The possibility of entrance\ninto an environment that would support one\u2019s efforts in\nbodhisattva practices emerged, and on the basis of the Pure Land\nsutras, the concepts of the bodhisattva path were recast to render a\nnew understanding of the nature of practice.\n",
