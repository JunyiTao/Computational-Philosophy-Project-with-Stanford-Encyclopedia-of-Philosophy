    "main_text": "The Ruler || Entrapped Sovereign?\n5.2 Entrapped Sovereign?\n\nThe fa thinkers\u2019 image as staunch endorses of autocracy\nbecomes qualified once we note their unflattering view of real-life\nrulers. The Book of Lord Shang and Han Feizi\nrepeatedly refer to \u201ccontemporary sovereigns\u201d\n(shizhu \u4e16\u4e3b) as epitome of shortsightedness and\nmediocrity. This is not accidental. The fa\nthinkers\u2014much like their intellectual rivals\u2014realized that\nthe system of hereditary succession could not normally produce\nbrilliant leaders. Accordingly, their expectations of the rulers were\nlow. Take for instance many dozens of historical anecdotes scattered\nthroughout Han Feizi, which repeatedly tell not just about\nimprudent rulers who were duped by unscrupulous underlings, but also\nabout those who dismissed good advice of their aides and brought about\ndisaster on themselves and their states. These anecdotes problematize,\nif not outright subvert the text\u2019s habitual sidelining with the\nruler against his ministers. Han Fei is \u201cobliged to integrate\nthe unavoidable fact of absolute submission to an individual who is\nmore often than not totally unqualified for the exercise of supreme\ncommand\u201d (Graziani 2015: 162).\n\nHow to resolve this quagmire? The fa thinkers hesitate.\nSometimes they speak of an ideal of a \u201csage\u201d\n(sheng \u8056) or \u201cclear-sighted\u201d\n(ming \u660e, often translated as\n\u201cenlightened\u201d) sovereign. In a few of Han Feizi\nchapters, the thinker apparently recommends to subject the ruler to\n\u201crigorous intellectual self-cultivation\u201d (Lewis,\nforthcoming). Overall, however, the idea of personal self-cultivation\nas a solution to political problems remains alien to fa\ntexts. An alternative, better attuned to fa ideology, is to\nrely on perfectly designed political institutions that would\naccommodate mediocrities on the throne. This point is explicit in\nchapter 40, \u201cObjections to position power,\u201d of Han\nFeizi. Han Fei explains that the system he designs should cater\nto the need of average or mediocre (zhong \u4e2d) rulers,\nneither moral paragons, nor monstrous tyrants. This system will attain\ngood results precisely because it does not expect of the ruler any\nextraordinary qualities (Pines 2020a). Guanzi further\nclarifies:\n\n\nThe sage ruler relies on laws, not on personal wisdom; on methods and\nnot on persuasions; on impartiality and not on selfishness; on the\ngreat Way and not on trivial matters. Then, he may be at ease and\nAll-under-Heaven will be governed well. (Guanzi 45,\n\u201cRelying on law\u201d; cf. Ricket 1998: 144)\n\n\nThe text ostensibly speaks of a sage ruler, but the sagacity of this\nruler is manifested in following impartial norms and discarding his\nown abilities, as well as the persuaders\u2019 talks. Time and again,\nthe ruler is warned that he should never allow his personal whims,\nfavoritism, likes and dislikes to influence decision making. Instead\nhe should inviolably follow laws, methods (shu \u6578),\ntechniques of rule, and other impartial norms. His personality should\nhave no impact at all on the state\u2019s functioning. This is the\nbottom line of \u201cbeing at ease\u201d: the ruler simply should\navoid intervention in quotidian government affairs.\n\nThe latter point elucidates a major but less frequently noted aspect\nof the fa views of rulership. The same texts that insist that\nthe ruler should preserve firmly the right to issue final decisions,\nto supervise his officials\u2019 performance, to reward and\npunish\u2014are equally adamant that he should never interfere in\neveryday political matters. This depersonalization of the sovereign\npeaks in Han Feizi. Time and again the text insists that the\nruler should eschew any expression of personal emotions, cast away\npersonal desires, avoid manifestations of favoritism, and not trust\nhis personal abilities. The thinker summarizes:\n\n\nThe way of a clear-sighted ruler: Let the wise completely exhaust\ntheir contemplations and rely on them to decide on matters\u2014then\nthe ruler is not depleted of wisdom. Let the worthy utilize their\ntalents and rely on them and assign task accordingly\u2014then the\nruler is not depleted of abilities. When there is success, the ruler\npossesses a worthy [name]; when there is failure, the minister bears\nthe responsibility. Thus the ruler is not depleted of a [good] name.\nHence, being unworthy, he is the master of the worthies; being unwise,\nhe is the corrector of the wise. The minister works, while the ruler\npossesses the achievements: this is called the foundations of the\nworthy sovereign. (Han Feizi 5.1, \u201cThe way of the\nsovereign\u201d)\n\n\nThis passage is somewhat ironic. Whereas the ruler is referred to as\n\u201cclear-sighted,\u201d he is also presumed to be potentially\nunworthy and unwise. By dispensing with any manifestation of personal\ninclinations and abilities, the ruler benefits twice. First (as\ndiscussed in an earlier part of the cited passage), he avoids the\ntraps of scheming ministers; and second, he is able to manipulate them\nand achieve undeserved glory and fame. The latter promise\u2014an\nunabashed appeal to the ruler\u2019s selfishness\u2014should lure\nhim into adopting Han Fei\u2019s recommendations. Hinting at the\npossibility that the sovereign, albeit unworthy and unwise, will\nbecome the teacher and corrector of his worthy subjects, Han Fei again\ndiscloses his ultimately low expectations of the monarch\u2019s\nmorality and wisdom. This qualifies the text\u2019s constant\ninvocations of a \u201cclear-sighted sovereign.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is puzzling. The ruler is supposed to be clever enough\nto make fateful decisions and monitor his scheming officials; but\nsimultaneously he is constantly dissuaded from trusting his own\nabilities and intervening in political processes. Graham provocatively\nconcludes that the ruler in Han Fei\u2019s system \u201chas no\nfunctions which could not be performed by an elementary computer.\n\u2026 Might one even say than in Han Fei\u2019s system it is\nministers who do the ruling?\u201d (Graham 1989: 291). Indeed, there\nare a few chapters in which Han Fei seems to put his hopes on worthy\nministers (Pines 2013b), but these chapters are contradicted by\nothers, which define the ministers as the ruler\u2019s worst foes.\nThe ruler remains alone in his woes.\n\nThis paradox of an entrapped sovereign, who enjoys God-like\nomnipotence, but who is required to refrain from any activism in order\nto preserve this omnipotence may reflect Han Fei\u2019s understanding\nof the perennial weakness of the system in which a\nsingle\u2014potentially inept\u2014individual plays the superhuman\nrole. That this sober understanding came from a thinker dubbed\n\u201cthe most sophisticated theoretician of autocracy\u201d (Wang\nand Chang 1986:12) deserves utmost attention.\n",
