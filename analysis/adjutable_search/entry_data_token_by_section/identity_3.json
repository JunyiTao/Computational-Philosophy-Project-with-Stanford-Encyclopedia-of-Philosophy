Criteria of identity\n\nA notion that Geach deploys extensively, and which is also in common\nuse by his opponents, is that of a criterion of identity, a standard\nby which identity is to be judged. This section will attempt to\nuntangle some of the complexities this notion involves.\n\nThe notion of a criterion of identity was introduced into\nphilosophical terminology by Frege (1884) and strongly emphasised by\nWittgenstein (1958). Exactly how it is to be interpreted and the\nextent of its applicability are still matters of debate.\n\nA considerable obstacle to understanding contemporary philosophical\nusage of the term, however, is that the notion does not seem to be a\nunitary one. In the case of abstract objects (the case discussed by\nFrege) the criterion of identity for Fs is thought of as an\nequivalence relation holding between objects distinct from\nFs. Thus the criterion of identity for directions is\nparallelism of lines, that is, the direction of line\na is identical with the direction of line b if and\nonly if line a is parallel to line b. The criterion\nof identity for numbers is equinumerosity of concepts, that\nis, the number of As is identical with the number of\nBs if and only if there are exactly as many As as\nBs. The relation between the criterion of identity for\nFs and the criterion of application for the concept\nF (the standard for the application of the concept to an\nindividual) is then said by some (Wright and Hale 2001) to be that to\nbe an F is just to be something for which questions of\nidentity and distinctness are to settled by appeal to the criterion of\nidentity for Fs. (Thus, when Frege went on to give an\nexplicit definition of numbers as extensions of concepts he appealed\nto it only to deduce what has come to be called Hume\u2019s Principle\n\u2013 his statement of his criterion of identity for numbers in\nterms of equinumerosity of concepts, and emphasised that he regarded\nthe appeal to extensions as inessential.) In the case of concrete\nobjects, however, things seem to stand differently. Often the\ncriterion of identity for a concrete object of type F is said\nto be a relation R such that for any Fs, x\nand y, x=y if and only if Rxy. In\nthis case the criterion of identity for Fs is not stated as a\nrelation between entities distinct from Fs and the criterion\nof identity cannot plausibly be thought of as determining the\ncriterion of application. Another example of the lack of uniformity in\nthe notion of a criterion of identity in contemporary philosophy is,\nin the case of concrete objects, a distinction customarily made\nbetween a criterion of diachronic identity and a criterion of\nsynchronic identity; the former taking the form \u201cx is\nat t the same F as y is at\nt\u2032 if and only if\u2026\u201d, where what fills the\ngap is some statement of a relation holding between objects x\nand y and times t and t\u2032. (In the\ncase of persons, for example, a candidate criterion of diachronic\nidentity is: x is at t the same person as y\nis at t\u2032 if and only if x at t is\npsychologically continuous with y at t\u2032.) A\ncriterion of synchronic identity, by contrast, will typically specify\nhow the parts of an F-thing existing at a time must be\nrelated, or how one F at a time is marked off from\nanother.\n\nOne way of bringing system into the discussion of criteria of identity\nis to make use of the distinction between one-level and two-level\ncriteria of identity (Williamson 1990, Lowe 2012). The Fregean\ncriteria of identity for directions and numbers are two-level. The\nobjects for which the criterion is given are distinct from, and can be\npictured as at a higher level than, the entities between which the\nrelation specified holds. A two-level criterion for the Fs\ntakes the form (restricting ourselves to examples in which the\ncriterial relation holds between objects):\n\nIf x is a G and y is a G then\nd(x) = d(y) iff Rxy\n\n\ne.g., If x and y are lines then the direction of\nx is identical with the direction of y iff\nx and y are parallel.\n\nA two-level criterion of identity is thus in the first place an\nimplicit definition of a function \u201cd(\u2009)\u201d\n(e.g., \u201cthe direction of\u201d) in terms of which the sortal\npredicate \u201cis an F\u201d can be defined (\u201cis a\ndirection\u201d can be defined as \u201cis the direction of some\nline\u201d). Consistently with the two-level criterion of identity\nstated several distinct functions may be the reference of the functor\n\u201cd\u201d. Hence, as emphasised by Lowe (1997: section\n6), two-level criteria of identity are neither definitions of\nidentity, nor of identity restricted to a certain sort (for identity\nis universal), nor even of the sortal terms denoting the sorts for\nwhich they provide criteria. They merely constrain, but not to\nuniqueness, the possible referents of the functor \u201cd\u201d they\nimplicitly define and they thus give a merely necessary condition for\nfalling under the sortal predicate \u201cis an F\u201d\n(where \u201cx is an F\u201d is explained to mean\n\u201cfor some y, x is identical with\nd(y)\u201d).\n\nOn the other hand, the criterion of identity for sets given by the\nAxiom of Extensionality (sets are the same iff they have the same\nmembers), unlike the criterion of identity for numbers given by\nHume\u2019s Principle, and Davidson\u2019s criterion of event\nidentity (events are the same iff they have the same causes and\neffects (\u201cThe Individuation of Events\u201d in his 1980)) are\none-level: the objects for which the criterion of identity is stated\nare the same as those between which the criterial relation obtains. In\ngeneral, a one-level criterion for objects of sort F takes\nthe form:\n\nIf x is an F and y is an F then\nx=y iff Rxy\n\n\nNot all criteria of identity can be two-level (on pain of infinite\nregress), and it is tempting to think that the distinction between\nobjects for which a two-level criterion is possible and those for\nwhich only a one-level criterion is possible coincides with that\nbetween abstract and concrete objects (and so, that a two-level\ncriterion for sets must be possible).\n\nHowever, a more general application of the two-level notion is\npossible. In fact, it can be applied to any type of object K,\nsuch that the criterion of identity for Ks can be thought of\nas an equivalence relation between a distinct type of object,\nK*s, but some such objects may intuitively be regarded as\nconcrete.\n\nHow general this makes its application is a matter of controversy. In\nparticular, if persisting things are thought of as composed of\n(instantaneous) temporal parts (see discussion below), the problem of\nsupplying a diachronic criterion of identity for persisting concrete\nobjects can be regarded as the problem of providing a two-level\ncriterion. But if persisting things are not thought of in this way\nthen not all persisting things can be provided with two-level\ncriteria. (Though some can. For example, it is quite plausible that\nthe criterion of identity over time for persons should be thought of\nas given by a relation between bodies.)\n\nAs noted by Lowe (1997) and Wright and Hale (2001) any two-level\ncriterion can be restated in a one-level form (though, of course, not\nconversely). For example, to say that the direction of line a\nis identical with the direction of line b if and only if line\na is parallel to line b is to say that directions\nare the same if and only if the lines they are of are parallel, which\nis the form of a one-level criterion. A way of unifying the various\ndifferent ways of talking of criteria of identity is thus to take as\nthe paradigmatic form of a statement of a criterion of identity a\nstatement of the form: for any x, for any y, if\nx is an F and y is an F then\nx=y if and only if Rxy (Lowe 1989,\n1997).\n\nIf the notion is interpreted in this way then the relation between the\ncriterion of identity and the criterion of application will be that of\none-way determination. The criterion of identity will be determined\nby, but not determine, the criterion of application.\n\nFor, in general, a one-level criterion of identity for Fs as\nexplained above is equivalent to the conjunction of:\n\nIf x is an F then Rxx\n and\n\n\nIf x is an F then if y is an F and\nRxy then x=y\n\n\nEach of these gives a merely necessary condition for being an\nF. And the second says something about Fs which is\nnot true of everything only if \u201cRxy\u201d does not\nentail \u201cx=y\u201d\n\nTogether these are equivalent to the proposition that every F\nis the F \u201cR-related\u201d to it. By its form\nthis states a merely necessary condition for being a thing of sort\n\u201cF\u201d. The one-level criterion of identity thus\nagain merely specifies a necessary condition of being an object of\nsort \u201cF\u201d.\n\nHence, once the necessary and sufficient conditions of being an\n\u201cF\u201d are laid down, no further stipulation is\nrequired of a criterion of \u201cF\u201d-identity, whether\none-level or two-level.\n\nThis conclusion is, of course, in agreement with Lewis\u2019s view\nthat there are no genuine problems about identity as such (Lewis 1986,\nCh. 4), but it is in tension with the thought that sortal concepts, as\ndistinct from adjectival concepts, are to be characterised by their\ninvolvement of criteria of identity as well as criteria of\napplication.\n\nA conception of identity criteria which allows this characterisation\nof the notion of a sortal concept, and which has so far not been\nmentioned, is that of Dummett (1981). Dummett denies that a criterion\nof identity must always be regarded as a criterion of identity for a\ntype of object. There is a basic level, he suggests, at which\nwhat a criterion of identity is a criterion of, is the truth of a\nstatement in which no objects are referred to. Such a\nstatement can be expressed using demonstratives and pointing gestures,\nfor instance, by saying \u201cThis is the same cat as that\u201d,\npointing first to a head and then a tail. In such a statement, which\nhe calls a statement of identification, in Dummett\u2019s view, there\nneed be no reference to objects made by the use of the demonstratives,\nany more than reference is made to any object in a feature-placing\nsentence like \u201cIt\u2019s hot here\u201d. A statement of\nidentification is merely, as it were, a feature-placing relational\nstatement, like \u201cThis is darker than that\u201d. A grasp of a\nsortal concept F involves both grasp of the truth-conditions\nof such statements of identification involving\n\u201cF\u201d and also grasp of the truth-conditions of\nwhat Dummett calls \u201ccrude predications\u201d involving\n\u201cF\u201d, statements of the form \u201cthis is\nF\u201d, in which the demonstrative again does not serve to\nrefer to any object. Adjectival terms, which have only a criterion of\napplication and no criterion of identity, are ones which have a use in\nsuch crude predications, but no use in statements of identification.\nSortal terms, as just noted, have a use in both contexts, and sortal\nterms may share their criteria of application but differ in their\ncriteria of identity since grasp of the truth-conditions of the crude\npredication \u201cThis is F\u201d does not determine grasp\nof the truth-conditions of the statement of identification \u201cThis\nis the same F as that\u201d (thus I can know when it is\nright to say \u201cThis is a book\u201d without knowing when it is\nright to say \u201cThis is the same book as that\u201d).\n\nOn Dummett\u2019s account, then, it may be possible to accept that\nwhenever a criterion of identity for a type of object is to\nbe given it must be (expressible as) a two-level criterion, which\nimplicitly defines a functor. Essentially one-level criteria\n(one-level criteria not expressible in a two-level form) are\nredundant, determined by specifications of necessary and sufficient\nconditions for being objects of the sorts in question.\n",
