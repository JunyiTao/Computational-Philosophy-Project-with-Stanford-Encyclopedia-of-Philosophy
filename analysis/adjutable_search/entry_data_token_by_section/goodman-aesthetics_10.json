    "main_text": "From Languages of Art to Reconceptions: New Looks at Aesthetic Issues || Artistic Style\n4.6 The Question of the Aesthetic and the Question of Merit\n\nGoodman\u2019s conclusions, on what roughly could be considered the\nquestion of what is art as well as on the question of artistic value,\nfollow from his view that aesthetics is really a branch of\nepistemology and that there is ultimately no sharp division between\nart and other forms of human knowledge.\n\nThe aims of art are the aims of symbolic activity in general, and they\nhave to do with understanding. (Understanding is, for\nGoodman, a broader concept than knowledge, one that is not bound by\nliteral truth, and that is thus applicable also to the literally false\nand to what admits of no truth value: metaphors and paintings for\nexample.) Artistic symbols, as symbols in general, are to be judged\nfor the classifications they bring about, for how novel and insightful\nthose categorizations are, for how they change our perception of the\nworld and relations to it. The cognitive value of art counts as\nartistic merit only because the symbols involved and the\nexperiences they bring about belong in some sense to what Goodman\nrefers to as \u201cthe aesthetic.\u201d Hence, the question of when\nsuch symbolic activities and experiences are aesthetic or artistic is\nimportant, although, for Goodman, more in order to recognize the\ncommonalities between art and other human activities, including\nscience, than to isolate the artistic or aesthetic realm from other\nareas of knowledge and experience. \n\nGoodman proposes no definition of art nor of what makes an experience\naesthetic. Since to be a work of art is, for Goodman, to perform\ncertain referential functions, the question \u201cWhat is art?\u201d\nshould be replaced with the question \u201cWhen is art?\u201d. That\nis, the real issue is to know when, typically at least, the symbolic\nactivity in question has features that bring us to call it\n\u201cartistic.\u201d Hence, he suggests the existence of\nsymptoms of the aesthetic, i.e., symbol systems\u2019\ncharacteristics that tend to occur in art. In Languages of\nArt, they were tentatively presented as conjunctively sufficient\nand disjunctively necessary for an experience to be aesthetic. There\nGoodman indicated four of such symptoms: syntactic density,\nsemantic density, syntactic repleteness, and\nexemplificationality (1976, 252\u2013255). In Ways of\nWorldmaking, the list is enriched by a fifth element:\nmultiple and complex reference (Goodman 1978a, 67\u201368).\nIn his later contribution that those are only symptoms seems to be\ntaken even more literally: they are clues that indicate but do not\nguarantee the presence of a work of art; and artistic status is\npossible even without them. In other words, Goodman\u2019s tentative\nclaims on this issue point to symbolic activities and features of\nsymbolic activity that artworks tend to instantiate. On these\ngrounds, Goodman can once again claim that \u201c[a]rt and science\nare not altogether alien\u201d (1976, 255). The same features that\nare characteristic, for instance, of numerical calculation\u2014e.g.,\narticulateness\u2014can be found in musical scores, and the same\nfeatures that could be called aesthetic\u2014such as\nexemplification\u2014can be found in scientific hypotheses as well.\nIn a more complete statement: \u201cThe difference between art and\nscience is not that between feeling and fact, intuition and inference,\ndelight and deliberation, synthesis and analysis, sensation and\ncerebration, concreteness and abstraction, passion and action, mediacy\nand immediacy, or truth and beauty, but rather a difference in\ndomination of certain specific characteristics of symbols\u201d\n(Goodman 1976, 264).\n\nGoodman links artistic status to the performance of certain symbolic\nfunctions in certain ways. Yet, his emphasis on the importance of\nasking when art is rather than what art is should be\nseen as anti-essentialist claim with respect to art: there is no one\nproperty or set of properties, not even a function or set of\nfunctions, that are distinctive of art objects. On the other hand,\nthat emphasis should not be taken to suggest that artworks can slip in\nand out of artistic status just on the grounds of use. Certainly,\nGoodman is committed to claiming that something can be a work of art\nat one time and not another (1978a, 67). Yet, he also emphasizes how\nartistic status is somewhat permanent: \u201cThe Rembrandt painting\nremains a work of art, as it remains a painting, while functioning\nonly as a blanket\u201d (1978a, 69).\n\nGoodman\u2019s positive claims with respect to the experience of art\nare certainly to be taken seriously, in spite of the fact that the\nnegative claims preceding them, once read in light of the later\ndevelopments and applications of cognitive science to art, may sound\ntoo quickly dismissive. Goodman emphasizes the cognitive role\nof emotions in the apprehension of a work of art (1976, 248). In art,\nhe emphasizes, feeling emotions, whether positive or negative,\npleasant or unpleasant, is a way to perceive the work and the world\nthrough the work. Feeling melancholy when listening to a piece of\nmusic, for instance, may be a way to perceive musical features of the\nwork, as well as to perceive the world in terms of them. Hence, the\nemotions serve the understanding. On the other hand, such claims as,\nfor instance, that the view according to which \u201cart is concerned\nwith simulated emotions suggests, as does the copy theory of\nrepresentation, that art is a poor substitute for reality\u201d\n(1976, 246) are, in light of more recent developments, in tension with\nother claims by Goodman, such as that the \u201cactor or\ndancer\u2014or the spectator\u2014sometimes notes and remembers the\nfeeling of a movement rather than its pattern, insofar as the two can\nbe distinguished at all\u201d (1976, 248). For the sort of phenomena\nmentioned in the latter claim may very well be best explained by\ncognitive theories that consider mental simulation and other forms of\nmimicry central to certain imaginative activities as well as to\nmemory.\n\nArt has a general importance to the knowledge enterprise, which is\naddressed with special clarity in Ways of Worldmaking. A\nprimary thesis in that work \u201cis that the arts must be taken no\nless seriously than the sciences as modes of discovery, creation, and\nenlargement of knowledge in the broad sense of advancement of the\nunderstanding, and thus that the philosophy of art should be conceived\nas an integral part of metaphysics and epistemology\u201d (1978a,\n102). A more general thesis of the book is that the multiple and\ncompeting \u201cversions\u201d of the world that humankind\nmakes\u2014through scientific theories (claiming, e.g., that the Sun\nis the center of the universe, or claiming that the Earth is) but also\nthrough mythology, art, philosophy, and so on and so\nforth\u2014literally make worlds; they\n\u201cfabricate\u201d what we call \u201cfacts.\u201d And there\nisn\u2019t just one, all-embracing version of the world:\nmultiple and incompatible versions are possible. That is, Goodman is a\nconstructivist and a relativist. His relativism, however, is not one\nof laissez-faire: versions can be distinguished between right and\nwrong, and indeed attempts to construct a world may fail. For the\nworlds that Goodman posits are not possible worlds brought about by\npossible descriptions of the world. Rather, when the versions are\nright, they are all part of the actual world.\n\nFor such metaphysical and epistemological approach to include the arts\namongst the means to construct worlds, one needs only to add that\nversions of the world include non-verbal versions and non-literal\nversions as well. Art forms that do not use language, such as painting\nor music or architecture, can offer ways of perceiving and\nunderstanding the world\u2014indeed ways to construct a\nworld\u2014allowing us, for instance, to see and hear and perceive\nthings in new and refreshing ways. Works of art can participate in\nworldmaking precisely because they have symbolic functions (1978a,\n102). As linguistic labels categorize the world (and new, unusual\nlabels as \u201cgrue\u201d and \u201cbleen\u201d categorize it\ndifferently), so do pictorial labels, for instance, categorize it in a\nnumber of ways (and some of them indeed in new ways). Visiting a\nmuseum can change our perception of the world, making us notice new\naspects of reality and allowing us to encounter a different reality.\nLiteral denotation, metaphorical denotation, as well as\nexemplification and expression, can all contribute to the construction\nof a world. Cervantes\u2019s Don Quixote literally denotes\nno one, yet metaphorically it denotes many of us. And artworks, by\nexemplifying shapes, colors, emotional patterns, etc., as well as by\nexpressing what they literally do not possess, can bring about a\nreorganization of the world of ordinary experience. This is not just\ntrue in the sense that seeing a painting may change our way of seeing\nthe world. Works of art may have effects that go beyond their medium,\nand hence music may affect seeing, painting affect hearing, and so on.\nEspecially in \u201cthese days of experimentation with the\ncombination of media in the performing arts\u201d [\u2026] music,\npictures, and dance \u201call interpenetrate in making a world\u201d\n(1978a, 106).\n",
