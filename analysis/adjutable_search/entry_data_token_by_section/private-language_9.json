    "main_text": "Kripke\u2019s Sceptical Wittgenstein\n4. Kripke\u2019s Sceptical Wittgenstein\n\nThe Orthodox domination of the secondary literature on private\nlanguage was largely ended by Saul Kripke\u2019s account of Wittgenstein\u2019s\ntreatment of rules and private language, in which Wittgenstein appears\nas a sceptic concerning meaning. Kripke (p. 5) denies commitment to\nthe identity of this sceptical figure with its historical source, and,\nappropriately, his account has spawned a literature of its own in\nwhich discussion often proceeds largely independently of the original\nprivate language argument: Kripke\u2019s Wittgenstein, real or fictional,\nhas become a philosopher in his own right, and for many people, it is\nnot an issue whether the historical Wittgenstein\u2019s original ideas\nabout private language are faithfully captured in this version. The\ncomplexities of the subsequent discussion of the\nphilosophical\u2014as opposed to interpretative\u2014questions\nraised by Kripke\u2019s Wittgenstein need a separate article to themselves.\n(For a survey, see Boghossian [1989].) All that will be settled here\nis the interpretative question.\n\nKripke\u2019s account resembles that given here in its rejection of\nOrthodoxy and in its emphasis on the logical priority of\nWittgenstein\u2019s discussion of rule-following to that of private\nlanguage. It differs in the prominence it gives to the opening\nsentence of Philosophical Investigations \u00a7201:\n\u2018This was our paradox: no course of action could be determined\nby a rule, because every course of action can be brought into accord\nwith the rule.\u2019 Kripke says of this (p. 68), \u2018The\nimpossibility of private language emerges as a corollary of\n[Wittgenstein\u2019s] sceptical solution of his own paradox\u2019.\nWittgenstein himself immediately brushed this \u201cparadox\u201d\naside in his very next paragraph: \u2018That there is a\nmisunderstanding here \u2026\u2019; but Kripke takes the paradox to\npose a genuine and profound sceptical problem about meaning.\n\nThe example Kripke chooses to illustrate the problem is that of\naddition. What is it to grasp the rule of addition? The application of\nthe rule is potentially infinite, and bizarre interpretations of the\nrule, as well as the standard use of it, are compatible with any\nfinite set of applications of the usual sort such as 7 + 14 = 21. So\nwhat is it which makes it true that when I say \u2018plus\u2019 I\nmean the usual addition function and not some other? Kripke (pp.\n62\u201371) understands this question as containing a Humean problem\nto which, he claims, Wittgenstein gives a Humean,\n\u2018sceptical\u2019 solution.\n\nWhat Kripke means by this comparison with a Humean problem is that\nWittgenstein is questioning the nexus between a past act of meaning\nand subsequent practice in a way analogous to that in which Hume\nquestions the causal nexus between a single past event and a\nsubsequent one. And what he means by a Humean solution is that there\nis a corresponding analogy between the ways in which Hume and\nWittgenstein handle their respective problems. Kripke\u2019s view is that,\njust as Hume says, in effect, \u201cUnique causation is\nunintelligible; A\u2019s causing B consists in\nA\u2019s being embedded in a pattern of the following of\nA-type-events by B-type-events which inclines us to\nassert that A caused B\u201d, so, comparably,\nWittgenstein says, in effect, \u201cUnique meaning is unintelligible;\nrather, someone\u2019s meaning the usual addition function when saying\n\u2018plus\u2019 consists in their being considered by a community\nto have passed the community\u2019s test for employing that\nfunction.\u201d\n\nKripke formulates the so-called Humean problem in two different\nways.\n\nThe first way is this: \u201c[T]here is no fact about me that\ndistinguishes my meaning a definite function by \u2018plus\u2019\n\u2026 and my meaning nothing at all\u201d (p. 21). The absence of\nthis fact, in Kripke\u2019s view, leads Wittgenstein to abandon the\nexplanation of the meanings of statements like \u201cBy\n\u2018plus\u2019, I meant addition\u201d in terms of\ntruth-conditions, and to replace it with explanation in terms of\nassertibility-conditions, which involve actual (not merely potential)\ncommunity agreement. (Hence the claim that this is a \u2018sceptical\nsolution\u2019: Wittgenstein is supposed to concede to the sceptic\nthe absence of truth-conditions for such statements.) This agreement,\non Kripke\u2019s account, legitimizes the assertion that I meant addition\nby \u2018plus\u2019 despite there having been no fact of the\nmatter.\n\nThis requirement of community agreement for meaning (the\n\u2018community view\u2019) obviously rules out the possibility of\nprivate language immediately, thereby rendering the argument of\nPhilosophical Investigations \u00a7\u00a7256\u2013271\nsuperfluous. This superfluity makes for an odd reading of the text;\nand the oddness is highlighted by the observation that this first\nformulation of the sceptical problem relies on Kripke\u2019s assumption\nthat we have some idea of what a fact is, independent of a statement\u2019s\nbeing true. For one of the themes of Philosophical\nInvestigations is that there is no such idea, that the only\nroute to the identification of facts is through the uses of the\nexpressions in which those facts are stated, uses which give us the\ntruth-conditions. These uses are often very different from what we\nwould expect\u2014hence the impression that truth-conditions are\nlacking\u2014and it is a matter of some philosophical difficulty to\nsee them clearly.\n\nThe other formulation of the problem is this (Kripke p. 62):\n\u201cWittgenstein questions the nexus between past\n\u2018intention\u2019 or \u2018meanings\u2019 and present\npractice: for example, between my past \u2018intentions\u2019 with\nregard to \u2018plus\u2019 and my present computation \u2026\n.\u201d The idea is that my grasp of the rule governing the use of\n\u2018plus\u2019 does not determine that I shall produce a unique\nanswer for each of indefinitely many new additions in the future. The\nimpression that something is missing here, though, is a result of just\nthat kind of confusion about determination identified in the section\nheaded \u2018The Significance of the Issue\u2019 above.\n\nKripke\u2019s account of the private language argument is thus vitiated by\nhis unargued reliance on ideas which Wittgenstein argued against. This\nof course does not show that he has not hit upon a new and more\ninteresting notion of private language than that expounded here.\nFurther, his reading of the argument gave new life to the debate over\nthe community view.\n",
