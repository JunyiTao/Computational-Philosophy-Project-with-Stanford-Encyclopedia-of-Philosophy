    "main_text": "Current Issues || Ratification\n3.6 Ratification\n\nGibbard and Harper (1978: Sec. 11) present a problem for causal\ndecision theory using an example drawn from literature. A man in\nDamascus knows that he has an appointment with Death at midnight. He\nwill escape Death if he manages at midnight not to be at the place of\nhis appointment. He can be in either Damascus or Aleppo at midnight.\nAs the man knows, Death is a good predictor of his whereabouts. If he\nstays in Damascus, he thereby has evidence that Death will look for\nhim in Damascus. However, if he goes to Aleppo he thereby has evidence\nthat Death will look for him in Aleppo. Wherever he decides to be at\nmidnight, he has evidence that he would be better off at the other\nplace. No decision is stable. Decision instability arises in cases in\nwhich a choice provides evidence for its outcome, and each choice\nprovides evidence that another choice would have been better. Reed\nRichter (1984, 1986) uses cases of decision instability to argue\nagainst causal decision theory. The theory needs a resolution of the\nproblem of decision instability.\n\nA common analysis of the problem classifies options as either\nself-ratifying or not self-ratifying. Jeffrey ([1965] 1983) introduced\nratification as a component of evidential decision theory. His version\nof the theory evaluates a decision according to the expected utility\nof the act it selects. The distinction between an act and a decision\nto perform the act grounds his definition of an option\u2019s\nself-ratification and his principle to make self-ratifying, or\nratifiable, decisions. According to his definition ([1965] 1983: 16),\n\n\n\nA ratifiable decision is a decision to perform an act of maximum\nestimated desirability relative to the probability matrix the agent\nthinks he would have if he finally decided to perform that act. \n\n\nEstimated desirability is expected utility. An agent\u2019s\nprobability matrix is an array of rows and columns for acts and\nstates, respectively, with each cell formed by the intersection of an\nact\u2019s row and a state\u2019s column containing the probability\nof the state given that the agent is about to perform the act. Before\nperforming an act, an agent may assess the act in light of a decision\nto perform it. Information the decision carries may affect the\nact\u2019s expected utility and its ranking with respect to other\nacts.\n\nJeffrey used ratification as a means of making evidential decision\ntheory yield the same recommendations as causal decision theory. In\nNewcomb\u2019s problem, for instance, two-boxing is the only\nself-ratifying option. However, Jeffrey (2004: 113n) concedes that\nevidential decision theory\u2019s reliance on ratification does not\nmake it agree with causal decision theory in all cases. Moreover,\nJoyce (2007) argues that the motivation for ratification appeals to\ncausal relations, so that even if it yields correct recommendations\nusing Jeffrey\u2019s formula for expected-utility, it still does not\nyield a purely evidential decision theory.\n\nCausal decision theory\u2019s account of self-ratification may put\naside Jeffrey\u2019s method of evaluating a decision by evaluating\nthe act it selects. Because the decision and the act differ, they may\nhave different consequences. For example, a decision may fail to\ngenerate the act it selects. Hence, the decision\u2019s expected\nutility may differ from the act\u2019s expected utility. Driving\nthrough a flooded section of highway may have high expected utility\nbecause it minimizes travel time to one\u2019s destination. However,\nthe decision to drive through the flooded section may have low\nexpected utility because for all one knows the water may be deep\nenough to swamp the car. Using an act\u2019s expected utility to\nassess a decision to perform the act leads to faulty evaluations of\ndecisions. It is better to evaluate a decision by comparing its\nexpected utility to the expected utilities of rival decisions. A\ndecision\u2019s expected utility depends on the probability of its\nexecution as well as the expected consequences of the act it\nselects.\n\nWeirich (1985) and Harper (1986) define ratification in terms of an\noption\u2019s expected utility given its realization rather than\ngiven a decision to realize it. An option is self-ratifying if and\nonly if it maximizes expected utility given its realization. This\naccount of ratification accommodates cases in which an option and a\ndecision to realize it have different expected utilities. Weirich and\nHarper also assume causal decision theory\u2019s formula for expected\nutility. In the case of Death in Damascus, causal decision theory\nconcludes that the threatened man lacks a self-ratifying option. A\nself-ratifying option emerges, however, if the man may flip a coin to\nmake his decision. Adopting the probability distribution for locations\nis called a mixed strategy, whereas choices of location are called\npure strategies. Assuming that Death cannot predict the coin\nflip\u2019s outcome, the mixed strategy is self-ratifying.\n\nDuring deliberations to resolve a decision problem, an agent may\nrevise the probabilities she assigns to pure strategies in light of\ncomputations of their expected utilities using earlier probability\nassignments. The process of revision may culminate in a stable\nprobability assignment that represents a mixed strategy. Skyrms (1982,\n1990) and Eells (1984b) investigate these dynamics of deliberation.\nSome open issues are whether adoption of a mixed strategy resolves a\ndecision problem and whether a pure strategy arising from a mixed\nstrategy that constitutes an equilibrium of deliberations is rational\nif the pure strategy itself is not self-ratifying.\n\nAndy Egan (2007) argues that causal decision theory yields the wrong\nrecommendation in decision problems with an option that provides\nevidence concerning its outcome. He entertains the case of an assassin\nwho deliberates about pulling the trigger, knowing that the\noption\u2019s realization provides evidence of a brain lesion that\nruins his aim. Egan maintains that causal decision theory mistakenly\nignores the evidence that the option provides. However, versions of\ncausal decision theory that incorporate ratification are innocent of\nthe charges. Ratification takes account of evidence an option provides\nconcerning its outcome.\n\nAny version of the expected utility principle, whether it uses\nconditional probabilities or probabilities of conditionals, must\nspecify the information that guides assignments of probabilities and\nutilities. Principles of nonconditional expected-utility maximization\nuse the same information for all options, and hence exclude\ninformation about an option\u2019s realization. The principle of\nratification uses for each option information that includes the\noption\u2019s realization. It is a principle of conditional\nexpected-utility maximization. Egan\u2019s cases count against\nnonconditional expected-utility maximization, and not against causal\ndecision theory. Conditional expected-utility maximization using\ncausal decision theory\u2019s formula for expected utility addresses\nthe cases he presents.\n\nEgan\u2019s examples do not refute causal decision theory but present\na challenge for it. Suppose that in a decision problem no\nself-ratifying option exists, or multiple self-ratifying options\nexist. How should a rational agent proceed, granting that a decision\nprinciple should take account of information that an option provides?\nThis is an open problem in causal decision theory (and in any decision\ntheory acknowledging that an option\u2019s realization may constitute\nevidence concerning its outcome). Ratification analyzes decision\ninstability but is not a complete response to it.\n\nIn response to Egan, Frank Arntzenius (2008) and Joyce (2012) argue\nthat in some decision problems an agent\u2019s rational deliberations\nusing freely available information do not settle on a single option\nbut instead settle on a probability distribution over options. They\nacknowledge that the agent may regret the option issuing from these\ndeliberations but differ about the regret\u2019s significance.\nArntzenius holds that the regret counts against the option\u2019s\nrationality, whereas Joyce denies this. Ahmed (2012) and Ralph\nWedgwood (2013) reject Arntzenius\u2019s and Joyce\u2019s responses\nto Egan because they hold that deliberations should settle on an\noption. Wedgwood introduces a novel decision principle to accommodate\nEgan\u2019s decision problems. Ahmed contends that Egan\u2019s\nanalysis of these decision problems has a flaw because when it is\nextended to some other decision problems, it declares every option\nirrational.\n\nAhmed (2014b) criticizes causal decision theory in cases of\ndecision instability.  Also, in such cases, Jack Spencer and Ian Wells\n(2019, preprint 2017) criticize a principle of causal dominance\nattributed to causal decision theory. This decision principle\nprohibits adopting an option if another causally dominates it. Joyce\n(2018) defends causal decision theory against Ahmed\u2019s and Spencer and\nWells\u2019s charges using points about deliberational dynamics. Armendt\n(2019) and Bales (2020) also defend causal decision theory\u2019s handling\nof decision instability.\n\nPoints about ratification in decision problems clarify points about\nequilibrium in game theory because in games of strategy a\nplayer\u2019s choice often furnishes evidence about other\nplayers\u2019 choices. Decision theory underlies game theory because\na game\u2019s solution identifies rational choices in the decision\nproblems the game creates for the players. Solutions to games\ndistinguish correlation and causation, as do decision principles.\nBecause in simultaneous-move games two agent\u2019s strategies may be\ncorrelated but not related as cause and effect, solutions to such\ngames do not have the same properties as solutions to sequential\ngames. Causal decision theory attends to distinctions on which\nsolutions to games depend. It supports game theory\u2019s account of\ninteractive decisions. Joyce and Gibbard (2016) describe the role of\nratification in game theory, and Stalnaker (2018) describes causal\ndecision theory\u2019s place in game theory.\n\nThe existence of self-ratifying mixed strategies in decision problems\nsuch as Death in Damascus suggests that ratification, as causal\ndecision theory explains it, supports participation in a Nash\nequilibrium of a game. Such an equilibrium assigns a strategy to each\nplayer so that each strategy in the assignment is a best response to\nthe others. Suppose that two people are playing Matching Pennies.\nSimultaneously, each displays a penny. One player tries to make the\nsides match, and the other player tries to prevent a match. If the\nfirst player succeeds, he gets both pennies. Otherwise, the second\nplayer gets both pennies. Suppose that each player is good at\npredicting the other player, and each player knows this. Then if the\nfirst player displays heads, he has reason to think that the second\nplayer displays tails. Also, if the first player displays tails, he\nhas reason to think that the second player displays heads. Because\nMatching Pennies is a simultaneous-move game, neither player\u2019s\nstrategy influences the other player\u2019s strategy, but each\nplayer\u2019s strategy is evidence of the other player\u2019s\nstrategy. Mixed strategies help resolve decision instability in this\ncase. If the first player flips his penny to settle the side to\ndisplay, then his mixed strategy is self-ratifying. The second\nplayer\u2019s situation is similar, and she also reaches a\nself-ratifying strategy by flipping her penny. The combination of\nself-ratifying strategies is a Nash equilibrium of the game.\n\nWeirich (2004: Chap. 9) presents a method of selecting among multiple\nself-ratifying strategies, and hence a method by which a group of\nplayers may coordinate to realize a particular Nash equilibrium when\nseveral exist. Although decision instability is an open problem,\ncausal decision theory has resources for addressing it. The\ntheory\u2019s eventual resolution of the problem will offer game\ntheory a justification for participation in a Nash equilibrium of a\ngame.\n",
