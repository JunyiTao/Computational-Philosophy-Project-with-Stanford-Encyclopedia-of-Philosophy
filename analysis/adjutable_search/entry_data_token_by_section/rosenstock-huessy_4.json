    "main_text": "The Partitioning of Spaces and Times in In the Cross of Reality\n5. A Christianity of Non-transcendence\n\nRosenstock-Huessy always insisted that he was a Christian thinker. If\nhe is known at all by people in the English speaking world it is as\nRosenzweig\u2019s \u2018Christian\u2019 dialogical partner and friend who\ntried, but failed, to convert Rosenzweig to Christianity. It is,\nhowever, important to understand what Rosenstock-Huessy meant by\nChristianity. The need to do this is also underscored by the fact that\nRosenstock-Huessy was a thinker who wished to explicate what it means\nto be a Christian in a post-Christian age, i.e. in an age where most\npeople not only no longer know what it means to be Christian but do\nnot know that they do not know, and yet, nevertheless, are far more\nChristian than they realize.\n\nRosenstock-Huessy\u2019s Christianity has to be seen in light of his\ntreating all past human formations (whether of the tribe, the empire,\nthe polis, etc.) as vital compounds formed by the vocabularies, with\nall the expectations and summonings, of the people constituting them.\nThese vocabularies expressed the underlying realities which made them\npossible. Thus talk of Jesus\u2019 divinity in Europe in the Middle Ages\nwas connected with, and testified to, the everyday world of churches\nthrough hymns, paintings, oaths and social office. Likewise Zeus and\nAthena were the conditions of the Greeks making the world they made,\njust as Horus and Osiris and the ka were for the Egyptians.\nTheir social classes, political powers, oaths, buildings, paintings,\nmusic etc. were not something extraneous to the powers they summoned,\nspoke of, or revered in their day-to-day actions. These respective\nages and the creations which defined them were impossible without the\ngods and the extraterrestrial powers that infused these worlds. And\nwith Rosenstock-Huessy, whether he was talking about burial sites and\ntotems, or Horus, and Osiris and the bestowing of the ka upon\nthe Pharaoh, or Homer and the Greek pantheon, or the Jewish decision\nto abandon the ways of empire, he was primarily undertaking an\narchaeological act of linguistic and sociological excavation to show\nhis readers what trials each people were responding to and how they\nhad all founded new forms of life which still resonate through our\nlives today, if we are but attentive enough to notice.\n\nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, what was unique about the Christian faith was\nthat it was a way of world-making dedicated to bringing all of human\nkind into one family based upon fundamental truths about suffering,\nlove, death, creation, redemption, and incarnation. For him, the\nChurch was big enough to embrace those with\n\u2018otherworldly\u2019, childish understandings and those who\nunderstood that Christianity was a commitment to making the world on\nthe basis of sacrificial love. Whether rightly or wrongly he was\ngenerally puzzled and astonished at what he thought were the inane and\nchildish reductions that constituted the humanist and rationalist\nunderstanding not only of Christian life, but of all pre-humanist\npagan life\n forms.[14]\n Indeed, he generally associated this attitude with a non-historical\nunderstanding of humanity\u2014one which he saw as widespread even in\nthe discipline of history\u2014which so often simply transposed\ncontemporary orientations (names) back into the past and thus missed\nso much of the experience of humanity because it insisted upon\nascribing its own modern \u2018denuded\u2019 (humanist) view of\n\u2018man\u2019 to worlds which knew nothing of \u2018man\u2019 as\nsuch.\n\nOne consequence of the triumph of humanism and rationalism, he\nbelieved, was that most moderns have simply forgotten what gods were.\nAnd he returns repeatedly to the term \u2018god\u2019 to bring out\nits sense as a power we serve which makes us speak, and guides our\nactions. In one particularly pithy formulation, which neatly captures\nthe thrust of the new thinking\u2019s insistence upon God and Man as two\nirreducible subjects of historical predications, he says that\n\u2018God and Man is a reciprocal letter exchange\u2019 (1968, 23).\nRestated in thoroughly secular terms and from our side, the forces we\nsurrender to in our lives make us what we are; we become what we\nserve; what we sacrifice ourselves to, makes us.\n\nThe failure to understand what a god is, for Rosenstock-Huessy, is on\na par with our widespread failure to see beyond our own horizon and\nunderstand the truths behind the animism of tribal peoples or the\ninsights into the moving heavens by early imperialist peoples. Thus it\nwas, he believed, that today so many, including so-called Christians,\nfailed to fathom the claims about Jesus\u2019 divinity, which had to do\nwith the overpowering of death, not in any mystical or Pythagorean\nmanner of the continuity of the individual soul in a netherworld, but\nin the triumph over death and deadly forces through forming a body\nacross time, the Church. For Rosenstock-Huessy, Jesus was proof that\nCaesar and Pharaoh and \u2018great men\u2019 were not gods and\nJesus\u2019 divinization meant that after him no one else would be God,\nthat our redemption was universal and mutual. Jesus\u2019 taking on the\nrole of the crucified was to show us that we crucify God when we do\nevil to each other, and that we fail to achieve the maximum of our\npowers (our own divinity) in our failure to obey the law of love, and\nthat to obey the commandment of love means being continually prepared\nto leave abodes ruled by death and die into new forms of love and\nfellowship.\n\nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, the basic terms of Christianity emerged out of\npagan and Jewish historical experience, and this fusion was a source\nof great historical truth about how reality is formed out of suffering\nand love. Hence a huge part of Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s corpus is devoted\nto showing the reality and power\u2014the truth\u2014of tribal and\npre-modern imperial life (particularly Egypt) as well as the Greek\ncity states and the Jewish\n people.[15]\n\n\nRosenstock-Huessy also argued that Christianity emerged as a response\nto many of the same forces which created these other forms of life,\nonly at a different historical time, a time where their degeneracy and\ndeficiency had forced a new stratagem of social survival. The\nuniqueness of this new stratagem is that due to its peculiar fusion of\nsuffering, sacrificial love, death, and universal redemption\nit was able to reinvigorate and reconstitute forms once spent. It thus\nenabled the possibility of tribal peoples to harmonize with empires,\nand poets and philosophers to join with prophets in an attempt to\nrealize the New Jerusalem. (Rosenstock-Huessy refers to this song of\nBlake\u2019s a number of times.)\n\nThis was what he meant by Christianity\u2019s founding the full count of\nthe times due to its resuscitating \u2018bodies\u2019 from other\ntimes (see especially 1938 and 1987). Like Rosenzweig, who also\ninterpreted this combination of universalisation and redemption as the\nunending task of Christianity, Rosenstock-Huessy interpreted\nChristianity through the same broad triadic rhythm as Schelling:\nPetrine, Pauline and Johannine, where there is the movement from the\nChurch visible established by Rome, to the Church invisible of the\nReformation, to the Church fully devolved, yet alive, in modern\nsociety.\n In Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s account, the first millennium of the\nChurch had created a widespread consciousness of love of the\nneighbour, having taken a faith of the Jews into the pagan world. By\nthe ninth century it had created what he calls \u2018the\nworld\u2019s first universal democracy\u2019 in All Soul\u2019s Day\nwhich declared that the soul of the poorest peasant or widow was as\nmuch loved by God as the pope or emperor and all lived in the\nknowledge of the judgment to come. By contrast, the second millennium\nhad been a connected series of \u2018total revolutions\u2019. These\nrevolutions involved the fierce actuality of last judgments, as people\nwho had lived with the promise of the second coming in their hearts\nhad reached such a state of hatred, desperation and lack, a hatred of\nlove\u2019s and heaven\u2019s absence in the society surrounding\nthem, that they had fought to bring heaven into the world. Each\nrevolution, while total in aspiration, had only been partial in\nsuccess. But the conditions of modern social and political freedom\nwere, he attempts to show in his two main works on revolution, the\nby-products of local revolts with total ambitions circulating in a\nworld that was being fused by a common history and destiny. The World\nWars were, he argued, the continuation of this revolutionary\nprocess. In sum, when Christ had said he had come to bring a sword,\neven though he was not urging the deployment of worldly means, the\nteaching of love that he had sought to place in the hearts of men and\nwomen had led to a series of convulsions and cataclysms that were\nforcing us to obey the law of love\u2014or perish. These revolutions,\nwhich stretched from the Investiture Conflict (or what he calls the\nPapal Revolution) to the First World War and the Russian Revolution,\nhad given the modern world its shape. And, he believed, its solution,\nwhich was the fulfillment of the messianic promise to Abraham and the\nreal rationale for the Church\u2019s very existence and which had\nbecome the real future-building mission of the (originally European,\nnow planetary, bodies) politics of the last millennium.\n\nThat solution was what he called a metanomical society, a planetary\nsociety in which discordances could be peacefully accommodated in\ncreative tension. In fact, while Rosenstock-Huessy remains completely\npassed over by what can loosely be called post-modernism (although he\nhad used the term as early as 1949, in his paper \u2018Liturgical\nThinking\u2019, as a way of describing contemporary life), he shares\ntwo major concerns with postmodernists: (a) the recognition that the\nglobal economy has reactivated the local and that any genuinely\ndesirable revolutionary outcome must be receptive to local customs\nwhich enrich people, and (b) that we will only be able to create a\nlife worth living at a planetary level if differences are not\ndissolved but able to retain their vitality.\n\nAccording to Rosenstock-Huessy the lesson of history and the\naccumulated memory (history) of human suffering gathered through our\nspeech-formed, time-building capacity was that we all must live as\nJew, Christian, and Pagan. In his The Christian Future and\nthe second volume of the Soziologie he would elaborate on\nthis by arguing that in our times we needed to fuse Christ, Abraham,\nBuddha and Lao Tse. His decision to make Buddhism and Taoism essential\ncomponents of the contemporary cross of reality was part of his\nattempt to help found a metanomical framework which would enable the\nconcordance of disparities. But it is fair to say that neither\nBuddhism nor Taoism, nor Islam (which he writes a section on in volume\n2 of the In the Cross of Reality), nor Hinduism occupied his\nattention anywhere near as much as the spirits of the tribes, Egypt,\nGreece, the Israelites and Christian peoples.\n",
