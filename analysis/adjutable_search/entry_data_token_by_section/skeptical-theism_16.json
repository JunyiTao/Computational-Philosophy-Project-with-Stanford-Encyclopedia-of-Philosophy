    "main_text": "Epistemological Objections || Religious Skepticism\n5.4 Religious Skepticism\n\nA similar objection is that skeptical theism leads to religious\nskepticism (Beaudoin 2000, 2005; Rowe 2006: 90\u20131; Wielenberg\n2010; Hudson 2014). Skeptical theists might respond to the previous\ncriticism by claiming that we have many ways of knowing about the\nexternal world that don\u2019t, on the face of them, involve God\ntelling us something and not deceiving us. But a staple of many\nreligious traditions is that there are certain things we know about\nonly because God has told us. For instance, consider a claim\nlike:\n\nAfterlife (Af)\n\nThere is an eternal afterlife of union with God, full of bliss and\nfree of suffering.\n\nMany religious traditions hold that, insofar as we know or are\nreasonable in believing Af, it is only because God\nhas told us, revealing it to us through a prophet, text, or direct\nreligious experience.\n\nCritics argue that theists who are skeptical theists are not\nreasonable in believing Af. The criticism here\nmirrors the one of the previous section. It is possible that God is\ndeceiving us about these matters; but skeptical theists are unable to\nreasonably rule out the possibility of divine deception. Additionally,\nin the case of the external world, agents may have a variety of ways\nof coming to know about the external world. But that kind of response\nis less plausible here. Since it seems that for claims like\nAf, our only way of knowing them is to\ndepend upon God\u2014and depend upon God not deceiving us.\n\nA different type of criticism focuses on knowledge of God\u2019s\ncommands. One starting point for this criticism is that many religious\ntexts and traditions contain a wide range of commands that purport to\nbe divine commands (Maitzen 2007). Nevertheless, most religious\nadherents do not think they are obligated to follow all of those\npurported commands. Perhaps the commands are issued by the wrong text\nor tradition; or perhaps the commands had been\n\u201csuperseded\u201d or \u201cupdated\u201d by God; or perhaps\nthe commands seem to be issued by God but couldn\u2019t be\ngiven the immoral content of the commands; or maybe the commands are\njust plain silly or arbitrary.\n\nA natural way that a theist might sift through these purported\ncommands is to consider what God would have reason to command. If the\ntheist sees no reason why God would command (e.g.) not cooking goat in\nits mother\u2019s milk, then the theist might conclude that such a\ncommand is not actually God\u2019s. But this way of reasoning about\ndivine commands looks incredibly similar to the noseeum argument for\nN-O1.2! Thus, if theists who are skeptical\ntheists are skeptical about whether that noseeum inference is\nreasonable, so too they should be skeptical that this\ninference about God\u2019s commands is reasonable as well.\n",
