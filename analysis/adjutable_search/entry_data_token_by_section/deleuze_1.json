Deleuze\u2019s Readings of Other Philosophers\n\nBefore he ever wrote \u201cin his own name\u201d in Difference\nand Repetition and Logic of Sense, Deleuze wrote a\nseries of works on figures in the history of philosophy (Hume,\nBergson, Nietzsche, Kant, and Spinoza). In writing these works,\nDeleuze sought to unearth the presuppositions he absorbed in his\neducation; chief among them, he felt, was a deep-seated privilege of\nidentity over difference. Deleuze thus set about trying to accelerate\nhowever he could a departure from Hegel, whom he saw as emblematic of\nthat privilege. Deleuze attacks Hegel and others in what we can\ncall\u2014though Deleuze did not\u2014the \u201cidentitarian\u201d\ntradition first of all by means of a radicalized reading of Kant,\nwhose genius, as Deleuze explains in Kant\u2019s Critical\nPhilosophy (1963), was to have conceived of a purely\nimmanent critique of reason\u2014a critique that did not\nseek \u201cerrors\u201d of reason produced by external causes, but\nrather \u201cillusions\u201d that arise from within reason itself by\nthe illegitimate (transcendent) uses of the syntheses of\nconsciousness. Deleuze characterized his own work as a philosophy of\nimmanence, arguing that Kant himself had failed to realize fully the\nambitions of his critique, for at least two reasons: first, the\nfailure to pursue a fully immanent critique, and second, the failure\nto propose a genetic account of real experience, resting content with\nthe account of the conditions of possible experience.\n\nFirst, Kant made the field of consciousness immanent to a\ntranscendental subject, thereby reintroducing an element of identity\nthat is transcendent (that is, external) to the field itself, and\nreserving all power of synthesis (that is, identity-formation) in the\nfield to the activity of the always already unified and transcendent\nsubject. (Deleuze was influenced in this regard by his reading of\nSartre\u2019s 1937 essay \u201cThe Transcendence of the Ego.\u201d)\nAlready in his Hume book, Empiricism and Subjectivity (1953),\nDeleuze had pointed to an empiricist reversal of Kant. Where\nKant\u2019s question had been \u201cHow can the given be given to a\nsubject?\u201d Hume\u2019s question had been \u201cHow is the\nsubject (human nature) constituted within the given?\u201d In his\nmature work, Deleuze argues for an \u201cimpersonal and\npre-individual\u201d transcendental field in which the subject as\nidentity pole which produces empirical identities by active synthesis\nis itself the result or product of differential passive\nsyntheses (for instance, in what Deleuze calls the syntheses of\nhabit, we find bodily, desiring, and unconscious\n\u201ccontractions\u201d which unify a series of experiences,\nextracting that which is to be retained in the habit and allowing the\nrest to be \u201cforgotten\u201d). Together the passive syntheses at\nall these levels form a differential field within which subject\nformation takes place as an integration or resolution of that field;\nin other words, subjects are roughly speaking the patterns of these\nmultiple and serial syntheses which fold in on themselves producing a\nsite of self-awareness. Of course, Deleuze never simply proclaims this\nas a bald thesis, but develops a genetic account of subjectivity in\nmany of his books. Taking all this into account, Deleuze summarized\nhis differential, immanent and genetic position by the at first glance\nodd phrase of \u201ctranscendental empiricism.\u201d This is cashed\nout in terms of two characteristics: (1) the abstract (e.g.,\n\u201csubject,\u201d \u201cobject,\u201d \u201cState,\u201d the\n\u201cwhole,\u201d and so on) does not explain, but must itself be\nexplained; and (2) the aim of philosophy is not to rediscover the\neternal or the universal, but to find the singular conditions under\nwhich something new is produced. In other words\u2014and this is a\npragmatic perspective from which Deleuze never\ndeviated\u2014philosophy aims not at stating the conditions of\nknowledge qua representation, but at finding and fostering the\nconditions of creative production.\n\nDeleuze\u2019s second criticism of Kant claims that he had simply\npresumed the existence of knowledge and morality as\n\u201cfacts\u201d and then sought their conditions of possibility in\nthe transcendental. But already in 1789, Salomon Maimon, whose early\ncritiques of Kant helped generate the post-Kantian tradition, had\nargued that Kant\u2019s critical project required a method of\ngenesis\u2014and not merely a method of conditioning\u2014that would\naccount for the production of knowledge, morality, and indeed reason\nitself. In other words, Maimon called for a genetic method that would\nbe able to reach the conditions of real and not merely possible\nexperience. Maimon found a solution to this problem in a principle of\ndifference: whereas identity is the condition of possibility of\nthought in general, it is difference that constitutes the genetic and\nproductive principle of real thought.\n\nThese two Maimonian exigencies\u2014the search for the genetic\nconditions of real experience and the positing of a principle\nof difference\u2014appear in almost every one of Deleuze\u2019s\nearly monographs. Nietzsche and Philosophy (1962), for\ninstance, suggests that Nietzsche completed and inverted Kantianism by\nbringing critique to bear, not simply on false claims to knowledge or\nmorality, but on true knowledge and true morality, and indeed on truth\nitself: \u201cgenealogy\u201d constituted Nietzsche\u2019s genetic\nmethod, and the will-to-power was his principle of difference.\nDeleuze\u2019s anti-Hegelianism is shown in his focus on the\nproductivity of the non-dialectical (\u201caffirmative\u201d)\ndifferential forces termed by Nietzsche \u201cnoble.\u201d These\nforces affirm themselves, and thereby differentiate themselves first,\nand only secondarily consider that from which they have differentiated\nthemselves.\n\nIn Bergsonism (1966), Deleuze develops the ideas of\nvirtuality and multiplicity that will serve as the backbone of his\nlater work. From Maimon\u2019s reading of Kant, we know that Deleuze\nneeds to substitute the notion of the condition of the genesis of the\nreal for the notion of conditions of possibility of representational\nknowledge. The positive name for that genetic condition is the\nvirtual, which Deleuze adopts from the following Bergsonian argument.\nThe notion of the possible, Bergson holds in Creative\nEvolution, is derived from a false problem that confuses the\n\u201cmore\u201d with the \u201cless\u201d and ignores differences\nin kind; there is not less but more in the idea of the possible than\nin the real, just as there is more in the idea of nonbeing than in\nthat of being, or more in the idea of disorder than in that of order.\nWhen we think of the possible as somehow \u201cpre-existing\u201d\nthe real, we think of the real, then we add to it the negation of its\nexistence, and then we project the \u201cimage\u201d of the possible\ninto the past. We then reverse the procedure and think of the real as\nsomething more than possible, that is, as the possible with existence\nadded to it. We then say that the possible has been\n\u201crealized\u201d in the real. By contrast, Deleuze will reject\nthe notion of the possible in favor of that of the virtual. Rather\nthan awaiting realization, the virtual is fully real; what happens in\ngenesis is that the virtual is actualized.\n\nThe fundamental characteristic of the virtual, that which means it\nmust be actualized rather than realized, is its differential makeup.\nDeleuze always held the critical axiom that the ground cannot resemble\nthat which it grounds; he constantly critiques the\n\u201ctracing\u201d operation by which identities in real experience\nare said to be conditioned by identities in the transcendental. For\ninstance, Deleuze criticizes Kant for copying the transcendental field\nin the image of the empirical field. That is, empirical experience is\npersonal, identitarian and centripetal; there is a central focus, the\nsubject, in which all our experiences are tagged as belonging to us.\nKant says this empirical identity is only possible if we can posit the\nTranscendental Unity of Apperception, that is, the possibility of\nadding \u201cI think\u201d to all our judgments. Instead of this\nsmuggled-in or \u201ctraced\u201d identity, Deleuze will want to\nhave the transcendental field be differential. Deleuze still wants to\nwork back from experience, but since the condition cannot resemble the\nconditioned, and since the empirical is personal and individuated, the\ntranscendental must be impersonal and pre-individual. The virtual is\nthe condition for real experience, but it has no identity; identities\nof the subject and the object are products of processes that resolve,\nintegrate, or actualize (the three terms are synonymous for Deleuze) a\ndifferential field. The Deleuzean virtual is thus not the condition of\npossibility of any rational experience, but the condition of genesis\nof real experience.\n\nAs we have seen, the virtual, as genetic ground of the actual, cannot\nresemble that which it grounds; thus, if we are confronted with actual\nidentities in experience, then the virtual ground of those identities\nmust be purely differential. Deleuze adopts \u201cmultiplicity\u201d\nfrom Bergson as the name for such a purely differential field. In this\nusage, Deleuze later clarifies, \u201cmultiplicity\u201d designates\nthe multiple as a substantive, rather than as a predicate. The\nmultiple as predicate generates a set of philosophical problems under\nthe rubric of \u201cthe one and the many\u201d (a thing is one or\nmultiple, one and multiple, and so on). With multiplicity, or the\nmultiple as substantive, the question of the relation between the\npredicates one/multiple is replaced by the question of distinguishing\ntypes of multiplicities (as with Bergson\u2019s distinction of\nqualitative and quantitative multiplicities in Time and Free\nWill). A typological difference between substantive\nmultiplicities, in short, is substituted for the dialectical\nopposition of the one and the multiple.\n\nIn sum, then, against the \u201cmajor\u201d post-Kantian tradition\nof Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, Deleuze in effect posited his own\n\u201cminor\u201d post-Kantian trio of Maimon, Nietzsche, and\nBergson. To these he added a trio of pre-Kantians, Spinoza, Leibniz\nand Hume, but read through a post-Kantian lens.\n\nWe have already touched on Deleuze\u2019s reading of Hume. Let us now\nturn to Spinoza, for whom Deleuze\u2019s admiration was seemingly\nlimitless; for Deleuze, Spinoza was the \u201cprince\u201d or even\nthe \u201cChrist\u201d of philosophers. There are many Spinozist\ninheritances in Deleuze, but one of the most important is certainly\nthe notion of univocity in ontology. Univocity\u2014as opposed to its\ngreat rivals, equivocity and analogy\u2014is the key to developing a\n\u201cphilosophy of difference\u201d (Deleuze\u2019s term for his\nproject in Difference and Repetition), in which difference\nwould no longer be subordinated to identity. The result is a Spinozism\nminus substance, a purely modal or differential universe. In\nunivocity, as Deleuze reads Spinoza, being is said in a single sense\nof all of which it is said, but it is said of difference itself. What\nis that difference? Difference is difference in degrees of\n\u201cpower\u201d; in interpreting this term we must distinguish the\ntwo French words puissance and pouvoir. In social\nterms, puissance is immanent power, power to act rather than\npower to dominate another; we could say that puissance is\npraxis (in which equals clash or act together) rather than\npoiesis (in which others are matter to be formed by the\ncommand of a superior, a sense of transcendent power that matches what\npouvoir indicates for Deleuze). In the most general terms\nDeleuze develops throughout his career, puissance is the\nability to affect and to be affected, to form assemblages or\nconsistencies, that is, to form emergent unities that nonetheless\nrespect the heterogeneity of their components.\n\nThe final important figure in Deleuze\u2019s readings of other\nphilosophers is Leibniz, to whom, it must be recalled, Maimon appealed\nin his criticism of Kant. In 1988, Deleuze published a book on Leibniz\nentitled The Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque, which added new\nelements to the reading of Leibniz that appeared in Deleuze\u2019s\nearlier books: an interpretation centered on the concept of the fold,\na development of a concept of the Baroque, and an attempt to define a\nneo-Leibnizianism in terms of contemporary artistic and scientific\npractices. While The Fold is a fascinating work, we will\nconcentrate here on Deleuze\u2019s early reading of Leibniz, which\nplays an important role in Difference and Repetition.\n\nDeleuze pushes Leibniz\u2019s thought to a point where Leibniz could\nnever have taken it, given his theological presuppositions. This is\nthe point where one begins to consider the virtual domain on its own\naccount, freed from its actualization in a world and its individuals.\nOn this score, Deleuze often likes to cite Jorge Luis Borges\u2019s\nfamous story, \u201cThe Garden of the Forking Paths,\u201d in which\nsuch a virtual world is described in the labyrinthine book of a\nChinese philosopher named Ts\u2019ui P\u00ean: \u201cIn all\nfiction, when a man is faced with alternatives, he chooses one at the\nexpense of others. In the almost unfathomable Ts\u2019ui P\u00ean,\nhe chooses\u2014simultaneously\u2014all of them\u2026 In\nTs\u2019ui P\u00ean\u2019s work, all the possible solutions occur,\neach one being the point of departure for other bifurcations.\u201d\nLeibniz had in fact given a similar presentation of the world at the\nconclusion of the Theodicy.\n\nIn Deleuze\u2019s transformation of the Leibnizian / Borgesian image,\nthe three Kantian transcendent Ideas of God, World, and Self all take\non a completely different demeanor. First, God is no longer a Being\nwho compares and chooses the richest compossible world; he has now\nbecome a pure Process that affirms incompossibilities and passes\nthrough them.\n\nSecond, the world is no longer a continuous world defined by its\npre-established harmony; instead, divergences, bifurcations, and\nincompossibles must now be seen to belong to one and the same\nuniverse, a chaotic universe in which divergent series trace endlessly\nbifurcating paths, and give rise to violent discords and dissonances\nthat are never resolved into a harmonic tonality: a\n\u201cchaosmos,\u201d as Deleuze puts it (borrowing a word from\nJoyce) and no longer a world. In contrast, Leibniz could only save the\n\u201charmony\u201d of this world by relegating discordances and\ndisharmonies to other possible worlds\u2014this was his theological\nsleight of hand.\n\nThird, selves or individuals, rather than being closed upon the\ncompossible and convergent world they express from within, are now\ntorn open, and kept open through the divergent series and\nincompossible ensembles that continually pull them outside themselves.\nThe \u201cmonadic\u201d subject, as Deleuze puts it, becomes the\n\u201cnomadic\u201d subject. In other words, if Deleuze is\nLeibnizian, it is only by eliminating the idea of a God who chooses\nthe best of all possible worlds, with its pre-established harmony and\nwell-established selves; in Deleuze, incompossibilities and\ndissonances belong to one and the same world, the only world, our\nworld. But they belong to our world as its virtual register;\ndeveloping the thought of the virtual is one of the great challenges\nof Deleuze\u2019s masterpiece, Difference and Repetition, to\nwhich we now turn.\n",
