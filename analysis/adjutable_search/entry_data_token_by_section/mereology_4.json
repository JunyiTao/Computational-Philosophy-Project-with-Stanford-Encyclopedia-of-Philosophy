    "main_text": "Decomposition Principles\n3. Decomposition Principles\n\nM is standardly viewed as embodying the common core\nof any mereological theory. Not just any partial ordering qualifies as\na part-whole relation, though, and establishing what further\nprinciples should be added to (P.1)\u2013(P.3) is precisely the\nquestion a good mereological theory is meant to answer. It is here\nthat philosophical issues begin to multiply, over and above the\ngeneral concerns mentioned in Section 2.1.\n\nGenerally speaking, such further principles may be divided into two\nmain groups. On the one hand, one may extend M by\nmeans of decomposition principles that take us from a whole\nto its parts. For example, one may consider the idea that whenever\nsomething has a proper part, it has more than one\u2014i.e., that\nthere is always some mereological difference (a\n\u201cremainder\u201d) between a whole and its proper parts. This\nneed not be true in every model for M: a world with\nonly two items, only one of which is part of the other, would be a\ncounterexample, though not one that could be illustrated with the sort\nof geometric diagram used in Figure 1. On the other hand, one may\nextend M by means of composition principles\nthat go in the opposite direction\u2014from the parts to the whole.\nFor example, one may consider the idea that whenever there are some\nthings, there exists a whole that consists exactly of those\nthings\u2014i.e., that there is always a mereological sum\n(or \u201cfusion\u201d) of two or more parts. Again, this need not\nbe true in a model for M, and it is a matter of much\ncontroversy whether the idea should hold unrestrictedly. \n",
