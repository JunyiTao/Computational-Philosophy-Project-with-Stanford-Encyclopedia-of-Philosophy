    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nBorn to an observant Jewish family in Riga in 1903, Leibowitz gained\nhis education at the Gymnasium, with concurrent\nhome-schooling for his Jewish studies, before the family fled Russia\nin 1919 for Berlin. At the University of Berlin, Leibowitz studied\nchemistry and philosophy, receiving his doctorate in the former in\n1924. After studying at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute from\n1926\u20131928, Leibowitz went onto study medicine in Koln and\nHeidelberg, though with the Nazis gaining power he would gain his\nformal medical degree in Basel. In 1935 he moved to Palestine,\ninitially as professor of biochemistry at the Hebrew University, going\non to be appointed as head of biological and organic chemistry and\nprofessor of neurophysiology at the Medical School, as well as\nlecturing on the history and philosophy of science. Yet these formal\nacademic appointments formed but one side of his work, and far from\nthe most public, for in addition Leibowitz taught Jewish thought,\nwhether in an academic context, in small study groups, or on\ntelevision and radio, with a number of these broadcasts and\nstudy-group notes having since been published. But aside from these\nactivities and his being editor in chief of several volumes of the\nEncyclopedia Hebraica, it was for his political interventions\nthat Leibowitz would gain most notoriety on the Israeli public scene,\nwhether in his criticism of the religious parties as the \u201ckept\nmistress\u201d (Judaism, 115) of the Israeli government, his\nargument as early as 1968 that Israel should withdraw from the\nnewly-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip, or his public call for\nconscientious objectors from the time of the Lebanon war of 1982 and\nsubsequently in the Palestinian territories. Leibowitz\u2019s ability\nto stir up public controversy was in evidence as late as 1993, the\nyear before he died, in a speech to the Israel Council for\nIsraeli-Palestinian Peace, where he reiterated his call on soldiers to\nrefuse to serve in the Territories, using, not for the first time,\nhighly provocative language comparing special units of the Israeli\narmy to the SS. The speech followed the announcement that he was to\nreceive the Israel prize \u2013 the country\u2019s most prestigious\ncivilian award \u2013 in recognition of his life\u2019s work, a move\nthat precipitated an appeal to the Supreme Court, and a threat to\nboycott the ceremony by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Leibowitz,\nhowever, saved everyone further embarrassment by declining the\naward.\n",
