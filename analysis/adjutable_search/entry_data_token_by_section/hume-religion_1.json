Empiricism, Scepticism and the Very Idea of God\n\nA good starting point for understanding Hume\u2019s views on theism\nis his empiricism. The potential for empiricism to produce skeptical\nconclusions concerning our knowledge of God was already apparent in\nHobbes\u2019s work, which embraced similar empiricist principles\nconcerning the foundations of human knowledge. The most striking\naspect of Hobbes\u2019s position on this subject is his claim that we\nhave no positive idea of a God with infinite attributes.\n\nWhatever we imagine is finite. Therefore there is no idea or\nconception of anything we call infinite. No man can have in\nhis mind an image of infinite magnitude, nor conceive infinite\nswiftness, infinite time, or infinite force, or infinite power\n\u2026 And therefore the name of God is used, not to make\nus conceive him (for he is incomprehensible, and his\ngreatness and power are inconceivable), but that we may honour him.\nAlso because whatsoever \u2026 we conceive has been perceived first\nby sense, either all at once or by parts, a man can have no thought\nrepresenting anything not subject to sense\u2026 (Hobbes,\nLeviathan, 3.12)\n\n\nConsistent with this view Hobbes provides a minimalist and negative\ntheology. According to Hobbes, our idea of God is like a blind\nman\u2019s idea of fire. A blind man lacks any positive idea of\n\u201cwhat kind of thing fire is,\u201d knowing only that fire is\n\u201cthat somewhat\u201d that \u201cwarm[eth] him\u201d;\nanalogously, we lack any positive idea of a God with infinite\nattributes, and understand by \u201cGod\u201d only the cause of the\nworld (Hobbes, Citizen, 15.14; Leviathan, 31.15).\nAttempts to ascribe further positive attributes to God are rejected as\nanthropomorphism (Hobbes, Human Nature, 11.3;\nLeviathan, 31.25-28; Citizen, 15.14). Clearly, then,\nHobbes employs his empiricist principles to emphasize the\n\u201cnarrow limits of our phantasy,\u201d putting knowledge of a\nGod with infinite attributes beyond the scope of human\nunderstanding.\n\nTheists responding to Hobbes\u2019s empiricist scepticism concerning\nour idea of God had three basic options. One was to reject his\nempiricist principles concerning the origin of all our ideas and argue\nthat our idea of God is either innate or derived from reason. Another\nalternative was to accept empiricism about the origin of our ideas but\ndeny that this has any sceptical implications for our knowledge of\nGod. This is the route Locke takes in his Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, where it is argued that our idea of God is a\ncomplex idea arrived at by augmenting simple ideas acquired through\nreflection on our experience of the operations of our minds. A third\nalternative, which had been favoured by Catholic and Protestant\northodoxy, was to allow the experiential origin of ideas but then go\non to say that ideas of creaturely attributes can be applied to God\nanalogously, on the basis of a supposed degree of similarity or\nresemblance between God and creatures. This route was taken by, among\nothers, the Irish theologian Peter Browne in Things Divine and\nSupernatural Conceived by Analogy with Things Natural and Human\n(1733). This issue concerning our idea of God was fundamental to the\nwhole early 18th century theological debate as it concerned\nthe various schools of \u201creligious philosophers.\u201d During\nthis period freethinking critics (e.g. Toland and Collins) used these\ndifficulties to argue, along the lines of Hobbes, that we have no\nclear idea of God. Hume\u2019s views about the origins and nature of\nour ideas should be considered with reference to this controversy.\n\nWhat is fundamental to Hume\u2019s entire empiricist program in the\nTreatise is his \u201ccopy-principle\u201d or the claim\nthat \u201call our ideas, or weak perceptions, are derived from our\nimpressions, or strong perceptions, and that we can never think of any\nthing which we have not seen without us, or felt in our minds\u201d\n(TA, 16\u20137/ 647). Hume goes on to observe that this\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d is of considerable importance \u201cfor\ndeciding all controversies concerning ideas\u201d. \u201cWhenever\nany idea is ambiguous\u201d, he continues, we always have\n\u201crecourse to the impression, which must render it clear and\nprecise\u201d (TA, 7/648). If we suspect that \u201cany\nphilosophical term has no idea annexed to it\u201d, Hume suggests, we\ncan always ask \u201cfrom what impression that pretended idea is\nderived?\u201d (TA, 7/648\u20139) If no impression can be produced,\nwe must conclude \u201cthe term is altogether insignificant\u201d\n(TA, 7/ 648).\n\nGiven the prominence of the copy-principle in Hume\u2019s\nphilosophical system, and its obvious relevance to the debate\nconcerning our idea of God, it is surprising to find that in the\nTreatise Hume barely mentions our idea of God, much less\nprovides any detailed account of the nature and origin of this idea.\nIt would be a mistake, however, to conclude from this that theological\nproblems, as they concern our idea of God, are far from his mind. On\nthe contrary, neglecting this topic, in face of the ongoing debate and\nits obvious relevance for Hume\u2019s philosophy in the\nTreatise, could be a way of suggesting a (strong) sceptical\nmessage.\n\nIn the Enquiry, Hume offers a Lockean account of the\norigination of the idea of God, saying that \u201c[the] idea of God,\nas meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good Being, arises\nfrom reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and augmenting,\nwithout limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom\u201d (EU,\n2.6/19; and cp. TA, 26/656; EU, 7.25/72). Here our idea of God is\ntreated as complex and derived from simple ideas based on reflection\non the operations of our own minds, which we \u201caugment without\nlimit.\u201d We would be misguided if we took this account at face\nvalue, however.  For, to start with, we know from Hume\u2019s\nprivate correspondence that he considered the idea of God to be\nproblematic, writing to William Mure in 1743 (i.e., in the period\nbetween the publication of the Treatise and Enquiry)\nthat inasmuch as God is not the object of \u201cany Passion or\nAffection\u201d or of \u201cthe Senses or Imagination,\u201d and\n\u201cvery little of the Understanding\u201d as well, it follows\nthat God is \u201cunknown to us\u201d and cannot \u201cexcite any\nAffection\u201d in us (LET, I, 51/#21). Hume goes on to recognize\nthat \u201centhusiasts\u201d distort God \u201cinto a Resemblance\nwith themselves, & by that means render him more\ncomprehensible,\u201d but this, he notes, is a degradation of the\nidea of God. This take on the idea of God is clearly more Hobbesean\nthan Lockean.\n\n\nSecond, in Enquiry XI Hume presents a critique of our\n\u201cconjectures\u201d about God\u2019s nature and attributes, as\nbased on evidence of design in this world. In this section Hume\nemphasizes the point that God\u2019s being is \u201cso different,\nand so much superior\u201d to human nature that we are not able to\nform any clear or distinct idea of his nature and attributes, much\nless one based on our own qualities and characteristics.\n\nThe Deity is known to us only by his productions, and is a single\nbeing in the universe, not comprehended under any species or genus,\nfrom whose experienced attributes or qualities, we can, by analogy,\ninfer any attribute or quality in him\u2026 (EU, 11.26 / 144)\n\n\nIn a later passage Hume goes on to remark that God is \u201ca Being,\nso remote and incomprehensible, who bears much less analogy\nto any other being in the universe than the sun to a waxen taper, and\nwho discovers himself only by some faint traces or outlines, beyond\nwhich we have no authority to ascribe to him any attribute or\nperfection\u201d (EU, 11.27 / 145\u20136 \u2014 my emphasis). It\nis, evidently, Hume\u2019s considered view that in respect of our\nidea of God we lack the relevant impressions that can serve as the\norigin of this idea. \n\nThird, in Dialogues X Hume goes on to argue, even more\nradically, that the analogy between creaturely attributes and the\nsupposed attributes of God is not only weak, but breaks down\naltogether in view of the evil that the theist believes God allows in\nthe world. For since \u201cneither man nor any animal are\nhappy\u201d it follows that an omnipotent God must \u201cnot will\ntheir happiness,\u201d in which case God\u2019s \u201cbenevolence\nand mercy\u201d cannot in any significant way be said to resemble or\nbe analogous to \u201cthe benevolence and mercy of men\u201d\n(Dialogues, X, 23).\n\nWe see then that Hume is in substantial agreement with Hobbes that in\nrespect of our idea of God, our predicament is much the same as that\nof a blind man trying to form the idea of fire. \n",
