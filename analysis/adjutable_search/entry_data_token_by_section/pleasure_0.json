    "main_text": "A Feature of Momentary Experience\n1. A Feature of Momentary Experience\n\nPleasure seems obvious and even intimate in a friend\u2019s smile,\nposture, or manner and when we notice we are having a good time and\nenjoying ourselves. To some in the grip of the simple picture (\u00b62\nabove) it has seemed introspectively obvious that pleasure is a simple\nfeeling we know directly in momentary conscious experience and almost\nas obvious that it is something we often do, and should, pursue. But\nGilbert Ryle, writing when behaviorism ruled psychology, maintained\nthat pleasure is never any episode of conscious experience at all\n(1949, IV, 6) and Fred Feldman (2004, discussed in \u00a72.3.2 below)\nmaintains that it is a pure propositional attitude of which feeling is\nno essential part. Other opponents of the simple picture maintained\nthat pleasure requires a much larger cognitive context than, on the\nsimple picture, it does. Elizabeth Anscombe thereby helped refocus\nphilosophers\u2019 attention on the foundational question that\nuncritical acceptance of the simple picture had led many modern\nphilosophers to neglect, What is pleasure? \n",
