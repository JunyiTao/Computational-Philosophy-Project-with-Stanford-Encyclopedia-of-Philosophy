    "main_text": "Preliminaries\n1. Preliminaries\n\r\nIf ethics is widely regarded as the most accessible branch of\r\nphilosophy, it is so because many of its presuppositions are,\r\nseemingly, self-evident or trivial truths: All human actions, for\r\nexample, serve some end or purpose; whether they are right or wrong\r\ndepends on the agent\u2019s overall aims. At least for secularists,\r\nthe attainment of these overall aims is regarded as a major condition\r\nof the good life. What we regard as a life worth living also depends\r\non the notion we have of our own nature and of the conditions of its\r\nfulfillment. This, in turn, is determined, at least in part, by the\r\nvalues and standards of the society we live in. Personal ends and\r\npurposes depend in each case not only on reason, but also on the\r\nindividual agents\u2019 dispositions (i.e., their ingrained likes and\r\ndislikes, which determine their personal character). The attainment of\r\nthese ends can also depend at least in part on external factors, such\r\nas health, material prosperity, social status, and even on good looks\r\nor sheer luck.\n\r\nAlthough these presuppositions may seem self-evident, most of the time,\r\nhuman beings are aware of them only implicitly because they lead\r\ntheir lives in accordance with pre-established standards and values\r\nthat are, under normal circumstances, not objects of reflection. It is\r\nonly in times of crisis that a society\u2019s traditions and precepts\r\nare challenged by someone like Socrates, who sees the need to disturb\r\nhis fellows\u2019 complacency. The historical Socrates was, of\r\ncourse, not the first to question the Greek way of life. Presocratic\r\nphilosophers such as Xenophanes, Heraclitus, or Empedocles had been\r\ncritics of their times, and the sophists had argued provocatively\r\nthat, contrary to the na\u00efve view, it is custom and convention,\r\nrather than nature that set the standards for what is deemed right or\r\nwrong, good or bad, in every society. But if other thinkers preceded\r\nSocrates with moral and social criticism, he was certainly the first\r\nto challenge his fellows on an individual basis on the ground that\r\n\u2018the unexamined life is not worth living\u2019 (Ap.\r\n38a). Whatever position one may take in the controversy concerning the\r\ndegree to which Plato\u2019s early dialogues are true to the\r\nhistorical Socrates\u2019 discussions, the independent testimony of\r\nXenophon leaves little doubt that Socrates\u2019 cross-examinations\r\n(elenchos) provoked the kind of enmity against him that led\r\nto his conviction and execution. In the eyes of conservative\r\nAthenians, Socrates\u2019 questioning undermined the traditional\r\nvalues of their society. As Socrates saw it, the \u2018virtues\u2019\r\n\u2013 which is to say the social skills, attitudes, and\r\ncharacter-traits possessed by most Athenian citizens of his time\r\n\u2013 were all too often geared towards their possessors\u2019\r\nwealth, power, and capacities for self-indulgence, to the detriment of\r\npublic morality and the community\u2019s well-being (see the entry on\r\n Socrates).\n\r\nThe Socratic legacy prompted Plato to engage in a thorough examination\r\nof the nature of knowledge and reality, an examination that gradually\r\ntook him far beyond the scope of the historical Socrates\u2019\r\ndiscussions. Nevertheless, Plato continued to present most of his\r\ninvestigations as dialogues between Socrates and some partner or\r\npartners. And Plato preserved the dialogical form even in those of his\r\nlate works where Socrates is replaced by a stand-in and where the\r\ndidactic nature of the presentations is hard to reconcile with the\r\npretense of live discussion. But these didactic discourses continue to\r\ncombine questions of ethical, political, social, or psychological\r\nimportance with metaphysical, methodological, and epistemological\r\nconsiderations. And it can be hard to assess the extent to which Plato\r\nagrees with the pronouncements of his speakers, whether that speaker\r\nis Socrates or anyone else. Furthermore, the fact that a certain\r\nethical problem or its solution is not mentioned in a certain dialogue\r\ndoes not mean that Plato was unaware of it. There is, therefore, no\r\ncertainty concerning the question: \u201cWhat did Plato see and when\r\ndid he first see it?\u201d The lack of information about the order in\r\nwhich Plato wrote his works adds to this difficulty. It stands to\r\nreason, however, that he started with the short dialogues that\r\nquestion traditional virtues \u2013 wisdom, courage, justice,\r\nmoderation, piety. It also stands to reason that Plato gradually\r\nwidened the scope of his investigations by reflecting not only on the\r\nsocial and political conditions of morality but also on the logical,\r\nepistemological, and metaphysical presuppositions of a successful\r\nmoral theory. These theoretical reflections often take on a life of\r\ntheir own. Several of Plato\u2019s later works address ethical\r\nproblems only marginally or not at all. The Parmenides, the\r\nTheaetetus, and the Sophist deal primarily or\r\nexclusively with epistemological and metaphysical problems of a quite\r\ngeneral nature. Nevertheless, as witnessed by the Philebus,\r\nthe Statesman, the Timaeus, and the Laws,\r\nPlato never lost interest in the question of the conditions of the\r\ngood human life.\n",
