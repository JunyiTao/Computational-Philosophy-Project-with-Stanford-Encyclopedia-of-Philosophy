    "main_text": "The Official Doctrine and its contemporary offshoots || The ontological commitment\n6.1 The ontological commitment\n\nThe ontological commitment of the view is that there are two different\nkinds of things, body and mind, that are somehow harnessed together.\nThe one exists in space and is subject to mechanical or physical laws;\nthe other is not in space and is not subject to these laws. And yet\nthe mind and body influence each other. The view that mind and body\nare somehow fundamentally different or distinct, but nonetheless\ninteract, leads to the philosophical conundrum known as the\nmind-body problem. For contemporary philosophers of mind, the\nmind-body problem no longer involves construing the mind as an\nindependent substance. But working out the relation between mental and\nphysical properties remains an urgent project (Kim, 2).\n [4]\n\nIn contemporary philosophy of mind, Ryle is credited with having\nestablished an important connection between mental predicates and\nbehaviour; but many of his successors (Place, Armstrong, Putnam, and\nFodor) thought he misconstrued the nature of that connection. When\nstrict physicalist positions were beset by objections from the\nmultiple realisability of mental predicates,\n\u201ctoken-physicalist\u201d versions of functionalism (or\n\u201contic-neutral\u201d versions of the causal theory of mind)\nstepped up to the plate, and advertised that, in acknowledging\nbehavioural outputs as well as stimulus conditions, they were\nretaining what was right about Ryle\u2019s emphasis on behaviour (in\nthe circumstances), but rejecting what they considered the\n\u201cexplanatory vacuity\u201d of conceptual or definitional links\nbetween mental predicates and behavioural ones. These were replaced\nwith causal links between the alleged referents of the mental terms\nand the action to be explained.\n\nBut to suppose the explanatory power of mental conduct terms depends\non their designating an event or state that is causally related to the\nperformance is to accept another version of the\n\u201cparamechanical\u201d hypothesis, even though it is now couched\nin ontic-neutral or physicalist\n terms.[5]\n\nAlthough Ryle\u2019s own target is the attempt to staple an elusive\nmental event construed as a conscious \u201cexperience\u201d onto a\nrespectable biological (muscular, neurophysiological) causal chain, it\nis nevertheless clear that the problems he sees will also apply to\nmodern-day variations on the dualist theme. That is, it will also\napply to weak, non-reductive identity theories that wish to preserve a\ncausal role for mental properties. For consider:\n\nThe episodes supposed to constitute the careers of mind have one sort\nof existence, while those constituting the careers of bodies have\nanother sort; and no bridge-status is allowed \u2026. Minds, as the\nwhole legend describes them, are what must exist if there is to be a\ncausal explanation of the intelligent behaviour of human bodies; and\nminds, as the theory describes them, live on a floor of existence\ndefined as being outside the causal system to which bodies belong.\n(1949a, 65)\n\n\nIt would be difficult to find a better anticipation of the mind-body\nproblem as we know it today. The problem of mental causation may not\nbe exactly the same as Descartes\u2019 problem, but it is nonetheless\ninherited by anyone who insists that mental properties must, on the\none hand, make a causal difference and by those who, on the other,\nthink that physics is a closed causal system. Just as mind-body\ninteraction was a problem for substance dualism, so is mental\ncausation still the problem facing the many varieties of\n(both reductive and non-reductive) physicalism (Kim, 29-30).\n\nIt seems then that the two ontological aspects of the Official\nDoctrine\u2014finding a place for the mental in the physical world\nand the problem of mental causation\u2014still survive today.\n",
