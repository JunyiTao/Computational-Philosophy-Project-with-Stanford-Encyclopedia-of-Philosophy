    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806\u201373) was the most influential English\nlanguage philosopher of the nineteenth century. He was a naturalist, a\nutilitarian, and a liberal, whose work explores the consequences of a\nthoroughgoing empiricist outlook. In doing so, he sought to combine\nthe best of eighteenth-century Enlightenment thinking with newly\nemerging currents of nineteenth-century Romantic and historical\nphilosophy. His most important works include System of Logic\n(1843), On Liberty (1859), Utilitarianism (1861) and\nAn Examination of Sir William Hamilton\u2019s Philosophy\n(1865).\n",
