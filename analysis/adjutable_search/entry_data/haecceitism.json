    "preamble": "\n\nImagine the following alternative history of the world: Things are\nqualitatively just as they actually are. There is no\ndifference in anything like the shape, size, or mass of objects. There\nis no difference in the number of entities. Even so, there is a\nnon-qualitative difference and it concerns you in particular.\nAccording to this alternative history, you fail to exist. In your\nplace, there is a distinct individual, Double. Double has all the\nqualitative properties, whether mental or physical, you actually have,\nbut, despite all these similarities, you and Double are distinct\nindividuals. So, according to this alternative history, you do not\nexist.\n\nIs this alternative history of the world a possible one? And what\nshould we make of other alleged qualitatively indiscernible\npossibilities? For example, is it possible for a pair of siblings to\n\u201cswap\u201d their actual qualitative roles\u2014i.e., where\nthe actually firstborn twin is born second and vice\nversa\u2014but where no qualitative features of the world are\naltered? In a similar vein, suppose, following Black (1952), that\nthere could be a world containing only two qualitatively indiscernible\niron spheres. Are there also other possible worlds where these\nspheres are \u201creplaced\u201d by numerically distinct yet\nqualitatively indiscernible doppelg\u00e4ngers?\n\nAn affirmative answer to these questions entails haecceitism,\naccording to which the world could differ non-qualitatively without\ndiffering qualitatively. So, if the alternative history described\nabove where Double replaces you is a genuine possibility, it is a\nmaximal possibility\u2014i.e., a total way the world could\nbe\u2014that differs haecceitistically from actuality.\nSimilarly, if it is possible for twins to swap their birth orders\nwhile leaving all qualitative matters unchanged, that maximal\npossibility also differs haecceitistically from actuality.\n\nAccording to anti-haecceitism, there are no haecceitistic\ndifferences between maximal possibilities. Anti-haecceitism therefore\nholds that the world could not be haecceitistically different without\nbeing qualitatively different. So, for anti-haecceitists, the\nalternative history of the world described above is not possible nor\nare there are distinct maximal possibilities that differ solely in\nterms of individuals \u201cswapping\u201d their qualitative roles or\nbeing \u201creplaced\u201d by non-actual individuals.\n\nThis entry is a general overview of the issues raised by haecceitism\nand anti-haecceitism. In Sections One through Three, various\nformulations of haecceitism are presented and the connections between\nhaecceitism, haecceities, and essentialism are examined. In Sections\nFour and Five, arguments for and against haecceitism are surveyed.\nSection Six discusses the scope of haecceitistic differences and the\nprospects for accepting only certain kinds of haecceitistic\ndifferences. Finally, Section Seven briefly notes the significance of\nhaecceitism and its denial within various areas of metaphysics.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Formulating Haecceitism\n\nHaecceitism is a modal thesis. Like other modal theses, there are\ncompeting metaphysical frameworks in which it might be expressed. Some\nof these frameworks involve a commitment to possible worlds or maximal\npossibilities, while other frameworks aim to do without these\ncommitments. To further complicate matters, some frameworks\ndistinguish possible worlds from the maximal possibilities they\nrepresent while other frameworks collapse this putative\ndistinction by identifying maximal possibilities with possible worlds.\nThis section surveys some of the options for formulating and\ninterpreting haecceitism but, as Skow (2008, 2011) argues, any\nformulation of haecceitism that employs the framework of possible\nworlds will tendentiously presuppose something about the nature of\npossibilities or possible worlds. For this reason, the proper\nformulation of haecceitism is itself a matter of controversy.\n1.1 Possibilities and Possible Worlds\n\nFor modalists, the correct analysis of modality involves no\nquantification over possibilities or possible worlds. (On modalism,\nsee Forbes (1992), Melia (2003: 81\u201398) and Peacocke (1999:\n155\u2013159).) Instead, modal notions are properly understood in\nterms of primitive modal operators like the box and diamond of modal\nlogic. Since modalists do without quantification over possibilities or\npossible worlds, haecceitism and anti-haecceitism cannot be expressed\nin terms of differences between such entities. But, following Skow\n(2008), the modalist can nevertheless characterize anti-haecceitism as\nfollows:\n\nModalist Anti-Haecceitism:\nNecessarily, the world could not be non-qualitatively different\nwithout being qualitatively different.\n\nWithin the modalist framework, haecceitism is therefore equivalent to\nthe denial of Modalist Anti-Haecceitism.\n\nThose who reject the expressive limitations of modalism can help\nthemselves to richer ontological resources in characterizing\nhaecceitism. For example, if quantification over possibilities is\npermitted, two distinctions among possibilities prove especially\nuseful for formulating haecceitism. According to the first\ndistinction, some possibilities are maximal: they are total\nways the entire world could have been. So, for any possibility, a\nmaximal possibility includes that possibility or its negation. (On\nsome views, talk of possibilities including other possibilities is\nunderstood in terms of entailment. On other views,\n\u201cinclusion\u201d is understood in terms of set\nmembership\u2014e.g., membership relations between sets of\npropositions. Here, inclusion is taken as a neutral bit of\nterminology.) In contrast, non-maximal possibilities like the\npossibility that Obama is human are less than total ways things could\nhave been.\n\nA second distinction among possibilities divides non-qualitative\npossibilities, which are ways specific individuals like Napoleon\nor Nefertiti could have been, from qualitative possibilities,\nwhich are not tied to any specific individuals. So, for example, the\npossibility that Napoleon escapes Elba is non-qualitative, while the\npossibility that there are four red objects is a qualitative\npossibility. (On some views, the distinction between qualitative and\nnon-qualitative possibilities can be identified with or analyzed in\nterms of the distinction between de dicto and de re\npossibilities.) Granted these two distinctions among possibilities,\nhaecceitism can be characterized as follows:\n\nPossibility Haecceitism: There are distinct maximal\npossibilities that differ only with respect to the non-qualitative\npossibilities they include.\n\nAccording to Possibility Haecceitism, maximal possibilities that\ndiffer haecceitistically include the very same qualitative\npossibilities and differ only in terms of the non-qualitative\npossibilities they include. So, while most everyone holds that there\nare maximal possibilities that differ qualitatively and\nnon-qualitatively from actuality, haecceitistic differences are\ndistinctive: they divide maximal possibilities that differ only\nnon-qualitatively.\n\nAlthough Possibility Haecceitism requires quantification over\npossibilities, it remains silent about possible worlds. But, for most\nrealists about possible worlds, quantification over maximal\npossibilities requires or is simply equivalent to quantification over\npossible worlds. Typically, such realist views of possible worlds\nidentify each maximal possibility with a unique possible world and\nnon-maximal possibilities with sets of possible worlds. And, while\nviews that reduce possibilities to possible worlds can employ\nPossibility Haecceitism to express haecceitism, some might be tempted\nto interpret haecceitism as a thesis about qualitatively indiscernible\nworlds. Such a view would attempt to formulate haecceitism as the\nfollowing thesis:\n\nWorld Indiscernibility: There are distinct possible\nworlds that are qualitatively indiscernible.\n\nAs Lewis (1986: 220\u2013247) and Skow (2008) point out, however,\nWorld Indiscernibility is a misleading way to express haecceitism\ngiven certain views about possible worlds.\n\nAccording to ersatzist views, which identify possible worlds\nwith abstract entities like sentence-types, properties, propositions,\nor sets, the truth of World Indiscernibility will turn, not on whether\nthere are distinctively haecceitistic possibilities, but on whether\nsuch entities are qualitatively indiscernible from one another.\n(Qualitatively indiscernible entities share all their\nqualitative properties, while qualitative duplicates share\nonly their intrinsic qualitative properties.) So, if one holds that\nsets or propositions have no qualitative features, then World\nIndiscernibility is true, regardless of one\u2019s views about what\nis and what is not possible. So, for many ersatzists, the status of\nWorld Indiscernibility does not depend upon any distinctive modal\ncommitments, but is settled by apparently orthogonal questions\nregarding the nature of the abstract entities with which possible\nworlds are identified.\n\nIn light of disagreement about which entities play the role of\npossible worlds, no characterization of haecceitism that makes\nsubstantive assumptions about the nature of possible worlds will prove\nacceptable to all ersatzists. (On ersatzism, see Lewis (1986:\n136\u2013142), Divers (2002: 167\u2013292), and Sider (2002).)\nDespite this, competing ersatzist views can employ their own\ndistinctive resources to provide formulations of haecceitism. For\ninstance, if possible worlds are identified with maximal consistent\nsets of propositions, haecceitism can be taken as the claim that there\nare distinct maximal consistent sets of propositions that include the\nsame qualitative propositions but different non-qualitative\npropositions. For other versions of ersatzism, alternative strategies\nfor formulating haecceitism that appeal to properties, sets, or other\nentities are available, but none have a plausible claim to being a\nmetaphysically neutral expression of haecceitism.\n\nAlthough formulations of haecceitism tailored to various ersatzist\nviews differ significantly, they typically share a commitment to a\none-one correspondence between possible worlds and maximal\npossibilities. This correspondence allows ersatzists to treat talk of\nmaximal possibilities and possible worlds as largely interchangeable\nfor most theoretical purposes. Ersatzists who accept Possibility\nHaecceitism therefore commonly endorse the following thesis:\n\nWorld Haecceitism: There are distinct maximal\npossibilities that differ only haecceitistically and there is a\none-to-one correspondence between possible worlds and the maximal\npossibilities they represent.\n\nErzatzists can, however, reject World Haecceitism, and, as we\u2019ll\nsee below, the resulting view is an analogue of the Lewisian modal\nrealist\u2019s \u201ccheap haecceitism.\u201d But, as should be\nclear from the preceding, whether a given formulation of haecceitism\nis an apt one crucially depends upon the background metaphysics of\npossibilities and possible worlds.\n\nOn issues that arise in formulating haecceitism, see Lewis (1986:\n220\u2013247), Russell (2013a), Skow (2008, 2011), and Stalnaker\n(2011). Kaplan (1975) is an importantly early contribution where,\namong other things, Kaplan attributes the use of the label\n\u2018haecceitism\u2019 to R.M. Adams. On the ways in which\nKaplan\u2019s use of \u2018haecceitism\u2019 departs from\nnow-standard uses, see Stalnaker (2011: 54\u201362). For other issues\nin characterizing haecceitism, see Graff Fara (2009), Torza\n(2012) and Scarpati (2021).\n1.2. Haecceitism and Modal Realism\n\nWhile ersatzist views identify possible worlds with abstract entities,\nLewisian modal realism identifies possible worlds with maximal sums of\n(analogically) spatiotemporally interrelated entities. According to\nLewisian modal realism, for any way things could have been, there is\nsome possible world that represents that possibility. Moreover, these\npossible worlds are no less \u201creal\u201d or concrete than our\nactual world. (Lewis characterizes these possible worlds as\n\u201cconcrete\u201d only with reservation, given competing,\nnon-equivalent conceptions of the abstract-concrete distinction.)\n\nWithin Lewisian modal realism, de re modality is analyzed in\nterms of Lewis\u2019 distinctive and controversial counterpart\ntheory. According to counterpart theory, ordinary individuals are\nnot numerically identical or \u201cbilocated\u201d across possible\nworlds. Instead, possible individuals are worldbound, existing in only\none world, and possess their de re modal properties in virtue\nof bearing counterpart relations to other possible entities. Roughly\nput, counterpart theory holds that an individual \\(a\\) is possibly\n\\(F\\) if and only if \\(a\\) has a counterpart that is \\(F\\), where\ncounterpart relations are relations of qualitative resemblance between\npossible individuals. So, according to Lewis\u2019\ncounterpart-theoretic treatment of de re modality, it is true\nthat Obama could have been a doctor if and only if there is some\npossible individual that appropriately resembles Obama and is a\ndoctor. De re modality is therefore a matter of resemblance\nrelations between parts of possible worlds although the relevant\nresemblance relations vary from context to context. (Lewis\u2019\nviews on counterpart theory and counterpart relations change over\ntime, see Lewis (1968, 1986). On counterpart theory, see Graff Fara\n(2009), Fara and Williamson (2005), and Hazen (1979).)\n\nSince Lewis analyzes de re representation\u2014i.e., the way\nin which entities represent de re possibilities\u2014in\nterms of qualitative resemblance, counterpart relations never divide\nqualitatively indiscernible entities. Therefore, for any\nqualitatively indiscernible entities \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in a given\ncontext, \\(x\\) is a counterpart of \\(z\\) if and only if \\(y\\) is a\ncounterpart of z. This commitment has serious consequences\nfor the modal realist treatment of haecceitism. In particular, it\nguarantees that qualitatively indiscernible possible worlds do not\ndiffer in terms of what de re possibilities they represent.\nLewis therefore endorses the following thesis about the connection\nbetween qualitative properties and what de re possibilities a\nworld represents:\n\nQualitative Supervenience: Facts about what worlds\nrepresent de re supervene upon facts about the qualitative\nproperties of worlds.\n\nAs Lewis uses \u201chaecceitism\u201d, it is the denial of\nQualitative Supervenience and therefore the claim that non-qualitative\nfeatures of worlds at least partially determine what worlds represent\nde re. (On the relation of supervenience, see the entry by\nMcLaughlin and Bennett.) For modal realists who would reject\nQualitative Supervenience, qualitatively indiscernible possible worlds\ncan differ with respect to which de re possibilities they\nrepresent. Non-Lewisian modal realists of this sort can\ntherefore hold qualitatively indiscernible possible worlds to\nrepresent maximal possibilities that differ haecceitistically. But,\nsince Lewis endorses Qualitative Supervenience, he claims that\nqualitatively indiscernible worlds represent the very same\npossibilities. Positing qualitative indiscernible worlds therefore\nprovides Lewis with no additional resource for making sense of\nhaecceitistic differences. (Lewis is officially agnostic about whether\nthere are any qualitatively indiscernible worlds. See Lewis (1986:\n224).) As a consequence, Lewis holds that we go wrong in assimilating\nquestions of haecceitism to questions about qualitatively\nindiscernible worlds. For Lewis, haecceitism is an issue regarding how\npossible worlds represent de re possibilities. So, even if\nLewis were to posit distinct yet qualitatively indiscernible worlds,\nthey would differ non-qualitatively but not haecceitistically\nin the Lewisian sense.\n\nSince qualitatively indiscernible worlds are no help to Lewis in\naccounting for haecceitistic possibilities\u2014e.g., where two twins\nswap their qualitative roles\u2014and Lewis does take these to\nbe genuine possibilities, he offers an important modification to his\nearlier version of counterpart theory that seeks to accommodate such\npossibilities. Lewis\u2019 modified counterpart theory permits\nindividuals to have multiple counterparts within the actual world.\n(See Lewis (1967, 1983, and 1986).) So, in the case of our two twins,\nthe firstborn twin has its second-born twin as one of its\ncounterparts. In certain linguistic contexts, the second-born twin\ntherefore represents a possibility for the firstborn\u2014namely, the\npossibility of occupying precisely the qualitative role of the\nsecond-born twin. In this way, the actual world and its parts will, in\nsuitable contexts, represent, not only the actualized maximal\npossibility, but also maximal possibilities that differ\nhaecceitistically from the actualized maximal possibility. Context\npermitting, each possible world can therefore represent a plurality of\nmaximal possibilities each of which differ haecceitistically from one\nanother. And, since Lewis\u2019 modified counterpart theory holds a\nsingle possible world and its parts to represent distinct maximal\npossibilities that differ haecceitistically, it accommodates the\nrepresentation of such possibilities without multiplying possible\nworlds. Lewis describes this view as \u201chaecceitism on the\ncheap.\u201d Understood in terms set out above, this \u201ccheap\nsubstitute for haecceitism\u201d entails Possibility Haecceitism yet\nrejects World Haecceitism.\n\nIn denying World Haecceitism, Lewis forgoes a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between maximal possibilities and possible worlds. This\nfeature proves significant in several discussions about the tenability\nof \u201ccheap haecceitism.\u201d Graff Fara (2009) argues that, by\nrejecting World Haecceitism, cheap haecceitism cannot satisfactorily\ninterpret modal logic enriched with an actuality operator. Kment\n(2012) also argues that cheap haecceitism delivers an inadequate\ntreatment of chances and counterfactuals, while Stalnaker (2008:\n69\u201371) suggests that semantic considerations support World\nHaecceitism over cheap haecceitism. On early challenges to counterpart\ntheory, see Kripke (1980) and Hazen (1979). On counterpart theory,\nactuality, and haecceitism, see Baltimore (2014), Cowling (2013), and\nRussell (2013a, 2013b).\n2. Haecceities and Haecceitism\n\nThis section discusses the connection between haecceitism and\nhaecceities as well as some of the central issues regarding\nhaecceities and other non-qualitative properties.\n\nConsider once again the haecceitistic possibility according to which\nyou do not exist and a different individual, Double, instantiates all\nof your actual qualitative properties. A natural way to describe this\npossibility is as one where the distribution of qualitative\nproperties is just as it actually is, but where\nnon-qualitative properties are distributed differently. In\nparticular, this alleged possibility is one according to which your\nhaecceity goes uninstantiated and the haecceity of a\nnon-actual individual, Double, is instantiated in its place.\n\nSince haecceities like being Napoleon and being identical\nto Socrates are properties uniquely tied to specific individuals,\nhaecceitistic differences are naturally explained in terms of\ndifferences in the distribution of haecceities. These properties,\nsometimes called \u201cthisnesses\u201d or \u201cindividual\nessences\u201d, are typically thought to have the existence of the\nrelevant individuals as a necessary and sufficient condition for their\ninstantiation. So, for example, if Napoleon exists, then, necessarily,\nexactly one thing, Napoleon, instantiates being Napoleon and,\nif Napoleon does not exist, nothing instantiates being\nNapoleon. In addition, facts about the distribution of other\nnon-qualitative properties\u2014e.g., being five feet from\nNapoleon\u2014are necessitated by the distribution of\nhaecceities and qualitative properties. (Here, talk of\n\u2018properties\u2019 should be interpreted in the broad sense\nincluding monadic properties as well as \\(n\\)-adic relations.) Most\nhaecceitistic differences will therefore involve differences in the\ndistribution of haecceities as well as additional non-qualitative\nproperties like being five feet from Napoleon.\n\nWhile haecceitistic differences are commonly explained in terms of the\ndistribution of haecceities, haecceitism is not merely the view that\nhaecceities exist. To see why, notice that nominalists who deny the\nexistence of properties might nevertheless accept the modal\ncommitments of haecceitism, claiming that things could have been\ndifferent non-qualitatively without being different qualitatively. In\naddition, those who affirm the existence of haecceities and other\nnon-qualitative properties might still go on to reject the distinctive\nmodal commitments of haecceitism (e.g., denying that things could\ndiffer non-qualitatively without differing qualitatively). So,\nalthough it is common for haecceitists to posit haecceities and employ\nthem in characterizing haecceitistic differences, haecceitism is, in\nprinciple, independent of realism about haecceities given\nhaecceitism\u2019s ineliminable modal component.\n\nAlthough haecceitism is not merely realism about haecceities, the\nmetaphysics of haecceities and non-qualitative properties is still\nrelevant for understanding haecceitism. Perhaps most importantly, some\naccount of the qualitative/non-qualitative distinction is needed to\ninterpret the thesis of haecceitism. Typically, this distinction is\nintroduced by way of example with haecceities like being\nNapoleon taken as paradigmatic non-qualitative properties and\nproperties like mass and charge taken as\nparadigmatic qualitative properties. When moving beyond these\nexamples, other non-qualitative properties are usually held to share\nhaecceities\u2019 dependence upon specific individuals. For example,\nbeing five feet from Napoleon is plausibly thought to require\nthe existence of Napoleon while a qualitative property like being\nfive grams mass requires the existence of no specific individual.\nTerminologically, non-qualitative properties exhibiting this kind of\ndependence are sometimes labeled \u201cimpure properties\u201d,\n\u201cidentity properties\u201d, or \u201chaecceitistic\nproperties\u201d, where \u201chaecceity\u201d is usually reserved\nproperties like being Napoleon.\n\nAttempts at a philosophical analysis of the\nqualitative/non-qualitative distinction often take the connection\nbetween non-qualitative properties and specific individuals as a\nstarting point. For example, Hawthorne (2006: 8) says:\n\u201chaecceitistic properties\u2014such as being identical to\nJohn or being the daughter of Jim\u2014are those which,\nin some intuitive way, make direct reference to a particular\nindividual(s).\u201d But, while rough characterizations of this sort\nleave the (non-)qualitative status of other kinds of properties\nindeterminate or unclear, reductive analyses have been proposed with\nthe aim of providing a comprehensive account of the distinction. Adams\n(1979: 7\u20139) considers an account of the distinction that ties\nnon-qualitative properties to certain kinds of linguistic items. Lewis\n(1986, 2002) endorses views on which qualitative properties supervene\nupon or are appropriately definable in terms of a distinctive class of\n\u201cperfectly natural properties.\u201d Still other\nviews\u2014e.g., Rosenkrantz (1979)\u2014aim to analyze the\ndependence of non-qualitative properties on individuals and\ndistinguish non-qualitative properties in terms of this dependence. In\ncontrast, Diekemper (2009) and Cowling (2015) endorse primitivism\nabout the distinction between qualitative and non-qualitative\nproperties, taking it instead as irreducible or metaphysically\nfundamental. But, regardless of one\u2019s preferred view of the\ndistinction, some account is owed of the qualitative status of\nnon-paradigmatic cases including modal properties like being\npossibly a statue, broadly logical properties like being\nself-identical, and, for those impressed by the analogies between\nindividuals and species, certain kind properties like being a\ntiger. (See Cowling (2015), Hoffmann-Kolss (2018), Simmons\n(2020), and Plate (2022) on the distinction.)\n\nDebates about the metaphysical status of haecceities are also bound up\nwith more general debates about the nature of properties\u2014e.g.,\nwhether properties are universals or tropes, in re or\nante rem entities, sparse or abundant, and so on. But,\nregardless of one\u2019s preferred view about the metaphysics of\nproperties, haecceities do seem to have some distinctive features.\nUnlike most other properties, haecceities are not typically thought to\nbe multiply instantiable\u2014i.e., there is exactly one possible\nobject that can instantiate being Napoleon\u2014and, as\ncommonly conceived, haecceities do not (without auxiliary assumptions)\nground qualitative resemblance. So, if one holds that all properties\nmust be multiply instantiable or ground qualitative resemblance, then\none must either reject haecceities or opt for a disunified metaphysics\nof properties. (On some competing views of the metaphysical role of\nhaecceities, see Diekemper (2015).)\n\nWithin leading views of properties, various options are available for\ndeveloping a metaphysics of haecceities. For example, in an effort to\nassimilate haecceities into a class nominalist ontology where\nproperties are identified with sets, Lewis (1986: 225) characterizes\nhaecceities as follows: \u201cSo we get properties that are in no way\nqualitatively delineated, and some of these are haecceities of this-\nand other-worldly individuals. A unit set of an individual is one\nespecially stringent haecceity. Also, for any individual and any\ncounterpart relation, there is the set of that individual together\nwith all its counterparts, and this is a less strict sort of\nhaecceity.\u201d The resulting view takes our talk of haecceities to\nslide between talk of properties distinctive to each worldbound\nindividual and talk of properties shared by individuals unified by a\ncommon counterpart relation. (On the broader conception, haecceities\nare non-qualitative in nature, while, on the narrower conception,\nhaecceities end up being qualitative, provided there are no\nqualitatively indiscernible worlds.) In contrast to this Lewisian\nview, other views attribute a more significant metaphysical role to\nhaecceities, taking haecceities to individuate or determine the\nidentity of entities and therefore figure into a metaphysical\nexplanation of facts about identity and individuation. (Bowers and\nWallace (2018) present an argument against certain conceptions of\nhaecceities and their theoretical role. See Skiles (2019) for a\nresponse.)\n\nViews that take haecceities to provide metaphysical explanations of\nthe identity of individuals suggest a noteworthy connection between\nhaecceitism and fundamentality. In particular, if we assume that the\nstock of the world\u2019s fundamental properties (provided there are\nsuch properties) suffices to fix the distribution of absolutely all\nproperties, then haecceitism guarantees that qualitative properties\ncannot, on their own, fix the distribution of non-qualitative\nproperties like haecceities. As a consequence, haecceitism points\ntoward the conclusion that some non-qualitative properties are\nfundamental. So, for those who hold that fundamental properties are\nexclusively qualitative, either the assumed conception of\nfundamentality or haecceitism must be rejected. For the committed\nhaecceitist, a remaining option admits fundamental qualitative as well\nas fundamental non-qualitative properties. On the fundamentality of\nnon-qualitative properties, see Bacon (2019) and Simmons (2021).\n\nA further notable debate about the metaphysics of haecceities concerns\ntheir modal status. Some, like Plantinga (1974), take haecceities to\nexist necessarily. So, while being Napoleon goes\nuninstantiated in possible worlds without Napoleon, it nevertheless\nexists in such worlds. According to other views like that of Adams\n(1981), haecceities are contingent existents, existing only in those\nworlds where their bearers exist. So, although being Napoleon\nactually exists, it neither exists nor is instantiated at worlds\nwithout Napoleon. For discussion of this debate and cognate ones, see\nMcMichael (1983) and Diekemper (2015).\n\nOn the general metaphysics of haecceities, see Adams (1979, 1981),\nCover and O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne (1997), Lewis (1986), Swinburne\n(1995), and Rosenkrantz (1993). On epistemological and metaphysical\nissues about haecceities\u2014e.g., whether individuals can be\nacquainted with the haecceities of other individuals\u2014see\nRosenkrantz (1993). On haecceities and the identity of indiscernibles,\nsee Robinson (2000). On haecceities of mathematical entities and their\nrole in mathematical structuralism, see Shapiro (2006: 139) and Menzel\n(2018). See McDaniel (2017: 193\u2013194) for discussion of\nhow haecceities might be identified with individual ways of\nbeing.\n3. Haecceitism and Essentialism\n\nHaecceitism and essentialism are controversial theses about de\nre modality. This section briefly introduces essentialism and\nthen examines its interaction with haecceitism.\n\nThe essential properties of an individual are properties it\ncannot exist without instantiating. In contrast, its\naccidental properties are those properties that are not\nessential to it. (According to the modal view of essence, this modal\ncharacterization of essential properties provides necessary and\nsufficient conditions for essentiality. On non-modal views, this\ncharacterization merely captures a necessary condition. See Fine\n(1994) for the case against the modal view.)\n\nEssentialist theses claim that certain kinds of properties are\nessential to certain kinds of individuals. For example, according to\norigin essentialism, biological individuals have their\nbiological origins essentially. Origin essentialism therefore requires\nthat an individual like George W. Bush have his actual biological\norigins\u2014in this case, Barbara and George H.W. Bush\u2014in any\npossible world in which it exists. (On origin essentialism, see Kripke\n(1979) and Robertson (1998). On other essentialisms, see Cartwright\n(1968) and Mackie (2006). For a comprehensive discussion of varieties\nof essentialism, see Dorr, Hawthorne, and Yli-Vakkuri (2021).)\n\nEssentialist theses come in \u201cstronger\u201d and\n\u201cweaker\u201d forms. Weaker, less interesting forms of\nessentialism require that all individuals instantiate indiscriminate\nproperties like being self-identical or being such that\n\\(2+2=4\\). (Again, non-modalists like Fine (1994) deny these\nnecessary properties are properly counted as essential to all entities\neven while being such that \\(2+2=4\\) might be essential to\nthe number two.) Stronger, more interesting versions of essentialism\nlike origin essentialism ascribe distinctive essential properties to\nindividuals. The strongest form of essentialism is\nhyperessentialism, according to which each individual has all\nof its properties essentially. So, for any individual, there is only\nway that that individual can be.\n\nIntuitively, essentialism limits the de re possibilities for\nindividuals, while haecceitism extends the de re\npossibilities for individuals by admitting contentious\npossibilities\u2014e.g., the possibility where you swap qualitative\nroles with Obama. It is important to note, however, that even the\nstrongest versions of essentialism, hyperessentialism, do not rule out\nhaecceitism. For, while hyperessentialism does rule out haecceitistic\ndifferences where you have different properties, it does not\nrule out a \u201cmass replacement\u201d\u2014i.e., an alternative\nmaximal possibility where wholly different individuals occupy each of\nthe qualitative roles occupied in the actual world. These maximal\npossibilities differ haecceitistically even while there is no\nviolation of essence, since no individual exists according to more\nthan a single world. (Those who reject possibilities involving\nnon-actual or \u201calien\u201d individuals would, however, have the\nmakings of an argument from hyperessentialism to anti-haecceitism.)\nAlthough essentialism provides no direct argument against haecceitism,\nhyperessentialism and other strong versions of essentialism do\npreclude certain kinds of haecceitistic differences where individuals\n\u201cswap\u201d qualitative roles. For example, just as\nhyperessentialism rules out any haecceitistic possibilities where you\nhave a different qualitative role, origin essentialism rules out\nhaecceitistic differences that involve organisms having anything other\nthan their actual biological origins. For this reason, a commitment to\nstrong versions of essentialism will constrain the range of admissible\nhaecceitistic differences.\n\nWeak forms of essentialism have few consequences for haecceitism.\nMoreover, the thesis that individuals have their haecceities\nessentially is often taken as a prerequisite for a commitment to\nhaecceitism, since the thesis sometimes called \u201cextreme\nhaecceitism\u201d holds that haecceities are the only\nessential properties of individuals aside from perfectly general\nproperties instantiated by all entities (e.g., being\nself-identical). According to extreme haecceitists, not only\ncould Napoleon have been a poached egg, the world could have been\nqualitatively just as it actually is but such that a poached egg and\nNapoleon swap their respective qualitative roles. Extreme haecceitism\nis therefore among the most permissive views about de re\nmodality and admits possibilities where you occupy the qualitative\nroles of a poached egg. For this reason, extreme haecceitism is often\n(albeit confusingly) classified as a version of\n\u201canti-essentialism\u201d, by virtue of denying that individuals\nhave distinctive essences apart from their respective haecceities. (On\nanti-essentialism and extreme haecceitism, see Heller (2005),\nStalnaker (1979), and Lewis (1986). See Mackie (2006) for a defense of\n\u201cminimal essentialism\u201d, according to which individuals\nhave their haecceities and belong to their ontological categories like\nproperty or object essentially.) At the same time,\nextreme haecceitism is typically paired with a commitment to the\nnecessity of identity and distinctness and therefore rules out\npossibilities according to which actually distinct objects are one and\nthe same. A yet more permissive view about de re modality\nmight abandon this commitment, taking even the identity and\ndistinctness of individuals as accidental. (On whether\nanti-essentialism is best paired with the necessity of identity and\ndistinctness, see Nelson (2006). On indvidual essences, see Losonsky\n(1987).)\n\nFinally, while essentialism holds certain properties as\nnecessary for being a specific individual, related\n\u201csufficiency\u201d theses might hold certain properties to be\nsufficient for being a particular individual. If, for\nexample, we take Obama\u2019s actual qualitative role to be a\nsufficient condition for an object to be identical to Obama, we\nthereby rule out possibilities according to which some other\nindividual occupies Obama\u2019s qualitative role. (Sufficiency\ntheses of this sort can be hammered into essentialist theses by\nholding individuals like Obama to have essential properties like\noccupying the qualitative role of the President in 2014 if the\nworld is qualitatively as it actually is.) Theses of this kind\nplay a notable role in certain essentialist arguments\u2014e.g., in\ncertain arguments for origin essentialism\u2014but it remains unclear\nhow such principles might be used to offer a non-question-begging\nargument against haecceitism. (For discussion of sufficiency\nprinciples, see McKay (1986) and Robertson (1998).)\n\nAs just noted, no familiar version of essentialism provides a direct\nargument against absolutely all haecceitistic differences, although\nstrong versions of essentialism will limit the range of admissible\nhaecceitistic differences. In addition, haecceitists typically assume\nat least a modest form of essentialism according to which\nindividuals have their haecceities essentially.\n4. Arguments for Haecceitism\n\nThis section surveys arguments for haecceitism. The most familiar of\nthese are conceivability arguments, which appeal to the apparent\nconceivability or imaginability of maximal possibilities that differ\nhaecceitistically. Another line of defense takes the form of an\nargument usually called \u201cChisholm\u2019s Paradox\u201d, which\nexploits incremental modal variations in order to defend haecceitistic\ndifferences. In addition, one might endorse haecceitism, not on the\nstrength of any distinctive argument, but by a more general appeal to\nmodal intuition, according to which haecceitistic differences simply\nseem possible. This survey of arguments leaves aside the\ngeneral issues in modal epistemology raised by appeals to modal\nintuition, focusing instead on conceivability arguments for\nhaecceitism and Chisholm\u2019s Paradox.\n\nNote, also, that these arguments are most naturally taken as arguments\nfor Possibility Haecceitism rather than, say, World Haecceitism. So\nunderstood, the Lewisian \u201ccheap haecceitist\u201d can, in\nprinciple, accept the conclusions of these arguments even while\ndenying such arguments establish the existence of qualitatively\nindiscernible possible worlds.\n4.1. Conceivability Arguments for Haecceitism\n\nConceivability arguments for haecceitism have two steps. The first\nstep requires our success in conceiving or imagining certain states of\naffairs. The second step requires an inference from the relevant\nconceiving or imagining to the possibility of the states of affairs in\nquestion. Among the wide variety of conceivability arguments for\nhaecceitism, some vary with respect to the kind of conceivability or\nimagination required, while others vary with respect to the kinds of\nstates of affairs involved. (Cowling (2017) offers a taxonomy of these\narguments.) This section sets out some conceivability arguments\noffered in the literature with some limited remarks about their\nsalient differences.\n\nBlack (1952) offers a now-famous conceivability argument against the\nIdentity of Indiscernibles, which appeals to the apparent\nconceivability of a world containing only two indiscernible iron\nspheres. In defending haecceitism, a natural strategy is to extend\nBlack\u2019s case by arguing that, not only can we conceive of a\nworld containing only two indiscernible iron spheres, we can conceive\nof distinct worlds that differ only insofar as these spheres swap\ntheir spatial locations. (Jubien (1993: 41\u201342) discusses an\nargument of this sort.) A closely related argument holds that we can\nconceive of a pair of worlds in which some pair of spheres has been\nreplaced by some other pair of spheres. Granted the conceivability of\nthe states of affairs in question, haecceitism follows. (A related\nline of argument, owing to Adams (1979), is considered below.)\n\nOther arguments appeal to similar states of affairs featuring\nqualitatively indiscernible objects or regions. For example, Melia\n(2003: 162) presents a conceivability argument that requires us to\nconceive of a world that contains a single cylinder on a qualitatively\nhomogeneous plane. Intuitively, there are many possible directions in\nwhich the cylinder could fall, but, since there is no qualitative\nvariation between these possibilities, they can be distinguished only\nhaecceitistically\u2014i.e., with respect to the identity of which\nregions of the plane are occupied by the fallen cylinder.\n\nUnlike the preceding arguments, some conceivability arguments involve\na kind of \u201cinside\u201d or \u201cfirst-personal\u201d\nimagination that requires imagining a state of affairs from the\nperspective of a specific conscious individual. Compare, for example,\nthe act of imagining Napoleon defeated at Waterloo \u201cfrom\nabove\u201d with the act of imagining being Napoleon\ndefeated at Waterloo from the perspective of Napoleon. The distinction\nbetween these imaginative acts is commonly taken as a distinction\nbetween imagining from the outside and imagining from the inside. If\nwe help ourselves to this distinction, it is plausible to view several\nconceivability arguments as relying upon imagination from the inside\nrather than imagination from the outside. (On the distinction between\ninside and outside imagination, see Nichols (2008), Ninan (2009),\nPeacocke (1985), and Velleman (1996).)\n\nLewis (1986: 227) offers an argument of this sort, which we can take\nto involve our imagining a world of one-way eternal recurrence where\nthe history of the actual world repeats itself ad infinitum.\nLewis then suggests that we can successfully imagine ourselves\noccupying different \u201cepochs\u201d\u2014specific recurrences of\nhistory from the inside. And, since we can imagine ourselves occupying\ndifferent epochs, he concludes that some possibilities differ solely\nwith respect to whether one lives in, say, the seventeenth rather than\nthe fortieth epoch. In addition, Lewis (1983, 1986: 239) suggests\nanother conceivability argument that seems to require us\nimagining living as one of a pair of twins. (Whether Lewis thinks any\nrobust imaginative undertaking is required here is unclear, but the\ngeneral features of this particular kind of conceivability argument is\nour interest here.) And, since we can equally well imagine living as\nthe firstborn twin and as the second-born twin while holding the\nqualitative character of the world fixed, it seems that we can\nsuccessfully imagine possibilities that differ only\nhaecceitistically.\n\nAnother kind of conceivability argument requires us to imagine our\nnonexistence in a world qualitatively indiscernible from actuality.\nDifferent views of imagination will deliver importantly different\nverdicts about how, if at all, we might succeed in this imaginative\nundertaking. (It is hard, for example, to see how we might\nsuccessfully imagine our own nonexistence from the inside.) But, among\nothers, Bricker (2007: 130) suggests that a plausible view of de\nre modality must accommodate the possibility of oneself failing\nto exist even while things are qualitatively just as they actually\nare. (On Bricker\u2019s view, this requires only a sufficiently rich\naccount of counterpart relations rather than, say, qualitatively\nindiscernible possible worlds. On imagining one\u2019s own\nnonexistence, see Nichols (2007).)\n\nA final conceivability argument usefully illustrates the intuitive\ndifference between arguments that rely solely upon outside imagination\nand those invoking inside imagination. Adams (1979: 22) presents the\nfollowing conceivability argument:\n\nConsider, again, a possible world \\(w_{1}\\), in which there are two\nqualitatively indiscernible globes; call them Castor and Pollux. Being\nindiscernible, they have of course the same duration; in \\(w_{1}\\)\nboth of them have always existed and always will exist. But it seems\nperfectly possible, logically and metaphysically, that either or both\nof them cease to exist. Let \\(w_{2}\\), then, be a possible world just\nlike \\(w_{1}\\) up to a certain time \\(t\\) at which in \\(w_{2}\\) Castor\nceases to exist while Pollux goes on forever; and let \\(w_{3}\\) be a\npossible world just like \\(w_{2}\\) except that in \\(w_{3}\\) it is\nPollux that ceases to exist at \\(t\\) while Castor goes on forever.\nThat the difference between \\(w_{2}\\) and \\(w_{3}\\) is real, and could\nbe important, becomes vividly clear if we consider that, from the\npoint of view of a person living on Castor before \\(t\\) in \\(w_{1}\\)\nand having (of course) an indiscernible twin on Pollux, it can be seen\nas the difference between being annihilated and somebody else being\nannihilated instead. But there is no qualitative difference between\n\\(w_{2}\\) and \\(w_{3}\\).\n\n\nAdams explicitly marks the move from outside to inside imagination,\nnoting that the haecceitistic difference \u201cbecomes vividly\nclear\u201d when we imagine the relevant states of affairs from the\nperspective of the individuals involved. (See Melia (1999: 650) for a\nsimilar argument.) \n\nIn addressing these and other conceivability arguments for\nhaecceitism, anti-haecceitists have two primary lines of defense.\nAccording to the first kind of response, the evidential connection\nbetween conceivability and possibility is rejected\u2014e.g., by\ndenying that conceivability of the relevant state of affairs is\ngrounds for taking the state of affairs in question to be\npossible.\n\nAccording to a second line of response, the apparent conceivability of\nthe relevant states of affairs is merely apparent. To this end, the\nanti-haecceitist denies that individuals successfully conceive of or\nimagine the states of affairs required to establish haecceitism.\nResponses of this sort hold agents to be mistaken about the content of\ntheir imaginings and, as a consequence, mistaken in believing\nthemselves to conceive of states of affairs that differ\nhaecceitistically.\n4.2. Chisholm\u2019s Paradox\n\nChisholm\u2019s Paradox, presented in Chisholm (1967), begins\ninnocuously enough. Suppose that individuals are identical across\npossible worlds such that de re modal claims like \u201cFred\ncould have been taller\u201d are true only in case there is some\npossible world where the very same individual, in this case, Fred, is\ntaller than he is in the actual world. Now, consider that two actual\nindividuals, Adam and Noah, could have had slightly different\nqualitative properties. For example, Adam, instead of dying at age\n930, could have died at age 931. Similarly, Noah, instead of dying at\nage 950, could have died at age 949. If Adam and Noah can tolerate\nthese incremental \u201cchanges\u201d to each of their qualitative\nprofiles, it seems that had they been a different way than they\nactually are, they could have tolerated even further incremental\nchanges.\n\nNow, if we allow incremental possible changes to the ways that Adam\nand Noah could have been and accept the transitivity of identity, we\nare committed to a finite series of incremental changes that ends in a\npossible world where Adam has all the qualitative properties Noah\nactually has and Noah has all the qualitative properties that Adam\nactually has. This is because the relevant iterated modal claim\n\u201cAdam could have been such that he could have been such that he\ncould have been such\u201d is, by our initial assumption, true in\nvirtue of one and the same individual, Adam, existing at different\npossible worlds. So, if Adam and Noah could be incrementally different\nand the individuals they could have been could also be incrementally\ndifferent, we must accept that Adam and Noah could \u201cswap\u201d\ntheir respective qualitative properties. And, if so, there is a\nmaximal possibility that differs from actuality only in haecceitistic\nterms\u2014that is, it differs only in terms of which individuals\ninstantiate which qualitative profiles.\n\nWe can clarify Chisholm\u2019s Paradox as a particular schema of\nmodal inference. This schema involves a two-place predicate that\nrelates an individual and either their actual qualitative properties\n(represented as \\(p_{1})\\) or their possible qualitative properties\n(represented as successors up to \\(p_{n})\\), where differences between\n\\(p_{X}\\) and \\(p_{X+1}\\) are small increments of qualitative\nproperties. In this way, Chisholm\u2019s Paradox purports to\nestablish that a particular individual might have had different\nqualitative properties and, through iteration and the transitivity of\nidentity, that it might have had precisely the qualitative properties\nsome other individual actually has. Following Salmon (1986) and Forbes\n(1984), we can present Chisholm\u2019s Paradox as follows:\n\n(P1) \\(M(a, p_{1})\\)\n\n(P2) \\(\\Box(M(a, p_{1})\n\\rightarrow \\Diamond M(a, p_{2}))\\) \n(P3) \\(\\Box(M(a, p_{2})\n\\rightarrow \\Diamond M(a, p_{3}))\\) \n\u2026  \n(P\\(n\\)) \\(\\Box(M(a,\np_{n-1}) \\rightarrow \\Diamond M(a, p_{n}))\\) \n(C1) \\(\\Diamond M(a,\np_{n})\\) \n\n\nIn the version presented in Chisholm (1967), \\(M\\) is the relation\ninstantiates each member of; \\(a\\) is the individual Adam;\n\\(p_{1}\\) is the set of Adam\u2019s actual qualitative properties;\n\\(p_{n}\\) is the set of Noah\u2019s actual qualitative properties.\nChisholm\u2019s Paradox therefore involves\n\na claim about the actual world, P1,\na lengthy yet finite series of apparently innocuous claims about\nhow individuals could have been slightly different than they are,\nand\nthe conclusion that Adam could have all the actual qualitative\nproperties instantiated by Noah.\n\n\nIf Chisholm\u2019s Paradox is sound, the conclusion that Adam could\noccupy Noah\u2019s qualitative role entails haecceitism. This is\nbecause Noah\u2019s qualitative properties include, not only\nNoah\u2019s intrinsic properties, but also Noah\u2019s extrinsic\nproperties (e.g., being such that there are seven\ncontinents), which suffice to fix the qualitative character of\nthe world. As result, if Adam could instantiate Noah\u2019s actual\nqualitative properties, then the world in which he does so must be\nqualitatively just like the actual world. Such a possibility therefore\nentails that some maximal possibilities differ haecceitistically.\n\nIf successful, Chisholm\u2019s Paradox seems to establish not only\nhaecceitism, but also an extreme form of\n\u201canti-essentialism\u201d like extreme haecceitism. Since we can\nconstruct a \u201cChisholm-sequence\u201d with any two individuals,\nunqualified endorsement of Chisholm\u2019s Paradox guarantees that,\nfor any individuals, there is a possible world where those individuals\nswap their qualitative profiles. For instance, there would be a\npossible world where Obama occupies the qualitative profile of the\nEiffel Tower and vice versa. As a result, neither the Eiffel\nTower nor Obama can have any distinctive qualitative properties\nessentially.\n\nWhile some have taken haecceitism and this anti-essentialism (or\n\u201cminimal essentialism\u201d) to be a natural package, it is\nimportant to note that they are separate conclusions. One might reject\ncertain instances of Chisholm\u2019s Paradox that involve teacups\nswapping qualitative roles with tornadoes, but admit that other\ninstances succeed in showing that distinct teacups might have swapped\ntheir qualitative roles. Despite this, responses to Chisholm\u2019s\nParadox are typically motivated by efforts to sustain a commitment to\nessentialism rather than avoid commitment to haecceitism. To this end,\nsome follow Salmon (1986) in holding the assumption of an\n\\(\\mathbf{S5}\\) modal logic that validates \\(\\Diamond P\\rightarrow\n\\Box \\Diamond P\\) as the underlying culprit. (Salmon (1989, 1993)\nrejects, not only \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\), but \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) axioms.) Such responses opt for a weaker logic that\navoids (at least) the transitivity of the accessibility relation\nbetween possible worlds. Other responses turn on the finer points of\nde re representation. For example, while Lewis\u2019\ncounterpart theory can, in non-standard contexts, accommodate\nanti-essentialism, the fact that our ordinary contextual standards\nrule out extreme de re possibilities is explained by the\nintransitivity of the counterpart relation between individuals.\nAnother potential response to Chisholm\u2019s Paradox would be akin\nto those offered in dealing with the sorites\u2014e.g.,\nholding that some premises of Chisholm\u2019s Paradox are false even\nwhile we are in no position to specify precisely which ones. Yet\nanother line of response takes Chisholm\u2019s Paradox to deliver the\ncorrect verdict: there are no interesting qualitative essential\nproperties of individuals. For example, some like Mackie (2006) take\nChisholm\u2019s Paradox to lend support to a minimal essentialist\nview, according to which any object might occupy any given qualitative\nrole, provided it retains its non-qualitative haecceity. See Bassford\n(2020) and Dorr, Hawthorne, and Yli-Vakkuri (2021: 122-219) for\nadditional discussion.\n5. Arguments against Haecceitism\n\nThis section surveys arguments for anti-haecceitism. It is worth\nnoting, however, that for many anti-haecceitists, the denial that any\nmaximal possibilities differ haecceitistically issues from a broader\ncommitment regarding ontology or modality. (Anti-haecceitists include\nDasgupta (2009), Forbes (1985), and Robinson (1989: 400).) Consider,\nfor example, generalism, according to which there are no individuals.\nInstead, the world is exhaustively general, comprising facts about the\ndistribution of qualitative properties without any facts about\nindividuals. Since haecceitism presupposes that there are maximal\npossibilities that differ solely regarding the identity of\nindividuals, generalism thereby rules out haecceitism. (On generalism,\nsee Dasgupta (2009), Turner (2017), and Russell (2018). For discussion\nof how generalists might accommodate haecceitism, see Diehl (2022).)\nSimilarly, necessitarians hold that there are no non-actual maximal\npossibilities. Consequently, all truths are necessarily true, so there\nis only one way things could have been. And, since haecceitism\nrequires that there are distinct maximal possibilities,\nnecessitarianism rules out haecceitism.\n\nOther broad metaphysical commitments have also been claimed to support\nanti-haecceitism. Armstrong (1989: 57\u201361) claims that\nanti-haecceitism best squares with his antecedent naturalist and\ncombinatorialist commitments. And, just as modal intuition is\ncommonly taken as the grounds for endorsing haecceitism, modal\nintuition is very often taken as grounds for endorsing\nanti-haecceitism. For example, while Hofweber (2005: 27) is officially\nneutral on haecceitism, he nicely summarizes the standard\nanti-haecceitist appeal to modal intuition:\n\nAfter all, could it really be that after God specified what kinds of\nthings there are and what purely qualitative properties and relations\nthese things instantiate, he still had many options left open about\nwhich objects should exist in such a world? Could God have created a\nworld exactly like ours in all qualitative respects, but with the only\ndifference that the thing which actually is Bush would be Clinton and\nthe other way round? And could God thus create infinitely many worlds\nthat are qualitatively identical and differ only in which objects\nexist in them? It seems not.\n\n\nAnti-haecceitists who appeal to modal intuitions in this way owe some\nresponse to the arguments set out in the previous section. Moreover,\nsince modal intuitions of haecceitists and anti-haecceitists are at\ndirect odds, assessing the evidential weight and proper assessment of\nthese intuitions points towards deep methodological waters. But,\nrather than taking up these issues, it will be useful to focus on two\ndirect lines of arguments for anti-haecceitism.\n5.1. Against Bare Identities\n\nOne important argument against haecceitism turns on issues about the\ngrounding of identity facts\u2014i.e., facts about the identity of\nindividuals. Set out in Forbes (1985: 128), this argument holds\nhaecceitism to require what we can call bare identity facts,\nwhere such facts concern the identity of individuals but are not\ngrounded in the qualitative features of the world. Since these\nidentity facts can vary without any difference in qualitative\ncharacter, they are alleged to resist metaphysical explanation. On\nthis front, Forbes remarks as follows:\n\nConsider the supposition that things could have been exactly as they\nare except that the steel tower in Paris opposite the Palais de\nChaillot is different from the one actually there. To make sense of\nthis supposition, it is not permitted to imagine that the tower is\nmade of different metal from the metal which actually constitutes it,\nor that it has a different design, or designer, or history. The only\nrespect in which the imagined situation is to differ from the actual\nworld is in the identity of the tower. The extent to which such a\ndifference seems unintelligible is some measure of the plausibility of\nthe view that transworld differences must be grounded.\n\n\nOn one construal of Forbes\u2019 argument, haecceitistic differences\nare unintelligible and therefore objectionable because all identity\nfacts must be grounded in facts about the qualitative character of the\nworld. Accordingly, Forbes\u2019 argument requires a commitment to\nthe sufficiency of qualitative facts to account for all facts about\nthe identity of individuals. Such a commitment rules out haecceitistic\ndifferences, but raises questions about the tenability of the relevant\nconstraint on identity facts. What, if anything, can be taken to\nground the facts about the identity of qualitative properties? And, if\nthere are at least some ungrounded identity facts, what precisely\nmakes bare identity facts objectionable? (On Forbes\u2019 argument,\nsee Bricker (1988), Yablo (1988), and Mackie (2007).)\nAlthough the denial of bare identities is not strictly equivalent\nto the denial of haecceitism, it is a small step from the former to\nthe latter. Accordingly, some commentators have raised concerns that\nan argument for anti-haecceitism premised upon objections to bare\nidentities is at risk of begging the question. On the general\nquestion of whether identity facts admit of explanation, see Shumener\n(2020).\n5.2. Arguments from the Identity of Indiscernibles\n\nThe Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles (hereafter, PII) holds\nthat, if any objects share all the same properties, these objects are\nidentical. To avoid triviality, PII is typically interpreted with the\ndomain of properties restricted to what are usually taken to be\nqualitative properties. (On PII, see Rodriguez-Pererya (2010, 2022),\nHawley (2009) and Della Rocca (2005).)\n\nSince haecceitistic differences concern qualitatively indiscernible\npossibilities, it is tempting to think that, since PII rules out the\nexistence of qualitatively indiscernible objects, it thereby\nundermines haecceitism. Assessing this line of argument raises issues\nabout the proper formulation of PII as well as radically different\nviews about the nature of possible worlds. To see how these issues\nhang together, it is useful to first consider how PII might be used to\nargue against haecceitism within the context of Lewisian Modal\nRealism. In doing so, two versions of PII need to be\ndistinguished.\n\nAccording to the first version regarding objects within a given world,\nPII-Objects, there are no qualitatively indiscernible objects\nwithin a single possible world. PII-Objects therefore rules out states\nof affairs like those suggested in Black (1952) involving\nqualitatively indiscernible iron spheres. Although PII-Objects ensures\nthat no object has a qualitatively indiscernible worldmate, it is\nneutral on whether or not there are qualitatively indiscernible\nworlds, leaving open whether there are distinct yet qualitatively\nindiscernible worlds.\n\nA second version of PII, PII-Worlds, concerns possible worlds\nthemselves rather than the individuals within them. It holds that\nthere are no distinct yet qualitatively indiscernible worlds, but it\nis neutral on whether there are qualitatively indiscernible\nindividuals within a single world. PII-Worlds therefore leaves open\nwhether there are worlds like Blacks\u2019 two-sphere scenario in\nwhich there are distinct qualitatively indiscernible objects.\n\nHaving now distinguished these principles, we can consider whether\neither provides an argument against haecceitism. As Lewis (1986: 224)\nnotes, PII-Objects leaves haecceitism untouched, since it is\ncompatible with the possibility of qualitatively indiscernible worlds\nthat differ haecceitistically. And, while PII-Worlds rules out\nqualitatively indiscernible worlds rather than objects within worlds,\nLewis\u2019 cheap haecceitism still permits the representation of\nmaximal possibilities that differ haecceitistically even without\npositing qualitatively indiscernible worlds. It looks, then, like PII\nis not a plausible starting point for a case against Possibility\nHaecceitism within Lewisian Modal Realism.\n\nDoes an argument against haecceitism on the basis of PII fare any\nbetter within an ersatz view of possible worlds? It\u2019s tough to\nsay. As noted in Section One, different versions of ersatzism deliver\ndifferent verdicts about whether possible worlds are qualitatively\nindiscernible from one another. For example, if one holds that all\npropositions are qualitatively indiscernible, an unrestricted\napplication of PII will cause broad problems for such a\nview\u2014e.g., by ruling out the existence of more than a single\npossible world. On other ersatzist views, according to which possible\nworlds have distinctive qualitative characters even while they\nrepresent maximal possibilities that differ haecceitistically, PII\nwill not rule out a commitment to haecceitism. In light of these\nconsequences, PII would need to be applied, not to the possible worlds\nof the ersatzist, but, rather, to the possibilities they represent.\nAnd, of course, if the ersatzist denies that there are maximal\npossibilities that differ without differing qualitatively, they reject\nhaecceitism. But, since the relevant principle used to undercut\nhaecceitism is not, strictly speaking, PII regarding objects or worlds\nbut instead possibilities, it is unclear whether it merely collapses\ninto the straightforward denial of haecceitism. A worry, then, is that\nthe version of PII that suffices to undercut haecceitism is so close\nto the thesis of anti-haecceitism that any argument that proceeds from\nsuch a principle merely begs the question. In addition, it is unclear\nif such a principle can be plausibly motivated without leading to\nobjectionable modal commitments by requiring one to reject the kinds\nof possibilities that Black (1952) notes. (On the case for Black-style\npossibilities involving qualitatively indiscernible objects, see Adams\n(1979: 17\u201319).)\n6. Restricting Haecceitism\n\nThe preceding arguments aim to show that there are no haecceitistic\ndifferences of any kind between maximal possibilities. Other arguments\nare narrower in scope and aim to establish a weaker thesis: that\ncertain kinds of haecceitistic differences are spurious. If\nsuccessful, these arguments will rule out only some kinds of\nhaecceitistic differences while falling short of providing a perfectly\ngeneral case against haecceitism. To get a sense of restricted or\ndomain-specific (anti-)haecceitisms, it will be useful to focus on one\nexample where restricted, domain-specific theses of haecceitism or\nanti-haecceitism play a notable role in a core metaphysical\ndebate.\n\nConsider the kind of possibility exploited in a rough approximation of\nLeibniz\u2019s shift argument against absolute space: If absolute\nspace exists, then there is a non-actual possibility, according to\nwhich all actual objects are uniformly shifted five feet from their\nactual spatial positions. Such a possibility\u2014let us\nsuppose\u2014differs only haecceitistically from actuality. (For more\non haecceitism and spacetime, see Section 7 and the references\ntherein. On Leibnizian shift arguments, see Russell (2014).)\n\nIn considering this alleged possibility, a range of responses are\navailable: For those who believe realism about space requires\naccepting such possibilities, but find such possibilities incredible,\nthe denial of absolute space is an available response. For other\nrealists about absolute space unbothered by haecceitistic differences,\nthe possibility in question poses no challenge. Still others might\nretain realism about absolute space yet deny this apparent possibility\nis a genuine one. The most natural strategy here is to claim that\ncertain kinds of haecceitistic differences\u2014specifically, those\nthat involve merely a shift in spatial position\u2014do not\ncorrespond to genuinely distinct possibilities. Importantly, this\nthird strategy does not rule out haecceitistic differences per\nse, but requires at least a domain-specific anti-haecceitism,\naccording to which there are no haecceitistic differences regarding\nregions of absolute space.\n\nIn response to arguments that broach the question of haecceitism in a\nlimited domain, useful debate requires us to distinguish the scope of\ndifferent versions of haecceitism and the distinctive motivations of\ndomain-specific (anti-)haecceitisms. Naturally, one might accept\ncertain kinds of haecceitistic differences while rejecting others. For\nexample, while one might accept possibilities according to which two\ntwins swap qualitative roles, one might deny that you and Obama could\nswap their respective roles. In addition, even those who accept these\nhaecceitistic differences regarding humans can deny that you could\nhave swapped qualitative roles with your singleton set or the Milky\nWay galaxy. The question that arises for those unswayed by blanket\narguments against haecceitism is to determine which putative\nhaecceitistic differences between possibilities are to be admitted.\nCharacterizing this or that view as committed to haecceitism\nsimpliciter can therefore prove unhelpful without a\nspecification of the precise haecceitistic differences admitted.\n7. Connections to Haecceitism\n\nHaecceitism has consequences for a range of issues in metaphysics and\nthe philosophy of language. This section provides a brief overview of\nsome of the ways in which haecceitism proves most significant.\n7.1 Haecceitism & Quidditism\n\nQuidditism is the property-theoretic analogue of haecceitism.\n(Armstrong (1989: 59) seems to coin the term\n\u2018quidditism.\u2019) But, while distinctively haecceitistic\npossibilities involve individuals being \u201cswapped\u201d or\n\u201creplaced\u201d without any qualitative difference,\ndistinctively quidditistic possibilities involve properties swapping\nor replacing one another in the world\u2019s causal-nomic structure.\nIf, for example, there is a maximal possibility, otherwise\nindiscernible from actuality, where mass and charge\nswap their respective causal-nomic roles (e.g., where objects resist\nacceleration in virtue of their charge), this maximal possibility\nwould differ quidditistically from actuality. Similarly, if there is a\nmaximal possibility according to which all actual causal-nomic facts\nare the same except that some actually uninstantiated property,\nschmass, occupies the causal and nomic role of mass,\nthis maximal possibility would also differ quidditistically from\nactuality. (Typically, quidditism is taken as a thesis about\nfundamental or \u201csparse\u201d properties like mass and\ncharge rather than as a thesis about all properties\nwhatsoever.)\n\nLike haecceitism, quidditism\u2019s proper formulation is contentious\nand depends heavily upon background metaphysical assumptions. Some\nformulations of quidditism invoke either maximal possibilities or\npossible worlds, while modalist formulations of quidditism do without\neither resource. Additionally, there is a quidditistic analogue of\ncheap haecceitism, according to which a given possible world\nrepresents various maximal possibilities that differ only\nquidditistically. (On formulations of quidditism and property\ncounterpart theory, see Hawthorne (2002b) and Heller (2002,\n2005).)\n\nArguments for quidditism have notable parallels with arguments for\nhaecceitism. Some quidditists suggest that our pedestrian modal\njudgments support quidditism (see, e.g., Lewis (2009: 209), while\nother defenses of quidditism can appeal to the apparent conceivability\nof scenarios where properties swap their causal-nomic roles.\nAdditionally, Bird (2007: 74\u201376) considers but rejects a\nproperty-theoretic analogue of Chisholm\u2019s Paradox that, if\nsuccessful, establishes quidditism. A different line of argument,\nwhich has no direct analogue in the case of haecceitism, appeals to\ncombinatorial principles regarding the nature of modality. These\ncombinatorial principles hold that various permutations of fundamental\nproperties across, say, causal nomic roles, correspond to distinct\nmaximal possibilities, which, if genuine, would differ only\nquidditistically. (See Lewis (2009: 209) for the combinatorial\nargument and Locke (2010), Schaffer (2005: 10), and Wang\n(2016) for discussion.)\n\nArguments against quidditism also appeal to modal intuitions. Black\n(2000: 94) says, for example, that quidditistic differences are\n\u201cdistinctions which my intuitions tell me are distinctions\nwithout differences\u2026 My intuition is that to play the\nnomological role of some colour or flavour is to be that colour or\nflavour, at that the idea of two qualities swapping nomological roles\nis thus unintelligible.\u201d Other anti-quidditist arguments turn on\nits purported epistemological consequences. On this front, some\nanti-quidditists (as well as some quidditists) hold that quidditism\nentails that we are irremediably ignorant of the distribution of the\nworld\u2019s fundamental properties. (Lewis (2009) labels the\nresulting view, \u201cRamseyan Humility.\u201d On quidditism and\nhumility, see also Bird (2007: 79), Hawthorne (2002b), Locke (2009),\nSchaffer (2005), Shoemaker (1980), and Whittle (2006).) Additional\ncomplaints and concerns about quidditism are diverse in character.\nLocke (2012) discusses Ockhamist worries about the ontology of\nquidditism and, specifically, second-order quiddities. Whittle (2006)\nworries about the epiphenomenal intrinsic nature of properties, given\nquidditism\u2019s alleged modal consequences. Black (2000) offers a\ncardinality argument against quidditism, which holds its modal\ncommitments to demand the existence of proper class-many possible\nworlds. Hawthorne (2002b) considers whether quidditism might\nultimately require a kind of \u201chyperstructuralism\u201d,\naccording to which absolutely any property might swap roles with any\nother property including the relation of causal necessitation\nitself. The resulting bizarre possibilities\u2014e.g., where\nmass and causal necessitation swap roles\u2014would\ndeliver a reductio of quidditism should they prove\nunavoidable.\n\nAlthough haecceitism and quidditism are independent theses, since\nneither strictly entails the other, their evidential relationship is\nan interesting one. Given the parallels between the arguments for and\nagainst them, it is unclear whether haecceitists ought to be\nquidditists and vice versa or if the metaphysical\ndisanalogies between properties and individuals can justify endorsing\none but not the other. (On the analogies and disanalogies between\nhaecceitism and quidditism, see Schaffer (2005: 15\u201316).)\n7.2 Haecceitism & Personal Identity\n\nDebates about personal identity relate to haecceitism in diverse and\ncomplex ways. Perhaps most notably, some arguments for the\n\u201cSimple View\u201d of personal identity (alternatively, the\n\u201cFurther Fact view\u201d), according to which facts about the\nidentity of persons over time are irreducible and non-qualitative, are\nplausibly taken as arguments for haecceitism. (On anti-reductionism\nand the Simple View, see Parfit (1984: 210) and Olson (2012).) These\narguments exploit so-called \u201cfission cases\u201d, which involve\nan individual that apparently splits into distinct individuals but\nwithout principled grounds for identifying one rather than another of\nthe post-fission individuals with the pre-fission individual.\nAccording to some proponents of the Simple View, it seems possible\nthat that the pre-fission individual be identical to one of the\npost-fission individuals while, in other physically and\npsychologically indiscernible worlds, the pre-fission individual is\nidentical to an apparently different post-fission individual. If,\nhowever, these are each genuine possibilities, facts about the\nidentity of persons over time do not supervene upon any physical or\npsychological facts. And, since these are the qualitative facts\ntypically held to be relevant to personal identity over time, such\ncases suggest that facts about personal identity over time do not\nsupervene upon qualitative features. In this way, the Simple View\nlends support to the more general claim that non-qualitative facts\nabout the identity of persons do not supervene upon qualitative\nfacts.\n\nIn addition to its connection to the Simple View, a broader\nmethodological connection unites haecceitism and inquiries into\npersonal identity: a focus on the qualitative/non-qualitative\ndistinction. In debates about personal identity, appeal to exclusively\nqualitative properties and relations (e.g., having such-and-such\npsychological features) rather than non-qualitative properties\nand relations (e.g., having Bob\u2019s memories) is commonly\ntaken as a constraint on a genuinely reductive analysis of personal\nidentity over time. So, just as haecceitism requires clarifying the\nnature of this metaphysical distinction, criteria for distinguishing\nthe reductive and non-reductive approaches to personal identity also\nrely heavily on the idea that certain properties are uniquely tied to\nthe identity of individuals. On the connection between haecceitism,\nthe Simple View, and (anti-)reductionist approaches to personal\nidentity, see Ninan (2009).\n7.3 Haecceitism & Physicalism\n\nThe connection between haecceitism and physicalism is controversial.\nIf we understand physicalism as the unqualified thesis that physical\nproperties like mass and charge exhaustively fix all\nother properties, haecceitistic differences present a prima\nfacie challenge. For, if some worlds differ haecceitistically but\nare alike with respect to the distribution of physical properties,\nthen, contrary to physicalism, possible worlds or maximal\npossibilities can be physically indiscernible yet fail to be\nindiscernible simpliciter. Moreover, some follow Hofweber\n(2005) in taking the irreducibility of haecceities and other\nnon-qualitative properties to physical properties to constitute a\nchallenge to more sophisticated conceptions of physicalism. (See Daly\nand Liggins (2012) and Almotahari and Rochford (2012) on\nHofweber\u2019s argument. See Ninan (2009: 433) on haecceitism and\nits relation to physicalism.)\n\nA different assessment denies that haecceitism and physicalism are in\ntension with one another by taking the scope of physicalism to be\nrestricted to qualitative properties. So understood, haecceitism has\nno significance for the fate of physicalism, since haecceitistic\ndifferences are purely non-qualitative in character. For those who\ncharacterize physicalism as the thesis that worlds that are physical\nduplicates of one another are duplicates simpliciter, this\nresponse is especially plausible, since talk of\n\u201cduplication\u201d is typically restricted to qualitative\nproperties. (See Stoljar (2010: 136) on the options for formulating\nphysicalism.)\n\nGiven the complex interaction between haecceitism and physicalism, a\nnatural strategy for circumventing this issue simply sets aside the\nquestion of haecceitism in investigating the status of physicalism.\nFor example, in characterizing physicalism, Chalmers (1996: 367) says:\n\u201cI will always be considering worlds\n\u2018qualitatively\u2019, and abstracting away from question of\n\u2018haecceity.\u2019 That is, I will count two worlds that are\nqualitatively identical as identical and will not be concerned with\nquestions about whether individuals in those worlds might have\ndifferent \u2018identities.\u2019\u201d The merits of bracketing\nthe uncertain compatibility of haecceitism and physicalism are\nsignificant, but, for views that do hold them to be incompatible, no\nsuch strategy will ultimately prove plausible.\n7.4 Haecceitism & Spacetime\n\nThe Hole Argument against substantivalism purports to show that, given\nsome auxiliary assumptions, substantivalism illicitly requires the\ntruth of indeterminism. (See Norton\u2019s entry on the Hole\nArgument.) Defenders of the Hole Argument take this commitment to\nindeterminism to be a consequence of accepting certain models of\ngeneral relativity as genuinely distinct possibilities for\nsubstantival spacetime. The possible models in question are typically\nheld to differ only haecceitistically, so, for substantivalists,\nanti-haecceitism provides a route for rejecting the possibilities that\nare alleged to require indeterminism. For committed haecceitists who\nendorse substantivalism, some alternative strategy is required. One\navailable option is to revise the relevant conception of determinism\nby taking it as a thesis about qualitatively discernible possibilities\nrather than possibilities in general. On the resulting revision,\nindeterminism requires the availability of qualitatively discernible\npossibilities. As a consequence, admitting possibilities that differ\nonly haecceitistically would have no implications for the status of\ndeterminism. Careful attention to the status and scope of haecceitism\ntherefore proves crucial for assessing this argument against\nsubstantivalism.\n\nIn addition to Norton\u2019s entry on the Hole Argument, see Pooley\n(2006) for a defense of anti-haecceitism. See Dasgupta (2017) and\nRussell (2013b) on anti-haecceitism about spacetime, and Brighouse\n(1994, 1997) and Melia (2009) on haecceitism and determinism.\n7.5 Haecceitism & the Philosophy of Language\n\nHaecceitism informs several issues in the philosophy of language\nprimarily through its conventional connection to realism about\nhaecceities. Since haecceities uniquely correspond to individuals,\nrealists about haecceities have a distinctive metaphysical resource\nfor the development of semantic theories. In addition, for realists\nabout haecceities who believe that all properties exist necessarily,\nhaecceities of nonexistent individuals provide an especially natural\nmetaphysical surrogate when explaining the possibility of true and\nmeaningful claims about the individuals in question. So, for example,\nif one holds that singular terms like \u2018Obama\u2019 contribute\nthe haecceity being Obama to the singular proposition expressed by\nsentences that include \u2018Obama\u2019, one can make sense of the\ntruth and meaningfulness of claims regarding Obama in worlds in which\nObama does not exist. (On this strategy, see Plantinga (1978: 132).)\nThe general strategy of using haecceities as metaphysical surrogates\nfor individuals has surfaced in debates about the philosophy of time,\nwhere, e.g., Markosian (2004: 54\u201356), considers appropriating\nhaecceities of non-present individuals to address objections to\npresentism.\n\nSome appeals to haecceities in the philosophy of language are more\nlimited and nuanced\u2014e.g., Hawthorne and Manley (2012: 204)\nconsider the deployment of haecceities and other non-qualitative\nproperties in a semantics for demonstratives\u2014while other\napplications are more general in scope\u2014e.g., analyses of de\nre senses or individual concepts in terms of haecceities. (For\ndiscussion, see Chisholm (1976: 29).)\n",
