    "main_text": "Tradition\n10. Tradition\n\nArt seems to solve the riddle of the temporal core of truth (Adorno).\nA work that proves itself a \u201cclassic\u201d through the ages and\nremains constant in its effect remains binding, no matter how the\ninterpretations and the criteria of evaluation change in the course of\ntime. (Habermas quoted by Krajewski 2004, 20)\n\n\nWhat binds us to a tradition, according to Gadamer, is not a misplaced\nconservatism but the questions a canon or body of work asks of us.\nHowever, the question of tradition is one of the most controversial\nwithin Gadamer\u2019s philosophy. It arises because of the way\nGadamer establishes individual and collective learning on the\nacquisition of accrued experiences (Bildung) and practices,\nrather than upon any methodological norm. His argument exposes the\nEnlightenment prejudice against prejudice. The liberating and\nuniversalizing aspects of reason tend to marginalize and chastise both\nthe culturally different and the historically particular as divisive\nand irrational. Gadamer contends, however, that such an unqualified\nhypostasization of reason and its methods has the unfortunate\nconsequence of condemning as methodologically groundless the very\nvaluations that ordinary linguistic and experiential practices are\nbased on. Gadamer is not unsympathetic to Nietzsche, who rejects the\nclaim that humanity is shaped by external necessity. Our existence\nwithin the world and our place within it is, metaphysically speaking,\nutterly contingent. If there is no metaphysical necessity that governs\nhuman practices, why should we even ask for a methodological\ngrounding, when language has neither required nor functioned with such\na license? Like Wilhelm Dilthey before him, Gadamer insists that\nnothing justifies and gives meaning to life other than life itself.\nThis is not the invocation of nihilism, for life does not occur in a\nvacuum. Creatures such as humans, which have no pre-determined\nessence, only survive by both remembering what has worked well within\na practice and by constantly testing it against contemporary needs and\ncircumstances. There is a constant tension between acquired experience\nand the need to stabilize its lessons and the need to question and\nthereby destabilize the tried and the tested. All expressive practices\ndepend upon an inheritance of insight and valuation. They are\ndependent upon accrued learning and experience. Such observations\nagitate Gadamer\u2019s critics, who see in the unreflective\nacceptance of the given an irresponsibly conservative privileging of\nthe received, and a wilful blindness to possible repressive or\nexclusionary practices within inherited modes of operation. In\nresponse to such scepticism, it must be acknowledged that inherited\npractices can, logically speaking, have negative entailments. However,\na commitment to tradition, is neither a commitment to remaining the\nsame, nor is it indicative of a willful refusal to confront the\nnegative entailments within what is transmitted historically.\nTraditions which are incapable of changing risk becoming outmoded.\nTraditions are not founded upon core and fixed identities. As vibrant\nreligious and artistic traditions demonstrate, those which are in\nconstant debate over aim and direction often prove engaging and\ninfluential. Traditions capable of subjecting their self-understanding\nto critique constitute continuities of conflict. The importance of\nreceived understanding for Gadamer is not its historical provenance\nbut how it opens us towards and engages us with issues in a community\nof debate. The Cartesian project of subjecting all beliefs to\nsceptical examination until they can be methodologically affirmed is,\nin Gadamer\u2019s view, nihilistic. The project is implausible since\nthe range and depth of pre-understanding is so extensive as to be\nuntheorisable. To condemn pre-understanding as unjustifiable because\nit cannot be methodologically grounded is highly dangerous as it\ndevalues those very insights upon which our initial world-orientation\ndepends. It is not that these insights are instrinsically valuable but\nthat they are essential staging posts in the journeys of understanding\nthey enable. It is the continuous debate and dialogue over practice\nthat enables participants to move on, widen, and transform acquired\nexperience. Movement and development is intrinsic to the German word\nfor tradition: \u00dcberlieferung has the active connotation\nof both transmitting and handing something on. What a tradition\ntransmits from age to age are questions, problems, and issues. The\nimportance of canonic works is not that they are peerless exemplars of\nan idiom or style but rather that they raise issues and difficulties\nin an exemplary way. Traditions can check their self-understanding\nagainst their own historical projections. A commitment to tradition is\nnot a commitment to an academic antiquarianism. It is, essentially, a\ncommitment to a field of debate. Tradition is presented as a resource\nand a provocation for thinking and creativity: whereas sameness is the\ncurrency of a conservative conception of tradition, instability,\nquestions, and the challenge of otherness are the drivers of\nGadamer\u2019s more dialogical concept of tradition.\n\nIt has been argued against Gadamer that his revaluation of tradition\ndoes not really bring its content to a point of critical reflection.\nHe acknowledges that like any other temporal phenomenon, not all of\nits vistas can be adequately thematized or articulated. This does not\nmean, however, that tradition is beyond critical appraisal. Traditions\ncan, as Pannenberg argues, check their normative assumptions against\ntheir self-projections. Other critics suggest that Gadamer\u2019s\napproach to tradition and aesthetics is overtly Classical in its\npreoccupation with forms that maintain a continuity through time\nrather than radically alter themselves. It does not allow for those\nradical intrusions or revolutionary interjections which alter the\nperceptual paradigm of an age. The counter-objection is not only that\nthe charge overlooks Gadamer\u2019s embrace of Heidegger\u2019s\nquite radical phenomenological reworking of the Classical\ntradition\u00a0but also the fact that for one paradigm to replace\nanother, there must be a certain relation between them. One must\naddress an absence, fullfil an unseen possibility or a lack within the\nother. Cubism, for example, implies a visual orientation quite\ndifferent from realism, but both idioms belong to a common tradition\nin that they strive to show us something of the real. Without a degree\nof continuity with tradition, any radical emergence would have no\nbearing upon the received and thereby lack the ability to call into\nquestion received notions and understanding. It is, however, precisely\nthe challenge of the different and the other which is the driver of\nGadamer\u2019s dialogical conception of tradition. It is a conception\nwhich is in part modernistic: tradition is presented as being in\nconstant debate with itself. Its renewal demands change and\ntransformation. Furthermore, a virtue of this dialogical conception of\ntradition is that it is not culturally specific. Because its main\nfocus is on the subject-matters which different cultural practices\naddress, it offers a model of cognitive engagement that can operate\nbetween distinct traditions rather than in just any one.\n",
