Rousseau\u2019s own view of most philosophy and\nphilosophers was firmly negative, seeing them as post-hoc\nrationalizers of self-interest, as apologists for various forms of\ntyranny, and as playing a role in the alienation of the modern\nindividual from humanity\u2019s natural impulse to compassion. The\nconcern that dominates Rousseau\u2019s work is to find a way of\npreserving human freedom in a world where people are increasingly\ndependent on one another to satisfy their needs. This concern has two\ndimensions: material and psychological, of which the latter has\ngreater importance. In the modern world, human beings get their very\nsense of their identity and value from the opinion of others, which\nRousseau sees as corrosive of freedom and destructive of individual\nauthenticity. In his mature work, he principally explores two routes\nto achieving and protecting freedom: the first is a political one\naimed at constructing institutions that permit and foster the\nco-existence of free and equal citizens in a community where they\nthemselves are sovereign; the second is a project for child\ndevelopment and education that nurtures autonomy and avoids the\ngenesis of the most destructive forms of self-interest. However,\nthough Rousseau believes the co-existence of human beings in relations\nof equality and freedom is possible, he is consistently and\noverwhelmingly pessimistic that humanity will escape from a dystopia\nof alienation, oppression, and unfreedom. In addition to his\ncontributions to philosophy, Rousseau was active as a composer and a\nmusic theorist, as the pioneer of modern autobiography, as a novelist,\nand as a botanist. Rousseau\u2019s appreciation of the wonders of\nnature and his stress on the importance of feeling and emotion made\nhim an important influence on and anticipator of the romantic\nmovement. To a very large extent, the interests and concerns that mark\nhis philosophical work also inform these other activities, and\nRousseau\u2019s contributions in ostensibly non-philosophical fields\noften serve to illuminate his philosophical commitments and\narguments.\n", "toc": [{"#Life": "1.

Life\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau was born in the independent Calvinist city-state\nof Geneva in 1712, the son of Isaac Rousseau, a watchmaker, and\nSuzanne Bernard. Rousseau\u2019s mother died nine days after his\nbirth, so Rousseau was raised and educated by his father until the age\nof ten. Isaac Rousseau was one of the small minority of Geneva\u2019s\nresidents who enjoyed the rank of citizen of Geneva, and was therefore\na member of the city\u2019s nominally sovereign assembly.\nJean-Jacques was to inherit this status. According to his own\nsubsequent accounts, the haphazard education that he received from his\nfather included both the inculcation of republican patriotism and the\nreading of historians of ancient republicanism, such as Plutarch.\nAfter his father fled this city to avoid arrest, Jean-Jacques was put\nin the care of a pastor at nearby Bossey and subsequently apprenticed\nto an engraver. Rousseau left Geneva at the age of sixteen and came\nunder the influence of a Roman Catholic convert noblewoman,\nFran\u00e7oise-Louise de la Tour, Baronne de Warens. Mme de Warens\narranged for Rousseau to travel to Turin, where he converted to Roman\nCatholicism in April 1728. He spent some time working as a domestic\nservant in a noble household in Turin, and during this time a shameful\nepisode occurred in which he falsely accused a fellow servant of the\ntheft of a ribbon. This act marked him deeply and he returns to it in\nhis autobiographical works.\n\nRousseau then spent a brief period training to become a Catholic\npriest before embarking on another brief career as an itinerant\nmusician, music copyist and teacher. In 1731 he returned to Mme de\nWarens at Chamb\u00e9ry and later briefly became her lover and then\nher household manager. He remained with Mme de Warens through the rest\nof the 1730s, moving to Lyon in 1740 to take up a position as a tutor.\nThis appointment brought him within the orbit of both Condillac and\nd\u2019Alembert and was his first contact with major figures of the\nFrench Enlightenment. In 1742 he travelled to Paris, having devised a\nplan for a new numerically-based system of musical notation which he\npresented to the Academy of Sciences. The system was rejected by the\nAcademy, but in this period Rousseau met Denis Diderot. A brief spell\nas secretary to the French Ambassador in Venice followed before\nRousseau moved to Paris on a more permanent basis from 1744, where he\ncontinued to work mainly on music and began to write contributions to\nthe Encyclop\u00e9die of Diderot and d\u2019Alembert.\n\nIn 1745 Rousseau met Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Levasseur, a barely\nliterate laundry-maid who became his lover and, later, his wife.\nAccording to Rousseau\u2019s own account, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se bore\nhim five children, all of whom were deposited at the foundling\nhospital shortly after birth, an almost certain sentence of death in\neighteenth-century France. Rousseau\u2019s abandonment of his\nchildren was later to be used against him by Voltaire.\n\nIn 1749, while walking to Vincennes to visit the briefly-imprisoned\nDiderot and idly reading a newspaper, Rousseau came across the\nannouncement of an essay competition organized by the Academy of\nDijon. The Academy sought submissions on the theme of whether the\ndevelopment of the arts and sciences had improved or corrupted public\nmorals. Rousseau later claimed that he then and there experienced an\nepiphany which included the thought, central to his world view, that\nhumankind is good by nature but is corrupted by society. He entered\nhis Discourse on the Sciences and Arts (conventionally known\nas the First Discourse) for the competition and won first\nprize with his contrarian thesis that social development, including of\nthe arts and sciences, is corrosive of both civic virtue and\nindividual moral character. The Discourse was published in\n1751 and is mainly important because Rousseau used it to introduce\nthemes that he developed further in later work, especially the natural\nvirtue of the ordinary person and the moral corruption fostered by the\nurge to distinction and excellence. The First Discourse made\nRousseau famous and provoked a series of responses to which he in turn\nreplied.\n\nMusic remained Rousseau\u2019s primary interest in this period, and\nthe years 1752 and 1753 saw his most important contributions to the\nfield. The first of these was his opera Le Devin du Village\n(The Village Soothsayer), which was an immediate success (and\nstayed in the repertoire for a century). The second was his\nparticipation in a controversy known as the \u201cquerelle des\nbouffons\u201d, that followed the performance in Paris of\nPergolesi\u2019s La Serva Padrona by a visiting Italian\ncompany and which pitted the partisans of Italian music against those\nof the French style. Rousseau, who had already developed a taste for\nItalian music during his stay in Venice, joined the dispute through\nhis Letter on French Music and the controversy also informed\nhis (unpublished) Essay on the Origin of Languages.\nRousseau\u2019s emphasis on the importance of melody and the\ncommunication of emotion as central to the function of music was in\nopposition to the views of Rameau, who stressed harmony and the\nrelationships between music, mathematics, and physics. Rousseau went\nso far as to declare the French language inherently unmusical, a view\napparently contradicted by his own practice in Le Devin.\n\nRousseau\u2019s conversion to Catholicism had rendered him ineligible\nfor his hereditary status as a citizen of Geneva. In 1754 he regained\nthis citizenship by reconverting to Calvinism. In the following year\nhe published his Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of\nInequality among Men (often referred to simply as the\nDiscourse on Inequality or as the Second Discourse).\nOnce again this was in response to an essay competition from the\nAcademy of Dijon. Though he did not win the Academy\u2019s prize a\nsecond time, the Discourse on Inequality is a far more\naccomplished work, and in it Rousseau begins to develop his theories\nof human social development and moral psychology. With the\nDiscourse on Inequality, the distance between Rousseau and\nthe Encyclop\u00e9diste mainstream of the French\nEnlightenment thought became clear. This rift was cemented with his\n1758 publication of the Letter to d\u2019Alembert on the\nTheater, in which he denounced the idea that his native city\nwould benefit from the construction of a theater. In Rousseau\u2019s\nview theater, far from improving the population, tends to weaken their\nattachment to the life of the political community.\n\nThe years following the publication of the Discourse on\nInequality were the most productive and important of\nRousseau\u2019s career. He withdrew from Paris and, under the\npatronage of, first Mme d\u2019Epinay and then the Duke and Duchess\nof Luxembourg, worked on a novel, Julie, ou La Nouvelle\nH\u00e9lo\u00efse, and then on Emile and The\nSocial Contract. Julie appeared in 1761 and was an\nimmediate success. The novel is centred on a love triangle between\nJulie, her tutor Saint Preux and her husband Wolmar. The work is cast\nin epistolary form, and is an important supplementary source for the\ninterpretation of Rousseau\u2019s social philosophy, containing, as\nit does, such elements as a vision of rural community and the presence\nof a manipulative genius who achieves the appearance of natural\nharmony through cunning artifice, and who thus anticipates both the\ntutor in Emile and the legislator of The Social\nContract. Both works appeared in 1762, marking the high point of\nRousseau\u2019s intellectual achievement.\n\nUnfortunately for Rousseau, the publication of these works also led to\npersonal catastrophe. Emile was condemned in Paris and both\nEmile and The Social Contract were condemned in\nGeneva on grounds of their religious heterodoxy, a condemnation that\nRousseau responded to in his Letters from the Mountains\nPartly in response to the hostile attitude of the Genevan authorities,\nRousseau renounced his citizenship in May 1763. He was forced to flee\nto escape arrest, seeking refuge first in Switzerland and then\ntravelling to England at the invitation of David Hume in January\n1766.\n\nRousseau\u2019s stay in England was marked by his increasing mental\ninstability and he became wrongly convinced that Hume was at the\ncenter of a plot against him. He spent fourteen months in\nStaffordshire where he worked on his autobiographical\nConfessions, which also contain evidence of his paranoia in\nits treatment of figures like Diderot and the German author Friedrich\nMelchior, Baron von Grimm. He returned to France in 1767 and then\nspent much of the rest of his life working on autobiographical texts,\ncompleting the Confessions but also composing the\nDialogues: Rousseau Judge of Jean-Jacques and The\nReveries of the Solitary Walker. He also completed his\nConsiderations on the Government of Poland in this period. In\nlater life he further developed his interest in botany (where his work\nproved influential in England via his letters on the subject to the\nDuchess of Portland) and in music, as he met and corresponded with the\noperatic composer Christoph Gluck. Rousseau died in 1778. In 1794 the\nFrench revolutionaries transferred his remains to the Panth\u00e9on\nin Paris.\n2. Conjectural history and moral psychology\n\nRousseau repeatedly claims that a single idea is at the centre of his\nworld view, namely, that human beings are good by nature but are\nrendered corrupt by society (see Melzer 1990; Cohen 2010, chapter 4).\nUnfortunately, despite the alleged centrality of this claim, it is\ndifficult to give it a clear and plausible interpretation. One obvious\nproblem is present from the start: since society, the supposed agent\nof corruption, is composed entirely of naturally good human beings,\nhow can evil ever get a foothold? It is also hard to see what\n\u201cnatural goodness\u201d might be. In various places Rousseau\nclearly states that morality is not a natural feature of human life,\nso whatever sense it is that human beings are good by nature, it is\nnot the moral one that the casual reader would naturally assume. In\norder, therefore, to address this puzzling central claim, it is best\nto look first at the details of Rousseau\u2019s moral psychology,\nespecially as developed in the Discourse on Inequality and in\nEmile.\n\nRousseau attributes to all creatures an instinctual drive towards\nself-preservation. Human beings therefore have such a drive, which he\nterms amour de soi (self love). Amour de soi directs\nus first to attend to our most basic biological needs for things like\nfood, shelter and warmth. Since, for Rousseau, humans, like other\ncreatures, are part of the design of a benevolent creator, they are\nindividually well-equipped with the means to satisfy their natural\nneeds. Alongside this basic drive for self-preservation, Rousseau\nposits another passion which he terms piti\u00e9\n(compassion). Piti\u00e9 directs us to attend to and\nrelieve the suffering of others (including animals) where we can do so\nwithout endangering our own self-preservation. In some of his\nwritings, such as the Discourse on Inequality,\npiti\u00e9 is an original drive that sits alongside\namour de soi, whereas in others, such as Emile and\nthe Essay on the Origin of Languages, it is a development of\namour de soi considered as the origin of all passions.\n\nIn the Discourse on Inequality Rousseau imagines a\nmulti-stage evolution of humanity from the most primitive condition to\nsomething like a modern complex society. Rousseau denies that this is\na reconstruction of history as it actually was, and Frederick\nNeuhouser (2014) has argued that the evolutionary story is merely a\nphilosophical device designed to separate the natural and the\nartificial elements of our psychology (for a contrasting view see\nKelly 2006). At each step of this imagined evolution human beings\nchange their material and psychological relations to one another and,\ncorrespondingly, their conception of themselves, or what Rousseau\ncalls the \u201csentiment of their existence.\u201d According to\nthis narrative, humans live almost entirely solitary lives in the\noriginal state of the human race, since they do not need one another\nto satisfy their material needs. The human race barely subsists in\nthis condition, chance meetings between proto-humans are the occasions\nfor copulation and reproduction, child-care is minimal and brief in\nduration. If humans are naturally good at this stage of human\nevolution, their goodness is merely a negative and amounts to the\nabsence of evil. In this story, human beings are distinguished from\nthe other creatures with which they share the primeval world only by\ntwo characteristics: freedom, and perfectibility. Freedom, in this\ncontext, is simply the ability not to be governed solely by appetite;\nperfectibility is the capacity to learn and thereby to find new and\nbetter means to satisfy needs. Together, these characteristics give\nhumans the potential to achieve self-consciousness, rationality, and\nmorality. Nevertheless, it will turn out that such characteristics are\nmore likely to condemn them to a social world of deception,\ndissimulation, dependence, oppression, and domination.\n\nAs human populations grow, simple but unstable forms of co-operation\nevolve around activities like hunting. According to Rousseau, the most\nimportant transitional moment in human history occurs at a stage of\nsociety marked by small settled communities. At this point a change,\nor rather a split, takes place in the natural drive humans have to\ncare for themselves: competition among humans to attract sexual\npartners leads them to consider their own attractiveness to others and\nhow that attractiveness compares to that of potential rivals. In\nEmile, where Rousseau is concerned with the psychological\ndevelopment of an individual in a modern society, he also associates\nthis new psychological feature with sexual competition and the moment,\npuberty, when the male adolescent starts to think of himself as a\nsexual being with rivals for the favours of girls and women.\n\nRousseau\u2019s term for this new type of self-interested drive,\nconcerned with comparative success or failure as a social being, is\namour propre (love of self, often rendered as pride or vanity\nin English translations). Amour propre make the need to be\nrecognized by others as having value and to be treated with respect\ncentral to the felt interests of each human being . The presentation\nof amour propre in the Discourse on\nInequality\u2014and especially in his note XV to that\nwork\u2014often suggests that Rousseau sees it as a wholly negative\npassion and the source of all evil. Interpretations of amour\npropre centered on the Discourse on Inequality (which,\nhistorically, are the most common ones (for example Charvet 1974)),\noften focus on the fact that the need for recognition always has a\ncomparative aspect, so that individuals are not content merely that\nothers acknowledge their value, but also seek to be esteemed as\nsuperior to them. This aspect of our nature then creates conflict as\npeople try to exact this recognition from others or react with anger\nand resentment when it is denied to them. More recent readings of both\nthe Discourse on Inequality, and especially of\nEmile, have indicated that a more balanced view is possible\n(Dent 1988, Neuhouser 2008, but see McLendon 2019 for pushback).\nAccording to these interpretations, amour propre is both the\ncause of humanity\u2019s fall as well as the promise of its\nredemption because of the way in which it develops humans\u2019\nrational capacities and their sense of themselves as social creatures\namong others. Although Rousseau held that the overwhelming tendency,\nsocially and historically, is for amour propre to take on\ntoxic and self-defeating (\u2018inflamed\u2019) forms, he also held\nthat there are, at least in principle, ways of organizing social life\nand individual education that allow it to take on a benign character.\nThis project of containing and harnessing amour propre finds\nexpression in both The Social Contract and Emile. In\nsome works, such as the Second Discourse, Rousseau presents\namour propre as a passion that is quite distinct from\namour de soi. In others, including Emile, he\npresents it as a form that amour de soi takes in a social\nenvironment. The latter is consistent with his view in Emile\nthat all the passions are outgrowths or developments of\namour de soi.\n\nAlthough amour propre has its origins in sexual competition\nand comparison within small societies, it does not achieve its full\ntoxicity until it is combined with a growth in material\ninterdependence among human beings. In the Discourse on\nInequality, Rousseau traces the growth of agriculture and\nmetallurgy and the first establishment of private property, together\nwith the emergence of inequality between those who own land and those\nwho do not. In an unequal society, human beings who need both the\nsocial good of recognition and such material goods as food, warmth,\netc. become enmeshed in social relations that are inimical both to\ntheir freedom and to their sense of self worth. Subordinates need\nsuperiors in order to have access to the means of life; superiors need\nsubordinates to work for them and also to give them the recognition\nthey crave. In such a structure there is a clear incentive for people\nto misrepresent their true beliefs and desires in order to attain\ntheir ends. Thus, even those who receive the apparent love and\nadulation of their inferiors cannot thereby find satisfaction for\ntheir amour propre. This trope of misrepresentation and\nfrustration receives its clearest treatment in Rousseau\u2019s\naccount of the figure of the European minister, towards the end of the\nDiscourse on Inequality, a figure whose need to flatter\nothers in order to secure his own wants leads to his alienation from\nhis own self.\n2.1 Morality\n\nAmour de soi, amour propre and piti\u00e9\nare not the full complement of passions in Rousseau\u2019s thinking.\nOnce people have achieved consciousness of themselves as social\nbeings, morality also becomes possible and this relies on the further\nfaculty of conscience. The fullest accounts of Rousseau\u2019s\nconception of morality are found in the Lettres Morales and\nin sections of the Confession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar,\na part of Emile. In the most primitive forms of human\nexistence, before the emergence of amour propre,\npiti\u00e9 balances or restrains self-interest. It is, to\nthat extent, akin to a moral sentiment such as Humean sympathy. But as\nsomething that is merely instinctual it lacks, for Rousseau, a\ngenuinely moral quality. Genuine morality, on the other hand, consists\nin the application of reason to human affairs and conduct. This\nrequires the mental faculty that is the source of genuinely moral\nmotivation, namely conscience. Conscience impels us to the\nlove of justice and morality in a quasi-aesthetic manner. As the\nappreciation of justice and the desire to act to further it,\nconscience is based in a sentiment of love for the well-orderedness of\na benign God\u2019s plan for the world. However, in a world dominated\nby inflamed amour propre, the normal pattern is not for a\nmorality of reason to supplement or supplant our natural proto-moral\nsympathies. Instead, the usual course of events in civil society is\nfor reason and sympathy to be displaced while humans\u2019 enhanced\ncapacity for reasoning is put at the service, not of morality, but of\nthe impulse to dominate, oppress and exploit. (For recent discussion\nof Rousseau on conscience and reason, see Neidleman, 2017, ch. 7.)\n\nA theme of both the Discourse on Inequality and the\nLetter to d\u2019Alembert is the way in which human beings\ncan deceive themselves about their own moral qualities. So, for\nexample, theatre audiences derive enjoyment from the eliciting of\ntheir natural compassion by a tragic scene on the stage; then,\nconvinced of their natural goodness, they are freed to act viciously\noutside the theater. Philosophy, too, can serve as a resource for\nself-deception. It can give people reasons to ignore the promptings of\npiti\u00e9 or, as in Rousseau\u2019s essay Principles\nof the Right of War, it can underpin legal codes (such as the law\nof war and peace) that the powerful may use to license oppressive\nviolence whilst deadening their natural feelings of compassion.\n3. Political Philosophy\n\nRousseau\u2019s contributions to political philosophy are scattered\namong various works, most notable of which are the Discourse on\nInequality, the Discourse on Political Economy, The\nSocial Contract, and Considerations on the Government of\nPoland. However, many of his other works, both major and minor,\ncontain passages that amplify or illuminate the political ideas in\nthose works. His central doctrine in politics is that a state can be\nlegitimate only if it is guided by the \u201cgeneral will\u201d of\nits members. This idea finds its most detailed treatment in The\nSocial Contract.\n\nIn The Social Contract, Rousseau sets out to answer what he\ntakes to be the fundamental question of politics, the reconciliation\nof the freedom of the individual with the authority of the state. This\nreconciliation is necessary because human society has evolved to a\npoint where individuals can no longer supply their needs through their\nown unaided efforts, but rather must depend on the co-operation of\nothers. The process whereby human needs expand and interdependence\ndeepens is set out in the Discourse on Inequality. In that\nwork, the a decisive moment of Rousseau\u2019s conjectural history\ninvolves the emergence of endemic conflict among the\nnow-interdependent individuals and the argument that the Hobbesian\ninsecurity of this condition would lead all to consent to the\nestablishment of state authority and law. This establishment amounts\nto the reinforcement of unequal and exploitative social relations that\nare now backed by law and state power. In an echo of Locke and an\nanticipation of Marx, Rousseau argues that this state would, in\neffect, be a class state, guided by the common interest of the rich\nand propertied and imposing unfreedom and subordination on the poor\nand weak. The propertyless consent to such an establishment because\ntheir immediate fear of a Hobbesian state of war leads them to fail to\nattend to the ways in which the new state will systematically\ndisadvantage them.\n\nThe Social Contract aims to set out an alternative to this\ndystopia, one in which, claims Rousseau, each person will enjoy the\nprotection of the common force whilst remaining as free as they were\nin the state of nature. The key to this reconciliation is the idea of\nthe general will: that is, the collective will of the citizen body\ntaken as a whole. The general will is the source of law and is willed\nby each and every citizen. In obeying the law each citizen is thus\nsubject to his or her own will, and consequently, according to\nRousseau, remains free.\n3.1 The idea of the general will\n\nRousseau\u2019s account of the general will is marked by unclarities\nand ambiguities that have attracted the interest of commentators since\nits first publication. The principal tension is between a democratic\nconception, where the general will is simply what the citizens of the\nstate have decided together in their sovereign assembly, and an\nalternative interpretation where the general will is the transcendent\nincarnation of the citizens\u2019 common interest that exists in\nabstraction from what any of them actually wants (Bertram 2012). To\nthese can be added a general will as the will of individual citizens\ntowards the common good (Canon 2022). All of these interpretations\nfind some support in Rousseau\u2019s texts, and all have been\ninfluential. Contemporary epistemic conceptions of democracy often\nmake reference to Rousseau\u2019s discussion in Book 2 chapter 3 of\nof The Social Contract. These accounts typically take\nCondorcet\u2019s jury theorem as a starting point, where democratic\nprocedures are conceived of as a method for discovering the truth\nabout the public interest; they then interpret the general will as a\ndeliberative means of seeking outcomes that satisfy the preferences of\nindividuals and render the authority of the state legitimate (see for\nexample, Grofman and Feld 1988). The tension between the\n\u201cdemocratic\u201d and the \u201ctranscendental\u201d\nconceptions can be reduced if we take Rousseau to be arguing for the\nview that, under the right conditions and subject to the right\nprocedures, citizen legislators will be led to converge on laws that\ncorrespond to their common interest; however, where those conditions\nand procedures are absent, the state necessarily lacks legitimacy. On\nsuch a reading, Rousseau may be committed to something like an a\nposteriori philosophical anarchism. Such a view holds that it is\npossible, in principle, for a state to exercise legitimate authority\nover its citizens, but all actual states\u2014and indeed all states\nthat we are likely to see in the modern era\u2014will fail to meet\nthe conditions for legitimacy.\n\nRousseau argues that in order for the general will to be truly general\nit must come from all and apply to all. This thought has both\nsubstantive and formal aspects. Formally, Rousseau argues that the law\nmust be general in application and universal in scope. The law cannot\nname particular individuals and it must apply to everyone within the\nstate. Rousseau believes that this condition will lead citizens,\nthough guided by a consideration of what is in their own private\ninterest, to favor laws that both secure the common interest\nimpartially and that are not burdensome and intrusive. For this to be\ntrue, however, it has to be the case that the situation of citizens is\nsubstantially similar to one another. In a state where citizens enjoy\na wide diversity of lifestyles and occupations, or where there is a\ngreat deal of cultural diversity, or where there is a high degree of\neconomic inequality, it will not generally be the case that the impact\nof the laws will be the same for everyone. In such cases it will often\nnot be true that a citizen can occupy the standpoint of the general\nwill merely by imagining the impact of general and universal laws on\nhis or her own case.\n3.2 The emergence of the general will: procedure, virtue and the legislator\n\nIn The Social Contract Rousseau envisages three different\ntypes or levels of will as being in play. First, individuals all have\nprivate wills corresponding to their own selfish interests as natural\nindividuals; second, each individual, insofar as he identifies with\nthe collective as a whole and assumes the identity of citizen, wills\nthe general will of that collective as his or her own, setting aside\nselfish interest in favor of a set of laws that allow all to coexist\nunder conditions of equal freedom; third, and very problematically, a\nperson can identify with the corporate will of a subset of the\npopulace as a whole. The general will is therefore both a property of\nthe collective and a result of its deliberations, and a property of\nthe individual insofar as the individual identifies as a member of the\ncollective. In a well-ordered society, there is no tension between\nprivate and general will, as individuals accept that both justice and\ntheir individual self-interest require their submission to a law which\nsafeguards their freedom by protecting them from the private violence\nand personal domination that would otherwise hold sway. In practice,\nhowever, Rousseau believes that many societies will fail to have this\nwell-ordered character. One way in which they can fail is if private\nindividuals are insufficiently enlightened or virtuous and therefore\nrefuse to accept the restrictions on their own conduct which the\ncollective interest requires. Another mode of political failure arises\nwhere the political community is differentiated into factions (perhaps\nbased on a class division between rich and poor) and where one faction\ncan impose its collective will on the state as a whole.\n\nThe Social Contract harbors a further tension between two\naccounts of how the general will emerges and its relation to the\nprivate wills of citizens. Sometimes Rousseau favors a procedural\nstory according to which the individual contemplation of self interest\n(subject to the constraints of generality and universality and under\npropitious sociological background conditions such as rough equality\nand cultural similarity) will result in the emergence of the general\nwill from the assembly of citizens (see Sreenivasan 2000). In this\naccount of the emergence of the general will, there seems to be no\nspecial need for citizens to have any specifically moral qualities:\nthe constraints on their choice should be enough. However, Rousseau\nalso clearly believes that the mere contemplation of self interest\nwould be inadequate to generate a general will. This may partly\nconcern issues of compliance, since selfish citizens who can will the\ngeneral will might still not be moved to obey it. But Rousseau also\nseems to believe that citizen virtue is a necessary condition for the\nemergence of the general will in the first place. This presents him\nwith a problem for which his figure of the legislator is one supposed\nsolution. As a believer in the plasticity of human nature, Rousseau\nholds that good laws make for good citizens. However, he also believes\nboth that good laws can only be willed by good citizens and that, in\norder to be legitimate, they must be agreed upon by the assembly. This\nputs him in some difficulty, as it is unlikely that the citizens who\ncome together to form a new state will have the moral qualities\nrequired to will good laws, as those citizens will have been\npsychologically shaped by unjust institutions. The legislator\ntherefore has the function of inspiring a sense of collective identity\nin the new citizens that allows them to identify with the whole and be\nmoved to support legislation that will eventually transform them and\ntheir children into good citizens. In this story, however, the new\ncitizens at first lack the capacity to discern the good reasons that\nsupport the new laws and the lawgiver has to persuade them by\nnon-rational means to legislate in their own best interests.\n\nThe figure of the legislator is a puzzle. Like the tutor in\nEmile, the legislator has the role of manipulating the\ndesires of his charges, giving them the illusion of free choice\nwithout its substance. Little wonder then that many critics have seen\nthese characters in a somewhat sinister light. In both cases there is\na mystery concerning where the educator figure comes from and how he\ncould have acquired the knowledge and virtue necessary to perform his\nrole. This, in turn, raises a problem of regress. If the legislator\nwas formed by a just society, then who performed the\nlegislator\u2019s role for that society, and how was that legislator\nformed? How did the tutor acquire his education if not from a tutor\nwho, in turn, was educated according to Rousseau\u2019s program by an\nearlier tutor? At least in the case of the legislator, Rousseau might\npoint to some actual historical examples such as the Spartan,\nLycurgus, to argue that the idea is not entirely divorced from\nreality, but this seems a weak straw to clutch at.\n3.3 Rousseau\u2019s claim to reconcile freedom and authority\n\nWhat then of Rousseau\u2019s key claim that freedom and authority can\nbe reconciled in his ideal republic through obedience to the general\nwill? The opening words of The Social Contract themselves\nrefer to freedom, with the famous saying that \u201cMan is born free,\nbut is everywhere in chains\u201d. This ringing declaration, however,\nis almost immediately followed by a note of paradox, as Rousseau\ndeclares that he can make this subjection \u201cin chains\u201d\nlegitimate. The thought that Rousseau\u2019s commitment to freedom\nmight not be all that it first appears is strengthened by other\npassages in the book, most notably his notorious declaration in Book 1\nchapter 7 of The Social Contract that those subject to the\ngeneral will are \u201cforced to be free.\u201d\n\nThe value of freedom or liberty is at the center of Rousseau\u2019s\nconcerns throughout his work , though he uses the term in various\ndifferent ways (Simpson 2006). He regards the capacity for choice, and\ntherefore the ability to act against instinct and inclination, as one\nof the features that distinguishes humans from animals species and\nmakes truly moral action possible. In the Discourse on\nInequality, for example, he characterizes animals in essentially\nCartesian terms, as mechanisms programmed to a fixed pattern of\nbehavior, in contrast to humans, who are not tied to any particular\nmode of life and can reject the promptings of instinct. This makes\npossible both the development of the human species and also its fall\nfrom grace, since individuals can ignore benign impulses (such as\npiti\u00e9) if they wish to. The freedom to act contrary to\nthe \u201cmechanism of the senses\u201d, and the power of willing\nand choosing is, for Rousseau, something entirely outside the laws of\nthe physical world and is therefore not subject to scientific\nexplanation. Rousseau also takes this freedom to choose to act as the\nbasis of all distinctively moral action. In The Social\nContract the connection between freedom of choice and morality is\ncentral to his argument against despotic government, where he writes\nthat the renunciation of freedom is contrary to human nature and that\nto renounce freedom in favour of another person\u2019s authority is\nto \u201cdeprive one\u2019s actions of all morality\u201d (SC\n1.4).\n\nIn Book I chapter 8 of the The Social Contract, Rousseau\ntries to illuminate his claim that the formation of the legitimate\nstate involves no net loss of freedom, but in fact, he makes a\nslightly different claim. The new claim involves the idea of an\nexchange of one type of freedom (natural freedom) for another type\n(civil freedom). Natural freedom involves an unlimited right to all\nthings, an idea that is reminiscent of Hobbes\u2019s \u201cright of\nnature\u201d in Leviathan. Since all human beings enjoy this\nliberty right to all things, it is clear that in a world occupied by\nmany interdependent humans, the practical value of that liberty may be\nalmost nonexistent. This is because any individual\u2019s capacity to\nget what they wants will be limited by their physical power and the\ncompeting physical power of others. Further, inevitable conflict over\nscarce resources will pit individuals against each other, so that\nunhindered exercise of natural freedom will result in violence and\nuncertainty. The formation of the state, and the promulgation of laws\nwilled by the general will, transforms this condition. With sovereign\npower in place, individuals are guaranteed a sphere of equal freedom\nunder the law, with protection for their own persons and security for\ntheir property. Provided that the law bearing equally on everyone is\nnot meddlesome or intrusive (and Rousseau believes it will not be,\nsince no individual has a motive to legislate burdensome laws) there\nwill be a net increase in freedom compared to the pre-political\nstate.\n\nRousseau makes a further claim in the same chapter of The Social\nContract, namely that in conditions of civil society the citizen\nachieves \u201cmoral freedom,\u201d by which he means obedience to a\nlaw that one has prescribed to oneself (for discussion see especially\nNeuhouser 1993). Although this latter claim is presented almost as an\nafterthought, it is the form of freedom most directly responsive to\nthe challenge Rousseau had set for himself two chapters earlier, which\ninvolved finding \u201ca form of association\u201d in which each\ncitizen would \u201cobey only himself.\u201d Naturally, this raises\nthe question of whether the citizen does in fact obey only himself\nwhen he obeys the general will. On the face of it, this claim looks\ndifficult to reconcile with the fact of majorities and minorities\nwithin a democratic state, since those citizens who find themselves\noutvoted would seem to be constrained by a decision with which they\ndisagree. Rousseau\u2019s solution to this puzzle is found much\nlater, in Book 4 chapter 3 of The Social Contract, where he\nargues that those who obey laws they did not vote for remain bound by\na will that is their own, since the democratic process has enabled\nthem to discover the content of a general will in which they share.\nMany commentators have found this argument unconvincing.\n\nRousseau\u2019s invocation of three types of freedom (natural, civil,\nand moral) in the text of The Social Contract can appear\nconfusing. The picture is further complicated by the fact that he also\nrelies on a fourth conception of freedom, related to civil freedom but\ndistinct from it, which he nowhere names explicitly. This is\n\u201crepublican freedom\u201d and consists, not in my being subject\nto my own will, but rather in the fact that the law protects me from\nbeing subject to the will of any other particular person in the manner\nthat a slave or a serf is. To find Rousseau\u2019s explicit\nendorsement of this idea, we have to look not to The Social\nContract, but rather to some of his unpublished notes and to his\nLetters from the Mountains. Yet the concept is clearly\nimplicit in the notorious \u201cforced to be free\u201d passage in\nBook 1 chapter 7, since he there explains that when each citizen is\nconstrained to obey the general will, he is thereby provided with a\nguarantee against \u201call personal dependence\u201d.\n3.4 Representation and government\n\nOne feature of Rousseau\u2019s political philosophy that has proved\nleast persuasive to later thinkers is his doctrine of sovereignty and\nrepresentation, with his apparent rejection of \u201crepresentative\ngovernment\u201d. At the center of Rousseau\u2019s view in The\nSocial Contract is his rejection of the Hobbesian idea that a\npeople\u2019s legislative will can be vested in some group or\nindividual that then acts with their authority but rules over them.\nInstead, he argues that to hand over one\u2019s general right of\nruling oneself to another person or body is a form a slavery, and that\nto recognize such an authority would amount to an abdication of moral\nagency. This hostility to the representation of sovereignty also\nextends to the election of representatives to sovereign assemblies,\neven where those representatives are subject to periodic re-election.\nEven in that case, the assembly would be legislating on a range of\ntopics on which citizens have not deliberated. Laws passed by such\nassemblies would therefore bind citizens in terms that they have not\nthemselves agreed upon. Not only does the representation of\nsovereignty constitute, for Rousseau, a surrender of moral agency, the\nwidespread desire to be represented in the business of self-rule is a\nsymptom of moral decline and the loss of virtue.\n\nThe practical difficulties of direct self-rule by the entire citizen\nbody are obvious. Such arrangements are potentially onerous and must\nseverely limit the size of legitimate states. It is noteworthy that\nRousseau takes a different view in a text aimed at practical politics:\nConsiderations on the Government of Poland. Nevertheless, it\nis not entirely clear that the widespread interpretation of Rousseau\nas rejecting all forms of representative government is correct. One of\nthe key distinctions in The Social Contract is between\nsovereign and government. The sovereign, composed of the people as a\nwhole, promulgates laws as an expression of its general will. The\ngovernment is a more limited body that administers the state within\nthe bounds set by those laws, and which issues decrees applying them\nin particular cases. If the laws are conceived of as the people\nsetting a constitutional framework for society, with the\ngovernment\u2019s decrees comprising the more normal business of\n\u201clegislation,\u201d then the distance between a Rousseauian\nrepublic and a modern constitutional democracy may be smaller than it\nat first appears. In effect, while the sovereignty of the people may\nbe inconsistent with a representative model, the executive power of\nthe government can be understood as requiring it. Such a picture gains\ncredibility when the details of Rousseau\u2019s views on government\nare examined. Although a variety of forms of government turn out to be\ntheoretically compatible with popular sovereignty, Rousseau is\nsceptical about the prospects for both democracy (where the people\nconduct the day to day running of the state and the application of the\nlaws) and monarchy. Instead, he favors some form of elective\naristocracy: in other words, he supports the idea that the day-to-day\nadministration should be in the hands of a subset of the population,\nelected by them according to merit.\n\nTwo important issues arise in relation to Rousseau\u2019s account of\nrelations between sovereign and government. The first of these\nconcerns his political pessimism, even in the case of the\nbest-designed and most perfect republic. Just as any group has a\ncollective will as opposed to the individual private will of its\nmembers, so does the government. As the state becomes larger and more\ndiffuse, and as citizens become more distant from one another both\nspatially and emotionally, so the government of the republic will need\na proportionally smaller and more cohesive group of magistrates if its\nrule is to be effective. Rousseau thinks it almost inevitable that\nthis group will end up usurping the legitimate sovereign power of the\npeople and substituting its corporate will for the people\u2019s\ngeneral will. The second issue concerns how democratic Rousseau\nenvisaged his republic to be. He sometimes suggests a picture in which\nthe people would be subject to elite domination by the government,\nsince the magistrates would reserve the business of agenda-setting for\nthe assembly to themselves. In other cases, he endorses a conception\nof a more fully democratic republic. (For competing views of this\nquestion see Fralin 1978 and Cohen 2010.)\n\nAlthough Rousseau rejects Hobbes\u2019s view of the sovereign as\nrepresenting or acting in the person of the subject, he has a similar\nview of what sovereignty is and its relation to the rights of the\nindividual. He rejects the idea that individuals associated together\nin a political community retain some natural rights over themselves\nand their property. Rather, such rights as individuals have over\nthemselves, land, and external objects, are a matter of sovereign\ncompetence and decision. Individual rights must be specified by the\nsovereign in ways that are compatible with the interests of all in a\njust polity, and Rousseau rejects the idea that such rights could be\ninsisted on as a check on the sovereign\u2019s power.\n\nRousseau\u2019s commitment to the freedom and equality of citizens is\nmarred and limited to the fact that he envisages those citizens as\nexclusively male: women are subject to the authority of the state but\nhave no voice in the determination of the general will. While it is\ntempting for the modern reader simply to excuse this as reflective the\nprejudices of Rousseau\u2019s own times, his works are marked at\ntimes by a rather extreme misogyny which characterizes women as\nnecessarily inauthentic and fated to live in a world of appearance and\ndeception. Rousseau\u2019s insistence in Book I of the Social\nContract that the apparently slavish nature of some people might\nbe the consequence of their unjust subjection rather than a\njustification for it, is not a thought that he extends to the\nsubjection of women. Rousseau\u2019s inconsistencies and the tension\nbetween his liberatory philosophy and his exclusion of women was noted\nnot long after his death by Mary Wollstonecraft and has been the\nsubject of feminist critique in modern times (Fermon 1997,\nRousseli\u00e8re 2021, but see Rosenblatt 2002).\n3.5 Civil religion and toleration\n\nThe final full chapter of The Social Contract expounds\nRousseau\u2019s doctrine of civil religion. Contemporary readers were\nscandalized by it, and particularly by its claim that true (original\nor early) Christianity is useless in fostering the spirit of\npatriotism and social solidarity necessary for a flourishing state. In\nmany ways the chapter represents a striking departure from the main\nthemes of the book. First, it is the only occasion where Rousseau\nprescribes the content of a law that a just republic must have.\nSecond, it amounts to his acceptance of the inevitability of pluralism\nin matters of religion, and thus of religious toleration; this is in\nsome tension with his encouragement elsewhere of cultural homogeneity\nas a propitious environment for the emergence of a general will.\nThird, it represents a very concrete example of the limits of\nsovereign power: following Locke, Rousseau insists upon the inability\nof the sovereign to examine the private beliefs of citizens. The\ntenets of Rousseau\u2019s civil religion include the affirmation of\nthe existence of a supreme being and of the afterlife, the principle\nthat the just will prosper and the wicked will be punished, and the\nclaim that the social contract and the laws are sacred. In addition,\nthe civil religion requires the provision that all those willing to\ntolerate others should themselves be tolerated, but those who insist\nthat there is no salvation outside their particular church cannot be\ncitizens of the state. The structure of religious beliefs within the\njust state is that of an overlapping consensus: the dogmas of the\ncivil religion are such that they can be affirmed by adherents of a\nnumber of different faiths, both Christian and non-Christian.\n\nDespite Rousseau\u2019s concern for religious toleration both in the\nchapter and elsewhere, modern readers have often been repelled by one\nstriking note of intolerance. Rousseau argues that those who cannot\naccept the dogmas can be banished from the state. This is because he\nbelieves that atheists, having no fear of divine punishment, cannot be\ntrusted by their fellow citizens to obey the law. He goes even\nfurther, to suggest the death penalty for those who affirm the dogmas\nbut later act as if they do not believe them.\n4. Language\n\nRousseau\u2019s writings on language and languages are contained in\ntwo places, the unpublished Essay on the Origin of Languages\nand in a section of the Discourse on the Origins of\nInequality. In the Essay, Rousseau tells us that human\nbeings want to communicate as soon as they recognize that there are\nother beings like themselves. But he also raises the question of why\nlanguage, specifically, rather than gesture is needed for this\npurpose. The answer, strangely enough, is that language permits the\ncommunication of the passions in a way that gesture does not, and that\nthe tone and stress of linguistic communication are crucial, rather\nthan its content. This point enables Rousseau to make a close\nconnection between the purposes of speech and melody. Such vocabulary\nas there originally was, according to Rousseau, was merely figurative\nand words only acquire a literal meaning much later. Theories that\nlocate the origin of language in the need to reason together about\nmatters of fact are, according to Rousseau, deeply mistaken. While the\ncry of the other awakens our natural compassion and causes us to\nimagine the inner life of others, our purely physical needs have an\nanti-social tendency because they scatter human beings more widely\nacross the earth in search of subsistence. Although language and song\nhave a common origin in the need to communicate emotion, over time the\ntwo become separated, a process that becomes accelerated as a result\nof the invention of writing. In the south, language stays closer to\nits natural origins and southern languages retain their melodic and\nemotional quality (a fact that suits them for song and opera).\nNorthern languages, by contrast, become oriented to more practical\ntasks and are better for practical and theoretical reasoning.\n\nIn Part I of the Second Discourse, Rousseau\u2019s focus is\nslightly different and occurs in the context of a polemic against\nphilosophers (such as natural law theorists like Condillac) who\nattribute to primitive human beings a developed capacity for abstract\nreasoning. Rousseau proposes need as the cause of the development of\nlanguage, but since language depends on convention to assign arbitrary\nsigns to objects, he puzzles about how it could ever get started and\nhow primitive people could accomplish the feat of giving names to\nuniversals.\n5. Education\n\nRousseau\u2019s ideas about education are mainly expounded in\nEmile. In that work, he advances the idea of \u201cnegative\neducation\u201d, which is a form of \u201cchild-centered\u201d\neducation. His essential idea is that education should be carried out,\nso far as possible, in harmony with the development of the\nchild\u2019s natural capacities by a process of apparently autonomous\ndiscovery. This is in contrast to a model of education where the\nteacher is a figure of authority who conveys knowledge and skills\naccording to a pre-determined curriculum. Rousseau depends here on his\nthesis of natural goodness, which he asserts at the beginning of the\nbook, and his educational scheme involves the protection and\ndevelopment of the child\u2019s natural goodness through various\nstages, along with the isolation of the child from the domineering\nwills of others. Up to adolescence at least, the educational program\ncomprises a sequence of manipulations of the environment by the tutor.\nThe child is not told what to do or think but is led to draw its own\nconclusions as a result of its own explorations, the context for which\nhas been carefully arranged. The first stage of the program starts in\ninfancy, where Rousseau\u2019s crucial concern is to avoid conveying\nthe idea that human relations are essentially ones of domination and\nsubordination, an idea that can too easily by fostered in the infant\nby the conjunction of its own dependence on parental care and its\npower to get attention by crying. Though the young child must be\nprotected from physical harm, Rousseau is keen that it becomes\naccustomed to the exercise of its bodily powers and he therefore\nadvises that the child be left as free as possible rather than being\nconfined or constrained.\n\nFrom the age of about twelve or so, the program moves on to the\nacquisition of abstract skills and concepts. This is not done with the\nuse of books or formal lessons, but rather through practical\nexperience. The third phase of education coincides with puberty and\nearly adulthood. The period of isolation comes to an end and the child\nstarts to take an interest in others (particularly the opposite sex),\nand in how he is regarded. At this stage the great danger is that\nexcessive amour propre will extend to exacting recognition\nfrom others, disregarding their worth, and demanding subordination.\nThe task of the tutor is to ensure that the pupil\u2019s relations\nwith others are first mediated through the passion of\npiti\u00e9 (compassion) so that through the idea of the\nsuffering others, of care, and of gratitude, the pupil finds a secure\nplace for the recognition of his own moral worth where his amour\npropre is established on a non-competitive basis. The final\nperiod of education involves the tutor changing from a manipulator of\nthe child\u2019s environment into the adult\u2019s trusted advisor.\nThe young and autonomous adult finds a spouse who can be another\nsource of secure and non-competitive recognition. This final phase\nalso involves instruction into the nature of the social world,\nincluding the doctrines of Rousseau\u2019s political philosophy.\n\nIn addition to Rousseau\u2019s theory of education for an individual,\nhe also addresses the topic of mass education for citizens, primarily\nin the Discourse on Political Economy and in\nConsiderations on the Government of Poland. There, his stress\nis on the formation of patriotic citizens, committed to the general\nwill and the law, and on education as being one of the primary\nresponsibilities of magistrates. He deplores class segregation in\neducation and argues for the desirability of common institutions for\nall, either free or at an affordable charge.\n6. Place in the history of philosophy\n\nIn the course of his work, Rousseau engaged intellectually with a wide\nrange of predecessors and contemporaries, and was deeply influenced by\nancient writers, perhaps especially Plato. The most immediate\ninfluences on his political philosophy include Montesquieu, Hobbes,\nLocke, Mandeville and Diderot. Hobbes\u2019s conception of sovereign\npower, duly transmuted by Rousseau\u2019s rejection of the notion of\nrepresentative sovereignty, clearly marks the Social\nContract, and Rousseau sometimes claimed that all he was doing\nwas to restate Locke, though this has often been read with some\nperplexity (Brooke 2009). Among the contemporary philosophers who\nengaged closely with Rousseau\u2019s work was Adam Smith, who\nfamously reviewed the Discourse on Inequality for the\nEdinburgh Review (Griswold 2018). Rousseau\u2019s thinking\nhas had a profound influence on later philosophers and political\ntheorists, although the tensions and ambiguities in his work have\nmeant that his ideas have been developed in radically incompatible and\ndivergent ways. In modern political philosophy, for example, it is\npossible to detect Rousseau as a source of inspiration for liberal\ntheories, communitarian ideas, civic republicanism, and in theories of\ndeliberative and participatory democracy. Hostile writers have\nportrayed Rousseau as a source of inspiration for the more\nauthoritarian aspects of the French revolution and thence for aspects\nof fascism and communism.\n\nRousseau\u2019s most important philosophical impact was on Immanuel\nKant. A portrait of Rousseau was the only image on display in\nKant\u2019s house, and legend has it that the only time that Kant\nforgot to take his daily walk was when reading Emile.\nInstances of direct influence include Kant\u2019s idea of the\ncategorical imperative, the third formulation of which in the\nGroundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals (the so-called formula\nof the kingdom of ends) recalls Rousseau\u2019s discussion of the\ngeneral will in The Social Contract. Ironically, Kant\u2019s\ndetachment of the idea of universal legislation from its context in\nthe particularity of single society reverses Rousseau\u2019s own\napproach, since Rousseau had, in preparatory work for The Social\nContract rejected the idea of a general will of the human race as\nthat notion appeared in Diderot\u2019s article \u201cNatural\nRight\u201d in the Encyclop\u00e9die. Rousseau\u2019s\ninfluence can also be seen in Kant\u2019s moral psychology,\nespecially in work such as Religion Within the Limits of Reason\nAlone, in Kant\u2019s own thinking about conjectural history,\nand in his writings on international justice which draw on\nRousseau\u2019s engagement with the work of the Abb\u00e9 St.\nPierre.\n\nThe cases of Hegel and Marx are more complex. Hegel\u2019s direct\nreferences to Rousseau are often uncomplimentary. In the\nPhilosophy of Right, while praising Rousseau for the idea\nthat will is the basis of the state, he misrepresents the idea of the\ngeneral will as being merely the idea of the overlap between the\ncontingent wills of private individuals. In the Encyclopedia\nLogic he demonstrates an awareness that this was not\nRousseau\u2019s view. Hegel\u2019s discussion of the master-slave\ndialectic and the problem of recognition in the Phenomenology of\nSpirit also draws on Rousseau, in this case on the notion of\namour propre and the ways in which attempts to exact respect\nand recognition from others can be self-defeating. Karl Marx\u2019s\nconcerns with alienation and exploitation have also been thought to\nbear some kind of relationship to Rousseau\u2019s thinking on related\ntopics. Here the evidence is more indirect, since the references to\nRousseau in Marx\u2019s work are few and insubstantial.\n\nIn contemporary political philosophy, it is clear that the thinking of\nJohn Rawls, especially in A Theory of Justice reflects the\ninfluence of Rousseau and Rawls himself referred to his two principles\nof justice as an effort to \u201cspell out the content of the general\nwill\u201d (Cohen 2010, p.2; Brooke 2015). A good example of\nRousseau\u2019s influence is the way in which Rawls uses the device\nof the \u201coriginal position\u201d to put self-interested choice\nat the service of the determination of the principles of justice. This\nexactly parallels Rousseau\u2019s argument that citizens will be\ndrawn to select just laws as if from an impartial perspective, because\nthe universality and generality of the law means that when considering\ntheir own interests they will select the measure that best reflects\ntheir own interests.
