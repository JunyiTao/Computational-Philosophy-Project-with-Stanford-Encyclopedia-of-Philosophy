    "main_text": "The Morality and Rationality of Suicide || Moral Permissibility\n3.1 Moral Permissibility\n\nThe principal moral issue surrounding suicide has long been whether\nthere are conditions under which suicide is morally justified, and if\nso, which conditions. Several important historical answers to this\nquestion have already been mentioned.\n\nThis question should be distinguished from three others:\n\nShould other individuals attempt to prevent suicide?\nShould the state criminalize suicide or attempt to prevent\nit?\nIs suicide ever rational or prudent?\n\n\nThese four questions interrelate in complex ways. For instance, it\nmight be assumed that if suicide is morally permissible in some\ncircumstances, then neither other individuals nor the state should\ninterfere with suicidal behavior (in those same circumstances).\nHowever, this conclusion might not follow if those same suicidal\nindividuals are irrational and interference is required in order to\nprevent them from taking their lives, an outcome they would regret\nwere they more fully rational. Furthermore, for those moral theories\nthat emphasize rational autonomy, whether an individual has rationally\nchosen to take her own life may settle all four questions. In any\nevent, the interrelationships among suicide\u2019s moral\npermissibility, its rationality, and the duties of others and of\nsociety as a whole is complex, and we should be wary of assuming that\nan answer to any one of these four questions decisively settles the\nother three.\n",
