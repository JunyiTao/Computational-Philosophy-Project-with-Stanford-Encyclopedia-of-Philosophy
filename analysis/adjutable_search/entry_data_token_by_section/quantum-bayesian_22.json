Conclusion\n\nA variety of QBist and pragmatist views of quantum theory have been\nproposed since quantum theory assumed close to its present form. In\nrecent years this has been an active area of research especially by\nphilosophically aware physicists working in quantum foundations.\nPhilosophers have tended to dismiss such approaches, objecting to\ntheir instrumentalism and/or anti-realism. But there is much to learn\nfrom responses to such objections and good philosophical\nreasons to take these views more seriously.\n",
