    "main_text": "Do works of art exist? || Idealism\n1.5 Idealism\n\n\nIt would be quite misleading to give the impression that all of those\nphilosophers who thought minds and their activities have something to\ndo with the existence of works of art also thought that this means\nthat works were somehow less real than, say, natural physical entities\nand events. Idealists invert this hierarchy. This is explicit in\nBenedetto Croce (1913, 1965, 9\u201310) when he asserts that works of\nart cannot be physical entities because works of art are\n\u201csupremely real\u201d whereas the physical world is\n\u201cunreal.\u201d\n\n\nAnother proponent of an idealist ontology of art is Waldemar Conrad\n(1908\u201309). Conrad stressed Edmund Husserl\u2019s contrast\nbetween \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cphenomenological\u201d\nattitudes and their objects (for background, see the entries on\nHusserl and phenomenology). Conrad asserts that only the latter\nattitude can reveal the \u201cideal Object\u201d that is the genuine\nor intended [gemeinte] work of art. In his example, which\ncould well have served as the counterpoint for Sartre\u2019s\ndiscussion of Beethoven\u2019s Seventh Symphony, the genuine work is\nthe symphony itself as opposed to the various spatiotemporal events,\nsuch as more or less competent orchestral performances, or\nsomeone\u2019s whistling the melody or reading the score, that might\nhelp to direct attention to some of the work\u2019s essential\nfeatures (1908\u201309, 77\u201378). Conrad does not present a\ndetailed defense of his assumptions about the ontology of ideal\nobjects, but clearly shared Husserl\u2019s aversion to psychologism\n(for background, see the entry on psychologism).\n\n\nCroce\u2019s (1902, 1913, 1948) claims about works (and ideas) as\n\u201cexpressions\u201d of experience generated a lot of controversy\nand did much to put ontological issues on the agenda of aesthetics and\nthe philosophy of art (for background, see the entry on Croce\u2019s\naesthetics). British proponents of Croce-inspired aesthetics\nincluded Lascelles Abercrombie (1922), who promoted the idea that the\nwork is an experience, and P. Leon (1931), who rhapsodized about the\naesthetic object as an experienced quale. Drawing upon a\nbroad Platonic and Romantic background, George W. Beiswanger (1939)\ndeveloped the view that the \u201cmaterial\u201d work is merely a\nmeans to the aesthetic object, which he characterized as\n\u201cexperienced experiencing,\u201d an idea inspired, apparently,\nby John Dewey\u2019s remark that \u201cthe actual work of art is what\nthe product does with and in experience\u201d (1934, 3).\n\n\nBy far the most influential Croce-inspired aesthetician was Robin\nGeorge Collingwood (1925, 1938), whose several translations of\nCroce\u2019s work helped make the Italian philosopher\u2019s views\nmore accessible to readers bereft of Italian (for background and\nreferences, see Alan Donagan 1972). As Collingwood\u2019s\nphilosophy of art is the subject of a separate entry as well as various\ncommentaries (e.g., Ian Winchester 2004, David Davies 2008), we can be\nbrief here. For some purposes talk of a\n\u201cCroce-Collingwood\u201d theory of art is good enough, but of\ncourse differences come to the fore when one reads these authors with\nan eye to detail. It seems fair to say that for Collingwood, the\nwork of art is not a physical object or finished artifact, but the\nconscious imaginative activity through which creative expression takes\nplace. That works are the activity of the imagination does not\nmake them any less real in Collingwood\u2019s opinion.\n\n\nAn objection to all theories that invite us to think of\nworks of art as experiences\u2014those of the artist and/or those of\nthe audience\u2014is that this is a conflation of an experience and\nthe object of the experience. It is one thing to acknowledge that\na work is the product or even the expression of an experience and\nthat it is designed to occasion certain kinds of experiences; it is\nsomething else entirely to assert that the work is itself an experience\nand nothing more. Such an account neglects the physical\ndimensions of art, beginning with the artist\u2019s encounter with\nmaterials and media. It is also objected that the attempted\nreduction of artworks to experiences would convert a public, culturally\nsituated entity into something private. Early worries of this\nsort were articulated in relation to Croce\u2019s aesthetics by\nAlexander (1925) and Louis Arnauld Reid (1926). More recently,\nthese objections have been raised against Roger Scruton\u2019s (1997)\nontology of musical works by Jerrold Levinson (2000), who explicitly\nlinks Scruton\u2019s account to the legacy of Collingwood and\nidealism.\n\n\nNot all philosophers have agreed that all works of art must be\npublic. In his taxonomy of the fine arts, Bernard Bolzano\ndistinguishes between the arts of the external senses and those of\npure thought (1849, 16). The latter arts produce works comprised of\ncomplex ideas or thoughts that are not linguistically articulated and\nthat are only directly accessible to the person thinking of\nthem. Bolzano remarks that this feature of the arts of pure thought is\na great imperfection. He adds, however, that these arts often play a\nrole in the creation of those works of art, such as statues and songs,\nthat are perceptible to audiences.\n",
