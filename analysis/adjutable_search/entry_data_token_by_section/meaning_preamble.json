    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201ctheory of meaning\u201d has figured, in one way or\nanother, in a great number of philosophical disputes over the last\ncentury. Unfortunately, this term has also been used to mean a great\nnumber of different things.  In this entry, the focus is on two sorts\nof \u201ctheory of meaning\u201d. The first sort of theory\u2014a\nsemantic theory\u2014is a theory which assigns semantic contents to\nexpressions of a language. The second sort of theory\u2014a\nfoundational theory of meaning\u2014is a theory which states the\nfacts in virtue of which expressions have the semantic contents that\nthey have.  Following a brief introduction, these two kinds of theory\nare discussed in turn.\n",
