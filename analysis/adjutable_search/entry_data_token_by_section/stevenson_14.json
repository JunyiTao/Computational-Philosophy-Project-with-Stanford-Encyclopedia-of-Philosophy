    "main_text": "Objections to Stevenson\u2019s Emotivism || Objections to Stevenson\u2019s Account of Moral Language\n5.2 Objections to Stevenson\u2019s Account of Moral Language\n\nObjections also arise in connection of Stevenson\u2019s account of the\nmeaning of moral language.\n\nObjections from Illocutionary/Perlocutionary Conflation.\nStevenson claims repeatedly that moral language is used to express a\nspeaker\u2019s attitudes or to evoke or otherwise shape the attitudes of\nothers. One might worry that this involves conflation of illocutionary\nacts and perlocutionary intentions (e.g., Hare 1952 Section 1.7 and\n1997 Sections 1\u20135\u20131.6; Urmson 1968). Illocutionary acts\nare the acts that a speaker performs in uttering a sentence: warning,\nadvising, describing, commanding, and so on. Like sentences,\nillocutionary acts are subject to logical constraints\u2014it would\nbe logically inconsistent, in some intuitive sense, to direct one\u2019s\nhearer to both close and open a particular window (\u2018Close that\nwindow and open that same window\u2019), for example. Since sentences\nand the illocutionary acts they are typically used to perform have\nsimilar logical constraints, illocutionary acts may plausibly be\nassociated in some appropriate way with the meanings of sentences. Now\nwhen a speaker performs an illocutionary act in uttering a sentence,\nshe often does so with particular intentions or effects in mind. For\nexample, knowing that her audience often attempts to annoy her by\ndoing the opposite of what she asks, a speaker may utter \u2018Keep\nthe window closed\u2019 with the intention that her audience will in\nfact open the window. Thus, there need be no logical\ninconsistency between directing one to keep a particular window closed\nand an intention that the window be opened. Thus, it is concluded,\nperlocutionary intention ought not be associated with the semantics or\nmeanings of sentences. The Objection from Illocutionary/Perlocutionary\nConflation, then, is that Stevenson\u2019s theory of meaning incorporates\nthat which is irrelevant to semantics, namely perlocutionary\nintentions. This objection is related to the next.\n\nThe Objection from Instrumentalism. Stevenson\u2019s theory may\nseem to be an \u201cinstrumentalist\u201d theory that explains the\nmeaning of moral sentences by appealing to the illocutionary acts they\nare typically used to perform, that is, to their typical illocutionary\nforces. However, a great many uses of moral sentences fail to have\nsuch force. For example, when moral sentence 1 is used in utterances\nof sentences 2 or 3, it is used without its usual expressive\nforce.\n\nInsulting others is wrong.\nIf insulting others is wrong, I\u2019ll stop.\nIt is possible that insulting others is wrong.\n\n\nThus, the objection goes, Stevenson\u2019s theory of meaning leaves too\nmuch unsaid about a great many uses of ethical language, and\nconsequently, is radically incomplete.\n\nThese last two objections are understandable, given how often\nStevenson appeals to the uses and purposes of moral language.\nNevertheless, they miss their mark, for Stevenson\u2019s theory of meaning\nis not an \u201cinstrumentalist\u201d theory of meaning, but rather\na dispositional theory\n (Section 3.2;\n Urmson 1968, Ch. 4; Warnock 1978, Ch. 3). Stevenson associates the\nmeaning of a word or sentence with neither perlocutionary intentions\nnor with illocutionary force, but rather with the conjunction or union\nof its passive and active dispositions.\n\nThe Frege-Geach Objection. Because Stevenson\u2019s theory is\noften thought to succumb to the Objection from Instrumentalism, it is\nalso thought to succumb to the Frege-Geach Objection, perhaps the most\npressing objection to any emotivist or expressivist theory of meaning.\nThis objection is so-called because Peter Geach (1958, 1960, 1965),\nrelying on insights from Frege (e.g., 1918), argued persuasively that\na sentence\u2019s illocutionary force cannot constitute its meaning. The\nstrength of the Frege-Geach Objection arises from the fact that\nnatural languages are compositional and, thus, that a minimal\ncondition of adequacy on any semantic theory is that it specify that\nwhich sentences contribute to the more complex sentences into which\nthey are embeddable. For example, a minimally adequate semantic theory\nfor English will entail that the meaning of sentence 1. remains the\nsame when it is embedded within sentences 2. or 3., since an\nunderstanding of the latter sentences rests on an understanding of\ntheir respective parts, including 1., and of the significance of the\nway those parts are combined. However, since (it is thought)\nStevenson\u2019s theory of meaning holds that moral sentences are used to\nexpress a speaker\u2019s attitudes\u2014i.e., used with expressive\nillocutionary force\u2014and since moral sentences are often used as\nparts of more complex sentences without such expressive force, as in\nsentences 2. and 3., Stevenson has failed to provide a minimally\nadequate theory of meaning for moral sentences.\n\nThe Frege-Geach objection may ultimately undermine Stevenson\u2019s theory\nof moral language, though not, as because his theory identifies a\nsentence\u2019s meaning with the illocutionary force of its utterance.\nAssociating a sentence\u2019s meaning instead with the set of its passive\nand active dispositions, Stevenson\u2019s theory of meaning implies that\nsentences will have relatively stable meanings across contexts of use\n (Sections 3.1\n and\n 3.2),\n and therefore, that these dispositions might themselves be\ncontributed to the more complex sentences into which they embed.\nPrecisely how Stevenson\u2019s dispositional theory could be extended to\naccount for compositionality in this way is unclear, and Stevenson\nhimself appears never to have been sufficiently worried by the\nFrege-Geach objection to respond to it. One idea would be that\nsentential operators, such as \u2018if \u2026 then\u2019 and\n\u2018it is possible that\u2019 be treated as functions from the\ndispositions of the component sentences to a resulting set of\ndispositions, where the latter would constitute the meaning of the\ncomplex sentence. Stevenson hints at such a possible extension of his\ntheory while discussing the compositionality of atomic sentences:\n\n\nNo attempt has been made here to deal with one of the most difficult\nproblems that meaning-theory includes\u2014that of explaining how\nseparate words, each one with its own meaning, can combine to yield\nsentence-meanings. It is feasible, perhaps, to take each word as\nhaving a disposition to affect cognition, just as the full sentence\ndoes. The problem reduces, then, to one of explaining the interplay of\nthe dispositions of the several words, when realized conjointly. The\nanalogy of the magnets will still serve, used now to illustrate the\nrelationship of meanings rather than of beliefs. We\nmay compare the meaning of each word with the disposition of some one\nof the magnets, and compare the meaning of the sentence with the\ndisposition that may be assigned to the group of magnets. Each word\nhas an independent meaning in the sense that if it is replaced by\ncertain others in any context, there will be a typical sort of\ndifference in the meaning of the context; but the precise way in which\nthe word\u2019s meaning is realized will depend on the meaning of the other\nwords that accompany it. (1944, 67)\n\n\nSince Stevenson suggests that he might explain the compositionality of\natomic sentences in terms of functions from the dispositions of a\nsentence\u2019s parts to a set of resulting dispositions, it is plausible\nthat he might also wish to extend his theory in a similar way to\nexplain the compositionality of complex sentences. Whether such a\ntheory could sustain additional scrutiny is debatable. For more\nin-depth but accessible discussion of emotivist and expressivist\nattempts to respond to the Frege-Geach Objection, see especially\nSchroeder 2008 and 2010 and the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism.\n",
