Theoretical Frameworks\n\nAs we look to particular accounts of understanding, it will help to\nconsider in turn:\n\nunderstanding\u2019s distinctive object (or objects),\nits distinctive psychology, and\nthe distinctive sort of normative relationship that needs to hold\nbetween the psychology of the person who understands and the object of\nhis or her understanding.\n\n\nBy way of comparison, consider the traditional \u201cjustified true\nbelief\u201d analysis of knowledge. On this view, knowledge involves\na distinctive object (roughly, the truth, or a true proposition), a\ndistinctive psychology (the psychological act of belief or assent),\nand a distinctive normative relationship that needs to hold between\nthe psychology of the believer and the thing believed (namely, that\none\u2019s belief in the true proposition needs to be justified, in\nsome sense).\n\nWhat can be said, in a parallel way, about the elements of\nunderstanding?\n",
