    "main_text": "God-world Relationship || Divine Knowledge\n5.3 Divine Knowledge\n\nIf God possesses will, then He must also possess wisdom, since\ndeliberation and choosing assume knowledge of the thing that is\nwilled. That is to say, the God-world relationship is based on will\nand wisdom. In discussing the nature of divine knowledge, Albalag\ndisplays an obsession with divine perfection. Thus, he differentiates\nbetween divine and human knowledge on the basis of type rather than\nrank, removing any ground for comparing them or inferring premises\nabout God\u2019s mode of apprehension and knowledge from the\ncharacteristics of human knowledge and cognition. This idea of the\ndistinctiveness of divine knowledge, and, indeed all divine\nattributes, is best expressed in terms of Maimonides\u2019 theory of\nequivocation. According to Maimonides, terms such as wisdom, power and\nwill are predicated of God and creatures only equivocally. When\npredicated of God and other creatures, these terms are semantically\ndissimilar, sharing only the names rather than meaning (Guide\nI:56; cf. Tiqqun n.23: 24). Epistemologically speaking,\nmoreover, they are not informative; constituting an artificial\nlanguage, which we predicate of God owing to our inability to fathom\nand signify the corresponding characteristics in Him (Benor 1995;\nStern 2013: 198\u2013204).\n\nOn this conception of divine attributes, Albalag examines\nAvicenna\u2019s theory of divine knowledge, as reproduced by\nal-Ghazali in the Maq\u0101\u1e63id, according to which\n\u201cGod knows particulars in a universal fashion\u201d\n(Maq\u0101\u1e63id: 118). Avicenna\u2019s theory of divine\nknowledge has been subject to different interpretations (Marmura 1962:\n299\u2013312; Adamson 2005: 257\u2013278; Belo 2006: 177\u2013199).\nFor Albalag, it simply means that God\u2019s knowledge is universal.\nSince this way of articulating divine knowledge implies a\ncorrespondence between divine and human knowledge, Albalag naturally\nrejects it and scolds al-Ghazali for diffusing improper doctrines\nabout God. In opposition, he insists that God\u2019s knowledge is\nopposite in characteristics, not merely superior in rank, to human\nknowledge: it is neither particular nor universal, it is atemporal,\nindivisible, absolutely actual and self-sufficient, being exclusively\ndependent on the mode of self-intellection which is peculiar to God\nand separate intellects (Tiqqun n.42:  76).\n\nGiven this radical notion of transcendency, it would seem that the\ncelestial realm and sublunary species and individuals lie beyond the\ndomain of God\u2019s knowledge. But Albalag insists that God\u2019s\nknowledge is all-encompassing. To establish this, he appropriates\nAverroes\u2019 conception of the divine essence as a unified Form of\nthe forms of all existents (Averroes Commentary on\nMetaphysics: 197). Through the very act of self-intellection,\nGod, as Albalag concludes, apprehends all existents, including\nsublunary existents (Tiqqun n.42: 66). This conclusion is\naccompanied by an important clarification for the sake of maintaining\ndivine perfection and transcendence unimpaired: forms contained in the\nessence of God do not exactly correspond to the forms of sublunary\nthings insofar as they are material objects, but exist in the divine\nessence in the noblest possible manner, being absolutely simple,\nindivisible and independent of accidents.\n",
