    "main_text": "\n\nQuantum Field Theory (QFT) is the mathematical and conceptual\nframework for contemporary elementary particle physics. It is also a\nframework used in other areas of theoretical physics, such as\ncondensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. In a rather\ninformal sense QFT is the extension of quantum mechanics (QM), dealing\nwith particles, over to fields, i.e., systems with an infinite number\nof degrees of freedom. (See the entry on\n quantum mechanics.)\nIn the last decade QFT has become a more widely discussed\ntopic in philosophy of science, with questions ranging from\nmethodology and semantics to ontology. QFT taken seriously in its\nmetaphysical implications seems to give a picture of the world which\nis at variance with central classical conceptions of particles and\nfields, and even with some features of QM.\n\nThe following sketches how QFT describes fundamental physics and what\nthe status of QFT is among other theories of physics. Since there is a\nstrong emphasis on those aspects of the theory that are particularly\nimportant for interpretive inquiries, it does not replace an\nintroduction to QFT as such. One main group of target readers are\nphilosophers who want to get a first impression of some issues that\nmay be of interest for their own work, another target group are\nphysicists who are interested in a philosophical view upon QFT.\n\n",
