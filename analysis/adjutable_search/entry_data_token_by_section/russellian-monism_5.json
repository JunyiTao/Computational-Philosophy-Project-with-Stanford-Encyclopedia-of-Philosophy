Suppose someone is having a\nphenomenally blue experience. If constitutive Russellian\nmonism is true, then the phenomenal blueness of that experience\nconsists wholly in certain quiddities, perhaps structured in a certain\nway (for the distinction between constitutive and non-constitutive\nRussellian monism, see Section 4.2). But on many varieties of\nRussellian monism, quiddities are micro-level features. On the face of\nit, it seems possible that those (or any) micro-level quiddities could\nbe instantiated without anyone having that (or any)\nexperience\u2014and that seems possible no matter how they are\nstructured. If that is possible, then how could phenomenal blueness\nconsist wholly in (structured) quiddities, as constitutive Russellian\nmonists hold? Essentially the same problem seems to arise for other\nvarieties of constitutive Russellian monism, such as those on which\nquiddities are construed as cosmophenomenal features (Goff 2009;\nPereboom 2011, 114; Chalmers 2013, 2017).\n\nThat is one version of the combination problem, but there are others.\nConsider one raised for a version of constitutive Russellian\npanspsychism, according to which microphenomenal quiddities, perhaps\ntogether with structural properties, combine to constitute\nmacrophenomenal properties. The problem can be stated as an objection,\nas follows. The constitutive Russellian panpsychist is committed to\nthe following two claims. First, corresponding to each instance of a\nmicrophenomenal quiddity underlying a physical disposition there is a\nunique conscious subject: a microsubject distinct from the\nmicrosubjects that correspond to other such instances of\nmicrophenomenal quiddities. Second, multiple microsubjects\ncorresponding to microphenomenal quiddities combine to constitute a\nsingle macrosubject. But it is unclear how that second claim could be\ntrue. As William James (1890: 162) suggests, given any group of\nsubjects and any further subject, it seems possible for the group to\nexist without that further subject existing. This is known the\nsubject-summing problem (Goff 2009, 2017; Chalmers 2013, 2017;\nColeman 2014).\n\nSome respond to such combination problems by appealing to a Leibnizian\nunderrepresentation thesis (Pereboom 2011: 114\u2013115), on which\nintrospective awareness of phenomenal states fails to represent them\nas having microfeatures they do in fact have (Leibniz, Discourse\non Metaphysics, \u00a730 [G IV, 458\u201359; IV, 574\u2013575];\nPereboom 1991b, 2011: 9, n. 1; cf. Stoljar 2001: 276). Consider the\nversion of the combination problem stated two paragraphs back,\ninvolving the constitution of phenomenal blueness. On the Leibnizian\nunderrepresentation thesis, even if one introspects one\u2019s\nexperience as featuring only noncomplex phenomenal blueness,\nphenomenal blueness might in fact be constituted by an unrepresented\narray of (proto)phenomenal quiddities. To support that claim, one\nmight draw an analogy to a macrophenomenal property that is\nconstituted by other macrophenomenal properties. For example,\na taste experience might appear simple and unconstituted even if in\nfact it is constituted by a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter,\nand umami (as Louis DeRosset has suggested in conversation; see\nPereboom 2011: 115). Likewise, the response continues, perhaps all\nmacrophenomenal features are constituted by (proto)phenomenal\nquiddities, or by quiddities and structural features, which\nintrospection fails to reveal.\n\nHowever, that response is only partial. It might show that\nintrospection alone does not rule out the possibility that\nmacrophenomenal properties are constituted by quiddities or by\nquiddities and structure. But the response does not explain how\nmacrophenomenal properties might result from such constituents.\nAlthough some explanations have been proposed (e.g., Rosenberg 2004,\n2015, M\u00f8rch 2019), many regard the combination problem for\nRussellian monism as unsolved and serious (see the entry\n panpsychism;\n Br\u00fcntrup and Jaskolla 2017; Chalmers 2017).\n\nSeveral other objections to Russellian monism have been raised in the\nrecent literature, of which we will describe four. The first is\nrelated to the combination problem and applies only to Russellian\npanprotopsychism. It is argued that Russellian panprotopsychism faces\nthe following sort of \u201crevenge\u201d problem. Russellian monism\nis motivated partly by its ability to provide plausible responses to\ninfluential anti-physicalist arguments, such as the conceivability and\nknowledge arguments\n (section 3.1).\n Those arguments usually begin by attacking allegedly implausible\nepistemic commitments of certain traditional physicalist views (such\nas analytic functionalism), such as the claim that structural truths\nalone a priori entail all phenomenal truths. However, some\nargue, parallel considerations undermine the Russellian\npanprotopsychist\u2019s claim that protophenomenal truths and\nstructural truths together a priori entail all phenomenal\ntruths (Strawson 2006a,b; Goff 2015, 2017). Thus, for example, it is\nargued that while still in the black-and-white room Mary can come to\nknow all the protophenomenal truths just as easily as she can come to\nknow all the structural truths, and still not thereby be positioned to\nknow what it is like to see red (for related objections to Russellian\nmonism, see Cutter 2019, Botin 2023, and Mendelow forthcoming).\n\nIn response, some deny that the two a priori entailment\nclaims are on a par (Alter 2018). Mary could come to know any\nstructural truth while still in the room, the response runs, because\nany structural truth can be fully conveyed in the colorless language\nof objective science. But protophenomenal properties are\nnon-structural. So, perhaps some protophenomenal truths cannot be\nfully conveyed in such colorless language. If so, then the Russellian\npanprotopsychist\u2019s a priori entailment claim might not\nmeet the same fate as the one associated with certain traditional\nphysicalist theories.\n\nA second recent objection, developed by Amy Kind (2015), is that\nRussellian monism is unmotivated. The theory is often advanced as\nproviding insight into the mind\u2013body problem: insight that has\neluded traditional dualists and traditional physicalists\n (section 3.1).\n However, Kind points out, Russellian monism fails to resolve the most\ncentral issue in the debate: whether consciousness is a fundamental\ncomponent of the universe. On Russellian panpsychism consciousness is\na fundamental component of the universe, whereas on Russellian\npanprotopsychism it is not. Thus, Russellian monism leaves us\n\u201cessentially back where we started\u201d (Kind 2015: 420; cf.\nLiu 2021, which compares the view to Thomistic hylomorphism and claims\nthat Russellian monism has similar problems). In response, it has been\nargued that this charge misunderstands Russellian monism\u2019s aims\n(Alter and Coleman 2020a). Russellian monism does not purport to\nsettle whether consciousness is a fundamental component of the\nuniverse. Rather, the theory is meant to provide a framework in which\nthat issue (and others) can be more productively addressed\u2014a\nframework provided by neither traditional physicalism nor traditional\ndualism.\n\nA third recent objection is that Russellian monism, despite its aims,\nfails to adequately integrate consciousness into physical causation.\nOne version of this objection begins with the premise that, on\nRussellian monism, a single type of physical disposition might have\nbeen grounded by a distinct quiddity from the quiddity that actually\ngrounds it (Howell 2015; cf. Robinson 1993). For example, if in the\nactual world quiddity Q1 grounds negative charge, then there is a\nmetaphysically possible world in which a distinct quiddity Q2 grounds\nnegative charge; the grounding relationship between quiddities and\nphysical dispositions is in this way metaphysically contingent. If so,\nthe argument continues, then quiddities (even if they exist) do not\nmake any distinctive contribution to physical causation. With respect\nto physical causation, quiddities are \u201cjust along for the causal\nride\u201d (Howell 2015: 34). On another version of the objection,\neven if quiddities contribute to physical causation, consciousness\ndoes not thereby inherit any physical efficacy, contrary to what\nRussellian monists claim (Robinson 2018; cf. Chan 2020, 2021).\n\nIn response to the first version of that objection, on which\nquiddities lack physical efficacy, some reject the assumption that any\nsuch conclusion follows from the premise that a single type of\nphysical disposition might have been grounded by a distinct quiddity\nfrom the quiddity that actually grounds it (Hawthorne 2002, Alter and\nColeman 2020a, 2021). Causal relations, it is argued, do not in\ngenerally hold with metaphysical necessity. So, why must the\nrelationship between quiddities and dispositions hold with such\nnecessity, if quiddities are to be physically efficacious? Another\nresponse is to reject the premise that on Russellian monism that\nrelationship is metaphysically contingent (Chalmers 2013 [2015:\n264\u2013265]; M\u00f8rch 2014, 2019; Gundersen 2015; Kadi\u0107\n2017; Alter and Coleman 2020a, 2021). In response to the second\nversion of the objection, on which consciousness does not inherit any\nphysical efficacy from that of quiddities (even if quiddities partly\nor wholly constitute consciousness), one might argue that this charge\nis just an instance of a general worry concerning micro-to-macro\ncausal exclusion, which does not concern consciousness or Russellian\nmonism specifically. (See the entry\n mental causation;\n Goff 2017: 153\u2013158)\n\nA fourth recent objection to Russellian monism targets the distinction\nbetween the structural and the non-structural. Some argue that this\ndistinction cannot be explicated in the way that Russellian monism\nrequires. As noted above\n (section 1.1),\n some have made proposals for how to explicate that distinction. Those\nproposals render structuralism about physics consistent with the claim\nphysics describes some intrinsic properties, thus safeguarding\nstructuralism about physics from one line of attack. But whether any\nof those proposals is fully adequate for the purposes of Russellian\nmonism is disputed (Stoljar 2015). Other, related objections have been\nraised, e.g., that the dispositional/categorical distinction does not\napply to physical properties in the way that Russellian monism implies\n(Hiddleston 2019; but see Alter and Pereboom 2023; for other\nobjections concerning the Russellian monist\u2019s\nstructural/non-structural distinction, see Stoljar 2006, 2009, 2014,\n2015; Ney 2015; for responses, see Pereboom 2011, 2014, 2015; Alter\n2009, 2016).\n",
