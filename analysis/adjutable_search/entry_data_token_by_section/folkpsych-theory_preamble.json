    "main_text": "\n\nFolk psychology is a name traditionally used to denote our everyday\nway of understanding, or rationalizing, intentional actions in\nmentalistic terms. This quotidian competence is known by other names\nin the philosophical literature: commonsense psychology; na\u00efve\npsychology; Homo sapiens psychology; the person theory of\nhumans; the intentional stance; propositional attitude psychology;\nbelief-desire psychology (see, e.g., Churchland 1979; Dennett 1987;\nGoldman 2006; Bogdan 2009). As some entries on this list suggest, folk\npsychology can be conceived of in wider or more narrow terms, picking\nout different extensions accordingly.\n\nThere is great interest in folk psychology not only because of its\nstatus as a familiar way of making sense of our actions and those of\nothers but also because it is thought to underwrite a range of moral,\nlegal, educational, clinical, and therapeutic practices (Fodor 1987;\nBaker 1988). For this reason, a great deal of work in analytic\nphilosophy has been devoted to better understanding folk psychology\nand its cognitive basis.\n\nThis entry reviews reasons for and against thinking that folk\npsychological competence entails or is best explained by having some\nkind of theory of mind\u2014a view known as theory theory.\n\nThe first two sections of this entry seek mainly to explicate theory\ntheory and its possible variations. Section 1 describes the core\ncommitments of theory theory, and the traditional reasons offered for\nbelieving in it\u2014noting the assumptions that theory theorists\ntraditionally embrace about the primary function of folk psychology,\nand the various, heavier or lighter, options they have for construing\nits ontological commitments. Section 2 details three varieties of\ntheory theory, looking at where they disagree about such things as:\nwhat kind of theory folk psychology is; whether it is concept-based or\nmodel-based; whether and how it is acquired; and whether and how it\ndevelops.\n\nSection 3 discusses a body of noteworthy empirical findings\u2014from\ncomparative psychology, developmental psychology, neuroscience, and\ncross-cultural psychology\u2014which must be accommodated or dealt\nwith by any credible account of folk psychology.\n\nSection 4 focuses on philosophical challenges that have been raised\nagainst theory theory. This section sketches eliminativist arguments\nfor thinking that folk psychology is a theory, but one that the mature\nsciences of the mind should supersede, rejecting its central posits.\nIt considers the challenge raised by the main rival to theory\ntheory\u2014the simulation theory, which assumes the core processes\nby which we understand others in mentalistic terms are not grounded in\nany kind of theory. It explicates the concerns of phenomenological\ncritics of theory theory, who argue that to characterize folk\npsychology as any kind of theory systematically misconstrues the\ntarget explanandum. It reviews pluralist reasons for thinking that\nfolk psychology has many varied uses\u2014a possibility that, on the\nmost extreme renderings, casts doubt on folk psychology\u2019s being\nprimarily theoretical in nature. Finally, the concluding section\nintroduces the hypothesis that core structural and other features of\nfolk psychological competence are best understood and explained by\nthinking of that competence as being rooted in special kinds of\nnarrative practice as opposed to being grounded in theory.\n",
