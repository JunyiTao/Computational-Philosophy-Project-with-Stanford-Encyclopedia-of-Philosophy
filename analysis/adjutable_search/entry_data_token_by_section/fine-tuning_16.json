    "main_text": "Fine-Tuning and the Multiverse || Independently Motivating and Testing the Multiverse Hypothesis?\n4.4 Independently Motivating and Testing the Multiverse Hypothesis?\n\nAs just outlined, it is controversial whether it is rational to infer\nthe existence of multiple universes from our universe\u2019s\nfine-tuning for life. However, if we had strong independent\nevidence for other universes with life-hostile conditions, attempts to\naccount for why our own universe is life-friendly would most likely\nseem futile. Thus independent evidence for some multiverse scenario\ncould have a strong impact on what we regard as a rational response to\nfine-tuning for life. Proponents of the argument from fine-tuning for\nthe multiverse could moreover welcome such evidence as potentially\nhelping to motivate a non-negligible prior \\(P(M)\\) for the\nmultiverse.\n\nMany physicists nowadays believe that a specific version of the\nmultiverse hypothesis is indeed suggested by contemporary developments\nin fundamental physics, notably by the combination of inflationary\ncosmology and string theory, both of which have been introduced in\n Section 2.3.\n According to many advocates of inflationary cosmology, the process of\ninflation results in causally isolated space-time regions, so-called\n\u201cisland universes\u201d. This process is in general\n\u201ceternal\u201d in that the formation of island universes never\nends. As a result, it leads to the production of a vast (and,\naccording to most models, infinite) \u201cmultiverse\u201d of island\nuniverses (Guth 2000).\n\nAs remarked in\n Section 2.3,\n string theory has an enormous number of lowest energy states (vacua),\nwhich would manifest themselves at the level of observations and\nexperiments in terms of different higher level physical laws and\nvalues of the constants. When combined with the idea of island\nuniverses as suggested by inflationary cosmology one obtains a\ncosmological picture in which there are infinitely many island\nuniverses where all the different string theory\nvacua\u2014corresponding to different higher-level physical laws and\nconstants in these laws\u2014are actually realized in the different\nisland universes. This so-called landscape multiverse\nqualifies as a concrete multiverse scenario in the sense of the\nargument from fine-tuning for the multiverse. A necessary condition is\nof course that the collection of island universes that are part of the\nlandscape multiverse includes, as is widely believed to be the case,\nat least one universe with the same effective (higher-level) laws and\nconstants as our own.\n\nUnfortunately, concrete multiverse scenarios such as the landscape\nmultiverse are extremely difficult to test, precisely because they\nentail that different universes exhibit very different conditions. The\nbroad consensus in the literature on multiverse cosmology is that, in\norder for a multiverse scenario to qualify as empirically confirmed,\nit must entail that those conditions that we find in our own universe\nare typical among those found by observers across the\nmultiverse. Widely used formulations of typicality are\nVilenkin\u2019s principle of mediocrity (Vilenkin 1995) and\nBostrom\u2019s self-sampling assumption (Bostrom 2002).\nTypicality principles can be regarded as refinements of the anthropic\nprinciples (Bostrom 2002) in the form of indifference principles\nof self-locating belief (Elga 2004): inasmuch as we are ignorant\nabout who and where among observers we are, they recommend to reason\nas if we were equally likely to be any of the observers who we\nmight possibly be, given our empirical evidence.\n\nTypicality principles have the benefit of making multiverse theories\nat least in principle testable (Aguirre 2007; Barnes 2017). They are\ncontroversial, however, because it is contested whether typicality is\nalways a reasonable assumption (Hartle & Srednicki 2007; Smolin\n2007) and because it is difficult to specify with respect to which\nreference class of observers typicality should be assumed. In\npractice, observer proxies are chosen such as share of baryon matter\nclustered in large galaxies (Martel et al. 1998) or entropy gradient\n(Bousso et al. 2007). These difficulties are exacerbated in\ncosmological scenarios such as the landscape multiverse in which\nreference classes of observers that one might reasonably choose are\nall infinite. The problem of regularizing those infinities corresponds\nto the so-called measure problem of cosmology, according to\nsome cosmologists \u201cthe greatest crisis in physics today\u201d\n(Tegmark 2014: 314). (See Schellekens [2013: sect. VI.B] for an\nintroduction to the measure problem aimed at physicists, Smeenk [2014]\nfor a philosopher\u2019s sceptical assessment of its solvability, and\nDorr & Arntzenius [2017] for a more optimistic perspective.)\nFriederich (2021: ch. 8) argues that the freedom to choose, for\nexample, an observer proxy and a cosmic measure makes typicality-based\npredictions from multiverse theories untrustworthy and susceptible to\nconfirmation bias.\n\nThe persisting difficulties with testing multiverse theories are a\nprime reason why the multiverse idea itself continues to be viewed\nvery critically by many leading physicists (e.g., Ellis 2011).\n",
