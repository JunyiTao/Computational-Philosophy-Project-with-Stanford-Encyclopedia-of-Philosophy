    "main_text": "\n\nCommunitarianism is the idea that human identities are largely shaped\nby different kinds of constitutive communities (or social relations)\nand that this conception of human nature should inform our moral and\npolitical judgments as well as policies and institutions. We live\nmost of our lives in communities, similar to lions who live in social\ngroups rather than individualistic tigers who live alone most of the\ntime. Those communities shape, and ought to shape, our moral and\npolitical judgments and we have a strong obligation to support and\nnourish the particular communities that provide meaning for our lives,\nwithout which we\u2019d be disoriented, deeply lonely, and incapable of\ninformed moral and political judgment.\n\nCommunitarian ideas have a long history, in the West, China, and\nelsewhere, but modern-day communitarianism began in the upper reaches\nof Anglo-American academia in the form of a critical reaction to John\nRawls\u2019 landmark 1971 book A Theory of Justice (Rawls\n1971). Drawing primarily upon the insights of Aristotle and Hegel,\npolitical philosophers such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Michael Sandel,\nCharles Taylor and Michael Walzer disputed Rawls\u2019 assumption\nthat the principal task of government is to secure and distribute\nfairly the liberties and economic resources individuals need to lead\nfreely chosen lives. These critics of liberal theory never did\nidentify themselves with the communitarian movement (the communitarian\nlabel was pinned on them by others, usually\ncritics),[1]\nmuch less offer a grand communitarian theory as a systematic\nalternative to liberalism. Nonetheless, certain core arguments meant\nto contrast with liberalism\u2019s devaluation of community recur in\nthe works of the four theorists named above (Avineri & de-Shalit\n1992, Bell 1993, Berten et al. 1997, Mulhall & Swift\n1996, and Rasmussen 1990), and for purposes of clarity one can\ndistinguish between claims of three sorts: methodological claims about\nthe importance of tradition and social context for moral and political\nreasoning, ontological or metaphysical claims about the social nature\nof the self, and normative claims about the value of\ncommunity.[2]\n\nThis essay is therefore divided in three parts, and for each part I\npresent the main communitarian claims, followed by an argument (in\neach part) that philosophical concerns in the 1980s have largely given\nway to the political concerns that motivated much of the communitarian\ncritique in the first place.\n",
