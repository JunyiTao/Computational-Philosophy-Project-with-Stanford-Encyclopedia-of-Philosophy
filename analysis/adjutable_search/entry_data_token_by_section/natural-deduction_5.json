    "main_text": "Natural Deduction and Quantifiers || Quantifier Basics\n3.1 Quantifier Basics\n\nThinking of a universal quantification as (sort of) a conjunction with\none conjunct for each element in the domain quantified over, we\nnaturally get a rule of\n\n\\(\\forall\\)-E:\nan arbitrary instance, \\(A(t)\\), may be inferred from a universal\nquantification, \\(\\forall\n x(A(x))\\).[15]\n\n\nThe corresponding introduction rule is less obvious: the domain might\nbe infinite, and only finitely many conjuncts can occur in a formal\nproof! We proceed more circuitously. First, we assume an\n\u201calphabet\u201d of special terms (variously called free\nvariables, parameters, dummy constants,\u2026). Next, we define\na special sort of subproof, the subproof general with respect\nto a particular term from this alphabet: in Fitch\u2019s\nnotation, these subproofs are marked with an occurrence of the\nrelevant term beside the top of its vertical line. These subproofs are\nsubject to a restriction on reiteration: a formula containing a\nparticular one of the special terms cannot be reiterated into a\nsubproof general with respect to that term. Then we may state the\nrule\n\n\\(\\forall\\)-I:\na universal quantification, \\(\\forall x(A(x))\\), may be asserted\nafter a subproof, general with respect to a special term, \\(a\\),\nhaving no hypothesis, containing the instance of the quantification\nfor that term,\n \\(A(a)\\).[16]\n\n\nThe soundness of such a rule is easy to see. The restriction on\nreiteration into general subproofs means that no special assumptions\non the term \\(a\\) can be smuggled into a subproof general with respect\nto \\(a\\). The subproof, therefore, can be seen as displaying a schema\nby which (pretending for the moment that every element in the domain\nhas a\n name[17])\n proofs could be constructed of an instance of the quantification for\neach element.\n\nThe standard rules for the existential quantifier are similar\nanalogical extensions of the disjunction rules. The introduction rule\nis easy:\n\n\\(\\exists\\)-I:\nan existential quantification, \\(\\exists x(A(x))\\), may be\ninferred from any of its instances, \\(A(t)\\).\n\n\nThe rule of \\(\\lor\\)-E allows us to infer a conclusion from a\ndisjunction given subproofs showing how the conclusion can be deduced\non the assumption of any of the disjuncts. Using a general subproof,\nas before, to present a schema for the deduction of the conclusion\nfrom an arbitrary \u201cdisjunct\u201d, we have\n\n\\(\\exists\\)-E:\na conclusion, \\(C\\), may be asserted after an existential\nquantification, \\(\\exists x(A(x))\\), and a subproof, general with\nrespect to a term, \\(a\\) (where \\(a\\) does not occur in \\(C\\)), having\nthe instance \\(A(a)\\) as its hypothesis and containing \\(C\\) as a\nline.\n\n\nAgain, pretending for the moment that every element of the domain has\na name, the soundness of these rules is evident. (An instructive\nexercise, given the negation rules for classical logic, is to show\nthat the rules for \\(\\exists\\) (for \\(\\forall\\)) are derivable from\nthe rules for \\(\\forall\\) (for \\(\\exists\\)) and the definition of\n\\(\\exists x(A(x))\\) as \\(\\neg\\forall x\\neg(A(x))\\) (the definition of\n\\(\\forall x(A(x))\\) as \\(\\neg\\exists x\\neg(A(x))\\)). The restriction\nthat the special term of the subproof not occur in the conclusion of\n\\(\\exists\\)-Elimination turns out to correspond exactly to the\nrestriction on reiteration into general subproofs.)\n\nA few remarks about these rules are in order. One is that, since only\nfinitely many terms can occur in the finite section of a proof\npreceding a given application of a rule, we could require that the\nspecial term, \\(a\\), used in an application of \\(\\forall\\)-I or\n\\(\\exists\\)-E should not occur in the hypothesis of any of the\nsubproofs containing the rule application (or in any premiss of the\nwhole proof): in the terminology used in discussing Gentzen\u2019s\ntree-like formulation of natural deduction, \\(a\\) cannot occur in a\nhypothesis above the rule application unless that hypothesis has\nalready been discharged by some earlier application of a rule of\nsupposition. This would slightly simplify the overall framework by\nrendering unnecessary the restriction on reiteration into general\nsubproofs. On the other hand, in constructing a very long formalized\nproof, it is convenient to allow ourselves to re-use special terms. If\nwe did do without the restriction on reiteration, we could reformulate\n\\(\\forall\\)-Introduction without mentioning a special subproof. We\ncould just say that \\(\\forall x(A(x))\\) may be asserted after\n\\(A(a)\\), provided that \\(a\\) does not occur in earlier hypotheses\nthat have not been discharged (many popular undergraduate textbooks\nadopt this course). This would simplify the statement of the rules a\nbit (though not the process of constructing proofs: checking that\n\\(a\\) doesn\u2019t occur in \u201cprohibited\u201d hypotheses will\nbe time-consuming in constructing a long proof). On the other hand, it\nwould obscure the relationship between the \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\)\nrules.\n\nThere is another oddity about the \\(\\forall\\)-I rule. We initially\nintroduced the idea of a subproof as representing suppositional\nreasoning: a subproof is a deduction from a hypothesis. But in\n\\(\\forall\\)-I we use a subproof that doesn\u2019t have a hypothesis!\nIf this seems objectionably odd, we could say that the subproof of an\napplication of \\(\\forall\\)-I, does have a hypothesis, but an unstated,\nmetalinguistic, one: the supposition is that the (otherwise\nuninterpreted) term \\(a\\) stands for some element in the domain. This\nis not as arbitrary as it might seem: if we modify the rules to give\nuniversally free logic (see Nolt 2020)\u2014that is, quantificational\nlogic freed from the assumptions made in ordinary first order logic\nthat the domain is non-empty and that all singular terms denote\nelements of it\u2014this hypothesis comes into the object language\nand is explicitly stated. Free logic is most easily formulated with an\nexistence predicate, \\(E!\\), and the rule becomes\n\nFree \\(\\forall\\)-I:\na universal quantification, \\(\\forall x(A(x))\\), may be asserted\nafter a subproof, general with respect to a special term, \\(a\\),\nhaving \\(E!(a)\\) as its hypothesis, containing the instance of the\nquantification, \\(A(a)\\) as a line.\n\n\nExistence hypotheses and premises get added to the other quantifier\nrules: \\(\\forall\\)-E and \\(\\exists\\)-I become two-premiss rules, with\n\\(E!(t)\\) as the second premiss, and the subproof for \\(\\exists\\)-E\nends up with two hypotheses, \\(A(a)\\) and \\(E!(a)\\). Formulations of\nmany-sorted quantificational logics (Hailperin 1957, 1960 for a\nclassic statement; Freund 2019 for a philosophical application) can\nfollow the same pattern, with the extra hypotheses and premisses\nsaying that the relevant term or parameter stands for something in the\nrange of a particular sort of variable.\n",
