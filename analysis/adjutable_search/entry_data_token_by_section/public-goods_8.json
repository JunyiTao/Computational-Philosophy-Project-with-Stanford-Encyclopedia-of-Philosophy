    "main_text": "The Private Provision of Public Goods || Coupling\n4.1 Coupling\n\nMancur Olson was among the first economists who studied the private\nprovision of public goods in great detail (Olson 1971). He argued that\nthe existence of a common purpose or common interests is\ncharacteristic of organisations. But if these interests are\nserved, that means that a public good has been created. Therefore:\n\n\nIt is of the essence of an organization that it provides an\ninseparable, generalized benefit. It follows that the provision of\npublic or collective goods is the fundamental function of\norganizations generally. (Olson 1971: 15)\n\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that organisations cannot also produce\nprivate goods:\n\n\nThere is no suggestion here that states or other organizations provide\nonly public or collective goods. Governments often provide\nnoncollective goods like electric power, for example, and they usually\nsell such goods on the market much as private firms would do.\nMoreover, as later parts of this study will argue, large organizations\nthat are not able to make membership compulsory must also\nprovide some noncollective goods in order to give potential members an\nincentive to join. (Olson 1971: 16; emphasis in original)\n\n\nThe coupling of private and public goods is one important mechanism\nthrough which private enterprises can be enabled to provide public\ngoods. In the eighteenth century, lighthouses were public good because\ntheir \u201cconsumption\u201d was non-rivalrous (barring congestion)\nand non-excludable (using the technology available then). Port spaces\nare private goods, however. British lighthouses were often financed by\nimposing light dues on ship owners at the ports (Coase 1974). The dues\nwere calculated by the net ton per voyage for all ships arriving at,\nor departing from, ports in Britain. A public good that is coupled\nwith a private good as a mechanism for its financing is called an\n\u201cimpure\u201d public good (Cornes & Sandler 1984).\n\nShopping centres and some apartment buildings provide other examples\nof impure public goods. Shopping malls provide public spaces, streets,\nparking space, and security for which consumers pay indirectly by\nbuying the merchandise offered in the shopping centre. Similarly, some\napartment buildings offer common spaces and infrastructure for which\nowners pay through supplements to the apartment prices or rentals.\n\nThe shopping centre example illustrates a potential problem for the\nprivate provision of a public good. Suppose that it is prohibitively\nexpensive to charge individuals for the use of parking spaces\nprovided. Parking space is then a public good because non-shoppers can\nuse it free of charge. Suppose further that the owner of land nearby\nexploits the situation by building a competing shopping centre that\ndoes not offer parking space. The new shopping centre can price its\ncompetitor out of the market by offering lower prices for the\nmerchandise it sells because it does not have to pay for parking\nspace.\n\nHowever, at least in principle the owner of the first shopping centre\ncan avoid this by purchasing the surrounding land before free parking\nis allowed. After Ronald Coase this mechanism for solving\nexternalities problems is referred to as \u201cextending the role of\nthe firm\u201d (see Demsetz 1964). Another example for this mechanism\ninvolves the public good pollination. If a bee keeper and the owner of\nan orchard cannot agree on the value of the pollination and nectar,\neither is free to buy the other\u2019s property and thus internalise\nthe externality by extending the firm.\n",
