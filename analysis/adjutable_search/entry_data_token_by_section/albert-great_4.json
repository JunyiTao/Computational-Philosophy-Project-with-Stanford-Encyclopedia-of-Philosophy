    "main_text": "Psychology and Anthropology\n5. Psychology and Anthropology\n\n\nAlbert\u2019s interest in the human condition is dominated by his\nconcern with the relationship of the soul to the body on the one hand\nand the important role that the intellect plays in human psychology.\n According to Albert, man is identified with his\n intellect.[8]\n With regard to the relationship between the soul and the body Albert\nappears to be torn between the Platonic theory which sees the soul as\na form capable of existing independently of the body and the\nAristotelian hylomorphic theory which reduces the soul to a functional\nrelationship of the body. With respect to human knowing, for example,\nhe maintains the position that the human intellect is dependent upon\n the\n senses.[9]\n In order to resolve the conflict between the two views Albert availed\nhimself of Avicenna\u2019s position that Aristotle\u2019s analysis\nwas focused on the function and not the essence of the\nsoul. Functionally, Albert argues, the soul is the agent cause of the\nbody. \u201cJust as we maintain that the soul is the cause of the\nanimated body and of its motions and passions insofar as it is\nanimated,\u201d he reasons, \u201clikewise we must maintain that the\nlowest intelligence is the cause of the cognitive soul insofar as it\nis cognitive because the cognition of the soul is a particular result\n of the light of the\n intelligence.\u201d[10]\n Having been created in the image and likeness of God it not only\ngoverns the body, as God governs the universe, but it is responsible\nfor the very existence of the body, as God is the creator of the\nworld. And just as God transcends his creation, so does the human soul\ntranscend the body in its interests. It is capable of operating in\ncomplete independence of corporeal functions. This transcendental\nfunction of the soul allows Albert to focus on what he believes is the\nessence of the soul\u2014the human intellect.\n\n\nViewed as essentially an intellect, the human soul is an incorporeal\nsubstance. Albert divides this spiritual substance into two\n powers\u2014the agent intellect and the possible\n intellect.[11]\n Neither of these powers needs the body in order to function. Under\ncertain conditions concerning its powers the human intellect is\ncapable of transformation. While it is true that under the stimulus or\nillumination of the agent intellect the possible intellect can\nconsider the intelligible form of the phantasms of the mind which are\nderived from the senses, it can also operate under the sole influence\nof the agent intellect. Here, Albert argues, the possible intellect\nundergoes a complete transformation and becomes totally actualized, as\nthe agent intellect becomes its form. It emerges as what he calls the\n\u201cadept intellect\u201d (intellectus\n adeptus).[12]\n At this stage the human intellect is susceptible to illumination by\nhigher cosmic intellects called the \u201cintelligences\u201d. Such\nillumination brings the soul of man into complete harmony with the\nentire order of creation and constitutes man\u2019s natural\nhappiness. Since the intellect is now totally assimilated to the order\nof things Albert calls the intellect in its final stage of development\nthe \u201cassimilated intellect\u201d (intellectus\nassimilativus). The condition of having attained an assimilated\nintellect constitutes natural human happiness, realizing all the\naspirations of the human condition and human culture. But Albert makes\nit clear that the human mind cannot attain this state of assimilation\non its own. Following the Augustinian tradition as set forth in the\nDe magistro Albert states that \u201cbecause the divine\ntruth lies beyond our reason we are not able by ourselves to discover\nit, unless it condescends to infuse itself; for as Augustine says, it\nis an inner teacher, without whom an external teacher labors\n aimlessly.\u201d[13]\n There is thus an infusion involved with divine illumination, but it\nis not a pouring forth of forms. Rather, it is an infusion of an inner\nteacher, who is identified with divine truth itself. In his commentary\non the Sentences Albert augments this doctrine when he argues\nthat this inner teacher strengthens the weakness of the human\nintellect, which by itself could not profit by external\nstimulation. He distinguishes the illumination of this interior\nteacher from the true and final object of the\n intellect.[14]\n Divine light is only a means by which the intellect can attain its\n object.[15]\n This is consistent with his emphasis upon the analogy of divine light\nand physical light, which pervades so much of his thinking. It\nfollows, then, that in the order of human knowing there are first of\nall the forms that are derived from external things. They cannot teach\nus anything in any useful way until the light of an inner teacher\nilluminates them. So light is the medium of this vision. But the inner\nteacher himself is identified with the divine truth, which is the\nfinal object and perfection of the human intellect. In his\nSumma, however, Albert makes further distinctions concerning\nthe object of human knowing. Natural things, he tells us, are received\nin a natural light, while the things that the intellect contemplates\nin the order of belief (ad credenda vero) are received in a\nlight that is gratuitous (gratuitum est), and the beatifying\nrealities are received in the light of\n glory.[16]\n It seems that Albert has abandoned the position that even\nnaturalia require divine illumination. Strictly speaking, he\nhas not abnegated his earlier position. Naturalia may very\nwell still require the work of a restorative inner teacher. In the\nSumma, however, Albert is anxious to stress the radical\ndifference natural knowing has from supernatural knowing. He has\nalready established this difference in his study of the human\nintellect (De intellectu) where he tells us, \u201cSome\n[intelligibles] with their light overpower our intellect which is\ntemporal and has continuity. These are like the things that are most\nmanifest in nature which are related to our intellect as the light of\nthe sun or a strong scintillating color is to the eyes of the bat or\nthe owl. Other [intelligibles] are manifest only through the light of\nanother. These would be like the things which are received in faith\nfrom what is primary and\n true.\u201d[17]\n But in both natural and supernatural knowing Albert is careful to\nstress the final object and perfection of the human intellect. This\nleads naturally to a consideration of Albert\u2019s understanding of\nethics.\n",
