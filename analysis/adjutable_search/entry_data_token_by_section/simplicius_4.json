The Commentary as Spiritual Exercise\n\n\nI offer these things as a hymn to You, Lord (despota),\nCreator (d\u00eamiourgos) of the whole cosmos and of the\nsimple bodies in it, and to those who have been made by You, desiring\nto behold the greatness of Your works and proclaim it to the worthy so\nthat, thinking nothing mean or merely human about You, we might kneel\ndown to You because of the superiority which You have over all the\nthings created by You. (Simplicius, In Cael. 731.25\u201329,\ntranslated by I. Mueller)\n\n\nSimplicius\u2019 Commentary on the Heavens ends with a\nprayer to the demiurge. In this prayer, the whole work is termed a\n\u201chymn\u201d (humnos) to the creator god. Several\nrecent studies have pointed out that the later Neoplatonists\nconsidered theology and ritual (theurgy) an integral part of their\nphilosophy. For instance, Proclus composed several hymns and begins\nhis Commentary on the Parmenides with a long prayer. Both he\nand his teacher Syrianus were eager to show that Plato was in harmony\nwith most ancient religious traditions such as the Orphics, the\nPythagoreans and the Chaldaean Oracles. Simplicius\u2019 extant\ncommentaries all end with a prayer, the only exception being the\nCommentary on the De anima, where we find a small prayer at\nthe beginning of the work:\n\n\nAnd now, under the Guide who is the cause of all souls and all\nreasoning, let us start upon the projected work. (Simplicius, In\nde Anima 1.3\u201321, translated by J. O. Urmson, slightly\nmodified)\n\n\nSurprisingly, and unexpectedly for readers familiar with\nAristotle\u2019s Physics and De caelo, which are\nboth rather technical in character, Simplicius\u2019 comments time\nand again betray a deeply religious or spiritual mindset. In the\ntradition of Athenian Neoplatonism, where religious and ritual\nelements were crucial ingredients of philosophy, Simplicius\u2019\nPlatonisation of Aristotle, as it were, also entails a\nspiritualisation of Aristotle\u2019s works.\n\nThis is where the ultimate usefulness (chr\u00easimon) of\nSimplicius\u2019 writings is located. Philippe Hoffmann has\ndemonstrated this admirably:\n\n\nThe example of Simplicius\u2019s Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics is emblematic of the connection between learned exegesis\nand religion: the \u201cusefulness\u201d of physics, Simplicius\nexplains, is to provoke the awakening in souls of the anagogical triad\nof Love, Truth, and Faith (to which is added a fourth term, Hope); and\nthe successive reading of the Physics and the De\nCaelo leads the soul of the philosopher-exegete and those of his\naudience (or of his readers) to a \u201cunion\u201d\n(hen\u00f4sis), through Faith and the \u201cvital\nsympathy\u201d correlative with it, with the divine Heaven and with\nthe demiurgic intellect that produces the World. (Hoffmann 2006:\n599\u2013600)\n\n\nWithin this text is a motif that may be called the ultimate goal\n(telos) of all ancient philosophical schools, but especially\nof the Platonic tradition, to wit, \u201cassimilation to god\u201d (Plato, Theaetetus 176b\u2013c, trans. by author).\nThe average Aristotle\nscholar today might find this far-fetched, to say the least. However,\nneither of Simplicius\u2019 commentaries on natural philosophy was by\nany means a religious manifesto. Rather, they are both crammed with\ntechnical details and a vast knowledge of texts and philosophical\nproblems. But to ignore this religious dimension would do injustice to\nSimplicius\u2019 general approach to philosophy and exegesis, for in\nlate Antiquity, philosophy was considered a \u201cway of life\u201d\n(P. Hadot 1995) and always related\nto ethics and the ultimate goal of human life, i.e., purification,\nascent, and salvation/deification of the soul:\n\n\nIf we take Simplicius at his word that the \u2018study of physics\n[\u2026] arouses us to marvel and magnify the maker of the cosmos',\nhis commentaries on Physics and On the Heavens are\nindeed also a form of worship in which his ingenuity and respect for\nthe established tradition contribute to the general effort of\nclarifying the interpreters of nature (and the interpreters of the\ninterpreters). In trying to defend the Platonist point of view in\ncontradistinction to the Christian outlook he uses polemic to persuade\nand refute, the comprehensive exegesis to clarify and proselytise. His\ncommentaries thus became one very elaborate protreptic and guide to\nAristotle's works. (Baltussen 2008: 195)\n\n",
