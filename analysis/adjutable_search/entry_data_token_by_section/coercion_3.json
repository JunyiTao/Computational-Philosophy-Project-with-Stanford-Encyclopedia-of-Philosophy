    "main_text": "History || John Stuart Mill\n1.3 John Stuart Mill\n\nWith respect to his thinking about coercion, Mill is most famous for\nhis views, in On Liberty, about what coercion is not fit to\ndo: namely, be used to regulate people\u2019s behavior for their own\ngood. Like his predecessors and mentor Jeremy Bentham, Mill associates\ncoercion with the state\u2019s powers to punish lawbreakers. But Mill\nseems in general to take a more expansive view of what coercion\namounts to than did those surveyed above, appearing to treat the terms\n\u201ccoercion\u201d and \u201cinterference\u201d as much the same\nthing in On Liberty. In stating the thesis of that work, Mill\nwrites,\n\nThe object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as\nentitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the\nindividual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means\nused be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral\ncoercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for\nwhich mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in\ninterfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is\nself-protection. \u2026 [An individual] cannot rightfully be\ncompelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so,\nbecause it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others,\nto do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for\nremonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or\nentreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any\nevil in case he do otherwise (Mill 1909\u201314 [1859], Ch.1).\n\n\nIn treating coercion expansively, Mill apparently intended to capture\na number of different ways in which powerful agents could exercise\nconstraining power on others besides the use of force, violence, and\nthreats thereof. So, for instance, Mill suggests that the potency of\nlegal penalties often resides more in the stigma they attach than the\nactual punishments they apply. Concerning laws against unpopular\nviews, Mill writes,\n\n[T]he chief mischief of the legal penalties is that they strengthen\nthe social stigma. It is that stigma which is really effective\u2026\n[Except for people who are] independent of the good will of other\npeople, opinion, on this subject, is as efficacious as law; men might\nas well be imprisoned, as excluded from the means of earning their\nbread.\u2026 Our merely social intolerance kills no one, roots out\nno opinions, but induces men to disguise them, or to abstain from any\nactive effort for their diffusion (Mill 1909\u201314 [1859], Ch. 2).\n\n\nThus Mill decries \u201cthe despotism of custom,\u201d as a force\nseemingly more potent than that of governments, in that it is able to\nhold back whole civilizations for centuries (Mill 1909\u201314\n[1859], Ch. 2).\n\nBy contrast with Hobbes, Locke, or Kant, Mill recognizes that the\npower of civil institutions is frequently on a par with the power of\nthe state, and treats the potential for coercion by these other\ninstitutions as similarly a matter of concern. For instance, in\nthinking about the institution of marriage, Mill writes,\n\nWhen the law makes everything which the wife acquires, the property of\nthe husband, while by compelling her to live with him it forces her to\nsubmit to almost any amount of moral and even physical tyranny which\nhe may choose to inflict, there is some ground for regarding every act\ndone by her as done under coercion (Mill 1909 [1848], Bk.V, ch. XI).\n\n\nAnd in looking at the circumstances of child labor in his day, he\nnoted,\n\nLabouring for too many hours in the day, or on work beyond their\nstrength, should not be permitted to [children], for if permitted it\nmay always be compelled. Freedom of contract, in the case of children,\nis but another word for freedom of coercion (Mill 1909 [1848], Bk. V.\nch. XI).\n\n\nThus Mill\u2019s understanding of coercion appears to treat a wider\narray of powers as potential means of coercion than did earlier\nthinkers.\n",
