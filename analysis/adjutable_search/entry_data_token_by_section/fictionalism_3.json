    "main_text": "Some Qualifications and Distinctions || Hermeneutic and revolutionary fictionalism\n2.2 Hermeneutic and revolutionary fictionalism\n\nA second distinction is between hermeneutic and\nrevolutionary\n fictionalism.[1]\n Hermeneutic fictionalism about a discourse D is a thesis\nabout the actual nature of the discourse: according to hermeneutic\nfictionalism we actually do not aim at the literal truth but only\nappear or pretend to do so. Revolutionary fictionalism, by contrast,\ninsists that when engaging in D we ought only to\nmake such pretend-assertions; the point of engaging in D\nwould be achieved by pretend-assertions. Obviously, hermeneutic and\nrevolutionary fictionalism are different theses and must be evaluated\nseparately. In the rest of the discussion in section 2, I will focus\nprimarily on hermeneutic fictionalism. I trust that it will be\nstraightforward to see how the points generalize to revolutionary\nfictionalism.\n",
