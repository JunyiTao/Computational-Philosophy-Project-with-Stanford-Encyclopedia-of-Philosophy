    "main_text": "The Contemporary Republican Program || Republicanism Across Borders\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn many respects, civic republicanism remains a still underdeveloped\npolitical doctrine. Further work is required in all the areas\ndiscussed above, and there are many issues central to the concerns of\ncontemporary political theorists and philosophers that contemporary\ncivic republicans have only recently begun to examine. Among the\nlatter, there are now at least initial treatments of multiculturalism\n(Laborde 2008; Lovett 2010; Honohan 2013; Bachvarova 2014), education\npolicy (Peterson 2011; Hinchliffe 2014; Macleod 2015), and\nintergenerational justice (Beckman 2016; Katz 2017; Pinto 2019),\nalthough substantial work certainly remains to be done. Nevertheless,\ncivic republicanism is a dynamic and growing field, which stands to\nmake continuing positive contributions to debate in contemporary\nsocial and political theory.\n",
