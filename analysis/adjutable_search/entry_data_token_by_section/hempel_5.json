    "main_text": "Scientific Reasoning\n3. Scientific Reasoning\n\nThe need to dismantle the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness\ntogether with the demise of the observational/theoretical distinction\nmeant that logical positivism no longer represented a rationally\ndefensible position. At least two of its defining tenets had been\nshown to be without merit. Since most philosophers believed that Quine\nhad shown the analytic/synthetic distinction was also untenable,\nmoreover, many concluded that the enterprise had been a total failure.\nAmong the important benefits of Hempel\u2019s critique, however, was\nthe production of more general and flexible criteria of cognitive\nsignificance in Hempel (1965b), included in a famous collection of his\nstudies, Aspects of Scientific Explanation (1965d). There he\nproposed that cognitive significance could not be adequately captured\nby means of principles of verification or falsification, whose defects\nwere parallel, but instead required a far more subtle and nuanced\napproach.\n\nHempel suggested multiple criteria for assessing the cognitive\nsignificance of different theoretical systems, where significance is\nnot categorical but rather a matter of degree:\n\nSignificant systems range from those whose entire extralogical\nvocabulary consists of observation terms, through theories whose\nformulation relies heavily on theoretical constructs, on to systems\nwith hardly any bearing on potential empirical findings. (Hempel\n1965b: 117, italics added)\n\n\nThe criteria Hempel offered for evaluating the \u201cdegrees of\nsignificance\u201d of theoretical systems (as conjunctions of\nhypotheses, definitions, and auxiliary claims) were (a) the clarity\nand precision with which they are formulated, including explicit\nconnections to observational language; (b) the\nsystematic\u2014explanatory and predictive\u2014power of such a\nsystem, in relation to observable phenomena; (c) the formal simplicity\nof the systems with which a certain degree of systematic power is\nattained; and (d) the extent to which those systems have been\nconfirmed by experimental evidence (Hempel 1965b). The elegance of\nHempel\u2019s study laid to rest any lingering aspirations for simple\ncriteria of cognitive significance and signaled the demise of logical\npositivism as a philosophical movement.\n\nPrecisely what remained, however, was in doubt. Presumably, anyone who\nrejected one or more of the three principles defining\npositivism\u2014the analytic/synthetic distinction, the\nobservational/theoretical distinction, and the verifiability criterion\nof significance\u2014was not a logical positivist. The precise\noutlines of its philosophical successor, which would be known as\n\u201clogical empiricism\u201d, were not entirely evident. Perhaps\nthis study came the closest to defining its intellectual core. Those\nwho accepted Hempel\u2019s four criteria and viewed cognitive\nsignificance as a matter of degree were members, at least in spirit.\nBut some new problems were beginning to surface with respect to\nHempel\u2019s covering-law explication of explanation and old\nproblems remained from his studies of induction, the most remarkable\nof which was known as \u201cthe paradox of confirmation\u201d.\n",
