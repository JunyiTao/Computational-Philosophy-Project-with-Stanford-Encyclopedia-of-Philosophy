    "main_text": "Two More Paradoxes || The Grain of Millet\n4.2 The Grain of Millet\n\n\u2026 Zeno\u2019s reasoning is false when he argues that there is\nno part of the millet that does not make a sound; for there is no\nreason why any part should not in any length of time fail to move the\nair that the whole bushel moves in falling. (Aristotle\nPhysics, 250a19)\n\n\nIn context, Aristotle is explaining that a fraction of a force many\nnot produce the same fraction of motion. For instance, while 100\nstevedores can tow a barge, one might not get it to move at all, let\nalone 1/100th of the speed; so given as much time as you like he may\nnot move it as far as the 100. (We describe this fact as the effect of\nfriction.) Similarly, just because a falling bushel of millet makes a\nwhooshing sound as it falls, it does not follow that each individual\ngrain would, or does: given as much time as you like it won\u2019t move the\nsame amount of air as the bushel does. However, while refuting this\npremise Aristotle does not explain what role it played for Zeno, and\nwe can only speculate. It\u2019s not even clear whether it is part of a\nparadox, or some other dispute: did Zeno also claim to show that a\nsingle grain of millet does not make a sound? One speculation\nis that our senses reveal that it does not, since we cannot hear a\nsingle grain falling. Then Aristotle\u2019s response is apt; and so is the\nsimilar response that hearing itself requires movement in the air\nabove a certain threshold.\n\n",
