    "main_text": "The Linguistic Argument\n4. The Linguistic Argument\n\nIntellectualism has been motivated on the basis of a linguistic\nargument concerning knowledge-how ascriptions in English (Vendler\n1972; Stanley & Williamson 2001; Snowdon 2004; Stanley 2011b,\n2011c). Begin by noticing that (1) is remarkably similar to\n(2)\u2013(3) (\u201cfinite knowledge wh ascriptions\u201d as they\nembed a complement with a finitival verb) and to (4)\u2013(5)\n(\u201cinfinitive knowledge-wh ascriptions\u201d as they embed a\ncomplement with an infinitival verb):\n\n(1)\n Marie knows how to play the piano\n(2) \n Mary knows where her piano is located in the house.\n(3) \n Mary knows who can play her piano.\n(4) \n Mary knows what to do in case of an emergency.\n(5) \n Mary knows where to find an Italian newspaper.\n\n\nAccording to the standard syntactic analysis, (2)\u2013(5) have an\ninterrogative as complement\u2014\u201cwhere is her piano located in\nthe house?\u201d, \u201cwho can play the piano?\u201d, \u201cwhat\nto do in case of an emergency?\u201d are all interrogatives. Having\nsaid this, in broad outline, the linguistic argument for\nintellectualism has three steps. The first step is to follow the\nsyntactic cues from (1)\u2013(5) and identify the logical form of\n\u201cS knows how to \u03a6\u201d with that of \u201cS\nknows + interrogative Q (= \u201chow to \u03a6\u201d). Call\nthis premise Logical Form. The second step is to\naccept the orthodox semantics of knowledge-wh ascriptions, according\nto which in \u201cS knows + interrogative Q\u201d,\nQ denotes a question (C. Baker 1968) and according to which\n\u201cS knows + Q\u201d is true just in case S\nknows a proposition answering to the question expressed by Q.\nCall this premise Semantics for Knowledge-Wh (cf.,\namong many others, Hamblin 1958, 1973; Hintikka 1976; Karttunen 1977;\nHeim 1994; Groenendijk & Stokhof 1982, 1997; and Higginbotham\n1996). Finally, the third step is to extend this semantics to\nknowledge-how ascriptions, such that knowing how to \u03a6 requires\nknowing a proposition that answers the question \u201chow can one\n\u03a6?\u201d \n\nNext section (4.1) looks in some more detail to the intellectualist\nanalysis of the truth conditions for knowledge-how ascriptions. The\nsection after next\n (4.2)\n discusses several objections to the linguistic argument.\n",
