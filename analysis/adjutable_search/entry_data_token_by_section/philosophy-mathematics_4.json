    "main_text": "Four schools || Formalism\n2.3 Formalism\n\nDavid Hilbert agreed with the intuitionists that there is a sense in\nwhich the natural numbers are basic in mathematics. But unlike the\nintuitionists, Hilbert did not take the natural numbers to be mental\nconstructions. Instead, he argued that the natural numbers can be\ntaken to be symbols. Symbols are strictly speaking abstract\nobjects. Nonetheless, it is essential to symbols that they can be\nembodied by concrete objects, so we may call them\nquasi-concrete objects (Parsons 2008, chapter 1). Perhaps\nphysical entities could play the role of the natural numbers. For\ninstance, we may take a concrete ink trace of the form | to be the\nnumber 0, a concretely realized ink trace || to be the number 1, and\nso on. Hilbert thought it doubtful at best that higher mathematics\ncould be directly interpreted in a similarly straightforward and\nperhaps even concrete manner.\n\nUnlike the intuitionists, Hilbert was not prepared to take a\nrevisionist stance toward the existing body of mathematical knowledge.\nInstead, he adopted an instrumentalist stance with respect to higher\nmathematics. He thought that higher mathematics is no more than a\nformal game. The statements of higher-order mathematics are\nuninterpreted strings of symbols. Proving such statements is no more\nthan a game in which symbols are manipulated according to fixed rules.\nThe point of the \u2018game of higher mathematics\u2019 consists, in\nHilbert\u2019s view, in proving statements of elementary arithmetic,\nwhich do have a direct interpretation (Hilbert 1925).\n\nHilbert thought that there can be no reasonable doubt about the\nsoundness of classical Peano Arithmetic \u2014 or at least about the\nsoundness of a subsystem of it that is called Primitive Recursive\nArithmetic (Tait 1981). And he thought that every arithmetical\nstatement that can be proved by making a detour through higher\nmathematics, can also be proved directly in Peano Arithmetic. In fact,\nhe strongly suspected that every problem of elementary\narithmetic can be decided from the axioms of Peano Arithmetic. Of\ncourse solving arithmetical problems in arithmetic is in some cases\npractically impossible. The history of mathematics has shown that\nmaking a \u201cdetour\u201d through higher mathematics can sometimes\nlead to a proof of an arithmetical statement that is much shorter and\nthat provides more insight than any purely arithmetical proof of the\nsame statement.\n\nHilbert realized, albeit somewhat dimly, that some of his convictions\ncan actually be considered to be mathematical conjectures. For a proof\nin a formal system of higher mathematics or of elementary arithmetic\nis a finite combinatorial object which can, modulo coding, be\nconsidered to be a natural number. But in the 1920s the details of\ncoding proofs as natural numbers were not yet completely\nunderstood.\n\nOn the formalist view, a minimal requirement of formal systems of\nhigher mathematics is that they are at least consistent. Otherwise\nevery statement of elementary arithmetic can be proved in\nthem. Hilbert also saw (again, dimly) that the consistency of a system\nof higher mathematics entails that this system is at least partially\narithmetically sound. So Hilbert and his students set out to prove\nstatements such as the consistency of the standard postulates of\nmathematical analysis. Of course such statements would have to be\nproved in a \u2018safe\u2019 part of mathematics, such as elementary\narithmetic. Otherwise the proof does not increase our conviction in\nthe consistency of mathematical analysis. And, fortunately, it seemed\npossible in principle to do this, for in the final analysis\nconsistency statements are, again modulo coding, arithmetical\nstatements. So, to be precise, Hilbert and his students set out to\nprove the consistency of, e.g., the axioms of mathematical analysis in\nclassical Peano arithmetic. This project was known as\nHilbert\u2019s program (Zach 2006). It turned out to be more\ndifficult than they had expected. In fact, they did not even succeed\nin proving the consistency of the axioms of Peano Arithmetic in Peano\nArithmetic.\n\nThen Kurt G\u00f6del proved that there exist arithmetical statements\nthat are undecidable in Peano Arithmetic (G\u00f6del 1931). This has\nbecome known as his G\u00f6del\u2019s first incompleteness\ntheorem. This did not bode well for Hilbert\u2019s program, but\nit left open the possibility that the consistency of higher\nmathematics is not one of these undecidable statements. Unfortunately,\nG\u00f6del then quickly realized that, unless (God forbid!) Peano\nArithmetic is inconsistent, the consistency of Peano Arithmetic is\nindependent of Peano Arithmetic. This is G\u00f6del\u2019s second\nincompleteness theorem. G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness\ntheorems turn out to be generally applicable to all sufficiently\nstrong but consistent recursively axiomatizable theories. Together,\nthey entail that Hilbert\u2019s program fails. It turns out that\nhigher mathematics cannot be interpreted in a purely instrumental way.\nHigher mathematics can prove arithmetical sentences, such as\nconsistency statements, that are beyond the reach of Peano\nArithmetic.\n\nAll this does not spell the end of formalism. Even in the face of the\nincompleteness theorems, it is coherent to maintain that mathematics\nis the science of formal systems.\n\nOne version of this view was proposed by Curry (Curry 1958). On this\nview, mathematics consists of a collection of formal systems which\nhave no interpretation or subject matter. (Curry here makes an\nexception for metamathematics.) Relative to a formal system, one can\nsay that a statement is true if and only if it is derivable in the\nsystem. But on a fundamental level, all mathematical systems\nare on a par. There can be at most pragmatical reasons for preferring\none system over another. Inconsistent systems can prove all statements\nand therefore are pretty useless. So when a system is found to be\ninconsistent, it must be modified. It is simply a lesson from\nG\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems that a sufficiently strong\nconsistent system cannot prove its own consistency.\n\nThere is a canonical objection against Curry\u2019s formalist\nposition. Mathematicians do not in fact treat all apparently\nconsistent formal systems as being on a par. Most of them are\nunwilling to admit that the preference of arithmetical systems in\nwhich the arithmetical sentence expressing the consistency of Peano\nArithmetic are derivable over those in which its negation is\nderivable, for instance, can ultimately be explained in purely\npragmatical terms. Many mathematicians want to maintain that the\nperceived correctness (incorrectness) of certain formal systems must\nultimately be explained by the fact that they correctly (incorrectly)\ndescribe certain subject matters.\n\nDetlefsen has emphasized that the incompleteness theorems do not\npreclude that the consistency of parts of higher mathematics\nthat are in practice used for solving arithmetical problems that\nmathematicians are interested in can be arithmetically established\n(Detlefsen 1986). In this sense, something can perhaps be rescued from\nthe flames even if Hilbert\u2019s instrumentalist stance towards all\nof higher mathematics is ultimately untenable.\n\nAnother attempt to salvage a part of Hilbert\u2019s program was made\nby Isaacson (Isaacson 1987). He defends the view that in some\nsense, Peano Arithmetic may be complete after all (Isaacson\n1987). He argues that true sentences undecidable in Peano Arithmetic\ncan only be proved by means of higher-order concepts. For\ninstance, the consistency of Peano Arithmetic can be proved by\ninduction up to a transfinite ordinal number (Gentzen 1938). But the\nnotion of an ordinal number is a set-theoretic, and hence\nnon-arithmetical, concept. If the only ways of proving the consistency\nof arithmetic make essential use of notions which arguably belong to\nhigher-order mathematics, then the consistency of arithmetic, even\nthough it can be expressed in the language of Peano Arithmetic, is a\nnon-arithmetical problem. And generalizing from this, one can wonder\nwhether Hilbert\u2019s conjecture that every problem of\narithmetic can be decided from the axioms of Peano Arithmetic might\nnot still be true.\n",
