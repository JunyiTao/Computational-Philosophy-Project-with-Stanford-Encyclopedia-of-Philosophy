    "main_text": "The phenomenal intentionality theory || The general view\n2.1 The general view\n\nIntentionality is the \u201caboutness\u201d or \u201cdirectedness\u201dof mental\nstates. For example, a thought that snow is white \u201csays\u201d or represents that snow is white. Similarly, your\ncurrent visual experience might represent a blue cup or that there is\na blue cup in front of you. When a state exhibits intentionality, it involves the instantiation of an intentional\nproperty, a property of representing something. What the state\nrepresents is its (intentional) content. In this article, we\nuse the term \u201cstate\u201d for instantantiations of properties,\nwhich are sometimes called token states. (See the entries \n Intentionality\n and\n Mental Representation.)\n \n\nPhenomenal consciousness is the felt, subjective, or\n\u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d aspect of mental states (see Nagel\n1974). Paradigmatic examples of phenomenal states include perceptual\nexperiences, pains, emotional feelings, episodes of mental imagery,\nand cognitive experiences such as the experience of d\u00e9j\u00e0\nvu. Each of these states has a characteristic phenomenal character\u2014there is something that it\u2019s like to be in it. When there is\nsomething that it is like for a subject, we can say that she\ninstantiates a phenomenal property, or that she has a\nphenomenal state. (See the entry\n Consciousness.)\n \n\nPhenomenal intentionality is intentionality that is\nconstituted by phenomenal consciousness. A phenomenal intentional\nstate is an intentional state that is constituted by a subject\u2019s phenomenal states. For example, someone who accepts phenomenal intentionality might say that a perceptual intentional state representing a red cube is constituted by a reddish-cube-ish phenomenal state\u2014the reddish-cube-ish phenomenal experience automatically and necessarily results in the representation of a red cube. We will call intentional states that are not phenomenal intentional states non-phenomenal intentional state.\nPIT takes phenomenal intentionality to play a central role in accounting for intentional phenomena. The next subsections discuss ways that this initial gloss on PIT can be precisified. \nA central idea common to phenomenal intentionality theories is that phenomenal intentionality plays an important role in the mind. The next subsections discuss ways that this idea can be precisified. \n",
