    "main_text": "Voting Paradoxes || Condorcet\u2019s Paradox\n3.1 Condorcet\u2019s Paradox\n\nA very common assumption is that a rational preference\nordering must be transitive (i.e., if \\(A\\) is preferred to\n\\(B\\), and \\(B\\) is preferred to \\(C\\), then \\(A\\) must be preferred\nto \\(C\\)). See the entry on preferences (Hansson and Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff\n2009) for an extended discussion of the rationale behind this\nassumption. Indeed, if a voter\u2019s preference ordering is not\ntransitive, for instance, allowing for cycles (e.g., an ordering of \\(A, B, C\\) with \n\\(A \\succ B \\succ C \\succ A\\), where \\(X\\succ Y\\) means \\(X\\) is strictly preferred to \\(Y\\)), then there is  no alternative that the voter can be said to actually support (for each\nalternative, there is another alternative that the voter strictly prefers). Many\nauthors argue that voters with cyclic preference orderings have\ninconsistent opinions about the candidates and should be\nignored by a voting method (in particular, Condorcet\nforcefully argued this point). A key observation of Condorcet (which\nhas become known as the Condorcet Paradox) is that the majority ordering\nmay have cycles (even when all the voters submit rankings of the alternatives). \n\nCondorcet\u2019s original example was more complicated, but the following\nsituation with three voters and three candidates illustrates the\nphenomenon:\n\n\n# VotersRanking\n1\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n1\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n1\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n\n\nNote that we have: \n\nCandidate \\(A\\) beats candidate \\(B\\)  in a one-on-one\nelection: 2 voters rank \\(A\\) above \\(B\\) compared to 1 voter ranking \\(B\\) above \\(A\\). \nCandidate \\(B\\) beats candidate \\(C\\)  in a one-on-one\nelection: 2 voters rank \\(B\\) above \\(C\\) compared to 1 voter ranking \\(C\\) above \\(B\\). \nCandidate \\(C\\) beats candidate \\(A\\)  in a one-on-one\nelection: 2 voters rank \\(C\\) above \\(A\\) compared to 1 voter ranking \\(A\\) above \\(C\\). \n\n\nThat is, there is a majority cycle \\(A>_M B >_M C >_M A\\). This\nmeans that there is no Condorcet winner. This simple, but fundamental\nobservation has been extensively studied (Gehrlein 2006; Schwartz\n2018). \n3.1.1 Electing the Condorcet Winner\n\nThe Condorcet Paradox shows that there may not always be a Condorcet\nwinner in an election. However, one natural requirement for a voting\nmethod is that if there is a Condorcet winner, then that candidate\nshould be elected. Voting methods that satisfy this property are\ncalled Condorcet consistent. Many of the methods introduced\nabove are not Condorcet consistent. I already presented an example\nshowing that plurality rule is not Condorcet consistent (in fact,\nplurality rule may even elect the Condorcet loser). \n\nThe example from Section 1 shows that Borda Count is not Condorcet\nconsistent. In fact, this is an instance of a general phenomenon that\nFishburn (1974) called Condorcet\u2019s other paradox. Consider the\nfollowing voting situation with 81 voters and three candidates from\nCondorcet 1785. \n\n\n# VotersRanking\n30\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n1\\(A\\s C\\s B\\)\n29\\(B\\s A\\s C\\)\n10\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n10\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n1\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\n\n\nThe majority ordering is \\(A >_M B >_M C\\), so \\(A\\) is the Condorcet\nwinner. Using the Borda rule, we have: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\BS(A) &= 2\\times 31 + 1 \\times 39 + 0 \\times 11 = 101 \\\\\n\\BS(B) &= 2 \\times 39 + 1 \\times 31 + 0 \\times 11 = 109 \\\\\n\\BS(C) &= 2 \\times 11 + 1 \\times 11 + 0 \\times 59 = 33\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nSo, candidate \\(B\\) is the Borda winner. Condorcet pointed out\nsomething more: The only way to elect candidate \\(A\\) using\nany scoring method is to assign more points to candidates\nranked second than to candidates ranked first. Recall that a scoring\nmethod for 3 candidates fixes weights \\(s_1\\ge s_2\\ge s_3\\), where\n\\(s_1\\) points are assigned to candidates ranked 1st, \\(s_2\\) points\nare assigned to candidates ranked 2nd, and \\(s_3\\) points are assigned\nto candidates ranked last. To simplify the calculation, assume that\ncandidates ranked last receive 0 points (i.e., \\(s_3=0\\)). Then, the\nscores assigned to candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nScore(A) &= s_1 \\times 31 + s_2 \\times 39 + 0 \\times 11 \\\\\nScore(B) &= s_1 \\times 39 + s_2 \\times 31 + 0 \\times 11 \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nSo, in order for \\(Score(A) > Score(B)\\), we must have \\((s_1 \\times\n31 + s_2 \\times 39) > (s_1 \\times 39 + s_2 \\times 31)\\), which implies\nthat \\(s_2 > s_1\\). But, of course, it is counterintuitive to give\nmore points for being ranked second than for being ranked first. Peter\nFishburn generalized this example as follows: \n\nTheorem (Fishburn 1974).\n\nFor all \\(m\\ge 3\\), there is some voting situation with a Condorcet\nwinner such that every  scoring rule will have at least\n\\(m-2\\) candidates with a greater score than the Condorcet winner.\n\n\nSo, no scoring rule is Condorcet consistent, but what about other\nmethods? A number of voting methods were devised specifically to\nguarantee that a Condorcet winner will be elected, if one\nexists. The examples below give a flavor of different types of\nCondorcet consistent methods. (See Brams and Fishburn, 2002, and\nFishburn, 1977, for more examples and a discussion of \nCondorcet consistent methods.) \n\n\nCondorcet\u2019s Rule:\n\nEach voter submits a ranking of the candidates. If there is a\nCondorcet winner, then that candidate wins the election. Otherwise,\nall candidates tie for the win. \n\nBlack\u2019s Procedure:\n\nEach voter submits a ranking of the candidates. If there is a\nCondorcet winner, then that candidate is the winner. Otherwise, use \nBorda Count to determine the winners. \n\n\nNanson\u2019s Method:\n\nEach voter submits a ranking of the candidates. Calculate the Borda\nscore for each candidate. The candidates with a Borda score below the\naverage of the Borda scores are eliminated. The Borda scores of the\ncandidates are re-calculated and the process continues until there is\nonly one candidate remaining. (See Niou, 1987, for a discussion of\nthis voting method.) \n\nCopeland\u2019s Rule:\n\nEach voter submits a ranking of the candidates. A win-loss\nrecord for candidate \\(B\\) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nWL(B) = \\#\\{C\\ \\mid\\ B >_M C\\} - \\#\\{C\\ \\mid\\ C >_M B\\}\n\\]\n\n\nThe Copeland winner is the candidate that maximizes the win-loss\nrecord.\n\nSchwartz\u2019s Set Method:\n\nEach voter submits a ranking of the candidates. The winners are the\nsmallest set of candidates that are not beaten in a one-on-one\nelection by any candidate outside the set (Schwartz 1986). \n\nDodgson\u2019s Method:\n\nEach voter submits a ranking of the candidates. For each candidate,\ndetermine the fewest number of pairwise swaps in the voters\u2019 rankings \nneeded to make that candidate the Condorcet winner. The candidate(s) \nwith the fewest swaps is(are) declared the winner(s). \n\n\nThe last method was proposed by Charles Dodgson (better known by the\npseudonym Lewis Carroll). Interestingly, this is an example of a\nprocedure in which it is computationally difficult to compute the\nwinner (that is, the problem of calculating the winner is\nNP-complete). See Bartholdi et al. 1989 for a discussion.\n\n\nThese voting methods (and the other Condorcet consistent methods)\nguarantee that a Condorcet winner, if one exists, will be elected.\nBut, should a Condorcet winner be elected? Many people argue\nthat there is something amiss with a voting method that does not\nalways elect a Condorcet winner (if one exists). The idea is that a\nCondorcet winner best reflects the overall group opinion and is\nstable in the sense that it will defeat any challenger in a one-on-one\ncontest using Majority Rule. The most persuasive argument that the\nCondorcet winner should not always be elected comes from the work of\nDonald Saari (1995, 2001). Consider again Condorcet\u2019s example of 81\nvoters. \n\n\n# VotersRanking\n30\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n1\\(A\\s C\\s B\\)\n29\\(B\\s A\\s C\\)\n10\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n10\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n1\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\n\n\nThis is another example that shows that Borda\u2019s method need not elect\nthe Condorcet winner. The majority ordering is\n\n\\[\nA >_M B >_M C,\n\\]\n\n\nwhile the ranking given by the Borda score is \n\n\\[\nB >_{\\Borda} A >_{\\Borda} C.\n\\]\n\n\nHowever, there is an argument that candidate \\(B\\) is the best choice\nfor this electorate. Saari\u2019s central observation is to note that the\n81 voters can be divided into three groups:\n\n\n # VotersRanking\n10\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\nGroup 110\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n10\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n1\\(A\\s C\\s B\\)\nGroup 21\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\n1\\(B\\s A\\s C\\)\nGroup 320\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n28\\(B\\s A\\s C\\)\n\n\nGroups 1 and 2 constitute majority cycles with the voters evenly\ndistributed among the three possible rankings. Such profiles are\ncalled Condorcet components.  These profiles form a\nperfect symmetry among the rankings. So, within each of these groups,\nit is natural to assume that the  voters\u2019 opinions cancel each other out; therefore, the decision\nshould depend only on the voters in group 3. In group 3, candidate\n\\(B\\) is the clear winner. \n\nBalinski and Laraki (2010, pgs. 74\u201383) have an interesting spin on\nSaari\u2019s argument. Let \\(V\\) be a ranking voting method (i.e., a voting\nmethod that requires voters to rank the alternatives). Say that \\(V\\)\ncancels properly if for all profiles \\(\\bR\\), if \\(V\\)\nselects \\(A\\) as a winner in \\(\\bP\\), then \\(V\\) selects \\(A\\) as\na winner in any profile \\(\\bP+\\bC\\), where \\(\\bC\\) is a\nCondorcet component and \\(\\bP+\\bC\\) is the profile that\ncontains all the rankings from \\(\\bP\\) and \\(\\bC\\). Balinski\nand Laraki (2010, pg. 77) prove that there is no Condorcet consistent\nvoting method that cancels properly. (See the discussion of the\nmultiple districts paradox in Section 3.3 for a proof of a closely\nrelated result.) \n3.2 Failures of Monotonicity\n\nA voting method is monotonic provided that receiving more\nsupport from the voters is always better for a candidate. There are\ndifferent ways to make this idea precise (see Fishburn, 1982, Sanver\nand Zwicker, 2012, and Felsenthal and Tideman, 2013). For instance,\nmoving up in the rankings should not adversely affect a\ncandidate\u2019s chances to win an election. It is easy to see that\nPlurality Rule is monotonic in this sense: The more voters that rank a\ncandidate first, the better chance the candidate has to\nwin. Surprisingly, there are voting methods that do not satisfy this\nnatural property. The most well-known example is Plurality with\nRunoff. Consider the two scenarios below. Note that the only\ndifference between the them is the ranking of the fourth group of\nvoters. This group of two voters ranks \\(B\\) above \\(A\\) above \\(C\\)\nin scenario 1 and swaps \\(B\\) and \\(A\\) in scenario 2 (so, \\(A\\) is\nnow their top-ranked candidate; \\(B\\) is ranked second; and \\(C\\) is\nstill ranked third).\n\n\n# Voters\nScenario 1Ranking\nScenario 2Ranking\n6\n\\(A\\s B\\s C\\) \\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n\n5\n\\(C\\s A\\s B\\) \\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n\n4\n\\(B\\s C\\s A\\) \\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n\n2\n\\(\\bB\\s \\bA\\s C\\) \\(\\bA\\s \\bB\\s C\\)\n\nScenario\n1: Candidate \\(A\\) is the Plurality with Runoff winner\nScenario 2: Candidate\n\\(C\\) is the Plurality with Runoff winner\n\n\n\nIn scenario 1, candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) both have a plurality score\nof 6 while candidate \\(C\\) has a plurality score of 5.  So, \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) move on to the runoff election.  Assuming the voters do not\nchange their rankings, the 5 voters that rank \\(C\\) transfer their\nsupport to candidate \\(A\\), giving her a total of 11 to win the runoff\nelection.  However, in scenario 2, even after moving up in the\nrankings of the fourth group (\\(A\\) is now ranked first by this\ngroup), candidate \\(A\\) does not win this election. In fact,\nby trying to give more support to the winner of the election in\nscenario 1, rather than solidifying \\(A\\)\u2019s win, the last\ngroup\u2019s least-preferred candidate ended up winning the election!\nThe problem arises because in scenario 2, candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare swapped in the last group\u2019s ranking.  This means that\n\\(A\\)\u2019s plurality score increases by 2 and \\(B\\)\u2019s\nplurality score decreases by 2. As a consequence, \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) move\non to the runoff election rather than \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).  Candidate\n\\(C\\) wins the runoff election with 9 voters that rank \\(C\\) above\n\\(A\\) compared to 8 voters that rank \\(A\\) above \\(C\\).\n\n\nThe above example is surprising since it shows that, when using\nPlurality with Runoff, it may not always be beneficial for a candidate\nto move up in some of the voter\u2019s rankings. The other voting methods\nthat violate monotonicity include Coombs Rule, Hare Rule, Dodgson\u2019s\nMethod and Nanson\u2019s Method.  See Felsenthal and Nurmi 2017 for further \ndiscussion of voting methods that are not monotonic. \n3.3 Variable Population Paradoxes\n\nIn this section, I discuss two related paradoxes that involve changes\nto the population of voters. \n\nNo-Show Paradox: One way that a candidate may receive\n\u201cmore support\u201d is to have more voters show up to an\nelection that support them. Voting methods that do not satisfy this\nversion of monotonicity are said to be susceptible to the no-show\nparadox (Fishburn and Brams 1983). Suppose that there are 3\ncandidates and 11 voters with the following rankings: \n\n\n\n# VotersRanking\n4\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n3\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n1\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n3\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\nCandidate \\(C\\) is the Plurality with Runoff winner\n\n\n\nIn the first round, candidates \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are both ranked first\nby 4 voters while \\(B\\) is ranked first by only 3 voters. So, \\(A\\)\nand \\(C\\) move to the runoff round. In this round, the voters in the\nsecond column transfer their votes to candidate \\(C\\), so candidate\n\\(C\\) is the winner beating \\(A\\) 7-4. Suppose that 2 voters in the\nfirst group do not show up to the election: \n\n\n# VotersRanking\n\\(\\mathbf{2}\\)\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n3\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n1\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n3\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\nCandidate \\(B\\) is the Plurality with Runoff winner\n\n\n\nIn this election, candidate \\(A\\) has the lowest plurality score in\nthe first round, so candidates \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) move to the runoff\nround. The first group\u2019s votes are transferred to \\(B\\), so \\(B\\) is\nthe winner beating \\(C\\) 5-4. Since the 2 voters that did not show up\nto this election rank \\(B\\) above \\(C\\), they prefer the outcome of\nthe second election in which they did not participate! \n\nPlurality with Runoff is not the only voting method that is\nsusceptible to the no-show paradox. The Coombs Rule, Hare Rule and\nMajority Judgement (using the tie-breaking mechanism from Balinski and Laraki 2010)\nare all susceptible to the no-show paradox. It turns out that always\nelecting a Condorcet winner, if one exists, makes a voting method\nsusceptible to the above failure of monotonicity.\n\nTheorem (Moulin 1988).\n\nIf there are four or more candidates, then every Condorcet consistent\nvoting method is susceptible to the no-show paradox.\n\n\nSee Perez 2001, Campbell and Kelly 2002, Jimeno et al.\n2009, Duddy 2014, Brandt et al. 2017, 2019, and Nunez and Sanver 2017\nfor further discussions and generalizations of this result. \n\nMultiple Districts Paradox: Suppose that a population is\ndivided into districts. If a candidate wins each of the districts, one\nwould expect that candidate to win the election over the entire\npopulation of voters (assuming that the two districts divide the set of voters \ninto disjoint sets). This is certainly true for Plurality Rule: If a\ncandidate is ranked first by  the most  voters in  each of\nthe districts, then that candidate will also be ranked first by a\nthe most voters over the entire population. Interestingly, this is\nnot true for all voting methods (Fishburn and Brams 1983). The example\nbelow illustrates the paradox for Coombs Rule. \n\n# VotersRanking\nDistrict 13\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n3\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n3\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n1\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\nDistrict 22\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n3\\(B\\s A\\s C\\)\nDistrict 1: Candidate \\(B\\) is the Coombs winner\nDistrict 2: Candidate \\(B\\) is the Coombs winner\n\n\n\nCandidate \\(B\\) wins both districts: \n\n\nDistrict 1: There are a total of 10 voters in this district.\nNone of the candidates are ranked first by 6 or more voters, so\ncandidate \\(A\\), who is ranked last by 4 voters (compared to 3 voters\nranking each of \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) last), is eliminated.\nIn the second round, candidate \\(B\\) wins the election since 6 voters rank \\(B\\) above \\(C\\) and 4 voters rank \\(C\\) above \\(B\\). \n\n\nDistrict 2: There are a total of 5 voters in this district.\nCandidate \\(B\\) is ranked first by a strict majority of voters, so\n\\(B\\) wins the election. \n\n\nCombining the two districts gives the following table:\n\n# VotersRanking\nDistricts 1 + 2\u00a05\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n3\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n3\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n1\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\n3\\(B\\s A\\s C\\)\n Candidate \\(A\\) is the Coombs winner\n\n\n\nThere are 15 total voters in the combined districts. None of the\ncandidates are ranked first by 8 or more of the voters. Candidate\n\\(C\\) receives the most last-place votes, so is eliminated in the\nfirst round. In the second round, candidate \\(A\\) is beats candidate\n\\(B\\) by 1 vote (8 voters rank \\(A\\) above \\(B\\) and 7 voters rank\n\\(B\\) above \\(A\\)), and so is declared the winner. Thus, even though\n\\(B\\) wins both districts, candidate \\(A\\) wins the election when the\ndistricts are combined. \n\nThe other voting methods that are susceptible to the\nmultiple-districts paradox include Plurality with Runoff, The Hare\nRule, and Majority Judgement. Note that these methods are also\nsusceptible to the no-show paradox. As is the case with the no-show\nparadox, every Condorcet consistent voting method is susceptible to\nthe multiple districts paradox (see Zwicker, 2016, Proposition 2.5). I\nsketch the proof of this from Zwicker 2016 (pg. 40) since it adds to\nthe discussion at the end of Section 3.1 about whether the Condorcet\nwinner should be elected. \n\nSuppose that \\(V\\) is a voting method that always selects the\nCondorcet winner (if one exists) and that \\(V\\) is not susceptible to\nthe multiple-districts paradox. This means that if a candidate \\(X\\)\nis among the winners according to \\(V\\) in each of two districts, then\n\\(X\\) must be among the winners according to \\(V\\) in the combined\ndistricts. Consider the following two districts.\n\n# VotersRanking\nDistrict 12\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n2\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n2\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\nDistrict 21\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n\n2\\(B\\s A\\s C\\)\n\n\n\nNote that in district 2 candidate \\(B\\) is the Condorcet winner, so\nmust be the only winner according to \\(V\\). In district 1, there are\nno Condorcet winners. If candidate \\(B\\) is among the winners\naccording to \\(V\\), then, in order to not be susceptible to the\nmultiple districts paradox, \\(B\\) must be among the winners in the\ncombined districts. In fact, since \\(B\\) is the only winner in\ndistrict 2, \\(B\\) must be the only winner in the combined districts.\nHowever, in the combined districts, candidate \\(A\\) is the Condorcet\nwinner, so must be the (unique) winner according to \\(V\\). This is a\ncontradiction, so \\(B\\) cannot be among the winners according to \\(V\\)\nin district 1. A similar argument shows that neither \\(A\\) nor \\(C\\)\ncan be among the winners according to \\(V\\) in district 1 by swapping\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in the first case and \\(B\\) with \\(C\\) in the second\ncase in the rankings of the voters in district 2. Since \\(V\\) must\nassign at least one winner to every profile, this is a contradiction;\nand so, \\(V\\) is susceptible to the multiple districts paradox. \n\nOne last comment about this paradox: It is an example of a more\ngeneral phenomenon known as Simpson\u2019s Paradox (Malinas and Bigelow\n2009). See Saari (2001, Section 4.2) for a discussion of Simpson\u2019s\nParadox in the context of voting theory. \n3.4 The Multiple Elections Paradox\n\nThe paradox discussed in this section, first introduced by Brams,\nKilgour and Zwicker (1998), has a somewhat different structure from\nthe paradoxes discussed above. Voters are taking part in a\nreferendum, where they are asked their opinion directly about\nvarious propositions (cf. the discussion of Quadratic Voting and Liquid Democracy\n in Section 2.3). So, voters must select either \u201cyes\u201d\n(Y) or \u201cno\u201d (N) for each proposition. Suppose that there\nare 13 voters who cast the following votes for the three propositions (so\nvoters can cast one of eight possible votes): \n\n# VotersPropositions\n1YYY \n1YYN \n1YNY \n3YNN \n1NYY \n3NYN \n3NNY \n0NNN \n\n\nWhen the votes are tallied for each proposition separately, the\noutcome is N for each proposition (N wins 7\u20136 for all three\npropositions). Putting this information together, this means that NNN\nis the outcome of this election. However, there is no support\nfor this outcome in this population of voters.  This raises an important \nquestion about what outcome reflects the group opinion: Viewing each proposition \nseparately, there is clear support for N on each proposition; however, \nthere is no support for the entire package of N for all propositions. \nBrams et al. (1998,  pg. 234) nicely summarise the issue as follows: \n\nThe paradox does not just highlight problems of aggregation and\npackaging, however, but strikes at the core of social\nchoice\u2014both what it means and how to uncover it. In our view,\nthe paradox shows there may be a clash between two different meanings\nof social choice, leaving unsettled the best way to uncover what this\nelusive quantity is.\n\n\nSee Scarsini 1998, Lacy  and Niou 2000, Xia et al. 2007, and Lang and Xia 2009 for further discussion of this paradox. \n\n\nA similar issue is raised by Anscombe\u2019s paradox (Anscombe\n1976), in which: \n\nIt is possible for a majority of voters to be on the losing side of a\nmajority of issues.\n\n\nThis phenomenon is illustrated by the following example with five\nvoters voting on three different issues (the voters either vote\n\u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 on the different issues).\n\nIssue 1Issue 2Issue 3\nVoter 1yesyesno\nVoter 2nonono\nVoter 3noyesyes\nVoter 4yesnoyes\nVoter 5yesnoyes\nMajority: yesnoyes\n\n\n\nHowever, a majority of the voters (voters 1, 2 and 3) do not\nsupport the majority outcome on a majority of the issues (note that\nvoter 1 does not support the majority outcome on issues 2 and 3; voter\n2 does not support the majority outcome on issues 1 and 3; and voter 3\ndoes not support the majority outcome on issues 1 and 2)! \n\nThe issue is more interesting when the voters do not vote directly on\nthe issues, but on candidates that take positions on the different\nissues. Suppose there are two candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) who take the\nfollowing positions on the three issues: \n\nIssue 1Issue 2Issue 3\nCandidate \\(A\\)yesnoyes\nCandidate \\(B\\)noyesno\n\n\nCandidate \\(A\\) takes the majority position, agreeing with a majority\nof the voters on each issue, and candidate \\(B\\) takes the opposite,\nminority position. Under the natural assumption that voters will vote\nfor the candidate who agrees with their position on a majority of the\nissues, candidate \\(B\\) will win the election (each of the voters 1, 2\nand 3 agree with \\(B\\) on two of the three issues, so \\(B\\) wins the\nelection 3\u20132)! This version of the paradox is known as\nOstrogorski\u2019s Paradox (Ostrogorski 1902). See Kelly 1989; Rae\nand Daudt 1976; Wagner 1983, 1984; and Saari 2001, Section 4.6, for\nanalyses of this paradox, and Pigozzi 2005 for the relationship with \n\tthe judgement aggregation literature (List 2013, Section 5).\n4. Topics in Voting Theory\n4.1 Strategizing\n\nIn the discussion above, I have assumed that voters select ballots\nsincerely. That is, the voters are simply trying to\ncommunicate their opinions about the candidates under the constraints\nof the chosen voting method. However, in many contexts, it makes sense to \nassume that voters choose strategically. One need only look to recent\nU.S. elections to see concrete examples of strategic voting. The most\noften cited example is the 2000 U.S. election: Many voters who ranked\nthird-party candidate Ralph Nader first voted for their second choice\n(typically Al Gore). A detailed overview of the literature on\nstrategic voting is beyond the scope of this article (see Taylor 2005 and  \nSection 3.3 of List 2013 for   discussions and pointers to the relevant literature; also see\nPoundstone 2008 for an entertaining and informative discussion of the\noccurrence of this phenomenon in many actual elections). I will\nexplain the main issues, focusing on specific voting rules. \n\nThere are two general types of manipulation that can be studied in the\ncontext of voting. The first is manipulation by a moderator or outside\nparty that has the authority to set the agenda or select the voting\nmethod that will be used. So, the outcome of an election is not\nmanipulated from within by unhappy voters, but, rather, it is\ncontrolled by an outside authority figure. To illustrate this\ntype of control, consider a population with three voters whose\nrankings of four candidates are given in the table below: \n\n\n# VotersRanking\n1\\(B\\s D\\s C\\s A\\)\n1\\(A\\s B\\s D\\s C\\)\n1\\(C\\s A\\s B\\s D\\)\n\n\nNote that everyone prefers candidate \\(B\\) over candidate \\(D\\).\nNonetheless, a moderator can ask the right questions so that candidate\n\\(D\\) ends up being elected. The moderator proceeds as follows: First,\nask the voters if they prefer candidate \\(A\\) or candidate \\(B\\).\nSince the voters prefer \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) by a margin of 2 to 1, the\nmoderator  declares that candidate \\(B\\) is no longer in the running.\nThe moderator then asks voters to choose between candidate \\(A\\) and\ncandidate \\(C\\). Candidate \\(C\\) wins this election 2\u20131, so\ncandidate \\(A\\) is removed. Finally, in the last round the chairman\nasks voters to choose between candidates \\(C\\) and  \\(D\\).\nCandidate \\(D\\) wins this election 2\u20131 and is declared the\nwinner. \n\nA second type of manipulation focuses on how the voters themselves can\nmanipulate the outcome of an election by misrepresenting\ntheir preferences. Consider the following two election scenarios \nwith 7 voters and 3 candidates:\n\n# VotersScenario 1Ranking\nScenario 2Ranking\n1\\(C\\s D\\s B\\s A\\) \\(C\\s D\\s B\\s A\\)\n1\\(B\\s A\\s C\\s D\\) \\(B\\s A\\s C\\s D\\)\n\n1\\(A\\s  \\bC\\s  \\bB\\s  \\bD\\)\n\\(A\\s \\bB\\s  \\bD\\s  \\bC\\)\n\n1\\(A\\s C\\s D\\s B\\) \\(A\\s C\\s D\\s B\\)\n\n1\\(D\\s C\\s A\\s B\\) \\(D\\s C\\s A\\s B\\)\n\nScenario 1: Candidate \\(C\\) is the Borda winner  (\\(\\BS(A)=9, \\BS(B)=5, \\BS(C)=10\\), and \\(\\BS(D)=6\\))\nScenario 2: Candidate \\(A\\) is the Borda winner\n(\\(\\BS(A)=9, \\BS(B)=6, \\BS(C)=8\\), and \\(\\BS(D)=7\\))\n\n\n\nThe only difference between the two election scenarios is that the third voter\nchanged the ranking of the bottom three candidates.  In election scenario 1, the third \nvoter has candidate \\(A\\) ranked first, then \\(C\\) ranked second, \\(B\\) ranked third \nand \\(D\\) ranked last.   In election scenario 2, this voter still has \\(A\\) ranked\nfirst, but ranks \\(B\\) second, \\(D\\) third and \\(C\\) last. In  election scenario 1, candidate \\(C\\) is the Borda Count winner (the Borda scores are \\(\\BS(A)=9, \\BS(B)=5, \\BS(C)=10\\), and \\(\\BS(D)=6\\)).   In the  election scenario 2, candidate \\(A\\) is \nthe Borda Count winner (the Borda scores are \\(\\BS(A)=9, \\BS(B)=6, \\BS(C)=8\\), and \\(\\BS(D)=7\\)).   \nAccording to her ranking in election scenario 1, this voter prefers the outcome in election scenario 2 (candidate \\(A\\), the Borda winner in election scenario 2, is ranked above candidate \\(C\\), the Borda winner in election scenario 1).    So, if we assume that\nelection scenario 1 represents the \u201ctrue\u201d preferences of the\nelectorate, it is in the interest of the third voter  to misrepresent\nher preferences as in election scenario 2.  This is an instance of a general result known as the\nGibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem (Gibbard 1973; Satterthwaite\n1975): Under natural assumptions, there is no voting method that\nguarantees that voters will choose their ballots sincerely\n(for a precise statement of this theorem \nsee Theorem 3.1.2 from Taylor 2005 or Section 3.3 of List 2013). \n4.2 Characterization Results\n\nMuch of the literature on voting theory (and, more generally, social\nchoice theory) is focused on so-called axiomatic characterization\nresults. The main goal is to characterize different voting\nmethods in terms of abstract principles of collective decision making.\nSee Pauly 2008 and Endriss 2011 for interesting discussions of\naxiomatic characterization results from a logician\u2019s point-of-view.\n\n\nConsult  List  2013  and Gaertner 2006 for introductions to \nthe vast literature on axiomatic characterizations in social choice theory. \nIn this article, I focus on a few key axioms and results and how they \nrelate to the voting methods and paradoxes discussed above. I start with \nthree core principles. \n\nAnonymity: The names of the voters do not matter: If two\nvoters swap their ballots, then the outcome of the election is\nunaffected.\nNeutrality: The names of the candidates, or alternatives, do not\nmatter: If two candidates are exchanged in every ballot, then the\noutcome of the election changes accordingly. \nUniversal Domain: There are no restrictions on the voter\u2019s\nchoice of ballots. In other words, no profile of ballots can be\nignored by a voting method. One way to make this precise is to require\nthat voting methods are total functions on the set of all\nprofiles (recall that a profile is a sequence of ballots, one from\neach voter). \n\n\nThese properties ensure that the outcome of an election depends only\non the voters\u2019 ballots, with all the voters and candidates being treated equally.\nOther properties are intended to rule out some of the paradoxes and\nanomalies discussed above. In section 4.1, there is an example of a\nsituation in which a candidate is elected, even though all\nthe voters prefer a different candidate. The next principle rules out\nsuch situations: \n\nUnanimity (also called the Pareto Principle): If candidate\n\\(A\\) is ranked above candidate \\(B\\) by all voters, then\ncandidate \\(B\\) should not win the election. \n\nThese are natural properties to impose on any voting method. A\nsurprising consequence of these properties is that they rule out\nanother natural property that one may want to impose: Say that a\nvoting method is resolute if the method always selects one\nwinner (i.e., there are no ties). Suppose that  \\(V\\) is a voting\nmethod that requires voters to rank the candidates and that there are\nat least 3 candidates and enough voters to form a Condorcet\ncomponent (a profile generating a majority cycle with voters evenly\ndistributed among the different rankings).  First, consider the situation when \nthere are exactly 3 candidates (in this case, we do not need to assume Unanimity).   \nDivide the set of voters into \nthree groups of size \\(n\\) and consider the Condorcet component: \n\n\n\n# VotersRanking\n\\(n\\)\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n\\(n\\)\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n\\(n\\)\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n\n\nBy  Universal Domain and resoluteness, \\(V\\) must select exactly one of \n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), or \\(C\\) as the winner.   Assume that \\(V\\) select \\(A\\) \nas the winner (the argument when \\(V\\) selects the other candidates is similar).  \nNow, consider the profile in which every  voter swaps candidate \\(A\\) \nand \\(B\\) in their rankings: \n\n\n\n# VotersRanking\n\\(n\\)\\(B\\s A\\s C\\)\n\\(n\\)\\(A\\s C\\s B\\)\n\\(n\\)\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\n\n\nBy Neutrality and Universal Domain, \\(V\\) must elect candidate \\(B\\) in this election scenario.  Now, consider the profile in which every voter in the above election scenario swaps candidates \\(B\\) and \\(C\\): \n\n\n\n# VotersRanking\n\\(n\\)\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n\\(n\\)\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n\\(n\\)\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n\n\nBy Neutrality and Universal Domain, \\(V\\) must elect candidate \\(C\\)\nin this election scenario.  Notice that this last election scenario\ncan be generated by permuting the voters in the first election\nscenario (to generate the last election scenario from the first\nelection scenario, move the first group of voters to the 2nd position,\nthe 2nd group of voters to the 3rd position and the 3rd group of\nvoters to the first position).  But this contradicts Anonymity since\nthis requires \\(V\\) to elect the same candidate in the first and third\nelection scenario. To extend this result to more than 3 candidates,\nconsider a profile in which candidates \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are all\nranked above any other candidate and the restriction to these three\ncandidates forms a Condorcet component.  If \\(V\\) satisfies Unanimity,\nthen no candidate except \\(A\\), \\(B\\) or \\(C\\) can be elected. Then,\nthe above argument shows that \\(V\\) cannot satisfy Resoluteness,\nUniversal Domain, Neutrality, and Anonymity.  That is, there are no\nResolute voting methods that satisfy Universal Domain, Anonymity,\nNeutrality, and Unanimity for 3 or more candidates (note that I have\nassumed that the number of voters is a multiple of 3, see Moulin 1983\nfor the full proof).\n\n\nSection 3.2 discussed examples in which candidates end up losing an\nelection as a result of more support from some of the voters. There\nare many ways to state properties that require a voting method to be\nmonotonic. The following strong version (called Positive\nResponsiveness in the literature) is used to characterize majority\nrule when there are only two candidates: \n\nPositive Responsiveness: If candidate \\(A\\) is a winner or\ntied for the win and moves up in some of the voter\u2019s rankings, then\ncandidate \\(A\\) is the unique winner. \n\nI can now state our first characterization result. Note that in all of\nthe example discussed above, it is crucial that there are three or\nmore candidates (for example, stating Condorcet\u2019s paradox requires there \nto be  three or more candidates). When there are only two\ncandidates, or alternatives, Majority Rule (choose the alternative ranked\nfirst by more than 50% of the voters) can be singled out as \u201cbest\u201d: \n\nTheorem (May 1952).\n\n  A voting method for choosing between two candidates satisfies\nNeutrality, Anonymity, Unanimity and Positive Responsiveness if and only if the\nmethod is majority rule.\n\n\nSee May 1952 for a precise statement of this theorem and Asan and\nSanver 2002, Maskin 1995, and Woeginger 2003 for \nalternative characterizations of majority rule. \n\n\nA key  assumption in the proof May\u2019s theorem and  subsequent  results is the \nrestriction to voting on  two  alternatives.  When there are only two \nalternatives, the definition of a ballot can be simplified since a \nranking of two alternatives boils down to selecting the alternative \nthat is ranked first.  The  above characterizations of Majority \nRule work in a more general setting since they  also allow  \nvoters to abstain  (which is ambiguous between not voting \nand being indifferent between the alternatives).  So, if the alternatives \nare  \\(\\{A,B\\}\\), then there are three possible ballots: selecting \\(A\\), \nselecting \\(B\\), or abstaining (which is treated as selecting both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)).  \nA natural question is whether there are May-style  characterization theorems \nfor more than two alternatives.    A crucial issue is  that  rankings of more than \ntwo alternatives are much more informative than selecting an alternative or abstaining.  By  restricting the information required \nfrom a  voter to selecting one of the alternatives or abstaining, \nGoodin and List 2006 prove that the  axioms used in May\u2019s Theorem characterize \nPlurality  Rule when there are more than two alternatives.  They also show that a\n minor  modification of the axioms characterize Approval Voting when voters are allowed to \n select more than one alternative. \n\n\n Note that  focusing on voting methods that limit the information required from \n the voters  to selecting one or more of the alternatives  hides all the interesting \n phenomena discussed in the previous sections, such as the existence of a Condorcet paradox.  \nReturning to the study of voting methods  that require voters to rank the alternatives, \nthe most important characterization result is Ken Arrow\u2019s celebrated impossibility \ntheorem (1963). Arrow showed that there is no social welfare function (a social\nwelfare function maps the voters\u2019 rankings (possibly allowing ties) to\na single social ranking) satisfying universal domain, unanimity,\nnon-dictatorship (there is no voter \\(d\\) such that for all profiles,\nif \\(d\\) ranks \\(A\\) above \\(B\\) in the profile, then the social\nordering ranks \\(A\\) above \\(B\\)) and the following key property: \n\n\nIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives: The social ranking\n(higher, lower, or indifferent) of two candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\ndepends only on the relative rankings of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) for each\nvoter. \n\nThis means that if the voters\u2019 rankings of two candidates \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) are the same in two different election scenarios, then the\nsocial rankings of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must be the same. This is a very\nstrong property that has been extensively criticized (see Gaertner,\n2006, for pointers to the relevant literature, and Cato, 2014, for a\ndiscussion of generalizations of this property). It is beyond the\nscope of this article to go into detail about the proof and the\nramifications of Arrow\u2019s theorem (see Morreau, 2014, for this\ndiscussion), but I note that many of the voting methods we have\ndiscussed do not satisfy the above property. A striking example of a\nvoting method that does not satisfy Independence of Irrelevant\nAlternatives is Borda Count. Consider the following two election\nscenarios:\n\n# Voters\nScenario 1Ranking\nScenario 2Ranking\n3\\(A\\s B\\s C\\s \\bX\\)\n\\(A\\s B\\s C\\s \\bX\\)\n\n2\\(B\\s C\\s A\\s \\bX\\)\n\\(B\\s C\\s \\bX\\s A\\)\n\n2\\(C\\s  A\\s  B\\s  \\bX\\)\n\\(C\\s  \\bX\\s A\\s B\\)\n\nScenario 1: The Borda ranking is \\(A >_{\\Borda} B >_{\\Borda} C >_{\\Borda} X\\)  (\\(\\BS(A)=15\\), \\(\\BS(B)=14\\), \\(\\BS(C)=13\\), and \\(\\BS(X)=0\\))\nScenario 2: The Borda ranking is \\(C >_{\\Borda} B >_{\\Borda} A >_{\\Borda} X\\)  (\\(\\BS(A)=11\\), \\(\\BS(B)=12\\), \\(\\BS(C)=13\\), and \\(\\BS(X)=6\\))\n\n\n\nNotice that the relative rankings of candidates \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\)\nare the same in both election scenarios. In the election scenario 2, the\nranking  of candidate \\(X\\), that is uniformly ranked in last place in\n election scenario 1, is changed. The ranking according to the\nBorda score of the candidates in election scenario 1 puts \\(A\\) first with 15\npoints, \\(B\\) second with 14 points, \\(C\\) third with 13 points, and\n\\(X\\) last with 0 points. In election scenario 2, the ranking of \\(A\\), \\(B\\)\nand \\(C\\) is reversed: Candidate \\(C\\) is first with 13 voters;\ncandidate \\(B\\) is second with 12 points; candidate \\(A\\) is third\nwith 11 points; and candidate \\(X\\) is last with 6 points. So, even\nthough the relative rankings of candidates \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) do\nnot differ in the two election scenarios, the position of candidate \\(X\\)\nin the voters\u2019 rankings reverses the Borda rankings of these candidates. \n\nIn Section 3.3, it was noted that a number of methods (including all\nCondorcet consistent methods) are susceptible to the multiple\ndistricts paradox. An example of a method that is not susceptible to\nthe multiple districts paradox is Plurality Rule: If a candidate\nreceives the most first place votes in two different districts, then\nthat candidate must receive the most first place votes in the combined\nthe districts. More generally, no scoring rule is susceptible to the\nmultiple districts paradox. This property is called reinforcement:\n\n\nReinforcement:\nSuppose that \\(N_1\\) and \\(N_2\\) are\ndisjoint sets of voters facing the same set of candidates. Further,\nsuppose that \\(W_1\\) is the set of winners for the population \\(N_1\\),\nand \\(W_2\\) is the set of winners for the population \\(N_2\\). If there\nis at least one candidate that wins both elections, then the winner(s)\nfor the entire population (including voters from both \\(N_1\\) and\n\\(N_2\\)) is the set of candidates that are in both \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\)\n(i.e., the winners for the entire population is \\(W_1\\cap W_2\\)).\n\nThe reinforcement property explicitly rules out the multiple-districts\nparadox (so, candidates that win all sub-elections are guaranteed to\nwin the full election). In order to characterize all scoring rules,\none additional technical property is needed: \n\nContinuity: Suppose that a group of voters \\(N_1\\) elects a\ncandidate \\(A\\) and a disjoint group of voters \\(N_2\\) elects a\ndifferent candidate \\(B\\). Then there must be some number \\(m\\) such\nthat the population consisting of the subgroup \\(N_2\\) together with\n\\(m\\) copies of \\(N_1\\) will elect \\(A\\).\n\nWe then have:\n\nTheorem (Young 1975).\n\nSuppose that \\(V\\) is a voting method that requires voters to rank the\ncandidates. Then, \\(V\\) satisfies Anonymity, Neutrality, Reinforcement\nand Continuity if and only if the method is a scoring rule.\n\n\nSee Merlin 2003 and Chebotarev and Smais 1998 for surveys of other\ncharacterizations of scoring rules. Additional axioms single out Borda\nCount among all scoring methods (Young 1974; Gardenfors 1973; Nitzan\nand Rubinstein 1981). In fact, Saari has argued that \u201cany fault\nor paradox admitted by Borda\u2019s method also must be admitted by all\nother positional voting methods\u201d (Saari 1989, pg. 454). For\nexample, it is often remarked that Borda Count (and all scoring rules)\ncan be easily manipulated by the voters. Saari (1995, Section 5.3.1)\nshows that among all scores rules Borda Count is the least susceptible\nto manipulation (in the sense that it has the fewest profiles where a\nsmall percentage of voters can manipulate the outcome). \n\nI have glossed over an important detail of Young\u2019s characterization of\nscoring rules. Note that the reinforcement property refers to the\nbehavior of a voting method on different populations of voters. To\nmake this precise, the formal definition of a voting method must allow for \ndomains that include profiles (i.e., sequences of ballots) of different\nlengths. To do this, it is convenient to assume that the domain of a\nvoting method is an anonymized profile: Given a set of ballots\n\\(\\mathcal{B}\\), an anonymous profile is a function\n\\(\\pi:\\mathcal{B}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}\\). Let \\(\\Pi\\) be the set of\nall anonymous profiles. A variable domain voting method assigns\na non-empty set of voters to each anonymous profile\u2014i.e., it is a function\n\\(V:\\Pi\\rightarrow \\wp(X)-\\emptyset\\)). Of course, this builds in the\nproperty of Anonymity into the definition of a voting method. For this\nreason, Young (1975) does not need to state Anonymity as a\ncharacterizing property of scoring rules. \n\nYoung\u2019s axioms identify scoring rules out of the set of all functions\ndefined from ballots that are rankings of candidates. In order to\ncharacterize the voting methods from Section 2.2, we need to change\nthe set of ballots. For example, in order to characterize Approval\nVoting, the set of ballots \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is the set of non-empty\nsubsets of the set of candidates\u2014i.e.,\n\\(\\mathcal{B}=\\wp(X)-\\emptyset\\) (selecting the ballot \\(X\\)\nconsisting of all candidates means that the voter abstains).\nTwo additional axioms are needed to characterize Approval Voting:\n\n\nFaithfulness: If there is exactly one voter in the population,\nthen the winners are the set of voters chosen by that voter. \n\nCancellation: If all candidates receive the same number of\nvotes (i.e., they are elements of the same number of ballots) from the\nparticipating voters, then all candidates are winning. \n\nWe then have:\n\nTheorem (Fishburn 1978b; Alos-Ferrer 2006 ).\n\nA variable domain voting method where the ballots are non-empty sets\nof candidates is Approval Voting if and only if it satisfies\nFaithfulness, Cancellation, and Reinforcement.\n\n\nNote that Approval Voting satisfies Neutrality even though it is not\nlisted as one of the characterizing properties in the above\ntheorem. This is because Alos-Ferrer (2006) showed that Neutrality is\na consequence of Faithfulness, Cancellation and Reinforcement. See\nFishburn 1978a and Baigent and Xu 1991 for alternative\ncharacterizations of Approval Voting, and Xu 2010 for a survey of the\ncharacterizations of Approval Voting (cf. the characterization of\nApproval Voting from Goodin and List 2006). \n\nMyerson (1995) introduced a general framework for characterizing\nabstract scoring rules that include Borda Count and Approval\nVoting as examples. The key idea is to think of a ballot, called a\nsignal or a vote, as a function from candidates to a set\n\\(\\mathcal{V}\\), where \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is a set of numbers. That is,\nthe set of ballots is a subset of \\(\\mathcal{V}^X\\) (the set of functions\nfrom \\(X\\) to \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)). Then, an anonymous profile of signals\nassigns a score to each candidate \\(X\\) by summing the numbers\nassigned to \\(X\\) by each voter. This allows us to define voting methods \nby specifying the set of ballots: \n\nPlurality Rule: The ballots are functions assigning 0 or 1 to the\ncandidates such that exactly one candidate is assigned 1: \\(\\{v\\ |\\\nv\\in \\{0,1\\}^X\\) and there is an \\(A\\in X\\) such that \\(v(A)=1\\) and\nfor all \\(B\\), if \\(B\\ne A\\), then \\(v(B)=0\\}\\) \n Approval Voting: The ballots are functions assigning 0 or 1 to\nthe candidates: \\(\\{v\\ |\\ v\\in \\{0,1\\}^X \\}\\) \n Borda Count: The ballots are functions assigning numbers from the\nset \\(\\{\\#X, \\#X-1,\\ldots,0\\}\\) such that each candidate is assigned\nexactly one of the numbers: \\(\\{v\\ |\\ v\\in\\{\\# X, \\# X - 1, \\ldots,\n0\\}^X\\) such that \\(v\\) is a bijection\\(\\}\\) \n Range Voting: The ballots are assignments of real numbers between\n0 and 1 to candidates: \\([0,1]^X = \\{v \\ |\\ v:X\\rightarrow [0,1] \\}\\)\n\n Cumulative Voting: The ballots are assignments of real numbers\nbetween 0 and 1 to candidates such that the assignments sum to 1: \\(\n\\{v \\ |\\ v\\in [0,1]^X\\) and \\(\\sum_{A\\in X} v(A)=1\\}\\) \n Formal Utilitarian: The ballots are assignments of real numbers\nto candidates: \\(\\mathbb{R}^X = \\{v \\ |\\ v:X\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\\}\\).\n\n\n\nMyerson (1995) showed that an abstract voting rule is an abstract\nscoring rule if and only if it satisfies Reinforcement, Universal\nDomain (i.e. it is defined for all anonymous profiles), a version of\nthe Neutrality property (adapted to the more abstract setting), and\nthe Continuity property, which is called Overwhelming Majority.\nPivato (2013) generalizes this result, and Gaertner and Xu (2012)\nprovide a related characterization result (using different\nproperties). Pivato (2014) characterizes Formal Utilitarian and Range\nVoting within the class of abstract scoring rules, and Mace (2018)\nextends this approach to cover a wider class of grading voting methods\n(including Majority Judgement). \n4.3 Voting to Track the Truth\n\nThe voting methods discussed above have been judged on\nprocedural grounds. This \u201cproceduralist approach to\ncollective decision making\u201d is defined by Coleman and Ferejohn\n(1986, p. 7) as one that \u201cidentifies a set of ideals with which\nany collective decision-making procedure ought to comply. \u2026 [A]\nprocess of collective decision making would be more or less\njustifiable depending on the extent to which it satisfies them.\u201d\nThe authors add that a distinguishing feature of proceduralism is that\n\u201cwhat justifies a [collective] decision-making procedure is\nstrictly a necessary property of the procedure \u2014 one entailed by\nthe definition of the procedure alone.\u201d Indeed, the\ncharacterization theorems discussed in the previous section can be\nviewed as an implementation of this idea (cf. Riker 1982). The general\nview is to analyze voting methods in terms of \u201cfairness\ncriteria\u201d that ensure that a given method is sensitive to\nall of the voters\u2019 opinions in the right way. \n\nHowever, one may not be interested only in whether a collective\ndecision was arrived at \u201cin the right way,\u201d but in whether\nor not the collective decision is correct. This\nepistemic approach to voting is nicely explained by Joshua\nCohen (1986, p. 34): \n\nAn epistemic interpretation of voting has three main elements: (1) an\nindependent standard of correct decisions \u2014 that is, an account\nof justice or of the common good that is independent of current\nconsensus and the outcome of votes; (2) a cognitive account of voting\n\u2014 that is, the view that voting expresses beliefs about what the\ncorrect policies are according to the independent standard, not\npersonal preferences for policies; and (3) an account of decision\nmaking as a process of the adjustment of beliefs, adjustments that are\nundertaken in part in light of the evidence about the correct answer\nthat is provided by the beliefs of others.  \n\n\n\nUnder this interpretation of voting, a given method is judged on how\nwell it \u201ctracks the truth\u201d of some objective fact (the\ntruth of which is independent of the method being used). A\ncomprehensive comparison of these two approaches to voting touches on\na number of issues surrounding the justification of democracy (cf.\nChristiano 2008); however, I will not focus on these broader issues\nhere. Instead, I briefly discuss an analysis of Majority Rule that\ntakes this epistemic approach. \n\nThe most well-known analysis comes from the writings of Condorcet\n(1785). The following theorem, which is attributed to Condorcet and\nwas first proved formally by Laplace, shows that if there are only two\noptions, then majority rule is, in fact, the best procedure from an\nepistemic point of view. This is interesting because it also shows\nthat a proceduralist analysis and an epistemic analysis both single\nout Majority Rule as the \u201cbest\u201d voting method when there\nare only two candidates. \n\nAssume that there are \\(n\\) voters that have to decide between two\nalternatives. Exactly one of these alternatives is (objectively)\n\u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cbetter.\u201d The typical example\nhere is a jury deciding whether or not a defendant is guilty. The two\nassumptions of the Condorcet jury theorem are: \n\nIndependence: The voters\u2019 opinions are probabilistically\nindependent (so, the probability that two or more voters are correct\nis the product of the probability that each individual voter is\ncorrect). \nVoter Competence: The probability that a voter makes the\ncorrect decision is greater than 1/2 (and this probability is the same\nfor all voters, though this is not crucial). \n\n\nSee Dietrich 2008 for a critical discussion of these two assumptions.\nThe classic theorem is: \n\nCondorcet Jury Theorem.\n\nSuppose that Independence and Voter Competence are both satisfied.\nThen, as the group size increases, the probability that the majority\nchooses the correct option increases and converges to certainty.\n\n\nSee Nitzan 2010 (part III) and Dietrich and Spiekermann 2013 for modern\nexpositions of this theorem, and Goodin and Spiekermann 2018 for\nimplications for the theory of democracy. \n\nCondorcet envisioned that the above argument could be adapted to\nvoting situations with more than two alternatives. Young (1975, 1988, 1995) \nwas the first to fully work out this\nidea (cf. List and Goodin 2001 who generalize the Condorcet Jury  \nTheorem to more than two alternatives in a different framework). \nHe showed (among other things) that the Borda Count can be\nviewed as the maximum likelihood estimator for identifying\nthe best candidate. Conitzer and Sandholm (2005), Conitzer et\nal. (2009), Xia et al. (2010), and Xia (2016) take these ideas further\nby classifying different voting methods according to whether or not\nthe methods can be viewed as a maximum likelihood estimator\n(for a noise model). The most general results along these lines can be\nfound in Pivato 2013 which contains a series of results showing when\nvoting methods can be interpreted as different kinds of statistical\n\u2018estimators\u2019. \n4.4 Computational Social Choice\n\nOne of the most active and exciting areas of research that is focused,\nin part, on the study of voting methods and voting paradoxes is\ncomputational social choice. This is an interdisciplinary\nresearch area that uses ideas and techniques from theoretical computer\nscience and artificial intelligence to provide new perspectives and to\nask new questions about methods for making group decisions; and to use\nvoting methods in computational domains, such as recommendation\nsystems, information retrieval, and crowdsourcing. It is beyond the\nscope of this article to survey this entire research area. Readers are\nencouraged to consult the Handbook of Computational Social\nChoice (Brandt et al. 2016) for an overview of this field (cf.\nalso Endriss 2017). In the remainder of this section, I briefly\nhighlight some work from this research area related to issues\ndiscussed in this article. \n\nSection 4.1 discussed election scenarios in which voters choose their\nballots strategically and briefly introduced the Gibbard-Satterthwaite\nTheorem. This theorem shows that every voting method satisfying\nnatural properties has profiles in which there is some voter, called a\nmanipulator, that can achieve a better outcome by selecting a\nballot that misrepresents her preferences. Importantly, in order to\nsuccessfully manipulate an election, the manipulator must not only\nknow which voting method is being used but also how the other members\nof society are voting. Although there is some debate about whether\nmanipulation in this sense is in fact a problem (Dowding and van Hees\n2008; Conitzer and Walsh, 2016, Section 6.2), there is interest in\nmechanisms that incentivize voters to report their\n\u201ctruthful\u201d preferences. In a seminal paper, Bartholdi et\nal. (1989) argue that the complexity of computing which ballot will\nlead to a preferred outcome for the manipulator may provide a barrier\nto voting insincerely. See Faliszewski and Procaccia 2010, Faliszewski\net al. 2010, Walsh 2011, Brandt et al. 2013, and Conitzer and Walsh\n2016 for surveys of the literature on this and related questions, such\nas the the complexity of determining the winner given a voting method\nand the complexity of determining which voter or voters should be\nbribed to change their vote to achieve a given outcome. \n\nOne of the most interesting lines of research in computational social\nchoice is to use techniques and ideas from AI and theoretical computer\nscience to design new voting methods. The main idea is to think of\nvoting methods as solutions to an optimization problem. Consider the\nspace of all rankings of the alternatives \\(X\\). Given a profile of\nrankings, the voting problem is to find an \u201coptimal\u201d group\nranking (cf. the discussion or distance-based\nrationalizations of voting methods from Elkind et al. 2015). What\ncounts as an \u201coptimal\u201d group ranking depends on\nassumptions about the type of the decision that the group is making.\nOne assumption is that the voters have real-valued utilities\nfor each candidate, but are only able to report rankings of the\nalternatives (it is assumed that the rankings represent the utility\nfunctions). The voting problem is to identify the candidates that\nmaximizes the (expected) social welfare (the average of the voters\u2019\nutilities), given the  partial information about the voters\u2019\nutilities\u2014i.e., the profile of rankings of the candidates. See\nPivato 2015 for a discussion of this approach to voting and Boutilier\net al. 2015 for algorithms that solve different versions of this\nproblem. A second assumption is that there is an objectively correct\nranking of the alternatives and the voters\u2019 rankings are noisy\nestimates of this ground truth. This way of thinking about the voting\nproblem was introduced by Condorcet and discussed in Section 4.3.\nProcaccia et al. (2016) import ideas from the theory of\nerror-correcting codes to develop an interesting new approach to\naggregate rankings viewed as noisy estimates of some ground truth.\n\n5. Concluding Remarks\n5.1 From Theory to Practice\n\nAs with any mathematical analysis of social phenomena, questions\nabound about the \u201creal-life\u201d implications of the\ntheoretical analysis of the voting methods given above. The main\nquestion is whether the voting paradoxes are simply features of the\nformal framework used to represent an election scenario or\nformalizations of real-life phenomena. This raises a number of subtle\nissues about the scope of mathematical modeling in the social\nsciences, many of which fall outside the scope of this article. I\nconclude with a brief discussion of two questions that shed some light\non how one should interpret the above analysis. \n\nHow likely is a Condorcet Paradox or any of the other\nvoting paradoxes?  There are two ways to approach this question.\nThe first is to calculate the probability that a majority cycle will\noccur in an election scenario. There is a sizable literature devoted\nto analytically deriving the probability of a majority cycle occurring\nin election scenarios of varying sizes (see Gehrlein 2006, and\nRegenwetter et al. 2006, for overviews of this literature).\nThe calculations depend on assumptions about the distribution of\nrankings among the voters. One distribution that is\ntypically used is the so-called impartial culture, where each\nranking is possible and occurs with equal probability. For\nexample, if there are three candidates, and it is assumed that the\nvoters\u2019 ballots are rankings of the candidates, then each possible ranking \ncan occur with probability 1/6. Under this assumption,\nthe probability of a majority cycle occurring has been calculated (see\nGehrlein 2006, for details). Riker (1982, p. 122) has a table of the\nrelevant calculations. Two observations about this data: First, as the\nnumber of candidates and voters increases, the probability of a\nmajority cycles increases to certainty. Second, for a fixed number of\ncandidates, the probability of a majority cycle still increases,\nthough not necessarily to certainty (the number of voters is the\nindependent variable here). For example, if there are five candidates\nand seven voters, then the probability of a majority cycle is 21.5\npercent. This probability increases to 25.1 percent as the number of\nvoters increases to infinity (keeping the number of candidates fixed)\nand to 100 percent as the number of candidates increases to infinity\n(keeping the number of voters fixed). Prima facie, this result\nsuggests that we should expect to see instances of the Condorcet and\nrelated paradoxes in large elections. Of course, this interpretation\ntakes it for granted that the impartial culture is a realistic\nassumption. Many authors have noted that the impartial culture is a\nsignificant idealization that almost certainly does not occur in\nreal-life elections. Tsetlin et al. (2003) go even further arguing\nthat the impartial culture is a worst-case scenario in the sense that\nany deviation results in lower probabilities of a majority\ncycle (see Regenwetter et al. 2006, for a complete discussion\nof this issue, and List and Goodin  2001, Appendix 3,  for a related result). \n\nA second way to argue that the above theoretical observations are\nrobust is to find supporting empirical evidence. For instance, is\nthere evidence that majority cycles have occurred in actual elections?\nWhile Riker (1982) offers a number of intriguing examples, the most\ncomprehensive analysis of the empirical evidence for majority cycles\nis provided by Mackie (2003, especially Chapters 14 and 15). The\nconclusion is that, in striking contrast to the probabilistic analysis\nreferenced above, majority cycles typically have not occurred in\nactual elections. However, this literature has not reached a consensus\nabout this issue (cf. Riker 1982): The problem is that the available\ndata typically does not include voters\u2019 opinions about all\npairwise comparison of candidates, which is needed to determine if\nthere is a majority cycle. So, this information must be\ninferred (for example, by using statistical methods) from the\ngiven data. \n\nA related line of research focuses on  the  influence of  factors, \nsuch as polls (Reijngoud and Endriss 2012), \nsocial networks (Santoro and Beck 2017, Stirling 2016) and deliberation \namong the voters (List 2018), on the profiles of ballots that are actually \nrealized  in an election.  For instance, List et al. 2013 has evidence \nsuggesting that deliberation reduces the probability of a Condorcet cycle occurring. \n\n\nHow do the different voting methods compare in actual elections?\n In this article, I have analyzed voting methods under highly\nidealized assumptions. But, in the end, we are interested in a very\npractical question: Which method should a group adopt? Of\ncourse, any answer to this question will depend on many factors that\ngo beyond the abstract analysis given above  (cf. Edelman 2012a). An interesting line of\nresearch focuses on incorporating empirical evidence into the\ngeneral theory of voting. Evidence can come in the form of a computer\nsimulation, a detailed analysis of a particular voting method in\nreal-life elections (for example, see Brams 2008, Chapter 1, which\nanalyzes Approval voting in practice), or as in situ\nexperiments in which voters are asked to fill in additional ballots\nduring an actual election (Laslier 2010, 2011). \n\nThe most striking results  can be found in the work of\nMichael Regenwetter and his colleagues. They have analyzed datasets\nfrom a variety of elections, showing that many of the usual voting\nmethods that are considered irreconcilable (e.g., Plurality Rule, Borda\nCount and the  Condorcet consistent methods from Section 3.1.1) are, in fact, in\nperfect agreement. This suggests that the \u201ctheoretical\nliterature may promote overly pessimistic views about the likelihood\nof consensus among consensus methods\u201d (Regenwetter et\nal. 2009, p. 840). See Regenwetter et al. 2006 for an\nintroduction to the methods used in these analyses and Regenwetter\net al. 2009 for the current state-of-the-art. \n\n5.2 Further Reading\n\nMy objective in this article has been to introduce different voting methods\nand to highlight key results and issues that facilitate comparisons\nbetween the voting methods. To dive more into the details of the\ntopics introduced in this article, see Saari 2001, 2008, Nurmi 1998,\nBrams and Fishburn 2002, Zwicker 2012, and the collection of articles\nin Felsenthal and Machover 2012. Some important topics related to the\nstudy of voting methods not discussed in this article include:\n\n Saari\u2019s influential geometric approach to study of voting methods\nand paradoxes (Saari 1995); \n The study of measures of voting power: the probability\nthat a single voter is decisive in an election (Gelman et al. 2002;\nFelsenthal and Machover 1998); \nThe study of probabilistic voting methods: a voting\nmethod in which the output is a lottery over the set of candidates\nrather than a ranking or set of candidates (Brandt 2017); \n Questions about whether it is rational to vote in an election\n(Brennan 2016); and \n The study of methods for ensuring fair and proportional\nrepresentation (Balinksi and Young 1982; Pukelsheim 2017). \n\nFinally, consult List 2013 and Morreau 2014 for a discussion of\nbroader issues in theory of social choice.
