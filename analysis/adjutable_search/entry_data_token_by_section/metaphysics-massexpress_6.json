    "main_text": "Stuff as a Special Kind of Thing or Things || Concrete Mass Expressions Refer to Sets\n2.2 Concrete Mass Expressions Refer to Sets\n\nA slightly less popular way to answer our question is to treat mass\nexpressions as referring to sets. For instance, suppose there\u2019s\nsome wine on the floor. Roughly, according to the masses-as-sets\ntheorist, this is equivalent to there being a set of wine bits\n(whatever they are) on the floor. If Nancy\u2019s ring is gold, then\nthere is a set of gold molecules which compose or constitute the ring.\nIf \u2018the gold\u2019 is identified with a set, then some problems\nfaced by the mereologists are avoided. While a mereologist who is\ncommitted to the existence of the mass of gold is under pressure to\ndeny the existence of the ring if she wants to avoid coincidence, the\nmasses-as-sets theorist has a great advantage in that she can say that\nboth the ring and gold exist but are not coinciding material things,\nsince the gold, unlike the ring, is a set and not an object.\n\nThe masses-as-sets theorist reduces mass expressions to count\nexpressions, by treating concrete mass expressions (e.g., \u2018the\ngold\u2019) as veiled count-expressions (e.g., \u2018the set of gold\natoms\u2019).\n\nOne stark problem for the masses-as-sets view (henceforth we will\nidentify a proponent of this view as a \u2018set theorist,\u2019\nignoring its more general meaning), is that it identifies\nparadigmatically concrete stuffs with what are usually regarded as\nparadigmatically abstract objects\u2014sets. How could some gold be a\nset? Suppose we can pick out a definite portion of gold which makes up\na ring. If sets are abstract, then the set theorist must say that the\ngold is abstract. This is pretty hard to swallow. Abstract things are\nnot in time or space, but gold is. Also, sets are not identical to\ntheir members. But the gold in the ring does seem identical\nto the members of the set of gold atoms, not the set itself.\n(Regarding issues of \u2018many-one identity\u2019, see Baxter 1988,\nWallace 2011a,b, and see\n section 8 of the entry on identity).\n\nPerhaps the set theorist can instead maintain that masses are sets,\nbut deny that sets (or at least sets of bits of matter) are abstract.\nA set theorist might maintain that sets of physical objects (such as\ngold atoms) can be said to be in space in virtue of their members\nbeing in space. The gold, construed as a set of gold atoms, can be\nsaid to weigh ten ounces in virtue of its members collectively\nweighing ten ounces. On this kind of view, massy sets have their\nphysical properties \u2018by proxy\u2019 (Zimmerman 1995, sections 3\nand 9).\n\nBut, when we try to unpack exactly in which sense the set of gold\natoms is non-abstract, we can see that it is hard to distinguish the\nmasses-as-sets view from the plurals approach which we will examine\nbelow. The non-abstract set theorist will hold that a set of gold\natoms can in fact have physical properties, in virtue of the\nproperties of its members. So, a non-abstract set theorist would first\nparaphrase \u201cthe gold weighs ten ounces\u201d into \u201cthat\nset of gold atoms weighs ten ounces.\u201d But, in order to explain\nhow a set weighs ten ounces, they would have to again paraphrase and\nanalyze the latter as something like \u201cthe set\u2019s\nmembers collectively weigh ten ounces.\u201d But if the set\ntheorist has to paraphrase their paraphrase, then there is\nconsiderable pressure for the set theorist to instead switch over to\nthe stuff-as-plurals view (section\n 2.3)\n and just talk directly about the members. If we are just talking\nabout the members, or the gold atoms, and we can say what we want\nabout many things without talking about the set of those many things,\nthen why complicate matters by introducing sets?\n\nThere are some problems for the set-theoretic paraphrase. Suppose one\ntruly says \u201cthe melted sugar here is the same sugar that was in\nthe packet.\u201d If \u2018sugar\u2019 in this context referred to\nthe various lumps and grains of sugar in a packet, then, if there are\nno more lumps or grains after the melting, then the set-equality, and\nhence the identity-claim, comes out false. As Pelletier points out,\nwhen we identify some stuff, there are many different individuating\nstandards available (e.g., \u2018packets of ___\u2019,\n\u2018bottles of ___\u2019, \u2018granules of ___\u2019), and\ndifferent divisions will yield different sets (1974, p.\u200994).\nThis ends up either under-determining which identities hold, or,\nabsurdly, entailing that some stuff is distinct from itself.\n\nIn addition, set theorists usually formulate their theory in terms\nassuming atomism, yet it seems possible that there is gunky non-atomic\nstuff (Zimmerman 1995, \u00a79, 1996b; Sider 1993). If there are, or\ncould be, stuffs like this, then standard set-theoretic treatments\nwill not work, since such theories require all sets to be\nwell-founded. Another problem is that for some stuffs it is (or seems\nto be) indeterminate what, if anything, will count as a smallest unit\nof it\u2014e.g., minestrone soup or beer. So, the set theorist has a\nproblem with non-atomic or fuzzy atomless stuffs (see\n 1.4\n for terminology). In what immediately follows, we will only discuss\nthe issue of non-atomicity.\n\nSuppose there is a cube of completely homogenous and gunky jello on\nthe table, with no empty space inside. Suppose that the cube\ncan\u2019t survive being sliced or having its parts scattered.\nSuppose that the jello composing the cube is a fundamental stuff-kind.\nOn the set-theoretic proposal, to say that the jello constitutes the\ncube is to say that a set of jello-individuals constitutes the cube.\nWhich individuals? One non-option is the set {cube}, for then the\njello would be identical with the cube, and could not undergo any\nchanges which the cube could not. So, the set must include at least\ntwo jello individuals. Suppose that the set\u2019s members are the\nleft and right halves of the jello\u2014call them \u2018Lefty\u2019\nand \u2018Righty\u2019. So, saying that the jello constitutes the\ncube is to say that {Lefty, Righty} constitute the cube. But, of\ncourse, there is also the set of Lefty\u2019s left half, right half,\nand Righty\u2019s left and right halves. This set, {Lefty\u2019s\nleft half, Lefty\u2019s right half, Righty\u2019s left half,\nRighty\u2019s right half}, is a better candidate to identify with the\njello stuff, since it will survive if cut into four pieces the right\nway, whereas {Lefty, Righty} will not. We want to pick out the set of\njello-individuals which can survive any kind of scattering. But, the\nproblem, of course, is that Lefty\u2019s left half is composed of\nLefty\u2019s left half\u2019s left half, and so on. Since the\npostulation of gunk rules out employing a set of point-particles,\nthere appears to be no set of jello-individuals that we can\nidentify the jello stuff with which can serve to pick out all the\njello stuff and account for the persistence conditions of the\nstuff (=set) in the right way. So, there is absolutely\nnothing which is the set of individuals which make\nup the cube. If we wish to identify the jello stuff with every set\nthat is some of it, since the members of every set are themselves\ncomposed of further sets, then it is sets \u2018all the way\ndown\u2019, where we never arrive at members which are not composed\nof further members of sets of stuff. Dean Zimmerman notes,\n\nThe mere thought of these \u201cnon-well-founded\u201d sets is\nenough to induce vertigo. How could something as concrete and physical\nas a mass of matter be made of nothing but sets of sets of\nsets\u2026ad infinitum? (1995, p.\u200999, italics his)\n\n\nFor masses of stuff composed of simples, however, the procedure is\nrelatively simple\u2014\u201cwhenever you have a larger mass\ncompounded out of smaller masses of the same kind, identify the larger\nmass with a set of these smaller masses.\u201d There is no way to do\nthis with gunky masses, since, for any arbitrarily chosen constituting\nindividual, it itself is a constituted object that needs to have the\nsame treatment applied to it.\n\nThe set-theoretical interpretation has many difficulties, and few\nchampions. But, this should not be regarded as the last word on the\nsubject. There are non-well-founded set theories, which could perhaps\nget around the foregoing difficulties.\n",
