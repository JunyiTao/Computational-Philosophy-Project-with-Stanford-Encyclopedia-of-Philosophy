    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Utilitarianism || Reconciling the Elements\n2.4 Reconciling the Elements\n\nWhere exactly does this recognition of perfectionist elements in\nMill\u2019s conception of happiness leave us? Any interpretation\nfaces significant worries about his consistency. Part of the problem\nis that Mill appears to endorse three distinct conceptions of the good\nand happiness.\n\nHedonism: Pleasure is the one and only intrinsic good,\nthings are good insofar as they are pleasant, and happiness consists\nin pleasure.\nDesire-satisfaction: The one and only intrinsic good is\nthe satisfaction of desire (actual or idealized), things are good\ninsofar as they satisfy desire, and happiness consists in the\nsatisfaction of desire.\nPerfectionism: The exercise of one\u2019s higher\ncapacities is the one and only intrinsic good, things are good insofar\nas they exercise higher capacities, and happiness consists in the\nexercise of higher capacities.\n\n\nHedonism is apparently introduced in the Proportionality Doctrine,\nwhen Mill identifies happiness and pleasure (U II 2). In\nintroducing the doctrine of higher pleasures, Mill appears to want to\nmake some refinement within hedonism (II 3\u20135). But the higher\npleasures doctrine appeals to the informed or idealized preferences of\na competent judge and identifies higher pleasures with the object of\ntheir preferences (II 5). Moreover, he treats this appeal to the\npreferences of competent judges as final (II 8). But competent judges\nprefer higher activities, and not just subjective pleasures caused by\nthose activities, and their preference for higher pursuits is based on\ntheir sense of the dignity inherent in a life lived that way (II 6).\nMoreover, in On Liberty and elsewhere he embraces a\n\u201cprogressive\u201d conception of happiness in terms of\nreflective self-examination and directive self-control. Since these\nare three distinct and rival claims about Mill\u2019s conception of\nthe final good, any reading must explain away inconsistency as best it\ncan and say something about how these three elements are to be\nreconciled with one another.\n\nWe could reconcile either hedonism or perfectionism with the\ndesire-satisfaction claim if we treat the latter as a metaethical\nclaim about what makes good things good and the former as a\nsubstantive claim about what things are good. On this reading, what\nmakes something good is that it would be preferred by competent\njudges, and what competent judges in fact prefer is pleasures,\nespecially higher pleasures (according to the hedonist claim) or\nhigher activities and pursuits (according to the perfectionist claim).\nBut, as we have seen, neither of these claims can accommodate all of\nMill\u2019s claims about happiness, and both assume that the\npreferences of competent judges are constitutive of the superiority of\nthe object of the their preferences. But the dignity passage implies\nthat the preferences of competent judges are evidential, rather than\nconstitutive, of the value of the object of the their preferences.\n\nThe perfectionist reading offers one reconciliation of Mill\u2019s\ndisparate claims. It says that happiness consists in the exercise of\nhigher capacities, that the preferences of competent judges are\nevidential of superior value, and that higher pleasures are objective\npleasures. There is no doubt that his initial formulation of his\nconception of happiness in terms of pleasure misleadingly leads us to\nexpect greater continuity between his own brand of utilitarianism and\nthe hedonistic utilitarianism of the Radicals than we actually find.\nHowever, this perfectionist interpretation seems to afford the most\nconsistent reading of Mill\u2019s disparate claims about happiness\n(also see Saunders 2017).\n",
