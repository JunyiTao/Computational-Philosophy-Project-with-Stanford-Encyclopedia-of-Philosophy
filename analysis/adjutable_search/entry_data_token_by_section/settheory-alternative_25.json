    "main_text": "Small Set Theories || Pocket set theory\n9.1 Pocket set theory\n\nThis theory is a proposal of ours, which elaborates on a suggestion of\nRudy Rucker. We (and many others) have observed that of all the orders\nof infinity in Cantor\u2019s paradise, only two actually occur in\nclassical mathematical practice outside set theory: these are\n\\(\\aleph_0\\) and \\(c\\), the infinity of the natural numbers and the\ninfinity of the continuum. Pocket set theory is a theory motivated by\nthe idea that these are the only infinities (Vopenka\u2019s\nalternative set theory also has this property, by the way).\n\nThe objects of pocket set theory are classes. A class is said to be a\nset iff it is an element (as in the usual class theories over\nZFC).\n\nThe ordered pair is defined using the usual Kuratowski definition, but\nwithout assuming that there are any ordered pairs. The notions of\nrelation, function, bijection and equinumerousness are defined as\nusual (still without any assumptions as to the existence of any\nordered pairs). An infinite set is defined as a set which is\nequinumerous with one of its proper subsets. A proper class is defined\nas a class which is not a set.\n\nThe axioms of pocket set theory are\n\n\nExtensionality: Classes with the same elements are\nequal.\n\nClass Comprehension: For any formula \\(\\phi\\), there\nis a class \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi(x)\\}\\) which contains all sets \\(x\\) such\nthat \\(\\phi(x)\\). (note that this is the class comprehension axiom of\nKelley-Morse set theory, without any restrictions on quantifiers in\n\\(\\phi)\\).\n\nInfinite Sets: There is an infinite set; all infinite\nsets are the same size.\n\nProper Classes: All proper classes are the same size,\nand any class the same size as a proper class is proper.\n\n\nWe cannot resist proving the main results (because the proofs are\nfunny).\n\n\nEmpty Set: If the empty set were a proper class, then\nall proper classes would be empty. In particular, the Russell class\nwould be empty. Let \\(I\\) be an infinite set. \\(\\{I\\}\\) would be a\nset, because it is not empty, and \\(\\{I,\\{I\\}\\}\\) would be a set\n(again because it is not empty). But \\(\\{I,\\{I\\}\\}\\) belongs to the\nRussell class (as a set with two elements, it cannot be either the\nDedekind infinite \\(I\\) or the singleton \\(\\{I\\}\\). So \\(\\varnothing\\)\nis a set.\n\nSingleton: If any singleton \\(\\{x\\}\\) is a proper\nclass, then all singletons are proper classes, and the Russell class\nis a singleton. \\(\\{I, \\varnothing \\}\\) is a set (both elements are\nsets, and the class is not a singleton) which cannot be a member of\nitself, and so is in the Russell class. But so is \\(\\varnothing\\) in\nthe Russell class; so the Russell class is not a singleton, and all\nsingletons are sets.\n\nUnordered Pair: The Russell class is not a pair,\nbecause it has distinct elements \\(\\varnothing , \\{\\varnothing \\},\n\\{\\{\\varnothing \\}\\}\\).\n\nRelations: All Kuratowski ordered pairs exist, so all\ndefinable relations are realized as set relations.\n\n\nCantor\u2019s theorem (no set is the same size as the class of its\nsubsets) and the Schr\u00f6der-Bernstein theorem (if there are\ninjections from each of two classes into the other, there is a\nbijection between them) have their standard proofs.\n\nThe Russell class can be shown to be the same size as the universe\nusing Schr\u00f6der-Bernstein: the injection from \\(R\\) into \\(V\\) is\nobvious, and \\(V\\) can be embedded into \\(R\\) using the map \\(x\n\\mapsto \\{\\{x\\}, \\varnothing \\}\\) (clearly no set \\(\\{\\{x\\},\n\\varnothing \\}\\) belongs to itself). So a class is proper iff it is\nthe same size as the universe (limitation of size).\n\nDefine the von Neumann ordinals as classes which are strictly\nwell-ordered by membership. Each finite ordinal can be proved to be a\nset (because it is smaller than its successor and is a subclass of the\nRussell class). The class of all ordinals is not a set (but is the\nlast ordinal), for the usual reasons, and so is the same size as the\nuniverse, and so the universe can be well-ordered.\n\nThere is an infinite ordinal, because there is an ordinal which can be\nplaced in one-to-one correspondence with one\u2019s favorite infinite\nset \\(I\\). Since there is an infinite ordinal, every finite ordinal is\na set and the first infinite ordinal \\(\\omega\\) is a set. It follows\nthat all infinite sets are countably infinite.\n\nThe power set of an infinite set \\(I\\) is not the same size as \\(I\\)\nby Cantor\u2019s theorem, is certainly infinite, and so cannot be a\nset, and so must be the same size as the universe. It follows by usual\nconsiderations that the universe is the same size as \\(\\wp(\\omega)\\)\nor as \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) (the set of real numbers, defined in any of the\nusual ways), and its \u201ccardinal\u201d is \\(c\\). Further, the\nfirst uncountable ordinal \\(\\omega_1\\) is the cardinality of the\nuniverse, so the Continuum Hypothesis holds.\n\nIt is well-known that coding tricks allow one to do classical\nmathematics without ever going above cardinality \\(c\\): for example,\nthe class of all functions from the reals to the reals, is\ntoo large to be even a proper class here, but the class of\ncontinuous functions is of cardinality \\(c\\). An individual\ncontinuous function \\(f\\) might seem to be a proper class, but it can\nbe coded as a hereditarily countable set by (for example) letting the\ncountable set of pairs of rationals \\(\\langle p, q\\rangle\\) such that\n\\(p \\lt f(q)\\) code the function \\(f\\). In fact, it is claimed that\nmost of classical mathematics can be carried out using just natural\nnumbers and sets of natural numbers (second-order arithmetic) or in\neven weaker systems, so pocket set theory (having the strength of\nthird order arithmetic) can be thought to be rather\ngenerous.\n\nWe do remark that it is not necessarily the case that the hypothetical\nadvocate of pocket set theory thinks that the universe is small; he or\nshe might instead think that the continuum is very large\u2026\n",
