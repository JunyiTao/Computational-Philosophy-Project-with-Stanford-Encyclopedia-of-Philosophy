    "main_text": "Alternative Conceptions of Justification || Meta-induction\n6. Living with Inductive Skepticism\n\nSo far we have considered the various ways in which we might attempt\nto solve the problem of induction by resisting one or other premise of\nHume\u2019s argument. Some philosophers have however seen his\nargument as unassailable, and have thus accepted that it does lead to\ninductive skepticism, the conclusion that inductive inferences cannot\nbe justified. The challenge then is to find a way of living with such\na radical-seeming conclusion. We appear to rely on inductive inference\nubiquitously in daily life, and it is also generally thought that it\nis at the very foundation of the scientific method. Can we go on with\nall this, whilst still seriously thinking none of it is justified by\nany rational argument?\n\nOne option here is to argue, as does Nicholas Maxwell, that the\nproblem of induction is posed in an overly restrictive context.\nMaxwell argues that the problem does not arise if we adopt a different\nconception of science than the \u2018standard empiricist\u2019 one,\nwhich he denotes \u2018aim-oriented empiricism\u2019 (Maxwell\n2017).\n\nAnother option here is to think that the significance of the problem\nof induction is somehow restricted to a skeptical context. Hume\nhimself seems to have thought along these lines. For instance he\nsays:\n\n\nNature will always maintain her rights, and prevail in the end over\nany abstract reasoning whatsoever. Though we should conclude, for\ninstance, as in the foregoing section, that, in all reasonings from\nexperience, there is a step taken by the mind, which is not supported\nby any argument or process of the understanding; there is no danger,\nthat these reasonings, on which almost all knowledge depends, will\never be affected by such a discovery. (E. 5.1.2)\n\n\nHume\u2019s purpose is clearly not to argue that we should not make\ninductive inferences in everyday life, and indeed his whole method and\nsystem of describing the mind in naturalistic terms depends on\ninductive inferences through and through. The problem of induction\nthen must be seen as a problem that arises only at the level of\nphilosophical reflection.\n\nAnother way to mitigate the force of inductive skepticism is to\nrestrict its scope. Karl Popper, for instance, regarded the problem of\ninduction as insurmountable, but he argued that science is not in fact\nbased on inductive inferences at all (Popper 1935 [1959]). Rather he\npresented a deductivist view of science, according to which it\nproceeds by making bold conjectures, and then attempting to falsify\nthose conjectures. In the simplest version of this account, when a\nhypothesis makes a prediction which is found to be false in an\nexperiment, the hypothesis is rejected as falsified. The logic of this\nprocedure is fully deductive. The hypothesis entails the prediction,\nand the falsity of the prediction refutes the hypothesis by modus\ntollens. Thus, Popper claimed that science was not based on the\nextrapolative inferences considered by Hume. The consequence then is\nthat it is not so important, at least for science, if those inferences\nwould lack a rational foundation.\n\nPopper\u2019s account appears to be incomplete in an important way.\nThere are always many hypotheses which have not yet been refuted by\nthe evidence, and these may contradict one another. According to the\nstrictly deductive framework, since none are yet falsified, they are\nall on an equal footing. Yet, scientists will typically want to say\nthat one is better supported by the evidence than the others. We seem\nto need more than just deductive reasoning to support practical\ndecision-making (Salmon 1981). Popper did indeed appeal to a notion of\none hypothesis being better or worse \u201ccorroborated\u201d by the\nevidence. But arguably, this took him away from a strictly deductive\nview of science. It appears doubtful then that pure deductivism can\ngive an adequate account of scientific method.\n",
