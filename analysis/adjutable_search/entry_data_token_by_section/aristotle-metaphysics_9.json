    "main_text": "Substances and Universals\n10. Substances and Universals\n\nAt this point, we seem to have a clear idea about the nature of\nsubstantial form as Aristotle conceives of it. A substantial form is\nthe essence of a substance, and it corresponds to a species. Since it\nis an essence, a substantial form is what is denoted by the definiens\nof a definition. Since only universals are definable, substantial\nforms are universals. That substantial forms are universals is\nconfirmed by Aristotle\u2019s comment, at the end of \u0396.8, that\n\u201cSocrates and Callias \u2026 are distinct because of their\nmatter \u2026 but the same in form\u201d\n(1034a6\u20138). For them to be the same in form is for\nthem to have the same form, i.e., for one and the same substantial\nform to be predicated of two different clumps of matter. And being\n\u201cpredicated of many\u201d is what makes something a universal\n(De Interpretatione 17a37).\n\nBut \u0396.13 throws our entire understanding into disarray. Aristotle\nbegins by returning to the candidates for the title of ousia\nintroduced in \u0396.3, and points out that having now discussed the\nclaims of the subject and the essence, it is time to consider the\nthird candidate, the universal. But the remainder of the chapter\nconsists of a barrage of arguments to the conclusion that universals\nare not substances.\n\n\u0396.13 therefore produces a fundamental tension in\nAristotle\u2019s metaphysics that has fragmented his interpreters.\nSome maintain that Aristotle\u2019s theory is ultimately\ninconsistent, on the grounds that it is committed to all three of the\nfollowing propositions:\n\n\n\n\n(i)\nSubstance is form. \n\n(ii)\nForm is universal. \n\n(iii)\nNo universal is a substance.  \n\n\n\nOthers have provided interpretations according to which Aristotle does\nnot maintain all of (i)\u2013(iii), and there is a considerable\nvariety of such interpretations, too many to be canvassed here. But\nthere are two main, and opposed, lines of interpretation. According to\none, Aristotle\u2019s substantial forms are not universals after all,\nbut each belongs exclusively to the particular whose form it is, and\nthere are therefore as many substantial forms of a given kind as there\nare particulars of that kind. According to the other,\nAristotle\u2019s arguments in \u0396.13 are not intended to show that\nno universal is a substance, tout court, but some weaker\nthesis that is compatible with there being only one substantial form\nfor all of the particulars belonging to the same species. Proponents\nof particular forms (or essences) include Sellars 1957, Harter 1975,\nHartman 1977, Irwin 1988, and Witt 1989b. Opponents include Woods\n1967, Owen 1978, Code 1986, Loux 1991, and Lewis 1991.\n\nIt would be foolish to attempt to resolve this issue within the\nconfines of the present entry, as it is perhaps the largest, and most\ndisputed, single interpretative issue concerning Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics. we will, instead, mention some of the main\nconsiderations brought up on each side of this dispute, and give our\nreasons for thinking that substantial forms are universals.\n\nThe idea that substantial forms are particulars is supported by\nAristotle\u2019s claims that a substance is \u201cseparable and this\nsomething \u201d (ch\u00f4riston kai tode ti, \u0396.3),\nthat there are no universals apart from their particulars (\u0396.13),\nand that universals are not substances (\u0396.13). On the other side,\nthe idea that substantial forms are universals is supported by\nAristotle\u2019s claims that substances are, par excellence,\nthe definable entities (\u0396.4), that definition is of the universal\n(\u0396.11), and that it is impossible to define particulars\n(\u0396.15).\n\nIn our opinion, the indefinability of particulars makes it impossible\nfor substantial forms to be particulars. If there were a substantial\nform that is unique to some sensible particular, say Callias, then the\ndefinition corresponding to that form, or essence, would apply\nuniquely to Callias\u2014it would define him, which is precisely what\nAristotle says cannot be done. The question, then, is whether the\nevidence against substantial forms being universals can be countered.\nThis is less clear, but the following considerations are relevant. (1)\nAristotle\u2019s claim that a substantial form is an individual\n(tode ti) does not exclude its being a universal\n(katholou). Universals are contrasted with particulars\n(kath\u2019 hekasta), not individuals (although Aristotle\ndoes sometimes ignore the distinction between tode ti and\nkath\u2019 hekaston). What makes something a tode\nti is its being a fully determinate thing, not further\ndifferentiable; what makes something a kath\u2019 hekaston\nis its being a particular thing, unrepeatable, and not predicated of\nanything else. There is thus the possibility of a universal tode\nti\u2014a fully determinate universal not further divisible into\nlower-level universals, but predicated of numerous particulars. (2)\nThe claim that there are no universals apart from particulars needs to\nbe understood in context. When Aristotle asserts (1038b33)\nthat \u201cthere is not some animal \u2026 beyond the particular\nones (ta tina)\u201d he is just as likely to be referring to\nthe particular kinds of animals as he is to particular\nspecimens. If so, his point may be that a generic kind, such as\nanimal, is ontologically dependent on its species, and hence on the\nsubstantial forms that are the essences of those species. (3) The\narguments of \u0396.13 against the substantiality of universals are\npresented as part of a give-and-take investigation of the perplexities\ninvolved in the notion of substantial form. It is not clear,\ntherefore, whether the blanket claim \u201cNo universal is a\nsubstance\u201d is intended to be accepted without qualification.\nIndeed, a closer examination of the arguments may show that\nqualifications are required if the arguments are to be cogent. For\nexample, the argument at 1038b11\u201315 is based on the\npremise that the substance of x is peculiar (idion)\nto x. It then draws the conclusion that a universal cannot be\nthe substance of all of its instances (for it could not be\nidion to all of them), and concludes that it must be the\nsubstance \u201cof none.\u201d But note that this conclusion does\nnot say that no universal can be a substance, but only that no\nuniversal can be the substance of any of its instances (cf. Code\n1978). Aristotle\u2019s point may be that since form is predicated of\nmatter, a substantial form is predicated of various clumps of matter.\nBut it is not the substance of those clumps of matter, for it is\npredicated accidentally of them. The thing with which it is uniquely\ncorrelated, and of which it is the substance, is not one of its\ninstances, but is the substantial form itself. This\nconclusion should not be surprising in light of Aristotle\u2019s\nclaim in \u0396.6 that \u201ceach substance is one and the same as\nits essence.\u201d A universal substantial form just is that\nessence.\n",
