    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\n\nSextus Empiricus was a Pyrrhonian Skeptic living probably in the\nsecond or third century CE, many of whose works survive, including the\nOutlines of Pyrrhonism, which is the best and fullest account\nwe have of Pyrrhonian skepticism. (Book I of that work consists of\nSextus\u2019 codification of the nature of Pyrrhonian skepticism,\nwhich he contrasts with the outlooks of other schools of philosophy.)\nFittingly, we know little or nothing about the life of Sextus\nEmpiricus, including when and where he lived. Best estimates put him\nanywhere between 100 CE and the first half of the third century CE\n(House 1980), but it has been suggested that he was already well known\nby the end of the second century (Barnes 2000: xii). Sextus is called\n\u2018Empiricus\u2019 because he belonged to the Empirical School of\nMedicine (Deichgr\u00e4ber 1965: 40\u20131). There were three main schools\nof medicine, the Rationalists, the Empiricists, and the Methodists.\nConfusingly, even though Sextus was an Empiricist, he actually states\nin Outlines of Pyrrhonism I 236 that while Pyrrhonism is very\nsimilar to the Empirical School of Medicine, Pyrrhonists \u2018might\nrather adopt\u2019 Methodism. This is a standing puzzle for\ninterpreters of Sextus (see\n section 3.7 below).\n",
