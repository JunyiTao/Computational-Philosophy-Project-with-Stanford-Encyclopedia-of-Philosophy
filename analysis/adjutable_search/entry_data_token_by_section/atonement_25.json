    "main_text": "Collective Atonement\n7. Feminist and Womanist Approaches to Atonement\n\nFeminist and womanist scholars have argued that our understanding of\natonement needs to be transformed by an awareness that (i) women\nthroughout history in many cultures have suffered many wrongs while\ntheir culture ignored or belittled their need for atonement/amends,\nwhile at the same time (ii) in many cultures women have born the\nburden of repairing moral fragmentation that happens in households\n(Spelman 2002: 26ff). As a result, women have faced a sort of\noppression in relation to atonement: they are held responsible for\nhelping make amends for other peoples\u2019 (often men\u2019s)\nwrongs, while their own need for atonement is sidelined. Many feminist\nand womanist theologians and philosophers have argued that these\nfacts, and others grounded in women\u2019s experiences, are grounds\nfor critique of traditional theories of the Christian doctrine of\natonement.\n\nTanner (2010: 249f) observes that several feminist criticisms are in\nline with other standard criticisms in the history of theological\nargument. Some question the character of God as depicted in the\nclassic atonement theories. J. Brown and Parker (1989) argue the\nclassic theories endorse divine child abuse, as Christ, the son of\nGod, suffers terribly at the Father\u2019s will for the sake of\nothers and their actions. Others question the mechanism of\natonement\u2014for instance, D. Williams (1991) argues that black\nwomen in America have historically had terrible experiences of coerced\nand voluntary surrogacy, acting as surrogate parents and household\nmanagers for white folks, performing field work, and providing sexual\npleasure to male slaveholders. Many traditional theories treat Christ\nas a substitute, or surrogate, who atones for human sin. The\nexperience of black women shows that even voluntary surrogacy is not\nnecessarily a great good.\n\nHowever, feminist and womanist critiques extend beyond the classic\ncritiques. One of their core claims is that\n\n\ntheologies of the cross are seen to be complicit in the oppression,\nvictimization and disempowerment of women. (Keshgegian 2000: 476; see\nalso Buck 2020)\n\n\nD. Williams suggests that\n\n\nthe image of the surrogate-God\u2026supports and reinforces the\nexploitation that has accompanied [black women\u2019s] experience\nwith surrogacy. (1991: 9)\n\n\nBrock and Parker (2001) present many stories of women who have\nsuffered from abuse and neglect at the hands of a partner and were\ntold by church members to endure the suffering\u2014even rejoice in\nit\u2014as it brings them closer to Christ who suffered on the\ncross.\n\n\nIf one extols the silent and freely-chosen suffering of Christ, who\nwas \u201cobedient unto death\u201d (Philippians 2:8), as an example\nto be imitated by all those victimized by patriarchal\noppression\u2026one not only legitimates but also enables acts of\nviolence against women and children. (Fiorenza 1994: 106)\n\n\nThis can in turn lead to a sort of hermeneutical injustice wherein\nwomen and other oppressed people are hindered from seeing that\nresisting injustice and standing up for one\u2019s own well-being are\npermissible and noble (Pogin 2020).\n\nIn response to these critiques, some endorse forms of the Christus\nVictor theory that treat Christ\u2019s death as a tragedy, not as an\nintrinsically redemptive act (Ray 1998; Weaver 2001), while others\nendorse a version of participation theory (Tanner 2010) on which\nChrist\u2019s divine life-giving power deeply manifest on the cross\nand humans can receive a share of that power through union with\nChrist. Some have defended Anselm\u2019s theory against the critiques\n(Keshgegian 2000). Some argue that a full appreciation of the doctrine\nof the Trinity can help evade some of the critiques (Crisp 2020).\n\nGu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir (2010; 2017) argues that some of the\ncritiques do not adequately distinguish between theology being abused\nand theology being essentially abusive. She thinks when a theology of\nthe cross glorifies suffering per se, theology is being abused.\nHowever, a theology of the cross\u2014and an account of\natonement\u2014need not be essentially abusive if it embraces the\nidea that suffering and death can be transformed into joy and life and\noffers hope of a better life to those who suffer unjustly.\n\nOne thing the feminist and womanist critiques show is that there is\nneed for further reflection on how the Christian doctrine of the\natonement ought to integrate with and impact human practices of\natonement.
