    "main_text": "Theoretical Approaches || Concepts\n4.3 Concepts\n\nConcepts, which partly correspond to the words in spoken and written\nlanguage, are an important kind of mental representation. There are\ncomputational and psychological reasons for abandoning the classical\nview that concepts have strict definitions. Instead, concepts can be\nviewed as sets of typical features. Concept application is then a\nmatter of getting an approximate match between concepts and the world.\nSchemas and scripts are more complex than concepts that correspond to\nwords, but they are similar in that they consist of bundles of\nfeatures that can be matched and applied to new situations. The\nexplanatory schema used in concept-based systems is:\n\nExplanatory target:\n\nWhy do people have a particular kind of intelligent behavior?\n Explanation pattern:\n\nPeople have a set of concepts, organized via kind and part\nhierarchies and other associations.\nPeople have a set of procedures for concept application, including\nspreading activation, matching, and inheritance.\nThe procedures applied to the concepts produce the behavior.\nConcepts can be translated into rules, but they bundle information\ndifferently than sets of rules, making possible different\ncomputational procedures.\n\n (See the entry on\n concepts.)\n \n",
