    "main_text": "What is Scientific Realism? || Qualifications and Variations\n1.3 Qualifications and Variations\n\nThe general recipe for realism just described is accurate so far as it\ngoes, but still falls short of the degree of precision offered by most\nrealists. The two main sources of imprecision thus far are found in\nthe general recipe itself, which makes reference to the idea of\n\u201cour best scientific theories\u201d and the notion of\n\u201capproximate truth\u201d. The motivation for these\nqualifications is perhaps clear. If one is to defend a positive\nepistemic attitude regarding scientific theories, it is presumably\nsensible to do so not merely in connection with any theory (especially\nwhen one considers that, over the long history of the sciences up to\nthe present, some theories were not or are not especially successful),\nbut rather with respect to theories (or aspects of theories,\nas we will see momentarily) that would appear, prima facie,\nto merit such a defense, viz. our best theories (or aspects\nthereof). And it is widely held, not least by realists, that even many\nof our best scientific theories are likely false, strictly speaking,\nhence the importance of the notion that theories may be \u201cclose\nto\u201d the truth (that is, approximately true) even though they are\nfalse. The challenge of making these qualifications more precise,\nhowever, is significant, and has generated much discussion.\n\nConsider first the issue of how best to identify those theories that\nrealists should be realists about. A general disclaimer is in order\nhere: realists are generally fallibilists, holding that realism is\nappropriate in connection with our best theories even though they\nlikely cannot be proven with absolute certainty; some of our best\ntheories could conceivably turn out to be significantly mistaken, but\nrealists maintain that, granting this possibility, there are grounds\nfor realism nonetheless. These grounds are bolstered by restricting\nthe domain of theories suitable for realist commitment to those that\nare sufficiently mature and non-ad hoc (Worrall 1989:\n153\u2013154; Psillos 1999: 105\u2013108). Maturity may be thought\nof in terms of the well established nature of the field in which a\ntheory is developed, or the duration of time a theory has survived, or\nits survival in the face of significant testing; and the condition of\nbeing non-ad hoc is intended to guard against theories that\nare \u201ccooked up\u201d (that is, posited merely) in order to\naccount for some known observations in the absence of rigorous\ntesting. On these construals, however, both the notion of maturity and\nthe notion of being non-ad hoc are admittedly vague. One\nstrategy for adding precision here is to attribute these qualities to\ntheories that make successful, novel predictions. The ability of a\ntheory to do this, it is commonly argued, marks it as genuinely\nempirically successful, and the sort of theory to which realists\nshould be more inclined to commit (Musgrave 1988; Lipton 1990; Leplin\n1997; White 2003; Hitchcock & Sober 2004; Barnes 2008; for a\ndissenting view, see Harker 2008; cf. Alai 2014).\n\nThe idea that with the development of the sciences over time, theories\nare converging on (\u201cmoving in the direction of\u201d,\n\u201cgetting closer to\u201d) the truth, is a common theme in\nrealist discussions of theory change (for example, Hardin &\nRosenberg 1982 and Putnam 1982). Talk of approximate truth is often\ninvoked in this context and has produced a significant amount of often\nhighly technical work, conceptualizing the approximation of truth as\nsomething that can be quantified, such that judgments of relative\napproximate truth (of one proposition or theory in comparison to\nanother) can be formalized and given precise definitions. This work\nprovides one possible means by which to consider the convergentist\nclaim that theories can be viewed as increasingly approximately true\nover time, and this possibility is further considered in\n section 3.4.\n\nA final and especially important qualification to the general recipe\nfor realism described above comes in the form of a number of\nvariations. These species of generic realism can be viewed as falling\ninto three families or camps: explanationist realism; entity realism;\nand structural realism. There is a shared principle of speciation\nhere, in that all three approaches are attempts to identify more\nspecifically the component parts of scientific theories that are most\nworthy of epistemic commitment. Explanationism recommends\nrealist commitment with respect to those parts of our best\ntheories\u2014regarding (unobservable) entities, laws,\netc.\u2014that are in some sense indispensable or otherwise important\nto explaining their empirical success\u2014for instance, components\nof theories that are crucial in order to derive successful, novel\npredictions. Entity realism is the view that under conditions\nin which one can demonstrate impressive causal knowledge of a putative\n(unobservable) entity, such as knowledge that facilitates the\nmanipulation of the entity and its use so as to intervene in other\nphenomena, one has good reason for realism regarding it.\nStructural realism is the view that one should be a realist,\nnot in connection with descriptions of the natures of things (like\nunobservable entities) found in our best theories, but rather with\nrespect to their structure. All three of these positions adopt a\nstrategy of selectivity, and this and the positions themselves are\nconsidered further in\n section 2.3.\n\nArguably, the fact that realists have endeavored to qualify their view\nand propose variations of it, as described above, suggests a\ncollective moral: though some (especially earlier) discussions of\nrealism give the impression that it is an attitude pertaining to\nscience across the board, this is likely too coarse a way to\nunderstand the position. Adopting a realist attitude toward the\ncontent of scientific theories does not entail that one believes all\nsuch content, but rather that one believes those aspects, including\nunobservable aspects, regarding which one takes such belief to be\nwarranted, thus indicating a realism about those things more\nspecifically. In a similar spirit, some argue for another sort of\nspecificity, suggesting that the best (or only good) arguments for\nrealism are formulated by concentrating on the details of specific\ncases\u2014the so-called \u201cfirst-order evidence\u201d of\nscientific investigation itself. For example, leveraging a case study\nof Jean Perrin\u2019s argument in 1908 for the reality of\nunobservable molecules, Achinstein (2002: 491\u2013495) contends that\neven taking certain realist-friendly assumptions for granted, a\ncompelling argument for realism about any given entity can only be\ngiven in terms of the empirical evidence concerning that entity, not\nby means of more general philosophical arguments. (For similar views,\nsee Magnus & Callender 2004: 333\u2013336 and Saatsi 2010; for\nskepticism about this, see Dicken 2013 and Park 2016.)\n",
