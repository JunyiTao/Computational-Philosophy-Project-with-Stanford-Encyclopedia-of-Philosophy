    "main_text": "History of Fallacy Theory || Bacon\n2.2 Bacon\n\nFrancis Bacon deserves a brief mention in the history of fallacy\ntheory, not because he made any direct contribution to our knowledge\nof the fallacies but because of his attention to prejudice and bias in\nscientific investigation, and the effect they could have on our\nbeliefs. He spoke of false idols (1620, aphorisms 40\u201344) as\nhaving the same relation to the interpretation of nature that\nfallacies have to logic. The idol of the tribe is human nature which\ndistorts our view of the natural world (it is a false mirror). The\nidol of the cave is the peculiarity of each individual man, our\ndifferent abilities and education that affect how we interpret nature.\nThe idols of the theatre are the acquired false philosophies, systems\nand methods, both new and ancient, that rule men\u2019s minds. These\nthree idols all fall into the category of explanations of why we may\nmisperceive the world. A fourth of Bacon\u2019s idols, the idol of\nthe market place, is the one that comes closest to the Aristotelian\ntradition as it points to language as the source of our mistaken\nideas: \u201cwords plainly force and overrule the understanding, and\nthrow all into confusion, and lead men away into numberless empty\ncontroversies and idle fancies\u201d (1620, aphorism 43). Although\nBacon identifies no particular fallacies in Aristotle\u2019s sense,\nhe opens the door to the possibility that there may be false\nassumptions associated with the investigation of the natural world.\nThe view of The New Organon is that just as logic is the cure\nfor fallacies, so will the true method of induction be a cure for the\nfalse idols.\n",
