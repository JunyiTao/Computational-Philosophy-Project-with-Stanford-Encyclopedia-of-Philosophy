Group rights and collective goods\n\nThe distinction between corporate and collective rights concerns the\nway in which we might conceive the subject of a group right.\nBut the issue of whether there is reason to ascribe rights to groups\nis sometimes approached through their possible\nobjects\u2014through what group rights might be rights to.\nIf there are goods that have a necessarily group character and if\nthere are rights to those goods, it would seem that those must be\ngroup rights. So are there such goods?\n\nThe obvious place to start is with the economist\u2019s idea of public\ngoods. We might reasonably suppose with Raz (1986, 208) that a right\ncan be a group right only if it is a right to a good that is public to\nthe members of the right-holding group. For the relevant group, the\ngood must be non-excludable (it must be available to all members of\nthe group) and non-rival (its consumption by one member of the group\nmust not diminish its possible consumption by other members). However,\nas Denise R\u00e9aume has pointed out (1988, 8\u20139), some goods\nthat are deliverable only as public goods can reasonably be considered\nobjects of individual rights. Clean air is a standard example of a\npublic good, but we can reasonably hold that individuals have rights\nto clean air as individuals. An industrialist who seriously pollutes a\ncommunity\u2019s atmosphere might be held to violate the right to breathe\nunpolluted air of each individual in the affected community rather\nthan a collective or corporate right of the community as a group.\n\nR\u00e9aume\u2019s own proposal (1988, 1994), which has attracted much\nattention amongst commentators on group rights, is that we should\nunderstand group rights as rights to \u201cparticipatory\ngoods\u201d. A participatory good is a public good of a particular\ntype. It is a good whose enjoyment by an individual depends upon its\nalso being enjoyed by others. Consider the case of clean air again.\nAlthough this is typically a good that is public to a group, each\nindividual breathes in and out as an individual and enjoys the good of\nclean air as an individual. The goodness of clean air for me does not\ndepend upon its also being good for you, even though it is good for\nyou. Now consider goods such as friendship, a team game, and a\nconvivial party (R\u00e9aume 1988, 12\u201313; Waldron 1993,\n355\u20136). Those are necessarily social goods. I cannot enjoy\ngenuine friendship as an entirely individual good; I can play a team\ngame only if others do too; and I can take pleasure in conviviality\nonly as a shared experience. So some goods are necessarily\n\u201cparticipatory\u201d in nature. These goods have also been\ndescribed as \u201ccommunal\u201d (Waldron 1993, 339\u201369),\n\u201cshared\u201d (Green 1988 207\u20139; Raz 1995, 35\u20136),\nand \u201ccommon\u201d (Marmor 2001). Charles Taylor\u2019s notion of\n\u201cirreducibly social goods\u201d has been deployed to similar\neffect: if those goods are the objects of rights, their irreducibly\nsocial character implies that they must be the objects of group rights\n(Taylor 1995, 127\u2013145; Sheehy 2006, 159\u2013167,\n175\u2013195).\n\nParticipatory goods are goods that must be both produced and enjoyed\npublicly, and goods that are simultaneously produced and enjoyed by\nthose who participate in them. While participatory goods combine\nproduction with consumption, it is the necessarily public character of\ntheir enjoyment that really distinguishes them from other public\ngoods. It is because they can be enjoyed only as shared goods that,\nR\u00e9aume argues, only groups can have rights to them. Her claim\nis not that every participatory good must be the object of a right;\nrather it is that, if there is a right to a participatory good, that\nmust be a group right. The relevant right here is neither the\nliberty-right to participate in the good nor the claim-right to be\nunprevented by others from participating in the good, both of which\nwill normally be individual rights. Rather it is a right to the\nparticipatory good itself (e.g. the right not merely to participate in\nan orchestra but the right of the orchestra to play as an orchestra,\nthe right not merely to participate in a culture but the right that\nthe culture shall be maintained and protected).\n\nSome goods that can yield rights, and that are, R\u00e9aume argues,\nparticipatory in at least some of their aspects, are living in a\ncultured society, sharing a common language, and being a member of a\nreligious community. If groups have rights to these participatory\ngoods, do others have duties to provide them with those goods? If, for\nexample, a group has a right to its culture as a participatory good,\nthat might imply that it is entitled to constrain the freedom of its\ndissident members in ways that ensure the continuance of its culture.\nIf a linguistic minority has a right to its language as a\nparticipatory good, that might imply that it is entitled to coerce\nreluctant others to use its language in order to sustain and promote\nthe language as a participatory good. However, those are not the sort\nof rights that R\u00e9aume proposes since they would be unacceptably\nonerous for those who bore the duty (1988, 16\u201317; 1994,\n133\u20134; see also Marmor 2001). Moreover, some participatory goods\ncan be the goods they are only if people participate in them\nwillingly. \n\nThe group rights that R\u00e9aume suggests might relate to\nparticipatory goods are rights against \u201coutsiders\u201d rather\nthan \u201cinsiders\u201d. And they would be rights not to\noutsiders\u2019 participation in the good, but to their non-prevention of,\nand their non-interference with, the group\u2019s participatory good and\nperhaps also rights to measures and resources that will facilitate the\ngroup\u2019s continued enjoyment of its participatory good. A linguistic\nminority may, for instance, have a right that the majority society\nshould establish, maintain and respect arrangements that will secure\nthe minority\u2019s ability to continue using its language. Similarly, an\nindigenous minority may have a right that the majority society should\ninstitute arrangements that will protect its traditional form of life,\nwhich form of life is, for the minority\u2019s members, a participatory\ngood. But these externally directed rights would remain rights\ngrounded in the group\u2019s interest in its participatory good and that,\nfor R\u00e9aume, means they must be group rights.\n\nThere is an obvious gap in R\u00e9aume\u2019s attempt to identify group\nrights as rights to participatory goods (1994, 123\u20134). If only\ngroups can have rights to participatory goods, it does not follow that\ngroups can have rights only to participatory goods. They may also have\nrights to non-participatory goods, such as safe walkways or community\nhealth safeguards or coastal defences. Even the claim that rights to\nparticipatory goods must be group rights has not escaped challenge.\nJames Morauta (2002) argues that, conceptually, a participatory good\ncould be the object of an individual right. An individual might, for\nexample, have a right to require others to participate with him in\nspeaking his language and those others may be duty-bound to comply if\nhe so insists. That may be a morally unappealing state of affairs but\nnothing in the logic of rights or participatory goods rules it out\n(provided that the very nature of the good at issue does not require\nvoluntary participation). The lacuna that Morauta identifies indicates\nthat the proposition that only groups can have rights to participatory\ngoods relies upon more than just the \u201cstructural features\u201d\nof those goods. It relies also upon a moral assumption about the\nrelative standing of the individuals who have interests in, or who lay\nclaim to, a participatory good.\n\nSuppose, for example, that one person in a nation had, uniquely, a\nright that that nation should be self-determining. His\nfellow-nationals should then be part of a self-determining unit, not\nbecause they are entitled to be, but because he is entitled that they\nshould be. He therefore has a right over their lives that they\nthemselves do not. Normally, we would regard that sort of inequality\nin moral standing as entirely unacceptable; but it is because we take\nthat moral unacceptability for granted that we are predisposed to\naccept that rights to participatory goods\u2014or, indeed, rights to\npublic goods as public goods\u2014must be group rights. Of\ncourse, people of equal standing can be unequally interested in a good\nbut, in any sizeable group, it is most unlikely that one individual\u2019s\ninterest in a good that is public to the group will be so special and\nso disproportionate that that individual will have, uniquely, a right\nto the good as a good for the group as a whole (Jones 2014,\n2018).\n",
