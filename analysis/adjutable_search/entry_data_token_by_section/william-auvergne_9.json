    "main_text": "God\u2019s Relation to Creatures || Against the Eternity of the World\n6.5 Against the Eternity of the World\n\nOne of the most contentious doctrines presented by Greek and Islamic\nphilosophy to thinkers in the early thirteenth century is that of the\neternity of the world, the view that the world had no beginning but\nexisted over an infinite past. This view seems to contradict the\nopening words of the Bible: \u201cIn the beginning God created heaven\nand earth.\u201d In response, a number of thinkers in the early\nthirteenth century, including the Franciscan Alexander of Hales,\nargued that Aristotle, at least, had been misunderstood and had never\nproposed the eternity of the world. But William, like his Oxford\ncontemporary, Robert Grosseteste, would have none of this:\n\u201cWhatever may be said and whoever may try to excuse Aristotle,\nit was undoubtedly his opinion that the world is eternal and that it\ndid not begin to be, and he held the same view concerning motion.\nAvicenna held this after him\u201d (OO I, 690b; Teske 1998a,\n117).\n\nThe importance of this issue to William is indicated by the space he\ndevotes to it. His treatment of the question of the eternity\naeternitas of the world in On the Universe IIa-Iae\nis one of the longest discussions of the issue in the middle ages, and\nthe first substantial treatment to be made in the light of Greek and\nIslamic thought.\n\nWilliam thinks, in fact, that to call the world eternal in the\naforementioned sense is not to use the term \u201ceternal\u201d in\nits strictest sense. Accordingly, he starts by explaining different\nsenses of the term in the first extended treatment of the distinction\nbetween eternity and time in the middle ages. He then presents and\nrefutes arguments that the world has no beginning, and provides his\nown positive arguments that the world must have a temporal beginning,\na first instant of its existence.\n\nWilliam\u2019s chief aim in his treatment of time and eternity is to\nemphasize the fundamental differences between eternity and time. He is\nespecially concerned to attack a conception of eternity as existence\nat every time, a conception he attributes to Aristotle. In his view,\neternity in a strict sense is proper to the creator alone and is his\nvery being, though \u201cthe name \u2018eternity\u2019 says more\nthan his being, namely, the privations of beginning and ending, as\nwell as of flux and change, and this both in act and in potency\u201d\n(OO I, 685b\u2013686a; Teske 1998a, 109). The fundamental difference\nbetween time and eternity is that \u201cas it is proper and essential\nto time to flow or cease to be, so it is proper and essential to\neternity to remain and stand still\u201d (OO I, 683b; Teske 1998a,\n102). William, like other medieval thinkers, tends to describe\neternity in terms of what it is not. It has nothing that flows and\nhence no before or after or parts. Its being is whole at once, not\nbecause it all exists at one time, but because it all exists with\nnothing temporally before or after it. William speaks of duration in\neternity, but he holds that the term has a different (unfortunately\nunexplained) sense in this context than when applied to time.\n\nWilliam had read Aristotle\u2019s Physics and agrees with\nAristotle that time and motion are coextensive (OO I, 700a). Yet he\ndoes not propose Aristotle\u2019s definition of time as the number of\nmotion in respect of before and after. Rather, in his account of the\nessential nature of time he describes time simply as being that flows\nand does not last, \u201cthat is, it has nothing of itself that lasts\nin act or potency\u201d (OO I, 683a; Teske 1998a, 102). Echoing\nAristotle and Augustine, he holds that time has the weakest being, and\nthat \u201cof all things that are said to be in any way, time is the\nmost remote from eternity, and this is because it only touches\neternity by the very least of itself, the now itself or a point of\ntime\u201d (OO I, 748a).\n\nWilliam introduces his account of the eternity of the world in On\nthe Universe by reference to Aristotle, but he devotes the bulk\nof his discussion to Avicenna\u2019s arguments for this doctrine. In\nparallel material in On the Trinity he claims that at the\nroot of Avicenna\u2019s view lies the principle that \u201cif the\none essence is now as it was before when nothing came forth from it,\nsomething will not now come forth from it\u201d (Switalski 1976, 69;\nTeske and Wade 1989, 108). That is, nothing new is caused to exist\nunless there is a change in the cause. Thus God, a changeless being,\ncannot start to create the world after not creating it; and therefore\nhe must have created it from eternity and without a beginning.\nTherefore, the world must itself lack a beginning.\n\nWilliam replies that Avicenna\u2019s principle leads to an infinite\nregress; for if something\u2019s operating after not operating\nrequires a change in it, this change will itself require a new cause,\nand that new cause will itself require a new cause, and so on ad\ninfinitum. William instead holds that it is possible that God,\nwithout changing in any way, start to operate after not operating.\nWhat William means by this is that the effect of God\u2019s eternal\nwill is a world with a temporal beginning. In general, he holds that\nverbs such as \u201ccreate\u201d express nothing in the creator\nhimself but rather something in things. We might put \u201cGod begins\nto create the world\u201d to have the import of: \u201cGod by an\neternal willing creates the world, and the world has a\nbeginning.\u201d\n\nWilliam emphasizes that God does not will that the world exist without\nqualification, but rather that it exist with a given temporal\nstructure, namely, a beginning (Switalski 1976, 67\u201368; Teske and\nWade 1989, 107). This might suggest that he thinks God might in fact\nhave created a world without a beginning, but chose not to do so, as\nAquinas would hold. But in fact, William argues that this option was\nnot open to God: a world without a beginning is simply not a creatable\nitem. William attempts to establish this point by a host of arguments,\nmany of which are found in his writings for the first time in the\nLatin West and repeated by later thinkers such as Bonaventure and\nHenry of Ghent. On the whole, these arguments either allege that the\nnotion of a created thing itself entails that what is created has a\ntemporal beginning or point to alleged paradoxes stemming from the\nsupposition of an infinite past.\n\nFor example, William argues (OO I, 696b; Teske 1998a, 133) that\nbecause the world in itself is merely a possible, in itself it is in\nnon-being and non-being is therefore natural to it. Hence its\nnon-being, being natural to it, is prior to its being, and therefore\nin being created it must receive being after non-being, and thus have\na beginning.\n\nAmong arguments involving infinity, William argues that if the whole\nof past time is infinite then the infinite must have been traversed to\narrive at the present; but since it is impossible to traverse the\ninfinite (OO I, 697b; Teske 1998a, 136), the past must be finite. This\nline of argument is frequently found in later thinkers.\n\nWilliam also presents arguments that the view that a continuum, such\nas time, is infinite results in paradoxes (OO I, 698a\u2013700b).\nThese arguments, which William develops at some length, constitute an\nimportant early medieval engagement with puzzles relating to\ninfinity.\n",
