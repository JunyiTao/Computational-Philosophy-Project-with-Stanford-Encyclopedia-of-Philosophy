    "main_text": "Constructing Plausible Functional Theories || Characterizing the Inputs and Outputs of a System\n4.3 Characterizing the Inputs and Outputs of a System\n\nConsiderations about whether certain sorts of beliefs are to be\nexternally individuated raise the related question about how best to\ncharacterize the stimulations and behaviors that serve as inputs\nand outputs to a system. Should they be construed as events\ninvolving objects in a system\u2019s environment (such as fire\ntrucks, water and lemons), or rather as events in that system\u2019s\nsensory and motor systems? Theories of the first type are often called\n\u201clong-arm\u201d functional theories (Block 1990), since they\ncharacterize inputs and outputs \u2013 and consequently the states\nthey are produced by and produce \u2013 by reaching out into the\nworld. Adopting a \u201clong-arm\u201d theory would prevent our Twin\nEarth counterparts from sharing our beliefs and desires, and may thus\nhonor intuitions that support an externalist individuation of\nintentional states (though further questions may remain about what\nQuine has called the \u201cinscrutability of reference\u201d; see\nPutnam 1988).\n\nIf functional characterizations of intentional states are intended to\ncapture their \u201cnarrow contents\u201d, however, then the inputs\nand outputs of the system will have to be specified in a way that\npermits individuals in different environments to be in the same\nintentional state. On this view inputs and outputs may be better\ncharacterized as activity in specific sensory receptors and motor\nneurons. But this (\u201cshort-arm\u201d) option also restricts the\nrange of individuals that can share our beliefs and desires, since\ncreatures with different neural structures will be prevented from\nsharing our mental states, even if they share all our behavioral and\ninferential dispositions. (In addition, this option would not be open\nto analytic functionalist theories, since generalizations that link\nmental states to neurally specified inputs and outputs would not,\npresumably, have the status of platitudes.)\n\nPerhaps there is a way to specify sensory stimulations that abstracts\nfrom the specifics of human neural structure enough to include any\npossible creature that intuitively seems to share our mental states,\nbut is sufficiently concrete to rule out entities that are clearly not\ncognitive systems (such as the economy of Bolivia; see Block 1980b).\nIf there is no such formulation, however, then functionalists will\neither have to dispel intuitions to the effect that certain systems\ncan\u2019t have beliefs and desires, or concede that their theories\nmay be more \u201cchauvinistic\u201d than initially hoped.\n\nClearly, the issues here mirror the issues regarding the individuation\nof intentional states discussed in the previous section. More work is\nneeded to develop the \u201clong-arm\u201d and\n\u201cshort-arm\u201d alternatives, and to assess the merits and\ndeficiencies of both.\n",
