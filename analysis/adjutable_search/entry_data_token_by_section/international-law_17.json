    "main_text": "International Rule of Law || UN Security Council Resolutions\n5.4 UN Security Council Resolutions\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly\u2019s Declaration on the Rule of\nLaw at the National and International Levels stipulates that\n\n\nthe rule of law applies to all States equally, and to international\norganizations, including the United Nations and its principal organs.\n(UN GA Res 67/1, 24 September 2012, para 2)\n\n\nBut there are notorious difficulties about the extent to which the UN\nSecurity Council, in particular, has complied with the international\nrule of law during the post-Cold War period when it has made\nresolutions \u201cto maintain or restore international peace and\nsecurity\u201d under Chapter VII of the UN Charter (see Crawford\n2014: Ch.XIII). The worry is that exercises of this power\u2014e.g.,\nto impose embargoes, authorize peace-keeping operations or military\nintervention, set up new rules on topics such as terrorism, establish\ncriminal tribunals etc\u2014is insufficiently regulated by law. Even\nif an argument can be made that the Security Council is bound not only\nby the UN Charter, but also by international law generally, a serious\nquestion remains as to the means of securing its compliance with such\nlaw. Is it enough that the legal validity of its resolutions is in\nprinciple justiciable if the issue properly arises in litigation\nbefore a court or tribunal? (ICJ 1971: p. 45, para. 88) Or should the\nICJ be given the general power to review UNSC resolutions as leading\nscholars have suggested (Franck 1995; Crawford & Marks 1998)?\nUltimately, there is an issue of ensuring adequate respect for the\nrule of law while giving the UN Security Council the flexibility to\nrespond effectively to any \u201cthreat to the peace, breach of the\npeace, or act of aggression\u201d (Art 39 UN Charter).\n",
