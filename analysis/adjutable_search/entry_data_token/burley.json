Life and works\n1.1 Life\n\nBurley was born in 1275, probably in or close to the village of\nBurley-in-Wharfedale, Yorkshire. He studied at Oxford University,\nwhere he was a fellow of Merton College, though he may have studied\nfirst at Balliol. His regency as Master of Arts at Merton College was\nlong, from 1300 to 1310. Burley\u2019s clerical career began in 1309, when\nhe was admitted as rector of Welbury, Yorkshire. Along with the income\nfrom his first rectory, he received permission to study and take holy\norders at Paris, where he became associated with Thomas Wylton, whom\nhe refers to as his socius and reverend master in his De\ncomparatione specierum (On the Comparison of Species).\nHe held a quodlibetal disputation at Toulose in 1322, became Master of\nTheology at Paris in 1324, and entered the service of Edward III in\n1327. Around 1333, he joined the circle of Richard de Bury, Bishop of\nDurham. In 1341, he held a quodlibetal disputation in Bologna. He died\nin 1344 or shortly thereafter.\n1.2 Works\n\nBurley\u2019s philosophical and theological production is very impressive.\nUnfortunately, his Parisian commentary on the Sentences has\nnot survived, but almost all of his works on logic and philosophy are\nextant, among which the following can be listed, along with their\napproximate dates of composition (if known):\n\nQuaestiones circa tertium De anima (Questions on the\nthird book of \u2018De anima\u2019) \u2013 before 1301\nQuaestiones in librum Perihermeneias (Questions on\n\u2018De Interpretatione\u2019) (= QP) \u2013\n1301\nTractatus de suppositionibus (Treatise on [the kinds\nof] suppositions) (= De sup.) \u2013 1302\nTractatus super Praedicamenta Aristotelis (Treatise\non Aristotle\u2019s Categories, or Middle Commentary on the\nCategories) (= TsP) \u2013 before 1310 (provisional\nedition by A.D.

Preliminary Remarks\n\nBurley\u2019s views are especially interesting for historians of logic and\nmetaphysics because of their originality, wide influence, and\ndevelopment. Twice during the course of his academic career, in the\nfirst and third decades of the fourteenth century, Burley worked out\nslightly different versions of the same semantic theory in connection\nwith two different conceptions of reality. The first version\n(elaborated in De sup., QP, the middle commentaries\non Aristotle\u2019s Categories and De interpretatione,\nand Ean) is somewhat less sophisticated than the second\n(elaborated in De puritate artis logicae, tractatus longior,\nthe last commentaries on the Physics and Ars Vetus,\nand theTdU). Whereas in his early works Burley was able to\ndifferentiate the intension of an expression (the universal form) from\nits extension (the individuals instantiating that universal form), in\nhis last commentary on the Ars Vetus he distinguishes between\nsense (the mental universal existing in the mind as an object of\nunderstanding) and reference (significatum) of an expression,\nwhich in turn is divided into its intension (the universal) and\nextension (the individuals).\n\nNevertheless, the three main principles of his semantic theory\nremained the same throughout his academic career:\n\nAn abstract term, such as \u2018humanity\u2019\n(\u2018humanitas\u2019) or \u2018whiteness\u2019\n(\u2018albedo\u2019), signifies a common form, which is\npart of the essential nature of numerous individuals, and which has\nthe same kind of existence (extramental or mental) as these\nindividuals.\nConcrete accidental terms do not signify simple objects, but\naggregates composed of a substance and accidental form.\nA sentence is true if and only if it is the sign of \u201cthe\ntruth of things\u201d (veritas rerum), that is, if it\ndescribes how the things are in the world.\n\n\nBut in developing the ontology behind his first semantic system,\nBurley did not subscribe to the same theses that eventually came to\ncharacterize his radically realist ontology, but different ones,\nconsistent with the canons of the moderate realism:\n\nOnly absolute categories (substance, quantity, and quality) are\nreal things; the other categories are said to be \u201creal\naspects\u201d (respectus reales) of the absolute\ncategories\nUniversals have being in individuals, as constitutive parts of\ntheir essence\nReal propositions (propositiones in re) properly exist in\nour mind \u201cobjectively\u201d (obiective), that is, as\nobjects of its act of judgment\n\n\nOn the other hand, Burley\u2019s approach to the matter does not differ\nfrom the one he took in his late maturity. It can be defined as\nanalytical, since he believes that ontologies must be developed in\nrelation to the resolution of semantic problems, and that a\nphilosophical explanation of reality must be preceded by a semantic\nexplanation of the structure and function of our language, even if we\ncan only give meaning to linguistic expressions by correlating the\nexpressions of our language with objects in the world.\n\nBurley\u2019s change of mind about universals was brought about by Ockham\u2019s\ncritique of the traditional realist conception, which demonstrated\nthat the common moderate realist account of the relation between\nlanguage and the world is inconsistent. There is no sign in Burley\u2019s\nworks prior to 1324 that he regarded Ockham as an opponent, but\nbeginning with the prologue to his final commentary on the\nPhysics (a work presumably rewritten in response to Ockham\u2019s\ncriticisms), his main writings on logic and metaphysics always feature\nan analysis of Ockham\u2019s views together with a serious attempt to\nrefute his arguments.\n\nWhat Ockham had argued was that the common realist account of the\nrelation between universals and particulars is inconsistent with the\nstandard definition of identity, and also that particular substances\nand qualities have only an extramental kind of existence, whereas the\nten Aristotelian categories serve to classify mental, written and\nspoken terms, but not things outside the mind. Two facts prove clearly\nthat Burley changed his mind because of his having come into contact\nwith Ockham. First, the problem of universals is not even mentioned in\nhis first commentary on the Physics (before 1316), but\nreceives extensive treatment in the prologue of his second commentary\non the Physics, where he quotes, analyses, and rejects\narguments advanced by the Venerabilis Inceptor. Second,\nBurley\u2019s final commentaries on the Physics, Ars\nVetus, and the TdU contain critiques of Ockham\u2019s views\non universals, truth, and categories, as well as replies to his\narguments against the standard moderate realist doctrine. Moreover,\nBurley seems to believe that Duns Scotus\u2019s strategy of drawing formal\ndistinctions does not work, since it implies a rejection of the\nstandard definition of identity according to which two things are\nidentical if and only if whatever is predicated of one is also\npredicated of the other (EP, ch. de oppositione,\nfol. 44rb; TdU, p. 22).\n\nThe result was a new theory of reality based on the following\ntheses:\n\nThe categories are really distinct from each other (EP,\nch. de sufficientia praedicamentorum, fol. 21ra\u2013b).\nUniversals and particulars are really distinct from each other\n(EPhys, prol., fol. 9rb; EP, ch. de\nsubstantia, passim; EPh, ch. de oppositione\nenuntiationum, fol. 74rb\u2013va; TdU, pp. 14\u201340);\nThe external world contains real propositions that are the\nsignificata of true sentences (EP, prooem.,\nfols. 17vb\u201318va; ch. de priori, fol. 47va; EPh,\nprol., fol. 66ra\u2013b);\n\n\nIt must be pointed out here that this \u2018new\u2019 theory is the most\ndiscussed point of Burley\u2019s philosophical system: J\u00f6el Biard,\nAlessandro D. Conti, Christian Rode, and Hans-Ulrich W\u00f6hler defend\nthe thesis of a plurality of theories, whereas Laurent Cesalli, Alain\nde Libera, and Stephan Meier-Oeser claim that Burley develops the same\ntheoretical intuition from 1301 (the date of composition of his\nQuaestiones in librum Perihermeneias) to 1337. Furthermore,\nthe real proposition described in the final commentary on the\nCategories is considered by Cesalli to be a sort of complex,\nimmanent, intentional object rather than an extramental state of\naffairs or a fact; other scholars, such as Gabriel Nuchelmans, Biard,\nand Rode, believe it to be a kind of mixed entity, partly mental,\npartly extra mental; finally, and a third group of scholars, such as\nConti, de Libera, Meier-Oeser, and Jan Pinborg, think of it in terms\nof a state of affairs or a fact. \n\nThe three theses mentioned above suggest a kind of identification of\nlogic and metaphysics, especially since Burley wanted logic to be the\ntheory of discourse on Being. Logic must be metaphysically grounded in\nthe correspondence between the structural features of discourse (both\nbetween the subject and predicate of a proposition, as well as between\nthe premises and conclusion of a syllogism) and the structure of\nreality. Burley maintains that logic is nothing but an analysis of the\ngeneral structures of reality. In discussing the nature, status, and\nsubject of logic in the introduction to his final commentary on the\nArs Vetus (fol. 2rb\u2013va), he claims that logic is about things\nof second intention as such, second intentions being those concepts of\nthings (conceptus rei) that arise when we see the common\nnature in relation to the things that instantiate it. Logic is\naccordingly about structural forms, which are, as forms, independent\nof the mental acts through which they are acquired. Through these\nstructural forms, the connections between the basic constituents of\nreality (individual and universals, substances and accidents) are\ndisclosed.\n3. Ontology (before 1324): categories and universals\n\nThe first important feature of Burley\u2019s earlier ontology is his belief\nthat apart from substances, quantities, and qualities, the categories\ndo not contain entities in the full sense of the term, but\nrespectus reales, i.e., real aspects of absolute things. In\nthe fourth chapter of his middle commentary on the Categories\n(ch. de numero et sufficientia praedicamentorum, ed. Conti,\npp. 25\u201328), Burley mentions two previous accounts of the problem of\nthe number and distinction of the ten categories. The first (from\nSimon of Faversham\u2019s commentary, q. 12) claims that the categories\nreally divide entities according to their modes of being. The second,\ninspired by Henry of Ghent, admits that\nbeing-in-relation-to-something-else (esse ad aliud), i.e.,\nthe mode of being of the seven non-absolute categories, does not\ninvolve a res distinct from substance, quantity, and quality,\nbut only their real aspects. Although Burley does not explicitly\nendorse either interpretation, he is not exactly neutral on the\nmatter. In fact, his introductory comments together with the amount of\nspace he devotes to each suggest that he agrees with those authors who\nthink that, properly speaking, only the three absolute categories are\nfully things (res). Consequently, Burley presents Henry\u2019s\ninterpretation as emerging from the lack of supporting proof for\nSimon\u2019s thesis (TsP, ch. de numero et sufficientia\npraedicamentorum, ed. Conti, pp. 26\u201327). Moreover, he states that\nthe ten categories can be ordered in terms of their degrees of reality\nand independence, since the non-absolute categories are caused by and\ngrounded in the three absolute ones (TsP, ch. de numero\net sufficientia praedicamentorum, ed. Conti, p. 27).\n\nAt the beginning of his philosophical career, Burley seems to have\nbeen attracted by Henry of Ghent\u2019s theory rather than by the more\nradical one he was to support some thirty years later. As far as the\nconstitutive and distinctive principles of the categories are\nconcerned, however, in the middle commentary on the\nCategories Burley advances the same ideas that he defends in\nhis final commentary. He thinks that what characterizes each category\nis its peculiar mode of being and that this is much more important\nthan the differentiation of essences (TsP, ch. de\nsubstantia, ed. Conti, p. 29\u2014the formulation of this\nthesis corresponds almost verbatim to that of the final\ncommentary).\n\nRegarding the relation of the ten categories to being (ens\ntranscendens) and the determination of what properly belongs in\nthe categories, Burley\u2019s position is unchanged between his earlier and\nlater commentaries on the Categories and Physics. On\nthe former question, his Categories commentaries are\ninfluenced by Albert the Great. They contain only the brief remark\nthat being, as a transcendental, is predicated analogically of the\ncategories (see the ch. de aequivocatione). By contrast, the\ntwo Physics commentaries provide an exhaustive treatment of\nboth questions, with some terminological differences. With regard to\nthe first (see the question from book I, utrum ens sit aequivocum\nad decem praedicamenta\u2014whether being is equivocal in\nrelation to the ten categories, pp. 192\u201394), Burley affirms that\nbeing is both univocal and analogical with respect to the categories:\nunivocal because the items falling under the categories are called\n\u2018beings\u2019 according to a single concept, and analogical\nbecause being is possessed by the categories in different \nways\u2014directly by substance and secondarily by accidents. In his final\ncommentary on the Physics (book I, fols. 12vb\u201313ra), Burley\nmaintains that being is both univocal and equivocal with respect to\nthe ten categories: univocal broadly speaking because a single concept\ncorresponds to it (even though categorial entities are subsumed under\nit in different ways), and equivocal, though not most strictly,\nbecause this single concept is attributed to beings (entia)\naccording to a hierarchy of value. In short, the two commentaries\ndiffer only in their use of the terms \u2018analogical\u2019 and\n\u2018equivocal\u2019. In the first commentary, Burley uses the term\n\u2018equivocal\u2019 for those terms Boethius, in his own\ncommentary on the Categories, defines as equivocal by chance\n(a casu), and the term \u2018analogical\u2019 for those\nBoethius calls deliberately equivocal (a consilio). In the\nsecond, Burley calls \u2018equivocal properly speaking\u2019\n(proprie) those terms Boethius refers to as \u2018\ndeliberately equivocal\u2019, and \u2018equivocal most\nstrictly\u2019 (magis proprie) those Boethius calls\n\u2018by chance\u2019.\n\nMore interesting is Burley\u2019s solution to the problem of which entities\nproperly fall under which categories. Unlike most medieval thinkers,\nhe was well aware of the importance of this question, which he\ndiscusses in his middle and final commentaries on the\nCategories (ch. de relatione), as well as in his\nLsP (ch. de quando, fol. 57va). According to the\ncommon realist view, not only simple accidental forms (such as\nwhiteness), but also the compound entities they cause when inhering in\nsubstances (a white thing\u2014album) belong to the nine\ncategories of accident. Burley denies this, since he regards the\nentities resulting from the combination of substance and accidental\nforms as mere aggregates: accidental beings (entia per\naccidens) lacking in any real unity. He claims that what is\nsignified by abstract terms, i.e., simple forms such as whiteness and\nfatherhood, properly falls under the categories, whereas what is\nsignified by concrete accidental terms does not. An aggregate may be\nsaid to belong, improperly and reductively, to the category to which\nits accidental form belongs (Tsp, ch. de relatione,\ned. Conti, pp. 60\u201361; EP, chs. de relatione fol.\n35va, and de qualitate, fol. 41rb). Concrete substance-terms\n(such as \u2018man\u2019) are different, however. For even though\nthey signify composites, they signify beings with a real, per\nse unity that properly belongs to the category of substance. In\nthis case, the abstract forms connoted by concrete substance terms\n(e.g., the form of humanity by \u2018man\u2019) do not lie outside\nthe nature of the things themselves, i.e., the individual substances\nfor which the concrete substance-terms supposit. Thus, both the form\nand its substance belong to the same categorial field (EP,\nch. de denominativis, fol. 19va\u2013b). In this case, the\nindividual substances are the bearers (supposita) of the form\nand not its subject (subiecta), as they are instantiations of\nit and not mere vessels of inherence (TdU, p. 58; see also\nDe relativis, p. 168).\n\nBurley\u2019s earlier position on the question of the number of categories\nimplies a \u2018soft\u2019 attitude towards the problem of defining\nand classifying the types of identity, since it is evident that the\nnon-absolute categories could be considered similar to the absolute\nones. Burley does not deal with this subject in his middle commentary\non the Categories, however, but in the Quaestiones in\nlibrum Perihermenias (q. 4), following Henry of Ghent, he\nmaintains that (1) there are three different kinds of identity: real\n(realis), notional (secundum rationem), and\nintentional (secundum intentionem); (2) intentional\ndifference is something between real and notional difference; and (3)\ntwo things differ intentionally if and only if they are constitutive\nof the same thing without their definitions overlapping, such that\neach can be understood independently of the other, and even together\nwith the negation of the other (QP, q. 4, p. 273). Even so,\nhe does not use this logical machinery to explain the relationship\nbetween absolute and non-absolute categories, but only to clarify the\nrelations between genus and difference, essence and being\n(esse). He maintains that there is no real distinction\nbetween essence and being (as Thomas Aquinas and Giles of Rome had\ntaught), but that they are only intentionally distinct.\n\nThe most important feature of Burley\u2019s early ontology is his claim\nthat the being (esse) of universals coincides with the being\nof their instantiations as particulars, so that universals can be said\nto be everlasting because of the succession of these particulars, not\nbecause of a peculiar kind of esse (TsP, ch. se\nsubstantia, ed. Conti, p. 34; see also Ean, the question\nin book I, utrum universale habeat esse extra \nanimam\u2014whether what is universal has real being outside the \nmind\u2014,fols. 9ra\u201311ra). In his middle commentary on the De\ninterpretatione (pp. 53\u201356) Burley also speaks of mental\nuniversals, i.e., the concepts through which our mind relates general\nnames to their significata. We might sum up his position on\nuniversals in these texts as follows: (1) universals exist in a\ntwofold way, as common natures in extramental reality and as concepts\nin our minds; (2) real universals are naturally suited to be present\nin many things as their primary metaphysical components; (3) mental\nuniversals are partially caused in our minds by common natures\nexisting outside our minds; and (4) real universals have no being\n(esse) outside the being of their particular\ninstantiations.\n\nBurley\u2019s theory of universals is obviously a form of moderate realism,\nbut it differs from that defended by other authors such as Thomas\nAquinas. According to Aquinas, universals exist in potentia\noutside the mind, but in actu within the mind, whereas on\nBurley\u2019s account they exist in actu extra animam, since their\nbeing is the same as the being of individuals, which is actual. For\nBurley, a universal is in actu if and only if there is at\nleast one individual instantiating it. Therefore, our mind does not\ngive actuality to universals, but only a separate mode of\nexistence.\n4. Ontology (before 1324): essences and substantial forms\n\nGenerally speaking, for a medieval realist the essence of a thing is\nthe main metaphysical component of that thing, namely that in virtue\nof which that thing is something of a certain kind: a human, a cat, or\na stone. Therefore, essences are connected with being taken only in\nthe sense of that which is real, that is to say, actually existing.\nSince being taken in this sense is divided into the ten categories and\nis absolutely and primarily said of substances and only secondarily of\naccidents, essences were usually viewed as something (1) common to a\nmultiplicity of items in virtue of which these various items belong to\ntheir species and genera, as humanity is the essence of humans; and\n(2) present primarily and properly in substances, but in accidents\nsecondarily and derivatively.\n\nIn the second half of the 13th century, the debate on essence was\nfocused on the relation between substantial essence (the so called\n\u2018forma totius\u2019, e.g., humanity) and the singular\nsubstantial form which, together with the singular matter, brings the\nsubstantial composite about (the so-called \u2018forma\npartis\u2019, e.g., human souls, which in union with human bodies\ngive rise to human beings). Medieval authors disputed a lot about\nwhether or not the essence (the forma totius) of a thing had\nto be somehow identified with the singular substantial form (the\nforma partis). Following Averroes\u2019 commentary on the\nMetaphysics (book VII, t.c. 34), some authors maintained that\nit was so. Others, such as Thomas Aquinas (Summa theologiae,\nI, q. 75, a. 4), supported the thesis that the substantial essence of\na thing and its singular form are somehow distinct entities, since the\nessence includes the common matter of the species, namely the material\nproper to all the members of the species connected with the essence\n(flesh and bones for human beings).\n\nBurley deals with these topics for the first time in his juvenile\nmiddle commentary on the Categories and Tractatus de\nabstractis (still unedited). In former work, he claims that\nsubstantial essences have no being (esse) outside the being\nof their instantiations (TsP, ch.\u00a0de substantia,\ned. Conti, pp. 34\u201335). Individual substances are unique metaphysical\nentities, located at a particular place and time, and substantial\nessences are their specific forms, apt to be common to several\nsingulars at the same time, present in them, and having no independent\nexistence. An individual substance, such as the substance of Socrates,\nis compounded not only by singular form and matter, but also by any\nsubstantial essence which is over-ordered to the singular substance\nand therefore predicated in quid of it. Furthermore, in his\nopinion, singular substances can be acknowledged as members of a given\n(natural) species by virtue of their conformity to the abstract\nessence they instantiate (TsP, ch.\u00a0de substantia,\ned. Conti, pp. 36\u201337; see also pp. 32\u201333). \n\nIn both the treatises, Burley follows Averroes in solving the question\nof the relationship between the essence as forma totius (in\nhuman beings, the humanity) and the forma partis (in human\nbeings, the soul). In his opinion, the forma totius of a\nthing is the same entity as the forma partis of that thing.\nBut we can refer to this entity by means of two different concepts,\ndepending on two different points of view. So according to him, the\nnoun \u2018humanity\u2019 and the expression \u2018intellective soul\u2019 have\nthe same reference, but different senses. \u2018Humanity\u2019 means the\nintellective soul considered as completing and perfecting a certain\nkind of body, and not by itself, as such and such an entity. On the\ncontrary, \u2018intellective soul\u2019 does refer to the intellective soul\ninsofar as it is such and such an entity, and not insofar as it is the\nentity complementing such and such a body. Hence \u2018humanity\u2019 is\nequivalent to the expression \u2018intellective soul informing a body\u2019\n(Tractatus de abstractis, Vatican City, Bibliotheca\nApostolica Vaticana, Vat. Lat. 2146, fol. 249rb). In this way, through\nthe reference to body, Burley tried to preserve Thomas Aquinas\u2019s\nidea (De ente et essentia, ch. 2) that the definition of the\nessence of a thing must contain not only its form, but its matter as\nwell. \n\nBurley argues that if the forma totius were a distinct entity\nin relation to the forma partis, then these two clearly\nunacceptable consequences would follow: firstly, a whole thing\n(totum) would be part of itself; secondly, there would be an\ninfinite regress of formae totius for each and every singular\nsubstance in the world (Tractatus de abstractis, fol.\n249rb).\n\nThis view had been already supported in the Tractatus super librum\nPredicamentorum, where, in commenting on the third chapter of the\nCategories, Burley had also pointed out that the body which\nis traditionally seen as a part of the human composite is an aggregate\n(aggregatum) of prime matter and the general form of\nquantity, and therefore not properly speaking part of the substance.\nRather, it is part of the macro-object (obiectum sensus),\nnamely the whole aggregate compounded by the substance and all of its\naccidental forms (TsP, ch.\u00a0de regulis\npraedicationis, ed. Conti, p. 24). On the contrary, those authors\nwho admit a plurality of substantial forms in the primary substance\nmust concede that the body which is part of the substance is a\ncomposite (compositum) of prime matter and the imperfect\nsubstantial form of corporeity (corporeitas; see\nTsP, ch.\u00a0de regulis praedicationis, ed. Conti, pp.\n24\u201325).\n\nThe same ideas concerning forma partis and forma\ntotius are restated in the first part of the later Tractatus\nde formis, where Burley continously identifies the human form\nwith the intellective soul (pp. 9, 10, and 15). In this work, he deals\nwith the nature and ontological status of prime matter and the\ndistinction between substantial and accidental forms. The thesis of\nthe real distinction between the essence and its individuals is not\nyet supported, and Averroes\u2019s influence is still heavy. Burley\ndefines substantial forms as those forms which immediately perfect\nmatter and give existence (esse simpliciter) to the\ncomposite, whereas accidental forms presuppose the existence of the\ncomposite, and perfect it. As a result, individuals belonging to the\nsame natural species differ from each other because of their own\nmatter, substantial form (or essence), and accidental forms (p.\n9).\n\nWhat characterizes Burley\u2019s opinion on essence in the period 1300\u201323\nseems to be the acceptance of the Averroistic thesis of the\nidentification of the forma totius with the forma\npartis. It is evident that in the human composite the essence is\nnothing but the intellective soul which informs the body. This choice\nallows Burley to justify the interpretation of the relation between\npredicate and subject of an essential predication in terms of\nidentity, and gives him a strong criterion for distinguishing\nsubstantial from accidental forms. Furthermore, it also allows him to\nhave an ontology rather lacking in kinds of entities: he admits the\nextramental existence of secondary substances, and so the extramental\nexistence of substantial essences, but even if they are real from a\ncertain point of view, absolutely considered (namely, from the point\nof view of their being) such essences have to be identified with the\nsubstantial forms which constitute the substantial composites. As a\nconsequence, the macro-objects (or obiecta sensus) are\naggregates made up by singular matter and (substantial) form and a\ncongeries of singular accidental forms inhering in the composite of\nmatter and form -- a description of the (metaphysical) structure of\nthings with which even a nominalist could have agreed. Yet, for\nBurley, the substantial form displays and transmits to the composite\nits own genetic inheritance (so to speak), namely the string of (real)\nproperties (the specific differences) which give rise to that\nsubstantial form from the generic and simple property of\nbeing-a-substance. And so, if considered from the point of view of its\n\u201cgenetic inheritance\u201d, the form is the essence, or forma\ntotius, of the composite, and, as such, somehow differs from\nitself viewed as forma partis of the composite. \n5. Semantics\n\nThe basic idea of Burley\u2019s theory of meaning is that the simple\nexpressions in our language (i.e., names) are distinct from complex\nexpressions (i.e., sentences) by virtue of their own\nsignificata, that is, by virtue of the different kinds of\nobjects they signify. In fact, the objects signified by complex\nexpressions are composites of those signified by simple expressions,\ntogether with a relation of identity (or non-identity, in the case of\na true negative sentence) holding between them. A simple object is any\nitem in a category: a particular substance, substantial form, or\naccidental form (De sup., p. 31; TsP, ch. de\nsubiecto et praedicato, ed. Conti, pp. 18\u201319; EPhys.,\nprol., fol. 5vb; EP, ch. de subiecto et\npraedicato, fol. 20ra). Furthermore, only complex expressions can\nbe literally true or false, whereas simple expressions are true or\nfalse only metaphorically (TsP, ch. de substantia,\ned. Conti, pp. 41\u201342; QP, q. 3, p. 248; EP, ch,\nde oppositione, fol. 45va; Eph, prol. fol.\n66rb). As a result, Burley assumes that every simple expression in our\nlanguage is like a label naming just one object in the world, and that\nsemantic distinctions are derived from ontological differences between\nsignified objects. He recognizes that general terms such as\n\u2018man\u2019 name a set of objects, whereas proper names such as\n\u2018Socrates\u2019 and expressions such as \u2018a certain\nman\u2019 (\u2018aliquis homo\u2019), name just one object\nbelonging to a set. This difference is explained not by appealing to\nsome semantic distinction between terms, but by means of the different\nmodes of existence of their significata. Proper names and\nindividual expressions name individuals (i.e., object tokens), but\ngeneral terms name common natures (i.e., object types), which are the\nmetaphysical constituents of the set of individuals instantiating\nthem. For instance, the general name \u2018man\u2019 names and can\nstand for each and every man only because it primarily signifies the\nuniversal form of humanity that is present in each and every man and\nconstitutive of his essence (TsP, ch. de substantia,\ned. Conti, pp. 37\u201338; EP, ch. de substantia, fols.\n25vb\u201326ra). In his middle commentary on De interpretatione,\nBurley remarks in connection with the opening lines of the chapter\nseven of Aristotle\u2019s text (17a38\u2013b7) that a linguistic\nexpression is a general name (nomen appellativum) if and only\nif it signifies a universal, that is, a thing (res) common to\nmany individuals (p. 85). The same idea is expressed in his final\ncommentary on De interpretatione (ch. de oppositione\nenuntiationum, fol. 74rb\u2013va; see also EP, ch. de\nsubstantia, fol. 26ra).\n\nSince the criterion for distinguishing linguistic expressions is based\non ontological differences among their significata, Burley\u2019s\nsemantic system includes a third kind of expression falling between\nthe simple and the complex. These are concrete accidental terms (such\nas \u2018white\u2019 or \u2018father\u2019), whose\nsignificata are not absolutely simple but not exactly complex\neither. Quite often in the middle (ed. Conti, pp. 12, 14\u201315, 19, 33,\n38, 60, 78) and final commentaries on the Categories (chs.\nde sufficientia praedicamentorum, fol. 21ra; de\nsubstantia, fol. 24rb; de relatione, fol. 34rb; see also\nLsP, ch. de ubi, fol. 59vb) he affirms that instead\nof signifying simple objects, concrete accidental terms signify\naggregates of substance along with the accidental form primarily\nsignified by the term itself. Such aggregates are lacking in numerical\nunity and hence do not fall under any of the ten categories; they are\nnot properly beings (entia). For this reason, although\nconcrete accidental terms are not simple from a grammatical point of\nview, they do not count as names (TsP, ch. de subiecto et\npraedicato, ed. Conti, pp. 19\u201320; EP, chs. de\nrelatione, fol. 37ra\u2013b; de qualitate, fol. 41rb). The\nmetaphysical constituents of such aggregates (substance and accidental\nform) are related to the concrete accidental term in different ways:\non the one hand, the form is the primary significatum, even\nif the concrete accidental term is not the name of the form; on the\nother, the concrete accidental term can only supposit for the\nsubstance. In other words, concrete accidental terms name substances,\nbut indirectly, through the accidental forms from which they take\ntheir names, so that they name substances only insofar as they are\nsubject (subiecta) to a form. This fact accounts for both the\ndifference between the general names in the category of substance\n(such as \u2018man\u2019) and concrete accidental terms, and the\npresence of the relation of identity (or non-identity) in so-called\n\u2018real propositions\u2019 (propositiones in re).\nGeneral names in the category of substance are concrete terms as well,\nbut the form they primarily signify is really identical to the\nsubstances they name. Therefore, in this case, the name of the form is\nthe same as the name of the substance (TsP, ch. de\nsubstantia, ed. Conti, p.38; EP, ch. de\ndenominativis, fol. 19va\u2013b). This implies a difference in meaning\nbetween abstract and concrete substantial terms\n(\u2018humanity\u2019 vs. \u2018man\u2019). \u2018Humanity\u2019\nis not the name of the form considered in its entirety, but only of\nits essential principle, that is, the intensional content carried by\n\u2018man\u2019, seeing that abstract substantial terms signify\nsubstantial forms apart from their own being (esse). In the\nextramental world, this being coincides with those token-objects\n(i.e., individual substances) which instantiate the form (QP,\nq. 4, pp. 271\u2013273).\n\nThese differences mean that in Burley\u2019s system a distinction can be\ndrawn between the intension and the extension of an expression. We\nusually think of the intension of a term as the set of essential\nproperties that determines the applicability of the term itself, and\nits extension as the set of things to which it is properly applied.\nFrom an epistemological point of view, this makes our ability to pick\nout the extension of a term dependent on our knowledge of its\nintension. If we treat common natures and particular things as the\nintension and extension of terms, respectively, we come very close to\nBurley\u2019s account, with the possible exception of the ontological\nstatus of intensions (if we are \u2018nominalists\u2019), since\nBurley regards both common natures and particular things as entities\nin the world. Hence Burley distinguishes what a term signifies (id\nquod terminus significat) from what it denotes (id quod\nterminus denotat), which is reflected in the distinction between\nsimple and personal supposition. According to him, the sentence\n\u2018the father and the son are simultaneous by nature\u2019 is\ntrue if the two subjects have simple supposition and so refer to their\nsignificata, i.e., the two aggregates compounded by substance\nand accidental form. On the other hand, if we assume that the subjects\nhave personal supposition and so refer only to the two substances,\n\u2018father\u2019 and \u2018son\u2019, then the sentence is false\n(TsP, ch. de relatione, ed. Conti, pp. 71\u201372;\nEP, ch. de relatione, fol. 37ra\u2013b). In the De\nsuppositionibus and De puritate the same idea is\nexpressed by the definition of formal supposition as the supposition\nthat a term has when it supposits for its significatum or for\nthe singular objects that instantiate it. In the first case, we\nproperly speak of simple supposition, and in the second, we speak of\npersonal supposition (De Sup., pp. 35\u201336, De\npuritate, pp. 7\u20138).\n\nThis kind of approach to the problem of the meaning of simple\nexpressions has two interesting consequences: (1) proper names have no\nintension, unlike individual expressions (such as \u2018a certain\nman\u2019\u2014\u2018aliquis homo\u2019); and (2)\nabstract terms in the category of substance (such as\n\u2018humanity\u2019\u2014\u2018humanitas\u2019) are\nlike proper names of intentions, as they have intension but no\nextension.\n\nAs far as the problem of the meaning and truth of complex expressions\nis concerned, Burley thinks that real propositions (propositiones\nin re) are the significata of true sentences, just as\nindividuals (both substantial and accidental) are the\nsignificata of singular names and universals the\nsignificata of general names. The real proposition is the\nlast of the four kinds of propositions mentioned by Burley: written,\nspoken, mental, and real.\n\nAccording to his first theory, (elaborated in the first\ndecade of the 14th century), these so-called\n\u2018real\u2019 propositions do not properly exist in the\nextramental world, although they do exist in our minds as objects of\nacts of intellection or judgment. Burley clearly states that whereas\nmental propositions exist in our minds as subjects of inherence\n(habent esse subiectivum in intellectu), real propositions\nexist in our minds as intentional objects (habent esse obiectivum\nin intellectu solum) (QP, q. 3, pp. 248\u201349;\nCP, p. 61; see also QPo, q. 2, p. 63). Real\npropositions are complex entities formed by the things to which their\nsubjects and predicates refer, together with an identity relation (if\nthe proposition is affirmative) or a non-identity relation (if the\nproposition is negative). The things signified exist in the\nextramental world, but the identity relation is produced by our minds\nand exists only in them. This identity relation is a sort of\nintellectual composition by which we understand that the thing\n(res) signified by the subject term and the thing signified\nby the predicate term of a proposition belong to the same substance(s)\n(QP, q. 3, p. 250). On the other hand, it is correct to call\nthe significatum of a sentence a \u2018real\nproposition\u2019, since the fact that two or more things share the\nsame substance does not depend on our minds (CP, pp.\n61\u201362). As the subject of a standard philosophical sentence must\nbe the name of a substance and the predicate a general expression\nsignifying a substantial common nature or an aggregate of substance\nand accidental form, it is clear that the identity relation can hold\nonly between the things which the subject and predicate of a true\naffirmative proposition stand for in personal supposition, i.e.,\nbetween the particular substances named by the subject and predicate\nexpressions of the proposition. In a standard proposition, the\nsignificata of a subject and predicate are diverse, but what\nthey stand for has to be the same if the proposition is true. Since\nthe things a term stands for are not established a priori but\ndependent on propositional context, the analysis of the structure of a\nproposition in terms of the identity relation requires a\ncorrespondence theory of truth. In his middle commentary on the De\nInterpretatione (pp. 59\u201360), Burley speaks openly of truth\nin terms of the \u201cadequation\u201d or congruity between thought\nand reality (adaequatio intellectus ad rem\u2014see also\nEPh., prol., fol. 66ra). Every being (ens)\nis true (verum) in itself, insofar as its structure and inner\norganization are plainly revealed to the mind. This structural truth\n(veritas rei) corresponds to a mental truth (veritas in\nintellectu) (CP, p. 60): when our minds successfully\nreproduce the internal structure of what is signified by a simple\nexpression or when they grasp the lack of any relationship between the\nsignificata of two simple expressions, a diminished being\n(ens diminutum), which has our mind as its subject of\ninherence, is generated by the mind. This diminished being is the\nveritas in intellectu, which corresponds to the veritas\nrei. If our attempt fails, falsity (falsitas) is\ngenerated instead (CP, p. 61).\n\nIt is to Burley\u2019s credit that he is also able to distinguish between\nthe intension and extension of complex expressions, as indicated by\nhis distinction between a proposition habens esse subiectivum in\nintellectu and habens esse obiectivum in intellectu. In\nfact: (1) although the mental proposition exists in the mind as in a\nsubject, the real proposition is present in the mind only qua\nobject of the act of understanding; (2) the real proposition provides\nthe objective content which the other kinds of proposition aim to\nexpress; and (3) the mental proposition is the semantic link between\nthe spoken and written propositions on the one hand, and the real\nproposition they refer to on the other.\n\nBurley\u2019s first semantics of complex expressions runs into\ndifficulties on some fronts, however. If no real proposition matches\nspoken, written, and mental propositions that are false, what is\ngrasped when we understand the meaning of a false proposition?\nMoreover, real propositions have an indeterminate ontological status,\nsince they exist partly inside the mind, partly outside, and are yet\nentirely independent of it. In this last case, the problem can be\ntraced to deficiencies in his ontological system, which does not allow\nhim to bring into focus the relation between the substantial unity and\nthe multiplicity of real aspects of a thing (res). Thus, the\nreal proposition, the ultimate significatum of a sentence\nthat exists in our minds qua object of an act of judgment,\ncan be equated with a state of affairs only in relation to its\nstructure and semantic value, but not ontologically. In this way,\nBurley\u2019s first theory of meaning, as far as the semantics of\npropositions is concerned, looks to be a compromise between the\ntheories of Walter Chatton, who treats meaning as an individual thing\n(res), and Adam Wodeham, who argues that the meaning of a\nproposition is the state of affairs signified by the proposition\n(complexe significabile), which is not a thing.\n\nIt was in order to solve the problems mentioned above that Burley\nmodified his theory of semantics in his final commentary on the\nArs Vetus\u2014as we are going to see in the next\nsection.\n6. The \u201cPlatonic\u201d turn (after 1324): the new ontology (and semantics) of the macro-objects\n\nAlthough he defended moderate realism at the beginning of his career,\nBurley turned to an original form of radical, somehow Platonic,\nrealism after 1324. This can be found in the prologue to his final\ncommentary on the Physics, in his final commentary on the\nArs Vetus, and in TdU, where he fully develops and\nexplains his new semantic and ontological view. As noted above, the\nchange was brought about by Ockham\u2019s critique of the traditional\nrealist view. In his Summa Logicae (pars I, chs. 14\u201315,\nand 40\u201341) and Commentary on the Categories (prologue,\nand chs. 7, \u00a71 and 8, \u00a71), the Venerabilis Inceptor\nhad shown that many unacceptable consequences follow from the idea\nthat universals are something existing in re, really\nidentical with their particulars considered as instances of a type\n(e.g., the universal man qua man is identical with Socrates),\nbut different considered as properly universal (e.g., man qua\nuniversal is different from Socrates). That is because whatever is\npredicated of the particulars must be predicated of their universals\ntoo, and so a unique common nature would possess contrary attributes\nsimultaneously via the attributes of different particulars. Also, God\ncould not annihilate Socrates or any other singular substance without\nat the same time destroying the whole category of substance and\ntherefore every created being, since every accident depends on\nsubstance for its existence. For these and other similar reasons,\nOckham concluded that the thesis that universals exist in re\nmust be rejected.\n\nBurley was persuaded that Ockham\u2019s objections are sufficient to show\nthat the traditional realist account of the relation between\nuniversals and particulars is unacceptable, but not that realism as a\nwhole is untenable. Thus, in his later years he developed an ontology\nof macro-objects based on a threefold real distinction\nbetween categorial items or simple objects and state of affairs (his\npropositiones in re), between universals and individuals, and\namong the ten categories.\n\nOn Burley\u2019s later view, macro-objects (i.e., what is signified by a\nproper name or definite description such as Socrates or some\nparticular horse) are basic components of the world. They are\naggregates made up of primary substances together with a host of\nsubstantial and accidental forms, both universal and singular,\nexisting in them and through them. Primary substances and substantial\nand accidental forms are simple objects or categorial items, each\npossessing a unique, well-defined nature. These simple objects belong\nto one of ten main types or categories, each really distinct from the\nothers. Although they are simple, some of these components are in a\nsense composite because they are reducible to something \nelse\u2014for example, primary substance is composed of a particular form and\nmatter (EP, ch. de substantia, fol. 22ra). Primary\nsubstance differs from the other components of a macro-object because\nof its peculiar mode of being as an autonomous and independently\nexisting object\u2014in contrast to the other categorial items,\nwhich necessarily presuppose it for their existence (EP, ch.\nde substantia, fol. 22ra\u2013b). Primary substances are therefore\nsubstrates of existence and predication in relation to everything\nelse. The distinction between substantial and accidental forms derives\nfrom their different relations to primary substances, which\ninstantiate substantial forms (which in turn, qua\ninstantiated, are secondary substances), so that such universal forms\ndisclose the natures of particular substances. By contrast, those\nforms that simply affect primary substances without being actually\njoined to their natures are accidental forms. In Burley\u2019s words, the\nforms in relation to which particular substances are the\nsupposita are substantial forms (or secondary substances),\nwhereas those forms in relation to which particular substances are the\nsubiecta are accidental forms (TdU, pp.\n58\u201359). As a result, the macro-object is not simply a primary\nsubstance but an orderly collection of categorial items, so that\nprimary substance, even though it is the most important element, does\nnot contain the whole being of the macro-object.\n\nThe main feature of this metaphysical conception is Burley\u2019s claim\nthat universals fully exist outside the mind and are really distinct\nfrom the individuals in which they are present and of which they are\npredicated. According to him, if universals are no longer actual\nconstituent parts of their particulars, then the inconsistencies\npointed to by Ockham vanish. Furthermore, from a metaphyisical point\nof view, causes must be proportional to their effects. But the causes\nof a particular thing must be particular, whereas those of a common\nnature must be universal. Therefore, individual substances cannot be\ncomposed of anything except particular forms and matter, whereas\nuniversals are composed of a genus and specific difference as well as\nby any other universal form above the genus. Consequently, the lowest\nspecies is not a constitutive part of the individuals in which it is\npresent and of which it is predicated, but only a form coming together\nwith their essences, making their metaphysical structure known\n(EP, ch. de substantia, fol. 23rb\u2013va). Hence, Burley\nsharply distinguishes between two main kinds of substantial form: one\nsingular (forma perficiens materiam) and the other universal\n(forma declarans quidditatem). The former affects (a\nparticular) matter and, together with it, brings the substantial\ncomposite (or hoc aliquid) into existence. The latter, the\nlowest species, discloses the nature of the particular substance in\nwhich it exists and of which it is predicated, but it is not one of\nits constituent parts. So particular substances are in and of\nthemselves really distinct from their species and from each other.\nEvery individual really differs from its species because the latter is\nnot part of its essence, but a form existing in it, as well as really\ndistinct from other individuals belonging to the same species because\nof its own particular form and matter (EIs, ch. de\nspecie, fol. 10va; EP, chs., de substantia,\nfol. 23va\u2013b; de quantitate, fol. 31rb; see also Tractatus\nde formis, pp. 9\u201310). Secondary substances belong to the\ncategory of substance only insofar as they are predicated of the\nessence of particular substances (in quid) (EP, ch.\nde substantia, fol. 22ra), whereas particular substantial\nforms and particular matter do not properly belong to the category of\nsubstance because they do not fulfill the above conditions for being a\nsubstance (EP, ch. de substantia, fol. 22ra).\nBurley\u2019s exposition here amounts to equating the essence of a thing,\nits forma totius (qua really different from the forma\npartis), and its universal (or secondary) substance (namely, the\nspecies of the thing at issue) with one another. The essence so viewed\nincludes substantial form and matter in equal measure. It is\ninterpreted as the main common, immanent form of a certain set of\nindividuals and represents the unchanging and basic properties of that\nset of things. Although the essence is one and the same item in all\nthe singulars of which it is predicated, it is not one in number, but\none according to the species (una et eadem res secundum\nspeciem). It has some sort of unity and identity other than\nnumerical, specifies Burley. As a consequence, it can be present in\ndifferent places, say in Rome and in Oxford, at the same time, since\nthis is compatible with its other-than-numerical unity. The unity of\nthe essence is a transcendental (and so trans-categorial and merely\nintelligible) and not a numerical (i.e, quantitative) unity.\nTherefore, universal essences cannot be counted with their\nindividuals.\n\nBurley uses the standard 13th-century division of\nuniversals into ante rem, in re, and post\nrem (LsP, ch. de forma, fol. 53rb;\nTdU, passim), but he follows Auriol and the earlier\nOckham in positing another mental universal, distinct from the act of\nunderstanding (the \u2018standard\u2019 post rem conceptual\nuniversal), and existing in the mind only as its object (habens\nesse obiectivum in intellectu\u2014EP, ch. de\npriori, fol. 48vb; TdU, pp. 60\u201366). By introducing\na second mental universal existing obiective in the mind,\nBurley hopes to account for the fact that we can grasp the meaning of\na general noun even though we have not experienced any of its\nsupposits, and thus without properly knowing the universal it directly\nsignifies.\n\nBurley identifies secondary substance with the quale quid and\nprimary substance with the hoc aliquid, but quale\nquid and hoc aliquid are what are signified by general\nand discrete nouns, respectively, of the category (EP, ch.\nde substantia, fols. 25vb\u201326ra). Therefore, he argues that\nsecondary substances are metaphysical entities existing outside our\nminds that are necessary conditions for our language to be meaningful,\nas general names would be meaningless if they did not signify\nsomething that both exists in reality, and have the peculiar feature\nof being common to (i.e., present in) many individual things. Only by\nassociating general names with such objects as their proper\nsignificatum did Burley think we could explain how a general\nname can stand for many things at once and name all of them in the\nsame way. According to him, a general name supposits for and names\n(appellare) a set of individual things only through the\ncommon nature or universal which it directly signifies and which is\npresent in that set of individuals (EP, ch. de\nsubstantia, fol. 26ra). Since common natures connect general\nnames with their extensions by determining the class(es) of the things\nto which they are correctly applied, and since they are what general\nnames stand for when they have simple supposition (see De\npuritate, tr. 1\u00b0, pars 1a, ch. 3, pp. 7\u20139),\nthey are actually the intensions of general names\u2014or rather,\nthe hypostatizations of these intensions, seeing that they are\nindependent entities existing outside our minds. On the other hand,\nfrom a merely ontological point of view, universals and particulars\nare connected by the relation of instantiation, so that primary\nsubstances are tokens of secondary substances, since each particular\ninstantiates its associated universal and is recognizable as a token\nof a given type by virtue of its conformity to it and its likeness to\nother particular substances (EP, ch. de substantia,\nfol. 26ra\u2013b). Therefore, in Burley\u2019s system, common natures (i.e.,\nuniversals) and particulars (or simple objects) are related both as\nintensions to extensions and as types to tokens. A certain type or\nuniversal is nothing but the intension of a general name when it is\nconsidered in relation to the extension itself, and conversely, the\nextension of a general name (i.e., a class of individuals) is nothing\nbut the set of tokens of a given type considered in relation to the\nsimple expressions that name them. Thus, the relation holding between\nthe intension and extension of a term is the same as between types and\ntokens. It is a sort of categorization, which can be described in\nterms of the elaboration and acquisition of patterns of\nidentification. Moreover, since Burley now admits two kinds of mental\nuniversals, the first of which is an act of understanding and the\nsecond of which is the object of the former (i.e., its semantic\ncontent apprehended by the mind), the intension and the extension of a\ngeneral term (i.e., the universal nature and the individuals which\ninstantiate it), considered together, are the significatum of\nthe general term, while the concept habens esse obiectivum in\nintellectu provides its sense, or cognitive meaning. Therefore,\naccording to Burley\u2019s final view, the sense/significatum\ndichotomy is not equivalent to the intension/extension dichotomy, the\nlatter being a sub-division of the former. This result makes his\ntheory of meaning very similar to the one developed recently by R.\nCann (Formal Semantics, Cambridge 1993; see especially pp.\n10\u201312; 215\u2013224; and 263\u201369).\n\nAn analogous schema holds for complex expressions, since Burley adds a\nfifth kind of proposition to the ones he recognized before,\ncorrelating them in a similar way, since he now admits spoken,\nwritten, two kinds of mental, and real propositions.\n\nAs we saw above, the distinction between simple and complex objects,\nor (roughly) between objects and states of affairs, is fundamental to\nBurley\u2019s ontology. This distinction is the objective counterpart of\nthe linguistic distinction between simple and compound expressions\n(i.e., nouns vs. sentences or propositions). Thus, Burley can view\nstates of affairs as propositions existing in re. In the\nprologue to his final commentary on the Categories, he claims\nthat a mental proposition is what is signified by a spoken (or\nwritten) sentence. The mental proposition in turn signifies something\nelse, because it is composed of concepts, which are themselves signs.\nAs a result, the ultimate significatum of this chain must be\nsomething that is signified but does not signify, and which has the\nsame logical structure as the mental proposition\u2014i.e., it must\nbe a proposition in re (fols. 17vb\u201318ra; see also ch. de\npriori, fol. 47va). Such a real proposition is an ens\ncopulatum formed by the entity for which the subject and the\npredicate stand together with an identity-relation, if the proposition\nis affirmative, or a non-identity relation, if the proposition is\nnegative (EP, prooem., fol. 18va; EPh,\nprol., fol. 66ra\u2013b). These complex objects differ from\naggregates (the significata of concrete accidental terms),\nwhich are also made up of items belonging to different categories\nsince mere aggregates do not include the identity (or non-identity)\nrelation, and, like simple objects, cannot be true nor false\n(EP, ch. de oppositione, fol. 45va). In the chapter\nde priori, he maintains that there are four kinds of\nproposition, written, spoken, mental, and real, and specifies that the\nmental proposition is twofold: the first, existing in the mind as in a\nsubject (habens esse subiectivum in intellectu), is composed\nof acts of understanding; the second, existing in the mind as the\nobject of the preceding complex act of understanding (habens esse\nobiectivum in intellectu), is what we grasp by means of the mind\nand compare with reality to determine the truth or falsity of a\nproposition. This is the semantic link between the written, spoken,\nand (first) mental propositions on the one hand, and the real\nproposition (the state of affairs) they signify on the other. It\nexists even if the written, spoken, and (first) mental propositions\nare false and nothing corresponds to them in reality (fol. 48vb).\nAccordingly, the proposition habens esse obiectivum in\nintellectu is now the sense of a sentence, and not its extension.\nOn the other side, the new real proposition is the\nsignificatum of the sentence and its truth-maker, since those\nsentences that signify a complex object existing in reality are true,\nwhereas those sentences that do not signify such a complex object, but\nto which only the two (simple) objects designated by the subject and\npredicate correspond in reality, are false.\n\nThe problems connected with his first theory of the semantics of\npropositions are thereby solved. The real proposition of his first\ntheory is split into the mental proposition habens esse obiectivum\nin intellectu and the (new) proposition in re, both of\nwhich have a well-defined semantic and ontological status. In\naddition, false propositions have meaning (i.e., the mental\nproposition habens esse obiectivum in intellectu), but no\nreference, as no real proposition matches them. However, a new\nquestion could arise: if universals and singulars, and the ten\ncategories, are really distinct, how can Burley maintain that there\nmust be an identity relation holding between the things signified by\nthe subject and predicate of every true affirmative sentence?\n\nBurley\u2019s solution is the same as in his first version of the theory:\nin a true, affirmative statement, the significata of the\nsubject and predicate are different, but the things for which they\nstand in personal supposition (i.e., the individual substance or\nsubstances) are the same (EP, prooem., fol. 18va;\nch. de relatione, fol. 37ra; EPh, prol.,\nfol. 66ra\u2013b). This obviously implies that an affirmative proposition\nis true if and only if its extremes have personal supposition for the\nsame thing or things. For example, \u2018Sortes est\nhomo\u2019 (\u2018Socrates is a man\u2019) is true if and only\nif \u2018homo\u2019 in this context has personal\nsupposition for Socrates, that is, if the abstract form of humanity\n(humanitas) is present in Socrates. In this way, the real\ndistinction between universals and particulars, and among the ten\ncategories, is safe, without affecting his theories of correspondence\nand identity.\n\nComplex objects (or states of affairs\u2014Burley\u2019s\npropositiones in re, the ultimate significatum of a\nwritten, spoken or mental proposition) and what we have called\n\u2018aggregates\u2019 (the significatum of a concrete\naccidental term) are not identical with macro-objects, but definite\naspects of them. An aggregate is nothing but the union of one of the\ncountless accidental forms of a macro-object with its primary\nsubstance, and a complex object is the union of two forms of a\nmacro-object (one of which, i.e., the one designated directly or\nindirectly by the subject-term of the proposition, must be\nsubstantial) with and by means of the primary substance. This\nis trivially true not only for propositions in re, such as\nhominem esse animal (man being an animal) or hominem esse\nalbum (man being white)\u2014where the two connected forms are\nhumanity and animality or whiteness respectively, and where what\nunites them is each particular substance that instantiates both of\nthem in the case of man being animal, and which instantiates\nthe form of humanity and is the substrate of inherence of the\nform of whiteness in the case of man being white\u2014but\nalso for propositions in re, such as Sortem esse\nhominem (Socrates being a man). In this case, the two forms\ninvolved are the forma perficiens materiam of Socrates (i.e.,\nhis soul) and the related but distinct forma declarans\nquidditatem (i.e., the species man). What unites them is Socrates\nhimself, since he has the forma perficiens materiam as an\nessential element and instantiates the forma declarans\nquidditatem.\n7. The \u201cPlatonic\u201d turn (after 1324): the \u2018regional\u2019 ontologies\n\nSince Burley conceives of primary substances as the ultimate\nsubstrates of existence and subjects of predication in relation to\nanything else (EP, ch. de substantia, fols. 24va\u2013b,\nand 25va), the only way to demonstrate the reality of beings in other\ncategories is to treat them as forms and attributes of substances.\nSince Burley wanted to preserve the reality of quantity and its real\ndistinction from substances and other accidents, he insists that\nquantity is a form inherent in the material part of a composite\nsubstance (EP, ch. de quantitate, fol. 29rb). This\nis problematic, however, for if the highest genus of the category is a\nform, Aristotle\u2019s seven species of quantity (line, surface, solid,\ntime, space, number, and speech), mentioned in the sixth chapter of\nthe Categories, are not. Burley tries to meet this difficulty\nby reformulating the notion of a quantified thing (quantum).\nEncouraged by the Aristotelian distinction between strict and\nderivative quantities (Categories 6, 5a38\u2013b10), he\ndistinguishes two different modes of being quantified: in-itself\n(per se) and in-virtue-of-something-else (per\naccidens). The seven species of quantity are quantified by\nthemselves, whereas other quantified things (e.g., corporeal\nsubstances) are quantified in virtue of one or more of the seven\nspecies (EP, ch. de quantitate, fol. 29va). In other\nwords, Burley considers the seven species not as quantitative forms,\nbut as the most proper and primary bearers (supposita) of the\nquantitative properties revealed by the supreme genus of the category.\nAny other kind of quantified thing is simply a subject\n(subiectum) of quantitative forms.\n\nAnother distinguishing mark of quantity is its characteristic\n(proprium). In the Categories (6, 6a26\u201335),\nAristotle identified it through the fact that only quantities are said\nto be equal or unequal. Burley does not wholly agree with him because\nquanta per accidens also are said to be equal or unequal,\nthough in a derivative way (EP, ch. de quantitate,\nfol. 32rb). Thus, Burley turns to two texts from Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics (books V, ch. 13 and X, ch. 1) for an alternative\naccount of the proprium of quantity as the measure of what is\nquantified (EP, ch. de quantitate, fol. 28rb).\nMoreover he employs this property as the common principle from which\nthe seven species of quantity can be derived (EP, ch. de\nquantitate, fol. 30ra). In this way, he tries to show that the\ncategory of quantity, like that of substance, has an ordered internal\nstructure, and he reasserts the reality and real distinction of\nquantity against authors such as Peter Olivi and Ockham, who had\nattempted to reduce quantity to an aspect of material substance.\nBurley quotes at length from Ockham\u2019s commentary on the\nCategories (ch. 10, \u00a7 4), where the Franciscan master\ntries to demonstrate that quantity is really nothing distinct from\nsubstance and quality. He then proceeds to reject Ockham\u2019s arguments\n(EP, ch. de quantitate, fol. 30rb\u2013vb).\n\nOckham had claimed that it was superfluous to posit quantitative forms\nreally distinct from substance and quality, since quantity presupposes\nwhat it is intended to explain, i.e., the extension of material\nsubstances and their having parts outside parts. As an accident,\nquantity presupposes substance as its substrate of inherence. Burley\ndenies that material substances can be extended without the presence\nof quantitative forms, thereby affirming their necessity. He admits\nthat the existence of any quantity always implies the existence of a\nsubstance, but he also believes that the actual existence of parts of\na substance necessarily implies the presence of a quantitative form in\nit. He does not provide any sound metaphysical reason for this\npreference. But it makes sense when one considers his semantic theory,\naccording to which reality is the interpretative pattern of\n(philosophical) language, so that the structure of language is a\nmirroring of reality. In Burley\u2019s opinion, therefore, abstract terms\nin the category of quantity (such as \u2018extension\u2019,\n\u2018duration\u2019, \u2018magnitude\u2019, and so on) must\ncorrespond to realities in the world that are distinct from those\nsignified by the abstract substantial terms.\n\nAs we have seen, Burley thinks that what falls under any categorial\nfield are simple accidental forms; therefore, the things of the ad\naliquid category are relations (relationes) and not\nrelatives (relativa or ad aliquid), which are merely\naggregates formed by a substance and a relation. Accordingly, the\nrelationship between relation and relatives is like that between\nquantity and what is quantified, or quality and what is qualified. The\nrelation is the cause of the nature of the aggregate (that is, the\nrelatives), of which it is a constituent. Unlike modern logicians,\nBurley denies that a relation is a two-place predicate, and views it\ninstead as a monadic function, arguing that like the other accidental\nforms, relation inheres in a single substrate and makes reference to\nanother thing without inhering in it. This thesis is based on the\nfollowing principle, which Burley states in his commentary on the\nBook of Six Principles (LsP, ch. de habitu,\nfol. 63ra): there must always be equivalence and correspondence\nbetween the accidental form and its substrate of inherence, so that no\naccidental form can completely inhere at the same time in two or more\ndifferent substrates\u2014not even numbers, the different parts of\nwhich inhere in their own distinct substrates. Unlike other accidental\nforms, however, relations do not directly inhere in their substrates,\nbut are present in them only by means of another accidental form that\nBurley calls the foundation of the relation (fundamentum\nrelationis\u2014EP, ch. de relatione, fol.\n34va). Among the nine categories of accidents, only quantity, quality,\naction, and affection can be the foundations of relations.\n\nConsequently, Burley claims that in the act of referring one substance\nto another we can distinguish five constitutive elements: (1) the\nrelation itself (e.g., the form of paternity); (2) the substrate of\nthe relation, i.e., the substance that denominatively receives the\nname of the relation (the animal which begets another similar to\nitself); (3) the foundation (fundamentum) of the relation,\ni.e., the absolute entity in virtue of which the relation inheres in\nthe substrate and makes reference to another substance (in this case,\nthe generative power); (4) the antecedent term (terminus a\nquo) of the relation, i.e., the substrate of inherence of the\nrelation considered as the subject of that relation (the father); and\n(5) the consequent term (terminus ad quem) of the relation,\ni.e., the substance with which the substrate of the relation is\nconnected, considered as the object with which the antecedent term is\ncorrelated (in our example, the son). The foundation is the main\ncomponent, since it joins the relation to the underlying substances,\npermits the relation to link the antecedent to the consequent term,\nand transmits some of its properties to the relation (EP, ch.\nde relatione, fol. 35rb\u2013vb). Even though the relation depends\nfor its existence on the foundation, its being is completely distinct\nfrom it, so that when the foundation fails the relation also fails,\nbut not vice versa (EP, ch. de relatione, fol.\n35ra).\n\nFrom this analysis Burley draws some rather important consequences\nabout the nature and ontological status of relations and relatives:\n(1) the existence relations have is feebler than that of any other\naccident, as it depends upon the simultaneous existence of three\ndifferent things: the substrate, the consequent term, and the\nfoundation; (2) relations do not add any absolute perfection to the\nsubstances in which they occur; (3) relations can inhere in substances\nwithout any change in the latter, through a change in the consequent\nterm of the relation (e.g., given two things, one white and the other\nblack, if the black thing becomes white then because of the change, a\nnew accident, a relation of similarity, will inhere in the other\nwithout any other change in it; (4) there are two main kinds of\nrelatives: real (secundum esse) and linguistic (secundum\ndici). Linguistic relatives (such as \u2018knowledge\u2019 and\n\u2018knowable\u2019) are connected only by the mutual reference of\nthe nouns signifying them. Real relatives are linked as well by a\nrelation which inheres in one of them and entails a real reference to\nthe other. Linguistic relatives in reality belong to the category of\nquality. Real relatives are aggregates compounded by a substance and a\nrelation, so that they fall under the category of relation only\nindirectly (per reductionem) because of their accidental\nform. Finally (5), all true relatives are simultaneous by nature\n(simul natura), so Aristotle was wrong in denying that some\npairs of relatives are mutually simultaneous, but one prior and the\nother posterior. In fact, the real cause of being a relative is the\nrelation, which at the same time inheres in one thing and entails a\nreference to the other, thereby making both things relatives\n(EP, ch. de relatione, fols. 32va\u2013b, 34ra,\n37ra).\n\nAmong the \u2018regional\u2019 ontologies Burley developed in his\nfinal commentary on the Ars Vetus, the one which deals with\nthe categorial field of quality is, in many ways, the least complex\nand problematic. Here Burley follows the Aristotelian doctrine very\nclosely, does not argue against Ockham, and sometimes offers rather\nsuperficial analyses.\n\nThe main topics he deals with are: (1) the internal structure of the\ncategory; (2) the relationship between quality and what is qualified\n(quale); (3) the nature of the four species of quality\nAristotle lists in the Categories (states and dispositions,\nnatural capacities or incapacities to do or suffer something,\naffective qualities and affections, shapes and external forms); and\n(4) the distinctive characteristic (proprium) of the category\nof quality, i.e., the fact that two or more things can be described as\nsimilar only because of quality and in respect of it. We will\nfocus on the first two only, since the questions they raise are more\ngeneral.\n\nFollowing the opinion of Duns Scotus (q. 36 of his Quaestiones in\nlibrum Praedicamentorum\u2014Questions on the Book of the\nCategories), Burley maintains that the four \u2018species\u2019\nof quality mentioned by Aristotle are not properly species but modes\n(modi) of quality. That is because unlike real species, they\nare not completely separate classifications, since many things\nbelonging to the first species also belong to the second and/or the\nthird (EP, ch. de qualitate, fol. 38vb).\n\nAs far as the nature of qualia and their relation to quality\nare concerned, Burley thinks that qualia are aggregates\ncomposed of a substance and a quality inhering in it. They do not\nbelong to any categorial field because they lack in real unity.\nNevertheless, since they are qualia in virtue of a\nqualitative form, they can be included in the category of quality\nindirectly (per reductionem\u2014EP, ch. de\nqualitate, fol. 41rb). Qualia share qualities to\ndifferent degrees. While no qualitative form admits of more or less,\ntheir substrates of inherence do (EP, ch. de\nqualitate, fol. 41vb). In this way, Burley advances two important\ntheses of his metaphysics as logical corollaries of his theories of\nuniversals and substances: (1) no universal form can be shared in\ndifferent degrees by the individual instantiating it; (2) no\nindividual form can be subject to change, except, of course, through\ngeneration and corruption.\n8. The theories of knowledge\n\nDuring his long career, Walter Burley worked out two different\naccounts of the standard realist theory of knowledge, both of which\nare critical of the most common theories of his time. Burley himself\nplaces much more stress on the question of the proper object of human\nknowledge and the intellective cognition of individuals. The first\naccount is developed in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De\nanima (before 1316), and the second in the prologue of his last\ncommentary on the Physics (around 1324).\n\nIn the commentary on De anima, Burley deals with the problems\nof the object of knowledge and the possibility of direct intellective\ncognition of singulars, especially in questions 5 and 6 of Book III:\n\u201cutrum intellectus intelligat singulare [Does the\nintellect understand what is singular]?\u201d and \u201cutrum\nuniversale sit obiectum intellectus [Is what is universal an\nobject of the intellect]?\u201d (fols. 69rb\u201370va). In order to answer\nthese two questions, Burley, like Averroes, begins by distinguishing\nthree different aspects and one state of the soul which can be\ndesignated by the term \u2018intellect\u2019: the elementary thought\n(virtus cogitativa\u2014which, for Burley, as for Thomas\nAquinas and Giles of Rome, is a purely sensory faculty); the active\nintellect; the possible intellect (which, following Averroes\u2019s\nterminology, Burley calls \u201cmaterialis\u201d); and the\nintellect in habitu, i.e., that state of the intellect in\nwhich, thanks to the union of the active intellect with the material\nintellect, an intelligible species comes into being in the material\nintellect, generating an effective act of cognition. Since, in\nBurley\u2019s view, both the active intellect and the intellect in\nhabitu are not strictly speaking faculties of the soul, but the\nprimary cause of understanding and a state of the soul, respectively,\nit is necessary for him to offer two distinct accounts depending on\nwhether it is the elementary thought or the material intellect which\nis in question. In the first case, the material singular is the direct\nand sufficient object of the intellect, insofar as elementary thought,\nlike common sense and imagination, is directed exclusively towards\nindividuals, both substantial and accidental. But in the second case,\nit is the universal that is the direct and appropriate object of the\nintellect, because the intentional representation (species or\nintentio) produced by the singular in the soul is not formed\nor \u2018taken in\u2019 by the material intellect, as the only\nspecies present in the material intellect is the universal.\nNevertheless, Burley acknowledges that the material intellect also has\nknowledge of the singular in an indirect and derivative way\n(indirecte et ex consequenti). Accordingly, he disagrees with\nthose authors who, on the basis of the Aristotelian assertion that\n\u201csensation is of singulars; but understanding is of\nuniversals\u201d, affirm that the singular cannot in any way be the\nobject of intellective knowledge. According to Burley, what the\nAristotle means is that the senses can grasp directly and\nappropriately only the singular, whereas the universal can be known in\na direct and proper manner only by the material intellect (cf. also\nIn De an., I, q.5: \u201cutrum intelligere sit propria\noperatio animae vel totius coniuncti [Is understanding the proper\nactivity of the soul or of the entire conjunct <of body and\nsoul>?\u201d, fol. 13va; and De potentiis animae, p.\n111). What is more, were the material intellect unable to know the\nsingular, it would be impossible for us to distinguish what is\nindividual from what is universal. As a matter of fact, even though\nthe species present in the material intellect is universal, and cannot\nby itself point to any particular individual, the material intellect\ncan know the singular by means of intentional representations\n(phantasma) present in the elementary thought, since the\nphantasm is nothing but the intentional representation of a single\nindividual substance obtained through the accidental properties it\nexhibits. Thanks to such a representation the (material) intellect can\nassimilate itself in the act of knowing to singular things attested to\nby the senses.\n\nBut Burley\u2019s explanation, however interesting, has a weak point, since\nit does not clarify how it is possible for the material intellect to\nknow an individual existing outside our mind by means of a singular\nintentional representation that is not present in it, but in\nelementary thought. The solution to this problem lies in what he says\nin the aformentioned q.5 of Book I, as well as in q.10 of Book III\n(\u201cutrum intellectus materialis copuletur nobis solum per\nphantasma [Is the material intellect joined to us only through an\nimage]?\u201d, fol. 76va\u2013b), concerning the problem of the union\n(copulatio) of singular human beings with the material\nintellect, which is assumed to be separate and unique for the whole\nhuman species. In his view, the material intellect is by nature united\nwith human individuals from birth, as the perfection of their being.\nBut a further kind of union takes place when the material intellect\nperforms an act of understanding (in operando), i.e., when\nthe active intellect illumines both the phantasm and the material\nintellect, thereby impressing on the latter the species\nintelligibilis abstracted from the former\u2014intelligible\nspecies by means of which the material intellect can grasp the common\nnature of the singular substance which began the process of knowing.\nThis close connection between the phantasm and the intelligible\nspecies (which originates from it) is why (1) the material intellect\ncan know singulars through a representation that is not properly\npresent in it; and conversely, (2) the elementary thought can know,\nindirectly and derivatively, common natures (or universals)\n(\u201chomo per virtutem cogitativam potest cognoscere\nuniversalia et quidditates rerum\u201d, fol. 13va), even though\nits proper and adequate object is the singular.\n\nThis account of the knowing process provides a twofold origin of human\nknowledge: the first empirical, from the senses; the other\ntranscendental, from the active intellect. On the one hand, the\nexternal and internal senses collect, decode, and elaborate\ninformation that comes from a singular material thing present to the\nsenses. The result is the formation of a phantasm of a thing. On the\nother hand, the active intellect impresses on the material intellect\nthe intelligible species, when the phantasm inhering in the elementary\nthought is presented to the material intellect itself. Intellection\nseems thus to consist in the matching, so to speak, of a phantasm with\nan intelligible species, a sort of classification of world items, in\nvirtue of which any given singular item is referred back to its type.\nThis entails that for Burley, the cognitive process is aimed at the\nsecond operation of the intellect, namely judgment (e.g.,\n\u201cSortes est homo\u201d), and not simply to\nabstraction, since it is by means of judgment that the intellect\nsubsumes a given token (the material thing) under its type (the\nnatural species). This fact also explains why the answer to the\nquestion concerning the proper object of the intellect is\ncomplicated.\n\nAs far as the problem of the primary object of knowledge is concerned,\nin the commentary on the De anima, Burley distinguishes (1) a\ntriple mode in which something can be the primary object of the\nintellect: by origin (via generationis), by intrinsic\nperfection (via perfectionis), and by proportion (via\nadaequationis); and (2) two different kinds of knowledge:\nanalytic (distincta) and vague (confusa). From the\npoint of view of analytic knowledge, i.e., adequately articulated and\ndeveloped knowledge, being is the first object of the intellect by\norigin. But from the point of view of vague knowledge, i.e., knowledge\nwhich is not yet articulated and developed, the first objects of the\nintellect by origin are the universals corresponding to those\nindividuals perceived by our senses. The first object of the intellect\nby intrinsic perfection is the first cause from the perspective of\nabsolute perfection; but in terms of relative perfection, it is the\nuniversal which corresponds to the individual present to our senses.\nFinally, the object by proportion of a given faculty is that item\nunder which all things known by that faculty fall. In the case of the\nintellect, being in its widest generality is such, as only that which\nis can be known. \n\nMoreover, Burley also distinguishes between the object which gives\nrise to the process of knowledge (obiectum motivum) and the\nobject that contains within itself all known things (obiectum\ncontentivum). The first is always singular, whereas the second is\nalways universal. In other words, what we come to know is a common\nnature, but this is possible just because there are particular things\nthat strike our senses (fol. 70ra\u2013b). \n\nAlthough Burley seems to accept the existence of a separate material\nintellect, unique to the whole human species, he emphasizes the fact\nthat without the contribution of elementary thought, which provides us\nwith the phantasm, the material intellect cannot be united to the\nactive intellect in knowing. It is true that individual men could not\nreach an intellective knowledge of anything without the material\nintellect; but it is also true that the material intellect on its own,\nor with the mere contribution of the active intellect, would not be\ncapable of elaborating any form of knowledge.\n\nThis particular reconstruction of the process of knowledge is\njustified at the ontological level too. Burley\u2019s earlier view about\nthe metaphysical composition of corporeal beings accounts for the way\nhe approaches questions concerning knowledge. He claims that corporeal\nbeings are constituted by an individual substance and a host of\naccidental forms inhering in it. Individual substance is then the\nresult of the union of particular matter and form (cf. Quaestiones\nin librum Perihermeneias, q.4, p. 272). Particular form is itself\nconstituted by a specific form (that is, the essence of the singular\nthing at issue) and by all of its metaphysical constituents. As we\nhave already seen, it is precisely in the commentary on the De\nanima (Book I, q.3) that Burley affirms that universals in the\ncategory of substance are constitutive parts in the essence of their\nindividuals, and have being in their individuals. All of this enables\nus to understand better why in his De anima commentary,\nBurley grants some level of intelligibility to singulars as such,\nthough indirectly and derivatively, and also why he describes\nelementary knowledge in terms of a classification of things according\nto which a given singular object is referred back to its ideal\ntype.\n\nNonetheless, about ten years later, in the prologue to his last\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Physics, Burley completely reversed\nhis position on knowledge. In partial agreement with Thomas Wilton,\nwho had been his socius in Paris, he maintained that our\nintellect is capable of knowing singulars qua singulars (sub\npropria ratione singularis) primarily and directly (primo et\ndirecte), and not simply as items belonging to a certain species\nor type. Indeed, he now argued that the universal can be grasped by\nthe intellect indirectly and by reflection (In Phys. I, fol.\n10va), an openly anti-Avverroistic statement which would steer him\ncloser to Ockhamist nominalism, were it not for his denial of any form\nof intuitionism. \n\nIn his discussion of the question, \u201cutrum magis universalia\nsint nobis prius nota quam minus universalia vel quam singularia\n[Is what is more universal more known to us than what is less\nuniversal, or than singulars]?\u201d (fol. 9va\u2013b), Burley deals once\nagain with the problems of the intelligibility of singulars and the\nobject of our knowledge. The question arises from the passage in the\nPhysics (I.1, 184a23\u201324), where Aristotle affirms that\nour knowledge must proceed from what is universal to what is\nparticular (or singular). According to Burley, it is false that what\nis more universal is known by us before (prius nota) what is\nless universal, as Thomas Aquinas had taught. Anyone who holds this,\nhe argues, implicitly assumes that the passage from ignorance to\nperfect cognition (notitia perfecta) is mediated by the\nknowledge of all the substantial forms of the object in question, from\nthe more general to the more particular. But this assumes that in\norder to know something, it is necessary to know everything that can\nbe predicated of it. This seems false to Burley, since it is openly\ncontradicted by experience: e.g., a person can know that the animal\nstanding in front of him is a horse, and what a horse is, without\nknowing all the other universal forms that are predicated of it (fol.\n9vb). A cognition of the latter kind is almost impossible, for it\nwould be necessary to acquire systematic knowledge of all animal\nspecies and of any possible grouping they could form\u2014something\nthat no human being can achieve (fols. 9vb\u201310ra). Nor is Burley\nconvinced by Ockham\u2019s interpretation of this passage in the latter\u2019s\ncommentary on the Physics (cf. Expositio in libros\nPhysicorum Aristotelis I, c.1, \u00a72, O.Ph. IV,\n24\u201325), according to which the Aristotelian principle applies\nonly to complex knowledge and referring to humanity as a whole,\nalthough for each of us taken singularly the contrary is true, because\nthe object of our simple and exhaustive knowledge (notita\nincomplexa perfecta) is the singular. Burley contends that what\nis true for individual human beings must also be true for humanity as\na whole, and therefore that at the level of human species as well, the\nknowledge of what is less universal comes before the knowledge of what\nis more universal (cf. fol. 10rb). \n\nBurley concludes this first part of his discussion, devoted to the\nanalysis and refutation of the opinions of Aquinas and Ockham, with a\nremark concerning the way in which general concepts are structured and\nrelated one to another. He presents a categorization of the different\ntypes of knowledge and reappraises to some extent the role of\ndefinition in knowledge. Burley affirms that the more universal\nconcepts are not closely connected with less universal concepts; they\ndo not form a logically or essentially ordered (essentialiter\nordinata) series. Definition provides us with better knowledge of\na thing than the knowledge we acquire from the mere apprehension of\nits name; nevertheless, the simple cognition which derives from the\nconfused and indistinct knowledge of the nominal notion of a given\nthing is sufficient for all practical purposes, and prior by origin to\nthe knowledge which results from its definition, as what is more\nsimple is prior to what is less simple. Thus, for Burley, we first\ngrasp the meaning of simple terms and then that of composite\nexpressions such as definitions. However, from the point of view of\nquantity of information or exhaustiveness, the most perfect definition\n(perfectissima definitio), i.e., the definition enumerating\nall four causes of the definiendum and not just its proximate genus\n(material cause) and specific difference (formal cause), is superior\nto any other form of knowledge (fol. 6rb). \n\nIn this (new) discussion of the nature of human knowledge, Burley\ndistinguishes between complex cognition (notitia complexa)\nand simple cognition (notitia incomplexa) (cf. fols. 5va\u2013b),\nas well as between two different types of exhaustive complex cognition\n(notitia perfecta complexa): (i) absolute\n(simpliciter) and (ii) relative to the general kind of thing\nin question (in genere) (see fols. 5vb\u20136ra). He also\ndistinguishes between appropriate (distincta) (or perfectly\nappropriate\u2014distinctissima) cognition and discrete or\ndiscriminative cognition (distinctive seu discretiva) (cf.\nfols. 10vb\u201311ra). A complex cognition of a thing is contained in and\nmanifested by one or more statements about it, both affirmative and\nnegative (fol. 5va). A simple cognition, on the other hand, is\ncontained in and manifested by simple concepts and expressions, namely\nterms (fol. 5vb). Complex exhaustive cognition simpliciter is\nwhat enables us to know all the intrinsic constitutive principles of a\nthing along with all the essential predicates and characteristic\nfeatures (propria) associated with these principles\nthemselves. Relative exhaustive complex cognition is what makes\npossible for us to know all the essential predicates and all the\ncharacteristic features associated with them in relation only to the\nnatural species (or type) of a thing (fol. 6ra). We have an\nappropriate cognition of a thing when we are able to list most of its\nconstitutive elements, and a perfectly appropriate knowledge when we\ncan specify all of its constituent elements (fol. 10vb). Finally, we\nhave discriminative knowledge of a thing when we are able to\ndistinguish the thing at issue from other similar things by virtue of\none or more peculiar aspects which make it different from all others\nof the same kind (fol. 11ra).\n\nKeeping these distinctions in mind, we can now move on to examine how\nBurley articulates his solution to the problem of the object of human\nknowledge. According to him, determining whether what is more\nuniversal is known by us before what is less universal is equivalent\nto establishing what is the primary and direct object by origin of\nconfused and appropriate cognitions. He thinks that from the point of\nview of the origin of our confused knowledge, the intellect grasps\nfirst what is singular. The argumentation he develops to support this\nclaim is articulated in two stages: (1) he demonstrates that the\nintellect is able to know what is singular, since it can easily\ndistinguish universals from singulars. If the intellect were unable to\nknow singulars, it would be impossible for it to distinguish what is\nuniversal from what is singular. This was the most important proof\nthat he had utilized in his De anima commentary to\ndemonstrate that the material intellect has some kind of singular\nknowledge, however indirect and derivative. Next, (2) he proves that\nthe primary object by way of generation (via generationis) of\nconfused knowledge is the singular, as it would be otherwise\nimpossible to explain how the intellect can obtain some kind of\nsingular knowledge on the basis of previous universal knowledge. If we\nknew what is universal before what is singular, we could never acquire\nknowledge of any singular, given that the universal species cannot\ndirect our intellect toward any particular individual, since it is\ntied to each individual by the same relation of similarity (fol.\n11rb). \n\nIn the De anima commentary, this remark did not prevent\nBurley from stating the exact opposite of what he intends to prove\nhere. He had held that the (material) intellect does not know\nsingulars through universal species, but through the intentional\nrepresentation of a given singular present in the elementary thought\nand accessible to the intellect only at the moment of the active union\nof a single individual man with the material and active intellects in\nthe soul. This means that the complex explanation of the process and\nnature of human knowledge developed in the De anima\ncommentary is completely rejected here, and replaced by a new theory\nmodelled not on Averroes\u2019s commentary but on Burley\u2019s own semantic and\nontological program. What is more, in Burley\u2019s new way of thinking,\nthe intellect does know the universal only by abstraction from\nsingulars; but abstraction always proceeds from what is already known\nto what is not yet known; therefore, singulars are known by us before\nuniversals (cf. fol. 11va). It is thus not surprising that Burley\nconcludes this first part of his answer, devoted to confused\nknowledge, by supporting a thesis diametrically opposed to what was\nproposed in his De anima commentary, namely that universals\nare known by the intellect indirectly and derivatively, through\nreflection. According to Burley, our intellect grasps what is\nuniversal only after having known at least one of the corresponding\nsingulars, even though it knows the lowest species of each singular\nalmost immediately, from the singular itself, whereas all the other\nuniversals contained in the lowest species (from the proximate genus\nup to the highest genus in the category to which the singular thing\nbelongs) are known only through reflection on the lowest species\nitself. The most immediate consequences of the adoption of this view\nare (1) a new theory concerning the object of intellective knowledge,\ndifferent from that presented in Book III of his De anima\ncommentary; and (2) a new definition of the function of the active\nintellect in the process of knowledge.\n\nBurley now distinguishes a four-fold way in which something can be\nconsidered the first object of the intellect: by origin, by\nproportion, by intrinsic perfection, and by exclusion (primitate\nexclusionis)\u2014the latter being the way a determinate\nobject can be known by a certain faculty and by that faculty alone,\nexcluding all others. The singular, and not the universal, is now\nconsidered the first object of the intellect by origin\u2014which\nwas obvious from what had been stated in the previous passages. Being,\ntaken in its broadest generality, is the first object of the intellect\nby proportion, but now Burley explains that being, understood in this\nway, is equivalent to intelligible being. The first object of the\nintellect by intrinsic perfection is God. In this case as well, there\nis a rather marked difference from the De anima commentary in\nthat Burley abandons the distinction between absolute and relative\nperfection (which had enabled him, once more, to introduce the\nuniversal as primary object of the intellect), and replaces the more\nimpersonal and abstract Aristotelian first cause with God (presumably\nthe Christian God). Finally, the universal is the object of the\nintellect by exclusion insofar as the intellect is the only faculty\ncapable of knowing it. \n\nFurthermore, as far as the role of the active intellect is concerned,\nthe claim that the singular is now intelligible in principle requires\nthat the job of the active intellect should no longer be the one\ntraditionally attributed to it of removing the individuating\nconditions from the phantasm; rather, it must now act on the possible\nintellect (intellectus possibilis). The active intellect\nmakes the possible intellect move from a state of purely potential\nintellection to a state of actual intellection (given by the presence\nin it of the intelligible species)\u2014a state which the phantasm\nwould not, on its own, be able to bring about in the possible\nintellect (cf. fol. 11vb). It is worth noting Burley\u2019s change in\nterminology, from the orthodox Averroistic expression\n\u201cintellectus materialis\u201d, as it appears in the\nDe anima commentary, to the expression more commonly used by\nopponents of the Averroists: \u201cintellectus\npossibilis\u201d.\n\nThe analysis of the question of the primary and direct object by\norigin of appropriate cognition is far shorter and less problematic.\nAppropriate cognition is the knowledge we obtain once we are capable\nof enumerating in an orderly way all the elementary metaphysical\ncomponents of a thing. Consequently, the starting points of this kind\nof knowledge cannot but be the most general universals, as their\nnotions constitute the basis from which the notions of less general\nuniversals and of singulars themselves will have to be\n\u201cbuilt\u201d and understood. The reason is that what is\nsubordinated to something else cannot be known in an appropriate\nmanner if those things which are above it in the categorial hierarchy\nand which constitute its essence are not known (fols. 10vb\u201311ra).\n\nIn this way, Burley points towards a double movement in the process of\nknowing: a first movement, connected with the activity of abstraction\nor generalization of the intellect (namely, the kind of knowledge he\ncalls \u2018confused\u2019), which goes from the bottom to the top\nof the categorial hierarchy, i.e., from what is singular to the\nhighest genus. Then there is a second movement, tied to the\ndefinitional activity of the intellect (namely the knowledge that he\ncalls appropriate\u2019), which goes from top to bottom of the categorial\nhierarchy, proceeding from what is more universal and therefore\nintensionally more simple and primitive to that which is less so,\nfinally reaching singulars, which are intentionally richer and\nontologically more complex than any universal.\n\nAs we have seen, within Burley\u2019s new theory of understanding the\nsingular can be placed either at the beginning of the chain of\nknowledge, as its origin, or at its end, as its result. In both cases,\nwhat remains unchanged is that intellective knowledge is at stake and\nnot simply sense knowledge. This means that for Burley, the singular\nis one of the primary objects of the cognitive activity of the human\nintellect. This result is historically significant because it brings\nBurley\u2019s later theory of knowledge into line with the other great\nepistemological doctrines of the fourteenth century, almost all of\nwhich were aimed at re-evaluating the singular as a possible object of\nknowledge. The way for this was prepared by the ontological turn in\nBurley\u2019s last commentary on the Physics: the move from an\nontology developed according to the canons of moderate realism to the\nradically realist ontology of macro-objects, based on a real\ndistinction between universals and singulars and among the ten\nAristotelian categories. Such a conception derives from the assumption\nof a hermeneutical principle which is clearly formulated by Burley for\nthe first time in the latter work, where he observes that the causes\nof a particular effect must be particular as well, and those of a\nuniversal effect must be universal. Accordingly, he denies that a\nuniversal cause can have a particular effect and vice-versa, and\ntherefore that what is singular can be directly constituted by those\nuniversal forms placed above it in the hierarchy of categorial\npredication (cf. fol. 9rb\u2013va).\n\nAt the cognitive level, negating any real identity between universals\nand singulars (which, on the contrary, had been assumed to hold in the\nDe anima commentary) brought with it a unification of the\nlevels of knowledge (sense cognition and abstractive cognition)\nthrough the intellectualization of the knowledge of singulars and a\ndoubling of the object of knowledge (the singular and the universal).\nThis was necessary so that the real distinction between universal and\nindividual at the ontological level did not make it impossible to\nexplain how sense knowledge (fully centered on singulars) and\nintellective knowledge (centred on universals) could\n\u201cmeet\u201d in judgments concerning individuals, as in\n\u201cSocrates is a man\u201d. This was possible in the De\nanima commentary precisely because of their real identity in the\nextra-mental world of universals and individuals; once this identity\nfailed, however, there was the risk of making the passage from the\nintentional representation of singulars to the intelligible species of\nthe common nature (or universal) into a sort of arbitrary distortion\nof the data coming from reality. The relation, now more slippery and\nfragile, between the (substantial) universal and the singular required\nthat singulars be moved from the sphere of imperfect and piecemeal\nsense knowledge and made available to the cognitive faculty that is\nconcerned with universals. Indeed, in the ontology of the later\nBurley, universal substantial forms are distinguished from accidental\nforms not because their being is somehow identified with the being of\nthose singular substances which are their substrates, but because they\nalone are capable of manifesting the deep metaphysical structure of\nthe singular substances themselves. The type, which in Burley\u2019s\nearlier writings was only something exhibited by singular substances,\nis now a reality distinct from them, though not totally separated or\nexistentially independent of them. Consequently, Burley\u2019s theory ends\nup putting substantial and accidental forms on the same level, and\ncancelling every qualitative difference in predication. This makes his\nlogical system considerably different from the\nAristotelian/Neo-Platonic systems of the Middle Ages, since for the\nlatter the predicative relation of any sentence of the\nsubject/copula/predicate form had to be understood as modally\ndetermined by the particular nature of the predicable corresponding to\nthe predicate (i.e., its species, genus, difference,\nproprium, accident). On the other hand, this makes Burley\u2019s\nlogical system the medieval system that is the most similar to modern\nones.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>Expositio vetus super librum Porphyrii</em>, in M. von Perger,\n\u201cWalter Burley\u2019s <em>Expositio vetus super librum\nPorphyrii</em>.
