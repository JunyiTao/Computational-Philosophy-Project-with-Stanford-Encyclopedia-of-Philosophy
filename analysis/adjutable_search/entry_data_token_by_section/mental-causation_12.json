    "main_text": "Problem II: Anomalous Monism || Counterfactual Dependence\n5.3 Counterfactual Dependence\n\nLePore and Loewer (1987) look to counterfactuals to answer this charge\n(see also Horgan 1989; LePore and Loewer 1989; Block 1990; Loewer\n2007). The central idea is that anomalous monism permits physical\neffects to depend counterfactually on mental properties. And such\ndependence secures an important kind of causal relevance for the\nmental, the sort that LePore and Loewer call \u201cbringing\nabout\u201d. On their view, a\u2019s being F\nbrings about b\u2019s being G when the following\nconditions are met:\n\na causes b.\na is F and b is G.\nIf a had not been F, b would not have\nbeen G.\na\u2019s being F and b\u2019s being\nG are logically and metaphysically independent.\n\n\nNow suppose a mental event, such as a decision to turn on the light,\ncauses Gus to move his finger, thereby flipping the light switch. Here\nthe crucial counterfactual is: If the cause had not been a decision to\nturn on the light, the effect would not have been a switch-flipping.\nThis is plausible, as are similar counterfactuals in a wide range of\ncases. But are such counterfactuals compatible with anomalous monism?\nLePore and Loewer say Yes: while Davidson prohibits strict\nlaws connecting mental and physical properties, he apparently leaves\nroom for non-strict laws. Such laws are enough to ground or\n\u201csupport\u201d counterfactuals. Consider, by analogy, the\nproperties of being a match-striking and being a\nmatch-lighting. If there is a law connecting such properties, it\nis evidently non-strict: striking causes lighting only ceteris\nparibus. Nevertheless, we can assert with confidence, after a\ngiven lighting, that if the match had not been struck, it\nwouldn\u2019t have lit. Non-strict psychophysical laws would\nsimilarly appear to ground counterfactuals connecting mental and\nbehavioral properties.\n\nThis counterfactual defense is attractive for a number of reasons. It\ncaptures a sense in which mental properties make a difference to\nbehavior, but in a way that\u2019s apparently compatible with\nanomalous monism. It respects our causal intuitions about a wide range\nof cases. And it fits well with the more general\n counterfactual theory of causation,\n which many philosophers have found independently plausible. Moreover,\nDavidson himself seems sympathetic to the defense (Davidson 1993; but\nsee \u00a75.5).\n\nIn spite of these advantages, a worry is that the pertinent\ncounterfactuals don\u2019t after all ensure causal relevance, and in\nthis sense don\u2019t vindicate anomalous monism. This objection can\ntake the form of direct counterexamples (Braun 1995; Garrett 1999),\nbut here we look at a broader concern.\n\nWhen a counterfactual is true, there should be something in the world\nthat makes it true. Even granting that, if the cause had not had its\nmental property, the effect would not have had its behavioral\nproperty, in virtue of what is this true? This truthmaker, not the\ncounterfactual itself, is what matters in determining whether a\nproperty is causally relevant. And the worry is that once we look at\nthe truthmakers in the mental case, the threat of epiphenomenalism\ncrops up again. Although the effect counterfactually depends on the\nmental property, this is only because the mental property depends on a\nphysical property doing the real work. The mental property looks like\na freeloader (Kim 1998, pp. 70\u20133, 2007; compare Crane 2008 on a\nsimilar issue).\n\nLePore and Loewer discuss a version of this worry. Condition (3), an\nobjector might say, is too crude to test for causal relevance, for the\ncounterfactual holds only because removing F from a\nalso removes some other property F* of a, and\nit\u2019s the absence of F* that\u2019s responsible for\nb\u2019s not being G. A better counterfactual test\nevaluates the effect\u2019s status given that a is not\nF and all of a\u2019s other\nproperties\u2014or at least all that are potential causal rivals to\nF\u2014are held fixed. If b is not G in\nthat case, only then can we credit F with causal relevance.\nBut mental properties fail this more refined test. Consider again\nGus\u2019s decision to turn on the light, and remove its mental\nproperty, this time holding fixed its physical properties. It seems\nclear that he would still flip the switch. After all, the physical\nproperties of the cause figure in an exceptionless law according to\nDavidson. It looks as if the physical properties of your decision\n\u201cscreen off\u201d the mental property, making the latter\nirrelevant.\n\nLePore and Loewer concede that mental properties are screened off by\nphysical properties. But they argue that this more refined test is too\ndemanding, for it would also mean that the physical properties of a\nmental cause are irrelevant. Note in particular that the\ndecision\u2019s mental properties screen off its physical properties:\nif the cause had lacked its physical properties yet had still been a\ndecision to turn on the light, it would have caused Gus to flip the\nswitch (ceteris paribus: here a hedged law, which anomalous\nmonism permits, is in play). Screening off thus goes both ways, and\nsince few would want to deny causal relevance to the physical\nproperties, we should not let screening off impugn the significance of\nmental properties either.\n\nAntony (1991) replies that there is no symmetry here, at least not\ngiven anomalous monism. While the decision\u2019s physical properties\nscreen off its mental properties, the reverse doesn\u2019t hold.\nSuppose again that the cause had lacked its physical properties but\nhad still been a decision to turn on the light. On anomalous monism,\nAntony argues, there\u2019s no saying what Gus\u2019s decision would\nhave caused, for mental properties, being anomalous, place no\nconstraints on the causal structure of the world. (See also Leiter and\nMiller 1994.)\n\nThe freeloader problem arises in a variety of contexts in the mental\ncausation literature, not just in discussions of anomalous monism. It\nwill return under a number of guises in what follows.\n",
