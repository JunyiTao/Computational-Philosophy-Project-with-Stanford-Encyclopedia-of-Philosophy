    "main_text": "Perception\n3. Perception\n\n\nIn his early work on perception Ayer espoused a strict form of\nphenomenalism, defending the view that statements about material\nobjects are translatable into statements about actual and possible\n\u2018sense-contents\u2019. These latter statements were the\nultimate verifiers, forming the basis upon which our empirical world\nwas constructed. Although he later abandoned the reductionism inherent\nin the translatability requirement (beginning with\n\u201cPhenomenalism\u201d in 1947), believing that he had been wrong\nto think that any statement about a physical object could be entailed\nby a set of statements about sensory experience (sense-data), Ayer\ncontinued to hold that our claims about physical objects were\njustified by reference to such sensory experience. He consistently\nopposed the view, espoused by Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath, and Karl\nPopper, that the only justifiers were sentences, whether\nNeurath\u2019s \u2018protocols\u2019 or Popper\u2019s \u2018basic\nstatements\u2019. His criticism of such views was that the favoured\nclass of statements could not be picked out in the right way without\nan appeal to relevant experience. So a criterion for membership of the\nfavored class of statements that required only those statements\naccepted by the scientists of the time to be members of the class was\nnot going to be successful without knowing which sentences were thus\naccepted, and this, Ayer claimed, could only be known by\nexperience. The alternative of using yet another sentence, one stating\nthat these (p,q,r, \u2026) were the\nsentences in the relevant class (those accepted by the scientists),\nwould make the foundations of science entirely arbitrary.\n\n\nEven on Ayer\u2019s later view, called \u2018sophisticated\nrealism\u2019(in Ayer 1973), where our perception of physical objects\nwas indirect, the ultimate bases for perceptual judgments were\nsense-data, which were now called \u2018qualia\u2019 (or, if\nparticularized, \u2018percepts\u2019). It was this continuing\ncommitment to sense-data as the objects of perception that drew J.L.\nAustin\u2019s (often sarcastic) criticism in Sense and Sensibilia\n(1962). On Ayer\u2019s view, qualia formed the patterns constituting a primary\nsystem, and it was on the basis of this system that we posited the\nexistence of physical objects, this being the\n\u2018theoretical\u2019 secondary system. Once we have this theory,\nwe are able reinterpret the quale as mental states and claim that they\nare caused by the physical objects. This causal claim is only merited\nonce the theoretical system is in place, and so cannot be a primitive\nelement in any account of perception. The physical objects are\nrequired to be there before any causal hypothesis involving them makes\nsense.\n\n\nPart, but only a part, of Ayer\u2019s reason for embracing such indirect\nrealism was what has been called the argument from illusion, the\ncentral idea of which is that, for any perceptual state of ours, we\ncould be in a state indiscriminable from it but which did not involve\nperception of any material object or scene, it being an illusion that\nthere was any such object or scene to be perceived. That is,\nnon-veridical perceptions could share their intrinsic properties with\nveridical perceptions, this possibility leading Ayer to claim that it\nwas plausible that the object of perception in both cases was\n(non-material) experience, and not, as na\u00efve realism would have\nit, the physical objects themselves. As a consequence, ordinary\nperceptual judgments, those making claims about such objects, go\nbeyond what is \u2018strictly available\u2019 in our perceptual\nexperience, and so they form a theory about that which is available to\nperception.\n\n\nThere are many ways of querying Ayer\u2019s conclusion. Austin attacked the\nway he saw the argument from illusion being deployed. He questioned\njust about everything in it: the distinction between veridical and\nnon-veridical perception, the supposed generalization from \u2018some\n(real) perceptual experience is indiscriminable from a (mere)\nperceptual appearance\u2019 to \u2018all such perceptions are\nindiscriminable from their counterpart appearances\u2019, and the\nassumption that when we have defective perceptions there are\nnon-material objects of those perceptions, sense-data.\n\n\nStrawson (1979) argued that the primary system, that purporting to\ndescribe no more than what was \u2018strictly available\u2019 to\nperception, could only be described using concepts available to those\nalready acquainted with the secondary system. A consequence of this,\nhe claimed, was that the secondary system embodied in ordinary\nperceptual judgments could not be a theory with respect to which the\nprimary system was the data \u2013 the data have to be describable in\nterms that do not presuppose the very theory for which they are the\ndata.  Although, he argued, it may be possible, though difficult, for\nus to strip our vocabulary describing our experience of such\nsecondary-system concepts, such an effort on our part would be\nunusual, and not at all like what is involved in our common-sense\nperceptual judgments, those that Ayer supposes to be the result of\nsome theorizing on our part. For Strawson, our commitment to a\nconceptual scheme of a realist character is \u2018something given\nwith the given\u2019 (Strawson 1979, p. 47).\n\n\nAyer was unmoved by the objections. He replied to Austin\u2019s attack in\n\u201cHas Austin Refuted Sense-data Theory\u201d (Ayer 1967), with\nAyer defending the viability of the distinction between veridical and\nnon-veridical perception, and maintaining that the argument from\nillusion was only one source of the case for sense-data.  (For an\nin-depth discussion of the dispute between Austin and Ayer, see Mike\nThau, \u201cWhat is Disjunctivism\u201d 2004). Against Strawson\n(\u201cReplies\u201d 1979) he noted that there was considerable\nagreement between them: in particular, they both agreed that\nperceptual judgments contain implications going beyond those carried\nby a \u2018strict\u2019 account of our sensible experience. The\ndisagreement was primarily about whether the perceptual judgments were\nbased on, or were inferred from, awareness of sense-data. Ayer\nconceded that such an inference would be only implicit. The point\nabout language he conceded as well, maintaining only that the\nassumptions often built into concepts descriptive of physical objects\n\u2013 the accessibility of such objects to other observers, that\nthey continued to exist unperceived, and so on, would not be in play\nwhen these concepts were used to provide the \u2018strict\u2019\naccount of perceptual experience.\n",
