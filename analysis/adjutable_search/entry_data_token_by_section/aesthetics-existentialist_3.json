    "main_text": "Art as expression of human freedom\n4. Art as expression of human freedom\n\n\nThe metaphysical and ethical dimensions of human freedom are\nintimately related. This is the most significant difference between the\nexistentialists and Husserlian phenomenology: the existentialists link\nthe power to disclose the world to the necessity of human beings to\ndecide who they should be, in terms of the fundamental values directing\na person\u2019s life. The concept of \u201cexistence\u201d\ndesignates precisely this ethical dimension of human life. The\nexistentialists argue that, of all the beings existing in the world,\nthe human being is the only one that can decide what it should be;\nindeed, it is forced to do so since it has no fixed nature. As the\nexistentialist motto goes, \u201cman is condemned to be free.\u201d\nHere, freedom is not just independence in the sense of independence\nfrom, but in the sense of being able to decide who and what\none should be. This ethical dimension of freedom as the power of\nself-determination (which also entails the duty to use it) explains the\ncentral place of the notion of \u201c engagement (commitment).\u201d Before it\ndesignates any necessity to choose in particular situations,\n\u201cengagement\u201d refers to the fundamental position of the\nhuman individual, whose very being consists in having to make use of\nits freedom. On the existentialists\u2019 outlook, the only positive\nfeature of \u201chuman reality,\u201d strictly speaking, is\nresponsibility towards others and towards oneself (and, for the\nChristian existentialists, towards God). Many human beings refuse\nthis burden and flee from their ontological responsibility by accepting\npre-given roles. This is what Sartre\u2019s \u201cbad faith\u201d\nand Marcel\u2019s \u201cfunctional man\u201d designate.\n\n\nWhat is the link between the metaphysical and the ethical dimensions\nof human freedom, and how does this latter concern aesthetics?\n\n\nLet us begin with the first part of the question. We will first\napproach it by using a mode of argument typical of phenomenology. Many\nexistentialists insist that the ways in which a human consciousness\n\u201cintends\u201d the world (that is, imposes a certain order and\nregularity in external phenomena) is intrinsically dependent on the\nvalues the person has set for herself. A mountain climber views a\nmountain in a way radically different from an intellectual who has\ndevoted his or her life to books. The difference in their perspectives\nrelates to the deep projects of selves that distinguish these two\npersons. In other words, behind every perception there is a value\ninfluencing the perception in advance and thus ultimately determining\nits precise content. On a deeper, ontological level, the experience\nthat there is something at all, the experience of being, cannot be\nconceived if there is not a desire for it (an \u201contological\nexigency\u201d says Marcel). The very capacity of human beings to\nconceive something in the world at all is premised on their capacity to\nposit values (Sartre 1943a; Marcel 1960a, for the religious\nperspective).\n\n\nIf that is true, however, then every \u201crevelation\u201d of the\nworld in the first, metaphysical sense also entails a revelation of the\nfundamental ethical (or, as the existentialists preferred, existential)\nproject underpinning this perception. This answers, then, the second\npart of the question regarding the relation between the work of art and\nthe ethical aspect of freedom. For the existentialists, as we saw, the\nwork of art brings to a higher level of reflexivity and consistency the\ninnate capacity of human beings to disclose the world. However, since\nthis capacity is itself rooted in the ethical or religious nature of\nhuman beings, the work of art plays a central role in conveying a more\nacute sense of ethical responsibility. It follows that there is an\nintimate link between art and engagement: every aesthetic ordering of\nthe world brings with it a conception of human freedom and suggests\nways to use it.\n\n\nHence, Sartre\u2019s definition of the literary work, which applies\nbroadly to all works of art: \u201c\u2026 an imaginary presentation\nof the world inasmuch as it requires human freedom\u201d (1948a, 45).\nIn other words, the artwork serves the purpose of \u201cmaking us feel\nessential in relation to the world.\u201d The work of art presents the\nworld not just in the sense that it reveals aspects of it, but also in\nthe sense that it calls for human involvement, notably in collective\naction (or, for Marcel, \u2018communion\u2019) (Goldthorpe 1992).\n\n\nThis definition of the artwork remains ambiguous inasmuch as it does\nnot specify whose freedom is required. A number of features can be\ndelineated as a result, depending on whose freedom is emphasised in\neach case.\n\n\nThe freedom required by the world is first of all that of the\nartist. Every artwork reveals a fundamental, existential attitude\ntowards the world, and is the expression of an existential choice. We\nwill return to the fundamental notion of expression below, but we can\nalready note that putting existential weight on every act of disclosure\nleads directly to the conclusion that artistic practice is intimately\nlinked to ethical and political choices.\n\n\nHowever, the \u2018expressive\u2019 aspect of the artwork, the\nfact that it is the manifestation of a unique subjectivity, is not the\nmost interesting one for the existentialists; from this perspective,\nexistentialist aesthetics is quite distant from romanticism. This is\nbecause existence, freedom and self-determination are, for the\nexistentialists, essentially active and practical notions. The\nexistential choice is not simply a choice of who one should\nbe, in the sense of a choice of personality or character; the theory of\nexistence does not translate into a theory of genius. Rather, the\nemphasis is on the active relationship within the world, and especially\nwith others. Accordingly, one defines who one is by what one\ndoes with one\u2019s freedom in the world, through the ways\nin which one proposes to change the world, notably in relation to other\nhuman agents. When the artist presents the world, whether he or she\nlikes it or not this presentation also proposes to others ways to\nlive in the world and possibly (at least for the most politically\nminded authors, such as Sartre, de Beauvoir and Merleau-Ponty) ways to\nchange it. In Sartre\u2019s words, every \u201cimaginary presentation\nof the world\u201d is an act of \u201ca\u201d freedom speaking to\n\u201cother\u201d freedoms about possible ways of engaging freedom in\nthe world. Extending Sartre\u2019s definition of the novel, then, we\ncould say that every artwork is an \u201cappeal\u201d (Sartre 1948a,\n32).\n\n\nTherefore the artwork involves a freedom that is not just that of\nthe artist, but also that of the audience. In existentialist language,\nit is freedom considered as \u2018engaged,\u2019 that is, irreducibly\ncaught up in engagement and forced to do something about it. Hence,\nSartre offers another definition of the artwork that identifies the\ndifferent poles of the metaphysical power of art: \u201c\u2026 the\nwriter has chosen to reveal the world and particularly to reveal man to\nother men so that the latter may assume full responsibility before the\nobject which has thus been laid bare\u201d (Sartre 1948a, 14).\n\n\nIn their own artistic practice and their work as critics, the\nexistentialists tended to interpret this conception of art\u2019s\nmission (as revelation and appeal) as an argument in favour of\nrepresentational approaches, and against formalistic and puristic\napproaches. They were generally sceptical of \u2018autotelic\u2019\nconceptions of the artwork that view it as a self-contained object\nanswerable only to its own formal rules. In this respect, again, they\ndiffer from some modernist views. Indeed, this insistence on the\nrepresentative dimension of art might appear old-fashioned, inasmuch as\nthe more modern insistence on the autonomy of the artwork has marked\nmost late 19th century aesthetic projects and their\n20th century descendants. The existentialists\u2019\ninsistence on the intrinsic ethical and political significance of the\nartwork further distances them from these other aesthetic\napproaches.\n",
