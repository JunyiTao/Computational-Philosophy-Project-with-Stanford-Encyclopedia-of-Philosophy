    "main_text": "Eight Ways of Dealing with the Repugnant Conclusion || Appeal to other values\n2.6 Appeal to other values\n\nFred Feldman has proposed a desert-adjusted version of utilitarianism,\n\u2018justicism\u2019 which he claims avoids the Repugnant\nConclusion (Feldman 1997). In justicism, the value of an episode of\npleasure is determined not only by the hedonic level but also by the\nrecipient\u2019s desert level. Feldman\u2019s proposal is that there\nis some level of happiness that people deserve merely in virtue of\nbeing people. He assumes that this level corresponds to 100 units of\npleasure and that people with very low welfare enjoy only one unit of\npleasure. He suggests that the life of a person who deserves 100 units\nof pleasure and receives exactly that amount of pleasure has an\nintrinsic value of 200, whereas the life of a person deserving 100\nunits but who only receives one unit of pleasure has an intrinsic\nvalue of \u221249. It follows that any population consisting of\npeople with very low welfare and desert level 100 has negative value,\nwhereas any population with very high welfare has positive value.\nConsequently, it seems as if justicism avoids the Repugnant\nConclusion. Moreover, the intuition behind Feldman\u2019s explanation\nof the unacceptability of the Repugnant Conclusion\u2014that there is\nsome level of welfare that people deserve merely in virtue of being\npeople\u2014is compelling and probably widely shared and could give\nsupport to ideas such as the critical level view discussed above.\n\nIt has been pointed out, however, that Feldman\u2019s reasoning\ninvolves a questionable interpretation of the ceteris paribus\nclause in the repugnant conclusion (Arrhenius 2003). He implicitly\nassumes that the ceteris paribus clause is satisfied whenever\nthe people in the compared populations have the same desert level. A\nmore plausible reading of the ceteris paribus clause is that\nit is satisfied if and only if the compared populations are (roughly)\nequally good in regard to all other axiologically relevant aspects\napart from welfare, including their \u201cdesert value\u201d. Hence,\nto satisfy the ceteris paribus clause, the compared\npopulations should be equally good in regard to desert, that is,\nequally good in regard to the contributive value of the fit between\nwhat people deserve and what they get. Given this interpretation of\nthe ceteris paribus clause, justicism does imply the\nrepugnant conclusion. If A and Z are equally good in\nregard to desert, then justicism ranks Z as better than\nA since Z has greater total well-being.\n\nOne might also try to solve the Mere Addition Paradox by an appeal to\negalitarian considerations. Consider population A and A+\nin figure 2 again. According to a well-known principle, Maximin, we\nshould rank populations according to the welfare of the worst off: The\nlower the welfare of the worst off, the worse the population. Maximin\nranks A+ as worse than A and thus stops the Mere\nAddition Paradox in its first step. However, Maximin has a number of\nother counterintuitive implications in population ethics since it\nimposes a kind of dictatorship of the worst off according to which the\nslightest gain in welfare for one of the worst of person outweighs a\nvery large loss for any number of better off people.\n\nStill, A+ is clearly more unequal than A, and it\nisn\u2019t unreasonable to claim that A+ is in this respect\nworse than A. For example, according to Temkin (1993a, p. 200),\n\u201cthe ultimate intuition underlying egalitarianism is that it is\nbad \u2026 for some to be worse off than others through no fault of\ntheir own\u201d. Clearly, this is the case in A+ since the\nextra people have not done anything to deserve to be worse off than\nthe better off people. Moreover, as suggested by Temkin, one might\nhold the view that the greater the number of worst off, the worse the\ninequality. (Temkin 1993a, p. 200\u20132). Consequently, since the\nnumber of worse off extra people in the Mere Addition Paradox has to\nbe enormous to reach the Z population (see figure 1) by\nredistribution of welfare, the inequality involved would be\nconsiderable. Hence, there seems to be a prima facie case that\negalitarian concerns can solve the Mere Addition Paradox. \n\nThe crucial question, however, is whether inequality makes A+\nworse than A all things considered. Since A+ is clearly\nbetter than A in respect to total welfare, the pluralist\negalitarian has to limit the importance of total welfare relative to\nthe importance of inequality to reach this judgement. There are some\npromising ways the pluralist egalitarian could do this albeit it is as\nyet unclear whether these proposals will stand up to further scrutiny.\nMore problematic for the egalitarian approach, however, is that the\nRepugnant Conclusion can be derived from conditions to which an\negalitarian has no decisive objections (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2008;\nArrhenius 2009b). \n",
