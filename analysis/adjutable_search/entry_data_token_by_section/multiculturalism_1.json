    "main_text": "Justifications for multiculturalism || Recognition\n2.1 Recognition\n\nOne justification for multiculturalism arises out of the communitarian\ncritique of liberalism. Liberals tend to be ethical individualists;\nthey insist that individuals should be free to choose and pursue their\nown conceptions of the good life. They give primacy to individual\nrights and liberties over community life and collective goods. Some\nliberals are also individualists when it comes to social ontology\n(what some call methodological individualism or atomism).\nMethodological individualists believe that you can and should account\nfor social actions and social goods in terms of the properties of the\nconstituent individuals and individual goods. The target of the\ncommunitarian critique of liberalism is not so much liberal ethics as\nliberal social ontology. Communitarians reject the idea that the\nindividual is prior to the community and that the value of social\ngoods can be reduced to their contribution to individual well-being.\nThey instead embrace ontological holism, which acknowledges collective\ngoods as, in Charles Taylor\u2019s words, \u201cirreducibly\nsocial\u201dand intrinsically valuable (Taylor 1995).\n\nAn ontologically holist view of collective identities and cultures\nunderlies Taylor\u2019s argument for a \u201cpolitics of\nrecognition.\u201d Drawing on Rousseau, Herder, and Hegel, among\nothers, Taylor argues that we do not become full human agents and\ndefine our identity in isolation from others; rather, \u201cwe define\nour identity always in dialogue with, sometimes in struggle against,\nthe things our significant others want to see in us\u201d (1994, 33).\nBecause our identities are formed dialogically, we are dependent on\nthe recognition of others. The absence of recognition or\nmis-recognition can cause serious injury: \u201cA person or a group\nof people can suffer real damage, real distortion, if the people or\nsociety around them mirror back to them a confining or demeaning or\ncontemptible picture of themselves\u201d (25). The struggle for\nrecognition can only be satisfactorily resolved through \u201ca\nregime of reciprocal recognition among equals\u201d (50). Taylor\ndistinguishes the politics of recognition from the traditional liberal\n\u201cpolitics of equal respect\u201d that is \u201cinhospitable to\ndifference, because (a) it insists on uniform application of the rules\ndefining these rights, without exception, and (b) it is suspicious of\ncollective goals\u201d (60). By contrast, the politics of recognition\nis grounded on \u201cjudgments about what makes a good\nlife\u2014judgments in which the integrity of cultures has an\nimportant place\u201d (61). He discusses the example of the survival\nof French culture in Quebec. The French language is not merely a\ncollective resource that individuals might want to make use of and\nthereby seek to preserve, as suggested by a politics of equal respect.\nInstead, the French language is an irreducibly collective good that\nitself deserves to be preserved: language policies aimed at preserving\nthe French language in Qu\u00e9bec \u201cactively seek to create\nmembers of the community\u201d by assuring that future generations\ncontinue to identify as French-speakers (58). Because of the\nindispensable role of cultures in the development human agency and\nidentity, Taylor argues, we should adopt the presumption of the equal\nworth of all cultures (66). \n",
