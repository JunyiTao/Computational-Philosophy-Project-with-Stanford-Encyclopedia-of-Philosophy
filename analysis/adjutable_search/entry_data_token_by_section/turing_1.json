    "main_text": "The Turing Machine and Computability\n2. The Turing Machine and Computability\n\n\nAlan Turing drew much between 1928 and 1933 from the work of the\nmathematical physicist and populariser A. S. Eddington, from J. von\nNeumann's account of the foundations of quantum mechanics, and then\nfrom Bertrand Russell's mathematical logic. Meanwhile, his lasting\nfascination with the problems of mind and matter was heightened by\nemotional elements in his own life (Hodges 1983, p. 63). In 1934 he\ngraduated with an outstanding degree in mathematics from Cambridge\nUniversity, followed by a successful dissertation in probability theory\nwhich won him a Fellowship of King's College, Cambridge, in 1935. This\nwas the background to his learning, also in 1935, of the problem which\nwas to make his name. \n\n\nIt was from the lectures of the topologist M. H. A. (Max) Newman in\nthat year that he learnt of G\u00f6del's 1931 proof of the formal\nincompleteness of logical systems rich enough to include arithmetic,\nand of the outstanding problem in the foundations of mathematics as\nposed by Hilbert: the \u201cEntscheidungsproblem\u201d (decision problem). Was\nthere a method by which it could be decided, for any given mathematical\nproposition, whether or not it was provable?\n\n\nThe principal difficulty of this question lay in giving an\nunassailably correct and general definition of what was meant by such\nexpressions as \u2018definite method\u2019 or \u2018effective\nprocedure.\u2019 Turing worked on this alone for a year until April\n1936; independence and isolation was to be both his strength, in\nformulating original ideas, and his weakness, when it came to promoting\nand implementing them.\n\n\nThe word \u2018mechanical\u2019 had often been used of the\nformalist approach lying behind Hilbert's problem, and Turing seized on\nthe concept of the machine.Turing's solution lay in defining\nwhat was soon to be named the Turing machine. With this he\ndefined the concept of \u2018the mechanical\u2019 in terms of simple\natomic operations. The Turing machine formalism was modelled on the\nteleprinter, slightly enlarged in scope to allow a paper tape that\ncould move in both directions and a \u2018head\u2019 that could read,\nerase and print new symbols, rather than only read and punch permanent\nholes.\n\n\nThe Turing machine is \u2018theoretical,\u2019 in the sense that\nit is not intended actually to be engineered (there being no point in\ndoing so), although it is essential that its atomic components (the\npaper tape, movement to left and right, testing for the presence of a\nsymbol) are such as could actually be implemented. The whole\npoint of the formalism is to reduce the concept of \u2018method\u2019\nto simple operations that can unquestionably be\n\u2018effected.\u2019\n\n\nNevertheless Turing's purpose was to embody the most general\nmechanical process as carried out by a human being. His\nanalysis began not with any existing computing machines, but with the\npicture of a child's exercise book marked off in squares. From the\nbeginning, the Turing machine concept aimed to capture what the\nhuman mind can do when carrying out a procedure.\n\n\nIn speaking of \u2018the\u2019 Turing machine it should be made\nclear that there are infinitely many Turing machines, each\ncorresponding to a different method or procedure, by virtue of having a\ndifferent \u2018table of behaviour.\u2019 Nowadays it is almost\nimpossible to avoid imagery which did not exist in 1936: that of the\ncomputer. In modern terms, the \u2018table of behaviour\u2019 of a\nTuring machine is equivalent to a computer program.\n\n\nIf a Turing machine corresponds to a computer program, what is the\nanalogy of the computer? It is what Turing described as a\nuniversal machine (Turing 1936, p. 241). Again, there are\ninfinitely many universal Turing machines, forming a subset of\nTuring machines; they are those machines with \u2018tables of\nbehaviour\u2019 complex enough to read the tables of other Turing\nmachines, and then do what those machines would have done. If this\nseems strange, note the modern parallel that any computer can be\nsimulated by software on another computer. The way that tables can read\nand simulate the effect of other tables is crucial to Turing's theory,\ngoing far beyond Babbage's ideas of a hundred years earlier. It also\nshows why Turing's ideas go to the heart of the modern computer, in\nwhich it is essential that programs are themselves a form of data which\ncan be manipulated by other programs. But the reader must always\nremember that in 1936 there were no such computers; indeed the modern\ncomputer arose out of the formulation of \u2018behaving\nmechanically\u2019 that Turing found in this work.\n\n\nTuring's machine formulation allowed the precise definition of the\ncomputable: namely, as what can be done by a Turing machine\nacting alone. More exactly, computable operations are those which can\nbe effected by what Turing called automatic machines. The\ncrucial point here is that the action of an automatic Turing machine is\ntotally determined by its \u2018table of behaviour\u2019. (Turing\nalso allowed for \u2018choice machines\u2019 which call for human\ninputs, rather than being totally determined.) Turing then proposed\nthat this definition of \u2018computable\u2019 captured precisely\nwhat was intended by such words as \u2018definite method, procedure,\nmechanical process\u2019 in stating the\nEntscheidungsproblem.\n\n\nIn applying his machine concept to the\nEntscheidungsproblem, Turing took the step of defining\ncomputable numbers. These are those real numbers, considered\nas infinite decimals, say, which it is possible for a Turing machine,\nstarting with an empty tape, to print out. For example, the Turing\nmachine which simply prints the digit 1 and moves to the right, then\nrepeats that action for ever, can thereby compute the number\n.1111111\u2026 A more complicated Turing machine can compute the\ninfinite decimal expansion of \u03c0.\n\n\nTuring machines, like computer programs, are countable; indeed they\ncan be ordered in a complete list by a kind of alphabetical ordering of\ntheir \u2018tables of behaviour\u2019. Turing did this by encoding\nthe tables into \u2018description numbers\u2019 which can then be\nordered in magnitude. Amongst this list, a subset of them (those with\n\u2018satisfactory\u2019 description numbers) are the machines which\nhave the effect of printing out infinite decimals. It is readily shown,\nusing a \u2018diagonal\u2019 argument first used by Cantor and\nfamiliar from the discoveries of Russell and G\u00f6del, that there can\nbe no Turing machine with the property of deciding whether a\ndescription number is satisfactory or not. The argument can be\npresented as follows. Suppose that such a Turing machine exists. Then\nit is possible to construct a new Turing machine which works out in\nturn the Nth digit from the Nth machine possessing a satisfactory\ndescription number. This new machine then prints an Nth digit differing\nfrom that digit. As the machine proceeds, it prints out an infinite\ndecimal, and therefore has a \u2018satisfactory\u2019 description\nnumber. Yet this number must by construction differ from the outputs of\nevery Turing machine with a satisfactory description number. This is a\ncontradiction, so the hypothesis must be false (Turing 1936, p. 246).\nFrom this, Turing was able to answer Hilbert's\nEntscheidungsproblem in the negative: there can be no such\ngeneral method.\n\n\nTuring's proof can be recast in many ways, but the core idea depends\non the self-reference involved in a machine operating on\nsymbols, which is itself described by symbols and so can operate on its\nown description. Indeed, the self-referential aspect of the theory can\nbe highlighted by a different form of the proof, which Turing preferred\n(Turing 1936, p. 247). Suppose that such a machine for deciding\nsatisfactoriness does exist; then apply it to its own description\nnumber. A contradiction can readily be obtained. However, the\n\u2018diagonal\u2019 method has the advantage of bringing out the\nfollowing: that a real number may be defined unambiguously,\nyet be uncomputable. It is a non-trivial discovery that\nwhereas some infinite decimals (e.g. \u03c0) may be encapsulated in a\nfinite table, other infinite decimals (in fact, almost all) cannot.\nLikewise there are decision problems such as \u2018is this number\nprime?\u2019 in which infinitely many answers are wrapped up in a\nfinite recipe, while there are others (again, almost all) which are\nnot, and must be regarded as requiring infinitely many different\nmethods. \u2018Is this a provable proposition?\u2019 belongs to the\nlatter category.\n\n\nThis is what Turing established, and into the bargain the remarkable\nfact that anything that is computable can in fact be computed\nby one machine, a universal Turing machine.\n\n\nIt was vital to Turing's work that he justified the definition by\nshowing that it encompassed the most general idea of\n\u2018method\u2019. For if it did not, the\nEntscheidungproblem remained open: there might be some more\npowerful type of method than was encompassed by Turing computability.\nOne justification lay in showing that the definition included many\nprocesses a mathematician would consider to be natural in computation\n(Turing 1936, p. 254). Another argument involved a human calculator\nfollowing written instruction notes. (Turing 1936, p. 253). But in a\nbolder argument, the one he placed first, he considered an\n\u2018intuitive\u2019 argument appealing to the states of\nmind of a human computer. (Turing 1936, p. 249). The entry of\n\u2018mind\u2019 into his argument was highly significant, but at\nthis stage it was only a mind following a rule.\n\n\nTo summarise: Turing found, and justified on very general and\nfar-reaching grounds, a precise mathematical formulation of the\nconception of a general process or method. His work, as presented to\nNewman in April 1936, argued that his formulation of\n\u2018computability\u2019 encompassed \u2018the possible processes\nwhich can be carried out in computing a number.\u2019 (Turing 1936,\np. 232). This opened up new fields of discovery both in practical\ncomputation, and in the discussion of human mental processes. However,\nalthough Turing had worked as what Newman called \u2018a confirmed\nsolitary\u2019 (Hodges 1983, p 113), he soon learned that he was not\nalone in what Gandy (1988) has called \u2018the confluence of ideas in\n1936.\u2019\n\n\nThe Princeton logician Alonzo Church had slightly outpaced Turing in\nfinding a satisfactory definition of what he called \u2018effective\ncalculability.\u2019 Church's definition required the logical\nformalism of the lambda-calculus. This meant that from the\noutset Turing's achievement merged with and superseded the formulation\nof Church's Thesis, namely the assertion that the\nlambda-calculus formalism correctly embodied the concept of effective\nprocess or method. Very rapidly it was shown that the mathematical\nscope of Turing computability coincided with Church's definition (and\nalso with the scope of the general recursive functions defined\nby G\u00f6del). Turing wrote his own statement (Turing 1939, p. 166) of\nthe conclusions that had been reached in 1938; it is in the Ph.D.\nthesis that he wrote under Church's supervision, and so this statement\nis the nearest we have to a joint statement of the \u2018Church-Turing\nthesis\u2019:\nA function is said to be \u2018effectively\ncalculable\u2019 if its values can be found by some purely mechanical\nprocess. Although it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this\nidea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite,\nmathematically expressible definition. Such a definition was first\ngiven by G\u00f6del at Princeton in 1934\u2026 These functions were\ndescribed as \u2018general recursive\u2019 by G\u00f6del\u2026\nAnother definition of effective calculability has been given by\nChurch\u2026 who identifies it with lambda-definability. The author\n[i.e. Turing] has recently suggested a definition corresponding more\nclosely to the intuitive idea\u2026 It was stated above that \u2018a\nfunction is effectively calculable if its values can be found by a\npurely mechanical process.\u2019 We may take this statement literally,\nunderstanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried\nout by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in\na certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The\ndevelopment of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a\ncomputable function, and to an identification of computability with\neffective calculability. It is not difficult, though somewhat\nlaborious, to prove that these three definitions are\nequivalent.\n\n\nChurch accepted that Turing's definition gave a compelling, intuitive\nreason for why Church's thesis was true. The recent exposition by\nDavis (2000) emphasises that G\u00f6del also was convinced by Turing's\nargument that an absolute concept had been identified (G\u00f6del\n1946). The situation has not changed since 1937.  (For further\ncomment, see the article on the\n Church-Turing Thesis. \nThe recent selection of Turing's papers edited by Copeland (2004),\nand the review of Hodges (2006), continue this discussion.)\n\n\nTuring himself did little to evangelise his formulation in the world\nof mathematical logic and early computer science. The textbooks of\nDavis (1958) and Minsky (1967) did more. Nowadays Turing computability\nis often reformulated (e.g. in terms of \u2018register\nmachines\u2019). However, computer simulations (e.g.,\n Turing's World,\n from Stanford) have brought Turing's\noriginal imagery to life.\n\n\nTuring's work also opened new areas for decidability questions\nwithin pure mathematics. From the 1970s, Turing machines also took on\nnew life in the development of complexity theory, and as such\nunderpin one of the most important research areas in computer science.\nThis development exemplifies the lasting value of Turing's special\nquality of giving concrete illustration to abstract concepts.\n",
