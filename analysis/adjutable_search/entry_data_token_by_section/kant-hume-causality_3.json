    "main_text": "Kant, Hume, and the Newtonian Science of Nature\n4. Time Determination, the Analogies of Experience, and the Unity of Nature\n\nWe have suggested that Kant\u2019s reconstruction of Newton\u2019s\n\u201cdeduction from the phenomena\u201d of the law of universal\ngravitation in the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural\nScience is inextricably entangled with his reinterpretation of\nthe Newtonian concepts of (absolute) space, time, and\n motion.[40]\n Indeed, Kant begins the Metaphysical Foundations by defining\nmatter as \u201cthe movable in space\u201d\u2014and by introducing\na distinction between absolute and relative space which is clearly\nderived from Newton\u2019s Scholium on space, time, and motion at the\nbeginning of the Principia (see\n note 38\n above). In Newton\u2019s words (Principia, 408\u2013409):\n\n\n\nAbsolute space, of its own nature without reference to anything\nexternal, always remains homogeneous and immovable. Relative space is\nany movable measure or dimension of this absolute space. \n\n\nIn Kant\u2019s words (4, 480; 15): \n\n\nMatter is the movable in space. That space which is\nitself movable is called material, or also relative space.\nThat space in which all motion must finally be thought (and\nwhich is therefore itself absolutely immovable) is called pure, or\nalso absolute space.\n\n\nIt turns out, however, that Kant\u2019s own view, in apparent\ncontrast with Newton\u2019s, is that \u201cabsolute space is in\nitself nothing and no object at all\u201d, but signifies only an\nindefinite process of considering ever more extended relative spaces\n(4, 481\u2013482; 16\u201317). Moreover, when Kant returns to this\nissue in the Phenomenology chapter (compare\n note 36\n above), he states that \n\n\nabsolute space is therefore not necessary as the concept of an actual\nobject, but only as an idea, which is to serve as the rule for\nconsidering all motion and rest therein merely as relative. (4, 560;\n99) \n\n\nKant\u2019s procedure for deriving \u201ctrue motions\u201d from\n\u201capparent motions\u201d does not conceive true motions as\ntaking place in a pre-given absolute space, but views them as the\nproduct of an indefinitely extended process of empirical determination\ntaking place within experience itself: we begin from our parochial\nperspective here on the surface of the earth, proceed (in accordance\nwith the argument of Book 3 of Newton\u2019s Principia) to\nthe center of gravity of the solar system, then proceed to the center\nof gravity of the Milky Way galaxy, and so on ad\n infinitum.[41]\n\nSimilarly, it is a central theme of the Analogies of Experience in the\nfirst Critique that \u201cabsolute\ntime\u201d\u2014\u201ctime itself\u201d (B219), \u201ctime for\nitself\u201d (B225), or \u201ctime in itself\u201d (B233)\u2014is\nno actual object of perception. Hence, the three \u201cmodes of\ntime\u201d (duration, succession, and simultaneity) must all be\ndetermined in and through perceptible features of the appearances.\nKant calls this procedure \u201ctime determination\u201d (more\nprecisely, \u201cthe determination of the existence of appearances in\ntime\u201d), and he sums up his view as follows (A215/B262):\n\n\nThese, then, are the three analogies of experience. They are nothing\nelse but the principles for the determination of the existence of\nappearances in time with respect to all of its three modes, the\nrelation to time itself as a magnitude (the magnitude of existence,\ni.e., duration), the relation in time as a series (successively), and\nfinally [the relation] in time as a totality of all existence\n(simultaneously). This unity of time determination is thoroughly\ndynamical; that is, time is not viewed as that in which experience\nimmediately determines the place of an existent, which is impossible,\nbecause absolute time is no object of perception by means of which\nappearances could be bound together; rather, the rule of the\nunderstanding, by means of which alone the existence of the\nappearances can acquire synthetic unity with respect to temporal\nrelations, determines for each [appearance] its position in time, and\nthus [determines this] a priori and valid for each and every time.\n\n\nFor Kant, therefore, the temporal relations of duration, succession,\nand simultaneity cannot be viewed as pre-existing, as it were, in an\nabsolute time subsisting prior to and independently of the procedures\nof our pure understanding for determining these relations within the\nappearances themselves. On the contrary, temporal relations as such\nare the products of an empirical construction whereby we objectively\ndetermine the appearances as objects of a unified experience by means\nof the a priori principles of the Analogies. Thus, just as Kant does\nnot view the determination of true motions from apparent motions as\ntaking place within an infinite empty absolute space, he also rejects\nan analogous conception of absolute time and replaces it, too, with a\nprocess of empirical determination taking place within experience\nitself.\n\nIndeed, there is an intimate relationship between these two procedures\nfor empirical determination\u2014of time and of motion, respectively.\nAt the very beginning of his famous Scholium Newton distinguishes\nbetween \u201ctrue\u201d and merely \u201capparent\u201d time\n(Principia, 408): \n\n\nAbsolute, true, and mathematical time, in and of itself and of its own\nnature, without reference to anything external, flows uniformly and by\nanother name is called duration. Relative, apparent, and common time\nis any sensible measure (whether accurate or nonuniform) of duration\nby means of motion: such a measure\u2014for example, an hour, a day,\na month, a year\u2014is commonly used instead of true time. \n\n\nThen, several pages later, Newton illustrates the difference between\n\u201cabsolute\u201d and \u201crelative\u201d time with reference\nto the celestial motions studied in astronomy (Principia,\n410):\n\n\nIn astronomy, absolute time is distinguished from relative time by the\nequation of common time. For natural days, which are commonly\nconsidered equal for the purpose of measuring time, are actually\nunequal. Astronomers correct this inequality in order to measure\ncelestial motions on the basis of a truer time. It is possible that\nthere is no uniform motion by which time may have an accurate measure.\nAll motions can be accelerated and retarded, but the flow of absolute\ntime cannot be changed. The duration or perseverance of the existence\nof things is the same, whether their motions are rapid or slow or\nnull; accordingly, duration is rightly distinguished from its sensible\nmeasures and is gathered from them by means of an astronomical\nequation.\n\n\nNewton is here referring to the standard astronomical procedure,\nalready well-understood in ancient astronomy, whereby we correct the\nordinary measure of time in terms of days, months, and years so as to\nobtain \u201csidereal\u201d or mean solar time based on the motions\nof the sun relative to both the earth and the fixed\n stars.[42]\n\nIn the Refutation of Idealism added to the second edition of the\nCritique Kant argues that all empirical determination of\ntime\u2014including determination of the temporal relations among\none\u2019s own inner states\u2014ultimately depends on the\nperception of outer things, and, in particular, on the perception of\nmotion in space (B277\u2013278):\n\n\nAll empirical employment of our cognitive faculties in the\ndetermination of time fully agrees with this. It is not only that we\ncan undertake all time determination only by the change of external\nrelations (motion) in relation to the permanent in space (e.g., motion\nof the sun with respect to objects on the earth), but we also have\nnothing at all permanent, which could underlie the concept of a\nsubstance, as intuition, except merely matter, and even this\npermanence is not derived from outer experience, but is rather\npresupposed a priori as necessary condition of all time determination,\nand thus also [of] the determination of inner sense with respect to\nour own existence by means of the existence of outer things.\n\n\nIn emphasizing that only matter can instantiate the concept\nof substance here, Kant is alluding to the way in which the\nconservation of the total quantity of matter, in the Metaphysical\nFoundations, realizes the (transcendental) principle of the\nconservation of\n substance.[43]\n Moreover, Kant\u2019s language at B277\u2013278 (we\n\u201cundertake [vornehmen]\u201d time\ndetermination by observing \u201cmotion of the sun with respect to\nobjects on the earth\u201d) thereby suggests a progressive empirical\nprocedure in which we begin with our perspective here on earth,\nmeasure the duration of time by the apparent motion of the sun, and\nthen proceed to correct this measure in light of our evolving\nastronomical\n knowledge.[44]\n\nFor Kant, once again, this need for correction is not an indication of\na pre-existing absolute time subsisting prior to and independently of\nour empirical procedures for determining temporal magnitudes from\nobservable motions. It rather implies that empirically observable\nmotions must be subject to a priori principles of the understanding (a\npriori rules of time determination) in order to count as fully\nobjective experience within a unified, temporally determinate\nobjective world. Applying the relevant principles of the\nunderstanding\u2014the Analogies of Experience\u2014therefore\nresults in a sequence of successive corrections or refinements of our\nordinary temporal experience, as the observable motions are\nprogressively embedded within an increasingly precise and refined\nconception of temporality itself.\n\nIn the Metaphysical Foundations, in particular, Kant\narticulates a specific realization of the Analogies of Experience in\nterms of the Newtonian theory of universal gravitation. Kant\u2019s\nthree \u201claws of mechanics\u201d (a version of the Newtonian laws\nof motion: compare notes\n 12\n and\n 32\n above) correspond to the three principles of the Analogies; the\ncategories of substance, causality, and community are realized by the\nsystem of Newtonian massive bodies interacting with one another in the\ncontext of what Newton, in Book III of the Principia, calls\nthe System of the World. The category of substance, that is, is\nrealized by the conservation of the total quantity of matter (mass) in\nall interactions involving these bodies (compare\n note 43\n above, together with the sentence to which it is appended); the\ncategory of causality is realized by the gravitational forces through\nwhich these interactions take place (in accordance with the law of\ninertia); and the category of community is realized by the\ncircumstance that precisely these forces are everywhere mutually\nequal and opposite. The temporal relation of duration is thereby\nrealized by the progressive empirical procedure by which we\nsuccessively correct our ordinary measure of time in light of our\nevolving astronomical knowledge (compare\n note 44\n above, together with the sentence to which it is\n appended).[45]\n The temporal relation of succession is realized by the deterministic\nevolution of the motions of the bodies (masses) in question described\nby the law of universal gravitation (according to which every later\nstate of the system is uniquely determined by its earlier\n states).[46]\n The temporal relation of simultaneity, finally, is realized by the\ncircumstance that gravitational forces instantaneously\nconnect each body in the system with all other\n bodies.[47]\n It is in precisely this sense that the procedure of time\ndetermination Kant describes in the Analogies is intended to replace\nthe conception of a pre-given absolute time.\n\nWe have now arrived at the most fundamental divergence between Kant\nand Hume concerning causation and induction. For Hume, the order of\ntime is empirically given by the sequence of impressions and ideas\n(and associations among them) which in fact happen to appear before\nthe mind. As Kant explains in the Second Analogy, however, such a\nsequence, from his point of view, is \n\n\nmerely something subjective, and determines no object, and\ncan therefore in no way count as cognition of any object at all (not\neven in the appearance). (A195/B240) \n\n\nFor Kant, it is only the a priori concept of causality (requiring a\nnecessary rule of connection between preceding and succeeding events)\nwhich can then transform a merely subjective temporal sequence into an\nobjective one (ibid.):\n\n\nIf we thus experience that something happens, then we always\npresuppose thereby that something precedes on which it follows in\naccordance with a rule. For otherwise I would not say of the object\nthat it follows, because the mere sequence in my apprehension, if it\nis not determined by means of a rule in relation to something\npreceding, justifies no sequence in the object. Therefore, it is\nalways in reference to a rule, in accordance with which the\nappearances in their sequence (i.e., as they happen) are determined\nthrough the previous state, that I make my subjective synthesis (of\napprehension) objective, and, it is solely under this presupposition\nthat even the experience of something happening is possible.\n\n\nIt is for precisely this reason, Kant concludes, that mere induction\nalone cannot be the ground for objective causal\nconnections\u2014which presuppose both strict universality and\nnecessity, and therefore must be grounded on a priori concepts and\nprinciples of the pure understanding\n(A195\u2013196/B240\u2013241):\n\n\nIt seems, to be sure, that this contradicts all remarks that have\nalways been made concerning the course of the employment of our\nunderstanding, according to which we have only been first guided by\nthe perception and comparison of many concurring sequences of events\nfollowing on certain appearances to discover a rule, in accordance\nwith which certain events always follow on certain appearances, and we\nhave thereby been first prompted to make for ourselves the concept of\ncause. On such a basis this concept would be merely empirical, and the\nrule it supplies, that everything that happens has a cause, would be\njust as contingent as experience itself: its universality and\nnecessity would then be only feigned and would have no true universal\nvalidity, because they would not be grounded a priori but only on\ninduction.\n\n\nFor Kant, the concept of cause cannot possibly arise from a mere\nrepetition of resembling constant conjunctions (\u201cconcurring\nsequences of events following on certain appearances\u201d) producing\na merely subjective\n custom.[48]\n The procedure by which we apply the concept of cause to experience\ncannot be merely inductive in the Humean sense; it must rather involve\na priori rules of the understanding through which we progressively\ndetermine the objective causal relations between appearances\u2014and\nthereby determine the objective order of succession in time\n itself.[49]\n\nKant thus has a completely different perspective from Hume\u2019s\nconcerning the uniformity of nature. For Hume, the principle of\nuniformity is a supposition implicit in all of our inductive\ninferences leading to the formulation of laws of nature. If this\nprinciple itself had a foundation in the understanding (in either a\npriori or a posteriori \u201creasoning\u201d), then so would our\ninductive inferences from observed constant conjunctions to so far\nunobserved events. Yet the supposition in\nquestion\u2014\u201cthat instances, of which we have had no\nexperience, must resemble those, of which we have had experience, and\nthat the course of nature continues always uniformly the\nsame\u201d (T 1.3.6.4; SBN 89)\u2014cannot itself be justified\nby either demonstrative or inductive reasoning. In the former case it\nwould have to be self-contradictory to imagine that the course of\nnature is not sufficiently uniform; in the latter the attempted\njustification would be viciously circular. The principle of\nuniformity, however, is firmly based in custom or habit, as a\nuniversal principle of the human mind, and it is also the foundation\nfor the Newtonian inductive method\u2014including Hume\u2019s own\ninductive science of the human mind. Although the principle thus has\nnormative force in all our reasoning concerning matters of fact in\nboth science and common life, it cannot ultimately legitimate the\nattribution of objective necessity to our inductively established laws\nof\n nature.[50]\n\nKant, in our view, is attempting to provide precisely such a grounding\nof objective necessity by means of the general principle of the\nAnalogies of Experience (B218): \u201cExperience is possible only by\nmeans of the representation of a necessary connection of\nperceptions\u201d. More specifically, the Analogies of Experience\nprovide an a priori conception of the unity and uniformity of\nexperience playing the role, for Kant, of Hume\u2019s principle of\nthe uniformity of nature. According to the Analogies we know a priori\nthat nature in general must consist of interacting substances in space\nand time governed by universally valid and necessary causal laws\ndetermining the temporal relations (of duration, succession, and\nsimultaneity) among all empirical events, and this articulated a\npriori conception of nature in general amounts to the knowledge that\nnature is, in fact, sufficiently\n uniform.[51]\n\nWe can only have objective experience of particular events, for Kant,\nin so far as we simultaneously construct particular causal relations\namong them step by step, and this is only possible, in turn, in so far\nas we presuppose that they are one and all parts of a unified and\nuniform experience of nature in space and time governed by the\nAnalogies of Experience (together with the other principles of pure\nunderstanding). Moreover, since particular causal relations, for Kant,\nnecessarily involve causal laws, all of our inferences from particular\nperceptions to universal causal laws of nature are grounded in\nsynthetic a priori principles of pure understanding providing a\nsynthetic a priori conception of the unity and uniformity of nature in\ngeneral. Hume was correct, therefore, that the principle of the\nuniformity of nature governs all of our inductive causal inferences;\nand he was also correct that this principle is not and cannot be\nanalytic a priori. What Hume did not see, from Kant\u2019s\npoint of view, is that the merely comparative universality of\ninductive generalization can indeed be overcome by transforming\ninitially merely subjective \u201cempirical rules\u201d into truly\nobjective and necessary \u201cuniversal laws\u201d in accordance\nwith synthetic but still a priori principles of the unity of\nnature in\n general.[52]\n",
