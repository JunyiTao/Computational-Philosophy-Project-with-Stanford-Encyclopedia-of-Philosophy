    "main_text": "\n\nAt the most general level, fitting-attitude theories of value (FA\ntheories) seek to explain various kinds of evaluative facts (e.g.,\nfacts about what\u2019s good, admirable, or delightful) by appeal to\nother normative facts about certain types of human responses. FA\ntheories can differ according to (i) the kinds of evaluative facts\nthey aspire to explain, (ii) the kinds of normative facts about human\nresponses in terms of which they explain the evaluative facts, and\n(iii) the types of responses to which they appeal in their\nexplanations. For example, an FA theorist might propose to explain\nevaluative facts about who\u2019s admirable in terms of\nnormative facts about the fittingness of admiration:\nthey might hold that whenever someone is admirable, that\u2019s\nfully\u00a0because it\u2019s fitting for anyone to admire that\nperson. And they might offer parallel explanations, in terms of the\nfittingness of various other types of response, for a range of other\nevaluative facts, such as facts about who\u2019s lovable,\nblameworthy, despicable, delightful, etc.\n\nExplanations like these are the bread and butter of FA theories. It\nseems platitudinous that someone is admirable just in case\nthey\u2019re fitting to admire, lovable just in case they\u2019re\nfitting to love, blameworthy just in case they\u2019re fitting to\nblame, and so on. What makes these claims of equivalence and their kin\nso plausible is that the evaluative properties they reference each\nseem clearly connected to a human response of a certain kind where the\nrelevant connection seems normative rather than merely descriptive.\nBeing lovable, for instance, isn\u2019t merely a matter of being\nsomeone whom one does or could love; instead,\nit\u2019s a matter of being someone whom it\u2019s fitting\nto love or who merits this attitude. And the same goes for\nmany other specific evaluative properties, including but not limited\nto those mentioned above (Brandt 1946; Schroeder 2010; Way 2012;\nHoward 2018). FA theories offer a natural account of these\nequivalences. For example, the FA theorist can say that what explains\nthe equivalence of being lovable with being\nfitting to love is that facts involving the former property\nare always grounded in, or obtain in virtue of, facts involving the\nlatter.\n\nMany FA theorists aspire to explain not only various specific\nevaluative properties, such as being lovable or delightful, but also\ngeneric value, i.e., the property of being simply good, or valuable\nsimpliciter. Assuming that being valuable\nsimpliciter is identical to being desirable, an FA theory is\nstraightforward: a thing\u2019s being valuable simpliciter,\nor desirable, could be explained in terms of its being fit to\ndesire. Alternatively, if being valuable isn\u2019t (always) a\nmatter of being desirable, then FA theorists might instead explain\nfacts about what\u2019s valuable in terms of facts about what\u2019s\nfitting to value, where this attitude of\n\u2018valuing\u2019 might consist in various pro-responses,\nincluding, inter alia, being glad that, respecting, taking\npleasure in, and protecting.\n\nFA theories have many advantages. For example, they seem to constitute\nan attractive middle ground between \u201cprimitivism\u201d about\nevaluative facts\u2014the view that such facts are fundamental or\ninexplicable in other terms\u2014and\n\u201csubjectivism\u201d\u2014the view that evaluative facts are\nfully explicable in terms of non-normative, naturalistic facts about\nhuman responses (McHugh and Way 2016). Relatedly, FA theories of value\nsimpliciter purport to \u201cdemystify\u201d facts\ninvolving this property (Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004). And FA theories more generally\nstand to provide unifying explanations of the varieties of value\n(Schroeder 2010; Rowland 2019) and to explain the structure of, and\nvarious necessary connections within, certain parts of the normative\nand evaluative domain (Way 2013). But FA theories also face a number\nof outstanding issues, including concerns about circularity and\npotential counterexamples. This entry clarifies the nature of FA\ntheories of value, highlights some important choice points for\nproponents of these theories, and surveys and catalogues the main\nadvantages of the theories and the most pressing, outstanding issues\nthat they face today.\n",
