    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nLittle is known about Isaac Albalag. All that we know about him is\nthat he lived in the second half of the thirteenth century either in\nCatalonia or Provence (Sirat 1985: 238). References to Albalag in the\nmedieval Jewish literature indicate that he was not a figure of\nfavorable reputation. His name appears in a number of Jewish writings\nusually in association with humiliating accusations of heresy. The\nKabbalist Shem Tov Ibn Shem Tov (d.1440), for instance,\naccuses Albalag of heresy for advocating a heretical view regarding\nthe fate of the human soul (Sefer ha \u02beemunot [the Book\nof Beliefs], I:1). In Sefer Neveh Shalom (Indwelling of\nPeace), the fifteenth-century Spanish thinker Abraham Shalom\nattacks Albalag for eliminating the doctrine of creation by radically\nnaturalizing the account for celestial motion (Vajda 1960: 271).\nAlbalag\u2019s worth as a philosopher did not go unnoticed,\nnotwithstanding. Isaac Polqar (14th century), the author of\n\u02bfEzer ha-dat (The Support of Faith) holds Albalag in\ngreat esteem and cites him approvingly in dealing with the\ncontroversial issue of the origin of the world (\u02bfEzer\nha-dat: part II: p.46).\n\nAlbalag wrote only one treatise, Sefer Tiqqun ha de\u02bfot\n(The Emendation of the Opinions)\u2014I here employ Manekin\u2019s\ntranslation of the title (Manekin 2007: 140)\u2014which is a\ntranslation with commentarial notes on the first two sections of Abu\nHamid al-Ghazali\u2019s encyclopedic treatise kit\u0101b\nMaq\u0101\u1e63id al-Fal\u0101sifah (The Opinions of the\nPhilosophers), Logic and Metaphysics. The third section, Natural\nPhilosophy, was completed by Isaac Polqar (Vajda 1960: 268).\n\nTwo goals stand behind the composition of the Tiqqun. The\nprimary one, as the title reveals (Emendation of the Opinions), is\ncorrective. Motivated by confidence in Aristotelianism, Albalag adopts\na critical stance towards any doctrine that deviates from Aristotelian\nteachings and rules. For him, most errors in the philosophical\ndiscourse are instances of deviation from Aristotle or\nmisunderstandings of his teachings. The cumulative literature of\ncommentaries on Aristotle, excluding Averroes\u2019 commentaries, is\nreplete with such instances. Avicenna is particularly regarded by\nAlbalag as a major source of error and thus the process of\n\u201cemendation\u201d (Tiqqun) largely consists in\nsystematic critiques of Avicennian philosophy. But Avicenna is not the\nsole target of criticism, though he is the central one. Albalag also\ncriticizes other philosophers such as al-Farabi, Maimonides, and\nal-Ghazali\u2014it is not unlikely that Albalag thought, like\nMedieval Latin philosophers, that Maq\u0101\u1e63id\nal-Fal\u0101sifah was a genuine representation of\nal-Ghazali\u2019s philosophical view (for al-Ghazali\u2019s\nphilosophical image in Latin literature see Salman 1999; Shihadeh\n2011).[1]\nMaq\u0101\u1e63id al-Fal\u0101sifah encompasses a concise\npresentation of the opinions of the philosophers, and as a result it\nfurnishes Albalag with an ideal framework for pursuing the announced\nprocess of \u201cemendation\u201d (Tiqqun). In most of his\ndiscussions, critiques, and corrections Albalag derives what he\nregards as the correct understanding of Aristotle from Averroes\u2019\nwritings. \n\nThe second goal of the Tiqqun is pedagogical. Here, again,\nal-Ghazali\u2019s Maq\u0101\u1e63id al-Fal\u0101sifah\nserves as an adequate vehicle. Thanks to al-Ghazali\u2019s style\nwhich is free of complexities and accords with \u201cpopular\nbeliefs\u201d, the Maq\u0101\u1e63id provides a suitable\nmedium for instructing students who have little training in philosophy\n(Tiqqun preface: 4). By translating and commenting on\nal-Ghazali\u2019s Maq\u0101\u1e63id, Albalag hopes to offer\na piecemeal instruction in philosophy, starting with a presentation of\nGhazali\u2019s summary of the doctrines of the philosophers and\nculminating in the establishment of Aristotelian demonstrative\ndoctrines. Overall, the Tiqqun follows the structure of the\nMaq\u0101\u1e63id except on some occasions where Albalag\nengages in large digressions.\n",
