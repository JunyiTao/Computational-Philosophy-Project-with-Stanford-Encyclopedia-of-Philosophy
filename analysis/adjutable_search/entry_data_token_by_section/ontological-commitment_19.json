    "main_text": "Carnap and Neo-Carnapianism || Carnap\n6.2 Neo-Carnapianism: Quantifier Variance\nAccording to Carnap, each linguistic framework comes with its own\nunrestricted existential quantifier, and thus its own notions of\nobject and existence. No one of these quantifiers is logically or\nmetaphysically privileged over any of the others; there is no neutral\nstandpoint from which one framework can be judged correct and another\nincorrect. When frameworks appear to disagree\u2014as when one says\nthat arbitrary fusions exist, and another denies it\u2014the dispute\nis merely verbal; they are using quantifiers with different\nmeanings. This is a form of the doctrine of quantifier\nvariance. One might well wonder: don't we get a single,\nprivileged quantifier by combining all linguistic frameworks, and\nconsidering a quantifier that ranges over the union of all the domains\nof these frameworks? But the question presupposes, in effect, that the\nnotion of \u201call linguistic frameworks\u201d is meaningful, and\nthere is no reason why Carnap would accept that. Any attempt to\nintroduce a single all-inclusive quantifier that ranges over\nabsolutely everything would be rejected by Carnap. For what does\neverything mean here, if not \u201ceverything in reality?\nAnd that, for Carnap, is cognitively meaningless.\nEli Hirsch (2002) is a neo-Carnapian proponent of the doctrine of\nquantifier variance, but he differs from Carnap in at least two\nrespects (see also Putnam 1987). First, Hirsch applies the doctrine of\nquantifier variance not just to the quantifiers in artificial\nlanguages, as was Carnap's way, but to ordinary language\nquantifiers. Instead of Carnap's many linguistic frameworks, we have\nmany possible languages including English and (Hirsch would say) the\nsomewhat bizarre variations on English spoken by some contemporary\nmetaphysicians. For example, Lewish, the language spoken by\nmereologists (and named after its defender, David Lewis) quantifies\nover arbitrary fusions, whereas English, Hirsch claims, does\nnot. Second, Hirsch's brand of quantifier variance is meant to be\ncompatible with realism, that there is a single reality in virtue of\nwhich our theories, with their various quantifiers, are made true or\nfalse. This reality cannot, in and of itself, be ontologically\nstructured; it cannot have a metaphysically privileged division into\nobjects, lest one quantifier be privileged over the others. Reality\nconsists rather of unstructured facts that we carve up differently\nwith our different quantifiers.\nHirsch's realism contrasts sharply with Carnap's anti-realism. For\nCarnap, different linguistic frameworks are incommensurable. They\npeacefully coexist, logically isolated from one another. Apparent\nontological disputes are meaningless for lack of a common subject\nmatter, a single \u201creality\u201d that is being disputed. For\nHirsch, on the other hand, each side in an ontological dispute is\nspeaking truly of the one and only reality. The appearance of a\ngenuine dispute arises because they are speaking different languages\nwhose quantifiers have different meanings. Each side of the dispute\ncan translate the others claims into his own language to see that both\nare speaking truly, and that the dispute is merely verbal. The\ndisagreement is over the meaning of words, not the nature of\nreality.\nThis claim of intertranslatability is difficult to maintain (see\nHawthorne 2009). But suppose it can be made good: what would that say\nabout ontological commitment? Since theories that assert \u201cthere\nare Ks\u201d and theories that assert \u201cthere are\nno Ks\u201d need not conflict, one cannot simply look to the\nquantifiers for ontological commitment. Moreover, since no language,\nand no quantifier, is ontologically privileged, it would not help to\nfirst translate into a single language. We could relativize the notion\nof ontological commitment to languages; but given that reality itself,\nfor Hirsch, isn't ontologically structured, none of these relativized\nnotions of ontological commitment would be getting at something of\nontological significance (including the one that gave ontological\ncommitment relative to ordinary language, and ordinary language\nquantifiers). All theories, it appears, are ontologically committed to\nthe single reality, and the unstructured facts that comprise it; but\nthat commitment does not come from quantification. Where it comes from\nis not addressed.\n",
