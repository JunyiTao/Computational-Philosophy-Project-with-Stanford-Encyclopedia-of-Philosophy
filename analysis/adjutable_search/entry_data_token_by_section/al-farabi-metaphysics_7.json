Here he is\nofficially continuing the discussion of particles by explaining the\nmeanings of various interrogative particles in different\n\u201csyllogistic arts\u201d: the main interest is to explain the\ndistinctive meanings these particles have in demonstrative science,\nand to warn against confusing them with the meanings they have in\nother disciplines. This resembles the discussion in Book of\nLetters I, but the particles (and \u201clogical\u201d particles\nwhich are grammatically nouns in Arabic) discussed in Book of\nLetters I correspond roughly to those discussed in\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics V; Book of Letters\nIII, by contrast, picks up issues from Posterior Analytics\nII. There Aristotle discusses the different kinds of scientific\n\u201cquestion\u201d or \u201cinvestigation\u201d\n[z\u00eat\u00easis], and he specifies each one by an\ninterrogative particle (\u201cwhether\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d,\n\u201cwhy\u201d). But Aristotle is interested mainly in the methods\nthe scientist uses to answer these questions; nobody before\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee had thought there was a distinctive\nscientific meaning of the particles themselves. But Aristotle does\ntalk about how the scientist should investigate whether something is,\nwhat something is, and why something is, and F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ntakes this discussion as giving not just a methodology but a\nscientific account of existence and quiddity, i.e., of the scientific\nmeanings of the particles \u201cwhether\u201d and\n\u201cwhat\u201d.\n\nAristotle discusses there four types of scientific question or\ninvestigation, \u201cwhether X is\u201d, \u201cwhat\nX is\u201d, \u201cwhether X is Y\u201d,\nand \u201cwhy X is Y\u201d. His main claim is that\nthe investigation what X is stands to the\ninvestigation whether X is, as the investigation\nwhy X is Y stands to the investigation\nwhether X is Y. So in order to determine\nwhat X is, we must first investigate\nwhether X is, and then, if the answer is yes,\ninvestigate why X is. An answer to why\nX is can be converted into a scientific answer to\nwhat X is; where to discover why X\nis, we must reformulate the judgment \u201cX is\u201d as a\ntwo-place judgment with distinct subject and predicate terms, and then\nlook for a middle term connecting them. In the standard example, if\nX is (lunar) eclipse, before we can scientifically\ninvestigate what eclipses are, we must first investigate whether there\nare eclipses; if there are, and if the nominal definition of (lunar)\neclipse is \u201cdarkening of the moon at opposition\u201d, then we\ninvestigate why the moon is sometimes darkened at opposition; and if\nwe conclude that this is due to the interposition of the earth between\nthe moon and the sun, we can convert this into a scientific definition\nof eclipse as \u201cdarkening of the moon at opposition due to the\ninterposition of the earth between the sun and the moon\u201d.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee takes all this up in Book of Letters\nIII,226 and following, under the headings of the scientific meanings\nof the particles \u201cwhether\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d, and\n\u201cwhy\u201d: or rather, when he says \u201cwhether X\nexists\u201d (or \u201cdoes X exist?\u201d, hal\nX mawj\u00fbdun), both the word\n\u201cwhether\u201d and the word \u201cexists\u201d are logically,\nif not grammatically, particles. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee follows\nAristotle in saying that there is an ordered series of questions or\ninvestigations: first we must ask whether X exists,\nand only then, if the answer is yes, can we ask what\nX is, by asking why X exists. But\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s story is more complicated than\nAristotle\u2019s, because he distinguishes different senses both of\n\u201cwhether X exists\u201d and of \u201cwhat X\nis\u201d. Fundamentally, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that there\nis a series of four questions: first \u201cwhat X is\u201d\nseeking the nominal definition of X, which spells out the\nconcept of X in the soul; then \u201cwhether X\nis\u201d in the sense of being-as-the-true, asking whether X\nexists outside the soul as it does in the soul; then \u201cwhether\nX is\u201d in the sense of being as having a quiddity\noutside the soul, asking rather \u201cdoes it have some thing by\nwhich its constitution [qiw\u00e2m] [is] and which is\npresent in it\u201d (III,229 p.214,6\u20137, cited above); then\n\u201cwhat X is\u201d seeking the quiddity of X\noutside the soul, namely this thing present in X which is the\ncause of X\u2019s constitution. The Posterior\nAnalytics has nothing corresponding to the distinction between\nthe two \u201cwhether X is\u201d questions, but\nPosterior Analytics II,2 does say that when we\nask/investigate whether X is Y, or whether\nX is, we are asking \u201cwhether there is a middle\nterm for it\u201d, and that when we then ask/investigate why\nX is Y, or what X is, we are\nasking \u201cwhat that middle term is\u201d (89b37\u201390a1). And\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee argues that this requires a distinctive\nmeaning of \u201cis\u201d in the question \u201cwhether X\nis\u201d, since X could exist in the sense that it is\noutside the soul as it is in the soul, without there being a middle\nterm between some subject and some predicate which would cause\nX\u2019s existence. There are at least two ways this could\nhappen. First, if X is a privation or even\n\u201cprivation\u201d in general (see III,240 p.218,12\u201315,\nquoted above), or presumably also if X is an ens per\naccidens like white horse, there simply is nothing outside the\nmind by which X is constituted. Second, if X has/is\na simple quiddity, then \u201cX is\u201d cannot be\nexpanded into a sentence \u201cY is Z\u201d where\nthere might be a middle term between the subject and the predicate. So\nonce we have established that X exists outside the soul, we\nmust still investigate whether X is constituted by some cause\noutside the soul, and then what that cause is.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee takes this result as indicating that\ndialectic and demonstrative science give different meanings, not only\nto the \u201cwhat is X?\u201d question and thus to quiddity\n(dialectic seeking a nominal definition, science a causal definition),\nbut also to the \u201cwhether X is\u201d question and thus\nto existence. So he says that, as in dialectic the two-place\ninvestigation \u201cwhether X is Y\u201d is only\nconcerned with the copula (not with whether it is essential\npredication), so in dialectic the one-place investigation\n\u201cwhether X is\u201d is asking only about being as the\ntrue, i.e., about whether the concept of X is instantiated\n(III,246\u20137). He connects this with an inherited problem in\nAristotle\u2019s dialectic: in the Topics Aristotle\nclassifies dialectical problems as asking whether Y is an\naccident of X, whether Y is the genus of X,\nwhether Y is proper to X, or whether Y is\nthe definition of X\u2014so how should we treat the question\nwhether X exists? As F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says, Alexander\nof Aphrodisias in his commentary on the Topics classifies\nquestions of existence as questions of accident, treating the\nexistence of X as an accident of X. And\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that he is right to do so, since\ndialectic is asking whether the concept of X in the mind is\ninstantiated outside the mind, and this belongs as an accident to the\nconcept of X. However, if we mean whether the real thing\nX outside the mind is constituted by some quiddity, or\nwhether X falls under one of the categories, then we would be\nasking whether something belongs to X as its genus or\ndefinition. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also says that different\nparticular sciences give different meanings to these questions.\nNotably, in physics the questions \u201cwhether X is\u201d\nand \u201cwhat X is\u201d are asking for any kind\nof cause of X\u2019s existing, whether that cause is\ninternal to X or not (III,237)\u2014it could be an extrinsic\nefficient or final cause, like the earth blocking sunlight from\nreaching the moon, which would be incorporated into a physical\ndefinition, as in this case of eclipse. Most importantly, in\n\u201cthe divine science\u201d, if we ask whether God is,\nand if we mean by this whether there is some cause through which God\nis\n constituted,[33]\n then while this is a legitimate question the answer can only be no\n(III,238\u20139 and III,243). Nonetheless, we can still ask of God\n\u201cwhether he is some circumscribed essence\u201d (III,240,\np.218,11), and we can discover that he is, not because we can give a\ndefinition analyzing that essence into simpler terms, but because in\nanalyzing other beings and seeking their causal definitions, tracing\nthem back step by step to their causes, we discover that they all lead\nultimately to a single first cause of their existence, so that God\nenters into the fully spelled out quiddities of everything else\n(III,251). Because we learn in this way that God is simple and\ndependent on no cause, we can ask \u201cwhether his existence is an\nexistence which, in order for him to exist through it, needs nothing\nother than itself in any way\u201d (III,242 p.220,1\u20132), neither\na substratum nor an efficient cause, and the answer is yes. So too in\nthe divine science, if we ask \u201cwhether God is X\u201d\nfor some predicate X (whether God is an intelligence, is\nknowing, is one, is a maker or cause of something else\u2019s\nexisting, III,242 p.220,2\u20135), and if we mean by that\n\u201cwhether there is a middle term for it\u201d as Posterior\nAnalytics II,2 suggests, i.e., a cause to God of his being\nX, such as an accident inhering in God, or a part of\nGod\u2019s essence distinct from the whole essence, then again the\nanswer can only be no. But we can also mean\n\n\nwhether the existence by which his constitution is not by anything\nother than he, is that he is intelligence and knowing, and whether his\nessence is that he is intelligence,\n\n\nand in asking whether he is the cause or agent of something\nelse\u2019s existing we can mean\n\n\nwhether his existence by which he is existent, or his quiddity which\nspecifies him, or which belongs to him, necessitates that he is a\ncause of the existence of something other than he, or the maker of\nsomething other than he. (III,242 p.220,3\u20136)\n\n\nAnd again we discover, by tracing back the causes of things to a first\ncause which needs nothing beyond itself to know and to produce, that\nthe answer is yes.
