    "main_text": "Possibilities || Cardinal Information\n5.4 Cardinal Information\n\nAmartya Sen (1970) extended Arrow\u2019s framework by representing the\npreferences of individuals \\(i\\) as utility functions \\(U_{i}\\) that\nmap the alternatives onto real numbers: \\(U_{i}(x)\\) is the utility\nthat \\(i\\) obtains from \\(x\\).  A preference profile in Sen\u2019s\nframework is a list \\(\\langle U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{n}\\rangle\\) of utility\nfunctions, and a domain is a set of these. An aggregation function,\nnow a social welfare functional, maps each profile in some\ndomain onto a weak ordering of the alternatives.\nSen showed how to study various assumptions concerning the\nmeasurability and interpersonal comparability of utilities by\ncoordinating the social orderings derived from profiles that,\ndepending on these assumptions, carry the same information. For\ninstance, ordinal measurement with interpersonal\nnoncomparability\u2014built by Arrow right into his technical\nframework\u2014amounts, in Sen\u2019s more flexible set up, to a\nrequirement that the same social ordering is to be derived from any\nutility profiles that reduce to the same list of orderings. At the\nother extreme, utilities are measured on a ratio scale with full\ninterpersonal comparability if those profiles yield the same social\nordering that can be obtained from each other by rescaling, or\nmultiplying all utility functions by the same positive real number.\nSen explored different combinations of such assumptions.\nOne important finding was that having cardinal utilities is not by\nitself enough to avoid an impossibility result. In addition, utilities\nhave to be interpersonally comparable. Intuitively speaking, to put\ninformation about preference strengths to good use it has to be\npossible to compare the strengths of different individuals\u2019\npreferences. See Sen (1970: Theorem 8*2). Interpersonal comparability\nopens up many possibilities for aggregating utilities and preferences.\nTwo important ones can be read off from classical utilitarianism and\nRawls\u2019s difference principle.
