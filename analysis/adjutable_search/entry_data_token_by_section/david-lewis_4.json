    "main_text": "Counterfactuals || Background\n3.1 Background\n\nTo the extent that there was a mid-century orthodoxy about\ncounterfactual conditionals, it was given by the proposal in Nelson\nGoodman (1955). Goodman proposed that counterfactual conditionals were\na particular variety of strict conditional. To a first approximation,\nIf it were the case that p, it would be the case that\nq (hereafter p \u25a1\u2192 q) is true\njust in case Necessarily, either p is false or q is\ntrue, i.e. \u25a1(p \u2283 q). Goodman realised that\nthis wouldn\u2019t work if the modal \u2018necessarily\u2019 was\ninterpreted unrestrictedly. He first suggested that we needed to\nrestrict attention to those possibilities where all facts\n\u2018co-tenable\u2019 with p were true. More formally, if\nS is the conjunction of all the co-tenable facts, then p\n\u25a1\u2192 q is true if and only if \u25a1((p\n\u2227 S) \u2283 q).\n\nLewis argued that this could not be the correct set of truth\nconditions for p \u25a1\u2192 q in general. His\nargument was that strict conditionals were in a certain sense\nindefeasible. If a strict conditional is true, then adding more\nconjuncts to the antecedent cannot make it false. But intuitively,\nadding conjuncts to the antecedent of a counterfactual can change it\nfrom being true to false. Indeed, intuitively we can have long\nsequences of counterfactuals of ever increasing strength in the\nantecedent, but with the same consequent, that alternate in truth\nvalue. So we can imagine that (3.1) and (3.3) are true, while (3.2)\nand (3.4) are false.\n\n(3.1) If Smith gets the most votes, he will be the next mayor.\n\n\n(3.2) If Smith gets the most votes but is disqualified due to\nelectoral fraud, he will be the next mayor.\n\n(3.3) If Smith gets the most votes, but is disqualified due to\nelectoral fraud, then launches a military coup that overtakes the city\ngovernment, he will be the next mayor.\n\n(3.4) If Smith gets the most votes, but is disqualified due to\nelectoral fraud, then launches a military coup that overtakes the city\ngovernment, but dies during the coup, he will be the next mayor.\n\n\nIf we are to regard p \u25a1\u2192 q as true if and\nonly if \u25a1((p \u2227 S) \u2283 q), then the S\nmust vary for different values of p. More seriously, we have\nto say something about how S varies with variation in\np. Goodman\u2019s own attempts to resolve this problem had\ngenerally been regarded as unsuccessful, for reasons discussed in\nBennett (1984). So a new solution was needed.\n",
