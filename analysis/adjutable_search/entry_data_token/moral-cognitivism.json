A More Detailed General Description\n1.1 Two Negative Constitutive Non-cognitivist Claims\n\nTwo negative theses comprise the central common non-cognitivist\nclaims, although current theories often endorse them only in qualified\nform. One thesis might be called semantic nonfactualism.\nSimply put this thesis denies that predicative moral sentences express\npropositions or have substantial truth conditions. Thus semantic\nnonfactualism suggests that their contents are not apt for robust\ntruth or falsity. (The terms \u2018substantial\u2019 and\n\u2018robust\u2019 are inserted here to make room for minimalist\ntheories which offer deflationary accounts of truth, truth-aptness and\npropositions. Such theories will be discussed in more detail in\nsection 4.1 below.) Moral predicates do not denote or express\nproperties and predicative moral sentences do not therefore predicate\nproperties of their subjects. The second negative thesis can be called\npsychological non-cognitivism. This thesis denies that the\nstates of mind conventionally expressed by moral utterances are\nbeliefs or mental states which fall on the cognitive side of the\ncognitive/non-cognitive divide. Typically non-cognitivists accept both\nnegative theses, though there are views which accept one and not the\nother.\n\nSome non-cognitivists have accepted these theses in their strongest\nform \u2013 moral sentences in no way predicate properties, are apt\nfor truth or falsity, or express beliefs. But most current\nnon-cognitivists accept these negative claims only in a somewhat\nweakened form. For example many non-cognitivists hold that moral\njudgments\u2019 primary function is not to express beliefs,\nthough they may express them in a secondary way. Others deny\nthat their contents are true or false in any robust sense but\nnot that they can be true or false in a deflationary sense\naccording to which there is no substantial property separating true\nand false sentences.\n\nNon-cognitivists deny neither that moral sentences are meaningful nor\nthat they are generally used by speakers in meaningful ways. Thus\ndifferent sorts of non-cognitivist couple their negative theses with\nvarious positive claims about the meanings of moral sentences and\nabout the states of mind that they express. It is the diversity of\npositive proposals that generates the different varieties of\nnon-cognitivism. Emotivists suggest that moral sentences express or\nevoke non-cognitive attitudes towards various objects without\nasserting that the speaker has those attitudes. Norm-expressivists\nsuggest (roughly) that the states of mind expressed by moral sentences\nare attitudes of acceptance of various norms or rules governing\nconduct and emotion, perhaps coupled with a judgment that the objects\nor action under discussion comports with those norms. Prescriptivists\nsuggest that these sentences are a species of prescription or command,\nand may or may not offer an account of the state of mind such\njudgments express.\n\nWhile non-cognitivism was first developed as a theory about moral\njudgments (Ogden & Richards 1923, 125. Barnes 1933) many of the\narguments for the position apply equally well to other sorts of\nevaluative language. Thus most non-cognitivists today extend the\ntreatment to normative or evaluative judgments generally, and the\ndiscussion below will often speak of normative or evaluative judgments\nand terms \u2013 a category which includes as paradigms moral\njudgments, judgments of rationality, and judgments of value.\n1.2 Cognitivism\n\nCognitivism is perhaps best defined as the denial of non-cognitivism.\nCognitivists think that moral sentences are apt for truth or falsity,\nand that the state of mind of accepting a moral judgment is typically\none of belief. They think that typical utterances of indicative\nsentences containing moral predicates express beliefs in the same way\nthat other sentences with ordinary descriptive predicates typically\ndo. (There is some reason to be careful here since cognitivists may\nnot need to employ the sense of \u2018express\u2019 that\nexpressivists need to get their theory off the ground. See Schroeder\n2008a.) Different species of cognitivist disagree about the contents\nof moral sentences and beliefs, about their truth conditions, and\nabout their truth. To discuss all the varieties would require a\ncomplete taxonomy of possible metaethical positions. What they have in\ncommon, however, is that they all deny that an adequate account of\nmoral judgments can be given consistent with the two negative\nnon-cognitivist theses.\n1.3 Contrast with Cognitivist Subjectivism\n\nIt is useful to contrast non-cognitivism with one particular variety\nof cognitivism in order to more clearly present what the\nnon-cognitivist is claiming. Various versions of cognitivist\nsubjectivism equate moral properties such as rightness with the\nproperty of being approved of by some person or group. To be right is\nto be approved of by the speaker, or the speaker and her friends, or\nthe members of the speaker\u2019s society, or everybody. On many such\nviews, when a speaker says something is right she is in fact saying\nthat she approves, or that she and those like her approve. In one very\ngood sense she would then have expressed her approval \u2013 she said\nthat she approved or that she and her friends did. And, if approval is\na conative rather than a cognitive attitude, we might say that she\nexpressed a non-cognitive attitude. But this by itself is not\nsufficient to make the position non-cognitivist. This variety of\nsubjectivism agrees with one of the positive non-cognitivist theses\n(that moral utterances conventionally express non-cognitive\nattitudes), but it does not agree with either of the essential\nnegative non-cognitivist claims (that the judgments don\u2019t\nexpress beliefs and/or that they are not truth-apt). According to this\nsubjectivist theory, the moral utterance expresses the speaker\u2019s\nbelief that she approves of the action and this has truth conditions\nwhich are also the truth conditions of the sentence uttered. When a\nnon-cognitivist says that a sentence conventionally expresses an\nattitude, she means to contrast the mode of expression with saying\nthat one has the attitude. A simple example gets the idea across. One\ncan express dislike of something by saying that one dislikes it. This\nis the way that a cognitivist subjectivist thinks we express moral\nattitudes. But one can also express dislike of something by booing or\nhissing. This is much like the way some non-cognitivists think we\nexpress moral attitudes. The latter way of expressing an attitude is\ndifferent from the way cognitivist subjectivists think we express\nmoral attitudes because it expresses the attitude without saying that\nwe have the attitude (Barnes 1933; Carnap 1937, 28\u201329.) There is\nfurther discussion of this point in section\n 4.3\n below.\n2. Principal Varieties in More Detail\n\nThe principal varieties of non-cognitivism can be distinguished by\nfocusing on the positive claims they make in explicating the semantic\nfunction of moral expressions and the nature of the mental states\ntypically expressed by those who utter them in simple predicative\nstatements.\n2.1 Emotivism\n\nEmotivists think moral terms in grammatically assertive utterances\nfunction primarily to express emotion and perhaps also to elicit\nsimilar emotions in others (Barnes 1933; Stevenson 1946; Ayer 1952,\nChapter 6). They can be read as suggesting that the right way to\nexplain the meanings of such terms is to point out that they are\nconventional devices for performing a certain sort of speech act, one\nwhich if sincere requires that the speaker have a certain attitude.\nSentences employing general predicates of positive moral evaluation\nsuch as \u2018right\u2019, \u2018good\u2019,\n\u2018virtuous\u2019, and so on signal a non-cognitive pro-attitude\nsuch as approval or preference. Sentences employing general predicates\nof negative evaluation such as \u2018wrong\u2019, \u2018bad\u2019,\nand \u2018vicious\u2019 signal negative non-cognitive attitudes.\nThus to call a person virtuous is to express an attitude of approval\nand the speech act of doing so is analogous to the speech act\nperformed when we cheer for that person. The account can be extended\nbeyond general moral terms. Simple predicative utterances employing\nthe so-called thick moral terms such as \u2018brave\u2019 and\n\u2018honest\u2019 can then be thought of as performing this same\nspeech act while at the same time predicating the natural property\n(say fearlessness in the case of bravery) which common usage of the\nterm seems to track. Thus thick moral terms can be thought of as\nhaving both descriptive and emotive meaning.\n\nSome theorists who view themselves as emotivists suggest that even the\nmost general terms of moral evaluation have a descriptive meaning\nrather than just an emotive or non-cognitive meaning (Stevenson 1944,\n22; Hare 1952, suggests the same sort of idea within a prescriptivist\ntheory at 118). One such approach analyzes judgments applying a moral\npredicate to a particular object or action as expressing approval or\ndisapproval of some property while at the same time predicating that\nproperty of the object or item in question. This idea has been taken\nover by contemporary hybrid expressivists (Jackson 1999; Barker 2000;\nRidge 2006, Ridge 2014). According to these theorists, a sentence such\nas \u2018Lying is wrong\u2019 both predicates a property of the act\ntype lying and expresses the speaker\u2019s disapproval of that\nproperty. Theories of this sort will be discussed in more detail in\nthe section on hybrid theories below. They are mentioned here only to\nnote two points: (1) The hybrid idea was already present in the\nwritings of early noncognitivists. And (2) these more complicated\nviews are often adopted by theorists who begin from simpler theories\nwhich are paradigm cases of non-cognitivism.\n2.2 Prescriptivism and Universal Prescriptivism\n\nPrescriptivists suggest that moral judgments are a species of\nprescriptive judgement and that moral sentences in the indicative mood\nare semantically more akin to imperatives than indicatives. One way to\nthink of the idea is that moral terms function as force indicators on\nanalogy with mood. Early prescriptivists thought that this had radical\nimplications for moral reasoning and argument. Carnap suggested that\nmoral judgments are equivalent to relatively simple imperatives. The\nstatement \u2018Killing is evil\u2019 means the same thing as\n\u2018Do not kill.\u2019 On that basis he claimed that there could\nbe no moral knowledge or error (Carnap 1937; 23\u201324 &\n29).\n\nBy contrast current versions of prescriptivism, most developed in the\nworks of R. M. Hare, have attempted to vindicate moral thinking as a\nrational enterprise. The main idea here is that while moral sentences\ndo in fact express a species of prescription much as ordinary\nimperatives do, they express prescriptions of a special universal\nsort. And it is largely because they are prescriptions of this sort\nthat they are subject to various consistency constraints, so that\naccepting one moral judgment carries with it a requirement that one\naccept other judgments in some respects like it. While Hare denies\nthat moral judgments are exactly equivalent to prescriptions\nexpressible in any other form of words, he does tell us a lot about\nwhat they mean. Moral imperatives are universal in a number of ways.\nThey are to apply not just to the agent about whom they are made (if\nthey are made with respect to a particular agent) but also to any\nagent who is similarly situated. And they apply to any action or\nobject which is relevantly similar to the actions or objects about\nwhich the judgment is made. They apply to all relevantly similar cases\nat any time and any place. Thus, very roughly, when one calls an\naction right one is not only prescribing the action in question, but\nalso any relevantly similar action wherever and whenever it occurs.\nAnd the prescription is addressed not only to the agent whose action\nis up for assessment but also to every other person, including the\nspeaker and listeners. In this way, Hare believes, calling an action\nwrong commits the speaker to judging wrong any relevantly similar\naction done at any time and any place by any person.\n\nWith ordinary prescriptions, it isn\u2019t obvious that there is a\nstate of mind that someone must be in if they utter or obey a command\nand which we ought to characterize as accepting an imperative. Hare,\nhimself at one point argues that there is no substantive way of\ncharacterizing the attitude a person must have if she expresses or\naccepts a prescription or moral judgment (Hare 1952, 9\u201311). Even\nso, prescriptivists have some reason for wanting to offer an account\nof accepting a moral judgment if they want to explain moral practice.\nOrdinarily we attribute moral judgments to people, even people who are\nsilent. So the prescriptivist will want to say something about our\nbasis for these attributions. An account of the attitude that\nconstitutes accepting a moral judgment will allow them to ground such\nattributions. One suggestion is that the attitude of accepting a moral\njudgment involves an intention to do what the judgments recommend.\nSincerely accepting a command directed at oneself involves doing it if\none is in circumstances where it applies and one is able and otherwise\nintending to do it should one find oneself in those circumstances\n(Hare 1952, 20). Since moral commands are universal according to the\ntheory, they will be directed at everyone. Thus anyone who sincerely\naccepts a moral judgment will be disposed to do what they believe\nright in circumstances where they can. Less sincere judgments may lack\nthis connection (Hare 1952, 169). The issue of which attitude, if any,\nare involved in accepting a prescription is relevant to some of the\narguments over internalism that we will consider below.\n2.3 Quasi-realism\n\nSince non-cognitivism is a species of irrealism about ethics, it\nshould be unsurprising that many of its main motivations overlap with\nthose for other versions of ethical irrealism, especially with those\nfor error theories. Early non-cognitivists seem most concerned to\ndefend metaphysical and epistemic commitments incompatible with a\nrealist interpretation of moral claims. For example, moral judgments\nseem to be empirically under-determined (Ayer 1952, 106; Mackie 1977,\n39). Hence they fail tests for meaningful discourse proposed by\nlogical positivists. If moral language is meaningful, it would be a\ncounter-example to the view. Thus early versions of non-cognitivism\nwere proposed by these theorists, not so much because they were\ninterested in moral philosophy but rather to render innocuous a\nseeming counter-example to their own theories (Carnap 1937,\n24\u201327; Ayer 1952, 107\u2013109).\n\nMore contemporary non-cognitivists have also been motivated by similar\nunderlying metaphysical and epistemic commitments. But they have been\nas concerned with vindicating the legitimacy of moral practice and\nargument as with anything else. As a result, they have put more time\nand energy into explaining, and in a certain sense justifying, the\nrealist-seeming features of moral discourse in the absence of a\ncommitment to realism (Hare 1952; Blackburn 1984, 1998; Gibbard\n1990).\n\n\u2018Quasi-Realism\u2019 is Simon Blackburn\u2019s name for this\nsort of non-cognitivism, and especially his own version of\nexpressivism. Yet other sophisticated non-cognitivists, notably Allan\nGibbard, have been happy to work under the quasi-realist banner\n(Gibbard 2003, 18\u201319). What especially distinguishes the\nquasi-realist project is an emphasis on explaining why we are entitled\nto act as if moral judgments are genuinely truth-apt even while\nstrictly speaking they are neither true nor false in any robust sense.\nThus it is a commitment of a quasi-realist that normative judgments\nare in an important way different from most (other) paradigm\ndescriptive judgments \u2013 enough so to render problematic their\nstatus as either true or false \u2013 and yet that a justification is\nnonetheless available for our practices of treating them as if they\nwere in fact so. What exactly this comes to is hard to say without\ndiscussing some of the special problems for non-cognitivism in\ngeneral, since it is precisely in offering solutions to those problems\nthat the quasi-realist carries out his program. Thus we will revisit\nthe position later on in the context of these problems.\n2.4 Expressivism\n\nExpressivists of all sorts think that moral sentences are conventional\ndevices for expressing pro and/or con attitudes towards their objects.\nIn this broad sense emotivists are expressivists; they agree that\nmoral language functions to express non-cognitive attitudes of various\nsorts. The claim that moral terms function much like \u2018boo\u2019\nand \u2018hurrah\u2019 qualifies as expressivist in a broad sense.\nIn recent years, however, the term \u2018expressivist\u2019 has come\nto be used in a narrower way, to refer to views which attempt to\nconstruct a systematic semantics for moral sentences by pairing them\nwith the states of mind that the sentences are said to express. Such\nexpressivists hold that the meanings of all sentences containing moral\nterms are determined by the mental states that they serve to\nexpress.\n\nFor this to work, the sense in which moral sentences express the\nattitudes which determine their semantic values must be fairly strict\nand particular. For in one sense perfectly ordinary indicative\nsentences can express non-cognitive attitudes as when, \u2018It is\nten o\u2019clock already,\u2019 can express impatience. And,\n\u2018Lying sucks!\u2019 and \u2018I disapprove of lying,\u2019\ncan each express disapproval of lying. Even so, we should not want to\nassimilate the semantics of these sentences to one another. Thus\nexpressivists of the narrower sort must identify a kind of expression\nwhich allows them to distinguish the way in which \u201cLying is\nwrong,\u201d expresses the attitude that generates its semantic\nvalue, from the way in which \u201cI disapprove of lying,\u201d or\neven \u201cI think that lying is wrong\u201d might express the very\nsame attitude (Schroeder 2008a, 2008c).\n\nThose who have taken up this expressivist program have provided a\nnumber of candidates for the attitudes expressed by sentences\ncontaining normative terminology. Simon Blackburn, whose quasi-realist\nproject was briefly described above, has contributed various ideas not\nonly for the states expressed by indicative sentences but also for\ncomplex embeddings of moral claims. Hybrid theories that put the\nexpressive function of normative language into the semantics\n(discussed below) also involve work of this sort. But the proponent\nwho has developed the program in the most systematic way is Allan\nGibbard. In two influential books Gibbard has proposed two\nstructurally similar accounts each of which employs a different base\nnoncognitive attitude. In Gibbard (1990) the attitude was\nnorm-acceptance, whereas in Gibbard (2003) it was a planning attitude\nakin to intending. In each case he develops a strategy for combining\nthe relevant noncognitive attitude with belief to generate complex\nattitudes that can serve as the semantic values of more complex\nsentences. For more recent developments see Mark Schroeder\u2019s\n(2008c) bifurcated attitude semantics and Silk (2015) developing\nDreier\u2019s (2006) use of preference to impose structure.\n2.5 Norm-expressivism and Plan-expressivism\n\nGibbard\u2019s Wise Choices, Apt Feelings (1990) proposes an\nanalysis of judgments regarding rationality according to which they\nexpress a non-cognitive attitude of acceptance towards rules or norms.\nFrom there he proceeds to reduce other normative judgments into\nvarious more particular kinds of judgments of rationality, so that all\nmoral judgments are covered by the proposed analysis. Gibbard suggests\nthat normative judgments express the acceptance of systems of norms\n\u2013 rules dividing actions under naturalistic descriptions into\nthose which are forbidden, permitted and required. To call an action\nrational is, to a first approximation, to express one\u2019s\nacceptance of a system of norms which allows it. To call an action\nirrational is to express one\u2019s acceptance of a system of norms\nwhich forbids it. And so on (Gibbard 1990, 46). This is only\nGibbard\u2019s idea to a first approximation, since a speaker may not\nhave a determinate system of norms in mind when he or she makes such a\njudgment. So Gibbard suggests we would do better to think of judgments\nto the effect that an action would be irrational as expressing\nrejection of any set of norms which does not forbid it. More\nprecisely, a normative judgment predicating a normative term of a\nparticular action rules out combinations of descriptive judgments\nconcerning the action with norms that either permit, forbid, or\nrequire (as appropriate) actions falling under those descriptions.\nMore complex judgments are captured using the sets of norm-world pairs\nwhich those judgments \u201crule out\u201d to represent the states\nof mind inconsistent with the judgments in question. The basic idea\ncan be illustrated with an example. A judgment that action A\nis permissible is incompatible with a pair the first member of which\nrepresents A as a lie, and the second member of which is a\nnorm that rules out lying. And it is inconsistent with many more such\ncombinations besides. Given this, we can capture the content of the\njudgment that action A is permissible by specifying the set\nof world-norm pairs with which it is incompatible. (A more detailed\nexposition of Gibbard\u2019s technical apparatus can be found within\nthe discussion of the Embedding Problem below and in the supplementary\ndocument\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies.)\n\nGibbard develops his analysis to cover moral judgments by analyzing\nsuch judgments in terms of judgments of rationality. An action is\nwrong if and only if it fails to meet standards of action the\nintentional or negligent violation of which in a normal state of mind\nwould be sufficient for finding the agent prima facie blameworthy. And\nan action is blameworthy if it would be rational for the agent to feel\nguilty and for others to resent the agent for doing the action\n(Gibbard 1990, 45). Since the rationality of guilt or resentment\nreceives a non-cognitive analysis, the approach generates a\nnon-cognitive analysis of moral judgments themselves.\n\nGibbard\u2019s more recent work (Gibbard 2003) retains many of the\nmain features of his norm-expressivist theory but it revises to some\nextent the account of the non-cognitive attitudes involved in\naccepting a normative judgment. On the current view, such judgments\nexpress the acceptance of plans, or perhaps better they express a\nstate of mind that we might think of as planning to act in this way or\nthat depending on the naturalistic circumstances one finds oneself in.\nMore complex judgments embedding normative terms express combinations\nof such attitudes with further attitudes, including ordinary beliefs.\nWhereas in the earlier work Gibbard used sets of world-norm pairs to\nformally capture the contents of judgments, in the later work he\nrelies on what he calls \u201cfact-prac worlds\u201d. Formally they\nfunction in much the same way as the world-norm pairs did in the\nearlier theory. But with the fact-prac worlds apparatus contingency\nplans take the place of norms as members of the pairs. Once again,\njudgements will rule out other judgements represented by a set of\npairs. The judgment that action A is permissible will be\ninconsistent with various combinations of factual beliefs with plans.\nEach of these combinations can be captured by a world representing a\nway the world might be together with a second component consisting of\na plan, representing a commitment to act that the thinker might have.\nFor example the judgment that action A is permissible will be\nincompatible with any pair the fact-representing member of which\nrepresents action A as a lie, paired with a plan that rules\nout lying. And just as a similar idea allowed Gibbard to use sets of\nnorm-world pairs to capture the content of normative judgments, he now\ncan capture the content of a normative judgment by specifying the set\nof fact-prac worlds with which it is incompatible. When the apparatus\nis fully developed, the fact representing members of the pairs can\nonce again be thought of as possible worlds insofar as they specify\nevery detail of the world, and the plans are hyper-plans insofar as\nthey have an answer for what to do in every circumstance. Gibbard\noften calls these fully determinate fact-prac worlds \u201cfact-plan\nworlds\u201d, just as you might expect given what they are composed\nof. The resulting theory might now be called\n\u2018plan-expressivism\u2019 rather than\n\u2018norm-expressivism\u2019 though most of its important\nstructural features are very similar to those of his earlier norm\nexpressivist view.\n\nFurther developments come in the form of Gibbard\u2019s arguments for\nthe resulting theory: Gibbard suggests that people need to plan and\nneed ways to think about and represent their plans. He argues that\nthey would also need to think about what to do from the perspectives\nof various other people and to formulate plans for arbitrary\nsituations they might find themselves in. If these claims are right, a\nlanguage might naturally develop in order to make such thinking\neasier. A planning language modeled by the sets of world-plan pairs\nwould serve very well. And in actual use it would operate much as our\nactual normative language does. It is therefore reasonable to conclude\nthat our actual normative language is of this sort. Furthermore\nconceiving of these attitudes as involving contingency plans for\ndescriptively specifiable circumstances would allow us to explain the\nsupervenience of the moral on the descriptive. The thoughts\nrepresented by the fact-prac world apparatus represent such\ncontingency plans. So the supervenience of the normative on the\ndescriptive falls naturally out of the resulting story (Gibbard\n2003).\n\nSome theorists are unsatisfied with Gibbard\u2019s treatment of third\npersonal judgements, partly because they find the psychology of\nforming a contingency plan for being in another person\u2019s shoes\nimplausible. Ayers (2022) suggests that this aspect of Gibbard\u2019s\nview can be replaced with a third-personal decision that the agent who\nshould act in a particular way act in precisely that way. The view\ntakes on board a commitment to the view that one can decide for others\nin the relevant way. Ayers argues that idea makes sense if one takes\nup certain ideas from the literature on group agency.\n2.6 Borderline Cases and Hybrid Theories\n\nOften philosophical positions are introduced in rather pure and stark\nversions, only to be modified in light of arguments and objections so\nas to become more like competing theories over time. It should not be\ntoo surprising that this is the case in metaethics and that present\nday non-cognitivist theories are less distinguishable from cognitivist\nalternatives than earlier versions. It can even be a controversial\nmatter whether theories developed within the non-cognitivist tradition\nbut modified to handle objections still deserve the label. The\nvarieties of emotivism which postulate both descriptive meaning and\nemotive meaning have sometimes aroused such suspicions and the more\ndeveloped hybrids discussed at the end of this section are in that\ntradition. Furthermore, while paradigm non-cognitivists accept each of\nthe two negative theses outlined above, there are views which accept\nonly one of the two without the other. These positions constitute two\nmetaethical theories which we might think of as borderline cases lying\njust outside the non-cognitivist region of logical space.\n\nHermeneutic moral fictionalists are not semantic non-factualists.\nMoral sentences are regarded as genuinely truth-apt. Such sentences do\nhave truth conditions and an assertive sentence using a moral\npredicate does predicate a property. Yet, in normal use these\nsentences are not strictly speaking true. Thus far the hermeneutic\nfictionalist agrees with error theorists. But while error theorists\nthink that the falsity of moral sentences implies that ordinary moral\ntalk is massively in error, fictionalists disagree. According to the\nhermeneutic fictionalist a speaker uttering a false moral sentence is\ntypically not expressing a belief in the content expressed by the\nsentence. Rather such speakers are using it fictively, and this use\ninvolves no error. Thus, fictionalists are psychological\nnon-cognitivists. Use of a moral sentence does not communicate that\nthe speaker believes the proposition expressed by that sentence.\nRather speakers use such sentences to express other, non-cognitive\nstates of mind. Just as with standard versions of non-cognitivism,\nfictionalists will generally offer a story about the nature of the\nnon-cognitive attitude expressed. For example, they may suggest that\nthe state of mind is an intention to act as if the moral judgment\nexpressing the intention is true (Kalderon 2005b). At the same time,\nbecause they are not pursuing the expressivist semantic program the\nexpression relation need not be exactly what ordinary expressivists\ntake it to be. Since they need not require a one\u2013to\u2013one\nmapping of moral sentences onto states of mind that express them to\nsupport their semantic theory, fictionalists can allow for more\nvariation in the states of mind such sentences (loosely) express.\nHermeneutic fictionalism is often contrasted with revolutionary\nfictionalism. Revolutionary moral fictionalists think we should reform\nour current cognitively committed use of normative language to work\nroughly as the hermeneutic fictionalist thinks we already do (Joyce\n2001, 2005). They are thus not committed to non-cognitivism about\nactual current use of moral terms in the way that hermeneutic\nfictionalists seem to be. Revolutionary fictionalists could be read as\nproposing that we convert to using moral language to express something\nother than belief with our indicative moral sentences, but\nrevolutionary fictionalists have not usually presented their reforms\nin that way. That should not be too surprising. Fictionalist rejection\nof semantic nonfactualism leads most taxonomists to omit fictionalism\nfrom the non-cognitivist genus. Still at least one prominent\nhermeneutic fictionalist has presented his view as a version of\nnon-cognitivism (Kalderon 2005b) drawing on some comments in MacIntyre\n(1981, 15\u201318). (See also Beddor, 2023)\n\nFor more detail on fictionalism see the entry on\n fictionalism.\n\nIn contrast, Terry Horgan and Mark Timmons have propounded a view\nwhich they call Nondescriptivist Cognitivism. As the label suggests,\nthey do not regard their view as a species of non-cognitivism, but\nlike fictionalism the view does accept one of non-cognitivism\u2019s\ntwo constitutive negative theses while rejecting the other. However,\nwith respect to each thesis Horgan and Timmons\u2019s choices\ncontrast with those made by fictionalism. Nondescriptivist cognitivism\nspurns psychological non-cognitivism, but embraces semantic\nnonfactualism, at least insofar as it rejects the claim that moral\nsentences describe the world or predicate genuine properties (Horgan\n& Timmons 2000; Timmons 1999). The precise content of the view can\nbe difficult to pin down. Horgan and Timmons challenge a standard\nHumean division of the mind into a domain of cognitive states which\nrepresent the world as being some way and a separate domain of\nnoncognitive states that do not represent the world. Rather they think\nthere is an important division within the cognitive domain\nbetween beliefs that represent the world and beliefs that do not do\nthis but which have non-descriptive but cognitive content.\nNondescriptive Cognitivism then holds that moral judgments express\nsuch nondescriptive but cognitive states. Indicative sentences apt for\nexpressing these mental states (in one sense of \u2018express\u2019)\nalso semantically express the contents of these\nnondescriptive states just as on a more standard picture indicative\nsentences semantically express the propositions that are the contents\nof sentences that (in a different sense of \u2018express\u2019)\nexpress beliefs. Whether this is in fact a distinctive cognitivist\nposition will depend on the best way of dividing up different sorts of\nmental states. Some will think that Horgan and Timmons have stipulated\na new use for old terms, but they respond by defending\nphenomenological criteria for dividing cognitive from non-cognitive\nmental states that justify counting nonrepresentational states among\nthe cognitive.\n\nHowever that debate comes out, it is nevertheless worth noting the\nview as one which makes trouble for the standard division between\ncognitivist and non-cognitivist views. Together with fictionalism it\nillustrates a position which accepts only one of the two negative\ntheses constitutive of standard non-cognitivism. If such views are\ncoherent this would suggest the two negative theses are logically\nindependent.\n\nHybrid-expressivist theories can be thought of as another sort of\nborderline case but for a different reason. These theorists combine\nthe positive claims of expressivism \u2013 that moral sentences are\nconventional devices for the expression of pro-attitudes and that\nmoral attitudes are (partly) non-cognitive with features of\ncognitivism \u2013 that moral sentences predicate properties and that\nmoral attitudes are (partly) cognitive. There are a variety of ways of\ncombining these ideas and various extant theories adopt many of the\noptions.\n\nWe\u2019ve already noted a tendency for emotivists and\nprescriptivists to allow a kind of secondary descriptive meaning for\nmoral terms over and above their expressive meaning in order to\ncapture the way that moral statements can be used to convey\ndescriptive information. If I know that you are a utilitarian you\nmight convey the information that an action maximizes utility by\ntelling me that it is right. In such cases, what the speaker\nsuccessfully conveys depends on the audience\u2019s knowledge of the\nspeaker\u2019s moral views. One sort of hybrid theorist incorporates\nthis idea into the semantics of moral expressions. Such theorists\nsuggest that moral utterances as a matter of their semantics predicate\na property, one which is determined by the speaker\u2019s moral\nattitudes, while at the same time expressing a non-cognitive attitude\ntowards that property. Proponents hope that the view will have\nadvantage in explaining the communication of factual information with\nmoral terms and with handling the embedding problem (explained below),\nwhile also explaining the motivational efficacy of moral judgements.\nOne implementation of this view equates the main semantic content of a\nmoral predicate with the property it picks out (via a function from\nthe speaker\u2019s attitudes to the relevant properties), while use\nof the predicate conventionally implicates the presence of a pro or\ncon attitude (Barker 2000). A different implementation of the strategy\nincorporates both components into the semantic values of moral terms,\neven while the descriptive content is a function of the non-cognitive\nattitude expressed. More specifically on this way of developing the\nidea, moral sentences to the effect that something is right\nsemantically express both a proposition \u2013 that the action has a\nparticular property \u2013 and a particular positive attitude toward\nthat particular property. The particular property picked out itself\ndepends on the non-cognitive attitudes of the speaker, insofar as the\nproperty predicated is the most general property towards which the\nspeaker holds the non-cognitive attitudes expressed by the very same\njudgement(Ridge, 2006a, 2006b, 2014). One upshot is that the\ndescriptive content of a speaker\u2019s judgements can vary over time\nas the object of her attitudes change. John Eriksson(2009) suggests\nthat R. M. Hare was an early adopter of this kind of hybrid\ntheory.\n\nA contrasting sort of hybrid theory holds the descriptive content of\nmoral predicates constant. Such views are often modeled on slurs or\nepithets, as explicated in a certain way. It is plausible and perhaps\neven standard to think of slurs as semantically expressing a certain\ndescriptive property (being a member of such and such a group, say)\nwhile also conventionally expressing a negative attitude towards those\nwith the property. Copp (2001, 2009) and Boisvert (2008) suggest that\nmoral terms could function in the same way. Here again there are\nvarious ways to work out the details. Advocates of the approach can\nnote that it has advantages over the previous kind of hybrid theory in\nexplaining communication insofar as the descriptive content remains\nfixed from speaker to speaker (Schroeder 2009). And they claim that\nthe view does so without undermining the standard hybrid explanation\nof the motivational efficacy of moral judgements. Other theorists\nsuggest that pejoratives like \u2018idiot\u2019 present a better\nmodel than slurs (Hay 2013).\n\nAs the literature develops hybrid views get more complicated and\nsubtle. Close relatives of these theories claim to elude objections\ndirected at each of the above variants and yet the resulting theories\nare probably best understood as developments of these simpler variants\n(Schroeder 2013;Toppinen 2013).\n\nPerhaps hardest to characterize as a species of non-cognitivism are\nthe claims of several recent theorists who suggest that\nnon-cognitivism is best understood as a metasemantic theory. The claim\nseems to be that non-cognitivism is a theory not about the meaning of\nmoral sentences or about the contents of moral thoughts, but rather a\nstory at a different level about how sentences and thoughts come to\nhave these meanings or contents (Charlow 2015; Chrisman 2012, 2016;\nP\u00e9rez Carballo 2014; Ridge 2014; Silk 2014 at 217). One\nmotivation for the view seems to be that it allows noncognitivists to\ntake advantage of ordinary semantic theories and hence avoid the\nembedding problem. There isn\u2019t yet a lot of literature disputing\nthe idea, but Alwood (2016) expresses some skepticism about the\nadvantages of the approach. It is at least worth thinking about which\nof the standard motivations for non-cognitivism in ethics support the\nview when it is construed as a metasemantic theory. It is also worth\nthinking about exactly how the view contrasts with cognitivist views\non which attitudes can play a role in determining the content of\ncertain expressions, either generally or in particular occurrences.\nChances are the literature will take up such questions in the near\nfuture and subsequent versions of this entry will say more about the\ndevelopments to come.\n3. Motivations for Non-cognitivism\n\nNon-cognitivism is motivated by a number of considerations, most\nrooted in metaphysics, the philosophy of mind or epistemology.\n3.1 The Open Question Argument\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th Century, G. E. Moore\u2019s open\nquestion argument convinced many philosophers that moral statements\nwere not equivalent to statements made using non-moral or descriptive\nterms. For any non-moral description of an action or object it seemed\nthat competent speakers could without confusion doubt that the action\nor object was appropriately characterized using a moral term such as\n\u2018good\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019. The question of whether the\naction or object so described was good or right was always open, even\nto competent speakers. Furthermore, in the absence of any systematic\ntheory to explain the possibility of synthetic as opposed to analytic\nidentity claims, many were convinced that this showed that moral\nproperties could not be identified with any natural (or supernatural)\nproperties. Thus Moore and others concluded that moral properties such\nas goodness were irreducible sui generis properties, not identical to\nnatural properties (Moore 1903, 15).\n\nThe non-naturalists, however, had neglected another option consistent\nwith the thought underlying the open question argument. Perhaps moral\npredicates did not refer to properties at all, and perhaps their\nmeaning was not analyzable in non-moral descriptive terms not because\nthey referred to irreducibly moral properties but because, despite\nappearances, they were not referring expressions at all. In other\nwords, semantic nonfactualism about moral terms entails that questions\nof the sort highlighted by Moore could not be closed by any amount of\ncompetence with the expressions used to ask them because the\nexpressions in question are not in fact equivalent. Thus\nnon-cognitivists could argue that moral expressions used in such open\nquestions did not function to represent anything or to predicate any\nproperty and as such were not equivalent to any descriptive or\nreferring expressions. Rather they merely served to convey emotion\n(Ogden and Richards 1923, 125). Speakers to whom such questions seemed\nopen were tacitly aware of this difference in function and hence not\nin a position to equate moral expressions with descriptive\nexpressions.\n\nContemporary philosophers recognize the possibility that sentences\nthat express identities might be synthetic as opposed to analytic or\ntrue by definition. We can discover that water is the same stuff as\nH2O without being able to infer it from the meanings of the\nterms involved (Kripke 1972; Putnam 1975a). And descriptive\nnaturalists about morality have pointed out that the openness of\nMoore\u2019s question to competent speakers does not rule out the\npossibility of securing the identity of a moral property with a\nnaturalistic property through empirical discoveries that do not rely\non the expressions in question having the same meaning (Boyd 1988).\nYet many contemporary defenders of non-cognitivism suggest that the\nopen question argument still provides ammunition for their claims.\nEven if we cannot infer from the openness of a question that the\nreferents of two terms used to ask that question are distinct, we\nmight still have reason to think that the two expressions do not mean\nthe same thing. Thus non-cognitivists have used the open question\nargument to suggest that moral terms contain a normative element\ncompletely lacking in descriptive terms and which should be cashed out\nalong the lines that the non-cognitivists favor.\n\nThe open question argument can be seen as providing independent\nsupport for what is sometimes called Hume\u2019s Law \u2013 the\nclaim that one can never validly deduce an \u2018ought\u2019 from an\n\u2018is\u2019 (Hume 1888, 469). According to Hume\u2019s Law, no\nset of premises consisting entirely of non-moral descriptive\nstatements is sufficient to entail a moral or normative conclusion.\nThe non-cognitivist is in a position to explain this, insofar as her\npositive proposal for the functioning of moral terms will suggest they\ndo more than merely describe the world. She will say that moral terms\nessentially express a positive attitude, or function to commend.\nPurely descriptive terms do not. Nothing can be the conclusion of a\nvalid argument which is not already implicit in the premises. Thus\ndescriptive claims cannot entail the extra expressive or imperatival\ncomponent that according to the non-cognitivist is part of the meaning\nof moral terms (Hare 1952, 32\u201349).\n\nThere are of course many ways to resist these arguments. Perhaps moral\nexpressions are analytically equivalent to naturalistic expressions,\nbut these analyticities are themselves not obvious even to competent\nspeakers (Lewis 1989, 129). This may be because no analyticities are\nobvious, or it may be because moral analyses in particular are\nespecially complex. One moral that could be drawn from the history of\nTwentieth Century analytic philosophy is that if there are any\nanalyticities, competent speakers can question them. This is the\nparadox of analysis. If any definition can be questioned by a\ncompetent speaker, and we think there are at least some definitions\nsufficient to underwrite analytic truths, then the mere fact that a\nspeaker can doubt a candidate analysis may not tell against that\nanalysis. An equivalence could be analytic because competent speakers\ntacitly respect it, for the most part acting as if the equivalence is\ntrue (Lewis 1989, 130). It has been suggested that moral concepts are\nrole concepts analogous to the concepts of various mental states as\nconceived by functionalists. The idea is that commonsense morality\nembodies a theory of morality which specifies the ways in which\nvarious moral properties (rightness, wrongness, goodness, badness,\nfairness, etc.) are related to each other and to other properties.\nWhen we put all of the claims of the commonsense theory together it\nspecifies a role that each property must play in terms of the other\nproperties it relates to. The role concept so-specified for each term\nmight then be the concept of the referent of that term (Jackson and\nPettit 1995). If so we should expect such concepts to be quite\ncomplex. And their complexity might make it hard to recognize the\nadequacy of any analysis, even for speakers who tacitly respect the\nequivalence so defined.\n\nRelatedly, some theorists have wanted to resist Hume\u2019s Law,\narguing that one can in fact validly draw normative or moral\nconclusions from purely descriptive premises (Foot 1958\u20139;\nSearle 1964). It is actually quite difficult to find an adequate\nformulation that is immune to counter-example, although many theorists\nsuspect there is nonetheless something right about Hume\u2019s claim\n(Humberstone 1996).\n\nThere may be a problem for those more sophisticated forms of\nnon-cognitivism according to which moral terms have both descriptive\nand prescriptive or expressive meaning when these are coupled with\nreliance on the Open Question Argument. Suppose that the postulated\nextra expressive or prescriptive component in moral terms explains why\ncompetent speakers would not equate moral terms with descriptive\nanalyses of them and that it also explains why we cannot validly infer\na moral conclusion from non-moral premises. If moral terms have\ndescriptive meaning in addition to their non-cognitive element one\nshould be able to validly argue in the other direction. The problem is\nthat competent speakers are just as likely to wonder about the\nvalidity of such inferences as they are to wonder about those going\nfrom descriptive premises to normative conclusions. If the openness of\nsuch questions to competent speakers is sufficient to refute claims of\nmeaning equivalence, it should here refute theories which include\ndescriptive meanings in an otherwise non-cognitive analysis. If the\narguments that lead non-cognitivists to postulate descriptive meaning\nare sufficiently compelling it seems they should not rely on the open\nquestion argument to support their views. Woods (2015) presses a\nrelated worry against even non-hybrid non-cognitivist theories. If the\nconventional function of moral terms is to express attitudes, it\nshould seem Moore-paradoxical (that is pragmatically incoherent) to\ndeny that one approves of the things one believes good or right. But\nmany such claims don\u2019t seem pragmatically incoherent.\n3.2 Naturalism\n\nNaturalism in metaphysics has been on the ascendancy for some time,\nthough it is often somewhat difficult to ascertain exactly what the\nposition amounts to. Metaphysical naturalists claim that there are\nonly natural properties, in some good sense of the term\n\u2018natural\u2019. Usually naturalism is taken to rule out at\nleast the existence of supernatural entities or properties. And one\nstandard way that naturalists have defended their position has been to\nreduce seemingly mysterious properties or objects which might appear\nto be non-natural to more familiar purportedly natural properties.\nThat is, they have tried to show that these objects or entities are\nnothing over and above some set of natural properties or objects\nappropriately arranged. One strategy is to identify seemingly suspect\nproperties with natural properties, either via connecting definitions\nor through synthetic identities. In this way the seemingly suspect\nproperties can be allowed into the naturalist\u2019s ontology without\nundermining the commitment to naturalism. Many naturalists have taken\nthis approach to moral properties (Firth 1952; Railton 1986; Boyd\n1988).\n\nNon-cognitivism is not a form of reductive\nnaturalism about the contents of moral judgments, beliefs and\nsentences. It does not equate the property seemingly predicated in\nsuch judgments with any natural property, precisely because it denies\nthat the (primary) function of such expressions is to predicate\nproperties. But in another good sense non-cognitivists are\nnaturalists. They offer a reduction of the attitude of accepting a\nmoral judgment to a perfectly naturalistic sort of attitude such as\nthe attitude of approval or disapproval. And they do not postulate any\nproperties which cannot be reduced to natural properties. Thus another\nmotivation for accepting non-cognitivism has been naturalism. If\nsomeone doubts the prospects for reducing moral properties to natural\nproperties (perhaps under the influence of the open question\nargument), they need not concede that there are any extra-natural or\nsupernatural properties. One can simply reinterpret even the moral\njudgments one accepts as predicating no properties at all. Or, as with\nthe more sophisticated versions of non-cognitivism, one can allow them\nto predicate natural properties and argue that the appearance that\nthey do something other than this is due to the additional expressive\ncomponent in their meaning. One\u2019s naturalism will then not\ncommit one to giving up moral judgments or reducing moral properties\nto natural properties (Ayer 1952, 106\u20137).\n3.3 Motivational Internalism and the Action-guiding Character of Moral Judgments\n\nMany non-cognitivists have argued for their theories based on\nmotivational internalist premises. Motivational internalists believe\nthat there is some sort of conceptual or necessary connection between\nmoral judgments on the one hand and motivations to act on the other.\nThe nature of the connection is a matter of some dispute and theorists\nhave suggested and refuted a variety of candidates (Hare 1952, 20;\nBrink 1989, 37ff.; Smith 1994, 60ff; Darwall 1997). Non-cognitivists\nhave often supported their theory by arguing from versions of judgment\ninternalism, which postulate a necessary connection between accepting\na moral judgment on the one hand and being motivated to act on it on\nthe other (Stevenson 1937; Hare 1952; Blackburn 1998; Gibbard 1990).\nThis sort of internalism is controversial, so that leading\nnon-cognitivists have had both to defend judgment internalism and to\nargue that their favored theory should be accepted as the best\nexplanation of the sort of internalism they attempt to vindicate.\n\nYou can find defenses of various versions of judgment internalism\nwhich support somewhat different but still necessary connections\nbetween accepting or uttering a moral judgment on the one hand and\nbeing motivated on the other. One version makes the connection very\ntight \u2013 if one accepts a judgment one is motivated to do what it\nsays we ought to do. Others are looser, requiring motivation only in\nrational persons (Korsgaard 1986; Smith 1994, 61) or perhaps in normal\nmembers of a community (Dreier 1990; Horgan & Timmons 1992;\n164\u20135). Depending on which version a theorist defends, different\nversions of non-cognitivism can explain the necessity of the\nconnection, although not all versions can be easily explained using\nnon-cognitivist resources. The tightest connection which requires\nmotivation in anyone who accepts the judgment that some action is\nright is rather well explained by a very simple version of emotivism\non which a judgment that some action is right conventionally expresses\none\u2019s approval of that action. One can only sincerely use that\nexpression when one has the attitude just as one can only sincerely\ncheer for some team or person if one has a positive attitude towards\nthem. Sincere utterance requires motivation, that\u2019s part and\nparcel of this sort of emotivist theory.\n\nOn the other hand, this easy explanation of the strong internalist\nthesis has liabilities. Such strong internalism may be too strong to\nbe credible insofar as it rules out amoralists \u2013 those who\naccept moral judgments without being at all motivated to do what they\nrecommend. Such people may be possible and even actual (Brink 1989,\n46; Svavarsd\u00f3ttir 1999). If so, simple emotivism of the sort\ndescribed is refuted because the sincerity conditions for making the\njudgment require the motivation not present in the amoralist. Examples\nsuch as the amoralist have led internalists to posit more moderate,\ndefeasible, but still necessary connections between moral judgments\nand motivation (Korsgaard 1986; Dreier 1990; Smith 1994). More complex\nversions of non-cognitivism can make the connection with actual\nmotivation looser and thereby withstand the amoralist challenge. But\nnot every more moderate internalist principle will be easily explained\nby a corresponding non-cognitivist theory. Some versions of moderate\ninternalism require that rational people will be motivated in\naccordance with their own moral judgments (Smith 1994, 61). It\nisn\u2019t clear what version of non-cognitivism can take advantage\nof this sort of defeasible connection. On any theory where the\nacceptance of a moral judgment is constituted by the acceptance of a\nnon-cognitive attitude, it should be the case that those who genuinely\nhold the judgment have the attitude. This should apply to the\nirrational as well as the rational.\n\nOther responses to the amoralist are available consistent with\nnon-cognitivism. One such response is not to accept a defeasible\nversion of internalism, but rather to claim that amoralists do not\nhave genuine moral beliefs. What an amoralist expresses when she makes\na moral claim that she is disinclined to honor involves using the\nmoral predicate in an \u201cinverted commas sense\u201d \u2013 a\nsense which alludes to the value judgments of others without itself\nexpressing such a judgment (Hare 1952, 145\u20136). Many cognitivists\nhave not found this a persuasive characterization of all amoralists\n(Brink 1989, 46\u20137). Alternatively, non-cognitivists can point\nout that a sentence can conventionally express an attitude even when\nuttered by people who don\u2019t have the requisite attitude. For\nexample, one can apologize without feeling sorry or actually caring\nabout what is at issue (Joyce 2002). But it is not so easy to see how\nto carry this over to the treatment of accepting a moral judgment in\nthe absence of uttering a moral sentence. We would like there to be\ngrounds to attribute the belief or acceptance of a moral judgment to\nthose who are silent on some grounds, and it isn\u2019t clear exactly\nwhat resources are available to a non-cognitivist if it doesn\u2019t\ninvolve being in some attitudinal state. Even if one can sincerely\napologize without having any special feeling or attitude as one does\nso, it seems we would not say of a person that they were sorry unless\nthey had such an attitude. Thus the analogy with apology only takes us\nso far.\n\nHare\u2019s most famous argument for the action-guiding character of\nmoral judgments is the Missionaries and the Cannibals Argument. He\nsuggests an example in which our translation practices seem to\nindicate that when we use moral words from our home language to\ntranslate words and concepts from another language, what is most\nimportant to us is that native users of the language or concepts\ngenerally use them to guide choice and action (Hare 1952,\n148\u20139). If this is right, it establishes a connection of the\nfollowing form: Necessarily the acceptance of a moral judgment will\nnormally incline society members to do what is recommended by that\njudgment. This version will require an intention to act or something\nsimilar in most people much of the time, but it will not require such\nan intention from everybody all of the time. The argument thus\nsupports a version of moderate internalism. And, according to Hare,\npeople who utter general commands that are directed at themselves will\nnormally but not invariably act in accordance with those commands\n(Hare 1952, 169). So this much of prescriptivism fits with the sort of\ninternalism that Hare\u2019s arguments support. But, insofar as Hare\nalso suggests that accepting a command directed at oneself requires an\nintention to act accordingly (Hare 1952, 20), he seems committed to a\ncloser connection between moral judgment and motivating states than\nthe Missionaries and Cannibals Argument vindicates.\n\nThus far we have been considering internalism as a reason to accept\nnon-cognitivism based on a sort of inference to the best explanation.\nInsofar as non-cognitivism can explain the connection between\nnormative or moral judgments and motivation we have some reason to\naccept it. But the explanations so far have relied on the positive\npart of non-cognitivism \u2013 the part that connects the meanings of\nmoral terms to commendation or the expression of attitudes. The denial\nof cognitivism so far has played no role. Since the expressivist or\nprescriptivist component of non-cognitivist theories does not by\nitself entail the denial of cognitivism, a cognitivist could take them\non board and explain a species of internalism just as non-cognitivists\ndo (Copp 2001).\n\nThere is, however, a popular non-cognitivist strategy for arguing that\nthey are uniquely placed to explain judgment internalism. This\nstrategy proceeds from the Humean idea that belief alone is incapable\nof motivating action. The Humean Theory of Motivation, as it has come\nto be known, postulates that motives must always be composed of\ndesires for some end, possibly along with some relevant means-ends\nbelief (Hume 1888, 413; Smith 1987). The theory is supposed to rule\nout any state of mind which both qualifies as a cognitive state and\nwhich would be sufficient to motivate action by itself without\nsupplementation from some independent desire. If moral judgments\nnecessarily motivate, even in the absence of further desires, the\ntheory seems to entail that they cannot be genuine beliefs. They must\nbe conative rather than cognitive states, or at the very least be\ncomposites to which the non-cognitive component is essential. Even if\nbeliefs are also constituents of the judgment, those beliefs will not\nbe identical to it, since they can persist in the absence of\nmotivation while the moral judgments necessitate motives (Blackburn\n1998, 97\u2013100).\n\nThis argument too can be resisted by cognitivists. It presupposes a\nparticularly strong version of internalism. If the nature of the\nnecessary connection between moral judgments and motives is of a\ndefeasible kind, it will be possible for someone to accept the\njudgment while remaining unmotivated (Korsgaard 1986; Dreier 1990;\nSmith 1994). And even a stronger version of judgment internalism might\nbe consistent with various subjectivist cognitivist theories,\nespecially those which relativize the truth of moral judgments to\nindividual agents. Such theories can make the truth conditions for the\njudgments include the presence of certain attitudes in the speaker and\nclaim that speakers are highly accurate in tracking that part of their\ntruth conditions (Harman 1978; Dreier 1990.). Furthermore, despite its\nlofty pedigree, the Humean Theory of Motivation is itself subject to\ndispute (Bromwich 2010; Dancy 1996; Darwall 1983; Nagel 1970; McDowell\n1981; Swartzer 2013, 2018; van Roojen 1995, 2002).\n3.4 Supervenience\n\nIt is relatively common ground among moral theorists that moral\nproperties supervene on non-moral properties. Two items cannot differ\nin their moral properties without differing in some non-moral property\nas well. Or to put the point in terms more suited to the\nnon-cognitivist, virtually all agree that it is inappropriate to treat\ntwo items as morally distinguishable without believing that they are\nalso distinguishable in some other way. If two actions are otherwise\nindistinguishable, labeling one as good thereby commits one to\nlabeling the other as good. Often this thesis is put as the claim that\nmoral properties supervene on natural properties, and this has the\nadvantage of leaving open the possibility of the moral properties\nturning out to be among the natural properties.\n\nSome non-cognitivists have argued that this seemingly uncontroversial\ndatum supports their theories against rival alternatives. Hare seems\nto have introduced the term \u2018supervenience\u2019 to the\nphilosophical literature (Hare 1952, 145) and he suggested that his\nown theory, universal prescriptivism, was uniquely placed to explain\nit. Insofar as moral prescriptions were by their nature universal they\nwould prescribe or proscribe any action which was sufficiently similar\nto the action up for evaluation. Thus Hare included supervenience as\none of the phenomena that any adequate metaethical theory should\nexplain and he counted it as a point in favor of his theory that it\ndid so. But the feature of his theory that did the explanatory work\nwas not its non-cognitivism \u2013 rather it was that it required the\njudgments to be universal in the ways he specified. In fact, Hare\nhimself suggested that the supervenience of moral judgments on\ndescriptive features was part and parcel of these judgments having a\nsecondary descriptive meaning (Hare 1963, 7\u201322).\n\nOther contemporary expressivist theories can use a similar approach to\nexplaining supervenience. Take a version of expressivism which says\nthat a moral judgment that such and such an action is wrong predicates\na nonmoral property of that action and at the same time expresses\ndisapproval of that property. This too will explain supervenience,\ninsofar as the speaker will be committed by that moral judgment to\ndisapproving of anything else with that property. Gibbard\u2019s\n(1990) world-norm pair apparatus in which the judgments express\nattitudes towards norms that pick out actions by their natural\nfeatures will generate the same sort of result. (His 2003 update\ninherits this feature as will be explained below.) Thus each of these\ntheorists is able to explain supervenience. Many cognitivist theories\ncan also explain supervenience. Reductive naturalists get the\nsupervenience of the moral on the natural for free. If moral\nproperties just are natural properties, there should be no surprise if\ntwo items cannot differ in their moral properties without also\ndiffering in their natural properties (Dreier 1993). And while\nnonreductive naturalists and even nonnaturalists may have to offer\nexplanations, it isn\u2019t obvious that these explanations must\nfail. (McPherson ; van Roojen 2023) We might thus conclude that\nsupervenience does not favor either cognitivism or\nnon-cognitivism.\n\nSimon Blackburn, however, argues that the phenomenon of supervenience\nespecially favors non-cognitivism. According to Blackburn, it is not\njust the simple fact that moral properties supervene on nonmoral\nproperties that needs to be explained. Nor is it just that appropriate\nmoral predication must supervene on nonmoral predication, to put the\npoint in a way that does not beg the question against non-cognitivism.\nIt is rather to explain how honoring the supervenience constraint can\nbe a requirement of linguistic competence, even while there is no\nanalytic entailment from nonmoral claims to moral claims. In other\nwords, what needs explaining is how supervenience can be a conceptual\nrequirement even while there is no analytic equivalence between moral\nproperties and any non-moral property. Blackburn thinks that we\nrequire such an explanation even if there are metaphysically or\nnomically necessary connections between moral and nonmoral terms or\nproperties. For, he thinks, it is hard to see how such nomic or\nmetaphysical connections could justify the analytic status of the\nsupervenience thesis. People can be ignorant of nomic necessities for\nit is an empirical matter what natural laws govern our world. And they\nmight be ignorant of certain metaphysical necessities while knowing\nall the truths about the meanings of their terms. So these necessities\ncannot justify the apriori and analytic status that the supervenience\nrequirement has. Or to put the same point differently, a requirement\nto recognize some constraint that one should recognize merely in\nvirtue of having competence with the appropriate terms cannot be\nexplained by citing a fact which mere linguistic competence does not\nput one in a position to recognize.\n\nBlackburn\u2019s favored explanation of the difference in status\nbetween the two claims is roughly as follows: Moral judgments must\nsupervene on judgments regarding natural properties because it is the\npoint of moral judgments \u201cto guide desires and choices among the\nnatural features of the world\u201d (Blackburn 1993, 137). Since this\nsort of explanation makes reference to our purposes in using moral\nterms rather than to an independent realm of moral fact, Blackburn\nthinks it supports a quasi-realist account rather than a\nstraightforward realist theory. He goes on to suggest that because the\nexplanation relies on facts about what beliefs can coexist with\nlinguistic competence, there is \u201cno further inference to a\nmetaphysical conclusion\u201d (Blackburn 1993, 143).\n\nIt should be obvious that Blackburn\u2019s argument is not entirely\nindependent of the arguments for non-cognitivism that we have already\nsurveyed. The claim that there is no analytic entailment from any\nnatural property to any moral property is simply Hume\u2019s Law\n\u2013 a datum often supported through use of the open question\nargument. Thus any reductive naturalist about moral properties will\ndeny that premise of the argument along with the validity of the open\nquestion argument. (Dreier 1993) The thought that an explanation which\ninvolves the practical purposes to which moral judgments are put must\nfavor non-cognitivism over cognitivism might well depend on accepting\na Humean division between inert beliefs and motivating desires.\nAnti-Humeans just think that action-guiding purposes can be served by\nbeliefs concerning genuine properties (McDowell 1981; Bromwich 2010;\nSwartzer 2013, 2018; van Roojen 1995). And cognitivists who agree that\nthe analytic status of supervenience needs explanation will not need\nto deny that such explanations require claims about what the competent\ncan believe; on many understandings of analyticity, analytic claims\njust are claims the linguistically competent must accept (Dreier\n1993).\n\nAllan Gibbard (2003) has recently proposed a new argument for the\nsupervenience of normative judgements grounded in his fact-prac world\napparatus as a representational device for capturing normative\njudgments. Given that account of the content of normative judgments it\nwill turn out to be necessary that those with moral attitudes are\ncommitted to normative judgments which treat descriptively identical\nitems the same for purposes of planning. This is because the plans\nthemselves must be formulated so as to individuate circumstances of\naction using \u201crecognitional\u201d concepts. Thus any two\nrecognitionally identical circumstances will yield the same plan of\naction. If Gibbard\u2019s reasons for thinking that plans must be\nformulated in recognitional terms are cogent, this result would allow\nthe theory to explain the relevant phenomenon of supervenience. It\ndoes not, however, show that a cognitivist theory might not do just as\nwell on its own terms.\n3.5 The Distinctiveness of Moral Disagreement?\n\nTheorists sometimes present the motivations for noncognitivism as\nrooted in the distinctive nature of moral disagreement. For example,\nGibbard (1990) begins with a puzzle about how (for instance) two\npeople who both fully understand the prisoner\u2019s dilemma scenario\ncan still disagree over what it is rational for someone in such a\nsituation to do. It doesn\u2019t seem that they are asking after the\nmeaning of the word \u2018rational\u2019 yet there also\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be any descriptive fact over which they\ndisagree. And Stevenson (1944) begins his book by distinguishing the\nkind of disagreement in play when two people disagree in their\nordinary beliefs from \u201cdisagreements in attitude\u201d which\ninvolve conative clash. Having made the distinction he suggests that\nmoral disagreements involve both, and then uses that diagnosis to\nmotivate his own noncognitivism as developed in the rest of the\nbook.\n\nWhile each of these theorists highlights disagreement, it seems that\ndisagreement is only part of what generates the argument for\nnoncognitivism. On one reading, Gibbard\u2019s argument seems to\ntacitly involve one of the assumptions that makes the Open Question\nArgument seem compelling \u2013 that property identities are fully\ntransparent to competent thinkers. Our confidence that the dispute\nover what is rational in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma dispute is not\nover a descriptive fact seems rooted in the stipulation that all the\ndescriptive facts are clear to both thinkers. But that stipulation\nonly settles the matter if we further assume that the identity of\nrationality and the property picked out the the relevant description\n(if indeed there is such and identity) will be transparent to the\nparties to the dispute. So this reading of Gibbard\u2019s argument\nwill have it stand or fall with the Open Question Argument.\n\nOn a second reading of Gibbard\u2019s argument it emphasizes the\ndistinctive practical or action-guiding nature of moral concepts. What\nany purely descriptive account of the dispute leaves out is that the\nparties disagree about what to do when in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma.\nThis version of Gibbard\u2019s point aligns with Stevenson\u2019s\n\u2013 there is a kind of practical disagreement that purely\ncognitive analyses of moral arguments leave out. If that is the point\nof adverting to disagreement we are back with the motivating concerns\ndiscussed in section 3.3. So it may be best to just think of\ndisagreement as highlighting these prior ideas.\n4. Problems, Objections and Response Strategies\n\nOne strategy of objection to non-cognitivism is to find fault with the\nmain motivating ideas. We have already surveyed many of these in the\ncourse of discussing the arguments for non-cognitivism. We now turn to\nobjections resting on the content of the theory rather than its\nmotivations.\n4.1 The Embedding Problem\n\nNon-cognitivism as it is often presented is incomplete. It gives us an\naccount of the meanings of moral expressions in free standing\npredicative uses, and of the states of mind expressed when they are so\nused. But the identical expressions can be used in more complex\nsentences, sentences which embed such predications. Thus far we have\nnot considered what the expressions might mean when so used. We say\nthings such as the following:\n\nIt is true that lying is wrong.\n\nLying is not wrong.\n\nI wonder whether lying is wrong.\n\nI believe that lying is wrong.\n\nFred believes that lying is wrong.\n\nIs lying wrong?\n\nIf lying is wrong, he will be sure to do it.\n\nIf lying is wrong, then so is misleading truth-telling.\n\nSo, in addition to their analyses of unembedded predication,\nnon-cognitivists owe us an account of the meanings of more complex\nsentences or judgments such as these. Of course there are some\ndesiderata we would like an adequate account to fulfill. (1) One is\ncompositionality; the meaning of a complex sentence embedding a moral\nclaim should be a function of the meaning of its parts so as to\nexplain the ease with which speakers can understand novel normative\nsentences. (2) Another is that it should preserve and explain the\nlogical relations between moral judgements and other judgements which\nembed them, at least for central cases. And (3), we want the account\nnot to require implausible verdicts in attributing attitudes to people\nwho use the sentences. For example, if a non-cognitivist says the\nmeaning of \u2018Lying is wrong\u2019 is to express disfavor towards\nlying, that does not yet provide a good explanation of the attitude\nexpressed by the very same words used in many embedded contexts. When\nthose words occur in the antecedent of a conditional, or when a person\nsays, \u2018I wonder if lying is wrong\u2019 they they are typically\nnot being used to express such disapproval. The point here is not that\nthese desiderata cannot be satisfied. Leading contemporary\nnon-cognitivists have all tried to provide accounts. As it turns out,\nthe task is difficult and generates much controversy.\n\nGeach thought that the second and third desiderata would be especially\nhard to accomplish simultaneously. Normally we believe that the status\nof an argument as valid depends, at least in part, on the words not\nshifting in meaning as we move from premise to premise. But the\nsimplest story of the meaning of moral terms, that they are devices\nfor expressing pro and con attitudes, seems then to require that they\nmean something else when embedded in the antecedents of conditionals.\nConsider the following example from Geach (1965, 463):\n\n(P1) If tormenting the cat is bad, getting your little brother to do\nit is bad\n\n(P2) Tormenting the cat is bad.\n\nErgo, getting your little brother to torment the cat is\nbad.\n\nThe argument is valid. But if the entire meaning of \u2018tormenting\nthe cat is bad\u2019 in the second premise is well explained by\nsaying that it is suited for use in expressing disapproval of\ntormenting the cat, then that meaning cannot be the same as the\nmeaning it has in the first premise (which one might accept even if\none approves of tormenting cats). This doesn\u2019t show that the\nexpression is not being used emotively in the second premise; a\ndescriptivist can agree to that. But it does indicate that more will\nneed to be said to explain what is going on. For straightforwardly\ndescriptive arguments of the same form, the explanation of why the\nargument is valid relies on the idea that the phrase in the antecedent\nhas a constant meaning that it represents both unembedded and\nembedded. This is what Geach has called The Frege Point: \u201cA\nthought may have just the same content whether you assent to its truth\nor not; a proposition may occur in discourse now asserted, now\nunasserted, and yet be recognizably the same proposition\u201d (Geach\n1965, 449). As Geach saw it, if content did not remain constant across\nembedded and unembedded occurrences of predicative moral sentences, we\nwould routinely commit a fallacy of equivocation in arguments. (It is\ndue to Geach\u2019s invocation of Frege in this context that the\nembedding problem is often called the Frege-Geach problem. Searle 1962\nindependently raises a version of the same objection and some credit\nW. D. Ross (1939, 34\u201338) with an earlier yet statement of the\nobjection.)\n\nSemantic nonfactualism, the non-cognitivist commitment to the view\nthat moral judgments do not express propositions or predicate\nproperties, rules out one simple way of explaining matters. (But see\nthe discussion of hybrid theories below and in the supplementary\ndocument\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies.)\n If there is no proposition expressed in normal predicative uses of\nmoral expressions we eliminate one candidate for a constant element\nthat generates relations of implication with other expressions\nembedding the same form of words. Arguably we need some other\ncandidate to provide the commonality. As Geach noted, it isn\u2019t\nplausibly the attitude expressed by the a free-standing sentence since\nthis feature doesn\u2019t always survive embedding as we saw. Perhaps\nit might be some predictable function of this attitude. That would\nserve the goal of providing a compositional semantics for the terms in\nquestion.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just that semantic nonfactualism eliminates a candidate\nfor the constant element uniting embedded and unembedded uses of the\nsame normative expression. Such nonfactualism also serves to\ncomplicate the semantics, because it eliminates a straightforward and\neasy way of explaining how different beliefs can be inconsistent and\nhow one belief can commit one to another. On a standard model for\nbelief in general, belief content is propositional and two beliefs are\ninconsistent when their contents \u2013 the propositions they are\ndirected at \u2013 are inconsistent. And one belief logically commits\none to another when the content of the first entails the second. Those\ntwo ideas, plus an account of what it is for contents \u2013 that is\npropositions \u2013 to be inconsistent is all you need to explain the\nlogical relations among beliefs. It isn\u2019t even really important\nto this general point that the contents be propositions. The point is\nthat if you treat all beliefs as inheriting their logical properties\nfrom the logical properties of their contents in this way, you get a\nrelatively simple story about attitudinal inconsistency and\ncommitment.\n\nOnce you say that ordinary beliefs and moral beliefs represent\ndifferent types of attitude towards their contents (if they have\ncontents at all) you can\u2019t any longer tell the simple story.\nThis remains so even if the theory can allow moral attitudes to have\ncontents in some sense and even if these contents are the same kind of\nthing as the contents of ordinary beliefs. That\u2019s because the\ndifferent relations to those contents (taking different attitudes\ntowards them) will need to be taken into account. The resulting theory\nwill need more complicated inconsistency and inference-licensing\nrules. I\u2019ll use R. M. Hare\u2019s (1952) logic of phrastics and\nneustics to illustrate. Because it furthers my purpose in providing\nthis example I\u2019m going to assume that sincere speech acts using\nmoral terms express attitudes and that these attitudes are what we\nattribute when say they believe something about morality. This may be\nmore than Hare was committed to himself.\n\nHare thought we could model the logic of speech acts by employing one\nelement that represented a possible way things might be (the phrastic)\nand a second element that in effect gave instruction for how to\ninterpret the point of the representation (the neustic). For our\npurposes here we can think of the first element as the contents of the\nattitude expressed by the speech act and it would not distort the\ntheory too much to say they are propositions. On this way of\npresenting things, several different speech acts expressing a number\nof different attitudes will all involve the same phrastic. The\ndifferences between them will be represented by differences in the\nneustic. The belief that P will be expressed by a speech act\nwhich is represented by a neustic that reflects the status of\nassertion and a phrastic that represents P. A question about\nwhether P is the case will be represented by the same\nphrastic, but a different neustic \u2013 the one that represents the\nspeech act as a question rather than an assertion. The sentence which\nexpresses the thought that P is good (say) will also employ\nthis same phrastic. What distinguishes it from the first two is once\nagain the neustic which will reflect that this judgement is a\nuniversal prescription to bring about P. This means that we\ncannot compute the logical compatibility or incompatibility of two\njudgements by noting the compatibility or incompatibility of their\nphrastics which we are treating as their contents. The assertion of\nP and the attitude it expresses is different from the\nassertion that P is good and the attitude it expresses.\nStandard semantic theory captures this by assigning these judgements\ndifferent contents. Within the theory which treats the phrastic as the\ncontent, the difference must be captured by assigning them different\nneustics as a reflection that they\u2019re supposed to be different\nkinds of speech acts and to express different kinds of attitudes.\nThere isn\u2019t yet a problem with that. But insofar as the\njudgements clearly have different consistency conditions and involve\ndifferent logical commitments the resulting logic must now include\nprinciples that allow differences in attitude type to matter to\nconsistency and inconsistency.\n\nHare was aware of the point. And if we were dealing with only a few\ndifferent types of attitude and corresponding expressive speech act it\nshould be no difficulty at all. But once we introduce new sentences\njoining the terms we have so far with logical connectives we are\nlikely to need to postulate yet further attitude types and to need\nfurther principles to capture their logical properties. Such complex\nsentences express attitudes that don\u2019t reduce to the attitudes\nwhich would be expressed by either conjunct (Schroeder 2008c, 49). It\nwould thus be wrong to equate the attitude expressed with either\naccepting the one attitude or accepting the other. Relatedly, a speech\nact \u201casserting\u201d a disjunction with one normative disjunct\nand one non-normative disjunct should be a new kind of speech act. It\ndoesn\u2019t universally prescribe anything, nor (on the theory\nwe\u2019re working with) does it assert anything. And similarly for\nthe attitude expressed by that speech act. It will be a new type of\nstate of mind. So we\u2019ll need a new sort of neustic to capture\nthe kind of speech act this is. And we\u2019ll need additional rules\nto tell us about the logic of speech act types represented by those\nneustics.\n\nSchroeder (2008b, 2008c) dubs the distinction between inconsistencies\nthat involve one attitude-type directed towards inconsistent contents,\nA-type inconsistencies and contrasts them with B-type inconsistencies\nwhich postulate inconsistencies that stem from incoherences between\nthe attitude types in conjuction with their contents. For example\napproving of a proposition and disapproving of the same proposition is\ninconsistent (if it is) not in virtue of directing one and the same\nattitude at inconsistent propositions, but rather because two\nallegedly incompatible attitude-types are directed at the same\nproposition. And he notes that the clearest examples of genuine\ninconsistency \u2013 beliefs in contradictories and intentions to\npursue inconsistent courses of action \u2013 seem to be A-type. He\nfurther suggests that this would be a reason to prefer an A-type model\nif non-cognitivists could construct one.\n\nNon-cognitivists have developed various ingenious strategies for\nconstructing a theory that preserves the intuitive logical relations\nbetween normative attitudes, non-normative attitudes and various mixed\nattitudes, along with the sentences that express them. We will briefly\nsurvey some main variants below. For a more thorough survey see the\nsupplementary document\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies,\n which can be read in place of the remainder of section 4.1.\n\nMuch of the recent innovation in developing non-cognitivist theories\nis motivated by a desire to address the embedding problem. In what\nremains of this section we will briefly survey three differing\napproaches to the task, which may also be combined. These are (1)\ndeveloping a logic of the sentences by explaining how that logic falls\nout of logical relations among the attitudes they express, (2)\nexploiting minimalism with regard to truth and related notions to\nprovide an account of certain locutions, and (3) allowing the\ndescriptive semantic component postulated by hybrid expressivist\ntheories to explain the logical relations among normative sentences\nand attitudes.\n4.1.1 A logic of attitudes\n\nThe idea behind a logic of attitudes is to change the normal order of\nexplanation to explain why normative sentences and attitudes bear the\nlogical relations that they do to other sentences and attitudes. As\nnoted above, standard cognitivist accounts of a domain of discourse\nwill explain the consistency or inconsistency of states of mind by\nciting the consistency or inconsistency of that state\u2019s content,\nthat is what it represents. The belief that dogs howl is inconsistent\nwith the belief that dogs don\u2019t howl because their contents\n(that dogs do or don\u2019t howl) are inconsistent with one another.\nAnd similarly for the sentences expressing those beliefs. Since\nnoncognitivists don\u2019t postulate such representational contents\nthey can\u2019t deploy that explanation. But they might still be able\nto do justice to the fact that normative judgments and sentences stand\nin logical relations to one another if they can explain how the\njudgments themselves stand in certain logical relations to to one\nanother and then go on to explain that the sentences are inconsistent\njust because they express judgments that are inconsistent.\n\nOne such approach has been to suggest that the complex moral or\nnormative judgments are higher order attitudes aimed at the judgements\nthat would be expressed by the sentences which they embed. These\nhigher order attitudes might either be complex beliefs (Blackburn\n1971) or further non-cognitive judgments (Blackburn 1984) expressed by\nthe corresponding complex sentences. The hope is that these judgments\nwill have rational connections to the other judgments that are likely\nto play a role in valid arguments. If all goes well, a kind of\npragmatic incoherence or irrationality will be involved when someone\naccepts the judgments of a valid argument so analyzed while at the\nsame time rejecting the conclusion. Such a speaker would be in a state\nsimilar to those uttering sentences of the sort that feature in\nMoore\u2019s paradox, such as \u2018It is raining but I don\u2019t\nbelieve that it is.\u2019\n\nA simple example of this sort of approach comes from Blackburn.\nConditionals express higher order attitudes towards accepting certain\nconjunctions of attitudes. \u201cIf lying is wrong, telling your\nlittle brother to lie is wrong,\u201d (when sincerely uttered)\nexpresses approval of making disapproval of getting one\u2019s\nbrother to lie \u201cfollow upon\u201d disapproval of lying.\n\n\u2026Anyone holding this pair [the above attitude, plus the\nattitude expressed by \u2018lying is wrong\u2019] must hold the\nconsequential disapproval: he is committed to disapproving of getting\nlittle brother to lie, for if he does not his attitudes clash. He has\na fractured sensibility which cannot itself be an object of approval.\n(Blackburn 1984, 195)\n\n\nLogical entailments involving moral judgments are explained as\nfollows: A constellation of attitudes which includes the attitudes\nexpressed by the conditional and by the seemingly assertive premises\nbut not those expressed by the conclusion is irrational, because it\ngoes against the purposes of moral discourse. Somewhat more\nsophisticated ways of developing this strategy can be worked out but\nthe basic idea is well exemplified in this proposal. The logic of\nattitudes strategy has met with much resistance on the part of\ncognitivists. One line of thought is that these proposals conflate\ngenuine inconsistency with mere pragmatic incoherence (Hale 1986;\nSchueler 1988; Brighouse 1990; Zangwill 1992; van Roojen 1996). And\nnon-cognitivists have responded with increasingly more sophisticated\nproposals about the logic of attitudes, including several proposals\nthat do not employ higher order attitudes (Baker & Woods 2015;\nBlackburn 1988b; Gibbard 1990, 2003; Horgan and Timmons 2006b;\nSchroeder 2008a, 2008b, 2008c, Silk 2015). These are discussed in more\ndetail in the supplementary document\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies.\n4.1.2 Minimalism\n\nSome have suggested that minimalism or deflationism about truth or\ntruth aptness can allow non-cognitivists to bypass some of the above\ndebates. (Stoljar 1993) A very rough characterization of minimalism\nabout truth will hopefully suffice to explain. Minimalist theories are\noften presented by contrast with theories of truth according to which\ntruth is some sort of \u201csubstantial\u201d relation or property.\nFor example correspondence theories which claim that truth involves a\nreal relation between truth-bearers and reality are often cited as\nparadigm cases of a substantial theory of truth. Most minimalists\nabout truth suggest that truth is not such a substantial property.\nDifferent minimalists formulate their positive claims in somewhat\ndifferent ways. One version suggests that all you need to know to\nunderstand the \u2018is true\u2019 locution is that it is\nappropriate to use it in conjunction with any indicative sentence\nwhich is itself appropriate in the context of use. To call a sentence\ntrue is just to assert or affirm the sentence (Ramsey 1927). There are\nother variants besides this one. What we need to note is just that the\nsuggestion helps explain the meaning of normative sentences in only\none embedded context, namely the one in which it is embedded along in\nan \u2018is true\u2019 construction. Extensions of this minimalist\nstrategy have attempted to deploy minimal conceptions of other notions\nsuch as truth-aptness, proposition (Horwich 1990, 18\u201322) and\nmore besides to extend the account to normative sentences seeming to\nemploy these notions. The explanations allow noncognitivists to\nexplain our use of terms that seem to express realist commitments.\nStill it is a further step to conclude that this will enable\nnoncognitivists to use them to do the same explanatory work as\nrealists do when they use those terms. But in fact some minimalists\nhave even claimed that they do. Discussion of those proposals is found\nin the supplementary document\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies.\n Some of the points about order of explanation in section\n 5.2\n below are also relevant to the issue of how much work minimalism can\nreally do.\n4.1.3 Piggybacking on the Descriptive Content in a Hybrid Theory\n\nWe noted earlier that non-cognitivists have long granted to evaluative\nutterances and thoughts some secondary \u201cdescriptive\nmeaning\u201d and that hybrid theorists have gone on to give that\ndescriptive content nearly co-equal status. One motivation for such\nviews is rooted in a strategy for solving the embedding problem:\nHybrid theorists hope to explain logical relations among moral\njudgements by using the descriptive component of meaning to do much of\nthe work. Hybrid theorists have differed over whether the\nnon-cognitive component is expressed semantically by some component of\nthe sentence or pragmatically. Still hybrid theorists tend to agree\nthat the belief contents are part of the semantic values of the\nsentences that express them (Jackson 1999, Barker 2000; Copp 2001;\nRidge 2006a, 2006b, 2014; Boisvert 2008; Copp 2009). This would seem\nto entail that these sentences are inconsistent with any judgement\nthat a sentence expressing only the belief component would be\ninconsistent with. Hybrid theorists can thus use the alleged\ndescriptive component of the meanings of moral judgments to generate\nmost of the required logical relations that moral judgements bear to\nother judgements, supplementing the basic account just enough to\naccount for complications introduced by the non-cognitive component of\nrelevant judgements.\n\nCognitivists have raised doubts about the adequacy of several of these\nproposals due to the manner in which the descriptive meaning is\ndetermined by many of these theories (van Roojen 2005; Schroeder 2009)\nand how they can be used to communicate the content they allegedly\nhave (Schroeder 2009). Hybrid theorists have, of course, resisted\nthese complaints (Alm 2007, Ridge 2007; Eriksson 2010). and hybrid\ntheories that take epithets and slurs as their model aren\u2019t\nsubject to the same objections (Copp 2001, 2009; Boisvert 2008). A\nmore thorough discussion of these issues can be found in the\nsupplementary document\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies.\n4.2 The Wishful Thinking Objection, Moral Reasoning, and Moral Uncertainty\n\nA well-known objection to non-cognitivism pays close attention to the\ndistinction between explaining logical relations on the one hand, and\nexplaining the use of moral judgments in reasoning on the other. Even\nif the embedding problem is solved, so that we know what moral\nutterances mean and what complex sentences embedding them also mean,\nwe might still think it irrational to reason in accordance with\nordinary logical principles applied to such judgments. The basic idea\nhere is that conditionals with moral antecedents and nonmoral\nconsequents should, together with the moral judgment in the\nantecedent, license acceptance of the consequent. Thus someone who\naccepts such conditionals would be rational to infer the consequent\nupon coming to accept the antecedent. But if expressivism is correct,\naccepting the antecedent just is holding a non-cognitive attitude.\nThus the licensed inference is really a form of wishful thinking, for\na non-cognitive change of attitude has licensed a change of belief.\nFor example, suppose someone accepts a judgment expressible by saying,\n\u201cIf doing an action is wrong, George will do it.\u201d Normally\nwe think that it would be rational for that person to infer the belief\nthat George will hit Sam upon coming to accept that hitting Sam is\nwrong. But according to non-cognitivism, coming to accept that hitting\nSam is wrong is just a change of non-cognitive attitude, and it can\nseem wrong to think that a change in such attitudes can rationalize a\nchange in belief. It looks like the non-cognitivist is committed to\napproving of something analogous to wishful thinking. That is they\nbelieve something, not because of a change in their evidence but\nbecause of a change in attitude alone (Dorr 2002). Enoch (2003)\npresents an early response which is criticized in (Schroeder 2011,\nchapter 9). See also (Budolfson 2011; Lenman 2003; Mabrito 2013;) who\ngenerally support the idea that solving the Frege-Geach problem will\nbe sufficient for handling Dorr\u2019s wishful thinking objection.\nBut van Roojen (2019) argues that Dorr is right to want something\nbeyond a solution to Frege-Geach. Logic can rule out certain\ncombinations of belief, but does not on its own tell us which member\nof a bad combination to get rid of. But the difference between good\nand bad reasoning may depend on which is retained, and this in turn\ndepends on one\u2019s evidence. Dorr\u2019s argument might then\nsuggest that noncognitivists need to explain how the relevant\nnoncognitive attitudes can relate badly or well to such evidence. And\nthis may contravene Humean arguments for noncognitivism.\n\nAnother issue to do with moral reasoning has to do with uncertainty,\ninsofar as we can be uncertain of our moral judgements and this will\naffect how we reason with them. Michael Smith (2002) argues that\nnon-cognitivists have insufficient resources to distinguish variations\nin moral certainty from differences in both the perceived importance\nof what is being judged right or wrong and in the stability of such\njudgements under the influence of new information. The gradable\ndimensions of desire seem to be strength and stability. If strength is\nused to represent importance and stability to capture stability of\njudgements in the face of new information, desires will lack a\ndimension to represent the certainty with which the moral judgement is\nheld. Cognitivists, by contrast, can allow perceived importance to be\ncaptured by a further belief \u2013 the belief that the matter is of\na certain importance. So they can let certainty just be a matter of\ncredence and robustness in the face of new evidence be just what it\nseems. Non-cognitivists, as usual, won\u2019t just concede the point.\nRather they will explain how their theories have the resources to make\nthe needed distinctions. Lenman (2003c), Sepielli (2012), Eriksson and\nFranc\u00e9n Olinder (2016), and Ridge (2020) are responses in this\nvein. A series of papers and a book by Krister Bykvist and co-authors\n(Bj\u00f6rkholm, Bykvist, & Olson, 2021; Bykvist & Olson 2009,\n2012, 2017; MacAskill, Bykvist & Ord 2020) criticizes each of the\nafformentioned noncognitivist proposals. Finally, Staffel (2019)\noffers an original account of credence for non-cognitivists and\nresponds to Smith\u2019s argument along the way.\n4.3 Non-cognitivism and Relativism\n\nIt has seemed obvious to many that non-cognitivism has much in common\nwith various relativist metaethical views. Though non-cognitivists may\ndeny that the truth values of moral judgments are relative to speakers\nor agents and their attitudes, non-cognitivists do accept a\nconstitutive connection between a speaker\u2019s attitudes and their\nmoral judgements. Specifically, non-cognitivists hold that it is\nsemantically appropriate for a person to utter a moral judgment\nwhenever she wishes to express the relevant non-cognitive attitude.\nThis has led some to suggest that noncognitivists must agree with old\nfashioned subjectivists about the truth conditions for moral\nutterances. (Jackson and Pettit 1998; Suikkanen 2009; Peacocke 2004)\nMany noncognitivists in fact believe that there are few rational\nconstraints on holding the relevant attitudes. And then it is hard to\nsee how consistent moral judgments can be mistaken (Carnap 1937, 30;\nHare 1963, 110). Thus if relativism is problematic, it may seem that\nnon-cognitivism inherits the problems. Still, it is worth noting that\narguments to this effect import extra premises that noncognitivists do\nnot and need not accept. Semantic appropriateness need not (and should\nnot if expressivists are right) be construed as truth. Expressivists\nthink that it is semantically appropriate to use a moral sentence when\none has the attitude that it expresses. This commitment is parallel to\nthe claim that it is semantically appropriate to use \u201cGrass is\ngreen\u201d when one believes that grass is green. (Schroeder 2014,\nsee also Barker 2000 and Dreier 2004a) That a cognitivist should agree\nthat this use is appropriate does not commit cognitivists to the claim\nthat the truth of \u201cGrass is green\u201d turns on one\u2019s\nbeliefs.\n\nNon-cognitivists claim that whether or not a moral judgment is\nmistaken is itself a matter for moral theorizing. A speaker should\nonly call a moral judgment true if he or she accepts that judgment. A\nspeaker who expresses his or her acceptance of relativism in the\nnormal way might say something such as \u201cThey\u2019re both\nsaying something true\u201d. This might seem to be expressing\ncommitment to a very deferential moral theory \u2013 one according to\nwhich each agent should just do what she believes is right. The\nnon-cognitivists who adopt this response argue that this natural\ninterpretation of such claims is correct. What may seem to be a higher\nlevel metaethical claim \u2013 that no consistent set of moral\njudgments is mistaken \u2013 , is really just another moral judgment\nand hence one which would be rejected by any moral judge with\nsubstantive moral commitments (Blackburn 1998, 296 & 304; Timmons\n1999; Horgan and Timmons 2006c). If this line of argument works it\nwill allow non-cognitivism to gain the allegiance of those who wish to\ndeny relativism while giving the motivations that lead to both it and\nnon-cognitivism their due.\n4.4 Capturing The Varieties of Normative Thought Within A Non-cognitivist Metaethic\n\nMany think it a desideratum in metaethical theorizing that a candidate\ntheory be consistent with all or most normative theories actually\ndefended by serious normative ethical proponents. This idea has played\nsome role in the debate over the embedding problem insofar as some of\nthe proposals have been inconsistent with substantive positions taken\nin the debate about the possibility of moral dilemmas (Gibbard 1990,\n88; Shea 2024; van Roojen 1996, 324). But even aside from that\nparticular issue, the desideratum can make a good deal of work for the\nnon-cognitivist because of the variety of kinds of moral theory and\nthe variety of differing but allegedly consistent judgments proposed\nby theorists.\n\nAs a simple example, non-cognitivists need to be able to distinguish\nis that judgements of rightness from judgments of goodness. According\nto standard non-consequentialist theories, rightness and goodness can\ncome apart. In other words, a right action can be such as not to\nproduce the most goodness. Of course consequentialists deny this, and\nnon-consequentialists who use agent-relative values to specify the\nrightness of actions can also deny that rightness and goodness come\napart in this way (Broome 1991, chapter 1). But even if they are\nincorrect as a matter of substantive moral philosophy, it would seem\nthat competent moral judges can hold views of the sort described\nwithout contradiction. Non-cognitivists would like to be able to give\nan explanation of this consistent with their analyses. Hence they need\na way of distinguishing the psychological states involved in making\nthe two sorts of judgment.\n\nA salient strategy for distinguishing rightness and goodness\njudgements might be to claim that they attach to different things\n\u2013 rightness to actions and goodness to states of affairs. Still\nit seems that competent speakers can and do consistently judge certain\nactions right but not good. A different strategy would be to\ndistinguish varieties of positive attitudes such that one sort\ninvolves a kind of approval distinctive of rightness, whereas another\ninvolves a kind distinctive of goodness. Yet another method would be\nto use something like the two step approach Gibbard uses when he\nanalyzes judgments of rightness in terms of judging it rationally\nappropriate to feel guilt and anger at certain actions. The approval\ncould be all of the same sort, but the objects of approval might be\nfeelings of guilt in one case and feelings of sorrow in the other,\neven when these feelings are directed at one and the same object such\nas an action. No doubt there are other available strategies so the\nproblem does not by itself constitute an objection. It can however\ncomplicate the task of constructing an adequate non-cognitivist\ntheory, especially since it can impact the force of other objections\nas with the embedding problem and moral dilemmas noted above.\n\nSection 4.1 above explained the embedding problem, which involves\ncoming up with a compositional theory of meaning for sentences that\nembed indicative moral sentences. And the discussion in that section\nwas largely focussed on embeddings involving operations such as\nnegation, conjunction, disjunction and conditionalization and the\nlogical adequacy of various accounts of these. We also embed moral and\nnormative sentences in attitude reports involving a variety of\nattitudes. It seems plausible that noncognitivists should interpret\nbelief reports such as \u201cJasmine believes that lying is\nwrong,\u201d to attribute to Jasmine the attitude (which according to\nexpressivism) is expressed by \u2018lying is wrong\u2019. But we can\nattribute other attitudes towards what a cognitivist might think to be\nthe same proposition. Jasmine might wonder whether lying is wrong, or\nwish it was not wrong. Or be glad that it is. The noncognitivist will\nneed an account of what it is to have these attitudes and this account\nwill need to fit coherently with their account of what it is to\nbelieve that lying is wrong. This is what Schroeder (2010 at 84) calls\nthe \u201cMany Attitudes problem\u201d. See also Carr (2015),\nK\u00f6hler (2017), Shiller (2017), Beddor (2020a) and Baker\n(2021)\n\nRelatedly, noncognitivists will want to distinguish moral judgements\nfrom aesthetic judgements and from other favorable or unfavorable\nattitudes, if only to distinguish genuine disagreement from seeming\ndisagreement. Alex Miller (2003 at 43\u201351) dubs this the\n\u201cSpecification Problem\u201d and it is taken up by Merli (2008)\nand Bj\u00f6rnsson & McPherson (2014). (Blackburn 1998 at\n13\u201314 professes skepticism that such a division can be\nmade.)\n5. Can The Cognitivist/Non-cognitivist Distinction Be Sustained?\n\nNon-cognitivist success in handling the embedding problem and related\nworries about reasoning would put non-cognitivists in a stronger\nargumentative position. But some commentators have suggested that\nsuccess at this endeavor might be a mixed blessing. Success may\nindicate not that non-cognitivism is the right account of moral\njudgments, but instead that the contrast with cognitivism is not stark\nenough to make out a real distinction. Perhaps the distinction between\ncognitivism and non-cognitivism collapses as non-cognitivist theories\nare modified to capture all of the phenomena that cognitivists\nchallenge them to explain. While both its advocates and those who\nargued strenuously against it would likely find themselves somewhat\ndisoriented if this were correct, it does seem that non-cognitivists\nwould be most upset by this result. For their position was defined by\ndenying key components of standard realist positions. If the\ncognitivist/non-cognitivist dichotomy does not hold up, it would seem\nto show either that the standard positions were not after all\ncommitted to those components, or that those commitments could not be\navoided by plausible theories.\n\nEarly versions of non-cognitivism did not seem subject to this sort of\nobjection, precisely because they did not worry much about vindicating\noverall moral practice. Carnap (1937, 30\u201331) was happy to\nconvict ordinary moral thinking of error. But as non-cognitivists have\nattempted to make sense of and explain most of the seemingly realist\nfeatures of moral practice, it might seem hard to sustain the claim of\na sharp contrast between factual language on the one hand and\nnormative language on the other. Several challenges based on roughly\nthis idea find a home in the recent literature.\n5.1 Sophisticated Non-cognitivism vs. Sophisticated Cognitivist Relativism\n\nOne way to push the point is to challenge the non-cognitivist to\ndistinguish non-cognitivism from cognitivist relativism. A speaker\nrelativist is in a particularly good position to highlight the\nsuggestion that there is little difference between sophisticated\nnon-cognitivism and cognitivism. Both speaker relativists and\nnon-cognitivists can say that the appropriateness of a moral judgment\ndepends on a speaker\u2019s attitudes. If the non-cognitivist\nsuggests that moral judgments predicate properties in a secondary way\n(perhaps to handle embedding), the cognitivist relativist can agree.\nAnd the theories can agree that the property predicated is determined\nas a function of the speaker\u2019s moral attitudes. Thus it may be\ndifficult to say precisely what the difference between the views is\n(Dreier 1999). However, the responses used to explain why\nnoncognitivism doesn\u2019t immediately entail relativism in section\n4.3 would also seem to show that the difficulty can be overcome.\n5.2 Minimalism as Undermining Non-cognitivism\n\nAnother line of argument with a similar upshot proceeds from\nminimalism of the sort we have already canvassed. Deflationism about\ntruth or truth-aptness can be used to argue that there is no room for\nnon-cognitivism of the sort that succeeds in vindicating much of moral\npractice. If there is no more robust understanding of truth conditions\nthan can be secured by minimalism about truth conditions, it will be\ndifficult for the quasi-realist non-cognitivist to make the\ndistinctive negative semantic claim \u2013 that moral judgements are\nnever true and not the kind of thing that can be true or false. Simple\nmoral sentences may be truth apt if all there is to having truth\nconditions is to meet minimal requirements of having a meaningful use,\nbeing in the right mood, and combining grammatically with other\nsentences to yield more complex embeddings. Furthermore, if the\nminimalist strategy extends to beliefs, so that all there is to being\na belief is to be a state of mind expressible by such minimally\ntruth\u2013apt sentences, moral judgements will be beliefs. The\nquasi-realist program to vindicate as much of ordinary moral practice\nmight thus endanger non-cognitivism when carried to this extreme.\nSuccess would leave us with no way to distinguish plausible\nnon-cognitivism from cognitivism.\n\nMore concretely, some semantic theorists have proposed that all that\nis needed to have minimal truth conditions is for a set of judgments\nto satisfy two constraints: (1) Sentences composed of the relevant\nexpressions must exhibit the syntactic surface features of\nparadigmatic truth-apt sentences such as those used to express\nordinary assertions, and they must embed grammatically in more complex\nsentences such as conditionals, propositional attitude ascriptions,\nand so on. (2) Use of these expressions must exhibit a certain amount\nof discipline so that there are clearly appropriate and inappropriate\nconditions for using them in sentences of the form noted in the first\ncondition (Boghossian 1990, Wright 1993; Divers and Miller 1994).\nNormative discourse seems to meet both of these constraints relatively\nstraightforwardly, and this may mean that moral sentences are\ntruth-apt and that some of them are true (Divers and Miller 1994).\n\nEarly critics of the collapse argument resisted on the basis of an\nalleged constitutive connection between truth-aptness and genuinely\ncognitive states. Such theorists regard it as a platitude about\nindicative sentences that they are conventionally apt for making\nassertions and that assertions express beliefs. If belief-expression\nis one of the criteria for truth-aptness, non-cognitivists will be in\na position to use psychological non-cognitivism as a reason to deny\nthat moral judgments are genuinely representational even when they\nmeet minimalist requirements (Jackson, Oppy, Smith 1994). So-called\nminimal truth conditions can remain part of the quasi-realist program\nonly so long as this is compatible with denying that moral judgements\nexpress beliefs.\n\nPartly in response to this move, minimalist defenders of the collapse\nargument have moved to the notion of minimal belief. They can say that\na state of mind is a belief and hence cognitive if and only if it is\none expressed by a sentence with truth conditions. Since minimalism\nsecures minimal truth conditions, indicative moral sentences have\ntruth conditions and the states they express are beliefs. Yet if the\nargument works, quasi-realist non-cognitivism would undermine its own\nright to employ both of the negative constitutive claims distinctive\nof non-cognitivism.\n\nMinimalist non-cognitivists have regrouped in various ways. One way is\nto resist the extension of the minimalist strategy to belief (Sinclair\n2007). Another is to distinguish minimal and robust notions of belief\nand representation. Minimal beliefs would need only to be states of\nmind expressed in assertions by indicative sentences, while robust\nbeliefs would meet some stronger requirement of representationality\n(Blackburn 2006). Non-cognitivism would then be committed to the view\nthat moral judgements did not express robust belief (Sinclair 2006;\nMcDonald 2012). The hope would be to contrast the entire minimalist\npackage with robust truth, robust truth-conditionality, and robust\nbelief. Such quasi-realist minimalists would be trying to find truth\nconditions which are (1) sufficient to make sense of using sentences\nhaving such truth-conditions in all of the ways that we use\nparadigmatically truth-apt sentences, and (2) which still fall short\nof robust representational truth conditions.\n\nOne might be a bit worried about the dialectic. If there are minimal\nand non-minimal readings of all the distinctive claims that can be\nused to distinguish cognitivism from non-cognitivism, we may lose our\ngrip on the distinction between the positions (Dreier, 2004b). Dreier\n(2018) suggests that the distinction between genuinely realist\ntheories (of which nonrelativist cognitivism is an instance) and\nanti-realist theories (of which noncognitivism and relativism are\ninstances) has to do with the order of explanation. According to\nanti-realist theories, entities or properties such as proposition,\nproperty, truth, truth conditions, and representation are explained by\nour use of terms for them in our thought and talk. Realists on the\nother hand think that our thought and talk is explained by these\nentities or properties. If this can be defended, we can distinguish\nminimalist and nonminimalist uses of the terms and ideas in question.\nThe distinction between cognitivists and noncognitivists can then be\nmade using the non-minimalist reading. But this may undercut the\nability of noncognitivists to use minimalism beyond making sense of\nseemingly realist linguistic constructions. For minimal propositions,\nproperties, and so on will likely not be suited to do much explanatory\nwork of the sort that robust propositions, properties, and so on are\nsuited for. The discussion continues. (Golub 2017, 2021; Simpson 2018,\n2020)\n\nIt is in any case controversial whether the minimalist proposal is\nviable, either for truth conditionality or for belief, let alone for\nfurther extensions beyond these (Dreier 2006; Dunaway 2010).\n5.3 Non-cognitivist Overreaching and Possible Collapse\n\nOne final sort of worry about the distinctiveness of non-cognitivism\nis worthy of mention. This worry is that if too many domains of\ndiscourse are such that they require non-cognitive analysis, the\ncontrast between cognitive and non-cognitive domains on which the view\ndepends will be hard to sustain. Blackburn, for example, suggests\nquasi-realist approaches not just to moral discourse, but also to\nmodality, causation and probability. One may wonder what he means to\ndeny about these domains that is not also applicable to the rest of\nour seemingly contentful judgments (Rosen 1998). Huw Price, along with\nvarious others, has argued for global expressivism. (Price and\nO\u2019Leary-Hawthorne 1996; Macarthur and Price 2007; Price 2013,\n2015) On such views the notion that any language is representational\nis called into question. This kind of collapse is in danger of\nassimilating the putatively cognitive and the putatively non-cognitive\nfrom the other direction \u2013 by making the former look more like\nthe latter, rather than the other way around as with the worries about\nminimalism. Even Blackburn himself on occasion expresses worries about\nthis problem (Blackburn 1993, 34), but more commonly he and other\nnon-cognitivists resist the worry by pointing to other domains of\ndiscourse which are not amenable to non-cognitivist analysis. Simpson\n(2020) argues that the most promising version of global expressivism\nshould be understood so as not to contradict local expressivism.\n6. Conclusion\n\nNon-cognitivism first came on the scene as a rather starkly drawn\nalternative to prevailing cognitivist and realist construals of moral\ndiscourse. As it developed to enable it to explain features of moral\ndiscourse relied on by its critics, the view became more subtle and\npresented a less stark contrast with realist positions. The main\nnegative claims were often somewhat moderated. For example, the claim\nthat moral judgments had no descriptive meaning evolved into a claim\nthat any such meanings were secondary. The claim that moral judgments\ncould not be true or false became the claim that they could be true or\nfalse only in a minimal or deflationary sense. Not all of the shifts\nhave been embraced by all non-cognitivists, but it is fair to say that\ncurrent versions are more complex and subtle than the theories from\nwhich they descend. As a result the arguments for and against the\nviews have gotten rather intricate and even technical.
