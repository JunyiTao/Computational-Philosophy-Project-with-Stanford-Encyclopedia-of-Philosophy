    "main_text": "Religion, Religious Experience and A Common Faith || Faith and God\n9.5 Religion as Social Intelligence\u2014a Common Faith\n\nAs a pragmatist, a meliorist, and a humane democrat, Dewey sought a\nway to harness the undeniable power of religion and religious\nexperience toward an end beneficial to all. Religion, he understood,\nprovides people with a story about the larger universe and how they\nfit within it. He knew it was not enough to criticize religion,\nbecause this leaves powerful human needs unmet. Dewey did not propose\nswapping out old religious institutions for new ones; he hoped,\nrather, that the emancipation of religious experience from\ninstitutional and ideological shackles might direct its energies\ntoward something like a \u201ccommon faith\u201d, a passion for\nimaginative intelligence pursuing moral goods. The methods of inquiry\nand criticism are not mysteries; they are deeply familiar already. The\nnecessary turn would come when religious persons realize that inquiry\ncould be extended to enhance religious experience and values\n(ACF, LW9: 23). If it could be appreciated how many\ncelebrated accomplishments were due not to God but to intelligent,\nhuman collaboration, then perhaps the idea of community could\ninspire a non-sectarian, common\n faith.[59]\n\nDewey\u2019s call for a common faith was, he thought, deeply\ndemocratic. Why? Because the idea of the supernatural was, by\ndefinition, suspicious of experience (as an adequate guide) and,\nconsequently, suspicious of empirical methods of inquiry. Unchecked by\nlived experience or experiment, supernaturalism can produce especially\ndeep divisions. The approach of Dewey\u2019s common faith is, in\ncontrast, intertwined with experimental inquiry\u2014drawing upon\nlived experience and constantly renewed through open communication.\nThis is why Dewey\u2019s exhortation to trade traditional religious\nfaith for a common faith in empirical intelligence is of a piece with\nhis experimental ideal of democracy.\n",
