    "main_text": "Distal Theories of Sounds || The Dispositional View\n3.3 The Dispositional View\n\nThere are yet other ways to construe sounds under the distal umbrella.\nAccording to dispositional account of sounds, \n\n\nsounds are dispositions of objects to vibrate in response to being\nstimulated. Sounds are perceived transiently, but they are not\nperceived as being transient and they are not in fact transient.\n(Kulvicki 2008: 2) \n\n\nThe account takes Pasnau\u2019s original insight that sounds be\nconsidered as akin to colors in their being located features of\nobjects. Indeed, Kulvicki draws a set of analogies between sounds and\ncolors based on the assumption that colors are dispositions to reflect\nlight in a certain manner. The analogies include the fact that as\ncolors exist in the dark (being dispositions) sounds exist in the\nvacuum, and that as light waves are a way to get knowledge of colors,\ncompression waves in a medium are a way to get knowledge of sounds. To\ncomplete the analogy, as \u201ccolors give off light when stimulated\nby light, objects in a medium give off compression waves when they are\nthwacked\u201d (2008: 4). More controversially, \u201cWithout\nvibrating, objects have sounds, but these sounds cannot be\nheard\u201d (2008: 4). Thwacking is the key element in the\ndispositional proposal. Thwacking reveals sounds. A good\nthwack (an impulse that contains all relevant frequencies) is\nconsidered to be to sounds what white light is to colors. White light\ncontains waves of all lengths in roughly the same proportion and thus\nsamples adequately the dispositions of the object to reflect some of\nthem. If you lit up a surface with a monochromatic laser beam at\n500nm, the disposition the surface may have to reflect light of 600nm\nwill not be revealed. A good thwack makes the object resonate at all\nfrequencies and thus reveals the vibratory modes of an object by\nstimulating it at the frequencies at which it responds better.\n\nThe impulse proposal solves an alleged disanalogy between color and\nsound, i.e., the absence of a normative analogue of white light in the\ncase of sounds (O\u2019Callaghan 2007). White light is normatively\nsignificant for revealing colors; a good impulse is normatively\nsignificant for revealing a sounding disposition.\n\nKulvicki\u2019s dispositional theory neatly accounts for some distal\nintuitions about sounds. (Other intuitions, such as the idea that\nsound have a loudness, are beyond the descriptive power of the theory,\nthat on that score considers loudness as a property not of the sound,\nbut of the thwack). In particular it highlights the importance of\naction in bringing about auditory information about an object: most\nobjects sound because we deliberately impart a thwack on them, and in\nmany cases in which we want to know how an object sounds, we do impart\nthe thwack, and subtly modulate it. When we hear a sound we get\nknowledge of a kind of resistance an object opposes to thwacking; it\nis knowledge of an elastic disposition. The account explains the fact\nthat the more the object reacts, the more it is sonorous. And an\nobject\u2014say, a guitar string\u2014is \u201cA sharp\u201d\nbecause at that frequency it responds optimally to thwacking.\n\nKulvicki\u2019s alleges that an analysis of the phenomenon of sound\nconstancy, modeled on an analogue to color constancy, militates in\nfavor of the dispositional view. Colors are notoriously resilient to\nmany changes of illumination, and even when incident light composition\nis very distant from standard light, surfaces may be seen as having\ntheir standard color. \u201cThe green grass looks green in the orange\nlight at dusk, but it looks like green grass illuminated oddly\u201d\n(Kulvicki 2008: 9). This is in sync with the likely function of\nvision\u2014to inform about distal, stable properties of surfaces.\nAnalogously, Kulvicki claims, \u201cobjects sound roughly the same\nwhether it is white noise [i.e., an impulse] or something reasonably\nfar from it that stimulates them\u201d (2008: 9). Our ability to\nrecognize voices across a large variation of ways to produce them is a\ncase in point. In general, humans are able to identify sounds in terms\nof their spectral slopes and spectral envelope patterns, which are\n\u201cfairly constant across changes in the fundamental frequency\nproduced by the vocal chords\u201d (2008: 10). Now, it can be\nobjected that voices are but a part of the auditory world, and they\nare the object of dedicated neural machinery. More generally, however,\nsound constancy is exhibited in hearing objects of various sorts. \n\n\nThere is no obvious reason the auditory system should exhibit\nconstancy for something like spectral slope or envelope pattern,\nunless the auditory system has the function of identifying stable\nproperties of objects. (2008: 10) \n\n\nFacts of auditory constancy thus help out the dispositional theory\ninsofar as the function of the auditory system is to find out whatever\nstable property of the environment is heard as being indeed\nconstant.\nObjections to the dispositional theory\n\nWe shall enlist two objections to the dispositional account.\n\nA first problem with the dispositional account is that of specifying\nwhat precisely the disposition in question is. An object\u2019s\ndisposition to vibrate at its natural frequencies does not exhaust the\npossibilities. \n\n\nWhen struck, an object vibrates in an odd but characteristic fashion\nfor a brief time before it settles into vibrating at its natural\nfrequencies, if it has any. Like natural frequencies, these attack\npatterns are relatively stable dispositions of objects to vibrate when\nthwacked. Similarly, objects\u2019 vibrations decay\ncharacteristically. Attacks and decays are stable dispositions of\nobjects to vibrate when thwacked, just as natural frequencies of\nvibration are. (Kulvicki 2008: 14)\n\n\nHence there are three dispositions (at least) here: a disposition to\nreact in the attack mode, a disposition to react in the decay mode, a\ndisposition to vibrate in a certain way. There are many more. For\ninstance, a disposition to respond by emitting a certain pattern of\nwaves when rubbed or when brushed; or when broken. Many are the\ndispositions, and the dispositional account should endorse the idea\nthat many are the (possibly unheard) sounds here. Call this the\nmany-disposition problem.\n\nNormativity half-solves the many-disposition problem. Some ways of\nimparting energy to an object are more telling than others. By\ncontrast, light is the sole \u201cthwacker\u201d for colors (modulo\ndifferences in intensity and light spectrum), but there are many\ntwhackers for eliciting the sonority of an object. The dispositional\ntheory of colors suffers from some variant of the many-disposition\nproblem. The color of many objects and stuff depends on their\ntemperature. At 1000 \u00b0C, iron glows. At \u221220 \u00b0C, water is\nwhite.\n\nA different problem for the dispositional theory is: What are those\nindividuals that we hear when the object sounds? The main problem a\ndispositional account of sounds has to face is that even if we accept\nthat sounds are sound dispositions, there appear prima facie to exist,\non top of those dispositions, the individual, occurrent\nsounds\u2014those that last when the disposition is realized. (A\nsimilar problem plagued Chisholm\u2019s account of events as\nrepeatable entities: as Davidson pointed out, any such account should\naccommodate the problem of assigning a status to the single\noccurrences of the repetitions, which cannot be themselves repeatable\nitems.) Indeed, as Kulvicki notes,\u201cnow and again one encounters\nobjects making sounds they do not have\u201d (2008: 8); he dismisses\nthese encounters as rather exceptional, but no matter their\nfrequency\u2014and radio listening provides a very common\nexample\u2014the \u201csound made\u201d, as distinct from the\n\u201csound had\u201d, must be accommodated by any theory of sounds.\nKulvicki addresses the problem in a general way, by distinguishing\nbetween sounds as dispositions and the hearings of sounds. There are\nno individual sounds, only episodes of hearing the dispositional\nsounds. We do hear sounds, these are the dispositions, but the\nimpression that sounds last depends on the fact that our hearing\nepisodes last.\n\nKulvicki denies that this account entails an error theory because he\nthinks that intuitions are not particularly telling about the\ndistinction between hearing as an individual event and hearing a\nsound. However, a threefold distinction should apply here. Grant the\ndispositional sound. Grant hearing episodes. Now, the duration of a\nhearing episode is different from the duration of an occurrent sound.\nYou set a tuning fork in motion. It vibrates for thirty seconds. But\nthen, after ten seconds, you get bored and block your ears with your\nhand. The duration of your hearing is ten seconds. But the sound is\nstill there, for another twenty seconds. Generally speaking, unheard\nsounds are accounted for in the dispositional theory only as\nunrealized dispositions. Occurrent unheard sounds are invisible to the\ndispositional account.\n\nKulvicki answers this objection by saying that this phenomenon is\nconsistent with the dispositional view (2014: 218). In order to have\nsounds, it is required that the dispositions of an object to vibrate\nin a certain way are realized, that these dispositions generate waves\nin a medium, and that ears can detect these waves. Occurrent unheard\nsounds produced when you block your ears and do not hear the tuning\nfork vibrating for thirty seconds are not a problem simply because\nthey are not sounds. For the dispositional view \u201csounds are not\noccurrent anythings: they are qualities\u201d (2014: 218). But the\nquestions that naturally arise and need to be answered are: if the\nunheard dispositions are not sounds, what are they? Moreover,\nimagining that when I am still blocking my ears with my hand, someone\nelse is there listening to the tuning fork, would she be listening to\nsounds? What are the items she would be listening to?\n\nAnother critical point of the dispositional view is that it does not\ntake into account the intuitive fact that sounds are heard as\nunfolding over time and as having a duration, which is a clear sign of\ntheir being an event. Kulvicki (2014: 211) discusses this by\nelaborating on the plausibility of the argument of \u201cperceptual\nseeming\u201d that he attributes to the people who claim that sounds\nare events. The argument is based on the commonsensical idea for which\nif sound appears to have a duration, it is because it\nactually has a duration. This argument rests on three\nassumptions: \n\n our experience of sounds can last a certain amount of time; \n we usually say we hear happenings, such as the slamming of a door\nor the falling of a tree, which we commonly refer to as\n\u201cevents\u201d; \n the events we hear have a duration that seems to coincide with\nthe duration of our experience of them. \n\n\nFor Kulvicki, even though the concurrence of these three assumptions\ndoes not imply that sounds have durations, the claim that sounds have\na duration is still the best explanation of the three\nuncontroversial claims. Therefore, even though, he does not propose a\nway to completely undermine this argument, he suggests a way to weaken\nit at least. The dispositional view can account for the third auditory\nintuition\u2014for which the time the events we hear take to occur is\noften coincident with the duration of the related auditory\nexperience\u2014emphasizing the role of mechanical stimulants. If we\nimagine the circumstance of a \u201clong-lasting, broad-spectrum\nmechanical stimulant\u201d (2014: 214) which thwacks the sounding\nobject in a stable vibratory disposition, it is not surprising that we\nhear events for about as long as we hear sounds. Kulvicki himself\nrecognizes that this is not a conclusive way of excluding that sounds\nhave durations, but yet it is a way of weakening this claim.\n\nRecently Kulvicki (2017: 91) has proposed a more inclusive view of\nwhat sounds are. He admits that identifying sounds with the mere\nvibratory dispositions of objects does not seem to capture the full\nrange of the auditory experience. Therefore, among sounds he includes\nalso aspects of events and the contexts in which those aspects are\nheard, and distinguishes between non-perspectival and perspectival\nqualities. The former are the dispositions of objects to vibrate in\nresponse to being mechanically stimulated but also happenings, and the\nsecond are \u201cabstractions over features of objects, events, and\nenvirons\u201d (2017: 87). Both qualities are taken to be sounds,\nwhich are a \u201cmongrel\u201d category. Kulvicki explains that the\nperspectival qualities are \u201cabstraction over intrinsic and\nrelational features of ordinary objects, environments, and range\nevents in which they participate\u201d (2017: 90). That is,\nconcerning some aspects things sound in a way and, concerning other\naspects, they sound differently, depending on the perspective. When we\nimitate the voice of someone, the reproduction of her voice is similar\nto the original in some respects but is different in others. Within\nKulvicki\u2019s view, the worry is that sounds seem to be different\nkinds of things, very distant and often in opposition with each other\n(features of objects but also happenings, perspectival properties but\nalso non-perspectival qualities). Rather than claiming that these are\ndifferent ways of characterizing sounds, Kulvicki is exhaustively\ntelling us the different things we can hear, without explaining in\nfull what sounds are.\n",
