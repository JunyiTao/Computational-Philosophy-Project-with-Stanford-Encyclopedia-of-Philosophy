    "main_text": "\n\n\u00c9tienne Bonnot, Abb\u00e9 de Condillac, was the chief\nexponent of a radically empiricist account of the workings of the mind\nthat has since come to be referred to as \u201csensationism.\u201d\nWhereas John Locke\u2019s empiricism followed upon a rejection of\ninnate principles and innate ideas, Condillac went further and\nrejected innate abilities as well. On his version of empiricism,\nexperience not only provides us with \u201cideas\u201d or the raw\nmaterials for knowledge, it also teaches us how to focus attention,\nremember, imagine, abstract, judge, and reason. It forms our desires\nand teaches us what to will. Moreover, it provides us with the best\nlessons in the performance of these operations, so that a study of how\nwe originally learn to perform them also tells us how those operations\nought to be performed. The pursuit of this tenet led Condillac to\narticulate an early developmental psychology, with explicit\npedagogical and methodological implications. His concerns also led him\nto focus on the theory of perception, and to advance important and\noriginal views on our perception of spatial form. He offered a more\nsearching, careful, and precise account of what exactly is given to us\nby each of the sense organs than any that had been offered up to his\nday, and presented a highly nuanced account of how this raw data is\nworked up into our beliefs about the world around us. \n",
