    "main_text": "Donor Matching and Selection || Motivations Underlying Donor Selection\n3.1 Motivations Underlying Donor Selection\n\nThree main categories of motivation underlie donor selection\ndecisions.\n\nThe first is selection against donors posing a threat to the physical\nwellbeing of pregnant women. This form of selection is ubiquitous such\nthat the barring of donors with sexually transmissible diseases such\nas HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis is mandated by national and\ninternational guidelines on gamete donation (see, for example HFE Act\n2008: s. T52 \u2013 see Other Internet Resources). This motivation\nfor selection is widely seen as morally unproblematic and will, for\nthis reason, be largely ignored here.\n\nThe second and third categories of motivation, termed here, selection\nfor \u2018matching\u2019 and selection for \u2018design\u2019 are,\nunlike the first, based on parental and/or societal preferences or\nvalues. In practice, most donor selection decisions will fall into\nboth categories, but a theoretical distinction is nonetheless made\nbetween the two in the philosophical literature.\n\nSelection for \u2018matching\u2019 is performed with the aim of\ncreating a child who bears a similarity to the recipient parents.\nThus, gamete donors are selected (or deselected) by reference to the\nextent to which their physical (and sometimes social and\npsychological) characteristics match those of recipient parents\n(Quiroga, 2017). As Braverman and Frith (2014) note, the aim of this\npractice is often:\n\n\nto enable secrecy and concealment of gamete donation. This practice\nincorporates a popular knowledge of genetics and enables the child to\n\u2018pass\u2019 as a naturally conceived child. This is an attempt\nto avoid overt \u2018difference\u2019 between child and couple and\nwhen a good match is achieved the donor disappears from view.\n(Braverman & Frith 2014: 135)\n\n\nThere may however, be aims other than secrecy and concealment. These\nmay have their basis in concerns regarding compatibility (wanting our\nchildren to be \u2018like us\u2019 and to \u2018fit in\u2019)\n(Ruddick 2000; Wong 2017), premised on physical or psychological\ndesire (we often choose our reproductive partners because they possess\ncharacteristics that please us), or even with the aim of avoiding\noffence \u2013 a member of a couple may be offended if his/her partner\nprefers a donor with characteristics markedly different from his/her\nown (Pennings 2000). Importantly, matching motivations are\ndistinguished from other motivations for selection as they are limited\nonly to desires to select for donors with characteristics possessed by\none/both intended social parents and should be based only in a desire\nto attain resemblance between parent and child.\n\nSelection motivated by design, however, is performed with the aim of\ncreating a child with characteristics which may or may not be\npossessed by the recipient parents but which are, nonetheless, deemed\nby them (and/or society) to be desirable (and often advantageous).\nSuch selection may thus be performed with several aims in mind. These\ninclude but are not limited to desires to increase the life prospects\nof one\u2019s children by preventing the birth of children with\ndisadvantageous or without advantageous characteristics, to satisfy\npreferences for a particular \u2018kind of child\u2019, or with the\neugenic aim of improving the gene pool through the selection of donors\ndeemed to possess \u2018superior\u2019 heritable traits.\n\nOf these two categories, a desire for matching is generally\nthought to be less morally problematic than a desire for\ndesign, since desires for familial resemblance, secrecy\n(within limits), and to avoid offence are often considered relatively\nbenign. This is not, however, to say that no critical work has been\ndone on this topic as shall be seen in\n subsection 3.3\n which looks to the question of whether race-based matching and\nselection practices are morally permissible.\n\nDesign-based motivations for selection, however, have been the subject\nof a great deal more debate. This discussion largely mirrors (or is\nsubsumed by) many of the discussions had regarding the ethics of\nselective reproductive technologies, such as pre-implantation and\npre-natal genetic diagnosis, and such topics as sex selection and\nhuman enhancement (see the entries on\n pregnancy, birth & medicine,\n and\n eugenics).\n For, although in the context of gamete donor selection there are no\nembryos or fetuses involved, nor genetic manipulation performed, there\nhas been much focus on questions of:\n\nWhether it might be obligatory for recipient parents and/or\nclinics to select against \u2018disadvantageous\u2019 genetic\ncharacteristics in their future offspring via donor selection.\nWhether selection for/against certain characteristics may be\nimpermissible on grounds that it explicitly or implicitly expresses\nmisinformed or \u2018ugly\u2019 and discriminatory attitudes towards\nexisting persons with \u2018deselected\u2019 characteristics.\nWhether the desire to influence children\u2019s genetic\nconstitutions through gamete donor selection represents troubling\nparental attitudes which may be contrary to common conceptions of the\ngood parent and parental virtues such as \u2018unconditional\nlove\u2019 and \u2018openness to the unbidden\u2019\n\n\nWith this in mind, throughout the following subsections such debates\nwill be explored in turn.\n",
