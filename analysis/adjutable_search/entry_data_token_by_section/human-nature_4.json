The Nature of the Evolutionary Unit Homo sapiens and its Specimens\n\nDetailing the features in virtue of which an organism is a specimen of\nthe species Homo sapiens is a purely biological task. Whether\nsuch specification is achievable and, if so how, is controversial. It\nis controversial for the same reasons for which it is controversial\nwhat conditions need to be met for an organism to be a specimen of any\nspecies. These reasons derive from the theory of evolution.\n\nA first step to understanding these reasons involves noting a further\nambiguity in the use of the expression \u201chuman nature\u201d,\nthis time an ambiguity specific to taxonomy. The term can be used to\npick out a set of properties as an answer to two different questions.\nThe first concerns the properties of some organism which make\nit the case that it belongs to the species Homo\nsapiens. The second concerns the properties in virtue of which a\npopulation or metapopulation is the species Homo\nsapiens. Correspondingly, \u201chuman nature\u201d can pick out\neither the properties of organisms that constitute their partaking in\nthe species Homo sapiens or the properties of some\nhigher-level entity that constitute it as that species. Human nature\nmight then either be the nature of the species or the nature of\nspecies specimens as specimens of the species.\n\nIt is evolution that confers on this distinction its particular form\nand importance. The variation among organismic traits, without which\nthere would be no evolution, has its decisive effects at the level of\npopulations. These are groups of organisms that in some way cohere at\na time in spite of the variation of traits among the component\norganisms. It is population-level groupings, taxa, not organisms, that\nevolve and it is taxa, such as species, that provide the organisms\nthat belong to them with genetic resources (Ghiselin 1987: 141). The\nspecies Homo sapiens appears to be a metapopulation that\ncoheres at least in part because of the gene flow between its\ncomponent organisms brought about by interbreeding (cf. Ereshefsky\n1991: 96ff.). Hence, according to evolutionary theory, Homo\nsapiens is plausibly a higher-level entity\u2014a unit of\nevolution\u2014consisting of the lower-level entities that are\nindividual human beings. The two questions phrased in terms of\n\u201chuman nature\u201d thus concern the conditions for\nindividuation of the population-level entity and the conditions under\nwhich organisms are components of that entity.\n",
