    "main_text": "Models of Brahman, God, and the Dao || Models of Brahman\n2.1 Models of Brahman\n\nThough the term \u201cHinduism\u201d and its variants was originally\na foreign imposition during the British Raj in India, they have become\nwidely used in the public realm to refer to forms of religiosity and\nspirituality that had their start in the Indus River valley at least\nsince 2000 BCE and have endured with great internal diversification\never\n since.[24]\n\nThe idea of Brahman was birthed in the Rig Veda (ca. 1000\u20131500\nBCE), was defined in the Upanishads (ca. 500 BCE), came to full flower\nin the Bhagavad-Gita (ca. 200 BCE) and the Brahmasutras (400\u2013450\nCE), and has been refined in commentaries about them for over the past\nmillennium, first by Adi Shankara (788\u2013820 BCE) and then by many\nothers after him which constitute the Vedanta system of Hindu\nphilosophy (Vedanta = \u201cend of the\n Vedas\u201d).[25]\n Vedanta has been dominant among the traditional six Hindu\nphilosophical systems for at least the last 500\n years.[26]\n\nAll the Vedanta schools agree on three things about Brahman, or\nultimacy (here is this entry\u2019s first, very general model of an\nultimate). First, Brahman\u2019s nature is essentially\nsat-chid-ananda, \u201cExistence-Consciousness-Bliss\u201d,\nwhich means that the metaphysical rock bottom of reality\nis\u2014surprise, given the phenomenal mess\u2014a blissful\nconsciousness. Second, most of the schools take Brahman to be what\nJeffery D. Long calls a \u201ctheocosm\u201d: (1) God and (2) a\ncosmos, meaning a universe/multiverse of all natural\n forms.[27]\n The original Sanskrit in the Vedantic texts is conceptually precise\nand better than what we have in the God-world relations in\n Section 1.5\n because there is a name for God and the world put together: the\ntheocosm gets called \u201cBrahman\u201d, God is\n\u201cIshvara\u201d (or \u201cNarayana\u201d or\n\u201cKrishna\u201d etc.), and the cosmos is \u201csamsara\u201d,\nand the whole thing and each part are\n eternal.[28]\n Third, the Vedanta schools all agree that their view about Brahman is\nassociated with (1) an epistemological license in direct experience,\neither in texts heard by spiritual adepts (sruti) or in\nproponents\u2019 own firsthand spiritual experience (for much more,\nsee Phillips 2019), and (2) a life expression that lives out such\nexperience and the view so deeply that it is hard to know which came\nfirst, the life expression or the metaphysical commitments that enable\nit.[29]\n\nWhat the Vedanta schools disagree about is the kind of link between\nGod and the cosmos in the theocosm. These disagreements spread them\nout in a range.\n\nOn one end is the Dvaita (dvaita = \u201ctwo\u201d) Vedanta\nschool, which is dualistic in its ultimate-world relation and\nnot far from the classical monotheistic views (model 2 in this entry).\nIt reads the theocosm to be two really distinct things, viz., God and\nthe cosmos, with no organic link between them. Though there is no\ncreation ex nihilo in Dvaita or any other Vedanta school,\nIshvara (God) is the Divine creator and sustainer of the distinct\ncosmos and ensouls it and resides within it. The ultimate is the two\neternally co-existing, like an eternal dweller eternally content to\nlive in an eternal house It built out of something other than Itself.\nOf the four traditional Hindu yogas, Dvaita is a deeply\nbhakti-oriented system (bhakti = \u201cdevotion\u201d),\ngenerally practicing devotion to Vishnu/Krishna.\n\nOn the other end of the range is the Advaita Vedanta school\n(advaita = not two) which is well-known in the West but not\nas dominant in India. It reads the theocosm/Brahman as one/non-dual,\nand takes God and the cosmos not to be really distinct, i.e., God =\nthe cosmos. The paradigmatic filling out of this view, often and\nperhaps mistakenly attributed to Shankara, is pantheistic and\n world-denying.[30]\n Specifically (here is model 3), such classical Advaitans hold that\nsince reality is one and the cosmos is many, the cosmos cannot be\nreal. It looks as if there is a cosmos filled with many\nthings, but the cosmos is merely an appearance (maya), and\ntaking it to be reality is like taking a rope at dusk to be a snake\n(Shankara\u2019s famous metaphor, see, e.g., Tapasyananda 1990: 34).\nWith the cosmos out of the picture, the theocosm is just the\n\u201ctheo\u201d part; to use the metaphor above, the\nultimate is all dweller, no house. That move makes the terms\n\u201cBrahman\u201d and \u201cGod\u201d interchangeable, and on\nit, God-Brahman is generally read as impersonal. The epistemological\nlicense in direct experience for this view is samadhi, a\nstate of spiritual absorption in which all dualities vanish and one\nexperiences just infinite bliss. Since the classical Advaitan view\ndenies the world, Anantanand Rambachan, a contemporary Advaitan, takes\nits best life expression to be that of the renunciant\n(sannyasi) who lives out that denial (2006: 69).\n\nIn the middle range between Dvaita and Advaita are a dozen subtly\ndistinct schools of mainstream Vedanta, often called the \u201cBhakti\nschools\u201d given their emphasis on devotion (the distinctions\nbetween them make a dozen distinct models here). These schools are all\npanentheistic and world-affirming. Their best representative\nis Ramanuja (ca. 1017\u20131157), the first comprehensive critic of\nShankara, who synthesized Advaita with bhakti in a system called\nVishishtadvaita (meaning \u201cnon-duality of the qualified\nwhole\u201d, model 4 for this\n entry).[31]\n Like classical Advaitans, Ramanuja takes the theocosm/Brahman to be\nnon-dual because it is all God, but unlike them, he takes the cosmos\nand the many things within it to be real and distinct from Brahman.\nHow can the ultimate be one but have parts? Ramanuja\u2019s\npanentheistic answer: the cosmic parts form an\n\u201cinseparable and integral union\u201d (aprthaksiddhi)\nwith Brahman, like the union of body and soul (sarira and\nsariri): Brahman is the cosmos\u2019 soul, and the cosmos is\nBrahman\u2019s body\u2014a body which, to use Ramanuja\u2019s\nillustration from a quote from the Upanishads,\n\n\n\u201cis born in, sustained by, and is dissolved in\nBrahman\u201d\u2026.[just] as pearls strung on a thread\u2026are\nheld as a unity without impairing their manifoldness. (Tapasyananda\n1990: 6)\n\n\nSo for Ramanuja, Brahman builds a house not out of something else as\nin Dvaita but out of Brahmanself, and eternally dwells in this eternal\nBrahman-house which (here is the mark of panentheism) depends on\nBrahman for its existence but not vice versa, i.e., (Brahman \u2192\nthe cosmos) but not (the cosmos \u2192 Brahman). Ramanuja also takes\nBrahman to be not impersonal but the Divine Person, known under\ndifferent sacred names, e.g., \u201cVishnu\u201d,\n\u201cNarayana\u201d, \u201cIsvara\u201d, etc. The moves to a real\ncosmos and divine personality have Ramanuja deciding that\nBrahman\u2019s essential nature as sat-chid-ananda is filled\nout with countless extrinsic \u201causpicious properties\u201d\n(\u201cqualities manifested in him in relation to finite\nbeings\u201d), among them some of the classical perfections such as\nomnipotence, omniscience and immutability, as well as compassion,\ngenerosity, lordship, creative power, and splendor (1990:\n36\u201337).The experiential epistemological licenses for\nVishishtadvaita are the combination of samadhi (which\njustifies the non-dual piece) and darsan (visual contact with\nthe divine through the eyes of images, which justifies the\nqualification to non-duality). Its best life expression is the\npractice of bhakti yoga, supported by the reality and personality of\nboth devotee and devoted in Ramanuja\u2019s metaphysics, and\nexemplified by the Alvars\u2019 passionate devotion to Vishnu from\nthe second to eighth century CE (Tapasyananda 1990: 33).\n\nIn the midst of this centuries-long dispute between the Dvaitans,\nAdvaitans and Bhakti schools, a key modern figure arose: Ramakrishna\n(1836\u201386), sometimes called \u201cthe Great Reconciler\u201d\nbecause he attempted to integrate all the schools into one\npluralistic, non-sectarian approach. His major insight (birthing model\n5 for this entry) is that \u201cGod is infinite, and the paths to God\nare infinite\u201d, and the schools are among these infinite paths\n(Maharaj 2018: frontispiece). Ramakrishna came by this view firsthand\nwhen, after being in a state of samadhi for six months, which\nhe said was \u201clike reaching the roof of a house by leaving the\nsteps\n behind\u201d,[32]\n he had a divine command to come down and stay in a state he called\n\u201cvijn\u0303a\u0304na\u201d (intimate knowledge),\nduring which he could see the roof but also see that \u201cthe steps\nare made of the same material as the roof (brick, lime, brick\ndust)\u201d. In other words, in vijn\u0303a\u0304na he saw\nthat Brahman is both non-dual and dual, and thus began to\naffirm the \u201cspiritual core\u201d of both schools, and\neventually of all the Hindu schools and Christian and Muslim ones, too\n(Long 2020: 166). He decided they all must be contacting different\n\u201caspects\u201d of one and the same reality, and that this\nreality thus must be deeply, indeed infinitely complex in order to\nmake such diverse experiences possible (Maharaj 2018: Chapter 1, part\n3, tenets 1 and 3; see also interpretive principle 4 and\n K422/G423).[33]\n Because he affirms the core of all schools, Ramakrishna is hard to\nclassify, but his view is probably best read as panentheistic and\nworld-affirming since he says over and over again that \u201call is\nBrahman\u201d and that Brahman \u201chas become everything\u201d,\ni.e., Brahman \u2192 the cosmos but not vice versa (Long 2020,\nespecially 163).\n\nContemporary Vedanta is alive and well. To offer just three examples:\nLong recently merged Ramakrishna\u2019s thought with\nWhitehead\u2019s to develop a Hindu process theology that offers an\nultimate unity behind the God-world relations that was missing in both\nWhitehead\u2019s and Griffin and Cobb\u2019s interpretations (see\n Section 2.2\n and Long 2013, our model 6). Ayon Maharaj has systematized\nRamakrishna\u2019s thought (no small task!) and put it into\nconversation with major Western philosophers to advance global\nphilosophical work on the problem of evil, religious pluralism and\nmystical experience (2018). Finally, Rambachan, a present-day\nAdvaitan, moves Advaita closer to Vishishtadvaita when he asserts that\n\u201cnot-two is not one\u201d (2015): non-dualism is not\npantheistic but rather panentheistic because Brahman is the\ncosmos\u2019 material and efficient\n cause;[34]\n Brahman intentionally self-multiplies to make the\n cosmos.[35]\n The cosmos is thus not maya but rather a finite\n\u201ccelebrative expression of Brahman\u2019s fullness\u201d\n(Rambachan 2006: 79). This reading (model 7 here) opens up Advaitic\ntheology to help heal a variety of human problems from low self-esteem\nto the caste system because there is real power in re-seeing people as\ninfinite-conscious-bliss, so worthy of respect (Rambachan 2015).\n\nMuch of the explicit discussion among the schools is debate over\nmetaphysical ultimacy in general and over the Brahman-God-cosmos\nrelation in particular. Still, there is an implicit drumbeat in all\nthe schools that one can find ultimate fulfillment in Brahman, whether\nthat is in a state of samadhi, vijn\u0303a\u0304na\nor devotion (e.g., the \u201cprofound and mutual sharing in the life\nof God\u2026creates unsurpassed bliss [for the devotee]\u201d, Long\n2013: 364). So Brahman seems to be soteriologically as well as\nmetaphysically ultimate. What is less clear is whether Brahman is\naxiologically ultimate, especially in the moral category of being.\nThere are suggestive phrases sprinkled through the texts in the\naffirmative, but as Alan Watts says:\n\n\nreason and the moral sense rebel at pantheistic monism which must\nreduce all things to a flat uniformity and assert that even the most\ndiabolical things are precisely God, thus destroying all values.\n(Hartshorne & Reese 1953 [2000: 325], quoting Watts 1947)\n\n\nThough this sentiment is softened by the panentheistic readings in\nseveral of the schools since the world can take the fall, in the end,\nall the schools affirm that Brahman is everything, in some sense. And\nif Brahman is everything, and not everything seems to be good, then\nBrahman seems not to be good, at least not full stop. There is no\nquestion that Brahman is still the ultimate in Vedantic schools even\nif Brahman is not axiologically ultimate; as indicated at the start,\nmetaphysical and soteriological ultimacy are sufficient for ultimacy\nwhen nothing else in a system has all three marks. But it is jarring\nand a real contribution to global thought about ultimacy to consider\ndropping axiological ultimacy from the trio: what is most deeply real\nmay not be all good, though contact with it may still manage to\nfulfill us deeply all the same.\n",
