    "main_text": "Other Model-theoretic Games || Forcing games\n7.1 Forcing games\n\nForcing games are also known to descriptive set theorists as\nBanach-Mazur games; see the references by Kechris or Oxtoby\nbelow for more details of the mathematical background. Model theorists\nuse them as a way of building infinite structures with controlled\nproperties. In the simplest case \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\) play a\nso-called Model Existence Game, where \\(\\exists\\) claims that a fixed\nsentence \\(\\phi\\) has a model while \\(\\forall\\) claims that he can\nderive a contradiction from \\(\\phi\\). In the beginning a countably\ninfinite set \\(C\\) of new constant symbols \\(a_0, a_1, a_2\\) etc is\nfixed. \\(\\exists\\) defends a disjunction by choosing one disjunct, and\nan existential statement by choosing a constant from \\(C\\) as a\nwitness. \\(\\forall\\) can challenge a conjunction by choosing either\nconjunct, and a universal statement by choosing an arbitrary witness\nfrom \\(C\\). \\(\\exists\\) wins if no contradicting atomic sentences are\nplayed. \\(\\exists\\) has a winning strategy (a Consistency Property is\none way of describing a winning strategy) if and only if \\(\\phi\\) has\na model. On the other hand, if \\(\\forall\\) has a winning strategy, the\ntree (which can be made finite) of all plays against his winning\nstrategy is related to a Gentzen style proof of the negation of\n\\(\\phi\\). This method of analysing sentences is closely related to\nBeth\u2019s method of semantic tableaux and the Dialogical Game (see\nSection 8).\n\nTo sketch the idea of the general Forcing Game, imagine that a\ncountably infinite team of builders are building a house \\(A\\). Each\nbuilder has his or her own task to carry out: for example to install a\nbath or to wallpaper the entrance hall. Each builder has infinitely\nmany chances to enter the site and add some finite amount of material\nto the house; these slots for the builders are interleaved so that the\nwhole process takes place in a sequence of steps counted by the\nnatural numbers. \n\nTo show that the house can be built to order, we need to show that\neach builder separately can carry out his or her appointed task,\nregardless of what the other builders do. So we imagine each builder\nas player \\(\\exists\\) in a game where all the other players are lumped\ntogether as \\(\\forall\\), and we aim to prove that \\(\\exists\\) has a\nwinning strategy for this game. When we have proved this for each\nbuilder separately, we can imagine them going to work, each with their\nown winning strategy. They all win their respective games and the\nresult is one beautiful house.\n\nMore technically, the elements of the structure \\(A\\) are fixed in\nadvance, say as \\(a_0, a_1, a_2\\) etc., but the properties of these\nelements have to be settled by the play. Each player moves by throwing\nin a set of atomic or negated atomic statements about the elements,\nsubject only to the condition that the set consisting of all the\nstatements thrown in so far must be consistent with a fixed set of\naxioms written down before the game. (So throwing in a negated atomic\nsentence \\(\\neg \\phi\\) has the effect of preventing any player from\nadding \\(\\phi\\) at a later stage.) At the end of the joint play, the\nset of atomic sentences thrown in has a canonical model, and this is\nthe structure \\(A\\); there are ways of ensuring that it is a model of\nthe fixed set of axioms. A possible property P of \\(A\\) is said to be\nenforceable if a builder who is given the task of making P\ntrue of \\(A\\) has a winning strategy. A central point (due essentially\nto Ehrenfeucht) is that the conjunction of a countably infinite set of\nenforceable properties is again enforceable.\n\nVarious L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorems of model theory can be proved\nusing variants of the Forcing Game. In these variants we do not\nconstruct a model but a submodel of a given model. We start with a big\nmodel \\(M\\) for a sentence (or a countable set of sentences) \\(\\phi\\).\nThen we list the subformulas of \\(\\phi\\) and each player has a\nsubformula with a free variable to attend to. The player\u2019s task\nis to make sure that as soon as the parameters of the subformula occur\nin the game, and there is a witness to the truth of the formula in the\nbig model, one such a witness is played. When the game is over, a\ncountable submodel of \\(M\\) has been built in such a way that it\nsatisfies \\(\\phi\\).\n\nThe name \u2018forcing\u2019 comes from an application of related\nideas by Paul Cohen to construct models of set theory in the early\n1960s. Abraham Robinson adapted it to make a general method for\nbuilding countable structures, and Martin Ziegler introduced the game\nsetting. Later Robin Hirsch and Ian Hodkinson used related games to\nsettle some old questions about relation algebras.\n\nForcing games are a healthy example to bear in mind when thinking\nabout the Dawkins question. They remind us that in logical games it\nneed not be helpful to think of the players as opposing each\nother.\n",
