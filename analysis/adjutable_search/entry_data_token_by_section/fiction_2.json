    "main_text": "The Nature of Fiction || Fiction as Making Up Stories\n1.2 Fiction as Making Up Stories\n\nA more promising approach to understanding the fiction/non-fiction\ndistinction focuses not on semantic notions or stylistic features, but\non the author\u2019s inventiveness in producing a text, whatever its\nsemantic or stylistic character. The best known such account is Harry\nDeutsch\u2019s \u201cfiction as making up stories\u201d (Deutsch\n2000, 2013). Deutsch insists \u201cwe cannot be left without a sharp\ndistinction between fact and fiction\u201d (2000: 149) even if we\nthink, as Goodman did, that facts are themselves fabricated. Crucial\nto the notion of fiction, he thinks, is that, unlike fact, it is the\nproduct of creative, imaginative activity on the author\u2019s part,\nactivity in which the author makes something up \u201cout of whole\ncloth\u201d. His own distinctive take on this view explains the kind\nof fabrication involved in fiction-making as the author\u2019s\nstipulatively ascribing properties to individuals, but where these\nproperties match properties possessed by pre-existing objects from the\n\u201cfictional plenitude\u201d, a domain that contains not only\nevery conceivable object and event but also an enormous range of\nimpossibilities (Deutsch 2000: 155\u20136). \n\nDeutsch is particularly critical of a contrasting view, to be\ndiscussed later, according to which what is necessary and sufficient\nfor a work to be a work of fiction is specified in terms of\nimaginative activity on the part of the work\u2019s readers rather\nthan its author (Deutsch 2013: 366ff). But focusing on the author\nseems to have its own problems. First, it suggests that works like\nCooke\u2019s \u201cJimmy\u2019s World\u201d and James Frey\u2019s\nA Million Little Pieces (2003), both of which were\nsubstantially made up although passed off as works of non-fiction,\nthereby count as works of fiction, contrary to the usual\nclassification of such works (see Friend 2012; Friend agrees that we\nmight pejoratively call A Million Little Pieces\n\u201cjust one long fiction\u201d, but sees this as an example of\nthe ambiguity of the word \u201cfiction\u201d). In response, Deutsch\ninsists that, whatever our judgment about Frey\u2019s A Million\nLittle Pieces, the case of Cooke is clear: \n\n\n[she] exercised her authorial imagination. She did everything an\nauthor of fiction would normally do. \u2026 If there ever was a case\nof fiction masquerading as fact, this is it. (Deutsch 2013: 369) \n\n\nA second point, to be discussed below, is that numerous works of\nnon-fiction involve creative interpolations on the part of the author.\nIf so, Deutsch\u2019s approach faces the danger that all such works\nshould be classified as part fiction, part non-fiction. But Deutsch\ndenies that on such a \u201cfiction as making up stories\u201d\napproach the inclusion of salient fictitious elements is sufficient to\nmake something a work of fiction (2013: 368)\u2014it all depends on\nthe level of imaginative activity exhibited by the work.\n",
