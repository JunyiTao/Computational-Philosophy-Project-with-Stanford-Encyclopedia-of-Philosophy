The\nexisting studies can be sub-classified into studies concerning\nAktionsart simpliciter and those concerned with shifts from\none aspectual class to an other, i.e., aspectual coercion. In\nthe following, we will provide a brief overview of both areas of\nresearch. \n\nMcKoon and Macfarland (2002) were among the first to study processing\nconsequences of decompositional analyses along the lines of Dowty\n(1979). They provided evidence from reading times and lexical decision\ntimes that accomplishments \\((\\alpha\\) CAUSE \\(x\\) BECOME IN-STATE)\nare inherently more complex than achievements \\((x\\) BECOME\nIN-STATE). Similarly, Gennari and Poeppel (2003) compared eventive\npredicates (which included accomplishments, achievements and\nactivities) to statives and found that the former were more complex to\nprocess than the latter. Brennan and Pylkk\u00e4nen (2010) extended\nthis line of research to psychological verbs and compared\naccomplishments (e.g., scare) with statives (e.g.,\n\ncherish) using reading time methods and\nmagnetoencephalography (MEG). They also included a comparison of the\nsimple psychological statives with modified sentences that required\ncoercion (e.g., within half an hour, the child cherished the\nprecious kitten). Reading times and MEG data indicated that\naccomplishments were more complex to comprehend than statives and,\nmoreover, that the enhanced semantic complexity led to different MEG\ncomponents than aspectual coercion. Finally, Coll-Florit and Gennari\n(2011) compared durative states and punctual event predicates (mostly\nachievements) and observed longer reading times of statives than of\nevent predicates. They attributed this effect\u2014which runs counter\nto what would be expected under a decomposition analysis\u2014to the\nfact that durative situations occur in semantically more diverse\ncontexts and elicit more diverse associations than event predicates\nwhich may modulate the required processing effort. Taken together, the\nexisting studies provide evidence for complexity differences between\nthe aspectual classes, lending support to decompositional analyses.\nHowever, not all issues are entirely solved yet and further research\nis required. \n\nThe second line of research concerns aspectual coercion. Here, the\nmain research question has been whether aspectual coercion is a costly\noperation. Existing research has almost exclusively focused on one\ncoercion type, i.e., coercion of point action verbs into an iterative\ninterpretation (but see Brennan and Pylkk\u00e4nen 2010 and Bott 2010\nfor exceptions). Again, the findings are mixed. Early studies have\nprovided evidence for coercion costs employing secondary tasks such as\ncross-modal lexical decision or stop making sense\njudgments (Pi\u00f1ango, Zurif, and Jackendoff 1999; Todorova\net al. 2000). Pickering et al. (2006) used the same materials as in\nthe experiments mentioned above, but tested a coerced meaning during\nordinary reading without an additional task. In two self-paced reading\nand two eyetracking experiments, they found aspectual coercion to be\nno more difficult than their aspectual control conditions. This lack\nof effect let them propose the aspectual underspecification\nhypothesis, stating that the aspectual representation stays\nunderspecified during normal reading. Brennan and Pylkk\u00e4nen\n(2008) challenged this view and reported a coercion effect of coercion\nsentences like (57a) as compared to aspectual controls (57b) both in\nself-paced reading and in MEG; on the basis of a rating study they had\ncarefully selected clear instances of point action verbs. Their MEG\nstudy revealed activation in the anterior midline field, a MEG\ncomponent that has been observed for other non-aspectual cases of\ncoercion, too. \n57.\n\n(a)\n\nThroughout the day, the student sneezed in the back of the classroom. \n      \n\n\n(b)\n\nAfter twenty minutes, the student sneezed in the back of the classroom.\n      \n\n\nComplicating matters, Bott (2008, 2010) applied the same norming\nprocedures, but did not find evidence of coercion cost in iterative\npoint action verbs in German. With other types of aspectual coercion,\nhowever, there were clear indications of processing difficulty\nindicating that the underlying processes differ between coercion\ntypes. Furthermore, the study provided evidence that at least in some\ncases (achievement \u21dd accomplishment) coercion operations are not\ntriggered by an aspectual mismatch, but can proceed smoothly by\nenriching the aspectual representation with additional eventualities.\nThis was shown in an event-related potentials (ERP) study in which a\ndouble dissociation of ERP components was elicited by sentences with\naspectual coercion as compared to sentences that contained an\naspectual mismatch.\n",
