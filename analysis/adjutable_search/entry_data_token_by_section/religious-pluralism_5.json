    "main_text": "Religious Diversity and Religious Tolerance\n6. Religious Diversity and Religious Tolerance\n\nReligious intolerance, defined as the practice of keeping others from\nacting in accordance with their religious beliefs, is not new.\nHowever, there is concern world-wide over the increasing amount, and\nincreasingly violent nature, of such behavior. Accordingly, there is\nunderstandably a renewed interest in fostering religiously tolerant\nenvironments in which individuals with differing religious\nperspectives can practice their faiths unencumbered.\n\nA number of philosophers have turned their attention to the\nrelationship between religious diversity and religious tolerance, with\nthe main focus on whether acknowledgement of, and subsequent\nreflection on, religious diversity might lead to greater religious\ntolerance. The main argument supporting the claim that acknowledged\ndiversity can foster tolerance was proposed by Philip Quinn (Quinn\n2001, 57\u201380; 2002, 533\u2013537; 2005a, 136\u2013139). He\nmaintained that (1) serious reflection on the undeniable reality of\nreligious diversity will necessarily weaken people\u2019s\njustification for believing that their religious perspective is\nsuperior to the perspectives of others and that (2) this weakened\njustification can, and hopefully will for some, lead to greater\nreligious tolerance\u2014for example, will lead to a more accepting,\nless confrontational attitude toward others.\n\nBoth of Quinn\u2019s contentions have been challenged. The claim that\nreflection on the acknowledged reality of religious diversity reduces\nindividuals\u2019 justified confidence in the superiority of their\nposition has been subject to at least two types of criticism. As noted\nearlier in our discussion of religious diversity and epistemic\nobligation (section 3), some philosophers agree with Alvin Plantinga\nthat the proponents of a given religious perspective need not grant\nthat their competitors are actually on an equal epistemic footing and\nare thus justified in continuing to maintain that their perspective is\nsuperior without further reflection (Plantinga 1997, 296). \n\nOther philosophers do not deny that proponents of differing religious\nperspectives are on an equal epistemic footing or that reflection on\nthese diverse perspectives might in some cases actually cause\nindividuals to become less certain that their perspective is superior.\nThey do deny, however, that there is any necessary epistemic\nconnection between acknowledged diversity and a weakening of justified\npersonal commitment. That is, they argue, proponents of a given\nreligious perspective can acknowledge both that (1) those holding\nperspectives differing from their own are epistemic peers and that (2)\nthey are not in a position to demonstrate objectively that their\nposition is superior and yet can justifiably continue to maintain that\n(3) their perspective is, in fact, superior (Hasker 2008).\n\nQuinn\u2019s second contention\u2014that weakened justification in the\nsuperiority of a perspective has the promising potential for fostering\nreligious tolerance\u2014has also been challenged. For instance,\nWilliam Lane Craig, Robert McKim, and Keith Yandell have all argued\nthat if individuals weaken their conviction that the specific\nteachings of their religion are correct, including the relevant moral\nteachings that prohibit intolerance, it might in turn actually make it\nmore likely that they will engage in intolerant behavior as it may\nwell deflate the very confidence in the relevant beliefs needed for\ninspiring tolerance (Craig 2008; McKim 2008; Yandell 2008).\n\nOthers, such as William Hasker, have questioned whether Quinn\u2019s\nchallenge to those who hold firmly to the superiority of their\nreligious perspectives\u2014that the reality of religious diversity\nrequires that they hold their perspectives less firmly\u2014will have\nthe effect Quinn intended. It was his hope that those challenged in\nthis fashion would \u201csoften\u201d their exclusivistic\nconvictions and thus be less likely to engage in intolerant behavior.\nBut might not just the opposite occur? Might not those told that the\nreality of religious diversity reduces their justified confidence in\ntheir beliefs feel threatened and thus, in an attempt to \u201cstand\nup for the truths\u201d they still firmly believe, become even more\nintolerant of those with other perspectives (Hasker 2008)?\n\nThose sympathetic to Quinn\u2019s position do not deny that some who find\nthe justification for their religious beliefs challenged might for\nthat reason find themselves with a weaker basis for refraining from\nintolerant behavior or become even more intolerant in defense of the\nbeliefs they continue to hold firmly. But those sympathetic to\nQuinn\u2019s \u201cpathway from diversity to tolerance\u201d maintain that\nacknowledged religious diversity can, and often does, foster in\nindividuals (1) greater respect for their epistemic competitors and\ntheir positions and (2) a more flexible, inclusive understanding of\ntheir own position. And those who respect their competitors and have a\nmore inclusive understanding of their own perspectives, they add, are\nless likely to engage in inappropriate intolerant religious behavior\n(Basinger 2008; Dormandy 2020).\n",
