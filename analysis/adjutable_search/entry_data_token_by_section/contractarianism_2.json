    "main_text": "Answering the Moral Skeptic\n3. Answering the Moral Skeptic\n\nA brief sketch of the most complete and influential contemporary\ncontractarian theory, David Gauthier\u2019s, is in\norder. Gauthier\u2019s project in Morals By Agreement is to\nemploy a contractarian approach to grounding morality in rationality\nin order to defeat the moral skeptic. (However, Anita Superson (2009)\npoints out that Gauthier attempts to answer only the skeptic who asks\n\u201cwhy should I be moral?\u201d but leaves both the motive\nskeptic, who argues that it is enough to act morally but need not be\nmotivated by morality, and the amoralist, who denies that there is any\nsuch thing as morality, that is, that there are true moral\nstatements.)  It is generally assumed that humans can have no perfect\nnatural harmony of interests (otherwise morality would be largely\nsuperfluous), and that there is much for each individual to gain\nthrough cooperation. However, moral constraint on the pursuit of\nindividual self-interest is required because cooperative activities\nalmost inevitably lead to a prisoner\u2019s dilemma: a situation in\nwhich the best individual outcomes can be had by those who cheat on\nthe agreement while the others keep their part of the bargain. This\nleads to the socially and individually sub-optimal outcome wherein\neach can expect to be cheated by the other. But by disposing\nthemselves to act according to the requirements of morality whenever\nothers are also so disposed, they can gain each others\u2019 trust\nand cooperate successfully.\n\n\nThe contractarian element of the theory comes in the derivation of the\nmoral norms. The compliance problem\u2014the problem of justifying\nrational compliance with the norms that have been accepted\u2014must\ndrive the justification of the initial situation and the conduct of\nthe contracting situation. It is helpful to think of the contract\nsituation as a bargain, in which each party is trying to negotiate the\nmoral rules that will allow them to realize optimal utility, and this\nhas led philosophers to apply a number of bargaining solutions to the\ninitial contract situation. Gauthier\u2019s solution is the \u201cminimax\nrelative concession\u201d (1986, ch. V). The idea of minimax relative\nconcession is that each bargainer will be most concerned with the\nconcessions that she makes from her ideal outcome relative to the\nconcessions that others make. If she sees her concessions as\nreasonable relative to the others, considering that she wants to\nensure as much for herself as she can while securing agreement (and\nthereby avoiding the zero-point: no share of the cooperative surplus)\nand subsequent compliance from the others, then she will agree to it.\nWhat would then be the reasonable outcome? The reasonable outcome,\naccording to this view, is the outcome that minimizes the maximum\nrelative concessions of each party to the bargain (Gauthier 1986, ch.\nV).\n\nIn a more recent article and in contrast to his previous view,\nGauthier rejects the idea that the problem of grounding morality in\nrationality should be framed as a bargaining problem at all\n(2013). When the problem is framed in this way, the solution depends\non assuming that the parties participating in the contract\nnegotiations are all rational maximizers. Under his revised view,\nhowever, he neither sees the problem as a bargaining problem nor the\nparties as (constrained) rational maximizers; instead, he conceives of\nthem as Pareto-optimizers. As Pareto-optimizers or rational\ncooperators, the parties seek to produce a Pareto-optimal outcome,\nwhich is an outcome where it is not possible to increase the payoff to\none party without decreasing the payoff to another party. If it is\npossible to move to another outcome to increase the payoff accruing to\none party without decreasing the payoff to another party, then the\ncurrent outcome is not Pareto-optimal. It is important to note that\nthis change is not meant to attach additional motives to the parties\nin addition to the motive of self-interest. Rational cooperation,\naccording to Gauthier, provides an alternative conception of what\nconstitutes rational action. Rational cooperators do not want to leave\nthe additional benefits of cooperation on the table.  How do these\nchanges solve the original problem of grounding morality in (this\nconception of) rationality? The answer is to calculate the payoffs for\neach outcome in terms of cooperative benefits or the absence of\ncooperative benefits. For example, the cooperative minimum is a payoff\nwhich provides one party with none of benefits generated through\ncooperation. In contrast, the cooperative maximum is the payoff which\naffords a single party all of the possible benefits generated through\ncooperation. The potential cooperative gain is the difference between\nthese two. The actual cooperative gain is then the difference between\nits payoff and the party\u2019s cooperative minimum. Next, the actual\ncooperative gain is then to be divided by the party\u2019s potential\ncooperative gain. This generates the party\u2019s proportionate gain,\nwhich shows the actual gain as a proportion of the party\u2019s\npotential gain from cooperation. Each outcome is then represented as a\nproportionate gain from cooperation. Finally, the goal is to select\nthat outcome generating the maximum minimum proportionate gain to any\nsingle party. This principle, which Gauthier calls maximin\nproportionate gain, selects a Pareto-optimal outcome that would be\nrational for parties to select.\n\n\nEqually important to the solution as the procedure is the starting\npoint from which the parties begin. For some contractarians (like\nGauthier) there is no veil of ignorance\u2014each party to the\ncontract is fully informed of their personal attributes and holdings.\nHowever, without the veil of ignorance, contractors will be aware of\nthe differences in bargaining power that could potentially affect the\noutcome of the bargain. It is important, then, that the initial\nposition must have been arrived at non-coercively if compliance to the\nagreement is to be secured. A form of the \u201cLockean\nproviso\u201d (modeled after Locke\u2019s description of the initial\nsituation of his social contract): that one cannot have bettered\nhimself by worsening others, may turn out to be beneficial in cases\nwithout a veil of ignorance. In sum, the moral norms that rational\ncontractors will adopt (and comply with) are those norms that would be\nreached by the contractors beginning from a position each has attained\nthrough her own actions which have not worsened anyone else, and\nadopting as their principle for agreement the rule of minimax relative\nconcession (Gauthier 1986, ch. VII).\n\nOn one line of thought, contractarianism produces liberal individuals\nwho seem well suited to join the kind of society that Rawls envisioned\n(Gauthier 1986, ch. XI). On another line, the Hobbesian contractarian\nargument leads towards the sparse government of libertarianism\n(Narveson 1988). The controversy here turns on the primary motivation\nfor individuals to make agreements and cooperate. As we said before,\nthere are two such motivations for the Hobbesian contractarian: fear\nof the depredations of others and benefits from cooperation with\nothers. Libertarianism results when the first of these is primary,\nwhereas when the second is primary, the kind of reciprocity and\nsupportive government that will be discussed in the final section\nbecomes possible.\n",
