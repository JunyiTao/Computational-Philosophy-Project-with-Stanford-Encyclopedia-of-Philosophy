    "main_text": "Metaethics and Experimental Moral Philosophy || Moral Disagreement\n4.2 Moral Disagreement\n\nAs we saw at the beginning of this entry, some of the earliest\nthinking in empirically-informed moral philosophy concerns moral\ndisagreement. Brandt and Ladd conducted in-depth investigations into\nthe moral codes of other groups, and some contemporary moral\nphilosophers have argued for continuing attention to the empirical\ndetails of moral disagreement. This is partly due to the influence of\nMackie\u2019s (1977: 36\u201337) formulation of what he dubbed\n\u2018the argument from relativity\u2019 in terms of an inference to\nthe best explanation: the best explanation of the nature and\npersistence of moral diversity, Mackie argues, is that our moral\njudgments represent \u201cways of life,\u201d rather than\n\u201cperceptions, most of them seriously inadequate and badly\ndistorted, of objective moral values.\u201d Realists have tended to\nrespond to the argument by pointing to other possible explanations of\ndisagreement that are consistent with objectivity, such as mistakes\nabout the non-moral facts, irrationality, and failures of impartiality\nand imagination (e.g., Brink 1984; Sturgeon 1988; Smith\n1994; Shafer-Landau 2003; for an overview and analysis of realist\nresponses, see Loeb 1998).\n\nHere it is useful to recall Brandt\u2019s admonition that \u201cbare\ninformation about intercultural differences\u201d will not suffice to\nsettle the debate. Because the argument from disagreement turns, in\npart, on both the existence of moral disagreement and the best\nexplanation for it, evaluating the prospects for the argument requires\nattention to the empirical details of actual moral disagreements,\nrather than conjecture about the outcomes of possible moral\ndisagreements. For example, Doris and Plakias (2008) discuss several\ninstances of cross-cultural moral disagreement, and assess the\nprospects for applying what they call \u2018defusing\nexplanations\u2019 to these cases. A defusing explanation is one that\naccounts for the disagreement in terms of a non-moral difference or an\nepistemic shortcoming on the part of one or more disputant, thereby\nshowing that it is not, in fact, a moral disagreement. Their argument\nand the experiments they cite are discussed in detail in the entry on\nempirical moral psychology, so we will not discuss them in detail\nhere; for now, we will note that such explanations are difficult to\nassess via survey methods alone. This is why it is especially helpful\nto look to the anthropological record, as Oliver Curry et al. (2019)\ndo in a recent publication. Curry hypothesizes that morality comprises\nstable, cooperative solutions to recurrent problems that can be\nmodeled as non-zero-sum games. There are a variety of such recurrent\nproblems, and game theory has established a suite of analytical tools\nfor diagnosing and solving them. Curry and his colleagues show that\nsuch solutions are always seen as either morally good or\nmorally neutral in societies at various stages of development, from\nsmall-band hunter gatherers to industrialized democracies. This\nresearch suggests that philosophers may have greatly exaggerated the\nextent of moral disagreement that actually exists.\n",
