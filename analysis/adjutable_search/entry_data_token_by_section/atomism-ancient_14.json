    "main_text": "The Legacy of Ancient Atomism || Ancient Greek Atomism in Later European Philosophy\n3.3 Early Modern Indian Atomism\n\nThe philosophical traditions discussed above continued for over a\nmillenium in the Indian schools, without the historical discontinuity\ncaused in Europe and West Asia by the collapse of the Roman Empire and\nthe rise of Islam. The debate between \u2018idealist\u2019 and\n\u2018realist\u2019 metaphysics continued, the latter represented by\nthe Navya-Ny\u0101ya school which developed about the fourteenth\ncentury, building on the work of Udayana and G\u00e1nge\u1e63a\n(Phillips 1995). Stephen Phillips argues that the \u2018New\nLogic\u2019 thought of Navya-Ny\u0101ya school proliferated in Indian\nculture and law as well as impacting other philosophical schools,\nespecially after 1500 CE. Although it incorporated\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika realism, the focus was on epistemology and on\ncognitive experience rather than on the atomist metaphysics.\n\nJonardon Ganeri (2011) has argued for regarding the early modern\nperiod in India as a period of innovation comparable to that in\nEurope, although the Indian intellectual world was less concerned to\npresent itself as a radical break from the past than was true of the\nEuropean \u2018New Science.\u2019 Fran\u00e7ois Bernier, protege\nof the French atomist Pierre Gassendi, travelled to India in 1656 and\nfound a receptive audience in the Sanskrit scholars trained in the\natomism of the classical period of Indian philosophy (Ganeri 2011).\nJayar\u0101ma, an early modern Indian atomist working in the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika tradition, produced an atomist theory that Ganeri\nargues is closer to that of Daniel Sennert than to that of Gassendi\n(Ganeri 2011, p. 218). Substantial concessions are made within this\natomist metaphysics towards acknowledging the reality of emergent\nproperties.\n",
