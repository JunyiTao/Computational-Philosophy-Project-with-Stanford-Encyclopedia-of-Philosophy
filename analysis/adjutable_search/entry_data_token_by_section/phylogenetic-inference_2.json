    "main_text": "Phylogenetic Inference and Philosophy\n2. Phylogenetic Inference and Philosophy\n\nSection 1\n served as an introduction to the history and problem of phylogenetic\ninference. In this section, we will look at how phylogenetics and\nphilosophy are intertwined\u2014in particular, we will examine some\nfoundational debates in phylogenetics that have a distinctly\nphilosophical flavor, and we will point out more traditional\nphilosophical questions that the study of phylogenetics can shed light\non.\n\nAt its core, phylogenetic inference is about evaluating competing\nhypotheses. In an important sense, phylogeneticists are faced with\nwhat philosophers of science would identify as a problem of\n underdetermination of theory by evidence\n.\nMultiple competing phylogenetic trees can explain the same data,\nthough in conflicting ways; it is the phylogeneticists task to\nidentify which of those hypotheses best explains those data. It will\nbe useful to separate the problem into two parts:\n\nidentifying what the evidence is; and\nconstructing a phylogeny to explain the evidence we have.\n\n\nIn the case of phylogenetic inference, we are in the philosophically\ninteresting and puzzling situation where it seems that these two\nquestions cannot really be separated.\n",
