    "main_text": "Means and Ends || Practical Judgment is Creative\n3.2 Practical Judgment is Creative\n\nThe preceding considerations show that practical judgment is creative:\nit institutes new ends-in-view, new desires. Against Dewey\u2019s\nclaim of creativity, it might be objected that Dewey\u2019s theory of\npractical reasoning still presupposes certain values. In the ditch\ncase, the original end would not have been rejected but for the\nagent\u2019s fear of injury. Dewey agrees that \u201cjudgment at\nsome point runs against the brute act of holding something dear as its\nlimit\u201d (LJP 46). Without some prizings that are not themselves\nsubject to appraisal at the time of deliberation, there is nothing to\nguide practical reasoning. Yet these very prizings may be subject to\nappraisal at some other time, perhaps even as a consequence of acting\non them on this occasion.\n\nOne might still object that this is not enough to show that practical\njudgment is genuinely creative. Perhaps it just takes given prizings\nand determines the end through some kind of vector addition, taking\ntheir weights as given. If a man is out to buy a suit, for instance,\nhe approaches the problem with a given set of habitual priorities\n\u2014 for example, that durability and cheapness are more important\nthan style. The man\u2019s choice of suit thus merely reflects the\nweights of the man\u2019s already given priorities. But if this were\nall there was to choice, then deliberation would hardly be necessary.\nHe would simply inspect the prized qualities of the available suits,\nand let impulse determine his choice from there. In fact, Dewey\nargued, deliberation assigns weights to different prized\nqualities in the context of choice, rather than taking them as given.\nWe can\u2019t really tell how much weight to put on this or that\nprized quality until we see it instantiated in combination with the\nother qualities in the set of alternatives, and consider further how\nthe suit with its qualities will function as a means in the future.\nAlthough the man may be used to prizing durability in a cheap suit,\nand placing little weight on style, this suit is to be used for job\ninterviews, which are expected to land him a much higher paying job.\nThis use of the suit gives him several reasons to alter the habitual\nweights he assigns to suit qualities. Anticipating that he will soon\ncome to prize style more, once he is able to afford it, he may decide\nto borrow against the future and go for the expensive stylish suit\nnow, so that he will still prize it after he lands the job. Or he may\ndecide that he needs to make an especially good impression in order to\nland the job, so that he must weight style more heavily than cheapness\nnow. Or he may decide that he\u2019ll only need to use this suit\nonce, to get a job, and after that his tastes will change\ncommensurately with his income, but in ways he can\u2019t know ahead\nof time. Hence, he should not count durability as an important value\nhere. Evaluation remains creative even granting that it presupposes\ncertain prizings, because it is still up to us to assign weights to\nprized qualities in light of the novel features of the context. Prior\nweightings cannot determine current ones, since the former may be\nmaladapted to the new situation (LJP 30\u20135; VEK 10\u201320).\n",
