    "main_text": "Phenomenological Approaches to Technology || Original Technicity and the Human Being\n2.2 Original Technicity and the Human Being\n\nBernard Stiegler is mostly known for his multi-volume work\nTechnics and Time (La technique et le temps). In this\nmulti-volume work he argues that the human and the technical are\nco-original\u2014in other words that the technical did not emerge out\nof the (already constituted) human or the human out of the (already\nconstituted) technical but that these two ontological domains\nco-constituted each other from the very start. To make his argument he\ndraws on the work of Heidegger and Derrida but also very significantly\non the work of the paleoanthropologist Andre Leroi-Gourhan\u2014in\nparticular his widely recognized Gesture and Speech\n(originally published in French in 1964). In this work Leroi-Gourhan\nargues that there is a fundamental continuity from the biological to\nthe sociological and that this continuity is realized through the\nmediation of technology. He sees the use of tools (made possible by\nthe freeing of the hands when in the upright position) as a process of\n\u2018exteriorization\u2019 in which the process of evolution is\ntransferred from the zoological domain to the technical\ndomain\u2014or as Stiegler suggests \u201cthe continuation of life\nby means other than life\u201d (1998, 50). Thus, unlike other\nmammals, humans remain generalists who specialize\u2014as and when\nrequired\u2014by exteriorizing these specialized capabilities in the\ntechnical domain outside of the human body. This exteriorization is\nalso simultaneously reflected (or mirrored) back as a process of\ninteriorization where the technologies become embodied by the humans\nwho use them. Stiegler uses the notion of\n\u2018epiphylogenesis\u2019 to describe this extra-genetic\nco-evolution of the human and the technical. Through epiphylogenesis\nculture becomes possible as the \u2018the inorganic organization of\nmemory\u2019 (1998, 174, my emphasis). Thus, for him\n\u201c[t]he human invents himself in the technical by inventing the\ntool\u2014by becoming exteriorized technologically\u201d (1998,\n141). Moreover, Stiegler suggests that without these technically\ninscribed memory systems we would not be able to exist in\ntime. Without the material technicity we humans would be unable to\nexperience the past and would have nothing to \u2018select\u2019\nfrom in order to invent the future. Thus, without technicity (what he\ncalls \u201corganized inorganic matter\u201d) we will exist in a\nperpetual present without any hope of transcending it. This point is\nindeed also made by Latour (2005) in his discussion of technology as\nmediators. As such culture and society will not be possible. Thus, for\nStiegler the constitutive transcendental horizon of the human is\ntechnicity, from which emerges the conditions of possibility of time,\nsociety and culture.\n\nIf the claims made by Stiegler are correct then this fundamental unity\nbetween the human and the technical (as expressed through the idea of\nepiphylogenesis) have important implications for how we think about\nour relationship with technology. It is not just something \u2018out\nthere\u2019 it is also immediately something \u2018in here\u2019,\nat the very source of our humanity. This means that when we design new\ntechnological systems we are also designing the sort of humans that we\nare (or will become). We are adding to the archive that will afford\nfuture generations their possibilities for being and also\nsimultaneously framing the way our human past will be recalled and\nremembered. This co-evolution of the human and the technical also\nmeans that we cannot escape the technical--our being is always already\ntechnical. It is not something alien that we can get rid of, or choose\nto be without. Within this perspective technology becomes the central\nquestion in which many of the most fundamental questions of what it\nmeans to be human becomes opened up in new and unexpected ways (this\nis why Stiegler argues that technicity is the central philosophical\nquestion which has been forgotten ever since the Greeks). \n\nThe radical nature of Stiegler\u2019s project means that there are\nmany who disagree with him. For example Vaccari (2009) argues that the\nfundamental genetic concepts of \u2018inscription\u2019 and\n\u2018transmission\u2019 at the centre of Stiegler\u2019s argument\nhave been severely criticized (especially in the biological sciences\nwhere it originates). He also suggests that there is a certain\ndeterminism at the heart of Stiegler\u2019s programme, which has been\nseverely criticized by many constructivists such as Latour. \n",
