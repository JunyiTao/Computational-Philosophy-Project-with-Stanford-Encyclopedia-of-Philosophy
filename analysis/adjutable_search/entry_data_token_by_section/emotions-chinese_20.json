    "main_text": "Emotions in Early Chinese Philosophical Texts || The Laozi (Dao De Jing)\n5.5 The Laozi (Dao De Jing)\n\nThe Laozi (\uf934\u5b50), also known as Dao De\nJing (\u9053\u5fb7\u7d93, The Book of Dao and De),\nis a Daoist text in the Warring States period. Laozi (Lao-tzu or Lao\nDan) is believed to be its single author although many scholars today\nbelieve that it is a composite work by several authors and/or\neditors. In the\nLaozi, the term qing is not found. There is no\ndiscussion of particular natures and dispositions of human beings\nunder a single term such as qing (\u60c5) or xing\n(\u6027). However, individual emotions or affective states such as anger\n(nu \u6012), resentment (yuan \u6028) courage\n(yong \u52c7), loving kindness (ci \u6148) and desire\n(yu \u6b32) are discussed in the Laozi. Laozi believes\nthat emotions have lasting influence on human behavior and destructive\nemotions can threaten the wellbeing of people and damage their\nharmonious social interactions. Although he does not discuss seriously\nwhether emotions are genuine or superficial or whether they change or\ntransform the inner states of the mind as Mencius or Xunzi does, he\ndiscusses how emotions affect behaviors of people and motivate them to\nhelp or harm themselves and others.\n\nHe states that\n\n\nI have three treasures that I hold on to and preserve:\n\nThe first I call loving kindness [ci \u6148];\n\nThe second I call frugality [jian \u5109];\n\nThe third I call never daring to put oneself first in the world.\n\nThe kind can be courageous [yong \u52c7];\n\nThe frugal can be generous;\n\nThose who never dare to put themselves first in the world can become\nleaders of the various officials.\n\nNow to be courageous without frugality,\n\nTo put oneself first without putting oneself behind others,\n\nThese will lead to death. (Laozi, 67; Ivanhoe 2002:\n70)\n\n\nIn this passage, Laozi mentions loving kindness, frugality and not\nbeing self-interested or self-centered as the three treasures and\nexplains how they influence the success and failure of people. Among\nthem, loving kindness and courage are affective dispositions that help\nindividuals to be successful leaders but lacking them would lead to\nfailure and death.\n\nFollowing the same line of thinking, he explains that emotions can\nhelp or harm people depending on their circumstances. Like rain helps\npeople when the land is dry but harms people when the river is\nflooding, emotions should be carefully aroused and expressed. He\nstates that \n\n\nTo be courageous in daring leads to death, To be courageous in not\ndaring leads to life. These two bring benefit to some and loss to\nothers. (Laozi, 73, Ivanhoe 2002: 76) \n\n\nLaozi also warns us about harmful or destructive emotions. Some of\nthese are negative emotions, emotions that have negative valence such\nas anger and resentment. Laozi suggests that one should carefully deal\nwith anger and resentment. He states that one should \u201crepay\nresentment with Virtue [de \u5fb7]\u201d (Laozi, 63;\nIvanhoe 2002: 66) and \u201cThose good at attack are never enraged\n[nu \u6012]\u201d (Laozi, 68; Ivanhoe 2002: 71).\nSpecifically, he talks about confrontational or contentious attitudes\nand dispositions: they are antagonistic or hostile toward others and\ntheir interest by focusing exclusively on one\u2019s own interest. He\nstates that \n\n\nThose good at conquering their enemies never confront them. Those good\nat using others put themselves in a lower position. This is called the\nVirtue of noncontention. (Laozi, 68; Ivanhoe 2002: 71)\n\n\nOne of the frequently discussed emotions in the Laozi is\ndesire (yu \u6b32). Desire, specifically a natural tendency\nto satisfy one\u2019s basic needs, is not necessarily negative or\nevil but Laozi mentions it 26 times in this relatively short text and\ncarefully explain its potentially harmful effects because of its\nexclusive nature (its selfish or self-centered orientation that\nexcludes or disregards others\u2019 interests or viewpoints). Laozi\nstates that \u201cthe great Way [\u5927\u9053] is always without\ndesires [\u6b32]\u201d (Laozi, 34) and \u201cthose who\npreserve the Way [\u9053], do not desire [\u6b32]\nfullness\u201d. (Laozi, 16).  He emphasizes that one should\nminimize one\u2019s desire (Laozi, 1, 19) to understand and\nfollow the Way (dao). Vir\u00e1g characterizes\nLaozi\u2019s rather cautionary and reproving approach to emotions,\nspecifically desire, as one of the salient features of\nthe Laozi. She (Vir\u00e1g 2017: 76) states that\n\n\n\nOne of the salient features of this text [the Laozi] is its\nnegative account of emotions and desires as fundamentally contrary to\nthe realization of the perfected life\u2014a life in accordance with\nthe natural process of the cosmos.\n\n\nLaozi\u2019s reproving approach to desire, however, should be\ncarefully understood since he does not say that one should simply\nreject or suppress one\u2019s desire. In the first chapter of the\nLaozi, he makes a paradoxical statement about desire and\ndesirelessness in their relations to the ultimate Way:\n\n\nA Way that can be followed is not a constant Way.\n\nA name that can be named is not a constant Way.\n\nNameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and earth.\n\nNamed, it is the mother of the myriad creatures.\n\nAnd so,\n\nAlways eliminate desires in order to observe its [Way\u2019s]\nmysteries;\n\nAlways have desires in order to observe its [Way\u2019s]\nmanifestations.\n\n(Laozi, 1; Ivanhoe 2002: 1).\n\n\nLaozi, as he does in many chapters of the Laozi, presents an\nintriguing paradox of desire and desirelessness in this passage. The\npassage can be interpreted in many different ways. From a contextual\nviewpoint, desire (yu) can be beneficial or harmful, or\ncultivated or eliminated as courage (yong) can be beneficial\nor deadly in certain situations to certain people (Laozi,\n73). From a psychological viewpoint, certain aspects of desire (such\nas exclusive promotion of self-interest, sensual indulgence, or\nself-centered viewpoint) is harmful but others (such as a natural\ninclination to satisfy one\u2019s basic needs) are acceptable.\nHowever, considering the significance of this chapter, i.e., the\nbeginning chapter of the Laozi where the ultimate Way and the\nlinguistic or conceptual limitation of properly identifying and\ndescribing it are discussed, the paradox of desire and desirelessness\ncan be understood from the viewpoint of the intriguing relation\nbetween desire and the Way. The relation between the two can be\nexplained in two opposite ways: desire may distort the Way (in this\ncase, desirelessness is needed) but it helps us to initiate our\njourney toward the Way (in this case, desire is needed). These\nconflicting approaches to desire show both the limitation and the\nopenness of desire in our journey to understand the Way. Perhaps the\nrelation between the Way and desire can be characterized as a form of\naffective intentionality where emotions open up, guide, and change our\nemotional projection to the world and the Way. Regardless of these\ninterpretations of desire, it is clear that Laozi\u2019s view is not\nsimply ascetic and eliminative toward desire, even though he cautions\nagainst its potentially harmful and destructive nature, specifically\nthe exclusive pursuit of self-interest and self-centered viewpoint\nthat can generate the confrontational, narrow-minded and myopic\nunderstanding of the self and others.\n\nOverall, the Laozi develops a stimulating view on the nature\nof emotions and affective dispositions. It provides a seemingly\nnegative but cautiously practical and ingenuously encouraging\ndiscussion of how emotions affect people. Some emotions, specifically\nanger and desire, can be harmful and destructive in certain contexts,\nnot just because of their negative valance but because of the\nexclusive and self-oriented viewpoints. In addition, the\nLaozi focuses on how emotions interact with other emotions,\nhow they affect behaviors, and how they contribute to the wellbeing of\npeople and the stability of their communities.\n",
