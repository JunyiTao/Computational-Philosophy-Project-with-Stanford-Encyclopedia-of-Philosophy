    "main_text": "The Basic Norm\n1. The Basic Norm\n\n\nThe main challenge for a theory of law, as Kelsen saw it, is to\nprovide an explanation of legality and the normativity of law, without\nan attempt to reduce jurisprudence, or \u201clegal science\u201d, to\nother domains. The law, Kelsen maintained, is basically a scheme of\ninterpretation. Its reality, or objectivity, resides in the sphere of\nmeaning; we attach a legal-normative meaning to certain actions and\nevents in the world (PT1, 10). Suppose, for example, that a new law is\nenacted by the California legislature. How is it done? Presumably, some\npeople gather in a hall, debate the issue, eventually raise their hands\nin response to the question of whether they approve a certain document\nor not, count the number of people who say \u201cyes\u201d, and then\npromulgate a string of words, etc. Now, of course, the actions and\nevents described here are not the law. To say that the description is\nof the enactment of a new law is to interpret these actions and events\nin a certain way. But then, of course, the question is why\ncertain acts or events have such a legal meaning and others\ndon\u2019t?\n\n\nKelsen\u2019s answer to this question is surprisingly simple: an\nact or an event gains its legal-normative meaning by another legal norm\nthat confers this normative meaning on it. An act can create or modify\nthe law if it is created in accordance with another,\n\u201chigher\u201d legal norm that authorizes its creation in that\nway. And the \u201chigher\u201d legal norm, in turn, is legally valid\nif and only if it has been created in accord with yet another,\n\u201chigher\u201d norm that authorizes its enactment in that\nway. In other words: it is the law in the United States that the\nCalifornia legislature can enact certain types of laws. But what makes\nthis the law? The California Constitution confers this power on the\nstate legislature to enact laws within certain prescribed boundaries of\ncontent and jurisdiction. But then what makes the California\nConstitution legally valid? The answer is that the legal validity of\nthe Constitution of California derives from an authorization granted by\nthe US Constitution. What makes the US Constitution legally valid?\nSurely, not the fact that the US Constitution proclaims itself to be\n\u201cthe supreme law of the land\u201d. Any document can say that,\nbut only the particular document of the US Constitution is actually the\nsupreme law in the United States.\n\n\nThe problem is that here the chain of authorization comes to an end:\nThere isn\u2019t a higher legal norm that authorizes the enactment of\nthe (original) US Constitution. At this point, Kelsen famously argued,\none must presuppose the legal validity of the Constitution. At some\nstage, in every legal system, we get to an authorizing norm that has\nnot been authorized by any other legal norm, and thus it has to be\npresupposed to be legally valid. The normative content of this\npresupposition is what Kelsen has called the basic norm. The basic norm\nis the content of the presupposition of the legal validity of the\n(first, historical) constitution of the relevant legal system (GT,\n110\u2013111).\n\n\n As Kelsen saw it,\nthere is simply no alternative. More precisely, any alternative would\nviolate David Hume\u2019s injunction against deriving an\n\u201cought\u201d from an \u201cis\u201d. Hume famously argued that\nany practical argument that concludes with some prescriptive statement,\na statement of the kind that one ought to do this or that, would have\nto contain at least one prescriptive statement in its premises. If all\nthe premises of an argument are descriptive, telling us what this or\nthat is the case, then there is no prescriptive conclusion that can\nlogically follow. Kelsen took this argument very seriously. He observed\nthat the actions and events that constitute, say, the enactment of a\nlaw, are all within the sphere of what \u201cis\u201d the case, they\nare all within the sphere of actions and events that take place in the\nworld. The law, or legal norms, are within the sphere of\n\u201cought\u201d, they are norms that purport to guide conduct.\nThus, to get an \u201cought\u201d type of conclusion from a set of\n\u201cis\u201d premises, one must point to some \u201cought\u201d\npremise in the background, an \u201cought\u201d that confers the\nnormative meaning on the relevant type of \u201cis\u201d. Since the\nactual, legal, chain of validity comes to an end, we inevitably reach a\npoint where the \u201cought\u201d has to be presupposed, and this is\nthe presupposition of the basic norm.\n\n\n The idea of the\nbasic norm serves three theoretical functions in Kelsen\u2019s theory\nof law: The first is to ground a non-reductive explanation of legal\nvalidity. The second function is to ground a non-reductive explanation\nof the normativity of law. The third function is to explain the\nsystematic nature of legal norms. These three issues are not\nun-related.\n\n\nKelsen rightly noticed that legal norms necessarily come in systems.\nThere are no free-floating legal norms. If, for example, somebody\nsuggests that \u201cthe law requires a will to be attested by two\nwitnesses\u201d, one should always wonder which legal system is talked\nabout; is it US law, Canadian law, German law, or the law in some other\nlegal system? Furthermore, legal systems are themselves organized in a\nhierarchical structure, manifesting a great deal of complexity but also\na certain systematic unity. We talk about Canadian law, or German law,\netc., not only because these are separate countries in which there is\nlaw. They are also separate legal systems, manifesting a certain\ncohesion and unity. This systematic unity Kelsen meant to capture by\nthe following two postulates:\n\nEvery two norms that ultimately derive their validity from one\nbasic norm belong to the same legal system.\nAll legal norms of a given legal system ultimately derive their\nvalidity from one basic norm.\n\n\n\nWhether these two postulates are actually true is a contentious\nissue. Joseph Raz argued that they are both inaccurate, at best.  Two\nnorms can derive their validity from the same basic norm, but fail to\nbelong to the same system as, for example, in case of an orderly\nsecession whereby a new legal system is created by the legal\nauthorization of another. Nor is it necessarily true that all the\nlegally valid norms of a given system derive their validity from the\nsame basic norm (Raz 1979, 127\u2013129).\n\n\nBe this as it may, even if Kelsen erred about the details of the unity\nof legal systems, his main insight remains true, and quite\nimportant. It is true that law is essentially systematic, and it is\nalso true that the idea of legal validity and law\u2019s systematic nature\nare very closely linked. Norms are legally valid within a given\nsystem, they have to form part of a system of norms that is in force\nin a given place and time.\n\n\nThis last point brings us to another observation that is central to\nKelsen\u2019s theory, about the relations between legal validity and, what\nhe called, \u201cefficacy\u201d. The latter is a term of art in\nKelsen\u2019s writings: A norm is efficacious if it is actually (generally)\nfollowed by the relevant population. Thus, \u201ca norm is considered\nto be legally valid\u201d, Kelsen wrote, \u201con the condition that\nit belongs to a system of norms, to an order which, on the whole, is\nefficacious\u201d (GT, 42). So the relationship here is this:\nefficacy is not a condition of legal validity of individual norms. Any\ngiven norm can be legally valid even if nobody follows it. (e.g. think\nabout a new law, just enacted; it is legally valid even if nobody has\nyet had an opportunity to comply with it.) However, a norm can only be\nlegally valid if it belongs to a system, a legal order, that is by and\nlarge actually practiced by a certain population. And thus the idea of\nlegal validity, as Kelsen admits, is closely tied to this reality of a\nsocial practice; a legal system exists, as it were, only as a social\nreality, a reality that consists in the fact that people actually\nfollow certain norms.\n\n\nWhat about the basic norm, is efficacy a condition of its validity?\nOne might have thought that Kelsen would have opted for a negative\nanswer here. After all, the basic norm is a presupposition that is\nlogically required to render the validity of law intelligible. This\nwould seem to be the whole point of an anti-reductionist explanation\nof legal validity: since we cannot derive an \u201cought\u201d from\nan \u201cis\u201d, some \u201cought\u201d must be presupposed in\nthe background that would enable us to interpret certain acts or\nevents as having legal significance. Kelsen, however, quite explicitly\nadmits that efficacy is a condition of the validity of the basic norm:\nA basic norm is legally valid if and only if it is actually followed\nin a given population. In fact, as we shall see below, Kelsen had no\nchoice here. And this is precisely why at least one crucial aspect of\nhis anti-reductionism becomes questionable.\n",
