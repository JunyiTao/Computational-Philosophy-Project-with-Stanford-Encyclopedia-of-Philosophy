    "main_text": "Ethics\n9. Ethics\n\nGrice uses this general account of reasoning to investigate moral\nreasoning and moral reasons. He emphasizes the connections between\nreasons, actions, and freedom. It is convenient to divide\nGrice\u2019s approach into two stages (although he himself does not\ndo so). The first stage argues that one must regard the exercise of\nrationality in the free adoption and pursuit of ends as an\nunrelativized good at which all persons should aim. The second stage\nexamines the concepts of happiness and freedom to discover principles\nwhich persons\u2014conceived of as rationally adopting and pursuing\nends\u2014must adopt insofar as they are to qualify as rational.\n\nThe first stage. Why think that one must regard the exercise\nof rationality in the free adoption and pursuit of ends as an\nunrelativized good at which all persons should aim? To begin with,\nwhat does Grice mean by an \u201cunrelativized good\u201d? Grice\ngrants that the concept of unrelativized value requires defense; after\nall, things have value only relative to ends and beneficiaries. So how\nis unrelativized value to be understood? Grice defines unrelativized\nvalue \u201cin Aristotelian style [as] whatever would seem to possess\nsuch value in the eyes of a duly accredited judge; and a duly\naccredited judge might be identifiable as a good person operating in\nconditions of freedom.\u201d (Of course, this is still to talk about\nwhat is of value for and to persons; the point is to avoid\nrelativization to this or that kind of person or\nkind of end.) So, why would a duly accredited judge see value\nin the free rational adoption and pursuit of ends, where such value is\nnot ascribed because of the contribution that activity makes\nto some other end?\n\nGrice\u2019s views on commonsense psychology provide the answer. As\nnoted earlier, Grice thinks that commonsense psychology exhibits two\nfeatures: parts of it are self-justifying; and, it contains principles\nfor evaluating thought and action, where some of those principles are\nself-justifying. When he turns to ethics, Grice adds that commonsense\npsychology represents us as exercising rationality in freely adopting\nand pursuing ends; moreover, this view of ourselves is self-justifying\nin the sense that we cannot coherently conceive of ourselves in any\nother way. Grice\u2019s\u2014very plausible\u2014claim is that a\n\u201cduly accredited judge\u201d operating from within the theory\nof commonsense psychology would take the rational, free adoption and\npursuit of ends as having unrelativized value. Hence, it does have\nsuch value.\n\nThe second stage: What principles must a free adopter and\npursuer of ends embrace in order to qualify as rational? Grice\naddresses this question most fully in Aspects of Reason and\nThe Conception of Value. The idea is that the combined\nrequirements of rationality (outside ethics), freedom, and happiness\nimpose substantive constraints on all persons. Grice develops this\ntheme with great insight and subtlety; however, he did not complete\nthe project, and the intricacies of his views are best left to the\ndetail of his own works.\n",
