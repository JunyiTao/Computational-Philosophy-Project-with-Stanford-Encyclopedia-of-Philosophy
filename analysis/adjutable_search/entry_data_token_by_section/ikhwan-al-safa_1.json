Goldziher\ndeserves mention: according to which the name could have been borrowed\nfrom the famous collection of fables of indo-persian origin\nKal\u00eela wa Dimna to indicate a group of loyal friends.\nStern (1964, 421), however, considers the name as a way of hinting at\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeliyya. The most convincing hypothesis\nseems to be that which links the name to the content and goals of the\nencyclopedia \u2013 the salvation of soul through attainment of\nknowledge and purification of heart (Diwald 1975,\n16\u201322). Recently, Poonawala hypothesized\n\u201cIkhw\u00e2n al-Saf\u00e2\u2019\u201d to be a pseudonym\nhiding the identity of the authors (Poonawala 2015a, 264 and 272).\n\nAs to the date, in the 19th century F. Dieterici proposed\n961 to 986, basing his estimate on the work of the seventeenth century\nlexicographer H\u00e2jj\u00ee Khal\u00eefa and on the presence in\nthe treatises of verses by the famous poet al-Mutanabb\u00ee (d.\n965). Massignon (1913) used a verse by the poet Ibn\nal-R\u00fbm\u00ee (d. 896) to establish these years as the earliest\npossible date (cf. also Hamdani 1999, 76; Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 12;\n28\u201329), and took the latest possible date to be the one\nindicated by the definition of sine (al-jayb) given by the\nIkhw\u00e2n. Such definition is not yet the one provided by\nal-Batt\u00e2n\u00ee (d. 929; reference to vol. I, p. 46 of the\nBombay ed., 1887-1889, corresponding to I, 86, 14\u201315 of the\nBeirut edition referred to in this article). The \u201cexpected\nevent\u201d frequently mentioned in the encyclopedia would then be\nthe Fatimid conquest of Egypt, which can be traced back to those\nyears. On the basis of astronomical data, Casanova (1915) moved the\ndates about a century forward, assigning the work to the years\n1047\u201351.\n\nUntil some decades ago, the almost universally accepted dating was the\none deduced from the testimonies of al-Tawh\u00eed\u00ee and\n\u2018Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r al-Hamad\u00e2n\u00ee (see above, 1.\nAuthorship). Marquet reconfirmed Dieterici's earlier hypothesis,\nplacing the compilation of the work between 961 and 980\n(al-Tawh\u00eed\u00ee's testimony is dated 981), but he also brought\nthe date back to 909, depending on the hypothesis of an\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eel\u00ee affiliation of the authors. Two\ntreatises have given rise to the idea of an Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli\ninterpretation: Epistle 48 On the invitation (da\u2018wa) to\nGod and Epistle 50 On the kinds of administration. The\nencyclopedia would therefore be the oldest exposition of the\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli doctrine, and consequently, the\n\u201cexpected event\u201d might have been the proclamation of the\nFatimid caliph \u2018Abd All\u00e2h al-Mahd\u00ee in\nIfriqiyya, which happened in that year (Marquet 1981, 95; Marquet\n1972, 66). Hamdani summarizes various opinions concerning the dates of\nthe encyclopedia, and establishes that it was composed in its whole\nbetween 873 and 909 (Hamdani 1978; Hamdani 1999, 78; Hamdani\n2008; Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 15\u201316; Poonawala sides with\nHamdani\u2019s chronology in Baffioni, Poonawala 2017,\n307\u2013308). Hamdani also thinks that the Ikhw\u00e2n awaited the\nadvent of the Fatimids, the Fatimid character of the\nRas\u00e2\u2019il not being in question (Hamdani 1979, 62);\nhe configures a precise role of the im\u00e2m in this epistle\n(Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 6). The fourth section, apart from the first\nand the last treatises, is claimed to be the core around which the\nfirst three sections have been composed (Marquet 1998, 5), as well as\nthe culmination of the epistles, which demonstrates the importance of\nthe mystery of prophecy and of im\u00e2mate (Marquet 1998, 8\u20139\nand note 21). Also Madelung recently sided with the hypothesis of\nan Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelism of the Ikhw\u00e2n\nal-Saf\u00e2\u2019. Recalling that the Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelis\nof Mashriq, Iraq and Iran did not recognize the claims of \u2018Abd\nAll\u00e2h to be the expected im\u00e2m, being rather\ncommitted to the Qarmat mission, Madelung hypothesizes that the\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eelis of Basra recognized as im\u00e2m\nthe member of the family who had remained hidden in\nKhur\u00e2s\u00e2n, the same person who would also become the\nfounder of the secret brotherhood of the Ihw\u00e2n\nal-S\u0323af\u00e2\u2019 (Madelung in print; but cf. De Smet 2017,\n152, note 1). Madelung\u2019s claim that the epistles are\n\u201cunder the auspices of the hidden seventh imam\u201d is\nrejected by Poonawala, since \u201cMu\u1e25ammad b.\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u2019s name is never mentioned in the\nRas\u0101\u2019il\u201d (Baffioni, Poonawala 2017,\n303\u2013305, also on the basis of Hamdani\u2019s opinions).\n\nA quite different chronology is proposed for astronomical cycles by de\nCallata\u00ff based on Epistle 36 On cycles and revolutions. He\ndistinguishes three \u201cmedium conjunctions\u201d of Saturn and\nJupiter occurring every 240 years and a longer conjunction occurring\napproximately every 960 years. The year 571 (birth of the Prophet\nMuhammad) marks a \u201clongest conjunction\u201d (from Libra to\nScorpio); the first \u201cmedium conjunction\u201d in 809 is of no\nimportance to the Ikhw\u00e2n; the second (from Sagittarius to\nCapricorn) should take place in 1047, and would be the \u201cimminent\nconjunction\u201d described in Epistle 48; the third (from Capricorn\nto Aquarius) is awaited in 1286; and the \u201clongest\nconjunction\u201d (from Aquarius to Libra) will take place in 1524\nand will correspond to the rising of the q\u00e2\u2019im of\nthe Resurrection (de Callata\u00ff 2005, 55\u201357; Walker et\nal. 2015, 150\u2013152, 156, 204\u2013206).\n\nThe authors of the encyclopedia have also been confined to a\nMu\u2018tazilite approach, or placed in an earlier age, under the\nQarmat influence (Marquet 1977; Qarmats were the opponents of the\nFatimid caliph \u2018Abd All\u00e2h al-Mahd\u00ee). So did\nMadelung many years ago; but considering his recent opinion, that the\nRas\u00e2\u2019il repudiate the Fatimids\u2019 claim to the\nim\u00e2mate on the basis of the fact that a new-born of eight months\ndoes not survive (that meaning that Muhammad ibn\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eel did not reach the Prophet\u2019s rank; the\nrelevant texts are studied in Baffioni 2016 and 2018), Poonawala\nwonders how he could ascribe the epistles to the Qar\u00e2mita, since\nthis is a a repudiation of the Qar\u00e2mita\u2019s belief\n(Baffioni, Poonawala 2017, 305\u2013307).\n\nMore recent studies, on the line of a seminal article by Fierro\n(Fierro Bello 1996; cf. Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 11\u201312, but also\nCarusi 2000), have identified Maslama b. Q\u00e2sim al-Qurtub\u00ee,\ncalled al-Majr\u00eet\u00ee (d. 964, previously confused with the\nscientist Maslama al-Majr\u00ee\u1e6d\u00ee, d. 1007) as the author\nof the encyclopedia (cf. Hamdani 1999, 75; de Callata\u00ff 2013,\nKacimi 2014a, b, de Callata\u00ff, Moureau 2015). However, the one who\nintroduced in Spain the whole work is still to be considered Abu\n\u2019l-\u1e24akam al-Kirm\u00e2n\u00ee, d. 1066). Because of this\nnew discovery, the timing of the Ras\u00e2\u2019il has\nbeen anticipated of several decades at least. So, the old attribution\nof al-Tawh\u00eed\u00ee and \u2018Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r was revoked\nin doubt, beginning with de Callata\u00ff who had previously accepted\nit (de Callata\u00ff 2014; cf. Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 14\u201315; a\nreconstruction of the journey, material and intellectual, of Maslama\nal-Qurtub\u00ee in al-Andalus is in de Callata\u00ff, Moureau 2017).\nMaslama al-Qurtub\u00ee has been also recognized as the author of\nRutbat al-\u1e25ak\u00eem (\u2018The level of the\nwise man\u2019) and Gh\u00e2yat al-\u1e25ak\u00eem\n(\u2018The goal of the wise man\u2019, being known in Latin as\nPicatrix), two important works on alchemy and magic\nrespectively that are now both to be reported to the first half of the\n10th century. Scholars have also emphasized the impact of\nthe encyclopedia on these two works, and it has even been hypothesized\nMaslama to be one of the authors of the epistles (Carusi 2000), which\nshould not date later than 950. In the light of this new chronology,\nde Callata\u00ff 2014 examines the possible influence of the\nIkhw\u00e2n on Ibn Masarra (d. 931), especially on his cosmology,\nreporting this author to the Andalusi b\u00e2\u1e6din\u00ee context\nof the first half of the tenth century. If the epistles were\ncirculating in al-Andalus already before 950, and their compilation\nmust have begun some time before in the East, another consequence is\nthat the Ikhw\u00e2n influenced al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee and not\nvice versa, as it was believed so far (Hamdani 2011). According to\nPoonawala, the encyclopedia was composed after al-Kind\u00ee (d.\nbetween 864 and 870) but before al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee (d. 950;\nPoonawala 2011, Introduction, 59). Among those who sustain the\nattribution of the epistles to Maslama al-Qurtub\u00ee is also\nMadelung who, therefore, rejects a too high dating of the epistles.\nThe scholar has speculated that Maslama not only brought the\nencyclopedia to Spain, but also contributed to its composition: there\nwould have been a first version, no longer existing, compiled not long\nbefore 937, the one described by al-Tawh\u00eed\u00ee, and\nconsisting of previously existing epistles and of epistles especially\ncomposed for the purpose; the Brotherhood would have been founded a\nfew decades earlier (Madelung 2018, 404).\n\nIn recent times, al-Tawh\u00eed\u00ee\u2019s and \u2018Abd\nal-Jabb\u00e2r\u2019s attribution has been reconsidered by\nemphasizing the Fatimid militancy of some among the pretended authors\nof the encyclopedia (Reymond 2011, 124\u2013125). Hamdani recalls\nthat, according to al-Tawh\u00eed\u00ee, such personages were\nQarmats, so that al-Tawh\u00eed\u00ee could accuse of eresy Zayd b.\nRif\u00e2\u2018a, too (Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 7\u20138, where the\ntestimony of al-Qift\u00ee is also discussed \u2013 that the alleged\nauthors were followers of the im\u00e2m \u2018Al\u00ee).\nHamdani even exploits al-Tawh\u00eed\u00ee\u2019s observation that\nthe Ras\u00e2\u2019il were widely read, as further evidence\nthat they would have been written long before (cf. also de Vaulx\nd\u2019Arcy 2019b). Poonawala shares historians\u2019 doubts on\nal-Tawh\u00eed\u00ee\u2019s reliability and concludes that his one\n\u201cis certainly a hostile witness\u201d that implies the\nauthors\u2019 affiliation with the Qar\u00e2mita of Basra (Baffioni,\nPoonawala 2017, 294). Following Hamdani\u2019s\n\u201cdeconstruction\u201d, the witness is considered to be\n\u201cvery suspicious\u201d, all the more so if one considers that\nmost medieval authors and modern scholars are used to equate the\nQar\u00e2mita with the Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelis (Poonawala in\nBaffioni, Poonawala 2017, 298). Poonawala also emphasizes\nStern\u2019s remark on the q\u00e2d\u00ee Abu\n\u2019l-Hasan \u2018Al\u00ee b. H\u00e2r\u00fbn\nal-Zanj\u00e2n\u00ee \u2013 that \u2018Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r writes\nagainst the Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelis without mentioning the\nBrethren at all (Baffioni, Poonawala 2017, 301\u2013302).\n\nA new hypothesis on the real author of the\nRas\u00e2\u2019il has been formulated in Guillaume de\nVaulx d\u2019Arcy\u2019s doctoral dissertation. The author tries to\ndemonstrate that Ahmad b. al-Tayyib al-Sarakhs\u00ee, a pupil of\nal-Kind\u00ee, composed the whole encyclopedia in about 894 in the\nform in which we read it now (de Vaulx d\u2019Arcy 2016, partially\nreelaborated in de Vaulx d\u2019Arcy 2019a [non vidi]).\n\nBut the questions of the identity and ideology of the Ikhw\u00e2n\nal-Saf\u00e2\u2019 still remain unsolved. In recent times, Kacimi\n2016 has come back to the relationship between the Ikhw\u00e2n and\nthe Sufi thought. Poonawala refuses them to have been Sufi, though\nsome MSS, included the MS Atif Efendi 1618 (dated 1182, on which the\nnew edition of the Institute of Ismaili Studies is based), bear in the\ntitle the mention of the Sufi school \u2013 or doctrines. Mayer\nthinks that to result from a later, Sunni manuscript tradition,\n\u201cin which the acceptance, or at least toleration, of esoteric\nmaterial was made likelier by presenting it as proper to\n\u1e62\u016bf\u012b circles, whose respectability [\u2026] had been\nestablished by a figure of the magnitude of Ghaz\u0101l\u012b.\u201d\n(Traboulsi et al. 2016, 7).\n\nThe traces of classical thought in the encyclopedia, as well as their\nliterary form, equally give an indication that the work was assembled\nin the course of several decades between the 9th and the\nfirst half of the 10th century, and that it may have\nundergone further elaborations. Such a collective enterprise can be\nconsidered as the result of a \u201cstratified\u201d compilation.\nThe supposed reworking of the whole by members of the Brotherhood\nmight also have shifted some Epistles from their original to their\npresent place. Even the headings of the four sections of the\nencyclopedia are misleading. The way in which the treatises follow one\nanother is often inconsistent. The authors must have planned a special\nuse of the enormous amount of foreign philosophical and scientific\nknowledge that is explained in the treatises and to develop it in\nrelation to the doctrinal conflicts and political changes that were\noccurring in their own times. In this sense the presentation of the\nencyclopedia as a \u201cpopular\u201d work (Rudolph, 2004, 39)\nshould be rejected.\n",
