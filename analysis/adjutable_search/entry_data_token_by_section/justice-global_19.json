He\npresents the classic so-called realist case, which is highly\ninfluential in international politics, such that there is a state of\nnature in the international realm. All states compete in pursuing\ntheir own advantage and since there is no global authority there can\nbe no justice in international affairs. Also for an overview of some\nkey work on realism in political philosophy, see the entry on\n political realism in international relations\n and Rossi and Sleat 2014.\n\nOthers are more optimistic. Since we already have a high level of\ninteraction among states, organizations and other agents, this has\ngenerated various norms and expectations about appropriate conduct\nthat guides behavior in the international sphere (Beitz 1999).\nMoreover, we have a strong interest in co-operation when this is\nnecessary to deal practically with a range of problems that have\nglobal reach. Global governance is concerned with how we manage\ninterests affecting the residents of more than one state in the\nabsence of a world state. There is already a high level of\nco-operation among a variety of networks, organizations and other\ngroups of interested parties at the sub-state level, and this is\npowerfully influencing the redesign of best practice norms in\nparticular domains (Slaughter 2004). Some argue for a global state or\ndemocratic system \u2013 often with subsidiarity or some kind of\npoly-centric political order, and others argue for more limited forms\nof legitimate global governance (Cabrera 2018; Gould 2004, 2014; Held\n2004; Kuper 2004; Buchanan and Keohane 2006).\n\nOther change agents that can and have exercised considerable reform\npressures include global social movements, such as the anti-sweatshop\nmovement, the fair trade movement, and other ethical consumption\nmovements. Global activism has been an important source of incremental\nchange. These simple examples show that much more is possible in the\nabsence of a world state than realists acknowledge.\n\nFor more on issues of world government, see the entry on\n world government,\n which provides extended treatment of this issue.\n",
