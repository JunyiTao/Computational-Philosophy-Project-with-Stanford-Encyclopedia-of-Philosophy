The Commentary Tradition in Late Antiquity: The Place of the Categories in the Reading Curriculum\n\nThe study of Aristotle through close textual reading of his works\ncontinued, if not increased, in Late Antiquity. So did the supply of\ncommentaries on all his major works. Unlike Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nmost of these commentators considered themselves followers of Plato\n(that is, Platonists.) By their lights, Plato\u2019s philosophy was\nsuperior to all the systems of thought that came later. In addition,\nthey believed that all these later systems started out as more or less\nfaithful developments of Plato\u2019s philosophy. Aristotle was no\nexception to the rule. On the contrary, these commentators viewed\nAristotle as a true descendant of Plato. This explains why, by\nreverting to Plato, they did not mean to reject Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophy. On the contrary, they were convinced that this philosophy\ncould be integrated into a Platonic framework. The Platonism of Late\nAntiquity was so comprehensive as a system of thought that it could\nharbor Aristotle\u2019s philosophy as one of its elements. In this\nframe of mind, a major exegetical concern became that of finding\nsubstantial agreement between Plato and Aristotle. For most of these\ncommentators, the disagreement on specific issues between Aristotle\nand Plato did not preclude harmony between the two philosophers on a\ndeeper level.\n\nIn reality, the conciliation of Plato and Aristotle attempted by these\ncommentators consisted in an appropriation of Aristotle\u2019s works\nas a pre-requisite for the study of Plato\u2019s philosophy. Among\nthese works, the Categories continued to enjoy a special\nstatus. Following a tradition that may go all the way back to\nAndronicus of Rhodes (see the section on the early fortune of the\nCategories), this treatise was considered an elementary\nintroduction to the whole of philosophy and as such it was used to\nteach beginners with little or no knowledge of philosophy (Porphyry,\nIn Cat. 56. 28\u201329). For this reason the exegetical\nactivity on this short but difficult treatise never stopped but in\nfact increased in Late Antiquity. The key figure for the reception of\nthe Categories during this period was undoubtedly Porphyry\n(ca 234\u2013305 CE). The latter wrote a commentary in seven\nbooks addressed to a student named Gedalius. In this commentary,\nPorphyry offered a complete interpretation of the Categories,\nincluding a resolution of all previous aporiai (Simplicius,\nIn Cat. 2. 6\u20139). He also dealt with the traditional\ncriticism of the Categories, including a comprehensive\ndiscussion of the objections leveled by the earlier interpreters of\nthe Categories (e.g., the Stoic Athenodorus and Cornutus, and\nthe Platonic Lucius and Nicostratus). His defense of the\nCategories relied, and indeed expanded, on the Peripatetic\ntradition (e.g., Boethus of Sidon, Alexander of Aphrodisias). An\nexcerpt from this commentary has been recently discovered in what is\nknown as the Archimedes Palimpsest (See R. Chiaradonna, M. Rashed, and\nD. Sedley 2013). Porphyry wrote another commentary on the\nCategories. This second commentary has reached us. The\nresults achieved in the more comprehensive commentary are here\nabbreviated, simplified, and made accessible in the form of a dialogue\nbetween a teacher and a pupil. The existence of two commentaries\nwritten in a different format on the very same treatise by the same\nauthor has to be understood in the light of the fact that these\ncommentaries were teaching tools and were used to teach students with\ndifferent skills and different levels of familiarity with the\nCategories. Finally, Porphyry is the author of the\nIsagoge (literally, \u201cIntroduction\u201d).\nThis short book is an introduction to Aristotle\u2019s theory of\npredication. It is addressed to absolute beginners in philosophy whose\nreading curriculum then continued with Aristotle\u2019s logic,\nbeginning with the Categories.\n\nThe commentary addressed to Gedalius became an instant success and an\nexample to imitate. Iamblichus (ca 242\u2013325 CE) is known\nto have written a commentary on the Categories that closely\nfollowed this commentary, abbreviating the argument and making the\noverall interpretation clearer. He is also known to have amplified the\nPorphyrian interpretation with the help of the book that the\nPythagorean Archytas wrote on the doctrine of the categories\n(Simplicius, In Cat. 2.9\u201314). The writing in question\nis a late forgery intended to claim Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the\nten categories for the Pythagorean school. Iamblichus considered this\nforgery an authentic anticipation of Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories and a vindication of his vision of philosophy as a\nsingle tradition of wisdom, starting with Pythagoras and continuing\nwith Plato and Aristotle. Iamblichus is reported to have made use of\nthe considerations of Archytas in the attempt to demonstrate the\noverall agreement between Aristotle and the Pythagorean doctrine.\n\nIamblichus\u2019 commentary is lost, but we can form an idea of the\ncontribution that this commentary made to the ancient debate on the\nCategories thanks to Dexippus. Nothing is known about\nDexippus besides the fact that he was a pupil of Iamblichus. His\nsurviving commentary provides a concise and clear presentation of the\nsolutions offered to the aporiai leveled against\nAristotle\u2019s Categories. Dexippus opted for the\nquestion-and-answer format, which better suited his purpose to provide\na brief and relatively simple summary of the exegetical results\nachieved by his predecessors, especially Porphyry and Iamblichus.\nDexippus was not an original thinker. According to Simplicius, he\nadded virtually nothing to the considerations of Porphyry and\nIamblichus (Simplicius, In Cat. 2. 29\u201330).\n\nAfter having mastered the Categories, the student of\nphilosophy was expected to read the rest of the Aristotelian corpus\nbefore turning to Plato\u2019s dialogues. Syrianus, the teacher of\nProclus (ca 410\u2013485 CE), exposed his students to both\nPlato and Aristotle, starting with Aristotle. Proclus arrived in\nAthens around 430 CE, at a time when Plutarch, the previous head of\nthe school, was an old man and Syrianus had already taken over. As a\nyoung and gifted student, Proclus read Aristotle\u2019s De\nanima and Plato\u2019s Phaedo with Plutarch. But when\nPlutarch died, Syrianus became responsible for his philosophical\neducation. Under the direction of Syrianus, Proclus mastered in less\nthan two years the entire Aristotelian corpus. He studied the logical,\nethical, political, physical works and finished up with theology\n(Marinus, Life of Proclus, chapters 12 and 13). The sequence\nlogic-ethics-politics-physics-theology reflected not only a certain\norganization of the teaching but also a particular conception of\nphilosophy. To begin with, the first place assigned to\nAristotle\u2019s logical writings was not neutral with respect to a\ncertain view of the nature of logic. By this time logic was regarded\nas a tool for philosophy. This conception of logic and its relation to\nthe rest of philosophy is reflected in the collective title\nOrganon that we still use to refer to Aristotle\u2019s\nlogical writings. Moreover, the non-theological writings were\npreliminary to the study of theology as it is offered in the\nMetaphysics. This treatise was the last of Aristotle\u2019s\nworks to be studied. The conception of God as an intellect and a\nliving being enjoying the state of perfect actuality was designed by\nSyrianus as the culmination of his course on Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophy. Once Proclus had mastered the Metaphysics and\nlearned about the Aristotelian conception of the divine, Syrianus\ndirected him to Plato, whose dialogues were also read in a definite\nsequence, culminating with the Timaeus and the\nParmenides.\n\nThis attitude toward the philosophy of Aristotle and Plato was passed\nfrom Syrianus to Proclus, and from Proclus to Ammonius (ca\n440\u2013520 CE). The commentaries of Ammonius on the\nCategories, the De Interpretatione, the Prior\nAnalytics, and Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge have come down\nto us. The last is the earliest extant commentary on the\nIsagoge. By this time the Isagoge had already\nestablished itself as part of the reading curriculum of philosophy,\nwhich continued with the Categories, the De\nInterpretatione and the Prior Analytics. Note, however,\nthat Ammonius did not write his commentaries on the\nCategories, the Prior Analytics, and perhaps the\nIsagoge. They were produced by pupils who attended his\nlectures on Aristotle. (For further information and discussion of his\ncommentaries, see Section 1.2 of the entry on\n Ammonius.)\n Other commentaries originated in the lecture room as a transcription\nof the oral exposition delivered by the teacher. The commentaries on\nthe Categories based on the lectures offered by Olympiodorus\n(ca 495\u2013565 CE) and his pupil Elias (David) have\nreached us. Philoponus (ca 490\u2013570 CE) edited his own\nlectures on the Categories. However, the most influential of\nthese later commentaries was the one that Simplicius wrote after 529\nCE. Simplicius was a man of vast learning and extraordinary synthetic\npowers. He was also acutely aware of writing at the end of a long and\nvenerable exegetical tradition. He consciously tried to assimilate and\nblend together the various strands of this tradition. By so doing he\nleft us the most comprehensive and informative survey of the reception\nof the Categories in antiquity. At first sight Simplicius may\nlook like a modern scholar. His commentary shows the great care and\nprecision of a thoughtful and dedicated interpreter who is explicating\nthe Categories through a close reading of the text. Yet there\nis one important difference that must not be overlooked. Simplicius\nwas a Platonist and his exegetical activity was intended to show that\nPlato and Aristotle were in substantial agreement. Simplicius is\nadamantly clear on his own exegetical ideal:\n\n<the worthy interpreter> must, I believe, not convict the\nphilosopher of discordance by looking only at the letter of what\n<Aristotle> says against Plato; but he must look towards the\nspirit, and track down the harmony which reigns between them on the\nmajority of points (Simplicius, In Cat. 7. 29\u201332,\ntrans. Michael Case)\n\n\nThe commentary tradition that found its culmination in Simplicius\nconsisted in a sincere attempt to arrive at a better understanding of\nthe Categories. By reading Simplicius\u2019 commentary one\nstill gets a sense of the extraordinary ingenuity that this tradition\nemployed in explicating this short yet elusive treatise. But\none also gets the impression that this tradition had no privileged\naccess to this text. Quite the opposite: from the beginning of the\nrevival of interest in the philosophy of Aristotle and into Late\nAntiquity, the Categories remained a tantalizing puzzle. Not\nonly its title, but also its unity, structure, and place in the\nAristotelian corpus were intensely discussed. For instance, various\ntitles are attested in the commentary tradition: Introduction to\nthe Topics, On the Genera of Being, On the Ten\nGenera, The Ten Categories, Categories\n(Simplicius, In Cat. 15.  26\u201330). Each of these titles\nreflected a certain interpretation of what the treatise is\nabout. Andronicus is the first interpreter who is known to have\npreferred the title Categories. He rejected the title\nIntroduction to the Topics and considered the final chapters\nof the Categories\u2014the so-called\nPostpraedicamenta\u2014a later addition contrary to the\npurpose of the book. He held that the people who added those chapters\nalso inscribed the book with the title Introduction to the\nTopics (Simplicius, In Cat. 279. 8\u201310). By\ncontrast, Adrastus of Aphrodisias defended the relationship between\nthe Categories and the Topics in a work entitled\nConcerning the Order of Aristotle\u2019s Treatises\n(Simplicius, In Cat. 16. 1\u20134). The dispute was not\nconfined to the organization Aristotle\u2019s works, but it extended\nto the philosophical significance of the treatise. The title\nCategories eventually prevailed and, along with the title, a\ncertain interpretation of the treatise imposed itself.\n",
