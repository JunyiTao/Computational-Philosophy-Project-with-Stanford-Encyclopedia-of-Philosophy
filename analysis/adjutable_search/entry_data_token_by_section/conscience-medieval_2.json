    "main_text": "Background: The Pagan and Early-Christian Context || St. Jerome: The Invention of Synderesis\n1.3 St. Jerome: The Invention of Synderesis\n\nThat conscience was so central a concept in St. Paul\u2019s writings\nguaranteed it an important place in the moral theology of the Greek\nand Latin Fathers, especially St. Basil, John Damascene and St.\nAmbrose. Amongst these early writers, however, it was a text from St.\nJerome that was particularly consequential since it introduced into\nthe debate a neologism that would have an important impact in the\nlater Middle Ages: the concept of synderesis.\n\nIn the course of commenting on Ezekiel, Jerome had tied a\nprophecy mentioned in its first book to Plato\u2019s moral psychology\n(commentary on Ezekiel 1.7). The prophecy in question\nconsisted of a vision of four creatures emerging from the heavens,\neach with four faces: those of a man, a lion, an ox and an eagle\n(Ezekiel 1: 4\u201314). In his gloss, Jerome noted that \u201cmost\npeople\u201d (plerique) interpreted this vision with\nreference to Plato\u2019s tripartite division of the soul in the\nRepublic: the human face representing reason, the\nlion\u2019s face the spirited part, and the ox\u2019s face the\nappetitive part (cf. Plato, Republic, 436b\u2013441b). What\ndid the eagle represent? According to Jerome, it represented that\n\u201cspark of conscience\u201d (scintilla conscientiae)\nwhich makes us aware of our sinfulness when reason, spirit or desire\nbecome disordered. Medieval manuscripts refer to this psychological\nproperty as synderesis (or sometimes\nsynteresis):\n\n\nNow above these three was the eagle; so in the soul, they say, above\nthe other three elements and beyond them is a fourth, which the Greeks\ncall synderesis. This is that spark of conscience which was\nnot quenched even in the heart of Cain, when he was driven out of\nparadise. This it is that which makes us, too, feel our sinfulness\nwhen we are overcome by evil Desire or unbridled Spirit, or deceived\nby sham Reason. It is natural to identify synderesis with the eagle,\nsince it is distinct from the other three elements and corrects them\nwhen they err [\u2026] However, we also see that this conscience\n(conscientia) is cast down in some people, who have neither\nshame nor insight regarding their offences, and loses its place\n[\u2026]. (commentary on Ezekiel 1.7; D\u2019Arcy trans.\n1961: 16\u201317)\n\n\nMost scholars now agree that the neologism \u201csynderesis\u201d\nintroduced in Jerome\u2019s commentary is simply a corruption of the\nGreek syneidesis (Kries 2002: 67). Since syneidesis\nis simply the Greek equivalent of the Latin term\nconscientia\u2014a fact of which Jerome would certainly have\nbeen aware\u2014one might have expected Jerome to use them\ninterchangeably. Surprisingly, however, Jerome suggests that the Latin\nterm means something different from the Greek term. In the text cited\nabove, he quite explicitly states that regardless of how morally\ncorrupt its possessor becomes, synderesis can never be lost. A few\nlines later, however, he does admit the existence of those who are\nshameless and lacking in moral insight. Such people are oblivious to\ntheir offenses because, according to Jerome, their conscience\n(conscientia) ceases to be present in them (\u201clooses its\nplace\u201d). If synderesis cannot be lost, but conscience can, then\nit seems to follow that they are separate properties of the soul. In\nany case, whatever Jerome\u2019s intention, this curious passage was\nindirectly handed down to the Middle Ages via the Sentences\nof Peter Lombard (1095\u20131160).\n",
