    "main_text": "Epistemological Objections || Objections to CORNEA Principles\n5.1 Objections to CORNEA Principles\n\nCORNEA principles state a necessary condition on it being reasonable\nto claim or believe p on the basis of something q.\nThe condition (roughly) is that it is also reasonable for one to\nbelieve that, given one\u2019s cognitive faculties, if p\nwere different, then q would likely be different as well. A\nstandard worry for epistemic principles like this is that they will\ncreate an infinite regress (cf. Alston 1980, Fumerton 1995 (chapter\n2), Leite 2008). And some have objected to CORNEA principles for\nexactly this reason (Swinburne 1998: 32\u20133). To see how the\nregress might go, suppose I\u2019m reasonable in believing p\non the basis of q. Then, by a CORNEA principle, I am also\nreasonable in believing that, given my cognitive faculties, if\np were false, then q would likely be different. But\nsuppose that belief is reasonable but based on something\nr. Well, applying a CORNEA principle again, it must be\nreasonable for me to believe that, were that belief different, then\nr would likely be different\u2026 ad\ninfinitum.\n\nA different objection is that CORNEA-principles are inconsistent with\nforming reasonable beliefs on the basis of inductive evidence\n(McBrayer 2009; Almeida 2014: 122ff). For instance, suppose the day\ncare center informs me that each day, for the past three months, my\nchild has been sleeping during nap time. On the basis of this\ninductive evidence, it is reasonable for me to infer that\ntoday my child will sleep during nap time. But if my child\nwere not sleeping during nap time today, would my inductive\nevidence be different? Using standard possible-world semantics, it\nwould not. For in the closest worlds in which my child is not\nsleeping, it is likely a fluke or random event. And in those worlds, I\nwould still have my inductive evidence from the past. Thus, in this\ncase, S-C implies that it is not reasonable\nto infer my child is sleeping today on the basis of my inductive\nevidence. But this example of inductive reasoning is not particularly\ndistinctive. So S-C is inconsistent with forming\nreasonable beliefs on the basis of inductive evidence.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to clarify CORNEA-principles in ways\nthat avoids these problems while still being strong enough for\nresponding to arguments from evil (see Wykstra 1996, 2007; Wykstra and\nPerrine 2012; Perrine 2022). One clarification is that CORNEA\nprinciples are restricted to a specific kind of case: where the\ngrounds or evidence for belief is \u201clevering evidence,\u201d\nwhich is (crudely put) evidence strong enough to reasonably\n\u201clever\u201d one from agnosticism or disbelief about p\nto belief about p. The restriction of CORNEA-principles to\nthis type of evidence or grounds is appropriate, since it is the kind\nof evidence that Rowe (1979) initially tried to provide. Restricting\nCORNEA-principles in this way may also block an infinite regress,\nsince the CORNEA-principles are not fully general. A second\nclarification is that the condition in CORNEA-principles should\nnot be interpreted as involving a subjunctive-conditional,\nbut rather a conditional probability. That is, the condition is that\nit is reasonable to believe, given one\u2019s cognitive faculties,\nthat the conditional probability of one\u2019s grounds or evidence,\ngiven one\u2019s belief is false, is below .5. Though some of the\ndetails are technical, Wykstra and Perrine argue that a probabilistic\nunderstanding of CORNEA\u2019s requirement handles cases of inductive\nevidence. But whether or not these clarifications ultimately help\ndefuse objections is still a topic of debate.
