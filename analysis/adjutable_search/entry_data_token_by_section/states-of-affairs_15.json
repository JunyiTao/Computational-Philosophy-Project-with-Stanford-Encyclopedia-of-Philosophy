    "main_text": "The Unity of a State of Affairs || External Unification\n6.2 External Unification\n\nWhile Russell does not refute the view that there are states of\naffairs, he asks philosophers who believe in them a difficult\nquestion. To see the force of the constraint he imposes on answers to\nthe unity-question consider a proposal that violates it. External\ntheories develop the following general idea (I take the\n\u201cexternal/internal\u201d terminology from Vallicella 2000):\n\nThe state of affairs a\u2019s being F exists if, and\nonly if, there is something distinct from a, being\nF and a\u2019s being F & it unifies\na and being F to form a\u2019s being\nF.\n\nRoughly speaking, the external unifier can bring the constituents of\nstates of affairs together even if they don\u2019t constitute a fact.\nA psychological version of the External Theory is proposed in\nValicella 2000. According to him, the external ground of unity is the\njudging consciousness that brings about the unity of a state of\naffairs (Valicella 2000: 252).\n\nRussell, in turn, argued that a mental act cannot unify some things to\nform a state of affairs:\n\n\nSuppose we wish to understand \u201cA and B are\nsimilar\u201d. It is essential that our thought should, as is said,\n\u201cunite\u201d or \u201csynthesize\u201d the two terms and the\nrelation; but we cannot actually \u201cunite\u201d them,\nsince either A and B are similar, in which case they are\nalready united, or they are dissimilar, in which case no amount of\nthinking can force them to be united. (Russell 1913: 116)\n\n\nAny mental activity seems simply to be unable to create unity where\nnone obtains already. If I think of a and being\nF, why should a new complex object consisting of them come\ninto existence? Russell himself goes on to suppose that the mind is\nable to unite A, B and similarity with a logical form.\nHow the mind can have that ability goes unexplained.\n\nThe linguistic version of the External Theory takes states of affairs\nto be descripta of sentences that owe their unity to the sentences\nthat describe them:\n\n\nThe state of affairs a\u2019s being F exists\nif, and only if, there is a sentence of a language L (or an extension\nof L) that concatenates a singular term referring to a and a\ngeneral term referring to F. (see Taylor 1985: 29ff; King 2009:\n263)\n\n\nThe linguistic version gives up on the view that states of affairs are\nlanguage independent (see King 2009: 259 who concedes this). There is\nnothing in our intuitive notion of states of affairs that justifies\nthe assumption that states of affairs depend for their unity on the\nexistence of a language in which they are described. For example,\nthere will be a space of probable outcomes of an event whether there\nare descriptions of them or not.\n\nThe criticism of the External Theory makes Russell\u2019s constraint\non an answer to the unity-question plausible. States of affairs are\nconceived of as sui generis entities that do not owe their\nunity and hence their identity to anything else.\n",
