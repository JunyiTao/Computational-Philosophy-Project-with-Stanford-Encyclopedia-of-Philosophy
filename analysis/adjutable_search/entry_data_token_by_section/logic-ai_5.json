    "main_text": "Spatial Reasoning\n6. Spatial Reasoning\n\n\nThe precomputational literature in philosophical logic relating to\nspatial reasoning is very sparse in relation, for instance, to the\ntemporal literature. The need to support computational reasoning about\nspace, however, in application areas such as motion planning and\nmanipulation in physical space, the indexing and retrieval of images,\ngeographic information systems, diagrammatic reasoning, and the design\nof high-level graphics programs has led to new interest in spatial\nrepresentations and spatial reasoning. Of course, the geometrical\ntradition provides an exceptionally strong mathematical resource for\nthis enterprise. But as in many other AI-related areas, it is not clear\nthat the available mathematical theories are appropriate for informing\nthese applications, and many computer scientists have felt it\nworthwhile to develop new foundations. Some of this work is closely\nrelated to the research in qualitative reasoning mentioned above in\n Section 2.2,\n and in some cases has been carried\nout by the same individuals. \n\n\nThe literature in spatial reasoning is extensive; for references to\nsome areas not discussed here, see\n Stock 1997,\n Kapur & Mundy 1988,\n Hammer 1995,\n Wilson 1998,\n Osherson & Lasnik 1990,\n Renz & Nebel 1999,\n Yeap & Jeffries 1999,\n Forbus et al. 1991,\n Chen 1990,\n Burger & Bhanu 1992,\n Allwein & Barwise 1996,\n Glasgow et al. 1995,\n and\n Kosslyn 1990.\n Here, we discuss only one\ntrend, which is closely connected with parallel work in philosophical\nlogic.\n\n\nQualitative approaches to space were introduced into the logical\nliterature early in the twentieth century by Lesniewski; see\n Lesniewski 1916,\n which presents the idea\nof a mereology, or qualitative theory of the part-whole\nrelation between physical individuals. This idea of a logical theory of\nrelations among regions or the objects that occupy them, which does not\ndepend on construing regions as sets of points, remained an active area\nof philosophical logic, even though it attracted relatively few\nresearchers. More recent work in the philosophical literature,\nespecially\n Casati & Varzi 1999,\n Simons 1987,\n Casati & Varzi 1996,\n Clarke 1981,\n Clarke 1985,\n as directly influential on\ncurrent computational work.\n\n\nThe Regional Connection Calculus (RCC), developed by computer\nscientists at the University of Leeds, is based on a primitive\nC relating regions of space: the intended interpretation of\nC(x, y) is that the intersection of the\nclosures of the values of x and y is nonempty.\n (See\n Cohn et al. 1997,\n Cohn 1996)\n for details and references.) One\narea of research concerns the definability of shapes in RCC. The extent\nof what can be defined with this simple primitive is surprising, but\nthe technicalities quickly become complex; see, for instance,\n Gotts 1994,\n Gotts 1996).\n The work cited in\n Cohn et al. 1997\n describes constraint propagation techniques and\nencodings in intuitionistic propositional logic as ways of supporting\nimplemented reasoning based on RCC and some of its extensions. More\nrecent work based on RCC addresses representation and reasoning about\nmotion, which of course combines spatial and temporal issues; see\n Wolter & Zakharyaschev 2000).\n For more information about qualitative theories of movement,\nwith references to other approaches, see\n Galton 1997.\n",
