    "main_text": "\n\nThe Mohist Canons are a set of brief statements on a variety\nof philosophical and other topics by anonymous members of the\n Mohist school,\n an influential philosophical, social, and religious movement of\nChina\u2019s Warring States period (479\u2013221\n B.C.).[1]\n Written and compiled most likely between the late 4th and mid 3rd\ncentury B.C., the Canons are often referred to as the\n\u201clater Mohist\u201d or \u201cNeo-Mohist\u201d canons, since\nthey seem chronologically later than the Mohist\n \u201ctriads,\u201d\n the two dozen essays that constitute the bulk of the Mohist writings,\nwhich probably date from the mid-5th to the late 4th century. The\nCanons present philosophical ideas distinct from the older\ntexts, though clearly closely related to or evolved from them. The\nlater Mohists are also associated with the\n \u201cSchool of Names,\u201d\n a general label for ancient Chinese thinkers who were interested in\nlanguage and argumentation. Early sources link the Mohists with the\nSchool of Names through a shared interest in disputation over the\n\u201chard and white\u201d and the \u201csame and different\u201d\n(Zhuangzi, Book 33).\n\nThe Canons, their accompanying Explanations, and\nother later Mohist writings are among the most important texts in the\nhistory of Chinese ethics, philosophy of language, epistemology,\nlogic, and science. They present elements of a sophisticated semantic\ntheory, epistemology, consequentialist ethics, and theory of\nanalogical argumentation, along with intriguing discussions of\ncausality, space and time, and mereological ontology. Also recorded\nare inquiries in such diverse fields as geometry, mechanics, optics,\nand economics. The writers put forward terse, rigorous arguments that\ndevelop and defend Mohist ideas and rebut opponents\u2019 views. The\ntexts yield a rich taste of an approach to language, mind, and\nknowledge distinct from those dominant in the Western philosophical\ntradition. At the same time, by shedding light on technical notions\nemployed in other ancient writings, they confirm that a grasp of early\ntheories of language, knowledge, and argumentation is essential to a\nfull understanding of classical Chinese thought. Indeed, the later\nMohists decisively refute the once widespread view that ancient\nChinese thinkers were concerned exclusively with ethics, moral\npsychology, and nature mysticism and uninterested in language,\nepistemology, and logic. \n\nGiven the breadth and richness of later Mohist thought, this article\ncan present only a narrow sample. We will focus on a handful of core\nideas and issues in ethics, philosophy of language, epistemology,\nontology, and disputation.  (For a rough guide to the pronunciation of\nsome of the Chinese terms used in this article, see the  supplementary\n document\n Pronunciation Guide.)\n\n",
