    "main_text": "\n\nKant\u2019s philosophy focuses on the power and limits of reason. Two\nquestions are central. In his theoretical philosophy, Kant asks\nwhether reasoning can give us metaphysical knowledge. In particular,\ncan reason ground insights that go \u201cbeyond\u201d\n(meta) the physical world, as \u201crationalist\u201d\nphilosophers such as Leibniz and Descartes claimed? In his practical\nphilosophy, Kant asks whether reason can guide action and justify\nmoral principles. \u201cEmpiricist\u201d philosophers claimed that\nonly feelings can motivate us to act; reason cannot. In Hume\u2019s\nfamous words: \u201cReason is wholly inactive, and can never be the\nsource of so active a principle as conscience, or a sense of\nmorals\u201d (Treatise, 3.1.1.11).\n\nAgainst rationalist metaphysics, Kant claims that reasoning faces\nstrict limits. Reason cannot give us knowledge of God or a world\nbeyond the senses; reasoning falls into contradiction and confusion if\nit does not respect these boundaries.\n\nAgainst the empiricist account of motivation and morality, Kant argues\nthat reason has a vital power. Reason enables us to act on principles\nthat we can share with other rational beings. In a world of limits,\nreason reveals human\n freedom.[1]\n\nThis entry has the following structure. The first section sets out the\nrole that reason plays in Kant\u2019s account of knowledge and\nmetaphysics. This focuses on the Critique of Pure Reason or\n\u201cfirst Critique\u201d (1781, second edition 1787). The\nsecond section examines his moral philosophy. This focuses on his\nCritique of Practical Reason or \u201csecond\nCritique\u201d (1788). Reflecting Kant\u2019s own works and\nmost of the secondary literature, these two sections are relatively\nindependent. The third section therefore considers the relations\nbetween theoretical and practical reason. Since Kant rarely discusses\nreason as a whole, his general view is a matter of interpretation:\nOnora O\u2019Neill has given the most prominent account. The\nconcluding remarks stress the philosophical interest of her unified\ninterpretation.\n",
