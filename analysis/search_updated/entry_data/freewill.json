    "preamble": "\n\nThe term \u201cfree will\u201d has emerged over the past two\nmillennia as the canonical designator for a significant kind of\ncontrol over one\u2019s actions. Questions concerning the\nnature and existence of this kind of control (e.g., does it require\nand do we have the freedom to do otherwise or the power of\nself-determination?), and what its true significance is (is it\nnecessary for moral responsibility or human dignity?) have been taken\nup in every period of Western philosophy and by many of the most\nimportant philosophical figures, such as Plato, Aristotle, Augustine,\nAquinas, Descartes, and Kant. (We cannot undertake here a review of\nrelated discussions in other philosophical traditions. For a start,\nthe reader may consult Marchal and Wenzel 2017 and Chakrabarti 2017\nfor overviews of thought on free will, broadly construed, in Chinese\nand Indian philosophical traditions, respectively.) In this way, it\nshould be clear that disputes about free will ineluctably involve\ndisputes about metaphysics and ethics. In ferreting out the kind of\ncontrol at stake in free will, we are forced to consider questions\nabout (among others) causation, laws of nature, time, substance,\nontological reduction vs emergence, the relationship of causal and\nreasons-based explanations, the nature of motivation and more\ngenerally of human persons. In assessing the significance of free\nwill, we are forced to consider questions about (among others)\nrightness and wrongness, good and evil, virtue and vice, blame and\npraise, reward and punishment, and desert. The topic of free will also\ngives rise to purely empirical questions that are beginning to be\nexplored in the human sciences: do we have it, and to what degree?\n\nHere is an overview of what follows. In Section 1, we\nacquaint the reader with some central historical contributions to our\nunderstanding of free will. (As nearly every major and minor figure\nhad something to say about it, we cannot begin to cover them all.) As\nwith contributions to many other foundational topics, these ideas are\nnot of \u2018merely historical interest\u2019: present-day\nphilosophers continue to find themselves drawn back to certain\nthinkers as they freshly engage their contemporaries. In Section\n2, we map the complex architecture of the contemporary discussion\nof the nature of free will by dividing it into five subtopics: its\nrelation to moral responsibility; the proper analysis of the freedom\nto do otherwise; a powerful, recent argument that the freedom to do\notherwise (at least in one important sense) is not necessary\nfor moral responsibility; \u2018compatibilist\u2019 accounts of\nsourcehood or self-determination; and \u2018incompatibilist\u2019 or\n\u2018libertarian\u2019 accounts of source and self-determination.\nIn Section 3, we consider arguments from experience, a priori\nreflection, and various scientific findings and theories for and\nagainst the thesis that human beings have free will, along with the\nrelated question of whether it is reasonable to believe that we have\nit. Finally, in Section 4, we survey the long-debated\nquestions involving free will that arise in classical theistic\nmetaphysics.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Major Historical Contributions\n1.1 Ancient and Medieval Period\n\nOne finds scholarly debate on the \u2018origin\u2019 of the notion\nof free will in Western philosophy. (See, e.g., Dihle (1982) and, in\nresponse Frede (2011), with Dihle finding it in St. Augustine\n(354\u2013430 CE) and Frede in the Stoic Epictetus (c. 55\u2013c.\n135 CE).) But this debate presupposes a fairly particular and highly\nconceptualized concept of free will, with Dihle\u2019s later\n\u2018origin\u2019 reflecting his having a yet more particular\nconcept in view than Frede. If, instead, we look more generally for\nphilosophical reflection on choice-directed control over one\u2019s\nown actions, then we find significant discussion in Plato and\nAristotle (cf. Irwin 1992). Indeed, on this matter, as with so many\nother major philosophical issues, Plato and Aristotle give importantly\ndifferent emphases that inform much subsequent thought.\n\nIn Book IV of The Republic, Plato posits rational, spirited,\nand appetitive aspects to the human soul. The wise person strives for\ninner \u2018justice\u2019, a condition in which each part of the\nsoul plays its proper role\u2014reason as the guide, the spirited\nnature as the ally of reason, exhorting oneself to do what reason\ndeems proper, and the passions as subjugated to the determinations of\nreason. In the absence of justice, the individual is enslaved to the\npassions. Hence, freedom for Plato is a kind of self-mastery, attained\nby developing the virtues of wisdom, courage, and temperance,\nresulting in one\u2019s liberation from the tyranny of base desires\nand acquisition of a more accurate understanding and resolute pursuit\nof the Good (Hecht 2014).\n\nWhile Aristotle shares with Plato a concern for cultivating virtues,\nhe gives greater theoretical attention to the role of choice in\ninitiating individual actions which, over time, result in habits, for\ngood or ill. In Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle\nsays that, unlike nonrational agents, we have the power to do or not\nto do, and much of what we do is voluntary, such that its origin is\n\u2018in us\u2019 and we are \u2018aware of the particular\ncircumstances of the action\u2019. Furthermore, mature humans make\nchoices after deliberating about different available means to our\nends, drawing on rational principles of action. Choose consistently\nwell (poorly), and a virtuous (vicious) character will form over time,\nand it is in our power to be either virtuous or vicious.\n\nA question that Aristotle seems to recognize, while not satisfactorily\nanswering, is whether the choice an individual makes on any given\noccasion is wholly determined by his internal state\u2014perception\nof his circumstances and his relevant beliefs, desires, and general\ncharacter dispositions (wherever on the continuum between virtue and\nvice he may be)\u2014and external circumstances. He says that\n\u201cthe man is the father of his actions as of\nchildren\u201d\u2014that is, a person\u2019s character shapes how\nshe acts. One might worry that this seems to entail that the person\ncould not have done otherwise\u2014at the moment of choice, she has\nno control over what her present character is\u2014and so she is not\nresponsible for choosing as she does. Aristotle responds by contending\nthat her present character is partly a result of previous\nchoices she made. While this claim is plausible enough, it seems to\n\u2018pass the buck\u2019, since \u2018the man is the father\u2019\nof those earlier choices and actions, too.\n\nWe note just a few contributions of the subsequent centuries of the\nHellenistic era. (See Bobzien 1998.) This period was dominated by\ndebates between Epicureans, Stoics, and the Academic Skeptics, and as\nit concerned freedom of the will, the debate centered on the place of\ndeterminism or of fate in governing human actions and lives. The\nStoics and the Epicureans believed that all ordinary things, human\nsouls included, are corporeal and governed by natural laws or\nprinciples. Stoics believed that all human choice and behavior was\ncausally determined, but held that this was compatible with our\nactions being \u2018up to us\u2019. Chrysippus ably defended this\nposition by contending that your actions are \u2018up to you\u2019\nwhen they come about \u2018through you\u2019\u2014when the\ndetermining factors of your action are not external circumstances\ncompelling you to act as you do but are instead your own choices\ngrounded in your perception of the options before you. Hence, for\nmoral responsibility, the issue is not whether one\u2019s choices are\ndetermined (they are) but in what manner they are determined. Epicurus\nand his followers had a more mechanistic conception of bodily action\nthan the Stoics. They held that all things (human soul included) are\nconstituted by atoms, whose law-governed behavior fixes the behavior\nof everything made of such atoms. But they rejected determinism by\nsupposing that atoms, though law-governed, are susceptible to slight\n\u2018swerves\u2019 or departures from the usual paths. Epicurus has\noften been understood as seeking to ground the freedom of human\nwillings in such indeterministic swerves, but this is a matter of\ncontroversy. If this understanding of his aim is correct, how he\nthought that this scheme might work in detail is not known. (What\nlittle we know about his views in this matter stem chiefly from the\naccount given in his follower Lucretius\u2019s six-book poem, On\nthe Nature of Things. See Bobzien 2000 for discussion.)\n\nA final notable figure of this period was\n Alexander of Aphrodisias,\n the most important Peripatetic commentator on Aristotle. In his\nOn Fate, Alexander sharply criticizes the positions of the\nStoics. He goes on to resolve the ambiguity in Aristotle on the\nquestion of the determining nature of character on individual choices\nby maintaining that, given all such shaping factors, it remains open\nto the person when she acts freely to do or not to do what she in fact\ndoes. Many scholars see Alexander as the first unambiguously\n\u2018libertarian\u2019 theorist of the will (for more information\nabout such theories see section 2 below).\n\nAugustine (354\u2013430) is the central bridge between the ancient\nand medieval eras of philosophy. His mature thinking about the will\nwas influenced by his early encounter with late classical Neoplatonist\nthought, which is then transformed by the theological views he\nembraces in his adult Christian conversion, famously recounted in his\nConfessions. In that work and in the earlier On the Free\nChoice of the Will, Augustine struggles to draw together into a\ncoherent whole the doctrines that creaturely misuse of freedom, not\nGod, is the source of evil in the world and that the human will has\nbeen corrupted through the \u2018fall\u2019 from grace of the\nearliest human beings, necessitating a salvation that is attained\nentirely through the actions of God, even as it requires,\nconstitutively, an individual\u2019s willed response of faith. The\ndetails of Augustine\u2019s positive account remain a matter of\ncontroversy. He clearly affirms that the will is by its nature a\nself-determining power\u2014no powers external to it determine its\nchoice\u2014and that this feature is the basis of its freedom. But he\ndoes not explicitly rule out the will\u2019s being internally\ndetermined by psychological factors, as Chrysippus held, and Augustine\nhad theological reasons that might favor (as well as others that would\noppose) the thesis that all things are determined in some manner by\nGod. Scholars divide on whether Augustine was a libertarian or instead\na kind of compatibilist with respect to metaphysical freedom.\n(Macdonald 1999 and Stump 2006 argue the former, Baker 2003 and\nCouenhoven 2007 the latter.) It is clear, however, that Augustine\nthought that we are powerfully shaped by wrongly-ordered desires that\ncan make it impossible for us to wholeheartedly will ends\ncontrary to those desires, for a sustained period of time. This\ncondition entails an absence of something more valuable, \u2018true\nfreedom\u2019, in which our wills are aligned with the Good, a\nfreedom that can be attained only by a transformative operation of\ndivine grace. This latter, psychological conception of freedom of will\nclearly echoes Plato\u2019s notion of the soul\u2019s (possible)\ninner justice.\n\nThomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274) attempted to synthesize major strands\nof Aristotle\u2019s systematic philosophy with Christian theology,\nand so Aquinas begins his complex discussion of human action and\nchoice by agreeing with Aristotle that creatures such as ourselves who\nare endowed with both intellect and will are hardwired to will certain\ngeneral ends ordered to the most general goal of goodness. Will is\nrational desire: we cannot move towards that which does not\nappear to us at the time to be good. Freedom enters the picture when\nwe consider various means to these ends and move ourselves to activity\nin pursuit of certain of them. Our will is free in that it is not\nfixed by nature on any particular means, and they generally do not\nappear to us either as unqualifiedly good or as uniquely satisfying\nthe end we wish to fulfill. Furthermore, what appears to us to be good\ncan vary widely\u2014even, over time, intra-personally. So much is\nconsistent with saying that in a given total circumstance (including\none\u2019s present beliefs and desires), one is necessitated to will\nas one does. For this reason, some commentators have taken Aquinas to\nbe a kind of compatibilist concerning freedom and causal or\ntheological determinism. In his most extended defense of the thesis\nthat the will is not \u2018compelled\u2019 (DM 6), Aquinas\nnotes three ways that the will might reject an option it sees as\nattractive: (i) it finds another option more attractive, (ii) it comes\nto think of some circumstance rendering an alternative more favorable\n\u201cby some chance circumstance, external or internal\u201d, and\n(iii) the person is momentarily disposed to find an alternative\nattractive by virtue of a non-innate state that is subject to the will\n(e.g., being angry vs being at peace). The first consideration is\nclearly consistent with compatibilism. The second at best points to a\nkind of contingency that is not grounded in the activity of the will\nitself. And one wanting to read Aquinas as a libertarian might worry\nthat his third consideration just passes the buck: even if we do\nsometimes have an ability to directly modify perception-coloring\nstates such as moods, Aquinas\u2019s account of will as rational\ndesire seems to indicate that we will do so only if it seems\nto us on balance to be good to do so. Those who read Aquinas as a\nlibertarian point to the following further remark in this text:\n\u201cWill itself can interfere with the process [of some\ncause\u2019s moving the will] either by refusing to consider what\nattracts it to will or by considering its opposite: namely, that there\nis a bad side to what is being proposed\u2026\u201d (Reply to 15;\nsee also DV 24.2). For discussion, see MacDonald (1998), Stump (2003,\nch. 9) and especially Hoffman & Michon (2017), which offers the\nmost comprehensive analysis of relevant texts to date.\n\nJohn Duns Scotus (1265/66\u20131308) was the stoutest defender in the\nmedieval era of a strongly libertarian conception of the will,\nmaintaining on introspective grounds that will by its very nature is\nsuch that \u201cnothing other than the will is the total cause\u201d\nof its activity (QAM). Indeed, he held the unusual view that\nnot only up to but at the very instant that one is willing\nX, it is possible for one to will Y or at least not to will\nX. (He articulates this view through the puzzling claim that a\nsingle instant of time comprises two \u2018instants of nature\u2019,\nat the first but not the second of which alternative possibilities are\npreserved.) In opposition to Aquinas and other medieval Aristotelians,\nScotus maintained that a precondition of our freedom is that there are\ntwo fundamentally distinct ways things can seem good to us: as\npractically advantageous to us or as according with justice. Contrary\nto some popular accounts, however, Scotus allowed that the scope of\navailable alternatives for a person will be more or less constricted.\nHe grants that we are not capable of willing something in which we see\nno good whatsoever, nor of positively repudiating something which\nappears to us as unqualifiedly good. However, in accordance with his\nuncompromising position that nothing can be the total cause of the\nwill other than itself, he held that where something does appear to us\nas unqualifiedly good (perfectly suited both to our advantage and\njustice)\u2014viz., in the \u2018beatific vision\u2019 of God in\nthe afterlife\u2014we still can refrain from willing it. For\ndiscussion, see\n John Duns Scotus, \u00a75.2.\n1.2 Modern Period and Twentieth Century\n\nThe problem of free will was an important topic in the modern period,\nwith all the major figures wading into it (Descartes 1641 [1988], 1644\n[1988]; Hobbes 1654 [1999], 1656 [1999]; Spinoza 1677 [1992];\nMalebranche 1684 [1993]; Leibniz 1686 [1991]; Locke 1690 [1975]; Hume\n1740 [1978], 1748 [1975]; Edwards 1754 [1957]; Kant 1781 [1998], 1785\n[1998], 1788 [2015]; Reid 1788 [1969]). After less sustained attention\nin the 19th Century (most notable were Schopenhauer 1841 [1999] and\nNietzsche 1886 [1966]), it was widely discussed again among early\ntwentieth century philosophers (Moore 1912; Hobart 1934; Schlick 1939;\nNowell-Smith 1948, 1954; Campbell 1951; Ayer 1954; Smart 1961). The\ncentrality of the problem of free will to the various projects of\nearly modern philosophers can be traced to two widely, though not\nuniversally, shared assumptions. The first is that without belief in\nfree will, there would be little reason for us to act morally. More\ncarefully, it was widely assumed that belief in an afterlife in which\na just God rewards and punishes us according to our right or wrong use\nof free will was key to motivating us to be moral (Russell 2008, chs.\n16\u201317). Life before death affords us many examples in which vice\nis better rewarded than virtue and so without knowledge of a final\njudgment in the afterlife, we would have little reason to pursue\nvirtue and justice when they depart from self-interest. And without\nfree will there can be no final judgement.\n\nThe second widely shared assumption is that free will seems difficult\nto reconcile with what we know about the world. While this assumption\nis shared by the majority of early modern philosophers, what\nspecifically it is about the world that seems to conflict with freedom\ndiffers from philosopher to philosopher. For some, the worry is\nprimarily theological. How can we make sense of contingency and\nfreedom in a world determined by a God who must choose the best\npossible world to create? For some, the worry was primarily\nmetaphysical. The principle of sufficient reason\u2014roughly, the\nidea that every event must have a reason or cause\u2014was a\ncornerstone of Leibniz\u2019s and Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics. How\ndoes contingency and freedom fit into such a world? For some, the\nworry was primarily scientific (Descartes). Given that a proper\nunderstanding of the physical world is one in which all physical\nobjects are governed by deterministic laws of nature, how does\ncontingency and freedom fit into such a world? Of course, for some,\nall three worries were in play in their work (this is true especially\nof Leibniz).\n\nDespite many disagreements about how best to solve these worries,\nthere were three claims that were widely, although not universally,\nagreed upon. The first was that free will has two aspects: the freedom\nto do otherwise and the power of self-determination. The second is\nthat an adequate account of free will must entail that free agents are\nmorally responsible agents and/or fit subjects for punishment. Ideas\nabout moral responsibility were often a yard stick by which analyses\nof free will were measured, with critics objecting to an analysis of\nfree will by arguing that agents who satisfied the analysis would not,\nintuitively, be morally responsible for their actions. The third is\nthat compatibilism\u2014the thesis that free will is compatible with\ndeterminism\u2014is true. (Spinoza, Reid, and Kant are the clear\nexceptions to this, though some also see Descartes as an\nincompatibilist [Ragland 2006].)\n\nSince a detailed discussion of these philosophers\u2019 accounts of\nfree will would take us too far afield, we want instead to focus on\nisolating a two-step strategy for defending compatibilism that emerges\nin the early modern period and continued to exert considerable force\ninto the early twentieth century (and perhaps is still at work today).\nAdvocates of this two-step strategy have come to be known as\n\u201cclassical compatibilists\u201d. The first step was to argue\nthat the contrary of freedom is not determinism but external\nconstraint on doing what one wants to do. For example, Hobbes contends\nthat liberty is \u201cthe absence of all the impediments to action\nthat are not contained in the nature and intrinsical quality of the\nagent\u201d (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 38; cf. Hume 1748 [1975] VIII.1;\nEdwards 1754 [1957]; Ayer 1954). This idea led many compatibilists,\nespecially the more empiricist-inclined, to develop desire- or\npreference-based analyses of both the freedom to do otherwise and\nself-determination. An agent has the freedom to do otherwise than\n\\(\\phi\\) just in case if she preferred or willed to\ndo otherwise, she would have done otherwise (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 16;\nLocke 1690 [1975]) II.xx.8; Hume 1748 [1975] VIII.1; Moore 1912; Ayer\n1954). The freedom to do otherwise does not require that you are able\nto act contrary to your strongest motivation but simply that your\naction be dependent on your strongest motivation in the sense that\nhad you desired something else more strongly, then you would\nhave pursued that alternative end. (We will discuss this analysis in\nmore detail below in section 2.2.) Similarly, an agent self-determines\nher \\(\\phi\\)-ing just in case \\(\\phi\\) is caused by her strongest\ndesires or preferences at the time of action (Hobbes\n1654 [1999]; Locke 1690 [1975]; Edwards 1754 [1957]). (We will discuss\nthis analysis in more detail below in section 2.4.) Given these\nanalyses, determinism seems innocuous to freedom.\n\nThe second step was to argue that any attempt to analyze free will in\na way that putatively captures a deeper or more robust sense of\nfreedom leads to intractable conundrums. The most important examples\nof this attempt to capture a deeper sense of freedom in the modern\nperiod are Immanuel Kant (1781 [1998], 1785 [1998], 1788 [2015]) and\nThomas Reid (1788 [1969]) and in the early twentieth century C. A.\nCampbell (1951). These philosophers argued that the above\ncompatibilist analyses of the freedom to do otherwise and\nself-determination are, at best, insufficient for free will, and, at\nworst, incompatible with it. With respect to the classical\ncompatibilist analysis of the freedom to do otherwise, these critics\nargued that the freedom to do otherwise requires not just that an\nagent could have acted differently if he had willed\ndifferently, but also that he could have willed differently.\nFree will requires more than free action. With respect to classical\ncompatibilists\u2019 analysis of self-determination, they argued that\nself-determination requires that the agent\u2014rather than his\ndesires, preferences, or any other mental state\u2014cause his free\nchoices and actions. Reid explains:\n\n\nI consider the determination of the will as an effect. This effect\nmust have a cause which had the power to produce it; and the cause\nmust be either the person himself, whose will it is, or some other\nbeing\u2026. If the person was the cause of that determination of\nhis own will, he was free in that action, and it is justly imputed to\nhim, whether it be good or bad. But, if another being was the cause of\nthis determination, either producing it immediately, or by means and\ninstruments under his direction, then the determination is the act and\ndeed of that being, and is solely imputed to him. (1788 [1969] IV.i,\n265)\n\n\nClassical compatibilists argued that both claims are incoherent. While\nit is intelligible to ask whether a man willed to do what he did, it\nis incoherent to ask whether a man willed to will what he did:\n\n\nFor to ask whether a man is at liberty to will either motion or rest,\nspeaking or silence, which he pleases, is to ask whether a man can\nwill what he wills, or be pleased with what he is\npleased with? A question which, I think, needs no answer; and they who\nmake a question of it must suppose one will to determine the acts of\nanother, and another to determine that, and so on in\ninfinitum. (Locke 1690 [1975] II.xx.25; cf. Hobbes 1656 [1999],\n72)\n\n\nIn response to libertarians\u2019 claim that self-determination\nrequires that the agent, rather than his motives, cause his actions,\nit was objected that this removes the agent from the natural causal\norder, which is clearly unintelligible for human animals (Hobbes 1654\n[1999], 38). It is important to recognize that an implication of the\nsecond step of the strategy is that free will is not only compatible\nwith determinism but actually requires determinism (cf. Hume 1748\n[1975] VIII). This was a widely shared assumption among compatibilists\nup through the mid-twentieth century.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s Ethics (1677 [1992]) is an important\ndeparture from the above dialectic. He endorses a strong form of\nnecessitarianism in which everything is categorically necessary as\nopposed to the conditional necessity embraced by most compatibilists,\nand he contends that there is no room in such a world for divine or\ncreaturely free will. Thus, Spinoza is a free will skeptic.\nInterestingly, Spinoza is also keen to deny that the nonexistence of\nfree will has the dire implications often assumed. As noted above,\nmany in the modern period saw belief in free will and an afterlife in\nwhich God rewards the just and punishes the wicked as necessary to\nmotivate us to act morally. According to Spinoza, so far from this\nbeing necessary to motivate us to be moral, it actually distorts our\npursuit of morality. True moral living, Spinoza thinks, sees virtue as\nits own reward (Part V, Prop. 42). Moreover, while free will is a\nchimera, humans are still capable of freedom or self-determination.\nSuch self-determination, which admits of degrees on Spinoza\u2019s\nview, arises when our emotions are determined by true ideas about the\nnature of reality. The emotional lives of the free persons are ones in\nwhich \u201cwe desire nothing but that which must be, nor, in an\nabsolute sense, can we find contentment in anything but truth. And so\nin so far as we rightly understand these matters, the endeavor of the\nbetter part of us is in harmony with the order of the whole of\nNature\u201d (Part IV, Appendix). Spinoza is an important forerunner\nto the many free will skeptics in the twentieth century, a position\nthat continues to attract strong support (see Strawson 1986; Double\n1992; Smilansky 2000; Pereboom 2001, 2014; Levy 2011; Waller 2011;\nCaruso 2012; Vilhauer 2012. For further discussion see the entry\n skepticism about moral responsibility).\n\nIt is worth observing that in many of these disputes about the nature\nof free will there is an underlying dispute about the nature of moral\nresponsibility. This is seen clearly in Hobbes (1654 [1999]) and early\ntwentieth century philosophers\u2019 defenses of compatibilism.\nUnderlying the belief that free will is incompatible with determinism\nis the thought that no one would be morally responsible for any\nactions in a deterministic world in the sense that no one would\ndeserve blame or punishment. Hobbes responded to this charge\nin part by endorsing broadly consequentialist justifications of blame\nand punishment: we are justified in blaming or punishing because these\npractices deter future harmful actions and/or contribute to reforming\nthe offender (1654 [1999], 24\u201325; cf. Schlick 1939; Nowell-Smith\n1948; Smart 1961). While many, perhaps even most, compatibilists have\ncome to reject this consequentialist approach to moral responsibility\nin the wake of P. F. Strawson\u2019s 1962 landmark essay\n\u2018Freedom and Resentment\u2019 (though see Vargas (2013) and\nMcGeer (2014) for contemporary defenses of compatibilism that appeal\nto forward-looking considerations) there is still a general lesson to\nbe learned: disputes about free will are often a function of\nunderlying disputes about the nature and value of moral\nresponsibility.\n2. The Nature of Free Will\n2.1 Free Will and Moral Responsibility\n\nAs should be clear from this short discussion of the history of the\nidea of free will, free will has traditionally been conceived of as a\nkind of power to control one\u2019s choices and actions. When an\nagent exercises free will over her choices and actions, her choices\nand actions are up to her. But up to her in what sense? As\nshould be clear from our historical survey, two common (and\ncompatible) answers are: (i) up to her in the sense that she is able\nto choose otherwise, or at minimum that she is able not to choose or\nact as she does, and (ii) up to her in the sense that she is the\nsource of her action. However, there is widespread controversy both\nover whether each of these conditions is required for free will and if\nso, how to understand the kind or sense of freedom to do otherwise or\nsourcehood that is required. While some seek to resolve these\ncontroversies in part by careful articulation of our experiences of\ndeliberation, choice, and action (Nozick 1981, ch. 4; van Inwagen\n1983, ch. 1), many seek to resolve these\ncontroversies by appealing to the nature of moral responsibility. The\nidea is that the kind of control or sense of up-to-meness involved in\nfree will is the kind of control or sense of up-to-meness relevant to\nmoral responsibility (Double 1992, 12; Ekstrom 2000, 7\u20138;\nSmilansky 2000, 16; Widerker and McKenna 2003, 2; Vargas 2007, 128;\nNelkin 2011, 151\u201352; Levy 2011, 1; Pereboom 2014, 1\u20132).\nIndeed, some go so far as to define \u2018free will\u2019 as\n\u2018the strongest control condition\u2014whatever that turns out\nto be\u2014necessary for moral responsibility\u2019 (Wolf 1990,\n3\u20134; Fischer 1994, 3; Mele 2006, 17). Given this connection, we\ncan determine whether the freedom to do otherwise and the power of\nself-determination are constitutive of free will and, if so, in what\nsense, by considering what it takes to be a morally responsible agent.\nOn these latter characterizations of free will, understanding free\nwill is inextricably linked to, and perhaps even derivative from,\nunderstanding moral responsibility. And even those who demur from this\nclaim regarding conceptual priority typically see a close link between\nthese two ideas. Consequently, to appreciate the current debates\nsurrounding the nature of free will, we need to say something about\nthe nature of moral responsibility.\n\nIt is now widely accepted that there are different species of moral\nresponsibility. It is common (though not uncontroversial) to\ndistinguish moral responsibility as answerability from moral\nresponsibility as attributability from moral responsibility\nas accountability (Watson 1996; Fischer and Tognazzini 2011;\nShoemaker 2011. See Smith (2012) for a critique of this taxonomy).\nThese different species of moral responsibility differ along three\ndimensions: (i) the kind of responses licensed toward the responsible\nagent, (ii) the nature of the licensing relation, and (iii) the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for licensing the relevant kind of\nresponses toward the agent. For example, some argue that when an agent\nis morally responsible in the attributability sense, certain\njudgments about the agent\u2014such as judgments concerning\nthe virtues and vices of the agent\u2014are fitting, and\nthat the fittingness of such judgments does not depend on whether the\nagent in question possessed the freedom to do otherwise (cf. Watson\n1996).\n\nWhile keeping this controversy about the nature of moral\nresponsibility firmly in mind (see the entry on\n moral responsibility\n for a more detailed discussion of these issues), we think it is fair\nto say that the most commonly assumed understanding of moral\nresponsibility in the historical and contemporary discussion of the\nproblem of free will is moral responsibility as\naccountability in something like the following sense:\n\nAn agent \\(S\\) is morally accountable for performing an action\n\\(\\phi\\) \\(=_{df.}\\) \\(S\\) deserves praise if \\(\\phi\\) goes beyond\nwhat can be reasonably expected of \\(S\\) and \\(S\\) deserves blame if\n\\(\\phi\\) is morally wrong.\n\nThe central notions in this definition are praise,\nblame, and desert. The majority of contemporary\nphilosophers have followed Strawson (1962) in contending that praising\nand blaming an agent consist in experiencing (or at least being\ndisposed to experience (cf. Wallace 1994, 70\u201371)) reactive\nattitudes or emotions directed toward the agent, such as gratitude,\napprobation, and pride in the case of praise, and resentment,\nindignation, and guilt in the case of blame. (See Sher (2006) and\nScanlon (2008) for important dissents from this trend. See the entry\non\n blame\n for a more detailed discussion.) These emotions, in turn, dispose us\nto act in a variety of ways. For example, blame disposes us to respond\nwith some kind of hostility toward the blameworthy agent, such as\nverbal rebuke or partial withdrawal of good will. But while these\nkinds of dispositions are essential to our blaming someone, their\nmanifestation is not: it is possible to blame someone with very little\nchange in attitudes or actions toward the agent. Blaming someone might\nbe immediately followed by forgiveness as an end of the matter.\n\nBy \u2018desert\u2019, we have in mind what Derk Pereboom has called\nbasic desert:\n\n\nThe desert at issue here is basic in the sense that the agent would\ndeserve to be blamed or praised just because she has performed the\naction, given an understanding of its moral status, and not, for\nexample, merely by virtue of consequentialist or contractualist\nconsiderations. (2014, 2)\n\n\nAs we understand desert, if an agent deserves blame, then we have a\nstrong pro tanto reason to blame him simply in virtue of his\nbeing accountable for doing wrong. Importantly, these reasons can be\noutweighed by other considerations. While an agent may deserve blame,\nit might, all things considered, be best to forgive him\nunconditionally instead.\n\nWhen an agent is morally responsible for doing something wrong, he is\nblameworthy: he deserves hard treatment marked by resentment\nand indignation and the actions these emotions dispose us toward, such\nas censure, rebuke, and ostracism. However, it would seem unfair to\ntreat agents in these ways unless their actions were up to\nthem. Thus, we arrive at the core connection between free will\nand moral responsibility: agents deserve praise or blame only if their\nactions are up to them\u2014only if they have free will.\nConsequently, we can assess analyses of free will by their\nimplications for judgments of moral responsibility. We note that some\nmight reject the claim that free will is necessary for moral\nresponsibility (e.g., Frankfurt 1971; Stump 1988), but even for these\ntheorists an adequate analysis of free will must specify a\nsufficient condition for the kind of control at play in moral\nresponsibility.\n\nIn what follows, we focus our attention on the two most commonly cited\nfeatures of free will: the freedom to do otherwise and sourcehood.\nWhile some seem to think that free will consists exclusively in either\nthe freedom to do otherwise (van Inwagen 2008) or in sourcehood\n(Zagzebski 2000), many philosophers hold that free will involves both\nconditions\u2014though philosophers often emphasize one condition\nover the other depending on their dialectical situation or\nargumentative purposes (cf. Watson 1987). In what follows, we will\ndescribe the most common characterizations of these two\nconditions.\n2.2 The Freedom to Do Otherwise\n\nFor most newcomers to the problem of free will, it will seem obvious\nthat an action is up to an agent only if she had the freedom to do\notherwise. But what does this freedom come to? The freedom to do\notherwise is clearly a modal property of agents, but it is\ncontroversial just what species of modality is at stake. It must be\nmore than mere possibility: to have the freedom to do\notherwise consists in more than the mere possibility of something\nelse\u2019s happening. A more plausible and widely endorsed\nunderstanding claims the relevant modality is ability or\npower (Locke 1690 [1975], II.xx; Reid 1788 [1969],\nII.i\u2013ii; D. Locke 1973; Clarke 2009; Vihvelin 2013). But\nabilities themselves seem to come in different varieties (Lewis 1976;\nHorgan 1979; van Inwagen 1983, ch. 1; Mele 2003; Clarke 2009; Vihvelin\n2013, ch. 1; Franklin 2015; Cyr and Swenson 2019; Hofmann 2022;\nWhittle 2022), so a claim that an agent has \u2018the ability to do\notherwise\u2019 is potentially ambiguous or indeterminate; in\nphilosophical discussion, the sense of ability appealed to needs to be\nspelled out. A satisfactory account of the freedom to do otherwise\nowes us both an account of the kind of ability in terms of which the\nfreedom to do otherwise is analyzed, and an argument for why this kind\nof ability (as opposed to some other species) is the one constitutive\nof the freedom to do otherwise. As we will see, philosophers sometimes\nleave this second debt unpaid.\n\nThe contemporary literature takes its cue from classical\ncompatibilism\u2019s recognized failure to deliver a satisfactory\nanalysis of the freedom to do otherwise. As we saw above, classical\ncompatibilists (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 1656 [1999]; Locke 1690 [1975];\nHume 1740 [1978], 1748 [1975]; Edwards 1754 [1957]; Moore 1912;\nSchlick 1939; Ayer 1954) sought to analyze the freedom to do otherwise\nin terms of a simple conditional analysis of ability:\n\nSimple Conditional Analysis: An agent \\(S\\) has the\nability to do otherwise if and only if, were \\(S\\) to choose to do\notherwise, then \\(S\\) would do otherwise.\n\n\nPart of the attraction of this analysis is that it obviously\nreconciles the freedom to do otherwise with determinism. While the\ntruth of determinism entails that one\u2019s action is inevitable\ngiven the past and laws of nature, there is nothing about determinism\nthat implies that if one had chosen otherwise, then one would\nnot do otherwise.\n\nThere are two problems with the Simple Conditional\nAnalysis. The first is that it is, at best, an analysis of\nfree action, not free will (cf. Reid 1788 [1969]; Chisholm 1966; 1976,\nch. 2; Lehrer 1968, 1976). It only tells us when an agent has the\nability to do otherwise, not when an agent has the ability to\nchoose to do otherwise. One might be tempted to think that\nthere is an easy fix along the following lines:\n\nSimple Conditional Analysis*: An agent \\(S\\) has the\nability to choose otherwise if and only if, were \\(S\\) to desire or\nprefer to choose otherwise, then \\(S\\) would choose otherwise.\n\n\nThe problem is that we often fail to choose to do things we want to\nchoose, even when it appears that we had the ability to choose\notherwise (one might think the same problem attends the original\nanalysis). Suppose that, in deciding how to spend my evening, I have a\ndesire to choose to read and a desire to choose to watch a movie.\nSuppose that I choose to read. By all appearances, I had the ability\nto choose to watch a movie. And yet, according to the Simple\nConditional Analysis*, I lack this freedom, since the\nconditional \u2018if I were to desire to choose to watch a movie,\nthen I would choose to watch a movie\u2019 is false. I do desire to\nchoose to watch a movie and yet I do not choose to watch a movie. It\nis unclear how to remedy this problem. On the one hand, we might\nrefine the antecedent by replacing \u2018desire\u2019 with\n\u2018strongest desire\u2019 (cf. Hobbes 1654 [1999], 1656 [1999];\nEdwards 1754 [1957]). The problem is that this assumes, implausibly,\nthat we always choose what we most strongly desire (for criticisms of\nthis view see Reid 1788 [1969]; Campbell 1951; Wallace 1999; Holton\n2009). On the other hand, we might refine the consequent by replacing\n\u2018would choose to do otherwise\u2019 with either \u2018would\nprobably choose to do otherwise\u2019 or \u2018might choose to do\notherwise\u2019. But each of these proposals is also problematic. If\n\u2018probably\u2019 means \u2018more likely than not\u2019, then\nthis revised conditional still seems too strong: it seems possible to\nhave the ability to choose otherwise even when one\u2019s so choosing\nis unlikely. If we opt for \u2018might\u2019, then the relevant\nsense of modality needs to be spelled out.\n\nEven if there are fixes to these problems, there is a yet deeper\nproblem with these analyses. There are some agents who clearly lack\nthe freedom to do otherwise and yet satisfy the conditional at the\nheart of these analyses. That is, although these agents lack the\nfreedom to do otherwise, it is, for example, true of them that\nif they chose otherwise, they would do otherwise. Picking up\non an argument developed by Keith Lehrer (1968; cf. Campbell 1951;\nBroad 1952; Chisholm 1966), consider an agoraphobic, Luke, who, when\nfaced with the prospect of entering an open space, is subject not\nmerely to an irresistible desire to refrain from intentionally going\noutside, but an irresistible desire to refrain from even\nchoosing to go outside. Given Luke\u2019s psychology, there\nis no possible world in which he suffers from his agoraphobia and\nchooses to go outside. It may well nevertheless be true that\nif Luke chose to go outside, then he would have gone outside.\nAfter all, any possible world in which he chooses to go outside will\nbe a world in which he no longer suffers (to the same degree) from his\nagoraphobia, and thus we have no reason to doubt that in those worlds\nhe would go outside as a result of his choosing to go outside. The\nsame kind of counterexample applies with equal force to the\nconditional \u2018if \\(S\\) desired to choose otherwise, then \\(S\\)\nwould choose otherwise\u2019.\n\nWhile simple conditional analyses admirably make clear the species of\nability to which they appeal, they fail to show that this species of\nability is constitutive of the freedom to do otherwise. Agents need a\nstronger ability to do otherwise than characterized by such simple\nconditionals. Some argue that the fundamental source of the above\nproblems is the conditional nature of these analyses\n(Campbell 1951; Austin 1961; Chisholm 1966; Lehrer 1976; van Inwagen\n1983, ch. 4). The sense of ability relevant to the freedom to do\notherwise is the \u2018all-in sense\u2019\u2014that is, holding\neverything fixed up to the time of the decision or action\u2014and\nthis sense, so it is argued, can only be captured by a categorical\nanalysis of the ability to do otherwise:\n\nCategorical Analysis: An agent \\(S\\) has the ability\nto choose or do otherwise than \\(\\phi\\) at time \\(t\\) if and only if\nit was possible, holding fixed everything up to \\(t\\), that \\(S\\)\nchoose or do otherwise than \\(\\phi\\) at \\(t\\).\n\n\nThis analysis gets the right verdict in Luke\u2019s case. He lacks\nthe ability to do otherwise than refrain from choosing to go outside,\naccording to this analysis, because there is no possible world in\nwhich he suffers from his agoraphobia and yet chooses to go outside.\nUnlike the above conditional analyses, the Categorical\nAnalysis requires that we hold fixed Luke\u2019s agoraphobia\nwhen considering alternative possibilities.\n\nIf the Categorical Analysis is correct, then free\nwill is incompatible with determinism. According to the thesis of\ndeterminism, all deterministic possible worlds with the same pasts and\nlaws of nature have the same futures (Lewis 1979; van Inwagen 1983,\n3). Suppose John is in deterministic world \\(W\\) and refrains from\nraising his hand at time \\(t\\). Since \\(W\\) is deterministic, it\nfollows that any possible world \\(W^*\\) that has the same past and\nlaws up to \\(t\\) must have the same future, including John\u2019s\nrefraining from raising his hand at \\(t\\). Therefore, John lacked the\nability, and thus freedom, to raise his hand.\n\nThis argument, carefully articulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s\nby Carl Ginet (1966, 1990) and Peter van Inwagen (1975, 1983) and\nrefined in important ways by John Martin Fischer (1994), has come to\nbe known as the Consequence Argument. van Inwagen offers the following\ninformal statement of the argument:\n\n\nIf determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws\nof nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what\nwent on before we were born [i.e., we do not have the ability to\nchange the past], and neither is it up to us what the laws of nature\nare [i.e., we do not have the ability to break the laws of nature].\nTherefore, the consequences of these things (including our present\nacts) are not up to us. (van Inwagen 1983, 16; cf. Fischer 1994, ch.\n1)\n\n\nLike the Simple Conditional Analysis, a virtue of the\nCategorical Analysis is that it spells out clearly\nthe kind of ability appealed to in its analysis of the freedom to do\notherwise, but like the Simple Conditional Analysis,\ncritics have argued that the sense of ability it captures is not the\nsense at the heart of free will. The objection here, though, is not\nthat the analysis is too permissive or weak, but rather that it is too\nrestrictive or strong.\n\nWhile there have been numerous different replies along these lines\n(e.g., Lehrer 1980; Slote 1982; Watson 1986. See the entry on\n arguments for incompatibilism\n for a more extensive discussion of and bibliography for the\nConsequence Argument), the most influential of these objections is due\nto David Lewis (1981). Lewis contended that van Inwagen\u2019s\nargument equivocated on \u2018is able to break a law of\nnature\u2019. We can distinguish two senses of \u2018is able to\nbreak a law of nature\u2019:\n\n(Weak Thesis) I am able to do something such that, if I did it, a law\nof nature would be broken.\n\n(Strong Thesis) I am able to do something such that, if I did it, it\nwould constitute a law of nature\u2019s being broken or would cause a\nlaw of nature to be broken.\n\nIf we are committed to the Categorical Analysis, then\nthose desiring to defend compatibilism seem to be committed to the\nsense of ability in \u2018is able to break a law of nature\u2019\nalong the lines of the strong thesis. Lewis agrees with van Inwagen\nthat it is \u201cincredible\u201d to think humans have such an\nability (Lewis 1981, 113), but maintains that compatibilists need only\nappeal to the ability to break a law of nature in the weak sense.\nWhile it is absurd to think that humans are able to do something that\nis a violation of a law of nature or causes a law of\nnature to be broken, there is nothing incredible, so Lewis claimed, in\nthinking that humans are able to do something such that if\nthey did it, a law of nature would be broken. In essence, Lewis is\narguing that incompatibilists like van Inwagen have failed to\nadequately motivate the restrictiveness of the Categorical\nAnalysis.\n\nSome incompatibilists have responded to Lewis by contending that even\nthe weak ability is incredible (van Inwagen\n2004). But there is a different and often overlooked problem for\nLewis: the weak ability seems to be too weak. Returning to the case of\nJohn\u2019s refraining from raising his hand, Lewis maintains that\nthe following three propositions are consistent:\n\n(i)\nJohn is able to raise his hand.\n(ii)\nA necessary condition for John\u2019s raising his hand fails to\nobtain (i.e., that the laws of nature or past are different than they\nactually are).\n(iii)\nJohn is not able to do anything that would constitute this\nnecessary condition\u2019s obtaining or cause this necessary\ncondition to obtain (i.e., he is unable to do anything that would\nconstitute or cause a law of nature to be broken or the past to be\ndifferent).\n\n\nOne might think that (ii) and (iii) are incompatible with (i).\nConsider again Luke, our agoraphobic. Suppose that his agoraphobia\naffects him in such a way that he will only intentionally go outside\nif he chooses to go outside, and yet his agoraphobia makes it\nimpossible for him to make this choice. In this case, a necessary\ncondition for Luke\u2019s intentionally going outside is his choosing\nto go outside. Moreover, Luke is not able to choose or cause himself\nto choose to go outside. Intuitively, this would seem to imply that\nLuke lacks the freedom to go outside. But this implication\ndoes not follow for Lewis. From the fact that Luke is able to go\noutside only if he chooses to go outside and the fact that Luke is not\nable to choose to go outside, it does not follow, on\nLewis\u2019s account, that Luke lacks the ability to go outside.\nConsequently, Lewis\u2019s account fails to explain why Luke lacks\nthe ability to go outside (cf. Speak 2011). (For other important\ncriticisms of Lewis, see Ginet [1990, ch. 5] and Fischer [1994, ch.\n4].)\n\nWhile Lewis may be right that the Categorical\nAnalysis is too restrictive, his argument, all by itself,\ndoesn\u2019t seem to establish this. His argument is successful only\nif (a) he can provide an alternative analysis of ability that entails\nthat Luke\u2019s agoraphobia robs him of the ability to go outside\nand (b) does not entail that determinism robs John of the ability to\nraise his hand (cf. Pendergraft 2010). Lewis must point out a\nprincipled difference between these two cases. As should be clear from\nthe above, the Simple Conditional Analysis is of no\nhelp. However, some recent work by Michael Smith (2003), Kadri\nVihvelin (2004; 2013), and Michael Fara (2008) have attempted to fill\nthis gap. What unites these theorists\u2014whom Clarke (2009) has\ncalled the \u2018new dispositionalists\u2019\u2014is their attempt\nto appeal to recent advances in the metaphysics of dispositions to\narrive at a revised conditional analysis of the freedom to do\notherwise. The most perspicuous of these accounts is offered by\nVihvelin (2004), who argues that an agent\u2019s having the ability\nto do otherwise is solely a function of the agent\u2019s intrinsic\nproperties. (It is important to note that Vihvelin [2013] has come to\nreject the view that free will consists exclusively in the kind of\nability analyzed below.) Building on Lewis\u2019s work on the\nmetaphysics of dispositions, she arrives at the following analysis of\nability:\n\nRevised Conditional Analysis of Ability: \\(S\\) has\nthe ability at time \\(t\\) to do \\(X\\) iff, for some intrinsic property\nor set of properties \\(B\\) that \\(S\\) has at \\(t\\), for some time\n\\(t'\\) after \\(t\\), if \\(S\\) chose (decided, intended, or tried) at\n\\(t\\) to do \\(X\\), and \\(S\\) were to retain \\(B\\) until \\(t'\\),\n\\(S\\)\u2019s choosing (deciding, intending, or trying) to do \\(X\\)\nand \\(S\\)\u2019s having \\(B\\) would jointly be an \\(S\\)-complete\ncause of \\(S\\)\u2019s doing \\(X\\). (Vihvelin 2004, 438)\n\n\nLewis defines an \u2018\\(S\\)-complete cause\u2019 as \u201ca cause\ncomplete insofar as havings of properties intrinsic to [\\(S\\)] are\nconcerned, though perhaps omitting some events extrinsic to\n[\\(S\\)]\u201d (cf. Lewis 1997, 156). In other words, an\n\\(S\\)-complete cause of \\(S\\)\u2019s doing \\(\\phi\\) requires that\n\\(S\\) possess all the intrinsic properties relevant to \\(S\\)\u2019s\ncausing \\(S\\)\u2019s doing \\(\\phi\\). This analysis appears to afford\nVihvelin the basis for a principled difference between agoraphobics\nand merely determined agents. We must hold fixed an agent\u2019s\nphobias since they are intrinsic properties of agents, but we need not\nhold fixed the laws of nature because these are not intrinsic\nproperties of agents. (It should be noted that the assumption that\nintrinsic properties are wholly separable from the laws of nature is\ndisputed by \u2018dispositional essentialists.\u2019 See the entry\non\n metaphysics of causation.)\n Vihvelin\u2019s analysis appears to be restrictive enough to exclude\nphobics from having the freedom to do otherwise, but permissive enough\nto allow that some agents in deterministic worlds have the freedom to\ndo otherwise.\n\nBut appearances can be deceiving. The new dispositionalist claims have\nreceived some serious criticism, with the majority of the criticisms\nmaintaining that these analyses are still too permissive (Clarke 2009;\nWhittle 2010; Franklin 2011b). For example, Randolph Clarke argues\nthat Vihvelin\u2019s analysis fails to overcome the original problem\nwith the Simple Conditional Analysis. He writes,\n\u201cA phobic agent might, on some occasion, be unable to choose to\nA and unable to A without so choosing, while\nretaining all that she would need to implement such a choice, should\nshe make it. Despite lacking the ability to choose to A, the\nagent might have some set of intrinsic properties B such\nthat, if she chose to A and retained B, then her\nchoosing to A and her having B would jointly be an\nagent-complete cause of her A-ing\u201d (Clarke 2009, p.\n329).\n\nThe Categorical Analysis, and thus incompatibilism\nabout free will and determinism, remains an attractive option for many\nphilosophers precisely because it seems that compatibilists have yet\nto furnish an analysis of the freedom to do otherwise that implies\nthat phobics clearly lack the ability to choose or do otherwise that\nis relevant to moral responsibility and yet some merely determined\nagents have this ability.\n2.3 Freedom to Do Otherwise vs. Sourcehood Accounts\n\nSome have tried to avoid these lingering problems for compatibilists\nby arguing that the freedom to do otherwise is not required for free\nwill or moral responsibility. What matters for an agent\u2019s\nfreedom and responsibility, so it is argued, is the source of\nher action\u2014how her action was brought about. The most prominent\nstrategy for defending this move appeals to \u2018Frankfurt-style\ncases\u2019. In a ground-breaking article, Harry Frankfurt (1969)\npresented a series of thought experiments intended to show that it is\npossible that agents are morally responsible for their actions and yet\nthey lack the ability to do otherwise. While Frankfurt (1971) took\nthis to show that moral responsibility and free will come\napart\u2014free will requires the ability to do otherwise but moral\nresponsibility does not\u2014if we define \u2018free will\u2019 as\n\u2018the strongest control condition required for moral\nresponsibility\u2019 (cf. Wolf 1990, 3\u20134; Fischer 1994, 3; Mele\n2006, 17), then if Frankfurt-style cases show that moral\nresponsibility does not require the ability to do otherwise, then they\nalso show that free will does not require the ability to do otherwise.\nLet us consider this challenge in more detail.\n\nHere is a representative Frankfurt-style case:\n\nImagine, if you will, that Black is a quite nifty (and even generally\nnice) neurosurgeon. But in performing an operation on Jones to remove\na brain tumor, Black inserts a mechanism into Jones\u2019s brain\nwhich enables Black to monitor and control Jones\u2019s activities.\nJones, meanwhile, knows nothing of this. Black exercises this control\nthrough a sophisticated computer which he has programmed so that,\namong other things, it monitors Jones\u2019s voting behavior. If\nJones were to show any inclination to vote for Bush, then the\ncomputer, through the mechanism in Jones\u2019s brain, intervenes to\nensure that he actually decides to vote for Clinton and does so vote.\nBut if Jones decides on his own to vote for Clinton, the computer does\nnothing but continue to monitor\u2014without affecting\u2014the\ngoings-on in Jones\u2019s head. (Fischer 2006, 38)\n\n\nFischer goes on to suppose that Jones \u201cdecides to vote for\nClinton on his own\u201d, without any interference from Black, and\nmaintains that in such a case Jones is morally responsible for his\ndecision. Fischer draws two interrelated conclusions from this case.\nThe first, negative conclusion, is that the ability to do otherwise is\nnot necessary for moral responsibility. Jones is unable to refrain\nfrom deciding to vote for Clinton, and yet, so long as Jones decides\nto vote for Clinton on his own, his decision is free and one for which\nhe is morally responsible. The second, positive conclusion, is that\nfreedom and responsibility are functions of the actual\nsequence. What matters for an agent\u2019s freedom and moral\nresponsibility is not what might have happened, but how his action was\nactually brought about. What matters is not whether the agent had the\nability to do otherwise, but whether he was the source of his\nactions.\n\nThe success of Frankfurt-style cases is hotly contested. An early and\nfar-reaching criticism is due to David Widerker (1995), Carl Ginet\n(1996), and Robert Kane (1996, 142\u201343). According to this\ncriticism, proponents of Frankfurt-style cases face a dilemma: either\nthese cases assume that the connection between the indicator (in our\ncase, the absence of Jones\u2019s showing any inclination to decide\nto vote for Bush) and the agent\u2019s decision (here, Jones\u2019s\ndeciding to vote for Clinton) is deterministic or not. If the\nconnection is deterministic, then Frankfurt-style cases cannot be\nexpected to convince incompatibilists that the ability to do otherwise\nis not necessary for moral responsibility and/or free will, since\nJones\u2019s action will be deterministically brought about by\nfactors beyond his control, leading incompatibilists to conclude that\nJones is not morally responsible for his decision. But if the\nconnection is nondeterministic, then it is possible even in the\nabsence of showing any inclination to decide to vote for Bush, that\nJones decides to vote for Bush, and so he retains the ability to do\notherwise. Either way Frankfurt-style cases fail to show that Jones is\nboth morally responsible for his decision and yet is unable to do\notherwise.\n\nWhile some have argued that even Frankfurt-style cases that assume\ndeterminism are effective (see, e.g., Fischer 1999, 2010, 2013 and\nHaji and McKenna 2004 and for criticisms of this approach, see Goetz\n2005, Palmer 2005, 2014, Widerker and Goetz 2013, and Cohen 2017), the\nmajority of proponents of Frankfurt-style cases have attempted to\nrevise these cases so that they are explicitly nondeterministic and\nyet still show that the agent was morally responsible even though he\nlacked the ability to do otherwise\u2014or, at least that he lacked\nany ability to do otherwise that could be relevant to\ngrounding the agent\u2019s moral responsibility (see, e.g.,\nMele and Robb 1998, 2003, Pereboom 2001, 2014, McKenna 2003, Hunt\n2005, and for criticisms of these cases see Ginet 2002, Timpe 2006,\nWiderker 2006, Franklin 2011c, Moya 2011, Palmer 2011, 2013, Robinson\n2014, Capes 2016, Capes and Swenson 2017, and Elzein 2017).\n\nSupposing that Frankfurt-style cases are successful, what exactly do\nthey show? In our view, they show neither that free will and moral\nresponsibility do not require an ability to do otherwise in any\nsense nor that compatibilism is true. Frankfurt-style cases are\nof clear help to the compatibilists\u2019 position (though see Speak\n2007 for a dissenting opinion). The Consequence Argument raises a\npowerful challenge to the cogency of compatibilism. But if\nFrankfurt-style cases are successful, agents can act freely in the\nsense relevant to moral responsibility while lacking the ability to do\notherwise in the all-in sense. This allows compatibilists to concede\nthat the all-in ability to do otherwise is incompatible with\ndeterminism, and yet insist that it is irrelevant to the question of\nthe compatibility of determinism with moral responsibility (and\nperhaps even free will, depending on how we define this) (cf. Fischer\n1987, 1994. For a challenge to the move from not strictly necessary to\nirrelevant, see O\u2019Connor [2000, 20\u201322] and in reply,\nFischer [2006, 152\u201356].). But, of course, showing that an\nargument for the falsity of compatibilism is irrelevant does not show\nthat compatibilism is true. Indeed, many incompatibilists maintain\nthat Frankfurt-style cases are successful and defend incompatibilism\nnot via the Consequence Argument, but by way of arguments that attempt\nto show that agents in deterministic worlds cannot be the\n\u2018source\u2019 of their actions in the way that moral\nresponsibility requires (Stump 1999; Zagzebski 2000; Pereboom 2001,\n2014). Thus, if successful, Frankfurt-style cases would be at best the\nfirst step in defending compatibilism. The second step must offer an\nanalysis of the kind of sourcehood constitutive of free will that\nentails that free will is compatible with determinism (cf. Fischer\n1982).\n\nFurthermore, while proponents of Frankfurt-style cases often maintain\nthat these cases show that no ability to do otherwise is necessary for\nmoral responsibility (\u201cI have employed the Frankfurt-type\nexample to argue that this sense of control [i.e. the one required for\nmoral responsibility] need not involve any alternative\npossibilities\u201d [Fischer 2006, p. 40; emphasis ours]), we believe\nthat this conclusion overreaches. At best, Frankfurt-style cases show\nthat the ability to do otherwise in the all-in sense\u2014in\nthe sense defined by the Categorical\nAnalysis\u2014is not necessary for free will or moral\nresponsibility (cf. Franklin 2015). To appreciate this, let us assume\nthat in the above Frankfurt-style case Jones lacks the ability to do\notherwise in the all-in sense: there is no possible world in which we\nhold fixed the past and laws and yet Jones does otherwise, since all\nsuch worlds include Black and his preparations for preventing Jones\nfrom doing otherwise should Jones show any inclination. Even if this\nis all true, it should take only a little reflection to recognize that\nin this case Jones is able to do otherwise in certain weaker senses we\nmight attach to that phrase, and compatibilists in fact still think\nthat the ability to do otherwise in some such senses is necessary for\nfree will and moral responsibility. Consequently, even though\nFrankfurt-style cases have, as a matter of fact, moved many\ncompatibilists away from emphasizing ability to do otherwise to\nemphasizing sourcehood, we suggest that this move is best seen as a\nweakening of the ability-to-do-otherwise condition on moral\nresponsibility (but see Cyr 2017 and Kittle 2019 for criticisms of\nthis claim). (A potentially important exception to this claim is\nSartorio [2016], who appealing to some controversial ideas in the\nmetaphysics of causation appears to argue that no sense of the ability\nto do otherwise is necessary for control in the sense at stake for\nmoral responsibility, but instead what matters is whether the agent is\nthe cause of the action. We simply note that Sartorio\u2019s account\nof causation is a modal one [see especially Sartorio (2016,\n94\u201395, 132\u201337)] and thus it is far from clear that her\naccount of freedom and responsibility is really an exception.)\n2.4 Compatibilist Accounts of Sourcehood\n\nIn this section, we will assume that Frankfurt-style cases are\nsuccessful in order to consider two prominent compatibilist attempts\nto construct analyses of the sourcehood condition (though see the\nentry on\n compatibilism\n for a more systematic survey of compatibilist theories of free will).\nThe first, and perhaps most popular, compatibilist model is a\nreasons-responsiveness model. According to this model, an\nagent\u2019s action \\(\\phi\\) is free just in case the agent or manner\nin which the action is brought about is responsive to the reasons\navailable to the agent at the time of action. While compatibilists\ndevelop this kind of account in different ways, the most detailed\nproposal is due to John Martin Fischer (1994, 2006, 2010, 2012;\nFischer and Ravizza 1998. For similar compatibilist treatments of\nreasons-responsiveness, see Wolf 1990, Wallace 1994, Haji 1998, Nelkin\n2011, McKenna 2013, Vargas 2013, Sartorio 2016). Fischer and Ravizza\nargue that an agent\u2019s action is free and one for which he is\nmorally responsible only if the mechanism that issued in the action is\nmoderately reasons-responsive (Fischer and Ravizza 1998, ch. 3). By\n\u2018mechanism\u2019, Fischer and Ravizza simply mean \u201cthe\nway the action was brought about\u201d (38). One mechanism they often\ndiscuss is practical deliberation. For example, in the case of Jones\ndiscussed above, his decision to vote for Clinton on his own was\nbrought about by the process of practical deliberation. What must be\ntrue of this process, this mechanism, for it to be moderately\nreasons-responsive? Fischer and Ravizza maintain that moderate\nreasons-responsiveness consists in two conditions: reasons-receptivity\nand reasons-reactivity. A mechanism\u2019s reasons-receptivity\ndepends on the agent\u2019s cognitive capacities, such as being\ncapable of understanding moral reasons and the implications of their\nactions (69\u201373). The second condition is more important for us\nin the present context. A mechanism\u2019s reasons-reactivity depends\non how the mechanism would react given different reasons for\naction. Fischer and Ravizza argue that the kind of reasons-reactivity\nat stake is weak reasons-reactivity, where this merely requires that\nthere is some possible world in which the laws of nature remain the\nsame, the same mechanism operates, there is a sufficient reason to do\notherwise, and the mechanism brings about the alternative action in\nresponse to this sufficient reason (73\u201376). On this analysis,\nwhile Jones, due to the activity of Black, lacks the \u2018all-in\u2019 sense of\nthe ability to do otherwise, he is nevertheless morally responsible\nfor deciding to vote for Clinton because his action finds its source\nin Jones\u2019s practical deliberation that is moderately\nreasons-responsive.\n\nFischer and Ravizza\u2019s theory of freedom and responsibility has shifted\nthe focus of much recent debate to questions of sourcehood. Moreover,\none might argue that this theory is a clear improvement over classical\ncompatibilism with respect to handling cases of phobia. By focusing on\nmechanisms, Fischer and Ravizza can argue that our agoraphobic Luke is\nnot morally responsible for deciding to refrain from going outside\nbecause the mechanism that issues in this action\u2014namely his\nagoraphobia\u2014is not moderately reasons-responsive. There is no\nworld with the same laws of nature as our own, this mechanism\noperates, and yet it reacts to a sufficient reason to go outside. No\nmatter what reasons there are for Luke to go outside, when acting on\nthis mechanism, he will always refrain from going outside (cf. Fischer\n1987, 74).\n\nBefore turning to our second compatibilist model, it is worth noting\nthat it would be a mistake to think that Fischer and Ravizza\u2019s\naccount is a sourcehood account to the exclusion of the ability to do\notherwise in any sense. As we have just seen, Fischer and\nRavizza place clear modal requirements on mechanisms that\nissue in actions with respect to which agents are free and morally\nresponsible. Indeed, this should be clear from the very idea of\nreasons-responsiveness. Whether one is responsive depends not merely\non how one does respond, but also on how one would respond.\nThus, any account that makes reasons-responsiveness an essential\ncondition of free will is an account that makes the ability to do\notherwise, in some sense, necessary for free will (Fischer [2018]\nconcedes this point, though, as noted above, the reader should\nconsider Sartorio [2016] as a potential counterexample to this\nclaim).\n\nThe second main compatibilist model of sourcehood is an identification\nmodel. Accounts of sourcehood of this kind lay stress on\nself-determination or autonomy: to be the source of her action the\nagent must self-determine her action. Like the contemporary discussion\nof the ability to do otherwise, the contemporary discussion of the\npower of self-determination begins with the failure of classical\ncompatibilism to produce an acceptable definition. According to\nclassical compatibilists, self-determination simply consists in the\nagent\u2019s action being determined by her strongest motive. On the\nassumption that some compulsive agents\u2019 compulsions operate by\ngenerating irresistible desires to act in certain ways, the classical\ncompatibilist analysis of self-determination implies that these\ncompulsive actions are self-determined. While Hobbes seems willing to\naccept this implication (1656 [1999], 78), most contemporary\ncompatibilists concede that this result is unacceptable.\n\nBeginning with the work of Harry Frankfurt (1971) and Gary Watson\n(1975), many compatibilists have developed identification accounts of\nself-determination that attempt to draw a distinction between an\nagent\u2019s desires or motives that are internal to the agent and\nthose that are external. The idea is that while agents are not (or at\nleast may not be) identical to any motivations (or bundle of\nmotivations), they are identified with a subset of their\nmotivations, rendering these motivations internal to the agent in such\na way that any actions brought about by these motivations are\nself-determined. The identification relation is not an\nidentity relation, but something weaker (cf. Bratman 2000, 39n12).\nWhat the precise nature of the identification relation is and to which\nattitudes an agent stands in this relation is hotly disputed.\nLippert-Rasmussen (2003) helpfully divides identification accounts\ninto two main types. The first are \u201cauthority\u201d accounts,\naccording to which agents are identified with attitudes that are\nauthorized to speak for them (368). The second are\nauthenticity accounts, according to which agents are identified with\nattitudes that reveal who they truly are (368). (But see\nShoemaker 2015 for an ecumenical account of identification that blends\nthese two accounts.) Proposed attitudes to which agents are said to\nstand in the identification relation include higher-order desires\n(Frankfurt 1971), cares or loves (Frankfurt 1993, 1994; Shoemaker\n2003; Jaworska 2007; Sripada 2016), self-governing policies (Bratman\n2000), the desire to make sense of oneself (Velleman 1992, 2009), and\nperceptions (or judgments) of the good (or best) (Watson 1975; Stump\n1988; Ekstrom 1993; Mitchell-Yellin 2015).\n\nThe distinction between internal and external motivations allows\nidentification theorists to enrich classical compatibilists\u2019\nunderstanding of constraint, while remaining compatibilists about free\nwill and determinism. According to classical compatibilists, the only\nkind of constraint is external (e.g., broken cars and broken legs),\nbut addictions and phobias seem just as threatening to free will.\nIdentification theorists have the resources to concede that some\nconstraints are internal. For example, they can argue that our\nagoraphobic Luke is not free in refraining from going outside even\nthough this decision was caused by his strongest desires because he is\nnot identified with his strongest desires. On compatibilist\nidentification accounts, what matters for self-determination is not\nwhether our actions are determined or undetermined, but whether they\nare brought about by motives with which the agent is identified:\nexercises of the power of self-determination consists in an\nagent\u2019s actions being brought about, in part, by an\nagent\u2019s motives with which she is identified. (It is important\nto note that while we have distinguished reasons-responsive accounts\nfrom identification accounts, there is nothing preventing one from\ncombing both elements in a complete analysis of free will.)\n\nEven if these reasons-responsive and identification compatibilist\naccounts of sourcehood might successfully side-step the Consequence\nArgument, they must come to grips with a second incompatibilist\nargument: the Manipulation Argument. The general problem raised by\nthis line of argument is that whatever proposed compatibilist\nconditions for an agent \\(S\\)\u2019s being free with respect to, and\nmorally responsible for, some action \\(\\phi\\), it will seem that\nagents can be manipulated into satisfying these conditions with\nrespect to \\(\\phi\\) and, yet, precisely because they are manipulated\ninto satisfying these conditions, their freedom and responsibility\nseem undermined. The two most influential forms of the Manipulation\nArgument are Pereboom\u2019s Four-case Argument (2001, ch. 4; 2014,\nch. 4) and Mele\u2019s Zygote Argument (2006, ch. 7. See Todd 2010,\n2012 for developments of Mele\u2019s argument). As the structure of\nMele\u2019s version is simpler, we will focus on it.\n\nImagine a goddess Diana who creates a zygote \\(Z\\) in Mary in some\ndeterministic world. Suppose that Diana creates \\(Z\\) as she does\nbecause she wants Jones to be murdered thirty years later. From her\nknowledge of the laws of nature in her world and her knowledge of the\nstate of the world just prior to her creating \\(Z\\), she knows that a\nzygote with precisely \\(Z\\)\u2019s constitution located in Mary will\ndevelop into an agent Ernie who, thirty years later, will murder Jones\nas a result of his moderately reasons-responsive mechanism and on the\nbasis of motivations with which he is identified (whatever those might\nbe). Suppose Diana succeeds in her plan and Ernie murders Jones as a\nresult of her manipulation.\n\nMany judge that Ernie is not morally responsible for murdering Jones\neven though he satisfies both the reasons-responsive and\nidentification criteria. There are two possible lines of reply open to\ncompatibilists. On the soft-line reply, compatibilists attempt to show\nthat there is a relevant difference between manipulated agents such as\nErnie and agents who satisfy their account (McKenna 2008, 470). For\nexample, Fischer and Ravizza propose a second condition on sourcehood:\nin addition to a mechanism\u2019s being moderately\nreasons-responsive, an agent is morally responsible for the output of\nsuch a mechanism only if the agent has come to take responsibility for\nthe mechanism, where an agent has taken responsibility for a mechanism\n\\(M\\) just in case (i) she believes that she is an agent when acting\nfrom \\(M\\), (ii) she believes that she is an apt target for blame and\npraise for acting from \\(M\\), and (iii) her beliefs specified in (i)\nand (ii) are \u201cbased, in an appropriate way, on [her]\nevidence\u201d (Fischer and Ravizza 1998, 238). The problem with this\nreply is that we can easily imagine Diana creating Ernie so that his\nmurdering Jones is a result not only of a moderately\nreasons-responsive mechanism, but also a mechanism for which he has\ntaken responsibility. On the hard-line reply, compatibilists concede\nthat, despite initial appearances, the manipulated agent is free and\nmorally responsible and attempt to ameliorate the seeming\ncounterintuitiveness of this concession (McKenna 2008, 470\u201371).\nHere compatibilists might point out that the idea of being manipulated\nis worrisome only so long as the manipulators are interfering with an\nagent\u2019s development. But if the manipulators simply create a\nperson, and then allow that person\u2019s life to unfold without any\nfurther inference, the manipulators\u2019 activity is no threat to\nfreedom (McKenna 2008; Fischer 2011; Sartorio 2016, ch. 5). (For other\nresponses to the Manipulation Argument, see Kearns 2012; Sripada 2012;\nMcKenna 2014.)\n2.5 Libertarian Accounts of Sourcehood\n\nDespite these compatibilist replies, to some the idea that the\nentirety of a free agent\u2019s life can be determined, and\nin this way controlled, by another agent will seem incredible. Some\ntake the lesson of the Manipulation Argument to be that no\ncompatibilist account of sourcehood or self-determination is\nsatisfactory. True sourcehood\u2014the kind of sourcehood that can\nactually ground an agent\u2019s freedom and\nresponsibility\u2014requires, so it is argued, that one\u2019s\naction not be causally determined by factors beyond one\u2019s\ncontrol.\n\nLibertarians, while united in endorsing this negative condition on\nsourcehood, are deeply divided concerning which further positive\nconditions may be required. It is important to note that while\nlibertarians are united in insisting that compatibilist accounts of\nsourcehood are insufficient, they are not committed to thinking that\nthe conditions of freedom spelled out in terms either of\nreasons-responsiveness or of identification are not necessary. For\nexample, Stump (1988, 1996, 2010) builds a sophisticated libertarian\nmodel of free will out of resources originally developed within\nFrankfurt\u2019s identification model (see also Ekstrom 1993, 2000;\nFranklin 2014) and nearly all libertarians agree that exercises of\nfree will require agents to be reasons-responsive (e.g., Kane 1996; Clarke 2003, chs. 8\u20139; Franklin 2018, ch.\n2). Moreover, while this section focuses on libertarian accounts of\nsourcehood, we remind readers that most (if not all) libertarians\nthink that the freedom to do otherwise is also necessary for free will\nand moral responsibility.\n\nThere are three main libertarian options for understanding sourcehood\nor self-determination: non-causal libertarianism (Ginet 1990, 2008;\nMcCann 1998; Lowe 2008; Goetz 2009; Pink 2017; Palmer 2021),\nevent-causal libertarianism (Wiggins 1973; Kane 1996, 1999, 2011,\n2016; Mele 1995, chs. 11\u201312; 2006, chs. 4\u20135; 2017; Ekstrom\n2000, 2019; Clarke 2003, chs. 2\u20136; Franklin 2018), and\nagent-causal libertarianism (Reid 1788 [1969]; Chisholm 1966, 1976;\nTaylor 1966; O\u2019Connor 2000; Clarke 1993; 1996;\n2003, chs. 8\u201310; Griffith 2010; Steward 2012). Non-causal\nlibertarians contend that exercises of the power of self-determination\nneed not (or perhaps even cannot) be caused or causally structured.\nAccording to this view, we control our volition or choice simply in\nvirtue of its being ours\u2014its occurring in us. We do not exert a\nspecial kind of causality in bringing it about; instead, it is an\nintrinsically active event, intrinsically something we do.\nWhile there may be causal influences upon our choice, there need not\nbe, and any such causal influence is wholly irrelevant to\nunderstanding why it occurs. Reasons provide an autonomous, non-causal\nform of explanation. Provided our choice is not wholly determined by\nprior factors, it is free and under our control simply in virtue of\nbeing ours. Non-causal views have failed to garner wide support among\nlibertarians since, for many, self-determination seems to be\nan essentially causal notion (cf. Mele 2000 and Clarke 2003, ch. 2). This dispute hinges on the necessary\nconditions on the concept of causal power, and relatedly on whether\npower simpliciter admits causal and non-causal variants. For\ndiscussion, see O\u2019Connor (2021).\n\nMost libertarians endorse an event-causal or agent-causal account of\nsourcehood. Both these accounts maintain that exercises of the power\nof self-determination consist partly in the agent\u2019s bringing\nabout her choice or action, but they disagree on how to analyze an\nagent\u2019s bringing about her choice. While event-causal\nlibertarianism admits of different species, at the heart of this view\nis the idea that self-determining an action requires, at minimum, that\nthe agent cause the action and that an agent\u2019s causing his\naction is wholly reducible to mental states and other events\ninvolving the agent nondeviantly causing his action. Consider an\nagent\u2019s raising his hand. According to the event-causal model at\nits most basic level, an agent\u2019s raising his hand consists in\nthe agent\u2019s causing his hand to rise and his causing his hand to\nrise consists in apt mental states and events involving the\nagent\u2014such as the agent\u2019s desire to ask a question and his\nbelief that he can ask a question by raising his\nhand\u2014nondeviantly causing his hand to rise. (The\nnondeviance clause is required since it seems possible that an event\nbe brought about by one\u2019s desires and beliefs and yet not be\nself-determined, or even an action for that matter, due to the unusual\ncausal path leading from the desires and beliefs to action. Imagine a\nwould-be accomplice of an assassin believes that his dropping his\ncigarette is the signal for the assassin to shoot his intended victim\nand he desires to drop his cigarette and yet this belief and desire so\nunnerve him that he accidentally drops his cigarette. While the event\nof dropping the cigarette is caused by a relevant desire and belief it\ndoes not seem to be self-determined and perhaps is not even an action\n[cf. Davidson 1973].) To fully spell out this account, event-causal\nlibertarians must specify which mental states and events are apt (cf.\nBrand 1979)\u2014which mental states and events are the springs of\nself-determined actions\u2014and what nondeviance consists in (cf.\nBishop 1989). (We note that this has proven very difficult, enough so\nthat some take the problem to spell doom for event-causal theories of\naction. Such philosophers [e.g., Taylor 1966 and Sehon 2005] take\nagential power to be conceptually and/or ontologically primitive and\nunderstand reasons explanations of action in irreducibly teleological\nterms. See Stout 2010 for a brisk survey of discussions of this\ntopic.) For ease, in what follows we will assume that apt mental\nstates are an agent\u2019s reasons that favor the action.\n\nEvent-causal libertarians, of course, contend that self-determination\nrequires more than nondeviant causation by agents\u2019 reasons: for\nit is possible that agents\u2019 actions in deterministic worlds are\nnondeviantly caused by apt mental states and events.\nSelf-determination requires nondeterministic causation, in a\nnondeviant way, by an agent\u2019s reasons. While historically many\nhave thought that nondeterministic causation is impossible (Hobbes\n1654 [1999], 1656 [1999]; Hume 1740 [1978], 1748 [1975]), with the\nadvent of quantum physics and, from a very different direction, an\ninfluential essay by G.E.M. Anscombe (1971), it is now widely\nassumed that nondeterministic (or probabilistic) causation is\npossible. There are two importantly different ways to understand\nnondeterministic causation: as the causation of probability or as the\nprobability of causation. Under\nthe causation of probability model, a nondeterministic cause \\(C\\)\ncauses (or causally contributes to) the objective probability of the\noutcome\u2019s occurring rather than the outcome itself. On this\naccount, \\(S\\)\u2019s reasons do not cause his decision but there\nbeing a certain antecedent objective probability of its occurring, and\nthe decision itself is uncaused. On the competing probability of\ncausation model, a nondeterministic cause \\(C\\) causes the outcome of\na nondeterministic process. Given that \\(C\\) is a nondeterministic\ncause of the outcome, it was possible given the exact same past and\nlaws of nature that \\(C\\) not cause the outcome (perhaps because it\nwas possible that some other event cause some other outcome)\u2014the\nprobability of this causal transaction\u2019s occurring was less than\n\\(1\\). Given that event-causal libertarians maintain that\nself-determined actions, and thus free actions, must be caused, they\nare committed to the probability of causation model of\nnondeterministic causation (cf. Franklin 2018, 25\u201326). (We note\nthat Balaguer [2010] is skeptical of the above distinction, and it is\nthus unclear whether he should best be classified as a non-causal or\nevent-causal libertarian, though see Balaguer [2014] for evidence that\nit is best to treat him as a non-causalist.) Consequently, according\nto event-causal libertarians, when an agent \\(S\\) self-determines his\nchoice \\(\\phi\\), then \\(S\\)\u2019s reasons \\(r_1\\)\nnondeterministically cause (in a nondeviant way) \\(\\phi\\), and it was\npossible, given the past and laws, that \\(r_1\\) not have caused\n\\(\\phi\\), but rather some of \\(S\\)\u2019s other reasons \\(r_2\\)\nnondeterministically caused (in a nondeviant way) a different action\n\\(\\psi\\).\n\nAgent-causal libertarians contend that the event-causal picture fails\nto capture self-determination, for it fails to accord the agent with a\npower to settle what she does. Pereboom offers a forceful\nstatement of this worry:\n\n\nOn an event-causal libertarian picture, the relevant causal conditions\nantecedent to the decision, i.e., the occurrence of certain\nagent-involving events, do not settle whether the decision will occur,\nbut only render the occurrence of the decision about \\(50\\%\\)\nprobable. In fact, because no occurrence of antecedent events settles\nwhether the decision will occur, and only antecedent events are\ncausally relevant, nothing settles whether the decision will\noccur. (Pereboom 2014, 32; cf. Watson 1987, 1996; Clarke 2003 [ch. 8], 2011; Griffith 2010; Shabo 2011, 2013;\nSteward 2012 [ch. 3]; and Schlosser 2014); and for critical\nassessment, see Clarke 2019.\n\n\nOn the event-causal picture, the agent\u2019s causal contribution to\nher actions is exhausted by the causal contribution of her reasons,\nand yet her reasons leave open which decisions she will make, and this\nseems insufficient for self-determination.\n\nBut what more must be added? Agent-causal libertarians maintain that\nself-determination requires that the agent herself play a\ncausal role over and above the causal role played by her reasons. Some\nagent-causal libertarians deny that an agent\u2019s reasons play any\ndirect causal role in bringing about an agent\u2019s self-determined\nactions (Chisholm 1966; O\u2019Connor 2000, ch. 5), whereas\nothers allow or even require that self-determined actions be caused in\npart by the agent\u2019s reasons (Clarke 2003, ch. 9; Steward 2012,\nch. 3). But all agent-causal libertarians insist that exercises of the\npower of self-determination do not reduce to nondeterministic\ncausation by apt mental states: agent-causation does not reduce to\nevent-causation.\n\nAgent-causal libertarianism seems to capture an aspect of\nself-determination that neither the above compatibilists accounts nor\nevent-causal libertarian accounts capture. (Some compatibilists even\naccept this and try to incorporate agent-causation into a\ncompatibilist understanding of free will. See Markosian 1999, 2012;\nNelkin 2011.) These accounts reduce the causal role of the self to\nstates and events to which the agent is not identical (even if he is\nidentified with them). But how can self-determination of my\nactions wholly reduce to determination of my actions by things\nother than the self? Richard Taylor nicely expresses this\nintuition: \u201cIf I believe that something not identical to myself\nwas the cause of my behavior\u2014some event wholly external to\nmyself, for instance, or even one internal to myself, such as a nerve\nimpulse, volition, or whatnot\u2014then I cannot regard the behavior\nas being an act of mine, unless I further believed that I was the\ncause of that external or internal event\u201d (1974, 55; cf.\nFranklin 2016).\n\nDespite its powerful intuitive pull for some, many have argued that\nagent-causal libertarianism is obscure or even incoherent. The stock\nobjection used to be that the very idea of\nagent-causation\u2014causation by agents that is not reducible to\ncausation by mental states and events involving the agent\u2014is\nincoherent, but this objection has become less common due to\npioneering work by Chisholm (1966, 1976), Taylor (1974),\nO\u2019Connor (2000, 2011), Clarke (2003), and Steward 2012, ch. 8). More common objections now concern, first, how to understand the\nrelationship between agent-causation and an agent\u2019s reasons (or\nmotivations in general), and, second, the empirical adequacy of\nagent-causal libertarianism. With respect to the first worry, it is\nwidely assumed that the only (or at least best) way to understand\nreasons-explanation and motivational influence is within a causal\naccount of reasons, where reasons cause our actions (Davidson 1963;\nMele 1992). If agent-causal libertarians accept that self-determined\nactions, in addition to being agent-caused, must also be caused by\nagents\u2019 reasons that favored those actions, then agent-causal\nlibertarians need to explain how to integrate these causes (for a\ndetailed attempt to do just this, see Clarke 2003, ch. 8). Given that\nthese two causes seem distinct, is it not possible that the agent\ncause his decision to \\(\\phi\\) and yet the agent\u2019s reasons\nsimultaneously cause an incompatible decision to \\(\\psi\\)? If\nagent-causal libertarians side-step this difficult question by denying\nthat reasons cause action, then they must explain how reasons can\nexplain and motivate action without causing it; and this has turned\nout to be no easy task. (For more general attempts to\nunderstand reasons-explanation and motivation within a non-causal\nframework see Schueler 1995, 2003; Sehon 2005). For further discussion\nsee the entry on\n incompatibilist (nondeterministic) theories of free will.\n\nFinally, we note that some recent philosophers have questioned the\npresumed difference between event- and agent-causation by arguing that\nall causation is object or substance causation. They argue\nthat the dominant tendency to understand \u2018garden variety\u2019\ncausal transactions in the world as relations between events is an\nunfortunate legacy of David Hume\u2019s rejection of substance and\ncausation as basic metaphysical categories. On the competing\nmetaphysical picture of the world, the event or state of an\nobject\u2019s having some property such as mass is its having a\ncausal power, which in suitable circumstances it exercises to bring\nabout a characteristic effect. Applied to human agents in an account\nof free will, the account suggests a picture on which an agent\u2019s\nhaving desires, beliefs, and intentions are rational powers to will\nparticular courses of action, and where the agent\u2019s willing is\nnot determined in any one direction, she wills freely. An advantage\nfor the agent-causalist who embraces this broader metaphysics is\n\u2018ideological\u2019 parsimony. For different developments and\ndefenses of this approach, see Lowe (2008), Swinburne (2013), and O\u2019Connor (2021); and for reason\nto doubt that a substance-causal metaphysics helps to allay skepticism\nconcerning free will, see Clarke and Reed (2015).\n3. Do We Have Free Will?\n\nMost philosophers theorizing about free will take themselves to be\nattempting to analyze a near-universal power of mature human beings.\nBut as we\u2019ve noted above, there have been free will skeptics in\nboth ancient and (especially) modern times. (Israel 2001 highlights a\nnumber of such skeptics in the early modern period.) In this section,\nwe summarize the main lines of argument both for and against the\nreality of human freedom of will.\n3.1 Arguments Against the Reality of Free Will\n\nThere are both a priori and empirical arguments against free will (See\nthe entry on\n skepticism about moral responsibility).\n Several of these start with an argument that free will is\nincompatible with causal determinism, which we will not rehearse here.\nInstead, we focus on arguments that human beings lack free will,\nagainst the background assumption that freedom and causal determinism\nare incompatible.\n\nThe most radical a priori argument is that free will is not merely\ncontingently absent but is impossible. Nietzsche 1886 [1966] argues to\nthis effect, and more recently it has been argued by Galen Strawson\n(1986, ch. 2; 1994, 2002). Strawson associates free will with being\n\u2018ultimately morally responsible\u2019 for one\u2019s actions.\nHe argues that, because how one acts is a result of, or explained by,\n\u201chow one is, mentally speaking\u201d (\\(M\\)), for one to be\nresponsible for that choice one must be responsible for \\(M\\). To be\nresponsible for \\(M\\), one must have chosen to be \\(M\\)\nitself\u2014and that not blindly, but deliberately, in accordance\nwith some reasons \\(r_1\\). But for that choice to be a responsible\none, one must have chosen to be such as to be moved by \\(r_1\\),\nrequiring some further reasons \\(r_2\\) for such a choice. And so on,\nad infinitum. Free choice requires an impossible infinite\nregress of choices to be the way one is in making choices.\n\nThere have been numerous replies to Strawson\u2019s argument. Mele\n(1995, 221ff.) argues that Strawson misconstrues the locus of freedom\nand responsibility. Freedom is principally a feature of our actions,\nand only derivatively of our characters from which such actions\nspring. The task of the theorist is to show how one is in rational,\nreflective control of the choices one makes, consistent with there\nbeing no freedom-negating conditions. While this seems right, when\nconsidering those theories that make one\u2019s free control to\nreside directly in the causal efficacy of one\u2019s reasons (such as\ncompatibilist reasons-responsive accounts or event-causal\nlibertarianism), it is not beside the point to reflect on how one came\nto be that way in the first place and to worry that such reflection\nshould lead one to conclude that true responsibility (and hence\nfreedom) is undermined, since a complete distal source of any action\nmay be found external to the agent. Clarke (2003, 170\u201376) argues\nthat an effective reply may be made by indeterminists, and, in\nparticular, by nondeterministic agent-causal theorists. Such theorists\ncontend that (i) aspects of \u2018how one is, mentally\nspeaking\u2019, fully explain an agent\u2019s choice\nwithout causally determining it and (ii) the agent himself causes the\nchoice that is made (so that the agent\u2019s antecedent state, while\ngrounding an explanation of the action, is not the complete causal\nsource of it). Since the agent\u2019s exercise of this power is\ncausally undetermined, it is not true that there is a sufficient\n\u2018ultimate\u2019 source of it external to the agent. Finally,\nMele (2006, 129\u201334, and 2017, 212\u201316) and O\u2019Connor\n(2009b) suggest that freedom and moral responsibility come in\ndegrees and grow over time, reflecting the fact that \u2018how one\nis, mentally speaking\u2019 is increasingly shaped by one\u2019s own\npast choices. Furthermore, some choices for a given individual may\nreflect more freedom and responsibility than others, which may be the\nkernel of truth behind Strawson\u2019s sweeping argument. (For\ndiscussion of the ways that nature, nurture, and contingent\ncircumstances shape our behavior and raise deep issues concerning the\nextent of our freedom and responsibility, see Levy 2011 and\nRussell 2017, chs. 10\u201312.)\n\nA second family of arguments against free will contend that, in one\nway or another, nondeterministic theories of freedom entail either\nthat agents lack control over their choices or that the choices cannot\nbe adequately explained. These arguments are variously called the\n\u2018Mind\u2019, \u2018Rollback\u2019, or \u2018Luck\u2019\nargument, with the latter admitting of several versions. (For\nstatements of such arguments, see van Inwagen 1983, ch. 4; 2000; Haji\n2001; Mele 2006; Shabo 2011, 2013, 2020; Coffman 2015). We note that\nsome philosophers advance such arguments not as parts of a general\ncase against free will, but merely as showing the inadequacy of\nspecific accounts of free will [see, e.g., Griffith 2010].) They each\ndescribe imagined cases\u2014individual cases, or comparison of\nintra- or inter-world duplicate antecedent conditions followed by\ndiverging outcomes\u2014designed to elicit the judgment that the\noccurrence of a choice that had remained unsettled given all\nprior causal factors can only be a \u2018matter of chance\u2019,\n\u2018random\u2019, or \u2018a matter of luck\u2019. Such terms\nhave been imported from other contexts and have come to function as\nquasi-technical, unanalyzed concepts in these debates, and it is\nperhaps more helpful to avoid such proxies and to conduct the debates\ndirectly in terms of the metaphysical notion of control and epistemic\nnotion of explanation. Where the arguments question whether an\nundetermined agent can exercise appropriate control over the choice he\nmakes, proponents of nondeterministic theories often reply that\ncontrol is not exercised prior to, but at the time of the\nchoice\u2014in the very act of bringing it about (see, e.g., Clarke\n2005 and O\u2019Connor 2007). Where the arguments question whether\nundetermined choices can be adequately explained, the reply often\nconsists in identifying a form of explanation other than the form\ndemanded by the critic\u2014a \u2018noncontrastive\u2019\nexplanation, perhaps, rather than a \u2018contrastive\u2019\nexplanation, or a species of contrastive explanation consistent with\nindeterminism (see, e.g., Kane 1999;\nClarke, 2003, ch. 8; and Franklin 2011a; 2018, ch. 5).\n\nWe now consider empirical arguments against human freedom. Some of\nthese stem from the physical sciences (while making assumptions\nconcerning the way physical phenomena fix psychological phenomena) and\nothers from neuroscience and psychology.\n\nIt used to be common for philosophers to argue that there is empirical\nreason to believe that the world in general is causally determined,\nand since human beings are parts of the world, they are too. Many took\nthis to be strongly confirmed by the spectacular success of Isaac\nNewton\u2019s framework for understanding the universe as governed\neverywhere by fairly simple, exceptionless laws of motion. But the\nquantum revolution of the early twentieth century has made that\n\u2018clockwork universe\u2019 image at least doubtful at the level\nof basic physics. While quantum mechanics has proven spectacularly\nsuccessful as a framework for making precise and accurate predictions\nof certain observable phenomena, its implications for the causal\nstructure of reality is still not well understood, and there are\ncompeting indeterministic and deterministic interpretations. See the\nentry on\n quantum mechanics\n for detailed discussion.) It is possible that indeterminacy on the\nsmall-scale, supposing it to be genuine, \u2018cancels out\u2019 at\nthe macroscopic scale of birds and buildings and people, so that\nbehavior at this scale is virtually deterministic. But this idea, once\ncommon, is now being challenged empirically, even at the level of\nbasic biology. Furthermore, the social, biological, and medical\nsciences, too, are rife with merely statistical generalizations.\nPlainly, the jury is out on all these inter-theoretic questions. But\nthat is just a way to say that current science does not\ndecisively support the idea that everything we do is pre-determined by\nthe past, and ultimately by the distant past, wholly out of our\ncontrol. For discussion, see Balaguer (2009), Koch (2009), Roskies\n(2014), Ellis (2016).\n\nMaybe, then, we are subject to myriad causal influences, but the sum\ntotal of these influences doesn\u2019t determine what we do, they\nonly make it more or less likely that we\u2019ll do this or that. Now\nsome of the a priori no-free-will arguments above center on\nnondeterministic theories according to which there are objective\nantecedent probabilities associated with each possible choice outcome.\nWhy objective probabilities of this kind might present special\nproblems beyond those posed by the absence of determinism has been\ninsufficiently explored to date. (For brief discussion, see Vicens\n2016 and O\u2019Connor 2016.) But one philosopher who argues that\nthere is reason to hold that our actions, if undetermined, are\ngoverned by objective probabilities and that this fact calls into\nquestion whether we act freely is Derk Pereboom (2001, ch. 3; 2014,\nch. 3). Pereboom notes that our best physical theories indicate that\nstatistical laws govern isolated, small-scale physical events, and he\ninfers from the thesis that human beings are wholly physically\ncomposed that such statistical laws will also govern all the physical\ncomponents of human actions. Finally, Pereboom maintains that\nagent-causal libertarianism offers the correct analysis of free will.\nHe then invites us to imagine that the antecedent probability of some\nphysical component of an action occurring is \\(0.32\\). If the action\nis free while not violating the statistical law, then, in a scenario\nwith a large enough number of instances, this action would have to be\nfreely chosen close to \\(32\\) percent of the time. This leads to the\nproblem of \u201cwild coincidences\u201d:\n\n\nif the occurrence of these physical components were settled by the\nchoices of agent-causes, then their actually being chosen close to 32\npercent of the time would amount to a coincidence no less wild than\nthe coincidence of possible actions whose physical components have an\nantecedent probability of about 0.99 being chosen, over large enough\nnumber of instances, close to 99 percent of the time. The proposal\nthat agent-caused free choices do not diverge from what the\nstatistical laws predict for the physical components of our actions\nwould run so sharply counter to what we would expect as to make it\nincredible. (2014, 67)\n\n\nClarke (2010) questions the implicit assumption that free agent-causal\nchoices should be expected not to conform to physical\nstatistical laws, while O\u2019Connor (2009a) challenges the more\ngeneral assumption that freedom requires that agent-causal choices not\nbe governed by statistical laws of any kind, as they plausibly would\nbe if the relevant psychological states/powers are strongly emergent\nfrom physical states of the human brain. Finally, Runyan 2018 argues\nthat Pereboom\u2019s case rests on an implausible empirical assumption\nconcerning the evolution of objective probabilities concerning types\nof behavior over time. \n\nPereboom\u2019s empirical basis for free will skepticism is very\ngeneral. Others see support for free will skepticism from specific\nfindings and theories in the human sciences. They point to evidence\nthat we can be unconsciously influenced in the choices we make by a\nrange of factors, including ones that are not motivationally relevant;\nthat we can come to believe that we chose to initiate a behavior that\nin fact was artificially induced; that people subject to certain\nneurological disorders will sometimes engage in purposive behavior\nwhile sincerely believing that they are not directing them. Finally, a\ngreat deal of attention has been given to the work of neuroscientist\nBenjamin Libet (2002). Libet conducted some simple experiments that\nseemed to reveal the existence of \u2018preparatory\u2019 brain\nactivity (the \u2018readiness potential\u2019) shortly before a subject engages\nin an ostensibly spontaneous action. (Libet interpreted this activity\nas the brain\u2019s \u2018deciding\u2019 what to do before we are\nconsciously settled on a course of action.) Wegner (2002) surveys all\nof these findings (some of which are due to his own work as a social\npsychologist) and argues on their basis that the experience of\nconscious willing is \u2018an illusion\u2019. For criticism of such\narguments, see Mele (2009); Nahmias (2014);\nMudrik et al. (2022); and several contributions to Maoz and\nSinnott-Armstrong (2022). Libet\u2019s interpretation of the readiness\npotential has come in for severe criticism. After extensive subsequent\nstudy, neuroscientists are uncertain what it signifies. For thorough\nreview of the evidence, see Schurger et al. (2021).\n\nWhile Pereboom and others point to these empirical considerations in\ndefense of free will skepticism, other philosophers see them as\nreasons to favor a more modest free will agnosticism (Kearns 2015) or\nto promote revisionism about the \u2018folk idea of free will\u2019\n(Vargas 2013; Nichols 2015).\n3.2 Arguments for the Reality of Free Will\n\nIf one is a compatibilist, then a case for the reality of free will\nrequires evidence for our being effective agents who for the most part\nare aware of what we do and why we are doing it. If one is an\nincompatibilist, then the case requires in addition evidence\nfor causal indeterminism, occurring in the right locations in the\nprocess leading from deliberation to action. Many think that we\nalready have third-personal \u2018neutral\u2019 scientific evidence\nfor much of human behavior\u2019s satisfying modest compatibilist\nrequirements, such as Fischer and Ravizza\u2019s\nreasons-responsiveness account. However, given the immaturity of\nsocial science and the controversy over whether psychological states\n\u2018reduce\u2019 in some sense to underlying physical states (and\nwhat this might entail for the reality of mental causation), this\nclaim is doubtful. A more promising case for our satisfying (at least)\ncompatibilist requirements on freedom is that effective agency is\npresupposed by all scientific inquiry and so cannot\nrationally be doubted (which fact is overlooked by some of the more\nextreme \u2018willusionists\u2019 such as Wegner).\n\nHowever, effective intervention in the world (in scientific practice\nand elsewhere) does not (obviously) require that our behavior be\ncausally undetermined, so the \u2018freedom is rationally\npresupposed\u2019 argument cannot be launched for such an\nunderstanding of freedom. Instead, incompatibilists usually give one\nof the following two bases for rational belief in freedom (both of\nwhich can be given by compatibilists, too).\n\nFirst, philosophers have long claimed that we have introspective\nevidence of freedom in our experience of action, or perhaps of\nconsciously attended or deliberated action. Augustine and Scotus,\ndiscussed earlier, are two examples among many. In recent years,\nphilosophers have been more carefully scrutinizing the experience of\nagency and a debate has emerged concerning its contents, and in\nparticular whether it supports an indeterministic theory of human free\naction. For discussion, see Deery et al. (2013), Guillon (2014),\nHorgan (2015), and Bayne (2017).\n\nSecond, philosophers (e.g., Reid 1788 [1969], Swinburne 2013)\nsometimes claim that our belief in the reality of free will is\nepistemically basic, or reasonable without requiring independent\nevidential support. Most philosophers hold that some beliefs have that\nstatus, on pain of our having no justified beliefs whatever. It is\ncontroversial, however, just which beliefs do because it is\ncontroversial which criteria a belief must satisfy to qualify for that\nprivileged status. It is perhaps necessary that a basic belief be\n\u2018instinctive\u2019 (unreflectively held) for all or most human\nbeings; that it be embedded in regular experience; and that it be\ncentral to our understanding of an important aspect of the world. Our\nbelief in free will seems to meet these criteria, but whether they are\nsufficient is debated. (O\u2019Connor 2019 proposes that free will\nbelief is epistemically basic but defeasible.) Other philosophers\ndefend a variation on this stance, maintaining instead that belief in\nthe reality of moral responsibility is epistemically basic, and that\nsince moral responsibility entails free will, or so it is claimed, we\nmay infer the reality of free will (see, e.g., van Inwagen\n1983, 206\u201313).\n4. Theological Wrinkles\n4.1 Free Will and God\u2019s Power, Knowledge, and Goodness\n\nA large portion of Western philosophical work on free will has been\nwritten within an overarching theological framework, according to\nwhich God is the ultimate source, sustainer, and end of all else. Some\nof these thinkers draw the conclusion that God must be a sufficient,\nwholly determining cause for everything that happens; all of them\nsuppose that every creaturely act necessarily depends on the\nexplanatorily prior, cooperative activity of God. It is also commonly\npresumed by philosophical theists that human beings are free and\nresponsible (on pain of attributing evil in the world to God alone,\nand so impugning His perfect goodness). Hence, those who believe that\nGod is omni-determining typically are compatibilists with respect to\nfreedom and (in this case) theological determinism. Edwards (1754\n[1957]) is a good example. But those who suppose that God\u2019s\nsustaining activity (and special activity of conferring grace) is only\na necessary condition on the outcome of human free choices need to\ntell a more subtle story, on which omnipotent God\u2019s cooperative\nactivity can be (explanatorily) prior to a human choice and yet the\noutcome of that choice be settled only by the choice itself. For\nimportant medieval discussions\u2014the apex of philosophical\nreflection on theological concerns\u2014see the relevant portions of\nAl-Ghazali IP, Aquinas BW and Scotus QAM.\nThree positions (given in order of logical strength) on God\u2019s\nactivity vis-\u00e0-vis creaturely activity were variously defended\nby thinkers of this area: mere conservationism, concurrentism, and\noccasionalism. These positions turn on subtle distinctions, which have\nrecently been explored by Freddoso (1988), Kvanvig and McCann (1991),\nKoons (2002), Grant (2016 and 2019), and Judisch (2016).\n\nMany suppose that there is a challenge to human freedom stemming not\nonly from God\u2019s perfect power but also from his perfect\nknowledge. A standard argument for the incompatibility of free will\nand causal determinism has a close theological analogue. Recall van\nInwagen\u2019s influential formulation of the \u2018Consequence\nArgument\u2019:\n\n\nIf determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws\nof nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what\nwent on before we were born, and neither is it up to us what the laws\nof nature are. Therefore, the consequences of these things (including\nour present acts) are not up to us. (van Inwagen 1983, 16)\n\n\nAnd now consider an argument that turns on God\u2019s comprehensive\nand infallible knowledge of the future:\n\n\nIf infallible divine foreknowledge is true, then our acts are the\n(logical) consequences of God\u2019s beliefs in the remote past.\n(Since God cannot get things wrong, his believing that\nsomething will be so entails that it will be so.) But it is not up to\nus what beliefs God had before we were born, and neither is it up to\nus that God\u2019s beliefs are necessarily true. Therefore, the\nconsequences of these things (including our present acts) are not up\nto us.\n\n\nAn excellent discussion of these arguments in tandem and attempts to\npoint to relevant disanalogies between causal determinism and\ninfallible foreknowledge may be found in the introduction to Fischer\n(1989). See also the entry on\n foreknowledge and free will.\n\n\nAnother issue concerns how knowledge of God, the ultimate Good, would\nimpact human freedom. Many philosophical theologians, especially the\nmedieval Aristotelians, were drawn to the idea that human beings\ncannot but will that which they take to be an unqualified good. (As\nnoted above, Duns Scotus is an exception to this consensus, as were\nOckham and Suarez subsequently, but their dissent is limited.) Hence,\nif there is an afterlife, in which humans \u2018see God face to\nface,\u2019 they will inevitably be drawn to Him. Following\nPascal, Murray (1993, 2002) argues that a good God would choose to\nmake His existence and character less than certain for human beings,\nfor the sake of preserving their freedom. (He will do so, the argument\ngoes, at least for a period of time in which human beings participate\nin their own character formation.) If it is a good for human beings\nthat they freely choose to respond in love to God and to act in\nobedience to His will, then God must maintain an \u2018epistemic\ndistance\u2019 from them lest they be overwhelmed by His goodness or\npower and respond out of necessity, rather than freedom. (See also the\nother essays in Howard-Snyder and Moser 2002.)\n\nIf it is true that God withholds our ability to be certain of his\nexistence for the sake of our freedom, then it is natural to conclude\nthat humans will lack freedom in heaven. And it is anyways common to\ntraditional Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theologies to maintain that\nhumans cannot sin in heaven. Even so, traditional Christian theology\nat least maintains that human persons in heaven are free. What sort of\nfreedom is in view here, and how does it relate to mundane freedom?\nTwo good recent discussions of these questions are Pawl and Timpe\n(2009) and Tamburro (2017).\n4.2 God\u2019s Freedom\n\nFinally, there is the question of the freedom of God himself. Perfect\ngoodness is an essential, not acquired, attribute of God. God cannot\nlie or be in any way immoral in His dealings with His creatures\n(appearances notwithstanding). Unless we take the minority position on\nwhich this is a trivial claim, since whatever God does\ndefinitionally counts as good, this appears to be a\nsignificant, inner constraint on God\u2019s freedom. Did we not\ncontemplate immediately above that human freedom would be curtailed by\nour having an unmistakable awareness of what is in fact the Good? And\nyet is it not passing strange to suppose that God should be less than\nperfectly free?\n\nOne suggested solution to this puzzle takes as its point of departure\nthe distinction noted in section 2.3 between the ability to do\notherwise and sourcehood, proposing that the core metaphysical feature\nof freedom is being the ultimate source, or originator, of one\u2019s\nchoices. For human beings or any created persons who owe their\nexistence to factors outside themselves, the only way their acts of\nwill could find their ultimate origin in themselves is for such acts\nnot to be determined by their character and circumstances. For if all\nmy willings were wholly determined, then if we were to trace my causal\nhistory back far enough, we would ultimately arrive at external\nfactors that gave rise to me, with my particular genetic dispositions.\nMy motives at the time would not be the ultimate source of my\nwillings, only the most proximate ones. Only by there being\nless than deterministic connections between external influences and\nchoices, then, is it be possible for me to be an ultimate source of my\nactivity, concerning which I may truly say, \u201cthe buck stops\nhere.\u201d\n\nAs is generally the case, things are different on this point in the\ncase of God. As Anselm observed, even if God\u2019s character\nabsolutely precludes His performing certain actions in certain\ncontexts, this will not imply that some external factor is in any way\na partial origin of His willings and refrainings from willing. Indeed,\nthis would not be so even if he were determined by character to will\neverything which He wills. God\u2019s nature owes its\nexistence to nothing. Thus, God would be the sole and ultimate source\nof His will even if He couldn\u2019t will otherwise.\n\nWell, then, might God have willed otherwise in any respect?\nThe majority view in the history of philosophical theology is that He\nindeed could have. He might have chosen not to create anything at all.\nAnd given that He did create, He might have created any number of\nalternatives to what we observe. But there have been noteworthy\nthinkers who argued the contrary position, along with others who\nclearly felt the pull of the contrary position even while resisting\nit. The most famous such thinker is Leibniz (1710 [1985]), who argued\nthat God, being both perfectly good and perfectly powerful, cannot\nfail to will the best possible world. Leibniz insisted that this is\nconsistent with saying that God is able to will otherwise, although\nhis defense of this last claim is notoriously difficult to make out\nsatisfactorily. Many read Leibniz, malgr\u00e9 lui, as one\nwhose basic commitments imply that God could not have willed other\nthan He does in any respect.\n\nOne might challenge Leibniz\u2019s reasoning on this point by\nquestioning the assumption that there is a uniquely best possible\nCreation (an option noted by Adams 1987, though he challenges instead\nLeibniz\u2019s conclusion based on it). One way this could be is if\nthere is no well-ordering of worlds: some pairs of worlds are\nsufficiently different in kind that they are incommensurate with each\nother (neither is better than the other, nor are they equal) and no\nworld is better than either of them. Another way this could be is if\nthere is no upper limit on goodness of worlds: for every possible\nworld God might have created, there are others (infinitely many, in\nfact) which are better. If such is the case, one might argue, it is\nreasonable for God to arbitrarily choose which world to create from\namong those worlds exceeding some threshold value of overall\ngoodness.\n\nHowever, William Rowe (2004) has countered that the thesis that there\nis no upper limit on goodness of worlds has a very different\nconsequence: it shows that there could not be a morally perfect\nCreator! For suppose our world has an on-balance moral value of \\(n\\)\nand that God chose to create it despite being aware of possibilities\nhaving values higher than \\(n\\) that He was able to create. It seems\nwe can now imagine a morally better Creator: one having the same\noptions who chooses to create a better world. For critical replies to\nRowe, see Almeida (2008, ch. 1), Kray (2010), and Zimmerman (2018).\n\nFinally, Norman Kretzmann (1997, 220\u201325) has argued in the\ncontext of Aquinas\u2019s theological system that there is strong\npressure to say that God must have created something or other, though\nit may well have been open to Him to create any of a number of\ncontingent orders. The reason is that there is no plausible account of\nhow an absolutely perfect God might have a resistible\nmotivation\u2014one consideration among other, competing\nconsiderations\u2014for creating something rather than nothing. (It\nobviously cannot have to do with any sort of utility, for example.)\nThe best general understanding of God\u2019s being motivated to\ncreate at all\u2014one which in places Aquinas himself comes very\nclose to endorsing\u2014is to see it as reflecting the fact that\nGod\u2019s very being, which is goodness, necessarily diffuses\nitself. Perfect goodness will naturally communicate itself outwardly;\nGod who is perfect goodness will naturally create, generating a\ndependent reality that imperfectly reflects that goodness. Wainwright\n(1996) discusses a somewhat similar line of thought in the Puritan\nthinker Jonathan Edwards. Alexander Pruss (2016), however, raises\nsubstantial grounds for doubt concerning this line of thought;\nO\u2019Connor (2022) offers a rejoinder. \n",
