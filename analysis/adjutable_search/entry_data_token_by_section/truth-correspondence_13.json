    "main_text": "The Correspondence Theory and Its Competitors || Traditional Competitors\n8.1 Traditional Competitors\n\n\nAgainst the traditional competitors\u2014coherentist,\npragmatist, and verificationist and other epistemic theories of\ntruth\u2014correspondence theorists raise two main sorts of\nobjections. First, such accounts tend to lead into\nrelativism. Take, e.g., a coherentist account of truth. Since it is\npossible that \u2018p\u2019 coheres with the belief system\nof S while \u2018not-p\u2019 coheres with the\nbelief system of S*, the coherentist account seems to imply,\nabsurdly, that contradictories, \u2018p\u2019 and\n\u2018not-p\u2019, could both be true. To avoid embracing\ncontradictions, coherentists often commit themselves (if only\ncovertly) to the objectionable relativistic view that\n\u2018p\u2019 is true-for-S and\n\u2018not-p\u2019 is true-for-S*. Second,\nthe accounts tend to lead into some form of idealism or anti-realism,\ne.g., it is possible for the belief that p to cohere with\nsomeone\u2019s belief system, even though it is not a fact that\np; also, it is possible for it to be a fact that p,\neven if no one believes that p at all or if the belief does\nnot cohere with anyone\u2019s belief system. Cases of this sort are\nfrequently cited as counterexamples to coherentist accounts of\ntruth. Dedicated coherentists tend to reject such counterexamples,\ninsisting that they are not possible after all. Since it is hard to\nsee why they would not be possible, unless its being a fact that\np were determined by the belief\u2019s coherence with other\nbeliefs, this reaction commits them to the anti-realist view that the\nfacts are (largely) determined by what we believe.\n\n\nThis offers a bare outline of the overall shape the debates tend to\ntake. For more on the correspondence theory vs. its traditional\ncompetitors see, e.g., Vision 1988; Kirkham 1992, chaps. 3, 7-8;\nSchmitt 1995; K\u00fcnne 2003, chap. 7; and essays in Lynch\n2001. Walker 1989 is a book-lenght discussion of coherence theories of\ntruth. See also the entries on\n pragmatism,\n relativism,\n the coherence theory of truth, \nin this encyclopedia.\n",
