    "main_text": "\n\nFrom an early age, humans exhibit a tendency to identify, adopt, and\nenforce the norms of their local communities. Norms are the social\nrules that mark out what is appropriate, allowed, required, or\nforbidden in different situations for various community members. These\nrules are informal in the sense that although they are sometimes\nrepresented in formal laws, such as the rule governing which side of\nthe road to drive on, they need not be explicitly codified to\neffectively influence behavior. There are rules that forbid theft or\nthe breaking of promises, but also rules which govern how close it is\nappropriate to stand to someone while talking to them, or how loud one\nshould talk during the conversation. Thus understood, norms regulate a\nwide range of activity. They exhibit cultural variability in their\nprescriptions and proscriptions, but the presence of norms in general\nappears to be culturally universal. Some norms exhibit characteristics\nthat are often associated with morality, such as a rule that applies\nto everyone and prohibits causing unnecessary harm. Other norms apply\nonly to certain people, such as those that delimit appropriate\nclothing for members of different genders, or those concerning the\nexpectations and responsibilities ascribed to individuals who occupy\npositions of leadership. The norms that prevail in a community can be\nmore or less fair, reasonable, or impartial, and can be subject to\ncritique and change.\n\nThis entry provides an overview of interdisciplinary research into the\npsychological capacity for norm-guided cognition, motivation, and\nbehavior. The notions of a norm and normativity occur in an enormous\nrange of research that spans the humanities and behavioral sciences.\nResearchers primarily concerned with the psychology distinctive of\nnorm-governed behavior take what can be called\n\u201ccognitive-evolutionary\u201d approaches to their subject\nmatter. These approaches, common in the cognitive sciences, draw on a\nvariety of resources and evidence to investigate different\npsychological capacities. This entry describes how these have been\nused to construct accounts of those cognitive and motivational\nfeatures of minds that underpin the capacity to acquire, conform to,\nand enforce norms. It also describes how theories of the selective\npressures and adaptive challenges prominent in recent human evolution\nhave helped to inform and constrain theorizing about this\npsychological capacity, as well as how its features can influence the\ntransmission and cultural evolution of norms.\n\nBy way of organization, the entry starts with basics and proceeds to\nadd subsequent layers of intricacy and detail. Researchers taking\ncognitive-evolutionary approaches to norms come from a wide range of\ndisciplines, and have formulated, explored, and debated positions on a\nlarge number of different issues. In order to present a comprehensible\noverview of these interconnected literatures, the entry starts by\nlaying out main contours and central tenets, the key landmarks in the\nconceptual space common to different theories and claims. It goes on\nto provide a more detailed description of the kinds of theoretical\nresources that researchers have employed, and identifies important\ndimensions along which more specific accounts of the psychology of\nnorms have varied. It then canvasses different sources of empirical\nevidence that have begun to illuminate other philosophically\ninteresting features of the capacity for norms. Finally, it ends with\na discussion of the relationship between norm cognition and morality,\nwith a few illustrations drawn from recent debates in moral\ntheory.\n",
