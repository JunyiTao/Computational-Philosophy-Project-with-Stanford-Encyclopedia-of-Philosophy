    "main_text": "Heisenberg || Mathematical elaboration\n2.5 Mathematical elaboration\n\nWhen Heisenberg introduced his relation, his argument was based only\non qualitative examples. He did not provide a general, exact\nderivation of his\n relations.[3]\n Indeed, he did not even give a definition of the uncertainties\n\\(\\delta q\\), etc., occurring in these relations. Of course, this was\nconsistent with the announced goal of that paper, i.e., to provide\nsome qualitative understanding of quantum mechanics for simple\nexperiments.\n\nThe first mathematically exact formulation of the uncertainty\nrelations is due to Kennard. He proved in 1927 the theorem that for\nall normalized state vectors \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) the following\ninequality holds:\n \n\\[\\tag{9} \n\\Delta_{\\psi}\\bP \\Delta_{\\psi}\\bQ \\ge \\hslash/2 \\]\n\n\nHere, \\(\\Delta_{\\psi}\\bP\\) and\n\\(\\Delta_{\\psi}\\bQ\\) are standard deviations of position\nand momentum in the state vector \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\), i.e.,\n\n\\[\\tag{10}\n\\begin{align*}\n(\\Delta_{\\psi}\\bP)^2 &=   \n  \\expval{\\bP^2}_{\\psi} - \\expval{\\bP}_{\\psi}^2 \\\\\n(\\Delta_{\\psi}\\bQ)^2 &=  \n  \\expval{\\bQ^2}_{\\psi} - \\expval{\\bQ}_{\\psi}^2\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n where \\(\\expval{\\cdot}_{\\psi} = \\expvalexp{\\cdot}{\\psi}\\)\ndenotes the expectation value\nin state \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\). Equivalently we can use the wave\nfunction \\(\\psi(q)\\) and its Fourier transform: \n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \n\\tag{11} \\psi(q) &= \\braket{q}{\\psi} \\\\\n\\notag \\tilde{\\psi}(p) & = \\braket{p}{\\psi} \n   =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\hbar} }\\int \\! \\! dq\\, e^{-ipq/\\hbar} \\psi(q) \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n to write\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \n(\\Delta_\\psi {\\bQ})^2 & = \\! \\int\\!\\! dq\\, \\abs{\\psi(q)}^2 q^2 - \n  \\left(\\int \\!\\!dq \\, \\abs{\\psi(q)}^2 q \\right)^2 \\\\ \n(\\Delta_\\psi {\\bP})^2 & = \\! \\int \\!\\!dp \\, \\abs{\\tilde{\\psi}(p)}^2 p^2 - \n  \\left(\\int\\!\\!dp \\, \\abs{\\tilde{\\psi}(p)}^2 p \\right)^2 \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n The inequality\n (9)\n was generalized by Robertson (1929) who proved that for all\nobservables (self-adjoint operators) \\(\\bA\\) and\n\\(\\bB\\): \n\n\\[\\tag{12} \n\\Delta _{\\psi}\\bA \\Delta_{\\psi}\\bB \\ge \n  \\frac{1}{2} \\abs{\\expval{[\\bA,\\bB]}_{\\psi}}\n\\]\n\n where \\([\\bA,\\bB] := \\bA\\bB - \\bB\\bA\\) denotes the commutator.\n\nSince the above inequalities\n (9)\n and\n (12)\n have the virtue of being exact, in contrast to Heisenberg\u2019s\noriginal semi-quantitative formulation, it is tempting to regard them\nas the exact counterpart of Heisenberg\u2019s relations\n (2)\u2013(4).\n Indeed, such was Heisenberg\u2019s own view. In his Chicago Lectures\n(Heisenberg 1930: 15\u201319), he presented Kennard\u2019s\nderivation of relation\n (9)\n and claimed that \u201cthis proof does not differ at all in\nmathematical content\u201d from his semi-quantitative argument, the\nonly difference being that now \u201cthe proof is carried through\nexactly\u201d.\n\nBut it may be useful to point out that both in status and intended\nrole there is a difference between Kennard\u2019s inequality and\nHeisenberg\u2019s previous formulation\n (2).\n The inequalities discussed here are not statements of empirical fact,\nbut theorems of the quantum mechanical formalism. As such, they\npresuppose the validity of this formalism, and in particular the\ncommutation relation\n (1),\n rather than elucidating its intuitive content or to create\n\u201croom\u201d or \u201cfreedom\u201d for the validity of this\nformalism. At best, one should see the above inequalities as showing\nthat the formalism is consistent with Heisenberg\u2019s empirical\nprinciple.\n\nThis situation is similar to that arising in other theories of\nprinciple where, as noted in\n Section 2.4,\n one often finds that, next to an empirical principle, the formalism\nalso provides a corresponding theorem. And similarly, this situation\nshould not, by itself, cast doubt on the question whether\nHeisenberg\u2019s relation can be regarded as a principle of quantum\nmechanics.\n\nThere is a second notable difference between\n (2)\n and\n (9).\n Heisenberg did not give a general definition for the\n\u201cuncertainties\u201d \\(\\delta p\\) and \\(\\delta q\\). The most\ndefinite remark he made about them was that they could be taken as\n\u201csomething like the mean error\u201d. In the discussions of\nthought experiments, he and Bohr would always quantify uncertainties\non a case-to-case basis by choosing some parameters which happened to\nbe relevant to the experiment at hand. By contrast, the inequalities\n (9)\n and\n (12)\n employ a single specific expression as a measure for\n\u201cuncertainty\u201d: the standard deviation. At the time, this\nchoice was not unnatural, given that this expression is well-known and\nwidely used in error theory and the description of statistical\nfluctuations. However, there was very little or no discussion of\nwhether this choice was appropriate for a general formulation of the\nuncertainty relations. A standard deviation reflects the spread or\nexpected fluctuations in a series of measurements of an observable in\na given state. It is not at all easy to connect this idea with the\nconcept of the \u201cinaccuracy\u201d of a measurement, such as the\nresolving power of a microscope. In fact, even though Heisenberg had\ntaken Kennard\u2019s inequality as the precise formulation of the\nuncertainty relation, he and Bohr never relied on standard deviations\nin their many discussions of thought experiments, and indeed, it has\nbeen shown (Uffink and Hilgevoord 1985; Hilgevoord and Uffink 1988)\nthat these discussions cannot be framed in terms of standard\ndeviations.\n\nAnother problem with the above elaboration is that the\n\u201cwell-known\u201d relations\n (5)\n are actually false if energy \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) and action\n\\(\\boldsymbol{J}\\) are to be positive operators (Jordan 1927). In that\ncase, self-adjoint operators \\(\\boldsymbol{t}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{w}\\)\ndo not exist and inequalities analogous to\n (9)\n cannot be derived. Also, these inequalities do not hold for angle and\nangular momentum (Uffink 1990). These obstacles have led to a quite\nextensive literature on time-energy and angle-action uncertainty\nrelations (Busch 1990; Hilgevoord 1996, 1998, 2005; Muga et al. 2002;\nHilgevoord and Atkinson 2011; Pashby 2015).\n",
