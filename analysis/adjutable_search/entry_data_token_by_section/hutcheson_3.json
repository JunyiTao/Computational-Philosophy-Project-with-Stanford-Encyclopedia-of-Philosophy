    "main_text": "Hutcheson\u2019s Metaethics || Semantics and Moral Ontology\n1.3 Semantics and Moral Ontology\n\nGiven Hutcheson\u2019s insistence that the operation of our various\nsenses \u201cdetermines\u201d the various evaluative modes,\nit\u2019s clear that he is marked out as a sentimentalist in some\nform or other. But how should we understand Hutcheson\u2019s\nsentimentalism more precisely? Several questions arise.\n\nFirst, we might ask a semantic question. Can we take Hutcheson, in\nexpressing his view, to be a proto-non-cognitivist? In other words, is\nit the case that when people make moral utterances, they are simply\nexpressing their attitudes? Second, we might ask an ontological or\nmetaphysical question. Can we take Hutcheson to regard his moral\nmetaphysics as response-dependent (i.e., that moral properties just\nare the properties of eliciting certain responses), or is his view\ncompatible (or does it even express) some kind of realism about moral\nproperties?\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the question of whether Hutcheson is a\nnon-cognitivist. Now, of course, much depends on what one means by\nthis. But for the purpose of fixing our discussion, treat\nnon-cognitivism as a sematic thesis, according to which moral terms do\nnot refer to specific properties or objects, but are rather the\nexpression of a particular non-cognitive (such as conative, affective,\nand so on) attitude. And, indeed, there are some who read Hutcheson in\njust this way. Perhaps most famously, William Frankena writes:\n\n\nAs I read Hutcheson, then, his position is this: in passing moral\napprobation as such on an action I am not cognizing and ascribing any\nidentifiable property of goodness, etc., in or to the action, and I am\nnot cognizing or asserting any fact about the actual or possible\nreactions of any spectators to the action. I am simply feeling a\nunique sort of pleasure in contemplating the action, and I am\nexpressing this feeling by my verbal utterance, perhaps also\nexpressing (but not asserting) a conviction that others will feel this\npleasure if similarly situated, and almost certainly intending to\nevoke similar feelings in my hearers. That is, my moral approbation as\nsuch is wholly non-cognitive, very much as it is on Ayer\u2019s more\nrecent view, except that Ayer does not bring in a unique unacquired\nmoral sense as the source of the feelings involved. (Frankena 1955:\n372)\n\n\nWhy think this? Frankena mentions that Hutcheson specifically notes\nthat our moral sense is a determination to \u201creceive\npleasure\u201d independently of any further ideas: \n\n\nWe are not to imagine, that this moral Sense, more than the other\nsenses, supposes any innate Ideas, Knowledge, or practical\nProposition: We mean by it only a Determination of our Minds to\nreceive amiable or disagreeable Ideas of Actions, when they occur to\nour Observation, antecedent to any Opinions of Advantage or loss to\nredound to our selves from them. (Inquiry, 100) \n\n\nHere it would appear that Hutcheson identifies the \u201camiable or\ndisagreeable Ideas\u201d as the \u201cimmediate Pleasure\u201d\ngained as a result of the operation of the moral sense. If so, it\nwould make some sense to say that Hutcheson holds that when making\nmoral judgments, one is simply expressing the affective attitudes,\ni.e., pleasure, that one gains as a result of the operation of the\nmoral sense.\n\nHowever, on balance Hutcheson\u2019s text does not permit of this reading.\n(For a much more thorough rejection of such a reading, see Darwall\n1995: ch. 8; esp. 215\u201316; Kupperman 1985) Recall again his\npassage from the opening of the Essay: \n\n\nObjects, Actions, or Events obtain the Name of Good, or\nEvil, according as they are the Causes, or Occasions,\nmediately, or immediately, of a grateful, or ungrateful\nPerception to some sensitive Nature. \n\n\nHutcheson does not claim that the property, say,\n\u201cgoodness\u201d, or our expressions of such a property just\nare expressions of our sensitive responses to such objects.\nBut, rather, the property of goodness identified in such objects is\nthe property of being a \u201cCause or Occasion\u201d of such\nreactions. A similar thought is expressed in the opening passages of\nthe Inquiry: \n\n\nThe Word Moral Goodness, in this Treatise, denotes our Idea of some\nQuality apprehended in Actions, which procures Approbation, and Love\ntoward the Actor, from those who receive no Advantage by the Action.\n(Inquiry, 85) \n\n\nFrankena dismisses this passage by noting that Hutcheson, in the next\nsentence, holds that these are \u201cImperfect Descriptions\u201d\n(Frankena 1955: 368). But Hutcheson does not believe that they are\n\u201cImperfect\u201d in the sense of being\nincorrect\u2014rather, he holds that these descriptions are\nimperfect in the sense requiring additional evidence and argument,\ni.e., \n\n\nuntil we discover whether we really have such Ideas, and what general\nFoundation there is in Nature for this Difference of actions, as\nmorally Good or Evil.\n\n\nThus it seems that we shouldn\u2019t accept that Hutcheson is a\nnon-cognitivist in the sense meant by Frankena. For Hutcheson, moral\ngoodness (and, presumably, the other evaluative modes) refers to\nparticular properties. However, at this point we may wish to turn to\nthe nature of these properties. What sort of property is moral\ngoodness or evil? The key question is the manner in which the moral\nsense \u201cdetermines\u201d moral distinctions (Radcliffe 1986).\nThough this is a bit of a coarse-grained division, one could\ndistinguish what we might call \u201cconstitutive\nsentimentalism\u201d, according to which the property referred to by\nthe term \u201cgood\u201d just is the property of causing the\nrelevant sentiments in observers. Contrast this with \u201cepistemic\nsentimentalism\u201d, according to which the properties referred to\nby the term \u201cgood\u201d are independent of the moral sense, but\nit is nevertheless the operation of the moral sense that allows us to\nascertain or recognize these properties (Raphael 1947).\n\nIndeed, it is not immediately clear from the Inquiry how we\nare to read Hutcheson on this matter. As already quoted, he holds that\nthe moral sense is the source of the ideas of moral good and\nbad (Inquiry 86). But this would appear to be neutral\nconcerning whether Hutcheson is a constitutive or epistemic\nsentimentalist. However, the passage from the Essay is less\nambiguous. As noted, he holds that objects, actions, and so on\n\u201cobtain the name Good\u201d insofar as they are\ncauses of the relevant perceptions (Essay, 15). And\nhence this would appear to be a constitutive sentimentalism: moral\nproperties just are those properties that cause a particular\nsentimental reaction. On this reading (or so it would seem), if our\npsychology were different, then it may be that those things that\n\u201cprocure Approbation\u201d would be substantially different\nthan what they are now. This consequence was a key contemporary\ncriticism of Hutcheson. John Balguy, for instance, writes \n\n\nIn the first place, it seems an insuperable difficulty in our\nauthor\u2019s scheme, that virtue appears in it to be of an arbitrary\nand positive nature, as entirely depending upon instincts,\nthat might originally have been otherwise, or even contrary to what\nthey now are, and may be at any time altered or inverted, if the\nCreator pleases. (Balguy 1728 [BM: 390])\n\n\nHowever, there are two further points worth making here, as we come to\nunderstand Hutcheson\u2019s moral ontology. First, even if it were\nthe case that Hutcheson accepted a kind of constitutive\nsentimentalism, Hutcheson nevertheless believes that the property of\ngoodness could not have been otherwise. This is for two\nreasons. First, Hutcheson believes that our capacity for approbation,\nand our capacity to take pleasure in particular actions given the\nmoral sense is firmly rooted in the universal principles of human\nnature:\n\n\nBut if we call \u201cthat State, those Dispositions\nand Actions, natural, to which we are inclined by\nsome part of our Constitution, antecedently to any Volition of our\nown; or which flow from some Principles in our Nature,\nnot brought upon us by our own Art, or that of others;\u201d\nthen it may appear, from what has been said above, that \u201ca State\nof Good-will, Humanity, Compassion, mutual Aid, propagating and\nsupporting Offspring, Love of a Community or Country, Devotion, or\nLove and Gratitude to some governing Mind, is our natural\nState\u201d. (Essay, 130)\n\n\nFurthermore, Hutcheson seems to believe that only the fundamental\nprinciples of human nature maintain moral authority. He writes, in the\nInquiry:\n\n\nAll Men seem persuaded of some Excellency in the Possession of good\nmoral Qualitys, which is superior to all other Enjoyments; and on the\ncontrary, look upon a State of moral Evil, as worse and more wretched\nthan any other whatsoever. We must not form our Judgment in this\nmatter from the Actions of Men; for however they may be\ninfluenc\u2019d by moral Sentiments, yet it is certain, that\nSelf-interested Passions frequently overcome them, and partial Views\nof the Tendency of Actions, make us do what is really morally evil,\napprehending it to be good. But let us examine the Sentiments which\nMen universally form of the State of others, when they are no way\nimmediately concern\u2019d; for in these Sentiments human Nature is\ncalm and undisturb\u2019d, and shews its true Face.\n(Inquiry, 163\u20134)\n\n\nAnd the root of our moral sentiments in human nature is further\nevidence that morality is not, as suggested by Balguy, arbitrary. This\nis because, after all, we are created by a benevolent deity (Rauscher\n2003). And no benevolent deity would have chosen to impart a\ndisposition to praise, e.g., ill-will, cruelty, pain, hatred, and so\nforth as principles of human nature (Essay 132). (Indeed,\nthis passage reveals a key error in Frankena\u2019s criticism of a\n\u201csubjectivist\u201d, rather than non-cognitivist, approach to\nHutcheson\u2019s metaethics. According to Frankena, the subjectivist\nview is \n\n\nincomplete. For it should include a statistical investigation into the\nactual or possible incidence of feelings of pleasure or pain at\ncontemplating the act in question among the preliminaries to a moral\njudgment. (Frankena 1955: 371) \n\n\nBut Frankena fails to recognize that Hutcheson does conduct\nthis statistical inquiry. He holds that the sentiments he is\ndescribing are universal principles of human nature, implanted by a\nbenevolent deity.) Of course, that\u2019s not to say that the deity\ncouldn\u2019t have made us different than we are\n(Inquiry, 80; Radcliffe 1986)\u2014just that the deity\nwouldn\u2019t have.\n\nSo if Hutcheson is a constitutive sentimentalist, it appears that his\nbrand of constitutive sentimentalism has at least had some responses\nto some common objections. After all, our responses are fixtures of\nhuman nature, so there needn\u2019t be any sort of problematic\ncontingency in the application of moral predicates.\n\nHowever, there is one slight complication that can and should be\nraised for the constitutive interpretation of Hutcheson. (Further to\nthis discussion, see Kail 2001.) Recall how we distinguish senses,\ni.e., via their subject matter. Now, as noted before, the\nmoral sense takes pleasure in actions. But so does, e.g., the sense of\ndignity or decency. Of course, this isn\u2019t any particular problem\nfor his account of sense individuation. After all, Hutcheson holds, in\nthe latter case, that it is the suitableness to human nature\nupon which the sense of dignity operates. This indicates that whether\nan action is suitable to human nature is independent of the operation\nof the sense of dignity. But note that Hutcheson also (at least\noccasionally) refers to the moral sense as a quality that perceives\nand operates upon virtue and vice (Essay, 17). Now,\nwere Hutcheson a constitutive sentimentalist, this would create a\nserious problem. After all, on a constitutive sentimentalist view,\nvirtue and vice is logically posterior to the operation of the moral\nsense, rendering any attempt at individuating that particular sense\ncircular. It would appear a better reading to hold that, as a\nperceptive quality, the moral sense is perceiving and reacting to\nsomething, viz., virtue and vice, telling in favor of an\nepistemic rather than constitutive reading of Hutcheson\u2019s\nsentimentalism.\n\nIn further support of an epistemic reading, consider the following\npassage from Hutcheson\u2019s A System of Moral Philosophy.\nHere, Hutcheson writes the following:\n\n\nTho\u2019 the approbation of moral excellence is a grateful action or\nsensation of the mind, \u2019tis plain the good approved is not this\ntendency to give us a grateful sensation. As, in approving a beautiful\nform, we refer to the beauty of the object; we do not say that it is\nbeautiful because we reap some little pleasure in viewing it, but we\nare pleased in viewing it because it is antecedently beautiful. Thus,\nwhen we admire the virtue of another, the whole excellence, or that\nquality which by nature we are determined to approve, is conceived to\nbe in that other; we are pleased in the contemplation because the\nobject is excellent, and the object is not judged to be therefore\nexcellent because it gives us pleasure. (System, 54; see also\nNorton 1985: 410)\n\n\nNow, this seems to be a direct rejection of his view, expressed in the\nEssay, that goodness just is the cause or occasion\nof a \u201cgrateful Perception\u201d. Rather, or so it would appear\nhere, Hutcheson seems to be holding that the goodness is a real\nproperty of the object, which we feel pleasure upon contemplating,\njust as beauty is a real property of a particular object, which we\nfeel pleasure upon seeing or appreciating. This clearly tells in favor\nof an epistemic rather than a constitutive sentimentalism.\n\nOne might hold that Hutcheson, by the time he wrote the\nSystem, had changed his view. Indeed, the\nEssay\u2019s first edition was published in 1728, and the\nSystem was a much later book, left unpublished at the time of\nhis death. A standard view is that Hutcheson\u2019s thinking changed\nsubstantially once we reach the System (Carey 2005:\nv\u2013vi; Scott 1900: 214). However, this explanation is\nsomewhat unsatisfactory, for at least one reason. Hutcheson was a\nperennial tinkerer. The Essay underwent no fewer than three\nseparate revised editions during Hutcheson\u2019s lifetime. The\nfinal, third, edition of the Essay was completed and\npublished in 1742. But the System, while it was not published\nuntil after Hutcheson\u2019s death in 1755, was substantially\ncomplete by 1737, five years earlier than the final revised\nedition of the Essay. And hence were Hutcheson to have\nchanged his view concerning the nature of the property of goodness,\none would certainly expect to see this change reflected in the text of\nthe Essay, which was revised as of 1742. But one\ndoesn\u2019t. (This is especially striking given that Hutcheson was\nnot shy about making very substantive changes in later editions of his\nwork; this is especially true of the four editions of the\nInquiry.)\n\nThis, therefore, is an exegetical puzzle.  However, progress may be made by reconsidering Hutcheson\u2019s passage from the Essay. He writes\nthat objects, etc.,\u201cobtain the Name of Good\u201d\ngiven their capacity to cause pleasurable sensations. Notice the word\n\u201cobtain\u201d. We might read Hutcheson as saying not that the\nproperty of goodness is the tendency to cause feelings of\napprobation or feelings of pleasure, but rather the property of\ngoodness is one to which we have access given our feelings of\npleasure, just in the sense that beauty is a property to which we have\naccess given our feelings of pleasure in contemplation of the\nbeautiful object. Our feelings of pleasure, in this way, serve to\nfix the reference of the term \u201cgoodness\u201d, but do\nnot constitute the referent of that term. In other words,\nmoral goodness just is the property of XYZ, but we\n\u201capprehend\u201d that property given our affective responses\nand the operation of the moral sense. For Hutcheson, the pleasure\ngenerated by the moral sense operates in an analogous way that the\ndescription of an object operates in a causal theory of reference.\n\u201cThe author of The Shining\u201d fixes the reference\nof \u201cStephen King\u201d, but the property of being Stephen\nKing is not the property of being the author of The\nShining. Similarly, that which has a tendency to cause\napprobation fixes the reference of moral goodness, but being the\nproperty of moral goodness is not the same as being the disposition to\ncause approbation. For Hutcheson, the property is independent.\n",
