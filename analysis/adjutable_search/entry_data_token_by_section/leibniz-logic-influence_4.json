    "main_text": "Second Wave of Reception || The Impact of Erdmann\u2019s Edition\n3.2 The Impact of Erdmann\u2019s Edition\n\n\nErdmann\u2019s edition immediately stimulated further research on\nLeibniz\u2019s logic. Gottschalk Eduard Guhrauer criticized\nextensively Leibniz\u2019s universal characteristic in the first\nvolume of his biography of Leibniz (Guhrauer 1846). He stressed its\nabsurd and utopian character: According to Guhrauer, Leibniz\u2019s\ngeneral characteristic must almost be seen as on a par with the\nphilosopher\u2019s stone and the secrets of producing gold.\n\n\nIn a paper on \u201c\u00dcber Leibnitz\u2019ens\nUniversal-Wissenschaft,\u201d (1843) the Austrian philosopher Franz\nExner referred explicitly to Erdmann\u2019s edition. For Exner, the\nedition throws a brighter light on Leibniz\u2019s conception of a\nuniversal science. Even though in Exner\u2019s opinion it had its\nweaknesses, he predicted a healthy impact on philosophy. He wrote\n(Exner 1843, 39):\n\n\nFor him [Leibniz], the universal science is the true logic; both,\nuniversal science and logic, are the arts of judgment and invention;\nwriting mathematically means for him writing in forma, which\nhe believes to be possible outside mathematics; for him, the logical\nform of reasoning is a calculus; formulas, relations and operations of\nhis universal science correlate with concepts, judgments and inferences\nof his logic; finally, the second part of the universal science, the\nart of invention, is an epitome of relatively general methods. We\ncannot accuse him of having overestimated logic. It was not his opinion\nthat simple knowledge of logical rules would do great things, but its\napplication. In the application of logical rules, however, men who had\nthe knowledge of logical rules to a great extent had shown\nweaknesses.\nIn 1857 the Herbartian philosopher from Bohemia, Franti\u0161ek\nBolem\u00edr Kv\u011bt (1825\u20131864), published a booklet\nentitled Leibniz\u2019ens Logik. Kv\u011bt reconstructed the\nelements of Leibniz\u2019s scientia generalis stressing the\noriginality of their combination, but not of every single element. He\ndiscussed the \u201cextremely meager\u201d fragments concerning the\nphilosophical calculus. They showed, Kv\u011bt wrote, how far their\nauthor stood behind his aims. He dismissed Leibniz\u2019s ars\ninveniendi, calling it embarrassing because of its weaknesses,\ndefects and impossibility.\n",
