    "main_text": "\n\nThe philosophy of childhood has recently come to be recognized as an\narea of inquiry analogous to the philosophy of science, the philosophy\nof history, the philosophy of religion, and the many other\n\u201cphilosophy of\u201d subjects that are already considered\nlegitimate areas of philosophical study. In addition, philosophical\nstudy of related topics (such as parental rights, duties and\nresponsibilities) has flourished in recent years. The philosophy of\nchildhood takes up philosophically interesting questions about\nchildhood, changing conceptions over time about childhood and\nattitudes toward children; theories of cognitive and moral\ndevelopment; children\u2019s interests and children\u2019s rights,\nthe goods of childhood; children and autonomy; the moral status of\nchildren and the place of children in society. As an academic subject,\nthe philosophy of childhood is sometimes included within the\nphilosophy of education (e.g., Siegel, 2009). Recently, however,\nphilosophers have begun to offer college and university courses\nspecifically in the philosophy of childhood. And philosophical\nliterature on childhood, parenting and families is increasing in both\nquantity and quality.\n",
