Unfortunately, neither\npositive results (when the theory\u2019s predictions are borne out in\nthe data) nor negative results (when they are not) allow unambiguous\ninferences about the theory. A positive result can obtain even though\nthe theory is false, due to some alternative that makes the same\npredictions. Finding suspect Jones\u2019 fingerprints on the murder\nweapon is consistent with his innocence because he might have used it\nas a kitchen knife. A negative result might be due not to the\nfalsehood of the theory under test but due to the failing of one or\nmore auxiliary assumptions needed to derive a prediction from the\ntheory. Testing, let us say, the implications of Newton\u2019s laws\nfor movements in our planetary system against observations requires\nassumptions about the number of planets, the sun\u2019s and the\nplanets\u2019 masses, the extent to which the earth\u2019s\natmosphere refracts light beams, how telescopes affect the results and\nso on. Any of these may be false, explaining an inconsistency. The\nlocus classicus for these observations is Pierre\nDuhem\u2019s The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory (Duhem\n1906 [1954]). Duhem concluded that there was no \u201ccrucial\nexperiment\u201d, an experiment that conclusively decides between two\nalternative theories, in physics (1906 [1954: 188ff.]), and that\nphysicists had to employ their expert judgment or what Duhem called\n\u201cgood sense\u201d to determine what an experimental result\nmeans for the truth or falsehood of a theory (1906 [1954:\n216ff.]).\n\nIn other words, there is a gap between the evidence and the theory\nsupported by it. It is important to note that the alleged gap is more\nprofound than the gap between the premisses of any inductive\nargument and its conclusion, say, the gap between \u201cAll hitherto\nobserved ravens have been black\u201d and \u201cAll ravens are\nblack\u201d. The latter gap could be bridged by an agreed upon rule\nof inductive reasoning. Alas, all attempts to find an analogous rule\nfor theory choice have failed (e.g., Norton 2003). Various\nphilosophers, historians, and sociologists of science have responded\nthat theory appraisal is \u201ca complex form of value\njudgment\u201d (McMullin 1982: 701; see also Kuhn 1977; Hesse 1980;\nBloor 1982).\n\nIn\n section 3.1\n below we will discuss the nature of the value judgments in more\ndetail. For now the important lesson is that if these philosophers,\nhistorians, and sociologists are correct, the \u201cfaithfulness to\nfacts\u201d ideal is untenable. As the scientific image of the world\nis a joint product of the facts and scientists\u2019 value judgments,\nthat image cannot be said to be aperspectival. Science does not eschew\nthe human perspective. There are of course ways to escape this\nconclusion. If, as John Norton (2003; ms.\u2014see Other Internet\nResources) has argued, it is material facts that power and justify\ninductive inferences, and not value judgments, we can avoid the\nnegative conclusion regarding the view from nowhere. Unsurprisingly,\nNorton is also critical of the idea that evidence generally\nunderdetermines theory (Norton 2008). However, there are good reasons\nto mistrust Norton\u2019s optimism regarding the ineliminability of\nvalues and other non-factual elements in inductive inferences (Reiss\n2020).\n\nThere is another, closely related concern. Most of the earlier critics\nof \u201cobjective\u201d verification or falsification focused on\nthe relation between evidence and scientific theories. There is a\nsense in which the claim that this relation is problematic is not so\nsurprising. Scientific theories contain highly abstract claims that\ndescribe states of affairs far removed from the immediacy of sense\nexperience. This is for a good reason: sense experience is necessarily\nperspectival, so to the extent to which scientific theories are to\ntrack the absolute conception, they must describe a world different\nfrom that of sense experience. But surely, one might think, the\nevidence itself is objective. So even if we do have reasons to doubt\nthat abstract theories faithfully represent the world, we should stand\non firmer grounds when it comes to the evidence against which we test\nabstract theories.\n\nTheories are seldom tested against brute observations, however. Simple\ngeneralizations such as \u201call swans are white\u201d are directly\nlearned from observations (say, of the color of swans) but they do not\nrepresent the view from nowhere (for one thing, the view from nowhere\ndoesn\u2019t have colors). Genuine scientific theories are tested\nagainst experimental facts or phenomena, which are themselves\nunobservable to the unaided senses. Experimental facts or phenomena\nare instead established using intricate procedures of measurement and\nexperimentation.\n\nWe therefore need to ask whether the results of scientific\nmeasurements and experiments can be aperspectival. In an important\ndebate in the 1980s and 1990s some commentators answered that question\nwith a resounding \u201cno\u201d, which was then rebutted by others.\nThe debate concerns the so-called \u201cexperimenter\u2019s\nregress\u201d (Collins 1985). Collins, a prominent sociologist of\nscience, claims that in order to know whether an experimental result\nis correct, one first needs to know whether the apparatus producing\nthe result is reliable. But one doesn\u2019t know whether the\napparatus is reliable unless one knows that it produces correct\nresults in the first place and so on and so on ad infinitum.\nCollins\u2019 main case concerns attempts to detect gravitational\nwaves, which were very controversially discussed among physicists in\nthe 1970s.\n\nCollins argues that the circle is eventually broken not by the\n\u201cfacts\u201d themselves but rather by factors having to do with\nthe scientist\u2019s career, the social and cognitive interests of\nhis community, and the expected fruitfulness for future work. It is\nimportant to note that in Collins\u2019s view these factors do not\nnecessarily make scientific results arbitrary. But what he does argue\nis that the experimental results do not represent the world according\nto the absolute conception. Rather, they are produced jointly by the\nworld, scientific apparatuses, and the psychological and sociological\nfactors mentioned above. The facts and phenomena of science are\ntherefore necessarily perspectival.\n\nIn a series of contributions, Allan Franklin, a\nphysicist-turned-philosopher of science, has tried to show that while\nthere are indeed no algorithmic procedures for establishing\nexperimental facts, disagreements can nevertheless be settled by\nreasoned judgment on the basis of bona fide\nepistemological criteria such as experimental checks and calibration,\nelimination of possible sources of error, using apparatuses based on\nwell-corroborated theory and so on (Franklin 1994, 1997). Collins\nresponds that \u201creasonableness\u201d is a social category that\nis not drawn from physics (Collins 1994).\n\nThe main issue for us in this debate is whether there are any reasons\nto believe that experimental results provide an aperspectival view on\nthe world. According to Collins, experimental results are\nco-determined by the facts as well as social and psychological\nfactors. According to Franklin, whatever else influences experimental\nresults other than facts is not arbitrary but instead based on\nreasoned judgment. What he has not shown is that reasoned judgment\nguarantees that experimental results reflect the facts alone and are\ntherefore aperspectival in any interesting sense. Another important\nchallenge for the aperspectival account comes from feminist\nepistemology and other accounts that stress the importance of the\nconstruction of scientific knowledge through epistemic communities.\nThese accounts are reviewed in\n section 5.\n",
