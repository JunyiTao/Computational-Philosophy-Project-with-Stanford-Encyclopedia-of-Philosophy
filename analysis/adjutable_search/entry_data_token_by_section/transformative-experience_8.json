Epistemology: Can We Know What It\u2019s Like?\n\nEpistemically transformative experiences are experiences where one\ncannot know what they are like before having them. In the paradigm\ncase of parenthood, the experience of becoming a parent for the first\ntime has \u201can epistemically unique phenomenal character\u201d\n(Paul 2015a, 157). One cannot know what these are experiences are like\nprior to having them.\n\nPrior work, such as Jackson (1986), provides support for this\nepistemic claim. Jackson\u2019s \u201cWhat Mary Didn\u2019t\nKnow\u201d invites us to engage in a thought experiment about Mary, a\nperson who has lived in a black and white room her entire life. Prior\nto encountering color, can Mary know what it is like to see the color\nred? Does it matter whether Mary is a color scientist who has studied\nthe physics of color and read extensive testimonies about what the\ncolor red is like? Jackson\u2019s objective\u2014to show that\nphysicalism is false because it cannot give us knowledge of\nqualia\u2014applies to transformative experience as well. In general,\nexperiential, or \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d, knowledge cannot\nbe obtained prior to experience. Thus, what transformative experiences\nare like cannot be known without having the relevant experience.\n\nMany philosophers reject the claim that one cannot know what\ntransformative experiences are like prior to having them. These\nrejections tend to center upon one of two strategies. First, one might\nturn to paradigm cases such parenthood and offer reasons to believe\nthat one can in fact know quite a lot about what it\u2019s like to be\na parent prior to becoming one. For instance, Harman (2015) argues\nthat caring for a significantly younger sibling in a quasi-paternal\nway or witnessing a close friend or family member become a parent\nprovides at least some evidence regarding what becoming a\nparent is like. Krishnamurthy (2015, 180) offers a similar suggestion,\narguing that \u201cwe can on the basis of experiences of similar\ntypes know what it is like to have a child\u201d. For instance,\nbabysitting or raising a cat shares common elements with parenting.\nKnowing what these elements are like allows one to know something\nabout what being a parent is like.\n\nSharadin (2015) offers a variation of this type of strategy that\nfocuses on non-phenomenal elements of parenthood. For instance,\nbecoming a parent typically involves things like financial and sleep\ndeprivation, and we can know that becoming a parent typically\ninvolves these things. Plausibly, there is a supervenience relation\nbetween these non-phenomenal elements and an agent\u2019s phenomenal\nexperience of them. Further, many people, such as philosophy graduate\nstudents, are intimately familiar with the phenomenal experience of\nfinancial and sleep deprivation. By building upon the non-phenomenal\nelements that parenthood shares with other experiences a person has\nhad, that person can develop an idea of what parenthood is like prior\nto actually experiencing parenthood.\n\nSome empirical research work focusing on how people model uncertainty\nsuggests that people do in fact attempt to use this first strategy of\nbuilding on what one knows to figure out what one does not know.\nZimmerman and Ullman (2020, 73) model epistemic uncertainty and\npurportedly demonstrate that \u201cpeople can make informed decisions\nabout trying unfamiliar things\u201d. For instance, suppose that\nsomeone encounters an unfamiliar yellow grape. Though they\nwouldn\u2019t know what the yellow grape is like, they might appeal\nto their knowledge of what green and red grapes are like to form a\njudgment about what the yellow grape might be like. At the very least,\nit seems like they are justified in believing that the yellow grape\nwill not wildly diverge from their other grape experiences. Based on\nthis information, they can rationally choose to try the yellow grape.\nEven if they are completely unfamiliar with grapes, they might use\ntheir knowledge of other fruits to form an informed decision. In\ngeneral, novel experiences fall into a taxonomy of the types of\nexperiences one might have, and agents can use the next closest\nexperiences to project what the novel one might be like.\n\nEven if this strategy is successful, it\u2019s unclear that it shows\nthat we can know what transformative experiences are like prior to\nhaving them. Recall that transformative experiences are supposed to\nhave \u201cunique phenomenal character\u201d (Paul 2015a, 157). If one\nknows enough about what the experience is like, then it\u2019s not in\nfact transformative. For instance, Paul (2015b) responds to\nHarman\u2019s case by suggesting that through having similar enough\nexperiences, Harman might in fact have known what becoming a parent is\nlike. Thus, becoming a parent for the first time would not have been\ntransformative because the relevant transformative experience already\noccurred earlier. Whether a type of experience is transformative may\nbe agent-relative. Furthermore, while this strategy is promising, some\ncases may still elude it. For instance, when it comes to gaining or\nlosing a sense modality, it really does seem that the pre-transformed\nperson cannot have any relevantly similar experiences.\n\nThe second strategy does not deny that we often don\u2019t know what\ntransformative experiences are like. Rather, it locates our\nexperiential ignorance in a lack of imagination rather than an in\nprinciple difference in types of knowledge (i.e., propositional and\nexperiential knowledge). Kind (2020), for instance, argues that the\ndifference between projecting what transformative and\nnon-transformative experiences amounts to a difference of degree\nrather than kind. Plausibly, it\u2019s possible to imagine what\nit\u2019s like to babysit for the first time. Further, imagining what\nit\u2019s like to be a first-time babysitter might be easier than\nimagining what it\u2019s like to become first-time parent. For\nsomeone with a sufficiently good imagination\u2014and our imaginative\nabilities do also come in degrees\u2014one can gradually scale up\nfrom the babysitting experience to the experience of becoming a\nparent. It may even be that we can augment our imaginations through\naids such as art and thus approximate what foreign experiences are\nlike (see Aumann 2022). The effectiveness of artistic aids as well as\nthe understanding gained from them also plausibly admit of degrees.\nThus, the imagination strategy can explain why it\u2019s easier to\nfigure out what some experiences are like than others, and why this\ncan vary from individual to individual. Since paradigm transformative\nexperiences tend to be among the most difficult to imagine, positing\ndistinct \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d knowledge is tempting.\nHowever, the difficulty in imagining what paradigm transformative\nexperiences are like merely generates the appearance of a\ndistinct kind of knowledge. The upshot is that in principle, we can\nknow what a transformative experience is like prior to experiencing\nit.\n\nArpaly (2020) offers a wrinkle on the imagination strategy, blaming\nour \u201ccrappy\u201d imaginations for our inability to project\nwhat transformative experiences are like. Sometimes, what an\nexperience is like is opaque because the \u201cdevilish\ndetails\u201d of the experience simply haven\u2019t occurred to us.\nFor example, most people have not considered that if a giraffe were to\ndrink coffee, the coffee would cold by the time it reaches the\ngiraffe\u2019s stomach. Other times, we overestimate our ability to\nimagine things, and our overconfidence prevents us from accepting\ntestimony or other evidence that would be illuminating. These cases\ncan be tragic, such as when a depressed person\u2019s family\ndoesn\u2019t believe their reports of depression. The failure to\ncorrectly imagine what things would be like thus causes it to\nappear as if our lack of experience is the problem, since\nexperience would quickly correct this misimpression. Crucially, there\nis nothing special about the \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d\nquality of these experiences. Though we are ignorant, we are not in\nprinciple ignorant and could theoretically figure out what the\ntransformative experience would be like.\n\nLike the first strategy, this second one is most vulnerable when it\ncomes to extreme transformations in experience such as gaining or\nlosing a sense modality. One might also wonder whether the second\nstrategy significantly undermines the core epistemic claim: that one\ncannot know what transformative experiences are like prior to having\nthem. Even if there is no in principle difference propositional and\n\u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d knowledge, it does seem like\nimagination-based responses do acknowledge that some experiences elude\nour imaginative abilities.\n\nFinally, Moss (2018) offers an interestingly different defense of the\nclaim that we cannot know what a transformative experience is like\nprior to having it. Moss argues that we often have\n\u201cprobabilistic knowledge\u201d. For instance, suppose that 50%\nof the people who experience childbirth report that the experience is\nmiraculous. Based on that, it seems reasonable to conclude that there\nis a 50% chance that experiencing childbirth is miraculous. While an\nindividual can\u2019t know that the experience will be miraculous for\nthem, it does seem that they can know that there\u2019s a 50% chance\nthat the experience will be miraculous for them. But crucially, before\none knows that probabilistic claim, one must know that they\naren\u2019t exceptional. For instance, suppose it turns out that of\nthe people who decline epidurals, only 10% of them report that the\nchildbirth experience is miraculous. If one is going to decline an\nepidural, then they do not know that there\u2019s a 50% chance the\nexperience will be miraculous since they are part of a\ngroup\u2014what Moss (2018, 173) calls \u201can alternative reference\nclass\u201d\u2014for whom the probability does not apply.\nFurthermore, those who can\u2019t rule out that they are in the\nalternative reference class (in this case, perhaps those who are\nunsure of whether they will have an epidural) also lack probabilistic\nknowledge. Plausibly in the case of parenthood and other\ntransformative experiences, probabilistic claims can be formed based\non testimony gathered from those who have had the experience. However,\nit could be that among those giving the testimony, there is\nsignificant variance that\u2019s based on whether individuals belong\nto an alternative reference class. Given the nature of transformative\nexperience, it may be unobvious whether a particular individual has a\ntrait that places them into an alternative reference class. Thus, even\nif there\u2019s ample data regarding how likely it is to have a\nparticular parenting experience, that won\u2019t result in\nprobabilistic knowledge of what it\u2019s like to be a parent. This\ndefense also works even if it turns out that there isn\u2019t a\ndistinctive \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d knowledge and our\nimaginations can sometimes help us understand what foreign experiences\nare like.\n",
