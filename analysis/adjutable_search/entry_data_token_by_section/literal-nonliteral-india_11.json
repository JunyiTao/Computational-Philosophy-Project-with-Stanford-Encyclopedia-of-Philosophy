    "main_text": "Suggested Meaning and Speaker\u2019s Intention || Objections to Suggested Meaning\n3.3 Objections to Suggested Meaning\nAlthough \u0100nandavardhana\u2019s theory of suggested meaning was influential for many philosophers of aesthetics in the years following his Light on Suggestion, not everyone accepted the new model. There were two ways of rejecting suggestion: reducing it to a non-linguistic capacity or reducing it to an already-existing linguistic capacity\u2014primary or secondary meaning. The first strategy is followed, in different ways, by Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da N\u0101yaka and Mahima Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, whereas the second is followed by Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da and members of the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara school of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101.\nIn his Mirror of the Heart, Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da N\u0101yaka (ca. 900 CE) argues that \u0100nandavardhana is mistaken to think of rasa as something like linguistic meaning, and instead focuses on the emotional response of the reader (Pollock 2016, Ollett 2020). His argument is that rasa cannot be the kind of thing which is the meaning of a sentence\u2014it is an experiential event which is caused by sentences. Drawing on M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 hermeneutics, which emphasizes how Vedic language causes hearers to follow injunctions, Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da N\u0101yaka proposes a multi-part process in which the primary meaning function operates in a normal manner, but subsequently there is what Pollock calls an \u201caesthetic text-event\u201d that unifies the disparate parts of a poem through a generalizing power (bh\u0101vakatva, De 1960 and Pollock 2016). The audience has the ability to enjoy (Pollock: \u201cexperientialize\u201d) the result through a particular aesthetic capability (bhojakatva), and the result is a transcendent, rapturous experience of rasa. Though understanding N\u0101yaka\u2019s account is difficult, given some textual problems, Ollett 2020 argues that his idea of \u201cactualizing\u201d multiple parts of a text has a parallel with the process by which we understand a unified sentence meaning from the parts of a sentence. While rasa is not a linguistic meaning the way that a sentence meaning is, on this understanding, it, like sentence meaning, is something unified understood in dependence on multiple constituent parts.\nMahima Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (ca. 1025 CE) does not consider rasa anything more than an emotion which has been stabilized into the object of a particular kind of aesthetic enjoyment. His Analysis of \u201cManifestation\u201d argues that, since the characters in a poem are unreal, the emotions they are experiencing are also unreal, and must be inferred or imputed to them. All of the talk of \u201cmanifesting\u201d rasa is itself a figure of speech, on Mahima Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2019s view. In addition, he argues that any putative \u201csecondary meaning\u201d such as indication (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101) is also inferred. Primary meaning plays an evidentiary role in inference based on rules of pervasion (vy\u0101pti) between the primary meaning and secondary or suggested meaning. This position is criticized by later thinkers, since the relationship between primary meaning and these other meanings does not easily admit of universalizable regularities, and suggested meanings are often defeasible (see the entry on logic in classical Indian philosophy for discussion of inference).\nLike Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da N\u0101yaka and Mahima Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da agrees with \u0100nandavardhana that there are poetic phenomena that require explanation. He argues that these meanings arise from the existing category of secondary meaning, indication (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101), rather than the third linguistic capacity of suggested meaning. His Fundamentals of the Communicative Function, through analysis of many of the stock examples of suggestion in the Light on Suggestion, identifies the necessary features which trigger indication: an obstacle in the primary meaning, a relationship between the primary and indicated meaning, and a motive or conventional basis for the indicated meaning. Mukula argues that it is possible to have cases of indicated meaning which do not completely replace the primary meaning. Mukula\u2019s work comes to be widely influential through its incorporation into the Illumination of Poetry (K\u0101vyaprak\u0101\u015ba) written by later philosopher of aesthetics Mamma\u1e6da, who excerpts parts of it verbatim (McCrea 2008).\nRather than explain suggested meaning as part of secondary meaning, the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara school of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 prefers to incorporate it into primary meaning. Their position, which is discussed in more detail below, criticizes the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da distinction between primary and secondary meaning. On their view, word meanings do not\u2014as per the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 view\u2014have a fixed primary meaning regardless of sentence context. Instead, the meaning of a word will vary depending on its relationship with other words in a given sentence. Thus a word can carry a putatively \u201csuggested\u201d meaning simply through force of context. \u0100nandavardhana himself implicitly criticizes this position, arguing that suggested meaning function has a different object, since it does not result directly from the word, but from the primary meaning of the word. For instance, the well-known case of \u201cA village is on the Ganges\u201d suggests the purity of the village\u2014but this cannot be the primary meaning of the word \u201cGanges\u201d even contextually. It is an additional meaning, conveyed subsequent to the ordinary meaning of \u201cGanges\u201d (DL).\n",
