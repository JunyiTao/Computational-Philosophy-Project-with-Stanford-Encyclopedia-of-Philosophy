    "main_text": "Political Theory || Representation\n2.7 Representation\n\nIn his Letter Addressed to the Addressers (1792), and more\nfully in Dissertation on First Principles of Government 1795)\nPaine commits to the conclusion that equal rights entail an equal\nright to have a say in one\u2019s representative. He provides two\nmain arguments. In the Letter\u2026 he argues that as every\nman over the age of twenty-one pays taxes in one form of another, so\neveryone has a right to vote\u2014or a form of entitlement through\ncontribution. But in the Dissertation he makes the case\nwholly on the basis of equal natural rights: \u2018the right of\nvoting for representatives is the primary right by which other rights\nare protected. To take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery,\nfor slavery consists in being subject to the will of another, and he\nthat has not a vote in the election of representatives is in this\ncase. (II, 579) \u2018It is possible to exclude men from the right of\nvoting, but it impossible to exclude them from the right of rebelling\nagainst that exclusion; and when other rights are taken away, the\nright of rebellion is made perfect.\u2019 (II, 580) This suggests\nthat the role of rights grows in importance for Paine, making little\nappearance at all before 1788, and then coming to play an expanding\nrole in his account, to provide the underpinning for political\nauthority and an account of its limits, to justify the right to vote,\nand to make the case for a right to land and the fruits of nature\nwhich is translated into an inheritance right and a range of welfare\nrights. In his account of the origin of rights in Rights of\nMan (1791), he suggests that those (like Burke) who appeal to the\nauthority of antiquity simply do not go back far enough:\n\nIf antiquity is to be an authority, a thousand such authorities may be\nproduced, successively contradicting each other; but if we proceed on,\nwe shall at last come out right; we shall come to the time when man\ncame from the hand of his Maker\u2026we have now arrived at the\norigin of man, and at the origin of his rights\u2026It is authority\nagainst authority all the way, until we come to the divine origin of\nthe rights of man, at the Creation. Here or inquiries find a\nresting-place, and out reason finds a home. (I, 273)\n\n",
