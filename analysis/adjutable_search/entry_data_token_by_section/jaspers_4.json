    "main_text": "Philosophy and Religion\n5. Philosophy and Religion\n\nThe influences of Weber, Kant, Hegel and Kierkegaard are not difficult\nto discern in Jaspers\u2019s work. Similarly, it is also not\ndifficult to identify the ways in which his work was influenced by\nNietzsche. Jaspers borrowed from Nietzsche a psychologistic approach\nto philosophical perspectives, and, like Nietzsche, he tended to view\nphilosophical claims, not as formally verifiable postulates, but as\nexpressions of underlying mental dispositions. For this reason, he\nalso borrowed from Nietzsche a dismissive approach to absolutized\nclaims to truthful knowledge, and a resultant rejection of all\nrational purism. Most especially, however, like Heidegger, he took\nfrom Nietzsche a critical approach to the residues of metaphysics in\nEuropean philosophy, and he denied the existence of essences which are\nexternal or indifferent to human experience. At the same time,\nhowever, Jaspers also clearly positioned his philosophy against many\nelements of the Nietzschean legacy. He was clearly opposed to the\nnaturalistic vitalism evolving from Nietzsche\u2019s work, and his\nemphasis on human subjectivity as a locus of truthful transcendence\nmeant that Kierkegaard, rather than Nietzsche, was the existential\nprototype for his work.\n\nOne further important formative influence on Jaspers\u2019s\nphilosophy, however, was Schelling. Although he was at times critical\nof the simple mysticism and the metaphysics of natural process in\nSchelling\u2019s religious works, his metaphysical reconstruction of\nKantian idealism rearticulated some elements of the positive\nphilosophy of the later Schelling, and it mirrored his attempt to\naccount for truthful knowledge as a cognitive experience in which\nreason is transfigured by its encounter with contents other than its\nown form. In this respect, Jaspers adopted from Schelling a\nnon-identitarian model of cognitive life, which views true (or\ntruthful) knowledge as obtained through acts of positive\ninterpretation and revelation at the limits of rational consciousness.\nUnlike Schelling, he always rejected claims to absolute positive\nknowledge; to this extent, he remained\u2014in the ultimate\nanalysis\u2014a Kantian philosopher. However, he was clearly\nsympathetic to Schelling\u2019s critique of formal epistemological\nnegativism. Indeed, through his hermeneutical transformation of\nidealism into a metaphysics of symbolic interpretation, he might be\nseen, like both Schelling and Johann Georg Hamann before him, as a\nphilosopher who was intent on re-invoking the truth of revelation, as\nan absolute and non-identical content of knowledge, against the\nrational evidences of epistemology, and so on elaborating an\ninterpretive methodology adapted to a conception of truth as disclosed\nor revealed.\n\nThe discrete but important influence of Schelling on Jaspers\u2019s\nphilosophy also provides a clue to understanding Jaspers\u2019s\nphilosophy of religion. At one level, Jaspers was philosophically\ncommitted to a sympathetic retrieval of religious contents. He was\ninsistent that truth can only be interpreted as an element of radical\nalterity in reason, or as reason\u2019s experience of its own limits.\nSimilarly, he was insistent that the conditions of human freedom are\nnot generated by human reason alone, but are experienced as incursions\nof transcendence in rational thought. For these reasons, his\nphilosophy is sympathetic towards the primary implications of\nrevelation theology, and it cautiously upholds the essential\nphilosophical claim of revelation: namely, that truth is a disclosure\nof otherness (transcendence) to reason, or at least an interpreted\nmoment of otherness in reason. At the same time, however, Jaspers\ncannot in any obvious way be described as a religious philosopher. In\nfact, he was very critical of revelation theology, and of orthodox\nreligions more generally, on a number of quite separate counts. First,\nhe argued that the centre of religion is always formed by a falsely\nobjectivized or absolutized claim to truth, which fails to recognize\nthat transcendence occurs in many ways, and that transcendent truths\ncannot be made concrete as a set of factual statements or narratives.\nReligious world views are therefore examples of limited mental\nattitudes, which seek a hold in uniform doctrine in order to evade a\nconfrontation with the uncertainty and instability of transcendence.\nIn positing transcendence as a realized element of revelation,\nreligion in fact obstructs the capacity for transcendence which all\npeople possess; religion claims to offer transcendence, but it\nactually obstructs it. Second, then, as the foundations of dogma and\ndoctrinal orthodoxy, revealed truth-claims eliminate the self-critical\nand communicative aspect of human reason, and they undermine the\ndialogical preconditions of transcendence and existential\nself-knowledge. Jaspers thus viewed orthodox religion as an\nobstruction to communication, which places dogmatic limits on the\ncommon human capacity for truthfulness and transcendence. Nonetheless,\nas a philosopher of transcendence, he was also clear that human\ntruthfulness, or humanity more generally, cannot be conceived without\na recuperation of religious interpretive approaches and without a\nrecognition of the fact that the founding contents of philosophy are\ntranscendent. Much of his work, in consequence, might be construed as\nan attempt to free the contents of religious thinking from the\ndogmatic orthodoxies imposed upon these contents in the name of\norganized religion.\n\nThe central idea in Jaspers\u2019s philosophy of religion is the\nconcept of philosophical faith, set out most extensively in\nDer Philosophische Glaube (Philosophical Faith,\n1948) and Der Philophische Glaube angesichts der christlichen\nOffenbarung (Philosophical Faith in face of Christian\nRevelation, 1962). This notoriously difficult concept contains a\nnumber of quite distinct meanings. First, it means that true\nphilosophy must be guided by a faith in the originary transcendence of\nhuman existence, and that philosophy which negatively excludes or\nignores its transcendent origin falls short of the highest tasks of\nphilosophy. Second, however, it also means that true philosophy cannot\nsimply abandon philosophical rationality for positively disclosed\ntruth-contents or dogma, and that the critical function of rationality\nhas a constitutive role in the formation of absolute knowledge. In\nthis respect, Jaspers revisited some of the controversies concerning\nthe relation between religion and philosophy which shaped the\nphilosophy of the Young Hegelians in the 1830s. Like the Young\nHegelians, he insisted that faith needs philosophy, and faith devalues\nits contents wherever these are dogmatically or positively proclaimed.\nThird, then, this concept also indicates that the evidences of faith\nare always paradoxical and uncertain and that those who pursue\nknowledge of these contents must accept an attitude of philosophical\nrelativism and discursive exchange: if faith results in dogmatism, it\nimmediately undermines its claims to offer transcendent knowledge. The\nconcept of philosophical faith is thus proposed, not as a doctrine of\nfactual revelation or accomplished transcendence, but as a guide to\ntranscendent communication, which balances the element of disclosure\nin faith with a critical philosophical veto on the absolutism of\nreligious claims, and which consequently insists that transcendent\nknowledge must be accepted as relative and incomplete. In this regard,\nJaspers held the religious aspects of his philosophy on a fine\ndialectic between theological and anthropological assertions. He\nimplied, at one level, that purely secularist accounts of human life\nocclude existence against its originary transcendent possibilities and\nfreedoms. At the same time, however, he also suggested that pure\ntheological analysis closes humanity against the relativity and\nprecariousness of its truths, and against the communicative processes\nthrough which these truths are disclosed. Only philosophy which can at\nonce embrace and relativize secularism and embrace and relativize\nreligion is able to undertake adequate existential inquiry, and\nphilosophy which, in either direction, abandons the dialectical edge\nbetween these two commitments ceases to be genuine philosophy.\n\nThis critical-recuperative attitude towards religious inquiry was\nfundamental to many of the public controversies in which Jaspers\nengaged. The religious elements of his work came under attack from the\nCalvinist theologian, Karl Barth, who denounced the lack of objective\nreligious content in his concept of transcendence. More significantly,\nthough, Jaspers also entered into a lengthy and influential\ncontroversy with Rudolf Bultmann, the resonances of which still impact\non liberal theological debate. At the centre of this debate was\nJaspers\u2019s critique of Bultmann\u2019s strategy of scriptural\nde-mythologization: that is, his attempt to clarify the\ntruth-contents of the scriptures by eliminating the historical or\nmythological elements of the New Testament, and by concentrating, in\nan existentially intonated exegesis, on the perennially valid and\npresent aspects of the Bible. At the time when Bultmann first proposed\nthis de-mythologizing approach Jaspers was widely (although\nerroneously) identified with the liberal wing of Protestant theology,\nand it was perhaps expected that he might declare sympathy for\nBultmann\u2019s hermeneutical approach. Jaspers, however, turned\nsharply on Bultmann. He accused him, first, of propagating a false\nrationalism in religious debate; second, of arbitrarily dismissing the\nmanifestations, embedded in myth, of the spiritual experiences of\nthose living in earlier historical \u00e9poques; and, third, of\naligning all transcendent experiences to a standard scheme of relative\nvalue, and so of imposing a new system of orthodoxy in theology and\nundermining the manifold possibilities of transcendence. In opposition\nto Bultmann, therefore, Jaspers concluded that only a religious\nhermeneutic based in absolute liberality, excluding all\northodoxy, could be appropriate to the task of interpreting the\ntranscendent contents of human life. Interpretive methods which efface\nthe traces of historical contingency from transcendence and reduce\ntranscendence to one predetermined religious truth, he suggested, fail\nto reflect on the plural and various forms in which transcendence can\nbe interpreted, they erroneously presuppose that transcendence can be\nencased in the categories of one exclusive doctrine, and they\nundervalue the constitutive historical variability of transcendence.\nAs a consequence, Jaspers argued implicitly for the importance of\nmythical or symbolic forms in religious inquiry, and he indicated that\nboth myth and religion contain, in similar measure, the interpreted\nresidues of transcendence. His analysis of religion culminated in a\ndiscussion of Trinitarian theology which, echoing Ludwig\nFeuerbach\u2019s anthropological analysis, asserted that the three\nparts of the trinity should be interpreted, not as factual elements of\ndeity, but as symbolic ciphers of human possibility. In this, he\nascribed particular significance to the second person of the Trinity,\nJesus Christ, as a cipher for the human existential possibility of\ninner change, reversal and transformation. Wherever this cipher is\nhypostatically defined as mere positive fact of belief, he concluded\nhowever, the freedom of transcendence obtained through the sympathetic\ninterpretation and recuperation of this cipher is obstructed.\n\nUnderlying Jaspers\u2019s interest in religion was a determination to\nconvert the elements of religious doctrine into an account of human\npossibilities and freedoms. Indeed, the ambition behind his work on\nreligion and myth was no less than to liberate transcendence from\ntheology, and to permit an interpretive transformation of religiously\nconceived essences into the free moments of human self-interpretation.\nIf his thought can truly be placed in the terrain of theological\ndiscourse, therefore, his approach to religion is one of extreme\nliberalism and latitudinarianism, which dismisses the claim that\ntranscendence is exclusively or even predominantly disclosed by\nreligion. The truth of religion, he intimated, only becomes true if it\nis interpreted as a human truth, not as a truth originally external or\nprior to humanity. In its orthodox form, however, religion normally\nprevents the knowledge of transcendence which it purports to\noffer.\n",
