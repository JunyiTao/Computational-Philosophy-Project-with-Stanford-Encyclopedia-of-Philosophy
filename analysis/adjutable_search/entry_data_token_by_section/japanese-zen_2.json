The Practice: Three-Step Process\n\nWhen one engages in Zen meditation, Zen recommends that its\npractitioner follow a three-step procedure: adjusting one\u2019s body,\nbreathing and mind. The practitioner follows these adjustments in the\norder mentioned when he or she begins. When concluding a sitting\nsession, the procedure is reversed so that he or she can return to an\neveryday standpoint. We now briefly explain these three steps in\nthe order mentioned.\n",
