    "main_text": "Levels in biological theory and usage || The evolution of complexity\n6.4 The evolution of complexity\n\nLevels of organization are also invariably tied to discussions of\ncomplexity in biology. One of the most prominent appearances of levels\nin the investigation of complexity occurs in observations of the\napparent increase in structural hierarchies in organisms over\nevolutionary time. This increase of \u201cnestedness\u201d, where\nparts become located within other systems, appears to be a clear trend\nin the history of life (McShea 1996; 2001). Daniel McShea (2001)\npoints to three examples of this trend, including the origin of\neukaryotic cells from prokaryotes via endosymbiosis, the emergence of\nmulticellular organisms, and the appearance of colonies formed by\nmulticellular individuals. Yet it is not clear what precise\nrelationship exists between levels of organization and complexity, and\nthe explication of complexity remains an important task in its own\nright. On this point, though there exists no consensus among\nbiologists, the two clearly inform each other.\n\nBeginning with complexity, several measures for complexity have been\nproposed, many of which are intimately tied with the idea of levels.\nFor instance, John Tyler Bonner (1988: 220) draws attention to the\nrelations of size and complexity, identifying a trend in the upper\nlimit of body size and an increase in complexity. This overall trend\naccompanies both actual increases as well as decreases in body sizes\nover evolutionary time. Bonner entertains two measures of complexity,\nincluding (1) the correlation of body size and number of cell types,\nand (2) the relation between genome size and number of cell types.\nAlthough he (and later researchers) concluded that there is no clear\npattern indicating that the increase in the number of genes in a\ngenome is accompanied by an increase in cell types, the former\ncorrelation appears to recover robust inference patterns, and has\nbecome a mainstay of informing uses of complexity (Valentine, Collins,\n& Meyer 1994; Valentine 2002; McShea 2021). Another proposed\nmeasure of complexity, offered by Hinegardner, and Engleberg (1983),\ncharacterizes the notion in terms of the minimal description necessary\nto capture the system\u2019s behavior. These two approaches are\nrelated (Valentine, Collins, & Meyer 1994), though have not been\nsystematically integrated. Finally, McShea (2021) summarizes and\ncontrasts \u201chorizontal\u201d complexity, understood\napproximately as the number of cell types, and \u201cvertical\u201d\ncomplexity, which refers to the number of hierarchical partitionings\n(understood as nestedness) that are found within a system.\n\nThese characterizations of complexity and their relations to levels,\nlike many discussions concerning the latter, leave much room for\ncontinued discussion and further scholarship. For one thing, though it\nappears clear that complexity and levels remain intimately related,\nthe authors summarized above are not without discrepancies regarding\nthe importance, or even place, of levels of organization in talking\nabout complexity. For example, Bonner (1988) sets out his\ninvestigation by noting that it is not levels per se that is\nof interest but rather how levels themselves come into existence.\nRelatedly, McShea (2001) notes that levels of organization are a\n\u201csecondary theme\u201d (ibid., 406) to notions of nested\nhierarchies in biology and measuring complexity.\n",
