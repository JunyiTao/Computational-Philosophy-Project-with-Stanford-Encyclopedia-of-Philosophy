Its principal contribution\nis in offering a concise recapitulation of the currents of Madhyamaka\nthought and of Madhyamaka arguments against Yog\u0101c\u0101ra monism,\nwhich portrays consciousness as the ultimate source of all realities.\nWhile that is generally the case, one candidate for novelty occurs in\nearlier chapters of Bodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra, where\n\u015a\u0101ntideva provides a line of argument that became standard\nin discussion of Mah\u0101y\u0101na ethics. His claim is that pain and\nunhappiness are by definition that which those who experience them\nwish to avoid. But given that there are no inherent natures that\ndistinguish one person from another, or one kind of person from\nanother kind, there is no rational basis to prefer one\u2019s own\nexperiences and judgments to those of anyone else or to prefer what\none perceives as one\u2019s own kind from other kinds of people. It\nis fundamentally irrational to take an interest only in one\u2019s\nown pain and suffering; the only reasonable approach is to be\nconcerned with all the pain and unhappiness of which one\nbecomes aware and to try to eradicate all of it without making\nartificial distinctions. Since, however, most of what anyone finds\npainful and unpleasant arises from the conviction that some objects of\nexperience are inherently undesirable or impure, the best strategy to\nfollow in helping oneself and others overcome pain and suffering is to\nshow that there is no basis for the belief that some objects are\ninherently undesirable or impure. That strategy also works, of course,\nwhen unhappiness arises from the frustration of not getting things\nthat one falsely believes are inherently desirable and pure.\n\nAs was the case with Candrak\u012brti\u2019s\nMadhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra, \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s\nBodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra has the most to say about\nMadhyamaka philosophy in the chapter on the perfection of wisdom. A\nkey verse in this chapter is 9.35, which says \u201cWhen neither\npresence nor absence stands before the mind, the mind, having no\ncontent, calms down because of the absence of cognition.\u201d This\nrecapitulates a point made by both N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and\nCandrak\u012brti that the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice is\nnirvana, a stillness of the mind in which there is no object being\ngrasped as the focus of awareness, no narratives\n(prapa\u00f1ca) being told to account for one\u2019s\nexperience, no theorizing and no argumentation. At the outset of the\nchapter on wisdom \u015a\u0101ntideva says that the ultimate truth is\nof a reality that is not within range of the intellect; the intellect\noperates only at the level of conventional truth. In this world there\nare two kinds of human being, which \u015a\u0101ntideva calls ordinary\npeople (pr\u0101k\u1e5bta loka) and meditators\n(yogin). The ordinary people are those who see the world in\nterms of presences and absences, being and non-being, but the\nconventional truths in which they trade are set aside by the truths of\nthe meditators. The principal delusion of those who rely on\nconventional truths is that they mistakenly believe that propositions\nconventionally accepted as truth are grounded in the natures of\nthings. Meditators, on the other hand, come to realize that things do\nnot have inherent natures. That things do not have inherent natures\ncannot be established directly, but attempts to show that things do\nhave inherent natures can be shown to be faulty. One who has\ncultivated the intention to become enlightened in order to lead others\nout of their delusion-driven suffering uses language to help people\nrealize the limitations of language and conceptual thinking. In taking\nthis approach, \u015a\u0101ntideva is clearly following the lead of\nBuddhap\u0101lita and Candrak\u012brti.\n",
