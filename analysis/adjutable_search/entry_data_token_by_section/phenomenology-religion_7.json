    "main_text": "Doctrine and mundane experience\n4. Two contrasting emphases in the study of religion\n\nWe have been examining some of the ways in which the phenomenology of\nhuman experience may be relevant to the content of religious belief\n(e.g., to a religiously resonant understanding of divine presence) and\nto its epistemic standing (e.g., to the intentionality of religious\nexperience). When such considerations are squeezed out of an account\nof the religious or spiritual life, that is likely to be because of a\npreference for doctrine or practice as the central category in terms\nof which religion is to be understood. So we can think of two\ncorrelative challenges for any approach that makes some appeal to\nphenomenology: perhaps such an account fails to reckon with the\ndoctrinal content of religious belief, and perhaps it overlooks the\nrole of practice in defining religious traditions.\n\nThe first objection makes most sense if we are working with a\nrelatively simple distinction between doctrines (creedal items derived\nfrom, say, the Bible or later theological reflection) and experience.\nBut as we have seen, doctrine and experience are likely to be mutually\ninforming, and it is reasonable to suppose that in some cases\nreligious understanding involves a kind of amalgam of doctrinal scheme\nand body of experience, where these elements cannot in any simple way\nbe separated out.\n\nNewman makes a related point when he distinguishes a\n\u201cnotion\u201d from a \u201creal image\u201d of God (1979, p.\n108). A notion of God is an abstract conception of God, while a real\nimage of God, he tends to think, presupposes the notion, but deepens\nit by way of affectively toned, first hand experience of God. So for\nexample, to have encountered God in the call of conscience, in the\nexperience of remorse, is thereby to have a new understanding of the\nsense in which God is properly called judge, although the additional\nincrement of understanding may not be readily verbalisable. (Compare\nGoldie on our knowledge of the dangerousness of ice.)\n\nOther commentators have thought that phenomenological treatments of\nreligion risk overlooking the central role of practices in\nconstituting religious traditions. For example, in his study\nBeyond Phenomenology, Gavin Flood remarks that: \u201cIt is\nritual structures and performed narratives which have primacy in the\ntransmission of traditions through the generations and not any\nindividual experience or state of consciousness\u201d (1999, p. 107).\nAgain, as with doctrine, so here we might wish to avoid any overly\nsharp disjunction of phenomenology and practice.\n\nThis point can be made particularly succinctly by considering again\nthe case of emotional feelings. Such feelings involve patterns of\nsalient viewing, we have seen; but they can also be connected to the\nposture of the body. For example, in standard cases, to feel fear is\nin part to register the tensing of the body, and in turn therefore its\ntaking stock of a particular environment, and its making ready to act\nin that environment (Solomon 2003 and Pickard 2003). So the\nintellectual content of an emotional feeling, concerning what is\ndeserving of attention in a given context of choice, is we might\nsuppose realised both in a correlative structuring of the perceptual\nfield, and in a kinaesthetic appreciation of the body\u2019s\nreadiness to act in that context.\n\nDepending on the details of the case, we might want to see the\nexpressive posture of the body as coming first, and giving rise to a\ncertain ordering of the perceptual field, or vice versa. But, here, we\nseem to have two ways of grasping a certain content; and these two\nways seem to be held together by the relevant emotional feeling, since\nsuch feelings are realised both in a certain pattern of salient\nviewing and in the feeling of a correlative posture of the body.\n\nSo here \u201cpractice,\u201d or the readiness of the body to act in\ncertain ways in the world, is not straightforwardly separable from\n\u201cdoctrine\u201d (a conceptually organised appreciation of the\nworld) or emotional feeling. Instead these three make up a unitary\nstate of mind. And similarly, we might suppose, certain religious\npractices are reciprocally implicated in correlative ways of seeing,\nand in turn in correlative doctrines, in ways that resist any easy\ndisaggregation or prioritisation. Max Scheler makes something like\nthis point when he suggests that different postures of the body in\nprayer reciprocally define different conceptions of God (1960, p.\n266); and, once again, we might suppose that similar connections are\ndisplayed in the responses of the body on the approach to a sacred\nsite.\n\nTaking another route into these questions, we might think that\nprogress in the spiritual life can be described in terms of different\nvocabularies: sometimes, a religious tradition may use a relatively\nexperiential or phenomenological idiom to mark the distinction between\ndifferent phases of the spiritual life; sometimes, it may use a\nbehavioural idiom, by citing, for instance, the enacted example of the\nsaints; and sometimes it may use a more metaphysical idiom, by noting,\nsay, how the relationship between divine and human agency may take\ndifferent forms at different stages of the spiritual life.\nAccordingly, to take just one example, we might suppose that the\nchange that concerns Thomas Aquinas when he speaks of how the infused\nmoral virtues extend the acquired moral virtues must in some way\ncorrelate with the change that John of the Cross records when he\nspeaks of the descent into the \u201cdark night,\u201d and of the\ntransition from there into a renewed appreciation of the everyday\nsensory world. In this way, we can see phenomenological\ncharacterisations of the religious or spiritual life as integrally\nconnected to characterisations that make use of a more behavioural or\nmetaphysical vocabulary (Wynn 2017).\n\nIn sum, then, rather than giving precedence to doctrine- or\npractice-based accounts of religion, we might suppose that these\naccounts will themselves come fully into focus only when they are\ncombined with an appreciation of the phenomenology of religion.\n",
