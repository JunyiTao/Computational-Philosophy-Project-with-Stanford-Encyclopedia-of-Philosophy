    "main_text": "Main Themes || Same and Different\n2.1 Same and Different\n\nAs we saw above, \u201csame\u201d (tong) and\n\u201cdifferent\u201d (yi) are central concepts in ancient\nChinese theories of language, knowledge, and disputation, as\nrepresented by the Mohists and Xunzi. According to the Mohists,\n\u201csameness\u201d can refer to at least four types of relations:\nidentity; part-whole relations; being grouped together or co-located;\nand having some intrinsic similarity and thus being part of the same\n\u201ckind\u201d. This last variety of \u201csameness\u201d is\nprobably most important for our purposes here. Names names for\n\u201ckinds\u201d (lei)\u2014one type of general\nterm\u2014 are regarded as denoting all things or stuff\n(shi) that is \u201cthe same\u201d in one or more respects,\nsuch as all horses, which share the same shape (xing) and appearance\n(mao). Speakers can use language to communicate because they are\nfamiliar with the kinds of similar things that words refer to, and\nthus upon hearing a word know what the thing referred to \u201cis\nlike.\u201d The relations of \u201csame\u201d and\n\u201cdifferent\u201d determine what counts as correct matching of\nnames and stuff and thus what knowledge is. Disputation is\nfundamentally a process of debating whether the thing in question is\n\u201cthis\u201d (shi) or \u201cnot-this\u201d\n(fei), the same as or different from some model, paradigm, or\nanalogy. The issue of how to distinguish \u201csame\u201d from\n\u201cdifferent\u201d is thus pivotal to Chinese philosophy of\nlanguage, epistemology, and disputation. \n\nSome references to the disputers\u2019 interest in \u201cthe same\nand different,\u201d then, may allude to legitimate, if widely\nmisunderstood, inquiries into the foundations of language and\nknowledge. Gongsun Long\u2019s \u201cuniting the same and\ndifferent,\u201d on the other hand, probably refers to manipulating\nstandards for distinguishing different kinds in order to produce\nsophisms. The disputer could cite features of different kinds of\nthings by which they could be treated as the same or features of\nthings of the same kind by which they could be treated as different.\n(This strategy is suggested by the fifth thesis of Hui Shi, to be\ndiscussed below.) Such shifting of criteria for distinguishing\nsameness from difference is illustrated by many of the\ndisputers\u2019 sophisms. Among other examples, Hui Shi\u2019s\n\u201cThe sky is as low as earth, mountains are level with\nmarshes\u201d deems different things similar; some of the arguments\nfor Gongsun Long\u2019s \u201cA white horse is not a horse\u201d\ntreat things of the same kind\u2014horses and white horses\u2014as\ndifferent, playing largely on the ambiguity between \u201csame\u201d\nin the sense of being of the same kind and \u201csame\u201d in the\nsense of identity. \n\nManipulating the same and the different alters the distinctions that\nground our use of words and thus our standards of knowledge. (In the\nmost extreme case, uniting everything into a \u201cGreat One\u201d\nwould leave us unable to communicate linguistically and eliminate all\nconceptual or propositional knowledge.) The notion that we can realign\nthe boundaries of the same and different without limit signals a\nradical skepticism about the existence of natural kinds. Indeed, it\nthreatens to leave us without any knowledge at all, since the\nstandards by which to judge whether one knows something are never\nfixed. It also provides an approach to winning any disputation:\ninstead of seeking objective criteria that fix the correct\ndistinctions between things, disputers just redraw the distinctions\nbetween things or kinds in whatever way needed to establish their\nclaim. \n",
