    "main_text": "Biographical sketch\n1. Biographical sketch\n\nOtto Neurath was born on 10 December 1882 in Vienna. He was the son of\nGertrud Kaempffert and Wilhelm Neurath, a Hungarian Jewish political\neconomist and social reformer, and was born Roman Catholic. Initially\nstudying in Vienna philosophy, mathematics and physics and then\nhistory, philosophy and economics (he formally enrolled for classes at\nthe University of Vienna only for two semesters in 1902-3), he\nfollowed the social scientist Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies\u2019s advice to\nmove to Berlin, where he received a doctoral degree in history of\neconomics in 1906. He studied under Eduard Meyer and Gustav Schmoller\nand he was awarded the degree for two studies of economic history of\nantiquity, one on Cicero\u2019s De Officiis and the other\nwith an emphasis on the non-monetary economy of Egypt. In his\nbiographical pr\u00e9cis at the end his doctoral dissertation on\nCicero, he mentioned having studied mathematics, natural science and\nphilosophy in Vienna with von Escherich, Haberda, Haffner, Hartl,\nJodl, Kohn, Kretschmer, von Lang, Lieben, Mertens, M\u00fcch,\nM\u00fcllner, Oberhummer, Penck, Schindler and von Schroeder, and that\nin Berlin, he studied national economy, history and philosophy with\nvon Bortkiewicz, Breysig, Brunner, Eberstadt, Hintze, Jastrow, Landau,\nMenzer, Meyer, Paulsen, Schmoller, Simmel, and Wagner. He also\nacknowledged that he had studied the ideas of the logician Gregor\nItelson, Wilhelm Neurath\u2019s colleague and mathematician Oskar\nSimony, and the social scientist Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies.\n\nHis first publications were in logic, a subject he had formally\nlearned at the University of Vienna from Laurenz M\u00fcllner and\npossibly Friedrich Jodl, and in the history of political economy, on\nwhich his father had also written. The papers on logic (see below)\nexamined different kinds of identities and the principle of duality\nstimulated by Schr\u00f6der; they included one paper co-authored with\nhis friend and second wife, Olga Hahn, sister of the mathematician\nHans Hahn. In the history of political economy, topics included the\nhistory of money and economic organizations in antiquity, and his\npublications included textbooks and readers either co-authored or\nco-edited with his first wife Anna Schapire-Neurath. Not surprisingly,\nhis subsequent theorizing on the social sciences and his contributions\nto debates in logical empiricism integrated both disciplines. With the\nmathematician Hans Hahn and the physicist Philip Frank, around 1910\nNeurath formed in Vienna a philosophical discussion group devoted to\nthe philosophical ideas about science of Vienna\u2019s\nphenomenologist Ernst Mach and the French conventionalists Pierre\nDuhem, Abel Rey and Henri Poincar\u00e9. A great deal of\nphilosophical and scientific concerns and insight were already in\nplace in Neurath\u2019s thinking and projects. With a grant from the\nCarnegie Endowment for International Peace, a subsequent study of the\nBalkan wars before World War I led to his theory of war economy as a\nnatural (non-monetary) economy, or economy in kind.\n\nIn 1919 the short-lived Bavarian socialist government (November\n1918-April 1919) appointed him head of the Central Planning Office.\nThe fall of the subsequent Bavarian Soviet Republic in May 1919 got\nhim expelled from his junior post teaching economic theory at\nHeidelberg University, where he had received his Habilitation\nin 1917. His program for full socialization was inspired by his\nstudies of war economics and based on his theory of natural economy\nand a holistic requirement to bring different institutions and kinds\nof knowledge together in order to understand, predict and control the\ncomplex phenomena of the social world. From 1921 until 1934 Neurath\nparticipated actively in the development of Vienna\u2019s socialist\npolitics, especially in housing and adult education (on his political\nlife, see Sandner 2014). He established the Social and Economic Museum\nof Vienna, where he developed and applied the \u2018Vienna\nmethod\u2019 of picture statistics and the ISOTYPE language\n(International System of Typographic Picture Education) (see the\nsupplementary document on\n Visual Education).\n Like the thought of other Viennese philosophers such as Wittgenstein\nand Popper, Neurath\u2019s philosophy was inextricably linked to\npedagogical theory, critique of language and, in Popper\u2019s case,\npolitical thought. In 1928, with members of the Austrian Freethinkers\nAssociation and the Vienna City Council and the scientifically-trained\nmembers of the informal circle around the current holder of\nMach\u2019s University Chair, the philosopher Moritz Schlick\n(1924-29), Neurath helped found the Verein Ernst Mach, the\nErnst Mach Association for the Promotion of Science Education. The\npublication in 1929 of an intellectual manifesto gave way to the\nformation of the Vienna Circle, whose narrower goal was the\narticulation and promotion of a scientific world-conception and\nlogical empiricism (on the Viennese intellectual landscape, see\nStadler 2001).\n\nSubsequently, when in 1934 the Austrian government allied itself with\nthe Nazi government in Germany, Neurath fled to the Netherlands. As a\nresult, his local, Viennese, socialist Enlightenment project turned\ninto an internationalist, intellectual and social-political project.\nHe created the International Foundation for Visual Education in The\nHague, with his assistants from Vienna, and spearheaded the\nInternational Unity of Science movement. The latter, inspired by a\ntradition culminating in the Enlightenment\u2019s French\nEncyclopedists, launched the project of an Encyclopedia of Unified\nScience. Together with the pictorial languages, the scientific\nencyclopedia would promote scientific and social cooperation and\nprogress at an international level. After Austria became part of the\nGerman Reich in 1938, even though living in the Netherlands, Neurath\nwas considered a German citizen and a \u2018half-Jew\u2019 and he\nwas not allowed to marry his \u2018Aryan\u2019 assistant Marie\nReidemeister\u2014after his second wife, Olga, had died in 1937.\nDuring this period, he travelled abroad, including the United States,\nwhere logical empiricism had become entangled with the Cold War\npolitical and intellectual debates and witch hunts (on the Cold War\nphase, see Reich 2005). Carnap and Charles Morris at the University of\nChicago acted as his co-editors of the International Encyclopedia of\nUnified Science. New York leftist intellectuals hosted him as an\nintellectual and political ally. And his maternal first cousin\nWaldemar Kaempffert, influential editor for The New York\nTimes and Popular Science, introduced him as an\ninternational reformer and visionary, praising his science-oriented\nintellectual, social and educational ideas, especially his\ncontribution to unity of science and visual language (see Reisch\n2019). After the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands in 1940, Otto\nNeurath and Marie Reidemeister fled to England, on the small\nSeaman\u2019s Hope. After nine months in an internment camp\nthey resumed activities related to the Isotype language and the unity\nof science. He died in Oxford on 22 December 1945 (on activities in\nthe camp see Henning 2019; on activities after see K\u00f6rber 2019\nand Tuboly 2019).\n",
