    "main_text": "\n1. Molyneux\u2019s Formulation of the Problem\n\nAs is apparent from both his writings and his lectures, Molyneux was\nhighly interested in optics and in the psychology of sight. To some\nextent this simply reflects the general attitude of his time: optics\nwas a subject that was then engaging the attention of a number of\nleading scientists. His interest also had a more personal background,\nhowever, for his wife had lost her sight in the first year of their\nmarriage. The immediate cause of his formulating the problem and\nsending it to Locke is to be found in Locke\u2019s French extract of\nAn Essay Concerning Humane Understanding, published in 1688\nin the Biblioth\u00e8que Universelle & Historique. In\nthis extract Locke distinguished between ideas we acquire by means of\none sense and those we acquire by means of more than one sense. He\nmaintained that someone who lacks a sense will never be able to\nacquire the ideas pertaining to it. A blind man, for example, will\nnever be able to have any idea of colour. Among the ideas we are able\nto acquire by means of a combination of senses, Locke reckoned those\nof space, rest, motion and figure. Molyneux\u2019s problem had to do\nwith the last of these. Molyneux was probably inspired by\nLocke\u2019s exposition of the ideas of persons born blind and the\nideas which can be acquired by means of both sight and touch. He was,\nmoreover, a great admirer of Locke. (Although earlier we suggested\nthat Molyneux might have been inspired by Ibn Tufail\u2019s\ntwelfth-century philosophical novel Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, which\nhad just been published in Latin (1671) and English (1674) and also\nhad an influence on Locke, there seems to be no indication that\nMolyneux read Ibn\n Tufail.)[1]\n\nOn Saturday 7 July 1688 William Molyneux wrote a letter to John Locke\nsetting out for the first time his problem concerning the person born\nblind:\n\n\nDublin July. 7. 88\n\nA Problem Proposed to the Author of the Essai Philosophique\nconcernant L\u2019Entendement \n\nA Man, being born blind, and having a Globe and a Cube, nigh of the\nsame bignes, Committed into his Hands, and being taught or Told, which\nis Called the Globe, and which the Cube, so as easily to distinguish\nthem by his Touch or Feeling; Then both being taken from Him, and Laid\non a Table, Let us Suppose his Sight Restored to Him; Whether he\nCould, by his Sight, and before he touch them, know which is the Globe\nand which the Cube? Or Whether he Could know by his Sight, before he\nstretch\u2019d out his Hand, whether he Could not Reach them, tho\nthey were Removed 20 or 1000 feet from Him?\n\nIf the Learned and Ingenious Author of the Forementiond Treatise think\nthis Problem Worth his Consideration and Answer, He may at any time\nDirect it to One that Much Esteems him, and is,\n\nHis Humble Servant\n\nWilliam Molyneux\n\nHigh Ormonds Gate in Dublin. Ireland\n\n\nFor reasons unknown Locke never replied to the letter. However, a\ncouple of years later, after the two men had started an amicable\ncorrespondence, Molyneux returned to his problem. This time with\nsuccess. In his letter, dated 2 March 1693, Molyneux presented Locke\nwith his problem, though in a somewhat altered form, asking Locke if\nhe could perhaps find some place in his Essay to say\nsomething about it. This time Locke reacted with enthusiasm:\n\u201cYour ingenious problem will deserve to be published to the\nworld.\u201d From the second edition of his Essay (that of\n1694) Locke included Molyneux\u2019s problem in his work and thereby\nmade it accessible to a wider audience:\n\nSuppose a Man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to\ndistinguish between a Cube, and a Sphere of the same metal, and nighly\nof the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and\nt\u2019other; which is the Cube, which the Sphere. Suppose then the\nCube and Sphere placed on a Table, and the Blind Man to be made to\nsee. Quaere, Whether by his sight, before he touch\u2019d them, he\ncould now distinguish, and tell, which is the Globe, which the Cube.\n\n\nIn this formulation Molyneux\u2019s problem attracted the attention\nof lots of philosophers and other men of learning, such as Berkeley,\nLeibniz, Voltaire, Diderot, La Mettrie, Helmholtz and William\nJames. In which ways did they approach the problem?\n2. Eighteenth-Century Philosophical Discussions about Molyneux\u2019s Problem\n\nIn the first instance, philosophers considered it to be impossible\nthat a man born blind should be able to acquire sight. They regarded\nMolyneux\u2019s problem as a kind of thought-experiment, which was to\nbe dealt with by ratiocination alone. The arguments put forward were\nusually concerned with the relation between visual and tactual\nsensations or between visual and tactual notions of the form of\nobjects.\n\nAll these philosophers assumed that the visual and tactual sensations\nof an object differ from each other, but there was no agreement\nconcerning the relation between the two. Some, Berkeley for instance,\nbelieved that this relation is arbitrary and based only on experience.\nOthers, such as Lee and Synge, thought that it is necessary and\nperceived directly, while yet others, such as Molyneux and Locke,\nthought that it is necessary and learned by experience. Opinions were\nalso divided concerning the relation between visual and tactual\nnotions of objects. Some philosophers defended the position that the\nvisual and tactual notions of a globe differ from one another, and can\nonly be related by either experience or reason (the latter view was\ndefended by Reid). Others believed that the visual and the tactual\nnotion of a globe are actually the same, or have something in common\nwhich is either observed directly (Boullier and Hutcheson) or inferred\nby reason (Leibniz).\n\nInvestigating how the different positions correlate with the answers\ngiven to Molyneux\u2019s question, one can conclude as follows.\nEmpiricists such as Molyneux, Locke and Berkeley answered in the\nnegative. More rationalist philosophers such as Synge, Lee and Leibniz\ngave an affirmative answer. There was no unanimous solution, amongst\nothers because Molyneux\u2019s problem was interpreted in different\nways. Some philosophers thought that the man born blind had to answer\ndirectly, while others were of the opinion that he should be able to\nmake use of his memory and reason, and that he should be at liberty to\nview all sides of the objects by walking around them. Some\nphilosophers believed that the question implied that the man should be\ntold in advance that he would be presented with a globe and cube,\nwhereas others thought that he should not be provided with this\ninformation.\n3. The First Experimental Data\n\nDiscussion concerning Molyneux\u2019s problem took a new turn once\nthe English surgeon and anatomist William Cheselden (1688\u20131752)\npublished an account of what a congenitally blind person had seen\nafter his cataracts had been removed (1728). The publication led\nphilosophers to regard the Molyneux problem no longer as a simple\nthought-experiment, but as a question which could be answered by\nexperimentation.\n\nIn his account, Cheselden noted that when the boy\u2014who recently\nhas been identified as Daniel Dolins\u2014was first able to see, he\ndid not know the shape of a thing and could not recognize one thing\nfrom another, regardless of how different in shape or magnitude they\n were.[2]\n Some philosophers thought that Cheselden\u2019s observations were\nunequivocal and that they confirmed the hypothesis that a blind man\nrestored to sight would not be able to distinguish objects and would\nhave to learn to see. Most of these philosophers, we might mention\nVoltaire, Camper and the elder Condillac as examples, were adherents\nof Berkeley\u2019s theory of vision, which had predicted a similar\noutcome.\n\nOthers, however, such as La Mettrie and Diderot, regarded\nCheselden\u2019s account as wholly ambiguous in its implications.\nThey pointed out that it was possible that the boy had been unable to\nmake valid perceptual judgments because his eyes had not been\nfunctioning properly. They suggested that this could have been due to\nthe fact that his eyes had not been used for a long time, or to their\nnot having had enough time to recover from the operation. They pointed\nout that Cheselden had, perhaps, asked the boy leading questions. Some\nphilosophers also believed that the results of the inquiry depended on\nthe intelligence of the patient.\n\nThose who criticised the significance of Cheselden\u2019s account in\nthis way (most of them were French philosophes) made\nproposals as to how to avoid the problems mentioned. They suggested\nthat one should prepare the patient carefully for the operation and\nfor the interrogation, that one should allow his eyes time to recover\nfrom the operation and that one should give him the opportunity to\nexercise his eyes in darkness. What is more, one should avoid asking\nleading questions.\n\nSome philosophers were even more radically critical of operations like\nthat performed by Cheselden. M\u00e9rian, for example, noticed that\nCheselden\u2019s observations, like all observations of blind people\nwhose cataracts have been extracted, present difficulties because\ncataracts do not cause complete blindness and complete blindness\ncannot be cured. It could not be concluded from this that\nMolyneux\u2019s problem could not be solved experimentally, however,\nfor it could be maintained that patients operated upon for cataracts\nare directly relevant to the solution of it. They are unable to\nperceive form before they are operated upon, and the essential issue\nat stake when posing Molyneux\u2019s problem is the ability to\ndistinguish and name forms. This is a point of view which was taken by\nmany philosophers.\n\n4. Empirical Approaches in the Nineteenth Century\n\nAbout 1800 several developments occurred which justify the speaking of\na new period in the history of Molyneux\u2019s problem. New accounts\nof patients operated on for cataracts were published, and shed fresh\nlight on the issue. Whereas Cheselden had only noticed what his\npatient observed in more or less natural circumstances, later\nophthalmologists performed experiments which showed whether their\npatients were able to see form, size, distance, etc. Some, such as\nFranz and Nunneley, were especially interested in Molyneux\u2019s\nproblem as such, and performed experiments with the prescribed globe\nand cube. Some of the reports were in agreement with that of\nCheselden, others conflicted with it. The cases could not easily be\ncompared, however, since the pre- and post-operative circumstances\ndiffered to such a great extent. As one might have expected, an\nextended scale of possible solutions to the Molyneux problem was\nbrought under consideration.\n\nWhat is more, specialists also began to consider observations\nconcerning the sight of newly born animals and babies when discussing\nMolyneux\u2019s problem. Some of those doing research in the field,\nsuch as Adam Smith and Johannes M\u00fcller, supposed that the sight\nof young animals could be compared with that of a person who had been\nmade to see. The fact that certain animals see objects at a distance\nas soon as they are born suggested that Molyneux\u2019s question\ncould be answered affirmatively. This turned out to be a strong\nargument against Berkeley\u2019s theory of vision. Others, Thomas\nBrown for instance, were of the opinion that the visual behaviour of\nbabies could be compared with that of a blind person who had been\noperated upon and made to see. They were convinced that in both cases\nseeing has to be learned, and that Molyneux\u2019s question had,\ntherefore, to be answered in the negative.\n\nWheatstone\u2019s discovery that the perception by sight of the third\ndimension of space is immediate, was used as a reason for answering\nMolyneux\u2019s question affirmatively. The discovery was also\nregarded as disproving Berkeley\u2019s theory of vision.\n\nThe data concerning the sight of patients who had been operated upon\nfor cataracts, and of young animals and infants, were used as evidence\nin the debate concerning the question of whether the perception of\nspace is innate or acquired. Although Molyneux\u2019s problem was\nfrequently discussed in this debate, there was still no agreement on\nthe right solution to it.\n5. Modern Approaches\n\nDuring the course of the twentieth century, the main interest in\nMolyneux\u2019s problem has been historical. Biographers and\ncommentators dealing with well-known philosophers have analysed the\nsolutions they proposed for it. Molyneux\u2019s problem has also\nturned up frequently in textbooks and general histories of psychology,\nophthalmology, neurophysiology, etcetera (and also in publications on\ndiverse disciplines, like mathematics, architecture, literature, arts\nand sports). A few authors have written brief and incomplete histories\nof the problem. Degenaar (1996) has written a comprehensive survey of\nthe history of the discussion about Molyneux\u2019s problem. Riskin\n(2002) described Molyneux\u2019s problem in the wider context of the\nEnlightenment.\n\nPhilosophers, psychologists and other scientists have also tried to\nsolve the Molyneux problem by making use of alternative approaches,\nboth old and new. They have, for example, made use of various accounts\nof recovery from early blindness. As was to be expected, these proved\nto be as problematic and inconclusive as were their predecessors in\nthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\nThe Molyneux problem has also been tackled by methods more amenable to\nexperimental control than is possible in clinical studies, namely by\nrearing animals in darkness. Visual deprivation experiments have shown\nthat during the development of the visual system there is a certain\ncritical period in connection with the presentation of light patterns.\nDuring this period, changes brought about by deprivation can be\nreversed. If exposure to light is postponed for too long, however, the\ndevelopment of normal visual mechanisms will be extremely difficult,\nif not impossible. Although the results of deprivation experiments are\nnot relevant to the solution of Molyneux\u2019s\nproblem\u2014Molyneux supposed that his blind man had a good visual\nsystem, whereas that of deprived animals is abnormal\u2014they have\nbeen used as evidence for Locke\u2019s position.\n\nA different approach to Molyneux\u2019s problem involves the use of\nsensory substitution devices, developed in the context of corporeal\nmobility or reading (Morgan, 1977). Learning how to use sensory\nsubstitution systems has been considered a good approximation to\nMolyneux\u2019s problem, since such systems present information\nnormally handled by one modality, such as vision, to another sense,\ntypically audition or touch, using forms of coding novel to the user.\nExperiments with sensory substitution systems show that subjects need\nsome time to learn to distinguish and identify objects, and this has\nbeen interpreted as a confirmation of the position of Molyneux and\nLocke. Some researchers have stressed the fact that a sensory aid is\nnot, strictly speaking, a new modality, and that to learn to use such\ndevices is only an approximation to Molyneux\u2019s problem,\ndepending as it does upon the raising of similar issues.\n\nAnother variation of Molyneux\u2019s problem was suggested by Evans\n(1985). He wondered whether the visual cortex of a patient with\ncongenital blindness could be electrically stimulated in such a way\nthat the patient experiences a pattern of light flashes (phosphenes)\nin the shape of a square or circle. This question has been\ninvestigated experimentally, but the results do not provide a final\nanswer to Molyneux\u2019s question (see Jacomuzzi, Kobau and Bruno\n2003 for discussion).\n\nMore recently, Gallagher (2005, ch. 7) argued that modern\ndevelopmental psychology and neurophysiology suggest that\nLocke\u2019s reaction to Molyneux\u2019s question was right, but for\nthe wrong reasons.\n\nA more or less straightforward attempt to answer Molyneux\u2019s\nquestion empirically has been carried out during the last decade. One\nreason that Molyneux\u2019s problem could be posed in the first place\nis the dearth of human subjects who gain vision after extended\ncongenital blindness. It has been estimated that less than twenty\ncases have been found in the last 1000 years (Valvo 1971). In Western\ncountries the vast majority of cases of curable congenital blindness\nare detected in infancy and treated as early as possible. However,\nmany congenitally blind children in developing countries often do not\nreceive treatment despite having curable conditions because of\ninadequate medical services. In 2003, Pawan Sinha set up a program in\nIndia as a part of which he treated five patients, aged from 8 to 17\nyears, that almost instantly took them from total congenital blindness\nto fully seeing. This provided an opportunity to answer\nMolyneux\u2019s problem empirically. Based on this study, it was\nconcluded that the answer to Molyneux\u2019s question is likely\nnegative. Although after restoration of sight, the subjects could\ndistinguish between objects visually as effectively as they would do\nby touch alone, they were unable to form the connection between object\nperceived using the two different senses. The results of the\ntouch-to-vision tests were barely better than if the subjects had\nguessed. However, such cross-modal mappings developed rapidly, in the\ncourse of a few days (Held, et al., 2011). \n\nA fruitful tendency is taking Molyneux\u2019s problem to be a cluster\nof\n subproblems[3]\n or generating different versions of or variations on Molyneux\u2019s\nproblem (e.g. Glenney, 2013 and Matthen and Cohen, 2020). \n\nA valuable contribution to the discussion about Molyneux\u2019s\nProblem is Ferretti and Glenney (2021), a collection of one poem and\ntwenty essays that explore the long-standing issues Molyneux\u2019s\nproblem presents to philosophy of mind, perception and the senses. It\nconsiders the question from an interdisciplinary angle, examines its\npre-history, and perspectives from religion and disability. The essays\nare arranged around five criticisms: (1) Molyneux\u2019s\nappropriation of the question from another source; (2) the\nencouragement of bias against people with blindness, a social failure\ncalled ocularism; (3) a lack of specificity resulting in ambiguity as\nto what might count as a satisfying answer; (4) a crude generality\nthat belies the underlying complexity of vision and touch; and (5) the\nincapability to be experimentally testable, though presumably designed\nto be so (Ferretti and Glenney, 2021, p. 2).\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe history of the issues surrounding Molyneux\u2019s question shows\nthat the question was not as easy to answer as Molyneux himself may\nhave assumed. On the contrary, there is no problem in the history of\nthe philosophy of perception that has provoked more thought than the\nproblem that Molyneux raised in 1688. In this sense, Molyneux\u2019s\nproblem is one the most fruitful thought-experiments ever proposed in\nthe history of philosophy, which is still as intriguing today as when\nMolyneux first formulated it more than three centuries ago.\n",
