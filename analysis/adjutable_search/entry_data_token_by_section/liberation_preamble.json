    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophy of Liberation is the collective name for a philosophical\nmovement and method of doing philosophy that emerged at first in\nArgentina during the late sixties, but that went on to spread\nthroughout Latin American during the early seventies. It is for this\nreason that sometimes some critics and historiographers of the\nphilosophy of liberation make reference to a \u201cstrict\u201d and\na \u201cbroad\u201d conception of the philosophy of liberation, in\norder to refer to the immediate context of its earliest articulations,\nand to its later general dissemination and development. The philosophy\nof liberation belongs to the \u201cmaturity\u201d stage within the\n\u201ccontemporary\u201d period of Latin American philosophy, if we\nuse Jorge J.E. Gracia and Manuel Vargas\u2019s periodization of Latin\nAmerican philosophy (Gracia and Vargas 2013). Without question,\nhowever, the philosophy of liberation is the distinct manifestation of\nLatin American philosophy that has received the most international\nattention, and that has had the most influence both within Latin\nAmerica and the United\n States[1].\n\nWhile the philosophy of liberation is deeply rooted in the history and\ndebates of Latin American philosophy, to the extent that it may be\nclaimed that it is the most elaborate and substantive response to the\ntask articulating a distinct Latin American philosophy, it is\nnonetheless also a chapter within the broader history of European\nphilosophy. Even as it defines itself as a critique of Eurocentrism\nand the hegemony of European philosophy, it has evolved out of and\nmade use of its philosophical currents, movements, concepts and\ndebates. Some may be argue that the philosophy of liberation belongs\nto phenomenology, hermeneutics, and Marxism, or more generally,\nhistorical materialism. In fact, because many philosophers of\nliberation came out of these different traditions, the philosophy of\nliberation was and remains from the outset an internally heterogeneous\nmovement. This heterogeneity has increased as some philosophers have\nengaged in what Enrique Dussel has called a \u201cSouth-South\nDialogue,\u201d in which philosophies from the so-called\n\u201cglobal south\u201d address each other directly without\ndeferring to the authority of dominant Euro-American philosophy\n(Dussel 2015).\n\nThe philosophy of liberation aims to think the distinct place and role\nof Latin American in world history using what are argued to be\nautochthonous cultural and intellectual resources, from out of a\nsituation of economic, cultural, political, and philosophical\ndependency. It has a practical aim: liberation. In very general terms,\nthe philosophy of liberation defines itself as a counter-philosophical\ndiscourse, whether it be as a critique of colonialism, imperialism,\nglobalization, racism, and sexism, which is articulated from out of\nthe experience of exploitation, destitution, alienation and\nreification, in the name of the projects of liberation, autonomy and\nauthenticity. That is, the philosophy of liberation has presented\nitself as an \u201cepistemic rupture\u201d that aims to critique and\nchallenge not only basic assumptions and themes of Euro-American\nphilosophy, but also to make philosophy more responsive to\u00a0and\nresponsible for the socio-political situation in which it always finds\nitself. Thus, by \u201ccounter-philosophical discourse\u201d,\nphilosophers of liberation did not mean that it was\n\u201canti-philosophical\u201d. Instead, they meant to emphasize a\nheightened degree of reflexiveness or self-awareness in their\ntheorizing. Positively, the philosophy of liberation affirms cultural\ndiversity, gender and racial equality, and political sovereignty. In\nmore recent years, some philosophers of liberation have been using the\nlanguage of \u201cpluriversality,\u201d instead of\n\u201cuniversality,\u201d to refer to this fundamental affirmation\nand celebration of global cultural diversity (Dussel 2015; Mignolo\n2011). The philosophy of liberation\u2019s philosophical orbit is\ndefined by the axes of critique, commitment, engagement, and\nliberation. As a critique of all forms of philosophical dependency and\ninauthenticity, it is consciously and avowedly a metaphilosophy. The\nphilosophy of liberation is thus, among other things, a view about\nwhat counts as philosophy and how it should be pursued.\n\nThis article is divided into four main parts: history, background,\ncurrents, and themes and debates.\n",
