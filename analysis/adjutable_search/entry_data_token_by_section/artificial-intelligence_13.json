    "main_text": "Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence || The Chinese Room Argument Against \u201cStrong AI\u201d\n8.2 The Chinese Room Argument Against \u201cStrong AI\u201d\n\nWithout question, the most famous argument in the philosophy of AI is\nJohn Searle\u2019s (1980) Chinese Room Argument (CRA), designed to\noverthrow \u201cStrong\u201d AI. We present a quick summary here and\na \u201creport from the trenches\u201d as to how AI practitioners\nregard the argument. Readers wanting to further study CRA will find an\nexcellent next step in the entry on\n the Chinese Room Argument\n and (Bishop & Preston 2002). \n\nCRA is based on a thought-experiment in which Searle himself stars. He\nis inside a room; outside the room are native Chinese speakers who\ndon\u2019t know that Searle is inside it. Searle-in-the-box, like\nSearle-in-real-life, doesn\u2019t know any Chinese, but is fluent in\nEnglish. The Chinese speakers send cards into the room through a slot;\non these cards are written questions in Chinese. The box, courtesy of\nSearle\u2019s secret work therein, returns cards to the native\nChinese speakers as output. Searle\u2019s output is produced by\nconsulting a rulebook: this book is a lookup table that tells him what\nChinese to produce based on what is sent in. To Searle, the Chinese is\nall just a bunch of \u2013 to use Searle\u2019s language \u2013\nsquiggle-squoggles. The following schematic picture sums up the\nsituation. The labels should be obvious. \\(O\\) denotes the outside\nobservers, in this case the Chinese speakers. Input is denoted by\n\\(i\\) and output by \\(o\\). As you can see, there is an icon for the\nrulebook, and Searle himself is denoted by \\(P\\).\n\n\n\nThe Chinese Room, Schematic View\n\n\nNow, what is the argument based on this thought-experiment? Even if\nyou\u2019ve never heard of CRA before, you doubtless can see the\nbasic idea: that Searle (in the box) is supposed to be everything a\ncomputer can be, and because he doesn\u2019t understand Chinese, no\ncomputer could have such understanding. Searle is mindlessly moving\nsquiggle-squoggles around, and (according to the argument)\nthat\u2019s all computers do,\n fundamentally.[39]\n\nWhere does CRA stand today? As we\u2019ve already indicated, the\nargument would still seem to be alive and well; witness (Bishop &\nPreston 2002). However, there is little doubt that at least among AI\npractitioners, CRA is generally rejected. (This is of course\nthoroughly unsurprising.) Among these practitioners, the philosopher\nwho has offered the most formidable response out of AI itself is\nRapaport (1988), who argues that while AI systems are indeed\nsyntactic, the right syntax can constitute semantics. It should be\nsaid that a common attitude among proponents of \u201cStrong\u201d\nAI is that CRA is not only unsound, but silly, based as it is on a\nfanciful story (CR) far removed from the practice of AI\n\u2013 practice which is year by year moving ineluctably toward\nsophisticated robots that will once and for all silence CRA and its\nproponents. For example, John Pollock (as we\u2019ve noted,\nphilosopher and practitioner of AI) writes: \n\nOnce [my intelligent system] OSCAR is fully functional, the argument\nfrom analogy will lead us inexorably to attribute thoughts and\nfeelings to OSCAR with precisely the same credentials with which we\nattribute them to human beings. Philosophical arguments to the\ncontrary will be pass\u00e9. (Pollock 1995, p. 6)\n\n\nTo wrap up discussion of CRA, we make two quick points, to wit: \n\n Despite the confidence of the likes of Pollock about the eventual\nirrelevance of CRA in the face of the eventual human-level prowess of\nOSCAR (and, by extension, any number of other still-improving AI\nsystems), the brute fact is that deeply semantic natural-language\nprocessing (NLP) is rarely even pursued these days, so proponents of\nCRA are certainly not the ones feeling some discomfort in light of the\ncurrent state of AI. In short, Searle would rightly point to any of\nthe success stories of AI, including the Watson system we have\ndiscussed, and still proclaim that understanding is nowhere to be\nfound \u2013 and he would be well within his philosophical rights in\nsaying this. \n It would appear that the CRA is bubbling back to a level of\nengagement not seen for a number of years, in light of the empirical\nfact that certain thinkers are now issuing explicit warnings to the\neffect that future conscious, malevolent machines may well wish to do\nin our species. In reply, Searle (2014) points out that since CRA is\nsound, there can\u2019t be conscious machines; and if there\ncan\u2019t be conscious machines, there can\u2019t be malevolent\nmachines that wish anything. We return to this at the end of our\nentry; the chief point here is that CRA continues to be quite\nrelevant, and indeed we suspect that Searle\u2019s basis for\nhave-no-fear will be taken up energetically by not only philosophers,\nbut AI experts, futurists, lawyers, and policy-makers. \n\n\nReaders may wonder if there are philosophical debates that AI\nresearchers engage in, in the course of working in their field (as\nopposed to when they might attend a philosophy conference). Surely, AI\nresearchers have philosophical discussions amongst themselves, right?\n\n\nGenerally, one finds that AI researchers do discuss among themselves\ntopics in philosophy of AI, and these topics are usually the very same\nones that occupy philosophers of AI. However, the attitude reflected\nin the quote from Pollock immediately above is by far the dominant\none. That is, in general, the attitude of AI researchers is that\nphilosophizing is sometimes fun, but the upward march of AI\nengineering cannot be stopped, will not fail, and will eventually\nrender such philosophizing otiose. \n\nWe will return to the issue of the future of AI in the\n final section\n of this entry. \n",
