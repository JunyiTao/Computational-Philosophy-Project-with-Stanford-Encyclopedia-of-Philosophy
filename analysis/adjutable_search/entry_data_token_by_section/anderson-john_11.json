    "main_text": "Influence Beyond the University\n7. Conclusion\n\nWhile sharing some of the deflationary ambitions of linguistic,\nscientific and pragmatist philosophies with respect to traditional\nmetaphysics and rationalism, Anderson\u2019s philosophy was a\nsingular expression of twentieth century philosophy emerging from the\nworld of 19th century idealism. Not only are the terms Anderson\nemploys systematically misleading to contemporary readers; his work\nbelongs to a world of higher philosophical ambition, a world in which\nphilosophy could aspire to a central role in cultural affairs, unlike\nthe \u201crickety philosophical apparatus\u201d and the whole\n\u201cintellectual mess\u201d that he saw in mid-century philosophy\n(EMP, 187\u201388).\n\nThe current lack of philosophical interest in Anderson seems to derive\nas much from external factors related to his place in Australian\nintellectual life as from the intrinsic qualities of his work. This is\ndue in part to his posthumous role in the culture wars prompted by his\nstrongly anti-communist stance in the 1950s. Any consideration of his\nwork soon becomes entangled in unwelcome and extraneous debates.\nMoreover, compounding \u201ca certain Presbyterian\nintransigence\u201d in his personality (EAI, 22),\nAnderson\u2019s conception of philosophy as something of a master\ndiscipline legislating legitimate forms of inquiry in the sciences,\npsychology, social studies, literature, linguistics, and the\nhumanities made him an unpopular figure in the academy (cf.\nPartridge\u2019s and Kamenka\u2019s accounts of their studies with\nAnderson in EAI).\n\nDavid Armstrong describes Anderson as \u201ca failed great\nphilosopher \u2013 he played for higher stakes than the rest of\nus\u201d (personal communication). A certain ambivalence creeps into\nsuch assessments of his importance. On the other hand, while there are\nthose who regard Anderson as almost heroically holding out against\nfalse philosophical fashions, there are many who regard his dominance\nat Sydney as wholly negative: his indifference to developments in\ntechnical logic since the 19th century, to developments in theoretical\nphysics and to philosophical interest in linguistic usage and the\nnature of scientific inquiry. Did Anderson sustain traditional\nphilosophical values and standards of inquiry in the face of\nfragmentary and unsound philosophical trends, or did he cut Sydney\nstudents off from the life blood of international philosophical and\nscientific exposure? The philosophical prominence of many of his\nstudents strongly suggests the former, but even his most loyal\nfollowers recognise in his educational practice a tendency to promote\nuncritical conformity.\n\nIn the end the issue concerns the value and depth of a tradition of\nphilosophical inquiry and apprenticeship, weighed against the\nopportunity costs of pursuing such a tradition to the exclusion of all\nothers. This question was posed rather urgently a decade after\nAnderson\u2019s death when the department of philosophy at Sydney\nsplit into two distinct units, immediately on political grounds, but\ninevitably also over the nature of philosophical inquiry and study\nitself. Although the department was eventually re-united as a single\nprofessional and productive unit, its members have very little\ninterest in revisiting a troubled history. And this applies most\nparticularly to the highly distinctive work and legacy of Professor\nJohn Anderson, the dominant force in philosophy at Sydney for much of\nthe twentieth century.\n",
