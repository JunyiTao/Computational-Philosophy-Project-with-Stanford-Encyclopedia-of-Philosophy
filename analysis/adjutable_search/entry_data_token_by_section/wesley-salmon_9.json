    "main_text": "Explanation and Causality || The S-R Model\n5.2 The S-R Model\n\nAccording to the S-R model, in order to explain an event one must\nexhibit all the factors that are statistically relevant to its\nhappening, without mentioning irrelevant elements, so that an\nexplanatory account should include only information that is genuinely\nexplanatory. In order to accomplish this task, the event explanandum\nmust be referred to a homogeneous reference class, namely to\nthe class containing all and only the relevant properties. Homogeneity\nis obtained through statistically relevant partitions of\nnon-homogeneous reference classes into mutually exclusive and\nexhaustive sub-classes. Statistical relevance, providing the tool to\nattain homogeneity, is defined as follows. Let A stand for\nthe reference class including some event of which one wants to\nestablish the probability of possessing the property B; \\(p\n(B \\mid A)\\) be the probability of B within the reference\nclass A, and C be another property by which the\nclass A can be divided into two sub-classes \\((A \\amp C)\\)\nand \\((A \\amp \\msim C)\\); the property C is statistically\nrelevant with respect to B in A if and only if \\(p\n(B \\amp C \\mid A) \\ne p (B \\mid A)\\). A homogeneous partition of a\nreference class does not admit further relevant partitions, and the\nresulting sub-classes must be maximal, in the sense that no irrelevant\nproperties are retained.\n\nIn some cases partitioning a reference class A can result in\ntwo sub-classes \\((A \\amp C)\\) and \\((A \\amp \\msim C)\\) both\nhomogeneous with respect to a given property B. This means\nthat property B is held by all elements belonging to class\n\\((A \\amp C)\\), but none of the elements belonging to \\((A \\amp \\msim\nC)\\). In all other cases the class A will be partitioned into\nk homogeneous sub-classes \\((A \\amp C_{k})\\) such that\n\n\\[p (B \\mid A \\amp C_{i}) \\ne p (B \\mid A \\amp C_{j}),\\]\n\n\nfor \\(i \\ne j\\). Such a procedure is the content of a rule of\nmultiple homogeneity which \u201cexpresses the fundamental\ncondition for adequate explanation of particular events\u201d (Salmon\n1970b [1971: 59]). Fulfillment of this rule guarantees against the\ninclusion of irrelevant information in the explanatory account. Once\nthe process leading to the specification of a homogeneous reference\nclass is completed, the event to be explained is associated with a\nprobability distribution. The shift from a non-homogeneous to a\nhomogeneous reference class embodies the explanatory power of the S-R\nmodel, according to which\n\n\nan explanation is an assemblage of factors that are statistically\nrelevant to the occurrence of the event to be explained, accompanied\nby an associated probability distribution. (Salmon 1979c: 68)\n\n\nThe shift in question involves an increase in information, although\nnot necessarily an increase in probability. Given that Salmon does not\nrequire relevance to be positive, the procedure described can result\nin a higher as well as a lower probability of the explanandum. In this\nperspective what counts for the sake of explanation is not high\nprobability, as required by Hempel, but being in a position to assert\nthat the probability distribution associated with the explanandum\nreflects the most complete and detailed information attainable. This\ninformation is conveyed by a homogeneous partition of the reference\nclass, together with a statement specifying to which cell of that\npartition the explanandum event belongs.\n\nAs observed\n (\u00a7 2.1),\n the objective homogeneity of the reference class is an ideal not free\nfrom difficulties, because one can hardly ever be sure to have taken\ninto account all relevant information. Well aware of this, Salmon\nadmits that in practice\n\n\nwe often lack full knowledge of the properties relevant to a given\nattribute, so we do not know whether our reference class is\nhomogeneous or not. (Salmon 1970b [1971: 44])\n\n\nTherefore, in most cases use is made of epistemically\nhomogeneous reference classes, namely those relative to a given\nknowledge situation.\n",
