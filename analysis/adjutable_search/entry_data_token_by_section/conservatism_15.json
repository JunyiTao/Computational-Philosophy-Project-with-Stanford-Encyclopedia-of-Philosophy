    "main_text": "Critiques of conservatism || The coherence of particularist scepticism\n4. Cultural conservatism and conservation\n\nEspecially since the advent of green politics, there have been\nconservatives who have advocated ecological conservation. Scruton\nargues that \u201cconservatism and conservation\u201d are two\naspects of a single policy of husbanding resources, including social\ncapital embodied in laws, customs, and institutions, and material\ncapital of the environment (Scruton 2007). A less noticed parallel is\nthat between two oppositions: cultural conservation v. modernism, and\nconservatism v. revolutionary Jacobinism (Cohen 2007, Other Internet\nResources). In Britain after World War II, for instance, restorable\nbomb-damaged buildings were demolished to make way for modernist\nschemes later revealed as shoddy and cheap. Analogously, in\nContinental Europe, classical composers treated 1945 as \u201cyear\nzero\u201d, rejecting all tradition. Conservatives would criticise\nboth developments.\n\nLeading modernist poet T.S. Eliot (1888\u20131965) was also an\nimportant conservative thinker, and so occupies an ambivalent\nposition. His essay \u201cTradition and the Individual Talent\u201d\n(1919) argued that true originality is possible only within a\ntradition, which is a living presence in the modern world, not a\nmuseum relic (Eliot 1919; see Hamilton 2009). Eliot\u2019s notion of\nan artistic tradition, and the related notion of a living classic,\nhelps to elucidate the conservative notion of a living\ntradition\u2014a classic is something that has stood the test of\ntime, and is the subject of continuing reference and allusion. There\nare \u201cdead classics\u201d or \u201cdead\ntraditions\u201d\u2014performing arts with rigid repertoires such as\nthat of Gregorian chant, which became closed by the time of the\nRenaissance. In contrast, the classical repertoire of Western art\nmusic, as it had evolved from the 18th century to the present, is open\nand flexible. It operates\u2014when circumstances are\npropitious\u2014as a living presence in contemporary culture. On a\nless exalted aesthetic level, in the same sense the tuxedo is a living\nsartorial classic.\n\nThese cultural issues are central to G.A. Cohen\u2019s work on\nconservatism in political and cultural spheres. Cohen argues for a\ntruth in Burkean conservatism that is compatible with liberalism and\nsocialism, viz. that we should accept some things as given:\n\n\n[the rationalist claim that] everything can, or should, be shaped to\nour aims and requirements\u2026violates intrinsic value and\ncontradicts our own spiritual requirements. (2007: 9)\n\n\nIn this sense, everyone is conservative to some degree\u2014for\ninstance, if they prefer to have cash in their pocket rather than\nconverting to cashless payment. Thus a William Morris-based socialism\nis conservative in rejecting what planners and developers do to the\nenvironment that one loves; Robert Conquest allegedly commented that\n\u201ceveryone is conservative about what they know best\u201d\n(quoted in Kates 2014). Conservation originated in the Victorian era.\nThe Camden Society, in early Victorian Cambridge, was concerned with\nthe \u201cproper\u201d and edifying construction and restoration of\nGothic churches and other public buildings. Later in the\n19th century, William Morris\u2019s\n\u201canti-scrape\u201d campaign introduced the idea that good\nbuildings of different periods complement each other and should be\ncherished. Morris argued that we should take delight in the history of\nold public buildings, and not seek to restore them to some pristine\nstate of perfection. \n\nMorris\u2019s position is conservative in Cohen\u2019s sense. For Cohen,\nconservatives aim to conserve particular valuable things, rather than\nmaximising value. This is \u201cconservation of value\u201d, but not\non the model of \u201cconservation of energy\u201d:\n\n\nvalue itself is conserved, when you destroy something valuable and\nreplace it by a thing of the same value. The conservative policy is\nnot to keep the value rating high but to keep the things that now\ncontribute to that rating. (2007: 10, Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nConservatism in this sense rules out utility-maximising\nconsequentialism:\n\n\nUnlike the conservative, the utilitarian is indifferent between adding\nto what we\u2019ve now got, at no cost, something that has five units\nof value, and adding something worth ten units of value at the expense\nof destroying something worth five. (Cohen 2007: 15, Other Internet\nResources)\n\n\nConservatism in this sense might be regarded as a relatively expensive\ntaste, because it sacrifices value, in order not to sacrifice things\nthat have value.\n\nIt does not follow that conservatives welcome good new things any less\nthan non-conservatives do, Cohen argues. One can admire Byzantine\nicons partly because of their antiquity, and admire Frank\nGehry\u2019s architecture partly because of its newness. However,\nCohen continues, conservatives can regard modernisation as beneficial\noverall, while lamenting what has been lost\u2014admiring a splendid\nnew building, yet grieving over what it replaced. Both the economic\nmarket, and state planning, are inimical to \u201csentimental\u201d\nor personal value, Cohen argues. \n\nSome planners might accept that a building\u2019s existing is a\nreason to keep it, Cohen allows, but usually they require a more\ngeneral consideration\u2014something that it does well, or a\nmajority\u2019s desire that it remain. This is not the\nmajority\u2019s reason for keeping it, however:\n\n\nMarket and planning logics tend against the truth that people want\nparticular valuable things, not just satisfaction of general\ndesiderata\u2026market mania is deeply anti-conservative\u2026If\nyou want everything to be optimal, nothing will be good. Some things\nhave to just be\u2026there, if anything is to be good. (2012:\n27)\n\n\nCohen echoes Burke in his explanation of our desire to conserve\nparticular things:\n\n\nWe are attached to particular things because we need to belong to\nsomething\u2026 We do not keep the cathedrals just because\nthey\u2019re beautiful, but also because they are part of our\npast\u2026[We] value our particular past in the respectful way that\nwe value any past culture, but [also] in a more personal way. We want\nto be part of [Burke\u2019s] \u201cpartnership\u2026between those\nwho are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be\nborn\u201d. (Cohen 2007: 28, Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nCohen here assumes that all parties agree on how \u201cvalue\u201d\nis to be measured and what therefore contributes to the value rating.\nBut although relativistic conservatives accept socially prevalent\nvaluations, revising them piecemeal on the basis of internal\ninconsistency or impracticality, non-relativistic conservatives might\ndeny that value can be quantified at all.\n\nCohen\u2019s conservative model would look favorably on the organic\ndevelopment exhibited by medieval English towns and\nbuildings\u2014perhaps especially by churches\u2014and which\nparallels the organic model of political development. This model\nrejects the concept of a blueprint involving an individual creator.\nRather, the town or building evolves\u2014apparently without a plan,\nover generations\u2014, and often without stylistic consistency. The\nchurch as a building\u2014or on the conservative model, a\nsociety\u2014are like organisms, seemingly not the product of\nindividual intentional action, but evolving naturally. Most English\nparish churches of medieval foundation were not built according to a\nsingle design, but developed by addition and subtraction; in the\nMiddle Ages there was no profession of architect. Plans were produced\nby the master builder but it is contested how much there was an\nintentional, uniform schema generated prior to construction:\n\n\nA church building is inherently conservative, and except for the\nextraordinary intervention, changed very slowly. A large proportion of\nchurches had been founded by at least the late 12th\ncentury, many appearing in the Doomsday census of 1089. Elements from\nthese early buildings often survive in the doorways or the base of\ntowers, showing typical rounded arches and massive walls of the Norman\nstyle. Additions over time could include a reconstructed window, a new\nbaptismal font, a tomb sculpture, or a series of carved wooden choir\nstalls for the clergy, attesting to differing eras of piety and style.\n(Stanbury and Raguin 2009, Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nThe parallel with conservative political thought is suggested by\nScruton in his discussion of public space (Scruton 1994).\n\nScruton advocates architecture as a vernacular, public art form on an\nurban scale, in the manner of treatises on urban decorum from the\nRenaissance onwards, which subordinate the style of the individual\nbuilding to the whole. Unlike models that achieve this subordination\nby conscious planning, Scruton envisages a process akin to the\nself-ordering of an ideal competitive market. He applies Adam\nSmith\u2019s metaphor of the invisible hand to the emergence of urban\norder, rejecting the utopian, social revolutionary visions of Gropius,\nLe Corbusier and other modernists. These writers sharply separate\narchitecture and \u201cmere\u201d building in a way opposed to\nScruton\u2019s vernacularism.  A district of London such\nas North Kensington, where planning was at best rudimentary, and which\nhas few \u201cpublic spaces\u201d in the planner\u2019s sense, is\n\u201ceminently public\u201d, Scruton argues (1994).\n\nThe debate in architecture and aesthetics parallels that in the\npolitical sphere. Does cultural or artistic conservatism in\nCohen\u2019s sense conserve everything in the past, or only what is\ngood? For the non-relativistic conservative, which I have argued is\nthe profounder form of conservatism, there has to be some criterion of\nvalue in past things, involving in part their participation in a\nliving tradition. To develop and defend such a criterion is one of the\nmajor challenges facing conservative thinkers, in both political and\ncultural spheres. \n",
