    "main_text": "Logic\n3. Logic\n\nDue to the affinity of many ideas of Bolzano\u2019s logic with ideas\nof modern logic, attempts to reconstruct Bolzano\u2019s logic by\nmeans of techniques of modern logic started very early, e.g., with\nDubislav 1931 and Scholz 1937. The first overall reconstruction of\nBolzano\u2019s logic from the perspective of modern logic was given\nby Berg 1962, and Berg went into it further in his illuminating\nintroductions to WL in BGA I, 11\u201314. A new overall survey of\nBolzano\u2019s logic was presented in Sebestik 1992, and the most\nrecent one is Casari 2016.\n",
