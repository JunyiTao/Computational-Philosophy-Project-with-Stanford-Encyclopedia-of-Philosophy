When is\na product too unsafe to be sold? This question is often answered by\ngovernment agencies. In the U.S., a number of government agencies,\nincluding the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the National\nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA), are responsible for assessing the safety of\nproducts for the consumer market. In some cases these standards are\nmandatory (e.g., medicines and medical devices); in other cases they\nare voluntary (e.g., trampolines and tents). The state identifies\nminimum standards and individual businesses can choose to adopt more\nstringent ones.\n\nQuestions about product safety are a matter of significant debate\namong economists, legal scholars, and public policy experts. Business\nethicists have paid scant attention to these questions (but see\nBrenkert 1981). Existing treatments often combine discussions of\nsafety with discussions of liability\u2014the question of who should\npay for harms that products cause\u2014and tend to be found in\nbusiness ethics textbooks. One of the most careful treatments is\nVelasquez\u2019s (2012). He distinguishes three (compatible) views:\n(1) the \u201ccontract view\u201d, according to which the\nmanufacturer\u2019s duty is only to accurately disclose all risks\nassociated with the product; (2) the \u201cdue care view\u201d,\naccording to which the manufacturer should exercise due care to\nprevent buyers from being injured by the product; and (3) the\n\u201csocial costs view\u201d, according to which the manufacturer\nshould pay for any injuries the product causes, even if the\nmanufacturer has accurately disclosed all risks associated with the\nproduct and has exercised due care to prevent injury (see also\nBoatright & Smith 2017). In the U.S. and elsewhere, the law has\nmoved in the direction of the social costs view, where it is known as\n\u201cstrict liability\u201d.\n\nThere is much room for philosophical exploration of these issues. One\narea that merits attention is the definitions of key terms, such as\n\u201csafety\u201d and \u201crisk\u201d. Drop side cribs pose\nrisks to consumers; so do trampolines. On what basis should the former\nbe prohibited but the latter not be (Hasnas 2010)? The answer must\ntake into account the value of these products, how obvious the risks\nthey pose are, and the availability of substitutes. With respect to\nliability, we may wonder whether it is fair to hold manufacturers\nresponsible for harms their products cause, when the manufacturers are\nnot morally at fault for those harms. On the other hand, it may be\nunfair to force consumers to bear the full costs of their injuries,\nwhen they too are not morally at fault. The question may be one for\nsociety as a whole: what is the most efficient or just way to\ndistribute these costs?\n",
