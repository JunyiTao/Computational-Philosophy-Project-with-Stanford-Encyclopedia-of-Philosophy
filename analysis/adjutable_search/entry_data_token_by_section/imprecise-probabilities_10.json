    "main_text": "Motivations || Group belief\n2.7 Group belief\nSuppose we wanted our epistemology to apply not just to\nindividuals, but to \u201cgroup agents\u201d like committees,\ngovernments, companies, and so on. Such agents may be made up of\nmembers who disagree. Levi (1986, 1999)\nhas argued that representation of such conflict is better handled with\nsets of probabilities than with precise probabilities. There is a rich\nliterature on combining or aggregating the (probabilistic) opinions of\nmembers of groups (Genest and Zidek\n1986) but the outcome of such aggregation does not adequately\nrepresent the disagreement among the group. Some forms of\naggregation also fail to respect plausible constraints on group\nbelief. For example, if every member of the group agrees\nthat \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\nare probabilistically independent, then it seems plausible to require\nthat the group belief respects this unanimity. It is, however, well\nknown that linear pooling\u2014a simple and popular form of\naggregation\u2014does not respect this desideratum. Consider two\nprobability functions \\(p, q\\) such\nthat \\(p(X) = p(Y) = 1/3\\)\nand \\(p(X\\mid Y)=p(X)\\)\nwhile \\(q(X) = q(Y) = 2/3\\)\nand \\(q(X\\mid Y)=q(X)\\). Consider\naggregating these two probabilities by taking an unweighted average of\nthem: \\(r = p/2 + q/2\\). Now, calculation\nshows that \\(r(X\\cap Y) = 5/18\\)\nwhile \\(r(X)r(Y) = 1/4\\), thus demonstrating\nthat \\(r\\) does not\nconsider \\(X\\)\nand \\(Y\\) to be independent. So such an\naggregation method does not satisfy the above\ndesideratum (Kyburg and Pittarelli 1992; Cozman\n2012). For more on judgement aggregation in groups,\nsee List and Pettit (2011), especially\nchapter 2.\n\nElkin and Wheeler (2016) argue that resolving disagreement among precise probabilist peers should involve an imprecise probability. Stewart and Quintana (2018) argue that imprecise aggregation methods have some nice properties that no precise aggregation method do.\n\nIf committee members have credences and utilities that\ndiffer among the group, then no precise probability-utility pair\ndistinct from the probabilities and utilities of the agents can\nsatisfy the Pareto\ncondition (Seidenfeld, Kadane, and\nSchervish 1989). The Pareto condition requires that the group\npreference respect agreement of preference among the group. That is,\nif all members of the group prefer \\(A\\)\nto \\(B\\) (that is, if each group member finds\nthat \\(A\\) has higher expected utility\nthan \\(B\\)) then the aggregate preference (as\ndetermined by the aggregate probability-utility pair) should satisfy\nthat preference. Since this \u201cconsensus preservation\u201d is a\nreasonable requirement on aggregation, this result shows that precise\nmodels of group agents are problematic. Walley discusses an example of\na set of probabilities where each probability represents the beliefs\nof a member of a group, then \\(P\\) is an\nincomplete description of the beliefs of each agent, in the sense that\nif all members of \\(P\\) agree on something,\nthen that thing is something each agent believes. Sets of\nprobabilities allow us to represent an agent who\nis conflicted in their\njudgements (Levi 1986, 1999).\n\nIdeally rational agents may face choices where there is no best\noption available to them. Indeterminacy in probability judgement and\nunresolved conflicts between values lead to predicaments where at the\nmoment of choice the rational agent recognizes more than one such\npreference ranking of the available options in [the set of available\nchoices] to be permissible. (Levi 1999:\n510)\n\nLevi also argued that individual agents can be in conflict in the\nsame way as groups, and thus that individuals\u2019 credal states are also\nbetter represented by sets of probabilities. (Levi also argued for\nthe convexity of credal states, which brings him into\nconflict with the above argument about independence (see\n historical appendix\nsection 3).) One doesn\u2019t need to buy the claim that groups and\nindividuals must be modelled in the same way to take something away\nfrom this idea. One merely needs to accept the idea that an individual\ncan be conflicted in such a way that a reasonable\nrepresentation of her belief state\u2014or belief and value\nstate\u2014is in terms of sets of\nfunctions. Bradley (2009) calls members\nof such sets \u201cavatars\u201d. This suggests that we interpret an\nindividual\u2019s credal set as a credal committee made up of her\navatars. This interpretation of the representor is due\nto Joyce (2011), though Joyce attributes\nit Adam Elga. This committee represents all the possible prior\nprobabilities you could have that are consistent with the\nevidence. Each credal committee member is a fully opinionated Jamesian\nvoluntarist. The committee as a whole, collectively, is a Cliffordian\nobjectivist.\n",
