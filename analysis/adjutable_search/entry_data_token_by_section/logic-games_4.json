    "main_text": "Semantic Games for Other Logics\n5. Semantic Games for Other Logics\n\nStructures of the following kind give rise to interesting games. The\nstructure \\(A\\) consists of a set \\(S\\) of elements (which we shall\ncall states, adding that they are often called\nworlds), a binary relation \\(R\\) on \\(S\\) (we shall read\n\\(R\\) as arrow), and a family \\(P_1 ,\\ldots ,P_n\\) of subsets\nof \\(S\\). The two players \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\) play a game G on\n\\(A\\), starting at a state \\(s\\) which is given them, by reading a\nsuitable logical formula \\(\\phi\\) as a set of instructions for playing\nand for winning. \n\nThus if \\(\\phi\\) is \\(P_i\\), then player \\(\\exists\\) wins at once if\n\\(s\\) is in \\(P_i\\), and otherwise player \\(\\forall\\) wins at once.\nThe formulas \\(\\psi \\wedge \\theta , \\psi \\vee \\theta\\) and \\(\\neg\n\\psi\\) behave as in Hintikka\u2019s games above; for example \\(\\psi\n\\wedge \\theta\\) instructs player \\(\\forall\\) to choose whether the\ngame shall continue as for \\(\\psi\\) or for \\(\\theta\\). If the formula\n\\(\\phi\\) is \\(\\Box \\psi\\), then player \\(\\forall\\) chooses an arrow\nfrom \\(s\\) to a state \\(t\\) (i.e. a state \\(t\\) such that the pair\n\\((s, t)\\) is in the relation \\(R)\\), and the game then proceeds from\nthe state \\(t\\) according to the instructions \\(\\psi\\). The rule for\n\\(\\Diamond \\psi\\) is the same except that player \\(\\exists\\) makes the\nchoice. Finally we say that the formula \\(\\phi\\) is true at s in\nA if player \\(\\exists\\) has a winning strategy for this game\nbased on \\(\\phi\\) and starting at \\(s\\).\n\nThese games stand to modal logic in very much the same way as\nHintikka\u2019s games stand to first-order logic. In particular they\nare one way of giving a semantics for modal logic, and they agree with\nthe usual Kripke-type semantics. Of course there are many types and\ngeneralisations of modal logic (including closely related logics such\nas temporal, epistemic and dynamic logics), and so the corresponding\ngames come in many different forms. One example of interest is the\ncomputer-theoretic logic of Matthew Hennessy and Robin Milner, used\nfor describing the behaviour of systems; here the arrows come in more\nthan one colour, and moving along an arrow of a particular colour\nrepresents performing a particular \u2018action\u2019 to change the\nstate. Another example is the more powerful modal \\(\\mu\\)-calculus of\nDexter Kozen, which has fixed point operators; see Chapter 5 of\nStirling 2001.\n\nOne interesting feature of these games is that if a player has a\nwinning strategy from some position onwards, then that strategy never\nneeds to refer to anything that happened earlier in the play.\nIt\u2019s irrelevant what choices were made earlier, or even how many\nsteps have been played. So we have what the computer scientists\nsometimes call a \u2018memoryless\u2019 winning strategy. \n\nIn the related \u2018logic of games\u2019, proposed by Rohit Parikh,\ngames that move us between the states are the subject matter rather\nthan a way of giving a truth definition. These games have many\ninteresting aspects. In 2003 the journal Studia Logica ran an\nissue devoted to them, edited by Marc Pauly and Parikh.\n\nInfluences from economics and computer science have led a number of\nlogicians to use logic for analysing decision making under conditions\nof partial ignorance. (See for example the article on\n epistemic logic.)\n There are several ways to represent states of knowledge. One is to\ntake them as states or worlds in the kind of modal structure that we\nmentioned at the beginning of this section. Another is to use IF logic\nor a variant of it. How are these approaches related? Johan van\nBenthem 2006 presents some thoughts and results on this very natural\nquestion. See also the papers by Johan van Benthem, Krister Segerberg,\nEric Pacuit and K. Venkatesh and their references, in Part IV\n\u2018Logic, Agency and Games\u2019 of Van Benthem, Gupta and Parikh\n2011 and the entry on\n logics for analyzing games\n for a sample of recent work in this area.\n",
