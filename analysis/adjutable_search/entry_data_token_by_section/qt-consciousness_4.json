In his monograph on the mathematical foundations of\nquantum mechanics, von Neumann (1955, Chap. V.1) introduced, in an\nad hoc manner, the projection postulate as a mathematical\ntool for describing measurement in terms of a discontinuous,\nnon-causal, instantaneous (irreversible) act given by (1) the\ntransition of a quantum state to an eigenstate bj\nof the measured observable B (with a certain probability).\nThis transition is often called the collapse or\nreduction of the wavefunction, as opposed to (2) the\ncontinuous, unitary (reversible) evolution of a system according to\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nIn Chapter VI, von Neumann (1955) discussed the conceptual distinction\nbetween observed and observing system. In this context, he applied (1)\nand (2) to the general situation of a measured object system (I), a\nmeasuring instrument (II), and (the brain of) a human observer (III).\nHis conclusion was that it makes no difference for the result of\nmeasurements on (I) whether the boundary between observed and\nobserving system is posited between I and (II & III) or between (I\n& II) and III. As a consequence, it is inessential whether a\ndetector or the human brain is ultimately referred to as the\n \u201cobserver\u201d.[7]\n\nBy contrast to von Neumann\u2019s fairly cautious stance, London and\nBauer (1939) went further and proposed that it is indeed human\nconsciousness which completes the quantum measurement process\n(see Jammer (1974, Sec. 11.3 or Shimony (1963) for a detailed\naccount). In this way, they attributed a crucial role to consciousness\nin understanding quantum measurement in terms of an update of the\nobserver\u2019s knowledge. In the 1960s, Wigner (1967) radicalized\nthis\n proposal,[8]\n by suggesting an impact of consciousness on the physical state of the\nmeasured system, not only an impact on observer knowledge. In order to\ndescribe measurement as a real dynamical process generating\nirreversible facts, Wigner called for some nonlinear modification of\n(2) to replace von Neumann\u2019s projection\n (1).[9]\n\nSince the 1980s, Stapp has developed his own point of view on the\nbackground of von Neumann and Wigner. In particular, he tries to\nunderstand specific features of consciousness in relation to quantum\ntheory. Inspired by von Neumann, Stapp uses the freedom to place the\ninterface between observed and observing system and locates it in the\nobserver\u2019s brain. He does not suggest any formal modifications\nto present-day quantum theory (in particular, he stays essentially\nwithin the \u201corthodox\u201d Hilbert space representation), but\nadds major interpretational extensions, in particular with respect to\na detailed ontological framework.\n\nIn his earlier work, Stapp (1993) started with Heisenberg\u2019s\ndistinction between the potential and the actual (Heisenberg 1958),\nthereby taking a decisive step beyond the operational Copenhagen\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics. While Heisenberg\u2019s notion\nof the actual is related to a measured event in the sense of\nthe Copenhagen interpretation, his notion of the potential,\nof a tendency, relates to the situation before\nmeasurement, which expresses the idea of a reality independent of\n measurement.[10]\n\nImmediately after its actualization, each event holds the tendency for\nthe impending actualization of another, subsequent actual event.\nTherefore, events are by definition ambiguous. With respect to their\nactualized aspect, Stapp\u2019s essential move is to \u201cattach to\neach Heisenberg actual event an experiential aspect. The latter is\ncalled the feel of this event, and it can be considered to be\nthe aspect of the actual event that gives it its status as an\nintrinsic actuality\u201d (Stapp 1993, p. 149). \n\nWith respect to their tendency aspect, it is tempting to understand\nevents in terms of\n scheme (B)\n of\n Section 2.\n This is related to Whitehead\u2019s ontology, in which mental and\nphysical poles of so-called \u201cactual occasions\u201d are\nconsidered as psychological and physical aspects of reality. The\npotential antecedents of actual occasions are psychophysically neutral\nand refer to a mode of existence at which mind and matter are\nunseparated. This is expressed, for instance, by Stapp\u2019s notion\nof a \u201chybrid ontology\u201d with \u201cboth idea-like and\nmatter-like qualities\u201d (Stapp 1999, 159). Similarities with a\ndual-aspect approach (B) (cf.\n Section 5)\n are evident.\n\nIn an interview of 2006, Stapp (2006) specifies some ontological\nfeatures of his approach with respect to Whitehead\u2019s process\nthinking, where actual occasions rather than matter or mind are\nfundamental elements of reality. They are conceived as based on a\nprocessual rather than a substantial ontology (see the entry on\n process philosophy).\n Stapp relates the fundamentally processual nature of actual occasions\nto both the physical act of state reduction and the correlated\npsychological intentional act.\n\nAnother significant aspect of his approach is the possibility that\n\u201cconscious intentions of a human being can influence the\nactivities of his brain\u201d (Stapp 1999, p. 153). Different from\nthe possibly misleading notion of a direct interaction, suggesting an\ninterpretation in terms of scheme (A) of\n Section 2,\n he describes this feature in a more subtle manner. The requirement\nthat the mental and material outcomes of an actual occasion must\nmatch, i.e. be correlated, acts as a constraint on the way in which\nthese outcomes are formed within the actual occasion (cf. Stapp 2006).\nThe notion of interaction is thus replaced by the notion of a\nconstraint set by mind-matter correlations (see also Stapp 2007).\n\nAt a level at which conscious mental states and material brain states\nare distinguished, each conscious experience, according to Stapp\n(1999, p. 153), has as its physical counterpart a quantum state\nreduction actualizing \u201cthe pattern of activity that is sometimes\ncalled the neural correlate of that conscious experience\u201d. This\npattern of activity may encode an intention and, thus, represent a\n\u201ctemplate for action\u201d. An intentional decision for an\naction, preceding the action itself, is then the key for anything like\nfree will in this picture.\n\nStapp argues that the mental effort, i.e. attention devoted to such\nintentional acts, can protract the lifetime of the neuronal assemblies\nthat represent the templates for action due to quantum Zeno-type\neffects. Concerning the neurophysiological implementation of this\nidea, intentional mental states are assumed to correspond to\nreductions of superposition states of neuronal assemblies. Additional\ncommentary concerning the concepts of attention and intention in\nrelation to James\u2019 idea of a holistic stream of consciousness\n(James 1950 [1890]) was given by Stapp (1999).\n\nFor further progress, it will be mandatory to develop a coherent\nformal framework for this approach and elaborate on concrete details.\nFor instance, it is not yet worked out precisely how quantum\nsuperpositions and their collapses are supposed to occur in neural\ncorrelates of conscious events. Some indications are outlined by\nSchwartz et al. (2005). With these desiderata for future\nwork, the overall conception is conservative insofar as the physical\nformalism remains unchanged.\n\nThis is why Stapp insisted for years that his approach does not change\nwhat he calls \u201corthodox\u201d quantum mechanics, which is\nessentially encoded in the statistical formulation by von Neumann\n(1955). From the point of view of standard present-day quantum\nphysics, however, it is certainly unorthodox to include the mental\nstate of observers in the theory. Although it is true that quantum\nmeasurement is not yet finally understood in terms of physical theory,\nintroducing mental states as the essential missing link is highly\nspeculative from a contemporary perspective.\n\nThis link is a radical conceptual move. In what Stapp now denotes as a\n\u201csemi-orthodox\u201d approach (Stapp 2015), he proposes that\nthe blind-chance kind of randomness of individual quantum events\n(\u201cnature\u2019s choices\u201d) be reconceived as \u201cnot\nactually random but positively or negatively biased by the positive or\nnegative values in the minds of the observers that are actualized by\nits (nature\u2019s) choices\u201d (p. 187). This hypothesis leads\ninto mental influences on quantum physical processes which are widely\nunknown territory at present. \n",
