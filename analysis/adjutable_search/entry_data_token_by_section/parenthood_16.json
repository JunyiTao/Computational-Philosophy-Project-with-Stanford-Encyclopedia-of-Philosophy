    "main_text": "Becoming Parents || Intentional and voluntarist accounts\n4.3 Intentional and voluntarist accounts\n\nA third approach to parenthood, popular with legal theorists, appeals\nto intentions as the ground of parenthood (Hill 1991; Parker 1982;\nShultz 1990; Stumpf 1986). Intentionalists motivate their position by\nappeal to cases like the following. The Khans wish to have a child\n\u201cof their own.\u201d They screen egg and sperm providers and\nfind providers who satisfy their requirements. They then select a\ngestational mother, who carries the fetus to term and then hands the\ninfant over to the Khans. Intentionalists argue that because they\n\u201ccarefully and intentionally orchestrated the procreational act,\nbringing together all the necessary components with the intention of\ncreating a unique individual whom they intend to raise as their\nown\u201d (Hill 1991, 359), the Khans should be regarded as the\nchild\u2019s sole parents.\n\nAnother argument for intentionalism appeals to the \u201ccase of the\nmisplaced sperm\u201d:\n\n\nBruce is about to undergo some risky medical treatment, and has placed\nsome of his sperm in a sperm-bank in case he needs it at a later date.\nThrough a bureaucratic mishap, Bruce\u2019s sperm is swapped with\nthat of a sperm-donor and is used by Bessie to produce a child. Does\nBruce acquire parental rights and responsibilities over Bessie\u2019s\nchild?\n\n\nIntuitions vary here, but there is at least some pull towards denying\nthat Bruce\u2019s genetic relation to Bessie\u2019s child gives him\nany parental claim over it. The reason Bruce lacks a parental relation\nto Bessie\u2019s child seems to be that he didn\u2019t intentionally\nbring the child into existence.\n\nIntentionalism construes parenthood as relying on facts about agency\nrather than biology; for the intentionalist, parenthood is\nfundamentally a moral relationship rather than a biological one (see\nFuscaldo 2006, for discussion). Some philosophical defenses of\nintentionalism appeal to a voluntaristic account of responsibilities\nin general (Van Zyl 2002). If special obligations to particular others\nare generally acquired voluntarily, then it is plausible that parental\nobligations are also voluntarily incurred (O\u2019Neill 1979; Brake\n2005, 2010; for criticism see Prusak 2011a, b). Furthermore, parental\nobligations are role obligations. While it is a matter of debate\nwhether any role obligations can be acquired involuntarily, it is at\nleast plausible that roles assumed as adults (as opposed to roles one\nis born into) require voluntary acceptance. Finally, parental role\nobligations are conventional: their scope and content varies by\njurisdiction and society. This suggests an unfairness if such\nextensive obligations are incurred involuntarily (Brake 2010). On the\nother hand, once it is recognized that parental obligations are\nconventional, the content of parental obligations and the voluntary\nactions required to acquire them can be explained with reference to\nsocial conventions of parenthood (Millum 2008; 2017). Another defense\nof intentionalism appeals to parental autonomy, as opposed to the way\nin which obligations are incurred: Richards argues for a variant of\nthe intentional view according to which parental rights derive from\n\u201ca right to continue [projects] we have underway\u201d\n(Richards 2010, 23).\n\nOne objection to intentionalism concerns the content of the intentions\nthat are supposed to ground parenthood. Consider a case in which a\ncouple conceives by accident and then form intentions to give up the\nbaby for adoption rather than rear it. This intention endures until 15\nminutes after birth, at which point they change their minds and decide\nto rear the child. It is highly implausible that for the first 15\nminutes of the child\u2019s life they are no more its parents than\nanyone else.\n\nPerhaps the most widespread objection to the voluntarist account is\nthat it seems to absolve unintending procreators from parental\nobligation. However, many share the view that procreators, intending\nor not, who voluntarily engaged in sex have a moral responsibility to\na resulting child due to their role in causing it to exist (Austin\n2007; Fuscaldo 2006; Millum 2008).\n\nWhatever the prospects of a voluntarist account of parenthood, a\nvoluntarist account of familial relations in general is implausible.\nThe duties that siblings have to each other, or that children have to\ntheir parents, are not easily understood as voluntary undertakings.\nThis is a problem for voluntarist accounts of parenthood to the extent\nthat duties between parents and children should fit within a wider\nframework of familial duties (Rachels 1989; Mills 2003; see Mullin\n2010, for discussion; and the entry on\n special obligations).\n",
