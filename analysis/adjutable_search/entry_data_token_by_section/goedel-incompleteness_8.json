    "main_text": "The First Incompleteness Theorem || The First Incompleteness Theorem\u2014Proof Completed\n2.5 The First Incompleteness Theorem\u2014Proof Completed\n\nTo complete the proof, the Diagonalization Lemma is applied to the\nnegated provability predicate\n\\(\\neg\\Prov_F (x)\\): this gives a sentence\n\\(G_F\\) such that\n\n\\[\\tag{G}\nF \\vdash G_F \\leftrightarrow \\neg\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner).\n\\]\n\n\nThus, it can be shown, even inside \\(F\\), that \\(G_F\\) is true if and\nonly if it is not provable in \\(F\\).\n\nIt is not difficult to show that \\(G_F\\) is neither provable nor\ndisprovable in \\(F\\), if \\(F\\) only is 1-consistent. \n\nFor the first half, assume that \\(G_F\\) were provable. Then, by the\nweak representability of provability-in-\\(F\\) by\n\\(\\Prov_F(x)\\), \\(F\\) would also prove \\(\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner\nG_F\\urcorner)\\).  However, because \\(F\\) in fact also proves the\nequivalence (G), i.e, \\(F \\vdash G_F \\leftrightarrow \\neg\\Prov_F\n(\\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\), \\(F\\) would then prove \\(\\neg G_F\\)\ntoo. But this would mean that \\(F\\) is inconsistent. In sum, if \\(F\\)\nis consistent, then \\(G_F\\) is not provable in \\(F\\). For this first\nhalf, the assumption of the simple consistency of \\(F\\) suffices.\n\nFor the second half, it has to be assumed that \\(F\\) is 1-consistent\n(if \\(\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\) has been chosen such that it\nis a \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-sentence; otherwise, the more general assumption\nof \\(\\omega\\)-consistency is needed).\n\nAssume that \\(F \\vdash \\neg G_F\\). Then \\(F\\) cannot prove \\(G_F\\),\nfor otherwise \\(F\\) would be simply inconsistent. Hence no natural\nnumber \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\) is the G\u00f6del number of a proof of\n\\(G_F\\), and because the proof relation is strongly representable, for\nall \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\), \\(F \\vdash \\neg\\Prf_F (\\underline{n},\n\\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\).  If also \\(F \\vdash \\exists x\\Prf_F (x,\n\\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\), \\(F\\) is not 1-consistent, against the\nassumption. Therefore \\(F\\) does not prove \\(\\exists\nx\\Prf_F (x, \\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\), in other words, by the\ndefinition of \\(\\Prov_F (x), F\\) does not prove \\(\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner\nG_F\\urcorner)\\).  By the key equivalence (G), \\(F\\) also does not\nprove \\(\\neg G_F\\).\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s First Incompleteness Theorem\n\nAssume \\(F\\) is a formalized system which contains Robinson\narithmetic Q. Then a sentence \\(G_F\\) of the language of \\(F\\)\ncan be mechanically constructed from \\(F\\) such that:\n\nIf \\(F\\) is consistent, then \\(F \\not\\vdash G_F\\).\nIf \\(F\\) is 1-consistent, then \\(F \\not\\vdash \\neg G_F\\)\n\n\n\nSuch an independent, or \u201cundecidable\u201d (that is, neither\nprovable nor refutable in \\(F)\\) statement \\(G_F\\) in \\(F\\) is often\ncalled \u201cthe G\u00f6del sentence\u201d of \\(F\\).\n\nIn fact, in favourable circumstances, it can be shown that \\(G_F\\) is\ntrue, provided that \\(F\\) is indeed consistent. This is the case if,\nfor example, the provability predicate \\(\\Prov_F (x)\\) has been chosen\nas a \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-formula: The G\u00f6del sentence is then\nprovably equivalent to the universal formula \\(\\forall x\\neg\\Prf_F (x,\n\\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\).  Such formulas can be proved false whenever\nthey in fact are false: if false, there would be a number\n\\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\) such that \\(F \\vdash\\Prf_F (\\underline{n},\n\\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\) (this holds already in Q). This,\nhowever, would contradict the incompleteness theorem. Therefore,\n\\(G_F\\) cannot be false, and must be true. For this reason, the\nG\u00f6del sentence is often called \u201ctrue but\nunprovable\u201d.\n\nOne should not get confused here: \u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s\ntheorem\u201d is the general incompleteness result of G\u00f6del\nwhich concerns a large class of formal systems, while the\n\u201cG\u00f6del sentence\u201d is the constructed, formally\nundecidable sentence which varies from one formal system to another.\nThis is why it is important to include the subscript \\(F\\) in\n\\(G_F\\). Furthermore, one should not confuse the\ntwo different senses of \u201cundecidable\u201d in this context. On\nthe one hand, a particular sentence, like the G\u00f6del\nsentence, may be undecidable in the sense of being independent, i.e.,\nneither provable not refutable in a chosen system. On the other hand,\na theory may be undecidable (see below) in the sense that there\ndoes not exist a decision method for determining of an arbitrary given\nsentence of the language whether or not it is derivable in the theory\n(so this latter sense of \u201cundecidable\u201d concerns, so to\nspeak, an infinite class of statements).\n\nIn informal explanations of the first incompleteness theorem, it is\noften said that the G\u00f6del sentence \\(G_F\\)\n\u201csays of itself that it is not provable\u201d. Such imprecise\nstatements, however, should be taken at least with a grain of salt.\nThere are a number of reasons to conclude that, at least in general,\nG\u00f6del sentences do not really say anything substantial about\nthemselves (Milne 2007 is a careful analysis of such issues); for\nexample, as was previously noted in the case of the Diagonalization\nLemma, one is usually operating here with mere material\nequivalences.\nRosser\u2019s Improvement\u2014From \\(\\omega\\)-consistency to Consistency\n\nIn 1936, J. Barkley Rosser made an important improvement that allows\none to get rid of the somewhat clumsy assumption of\n\\(\\omega\\)-consistency in the proof of G\u00f6del\u2019s\nfirst theorem. For this purpose, Rosser introduced a new,\nsomewhat artificial \u201cprovability predicate\u201d\n\\(\\Prov^*(x)\\) which was constructed, informally, as\nfollows:\n\nThere exists \\(y\\) such that \\(y\\) is the G\u00f6del number of a\nproof of the formula with G\u00f6del number \\(x\\), AND there\ndoes not exist \\(z\\) smaller than \\(y\\) such that \\(z\\) is the\nG\u00f6del number of a proof the negation of the formula with\nG\u00f6del number \\(x\\).\n\nMore formally:\n\n\\[\n\\Prov^*(x) =_{\\textit{def}} \\exists y[\\Prf_F (y, x)\n\\wedge \\forall z \\lt y(\\neg\\Prf_F (z, \\textit{neg}(x)))],\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\Prf_F (y, x)\\) is the more\nstandard proof relation discussed earlier.\n\nAs it happens, if the formal system \\(F\\) under consideration is\nindeed consistent, Rosser\u2019s provability predicate is\nco-extensional with the ordinary provability predicate. Applying the\nDiagonalization Lemma to the negation of Rosser\u2019s provability\npredicate \\(\\Prov^*(x)\\) gives:\n\nRosser\u2019s modification of the first theorem (Rosser\n1936)\n\nLet \\(F\\) be consistent formalized system which contains\nQ. Then there is a sentence \\(R_F\\) of the language of \\(F\\)\nsuch that neither \\(R_F\\) nor \\(\\neg R_F\\) is provable in \\(F\\).\n\n",
