    "main_text": "Overview: Basic Issues, Questions, and Distinctions || Three Kinds of Appeal to Evolution in Evolutionary Ethics\n1.1 Three Kinds of Appeal to Evolution in Evolutionary Ethics\n\nTalk of \u2018evolutionary ethics\u2019 may suggest a well-defined\nfield of inquiry, but in practice it can refer to any or all of the\nfollowing:\n\nDescriptive Evolutionary Ethics: appeals to evolutionary\ntheory in the scientific explanation of the origins of certain human\ncapacities, tendencies, or patterns of thought, feeling and behavior.\nFor example: the appeal to natural selection pressures in the distant\npast to explain the evolution of a capacity for normative guidance, or\nmore specifically the origins of our sense of fairness or our\nresentment of cheaters. (See section 2.)\nPrescriptive Evolutionary Ethics: appeals to evolutionary\ntheory in justifying or undermining certain normative ethical claims\nor theories\u2014for example, to justify free market capitalism or\nmale-dominant social structures, or to undermine the claim that human\nbeings have a special dignity that non-human animals lack. (See\nsection 3.)\nEvolutionary Metaethics: appeals to evolutionary theory\nin supporting or undermining various\n metaethical\n theories (i.e., theories about moral discourse and its\nsubject matter)\u2014for example, to support a non-cognitivist\naccount of the semantics of moral judgment (the idea that moral\njudgments do not purport to represent moral facts but instead just\nexpress emotions, attitudes or commitments), or to undermine the claim\nthat there are objective moral values, or to cast doubt on whether we\ncould have justified beliefs about such values. (See section 4.)\n\n\nAll three types of project have broadly to do with how\nneo-Darwinian evolutionary theory might bear on our understanding of\nethics or morality. The driving questions, concerns,\nmethodologies and implications, however, differ greatly among these\nthree lines of inquiry.\n\nImportantly, there are no simple or straightforward moves from the\nscientific projects in A to the philosophical projects in B or C.\nArguments for or against such moves require difficult philosophical\nwork. Moreover, philosophical issues relevant to C can have an\nimportant bearing on at least some of the scientific explanatory\nprojects in A. This puts important constraints on how much can\nconfidently be said in favor of such scientific explanations given\nongoing controversy over the philosophical issues.\n\nIt is, for example, a matter of live debate in contemporary metaethics\nwhether there are knowable moral truths\u2014correct answers\nto at least some questions about what is morally good or bad, right or\nwrong. If there are, as many philosophers (and non-philosophers)\nbelieve, then this will likely make a difference to the explanation of\nat least some of our moral beliefs and behaviors. Our belief\nin equal human dignity, for example, along with derivative beliefs\nabout the wrongness of slavery or rape, might be sufficiently\nexplained by our having grasped the moral truth that human beings have\nsuch dignity and so should not be treated as \u201cmere means\u201d\n(see section 2.4). Similarly, the belief that we have moral\nobligations to mitigate suffering even among distant strangers might\nbe explained at least in part by our having grasped the moral fact\nthat pointless suffering is intrinsically bad and that this gives us\ngood reason to mitigate it where we can.\n\nIf this is so, then scientists will be overreaching if they claim that\n\u201ccausal explanations of brain activity and\nevolution\u2026already cover most known facts about behavior we term\n\u2018moral\u2019\u201d (Wilson 1998, 54). Instead, a significant\namount of moral judgment and behavior may be the result of gaining\nmoral knowledge, rather than just reflecting the causal conditioning\nof evolution. This might apply even to universally held moral\nbeliefs or distinctions, which are often cited as evidence of an\nevolved \u201cuniversal moral grammar\u201d (Mikhail 2011). For\nexample, people everywhere and from a very young age distinguish\nbetween violations of merely conventional norms and\nviolations of norms involving harm, and they are strongly\ndisposed to respond to suffering with concern (Nichols 2004). But even\nif this partly reflects evolved psychological mechanisms or\n\u2018modules\u2019 governing social sentiments and responses, much\nof it may also be the result of human intelligence grasping\n(under varying cultural conditions) genuine morally relevant\ndistinctions or facts\u2014such as the difference between the\nnormative force that attends harm and that which attends mere\nviolations of convention.\n\nWe will look in more detail later at this and other possibilities for\nexplaining moral judgment and behavior. The point so far is just that\nthere are plausible philosophical accounts of at least some moral\njudgment and behavior that appeal to independent exercises of\njudgment\u2014perhaps in grasping moral truths, or perhaps just in\nforming reflective commitments\u2014rather than to causal\nconditioning by evolutionary factors. There is a danger, then, of\nbegging central questions if we draw general conclusions\nabout \u201cthe\u201d explanation of \u201cour\u201d moral thought\nand behavior based on scientific considerations\u2014as is common in\ndiscussions of scientific work in this area. We may instead need a\nplurality of explanatory models. The best explanation for deeply\nreflective moral judgments may look quite different from the\nexplanation for unreflective psychological dispositions we share with\nother primates, and there may be mixed explanations for much that lies\nin between.\n",
