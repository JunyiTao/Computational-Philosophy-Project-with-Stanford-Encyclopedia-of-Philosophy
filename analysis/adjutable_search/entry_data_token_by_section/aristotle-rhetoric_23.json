This topic was not\nannounced until the final passage of Rhetoric II, so that\nmost scholars have come to think of this section as a more or less\nself-contained treatise. The insertion of this treatise into the\nRhetoric is motivated by the claim that, while\nRhetoric I & II dealt with thought (dianoia), i.e., about\nwhat the orator should say, it remains to inquire into the\nvarious ways of saying or formulating one and the same thing. In the\ncourse of Rhetoric III.1\u201312 it turns out that Aristotle\ntackles this task by using some quite heterogeneous approaches. After\nan initial exploration of the field of delivery and style (III.1)\nAristotle tries to determine what good prose style consists in; for\nthis purpose he has to go into the differentiation and the selection\nof various kinds of nouns, one of which is defined as metaphor\n(III.2). The following chapters III.3\u20136 feature topics that are\nat best loosely connected with the theme of good prose style; among\nthese topics is the opposite of good style, namely frigid or deterring\nstyle (psuchron) (III.3), the simile, which turns out to be\nconnected with the metaphor (III.4), the issue of correct Greek\n(III.5), the appropriateness (III.7) and the means by which\none\u2019s style becomes long-winded and dignified (III.6). Chapters\nIII.8\u20139 introduce two new approaches to the issue of style,\nwhich seem to be unrelated to everything that has been said so far:\nThese are the topics of the rhythmical shaping of prose style and of\nperiodic and non-periodic flow of speech. Chapters III.10\u201311 are\ndedicated to how the orator can \u2018bring things before one\u2019s\neyes\u2019, which amounts to something like making the style more\nvivid. Again metaphors are shown to play a crucial role for that\npurpose, so that the topic of metaphor is taken up again and deepened\nby extended lists of examples. Chapter III.12 seems to make a new\nstart by distinguishing between oral and written style and assessing\ntheir suitability for the three genres of speech (see above\n \u00a72).\n The philosophical core of Aristotle\u2019s treatise on style in\nRhetoric III.1\u201312 seems to be included in the\ndiscussion of the good prose style (see below\n \u00a78.1),\n however it is the topic of metaphor (see below\n \u00a78.2)\n that has attracted the most attention in the later reception up to\nthe present day.\n",
