Later Developments in Antiquity\nAt a time when the considered wisdom of Greece and Rome came under\nincreasing pressure to re-articulate its commitments in the face of\nwaves of novel movements that lay claim to revelatory truth, the\nNeoplatonists too strove to refine their teachings and to delineate\nthe metaphysical architecture of the world as they saw it. No longer\nwould it suffice to hold forth on philosophical issues, as Plato,\nCicero, and to some extent Plotinus had done, in a serious yet\nexploratory and protreptic spirit. In order to be heard in an\nincreasingly competitive marketplace of ideas teeming with holy men of\nevery kind and temperament, views had to be laid out clearly and in\nsystematic fashion. In some of its later manifestations, like Stoicism\nand Epicureanism before it, Neoplatonism drifted towards scholasticism\nand reveled in dogmatic system building.\nAlong the way, all kinds of refinements and modifications of\nnomenclature were introduced. Distinctions were drawn up within the\nhypostases of Consciousness and Soul in order to try to articulate the\ntransitions from one level of Being to another. An entire industry of\nteaching and commenting sprang up to interpret a millennium of\nHellenic philosophy in the light of the core commitments of\nNeoplatonism.  Certain philosophic predecessors were elevated to the\nstatus of nearly infallible authorities, and the texts of Plato and\nAristotle were comprehensively read, diligently analyzed, and\nruthlessly harmonized.  Finally, in an effort to stem the rising tide\nof all kinds of new salvation-peddling cults then inundating the Roman\nEmpire, the ancient religious traditions of the Greeks and especially\nthe Egyptians were brought into the fold and given new significance\nand meaning. But after the untimely death of Emperor Julian (363), a\nNeoplatonist himself, none of these efforts could any longer withstand\nthe tidal wave of Christendom.\nThe most vigorous group of Neoplatonists, living in Athens and\nstill adhering to the old rituals, disbanded in the aftermath of\nEmperor Justinian\u2019s legislation of 529, which resulted in the\nclosing of the Platonist academy. Hellenic philosophy and the teaching\nof its attendant disciplines went on in Alexandria and Constantinople\nuntil the end of the 6th century, but were now being taught\nby people who had either embraced or otherwise come to terms with the\nnew religion. The Arab conquest in the 7th century\nobliterated and appropriated in equal measure, but the real revival of\nNeoplatonism occurred when humanists made the treasures of late\nantique Greece available to the Renaissance intelligentsia of Italy,\nFrance, and Germany.\n",
