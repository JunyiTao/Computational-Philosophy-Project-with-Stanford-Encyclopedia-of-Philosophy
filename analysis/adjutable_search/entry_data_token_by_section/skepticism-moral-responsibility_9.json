    "main_text": "Implications of Moral Responsibility Skepticism || Reactive Attitudes\n3.2 Reactive Attitudes\n\nOne concern people have with moral responsibility skepticism is that\nit would threaten our personal relationships and the fulfillment in\nlife that they provide. P.F. Strawson (1962) famously argued that our\njustification for claims of blameworthiness and praiseworthiness is\ngrounded in the system of human reactive attitudes, such as\nmoral resentment, indignation, guilt, and\ngratitude. Strawson contends that because our moral\nresponsibility practices are grounded in this way, the truth or\nfalsity of causal determinism is not relevant to whether we\njustifiably hold each other and ourselves morally responsible.\nMoreover, if causal determinism were true and did threaten these\nattitudes, as some moral responsibility skeptics are apt to maintain,\nwe would face instead the prospect of the cold and calculating\nobjective attitude, a stance that relinquishes the reactive\nattitudes and treats individuals as objects to be manipulated and\nfixed for consequentialist ends. Strawson argues that adopting the\nobjective attitude would rule out the possibility of the meaningful\nsorts of personal relationships we value (see also Wolf 1981, 1990).\nSummarizing the Strawsonian concern, then, we can say that adopting\nglobal skepticism about moral responsibility, assuming it was\npsychologically possible, would undermine expressions of our\ninter-personal reactive attitudes essential to good personal\nrelationships, and would jeopardize our intra-personal reactive\nattitudes such as guilt and repentance, which are\ncrucial to personal moral development.\n\nMoral responsibility skeptics generally respond to this Strawsonian\nconcern in two ways. One response argues that, contra Strawson, it\nis possible to adopt the objective attitude in a way that\nrespects persons and does not hinder our personal relationships\n(Sommers 2007a). The second and more common response acknowledges that\nStrawson may be right about the objective attitude, but denies that\nskepticism about moral responsibility requires us to reject all the\nreactive attitudes (Pereboom 1995, 2001, 2014a; Waller 1990, 2006, 2011; Milam\n2016). This latter approach maintains that the attitudes we most want to retain either are not\nundermined by moral responsibility skepticism because they do not have\npresuppositions that conflict with this view, or else they have\nalternatives that are not under threat. And what remains does not\namount to Strawson\u2019s objectivity of attitude and is sufficient\nto sustain the personal relationships we value.\n\nPerhaps no one has done more to develop this second line of reply than\nDerk Pereboom (see 1995, 2001, 2002a,b, 2009, 2012, 2013a, 2014a). He\nargues, for instance, that while certain kinds of moral anger, such as\nresentment and indignation, would be undercut if\nmoral responsibility skepticism is true, these attitudes are\nsuboptimal relative to alternative attitudes available to us, such as\nmoral concern, disappointment, sorrow, and\nresolve. The expression of these replacement attitudes can\nconvey the same relevant information as moral anger but in a way that\nis less harmful and consistent with the denial of basic desert moral\nresponsibility. Expression of resentment and indignation \u201coften\nfails to contribute to the well being of those whom it is\ndirected\u201d and is \u201capt to have harmful effects\u201d\n(Pereboom 2014a: 180). Moral anger frequently is intended to cause\nphysical or emotional pain, and can give rise to \u201cdestructive\nresistance instead of reconciliation\u201d (Pereboom 2014a: 180). As\na result it has the potential to damage or destroy relationships. It\nalso often leads to excessively punitive and counterproductive social\npractices and policies (see Waller 2011, 2014; Carey & Paulhus\n2013; Nadelhoffer & Tocchetto 2013; Shariff et al. 2014). [For\nadditional arguments against moral anger and the benefits of\nrelinquishing it, see Flanagan (2016) and Nussbaum (2016).] \n\nGuilt also appears to be one of the reactive attitudes\nimperiled by moral responsibility skepticism since it involves the\nsupposition that one is blameworthy in the basic desert sense for an\nimmoral action one has performed. Strawsonians fear that absent guilt\nwe would not be motivated to moral improvement after acting badly, and\nwe would be kept from reconciliation in impaired relationships.\nFurthermore, because guilt is undermined by the skeptical view,\nrepentance is also ruled out, because feeling guilty is a\nprerequisite for a repentant attitude. It is unclear, though, whether\nguilt is really needed to perform the functions mentioned above.\nSuppose instead of guilt an agent acknowledges that she has acted\nimmorally and she feels deep sorrow for what she has done, and as a\nresult she is motivated to eradicate her disposition to behave in this\nbad way (see Waller 1990: 165\u201366). Such a reaction, skeptics\ncontend, can secure the good that guilt can also secure, and it is\nwholly compatible with the skeptical perspective (see Pereboom 2001,\n2014a; Waller 1990; cf. Bok 1998). Furthermore, since self-guilt can\noften be crippling and counterproductive for moral development, an\napproach that avoids guilt may actually be more successful in bring\nabout the desired change in agents (Sommers 2007a). \n\nAnother reactive attitude that some think would be threatened by moral\nresponsibility skepticism is gratitude. Gratitude arguably\npresupposes that the person to whom one is grateful is praiseworthy in\nthe basic desert sense for a beneficial act (cf. Honderich 1988:\n518\u201319). But even if this is so, certain aspects of gratitude\nwould not be undercut, and these aspects would seem to provide what is\nrequired for the personal relationships we value (Pereboom 2001,\n2014a; Sommers 2007a). Gratitude involves being thankful toward the\nperson who has acted beneficially. This aspect of gratitude is in the\nclear\u2014e.g., one can be thankful to a young child for some\nkindness without supposing that she is praiseworthy in the basic\ndesert sense. And while gratitude also often involves joy as a\nresponse to what someone has done, skepticism about moral\nresponsibility does not yield a challenge to being joyful and\nexpressing joy when others act beneficially, so this too is in the\nclear.\n\nOf course, some of the recommended transformations in emotional\nattitudes may not be possible for us. In certain situations refraining\nfrom resentment or moral anger may be beyond our power, and thus even\nthe committed skeptic might not be able to make the change the\nskeptical view suggests. Yet, a committed skeptic need not eliminate\nthese attitudes completely to accept the conclusion that agents are\nnever deserving of praise and blame, she must attempt instead not to\nengage or entertain them (Sommers 2007a: 328;\nRussell 1992: 296). Shaun Nichols (2007), for example, invokes the\ndistinction between narrow-profile emotional responses, e.g.,\nlocal or immediate emotional reactions to situations, and\nwide-profile responses, which are not immediate and involve\nrational reflection (see also Pereboom 2014a). We might expect to be\nunable to appreciably reduce narrow-profile moral anger as an\nimmediate reaction upon being deeply hurt in an intimate personal\nrelationship. In wide-profile cases, however, diminishing or even\neliminating moral anger is open\u2014or, at least, we can disavow it\nin the sense of rejecting any force it may be assumed to have in\njustifying a harmful response to wrongdoing. This\nmodification of moral anger, skeptics contend, might well be\nadvantageous for our valuable personal relationships, and it has the\npotential to bring about the equanimity that Spinoza (1677 [1985])\nthought skepticism about free will and moral responsibility, more\ngenerally, would secure (see Pereboom 2001, 2014a; cf. Russell\n2004).\n",
