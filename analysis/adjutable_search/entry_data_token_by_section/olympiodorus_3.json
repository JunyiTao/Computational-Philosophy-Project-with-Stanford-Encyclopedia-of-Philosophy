    "main_text": "Olympiodorus the Alchemist\n4. Olympiodorus the Alchemist\n\n\nDiscussion of the commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Meteorology (with\nthe co-called \u201cchemical treatise\u201d as its fourth book)\nprompts the question of the identity of the Neoplatonist Olympiodorus\nwith another figure carrying precisely the same name who appears in\nthe alchemist tradition. Four extant manuscripts of an alchemical work\nthat purports to be a commentary on Zosimus\u2019 Kat\u2019\nenergeian (On Activity) state that the piece was written\nby \u201cOlympiodorus, the Alexandrian philosopher\u201d (see\n\u00a76 below). The alchemical treatise starts out as a commentary on\nZosimus (of Panopolis, not the 5th c. C.E. historian),\nexplaining a small passage in some detail, but then continues in the\nvein of a didactic letter written to an unnamed fellow alchemist\n(called \u2018friend of the Muses\u2019 at one point); it\n\u2018explains\u2019 how to join scattered parts of gold and purify\nmetals, emphasizes the significance of \u2018divine water\u2019\n(whatever that is) and so on and so forth. The author knows a smidgen\nabout the Presocratics (whom he regards as alchemists), but next to\nnothing about Plato and Aristotle; instead, he can quote at length\nfrom Zosimus, Hermes, Petasius, Pelagius, and a \u201cdivine\nMary\u201d \u2014 not the mother of Jesus but a Jewish sage\nelsewhere attested in the alchemist tradition.\n\n\nA closer survey of the text quickly reveals that scholars like H.D.\nSaffrey 2005 are right to suppose that the alchemical treatise cannot\nhave been produced by the Neoplatonist philosopher. For one thing,\nunlike the philosopher, the alchemist seems to be a Christian,\nattributing a saying by Paul (\u201cThe letter kills, but the spirit\ngives life.\u201d 2 Cor. 3.6) to \u201cthe Lord\u201d (94,\n13\u201315). In addition, contents, style, diction, as well as the\nwhole rhetorical ambience created by the two authors are strikingly\ndifferent. C. Viano 2006, who once defended the identity of the two\nfigures and who still detects some similarities in language between\nthe alchemical treatise and the commentary on Book IV of Aristotle\u2019s\nMeteorology, now proposes that the author of the alchemical\ntreatise may have used Olympiodorus\u2019 Meteorology commentary,\nor another, more alchemical (rather than philosophical) work; the\nalchemist\u2019s manuscripts would then be testimony to the influence of\nOlympiodorus.\n\n\nIn any case, we can be quite sure that the Neoplatonist Olympiodorus\ndid not write this piece of alchemy. Nevertheless, it seems\nto be clearly he whom the manuscripts refer to as the work\u2019s\nauthor. Since pseudepigraphy is one of the defining characteristics of\nthe genre of alchemist literature, it seems safe to assume that the\ncommentary on Zosimus is a false attribution. There never was another\nAlexandrian named Olympiodorus whose expertise was alchemy rather than\nPlatonic philosophy.\n",
