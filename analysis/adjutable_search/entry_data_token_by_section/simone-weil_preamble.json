    "main_text": "\n\nSimone Weil (1909\u20131943) philosophized on thresholds and across\nborders. Her persistent desire for truth and justice led her to both\nelite academies and factory floors, political praxis and spiritual\nsolitude. At different times she was an activist, a pacifist, a\nmilitant, a mystic, and an exile; but throughout, in her inquiry into\nreality and orientation to the good, she remained a philosopher. Her\noeuvre features deliberate contradiction yet demonstrates remarkable\nclarity. It is value centered and integrated but not systematic. It\ncontains scattered notes of her translations of and commentaries on\nseveral ancient Greek texts, Pythagorean geometry formulae, and\ndetailed accounts of her daily tasks within a factory; but her oeuvre\nis also composed of addresses to political, industrial, and religious\nleaders as well as pieces intended for university students, radical\nmilitants, industrial workers, and farm laborers. In both her life and\nher thought\u2014itself an unstable distinction with respect to\nWeil\u2014she is a philosopher of margins and paradoxes. In part\nbecause Weil\u2019s thought defies categorization, the ways in which\nher ideas are taken up often say as much about her commentator as they\ndo about her. She was taken as a prototype for Albert Camus\u2019s\nr\u00e9volt\u00e9s and praised by Andr\u00e9 Gide as\n\u201cthe patron saint of all outsiders\u201d. Giorgio Agamben\ndescribed her conscience as \u201cthe most lucid of our times\u201d,\nand Hannah Arendt claimed that perhaps only Weil treated the subject\nof labor \u201cwithout prejudice and sentimentality\u201d. Maurice\nBlanchot described Weil as an \u201cexceptional figure\u201d who\noffers \u201can example of certitude\u201d in the modern world, and\nIris Murdoch wrote of \u201ca profoundly disciplined life behind her\nwritings\u201d that gave \u201can authority which cannot be\nimitated\u201d. But Weil was also criticized by Leon Trotsky as a\n\u201cmelancholy revolutionary\u201d and disparaged as\n\u201ccrazy\u201d by Charles de Gaulle. These remarks, however,\nbetray an irony of which Weil was well aware and about which she was\ndeeply concerned near the end of her life, namely, that her person\nwould be considered more than her thought. By categorically focusing\non the philosophical concepts Weil articulated and developed, this\nentry presents her philosophy while speaking to her concern.\n\nFollowing Weil\u2019s philosophical development, her central concepts\nare addressed under five categories: social-political philosophy,\nepistemology, ethics, metaphysical and religious philosophy, and\naesthetics. The periodization employed is as follows: 1925\u20131934\n(early), 1935\u20131939 (middle), 1939\u20131943 (late). It is\nimportant to note that, given Weil\u2019s rejection of systematicity\nand development of concepts, these categories and periods introduce a\ndegree of artifice into her thought. The conclusion of this entry\nreports on her reception among the Continental and Anglo-American\ntraditions of philosophy.\n",
