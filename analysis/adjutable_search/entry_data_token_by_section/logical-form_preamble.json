Examples like (1\u20133) illustrate\nreasoning that cannot lead from true premises to false\nconclusions.\n\n(1)\nJohn danced if Mary sang, and Mary sang; so John\ndanced.\n(2)\nEvery politician is deceitful, and every senator is\na politician; so every senator is deceitful.\n(3)\nThe detective is in the garden; so someone is in\nthe garden.\n\n\nIn such cases, a thinker takes no epistemic risk by endorsing the\nconditional claim that the conclusion is true if the\npremises are true. The conclusion follows from the premises, without\nany further assumptions that might turn out to be false. Any risk of\nerror lies with the premises, as opposed to the reasoning. By\ncontrast, examples like (4\u20136) illustrate reasoning that involves\nat least some risk of going wrong\u2014from correct premises to a\nmistaken conclusion.\n\n(4)\nJohn danced if Mary sang, and John danced; so Mary\nsang.\n(5)\nEvery feathered biped is a bird, and Tweety is a\nfeathered biped; so Tweety can fly.\n(6)\nEvery human born before 1879 died; so every human\nwill die.\n\n\nInference (4) is not secure. John might dance whenever Mary sings, but\nalso sometimes when Mary doesn\u2019t sing. Similarly, with regard to\n(5), Tweety might be a bird that cannot fly. Even (6) falls short of\nthe demonstrative character exhibited by (1\u20133). While laws of\nnature may preclude immortality, the conclusion of (6) goes beyond its\npremise, even if it is foolish to resist the inference.\n\nAppeals to logical form arose in the context of attempts to say more\nabout this intuitive distinction between impeccable inferences, which\ninvite metaphors of security, and inferences that involve some risk of\nslipping from truth to falsity. The idea is that some inferences, like\n(1\u20133), are structured in a way that confines any risk\nof error to the premises. The motivations for developing this idea\nwere both practical and theoretical. Experience teaches us that an\ninference can initially seem more secure than it is; and if we knew\nwhich forms of inference are risk-free, that might help us\navoid errors. As we\u2019ll see, claims about inference are also\nintimately connected with claims about the nature of thought and its\nrelation to language.\n\nMany philosophers have been especially interested in the possibility\nthat grammar masks the underlying structure of thought,\nperhaps in ways that invite mistaken views about how ordinary language\nis related to cognition and the world we talk about. For example,\nsimilarities across sentences like \u2018Homer talked\u2019,\n\u2018Nobody talked\u2019, and \u2018The nymph talked\u2019\ninitially suggest that the corresponding thoughts exhibit a common\nsubject-predicate form. But even if \u2018Homer\u2019 indicates an\nentity that can be the subject of a thought that is true if and only\nif the entity in question talked, \u2018Nobody\u2019 does not; and\nas we\u2019ll see, \u2018The\u2019 is complicated. Philosophers and\nlinguists have also asked general questions about how logic is related\nto grammar. Do thoughts and sentences exhibit different kinds\nof structure? Do sentences exhibit grammatical structures\nthat are not obvious? And if the logical structure of a thought can\ndiverge from the grammatical structure of a sentence that is used to\nexpress the thought, how should we construe proposals about the\nlogical forms of inferences like (1)\u2013(6)? Are such proposals\nnormative claims about how we ought to think/talk, or empirical\nhypotheses about aspects of psychological/linguistic reality?\n\nProposed answers to these questions are usually interwoven with claims\nabout why various inferences seem compelling. So it would be nice to\nknow which inferences really are secure, and in virtue of what these\ninferences are special. The most common suggestion has been that\ncertain inferences are secure by virtue of their logical form. Though\nunsurprisingly, conceptions of form have evolved along with\nconceptions of logic and language.\n",
