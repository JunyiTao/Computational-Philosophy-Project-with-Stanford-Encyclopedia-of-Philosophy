Methodology in Philosophy of Biology and Future Directions\n\nMost work in the philosophy of biology is self-consciously\nnaturalistic, recognizing no profound discontinuity in either method\nor content between philosophy and science. Ideally, philosophy of\nbiology differs from biology itself not in its knowledge base, but\nonly in the questions it asks. The philosopher aims to engage with the\ncontent of biology at a professional level, although typically with\ngreater knowledge of its history than biologists themselves, and fewer\nhands-on skills. It is common for philosophers of biology to have\nacademic credentials in the fields that are the focus of their\nresearch, and to be closely involved with scientific collaborators.\nPhilosophy of biology\u2019s naturalism and the continuity of its concerns\nwith science itself is shared with much other recent work in the\nphilosophy of science, perhaps most notably in the philosophy of\nneuroscience (Bechtel, Mandik et al. 2001).\n\nEven the distinction between the questions of biology and\nthose of philosophy of biology is not absolutely clear. As noted\nabove, philosophers of biology address three types of questions:\ngeneral questions about the nature of science, conceptual problems\nwithin biology, and traditional philosophical questions that seem open\nto illumination from the biosciences. When addressing the second sort\nof question, there is no clear distinction between philosophy of\nbiology and theoretical biology. But while this can lead to the\naccusation that philosophers of biology have abandoned their calling\nfor \u2018science reporting\u2019 it can equally well be said that a\nbook like The Selfish Gene (Dawkins 1976) is primarily a\ncontribution to philosophical discussion of biology. Certainly, the\nprofessional skills of the philosopher are as relevant to these\ninternal conceptual puzzles as they are to the other two types of\nquestion. All three types of question can be related to the specific\nfindings of the biological sciences only by complex chains of\nargument.\n\nThere is a great deal of new work being in done in the philosophy of\nbiology. As examples, there is a rich philosophical literature\nemerging around cancer (Plutynski 2018), cultural evolution (Sterelny\n2012; Lewens 2015; O\u2019Connor 2019), human nature (Machery 2008;\nRamsey 2013; Kronfeldner 2018), microbiology (O\u2019Malley 2014),\nand paleobiology (Turner 2011; Currie 2018). Philosophy of biology\nstill remains one of the most dynamic and interesting areas of the\nphilosophy of science and philosophy more generally. \n",
