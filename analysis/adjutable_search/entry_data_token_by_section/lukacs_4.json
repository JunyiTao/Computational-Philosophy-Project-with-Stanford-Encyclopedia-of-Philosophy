    "main_text": "Early Writings || Modernity and the Loss of Totality\n2.3 Modernity and the Loss of Totality\n\nAnother aspect of Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s early work concerns the historical\nchanges undergone by our relation to form. In his early analysis of\nthe history and sociology of drama (History of the Modern\nDrama, 1909), Luk\u00e1cs develops an account of the connection\nbetween aesthetic genres and historical changes. He argues that drama\nis connected to specific historical circumstances: for drama to exist,\nthere needs to be a prevailing Weltanschauung (GW\n15: 44) that seeks drama as its preferred mode of expression. This\ntragic Weltanschauung only exists in periods of societal\ndisintegration, when individual emotions and objective facts are so\nmismatched as to elicit heroic forms of denial of social reality.\n\nIn The Theory of the Novel (1916), Luk\u00e1cs turns\ntowards the philosophy of history in order to clarify the relationship\nbetween the historical changes undergone by transcendental standpoints\nand the \u201cpure forms\u201d of aesthetic genres. The primary\nobject of his discussion is the epic: Luk\u00e1cs claims that works\nof art that belong to this genre\u2014for example Homeric epic poetry\nand the modern novel\u2014must always express the objective reality\nof social and individual human life as it is (1916: 46).\nHowever, because of the distinctive \u201cmetaphysical\nconditions\u201d of different epochs, they express this objective\nreality in radically different ways. Homeric epic poetry takes as its\nstarting point a world that constitutes a closed totality\n(1916: 33), that is, a world in which life, culture, meaning, actions,\nand social institutions form a harmonious whole. In particular,\nLuk\u00e1cs claims that in Ancient Greece the \u201cessence\u201d\nof being was immanent to life rather than having to be sought out in a\ntranscendent realm. Furthermore, there was no gap between individual\nconsciousness and objectified meaning in the world that would have\nrequired the individual to project meaning onto the world. Individuals\nin Ancient Greece only had to accept the totality of meaning within\ntheir world, even if they were, in some particular situation or\nanother, unable to understand it. By contrast, modern society is\nconstitutively alienated: merely conventional social institutions\ndevoid of meaning are disconnected from individuals and their highly\nindividualized self-understandings. Therefore, in modern society\nmeaning can only be found within the inner life of the individual\n(1916: 61).\n\nStarting from this description of a closed totality, Luk\u00e1cs\nclaims that the intellectual history of the modern world was\nprefigured in the cultural history of Ancient Greece, in the movement\nfrom epic poetry to tragedy and then ultimately to philosophy. In the\ncourse of this movement, the sources of meaning became increasingly\nmore external to immediate life. As a consequence, Luk\u00e1cs\nargues that these three genres inhabit three different\n\u201ctranscendental loci\u201d (1916: 36). Tragedy and\nphilosophy reflect the loss of a meaningful totality, whereas the\npossibility of epic poetry depends on its immanence. As Luk\u00e1cs\nclaims, this is why \u201cart forms become subject to a\nhistorico-philosophical dialectic\u201d (1916: 39).\n\nThe cause of this development is a loss of totality through historical\nchanges that transform the objective institutions of social life into\nmere conventions and into a purely external \u201csecond\nnature\u201d (1916: 62f., 112). This alienation of the individual\nfrom the world leads to a situation of \u201ctranscendental\nhomelessness\u201d (1916: 40, 60) in which individuals must take up a\npurely normative \u201cshould be\u201d (1916: 47) stance toward the\nworld. The novel is always related to the development of such\nindividuals. This development can take the form of a\nsubjective-idealist illusion (e.g., as in Don Quixote) or of\na disillusion, that is, of individuals understanding the impossibility\nof finding meaning in the world. Luk\u00e1cs consequently argues\nthat the novel is the form of epic writing that is appropriate to a\nspecific moment in history. In modernity, epic writing no longer has a\ndistinct form that can express a particular relation between life and\nessence within a totality. Rather, the form of the novel is an attempt\nto deal with the absence of this relation (1916: 59; see Jameson 1971:\n172).\n\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s understanding of alienation as a historical loss of\ntotality and the consequent problem of form allows him to formulate\nthe kernel of a Utopian vision: the very form of the novel points to\nthe possibility of a renewed relation between the individual and the\nworld in which meaning can again be found. \n",
