The Ethics of Public Goods: Should the Government Pay for Public Goods?\n\nIt is sometimes suggested that the standard justification for\ngovernment funding is attractive because it is based on a minimum of\nnormative assumptions. David Schmidtz, for example, writes that \n\n\none of the most attractive features of the public goods argument is\nthe minimal nature of the normative assumptions it must make in order\nto ground a justification of the state. (Schmidtz 1991: 82) \n\n\nIndeed, it seems that all that is required is that a government\nintervention is justified if it brings about a state of affairs that\nmakes everyone better off than under any non-intervention\nalternative.\n",
