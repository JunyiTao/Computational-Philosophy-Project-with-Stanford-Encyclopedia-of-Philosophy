Continental Feminism and Trans Studies\n\nA number of scholars have noted the complex interplay of shared and\ndistinct concerns between trans, feminist, and queer frameworks\n(Namaste 1996 and 2009; Prosser 1998; Heyes 2003; Salamon 2010a;\nStryker 2004). Emerging in the 1990s as a distinct field of academic\ninquiry, trans studies shares many of the intellectual roots of queer\ntheory yet also departs from queer studies through its explicit focus\non trans experience, including both non-monolithic nature of that\nexperience and the importance of trans people speaking for themselves\nabout their own lives. Likewise, while many of the theoretical\nframeworks and figures at the heart of Continental feminism are\npresent in trans studies (e.g., post-structuralism, phenomenology,\nFoucauldian genealogy, materialism), there have also been important\ncritiques of how Continental feminist approaches can ignore or\nsideline trans experience. Significantly, many of the philosophers\nworking in Continental feminism and trans studies cited in this entry\ncross inter- and intra-disciplinary boundaries.\n\nIn exploring the relationship between Continental feminist and trans\nstudies, it is crucial to acknowledge the forms that transphobia and\ntrans-exclusionary gestures can assume in feminist discourse more\ngenerally. For an extended overview of this history, see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on trans issues.\n The entry explains points of terminology (trans, transgender, trans*,\ntranssexual), as well as the historical emergence of transgender\nstudies and the broader (i.e., non-Continental specific) relationship\nbetween feminist and trans issues.\n\nIn one widely recognized form of feminist transphobia (found in the\nwork of trans-exclusionary radical feminists such as Janice Raymond),\ntrans women are portrayed as not \u201creal\u201d women and as\nthreats to feminist movements (Bettcher 2006, 2007; McKinnon 2018).\nHowever, there is another strand of feminist theory that has a\ndistinct relationship to trans issues, and (importantly for present\npurposes) it is a lineage of feminism that draws heavily on\nContinental figures such as Butler. While there is no doubt that\nButler\u2019s work has been foundational in trans studies as well as\nin queer theory (Gerdes 2014; Salah 2007), it is also the case that\nher work has been critiqued for its selective use of trans experience\n(Prosser 1998; Namaste 1996; H. Rubin 1998). Critics point out that\ntrans identity tends be affirmed in Butlerian queer feminist discourse\nwhen it can be used to demonstrate the actual constructedness of\ngender, or its lack of ontological necessity, but also that some trans\nidentity is portrayed as problematically essentialist when accompanied\nby claims to \u201creally be\u201d a man or a woman and/or demands\nfor medical transition (Valentine 2012). While Prosser and Rubin both\ncritique this rejection of claims to gender realness from a\nphenomenological perspective (and Prosser (1998) from a psychoanalytic\nframework as well), Namaste (1996) focuses on the institutional\nreality of gender that is often sidelined in these debates. In\nresponse, Jack Halberstam has argued that, while Prosser\u2019s\nfrustration with a selective use of trans identity in queer and\nfeminist theory is understandable, there are still significant\nproblems with the normativity inherent in the idea of gendered\nrealness (2005).\n\nNotably, the proliferation of non-trans feminist writers working on\ntrans issues in the 1990s led to Jacob Hale\u2019s \u201cSuggested\nRules for Non-Transsexuals Writing about Transsexuals, Transsexuality,\nTranssexualism, or Trans\u201d (1997\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n Significant non-trans feminist analyses, following Hale and the\nemergence of transgender studies, include work by Cressida Heyes\n(2003) and Naomi Scheman (1996, 2016), both of whom articulate\ntheoretical bases for solidarity between cis and trans feminists.\nThere are also important instances of cis feminist theorists bringing\ntrans issues directly into their own work as serious interlocutors,\nrather than as thought experiments (Ahmed 2016b; Colebrook 2015;\nShotwell & Sangrey 2008) and collaborating with trans theorists\n(Heyes & Latham 2018). The term \u201ccis\u201d itself has also\nreceived more scholarly attention in the last two decades (Aultman\n2014). While the original intention behind the term was to\ndenaturalize non-trans subject positions, not all scholars agree that\nthe term successfully destabilizes gender norms, particularly insofar\nas such norms are racialized (Enke 2012b).\n\nMore recently, there have been many new trajectories established at\nthe crossroads of Continental and trans approaches to gender. A number\nof philosophers have written at the intersections of phenomenology and\ntrans studies, particularly in critical phenomenology, which\nemphasizes questions of oppression and power in examining how things\nappear to us in the world (Weiss, Murphy, & Salamon 2020). Ephraim\nDas Janssen uses phenomenology, including the work of Martin\nHeidegger, to examine what transgender experience tells us about\ngender (2017). Megan Burke (2019) takes up Beauvoirian concepts to\nexplore androgyny, trans identity, and agender experience. Gayle\nSalamon draws on the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to develop a\nphenomenology of transphobia in The Life and Death of Latisha\nKing (2018a). Salamon merges a tradition of earlier work in\nphenomenology and trans studies (H. Rubin 1998; Prosser 1998) with\ncritical phenomenology. Tamsin Kimoto (2018) has also used both\nMerleau-Ponty and Frantz Fanon to explore hormonal transition and\ntransphobia.\n\nAlong similar lines, new work in psychoanalysis and trans studies is\nalso revising longstanding psychoanalytic approaches to sex and\ngender, including coercive and pathologizing theories of trans\nsubjectivity (Elliot 2014), and is using resources in psychoanalysis\nto theorize trans experiences from a less pathologizing perspective\n(Breslow 2017; Carlson 2010; Coffman 2017; Cavanagh 2010). For\nexample, Amy Ray Stewart uses Julia Kristeva\u2019s concept of\n\u201cintimate revolt\u201d to illuminate trans and queer\nexperiences of psychic life (2017). Patricia Gherovici (2017) has\nwritten about trans phenomena and the need to revise psychoanalytic\nconcepts using Lacanian theory and her own clinical experience working\nwith trans people. Relying on both psychoanalytic and phenomenological\nframeworks, Salamon (2010a) has also defended Butler\u2019s account\nof gender against the aforementioned critiques of its treatment of\ntrans experience and developed her own psychoanalytic and\nphenomenological account of a dissonance between a felt sense of\ngender and an external appearance of a body that is attuned to trans\nexperience.\n\nThere is also a body of work emerging that puts foundational figures\nin Continental feminism into conversation with trans studies. Marie\nDraz (2018) has placed feminist philosophical uses of Nietzsche, such\nas in the work of Butler (1990) and Rosalyn Diprose (2002), into\nconversation with trans scholarship on the institutionalization of\ngender categories, while Tim Johnston (2015) has argued that although\nscholars of gender and sexuality have used Irigarayan resources for\ndiscussing trans and queer issues, Irigaray\u2019s own claim that\nontology is sexed and that there is an impassable limit between the\nsexes conveys an unsalvageable cissexism, or privileging of non-trans\nexperience. In a similar vein, Oli Stephano (2019) critiques Elizabeth\nGrosz\u2019s emphasis on the irreducibility of sexual difference,\nshowing that her ontology invalidates trans embodiment and\nsubjectivities. This critique of Grosz follows earlier work by Eva\nHayward (2017) on the transphobic implications of some of\nGrosz\u2019s feminist materialist arguments. Gayle Salamon also\ncritically examines the way that sexual difference operates as a limit\nto the reimagining of embodiment and materiality in the work of both\nIrigaray and Grosz (Salamon 2010a). Mar\u00eda Lugones is another\nfigure of widespread use in Continental feminism who has been\nregularly cited in scholarship on trans issues (Bettcher 2014b;\nDiPietro 2019; Draz 2017a; Malatino 2019). Finally, like Butler, the\nuse of Foucault in trans studies has also changed dramatically over\nthe last several decades. For example, Foucault\u2019s work on types\nof modern power has been used (alongside women of color feminism,\nindigenous scholarship, and numerous other sources) to examine the\nviolence caused by how state institutions administer legal gender\ncategories in sex-segregated institutions and identity documents\n(Spade 2011 [2015]). Foucauldian feminist accounts of prison and\npunishment have also been put into conversation with scholarship\nrooted in trans and gender non-conforming experience (Dilts 2017;\nVitulli 2018; Zurn 2016, 2019).\n\nTrans studies continues, in different veins, many of the foundational\nquestions of Continental feminism by bringing the tools of Continental\nphilosophy to bear on questions of sex, gender, and sexuality, and\nvice versa, and it continually orients these conversations in new\ndirections. Much of this work is informed by other areas of critical\ntheory (e.g., critical race theory and decolonial theory) and pushes\nthe traditional boundaries of Continental feminism. Recent scholarship\non blackness and trans history, for example, has articulated the\nimportance of developing frameworks capable of understanding the\ndimensions of racialized gender historically and today (Snorton 2017)\nand work on migration and Latinx trans people has highlighted the need\nto attend to both the limits of our political theory and the\nproductive capacities of trans people of color for generating new\nworlds (Pitts 2018). Current conversations about the relationship\nbetween Continental feminism and trans studies must also involve\nattention to the material conditions of the academy itself, as the\ngrowing attention to trans experience in philosophy more broadly has\nnot resulted in more trans voices and trans academics (Bettcher 2018\n(Other Internet Resources); Marvin 2019, 2020). Future directions in\nContinental feminism and trans studies will need to be attentive not\nonly to the intriguing philosophical questions occurring in these\nconversations, but also to the specific contours of the material\nconditions that allow trans scholarship to flourish.\n",
