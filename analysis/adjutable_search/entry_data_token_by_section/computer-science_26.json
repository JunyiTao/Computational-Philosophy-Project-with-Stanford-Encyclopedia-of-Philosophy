    "main_text": "Correctness || Physical Correctness\n7.2 Physical Correctness\n\nFetzer (1988) objected that deductive reasoning is only able to\nguarantee for the correctness of a program with respect to its\nspecifications, but not for the correctness of a computational system,\nthat is also accounting for the program\u2019s physical\nimplementation. Even if the program were correct with respect to any\nof the related upper LoAs (algorithms, specifications, requirements),\nits implementation could still violate one or more of the intended\nspecifications due to a physical malfunctioning. The former kind of\ncorrectness can in principle be proved mathematically, but the\ncorrectness of the execution LoA requires an empirical assessment. As\nexamined in\n \u00a76.2,\n software testing can show only in principle the correctness of a\ncomputational system. In practice, the number of allowed executions of\nnon-trivial systems are potentially infinite and cannot be\nexhaustively checked in a finite (or reasonable) amount of time\n(Dijkstra 1974). Most successful testing methods rather see both\nformal verification and testing used together to reach a satisfactory\ncorrection level.\n\nAnother objection to the theoretical possibility of mathematical\ncorrectness is that since proofs are carried out by a theorem prover,\ni.e. a physical machine, the knowledge one attains about computational\nsystems is not a-priori but empirical (see Turner 2018 ch.\n25). However, Burge (1988) argues that computer-based proofs of\ncorrectness can still be regarded as a-priori, in that even\nthough their possibility depends on sensory experience, their\njustification does not (as it is for a-posteriori knowledge).\nFor instance, the knowledge that red is a color is a-priori\neven though it requires having sensory experience of red; this is\nbecause \u2018red is a colour\u2019 is true independently of any\nsensory experience. For further discussion on the nature of the use of\ncomputers in mathematical proofs, see (Hales 2008; Harrison 2008;\nTymoczko 1979, 1980).\n\nThe problem of correctness eventually reduces to asking what it means\nfor a physical machine to satisfy an abstract requirement. According\nto the simple mapping account, a computational system\nS is a correct implementation of specification SP\nonly if:\n\nthere can be established a morphism from the states ascribed to\nS to the states defined by SP, and\nfor any state transition \\(s_1 \\rightarrow s_2\\) in S\nthere is a state transition \\(s'_1 \\rightarrow s'_2\\) in SP\nbetween state \\(s'_1\\) mapping to \\(s_1\\) and state \\(s'_2\\) mapping\nto \\(s_2\\).\n\n\nThe simple mapping account only demands for an extensional agreement\nbetween the description of S and SP. The weakness of\nthis account is that it is quite easy to identify an extensional\nagreement between any couple of physical system-specification, leaving\nroom for a pancomputationalist perspective.\n\nThe danger of pancomputationalism has led some authors to attempt an\naccount of correct implementation that somehow restricts the class of\npossible interpretations. In particular,\n\nThe causal account (D. J. Chalmers 1996; Copeland 1996)\nsuggests that the material conditional (if the system is in the\nphysical state \\(s_1\\) \u2026) is replaced by a counterfactual\none.\nThe semantic account argues that a computational system\nmust be associated with a semantic description, specifying what the\nsystem is to achieve (Sprevak 2012). For example, a physical device\ncould be interpreted as an AND gate or an OR gate but without a\ndefinition of the device there is no way of fixing what the artifact\nis.\nThe syntactic account demands that only physical states\nthat can be defined as syntactic can be mapped onto computational\nstates. What remains to be examined is what defines a syntactic state\n(see Piccinini 2015 or the entry on\n computation in physical systems\n for an overview of the syntactic account\nThe normative account (Turner 2012) maintains not only\nthat abstract and physical computational processes must be in\nagreement, but also that the abstract specification has normative\nforce over the system. According to such an account, computations are\nphysical processes whose function is fixed by an abstract\nspecification. This relationship is stronger than both the semantic\naccount, asking for a simple descriptive relationship, and the\nsyntactic account, focusing on a syntactic object and its semantic\ninterpretation.\n\n",
