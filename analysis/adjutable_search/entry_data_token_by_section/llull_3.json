    "main_text": "Life and his philosophical and religious project || On the way to infidel lands\n1.3 On the way to infidel lands\n\nLlull went back to Montpellier during the summer of 1289. He stayed\nthere until the autumn of 1290. During this stay he publicly presented\nhis comments to the Art and wrote a new, simpler version of\nthis work called Ars inventiva veritatis. When he finished\nhis work in Montpellier, Llull left for Genoa, a city that held great\nrelevance to him, both for his personal relationship with the Spinola\nfamily and the events that would later unfold.\n\nIn April 1289, the city of Tripoli, in Syria, was taken by the\nEgyptians, who imprisoned the Latin armies in Acre. The Crusades are\nnearing their end, and it is a delicate political moment, among\nothers, for the Genoese who had taken part in the Crusades. Even if\nthe defense of Tripoli and Acre were not important priorities for the\npapacy, Pope Nicholas IV asked the kings of Europe to support the\nCrusade, which spawned a series of initiatives to support the\nreconquest of the Holy Land.\n\nRamon Llull arrived in Rome under these circumstances at the end of\n1290, where he writes Liber de passagio, a text preceded by a\nletter called Quomodo terra sancta recuperari potest, in\nwhich Llull took advantage of the political situation to show the\nrelevance of his mission and his Art, linking his work for\nthe first time with the Crusade and the possibility of using military\nforce against the infidels.\n\nThis visit to Rome had no beneficial outcome, and in 1291 Llull was\nback in Genoa, and this time he had the firm intention of traveling to\nTunisia to continue his missionary vocation. This trip would be filled\nwith extreme difficulties, mainly due to a profound personal\ncrisis.\n\nThis crisis, narrated in great detail in De vita, must have\nstarted when he was preparing his trip to Tunisia in the spring of\n1292 and reached its most critical point in May 1293 during the\ncelebration of Pentecost.\n\nTwo significant events must have influenced his mood. Llull had turned\n60 years old, and in January 1292 King James II had decided to close\nthe monastery of Miramar. Llull had already made the necessary\narrangements for his missionary trip, but he started to consider the\npossibility of being murdered or incarcerated by the infidels. This\nsituation caused him to be filled with fear. Consequently, he did not\nembark on this trip.\n\nAs soon as the ship that would have have taken him to Tunisia set sail\nwithout him, Llull, filled with shame, got sick. This illness would\nlast until the feast of Pentecost, in which Llull was taken to the\nChurch of Saint Dominic. While he was at the church, he had a vision\nin which he was told that \u201che would be saved in this\norder\u201d (De vita IV-20). Consequently, Llull resolved to\njoin the Dominican Order at that exact moment but was unable to\nbecause the prior was not present at the church. Finally, after a\ncareful process of deliberation and new visions, and considering that\nhis Art had been favorably received by the Franciscan Order,\nLlull decided to join the Franciscans. However, Dominguez\nR\u00e9boras (2016) suggests that there is no historical evidence\nthat Llull entered the order of Saint Fracisco. \n\nWith new found enthusiasm, even though he was still ill and feverish,\nhe embarked on the first available ship to Tunisia, but he was\npromptly stopped by his friends. A few days later, fully recovered, he\nboarded a new ship and and set sail. Around September 1293 he arrived\nin Tunisia and started his mission. His plan was to establish contact\nand prompt dialogue with the intellectual circles in the city, using\nthe method proposed in his Art to convince them of the error\nof their ways. The endeavor did not last long, and he was\nincarcerated. He was expelled from the city and sent to Naples in\nOctober 1293.\n",
