    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nMalebranche was born in Paris on August 6, 1638, one month prior to\nLouis XIV, and died, also in Paris, on October 13, 1715, six weeks\nafter the great French monarch. Malebranche was one of many children\nborn to his mother, Catherine de Lauzon, the sister of a Viceroy of\nCanada, and his father, also Nicolas Malebranche, a secretary to Louis\nXIII. As in the case of Descartes and Pascal, Malebranche was born in\nfrail health. His particular affliction was a severe malformation of\nthe spine, and due to this condition as well as his weak lungs he\nneeded to be tutored at home until the age of sixteen. Subsequently he\nwas a student at the Coll\u00e8ge de la Marche, and after graduating\nhe went to study theology at the Sorbonne. His education left him with\na distaste for a scholasticism that focused on the work of Aristotle.\nThus, in 1660 he decided to leave the universities and to enter the\nOratory, a religious congregation founded in 1611 by the Augustinian\ntheologian Pierre B\u00e9rulle (1575\u20131629). At the Oratory in\nParis, Malebranche studied ecclesiastical history, linguistics, and\nthe Bible, and with his fellow students also immersed himself in the\nwork of Augustine. He was ordained a priest on September 14, 1664.\n\nThere is the story that in the same year in which he was ordained,\nMalebranche happened in a Paris bookstall upon a posthumous edition of\nDescartes\u2019s Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019homme\n(Treatise on Man) which provides a sketch of a mechanistic\naccount of the physiology of the human body. Malebranche\u2019s early\nbiographer, Father Yves Andr\u00e9, reported that he was so\n\u201cecstatic\u201d on reading this account that he experienced\n\u201csuch violent palpitations of the heart that he was obliged to\nleave his book at frequent intervals, and to interrupt his reading of\nit in order to breathe more easily\u201d (Andr\u00e9 1886,\n11\u201312). While Andr\u00e9 does not indicate why Malebranche was\nso moved, one can speculate that he had discovered in this text a way\nto investigate the natural world without relying on a stagnant\nAristotelian scholasticism. In any case, after his encounter with\nL\u2019homme Malebranche devoted himself to a decade-long\nstudy of the Cartesian method and its results in mathematics and\nnatural philosophy.\n\nThe fruit of this study is a two-volume work bearing the title, De\nla recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. O\u00f9 l\u2019on traitte\nde la nature de l\u2019esprit de l\u2019homme, et de l\u2019usage\nqu\u2019il en doit faire pour eviter l\u2019erreur dans les\nsciences (Search after Truth. In which is treated the nature\nof the human mind and the use that must be made of it to avoid error\nin the sciences ) (1674\u201375). It is primarily this text\nwhich provides the basis for Malebranche\u2019s reputation in the\nmodern period. As its full title indicates, the Recherche\nfocuses on the principal sources of human error and on the method for\navoiding those errors and for finding the truth. The first five books\nenumerate the various errors deriving from the senses, imagination,\npure understanding, inclinations and passions, respectively, and a\nsixth book is devoted to the Cartesian method of avoiding such errors\nthrough attention to clear and distinct ideas. The centerpiece of the\nthird book, on pure understanding, is a defense of the claim that the\nideas through which we perceive bodies exist in God. Tucked away in\nthe final book, on method, is a critique of \u201cthe most dangerous\nerror of the ancients,\u201d namely, the Aristotelian position that\nthere are secondary causes in nature distinct from God.\n\nThe first volume of the Recherche, containing the first three\nbooks, drew an immediate response in 1675 from the abb\u00e9 Simon\nFoucher (1644\u20131696), canon of Sainte Chapelle of Dijon. Foucher\nwas an \u201cacademic skeptic\u201d who attacked the assumption that\nideas in us can represent objects distinct from us (see Foucher 1675).\nThe Cartesian Benedictine Robert Desgabets (1610\u20131678) replied\nto Foucher by insisting that the Cartesian rule that clear and\ndistinct ideas are true presupposes that our thoughts correspond to\nreal external objects. In brief prefaces added to the second volume of\nthe Recherche, Malebranche chastised both thinkers for\nfailing to read the work they were discussing, noting in particular\nthat he had explicitly argued in the Recherche that the ideas\nwe perceive exist in God rather than in us.\n\nMalebranche solicited written responses to the Recherche\nmodeled on the sets of objections published with Descartes\u2019s\nMeditations. Perhaps put off by Malebranche\u2019s harsh\ntreatment of Foucher and Desgabets, his critics offered instead only\ninformal objections channeled through mutual friends. In 1678,\nMalebranche appended to the Recherche a set of sixteen\nEclaircissements, or clarifications, that respond to these\nobjections. Among the more important objections addressed are those\nthat concern Malebranche\u2019s assertion that we have a freedom to\n\u201cconsent\u201d to certain motives for action\n(\u201cEclaircissement I\u201d), his claim that reason provides no\nconclusive demonstration of the existence of the material world\n(\u201cEclaircissement VI\u201d), his doctrine of the vision of\nideas in God (\u201cEclaircissement X\u201d), his conclusion that we\nknow our own soul through a confused consciousness rather than through\na clear idea of its nature (\u201cEclaircissement XI\u201d), and his\noccasionalist thesis that God is the only true cause\n(\u201cEclaircissement XV\u201d). The final 1712 edition includes\nthe addition of a seventeenth Eclaircissement that defends the\nimportance \u201cnot only for knowledge of nature but also for\nknowledge of religion and morals\u201d of the view, only hinted at in\nthe initial edition of the Recherche, that God acts for the\nmost part through \u201cgeneral volitions\u201d (volontez\ng\u00e9n\u00e9rales) and acts though \u201cparticular\nvolitions\u201d (volontez particuli\u00e8res) only in the\nexceptional case of miracles.\n\nMalebranche developed this last point in his 1680 Trait\u00e9 de\nla nature et de la gr\u00e2ce (Treatise on Nature and\nGrace). He published this work over the objections of the\nJansenist theologian and Cartesian philosopher Antoine Arnauld\n(1612\u20131694), who was disturbed by what he saw as\nMalebranche\u2019s denial of the assertion in the Scriptures and the\ntradition of God\u2019s attention to particular details in matters of\ngrace. Arnauld responded to the publication of Nature et\ngr\u00e2ce by engaging in open combat, and the ensuing battle\nbecame one of the major intellectual events of the day. His opening\nsalvo was the 1683 Des vraies et des fausses id\u00e9es\n(On True and False Ideas), which attacks not Nature et\ngr\u00e2ce but rather the Recherche (see Arnauld 1683).\nArnauld\u2019s strategy here was to undermine Malebranche\u2019s\ninfluence in theological matters by revealing the inadequacy of his\nphilosophical views. In particular, he attacked Malebranche\u2019s\nassumption that ideas are \u201crepresentative beings\u201d distinct\nfrom our perceptions, offering instead the position, which he\nplausibly ascribed to Descartes, that ideas are simply a feature of\nthe perceptual modifications of our soul. This argument reflects a\nsympathy for Descartes\u2019 views that dates back to Arnauld\u2019s\nset of comments on the Meditations.\n\nThe same year that Arnauld presented his initial critique, Malebranche\npublished the M\u00e9ditations chretiennes et\nm\u00e9taphysiques (Christian and Metaphysical\nMeditations), in which \u201cthe Word\u201d (i.e., the Second\nPerson of the Trinity) offers a summary of his system that highlights\nthe central role that God plays in both metaphysics and morality. This\nwork was in some ways a follow up to his Conversations\nchr\u00e9tiennes (Christian Conversations), published\nin 1677. In that earlier text, Malebranche presented a defense of the\nChristian religion that emphasizes the Augustinian theme of our\ndependence on God for knowledge and happiness. In 1684, Malebranche\nfurther developed his views on moral theory in the Trait\u00e9\nde morale (Treatise on Ethics), in which he argued that\nmoral virtue requires a love of the \u201cimmutable order\u201d that\nGod reveals to those who seek to know it.\n\nIn 1684, Malebranche also responded to Arnauld\u2019s\nId\u00e9es, and after a further exchange on the topic of\nthe nature of ideas the debate turned to the theological issues\nconcerning divine providence, grace and miracles. The battle became\nincreasingly bitter, and as a result of a campaign on the part of\nArnauld and his supporters, Malebranche\u2019s Nature et\ngr\u00e2ce was put on the Catholic Index librorum\nprohibitorum (Index of Prohibited Books) in 1690 (the\nRecherche was added in 1709). The Malebranche-Arnauld polemic\ncontinued even after Arnauld\u2019s death in 1694, with the\npublication in 1704 of Malebranche\u2019s responses to earlier\nletters from Arnauld.\n\nIn 1688, Malebranche published his Entretiens sur la\nm\u00e9taphysique et la religion (Dialogues on Metaphysics\nand Religion), a concise summary of his main metaphysical\ndoctrines of the vision in God and occasionalism that also addresses\nthe problem of evil. In 1696, he appended to this text the\nEntretiens sur la mort (Dialogues on Death), which\nhe composed after a life-threatening illness.\n\nIn 1692, Malebranche published a short study, the Lois de la\ncommunication des mouvements (Laws of the Communication of\nMotions), in which he endorsed Descartes\u2019s law of the\nconservation of the quantity of motion but offered rules governing\ncollision that, unlike Descartes\u2019s own rules, involve no appeal\nto a force in bodies to remain at rest. In correspondence with\nMalebranche, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716) emphasized\ndifficulties with Descartes\u2019s conservation law, and that\ncorrespondence led Malebranche to insert into a 1700 edition of the\nLois the admission that experience reveals that such a law\ndoes not hold.\n\nIn 1693, Malebranche responded to the criticisms of the\nRecherche in the 1690 Syst\u00eame de philosophie\n(System of Philosophy) of the French Cartesian Pierre-Sylvain\nR\u00e9gis (1632\u20131707). R\u00e9gis had defended an account\nof ideas similar to the one that Arnauld had defended against\nMalebranche during the 1680s, and Arnauld used the\nR\u00e9gis-Malebranche exchange as an occasion to return to the\nissue of ideas during the last year of his life. Despite their\ndispute, Malebranche and R\u00e9gis were both appointed as honorary\nmembers of the Paris Acad\u00e9mie des sciences when it was\nreorganized in 1699. Malebranche presented an inaugural lecture to the\nAcad\u00e9mie that defends against Descartes an account of color in\nterms of the frequency of vibrations of light. In later published\nversions of the lecture, Malebranche revised his discussion to take\ninto account the theory of the nature of color in the work of Sir\nIsaac Newton.\n\nIn 1697, Malebranche published the Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019amour\nde Dieu (Treatise on the Love of God) with Trois\nlettres \u00e0 Lamy (Three Letters to Lamy), in which\nhe rejected the claim in the Benedictine Fran\u00e7ois Lamy\n(1636\u20131711) that the Trait\u00e9 de morale supports\nthe \u201cquietist\u201d position that moral action derives from a\ndisinterested \u201cpure love of God.\u201d This rejection of\nLamy\u2019s quietism provided the basis for Malebranche\u2019s\nreconciliation with the famous French cleric, Jacques-B\u00e9nigne\nBossuet (1627\u20131704). Bossuet had earlier enlisted the aid of\nFran\u00e7ois de F\u00e9nelon (1651\u20131715) in writing against\nMalebranche\u2019s occasionalism and his appeals to God\u2019s\n\u201cgeneral will,\u201d but later became a bitter enemy of\nF\u00e9nelon\u2019s quietism.\n\nWith the support of the apostolic vicar in China, Malebranche\npublished in 1708 an Entretien d\u2019un philosophe\nchr\u00e9tien et d\u2019un philosophe chinois, sur\nl\u2019existence et la nature de Dieu (Dialogue between a\nChristian Philosopher and a Chinese Philosopher on the Existence and\nNature of God). A sixth and last edition of the\nRecherche appeared in 1712, and in 1715 Malebranche published\nhis final work, R\u00e9flexions sur la pr\u00e9motion\nphysique (Reflections on Physical Premotion), in which\nhe responded to the claim of the abb\u00e9 Laurent-Fran\u00e7ois\nBoursier (1679\u20131749) that occasionalism leads naturally to the\nThomistic position that God determines our action by means of a\n\u201cphysical premotion.\u201d In his response, Malebranche\ndefended the claim, present from the first edition of the\nRecherche, that our free action involves a\n\u201cconsent\u201d that God does not determine.\n\nThe \u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes de Malebranche [OC], which\nconsists of 20 volumes, is the standard critical edition of\nMalebranche\u2019s writings. In France, Malebranche has always been a\nmajor figure in the history of early modern philosophy, and there is\nan extensive earlier literature on him from this country; see, for\ninstance, Gouhier (1926), Gueroult (1939), Gouhier (1948), Gueroult\n(1955\u201359), Robinet (1955), Rodis-Lewis (1963), and Robinet\n(1965). This is supplemented by the important discussion in\nAlqui\u00e9 (1974), and there is a continuation of substantive\nFrench scholarship on Malebranche in works such as Moreau (1999),\nBardout (1999), Bardout (2000), and Pellegrin (2006). Despite the\nrelative neglect of him in the corresponding Anglophone literature\nduring the earlier part of the twentieth century, Malebranche has\nbecome increasingly popular among English-language scholars more\nrecently. This change is indicated by the presence of recent English\ntranslations of his writings; see Malebranche [DM], [DC], [TE], [DMR],\nand [ST]. More recent book-length studies of Malebranche in English\ninclude McCracken (1983), Jolley (1990), Nadler (1992), Schmaltz\n(1996), Nadler (2000), Pyle (2003), and Peppers-Bates (2009), which\nadd to earlier trail-blazing studies such as Walton (1972) and Radner\n(1978). Easton, Lennon and Sebba (1991) is a comprehensive\nbibliography of work on Malebranche in various languages. This work\nsupersedes the bibliography in volume 20 of Malebranche [OC], which\nhad superseded Sebba (1959).\n",
