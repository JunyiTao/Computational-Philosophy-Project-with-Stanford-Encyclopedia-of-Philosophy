    "main_text": "Types of Modal Fictionalism || Further Extensions\n1.5 Further Extensions\n\nModal fictionalism has traditionally been conceived as fictionalism\nabout possible worlds, and implicitly also about their contents. One\nnatural way to extend modal fictionalism so understood is to admit\nimpossible worlds as well. Use of a fiction of impossible worlds is\nunlikely to seem too extravagant for many modal fictionalists, but it\nmight also provide a mechanism for non-fictionalists about possible\nworlds to talk of impossible worlds without the extra theoretical\ncosts they fear. So there is a partially fictionalist option of being\na realist of some stripe about possible worlds but a fictionalist\nabout impossible worlds (and perhaps other situations, e.g.,\nincomplete or underdetermined ones). This partial fictionalism will\nface some of the same sorts of questions, and employ the same sorts of\nstrategies, as modal fictionalism about possible worlds.\n\nAnother mixed strategy is rarely explicitly endorsed, though it may be\nimplicit in many theorists\u2019 talk. By far the majority of\nrealists about possible worlds take them to be abstract objects of\nsome sort: sets of sentences or propositions, uninstantiated\nworld-properties, unactualised maximal facts, or perhaps even as\nsui generis simples. However, their approach to merely possible\nobjects is often less explicitly spelled out. As well as possible\nworlds, merely possible objects such as blue swans, my counterparts,\nNewtonian masses, XYZ, and many others are discussed and quantified\nover. Some abstractionists will wish to identify such merely possible\nobjects with actual abstract objects \u2014 perhaps uninstantiated\nproperties that are less than world-properties, descriptions of parts\nof worlds, set-theoretic representatives, or whatever. But many more\nwill not. This is for at least three reasons. The first is the\nintuition, never entirely quelled, that a merely possible blue swan\nshould be blue and a swan. Abstract objects are\nrarely, if ever, either. The second is that it is often thought that\nthe whole point about merely possible objects is that they do not\nexist, but might have. Admitting their literal existence by\nidentifying them with actual existing abstract objects will go against\nthe grain for many. Finally, many theories of possible worlds lack\nobvious candidates to play the roles of merely possible objects. This\nis most obvious for those theories that take possible worlds to be\nsimples, but it is also not straightforward to divide a set of\npropositions into \u201cobject shaped\u201d components, or to\ndistinguish one merely possible object from its duplicates if one\nidentifies worlds with world-properties, and furthermore seeks to\ndivide these up to yield merely possible less-than-world-sized\nobjects. Fictionalism about merely possible objects is an\nunderappreciated theory, and should perhaps recommend itself to more\nabstractionists about possible worlds than it in fact does.\n",
