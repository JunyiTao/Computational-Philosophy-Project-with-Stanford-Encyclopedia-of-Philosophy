Yet Dewey rejected accounts of the right that\ndefined it in terms of promoting the good (E 214\u2013216). The\nconcept of the right contains an element not contained in the good\n\u2014 namely, that of an authoritative demand. The phenomenology of\nclaims of good and right are also distinct: the good attracts or\nappeals, whereas claims of right appear to command authority. The\ndemands of the right often conflict with individual desire, since they\narise from the conflicting, socially authorized claims of other\npeople. The right arises from the need to harmonize the claims of\npeople with distinct interests and conceptions of the good by means of\nreasonable principles that all can accept. Thus, although claims of\nright are grounded in people\u2019s interests in gaining the\nassistance and cooperation of others, and in protection against\nothers\u2019 encroachments, the right cannot be defined in terms of\npromoting the good of any individual. Nor can it be defined in terms\nof promoting some independent conception of the good of society as a\nwhole, since any such conception must already persuade the individual\nthat it accords a reasonable place for her own claims, and thus\nalready incorporate a notion of right (E 215\u20137; TIF\n284\u20135).\n\nThe deontological thought that the right is independent of the good\nreflects the reality that the claims of others, even when reasonable\nand authoritative, do not automatically harmonize with the desires of\nthe individual upon whom the claims are made. However, Dewey rejected\nthe further deontological claim that there is a sharp distinction\nbetween the moral and nonmoral good, where the former is identified\nwith conformity to the right, and the latter with satisfying\nindividual desires. After all, claims of right are designed to protect\nand advance the interests of individuals that are considered important\nenough to warrant social support. Moreover, they are constitutive\nfeatures of social relationships that people find good. The authority\nof these claims draws on the appeal of these relationships and on the\nmotives of love, respect, and loyalty cultivated within them (E\n218\u2013219).\n\nDeontological theories tend to identify the right either with fixed\nlaws or rules of conduct, such as the Ten Commandments, or with a\nsingle supreme principle of morality, such as the Categorical\nImperative, understood as supplying a decision procedure in ethics.\nThe attempt to specify substantive rules of right conduct for all\ncases founders on the need to make exceptions for different\ncircumstances. \u201cThou shalt not kill\u201d cannot be taken at\nface value, given the justifiability of killing in self-defense. Yet\nit is impossible to specify in advance all of the circumstances that\ncould justify killing even in self-defense, given the complications\nthat arise in, say, defensive warfare (e.g., problems of collateral\ndamage). As social conditions change \u2014 for example, the\ntechnology and tactics of warfare, and our ability to affect the\ninterests of distant others \u2014 rules of conduct that had been\naccepted in the past must be subject to revision, lest learning cease\nand people remain mired in dysfunctional habits (E 275\u20139). A\nmethod of moral inquiry is needed that can revise given rules, laws,\nand habits in light of new problems and circumstances. This method\nwould take current and past customs and laws as starting points for\nmoral theory, in conjunction with the history and anthropology of\ncustom, the history of systematic theoretical reflection on morality,\nand the social sciences, which inform us of the nature of current\nproblems, and the probable consequences of attempting to institute\nthis or that new law or custom (E 178\u20139). Intelligent moral\ninquiry, while it begins with current customs and convictions about\nthe right, treats them as hypotheses to be tested in experience.\n\nThe attempt to identify a decision procedure for the right independent\nof considerations of the consequences of following certain principles\nis also bound to fail. Dewey endorsed the \u201cempty\nformalism\u201d critique of Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative,\ninsofar as it aspires to reach moral conclusions without presupposing\nanything to be good. Yet, reinterpreted as tools of moral inquiry, as\nstandpoints from which to identify and analyze morally relevant\nconsiderations, principles such as the Golden Rule and the Categorical\nimperative offer sound advice: they are designed to ensure that the\ninterests of all have been fairly considered in formulating concrete\nprinciples of conduct proposed as general laws or customs to be\ngenerally enforced (E 223\u20135, 280\u20133).\n",
