    "main_text": "The Man and His Work || Philo Alexandrinus\n1.1 Philo Alexandrinus\n\nIt is impossible to give precise dates for Philo\u2019s birth. The\nconsensus is that he lived between the end of the first century BCE\nand the middle of the first century CE, during a period of acute\nagitation and interethnic tensions in Alexandria. The Romans, with\ntheir universal ambitions, had replaced the Macedonians, leaving to\nthe Greeks only the pride of their identity and some fiscal\nadvantages. The Greeks in turn pretended to be the only citizens of\nthe city of Alexandria, refusing citizenship to the Jews with very few\nexceptions, among which was Alexander the Alabarch (tax collector),\nPhilo\u2019s brother (Bloch 2021, Siegert 2021). Alexander\u2019s\nson, in turn, became one of the famous apostates in the history of\nJudaism, becoming prefect of Egypt in 66\u201369 CE and serving as\nEmperor Titus\u2019 second-in-command at the siege of Jerusalem in 70\nCE. The history of the apostate within his family was certainly a\nproblem for Philo, who tried to raise the issue with his nephew in the\n(De providentia 2 and in the De animalibus. Though\nhe never specified his own political status, Philo was likely a\ncitizen of this prestigious city. Finally, the native Egyptians were\ndespised by both Greeks and Jews. The Egyptians didn\u2019t all\nremain passive, however; Manetho (Stern 1974, texts n.19\u201321), an\nEgyptian priest, wrote a parody of the Exodus, transforming the\nliberation of Israel into the ignominious expulsion of a disabled and\ndishonest people. This topos won great favor among Greek\nintellectuals like Philo\u2019s contemporary, Apion, against whom\nFlavius Josephus wrote his famous apology of the Jewish people. This\ntension erupted into the Alexandria riots of 38 CE, the first major\npogrom in the history of Jewish people, leading in turn to the\ninstallation of a ghetto, murders, tortures, humiliations, and\nmockeries of Agrippa I, the king of Judaea (van der Horst 2003). We\nmust keep all this in mind in order not to imagine Philo merely as a\nscholar burrowed away in the Great Library, nor as a rabbi lecturing\npeacefully in the synagogues. In Spec. 3.1, he wistfully\nremembers a time when he could devote himself to study and\ncontemplation, probably before the disasters of 38 CE: \n\n\nThere was a time when I had leisure for philosophy and for the\ncontemplation of the universe and its contents, when I made its spirit\nmy own in all its beauty and loveliness and true blessedness, when my\nconstant companions were divine themes and verities, when I rejoiced\nwith a joy that never cloyed or sated. \n\n\nBut just after, he evokes the violent envy of those who plunged him\n\u201cin[to] the ocean of civil cares\u201d, likely an allusion to\nthe many difficulties created by the hostility of Greeks and Egyptians\n(Spec. 3.1). Even before this violence, however, the\nenvironment he faced was a hostile and resentful one. Philo considered\nthe Egyptians, his \u201cultimate other\u201d (Niehoff 2001), the\nmost disgusting of polytheists because of their zoolatry. He was full\nof reverence and fear toward the Romans, or at least pretends as such\nin his two books on the pogrom of 38 CE: the In Flaccum,\nwhich is against the Roman prefect in Alexandria at the moment of the\npogrom, and the Legatio (Smallwood 1961) in which he narrates\nhis own experience of the embassy sent to the Emperor Caligula by the\nJews of Alexandria after the riot. Recently Niehoff stressed the idea\nthat Roman culture had become an important element of Philo\u2019s\nidentity (Niehoff 2018). Nevertheless, he was first and foremost a Jew\nof the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Bible (ca 270\nBCE). That is to say, however distinctive his views, he was a\nsincerely pious Jew. He knew very little Hebrew, though he went to\nJerusalem to pray and offer sacrifices in the Temple (Prov.\n2.107), and he thought that the Bible written in Greek was perfectly\nequivalent to the Hebrew one (Mos. 2.40). His\npaideia or Greek education was excellent, both in philosophy\nand the liberal arts, as he says in Congr. 79\u201380: \n\n\nFor instance when first I was incited by the goads of philosophy to\ndesire her I consorted in early youth with one of her handmaids,\nGrammar, and all that I begat by her, writing, reading and study of\nthe writings of the poets, I dedicated to her mistress.\n\n\nBy this period in Alexandria, the spirit of mutual comprehension that\nmarked the beginning of the Ptolemaic epoch (ca 332\nBCE\u201330 BCE) had faded away. In his own person, Philo brought\ntogether two elements that the Greek elite now held to be\nincompatible: paideia, Greek education, and Judaism. He\nstudied and commented on the Bible in the synagogues, which he\ndescribes as \u201cschools of virtue\u201d. His understanding of\nrhetoric was not merely theoretical. He was probably a great orator.\nThe addressees of his treatises were foremost the Jews, both believers\nand unbelievers. He may have had a second, much more hypothetical,\naudience in mind as well: Greek philosophers and intellectuals more\ngenerally. However, to the best of our knowledge, this latter group\npaid scant attention to Philo\u2019s writings. In the fragments of\nGreek and Roman writers carefully collected by Menahem Stern (1974),\nwe find two kinds of Greek reactions towards Judaism. In the earlier\nperiod, they received some sympathy from philosophers; Theophrastus,\nthe main disciple of Aristotle, writes in a famous fragment that Jews\nare \u201cphilosophers by race\u201d, saying about them: \n\n\nthey converse with each other about the deity, and at night-time they\nmake observations of the stars, gazing at them and calling on God by\nprayer. (quoted in Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica,\n40.3.1\u20133) \n\n\nFrom the end of the second century BCE, however, many philosophers\nwere active propagandists for\n antisemitism.[1]\n One might have expected that Stoicism, with its cosmopolitism and\nrational humanism, would have avoided this kind of attitude. In fact,\nas we can see in Posidonius, Seneca, or Chaeremon, Stoic antisemitism\nwas a product not of racism, but of an erroneous understanding of\nrationalism and universalism. For these men, the Jews were a very\nsuperstitious nation, blemished by strange habits and strong animosity\ntowards foreigners. Except for the case of Varro, the Roman scholar of\nthe first century BCE who appreciated Jews for their refusal of images\n(Lehmann 1997), it would be impossible to give an example of a Greek\nor Latin text of this period showing sympathy or even interest toward\nthe Jews. This was a condition of which Philo could not have been\nignorant. In the background of his life and of his work lay an\nantisemitism growing more and more violent. In contrast to Flavius,\nwho decades later wrote the Against Apion in order to refute\nGreek antisemitism, Philo seems to have preferred to extol the virtues\nof Judaism than to fight against the adversaries of Jews, as we can\nsee in the extant fragments of his Hypotetica.\n",
