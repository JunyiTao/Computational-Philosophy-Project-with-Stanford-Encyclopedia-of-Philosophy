    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe core idea of supervenience is captured by the slogan, \u201cthere\ncannot be an A-difference without a\nB-difference.\u201d It is important to notice the word\n\u2018cannot\u2019. Supervenience claims do not merely say that it\njust so happens that there is no A-difference\nwithout a B-difference; they say that there cannot\nbe one. A-properties supervene on B-properties if\nand only if a difference in A-properties requires a\ndifference in B-properties\u2014or, equivalently, if and\nonly if exact similarity with respect to B-properties\nguarantees exact similarity with respect to\nA-properties. Supervenience claims thus have modal force. The\nkind of modal force can vary; different supervenience claims might\nattribute different kinds of necessity to the connection between\nB-properties and A-properties (see\n Section 3.1.)\n Even when the modality is fixed, however, there are a number of\ndistinct claims that might be expressed by the slogan. A good deal of\nphilosophical work has gone into distinguishing these forms of\nsupervenience, and into examining their pairwise logical\nrelations.\n\nWe will begin with a few brief historical remarks\n (Section 2),\n and then turn to some general questions about supervenience, such as\nwhether it is explanatory and whether it is guarantees entailment\n (Section 3).\n We will then explore the various versions of supervenience in some\ndetail\n (Section 4).\n The technical work is interesting in its own right, but it is\nobviously made more interesting by the fact that the different\nvarieties of supervenience may be useful for different philosophical\npurposes. Thus, although most of this entry will be concerned with\nsupervenience itself rather than its applications, we will end with a\ndiscussion of some of the substantive philosophical issues to which\nsupervenience is relevant\n (Section 5).\n\nReaders primarily interested only in an overview of the relations\nbetween the main varieties of supervenience should skip to\n Section 4.\n The technical definitions are also collated in an\n Appendix.\n\n",
