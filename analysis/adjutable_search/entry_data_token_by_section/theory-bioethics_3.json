    "main_text": "What is the Nature of Applied Ethics?\n2. What is the Nature of Applied Ethics?\n\nWe have briefly reviewed the variety of tasks and problems to which\nbioethics addresses itself. But we should also briefly examine the\nways in which bioethics, and its broader cousin applied ethics, is and\nhas been conceptualized. Such an examination is important within the\ncontext of this entry in that questions about the nature of applied\nethics are often implicitly questions about the relation between the\ntheoretical and the applied, or between \u201ctheory\u201d and\n\u201cpractice\u201d. The very term applied ethics suggests that the\ndiscipline involves an application of some sort or other moral theory\nto the practical problem or question at hand. Arthur Caplan writes\nthat many contributors to the field of bioethics take applied ethics\nto involve the application of existing theories and principles to\nmoral problem in medicine (Caplan 1980: 25\u201326). But what does it\nmean to apply an existing theory to a practical problem? How easily\ncan the distinction between applied ethics and ethical theory be\nsustained? As it turns out, many say that the field of applied ethics\ncannot be what the name would lead us to suppose it is.\n",
