Infiniteness\n\nAt the beginning of Book III, Aristotle had linked the issue of motion\nto that of the continuous but also to that of the infinite\n(Phys. 200b16\u201318) because the continuous can be divided\nwithout limit. Averroes commented there that the advocates of atoms,\ni.e., the thesis that bodies are composed of a limited quantity of\nindivisible parts, would not agree with the definition that\n\u201ccontinuous is that which divides into infinite\u201d. He\nadded:\n\n\nMaybe [Aristotle] said so because continuous can have another\ndefinition, like as that saying that \u201cthe continuous is that in\nthe middle of which a common bound to two parts can be\nestablished\u201d. (LC 86A TC1; cf. Categories\n5a14\u201315)\n\n\nThe infinite can be seen under various aspects including intellects\nand geometrical extensions, but the philosopher of Nature has to\nenquire only about the infinite \u201cwhich concerns the extensions\nthat are in matter\u201d (LC 102K TC39). He realizes that there is\nneither continuous nor discrete infinite actually existent. The\ninfinite can only exist in potentiality.\n\nFurther Averroes agrees with Aristotle that spatial extension can be\ndivided in infinitum which does not mean that it actually\nhappens. For the possibility of an infinite by addition, Averroes\nechoes al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s and Avempace\u2019s\ncommentaries while explaining the passage 206b16\u201326 (LC\n113H\u2013114G T60).\n\n\nIf we would affirm an endless decrease (diminutio), it would\nbe not impossible because decrease is going towards nothing (ad\nnihil), the cause of which is matter; addition is going towards\nbeing, the cause of which is form, infinity exists because of matter,\nas finiteness does because of form. (LC 114B).\n\n\nAverroes disagrees with al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Avempace who held\nthe view that just as the geometer can always draw a longer line\nin infinitum, so a magnitude can always grow larger. For him\nthere is a major difference between the geometer and the philosopher\nof Nature who can conceive infinity in addition only by means of\naddition of finite quantities, and so interprets Aristotle.\nImagination is responsible for the misunderstanding (LC 120IK\nTC75).\n\nAdding and deducting finite magnitudes is true in potentiality, but an\nincreasing or decreasing of a whole is not possible, neither\npotentially nor actually. And Averroes does not comment on\nAristotle\u2019s words that time, motion, and thought must be\nconsidered infinite (208a20\u201321), and he only remarks \u201cthe\ninfinity which is found in them is not stable, i.e., existing in\nactuality, and that is impossible, but it is successive\u201d (LC\n121A TC75).\n",
