    "main_text": "\n\nDignity is a complex concept. In academic and legal contexts, it is\ntypically used in the couplet \u201chuman dignity\u201d to denote a\nkind of basic worth or status that purportedly belongs to all persons\nequally, and which grounds fundamental moral or political duties or\nrights. In this sense, many believe that dignity is a defining ideal\nof the contemporary world, especially in western society. However, the\nconcept of dignity has long been associated with many more meanings,\nsome of which cut in distinctly different directions: rank, station,\nhonor, uniqueness, beauty, poise, gravitas, integrity, self-respect,\nself-esteem, a sacred place in the order of things, supreme worth, and\neven the apex of astrological significance. Some of these connotations\nhave faded with time. But most have enduring influence.\n\nSo, what exactly is dignity? Do its different connotations hang\ntogether in any principled way? Does dignity understood as\n\u201cuniversal human worth\u201d, for example, have any meaningful\nconnection to \u201csocial rank\u201d or \u201cpersonal\nintegrity\u201d? Is dignity primarily a moral concept or a political\nand legal one? Even assuming we can make sense of its different\nmeanings, what does dignity demand of us? What does it mean to\nrecognize or respect it? Does it ground rights? If so, which ones? And\nwhere does the idea of dignity come from? What, in other words, is its\nhistory?\n\nThis entry will take up these questions, but without any pretense of\nbeing exhaustive. The goal is to provide a general guide to existing\ntheory and debate, with a focus on philosophical approaches to human\ndignity, and mostly as it figures into the western tradition. The vast\nliterature makes anything more ambitious than this unrealistic, even\nfor an encyclopedic survey.\n",
