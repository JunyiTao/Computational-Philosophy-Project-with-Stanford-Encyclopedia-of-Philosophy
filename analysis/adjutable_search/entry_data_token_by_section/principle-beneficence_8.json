Beneficence in Biomedical Ethics\n\n\nSince the late 1970s, principles of beneficence have been a mainstay\nof the literature of biomedical ethics. Persons engaged in medical\npractice, research, and public health appreciate that risks of harm\npresented by interventions must often be weighed against possible\nbenefits for patients, subjects, and the public. Their professional\nobligations are deeply informed by their commitments to prevent or\nreduce harm and to produce a positive balance of goods over inflicted\nharms.\n",
