    "main_text": "Logic || Predication\n2.2 Predication\n\nThe starting point of Paul\u2019s theory of predication is his\ndoctrine of universals. Just like Wyclif and his followers (Alyngton,\nPenbygull, Sharpe, Milverley, Whelpdale, Tarteys), the Augustinian\nmaster claims that\n\nThere are real universals, which are common essences naturally apt\nto be present in and predicated of many similar individuals.\nReal universals and their individuals are really the same and only\nformally distinct.\nPredication is first of all a real relation between metaphysical\nentities (QdU, fols. 124ra, 124vb, 127va, 132va).\n\n\nBut his analysis of predication is different from those of both Wyclif\nand his followers. In fact, Paul divides predication into identical\npredication and formal predication and defines them in a different way\nthan his sources do.\n\nTo speak of identical predication it is sufficient that the\nform signified by the subject-term of a (true) proposition and the\nform signified by the predicate-term share at least one of their\nsubstrates of existence. This is the case for propositions like\n\u2018Man is (an) animal\u2019 and \u2018The universal-man is\nsomething white\u2019 (\u2018Homo in communi est\nalbum\u2019). One speaks of formal predication in two\ncases:\n\nWhen for the truth of the proposition it is necessary that the\nform signified by the predicate-term is present in all the\nsubstrates of existence of the form signified by the subject-term, in\nvirtue of a formal principle (made clear in the proposition itself)\nthat is in turn directly present in all the substrates of existence of\nthe form signified by the subject-term. This is the case for\npropositions like \u2018Man is formally (an) animal\u2019 and\n\u2018Socrates qua man is an animal\u2019.\nOr else when the predicate of the proposition is a term of second\nintention, like \u2018species\u2019 or \u2018genus\u2019. This is\nthe case for propositions like \u2018Man is a species\u2019 and\n\u2018Animal is a genus\u2019 (SN, part VI, chap. 2, fol.\n93vab; QdU, fols. 124vb\u2013125rb).\n\n\nAs is evident, identical predication is extensionally defined, whereas\nformal predication is intensionally defined, since formal predication\nentails a relation modally determined between the subject-thing and\nthe predicate-thing. In fact, formal predication presupposes that\nthere is a necessary connection between the subject-thing and\nthe predicate-thing of the given proposition. For this reason, Paul\ndenies that sentences like \u2018(What is) singular is (what is)\nuniversal\u2019 (\u2018Singulare est universale\u2019),\nwhich Wyclif and his followers acknowledged as true, are in fact true\npropositions. For Wyclif and his followers, the sentence at issue is\nan example of predication by essence. But for Paul of Venice, it is an\nexample of formal predication; no individual qua individual\nis a universal, or vice versa, as no second intention\nintensionally considered is any other second intention (QdU,\nfol. 133va; In Porph., prooem., fol. 3ra\u2013b).\nAs a consequence, Paul rewrites the preceding sentence in this form:\n\u2018(What is) singular is this universal\u2019\n(\u2018Singulare est hoc universale\u2019), where the\npresence of the demonstrative \u2018this\u2019 changes the kind of\npredication from formal to identical. So corrected, the sentence is\ntrue, since it signifies that a certain entity, in itself singular, is\nthe substrate of existence of a universal essence (QdU, fol.\n133va\u2013b).\n\nAs a result, Paul builds up a mixed system, where the copula of the\nstandard philosophical sentences he deals with can have a threefold\nvalue: it means a partial identity between the subject-thing and the\npredicate-thing in the case of identical predication; it means a\nnecessary link between forms in the case of the first type of formal\npredication; it means that the subject-thing in virtue of itself is\nnecessarily a member of a given class of objects, which the\npredicate-term of the proposition labels and refers to, in the case of\nthe second type of formal predication\u2014that is, when the\npredicate is a term of second intention.\n",
