    "main_text": "Falsafa: Neoplatonized Aristotelianism in the Islamic World || Time and Eternity\n2.5 Time and Eternity\n\nLike so many issues in natural philosophy, philosophers working in the\nfalsafa tradition took their lead concerning temporal topics\nfrom Aristotle. Thus most Arabic-speaking philosophers defined time as\nthe measure of motion with respect to priority and\n posteriority.[10]\n Although a number of the most discussed issues and problems\nassociated with time concerned the eternity of the world, and so in a\nsense belonged to metaphysics, there were some pressing questions\nconcerning the nature of time that remained wholly in the domain of\nnatural philosophy. Arguably the most important of these physical\nquestion concerned clarifying which motion or motions time measures.\nAverroes presented the problem at stake nicely in an extended\ndigression his Long Commentary on the Physics (Averroes 1962,\n178F-179I).\n\nAverroes began by asking whether time is associated with every motion\nor just one special motion. If time were associated with, and indeed\ngenerated by, every motion, then there would be as many times as there\nwere motions, and yet it seems immediately obvious that there is but a\nsingle time. Thus it would seem that time must be associated with just\none special motion; and indeed virtually everyone in the Aristotelian\ntradition, going back to at least Alexander of Aphrodisias, if not\nAristotle himself, did associate time with one special motion, namely,\nthe motion of the heavens. Now, continued Averroes, if time were\nuniquely associated with this and only this motion, then one\u2019s sensing\nand being aware of time would be associated with one\u2019s sensing and\nbeing aware of the heavens\u2019 motion. Consequently, should someone have\nnever sensed that motion, such as Plato\u2019s prisoners in the cave from\nthe Republic, that person would be wholly unaware of time,\nand such a conclusion simply seems false. In fact, Averroes\ngeneralized his argument to include all special motions that exist\noutside of our souls. Hence it would seem that the motion in question\nin the definition of time must refer to a psychological motion, that\nis, some motion that our souls undergo. The difficulty with this\nsuggestion, Averroes concluded, is twofold: first, it implies that\nthere is no time outside the soul, and second, since there will be as\nmany psychological motions as there are souls, we have returned to our\ninitial difficulty of the existence of multiple times.\n\nAverroes\u2019 solution is to say that our awareness of time is first and\nessentially our awareness of ourselves inasmuch as we have undergone\nsome sort of change. We are in turn aware that we have undergone some\nsort of change by being aware of two different moments, as for\nexample, I am aware that the moment at which I first began to write\nthis account is different from the present moment, in which case I am\naware that I have undergone some sort of change. Our undergoing\nchange, however, Averroes quickly added, only results from the\nheavens\u2019 undergoing motion, and should per impossibile the\nheavens cease moving, then we would no longer undergo change.\nConsequently, although our awareness of time is associated immediately\nwith our undergoing change, and so we can be aware of time even though\nwe are not aware of any particular extra-mental motion, time itself is\nassociated with the motion of the heavens that is the ultimate cause\nof our undergoing motion, and so time is one and not multiplied.\n\nAnother temporal issue that was clearly of interest to natural\nphilosophers in Islamic lands concerned time\u2019s topography: \u201cIs\nit finite or infinite?\u201d and \u201cIs it\n\u2018rectilinear\u2019 or \u2018cyclical\u2019?\u201d Among the\nArabic-speaking philosophers, al-Kind\u012b was virtually alone in\naffirming the finitude of time; most others philosophers argued that\ntime must necessarily be infinite in that it could have no beginning.\nHow various philosophers argued for this thesis reveals that both\nrectilinear and cyclical conceptions of time were present within the\nfalsafa tradition, where Avicenna advocates a rectilinear\nconception of time and Averroes a cyclical conception of time.\n\nAgain the area where this issue arose concerned proofs for the\neternity of time. So, for example, in a novel proof for the existence\nof time based upon differences in the amount of distance that can be\ncovered by slower and faster moving objects, Avicenna linked time with\na possibility or capacity (imk7amacr;n) for motion (Avicenna 1985,\n228\u2013229). He then argued by means of a reducto ad\nabsurdum. He has us assume that time is finite, and so the motion\nof the universe must have some first moment when it began. Even if the\nmotion of the universe began at some first moment, the argument\ncontinues, clearly there would still have been the possibility for the\nCreator of the world to make a motion that extended further back. In\nthat case, there is a capacity or possibility for motion that precedes\nthe purported first moment, but time according to Avicenna is again\njust a certain capacity or possibility for motion. Thus a time would\nhave preceded the purported first moment, which is absurd. Since the\nsame argument applies to any purported first moment of time, concluded\nAvicenna, time can have no beginning and so must be infinite. Clearly,\nthe conception of time implicit in Avicenna\u2019s argument is that of a\ntemporal line stretching back infinitely.\n\nAverroes too provided an argument for time\u2019s having no beginning, but\nnow in terms of conceiving time as a circle (Averroes 1991, question\nIII). As was explained above, for Averroes time is a consequence and\nmeasure of the circular motion of the heavens and so is itself\ncircular. Now just as any point on a circle is both a beginning and\nending of some arc on the circle, so any moment assumed in time must\nbe a beginning and ending of some period of time. Consequently time\nhas no beginning. That it should have no beginning, however, is not in\nthe sense that a straight line has no beginning, but in the sense that\nno point on a circle can be said to be the beginning of the circle.\nAlthough Averroes did not explicitly claim that all events and thing\nwill come around again, his argument does seem to imply such a\nconclusion.\n",
