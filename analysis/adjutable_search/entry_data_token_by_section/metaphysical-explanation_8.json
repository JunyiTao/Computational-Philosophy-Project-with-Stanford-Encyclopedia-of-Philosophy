    "main_text": "Models of metaphysical explanation || Metaphysical explanation as explanation by unification\n6.3 Metaphysical explanation as explanation by unification\n\nUnificationism is a view of scientific explanation that, although it\nbuilds on some of the insights of the classic DN-model, extends and\nrefines that model by focusing, not on individual arguments, but on\nthose argument patterns which best unify the relevant phenomena. Its\ncore idea is that to explain is to derive as many conclusions as\npossible from as few premises as possible, using as few and as\nstringent argument patterns as possible. The fewer patterns used, the\nhigher the stringency. The greater the range of conclusions derived,\nthe greater the unification. The account (inspired by Friedman 1974)\nwas first developed by Kitcher (1981, 1989). For a good overview, see\nthe entry on\n scientific explanation (\u00a75).\n\nIn metaphysics, an account of explanation along something like these\nlines can (as noted by Roski 2019) be found already in the work of\nBolzano. Recent attempts to adapt Kitcher\u2019s model to suit\nmetaphysical and not just scientific explanation include Kovacs (2020)\nand Baron & Norton (2021) (see Bertrand 2019 for an account that,\nalthough not couched in terms of unification, has a lot in common with\ntheir views).\n\nA unificationist account of metaphysical explanation is an account\naccording to which such explanations aim to unify the beliefs\nimplicated in metaphysical theorizing. On this view, roughly speaking,\na particular derivation is a metaphysical explanation just in case it\nis an instance of an argument pattern that unifies metaphysical\nbeliefs. Several things can be said in favor of this view. If you are\nno fan of grounding, the fact that it takes metaphysical explanation\nto be something completely independent of whatever determinative\n(grounding) relations there happen to be (or not), will count as a big\npoint in its favor. Another positive is the fact that it is an account\nof metaphysical explanation that makes unusually good sense of the\nlink between explanation and understanding. Unificationism corresponds\nto an intuitive way of thinking about understanding: we understand\nbetter when we can derive large amounts of information from a fairly\nsmall number of premises and a small number of argument patterns. This\nis because the ability to do so suggests an ability to identify\nconnections between things; to fit things together. Yet the resulting\naccount is not (just) psychological. As Friedman points out,\nexplanatoriness remains in an important sense objective if \u201cwhat\nis scientifically comprehensible is constant for a relatively large\nclass of people\u201d (1974: 7\u20138).\n\nFor those who think of metaphysical explanation as an entirely\nobjective and worldly affair the account will however remain highly\nunattractive. Indeed, even those who think of metaphysical explanation\nas partly representational\u2014the so-called separatists\u2014will\nmost likely not find it very appealing. Note, though, that some think\nthat metaphysical explanation can be either unificationist or\nunderstood in terms of grounding (Bertrand 2019 is one example). If\nso, although metaphysical explanation will become a less unified\nphenomenon, the fact that it can make sense of both what Bertrand\n(inspired by Salmon 2006) calls \u201ctop-down\u201d and\n\u201cbottom-up\u201d metaphysical explanation, should perhaps count\nas a point in its favor.\n\nSome further objections to the account\u2014including, among other\nthings, the question of what should count as the best\nsystematization; if understanding metaphysical explanation in\nunificationist terms means having to give up on the \u201cimpure\nlogic\u201d of such explanations, and; if given unificationism,\nlogical truths will lack metaphysical explanation\u2014are discussed\n(and ultimately rejected) in Kovacs (2020). A classic objection to the\nunificationist account of causal explanation, finally, is that it,\njust like its close cousin the DN-account (see\n \u00a76.2),\n fails to make sense of the asymmetry of such explanations, at least\nnot without assuming causal realism. A similar objection may well be\navailable to those who combine unificationism and anti-realism about\nmetaphysical explanation. \n",
