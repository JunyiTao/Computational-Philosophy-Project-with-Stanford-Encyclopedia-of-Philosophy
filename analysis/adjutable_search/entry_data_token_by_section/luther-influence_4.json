    "main_text": "Luther, Heidegger, and L\u00f8gstrup\n5. Luther, Heidegger, and L\u00f8gstrup\n\nWhile the other major twentieth century figures to engage with Luther\nwere primarily theologians (such as Rudolf Bultmann (1884\u20131976),\nKarl Barth (1886\u20131968), Paul Tillich (1886\u20131965) and\nFriedrich Gogarten (1887\u20131967)), one significant philosopher in\nthis period to often be associated with Luther is Martin Heidegger\n(1889\u20131976). Raised originally as a Catholic and aspiring\ninitially to be a Catholic philosopher, after the First World War\nHeidegger shifted his allegiances and began to engage seriously with\nLuther\u2019s works, as well as with Augustine, Schleiermacher, and\nKierkegaard, though ultimately he was to break with theism and\nChristianity altogether. In this period in the 1920s, Heidegger took\nup Luther\u2019s distinction between the \u201ctheology of\nglory\u201d and the \u201ctheology of the cross\u201d, and argued\nthat original or \u201cprimordial\u201d Christianity\n(Urchristentum) had been distorted into the former by an\n\u201contotheology\u201d wrongly influenced by the scholastic\nmisappropriation of Aristotle; this now needed to be overturned in a\nway that was yet more radical than Luther himself, to avoid what\nHeidegger saw as the \u201cProtestant scholasticism\u201d of\nLuther\u2019s later period and that of his followers. It can also be\nsaid that what he perceived as Luther\u2019s struggle provided the\ninspiration for Heidegger\u2019s own attempts to overturn the\nmetaphysical tradition within philosophy. However, with the\npublication of Being and Time in 1927, this connection to\nLuther becomes obscured in the wake of other allegiances, and Luther\nis hardly mentioned in this text, though it can still be argued that\ncertain Lutheran assumptions remain throughout this and later\nworks\u2014such that one commentator has called Being and\nTime a \u201cLutheran phenomenology of Dasein\u201d (McGrath\n2006:\n 12).[38]\n\nLuther also plays a significant role in the thought of the Danish\nphilosopher and theologian K. E. L\u00f8gstrup (1905\u20131981),\nwho interacted with Heidegger and Bultmann both before and after the\nSecond World War, as well as with contemporary Kierkegaardians in\nDenmark. L\u00f8gstrup used Luther to develop his own distinctive\nnatural law position in ethics, while also incorporating in his ethics\nthe fundamental Lutheran view that goodness is not achievable through\nour own efforts; but for L\u00f8gstrup, this goodness is brought\nabout through the encounter with another person that is made possible\nthrough life itself, rather than divine grace, thereby secularizing\nthis central aspect of the Lutheran position. At the same time, he\nallows that the very fact that life makes this possible may suggest\nthat it is created. L\u00f8gstrup argued, moreover, that forgiveness\nmust remain a theological matter, as our sinfulness means that human\nbeings are in no position to forgive each other with any kind of\nauthority, in this way retaining an important element of\nLuther\u2019s theology of the cross.\n",
