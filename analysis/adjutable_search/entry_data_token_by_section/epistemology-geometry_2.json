That is, it takes the straightness of the straight\nline and the flatness of the plane as fundamental, and appeals to the\nincidence properties just described. It is resistant to the idea of\ntaking distance as a fundamental concept, or to the idea of replacing\nstatements in geometry by statements about numbers (say, as\ncoordinates), although it is not hostile to coordinate geometry being\nerected upon it.\n\nLet us also say for present purposes that a metrical geometry is one\nin which distance is a primitive concept, so line segments can be said\nto have the same length, congruent figures have corresponding sides\nequal in length, and geometrical transformations preserve lengths. We\ncan also allow that similarities are allowed: these are\ntransformations that produce scale copies of figures. (No theorem in\nEuclid\u2019s Elements depends on the actual size of a\nfigure: any theorem that applies to one figure applies to all its\nscale copies.)\n\nElementary geometry in the modern West moved in a confused way towards\nmaking distance the primary primitive concept, while often maintaining\nthe Euclidean emphasis on straightness, thus frequently muddling the\nimplications of the different concepts. A notable example of this\nbeing nonetheless productive was John Wallis\u2019s argument in\ndefence of the parallel postulate (given as a lecture in 1665 and\npublished in Wallis 1693). It rested, as he realised, on the ability\nto make arbitrary scale copies of a triangle, and this seems to be the\nfirst time that the equivalence was recognised between these two\nsystems:\n\nEuclid\u2019s Elements with the parallel postulate\nEuclid\u2019s Elements without that postulate but with\nthe assumption that arbitrary similar figures exist added.\n\n\nIn the Encylop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique (1784: vol. 2,\n132), d\u2019Alembert defined geometry as the science of the\nproperties of extension, i.e., of bodies (and surfaces and lines)\nconsidered as merely extended and figured. Its principles are founded,\nin his view, on truths so evident that it is not possible to contest\nthem. A line (in the sense of a curve) is one-dimensional, and the\nshortest line joining two points is the straight line. Parallel lines\nare lines that, however far they are extended, will never meet because\nthey are everywhere equidistant. D'Alembert was not keen on\naxiomatic presentation of the material, and so it was also with many\nother eighteenth-century authors.\n\nAdrien-Marie Legendre was a mathematician sympathetic to the didactic\naims of the Elements but not to its original formulations. He\nwrote several different versions of his \u00c9l\u00e9ments de\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie (1794) with a view to restoring\n\"Euclidean rigour\" in the teaching of geometry, which in his\nview had been corroded by texts, such as one by Clairaut (1741), that\nrelied on notions of self-evidence. They differ largely, as he had to\nadmit, in their unsuccessful attempts to deduce the parallel\npostulate.\n\nIn all these editions Legendre took a firmly metrical point of view,\ntaking as given algebra and the theory of proportions. His opening\ndefinition of the first edition proclaimed that \u201cGeometry is a\nscience that has as its object the measure of extent\u201d. Extent,\nhe explained, has three dimensions, length, breadth, and height; a\nline is a length without breadth, its extremities are called points\nand a point therefore has no extent. A straight line is the shortest\npath from one point to another; surfaces have length and breadth but\nno height or depth; and a plane is a surface in which if two arbitrary\npoints are joined by a straight line this line lies entirely in the\nsurface. Legendre then set out to prove even some truths that Euclid\nhad preferred to assume, such as (Legendre\u2019s first result): any\ntwo right angles are equal. The notion of congruence was central to\nhis approach, and familiar congruence theorems follow in each edition\nuntil the parallel postulate could no longer be ignored. Once the\nexistence of parallel lines was assured Legendre argued that they were\nequidistant.\n\nIn fact, Legendre\u2019s attempts to restore rigour to the treatment\nof elementary geometry was no better than Euclid\u2019s, and in some\nways worse, not only because his attempts to prove the parallel\npostulate inevitably failed, but because he smuggled more into his\naccount than he realised. But its chief significance for present\npurposes is that it exemplifies the attempt to ground elementary\ngeometry on a concept of distance, or more precisely, on the idea that\na straight line is the curve of shortest distance between any of its\npoints. Distance itself is not defined.\n\nJoseph Fourier, in a discussion with Monge, also took the concept of\ndistance as fundamental, and began with three-dimensional space. He\nthen employed equidistance to define successively the sphere, the\nplane (as the points equidistant from two given points) and the line\n(as the points equidistant from three given points). This did at least\ngive him definitions of these previously troubling concepts (see\nBonola 1912, 54).\n\nTo conclude: a reasonable view at the time would have been that\nmetrical geometry needed to put its house in order, and it probably\ncould not do so by grafting the concept of distance onto a structure\nmodelled on Euclid\u2019s Elements. This is an awkward\nposition for traditional geometry to be in, and it may have opened\npeople\u2019s minds to the possibilities of alternatives. Certainly,\ntwo were to be produced. One, projective geometry, amplified and\nimproved the synthetic side of geometry. The other, non-Euclidean\ngeometry, was a new and challenging metrical geometry. But before we\nlook at them, we turn to contemporary philosophical discussions of\ngeometry.\n",
