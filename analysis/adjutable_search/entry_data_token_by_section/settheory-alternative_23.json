    "main_text": "Logically and Philosophically Motivated Variations || The multiverse view of set theory\n8.3 The multiverse view of set theory\n\nWe examine the theory of the set theoretic multiverse proposed by Joel\nDavid Hamkins, whose purpose is to address philosophical questions\nabout independence questions in standard set theory, but which when\nspelled out formally has some of the flavor of an alternative set\ntheory. A set theoretic Platonist might say about the Continuum\nHypothesis (CH) that, since there is \u201cof course\u201d\na single universe of sets, CH is either true or false in that\nworld, but that we cannot determine which of CH and\n\\(\\neg\\)CH actually holds. Hamkins proposes as an alternative\n(taking the same realist standpoint as the classical Platonist, it\nmust be noted) that there are many distinct concepts of set, which we\nmay suppose for the moment all satisfy the usual axioms of\nZFC, each concept determining its own universe of sets, and\nin some of these universes CH holds and in some it does not\nhold. He says further, provocatively, that in his view CH is\na solved problem, because we have an excellent understanding of the\nconditions under which CH holds in \\(a\\) universe of sets\n(note the article used) and the conditions in which it does not hold,\nand even more provocatively, he argues that an \u201cideal\u201d\nsolution to the CH problem in which a generally accepted\naxiom arises which causes most mathematicians to conclude that\nCH is \u201cself-evidently\u201d true or false (deciding\nthe question in the usual sense) is now actually impossible, because\nset theorists are now very conversant with universes in which both\nalternatives hold, and understand very well that neither alternative\nis \u201cself-evidently\u201d true (the force of his argument is\nreally that the complementary conclusion that one of the alternatives\nis self-evidently false is now impossible to draw, because we are too\nwell acquainted with actual \u201cworlds\u201d in which each\nalternative holds to believe that either is absurd).\n\nWe could write an entire essay on questions raised in our summary in\nthe previous paragraph, but Hamkins has already done this in Hamkins\n2012. Our aim here is to summarize the tentative axioms that Hamkins\npresents for the multiverse conception. This is not really a formal\nset of axioms, but it does have some of the qualities of an\naxiomatization of an alternative set theory. We note that the list of\naxioms presented here unavoidably presupposes more knowledge of\nadvanced set theory than other parts of this article.\n\n\nRealizability Principle: For any universe \\(V\\), if\n\\(W\\) is a model of set theory and definable or interpreted in \\(V\\),\nthen \\(W\\) is a universe.\n\n\nOne thing to note here is that Hamkins is open to the idea that some\nuniverses may be models of theories other than ZFC (weaker\ntheories such as Zermelo set theory or Peano arithmetic, or even\ndifferent theories such as ZFA or NF/NFU). But it\nappears to be difficult philosophically to articulate exact boundaries\nfor what counts as a \u201cconcept of set theory\u201d which would\ndefine a universe. And this is fine, because there is no notion of\n\u201cthe multiverse\u201d of universes as a completed totality here\nat all\u2014this would amount to smuggling in the single Platonic\nuniverse again through the back door! Some of the axioms which follow\ndo presume that the universes discussed are models of ZFC or\nvery similar theories.\n\n\nForcing Extension Principle: For any universe \\(V\\)\nand any forcing notion \\(P\\) in \\(V\\), there is a forcing extension\n\\(V[G]\\), where \\(G \\subset P\\) is \\(V\\)-generic.\n\n\nThis asserts that our forcing extensions are concretely real worlds.\nHamkins discusses the metaphysical difficulties of the status of\nforcing extensions at length in Hamkins 2012.\n\n\nReflection Axiom: For every universe \\(V\\), there is\na much taller universe \\(W\\) with an ordinal \\(\\theta\\) for which\n\\(V\\) is elementarily equivalent to (or isomorphic to) \\(W_{\\theta}\\),\na level of the cumulative hierarchy in \\(W\\).\n\n\nWe quote Hamkins:\n\n\nthe principle asserts that no universe is correct about the height of\nthe ordinals, and every universe looks like an initial segment of a\nmuch taller universe having the same truths. (2012: 438)\n\n\nHere we are presuming that the universes we are talking about are\nmodels of ZFC or a ZFC-like theory.\n\n\nCountability Principle: Every universe \\(V\\) is\ncountable from the perspective of another, better universe \\(W\\).\n\n\nThis definitely has the flavor of an alternative set theory axiom! The\nmodel theoretic motivation is obvious: this amounts to taking\nSkolem\u2019s paradox seriously. Hamkins notes that the Forcing\nExtension principle above already implies this, but it is clear in any\ncase that his list of tentative axioms is intended to be neither\nindependent nor complete.\n\n\nWell-foundedness Mirage: Every universe \\(V\\) is\nill-founded from the perspective of another, better universe.\n\n\nHamkins says that this may be the most provocative of all his axioms.\nHe states that he intends this to imply that even our notion of\nnatural numbers is defective in any universe: the collection of\nnatural numbers as defined in any universe is seen to contain\nnonstandard elements from the standpoint of a further universe.\n\n\nReverse Embedding Axiom: For every universe \\(V\\) and\nevery embedding \\(j : V \\rightarrow M\\) in \\(V\\), there is a universe\n\\(W\\) and embedding \\(h: W \\rightarrow V\\) such that \\(j\\) is the\niterate of \\(h\\).\n\n\nWe merely quote this astonishing assertion, which says that for any\nelementary embedding of a universe \\(V\\) into a model \\(M\\) included\nin \\(V\\), our understanding of this embedding locally to \\(V\\) itself\nis seriously incomplete.\n\n\nAbsorption into L: Every universe \\(V\\) is a\ncountable transitive model in another universe \\(W\\) satisfying \\(V =\nL\\).\n\n\nWe are used to thinking of the constructible universe \\(L\\) as a\n\u201crestricted\u201d universe. Here Hamkins turns this inside out\n(he discusses at length why this is a reasonable way to think in the\npaper Hamkins 2012).\n\nWe leave it to the reader who is interested to pursue this\nfurther.\n",
