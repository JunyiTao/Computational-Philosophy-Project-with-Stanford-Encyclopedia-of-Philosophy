Those who argue for a\nHebrew original point to another phrase, this time by Claudio Tolemei\n(1492\u20131556), a non-Jew, which states that Judah composed his treatise\nin sua lingua (\u201chis own language\u201d). \nAlthough, as others have pointed out, such a phrase could quite easily\nrefer to \u201chis own style.\u201d\n\n\nHowever, given the evidence, an Italian original for the work seems\nmost likely since (1) all the manuscripts, including Mariano\nLenzi\u2019s edition of 1535, are in Italian; (2) it seems that Judah\nhad lived in Italy for close to twenty years by the time that he wrote\nthe Dialoghi (more than enough time for someone to gain an\nintimate knowledge of Italian, especially someone proficient in Latin\nand Spanish vernaculars); (3) neither later Jewish authors, e.g.,\nAzaria \n de\u2019Rossi,[9]\n nor non-Jewish authors, e.g., Tullia\n d\u2019Aragona,[10]\nhad any reason to suspect that it was written in a language other than\nItalian; (4) if we assume the later date of 1511\u20131512, many non-Tuscan\nItalian authors of this period called for the adoption of Tuscan as a\nliterary language, owing primarily to the fact that this was the\nlanguage of Petrarch (1304\u20131374) and Boccaccio\n (1313\u20131375);[11]\n and, (5) as for the\nquestion of the Tuscan dialect of the work, many Italian printers of\nthe early sixteenth century \u201cTuscanized\u201d Italian according\nto set\n criteria.[12]\n\n\nMoreover, many Jewish authors in the fifteenth- and\nsixteenth-centuries increasingly resorted to Romance vernaculars in\norder to attract a Jewish audience (including conversos and\nex-conversos), which no longer understood Hebrew. In\nsixteenth-century Italy, larger trends in rhetoric and the use of\nlanguage increasingly led to the creation of the ideal of a pure\nItalian language. In this regard, Judah becomes an important\ntransitional thinker in the encounter between Judaism and the Italian\nRenaissance. Whereas his father, Don Isaac, could still adapt\nhumanistic themes to his Hebrew writings, which were still primarily in\nconversation with medieval\n thought,[13]\n increasingly in Judah\u2019s generation the only way\nto engage in a full-scale examination of the universal tendencies\nassociated with Humanism was to write in the vernacular.\n\n\nFinally, the very genre of the Dialoghi, that of the\ntrattato d\u2019amore (\u201ctreatise on love\u201d), was\nthe product of the Italian vernacular of the late fifteenth and early\nsixteenth centuries. When, for example, Judah discusses the\nconcept of love as a universal or cosmic principle he draws upon, as\nwill be clearer below, a particular vocabulary and set of concepts that\nonly make sense when contextualized within this already\n existing\n discourse.[14]\n",
