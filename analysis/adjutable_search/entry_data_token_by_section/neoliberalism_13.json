    "main_text": "Criticisms of Neoliberalism || Undermining Democracy\n7.3 Undermining Democracy\n\nA very common criticism of neoliberalism is that it undermines\ndemocracy. This might be because high economic inequality undermines\ndemocracy, as Martin Gilens (2014) argues in Affluence and\nInfluence and defended by Larry Bartels (2008 [2016]). Another\nway in which neoliberalism could undermine democracy is by\nprioritizing the protection of classical liberal economic liberties,\nlike the right to private property. These can lead to restrictions on\nthe ability of democratic citizens to choose to redistribute wealth.\nThis problem is especially acute given Hayek\u2019s favorable view of\nthe Pinochet regime in Chile. Hayek hoped that Chile would become a\ndemocracy, but he believed that the Pinochet coup had allowed Chile to\ndodge the bullet of democratic socialism as advocated by Salvador\nAllende, Pinochet\u2019s predecessor. There is a tension between the\nliberalism and the democratic commitments within neoliberalism that in\npractice tends to mean that democracy suffers.\n7.4. Economic Irrationality\n\nNeoliberal regimes rely heavily on market mechanisms, and neoliberals\nclaim that markets are efficient or at least highly economically\nproductive (neoliberals disagree about how to characterize and explain\nmarket productivity and efficiency). But behavioral economists\n(Kahneman 2013; Ariely 2010) have identified various biases in human\nreasoning that undermine the homo economicus model that\nneoliberals are said to use to model and predict economic development\n(though as shown above, neoliberals have a subtler relationship with\nhomo economicus). See entry on\n bounded rationality.\n7.5 Keynesian Rebuttals\n\nNeoliberalism, as noted, arose in part in response to the dominance of\nKeynesian macro-economic policy. But Keynesians, most notably Paul\nKrugman (2012), have struck back by arguing that neoliberal criticisms\nof Keynesian policy fail. This is especially true because neoliberals\noften claimed that fiscal policy is ineffective stimulus\nvis-\u00e0-vis monetary stimulus. During the Great Recession,\nKrugman argued that the Federal Reserve had lowered interest rates so\nmuch that further monetary stimulus would fail, and so fiscal policy\nhad to intervene.\n\nMany of the criticisms of neoliberal regimes engaging in\n\u201causterity\u201d during the Great Recession are based in an\nunderlying Keynesian model, as the critics of government spending cuts\nduring the Great Recession were often based on the idea that they hurt\nthe economic prospects of the poor, whereas according to neoliberals,\nshrinking government spending during a recession is not harmful to the\npoor for a variety of reasons. See entry on\n philosophy of economics.\n7.6 Trickle-Down Economics\n\nOne common charge against neoliberalism is its false promise of\n\u201ctrickle-down\u201d benefits of economic growth to the poor\nfrom the rich (Quiggin 2012). Strictly speaking, trickle-down\neconomics is not a genuine school of economic thought, nor would\nHayek, Friedman, or Buchanan have accepted that description of their\nviews. They did argue that all would benefit from the prosperity\nbrought about through the free market, but this was not necessarily\nbecause the rich would benefit first. Hayek (1960 [2011]) argued that\nthere is a kind of trickle-down effect for the prices of goods and\nservices, where luxuries for the rich become commonalities for the\npoor because manufacturers figure out how to lower prices to broaden\nmarket penetration over time. And indeed, it is standard in mainstream\neconomics to hold that as businesses accumulate capital, they can\nafford to pay their workers more and so can bid workers away from\nother companies. That process often involves increasing wages, so more\ncapital in the hands of the rich can lead to higher wages for\nthe poor through fairly ordinary causal channels. All the same, many\nneoliberal officials promised gains for the poor that did not often\nmaterialize.\n7.7 Libertarian Criticisms\n\nNeoliberalism and libertarianism are distinct, if related views. And\nin some respects, the neoliberals were libertarian under some\nconditions. Indeed, Buchanan thought anarchy was the morally best\nregime, even if it was infeasible in practice. But it is still common\nfor libertarians to criticize more moderate libertarians for allowing\nany redistribution of wealth, such as Murray Rothbard (1973, 1982\n[2002]), Robert Nozick (1974), or for prioritizing democracy over more\nepistocratic or elite-leaning forms of political decision-making, such\nas Jason Brennan (2016).\n7.8 Colonialist Criticisms\n\nIt is common in some circles to argue that neoliberal regimes are\ncolonialist in character, though in an unusually direct way. The\nthought is that neoliberalism was adopted by regimes in the Anglophone\nworld and in much of Western Europe, and that this formed an\ninternational elite consensus about how economies around the world\nshould be run. This led to a \u201cWashington Consensus\u201d that\ncaused policy interventions that interfered with the democratic\ngovernance of developing nations, increased inequality, and made the\npoor worse off. For comprehensive discussion, see Whyte (2019:\nchapters 3\u20135).\n7.9 Populist/Nationalist Criticisms\n\nIt is increasingly common for right-wing populists to criticize\nneoliberal policy on the grounds that it emphasizes free trade and\nfree immigration lead to a range of deleterious consequences, from the\nshrinking of the industrial base of rich democratic countries like the\nUnited States, such as that advanced by Patrick Deneen (2019). A\nstronger form of this concern is that allowing immigrants from\ndifferent cultures to acquire citizenship within a country will harm\nor degrade the culture and politics of that country.\n7.10 Feminist Criticisms\n\nSome, like Nancy Fraser (2017), worry that neoliberalism has co-opted\nfeminism by making the feminist ideal into one that serves as a kind\nof false market-based meritocracy, where the aim of feminism is, for\ninstance, that woman who has well-paying career, and at its highest\nideal, female entrepreneurship and becoming CEOs of a company. This\nleft feminism unable to attend to the needs and interests of women who\nneoliberalism has harmed. See entry on\n feminist perspectives on globalization.\n7.11 Remaining Criticisms\n\nNeoliberalism is subject to other objections, but many resemble\nproblems for other liberal democratic theories, such as the conflict\nbetween liberal rights (however understood) and democracy\u2014the\n\u201cprocedure-substance\u201d dispute in the deliberative\ndemocracy literature, as well as how any sufficiently liberal approach\nto associational freedom takes the freedom of marginalized groups\nseriously given the prospect for local oppression. Neoliberals have\ndiverse conceptions of freedom, though typically negative, with all\nthe standard criticisms those views invite. And, then, to the extent\nthat neoliberalism like Hayek and Buchanan adopt a contractarian\nframework for justifying institutions, their defenses will inherit all\nthe difficulties with contractarianism.\n8. Summary\n\nThis entry is not meant to determine the one true meaning of\n\u201cneoliberalism\u201d, but rather to illuminate neoliberalism as\na coherent philosophical doctrine embraced by figures commonly called\nneoliberals. The entry also prioritizes more even-handed and less\npejorative uses of the term in recent historical research. This is not\nto discount more historical and dynamic understandings of\nneoliberalism. They contain insight. But the goal of this entry has\nbeen to characterize neoliberalism as a philosophical position. If we\ndo so, we can understand neoliberalism as a politico-economic doctrine\nthat embraces robust liberal capitalism, constitutional democracy, and\na modest welfare\n state.[11]",
