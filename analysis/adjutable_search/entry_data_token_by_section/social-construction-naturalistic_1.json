    "main_text": "What is Social Construction? || What Constructs?\n1.1 What Constructs?\n\nWhile philosophers have carefully engaged various constructionist\nclaims over the last several decades, much of the attention has been\npaid to various objects of construction (e.g., ideas? knowledge?\nfacts? human nature?). In contrast, comparatively little attention has\nbeen paid to distinguishing different sorts of agents of construction.\nMany of the agents in social constructionist claims can be neatly\ndivided into two groups: those that view the agents as primarily\nimpersonal agents, and those that view the agents as\npersonal agents (i.e., persons or groups).\n\nWork in the first group emphasizes a causal role for impersonal causes\nlike cultures, conventions, or institutions in producing some\nphenomenon. For example, the claim that what we perceive is determined\nby our background theories emphasizes an impersonal causal\nagent\u2014culture\u2014in determining some phenomena. Perhaps the\nmost influential version of this claim came in Thomas Kuhn\u2019s\nsuggestion that, \u201cwhat a man sees depends both upon what he\nlooks at and also upon what his previous visual-conceptual experience\nhas taught him to see\u201d (1962/1970, 113), a suggestion with some\nfoundation in \u201cNew Look \u201d psychology (e.g. Briner,\nPostman, and Rodrigues 1951). This view was subsequently taken up by a\nrange of other authors across disciplines. For example, the historian\nThomas Laqueur writes that, \u201cpowerful prior notions of\ndifference or sameness determine what one sees and reports about the\nbody\u201d (1990,\n 21).[1]\n Provocative claims like Kuhn\u2019s and Laqueur\u2019s suggest that\nperception is so dependent upon the background theories that the\nobservational data becomes compromised as an independent constraint on\nempirical inquiry. Impersonal cultural accounts of construction are\nalso found in explanations of nonrepresentational phenomena, for\nexample, of sex-differentiated behavior. Here a core claim might admit\nthat there is sex difference, but claim that the cause of difference\nis rooted in different conceptions of sex (and the practices caused by\nthose conceptions) rather than biological facts (see\n Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender).\n\nA second group of constructionist claims emphasizes personal\nsocial agents that construct through their choices. For example,\nAndrew Pickering\u2019s (1984) influential work Constructing\nQuarks emphasizes the role of scientists\u2019 judgments in a\nvariety of roles in scientific process including, e.g., theory\nselection, experiment evaluation, assessments of research fecundity,\nand so forth, and such an emphasis on apparently highly contingent\nchoices by researchers and scientific institutions is a mainstay of\nthe social studies of knowledge literature. In emphasizing personal\nchoices, some constructionist work (including some of\nPickering\u2019s) seems primarily aimed at emphasizing the\ncontingency of the scientific theory that we come to accept (cf.\nHacking\n 1999).[2]\n Other constructionists\u2014those we might call critical\nconstructionists\u2014emphasize personal choices not just to\nestablish the contingency of the acceptance of some representation as\nto emphasize the role of an agent\u2019s interests or power relations\nin determining the content of an accepted representation. For example,\nCharles Mills suggests that the borders of American racial categories\nwere determined in such a way as to \u201cestablish and maintain the\nprivileges of different groups. So, for example, the motivation for\nusing the one-drop rule to determine black racial membership is to\nmaintain the subordination of the products of\n\u2018miscegenation\u2019\u201d (1998, 48). And a range of\nconstructionist research, especially research on human classifications\nlike \u201crace\u201d and \u201cgender,\u201d documents shifts in\nhuman classification in response to shifts of interests or power.\n",
