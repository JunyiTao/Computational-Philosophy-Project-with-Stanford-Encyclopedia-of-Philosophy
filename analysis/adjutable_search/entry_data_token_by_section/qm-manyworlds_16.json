    "main_text": "Objections to the MWI || Ockham\u2019s Razor\n6.1 Ockham\u2019s Razor\n\nIt seems that the preponderance of opposition to the MWI comes from\nthe introduction of a very large number of worlds that we do not see:\nthis looks like an extreme violation of Ockham\u2019s principle:\n\u201cEntities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity\u201d.\nHowever, in judging physical theories one could reasonably argue that\none should not multiply physical laws beyond necessity either (such a\nversion of Ockham\u2019s Razor has been applied in the past), and in\nthis respect the MWI is the most economical theory. Indeed, it has all\nthe laws of the standard quantum theory, but without the collapse\npostulate, which is the most problematic of the physical laws. The MWI\nis also more economical than Bohmian mechanics, which has in addition\nthe ontology of the particle trajectories and the laws which give\ntheir evolution. Tipler 1986a (p. 208) has presented an effective\nanalogy with the criticism of Copernican theory on the grounds of\nOckham\u2019s razor.\n\nOne might also consider a possible philosophical advantage of the\nplurality of worlds in the MWI, similar to that claimed by realists\nabout possible worlds, such as Lewis 1986 (see the discussion of the\nanalogy between the MWI and Lewis\u2019s theory by Skyrms 1976 and\nWilson 2020). However, the analogy is not complete: Lewis\u2019\ntheory considers all logically possible worlds, far more than all the\nworlds that are incorporated in the quantum state of the Universe.\n",
