    "main_text": "Literary Forms || Dialogue\n2.5 Dialogue\n\nThe classical source for medieval writers of dialogue should have been\nPlato; but Western writers had no direct access to Plato\u2019s\ndialogues, with the exception of the first half of the\nTimaeus. The number and diversity of dialogues from the\nmedieval period is, hence, surprising, with instances among the works\nof writers from Augustine to Ockham and Nicolas of Cusa, and across\ndifferent religious traditions. Though it has been argued that\ndialogue as a philosophical form dies off in late antiquity,\nespecially in the Christian tradition, this is clearly false in the\nmedieval period (Goldhill 2008, 5\u20138). Not only are philosophical\ndialogues plentiful but, perhaps because they were not overwhelmed by\nPlato as a model, medieval dialogue writers came up with many\nvariations on the form. While a good number use real or\nrealistically-described characters, there are also many where the\nparticipants are allegorical figures, like Boethius\u2019s Lady\nPhilosophy in the Consolatio or \u201cReason\u201d in\nAugustine\u2019s Soliloquies. A number of 12th century\nwriters also imitated more specifically the prosimetrum of\nBoethius\u2019s Consolation combining prose dialogue with\npoetry, exploring the hybrid of physical and spiritual in the cosmos\nand body and soul in human nature (Balint 2009). While some instances\nof this form, for example Boethius\u2019s commentary in dialogue form\non Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge, simply make use of the form as a\nvehicle for straightforward exposition, others make the dialogue form\nintrinsic to the argument. And while the standard form of a\nphilosophical dialogue is between a teacher and student figure, a\nnumber of medieval dialogues ignore this convention. Abelard\u2019s\nDialogue between a Philosopher, a Jew, and a Christian\n(Collationes), for example, traces a dispute between three\nequal partners, none of whom is the \u201cteacher\u201d whom the\nothers more or less meekly follow. Abelard\u2019s dialogue is\nessentially a dispute without a master to resolve it. Even if, as many\nscholars think, the dialogue is unfinished and Abelard meant to add a\nresolution of the dialogue in the form of a final adjudication by\nsomeone playing the role of master, it is noteworthy that, unlike in\nmost philosophical dialogues, the magisterial point of view is absent\nuntil the end rather than being the one that directs the\ndiscussion.\n\nOther dialogue writers like Gilbert Crispin, Petrus Alphonsi, Raymund\nLull, and Nicolas of Cusa also write dialogues in which the\nparticipants are representatives of the major religions: Christian,\nJew, Muslim, pagan, or philosopher. While some take care to give the\nvictory to the Christian, even transforming the other participants\ninto converts to Christianity, Gilbert, Petrus, Abelard, and Raymund\nLull all opt for subtler conclusions. Abelard\u2019s dialogue sets up\na \u201cjudge\u201d for the debate who never proffers a judgment.\nEven if Abelard had added this final judgment, the dialogue would\nstill not indicate a clear winner. Dialogue is a favorite form in the\ngrowing Adversos Iudaeos literature of the late 11th and 12th\ncenturies. And insofar as the dialogue form was especially prevalent\nin this period, it is part of a growing rationalism. Writers composing\ndialogues between Christian and Jewish (or pagan) spokesmen are at the\nsame time shifting the grounds of those arguments from proof texts\nfrom scripture to arguments grounded in the notion that the truths of\nthe faith were self-evident and could be convincing even to those not\nsharing common beliefs or authoritative texts (Cohen 1999,\n167\u2013218; Palm\u00e9n and Koskinen 2016). There are dialogues\nby Jewish thinkers in which philosophical and different religious\nperspectives debate, partially in response to Christian polemical\ndialogues, most famously Judah Halevi\u2019s dialogue known as the\nKuzari. The work is a dialogue between a pagan king, who\nspeaks as a philosopher, and a Jewish sage, and includes the\nappearance of representatives of Islam and Christianity working to\nconvert the king. Though the dialogue form continues to be used in the\nLatin West after the 12th century, its place as the form for\nrational argumentation is overtaken by the more formal and elaborate\nschool form of disputation in the 13th (Novikoff 2012, 341\u2013343,\n349).\n\nWhen the convention of composing a dialogue between a teacher and\nstudent is used, usually the author can be identified more or less\nwith the \u201cteacher.\u201d In Ibn Gabirol\u2019s (Avicenbron)\ndialogue, best known by its Latin title, Fons vitae, the\nstudent is mostly restricted to asking the teacher for explanations\nand demonstrations. Anselm\u2019s dialectical partner in Cur Deus\nHomo is the student Boso who as a Christian asks the questions\nthat a non-Christian monotheist would ask about the Incarnation.\nBoethius, however, casts himself as student rather than teacher in the\nConsolatio. Of those who compose dialogues between teacher\nand student a good number, such as those of Augustine, Eriugena,\nAnselm, Boethius, and Nicolas of Cusa expect and trace a conversion or\ntransformation in the \u201cstudent\u201d figure of the dialogue in\na way that Plato\u2019s dialogues do not. Anselm explicitly makes of\nhis interlocutor a partner in the dialogue who is supposed to\nanticipate conclusions and implications and/or who more truly\nmotivates the entire discussion (Sweeney 1999). Like Anselm, other\nmedieval dialogue writers play with the convention that the teacher\ntakes the lead in the discussion, in effect asking as well as\nanswering questions. In Eriugena\u2019s Periphyseon, it is\nsometimes the student, sometimes the teacher who moves the discussion\nforward. In William of Conches\u2019 dialogue, Dragmaticon\nphilosophiae, the \u2018Prince\u2019 asks questions of the\n\u2018philosopher\u2019 who represents William\u2019s views. In an\ninteresting variation, William of Ockham\u2019s Dialogus has\nthe student ask the questions while the teacher responds reluctantly\nand almost objectively without any attempt to transform or convert the\nstudent.\n\nThe variety of ways in which the dialogue form is taken up in the\nmedieval period alone is enough to make the form as such quite\ninteresting. In addition, as Jacobi points out, because the dialogue,\nunlike the disputation and commentary, is not a school form, it was\nalways taken up as a choice and with some degree of self-consciousness\non the part of the writer (Jacobi 1999, 10). They chose this form over\nsome other for a reason that affects the argument and the position\nthey take. (For bibliographical listings for some 160 dialogues\nwritten from the 4th century to the 15th as well as essays on the\ndialogues of 19 different medieval dialogue writers, see Jacobi\n1999.)\n\nGoldhill\u2019s contention that there is something in Christianity\ninhospitable to dialogue is literally false but gets at a more\ndifficult question about how and whether dissent is tolerated in\nmedieval Christianity, with parallel questions that have and should be\nasked about medieval Jewish and Muslim culture. (See below, sections 3\nand 4.) While neither medieval philosophical dialogues nor the forms\nof disputation which grew out of them can be reduced to catechism-like\nquestion and answer (Goldhill 2009, 5), it is a complex matter to\ndetermine whether the rational form of dialogue and disputation foster\nreal open discussion and dissent or control it within strict and\nnon-threatening limits. The same question could, of course, be\nmeaningfully asked about dialogue in antiquity, in non-Christian\nreligious traditions, and in the modern era. In an important sense, it\nis often too much rather than too little faith in reason in the Latin\nWest, expressed in medieval dialogue and disputation, which leads some\nto the notion that reason can prove the truth of Christianity over\nJudaism or Islam, and, then, to condemnation of resistance to\nChristianity as irrational (Cohen 1999; Sweeney 2012a,\n324\u20135).\n",
