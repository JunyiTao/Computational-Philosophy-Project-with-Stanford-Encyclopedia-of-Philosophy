    "main_text": "What Is It to Believe? || Interpretationism\n1.3 Interpretationism\n\nInterpretationism shares with dispositionalism the emphasis on\npatterns of action and reaction, rather than internal representational\nstructures, but retains the focus, abandoned by the liberal\ndispositionalist, on observable behavior\u2014behavior\ninterpretable by an outside observer. Since behavior is widely assumed\nto be physical, interpretationism can thus more easily be seen as\nadvancing the physicalist project. The two most prominent\ninterpretationists have been Dennett (1978, 1987, 1991) and Davidson\n(1984; see\n Donald Davidson;\n also see Lewis 1974; M\u00f6lder 2010; Curry 2020).\n\nTo gain a sense of Dennett\u2019s view, consider three different\nmethods we can use to predict the behavior of a human being. One\nmethod, which involves taking what Dennett calls the \u201cphysical\nstance\u201d, is to apply our knowledge of physical law. We can\npredict that a diver will trace a parabolic trajectory to the water\nbecause we know how objects of that mass and size behave in fall near\nthe surface of the Earth. A second method, which involves taking the\n\u201cdesign stance\u201d, is to attribute functions to the system\nor its parts and to predict that the system will function properly. We\ncan predict that a jogger\u2019s pulse will increase as she heads up\nthe hill because of what we know about exercise and the proper\nfunction of the circulatory system. A third method, which involves\ntaking the \u201cintentional stance\u201d, is to attribute beliefs\nand desires to the person, and then to predict that they will behave\nrationally, given those beliefs and desires. Much of our prediction of\nhuman behavior appears to involve such attribution (though see Andrews\n2012). Certainly, treating people as mere physical bodies or as\nbiological machines will not, as a practical matter, get us very far\nin predicting what is important to us.\n\nOn Dennett\u2019s view, a system with beliefs is a system whose\nbehavior, while complex and difficult to predict when viewed from the\nphysical or the design stance, falls into patterns that may be\ncaptured with relative simplicity and substantial if not perfect\naccuracy by means of the intentional stance. The system has the\nparticular belief that P if its behavior conforms to a\npattern that can be effectively captured by taking the intentional\nstance and attributing the belief that P. For example, we can\nsay that Heddy believes that a hurricane may be coming because\nattributing her that belief (along with other related beliefs and\ndesires) helps reveal the pattern, invisible from the physical and\ndesign stances, behind her boarding up her windows, making certain\nphone calls, stocking up provisions, etc. All there is to having\nbeliefs, according to Dennett, is embodying patterns of this sort.\nDennett acknowledges that his view has the unintuitive consequence\nthat a sufficiently sophisticated chess-playing machine would have\nbeliefs if its behavior is very complicated from the design stance\n(which would involve appeal to its programmed strategies) but\npredictable with relative accuracy and simplicity from the intentional\nstance (attributing the desire to defend its queen, the belief that\nyou won\u2019t sacrifice a rook for a pawn, etc.).\n\nDavidson also characterizes belief in terms of practices of belief\nattribution. He invites us to imagine encountering a being with a\nwholly unfamiliar language and then attempting the task of\nconstructing, from observation of the being\u2019s behavior in its\nenvironment, an understanding of that language (e.g., 1984, p.\n135\u2013137). Success in this enterprise would necessarily involve\nattributing beliefs and desires to the being in question, in light of\nwhich its utterances make sense. An entity with beliefs is a being for\nwhom such a project is practicable in principle\u2014a being that\nemits, or is disposed to emit, a complex pattern of behavior that can\nproductively be interpreted as linguistic, rational, and expressive of\nbeliefs and desires.\n\nDennett and Davidson both endorse the \u201cindeterminacy\u201d of\nbelief attributions: In at least some cases, multiple incompatible\ninterpretive schemes may be equally good, and thus there may be no\nfact of the matter which of those schemes is \u201creally\u201d the\ncorrect one, and thus whether the subject \u201creally\u201d\nbelieves P, if belief that P is attributed by one\nscheme but not by the other.\n",
