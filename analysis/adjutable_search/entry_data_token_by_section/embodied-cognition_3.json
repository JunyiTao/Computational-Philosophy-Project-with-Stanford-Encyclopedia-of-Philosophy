    "main_text": "Embodied Cognition: Themes and Close Relations\n2. Embodied Cognition: Themes and Close Relations\n\n\nUnlike computational cognitive science, the commitments of which can\nbe readily identified, embodied cognition is better characterized as a\nresearch program with no clear defining features other than the tenet\nthat computational cognitive science has failed to appreciate the\nbody\u2019s significance in cognitive processing and to do so requires\na dramatic re-conceptualization of the nature of cognition and how it\nmust be investigated. Different researchers view the body\u2019s\nsignificance for cognition as entailing different consequences for the\nsubject matter and practice of cognitive science. Nevertheless, through\nthis very broad diversity of views it is possible to extract three\nmajor themes around which discussion of embodied cognition can be\norganized (see Shapiro 2012; 2019a).\n",
