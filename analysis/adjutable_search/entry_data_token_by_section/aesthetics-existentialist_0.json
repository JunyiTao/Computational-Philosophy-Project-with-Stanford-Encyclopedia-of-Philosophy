Metaphysical foundations of existentialist aesthetics\n\n\nThe term \u201caesthetics\u201d as it first emerged in modern\nphilosophy (in A. G. Baumgarten\u2019s 1750 Aesthetica)\nencompassed the theory of perception, the theory of beauty and the\ntheory of art. This remained true of all classical philosophical\naesthetics in the late 18th and 19th centuries.\nIn this brand of aesthetics, the aesthetic moment is but one aspect of\nthe general theory of how humans perceive, know, and act in the world;\nthe theories of beauty and of artistic practice depend on the theories\nof perception, knowledge and judgement, and those in turn are premised\nupon more fundamental considerations regarding the nature of reality\nand our relationship to it. By contrast with the specialised aesthetic\ntheories developed in the last few decades, existentialist aesthetics\nis a continuation of this grand tradition. Existentialist aesthetics is\nintimately connected to certain metaphysical views, and it owes its\nrichness and consistency to the fact that it is part of a complex and\ncoherent philosophical system. Therefore we should begin by delineating\nthe most salient features of this metaphysical outlook.\n\n\nThe key insight that defines and unites existentialism as a\nphilosophical position, despite all the divergences between the authors\nincluded under that denomination, is the emphasis on the radical nature\nof human freedom, and the metaphysical and ontological imports of that\nfreedom. The metaphysical and ontological significance of freedom\nprecedes its moral, ethical, and political aspects, since the ways in\nwhich human beings \u201chook up\u201d to the world should be\nconsidered before issues of duty or justice. For existentialism, human\nfreedom grounds the very possibility of knowledge in its deepest form,\ni.e., the capacity of human beings to reveal something about reality. A\nChristian existentialist like Gabriel Marcel interprets the\nmetaphysical reach of human freedom in terms of the capacity and\nresponsibility of individuals to make themselves\n\u201cavailable\u201d to the mystery of their participation in\ncreation, in particular by responding to the appeal of the great\n\u201cThou\u201d (see in particular Marcel 1960b). Atheistic\nexistentialists (Camus, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty), on the\ncontrary, do not ground freedom in faith and the hope of accessing the\ntranscendent; instead they emphasise the difficulty of assuming that\nfreedom, since nothing can ensure that our attempts at finding meaning\nin the world will actually yield something objectively present in it.\nBut in all cases freedom is the ultimate ground of human beings\u2019\ncapacity to relate to the world.\n",
