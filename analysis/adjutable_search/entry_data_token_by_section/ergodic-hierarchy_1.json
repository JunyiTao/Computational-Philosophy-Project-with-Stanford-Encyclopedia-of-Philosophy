    "main_text": "Ergodicity\n2. Ergodicity\n\nWith these concepts in place, we can now define\n ergodicity.[7]\n A dynamical system \\([X, \\mu , T]\\) is ergodic iff\n\n\\[\nf^* = \\bar{f}\n\\]\n\n\nfor all complex-valued Lebesgue integrable functions \\(f\\) almost\neverywhere, meaning for almost all initial conditions. The\nqualification \u2018almost everywhere\u2019 is non-trivial and is\nthe source of a famous problem in the foundations of statistical\nmechanics, the so-called \u2018measure zero problem\u2019 (to which\nwe turn in Section 3). So it is worth unpacking carefully what this\ncondition involves. Not all sets have a finite size. In fact, there\nare sets of measure zero. This may sound abstract but is very natural.\nTake a ruler and measure the length of certain objects. You will find,\nfor instance, that your pencil is 17cm long\u2014in the language of\nmathematics this means that the one dimensional Lebegue measure of the\npencil is 17. Now measure a geometrical point and answer the question:\nhow long is the point? The answer is that such a point has no\nextension and so its length is zero. In mathematical parlance: a set\nconsisting of a geometrical point is a measure zero set. The same goes\nfor a set of two geometrical points: also two geometrical points\ntogether have no extension and hence have measure zero. Another\nexample is the following: you have device to measure the surface of\nobjects in a plane. You find out that an A4 sheet has a surface of\n623.7 square centimetres. Then you are asked what the surface of a\nline is. The answer is: zero. Lines don\u2019t have surfaces. So with\nrespect to the two dimensional Lebesgue measure lines are measure zero\nsets.\n\nIn the context of ergodic theory, \u2018almost everywhere\u2019\nmeans, by definition, \u2018everywhere in \\(X\\) except, perhaps, in a\nset of measure zero\u2019. That is, whenever a claim is qualified as\n\u2018almost everywhere\u2019 it means that it could be false for\nsome points in \\(X\\), but these taken together have measure zero. Now\nwe are in a position to explain what the phrase means in the\ndefinition of ergodicity. As we have seen above, the time average (but\nnot the space average!) depends on the initial condition. If we say\nthat \\(f^* = \\bar{f}\\) almost everywhere we mean that all those\ninitial conditions for which it turns out to be the case that \\(f^*\n\\ne \\bar{f}\\) taken together form a set of measure zero\u2014they are\nlike a line in the plane.\n\nArmed with this understanding of the definition of ergodicity, we can\nnow discuss some important properties of ergodic systems. Consider a\nsubset \\(A\\) of \\(X\\). For instance, thinking again about the example\nof the oscillating ball, take the left half of the phase space. Then\ndefine the so-called characteristic function of \\(A, f_A\\), as\nfollows: \\(f_A (x) = 1\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(A\\) and \\(f_A (x) = 0\\)\nfor all \\(x\\) not in \\(A\\). Plugging this function into the definition\nof ergodicity yields: \\(f^{*}_A = \\mu(A)\\). This means that the\nproportion of time that the system\u2019s state spends in set \\(A\\)\nis proportional to the measure of that set. To make this even more\nintuitive, assume that the measure is normalised: \\(\\mu(X) = 1\\) (this\nis a very common and unproblematic assumption). If we then choose\n\\(A\\) so that \\(\\mu(A) = 1\\) \u2044 2, then we know that the system\nspends half of the time in \\(A\\); if \\(\\mu(A) = 1\\) \u2044 4, it\nspends a quarter of the time in \\(A\\); etc. As we will see below, this\nproperty of ergodic systems plays a crucial role in certain approaches\nto statistical mechanics.\n\nSince we are free to choose \\(A\\) as we wish, we immediately get\nanother important result: a system can be ergodic only if its\ntrajectory may access all parts of \\(X\\) of positive measure, i.e., if\nthe trajectory passes arbitrarily close to any point in \\(X\\)\ninfinitely many times as time tends towards infinity. And this implies\nthat the phase space of ergodic systems is called metrically\nindecomposable (or also \u2018irreducible\u2019 or\n\u2018inseparable\u2019): every set invariant under \\(T\\) (i.e.,\nevery set that is mapped onto itself under \\(T)\\) has either measure 0\nor 1. As a consequence, \\(X\\) cannot be divided into two or more\nsubspaces (of non-zero measure) that are invariant under \\(T\\).\nConversely, a non-ergodic system is metrically decomposable. Hence,\nmetric indecomposability and ergodicity are equivalent. A metrically\ndecomposable system is schematically illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Reducible system: no point in\nregion \\(P\\) evolves into region \\(Q\\) and vice versa.\n\n\nFinally, we would like to state a theorem that will become important\nin Section 4. One can prove that a system is ergodic iff\n\n\\[\\tag{E}\n\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\mu(T_k B \\cap A) = \\mu(b)\\mu(A)\n\\]\n\n\nholds for all subsets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) of \\(X\\). Although this\ncondition does not have an immediate intuitive interpretation, we will\nsee below that it is crucial for the understanding of the kind of\nrandomness we find in ergodic systems.\n",
