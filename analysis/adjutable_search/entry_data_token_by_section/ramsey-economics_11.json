    "main_text": "The Ramsey Rule and Its Ramifications || The Transversality Condition\n4.3 The Transversality Condition\n\n\nThe linear technology (eq. 11a) and the iso-elastic\n\\(U\\)-function (eq. 11b) allowed us to recognise immediately\nthat if a consumption stream satisfying the Ramsey Rule is to be the\noptimum, both capital and consumption should grow at the same\nexponential rate, \\(m\\). Identifying a sufficient condition for\noptimality in more general models is a lot more difficult. What we need\nis a condition on the long-run features of a consumption stream\nsatisfying the Ramsey Rule that can ensure it is the optimum. von\nWeizsacker (1965) showed that the required condition relates to the\nlong-run behaviour of the social value of capital associated with that\nconsumption stream. We now formalize the condition.\n\n\nLet \\(U\\) be the unit of account. Consider a consumption stream\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\). It follows that \\(U_{C(t)}\\) is the social worth of a\nmarginal unit of consumption. Write \\(P(t)\\) for \\(U_{C(t)}. P(t)\\)\nis called the (spot) accounting price of consumption. Because\n\\(e^{-\\delta t}P(t)\\) is the discounted value of \\(P(t)\\), it is\ncalled the present-value accounting price of consumption. If\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) satisfies the Ramsey Rule in Mark III,\n\\(e^{-\\delta t}P(t)\\) is also the present-value accounting price of a\nunit of capital stock.  von Weizsacker (1965) showed that a sufficient\ncondition for the optimality of \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) is \\(e^{-\\delta\nt}P(t)K(t) \\rightarrow A\\) as t \\(\\rightarrow \\infty\\), where \\(A\\) is\na (finite) non-negative number. In words, a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) to be the optimum is (i) that it satisfies\nthe Ramsey Rule, and (ii) that the present-value of the\neconomy\u2019s stock of capital is finite. Condition (ii), which is\nwidely known as the \u201ctransversality condition,\u201d eliminates\nthose feasible consumption streams that satisfy the Ramsey Rule but\nalong which there is excessive saving. A simple calculation confirms\nthat in Example 2 the transversality condition is satisfied if the\nsaving rate is \\(s^*\\) (eq. 18).\n",
