For example, it is often suggested that\nit could not possibly be rational to accept a contradiction.\n\nIt is a matter of ongoing debate what the conditions are under which\nit is rational to accept something. Nevertheless, it is commonly\nagreed that, as Hume put it, the wise person \u201cproportions his\nbeliefs to the evidence\u201d (1955, p. 118). If this is right, then\nif a sufficient case can be made out for a contradiction, it will be\nrational to believe it. And sometimes this does seem possible. We have\nseen that a seemingly compelling argument can be made in favour of the\ntruth of the strengthened Liar sentence, \u2018This sentence is not\ntrue\u2019. Whether or not one takes the argument in question to be\ncompletely persuasive, it suggests that there is nothing in principle\nimpossible about the existence of good arguments for true\ncontradictions. Of course, if there were conclusive evidence for the\nLNC, then no case for a contradiction could be strong enough. But\nconclusive evidence for any philosophical position is difficult to\nachieve.\n\nA more persuasive worry about dialetheism, relating to rationality, is\nthe claim that if a person could legitimately accept a contradiction,\nthen no one could be forced, rationally, to abandon any view\nheld. For if a person accepts \\(A\\) then, when an argument for \\(\\neg\nA\\) is put up, they could simply accept both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\).\n\nA dialetheist can reply that, again, not all contradictions are equal.\nEach sentence, including each contradiction, is evaluated on its\nmerits. While a case can be made for the claim that the Liar sentence\nis both true and false, but this in no way shows that a case can also\nbe made for Brisbane being and not being in Australia. (Of course, if\none subscribes to the claim that entailment is explosive, a case for\none contradiction is a case for all; but if entailment is\nparaconsistent, this argument is of no use.) \n\nAs orthodox philosophy of science indicates, there are, in fact, many\ndifferent considerations that speak for or against the rational\nacceptability of a theory or a view. Among the epistemic virtues of a\ntheory are: its adequacy to the data; its simplicity, cleanness and\nelegance; its unity and freedom from ad hoc hypotheses; its\nexplanatory and predictive power; etc. Not only do these (and other)\ncriteria come in degrees, but they may also be orthogonal to each\nother. In the end, the rational evaluation of a view must balance it\nagainst all criteria of this kind (of which, consistency is, arguably,\none), each, on its own, being defeasible. \n\nDialetheism asks us to consider the possibility that a theory lacking\nthe virtue of consistency may still overcomes its rivals in all or\nmost of the other respects. According to dialetheists, this is\nactually the case with the dialetheic account of the semantics of\nordinary language, whose advantages with respect to consistent\naccounts have already been shortly suggested above. And conversely, of\ncourse, an inconsistent theory may well be trumped by a consistent\ntheory, all things considered. So it may be rational to reject an\ninconsistent position, even if it is logically possible that it is\ntrue. Rationality considerations are dealt with at length in Priest\n2006. \n",
