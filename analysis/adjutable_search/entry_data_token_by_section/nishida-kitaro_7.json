    "main_text": "Theory of the Historical World || Enactive Intuition\n4.1 Enactive Intuition\n\n\nIn attempting to explain the formation and working of the historical\nworld, Nishida coined the term \u201caction-oriented intuition\u201d or \u201cenactive intuition\u201d\n(k\u014di-teki chokkan). His texts suggest a\nreciprocity between action and intuition, so that we could also speak\nof \u201cintuition-oriented action\u201d or simply of\n\u201caction-intuition.\u201d  Here again Nishida sought to discover the topos\nor common space that underlies a distinction, this time between\nintuition or seeing as a more or less passive reception of the world\nand its objects, and action as the human-engendered production of the\nworld. Hence, this is another case of his \u201cself-identity of contradictories.\u201d The common space is the enactive or performative\nintuition exemplified by artistic creation.\n\n\nFor example, we might ordinarily conceive of the\nartist as a pre-given entity who views, is inspired by, and utilizes\npre-given things in the world around her as she then goes about making\nher work. The production of the work would then be a causative process\ncontributing in turn to the production of the historical world. We\nmight also understand the work as an objectification of the artist, an\nexpression of her inner spirit that externalizes and actualizes\nit. Nishida envisioned an alternative, however.\n\n\nFor Nishida, the artist takes in or intuits\nthe world and transforms or enacts it, both of which are but two\nmoments in a single unfolding\u2014not only of the world but of the\nartist as well.  Both artist and work are formed mutually and are\nreflected in one another. Whereas this mutual formation can be described\nin terms of a causative process taking time, with the person first\nintuiting or internalizing and then acting or externalizing, Nishida\ndescribed it in terms of the place or topos wherein intuiting entails\nacting and acting entails intuiting, and wherein the difference between\ninternal and external collapses. Granted, the work can take on a life\nof its own as an object of appreciation or criticism, but it always\ncarries its reference to the artist, as the identity of the artist\nlikewise cannot be separated from her work.\n\n\nArtistic creation is only\none example of such poiesis, as Nishida called\nit. Scientific experimentation also provides an example of enactive intuition insofar as experiments require the performance of a body acting and understanding through instruments (NKZ VIII, 326).  Enactive or performative intuition is operative in praxis or political-social action as well, insofar as it\ngrasps the world as including the self. Nishida emphasized that\nenactive intuition is a bodily achievement, the performance of an\nembodied individual who in turn is formed by the world; again, both\nbody and world must be conceived as historical.  While\nenactive intuition pertains to the dialectical way the\nindividual historical body forms and is formed by the world, the way\nthe world forms, once again, is described by the phrase \u201cfrom the created to\nthe creating.\u201d\n",
