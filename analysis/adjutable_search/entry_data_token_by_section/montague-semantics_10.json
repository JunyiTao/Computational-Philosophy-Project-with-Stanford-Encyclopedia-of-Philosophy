    "main_text": "Philosophical Aspects || Ontology\n3.5 Ontology\n\nMontague\u2019s semantic analyses were given in terms of a\ntype-logical hierarchy whose basic ingredients were truth values,\npossible individuals, and possible worlds. While the exact nature of\nindividuals and worlds depends on the (arbitrary) choice of a\nparticular model (or \u2018Fregean interpretation\u2019), the truth\nvalues 1 (true) and 0 (false) transcend the class of all models, thus\nemphasizing their status as logical objects. A lot of work in current\nlinguistic semantics still applies Montague\u2019s type-logical\nhierarchy, which is however often enriched by events (or,\nmore generally: eventualities) that serve as the referents of\nverbs and verb phrases (Bach 1986a; Parsons 1990).\n\nIn early work on intensional analysis (Carnap 1947, Kaplan 1964),\npossible worlds had been identified with models of a suitable\nextensional language. For reasons indicated in section 3.1, Montague\n(1969, 164) broke with this tradition, appealing to Kripke\u2019s\naccount of modality based on possible worlds as unstructured basic\nobjects. In his essay \u2018On the nature of certain philosophical\nentities\u2019 (Montague 1969), he argued that this seemingly minor\ntechnical innovation opens a new perspective in philosophical\nanalysis, by reducing certain \u2018dubious\u2019 entities to\npredicate intensions or properties \u2013 functions mapping\npossible worlds to sets of objects. The idea was that, once the\nconceptual and techical problems of the semantics of intensional\nlanguages had been overcome, they may replace extensional predicate\nlogic as a basis of philosophical argument:\n\nPhilosophy is always capable of enlarging itself; that is, by\nmetamathematical or model-theoretic means \u2013 means available\nwithin set theory \u2013 one can \u201cjustify\u201d a language or\ntheory that transcends set theory, and then proceed to transact a new\nbranch of philosophy within the new language. It is now time to take\nsuch a step and to lay the foundations of intensional languages.\n(Montague 1969,165f.)\n\n\nMontague illustrated his claim by detailed analyses of (talk about)\npains, tasks, obligations, and events in terms of second-order\nintensional logic, which contained the core elements of his (slightly)\nlater compositional interpretation of English.\n\nAlthough it has since become common in linguistic semantics to analyse\ncontent in terms of possible worlds, they are not always taken to be\ntotally devoid of structure. As a case in point, Kratzer (2002) has\nargued that the verb know relates subjects to facts and thus\nits interpretation requires appeal to the mereology of worlds: facts\nare concrete parts worlds. Moreover, as in Kripke\u2019s original\napproach, semantic theory frequently imposes some external structure\non logical space. Thus, accessibility relations and distance measures\nbetween worlds are invoked to account for, respectively, propositional\nattitudes (along the lines of Hinitkka 1969) and counterfactual\nconditionals (following Lewis 1973). In a similar vein, the universe\nof individuals (or \u2018entities\u2019, in Montague\u2019s\nparlance) nowadays gives way to a richer domain of structured objects,\nincluding substances and their parts, which may serve as extensions of\nmass nouns such as water (Pelletier & Schubert 2003), as\nwell as groups and their members, which are denoted by plural noun\nphrases (Link 1983). Also when properties (loving John) are\nconsidered as entities for which predicates may hold (Mary likes\nloving John), additional structure is needed: property theory\ngives the tools to incorporate them (Turner 1983).\n\nOccasional doubts have been raised as to the adequacy of\nMontague\u2019s higher-order intensional logic as a tool for the\nsemantic interpretation of natural language:\n\nIt seems to me that this is the strategy employed by Montague\nGrammarians, who are in fact strongly committed to compositionality.\n[\u2026]. There is a price to be paid however. The higher order\nentities evoked in this \u201ctype theoretical ascent\u201d are much\nless realistic philosophically and psycholinguistically than our\noriginal individuals. Hence the ascent is bound to detract from the\npsycholinguistic and methodological realism of one\u2019s theory.\n(Hintikka 1983, 20)\n\n\nThis objection does not appreciate the role played by higher-order\nabstraction in compositional semantics, which is not to form sentences\nabout higher-order functions. Rather, \\(\\lambda\\)-abstraction is used\nas a heuristic tool to describe compositional contributions of\nexpressions to larger syntactic environments (cf. Zimmermann 2021,\nsec. 2.1). Thus, e.g., the extension of a determiner is defined as its\ncontribution to the truth value of a sentence in which it occurs (in\nsubject position), which can be described in terms of the extensions\nof the nouns and verb phrases it combines with \u2013 and these\nextensions are themselves sets (by a similar reasoning). The abstract\nhigher-order objects are thus merely convenient ways of describing the\nkinematics of compositionality and do not serve as the objects that\nthe sentences of the language so described are about, or that its\nterms refer to. As a case in point, it can be shown that even though\nthe (indirect) interpretation of the English fragment of Montague 1973\nmakes use of \\(\\lambda\\)-abstraction over second-order variables, its\nexpressive power is much weaker than higher-order type logic and does\nnot even have the resources to formulate certain meaning postulates to\nwhich its lexical items abide (Zimmermann 1983). In fact,\nHintikka\u2019s alternative (game-theoretical) semantics fares no\nbetter once it is formulated in a compositional way (see Hodges 1997\nor Caicedo et al. 2009).\n",
