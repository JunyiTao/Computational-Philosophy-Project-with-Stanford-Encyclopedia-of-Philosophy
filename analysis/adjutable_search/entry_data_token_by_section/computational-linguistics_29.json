For example, text corpora or\nnewswire might be mined for information about companies, by keying in\non known company names and terms such as \u201cCorp.\u201d, \n\u201c.com\u201d, \u201cheadquartered at\u201d, and \u201cannual\nrevenue of\u201d, as well as parts of speech and dependency\nrelations, and matching regular-expression patterns against local text\nsegments containing key phrases or positioned close to them. As\nanother example, summarization of earthquake reports might extract\nexpected information such as the epicenter of the quake, its magnitude\non the Richter scale, the time and duration of the event, affected\npopulation centers, extent of death tolls, injuries, and property\ndamage, consequences such as fires and tsunamis, etc. Extraction\npatterns can usually be thought of as targeting particular attributes\nin predetermined attribute-value frames (e.g., a frame for company\ninformation or a frame for facts about an earthquake), and the\nfilled-in frames may themselves be regarded as summaries, or may be\nused to generate natural-language summaries. Early systems of this\ntype were FRUMP (DeJong 1982) and JASPER (Andersen et al. 1992). Among\nthe hundreds of more modern extraction systems, a particularly\nsuccessful one in competitions has been SRI's\n\u201cFastus\u201d (Hobbs et al. 1997).\nNote that whether a pattern-based system is viewed as a knowledge\nextraction system or summarization system depends on the text it is\napplied to. If all the information of interest is bundled together in a\nsingle, extended text segment (as in the case of earthquake reports),\nthen the knowledge extracted can be viewed as a summary of the segment.\nIf instead the information is selectively extracted from miscellaneous\nsentences scattered through large text collections, with most of the\nmaterial being ignored as irrelevant to the purposes of extraction,\nthen we would view the activity of the system as information extraction\nrather than summarization.\nWhen a document to be summarized cannot be assumed to fall into\nsome predictable category, with the content structured and expressed\nin a stereotyped way, summarization is usually performed by selecting\nand combining \u201ccentral sentences\u201d from the document. A\nsentence is central to the extent that many other sentences in the\ndocument are similar to it, in terms of shared word content or some\nmore sophisticated similarity measure such as one based on the tf-idf\nmetric for terms, or a cosine metric in a dimensionality-reduced\nvector space (thus it is as if we were treating individual sentences\nas documents, and finding a few sentences whose\n\u201crelevance\u201d to the remaining sentences is\nmaximal). However, simply returning a sequence of central sentences\nwill not in general yield an adequate summary. For example, such\nsentences may contain unresolved pronouns or other referring\nexpressions, whose referents may need to be sought in non-central\nsentences. Also, central \u201csentences\u201d may actually be\nclauses embedded in lengthier sentences that contain unimportant\nsupplementary information. Heuristic techniques need to be applied to\nidentify and excise the extra material, and extracted clauses need to\nbe fluently and coherently combined. In other cases, complex\ndescriptions should be more simply and abstractly paraphrased. For\nexample, an appropriate condensation of a sentence such as \u201cThe\ntornado carried off the roof of a local farmhouse, and reduced its\nwalls and contents to rubble\u201d might be \u201cThe tornado\ndestroyed a local farmhouse.\u201d But while some of these issues are\npartially addressed in current systems, human-like summarization will\nrequire much deeper understanding than is currently\nattainable. Another difficulty in this area (even more so than in\nmachine translation) is the evaluation of summaries. Even human\njudgments differ greatly, depending, for instance, on the sensitivity\nof the evaluator to grammatical flaws, versus inadequacies in\ncontent.\n",
