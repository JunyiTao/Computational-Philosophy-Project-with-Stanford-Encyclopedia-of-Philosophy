Yet in the short period from 1809 to 1810 he was able to\ninstitute a radical reform of the entire Prussian educational system\nfrom elementary and secondary school to the University which was based\non the principle of free and universal education. His idea of\ncombining both teaching and research in one institution that guided\nhim in establishing the University of Berlin in 1810 (today\u2019s Humboldt\nUniversity) and the structures he created for this institution would\nbecome the model not only throughout Germany but also for the modern\nuniversity in most Western countries. Predictably, Humboldt soon ran\ninto difficulties with the established landed aristocracy in Prussia\nwhen he insisted that the University be endowed with landed property\nin order to insure its independence from the state and the changing\nwinds of politics. After quarreling with his superiors he was asked to\nresign his post and in 1810 was sent to Vienna as ambassador where,\nhowever, he soon became instrumental in convincing Austria to join the\nGrand Coalition of the European powers against Napoleon. But during\nthe initial diplomatic lull in Vienna he still found time for his\nlinguistic studies. His recently discovered Viennese note books\ncontain sketches of grammars for several South and Central American\nlanguages written in French that were intended to become part of his\nbrother\u2019s American Travel account. In 1811 he produced his first\nextensive philosophical and methodological statement, the Essai\nsur les langues du Nouveau Continent (Essay on the languages\nof the New Continent) that was to introduce his study of the\nIndian grammars of the Americas (GS Vol 3: 300\u2013341).\n\nDuring the negotiations for the first and second Paris peace treaty\nand subsequently at the Congress of Vienna he was successful in\ndefending Jewish rights but failed in his attempt to secure a liberal\nconstitution for the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund) to be based\non a statute of fundamental principles (Grundgesetz) that would have\nguaranteed the rights of all citizen. After representing Prussia at\nthe newly constituted Bundestag in Frankfurt on Main for a\nshort time, he was appointed Prussian ambassador to the Saint James\nCourt in London where, besides studying Sanskrit at the British Museum\nLibrary in his spare time, he was able, with the help of the Banking\nHouse of Rothschild, to organize a financial aid program for the\nreconstruction of the war-ravished Prussian economy. He returned to\nBerlin to the ministry of the Interior to head a committee to draft a\nnew Prussian constitution in 1819. But his carefully designed\ncomprehensive plan for introducing a liberal constitution (GS Vol 2:\n389\u2013455) that would have transformed Prussia into a genuine\nconstitutional monarchy did not have a chance to be adopted. When\nHumboldt strongly resisted the repressive measures taken by the royal\ngovernment in the wake of the Karlsbad decrees and in the ensuing\nassault on civil liberties, King Friedrich Wilhelm III on New Years\nEve of 1819 summarily dismissed him from all his duties. His dismissal\nmarked not only the end of his political career but the de\nfacto elimination in Prussia of the chances for the development\nof a true civil society, the creation of democratic institutions and\nthus for the middle classes to participate actively in the political\nlife of the country. Aside from a prolonged visit to Paris and London\nin 1828, Humboldt spent the rest of his life at the family estate in\nTegel which he had renowned architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel remodel\nin classicist style. There he concentrated his energy on his scholarly\nand linguistic work.\n",
