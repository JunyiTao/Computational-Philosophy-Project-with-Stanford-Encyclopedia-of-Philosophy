    "main_text": "\n\nLocke\u2019s greatest philosophical work, An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, is generally seen as a defining work of\nseventeenth-century empiricist epistemology and metaphysics. The moral\nphilosophy developed in this work is rarely taken up for critical\nanalysis, considered by many scholars of Locke\u2019s thought to be too\nobscure and confusing to be taken too seriously. The view is not only\nseen by many commentators as incomplete, but it carries a degree of\nrationalism that cannot be made consistent with our picture of Locke\nas the arch-empiricist of his period. While it is true that Locke\u2019s\ndiscussion of morality in the Essay is not as well-developed as\nmany of his other views, there is reason to think that morality was\nthe driving concern of this great work. For Locke, morality is the one\narea apart from mathematics wherein human reasoning can attain a level\nof rational certitude. For Locke, human reason may be weak with\nregards to our understanding of the natural world and the workings of\nthe human mind, but it is exactly suited for the job of figuring out\nhuman moral duty. By looking at Locke\u2019s moral philosophy, as it is\ndeveloped in the Essay and some of his earlier writings, we\ngain a heightened appreciation for Locke\u2019s motivations in the\nEssay, as well as a more nuanced understanding of the degree of\nLocke\u2019s empiricism. Further than this, Locke\u2019s moral philosophy offers\nus an important exemplar of seventeenth-century natural law theory,\nprobably the predominant moral view of the period.\n",
