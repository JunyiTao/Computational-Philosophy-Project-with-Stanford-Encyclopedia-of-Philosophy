    "main_text": "\n\nAs the theory of the atom, quantum mechanics is perhaps the most\nsuccessful theory in the history of science. It enables physicists,\nchemists, and technicians to calculate and predict the outcome of a\nvast number of experiments and to create new and advanced technology\nbased on the insight into the behavior of atomic objects. But it is\nalso a theory that challenges our imagination. It seems to violate\nsome fundamental principles of classical physics, principles that\neventually have become a part of western common sense since the rise\nof the modern worldview in the Renaissance. The aim of any\nmetaphysical interpretation of quantum mechanics is to account for\nthese violations.\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation was the first general attempt to\nunderstand the world of atoms as this is represented by quantum\nmechanics. The founding father was mainly the Danish physicist Niels\nBohr, but also Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and other physicists made\nimportant contributions to the overall understanding of the atomic\nworld that is associated with the name of the capital of Denmark.\n\nIn fact Bohr and Heisenberg never totally agreed on how to understand\nthe mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, and neither of them\never used the term \u201cthe Copenhagen interpretation\u201d as a\njoint name for their ideas. In fact, Bohr once distanced himself from\nwhat he considered to be Heisenberg\u2019s more subjective\ninterpretation (APHK, p.51). The term is rather a label\nintroduced by people opposing Bohr\u2019s idea of complementarity, to\nidentify what they saw as the common features behind the\nBohr-Heisenberg interpretation as it emerged in the late 1920s. Today\nthe Copenhagen interpretation is mostly regarded as synonymous with\nindeterminism, Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle, Born\u2019s\nstatistical interpretation of the wave function, and Bohr\u2019s\ncomplementarity interpretation of certain atomic phenomena.\n",
