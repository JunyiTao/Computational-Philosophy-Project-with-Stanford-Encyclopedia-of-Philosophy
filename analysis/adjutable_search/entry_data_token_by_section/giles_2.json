    "main_text": "Metaphysics and Theory of Knowledge\n3. Metaphysics and Theory of Knowledge\n\n\nTraditionally, Giles was described as a \u201cfaithful\u201d\ndisciple of Aquinas\u2019. Nowadays such a judgment is not accepted\nby scholars. After Concetta Luna argued persuasively in favor of the\nauthenticity of the Reportatio, it became clear that Giles,\nalready in the first stages of his career, develops his positions\ntaking Aquinas\u2019 teaching as a starting point for his own\nreflection, but criticizes and corrects the doctrines of the Dominican\nmaster in many aspects. Luna could also establish that Giles reworked\nhis Lectura on the Sentences (handed down to us as a\nreportatio) into an ordinatio only for the first two\nbooks. However, while the first book was completed shortly after the\nLectura, that is, during the years 1271\u20131273, the\nsecond book had to wait for completion until 1309. Luna gathered\nimpressive evidence suggesting that the Ordinatio of the\nthird book that goes under the name of Giles is, in fact,\nspurious. Broadly speaking, Giles\u2019 \u201cphilosophical\nproject\u201d tends to discuss critically Aquinas\u2019 position in\norder to improve the solutions he offered, without, however, trying to\ndiscard them radically. Recently, Katherine K\u00f6nig-Pralong showed\nthat this is the case for the debate about the natural desire for\nknowledge: although defended in in the context of a discussion with\nHenry of Ghent, Giles\u2019 position does not coincide with that of\nAquinas. According to him, in fact, human beings possess a natural\ndesire for knowledge that is satisfied by a limited understanding of\nseparate substances (K\u00f6nig-Pralong 2014). The same holds true\nalso for one of the most famous topics of his discussion with Henry of\nGhent, the distinction between \u201cessence\u201d and\n\u201cexistence\u201d. In this case, Giles radicalizes\nAquinas\u2019 doctrine of the real distinction, asserting that\nexistence must be conceived as a \u201cres addita\u201d\n[thing added] to essence (Pickav\u00e9 2016). Although the final\nresult of his theory was considered closer to Avicenna\u2019s\nsolution than to that of Aquinas, Giles nevertheless develops it\nstarting from Aquinas\u2019 own position (Wippel 1981), as emerges\nalready from his Questions on the Metaphysics (Conti 2014).  The\nconnection of this issue with the discussion with Henry of Ghent about\nthe concept of \u201ccreation\u201d was investigated in depth by\nGiorgio Pini (1992), who could show how Giles, while defending Aquinas\nand thereby the possibility of using some Aristotelian principles in\nan orthodox account of creation, goes beyond the positions of the\nDominican master, e. g. asserting the identity of\n\u201cesse\u201d and \u201ccreatio\u201d(see\nalso Porro 2014, Cross 2016). Giles advocated the compatibility of\nAristotelian doctrine with Christian faith also in his commentary on\nthe short treatise De bona fortuna attributed to Aristotle,\nbut in reality consisting in a compilation of passages taken from the\nEthica eudemia and the Magna moralia. The\ninterpretation of the concept of \u201cbona fortuna\u201d in those\ntexts implied problemas connected with contingency, necessity and the\ninterplay between divine causality and natural events. As\nVal\u00e9rie Cordonnier (2104) showed, Giles\u2019 solution was\nattacked by Henry of Ghent as leading to necessitarism.\n\n\nAs to the debate about the unicity of substantial form, Giles\u2019\nposition evolves during time. If we leave aside the Errores\nphilosophorum, since the authenticity of this work has been\ncontested with serious arguments (Bruni 1935, Koch 1944, Donati 1990b,\nLuna 1990), we can notice that Giles changes his position from the\nContra gradus et pluralitatem formarum (between the end of\n1277 and the beginning of 1278), where he, against Henry of Ghent\ndenies plurality of forms for every compound (Wilson 2014), to later\nworks, where he takes a more cautious stance in particular concerning\nman. The principle of individuation is identified, as in Aquinas, with\n\u201cmateria signata quantitate\u201d, that is, matter designated\nby its dimensions.  According to Giles, who criticizes  also Richard of\nMediavilla on this point, matter is pure potentiality and therefore\ncannot be distinguished into different kinds. For this reason, he\ncannot accept Aquinas\u2019 doctrine that the incorruptibility of celestial\nbodies derives from the peculiar nature of their matter (Donati\n1986). In Giles\u2019 opinion celestial bodies are not incorruptible\nbecause their matter is different from the matter of sublunar bodies,\nbut rather because their quantitas materiae cannot change its\ndeterminate dimensions. This is but one application of Giles\u2019 famous\ndoctrine of \u201cindeterminate dimensions\u201d. Modifying\nAverroes\u2019 doctrine in this respect, Giles argues that a portion of\nmatter, in order to be able to receive a form, needs to possess\nalready a sort of quantity. Such quantity, however, should not be\nidentified with the determinate dimensions a body possesses, but is\nrather a quantitas which remains the same during processes\nsuch as rarefaction and condensation. Giles\u2019 notion of\nquantitas materiae, which is not only generically extension\nor three-dimensionality, but seems to represent an unchangeable given\n\u201camount\u201d of matter pertaining to a body, has been\nconsidered comparable, some differences notwithstanding, to the modern\nnotion of mass (Donati 1988, Donati-Trifogli 2016).\n\n\nAfter the condemnation of 1277, a significant change can be noticed in\nGiles\u2019 position also in his solution of the problem of the eternity of\nthe world. At the beginning of his career he admitted the theoretical\npossibility of the eternity of the world, although rejecting\nAristotle\u2019s arguments proving the actual eternity of the world. Later\nhe shifted to a more \u201c Augustinian\u201d stance, rejecting the\nhypothesis of a creation \u201cab aeterno\u201d and\nadmitting that it is possible to prove the temporality of creation,\nalthough he finds that no conclusive argument has been advanced so far\n(but see also Cross 2016). Giles was much more steadfast in his\nopposition to another major tenet of \u201cAverroistic\u201d\ndoctrine, that is the unicity of the possible intellect. He maintained\nthat the possibility of actual knowledge on the part of the individual\ndepends necessarily on the fact that each body is informed by its own\nintellective soul, which is its form. For the same reasons Giles also\nrejected the unicity of the agent intellect, a doctrine he attributed\nto Avicenna (Del Punta-Donati-Luna 1993, Conolly 2007).\n\nGiles\u2019 account of knowledge is indebted to Aquinas, but, again,\nreveals many original features. In the first place, he insists on a\nstrictly causal interpretation \u2014 be it direct or via a medium\n\u2014 of the cognitive process, both at the level of sensory and\nintellectual acts. Secondly, the Augustinian master doesn\u2019t conceive\nof the role of \u201cintelligible species\u201d or formales\nexpressiones as he often writes, as essential to the process of\ncognition in itself. As Giorgio Pini (2016) has shown, the\nintelligible species is necessary only when the object cannot be\npresent in the intellect directly. Admittedly, this direct presence is\npossible only in the beatific vision (after death) and most probably\nin the cognition angels have of themselves. For human knowledge in\nthis life, on the contrary, intelligible species fulfill a necessary\nfunction, as causal proxies, as Pini (2016) writes, mediating between\nthe object and the cognitive power. Difficulties for Giles\u2019 account\nemerge especially when it comes to defining the ontological status of\nthe species. The interpretation of cognition in terms of causation\nseems in fact to imply, according to Giles\u2019 own presuppositions, that\nthe species belongs to the same kind of the thing it represents. On\nthe other hand, the intelligible species is in the intellect, and this\npresence is explained in terms of inherence of an accident (the\nspecies) in a substance. Giles himself is aware of this difficulty,\nsince in one passage he claims that such species are in themselves\nneither substances nor accidents. They can, however, be\n\u201creduced\u201d to the kind to which the represented thing\nbelongs.  Pini (2016) is right in pointing out that Giles\u2019 answer seems\nto raise more problems than it can solve.\n",
