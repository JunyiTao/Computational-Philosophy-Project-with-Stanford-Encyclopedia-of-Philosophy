    "main_text": "Frege\u2019s Logic and Philosophy of Mathematics || Courses-of-Values, Extensions, and Proposed Mathematical Foundations\n2.4 Courses-of-Values, Extensions, and Proposed Mathematical Foundations\n2.4.1 Courses-of-Values and Extensions\n\n\nFrege\u2019s ontology consisted of two fundamentally different types of\nentities, namely, functions and objects (1891, 1892b, 1904). Functions\nare in some sense \u2018unsaturated\u2019; i.e., they are the kind of\nthing which take objects as arguments and map those arguments to a\nvalue. This distinguishes them from objects. As we\u2019ve seen, the domain\nof objects included two special objects, namely, the truth-values The\nTrue and The False.\n\n\nIn his work of 1893/1903, Frege attempted to expand the domain of\nobjects by systematically associating, with each function \\(f\\), an\nobject which he called the course-of-values of \\(f\\). The\ncourse-of-values of a function is a record of the value of the function\nfor each argument. The principle Frege used to systematize\ncourses-of-values is Basic Law V (1893/\u00a720;):\nThe course-of-values of the concept \\(f\\) is identical to\nthe course-of-values of the concept \\(g\\) if and only if \\(f\\) and\n\\(g\\) agree on the value of every argument (i.e., if and only if for\nevery object \\(x\\), \\(f(x) = g(x)\\)).\n\n\nFrege used the a Greek epsilon with a smooth breathing mark above it\nas part of the notation for signifying the course-of-values of\nthe function \\(f\\):\n\n\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\varepsilon}\\!\\!f(\\varepsilon)\\) \n\n\n\nwhere the first occurrence of the Greek \\(\\varepsilon\\) (with the\nsmooth breathing mark above it) is a \u2018variable-binding\noperator\u2019 which we might read as \u2018the course-of-values\nof\u2019. To avoid the appearance of variable clash, we may also use\na Greek \\(\\alpha\\) (also with a smooth breathing mark above) as a\nvariable-binding operator. Using this notation, Frege formally\nrepresented Basic Law V in his system as:\n\nBasic Law V  \n\\(\n\\stackrel{,}{\\varepsilon}\\!\\!f(\\varepsilon) =\n\\, \\stackrel{,}{\\alpha}\\!g(\\alpha) \\equiv \\forall x(f(x) = g(x))\n\\)\n\n\n\n(Actually, Frege used an identity sign instead of the biconditional\nas the main connective of this principle, for reasons described\nabove.)\n\n\nFrege called the course-of-values of a concept \\(F\\) its\nextension. The extension of a concept \\(F\\) records just\nthose objects which \\(F\\) maps to The True. Thus Basic Law V applies\nequally well to the extensions of concepts. Let\n\u2018\\(\\phi(x)\\)\u2019 be an open sentence of any complexity with\nthe free variable \\(x\\) (the variable \\(x\\) may have more than one\noccurrence in \\(\\phi(x)\\), but for simplicity, assume it has only one\noccurrence). Then Frege would use the expression:\n\n\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\varepsilon}\\!\\! \\phi (\\varepsilon)\\),\n\n\nwhere the second epsilon replaces \\(x\\) in \\(\\phi (x)\\), to denote the\nextension of the concept \\(\\phi\\).  Where \u2018\\(n\\)\u2019 is the\nname of an object, Frege could define \u2018object \\(n\\) is an\nelement of the extension of the concept \\(\\phi\\)\u2019 in the\nfollowing simple terms: \u2018the concept \\(\\phi\\) maps \\(n\\) to The\nTrue\u2019, i.e., \\(\\phi(n)\\). For example, the number \\(3\\) is an\nelement of the extension of the concept\nodd number greater than \\(2\\) if and only if this concept\nmaps \\(3\\) to The True.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Basic Law V implies a contradiction, and this was\npointed out to Frege by Bertrand Russell just as the second volume of\nthe Grundgesetze was going to press. Russell recognized that\nsome extensions are elements of themselves and some are not; the\nextension of the concept extension is an element of itself,\nsince that concept would map its own extension to The True. The\nextension of the concept spoon is not an element of itself,\nbecause that concept would map its own extension to The False (since\nextensions aren\u2019t spoons). But now what about the\nconcept extension which is not an element of itself?  Let\n\\(E\\) represent this concept and let \\(e\\) name the extension of\n\\(E\\). Is \\(e\\) an element of itself? Well, \\(e\\) is an element of\nitself if and only if \\(E\\) maps \\(e\\) to The True (by the definition\nof \u2018element of\u2019 given at the end of the previous\nparagraph, where \\(e\\) is the extension of the concept \\(E\\)). But\n\\(E\\) maps \\(e\\) to The True if and only if \\(e\\) is an extension\nwhich is not an element of itself, i.e., if and only if \\(e\\) is not\nan element of itself. We have thus reasoned that \\(e\\) is an element\nof itself if and only if it is not, showing the incoherency in\nFrege\u2019s conception of an extension.\n\n\nFurther discussion of this problem can be found in the entry on\n Russell\u2019s Paradox,\n and a more complete\nexplanation of how the paradox arises in Frege\u2019s system is presented in\nthe entry on\n Frege\u2019s theorem and foundations for arithmetic.\n2.4.2 Proposed Foundation for Mathematics\n\n\nBefore he became aware of Russell\u2019s paradox, Frege attempted to\nconstruct a logical foundation for mathematics. Using the logical\nsystem containing Basic Law V (1893/1903), he attempted to demonstrate\nthe truth of the philosophical thesis known as logicism, i.e.,\nthe idea not only that mathematical concepts can be defined in terms of\npurely logical concepts but also that mathematical principles can be\nderived from the laws of logic alone. But given that the crucial\ndefinitions of mathematical concepts were stated in terms of\nextensions, the inconsistency in Basic Law V undermined Frege\u2019s attempt\nto establish the thesis of logicism. Few philosophers today believe\nthat mathematics can be reduced to logic in the way Frege had in mind.\nMathematical theories such as set theory seem to require some\nnon-logical concepts (such as set membership) which cannot be defined\nin terms of logical concepts, at least when axiomatized by certain\npowerful non-logical axioms (such as the proper axioms of\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory). Despite the fact that a contradiction\ninvalidated a part of his system, the intricate theoretical web of\ndefinitions and proofs developed in the Grundgesetze\nnevertheless offered philosophical logicians an intriguing conceptual\nframework. The ideas of\n Bertrand Russell\n and\n Alfred North Whitehead\n in\n Principia Mathematica\n owe\na huge debt to the work found in Frege\u2019s Grundgesetze.\n\n\nDespite Frege\u2019s failure to provide a coherent systematization of the\nnotion of an extension, we shall make use of the notion in what follows\nto explain Frege\u2019s theory of numbers and analysis of number statements,\nwithout assuming Basic Law V. It suffices to use our\ninformal understanding of the notion, though extensions can be\nrehabilitated in various ways, either axiomatically as in modern set\ntheory or as in the various ways logicians have found to weaken\nFrege\u2019s system.
