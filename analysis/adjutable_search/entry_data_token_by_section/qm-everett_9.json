    "main_text": "Four Arguments for the Faithfulness of Pure Wave Mechanics || The surplus structure of pure wave mechanics is in principle detectable and hence isn\u2019t surplus structure at all\n5.3 The surplus structure of pure wave mechanics is in principle detectable and hence isn\u2019t surplus structure at all\n\nEverett insisted that alternative relative states, even relative\nstates of macroscopically distinct records, were always at least in\nprinciple detectable by means of something like the Wigner\u2019s\nFriend \\(A\\)-measurement discussed above. This was Everett\u2019s\npoint in insisting that \u201cdue to the ever present possibility of\nobtaining interference effects between the elements, all elements of a\nsuperposition must be regarded as simultaneously existing\u201d\n(1956, 150). So while extremely difficult to detect, alternative\nrelative records are all equally real since the linear dynamics\nrequires that it be always in principle possible to measure an\nobservable that would detect other branches. And since they are in\nprinciple detectable, they do not represent surplus structure.\n\nNote that this does not mean that only the branches in a single\nphysically preferred basis are real. It means that every branch in\nevery decomposition of a the state of a system is real in precisely\nthe same sense as its presence entails in principle observational\nconsequences. That Everett considered alternative branches of the\nuniversal wave function to be always in principle detectable\nrepresents a significant difference between his formulation of quantum\nmechanics and a many-worlds theory where worlds are supposed to be\ncausally isolated.\n",
