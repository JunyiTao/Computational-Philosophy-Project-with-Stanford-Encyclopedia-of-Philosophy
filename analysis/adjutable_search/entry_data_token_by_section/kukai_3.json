    "main_text": "Thought || Works\n3.1 Works\n\nOf K\u016bkai\u2019s so-called theoretical works, the philosophically\nmost significant are Benkenmitsu nikky\u014dron, Himitsu\nmandara j\u016bj\u016bshinron, Hiz\u014d h\u014dyaku,\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi, Sh\u014djijiss\u014dgi, and\nUnjigi. The former three provide comparative analyses\nexploring what distinguishes Shingon esoteric Buddhism from other\nforms of religious thought and practice, including the exoteric forms\nof Buddhism. The latter three are expositions of the Shingon worldview\nand its concepts, and are grouped together to comprise the so-called\nSanbu-sho (\u201cThree Writings\u201d). Benkenmitsu\nnikky\u014dron (2 vols.) written in 814/815 sets forth the\ndifferences between esoteric and exoteric Buddhism to emphasize the\nsuperiority of the former. Starting from this foundation (i.e. of the\ndistinction and superiority of the esoteric standpoint), K\u016bkai\ncomposed the Sanbu-sho, in rapid succession from around 821\nto 824. These \u201cThree Writings\u201d provide expositions of what\ncommentators have called the \u201cmetaphysics\u201d of Shingon,\ndealing in detail with the three so-called mysterious aspects of the\ncosmic truth (Dharma): its \u201cbody, speech, and mind.\u201d\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi explicates the concept of\nsokushinj\u014dbutsu or enlightenment in one\u2019s\nimmediate embodied existence. Sh\u014djijiss\u014dgi and\nUnjigi are unique works of a \u201cmetaphysical\nlinguistics.\u201d They examine the interrelationship (which is\nultimately non-dualistic) between the phenomenal world, its sounds (or\n\u201cvoices\u201d) as \u201csigns\u201d (or\n\u201cletters\u201d), and reality itself, the \u201cmeaning,\u201d\nthey convey. In doing so, those two works explicate the Shingon\nconcept of hosshin sepp\u014d, the Buddha\u2019s preaching\nof the Dharma via cosmic phenomena. In fact all three of\nthese \u201cThree Writings\u201d deal with the embodied realization\nof the Dharma. But they do this from the different angles of the\nmicrocosm of the human body and the macrocosm of the cosmic body.\nEmbodiment then plays an important role in K\u016bkai\u2019s\nBuddhism. As we shall see below, the embodiment of the Dharma as such\nalso involves the incorporation of the mantra and the mandala along\nwith other esoteric features. The work that represents the culmination\nof K\u016bkai\u2019s thought, completed at the age of 57 in 830, is\nhis J\u016bj\u016bshinron (10 vols.) along with its abridged\nversion, Hiz\u014d h\u014dyaku (3 vols.). These two works\nposition Shingon esotericism as the culmination of all Buddhist and\nreligious standpoints. They make the grand claim that Shingon provides\nthe most comprehensive view to truth, the Dharma. All other religious\nviews on the other hand are mere approximations of that truth in\nvarious degrees and from various perspectives. Each religious\nstandpoint then corresponds to a specific level of development of the\nhuman mind, which in ten states leads up to the enlightened mind. The\nfinal culminating stage of enlightenment then is what corresponds to\nShingon doctrine as the most comprehensive, and hence \u201cmost\ntrue.\u201d Nevertheless, the pre-Shingon and exoteric teachings each\nhave their rightful place within this scheme so that they are not\nutterly discounted. In addition to the above-mentioned six major\nworks, there is also K\u016bkai\u2019s first work \u2013 written\nprior to his trip to China \u2013, the Sang\u014dsh\u012bki.\nThis was his first look at Buddhism in comparison with Taoism and\nConfucianism. In the following however, I shall focus on\nK\u016bkai\u2019s thought in the six major works. These are his\nmature works, and also universally recognized as his most important\ntheoretical works.\n",
