    "main_text": "History of the Paradox\n2. History of the Paradox\n\nRussell appears to have discovered his paradox in the late spring of\n1901, while working on his Principles of Mathematics (1903).\nExactly when the discovery took place is not clear. Russell initially\nstates that he came across the paradox \u201cin June 1901\u201d\n(1944, 13). Later he reports that the discovery took place \u201cin\nthe spring of 1901\u201d (1959, 75). Still later he reports that he\ncame across the paradox, not in June, but in May of that year (1969,\n221). Cesare Burali-Forti, an assistant to Giuseppe Peano, had\ndiscovered a similar antinomy in 1897 when he noticed that since the\nset of ordinals is well-ordered, it too must have an ordinal. However,\nthis ordinal must be both an element of the set of all ordinals and\nyet greater than every such element. \n\nUnlike Burali-Forti\u2019s paradox, Russell\u2019s paradox does not\ninvolve either ordinals or cardinals, relying instead only on the\nprimitive notions of set and set inclusion. Zermelo noticed a similar\ncontradiction sometime between 1897 and 1902, possibly anticipating\nRussell by some years (Ebbinghaus and Peckhaus 2007, 43\u201348;\nTappenden 2013, 336), although Kanamori concludes that the discovery\ncould easily have been as late as 1902 (Kanamori 2009, 411). As Linsky\npoints out, Zermelo\u2019s argument, while similar to\nRussell\u2019s, is best understood as one of a cluster of arguments\nby Zermelo, Schr\u00f6der and Cantor that \u201cindeed\nanticipated\u201d the mathematical argument Russell developed but\nthat turned out to be different in small but significant ways from\nRussell\u2019s argument (Linsky 2013, 11). In any case, the arguments\nwere thought to be of minor importance until it was realized how\ndetrimental they were to Gottlob Frege\u2019s\n foundations for arithmetic.\n\nRussell wrote to Frege with news of his paradox on June 16, 1902. (For\nthe relevant correspondence, see Russell (1902) and Frege (1902) in\nvan Heijenoort (1967).) The paradox was of significance to\nFrege\u2019s logical work since, in effect, it showed that the axioms\nFrege was using to formalize his logic were inconsistent.\nSpecifically, Frege\u2019s Axiom V requires that an expression such\nas \\(\\phi(x)\\) be considered both a function of the argument \\(x\\) and\na function of the argument \\(\\phi\\). (More precisely, Frege\u2019s\nLaw states that the course-of-values of a concept \\(f\\) is identical\nto the course-of-values of a concept \\(g\\) if and only if \\(f\\) and\n\\(g\\) agree on the value of every argument, i.e., if and only if for\nevery object \\(x, f(x) = g(x)\\). See section 2.4.1 of the entry on\n Gottlob Frege\n in this encyclopedia for more discussion.) In effect, it was this\nambiguity that allowed Russell to construct \\(R\\) in such a way\nthat it could both be and not be a member of itself.\n\nRussell\u2019s letter arrived just as the second volume of\nFrege\u2019s  Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (The Basic\nLaws of Arithmetic, 1893, 1903) was in press. Immediately\nappreciating the difficulty the paradox posed, Frege added to the\nGrundgesetze a hastily composed appendix discussing\nRussell\u2019s discovery. In the appendix Frege observes that the\nconsequences of Russell\u2019s paradox are not immediately clear. For\nexample, \u201cIs it always permissible to speak of the extension of\na concept, of a class? And if not, how do we recognize the exceptional\ncases? Can we always infer from the extension of one concept\u2019s\ncoinciding with that of a second, that every object which falls under\nthe first concept also falls under the second? These are the\nquestions,\u201d Frege notes, \u201craised by Mr Russell\u2019s\ncommunication\u201d (1903, 127). Because of these worries, Frege\neventually felt forced to abandon many of his views about logic and\nmathematics. \n\nEven so, as Russell points out, Frege met the news of the paradox with\nremarkable fortitude:\n\nAs I think about acts of integrity and grace, I realise that there is\nnothing in my knowledge to compare with Frege\u2019s dedication to\ntruth. His entire life\u2019s work was on the verge of completion,\nmuch of his work had been ignored to the benefit of men infinitely\nless capable, his second volume was about to be published, and upon\nfinding that his fundamental assumption was in error, he responded\nwith intellectual pleasure clearly submerging any feelings of personal\ndisappointment. It was almost superhuman and a telling indication of\nthat of which men are capable if their dedication is to creative work\nand knowledge instead of cruder efforts to dominate and be known.\n(Quoted in van Heijenoort (1967), 127)\n\n\nOf course, Russell too was concerned about the consequences of the\ncontradiction. Upon learning that Frege agreed with him about the\nsignificance of the result, he immediately began writing an appendix\nfor his own soon-to-be-released Principles of Mathematics.\nEntitled \u201cAppendix B: The Doctrine of Types,\u201d the appendix\nrepresents Russell\u2019s first attempt at providing a principled\nmethod for avoiding what soon was to become known as\n\u201cRussell\u2019s paradox.\u201d\n",
