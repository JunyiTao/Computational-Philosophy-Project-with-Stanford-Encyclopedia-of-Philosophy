    "main_text": "Principles of Equality and Justice || Presumption of Equality\n2.4 Presumption of Equality\n\nMany conceptions of equality operate along procedural lines involving\na presumption of equality. More materially concrete, ethical\napproaches, as described in the next section below, are concerned with\ndistributive criteria \u2013 the presumption of equality, in\ncontrast, is a formal, procedural principle of construction located on\na higher formal and argumentative level. What is at stake here is the\nquestion of the principle with which a material conception of justice\nshould be constructed, particularly once the approaches described\nabove prove inadequate. The presumption of equality is a prima facie\nprinciple of equal distribution for all goods politically suited for\nthe process of public distribution. In the domain of political\njustice, all members of a given community, taken together as a\ncollective body, have to decide centrally on the fair distribution of\nsocial goods, as well as on the distribution\u2019s fair realization. Any\nclaim to a particular distribution, including any existing\ndistributive scheme, has to be impartially justified, i.e., no\nownership should be recognized without justification. Applied to this\npolitical domain, the presumption of equality requires that everyone\nshould get an equal share in the distribution unless certain types of\ndifferences are relevant and justify, through universally acceptable\nreasons, unequal shares. (With different terms and arguments, this\nprinciple is conceived as a presumption by Benn & Peters (1959,\n111) and by Bedau (1967, 19); as a relevant reasons approach by\nWilliams (1973); as a conception of symmetry by Tugendhat (1993, 374;\n1997, chap. 3); as default option by Hinsch (2002, chap. 5); for\ncriticism of the presumption of equality, cf. Westen (1990, chap.\n10).) This presumption results in a principle of prima facie equal\ndistribution for all distributable goods. A strict principle of equal\ndistribution is not required, but it is morally necessary to justify\nimpartially any unequal distribution. The burden of proof lies on the\nside of those who favor any form of unequal distribution. (For a\njustification of the presumption in favor of equality s. Gosepath\n2004, II.8.; Gosepath 2015.)\n\nThe presumption of equality provides an elegant procedure for\nconstructing a theory of distributive justice (Gosepath 2004). One has\nonly to analyze what can justify unequal treatment or unequal\ndistribution in different spheres. To put it briefly, the following\npostulates of equality are at present generally considered morally\nrequired.\n\nStrict equality is called for in the legal sphere of civil freedoms,\nsince \u2013 putting aside limitation on freedom as punishment\n\u2013 there is no justification for any exceptions. As follows from\nthe principle of formal equality, all citizens must have equal general\nrights and duties, which are grounded in general laws that apply to\nall. This is the postulate of legal equality. In addition, the\npostulate of equal freedom is equally valid: every person should have\nthe same freedom to structure his or her life, and this in the most\nfar-reaching manner possible in a peaceful and appropriate social\norder.\n\nIn the political sphere, the possibilities for political participation\nshould be equally distributed. All citizens have the same claim to\nparticipation in forming public opinion, and in the distribution,\ncontrol, and exercise of political power. This is the postulate\n\u2013 requiring equal opportunity \u2013 of equal political power\nsharing. To ensure equal opportunity, social institutions have to be\ndesigned in such a way that persons who are disadvantaged, e.g. have a\nstutter or a low income, have an equal chance to make their views\nknown and to participate fully in the democratic process.\n\nIn the social sphere, equally gifted and motivated citizens must have\napproximately the same chances to obtain offices and positions,\nindependent of their economic or social class and native endowments.\nThis is the postulate of fair equality of social opportunity. Any\nunequal outcome must nevertheless result from equality of opportunity,\ni.e., qualifications alone should be the determining factor, not\nsocial background or influences of milieu.\n\nThe equality required in the economic sphere is complex, taking\naccount of several positions that \u2013 each according to the\npresumption of equality \u2013 justify a turn away from equality. A\nsalient problem here is what constitutes justified exceptions to equal\ndistribution of goods, the main subfield in the debate over adequate\nconceptions of distributive equality and its currency. The following\nfactors are usually considered eligible for justified unequal\ntreatment: (a) need or differing natural disadvantages (e.g.\ndisabilities); (b) existing rights or claims (e.g. private property);\n(c) differences in the performance of special services (e.g. desert,\nefforts, or sacrifices); (d) efficiency; and (e) compensation for\ndirect and indirect or structural discrimination (e.g. affirmative\naction).\n\nThese factors play an essential, albeit varied, role in the following\nalternative egalitarian theories of distributive justice. These offer\ndifferent accounts of what should be equalized in the economic sphere.\nMost can be understood as applications of the presumption of equality\n(whether they explicitly acknowledge it or not); only a few (like\nstrict equality, libertarianism, and sufficiency) are alternatives to\nthe presumption.\n",
