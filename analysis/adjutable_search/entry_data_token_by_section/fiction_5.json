    "main_text": "The Nature of Fiction || Speech-Act Accounts\n1.5 Speech-Act Accounts\n\nFor many critics (e.g., Currie 1990: 36; Lamarque & Olsen 1994,\n48; Davies 2001: 264; Stock 2017) these are unwanted consequences for\nan account of fiction. Excitingly told histories are still histories\nand so should be classified as non-fiction; and the fact that cracks\nin a rock might prompt imaginings just shows that the rock could be\ntreated as a work of fiction, not that it could turn out\nto be a work of fiction. These critics worry that\nWalton\u2019s conception of fiction is far broader than the\ntraditional one (to mark this point, Friend 2008, 152, distinguishes\nwhat she calls \u201cwalt-fiction\u201d from fiction in the usual\nsense), and insist that it is the latter notion that needs analysis or\nexplication. In the case of this traditional notion, they think we\nshould let the author\u2019s intentions determine\nfictionality, just as Searle proposed, but, unlike Searle, they\npropose that this be done by focusing on how the author intends an\naudience to respond to a text rather than on the author\u2019s own\nattitude to the text. One influential proposal of this type, defended\nby Greg Currie in The Nature of Fiction (1990), holds that\nauthors engage in a special illocutionary act of fictive utterance,\nwhich Currie then proceeds to describe in terms of Gricean reflexive\nintentions (cf. Grice 1957). In a fictive utterance, the author\nproduces a text with fictive intent, in the sense that he \n\n\nintends that we make-believe the text (or rather its constituent\npropositions) and he intends to get us to do this by means of our\nrecognition of that very intention. (Currie 1990: 30) \n\n\nWe can then say that \n\n\na work is fiction iff (a) it is the product of a fictive intent and\n(b) if the work is true, then it is at most accidentally true. (1990:\n46) \n\n\nThe second clause is added because Currie thinks that truth alone does\nnot disqualify a text from being fiction; an author may write a story\nthat, quite by chance, ends up correctly describing actual events. But\nif it is no accident that the work is true\u2014if the work is\nsomehow the result of the represented facts being the way they are\n(for example, by the author recording these facts from memory, even\nrepressed memory)\u2014then the work is non-fiction rather than\nfiction (Currie 1990: 47).\n\n\nCurrie is aware that as it stands this account needs finessing, since\nmany fictional works have a basis in actual fact. But for the most\npart Currie has remained true to this fictive utterance account of\nfiction. Later work changes some of the scaffolding of the theory, but\nnot its essential structure. For example, Currie (1995a) introduces a\nbroader philosophical conception of\nimagination\u2014simulation\u2014that covers both mental imagery and\npropositional imagining; he further suggests that \u201creaders of\nfiction simulate the state of a hypothetical reader of fact\u201d\n(Currie 1997: 144), and in doing so may also simulate the mental\nstates of the characters with whom they (as simulators of the\nhypothetical reader of fact) are emotionally engaged. (Matravers 2014:\nch. 3 criticizes the view that such simulation is distinctive of\nfiction.) \n\n\nOther authors offer variations on Currie\u2019s fictive utterance\naccount. Lamarque and Olsen, for example, think that in the case of\nfiction an author presents sentences, aiming \n\n\nfor the audience to make-believe (imagine or pretend) that the\nstandard speech act commitments associated with the sentences are\noperative even while knowing they are not. (Lamarque & Olsen 1994:\n43) \n\n\nTo attend to the sentences in this way is to adopt the fictive\nstance towards them, and it is an author\u2019s invitation that\nreaders adopt the fictive stance that makes something a work of\nfiction rather than non-fiction. Readers who adopt the fictive stance\ntowards the sentences can infer neither that the author believes them\nnor that they are true.\n\nLamarque and Olsen thus retain Currie\u2019s view that there is a\nnegative association between awareness that certain sentences are true\nand their status as fiction. But as we already saw when discussing\nsemantic accounts of fictionality and, later, Searle\u2019s pretense\naccount, any such negative association highlights a further problem.\nSome works of fiction, perhaps most, make authorial pronouncements\nthat are taken by both author and readers to be true (historical\nnovels are an obvious example). Works of fiction often contain true\ndescriptions of their geographical, historical, political, and social\nsetting, while works that belong to particular genres require true\ndescriptions of this kind if they are to be successful instances of\nthe genres (consider the setting of historical fiction like\nVidal\u2019s Lincoln (1984) or social-political fiction like\nSinclair\u2019s The Jungle (1906), or the descriptions of\nthe practice of policing and forensic science in\nCornwell\u2019s Scarpetta series, for example; see also Gibson\n2007: ch. 5; Matravers 2014). So there are parts of many, if not most,\nworks of fiction that are non-accidentally true, and so the works\nshould not straightforwardly count as fiction according to the\ncriteria set out by Currie and by Lamarque and Olsen. \n\nThose in the fictive utterance tradition have responded to this\nproblem in different ways. One response is to invoke a further\ndistinction between the fictionality of statements contained in the\nwork and the fictionality of the work itself, taking the former as\nfundamental. Currie, for example, claims that his account is primarily\nan account of the fictionality of statements contained in a work, with\nthe fictionality of the work depending on the status of such\nstatements \u201cin some perhaps irremediably vague way\u201d\n(Currie 1990: 49). Most fictional works, Currie thinks, are \u201ca\npatchwork of fiction-making and assertion\u201d (1990: 48\u20139).\n(For criticisms of such a \u201cpatchwork\u201d theory of fiction,\nsee, for example Friend 2008, 2011; Stock 2011, 2017.)\n\nThe second kind of response to this issue is more holistic. David\nDavies, for example, thinks that the primary focus of the\nfiction/non-fiction divide should be on narratives rather than whole\nworks (works might contain a series of narratives). What makes a\nnarrative fictional or non-fictional are the author\u2019s purposes\nand the constraints she works under (Davies 2007). If, for example,\nshe feels herself bound by the \u201cfidelity constraint\u201d\n(roughly, that one should only mention events that one believes to\nhave occurred, in the order in which they occurred), she is writing\nnon-fiction, whereas if she is motivated by some more general purpose\nin story-telling such as the desire to entertain her audience she is\nwriting fiction. As a result, even a narrative that tracks actual\nevents can be fiction if the author\u2019s story-telling purposes\noverride the fidelity constraint (Davies 2007: 47). (For criticism of\nDavies\u2019s narrative view of fiction, see Friend 2008, Stock\n2017.)\n\nBy contrast, Kathleen Stock\u2019s account of fiction allows that\nfictions may include propositions that are put forward simply because\nthey are important truths, and so material that should be believed and\nnot just imagined (e.g., the comments on slavery and Christianity in\nBeecher Stowe\u2019s Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin (1851)). For\nStock, such beliefs are not outliers, for she thinks that even if a\nperson imagines something that she also believes, she will\n(be disposed to) conjoin this in thought with other propositions that\nshe does not believe (Stock 2011; 2017, 147). Stock then\ndefines a fiction as, roughly, as a collection of fictive utterances\nin Currie\u2019s sense that are subject to the condition that where\nthere is more than one fictive utterance present, the author must also\nintend the reader or hearer to imagine them conjunctively. A\nfictional work, she thinks, is different. It is something\nusually carefully constructed and usually either written down for\nposterity, or performed publicly. By contrast, a fiction may be\nuttered only once, in a brief conversation with a single interlocutor\n(Stock 2017: 169\u201374).\n\nThese accounts all take authorial intention to be essential to being a\nfiction. For Walton, by contrast, the emphasis on authorial intention\nmistakes what are at best consequences of the author\u2019s\nhaving constructed a fiction for an essential feature of fiction\n(Walton 1990: 87). He thinks that this is borne out by the fact that\n\n\n\n[o]ne may well read a story or contemplate a picture (which is a\nfiction) without wondering which fictional truths the author or artist\nmeant to generate. (1990: 88) \n\n\nAll this confirms, he thinks, that the basic concept of a fiction is\nbest thought of as attaching to objects whose function is to serve as\na prop of a certain sort in games of make-believe rather than to\nillocutionary actions (1990: 87). (For further discussion of\nWalton\u2019s arguments on this point, see Stock 2017: ch. 7.)\n",
