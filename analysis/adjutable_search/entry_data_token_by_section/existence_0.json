    "main_text": "Frege and Russell: Existence is not a Property of Individuals\n1. Frege and Russell: Existence is not a Property of Individuals\n\nThere are two sets of reasons for denying that existence is a property\nof individuals. The first is Hume and Kant\u2019s puzzlement over\nwhat existence would add to an object. What is the difference between\na red apple and a red existing apple? To be red (or even to be an\napple) it must already exist, as only existing things instantiate\nproperties. (This principle\u2014that existence is conceptually prior\nto predication\u2014is rejected by Meinongians.) Saying it is red and\nan apple and furthermore exists is to say one thing too many. The\nthought seems to be that instantiating any property whatsoever\npresupposes existence and so existence is not a further property over\nand above a thing\u2019s genuine properties. The thought is not\nmerely that everything that instantiates any property exists, as the\nsame is true of being self-identical, being either human or not\nhuman\u2014assuming the law of excluded middle\u2014and being such\nthat 2+2=4, all of which seem to be unproblematic properties of\nindividuals even if that status is denied of existence. Instead the\nthought is that instantiating any property whatsoever conceptually\npresupposes the existence of a subject in a way that makes it\nincoherent to then think of existence as a further property of that\nthing. The thing\u2019s existence is prior to any predication to it\nand so it is incoherent to think of existence as a property had by the\nthing. This thought is behind Aristotle\u2019s thesis that existence\nis not a further feature of a thing beyond its essence.\n\nThe second consideration favoring the thesis that existence is not a\nproperty of individuals concerns the puzzle of negative singular\nexistentials. Suppose that existence is a property of the designation\nof the subject term in a singular existential sentence. Then\n\u2018Ronald McDonald does not exist\u2019 predicates nonexistence\nof the designation of the subject term, in which case reality includes\nan entity\u2014the designation of the singular term and subject of\npredication\u2014that has the property of not existing. That, Russell\ncomplained, runs contrary to a robust sense of reality, according to\nwhich everything exists. (See [Russell 1905a].) So, we should reject the claim that existence\nis a property of the designation of subject terms in existential\nsentences.\n\nTo appreciate Russell\u2019s alternative account, consider first\ngeneral nonexistence claims. To say that foxes exist is to say that\nthere are some things that are foxes; that is, the property of being a\nfox is instantiated. This is reflected in the standard regimentation\nof the sentences \u2018Foxes exist\u2019 and \u2018There are\nfoxes\u2019 in first-order quantificational logic as\n\u2203xFx, where Fx is the translation for the\npredicate \u2018x is a fox\u2019. General kind terms do\nnot, then, designate individuals, which we then (redundantly) say\nexist when using the predicate \u2018exists\u2019 or (paradoxically)\nsay are not when using the predicate \u2018does not\nexist\u2019. Instead, kind terms designate properties and simple\nseeming subject-predicate sentences like \u2018Foxes are\ncarnivores\u2019 are claimed to possess a more complicated logical\nform, \u2200x(Fx\u2192 Cx),\nwhere Cx translates the predicate \u2018x is a\ncarnivore\u2019. (This ignores the difficult question whether\ngenerics are really quantifiers at all, made more troubling by the\nfact that some generics seem to admit of exceptions\u2014\u2018Birds\nfly\u2019 is true, even though penguins are birds and don\u2019t\nfly; \u2018Cats have four legs\u2019 is true, even though there is a\nthree-legged cat wandering the planet. See the\nentry generics.) Given this analysis,\ngeneral nonexistence claims are unproblematic. The sentence\n\u2018Dragons do not exist\u2019 says, on this analysis, that the\nproperty of being a dragon is not instantiated. Take the most\ninclusive class of what there is; nothing in that class has the\nproperty of being a dragon. That is what \u00ac\u2203xDx\nsays, letting Dx translate the predicate \u2018x is\na dragon\u2019. This is significant because it does not require\nidentifying some entity to then predicate of that thing the property\nof nonexistence.\n\nThe Frege-Russell view that existence is a second-order property is\nbased on the idea that seemingly singular existential and negative\nexistential sentence like \u2018Bill Gates exists\u2019 and\n\u2018Ronald McDonald does not exist\u2019 are, in their deeper\nlogical form, general existential and negative existential claims. Let\nus focus on Russell\u2019s version of the view.\n\nRussell claimed that ordinary proper names like \u2018Bill\nGates\u2019 are disguised definite descriptions, something like\n\u2018the richest man in the world\u2019. And definite descriptions,\ngiven Russell\u2019s view of definite descriptions, are not genuine\nreferring terms but are instead quantificational expressions. The\nsentence \u2018The richest man in the world lives in\nWashington\u2019 has, as its logical form, a quantificational\nstructure and not a subject-predicate structure, equivalent to\nsomething like the following: There is a unique richest person who\nlives in Washington. Individuals do not enter directly into the\nproposition expressed by the sentence and are not part of the\nsentence\u2019s truth conditions.\n\nThese features of Russell\u2019s account of definite descriptions are\nsignificant for the treatment of seemingly singular existential and\nnegative existentials as they remove the need for entities to serve as\nthe designation of the singular terms for the meaningfulness and truth\nof negative existentials. Seemingly singular existentials like\n\u2018Bill Gates exists\u2019 are assimilated to general\nexistentials like \u2018Foxes exist\u2019. Assuming the proper name\n\u2018Bill Gates\u2019 is analyzed as the definite description\n\u2018the richest person alive\u2019, the sentence \u2018Bill Gates\nexists\u2019 has a logical form that can be more accurately expressed\nas There is someone that is uniquely richer than anyone else\nalive. This is neither redundant nor uninformative, as we can\ngrasp in thought properties while coherently and rationally wondering\nwhether or not they are instantiated. Russell\u2019s account\nsimilarly dissolves the problems generated by seemingly singular\nnegative existentials like \u2018Ronald McDonald does not\nexist\u2019. The truth of this sentence does not require a\ndesignation for the term of which nonexistence is then predicated.\n\u2018Ronald McDonald\u2019 is short for a definite description,\nsay, \u2018the happy hamburger clown\u2019. The sentence\n\u2018Ronald McDonald does not exist\u2019 expresses a proposition\nof the form It is not the case that there is a unique happy\nhamburger clown. This proposition is true even if absolutely\neverything there is exists. The proposition concerns the property of\nbeing a happy hamburger clown and says of that property that it is not\nuniquely instantiated. As the property\u2014the true subject of\npredication\u2014exists, however, we are not forced to countenance\nthe reality of entities that do not exist in order to recognize this\nsentence as saying something true.\n\nRussell\u2019s strategy depends on two claims. The first is that the\nnegation in a negative existential takes wide scope, applying to the\nwhole sub-sentence and not just the predicate. So, \u2018Ronald\nMcDonald does not exist\u2019 does not involve ascribing the\npredicate \u2018is nonexistent\u2019 to the subject \u2018Ronald\nMcDonald\u2019. Instead, it is more faithfully represented as\n\u2018It is not the case that [Ronald McDonald exists]\u2019. The\nsecond is that \u2018Ronald McDonald\u2019 is not a genuine\nreferring expression and the predicate \u2018exists\u2019 really\nmeans something like is instantiated. Notice that the first\nin solitude is not sufficient to overcome the problems generated by\nseemingly true singular negative existentials. Even if the deep form of\n\u2018Ronald McDonald does not exist\u2019 is\u00a0 \u2018It is not\nthe case that [Ronald McDonald exists]\u2019, assuming that\n\u2018Ronald McDonald\u2019 is a genuine singular term, the problem\nremains of finding in reality some entity to serve as the designation\nof \u2018Ronald McDonald\u2019. That entity is then part of reality\nand so, assuming that Meinongianism is false, is existent. In that\ncase, the sub-proposition Ronald McDonald exists is true and\nso its negation false. The problem of true singular negative\nexistentials does not rest on the supposition that they involve\nascribing the property of nonexistence. So, it is the second of the\nabove claims that carries the weight of Russell\u2019s solution to\nthe problem of singular negative existentials.\n\nThe second component of the Russellian solution\u2014the claim that\nordinary proper names like \u2018Bill Gates\u2019 are disguised\ndefinite descriptions\u2014faces a number of objections. One is the\nsemantic argument. (See [Kripke 1972].) Suppose that the descriptive\nequivalent of the name \u2018Bill Gates\u2019 is \u2018the richest\nliving person in the world\u2019. An adequate semantic understanding\nof the sentence \u2018Bill Gates is richer than everyone else\nalive\u2019 would then be sufficient for recognition of its truth.\n(More precisely, the sentence, \u2018If anyone is richer than\neveryone else alive, then Bill Gates is richer than everyone else\nalive\u2019 has this feature.) But that seems implausible. Surely we\nmust collect empirical data to determine its truth. One who wonders\nwhether someone, say, Warren Buffett, is wealthier than Bill Gates\ndoes not display irrationality or semantic ignorance, comparable to\none who wonders whether a fortnight is longer than 14 nights.\n\nPerhaps these considerations should motivate the descriptivist to\nabandon \u201cgreat deeds\u201d descriptions in favor of\nmetalinguistic descriptions like \u2018the person named \u2018Bill\nGates\u2019\u2019 or causal descriptions like \u2018the person that\nstands at the origin of this chain of uses of the name \u2018Bill\nGates\u2019\u2019. (For discussion, see [Bach 1981, 2002], [Kroon\n1987], and [Lewis 1984].) It is plausible that semantic competence\nsuffices to know that the sentence \u2018Bill Gates is named\n\u2018Bill Gates\u2019\u2019 is true and, while perhaps importing\nextra-semantic facts about language use, it is plausible that any\nreflective speaker of English knows that any token of \u2018Bill\nGates is the person that stands at the origin of this chain of uses of\nthe name \u2018Bill Gates\u2019\u2019 is true. So these\ndescriptions seem to survive the semantic argument presented in the\nprevious paragraph. But they face another objection, also facing\nsimpler versions of descriptivism: Namely, the modal objection\n([Kripke 1972]). While it is absolutely impossible that Bill Gates is\nnot Bill Gates, it is, it seems, metaphysically possible that Bill\nGates is not the richest person alive, instead being a middle\nAmerican, and it seems metaphysically possible that he is not named\n\u2018Bill Gates\u2019 and does not stand at the causal origin of\nany particular chain of uses of the name \u2018Bill Gates\u2019,\nunless the chain is individuated in part in terms of the actual\nindividual that grounds it.  This suggests that ordinary proper names\nand their alleged descriptive equivalents considered above are not, in\nfact, semantically equivalent, as they embed differently under modals\nlike \u2018it is necessary that\u2019. [See the entry on\n names\n for further discussion of these problems.]\n\nIn response to the modal argument, the descriptivist might avail\nherself of individual essence descriptions like \u2018the person\nidentical to Bill Gates\u2019, \u2018the person that\nBill-Gatizes\u2019, or rigidifications of the above descriptions,\n\u2018the person actually named \u2018Bill Gates\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018the person that actually stands at the origin of this chain of\nuses of the name \u2018Bill Gates\u2019\u2019, all of which\ndesignate the same person in every possible world in which they\ndesignate anything. It is plausible that semantic competence suffices\nfor recognition of the truth of the sentence \u2018Bill Gates is the\nperson identical to Bill Gates\u2019 and that that sentence expresses\na necessary truth. So these versions of descriptivism seem to escape\nthe problems discussed in the previous paragraphs. The first two\ncandidates, however, do not hold much promise for solving the problem\nof apparently true singular negative existentials. We know what the\nproperty of being identical to Bill Gates is, but only because we know\nthe result of plugging up one of the relata in the two-place relation\nis identical to with the individual Bill Gates.\nInsofar as we think that reality does not include any entity identical\nto Ronald McDonald, however, we are then left to wonder what the\nproperty of being identical to Ronald McDonald is. Because the\ncontents of these properties are derivative from the individuals that\nserve as the referents of their names, they are poor candidate\ndescriptive equivalences for a robust version of descriptivism and\nunlikely to shed light on the truth of seemingly singular negative\nexistentials like \u2018Ronald McDonald does not exist\u2019.\nSimilar considerations apply to the predicating view.\u00a0\n\nThe last candidates, rigidified metalinguistic and causal\ndescriptions, are the most promising for a robust form of descriptivism. But some have claimed to discern\nimportant differences in the functioning of a name and its alleged\nsemantically equivalent rigidified description, of any flavor. First,\nsome have claimed that the name \u2018Bill Gates\u2019 designates\nBill Gates with respect to every possible world, including worlds at\nwhich Bill Gates does not exist; otherwise the sentence \u2018Bill\nGates does not exist\u2019 would not be true with respect to those\nworlds. But the rigidified description \u2018the person actually\nnamed \u2018Bill Gates\u2019\u2019, for example, does not designate\nanything with respect to such a world, as nothing in the domain of\nthat world satisfies the condition being named \u2018Bill\nGates\u2019 at the actual world. That is because it is only Bill\nGates that satisfies that condition and he is not a member of the\ndomain of the possible world in question. So, differences in how a\nname and a rigidified description embed under modal operators can\nstill be discerned. (See [Salmon 1981] for further discussion.) This\nobjection assumes that the domain of quantification varies from world\nto world and that individuals that serve as the designation of\nordinary names are genuine contingent existents, theses that can be denied.\nThe objection also assumes that the range of the description is the\ndomain of the world with respect to which the description is being\nevaluated, the actuality operator rigidifying only the condition of\nthe description, which may also be denied. The second objection to\nrigidified descriptivism concerns the differences some have claimed\nbetween how names and rigidified descriptions embed under\npropositional attitude verbs. Intuitively, Jones would have still\nbelieved that Bill Gates is wealthy even if things had been ever so\nslightly different than they actually are\u2014say, I bought a poppy\nbagel instead of a sesame bagel this morning. But if the content of\nJones\u2019s belief concerns the actual world, as rigidified\ndescriptivism dictates, then, to retain his actual belief in that\ncounterfactual situation, he would have to believe something about\nanother possible world\u2014the actual world. But it is implausible\nthat Jones would have a belief about another possible world. So, the\ncontent of Jones\u2019s belief does not concern the actual world and\nso one can believe what is expressed by \u2018Bill Gates is\nwealthy\u2019 without believing what is expressed by \u2018The\nperson that actually stands at the origin of this chain of uses of the\nname \u2018Bill Gates\u2019 is wealthy\u2019. (See [Soames\n1998].)\u00a0\n\nThis section examined the thesis that seemingly singular\nexistential and negative existential sentences are really general\nexistentials, which are then treated as ascribing the property of\nbeing instantiated or not instantiated to some property. The need to\ngrant being to entities that do not exist in order to account for the\ntruth of sentences like \u2018Ronald McDonald does not exist\u2019\nis then avoided, which is no small victory. The success of that\nproposal, however, was seen to rest on the claim that ordinary proper\nnames have descriptive equivalences, which many philosophers of\nlanguage reject. (For more on the question of whether or not\n\u2018exists\u2019 is a genuine first-order predicate in deep\nlogical form, see, in addition to the earlier references in this\nsection: [Crane 2012], [Dancy 1986], [Geach 1954.1986], [Haaparanta\n1986], [Hintikka 1984,1986], [Kneale 1936], [Mackie 1976], [McGinn\n2000], [Miller 1975,1986] [Moltmamnn 2013], [Moore 1936], [Owen 1965],\n[Pears 1967], [Quine 1948], [van Inwagen 2008], [Vilkko and Hintikka\n2006], [Wiggins 1995], [Williams 1981], and [Williams 1995].\n",
