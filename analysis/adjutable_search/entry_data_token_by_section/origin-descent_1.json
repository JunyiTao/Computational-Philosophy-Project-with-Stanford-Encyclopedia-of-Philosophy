    "main_text": "The Origins of Darwin\u2019s Theory || Darwin\u2019s Early Reflections\n1.2 Darwin\u2019s Early Reflections\n\nIn its historical origins, Darwin\u2019s theory was different in kind\nfrom its main predecessors in important ways (Ruse 2013b; see also the\nentry on \n evolutionary thought before Darwin).\n Viewed against a longer historical scenario,\nDarwin\u2019s theory does not deal with cosmology or the origins of\nthe world and life through naturalistic means, and therefore was more\nrestricted in its theoretical scope than its main predecessors\ninfluenced by the reflections of Buffon, Herder, and German\nNaturphilosophen. It also differed from the historical\ndevelopmentalism of his German contemporary, the paleontologist\nHeinrich G. Bronn (Gliboff 2008, 2007). This restriction also\ndistinguished Darwin\u2019s work more immediately from the grand\nevolutionary cosmology put forth anonymously in 1844 by the Scottish\npublisher Robert Chambers (1802\u201371) in his immensely popular\nVestiges of the Natural History of Creation, a work which in\nmany respects prepared Victorian society in England, and pre-Civil War\nAmerica for general evolutionary theories (Secord 2000; MacPherson\n2015). It also distinguished it from the theories of his contemporary\nHerbert Spencer (1820\u20131903) summarized below.\n\nDarwin\u2019s theory first took written form in reflections in a\nseries of notebooks begun during the latter part of the\nBeagle voyage and continued after the return of the\nBeagle in October of 1836. His reflections on the possibility\nof species change are first entered in March of 1837 (\u201cRed\nNotebook\u201d) and are developed in the other notebooks (B\u2013E)\nthrough July of 1839 (Darwin 1836\u20131844 [1987]; Hodge 2013a,\n2003). Beginning with the reflections of the third or \u201cD\u201d\nNotebook, composed between July and October of 1838, Darwin first\nworked out the rudiments of what was to become his theory of natural\nselection. In the parallel \u201cM\u201d and \u201cN\u201d\nNotebooks, dating between July of 1838 and July of 1839, and in a\nloose collection called \u201cOld and Useless Notes\u201d, dating\nfrom approximately 1838\u201340, he also developed many of his main\nideas on human evolution that would only be made public in the\nDescent of Man of 1871 (see below).\n To summarize a complex issue, these Notebook reflections show\nDarwin proceeding through a series of stages in which he first\nformulated a general theory of the transformation of species from\ncommon ancestry.  He then attempted to work out a causal theory of\nlife that would explain the tendency of life to complexify and\ndiversify (Hodge 2013a, 2003, 1985; Sloan 1986). This causal inquiry\ninto the underlying nature of life , and the explanation of\nlife\u2019s innate tendency to develop and complexify, was then\nreplaced by a shift in focus away from inner tendencies of life. It\nwas replaced by a concern with external forces controlling population,\nwhich was, following Thomas Malthus\u2019s (1766\u20131834), assumed\nto expand geometrically.  This shift allowed him to develop the\nimplications of population increase for the transformation of\nspecies.\n\nBy universalizing the Malthusian \u201cprinciple of\npopulation\u201d, Darwin introduced an \u201cinertial\u201d\nprinciple into his theory, although such language is never used in his\ntext. Newton\u2019s first law, for example, established his physical\nsystem upon the tendency of a body in motion to persist either at rest\nor in uniform motion in a straight line, requiring a causal\nexplanation for any deviations from this initial state. But Newton did\nnot seek a deeper metaphysical explanation for this tendency.\nSimilarly, the principle of population supplied Darwin with the\nassumption of an initial dynamic state of affairs that was not itself\nexplained within the theory\u2014there is no attempt to account\ncausally for this tendency of living beings universally to reproduce\ngeometrically. The principle of population might therefore be regarded\nas functioning axiomatically, defining a set of initial conditions\nfrom which any deviance from this ideal state demands explanation.\nThis theoretical shift enabled Darwin to bracket his earlier efforts\nto develop a causal theory of life, and focus instead on the means by\nwhich the dynamic force of population was controlled. This allowed him\nto emphasize how this control on population worked in company with the\nphenomenon of slight individual variation and changing conditions of\nlife to produce a gradual change of form and function. Darwin would\nlater claim that he was able empirically to support the claim that\nliving populations do tend to increase in this way, but he does not\noffer a causal theory of life to explain this tendency\n(Origin 1859: chp. 3, 63\u201368).\n",
