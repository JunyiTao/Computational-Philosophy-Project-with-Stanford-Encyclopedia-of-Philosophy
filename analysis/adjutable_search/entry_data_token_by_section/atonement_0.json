    "main_text": "The Concept of Atonement and Conceptual Connections || The Origin of the Word \u201cAtonement\u201d and its Uses\n1.1 The Origin of the Word \u201cAtonement\u201d and its Uses\n\nThe words \u201catone\u201d and \u201catonement\u201d are derived\nfrom the expressions \u201cmake at one\u201d, and \u201cat\nonement\u201d. Usage of the latter phrase can be traced to as early\nas the 1300s in the writings of John Wycliffe (Hayes 1998). The word\nthus carries at its heart the notion of putting parties at\none\u2014unifying, or reconciling. The Oxford English Dictionary\noffers several definitions of atonement:\n\n\u201cthe condition of being at one with others\u201d\n(def. 1),\n\u201cthe action of setting at one, or condition of being set at\none, after discord or strife\u201d (def. 2),\n\u201creconciliation or restoration of friendly relations between\nGod and sinners\u201d (def. 3), and\n\u201cpropitiation of an offended or injured person, by\nreparation of wrong or injury; amends, satisfaction, expiation\u201d\n(def. 4).\n\n\nThe word applies both to relationships between non-divine people, and\nto relationships between God and non-divine people. Both kinds of\nrelationships can be damaged and require atonement for repair.\n\nThe definition of atonement in terms of making amends clarifies both\nnotions through the vivid imagery of a torn garment. As a whole\ngarment might become torn and require mending to repair, so a whole\nrelationship might become ruptured and require amends to repair. When\na garment is mended, the torn parts are brought back together into a\nwhole. Likewise, when proper amends are offered, the parties of the\nrelationship are brought back together into a whole\u2014they are\nmade at one, or reconciled. Making amends is thus an act of\natonement\u2014something done with the aim of reconciling the\nestranged parties.\n\nThe image of the torn garment suggests another feature of atonement:\nit typically involves a community. Society is often metaphorically\ndescribed as a garment, e.g., \u201cthe fabric of society\u201d.\nWhen a garment is torn, some threads within the garment are broken,\nsome parts of the fabric are disconnected. But the entire garment is\nalso said to be torn. So atonement can be given not just to reconcile\ntwo individual parties, but to reconcile an individual or a collective\nwith a collective.\n\nAlthough the word derives from English in the 1300s, the concept it\ndenotes is plainly much older. Early Greek literature contains the\nconcept of an atoning sacrifice (Hengel 1986; Versnel 2005). The book\nof Leviticus in the Tanakh describes various sacrifices the Hebrew\npeople were to offer, some\u2014most notably the sacrifices on the\nDay of Atonement, or Yom Kippur\u2014in order to atone for sin\nagainst God (Hayes 1998; Klawans 2006; Milgrom 1991). Various passages\nin the New Testament describe Christ as atoning for human sin (e.g.,\nRomans 3:23\u201325; 1John\n 2:2).[1]\n These passages state the famous Christian doctrine of\natonement\u2014the doctrine that through some of his deeds, including\nespecially his crucifixion,\n\n\nJesus acts in such a way as to remove the rift or division between\nhumans and God that is due to human sin in order to achieve\nreconciliation between humans and God.
