    "main_text": "\n\nAuditory perception raises a variety of challenging philosophical\nquestions. What do we hear? What are the objects of auditory\nawareness? What is the content of audition? Is hearing spatial? How\ndoes audition differ from vision and other sense modalities? How does\nthe perception of sounds differ from that of colors and ordinary\nobjects? This entry presents the main debates in this developing area\nand discusses promising avenues for future inquiry. It discusses the\nmotivation for exploring non-visual modalities, how audition bears on\ntheorizing about perception, and questions concerning the objects,\ncontents, phenomenology, varieties, and bounds of auditory\nperception.\n",
