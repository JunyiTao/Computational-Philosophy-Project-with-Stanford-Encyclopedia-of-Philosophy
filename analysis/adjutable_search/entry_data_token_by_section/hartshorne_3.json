    "main_text": "Axiology\n4. Axiology\n\nHartshorne views the cosmos as a \u201cmetaphysical monarchy,\u201d\nwith God as the presiding, but not omnipotent, head, and he sees human\nsociety as a \u201cmetaphysical democracy,\u201d with each member as\nan equal. This makes him a liberal in politics if\n\u201cliberalism\u201d refers to the egalitarian belief that none of\nus is God. That is, due to the fact of pervasive pluralism of\ncomprehensive doctrines that citizens affirm, none of us should\npresume to act like the classical theistic God by unreasonably\nimposing our view of the world on others. Although Hartshorne and\nWhitehead are both political liberals, Hartshorne is, despite his view\nof panpsychist reality as thoroughly social, more of a libertarian\nliberal and Whitehead more of a redistributive liberal. In axiology as\nwell as in metaphysics/theodicy, freedom is crucial, on\nHartshorne\u2019s view.\n\nHartshorne\u2019s panpsychism (or psychicalism) entails the belief\nthat each active singular in nature, even those like electrons and\nplant cells that exhibit feeling if not\u00a0mentality, is nonetheless\na center of intrinsic, and not merely instrumental, value. As a\nresult, Hartshorne\u2019s metaphysics is meant to provide a basis for\nboth an aesthetic appreciation of the value in nature, as well as for\nan environmental ethics where intrinsic and instrumental values in\nnature are weighed. In fact, Hartshorne was one of the first\nphilosophers to write in detail on topics in environmental ethics.\n\nAs a published expert on bird song, Hartshorne is the first\nphilosopher since Aristotle to be an expert in both metaphysics and\nornithology. He writes specifically of the aesthetic categories\nrequired to explain why birds sing outside of mating season and when\nterritory is not threatened\u2014two occasions for bird song that are\ncrucial to the behaviorists\u2019 account. Birds like to\nsing, he concludes. His discovery of the \u201cmonotony threshold\u201d\nregarding bird song is still cited by ornithologists.\nHartshorne\u2019s ornithology thus serves to highlight the crucial\nrole that aesthetic categories play in Hartshorne\u2019s philosophy\n(from the ancient Greek word for feeling: aesthesis), from\nthe minuscule feelings of microscopic reality to divine feelings.\n\nHartshorne\u2019s criticism of anthropocentrism is due not only to\nhis concern for God, but also for beings-in-becoming who experience in\na less sophisticated way than humans. To say that all active singulars\nfeel\u2014leaving out of the picture abstractions like\n\u201ctwoness\u201d or insentient composites of active singulars\nthat do not themselves feel as wholes\u2014is not to say that they\nare self-conscious or that they think. As before, however,\nHartshorne\u2019s axiology is ultimately theocentric in\ncharacter.\n",
