    "main_text": "\n\nGroups often need to reach decisions and decisions can be complex,\ninvolving the assessment of several related issues. For example, in a\nuniversity a hiring committee typically decides on a candidate on the\nbasis of her teaching and research qualities. A city council\nconfronted with the decision of building a bridge, may ask its members\nto state whether they are favorable or not and, at the same time, to\nprovide reasons for their position (like economical and environmental\nimpacts, or expenditure considerations). Lastly, jurors are required\nto decide on the liability of a defendant by expressing their\njudgments on the conditions prescribed by the relevant code of law for\nthe case at hand. As pointed out by Kornhauser and Sager (1986)\nreferring to real jury trials, the aggregation of individual opinions\non logically interrelated propositions can lead to a paradoxical\nresult, the so-called doctrinal paradox. Inspired by the\ndoctrinal paradox in jurisprudence, the problem of judgment\naggregation attracted the interest of political scientists,\nphilosophers, logicians, economists and computer scientists. Links to\nsocial choice theory have shown that, similar to the problem of\npreference aggregation (Arrow 1951/1963; Sen 1970), a judgment\naggregation procedure that satisfies a number of desirable properties\ndoes not exist.\n\nThe question judgment aggregation addresses is how we can define\naggregation procedures that preserve individual rationality at the\ncollective level. From a philosophical point of view, such question\nconcerns the nature of group attitudes such as group beliefs (Roth\n2011). When the city council decides to build the bridge, the decision\nis taken on the basis of individual beliefs that, for example, the\nbridge will have a positive impact on the development of the economic\nactivities in the area and does not represent an environmental threat.\nThus, the formal approach to judgment aggregation can serve to cast\nlight on the dependence between individual and collective beliefs (if\nthere are any). The questions tackled by judgment aggregation are also\nrelevant for the testimony problem investigated in social epistemology\n(Goldman 1999, 2004, 2010). How shall the diverging opinions of\nexperts in a panel be combined and how should a rational agent respond\nto such disagreement?\n\nThe problem of combining potentially conflicting pieces of information\ndoes not arise only when a group of people needs to make a decision.\nArtificial intelligence also explores ways to aggregate conflicting\nsensors\u2019 information, experts\u2019 opinions or databases into\na consistent one (Bloch et al. 2001). The combination of information\ncoming from heterogeneous sensors improves the deficiencies of the\nindividual sensors increasing the performances of a system. Examples\nare sensors of gesture recognition, screen rotation, and accelerometer\nin smart phones. Distributed databases may need to be accessed and\nmanaged at the same time to share data, for example, a hospital may\nneed to access the data collected about patients by different units.\nInternet users can find ratings on products provided by people who\nhave purchased and assessed them on different online platforms. The\ntype of information to be combined can differ, and so its\nrepresentation can be numerical or symbolic: numbers, linguistic\nvalues, statistical probability distributions, binary preferences,\nutility functions etc. Yet all examples mentioned above deal with the\nproblem of merging items coming from heterogeneous sources and with\nthe issue of managing conflicts. At a purely formal level, belief\nmerging studies the fusion of independent and equally reliable sources\nof information expressed in propositional logic. As with judgment\naggregation, belief merging addresses the problem of fusing several\nindividual bases expressed in propositional logic into a consistent\none. Given the structural similarity of the problems investigated by\nthese two disciplines, exploring their connections can reveal how\nsimilar these formalisms really are. On a more practical level, the\napplication of operators defined in belief merging to judgment\naggregation problems lead to the definition of a wider class of\naggregation operators for judgment aggregation, the so-called\ndistance-based procedures.\n\nThe focus of this entry is to draw explicit connections between\njudgment aggregation and the belief merging literature. Judgment\naggregation will be briefly introduced in the next section. For a more\ncomprehensive introduction to judgment aggregation the reader is\nreferred to (Grossi and Pigozzi 2014; Endriss 2016).\n",
