    "main_text": "Autonomy in Social and Political Philosophy || Autonomy and the Foundations of Liberalism\n3.1 Autonomy and the Foundations of Liberalism\n\nThe conception of the autonomous person plays a variety of roles in\nvarious constructions of liberal political theory (for recent\ndiscussion, see, e.g., Coburn 2010, Christman 2015 and the essays in\nChristman and Anderson, eds. 2005). Principally, it serves as the\nmodel of the person whose perspective is used to formulate and justify\npolitical principles, as in social contract models of principles of\njustice (Rawls 1971). Also (and correspondingly) it serves as the\nmodel of the citizen whose basic interests are reflected in those\nprinciples, such as in the claim that basic liberties, opportunities,\nand other primary goods are fundamental to flourishing lives no matter\nwhat moral commitments, life plans, or other particulars of the person\nmight obtain (Kymlicka 1989, 10\u201319, Waldron 1993:\n 155\u20136).[4]\n Moreover, autonomy is ascribed to persons (or projected as an ideal)\nin order to delineate and critique oppressive social conditions,\nliberation from which is considered a fundamental goal of justice\n(whether or not those critiques are described as within the liberal\ntradition or as a specific alternative to it) (cf. Keornahan 1999,\nCornell 1998, Young 1990, Gould 1988; cf. also Hirschmann 2002,\n1\u201329).\n\nFor our purposes here, liberalism refers generally to that approach to\npolitical power and social justice that determines principles of right\n(justice) prior to, and largely independent of, determination of\nconceptions of the good (though see Liberalism; see also\nChristman 2017, ch. 4). This implies that the liberal conception of\njustice, and the legitimation of political power more generally, can\nbe specified and justified without crucial reference to controversial\nconceptions of value and moral principles (what Rawls calls\n\u201ccomprehensive moral conceptions\u201d (Rawls 1993,\n13\u201315). The fact of permanent pluralism of such moral\nconceptions is therefore central to\n liberalism.[5]\n\nOne manner in which debates concerning autonomy directly connect to\ncontroversies within and about liberalism concerns the role that state\nneutrality is to play in the justification and application of\nprinciples of justice. Neutrality is a controversial standard, of\ncourse, and the precise way in which liberal theory is committed to a\nrequirement of neutrality is complex and controversial (see Raz 1986,\n110\u201364, Waldron 1993, 143\u201367). The question to be asked\nhere is whether the conception of autonomy utilized in liberal\ntheories must itself attempt to be neutral concerning various\nconceptions of morality and value, or, alternatively, does the\nreliance on autonomy in the justification and specification of liberal\ntheories of justice render them non-neutral simply because of this\nreliance (no matter how \u201cneutral\u201d the conception of\nautonomy utilized turns out to be) (Christman 2015).\n\nLet us consider this first question and in so doing revisit the issue\nof whether the independence implicit in autonomy should best be\nconceived in a purely \u201cprocedural\u201d manner or more\nsubstantively. Recall that some theorists view autonomy as requiring\nminimal competence (or rationality) along with authenticity, where the\nlatter condition is fleshed out in terms of the capacity to\nreflectively accept motivational aspects of oneself. This view can be\ncalled \u201cproceduralist\u201d because it demands that the\nprocedure by which a person comes to identify a desire (or trait) as\nher own is what is crucial in the determination of its authenticity\nand hence autonomy. This conception of autonomy is adopted, according\nto its defenders, because doing so is the only way to ensure that\nautonomy is neutral toward all conceptions of value and the good that\nreasonable adults may come to internalize (Dworkin 1989, Freyenhage\n2017).\n\nCritics of this view have pointed to cases where it is imagined that\npersons adopt what we all would call oppressive and overly restrictive\nlife situations but in a way that meets the minimal conditions of\nautonomy on proceduralist accounts, so that on such accounts they\ncount as autonomous because of the self-governing processes by which\nthey entered such oppressive conditions. These critics argue that any\nconception of autonomy that ascribes that trait to such people is\nwrongly conceived (Benson 1987, MacKenzie & Stoljar 2001b and\n2017, Waller 1993, and Oshana 1998). On the basis of such a judgment,\nthey argue that normatively substantive conditions should be added to\nthe requirements of autonomy, conditions such as the ability to\nrecognize and follow certain moral or political norms (See Benson\n1987, Wolf 1980; for criticism, see Berofsky 1995, ch. 7). This\ncriticism suggests that considerations concerning the autonomous self\ncannot avoid questions of identity and hence whether the self of\nself-government can be understood independently of the (perhaps\nsocially defined) values in terms of which people conceive of\nthemselves; this is a subject to which we now turn. \n",
