    "main_text": "Suffering\n9. Suffering\n\nThe position outlined above depends heavily on the idea that in the\nplan of providence moral evil is defeated, rather than simply being\noutweighed by some good to which it is a means. The evil of sinful\nwilling is overcome when autonomy that is wrongfully exercised is\nsurrendered to God in repentance and conversion, or when the sinner is\nleft to the just deserts of willing to be separated from God. It may\nfairly be argued, however, that the defeat here pertains primarily to\nintrinsic moral evil \u2014 that is, to sinful willing itself \u2014\nrather than to the harm caused by it. Both conversion and reprobation\nmay refute the sinful will, but they do not seem to alleviate or\notherwise overcome the suffering caused by it. The idea of forgiveness\nmay address the latter to some extent, but it is not entirely clear\nhow. And even so, it may be claimed, much suffering is not, or at\nleast not obviously, the result of wrongdoing. The pains and anxieties\nof daily living would doubtless be lessened if wrongful willing did\nnot occur, but there would still be danger and disease, accidents,\nnatural disasters, occasional deprivation, the sufferings of old age,\nand eventual death. Theodicy has to deal with these evils too, and as\nin the case of sin, it will not do to claim simply that they lead to\nsome greater good that outweighs them. For as in the case of sin, the\nantitheist could then argue that God could as easily have created the\nworld so that the resultant good would be achieved by means that did\nnot involve suffering, or would simply appear without any means at\nall. How, then, might the theist respond here? Can the concept of\ndefeasibility be developed so as to cover suffering as well as\nsin?\n\nOne indication that it can is the disdain we would have for a world in\nwhich there were no suffering or hardship to be faced, but instead\nonly endless gratification. As usually formulated, the argument from\nevil is based on what appears to be a false presumption. It imagines\nthat the ideal world for a loving and compassionate God to create must\nbe what John Hick describes as a hedonistic paradise: a place devoted\nto human enjoyment, in which comfort and convenience are maximized,\nand pain and deprivation have little or no place (1966, 292\u201393).\nIf not banished completely, they must be held to the minimum necessary\nto guarantee to God\u2019s creatures the most pleasant existence\npossible. Now obviously, that is not the sort of world we have. The\namount of suffering is immense \u2014 far more, certainly, than it\nwould be if God\u2019s aim were to maximize worldly joy. But the\nappropriate conclusion, the theist may argue, is not that the universe\nis not the creation of a provident God. For consider how we react to\npeople whose lives have little to distinguish them except that they\nappear \u2014 perhaps deceptively \u2014 to be filled with\nenjoyment. There is a tendency, when we suffer one or another of\nlife\u2019s ills, to envy such people: to wish our own existence\ncould be as theirs seems to be, rather than the painful drudgery of\nthe moment. But the truth is that we seldom admire those who appear to\nhave a life of ease, nor are we likely to consider that kind of life\nvery well spent. What we admire are lives of courage and sacrifice:\npersons who overcome hardship, deprivation, or weakness to achieve\nsome notable success; who stand, perhaps not even successfully,\nagainst some great evil; or who relinquish their own happiness to\nalleviate the suffering of others. How would such lives be possible if\nnatural evil did not exist? (For a related view, see Swinburne\n1978.)\n\nStill less would we respect an entire world devoted to nothing but\nenjoyment. Imagine a society in which everyone has an electrode\nimplanted in their brain, which, when a current is passed through it,\ncauses intense euphoria, unmatched by any other pleasure. One simply\nneeds to be attached to a power source, and the simple push of a\nbutton yields ecstasy. And that is all anyone cares about.\nAgriculture, commerce, government, and social institutions are\norganized toward but one goal: to maximize the time each person can\nspend plugged in, lost in self-stimulation. Individual lives are\nconducted with the same aim. Work is still necessary, but it is held\nto a minimum, and contact with fellow human beings has no purpose\nother than to keep things running smoothly, so that the pleasure of\nall can be maximized. Now if the antitheist ideal of creation were\ncorrect, this type of society ought to represent a high order of human\nexistence \u2014 better by far than the world in which we presently\nfind ourselves. In fact, however, it is beneath contempt, a level of\nexistence so low as to be barely human. The enterprises we value most\nwould shrivel to near nothingness in such a world: there would be no\nart or culture, no important public works, little technology and\nscience \u2014 above all, no real human fellowship, no caring, no\nsacrifice (Hick 1966, 359\u201361). Perversely enough, in fact, all\nwe have to add to a world like this is war, and we get a situation not\nat all unlike Hobbes\u2019s state of nature, the very antithesis of\nanything we could value. Clearly, says the theist, we wish more for\nourselves than this. A life without challenge is a life without\ninterest.\n\nIf theism is correct on these matters, then a God interested in\ncreating the best of worlds cannot have as his top priority the\nmaximization of creaturely pleasure. Rather, a significant part of the\nenterprise of creation itself ought to be the confrontation and defeat\nof evil \u2014 an accomplishment far greater than merely guaranteeing\nthe unperturbed pleasure of all. And if human beings are created in\nGod\u2019s image, and called to friendship with him, it is to be\nexpected that they will have an important share in this enterprise.\nThe central role in every human life of the struggle against evil\nbears this out. The battle is fought within each of us: the foremost\nchallenge we face is that posed by our own sinfulness, which is\novercome when we acknowledge that control of our destiny lies finally\nwith God, and give up our false claim to ourselves. But for believers\nthat is by no means the end of the matter. In the wake of repentance\nthere should occur a gradual transformation of the individual, in\nwhich the damage wrought by sin is repaired, and the character traits\nappropriate for friendship with God are nourished. Remorse, anger and\nbitterness have to be replaced by gratitude, peace and hope; attitudes\nof failure must be supplanted by a sense of worth; rationalization has\nto give way to self-understanding. Above all, the believer has to\ndevelop such virtues as humility, patience, courage, and concern for\nothers \u2014 to give up selfishness in favor of charity. Hick calls\nthis process \u201csoul-making\u201d (1966, 289-97) In it, the\nindividual is transformed into a being suited for full friendship with\nGod, because through the achievement of virtue he is made over into\nGod\u2019s likeness. And much of the process takes place through our\nlearning to deal with natural evil, with pain, sorrow and deprivation,\nin ourselves and others. By having to cope with our own suffering, we\ndevelop peace, humility, perseverance, and trust in God. We also learn\nsympathy for others who suffer, and by working to improve their lot we\nestablish mercy and justice, in ourselves and in society. Indeed, much\nof human fellowship and solidarity is founded upon the support and\ncomfort we lend to each other in times of need, and in the common\nenterprises by which we seek to secure ourselves and one another\nagainst the depredations of natural evil.\n\nAccording to soul-making theodicy, then, by undergoing the soul-making\nprocess we develop the traits required for true friendship with God,\nin the only way that is suitable for humans. Some might object that\nGod could have created virtuous people without their having to go\nthrough the troubles that afflict our present existence, that\ndispositions to good behavior need not be established through\nsuffering (Mackie 1955, 205\u201306). Theists can respond, though,\nthat this objection fails to grasp the nature of soul-making. Human\nvirtues are not mere behavioral dispositions, of the kind found in the\ninanimate world. There are, no doubt, natural dispositions of\npatience, courage, kindness and the like \u2014 behavioral\npropensities we are born with, and that vary in strength from one\nindividual to another. But these are not what we have in mind when we\nspeak of moral virtue in the proper sense. True virtue has to be\ntested and refined. Someone with the virtue of patience must have\ntasted affliction and disappointment, and seen things through; the\ncourageous person has to have endured danger and risk; the\ncompassionate must have struggled with temptation, sorrow and\nhardship. The point of such experiences is not merely to strengthen\nour tendency to act rightly. Virtue is much more than an abiding\nbehavioral propensity. It is a matter of practical wisdom. It requires\nthat we know trial and suffering, and human weakness in the face of\nthem, in the only way they truly can be known: through experience.\nSuffering, like sin, cannot be understood in the abstract. Only first\nhand awareness of the world\u2019s pain enables us to comprehend\nfully the options for good and ill in the situations we face, to judge\ncorrectly what action is called for, and to perform it with an\nattitude of humble submission to God, and loving concern for others.\nIn short, true virtue requires knowledge of good and evil \u2014 not\njust as they are manifested in our own struggle with sin, but as they\nare played out in the travail of the whole world. As we gain this\nknowledge, we become more suited for God\u2019s friendship; indeed,\nthe process of gaining it is the beginning of the friendship. For to\naddress virtuously the hardships of life is not only to improve\nourselves; it is to take up the role God has planned for us in the\ncrucial creative enterprise of overcoming natural evil.\n\nSoul-making, according to its defenders, is not possible except\nthrough the experience of suffering. Because this is so, and because a\nworld in which humans are brought to spiritual maturity through this\nprocess is incomparably better than a hedonistic paradise, there is\nevery reason to expect that a perfectly good and loving God would\ncreate a world in which there is suffering. Still, the opponent may\nobject that this answer is at best incomplete. For, he will argue, not\nall of the suffering of the world enters into soul-making. Consider\nagain the case that was mentioned earlier, of the fawn caught in a\nforest fire. By and large, the sufferings of lower animals pass\nwithout even being remarked by rational beings, and seem to serve no\npurpose whatever. Even among humans, intense suffering is often\nfollowed simply by death, and contributes to no apparent moral\ndevelopment. Or, it may simply be that a person dies suddenly. What\nend of soul-making does that serve? And in any case, the complaint\ncontinues, surely the sheer amount of natural evil that\nexists in the world is incommensurate with the purposes described. In\nmuch of human pain and hardship we see little or nothing of the\nheroic, but only misery. Virtue is a fine thing, but could not God\nhave contrived to purchase it less expensively?\n\nIt is difficult for the theist to give a fully satisfying answer at\nthis point. Perhaps the best strategy is to invoke again the concept\nof defeasibility. For a theodicy that emphasizes that notion,\nGod\u2019s full purpose in creating a world that includes pain and\naffliction includes more than the spiritual maturation of his\ncreatures. Indeed, that effect is only concomitant to the objective\nthat is first and foremost: that evil be defeated. We should expect,\ntherefore, that evil will be found in the world to such a degree and\nin such variety as best to serve this overarching purpose. If anything\nless were so \u2014 if God, as creator, should shrink from some evil\nas too diabolical to be overcome, or too bitter to be endured \u2014\nhe would already have fled the field, and the battle would be lost\nbefore it had begun. But as to the actual degree and diversity of evil\nnecessary for its defeat, that is very difficult for humans to judge.\nOur perspective on creation is vastly incomplete, and in any case we\nhave no reason to expect to be privy to God\u2019s purposes regarding\neach detail of creation \u2014 especially, as we are about to see,\nwhen it comes to suffering. Still, some helpful points are available\nto the theist.\n\nFirst, as regards the claim that there is too much evil, or that much\nof it serves no purpose, it is not obvious that each instance of\nsuffering must be defeated separately from all others, or in the\nexperience of the individual who endures\n it.[9]\n The death of another can be as much a reminder to me of my finitude\nas my own impending death, sudden or lingering. The sufferings of\nothers \u2014 even of lower animals \u2014 can be effective in\narousing me to works of mercy and charity. Indeed, while particular\nacts of compassion must perforce be directed toward this or that\nspecific instance of suffering, the attitude of compassion is not. Its\nobject is all suffering, even suffering of which none but the\nsufferer will ever be specifically aware; and compassion can be\nawakened and reinforced by the very realization that much suffering\ngoes unnoticed and unrequited. The same goes for other virtues. We may\nbe prompted to greater efforts to secure justice in the world\nprecisely because we know that much injustice is never redressed; we\nmay seek to accomplish some difficult goal for which others suffered\nwithout success, and in whose memory we want to see it attained. One\nof the benefits of evil that seems unrequited, then, is that it\nelicits greater effort to deal with those ills we can address, and\ngreater urgency to assist the forgotten. In this sense, at least,\nthere is no such thing as suffering that serves no purpose.\n\nA second important point concerns the way in which suffering\nis defeated in the process of soul-making. It is not simply that it is\ncaught up in a larger process that is very good. That would be\ncompatible with suffering merely being outweighed in the larger\nprocess, or with it serving only as a causal means to the achievement\nof virtue \u2014 neither of which is enough to secure its defeat.\nRather, suffering is addressed in the process of soul-making and, as\nit were, refuted. To see how this occurs, we need to understand the\nnature of suffering. It is rarely a matter of sheer physical pain, and\neven when it is, we are often quite prepared to bear it. A distance\nrunner might endure a lot of pain, or a student considerable hardship,\nin pursuit of their goals. Yet both might maintain an optimistic\nspirit, and even deny they were really suffering. True suffering\noccurs when reason is left groping, and hope is called into question.\nWe suffer when pain seems too great to bear and to serve no\ncommensurate end: when the loss of a loved one leaves us dazed, empty\nand alone; when hateful assaults leave us feeling wounded and\nviolated; when we are distressed by disease, or the ravages of old\nage. Experiences like these tend to crowd all else out of our\nconsciousness. They make us feel dismayed, vulnerable and incomplete;\nthey make our projects appear trivial, our ambitions unreachable.\nAbove all, the experience undermines our confidence in the essential\ngoodness of the world, and our hope that all will be well. Indeed,\nwhat suffering does is to raise for each of us, in a way mere argument\ncannot, the problem of evil \u2014 and with it the inevitable\ntemptation to sullenness, self-pity, and enmity toward whatever God\nthere may be. But when we face the problem, and work through\nsuffering, it is defeated. The defeat can manifest itself in many\nways. Almost always, our capacity to endure future hardships, and to\ncomfort others in theirs, is increased. We may come to see more\naccurately our place in the universe, to deepen our devotion to God,\nto resolve to assist in attacking the sources of suffering, in human\nwrongdoing as well as the vagaries of nature. In all of this, the\ntheist may argue, natural evil is defeated: the very experience that\nthreatens to overwhelm confidence in the good becomes the\nindispensable foundation for attitudes of character that serve to\ndiminish its effects and aim at wiping it out. Above all, however,\nsuffering is defeated in the simple fact that it is borne with good\ngrace \u2014 that we refuse to submit to the temptation to descend\ninto repining and bitterness, and resolve instead to continue in hope.\nMuch of the heroism of those who suffer lies simply in this: that they\nstrive to go on \u2014 something even a fawn can do.\n\nThe problem of suffering is not just an intellectual challenge, but a\nmoral one as well. Evil calls for a certain reaction on our part, a\nreaction of striving, and it is defeated when that reaction occurs. It\nmade be protested that this reaction is available only to believers,\nand hence that this approach to the problem of evil begs the question.\nThat is not true. The theist is not required to produce a theodicy\nthat will work even if there is no God, only one that will work if\nthere is. And in any case, there seems to be no reason to think\nnonbelievers are precluded from participating in the defeat of evil.\nThey can and do gain from suffering much as believers do \u2014 even\nto the point of reacting to it with hope in the final goodness of\nthings, and with reverence for any source this goodness may have,\nwhatever its nature. It does have to be admitted, of course, that\nparticular instances of pain and misery do not always meet with a\npositive response in the sufferer. There may not be sufficient time,\nand when there is the individual may lack the intelligence or\nunderstanding to react in ways we would recognize. Where we do\nunderstand the reaction, there may be a mix between good and bad\nmanifestations of character. And of course there are cases where\nnatural evil is borne with anything but good will \u2014 with furious\nanger, or morose despair. Faced with this reality, the theist can only\npoint out what was mentioned above, that the evils which befall some\ncan and do work to encourage virtue in others, and this can occur by\nnegative example also. If this seems insufficient, the theist can\nargue that in a world where each an every instance of evil was\nthoroughly and obviously defeated \u2014 so that a perfectly\nsatisfying response to opponents of theism would always be available\n\u2014 an important dimension of evil would be missing. It is\nessential to the challenge of evil that it frequently appears\ngratuitous, that there seems to be too much of it, that as far as we\ncan see, it often goes\n unaddressed.[10]\n Anything less could not bring out the best in us. And then we would\nbe far less suited to God\u2019s friendship, and this world would be\nfar less than is needed for it to be a creation worthy of God: the\nbest of all possible worlds.\n",
