    "main_text": "A Feature of Momentary Experience || More Modest Roles for Experience\n1.3 More Modest Roles for Experience\n\nThe child acquiring the ability to refer to pleasure has more to go on\nthan the concept empiricist\u2019s untutored inward recognition when\nlearning to sort together sweets, hugs, and play and to name something\ncommon these typically cause or sustain. The great medieval lyric poet\nWalther von der Vogelweide paraphrases joy as \u201cdancing,\nlaughing,\n singing\u201d.[8]\n And Darwin writes, \u201cI heard a child a little under four years\nold, when asked what was meant by being in good spirits, answer,\n\u2018It is laughing, talking, and kissing.\u2019 It would be\ndifficult to give a truer and more practical\n definition.\u201d[9]\n As Darwin also observes, \u201c[W]ith all races of man, the\nexpression of good spirits appears to be the same, and is easily\n recognized.\u201d[10]\n The contrast with the negative affects develops very early in the\nexpressive behavior of the child and is also early and easily\nperceived. While a mature conception will distinguish behavioral\nexpression from its inward cause (as Walther does, in lines\n28\u201329, quoted in note 8), the very young child may possess a\nless differentiated conception in which the salient contrasts between\nsmiling or laughing and crying (Walther, line 29), and generally\nbetween the external expressions of the positive and negative affects,\nare prominent. Labeling and reporting one\u2019s own hedonic states\npresumably develop alongside attribution to others, from innately\nprepared capacities for affective feeling, expression, and perception\nthat must work together early to facilitate early emotional\ncommunication and bonding between infant and parent and, later, mutual\nunderstanding with\n others.[11]\n To a slightly older child, pleasure may signify at once feeling that\nis good and behavior expressing it and goodness of life no more than\nthese. From such a liberalized Lockean basis, not based solely or\nmainly in phenomenal similarity but not arrived at without experience,\na child may progress to a more mature conception of good and thence to\nthe common adult conception of pleasure as feeling that is good\n(Sidgwick, discussed in \u00a71.2, \u00b61; \u00a72.3.1, \u00b61; n.\n5, \u00b64; and n. 18) or at least naturally presents as such\n(Aristotle according to Moss, n. 7 above), with hedonic experience\nhaving had some place among these concepts\u2019 sources.\n\nSaving the core of the simple picture, pleasure as a relatively\nunmediated momentary experience, in some such way, however, may\nabandon the obviousness of pleasure\u2019s nature, goodness, and role\nin motivation that complete introspective transparency and\nintelligibility was supposed to provide. Experience of pleasure may\nthus play a role in allowing direct reference to pleasure and also in\nforming our concept of the good without its giving us any deep\nknowledge or justified confidence about either. Even whether there\nactually is such a kind as pleasure, as there appears to be, is open\nto refutation by new science. But if introspection is thus fallible,\nthen Sidgwick\u2019s failing to find a single feeling of pleasure,\nRyle\u2019s finding it a behavioral disposition, and Feldman a pure\npropositional attitude like belief (\u00a72.3.2) separable from having\nany feeling at all, are not decisive objections to pleasure feeling\nlike something or at least some things (Labukt 2012). The immediacy of\nphenomenal experience may not make for obviousness to cognition\n\u00a72.3.4, \u00b62), as on the full-blooded empiricist construal of\nthe simple picture. (For recent defenses of aspects of such an\nexperiential approach to pleasure, see, e.g., Crisp 2006, Labukt 2012,\nand Bramble 2013). \n\nThere may be reason, moreover, to believe introspection of affective,\nas opposed to, for example, sensory, experience, to be especially\nprone to errors of omission. Focal awareness of specific information\ncontent and the experience of affect have long been thought to compete\nwith each other\u00a0\u2013 and not merely as different sensory or cognitive\ncontents do. Competitive alternation between the two modes of\nexperience was a commonplace of past psychology and is receiving\nincreasing\n confirmation.[12]\n Ongoing research initiated by Marcus Raichle and his collaborators\nindicates default, resting state, or monitoring modes of brain\nactivity, perhaps including representations of one\u2019s current\nhedonic state, that are typically turned down by attention-demanding\ntasks (Gusnard et al 2001, Gusnard and Raichle 2004, Fox\net al 2005), perhaps even by some ways of attempting to\nintrospect one\u2019s current affective state. If so, the very\nfocusing of introspective scrutiny on pleasure provoked by the demand\nto accurately report it, may, thus, sometimes turn down the gain on\nsystems involved in representing it. If this is so, it may explain\nsome of the inconsistency of views mentioned in the previous paragraph\nand those of the 1930s introspectionist psychological laboratories (n.\n3) as well. However that may be, pleasure seems generally to attach\nattention and motivation to salient stimuli and especially toward ends\nit is pleasant to envision, rather than to itself (e.g., Schlick\n1930/1939, Ch.\u00a0II, \u00a7\u00a74\u201310, pp.\u00a036\u201355).\nSuch a perspective may answer the objection to experiential views of\npleasure that if pleasure were felt, it would divert our attention\nfrom what we are enjoying, such as music, to itself (Ryle 1954a,\nMadell (2002, pp.\u00a090\u201393). Pleasure may typically be easier\nto notice sideways than straight on. And as task demands increase,\nthese may degrade our ability to even cognitively notice our affective\nstate, so that the pleasure we phenomenally experience is out of (the\nlimited-capacity cognitive awareness of our) mind (cf. \u00a72.3.4,\n\u00b62).\n\nFrom a contemporary fallibilist perspective on introspection, we\nshould not then be surprised at its failures or take them to be\ndecisive against pleasure\u2019s being a single experiential kind, as\nSidgwick did. And even if it is not, the possibility of its containing\na limited heterogeneity remains (Labukt 2012, \u00a73.3 below).\nNeither should it be surprising that introspectionist psychologists\n(n.\u00a03, \u00b6\u00a03) and philosophers failed to agree on whether\npleasure has one phenomenal feel, a diversity, or none at all and that\nbodily sensations (which are not similarly resistant to inspection)\nmay show up instead. If diligent introspection of some kinds tends to\nmake momentary feeling cognitively inaccessible, then such\nintrospection will often be a worse guide than untutored experience\nabout it. Rather than relying exclusively on introspection (and\nunknowingly on the naive or trained intuitions and prejudices that may\nshape reports of it) we should bring the totality of our evidence to\nbear, drawing on psychology and biology as well as direct experience,\nas the best philosophers before the heyday of modern empiricism and\nintrospectionism did.\n",
