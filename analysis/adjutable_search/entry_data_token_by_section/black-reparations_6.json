    "main_text": "The Harm Argument\n7. The Harm Argument\n\n\nThree main objections have been urged against the harm argument\nagainst U.S. reparations to blacks. First, that although the\ntransgressions of slavery harmed the slaves, and present-day U.S.\nblacks do suffer from many disadvantages, these disadvantages may not\nbe the result of the transgressions of slavery; they could easily be\nthe result of vast economic and political changes that have occurred\nsince slavery ended. The present harms may not be the \u201cautomatic\neffects of slavery\u201d (Sher 1981: 7). Second, that even if present\nday U.S. blacks have been harmed by the slaveholders\u2019\ntransgressions against their ancestors, and have rights to reparations\nagainst these slaveholders, such rights can only be pressed against the\nslaveholders who are now all dead. Third that if present-day U.S.\nblacks demand reparations for the harms that the transgressions of\nslavery caused them, then since reparation implies compensation, they\ndemand to be made no worse off than they would have been had the\ntransgressions of slavery never occurred. But if these transgressions\nhad never occurred present-day U.S. blacks would not exist.\nConsequently, the harm argument is incoherent (Morris 1984, Levin\n1980).\n\nFullinwider reformulated the harm argument so that it avoids the\nfirst two objections. The reformulated argument goes as follows: the\nU.S. government after 1865 failed \u201cto vindicate the rights to\nfull and equal citizenship the Civil War Amendments extended to U.S.\nblacks;\u201d but, had that government \u201cvigorously\u201d\nprotected those rights, \u201cthe legacy of slavery would have faded\nconsiderably if not wholly by now through the industry of blacks\nthemselves\u201d. Consequently if present day blacks do suffer from\nvarious aspects of the legacy of slavery, the real cause of those harms\nis not slavery, but the U.S. governments after 1865, for if those\ngovernments had vigorously protected the rights of the freed people and\ntheir descendants, the legacy of slavery would have faded and present\nday U.S. blacks would not be disadvantaged by it (Fullinwider\n2004).\n\nBoris Bittker made a similar suggestion. His main argument is that\nhad the goals of Reconstruction not been foiled by the \u201cpolitical\nsettlement of 1877\u201d and the network of Jim Crow laws not been\nintroduced and finally fully authorized by Plessy v. Ferguson\nin 1896 the \u201conly identifiable residue of slavery today would\nhave been cultural\u201d, and the descendants of U.S. slaves and the\ndescendants of U.S. slaveholders would lead the same lives (Bittker\n2003: 12, 13). In other words, Bittker seems to go a little further\nthan the first one, suggesting that the legacy of U.S. slavery would\nhave disappeared completely if the U.S. government had protected the\nrights of the freed people and their descendants, the second line of\nreasoning too concludes that any responsibility for the legacy of\nslavery that persists today must be attributed to post Civil War\ngovernments.\n\nThese arguments of Fullinwider and Bittker are clear improvements on\nthe original harm argument. But they seem to assume that post-Civil War\ngovernments committed only one transgression against their black\npopulations, namely those governments failed to protect the civil\nrights of the members of those populations. In fact, however, these\ngovernments committed another and quite distinct transgression against\ntheir black populations; they failed to make reparations to those\npopulations. These two transgressions are not the same thing. The duty\nof government to protect its citizens\u2019 civil and political rights\nis one thing; its duty to pay and/or make reparations to them if it has\nwrongly injured them is quite another.\n\nFullinwider seems aware that protecting civil and political rights is\nnot the same as making reparations, that the U.S. government did not\nfulfill all of its obligations to the Japanese it interred during\nWorld War II just because it released them after the war and protected\ntheir civil and political rights after that. But some write as if they\nbelieve that the post-Civil War governments would have fulfilled all\nof their obligations to their black citizens if only they had\nprotected those citizens\u2019 civil and political rights\n(Fullinwider 2004: 148). Others write that compensation in\n1865 to the slaves for their forced or unpaid might have been\n\u201cstrong\u201d (Bittker 2003: 12), and that \u201ccompensation\nin 1865 for blacks\u2019 forced labor would certainly have been\nappropriate\u201d (Bittker 2003: 28). But having conceded that\nmonetary compensation would have been in order in 1865, Bittker then\ndrops the point without comment.  Interestingly, too, he seems to\nthink that unpaid labor is the only harm the transgressions of slavery\ncaused the slaves or that merits any mention. This is a strange\nposition to hold for a book titled The Case for Black\nReparations, for of course unpaid labor was perhaps the least of\nthe harms that the transgressions of slavery visited on the\nslaves. What about reparation for the theft of their liberty?\n\nBut the claim that \u201cHad the federal government done nothing\nafter 1865 except vigorously protect the civil and voting rights of\nblacks, the legacy of slavery would have faded considerably if not\nwholly by now through the industry of blacks themselves\u201d\n (Fullinwider 2004: 148) suggests that only the governments\u2019\nfailure to protect the civil and political rights of the freed people\nand their descendants caused any problem. An obvious difficulty with\nthis view is that large economic inequalities make it difficult for the\ngovernment to protect the rights of the poor. That problem aside, these\nauthors give no argument to support their view that the freed\npeoples\u2019 descendants would have recovered from the wrongful harms\nof slavery without the help of reparations if only government had\nprotected their civil and political rights. Fullinwider\u2019s\nconfidence seems to rest on the \u201cimmigrant model\u201d, by which\nis meant the path to success taken by the European immigrants who came\nto America after the Civil War, and with \u201clittle to offer but\ntheir physical labor\u201d, and \u201cby dint of hard work\u201d\neventually \u201cblended into the larger American fabric\u201d. The\nimplication is that the freed people were sufficiently like these\nimmigrants to justify the inference that had government vigorously\nprotected their civil and voting rights then they too by would have\nblended into the larger American fabric (Fullinwider 2004: 148).\n\nBut the freed people and their descendants were not very\nmuch like the white immigrants arriving from Europe. To say the\nobvious, slavery is very bad for people. It prevents them from\ndeveloping the useful dispositions and skills that people tend to\ndevelop in freedom. Although the immigrants had had a rough time in\nEurope\u2014that is why they flocked to America\u2014they were better\nprepared to take advantage of the opportunities available than the\nslaves. Consequently, they would likely have kept well ahead of the\nfreed people and their descendants even if the civil and political\nrights of each group were equally protected. The issue is debatable of\ncourse. Some black writers, Douglass, for example, seem to think that\nhuman beings are resilient, equipped as they are with an almost\nineradicable love of liberty, and consequently the slaves would recover\nreadily from the rigors of slavery if only they were given justice. He\nliked to say that all he asked for the Negro was \u201csimply\njustice\u201d, though the contexts always left it unclear how much he\nincluded in justice, whether it would involve reparation, and whether\nhe was simply denying that he was not asking for\n\u201cbenevolence\u201d or \u201cpity\u201d for the Negro (Douglass\n1865: 283). Alexander Crummell, on the other hand, seemed to worry\nabout the enduring effects of slavery especially because of the\ntendency of its victims to remember its horrors, though interestingly\nDouglass thought that these memories could be bracing (Crummell 1891:\n18, 19). The issue of the effects of the memory of enslavement and\ndomination on recovery from the effects of these evils deserves further\nstudy. Whatever the results of that study, however, it does not follow\nstraightaway that the wrongly injured are not owed reparations just\nbecause they are resilient enough to recover from the effects of their\ninjuries without it.\n\nEven if socio-economic advancement depends on informal contacts that\ninvolve the sharing and transfer of genuinely useful information and\nskills among people who enjoy what used to be called \u201csocial\nequality\u201d. But social equality cannot be secured by even the most\nrigorous protection of the civil and political rights of the freed\npeople; on the contrary such protection can help social inequality to\npersist since it entitles individuals to choose their friends and\nassociates even if their choice is determined by color prejudice. Since\ncolor prejudice remained strong after the Civil War the white\nimmigrants would more readily associate with well-placed and\nwell-educated locals and learn useful information and skills from them.\nFinally, since social equals tend to marry each other rather than their\ninferiors, and since immigrant whites were more likely than the freed\npeople and their descendants to become the social equals of prosperous\nnative whites, they were also more likely to marry such individuals and\nthus to gain access to their wealth, much of it incidentally inherited\nfrom the spoils of slavery.\n\nBittker seems aware that the official enforcement of civil and\npolitical rights might not nullify the effects of personal prejudice\nand asks whether \u201cpersonal\u201d prejudice without official\nsegregation would have produced segregation, \u201cfirst in the home,\nthen in Mrs Murphy\u2019s boardinghouse, and then in business and\npolitics\u201d. This issue is of decisive importance for the implied\ncontention that even without reparations blacks would have made\nthemselves equal to whites if there had been no Jim Crow\nlegislation. He rejects William Graham Sumner\u2019s maxim\n\u201claw-ways cannot alter folkways\u201d which implies that\nsegregation and prejudice could have persisted without the help of Jim\nCrow laws. However, there seems to be no argument to show that\nSumner\u2019s maxim is mistaken. Bittker takes it as a \u201cworking\nhypothesis\u201d that \u201cstatutes, ordinances, and other official\nactions have been the predominant source of the racial discrimination\nthat has blighted our public and private life,\u201d given that we\nhave no science \u201ccapable of producing a model of the United\nStates as it would have been if blacks had come here as voluntary\nimmigrants rather than as slaves, or if emancipation had been followed\nby an integrated society\u201d (Bittker 2003: 26).\n\nThe many and various considerations just canvassed conclude that it\nis too optimistic to suppose that the descendants of the freed people,\nwithout reparations, would have achieved parity with the descendants of\nthe white immigrants if only their civil and political rights had been\nprotected. In any case, the issue they raise is a distraction from the\ncentral question whether U.S. blacks are owed reparations. Achieving\nparity with the descendants of immigrants is not the same thing as\nreceiving the reparations one is owed. The point of reparations is not\nto make people equal to others; reparations is not defined as\nmaking the wrongly harmed equal to others. In fact, equality has little\nto do with reparations. People deserve reparations as a matter of right\nwhen they have been wrongfully harmed by transgression but a person may\nbe harmed as a result of transgression and may therefore have a right\nto reparations and yet be better off than others. Similarly, a person\nmay be worse off than others without having suffered from any harm or\ndisadvantage for which he deserves reparations. If reparations\nnecessarily requires compensation it requires that people be put as far\nas possible in the condition they would have been in had they not been\nwrongly injured. This may make them equal to others, but it may not. It\ncan leave them worse off than others and it can also make them better\noff than others. Some philosophers may protest that we should not allow\nclaims for reparations to get in the way of an ideal egalitarian\nsociety, but of course their position is as bad as the utilitarian\narguments they disparage that rights may and should be violated in\norder to maximize utility (Corlett 2010).\n\nBut it is now time to consider the third main objection to the harm\nargument. This objection, let us recall, is that making reparations to\nthe present U.S. black population for the harms that slavery caused it\nis impossible because if slavery had never occurred the present U.S.\nblack population would not exist. This problem is now known as the\nnon-identity problem. This difficulty might seem to reappear in the\nrevised harm argument just described. For although this argument does\nnot call for compensating the present U.S. black population for the\nharms that slavery caused it, it may seem to call for compensating the\npresent U.S. black population for the harms it suffers because of\npolicies enacted and enforced before it was conceived. Given that these\npolicies would have affected who was conceived in succeeding U.S. black\npopulations, had they not occurred the present U.S. black population\nwould not exist.\n\nThe following discussion shows how this difficulty can be avoided.\nImagine two slaves, Tom and Beulah released from slavery. They were\nreleased from slavery but the government continued to wrong them in at\nleast two ways: first, by preventing them from exercising rights\nguaranteed to every citizen; second, by violating their rights to be\ncompensated for the harms that it had caused them by supporting their\nenslavement. And both these wrongs probably harmed them. Obviously\npreventing them from voting or going to school probably harmed them;\nand the harm that often results when one\u2019s right to be\ncompensated is violated is an additional harm, on top of the harm\ncaused by the first violation of right. If you owe me a hundred dollars\nto compensate me for wrongly breaking my arm, you wrong me again by\nrefusing to give me what you owe me, and you might owe me another\nthousand dollars for the harms that second wrong might cause me, for\nexample going around for a month with the pain and inconvenience of an\nunfixed broken arm. Now the government wronged Tom and Beulah in the\ntwo ways mentioned as soon as it caused them to be released from\nslavery and before Beulah conceived any child; but it also continued to\nwrong them in these ways after the conception of their daughter, Eulah.\nThese wrongs to Tom and Beulah almost certainly harmed them by forcing\nthem to remain longer in the poverty and ignorance that slavery had put\nthem in. But it is more germane to the present argument that the wrongs\nalso almost certainly harmed their daughter Eulah. They harmed her by\nkeeping her parents in poverty and ignorance and by, therefore, also\nkeeping her in ignorance and poverty. They also harmed her by causing\nher to be raised by parents with the various disabilities that the\nexperience of slavery normally causes its victims. And if she acquired\nthese disabilities from her parents by imitation and necessity, and if\nthese disabilities harmed her, the government\u2019s wrongs caused\nthose harms too. If wrongdoers must make reparations for the damages\ntheir wrongdoing causes other people, then the government must make\nreparations to Eulah.\n\nThe argument is not that Eulah has a claim to the compensation her\nparents Tom and Beulah\u2019s were owed and never paid. If that were\nthe argument, we would have an inheritance argument, not a\ncounterfactual argument. Eulah\u2019s claim for compensation is for\nharms she herself suffered. And she can rightly press that claim\nagainst the government. It is not as though her parents could have done\nbetter by her but chose not to. The government\u2019s wrongs prevented\nthem from doing better by her. They had no choice but to raise her in\npoverty and ignorance. The government could have given them a choice if\nit had compensated for their wrongfully caused harms, or allowed to\nrecover from them. But it did not. Second, the amount of the\ncompensation she is owed does not depend on the amount of compensation\nthey were owed. It depends on the harms she suffered. Though she\nsuffered those harms because they were harmed and not compensated,\ncompensating her for her harms may be much more, (or much less), than\ncompensating them.\n\nThird, she may have an inheritance-based claim to their\ncompensation. The fact that she was harmed because they were not\ncompensated and can claim compensation for that harm does not mean that\nthey lose their claim to be compensated for their harms. If they were\nnever compensated she may therefore inherit a right to their\ncompensation. The counterfactual argument is compatible with the\ninheritance-based argument.\n\nFourth, her claim for compensation is not confounded by the argument\nthat she would not exist had the wrongs that caused her harms not\noccurred. Those wrongs are not the wrongs of slavery, which occurred\nbefore she was conceived, and indeed were among the causes of her being\nconceived. And they are not the wrongs that government committed\nagainst her parents after it released them from slavery and before she\nwas conceived. They are the wrongs that were all committed after her\nconception. They are the wrongs of not protecting her parents\u2019\nrights and failing to compensate them for the wrongs already committed\nagainst them. Had those wrongs not been committed, she would have lived\nin less straitened conditions, and would have been less constrained to\nimitate and duplicate her parents\u2019 slavery induced qualities and\nhabits.\n",
