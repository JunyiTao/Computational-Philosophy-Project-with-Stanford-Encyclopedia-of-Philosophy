    "main_text": "Empathy, Moral Philosophy, and Moral Psychology || Empathy, Its Partiality, Susceptibility to Bias, and Moral Agency\n5.3 Empathy, Moral Judgment, and the Authority of Moral Norms\n\nSo far, this entry has discussed mainly research exploring the\nrelation between empathy and prosocial/moral behavior or motivation.\nOther important areas for considering empathy\u2019s role in moral\nmatters have to do with addressing the questions of how and whether\nempathy contributes to our ability to distinguish between moral and\nconventional norms, to the making of moral judgments, and how empathy\ncan be appealed to in explicating the normative authority of such\njudgments. In considering the first question, psychologists and\nphilosophers have generally followed Turiel in understanding moral\nnorms as expressing concerns for \u201crights, justice, and the\nwelfare of other people\u201d (Turiel 1983, 3) and as having a very\nspecific \u201csignature response patterns\u201d (Kelly et. al.\n2007) associated with it. Moral norms are generally regarded to be\nmore important than conventional norms in that their normative\nvalidity is conceived as being independent of social authority or\nspecific social practices and agreements. Their scope is also judged\nto be much broader\u2014they are thought of to be valid in other\ncountries, for example\u2014, and violation of moral norms is\ngenerally understood to be a more serious offense than the violation\nof other norms. Notice however that in distinguishing between moral\nand conventional norms subjects do not necessarily associate a strict\nuniversality in the Kantian sense with moral norms and view them as\napplicable to all rational beings. Indeed there is some evidence that\n6\u20139 year old children, for example, view the moral/conventional\ndistinction as being fully applicable only to behavior of individuals\nin the in-group and view prescription against harming members of the\nout-group to be more like conventional norms (Rhodes and Chalik 2013).\nAccordingly, the fact that empathy shows considerable in-group bias,\nas discussed above, does not automatically count as evidence against\nit playing a role in allowing humans to distinguish between moral and\nconventional norms within a social context.\n\nOf central importance for assessing the role of empathy for grasping\nthe moral/conventional distinction has been the research on the nature\nof psychopathy and autism. Both pathologies are seen as involving\ndeficits in different dimensions of empathy but only psychopaths have\ngreat difficulties in living up to moral standards of their societies\nand only they were originally thought of as having difficulties in\nappropriately distinguishing between moral and conventional norms\n(Blair 1995 and 1996). More specifically, psychopaths show a selective\ndeficit in affective or emotional empathy particularly in\n\u201cprocessing fearful, sad, and possibly disgusted facial\nexpressions\u201d(Blair 2010, 710). In contrast to persons with\nautism they however do not show similar deficits in perspective taking\nor theory of mind capacities. In his 1995 article, Blair therefore\nblames the absence of what he calls the Violence Inhibition\nMechanism(VIM) that allows us to respond appropriately to the observed\ndistress cues in others for the psychopaths\u2019 moral deficits and\ntheir inability to draw the moral/conventional distinction. In his\nlater work, he speaks more broadly of a dysfunction of our Integrated\nEmotion System (IES), caused by a deficit in the amygdala to properly\nrepresent negative emotions. (Blair, Mitchel, and Blair 2005, for a\nrecent survey regarding the very specific deficit of psychopaths in\nfeeling and recognizing fear see also Marsh 2014). Yet one has to\ntread very carefully in drawing definite conclusions about the role of\nempathy for morality from the empirical research about psychopathy.\nThe results of the empirical investigations are far from unified and\ndo not point in the same direction (For a concise survey see Maibom\n2017). Newer studies, for example, seem to suggest that psychopaths,\nas measured by the overall score of the revised psychopathy checklist\n(PCL\u2013R), are able to understand the distinction between moral\nand conventional norms if tested under a forced choice paradigm\n(Aharoni et. al 2012.)Nevertheless even that study seems to allow for\nthe possibility that emotional deficits are responsible for the\npsychopath\u2019s shortcomings in accurately drawing the distinction\nsince they are somewhat linked to the affective and antisocial facets\nof the PCL\u2013R. Given the inconsistent results of the various\nstudies, other researchers prefer to view a psychopath\u2019s\nimmorality not as a specific deficit in empathy, but understand it to\nbe caused by their general inability to feel strong emotions, by their\ngeneral coldheartedness, or even by shortcomings in their rational and\nprudential capacities. From that perspective, a psychopath might\nunderstand in an abstract manner that certain things are morally wrong\nto do, but he just does not care for morality, the welfare of another\nperson, or even for himself. (For further discussion see Maibom 2005\nand 2009, Nichols 2004, and Prinz 2011a,b). Similar considerations\napply also to research regarding subjects with autism. Kennett\n(2002)has argued that evidence from autistic individuals, whose\nimaginative role-play and thus empathic capacities are diminished,\ndoes not support the claim that empathy is necessary for moral agency.\nYet in her arguments she only considers the fact that persons with\nautism have difficulties with putting themselves in another\nperson\u2019s shoes but does not consider that they seem to have some\nability to pick up on the emotional states of other people as revealed\nby their facial expressions. Moreover, while autistic subjects in\ngeneral can distinguish between moral and conventional norms they do\nseem to lack a certain flexibility in evaluating the seriousness of\nthe violation of a moral norm when they reflect on moral dilemmas or\nwhen they encounter an accidental or unintentional violation of such\nnorms. (See McGeer 2008, Zalla et. al 2011, but see also Kennett 2011\nand Leslie et. al. 2006 in response). \n\nPhilosophers have however not been merely be interested in appealing\nto empathy for explicating the psychological basis for our thinking\nthat certain norms have moral status. Within the general framework of\nmoral sentimentalism, which sees morality generally linked to our\nemotional responsiveness to the actions of others and ourselves, they\nhave also appealed to empathy in explicating more generally the nature\nof moral judgments (see also Kauppinen 2014 and 2017a). David Hume,\nfor example, has suggested that moral judgments are based on peculiar\nsentiments of moral approbations and disapprobation, which are\ncausally mediated by our ability to empathize\u2014 or what he called\nsympathy\u2014 with the pain and pleasures of others (See also\nSayre-Mcord 1994 and 2014). More specifically, sentiments of moral\napprobations arise in response to our ability to think about and\nenliven the pleasure and pain that others feel with the help of our\nempathic/sympathetic capacities when we consider the benefits (the\npleasure and pain) which a person\u2019s character traits and actions\nprovide to himself and others. Yet Hume was already quite aware of\nsome of the above mentioned limitations and biases of our natural\nwillingness and capacity to empathize with others. Accordingly, he\ninsisted that sentiments of approbations can only be conceived of as\nmoral approbation if empathy/sympathy is regulated or corrected by\nwhat he refers to as \u201csteady and general points of view\u201d\n(Hume 1739\u201340 [1978], 581/2) so that our capacity for sympathy enables us to\n\u201ctouch a string, to which all mankind have an accord and\nsymphony\u201d (Hume 1748 [1983], 75). There are certainly a number of\nissues that can be raised in response to Hume\u2019s proposal.\nSuffice it here to point out that it is difficult to fully understand\nhow Hume is ultimately able distinguish between judgments about\nsomething being bad and something being morally wrong. Certainly\nnatural disasters also cause us to sympathize/empathize with the pain\nit causes others, yet such sympathy is not mediating any judgments\nabout the moral impermissibility of natural disasters. Hume himself\nmight have thought to have solved this problem by thinking that\nsentiments of moral approbation have a peculiar or distinct character\n(see in this respect particularly Debes 2012). Yet pointing to the\npeculiarity of such sentiments seems to be rather unsatisfying for\nanswering this challenge. \n\nMichael Slote, one of the main contemporary proponents of the claim\nthat empathy plays a constitutive role for moral judgments, does not\nfollow Hume in thinking that empathy plays a moral role in allowing us\nto pick up on a subject\u2019s pleasure and pain. Rather Slote, who\nalso has been influenced by a feminist ethics of care (Slote 2007,\n2010), suggests that empathy is central for moral approval in that we\nas spectators empathically pick up on whether or not an agent acted\nout of empathic concern for another subject. Moral approval of an\naction consists then in the subsequent reflective feeling of warmth\nwhen empathizing with an agent\u2019s empathic concern, while moral\ndisapproval is equivalent with a reflective feeling of chill due to\nour recognition that the agent acted without any empathic concern.\nActions are then judged to be morally right or wrong in terms of\nwhether they can be conceived of the actions of an agent we would\nmorally approve of in that they are actions done out of empathic\nconcern. Notice also that while Slote does regard empathy in the above\nsense to be constitutive of moral approval only if it is fully or\nwell\u2013developed, he does not follow Hume in thinking that empathy\nneeds to be regulated in order to correct for some of its natural\npartiality. Indeed Slote thinks that this is a virtue of his account\nsince he regards such partiality reflected in our moral intuitions.\nFor example, he thinks that we have a greater moral obligation to help\nthe child in front of us or members of our family rather than people\nwho are more removed from us. Slote certainly deserves credit for\nreviving the debate about the role of empathy for morality in\ncontemporary metaethics. Yet his conception of the relation between\nempathy and morality has also encountered some skepticism. First of\nall, it is questionable that only motivations of empathic concern,\nrather than the thought that one is doing the right thing, constitute\nproper moral motivations. Second, in light of the above research on\nempathy\u2019s bias and natural shortcomings, it is rather\nquestionable to maintain that all aspects of empathy\u2019s\npartiality are sanctioned by our our moral intuitions. It is therefore\nhard to see how empathy\u2019s moral role can be justified without\nappeal to some form of corrective mechanism. Third, phenomenologically\nspeaking, moral disapproval is not necessarily based on a\n\u201cchilly\u201d feeling. At times we are rather upset and angry\nin encountering violations of moral norms. Finally, Slote\u2019s\nproposed empathic mechanism underlying moral approval seems to lack a\ncertain psychological plausibility. For Slote, we approve of an action\nbecause we recreate the empathic concern that the agent feels towards\nhis or her subjects and that causes us to feel warmly towards the\nagent. Yet if a positive moral judgment of an actions is tied to\nproviding us with the motivation or with a reason for doing a specific\naction, it is hard to see how moral approval, consisting in us feeling\nwarmly towards the agent, should help us accomplish this. If Slote is\nright, it would rather provide us with a reason for merely praising or\nbeing nice towards the agent (See D\u2019Arms 2011, Kauppinen 2014\nand 2017a, Prinz 2001a,b, and Stueber 2011c).\n\nThere is one additional element to consider when debating\nempathy\u2019s contribution to morality. Philosophers are not merely\ninterested in answering factual and causal questions of why we care\nabout morality, what causal role empathy plays in this respect, or how\nempathy causally contributes in allowing us to distinguish between\nmoral and conventional norms and judging what is morally right or\nwrong. Rather they are also interested in genuinely normative\nquestions in attempting to answer the question of why we should care\nabout morality and why we should regard moral judgments as making\nnormative demands on us. In morally blaming other persons we do assume\nthat we evaluate their behavior according to standards that they as\npersons are in some sense already committed to. We assume that these\nstandards are their own standards rather than standards that we impose\nfrom an external perspective on them. Unfortunately, even if one would\nagree with either David Hume or Michael\u2019s Slote\u2019s account\nof the causal role of empathy outlined above, it is doubtful that\ntheir account would help us to answer the genuinely normative question\nappropriately. Why exactly should I take a particular emotional\nreaction of another person towards me and my action, even if it is a\nfeeling of warmth caused by empathy, as something that is normatively\nrelevant for me. Certainly we all like to be liked and try to fit in\nwith our peer group, but then moral judgments would be nothing more\nthan a glorified form of peer pressure. Hume might respond that we\nshould take them seriously because they are responses from the general\npoint of view, but that in itself seems to be begging the question of\nwhy such perspective is articulating the appropriate normative\nstandard for judging our behavior and character. This is also exactly\nthe reason, why philosophers with Kantian inclinations have been in\ngeneral skeptical about moral sentimentalism and positions that think\nof empathy as a foundation of morality (for a nice explication of\nKant\u2019s critical view of sympathy see Deimling 2017).\nContemporary \u201cKantians\u201d do at times, however, admit that\nempathy and perspective taking is epistemically relevant for moral\ndeliberations, even if it is not solely constitutive for moral agency\n(Deigh 1996 and 2018; Darwall 2006, Shermann 1998, For a review see\nalso Oxley 2011). Interestingly, philosophers sympathetic to moral\nsentimentalism have particularly turned to Adam Smith for inspiration\nin developing empathy based accounts of morality and in responding to\nthe above normativity problem. In contrast to Hume, Smith conceives of\nempathy/sympathy not merely as the enlivening of a perceived emotion\nor feeeling but as imaginative perspective\u2013taking. In taking up\nanother person\u2019s perspective we put ourselves in his situation\nand imagine how he would respond to the situation, how he would think\nand feel about it. If in bringing another person\u2019s point of view\n\u201chome to ourselves\u201d in this manner, we recognize that we\nourselves might have felt or acted like the other person, then we\napprove of the other person\u2019s sentiment or action, otherwise we\ndisapprove. Moreover, such approval constitutes moral approval if we\nhave empathized with the other from the perspective of the impartial\nspectator, a perspective that Smith, like Hume, appeals to in order to\ncorrect for empathy\u2019s natural shortcomings. More importantly,\nsome authors think that within the Smithian framework we also find\nsome answers to the normativity problem. They think that the impartial\nspectator perspective can be recast as an implicit commitment of our\nordinary practice of making sense of each other as rational and\nemotional creatures with the help of empathic perspective taking\n(Stueber 2017) or argue that Smithian perspective\u2013taking\ninvolves quasi-Kantian commitments to the dignity of a person,\nincluding his or her affective dimension.
