    "main_text": "Moral Phenomenology and Metaethics || Moral perception\n2.1 Moral perception\n\nMoral perception has recently become a major topic of interest among\nanalytic philosophers and, in this sub-section, we will confine our\nremarks to how it has been discussed in such circles. In the following\nsub-sections, we focus primarily on the Phenomenological\ntradition.\n\nAs noted earlier, the phenomenological issue concerning moral\nperception is whether human beings can perceive instantiated moral\nproperties or relations, in the sense that such properties and\nrelations are presented in experience as part of the content of what\nan individual literally sees or hears (to pick two sense\n modalities).[11]\n\nTo clarify the topic under consideration, three comments are in order.\nFirst, our use of \u201cmoral perception\u201d in this sub-section\nis confined to modes of perception associated with the five senses\nplus proprioception and excludes consideration of other mental\nphenomena such as emotions which, on some accounts, are perceptual or\nquasi-perceptual states. (Moral emotions are taken up in the following\nsub-section.) Second, contemporary discussion of moral perception\ncenters on whether it is possible to perceive moral properties without\npostulating a special moral sense for detecting moral\n properties.[12]\n Third, it is assumed (though by no means uncontroversial) that\nperceptual experience has informational content understood as\nproviding accuracy conditions of one\u2019s perceptual experience,\nanalogous to truth conditions for beliefs (see the entry on the\n contents of perception).\n Thus, if I\u2019m having a visual experience as of a red object\nspatially located on the table in front of me, then my visual\nexperience includes as part of its content the presentation of the\nproperty redness and is thus accurate in this regard just in case the\nobject I am looking at is red.\n\nTurning now to moral perception, earlier we alluded to a now-famous\nexample from Gilbert Harman:\n\n\nIf you round a corner and see a group of hoodlums pour gasoline on a\ncat and ignite it, you do not need to conclude that what they\nare doing is wrong; you do not need to figure anything out; you can\nsee that it is wrong. (Harman 1977: 4)\n\n\nThere are at least two ways to understand Harman\u2019s remark. One\nmay take it as the claim that the property of wrongness is part of the\npresentational content of one\u2019s visual experience, alongside\none\u2019s visual experience of seeing the group of hoodlums pour\ngasoline on a cat and igniting it. This understanding commits one to\nwhat we will call the thesis of moral perception (MP, for\nshort) according to which at least some moral properties can figure in\nthe presentational contents of ordinary veridical perception. On this\nview, it is possible to see the wrongness of what those kids\nare doing. Moral perception is not restricted to visual perception,\nbut examples of such putative perception dominate the literature.\n\nAn alternative understanding of Harman\u2019s cat example is that one\ndoes not perceive the wrongness in question, rather what one sees in\nrounding the corner are the non-moral descriptive properties one\nwitnesses (e.g., the kids pouring gasoline) that spontaneously\ntriggers the response \u201cthat\u2019s wrong!\u201d However, the\nproperty of wrongness is not part of the content of one\u2019s visual\nperception. On this interpretation, then, saying that one sees\nthat what those kids are doing is wrong should be understood as a\nkind of intellectual seeing, i.e., a matter of intellectually (and, in\nthe example, spontaneously) apprehending the relation between what one\nsees and the wrongness of the act\u2014a mental act downstream (or at\nleast distinct) from one\u2019s visual experience.\n\nIn twentieth century analytic metaethics it was long accepted that\nmoral properties cannot be perceived, even if they are instantiated in\nactions, persons, institutions, and other items of moral evaluation.\nThus, we find W. D. Ross remarking:\n\n\nRightness is always a resultant attribute, an attribute that an act\nhas because it has another. It is not an attribute that its subject is\njust directly perceived in experience to have, as I perceive a\nparticular extended patch to be yellow, or a particular noise to be\nloud. (Ross 1939: 168)\n\n\nSuppose, following Ross, moral properties (assuming they are ever\ninstantiated) are higher-order resultant properties\u2014properties\nwhose instantiation depends on descriptive base properties. In this\npicture, it is in virtue of such descriptive properties as the\nhoodlums intending to torture the cat and igniting it that what they\nare doing instantiates the property of wrongness. Further, suppose\nRoss is correct in claiming that moral properties, even if they are\nsometimes instantiated, are not presented in visual experience (to\npick one sensory modality) as are low-level properties such as color\nand sound. Might it still be true that one\u2019s visual experience\nincludes as part of its presentational content resultant moral\nproperties even if they aren\u2019t perceived in the way one\nperceives color and sound? Recent work on perception gives the\ndefender of moral perception some reason to be optimistic.\n\nIn\n section 1.2\n on methodology, we mentioned the method of phenomenal contrast and\nhow it is used by some in defense of the rich content view of ordinary\nvisual perception. On this view, what is or can be presented in\nordinary visual experience is not restricted to lower-level properties\nsuch as shape, color, illumination, and motion, but may include the\npresentation of higher-level descriptive properties including object\nkinds, causal relations, and actions. (Siegel\u2019s pine tree\nexample is often cited as an example of how the method is deployed in\ndefense of the rich content view.) This recent development in the\nphilosophy of perception has figured in some recent defenses of\n MP.[13]\n\nThe question in the context of recent developments in the philosophy\nof perception, then, is whether this rich content view can be extended\nto moral properties\u2014higher-order normative moral\nproperties (and perhaps to normative and evaluative properties\ngenerally). The matter is controversial, as one might expect. For\nexample, Preston Werner (2016) employs the contrast method\n(\u00e0 la Siegel) in defense of MP. He considers two\nindividuals witnessing the Harman cat incident and differing in their\noverall resulting phenomenology because one of them (Pathos) lacks the\ncapacity for emotional empathic responses to cases like Harman\u2019s\ncat that the other person (Norma) has. Werner then proceeds to argue\nthat from among the candidate explanations for the interpersonal\ndifference in the experiences of Pathos and Norma, the hypothesis that\nthe visual experience of Norma includes as part of its presentational\ncontent the property of wrongness (presumably not present in the\nvisual experience of Pathos) best explains the phenomenological\ndifference in question. Werner\u2019s defense of MP is opposed by\nPekka V\u00e4yrynen (2018) who advances a two-pronged reply. First,\neven if Norma\u2019s experience of witnessing the cat immolation\nincludes a presentation of the property of wrongness as part of the\ncontent of her overall experience, Werner\u2019s argument\ndoes not show that the property is an element of the presentational\ncontent of her visual experience that is included as a part\nof her overall experience, i.e., it doesn\u2019t show that she\nsees the wrongness. Second, V\u00e4yrynen proposes a\ncompeting hypothesis according to which Norma undergoes a spontaneous\ninferential transition from non-moral perceptual input (together with\nbackground beliefs with moral content, training, and habituation) to\nher moral judgment about the hoodlums (this spontaneous response\nlacking in Pathos). He then argues that this hypothesis is overall\nsimpler, more unified, and enjoys greater explanatory power compared\nto the MP hypothesis. (For pertinent details, readers may consult the\narticles by Werner and V\u00e4yrynen.) This particular dispute, we\nnote, is far from settled; questions may be raised about the alleged\nsuperiority of V\u00e4yrynen\u2019s proposal over MP.\n\nFurther questions about moral perception loom large, including whether\nso-called thick moral properties, e.g., honesty, are better candidates\nfor figuring in the presentational contents of perceptual experiences\nthan are \u201cthin\u201d moral properties like rightness and\nwrongness. After all, concepts like honesty are at least partly\ndescriptive (making them \u201cthick\u201d) and partly evaluative or\nnormative. For instance, knowingly witnessing someone\u2019s action\nof interpersonal verbal communication as honest is (in part) to be\npresented with specific descriptive information about the\naction\u2014that it was neither a lie nor in some way deceptive. As\nsuch, the property of honesty is capable of being presented\nauditorily. Insofar as honesty is a right-making property of actions,\nexperiencing the honesty with the understanding that it is\nright-making, would seem to be a case of experiencing a moral\nproperty; the moral property is presented in experience by way of its\ndescriptive content.\n\nAnother looming question is whether one would be able to perceive\nmoral properties were they non-natural properties. Robert Audi (2013),\nfor example, defends a non-naturalist view of moral properties as\nbeing (in his terminology) \u201cperceptible\u201d. (See Crow 2016\nfor a critical discussion of Audi and related views of moral\nperception.) Finally, another question, fundamental to the debate over\nthe thesis of moral perception, is whether it is possible to determine\nby introspectionist methodology alone (including the method of\ncontrast) whether at least some perceptual experiences include as part\nof their content the presentation of moral properties\u2014whether as\nTerry Horgan and Mark Timmons put it, such experiences have\n\u201crealist purport\u201d. In a series of articles (2008b, 2010b,\n2017, 2018a,b, 2019), they defend a \u201cneutrality thesis\u201d\naccording to which for a variety of types of moral experience it is\nnot possible to determine by introspectionist methodology\nalone whether such experiences have realist purport. Their\npoint, if cogent, arguably generalizes to all types of moral\nexperience, including perceptual experience of the sort featured in\nHarman\u2019s cat example, even if such experiences do have realist\npurport.\n\nIn the remainder of this section, our central focus will be on the\nPhenomenological tradition, with some mention of the work by analytic\nphilosophers.\n",
