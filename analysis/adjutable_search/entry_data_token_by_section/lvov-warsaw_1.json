    "main_text": "Metaphilosophy\n2. Metaphilosophy\n\nMost philosophers of the LWS understood philosophy as a collection of\ndisciplines, including logic, ethics, aesthetics, metaphysics, and\nepistemology. Philosophy is a science, like any other. All members of\nthe LWS inherited from Twardowski his main metaphilosophical claims\nconcerning clarity, justification and the separation of philosophy\nfrom world-views. It also meant a radical rejection of all kinds of\nirrationalism. A view, called anti-irrationalism by Ajdukiewicz,\ndemanded that every rationally accepted proposition be\nintersubjectively communicable and testable. Although there was no\na priori list of meaningful questions subjected to\nphilosophical work, one should be sceptical about so-called great\nmetaphysical problems and their scientific status. Philosophical\nactivity must begin with a very careful linguistic analysis of\ninvestigated problems and their meaning.\n\nTwardowski himself favoured descriptive psychology as basic, but many\nof his students found logic to be the most important source of\nmethodological criteria for philosophy. Perhaps \u0141ukasiewicz was\nthe most radical in this respect. According to him, a reform of\nphilosophy was needed in order to avoid errors of the past. Philosophy\nshould proceed as logic does, axiomatically starting from clear\nconcepts and evident principles. Other philosophers of the LWS were\nmore modest and did not demand that philosophy should be axiomatized.\nHowever, logical analysis of philosophical discourse became the\nstandard method of analysis. Yet the task of philosophy is not limited\nto the analysis of language. Thus, philosophy, according to\nmethodological claims of the LWS, was analytic but not purely\nlinguistic. Philosophy is concerned with the world but it mainly\n(though not \u2018only\u2019) performs its task also by the analysis\nof language, which is used in speaking about reality. This view about\nphilosophy is to be contrasted with that of the Vienna Circle. In\nparticular, the LWS was not interested in a general metaphilosophical\nscheme that sharply divided philosophy into good and bad, but rather\nwith an analysis of concrete problems. Thus, the LWS was united more\nby a common methodological attitude and very general claims concerning\nrationality than by a commonly accepted philosophical theory.\n\nHowever, some general views were shared by most (\u2018most\u2019 is\nvery important here) members of the LWS. These include:\nanti-scepticism, anti-naturalism in humanities and axiology, realism\nin epistemology and philosophy of science, absolutism in epistemology\nand axiology, and empiricism. These views were characteristic for\nBrentano and became implemented in Polish philosophy by\nTwardowski.\n",
