    "main_text": "Some Preliminary Clarifications || Foundational and Non-foundational Pluralism\n1.1 Foundational and Non-foundational Pluralism\n\nIt is important to clarify the levels at which a moral theory might be\npluralistic. Let us distinguish between two levels of pluralism:\nfoundational and non-foundational. Foundational pluralism is the view\nthat there are plural moral values at the most basic level\u2014that\nis to say, there is no one value that subsumes all other values, no\none property of goodness, and no overarching principle of action.\nNon-foundational pluralism is the view that there are plural values at\nthe level of choice, but these apparently plural values can be\nunderstood in terms of their contribution to one more fundamental\n value.[3]\n\nJudith Jarvis Thomson, a foundational pluralist, argues that when we\nsay that something is good we are never ascribing a property of\ngoodness, rather we are always saying that the thing in question is\ngood in some way. If we say that a fountain pen is good we mean\nsomething different from when we say that a logic book is good, or a\nfilm is good. As Thomson puts it, all goodness is a goodness in a way.\nThomson focusses her argument on Moore, who argues that when we say\n\u2018x is good\u2019 we do not mean \u2018x is\nconducive to pleasure\u2019, or \u2018x is in accordance\nwith a given set of rules\u2019 and nor do we mean anything else that\nis purely descriptive. As Moore points out, we can always query\nwhether any purely descriptive property really is good\u2014so he\nconcludes that goodness is simple and\n unanalyzable.[4]\n Moore is thus a foundational monist, he thinks that there is one\nnon-natural property of goodness, and that all good things are good in\nvirtue of having this property. Thomson finds this preposterous. In\nThomson\u2019s own words:\n\nMoore says that the question he will be addressing himself to in what\nfollows is the question \u2018What is good?\u2019, and he rightly\nthinks that we are going to need a bit of help in seeing exactly what\nquestion he is expressing in those words. He proposes to help us by\ndrawing attention to a possible answer to the question he is\nexpressing\u2014that is, to something that would be an answer to it,\nwhether or not it is the correct answer to it. Here is what he offers\nus: \u201cBooks are good.\u201d Books are good? What would you mean\nif you said \u2018Books are good\u2019? Moore, however, goes\nplacidly on: \u201cthough [that would be] an answer obviously false;\nfor some books are very bad indeed\u201d. Well some books are bad to\nread or to look at, some are bad for use in teaching philosophy, some\nare bad for children. What sense could be made of a person who said,\n\u201cNo. no. I meant that some books are just plain bad\nthings\u201d? (Thomson 1997, pp. 275\u2013276)\n\n\nAccording to Thomson there is a fundamental plurality of ways of being\ngood. We cannot reduce them to something they all have in common, or\nsensibly claim that there is a disjunctive property of goodness (such\nthat goodness is \u2018goodness in one of the various ways\u2019.\nThomson argues that that could not be an interesting property as each\ndisjunct is truly different from every other disjunct. Thomson (1997),\np. 277). Thomson is thus a foundational pluralist\u2014she does not\nthink that there is any one property of value at the most basic\nlevel.\n\nW.D. Ross is a foundational pluralist in a rather complex way. Most\nstraightforwardly, Ross thinks that there are several prima facie\nduties, and there is nothing that they all have in common: they are\nirreducibly plural. This is the aspect of Ross\u2019s view that is\nreferred to with the phrase, \u2018Ross-style pluralism\u2019.\nHowever, Ross also thinks that there are goods in the world (justice\nand pleasure, for example), and that these are good because of some\nproperty they share. Goodness and rightness are not reducible to one\nanother, so Ross is a pluralist about types of value as well as about\nprinciples.\n\nWriters do not always make the distinction between foundational and\nother forms of pluralism, but as well as Thomson and Ross, at least\nBernard Williams (1981), Charles Taylor (1982), Stuart Hampshire\n(1983), Charles Larmore (1987), John Kekes (1993), Michael Stocker\n(1990 and 1997), David Wiggins (1997), Christine Swanton (2001), and\nJonathan Dancy (2004) are all committed to foundational pluralism.\n\nNon-foundational pluralism is less radical\u2014it posits a plurality\nof bearers of value. In fact, almost everyone accepts that there are\nplural bearers of value. This is compatible with thinking that there\nis only one ultimate value. G.E. Moore (1903), Thomson\u2019s target,\nis a foundational monist, but he accepts that there are\nnon-foundational plural values. Moore thinks that there are many\ndifferent bearers of value, but he thinks that there is one property\nof goodness, and that it is a simple non-natural property that bearers\nof value possess in varying degrees. Moore is clear that comparison\nbetween plural goods proceeds in terms of the amount of goodness they\nhave.\n\nThis is not to say that the amount of goodness is always a matter of\nsimple addition. Moore thinks that there can be organic unities, where\nthe amount of goodness contributed by a certain value will vary\naccording to the combination of values such as love and friendship.\nThus Moore\u2019s view is pluralist at the level of ordinary choices,\nand that is not without interesting consequences. (We return to the\nissue of how a foundational monist like Moore can account for organic\nunities in section 3.)\n\nMill, a classic utilitarian, could be and often has been interpreted\nas thinking that there are irreducibly different sorts of pleasure.\nMill argues that there are higher and lower pleasures, and that the\nhigher pleasures (pleasures of the intellect as opposed to the body)\nare superior, in that higher pleasures can outweigh lower pleasures\nregardless of the quantity of the latter. As Mill puts it: \u201cIt\nis quite compatible with the principle of utility to recognize the\nfact, that some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable\nthan others.\u201d (2002, p. 241). On the foundational pluralist\ninterpretation of Mill, there is not one ultimate good, but two (at\nleast): higher and lower pleasures. Mill goes on to give an account of\nwhat he means:\n\nIf I am asked, what I mean by difference in quality in pleasures, or\nwhat makes one pleasure more valuable than another, merely as a\npleasure, except its being greater in amount, there is but one\npossible answer. Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or\nalmost all who have experience of both give a decided preference,\nirrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is\nthe more desirable pleasure. (2002, p. 241).\n\n\nThe passage is ambiguous, it is not clear what role the expert judges\nplay in the theory. On the pluralist interpretation of this passage we\nmust take Mill as intending the role of the expert judges as a purely\nheuristic device: thinking about what such people would prefer is a\nway of discovering which pleasures are higher and which are lower, but\nthe respective values of the pleasure is independent of the\njudges\u2019 judgment. On a monist interpretation we must understand\nMill as a preference utilitarian: the preferences of the judges\ndetermine value. On this interpretation there is one property of value\n(being preferred by expert judges) and many bearers of value (whatever\nthe judges\n prefer).[5]\n\nBefore moving on, it is worth noting that a theory might be\nfoundationally monist in its account of what values there are, but not\nrecommend that people attempt to think or make decisions on the basis\nof the supervalue. A distinction between decision procedures and\ncriteria of right has become commonplace in moral philosophy. For\nexample, a certain form of consequentialism has as its criterion of\nright action: act so as to maximize good consequences. This might\ninvite the complaint that an agent who is constantly trying to\nmaximize good consequences will often, in virtue of that fact, fail to\ndo so. Sometimes concentrating too hard on the goal will make it less\nlikely that the goal is achieved. A distinction between decision\nprocedure and right action can provide a response\u2014the\nconsequentialist can say that the criterion of right action, (act so\nas to maximize good consequences) is not intended as a decision\nprocedure\u2014the agent should use whichever decision procedure is\nmost likely to result in success. If, then, there is some attraction\nor instrumental advantage from the point of view of a particular\ntheory to thinking in pluralist terms, then it is open to that theory\nto have a decision procedure that deals with apparently plural values,\neven if the theory is monist in every other way.\n [6]\n",
