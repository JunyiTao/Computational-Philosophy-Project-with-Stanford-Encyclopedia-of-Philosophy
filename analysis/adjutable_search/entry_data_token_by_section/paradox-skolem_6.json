    "main_text": "Mathematical Issues || Four Final Points\n2.5 Four Final Points\n\n\nWe close this discussion of the mathematical side of Skolem's\nParadox with four final points. First, the discussion in 2.3\u20132.4\nfocused on the transitive submodel case of Skolem's Paradox. This case\nis relatively straightforward to analyze, and (so) it's the case that's\nbeen most widely discussed in the literature. But it can also be\nsomewhat misleading. Much of the analysis of 2.3\u20132.4 turned on\nthe fact that transitive models get a lot of things \u201cright\u201d\nabout the set-theoretic universe (membership, bijections, real numbers,\netc.). Most importantly, if M is transitive and\nm \u2208 M, then m =\n{m\u2032 \u2208 M\n\u2009|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\nm\u2032 \u2208 m\u2009}.\n\n\nIf M is not transitive, however, then nearly all of\nthis falls apart. Bays has argued that there are versions of Skolem's\nParadox which turn solely on the way certain non-transitive\nmodels interpret a few specific instances of the membership relation in\n\u03a9(x) (Bays 2007a, sections 4\u20135). Similar\npoints would carry over to our discussion of power sets and real\nnumbers in section 2.4. We can, for instance, find a countable model of\nZFC which contains the whole set of real numbers as a member\u2014the\nmodel remains countable only because\n \u211c \u2260\n {m\u2009|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\n m \u2208\n \u2009\u211c} (Benacerraf 1985; Bays 2007a, section 1). In short, although\nthe generic explanation of Skolem's Paradox that was given in section\n2.2\u2014the one which simply notices that there are some\ndifferences between the model-theoretic and the ordinary English\ninterpretations of \u03a9(x) and then chalks Skolem's\nParadox up to some kind of equivocation between these two\ninterpretations\u2014continues to hold up when we move to\nnon-transitive models, the more-detailed analyses of 2.3\u20132.4 all\nbreak down. In the general non-transitive case, therefore, the analysis\nof section 2.2 may be the best we can do in giving an explanation of\nSkolem's Paradox (which is not to say that we can't give more-detailed\nexplanations in the context of any particular non-transitive\nmodel).\n\n\nThis brings us to a second point. Skolem's Paradox depends crucially\nupon the fact that we're using a first-order axiomatization of\nset theory. More precisely, it depends upon the fact that we're using\nfirst-order model theory to interpret this axiomatization. In 1930,\nZermelo proved that (second-order) models of second-order ZFC compute\ncardinalities and power sets\n correctly.[28]\n In particular, then, if M\nis a model for second-order ZFC and if\n m\u02c6\n \u2208 M, then M\n \u22a8\n \u201cm\u02c6\n is uncountable\u201d if and only \nif {m\u00a0|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\n m \u2208\n m\u02c6\u2009}\n really is uncountable. Hence, Skolem's Paradox doesn't arise in the second-order\ncontext (Zermelo 1930; Shapiro 1991).\n\n\nThis second point shows that Skolem's Paradox goes away if our logic\nis strong enough. The third point shows that weakening our\nlogic has a similar effect. In Tennant and McCarty 1987, Tennant and\nMcCarty show that standard proofs of the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem\nfail in constructivist set theory, and they argue that the theorem\nitself is probably constructively\n invalid.[29]\n This means that there's no way to generate\nSkolem's Paradox from within the framework of constructivist\nmathematics. For constructivists, therefore, as for those who are\nwilling to countenance second-order axiomatizations of set theory,\nSkolem's paradox simply doesn't arise.\n\n\nTogether, these last two points highlight just how central classical\nfirst-order logic is to Skolem's Paradox. From a mathematical\nstandpoint, this shouldn't be all that surprising. Lindstrom has shown\nthat the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems play a key role in\ncharacterizing first-order logic itself (Lindstr\u00f6m 1966;\nLindstr\u00f6m 1969; Ebbinghaus 2007). Given this, it should be\nunsurprising that the puzzle that's most closely associated with these\ntheorems also turns out to be tied pretty closely to the peculiarities\nof the first-order situation. Although, as we've seen, the paradox\ndoesn't constitute a straightforward mathematical contradiction, it\ndoes help us to understand the nature and limits of classical\nfirst-order logic.\n\n\nThis brings us to a final point. The above discussion explains why\nthose of us who are willing take a naively realistic attitude towards\nthe language of set theory\u2014e.g., those of us who have no qualms\nabout expressions like \u201cthe ordinary English interpretation of\n\u03a9(x)\u201d\u2014should remain untroubled by\nSkolem's Paradox. It's important to emphasize that this analysis\nalso explains why Skolem's Paradox doesn't introduce\ncontradictions into various forms of axiomatized set theory, even when\nthese axiomatizations are themselves understood formalistically or\nmodel-theoretically. From a proof-theoretic standpoint, for example,\nthere is a difference between unrelativized quantification and\nquantification which has been explicitly relativized to some formula in\nour language (where this formula is one that, from an intuitive\nperspective, serves to \u201cpick out\u201d the domain of countable\nmodel of ZFC). So, there's no a priori reason to think that a\nsentence with unrelativized quantifiers will conflict with that\nsentence's fully-relativised\n counterpart.[30]\n Similarly, from a model-theoretic\nperspective, there is a difference between quantifiers which range over\nthe whole domain of a model and quantifiers which only range over the\n\u201celements\u201d of some particular member of the model (where,\nonce again, this member is one which the larger model\n\u201cthinks\u201d is a model of ZFC). So, although the naive realism\nof sections 2.1\u20132.4 is useful for expository purposes, it's not\nessential to the underlying analysis of Skolem's Paradox.\n",
