    "main_text": "What is an Abstract Object? || Eliminativism\n4. Further Reading\n\nBerto & Plebani (2015) provide an useful introduction to ontology\nand metaontology. Putnam (1971) makes the case for abstract objects on\nscientific grounds. Bealer (1993) and Tennant (1997) present a\npriori arguments for the necessary existence of abstract\nentities. Fine (2002) systematically studies of abstraction principles\nin the foundations of mathematics. Wetzel (2009) examines the\ntype-token distinction, argues that types are abstract objects while\nthe tokens of those types are their concrete instances, and shows how\ndifficult it is to paraphrase away the many references to types that\noccur in the sciences and natural language. Zalta (2020) develops a\ntype-theoretic framework for higher-order abstract objects (which\nincludes abstract properties and abstract relations in addition to\nordinary properties and relations) and offers both comparisons to\nother type theories and applications in philosophy and linguistics.\nMoltmann (2013) investigates the extent to which abstract objects are\nneeded when developing a semantics of natural language; in this book,\nand also in her article (2020), she defends a\n\u2018core-periphery\u2019 distinction and suggests that natural\nlanguage ontology contains references to abstract objects only in its\nperiphery. Falguera and Mart\u00ednez-Vidal (2020) have edited a\nvolume in which contributors present positions and debates about\nabstract objects of different kinds and categories, in different\nfields in philosophy.\n",
