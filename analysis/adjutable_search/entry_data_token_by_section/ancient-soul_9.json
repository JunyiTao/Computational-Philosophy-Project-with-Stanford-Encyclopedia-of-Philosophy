    "main_text": "Hellenistic Theories of Soul || The Stoic Theory of Soul\n6. Conclusion\n\n Ancient philosophy did not, of course, end with classical Stoicism,\nor indeed with the Hellenistic period, and neither did ancient\ntheorizing about the soul. The revival of interest in the works of\nboth Plato and Aristotle beginning in the second half of the second\ncentury B.C.  prominently included renewed interest in Platonic and\nAristotelian conceptions of the soul, sparking novel theoretical\ndevelopments, such as, for instance, Plotinus' argument (directed in\nparticular against the Stoics) that the soul could not be spatially\nextended, since no spatially extended item could account for the unity\nof the subject of sense-perception (see Emilsson 1991).  Christian\nwriters such as Clement of Alexandria and Gregory of Nyssa were\nheavily indebted to philosophical theories of soul, especially\nPlatonic ones, but also introduced new concerns and interests of their\nown. Nevertheless, these and other post-classical developments in\nevery case need to be interpreted within the framework and context\nfurnished by the classical theories that we have been considering in\nsome detail.\n",
