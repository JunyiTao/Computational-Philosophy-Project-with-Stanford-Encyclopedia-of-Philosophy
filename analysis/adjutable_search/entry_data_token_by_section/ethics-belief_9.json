    "main_text": "Belief, its Aims, and Our Control Over It || Belief-control\n3.4 Belief-control\n\nA third foundational issue related to the nature of belief has to do\nwith whether or not belief-formation is in some way voluntary or under\nthe control of the will. This issue, too, has an effect on the ethics\nof belief. Many philosophers and psychologists have concluded that\nbelief is a more or less involuntary response to perceived evidence.\nBut if a behavior isn't \u2018up to us\u2019 in any important sense,\nthen it is hard to see how we could be responsible for performing it\n(see Alston 1989 for an influential argument along these lines).\n\nIn response to this \u201cdoxastic involuntarist\u201d challenge ,\nsome philosophers argue that we do have direct control over at least\nsome of our beliefs (Ginet 2001, Weatherson 2008), or that we at least\nhave control over which beliefs are suspended or relinquished (Rott\nforthcoming). Others develop a kind of hybrid view that allows certain\nkinds of belief-formation to count as free and \u2018up to us,\u2019\neven if they are also caused in us (see Steup 2000, Ryan 2003). Some\nexplicitly reject any parallel between free will and free belief\n(Wagner forthcoming). Still others focus on the fact that we can be\npraised and blamed for beliefs (as well as actions) that are not under\nour control, even if there are no obligations on belief-formation.\n(Adams 1985, Hieronymi 2006, Southwood and Chuard 2009). \n\nYet another response, compatible with many of those list above,\ninvolves an account of indirect ways in which\nbelief-formation counts as voluntary and thus susceptible to normative\nevaluation (e.g., Pascal 1670, Feldman 2000, Audi 2001, Yee 2002, Leon\n2002, Audi 2008b). Another option is to take the doxastic\ninvoluntarist challenge to motivate a new focus on positive\npropositional attitudes that are by definition voluntary\n\u2013 \u201cacceptances,\u201d for instance (see Cohen 1992,\nBratman 1992, Engel 2000, Audi 2008a, and \u00a77 below). Finally,\nsome ethicists of belief seek to argue that there are some\nobligations on direct belief-formation while also absorbing the\nputative empirical datum that much of it is not under the control of\nthe will (see Feldman and Conee 1985, Feldman 2000, Adler 2005,\nHieronymi 2006 and 2008).\n",
