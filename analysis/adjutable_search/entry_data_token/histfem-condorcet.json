Through educational and\nconstitutional reforms, he hoped to create a liberal, rational and\ndemocratic polity. He advocated for the social utility of statistics\nand probability theory, and he applied mathematical calculations to\nfiscal crises, the reform of hospital care, jury decision-making and\nvoting procedures. He is best remembered as the author of the\nposthumously published final work Esquisse d\u2019un tableau historique\nde l\u2019esprit humain [Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Human\nMind] (1794), in which he diagnosed the stages of human progress,\nincluding what was yet to come. However, far less well known is\nCondorcet\u2019s extraordinary advocacy of the rights of\n women.[2]\n In this regard, he was exceptional even for an enlightened\n thinker.[3]\n\nWhat Condorcet termed, in a 1790 essay by that name, \u201cthe\nadmission of women to the rights of citizenship\u201d was widely\nopposed on the grounds that women possessed distinctive natures, which\nperfectly suited them to the fulfillment of their domestic\n duties.[4]\n Women were deemed unqualified for the realm of public affairs because\nof their alleged greater susceptibility to sensations, flawed\nrationality, and weaker sense of justice. Women did not get the vote\nduring the French Revolution, but they did benefit from many of the\nchanges that occurred in matters of marriage, divorce, inheritance,\nand the legal status of unwed mothers and their children. However,\nthey ultimately suffered setbacks as many of these reforms were\nwithdrawn or curtailed during Napoleon\u2019s reign. (On the revolutionary\nrecord, see Traer 1980; Landes 1988, 1996; Fraisse 1994; Hunt\n1992; Hufton 1999; Scott 1996; Verjus 2002; Desan 2004; Heuer\n2005; Beckstrand 2009.) A further consequence of the Revolution is\nthat, for the first time, sex was introduced as a constitutional\ncondition for the possession of political rights, even as rights were\nproclaimed to be universal and inalienable. In contrast to such\nhypocrisy, Condorcet affirmed woman\u2019s equal humanity on the grounds of\nreason and justice. While never entirely dismissing the influential\ncase for women\u2019s difference, Condorcet refused to accept this as an\nimpediment to their equal enjoyment of civil and political rights. He\nattributed women\u2019s limitations, to the extent they existed, not to\ntheir sex but rather to their inferior education and circumstances.\nAppreciating the risks he faced in rebutting one of the age\u2019s most\ndeeply held prejudices, he begged for the opportunity to engage in\nreasoned dialogue with his opponents:\n\n\nI hope that anyone who attacks my arguments will do so without using\nridicule or declamation, and above all, that someone will show me a\nnatural difference between men and women on which the exclusion could\nlegitimately be based.

Political Context\n\nGender equality was not the only controversial cause espoused by\nCondorcet: Even before publicly addressing the woman question, he\nargued vociferously for the humanity and rights of enslaved Africans,\nand proposed the abolition of slavery in France\u2019s overseas colonies.\nHis 1781 work R\u00e9flexions sur l\u2019esclavage des\nn\u00e8gres [Reflections on Black Slavery] helped incite the\nabolitionist movement in France, which came together in early 1788 in\nthe newly created Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis des Noirs [Society of\nthe Friends of Blacks], of which Condorcet became president in January\n1789: a counter-lobby to the influential pro-planter Club\n Massiac.[5]\n Condorcet published actively throughout the 1780s and later drafted\nnumerous legislative bills for the National Assembly on the question\nof colonial reform and the slave trade. In addition, he advocated for\nfreedom of commerce, the rights of religious minorities, and criminal\nlaw reform. He considered neither sodomy nor suicide as crimes because\nthey \u201cdo not violate the rights of any other man\u201d, unlike\nrape, which \u201cviolates the property which everyone has in her\nperson\u201d (\u201cNotes on Voltaire [1789]\u201d, in Condorcet\nO\u2019Connor and Arago 1968 [orig. 1847\u20139], vol. IV, 561, 563, 577,\ncited in McLean and Hewitt 1994, 56). He believed in the right of a\nwoman to plan her pregnancies. His views on female education were\nespecially progressive for his time, as he proposed that girls be\neducated alongside boys within universal, co-educational institutions;\nand he would have provided for women\u2019s admission to all professions\nfor which they showed talent.\n\nFeminist, abolitionist, and, in his final years, a democratic\nrepublican, Condorcet acted in public life to expand the claims of\njustice, morality, and human rights. Friend, prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and\nally of Jean Le Rond d\u2019Alembert, disciple of Voltaire, collaborator of\nthe Encyclop\u00e9die, perpetual secretary of the Academy\nof Sciences, member of the French Academy and numerous European\nacademies, renowned mathematician and author of biographies of\nAnne-Robert-Jacques Turgot and Voltaire and many other prominent\nintellectuals of his time, he also participated actively in the world\nof political affairs\u2014first under Turgot\u2019s short ministry\n(1774\u20131776), and then again during the French Revolution. Before\nthe Revolution, he published essays on the application of the theory\nof probability to popular voting, on the American Revolution and the\nConstitutional Convention; and he actively polemicized on behalf of\nTurgot\u2019s attempted reforms of economic and political life. He was\nperhaps the only one of the contributors to Diderot and d\u2019Alembert\u2019s\ncelebrated Encyclop\u00e9die to live long enough to\nparticipate in the French Revolution, helping to draft the 1789\nD\u00e9claration des droits de l\u2019homme et du citoyen\n[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]. Tragically, he\nwas also one of the Revolution\u2019s most prominent casualties:\nParticipant in the preparations for the Convocations of the Estates\nGeneral, elected representative to the Legislative Assembly in 1791\nand later to the National Convention, he wrote a report on public\n instruction[6]\n and drafted a constitution for France embodying his ideal voting\nprocedures, which was never adopted. The year 1793 was a fateful one\nfor Condorcet. He came under an order of proscription by the\nConvention in 1793 following his publicly voiced objections to the\nscrapping of his draft constitution in favor of a hastily prepared\nversion supported by the increasingly dominant Jacobin faction of the\nConvention, his protests over press censorship and the arrests of the\nGirondins, and his scathing comparisons of the Jacobins of 1793 to the\nroyalists of 1791. After eight months in hiding, during which time he\nwrote his unfinished Esquisse [Sketch] (which included the\nsection published first in 1804 as Fragment on the New Atlantis,\nor Combined Efforts of the Human Species for the Advancement of\nScience), he fled Paris but was arrested on March 27, 1794, and\nimprisoned in Bourgla-Reine, where he was found dead in his prison\ncell on March 29\u2014the cause of his death remains unknown. In the\nflorid phrasing of one of his nineteenth-century admirers:\n\n\nOf the illustrious thinkers and writers who for two generations had\nbeen actively scattering the seed of revolution in France, only\nCondorcet survived to behold the first bitter in-gathering of the\nharvest. Those who had sown the wind were no more; he only was left to\nsee the reaping of the whirlwind, and to be swiftly and cruelly swept\naway by it. Voltaire and Diderot, Rousseau and Helv\u00e9tius, had\nvanished, but Condorcet both assisted at the Encyclopaedia and sat in\nthe Convention; the one eminent man of those who had tended the tree,\nwho also came in due season to partake of its fruit; at once a\nprecursor, and a sharer in the fulfillment. (Morley 1871, 37)\n\n2. Life and Ideas\n\nCondorcet was born on 17 September 1743 in the town of\nRibemont-sur-Aisne, in Picardy, to the previously widowed\nMarie-Magdeleine Gaudry and her spouse, the Chevalier Antoine de\nCondorcet, a cavalry captain who was killed on maneuvers only weeks\nafter his son\u2019s birth. The Condorcets were an old noble family from\nthe Dauphin\u00e9. His ancestor Henri de Caritat was among the first\nto adopt the reformed faith in 1561 prior to its official toleration\nin 1598 under the terms of the Edict of Nantes. However, during Louis\nXIV\u2019s campaign against the Huguenots and the Revocation of the Edict\nin 1685, members of the family who did not emigrate were forcibly\nreconverted to the Roman church. By the time of his birth, like other\nmale heirs of this family, Condorcet would have been expected to serve\nthe military or the church. Following his father\u2019s untimely death,\nCondorcet was brought up in isolation by his deeply pious mother, who\ndedicated him for his protection to the virgin, clothing him in white\ndresses until the unconventionally late age of eight. At the\ninstigation of his paternal uncle, the orthodox-leaning bishop of\nLisieux, Condorcet began his formal education at age nine with a\nJesuit instructor; and at age eleven he was enrolled for four years in\nthe Jesuit school at Reims, where he had his first academic success,\nwinning second prize at age thirteen.\n\nDespite his own successes at school, in later years he decried the\nrole played by competition within the coll\u00e8ges of old\nr\u00e9gime France; and he joined other enlightened critics of the\nold order in vehemently opposing the religious control of education.\nIn the first of his 1791 writings on public instruction in the\nBiblioth\u00e8que de l\u2019homme public [The Public Man\u2019s\nLibrary], he emphasized a cooperative model of education, stating:\n\n\nHuman life is not a struggle in which rivals contend for prizes. It is\na voyage that brothers make together: where each employs his forces\nfor the good of all and is rewarded by the sweetness of mutual\nbenevolence, by the pleasure that comes with the sentiment of having\nearned the gratitude or the esteem of others .\u2026 By contrast,\nthe crowns bestowed in our coll\u00e8ges\u2014which induce\nthe schoolboy to believe himself already a great man\u2014only arouse\na childish vanity from which a wise system of instruction would seek\nto preserve us if, by misfortune, its origin lay in our nature and not\nin our blundering institutions. The habit of striving for first place\nis either ridiculous or unfortunate for the individual in whom it has\nbeen inculcated. It is a real calamity for those whom fate condemns to\nlive with him. The need to deserve esteem, on the other hand, leads to\nthat inner peace which alone makes happiness possible and virtue easy.\n(Condorcet, \u201cOn the Nature and Purpose of Public\nInstruction\u201d (1791) in Baker 1976,\n 139\u2013140)[7]\n\n\nThe mix of dogma and corporal punishment that he experienced in his\nJesuit schooling equally appalled Condorcet. In an unpublished\nmanuscript he remarked,\n\n\nThey teach children that they cannot do good acts without grace, and\nthat there are two sorts of sins: the venial, for which you are burnt\nfor a few centuries, and the mortal, for which you are burnt\neternally\u2026. Humiliation and opprobrium are the natural state of\nChristians. (unpublished ms. c. 1778, quoted by Badinter 1988, 19;\ntranslated and cited by McLean and Hewitt 1994, 3)\n\n\nHe advocated for a secular state; considering that since religious\nviews are a matter of one\u2019s conscience of which one is the sole\nlegitimate judge, \u201cit is evident that the expense of maintaining\nsuch worship should be voluntarily borne by those who believe in\nit\u201d (Condorcet, La Vie de Voltaire (1789), translated\nand cited in Rowe 1984, 19). As early as 1774, undoubtedly under the\nsway of his initial meeting with the illustrious Voltaire in 1770, he\naddressed the problem of religious intolerance in an anonymous work\nthat was frequently attributed to Voltaire himself. Despite his\nadmiration for his young acolyte, Voltaire (perhaps mischievously)\ncomplained, \u201cThis is a declaration of a hideous war \u2026 I\nwant neither the glory of having penned it nor the punishment that\nwill follow\u201d (cited in Baker 1976, x). Condorcet, however,\npersisted in his defense of a more secular society. Following 1789, he\npublicly promoted the principle of toleration and opposed the\nintrusion of religion into the new nation\u2019s public\n schools.[8]\n As he stated,\n\n\n\u2026religious opinions cannot form part of the common instruction\nsince they must be the choice of an independent conscience. No\nauthority has the right to prefer one over another. (Condorcet,\n\u201cPublic Instruction\u201d [1791], in Baker 1976, 127)\n\n\nBetween 1758 and 1760, Condorcet continued his studies in ethics,\nmetaphysics, logic and mathematics at the prestigious Coll\u00e8ge\nde Navarre, part of the University of Paris, where the Newtonian\nabb\u00e9 Jean-Antoine Nollet held France\u2019s first chair of\nexperimental physics. Under the tutelage of the abb\u00e9 Georges\nGirault de K\u00e9roudou, regent in philosophy at Navarre,\nCondorcet\u2019s talent for mathematics and philosophy blossomed. After a\ntwo-year stay in Ribemont following Navarre, during which time he\novercame family objections to his pursuit of a scientific career,\nCondorcet took up lodgings in Paris for a time with his former\nteacher, Girault de K\u00e9roudou, undertaking further study in\nproblems of the integral calculus. His first formal paper to the Royal\nAcademy of Science was rejected, although the mathematicians\nAl\u00e9xis-Claude Clairaut and Al\u00e9xis Fontaine recognized\nhis mathematical talent. With better results, he read a second paper\non the same topic before the Academy in 1764. With the endorsement of\nJean Le Rond d\u2019Alembert and \u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout, he published\nEssai sur le calcul integral [Essay on Integral Calculus],\nwhich merited a section in the annual Histoire de\nl\u2019Acad\u00e9mie des sciences for 1765, of which he was not yet\na member. The astronomer Joseph-Jer\u00f4me de Lalande, member of the\nBerlin and French Academies, ranked the then twenty-one year old\nCondorcet as one of the ten leading mathematicians in Europe; and his\nfurther applications of integral calculus impressed such renowned\nmathematicians as Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Leonhard Paul Euler, and\nDaniel Bernoulli. Through d\u2019Alembert, Condorcet was granted an\nintroduction to Voltaire, who would henceforth become another great\ninfluence on the young man; and he began attending the salon of Julie\n(Jeanne Julie \u00c9l\u00e9onore) de Lespinasse, a gathering place\nfor the leading philosophes of the day. There he met and\nbefriended the French economist and statesman Anne-Robert-Jacques\nTurgot (1727\u20131781)\u2014a proponent of physiocratic economic\ntheories and enlightened administration\u2014who, like Voltaire and\nd\u2019Alembert would play an important role in the young mathematician\u2019s\nevolution into an increasingly prominent public intellectual. At\nLespinasse\u2019s salon, he also met and began a close friendship with\nanother woman of letters and hostess of a literary salon, Amelie\nSuard, sister of the publisher Charles-Joseph Panckoucke and wife of\nthe academician Jean-Baptiste Suard. Both Lespinasse and Suard not\nonly encouraged the young man\u2019s intellectual appetites but also appear\nto have counseled him on matters of the heart and his social manners,\nwhich they regarded as rather unpolished (see Badinter 1988). In this\ncompany, he earned a reputation for being a quick-tempered but also\npainfully shy, socially ill at ease, and introverted young man. It was\nLespinasse who called him \u201ca volcano covered in snow\u201d,\nwhile Turgot saw him as \u201cthe rabid sheep\u201d, calm but always\non a short fuse (Williams 2004, 13).\n\nOn the professional front, Condorcet\u2019s success in the science of\nmathematical calculus came early, resulting in his appointment to the\nRoyal Academy of Sciences in 1769. In 1777 he became the permanent\nsecretary of the Academy of Sciences. In 1782, he was appointed to the\nFrench Academy, in recognition of his contribution to the world of\nletters. As a result, as Keith Michael Baker reveals,\n\n\nfor almost twenty years Condorcet was the principal spokesman of\norganized science not only in France but (given the power and prestige\nof the Paris Academy of Science \u2026 [and his post of perpetual\nsecretary]) throughout Europe. Above all, he emerges as the social\ntheorist of science as it developed under the Old Regime to shape some\nof the fundamental postulates of Enlightenment thought. (Baker 1975,\n385)\n\n\nIn the 1770s Condorcet first showed himself to be a talented and\npassionate polemicist, aiming to turn public administration to the\npublic good, while shrewdly appreciating how much power and position\nweighed in achieving the latter. As he wrote in an early letter to\nTurgot, who was then a royal official at Limoges, \u201cTo do good,\none must have as much power as goodwill\u201d (cited in Baker 1976,\nx). Upon Turgot\u2019s ascension to head of the financial administration of\nthe monarchy as Controller-General [in effect, Minister of Finance],\nCondorcet freely offered his services in the war of opinion. He\ndefended Turgot\u2019s introduction of free trade in grain, the abolition\nof guilds and corporations, and the suppression of the\ncorv\u00e9e: the forced labor system or taxation in kind\nassociated with seignurial rights and royal privilege. He pressed for\nreform of the country\u2019s system of weights and measures and\nparticipated in hydrodynamic experiments to determine the engineering\nprinciples of canal construction. Like Turgot\u2019s other short-lived\nreforms, Condorcet also embraced the latter\u2019s unsuccessful proposal to\nreform the system of political representation in France by introducing\na hierarchy of assemblies from the local to the national\n level.[9]\n The minister\u2019s abrupt fall from power in May 1776 left him in deep\ndespair: \u201cthis event has changed the whole of nature for\nme\u201d, he wrote to Voltaire from Ribemont. \u201c I no longer\ntake the same pleasure in this beautiful countryside where he would\nhave brought forth happiness\u2026 How far we are fallen, my dear\nand illustrious master, and from such height\u201d (cited in Baker\n1976, xii).\n\nCondorcet would continue to honor Turgot\u2019s efforts at reform as he\ndeveloped his own ideas about how best to achieve political justice\nthrough the ballot and constitutional revision, as in his essential\nwork Essai sur la constitution et ses functions des\nassembl\u00e9es provinciales [Essay on the Constitution and the\nFunctions of Provincial Assemblies] (1788). In La Vie de\nTurgot [Life of Turgot] (1786), he celebrated his belated\nfriend\u2019s contributions to public administration and free trade.\nMoreover, like his mentor, Condorcet rejected naked self-interest as\nthe only motivator of human behavior, insisting on the role to be\nplayed by love and sympathy. In a correspondence concerning Turgot\u2019s\nrepudiation of the unmodified utilitarianism of Claude Adrien\nHelv\u00e9tius\u2019 De l\u2019Esprit [On Mind] (1759), Condorcet\nadvanced his own thoughts on sympathy and ethics:\n [10]\n\nI have just received your profession of faith: here is mine. When I\nleft college, I fell to reflecting on the moral ideas of justice and\nvirtue. I felt that I saw that the interest we have in being just and\nvirtuous arose from the pain one sensitive being must needs feel on\nbecoming aware of the pain suffered by another. Since then, [and out\nof a fear that other interests would make me evil (m\u00e9chant)] I\nhave tried to preserve this sentiment in all its natural energy. I\ngave up hunting, which I had enjoyed, and would not even kill an\ninsect unless it was very harmful. (Cited in McLean and Hewitt 1994,\n 7)[11]\n\n\nDuring the 1780s and into the early Revolution, Condorcet would devote\nhimself increasingly to \u201cle bien public\u201d [the public\ngood]. For example, he addressed the subject of healthcare, with the\nhope of ending a system long associated with indigence and Christian\ncharity. In his 1786 Memoire sur les h\u00f4pitaux [Memoir\non Hospitals], he suggested closing down the thousand-year old\nmunicipal hospital of the city of Paris, the\nH\u00f4tel-Dieu, and replacing it with a secular,\nlocally-based, municipal health-delivery system composed of small\nneighborhood hospices. He was also not averse to changing his earlier\nformulated positions. In 1793, for example, he reversed his argument\nput forward in 1788 against progressive taxation, in favor of the same\n(see Greenbaum 1984 and Perkins 1984).\n\nMost significant, however, were the evolution of his political views,\nfrom support of a reformed, constitutional monarchy to defense of a\ndemocratic republic, from defense of a property-based franchise to\nuniversal suffrage. He was elected to the Electoral Assembly to\nrepresent the nobility from the bailiwick around his country place at\nMantes. Although he did not serve in the first National Assembly\nfollowing the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, he was elected by\nhis residential district to the General Assembly of the first Paris\nCommune. In October 1791, he was elected to the National Legislative\nAssembly, where he served and then chaired the Committee on Public\nInstruction. In this same year, he looked optimistically toward the\nfuture. Writing under the pseudonym \u201cUn Vieux Bramine\u201d [An\nOld Brahmin] in La Bouche fer, Bulletin du Cercle\nSocial [The Iron Mouth, the Bulletin of the (club) The Social\nCircle], he addressed himself to other friends of liberty,\nproclaiming:\n\n\nI believe humankind is infinitely perfectible, and that it should thus\ndevote itself to achieving peace, liberty and equality, whose term is\nimpossible to fix. I also believe that this progress must be the work\nof reason, fortified by meditation, supported by experience. According\nto these principles, my philosophy has to be cold and patient \u2026\nI would not say, \u201ceverything is good\u201d but rather that\n\u201ceverything will be good\u201d, and, for that, I will offend\nboth sides. [my translation] (cited in Robinet 1968 [orig. 1893],\n 101).[12]\n\n\nHis evolving republican views were confirmed after the King\u2019s flight\nand capture at Varennes in June 1791, and following the attack on July\n17, 1791 on peaceful demonstrators on the Champ-de-Mars (petitioning\nfor a removal of king Louis XVI) by the troops commanded by General\nLafayette (an earlier ally of Condorcet), an event which Condorcet\ntook personally as his wife and infant daughter were among the crowd\non that day. In the fall of 1792, he gained election to the National\nConvention of the newly constituted first French Republic, for which\nhe served by election as one of the nine members of the Committee on a\nConstitution, of which he was then made chairman. In Condorcet\u2019s\nview,\n\n\na republican constitution based upon equality was the only one in\naccordance with nature, reason and justice: the only one that can\nprotect the liberty of citizens and the dignity of the human race.\n(Rosenblum 1984, 188; for the text of the Projet de\nConstitution [Project of the Constitution], see Condorcet\nO\u2019Connor and Arago, vol. 12, 335\u2013415)\n\n\nYet Condorcet\u2019s constitutional plan, which came to be known as\n\u201cLa Girondine\u201d in accordance with the majority of Girondin\ndeputies who served on this committee (although Condorcet was not\none), was never acted upon by the Convention. The Jacobin\nConstitution, accepted by the Convention of June 24, 1793, was never\nimplemented. However, Condorcet\u2019s impassioned attack on the latter and\ndefense of his own views in \u201cAux citoyens fran\u00e7ais, sur\nla nouvelle constitution\u201d [To French Citizens, on the New\nConstitution] led to the order for his arrest on June 8.\n3. Marriage and Intellectual partnership\n\nIn 1786 at age forty-two, Condorcet married the twenty-two year old\nSophie de Grouchy (1764\u20131822), with whom he forged a loving\nrelationship, similar political convictions, and a solid intellectual\npartnership. Like her husband, de Grouchy was committed to bringing\nabout major judicial and political reforms in France; and her own\nexperiences at a convent left her with a similarly fierce dislike of\nthe Church and a commitment to secular values. The two met through\ntheir common interest in the defense of three peasant victims of\njudicial error and legal abuse, the rou\u00e9s de Chaumont,\nwhose cause had been taken up by de Grouchy\u2019s uncle, the magistrate\nCharles Dupaty, president of the parliament of Bordeaux (see Perrod\n1984). In addition to collaborating frequently in Condorcet\u2019s\nwritings, his wife translated the works of Adam Smith and Thomas\nPaine, and she hosted a leading salon at l\u2019Hotel des Monnaies,\nCondorcet\u2019s residence following his appointment in 1775 as\nInspector-General of the Mint. The salon was attended by many foreign\nvisitors\u2014including Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin\u2019s\ngrandson, Thomas Paine, Charles Stanhope, 3rd earl of\nStanhope, and the Marquis de Beccaria (author of the treatise On\nCrimes and Punishments (1764), which opposed torture and the\ndeath penalty)\u2014along with the writer Pierre-Auguste Caron de\nBeaumarchais, the playwright and pamphleteer Olympe de Gouges (author\nof the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female\nCitizen), and the writer and hostess Madame de Sta\u00ebl. During\nthe early years of the Revolution the Condorcet salon was an important\nvenue for followers of the Girondin, and it hosted meetings of the\npreviously mentioned Cercle Social, one of the revolutionary\nclubs most supportive of women\u2019s participation and women\u2019s rights.\nAfter 1789, Condorcet also frequented other salons associated with the\nGirondins such as those of Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud and\nMme (Marie-Jeanne) Roland (Williams 2004, 13).\n\nMme de Condorcet was an accomplished translator and author, in her own\nright; and she shared her husband\u2019s liberal and republican views,\nespecially on matters of criminal justice, political reform, and\nminority and women\u2019s rights. For her attendance at the lyc\u00e9e\nwhere Condorcet taught mathematics and others gave lessons in history\nand the sciences, Mme de Condorcet became known as the\nV\u00e9nus\n Lyc\u00e9enne.[13]\n She learned English expressly in order to read in the original and\ntranslate the seventh edition of Adam Smith\u2019s Theory of Moral\nSentiments, appearing in 1792 in London, despairing like many of\nher contemporaries of the inadequacy of the existing French\n translation.[14]\n In 1791, along with Thomas Paine, the Condorcets founded la\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9publicaine [the Republican\nSociety], sometimes credited as the first republican society in\nFrance; and Mme de Condorcet translated Paine\u2019s writings for the\njournal of the Society, La R\u00e9publicain ou d\u00e9fenseur\ndu gouvernement repr\u00e9sentatif [The Republican or defender\nof representative government]. Separated from one another during his\nperiod of flight, with his wife\u2019s encouragement the philosopher\nundertook the writing of his last works, while she too was composing\nthe text known as Lettres \u00e0 Cabanis sur la sympathie\n[Letters to Cabanis on Sympathy], in which she sets forth her own\nideas on achieving \u201ca society of happiness\u201d. As she wrote\nin her Eighth Letter,\n\n\nwhere is the one who, instead of always looking beyond nature for a\nnew way of enjoying or abusing its blessings, finds each day a new\npleasure in changing all the bonds of duty and servitude around him\ninto relations of charity, good faith and kindness \u2026 (Grouchy\n1994, 183; for scholarly appreciations of Grouchy\u2019s translation of\nAdam Smith, her independent contribution to moral philosophy, and her\nintellectual impact on Condorcet, see Dawson 2004; Brown 2008; Grouchy\n2010)\n\n\nIn one of his last writings, Condorcet addressed a testament to his\ninfant daughter (b. 1790), which shows the enormous respect he held\nfor his wife\u2019s intellect and moral character. \u201cWhen the moment\nof justice has come\u201d, he writes, \u201cshe will find help in my\nwritings. The advice I have written for her, and her mother\u2019s letters\non friendship, will provide a moral education. Other writings by her\nmother give very useful viewpoints on the same subject\u201d\n(\u201cCondorcet\u2019s Testament (March 1794)\u201d, in McLean and\nHewitt 1994, 290). In his advice to his daughter not to stifle her\nfeelings for all other beings, he also echoes his wife\u2019s views on\nsensibility. He is firm on the need not to let resentment overwhelm\nthe soul\u2019s natural disposition to sympathize with others; and, in a\nstriking passage, he cautions the girl that even acts of cruelty\ntoward animals can lead to a brutalization of her originally good\nnature: \u201cThis gentle sensitivity\u201d, he states,\n\n\nwhich can be a source of happiness, originates in the natural feelings\nwhich makes us share the sorrow of all sentient beings. Preserve it in\nall its purity and all its strength. Do not limit it to the suffering\nof men, but extend your humanity even to animals. Do not make any\nwhich belong to you unhappy; do not neglect their welfare; do not be\ninsensitive to their na\u00efve and sincere gratitude; cause them no\nunnecessary pain. Anything of the sort would be a true injustice and\nan insult to nature, who would punish you by the hardness of heart\nwhich habitual cruelty must produce. Lack of foresight in animals is\nthe only excuse for the barbarous law which condemns them to serve as\nfood for one another. Let us remain faithful to nature, and go no\nfurther than this excuse permits. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 287)\n\n\nAt the same time, he counsels his daughter not to exaggerate her\nsensitivity, for that too can be a trap:\n\n\nI shall not give you the useless advice to avoid passion and to beware\nof being too sensitive, but I will tell you to be sincere with\nyourself and not to exaggerate your sensitivity, whether for your\nvanity, to delude your imagination, or to excite that of another.\n(McLean and Hewitt 1994, 287)\n\n\nHe cautions her to \u201censure that the feelings of equality and\njustice become second nature to you\u201d and asks her guardians to\nbring her up\n\n\nto love freedom and equality, and to have republican values and\nvirtues. Ensure that she harbours no feelings of personal\nvengefulness, and that she is taught to protect herself from the\nperils of a sensitive and impulsive nature. Let this be asked of her\nin my name; and let her be told that I was never prey to such things.\n(McLean and Hewitt 1994, 290).\n\n\nPerhaps most remarkable about the couple is how they managed to\nmaintain their optimism at the most perilous moment of their lives\ntogether. In 1793, despite their forced separation and the dangers\nthey faced, she worked on her Letters, he on his\nEsquisse, both works that express unwavering faith in human\nprogress and goodness. As A. Pons (preface, A. de G. Condorcet 1994,\n10) remarks,\n\n\nIt is the moment when he was hunted and obliged to hide himself that\nCondorcet wrote his hymn to progress, which is his Esquisse.\nIt is the moment when she lived with anxiety about her husband, her\ndaughter and herself, and when she was surrounded by the hate of the\nJacobin revolutionaries and the members of her class who reproached\nher for her treason, that Sophie vaunted the sweet effects of\nsympathy! [my translation])\n\n\nIn 1795, after her husband\u2019s death, Mme de Condorcet published the\nEsquisse, and in 1799, his \u00c9loges des\nacademicians [Eulogies for the Academicians]; and she revived her\nsalon at Auteuil at the former home of another salonni\u00e8re,\n(Anne-Catherine de Ligniville) Madame Helv\u00e9tius\n(1722\u20131800). Under the Consulate and the Empire, Mme de\nCondorcet hosted yet another salon, which was a meeting place for\ndissenting republicans. She worked assiduously to defend Condorcet\u2019s\nreputation and to publish his complete works, a version of which\nappeared from 1801 to 1804, with the assistance of her brother-in-law,\nthe French physician and prominent Id\u00e9ologue Pierre Cabanis,\nalong with the revolutionary politician and writer Joseph Garat, and\nthe bibliographer and librarian Antoine Alexandre A.-A. Barbier. The\nproject was continued after her death, resulting in a second collected\nedition in 1847\u20131849, undertaken by her daughter Eliza (Louise\nAlexandrine de Condorcet, b.1790) and son-in-law, the exiled Irish\nrevolutionary Arthur O\u2019Connor, with the assistance of Fran\u00e7ois\nArago, Condoret\u2019s successor as Secretary of the Academy of Sciences\n(Institute de France). (The first volume of the second edition of the\nOeuvres completes included a sympathetic biography of the\nphilosopher by Arago. A. Condorcet O\u2019Connor and F. Arago 1968 [orig.\n1847\u20139]. For other classic French works on Condorcet, see: Vial\n1970 [orig. 1902]; Cahen 1904; Alengry 1971 [orig. 1904]; Koyr\u00e9\n1948; and the influential intellectual biography by E. and R.\nBadinter, 1988).\n\nCondorcet\u2019s partnership with this exceptional woman doubtless\nconfirmed him in his generous views about women\u2019s abilities,\nstrengthened his commitment to women\u2019s independence and liberty; and,\nmost assuredly, spurred him on to address concretely the need to\nrectify the injustices to which all women were subjected in an age of\npurportedly greater enlightenment.\n4. The Rights of Women\n\nCondorcet\u2019s most extensive arguments on women\u2019s rights appear in two\nessays. The first was authored in 1787, prior to the Revolution; the\nsecond, published in 1790 in the Journal of the Society of\n1789, was composed in the context of a debate over the\nappropriate constitutional arrangements for the new French nation. In\naddition, commitment to women\u2019s rights informs his Testament\nto his daughter, and is not forgotten in the section of the\nEsquisse known as the Fragment sur l\u2019Atlantide\n[Fragment on the New Atlantis], where he restates his objection to\nusing allegations about physical or intellectual inferiority to\njustify political exclusion (see Fricheau, 1989). In his 1791\nMemoirs on Public Instruction, he demands that public\neducation be open to women and men, and that women not be excluded\nfrom any curriculum, including science (see Condorcet 1791 web\nresource; Kintzler 1984; and Didier 1989 on the strong links between\nCondorcet\u2019s views on education and on women\u2019s equality and\nrights). Whereas the eighteenth century has been famously\ncharacterized as \u201cthe age of woman\u201d\u2014owing, in large\nmeasure, to its depiction during the nineteenth century by the\nGoncourt\n brothers[15]\u2014for\n the most part, neither the philosophes nor their most\nintellectually distinguished female contemporaries (in France, Madame\nde Lambert, Madame du Ch\u00e2telet, Madame de Graffigny, Madame\nRiccoboni, Madame de Lambert, Julie de Lespinasse, and Madame de\nGenlis; in Italy, the University of Bologna professor of mathematics,\nFran\u00e7oise Agnesi and professor of anatomy Laura Bassi)\naddressed the question of women\u2019s rights with the same clarity,\ndirectness or force as Condorcet. Moreover, enlightened claims about\nnatural human equality were tempered by entrenched assumptions about\ncomplementary male and female sex-specific attributes, which provided\nammunition for the delayed expansion of women\u2019 civil and political\nrights in modern times. As Steinbr\u00fcgge (1995, 4) proposes, the\neighteenth-century \u201cis the age that saw the emergence of an\nimage of female nature that allowed precisely these exclusions to be\nconsidered \u2018natural\u2019\u201d. Thus, the defenders of\nwomen\u2019s rights during the \u201cAge of Enlightenment\u201d were\nfaced with the problem that the denial of women\u2019s equality was couched\nin secular not religious considerations and buttressed by\npseudo-scientific claims.\n\nYet Condorcet never abandoned science in his support for women\u2019s\nrights; nor did he see scientific claims as a barrier to greater\nequality (Ansart [2009] further proposes a connection between his\nfeminism and his pioneering effort to apply mathematics to social\ninvestigation). Moreover, he anchored his defense in a counter-strain\nwithin enlightened thought that dates back to the early 1670s when the\nex-theologian and disciple of Descartes Poulain de la Barre challenged\nmale supremacy and advocated gender and racial equality (see Poulain\nde la Barre 2002; Stuurman 2004). As against the philosophical\nanthropology that held sway with so many philosophes, Poulain\nand other contributors to what is known as the \u201cquerelle des\nfemmes\u201d offered a rationalist alternative to standard\nmisogynistic positions, which pointed not to the body but the\n mind.[16]\n It is to this rationalist tradition that Condorcet is indebted.\nHowever, Condorcet\u2019s consideration of women\u2019s rights is especially\nnoteworthy given the paucity of discussion of women\u2019s rights within\nenlightened circles as well as the absence of any organized campaign\nfor women\u2019s rights in France (or elsewhere) in the years immediately\nleading up to 1789. As the philosopher was well aware, there also\nexisted what he referred to as the comfortable habits of mind by which\nwomen were regarded as second-class citizens. Moreover, Condorcet not\nonly expanded upon Poulain\u2019s earlier contribution but his 1787 and\n1790 arguments boldly anticipated and reinforced the position taken by\nthose relatively few who dared to demand rights for women during the\nRevolution and with increasing numbers, and ultimately more\nsuccessfully, made the same demands in the following centuries (On\nenlightened male thinkers who discussed women\u2019s condition, see Brookes\n1980; Landes 1988; Pappas 1991; Nall 2008 and 2010. \n4.1 Women\u2019s Rights within Republican Constitutions\n\nThe Second Letter of Lettres d\u2019un bourgeois de Newhaven \u00e0\nun citoyen de Virginie [Letters from a Freeman of New Haven to a\nCitizen of Virginia on the Futility of Dividing the Legislative Power\namong Several Bodies] (1787) defends the justice of a single\nlegislative body, against the American preference for a bicameral\nlegislature (McLean and Hewitt 1994,\n 292\u2013334).[17]\n Here Condorcet addresses the scope and limits of a \u201cpeaceful,\nfree and lasting constitution\u201d, in light of the principle of\nnatural rights, which he proceeds to define:\n\n\nThese rights are called natural because they derive from the\nnature of man; because it is a clear and necessary consequence of the\nvery fact that a sentient being capable of reason and moral ideas\nexists that he must enjoy these rights and could not justly be\ndeprived of them. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 297)\n\n\nFrom natural rights, inherent in each person as a morally conscious\nbeing, Condorcet derives civil rights, including \u201cthe right to\nvote on matters of common interest, either in person or through freely\nelected representatives\u201d, as well as the true meaning of a\nrepublican form of government, in which the interests of its citizens\ncorrespond with the general interest. Therefore, he argues, a\n\n\nstate in which some of the inhabitants, or at least some of the\nlandowners, are deprived of these rights ceases to be free \u2026 It\nis no longer a true republic [and] having said this, it is also true\nto say that no true republic has ever existed.\n\n\nHowever, having defined the conditions of republican constitution,\nCondorcet goes further to discuss sexual discrimination, observing\nthat if government is to be consistent with the principles of reason\nand justice, then there are no grounds for denying equal rights for\nwomen:\n\n\nIf we agree that men have rights simply by virtue of being capable of\nreason and moral ideas, then women should have precisely the same\nrights. Yet never in any so-called free constitution have women had\nthe right of citizenship. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 297)\n\n\nFurthermore, he states, if\n\n\nthe right of citizenship requires that a person can act according to\nhis own free will [then, in his opinion] any civil law which\nestablishes sufficient inequality between men and women for the latter\nto be supposed incapable of free will would simply increase the\ninjustice. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 297\u201398)\n\n\nOn the basis of natural rights, Condorcet moves immediately to tackle\nthe question of political representation, as it concerns all women as\nwell as the particular circumstances of married women. Alluding to the\nEnglish principle of no taxation without representation, as\npopularized in France in Jean-Louis Delolme\u2019s 1771 Constitution\nd\u2019Angleterre [Constitution of England], Condorcet insists that\n\u201call women have the right to refuse to pay taxes levied by\nparliaments\u201d; adding that he has found no \u201csubstantial\narguments against these points, at least as far as widows and\nunmarried women are concerned\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 297).\nHowever, while unmarried women and widows might be admitted to\npolitical rights, the much thornier problem of married women\u2019s rights\nremains to be tackled. Condorcet confronts the question head-on,\nknowing that even English law, to which he has just appealed, is\nstrongly prejudiced against married women. Under English common law,\nan unmarried adult was considered to have the legal status of a\nfeme sole (in law book French), while a married woman had the\nstatus of a feme covert. Colloquially speaking, husband and\nwife were one person as far as the law was concerned, and that person\nwas the husband. Women were restricted from owning property, signing\nlegal documents, entering into contracts, obtaining an education, or\nkeeping her own salary, without her husband\u2019s permission. In\npre-revolutionary France, as the historian Dominique Godineau (1998,\nxix) points out, women were likewise conceptualized according to their\nroles as mothers and spouses, thereby \u201cplaced outside of the\npublic and hence outside of the city\u201d. The same was true of\ntheir position in the Encyclop\u00e9die, she observes,\nwhere Diderot considers that the (masculine) word\ncitoyen\u2014 that is, one who possesses political\nrights\u2014is only attributable \u201cto women, young children, or\nto servants as one would [refer] to the members of a family of a\ncitizen in the strict sense of the word; they aren\u2019t really\ncitizens\u201d. Thus, in pre-revolutionary France political\nindividuals represented families (including family servants, where\napplicable), not merely themselves. In short, if rights inhered in\nindependent persons, then according to tradition and legal reasoning,\na woman was not strictly speaking a legal personality. A woman\u2019s legal\nrights were merged with those of her husband (and prior to marriage,\nwith her father). A married woman counted for nothing before the law;\nand therefore could not count as a citizen whose natural rights had to\nbe respected by the state.\n\nWith respect to the issue of who is authorized to represent the\nfamily, and the practice whereby only men are granted this\nprerogative, Condorcet makes a simple observation: If marriage is\n\u201ca society of two people\u201d, it admits of only one condition\nunder which a necessary inequality be allowed, that is, \u201cthe\nneed for someone to have a casting vote on the rare occasions when the\ndifferent opinions cannot be allowed to act simultaneously, while at\nthe same time the need to act quickly means that we cannot wait for\nthe parties to come to an agreement\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994,\n298). However, even in these circumstances, Condorcet insists that\nthere need be no permanent inequality introduced between the spouses.\nHe would instead divide and rotate the prerogative, giving\n\u201ceither men or women the casting vote for matters in which one\nor the other is more likely to express a will which conforms to\nreason\u201d. He also reminds his readers that greater equality\nbetween spouses is \u201cnot as new as we might imagine\u201d, for\nRoman women were granted by Emperor Julian the right to initiate\ndivorce proceedings against their spouses. On this point, Condorcet\ncannot resist a witticism: \u201cPerhaps the least gallant of the\nCaesars was the most just toward women\u201d, he proposes (McLean and\nHewitt 1994, 298).\n\nThe principle of justice requires that \u201cwe stop debarring women\nfrom the right of citizenship\u201d. What then of women\u2019s eligibility\nfor public functions? In this section of the Second Letter, Condorcet\nconsiders the grounds for excluding women as voters and as public\nfunctionaries, and prepares the argument that will reappear in his\n1790 essay. He refers first to the principle of utility: \u201cLegal\nexclusions should therefore be made only when reason clearly proves\ntheir utility\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 298). A \u201cgood\nelection method\u201d would allow, he maintains, for the elimination\nof persons tried and found guilty of certain crimes, as well as two\ncategories of dependent persons, those in domestic service and those\nbelow the mandated age of civil majority. Except in one important\nrespect, his criteria for the exclusion of these categories of person\nare consistent with eighteenth-century republican assumptions, which\nultimately guided the drafters of the 1791 Constitution, who divided\nthe population into active and passive citizenship. Only the\nformer\u2014approximately 15% of the French population and 61% of men\n(approximately 4, 298,360)\u2014possessed the full rights of\ncitizenship. They had to be males 25 years or older, who had occupied\nthe same residence for at least one year, and had paid the equivalent\nof 3 days of salary. By the terms of France\u2019s first post-1789\nConstitution, all women were assigned the status of passive citizens;\nand French women did not achieve full citizenship until 1944. In\ncontrast, even before the French Revolution Condorcet had opposed the\npassage of laws expressly excluding women, even from posts in the\nmilitary or magistracy. Instead of legal prohibitions he looks to\ncivil law and education to support women\u2019s participation. He\nunderscores the role to be played by education in countering the\nlimitations attributed to woman\u2019s physical and intellectual\nlimitations, maintaining:\n\n\nthe female constitution means that they would make unsuitable soldiers\nand, for some of their lives, debars them from posts which require\nhard work on a daily basis. Pregnancy, childbirth and breast-feeding\nwould prevent them from fulfilling these functions. But I believe all\nother differences between men and women are simply the result of\neducation. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 299)\n\n\nEducation not nature is deemed to be the cause of women\u2019s inferiority\nand her presumed unsuitability for given social roles and tasks. Only\nin certain limited circumstances, or at certain periods of time, are\nphysical limitations a factor. Condorcet believes that women are not\nintellectually inferior to men; rather, they are victims of an\ninferior education. \u201cEven if we agree that women might still not\nhave the same mental or physical power as men, this would mean simply\nthat the best women were equal to the second-best men, better than the\nthird best, and so on\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 299).\nComplementing Voltaire for what he takes to be the\nphilosophe\u2019s generally enlightened views toward women,\nCondorcet nonetheless disputes the latter\u2019s reservations about women\u2019s\ngenius and inventiveness. For one thing, he insists, \u201cif posts\ncould be filled only by men capable of invention, many would remain\nvacant, even in academies. On the contrary, for a great many posts, it\nis not even in the interests of the public that the time of a man of\ngenius be sacrificed\u201d. Appealing further to the genius of two\nwomen of letters, Mme de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 and Mme de la Fayette,\nhe only concedes that women might not equal men in the very highest\ndomains of science and philosophy\u2014an odd admission since\nCondorcet might well have raised in this regard the example of\nVoltaire\u2019s own lover, the brilliant Newtonian Mme de Chatelet.\n\nThere are two other references to women in the Second Letter. In a\ndiscussion of what could be termed military and foreign affairs,\nCondorcet compares the unjust treatment of women to the position of\nsubject populations within republics: in such circumstances,\n\u201cthey cannot speak of freedom as a right\u201d (McLean and\nHewitt 1994, 312). In another passage, Condorcet sums up and defends\nhimself against the charge of triviality concerning the arguments he\nhas made on behalf of women\u2019s rights: \u201cThis examination may seem\nvery long\u201d, he writes, \u201cbut we are discussing the rights\nof half of the human race which have been neglected by all\nlegislators. Besides, it cannot harm men\u2019s freedom to show how to\novercome the only possible objection against republics, and to mark\nout a real difference between them and States which are not\nfree\u201d. But tellingly, men are not the only audience Condorcet\nfears may deride his arguments: he worries about women\u2019s reactions,\nsince they have been led astray by none other than Jean-Jacques\nRousseau\u2019s enticements to remain in the domestic sphere (McLean and\nHewitt 1994, 299).\n\nEven a philosopher finds it hard not to get a little carried away when\ndiscussing women. However, I fear that I shall fall foul of them if\never they read this article. I have discussed their right to equality\nand not their influence, and so might be suspected of secretly wishing\nto decrease this influence. And since Rousseau gained their support by\nsaying that they were made simply to look after us and were fit only\nto torment us, I should not expect their support. But truth is a good\nthing, even if I lay myself open to ridicule by speaking it. (McLean\nand Hewitt 1994, 299)\n\n4.2 A Bold Defense of Women\u2019s Rights\n\nIn contrast to his 1787 work, in which women\u2019s rights are part of a\nlarger consideration of the elements of a just constitution,\nCondorcet\u2019s 1790 essay Sur l\u2019admission des femmes au droits de la\ncit\u00e9 [On the Admission of Women to the Rights of\nCitizenship] stands as one of the most concise and potent defenses of\nwomen\u2019s rights in the entire history of feminist thought. It also\nneeds to be set within the context of the monumental events that began\nin 1789 and led up to the adoption by the newly elected national\nassembly of the Constitution of 1791. By the terms of the 1791\nConstitution of the new constitutional monarchy, as already briefly\nobserved, the population was divided between active and passive\ncitizens on the basis on the basis of wealth, thereby excluding the\nlarge majority of male citizens from full political participation.\nComplicated suffrage provisions restricted popular influence further.\nHowever, the new laws also categorized all women (without exception)\nas passive citizens, a departure from old r\u00e9gime legal practice\nwhereby women could sometimes vote and act as regents. In addition to\nbarring women from the voting process or from serving as magistrates\nor elected representatives, only men were granted the privilege of\nserving in the newly formed militias, an increasingly important\nfunction of republican citizenship during these same years. Gender\ndivisions would, if anything, become even more pronounced after 1792\nwhen the monarchy was abolished and France became a republic, the\ndivisions between active and passive male citizenship were removed,\nand universal male suffrage established but nothing was done to alter\nwomen\u2019s secondary political status before the law. Yet from the outset\nof the Revolution in 1789, in practice women were far from being\nwholly \u201cpassive\u201d. Many militated for rights and\nparticipated actively in the clubs and societies of the revolutionary\npublic sphere.\n\nCondorcet was not alone in recognizing the manifest contradiction\nbetween the principles of natural rights and reason, on the one hand,\nand the exclusion of women from full political rights, on the other.\nNor was he the only one to link the question of female citizenship to\nthe demand for rights by other groups like Jews, Protestants, and\nmulattos, whose political and civil rights had been curtailed under\nthe old r\u00e9gime, or even to the radical demand for slave\nemancipation. Some politically active women protested for improvements\nin women\u2019s condition, and even demanded woman\u2019s right to bear arms.\nThe Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des amis de la\nv\u00e9rit\u00e9 [Confederation of the Friends of Truth] was\nthe first club to admit women as regular members and the first to\nestablish a separate women\u2019s section. The club campaigned in support\nof divorce, and engaged in a heated debate over member Etta Palm\nd\u2019Aelder\u2019s speech calling on men to devote their full attention to the\nproblem of women\u2019s rights, insisting \u201cwe are your companions not\nyour slaves\u201d (Etta Palm d\u2019Aelders, Appel aux\nfran\u00e7oises sur la r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration des moeurs\net la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l\u2019influence des femmes dans un\ngourvernement libre [Appeal to the French concerning the\nRegeneration of Morals and the Necessity for Women\u2019s Influence in a\nFree Government], cited in Kates 1985, 123\u20134). Among the other\nissues taken up by Palm and her confederates in the women\u2019s section\nwere elimination of primogeniture, protection against wife beating, a\ncomprehensive divorce bill, and political equality for women. Palm\nconceived of a Parisian and nationwide system of affiliated clubs to\ncare for and educate children and clinics for indigent women. As early\nas October 1789, the playwright Olympe de Gouges proposed a reform\nprogram to the National Assembly that encompassed legal sexual\nequality, admission for women to all occupations, and the suppression\nof the dowry system through a state-provided alternative. In her 1791\nD\u00e9claration des droits de la femme et de la citoyenne\n[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and Female Citizen], Gouges\nrejoices in the natural equality of all human beings and decries the\nhypocrisy of denying people on the basis of race and sex the inherent\nrights to which they are owed. Although always a minority position,\nstill other voices were raised inside and outside France on behalf of\nfull equality, perhaps most famously Mary Wollstonecraft in her\nequally eloquent 1792 treatise The Vindication of the Rights of\nWoman.\n\nCondorcet opens his 1790 essay with a powerful indictment of his\n\u201cmost enlightened\u201d compatriots, above all those\nphilosophers and legislators who speak and legislate on behalf of the\nprinciple of human rights, yet deny those rights to one-half of the\nhuman race:\n\nHabit can so familiarize men with violations of their natural rights\nthat those who have lost them neither think of protesting nor believe\nthey are unjustly treated. Some of these violations even escaped the\nnotice of the philosophers and legislators who enthusiastically\nestablished the rights common to all members of the human race, and\nmade these the sole basis of political institutions. Surely they were\nall violating the principle of equal rights by debarring women from\ncitizenship rights, and thereby calmly depriving half of the human\nrace of the right to participate in the formation of the laws. Could\nthere be any stronger evidence of the power of habit over enlightened\nmen, than the picture of them invoking the principle of equal rights\nfor three or four hundred men who had been deprived of equal rights by\nan absurd prejudice, and yet forgetting it with regard to 12 million\nwomen. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 335)\n\n\nCondorcet argues that without the inclusion of women, the nation would\nhave no recourse to a \u201cfree constitution\u201d. Recognizing the\nshift that has occurred in France in grounding rights in individual\nproperty, he calls attention to the fact that \u201cthe elective\nassemblies of our bailiwicks gave to feudal rights that which they\nrefused to natural rights. It is to women that several of our noble\ndeputies owe the fact that they sit amongst the national\nrepresentatives\u201d. Indeed he advises that rather than depriving\nfemale feudal property owners of their former rights, would it not be\nbetter to extend to all female property owners and heads of households\nthe same rights that men have now achieved? \u201cWhy, if we consider\nit absurd to exercise citizenship rights by proxy, should we deprive\nwomen of this right, instead of giving them the freedom to exercise it\nin person?\u201d The irony, he recalls, is that before 1776 \u201ca\nwoman could rule France [as a regent?] and yet, before 1776 (when\nTurgot\u2019s abolition of the guilds were introduced), she could not\nbecome a dressmaker in Paris [without her husband\u2019s assistance]\u201d\n(McLean and Hewitt 1994, 339). Truly throwing down the gauntlet, he\ninsists that unless it can be proven that \u201cthe natural rights of\nwomen are not exactly the same as those of men\u201d, then the new\nnation is guilty of constituting itself on an \u201cact of\ntyranny\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 337, 335).\n\nFollowing this pointed accusation, he proceeds to argue for women\u2019s\nrights in the manner already put forward in his 1787 discussion,\nalthough here he explicitly joins women\u2019s rights to the rights of\nreligious and racial minorities\u2014no doubt hoping that men of\nreason will join his cause, even if slave owners and Catholic\nextremists are likely to oppose it:\n\nThe rights of men stem exclusively from the fact that they are\nsentient beings, capable of acquiring moral ideas and of reasoning\nupon them. Since women have the same qualities, they necessarily also\nhave the same rights. Either no member of the human race has any true\nrights, or else they all have the same ones; and anyone who votes\nagainst the rights of another, whatever his religion, colour or sex,\nautomatically forfeits his own. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 335)\n\n\nOnce again, however, Condorcet is forced to consider strongly held\nviews about the social implications of women\u2019s bodies. He argues that\nneither women\u2019s duties nor their bodies ought to disqualify them from\nparticipating in the public sphere. He begins with the trivial and\nmoves to more serious objections, first comparing the inconveniences\nof motherhood to such \u201cmonthly indispositions\u201d as gout and\nthe common cold. On a more serious note, he observes, \u201cpeople\nargue that, differences in education apart, men are still naturally\nmore intelligent than women, but this is far from being proven, and\nwould have to be before women could justly be deprived of a natural\nright\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 335). Again he reprises his\nformer arguments regarding women\u2019s genius and the inappropriate link\nbetween genius and the legitimate exercise of rights: Even if the\ncharge of women\u2019s lack of demonstrated genius were true, which he\ndoubts, \u201cwe would hardly attempt to limit citizenship rights\nonly to men of genius\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 335). Granting\nthe existence of a small fraction of men possessing true genius, he\nstates, \u201cthis small class apart, both sexes have an equal share\nof inferior and superior minds\u201d, thus there is no more reason to\nexclude women from the exercise of rights than there would be to\nexclude the vast majority of men. He mobilizes the examples of Queen\nElizabeth of England, Marie Theresa of Austria, and the two Catherines\nof Russia as ample proof that \u201cwomen lack neither strength of\nmind nor the courage of their convictions\u201d. And in a playful\nparagraph he deliciously debunks the great evils done by a host of\nsupposedly great men, asking whether such women as Catherine Macaulay,\nMarie le Jars de Gournay, Marie-Anne de la Tremoille, princess of\nUrsins, Mme du Ch\u00e2telet, or Mme de Lambert would have undermined\nfreedom of conscience or the rights of citizens, attacked a free\nconstitution, or passed such \u201cabsurd and barbarous laws \u2026\n[as those] against protestants, thieving servants, smugglers and\nnegroes?\u201d In sum, he observes, \u201cMen have no real reason to\nbe so proud when they cast their eyes over the list of those who have\ngoverned them\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 336).\n\nCondorcet rejects the claim that \u201cwomen have never based their conduct\non what is called reason,\u201d insisting that \u201cthey may never have behaved\naccording to the reason of men; but they do behave according to their\nown reason\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 336). While allowing for the\npossibility that women may have their own reason, a different reason\nfrom that of men, still Condorcet meets his compatriot\u2019s strong\nobjections that women reason differently or perhaps do not reason at\nall by advocating raised educational standards, improved laws, and the\nequalization of the social circumstances endured by the sexes. Only\nwith these reforms, he insists, will women come to escape the pull of\nvanity and self-interest, to which they are doomed in the present, and\ncome to respond to the demands of justice and positive law. As for\nwhatever residual differences between the sexes might still remain,\nCondorcet finds in them a comprehensible logic:\n\n\nThe fact that they [women] base their conduct on different principles\nand set themselves different aims does not mean that they are\nirrational. It is as reasonable for a woman to concern herself with\nher facial charms as it was for Demosthenes to cultivate his voice and\ngestures. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 336\u20137)\n\n\nWhether it is a question of admirable or contemptible qualities,\nCondorcet does not blame women\u2019s nature but rather points to their\nupbringing, to which he attributes their ignorance and superstition.\nBecause women are blocked from exercising real power, they resort to\nusing illicit influence. If it is true that women are less egoistic\nand hardhearted, more gentle and sensitive than men, he credits this\nto their socialization as well as to their overly protected lives:\n\n\nThey have no experience of business, or of any matter which is decided\nby positive laws or rigorous principles of justice; the areas which\nconcern them and where they are active are precisely those which are\ngoverned by feelings and natural decency. It is quite unfair to\njustify continuing to refuse women the enjoyment of their natural\nrights on grounds which are plausible only precisely because they do\nnot enjoy those rights. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 337)\n\n\nIn an insightful observation concerning the patriarchal arrangements\nof his day, Condorcet asserts: If it is true that women are unduly\ninfluenced by their husbands, on whom they are dependent, this cannot\nbe grounds for their exclusion \u201cbecause we could destroy this\ntyrannical civil law \u2026 [and] One injustice must never become a\nreason to commit another\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 337).\n\nCondorcet looks to education and publicity to eliminate the secret\nsway that royal mistresses and some other old r\u00e9gime women had\nexercised. He argues that whatever influence women have, it is far\nmore of \u201ca threat if it acts in secret than if it acts in a\npublic debate\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 337). By becoming\npublic, the undue influence of one person over another would\nnecessarily lose its sway. At the same time, he counsels that the same\narguments used to deprive women of their rights could easily be used\nagainst laborers\u2014\u201canyone who was obliged to work\nconstantly and could therefore neither become enlightened nor exercise\nhis reason. Before long, citizenship would be open only to men who had\ncompleted a course of public law \u2026\u201d Adopting what was\nfast-becoming the most damning slogan of republicans during the\nRevolution, he charges that \u201call aristocracies were\nformed or justified by this kind of pretext [my emphasis]\u201d\n(McLean and Hewitt 1994, 337). Certainly, he was not alone in leveling\nthe charge of aristocracy in relation to gender equality. For example,\nas early as 1789, a radical tract appeared, entitled Requ\u00eate\ndes Dames \u00e0 l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e Nationale [The Ladies\u2019\nRequest to the National Assembly], which protested the\n\u201cmasculine aristocracy\u201d being established by the Assembly,\nand proposed it be decreed that \u201call the privileges of the male\nsex are entirely and irrevocably abolished throughout France; [and\nthat] the feminine sex will always enjoy the same liberty, advantages,\nrights, and honors as does the masculine sex\u201d (A. Soboul, 1982;\ncited and translated in K. Offen 2000, 54\u201355). Similarly, Olympe\nde Gouges exclaimed:\n\n\nMan, are you capable of being just? It is a woman who poses the\nquestion; you will not deprive her of that right at least. Tell me,\nwhat gives you sovereign empire to oppress my sex? \u2026. Man alone\nhas raised his exceptional circumstances to a principle. Bizarre,\nblind, bloated with science and degenerated\u2014in a century of\nenlightenment and wisdom\u2014into the crassest ignorance, he wants\nto command as a despot a sex which is in full possession of its\nintellectual faculties; he pretends to enjoy the Revolution and to\nclaim his rights to equality in order to say nothing more about it.\n(Gouges 1791).\n\n\nFinally, then, Condorcet arrives at the most intransigent of\nobjections to women\u2019s freedom, those based on utility. What if by\ngaining rights women would be tempted to abandon their domestic\naffairs? What if female citizens would move beyond a relatively\npassive exercise of rights to assume the reigns of government?\nCondorcet insists that appeals to utility have been abused, serving\noften as mere pretexts of tyrants for denying \u201ca true\nright\u201d and resulting in such crimes as the enslavement of\nAfricans, the imprisonment of innocents at the Bastille, the\ncensorship of the press, and the exploitation of workers in trade and\nindustry. However, he also finds it necessary to go beyond merely\nanswering utilitarian objections to women\u2019s equality by assuaging\nmen\u2019s fears. As a result, and even if for only tactical reasons, he\nends up making a decisive concession to his opponents. So, he\nreassures men,\n\nthere is no need to fear that, just because women would be members of\nthe National Assembly, they would immediately abandon their children,\ntheir homes and their needlework. In fact, this would only make them\nbetter able to raise their children and to make men of them. It is\nnatural for a woman to nurse her children and for her to look after\nthem when they are young. Forced by this to stay at home and weaker\nthan men, it is also natural that she lead a more secluded, more\ndomestic life. Women therefore fall into the same category as men who\nneed to work for several hours a day. This may be a reason not to\nelect them, but it cannot form the basis of a legal exclusion.\nChivalry may lose out by this change, but domestic life would gain\nfrom this equality, as from all others. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 338)\n\n4.3 Appraising Condorcet\u2019s Stance\n\nThere is no question that Condorcet advanced some of the age\u2019s most\ncompelling claims on behalf of women, which were in turn part of his\ndeep-seated commitment to individual liberty and social equality. In\nclosing his brief for female citizenship, he challenges his critics to\n\u201cshow me a natural difference between men and women on which the\nexclusion could legitimately be based\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994,\n339). Yet even this advocate of reason and sexual equality introduces\nan asymmetry between the sexes, and he locates that disproportion\ndirectly on the reproductive and maternal body of woman. Despite his\nobjection to the argument of natural difference, Condorcet allows that\nsexual differences would still continue to have social effects within\na more rationally organized society. However, he indicates his\nawareness of the persuasive attacks by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other\nlike-minded reformers on the very widely practiced custom of\nwet-nursing the infants and toddlers of the better classes, as well as\nthe same reformers\u2019 complaints against the vanity and egotism of women\nwho employed wet-nurses (see Landes 1988, chapter 3). Therefore, it is\nvery likely that Condorcet\u2019s reassurances are meant not just for men\nbut also for women. At this point in time public opinion was clearly\nturning against any woman who would willingly choose to neglect her\ndomestic duties or altogether disavow them, especially should she do\nso for either social or strictly selfish reasons. Although Rousseau\nand others did insist on fathers taking a greater involvement and\nresponsibility towards their families, none of this was meant to\nrelieve a woman of her primary domestic role or its attendant burdens.\nIf anything, reformers insisted on both parents simply doing more in\nfamily life while preserving the sexual division of labor.\n\nIn his defense, however, it is clear that until the tragic end of his\nlife, Condorcet never relinquished the notion that a woman not only\ncan but also must prepare vocationally for her own independence. In\nhis Testament he advises his infant daughter to \u201cget\ninto the habit of working so that you are self-sufficient and need no\nexternal help \u2026 though you may become poor, you will never\nbecome dependent on others\u201d. And such work should not be routine\nor menial: \u201cchoose a type of work which does not occupy the\nhands alone, but engages the mind without straining; something which\ncompensates your efforts by the pleasure it gives you\u201d (McLean\nand Hewitt 1994, 284). Coming from the titled aristocracy, for whom\nthe idea of a woman\u2019s paid employment might have seemed inappropriate,\nif not bizarre, this is remarkable advice. But Condorcet insists that\nhis daughter be prepared for all circumstances. In the sad prospect of\nthe compounding loss of her mother as well as her father, he asks her\nguardians to prepare his daughter for a great deal more than\n\u201cthe usual ladylike accomplishments\u201d, advising: \u201cI\nshould like my daughter to learn to draw, to paint and to engrave well\nenough to be able to earn a living without too much difficulty or\nrepugnance. I should like her to learn to read and to speak\nEnglish\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 290). Likewise, in the tenth\nstage of the progress for the human mind in his Esquisse, he\nboldly affirms that\n\n\namong the causes of the progress of the human mind of the human mind\nthat are of the utmost importance to the general happiness, we must\nnumber the complete annihilation of the prejudices that have brought\nabout an inequality of rights between the sexes, an inequality fatal\neven to the party in whose favour it works. (Condorcet 1955 [orig.\n1795], 193)\n\n\nIn sum, just as tyranny in the political order disfigures the tyrants\nas much as their victims, Condorcet believes that men will be\ninfinitely better off once they accept the full equality of women.\n\nIndeed, a great deal of the ambivalence that one detects in\nCondorcet\u2019s 1790 essay belongs to the times, not merely in the sense\nof the day\u2019s prejudices\u2014which, as we have seen, he strongly\ncombated\u2014but rather also with respect to the extent to which the\nopportunity for achieving women\u2019s rights was eclipsed by an\nincreasingly negative, even openly hostile climate toward women who\nwere perceived to be overly \u201cpublic\u201d and insufficiently\nmodest and \u201cdomestic\u201d. In the face of women\u2019s heightened\npolitical involvement during the popular revolution, those few\nrepresentatives still favoring political equality for women appear to\nhave retracted their former support. Despite his pronounced early and\nvisible commitment to women\u2019s voting rights, Condorcet\u2019s public\nsilence on the issue when presenting his introductory report on the\ndraft constitution to the Convention in 1793 still remains perplexing.\nThe constitutional debate occurred after the removal of the\ndistinction between passive and active voters, so that the denial of\nwomen\u2019s rights was made more explicitly than ever a matter of sexual\ndifference rather than one of property or class position. In addition,\nfrom the declaration of the Republic in September 1792 until women\u2019s\npolitical participation was proscribed by the deputies of the\nConvention in the fall of 1793, popular women\u2019s activism in the\nstreets and in the galleries of the Convention was accelerating, but\nso too was a campaign against women in the revolutionary press. (On\nthis period, see especially Levy, et al. 1979 and Godineau 1998).\n\nAlthough Condorcet remained silent, others among his friends and\npolitical allies spoke up. The Welsh-born naturalized French citizen\nDavid Williams\u2014friend of the Girondins, participant in Sophie de\nCondorcet\u2019s salon, author of Lettres sur la libert\u00e9\npolitique [Letters on Political Liberty], and participant in the\npreparatory work for the Constitution\u2014wrote his Observations\nsur la derni\u00e8re constitution (Observations on the Last\nConstitution] (published 1793 in Paris). Williams supported education\nfor women, their right to testify in cases involving members of their\nown sex, and political rights for single women, spinsters as well as\nwidows. Moreover, an appeal for women\u2019s voting rights by deputy Pierre\nGuyomar entitled le Partisan de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des droits\net de l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 en fait [The Partisan of the\nEquality of Rights and Inequality in Fact] was discussed by the\nconstitutional draft commission. Guyomar seemingly draws upon\nCondorcet, comparing prejudice in sexual matters to those of race, and\ncalls for its outright abolition. And like Condorcet (and the authors\nof the 1789 \u201cLadies\u2019 Request\u201d), he points to the\nnation\u2019s outright hypocrisy, where the Declaration of Rights serves to\nperpetuate an aristocracy of men and smuggle in old r\u00e9gime\nprinciples. However, the weight of official opinion did not support\nthe inclusion of women into full citizenship. The Commission concluded\nin April 1793 that women lacked sufficient education to participate in\nthe nation\u2019s political life (see Roudinesco 1991,\n 129\u2013130).[18]\n By the fall of 1793, women would also be barred from participating in\nclubs and societies. Women in France would not achieve the ballot\nuntil 1944, and many of the advancements in civil law passed in the\n1790s were withdrawn by Napoleon, and not again fully secured until\nthe last half of the twentieth century.\n\nIn a sense, French women\u2019s lives were shaped almost entirely for far\ntoo long by the very institution against which Condorcet protested.\nIronically, this devoted father and husband was perhaps the only\nphilosophe who never kept a mistress, yet he was arguably\n\n\nthe one most critical of the family, as this institution was known in\nthe eighteenth century. The indissoluble character that the Church had\nconferred upon marriage appeared to him as a veritable seedbed of such\nevils as adultery, prostitution, and bastardy. (Rowe, in Rosenfield\n1984, 25)\n\n\nHe advocated for birth control, woman\u2019s right to plan her pregnancy\nsensibly, and for a man\u2019s obligation to his child\u2019s welfare after\nbirth. He envisioned a better future for illegitimate children and\nsupported opportunities for unmarried pregnant women to have their\nchildren without social penalties (Condorcet 1968, VI: 256\u20139,\nVIII: 465\u2013466; Williams 2004, 168\u2013169; Schapiro 1963,\n192\u2013193). He proposed occupational training rather than\nincarceration for prostitutes, opposed police harassment of\nprostitutes and homosexuals, and denounced barbaric laws and practices\nagainst homosexuals, such as France\u2019s burning of homosexuals alive and\nthe English resort to mob violence (Condorcet 1968, VIII:\n469\u201370, IV: 561; Schapiro 1963, 192\u2013195; Williams 2004,\n170). In the Esquisse he advocated for making marriage a\ncivil not a religious contract, as was formally accomplished by his\nfellow republicans in France during the 1790s. He upbraided the\ndespotic role of parents in arranging their children\u2019s marriage. He\nfavored divorce, and considered the manner in which child custody and\neducation should be protected in its event. In the place of what he\nconsidered the private despotism of family life in old r\u00e9gime\nFrance, and with the hope for women\u2019s expanded independence, Condorcet\nenvisioned the coming into being of more loving and egalitarian\nunions, much like the one he fashioned with his wife:\n\n\nEverything which can contribute to rendering individuals more\nindependent also increases the happiness they can reciprocally bestow\nupon each other; their happiness will be greater when the individual\naction is more voluntary. (Biblioth\u00e8que nationale ms. N.a. fr\n4586, fol. 18, cited and translated in Manuel 1962, 99)\n\n\nHad he lived longer, he would have seen many disappointments, watching\nas so many of the early Revolution\u2019s legislated reforms in marital and\npersonal life, as well as the whole panoply of human rights for which\nhe fought, were retracted, modified or suspended, and while political\nparticipation was crushed under the Directory and more emphatically\nunder Napoleon\u2019s rule. After his death, Condorcet was not entirely\nforgotten, and his contribution was honored throughout the nineteenth\ncentury in France, Britain, and elsewhere by those men and women who\nfought to bring down the refortified barriers to women\u2019s rights that\nwere paradoxically imposed by democrats and republicans who otherwise\nsaw themselves as liberal opponents of preceding regimes.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a id=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>", "<a id=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>", "<a id=\"RelLit\">Related Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a id=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>": ["</h3>\n<h4>Works by Condorcet</h4>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Baker, K.
