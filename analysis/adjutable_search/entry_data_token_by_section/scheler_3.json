    "main_text": "Others, Community and Solidarity\n4. Others, Community and Solidarity\n\nThere is, for Scheler, no problem of the other. This is not to say\nthat he rejects the alterity or difference of the other. What Scheler\nrejects is the presumed starting point of the so-called other minds, a\nstarting point that posits one mind over and against another, assuming\nthat we are first alone and then enter into relationships with others.\nThe consciousness of oneself as a self and as a person is always\nexperienced within the context of a \u201cmember of a totality\u201d\n(GW II, 510). Every experience, in other words, assumes as background\nthe \u201cexperiencing with one another\u201d (Miteinander-erleben)\nas well as the responsibility for others and the co-responsibility for\nthe community. All investigations that begin with the problem of the\nother presuppose this primordial communal background.\nPhenomenologically, the task is not to take this background for\ngranted but to clarify the different types of experiences that\nconstitute this communal background and those experiences that give\nrise to a sense of mine-ness and otherness.\n\nScheler\u2019s investigation into this primordial background begins\nat the affective or emotional level of experience. The affective life\nprecedes the intellectual life. In the case of the experience of\nothers, there is an affective or emotional understanding of others\nprior to any intellectual or rational understanding. The work\ndedicated to this investigation is Scheler\u2019s The Nature of\nSympathy (original German title, Wesen und Formen der\nSympathie literally means the Essence and Forms of\nSympathy). His main intent in this work was to show that it is\nimpossible to derive an ethic from merely shared feelings and\nconsequently to show that ethics assumes as original an intention of\nlove. In order to demonstrate this point, Scheler provides a detailed\nanalysis of the different types of shared feelings, which are\nthemselves irreducible to loving.\n\nThere are at least five different types of shared or co-feelings:\n\n\n\nFeeling with one another (Miteinanderf\u00fchlen):\n\nTwo or more people feel the same feeling together. Scheler\ngives an example of two parents. They share a love for their child and\nthey also share the pain or joy felt for that child. In the tragic\ndeath of a child, parents share the same pain, feeling the same\nsadness and loss together. Certainly, parents of a child will have\nmany different feelings for their child between them. Scheler is only\ndescribing the phenomenon of when parents feel the same feeling\ntogether.\n\n\nVicarious feeling (Nachf\u00fchlen):\n\nScheler refers to this type of shared feeling throughout his analysis,\nbut does not include it in his discussion of the specific types of\nco-feelings. In vicarious feeling, there is no genuine sharing or\nco-experiencing of a feeling. It is a type of grasping a feeling in\nthe other without any subsequent feeling of the grasped pain or joy, a\nfeeling at a distance. This grasping is not necessarily an\nintellectual comprehension, but an emotional or bodily comprehension.\nAny recognition of the feeling of others, including empathy, assumes\nsome form of vicarious feelings.\n\n\nFellow feeling (Mitgef\u00fchl):\n\nThis form of co-feeling is often referred to as sympathy or pity. Here\nthere is the intention of the other, a feeling for the other. When a\nfriend is in pain, not only do I share his or her pain, but I feel for\nmy friend. The shared feeling is not the same and there remains a\nclear distinction between me and the other. To distinguish fellow\nfeeling from vicarious feeling, Scheler uses the example of cruelty\n(GW VII, 25). The reason why human beings are so good at torture is\nthat we can vicariously feel and comprehend what it would be like to\nbe harmed in such a manner. In vicarious feeling, we do not feel the\nother\u2019s pain. In genuine cases of fellow feeling, we not only\nshare in the suffering the other feels, but we also feel for the\nperson who suffers, often motivated to act to end the\nsuffering.\n\n\nPsychic Contagion (Gef\u00fchlansteckung):\n\nExperiences in which a person is overtaken by a feeling to such an\nextent that he or she gets lost in it with others is the phenomenon of\npsychic contagion. Scheler uses the example of being taken over by the\njoyous atmosphere in a bar to make his point. After a difficult day\n\u201cat the office,\u201d you walk into a bar and are immediately\novertaken by the celebratory atmosphere, completely forgetting your\nday and troubles. In contrast to the other types of co-feeling,\npsychic contagion is the experience of losing yourself in the feeling\nor mood of the group. The \u201cI\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d become\na \u201cwe.\u201d In the midst of this experience, we do things we\nwould not necessarily do in a different setting. Psychic contagion\ncan, thus, be quite dangerous, as is the case with mob violence, for\ninstance.\n\n\nIdentification (Einsf\u00fchlung):\n\nNot to be confused with Einf\u00fchlung (empathy),\nidentification is a limit case of psychic contagion. In\nidentification, the \u201cI\u201d is lost and literally becomes the\nother. I no longer feel the pain in me, but only in the other. There\nis no distance between the I and you and I am transported, so to\nspeak, into the other, inhabiting his or her body as if it were mine.\nI may identify with the experience so deeply that I live it in the\nother. The experiences Scheler has in mind here are mystical\nexperiences where a person \u201cbecomes\u201d the god or hypnotic\nexperiences where the individual thinks and wills according to the\nhypnotist. (GW VII, 31)\n\n\nAll of these experiences of co-feeling are involuntary and take place\nregardless of whether we want to experience them. We become conscious\nof them only after the fact, realizing perhaps that we are already\nlaughing or crying. They demonstrate that at the most basic level, we\nare drawn to others and are inclined to participate in the lives and\nfeelings of others (GW VII, 241). This is most clearly evident in\ncases of self-deception or confusion, cases when two or more persons\nconfuse their ideas and experiences with each other\u2019s,\nforgetting whose experiences or ideas they were originally.\n\nIn Formalism in Ethics and a Non-Formal Ethics of Value,\nScheler builds upon these analyses to describe the distinctive types\nof communities in which human beings participate. This description\nfalls under the heading of \u201cCollective Person\u201d\n(Gesamtperson). Persons are act-centers, the unity in the\nexecution of acts. \u201cCollective Person\u201d refers to a\ndistinctive unity of the execution, what Scheler calls \u201csocial\nacts.\u201d Social acts are inherently directed at other persons and\nare only fully executed in relation to others. Examples of social acts\nare acts of promising, commanding, and obeying. A promise is not a\npromise until the other accepts it; a command is not a command if the\nother does not hear it, etc. These acts are distinct from the intimate\nor singularizing acts, acts such as self-consciousness, self-love,\nself-respect, etc. (GW II, 511) They are directed at the self and are\nfulfilled with reference only to the self. These different types of\nacts show that the person is both an individual and a member of a\ncommunity or collectivity. Distinguishing between different types of\nacts does not entail that we are many different persons. It means,\nrather, that our person, our style of being, is expressed both as an\nindividual and as a member of a community.\n\nScheler identifies four different types of communities or social\nunities.\n\n\n\nThe Herd or Mass:\n\nThis community type refers to a group formed through psychic contagion\nand other forms of involuntary repetition. As a member of a herd, one\nhas no self-consciousness. In the herd, one\u2019s actions are\ndictated by the whims and the irrationality of the masses. Caught up\nin the excitement or throes of the herd, one is no longer fully\nresponsible for his or her actions. For this reason, mass movements\nare potentially liberating as well as dangerous and susceptible to\ndictatorship.\n\n\nLife-Community (Lebensgemeinschaft):\n\nThis community type is formed through genuine acts of co-feeling and\nco-living. The subject of these shared feelings and experiences is,\nhowever, the community and not the individual. There is a sense of the\nself and a sense of belonging to a community with the others. But this\nself is not radically distinct from the community and the others.\nOne\u2019s striving is the striving of the community, a shared\npreferencing and valuing developed through traditions, rites, norms,\netc. In a life-community, there is a sense of solidarity, a sense of\nbeing responsible for others and for the group. This responsibility\nis, however, not fully moral and the solidarity is a\n\u201crepresentable solidarity.\u201d By\n\u201crepresentable,\u201d Scheler means that anyone in the group\ncan represent the others, can take responsibility for the others in\nthe same manner.\n\n\nSociety (Gesellschaft):\n\nAll communal bonds in a society are formed artificially and\nconsciously by each member (in contrast to the organic and unconscious\nbonds of a life-community). A society is made up of individuals who\nchoose to form relations for the sake of personal welfare,\nparticularly at the level of pleasure and utility. It has no reality\nbeyond the individuals who make up the collectivity; the whole is\nequal to the sum of its parts (whereas a life-community is a whole\nthat is greater than the sum of its parts). The formation of society\nis motivated by a fundamental mistrust in others, creating bonds for\nthe sake of security.\n\nMuch of Scheler\u2019s characterization of society has a negative\nring, particularly in comparison to what he says of the\nlife-community. He does make clear that society is the introduction of\nthe mature individual and the self-conscious human being. A member of\nthe life-community, by contrast, is not yet an individual and is, in\nthis respect, immature (unm\u00fcndig). For Scheler, the rise\nof society is a genuine development in history. Nonetheless, the\nlife-community is foundational for society. This is shown by virtue of\nthe contracts forming the bonds of society. Contracts are grounded in\nthe promise and assume a level of trust, a trust that is first\ncultivated in the life-community.\n\n\nCollective Person:\n\n\u201cCollective Person\u201d is the deepest and the most profound\nlevel of community. To a certain extent, it is the evolutionary\noutcome of both the life-community and society. But\n\u201contologically\u201d speaking, the loving community\n(Liebesgemeinschaft) is foundational for the other forms\nlisted above. What most distinctively characterizes the collective\nperson is its sense of solidarity. Each member of the community is not\nonly fully responsible for his or her actions, but is also\nco-responsible for the actions of others and of the community. In\ncontrast to the life-community, each member is self-aware of him or\nherself as an individual, as a fully realized person. Yet, in contrast\nto society, the individual is caught up in a network of relations with\nothers. The sense of solidarity in the collective person is that of an\n\u201cunrepresentable\u201d solidarity. Every member of the\ncollective person is absolutely unique. No one can stand in for anyone\nelse and each bears responsibility for others and for the\ngroup.\n\n\nWithin the notion of the collective person, Scheler describes three\ndifferent types: the state (or nation), culture (or people) and the\nchurch. The main difference between these three types is the range or\nextent of responsibility. Every citizen of the state is co-responsible\nfor every other citizen, a limit defined by state or national borders\n(as well as recognized members of the citizenry). A culture is\ndemarcated by the borders created by shared values, beliefs, and\nideas. These borders are often more expansive than a state, but many\ndifferent cultures can be found in a state. The church is the most\nexpansive of the types of collective persons and includes all finite\npersons. It is the fullest realization of what Scheler calls\n\u201cthe love community\u201d (Liebesgemeinschaft). The\nsense of solidarity concerns the salvation of all finite persons,\npast, present and future. Although these different types of collective\npersons can be ranked with respect to their related values (life,\nspirit, holy), they enjoy their own autonomy and Scheler insists upon\na clear divide between not only church and state, but also culture and\nstate.\n\nThe most crucial notion that arises from Scheler\u2019s analysis of\nthe collective person is that of solidarity. Solidarity assumes two\ndistinct types of responsibility: a responsibility for one\u2019s own\nactions and a co-responsibility for the actions of others.\nCo-responsibility does not compromise the autonomy of the individual.\nEvery person is fully responsible for his or her actions. For Scheler,\nco-responsibility is a radical form of questioning. When another\nperson commits an act of hate or violence, the questions implied in\nsolidarity are how such acts are possible and how I have participated\nin creating a world wherein such acts are possible. The act of hate\ncommitted by another person signals that I (and each member of the\ngiven community) have not loved deeply enough and that we as a\ncommunity have failed to bring about a world wherein hate does not\nexist (GW II, 526). Solidarity assumes the manner in which we have\nshared our lives and feelings with one another in a community, but\nalso the necessity for a person to act to end evil and injustice. The\npresence of evil in one\u2019s community demonstrates that every\nmember ought to love more fully and act so that evil is not possible.\nAt the level of the collective person, this call to responsibility is\nfelt uniquely by each person, revealing the uniqueness of one\u2019s\nrole in and for the community.\n\nSharing a community with others and sharing the responsibility for the\ncommunity with others is the context in which the person is formed and\nrealized. It is not the answer to the epistemological question\nregarding the knowledge of the other or of other minds. In his\nrelatively brief analysis of this question, Scheler agrees that the\ncore of the person is not given in perception, at least not in the\nsense that his or her physical body is given as an object of\nperception (GW VII, 238). Perception, however, is only one means of\ngivenness and hence only one means of access to the other. It is only\nin the act of love that the other person is given (GW II, 483). The\ngivenness of the other is irreducible to any physical or psychic\ncharacteristics. In the act of love, there is an immediate intuition\nof the person, an \u201cungrounded\u201d plus (GW VII, 168).\nEvidence of this plus is our inability to state the reasons and prove\nwhy we love the other even though we are certain of our love.\n\nLove, therefore, does not afford us a rational understanding of the\nother person. What it offers is a means by which to participate in the\nway of being and loving of the other. In order to\n\u201cunderstand\u201d the other, we have to love like the other (GW\nII, 169). Afforded in this experience of loving is access to the world\nof the other and the moral (or ideal) value of the other. It is not a\nmatter of reading the other\u2019s mind, of knowing what the other is\nthinking. Rather, love grants us an understanding of who the other is.\nThe deepest experiences of love for the other reveals the absolute or\nholy value of the other, grasping who the other could be or ought to\nbecome. For Scheler, it is possible that another person may know me\nbetter than I know myself and he or she may be able to direct me to my\nideal way of being (GW II, 483). The understanding of the other\nthrough love is a value comprehension. This is not a full disclosure\nof the other, but a deepening of appreciation of who the other is, an\nappreciation that calls me to love the other ever more profoundly.\n",
