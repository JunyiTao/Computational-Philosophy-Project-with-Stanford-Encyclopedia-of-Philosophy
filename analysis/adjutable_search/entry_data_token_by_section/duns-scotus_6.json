    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Matter and form, body and soul\n3.2 Matter and form, body and soul\n\nNow imagine some particular substance, say, me. Suppose I go from\nbeing pale to being tan. Now it is still I who exist both before and\nafter the sun has had its characteristic effect on me. This\nillustrates an important feature of substances: they can successively\nhave contrary accidents and yet retain their numerical identity. This\nsort of change is known, appropriately enough, as accidental change.\nIn an accidental change, a substance persists through the change,\nhaving first one accident and then another. But clearly not all\nchanges are accidental changes. There was once a time when I did not\nexist, and then I came into existence. We can\u2019t analyze this\nchange as an accidental change, since there doesn\u2019t seem to be\nany substance that persists through the change. Instead, a substance\nis precisely what comes into being; this is not an accidental but a\nsubstantial change. And yet there must be something that\npersists even through substantial change, since otherwise we\nwouldn\u2019t have change at all; substances would come to exist from\nnothing and disappear into nothing. Scotus follows Aristotle in\nidentifying matter as what persists through substantial\nchange and substantial form as what makes a given parcel of\nmatter the definite, unique, individual substance that it is. (There\nare also accidental forms, which are a substance\u2019s accidental\nqualities.)\n\nThus far Scotus is simply repeating Aristotelian orthodoxy, and none\nof his contemporaries or immediate predecessors would have found any\nof this at all strange. But as Scotus elaborates his views on form and\nmatter, he espouses three important theses that mark him off from some\nother philosophers of his day: he holds that matter can exist without\nany form whatsoever, that not all created substances are composites of\nform and matter, and that one and the same substance can have more\nthan one substantial form. Let us examine each of these theses in\nturn.\n\nFirst, Scotus argues that God can create and conserve what was called\n\u201cprime matter\u201d: that is, matter that has no form\nwhatsoever. (For an analysis of the arguments, see Ward 2014.) Matter\nand form are distinct things, as the case of substantial change makes\nclear: matter persists when forms come and go. Now that fact by itself\nmight be taken to show only that matter can exist apart from any\ngiven form (and Scotus thinks that too), but Scotus takes the\nseparability of matter and form even further. Divine omnipotence means\nthat God can cause immediately (that is, without a secondary cause)\nwhatever he ordinarily causes through a secondary cause. God\nordinarily causes matter through form; but given divine omnipotence,\nhe need not. He can create matter without any form. Moreover, given\nthat matter is a thing distinct from form, God creates matter directly\nand immediately; and what God creates immediately, he can conserve\nimmediately. So God can conserve matter without conserving any of the\nforms that characterize that matter.\n\nSecond, Scotus denies \u201cuniversal hylomorphism,\u201d the view\nthat all created substances are composites of form and matter\n(Lectura 2, d. 12, q. un., n. 55). Universal hylomorphism\n(from the Greek hyle, meaning \u2018matter\u2019, and\nmorphe, meaning \u2018form\u2019) had been the predominant\nview among Franciscans before Scotus. Saint Bonaventure, for example,\nhad argued that even angels could not be altogether immaterial; they\nmust be compounds of form and \u201cspiritual matter.\u201d For\nmatter is potentiality and form is actuality, so if the angels were\naltogether immaterial, they would be pure actuality without any\nadmixture of potentiality. But only God is pure actuality. But as we\nhave already seen in his affirmation of the existence of prime matter,\nScotus simply denies the unqualified equation of matter with\npotentiality and form with actuality. Prime matter, though entirely\nwithout form, could be actual; and a purely immaterial being is not\nautomatically bereft of potentiality.\n\nThird, Scotus holds that some substances have more than one\nsubstantial form (Ordinatio 4, d. 11, q. 3, n. 54). This\ndoctrine of the plurality of substantial forms was commonly held among\nthe Franciscans but vigorously disputed by others. We can very easily\nsee the motivation for the view by recalling that a substantial form\nis supposed to be what makes a given parcel of matter the definite,\nunique, individual substance that it is. Now suppose, as many medieval\nthinkers (including Aquinas) did, that the soul is the one and only\nsubstantial form of the human being. It would then follow that when a\nhuman being dies, and the soul ceases to inform that parcel of matter,\nwhat is left is not the same body that existed just before death;\nthere is an entirely new substance, with entirely new accidents (for\naccidents depend for their being on the substance in which they\ninhere). For what made it that very body was its substantial form,\nwhich (ex hypothesi) is no longer there.\n\nTo Scotus and many of his fellow Franciscans it therefore seemed\nobvious that we need to posit a plurality of substantial forms to\navoid these metaphysical incongruities. One standard form of such\npluralism postulated a \u201cform of the body\u201d (forma\ncorporeitatis) that makes a given parcel of matter to be a\ndefinite, unique, individual organism, and the \u201canimating\nform\u201d or soul, which makes that body alive. At death, the\nanimating soul ceases to vivify the body, but numerically the same\nbody remains, and the form of the body keeps the matter organized, at\nleast for a while. Since the form of the body is too weak on its own\nto keep the body in existence indefinitely, however, it gradually\ndecomposes.\n\nScotus\u2019s view is more complicated still, for he treats each\norgan of a living body as a substance (a composite of matter and\nsubstantial form). Whether Scotus also acknowledges a forma\ncorporeitatis over and above the forms of the bodily organs is\ndisputed (see Ward 2014, 90\u201393). If he does not, he must accept\nthe unpalatable conclusion that a corpse is not the same body as the\nbody of the organism. He can, however, avoid the conclusion that no\naccidents of that body remain: any accidents that inhere in the organs\ncan remain, because the organs are substances and continue to exist\n(for a while, anyway) when the body of which they were parts ceases to\nexist.\n\nNote that the general tendency of Scotus\u2019s theories of form and\nmatter is to allow a high degree of independence to form and matter.\nIn positing the existence of prime matter, Scotus envisions matter as\nexisting without any form; in denying universal hylomorphism, he\nenvisions form as existing without any matter. And the doctrine of the\nplurality of substantial forms strongly suggests that the human soul\nis an identifiable individual in its own right. So everything Scotus\nsays in this connection seems to make room for the\npossibility that the soul survives the death of the body and\ncontinues to exist as an immaterial substance in its own right. But\nScotus canvases a number of philosophical arguments for the claim that\nthis possibility is in fact realized, and he finds none of them\ncompelling. That the human soul survives the death of the body is\nsomething we can know only through faith.\n",
