    "main_text": "Meaning and Value || Semantics\n3.1 Semantics\n\nOne initial approach to determining the meaning of\n\u201cprivacy\u201d is to examine how it is related to similar\nwords. This is what is called the \u201csemantics\u201d of privacy.\nFirst, \u201cprivate\u201d should be distinguished from\n\u201cintimate\u201d (Gerstein 1978; Benn & Gaus 1983; Bok 1982;\nAllen 1988; Inness 1992; Dworkin 1994; see also the threefold\ndifferentiation of the meaning of \u201cprivate\u201d in Weinstein\n1971; for the discussion that follows, see Roessler 2001 [2005:\n9\u201312]). What is intimate can also be private, but is not\nnecessarily so: We also speak, for instance, of forms of \u201cpublic\nintimacy\u201d in aesthetic contexts (think of John Lennon and Yoko\nOno at the Hilton in Amsterdam). \u201cIntimacy\u201d has erotic or\nsexual connotations, as well as connotations of proximity and\nvulnerability that also\u2014but not only\u2014have to do with the\nexposure of one\u2019s body (Inness 1992). Secondly,\n\u201cprivate\u201d must be distinguished from \u201csecret\u201d.\nWhat is private can be secret, but it is not necessarily so. For\ninstance, the question of where I practice my religious beliefs is\nprivate, but not necessarily secret. Another example are medical data:\nthese data are informationally private but not secret; they are known\nto many people (in the health system) and we would not generally call\nthem \u201csecret\u201d.What is secret can be private, but is also\nnot necessarily so\u2014for example, when one speaks of state secrets\n(Bok 1982: 10\u201314; Mokrosinska 2020). Semantic overlaps occur\nwhen privacy is dependent on something being completely hidden or\nconcealed, in other words on a secret, as with secret diaries or\nsecret ballots. Of relevance here is Wasserstrom (1984), who\ninterprets privacy above all as the realm of what is secret, hidden or\nconcealed, and thus seeks to bring to light the connotations of\ndeception and deceit.\n\nAnother important semantic relation is that of the predicate\n\u201cprivate\u201d to the predicate \u201cpublic\u201d; the\nlatter is often defined in opposition to the former. In everyday\nlanguage, there are two distinct semantic models underlying the\nvarious uses of \u201cprivate\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d (Benn\n& Gaus 1983: 7\u201310). The first is an \u201conion\u201d\nmodel, which allows one to distinguish between different layers of\nprivacy. The center of the onion is the realm of personal or bodily\nintimacy and privacy, including not only one\u2019s body, but also\none\u2019s private diary, as opposed to which everything else is\nregarded as \u201cpublic\u201d. The second layer of the onion\ncomprises the classic realm of privacy, viz. the family and other\nintimate relationships. In opposition to the family, the outside world\nof society and the state constitutes the public realm. The outer layer\nof the onion is society at large\u2014the realm of economic\nstructures or public civil society\u2014that counts as\n\u201cprivate\u201d with respect to intervention by the state. It\ntherefore forms yet another realm of privacy in the face of the public\nrealm of the state and its possible interference (Okin 1991).\n\nIn a metaphorical sense, the second model in everyday usage lies\nperpendicular to the first. For this second semantic model, the term\n\u201cprivate\u201d is predicated of actions we carry out, or\ndecisions that we make, no matter where we happen to be. Going to\nchurch is thus a private matter. In this second sense, the concept of\nprivacy describes a protected sphere or dimension of action and\nresponsibility, where individuals can act in a way that is independent\nof decisions and influences from the public realm of state\ninstitutions and society at large. This second model also comprises\ninformational privacy, since information about myself which I want to\nkeep private (medical data etc) is not left at home, in a layer of the\nonion. I carry it with me wherever I go, therefore privacy has to be\napplicable wherever we are.\n",
