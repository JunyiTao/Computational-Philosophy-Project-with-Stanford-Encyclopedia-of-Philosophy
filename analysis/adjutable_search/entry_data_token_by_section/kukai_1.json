    "main_text": "Historical Background of Esoteric Buddhism\n2. Historical Background of Esoteric Buddhism\n\nK\u016bkai called his form of Buddhism, Shingon, which means\n\u201cthe word of truth.\u201d This is the Japanese pronunciation of\nthe Chinese chen-yen (zhenyan) and the Sanskrit\nmantra. The form of Buddhism that he learned in China was an\nimportation from India of Mantray\u0101na (Mantra vehicle\n{or: \u201cschool\u201d}) Buddhism, more often known as\nVajray\u0101na (Diamond {or: \u201cLightning Fast\u201d}\nvehicle). The word mantra signifies a secret teaching\ninexpressible in ordinary words or linguistic formulations. This form\nof Buddhism, whose origin dates back to the mid-seventh century India,\nis more popularly known today in the West as \u201cTantric\nBuddhism,\u201d especially in its Tibetan incarnation. It is\ncharacterized by its emphasis upon rituals, involving the use of\nmantras, mandalas, and other means in order to control both body and\nmind to experience the \u201cultimate.\u201d Two major texts,\nassociated with this form of Buddhism, made their way into China from\nIndia: Mah\u0101vairocana S\u016btra (Jpn:\nDainichi-ky\u014d) from the mid-seventh century and\nVajra\u015bekhara S\u016btra (Jpn:\nKong\u014dch\u014d-gy\u014d) from the later-seventh century.\nMantray\u0101na made its way east to China during the T\u2019ang\ndynasty (713\u2013765) around the beginning of the eighth century\nthrough the translating and propagating efforts of the Indian priests\n\u015aubh\u0101karasimha (Jpn: Zenmui; 637\u2013735) who brought the\nMah\u0101vairocana S\u016btra to China; Vajrabodhi (Jpn:\nKong\u014dchi; 671\u2013741), the sixth patriarch of Mantray\u0101na,\nwho brought the Vajra\u015bekhara S\u016btra to China; and\nAmoghavajra (Jpn: Fuk\u016b, an abbreviation for Fuk\u016bkong\u014d;\n705\u201374), Vajrabodhi\u2019s disciple, who won the support of\nsuccessive emperors during the T\u2019ang period; and the Chinese\npriest, I-hsing (Yixing; Jpn: Ichigy\u014d; 683\u2013727) who learned\nthe teachings of Mah\u0101vairocana S\u016btra from\n\u015aubh\u0101karasimha and the teachings of Vajra\u015bekhara\nS\u016btra from Varjabodhi. K\u016bkai\u2019s own teacher\nHui-kuo had also received initiation under both lineages of these two\nmajor s\u016btras, and is credited with gathering together their\nteachings into one system. In the meantime during the eighth century,\nanother branch of Mantray\u0101na made it north from India to Tibet.\nBut Chen-yen Buddhism in China did not survive the severe persecution\nof Buddhism in general in 845. K\u016bkai however had by then already\nsucceeded in transmitting to Japan the esoteric doctrines he had\nstudied in China. For much of the doctrines and practices, which he\nhad imported, became influential amongst the official Nara\nmonasteries. But his form of Buddhism was not just a product of his\ninheritance and appropriation of the Buddhism he encountered in China.\nAs it involved developments and contributions uniquely his own, we may\nregard him not only as the transmitter but as the founder of\nthe Japanized version of Mantray\u0101na known as\nShingon.\n",
