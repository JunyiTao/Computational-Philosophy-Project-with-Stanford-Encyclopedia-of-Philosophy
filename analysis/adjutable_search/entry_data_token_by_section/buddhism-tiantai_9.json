We can say all things are\npermanent\u2014meaning \u201cpermanent-impermanent\u201d. We can\nsay some things are permanent and others are impermanent\u2014meaning\n\u201csome-all are permanent-impermanent\u201d and \u201call-some\nare impermanent-permanent\u201d. But note too that this does not mean\n\u201cpermanent-impermanent\u201d is the real truth, while\n\u201cpermanent\u201d and \u201cimpermanent\u201d are both\none-sided distortions. That would be what Tiantai critiques as the\n\u201cexclusive Center\u201d. Rather, just as\n\u201cpermanent\u201d really means\n\u201cimpermanent-permanent\u201d,\n\u201cimpermanent-permanent\u201d really means\n\u201cpermanent\u201d, or really means\n\u201cimpermanent\u201d. For impermanent-permanent appears\nas permanence and as impermanence, and each of these\nis the entirety, not a mere part, of the whole. To be permanent is\nalready to also be impermanent\u2014there is no other permanence. To\nbe impermanent is already to also be permanent\u2014there is no other\nimpermanence. All is funny, all is serious, all is funny-serious. Each\nis a perfectly equal synonym for all three. Each is an equally\nadequate-inadequate description of the truth.\n\nThe same applies in all other cases. We can say all is\nsuffering\u2014meaning \u201csuffering-bliss\u201d. We can say all\nis bliss\u2014meaning \u201cbliss-suffering\u201d. We can say all\nis mind\u2014meaning \u201cmind-matter\u201d. We can say all is\nmatter\u2014meaning \u201cmatter-mind\u201d. We can say there is a\nGod\u2014meaning \u201cGod-Godless\u201d. We can say there is no\nGod\u2014meaning \u201cGodless-God\u201d. We can say all is\nillusion\u2014meaning \u201cillusion-reality\u201d. We can say all\nis reality\u2014meaning \u201creality-illusion\u201d. We can say\nsome things are true and some things are false\u2014meaning\n\u201csome-all is true-false and all-some is false-true\u201d. We\ncan say there is historical progress\u2014meaning\n\u201cprogress-stagnation\u201d. We can say there is historical\nstagnation\u2014meaning \u201cstagnation-progress\u201d. We can say\nsociety is evil\u2014meaning \u201cevil-good\u201d. We can say\nsociety is good\u2014meaning \u201cgood-evil\u201d. We can say we\nare sometimes happy and sometimes sad\u2014meaning \u201cwe-everyone\nare sometimes-always happy-sad and sometimes-always sad-happy\u201d.\nAnd so on. How should we choose which will we say at any time? If all\nthings are sayable in some sense, what should we say right now? We\nshould say whatever is most conducive to liberation from suffering,\nfrom one-sided attachments, in this particular situation and\ncontext.\n",
