    "main_text": "What is Biodiversity?\n1. What is Biodiversity?\n\nStrangely enough, we can roughly date when the term\n\u2018biodiversity\u2019 was coined (Takacs 1996: 34\u201340). It\noccurred during the National Forum on BioDiversity sponsored by the\nSmithsonian Institution and the National Academy of the Sciences\n21\u201324 September 1986. Approximately 14,000 people attended what was a\nmedia spectacle that included the likes of Jared Diamond, Paul\nEhrlich, Thomas Eisner, G. Evelyn Hutchinson, Ernst Mayr, Charles D.\nMichener, Harold A. Mooney, Peter Raven, and E. O. Wilson. The coiner\nof the term is thought to be Walter G. Rosen. He said,\n\n\nIt was easy to do: all you do is take the \u2018logical\u2019 out of\n\u2018biological\u2019\u2026. To the take the logical out of\nsomething that\u2019s supposed to be science is a bit of a\ncontradiction in terms, right? And yet, of course, maybe so logical\nthat there seems to be no room for emotion in there, no room for\nspirit. (Takacs 1996: 37)\n\n\nAs David Takacs noted, a search in Biological Abstracts for\nthe year 1988 would not contain it as a keyword. For 1993, it appeared\nseventy-two times. As of March 2015, Google Scholar reports that\n\u2018biodiversity\u2019 appears in the title of over one hundred\nthousand papers. The term clearly has caught on. But, we are getting\nahead of ourselves.\n\nConservation biology clearly concerns conserving something biological\nor ecological, but what is or should be conserved? Work has focused on\na variety of units. As examples, some have focused on species such as\nthe spotted owl Strix occidentalis (Yaffee 1994) and\nloggerhead turtle Caretta caretta (Bolten & Witherington\n2003); some have focused on populations and sub-species such as wild\nsalmon Oncorhynchus spp. (Quinn 2005); some have focused on\nbiomes or eco-regions such as tropical coral in the Great Barrier Reef\n(Hutchings, Kingsford, & Hoegh-Guldberg 2008); and finally some\nhave focused on genotypes or genetic features such as heterozygosity\n(Avise & Hamrick 1996). However, in the 1980s, conservation\nbiologists united and argued that biodiversity should be the\nfocus of the discipline (E. O. Wilson 1988; see entry on\n biodiversity).\n What then is biodiversity? Here is a standard definition from an\ninfluential textbook.\n\n\nBiological diversity, or biodiversity, is the sum total of all living\nthings\u2014the immense richness and variation of the living world.\nBiodiversity can be considered at many levels of biological variation,\nranging from genetic variability within a species, to the biota of\nsome selected region of the globe, to the number of evolutionary\nlineages and the degree of distinctness among them, to the diversity\nof ecosystems and biomes on Earth. (Groom et al. 2006: 27)\n\n\nInformally then, biodiversity is variation at all levels of the\nbiological hierarchy. To conserve biodiversity would then to be to\nconserve all of this variation. However, there are two fundamental\nissues to be resolved. First, there is an issue of practicality. As\nphilosopher and conservation biologist Sahotra Sarkar writes,\n\n\nConserving biodiversity, and construing the term intuitively to refer\nto all the biological diversity that there is, at every level of both\nhierarchies amounts to saying that \u201cbiodiversity\u201d refers\nto all biological entities. \u201cBiodiversity\u201d in effect\nbecomes all of biology. Conservation would be an impractical proposal\nif biodiversity were construed in this way: everything biological\nwould become a goal of conservation. (Sarkar 2005: 180)\n\n\nIn fact the issue is more complicated than even this. In order to\nestimate the amount of biodiversity with regard to a place, we must\nfind some true surrogate (Margules & Sarkar 2007: Ch. 2). A true\nsurrogate is some feature that strongly correlates with biodiversity.\nSuppose we used species as a true surrogate. With few exceptions, we\ncannot simply observe the species present in some locale; we can only\nobserve some of its members. We must use some estimator surrogate for\nthe true surrogate too; e.g., soil, vegetation, precipitation, etc.\nThus, we estimate biodiversity twice removed. Second, since we cannot\nconserve all biological variation, we need a principled way to decide\nwhat to conserve. As we saw above, conservation biologists have\nrefined their account to include variation in genes, species, and\necosystems. This is still far too broad since there is a great deal of\n\u201cjunk DNA\u201d; often we want to conserve wild populations\n(e.g., wild salmon versus hatchery salmon); and rare habitats are\noften considered more important than common ones (Morgan 2009).\n\nIn the remainder of this section, we consider three recent proposals\nconcerning what biodiversity is (and is not) that try to characterize\nbiodiversity in a practical and principled manner.\n",
