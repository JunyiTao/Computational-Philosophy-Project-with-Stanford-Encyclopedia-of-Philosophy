    "main_text": "The functional question: Why does consciousness exist? || Constitutive and contingent roles\n6.8 Constitutive and contingent roles\n\n\nOne further point requires clarification about the various respects\nin which the proposed functions might answer the Why question. In\nparticular one should distinguish between constitutive cases\nand cases of contingent realization. In the former, fulfilling\nthe role constitutes being conscious in the relevant sense, while in\nthe latter case consciousness of a given sort is just one way among\nseveral in which the requisite role might be realized (Van Gulick\n1993).\n\n\nFor example, making information globally available for use by a wide\nvariety of subsystems and behavioral applications may constitute its\nbeing conscious in the access sense. By contrast, even if the\nqualitative and phenomenal forms of consciousness involve a highly\nunified and densely integrated representation of objective reality, it\nmay be possible to produce representations having those functional\ncharacteristics but which are not qualitative or phenomenal in\nnature.\n\n\nThe fact that in us the modes of representation with those\ncharacteristics also have qualitative and phenomenal properties may\nreflect contingent historical facts about the particular design\nsolution that happened to arise in our evolutionary ancestry. If so,\nthere may be quite other means of achieving a comparable result without\nqualitative or phenomenal consciousness. Whether this is the right way\nto think about phenomenal and qualitative conscious is unclear; perhaps\nthe tie to unified and densely integrated representation is in fact as\nintimate and constitutive as it seems to be in the case of access\nconsciousness (Carruthers 2000). Regardless of how that issue gets\nresolved, it is important to not to conflate constitution accounts with\ncontingent realization accounts when addressing the function of\nconsciousness and answering the question of why it exists (Chalmers\n1996).\n",
