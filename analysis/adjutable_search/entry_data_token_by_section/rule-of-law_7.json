    "main_text": "History of the Rule of Law || Hayek\n3.5 Hayek\n\nF.A. Hayek was by training an economist, but he also nurtured an\ninterest in the relation between legal structures and forms of\nnational economy. Hayek\u2019s work on the Rule of Law proceeded in\ntwo phases: (1) from his wartime book The Road to Serfdom\n(1944) through to The Constitution of Liberty (Hayek 1960);\nand (2) the somewhat different account presented in his trilogy,\nLaw, Legislation and Liberty (1973), an account which is more\ncongenial to the spirit of common law and hostile to the role of\nlegislation.\n\n(1) Governance during wartime necessarily required total mobilization\nand management of all of the society\u2019s manpower and resources.\nHayek warned in 1944 against the retention of anything like this mode\nof administration in peacetime. He made an eloquent argument that in\nnormal times a society need not be managed but should be\ngoverned\u2014and its people largely left to their own\ndevices\u2014within a framework of general rules laid down in\nadvance. These rules would operate impersonally to protect people from\none another, not being aimed at any person or situation in particular\nand not being dependent for their operation on any expectation on the\npart of government as to what the particular effects of their\napplication would be. But this lack of particular knowledge on the\npart of the government would be offset by the fact that rules would\nprovide a framework of predictability for ordinary people and\nbusinesses. They would know that they would not be molested by the\nstate, provided they operated within the parameters of the general and\nimpersonal rules. Human freedom, on Hayek\u2019s account, did not\npreclude all state action; but it does require that state action be\ncalculable.\n\n(2) In the 1970s, Hayek began to rethink all this. The attention was\nstill on the implications of Rule of Law for liberty. But now Hayek\nbegan to wonder whether the texts of clear general legislated rules\nwould really provide an appropriate framework for freedom. It was, he\nsaid, a mistake to think that \u201cby confining the judge to the\napplication of already articulated rules we will increase the\npredictability of his decisions\u201d. Articulated rules are\n\u201coften a very imperfect formulation of principles which people\ncan better honour in action than express in words\u201d (Hayek 1973:\n118). He favored something more like a common law model of\npredictability, with principles and solutions emerging from a series\nof judicial decisions in an almost evolutionary\n way.[1]\n The evolution of principles that distinguished themselves by their\nreasonableness was superior, Hayek thought, to the deliberate\nimposition of rules by a legislator. According to Hayek, the\nlegislative mentality is inherently managerial; it is oriented in the\nfirst instance to the organization of the state\u2019s own\nadministrative apparatus; and its extension into the realm of public\npolicy generally means an outward projection of that sort of\nmanagerial mentality with frightful consequences for liberty and\nmarkets. \n",
