    "main_text": "Boltzmannian Statistical Mechanics (BSM) || Defining Equilibrium: Boltzmann\u2019s Combinatorial Argument\n4.2 Defining Equilibrium: Boltzmann\u2019s Combinatorial Argument\n\nAn influential way of defining equilibrium goes back to Boltzmann\n(1877); for contemporary discussion of the argument see, for instance,\nAlbert (2000), Frigg (2008b), and Uffink (2007). The approach first\nfocusses on the state space of one particle of the system, which in\nthe case of a gas has six dimensions (three for the particle\u2019s\npositions in each spatial dimension and a further three for the\ncorresponding momenta). We then introduce a grid on this\nspace\u2014an operation known as coarse-graining\u2014and\nsay that two particles have the same coarse-grained\nmicro-state if they are in the same grid cell. The state of the\nentire gas is then represented by an arrangement, a\nspecification of \\(n\\) points on this space (one for each particle in\nthe gas). But for the gas\u2019 macro-properties it is irrelevant\nwhich particle is in which state, meaning that the gas\u2019\nmacro-state must be unaffected by a permutation of the particles. All\nthat the macro-state depends on is the distribution of\nparticles, a specification of how many particles are in each grid\ncell.\n\nThe core idea of the approach is to determine how many arrangements\nare compatible with a given distribution, and to define the\nequilibrium state as the one for which this number is maximal. Making\nthe strong (and unrealistic) assumption that the particles in the gas\nare non-interacting (which also means that they never collide) and\nthat the energy of the gas is preserved, Boltzmann offered a solution\nto this problem and showed that the distribution for which the number\nof arrangements is maximal is the so-called discrete Maxwell-Boltzmann\ndistribution: \n\\[n_{i} = \\alpha\\exp\\left({-\\beta} E_{i} \\right),\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(n_{i}\\) is the number of particles in cell \\(i\\) if the\ncoarse-graining, \\(E_{i}\\) is the energy of a particle in that cell,\nand \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are constants that depend on the number\nof particles and the temperature of the system (Tolman 1938 [1979]:\nCh. 4). From a mathematical point of view, deriving this distribution\nis a problem in combinatorics, which is why the approach is now known\nas the combinatorial argument.\n\nAs Paul and Tatiana Ehrenfest pointed out in their 1911 [1959] review,\nthe mathematical structure of the argument also shows that if we now\nreturn to the state space \\(X\\) of the entire system (which, recall,\nhas \\(6n\\) dimensions), the macro-region of the equilibrium state thus\ndefined is the largest of all macro-regions. Hence, the equilibrium\nmacro-state is the macro-state with the largest macro-region. In\ncontemporary discussions this is customarily glossed as the\nequilibrium macro-state not only being larger than any other\nmacro-state, but as being enormously larger and in fact taking up most\nof \\(X\\) (see, for instance, Goldstein 2001). However, as Lavis (2008)\npoints out, the formalism only shows that the equilibrium macro-region\nis larger than any other macro-region and it is not a general truism\nthat it takes up most of the state space; there are in fact systems in\nwhich the non-equilibrium macro-regions taken together are larger than\nthe equilibrium macro-region.\n\nSince, as we have seen, the Boltzmann entropy is a monotonic function\nof the measure of a macro-region, this implies that the equilibrium\nmicrostate is also the macro-state with the largest Boltzmann entropy,\nand the approach to equilibrium is a process that can be characterised\nby an increase of entropy.\n\nTwo questions arise: first, is this a tenable general definition of\nequilibrium, and, second, how does it explain the approach to\nequilibrium? As regards the first question, Uffink (2007) highlights\nthat the combinatorial argument assumes particles to be\nnon-interacting. The result can therefore be seen as a good\napproximation for dilute gases, but it fails to describe (even\napproximately) interacting systems like liquids and solids. But\nimportant applications of SM are to systems that are not dilute gases\nand so this is a significant limitation. Furthermore, from a\nconceptual point of view, the problem is that a definition of\nequilibrium in terms of the number of arrangements compatible with a\ndistribution makes no contact with the thermodynamic notion of\nequilibrium, where equilibrium is defined as the state to which an\nisolated system converges when left to itself (Werndl & Frigg\n2015b). Finally, this definition of equilibrium is completely\ndisconnected form the system\u2019s dynamics, which has the odd\nconsequence that it would still provide an equilibrium state even if\nthe system\u2019s time evolution was the identity function (and hence\nnothing ever changed and no approach to equilibrium took place). And\neven if one were to set thermodynamics aside, there is nothing truly\nmacro about the definition, which in fact directly constructs a\nmacro-region without ever specifying a macro-state.\n\nA further problem (still as regards the first question) is the\njustification of coarse-graining. The combinatorial argument does not\nget off the ground without coarse-grained micro-states, and so the\nquestion is what legitimises the use of such states. The problem is\naccentuated by the facts that the procedure only works for particular\nkind of coarse-graining (namely if the grid is parallel to the\nposition and momentum axes) and that the grid cannot be eliminated by\ntaking a limit which lets the grid size tend toward zero. A number of\njustificatory strategies have been proposed but none is entirely\nsatisfactory. A similar problem arises with coarse-gaining in Gibbsian\nSM, and we refer the reader to\n Section 6.5\n for a discussion.\n\nAs regards the second question, the combinatorial argument itself is\nsilent about why and how systems approach equilibrium and additional\ningredients must be added to the account to provide such an\nexplanation. Before discussing some of these ingredients (which is the\ntopic of much of the remainder of this section), let us discuss two\nchallenges that every explanation of the approach to equilibrium must\naddress: the reversibility problem and the recurrence problem.\n",
