    "main_text": "Schopenhauer\u2019s Methodology in Aesthetics\n2. Schopenhauer\u2019s Methodology in Aesthetics\n\n\nAs with his philosophy as a whole, Schopenhauer takes his point of\ndeparture in aesthetics from Kant, praising him for deepening the\nsubjective turn in philosophical aesthetics and thereby putting it on\nthe right path (WWR I, Appendix, 560\u201361. Note: page references\nto vol. I refer to the Cambridge edition translation; references to\nvol. II to the Payne transl.).  Like Kant, he held that the phenomenon\nof beauty would only be illuminated through a careful scrutiny of its\neffects on the subject, rather than by proceeding in the pre-Kantian\nobjectivist fashion, searching out the properties of\nobjects\u2014such as smoothness, delicacy and smallness\u2014which\nputatively give rise to the feeling of the beautiful. But the\nsubjective turn is as far as Kant\u2019s aesthetic-methodological\nmerit extends, according to Schopenhauer: it is too indirect, due to\nKant\u2019s primary method in philosophy, the transcendental\nargument.\n\n\nApplied to the phenomenon of beauty in the Critique of the Power\nof Judgment, Kant starts from an analysis of the judgments that\nthe subject makes about the objects of experience, e.g., \u201cthis\nrose is beautiful.\u201d After offering an analysis of the logic of\nsuch aesthetic judgments\u2014that they are based on feeling, more\nparticularly on a feeling of disinterested pleasure, but that they also\nclaim universal subjective validity\u2014Kant then searches for the\na priori conditions for the possibility of making judgments\nthat have this logical form. \n\n\nBy contrast, Schopenhauer does not believe that the aesthetician\nshould start from the aesthetic judgment, but rather from\nimmediate aesthetic experience, before the subject attempts\nto formulate judgments about that experience (WWR I,\n530\u2013531). The advocacy of this focus, rather than Kant\u2019s\nfocus on judgments, has to do with the ways in which Schopenhauer\ndeparts from Kant\u2019s epistemology. Very briefly, the key issue\nhas to do with the status of non-conceptual knowledge. As Kant\nfamously held, \u201c[t]houghts without content are empty, intuitions\nwithout concepts are blind\u201d\n(A50\u201351/B74\u201375). Schopenhauer adheres to the first clause,\nbut holds that there is indeed what today philosophers might call\n\u201cnon-conceptual content,\u201d and what he referred to\nvariously as \u201cintuitive cognition\u201d [intuitive\nErkenntni\u00df], \u201cknowledge of perception\u201d [anschauliche\nErkenntni\u00df] or \u201cfeeling\u201d [das Gef\u00fchl]. This\ncognition allows us\u2014and many non-human animals\u2014to navigate\nand operate in the world to a great extent without\nconcepts. Furthermore, for Schopenhauer, this is the kind of knowledge\nwe gain, par excellence, through aesthetic experiences of\nnature and art; but this knowledge is not or at least not-yet\nconceptual, though it is a knowledge of the \u201cPlatonic\nIdeas\u201d or essential features of the phenomenal world (more on\nthe Ideas at section 3.2).\n\n\nIn order to preserve for ourselves or to communicate\n\u201cintuitive knowledge\u201d to others, we may try to\nshow it or say it. If one is an artist, one might\nshow such knowledge by attempting to embody it in a work of art. But\nfor non-artists, trying to \u2018say\u2019 this knowledge means\nattempting to capture it propositionally, and in so doing, for\nSchopenhauer, we translate intuitive into conceptual knowledge\nby a process of abstraction. Unfortunately, something is inevitably lost in the\ntranslation. Thus, Schopenhauer concludes, Kant\u2019s starting\npoint\u2014the aesthetic judgment\u2014is already at one remove from true\naesthetic experience. And since this remove is not innocuous, insofar\nas the judgment does not faithfully transmit the richness of the\nexperience, the aesthetic judgment constitutes the wrong focus for\naesthetic theorizing.\n\n\nFundamentally, however, the gap between aesthetic experience and\naesthetic judgments yields an essential difficulty for aesthetic\ntheories since these are necessarily formulated\npropositionally, and therefore cannot entirely capture the richness of\nimmediate, first-personal aesthetic experience. To his credit,\nSchopenhauer is quite frank about the methodological limits of\naesthetic theorizing, especially in the case of music (WWR I, section\n52; see also Goehr 1998; and\n section 5.2.5 below). Nonetheless, he ventures\nforth to offer just such a theory\nin the hopes that through it he may convince the reader of the\n\u201cimportance and high value of art (which are seldom sufficiently\nrecognized)\u201d (WWR I, 294) and to help the reader enter a\npsychological space where she herself can gain the deep insights\nafforded by nature and the fine arts.\n",
