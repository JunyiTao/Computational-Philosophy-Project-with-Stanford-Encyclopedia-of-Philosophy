It comes as no surprise to read that Socrates\nindicts rhapsodes on the grounds that their speeches proceed\n\u201cwithout questioning and explanation\u201d and \u201care given\nonly in order to produce conviction\u201d (277e8\u20139). This\nechoes the Ion\u2019s charge that the rhapsodes do not know what\nthey are talking about. But what about the rationale that the poets\nand rhapsodes are inspired?\n\nInspiration comes up numerous times in the Phaedrus. It and\nthe related notions of Bacchic frenzy, madness, and possession are\ninvoked repeatedly almost from the start of the dialogue (228b), in\nconnection with Phaedrus\u2019 allegedly inspiring recitation of Lysias\u2019\ntext (234d1\u20136), and as inspiring Socrates\u2019s two speeches\n(237a7\u2013b1, 262d2\u20136, 263d1\u20133). These references are\nuniformly playful, even at times joking. More serious is the\ndistinction between ordinary madness and divine madness, and the\ndefense of the superiority of divine madness, which Socrates\u2019 second\nspeech sets out to defend. In particular, he sets out to show that the\nmadness of love or eros \u201cis given us by the gods to ensure our\ngreatest good fortune\u201d (245b7\u2013c1). The case is first made by\nnoting that three species of madness are already accepted: that of the\nprophets, that of certain purifying or cathartic religious rites, and\nthe third that inspiration granted by the Muses that moves its\npossessor to poetry (244b-245a). As noted, it begins to look as though\na certain kind of poetry (the inspired) is being rehabilitated.\n\nAnd yet when Socrates comes to classify kinds of lives a bit further\non, the poets (along with those who have anything to do with\nmimesis) rank a low sixth out of nine, after the likes of\nhousehold managers, financiers, doctors, and prophets (248e1\u20132)!\nThe poet is just ahead of the manual laborer, sophist, and tyrant. The\nphilosopher comes in first, as the criterion for the ranking concerns\nthe level of knowledge of truth about the Ideas or Forms of which the\nsoul in question is capable. This hierarchy of lives could scarcely be\nsaid to rehabilitate the poet. The Phaedrus quietly sustains\nthe critique of poetry, as well as (much less quietly) of\nrhetoric.\n",
