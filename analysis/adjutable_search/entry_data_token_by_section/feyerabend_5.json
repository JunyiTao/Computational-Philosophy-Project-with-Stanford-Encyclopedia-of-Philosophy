The bullet in his\nspine left him impotent for the rest of his life. (His descriptions of\nsubsequent sexual encounters are one of the more amusing parts of his\nautobiography). Although he started off completely ignorant of women,\nhe married four times, and had, by his own account, plenty of affairs.\nBut he seems to have been distant not just in his relationship with\nhis parents, but in some of his marriages too. He hated the slavery\nlove seemed to imply, but hated equally the freedom achieved by taking\nevasive action. He got bogged down in cycles of dependence, isolation,\nand renewed dependence, which only dissolved into a more balanced\npattern after many years. \n\nAt the end of the war, Feyerabend went to the mayor of Apolda and\nasked for a job. He was assigned to the education section, given an\noffice and a secretary and, fittingly, put in charge of\nentertainment.\n\nIn 1946, having recovered from paralysis, he received a state\nfellowship to return to study singing and stage-management for a year\nat the Musikhochschule in Weimar. He moved from Apolda to\nWeimar after about three months. At the Weimar Institut zur\nMethodologischen Erneuerung des Deutschen Theaters he studied\ntheatre, and at the Weimar academy he took classes in Italian,\nharmony, piano, singing and enunciation. Singing remained one of his\nlife\u2019s major interests. He attended performances (drama, opera,\nballet, concerts) at Weimar\u2019s Nationaltheater, and\nlater reminisced about opera stars of the time, recalling debates and\narguments about theatre (e.g. the stereotyping of roles and plays)\nwith Maxim Vallentin, Hans Eisler, etc. He also played a small part in\none of the films of G.W.Pabst, a notable German film-director.\nAlthough, by his own account, he led a full life, he became restless\nand decided to move.\n",
