    "main_text": "Probability in the MWI || Illusion of Probability from Post-Measurement Uncertainty\n4.2 Illusion of Probability from Post-Measurement Uncertainty\n\nVaidman 1998 introduced the ignorance probability of an agent in the\nframework of the MWI in a situation of post-measurement\nuncertainty, see also Tappenden 2011, Vaidman 2012, Tipler 2014,\n2019b, Schwarz 2015. It seems senseless to ask: \u201cWhat is the\nprobability that Lev in the world \\(A\\) will observe \\(A\\)?\u201d\nThis probability is trivially equal to 1. The task is to define the\nprobability in such a way that we could reconstruct the prediction of\nthe standard approach, where the probability for \\(A\\) is 1/3. It is\nindeed senseless to ask you what is the probability that Lev\nin the world \\(A\\) will observe \\(A\\), but this might be a meaningful\nquestion when addressed to Lev in the world of the outcome \\(A\\).\nUnder normal circumstances, the world \\(A\\) is created (i.e. measuring\ndevices and objects which interact with measuring devices become\nlocalized according to the outcome \\(A)\\) before Lev is aware of the\nresult \\(A\\). Then, it is sensible to ask this Lev about his\nprobability of being in world \\(A\\). There is a definite outcome which\nthis Lev will see, but he is ignorant of this outcome at the time of\nthe question. In order to make this point vivid, Vaidman 1998 proposed\nan experiment in which the experimenter is given a sleeping pill\nbefore the experiment. Then, while asleep, he is moved to room \\(A\\)\nor to room \\(B\\) depending on the results of the experiment. When the\nexperimenter has woken up (in one of the rooms), but before he has\nopened his eyes, he is asked \u201cIn which room are you?\u201d\nCertainly, there is a matter of fact about which room he is in (he can\nlearn about it by opening his eyes), but he is ignorant about this\nfact at the time of the question.\n\nThis construction provides the ignorance interpretation of\nprobability, but the value of the probability has to be\npostulated:\n\nProbability Postulate\n\nAn observer should set his subjective probability of the outcome of a\nquantum experiment in proportion to the total measure of existence of\nall worlds with that outcome.\n\nThis postulate (named the Born-Vaidman rule by Tappenden\n2011) is a counterpart of the collapse postulate of the standard\nquantum mechanics according to which, after a measurement, the quantum\nstate collapses to a particular branch with probability proportional\nto its squared amplitude. (See the section on the measurement problem\nin the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory.)\n However, it differs in two aspects. First, it parallels only the\nsecond part of the collapse postulate, the Born Rule, and second, it\nis related only to part (ii) of the MWI, the connection to our\nexperience, and not to the mathematical part of the theory (i).\n\nThe question of the probability of obtaining A makes sense for Lev in\nworld A before he becomes aware of the outcome and for Lev in world B\nbefore he becomes aware of the outcome. Both \u201cLev\u201ds have\nthe same information on the basis of which they should give their\nanswer. According to the probability postulate they will give the\nsame answer: 1/3 (the relative measure of existence of the\nworld \\(A)\\). Since Lev before the measurement is associated with two\n\u201cLev\u201ds after the measurement who have identical ignorance\nprobability concepts for the outcome of the experiment, one can define\nthe probability of the outcome of the experiment to be performed as\nthe ignorance probability of the successors of Lev for being in a\nworld with a particular outcome.\n\nThe \u201csleeping pill\u201d argument does not reduce the\nprobability of an outcome of a quantum experiment to a familiar\nconcept of probability in the classical context. The quantum situation\nis genuinely different. Since all outcomes of a quantum experiment are\nrealized, there is no probability in the usual sense. Nevertheless,\nthis construction explains the illusion of probability. It leads\nbelievers in the MWI to behave according to the following\nprinciple:\n\nBehavior Principle\n\nWe care about all our successive worlds in proportion to their\nmeasures of existence.\n\nWith this principle our behavior should be similar to the behavior of\na believer in the collapse theory who cares about possible future\nworlds in proportion to the probability of their occurrence.\n\nThe important part of the Probability Postulate is the supervenience\nof subjective probability on the measure of existence. Given this\nsupervenience, the proportionality follows naturally from the\nfollowing argument. By the assumption, if after a quantum measurement\nall the worlds have equal measures of existence, the probability of a\nparticular outcome is simply proportional to the number of worlds with\nthis outcome. The measures of existence of worlds are, in general, not\nequal, but the experimenters in all the worlds can perform additional\nspecially tailored auxiliary measurements of some variables such that\nall the new worlds will have equal measures of existence. The\nexperimenters should be completely indifferent to the results of these\nauxiliary measurements: their only purpose is to split the worlds into\n\u201cequal-weight\u201d worlds. Then, the additivity of the measure\nof existence yields the Probability Postulate.\n\nThere are many other arguments (apart from the empirical evidence)\nsupporting the Probability Postulate. Gleason\u2019s 1957 theorem\nabout the uniqueness of the probability measure uses a natural\nprinciple that the probability of an outcome is independent of splitting\ninto parallel worlds. Tappenden 2000, 2017 adopts a different semantics\naccording to which \u201cI\u201d live in all branches and have\n\u201cdistinct experiences\u201d in different\n\u201csuperslices\u201d. He uses \u201cweight of a\nsuperslice\u201d instead of \u201cmeasure of existence\u201d and argues that it\nis intelligible to associate probabilities according to the\nProbability Postulate. Exploiting a variety of ideas in decoherence\ntheory such as the relational theory of tense and theories of identity\nover time, Saunders 1998 argues for the \u201cidentification of\nprobability with the Hilbert Space norm\u201d (which equals the\nmeasure of existence). Page 2003 promotes an approach named\nMindless Sensationalism. The basic concept in this approach\nis a conscious experience. He assigns weights to different\nexperiences depending on the quantum state of the universe, as the\nexpectation values of presently-unknown positive operators\ncorresponding to the experiences (similar to the measures of existence\nof the corresponding worlds). Page writes \u201c\u2026\nexperiences with greater weights exist in some sense more\n\u2026\u201d (2003, 479). In all of these approaches, the postulate is\nintroduced through an analogy with treatments of time, e.g., the\nmeasure of existence of a world is analogous to the duration of a\ntime interval. Note also Greaves 2004 who advocates the\n\u201cBehavior Principle\u201d on the basis of the\ndecision-theoretic reflection principle related to the next\nsection.\n",
