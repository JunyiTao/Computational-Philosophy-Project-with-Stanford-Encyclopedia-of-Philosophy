Metaphysical principles, like the laws of nature,\nmay hold in normal cases, while admitting of occasional exceptions.\nThe principle of causality, for example, that plays a central role in\nthe cosmological argument for God\u2019s existence, can plausibly\nconstrued as a defeasible generalization (Koons 2001).\n\nAs discussed above (in section 1.1), prima facie reasons and defeaters\nof those reasons play a central role in contemporary epistemology, not\nonly in relation to perceptual knowledge, but also in relation to\nevery other source of knowledge: memory, imagination (as an indicator\nof possibility) and testimony, at the very least. In each cases, an\nimpression or appearance provides good but defeasible evidence of a\ncorresponding reality.\n",
