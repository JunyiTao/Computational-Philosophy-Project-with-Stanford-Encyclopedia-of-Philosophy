    "main_text": "Physics || The Wheeler-Feynman Absorber Theory\n4.1 The Wheeler-Feynman Absorber Theory\n\nWhy do we not see any advanced waves in nature? Wheeler and Feynman\n(1945) came up with an answer. If we assume, they said, that radiation\nfrom an isolated accelerated charged particle is equally retarded and\nadvanced, that is half retarded and half advanced to be exact, we can\nexplain why it appears to be fully retarded in terms of the influence\ndistant absorbers make on the source. The absorber consists of charged\nmaterial that reacts with the source field by radiating with half\nretarded and half advanced waves. It is this half advanced field of\nthe charged particles of the absorber which is added to the half\nretarded field of the source. The advanced waves of the absorber\ninterfere constructively with the retarded waves of the source,\nwhereas the same waves cancel out the advanced waves of the source in\na destructive interference. Thus one of the consequences of Wheeler\nand Feynman Absorber Theory is the idea that emitters are\nintrinsically symmetric, another is that there is no intrinsic\ndifference between so-called emitters and so-called absorbers. In\nother words, if this theory is true we have to conclude that radiation\nfrom a source is a time symmetric process but the presence of an\nabsorber makes it asymmetric.\n\nThe Wheeler-Feynman theory takes for granted that outgoing, expanding\nwaves are identical with retarded radiation and incoming, contracting\nwaves with advanced radiation. But is such identification without any\nproblems? Not quite. An example with retarded and advanced emitters\nillustrates clearly why. Think of a stone being thrown directly into\nthe middle of a circular pond. The ripples move outwards from the\npoint where the stone hits the water (the source) in a coherent,\norganized wave front and eventually reach the edges (the absorber).\nMoreover, the source acts earlier than the absorber.\u00a0 What will\nthe inverse process look like? It depends on how we understand such a\nprocess, whether or not we consider a case that includes a reversed\nsource and a reversed absorber. (A) If they are included, the edges of\nthe pond will now act as the source and the converging waves will\neventually reach the middle of the pond. We may create something like\nthis if we dropped a big ring horizontally into the pond. Inside the\nring the waves would move inwards in an organized wave front towards\nthe centre. \u00a0 In this case the source (the drop of the ring)\nwould still act earlier than the absorber (the ripples meeting at the\nmiddle of the pond from all sides). (B) But if our understanding of\nthe inverse process does not include an exchange of the source with\nthe absorber and vice versa, then the ripples reach the edges\nof the pond (the absorber) earlier than the stone plunges into the\nwater (the source). This is definitely not a state of affairs we could\nbring about. Furthermore, if we were to observe such a process, the\nripples would seem to move inwards as contracting waves. The problem\nis that both kinds of inverse processes would seem to appear to us as\norganized incoming waves but one would be a case of retarded radiation\nand the other of advanced radiation.\n\nThis may not be the only problematic assumption of the Wheeler and\nFeynman theory. Huw Price (1996) has singled out other problems. Among\nthem is the question of how we may experience the difference between\nretarded and advanced waves. When Wheeler and Feynman attributed to\nthe source a field of half retarded and half advanced waves, they\nassumed that the field actually consists of retarded as well as an\nadvanced component. Price objects, however, that there is no\nmeasurable difference between the two kinds of waves, and we cannot\njustify such a distinction by an appeal to the nature of the source\nbecause both emitters and absorbers can be associated with retarded as\nwell as advanced waves. Instead he believes that these components are\nfictitious and that Wheeler and Feynman\u2019s formalism merely offer\ntwo different descriptions of the same wave. The problem of the\nasymmetry, as he sees it, has nothing to do with the fact that\ntransmitters are associated with outgoing radiation rather than\nincoming radiation but that transmitters are centered on organized\noutgoing wave fronts whereas receivers are not centered on similar\norganized incoming wave fronts.\n",
