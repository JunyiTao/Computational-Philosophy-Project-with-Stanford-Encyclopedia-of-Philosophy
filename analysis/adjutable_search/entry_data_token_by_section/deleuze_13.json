    "main_text": "The Reception of Deleuze || Deleuze and science\n6.4 Deleuze Effects\n\nAs the interest in Deleuze continues to grow, three of its effects are\nof interest to us, one of which is sociological and the other two of\nwhich are philosophical.\n\nThe sociological effect is the globalization of institutions devoted\nto the study of Deleuze\u2019s thought and its application in various\nfields. A noteworthy institutional initiative is the series of\nconferences sponsored by the journal Deleuze and Guattari\nStudies (see Other Internet Resources) under the leadership of\nIan Buchanan. In addition to numerous conferences in Europe and North\nAmerica, an index of Deleuze\u2019s widespread impact is the success\nof a number of conferences in Asia (to date, Taiwan, India, Singapore,\nSouth Korea, China and Japan).\n\nThe two philosophical effects are that of reviving interest in those\nwhom Deleuze discusses explicitly or those whose influence on Deleuze\ncan be discerned, and that of providing a foil or counterpoint or\nreference point in readings of other philosophers.\n\nThe most prominent example of the revivifying effect is Bergson,\nrelatively forgotten at the time of Deleuze\u2019s\nBergsonism (1966), but now the subject of a growing\nphilosophical literature. Of course, we cannot attribute all this\ninterest to Deleuze\u2019s book and to the subsequent secondary\nliterature on Deleuze that stresses the contribution of Bergson to\nDeleuze\u2019s system (as we ourselves do above on the concept of the\nvirtual and the critique of the possible), but it is not implausible\nto consider the counterfactual whereby without Deleuze\u2019s work\nthe interest in Bergson would not be as strong as it currently is.\nAmong the Bergson commentaries Mullarkey 1999, Guerlac 2006,\nMoulard-Leonard 2009, Grosz 2017, and Lundy 2018 all link the two\nthinkers in their works.\n\nThe post-Kantian Salomon Maimon has been for some time now a subject\nof specialist interest by historians of philosophy; see the entry on\n Maimon;\n see also the recent English translation of his major work [Maimon\n1790 [2010]). Maimon\u2019s relation to Deleuze is explored in Jones\n& Roffe (eds.) 2009, Smith 2010, and Voss 2011.\n\nAnother example of thinker whose current level of interest was\narguably catalyzed by being noticed as an influence on Deleuze is the\nmid-20th century French philosopher Gilbert Simondon, whose notions of\nthe \u201cpre-individual\u201d and of \u201ccrystallization\u201d\nwere influential in the development of Deleuze\u2019s notions of the\nvirtual and actualization, respectively. An English translation of his\nworks is Simondon 2020. Among others, see Toscano 2006 and 2009, Scott\n2014, Sauvagnargues 2016, Swan 2016, Alloa and Michalet 2017, and Voss\n2018 and 2020 for treatments of the Deleuze-Simondon relation.\n\nYet another would be the early 20th century French sociologist Gabriel\nTarde, whose notion of microsociology is referred to approvingly in\nDeleuze and Guattari\u2019s development of their notion of\n\u201cmicropolitics\u201d (Deleuze and Guattari 1980 [1987,\n216\u2013219]). For Deleuze-inspired treatments, see Alliez 2001,\nBrighenti 2010, Read 2015, Tonkonoff 2017.\n\nMore recently and to a still muted extent is the revival of interest\nin mid-20th century French thinker Raymond Ruyer, whose notion of\nsurvol or \u201cself-survey\u201d is mentioned by Deleuze\nand Guattari in their brief remarks on the consistency of the concept\nin its neural instantiation in What is Philosophy? (Deleuze\nand Guattari 1991 [1994, 210]). English translations of Ruyer\u2019s\nworks are Ruyer 2016 and 2018. Ruyer\u2019s relation to Deleuze is\nexplored in Bains 2002, Bogue 2009 and 2017, and Roffe 2017. Other\ntreatments of Ruyer that are relevant would be Massumi 2014 and Grosz\n2017.\n\nFinally, while it\u2019s certainly the case that Whitehead has\ngarnered continuous interest on his own, a good bit of current\nWhitehead scholarship includes reference to Deleuze as a leitmotif, as\nin Stengers 2011. A noteworthy new work influenced by both Deleuze and\nWhitehead is Williams 2016. See also Shaviro 2009, Robinson 2010, and\nBell 2011 and 2012, on the Deleuze and Whitehead connection.\n",
