    "main_text": "Rawls\n6. Rawls\n\n\nThe portrait that we have offered of the standard view (and that of\nits liberal critics) is a composite, one which blends together various\nclaims that its advocates make about the relation between coercive law\nand religious reasons. Because of this approach we have made relatively\nlittle explicit mention of particular advocates of the standard view,\nsuch as that towering figure of contemporary political philosophy, John\nRawls. Of all the contemporary figures who have shaped the debate we\nare considering, however, none has exercised more influence than Rawls.\nIt is natural to wonder, then, whether we've presented the standard\nview in its most powerful form and, thus, whether we've omitted a\ncrucial dimension of the debate between the standard view and its\nliberal critics. We believe not. The version of the standard view that\nwe have considered is one that borrows liberally from Rawls' thought,\nalbeit softened and modified in certain ways. Still, before moving\nforward, it will be helpful to say something more about Rawls' view. We\nlimit ourselves to the following three observations.\n\n\nFirst, Rawls' own position about the relation between coercive law\nand religious reasons has shifted. In Political Liberalism,\nRawls admits that at one point he inclined toward accepting an\nambitious version of the DRR according to which each citizen of a\nliberal democracy ought not to appeal to religious reasons when\ndeliberating about matters of basic justice and constitutional\nessentials (see Rawls 1993, 247 n.36). In the face of criticism, Rawls\nmodified his position, arriving at a close relative of the DRR, viz.,\nthat while an agent may appeal to religious reasons to justify coercive\nlaw, he may not appeal solely to these reasons. Secular reasons must be\nforthcoming (see Rawls 1997).[15]\n\n\nSecond, Rawls places significant restrictions on the content of the\nsecular reasons to which an agent may appeal. To advert to a point made\nearlier, Rawls argues that when deliberating about matters of basic\njustice and constitutional essentials, citizens should appeal to\n\u201cpublic reason,\u201d which (roughly speaking) is a fund of\nshared principles about justice and the common good that is constructed\nfrom the shared political culture of a liberal\ndemocracy\u2014principles that concern, for example, the equality of\ncitizens before the law and their right to a fair system of\ncooperation. In Rawls' view, when deliberating about these matters,\nappealing solely to secular comprehensive accounts of the good such as\nAristotelianism or utilitarianism is no more legitimate than appealing\nsolely to religious reasons. For all of these comprehensive doctrines\nwill be alien to some of one's reasonable compatriots.\n\n\nAs will have been evident, in our presentation of the DRR, we have\nrelaxed Rawls' stipulation, allowing for the legitimacy of appealing to\nonly secular reasons that have their home in one or another\ncomprehensive conception of the good. This might render the DRR\nvulnerable to the criticism that it invidiously and arbitrarily\ndiscriminates against religion.  But the Rawlsian 'public reason'\nalternative is also vulnerable to criticism.  It is not clear, for one\nthing, that the content of public reason will be rich enough to\nprovide compelling reasons to support genuinely informative positions\non matters of basic justice or constitutional essentials. Perhaps, for\nexample, the claims that belong to public reason are only fairly\nsweeping ones that ascribe basic rights of various sorts but offer no\nguidance about how they should be weighed (see Quinn 1997,\n149-52). Furthermore, it is unclear that appealing to public reason is\nthe best way to respect one's fellow citizens. Perhaps, as\nWolterstorff and Stout have argued, respect is better served both by\nexplicitly disclosing to one's interlocutors the reasons one finds\nmost persuasive (whatever they may be) and appealing to reasons that\nthey might most find most persuasive, given their own commitments to\none or another comprehensive perspective (see Wolterstorff 1997 and\nStout 2004, Chs. 2-4).\n\n\nIn fact, Wolterstorff has argued that, ironically, Rawls'\nmethodology has the implication that appealing to public reason would\nbe to treat others with profound disrespect. For note that when Rawls\nformulates his version of public reason, he claims that it will\nincorporate the idea that liberal democracy is a society with a system\nof fair cooperation over time. How do we identify such a system? Rawls\nmaintains that doing so requires that we set off to the side those who\nare \u201cunreasonable\u201d \u2013 these being those who are \u201cunwilling to\nhonor, or even to propose \u2026 fair terms of cooperation\u201d (Rawls\n1993, 51). But, as Wolterstorff contends, there are many who do not\nsatisfy Rawls' account of reasonability, including those who think of\npolitics not in terms of distributive justice but other categories such\nas preserving individual liberty, protecting small government,\nmaximizing their own wealth, and so on. The implication of setting\nthese people off to the side is that, when engaging in public political\ndeliberation about some issue of basic justice, the \u201creasonable\u201d\ncitizens are free to ignore the views of their \u201cunreasonable\u201d\ncompatriots. This, however, raises the concern that far from advocating\na system in which all other citizens are respected as free and equal,\nRawls' view has the paradoxical implication that \u201cto follow the duty of\ncivility is perforce to perpetrate injustice\u201d by Rawls' own lights\n(Wolterstorff 2012, 121).\n\n\nThird, as Paul Weithman points out (in Weithman 2007), there are\nreally two types of argument that Rawls provides in favor of his\nposition. The first is a variant of the argument from respect. More\nspecifically, it is a relative to the first version of the argument\nfrom respect that we considered earlier, which maintains that coercive\nlaws are morally legitimate only if they can be justified to citizens\nof a liberal democracy with their actual commitments and beliefs. This\nargument, if the liberal critics are correct, is subject to some\nfairly powerful replies, among which is that, given the fact that\nthere is widespread pluralism about God and the good among the\ncitizens of liberal democracies, it is impossible for coercive laws\nthat protect basic liberal commitments to be justified to them. The\nsecond type of argument that Rawls provides in favor of his favored\nrestrictions on religious reasons, however, appeals not to the claim\nthat justifying coercion on the basis of alien reasons disrespects our\ncompatriots, but to the idea that the reasons on which we rely must be\nones that others can endorse as autonomous agents. In Kantian\ncategories, this second line of argument singles out not the evil of\nheteronomous considerations, but the goodness of considerations that\nautonomous and reasonable agents could accept as an appropriate basis\nfor settling fundamental political questions.\n\n\nIt is difficult to see, however, that this latter argument genuinely\nmoves beyond the argument from respect. The problem is that it is not\nevident that the content of what Rawls terms public reason is that to\nwhich reasonable and autonomous agents would primarily appeal when\nattempting to settle fundamental political questions. Once again, the\ncontent of public reason may be too thin to settle anything of\nimportance. Moreover, it is unclear that reasonable and autonomous\nagents would regard as inappropriate a democratic system in which\nagents bring to the table whatever reasons that seem best to them and\nvote solely on their basis.\n\n\nImagine, for example, a scenario in which citizens of a liberal\ndemocracy such as ours must deliberate on an issue of basic justice\nsuch as health care reform. One approach these citizens might take is\nRawls': they appeal primarily to public reason. Another approach is\nthat they try to forge a consensus about the issue that incorporates\nfeatures that belong to rather different comprehensive perspectives.\nAccording to this latter approach, Jews, Christians, Kantians,\nBuddhists, and Aristotelians all offer each other the reasons from\ntheir own comprehensive perspectives that seem to support health care\nreform, pointing out to each other the degree to which their reasons\noverlap. No public reasons are offered, only a plethora of\nparticularistic reasons each of which is reasonably rejected by some\ncitizens. Then the matter is put to a vote. Would an agent who is\nreasonable and autonomous reject this procedure in favor of appealing\nto public reason? According to the liberal critics, it is difficult to\nsee why we should believe he would. If so, the connection that Rawls\nattempts to forge between the exercise of autonomy and public reason is\ntoo tight. (In the next section, we discuss a version of\n\u2018public reason liberalism\u2019 that incorporates the basic idea\nthat respect for persons is compatible with each citizen\u2019s\noffering to one non-shared, non-public reasons for state coercion.)\n\n\nA final concern is worth airing. Figures such as Philip Quinn,\nJeffrey Stout, and Nicholas Wolterstorff interpret Rawls as addressing\nthe issue of how citizens in actual liberal democracies ought to\nconduct themselves when debating matters of justice and the common\ngood. But there is evidence that Rawls' texts ought not to be read in\nthis way. For, as Rawls indicates at various places, he takes himself\nto be discussing well-ordered societies. A well-ordered\nsociety is such that it contains no egoists, everyone complies with the\nprinciples of justice, everyone wants to participate in forms of social\nlife that call forth their own and others' natural talents, treachery\nand betrayal are absent, and its members want to cooperate with others\non terms that are mutually justifiable and affirm only reasonable\ncomprehensive doctrines (Weithman 2012, 65, 162, 169, 310). In short, a\nwell-ordered society is nothing like the actual world but is something\napproximating a political Utopia.\n\n\nSuppose Rawls were to establish that in a well-ordered society agents\nwould conform to his favored version of the restrictions on religious\nreasons. This would not imply that, in those circumstances in which we\nactually find ourselves, citizens should appeal to his version,\nthinking of it as a regulatory ideal in their political thinking. Not\nall ideals, after all, are worth pursuing. It might be, for example,\nthat pursuing the Rawlsian ideal would make it much more difficult for\ncitizens to employ other approaches to political deliberation that\nwould result in a liberal democracy being sufficiently stable for the\nright reasons, which, says Rawls, should be a primary objective of any\nliberal democracy. If this were correct, then Rawls's project would\nhave very modest implications for how to think about the relation\nbetween religion and public reason, since it would provide little or\nno guidance for how citizens ought to conduct their behavior (see\nCuneo 2013).\n7. A Convergent Alternative\n\n\nLiberal critics of the standard view have not been free of their own\ncritics. We conclude this part of our discussion by articulating\none important response.\n\n\nAt the heart of the liberal critics\u2019 conception of religion\nand public life is a commitment to parity between the religious and the\nsecular: because there are no morally, sociologically, or epistemically\nrelevant differences between religious and secular reasons, religious\nand secular reasons may play exactly the same role in a citizen\u2019s\ndeliberations or decision-making regarding state coercion. This\nparity claim seems flatly inconsistent with the DRR \u2013 which\nsingles out religious reasons for special, discriminatory\ntreatment. But some theorists have argued that the parity claim,\nwhich is so important to the liberal critics, is in fact consistent\nwith a version of the DRR. An argument of this sort has been\narticulated by Gerald Gaus and Kevin Vallier (Gaus 2012, Gaus and\nVallier, 2009, Vallier, 2014). \n\n\nGaus and Vallier's argument rests on two central claims. First,\nstate coercion is presumptively wrong; each and every coercive state\nenactment must be justified by each and every citizen subject to it. By\ncontrast, the lack of any state policy is not presumptively wrong, and\nso need not be justified \u2013 even to citizens whose well-being is\naffected by the lack of state activity. Second, the reasons by\nwhich state coercion is justified need not be shared by (or be\naccessible to) the citizens who are subject to a given coercive\nmeasure. What matters for purposes of the justification of coercion is\nthat each citizen has sufficient reason, as judged from his or her\nparticular perspective, to endorse state coercion. Since this view\nplaces no restrictions on the reasons to which an agent might appeal,\nreligious and secular reasons can play exactly the same justificatory\nrole, namely, to defeat what would, in the absence of contrary reasons,\nbe permissible acts of state coercion. \n\n\nGaus and Vallier, then, have defended a convergence rather\nthan a consensus account of the standard view. If this\naccount is correct, state coercion must be justifiable to religious\ncitizens as religious believers and when it is not, then state\ncoercion lacks moral legitimacy. The same holds true for non-religious\ncitizens. Although the convergent conception of the standard view\naccords religious reasons a potentially decisive role in defeating\nstate coercion, and so accords religious reasons a much more prominent\nrole in the justification of state coercion than religious reasons have\non most alternative formulations of the standard view, it is also\nconsistent with the DRR. How so? \n\n\nIn any liberal polity, there will inevitably be some secular\ncitizens. If there is nothing to be said from any secular\nperspective that decisively justifies some coercive measure, and if the\nonly plausible rationale for that coercive measure is a religious\nrationale, then there will inevitably be some citizens to whom that\ncoercive measure cannot be justified. According to the view under\nconsideration, such a coercive measure would be disrespectful and so\nillegitimate. So the convergent variation on the standard view\nmaintains the core conviction that religious considerations cannot\ndecisively justify state coercion in pluralistic liberal\npolitics. The implications for the duties of religious citizens\nseem direct: they ought to restrain themselves from supporting any act\nof state coercion that they know cannot be justified other than by\nreligious reasons. That is, they must comply with the DRR. If\nGaus and Vallier are correct, then, commitment to equal treatment of\nreligion is entirely consistent with a version of the DRR. (Gaus and\nVallier, it is worth noting, reject the DRR as an account of the duties\nof citizens, accepting only a milder version that applies to certain\npublic officials in certain circumstances.) \n\n\nAlthough the convergent variation of the standard view will likely\nbe more attractive to liberal critics than familiar alternatives, they\nstill have reason to be skeptical. The convergent conception of the\nstandard view is, after all, demanding: state coercion must pass muster\nbefore the bar of religious and secular reasons. However, many citizens\nwill have compelling reasons to reject core liberal commitments. It\nfollows that, according to the convergence view, those liberal\ncommitments will lack justification. If so, liberal critics have reason\nto reject the convergent view, not because of its implications for\nreligion but for liberalism. Consider in this regard the case of Qtub\ntreated earlier. Qtub seems to have articulated compelling theological\nobjections to the right to religious freedom, and thus articulated\ncompelling theological reasons to deny that the state may coercively\nenforce that right. In this case, the state's enforcement of the right\nto religious freedom seems, according to the convergent conception, to\nlack legitimacy.\n8. The New Traditionalism\n\n\nTo this point, we have been primarily concerned to articulate the\nstandard view and lay out the response offered to it by its liberal\ncritics. We have emphasized that there are important differences\nbetween these two views. While not trivial, these differences should\nnot be exaggerated, however. Both views are deeply committed to the\ncore components of liberal democracy, including the protection of\nbasic freedoms such as the freedom to practice religion as one sees\nfit. Furthermore, both views recognize the legitimacy of religious\nreasons in political deliberation, noting the role of such reasons in\nimportant social movements such as the civil rights movement. The main\ndifference between advocates of the standard view and their liberal\ncritics, we've contended, is how they view the\njustificatory role of these reasons. That said, the liberal\ncritics are not the only or even the most influential critics of the\nstandard view. Indeed, if the central argument of Jeffrey Stout's\nbook Democracy and Tradition is correct, the standard view\nhas generated a worrisome backlash among prominent Christian\ntheologians and political theorists. These theologians and political\ntheorists, who Stout labels the New Traditionalists, reject\nnot only the standard view, but also liberal democracy as\nsuch\u2014their assumption being that the standard view is a more or\nless inevitable outgrowth of liberal democracy. In spite of their\nfairly radical position, Stout contends that these thinkers need to be\ntaken seriously by the friends of democracy, as they exercise\nconsiderable influence in certain sectors of the academy and the\nculture at large.\n\n\n Suppose Stout is right to say that\nNew Traditionalists such as John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and\nStanley Hauerwas are widely influential in the academy and\nelsewhere. Should they be taken seriously by political\nphilosophers? That depends on what one understands the role of\npolitical philosophers to be. Suppose, however, we assume that\npolitical philosophers should be multidisciplinary in orientation,\nengaging with what sociologists, psychologists, and theologians write\nand say. If we assume this, then taking a multidisciplinary\napproach in this case seems to make sense. The topic under\nconsideration, after all, is the relation between religion and\npolitics, and theologians have had much to say about their\ninterrelations. Furthermore, while the approach that the New\nTraditionalists take to our topic is different from that taken by the\nadvocates of the standard view\u2014the New Traditionalists tell a\nhistorical narrative about the ills of liberal democracy\u2014the\nnarrative that they tell is a philosophical one. Indeed, it is a\nnarrative whose main lines will be familiar to most philosophers\nworking in ethics and political philosophy. It is natural to want\nto know whether this historical-philosophical narrative survives\nphilosophical scrutiny. We shall close, then, by considering the\nnarrative that the New Traditionalists tell about the emergence of\nmodern liberal democracies, highlighting the response offered to it by\nthe liberal critics.\n8.1 The Declinist Narrative of the New Traditionalism\n\n\nThose familiar with the work of Alasdair MacIntyre will immediately\nrecognize the New Traditionalists' narrative. For in its broad\nstructure, it bears a close resemblance to the one that MacIntyre tells\nin his three books After Virtue, Whose Justice? Which\nRationality? and Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry\n(MacIntyre 1984, 1988, and 1990,\n respectively).[16]\nThe MacIntyrean\nnarrative is broadly declinist in character, depicting the degeneration\nof Western moral and political thought in the following four\nstages.\n\n\n In the first stage, the New Traditionalists\nmaintain that the late ancient and the high medieval thinkers of the\nwest embraced a unified philosophical vision that includes three\nfundamental components. The first component is a commitment to a\n\u201cthick\u201d teleological account of the human good, according to which\nhuman beings have rational natures that can be perfected. The\nsecond component is a commitment to the claim that virtue consists in\nthe perfection of our rational nature in both its practical and\ntheoretical dimensions. Practical reason, according to the\nvision, can ascertain not merely the means to achieve one's ends, but\nalso the very telos or end for human beings. And theoretical\nreason, so the vision has it, can gain genuine insight into the world\nby viewing the entire created order as participating in or resembling\nthe divine nature. The third component of the vision is that\nmoral thought and discourse should be framed primarily in terms of the\nvirtues\u2014the virtues providing the dominant conceptuality in\nterms of which we conduct moral reasoning. To which it is worth\nadding the following point: advocates of the MacIntyrean narrative do\nnot deny that pre-modern societies had their share of moral, religious,\nand political problems. Their claim is merely that these\nsocieties enjoyed (at least in principle) the shared conceptual\nresources with which they could coherently address and remedy\nthem.\n\n\n In the second stage of the narrative, there\nis a fall into our current fragmented moral and religious\ncondition. Although the New Traditionalists regard different\nmovements and figures as responsible for the fall, they agree on this\nmuch: the philosophical vision that unified the societies of\npre-modernity fell apart. The teleological worldview was replaced\nby a nominalist and mechanistic one. Practical reason became\ninstrumentalized\u2014viewed as merely a \u201cslave of the passions,\u201d to\nuse Hume's phrase. And theoretical reason was conceived of as\nworking in a perfectly adequate fashion apart from any commitment to\nthere being a divinely-ordered reality. Furthermore, the language\nof justice and individual rights supplanted that of virtue. As a\nresult, the state that we now occupy is one in which we no longer enjoy\na shared conception of the good, and politics has become\u2014to use\nMacIntyre's memorable phrase\u2014\u201ccivil war by other means.\u201d\nWithout such a conception of the good, we now face all manner of moral,\nreligious, and political problems that we lack the conceptual resources\nto resolve or even properly understand.\n\n\n In the third stage of the narrative, New\nTraditionalists maintain that liberal democracy emerges as the more or\nless natural political consequence of the fall from the pre-modern\nstate. Liberal democracy, according to the New Traditionalists,\nis not only a political structure that protects putative\nindividual rights (such as to religious freedom), but is also committed\nto a broad thesis of neutrality with respect to notions of God\nand the good. According to this understanding of liberal\ndemocracy, the state should not enact laws that require a religious\nrationale and citizens should therefore comply with the DRR.\nGiven its commitment to neutrality and the DRR, the New Traditionalists\nclaim that liberal democracy is a mode of governance that is\nfundamentally at odds with the type of traditional religious way of\nlife that informed society during its pre-modern state.\n\n\n In the final stage of the narrative, New\nTraditionalists offer proposals of various sorts for how traditionally\nreligious believers should cope with being citizens of a political\nsystem whose fundamental commitments are at odds with their own.\nThe proposals are generally not injunctions to transform the liberal\nstate. Rather, they are broadly separatist in nature, exhorting\ntraditional believers to distance themselves from the liberal state,\nsay, by living in small religious communities, which owe their ultimate\nallegiance to the church or some larger religious tradition. If\nthey are correct, the DRR is both crucial to liberal democracy and an\nimportant reason for traditional believers to reject it.\n8.2 Two concerns about the narrative\n\n\nThe MacIntyrean narrative is intriguing but highly\ncontroversial. Liberal critics have raised the following two\nobjections to it.\n\n\n The first feature of the narrative to which\nliberal critics have drawn attention is its highly intellectualized\ncharacter. If John Milbank and MacIntyre are correct, for\nexample, the fall into secularist liberalism is driven by the influence\nof some fairly abstract philosophical claims about the nature of reason\nand existence, which were defended by the medieval philosopher Duns\nScotus. By rejecting the broadly Augustinian/Thomistic picture of\nreason and existence, the New Traditionalists claim, Scotus paved the\nway for the rise of secularism, which is endemic to contemporary\nliberal democracies (see Milbank 1990 and MacIntyre 1990, Ch.\n7).\n\n\n Liberal critics maintain that, as a matter\nof intellectual history, this is not correct. Proponents of\nbroadly Scotistic or anti-theistic views, according to thinkers such as\nStout, never had the numbers or clout to change the world as\ndramatically as New Traditionalists claim. In fact, if Stout is\ncorrect, there is a counter-narrative to tell that is at least as\nplausible as the one that New Traditionalists champion. According\nto this counter-narrative, we should distinguish two types of\nsecularism: on the one hand, there is secularism as understood by the\nstandard view, which tells us that appeal to religious reasons in\npublic political discourse is insufficient to justify coercive\nlaws. On the other, there is broadly pluralistic secularism,\nwhich tells us merely that participants in public political discourse\nare not in a position to assume that their interlocutors are making the\nsame religious assumptions that they are. Stout maintains that\nliberal democracy is committed only to secularism of the second\nsort. Indeed, even critics of the standard view who affirm\nliberal democracy on religious grounds, such as Wolterstorff, grant\nthat liberal democracy is secular in Stout's second, pluralistic\nsense. Certainly, the liberal critics maintain, there is nothing\nabout liberalism that commits it to a version of secularism in which\nthe liberal state is an anti-Christian ecclesia or an alternate vehicle\nfor salvation, as some New Traditionalists have claimed (see, for\nexample, Milbank, et al. 1999, 192).\n\n\n Suppose that the liberal critics are\ncorrect in their contention that liberal democracy is committed only to\npluralistic secularism. Is this commitment the upshot of a broadly\nScotistic view about reason and existence having taken root in\nmodernity? If thinkers such as Stout and Wolterstorff are\ncorrect, the answer to this question is also: no. Rather, both\nStout and Wolterstorff suggest that liberal democracy's commitment to\nsecularism is the result of Christians themselves recognizing that\npost-Reformation Christianity itself had become so fragmented that\nChristians could no longer appeal to scripture and tradition in public\ndiscourse under the assumption that their interlocutors would share\ntheir views regarding scripture and tradition (see Zagorin\n2003).\n\n\n In support of this contention, Stout\nappeals to the historian Christopher Hill who maintains that in\n17th century English parliamentary politics, one\nincreasingly finds members of parliament appealing rather less to\nscripture when engaging in public political discourse and rather more\nto considerations upon which they and their interlocutors could\nagree. According to this counter-narrative, \u201csecularization was\nnot primarily brought about by the triumph of a secularist\nideology\u2026.What drove the secularization of political discourse\nforward was the increasing need to cope with religious plurality\ndiscursively on a daily basis under circumstances where improved\ntransportation and communication were changing the political and\neconomic landscape\u201d (Stout 2004, 102). To which Stout adds that\nsecularization (in the second, pluralistic sense specified earlier)\nthus understood doesn't morally or pragmatically preclude citizens from\nvoicing their religious convictions in the public square. Martin\nLuther King Jr.'s appeals to religious considerations, for example,\nwere highly politically effective.\n\n\n The first worry regarding the New\nTraditionalists' declinist narrative, then, is that it is overly\nintellectualized, portraying the rise of secularism as owing primarily\nto the influence of philosophical ideas and not to more mundane\nsociological facts, such as the need to cope with increasing religious\npluralism. The second worry about the narrative is that the New\nTraditionalists misdiagnose the character of liberal democracy,\nattributing to its advocates commitments that they needn't\naccept. To better understand this worry, recall the pattern of\nargument that the New Traditionalists employ, which is roughly the\nfollowing:\n\n\nLiberalism is committed to various philosophical claims and\npractices that are incompatible with orthodox theism (or at least\northodox theism in its best forms, such as Thomism).\n\n\nSo, orthodox theists should reject liberalism.\n\n\nWhat are some of the claims and practices that fit poorly with\northodox theism and to which liberalism is committed? If the New\nTraditionalists are correct, at least these two: first, liberalism\ntells us that political systems should be neutral regarding various\nnotions of God and the good; they should not operate with an account of\nan overriding good for human beings in whose light subsidiary goods can\nbe ordered. Second, liberalism is committed to the claim that\nmoral and political discourse should be couched not primarily in terms\nof the virtues, but individual rights. This, say the New\nTraditionalists has rendered liberal democracies a breeding ground for\ncitizens who are individualistic, self-focused, and whose views and\nbehavior are destructive of community. According to the New\nTraditionalists, these two claims are connected. It is because\nliberal democracies do not operate with a thick notion of the good that\nthe language of rights has supplanted that of virtue. For in\norder for the language of the virtues to be intelligible, it must be\ngrounded in a thick account of the good.\n\n\n When properly qualified, liberal critics\nsuch as Stout are willing to grant the first of these claims:\nliberalism does not in fact operate with a thick notion of the\ngood. But they reject the further claim that this has rendered\nappeal to the virtues in a liberal democracy irrelevant or somehow\ndeeply conceptually confused. For consider, Stout argues,\nchampions of liberalism within the broadly pragmatist tradition, such\nas Walt Whitman and John Dewey. These thinkers do not fit well\ninto the MacIntyrean paradigm. At their best, Stout maintains,\nWhitman and Dewey consciously theorize from the perspective of a\nbroadly pragmatic tradition that is committed to the centrality of the\nvirtues, albeit within a society characterized by competing and rival\nconceptions of God and the good.\n\n\n More specifically, Stout maintains that\naccording to pragmatist liberals such as Dewey, good citizens of a\nliberal democracy aspire to express not only civility and respect in\npublic political discourse, but also to accept some measure of\nresponsibility for the conditions of society and the political\narrangements it makes for itself. And to do this, citizens must\nreason with one another about the ethical issues that divide them and\nhold each other responsible, in ways that are decent and fair, for what\nis done and said. If the pragmatist liberals are right, reasoning\nof this sort requires that citizens of liberal democracies display\nvirtues of various sorts, such as openness to the views of others,\nproper respect for their positions, and so forth. In an inversion\nof the MacIntyrean position, Stout contends that it is at least in part\nbecause liberal democracies do not espouse some overarching, thick\nconception of the good that virtues such as civility and respect are\nespecially called for. And, particularly important for our\ndiscussion is Stout's further claim that pragmatism of this variety\nneedn't lend any support to the standard view. Expressing the\nvirtues of civility and respect is perfectly compatible with appealing\nonly to religious considerations when making and supporting political\ndecisions.\n\n\nSo, if the liberal critics are correct, one place to press the New\nTraditionalists' narrative is its claim that only within a thick,\noverarching account of the human good are the virtues\nintelligible. There is, however, a second place to press the\nnarrative, which is its skepticism about rights. As intimated\nearlier, MacIntyre and the New Traditionalists portray individual\nrights claims as both false and dangerous, indeed, as the upshot of an\nEnlightenment conception of morality that is inimical to a properly\nreligious way of life (see MacIntyre 1984 and 1983).\nMacIntyre, for example, writes that not only are rights claims on par\nwith belief in \u201cwitches and unicorns,\u201d but also that:\n\n\nthere is no expression in any ancient or medieval language correctly\ntranslated by our expression \u2018a right\u2019 until near the close of the\nmiddle ages: the concept lacks any means of expression in Hebrew,\nGreek, Latin, or Arabic, classical or medieval, before about 1400, let\nalone in Old English or Japanese even as late as the mid-nineteenth\ncentury. (MacIntyre 1984, 69)\n\n\nIn reply, the liberal critics make two points. First, as a\nmatter of historical fact, it is simply false that rights claims have\ntheir conceptual roots in the soil of late medieval nominalism and\nEnlightenment morality, as MacIntyre claims. Rather, as\nWolterstorff argues, appeals to rights are ubiquitous throughout\nhistory. One can find them, for example, in the ancient Romans\njuridical documents such as Justinian's Digest, the writings\nof the church fathers, and the work of the medieval canon\n lawyers.[17]\nIndeed,\naccording to Wolterstorff, appeals to what we call inherent or natural\nhuman rights can be traced back to the Hebrew and Christian scriptures\n(see Wolterstorff 2008, Pts. I-II). If Wolterstorff is correct,\nthe scriptural tradition not only birthed our conception of inherent\nhuman rights, but also provides the conceptual soil most conducive to\nits survival, for it offers the most cogent account of the worth of\nhuman beings. If this is true, according to Wolterstorff, there\nis no incompatibility between the liberal tradition's reliance on\nrights and a commitment to orthodox theism. To reject liberalism\nbecause it is committed to and relies heavily on the notion of rights\nwould be a mistake.\n\n\nSecond, the liberal critics contend that any connection between the\nappeals to rights in liberalism, on the one hand, and a tendency toward\nindividualism in its citizens, on the other, is highly\ncontingent. Perhaps it is true that contemporary liberal\ndemocracies have in fact had a strong tendency to promote\nindividualism, where this is understood as a person's having a\ndistorted focus on her rights to the exclusion of her\nobligations and responsibilities to others. But if we construe a\nliberal democracy minimally, as a political structure that effectively\nprotects a certain schedule of individual rights (to religious freedom,\nspeech, due process, and the like), it is plausible to suppose that\nexclusive focus on individual rights is itself a betrayal of\nliberalism. After all, claim-rights almost always have\ncorrelative obligations: if you have a right to religious\nfreedom, then I have an obligation not to violate that\nright. Furthermore, I also have an obligation to take feasible\nmeasures to support political institutions that protect that\nright. Any understanding of a liberal democracy according to\nwhich citizens may insist on their rights without due regard for the\nobligations they bear to others and social institutions that protect\nthese rights is arguably both incoherent and a betrayal of basic\nliberal commitments. Thinkers such as Wolterstorff add that for\ntheists who affirm liberal democracy, it is natural to suppose that\ncitizens who ignore their obligations to respect the rights of their\ncompatriots thereby also violate God's rights. For,\naccording to these thinkers, God has a right to be obeyed, and God\ndemands that we respect the worth of each human being. If the\nliberal critics are correct, then, any individualism that attends\nliberal democracy is a corruption. Perhaps it is a corruption to\nwhich liberal democracies are prone; but individualism is neither a\nliberal commitment nor, if thinkers such as Stout and Wolterstorff are\ncorrect, an inevitable manifestation of liberal commitments.\n\n\n The liberal critics, then, are highly\nsuspicious of the New Traditionalists' narrative and the philosophical\nlessons they glean from it. But suppose, for argument's sake,\nthat the narrative is largely compelling. Even if it is\ncompelling, the liberal critics insist that the New Traditionalists\nhave ignored an important option, viz., a minimalist account of liberal\ndemocracy. According to this position, liberalism is committed to\nthe following pair of theses. First, the state is to be neutral\nwith respect to different conceptions of the good. The neutrality\nin question, however, is inclusive in nature. It does not rule\nout the appeal to comprehensive conceptions of the good when making\nfundamental political decisions. Rather, it only rules out the\nclaim that the state is committed to promoting one such\nconception. Second, the state is to protect a schedule of basic\nrights and liberties enjoyed by all its citizens. Its role is to\nensure that its citizens can enjoy such goods as freedom of religion,\nfreedom of conscience, and equality before the law.\n\n\n The liberal critics maintain that a view\nsuch as this deserves serious consideration by both defenders of the\nstandard view and orthodox religious believers. The challenge\nthat liberal critics such as Stout and Wolterstorff pose to New\nTraditionalists in particular is this: Given that moral and religious\npluralism are here to stay, why would Christians and other people of\nfaith want to reject minimal liberal democracy\u2014liberal\ndemocracy shorn of its commitment to the standard view? What\nmorally feasible alternative is there to a political order in which the\nstate employs its coercive powers to protect the rights of each of its\ncitizens?\n\n\n Proponents of the New Traditionalism\nfind this attempt on the part of the liberal critics to marry liberal\ndemocracy with traditional religious belief na\u00efve. If they\nare right, any political system that professes neutrality with respect\nto conceptions of God and the good is unacceptable. At best, it\nwill be inhospitable soil for a genuinely virtuous and religious way of\nlife. At worst, any such system will be an attempt to conceal the\nfact that the deep structure of liberal democracy, with its emphasis on\npersonal freedoms and procedural justice, fits poorly with the thick\naccount of the good that orthodox religious believers endorse.\nAccording to these thinkers, the conflict between liberal democracy and\ntraditional religion runs too deep for appeals to minimalist accounts\nof liberalism to be effective.\n9. Summary\n\n\nThe theologico-political problem is one that concerns the problem of\npolitical authority. In its contemporary form, it primarily\nconcerns the justification of authoritative political acts, such as the\nimplementation of coercive laws. Can religious reasons justify\nthe implementation of such laws? This is the central question\nwith which political philosophers have been concerned. The\nstandard view tells us that religious reasons are never sufficient to\njustify coercive law. It therefore champions the DRR, or the\nclaim that, if a citizen is trying to determine whether or not she\nshould support some coercive law, and if she believes that there is no\nplausible secular rationale for it, then it is impermissible for her to\nsupport that law. The main responses to the standard view divides\ninto two types. Liberal critics of the view hold fast to the\nprinciples of liberal democracy but reject the DRR\u2014in part for\nthe reason that the DRR is illiberal. New Traditionalists, by\ncontrast, reject both liberal democracy itself and the DRR, viewing the\nlatter as more or less a component of the former. (On this latter\npoint, they agree with advocates of the standard view.)\n\n\n Is there likely to be any sort of\nrapprochement between these views? It is difficult to know.\nSometimes, however, positions that occupy the conceptual middle-ground\nin a debate are the best candidates for unifying what can appear to be\nirreconcilable positions. In the case at hand, the liberal\ncritics appear to occupy this conceptual middle-ground, straddling the\nstandard view and the New Traditionalism. On the one hand, the\nliberal critics find themselves sympathetic with the political\ncommitments of the standard view but not with the wariness about\nreligion that often animates this position. On the other hand,\nthe liberal critics find themselves sympathetic with some of the\nreligious commitments embraced by the New Traditionalists but not with\ntheir suspicion of liberal democracy. Nevertheless, the liberal\ncritics are vulnerable to criticisms from both sides. Advocates\nof the standard view will charge that they do not take seriously enough\nthe destructive and divisive effects of religion, hard to quantify as\nthey might be. And friends of the New Traditionalism will\nmaintain that they fail to recognize the corrosive effects of liberal\ndemocracy on traditional religious ways of life. These are\nimportant criticisms, married to passions that deeply divide the\nproponents of these views. Still, members of all parties to the\ndebate agree that the task at hand is to articulate ways in which\ncitizens of a deeply pluralistic liberal democracy can conduct their\nbehavior in manners that are not only faithful to whatever religious\nidentities they may have, but are also just and contribute to the\ncommon good.",
