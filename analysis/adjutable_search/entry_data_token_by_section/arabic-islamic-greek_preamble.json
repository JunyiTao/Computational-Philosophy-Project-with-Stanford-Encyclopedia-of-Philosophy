    "main_text": "\n\nTo some extent, scholars disagree about the role of the Greek sources\nin Arabic and Islamic philosophy (henceforth falsafa, the\nArabic loan word for\n\n\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1).[1]\n While acknowledging the existence of a Greek heritage, those who\nconsider the Qur\u2019an and the Islamic tradition as the main source\nof inspiration for falsafa claim that the latter did not\narise from the encounter of learned Muslims with the Greek\nphilosophical heritage: instead, according to them falsafa\nstemmed from the Qur\u2019anic hikma (\u201cwisdom\u201d).\nAs a consequence, the Greek texts in translation are conceived of as\ninstruments for the philosophers to perform the task of seeking\n wisdom.[2]\n However, most scholars frequently side with the opinion that what\ngave rise to the intellectual tradition of falsafa was the\nso-called movement of translation from\n Greek.[3]\n This entry will not discuss the issue, let alone try to settle it: it\nwill limit itself to present the philosophical Greek sources made\navailable from the beginnings of the translations into Arabic to the\nend of the 10th century. The reason for focusing on the various stages\nof the assimilation of the Greek heritage, instead of taking into\naccount one by one all the works by Plato, Aristotle etc. known to\nArabic\n readers,[4]\n is that it is useful to get an idea of what was translated at\ndifferent times. As a matter of fact, a living interplay took place,\nespecially in the formative period of falsafa, between the\ndoctrines of the philosophers writing in Arabic and the Greek sources\nmade available. Of momentous importance for the development of\nfalsafa was the simultaneous translation of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics and De Caelo, some writings by Alexander\nof Aphrodisias (most of them of a cosmological nature),\nPlotinus\u2019 Enneads IV\u2013VI, and Elements of\nTheology by Proclus. Al-Kindi, the first faylasuf,\ninitiated the incorporation of the Aristotelian, Peripatetic and\nNeoplatonic doctrines; at the same time, he reproduced them in his\nphilosophical works. Later on, the knowledge of the complete\nAristotelian corpus provided by another generation of translators,\nwithout altering substantially this picture, produced a different\napproach. The Aristotelian science as a systematic whole, ruled by\ndemonstration and made available together with Euclid, Ptolemy,\nHippocrates and Galen, paved the way for al-Farabi to build up the\nproject of a curriculum of higher education, which was meant to\nsubsume the native Islamic sciences in the broader system of the\nliberal arts and philosophical sciences. Both the cross-pollination of\nthe Aristotelian and Neoplatonic traditions of the Kindian age, and\nthe rise of a complete system of rational sciences in the light of\nFarabi\u2019s educational syllabus of the philosopher-king, lie in\nthe background of Avicenna\u2019s program to provide the\nsumma of demonstrative science\u2014from logic to\nphilosophical theology\u2014as a necessary step for the soul to\nreturn to its origin, the intelligible realm (Endress 2006). When\nAverroes, two centuries after the end of the age of the translations,\nresumed the project of building up the demonstrative science as a\nsystematic whole, he had recourse to the Greek sources in Arabic\ntranslation which were available in the Muslim West, mostly Aristotle\nand his\n commentators.[5]\n",
