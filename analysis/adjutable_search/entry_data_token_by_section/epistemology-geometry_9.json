    "main_text": "Riemannian geometry\n5. Riemannian geometry\n\nThe much more significant change came with the arrival of Bernhard\nRiemann\u2019s great extension of Gaussian differential geometry.\nPrecisely, he found a way to define geometries starting from very\ngeneral concepts, and gradually leading (through more and more narrow\nhypotheses) to the known metric geometries. At the risk of sounding\nanachronistic, it can be argued that Riemann\u2019s\n\u201cconceptual\u201d style of work is a form of\nproto-structuralism. What he does is this: first, he introduces the\ngeneral structure of n-dimensional manifold, to then define a metric\nin the manifold (with the means of differential geometry, line element\nand Gaussian curvature). With all this in place, Euclidean and\nnon-Euclidean geometries emerge as particular cases of 3-dimensional\nmanifolds, concrete forms of the general structure. And the\n\u201chypothesis\u201d that singles out these geometries, within the\ngeneral framework of Riemannian manifolds, is the physical assumption\nthat rigid bodies can move freely without deformation.\n\nSome of the epistemological issues are already raised with\nGauss\u2019s work (1828), so we turn to it first. Euler had shown\nlong before that, at each point P in a (smooth) surface, there\nare two so-called principal curvatures, the maximum and the\nminimum curvature of lines passing through P. These curvatures,\n\\(\\kappa_{1}\\) and \\(\\kappa_{2}\\), occur in plane sections\nperpendicular to each other and allow us to study the shape of the\nentire neighborhood of P. Now, Gauss\u2019s deep idea (which remarkably he\nfound while working on geodesy, i.e., surveying and mapmaking) was\nthat some properties of curved surfaces can be studied without regard\nfor the ambient space. And one of these key properties is the product\n\\(\\kappa_{1}\\kappa_{2}\\), called the Gaussian curvature of the surface\n(at a point). Thus, employing methods of differential analysis, he\nelaborated what is called an intrinsic geometry of surfaces. \n Gauss worked with coordinate systems within the surface\nitself, and considered the distance between points on the surface S\nalong lines contained entirely in S. Now, some surfaces\n\\(S_1\\), \\(S_2\\) can be obtained from each other by bending (without\nstretching); expressed more formally, there is an isometric map\nfrom \\(S_1\\) to \\(S_2\\), which means that the points on\n\\(S_1\\) are assigned points in \\(S_2\\) so that distances within the\nsurface \\(S_1\\) are the same as the distances of the corresponding\npoints in \\(S_2\\). (For instance, a plane can be so bent to form of\ncylinder; you may use a piece of paper to convince yourself.)  And\nGauss made the remarkable discovery that the Gaussian curvature of a\nsurface is an intrinsic property that remains invariant under\nisometric mappings. He was so happy about this result that he called\nit theorema eggregium, his \u2018outstanding theorem\u2019:\nif two surfaces \\(S_1\\), \\(S_2\\) are isometric, then corresponding\npoints have the same Gaussian curvature. \n\nThe fact that the Gaussian curvature of a surface at a point is\nintrinsic means that it is entirely determined by measurements\nin the surface and does not involve any question of a third\ndimension or the ambient space embedding the surface. The property of\nGaussian curvature does not depend on how the surface is located in\nspace, but only on intrinsic properties of its metrics. That is to\nsay, important properties of curved surfaces remain invariant even if\none bends the surface isometrically (without breaking, stretching, or\nfolding it up). One such thing that remains invariant is the\ngeodesics on the surface, i.e., the lines of shortest distance\n(lying entirely on the surface). In the case of a cylinder, the\ngeodesics are the vertical lines, horizontal lines (circles), and\nhelices around it \u2014and these lines all come from straight lines\non the plane that is \u2018rolled up\u2019 to form the cylinder. \n\nGiven a metric, a differential formula for the distance ds\nbetween neighboring points (which is everywhere the same), the\ncurvature can be found. If, for example, the formula for distance is\nthat for a map of the sphere on the plane, the curvature will be found\nto be the reciprocal of the square of the radius of the sphere\n\\(1/R^2\\). A plane has the same Gaussian curvature as a cylinder, or\nalso as something close to a cone (that one may form from a cylinder,\nwithout breaking, stretching, or folding); they are locally isometric;\nalthough curved, the cylinder has zero curvature in Gauss\u2019s\ntechnical sense, just as does the plane, which is why printing from a\nrotating drum is possible. Gauss investigated when one surface can be\nmapped onto another in such a way that distances are not altered,\nshowing that a necessary condition for this to happen is that the\ncurvatures at corresponding points are the same. And this also implies\nthat the same figures can be constructed on all of these surfaces; the\nminimal lines or\u00a0curves of shortest length between two points\n(geodesics) on one surface correspond to those on the others, so that\nangles, areas, etc. will be the same. Gauss had found a deeper way to\nlook into the geometry of a surface, and this gave birth to modern\ndifferential geometry.\n\nIt was not immediately appreciated that Gauss\u2019s approach allowed\nmathematicians to define surfaces as regions of the plane with a\nparticular metric that are not to be obtained from surfaces in\nEuclidean 3-dimensional space. If one defines a surface as\nthe image of a map from a piece of \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) to\n\\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), then of course it is in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). But if one\ndefines a surface as a region of \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) with a particular\nmetric, then there may be no surface in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) to which it\ncorresponds. The first person to appreciate this seems to have been\nRiemann, who also extended this idea to any number of dimensions.\n",
