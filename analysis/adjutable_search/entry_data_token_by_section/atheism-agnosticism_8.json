    "main_text": "Two Arguments for Local Atheism || The Decisive Evidence Argument\n7. An Argument against Agnosticism\n\nThe topic in\n section 4\n was Le Poidevin\u2019s argument for the truth of a modest form of\nagnosticism. In this section, an argument for the falsity of a more\nambitious form of agnosticism will be examined. Because the sort of\nagnosticism addressed in this section is more ambitious than the sort\ndefended by Le Poidevin, it is conceivable that both arguments succeed\nin establishing their conclusions.\n\nIn Le Poidevin\u2019s argument, the term \u201cagnosticism\u201d\nrefers to the position that neither versatile theism nor global\natheism is known to be true. In this section,\n\u201cagnosticism\u201d refers to the position that neither the\nbelief that omni-theism is true nor the belief that it is false is\nrationally permissible. This form of agnosticism is more ambitious\nbecause knowledge is stronger (in the logical sense) than rational\npermissibility: it can be rationally permissible to believe\npropositions that are not known to be true, but a proposition cannot\nbe known to be true by someone who is not rationally permitted to\nbelieve it. Thus, an appropriate name for this form of agnosticism is\n\u201cstrong agnosticism\u201d.\n\nAnother difference concerns the object of the two forms of\nagnosticism. The agnosticism in Le Poidevin\u2019s argument concerned\nversatile theism versus global atheism. In this section, the target is\nomni-theism versus the local atheistic position that omni-theism is\nfalse. The previous section focused on two arguments for the\nconclusion that this form of local atheism is very probably true. In\nthis section, the question is whether or not that conclusion, if\nestablished, could ground a successful argument against strong\nagnosticism.\n\nSuch an argument can be formulated as follows:\n\n\n(1)Atheism\n(understood here as the denial of omni-theism) is very probably\ntrue.\n\n\n(2)If atheism\nis very probably true, then atheistic belief is rationally\npermissible.\n It follows from (1) and (2) that\n\n\n(3)Atheistic\nbelief is rationally permissible.\n\n\n(4)If strong\nagnosticism (about omni-theism) is true (that is, if withholding\njudgment about the truth or falsity of omni-theism is rationally\nrequired), then atheistic belief is not rationally\npermissible.\n It follows from (3) and (4) that\n\n\n(5)Strong\nagnosticism (about omni-theism) is false.\n\n\n\nPremise (1)\n was defended in\n section 6,\n premise (4) is true by the definition of \u201cstrong\nagnosticism\u201d, and steps\n (3)\n and\n (5)\n follow from earlier steps by modus ponens and modus\ntollens, respectively. This leaves premise\n (2),\n the premise that, if atheism is very probably true, then atheistic\nbelief is rationally permissible.\n\nOne might attempt to defend this premise by claiming that the\nprobabilities in\n premise (2)\n are rational credences and hence the truth of the so-called Lockean\nthesis (Foley 1992) justifies (2):\n\n\nIt is rational for a person S to believe a proposition\nP if and only if it is rational for S\u2019s\ncredence in P to be sufficiently high to make\nS\u2019s attitude towards P one of belief.\n\n\nThe Lockean thesis, however, is itself in need of justification.\nFortunately, though, nothing so strong as the Lockean thesis is needed\nto defend\n premise (2).\n For one thing, all the defender of (2) needs is an \u201cif\u201d,\nnot an \u201cif and only if\u201d. Also, the defender of (2) need\nnot equate, as the Lockean thesis does, the attitude of belief with\nhaving a high credence. Thus, all that is required is the following\nmore modest thesis (call it \u201cT\u201d):\n\n(T) If it is rationally\npermissible for S\u2019s credence in a proposition\nP to be (very) high, then it is rationally permissible for\nS to believe P. \n\n\nEven this more modest thesis, however, is controversial, because\nadopting it commits one to the position that rational (i.e.,\nrationally permissible) belief is not closed under conjunction. In\nother words, it commits one to the position that it is possible for\neach of a number of beliefs to be rational even though the additional\nbelief that those beliefs are all true is not rational.\n\nTo see why this is so, imagine that a million lottery tickets have\nbeen sold. Each player purchased only a single ticket, and exactly one\nof the players is certain to win. Now imagine further that an informed\nobserver has a distinct belief about each of the million individual\nplayers that that particular player will lose. According to thesis\nT, each of those million beliefs is rational. For example, if\nSue is one of the players, then according to T the\nobserver\u2019s belief that Sue will lose is rational because it is\nrational for the observer to have a (very) high credence in the\nproposition that Sue will lose. Since, however, it is certain that\nsomeone will win, it is also rational for the observer to believe that\nsome player will win. It is not rational, however, to have\ncontradictory beliefs, so it is not rational for the observer to\nbelieve that no player will win. This implies, however, that rational\nbelief is not closed under conjunction, for the proposition that no\nplayer will win just is the conjunction of all of the propositions\nthat say of some individual player that they will lose.\n\nDefenders of\n premise (2)\n will claim, very plausibly, that the implication of T that\nrational belief is not closed under conjunction is completely\ninnocuous. Isn\u2019t it obvious, for example, that it would not be\nrational for a fallible human being to believe that all of their many\nbeliefs are true, even if each of those beliefs were rational? Others\n(e.g., Oppy 1994: 151), however, regard the conclusion that rational\nbelief is not closed under conjunction as unacceptable and will for\nthat reason reject premise (2). So even if it can be shown that\nomni-theism is very probably false, it still won\u2019t be obvious to\neveryone that it is rationally permissible to be a local atheist about\nomni-theism and thus it still won\u2019t be obvious to everyone that\nstrong agnosticism about omni-theism is false.\n",
