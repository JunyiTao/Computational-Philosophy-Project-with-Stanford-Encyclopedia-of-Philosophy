    "main_text": "Reading the contemporary\u2014evolving themes || Critical ethnophilosophy\n7.2 Critical ethnophilosophy\n\nThe notion of ethnophilosophy arose in the context of debates about\nAfrican philosophy\u2019s proper content and methods, and was most\ncommonly deployed, most prominently by Paulin Hountondji, \u201cas a\nkind of negative characterization of \u2026 the traditionalist\napproach to African philosophy\u201d (Wiredu 2004, 3). Hallen\ndescribes the worrisome version of this approach:\n\n\nEthnophilosophy presents itself as a philosophy of peoples rather than\nof individuals; in African societies one is therefore given the\nimpression that there can be no equivalent to a Socrates or to a Zeno.\nEthnophilosophy speaks only of Bantu philosophy, Dogon philosophy,\nYoruba philosophy\u2026 . Ethnophilosophy\u2019s sources are in the\npast, in what is described as authentic, traditional African \u2026\nprior to \u2018\u2018modernity.\u2019\u2019 These are to be found\nprimarily in products of language: parables, proverbs, poetry, songs,\nmyths\u2026 . [E]thnophilosophy therefore tends to portray African\nbeliefs as things \u2026 that are somehow timeless \u2026 placing\nminimal emphasis upon the rigorous argumentation and criticism that\nare prerequisites to the \u2026 search for truth. (Hallen 2004,\n122)\n\n\nI refer to this as the worrisome version of traditionalism because\nHountondji and others have made room for the possibility of a less\nworrisome, more critical form of traditionalism. Paget Henry, for\nexample, has reclaimed the notion of ethnophilosophy to denote an\nhistorically and culturally rooted corrective to overly abstract\naccounts of the unity of Africana philosophy. He puts it this way:\n\u201cIn spite of the controversy that has raged over the practice of\nethnophilosophy, I think it is a necessary component \u2026 of all\nAfricana-oriented philosophies\u201d (Henry 2000, 154).\n\nHenry here joins Appiah (1993) in calling for a kind of\ncritical ethnophilosophy, which excavates the insights of\nAfricana cultures and makes them philosophically cognizable without\ninsulating them from critical scrutiny or freezing them in the\nprecolonial\n amber.[10]\n The prospect of this sort of work continues to draw attention and\ninspire researchers. One of the clearest examples of this, apart from\nHenry\u2019s approach to Afro-Caribbean philosophy, is in the growing\nliterature seeking to bring specifically African philosophical\nconcepts into contemporary debates in ethics and political philosophy.\nThe notion of ubuntu is probably the most frequent and prominent\nrecipient of this treatment, in ways that have generated considerable\ncontroversy (to which we will return). But there are many other\nexamples. Consider, for example, Mbih Jerome Tosam\u2019s (2014)\nstudy of the philosophical underpinnings of Kom proverbs or Adebola B.\nEkanola\u2019s (2017) examination of the Yor\u00f9b\u00e1\nconception of peace. Outside of the continent, and alongside\nHenry\u2019s redeployment of traditionalism, one finds a growing\nnumber of pieces like Lindsey Stewart\u2019s (2017) study of Hoodoo\nlove rituals as models for the practice of freedom.\n\nAn important set of debates in critical ethnophilosophy grew up around\nthe study of ubuntu in South Africa, and around the role of white\nphilosophers in this work. Thaddeus Metz (2007) and Mogobe Ramose\n(2015) have been perhaps the clearest spokespersons for the positions\nthat, for current purposes, are the keys to the\n debate.[11]\n On one side are scholars who aim to treat the concept of ubuntu as\nanother resource for the work of ethics and political philosophy, and\nwho regard this approach as an expression of respect for indigenous\nAfrican resources. On the other side are scholars for whom the sudden\n\u201cmainstreaming\u201d of African concepts is extremely\nsuspicious, often for reasons very much like the ones that motivate\nworries about the misappropriation of cultural practices related to\naesthetic experience. A short, gentle version of the worry might go\nlike this: In a majority black country with a majority white\nphilosophy professoriate, a country in which the professoriate assumed\nits shape over time not by dint of natural forces or by accident but\nthanks to the careful hoarding of resources and opportunities along\nracial lines, it is unseemly and perhaps blameworthy for white\nphilosophers to start mining resources from African cultures without\nfirst transforming its institutional structures to grant substantive\naccess to people from those cultures (and, Ramose [2015] points out,\noften without learning the relevant languages the way they would learn\nGreek to study the Stoics in earnest). There are of course ways to\ndevelop this worry and ways to respond to it; the point right now is\nsimply to mark debates around it as an example of an area of recent\ninterest in and around Africana philosophy.\n",
