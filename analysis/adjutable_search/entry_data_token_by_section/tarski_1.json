    "main_text": "Truth\n2. Truth\n\nIn a logic seminar he gave at the University of Warsaw between 1927\nand 1929, Tarski proved several results that made reference to notions\nthat later would be called \u201csemantical\u201d, in particular\nresults about the notions of definability and of truth in a structure\n(see Vaught 1974 and 1986). Vaught informs us that Tarski found\ncertain difficulties when trying to give a mathematically satisfactory\nform to the results presented in the seminar, and that this led him to\nlook for a precise theory of the semantical notions (cf. Vaught 1974,\npp. 160ff. and 1986, pp. 870ff.). Such a theory did not exist at the\ntime. In particular, there were no definitions of these notions in\nterms of concepts accepted in the foundational systems designed for\nthe reconstruction of classical mathematics (for example, Russell and\nWhitehead\u2019s theory of types or Zermelo\u2019s set theory).\nBecause of this, the existing results in which these notions appeared\ncould not be reconstructed in the accepted foundational systems. And\nthere was no rigorous axiomatic theory of the semantical notions in\nwhich these were taken as primitive, either.\n\nIn spite of this, the results about semantical notions were important\nand even moderately abundant by 1930. Among these Tarski himself would\nmention G\u00f6del\u2019s completeness theorem and several versions\nof the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem (cf. Tarski 1983b, pp.\n240\u20131, sp. p. 240 n.1, and p. 241 n. 2). All these results use\nthe notion of truth in a structure, or functionally equivalent\nnotions. And Tarski says that\n\nit is evident that all these results only receive a clear content and\ncan only then be exactly proved, if a concrete and precisely\nformulated definition of [true] sentence is accepted as a basis for\nthe investigation (Tarski 1983b, p. 241).\n\n\nTarski\u2019s aim in a series of works on semantical notions was\nprecisely to propose mathematically acceptable definitions of those\nnotions, and in particular acceptable in some one of the chief\nfoundational systems (the system chosen by Tarski will change with\ntime; see below). With appropriate definitions of those notions, the\ntheorems about them would be susceptible of being reformulated making\nuse of the defined notions, and the uneasiness described by Tarski in\nthe text just quoted would be alleviated. The alternative of taking\nthe semantical notions as primitive is also considered by Tarski in\nseveral places, but he clearly prefers to avoid it if possible. The\nreason is that in the axiomatic alternative there is no negligible\nrisk that there remain ways of generating the semantical antinomies\nfor the semantical primitives of the system (cf. Tarski 1983b, p.\n255). With the definitional procedure, however, the consistency of the\ndefinition would depend exclusively on the consistency of the theory\nin which it is formulated, and this will be a theory we have reasons\nto think is consistent.\n\nThe first work containing a mathematical definition of one of the\nsemantical notions is Tarski (1931) (English version, Tarski 1983d),\nwhere Tarski examines a language L in which it is possible to\nformalize the arithmetic of the real numbers, and gives a recursive\ndefinition of the notion \u201cset of real numbers definable in\nL\u201d (cf. Def. 9 in Tarski 1983d, p. 128). The definition\ndepends on others that are a bit cumbersome; today we would define a\nsimilar notion in a simpler way with the help of the definition of\ntruth that Tarski himself would publish two years later. But the\nessence of the Tarskian definition of truth is already here. In the\n1931 paper we find also, as was to be expected, the Tarskian concern\nwith matters of precision and foundational rigor, and a revealing\nstatement about the attitude of mathematicians toward the notion of\ndefinability, that could be extended to other semantical notions:\n\nThe distrust of mathematicians towards the notion in question is\nreinforced by the current opinion that this notion is outside the\nproper limits of mathematics altogether. The problems of making its\nmeaning more precise, of removing the confusions and misunderstandings\nconnected with it, and of establishing its fundamental properties\nbelong to another branch of science\u2014metamathematics (Tarski\n1983d, p. 110).\n\n\nIn his classic monograph on the concept of truth \u201cThe Concept of\nTruth in Formalized Languages\u201d (Polish original version, Tarski\n1933; German translation with an added postscript, Tarski 1935;\nEnglish version of the German text, Tarski 1983b), Tarski will present\na method for constructing definitions of truth for classical\nquantificational formal languages. When one succeeds in applying this\nmethod to a particular formal language, the end result will be the\nconstruction of a predicate in a metalanguage for that language whose\nessential properties will be that it will be constructed out of\nnon-suspicious mathematical vocabulary and that it will be intuitively\nsatisfied precisely by the intuitively true sentences of the object\nlanguage. At the same time, Tarski shows how, in terms of the defined\nnotion of truth, one can give intuitively adequate definitions of the\nsemantical notions of definability and denotation, and he indicates\nhow it is possible to define the notion of truth in a structure in a\nway analogous to the one used to define\n truth.[1]\n That allows him to conclude that the acceptability and rigor of the\n\u201crecent methodological studies\u201d (of L\u00f6wenheim,\nSkolem, G\u00f6del and Tarski himself, among others), have been\nvindicated (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 266).\n\nLanguages, both object languages and metalanguages, are in the\nmonograph not just interpreted grammars; a language also includes a\ndeductive system. A Tarskian metalanguage always includes its object\nlanguage as a part, both its grammar (perhaps under some translation)\nand its deductive system. And besides, it will always contain a few\nmore things if these things are not already in the object language.\nSpecifically, it will always contain a sub-language and sub-theory\nthat can be used to say a great deal of things about the syntax of the\nobject language; and it will always contain all the mathematics (both\nconcepts and methods of proof) that \u201cmay be taken from any\nsufficiently developed system of mathematical logic\u201d (Tarski\n1983b, p. 211).\n\nTarski doesn\u2019t give a general formulation of his method. Such a\ngeneral formulation would not be too illuminating. Instead he\nhelpfully chooses to illustrate his method as it would work for a few\nlanguages. The most basic example he uses, to which about half of his\nmonograph is devoted, is what he calls \u201cthe language of the\ncalculus of classes\u201d (LCC). Here is a quick description in more\ncurrent notation (Tarski uses \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s Polish\nnotation):\n\nprimitive signs of LCC: \u2200, \u2228, \u00ac, (, ), I (a binary\npredicate), x, \u2032 (a subindex\naccent to generate variables by suffixing to \u201cx\u201d;\nlet\u2019s use the notation xn for the\nx followed by n accents).\ngrammar of LCC: Atomic formulae are of the form\nIxkxl.\nComplex formulae are obtained by negation, disjunction and universal\nquantification.\ninterpretation of LCC: The range of the variables is the class of\nall subclasses of individuals (of the universe). I stands for the\nrelation of inclusion among these subclasses. The other signs mean\nwhat you would expect.\n\n\nBesides all this, Tarski gives a deductive system for LCC, as required\nof every language.\n\nTarski\u2019s most basic idea about how to construct a truth\npredicate, a predicate which will be intuitively satisfied exactly by\nthe intuitively true sentences of LCC, is that such a predicate should\nverify what he calls \u201cconvention T\u201d. This\nconvention imposes a condition on defined truth predicates ((a) in the\nexample immediately below) that Tarski often talks about as grasping\nthe intuitions behind the \u201cclassical Aristotelian conception of\ntruth\u201d (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 155; 1944, pp. 342\u20133).\nConvention T is here spelled out for the case of\nLCC:\n\n\nConvention T. A formally correct definition of the\nsymbol \u201cTr\u201d, formulated in the metalanguage, will be\ncalled an adequate definition of truth if the deductive\nsystem of the metatheory proves the following:\n\nall sentences which are obtained from the expression\n\u201cTr(x) if and only if p\u201d by substituting\nfor the symbol \u201cx\u201d a structural-descriptive name\nof any sentence of the language in question and for the symbol\n\u201cp\u201d the expression which forms the translation of\nthis sentence into the metalanguage;\nthe sentence \u201cfor any x, if Tr(x) then\nx is a sentence of LCC\u201d (cf. Tarski 1983b, pp.\n187\u20138).\n\n\n\nThat a definition is \u201cformally correct\u201d means, roughly,\nthat it will be constructed out of non-suspicious vocabulary following\nnon-controversial rules for defining new expressions. But why should\none think that a predicate verifying convention T\nshould be, besides, coextensional with the intuitive predicate of\ntruth for LCC? The reason can be given by an intuitive argument\nrelating both predicates, such as the following (cf. Tarski 1944, pp.\n353\u20134):\n\n\n(\u21d2) Suppose that \u201cp\u201d is a sentence of LCC\nsuch that Tr(\u201cp\u201d). By assumption,\n\u201cTr(\u201dp\u201c) if and only if p\u201d\nis provable in the metalanguage. So Tr(\u201cp\u201d) if\nand only if p (the metalanguage must only prove truths). So\np. So \u201cp\u201d is true.\n\n(\u21d0) Suppose that \u201cp\u201d is true. Then\np. And then, as before, Tr(\u201cp\u201d).\n\n\nTarski defines truth in terms of the notion of the satisfaction of a\nformula of LCC by an infinite sequence of assignments (of appropriate\nobjects: subclasses of the universe of individuals in the case of\nLCC). He gives first a recursive definition and immediately indicates\nhow to transform it into a normal or explicit definition. The\nrecursive definition is this: an infinite sequence of classes\nf satisfies formula F if and only if f and\nF are such that\n\nthere are natural numbers k and l such that\nF =\nIxkxl and\nf(k)\u2286f(l); or \nthere is a formula G such that F=\u00acG\nand f does not satisfy G; or \nthere are formulae G and H such that\nF=(G\u2228H) and f satisfies\nG or f satisfies H; or finally,\nthere is a natural number k and a formula G such\nthat F=\u2200xkG and\nevery infinite sequence of subclasses that differs from f at\nmost in the kth place satisfies G (cf. Tarski 1983b,\np. 193).\n\n\nThe normal definition is this:\n\n\nAn infinite sequence of subclasses f satisfies a formula\nF if and only if f and F stand in every\nrelation R among sequences and formulae such that, for any\ng and G, g and G stand in\nR if and only if g is an infinite sequence of\nsubclasses, F is a formula and either\n\nthere are natural numbers k and l such that\nG =\nIxkxl and\ng(k)\u2286g(l); or\nthere is a formula H such that G is\n\u00acH and g and H don\u2019t stand in\nR; or\nthere are formulae H and I such that G\nis (H\u2228I) and g and H stand in\nR or g and I stand in R; or\nthere is a natural number k and a formula H such\nthat G is \u2200xkH\nand, for every infinite sequence of subclasses h that differs\nfrom g at most in the kth place, h and\nH stand in R (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 193, n. 1).\n\n\n\nTarski then defines the truth predicate as follows:\n\nFor all x, Tr(x) if and only if x is a\nsentence of LCC and every infinite sequence of subclasses satisfies\nx (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 195).\n\n\nGiven the way the definition has been constructed, it is intuitively\nclear that the metalanguage will prove all biconditionals of the\nconvention T for LCC. Tarski does not prove this\ncumbersome fact in a metametalanguage, and he helpfully contents\nhimself with showing how a few of the biconditionals would be\nestablished in the metalanguage.\n\nThe usual reasonings leading to the semantical antinomies cannot be\nreproduced for the Tarskian defined semantical concepts. In\nparticular, the antinomy of the liar cannot be reproduced using the\ndefined predicate Tr. Consider the version of the antinomy offered by\nTarski (due to \u0141ukasiewicz). Abbreviate the expression \u201cthe\nfirst underlined sentence of this entry\u201d with the letter\n\u201cc\u201d. Now consider the sentence:\n\nc is not a true sentence.\n\n\nGiven what \u201cc\u201d abbreviates, we get\n\n(a) \u201cc is not a true sentence\u201d = c\n\n\nAnd the following is intuitively true:\n\n(b) \u201cc is not a true sentence\u201d is a true sentence\nif and only if c is not a true sentence.\n\n\nFrom (a) and (b) follows the contradiction\n\nc is a true sentence if and only if c is not a true\nsentence.\n\n\nThe reason why this cannot be reproduced for Tr is that this predicate\nis always a predicate of a language (the metalanguage) different from\nthe language of the sentences to which it applies (the object\nlanguage). It is not possible to form a sentence of the language for\nwhich one defines Tr that says of itself that it is (not) Tr, since Tr\nis not a predicate of that language. On the other hand, it is\ncertainly possible in some cases to form a sentence S of the\nmetalanguage that says of itself that it is not Tr, but since\nS is a sentence of the metalanguage it is simply true and\n(presumably) not paradoxical, since there is no reason why a\nbiconditional like (b) should hold for it; biconditionals of this kind\nhold only for sentences of the language for which Tr has been defined,\nnot for sentences of the metalanguage.\n\nLCC has the property of being what Tarski calls a \u201clanguage of\nfinite order\u201d. The idea of order is familiar. Variables for\nindividuals (non-existent in LCC) are of order 1. Variables for\nclasses of individuals (all the variables of LCC) are of order 2.\nVariables for classes of classes of individuals are of order 3, and so\non. The order of a language of this series is the greatest positive\ninteger n with variables of order n. (Thus, although\nLCC looks grammatically just like a first-order language, semantically\nit can be seen as a fragment of what under present conventions would\nbe called a second-order language.)\n\nBut there are also languages of infinite order. In these the order of\nthe available variables is not bounded above. Tarski gives an example,\nwhich he calls \u201cthe language of the general theory of\nclasses\u201d (LGTC). Here again is a quick description in more\ncurrent notation:\n\nprimitive signs of LGTC: \u2200, \u2228, \u00ac, (, ), X,\n\u2032, \u2032 (The last two are a subindex\naccent and a superindex accent to generate variables by suffixing to\n\u201cX\u201d; let\u2019s use the notation\nXnm for the\nX followed by n subindex accents and m\nsuperindex accents. The superindex must be positive.)\ngrammar of LGTC: Atomic formulae are of the form\nXnm+1Xpm.\nComplex formulae are obtained by negation, disjunction and universal\nquantification with respect to the variables of all orders.\ninterpretation of LGTC: A variable of the form\nXn1 takes as values\nindividuals, a variable of the form\nXn2 takes as values classes of\nindividuals, a variable of the form\nXn3 takes as values classes of\nclasses of individuals, etc.\nXnm+1Xpm\n\u201cmeans\u201d that the object assigned to\nXnm+1\n\u201ccontains\u201d the object assigned to\nXpm. The other signs\nmean what you would expect.\n\n\nBesides all this, Tarski gives a deductive system for LGTC, as\nrequired of every language. Suffice it to say that it is a version of\na typical simple theory of finite types, with axioms and rules for the\nconnectives and quantifiers, axioms of comprehension and\nextensionality for all orders, and an axiom of infinity. Tarski\nobserves that LGTC suffices, with the help of some tricks, to develop\nall the mathematics that can be developed in the simple theory of\nfinite types, even though it has formally fewer types of\nvariables.\n\nIn the 1933 original Polish version of his monograph Tarski says that\nhis method for constructing truth predicates cannot be applied to the\nconstruction of a truth predicate for LGTC. The problem is that in\n1933 Tarski adopts as the mathematical apparatus of his metalanguages\nthe simple theory of finite types, or equivalently, LGTC. In this\nlanguage, supplemented (and even unsupplemented) by a theory of syntax\nfor LCC, Tarski has everything he needs to give his definition of\nsatisfaction for LCC. In particular, the relation of satisfaction for\nLCC is a relation that can be found in the hierarchy of finite types.\n(Full set theory is not needed.) And the form in which Tarski defines\nit quantifies only over sequences of classes and over relations among\nsequences of classes and formulae (as we may check above), and these\nare objects quantifiable over in finite type theory.\n\nBut the construction of a Tarskian truth predicate for LGTC could not\nbe carried out in finite type theory. The relation of satisfaction for\nLGTC is intuitively a relation among formulae and sequences of:\nsequences of individuals, sequences of classes of individuals,\nsequences of classes of classes of individuals, etc. And this relation\nis not a relation in the hierarchy of finite types. Much less can one\nquantify in finite type theory over the objects necessary to apply the\nTarskian method. One cannot quantify over sequences of: sequences of\nindividuals, sequences of classes of individuals, sequences of classes\nof classes of individuals, etc.; and one cannot quantify over\nrelations among formulae and sequences of: sequences of individuals,\nsequences of classes of individuals, sequences of classes of classes\nof individuals, etc.\n\nIt is this situation that leads Tarski to wonder\n\nwhether our failure is accidental and in some way connected with\ndefects in the methods actually used, or whether obstacles of a\nfundamental kind play a part which are connected with the nature of\nthe concepts we wish to define, or of those with the help of which we\nhave tried to construct the required definitions (Tarski 1983b, p.\n246).\n\n\nThere is a problem even in formulating the question precisely, for, as\nTarski notes,\n\nif the second supposition [of the preceding quotation] is the correct\none all efforts intended to improve the methods of construction would\nclearly be fruitless (Tarski 1983b, p. 246).\n\n\nBut\n\nit will be remembered that in the convention T of\n\u00a73 the conditions which decide the material correctness of any\ndefinition of true sentence are exactly stipulated. The construction\nof a definition which satisfies these conditions forms in fact the\nprincipal object of our investigation. From this standpoint the\nproblem we are now considering takes on a precise form: it is a\nquestion of whether on the basis of the metatheory of the language\nwe are considering the construction of a correct definition of truth\nin the sense of convention T is in principle\npossible. As we shall see, the problem in this form can be\ndefinitively solved, but in a negative sense (Tarski 1983b,\np. 246).\n\n\nThe negative answer is provided by a version of Tarski\u2019s theorem\nof the indefinability of truth. The weakest Tarskian metalanguage for\nLGTC will consist in expanding LGTC by means of concepts and a theory\nof the syntax of LGTC. But the mathematical part of the metalanguage\nwill be the same, for that\u2019s the \u201csufficiently developed\nsystem of mathematical logic\u201d of which Tarski spoke. Further,\nthe metalanguage will obviously contain its object language as part,\nboth its grammar (under no translation) and its deductive system,\nbecause LGTC will appear both in the object language and in the\nmetalanguage (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 247).\n\nIn a word, the metalanguage, which we may call \u201cLGTC+\u201d, is\nLGTC plus a theory of the syntax of LGTC. The question that Tarski\nposes is, then, whether there is a predicate constructible in LGTC+\nwhich verifies the convention T for sentences of\nLGTC. Tarski solves it negatively by proving the following\ntheorem:\n\n\nTheorem I. (a) In whatever way the symbol\n\u201cTr\u201d, denoting a class of expressions, is defined in\nLGTC+, it will be possible to derive from it the negation of one of\nthe sentences which were described in the condition (a) of the\nconvention T;\n\n(b) assuming that the class of all provable sentences of the\nmetatheory is consistent, it is impossible to construct an adequate\ndefinition of truth in the sense of convention T on\nthe basis of LGTC+ (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 247).\n\n\nPart (b) of Theorem I is a trivial consequence of part (a), since it\nis the mark of a consistent system that it doesn\u2019t contain a\nsentence and its negation. The proof of part (a) is an application of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s technique of diagonalization. The following are the\nbasic steps described using the anachronistic recourse to a more\nfamiliar case and to a modern, streamlined notation.\n\nView LGTC as if it were a standard language L for first-order\narithmetic. Suppose we extend it with a theory for talking about the\nsyntax of L (this would not be a Tarskian metalanguage, since it would\nnot include a \u201csufficiently developed system of mathematical\nlogic\u201d, but all this is just for purposes of illustration). Call\nthe extension L+. Then L+ can be \u201cinterpreted\u201d in L using\nG\u00f6delian techniques, by which Tarski means, roughly, that one can\ntranslate L+ into L arithmetizing it in such a way that the\ntranslations of theorems of L+ will be theorems of L. Now suppose that\n\u03c6(n) is the nth expression of L (and that this\nfunction is definable in L+), that d(x) is a\ndiagonal function for expressions of L (which is definable in L+; here\nI have in mind one involving substitution of numerals for free\nvariables), and let n be the numeral of n.\nThen for every predicate E(x) of expressions of L\ndefined in L+ one can prove in L+ a general sentence of the form\n\u2200n[\u00acE(d(\u03c6(n)))\u2194\u03c8(n)],\nwhere \u03c8(n) is a formula with one free variable entirely\nconstructed in L (through the arithmetization of the L+ predicate\n\u201c\u00acE(d(\u03c6(n)))\u201d). Then\none can also prove the sentence\n\u00acE(d(\u03c6(k)))\u2194\u03c8(k),\nwhere k is the G\u00f6del number of \u03c8(n).\nd(\u03c6(k)) is the sentence\n\u03c8(k), so \u03c8(k) is a\n\u201cfixed point\u201d of the predicate \u00acE(x): it\n\u201csays of itself\u201d that it has the property expressed by\n\u00acE(x). The sentence\n\u00acE(d(\u03c6(k)))\u2194\u03c8(k)\nis already equivalent to the sentence\n\u00ac[E(d(\u03c6(k)))\u2194\u03c8(k)],\nand part (a) of Theorem I is proved.\n\nIn the postscript to the 1935 German translation of the monograph on\ntruth, Tarski abandons the 1933 requirement that the apparatus of the\nmetatheory be formalizable in finite type theory, and accepts the use\nof a more powerful theory of transfinite types, where the transfinite\nobjects are classes of the objects of lower types, or the use of set\ntheory. Tarski notes that the relation of satisfaction and a truth\npredicate for LGTC (and LGTC+) are definable in these more powerful\nmetatheories (cf. Tarski 1983b, pp. 271\u20132). But he also says\nthat the proof of the indefinability theorem can be adapted to show\nthat, in general, one cannot define a truth predicate \u201cif the\norder of the metalanguage is at most equal to that of the language\nitself\u201d (Tarski 1983b, p. 273).\n",
