The \u201cSubstance\u201d of Aesthetic Subjectivity\n\nGadamer\u2019s determination to reveal the cognitive content of\naesthetic experience requires him to expose the ontological grounding\nof subjectivity. To approach artworks solely on the basis of\nsubjective responses to them or, to read them only in terms of an\nartist\u2019s intentionality, is, for Gadamer, always to miss the\npoint. Hermeneutically speaking, the philosophical focus should be on\nwhat shapes subjectivity and guides its expectations. This initiates a\nspeculative refiguring of aesthetic subjectivity. In Truth and\nMethod he writes,\n\nAll self-knowledge arises from what is historically pre-given, what\nwith Hegel we call \u201csubstance,\u201d because it underlies all\nsubjective intentions and actions, and hence both prescribes and\nlimits every possibility for understanding any tradition whatsoever in\nits historical alterity. This almost defines the aim of philosophical\nhermeneutics: its task is to retrace the path of Hegel\u2019s\nphenomenology of mind until we discover in all that is subjective the\nsubstantiality that determines it. (TM 302)\n\n\nIn his essay \u201cImage and Gesture\u201d\u00a0Gadamer elucidates\nsubstance as follows:\n\n\u201cSubstance\u201d is understood as something that supports us,\nalthough it does not emerge into the light of reflective\nconsciousness, it is something that can never be fully articulated,\nalthough it is absolutely necessary for the existence of all clarity,\nconsciousness, expression and communication. (RB 78)\n\n\nUncovering the ontological foundations of aesthetic experience does\nnot undermine the primacy Gadamer gives to art\u2019s immediate\naddress. The aim is to demonstrate the cognitive legitimacy of\nsubjective experience by revealing how aesthetic experience is both\ninvolved in something larger than itself and, indeed, reflects\n(speculum) that larger actuality within itself. The ability\nof aesthetic experience to express trans-individual phenomenological\nstructures explains what is meant by substance and his speculative\nattitude towards it. Gadamer\u2019s aesthetics is properly concerned\nwith experiencing what underlies its more abstract concepts.\nThis is not a matter of naming or describing the reality which\nmanifests itself in aesthetic experience but of trying to say\nsomething about the experience an individual has of it.\nGadamer\u2019s reflections commence with the immediacy of art\u2019s\nclaim, its contemporaneous nature, and then explore what influences\nthe experience of that claim. The aim is seemingly paradoxical: to\nunderstand that which shapes, lies beyond, but only\n\u201cshows\u201d itself in aesthetic experience.\n",
