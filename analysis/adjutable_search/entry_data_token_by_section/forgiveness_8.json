    "main_text": "Theories of Forgiveness || Emotion Accounts\n5.1 Emotion Accounts\n\nIt is widely thought that forgiveness is fundamentally a matter of how\none feels about another. Jeffrie Murphy, for example, claims that\n\u201c[f]orgiveness is primarily a matter of how I feel\nabout you (not how I treat you)\u201d (Murphy & Hampton 1988: 21;\ncf. Hughes 1993: 108). Broadly speaking, emotion accounts of\nforgiveness claim that forgiveness is best understood as fundamentally\na change in emotion. According to such views, were you to be wronged,\nyour forgiving the wrongdoer fundamentally involves your overcoming\n(or abating, or eliminating, or forswearing) some relevant negative\nemotion (e.g., resentment, hatred, rancor) that you experience because\nyou were wronged. For example, Kathleen Dean Moore writes, that\n\u201cthe attitude of forgiveness is characterized by the presence of\ngood will and by the lack of personal resentment for the injury\u201d\n(1989:184). Norvin Richards claims that to \u201cforgive someone for\nhaving wronged one is to abandon all negative feelings based on the\nepisode in question\u201d (1988: 79). Stephen Darwall also appears to\ndefend some kind of emotion account when he says that to\n\u201cforgive is, roughly, to forbear or withdraw resentment\u201d\n(2006: 72). \n\nAmong the various emotion accounts, however, there is significant\ndisagreement on two main points: (1) about which specific emotions are\nimplicated in forgiveness; and (2) about what must be done with those\nemotions in order to forgive. We survey emotion accounts by taking\nthese two issues in turn.\n\nOne way to differentiate between the varieties of emotion accounts is\naccording to the emotion or set of emotions that are thought to be\nrelevant to forgiveness. A cursory survey of the forgiveness\nliterature might give one the impression that there is widespread\nagreement about which emotion is crucially implicated in forgiveness.\nThat emotion is resentment. The view that forgiveness crucially\nimplicates resentment is usually taken to be \u201creceived\northodoxy\u201d (Bash 2007: 161; cf. Kekes 2009: 490; Radzik 2009:\n117; and Zaibert 2009: 38). But any impression of wholesale agreement\nwould be mistaken for two reasons. First, some emotion theorists argue\nthat overcoming resentment is neither necessary nor sufficient for\nforgiveness. Such emotion theorists hold that in forgiving there are\nother emotions that may or must be overcome. And second, even\namong those who hold that overcoming resentment is either necessary or\nsufficient for forgiveness, there is disagreement about what\nresentment is. Some think of resentment as a \u201chostile\nfeeling\u201d which aims at inflicting harm on the wrongdoer (Garrard\n& McNaughton 2002), while others think of it as a kind of\n\u201cmoral protest\u201d (Hieronymi 2001), while still others think\nof resentment as the paradigmatic sort of \u201cmoral anger\u201d\n(Hughes 1993). Whereas some describe resentment as a\n\u201cvindictive passion\u201d (Murphy 2003: 16) others claim that\nresentment \u201cneed not entail motivation to retaliate for the\nwrong\u201d (Holmgren 2012: 31). In recent work, Jeffrey Blustein\ndescribes resentment as being a member of a class of attitudes that\nare \u201cfeelings of insult\u201d (2014: 33; cf. Murphy &\nHampton 1988: 44\u20135).\n\nIt is difficult to know what exactly these characterizations of\nresentment amount to, what kinds of relations hold between them, and\nperhaps most importantly, which view is correct. Indeed, this is one\nof the more troublesome aspects of the philosophical literature on\nforgiveness: while it is commonly thought that forgiveness crucially\nimplicates resentment, there is no such consensus about what\nresentment is (contra Holmgren 2012: 35). And as we\nhave already noted, even though resentment is widely thought to be the\ncentral or paradigmatic emotion that forgiveness implicates, not all\nemotional accounts accept that view.\n\nSo here is a rough and ready way of categorizing the various emotion\naccounts as regards the set of relevant emotions that forgiveness\nimplicates. Let minimal emotionalism be the view that in\norder to forgive, one must overcome a very narrow set of emotions:\nonly \u201chostile retributive feelings\u201d, attitudes whose aim\nis to see the offender suffer for what she has done (Garrard &\nMcNaughton 2002: 44). Examples of such emotions include the feelings\nof malice, spite, or ill-will that might arise as a response to being\nwronged. The minimal emotionalist can allow that there are lots of\nnegative emotions that one might experience upon being wronged (e.g.,\nanger, sadness, disappointment, hurt), but they claim that forgiveness\nrequires only that we overcome a small subset of them\u2014those\nemotions that might be best described as vengeful or hostile.\n\nAlternatively, let moderate emotionalism be the view that in\norder to forgive, one must overcome both hostile retributive\nfeelings and what we may call moral anger. According to\nmoderate emotionalism, overcoming hostile feelings is not enough for\nforgiveness. One may harbor moral anger towards a wrongdoer (so the\nview goes) without thereby wishing that she suffers for what she did.\nBut both moral anger and hostile feelings must be given up in\norder to forgive. Paul Hughes defends something like moderate\nemotionalism. An attitude counts as moral anger according to Hughes if\nit is \u201cpartially constituted by the belief that you have been\nwrongfully harmed by another\u201d (1993: 331). As Hughes notes, not\nall anger is moral; if you are angry because a bird drops a gift on\nyour head, your anger is non-moral for it is not constituted by a\nbelief that the bird has done you a wrong. But because resentment is,\naccording to Hughes, a paradigm case of moral anger, it must be\novercome in order for one to forgive. Charles Griswold also appears to\nhave in mind a kind of moderate emotionalism:\n\n\nForswearing resentment does not require giving up every\n\u2018negative\u2019 feeling associated with the injurious event\n[\u2026] Forgiveness does however mean overcoming negative feelings\nthat embody and perpetuate the key features of resentment, feelings\nthat very often accompany resentment\u2014such as contempt and\nscorn\u2014insofar as they are modulations of the moral\nhatred in question. (2007: 41)\n\n\nAlthough Griswold thinks of resentment as a kind of moral hatred, he\ndoes not think of resentment as involving a desire to inflict\nsuffering on the wrongdoer, but rather as a desire to \u201cexact a\ndue measure of punishment\u201d (2007: 26). In this respect his view\ndiffers from Garrard and McNaughton, who do target those\nemotions that involve desires to inflict suffering on the\nwrongdoer.\n\nFinally, let expansive emotionalism be the view that in order\nto forgive a wrongdoer, the victim must overcome all negative\nemotions that the victim has towards the wrongdoer on account of the\nwrongdoing in question. Norvin Richards is commonly cited as a\ndefender of what we are calling expansive emotionalism: \u201cto\nforgive someone for having wronged one is to abandon all negative\nfeelings based on the episode in question\u201d (1988: 79). On\nRichards\u2019 view, not only must one overcome emotions like malice\nand moral anger in order to forgive, one must also overcome emotions\nlike sadness and disappointment (1988: 77\u201379). In recent work,\nJeffrie Murphy has also endorsed a more expansive emotionalism.\nAlthough he once argued that forgiveness ought to be construed\nnarrowly as the overcoming of resentment, Murphy has now, citing the\ninfluence of Richards and others, become more ecumenical, writing that\nwe should \n\n\nthink of forgiveness as overcoming a variety of negative feelings that\none might have toward a wrongdoer\u2014resentment, yes, but also such\nfeelings as anger, hatred, loathing, contempt, indifference,\ndisappointment, or even sadness. (2003: 59; see also Holmgren 1993:\n341 and Blustein 2014) \n\n\nThe set of emotions that victims might possess in response to being\nwronged by another agent therefore form a large and diverse\nlandscape.\n\nEmotion theorists claim that in order to forgive one must make certain\nalterations to one\u2019s emotional life. But what kind of changes\nmust occur? Writers on forgiveness often speak of the\novercoming of resentment. In doing so we follow precedent\n(e.g., Murphy 2003: 16; Holmgren 1993: 341). But other writers have\nclaimed that one is to \u201cabandon\u201d (Richards 1988: 184) or\n\u201cforbear or withdraw\u201d (Darwall 2006: 72) resentment. Still\nothers claim that forgiveness involves \u201cletting go\u201d of\n(Griswold 2007: 40) or the \u201celimination of\u201d (Lauritzen\n1987: 142) resentment. Rarely is much more said about the machinery of\nthese proposed changes to one\u2019s emotional life (notable\nexceptions include Hughes 1993, Hieronymi 2001, and Blustein 2014). We\ntherefore want to know what kinds of changes are at issue with respect\nto each of these claims, and what relations hold between them? Does,\nfor example, overcoming resentment entail that one has totally\neliminated it? There are at least two facts about the relevant notion\nof overcoming about which most emotion theorists seem to agree.\n\nFirst, emotion theorists have been keen to clarify that it is not just\nany kind of elimination of resentment that is at issue. Were\nyou accidentally to fall and hit your head on a rock, thereby causing\nyour resentment to be eliminated, you would not have forgiven. Or if\nyour resentment simply withered away over the years via a process\noutside of your control or ken, it is widely thought that you would\nnot have forgiven (cf. Horsbrugh 1974: 271). Emotion theorists\ntherefore usually require that the forgiver\u2019s resentment be\novercome for reasons (e.g., Murphy 2001: 561). What kinds of\nreasons? Sometimes the right kinds of reasons are claimed to be\nspecifically moral reasons (Murphy 2003: 16; Griswold 2007:\n40). Murphy suggests that the fact that the wrongdoer \u201crepented\nor had a change of heart\u201d, \u201cmeant well (his motives were\ngood)\u201d, or \u201che has suffered enough\u201d are the right\nkinds of reasons (1988: 24). But here, we should be careful to\ndistinguish between two different questions. One question is a\nconceptual one, concerning what kinds of motivating reasons make\nforgiveness possible at all. But another kind of question, a\nnormative one, concerns what motivating reasons make forgiveness, on\nany given occasion, appropriate (or permissible or\npraiseworthy). If Murphy is right, then it appears that one cannot\nforgive because one wanted to win a bet. This raises questions as to\nhow moralized our conception of forgiveness ought to be. Should our\naccount of forgiveness require that in order to forgive, one must do\nso for (only) moral reasons? Or could one forgive for merely\nprudential reasons (Ingram 2013)? We will return to this issue\nbelow.\n\nSecond, it is widely thought that the kind of overcoming of resentment\nthat is implicated in forgiveness involves what Marilyn McCord Adams\ndescribes as \u201cagent effort\u201d (1991: 284). Even when one\neliminates resentment for (the right) reasons, it is possible to do so\nusing the wrong kind of process. Forgiveness therefore must\nhave the right kind of history. Suppose, for example, that one sought\nto forgive and that the miracle of modern medicine produced a pill\nthat, if ingested, could immediately eliminate one\u2019s resentment.\nIt has seemed to many that taking the resentment-eliminating pill does\nnot qualify as forgiving (even if one were to take the pill for the\nright kinds of reasons). Why? It\u2019s hard to say exactly, but many\nphilosophers think of forgiveness as a manifestation of a virtue, a\ndisposition to act and feel in certain ways (Roberts 1995; Pettigrove\n2012). On this view, forgiving acts are properly understood as being\nthe kinds of things that must \u201cgo through\u201d the agent in a\ncertain sort of way, either by way of an agential\n\u201cstruggle\u201d against resentment or a decision to give up or\ndo without resentment (what is commonly described as\n\u201cforswearing\u201d).\n\nStill, many questions remain. First, which processes of overcoming the\nrelevant emotions are the right ones? Hieronymi (2001) argues that in\nparadigmatic cases, resentment is eliminated by revising a specific\njudgment that rationally supports it, namely the judgment that the\nwrongdoer\u2019s past action stands as a present threat. For\ndiscussions of this judgment-based approach to how forgiveness\novercomes resentment see Zaragoza (2012), Nelkin (2013), and Warmke\n(2015). Blustein (2014) argues that overcoming the relevant emotions\nshould be understood as involving a certain kind of forgetting.\n\nSecond: need the relevant emotions be eliminated completely or perhaps\nonly moderated, and what are we to say if the relevant emotions return\n(perhaps unbidden, perhaps not) at some point in the future? One\nmight, for example, hold that a forgiver must eliminate all traces of\nthe relevant negative emotion(s). It is uncommon to find this view\nstated explicitly, but Haber has attributed to it to some philosophers\n(1991: 7). Others have claimed that what is needed is not the total\nand final elimination of resentment, but rather, some sort of\nmoderation. Margaret Holmgren, for example, allows that resentment can\nreoccur:\n\n\nBy overcoming her negative feelings at the time she forgives, the\nvictim does not necessarily eliminate these feelings without a trace.\nThey may recur from time to time throughout her life. However, once\nshe has determined that forgiveness is the appropriate attitude\ntowards her offender and has overcome her negative feelings towards\nhim, it will presumably be possible for her to conquer these feelings\nagain if they do recur. Thus we can plausibly say that the victim has\nforgiven her offender when she first overcomes her resentment towards\nhim. (1993: 341\u20132)\n\n\nThere is also a strand of discussion in the forgiveness literature\nthat crucially implicates the forswearing of resentment (or\nsome other attitude or behavior). P.F. Strawson claims:\n\n\n[T]o ask to be forgiven is in part to acknowledge that the attitude\ndisplayed in our actions was such as might properly be resented and in\npart to repudiate that attitude for the future (or at least for the\nimmediate future); and to forgive is to accept the repudiation and to\nforswear the resentment. (1962: 76)\n\n\nThe difference between overcoming and forswearing (or renouncing) some\nattitude is not usually made explicit. Sometimes the terms appear to\nbe used interchangeably. Marilyn McCord Adams, however, distinguishes\novercoming an attitude (which she suggests involves\n\u201cagent effort\u201d) from forswearing an attitude,\nwhich she describes as a \u201cdeliberate act\u201d (1991: 284). The\nimplication is that forswearing (as an act of renunciation) is\nsomething one does straightaway, whereas overcoming is not. One may\nforswear resentment by making a decision or making a commitment, but\nto decide to give up or commit to eliminate resentment does not imply\nthat one has or will overcome it.\n",
