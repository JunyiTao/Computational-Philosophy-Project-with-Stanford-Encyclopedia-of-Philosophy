    "main_text": "\n\n\nFranz Rosenzweig (1886\u20131929) ranks as one of the most original Jewish\nthinkers of the modern period. As a historian of philosophy,\nRosenzweig played a brief but noteworthy role in the neo-Hegelian\nrevival on the German intellectual scene of the 1910s. In the years\nimmediately following the First World War, he sought to bring about\nthe \u201ctotal renewal of thinking\u201d through a novel synthesis\nof philosophy and theology he named the \u201cnew thinking.\u201d\nRosenzweig\u2019s account of revelation as a call from the Absolute other\nhelped shape the course of early 20th-century Jewish and\nChristian theology. His reflections on human finitude and on the\ntemporal contours of human experience made a lasting impact on\n20th-century existentialism; and his account of dialogue\npresented the interpersonal relation between \u201cI\u201d and\n\u201cYou\u201d as both constitutive of selfhood and as yielding\nredemptive communal consequences. Rosenzweig engaged in two major\nworks of translation, most notably the German translation of the Bible\nin which he collaborated with Martin Buber. He founded a center for\nJewish adult education in\nFrankfurt\u2014the Lehrhaus\u2014which attracted the most\nimportant young German-Jewish intellectuals of its time, and which is\nstill held up today as a model for educational programs of its\ntype.\n\n\nRosenzweig\u2019s renown, especially in Jewish and Christian\nintellectual circles, stems in large part from a fascination with his\ncompelling biography, a biography that included a near-conversion to\nChristianity, an inspired return to Judaism, the composition of the\nbeginning of his magnum opus on military postcards sent home\nfrom the Balkan front, the abandonment of a promising academic career\nin order to live and teach in the Frankfurt Jewish community, and his\nheroic efforts to continue his thinking, writing, and communal work\nafter succumbing to the paralysis brought on by ALS. But\nRosenzweig\u2019s singular philosophical importance rests almost\nentirely on his having written what is arguably the greatest work of\nmodern Jewish philosophy: The Star of Redemption. The\nStar is a system of philosophy that seeks to give a\ncomprehensive and ramified account of \u201cAll\u201d that is, and of\nthe human being\u2019s place within that \u201cAll\u201d. It is a\nsystem in which \u201crevelation\u201d plays a vital conceptual and\nmethodological role, and in which Judaism and Christianity are claimed\nto offer glimpses, each through the course of its liturgical calendar,\nof the redemptive unity of the \u201cAll\u201d which the philosopher\nseeks to know.\n",
