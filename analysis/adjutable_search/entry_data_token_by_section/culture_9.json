    "main_text": "Minority Cultural Rights Claims || Recognition rights\n2.4 Recognition rights\n\nThe\u00a0demand for formal recognition in legal and political\ndocuments often travels with the demand for self-determination, and is\ngrounded in a desire to have the majority mark its commitment to the\nfull and equal respect of a cultural minority group (Mcbride\n2009).\u00a0In the Canadian case, the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois have\nlong fought for recognition as a nation, with a \u201cdistinct\nsociety\u201d. Attempts to recognize Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s status in\nthe Canadian constitution have repeatedly failed, though a motion that\nread \u201cThat this House recognize that the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\nform a nation within a united Canada\u201d was approved (with\nconsiderable controversy, however) by the House of Commons in 2006.\nThe demand for recognition in this case is a demand for respect as an\nequal, national, founding partner of the Canadian state.\n\nIn the case of Indigenous communities as well, the right to\nself-determination often includes not only the demand to exercise\nauthority over specific jurisdictions, but also for\u00a0recognition.\nThey seek recognition, for example, as original inhabitants of a\nparticular state, or as nations in their own right, or as having been\nthe victims of various crimes at the hands of colonizers, including\nthe violation of early treaties between them, as well as demands for\nstate support in sustaining and, in many cases, rebuilding communities\nthat were actively devastated by colonizing/settler governments. In\nCanada, and other colonizing states, for example, it has become common\nto read land acknowledgement statements in advance of events\n(including as part of the \u201cannouncements\u201d read at the\nbeginning of a school day), recognizing that events and proceedings\nare taking place on unceded Indigenous land.\nSimilarly,\u00a0Australian Indigenous communities\u00a0have long\nargued for official recognition in the Australian constitution. From\nthe perspective of\u00a0Australian Indigenous communities, the hope,\nand indeed the expectation, is that official recognition will give\nrise to additional rights and benefits, for example to greater voice\nand political access to members of the minority. The hope for\nadditional rights and benefits is present in some, but not all, cases\nof recognition claims (for example, it largely was not present in the\ncase of Qu\u00e9bec).\n\nRecognition comes in other forms beyond acknowledgement in legal and\npolitical documents, that are intended to confirm respect for minority\ngroups. In some states, the languages of minority groups can be\nofficially recognized as national languages. For example, the\nRomansh language in Switzerland is officially recognized as a\nnational language, even though its speakers make up less than 1% of\nthe country\u2019s total population. By contrast, Turkish laws that\nbanned the speaking of Kurdish in public spaces were\u00a0an attempt\nto deny recognition to a national minority (lifted finally in 1991).\nAs with demands for official recognition in binding constitutional\ndocuments, these sorts of recognition demonstrate respect for minority\ncommunities as well as a commitment to treating them as full and equal\nmembers of the larger state.\n",
