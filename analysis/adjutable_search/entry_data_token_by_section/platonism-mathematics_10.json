    "main_text": "The Fregean Argument for Existence || The notion of ontological commitment\n2.4 The notion of ontological commitment\n\nVersions of the Fregean argument are sometimes stated in terms of the\nnotion of ontological commitment. Suppose we operate with the standard\nQuinean criterion of ontological commitment:\n\nQuine\u2019s Criterion.\nA first-order sentence (or collection of such sentences) is\nontologically committed to such objects as must be assumed to be in\nthe range of the variables for the sentence (or collection of\nsentences) to be true.\n\n\nThen it follows from Classical Semantics that many\nsentences of mathematics are ontologically committed to mathematical\nobjects. To see this, consider a typical mathematical theorem \\(S\\),\nwhich involves some normal extensional occurrence of either singular\nterms or first-order quantifiers. By Classical\nSemantics, these expressions purport to refer to or range\nover mathematical objects. For \\(S\\) to be true, these expressions\nmust succeed in doing what they purport to do. Consequently, for \\(S\\)\nto be true, there must be mathematical objects in the range of the\nvariables. By Quine\u2019s Criterion this means that\n\\(S\\) is ontologically committed to mathematical objects.\n\nQuine and many others take Quine\u2019s Criterion to\nbe little more than a definition of the term \u2018ontological\ncommitment\u2019 (Quine 1969 and Burgess 2004). But the criterion has\nnevertheless been challenged. Some philosophers deny that singular\nterms and first-order quantifiers automatically give rise to\nontological commitments. Perhaps what is \u201crequired of the\nworld\u201d for the sentence to be true involves the existence of\nsome but not all of the objects in the range of the quantifiers (Rayo\n2008). Or perhaps we should sever the link between the first-order\nexistential quantifier and the notion of ontological commitment\n(Azzouni 2004, Hofweber 2000 and 2016).\n\nOne response to these challenges is to observe that the Fregean\nargument was developed above without any use of the term\n\u2018ontological commitment\u2019. Any challenge to the definition\nof \u2018ontological commitment\u2019 provided by\nQuine\u2019s Criterion therefore appears irrelevant\nto the version of the Fregean argument developed above. However, this\nresponse is unlikely to satisfy the challengers, who will respond that\nthe conclusion of the argument developed above is too weak to have its\nintended effect. Recall that the conclusion,\nExistence, is formalized in our philosophical\nmeta-language \\(L_P\\) as \u2018\\(\\exists xMx\\)\u2019. So this\nformalization will fail to have its intended effect unless this\nmeta-language sentence is of the sort that incurs ontological\ncommitment. But that is precisely what the challengers dispute. This\ncontroversy cannot be pursued further here. For now, we simply observe\nthat the challengers need to provide an account of why their\nnon-standard notion of ontological commitment is better and\ntheoretically more interesting than the standard Quinean notion.\n",
