    "main_text": "Human Nature and the Person || Rejection of Buddhist and Darwinian Views on Human Nature\n4.1 Rejection of Buddhist and Darwinian Views on Human Nature\n\nXiong Shili focused on reality and phenomena, but he does have a few\nremarks on human nature that leave some important clues. One reason\nXiong began to criticize orthodox Yogacara is that he was dissatisfied\nwith how they categorized cognitions, but he also wanted to assert the\nessential goodness of human nature. One of his criticisms of Buddhists\nis that they treated evil as an innate part of human nature, which\nwould imply that it cannot (and perhaps should not) be eradicated.\n\n\n[The Yogacara monk Dharmap\u0101la] presumed that of the various\nproductive powers, there are those that are contaminated and those\nthat are uncontaminated, and hence he used \u201cproductive\npower\u201d to refer to both. This is to hold living beings in\ndisdain, and resolutely to uphold [the existence of] the root of evil.\nHis stupidity and boorishness were great indeed. He agreed that there\nhas always been contaminated productive power\u2014that the root of\nevil in humans is innately endowed. (Xiong 1932 [2015: 141])\n\n\nThe correct view is that human nature is undefiled. Habituated\ntendencies can be good or bad, accord with human nature or not, but\nthey are adventitious and do not affect the pure inherent nature\n(Xiong 1932 [2015: 144\u201346]). In short, evil is not part of human\nnature and the human task is to remove defiled habituated tendencies\nand return to that fundamental nature (Major 2021: 941\u201342).\nXiong returned to the classic Song-Ming Confucian position on human\nnature.\n\nXiong simultaneously rejected Darwinism, partly on the grounds\ndescribed by Tang Junyi above, failing to distinguish between human\nbeings and animals, and partly because the picture of organisms\ncompeting for individual survival did not comport with his worldview.\nEvolutionary ideas had been introduced into China with Yan Fu\u2019s\nheavily edited translation of Thomas Henry Huxley (1898), which could\nbe better described as a reworking of the text than a translation as\nYan freely rearranged it and added much of his own commentary (Sun\n2022). The potential consequences of Darwin\u2019s view of survival\nof the fittest are described precisely by a hypothetical interlocutor\nin Xiong\u2019s text:\n\n\nThe myriad life forms are fond of antipathy and like to kill. World\nhistory reads largely as a book of mutual annihilation\u2026.\nSomeone asked, \u201cIt is certain that antipathy is something that\nappears late [among sentient beings.] This can be verified by\nDarwin\u2019s theory of the survival of the fittest, according to\nwhich it should be that antipathy also arises from the need to\nsurvive. There is no need to deem it to be an affliction\u201d. I\nreplied, \u201cThe facts discovered by those who endorse the theory\nof mutualism are clearly at odds with Darwin\u2019s thesis\u2026.\n[Cheng] Yichuan also said: \u2018It is only by closely helping one\nanother that all living things between heaven and earth are able to\nlive.\u2019 Everything he said was verified. It is thus understood\nthat living existence requires close help and not competition\u201d.\n(Xiong 1932 [2015: 259\u201360])\n\n\nThe moral consequences of evolution (as he understood them) were\nunacceptable to Xiong. Although he of course knew the history of\nviolence between human beings, this is not how life has to be or\nshould be. Treating hate and competition as part of human nature\nimplies accepting it. That would fundamentally contradict\nXiong\u2019s picture not just of human nature, but of how the world\nworks. What Xiong did not do was expand much on what human nature is,\nor, aside from reliance on personal experience (Xiong 1932 [2015:\n204\u20135]; Major 2021: 947\u201348), how we know it and realize\nit. Mou, Tang, and Xu all developed theories about this.\n",
