    "main_text": "Contemporary Pragmatic Theory || Relevance Theory\n3.2 Relevance Theory\n\nAccording to relevance theory this is a mistake. Sperber and Wilson\n(1986) see things the second way. Following Grice\u2019s model,\nunderstanding what someone means by an utterance is a matter of\ninferring the speaker\u2019s communicative intention: the\nhearer uses all kinds of information available to get at what the\nspeaker intended to convey. The semantic information obtained by\ndecoding the sentence uttered is but one example of such information.\nBut much more information has to be used to infer what the speaker\nmeant \u2014 that includes both what she said and what she implicated\n\u2014 by her utterance. So central is intention-recognition to\nunderstanding language that the code model, with autonomous semantics\nat its core, should largely be abandoned in favor of the inferential\nmodel. One kind of pragmatic reasoning pervades language use,\nnear-side and far-side, and the areas in which the code model is\napplicable are basically marginal. \n\nThe need for supplementary information is too pervasive and too\nimportant to be a matter of something specifically linguistic, as\nmight be suggested by Grice\u2019s conversational principle and\nmaxims. Sperber and Wilson see the fundamental mechanism of such\ninferences as going well beyond language, and beyond humans. In terms\nof Carston\u2019s distinctions, relevance theory departs from\nGrice\u2019s philosophical project, and aims at an empirical\npsychological theory of human cognition and communication. They see\nthe phenomenon they call \u2018relevance\u2019 as a psychological\nphenomenon basic to the lives not only of humans but of all animals\nwith a cognitive repertoire sophisticated enough to have choices about\nwhich environmental cues to attend to. Evolution shapes the phenomenon\nof relevance; an animal\u2019s attention is drawn to environmental\ncues that provide the most crucial information. Sounds of an\napproaching cat grabs a bird\u2019s attention away from a worm;\nparents are alert to the sounds of their baby\u2019s crying. The\nphenomenon is extended through learning; the squeal of brakes grabs a\ndriver\u2019s attention away from a pretty sunset. And the cues can\nbe conventional; the dinner bell grabs the attention of the hungry\nchild. The phenomenon of relevance in language is another\nmanifestation of this very general phenomenon. \u2018Relevance\u2019\nin relevance theory, then, should not be taken to be just our ordinary\nconception of relevance; nor should it be equated with the\n\u2018relevance\u2019 of Grice\u2019s maxim, although it is\nconnected to that and intended to provide a deepened understanding of\nwhat underlies the maxim.\n\nRelevance theory emphasizes that the rules of language leave all sorts\nof issues open. Some words have too many meanings: ambiguity. Others\nhave too little meaning: \u2018he,\u2019 or \u2018that.\u2019\nDecoding alone won\u2019t determine which meaning the speaker is\nusing, or which object she intends to refer to with a pronoun. So even\nbefore we get to what is said, communication involves intentions on\nthe part of the speaker that go beyond what she \u201ccodes-up\u201d\ninto language, and inferences on the part of the hearer that go beyond\ndecoding. And of course when we consider what is conveyed beyond\nsaying, the coding model is even less adequate. In all of these ways\nin which knowledge of convention falls short, relevance fills the\ngap.\n\nA second difference rooted in the psychological conception of\npragmatics is reliance on the representational theory of mind. The\ntenets of relevance theory are couched in talk of processing\nrepresentations, rather than, and sometimes in addition to, the\nordinary terminology of philosophical psychology.\n\nThus, instead of Grice\u2019s cooperative principle and\nconversational maxims, relevance theory postulates principles of\nrelevance, which stem from the applicability of the general phenomenon\nof relevance to linguistic situations in the context of a\nrepresentational theory of mind. There are two fundamental\nprinciples.\n3.2.1 The Principles of Relevance\n\nPragmatic relevance is a property of utterances as a particular case\nof inputs to cognitive processes: \n\nAn input is relevant to an individual when it connects with available\ncontextual assumptions to yield POSITIVE COGNITIVE EFFECTS: for\nexample, true contextual implications, or warranted strengthenings or\nrevisions of existing assumptions. (Sperber & Wilson 2005, 7)\n\n\nThe relevance of an input for an individual is a matter of degree. In\ngeneral, the greater those positive cognitive effects with the smaller\nmental effort to get them, the greater the relevance of the input for\nthe individual. Sperber and Wilson conjecture that the cognitive\narchitecture of human beings tends to the maximization of relevance.\nThis is what their first principle of relevance states:\n\nFirst (cognitive) principle of relevance: Human cognition is\ngeared towards the maximization of relevance (that is, to the\nachievement of as many contextual (cognitive) effects as possible for\nas little processing effort as possible).\n\n\nThis is the general cognitive principle that serves as background for\ncommunication in general and linguistic communication in particular.\nApplied to linguistic communication, this involves the following: For\na communicative act to be successful, the speaker needs the\naddressee\u2019s attention; since everyone is geared towards the\nmaximization of relevance, the speaker should try to make her\nutterance relevant enough to be worth the addressee\u2019s attention.\nThis leads us to the\n\nSecond (communicative) principle of relevance: Every act of\nostensive communication (e.g. an utterance) communicates a presumption\nof its own optimal relevance.\n\n\nBy \u2018ostensive\u2019 relevance theorists make reference to the\n\u2018overt\u2019 or \u2018public\u2019 nature of the\nspeaker\u2019s communicative intentions in acts of communication.\nCommunication will be successful (i.e., understanding will occur) when\nthe addressee recognizes those intentions. This process is mostly\ninferential and it has costs. So, the addressee would not start the\ninferential process without a presumption that it will report her some\nbenefits, that is, without a presumption that the input is not only\nrelevant, but as relevant as it can, ceteris paribus. Then,\nwhen someone utters something with a communicative purpose, she does\nit, according to relevance theory, with the presumption of optimal\nrelevance, which states that\n\nThe utterance is relevant enough to be worth processing.\nIt is the most relevant one compatible with the\ncommunicator\u2019s abilities and preferences.\n\n3.2.2 Implicated Premises and Conclusions\n\nAlthough the principles of relevance account for near-side and\nfar-side inferences, relevance theory acknowledges a fundamental\ndistinction. On the near side, ambiguities, references, and issues of\nvagueness will be resolved so as to make the \u2018explicature\u2019\n\u2014 the relevance theoretic replacement for \u2018what is\nsaid,\u2019 or \u2018the proposition expressed\u2019 \u2014\nmaximally relevant. A somewhat more complex sort of reasoning then\nderives implicatures. But these processes are not sequential. The\n\u2018choice\u2019 of explicature will be affected by the need to\ncome to an understanding of everything that is communicated,\nexplicature and implicature, as maximally relevant.\n\nThe addressee\u2019s understanding process starts then when she\nperceives an ostensive stimulus and stops when her expectations of\nrelevance are satisfied, that is, when she has the most relevant\nhypothesis (the one with the most positive cognitive effects at the\nleast processing costs) about the speaker\u2019s communicative\nintention. After decoding the sentence uttered and getting at the\nproposition expressed, the hearer will built a \u2018context\u2019\nof \u2018implicated premises\u2019 or assumptions for getting the\ncognitive positive effects that make the utterance relevant. Remember\nthat those effects can be the reinforcement or revision of those\nassumptions but also conclusions obtained deducing then from the\nproposition expressed plus the context of premises. This context\nbuilding will also be highly constrained by relevance, looking for as\nmany positive effects as possible with the fewer inferential steps as\npossible. In addition, the hearer has to look for the contents or\nassumptions the speaker ostensively intends her to consider.\n\nConsider the following exchange between A and B:\n\nHave you seen The Da Vinci Code?\nI don\u2019t like action movies.\n\n\nIt is reasonable to think that in B\u2019s response has the following\nimplicatures, as implicated premise and conclusion, respectively: \n\nPremise: That The Da Vinci Code is an action\nmovie.\nConclusion: That B has not seen it and, maybe, does not\nintend to see it.\n\n\nA retrieves the premise that together with the content of B\u2019s\nresponse allows her to deduce a conclusion that is reasonable to think\nB intends her to make, given that it seems the most relevant (the one\nwith more cognitive positive effects \u2014 as implicatures in this\ncase \u2014 with low processing costs).\n\nThis is how relevance theory re-interprets the Gricean notion of\nparticularized conversational implicatures: they are treated as\nimplicated premises and conclusions, communicated beyond what the\nspeaker says. On the other hand, relevance theorists abandon the\ncategory of generalized conversational implicatures. The phenomena\nGrice took to be as generalized conversational implicatures belong on\nthe near side according to relevance theorists. They are not part of\nwhat is implicated by the speaker in making her utterance, but part of\nthe explicature.\n\nAccording to this view, pragmatics in general and the principle of\nrelevance in particular have a lot to say about what happens on the\nnear side of the explicature. It is probably fair to say that\nrelevance theorists are mainly responsible for contemporary pragmatics\nfocusing not only on what is conveyed beyond saying but also on saying\nitself, and for the fact that, as we shall see below, contemporary\nphilosophical pragmatic theory tends to focus on the extent to which\npragmatics \u2018intrudes\u2019 upon the traditional turf of\nsemantics.\n3.3 A Theory of Utterance-Type-Meaning\n\nTogether with Horn\u2019s (1984, 1989, 2004), Levinson\u2019s work\n(2000) is a good representative of grammar-oriented pragmatics.\nLevinson is only marginally a neo-Gricean. He is not committed to\nGrice\u2019s fundamental two-fold division between what is said, on\nthe one hand, and implicatures, on the other \u2014 he proposes a\nthird level of default or preferred interpretation. He does not\nprovide a theory of utterance comprehension based primarily on\nrecognition of communicative intentions, for default interpretations\nare not concerned with that. However, he does assume conversational\nprinciples and maxims, formulating a series of heuristics, inspired by\nGrice\u2019s maxims, for a theory of Generalized Conversational\nImplicatures (GCIs) that, as important as they were in Grice\u2019s\nprogram, have been neglected by many post-Gricean authors.\nLevinson\u2019s GCI theory is not a philosophical theory of human\ncommunication, nor a psychological theory of utterance understanding,\nbut a partial theory of utterance-type meaning with its focus on\nlinguistics. As he puts it:\n\nIn the composite theory of meaning, the theory of GCIs plays just a\nsmall role in a general theory of communication\u2026 It is just to\nlinguistic theory that GCIs have an unparalleled import.\n(Levinson 2000, pp. 21\u201322.)\n\n\nThe two-layered view of utterance content consisting, according to\nLevinson, of a level of encoded meaning (sentence-meaning)\nand a level of inferential meaning (speaker\u2019s or\nutterance-(token)-meaning), must be supplemented by a third\nintermediate layer of utterance-type-meaning which is not\nbased \u201con direct computations on speaker-intentions but rather\non general expectations about how language is normally used\u201d (p.\n22).\n\nThese expectations are formulated by Levinson as a series of\nheuristics, that have a clear connection with Grice\u2019s maxims of\nquantity and manner:\n\nFirst (Q) Heuristic: What isn\u2019t said, isn\u2019t\n(i.e., what you do not say is not the case)\n\n\nThis is related to Grice\u2019s first maxim of quantity (\u201cMake\nyour contribution as informative as required\u201d) and is held\nresponsible for the inference of so-called scalar implicatures, among\nothers. So from an utterance of \u201cSome students came to the\nparty\u201d it is inferable by default that not all the students\ncame. It is not part of the meaning of \u2018some,\u2019 yet, in\ngeneral \u2014 by default from the utterance-type \u2014 it is what\none would infer in absence of evidence to the contrary. In this case,\nthe heuristic has to be restricted to a set of alternates in a\n\u2018scale,\u2019 so that the use of one implicates the\nnon-applicability of the other.\n\nSecond (I) Heuristic: What is expressed simply is\nstereotypically exemplified\n\n\nThis is related to Grice\u2019s second maxim of quantity (\u201cDo\nnot make your contribution more informative than necessary\u201d),\nand is taken to be involved in cases of interpretation of conditionals\nas bi-conditionals, the enrichment of conjunctions with the expression\nof temporal and causal relations among the conjuncts,\n\u2018bridging\u2019 inferences, collective reading of plural noun\nphrases, and so on.\n\nThird (M) Heuristic: What is said in an abnormal way,\nisn\u2019t normal (i.e., marked message indicates marked situation)\n\n\nThis heuristic is related to Grice\u2019s maxim of manner and,\nspecially, to the first submaxim (\u201cAvoid obscurity of\nexpression\u201d) and the fourth (\u201cAvoid prolixity\u201d). If\naccording to the second heuristic an unmarked utterance gives rise to\na stereotypical interpretation, now we have that this interpretation\nis overruled if a marked utterance is produced. One of the clearest\nexamples is double negation versus simple positive assertion. Compare\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible the plane will be late\u201d with\n\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible that the plane will be\nlate.\u201d\n\nWhen conflict among these three heuristics arise, Levinson argues that\nthese are resolved in the following way: Q defeats\nM, and M defeats I.\n3.4 Border Disputes: Literalists, Minimalists, Contextualists and Others\n\nContemporary philosophical approaches to pragmatics are often\nclassified by their view of the two models discussed in\n Section 3.1.\n \u2018Literalists\u2019 think that semantics is basically\nautonomous, with little \u2018pragmatic intrusion\u2019;\n\u2018contextualists\u2019 adopt the basic outlines of the Relevance\nTheory view of the importance of pragmatics at every level, while\nperhaps demurring on many of the details and the psychological\norientation.\n\nTake, for example, an utterance of \u201cIt is raining\u201d by John\nnow on the CSLI patio in a telephone conversation with Kepa, who is in\nDonostia. John is talking about the weather in Stanford. Arguably,\nwhat John says is that it is raining in Stanford. This is\nwhat he intends for Kepa to understand, and it is the content of the\nbelief, formed by looking at the weather around him, that motivates\nhis utterance. Stanford, then, seems to be a constituent, part of the\nsubject matter, of John\u2019s remark. But how did it get there? It\nseems that it is a matter of pragmatics; it is a fact about\nJohn\u2019s intentions that makes his remark to be about Stanford,\nand that suffices. This is an example of what Perry (1986) calls an\n\u2018unarticulated constituent,\u2019 and an instance of a more\ngeneral phenomenon we will call \u2018unarticulated\ncontent.\u2019\n\nThe same basic choice, about what to do with apparently unarticulated\ncontent that seems to be part of what is said, presents itself in\nconnection with a number of other phenomena: \u2018enriched\u2019\nuses of logical operators and numerals (\u201cMary got married and\n[then] had [exactly] three children\u201d),\nquantifier domain restriction (\u201cNobody [in the class]\nwas paying attention\u201d), comparative adjectives (\u201cJohn is\nshort [for a football player]\u201d), and a long list of\nphenomena reconsidered now as possibly being part of what is said, the\nexplicature or the content of the utterance, rather than part of what\nis implicated.\n\nMost contemporary theorists would acknowledge that in such cases one\nmight describe \u2018what is said\u2019 in terms of the\nunarticulated content: John said that it was raining at\nStanford; the speaker said that Mary got married and\nthen had children, and so forth. And there is general\nagreement that intuitions about \u2018what is said\u2019 cannot by\nthemselves carry much theoretical weight, and there is considerable\ndisagreement about theoretical interpretation of unarticulated\ncontent.\n\nLiteralists argue that the important divide, traditionally marked by\n\u2018what is said,\u2019 should be maintained, although marked by\nnew terminology. Cappelen and Lepore\u2019s (2005) term is\n\u2018semantic content.\u2019 On the near side of semantic content\nwill be only the factors acknowledged by Grice: conventional meaning\nof words and modes of composition; resolution of ambiguity (including,\nperhaps, issues of standards of precision and vagueness), and\nresolution of reference of indexicals, demonstratives and names. On\nthe far side are Gricean implicatures.\n\nAmong literalists, we may distinguish between minimalists and\n\u2018hidden indexical\u2019 theorists. Literalists, do not accept\nany pragmatically determined element in utterance content that is not\ntriggered by grammar, i.e., by a particular context-sensitive element\nin the sentence used. Minimalists try to keep context-sensitive\nexpressions to a minimum and hidden-indexicalists pose a\ncontext-sensitive expression whenever is needed. The latter admit the\n\u2018unarticulated\u2019 content into the proposition literally\nexpressed by the utterance, but hold that it is not\n\u2018really\u2019 unarticulated, since below the surface grammar,\nat some deeper level, say logical form, the sentence provide an\nindexical to be resolved pragmatically (Stanley 2000; Stanley and\nSzabo 2000).\n\nCappelen and Lepore are both literalists and minimalists. They use the\nterm \u2018semantic content\u2019 for propositions determined solely\nby conventions of meaning, precisification, disambiguation and\nreference fixing. They allow that semantic content, so conceived, is\noften not what ordinary speakers would identify as \u2018what is\nsaid\u2019; but they take what is said to be a pragmatic concept, and\nso do not see this as an objection to their scheme. The semantic\ncontent of John\u2019s utterance above, for example, is something\nlike the proposition \u201cRain is occurring,\u201d a relatively\ntrivial proposition, that will be true if it is raining anywhere on\nearth (or perhaps, anywhere in the universe). (See Cappelen and Lepore\n(2007) and Perry (2007).) The triviality of John\u2019s remark,\nliterally interpreted, sets Kepa on the search of some relevant\nproposition he may have meant to convey, and this proposition, that it\nis raining in Palo Alto, is what satisfies our intuitive concept of\n\u2018what is said.\u2019 But that shows only that \u2018what is\nsaid\u2019 is basically a pragmatic concept, that shouldn\u2019t be\nused to delineate true semantic content. We need to change the sign\nfrom \u2018what is said\u2019 to \u2018semantic content,\u2019\nrather than move the boundary to fit the sign. On the near side of\nsemantic content we find only conventional meaning, disambiguation,\nand resolution of reference and vagueness. On the far side we find\nimplicatures, that contribute not only what is suggested, conveyed,\nand the like, but even what is said, as ordinarily conceived.\n\nThose over on the Contextualist side, in contrast, see the level\ncorresponding to Grice\u2019s \u2018what is said\u2019 as\ndetermined not only by semantics, disambiguation and reference-fixing,\nbut also by a number of other pragmatic processes that\n\u2018intrude\u2019 on the near side and enrich semantic content.\nContextualists include relevance theorists and such philosophers as\nRecanati (2004), Travis (1997), Korta and Perry (2006a, 2006b, 2007a,\n2007b, 2008, 2011, 2013) and Neale (2004). Contemporary contextualists\ndo not insist on the term \u2018what is said,\u2019 but provide\nother criteria for the boundary between the proposition more or less\ndirectly expressed and implicatures. Recanati argues that this level\n\u2014 which he sometimes calls \u2018what is\nsaidmax\u2019 in contrast of the \u2018what is\nsaidmin\u2019 of minimalists \u2014 should\nconsist of a proposition that is consciously available to the speaker\nand the proposition he intends to express, and that any planned\nimplications should also be consciously accessible. Cappelen and\nLepore\u2019s proposition would not usually pass this test. In our\nexample, John would not be consciously aware of having expressed a\nproposition that would be true if it was raining on Venus, nor would\nhe at any remotely conscious level have planned for Kepa to reason\nfrom the triviality and irrelevance of the proposition that rain\noccurs to the one he meant to convey, that it rains at Stanford.\n\nIn Korta and Perry\u2019s \u2018Critical Pragmatics\u2019 (2008,\n2011, 2013), the concept of \u2018what is said\u2019 is replaced\nwith two concepts. The \u2018reflexive\u2019 or\n\u2018utterance-bound content\u2019 and the\n\u2018referential\u2019 or \u2018locutionary content\u2019 of an\nutterance. The \u2018utterance-bound content\u2019 is its\ntruth-conditions, as determined by the conventional meanings of the\nwords used and modes of composition, and thus corresponds to the\n\u2018semantically determined content.\u2019 This content will not\nbe the proposition expressed, but rather a set of conditions on the\nutterance and the proposition it expresses, with quantification over\nall relevant factors not determined by meaning \u2014 including\nfactors that resolve ambiguity and reference. At this level, then,\nCritical Pragmatics is radically minimal. For example, an utterance\nu of \u201cElwood touched that woman\u201d will be true\n(roughly) if and only if there is an x and y such\nthat the speaker of u refers to x with\n\u2018Elwood,\u2019 refers to y with \u2018that\nwoman,\u2019 and uses \u2018touches\u2019 with for some action A\npermitted by the conventions of English, and at some time prior to the\ntime of u, x A\u2019ed y. The condition on the utterance\ngiven to the right of the \u2018if and only if\u2019 comprise the\nreflexive content of the utterance. On the other hand, the referential\ncontent of u will be the proposition that, say, Elwood put\nhis hands on Eloise, if the actual facts about u provide\nElwood, Eloise as the referents and putting one\u2019s hands on as\nthe relevant sense of \u2018touches.\u2019 Critical Pragmatics\nemphasizes the speaker\u2019s plan, a hierarchy of intentions, as the\nmain source of the facts that supplement conventional meaning to get\nus from reflexive to incremental meaning.\n\nThe second concept employed to do the traditional work of \u2018what\nis said\u2019 is \u2018locutionary content.\u2019 The\nintended locutionary content is basically the referential\ncontent the speaker intends to express, given her conception of the\ncontext \u2014 that is, roughly, the speaker, time, place and whom\nand what she points at. The locutionary content is fixed by the actual\ncontextual facts, so a speaker\u2019s intended locutionary content\nmay not be the locutionary content of the utterance she produces.\n\nAn intermediate position \u2014 called \u2018syncretic\u2019 by\nRecanati (2004) \u2014 has been subtly defended by Kent Bach (1994,\n1999a, 2001). Bach is on the literalist, minimalist side of the\nspectrum with respect to semantic content (for which he continues to\nuse the term \u2018what is said.\u2019) But he agrees with\ncontextualists that unarticulated contents are not implicatures, and\nare not triggered by the meaning of the sentence uttered. He\nintroduces an intermediate category between what is said, in his\nminimalist sense, and implicatures, which he calls\n\u2018implicitures\u2019 \u2014with \u2018ci\u2019 pronounced as\nin \u2018implicit\u2019 \u2014 to include these elements.\n3.5 A Methodological Flaw of Linguistic Pragmatism?\n\nRecently, the philosopher Michael Devitt (2013) raised an interesting\nissue about an alleged methodological flaw of many, if not most,\napproaches to pragmatics. The flaw consists in conflating the\nmetaphysics of meaning \u2014 the study of what constitutes\nthe meaning of an utterance \u2014 and the epistemology of meaning\n\u2014 the study of how the hearer interprets the meaning of\nan utterance. In his words:\n\nConsider the \u2018meaning-properties\u2019 of an utterance in as\nbroad a sense as you like, cover all its \u2018semantic\u2019 and\n\u2018pragmatic\u2019 properties, in whatever preferred sense. So\nthe properties we are concerned with include conventional properties,\n\u2018what is said\u2019, \u2018what is implicated\u2019, and so\non. [footnote omitted] Now, what constitutes one of those properties\nis one thing, how the hearer discovers the property, another. The\nproperty is constituted by what the speaker does, by the conventions\nshe participates in, the objects she has in mind, or messages she\nintentionally conveys. [footnote omitted] That is where we look for\nthe \u2018metaphysics of meaning\u2019. And what needs emphasizing\nis that none of these meaning-properties is constituted in any way at\nall by what the hearer does in trying to interpret what is said or\nmeant (Devitt, 2013: 288).\n\n\nDevitt attributes the confusion between the metaphysics and the\nepistemology of meaning to most contextualist proposals (or what he\ncalls linguistic pragmatism), such as Bezuidenhout (2002),\nCapone (2012), Carston (2004), Crimmins and Perry (1989), Elugardo and\nStainton (2004), Green (1989), Korta and Perry (2008), Levinson\n(2000), Parikh (2010), Recanati (2004), Sperber and Wilson\n(1986/1995), Saul (2002), Stanley and Szabo (2000) and Taylor (2001).\nThe exceptions, on the other hand, would be Bach (1999a, 2005), Neale\n(2004, 2016) and Fodor and Lepore (2004) (for a recent discussion, see\nthe exchange between Korta and Perry (2019a, 2019b) and Devitt (2019)\nin the Journal of Pragmatics.)\n\nRelevance theory, for example, certainly takes pragmatics to be the\nstudy of the comprehension processes of the utterance on the\npart of the hearer (Sperber and Wilson (1986/1995), Carston (2002),\nWilson and Sperber (2012)). And, as Devitt claims, the study of those\nprocesses should not be confounded with the study of what constitutes\nthe pragmatic properties of an utterance. In this case, however, the\nrelevance-theoretic hearer-oriented perspective seems a matter of\ndeliberate choice rather than a confusion.\n\nFollowing Neale (forthcoming), besides the distinction between the\nmetaphysics and the epistemology of meaning, we should also consider\nformatics: the study of how the speaker forms the plan that\neventually causes the production of her utterance. It is reasonable to\nbe clear about these three approaches, because though different, they\nare closely interconnected. The speaker\u2019s beliefs about the\nhearer\u2019s capability of understanding in the circumstances of the\nutterance may affect, and typically do affect, her formation of\ncommunicative intentions, which, in turn, constrain what she says and\nimplicates. Some approaches combine the three perspectives, and being\nexplicit about their difference may be often welcome.\n\nContemporary pragmatics is a large, active, interdisciplinary field.\nThe work we have considered here merges into important work in logic,\ncomputer science and other areas we have not been able to discuss.\nPhilosophers, the founders of the discipline, continue to play an\nimportant role in this field. Philosophically oriented pragmatists (to\ngive an old term a new meaning) usually consider pragmatic issues with\nan eye towards large issues in the philosophy of language and beyond.\nBut in the course of this, they provide detailed analyses and consider\na wide variety of cases that continue to provide ideas and inspiration\nfor pragmatists from other disciplines. There is formal and\ncomputational pragmatics; theoretical and applied; clinical,\nexperimental pragmatics and even neuropragmatics; there is also\nintercultural. Interlinguistic and intersociocultural pragmatics;\nhistorical pragmatics and history of pragmatics. And this list, as the\nwhole entry, is not exhaustive.\n4. Some Definitions of Pragmatics\n\nMany of the definitions reproduced below contrast pragmatics with\nsemantics.\n\nMorris 1938. Semantics deals with the relation of\nsigns to (\u2026) objects which they may or do denote. Pragmatics\nconcerns the relation of signs to their interpreters.\n\nBy \u2018pragmatics\u2019 is designated the science of the relation\nof signs to their interpreters. (\u2026) Since most, if not all,\nsigns have as their interpreters living organisms, it is a\nsufficiently accurate characterization of pragmatics to say that it\ndeals with the biotic aspects of semiosis, that is, with all the\npsychological, biological, and sociological phenomena which occur in\nthe functioning of signs.\n\nCarnap 1942. If in an investigation explicit\nreference is made to the speaker, or, to put it in more general terms,\nto the user of a language, then we assign it to the field of\npragmatics. (\u2026) If we abstract from the user of the language\nand analyze only the expressions and their designata, we are in the\nfield of semantics. And if, finally, we abstract from the designata\nalso and analyze only the relations between expressions, we are in\n(logical) syntax.\n\nBar-Hillel 1954. I believe, therefore, that the\ninvestigation of indexical languages and the erection of indexical\nlanguage-systems are urgent tasks for contemporary logicians. May I\nadd, for the sake of classificatory clarity, that the former task\nbelongs to descriptive pragmatics and the latter to pure\npragmatics (in one of the many senses of the expression)?\n\nStalnaker 1970. Syntax studies sentences, semantics\nstudies propositions. Pragmatics is the study of linguistic acts and\nthe contexts in which they are performed. There are two major types of\nproblems to be solved within pragmatics: first, to define interesting\ntypes of speech acts and speech products; second, to characterize the\nfeatures of the speech context which help determine which proposition\nis expressed by a given sentence. \u2026 It is a semantic problem to\nspecify the rules for matching up sentences of a natural language with\nthe propositions that they express. In most cases, however, the rules\nwill not match sentences directly with propositions, but will match\nsentences with propositions relative to features of the context in\nwhich the sentence is used. Those contextual features are part of the\nsubject matter of pragmatics.\n\nKatz 1977. [I] draw the theoretical line between\nsemantic interpretation and pragmatic interpretation by taking the\nsemantic component to properly represent only those aspects of the\nmeaning of the sentence that an ideal speaker-hearer of the language\nwould know in an anonymous letter situation,(\u2026) [where there\nis] no clue whatever about the motive, circumstances of transmission,\nor any other factor relevant to understanding the sentence on the\nbasis of its context of utterance.\n\nGazdar 1979. PRAGMATICS = MEANING \u2014 TRUTH\nCONDITIONS. What we need in addition is some function that tells us\nabout the meaning of utterances. (\u2026) The domain of this\npragmatic function is the set of utterances, which are pairs of\nsentences and contexts, so that for each utterance, our function will\nreturn as a value a new context: the context as changed by the\nsentence uttered. (\u2026) And we can treat the meaning of the\nutterance as the difference between the original context and the\ncontext arrived at by utterance of the sentence. [This applies to\nonly] a restricted subset of pragmatic aspects of meaning.\n\nKempson 1988. Semantics provides a complete account\nof sentence meaning for the language, [by] recursively specifying the\ntruth conditions of the sentence of the language. \u2026 Pragmatics\nprovides an account of how sentences are used in utterances to convey\ninformation in context.\n\nKaplan 1989. The fact that a word or phrase has a\ncertain meaning clearly belongs to semantics. On the other hand, a\nclaim about the basis for ascribing a certain meaning to a word or\nphrase does not belong to semantics\u2026 Perhaps, because it\nrelates to how the language is used, it should be categorized as part\nof (\u2026) pragmatics (\u2026), or perhaps, because it\nis a fact about semantics, as part of (\u2026)\nMetasemantics.\n\nDavis 1991. Pragmatics will have as its domain\nspeakers\u2019 communicative intentions, the uses of language that\nrequire such intentions, and the strategies that hearers employ to\ndetermine what these intentions and acts are, so that they can\nunderstand what the speaker intends to communicate.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to Philosophy (Fotion\n1995). Pragmatics is the study of language which focuses\nattention on the users and the context of language use rather than on\nreference, truth, or grammar.\n\nThe Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy (Lycan\n1995). Pragmatics studies the use of language in context, and\nthe context-dependence of various aspects of linguistic\ninterpretation. (\u2026) [Its branches include the theory of how]\none and the same sentence can express different meanings or\npropositions from context to context, owing to ambiguity or\nindexicality or both, (\u2026) speech act theory, and the theory of\nconversational implicature.\n\nThe Blackwell Companion to Philosophy (Davies\n1995). The distinction between semantics and pragmatics is,\nroughly, the distinction between the significance conventionally or\nliterally attached to words, and thence to whole sentences, and the\nfurther significance that can be worked out, by more general\nprinciples, using contextual information.\n\nCarston 1999. The decoding process is performed by an\nautonomous linguistic system, the parser or language perception\nmodule. Having identified a particular acoustic stimulus as\nlinguistic, the system executes a series of deterministic grammatical\ncomputations or mappings, resulting in an output representation, which\nis the semantic representation, or logical form, of the sentence or\nphrase employed in the utterance. (\u2026) The second type of\ncognitive process, the pragmatic inferential process (constrained and\nguided by the communicative principle of relevance) integrates the\nlinguistic contribution with other readily accessible information in\norder to reach a confirmed interpretive hypothesis concerning the\nspeaker\u2019s informative intention.\n\nBach 2004. Semantic information is information\nencoded in what is uttered \u2014 these are stable linguistic\nfeatures of the sentence \u2014 together with any extralinguistic\ninformation that provides (semantic) values to context-sensitive\nexpressions in what is uttered. Pragmatic information is\n(extralinguistic) information that arises from an actual act of\nutterance, and is relevant to the hearer\u2019s determination of what\nthe speaker is communicating. Whereas semantic information is encoded\nin what is uttered, pragmatic information is generated by, or at least\nmade relevant by, the act of uttering it.\n5. Glossary\n\nAmbiguity\n\nIn general, an expression is ambiguous if it has more than one\nmeaning. When a word (e.g., \u2018bank\u2019) has multiple meanings,\nwe have lexical ambiguity. A sentence can be ambiguous even if none of\nits words is ambiguous. Sometimes the ambiguity is considered\nsyntactic because the alternative meanings correspond to alternative\nsyntactic configurations (e.g., \u2018Mary saw John with a\ntelescope\u2019). If there is only one syntactic configuration, the\nambiguity is structural (e.g., \u2018Every man admires a\nwoman\u2019). It is not always clear what kind ambiguity is at stake,\nor even if there is any ambiguity at all (Grice\u2019s theory of\nimplicatures and his Ockham\u2019s modified razor had a\ngreat impact on this issue). In any case, ambiguity \u2014 the\nexistence of several meanings for an expression \u2014 should be\ndistinguished from nambiguity (the existence of many\ndifferent bearers of a proper name), from vagueness (meanings with\nunclear boundaries of application), and underdetermination (failure to\nfully specify a meaning). It is usually assumed that resolving\nambiguity is a pragmatic process, involving determining which meaning\nthe speaker intends to be exploiting, although ambiguity itself is a\nsemantic condition.\n\nAttitude report\n\n\u2018Propositional attitude\u2019 is Bertrand Russell\u2019s term\nfor designating mental states with propositional content, conceived as\nrelations between an agent and a proposition. Propositional attitude\nverbs include \u2018believes,\u2019 \u2018wants,\u2019\n\u2018desires,\u2019 \u2018intends\u2019 or \u2018knows\u2019\nand many others \u2014 basically, the core of our vocabulary for\ndescribing minds and language.\n\nSentences like \u2018Kepler thought that the Earth was\nspherical\u2019 embed other sentences \u2014 \u2018the earth was\nspherical\u2019 \u2014 in oblique (or opaque or\nintensional (with an \u2018s\u2019)) contexts. Oblique\ncontexts are not truth-functional. Substituting other true sentences\nfor \u2018the earth was spherical\u2019 will not necessarily\npreserve truth. Moreover, even substituting co-designative terms for\n\u2018the earth\u2019 may not preserve truth. Kepler did not, one\nsupposes, think that Frege\u2019s favorite planet was spherical\n(assuming the earth was Frege\u2019s favorite planet). \n\nAccording to Frege, in such contexts the usual sense of the sentence,\nthe \u2018Gedanke\u2019 or proposition expressed, becomes the\nreference. Since Frege\u2019s \u201c\u00dcber Sinn und\nBedeutung\u201d (1892) and Russell\u2019s \u201cOn Denoting\u201d\n(1905) the study of reports of these attitudes has been one of the\ncentral topics of the philosophy of language, semantics and\npragmatics.\n\nCharacter/Content\n\nSince Kaplan\u2019s work on indexicals and demonstratives, (Kaplan\n1989) it is commonplace to distinguish between the character of an\nexpression and the content of an utterance of an expression. For\nexample, the character of the word \u2018I\u2019 in English\ndoesn\u2019t change from context to context, although the content\ndoes. Knowing the character of a sentence like \u2018I am a\nphilosopher\u2019 doesn\u2019t imply knowing the content of a\nparticular utterance of that sentence; for the latter, you need to\nknow the \u2018semantic\u2019 context of the utterance. Character is\na property of linguistic expressions (types); content is a property of\nutterances \u2014sentences-in-context; tokenings of them.\n\nContext\n\n\u2018Context\u2019 is an all-pervasive term in pragmatics. For some\nauthors \u2018context\u2019 is the defining concept of pragmatics.\nBut many, perhaps too many, different concepts are included under this\nterm.\n\nIn Linguistics, \u2018context\u2019 commonly means the previous and\nsubsequent linguistic material in a given text. In Kaplan\u2019s\nscheme, the context is objective, it comprises the actual basic facts\nabout an utterance: the speaker, time, place, and possible world in\nwhich it occurs. In Stalnaker\u2019s scheme, context is basically\nsubjective: a matter of common ground: that is, shared beliefs that\nserve as common presuppositions for the interpretation of assertions.\nOften the term is used for anything in the indefinitely large\nsurrounding of an utterance, from the intentions of the speaker to the\nprevious topics of conversation to the objects discernible in the\nenvironment.\n\nHere are a number of distinctions that have been made with respect to\nthe concept(s) of context that the reader may find helpful. The list\nis not intended to be exhaustive, mutually exclusive, or to represent\na single coherent view of pragmatic phenomena.\n\nLinguistic context versus extralinguistic context\n\nConsidering the context of an utterance, one of the most intuitive\ndistinctions is between the context as consisting of its previous and\nsubsequent utterances \u2014 the linguistic contexts \u2014 and any\nother extra-linguistic circumstance surrounding the utterance. In the\ncase of ellipsis and anaphoric (and cataphoric) pronouns the\ndesignation is determined, or at least constrained, by the linguistic\ncontext of the utterance, while the designation of deictic\ndemonstratives is fixed by contextual extralinguistic facts.\n\nNarrow versus broad\n\nNarrow context is usually understood as the list of parameters for\nbasic indexicals, parameters that correspond to basic facts about the\nutterance. Speaker, place and time are on almost everyone\u2019s\nlist, as required for the interpretation of \u2018I,\u2019\n\u2018here,\u2019 \u2018now\u2019 and tense. Kaplan adds the\npossible world, for the interpretation of \u2018actual.\u2019\nArguably, every utterance occurs in a world, at a time, in a place,\nand with a speaker. \n\nIn contrast, wide or broad context is understood as all other kinds of\ninformation, in particular, information relative to the\nspeaker\u2019s communicative intention, used for the interpretation\nof \u2018pragmatic aspects\u2019 of the utterance. In Bach\u2019s\nwords:\n\n\n\nWide context concerns any contextual information relevant to\ndetermining the speaker\u2019s intention and to the successful and\nfelicitous performance of the speech act\u2026 Narrow context\nconcerns information specifically relevant to determining the semantic\nvalues of [indexicals]\u2026 (Bach 1999a)\n\n\nBach goes on to say,\n\nNarrow context is semantic, wide context pragmatic.\n\n\nBut on this there would be some disagreement, as many would hold that\ninformation about the speaker\u2019s intentions, and perhaps also\nabout causal and informational chains, ongoing topics of\nconversations, and much else, are needed for semantics.\n\nEpistemic versus doxastic\n\nIt is sometimes assumed, particularly by writers with a psychological\norientation, that, together with speaker\u2019s intentions, it is\nspeaker\u2019s beliefs what determine the content of expressions in\nher utterance, with the issue of the truth (or falsity) of her beliefs\nhaving no relevance. So, belief rather than knowledge is the relevant\nconcept to characterize context. According to this view, there would\nnot be a significant difference between \u2018intending to say\u2019\nand \u2018saying,\u2019 which goes about some truths of intentions\nin general: one usual way of failing to perform an action comes from\nthe falsity of some agent\u2019s belief. This is related to another\npossible distinction between objective and subjective contexts.\n\nObjective versus subjective\n\nThere are a number of cases, however, in which the speaker\u2019s\nbeliefs, even if shared by everyone in the conversation, do not seem\nto determine content. Suppose, for example, that Elwood\u2019s hero\nworship of John Searle has reached such a point that he now takes\nhimself to be John Searle. He introduces himself to the new class of\nStanford graduate students by saying, \u201cI\u2019m John Searle,\nfrom across the Bay.\u201d It seems that even if he and everyone in\nthe conversation believes he is Searle, what he has said is the\nfalsehood that Elwood is John Searle. Or, suppose a group of golfers\nis standing on the small portion of the Stanford golf course that juts\ninto San Mateo County, but none of them realize it. \u201cThe county\nseat of this county is San Jose,\u201d one of them says, for some\nreason or other. He believes he has informed them of the truth that\nthe county seat of Santa Clara County is San Jose, and in fact the\nother members of the foursome learn this fact from what he says.\nNevertheless, many would argue, what he said was false, and only\nfortuitous ignorance led his partners to learn a truth from the\nfalsehood he uttered.\n\nPre-semantic context\n\nPre-semantic context provides information for identifying the\nutterance: which words in which language with which syntactic\nstructure, and with which meanings are being used.\n\nSemantic context\n\nSemantic context comprises those contextual features that determine or\npartly determine the content of context-sensitive expressions. This is\nthe case of pronouns, whose linguistic meanings do more or less\nstrictly constrain but do not determine their designata. Their\nmeanings direct us to the context (linguistic context, in cases of\nanaphoric co-designation; extra-linguistic context in cases of\nindexicals and deictic uses of demonstratives) to look for the\ndesignation of the pronoun. But there are more context-sensitive\nexpressions than indexical, deictic and anaphoric pronouns. Sentence\nmood, for instance, is an indicator of illocutionary point, but it\ndoes not determine the precise illocutionary force of an utterance\nwithout the help of contextual factors. The contribution to\nutterance-content of some particles like \u2018but\u2019 (that,\naccording to Grice, produce \u2018conventional implicatures) are\nanother case in point.\n\nPost-semantic context\n\nThird, there is (or may be) what Perry (2001) calls post-semantic\ncontext. This comprises facts that provide unarticulated\ncontent. For example, the fact that a conversation is about Palo\nAlto may determine, perhaps together with speaker intentions, that the\nstatement \u201cIt is raining,\u201d has the content that it is\nraining in Palo Alto. Arguably, such contextual contributions are not\ntriggered by the meaning-rules of the words used, but more global\nconsiderations. The fact that we usually are talking about rain in a\nparticular place has to do with the nature of rain and the way humans\nare concerned with it and conceptualize the phenomena, rather than the\nsyntax of \u2018rain.\u2019\n\n(Far-side) Pragmatic Context\n\nThis comprises those contextual factors needed to get at (calculate,\ninfer) what is communicated or done in and by saying\nwhat one says. This importantly concerns the speaker\u2019s\nintentions regarding indirect speech acts, implicatures, and\nnon-literal contents. It may also include institutional facts and\nindeed, all sorts of other things relevant to the effects of the\nutterance.\n\nCommunicative intention\n\nCommunicative intention is what characterizes, an action as\ncommunicative. Following Grice\u2019s definition of\nM(eaning)-intention, it is widely agreed that communicative intentions\nhave three particular properties: (i) it is perlocutionary,\nthat is, it is an intention that seeks a mental effect (certain\nbelief(s) or intention(s)) on the part of the addressee; (ii) it is\novert, that is, the speaker wants the addressee to recognize her\ncommunicative intention; and (iii) the satisfaction of a communicative\nintention consists precisely in its recognition by the addressee.\nCommunicative intentions need not be carried out by linguistic means\n(see Clark 2003). In human linguistic communication planning and\ninference processes have a role at least as important as coding and\ndecoding processes. The speaker plans her speech act according to her\ncommunicative intention; the addressee uses, among other sources, the\ninformation decoded to infer (recognize) the speaker\u2019s\ncommunicative intention.\n\nImplicature (conventional, conversational, particularized,\ngeneralized)\n\nGrice distinguished what the speaker says from what she implicates by\nan utterance. The category of implicature refers to what the speaker\nsuggests, implies or communicates beyond what she says. Among\nimplicatures he made a further distinction between conventional,\ngenerated by the conventional meaning of certain words, and\nnon-conventional ones. Within non-conventional implicatures, he\ndistinguished between conversational, affected, among other factors,\nby conversational principles and maxims, and non-conversational. And\nfinally, among conversational implicatures between particularized,\ndepending on particular features of contexts, and generalized ones.\nGrice pointed out that conversational implicatures have the following\nproperties: (i) they are calculable, that is, inferable from, among\nother things, the cooperative principle and the conversational maxims;\n(ii) they are cancelable either explicitly (adding something like\n\u201cbut I did not meant that\u201d) or contextually, by changing\nthe context; and (iii) except those implicatures based on the maxims\nof manner, they are non-detachable, i.e., there is no way of saying\nthe same thing that would not carry the implicature. The last two\nfeatures, cancelability and non-detachability are known as the\n\u2018tests\u2019 for the presence of an alleged implicature.\n\nImplicit/explicit meaning\n\nIn the traditional Gricean picture, \u2018explicit meaning\u2019\ncorresponds to the sentence\u2019s conventional meaning; or to the\nmeaning obtained by the combination of conventional meaning and those\ncontextual aspects required by the conventional meaning; in other\nwords, to the result of sentence conventional\nmeaning+disambiguation+reference fixing, i.e., what is said.\nThe remaining of utterance meaning, in particular presuppositions and\nimplicatures, would be regarded as implicit meaning within the Gricean\npicture. Grice\u2019s categories of conventional implicature and\ngeneralized conventional implicatures, however, pose problems to the\ndistinction between the explicit and the implicit. After Grice, the\nlimits between them are not very clear yet, despite relevance\ntheorists\u2019s notion of \u2018explicature\u2019 or Bach\u2019s\n\u2018impliciture.\u2019\n\nIndexical\n\nTo determine the reference of an indexical expression (that is, to\ndetermine what a speaker is referring to by the utterance of an\nindexical expression), the interpreter must resort to context. This is\nthe most prominent property of indexical expressions: without varying\ntheir meaning, they can change their content from context to context.\nParadigmatic indexical expressions are personal pronouns\n(\u2018I,\u2019 \u2018you,\u2019 \u2018she\u2019\u2026),\ndemonstratives (\u2018this,\u2019 \u2018that\u2019), time and\nplace adverbs (\u2018here,\u2019 \u2018there,\u2019\n\u2018now,\u2019 \u2018yesterday,\u2019\n\u2018tomorrow\u2019\u2026). But indexicality is a more general\nphenomenon: verb tense and aspect point to context for determining the\nrelevant temporal point or interval. The semantic information of some\nindexical expression leaves little room for doubts about what to look\nfor in context: \u2018I\u2019 refers to the speaker,\n\u2018here\u2019 refers to the place the speaker is in,\n\u2018tomorrow\u2019 to the day starting at midnight of the day of\nutterance. These are called \u2018pure\u2019 or\n\u2018automatic\u2019 indexicals, in contrast to\n\u2018discretionary\u2019 indexicals, whose semantic information\ndoes not determine the referent, and it is necessary to appeal to\nspeaker\u2019s intentions to do so (Perry 2001). Indexical\nexpressions have been called \u2018deictic,\u2019 \u2018egocentric\nparticulars\u2019 and \u2018token-reflexive expressions.\u2019\n\nIntention\n\nIt is a kind of mental state, like belief and desire, for example.\nFrom the point of view of the mental cause theory of action,\nintentions cause actions.\n\nBeing caused by an intention distinguishes movements (or absences of\nmovement) which are actions from mere events, and so, among bodily\nmovements, intentional actions from mere reflexes. The object of\nintention can be represented as a proposition representing the\nmovements (she moved her arm on purpose), or as various results\nexpected or hoped for as a result of the movement (she checkmated her\nopponent, and made him cry, on purpose).\n\nIntentionality\n\nThe word \u2018intention\u2019 is relatively unambiguous outside of\nphilosophy. But philosophers use the word \u2018intention\u2019 and\nespecially the adjective \u2018intentional\u2019 to refer to a\nfeature of a class of mental states that includes but is not limited\nto intentions ordinarily understood. This is the property of being\nabout or directed at objects, including not only\nreal concrete objects, but also abstract and fictional objects,\nproperties, and states of affairs. Thus believing that it is\nraining, hoping to get a computer for Christmas, talking\nabout Sherlock Holmes, figuring out the square root of\nsix hundred and twenty five, are all intentional states and\nactivities, as is intending to bake a cake. It is often\nassumed that minds, mental states, have intrinsic intentionality, and\nthat utterances and sentences have only intentionality in a derived\nsense: they have it from the intentionality of the mental state they\nexpress. \n\nIntentionality (with a \u2018t\u2019) should not be confused with\nintensionality (with an \u2018s\u2019). The latter\nis another technical expression of logic and philosophy; intensions\nare opposed to extensions. Russell\u2019s example is that the\nintension of \u2018featherless biped that is not a plucked\nchicken\u2019 is quite different than the intension of \u2018human\nbeing,\u2019 although their extensions are (perhaps) the same.\nExtensions include classes, sets, and functions considered as sets of\nordered pairs and truth-values. Intensions are meaning, rules,\nproperties, functions as ordinarily conceived, and propositions. In\npossible-worlds semantics intensions are often identified\nwith sets of possible worlds or functions that take possible worlds as\narguments. A property, for example, might be identified with a\nfunction from worlds to set of objects (those that have the property\nin the world), and a proposition with a set of worlds (those in which\nit is true). Whether such an identification is meant as a reduction or\nexplanation of intensions as extensions, or simply as a way of\nmodeling intensions as extensions, varies from theorist to\ntheorist.\n\nLiteral/non-literal\n\nSome take this to be a distinction about word meaning. According to\nthis view, beyond their conventional or literal meaning, words can\nhave figurative or non-literal meanings: metaphoric, ironic, metonymic\nmeanings. After the rise of pragmatic studies, the distinction is\nconsidered mostly to be one at the speaker\u2019s meaning level. When\nthe speaker\u2019s meaning is closed to the conventional meaning of\nthe sentence uttered the speaker is said to be speaking literally.\nWhen it departs from conventional meaning is considered non-literal.\nOf course, the distinction is not clear cut: how much must the\nspeaker\u2019s meaning depart from conventional meaning to be\nconsidered as non-literal? Some authors prefer to talk about a\ncontinuum rather than a two-sided distinction.\n\nLocutionary, illocutionary, perlocutionary\n\nIn terms of Austin\u2019s speech act theory these are three main\nlevels to be distinguished in a speech act. Every speech act is an act\nof saying something. This is the locutionary level. Within it\nAustin distinguished three more: the phonetic act (the act of\nproducing some sounds), the phatic act (the act of uttering\nsome words pertaining to the vocabulary of a certain language\norganized according to the rules of its grammar), and the\nrhetic act (the act of using those words with a certain sense\nand reference). But in saying something one does\nsomething. This is the illocutionary level. And, finally,\nby saying something one gets some (intended or unintended)\neffects in the audience. This is the perlocutionary level.\nSearle casts doubt on the distinction between locutionary and\nillocutionary acts, not seeing the necessity of the former category.\nAs it has developed, speech act theory has been almost entirely\ndevoted to study of the illocutionary level.\n\nPerformative utterance\n\nAustin contrasted between statements, traditionally considered as the\nonly utterances with any philosophical importance, with performative\nutterances that would not be considered as being true or false, and\nrather than merely saying something are better considered as acts of\ndoing something. He further distinguished between explicit\nand implicit performative utterances. The first are those whose main\nverb, called \u2018performative verb,\u2019 makes explicit the\nparticular act that the speaker is performing in producing the\nutterance. These verbs usually present a canonical form: (in English)\nthe first person singular in the present active, or the second person\nof the passive. Not all implicit performative utterances can be made\nexplicit through a performative utterance. Following Austin\u2019s\ndiscussion, all utterances end up being performative, so that the\ncontrast between them and statements seems to make no sense any more.\nThe concept of performative utterance was supplanted in the\ndevelopment of speech act theory by the concept of speech act.\n\nSentence\n\nIt is traditionally defined as the (grammatical) complex expression\ncapable of expressing a complete thought or proposition. This\ndefinition is questioned by the assumption that thoughts or\npropositions are expressed by utterances (or speakers). According to\nthe contextualist thesis, no sentence expresses a complete\n(truth-evaluable) proposition; i.e., there are no\n\u2018eternal\u2019 sentences. From the viewpoint of pragmatics,\nsentences can be conceived as utterance-types, resulted from\nabstracting all elements except the linguistic expressions used. The\nissue of what counts as a complete (grammatical) sentence opposed to a\nsub-sentential complex expression pertains to syntax, rather than to\nsemantics or pragmatics.\n\nSpeech act\n\nSpeech acts are communicative acts performed through the oral or\nwritten use of language. Within speech acts, Austin distinguished\namong locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary levels, but speech\nact theory has been devoted almost exclusively to the illocutionary\nlevel, so that \u2018speech act\u2019 and \u2018illocutionary\nact\u2019 are in practice synonymous terms. An elementary speech act\nconsists of a propositional content and an illocutionary force.\nIllocutionary force concerns the act the speaker intends to do in\nperforming the speech act. All illocutionary forces, in Searle\u2019s\nversion of speech act theory, can be grouped into five classes,\naccording to their basic intention or illocutionary point: assertives,\ncommissives, directives, declaratives and expressives. The\nillocutionary force and the propositional content of a speech act\ndetermine its conditions of success and satisfaction.\n\nType-Token\n\n\u2018Alabama\u2019: how many letters does this word have? If we\ncount letter tokens, the answer is 7. If we count letter types, the\nanswer could be 4 (\u2018a,\u2019 \u2018l,\u2019 \u2018b,\u2019\n\u2018m\u2019) or 5 (if we distinguish between capital and small\nletters). If you say \u201cYou are wrong\u201d to me, and I say\n\u201cYou are wrong\u201d to you, we have produced different tokens\nof the same type. Usually tokens are conceived as marks on paper, or\nsounds that travel through space.\n\nTokens can be typed in various ways. We might consider \u201cLife is\nfun\u201d and \u201cLife is fun\u201d as two tokens of the\nsame type, if fonts are not relevant, or different if they are. In\nsemantics and pragmatics, the default way of typing tokens is by the\nsyntax and semantics of the phrases produced according to the language\nused.\n\nAt the time the distinction was made by Peirce (1931\u201358, sec.\n4.537), it was pretty straightforward, with just spoken and written\ntokens to worry about. If I mail you a letter, you see the same token\nI produced. If I speak to you, you hear the same token I produced.\n\nThings are more complicated now. Suppose I send you an email. It seems\nI produce one token on my screen and another of the same type appears\non your screen, with the same content, at least in ordinary cases.\nSimilarly if I send you a recording. The extension of type/token\ndistinction to modern technology is not a settled issue, however.\n\nSo conceived, token are objects, and written tokens, at least, can be\nre-used. A department might have a reusable note, \u201cI am at\nlunch,\u201d that various faculty can put on their doors at different\ntimes. The same token is used; the type is the same, but the content\nchanges from door to door and time to time.\n\nUtterances are usually taken to be intentional acts, and not the\ntokens produced. But some thinkers take utterances to simply be\ntokens. More commonly those who want to emphasize the importance of\ntokens refer to utterances conceived as acts, as a tokening;\na number of writers use this terminology. \n\nUtterance\n\nConceived as acts, utterances have properties that are crucial to\npragmatics. An utterance is most often taken to be a linguistic action\nperformed by a certain speaker in a certain place at a certain moment.\nIt has, then, the ontological status of actions: each utterance is a\nunique historical event; it is a token, not a type; an utterance made\nby one speaker cannot be made by another one; an utterance made here\nand now cannot be made there later. In Linguistics,\n\u2018utterance\u2019 is often used for the action of pronouncing\norally a sentence, but philosophers tend to also include writing,\nsigning, and other modes of language use, and for the action of using\na sub-sentential expression. It is the view of many but not all\npragmatists that the primary bearers of truth-conditional contents are\nutterances, not sentences; or, even better, that truth-conditional\ncontents or propositions are expressed by the speakers who utter\nsentences, not by the sentences themselves. Utterances of declarative\nsentences are called \u2018statements.\u2019",
