    "main_text": "The Economics of Public Goods and the Public-Goods Problem || Responses to the Public-Goods Problem\n3.2 Responses to the Public-Goods Problem\n\nMany economists regard the public-goods problem as a justification for\nadvocating coercive government action (e.g., Sidgwick 1901; Pigou 1920\n[1932]; Samuelson 1954). The argument actually goes back to the\norigins of economics. In Book 5 of the Wealth of Nations,\nAdam Smith listed three functions of government. \u201cThe third and\nlast duty of the sovereign or commonwealth,\u201d Smith says,\n\n\nis that of erecting or maintaining those public institutions and those\npublic works, which, although they may be in the highest degree\nadvantageous to a great society, are, however, of such a nature, that\nthe profit could not repay the expense to any individual or small\nnumber of individuals, and which it therefore cannot be expected that\nany individual or small number of individuals should erect or\nmaintain. (1776: Bk 5, ch. 1)\n\n\nSimilarly, in the nineteenth century John Stuart Mill wrote that:\n\n\n\u2026 it is a proper office of government to build and maintain\nlighthouses, establish buoys, etc. for the security of navigation: for\nsince it is impossible that the ships at sea which are benefited by a\nlighthouse, should be made to pay a toll on the occasion of its use,\nno one would build lighthouses from motives of personal interest,\nunless indemnified and rewarded from a compulsory levy made by the\nstate. (1848 [1963: 968])\n\n\nHowever, it is not easy for the government to estimate the demand for\na given public good and calculate the appropriate level of taxes. If\npreferences were observable, the government could charge each citizen\naccording to their marginal benefit (thereby levying so-called\n\u201cLindahl taxes\u201d), and an efficient equilibrium (the\n\u201cLindahl equilibrium\u201d) would result (Varian 1992: 426;\nRoberts 1974). But preferences can\u2019t be observed. If they\ncan\u2019t, people have an incentive systematically to understate\ntheir reservation prices in the hope that others won\u2019t do the\nsame so they can free-ride on others\u2019 tax contributions. If\neveryone does that, the public good doesn\u2019t get funded\npublicly.\n\nLeif Johansen has argued that the free-riding argument is less\ncompelling than it appears (Johansen 1977). On the one hand, there is\nlittle evidence that people systematically misstate their preferences\nin elections. On the other hand, public goods are produced at rates\nthat are much higher than would be suggested by the free-rider theory,\nwhich assumes that utility is strictly increasing in private\nconsumption. The empirical evidence on these questions will be\nreviewed in\n Section 5\n of this entry.\n\nThere are mechanisms that encourage individuals to reveal their true\nvaluations of the public good. One is the so-called Groves-Clarke\nmechanism (after Groves 1973 and Clarke 1971). Here each individual\nsubmits a bid, which may be positive or negative, and which may or may\nnot reflect the individual\u2019s true value of the public good\n(i.e., the reservation price minus the cost). The public good is\nprovided if and only if the sum of bids is at least zero. Apart from\nthe public good, each individual receives a \u201cside payment\u201d\ncalculated as the sum of all other individuals\u2019 bids (which may\nalso be negative, i.e., a tax).\n\nNo individual has an incentive to misrepresent his or her true values\nunder the Groves-Clarke mechanism. Suppose we change the valuations in\nthe above example so that the public good is now worth \u221224 to\nBob (by adjusting his reservation price to 51). It should still be\nproduced as the sum of valuations remains positive (alternatively, the\nsum of Bob\u2019s and Sally\u2019s reservation prices remains above\nthe cost of producing the public good). Bob does not have an incentive\nto misrepresent his valuation (by bidding below \u221224) because\nwith the transfer of 25 he receives he is still better off than if the\npublic good was not produced. The same is true of Sally. She\u2019ll\nhave to pay a tax of 24 but is still better off than if the public\ngood was not produced. If we lower Bob\u2019s reservation price\nfurther to below \u221225, he would be worse off despite the transfer\nand thus accurately bid the true, low value. Sally, even though she\nwould prefer the public good to be produced in the absence of\ntransfers would also be worse off after paying the tax and therefore\nhas no incentive to overstate her valuation.\n\nThe problem with the Groves-Clarke mechanism is that it is very\nexpensive\u2014large payments are needed in order to induce\nindividuals to bid their correct value. There are alternative\nmechanisms that avoid positive payments but at the expense of\ngenerating social waste (Varian 1992: 428).\n",
