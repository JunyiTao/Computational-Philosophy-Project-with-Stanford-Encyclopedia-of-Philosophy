    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n2. Metaphysics\n\n\nWard reached his metaphysics\u2014a theory of interacting\nmonads\u2014by way of criticism of the two main philosophical\ntendencies of his day, scientific materialism and\n\u2018absolute\u2019 (or \u2018monistic\u2019) idealism. The\ncritique of materialism is developed at considerable length in the\nfirst series of Gifford Lectures, Naturalism and Agnosticism.\nWard observes here that the view of reality as a system of inert\nmaterial particles subject to strict deterministic laws cannot explain\nthe world\u2019s contingency, a fundamental aspect of experienced\nreality that needs to be taken at face value. Moreover, materialism\nfails to provide an adequate ontology for biology, for it cannot\nexplain the emergence of life from lifeless matter. The doctrine is\nalso inconsistent with the latest development of physics, which is\nmoving away from the seventeenth-century, Democritean conception of the\natom as an inert particle\u2014a microscopic, indivisible\n\u2018thing.\u2019\n\n\nWard\u2019s overall conclusion is that materialism is so beset with\ndifficulties that the real question is not whether it is true, but why\nit has come to be believed in the first place. Ward traces the origin\nof this doctrine in a tendency to confound abstractions with concrete\nrealities. At the beginning of inquiry, the scientist is faced with a\nconcrete whole of experience, but takes notice only of some aspects of\nit. This is wholly justified, but errors are likely to be committed if\nhe overlooks the richness of the empirical basis from which his notions\nare derived. He is then apt to \u201cconfound his descriptive\napparatus with the actual phenomena it is devised to describe\u201d\n(1899: Vol. 1, 81). Materialism is the metaphysics of the scientist\nlacking understanding of his own procedure.\n\n\nThese reflections led Ward to the idealistic conclusion that reality\nmust be interpreted \u2018in terms of Mind.\u2019 Absolute\nidealism\u2014the then widespread view that reality is a cosmic\nconsciousness or single \u2018Experience\u2019\u2014will not do, for\nWard regards it as explanatorily vacuous. The theory that the world of\nfinite things is but the \u2018appearance\u2019 of the One does\nnothing to make the nature of the world more intelligible. Why does the\nOne appear in the way it does? And why does it have to appear at all?\nThese questions find no answer in the works of great monistic thinkers\nsuch as Spinoza and Hegel, nor do their British followers do any better\nin this respect. Ward substantiates this claim with a quotation from\nBradley\u2019s Appearance and Reality (1893), where he admits\nthat the \u2018fact of fragmentariness,\u2019 that is, why the One\nappears in the form of a multiplicity, cannot be explained.\n\n\nThe upshot of these two parallel lines of arguments\u2014the\ncritique of materialism and Absolute idealism\u2014is that some form\nof pluralistic idealism must be true. And it is only natural at this\npoint to turn to Leibniz, and especially so for a thinker so well\nacquainted with German philosophy. According to Ward, however,\nLeibniz\u2019s metaphysics needs to be amended in one fundamental\nrespect:\n\n\n\u2026the well-known Monadology of Leibniz may be taken\nas the type, to which all modern attempts to construct a pluralistic\nphilosophy more or less conform. But the theology on which Leibniz from\nthe outset strove to found his Monadology, is, in the first\ninstance at all events, set aside; and in particular his famous\ndoctrine of pre-established harmony is rejected altogether. (1911:\n53\u201354)\n\n\nWard\u2019s main crux is that pre-established harmony fails to\nleave any room open for contingency and genuine novelties. In\nLeibniz\u2019s system, evolution can only be interpreted as\n\u2018preformation,\u2019 the gradual unfolding of what in a\ncompressed form is already present at the beginning. This is\ninconsistent with a correct understanding of evolution, which involves\n\u2018epigenesis\u2019\u2014the coming into being of unexpected\nfacts.\n\n\nInterestingly, the same criticism is advanced against philosophies\nsuch as Hegel\u2019s that conceives of natural history as the\n\u2018externalization\u2019 of a primordial \u2018Idea.\u2019 Ward\nnotices, however, that Hegel\u2019s description of nature\u2014as\n\u2018a bacchantic God\u2019 (148), and as providing \u2018the\nspectacle of a contingency that runs out into endless detail\u2019\n(139)\u2014is insightful and wholly in line with his own; indeed, he\ngoes so far as to say that \u2018there is a strong undercurrent of\n[Leibnizian] pluralism running through the whole of Hegel\u2019s\nphilosophy.\u2019 (159)\n\n\nPart of Leibniz\u2019s motivation for holding to pre-established\nharmony was the alleged impossibility of making sense of\ntranseunt causation\u2014that is, causation understood as a\ndirect relation between distinct monads (as opposed to\nimmanent causation, which holds between successive stages of a\nmonad\u2019s life). If direct interaction is impossible, how to\naccount for the correlations between things except by assuming that it\nhad been established by a supreme Architect? In the hands of Leibniz,\nthis surprising view as to the nature of causation becomes the\nfoundation of an original proof of God\u2019s existence.\n\n\nWard attacks Leibniz\u2019s reasoning at its very basis. Causal\ninteraction was understood by Leibniz in terms of the doctrine of\nphysical influx. On that model, direct causal interaction is\nrejected because properties cannot exist unless as inhering in\nsubstances; in passing from one substance to another, however, the\ncommunicated property would have to exist in a detached condition,\nwhich seems absurd. Could this simple piece of reasoning suffice to\nreject what we seem to experience all the time, namely our power to act\ndirectly upon external realities and to be immediately affected by\nthem? In his answer to Leibniz, Ward remarks that the theory of\nphysical influx categorizes the terms of a causal relation as\nsubstances to which qualities inhere; on this theory, even the monads\nare therefore conceived as if they were things. This involves a special\nsort of category-mistake: \u2018Monads\u2019\u2014Ward\nsays\u2014\u201care conative, that is are feeling and striving\nsubjects or persons in the widest sense, not inert particles or\nthings\u201d (260).\n\n\nIn other words, since monads are not \u2018things\u2019 but\n\u2018subjects,\u2019 the argument against direct monadic\ninteraction is blatantly invalid. As Ward puts it: \u201cIf the\nLeibnizian assumption, that there are no beings devoid of perception\nand spontaneity\u2026 is otherwise sound, then the objections to\ntranseunt action between things become irrelevant\u201d (219). Hence,\nin a polemical reversion of Leibniz\u2019s famous metaphor, he concludes\nthat \u2018all monads have windows\u2019 (260).\n",
