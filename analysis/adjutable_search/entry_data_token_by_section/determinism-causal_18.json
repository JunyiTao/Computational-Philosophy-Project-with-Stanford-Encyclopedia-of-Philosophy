    "main_text": "Chance and Determinism\n6. Determinism and Human Action\n\nIn the introduction, we noted the threat that determinism seems to\npose to human free agency. It is hard to see how, if the state of the\nworld 1000 years ago fixes everything I do during my life, I can\nmeaningfully say that I am a free agent, the author of my own actions,\nwhich I could have freely chosen to perform differently. After all, I\nhave neither the power to change the laws of nature, nor to change the\npast! So in what sense can I attribute freedom of choice to\nmyself?\n\nPhilosophers have not lacked ingenuity in devising answers to this\nquestion. There is a long tradition of\n compatibilists\n arguing that freedom is fully compatible with physical determinism; a\nprominent recent defender is John Fischer (1994, 2012). Hume went so\nfar as to argue that determinism is a necessary condition for\nfreedom\u2014or at least, he argued that some causality principle\nalong the lines of \u201csame cause, same effect\u201d is required.\nThere have been equally numerous and vigorous responses by those who\nare not convinced. Can a clear understanding of what determinism is,\nand how it tends to succeed or fail in real physical theories, shed\nany light on the controversy?\n\nPhysics, particularly 20th century physics, does have one\nlesson to impart to the free will debate; a lesson about the\nrelationship between time and determinism. Recall that we\nnoticed that the fundamental theories we are familiar with, if they\nare deterministic at all, are time-symmetrically deterministic. That\nis, earlier states of the world can be seen as fixing all later\nstates; but equally, later states can be seen as fixing all earlier\nstates. We tend to focus only on the former relationship, but we are\nnot led to do so by the theories themselves.\n\nNor does 20th (21st) century physics countenance\nthe idea that there is anything ontologically special about the past,\nas opposed to the present and the future. In fact, it fails to use\nthese categories in any respect, leading some philosophers to argue\nthat they are merely perspectival and, in a physical sense,\n illusory.[10]\n So there is no support in physics for the idea that the past is\n\u201cfixed\u201d in some way that the present and future are not,\nor that it has some ontological power to constrain our actions that\nthe present and future do not have. It is not hard to uncover the\nreasons why we naturally do tend to think of the past as special, and\nassume that both physical causation and physical explanation work only\nin the past present/future direction (see the entry on\n thermodynamic asymmetry in time).\n But these pragmatic matters have nothing to do with fundamental\ndeterminism. If we shake loose from the tendency to see the past as\nspecial, when it comes to the relationships of determination, it may\nprove possible to think of a deterministic world as one in which each\npart bears a determining\u2014or partial-determining\u2014relation\nto other parts, but in which no particular part (region of space-time,\nevent or set of events, ...) has a special, privileged determining\nrole that undercuts the others. Hoefer (2002a), Ismael (2016), and\nLoewer (2020, Other Internet Resources) use such considerations to\nargue in distinct but closely related ways for the compatiblity of\ndeterminism with human free agency.\n",
