    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind || Theory of Intentionality\n2.1 Theory of Intentionality\n\nThe contributions of the Munich and G\u00f6ttingen circles to the\ntheory of intentionality generally converge on the idea that there are\nmany primitive kinds of of-ness or about-ness, which are radically\ndifferent from each other. This idea can be claimed to conflict with\nHusserl\u2019s theory of intentionality as presented in his\nLogical Investigations: on a plausible interpretation of\nHusserl\u2019s theory, \u201cobjectifying\u201d acts (acts like\nthinking, perceiving, and imagining) come in several kinds, but they\nare all intentional in exactly the same sense, since they all\ninstantiate the very same essence (accordingly, kinds of objectifying\nacts are \u201cspecies\u201d of the genus of\n\u201cintention\u201d, or \u201cintentional act\u201d, Hua XIX\n380f, 432f, 625f). In what follows, the assumption of radically\ndifferent kinds of intentionality is discussed in connection with two\nimportant distinctions drawn by early phenomenologists. The first,\nbroached in\n \u00a72.1.1,\n holds between acts of \u201cmeaning\u201d something and acts of\npresenting something (e.g., acts of perception or imagination). The\nsecond, which is the topic of\n \u00a72.1.2,\n contrasts the cognitive acts discussed in \u00a72.1.1 with the\ndoxastic, affective, or conative attitudes (position-takings or\nstances) that a subject can adopt towards objects and facts.\n2.1.1 Meaning Acts and Presentations\n\nEarly phenomenology associates (or even simply identifies) the notion\nof thinking with that of Meinen (literally: \u201cto\nmean\u201d, hereafter \u201cmeaning something\u201d or\n\u201cmeaning act\u201d, Mulligan 2011). Meinen is a\nspecific kind of intentional act, which is claimed to differ\nfundamentally from presentation (presentations are intuitive\nexperiences like perception or imagination). The focus on meaning acts\nis found throughout the entire history of the two circles (Mulligan\n2011, 2012): despite differences in the details, early\nphenomenologists share a basic understanding of this concept.\n\nAlexander Pf\u00e4nder is perhaps the first phenomenologist who, in\nhis Phenomenology of the Will (1900), extensively discusses\nthe notion of meaning something (Schuhmann 2004a). He originally\ndescribes this act as a presentation (Vorstellung), which is\nnon-intuitive. According to this initial view, to mean something is to\npresent (vorstellen) a (representing) content that\nsymbolically (i.e., by means of a similarity or depictive relation,\n1900: 25ff, see also Fischer 1905) refers to another (represented)\ncontent. For instance, you mean the Eiffel Tower, when you form a\nmental image (a representing content) of the Eiffel Tower (the\nrepresented content). Pf\u00e4nder\u2019s position would rapidly\nevolve in the following years, though. In a talk given at\nMunich\u2019s Society for Psychology in 1898, he recognizes that\npresentations are always intuitive (anschaulich), whereas\nmeaning acts do not have intuitive content. In this context,\nPf\u00e4nder gives the example of someone attending a lecture (1898:\n61): if you understand the speaker, then you mean the same objects the\nspeaker means or talks about. This act of meaning something should be\ndistinguished from the act of presenting the words uttered by\nthe speaker: the words are intuitively given to you, but their\nreferents are not (or, at least, they are not required to be\nintuitively given in order for you to mean them). Therefore, the way\nin which you are directed to (or: you mean) the referents is different\nfrom the way in which you are directed to (or: you present) the words.\nPresenting something\u2014but not meaning something\u2014always\nrequires the intuitive presence of their objects (either in perception\nor imagination). Pf\u00e4nder develops this position in later works by\nincreasingly emphasizing the differences between presenting and\nmeaning something (see 1911a: 135). Contrary to his initial position\nof 1900, he then comes to consider the latter experience as an act\nof its own kind and no longer as a kind of presentation\n(1913, 19): the concept of a non-intuitive presentation is eventually\nheld to be a contradiction in terms (1921: 140; 1933: 21f), and\nmeaning acts, being defined by complete lack of intuitive content, are\ndescribed as referring to an object only in a linguistic way (1973:\n153). This last feature licenses the label of \u201cthinking\u201d\nas applied to meaning acts (or, at least, as one kind of thinking\namong others like questioning, conjecturing, assuming, inferring,\netc., see 1921: 145f; 1933: 21).\n\nPf\u00e4nder\u2019s early positions provide the basis for a series of\narguments that Reinach develops in his 1911 paper On the Theory of\nNegative Judgment to illustrate that meaning something is an act\nof its own kind that is fundamentally different from presentation.\nReinach, too, seems to understand the notion of meaning something as\ninterchangeable with that of thinking (1908a [1989: 339f]; 1913a\n[1989: 419], but see Mulligan 2011: 266 for a different\ninterpretation). The broader sense of \u201cthinking\u201d, which is\nequivalent to that of \u201cmeaning something\u201d, is contrasted\nwith a narrower one, which restrictedly points to those acts that are\ndirected towards ideal or abstract objects only (1911a [1989: 104]).\nReinach also operates with a broader notion of presentation, which\nencompasses all acts that secure intuitive access to their objects:\nthis notion includes sensual and categorial perceptions, imaginations,\n\u201cpresentifications\u201d (i.e., the act of making\n\u201cpresent\u201d an object in consciousness), etc. (1911a [1989:\n101]).\n\nAccording to Reinach, a number of properties characterize acts of\nmeaning in contradistinction to presentations (1911a [1989: 102ff]).\nIn particular, meaning something is an intrinsically linguistic act,\nwhilst presentations are not linguistic (1911a [1989: 104]). This is\nconducive to the idea that, whereas presentations are defined in terms\nof experiences that enable an intuitive access to the object, meaning\nacts are \u201cblind\u201d (1911a [1989: 119]): if one means an\nobject, no intuitive aspect of the object becomes present in virtue of\nthe fact that this object has been meant. Reinach notes that this has\nconsequences for how these acts relate to time. The objects of\npresentations, being intuitively present, stand \u201cin front\nof\u201d the mind in corresponding acts of perception, imagination,\npresentification, etc. It is therefore possible for these acts to\nextend in time for as long as the object stands in front of the mind.\nBy contrast, meaning acts are \u201ctemporally punctual\u201d in the\nsense that to mean something is an act that does not last in time:\nthis is why it would make no sense to ask the subject how long it took\nher to mean a certain object (Chrudzimski 2015: 289). Reinach\ncomplements these ideas by developing an additional argument that\nturns out to be crucial for the phenomenological understanding of\nmeaning acts.\n\nReinach ponders whether the distinction between meaning acts and\npresentations could be traced back to the one introduced by Husserl in\nhis Logical Investigations between acts that lack intuitive\ncontent and acts that are intuitively fulfilled. Roughly,\nHusserl\u2019s idea is that objectifying acts either are\nintuitions because they bear intuitive content\u2014in the case of\nperceptions, this content is saliently made of sensations (these being\nmental experiences that are not intentional). Or they are\nthinking acts (\u201cmeaning-intentions\u201d or\n\u201csignifications\u201d) because they lack such content. Husserl\nclaims that objectifying acts can be more or less intuitively\nfulfilled, which entails the idea that the intuitive content typically\ncomes in degrees: if the act has a maximum of intuitive content, then\none faces a so-called \u201cpure intuition\u201d, in which\n\n\nno part, no side, no property of its object fails to be intuitively\npresented [\u2026], none is merely indirectly co-meant\n[mitgemeint]. (Hua XIX 611, Eng. trans. mod., 236)\n\n\nBy contrast, if the intentional act is empty, then it is a thinking\nact. In addition, if an intuition and a thinking act are directed to\nthe same object in the same sense, they can \u201cfuse\u201d, to the\neffect that the intuition can be said to intuitively fulfill the empty\nact. Note one important implication of this view: since the presence\nof intuitive content is not essential for the act to be an\nobjectifying act, every such act either is a signification or is\nalways co-constituted by a signification. (It should not go\nunmentioned that Husserl modifies his view about this issue by arguing\nin later works that intuitions are not co-constituted by thinking\nacts, see Hua XVI \u00a717; Hua XX/I, 85\u201398; Melle 2002.)\n\nReinach grants that a presentation can be more or less intuitively\nfulfilled, but he also emphasizes that the act\u2019s component,\nwhich is fulfilled by the intuitive content, is not a meaning\nact (1911a [1989: 105]). In addition, Reinach again grants that the\nsubject can simultaneously present an object and mean this very same\nobject. However, he also maintains that in this case the two acts do\nnot relate to each other in any essential way:\n\n\nthis identity of reference point of the two acts cannot sanction the\nidentification of the acts themselves, i.e., by allowing the\ndissolution of the punctual act of meaning within [sic] the\nstretched-out act of presentation. (1911a [1989: 103] [1982: 324])\n\n\nIn other words, Reinach contends that, although the objectual\ncorrelates of both acts can coincide, meaning acts cannot enter a\nrelation of fulfillment with presentations (or with intuitions in\nHusserl\u2019s sense), i.e., they cannot fuse (1911a [1989: 106], on\nthis, also see Salice 2012).\n\nPut differently, meaning acts, insofar as they are essentially\n\u201cblind\u201d, simply cannot have intuitive content. Although\nsuch contents, sometimes, can \u201caccompany\u201d meaning acts,\nthey operate as mere accessories for they\n\n\ndo not \u201cexhibit\u201d or \u201cpresent\u201d\nanything\u2014for of course in the sphere of meaning there is\nabsolutely nothing to hand which is presented. (1911a [1989: 106]\n[1982: 328]; see also Gallinger 1914: 36 who operates with this idea\nin his investigation of memory)\n\n\nThus, intuitive contents are not and cannot be present in meaning acts\nand, if these acts did have such contents, they would not qualify as\nmeaning acts, but as presentations (this argument is developed by\nReinach in explicit contrast to Husserl in 1908a [1989: 339]).\nConversely, while meaning acts are always \u201cempty\u201d (or,\nmore precisely, they do not show anything like the dichotomy of\nemptiness/fullness), it is \u201cvery questionable whether there\nexist absolutely intuition-free presentations\u201d (1911a [1989:\n106] [1982: 329]).\n\nReinach\u2019s line of argument suggests that presentations and\nmeaning acts are directed to objects and states of affairs in two\nradically different ways: if these acts were directed towards their\ncorrelate in the same way, they would share the same essence and,\nthus, they could fuse. To put this differently, the\n\u201cof-ness\u201d of presentations does not coincide with the\nintentionality of intentions or meaning acts. This\ndistinction is terminologically fixed by Conrad, who in his 1911\nessay, Perception and Presentation (An Essential\nComparison), further explores Reinach\u2019s view and reserves\nthe expression \u201cIntentionalit\u00e4t\u201d to the\ndirectedness of meaning acts (1911: 64 fn) while qualifying\npresentations as the consciousness of an object or\nof a thing.\n\nAs we have seen, the intentionality of meaning something, in contrast\nto the of-ness of presentations, requires linguistic signs (see also\nConrad 1910, Schm\u00fccker 1956, Fabbianelli 2015). This idea is\nfurther investigated by Herman Ritzel in his dissertation of 1914\n(published 1916) where the distinction between meaning acts and\npresentations is articulated in an original way. Ritzel endorses\nReinach\u2019s idea that presentations require the intuitive presence\nof the object, whereas meaning something does not (1916: 35), but he\ndevelops this view by claiming that meaning acts and presentations\ndiffer in kind because they correlate to objects of different kinds.\nWhereas presenting directly points at objects, meaning linguistically\npoints at concepts, and it is by means of concepts that meaning acts\ncan be said to refer to objects (1916: 48f).\n\nRitzel\u2019s proposal aligns with the idea, quite generally embraced\nby early phenomenologists, that presentations are non-conceptual,\nwhereas Meinen is essentially conceptual. However, it also\nstands out for the following reason: Ritzel claims that, when it comes\nto meaning acts pointing at \u201cempirical concepts\u201d (an\nexpression he adopts from Kant to express concepts based on sensorial\nexperience, see Critique of Pure Reason A50/B74; 1916: 22),\nsemantic reference works in the same way in which, on John Stuart\nMill\u2019s view, proper names denote individuals: just as proper\nnames directly refer to individuals, so do \u201c[empirical concepts]\ndenote [nennen] their object directly [in direkter\nWeise]\u201d (1916: 17). More precisely, what both cases have in\ncommon is that meanings of proper names or of terms of empirical\nconcepts change if the objects they denote change. That is, the\ncontent of an empirical concept is identical with the kind that the\nconcept refers to. In contrast to the traditional view about concepts,\nin these cases, it is not the intension (the content) of a concept\nthat determines its extension, but rather the extension that\ndetermines the intension. On this point, Ritzel seems to anticipate\nthe theory of direct reference and rigid designators (see Sowa 2007:\n97).\n\nThe contributions of Pf\u00e4nder, Reinach, and Ritzel (among others)\nsupport a statement made by Conrad in his last publication according\nto which phenomenologists in G\u00f6ttingen rejected Husserl\u2019s\nclaim that intentionality is the essential characteristic of\nperception and presentation (1968: 3). Indeed, despite differences in\nthe details, the idea that intentionality is not a general, but a\nspecific property that characterizes only a given kind of experience\n(acts of meaning something) seems to have been a widely endorsed view\namong early phenomenologists: authors like Daubert (see Schuhmann\n& Smith 1985: 784\u2014on Daubert\u2019s view in relation to the\nnature of intentionality, see also Bower 2019), Geiger (1911a: 125,\n139), Stavenhagen (1925: 164f; 1933: 38), or Brunswig (1910: 64f)\nmention this idea in their publications often without feeling the need\nto offer further justification. However, not all early\nphenomenologists concurred on this view: some of them refused certain\nimplications of it, others refused the view altogether.\n\nKarelitzki, for instance, sides with Reinach and Conrad when it comes\nto distinguishing meaning from presentation, but he rebuts their\ncentral point that meaning is always blind, i.e., that it can never\nget sight of the object (1914: 33f). Karelitzki argues that, although\nmeaning is generally blind, it does not have to be so: he presents an\nexample in which someone asks the question \u201cwhat do you mean\nwith\u2026?\u201d and the addressee of the question gives a\ncharacterization of what was meant, hence bringing the meaning act\nstep by step closer to what Karelitzki calls the \u201cessence\u201d\nof the meant object (1914: 36).\n\nOther voices within the groups maintained, in line with Husserl, that\nthinking and intuition can fuse together. This idea is advocated by\nSchapp (1910), Hofmann (1913) and Leyendecker (1913), who apply it to\nthe phenomenology of perception, and by Heinrich, who presupposes it\nin his work on concepts (1910). For instance, Schapp holds that, in\nperception, intuitive contents and ideas (or concepts) can only be\nseparated conceptually, but not factually: without ideas, we cannot\nperceive things (1910: 133f). Although Hofmann was critical towards\nthe existence of sensations (the first chapter of his 1913 essay is a\ncritique of this notion), he nonetheless puts Husserl\u2019s concept\nof apprehension at the core of perception (as does Ingarden, see his\n1997: 15ff): in apprehension, a subject \u201cinterprets\u201d an\nintuitive content by means of a conceptual content (but see Mulligan\n1995 for a different interpretation). According to Hofmann, perception\nis apprehension, even though the apprehended contents are not mere\nsensations, but structured \u201csight or visual things\u201d\n(Sehdinge, see Hofmann 1913: 82; on the notion of\nSehding, see Casati 1994). Furthermore, Leyendecker\ninvestigated the phenomenon of cognitive penetrability and various\nways in which perception is permeable to thinking by discussing a\nlarge number of perceptual situations including various kinds of\nillusions, selective perception, the experience of\n\u201coverlooking\u201d something, etc.\n2.1.2 Attitudes: Doxastic, Affective, Conative.\n\nOne important idea secured by early-phenomenological discussions about\npresentations and acts of meaning something is that, in acts of the\nfirst kind, the subject is acquainted with or simply has the object in\na purely receptive or passive sense (rezeptives Haben, see\nvon Hildebrand 1916: 134; Pf\u00e4nder 1911a: 167f; Reinach 1911a\n[1989: 102]; Karelitzki 1914: 35, among others). This is why the broad\nfamily of presentations are sometimes called \u201ccognitions\u201d\n(Kenntnisnahmen, literally: the experience of \u201ctaking\nnote of something\u201d, von Hildebrand 1916: 139ff). The receptive\nway in which the subject relates to the object in presentations is\ncontrasted with an active one: once the subject has the object in\ncognition, she can adopt an attitude (a position or a stance,\nStellungnahme) towards that object (Reinach 1911a [1989:\n109f]; von Hildebrand 1916, Stavenhagen 1925). Phenomenologists\ngenerally agree on the idea that, based on one\u2019s cognitions, a\nsubject can form attitudes of a doxastic, affective, or conative\nnature. Another way of formulating this idea is that cognitions\n\u201cfound\u201d attitudes, where \u201cfounding\u201d expresses\nexistential (one-sided) dependence: attitudes would not exist without\ncognitions, but not vice versa. One way to understand the\nreceptive/active distinction is that attitudes can be made subject to\na specific sense of the \u201cwhy?\u201d question (Uemura &\nSalice 2019): if you believe that p, feel a certain emotion about\np, or want that p, you put yourself under the rational demand\nof providing reasons for your attitudes. The remainder of this\nsubsection summarizes early phenomenology\u2019s main ideas about\nthese three kinds of attitudes.\n\nDoxastic attitudes. Suppose you perceive a child falling on\nthe street. In this perception, you have cognized a given state of\naffairs, but you have not yet adopted any doxastic position towards\nthat state of affairs. You do that when you form the positive belief\nthat a child is falling on the street. The distinction between\nperception and beliefs can be easily overlooked and is illustrated\nmost clearly by scenarios involving optical illusions. For instance,\nin the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion, your perception that the two\nsegments are of different length is clearly different from your belief\nthat they are of equal length.\n\nBeliefs are a member of the family of doxastic attitudes, together\nwith assumptions, conjectures, convictions, etc. Beliefs are states:\nthey endure in time and, in their dispositional form, they can endure\nfor a very long period of time (your belief, say, that Rome is the\ncapital of Italy lasts for years). Also, they are polar attitudes: a\nbelief is either positive or negative. For instance, the positive\nbelief that the segments are of the same length in the\nM\u00fcller-Lyer illusion has, as its counterpart, the negative belief\n(or disbelief) that they are of the same length. And that disbelief\nshould be distinguished from the positive belief that they are\nnot equal in length. Finally, beliefs come in degree: your\nbelief that p is the case can be more or less firm. These\nproperties show why beliefs, even when true and justified, ought to be\ndistinguished from \u201capprehension\u201d (or the act of\n\u201ccoming to know something\u201d, Erkennen, Mulligan\n2014: 381). For instance, suppose that you perceive a moving object\nfrom afar and that, at some point, you realize that it is a cyclist:\nin this case, you have come to know a certain fact. Coming to know\nthat p does not endure, it is temporally punctual. Also, coming to\nknow that p does not have a polar opposite. And finally, this act\ndoes not come in degree: you either know that p or do not. It also\nmerits attention that, while cognitions can found belief and\napprehension, and while apprehension can found beliefs, beliefs can\nfound neither apprehension nor cognitions: this makes apprehension\nmore fundamental than beliefs in our psychological architecture\n(Reinach 1911a [1989: 118]; von Hildebrand 1950: 5\u201311; Scheler\n1915: 222f). Partly also because of these considerations, some\ncommentators have identified the epistemology developed by early\nphenomenologists as a precursor of the \u201cknowledge first\nview\u201d (Mulligan 2014).\n\nAffective Attitudes. Suppose further that you not only\nperceive the child falling on the street, but you also become\nacquainted with the negative (dis-)value of the child falling on the\nstreet. In this case, you could emote according to that disvalue by\nfeeling disquiet about or concern for the child. This example\nillustrates two further insights about our mental life secured by\nearly phenomenology. First, it illustrates the possibility of becoming\nacquainted with value-properties: these are higher-order properties\nlike being dangerous, beautiful, elegant, morally blameworthy,\npleasurable, commendable, etc., which supervene on properties of other\nkinds, but do not reduce to them. The specific kind of act that gives\naccess to value-properties is called by phenomenologists\n\u201cfeeling\u201d (F\u00fchlen) (see Brunswig 1910: 182;\nGeiger 1928: 36f; Reinach, 1912/13 [1989: 295\u2013301]; von\nHildebrand 1916: 203ff, Pf\u00e4nder 1933: 24; Scheler 1913/16: 271f;\non this notion, see also Mulligan 2010: 235f). Even if affectively\ncolored, feeling is not an affective attitude, but belongs to the\nfamily of presentations or cognitions and thus shares the main\nfeatures exemplified by acts of this kind. In particular, this act\nsecures a receptive, non-conceptual, and intuitive access to\nvalue-properties. Interestingly, feeling\u2019s sensitivity can be\ncultivated through time: this enables subjects to better discriminate\nvalues and, thereby, to achieve epistemic excellence in the\nappreciation of the goods that exemplify values (see Schapp 1930:\n11f).\n\nSecond, the example also indicates that, when confronted with facts or\nobjects and their values, one can also adopt an affective position\ntowards those correlates: when one feels emotions towards them, one\naffectively responds to them (see von Hildebrand 1916: 134f;\nBrunswig 1911: 47; Reinach 1912/13 [1989: 295ff]; Scheler 1913/16:\n267ff; on the early phenomenological conception of emotions and its\ndevelopment, see Vendrell Ferran 2008; M\u00fcller 2019; Szanto &\nLandweer 2020). The distinction between the cognitive act of feeling\nvalues and emotions is illustrated by the possibility of a\nsubject\u2019s grasping the value-property of something by,\nnonetheless, remaining affectively inert towards it (von Hildebrand\n1916: 200f): e.g., it is possible to observe a moral wrongdoing\nwithout eliciting indignation or to perceive a commendable action\nwithout admiring it. In this case, the act of feeling has not\ntriggered an emotive response towards it. The value-property, which in\ncontemporary debates on emotions is also called the emotion\u2019s\n\u201cformal object\u201d (Kenny 2003), is the condition of fit of\nthe emotion: an emotion is fit or warranted if it tracks a\nvalue-property.\n\nAffective phenomena are variegated and multifarious. One of the most\nsophisticated accounts is developed by Scheler, who distinguishes four\nkinds of affective phenomena or feelings (Gef\u00fchle, the\nGerman term equally applies to bodily feelings and emotions):\n\nsensible feelings like pleasure or displeasure deriving, e.g.,\nfrom eating food;\nvital feelings (Vitalgef\u00fchle), which affect body\n(Leibgef\u00fchle) or life (Lebensgef\u00fchle):\nthey include feeling sick, feeling old, feeling tired, vigour,\netc.;\nmental or psychic feelings (seelische Gef\u00fchle) like\nhappiness, sadness, sorrow, or grief; and\nspiritual feelings like bliss or despair, etc. (Scheler 1913/16:\n341ff; Mulligan 2008a; Schlo\u00dfberger 2020).\n\n\nThis taxonomy is enriched by other phenomenologists in various ways.\nTo mention but a few lines of investigation: Pf\u00e4nder (1913, 1916)\ndiscusses various kinds of sentiments (Uemura & Yaegashi 2020);\nGeiger (1911b) tackles moods and their intentional correlates\n(Schlo\u00dfberger 2019); Else Voigtl\u00e4nder (1910) offers an\narticulated description of self-conscious feelings and emotions in her\ndissertation (Vendrell Ferran 2020). Interestingly, Scheler claims\nthat his four-part distinction of affective phenomena correlates with\nfour different kinds of values (that are hierarchically ordered,\nScheler 1913/16: 125ff):\n\nthe values of the agreeable and the disagreeable (which occupy the\nlowest level in the hierarchy);\nvital values like weakness, well-being, nobility or\nvulgarity;\naesthetic, moral, and epistemic values; and, finally,\nthe values of the holy and the unholy, which are in the highest\nposition of the hierarchy.\n\n\nConative Attitudes. Conative experiences are the third kind\nof attitudes that attracted substantial attention in early\nphenomenology (see Pf\u00e4nder 1900, 1911a, 1913, 1916; von\nHildebrand 1916; Scheler 1913/16, esp. 141ff; Reinach 1912/13, and\nReiner 1927). Conative attitudes share the core properties of doxastic\nand affective attitudes: once a subject is confronted with certain\nfacts in cognitions or presentations, it is possible for her to\nrespond to those facts by adopting a conative position. To go back to\nthe previous example, the acquaintance with the disvalue of the child\nfalling on the street can also motivate you to adopt a particular\nconative stance, e.g., by forming the will to help the child.\n\nThe will always represents the goal under a positive value-property:\nthe conative attitude is fit if the goal (the state of affairs to be\nbrought about by the action) indeed exemplifies the represented\nvalue-property and if alternative goals exemplify properties that are\nof lower rank (that is why elements like premeditation, preferences\nand, more generally, the experiences by which we grasp the\ngoal\u2019s value-property have moral relevance, see Reinach 1912/13;\nvon Hildebrand 1916). Phenomenologists put the category of the will\n(rather than that of desire) at the heart of intentional agency. In\ncontrast to a widespread tendency of tracing the will back to wishes\nor desires (see Frankfurt 1971), phenomenologists argue that willing\nis a sui generis experience (Scheler 1913/16: 143f,\nL\u00f6wenstein 1933). One of the main differences between willing and\ndesiring is that the former, but not the latter, entails the\ndisposition of forming a decision or intention (Entschluss or\nVorsatz): just as the belief that p (but, say, not the\nassumption that p) entails the disposition of asserting p, so\nwanting that p (but not desiring that p) grounds the\ndisposition of intending that p (von Hildebrand 1916: 36, Salice\nforthcoming A).\n\nIntentions (like assertions) are not attitudes, but mental actions\n(whereby intentions as actions [das Fassen eines Vorsatzes]\nshould be distinguished from the states of having an intention\n[das Haben eines Vorsatzes], Reinach 1913b [1989: 158f],\nSalice 2018). Intentions aim at realizing projects that are\ninstrumental to reach the goal (which is spelled out by the willing).\nFor instance, if you intend or decide to help the child on the street,\nyou will form a plan or project on how to do that (calling an\nambulance, providing first aid, etc.). Intentions are acts of\nself-determination (or \u201ccausally self-referential\nattitudes\u201d to use Searle\u2019s terminology, 1983: 86ff): the\nintention is satisfied if it is the subject of the intention that\nbrings about the project (Pf\u00e4nder 1911a: 174; Heller 1932: 254f).\nIntentions also self-commit the subject: when the subject forms an\nintention, they thereby put themselves under a commitment to satisfy\nit (von Hildebrand 1916: 159; see also Reiner 1927: 71). Intentions\nhave the power of triggering actions (some phenomenologists claim that\nthis triggering identifies a further act lying in between the\nintention and the bodily movements, see von Hildebrand 1916: 161f, but\nthe existence of this act is contested, see Reiner 1927: 76ff).\nFinally, intentions control actions via \u201cacts of\nrealization\u201d (Realisierungsakte) that accompany and\naffect bodily movements (Scheler 1913/16: 142; von Hildebrand 1916:\n152).\n2.2 Social, Empathic, and Collective Experiences\n\nEarly phenomenologists did not shed light only on infra-personal\nintentionality (intentional experiences that, roughly, do not require\nthe existence of other persons). They also devoted extensive\ninvestigations to cases of intersubjective intentionality (intentional\nexperiences that require the existence of other persons). These\ninvestigations can be summarized under three main umbrella topics:\nsocial or speech acts, acts of empathy, collective acts.\n\nSocial Acts. An act is social if it stands under the\nrequirement of being understood by its addressee in order to be\nsuccessfully or happily performed. On this definition, acts like\npromises, orders, bets, apologies, and more in general: all so-called\n\u201cspeech\u201d acts, are social acts. (It is worth noting that\nthe concept of \u201csocial act\u201d as \u201csocial operation of\nthe mind\u201d can be found in Thomas Reid already, see Schuhmann\n& Smith 1990. Reid was not unknown within the two circles of\nphenomenology, see Peters 1909, but there is no solid evidence that\nearly phenomenologists adopted this idea from Reid, see Mulligan\n1987a: 33f n 5.) One main difference between the phenomenological and\nthe ordinary language approach to speech acts is that the tradition\ninaugurated by John Austin understands speech acts as conventional or\nritual actions (Austin 1962: 14), whereas phenomenology describes them\nas mental acts or experiences (Smith 1990).\n\nThe first steps towards a theory of social acts are made by\nPf\u00e4nder and Daubert. In his logic of imperatives (1909),\nPf\u00e4nder theorizes that the logical form of imperatives is\ndifferent from that of predicative sentences. This provides evidence\nfor the idea that the act of ordering something is not identical to\nthe judgment of having a certain conative experience. Daubert\ndeveloped extensive considerations about questions around 1911/12\n(Schuhmann & Smith 1987; despite his influential role within early\nphenomenology, Daubert never published a single line in his life and\nthe only sources available to scholars are unpublished manuscripts).\nIn these considerations, he describes various phenomena that are\nusually collated under the label of \u201cquestion\u201d, and argues\nthat, among various erotetic phenomena, one in particular should be\nset apart. While many erotetic phenomena are purely inner phenomena,\nwhen one raises a \u201cdirect question\u201d, then one addresses\nthe question to somebody else.\n\nIt is plausible to assume that Reinach\u2014who in 1913 presented the\nmost advanced and articulated theory of such acts within\nphenomenology\u2014developed his position in close dialogue with both\nPf\u00e4nder and Daubert (Reinach 1913b; see also Schuhmann 2004b;\nSmith 1990). In fact, Reinach expands on the ideas that social acts\nare not descriptions of inner experiences and that these acts have\naddressees. More specifically, Reinach defines social acts as all\nthose acts that are in-need-of-being-heard\n(vernehmungsbed\u00fcrftig, see Mulligan 1987a). A social act\nperformed between two or more human beings is heard (in this specific\nsense), according to Reinach, when three conditions are satisfied:\nfirst, the linguistic utterance is acoustically or visually perceived\nby the act\u2019s addressee; second, the addressee understands the\ncontent of the utterance; third, the addressee understands the type of\nthe act, that is, she understands whether a given utterance is a\npromise, an order, etc. Furthermore, social acts have illocutionary\neffects: a promise, e.g., generates a claim on the promisee\u2019s\nend and an obligation on the promisor\u2019s end. Finally, social\nacts undergo various modifications: they can be honest or treacherous,\nthey can be addressed to many and/or performed by many, they (or their\ncontents) can be conditional, they can be performed in the name of\nsomebody else.\n\nReinach\u2019s ideas have proven to be seminal for further\ninvestigations. For instance, von Hildebrand extends the idea of\nexperiences that are in need of being heard to emotions: accordingly,\nsome forms of love are claimed to exemplify that property as love can\nbe reciprocated only if the loved one is aware of being loved (von\nHildebrand 1930: 28f). Schapp applies Reinach\u2019s idea of promises\nas generators of claims and commitments to develop a theory of\neconomic contracts (1930). Also, Stein advances Reinach\u2019s theory\nby discussing the possibility for states to be subject of social acts\nand, especially, of enactments (1925, see Taieb forthcoming).\n\nEmpathy. We have seen that part of what it means for a social\nact to be happy is that the addressee grasps the act that is addressed\nto her. This presupposes the ability of understanding others and their\nmental states, which invites the question of how, in general, that is\npossible. An initial answer to this question is provided by Lipps, who\nadopts the notion of empathy (Einf\u00fchlung) from debates\nin aesthetics and claims that empathy is the specific experience,\nwhich enables social understanding. Empathy, according to Lipps,\nrelies on two innate drives: a drive to imitate others and a drive to\nexpress mental states. On Lipps\u2019 view, I understand that the\nother is sad, when the following happens: First, I should be aware\nthat, whenever I am sad, an inner drive leads me to express sadness.\nSecond, when I see the other\u2019s face, this triggers the drive of\nimitating his expression in me. Because in my mental life, that facial\nexpression has constantly been linked with sadness, having that\nexpression induces sadness in me. By feeling sad with the other, I\nproject sadness onto him (Lipps 1907a).\n\nThis understanding of empathy rapidly attracted criticisms in the\nMunich and G\u00f6ttingen circles. One of the most striking criticisms\nwas that Lipps\u2019 account is not able to explain the\nexplanandum: why the fact that the other\u2019s expression\ninduces a certain mental state in me (which I then project onto the\nother) is supposed to explain my understanding of the other\u2019s\nmental state? And can\u2019t I understand the other without living\nthrough his mental state? (see Zahavi 2014: 131f). As an alternative\nsolution, phenomenologists argue that mental states are not\nunobservable entities that lie \u201cbehind\u201d our bodily\nexpressions and gestures. Rather, mental states can be genuinely\nperceived: they are perceived in these very movements and gestures\n(see Scheler 1923).\n\nPerhaps one of the first explicit formulation of this idea is provided\nby Schwenninger in 1908. In his critical discussion of Hume\u2019s\nnotion of sympathy (which is also directed against Lipps),\nSchwenninger writes:\n\n\nthe consciousness of the mental state [Seelenzustand] is\nimmediately included in the perception of the gesture\n[Geb\u00e4rde]. I grasp something [and] this is what is\nexpressed in the expression; this means: in the grasp, an intimate\nconnection, unity, intertwinement [Ineinander] between\nexpression and expressed obtains. [\u2026] (1908: 44)\n\n\nImportantly, Schwenninger argues further:\n\n\nspeaking of perception here [that is, of perception as applied to\nmental states] is just as correct as speaking of perception in the\ncase of three-dimensional objects. [\u2026] The sympathizer [der\nSympathisierende] perceives that the other expresses certain\nmental experiences and, therefore, also perceives these experiences,\nbut he does not live through them himself, which just means that he\ndoes not have an adequate inner perception [of these experiences].\n(1908: 46f)\n\n\nThe ideas that mental states can be perceived in the gestures of\nothers and that the perceiver does not live through the other\u2019s\nexperience are the building blocks of early phenomenology\u2019s\ntheory of social cognition. In particular, Stein (1917) puts them at\nthe basis of her articulated view of empathy, according to which the\nperception of the other\u2019s mental state is only the first step in\nthe cognitive process that leads to a fuller understanding of the\nother. After one is struck, as it were, by the other\u2019s mental\nstate in perception, one has the possibility to put oneself in the\nother\u2019s shoes and, thereby, to explicate the experience (e.g.,\nby appreciating the intentional object of the state). In a third step,\nthe empathizer can gain a piece of propositional knowledge by forming\nthe thought that subject x lives through a given experience (see\nalso Dullstein 2013).\n\nCollective Acts. Paradigmatic cases of empathy or of social\nacts exemplify an I-Thou intentional relation where an I is\ndirected towards the other as a you. This relation should be\ndistinguished from the collective relation in which you and I share an\nexperience as ours. Interestingly, the phenomenological\ninvestigation into experiential sharing is part and parcel of a larger\ninvestigation into various forms of groups. The two topics are related\nbecause phenomenologists argue that different kinds of groups\ncorrelate with different kinds of social attitudes.\n\nThe starting point of this investigation is the distinction between\nsocieties, communities, and masses (Scheler 1913/16; Stavenhagen 1934;\nStein 1922; von Hildebrand 1930; Walther 1923). The distinction\nbetween societies and communities has been drawn originally by\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies (in his seminal book of 1887) and the\nintroduction of the mass as a different kind of group in the taxonomy\nshould be mainly credited to Scheler, who adopts it from French\nsociology (see Stavenhagen 1936: 20; Thonhauser forthcoming).\n\nWhat animates crowds is mental contagion, which is the psychological\nmechanism whereby the mental states of one individual pass (often\nunconsciously) to another individual. In crowds, individuals form\nmental states on the basis of others\u2019 mental states, but the\ninduced states are entertained without a reason. So, for instance, the\nwarranted joy of a subject x may infect individual y\nwho elicits an emotional episode of the same kind, but without having\na reason for it. This is what makes crowds different from societies:\nin societies, too, individuals form mental states on the basis of\nothers\u2019 mental states, but here the individuals take the\nother\u2019s mental state to be a reason for them to entertain their\nown states. For instance, agent x might form the intention to\nact with agent y (and vice versa) because x\nand y come to know that each of them pursues the same\ngoal.\n\nCrowds and societies should be distinguished from communities. Whereas\ncrowds are characterized by mental contagion and societies by\ninterlocked experiences (often based on instrumental considerations),\nmembers of communities share experiences. For instance, when two\nparents stand beside the dead body of their child, they mourn together\nand, thereby, share their experience of mourning (Scheler 1923: 23f).\nOne of the elements that sets experiential sharing apart from the\nprevious two forms of sociality is the sense of us that infuses the\nlife of the community members and that grounds solidary behavior among\nthem. Communal or collective experiences are lived through as\nours by the group members and that is why these members are\nprone to mutual help and support.\n\nThe pre-conditions of collective experiences are debated in early\nphenomenology. According to Walther, what makes an experience ours is\na complex structure of social cognition: the individuals, under\ncondition of common knowledge, empathize with each other and mutually\nunify, where \u201cunification\u201d is described as a particular\naffective state (see Le\u00f3n & Zahavi 2016; Zahavi &\nSalice 2016). Other authors, e.g., Stein, emphasize a rationality\nrequirement: among other conditions, for an experience to qualify as\ncollective, it has to be entertained for a group\u2019s reason.\nAccordingly, a single individual could live through a collective\nexperience as long as that experience is sustained by a group reason\n(Stein 1922: 123; Szanto 2015). Other authors, e.g., Stavenhagen, put\na self-understanding as a group member at the core of collective\nexperiences: for an experience to qualify as such, the subject must\nunderstand herself as belonging to a group. Interestingly, Stavenhagen\nidentifies several factors that could lead to that self-understanding\n(Salice forthcoming B): sharing preferences with others, having mutual\nrespect, or being part of an \u201cemotional tradition\u201d are\nelements that can elicit that particular self-understanding.\n3. The Theory of Objects in the Munich and G\u00f6ttingen Circles\n\nThe previous section introduced phenomenological descriptions of\nvarious kinds of experiences. These descriptions are presented by\nphenomenologists as \u201ceidetic\u201d, which means that they are\nsupposed to identify the essential properties of the experiences at\nissue. Phenomenology, however, is not merely concerned with providing\neidetic descriptions of mental experiences. That is why the\n\u201cphenomenology of acts\u201d (Aktph\u00e4nomenologie)\nshould be distinguished from (although it is not unrelated to) the\n\u201cphenomenology of objects\u201d\n(Gegenstandsph\u00e4nomenologie, Geiger 1907: 355). Among\nother tasks, the latter discipline (also called \u201ctheory of\nobjects\u201d or \u201contology\u201d) is concerned with the\nidentification of the essential properties exemplified by objects of\nall kinds (and not only by objects of the mental kind).\n3.1 General Features\n\nThere are at least three interrelated features that broadly\ncharacterize the wide range of early phenomenological investigations\non ontology: metaphysical realism, ontological pluralism, and\nessentialism.\n\nMetaphysical realism. Early phenomenologists consider the\nworld to be made, in large part, of a variety of objects that are\nintentionality-independent. Accordingly, these objects exist\nindependently of a subject that might know them (regardless of how the\nnotion of the subject is conceived of). It is important to remark that\nthis position does not exclude the existence of objects, which are\nintentionality-dependent: artefacts and social objects like\ninstitutional facts (promissory commitments, institutions, etc.) exist\nprecisely because there are individuals or communities that\nintentionally create them. Interestingly, it is assumed that,\nregardless of its relation to intentionality, the existence of an\nobject always implies the possibility for this object to be known by a\ncognizer, which is why (at least in principle) all objects and their\nproperties are intelligible.\n\nOntological Pluralism. Objects belong to different\nfundamental categories. Because there are fundamentally different\nkinds of objects, their investigations are also assigned to different\ndisciplines. This is why psychologism has to be discarded: logical\npsychologism, e.g., collapses different categories (the psychological\nand the logical) into one, leading to the conclusion that there is one\nsingle discipline\u2014psychology\u2014in charge of their\ninvestigation. The flip side of ontological pluralism is\nanti-reductionism and a descriptive approach to ontological questions:\nall objects must be described as they are\u2014without failing to the\ntemptation of reducing one kind of objects to another (Geiger 1933).\nAgainst this backdrop, eidetic descriptions are occasionally\ncontrasted to definitions that characterize a concept in terms of\nother concepts: the idea is that definitions of this sort should be\navoided because they \u201cbetray\u201d the very essence of the\ndefiniendum (cf. Reinach 1914 [1989: 535], on the relations\nbetween explanation and description, see also Brunswig 1904\u00a0and\nMulligan 2012: \u00a71). This view has been criticized, even within\nphenomenology, for being conducive to a form of phenomenology\ncharacterized as \u201cpicture book phenomenology\u201d\n(Bilderbuchph\u00e4nomenologie, Scheler 1913/16: 11;\nH\u00e9ring 1939: 370 n 1).\n\nEssentialism. Phenomenological ontology is committed to a\nform of essentialism according to which objects are constituted by an\nessence. It should be noted that the word \u201cessence\u201d\n(Wesen) is ambiguous (Reinach 1912): on the one hand, it can\nrefer to the so-being of an individual object, i.e., to that which\nmakes an individual the individual it is. For instance, how finely a\ngiven quill pen writes is a property that qualifies this individual\npen as the pen it is\u2014for no other pen can write in the same fine\nway (H\u00e9ring 1921: 496f; H\u00e9ring reserves the term,\n\u201cessence\u201d (Wesen), for this concept; see also De\nSantis 2015, Fabbianelli 2016). On the other, it can also indicate the\nwhat-being of a given object or the kind to which it belongs: e.g.,\nbeing a pen is one such kind (H\u00e9ring uses the word\n\u201cessentiality\u201d (Wesenheit) to refer to essence in\nthis second sense, see 1921: 505ff and Seifert 1996). Essences (in\nthis second sense) ground necessity (H\u00e9ring 1921; Ingarden\n1925; Reinach 1911b). For instance, the essence of promise, color,\nmovement, or tone grounds the necessary facts that promises generate\nclaims and obligations, that colors have extension, that movements\nhave velocity, that tones have pitch and intensity, etc. (see also\nMulligan 2004; Fine 1994a,b, 1995). Essences are taken to exist\nindependently of whether they have exemplifications or not. As such,\nthey are described as ideal (abstract) and atemporal objects. Not all\nessences are atemporal, though: for instance, Geiger discusses the\nidea of \u201cdynamic essences\u201d (Geiger 1924, e.g., the essence\nof the tragic), which evolve through time and are characteristically\ninstantiated in artworks.\n3.2 Objects and States of Affairs\n\nAlmost all phenomenological investigations into ontology presuppose\nthat \u201cobjectualities\u201d (Gegenst\u00e4ndlichkeiten)\ncome in two kinds: objects and states of affairs.\n\nObjects are the objectual correlates of nominal acts: if you perceive\n(think of, remember, imagine, etc.) Napoleon, then Napoleon is the\nobject of your perception. From a linguistic point of view, objects\nare the referents of singular terms, be they concrete or abstract. In\nline with Husserl\u2019s LI, early phenomenology takes the category\nof object to be divided into the two sub-categories of real and ideal\nobjects, which are distinguished by their relation to time (cf. Hua\nXIX 129f). Ideal objects are atemporal; these are usually taken to be\neither general or individual objects. Properties and essences are\ngeneral because they can be predicated of several objects. By\ncontrast, ideal objects, which cannot be predicated of anything else,\nare individual. So, e.g., Reinach takes natural numbers to be ideal\nand individual for they are not predicated of other entities\n(1911c [1989: 58]; 1914 [1989: 539f]). Real objects are temporal, and\nthis category is traditionally divided into material and mental\nobjects. Over the years, this standard classification underwent\nsubstantial revision: in particular, the increasing attention devoted\nto social ontology led phenomenology to enrich its table of categories\n(Salice 2013). For instance, the case of entities like promissory\nclaims and obligations called into question the strong connection\nhitherto endorsed or presupposed between ideality and temporality: on\nthe one hand, these entities are neither material nor mental; on the\nother, they are temporal (they are brought about by a successful\npromise and extinguish when the promise is honored). Also, we have\nalready seen that investigations into aesthetics led some\nphenomenologists to accept the existence of essences that are ideal,\nbut nonetheless temporal or historical (for a similar conception, see\nalso Husserl\u2019s notion of \u201cbound idealities\u201d, 1938:\n321).\n\nStates of affairs are the objectual correlates of propositional\nattitudes like assumptions and judgments. Judging always is judging\nthat something is or is not the case. That which is or is not\nthe case is the state of affairs the mental attitude is directed\ntowards. States of affairs are the referents of declarative sentences\nas well as of perfect nominals (perfect nominals are linguistic\nconstructions that contain a gerund and can syntactically act as\nnames, e.g., \u201cthe rose\u2019s being red\u201d, cf. Vendler\n1967). The German expression for state of affairs is\nSachverhalt, which apparently was introduced in the Brentano\nSchool around 1888 by Carl Stumpf (Rojszczak & Smith 2003: 165;\nMeinong\u2019s equivalent reads \u201cobjective\n[Objektiv]\u201d, Salice 2009). The term has its roots in\njurisprudence (Smith 1978a) where it is used to express the\n\u201cjuridical \u2018status\u2019 in the sense of \u2018status\nrerum\u2019 (state or constitution of things)\u201d (Smith 1988:\n25). This is conducive to how early phenomenologists use the term\nSachverhalt: objects or things have an ontological structure,\nand this is a structure of states of affairs. (When this structure\ninvolves a value-property, then phenomenologists sometimes talk of a\n\u201cstate of value\u201d [Wertverhalt]).\n\nEarly phenomenological debate about these entities extends over many\nyears and is animated by various positions. These different positions\ncan be sorted into two more or less well-defined competing views.\nAccording to the first, all states of affairs have an ontological\nstatus of their own, which is intentionality-independent. The second\nview claims that only a restricted class of states of affairs are\nintentionality-independent entities. On this second view,\nnon-obtaining states of affairs (e.g., Elvis\u2019 being the\npresident of the US) or negative states of affairs (e.g., the not\nbeing red of the White House) or existential states of affairs (the\nexistence of Barack Obama) or impersonal states of affairs (the state\nof affairs that it is raining) and/or other kinds of state of affairs\nhave been argued to be intentionality-dependent.\n\nIn this debate, Reinach\u2019s theory represents one extreme position\n(Reinach 1911a): according to him, all meaningful declarative\nsentences are directed towards states of affairs. True sentences\n(i.e., those sentences which express true propositions) refer to\nobtaining states of affairs, false ones to non-obtaining. States of\naffairs make propositions true or false: they are truth-makers and the\ncorresponding propositions truth-bearers. Reinach does not elaborate\non the truth-making relation, but an interesting account of this\nrelation in terms of the principle of sufficient reason is developed\nby Pf\u00e4nder in his Logic of 1921 (see also Mulligan\n2008b).\n\nIn addition, Reinach suggests that states of affairs are either\npositive or negative, and he argues that either a positive state of\naffairs or its negative contradictory obtains (e.g., either the\nbeing-red of the rose obtains or its not-being red). The principle of\nthe excluded middle is hence claimed to hold for states of affairs\nand, analogously, other principles traditionally believed to be of a\nlogical nature (and in particular the laws of inference, see 1911a\n[1989: 115]) are interpreted by Reinach as being primarily ontological\nprinciples, i.e., principles which hold for states of affairs. That\nis, states of affairs are the objects of logic (1911a [1989: 138 n\n1]), and logic is primarily about states of affairs and only\nsecondarily about truth-bearers (on this point, see also Gallinger\n1912, Honecker 1921, Gardies 1985).\n\nAn ontologically more parsimonious counterpart to this first position\nwas developed by Daubert. In his theory of judgment, Daubert draws a\ndistinction between two notions. First, he calls \u201cstates of\naffairs\u201d complex entities which exist independently of\nintentionality, e.g., the being-red of the rose (cf. Schuhmann &\nSmith 1987; Schuhmann 2004c). In addition to states of affairs, he\nalso identifies so-called \u201cstates of affairs as cognized\u201d\n(Kenntnisverhalte), which are described as\nintentionality-dependent entities. (Although using different\nterminology, Pf\u00e4nder, too, seems to have had a similar\ndistinction in mind in 1921 when he speaks of \u201cthe objects in\ntheir objectual state\u201d (das Selbstverhalten der\nGegenst\u00e4nde) and of \u201cstates of affairs\u201d as\nentities which are \u201cprojected or outlined\u201d\n(entworfen) by judgment and which are \u201ccompletely\ndependent\u201d on judgment, Pf\u00e4nder 1921: 40f, 253.)\n\nDaubert\u2019s idea is that, within a judgment, an aspect of the\nstate of affairs is selected by the mind and conceptually framed. So,\nfor instance, the expressions\n\n\u201cthe chairman opens the meeting\u201d,\n\u201cthe chairman is opening the meeting\u201d,\n\u201cthe meeting is being opened by the chairman\u201d,\n\u201cthe opening of the meeting is being conducted by the\nchairman\u201d and\n\u201cthe chairman has opened the meeting\u201d, (cf. Schuhmann\n& Smith 1987: 368)\n\n\npoint at different \u201cstates of affairs as cognized\u201d\n(Kenntnisverhalte) to which the same state of affairs\npertains. The same can be said for expressions such as \u201ca >\nb\u201d and \u201cb < a\u201d. In the\nLI, Husserl employs this very same example to argue that the two\nsentences express different propositional meanings pointing at the\nsame state of affairs (Hua XIX A 48). Daubert reports having discussed\nthis example with Husserl (Schuhmann 2004c: 206 n 25), which might\nhave inspired Husserl to replace his previous theory of the LI with\nhis later distinction, which is analogous to Daubert\u2019s own,\nbetween states of affairs and situations (Sachlagen, see Hua\nXXVI 97f, Husserl 1938: 285ff).\n\nTo be sure, Reinach, too, distinguishes between coarse-grained\n\u201cfactual material\u201d (Tatbestand) and fine-grained\nstates of affairs (Smith 1987: 218ff). Yet, contrary to Reinach,\nDaubert contends that states of affairs as cognized do not exist\nwithout corresponding judgments. Moreover, Daubert claims that,\nanalogously to states of affairs as cognized, states of affairs as\nquestioned (Frageverhalte) or as ordered\n(Befehlsverhalte) also exist only in relation to acts of\nquestion or of order (Schuhmann 2004b: 91).\n\nDaubert\u2019s position raises the question as to what properties\nqualify states of affairs proper and what properties qualify states of\naffairs as cognized. For instance, Daubert holds that there are no\nnegative states of affairs, but only negative\nKenntnisverhalte (cf. Schuhmann 1987\u2014based on a\nsomewhat similar approach, Ingarden, too, denies the existence of\nintentionality-independent negative states of affairs, see 1964 II/1;\nChrudzimski 2010). Analogously, Pf\u00e4nder (1921: 72f) argues that,\nwhen it comes to giving an account of impersonal judgments, these have\nimpersonal states of affairs as their correlates, but the\nincompleteness that characterizes such states of affairs has no place\nat the level of reality, i.e., at the level of \u201cthe objects in\ntheir objectual state\u201d (a position which, again, is in agreement\nwith Daubert, Schuhmann 1998: 184).\n4. Conclusion\n\nEarly phenomenologists make up a philosophical tradition that has been\nalmost wholly overlooked by historians of twentieth century\nphilosophy. Partly building upon the ideas of Husserl and other\nphilosophers, while nevertheless also developing their own ideas\nindependently, they made contributions to as many fields as the\nphilosophy of mind, the philosophy of psychology, the philosophy of\nspeech acts, epistemology, social philosophy, axiology, and\nontology.\n\nSome of their most important contributions are accounts of the\ndistinction between presentations (perceptions and imaginations) and\nthe acts of meaning something with an expression; of affective\nphenomena, including episodic emotions and long-lasting sentiments; of\nknowledge as a direct grasp of objects and states of affairs rather\nthan any sort of belief or conviction; of the distinction between\nattitudes or stances, such as belief and emotions, on the one hand,\nand knowledge, on the other; of the distinction between motivation and\nreasons, on the one hand, and mental causality, on the other; of the\nstructure of speech acts such as promises, orders and questions; of\ncollective intentionality and its relation to social facts; and of\nvalues, our acquaintance with them, and our reactions to them. In\nontology, they developed theories of states of affairs and an account\nof modality according to which the most fundamental type of necessity\nflows from the essences or natures of objects. The fact that their\nideas have been consistently overlooked is made even more curious by\nthe fact that they write in clear German and that many of their ideas\nwere rediscovered, beyond phenomenology, during the twentieth\ncentury.\n\nUncovering the full extent of these still rather neglected resources\nis an ongoing process that promises to impact different strands of\nphilosophical debate and to substantially enrich the received picture\nof the phenomenological movement.\n",
