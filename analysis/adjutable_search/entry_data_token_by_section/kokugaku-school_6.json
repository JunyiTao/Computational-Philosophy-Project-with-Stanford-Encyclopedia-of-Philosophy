One of the major\ncenters of Hirata disciples was in Shim\u014dsa province of\ntoday\u2019s northern Chiba and Ibaraki prefectures, whose\nregistrants numbered over 200 by the time of the Meiji Restoration.\nMembers of the Hirata family visited Shim\u014dsa\u2014Atsutane gave\nlectures, while adopted son and administrator of the academy, Hirata\nKanetane (1799\u20131880), raised funds for publishing.\n\nThe result was the recruitment of many disciples, including Miyahiro\nSadao (1797\u20131858) who himself registered with the academy in\n1826. Sadao had overcome excessive drinking and corruption and\ntransformed himself into a hardworking and respected village headman\n(nanushi) of Matsuzawa village. A self-proclaimed\n\u201cpotato-digging headman\u201d, Sadao reclaimed agricultural\nland, repaired roads, and grew medicinal herbs. Later that same year\nof 1826, the Hirata family began to publish several agricultural\nmanuals beginning with Sadao\u2019s Essentials on\nAgriculture or N\u014dgy\u014d y\u014dsh\u016b, which\noffers instruction to farmers on the practice and profitability of\nplanting. The Hirata academy facilitated the publishing of hundreds of\ncopies of such farming manuals to meet a growing demand in\nagricultural communities, while Sadao and other disciples contributed\ncapital. Records of Plant Seed Selection or S\u014dmoku\ntane erami, also authored by Sadao, explains plant gender and\nargues that planting female seeds would lead to a large harvest.\n\nIn 1832, Sadao completed Thesis on National Profit or\nKokueki honron. For the sake of the national economy, Sadao\nuses Atsutane\u2019s teachings as a call to revere and worship\nthe kishin spirits, who have the will and power to create\nprosperity but, when angered, will become wrathful and bring about\nmisfortune (KH: 292). He writes:\n\n\nFirst, a country\u2019s decline is the result of people\u2019s being\nunjust in mind and carrying out crooked behavior, as well as staining\ntheir minds, staining their bodies, and staining their households. It\nis a result of them turning their backs on the hearts of\nkishin spirits of heaven and earth and, thereby, escaping\ntheir grace. Moreover, in years of bad harvest and famine, or\nencountering calamities such as fires and epidemic, people dwindle and\ntheir fortunes shrink. A country\u2019s decline all results from such\nrebuke from the kishin spirits. (KH: 292)\n\n\nAtsutane is credited for popularizing Kokugaku among agriculturalists\nacross rural Japan by linking their mundane farm work with the Ancient\nWay, valuing their labor as service to the gods. In Matsuzawa, Sadao\nwas one Hirata follower whose writings and leadership equated\nagriculturalist labor of the peasant masses with sacred service to the\ngods.\n\nAccording to Sadao, another key to achieving the goal of national\nprosperity was to educate peasants. He laments the state and\navailability of agricultural education:\n\n\nFurthermore, knowledge or ignorance in agriculture, or the skill or\nlack of skill greatly affects a country\u2019s profit and loss.\nTherefore, I say, \u201cagriculture is the foundation of the\ncountry\u201d, because it is an industry which cannot be neglected.\nYet, the general tendency is that there are few skilled\nagriculturalists and many unskilled farmers. This is precisely because\nthere are no expert agricultural teachers. If those lords\n(ry\u014dshu) issued orders, and selected agriculturalists\nknowledgeable about horticulture and appointed them as agricultural\nteachers who educated those unskilled farmers, this would surely\ncontribute to that national profit. (KH: 292)\n\n\nAs an experienced farmer himself, Sadao asserts the need for proper\ntraining, and the farming manuals he wrote and helped to publish were\nmeant to contribute to this purpose.\n\nThe influence of Hirata Atsutane\u2019s theories on the invisible\nkakuriyo realm of spirits as articulated in the August\nPillar of the Spirit (Tama no mihashira) and New\nTreatise on Spirits (Kishin shinron) surfaces in\nSadao\u2019s writings. Sadao reaffirms the theories asserted by\nAtsutane that divine spirits which dwell and act in the\nkakuriyo realm also intervene in the lives of the people\nliving in this visible world (arahaniyo). Sadao observes that\nthe kami look upon human beings and see their good and bad, unjust and\njust, and even perceive the thoughts within their minds. He points to\nthe ancient accounts of the divine age which state that good things\nare born out of pure and bright matter, while bad things result from\nfilth. When the state is stained and the people are also stained, the\nkishin spirits are angered, and calamities result in the\nworld.\n\nSadao asserts his thesis, \n\n\nThus, when the actions of these people are rectified and are pleasing\nto the hearts of the gods so they avoid calamities, all things see no\ndecline, and the people and fortunes are abundant throughout the\ncountry. This, therefore, is the national profit. (KH: 307) \n\n\nHe advocates appointing people attuned to the Way and virtue as\nteachers to instruct local lords (my\u014dshu) and terakoya\nschool teachers on proper education, so they can then instruct the\npeople\u2014men and women, young and old. Thus, he hoped that many\nwould return to the \u201csimplicity\u201d of the ancient peoples as\ndescribed by Atsutane, live by the Way, and respond to the heavenly\nand earthly kishin spirits. This would then result in\nstability of the state, no calamity, population growth, increase in\nriches, development of lands, and robust security. This would result\nin Japan being a prosperous imperial country. Sadao asserts that\nImperial Japan would be invincible in the world and subjugate\nbarbarian nations, as it added to its own riches.\n",
