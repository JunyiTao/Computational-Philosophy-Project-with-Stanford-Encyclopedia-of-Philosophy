    "main_text": "Contraction || Partial meet contraction\n2.1 Partial meet contraction\n\nThe outcome of contracting \\(K\\) by \\(p\\) should be a subset of \\(K\\)\nthat does not imply \\(p\\), but from which no elements of \\(K\\) have\nbeen unnecessarily removed. Therefore, it is of interest to consider\nthe inclusion-maximal subsets of \\(K\\) that do not imply \\(p\\).\n\nFor any set \\(A\\) and sentence \\(p\\) the remainder set\n\\(A\\bot p\\) (\u201c\\(A\\) remainder \\(p\\)\u201d) is the set of\ninclusion-maximal subsets of \\(A\\) that do not imply \\(p\\). In other\nwords, a set \\(B\\) is an element of \\(A\\bot p\\) if and only if it it\nis a subset of \\(A\\) that does not imply \\(p\\), and there is no set\n\\(B'\\) not implying \\(p\\) such that \\(B\\subset B'\\subseteq A\\). The\nelements of \\(A\\bot p\\) are called \u201cremainders\u201d.\n\nIf the operation of contraction uncompromisingly minimizes information\nloss, then \\(K\\div p\\) will be one of the remainders. However, this\nconstruction can be shown to have implausible properties. A more\nreasonable recipe for contraction is to let \\(K\\div p\\) be the\nintersection of some of the remainders. This is partial meet\ncontraction, the major innovation in the classic 1985 paper by\nCarlos Alchourr\u00f3n, Peter G\u00e4rdenfors and David Makinson. An\noperation of partial meet contraction employs a selection\nfunction that selects the \u201cbest\u201d elements of \\(K\\bot\np\\). More precisely, a selection function for \\(K\\) is a function\n\\(\\gamma\\) such that if \\(K\\bot p\\) is non-empty, then \\(\\gamma(K\\bot\np)\\) is a non-empty subset of \\(K\\bot p\\). In the limiting case when\n\\(K\\bot p\\) is empty, then \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p)\\) is defined to be equal\nto \\(\\{K\\}\\).\n\nThe outcome of the partial meet contraction is equal to the\nintersection of the set of selected elements of \\(K\\bot p\\), i.e.\n\\(K\\div p = \\bigcap \\gamma(K\\bot p)\\).\n\nThe limiting case when for all sentences \\(p\\), \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p)\\)\nhas exactly one element is called maxichoice contraction. The\nother limiting case in which \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p) = K\\bot p\\) whenever\n\\(K\\bot p\\) is non-empty is called full meet contraction.\nBoth limiting cases are technically useful, but they also both have\nhighly unrealistic properties.\n\nPartial meet contraction of a belief set satisfies six postulates that\nare called the basic G\u00e4rdenfors postulates (or basic AGM\npostulates). To begin with, when a belief set \\(K\\) is contracted by a\nsentence \\(p\\), the outcome should be logically closed.\n\nClosure:\n\n\\(K\\div p = \\Cn(K\\div p)\\) \n\nContraction should be successful, i.e., \\(K\\div p\\) should not imply\n\\(p\\) (or not contain \\(p\\), which is the same thing if Closure is\nsatisfied). However, it would be too much to require that \\(p \\not\\in\n\\Cn(K\\div p)\\) for all sentences \\(p\\), since it cannot hold if \\(p\\)\nis a tautology. The success postulate has to be conditional on \\(p\\)\nnot being logically true.\n\nSuccess:\n\nIf \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K\\div p)\\).\n\n\nThe Success postulate has been put in doubt since there may be\nsentences other than tautologies that an epistemic agent may refuse to\nwithdraw. (On operations that do not satisfy Success, see Section\n6.5.)\n\nThe contracted set is assumed to be a subset of the original one:\n\nInclusion:\n\n\\(K\\div p \\subseteq K\\) \n\nInclusion is usually considered to be a constitutive property of\ncontraction. However, it has also been questioned with the argument\nthat when the epistemic agent ceases to believe in \\(p\\), then this is\nusually because she receives some new information that contradicts\n\\(p\\). Arguably, that information should be included in \\(K\\div p\\).\n\n\nIf the sentence to be contracted is not included in the original\nbelief set, then contraction by that sentence involves no change at\nall. Such contractions are idle (vacuous) operations, and they should\nleave the original set unchanged.\n\nVacuity:\n\nIf \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K)\\), then \\(K\\div p = K\\). \n\nLogically equivalent sentences should be treated alike in\ncontraction:\n\nExtensionality:\n\nIf \\(p\\leftrightarrow q \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(K\\div p = K\\div\nq\\). \n\nExtensionality guarantees that the logic of contraction is extensional\nin the sense of allowing logically equivalent sentences to be freely\nsubstituted for each other.\n\nBelief contraction should not only be successful, it should also be\nminimal in the sense of leading to the loss of as few\nprevious beliefs as possible. The epistemic agent should give up\nbeliefs only when forced to do so, and should then give up as few of\nthem as possible. This is ensured by the following postulate:\n\nRecovery:\n\n\\(K \\subseteq (K\\div p)+p\\) \n\nAccording to Recovery, so much is retained after \\(p\\) has been\nremoved that everything will be recovered by reinclusion (through\nexpansion) of \\(p\\).\n\nOne of the central results about the AGM model is a representation\ntheorem for partial meet contraction. According to this theorem, an\noperation \\(\\div\\) is a partial meet contraction for a belief set\n\\(K\\) if and only if it satisfies the six above-mentioned postulates,\nnamely Closure, Success, Inclusion, Vacuity, Extensionality, and\nRecovery.\n\nA selection function for a belief set \\(K\\) should, for all sentences\n\\(p\\), select those elements of \\(K\\bot p\\) that are\n\u201cbest\u201d, or most worth retaining. However, the definition\nof a selection function is very general, and allows for quite\ndisorderly selection patterns. An orderly selection function should\nalways choose the best element(s) of the remainder set according to\nsome well-behaved preference relation. A selection function \\(\\gamma\\)\nfor a belief set \\(K\\) is relational if and only if there is\na binary relation \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) such that for all sentences \\(p\\), if\n\\(K\\bot p\\) is non-empty, then \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p) = \\{B \\in K\\bot p\n\\mid C\\mathbf{R}B\\) for all \\(C \\in K\\bot p\\}\\). Furthermore, if\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is transitive (i.e., it satisfies: If \\(A\\mathbf{R}B\\)\nand \\(B\\mathbf{R}C\\), then \\(A\\mathbf{R}C)\\), then \\(\\gamma\\) and the\npartial meet contraction that it gives rise to are transitively\nrelational.\n\nIn order to characterize transitively relational partial meet\ncontraction, postulates are needed that refer to contraction by\nconjunctions.\n\nIn order to give up a conjunction \\(p \\amp q\\), the agent must\nrelinquish either her belief in \\(p\\) or her belief in \\(q\\) (or\nboth). Suppose that contracting by \\(p \\amp q\\) leads to loss of the\nbelief in \\(p\\), i.e., that \\(p \\not\\in K\\div(p \\amp q)\\). It can be\nexpected that in this case contraction by \\(p \\amp q\\) should lead to\nthe loss of all beliefs that would have been lost in order to contract\nby \\(p\\). Another way to express this is that everything that is\nretained in \\(K\\div(p \\amp q)\\) is also retained in \\(K\\div p\\):\n\nConjunctive inclusion:\n\nIf \\(p \\not\\in K\\div(p \\amp q)\\), then \\(K\\div(p \\amp q) \\subseteq\nK\\div p\\). \n\nAnother fairly reasonable principle for contraction by conjunctions is\nthat whatever can withstand both contraction by \\(p\\) and contraction\nby \\(q\\) can also withstand contraction by \\(p \\amp q\\). In other\nwords, whatever is an element of both \\(K\\div p\\) and \\(K\\div q\\) is\nalso an element of \\(K\\div(p \\amp q)\\).\n\nConjunctive overlap:\n\n\\((K\\div p) \\cap (K\\div q) \\subseteq K\\div(p \\amp q)\\) \n\nConjunctive overlap and Conjunctive inclusion are commonly called\nG\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s supplementary postulates for belief\ncontraction. An operation \\(\\div\\) for \\(K\\) is a transitively\nrelational partial meet contraction if and only if it satisfies the\nsix basic postulates and in addition both Conjunctive overlap and\nConjunctive inclusion.\n",
