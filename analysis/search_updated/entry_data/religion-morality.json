    "preamble": "\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the Abrahamic faiths and of Greek philosophy,\nreligion and morality have been closely intertwined. This is true\nwhether we go back within Greek philosophy or within Christianity and\nJudaism and Islam. The present entry will not try to step beyond these\nconfines, since there are other entries on Eastern thought (see, for \nexample, the entries on\n Ethics in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism\nand\n Chinese Ethics).\n The entry\nproceeds chronologically, giving greatest length to the contemporary\nperiod.  It cannot, within the present compass, aspire to be\ncomprehensive.  But it will be able to describe the main\noptions as they have occurred historically.  The purpose of proceeding\nhistorically is to substantiate the claim that morality and religion\nhave been inseparable until very recently, and that our moral\nvocabulary is still deeply infused with this history. Since there are\nhistorically so many different ways to see the relation, a purely\nschematic or typological account is not likely to succeed as well.\nThe entry will not try to enter deeply into the ethical theories of\nthe individual philosophers mentioned, since this encyclopedia already\ncontains individual entries about them; it will focus on what they say\nabout the relation between morality and religion. \n\n\nThe term \u2018morality\u2019 as used in this entry will not be\ndistinguished from \u2018ethics.\u2019 Philosophers have drawn\nvarious contrasts between the two at various times (Kant for example,\nand Hegel, and more recently R.M. Hare and Bernard Williams). But\netymologically, the term \u2018moral\u2019 comes from the\nLatin mos, which means custom or habit, and it is a\ntranslation of the Greek ethos, which means roughly the same\nthing, and is the origin of the term \u2018ethics\u2019. In\ncontemporary non-technical use, the two terms are more or less\ninterchangeable, though \u2018ethics\u2019 has slightly more flavor\nof theory, and has been associated with the prescribed practice of\nvarious professions (e.g., medical ethics, etc.). In any case, this\nentry will assume that morality is a set of customs and habits that\nshape how we think about how we should live or about what is a good\nhuman life. The term \u2018religion\u2019 is much disputed. Again,\nwe can learn from the etymology. The origin of the word is probably\nthe Latin\nreligare, to bind back. Not all uses of the term require\nreference to a divinity or divinities. But this entry will use the\nterm so that there is such a reference, and a religion is a system of\nbelief and practice that accepting a \u2018binding\u2019 relation to\nsuch a being or beings. This does not, however, give us a single\nessence of religion, since the conceptions of divinity are so various,\nand human relations with divinity are conceived so variously that no\nsuch essence is apparent even within Western thought. The ancient\nGreeks, for example, had many intermediate categories between full\ngods or goddesses and human beings. There were spirits (in Greek\ndaimones) and spiritual beings like Socrates's mysterious\nvoice (daimonion) (Apology, 31d1\u20134, 40a2\u2013c3). There\nwere heroes who were offspring of one divine and one human\nparent. There were humans who were deified, like the kings of\nSparta. This is just within the culture of ancient Greece. If we\nincluded Eastern religions in the scope of the discussion, the hope\nfor finding a single essence of religion would recede\nfurther. Probably it is best to understand \u2018religion\u2019 as a term for a\ngroup of belief/practice amalgams with a family resemblance to each\nother, but no set of necessary and sufficient conditions tying them\ntogether (see Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations,\n65\u20137).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Ancient Greek Philosophy\n\nWe can start with the Greeks, and this means starting with Homer, a\nbody of texts transmitted first orally and then written down in the\nseventh century BCE. So what does the relation between morality and\nreligion look like in Homer? The first thing to say is that the gods\nand goddesses of the Homeric poems behave remarkably like the noble\nhumans described in the same poems, even though the humans are mortal\nand the gods and goddesses immortal. Both groups are motivated by the\ndesire for honor and glory, and are accordingly jealous when they\nreceive less than they think they should while others receive more,\nand work ceaselessly to rectify this. The two groups are not however\nsymmetrical, because the noble humans have the same kind of client\nrelation to the divinities as subordinate humans do to them. There is\na complex pattern that we might call \u2018an honor-loop\u2019 (see\nMikalson,\nHonor Thy Gods). The divinities have their functions (in\nGreek, the word is the same as \u2018honors\u2019), such as Poseidon's\noversight of the sea, and humans seek their favor with \u2018honor\u2019, which\nwe might here translate as \u2018worship\u2019. This includes, for example,\nsanctuaries devoted to them, dedications, hymns, dances, libations,\nrituals, prayers, festivals and sacrifices. In all of these the gods\ntake pleasure, and in return they give \u2018honor\u2019 to mortals in the form\nof help or assistance, especially in the areas of their own\nexpertise. There is a clear analogy with purely human\nclient-relations, which are validated in the Homeric narrative, since\nthe poems were probably originally sung at the courts of the princes\nwho claimed descent from the heroes whose exploits make up the\nstory. The gods and goddesses are not, however, completely at\nliberty. They too are accountable to fate or justice, as in the scene\nin the Iliad, where Zeus wants to save Hector, but he cannot\nbecause \u2018his doom has long been sealed\u2019 (Iliad, 22:\n179).\n\nIt is sometimes said that the Presocratic philosophers come\nout of Homer by rejecting religion in favor of science. There\nis a grain of truth in this, for when Thales (who flourished around\n580) is reported as saying \u2018Water is the origin (or principle) of all\nthings,\u2019 this is different from saying, for example, that Tethys is\nmother of all the rivers, because it deletes the character of\nnarrative or story (Aristotle's Metaphysics, 983b20\u20138). When\nAnaximenes (around 545) talks of air as the primary element differing\nin respect of thinness and thickness, or Heraclitus explains all\nchange as a pattern in the turnings of fire igniting in measures and\ngoing out in measures, they are not giving stories with plot-lines\ninvolving quasi-human intentions and frustrations (DK 13, A 5, DK 22,\nB 30). But it is wrong to say that they have left religion\nbehind. Heraclitus puts this enigmatically by saying that the one and\nonly wisdom does and does not consent to be called Zeus (DK 22, B\n14). He is affirming the divinity of this wisdom, but denying the\nanthropomorphic character of much Greek religion. \u2018To god all things\nare beautiful and good and just but humans suppose some things to be\njust and others unjust\u2019 (DK 22, B 102). He ties this divine wisdom to\nthe laws of a city, \u2018for all human laws are nourished by the one\ndivine law\u2019 (DK 22, B 114), though he does not have confidence that\n\u2018the many\u2019 are capable of making law. The sophists, to whom Socrates\nresponded, rejected this tie between human law and divine law and this\nwas in part because of their expertise in rhetoric, by which they\ntaught their students how to manipulate the deliberations of popular\nassemblies, and so change the laws to their own advantage. The most\nfamous case is Protagoras (c. 490\u201321), who stated in the first\nsentence of his book Truth that \u2018A human being is the measure\nof all things, of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is\nnot\u2019 (Plato's Theaetetus, 152a). Protagoras is not correctly\nseen here as skeptical about morality or religion. It is true that he\nclaimed he was not in a position to know either the manner in\nwhich the gods are or are not (another translation is \u2018that they are\nor are not\u2019) or what they are like in appearance (DK 80, B 4). But as\nPlato (c. 430\u2013347) presents him, he told the story that all humans\nhave been given by the gods the gifts of shame and justice, so as to\nmake possible the founding of cities; this is why each human\nis the measure. Even Thrasymachus, in the first book of Plato's\nRepublic, thinks of justice as the same thing amongst gods\nand humans (Republic, 388c). His view of what this justice\nis, namely the interest of the stronger, is disputed by Plato. But the\nclaim that justice operates at both the divine and human levels is\ncommon ground.\n\nSocrates (c. 470\u2013399) in one of the early dialogues debates the\nnature of the holy with Euthyphro, who is a religious\nprofessional. Euthyphro is taking his own father to court for murder,\nand though ordinary Greek morality would condemn such an action as\nimpiety, Euthyphro defends it on the basis that the gods behave in the\nsame sort of way, according to the traditional stories. Socrates makes\nit clear that he does not believe these stories, because they\nattribute immorality to the gods. This does not mean, however, that he\ndoes not believe in the gods. He was observant in his religious\npractices, and he objects to the charge of not believing in the city's\ngods that was one of the bases of the prosecution at his own trial. He\npoints to the spirit who gives him commands about what not to do\n(Apology, 31d), and we learn later that he found it\nsignificant that this voice never told him to stop conducting his\ntrial in the way that in fact led to his death (Ibid.,\n40a-c). Socrates interpreted this as an invitation from the gods to\ndie, thus refuting the charge that, by conducting his trial in the way\nhe did, he was guilty of theft \u2013 i.e., depriving the gods of his\nlife that properly belonged to them (Phaedo, 62b). His life\nin particular was a service to god, he thought, because his testing of\nthe wisdom of others was carrying out Apollo's charge given by the\noracle at Delphi, implicit in the startling pronouncement that he was\nthe wisest man in Greece (Apology, 21a-d).\n\n\nSocrates's problem with the traditional stories about the gods gives\nrise to what is sometimes called \u2018the Euthyphro\ndilemma\u2019. If we try to define the holy as what is loved by all\nthe gods (and goddesses), we will be faced with the question \u2018Is\nthe holy holy because it is loved by the gods, or do they love it\nbecause it is holy?\u2019 (Euthyphro, 10a). Socrates makes\nit clear that his view is the second (though he does not argue for\nthis conclusion in addressing this question, and he is probably\nrelying on the earlier premise, at\nEuthyphro, 7c10f, that we love things because of the\nproperties they have). (See Hare, Plato's Euthyphro, on this\npassage.) But his view is not an objection to tying morality and\nreligion together. He hints at the end of the dialogue\n(Euthyphro, 13de) that the right way to link them is to see\nthat when we do good we are serving the gods well. Plato probably does\nnot intend for us to construe the dialogues together as a single\nphilosophical system, and we must not erase the differences between\nthem. But it is significant that in the Theaetetus (176b),\nSocrates says again that our goal is to be as like the god as\npossible, and since the god is in no way and in no manner unjust, but\nas just as it is possible to be, nothing is more like the god than the\none among us who becomes correspondingly as just as possible. In\nseveral dialogues this thought is connected with a belief in the\nimmortality of the soul; we become like the god by paying attention to\nthe immortal and best part of ourselves (e.g., Symposium,\n210A-212B). The doctrine of the immortality of the soul is also tied\nto the doctrine of the Forms, whereby things with characteristics that\nwe experience in this life (e.g., beauty) are copies or imitations of\nthe Forms (e.g., The Beautiful-Itself) that we see without the\ndistraction of the body when our souls are separated at death. The\nForm of the Good, according to the Republic, is above all the\nother Forms and gives them their intelligibility (as, by analogy, the\nsun gives visibility), and is (in a pregnant phrase) \u2018on the other\nside of being\u2019 (Republic, 509b). Finally, in the\nLaws (716b), perhaps Plato's last work, the character called\n\u2018the Athenian\u2019 says that the god can serve for us in the highest\ndegree as a measure of all things, and much more than any human can,\nwhatever some people say; so people who are going to be friends with\nsuch a god must, as far as their powers allow, be like the gods\nthemselves.\n\nThis train of thought sees the god or gods as like a magnet, drawing\nus to be like them by the power of their goodness or excellence. In\nPlato's Ion (533d), the divine is compared to a magnet to\nwhich is attached a chain of rings, through which the attraction is\npassed. This conception is also pervasive in Aristotle (384\u201322),\nPlato's student for twenty years. In the Nicomachean Ethics,\nfor example, the words \u2018god\u2019 and \u2018divine\u2019\noccur roughly twice as often as the words \u2018happiness\u2019 and\n\u2018happy\u2019. This is significant, given that Aristotle's\nethical theory is (like Plato's) \u2018eudaimonist\u2019 (meaning\nthat our morality aims at our happiness). Mention of the divine is not\nmerely conventional for Aristotle, but does important philosophical\nwork. In the Eudemian Ethics (1249b5\u201322) he tells us\nthat the goal of our lives is service and contemplation of the god. He\nthinks that we become like what we contemplate, and so we become most\nlike the god by contemplating the god. Incidentally, this is why the\ngod does not contemplate us; for this would mean becoming less than\nthe god, which is impossible. As in Plato, the well-being of the city\ntakes precedence over the individual, and this, too, is justified\ntheologically. It is nobler and more divine to achieve an end for a\ncity than for an individual (NE 1094b9\u201310). Aristotle\ndraws a distinction between what we honor and what we merely commend\n(NE, 1101b10\u201335). There are six states for a human\nlife, on a normative scale from best to worst: divine (which exceeds\nthe merely human on the one extreme), virtuous (without wrongful\ndesire), strong-willed (able to overcome wrongful desire), weak-willed\n(unable to do so), vicious and bestial (which exceeds the merely human\non the other extreme, and which Aristotle says is mostly found among\nbarbarians) (NE, 1145a15\u201322). The highest form of\nhappiness, which he calls blessedness, is something we honor as we\nhonor gods, whereas virtue we merely commend. It would be as wrong to\ncommend blessedness as it would be to commend gods (NE,\n1096a10\u20131097a15). Sometimes Aristotle uses the phrase \u2018God\nor understanding\u2019 (in Greek, nous) (e.g.,\nPolitics, 1287a27\u201332). The activity of the god, he says in\nthe Metaphysics, is nous thinking itself\n(1074b34). The best human activity is the most god-like, namely\nthinking about the god and about things that do not\nchange. Aristotle's virtue ethics, then, needs to be understood\nagainst the background of these theological premises. He is thinking\nof the divine, to use Plato's metaphor, as magnetic, drawing us, by\nits attractive power, to live the best kind of life possible for\nus. This gives him a defense against the charge sometimes made\nagainst virtue theories that they simply embed the prevailing social\nconsensus into an account of human nature. Aristotle defines ethical\nvirtue as lying in a mean between excess and defect, and the mean is\ndetermined by the person of practical wisdom (actually the male,\nsince Aristotle is sexist on this point). He then gives a\nconventional account of the virtues such a person displays (such as\ncourage, literally manliness, which requires the right amount of fear\nand confidence, between cowardice and rashness). But the virtuous\nperson in each case acts \u2018for the sake of the noble (or beautiful)\u2019,\nand Aristotle continually associates the noble with the divine (e.g.,\nNE, 1115b12).\n\n\nThere are tensions in Aristotle's account of virtue and happiness. It\nis not clear whether the Nicomachean Ethics has a consistent\nview of the relation between the activity of contemplation and the\nother activities of a virtuous life (see Hare, God and\nMorality, chapter 1, and Sarah Broadie, Ethics with\nAristotle, chapter 7). But the connection of the highest human\nstate with the divine is pervasive in the text. One result of this\nconnection is the eudaimonism mentioned earlier. If the god does not\ncare about what is not divine (for this would be to become\nlike what is not divine), the highest and most god-like human\nalso does not care about other human beings except to the degree they\ncontribute to his own best state. This degree is not negligible, since\nhumans are social animals, and their well-being depends on the\nwell-being of the families and cities of which they are\nmembers. Aristotle is not preaching self-sufficiency in any sense that\nimplies we could be happy on our own, isolated from other human\nbeings. But our concern for the well-being of other people is always,\nfor him, contingent on our special relation to them. Within the\nhighest kind of friendship \u2018a friend is another self\u2019, he says, and\nwithin such friendship we care about friends for their own sake, but\nif the friend becomes divine and we do not, then the friendship is\nover (NE, 1159a7). We therefore do not want our friends to\nbecome gods, even though that would be the best thing for\nthem. Finally, Aristotle ties our happiness to our end (in Greek,\ntelos); for humans, as for all living things, the best state\nis its own activity in accordance with the natural function that is\nunique to each species. For humans the best state is happiness, and\nthe best activity within this state is contemplation (NE,\n1178b17\u201323).\n\n\nThe Epicureans and Stoics who followed Aristotle differed with each\nother and with him in many ways, but they agreed in tying morality and\nreligion together. For the Epicureans, the gods do not care about us,\nthough they are entertained by looking at our tragicomic lives (rather\nas we look at soap operas on television). We can be released from a\ngood deal of anxiety, the Epicureans thought, by realizing that the\ngods are not going to punish us. Our goal should be to be as like the\ngods as we can, enjoying ourselves without interruption, but for us\nthis means limiting our desires to what we can obtain without\nfrustration. They did not mean that our happiness is self-interested\nin any narrow sense, because they held that we can include others in\nour happiness by means of our sympathetic pleasures. The Stoics\nlikewise tied the best kind of human life, for them the life of the\nsage, to being like the divine. The sage follows nature in all his\ndesires and actions, and is thus the closest to the divine. One of the\nvirtues he will have is \u2018apathy\u2019 (in\nGreek apatheia), which does not mean listlessness, but\ndetachment from wanting anything other than what nature, or the god,\nis already providing. Like the Epicureans, the Stoics had an argument\nagainst any narrow self-interest, but this time based on their\nconception of right reason which is directed by the law common to all,\n\u2018which pervades everything and is the same as Zeus, lord of the\nordering of all that exists\u2019 (Diogenes Laertius, Lives of\nthe Philosophers, VII 88. For the views of the Epicureans and\nStoics about morality and religion, see Julia Annas, The Morality\nof Happiness, chapters 5 and 7.)\n2. The Hebrew Bible And The New Testament\n\n\nThe second line of thought to be traced in this entry starts with the\nHebrew Bible and continues with the Greek scriptures called by\nChristians \u2018The New Testament\u2019. Morality and religion are\nconnected in the Hebrew Bible primarily by the category of God's\ncommand. Such commands come already in the first chapter\nof Genesis. God created by command, for example \u2018Let\nthere be light\u2019 (Gen. 1:3). Then, after the creation of\nanimals, God gives the command, \u2018Be fruitful and\nmultiply\u2019, and repeats the command to the humans he creates in\nthe divine image (Gen. 1:22). In the second chapter God tells\nAdam that he is free to eat from any tree in the garden, but he must\nnot eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When Eve and\nAdam disobey and eat of that fruit, they are expelled from the\ngarden. There is a family of concepts here that is different from what\nwe met in Greek philosophy. God is setting up a kind of covenant by\nwhich humans will be blessed if they obey the commands God gives\nthem. Human disobedience is not explained in the text, except that the\nserpent says to Eve that they will not die if they eat the fruit, but\nwill be like God, knowing good and evil, and Eve sees the fruit as\ngood for food and pleasing to the eye and desirable for gaining\nwisdom. After they eat, Adam and Eve know that they are naked, and are\nashamed, and hide from God. There is a turning away from God and from\nobedience to God that characterizes this as a \u2018fall into\nsin\u2019. As the story goes on, and Cain kills Abel, evil spreads to\nall the people of the earth, and Genesis describes the basic\nstate as a corruption of the heart (6:9). This idea of a\nbasic orientation away from or towards God and God's commands becomes\nin the Patristic period of early Christianity the idea of a\nwill. There is no such idea in Plato or Aristotle, and no Greek word\nthat the English word \u2018will\u2019 properly translates.\n\n\nIn the Pentateuch, the story continues with Abraham, and God's command\nto leave his ancestral land and go to the land God promised to give\nhim and his offspring (Gen. 17:7\u20138). Then there is the\ncommand to Abraham to kill his son, a deed prevented at the last\nminute by the provision of a ram instead\n(Gen. 22:11\u201314). Abraham's great grandchildren end up\nin Egypt, because of famine, and the people of Israel suffer for\ngenerations under Pharaoh's yoke. Under Moses the people are finally\nliberated, and during their wanderings in the desert, Moses receives\nfrom God the Ten Commandments, in two tables or tablets\n(Exod. 20:1\u201317, 31:18). The first table concerns our\nobligations to God directly, to worship God alone and keep God's name\nholy, and keep the Sabbath. The second table concerns our obligations\nto other human beings, and all of the commands are negative (do not\nkill, commit adultery, steal, lie, or covet) except for the first,\nwhich tells us to honor our fathers and mothers. God's commands taken\ntogether give us the law (on some lists there are 613\nmitzvot, Hebrew for \u2018commands\u2019.) One more term belongs here,\nnamely \u2018kingdom\u2019. The Greeks had the notion of a kingdom, under a\nhuman king (though the Athenians were in the classical period\nsuspicious of such an arrangement). But they did not have the idea of\na kingdom of God, though there is something approaching this in some\nof the Stoics. This idea is explicable in terms of law, and is\nintroduced as such in Exodus in connection with the covenant\non Mt. Sinai. The kingdom is the realm in which the laws obtain.\n\n\nThis raises a question about the extent of this realm. The Ten\nCommandments are given in the context of a covenant with the people of\nIsrael, though there are references to God's intention to bless the\nwhole world through this covenant. The surrounding laws in the\nPentateuch include prescriptions and proscriptions about ritual purity\nand sacrifice and the use of the land that seem to apply to this\nparticular people in this particular place. But the covenant that God\nmakes with Noah after the flood is applicable to the whole human race,\nand universal scope is explicit in the Wisdom books, which make a\ncontinual connection between how we should live and how we were\ncreated as human beings. For example, in Proverbs 8 Wisdom\nraises her voice to all humankind, and says that she detests\nwickedness, which she goes on to describe in considerable detail. She\nsays that she was the artisan at God's side when God created the world\nand its inhabitants. Judaism distinguishes seven \u2018Noahide\u2019\nlaws given to Noah before the covenant with Abraham.\n\n\nIn the writings which Christians call \u2018The New Testament\u2019\nthe theme of God's commands is recapitulated. Jesus sums up the\ncommandments under two, the command to love God with all one's heart\nand soul and mind (see Deuteronomy 6:5), and the command to\nlove the neighbor as the self (see Leviticus 19:18). The\nfirst of these probably sums up the first \u2018table\u2019 of the\nTen Commandments to Moses, and the second sums up the second. The New\nTestament is unlike the Hebrew Bible, however, in presenting a\nnarrative about a man who is the perfect exemplification of obedience\nand who has a life without sin. New Testament scholars disagree about\nthe extent to which Jesus actually claimed to be God, but the\ntraditional interpretation is that he did make this claim; in any case\nthe Christian doctrine is that we can see in his life the clearest\npossible revelation in human terms both of what God is like and at the\nsame time of what our lives ought to be like. In the \u2018Sermon on\nthe Mount\u2019 (Matthew 5\u20137) Jesus issues a number of\nradical injunctions. He takes the commandments inside the heart; for\nexample, we are required not merely not to murder, but not to be\nangry, and not merely not to commit adultery, but not to lust\n(see Ezekiel 11:19, \u2018I will give them a heart of flesh,\nthat they may walk in my statutes.\u2019) We are told, if someone\nstrikes us on the right cheek, to turn to him also the left. Jesus\ntells us to love our enemies and those who hate and persecute us, and\nin this way he makes it clear that the love commandment is not based\non reciprocity (Matt 5:43\u201348; Luke\n6:27\u201336). Finally, when he is asked \u2018Who is my\nneighbor?\u2019, he tells the story (Luke 10) of a Samaritan\n(traditional enemies of the Jews) who met a wounded Jew he did not\nknow by the side of the road, was moved with compassion, and went out\nof his way to meet his needs; Jesus commends the Samaritan for being\n\u2018neighbor\u2019 to the wounded traveler.\n\n\nThe theme of self-sacrifice is clearest in the part of the narrative\nthat deals with Jesus' death. This event is understood in many\ndifferent ways in the New Testament, but one central theme is that\nJesus died on our behalf, an innocent man on behalf of the\nguilty. Jesus describes the paradigm of loving our neighbors as the\nwillingness to die for them. This theme is connected with our\nrelationship to God, which we violate by disobedience, but which is\nrestored by God's forgiveness through redemption. In Paul's letters\nespecially we are given a three-fold temporal location for the\nrelation of morality to God's work on our behalf. We are forgiven for\nour past failures on the basis of Jesus' sacrifice\n(Rom. 3:21\u201326). We are reconciled now with God\nthrough God's adoption of us in Christ\n(Rom. 8:14\u201319). And we are given the hope\nof future progress in holiness by the work of the Holy Spirit\n(Rom. 5:3\u20135). All of this theology requires more\ndetailed analysis, but this is not the place for it.\n\n\nThere is a contrast between the two traditions I have so far\ndescribed, namely the Greek and the Judeo-Christian. The idea of God\nthat is central in Greek philosophy is the idea of God attracting us,\nlike a kind of magnet, so that we desire to become more like God,\nthough there is a minority account by Socrates of receiving divine\ncommands. In the Jewish and Christian scriptures, the notion of God\ncommanding us is central. It is tempting to simplify this contrast by\nsaying that the Greeks favor the good, in their account of\nthe relation of morality and religion, and the Judeo-Christian account\nfavors the right or obligation. It is true that the notion of\nobligation makes most sense against the background of command. But the\npicture is over-simple because the Greeks had room in their account\nfor the constraint of desire; thus the temperate or brave person in\nAristotle's picture has desires for food or sex or safety that have to\nbe disciplined by the love of the noble. On the other side, the\nJudeo-Christian account adds God's love to the notion of God's\ncommand, so that the covenant in which the commands are embedded is a\ncovenant by which God blesses us, and we are given a route towards our\nhighest good which is union with God.\n3. The Middle Ages\n\n\nThe rest of the history to be described in this entry is a\ncross-fertilization of these two traditions or lines of thought. In\nthe patristic period, or the period of the early Fathers, it was\npredominantly Plato and the Stoics amongst the Greek philosophers\nwhose influence was felt. The Eastern and Western parts of the\nChristian church split during the period, and the Eastern church\nremained more comfortable than the Western with language about humans\nbeing deified (in Greek theosis). In the Western church,\nAugustine (354\u2013430) emphasized the gap between the world we are\nin as resident aliens and our citizenship in the heavenly Jerusalem,\nand even in our next life the distance between ourselves and God. He\ndescribes in the\nConfessions the route by which his heart or will, together\nwith his understanding, moved from paganism through Neo-Platonism to\nChristianity. The Neo-Platonists (such as Plotinus, 205-270) taught a\nworld-system of emanation, whereby the One (like Plato's Form of the\nGood) flowed into Intellect (the realm of the Forms) and from there\ninto the World-Soul and individual souls, where it encountered the\nrealm of bodies, from where it returned to itself (\u2018the flight of the\nalone to the alone\u2019). Augustine accepted that the Platonists taught,\nlike the beginning of the prologue of John, that the Word (in\nGreek, logos) is with God and is God, since the Intellect is\nthe mediating principle between the One and the Many (John\n1:1\u20135). Augustine held that Plato had asserted that the supreme good,\npossession of which alone gives us blessedness, is God, \u2018and therefore\n(Plato) thought that to be a philosopher is to be a lover of God.\u2019\n(De Civ. Dei VIII.8). But the Platonists did not teach, like\nthe end of John's prologue, that the Word is made flesh in\nJesus Christ, and so they did not have access to the way to salvation\nrevealed in Christ or God's grace to us through Christ's\ndeath. Nonetheless, it is surprising how far Augustine can go in\nrapprochement. The Forms, he says, are in the mind of God and God uses\nthem in the creation of the world. Human beings were created for union\nwith God, but they have the freedom to turn towards themselves instead\nof God. If they turn to God, they can receive divine illumination\nthrough a personal intuition of the eternal standards (the Forms). If\nthey turn towards themselves, they will lose the sense of the order of\ncreation, which the order of their own loves should reflect. Augustine\ngives primacy to the virtue of loving what ought to be loved,\nespecially God. In his homily on I John 4:8, he says, \u2018Love\nand do what you will.\u2019 But this is not a denial of the moral law. He\nheld that humans who truly love God will also act in accord with the\nother precepts of divine and moral law; though love not merely\nfulfills the cardinal virtues (wisdom, justice, courage and\ntemperance) but transforms them by supernatural grace.\n\n\nThe influence of Augustine in the subsequent history of ethics\nresulted from the fact that it was his synthesis of Christianity (the\nofficial religion of the Roman Empire after 325) and Greek philosophy\nthat survived the destruction of the Western Roman Empire, especially\nin the monasteries where the texts were still read. Boethius\n(c. 480\u2013524) gave us the definition of the concept of\n\u2018person\u2019 that has been fundamental to ethical theory. To\nunderstand this, we need to go back into the history of the\ndevelopment of the doctrine of the Trinity. The church had to explain\nhow the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit could be distinct and yet\nnot three different gods. They used, in Latin, the\nterm persona, which means \u2018role\u2019 but which was\nalso used by the grammarians to distinguish what we call \u2018first\nperson, second person and third person\u2019 pronouns and\nverb-forms. The same human being can be first person \u2018I\u2019,\nsecond person \u2018you\u2019, and third person \u2018he\u2019 or\n\u2018she\u2019, depending on the relations in which he or she\nstands. The doctrine of the Trinity comes to be understood in terms of\nthree persons, one God, with the persons standing in different\nrelations to each other. But then this term \u2018person\u2019 is\nalso used to understand the relation of the second person's divinity\nto his humanity. The church came to talk about one person with two\nnatures, the person standing under the natures. This had the merit of\nnot making either the humanity or the divinity less essential to who\nJesus was. Plato and Aristotle did not have any term that we can\ntranslate \u2018person\u2019 in the modern sense, as\nsomeone (as opposed to something) that stands under\nall his or her attributes. Boethius, however, defines\n\u2018person\u2019 as \u2018individual substance of rational\nnature,\u2019 a key step in the introduction of our present\nconcept.\n\n\nIn the West knowledge of most of Aristotle's texts was lost, but not\nin the East. They were translated into Syriac, and Arabic, and\neventually (in Muslim Spain) into Latin, and re-entered Christian\nEurope in the twelfth century accompanied by translations of the great\nArabic commentaries. In the initial prophetic period of Islam (CE\n610\u201332) the Qur'an was given to Mohammad, who explained it and\nreinforced it through his own teachings and practices. The notion of\nGod's (Allah's) commands is again central, and our obedience to these\ncommands is the basis of our eventual resurrection. Disputes about\npolitical authority in the period after Mohammad's death led to the\nsplit between Sunnis and Shiites. Within Sunni Muslim ethical theory\nin the Middle Ages two major alternative ways developed of thinking\nabout the relation between morality and religion. The first, the\nMu'tazilite, was given its most developed statement by \u2018Abd\nal-Jabbar from Basra (d. 1025). \u2018Abd al-Jabbar defines a\nwrongful act as one that deserves blame, and holds that the right and\nwrong character of acts is known immediately to human reason,\nindependently of revelation. These standards that we learn from reason\napply also to God, so that we can use them to judge what God is and is\nnot commanding us to do. He also teaches that humans have freedom, in\nthe sense of a power to perform both an act and its opposite, though\nnot at the same time. (For Mu'tazilite ethical theory, see Sophia\nVasalou,\nMoral Agents and Their Deserts: The Character of Mu'tazilite\nEthics and George Hourani, Islamic Rationalism: The Ethics of\n\u2018Abd al-Jabbar.) The second alternative was taught by al-Ashari\n(d. 935), who started off as a Mu'tazilite, but came to reject their\nview. He insists that God is subject to none and to no standard that\ncan fix bounds for Him. Nothing can be wrong for God, who sets the\nstandard of right and wrong. This means that \u2018if God declared lying to\nbe right, it would be right, and if He commanded it, none could\ngainsay Him\u2019 (The Theology of al-Ash'ari, 169-70). With\nrespect to our freedom, he holds that God gives us only the power to\ndo the act (not its opposite) and this power is simultaneous to the\nact and does not precede it. A figure contemporary with al-Ashari, but\nin some ways intermediate between Mu'tazilites and Asharites, is\nal-Maturidi of Samarqand (d. 944). He holds that because humans have\nthe tendency in their nature towards ugly or harmful actions as well\nas beautiful or beneficial ones, God has to reveal to us by command\nwhat to pursue and what to avoid. He also teaches that God gives us\ntwo different kinds of power, both the power simultaneous with the act\n(which is simply to do the act) and the power preceding the act (to\nchoose either the act or its opposite). (For the work of al-Maturidi,\nsee Ulrich Rudolph, Al-Maturidi and Sunni Theology in\nSamarkand.)\n\n\nMedieval reflection within Judaism about morality and religion has, as\nits most significant figure, Maimonides (d. 1204) who was born in\nMuslim Spain, and was familiar with much of the Muslim discussion of\nthese questions. The Guide of the Perplexed was written for\nyoung men who had read Aristotle and were worried about the tension\nbetween the views of the philosopher and their faith. Maimonides\nteaches that we do indeed have some access just as human beings to the\nrightness and wrongness of acts; but what renders conforming to these\nstandards obligatory is that God reveals them in special\nrevelation. The laws are obligatory whether we understand the reasons\nfor them or not, but sometimes we do see how it is beneficial to obey,\nand Maimonides is remarkably fertile in providing such reasons.\n\n\nThe reentry of Aristotle into Europe caused a rebirth (a\n\u2018renaissance\u2019), but it also gave rise to a crisis, because\nit threatened to undermine the harmony established from the time of\nAugustine between the authority of reason, as represented by Greek\nphilosophy, and the authority of faith, as represented by the\ndoctrines of the Christian church. There were especially three\n\u2018errors of Aristotle\u2019 that seemed threatening: his\nteaching that the world was eternal, his apparent denial of personal\nimmortality, and his denial of God's active agency in the world. (See,\nfor example, Bonaventure,\nIn Hexaemeron, VI.5 and In II Sent., lib. II, d.1,\npars 1, a.1, q.2.) These three issues (\u2018the world, the soul, and God\u2019)\nbecome in one form or another the focus of philosophical thought for\nthe next six centuries.\n\n\nThomas Aquinas (c. 1224\u201374) undertook the project of synthesis\nbetween Aristotle and Christianity, though his version of Christianity\nwas already deeply influenced by Augustine, and so by\nNeo-Platonism. Aquinas, like Aristotle, emphasized the ends\n(vegetative, animal and typically human) given to humans in the\nnatural order. He described both the cardinal virtues and the\ntheological virtues of faith, hope and love, but he did not feel the\ntension that current virtue ethicists sometimes feel between virtue\nand the following of rules or principles. The rules governing how we\nought to live are known, some of them by revelation, some of them by\nordinary natural experience and rational reflection. But Aquinas\nthought these rules consistent in the determination of our good, since\nGod only requires us to do what is consistent with our own\ngood. Aquinas's theory is eudaimonist; \u2018And so the will\nnaturally tends towards its own last end, for every man naturally\nwills beatitude. And from this natural willing are caused all other\nwillings, since whatever a man wills, he wills on account of the\nend.\u2019 (Summa Theologiae I, q.60. a.2) God's will is not\nexercised by arbitrary fiat; but what is good for some human being can\nbe understood as fitting for this kind of agent, in relation to the\npurpose this agent intends to accomplish, in the real environment of\nthe action, including other persons individually and collectively. The\nprinciples of natural moral law are the universal judgments made by\nright reasoning about the kinds of actions that are morally\nappropriate and inappropriate for human agents. They are thus, at\nleast in principle and at a highly general level, deducible from human\nnature. Aquinas held that reason, in knowing these principles, is\nparticipating in the eternal law, which is in the mind of God\n(Summa Theologiae I, q.91. a.2). Aquinas was not initially\nsuccessful in persuading the church to embrace Aristotle. In 1277 the\nBishop of Paris condemned 219 propositions (not all Thomist),\nincluding the thesis that a person virtuous in Aristotle's terms\n\u2018is sufficiently disposed for eternal happiness.\u2019 But in\nthe Counter-Reformation, the synthesis which Aquinas achieved became\nauthoritative in Roman Catholic education.\n\n\nAquinas was a Dominican friar. The other major order of friars, the\nFranciscan, had its own school of philosophy, starting with\nBonaventure (c. 1217\u201374), who held that while we can learn from\nboth Plato and Aristotle, and both are also in error, the greater\nerror is Aristotle's. One other major figure from this tradition is\nJohn Duns Scotus (literally John from Duns, the Scot,\nc. 1266\u20131308), and there are three significant differences\nbetween him and Aquinas on the relation between morality and\nreligion. First, Scotus is not a eudaimonist. He takes a double\naccount of motivation from Anselm (1033\u20131109), who made the\ndistinction between two affections of the will, the affection for\nadvantage (an inclination towards one's own happiness and perfection)\nand the affection for justice (an inclination towards what is good in\nitself independent of advantage) (Anselm, De Concordia 3.11,\n281:7\u201310; De Casu Diaboli 12, 255:8\u201311). Original\nsin is a ranking of advantage over justice, which needs to be reversed\nby God's assistance before we can be pleasing to God. Scotus says that\nwe should be willing to sacrifice our own happiness for God if God\nwere to require this. Second, he does not think that the moral law is\nself-evident or necessary. He takes the first table to be necessary,\nsince it derives (except for the \u2018every seventh day\u2019\nprovision of the command about the Sabbath) from the necessary\nprinciple that God is to be loved. But the second table is contingent,\nthough fitting our nature, and God could prescribe different commands\neven for human beings (Ord. I, dist. 44). One of his examples\nis the proscription on theft, which applies only to beings with\nproperty, and so not necessarily to human beings (since they are not\nnecessarily propertied). God also gives dispensation from the\ncommands, according to Scotus, for example the command to Abraham to\nkill Isaac (Ord III, suppl. Dist. 37). Third, Scotus denied\nthe application of teleology to non-intentional nature, and thus\ndeparted from the Aristotelian and Thomist view. This does not mean\nthat we have no natural end or\ntelos, but that this end is related to the intention of God\nin the same way a human artisan intends his or her products to have a\ncertain purpose (see Hare 2006, chapter 2).\n4. Modern Philosophy\n\n\nEurope experienced a second Renaissance when scholars fled\nConstantinople after its capture by the Muslims in 1453, and brought\nwith them Greek manuscripts that were previously inaccessible. In\nFlorence Marsilio Ficino (1433\u201399) identified Plato as the\nprimary ancient teacher of wisdom, and (like Bonaventure) cited\nAugustine as his guide in elevating Plato in this way. His choice of\nPlato was determined by the harmony he believed to exist between\nPlato's thought and the Christian faith, and he set about making Latin\ntranslations of all the Platonic texts so that this wisdom could be\navailable for his contemporaries who did not know Greek. He was also\nthe first Latin translator of Plotinus, the Neo-Platonist.\n\n\nMany of the central figures in the Reformation were humanists in the\nRenaissance sense (where there is no implication of atheism). But\nthere is also a fundamental similarity in the way the relation between\nmorality and religion is conceived between Scotus and the two\nReformers Martin Luther (1483\u20131546) and John Calvin\n(1509\u201364), though neither of them make the distinctions about\nnatural law that Scotus (the \u2018subtle doctor\u2019) does. Luther\nsays \u2018What God wills is not right because he ought or was bound\nso to will; on the contrary, what takes place must be right, because\nhe so wills.\u2019 (Bondage of the Will, Works,\npp. 195\u20136). Calvin says \u2018God's will is so much the highest\nrule of righteousness that whatever he wills, by the very fact that he\nwills it, must be considered righteous\u2019 (Institutes\n3. 23. 2). The historical connection between Scotus and the Reformers\ncan be traced through William of Ockham (d. 1349) and Gabriel Biel\n(1410\u201395). The Counter-Reformation in Roman Catholic Europe, on\nthe other hand, took the work of Aquinas as authoritative for\neducation. Francisco de Suarez (1548\u20131617) claimed that the\nprecepts of natural law can be distinguished into those (like\n\u2018Do good and avoid evil\u2019) which are known immediately and\nintuitively by all normal human beings, those (like \u2018Do no\ninjury to anyone\u2019) which require experience and thought to know\nthem, but which are then self-evident, and those (like \u2018Lying is\nalways immoral\u2019) which are not self-evident but can be derived\nfrom the more basic precepts (De Legibus, 2. 7. 5). However,\nSuarez accepted Scotus's double account of motivation.\n\n\nThe next two centuries in European philosophy can be described in\nterms of two lines of development, rationalism and empiricism, both of\nwhich led, in different ways, to the possibility of a greater\ndetachment of ethics from theology. The history of rationalism from\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716) is a history of re-establishing human knowledge on\nthe foundation of rational principles that could not be doubted, after\nmodern science started to shake the traditional foundations supported\nby the authority of Greek philosophy and the church. Descartes was not\nprimarily an ethicist, but he located the source of moral law\n(surprisingly for a rationalist) in God's will. The most important\nrationalist in ethics was Benedict de Spinoza (1623\u201377). He was\na Jew, but was condemned by his contemporary faith community as\nunorthodox. Like Descartes, he attempted to duplicate the methods of\ngeometry in philosophy. Substance, according to Spinoza, exists in\nitself and is conceived through itself (Ethics, I, def. 3);\nit is consequently one, infinite, and identical with God\n(Ethics, I, prop. 15). There is no such thing as natural law,\nsince all events in nature (\u2018God or Nature\u2019) are equally\nnatural. Everything in the universe is necessary, and there is no free\nwill, except in as far as Spinoza is in favor of calling someone free\nwho is led by reason ( Ethics, I, prop. 32). Each human mind\nis a limited aspect of the divine intellect. On this view (which has\nits antecedent in Stoicism) the human task is to move towards the\ngreatest possible rational control of human life. Leibniz was, like\nDescartes, not primarily an ethicist. He said, however, that\n\u2018the highest perfection of any thinking being lies in careful\nand constant pursuit of true happiness\u2019 (New Essays on Human\nUnderstanding, XXI, 51). The rationalists were not denying the\ncentrality of God in human moral life, but their emphasis was on the\naccess we have through the light of reason rather than through sacred\ntext or ecclesiastical authority.\n\n\nAfter Leibniz there was in Germany a long-running battle between the\nrationalists and the pietists, who tried to remain true to the goals\nof the Lutheran Reformation. Examples of the two schools are Christian\nWolff (1679\u20131754) and Christian August Crusius (1715\u201375),\nand we can understand Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804), like his\nteacher Martin Knutzen (1713\u201351), as trying to mediate between\nthe two. Wolff was a very successful popularizer of the thought of\nLeibniz, but fuller in his ethical system. He took from Leibniz the\nprinciple that we will always select what pleases us most, and the\nprinciple that pleasure is the apprehension of perfection, so that the\namount of pleasure we feel is proportional to the amount of perfection\nwe intuit (New Essays on Human Understanding, XXI, 41). He\nthought we are obligated to do what will make us and our condition, or\nthat of others, more perfect, and this is the law of nature that would\nbe binding on us even if (per impossible) God did not\nexist. He saw no problem about the connection between virtue and\nhappiness, since both of them result directly from our perfection, and\nno problem about the connection between virtue and duty, since a duty\nis simply an act in accordance with law, which prescribes the pursuit\nof perfection. His views were offensive to the pietists, because he\nclaimed that Confucius already knew (by reason) all that mattered\nabout morality, even though he did not know anything about\nChrist. Crusius by contrast accepted Scotus's double theory of\nmotivation, and held that there are actions that we ought to do\nregardless of any ends we have, even the end of our own perfection and\nhappiness. It is plausible to see here the origin of Kant's\ncategorical imperative. But he also added a third motivation, what he\ncalled \u2018the drive of conscience\u2019 which is \u2018the\nnatural drive to recognize a divine moral law\u2019 (\u201cA Guide\nto Rational Living,\u201d\nMoral Philosophy from Montaigne to Kant, \u00a7132, 574). His idea\nwas that we have within us this separate capacity to recognize divine\ncommand and to be drawn towards it out of a sense of dependence on the\nGod who prescribes the command to us, and will punish us if we disobey\n(though our motive should not be to avoid punishment) (Ibid.,\n\u00a7135). \n\n\nThe history of empiricism in Britain from Hobbes to Hume is also the\nhistory of the attempt to re-establish human knowledge, but not from\nabove (from indubitable principles of reason) but from below (from\nexperience and especially the experience of the senses). Thomas Hobbes\n(1588\u20131649) said that all reality is bodily (including God), and\nall events are motions in space. Willing, then, is a motion, and is\nmerely the last act of desire or aversion in any process of\ndeliberation. His view is that it is natural, and so reasonable, for\neach of us to aim solely at our own preservation or pleasure. In the\nstate of nature, humans are selfish, and their lives are\n\u2018solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u2019, a war of all\nagainst all (Leviathan, Ch. 13). The first precept of the law\nof nature is then for each of us, pursuing our own interest, \u2018to\nendeavor peace, as far as he has hope of attaining it; and when he\ncannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use, all helps, and advantages\nof war.\u2019 (Ibid., Ch. 14). The second precept is that\neach of us should be willing to lay down our natural rights to\neverything to the extent that others are also willing, and Hobbes\nconcludes with the need to subordinate ourselves to a sovereign who\nalone will be able to secure peace. The second and longest portion\nof Leviathan is devoted to religion, where Hobbes argues for\nthe authority of Scripture (\u2018God's word\u2019), which he thinks\nis needed for the authority of law. He argues for the authority in\nthe interpretation of Scripture to be given to that same\nearthly sovereign, and not to competing ecclesiastical authorities\n(whose competition had been seen to exacerbate the miseries of war\nboth in Britain and on the continent) (Ibid., Ch. 33).\n\n\nJohn Locke (1632\u20131704) followed Hobbes in deriving morality from\nour need to live together in peace given our natural discord, but he\ndenied that we are mechanically moved by our desires. He agreed with\nHobbes in saying that moral laws are God's imposition, but disagreed\nby making God's power and benevolence both necessary\nconditions for God's authority in this respect (Treatises,\nIV. XIII. 3). He also held that our reason can work out counsels or\nadvice about moral matters; but only God's imposition makes\nlaw (and hence obligation), and we only know about God's\nimposition from revelation (The Reasonableness of\nChristianity, 62\u20135). He therefore devoted considerable attention\nto justifying our belief in the reliability of revelation.\n\n\nThe deists (e.g., William Wollaston, 1659\u20131724) believed that\nhumans can reason from their experience of nature to the existence and\nsome of the attributes of God, that special revelation is accordingly\nunnecessary, that God does not intervene in human affairs (after\ncreation) and that the good life for humans finds adequate guidance in\nphilosophical ethics. Frances Hutcheson (1694\u20131746) was not a\ndeist, but does give a reading of the sort of guidance involved\nhere. He distinguished between objects that are naturally good, which\nexcite personal or selfish pleasure, and those that are morally good,\nwhich are advantageous to all persons affected. He took\nhimself to be giving a reading of moral goodness as agape,\nthe Greek word for the love of our neighbor that Jesus\nprescribes. This love is benevolence, Hutcheson said, and it is\nformulated in the principle \u2018That Action is best, which procures\nthe greatest Happiness for the greatest Numbers\u2019\n(Inquiry II, III, VIII). Because these definitions of natural\nand moral good produce a possible gap between the two, we need some\nway to believe that morality and happiness are coincident. Hutcheson\nthought that God has given us a moral sense for this purpose\n(Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions, II). This\nmoral sense responds to examples of benevolence with approbation and a\nunique kind of pleasure, and benevolence is the only thing it responds\nto, as it were the only signal it picks up. It is, like Scotus's\naffection for justice, not confined to our perception of\nadvantage. The result of our having moral sense is that when intending\nthe good of others, we \u2018undesignedly\u2019 end up promoting our\nown greatest good as well because we end up gratifying ourselves along\nwith others. God shows benevolence by first making us\nbenevolent and then giving us this moral sense that gets joy from the\napprobation of our benevolence. To contemporary British opponents of\nmoral sense theory, this seemed too rosy or benign a picture; our joy\nin approving benevolence is not enough to make morality and happiness\ncoincident. We need also obligation and divine sanction.\n\n\nJoseph Butler (1692\u20131752, Bishop of Bristol and then of Durham)\nheld that God's goodness consists in benevolence, in wanting us to be\nhappy, and that we should want the same for each other. He made the\nimportant point that something can be good for an agent because it is\nwhat he wants without this meaning that the content of what\nhe wants has anything to do with himself (Fifteen Sermons,\n126\u201327).\n\n\nDavid Hume (1711\u201376) is the first figure in this narrative who\ncan properly be attached to the Enlightenment, though this term means\nvery different things in Scotland, in France and in Germany. Hume held\nthat reason cannot command or move the human will. Since morals\nclearly do have an influence on actions and affections, \u2018it\nfollows that they cannot be derived from reason; and that because\nreason alone, as we have already proved, can never have any such\ninfluence\u2019 (Treatise III.1). For Hume an action, or\nsentiment, or character, is virtuous or vicious \u2018because its\nview causes a pleasure or uneasiness of a particular kind\u2019\n(Ibid., III.2). The denial of motive power to reason is part\nof his general skepticism. He accepted from Locke the principle that\nour knowledge is restricted to sense impressions from experience and\nlogically necessary relations of ideas in advance of experience (in\nLatin, a priori). From this principle he derived more radical\nconclusions than Locke had done. For example, we cannot know about\ncausation or the soul. The only thing we can know about morals is that\nwe get pleasure from the thought of some things and pain from the\nthought of others. Since the idea of morality implies something\nuniversal, there must be some sentiment of sympathy or (he later says)\nhumanity, which is common to all human beings, and which\n\u2018recommends the same object to general approbation\u2019\n(Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,\nIX. I. 221). Hume thought we could get conventional moral conclusions\nfrom these moral sentiments, which nature has fortunately given us. He\nwas also skeptical about any attempt to derive conclusions containing\n\u2018ought\u2019 from premises containing only \u2018is\u2019,\nthough scholars debate about the scope of the premises he is talking\nabout here. Probably he included premises about God's will or nature\nor action. This does not mean he was arguing against the existence of\nGod. He thought (like Calvin) that we cannot rely on rational proofs\nof God's existence, even though humans have what Calvin called a sense\nof the divine and Human called \u2018true religion\u2019. But Hume\nnever identified himself as an atheist, though he had opportunity in\nthe atheist circles he frequented in Paris, and his Dialogues on\nNatural Religion end with the sentiment that \u2018to be a\nphilosophical skeptic is, in a man of letters, the first and most\nessential step towards being a sound, believing Christian\u2019\n(Dialogues, part XII, penultimate paragraph). Some scholars\ntake this remark (like similar statements in Hobbes) as purely ironic,\nbut this goes beyond the evidence.\n\n\nThe Enlightenment in France had a more anti-clerical flavor (in part\nbecause of the history of Jansenism, unique to France), and for the\nfirst time in this narrative we meet genuine atheists, such as Baron\nd'Holbach (1723\u201389) who held not only that morality did not need\nreligion, but that religion, and especially Christianity, was its\nmajor impediment. Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Voltaire (1694-1778) was,\nespecially towards the end of his life, opposed to Christianity, but\nnot to religion in general (Letters of Voltaire and Frederick the\nGreat, letter 156). He accepted from the English deists the idea\nthat what is true in Christian teachings is the core of human values\nthat are universally true in all religions, and (like the German\nrationalists) he admired Confucius. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-78)\nsaid, famously, that mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in\nchains (The Social Contract, Ch. 1). This supposes a\ndisjunction between nature and contemporary society, and Rousseau held\nthat the life of primitive human beings was happy inasmuch as they\nknew how to live in accordance with their own innate needs; now we\nneed some kind of social contract to protect us from the corrupting\neffects of society upon the proper love of self. Nature is understood\nas the whole realm of being created by God, who guarantees its\ngoodness, unity, and order. Rousseau held that we do not need any\nintermediary between us and God, and we can attain salvation by\nreturning to nature in this high sense and by developing all our\nfaculties harmoniously. Our ultimate happiness is to feel ourselves at\none with the system that God created.\n\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) is the most important figure of the\nEnlightenment in Germany, but his project is different in many ways\nfrom those of his French contemporaries. He was brought up in a\npietist Lutheran family, and his system retains many features from,\nfor example, Crusius. But he was also indebted through Wolff to\nLeibniz. Moreover, he was \u2018awoken from his dogmatic\nslumbers\u2019 by reading Hume, though Kant is referring here to\nHume's attack on causation, not his ethical theory\n(Prolegomena, 4:260). Kant's mature project was to limit\nhuman knowledge \u2018in order to make room for faith\u2019\n(KrV, B xxx). He accepted from Hume that our knowledge is\nconfined within the limits of possible sense experience, but he did\nnot accept skeptical conclusions about causation or the soul. Reason\nis not confined, in his view, to the same limits as knowledge, and we\nare rationally required to hold beliefs about things as they are in\nthemselves, not merely things as they appear to us. In particular, we\nare required to believe in God, freedom and immortality. These are\nthree \u2018postulates of practical reason\u2019, required to make\nrational sense of the fact of moral obligation, the fact that we are\nunder the moral law (the \u2018categorical imperative\u2019) that\nrequires us to will the maxim of an action (the prescription of the\naction together with the reason for it) as a universal law (removing\nany self-preference) and to treat humanity in any person as always at\nthe same time an end and never merely as a means (Groundwork,\n4.421, 429). Kant thought that humans have to be able to believe that\nmorality in this demanding form is consistent in the long run with\nhappiness (both their own and that of the people they affect by their\nactions), if they are going to be able to persevere in the moral life\nwithout rational instability. He did not accept the three\ntraditional theoretical arguments for the existence of God\n(though he was sympathetic to a modest version of the teleological\nargument). But the practical argument was decisive for him,\nthough he held that it was possible to be morally good without being a\ntheist, despite such a position being rationally unstable.\n\n\nIn Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason he undertook\nthe project of using moral language in order to translate the four\nmain themes of Biblical revelation (accessible only to particular\npeople at particular times) into the revelation to Reason (accessible\nto all people at all times). This does not mean that he intended to\nreduce Biblical faith to morality, though some scholars have taken him\nthis way. The translated versions of Creation, Fall, Redemption and\nSecond Coming are as follows (see Hare 1996): Humans have an initial\npredisposition to the good, which is essential to them, but is\noverlaid with a propensity to evil, which is not essential to\nthem. Since they are born under \u2018the Evil Maxim\u2019 that\nsubordinates duty to happiness, they are unable by their own devices\nto reverse this ranking, and require \u2018an effect of grace\u2019\n(Religion, 6.53). Providence ushers in progress (though not\ncontinuous) towards an \u2018ethical commonwealth\u2019 in which we\ntogether make the moral law our own law, by appropriating it as\nauthoritative for our own lives (this is what Kant means by\n\u2018autonomy\u2019) (Religion, 6.98\u201399;\nGroundwork, 4.433\u201334). \n\n\nA whole succession of Kant's followers tried to \u2018go\nbeyond\u2019 Kant by showing that there was finally no need to make\nthe separation between our knowledge and the thing-in-itself beyond\nour knowledge. One key step in departing from the surviving influence\nin Kant of Lutheran pietism was taken by Johann Gottlieb Fichte\n(1762\u20131814), who identified (as Kant did not) the will of the\nindividual with the infinite Ego which is ordering the universe\nmorally. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770\u20131831) accomplished\na somewhat similar end by proposing that we should make the truth of\nideas relative to their original historical context against the\nbackground of a history that is progressing towards a final stage of\n\u2018absolute knowledge\u2019, in which Spirit (in\nGerman Geist, which means also \u2018mind\u2019)\nunderstands that reality is its own creation and there is no\n\u2018beyond\u2019 for it to know. Hegel is giving a philosophical\naccount of the Biblical notion of all things returning to God,\n\u2018so that God may be all in all.\u2019 (I Cor. 15:28)\nIn this world-history, Hegel located the Reformation as \u2018the\nall-enlightening sun\u2019 of the bright day that is our modern time\n(The Philosophy of History, 412). He thought that Geist moves\nimmanently through human history, and that the various stages of\nknowledge are also stages of freedom, each stage producing first its\nown internal contradiction, and then a radical transition into a new\nstage. The stage of absolute freedom will be one in which all members\nfreely by reason endorse the organic community and the concrete\ninstitutions in which they actually live (Phenomenology, BB,\nVI, B, III).\n\n\nOne of Hegel's opponents was Arthur Schopenhauer (1799\u20131860),\nthe philosopher of pessimism. Schopenhauer thought that Hegel had\nstrayed from the Kantian truth that there is a thing-in-itself beyond\nappearance, and that the Will is such a thing. He differed from Kant,\nhowever, in seeing the Will as the source of all our endless\nsuffering, a blind striving power without ultimate purpose or design\n(The World as Will and Representation, \u00a756 p. 310 and\n\u00a757 p. 311). It is, moreover, one universal Will that underlies\nthe wills of all separate individuals. The intellect and its ideas are\nsimply the Will's servant. On this view, there is no happiness for us,\nand our only consolation is a (quasi-Buddhist) release from the Will\nto the limited extent we can attain it, especially through aesthetic\nenjoyment.\n\n\nHegel's followers split into what are sometimes called \u2018Right\nHegelians\u2019 and \u2018Left Hegelians\u2019 (or \u2018Young\nHegelians\u2019). Right Hegelians promoted the generally positive\nview of the Prussian state that Hegel expressed in the Philosophy\nof Right. Left Hegelians rejected it, and with it the Protestant\nChristianity which they saw as its vehicle. In this way Hegel's\npeculiar way of promoting Christianity ended up causing its vehement\nrejection by thinkers who shared many of his social ideals. David\nFriedrich Strauss (1808\u201374) wrote The Life of Jesus\nCritically Examined, launching the historical-critical method of\nBiblical scholarship with the suggestion that much of the Biblical\naccount is myth or \u2018unconscious invention\u2019 that needs to\nbe separated out from the historical account. Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach\n(1804\u201372) wrote The Essence of Christianity in which he\npictured all religion as the means by which \u2018man projects his\nbeing into objectivity, and then again makes himself an object to this\nprojected image of himself\u2019 (The Essence of\nChristianity, 30). Feuerbach thought religion resulted from\nhumanity's alienation from itself, and philosophy needed to destroy\nthe religious illusion so that we could learn to love humankind and\nnot divert this love onto an imaginary object. Karl Marx\n(1818\u201383) followed Feuerbach in this diagnosis of religion, but\nhe was interested primarily in social and political relations rather\nthan psychology. He became suspicious of theory (for example Hegel's),\non the grounds that theory is itself a symptom of the power structures\nin the societies that produce it. \u201cTheory,\u201d Marx writes,\n\u201cis realized in a people only in so far as it is a realization\nof the people's needs\u201d (\u201cCritique of Hegel's Philosophy of\nRight,\u201d Early Writings, 252). And\n\u2018ideologies\u2019 and \u2018religion,\u2019 he believes,\narise from \u201cconditions that require [these] illusions\u201d\n(Ibid., 244). Marx returned to Hegel's thoughts about work revealing\nto the worker his value through what the worker produces, but Marx\nargues that under capitalism the worker was alienated from this\nproduct because other people owned both the product and the means of\nproducing it. Marx urged that the only way to prevent this was to\ndestroy the institution of private property (\u201cEconomic and\nPhilosophic Manuscripts,\u201d Early Writings, 348). Thus he\nbelieved, like Hegel, in progress through history towards freedom, but\nhe thought it would take Communist revolution to bring this about.\n\n\nA very different response to Hegel (and Kant) is found in the work of\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u201355), a religious thinker who\nstarted, like Hegel and Kant, from Lutheranism. Kierkegaard mocked\nHegel constantly for presuming to understand the whole system in which\nhuman history is embedded, while still being located in a particular\nsmall part of it. On the other hand, he used Hegelian categories of\nthought himself, especially in his idea of the aesthetic life, the\nethical life and the religious life as stages through which human\nbeings develop by means of first internal contradiction and then\nradical transition. Kierkegaard's relation with Kant was problematic\nas well. In Either/Or he caricatured Kant's ethical thought\n(as well as Hegel's) in the person of Judge William, who is stuck\nwithin the ethical life and has not been able to reach the life of\nfaith. On the other hand, his own description of the religious life is\nfull of echoes of Kant's Religion within the Boundaries of Mere\nReason. Kierkegaard wrote most of his work pseudonymously, taking\non the names of characters who lived the lives he describes. In the\naesthetic life the goal is to keep at bay the boredom that is\nconstantly threatening, and this requires enough distance from one's\nprojects that one is not stuck with them but can flit from engagement\nto engagement without pain (Either/Or, II. 77). This life\ndeconstructs, because it requires (in order to sustain interest) the\nvery commitment that it also rejects. The transition is accomplished\nby making a choice for one's life as a whole from a position that is\nnot attached to any particular project, a radical choice that requires\nadmitting the aesthetic life has been a failure. In this choice one\ndiscovers freedom, and thus the ethical life (Either/Or,\nII. 188). But this life too deconstructs, because it sets up the goal\nof living by a demand, the moral law, that is higher than we can live\nby our own human devices. Kierkegaard thought we have to realize that\nGod is (contrary to Fichte) \u2018another\u2019 (Sickness unto\nDeath xi 128), with whom we have to relate, and whose assistance\nis necessary even for the kind of repentance that is the transition\ninto the religious life. He also suggested that within the religious\nlife, there is a \u2018repetition\u2019 of the aesthetic life and\nthe ethical life, though in a transformed version.\n\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900) was the son of a Lutheran pastor\nin Prussia. He was trained as a classical philologist, and his first\nbook, The Birth of Tragedy, was an account of the origin and\ndeath of ancient Greek tragedy. Nietzsche was deeply influenced by\nSchopenhauer, especially his view of the will (which Nietzsche called\n\u2018the Will to Power\u2019), and was first attracted and then\nrepelled by Wagner, who was also one of Schopenhauer's disciples. The\nbreaking point seems to have been\nWagner's Parsifal. Nietzsche by this time was opposed to\northodox Christianity and was promoting Ancient Greece instead, and he\nthought that Wagner was betraying his integrity by using an\n\u2018anti-Greek\u2019 Christian story for the opera. Nietzsche saw\nclearly the intimate link between Christianity and the ethical\ntheories of his predecessors in Europe, especially Kant. In On the\nGenealogy of Morals, he says, \u2018The advent of the Christian\nGod, as the maximum god attained so far, was therefore accompanied by\nthe maximum feeling of guilty indebtedness on earth. Presuming we have\ngradually entered upon the reverse course, there is no small\nprobability that with the irresistible decline of faith in the\nChristian God, there is now also a considerable decline in mankind's\nfeeling of guilt\u2019 (On the Genealogy of Morals,\n90\u20131). This is the \u2018death of God\u2019 which Nietzsche\nannounced, and which he predicted would also be the end of Kantian\nethics (The Gay Science, \u00a7108, 125, 343). It is harder\nto know what Nietzsche was for, than what he was against. This is\npartly an inheritance from Schopenhauer, who thought any system of\nconstructive ethical thought a delusion. But Nietzsche clearly admired\nthe Ancient Greeks, and thought we would be better off with a\n\u2018master\u2019 morality like theirs, rather than a\n\u2018slave\u2019 morality like Christianity. \u2018Mastery over\nhimself also necessarily gives him mastery over circumstances, over\nnature, and over all more short-willed and unreliable creatures\u2019\n(Genealogy, 59-60). By this last clause, he meant mastery\nover other people, and the model of this mastery is the\n\u2018overman\u2019 who is free of the resentment by the weak of the\nstrong that Nietzsche thought lay at the basis of Christian\nethics.\n\n\nTo return to Britain, Hume had a number of successors who accepted the\nview (which Hume took from Hutcheson) that our fundamental obligation\nis to work for the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Four are\nespecially significant. William Paley (1743\u20131805) thought he\ncould demonstrate that morality derived from the will of God and\nrequired promoting the happiness of all, that happiness was the sum of\npleasures, and that we need to believe that God is the final granter\nof happiness if we are to sustain motivation to do what we know we\nought to do (The Principles of Moral and Political\nPhilosophy, II. 4). Jeremy Bentham (1748\u20131832) rejected\nthis theological context. His grounds were radically empiricist, that\nthe only \u2018real\u2019 entities are publicly observable, and so\ndo not include God (or, for that matter, right or time or relations or\nqualities). He thought he could provide a scientific calculus of\npleasures, where the unit that stays constant is the minimum state of\nsensibility that can be distinguished from indifference. He thought we\ncould then separate different \u2018dimensions\u2019 in which these\nunits vary, such as intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity (how\nsoon the pleasures will come), fecundity (how many other pleasures\nthis pleasure will produce) and purity. Discarding the theological\ncontext made moral motivation problematic, for why should we expect\n(without God) more units of pleasure for ourselves by contributing to\nthe greater pleasure of others? Bentham's solution was to hope that\nlaw and social custom could provide individuals with adequate motives\nthrough the threat of social sanctions, and that what he called\n\u2018deontology\u2019 (which is personal or private morality) could\nmobilize hidden or long-range interests that were already present but\nobscure.\n\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806\u201373) was raised on strict utilitarian\nprinciples by his father, a follower of Bentham. Unlike Bentham,\nhowever, Mill accepted that there are qualitative differences in\npleasures simply as pleasures, and he thought that the higher\npleasures were those of the intellect, the feelings and imagination,\nand the moral sentiments. He observed that those who have experienced\nboth these and the lower pleasures, tend to prefer the former. At the\nage of twenty he had a collapse and a prolonged period of\n\u2018melancholy\u2019. He realized that his education had neglected\nthe culture or cultivation of\nfeelings, of which hope is a primary instance\n(Autobiography, 1. 84). In his Three Essays on\nReligion (published posthumously in 1874) he returned to the idea\nof hope, saying that \u2018the indulgence of hope with regard to the\ngovernment of the universe and the destiny of man after death, while\nwe recognize as a clear truth that we have no ground for more than a\nhope, is legitimate and philosophically defensible\u2019; without\nsuch hope, we are kept down by \u2018the disastrous feeling of\n\u201cnot worth while\u201d\u2019 (Three Essays\n249\u201350). Mill did not believe, however, that God was omnipotent,\ngiven all the evil in the world, and he insisted, like Kant, that we\nhave to be God's co-workers, not merely passive recipients of God's\nassistance.\n\n\nHenry Sidgwick (1838\u20131900) in Methods of Ethics\ndistinguished three methods: Intuitionism (which is, roughly, the\ncommon sense morality that some things, like deliberate ingratitude to\na benefactor, are self-evidently wrong in themselves independently of\ntheir consequences), Egoistic Hedonism (the view that self-evidently\nan individual ought to aim at a maximum balance of happiness for\nherself, where this is understood as the greatest balance of pleasure\nover pain), and Utilitarianism or Universalistic Hedonism, (the view\nthat self-evidently she ought to aim at the maximum balance of\nhappiness for all sentient beings present and future, whatever the\ncost to herself). Of these three, he rejected the first, on the\ngrounds that no concrete ethical principles are self-evident, and that\nwhen they conflict (as they do) we have to take consequences into\naccount in order to decide how to act. But Sidgwick found the relation\nbetween the other two methods much more problematic. Each principle\nseparately seemed to him self-evident, but when taken together they\nseems to be mutually inconsistent. He considered two solutions,\npsychological and metaphysical. The psychological solution was to\nbring in the pleasures and pains of sympathy, so that if we do good to\nall we end up (because of these pleasures) making ourselves\nhappiest. Sidgwick rejected this on the basis that sympathy is\ninevitably limited in its range, and we feel it most towards those\nclosest to us, so that even if we include sympathetic pleasures and\npains under Egoism, it will tend to increase the divergence between\nEgoistic and Utilitarian conduct, rather than bring them closer\ntogether. The metaphysical solution was to bring in a god who desires\nthe greatest total good of all living things, and who will reward and\npunish in accordance with this desire. Sidgwick recognized this as a\nreturn to the utilitarianism of Paley (Compare Methods of\nEthics, II. 1, 2 and IV. 4, 5). He thought this solution was both\nnecessary and sufficient to remove the contradiction in ethics. But\nthis was only a reason to accept it, if in general it is reasonable to\naccept certain principles (such as the Uniformity of Nature) which are\nnot self-evident and which cannot be proved, but which bring order and\ncoherence into a central part of our thought. Sidgwick did not commit\nhimself to an answer to this, one way or the other.\n5. Contemporary Philosophy\n\n\nIn the twentieth century professional philosophy in the West divided\nup into two streams, sometimes called \u2018Analytic\u2019 and\n\u2018Continental\u2019, and there were periods during which the two\nschools lost contact with each other. Towards the end of the century,\nhowever, there were more philosophers who could speak the languages of\nboth traditions. The beginning of the analytic school is sometimes\nlocated with the rejection of a neo-Hegelian idealism by G.E. Moore\n(1873-1958). One way to characterize the two schools is that the\nContinental school continued to read and be influenced by Hegel, and\nthe Analytic school (with some exceptions) did not. Another way to\nmake the distinction is geographical; the analytic school is located\nprimarily in Britain, Scandinavia and N. America, and the continental\nschool in the rest of Europe, in Latin America and in certain schools\nin N. America.\n\n\nWe will start with some figures from the Continental school, and then\nmove to the analytic (which is this writer's own). Martin Heidegger\n(1889\u20131976) was initially trained as a theologian, and wrote his\ndissertation on what he took to be a work of Duns Scotus. He took an\nappointment under Edmund Husserl (1855\u20131938) at Freiburg, and\nwas then appointed to succeed him in his chair. Husserl's program of\n\u2018phenomenology\u2019 was to recover a sense of certainty about\nthe world by studying in exhaustive detail the cognitive structure of\nappearance. Heidegger departed from Husserl in approaching Being\nthrough a focus on \u2018Human Being\u2019 (in\nGerman Dasein) concerned above all for its fate in an alien\nworld, or as \u2018anxiety\u2019 (Angst) towards death\n(see Being and Time I. 6). In this sense he is the first\nexistentialist, though he did not use the term. Heidegger emphasized\nthat we are \u2018thrown\u2019 into a world that is not\n\u2018home\u2019, and we have a radical choice about what\npossibilities for ourselves we will make actual. Heidegger drew here\nfrom Kierkegaard, and he is also similar in describing the danger of\nfalling back into mere conventionality, what Heidegger calls\n\u2018the They\u2019 (das Man). On the other hand he is\nunlike Kierkegaard in thinking of traditional Christianity as just one\nmore convention making authentic existence more difficult. In\nHeidegger, as in Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, it is hard to find a\npositive or constructive ethics. Heidegger's position is somewhat\ncompromised, moreover, by his initial embrace of the Nazi party. In\nhis later work he moved increasingly towards a kind of quasi-religious\nmysticism. His Romantic hatred of the modern world and his distrust of\nsystem-building led to the espousal of either silence or poetry as the\nbest way to be open to the \u2018something\u2019 (sometimes he says\n\u2018the earth\u2019) which reveals itself only as\n\u2018self-secluding\u2019 or hiding itself away from our various\nconceptualizations. He held the hope that through poetry, and in\nparticular the poetry of H\u00f6lderlin, we might be able to still\nsense something of the unknown god who appears \u2018as the one who\nremains unknown,\u2019 who is quite different from the object of\ntheology or piety, but who can bring us back to the Being we have long\nlost sight of (Poetry, Language, Thought, 222).\n\n\nJean-Paul Sartre (1905-80) did use the label\n\u2018existentialist\u2019, and said that \u2018Existentialism is\nnothing else than an attempt to draw all the consequences of a\ncoherent atheist position\u2019 (Existentialism and Human\nEmotions, 51). He denied (like Scotus) that the moral law could\nbe deduced from human nature, but this was because (unlike Scotus) he\nthought that we give ourselves our own essences by the choices we\nmake. His slogan was, \u2018Existence precedes essence\u2019 (Ibid.,\n13). \u2018Essence\u2019 is here the defining property of a thing,\nand Sartre gave the example of a paper cutter, which is given its\ndefinition by the artisan who makes it. Sartre said that when people\nbelieved God made human beings, they could believe humans had a\nGod-given essence; but now that we do not believe this, we have\nrealized that humans give themselves their own essences (\u2018First\nof all, man exists, turns up, appears on the scene, and, only\nafterwards, defines himself.\u2019 Ibid., 15). On this view there are\nno outside commands to appeal to for legitimation, and we are\ncondemned to our own freedom. Sartre thought of human beings as trying\nto be God (on a Hegelian account of what God is), even though there is\nno God. This is an inevitably fruitless undertaking, which he called\n\u2018anguish\u2019. Moreover, we inevitably desire to choose not\njust for ourselves, but for the world. We want, like God, to create\nhumankind in our own image, \u2018If I want to marry, to have\nchildren, even if this marriage depends solely on my own circumstances\nor passion or wish, I am involving all humanity in monogamy and not\nmerely myself. Therefore, I am responsible for myself and for everyone\nelse. I am creating a certain image of man of my own choosing. In\nchoosing myself, I choose man\u2019 (Ibid., 18). To recognize that\nthis project does not make sense is required by honesty, and to hide\nthis from ourselves is \u2018bad faith\u2019. One form of bad faith\nis to pretend that there is a God who is giving us our tasks. Another\nis to pretend that there is a \u2018human nature\u2019 that is doing\nthe same thing. To live authentically is to realize both that we\ncreate these tasks for ourselves, and that they are futile.\n\n\nThe twentieth century also saw, within Roman Catholicism, forms of\nChristian Existentialism and new adaptations of the system of Thomas\nAquinas. Gabriel Marcel (1889\u20131973), like Heidegger, was\nconcerned with the nature of Being as it appears to human being, but\nhe tried to show that there are experiences of love, joy, hope and\nfaith which, as understood from within, give us reason to\nbelieve in an inexhaustible Presence, which is God. Jacques Maritain\n(1882\u20131973) developed a form of Thomism that retained the\nnatural law, but regarded ethical judgment as not purely cognitive but\nguided by pre-conceptual affective inclinations. He gave more place to\nhistory than traditional Thomism did, allowing for development in the\nhuman knowledge of natural law, and he defended democracy as the\nappropriate way for human persons to attain freedom and dignity. The\nnotion of the value of the person and the capacities given to persons\nby their creator was at the center of the \u2018personalism\u2019 of\nPope John Paul II's\nThe Acting Person (1979), influenced by Max Scheler\n(1874\u20131928).\n\n\nNatural law theory has been taken up and modified more recently by\nthree philosophers who write in a style closer to the analytic\ntradition, John Finnis, Alastair MacIntyre and Jean Porter. Finnis\nholds that our knowledge of the fundamental moral truths is\nself-evident, and so is not deduced from human nature. His Natural\nLaw and Natural Rights (1980) was a landmark in integrating the\nmodern vocabulary and grammar of rights into the tradition of Natural\nLaw. MacIntyre, who has been on a long journey back from Marxism to\nThomism, holds that we can know what kind of life we ought to live on\nthe basis of knowing our natural end, which he now identifies in\ntheological terms. In After Virtue (1981) he is still\ninfluenced by a Hegelian historicism, and holds that the only way to\nsettle rival knowledge claims is to see how successfully each can\naccount for the shape taken by its rivals. A different account of\nnatural law is found in Porter, who in Nature as Reason\n(2005) retains the view that our final motivation is our own happiness\nand perfection, but rejects the view that we can deduce absolute\naction-guiding moral principles from human nature. Another\ncontemporary school is virtue ethics, for example Philippa Foot in\nNatural Goodness (2001) and Rosalind Hursthouse in On\nVirtue Ethics (1999). They are not Roman Catholic but they are\nstrongly influenced by Aristotle and Aquinas. They emphasize the\nnotion of virtue which belongs to human nature just as bees have\nstings. Hursthouse ends her book by saying that we have to hold onto\nthe hope that we can live together, not at each other's\nexpense, a hope which she says used to be called belief in (God's)\nProvidence (On Virtue Ethics, 265). One final contribution to\nbe mentioned here is Linda Zagzebski's Divine Motivation\nTheory (2004) which proposes, as an alternative to divine command\ntheory, that we can understand all moral normatively in terms of the\nnotion of a good emotion, and that God's emotions are the best\nexemplar. We will return to the rebirth of divine command theory at\nthe end of this entry.\n\n\nMichel Foucault (1926\u201384) followed Nietzsche in aspiring to\nuncover the \u2018genealogy\u2019 of various contemporary forms of\nthought and practice (he was concerned, for example, with our\ntreatment of sexuality and mental illness), and how relations of power\nand domination have produced \u2018discourses of truth\u2019\n(\u201cTruth and Power,\u201d Power, 131). In his later\nwork he described four different aspects of the \u2018practice of the\nself\u2019: We select the desires, acts, and thoughts that we attend\nto morally, we recognize ourselves as morally bound by some particular\nground, e.g., divine commands, or rationality, or human nature, we\ntransform ourselves into ethical subjects by some set of techniques,\ne.g., meditation or mortification or consciousness-raising, and\nfinally, we propose a \u2018telos\u2019 or goal, the way of\nlife or mode of being that the subject is aiming at, e.g.,\nself-mastery, tranquility or purification. Foucault criticized\nChristian conventions that tend to take morality as a juristic and\noften universal code of laws, and to ignore the creative practice of\nself-making. Even if Christian and post-Christian moralists turn their\nattention to self-expression, he thought they tend to focus on the\nconfession of truth about oneself, a mode of expression which is\nhistorically linked to the church and the modern\npsycho-sciences. Foucault preferred stressing our freedom to form\nourselves as ethical subjects, and develop \u2018a new form of\nright\u2019 and a \u2018non-disciplinary form of power\u2019\n(\u201cDisciplinary Power and Subjection,\u201d\nPower, 242). He did not, however, tell us much more about\nwhat these new forms would be like.\n\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas (1929-) proposed a \u2018communicative\nethics\u2019 that develops the Kantian element in Marxism (The\nTheory of Communicative Action, Vols. I and II). By analyzing the\nstructure of communication (using speech-act theory developed in\nanalytic philosophy) he lays out a procedure that will rationally\njustify norms, though he does not claim to know what norms a society\nwill adopt by using this procedure. The two ideas behind this\nprocedure are that norms are valid if they receive the consent of all\nthe affected parties in unconstrained practical communication, and if\nthe consequences of the general observance of the norms (in terms of\nhow each person's interests are affected) are acceptable to\nall. Habermas thinks he fulfills in this way Hegel's aim of\nreconciling the individual and society, because the communication\nprocess extends individuals beyond their private perspectives in the\nprocess of reaching agreement. Religious convictions need to be left\nbehind when entering the public square, on this scheme, because they\nare not communicable in the way the procedure requires. In recent work\nhe has modified this position, by recognizing that certain religious\nforms require their adherents to speak in an explicitly religious way\nwhen advancing their prescriptions for public life, and it is\ndiscriminatory to try to prevent their doing so.\n\n\nWithin contemporary Jewish ethics mention should be made of Martin\nBuber (1878\u20131965) and Emmanuel Levinas (1906\u201395). Buber's\nform of existentialism emphasized the I-You relationship, which exists\nnot only between human beings but (out of that) between human beings\nand God. When we reject I-You relationship, we return to I-It\nrelations, governed by our impositions of our own conceptualizations\non objects. Buber said these two relations are\nexhaustive. \u2018There is no I as such but only the I of the basic\nword I-You and the I of the basic word I-It.\u2019 (I and\nThou, 54). Levinas studied under Husserl, and knew Heidegger,\nwhose work he first embraced and then rejected. His focus, like\nBuber's, was on the \u2018ethics of the Other\u2019, and he held\nthat the face of the Other makes a demand on us even before we\nrecognize our freedom to accept it or reject it. To meet the Other is\nto have the idea of Infinity (Ethics and Infinity,\n90\u20131).\n\n\nWe are sometimes said to live now in a \u2018post-modern\u2019\nage. This term is problematic in various ways. As used within\narchitectural theory in the 1960's and 1970's it had a relatively\nclear sense. There was a recognizable style that either borrowed bits\nand pieces from styles of the past, or mocked the very idea (in\nmodernist architecture) of essential functionality. In philosophy, the\nterm is less clearly definable. It combines a distaste for\n\u2018meta-narratives\u2019 and a rejection of any form of\nfoundationalism. The effect on philosophical thinking about the\nrelation between morality and religion is two-fold. On the one hand,\nthe modernist rejection of religion on the basis of a foundationalist\nempiricism is itself rejected. This makes the current climate more\nhospitable to religious language than it was for most of the twentieth\ncentury. But on the other hand, the distaste for over-arching theory\nmeans that religious meta-narratives are suspect to the same degree as\nany other, and the hospitality is more likely to be towards bits and\npieces of traditional theology than to any theological system as a\nwhole. Habermas uses the term \u2018post-secular age\u2019 to\ndescribe our current condition, in which the secularization hypothesis\n(that religion was destined to wither away under the impact of science\nand education) has apparently failed.\n\n\nMention should be made of some movements that are not philosophical in\na professional sense, but are important in understanding the relation\nbetween morality and religion. Liberation theology, of which a leading\nspokesman from Latin America is Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez (1928-), has\nattempted to reconcile the Christian gospel with a commitment\n(influenced by Marxist categories) to revolution to relieve the\ncondition of the oppressed. The civil rights movement (drawing heavily\non Exodus), feminist ethics, animal liberation, environmental\nethics, and the gay rights and children's rights movements have shown\nspecial sensitivity to the moral status of some particular oppressed\nclass. The leadership of some of these movements has been religiously\ncommitted, while the leadership of others has not. At the same time,\nthe notion of human rights, or justified claims by every\nhuman being, has grown in global reach, partly through the various\ninstrumentalities of the United Nations. There has, however, been less\nconsensus on the question of how to justify human\nrights. There are theological justifications, deriving from the image\nof God in every human being, or the command to love the neighbor, or\nthe covenant between God and humanity (see Wolterstorff,\nJustice: Rights and Wrongs, chapter 16). Whether\nthere is a non-theological justification is not yet clear. Finally,\nthere has also been a burst of activity in professional ethics, such\nas medical ethics, engineering ethics, and business ethics. This has\nnot been associated with any one school of philosophy rather than\nanother. The connection of religion with these developments has been\nvariable. In some cases (e.g., medical ethics) the initial impetus for\nthe new sub-discipline was strongly influenced by theology, and in\nother cases not.\n\n\nThe origin of analytic philosophy can be associated with\nG.E. Moore. His Principia Ethica (1903) can be regarded as\nthe first major ethical document of the school. He was strongly\ninfluenced by Sidgwick at Cambridge, but rejected Sidgwick's negative\nviews about intuitionism. He thought that intrinsic goodness was a\nreal property of things, even though (like the number two) it does not\nexist in time and is not the object of sense experience. He explicitly\naligned himself here with Plato and against the class of empiricist\nphilosophers, \u2018to which most Englishmen have belonged\u2019\n(Principia Ethica, 162). His predecessors, Moore thought, had\nalmost all committed the error, which he called \u2018the\nnaturalistic fallacy,\u2019 of trying to define this value property\nby identifying it with a non-evaluative property. For example, they\nproposed that goodness is pleasure, or what produces pleasure. But\nwhatever non-evaluative property we try to say goodness is identical\nto, we will find that it remains an open question whether that\nproperty is in fact good. For example, it makes sense to ask whether\npleasure or the production of pleasure is good. This is true also if\nwe propose a supernatural property to identify with goodness, for\nexample the property of being commanded by God. It still makes sense\nto ask whether what God commands is good. This question cannot be the\nsame as the question \u2018Is what God commands what God\ncommands?\u2019 which is not still an open question. Moore thought\nthat if these questions are different, then the two properties,\ngoodness and being commanded by God, cannot be the same, and to say\n(by way of a definition) that they are the same is to commit the\nfallacy. Intrinsic goodness, Moore said, is a simple non-natural\nproperty (i.e., neither natural nor supernatural) and indefinable. He\nthought we had a special form of cognition that he called\n\u2018intuition,\u2019 which gives us access to such properties. By\nthis he meant that the access was not based on inference or argument,\nbut was self-evident (though we could still get it wrong, just as we\ncan with sense-perception). He thought the way to determine what\nthings had positive value intrinsically was to consider what things\nwere such that, if they existed by themselves in isolation,\nwe would yet judge their existence to be good.\n\n\nAt Cambridge Moore was a colleague of Bertrand Russell\n(1872\u20131970) and Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889\u20131951). Russell\nwas not primarily a moral philosopher, but he expressed radically\ndifferent views at different times about ethics. In 1910 he agreed\nwith Moore that goodness (like roundness) is a quality that belongs to\nobjects independently of our opinions, and that when two people differ\nabout whether a thing is good, only one of them can be right. By 1922\nhe was holding an error theory (like that of John Mackie,\n1917\u201381) that although we mean by \u2018good\u2019 an\nobjective property in this way, there is in fact no such thing, and\nhence all our value judgments are strictly speaking false (\u201cThe\nElement of Ethics,\u201d Philosophical Essays). Then by 1935\nhe had dropped also the claim about meaning, holding that value\njudgments are expressions of desire or wish, and not assertions at\nall. Wittgenstein's views on ethics are enigmatic and subject to\nwildly different interpretations. In the Tractatus (which is\nabout logic) he says at the end, \u2018It is clear that ethics cannot\nbe put into words. Ethics is transcendental. (Ethics and aesthetics\nare one and the same.)\u2019 (Tractatus, 6.421). Perhaps he\nmeans that the world we occupy is good or bad (and happy or unhappy)\nas a whole, and not piece-by-piece. Wittgenstein (like Nietzsche) was\nstrongly influenced by Schopenhauer's notion of will, and by his\ndisdain for ethical theories that purport to be able to tell one what\nto do and what not to do. The Tractatus was taken up by the\nLogical Positivists, though Wittgenstein himself was never a Logical\nPositivist. The Logical Positivists held a\n\u2018verificationist\u2019 theory of meaning, that assertions can\nbe meaningful only if they can in principle be verified by sense\nexperience or if they are tautologies (for example, \u2018All\nbachelors are unmarried men.\u2019) This seems to leave ethical\nstatements (and statements about God) meaningless, and indeed that was\nthe deliberately provocative position taken by A.J. Ayer\n(1910\u201389). Ayer accepted Moore's arguments about the\nnaturalistic fallacy, and since Moore's talk of \u2018non-natural\nproperties\u2019 seemed to Ayer just nonsense, he was led to\nemphasize and analyze further the non-cognitive ingredient in\nevaluation which Moore had identified. Suppose I say to a cannibal,\n\u2018You acted wrongly in eating your prisoner.\u2019 Ayer thought\nI am not stating anything more than if I had simply said,\n\u2018You ate your prisoner.\u2019 I am, rather, evincing my moral\ndisapproval of it. It is as if I had said, \u2018You ate your\nprisoner\u2019 in a peculiar tone of horror, or written it with the\naddition of some special exclamation marks (Language, Truth and\nLogic, 107\u20138).\n\n\nThe emotivist theory of ethics had its most articulate treatment in\nEthics and Language by Charles Stevenson (1908\u201379). Stevenson\nwas a positivist, but also the heir of John Dewey (1859\u20131952) and the\nAmerican pragmatist tradition. Dewey had rejected the idea of fixed\nends for human beings, and stressed that moral deliberation occurs in\nthe context of competition within a person between different ends,\nnone of which can be assumed permanent. He criticized theories that\ntried to derive moral principles from self-certifying reason, or\nintuition, or cosmic forms, or divine commands, both because he\nthought there are no self-certifying faculties or self-evident norms,\nand because the alleged derivation disguises the actual function of\nthe principles as devices for social action. Stevenson applied this\nemphasis to the competition between people with different\nends, and stressed the role of moral language as a social instrument\nfor persuasion (Ethics and Language, Ch. 5). On his account,\nnormative judgments express attitudes and invite others to share these\nattitudes, but they are not strictly speaking true or false.\n\n\nWittgenstein did not publish any book after the Tractatus,\nbut he wrote and taught; and after his death Philosophical\nInvestigations was published in 1953. The later thought of\nWittgenstein bears a similar relation to the Tractatus as\nHeidegger bears to Husserl. In both cases the quest for a kind of\nscientific certainty was replaced by the recognition that science is\nitself just one language, and not in many cases prior by right. The\nlater Wittgenstein employed the notion of different \u2018forms of\nlife\u2019 in which different \u2018language games\u2019 including\nthose of religion are at home (Philosophical Investigation,\n\u00a77, 19, 373). In Oxford there was a parallel though distinct\ndevelopment centering round the work of John Austin\n(1911\u201360). Austin did not suppose that ordinary language was\ninfallible, but he did think that it preserved a great deal of wisdom\nthat had passed the test of centuries of experience, and that\ntraditional philosophical discussion had ignored this primary\nmaterial. In How to do Things with Words (published\nposthumously) Austin labeled \u2018the descriptive fallacy\u2019 the\nmistake of thinking that all language is used to perform the act of\ndescribing or reporting, and he attributed the discovery of this\nfallacy to Kant (How to do Things with Words, 3).\n\n\nR.M. Hare (1919\u20132002) took up the diagnosis of this fallacy, and\nproposed a \u2018universal prescriptivism\u2019 which attributed\nthree characteristics to the language of morality. First, it is\nprescriptive, which is to say that moral judgments express the will in\na way analogous to commands. This preserves the emotivist insight that\nmoral judgment is different from assertion, but does not deny the role\nof rationality in such judgment. Second, moral judgment is\nuniversalizable. This is similar to the formula of Kant's categorical\nimperative that requires that we be able to will the maxims of our\nactions as universal laws. Third, moral judgment is overriding. This\nmeans that moral prescriptions legitimately take precedence over any\nother normative prescriptions. In Moral Thinking (1981) Hare\nclaimed to demonstrate that utilitarianism followed from these three\nfeatures of morality, though he excluded ideals (in the sense of\npreferences for how the world should be independently of the agent's\nconcurrent desires or experience) from the scope of this argument. God\nenters in two ways into this picture. First, Hare proposed a figure he\ncalls \u2018the archangel\u2019 who is the model for fully critical\n(as opposed to intuitive) moral thinking, having full access to all\nthe relevant information and complete impartiality between the\naffected parties. Hare acknowledge that since archangels (e.g.,\nLucifer) are not reliably impartial in this way, it is really God who\nis the model. Second, we have to be able to believe (as Kant argued)\nthat the universe sustains morality in the sense that it is worthwhile\ntrying to be morally good. Hare thought that this requires something\nlike a belief (he called it a \u2018blik\u2019) in the operation of\nProvidence (\u201cThe Simple Believer,\u201d Essays on Religion\nand Education, appendix, 37\u20139).\n\n\nThe most important opponent of utilitarianism in the twentieth century\nwas John Rawls (1921\u20132005). In his Theory of Justice\n(1971) he gave, like Hare, an account of ethics heavily indebted to\nKant. But he insisted that utilitarianism does not capture the Kantian\ninsight that each person is an end in himself or herself, because it\n\u2018does not take seriously the distinction between persons\u2019\n(Theory of Justice, 22). He constructed the thought\nexperiment of the \u2018Original Position\u2019 in which individuals\nimagine themselves not knowing what role in society they are going to\nplay or what endowments of talent or material wealth they possess, and\nagree together on what principles of justice they will accept. Rawls\nthought it important that substantive conceptions of the good life\nwere left behind in moving to the Original Position, because he was\nattempting to provide an account of justice that people with competing\nvisions of the good could agree to in a pluralist society. Like early\nHabermas he included religions under this\nprohibition. In Political Liberalism (1993) he conceded that\nthe procedure of the Original Position is itself ideologically\nconstrained, and he moved to the idea of an overlapping consensus:\nKantians can accept the idea of justice as fairness (which the\nprocedure describes) because it realizes autonomy, utilitarians\nbecause it promotes overall utility, Christians because it is part of\ndivine law, etc. But even here Rawls wanted to insist that adherents\nof the competing visions of the good leave their particular\nconceptions behind in public discourse and justify the\npolicies they endorse on grounds that are publicly accessible. He\ndescribed this as the citizen's duty of civility (Political\nLiberalism, iv).\n\n\nThe section of this entry on the continental school discussed briefly\nthe topic of postmodernism. Within analytic philosophy the term is\nless prevalent. But both schools live in the same increasingly global\ncultural context. In this context we can reflect on the two main\ndisqualifiers of the project of relating morality intimately to\nreligion that seemed to emerge in the nineteenth and twentieth\ncenturies. The first disqualifier was the prestige of natural science,\nand the attempt to make it foundational for all human knowledge. The\nvarious empiricist, verificationist, and reductionist forms of\nfoundationalism have not yet succeeded, and even within modern\nphilosophy there has been a continuous resistance to them. This is not\nto say they will not succeed in the future (for example we may\ndiscover a foundation for ethics in the theory of evolution), but the\nconfidence in their future success has waned. Moreover, the\nsecularization hypothesis seems to have been false, as mentioned\nearlier. Certainly parts of Western Europe are less attached to\ntraditional institutional forms of religion. But taking the world as a\nwhole, religion seems to be increasing in influence rather than\ndeclining as the world's educational standards improve. The second\nmain disqualifier was the liberal idea (present in the narrative of\nthis entry from the time of the religious wars in Europe) that we need\na moral discourse based on reason and not religion in order to avoid\nthe hatred and bloodshed that religion seems to bring with it. Here\nthe response to Rawls has been telling. It seems false that we can\nrespect persons and at the same time tell them to leave their\nfundamental commitments behind in public discourse, and it seems false\nalso that some purely rational but still action-guiding component can\nbe separated off from these competing substantive conceptions of the\ngood (see Wolterstorff, \u201cAn Engagement with Rorty\u201d.) It is\ntrue that religious commitment can produce the deliberate targeting of\ncivilians in a skyscraper. But the history of the twentieth century\nsuggests that non-religious totalitarian regimes have at least as much\nblood on their hands. Perhaps the truth is, as Kant saw, that people\nunder the Evil Maxim will use any available ideology for their\npurposes. Progress towards civility is more likely if Muslims,\nChristians, Jews, (and Buddhists and Hindus) are encouraged to enter\n\u2018the public square\u2019 with their commitments\nexplicit, and see how much common ethical ground there in fact\nis. This writer has done some of this discussion, and found the common\nground surprisingly extensive, though sometime common language\ndisguises significant differences. Progress seems more likely in this\nway than by trying to construct a neutral philosophical ground that\nvery few people actually accept.\n\n\nOne recent development in analytic ethical theory has been a revival\nof divine command theory parallel to the revival of natural law theory\nthat I have already described. A pioneer in this revival was Philip\nQuinn's Divine Command and Moral Requirements (1978). He\ndefended the theory against the usual objections (one, deriving from\nPlato's Euthyprho, that it makes morality arbitrary, and the\nsecond, deriving from a misunderstanding of Kant, that it is\ninconsistent with human autonomy), and proposed that we understand the\nrelation between God and moral rightness causally, rather than\nanalyzing the terms of moral obligation as meaning\n\u2018commanded by God\u2019. Though we could stipulate such a\ndefinition, it would make it obscure how theists and non-theists could\nhave genuine moral discussion, as they certainly seem to do. Robert\nM. Adams, in a series of articles and then in Finite and Infinite\nGoods (1999), first separates off the good (which he analyzes\nPlatonically in terms of imitating the ultimate good, which is God)\nand the right. He then defends a divine command theory of the right by\narguing that obligation is always obligation to someone, and\nGod is the most appropriate person, given human limitations. John\nHare, In\nGod and Morality (2007) and Divine Command (2015),\ndefends a version of the theory that derives from God's sovereignty\nand defends the theory against the objection that obedience to divine\ncommand itself requires justification. He also compares Christian,\nJewish and Muslim accounts of divine command. Thomas L. Carson's\nValue and the Good Life (2000) argues that normative theory\nneeds to be based on an account of rationality, and then proposes that\na divine-preference account of rationality is superior to all the\navailable alternatives. An objection to divine command theory is\nmounted by Mark Murphy's An Essay on Divine Authority (2002)\nand God and Moral Law (2012) on the grounds that divine\ncommand only has authority over those persons that have submitted\nthemselves to divine authority, but moral obligation has authority\nmore broadly. William Wainwright's Religion and Morality\ndefends the claim that divine command theory provides a more\nconvincing account of moral obligation than any virtue-based theory,\nincluding Zagzebski's divine motivation theory, discussed\nearlier. Finally, C. Stephen Evans, in Kierkegaard's Ethics of\nLove: Divine Commands and Moral Obligations (2004) and\nGod and Moral Obligation(2013) articulates both in\nKierkegaard and in its own right a divine command theory that is\nargued to be superior to all the main alternative non-theist accounts\nof the nature and basis of moral obligation.\n\n\nTo conclude this entry, the revival of interest in divine command\ntheory, when combined with the revival of natural law theory I already\ndiscussed, shows evidence that the attempt to connect morality closely\nto religion is undergoing a robust recovery within professional\nphilosophy.\n",
