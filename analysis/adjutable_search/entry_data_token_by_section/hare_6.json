Levels of Moral Thinking\n\n\nA different feature of his theory, first presented (in different\nterminology) in \u201cEthical Theory and Utilitarianism\u201d\n(1976), and fully explored in Moral Thinking (1981), is a\ndistinction between a \u201ccritical\u201d level of thinking,\nconducted by \u201carchangels\u201d with the use of \u201cGolden\nRule\u201d arguments, and an \u201cintuitive\u201d level, conducted\nby \u201cproles\u201d with the use of simple principles (often\narticulating emotional responses) whose acceptance can be justified at\nthe critical level. These two levels define not two social castes, but\ntwo roles between which each of us learns to alternate as appropriate.\nThe complication is actually inevitable within consequentialism, which\nhas to separate the question how one should act from the\nquestion how one should think about how to act\u2014for ways\nof thinking have consequences no less than ways of acting (and\nthinking that one should act in a certain way entails no success in so\nacting, nor even any attempt). A utilitarian assessment of practical\nprinciples has to consider not only their observance utility\n(OU), which is what good will come of enacting them, but also\ntheir acceptance utility (AU), which is (roughly) what good\nwill come of intending to enact them. (Note that intending to act in a\ncertain way is itself a mental act. There is no ground here\nto shift to a different form of utilitarianism,\n\u201crule\u201d rather than \u201cact\u201d, or\n\u201cindirect\u201d rather than \u201cdirect\u201d; rather, so\nfar we are simply extending act-utilitarianism to a wider range of\nacts, mental as well as physical.) A broad generalization that Hare\nfavored is that the highest OU is likely to attach to highly specific\nprinciples, though a higher AU may attach to some fairly general ones.\nThis comes of human ignorance and self-deception. A principle, say,\npermitting adultery when a marriage is breaking up anyway might have a\nhigher OU than one simply forbidding adultery; but, if there are\npotential Don Juan\u2019s around with a talent for false rationalization,\nits AU may be lower.\n\n\nThis complication was both convenient, and problematic. Hare had long\nbeen wearied by familiar objections citing concrete cases where\nutilitarian theory appears to conflict with moral intuition, as when\nan American sheriff might judicially execute one suspect in order to\nprevent a mass lynching of others. He could now hope to accommodate\nthese at the \u201cintuitive\u201d level of thinking. An inability\never to countenance judicial murder may be recommendable by\ncritical to intuitive thinking as a constraint upon practical\nreflection in an emergency. And given that the attitude is approved,\nif not reasserted, by critical thinking as Hare conceives it, how can\nit in itself tell against his conception of critical thinking? (It\nwould be a case, so to speak, of biting the hand that fed one.)\n\n\nHowever, there is a difficulty. It is one thing to make do\nwith intuitive ways of solving problems that are the best available\nwithin limits of time and information, while leaving them subject to\ncorrection at leisure or in retrospect; it is another to accept a\ntheory that approves one\u2019s actually assenting to certain\nprinciples whose contents it cannot endorse. And yet a rule that is a\nmere \u201crule of thumb\u201d is a paper shield against temptation.\nAll is well if the theory can be self-effacing, so that the agent\ndiscards it as and when he adopts an intuitive viewpoint; but, in\nHare\u2019s scenario, in which the agent has internalized both critical and\nintuitive ways of thinking, how is he to keep out of mind, as he tests\nhis practical commitment to some intuitive principle, that it is\nsimply not of a kind (being absolute, and yet evidently equivalent to\nno principle of utility) to be critically endorsable?\n\n\nThis objection was to be raised both by Williams (1988) and by J.L.\nMackie (1985: 110\u201311) (cf. also, though not explicitly about\nHare, Hunt 1999: \u00a75). Hare anticipated it as follows:\nTo say that it is impossible to keep critical and intuitive\nthinking going in the same thought-process is like saying that in a\nbattle a commander cannot at the same time be thinking of the details\nof tactics, the overall aim of victory, and the principles (economy of\nforce, concentration of force, offensive action, etc.) which he has\nlearnt when learning his trade. (1981: 52; cf. 1988a:\n289\u201390)\nThis is evidently true of what he had called\n\u201crules of thumb\u201d, which an agent applies just so long as\nthis remains the best way in context of achieving his goals. However,\nHare came to deprecate that phrase (1981: 38), and to emphasize that\nthe \u201cprima facie principles\u201d he prefers to speak of have\nthe power to produce compunction even where their neglect,\nsince well grounded, cannot produce remorse (1981: 30). Yet\nhow is this to work? No doubt it is possible to combine being\nconvinced both that one has to do X in some difficult situation\n(say when only lying will save my father), and that doing X\nremains in some significant way bad. Yet this thought\nrequires the possession of a distinctive concept of being bad\nwhose application, on occasion, though lacking the power to determine\nan ethical decision, remains obstinately significant and\ninexpungible. Without such a concept, talk of\n\u201ccompunction\u201d is out of place. Hare makes room for this\nwhen he concedes that moral concepts may suffer a sea-change when they\nare applied at the intuitive and non-critical level. The only\nparticular proposal he makes is that \u201cought\u201d becomes\noverridable; yet he should surely be willing to concede that quite new\nconcepts may come into being\u2014all, of course, under the arching\nguidance of critical thinking. And one such concept might be expressed\nby a use of \u201cmorally bad\u201d of a kind associated with moral\nphilosophies that Hare would otherwise reject.\n\n\nHowever, it must remain a problem that, precisely to the extent that\nintuitive thinking can draw upon conceptions of its own, a clear-eyed\nintuitive thinking that does not occlude the judgments of critical\nthinking must be as problematic for Hare as a clear-eyed acrasia that\nunites conscious and voluntary infringement of a prescription with\ncontinued acceptance of it. Force still attaches to an objection by\nWilliams (1988: 190):\n\n\nThe theory ignores the fact that the responses are not merely a\nblack-box mechanism to generate what is probably the best outcome\nunder confusing conditions. Rather, they constitute a way of seeing\nthe situation; and you cannot combine seeing the situation in that\nway, from the point of view of those dispositions, with seeing it\nin the archangel\u2019s way, in which all that is important is maximum\npreference satisfaction, and the dispositions themselves are merely a\nmeans to that.\n",
