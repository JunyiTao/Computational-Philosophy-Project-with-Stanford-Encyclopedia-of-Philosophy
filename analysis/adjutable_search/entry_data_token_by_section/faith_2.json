    "main_text": "Faith as knowledge\n3. Faith as knowledge\n\nWhat kind of cognitive component belongs to faith, then? One\npossibility is that it is a kind of knowledge, but there is\nthen a question about the kind of knowledge that it is: e.g., is it\nknowledge \u2018by acquaintance\u2019, or\n\u2018propositional\u2019 knowledge \u2018by description\u2019, or\nboth? One type of model of faith as knowledge identifies faith as\npropositional knowledge of specific truths, revealed by God. A model\nof this type has received prominent recent defence in the work of\nAlvin Plantinga, who proposes an account which he regards as following\nin the tradition of the reformers, principally John Calvin (see\nPlantinga 2000, 168\u201386). Calvin defines faith thus: \u2018a\nfirm and certain knowledge of God\u2019s benevolence towards us,\nfounded upon the truth of the freely given promise in Christ, both\nrevealed to our minds and sealed upon our hearts through the Holy\nSpirit\u2019 (John Calvin, Institutes III, ii, 7, 551,\nquoted by Plantinga (2000, 244)).\n\nAppeal to a special cognitive faculty\n\n\u2018Reformed\u2019 epistemologists have appealed to an externalist\nepistemology in order to maintain that theistic belief may be\njustified even though its truth is no more than basically\nevident to the believer\u2014that is, its truth is not rationally\ninferable from other, more basic, beliefs, but is found to be\nimmediately evident in the believer\u2019s experience (see Plantinga\nand Wolterstorff 1983, Alston 1991, Plantinga 2000). On\nPlantinga\u2019s version, (basic) theistic beliefs count as knowledge\nbecause they are produced by the operation of a special cognitive\nfaculty whose functional design fits it for the purpose of generating\ntrue beliefs about God. Plantinga calls this the sensus\ndivinitatis, using a term of Calvin\u2019s. (For discussion of\nthe extent to which Plantinga\u2019s use of this term conforms to\nCalvin\u2019s own usage see Jeffreys 1997 and Helm 1998.) This\nquasi-perceptual faculty meets functional criteria as a mechanism\nthat, when functioning in the right conditions, confers\n\u2018warrant\u2019 (where warrant is whatever must be added to true\nbelief to yield knowledge) and, granted theism\u2019s truth, it\nprobably yields \u2018basic\u2019 knowledge because God designs it\njust for that purpose. In defence of specifically Christian belief,\nPlantinga argues that the same warrant-conferring status belongs to\nthe operation of the Holy Spirit in making the great truths of the\nGospel directly known to the believer.\n\nThe welcome certainty of faith\n\nThis appeal to a God-given \u2018higher\u2019 cognitive faculty is\nfound (in the early 12th Century) in al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s\nDeliverance from Error, where it provides the key to the\n\u2018Sufi\u2019 resolution of his religious crisis and his\nsceptical doubts about the deliverances of sense perception and\nunassisted human reason. Faith is thus understood as a kind of basic\nknowledge attended by a certainty that excludes doubt. But faith will\nnot be exclusively cognitive, if, as in Calvin\u2019s definition,\nfaith-knowledge is not only \u2018revealed to our minds\u2019 but\nalso \u2018sealed upon our hearts\u2019. For, on this model, faith\nwill also have an affective/evaluative component that includes a\nwelcoming of the knowledge received.\n\nPractical aspects of faith on this model\n\nThis model of faith as a kind of knowledge, certain and welcome,\nexhibits faith as essentially something to be received, something\ndelivered by the proper functioning of a special cognitive faculty.\nNevertheless, the model may admit a practical component, since an\nactive response is required for reception of the divine gift. Such a\npractical component is implied by the real possibility that faith may\nbe resisted: indeed, Christians may hold that in our sinful state we\nwill inevitably offer a resistance to faith that may be overcome only\nby God\u2019s grace. It is, however, a further step for persons of\nfaith to put their revealed knowledge into practice by trusting their\nlives to God and seeking to obey his will. On this \u2018special\nknowledge\u2019 model of faith, however, this activity counts as\n\u2018acting out\u2019 one\u2019s faith rather than as a part of\nfaith itself. Persons of faith thus act \u2018in\u2019,\n\u2018through\u2019 or \u2018by\u2019 faith: but, on this model,\ntheir faith itself is the welcomed revealed knowledge on which they\nact.\n",
