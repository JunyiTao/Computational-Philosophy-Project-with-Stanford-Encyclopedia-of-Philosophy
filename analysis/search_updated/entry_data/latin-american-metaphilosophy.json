    "main_text": "\n1. Preliminaries\n\nThe nature of philosophy in Latin America first drew the attention of\nphilosophically-minded thinkers in the early nineteenth century, when\nthe region began to develop into nations independent from Spain. But\nit acquired greater significance with the birth of contemporary\nacademic philosophy in the following century, ultimately taking center\nstage in Latin American philosophy during the second half of the\n20th century, where we still find it today. Often motivated\nby discomfort with mainstream conceptions of philosophy, inquiry into\nthe nature of Latin American philosophy has involved a number of\nsub-questions about its existence, originality, authenticity,\nsignificance, and role in culture and society. The search for answers\nhas led to reflection on what philosophy is (or should be),\nas a practice, and as an academic discipline. Thus many Latin American\nphilosophers have devoted their attention to the philosophy of Latin\nAmerican philosophy, and therefore, to metaphilosophy (understood as\nin Williamson 2007, p. ix). Somewhat paradoxically, many of those\nengaged in such metaphilosophical inquiry have shown skepticism about\nwhether there is a philosophy that can rightly be called \u2018Latin\nAmerican.\u2019 Others have recast an old, reductive conception of\nLatin American philosophy that ascribes to it a certain limited\nsocio-political role. But as discussed in what follows, there is also\na third group made up of philosophers whose views about the nature and\nquality of Latin American philosophy turns out to be neither skeptical\nnor reductionist in any of the ways to be considered here.\n1.1 Two Types of Philosophy\n\nAcademic philosophy, or autonomous philosophy as practiced in the\nWest since the Enlightenment, did not begin in Latin America\nuntil the first half of the twentieth century. Initially, the reigning\nphilosophical paradigm in the region was Scholasticism. That medieval\nstyle of philosophy prevailed during the colonial period, which\nextended roughly from the early sixteenth century to the early\nnineteenth century. Mainly confined to rehearsing the doctrines of\nclassical and medieval European philosophers, Latin American\nScholasticism was not to be challenged until the eighteenth century,\nwhen the theories of the Enlightenment and the rise of modern\nphilosophy began to be known in the American colonies of Spain and\nPortugal.\n\nParallel to these philosophical developments, a non-academic type of\nphilosophy consistently prospered in Latin America from the sixteenth\ncentury to the present. It comprises philosophical positions expressed\nin essay format, a hybrid genre cultivated by political and religious\nleaders, scientists, and literary figures among others. Interested in\nthe intersection of philosophy with literature, religion, and\npolitics, non-academic philosophical thinkers made significant\ncontributions to the intellectual history of Latin America. As may be\nexpected, however, the line separating academic and non-academic\nphilosophy is not always sharp. Although it\u2019s clear that a work\nsuch as the Labyrinth of Solitude, by the Mexican writer and\ndiplomat Octavio Paz \n (1914\u20131998)[1]\n falls within the latter, and L\u00f3gica viva (Living\nLogic), by Uruguayan philosopher Carlos Vaz Ferreira\n(1872\u20131958) falls within the former, there are many borderline\ncases. Consider Lascasianism: first developed by the Dominican friar\nand theologian Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas (Spanish-born,\n1474\u20131566) in colonial times, the doctrine is still influential\nin the work of Peruvian Gustavo Gutti\u00e9rrez and other\ncontemporary liberation theologians. It advocates a perfectionist\nversion of Roman Catholic ethics according to which the ways of life\nthat should be promoted are those that make people more\nhuman\u2014a thesis consistent with las Casas\u2019 1552\nvindication of the humanity of Amerindians (i.e., their\npersonhood). Since Lascasianism has philosophical grounds and\nimplications but is a product of amateur philosophers, it stands out\nas a prime borderline case between academic and non-academic\nphilosophy.\n1.2 Origins\n\nWhen did philosophy begin in Latin America? Any answer to this\nquestion would depend in part to whether one is asking about the\nbeginning of academic or non-academic philosophy. There is consensus\nthat some form of academic philosophy, mostly connected with teaching,\nexisted during the colonial period. An example of a successful work\nfrom this early period is L\u00f3gica mexicana, a textbook\nby the Mexican Antonio Rubio (1548\u20131615) widely used at the\ntime, even in Spain. But it was not until the early twentieth century\nthat philosophy acquired contemporary scholarly dimensions, including\nstandard institutional manifestations.\n\nAn interesting metaphilosophical issue related to the origin of Latin\nAmerican philosophy is whether the philosophical thought of\nPre-Colombian cultures also belongs in the non-academic tradition.\nNeedless to say, pre-Columbian thought unfolds in ways that seem\nutterly alien to our current standards about the form, content, or\nmethod method typical of philosophical work. But compliance with any\nsuch standards falls short of being a necessary condition for a work\nto count as philosophical. After all, the works of Pythagoras and the\nother Pre-Socratics are quite unorthodox in those respects yet\nconsidered philosophical. And contemporary examples too are not far to\nseek. Wittgenstein immediately comes to mind. A number of Latin\nAmerican philosophers are now prepared to agree with Peruvian\nFrancisco Mir\u00f3 Quesada that \u201c[i]n a broad sense,\nphilosophy has always existed in Latin America. The Maya and the Inca\nhad thought that, without abusing the terms, may be considered of\nphilosophical character\u2026.\u201d (1978, p. 75, my translation).\nTextual evidence of the existence of philosophical thought among the\nAztecs has been provided and analyzed by a number of experts. For\nexample, Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan (1499\u20131590), a Spanish\nfriar turned into amateur ethnologist, and contemporary philosophers\nsuch as Mexican Miguel Le\u00f3n Portilla (1963) and American James\nMaffie (2009, 2014).\n\nNuccetelli (2011) considers pre-Columbian works of philosophical\nimport to be part of Latin American proto-philosophy of the\nnon-academic variety. Gracia\u2019s (2008) understanding of Latin\nAmerican philosophy as ethnic philosophy (more on this later) can also\naccommodate pre-Columbian philosophical works within that discipline.\nBut Gracia (especially in his 2010) defers taking a position on\nwhether works such as the Maya folk-cosmology in the Popol\nVuh count as Latin American philosophy until proper historical\nwork can provide more stable and widely accepted answers about what\nfalls within that ethnic philosophy and what doesn\u2019t.\n2. What Is Latin American Philosophy?\n\nAs noted above, in contemporary Latin American philosophy lively\nmetaphilosophical debates, recognized as such by its participants, are\na frequent occurrence. The Peruvian Augusto Salazar Bondy\n(1925\u20131974) held that such debates belong to \u201cthe\nphilosophy of philosophy\u201d (1968, p. 13). He also divided the\nissues at stake into three categories, descriptive, prescriptive, or\nidentity issues (1968, p. 11), a classification that is for the most\npart still current. One exception is that, today, questions about\nwhether a philosophy is \u201coriginal, genuine, or peculiar\u201d\nare not strictly descriptive. For these predicates seem both\ndescriptive and evaluative, and therefore analogous to others now\nconsidered thick moral predicates, such as\n\u2018cruel,\u2019 \u2018loyal,\u2019 and the like.\n2.1 Some Main Descriptive Questions\n\nThe principal purely descriptive question in those debates concerns\nwhether philosophy exists as a practice or discipline in\nLatin America. When answered in the affirmative, a related question is\nwhen did it begin? There is consensus that the practice of philosophy\nsin m\u00e1s (as such\u2014i.e., for its own\nsake, autonomous of non-philosophical interests) is an early\ntwentieth-century phenomenon. But, understood in a broader sense, it\ndates from the colonial period. Thus, some take Latin American\nphilosophy to be a contemporary phenomenon (e.g., Mir\u00f3 Quesada\n1974, p. 75), while others trace it back to the sixteenth century\n(e.g., Gracia et al. 1995, p. 462; Hurtado 2007, p. 47). The\ndisagreement, however, is only apparent, since as noted by Francisco\nRomero one can acknowledge the colonial origins of (broad) philosophy\nwhile noting \u201cthe prevalence [then] of pedagogical over\nphilosophical concerns with regard to creativity and even the\nre-thinking of one\u2019s ideas and doctrines\u201d (1941, p. 12,\nsee also his 1943, p. 127).\n\nThe descriptive question about the existence of a Latin American\n(academic) philosophy can be sharpened by breaking it down into\nsmaller questions concerning the truth of each of the following\nclaims:\n\nPhilosophy exists in Latin America as a practice or discipline\nautonomous from the sciences, theology, literature, politics, and\neducation.\nThere are stable philosophical traditions and communities in the\nregion, of the sort commonly found in major centers of Western\nphilosophy.\nPhilosophy has acquired professional and institutional status\naccording to current Western standards (i.e., it is properly\nrepresented in educational systems, learned societies, associations,\njournals, presses, etc.).\n\n2.1.1 Philosophy\u2019s Autonomy and \u201cNormalcy\u201d\n\nSince the early twentieth century, there has been a strong endorsement\nof claim (I) (Alberini 1927; Romero 1943; Mir\u00f3 Quesada 1978;\nMoulines 2010). But critics are more cautious about previous periods,\npointing out that during the colonial period Latin American philosophy\nwas not autonomous from education. During the nineteenth century, as\nclearly evident in the work of Latin American positivists,\nphilosophical concerns had close connections to political and social\ninterests. In fact, up to about the 1910s, there was room for\nskepticism about all three claims. Between the 1910s and the 40s, a\ngeneration of philosophers known as the fundadores\n(\u2018Founders\u2019) strove to develop philosophy in Latin America\nas an autonomous discipline within academia, with the usual\nprofessional organizations and institutions. It was clearly owing to\ntheir efforts that philosophy became a practice in their universities\nanalogous to what their peers were doing at the time in major Western\ncenters of scholarship. For the first time since the Wars of\nIndependence and the national organization that followed (roughly,\nl810\u20131898), philosophy began to be studied for its own sake.\nMoreover, it became a professional activity with recognition in the\nwider community. Through all of these developments, the\nFounders\u2019 efforts bore fruit in establishing philosophical\n\u201cnormalcy\u201d (maturity). Philosophers of the next generation\nstrove to make the transformations stable. The Argentine Eduardo\nRabossi (1930\u20132005) observes that Latin American philosophy\ndeveloped relatively quickly compared to philosophy in Europe, since\nalthough Latin America followed European models, it was not until the\nnineteenth century that Europe itself acquired its own philosophical\n\u201cnormalcy\u201d (1994, p. 36).\n\nBe that as it may, by the 1940s not only (I) but also (III) above\nseemed true, as suggested by Rabossi\u2019s 1994 vivid narrative of\nthe vicissitudes faced by Alejandro Korn (1860\u20131936) and other\nArgentinean Founders in their effort to create a Facultad de\nFilosof\u00eda y Letras (College of Liberal Arts) at\nthe Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires.\n2.1.2 The New Skeptics\n\nGiven a current view that we may call \u2018new skepticism,\u2019\nhowever, claim (II) is false: Latin American philosophy still lacks\ninner and outer dialogue of the sort needed to develop stable\nphilosophical traditions and communities. Ezcurdia (2003),\nGarc\u00eda-Ram\u00edrez (2011), Hurtado (2006, 2007), Pereda\n(2006), and Rabossi (1994, 2008) are all new skeptics committed to\ndenying some version of (II) on the grounds that Latin American\nphilosophy faces what some of them refer to as an\n\u201cinvisibility\u201d problem. Latin American philosophy is\ninvisible because it has these problems\n\nInternal Dialogue Problem (IDP): There is no regular philosophical\ndialogue among Latin American philosophers, and\nExternal Dialogue Problem (EDP): There is no regular philosophical\ndialogue between Latin American philosophers and their Western\npeers.\n\n\nThe new skeptics mostly take the occurrence of an IDP for granted,\ndevoting little effort to providing reliable evidence for it. And when\navailable, the evidence is often difficult to test. A notable\nexception is Pereda 2006, which points out the lack of sufficient\nreference to Latin American publications in the numerous contributions\nby Latin Americans to the Enciclopedia iberoamericana de\nfilosof\u00eda (a multi-volume reference work whose first\nvolume appeared in 1987). Other adduced evidence is anecdotal,\ngenerally appealing to widespread occurrence of an IDP observed at\nconferences, learned societies, etc. Narratives to this effect\ncommonly describe Latin American philosophers as intellectuals who\nfail to engage in the study and discussion of their own traditions,\nwhich they perceive as uninteresting, of poor quality, or\ndisenfranchising. For example, adopting Enrique Dussel\u2019s 1998\ncenter/periphery distinction, Rabossi (2008, pp. 102ff.; see also his\n1994) tells us that the Latin American philosopher is a\n\u201cperiphery philosopher,\u201d with the self-image of a\n\u2018guacho\u2019 (slang for \u2018orphan,\u2019 or even\n\u2018street urchin\u2019). The guacho not only fails to\nacknowledge his own \u201cphilosophical parents,\u201d but\ndoesn\u2019t want to know about them at all: \u201che doesn\u2019t\ntake them into account, he doesn\u2019t read them, he is not even\ninterested in criticizing their defects or limitations; for him, his\nown philosophical past doesn\u2019t exist\u201d (2008, p. 103, my\ntranslation). Without awareness of his own philosophical past and\ndialog with regional peers, the Latin American philosopher can have\nneither philosophical traditions nor genuine philosophical\ncommunities. A related claim is made by Hurtado (2006, pp. 206ff.;\n2007. pp. 24ff.), for whom the IDP arises for Mexican philosophy, and\nby extension for Latin American philosophy, owing to the fact that\nmany of its practitioners have followed a \u201cmodernizing\nmodel.\u201d Among the numerous unwelcome traits of this model are\nthe tendencies of its followers to form small groups and spend most of\ntheir time trying to learn some imported philosophy, citing only\nforeign philosophers without paying much attention to regional peers.\nThose who adopt this model proceed to study the latest modern\ntradition, which uncritically replaces previous ones. At the end of\nthe day, in Latin American philosophy \u201c\u2026each modernizing\nmovement got lost for the upcoming movement\u2026\u201d (Hurtado\n2006, p. 206), and there are neither traditions nor stable communities\nof dialogue. \u201cBut the foreign philosophers,\u201d laments\nHurtado, \u201ceven those who visit our countries to deliver talks,\nvery rarely quote us in their work. There is therefore no genuine\ndialogue\u2026\u201d (Hurtado 2006, p. 205). For Hurtado, in\naddition to the IDP, Latin American philosophy faces the EDP. And of\nthe two problems, the IDP is the \u201ccentral\u201d one, thus the\nEDP appears to depend on the IDP (see also\nGarc\u00eda-Ram\u00edrez 2011, and compare Ezcurdia 2003). In any\nevent, on this view, Latin American philosophers will continue to face\nthe IDP \u201cunless we create a genuine critical dialogue among\nourselves and simultaneously exercise a constantly renewed memory of\npast dialogues\u201d (2006, p. 210). Until then, claim (II) is\nfalse.\n\nBut the new skeptics, confident that both problems, the IDP and EDP,\ncan be resolved invariably offer a list of suggestions about how to do\nthat. There is, however, considerable unacknowledged overlap in such\n\u201crepair manuals,\u201d which suggests that the new skeptics\nfail to establish among themselves an internal philosophical dialogue\nwhose very absence from Latin American philosophy they see as a\nproblem. If this ad hominem is strong, then the new skeptics\u2019\nchallenge to claim (II) is not without problems of its own. For the\nargument charges that new skepticism appears itself to suffer from the\nvery flaw it criticizes in Latin American philosophy: namely, the new\nskeptic omits not just establishing a dialogue with, but even\nacknowledging, the works by other Latin American philosophers on the\ntopic at issue. And although some new skeptics do make some such\nreferences (e.g., Garc\u00eda-Ram\u00edrez 2011), these are\nlimited to the work of those who are also new skeptics. But not all\nLatin American philosophers face the IDP, since as we shall see next\nthere is abundant textual evidence that the metaphilosophical\nquestions of concern here have generated intense dialogue and\ndiscernible skeptical and anti-skeptical traditions. For this reason,\nclaim (II)\u2014viz., that there are stable philosophical traditions\nand communities in the region, of the sort commonly found in major\ncenters of Western philosophy\u2014 has not yet been shown false.\n2.2 Some Main Normative Questions\n\nAnswers to the normative questions concerning whether there\nis, or could be, a Latin American philosophy that is original,\nauthentic, peculiar, or in some other ways distinctive constitute a\nwide philosophical spectrum, with what may be called \u2018strong\nuniversalism\u2019 at one extreme, \u2018strong distinctivism\u2019\nat the other, and \u2018middle-way theories\u2019 in between.\n2.2.1 Universalism vs. Distinctivism\n\nStrong universalism is the view that all philosophical theories,\nmethods, and topics have an import that is universal rather than\nrelative to regions, persons, groups, or cultures. It conflicts with\nstrong distinctivism, the view that all of philosophy\u2019s\ntheories, methods, and topics represent the point of view of a region,\nperson, group, or culture. The contemporary representatives of\nuniversalism in Latin American philosophy are many and have different\nphilosophical orientations (for an overview of classic universalism,\nsee Salazar Bondy 1968, pp. 45ff.). Universalism appears to be what\nArgentinean Pablo Navarro has in mind when he asserts \u201cLegal\nphilosophy in Latin America does not differ significantly from\nphilosophical studies of the law in the United States, Germany, the\nUK, or Sweden\u201d (2009, p.\n 439).[2]\n Gracia 2000 and Montemayor 2011 associate being a\nscientifically-minded philosopher with favoring universalism. Perhaps\nthe connection is grounded in some such philosophers\u2019 previous\ncommitment to the objectivity of science, together with their thesis\nthat science is the model for philosophy.\n\nFor a classic representative of universalism we need to look no\nfurther than the work of the Argentine Risieri Frondizi\n(1910\u20131983), who by combining universalism with originalism was\nled to the skeptical conclusion that, in the late 1940s, only a very\nsmall part of philosophy in Latin America deserved to be considered\nphilosophy at all. But as pointed out earlier by his compatriot\nJos\u00e9 Ingenieros (1887\u20131925), not everything needs to be\n(indeed we might say, \u2018can be\u2019) original in the work of\n\u201ca true philosopher\u201d (Ingenieros 1914, p. 7). Furthermore,\nnot only is originality a matter of degree but the term\n\u2018original\u2019 is itself ambiguous. It has been used with\nconnotations such as\n\nBeing creative, novel, and autochthonous (Ingenieros 1914).\nBeing creative and non-imitative (Cannabrava 1949; Frondizi\n1949).\nBeing a philosophical product that \u201cmakes some degree of\ncontribution to ideas or approaches, with respect to previous works,\nand is sufficiently discernible as a creation and not a repetition in\ncontent. In this sense, an original philosophy is identified by its\nnew conceptual constructions of recognized value\u201d (Salazar\nBondy168, p. 100, my translation).\nBeing tradition-originating (Hurtado 2007).\n\n\nPutting aside Hurtado\u2019s more idiosyncratic understanding of the\nterm and Ingenieros\u2019s too permissive understanding as a\nsynonymous of \u2018autochthonous,\u2019 we have:\n\nA philosophical work is original just in case it makes some degree of\ncontribution to philosophy by being creative, non-imitative, or novel\nwith respect to previous works.\n\n2.2.2 The Originality Problem\n\nWe\u2019ll now consider two positions, Frondizi 1949 and Pereda 2000,\neach committed to holding that Latin American academic philosophy\nfails to be sufficiently original in the above sense. Frondizi\u2019s\ncommitment to this thesis is explicit: he concludes that based on the\nevidence, only 10% of philosophy \u2018as such\u2019 in Latin\nAmerica is original. Since the works of non-academic philosophers are\nexcluded from this evidence, as a result Latin American philosophy is\ndevoid of significant history, theories, methods, and number of\ncreative practitioners. Nuccetelli 2003 responds to this skeptical\nview by arguing that by contrast with academic philosophers in Latin\nAmerica, the non-academic philosophers have offered the more original\nphilosophical positions. Furthermore, in other parts of the world\ncontributions by non-academics who did not practice philosophy for its\nown sake are often counted as philosophy, as exemplified by works of\nHume, Bentham, Mill, Saint Simon, Marx and many others. If this is\ncorrect, then Frondizi\u2019s criterion turns out to be too\ndemanding. In addition, Gracia (2003) notes that in no other\nethnic philosophy (more on this later) is originality\nconsidered a necessary condition for having philosophy\n\nPereda\u2019s recent work also shows he thinks that there is an\noriginality problem facing Latin American philosophy, an skeptical\nview presupposed by his claim that philosophy in the region is\n\u201cinvisible\u201d (i.e., suffers from the IDP and EDP mentioned\nabove). Like Frondizi, Pereda first praises the work of Latin American\nessayists, and even takes it to be a model that philosophy must\nemulate in order to overcome its invisibility problems. But to be a\nmodel that needs emulation is one thing, to count as Latin American\nphilosophy quite another. Since Pereda also locates non-academic\nphilosophy somewhere else, as a result, he runs head-on into a\nconclusion similar to Frondizi\u2019s skepticism about the features\nof Latin American philosophy. Such skepticism is inevitable because on\nPereda\u2019s view, Latin American philosophy suffers from the\n\u201carrogant reasoning\u201d of its practitioners, which fuels the\nepistemic vices of \u201cnationalist enthusiasm\u201d (in the case\nof distinctivists) or \u201csubaltern fervor\u201d and\n\u201ccraving for novelty\u201d (in the case of universalists). Such\nvices, and ultimately arrogant reasoning itself, are to be blamed for\nthe internal and external invisibility of Latin American\nphilosophy.\n\nIt can now be shown that these alleged vices of universalists, if\nsubstantiated, would raise an originality challenge to Latin America\nphilosophy. After all, universalism has many representatives of a\ngreat variety of persuasions (Gracia and Jaksi\u0107 1986, p. 214;\nMir\u00f3 Quesada 1978, p. 76; Salazar Bondy 1968, pp. 49ff.). If\nuniversalists are driven by subaltern fervor and a craving for\nnovelty, then they need perforce to devote considerable time\nand effort to assimilating the latest fads (something they have done,\naccording to Hurtado\u2019s 2006 critique of the modernizing model).\nSince producing work that is to a significant degree original requires\nconsiderable time and effort, there would be empirical constraints on\nthose philosophers\u2019 capability to produce original work.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the invisibility problem is closely connected\nwith the originality problem. But although all new skeptics think\nthere is an invisibility problem for Latin American philosophy, they\ndisagree about what to make of the originality problem. For new\nskeptic Maite Ezcurdia (2003), it does arise. On her view, of four\nkinds of originality she identifies as desirable in philosophy (viz.,\ninterpretative, argumentative, problem-making, and problem-solving),\nLatin American philosophy comes out as having interpretative\noriginality, yet lacking originality of the other three kinds. In\nparticular, Ezcurdia contends that an improvement in problem-solving\noriginality is needed for fixing the EDP, which would in turn lead to\na solution to the IDP. On the other hand, Eduardo\nGarc\u00eda-Ram\u00edrez (2011, p. 13) dismisses the originality\nproblem but writes: \u201ceven though there is enough originality,\nmost Latin American philosophy is haunted by the two proceedings of\narrogant reasoning: internal visibility is a function of the external\npartly because Latin American philosophy is not used to thinking on\nits own.\u201d Questions arise, however, as to how could there be\nenough originality in a philosophy that\u2019s not used to thinking\non its own?\n2.2.3 The Authenticity Problem\n\nAccording to distinctivists, a chief distinguishing characteristic of\nLatin American philosophy is\u2014or should be\u2014authenticity, a\nfeature of any \u201cphilosophical product that, like any other\ncultural product has integrity and is devoid of falsity or pretense.\nIn this sense, we say, for example, that Kant\u2019s philosophy is\nauthentic, but spiritism is pseudo-philosophy\u201d (Salazar Bondy\n1968, pp. 100\u2013101, my translation). Salazar (1968, p. 101) and\n(Hurtado 2006, p. 209) distinguish authenticity from\npeculiarity, the regional coloring of a philosophical product\nthat is characteristically Latin American. A philosophical work may be\npeculiar by virtue of discussing a Latin American theme or by virtue\nof being the product of a Latin American author, even when it could\nlack authenticity, originality, or both. At the same time, it could be\noriginal and/or authentic without being peculiar. Since a full account\nof such conceptual inter-relations goes beyond our present purpose,\nlet\u2019s stipulate that a Latin American philosophy is\n\nOriginal just in case it is creative, non-imitative, or\nnovel;\nAuthentic just in case it is genuine or non-spurious;\nand\nPeculiar just in case it is characteristically Latin\nAmerican.\n\n\nAs pointed out by Salazar, feature (3) is the cheapest of all: it can\neasily be obtained by a work whose topic, or even author, is\nrelevantly related to Latin America. Although, as we\u2019ll soon\nsee, peculiarity may be what some distinctivists actually have in\nmind, more often they care most about authenticity\u2014holding that\noriginality will come \u2018for a\u00f1adidura\u2019 (as an\naddition).\n\nAn early proposal to develop a peculiar Latin American philosophy is\nthat of the Argentine Juan Bautista Alberdi (1810\u20131884) in his\n\u201cIdeas\u2026.\u201d This short newspaper article, published\nin Montevideo in 1840, offers advice about how to develop a high\nschool course in philosophy to be taught at the Colegio de Humanidades\n(School of Humanities). It recommends that the course be aimed at\n\u201cinstruct[ing] the youth in the principles that reside in the\nconscience of our societies\u201d (1840, p. 97, my translation). On\nthis view, Latin American philosophy should be devoted, not to\nabstract metaphysics, but rather to applied philosophy, focusing on\nthe social and political issues of the day in the newly independent\nnations of the region. But Alberdi\u2019s article also ventures into\nmetaphilosophical issues that were far beyond politics and diplomacy,\nhis areas of expertise\u2014notoriously opining, among other things,\nthat it was for Europe, not Latin America, to do the theoretical\nphilosophical thinking (1840, p. 95). Not to be reprinted until the\nfollowing century, this article is unlikely to have had the influence\nascribed to it by some distinctivists of the 1940s and their\nfollowers. The point is made forcefully by the Uruguayan Arturo Ardao\n(1912\u20132003), a well-known historian of Latin American philosophy\nwho contends that the article \u201ccame to have influence in Latin\nAmerica in the context of the philosophical innovations of the 1940s,\nprecisely a year after its centennial. Its most decisive apologist\nturned out to be the magisterial philosopher Gaos in Mexico \u201d\n(1991, p. xxiii, my translation). Arturo Roig also regards the\ntwentieth-century fascination with Alberdi\u2019s \u201cIdeas\u201d\nas an ideological coincidence. He writes:\n\nGaos\u2019s opinions and theses conferred on Alberdi\u2019s text a\nsignificance more vast [than its actual one], which goes beyond the\ntopic of a \u2018national philosophy\u2019 that was the framework\nwithin which the text was evaluated in Argentina. It also ascribed to\nit a scope unimagined by Alberdi. It appears, rather, that Alberdian\nhistoricist circumstantialism ended up coinciding with Mexican\ncircumstantialism\u2026 (Roig 1981b, p. 1, my translation)\n\n\nFor a more contemporary vindication of features of Latin American\nphilosophy akin to peculiarity, we\u2019ll need to turn to some of\nthe middle-way theories below. But first, let\u2019s consider the two\nmain strands of extreme distinctivism in Latin American philosophy,\nthe \u2018the critical theory\u2019 and\n\u2018circumstantialism\u2019 (also known as \u2018critical\nview,\u2019 and \u2018culturalism\u2019 respectively; see e.g.,\nGracia and Jaksi\u0107 1986).\n\nThe critical theory is a hybrid that includes theses from early\ntwentieth century Marxists as well as the views of contemporary\n\u2018liberation philosophers,\u2019 who in turn combine Marxist\nideas with European doctrines from French structuralism, the Frankfurt\nSchool, and other sources. Abundant textual evidence suggests that,\nfor the critical theorist, Latin America philosophy commonly lacks\noriginality, authenticity, and/or peculiarity. Thus, an early\nrepresentative of the view laments that:\n\nAll the thinkers of our America have been educated in European\nschools. The spirit of the race is not felt in their work. The\ncontinent\u2019s intellectual production lacks its distinguishing\ntraits. It does not have an original profile. Hispanic-American\nthought is generally only a rhapsody composed from the motifs and\nelements of European thought. To prove this, one needs only review the\nwork of the highest representatives of the Indo-Iberian intellect.\n(Mari\u00e1tegui 1925, p. 113, my translation)\n\n\nSimilarly, a critical theorist of the 1940s regards Brazilian (and, by\nextension, Latin American) philosophy as lacking originality,\nauthenticity and peculiarity by virtue of its creators\u2019\n\u201ccolonial mentality,\u201d a situation that would persist until\nLatin America has won \u201ccomplete independence\u2014economic, and\ncultural\u2014from the imperialistic powers\u201d (Coutinho 1943,\npp. 187\u2013188). Analogous arguments were offered later by Salazar,\nfor whom Latin American philosophy had been, from its colonial\nbeginnings, only \u201ca thought of the upper class or of a refined\noligarchical elite, when it has not corresponded openly to waves of\nforeign economic and political influence. In all these cases\nunderdevelopment and domination are influential\u201d (1969, p. 241).\nEndorsing this line of reasoning, Roig declares that the work of\nFounders such as the Peruvian Alejandro Deustua (1849\u20131945) is\n\u201ca prime example of the uprooting and the alienation in Latin\nAmerican thought denounced so vehemently by Augusto Salazar\nBondy\u201d (1976, p. 251).\n\nBut it seems reductionist at best to hold that cultural dependence and\neconomic underdevelopment always determine a philosophy\u2019s\nshortcomings in the features relevant here. A prime counterexample is\nthe ethics of las Casas mentioned above, which is original, authentic,\nand peculiar, though developed under extreme cultural and economic\ndependence (for more on this, see Nuccetelli 2013). Furthermore, the\ncritical theory also faces the following ad hominem objections:\n\nSince the critical theorist usually belongs to the upper class in\nLatin American societies, which on her own view are incapable of\nproducing a philosophy with features (1)\u2013(3), the critical\ntheory itself lacks (1)\u2013(3) and should be rejected.\nThe critical theorist usually borrows from European traditions\nsuch as Marxism, existentialism, structuralism, and the Frankfurt\nSchool. But borrowed traditions are, on her own view, incapable of\ngenerating an authentic Latin American philosophy. It follows that the\ncritical theory is not authentic and should be rejected.\n\n\nObjections along these lines (e.g., Gracia 2003 and Hurtado 2007),\ntogether with its vulnerability to counterexamples, make the critical\ntheory implausible.\n\nThere is, however, another distinctivist theory that might be\nplausible: circumstantialism. Famously expounded by the Mexican\nLeopoldo Zea (1912\u20132004), its main concern is authenticity.\nPutting aside its contention that an authentic philosophy is bound to\nacquire originality and peculiarity at some point, here is\ncircumstantialism\u2019s main argument:\n\nAll philosophical works are authentic in that they invariably show\nthe cultural circumstance of their production.\nTherefore, all Latin American philosophical works show\nthe cultural circumstance of their production.\nTherefore, all Latin American philosophical works are\nauthentic.\n\n\nConsistent with this argument, the circumstantialist maintains,\n\nThe abstract issues [of philosophy] will have to be seen from the\nLatin American man\u2019s own circumstance. Each man will see in such\nissues what is closest to his own circumstance. He will look at these\nissues from the standpoint of his own interests, and those interests\nwill be determined by his way of life, his abilities and inabilities,\nin a word, by his own circumstance. In the case of Latin America, his\ncontribution to the philosophy of such issues will be permeated by the\nLatin American circumstance. Hence, when we [Latin Americans] address\nabstract issues, we shall formulate them as issues of our own. Even\nthough being, God, etc., are issues appropriate for every man, the\nsolution to them will be given from a Latin American standpoint. (Zea\n1948, p. 226)\n\n\nIn this way, the circumstantialist appears to have dissolved the\nalleged conflict between universalism and distinctivism. For, given\nthe above argument, the following claims are all compatible:\n\nThere is an authentic Latin American philosophy.\nThe problems and methods of philosophy are universal.\nPhilosophers\u2019 \u2018circumstances\u2019 always shape their\ntheories and methods.\n\n\nBut the soundness of the cirumstantialist argument hinges on its\npremise 1. This is a very strong claim which entails not only that (a)\nthe context of discovery (or creation) is to some degree apparent in\nany philosophical theory, so that all theories are peculiar in the\nabove sense, but also that (b) such context renders them authentic.\nYet (a) is at the very least controversial, given that it is not\nobvious what is Greek about Aristotle\u2019s theory of the syllogism\nor German about Kant\u2019s categorical imperative (see Nuccetelli\n2003, but compare Monahan 2005). Moreover, (a) may entail peculiarity,\nnot authenticity. For the latter, the circumstantialist needs (b), a\nclaim for which no sound argument is in the offing. In addition, as\nargued in Gracia 2003, there is an irresolvable problem for anyone\nattempting to specify what\u2019s necessary and sufficient for being\na Latin American cultural circumstance, as opposed to the\ncircumstances of other cultures. And no less difficult would be the\ntask of tracing the connections between philosophical theories and\nculture in Latin America, given the bewildering diversity of cultures\nthat have flourished there.\n2.2.4 Reductionism about Latin American Philosophy\n\nA number of recent contributors to the debate about the nature of\nLatin American philosophy have contended that philosophical inquiry in\nthe discipline should focus on some historical, social, and/or\neconomic issues relevant to Latin Americans and their descendants in\nthe USA. For instance, according to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Orosco (2016)\nMexican American philosophy and Latin American philosophy as practice\nin the United States should focus on developing the perspective of the\nMexican people and the Latin American people respectively. On his\nview, the success of these disciplines hinges on their ability to deal\nwith \u201cquestions about [Mexican or Latino] identity, power, and\ncitizenship in the United States,\u201d which may have an impact on\n\u201cU.S. American political and social life\u201d (Orosco 2016:\n27). Since such issues belong to applied ethics and political\nphilosophy, his recommendation has direct reductionist connotations\nassuming that he thinks that they are the only issues that\nmatter, or should matter, to practitioners of Mexican/Latin American\nphilosophy in the USA. But perhaps that connotation is not what Orosco\nhas in mind since that would defeat his own inquiry into the nature of\nMexican American and Latin American philosophy, both issues of\nmetaphilosophy. Silva Grant\u2019s 2015 proposal is analogously\nreductionist. Elizabeth Mill\u00e1n Brusslan (2015) has objected to\nit on the grounds that it is too exclusionary. After all, many\nphilosophical works that are content-related to Latin American\nphilosophy but do not engage in such social, historical, and/or\neconomic issues would be left out of Latin American philosophy. For\nGrant, the sole task of this field is conducting inquiry into the\nstruggle of Latin Americans against colonialism. Nuccetelli (2018)\nrejects any such proposal as a kind of thorough-going relativism\nbecause different theorists would disagree about the issues that need\nbe the focus of Latin American philosophy. In addition, she argues\nthat such metaphilosophical reductionism has bad practical\nconsequences because it may contribute to an existing bias against\nLatin American philosophers in the USA according to which they\ncommonly make either false or unsupported empirical claims about\nissues that belong to other humanities or the social sciences. Susanna\nSiegel (2014) recommends against contributing to this bias while\nsuggesting that philosophical questions are distinct from questions of\nother humanities or the social sciences. On different grounds, many\npractitioners of Latin American philosophers have noted the existence\nof such a widespread bias (e.g., Covarrubias 2015, Gracia 2000,\nMendieta 1999, S\u00e1nchez 2011, and Vargas 2007, 2010).\n2.3 Middle-Way Theories\n\nMiddle-way theories reject both strong universalism and strong\ndistinctivism. If successful, they would avoid the problems facing\neach of those extremes\u2014which, as we saw above, are skepticism\nabout Latin American philosophy (in strong universalism) and\nungrounded assumptions (in strong distinctivism). Here we\u2019ll\nbriefly consider three recent middle-way positions. The first two\nagree that it would be possible to provide examples of sufficient\nconditions for a work to count as Latin American philosophy. The\nposition discussed last undertakes the more ambitious project of\nproposing a set of conditions that are necessary and jointly\nsufficient.\n\n2.3.1 Gracia\u2019s Ethnic-Philosophy Account\n\nWhat we may call \u2018the ethnic-philosophy account\u2019\n(Gracia\u2019s 2003, 2008) is a neo-Wittgensteinian view holding that\nLatin American philosophy (and more broadly, Hispanic and Latino/a\nphilosophy) is\n\n[T]he philosophy of an ethnos, and insofar as it is so, and members of\nethne do not necessarily share features in common, then what the\nphilosophy of a particular ethnos is exactly will not require any\nfeatures in common with other philosophies outside the ethnos or even\nwithin the ethnos throughout its history. This, I claim, is the best\nway of understanding the unity of Latin American philosophy. (Gracia\n2008, p. 140)\n\n\nOn this account, being the philosophy of the Latin American ethnos is\nsufficient for counting as Latin American philosophy. At the same\ntime, the account holds that it is not possible to provide conditions\nthat are necessary and jointly sufficient for being an\ninstance of this ethnic philosophy. No such conditions are to be had,\neven in the case of \u2018Spanish philosophy,\u2019 another ethnic\nphilosophy for which no necessary and sufficient conditions of\ninclusion can be offered, even though it appears identifiable in\nnationality terms\u2014a conclusion suggested by the fact that\n\u2018Spanish philosophy\u2019 commonly includes figures such as\n\u201cSeneca and Averroes, philosophers who lived long before the\nSpanish nation was constituted as a political reality, and whose\nrelationship to this nation, as we have known it since the sixteenth\ncentury, is less than tenuous\u201d (Gracia 2003, p. 57).\n\nThis conception of Latin American philosophy as an ethnic philosophy\nis inspired by Wittgenstein\u2019s \u2018family resemblances\u2019\ntheory for concepts such as \u2018game\u2019 and\n\u2018funny.\u2019 For example, there is no distinguishing feature\nthat all games have in common in virtue of which they are games.\nRather, there are resemblances between activities we call\n\u2018games\u2019 that are like the resemblances between members of\na single family. Similarly, there are no distinguishing properties of\nan ethnic philosophy but numerous properties that would each be a\nsufficient condition for belonging to it. This seems to entail that\nthat an ethnic philosophy can be categorized in a variety of ways,\ngiven that its identity hinges at least in part on the adopted\n\u201cselective point of view\u201d with regard to its properties.\nSome cases illustrating the claim come readily to mind. Consider\nPicasso\u2019s works. They may be legitimately categorized as French\nunder one selective point of view, and as Spanish under another. Thus,\nwhether they fall under one or the other is at least in part\ncontingent upon a selective point of view (Gracia 2003, p. 65).\nLikewise, it is possible that certain philosophical works belong to\nLatin American philosophy under one selective point of view, but not\nunder another. Thus, whether Latin American philosophy turns out to be\nthin or robust would then itself be contingent, at least in part, upon\nwhich selective point of view one were to adopt. In short,\nsince the concept \u2018Latin American philosophy\u2019 is\nrelevantly analogous to concepts such as \u2018game\u2019 or\n\u2018funny,\u2019 there are no necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor individuating Latin American philosophy; but a variety of\nselective criteria are possible. Each such criterion would be\nlegitimate, provided that it captured a contextually determined,\nsufficient condition for being an instance of Latin American\nphilosophy. Here is how the ethnic-philosophy theorist spells out his\nview on this matter\n\nIn a context in which all texts are in English and have American\nauthors except for one, who is Uruguayan, the origin of the author\ncould be sufficient to identify the text as belonging to Latin\nAmerican philosophy. In a situation in which we have a series of Latin\ntexts published in Spain, but one of which was written by an author\nwho spent the greatest part of his life in Mexico, we could identify\nthis text as Latin American. (Gracia 2003, p. 64)\n\n\nOne of the advantages of this account is its flexibility. For it\nentails that Latin American philosophy can accommodate whatever works\nmeet an appropriate contextually determined condition, whether they be\nnonstandard works such as those of las Casas and Gutti\u00e9rrez, or\nmainstream ones such as those of Newton da Costa or C. Ulises Moulines\n(more on this below). The account is also capable of accommodating the\nfact that some works seem characteristically Latin American while\nothers have a universal import. Furthermore, it allows one to\nclassify, e.g., Kant\u2019s categorical imperative as German\nphilosophy in a context where an author\u2019s place of origin is\nrelevant, and as universal deontology in a context where birthplace is\nnot relevant.\n\nThe main challenge for this view is how to avoid an anything-goes form\nof metaphilosophical relativism. Gracia (2003, p. 66) has sought to\neliminate this threat by emphasizing that it is not only a\ncontextually determined, selective point of view that matters for\nindividuating ethnic philosophies. Reality also has a role, possibly\nin connection with history, which Gracia invokes to explain the nature\nof \u201cphilosophical texts.\u201d On his view, these are\n\u201chistorical entities, the product of historical beings in\nparticular times and places whose identities are linked to the context\nin which they were produced and which, for that reason, depend on\nthem\u201d (2003, p. 65). Metaphilosophical relativists can, however,\nwelcome this appeal to history, though they would further insist that\nit is not only philosophical texts but also the truth of philosophical\ntheories that\u2019s similarly contingent upon historical context. In\nfact, more than a mere logical possibility, relativism of this sort is\nby now a strong twentieth century tradition in the philosophy of\nscience (see, e.g., Kuhn 1962, especially chapter 10).\n\n2.3.2 Moulines\u2019s Compromise Account\n\nAlso a middle way between universalism and distinctivism is\nMoulines\u2019s 2010 position. Like Gracia\u2019s account, it\nvindicates only sufficient conditions for being an instance of Latin\nAmerican philosophy. But unlike Gracia\u2019s account,\nMoulines\u2019s does not argue against the possibility of conditions\nthat are both necessary and jointly sufficient. His positive proposal\nconsists of four sufficient conditions that, on his view, a number of\nrecent works meet\u2014namely, they are universal in the sense that\nthey use concepts and provide arguments that are intended to be\nuniversally valid; (2) they have been developed by Latin American\nauthors; (3) they have been originally devised, at least partially, in\nsome Latin American countries; and (4) they have found widespread\ninterest both in and outside Latin America.\n\nSatisfying (1) through (4) is considered sufficient for a work to be\n\u201can instantiation of \u2018Latin American\nphilosophy\u2019\u201d (Moulines 2010, p. 460). Moulines\u2019s\nsample of such instances includes several brands of theories and/or\nmethods developed by contemporary Latin American philosophers such as\nparaconsistent logic (by Brazilian Newton da Costa and his\ncollaborators), formal deontic logic (by Argentinean Carlos\nAlchourr\u00f3n and Eugenio Bulygin), belief revision (in part by\nAlchourr\u00f3n), scientific realism (by Argentinean Mario Bunge), a\nhistorical approach to the foundations of physics (by Chilean Roberto\nTorreti), and structuralist theory of science (by Venezuelan Moulines\nand his collaborators).\n\nAccording to Moulines, conditions (1) through (4) express an\nunderstanding of Latin American philosophy that is\n\u201c\u2018universalist\u2019 as much as\n\u2018distinctivist\u2019\u201d (2010, p. 460). A quick look at\nthem suggests that (1) is relevant to universalism, (2) and (3) to\ndistinctivism, and (4) to neither because it is neutral, though it\nbears on the external invisibility problem mentioned above. But note\nthat(2) and (3) are distinctivist only in terms of\n\u2018peculiarity\u2019\u2014which, as pointed out earlier, is the\ncheapest of the distinctive properties at issue on this debate.\n\n2.3.3 Nuccetelli\u2019s Applied-Philosophy Account\n\nAnother mid-way position to be considered here was developed in\nNuccetelli 2002 and 2009. It proposes a set of conditions that are\ntaken to be both necessary and jointly sufficient for being an\ninstance of a characteristically Latin American\nphilosophy\u2014namely, that any qualifying work must\n\nContain philosophical arguments or methods that are sufficiently\noriginal, and\nBe sensitive to a Latin America context.\n\n\nAny work satisfying (1) and (2) would count as characteristically\nLatin American in Nuccetelli\u2019s sense. She further contends that\nthere is a robust body of philosophical work in Latin America that\nsatisfies these conditions. It is mostly devoted to issues of moral,\nsocial, and political philosophy and includes the works of both,\nnon-academic and academic philosophers. Thus construed, Latin American\nphilosophy comes out as a branch of applied philosophy and its\nexistence is consistent with that of universal philosophy\u2014which\nis grounded in a variety of traditions of Western philosophy and\ndevoted to problems that have universal import such as knowledge and\nskepticism, the nature of consciousness, moral reasoning, and the\nexistence and attributes of God. A Latin American philosopher may\ncultivate either universal philosophy or some branch of applied\nphilosophy, including Latin American philosophy. From the time of the\nFounders to the present, there has been a long list of those who in\nfact did both.\n3. The Issue of the Name\n\nA final note on the issue of the name: Latin American philosophers\nhave expressed a number of different preferences about what to call\nthe field. The standard name preferred here has been \u2018Latin\nAmerican philosophy.\u2019 But there are other options, depending on\nwhether \u2018thought\u2019 takes the place of\n\u2018philosophy,\u2019 and/or \u2018Iberoamerican,\u2019\n\u2018Hispanic,\u2019 \u2018Hispanic-American\u2019 or\n\u2018Latino/a\u2019 (among other qualifiers) takes the place of\n\u2018Latin American.\u2019 Keeping in mind that not all\nreplacements would be semantically equivalent (a topic revisited\nlater), note that the rationale for using \u2018thought\u2019 in\nlieu of \u2018philosophy\u2019 is to do justice to the breadth of\nphilosophical developments in Latin America\u2014which, as\nwe\u2019ve seen, includes a vast corpus of non-standard, non-academic\nphilosophical works. There is no common rationale for substituting any\nof the above qualifiers for \u2018Latin American.\u2019 But each\nproposed qualifier (including \u2018Latin American\u2019) inherits a\nproblem faced by the proper name from which it derives. The problem\nmay be semantic or pragmatic, where\n\nA semantic problem arises for the use of a term in the\nabsence of satisfactory criteria for determining its meaning or\nreference, and\nA pragmatic problem arises for the use of a term in the\npresence of morally, politically, or socially unacceptable\nconnotations associated with that term.\n\n\nAs an illustration, let\u2019s consider the term preferred here,\n\u2018Latin American philosophy.\u2019 Its qualifier derives from\n\u2018Latin America,\u2019 which appears to suffer from both types\nof problem. With few exceptions (e.g., Oliver 1998), those who have\nrecently reflected on this term go beyond geography and politics to\nconsider also factors such as culture and history in order to\ndetermine this term\u2019s meaning and reference. But it has proved\ndifficult to find criteria that avoid semantic problems such as\n\nThe term is too broad since \u2018Latin America,\u2019 when used\nliterally and directly, refers to certain people and territories which\nare not ordinarily taken to be Latin American (e.g., the\nQuebecois).\nThe term is too narrow since \u2018Latin America,\u2019 when\nused literally and directly, does not refer to peoples and\nterritories that are ordinarily taken to be Latin American (e.g., the\nindigenous peoples of Latin America).\nThe term is both too broad and too narrow since \u2018Latin\nAmerica\u2019 faces both of the previous problems.\n\n\nJorge Gracia (2011a, p. 8) offers a way around these problems by\ntaking \u2018Latin America\u2019 to refer to \u201ceverything in\nthe Americas that is not American (U.S.) or Canadian.\u201d This\nextensional, negative criterion gets things right provided it assumes\na cultural understanding of \u2018American (U.S.)\u2019 and\n\u2018Canadian.\u2019 Without that assumption, the criterion would\nbe both too narrow and too broad, for it would exclude Puerto Rico,\nwhich is politically part of the U.S., and include St. Pierre and\nMiquelon, which are French islands off the coast of Canada. But Gracia\n(2011a, p. 8) seems to have in mind the relevant cultural\nunderstanding of the term, because he notes that \u201cthose parts of\nthe Caribbean and South America that were French, Dutch, or English\ncolonies, such as Haiti and Jamaica\u201d are not part of Latin\nAmerica (i.e., culturally understood).\n\nOn the other hand, Eduardo Rabossi (2003) explicitly provides a set of\nintensional criteria, which he appears to consider necessary and\nsufficient for falling under the reference of \u2018Latin\nAmerica.\u2019 According to them, the term denotes certain\n\u201cstates\u201d of North, Central, and South America by virtue of\ntheir sharing \u201ca common political origin (Spanish/Portuguese\nconquest), a similar linguistic heritage (Spanish/Portuguese), a\ndominant religion (Catholicism), and comparable predicaments vis\n\u00e0 vis local, regional, and international affairs\u201d\n(Rabossi 2003, p. 507). Rabossi\u2019s criteria, which are more\nrestrictive, avoid being too broad, but face the problem of being too\nnarrow, which makes them unsatisfactory.\n\nGuillermo Hurtado\u2019s (2010) reflection on the adequacy of the\nqualifier \u2018Latin American\u2019 illustrates the pragmatic\nproblem mentioned above. First, Hurtado too takes \u2018Latin\nAmerica\u2019 to denote a culturally specific region of the Americas,\none individuated by appeal to language: viz., being a region of the\nAmericas that mostly speaks Spanish, Portuguese or French. Perhaps\naware of the problem of being too broad, Hurtado attempts to avoid it\nby excluding Quebec from the designation of \u2018Latin\nAmerica\u2019 on the seemingly ad hoc ground that the region\nis surrounded by mostly \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 Canada. In any case,\nhis account of \u2018Latin American\u2019 and \u2018the Latin\nAmerican\u2019 appears to point to a pragmatic problem arising from\nsome facts about those terms\u2019 introduction into public\ndiscourse. According to Hurtado, there is historical evidence that\nthey were introduced into public discourse in the late nineteenth\ncentury by the French, who did so in order to advance their national\ninterest in dealing with the Latin and Catholic nations of the\nAmericas (as opposed to the Protestant and \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019\nnations). Once these terms had caught on in thought and language,\ntheir role in discourse was unaffected by the defeat of the French in\nthe region, except for the fact that \u2018Latin America\u2019 came\ninstead to be just \u201can ideal of union among the nations\nthat compose it\u201d (Hurtado 2010, p. 11, my translation and\nemphasis). At the end of the day, however, Hurtado continues to use\nthese terms without explaining why we should do so, given that,\naccording to his own story, they were introduced for colonialist\npurposes\u2014and therefore face the pragmatic\n problem.[3]\n In addition, given this account, it would seem that those terms now\nrefer to nothing objective at all.\n\nBe that as it may, let\u2019s now consider some of the other options.\n\u2018Iberoamerican\u2019 and \u2018Hispanic American\u2019 are\nthe closest relatives of \u2018Latin American.\u2019 Neither of\nthese alternatives is problem free, since they inherit the pragmatic\nproblem facing the nouns from whence they derive, \u2018Iberia\u2019\nand \u2018Hispania.\u2019 Each of these ancient proper names\ndesignates the European peninsula today divided into Spain and\nPortugal. Thus, taken literally, each has connotations unacceptable to\nthe descendants of the victims of these countries\u2019 colonial\npolicies in the Americas.\n\nOn the other hand, \u2018Hispanic philosophy\u2019 and\n\u2018Latino/a philosophy\u2019 are more recent terms whose semantic\nfeatures are not yet fully settled by usage. Roughly, \u2018Hispanic\nphilosophy\u2019 may include Iberian philosophy too (Gracia 2000),\nwhile \u2018Latino/a philosophy\u2019 is the philosophy of or about\nthe descendants of Latin Americans abroad, especially in the United\nStates (Gracia 2011b). As noted above in the cases of\n\u2018Iberoamerican\u2019 and \u2018Hispanic American,\u2019 both\n\u2018Hispanic\u2019 and \u2018Latino/a\u2019 also appear to have\ninherited the pragmatic problem for the proper nouns from which each\nderives (it should now be obvious to the reader what those problems\nare).\n\nBut it may be that no such pragmatic problem matters after all for\njustifying the current use of \u2018Latin American\u2019 or some of\nthe alternative terms. That would be so if the reference of the proper\nname from which any such term derives is direct, in the sense that it\nis not mediated by the term\u2019s descriptive\n meaning.[4]\n On this account, the justification for using the term needs only\nappeal to linguistic convention.\n",
