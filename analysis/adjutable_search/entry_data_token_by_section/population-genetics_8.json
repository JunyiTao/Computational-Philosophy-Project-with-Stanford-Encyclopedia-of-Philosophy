    "main_text": "Random Drift\n4. Random Drift\n\nRandom genetic drift refers to the chance fluctuations in gene\nfrequency that arise in finite populations. In many evolutionary\nmodels, including those outlined in section 3 above. the population is\nassumed to be very large (technically, infinite) precisely in order to\nabstract away from such fluctuations. But though mathematically\nconvenient, this assumption is often unrealistic. In real life\npopulations, particularly those of small size, stochasticity is an\nimportant source of evolutionary change. Thus a given allele may\nincrease or decrease in frequency not because of any effect it has on\norganismic survival or reproduction, but simply by chance.\nUnderstanding such stochastic changes in gene frequency, and their\ninteraction with natural selection, is a major topic in population\ngenetics, past and present.\n\nThe term \u201crandom drift\u201d has both a narrow and a broad\nsense (Kimura 1964; Rice 2004; Millstein 2016). In the narrow sense,\nit refers to gene frequency changes that arise from the random\nsampling of gametes to form the offspring generation. (The point here\nis that organisms produce many more gametes than will ever make it\ninto a fertilized zygote, and only half of a diploid organism\u2019s\ngenes are transmitted to each gamete). In the broader sense, drift\nrefers to gene frequency changes arising from all stochastic factors,\nincluding for example random fluctuations in selection intensities, or\nin survival and mating success. The narrower sense of the term is used\nhere.\n\nRandom drift greatly complicates the task of the population\ngeneticist. For in the presence of drift, it is no longer possible to\ndeduce the genetic composition of the population in generation\n\\(t+1\\) from its composition in generation \\(t\\); so no\nrecurrence relation for an allele\u2019s frequency, of the sort\nexpressed in equation (1) above, can be derived. Instead, the aim must\nbe to deduce the probability distribution over all the\npossible genetic compositions of the population in generation\n\\(t+1\\). From this, it is sometimes possible to extract a\nprediction about the long-term fate of an allele.\n\nThe simplest and most widely-used model for analysing random drift is\nknown as the Wright-Fisher model. This model deals with a\nfinite population containing \\(N\\) diploid organisms. \\(N\\)\nis assumed constant over generations (perhaps because of ecological\nconstraints). Generations are non-overlapping, meaning that parents\ndie as soon as they have reproduced, and mating is random. Selection,\nmigration and mutation are assumed absent. The offspring generation is\nformed by randomly sampling \\(2N\\) of the gametes produced by the\nparental generation. Time is discrete, with one generation\ncorresponding to one time period. Consider a particular allele of\ninterest. Let \\(X(t)\\) denote the number of copies of\nthe allele in the population in generation \\(t\\), where \\(0 \\leq\nX(t) \\leq 2N\\) (since organisms are diploid). The allele\u2019s\nfrequency \\(p(t)\\) is then equal to \\(\\frac{1}{2N}X(t),\\)\nwhere \\(0 \\leq p(t) \\leq 1\\).\n\nWe are interested in \\(X(t+1)\\) and \\(p(t+1)\\), the number of copies\nand frequency of the allele in generation \\(t+1,\\) respectively. (They\nare related by \\(p(t+1) = \\frac{1}{2N}X(t+1).\\)) Now, \\(X(t+1)\\) is a\nrandom variable that can take any of \\(2N+1\\) possible values from the\nset \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots ,2N\\}\\). Since the offspring generation is\nformed by random sampling from the parental gamete pool, the\nprobability distribution of \\(X(t+1)\\) is given by the binomial\ndistribution:\n\n\\[\n\\textit{Prob}(X(t+1) = x) = \\binom{2N}{x}p(t)^x(1-p(t))^{2N-x}\n\\]\n\n\nThis formula tells us, for each possible value of \\(X(t+1)\\), what its\nprobability is as a function of the population size \\(N\\) and the\nallele\u2019s frequency in the parental generation \\(p(t).\\) From\nthis, we can easily compute the expected value of \\(X(t+1)\\), denoted\n\\(E(X(t + 1))\\), which turns out to simply be equal to \\(X(t)\\). This\nis quite intuitive: since the second generation is formed by random\nsampling, the number of copies of the allele is just as likely to\nincrease as to decrease, so the expected number of copies in\ngeneration \\(t+1\\) equals the actual number of copies in generation\n\\(t.\\) It follows that the expected change in allele frequency from\ngeneration \\(t\\) to \\(t+1,\\) denoted \\(E(\\Delta p)\\), is equal to\nzero.\n\nThe fact that \\(E(\\Delta p) = 0\\) does not imply that drift will have\nno evolutionary effect. For \\(\\Delta p\\) may have a substantial\nvariance around the mean of zero (depending on the value of \\(N\\)), so\nit may be quite probable that \\(\\Delta p\\) deviates from zero by a\nsubstantial amount. (Similarly, if one flips a fair coin 20 times, the\nexpected number of heads is 10, but the probability that the actual\nnumber of heads is 8 or less is quite substantial \u2013\napproximately 25%). In the Wright-Fisher model, the variance of\n\\(\\Delta p\\) turns out to be \\(Var(\\Delta p) = \\frac{1}{2N}p(1-p)\\).\nThus as the population size increases, the variance of \\(\\Delta p\\)\ngets smaller and smaller, which illustrates the point that random\ndrift is more important in small than in large populations.\n\nWhat will happen in the long run? Under the assumptions of the\nWright-Fisher model, the sequence of allele frequencies in successive\ngenerations \\(\\{p(0), p(1), p(2), \\ldots \\}\\)constitutes what is known\nas a Markov chain, that is, a sequence of random variables\n(stochastic process) where the probability distribution of any\nvariable depends only on the value of the immediately preceding\nvariable. That is, the probability that the allele has a frequency of\n(say) 0.8 in generation \\(t+1\\), denoted \\(\\textit{Prob}(p(t+1) = 0.8)\\),\ndepends on the value of \\(p(t),\\) the allele\u2019s frequency in\ngeneration \\(t\\), but not on its frequency in earlier\ngenerations. Importantly, this Markov chain has a special feature,\nnamely that the the two extremal values of \\(p(t)\\), i.e., 0 and 1,\nare absorbing boundaries, meaning that if the system reaches\none of these boundaries it stays there. That is, if the allele goes\nextinct in generation \\(t\\), so has a frequency of zero, then in\nall subsequent generations its frequency will also be zero (since we\nare ignoring mutation). Similarly, if the allele goes to fixation in\ngeneration \\(t\\), it will remain fixed in subsequent generations.\nFormally, we can express these facts as: \\(\\textit{Prob}(p(t+1) = 0 \\mid p(t)\n= 0) = 1\\) and \\(\\textit{Prob}(p(t+1) = 1 \\mid p(t) = 1) = 1\\). Since there is\nno upper bound on the number of generations, eventually random drift\nmust lead the allele to go extinct or to become fixed in the\npopulation (and similarly for other alleles). This is because of the\nabsorbing boundary assumption, which implies that every stochastic\ntrajectory must eventually end up at \\(p(t) = 0\\) or \\(p(t) = 1\\), for\nsome value of \\(t.\\)\n\nThis leads naturally to the following question. What is the\nprobability that the allele will become fixed in the population,\nrather than going extinct? The Wright-Fisher model yields a very\nsimple answer to this question. If a given (neutral) allele has a\nfrequency \\(p(t)\\) in generation \\(t\\) , then the\nprobability that it eventually fixes is simply \\(p(t).\\)\nThis is a fairly intuitive result. For if the allele is rare, it is\nquite likely that it will be lost from the population by chance.\nConversely, if the allele is common, it is most unlikely to be lost\nfrom the population, as this would require an improbable series of\nchance events to occur together. An immediate consequence of this\nresult is that the probability of fixation of a novel (neutral)\ngenetic variant, that has arisen in the population by sporadic\nmutation, is \\(\\frac{1}{2N}\\) \u2013 since initially there is one copy of\nthe novel variant in the population. Thus for appreciable \\(N\\),\nit is overwhelmingly likely that any given novel variant will be lost\nto genetic drift. This illustrates the general fact that genetic drift\nhas a homogenizing tendency over many generations, reducing the\ngenetic variation in a population.\n\nImportantly, the equality between an allele\u2019s current frequency\nand its probability of becoming fixed assumes that the allele in\nquestion, and other alleles at the same locus, are selectively\nneutral\u2014meaning that random drift is the sole determinant of the\nchanges in frequency. If this assumption is relaxed, matters become\nmore complicated. The fate of an allele then depends on both drift and\non its selective advantage or disadvantage. This takes us beyond the\nconfines of the simple Wright-Fisher model since now there are two\nevolutionary factors at work\u2014random drift and natural selection.\nIn a finite population, an allele that is selectively advantageous, so\nhas a positive selection coefficient, will have a higher probability\nof fixation that a neutral allele; and conversely for one that is\nselectively disadvantageous. This is fairly obvious. What is less\nobvious, but still true, is that even if a novel variant arises that\nconfers a significant selective advantage, it is still more likely to\nbe eliminated by drift than to become fixed. To quantitatively study\nthe combined effects of selection and drift, population geneticists\nuse an advanced probabilistic technique known as diffusion analysis,\nwhich lies beyond the scope of this article (see Rice 2004 ch.5, Hartl\n2020, ch.6. or Otto and Day 2007, ch.15). But one key result deserves\nmention, which is that the eventual fate of an allele depends on the\nrelative magnitude of two quantities, namely \\(4N_e\\) and \\(s\\).\nHere \\(N_e\\) denotes the \u201ceffective population size\u201d\n(which corrects the actual population size to take account of\ndeviations from the idealized assumptions of the Wright-Fisher model),\nand \\(s\\) is the selection coefficient, which is a measure of the\nrelative fitness of organisms with the allele compared to organisms\nwithout, where \\(0 \\leq s \\leq 1\\). It turns out that if \\(4N_e s\n\\gg 1\\) then natural selection will determine the fate of an\nallele, while if \\(4N_e s \\ll 1\\) then drift will determine its\nfate.\n\nThe respective roles of drift and natural selection in molecular\nevolution was the subject of the selectionist versus neutralist\ncontroversy in the 1960s and 1970s, as noted in the Introduction (cf.\nDietrich 1994). The neutralist camp, headed by Kimura, argued that\nmost molecular variants had no effect on phenotype, so were not\nsubject to natural selection; random drift was instead the main\ndeterminant of their fate. Kimura argued that the apparently constant\nrate at which the amino acid sequences of proteins evolved, and the\nextent of genetic polymorphism observed in natural populations, could\nbest be explained by the neutralist hypothesis (Kimura 1977, 1994).\nSelectionists countered that natural selection was also capable of\nexplaining the observed polymorphism. The controversy ended without a\nclear victory for either side, in part due to paucity of data. However\nthe opposition between selection and drift remains a central topic in\nmolecular population genetics today, where there is an abundance of\ndata on DNA sequence variation in natural populations. Sophisticated\nmethods have been developed to allow researchers to hunt for\nsignatures of past selection in the genomes of modern organisms. It\nhas become clear that there is indeed much neutral molecular variation\nin DNA sequence (in part due to \u201csynonymous\u201d mutations\nthat leave unchanged the amino acid sequence of the protein that the\ngene codes for). However, there is also much evidence showing that the\ngenomes of contemporary species have been substantially influenced by\nnatural selection (Casillas and Barbadilla 2017, Kern and Hahn 2018).\nMoreover, the idea that drift is the sole determinant of a neutral\nvariant\u2019s frequency, as the original neutralists held, is not\nnecessarily true. Another possibility, championed by J. Gillespie\n(2004), is that a neutral variant\u2019s spread in a population may\nbe heavily influenced by selection at linked loci, a process known as\n\u201chitchhiking\u201d or \u201cgenetic draft\u201d; see Skipper\n(2004) for discussion. A recent evaluation of the selection versus\ndrift issue concludes that \u201cthe extent to which DNA sequence\nevolution is caused by selection versus drift remains an important\nunanswered general question\u201d (Charlesworth and Charlesworth\n2017, p.6).\n\nThough random drift is well-understood mathematically, and is the\nsubject of much empirical research in biology, a number of\nphilosophers have suggested that it is conceptually less clearcut than\none might think. Thus for example Millstein (2002) has argued that the\nterm \u201crandom drift\u201d as used by biologists is often\nambiguous as between a process (such as random sampling) and an\noutcome (such as change in gene frequency). Millstein\u2019s point\nhas given rise to a considerable philosophical literature on how\nexactly the terms \u201cdrift\u201d and \u201cselection\u201d\nshould be defined; see the entry on\n genetic drift\n for discussion and references.\n",
