    "main_text": "Personal and Intellectual Development || Wartime Political Writings\n1.7 Wartime Political Writings\n\n\nFor much of the First World War, Rosenzweig served in an\nanti-aircraft unit stationed on the Balkan front. Rosenzweig wrote a\nnumber of pseudonymous essays while serving at the front\u2014signed\n\u201cAdam Bund\u201d or \u201cMacedonicus\u201d\u2014exploring\nthe political ramifications of the war. Some of these essays show\nRosenzweig\u2019s interest in the possibility that Germany might\ndevelop through the war into the centerpiece of a\n\u201cmiddle-European\u201d empire. Rosenzweig\u2019s most original\npolitical composition of the war years was a sweeping account of\npolitical geography entitled, \u201cGlobus: Studies towards the\nWorld-Historical Doctrine of Space.\u201d \u201cGlobus\u201d was\nRosenzweig\u2019s attempt to take seriously the designation of the war\nin which he was participating as a World War. In it,\nRosenzweig presents the history of the shifting geographic landscape of\npolitical power in the world, from the Roman Empire to the present, as\nthe gradual realization of the unity of the globe. The current war,\nRosenzweig suggests, pits three world empires against one another to\ndecide which will guide the globe towards its ultimate unification.\nRosenzweig makes it clear, in \u201cGlobus,\u201d that he understands\nthe events of the war as rooted in the absolute trajectory of world\nhistory that began in the world\u2019s creation and will lead to its\nredemption.\n",
