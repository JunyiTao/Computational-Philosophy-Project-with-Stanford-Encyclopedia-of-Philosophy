    "main_text": "The Idle Argument\n8. Conclusion\n\nThere are a number of arguments for fatalism, and it seems that one\nway of countering all of them would be to adopt the Aristotelian\nsolution, or something akin to it. It would be neat if it could be\nmade out that this was the only solution, so that the fate of fatalism\nwas inextricably linked to the fate of the Aristotelian solution. But\nit does not seem that this is so, except possibly, on the assumption\nthat an omniscient God exists, in relation to middle knowledge. But\neven then, the solution is only a poor relation to the Aristotelian\nsolution.\n\nSo it is possible that both fatalism and the Aristotelian solution are\nwrong. And it is, of course, always possible, for all that has been\nsaid, that fatalism is correct.\n",
