    "main_text": "Other Goals for and Styles of Arguing || Gendered Reasoning\n2.1 Gendered Reasoning\n\nThe gendered associations of different styles of reasoning suggest\nthat a source for alternative models of arguing might be found in what\nhave been seen as \u201cfeminine\u201d styles of reasoning. Whether\nor not women reason differently from men depends on what we count as\nreasoning (Verbiest 1995), and the evidence from psychology and\nsociology reveals no significantly gendered differences in the mental\nprocesses of inference and cognition (Fine 2010). Yet women\u2019s\ncommunication practices often reflect distinct \u201cvalues of\nintimacy, connection, inclusion, and problem sharing\u201d (Burrow\n2010: 247).\n\nAyim argues that in order to avoid reinforcing patterns of\nsubordination, we must detect and examine how values and\npresuppositions play into the ways that we interpret argumentation\n(1988: 185). Rooney adds that cooperative and collaborative\ninclinations may involve a tendency to defer, a reluctance to take\nresponsibility for a position, or a lack of confidence in one\u2019s\nideas (2010: 213\u2013214). The need to appease those with greater\npower may explain why an open-ended and tentative quality sometimes\ndistinguishes women\u2019s style of arguing and practices of\ncommunication associated with femininity. Sylvia Burrow suggests that\nwomen may give others\u2019 interests priority over their own in\norder to secure cooperation and connection (2010). This may\ncharacterize subordinate roles more generally, sometimes extending to\nmarginalized races and ethnicities.\n\nWhile styles of \u201cfemininity\u201d and \u201cmasculinity\u201d\nare neither wholly good nor bad, they both have inherent dangers. A\ndanger for masculinity arises from its association with activity and\naggression as apparently natural features of maleness. As a result,\nthese masculine ideals constrain women\u2019s communication, as has\noften been noted by feminist theorists, while feminine modes tend to\nbe dismissed. Because masculine characteristics also operate as ideals\nof humanity or personhood (Hundleby 2016), men can over-identify with\nthem and have no motivation to reflect on or problematize their gender\nidentity (Bruner 1996).\n\nThe strategy of transgressing gender by adopting an aggressive\nmasculine mode for arguing can seem useful to women and the temptation\nmay be strongest in \u201cmasculine\u201d discourses such as\nphilosophical discussion, or wherever listeners treat an authoritative\nmanner as valuable. Yet, when women adopt masculine\ndiscursive styles and adversarial techniques, they can garner\ncriticism for being selfish, cold, and mean, which is criticism that\nmen would not receive (Burrow 2010). Furthermore, such character\nchallenges weaken women\u2019s authority and their ability to\nparticipate in argumentation (Burrow 2010; Hundleby 2013a). Even when\nthose challenges are not interpreted as a character fault, the effect\nmay be to present women as merely requesting permission to\nparticipate, whereas men are not taken to need permission (Kukla 2014;\nOlberding 2014). When women decline to offer explanations, they are\nconsidered incompetent, whereas the same behavior reads as strength in\nmen. Women\u2019s attempts to defend their authority can easily\nbackfire because the very nature of authority depends on not always\nhaving to defend what one says (Hanrahan & Antony 2005).\n",
