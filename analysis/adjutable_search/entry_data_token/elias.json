Introduction\n\nThe 6th century witnesses at once the culmination and the demise of a\nlong tradition of philosophical commentaries on the works of Plato and\nespecially Aristotle. This tradition already began in the 1st century\nBCE, but it becomes first tangible for us with the commentaries on\nAristotle of Aspasius in the 2nd century CE and especially with\nAlexander of Aphrodisias in the early 3rd century. This exegetical\ntradition reached its pinnacle in the first half of the 6th century\nwith the great works of Ammonius Hermeiou and his pupils Simplicius\nand John Philoponus. The latter was a Christian who, after much\ncriticism and polemic, broke with (pagan) Neoplatonic school\nphilosophy and turned his energy to the exegesis of biblical texts as\nwell as the theological controversies of his day. However, because of\nthe survival of even later commentaries attributed to philosophers\nwith Christian names such as Elias and David, it is commonly supposed\nthat in the later 6th century pagan philosophy was indeed still being\ntaught in Alexandria, only by Christians. This would then be in marked\ncontrast to Athens, where pagan philosophy died out rapidly after the\nAthenian academy was closed by Emperor Justinian in 529.\n2. Extant Writings\n\nThree works attributed to Elias have been published: a commentary on\nPorphyry\u2019s Isagoge, a commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories (both in Commentaria in Aristotelem\nGraeca Vol 18) and a third, highly truncated work on\nAristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics (see Westerink 1961). The\nauthor of these works may have been a pupil of Olympiodorus, and in\nthat case it is quite possible that the commentary on the\nIsagoge was composed in the form of a transcript of\nOlympiodorus\u2019 lectures.\n\nIn the tradition of Neoplatonic philosophical training,\nPorphyry\u2019s Isagoge and Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories were part of the standard curriculum for\nbeginners, a practice that was well established by the 5th and 6th\ncenturies. Like Ammonius Hermeiou before him, Elias prefaces the\nlectures on the Isagoge with a very general\n\u2018Introduction\u2019 to philosophy, a text that belongs to the\ngenre of protreptic or exhortational philosophical literature.\nElias\u2019exhortation to philosophy consists of 12 lectures designed\nto serve a triple purpose: 1. to outline and define the scope of\nphilosophy, 2. to justify the various topics of the lectures the\nstudents are about to hear, and 3. to motivate them in a general way\nto pursue a course in philosophy.\n\nTo some extent, Elias\u2019 introduction to philosophy brings out the\nindividual character and temperament of the author. He comes across as\na very lively lecturer who dazzled his students with quotations and\nallusions of many kinds. For example, in his 12 introductory lectures,\nPlato is mentioned 22 times; there are 15 quotations from Homer as\nwell as numerous scattered references to Aristotle, Plotinus, Proclus,\nMarinus, Hierocles, Pythagoras, Archilochus, Theognis, Herodotus,\nCallimachus, Demosthenes, Sophocles, Euripides, Menander, Galen and an\nunnamed Stoic. Moreover, Elias repeatedly emphasizes the\nPlatonic-Neoplatonic conviction that the purpose of philosophy is the\ntransformation or assimilation of a human being to the godhead, a\ngenuinely Platonic ideal explicitly stated in the Theaetetus,\n176A-B. Given that by the late 6th century a professor in Alexandria,\nor anywhere else in the Eastern empire, would address a predominantly,\nif not exclusively, Christian audience, these remarks give one pause,\nespecially if one believes that they stem from an author who, if the\nattribution to \u201cElias\u201d can be trusted, himself subscribed\nto Christianity. For a Christian, of course, drawing near the godhead\nwould not be the result of reading and embracing Platonic philosophy\nbut of divine grace that depended on faith.\n\nIn his preface to Aristotle\u2019s Categories, Elias gives a\nconcise and admirable summary of the qualities an ideal commentator\nought to have (CAG 18.1, pp. 122f. as quoted by Wilson 1983,\n47):\n\nThe commentator should be both commentator and scholar at the same\ntime. It is the task of the commentator to unravel obscurities in the\ntext; it is the task of the scholar to judge what is true and what is\nfalse, or what is sterile and what is productive. He must not\nassimilate himself to the authors he expounds, like actors on the\nstage who put on different masks because they are imitating different\ncharacters. When expounding Aristotle he must not become an\nAristotelian and say there has never been so great a philosopher; when\nexpounding Plato he must not become a Platonist and say that there has\nnever been a philosopher to match Plato. He must not force the text at\nall costs and say that the ancient author whom he is expounding is\ncorrect in every respect; instead he must repeat to himself at all\ntimes \u2018the author is a dear friend, but so also is truth, and\nwhen both stand before me truth is the better friend\u2019. He must\nnot sympathise with a philosophical school, as happened to Iamblichus,\nwho out of sympathy for Plato is condescending in his attitude to\nAristotle and will not contradict Plato in regard to the theory of\nideas. He must not be hostile to a philosophical school like Alexander\n(of Aphrodisias). The latter, being hostile to the immortality of the\nintellectual part of the soul, attempts to twist in every way the\nremarks of Aristotle in his third book on the immortality of the soul\nwhich prove that it is immortal. The commentator must know the whole\nof Aristotle in order that, having first proved that Aristotle is\nconsistent with himself, he may expound Aristotle\u2019s works by\nmeans of Aristotle\u2019s works. He must know the whole of Plato, in\norder to prove that Plato is consistent with himself and make the\nworks of Aristotle an introduction to those of Plato.\n\n3. The Problem of Authorship\n\nThe title of a recently published manuscript, dated to the 13th or\n14th century and containing a Prior Analytics commentary,\nsuggests that Elias, who is named as the author of the commentary,\nonce held the office of prefect in the Byzantine empire. In the\nNovellae of Justinian, a prefect by the name of Elias is\nindeed mentioned (Novel. CLIII, dated 12 December 541; cf.\nWesterink 1961). Since the name Elias was rare in secular circles at\nthe time, Westerink proposes that unless evidence to the contrary\nemerges our commentator and the prefect should be considered\nidentical. A (praetorian or urban) prefect in the late Roman Empire\nwas, as direct representative of the emperor, the highest civilian\nadministrator of a region or city (most importantly Rome or\nConstantinople). If our commentator really held such an illustrious\noffice, presumably after he had established himself as professor of\nphilosophy (cf. the life of Themistius), he most likely also came from\na high-ranking family of nobles. Unfortunately, apart from the scant\nevidence found in the late manuscripts of the extant commentaries\nnothing further is known about a philosopher or prefect by the name of\nElias. A fairly comprehensive Byzantine list of commentators on\nPorphyry and Aristotle does not know of any philosopher by that name,\nnor do Photius (9th c. Byzantine scholar) and the author of the Suda,\na 10th c. encyclopedia. A closer look at the manuscript tradition\nreveals that the texts now attributed to Elias circulated as anonymous\nmanuscripts for a considerable time, meaning that the attribution to\none \u201cElias\u201d is a much later addition. Given that there is\nnothing explicitly Christian about these works (there are no\nreferences to the Bible, but the text abounds with references to pagan\nphilosophers and literary figures), and given that we find an explicit\navowal of doctrines that are quite obviously at variance with\nChristianity (e.g. that a philosopher must strive to imitate the sun;\nthat the world is eternal), it is possible to adopt a more skeptical\nposition (cf. Wildberg 1990). That is to say, the suspicion arises\nthat the original author may not have been Christian at all, but a\nlatter-day pagan who, like Olympiodorus, taught Greek philosophy to a\nChristian audience. In that case, the attribution of these\ncommentaries to some \u201cElias\u201d may well have been motivated\nby monastic scribes who sought to justify copying these pagan\nphilosophical texts by inventing a good Christian name for their\nauthor. Alternatively, if the author was indeed the Christian prefect\nElias, as Westerink suggests, we are invited to modify our\npreconceptions about the possibility of pagan philosophical discourse\nwithin the Christian culture of the Byzantine empire. In either case,\nthe commentaries testify to the vitality and importance of pagan\nphilosophy and learning in the mid- or late 6th century CE.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Blumenthal, H.J., 1981. \u201cPseudo-Elias and the Isagoge\ncommentaries again,\u201d <em>Rheinisches Museum</em>, 124:\n188\u201392.", "Busse, A., 1892. \u201cDie neuplatonischen Ausleger der Isagoge\ndes Porphyrius,\u201d <em>Wissenschaftliche Beilage zum Programme des\nFriedrichs-Gymnasiums</em>, Berlin", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1900. <em>Eliae in Porphyrii Isagogen et\nAristotelis Categorias Commentaria</em>, <em>Commentaria in\nAristotelem Graeca</em> (<em>CAG</em>), 18.1.
