    "main_text": "Extension || The Extension Question\n2.2 The Extension Question\n\nIf\u2014contra the Umbrella View\u2014it is not true by\ndefinition that \u2018object\u2019 picks out a maximally\ngeneral category, then there may be things that are not objects. So\nthe Extension Question may turn out to have a different answer than\nthe ontological question. And even if one and the same class or\ncollection is identified as the correct answer to each question, it\ndoes not follow that the questions are the same; even if everything is\nan object, it need not be true by definition that the extension of\n\u2018object\u2019 is just what there is. So we will also survey\nanswers to the Extension Question that have it that object\npicks out (at least intensionally) a different group of things than\none\u2019s answer to the ontological question.\n2.2.1 Ordinary Objects\n\nFor those who don\u2019t accept the Umbrella View, the Extension\nQuestion is distinct from the ontological question. What, then, does\nthe Extension Question amount to? Presumably one who denies the\nUmbrella View thinks that there are objects, and non-objects. Put\nanother way, her answer to the ontological question includes objects\nand other things. For her, the Extension Question is the following: of\nall the things there are, which ones are the objects? Those who deny\nthe Umbrella View have a variety of ways of dividing the objects from\nthe non-objects, which we discussed in\n \u00a71.2.\n\nAnother way of dividing the objects from the non-objects is not by\nfirst answering the ontological question and then picking out the\nobjects from all the things, or by answering the Contrast Question and\nthen placing things into either object or its contrast class.\nRather, one could simply start with the Extension Question\u2014one\ncould start by listing the obvious and ordinary candidates for the\noffice of object (see entry on\n ordinary objects).\n\nA common way to start would be by listing the things we ordinarily\ntake to be objects in our pre-philosophical approach to the world.\nRecall the Tugendhat quotation from above: \u201cIn ordinary language\nwe are inclined to call only material objects\n\u2018objects\u2019.\u201d The view is that the extension of\nobject is all and only the things we normally think about and\ntalk about and refer to and use. These things are nameable,\nidentifiable, stable, and persist through time. Examples include bees,\nerasers, pillows, and boats.\n\nTwo thoughts arise. First, such an answer to the Extension Question\nleads to many puzzles and problems. Second, simply listing all the\nthings is pretty dissatisfying as an answer to the Extension Question.\nBetter to give a general answer and then see what it entails\u2014in\nparticular, what entailments it has for the Extension Question. What\nfollows is one method for giving a general answer to what objects\nthere\n are.[20]\n2.2.2 Special Composition Question\n\nMost who have considered the Extension Question probably think there\nare such objects as photons, electrons, quarks and other things that\nscience deals with\u2014the fundamental physical particles. And those\nthings seem to make up other things, like atoms, molecules, elements,\ncells, and so on up the size chain to medium-sized dry goods, large\nbuildings, mountains, and planets.\n\nSo it seems that things are often composed of other things. But under\nwhat conditions does composition occur? van Inwagen (1990) calls this\n\u2018The Special Composition Question\u2019 (hereafter \u2018the\nSCQ\u2019). More precisely, the SCQ calls for filling in for \u03a6 in\nthe following sentence: For any xs, there exists a y\nsuch that the xs compose y iff \u03a6. An answer must\nbe non-analytic and must have only \u2018the xs\u2019\n free.[21]\n\nHere are some candidate answers to the SCQ. Contact: \u2018the\nxs are in contact\u2019. Life: \u2018the xs are\ncaught up in a life\u2019. Mereological Nihilism: \u2018there is\nonly one of the xs\u2019. Mereological Universalism:\n\u2018the xs are one or more in number\u2019.\n\nAnyone who denies the Umbrella View and who has an answer to the SCQ\ncan consider that as a partial answer to the Extension Question. What\nobjects are there? Contact says that there are the xs, and\nfor any xs that are in contact, there\u2019s another object\n(the one that\u2019s composed of them). Life says that there are the\nxs, and for any xs that are caught up in a life,\nthere\u2019s another object (the one that\u2019s composed of them).\nMereological Nihilism says that there are just the xs, and no\nother objects. Mereological Universalism says that there are the\nxs, for any xs at all (no matter how they are\narranged), there\u2019s another object (the one that\u2019s composed\nof them). And so on for other answers.\n3. Nature\n\nThus far we have asked two questions of object: (i) what, if\nany, is its contrast? (ii) what things, if any, are in its extension?\nThese questions might also be phrased as the questions of what\nnon-objects there are and of what objects there are. We turn now to\nour final question: (iii) supposing there are objects, what are they\nlike? What is their nature?\n\nOne way to specify the nature of a category is to note the theoretical\nrole it plays or the role played by items within it. This is to say\nwhat items within the category do. Another is to give a real\ndefinition of the category (or the items within it), where a real\ndefinition attempts to identify the real essence of the members of the\ncategory. This is to say what items of within category are\n(see entries on\n theoretical terms in science\n and\n Locke on real essence\n and the section on real and nominal definitions in the entry on\n definitions).\n\nIn this section, we will consider attempts to state the nature of\nobjects. As with our treatment of the Contrast Question, our\ndiscussion will elide some terminological details. Instead of treating\nonly theories of the nature of objects phrased in precisely those\nterms, we will canvas several attempts to state the nature of nearby\ncategories as well\u2014most notably substance and\nparticular\u2014treating them as giving a theory of the\nnature of objects.\n3.1 What Objects Do\n\nOne way to explain a thing or category is to mark out what it\ndoes\u2014its role. Since object is, on any view at all, a\nhighly abstract and general category, the relevant role by which\nobject might be defined must itself be highly abstract and\n general.[22]\n Three examples:\n\nFirst, various linguistic items, it seems, denote or refer.\n\u201cArmstrong\u201d denotes Armstrong, \u201credness\u201d\ndenotes redness, \u201cthe successor of zero\u201d denotes the\nnumber 1, and so on. Reflection on these platitudes brings to the fore\na role that we might call being an object of reference (or\nperhaps some related modal notion such as possibly being an object\nof reference or being eligible for reference).\n\nSecond, domains (classes or pluralities), it seems, are associated\nwith quantifiers (expressions like \u201csome\u201d and\n\u201cevery\u201d). \u201cEverything is so-and-so\u201d quantifies\nover all items within an inclusive domain (maximally inclusive, one\nthinks) and says of each of those items that it is so-and-so.\nReflection on these platitudes brings to the fore a role we might call\nbeing quantified over, or perhaps some related modal notion\nsuch as possibly being quantified over or being a\ncandidate for being quantified over.\n\nThird, some thoughts are, it seems, about things. The thought that\nAristotle was a philosopher is at least in part about a certain\nperson\u2014Aristotle. The thought that doing metaphysics is a fine\npastime is at least in part about a certain activity. And the thought\nthat Platonism is sensible is at least in part about a certain\nphilosophical theory. Reflection on these platitudes brings to the\nfore a role we might call being an object of thought or\nbeing thought of, or perhaps some related modal notion such\nas being possibly thought\n of.[23]\n\nThese three examples isolate highly abstract or general\nroles\u2014being an object of reference, being quantified over, or\nbeing thought of. These roles are specified, as it were, by form\nrather than content; the roles alone impose very few limitations or\nrequirements on the kinds of things that fill them. Plausibly, for\nexample, both concrete material objects and abstract propositions\nalike might satisfy any of these roles. These three examples involve\nroles specified in part by connection to thought or language. But\nthese connections may be severed. We might, for example, specify the\nobject role as being a bearer of properties (this would be a natural\nextension of the view discussed in 1.2.7, or a non-linguistic\nextension of the view discussed in 1.2.1).\n\nAnd each role suggests, in turn, a theory of what objects are: (i) to\nbe an object just is to be a referent, (ii) to be an object just is to\nbe quantified over, and (iii) to be an object just is to be an object\nof\n thought.[24]\n van Inwagen offers a version of (i) here (note the use of\n\u201ccan\u201d indicating that it is a modal role that\nobjects play, namely being possible referents; we here presuppose the\nalready mentioned tight connection between \u2018object\u2019 and\n\u2018thing\u2019):\n\n\nThe most general metaphysical category is the category\n\u201cthing\u201d. I use \u2018thing\u2019 as the most general\ncount-noun. Everything is a thing. A thing is anything that can be\nreferred to by a third-person singular pronoun\u2014as when I say,\n\u201cThe following is true of everything, that it is identical with\nitself.\u201d The category \u201cthing\u201d comprises everything\nthere is, everything that exists (for I take a stern anti-Meinongian\nline about non-existents: non-existents simply don\u2019t exist: the\nnumber of them is 0). (2007: 199)\n\n\nThese role-theoretic specifications of what it is to be an object will\nhave consequences with respect to the Extension Question and the\nContrast Question. If literally every thing at all is eligible for\nreference or quantification or thought, for example, then literally\nevery thing would be an object, a thesis in line with the Umbrella\nView. If, on the other hand, some items are not eligible for reference\nor quantification or thought, then such items would fall under\nnon-object, and the category object would turn out\nto have a contrast or complement. Similarly, if , say, both concrete\nmaterial objects, abstract propositions are eligible for reference or\nquantification or thought, then items of both sorts would fall under\nthe extension of\n object.[25]\n3.2 What Objects Are\n\nSome think there\u2019s more to being an object than playing a\nparticular theoretical role. On this view, what it is for something to\nbe an object is a matter of that thing\u2019s intrinsic character or\nnature. One way of giving the intrinsic nature of a thing is by giving\na real definition. Says Dasgupta (2014), a real definition is:\n\n\na statement of what something is\u2026 For example, when one says\nthat {Socrates} is the unique singleton containing Socrates, one is\ndefining what the set is\u2014that is, giving its real definition.\nOr, equivalently, one is stating its essence or nature\u2026 (2014:\n577)\n\n\nStatements of what something is\u2014of a thing\u2019s essence or\nnature\u2014could take a variety of forms. One says what it is to be\nthat thing; the real definition of x might be put: to be\nx is to be y. Or the real definition of a category\nF: to be an F is to be a G. When one says,\n\u201cTo be a bachelor is to be an unmarried male\u201d, one is\ngiving the real definition of bachelorhood.\n\nAnother way is to say what is essential to an object or category, as\nsuggested by Fine (1995): It is essential to x that \u03a6.\nOr, it is essential to Fs that \u03a6.\n\nIn any case, the task at hand is not to write a section about what it\nis to be a real definition, but rather how the notion relates to\nobject.\n\nIf one thinks real definitions best get at the nature of things, and\none is interested in stating the nature of object or of\nobjects, there are two options. One is to substitute for \u03a6 in the\nfollowing: To be an object is to be \u03a6. The second is to substitute\nfor \u03a6 in the following: It is essential to objects that \u03a6.\n\nNote the difference between this method and the method of giving\nnecessary and sufficient conditions: x is an object iff\n\u03a6. If one has a contrast class in mind, then presumably one can\nsubstitute for \u03a6 the negation of that contrast class, e.g.,\n\u201cx is an object iff x is not a\nproperty\u201d. But that isn\u2019t what it is to be an\nobject. A real definition demands more.\n\nOne might think that object doesn\u2019t have a real\ndefinition. It may be that the contrast class (property, say)\nis a natural class, but object is not.\n\nOntologies\u2014roughly, abstract and systematic catalogues of the\nkinds of things there are\u2014divide on the question of how objects\nrelate to their properties. On constituent ontologies,\nproperties are parts or constituents or components of the objects that\nhave them or that they characterize (see entry on\n mereology).\n So on constituent ontologies, a tall tree has tall, somehow,\nas a part or constituent or component. On relational\nontologies, properties are not in any sense parts or constituents or\ncomponents of the objects that have them or that they characterize. So\non relational ontologies, though a tall tree bears an interesting\nrelationship to tall (perhaps it bears the\ninstantiation relation to that property), tall is\nnot among the tree\u2019s various parts or constituents or\n components.[26]\n\nWe will canvas three theories of objects that draw from constituent\nontologies, and then describe a relational alternative.\n3.2.1 Constituent Ontologies\n\nConstituent ontologists agree that objects have properties or\nproperty-like items as constituents or parts. They disagree, however,\nover whether objects have additional non-property-like items as\nconstituents or parts and over how the constituents or parts of\nobjects are related.\nBundle theory\n\nAccording to the bundle theory, objects are bundles of properties.\nDifferent theories of properties will make for different versions of\nthe bundle theory. The most common theories of properties for bundle\ntheorists to hold are\n trope theory (see entry on tropes)\n and immanent universals.\n\nOn the immanent universal version of the bundle theory, objects are\nbundles of universals, and those universals are located in space and\ntime. When some universals are compresent, however compresence is to\nbe understood (and perhaps when some other condition is satisfied),\nthere is an object that is the bundle of those universals. (For some\nbundle theorists, not just any group of immanent universals forms a\nbundle.) The way it\u2019s often put is that objects are bundles of\ncoinstantiated universals, where the coinstantiation relation\nmay be a primitive\n relation.[27]\n\nOn the trope version of the bundle theory, objects are bundles of\ntropes. Like the immanent universal version, not just any collection\nof tropes forms a bundle which is an object; the tropes have to be\ncompresent. The compresence relation is taken to be\n primitive.[28]\n\nThe bundle theory is a theory about objects according to which objects\nare composed of items of a different kind or category (namely,\n properties).[29]\n So the bundle theory suggests that object has a contrast or\ncomplement. The bundle theory also suggests this broad answer to the\nExtension Question: whenever there is a bundle of coinstantiated\nuniversals (or, alternatively, compresent tropes), there is an object.\nThe extension of object includes all and only the bundles,\nand what bundles there are is determined by which immanent universals\nor tropes stand in the coinstantiation or compresence\n relation.[30]\nBare particularism\n\nLike the bundle theory, bare particularism maintains that objects have\ntheir properties as constituents. But bare particularism adds that\nthere\u2019s something else too. In addition to its properties, every\nobject has as a constituent a bare particular (or \u2018thin\nparticular\u2019 or \u2018substratum\u2019) that instantiates those\nproperties. Bare particulars are \u2018bare\u2019 in at least this\nsense: unlike objects, they have no properties as parts.\n\nBare particularism, then, is the conjunction of two theses. First,\nevery object has at least two kinds of constituents: its properties\nand its bare particular. Second, every object has its properties by\nhaving as constituents properties that are instantiated by another of\nits constituents: its bare particular.\n\nBare particulars play two important roles in the theory at hand.\nFirst, they are the subjects of properties or the items to\nwhich the properties are attached by instantiation or exemplification.\nThus Alston:\n\n\nWe must ask concerning any situation involving this relation (e.g., a\nexemplifying [Greenness]) what the relata are. One of them is a\nuniversal. What is the other? It will obviously not do to\nreply\u2014a grum (defined as an instance of [greenness]); for this\nwould amount to saying that the relatum in question is that which\nstands in the instancing relation to [Greenness]; true enough but\nhardly enlightening. It still leaves open the question\u2014what is\nit that stands in the instancing relation to [Greenness]? \u2026the\nonly alternative left appears to be a \u2018bare\u2019 particular,\nor what I prefer to call a substratum. Once we see the need for\nsupplying an entity to which the universal involved bears the relation\nof being exemplified, we can see that only a bare particular would do\nthe job. (1954: 255)\n\n\nSecond, bare particulars individuate. Consider two objects\nthat are exactly alike in relevant respects (they are both royal blue,\nweigh 1kg, and so on); what could make them two and not\none? What might explain their distinctness? Since they are\nexactly alike in relevant respects no appeal to differences in their\nproperty-like constituents (being royal blue, weighing 1 kg, and so\non) would seem to do the trick. So, the bare particularists maintain,\nthere must be non-property-like constituents by virtue of which they\nare\n distinct.[31]\nHylomorphism\n\nAccording to hylomorphism, objects consist of matter and form\n(see entry on\n form vs. matter).\n Objects are comprised of various parts: electrons and upquarks, for\nexample. In addition to these ordinary material parts, objects have\nrather special components or\nconstituents\u2014forms\u2014property-like items that\ninform the matter of their host substance. Forms give objects\nstructure and shape and are what make each object the kind of thing it\nis. Forms account for the character or nature of objects; they are\nproperty-like in that respect. Socrates, for example, is a human\nanimal comprising form and matter; and Socrates is a human animal\nbecause he has a certain form as a constituent.\n\nHylomorphism may be thought of as a special case of or variation on\nthe bare particular view. For on hylomorphism, an object has both a\nproperty-like constituent (in this case, form) that bears a\nspecial tie to non-property-like constituents (in this case,\n matter).[32]\n3.2.2 Relational Ontologies\n\nWe turn now to relational ontologies. Constituent ontologies, recall,\nhave it that objects have properties as parts or constituents.\nRelational ontologies accept that the extension of both\nobject and property is not\n empty[33]\u2014but\n for them, no object has any property as a part or constituent.\nObjects are, one might say with Armstrong, blobs (1989: 76\u201377).\nMost relational ontologists will be perfectly happy to say that\nobjects have parts\u2014it\u2019s just that none of those parts are\nproperties; they\u2019re other objects.\nObjects as blobs\n\nIn contrast to the constituent ontologies surveyed above, relational\nontologies posit no internal structure to objects beyond ordinary\nmereological structure. Objects are not layer-cakes of thin\nparticulars and properties (or layer-cakes of matter and form); they\nare blobs instead. Put this way, the blob view of objects has only\nnegative content; it tells us what objects are not. It\noffers, then, a partial account of the nature of objects, and thus\ninvites\n supplementation.[34]\n\nWe will now consider two relational ontologies and their implications\nfor the theory of objects.\nPlatonism\n\nThe Platonist view of properties is that they are transcendent\nuniversals. They exist independently, and are outside of space and\ntime, unchanging, and causally inert. Clearly such things cannot be\nparts of ordinary material objects which are inside space and time,\nchange, and participate in causal chains. But objects still are red,\nlarge, heavy, and the like\u2014and this in virtue of standing in\nsome relation to the transcendent universals. That relation is usually\ncalled exemplification or instantiation, and it is\ntaken as primitive. But, importantly, it is\nexternal\u2014objects are related to things outside of\nthemselves\u2014whereas the relation between object and property on\nconstituent ontologies is internal.\n\nSo, while Platonism is primarily a view about the nature of\nproperties, it has implications for the nature of objects. In\nparticular, it entails that they don\u2019t have properties as parts.\nAs Armstrong puts the point:\n\n\nIt is interesting to notice that a separate-realm theory of universals\npermits of a blob as opposed to a layer-cake view of particulars. For\non this view, what is it for a thing to have a property? It is not the\nthing\u2019s having some internal feature, but rather its having a\nrelationship, the instantiation relationship, to certain universals or\nForms in another realm. The thing itself could be bloblike. (Armstrong\n1989: 76\u201377)\n\n\nAs it turns out, Platonism is not the only account of properties that\nsits well with an unstructured or bloblike view of objects.\nClass Nominalism\n\nOn class nominalism, properties are classes of things or classes of\npossible things. The property being green is the class of all\ngreen things, the property being wise is the class of all\nwise things, the relation is the sister of is the class of\nordered pairs the first member of which is the sister of the second\nmember, and so on.\n [35]\n\nFor an object to have (or exemplify, or instantiate, or whatever) a\nproperty, on this view, is for it to belong to a class of things.\nClass membership, like set membership, is an external relation; so\nclass nominalism sits best with a blob view of objects. van Inwagen\nexplains this connection as follows:\n\n\nAccording to Lewis [a class nominalist], a property is a set of\npossible objects. (Something is a property if and only if it is a set\nall of whose members are possible objects.) The property of being a\npig or porcinity, Lewis says, is simply the set of all possible\npigs\u2014a set far larger than the set of actual pigs. Consider an\nactual pig, Freddy. Freddy of course has porcinity. And what is this\nrelation \u201chaving\u201d that holds between the pig and the\nproperty? Why, simply set-membership. And the relation that a set of\npossibilia bears to its individual members is certainly not\nconstituency. Freddy is no doubt in some sense a constituent of the\nset of all possible pigs\u2014\u2018constituent\u2019 is a very\nflexible word, and it is probably flexible enough to permit that\napplication \u2014, but there is no conceivable sense in which the\nset of all possible pigs is a constituent of Freddy.
