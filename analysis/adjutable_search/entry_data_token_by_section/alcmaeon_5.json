    "main_text": "Epistemology and Psychology || Understanding and Empiricism\n2.2 Understanding and Empiricism\n\nAccording to Theophrastus, Alcmaeon was the first Greek thinker to\ndistinguish between sense perception and understanding and to use this\ndistinction to separate animals, which only have sense perception,\nfrom humans, who have both sense perception and understanding (DK,\nB1a, A5). Alcmaeon is also the first to argue that the brain is the\ncentral organ of sensation and thought (DK, A5, A8, A10). There is no\nexplicit evidence, however, as to what Alcmaeon meant by\nunderstanding. The word translated as understanding here is\nsuni\u00eami, which in its earliest uses means \u201cto\nbring together,\u201d so that it is possible that Alcmaeon simply\nmeant that humans are able to bring the information provided by the\nsenses together in a way that animals cannot (Solmsen 1961, 151).\nAnimals have brains too, however, and thus might appear to be able to\ncarry out the simple correlation of the evidence from the various\nsenses, whereas the human ability to make inferences and judgments\n(DK, B1) appears to be a more plausible candidate for the distinctive\nactivity of human intelligence. It is possible that we should use a\npassage in Plato\u2019s Phaedo (96a-b = A11) to explicate\nfurther Alcmaeon\u2019s epistemology. The passage is part of\nSocrates\u2019 report of his early infatuation with natural science\nand with questions such as whether it is the blood, or air, or fire\nwith which we think. He also reports the view that it is the brain\nthat furnishes the sensations of hearing, sight, and smell. This\ncorresponds very well with Alcmaeon\u2019s view of the brain as the\ncentral sensory organ and, although Alcmaeon is not mentioned by name,\nmany scholars think that Plato must be referring to him here. Socrates\nconnects this view of the brain with an empiricist epistemology, which\nAristotle will later adopt (Posterior Analytics 100a3 ff.).\nThis epistemology involves three steps: first, the brain provides the\nsensations of hearing, sight and smell, then, memory and opinion arise\nfrom these, and finally, when memory and opinion achieve fixity,\nknowledge arises. Some scholars suppose that this entire epistemology\nis Alcmaeon\u2019s (e.g., Barnes 1982, 149 ff.), while others more\ncautiously note that we only have explicit evidence that Alcmaeon took\nthe first step (e.g., Vlastos 1970, 47, n.8).\n",
