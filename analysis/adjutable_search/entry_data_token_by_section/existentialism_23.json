    "main_text": "Contemporary Relevance || Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science\n7.3 Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science\n\nBeginning with Hubert Dreyfus\u2019s (1972) groundbreaking critique\nof Artificial Intelligence (AI), philosophers of mind and cognitive\nscientists have been drawing on existentialist\nphilosophy\u2014especially Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty\u2014to\nchallenge the overly mentalistic picture of selfhood and agency that\nmodern philosophy inherits from Descartes and Kant and to dismantle\ntraditional representational theories of knowledge. Key works by Shaun\nGallagher (2005), Thomas Fuchs, (2018), and Dan Zahavi (2005) have\nreplaced the picture of the disembodied mind with the now widely\naccepted notion of the embedded, enactive, and embodied self. This is a\nrejection of the long-held assumption that human action must somehow be\nrepresented or \u201cmirrored\u201d in the mind. Existentialism\nilluminates how\u2014as a situated way of\nbeing-in-the-world\u2014human beings already embody a tacit\nunderstanding of the world in a way that we are not and can never be\nthematically conscious of. This means we do not understand things as\ndiscrete objects. We understand things in terms of how we use and\nhandle them and in terms of the purposive, meaning-giving roles these\nthings play in our everyday lives. The traditional view of the mind as\nsomething resembling the rule-governed processes of a computer program\nhave continually failed to capture this ambiguous and embodied sense of\nbeing-in-the-world.\n",
