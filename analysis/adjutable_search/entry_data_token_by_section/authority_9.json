A Second Form of Philosophical Anarchism\n\n\nAnother version of the philosophical anarchist challenge may seem to\navoid the critical edge of the above approach. This approach, defended\nby A. John Simmons (Simmons 2001) and Leslie Green (Green 1989) asserts\nthat each person has a right not to be bound by the state's commands.\nThis thesis is quite different from the kind of anarchism defended by\nWolff. The latter asserts that each individual has a duty to be\nautonomous. The present theory asserts merely that a person has a right\nnot be subjected to another's imposition of duties. The philosophical\nanarchist then argues that only if a person consents to being bound to\nthe political authority can the person actually be bound. The final\npremise in the philosophical anarchist argument is that it is either\npractically impossible or at least actually untrue that states can be\nset up in such a way that they can demand the obedience of all and only\nthose who have consented to their authority. So, the anarchist\nconcludes, no state is legitimate and perhaps no state can ever be\nlegitimate.\n\n\nIt is important to note that this view does not imply that one must\nnever obey the state. It merely implies that one does not have content\nindependent duties to obey the state and that the state does not have a\nright to rule. A reasonably just state will command one to do things\nthat are reasonably just and in many cases one must obey those commands\nbecause they are just. What one is not required to do on the\nphilosophical anarchist view is obey any state just because it has\ncommanded one to do certain things.\n\n\nTo discuss this view, we will first discuss the arguments people\nhave given for the consent theory of political authority. We will also\ndiscuss some counterarguments. Then we will discuss a popular\nmodification of the consent theory that is designed to avoid\nphilosophical anarchism.\n",
