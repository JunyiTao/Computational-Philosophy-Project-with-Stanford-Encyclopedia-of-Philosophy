    "main_text": "Biography\n2. Biography\n\n\nThe exact date of Ibn Daud\u2019s birth is unknown. It is commonly\nassumed that he was born c. 1110 in one of the major centers of Muslim\nSpain, perhaps Cordoba. He himself asserts that he received his\neducation from his maternal uncle, an uncle who is known to have been\nactive as both a teacher and a communal leader in Cordoba, where he\ndied in 1126. Although no further data are available, it is evident\nfrom his works that this education must have been a combination of\n\u201cGreek wisdom\u201d and traditional Jewish learning. Greek\nwisdom in the cultural setting of Andalusia refers to the study of\nclassical science and philosophy as taught by Muslim scholars and\nphilosophers. Indeed, his writings testify to a thorough familiarity\nwith Greek philosophy and science as read by the Muslim philosophers\nal-Farabi and Ibn Sina, as well as with rabbinic literature, Hebrew\npoetry, and Jewish philosophy. He also appears to have had some\nknowledge of the New Testament and Christian and Muslim polemical\nliterature. Later in life, Ibn Daud moved to Toledo, presumably as a\nresult of the Almohad invasion of Andalusia (1147), an event that led\nmany Jews to flee from Southern Spain. In any event it is in Toledo\nthat he wrote his two major works in defense of Judaism (circa\n1160/61): the philosophical treatise ER and the historical\nSefer ha-Qabbalah (cf. below section 3). Ibn Daud is reported\nto have died a martyr\u2019s death in Toledo c. 1180. The earliest\nreference to this was made by the Toledan philosophic author Judah ben\nSolomon ha-Kohen in his encyclopedia Midrash ha-Hokhmah (first\nhalf of the 13th century).\n\n\nSince 1954 scholars of Jewish and Latin philosophy have been intrigued\nby M.T. d\u2019Alverny\u2019s suggestion that Abraham Ibn Daud is the same\nperson as the twelfth-century Arabic-into-Latin translator Avendauth,\nalso known as \u201cAvendeuth philosophus israelita\u201d, who\ncollaborated with Dominicus Gundissalinus in Toledo. Though appealing,\nno indisputable proof could be provided for this\nidentification. Recent research on the Toledan Arabic-into-Latin\ntranslation program, however, has provided strong support in favor of\nd\u2019Alverny\u2019s identity-suggestion. The new studies portray Avendauth as\nthe motive force (Bertolacci 2011:54) behind the Latin translations of\nIbn Sina.(D\u2019Alverny 1954; Bertolacci\n2011; Burnett 2009; Fidora 2011; Hasse 2006; Schwartz 2013;Freudenthal 2016).\n",
