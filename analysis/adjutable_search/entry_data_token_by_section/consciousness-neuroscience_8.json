This raises a question that has\nepistemic implications: is access consciousness necessary for\nphenomenal consciousness? If it is not, then there can be phenomenal\nstates that are not access conscious, so are in principle not\nreportable. That is, phenomenal consciousness can overflow\naccess consciousness (Block 2007).\n\nAccess is tied to attention. For example, the Global Workspace theory\nof consciousness understands consciousness in terms of access\n (section 3.1)\n where the accessibility of a perceived object requires attention to\nthe object (attention puts an object, namely a representation of it,\nin the global workspace). So, the necessity of attention for\nphenomenal consciousness is entailed by the necessity of access for\nphenomenal\n consciousness.[5]\n In contrast, recurrent processing theory holds that there can be\nphenomenal states that are not accessible\n (section 3.2).\n\nMany scientists of consciousness take there to be evidence for no\nphenomenal consciousness without access and little if no evidence of\nphenomenal consciousness outside of access. An important set of\nstudies focuses on the thesis that attention is a necessary gate for\nphenomenal consciousness, where attention is tied to access. Call this\nthe gatekeeping thesis. To assess that evidence, we must ask:\nwhat is attention? An uncontroversial conception of attention is that\nit is subject selection of a target to inform task performance (Wu\n2014b). The experimental studies thought to support the necessity of\nattention for consciousness draw on this\n conception.[6]\n For example, in inattentional blindness paradigms (Mack\n& Rock 1998), attention is directed by asking subjects to perform\na task on target T while a surprising stimulus S is\npresented. This approach tests necessity by ensuring through task\nperformance that the subject is not attending to S. One then\nmeasures whether the subject is aware of S by observing whether\nthe subject reports it. If the subject does not report S, then\nthe hypothesis is that failure of attention to S explains the\nfailure of conscious awareness of S and hence the failure of\nreport.\n\nA well-known experiment asks subjects to attend to the number of\npasses of a ball thrown by players in white shirts while ignoring a\nsecond ball passed by players in black shirts (Simons & Chabris\n1999). During the task, a person in a gorilla costume walks across the\nscene. Half of the subjects fail to notice and report the gorilla,\nthis being construed as evidence for the absence of visual awareness\nof the gorilla. Hence, failure to attend to the gorilla is said to\nrender subjects phenomenally blind to it. Similar claims are made in\nchange blindness where subjects fail to detect the difference\nbetween two similar pictures (Simons & Ambinder 2005), the\nattentional blink where subjects fail to detect a stimulus\npresented immediately after detecting a prior stimulus (Dux &\nMarois 2009; Martens & Wyble 2010), and hemispatial\nneglect where patients fail to report objects in a part of their\nvisual field that they cannot attend to due to brain lesions.\n\nThe gatekeeping thesis holds that attention is necessary for\nconsciousness, so that removing it from a target eliminates\nconsciousness of it. Yet there is a flaw in the methodology. To report\na stimulus, one must attend to it, i.e., select it for report. The\nexperimental logic requires eliminating attention to a stimulus\nS to test if attention is a necessary condition for\nconsciousness (e.g., eliminating attention to the gorilla by\ndistracting the subject with the ball). Yet even if the subject were\nconscious of S, when attention to S is eliminated, one\ncan predict that the subject will fail to act (report) on\nS since attention is necessary for report. The observed results\nare actually consistent with the subject being conscious of S\nwithout attending to it, and thus are neutral between overflow and\ngatekeeping. Instead, the experiments concern parameters for the\ncapture of attention and not consciousness.\n\nWhile those antagonistic to overflow have argued that it is not\nempirically testable (M.A. Cohen & Dennett 2011), gatekeeping\nmight be equally untestable. After all, to test the necessity of\nattention for consciousness, we must eliminate attention to a target\nwhile gathering evidence for the absence of consciousness. Yet if\ngathering evidence for consciousness requires attention, then in\nfulfilling the conditions for testing the necessity of attention, we\nundercut the access needed to substantiate the absence of\nconsciousness (Wu 2017; for a monograph length discussion of attention\nand consciousness, see Montemayor & Haladjian 2015). How then can\nwe gather the required evidence to assess competing theories?\n",
