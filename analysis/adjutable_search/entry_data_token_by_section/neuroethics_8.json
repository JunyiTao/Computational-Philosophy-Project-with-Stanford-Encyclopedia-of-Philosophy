Many of the\nethical questions are not new, but some have novel aspects. Bioethics\nalso has traditionally been concerned with issues of respect for\npatient\u2019s autonomy and right to self-determination. As mentioned\nabove, these questions take on added weight when the organ at issue is\nthe patient\u2019s brain, and questions about competence arise.\n\nEthical issues also attend doing neuroscientific research on\nnonhumans. Like traditional bioethics, neuroethics must address\nquestions about the ethical use of animals for experimental purposes\nin neuroscience. In addition, however, it ought to consider questions\nregarding the use of animals as model systems for understanding the\nhuman brain and human cognition (Johnson et al., 2020). Animal studies\nhave given us the bulk of our understanding of neural physiology and\nanatomy and have provided significant insight into function of\nconserved biological capacities. However, the further we push into\nunknown territory about higher cognitive functions, the more we will\nhave to attend to the specifics of similarities and differences\nbetween humans and other species and evaluating the model system may\ninvolve considerable philosophical work. In some cases, the\ndissimilarities may not warrant animal experiments.\n\nOther issues to which neuroethics also must be attentive to involve\nsocial justice. As neuroscience promises to offer treatments and\nenhancements, it must attend to issues of distributive justice, and\nplay a role in ensuring that the fruits of neuroscientific research do\nnot go only to those who enjoy the best our society has to offer.\nMoreover, a growing understanding that poverty and socioeconomic\nstatus more generally have long-lasting cognitive effects raises moral\nquestions about the social policy and the structure of our society,\nand the growing gap between rich and poor (Farah, 2017). It seems that\nthe social and neuroscientific realities may reveal the American Dream\nto be largely hollow, and these findings may undercut some popular\npolitical ideologies. There are also global issues to consider (Stein\nand Singh, 2020).\u00a0Justice may demand more involvement of\nneuroethicists in policy decisions.\n\nFinally, neuroethics stretches seamlessly into the law (see, e.g.\nVincent, 2013; Morse and Roskies, 2013; Jones et al., 2014).\nNeuroethical issues arise in criminal law, in particular with the\nissue of criminal responsibility (see, e.g. Birks & Douglas,\n2018). For example, the recognition that a large percentage of prison\ninmates have some history of head trauma or other abnormality raises\nthe question of where to draw the line between the bad and the mad.\nNeuroethics has bearing on issues of addiction and juvenile\nresponsibility, as well as on some other areas of law, such as in tort\nlaw, employment law, and health care law.\n",
