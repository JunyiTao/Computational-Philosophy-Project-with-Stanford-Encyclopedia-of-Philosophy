The logic system given by this consequence\nrelation is called the global consequence of \\(\\Lambda\\) and\nwill be denoted by \\(\\bgLambda\\). It has the same theorems as the\nlocal \\(\\blLambda\\), namely the elements of \\(\\Lambda\\). The\ndifference between \\(\\blLambda\\) and \\(\\bgLambda\\) lies in the\nconsequences they allow to draw from nonempty sets of premises. For example we have \n\\(p \\vdash_{\\bgK} \\Box p\\)  but \\(p \\not\\vdash_{\\blK} \\Box p\\).  This\ndifference has an enormous effect on their algebraic behavior.\n\nFor more information on modal logic, see the entry on\n modal logic.\n The reader can find specific information on modal logics as\nconsequence relations in Kracht 2006.\n",
