    "main_text": "Indirect, Theoretical Arguments || The Analogy to Theoretical Reason\n2.2 The Analogy to Theoretical Reason\n\n\nExternalists often appeal to the parallels between practical reasons\n(reasons for action) and epistemic or theoretical\nreasons (or reasons for belief) to make their case against\ncertain forms of internalism, particularly the Humean Theory of Reasons\n(Millgram 1996). They seem to be different species of the same\ngenus: while practical reasons are facts that support or justify\ncertain actions, theoretical reasons are facts that support or justify\ncertain beliefs. Both sorts of reasons are subsumable under the\nclass of normative reasons, or facts that support certain\nbehaviors.\n\n\nBut externalists object that it is implausible that reasons for\nbelief entail or depend upon facts about desire or motivation.\nRational belief is responsive only to evidence, and\nbeliefs formed on the basis of desires (like a husband\u2019s wishful\nbelief\u2014in the face of all the evidence\u2014that his wife is not\ncheating on him) are irrational. So not all\nnormative reasons are internal reasons. Internalism about\npractical reasons might therefore seem arbitrary and\nunmotivated. Once we\u2019ve allowed external reasons that count in\nfavor of believing certain things, why not allow external reasons that\ncount in favor of doing certain things? Elijah Millgram (1996) suggests that\njust as new experiences can reveal to us hitherto unknown reasons for\nbelief, so too new experiences (involving unexpected pleasures) can\nreveal to us reasons for action independent of our antecedent desires\nand dispositions.\n\n\nInternalists have two options here. They can deny that genuine\nreasons for belief can be external, extending their internalism to\ntheoretical reasons, or they can seek to motivate differential\ntreatment of the practical and the theoretical cases. To pursue\nthe former course, internalists might argue that we ascribe reasons for\nbelief on the assumption of a desire for knowledge or truth (see Kelly\n2003 for discussion). They can further argue that a person is\nsimply not in the business of forming beliefs if he does not\nhave something resembling a desire for truth (Velleman 2000).\nAlternatively, internalists might argue that we ascribe reasons for\nbelief on the assumption that whatever the contents of a person\u2019s\ndesire-set, it will include some item that would be served by believing\nthat for which there is evidence.\n\n\nThe second strategy would involve identifying a relevant difference\nbetween practical and theoretical reasons to explain why internalism\nis true of reasons for action, but not of reasons for belief.  For\nexample, Markovits (2011) argues that the practical case is different\nbecause there is no analogue to the plausible case\nof foundational beliefs in the epistemic case. A different\nstrategy might focus on differences in the nature or aims of\naction and belief. Suppose for example that\nwhile believing by its nature aims at tracking the truth, acting by its\nnature aims at satisfying some desire of the agent. We could then\nreasonably maintain that practical but not theoretical reasons can only\nbe internal.\n",
