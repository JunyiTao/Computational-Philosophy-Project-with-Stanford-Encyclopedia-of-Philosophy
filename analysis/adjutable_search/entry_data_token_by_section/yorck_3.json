    "main_text": "Philosophical Fragments on History and Psychology || Psychology of Life\n3.1 Psychology of Life\n\nAccording to Yorck, life is divided and articulated in itself, namely\nas an ongoing process of self-differentiation relative to others and\nthe environment. Yorck writes:\n\n\nThe primary and exclusive datum is self-consciousness, which, although\ndivided [dirimiert] into self and other, soul and lived body\n[Leib], I and world, inner and outer, is nonetheless,\npolarity [Gegens\u00e4tzlichkeit] and articulateness\n[Gegliedertheit] in one. But self-consciousness experiences\nitself in the play and counter-play of its constitutive factors, that\nis, as something alive [ein Lebendiges]. This aliveness is\nthe basic constitution. (ST, p. 8)\n\n\nBut there is no way that this aliveness can ever be grasped in its\npurity outside the fundamental differentiation. The antithetical\ndivision in \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d is so\nfundamental that one cannot go back behind it.\n\n\nThe separation [Trennung] of self and other, I and world,\nsoul and lived body [Leib] is such an early separation,\nindeed, the first act of life, as it were, such that these derivatives\nappear as absolute, autonomous, and self-sufficient. (ST, pp.\n11/12)\n\n\nYorck concludes: \u201cThe self is only through the other, just as\nthe other is only through the self\u201d (ST, p. 11).\n\nYet \u201clife\u201d remains the primary datum for Yorck.\nReminiscent of German Idealism, particularly Hegel and H\u00f6lderlin,\nYorck understands life as \u201cdifferentiated unity\u201d\n[differenzierte Einheitlichkeit] (ST, p. 38). Life explicates\nitself in form of an inner division and polarity. Each stance of life\nis a particular configuration of life\u2019s original division\n[Urtheil or Urtheilung] (ST, p. 25). Yorck\nwrites:\n\n\nObservation shows that primary life manifests a double diremption into\n[1] polarity [Gegens\u00e4tzlichkeit] and [2] difference\n[Verschiedenheit], such that the character of polarity\npermeates and determines the elements of the articulation. (ST, p.\n10)\n\n\nLife articulates or expresses itself differently in\nthree \u201cfunctions\u201d or \u201ccomportments\u201d\n[Verhaltungen], as life is lived in [1] \u201cfeeling\u201d\n[Empfinden] or affectivity, [2] \u201cwilling\u201d\n[Wollen], and [3] \u201ccognizing\u201d\n[Vorstellen] (ST, 32). Life is divided between the\ntwo antithetical or opposite poles of spontaneity and dependence (ST,\np. 9), which, applied to the different comportments or functions of\nlife, yields [1] the tension between motivation and spontaneity in\nvolition, [2] the opposition in cognition between objective,\nmatter-of-fact representation [Sachlichkeit] and spontaneous\nprojection of formed images [Bildlichkeit] as the object of\nknowledge, and [3] the polarity between dependence on others versus\nownness [Eigenheit] in the domain of affectivity (ST, p.\n32).\n\nYorck claims that the three psychological \u201cfunctions\u201d or\ncomportments circumscribe the fixed and unalterable \u201cnatural\nground\u201d [Naturboden], or the parameters within which\nall human history is played out (ST, p. 26). There is no history\nwithout such fixed reference points. The economy of the three\nfunctions is not fixed (unlike the functions as such), but is always\nopen to the play of shifting configurations and imbalances (ST, p. 24\n& 54). More specifically, the three functions are neither\nreducible to each other nor derivable from another source, making them\nin effect equiprimordial. However, they stand in a variable and\ninverse relationship to each other, where the relative preponderance\nof one function is offset by the relative subordination of the\nremaining ones, but at no time can any particular function be\ncancelled out altogether (ST, p. 98). This inverse relationship,\ncoupled with the internal polarity within each function, accounts for\n\u201cthe restlessness of primary life\u201d (ST, p. 32). Since life\ndoes not exist in some generality, but only as a particular\nconfiguration or alignment of its functions, the overall\n\u201ctotality\u201d of the shape of a particular life is always\ndetermined by a pre-dominant position of one of its functions (ST, p.\n55). This onesidedness, which necessarily fails to express life in its\n\u201centire\n fullness\u201d[10]\n (ST, p. 54), results in the instability of each particular shape of\nconsciousness. Each real configuration of consciousness and its\nparticular bias to one function, as well as one of the antithetical\npoles within, lends itself to a new transformation, without ever\nreaching a stable or final state. Since \u201chistorical life\u201d\nis nothing other than \u201cprimary life\u201d writ large, Yorck\nholds that this inbuilt instability and restlessness in primary life\nalso constitutes the \u201cmotor of history\u201d (ST, 33). (See\n Section 3.2\n below.)\n\nYorck holds that two functions of life, willing and cognition, are\n\u201ceccentric;\u201d they pursue objects that are projected\noutside the felt interiority of self-consciousness (ST, p. 120).\nConcerning representation or cognition, Yorck writes:\n\n\nSelf-reflection reveals representation [Vorstellen] as an act\nof exteriorization, as a projection, which therefore is primarily\nmarked by its opposition to feeling. The feature of projection,\n[i.e.,] expulsion from within [innere Entfernen], being the\ncharacteristic element of all representation, is spatialization\n[Verra\u00fcmlichung] as such. (ST, p. 70)\n\n\nSpatialization is thus necessary for representation or the work of the\nunderstanding, thought. By contrast, temporality (located in\naffectivity) is not at all necessary for cognition or\nrepresentation:\n\n\nThought can abstract from temporality. Indeed, every act of thought\ncontains [\u2026] an abstraction from [temporality], inasmuch as\nthought involves an expropriation [of inner feeling]. By contrast,\nspatiality is the precondition of all\n thought.[11]\n (ST, p. 147)\n\n\nAll thought is inherently spatial, representing objects at a distance\nin space: \u201cSpatiality is the basic character of all\nthought\u201d (ST, p. 119). According to Yorck, thought or cognition\nmay abstract from particular characters of space, such as\n\u201cdirection\u201d and \u201cplace,\u201d but it cannot do\nwithout the projective opening of spatiality as such (ST, p. 100). And\nYorck suggests that it is the inherent spatiality in all thought\nwhich, within the intellectualist tradition of the West, has rendered\n\u201cspace\u201d an unsurpassable \u201cmetaphysical\u201d\nreality, or transcendental condition of reality as such (ST, p. 100).\nSince thought or cognition is an achievement of life in abstraction\nfrom temporality and feeling, space itself appears as eternal, neutral\nexteriority.\n\nYorck emphasizes that cognition of objects in space amounts to an act\nof \u201cliberation,\u201d because what has been\n\u201cplaced\u201d at a \u201cpsychological distance\u201d in the\nrealm of an eternal, and neutral objectivity has lost its power over\nthe representing subject, has no impact on the person\u2019s\naffectivity, and can no longer excite the feeling that everything\npasses away (ST, p. 74).\n\nThere is thus a positive correlation between cognition and volition.\nCognitive projection is already an attempt to gain a foothold relative\nto \u201cthe flight of impressions, appearances, and\nstrivings,\u201d and the fixation of an object in space goes hand in\nhand with the search for self-constancy and\n\u201cself-affirmation\u201d [Selbstbehauptung] (ST, p.\n66). Therefore, Yorck holds that philosophy and science, as cognitive\ncomportments in life, are rooted in the striving for self-affirmation.\nHe thus attributes an eminent ethical impetus to them.\n\u201cFreedom\u201d and \u201cautonomy\u201d are the psychological\nmotivation for philosophy and science (ST, p. 42).\n\nIn contrast to cognition and volition, which are\n\u201ceccentric\u201d and directed towards the \u201couter,\u201d\nfeeling or affectivity [Gef\u00fchl or Empfindung]\nis the awareness of inwardness or interiority. Yorck writes:\n\u201cThe essence of the inner [des Innen] is feeling\n[Empfindung]\u201d (ST, p. 71). At the limit, feeling is\nobject-less and an immersion in subjective life. As Yorck explains,\nfeelings are only secondarily attached to objects. Pain or pleasure,\nfor instance, has no \u201crepresentational content\u201d\n[Vorstellungsinhalt]. Yorck writes: When \u201cI feel, I\nstay within me\u201d (ST, 71)\u2014chez moi, bei\nmir. Feeling is only minimally projective. However, since\npolarity permeates all psychological functions, Yorck is quick to\nrecognize \u201ca relation\u201d to the other, for there is no\n\u201cinner\u201d without an\n \u201couter.\u201d[12]\n But the centre of feeling or affectivity is the sphere of one\u2019s\nown, pure interiority, not as representation, but as something felt.\nTherefore, it is the actual seat of \u201call things personal\u201d\n[alles Pers\u00f6nliche], the innermost centre of personal\nlife (ST, p. 85). It is the \u201ccentral\u201d and immediate pulse\nof life, antecedent to the objectifications by cognition and volition\n(ST, p. 14). Yorck writes: \u201cThe relation of self to feeling is\nmore immediate\u201d than the subject\u2019s relation to\nrepresentation (ST, p. 99). Since the personal is something\nfelt in the interiority of one\u2019s life, and not\nsomething thought or represented and projected outwards,\nYorck concludes that self-relation is not cognitive in the first\nplace; it is not \u201cknowledge\u201d (ST, p. 72). Therefore, Yorck\nalso finds it a misguided effort \u201cto grasp natural and\nhistorical communities by means of representation,\u201d because it\nmisses the felt personal attachment, which alone lends reality to the\nhistorical connectivity and relation (ST, p. 72). Already in the\nCorrespondence, Yorck had stated that \u201chistorical\nreality is a reality of feeling\n[Empfindungsrealit\u00e4t]\u201d (CR, p. 113).\n\nNext, Yorck also claims that \u201ctime originates in feeling\u201d\n(ST, p. 135). But as feeling is non-projective, it follows that,\noriginally, \u201ctemporality\u201d is not\n \u201cobjective\u201d[13]\n (ST, 146). Yorck distinguishes between the feeling of transitoriness,\ni.e., that everything passes away\n[Verg\u00e4nglichkeitsgef\u00fchl] (ST, p. 33), and the\nfeeling or awareness of one\u2019s own mortality\n [Sterblichkeitsgef\u00fchl][14]\n (ST, p. 90). Acquiescence into one\u2019s own mortality constitutes\nthe opposite pole to self-affirmation: \u201cself-renunciation\u201d\n[Selbsthingabe] (ST, p. 14), which is thus distinct from and\neven antithetical to the ethical impetus in philosophy and science.\nYorck argues that the inversion of volitional and cognitive projection\nin feeling and its concentration in pure, passive interiority amounts\nto a \u201creligious comportment\u201d and the feeling of dependency\n(ST, 121). To the extent that the religious concentration of life in\ninteriority is inversely related to projective representation, Yorck\nunderstands religious life in terms of its \u201cfreedom from the\nworld\u201d or Weltfreiheit (ST, p. 81 & 112).\nPsychologically, freedom from the world is the precondition for the\nconsciousness of a world-transcendent God, or the consciousness of\ntranscendence (ST, p. 105). Yorck only hints at the projection sui\ngeneris involved in transcendence. But it is a projection that\nhas no cognitive or volitional content: God is intended without\nbecoming \u201can object,\u201d and willing becomes a\n\u201cnon-willing,\u201d albeit without loss of energy (ST,\n104).\n\nDrawing on Dilthey and Schleiermacher, Yorck argues that the immediate\nand indubitable reality of life is exclusively\n\u201cguaranteed\u201d through volition and affectivity alone. Yorck\nwrites: \u201cThat which opposes me or that which I feel, I call\nreal,\u201d because I cannot doubt what resists my will or affects my\npersonal life, whereas it is always possible to doubt objects\nneutrally represented in space outside me (ST, p. 89). What is thought\nand grasped as an unchanging, stable and self-same object in the space\nof thought does not affect me or solicit a desire. For Yorck,\ncognition, in abstraction from feeling and volition, is the realm of\npure \u201cphenomenality,\u201d which is always open to doubt in\nvirtue of its being merely represented or thought (ST, p. 88). Because\n\u201cthe category of reality is a predicate of feeling and\nwilling\u201d alone (ST, p. 128), Yorck concludes that it is an\n\u201cutterly uncritical\u201d and self-contradictory undertaking to\nattempt to prove \u201cthe reality of the world\u201d by means of\nthe understanding (ST, p. 129). What Yorck writes to Dilthey in a more\ngeneral vein is also applicable to this particular problem:\n\n\nThinking moves in circles and the people appear to me like flies which\nalways bump into the window pane when they try to get out into the\nopen. Someone has got to open the window, but much work and leisure is\nrequired for\n that.[15]\n\n",
