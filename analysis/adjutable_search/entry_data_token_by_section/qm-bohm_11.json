    "main_text": "Contextuality\n12. Contextuality\n\nThe\n Kochen-Specker Theorem,\n the earlier theorem of Gleason (Gleason 1957 and Bell 1966), and\nother no-hidden-variables results, including Bell\u2019s inequality\n(Bell 1964), show that any hidden-variables formulation of quantum\nmechanics must be contextual. It must violate the\nnoncontextuality assumption \u201cthat measurement of an observable\nmust yield the same value independently of what other measurements may\nbe made simultaneously\u201d (1964, reprinted 1987c: 9). To many\nphysicists and philosophers of science contextuality seems too great a\nprice to pay for the rather modest benefits\u2014largely\npsychological, so they would say\u2014that hidden variables provide.\n\n\nEven many Bohmians suggest that contextuality departs significantly\nfrom classical principles. For example, Bohm and Hiley write that \n\n\nThe context dependence of results of measurements is a further\nindication of how our interpretation does not imply a simple return to\nthe basic principles of classical physics. (1993: 100)\n\n\nHowever, to understand contextuality in Bohmian mechanics almost\nnothing needs to be explained. Consider an operator \\(A\\) that\ncommutes with operators \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) (which however don\u2019t\ncommute with each other). What is often called the \u201cresult for\n\\(A\\)\u201d in an experiment for \u201cmeasuring \\(A\\) together with\n\\(B\\)\u201d usually disagrees with the \u201cresult for \\(A\\)\u201d\nin an experiment for \u201cmeasuring \\(A\\) together with\n\\(C\\)\u201d. This is because these experiments differ and different\nexperiments usually have different results. The misleading reference\nto measurement, which suggests that a pre-existing value of \\(A\\) is\nbeing revealed, makes contextuality seem more than it is.\n\nSeen properly, contextuality amounts to little more than the rather\nunremarkable observation that results of experiments should depend\nupon how they are performed, even when the experiments are associated\nwith the same operator in the manner alluded to\n above.\n David Albert (1992: 153) has given a particularly simple and striking\nexample of this dependence for Stern-Gerlach experiments\n\u201cmeasuring\u201d the \\(z\\)-component of spin. Reversing the\npolarity in a magnet for \u201cmeasuring\u201d the \\(z\\)-component\nof spin while keeping the same geometry yields another magnet for\n\u201cmeasuring\u201d the \\(z\\)-component of spin. The use of one or\nthe other of these two magnets will often lead to opposite conclusions\nabout the \u201cvalue of the \\(z\\)-component of spin\u201d prior to\nthe \u201cmeasurement\u201d (for the same initial value of the\nposition of the particle).\n\nAs Bell insists:\n\n\nA final moral concerns terminology. Why did such serious people take\nso seriously axioms which now seem so arbitrary? I suspect that they\nwere misled by the pernicious misuse of the word\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d in contemporary theory. This word very\nstrongly suggests the ascertaining of some preexisting property of\nsome thing, any instrument involved playing a purely passive role.\nQuantum experiments are just not like that, as we learned especially\nfrom Bohr. The results have to be regarded as the joint product of\n\u201csystem\u201d and \u201capparatus\u201d, the complete\nexperimental set-up. But the misuse of the word\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d makes it easy to forget this and then to\nexpect that the \u201cresults of measurements\u201d should obey some\nsimple logic in which the apparatus is not mentioned. The resulting\ndifficulties soon show that any such logic is not ordinary logic. It\nis my impression that the whole vast subject of \u201cQuantum\nLogic\u201d has arisen in this way from the misuse of a word. I am\nconvinced that the word \u201cmeasurement\u201d has now been so\nabused that the field would be significantly advanced by banning its\nuse altogether, in favour for example of the word\n\u201cexperiment\u201d.
