    "main_text": "The importance of language and the presentation of logics\n3. The importance of language and the presentation of logics\n\nSuppose that two given logics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\)\nare to be combined using some technique. It should be obvious that any\nmethod applied to combine \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) will\ncreate a new logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) which contains the\nsignature (logic symbols such as connectives, quantifiers,\npropositional variables etc.) of both logics: \\({{\\cal L}}\\)\nwill be defined in a mixed language, which allows combinations of\nsymbols of the underlying languages. That is, a combination of logic\nsystems presupposes the previous combination of the respective\nsignatures. This is why the choice of the signature of the combined\nsystem is as important as the logic itself. For instance, the\ndefinition of the language of parameterization is fundamental in order\nto obtain the intended combined logic (see\n subsection 4.5).\n Another example is found in Schurz 1991, where the formal treatment\nof Hume\u2019s \u2018is-ought problem\u2019 (recall\n section 1)\n presupposes careful handling of subtle combinations of languages.\n\nBesides the definition of the appropriate language for the combined\nlogic, another important question that immediately arises is: should\nthe logics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) (to be combined) be\npresented in the same way? In other words: is it possible to combine\nlogics defined by different paradigms? For instance, how could one\ncombine a logic \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\), defined by a sequent calculus, with\na logic \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), represented by a (Hilbert-style) axiomatic\nsystem? How should the resulting logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) be represented:\nas a sequent calculus, as an axiomatic system or as a mixed proof\nsystem? Consider now another (even worse) situation: the logic\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) is described by semantical means (that is, through\nsemantic structures such as valuations or Kripke models) whereas the\nlogic \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) is presented through a syntactical proof\nsystem, such as a natural deduction system, sequent calculus or a\nHilbert-style axiomatization. Could the resulting (combined) logic be\nbetter presented semantically or syntactically?\n\nThis annoyance does not occur in the majority of cases, where the\nlogics being combined are complete with respect to some kind of\nsemantics and are syntactically presented in a homogeneous way.\nHowever, it may happen that the logics are found in peculiar ways; for\ninstance, linear logic and other substructural logics have no usual\nconsequence relations because derivations are exclusively displayed by\nusing multisets or sequences of formulas. Combinations of such logics\nwith usual modal logics, for instance, are not so obvious, although\nboth are complete.\n\nStill, there are logics which are only reasonably presented by\nsyntactical means, or exclusively by semantical means. Such is the\ncase, e.g., of the first-order theory of torsion groups, known to be\nnon-axiomatizable, and of incomplete modal logics which are only\npresented in syntactical (proof-theoretical) terms.\n\nA possible solution to the problem of combining heterogeneous logics,\nwhich naturally leads us to the deeper question of \u201cwhat is a\nlogic?\u201d, is to consider a common component of the majority of\nlogics (but still excluding certain substructural logics): their\nrespective consequence relations. Thus, given \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and\n\\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) presented in different ways, it is always possible to\nextract the respective consequence relations and then combine them\n(taking, for instance, their supremum in an appropriate lattice of\nconsequence relations). But in this way, the resulting logic \\({{\\cal\nL}}\\) is presented in a very abstract way: the only information\navailable from \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is its consequence relation, and so the\ncharacteristics and particularities of each logic component are\ndefinitively lost.\n\nReturning to the first example (combining a sequent calculus with an\naxiomatic system), a better solution was proposed in Cruz-Filipe et\nal. 2008: the idea is to define an abstract formalism for proof\nsystems, general enough as to encode the main proof mechanisms found\nin the literature. Thus, after reformulating \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and\n\\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) as abstract proof systems of this kind, the resulting\ncombined logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is an abstract proof system in which it\nis possible to recognize the \u2018genetic traces\u2019 of the\noriginal inference rules of each component within derivations in\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\). The latter question, namely, how to characterize\nderivations in a fibred logic in terms of the derivations of the\ncomponents, was carefully analyzed by S. Marcelino et al. in\na series of papers Marcelino et al. 2015; Marcelino and Caleiro \n2016; and Marcelino and Caleiro 2017a.  See\n subsection 4.3.\n\nDespite the above mentioned results on combining heterogeneous logics,\nit seems more reasonable to combine logics defined in a homogeneous\nway, and, in fact, this is the case with most of the proposals in the\nliterature. For instance, the usual combinations of modal logics (as\nfusion, product and fibring) are performed between systems presented\naxiomatically, or between classes of Kripke models. It is frequent,\ntherefore, to define different categories of logic systems\n(consequence relations, Hilbert calculi, algebraizable logics etc.)\nwith appropriate morphisms between them, in which the combination (or\ndecomposition) of logics appear as universal constructions. Algebraic\nfibring, to be described in\n subsection 4.3,\n is a good example of this approach.\n",
