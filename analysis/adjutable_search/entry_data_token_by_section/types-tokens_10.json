    "main_text": "What is a Token?\n6. What is a Token?\n\n\nIt might seem that tokens are less problematic than types, being\nspatio-temporal particulars. But certain complications should be\nnoted.  (We continue to use linguistic examples, but the remarks hold\ntrue for tokens generally).\n\nAs Kaplan (1990, p. 97) pointed out, a token of a word could be\nsuitably circumscribed empty space (e.g., in a piece of cardboard\nafter letters have been cut out of it).\nIt would seem that a token might also be a mental\nparticular\u2014because a poem might be composed prior to its being\nread or written down\u2014although there is disagreement over whether\nsuch a mental particular is to count as a token.\nIt will generally be the case that some tokens of the type\nresemble in their outward physical appearance some other tokens of the\ntype, but as we saw in \u00a74-5, it is generally not the case that\nall the tokens of the same type resemble one another in\nappearance. (Recall the example of the letter \u2018A\u2019 in\n\u00a74.)\nEven being similar in appearance (say by sound or spelling) to a\ncanonical exemplar token of the type is not enough to make a physical\nobject/event a token of that type. The phonetic sequence [Ah\n\u2018key ess \u2018oon ah \u2018may sah] is the same phonetic\n(type) spoken in Spanish or Yiddish. Yet if a Spanish speaker uses it\nto say a table goes here, she has not, in addition, said\na cow eats without a knife in Yiddish. She has not said\nanything in Yiddish, however phonetically similar what she said might\nbe to a sentence token of Yiddish. So her token is a token in Spanish,\nnot Yiddish. Meaningful tokens are tokens in a language.\nAlong the same lines, being a physical object/event that is\nsimilar in appearance (say by sound or spelling) to a canonical\nexemplar token of the type is not even enough to make the physical\nobject/event meaningful, because, as Putnam (1981, pp. 1-2)\namong others has argued, the token must have been appropriately\nintentionally produced.\nIf it is not already clear from the foregoing, it should be noted\nthat a physical object that is a token of a type is not one\nintrinsically\u2014merely by being a certain sequence of\nshaped ink marks, say. Just as being a brother is not an intrinsic\nproperty of brothers because one is a brother only relative to another\nperson, so a token is a token only relative to a type, and to a\nlanguage, perhaps to an orientation, and perhaps, as Hugly and Sayward\n(1981 p. 186) have argued, to a tokening system (e.g., Morse Code),\nwhich they define as \u201ca set of instructions that tell how, for\nany given expression, a speaker of the language could construct a\nperceptible particular that tokens that expression given that the\nspeaker had enough physical and mental resources\u2026\u201d. \n",
