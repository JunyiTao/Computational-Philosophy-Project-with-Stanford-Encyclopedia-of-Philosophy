    "main_text": "Belief change and Dynamic Epistemic Logic || Static and dynamic belief change\n4.2 Static and dynamic belief change\n\nThe literature on belief change in Dynamic Epistemic Logic makes an\nimportant distinction between \u201cstatic\u201d and\n\u201cdynamic\u201d belief change (van Ditmarsch 2005; Baltag and\nSmets 2008b; van Benthem 2007). \n\n Static belief change: the objects of agent\nbelief are fixed external truths that do not change, though the\nagent\u2019s beliefs about these truths may change. In a motto,\nstatic belief change involves \u201cchanging beliefs about an\nunchanging situation\u201d. \nDynamic belief change: the objects of agent\nbelief include not only external truths but also the beliefs\nthemselves, and part or all of these can change. In a motto, dynamic\nbelief change involves \u201cchanging beliefs about a\nchanging situation that itself includes these very\nbeliefs\u201d. \n\n\nTo better explain and illustrate the difference, let us consider the\nresult of a belief change brought about by the Moore formula \n\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\\taglabel{MF}\np\\land\\lnot[a]p,\n\\end{equation*}\\]\n\n\ninformally read, \u201cp is true but agent a does not\nbelieve it\u201d. Let us suppose that this formula is true; that is,\np is true and, indeed, agent a does not believe that\np is true. Now suppose that agent a receives the formula\n\\eqref{MF} from a completely trustworthy source and is supposed to\nchange her beliefs to take into account the information this formula\nprovides. In a dynamic belief change, she will accept the formula\n\\eqref{MF} and hence, in particular, she will come to believe that\np is true. But then the formula \\eqref{MF} becomes false: she\nnow believes p and therefore the formula \\(\\lnot[a]p\\)\n(\u201cagent a does not believe p\u201d) is false. So\nwe see that this belief change is indeed dynamic: in revising her\nbeliefs based on the incoming true formula \\eqref{MF}, the truth of\nthe formula \\eqref{MF} was itself changed. That is, the\n\u201csituation\u201d, which involves the truth of p and the\nagent\u2019s beliefs about this truth, changed as per the belief\nchange brought about by the agent learning that \\eqref{MF} is true.\n(As an aside, this example shows that for dynamic belief\nchange, the AGM Success postulate is violated and so must be dropped.)\n\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, it is also possible to undergo a static\nbelief change upon receipt of the true formula \\eqref{MF} from a\ncompletely trustworthy source. For this to happen, we must think of\nthe \u201csituation\u201d with regard to the truth of p and\nthe agent\u2019s beliefs about this truth as completely static, like\na \u201csnapshot in time\u201d. We then look at how the\nagent\u2019s beliefs about that static snapshot might change upon\nreceipt of the completely trustworthy information that \\eqref{MF} was\ntrue in the moment of that snapshot. To make sense of this, it might\nbe helpful to think of it this way: the agent learns something in\nthe present about what was true of her situation in the\npast. So her present views about her past beliefs change, but the\npast beliefs remain fixed. It is as though the agent studies a\nphotograph of herself from the past: her \u201cpresent self\u201d\nchanges her beliefs about that \u201cpast self\u201d pictured in the\nphotograph, fixed forever in time. In a certain respect, the\n\u201cpast self\u201d might as well be a different person: \n\n\nNow that I have been told \\eqref{MF} is true at the moment pictured in\nthe photograph, what can I say about the situation in the picture and\nabout the person in that situation? \n\n\nSo to perform a static belief change upon receipt of the\nincoming formula F, the agent is to change her present belief\nbased on the information that F was true in the state of\naffairs that existed before she was told about F.\nAccordingly, in performing a static belief change upon receipt of\n\\eqref{MF}, the agent will come to accept that, just before she was\ntold \\eqref{MF}, the letter p was true but she did not believe\nthat p was true. But most importantly, this will not cause her\nto believe that \\eqref{MF} is true afterward: she is only\nchanging her beliefs about what was true in the past; she has\nnot been provided with information that bears on the present. In\nparticular, while she will change her belief about the truth of\np in the moment that existed just before she was informed of\n\\eqref{MF}, she will leave her present belief about p as it is\n(i.e., she still will not know that p is true). Therefore, upon\nstatic belief revision by \\eqref{MF}, it is still the case that\n\\eqref{MF} is true! (As an aside, this shows that for static\nbelief change, the AGM Success postulate is satisfied.) \n\nStatic belief change occurs in everyday life when we receive\ninformation about something that can quickly change, so that the\ninformation can become \u201cstale\u201d (i.e., incorrect) just\nafter we receive it. This happens, for example, with our knowledge of\nthe price of a high-volume, high-volatility stock during trading\nhours: if we check the price and then look away for the rest of the\nday, we only know the price at the given moment in the past and cannot\nguarantee that the price remains the same, even right after we checked\nit. Therefore, we only know the price of the stock in the\npast\u2014not in the present\u2014even though for practical reasons\nwe sometimes operate under the fiction that the price remains constant\nafter we checked it and therefore speak as though we know it (even\nthough we really do not). \n\nDynamic belief change is more common in everyday life. It happens\nwhenever we receive information whose truth cannot rapidly become\n\u201cstale\u201d: we are given the information and this information\nbears directly on our present situation. \n\nWe note that the distinction between static and dynamic belief change\nmay raise a dilemma that bears on the problem of skepticism in\nEpistemology (see, e.g., entry on\n Epistemology):\n our \u201cdynamic belief change skeptic\u201d might claim that\nall belief changes must be static because we cannot really\nknow that then information we have received has not become stale. To\nthe authors\u2019 knowledge, this topic has not yet been explored.\n\n",
