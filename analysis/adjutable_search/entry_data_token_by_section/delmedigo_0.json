    "main_text": "Life of Elijah Del Medigo\n1. Life of Elijah Del Medigo\n\nElijah Del Medigo was born in Candia (nowadays Heraklion), in the\nisland of Crete, in 1458 or shortly before that. Crete being a\nVenetian colony, Del Medigo traveled to Venice around 1480. The\nreasons for this move cannot be determined with certainty; one\nsuggestion is that Del Medigo moved to Padua in order to study\nmedicine (Cassuto 1918: 222; Ross 1984: 18). However and whatever were\nhis initial motives, Del Medigo\u2019s activity while in Italy\nconcentrated around the instruction of philosophy and the composition\nof philosophical works. More specifically, during his long stay in the\nItalian peninsula Del Medigo earned his fame as translator of and\ncommentator on works by Averroes, and as the author of original\ntreatises aimed at clarifying Averroes\u2019 doctrines in various\nfields. The target audience of these works were leading Christian\nfigures within the intellectual circles of Padua and Venice, among\nthem Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Domenico Grimani. During the\nacademic year 1480/81 Del Medigo composed his Quaestio de primo\nmotore and Quaestio de efficientia mundi following a\npublic discussion in Padua, which led scholars to speculate that Del\nMedigo held an official role in that university (Montada 2013: 165).\nIt seems however that while Del Medigo did play a major role in the\nintellectual life in the Veneto in that period, he was not officially\naffiliated with the university of Padua. Around 1482 Del Medigo moved\nto Venice, returned again to Padua, and in the years 1484\u201385\nstayed with Pico della Mirandola in Florence. During the academic year\n1485/86 we find Del Medigo again in Padua (Ross 1984: 20), and it is\naround that time he composed his commentary on the De substantia\norbis. Del Medigo then continued to travel throughout the cities\nof Northern Italy, spending some time in Venice in 1488 under the\npatronage of Domenico Grimani. During his Italian sojourn Del Medigo\ncomposed four original works, wrote two commentaries on works by\nAverroes, and translated about nine works by Averroes from Hebrew into\nLatin.\n\nAt around 1490 Del Medigo returned to Crete. As is often the case with\ndetails concerning Del Medigo\u2019s life, the reasons for his return\nare not entirely clear. According to Ross, Del Medigo experienced\ngeneral discomfort with a growing intellectual trend of the Italian\nRenaissance, oriented more towards Neoplatonic and Kabbalistic\ntendencies than towards the rationalist speculation of the\nAristotelian schools of the Middle Ages (see Ross 1984: 24\u201325).\nBe it as it may, it was following his return to Crete and during the\nlast years of his life that Del Medigo composed what would become his\nmost famous work, Be\u1e25inat ha-Dat, which will be\ndiscussed in detail below. Del Medigo died in Candia around 1492/1493\n(Ross 1984: 21\u201322; Licata 2013a: 48),\n\nA common trait of Del Medigo\u2019s literary output is a clear taste\nfor Aristotelian philosophy in its Averroist guise. This is manifested\nboth in his translations and commentaries on Averroes, as well as in\nthe Be\u1e25inat ha-Dat (although Averroes\u2019 name is\nnot mentioned in that work, for reasons which will be discussed\nbelow). Despite this overarching feature, Del Medigo\u2019s\noeuvre is also characterized by a dichotomy, geographical in\nas much as it is linguistic, religious and intellectual: Crete vs.\nItaly, Jewish thought vs. Paduan Aristotelianism, Hebrew vs. Latin. We\nwill examine Del Medigo\u2019s activity as cohesive whole yet in\nlight of these different backgrounds and circumstances.\n",
