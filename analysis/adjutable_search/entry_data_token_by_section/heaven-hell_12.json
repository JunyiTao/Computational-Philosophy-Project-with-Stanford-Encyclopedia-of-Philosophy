    "main_text": "Heaven: Three Critical Issues\n5. Heaven: Three Critical Issues\n\nRarely, if ever, are Christian theologians very specific about what\nheaven will supposedly be like, and there are no doubt good reasons\nfor this. For most of them would deny that the primary sources of the\nChristian faith, such as the Bible, provide much information on this\nparticular matter. But three issues have typically arisen in the\nrelevant philosophical literature: first, because so many of the\nrecent Christian philosophers have focused upon free will theodicies\nof hell, it is hardly surprising that the issue of freedom in heaven\nshould likewise have arisen; a second issue is whether the misery of\nloved ones in hell would undermine the blessedness of those in heaven;\nand a third issue is whether immortality of any kind would ultimately\nlead to tedium, boredom, and an insipid life.\n",
