    "main_text": "The Primacy of the Aesthetic\n1. The Primacy of the Aesthetic\n\nOne common concern strikingly unifies otherwise different romantic\ncontributions. Early and late, German, British and French, the\nromantics advocated what may legitimately be called \u201cthe primacy\nof the aesthetic\u201d. In romanticism, the\n\u201caesthetic\u201d\u2014most broadly that which concerns beauty\nand art\u2014is not just one aspect of human life or one branch of\nthe humanistic studies. Rather, if the romantic ideal is to\nmaterialize, aesthetics should permeate and shape human life.\nFriedrich Schlegel, one of the leading figures in Early German\nRomanticism, put this idea in a few memorable phrases: \u201cThe\nRomantic imperative demands [that] all nature and science should\nbecome art [and] art should become nature and science\u201d (FLP:\n#586); \u201cpoetry and philosophy should be united\u201d (CF:\n#115), and \u201clife and society [should be made] poetic\u201d (AF:\n#16).\n\nSchlegel is not alone on this matter. Similar sentiments and slogans\nhad been expressed just a little earlier in what is commonly regarded\nas the manifesto of German romanticism, The Oldest Programme:\n\n\n\nThe idea that unites everyone [is] the idea of\nbeauty\u2026I am now convinced that the highest act of\nreason, by encompassing all ideas, is an aesthetic act, and that\ntruth and goodness are siblings only in beauty.\n(H\u00f6lderlin, in Bernstein 2003:  186).[3]\n\n\nThe British romantics have taken up and developed this view that the\naesthetic is the foundation of knowledge and the pursuit of truth.\n\u201c\u2018Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\u2019\u2014that is\nall//Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\u201d, Keats famously\ndeclared in the Ode on a Grecian Urn ([1820] lines 49\u201350,\nPJK). And in the Preface to Coleridge and Wordsworth's Lyrical\nBallads (1800), we read, \u201cPoetry is the first and last of\nall knowledge\u2014it is as immortal as the heart of man\u201d\n(paragraph 20, in PWWW, I, p. 141).\n\nHow is this core feature of romantic aesthetics, the primacy of the\naesthetic, to be explained?\n\nA textually grounded and philosophically viable way to approach the\nimperative is as a structural or formal demand. On that reading, the\nimperative requires that we model our epistemological,\nmetaphysical, ethical, political, social and scientific pursuits\naccording to the form of the aesthetic comportment to the world,\nexemplified in poetry. On such an approach, rather than aiming to\nreplace \u201creal\u201d life, science and philosophy with\npoetry, the romantics urge human beings to fashion their ordinary\nlives and to do science and philosophy according to the model provided\nby poetry. Philosophy, science and everyday life need not be\npoetry, but poetic or poetry-like.\nStructurally, they should become similar. Why so? The main\ntask of this entry is to offer an answer to this question and to show\nthat the reasons for \u201cpoeticizing\u201d life, science and\nphilosophy are philosophical.\n",
