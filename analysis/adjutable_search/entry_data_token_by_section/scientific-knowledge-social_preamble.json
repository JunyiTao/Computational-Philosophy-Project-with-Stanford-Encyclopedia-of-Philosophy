    "main_text": "\n\nStudy of the social dimensions of scientific knowledge encompasses the\neffects of scientific research on human life and social relations, the\neffects of social relations and values on scientific research, and the\nsocial aspects of inquiry itself. Several factors have combined to\nmake these questions salient to contemporary philosophy of science.\nThese factors include the emergence of social movements, like\nenvironmentalism and feminism, critical of mainstream science;\nconcerns about the social effects of science-based technologies;\nepistemological questions made salient by big science; new trends in\nthe history of science, especially the move away from internalist\nhistoriography; anti-normative approaches in the sociology of science;\nturns in philosophy to naturalism and pragmatism. This entry reviews\nthe historical background to current research in this area and\nfeatures of contemporary science that invite philosophical attention.\n\nThe philosophical work can roughly be classified into two camps. One\nacknowledges that scientific inquiry is in fact carried out in social\nsettings and asks whether and how standard epistemology must be\nsupplemented to address this feature. The other treats sociality as a\nfundamental aspect of knowledge and asks how standard epistemology\nmust be modified or reformed from this broadly social perspective.\nConcerns in the supplementing approach include such matters as trust\nand accountability raised by multiple authorship, the division of\ncognitive labor, the reliability of peer review, the challenges of\nprivately funded science, as well as concerns arising from the role of\nscientific research in society. The reformist approach highlights the\nchallenge to normative philosophy from social, cultural, and feminist\nstudies of science while seeking to develop philosophical models of\nthe social character of scientific knowledge and inquiry. It treats\nthe questions of the division of cognitive labor, expertise and\nauthority, the interactions of science and society, etc., from the\nperspective of philosophical models of the irreducibly social\ncharacter of scientific knowledge. Philosophers employ both formal\nmodeling techniques and conceptual analysis in their efforts to\nidentify and analyze epistemologically relevant social aspects of\nscience.\n",
