    "main_text": "Distributive Justice\n5. Distributive Justice\n\nSu\u00e1rez's highly original discussion of distributive justice has\nbeen unjustly neglected. Its originality resides in the rejection of\nsome of the main principles of the Aristotelian conception of\ndistributive justice that significantly shaped the modern conception,\nincluding that of, for instance, John Rawls. Among these were the\nprinciples that distributive justice operates only when total funds\nare insufficient to meet some ideal or desired standard and that a\njust distribution is a just division and so presupposes a\ndivisible good and multiple recipients.\n\nHis fundamental break with Aristotelianism, however, resulted from his\nrejection of the view that distributive justice distinctly aims at\nproportional allocation. For Su\u00e1rez, the types of justice\nshould be distinguished by the type of right which they oversee rather\nthan by the ideal distributional pattern at which they should aim.\nDistributive justice oversees a right to the thing, rather\nthan a right in the thing (a ius ad rem rather than a ius\nin rem). The ius ad rem was usefully defined by Austin\nas \u201ca right of compelling you to pass me a right in\nrem\u201d (Austin, 1869: 993). Unlike infringements of iura\nin rem, those of iura ad rem do not call for\nrestitution. For example, if in a competition for public office, the\nbest candidate is not chosen, he has an actionable claim against the\nappointment committee, but he cannot say that he has been deprived of\nsomething that was his.\n\nFor Su\u00e1rez, in order to have a distributive justice claim it is\nnot enough to exhibit the quality that in principle entitles you to a\nshare. He provides this illustration: if someone works in your\nvineyard without your knowledge or consent, this does not mean that\nyou owe him wages. Distributive justice requires a background pact\nbetween the owner of the common stock (the community) and its members.\nThis pact defines the criteria that allow members to have actionable\nclaims to the receipt of a share of the common stock.\n\nAlthough this pact creates rights, the rights have pre-positive\nfoundations. In order to ground a debt to a reward an action must be\nof a value commensurate to the reward. Not all posited conditions\nindebt the promisor as a matter of justice, but only those that\ncorrespond to a pre-contractual fittingness or commensurability\nbetween the reward and the action or personal quality.\n\nDistributive justice, insofar as it is the sovereign's justice,\ngoverns also the enjoyment of property rights. The sovereign (in the\npolitical case, the community or its appointee) retains a form of\nsuperior ownership (which he terms \u201csupreme dominium\u201d)\nover private possessions (Disputatio de Iustitia 1.12, in\nSu\u00e1rez, Opera omnia XI). This means that the sovereign\ncan withdraw your property rights, say over your car, and transfer\nthem to someone else (say, to be used for security patrols). You could\nlodge a complaint that your private ownership of the car was more\nconducive to social utility (say, because you are a doctor). By\nlodging this complaint, however, you would not be claiming a violation\nof your property rights (as in the case of theft), but rather, of your\nright to property rights under agreed, public criteria\nregulating their allocation.\n",
