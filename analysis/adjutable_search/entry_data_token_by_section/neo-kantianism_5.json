    "main_text": "The Southwest School\n3. The Southwest School\n\nThe beginning of the Southwest School of Neo-Kantianism can arguably\nbe located in Wilhelm Windelband\u2019s 1883 essay, \u201cCritical\nor Genetic Method?\u201d, which for the first time both gives a clear\nexposition of the philosophical point of view that would characterize\nthe Southwest school and argues explicitly for a return to Kant.\nHowever, many of the core ideas in that essay were already articulated\nby Windelband\u2019s teacher, Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881),\nprincipally in his Logic (1874). Lotze argued for a clean\ndistinction between philosophy and psychology. Logic depends on the\ndistinction between \u201ctruth and untruth\u201d, and gives the\nlaws that thought ought to obey, while psychology identifies\nthe laws that mental processes do obey. Logic gives laws\ngoverning the content of thoughts, while psychology concerns\nacts of thinking (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332; on the\nact/content distinction see also Lotze 1856\u201364: vol.2, 630;\nLotze 1874: \u00a7337). The contents of thoughts are objective,\ninasmuch as they are not only shareable but have a reality independent\nof being thought. Though these contents are real, they do not occur\n(as events do), do not exist or have being (as things do), but are\nvalid (1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318). Though Lotze did not\nexplicitly call for a return to Kant, he did articulate many of the\nthemes that the SW Neo-Kantians located in Kant. Lotze argued that\nknowing cannot be considered a copying [Abbilden] of\nits object (\u00a7327); he held that knowledge requires a priori\nelements, and that apriority is not the same as innateness\n(\u00a7324); and more generally he positioned his philosophy as a\nmiddle ground between speculative idealism and materialism.\n\nAfter completing his dissertation, on the doctrine of chance, under\nLotze in 1870, Windelband (1848\u20131915), moved to Strassburg in\n1882, and then to Heidelberg in 1902. A master essayist, he is best\nknown for the essays and addresses collected in his\nPr\u00e4ludien (1915), which was first published in 1883. In\n\u201cCritical or Genetic Method?\u201d\u2014the important essay\njust mentioned\u2014Windelband self-consciously looks to Kant and the\ncritical philosophy as the key to clearly distinguishing philosophy\nfrom psychology. Picking up Lotze\u2019s key notion of validity, he\nargues that Kant\u2019s project is best understood as a study of\nvalidity: the topic of philosophy is value, or the \u201cvalidity of\naxioms\u201d or norms. This study of validity should be broadened to\nall areas of culture. This broadening of the critical project was\ncarried further in his essay, \u201cHistory and Natural\nScience\u201d (1894), which argued (against the positivist theory of\nhistory), that history provides a distinct way of knowing (which he\ncalls, \u201cidiographic\u201d), distinct from the natural\nscientific (\u201cnomothetic\u201d) way of knowing. Windelband was\nalso a prolific and original historian of philosophy, culminating in\n1891 with his history of philosophy from ancient to modern times\n(Windelband 1891). He articulated and defended a conception of doing\nhistory of philosophy (Problemgeschichte, history of\nphilosophical problems) that became standard for the Neo-Kantians of\nboth schools.\n\nThese programmatic ideas in the theory of knowledge and the philosophy\nof history were expanded systematically by Windelband\u2019s student\nHeinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936). After writing his dissertation\n(\u201cThe Theory of Definition\u201d) under Windelband in\nStrassburg in 1888, Rickert moved to Freiburg in 1889. The\nphilosophical school became known as the Southwest or Baden school,\nbecause Freiburg and Heidelberg are both in Baden in southwest\nGermany. In 1892, he published The Object of Knowledge\n(Rickert 1915), which he expanded and modified in subsequent editions\nover the next thirty years. His most influential book, The Limits\nof Concept Formation in Natural Science (1st ed: 1902) greatly\nexpands and systematically develops the core idea in\nWindelband\u2019s essay \u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d.\nHis book Das Eine, die Einheit und die Eins (Oneness,\nUnity, and the Number One, 1911), was one of the few SW works in\nthe philosophy of mathematics.\n\nAmong the students of Rickert and Windelband who aligned themselves\nwith their philosophical point of view, the most influential and\nphilosophically sophisticated was Emil Lask\n (1875\u20131915).[16]\n After studying under Windelband in Heidelberg and Rickert in\nFrieburg, Lask wrote his dissertation under Rickert in 1902\n(\u201cFichte\u2019s Idealism and History\u201d). He later habilitated at\nHeidelberg, where Windelband was located, and eventually became a\nprofessor there. While there, he wrote two dense works, The Logic\nof Philosophy and the Doctrine of the Categories (1911), and\nThe Doctrine of Judgment (1912). Tragically, he died in 1915\nin the Great War.\n",
