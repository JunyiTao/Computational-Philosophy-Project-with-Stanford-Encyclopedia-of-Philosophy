    "main_text": "Atomism in Classical Indian Philosophy || Buddhist atomist theories\n1.2 Buddhist atomist theories\n\nDeveloped in the centuries after the Buddha (6th c. BCE), Buddhist\nphilosophies, especially the Abhidhamma school, systematized the\nunderlying philosophy of a body of texts that focused on human lived\nexperience. The entities in Buddhist theory that are considered\natomistic are not substances but momentary events, dharmas or\ndhammas: \u2018the constituents of sentient experience, the\nirreducible \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d that make up one\u2019s\nworld\u2019 (Ronkin 2005, 41). These atomic particulars can be mental\nor physical, and have been compared to trope theories or process\nmetaphysics in contemporary scholarship. Unlike theories of atomic\nsubstances, Buddhist atoms are not composed of multiple properties. In\ncontrast to Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomists, Buddhists deny\nthat there is an underlying substance uniting different properties\nlike the colour and the weight of a jar (Bhaduri 1947). Atomic\nproperty-instances do not occur in isolation, any more than nouns and\nverbs made sense alone.\n\nDespite the phenomenological character that atoms sometimes bear in\nBuddhist thought, questions about compositionality occur which\nparallel issues in other ancient atomist theories (Goodman 2004,\nCarpenter 2021). Vai\u015be\u1e63ika thought\u2014which accepted\ncategories like substance and soul\u2014impacted the articulation of\nAbhidhamma ontology, an articulation that sometimes led to charges of\n\u2018ontologization,\u2019 i.e. of moving away from the\nexperiential focus of Buddhist thought towards a more systematic\nmetaphysics (Ronkin 2005). Material atoms are first found in Buddhist\nthought in the work of Dharmasri (2nd c. CE), and feature in the work\nof Vasubandhu and Sanghabhadra (both 5th c. CE) (Ronkin 2005, 56).\n\nBuddhist versions of atomism differ from\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika versions on the status of the wholes\ncomposed of atoms, with the former treating composites as mere\naggregates, the latter regarding them as distinct entities in their\nown right (Sarkar 2021). The Buddhist emphasis on the transitory\nnature of material reality was part of the motivation for their\ninterest in atomist explanations (Gangopadhyaya 1980, 52; Ronkin 2005,\n59). In the enumeration of different kinds of mental states, notions\nthat correspond to materiality are included, although earth, water,\nwind and fire are typically considered to be merely mental constructs\nin Buddhist thought.\n\nAtoms were nonetheless used in materialist explanations, which account\nfor physical phenomena such as the combination of different elements\nto form macroscopic materials. Because we appear to see visible\nparticles of dust, or rays of light shining on glass or mirrors, it\nseemed reasonable to suppose that interactions too small to perceive\nproduce observed changes in the macroscopic world (Dasgupta 1987).\nHeat and light were thought to be produced by minute corpuscles\nentering other bodies. Buddhist atomism regarded atomic properties\nsuch as solidity, heat and motion as producing perceptible changes at\nthe macroscopic level (Gangopadhyaya 1980, 13\u201314). Even with\nnon-material atoms, the question of their occupation of space was\nconsidered: Matilal suggests that tangibility may have been regarded\nas a latent property of the atoms, which emerges like visibility when\nthey cluster (Matilal 1986, 361). Different Buddhist schools disagreed\non the answer to these questions.\n\nProblems about the possibility of motion, developed especially by the\nBuddhist N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (2nd c. CE), prompted responses in other\nschools of thought (Matilal 1977, 79; Dasgupta 1987). Although the\npersistence of macroscopic bodies might be illusory, there were\ndiscussions about the momentum or persisting tendencies of moving\nbodies, the different directions exhibited by these tendencies in a\nrotating wheel, and the cohesion of particles within moving\nbodies.\n",
