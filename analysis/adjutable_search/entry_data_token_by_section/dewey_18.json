But it was also responding\nto dialectic within philosophy\u2019s epistemological positions,\nparticularly the tension between British empiricism, rationalism (see\nentry on\n rationalism vs. empiricism),\n and the Kantian synthesis. A brief account will suffice to introduce\nDewey\u2019s response.\n\nClassical empiricists insisted that the origins of knowledge lay in\nsensory experience. They were motivated, in part, by the concern that\nrationalistic accounts, seeking to trace knowledge to thought alone\n(rather than particular, independent sense stimuli), were too\nunchecked. Without the limits imposed by sense experience, philosophy\nwould continue to produce wild and divergent dogmatisms. There was in\nclassical empiricism, as in Dewey, a genuine interest in scientific\nprogress; for science to advance, it needed to escape unfettered\nspeculation. The account developed, then, by figures such as Locke,\nBerkeley, and Hume claimed that (in Locke\u2019s version) the world\nwrites on a receptive blank slate, the mind, in the language of ideas.\nBy the faculties of memory, association, and imagination, knowledge is\ngenerated; further elaborations of what is known must, on the\nempiricists\u2019 account, be checkable against its origins in sense\nexperience.\n\nRationalists, in contrast, argued that knowledge was by nature both\nabstract and deductively certain. Consider, for a moment, your sensory\nexperiences: they are fluid, individualized, and permeated by the\nrelativity borne of innumerable external conditions. How could a\nphilosophical account of genuine knowledge\u2014necessarily\ncertain, self-evident, and unchanging\u2014be derived using a method\nso besotted with sensorial flux? Knowledge must derive, rather, from\ninner concepts, which could be certain. Knowledge, then, is produced\nby an immaterial entity, mind, with a power to reason which is innate,\nand which stands logically independent of practical ends and the\ncontingencies of one\u2019s physical body.\n\nKant responded to the empiricist-rationalist tension by reigning in\ntheir overweening ambitions; he argued that philosophy must stop\nattempting to transcend the limits of thought and experience.\nPhilosophy\u2019s proper aspiration is more modest\u2014to discover\nwhat is possible to know in the phenomenal world. Kant, then, refused\nan originary role to either percepts or concepts, arguing instead that\nsense and reason are co-constitutive of knowledge. More important,\nKant argued that what epistemology requires is an account of the mind\nas a systematic and constructive force.\n\nDewey\u2019s response to this three-way epistemological conflict was\nforeshadowed in the earlier discussion of the \u201cReflex Arc\u201d\npaper, with its account of natural constituent of the sensori-motor\ncircuit. Any proposal premised on a disconnected mind and\nbody\u2014or upon one assuming that stimuli (be they causes or\nimpressions or whatever) were atomic and in need of\nsynthesis\u2014was a non-starter for\n Dewey.[26]\n\nWhile he accepted some of Kant\u2019s criticisms of rationalism and\nempiricism, he rejected Kant\u2019s propagation of several\nsignificant but unjustified assumptions. Chief among these assumptions\nwas the idea that knowledge must be certain; that nature and intellect\nwere categorically distinct; and that a noumenal realm\n(things-in-themselves) was a justified posit. In addition, Dewey\nquestioned Kant\u2019s claim that the sensations which supply\nknowledge are inchoate, initially\u2014this claim being merely\nanother posit driven by Kant\u2019s architectonic. Methodologically,\nand perhaps more significantly, Dewey followed James in criticizing\nKant\u2019s overall standpoint as, still, too spectatorial. From the\npragmatic, Jamesean, \u201cradical empiricist\u201d standpoint, one\nmay accept as real (though not necessarily as known) a variety of\nphenomenon, whether such are clear, vague, felt, remembered,\nanticipated, etc.\n\nThus, for Dewey, Kant cannot achieve the philosophical perspective\nnecessary for a dynamic synthesis of perception and conception, nature\nand reason, practice and theory. While Kant\u2019s model of an active\nand structuring mind was a clear advance over more passive systems, it\nmaintained the retrograde depiction of knowledge as faithful mirror of\nreality. The missing insight was knowledge as dynamic\ninstrument, consisting in managing (predicting, controlling,\nguiding) future experience. Within this framework,\ndetermining \u201cknowledge\u201d is akin to judging the value of an\neye or hand; one asks how they affect the organism\u2019s ability to\ncope: \n\n\nWhat measures [knowledge\u2019s] value, its correctness and truth, is\nthe degree of its availability for conducting to a successful issue\nthe activities of living beings. (\u201cThe Bearings of Pragmatism\nUpon Education\u201d, in MW4: 180) \n\n\nThus, Dewey replaced Kant\u2019s mind-centered system with one\ncentered upon experience-nature transactions\u2014\u201ca\nreversal\u201d, Dewey wrote, \u201ccomparable to a Copernican\nrevolution\u201d (QC, LW4: 232).\n",
