    "main_text": "Ren\u00e9 Descartes || Roots of the distinction\n3.1 Roots of the distinction\n\nDescartes formulates no distinction of P/SQs but familiar doctrines to\nwhich he is committed point to one. He maintains that his mechanist\ntheory of matter and motion can explain everything in the corporeal\nworld (CSM 1.285; AT\n 8.323).[2]\n He holds that bodies and minds are substances each of which can exist\nindependently of the other (CSM 2.54; AT 7.78). According to him,\nknowledge of continuous extension, and the sizes, figures, positions,\nand local motions of its parts, is innate in the human intellect, or\nmind (CSM 2.44; AT 7.63). By contrast, we know SQs only with aid of\nthe body (CSM 1.217; AT 8.33\u20134). The Cartesian P/SQ distinction\nimplicit in these doctrines has three roots:\n\nthe theory of ideas which is central to Descartes\u2019\nepistemology and psychology,\nthe unity of a finite substance in general,\nthe composite unity of a human being. Brief explanations\nfollow.\n\n3.1.1 Ideas\n\nIn Meditations an idea is said to be a mental act that is\n\u201clike an image\u201d (CSM 2.25; AT 7.37). Most scholars take\nthis to mean that ideas are presentational and intentional: we are\nacquainted with them and they direct thought to something else (M.\nWilson 1978: 102\u2013103; 1992: 69\u201383;). To apprehend anything\nat all (actual or possible) is to have an idea of it (CSM\n2.2.25\u201326; AT 7.37). Meditations explicates\nintentionality in terms of objective being: the idea of the sun is the\nsun \u201cexisting in the intellect in the way its objects are\nnormally there\u201d (CSM 2.75 and 27\u20138; AT 7.103 and 40; CSM\n1.198, note 1). As Descartes also puts it, ideas represent things\n(e.g., CSM 2.28; AT 7.40): an idea represents an object that is\nF just in case it represents the object as F (CSM\n2.145\u20136, 163; AT 7.207, 234). The representation may be sensory\nor intellectual (CSM 2.126, 127\u20138; AT 7.179, 181): its cognitive\nvalue may range from clear and distinct to confused or obscure (e.g.,\nCSM 2.29\u201330; AT 7.43; CSM 1.207, 317; AT 8.22\u20133,\n33\u201334).\n3.1.2 The substance-quality (mode) relation\n\nDescartes argues, in general: if a particular quality or affection\nexists, it must subsist or reside in a substance that makes it exist\n(CSM 2.114; AT 7.61; CSM 1.210; AT 8.25). The substance must have the\ncapacity to enable this particular quality to exist and any other\nquality in a range in which this one is included (CSM 2.124; AT 7.76)\nThe range is determined by its principal attribute, or essence: all\nqualities (or modes) of a substance are referred to its essence and\nunintelligible without it (CSM 1.210; AT 7.25; CSM 2.54; AT 7.78). So\nthe essence of a substance and all the qualities that do or can exist\nin it have reciprocal relations of conceptual dependence (Bolton 2013:\n65\u20136). Scholars characterize the relation in several\nways\u2014as that between an occult quality and its known effects\n(Malebranche 1674\u201375 [1980: 622]), the atomic structure of gold\nand its sensible and laboratory properties (Rozemond 1998: 92; Beck\n1965: 118\u201322), an absolute and its limits (Downing 2011:\n122\u201325). But Secada (2000: 190\u201394) cites a letter in which\nDescartes speaks of the relation as an instance of the more general\nrelation between two concrete things one of which is determined by the\nother (To Mersenne for Hobbes, 21 April 1641, CSM 3.178\u20139; AT\n3.355) Secada (also Bolton 2013) concludes the relation should be\nunderstood as that between a highest order determinable and its\ndeterminates.\n3.1.3 The union of mind and body\n\nIn addition to unities of nature (substances), Descartes recognizes\n\u201cunities of composition\u201d, for instance, the flesh and\nbones of the same animal-machine (CSM 2.285, 157; AT 7.423, 222).\nOther examples are a mouse, a human body and a human being. Such\nthings are ens per se: although they have parts that can\nexist outside them, the parts are then regarded as incomplete. So the\nmind/body unity is robust enough to tag a mind separated from its body\nas incomplete (To Regius, December 1641; CSM 3.200; AT 3.461). Brown\nand Normore (2019: 52\u201360) contend that things with this status\nhave a nature of the type Descartes calls \u201ctrue and\nimmutable\u201d (hereafter \u201cTIN\u201d). Anything with a TIN\nhas ground in reality indicated by its being the subject of\ndemonstrable truths; corporeal nature, geometrical entities and God\nare mentioned in Meditation 5 (CSM 2.44\u20135; AT\n7.63\u20135) and it is said to be true of Cartesian animals\n(Conversation with Burman, 16 April 1648; CSM 3.143\u20134; AT\n5.160). The bi-conditional test for things with a TIN is having a\nproperty that arises from the conjunction of all its ingredients (CSM\n2.84; AT 7.118; Brown & Normore 2019: 55\u201360). That is, the\ncomposite possesses some property that does not already belong to one\nof its parts, as in the case of Pegasus. For instance, a triangle\ninscribed in a square has a property the triangle does not have on its\nown, namely, having an area half that of the square that superscribes\nit (CSM 2.83\u20134; AT 7.117\u201318). Descartes maintains that the\nunion of mind and body has a TIN which would, if known, account for a\nhuman being\u2019s having appetites, emotions, and sensations of\ncolors, etc. (CSM 1.208\u20139; AT 8.23).\n",
