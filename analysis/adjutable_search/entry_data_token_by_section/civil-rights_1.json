    "main_text": "The Standard Idea\n2. The Standard Idea\n\nIn contemporary public discourse, the term \u2019civil rights\u2019\nis typically used to refer to a range of rights narrower than the full\nset of claims belonging to free and equal citizens. This usage\nreflects the now standard idea of civil rights as the rights that\nmembers of society have against discrimination on the basis of race,\nsex, ethnicity, disability, sexual preference, and other\ncharacteristics regarded as morally objectionable reasons for the\ndistribution of major social benefits and burdens. Discrimination, in\nturn, is understood as encompassing those actions, policies and\npractices that (wrongfully) disadvantage the members of certain\nsocially salient groups, on account of their group identity, relative\nto other members of society (cf. Lippert- Rasmussen 2014). \n\nChristopher Schmidt argues that the standard idea is a 20th century\ndevelopment, deviating from the concept of civil rights that prevailed\nin the decades following the Civil War. He notes that the earlier\nconcept referred to \u201cthe right to contract, own property, sue, testify\nin court, and the right to physical security,\u201d all of which were\nregarded as \u201cfundamental to citizenship\u201d (2021: 30 and 52). But\n\u201c[w]hen civil rights was [sic] reborn in the middle decades of the\ntwentieth century,\u201d a \u201cnovel\u201d concept emerged that \u201ccentered on a\nsweeping nondiscrimination principle rather than on a bounded\ncollection of fundamental rights\u201d (135).\n\nRobin West paints a similar historical picture, though her focus is on\nlegal doctrine rather than on the general public understanding. She\nwrites, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a civil right to much of anything, beyond\nthe right to nondiscrimination \u2026 under our contemporary\nconception of civil rights\u201d (2019: 74). West explains how the U.S.\nSupreme Court has been instrumental in the current dominance of this\nidea of civil rights, but she also points to the role that mainstream\nlegal scholarship has played. By contrast with this current idea,\naccording to the \u201cclassical understanding\u201d (29) held by 19th century\njurists, civil rights \u201cwere not simply rights \u2019not to be\ndiscriminated against\u2019 on the basis of impermissible\ncharacteristics,\u201d but also included \u201cunambiguously rights to\nsomething: . . . to protection and security, to enter and enforce\ncontracts, to own buy or sell property\u201d and other categorical claims\nessential to \u201cmembership in society\u201d (149\u201350 and 157, emphasis in\noriginal). As a progressive liberal who seeks to have legal doctrine\nrecognize substantive economic claims as rights of citizenship, West\naims to transcend the standard idea by subordinating it to an updated\nversion of the classical understanding.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, many radical activists calling for revolutionary\nchange have ignored any idea of civil rights broader than the standard\none. Accordingly, Angela Davis, who is among the most prominent of\nthose activists, explains that \u201cthe frame of civil rights\u201d\nis too small to understand the nature of the black freedom struggle in\nAmerica and beyond. The struggle \u201cwas not only a question of\nacquiring the formal rights to fully participate in society, but\nrather it was also about substantive rights \u2013 it was about jobs,\nfree education, free health care, affordable housing, and also about\nending the racist police occupation of Black communities\u201d (2016:\n72). So Davis follows the legal mainstream in declining to describe as\n\u201ccivil rights\u201d categorical claims to such goods as jobs, housing,\nhealth care and trustworthy policing. \n\nWest argues that the standard idea is inextricably connected to a\nconceptual error. Consider the right to protection from private\nviolence, which West characterizes as \u201cthe irreducible,\nminimal, and even quintessential civil right\u201d (2019: 66; emphasis in\noriginal). Each member of society has such a right, she contends, and,\nif the government fails to secure it for everyone, then the civil\nrights of all are violated, notwithstanding the fact that there would\nbe no discrimination involved in the failure (23). Accordingly, she\nholds that it is a conceptual mistake to \u201cconflate[ ] the idea of\nnondiscrimination with the idea of civil rights\u201d (18).\n\nAdditionally, West argues that the standard idea is tied to normative\nerrors, because it fails to affirm that members of society not only\nhave a right against being deprived of certain benefits for\ndiscriminatory reasons; they also have a categorical right to those\nbenefits. The result is that, given the standard idea, civil rights\nare rendered \u201chollow\u201d and \u201cformal,\u201d lacking\nsubstantive content because they do not mandate outcomes in the\ndistribution of benefits but only require that processes of\ndistribution be free of discrimination (46 and 48).\n\nFor West, the normative deficiency of the standard idea is on display\nin the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings regarding education and\nemployment. The court has ruled that there are constitutional rights\nagainst being denied an educational or employment opportunity on\ngrounds of race or sex but has failed to recognize any categorical\nconstitutional right to education or employment (204\u2013212). The court\nhas even failed to recognize a categorical civil right to police\nprotection. West regards those failures as reflections of the standard\nidea and its radically truncated conception of \u201cthe duty the state\ntakes on, when we enter a social compact\u201d (66).\n\nHowever, the standard idea is not conceptually or normatively\ndeficient in the ways that West claims it to be. The idea is\nconsistently conjoined with the recognition that, beyond\nantidiscrimination rights, free and equal citizenship requires rights\nto police protection, education, and other benefits that modern\nsociety can and should provide its members. If the Supreme Court is\nwrong in failing to recognize such claims as among the basic rights of\ncitizens, then the problem is not with the standard idea but rather\nwith the court\u2019s impoverished understanding of free and equal\ncitizenship. \n\nAdditionally, West\u2019s charge that the standard idea renders civil\nrights \u201chollow\u201d due to the merely \u201cformal\u201d character of\nantidiscrimination rights appears to unduly minimize the normative\nsignificance of claims against discrimination. Even though such claims\nare, in a sense, \u201cformal,\u201d claims that are formal can still be morally\nimportant. Davis acknowledges this point, writing that civil rights\nare \u201cimmensely important,\u201d even though she adds that \u201cfreedom is more\nexpansive than civil rights\u201d (2016: 72). \n\nThe normative significance of formal rights can be appreciated by\nconsidering the right to vote in a free and fair election. There is no\nguaranteed or predetermined outcome in such an election, and, to that\nextent, the right to vote is formal: it is a right to be part of a\nprocess, not a right to any particular outcome of the process. But the\nfranchise is not normatively \u201chollow\u201d; rather, it is a right that has\nhelped persons in a modern society to protect themselves from serious\ninjustice (sec. 4 below).\n",
