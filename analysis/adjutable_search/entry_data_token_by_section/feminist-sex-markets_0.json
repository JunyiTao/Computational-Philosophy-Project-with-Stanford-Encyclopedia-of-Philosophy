Pornography engages and\ntrains us to be sexually aroused at images depicting women as social\ninferiors, and thereby reinforces the \u201cmechanisms, norms, and\nmyths\u201d that sustain women\u2019s unequal social status (679).\nEaton acknowledges that not all pornography eroticizes inequality and\nfocuses her critique on \u201cinegalitarian pornography\u201d. She\nhypothesizes that the harms caused by exposure to inegalitarian\npornography range from increasing rates of sex discrimination, sexual\nharassment and assault to degrading the status of women. Eaton\nrecognizes that her causal model requires empirical support, and that\nthe studies needed to confirm or refute it have not yet been done.\nBecause inegalitarian pornography is not the only kind of mass culture\nthat promotes sexist attitudes and behavior, it can be difficult to\nseparate out the effects of sexist materials that are sexually graphic\nfrom those that are not.\n\nIn the early years of the second-wave feminist movement, activists\ncampaigned against all violent and sexist popular media. Carolyn\nBronstein argues that the shift from condemning violent and sexist\nmedia images to condemning only pornography (even nonviolent porn)\ninvolved two main factors. First, radical feminists began to view the\nproliferation of hardcore pornography as part of the wider backlash to\nadvances in women\u2019s equality. The saturation of society with\nPlayboy, Hustler, Deep Throat, adult bookstores, and eventually cable\ntelevision and video pornography in the 1960s and 1970s was\ninterpreted by some activists as an orchestrated campaign to keep\nwomen in their assigned social sphere. Some feminists accused their\nopponents of disseminating uniquely seductive and powerful misogynist\npropaganda that falsely and maliciously depicted women as desiring and\ndeserving of coercive and degrading sexual use. Second, Bronstein\nalleges that, by targeting pornography as the culprit rather than\nsexism in the media, the feminist anti-pornography movement took\nadvantage of the conservative climate of the 1980s. Religious social\nconservatives, in particular, had become increasingly critical of the\nsexual revolution of 1960s, and they saw the growth of the pornography\nindustry as evidence of their country\u2019s cultural shift. The\nconvergence of aims among feminists and some conservatives enabled the\nformer to garner financial support from non-feminist, and even\nanti-feminist organizations (Bronstein 2011: 322).\n\nThe anti-pornography movement\u2019s groundwork culminated in the\ndevelopment of a new approach for restricting pornography, which did\nnot rely on the government\u2019s censorship of obscene speech.\nCatharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin wrote a model anti-pornography\nordinance, which was soon adopted by the city of Indianapolis with the\nhelp of evangelical Christian organizations (Bronstein 2011: 324). The\nordinance defined pornography as the \u201csexually explicit\nsubordination of women, graphically depicted, through pictures and/or\nwords\u201d, and it allowed potential victims to bring civil lawsuits\nagainst the producers and distributors of materials with the specified\ncontent. In response, many free speech activists organized to\nchallenge this new law, and similar ones proposed in cities around the\ncountry. In 1986, the Supreme Court found the Indianapolis ordinance\nto be unconstitutional and, not long after, the feminist\nanti-pornography movement fell into disarray.\n\nAlthough the second-wave feminist anti-pornography movement has now\nevolved into the third-wave sex-positive feminist movement, a number\nof feminist academics are attempting to revive societal opposition to\npornography (Eaton 2007; Langton 2009; Hornsby 1995; Brison 1998). By\nutilizing the tools of philosophical analysis and empirical social\nscience, feminist academics aim to strengthen the intellectual\nfoundations of the anti-pornography movement. With a better\nunderstanding of the impact of pornography on individuals and society,\nand the psychological and social mechanisms that can explain its\ninfluence, communities can mobilize more effective responses to its\nproduction, distribution, and consumption. Now that the Internet\nenables pornography to reach wider audiences, its impact may be\ngreater than ever.\n\nHelen Longino was one of the first feminist philosophers to articulate\na theory of how pornography harms women. She argued that pornography\nshows men and women taking pleasure in activities that objectify women\nand treat women as less than human. By depicting female subjects as\ndehumanized objects, pornography promotes the idea that women can be\ntreated without moral regard (i.e., raped and subjugated). Longino\nwrites\n\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with pornography, then, is its degrading and\ndehumanizing portrayal of women, and not its sexual content.\nPornography, by its very nature, requires that women be subordinate to\nmen and mere instruments for the fulfillment of male fantasies\n(Longino 1980: 45)\n\n\nFollowing the philosopher Immanuel Kant, Longino assumes that sex is\nmorally problematic because it is difficult, if not impossible, to\nhave sex without treating another person as a \u201cmere means\u201d\nto our own satisfaction. Sexual desire is irrational and leads us to\nreduce others to their sexual body parts, and thus is objectifying,\ndehumanizing, and degrading. Longino adds a feminist element to Kant\nby arguing that, because men have greater social power than women, men\nare able to use women as instruments to satisfy their sexual ends.\nPornographic depictions of heterosexual sex, then, glorify and promote\nthe immoral and subordinating treatment of women by men.\n\nCatharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin\u2019s well known analysis of\npornography similarly incorporates a Kantian model of sexual morality\nwith a feminist spin (Shrage 2005). Heterosexual acts are inherently\nviolent to women in that they involve men treating women as\ninterchangeable objects whose integrity and boundaries are not\nrespected. Ordinary heterosexual acts, for Dworkin, involve men\ninvading and occupying women\u2019s bodies (Dworkin 1987).\nPornography, then, is equated with visual evidence and documentation\nof the abuse of particular women, and those who view it collaborate in\ntheir violation. According to MacKinnon, women in patriarchal\nsocieties are not free to refuse sex with men, and therefore their\nparticipation in sex with men is not fully consensual. Sex with\npersons incapable of giving genuine consent, made into a public\nspectacle via pornography, expands the temporal and spatial parameters\nof the crime. When women view pornography they often relive their own\nviolation and public humiliation. Therefore, pornography has the power\nto repeatedly traumatize women and does not merely record a past\nabuse, according to MacKinnon and Dworkin. Adult pornography is\nsimilar to child pornography, which records and amplifies the abuse of\nmolested children. Both allow others to participate in and exploit\nsomeone\u2019s victimization for sadistic pleasure. Moreover,\nMacKinnon contends that adult pornography is a tool that can be used\nto obtain a woman\u2019s cooperation with her abuser, just as child\npornography can with a child. She writes that pornography is used by\nmen \u201cto train women to sexual submission\u201d (MacKinnon 1987:\n188).\n\nMacKinnon also claims that \u201cspecific pornography does directly\ncause some assaults. Some rapes are performed by men with\npaperback books in their pockets\u201d (MacKinnon 1987: 184). And\nbecause \u201cpornography conditions male orgasm to female\nsubordination\u201d (MacKinnon 1987: 190), it indirectly and\nsubconsciously elicits from men controlling sexual behaviors.\nPornography shapes both female and male sexual desire into\nvictim/abuser roles, and represents predatory sexual behaviors as\nnatural forms of sexual and gender expression. Pornography is\ntherefore harmful to men who consume it, as well as to women who have\nsexual contact with men, on and off screen. In MacKinnon\u2019s\nwords, pornography represents\n\n\nsex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be\nforced on other real women; women\u2019s bodies trussed and maimed\nand raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed,\nand this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is\nvisible and the coercion that has become invisible\u2014this and more\nbothers feminists about pornography \u2026 pornography causes\nattitudes and behaviors of violence and discrimination that define the\ntreatment and status of half of the population. (MacKinnon 1987:\n147)\n\n\nFor these reasons, anti-pornography feminists generally hold that\npornography is not simply a sexist nuisance that can be addressed by\ncalls for consumer boycotts and corporate responsibility. Instead,\npornography \u201cnourishes sexism\u201d (Longino 1980: 54) and\ndisrespect for women in ways that eventuate in violations of\nwomen\u2019s basic moral and civil rights.\n\nLongino argues that pornography should not be given the same legal\nprotection as other expressive materials. Along with MacKinnon, she\nproposes that pornography should be restricted, not as a form of\nobscene expression, but as a product that can cause serious injuries\nto women, individually and as a group. Longino contends that liberal\ntoleration of pornography constitutes acceptance of the immoral\ntreatment of women (Longino 1980: 48). MacKinnon and Dworkin take this\nargument a step further and allege that pornography often records acts\nof criminal rape and, therefore, its dissemination further compounds\nthe injuries of such criminal acts (MacKinnon 1987: 128, 148\u201349;\nDworkin 1979: 201). Toleration for pornography disempowers all women\nbecause it perpetuates a climate in which women constantly feel\nthreatened by rape, which makes it impossible for them to exercise the\nformal rights they have won. MacKinnon and Dworkin\u2019s model\nordinance sought to make \u201cpornography actionable as a civil\nrights violation\u201d so that women would have legal recourse when\npornographic materials prevent the exercise of their rights or cause\npersonal injuries (MacKinnon 1993: 22, 121, n. 32). By protecting the\nspeech of pornographers and shielding them from liability, according\nto MacKinnon, the state fails to protect women\u2019s equality and\ncivil rights.\n\nMacKinnon and Dworkin offer only anecdotal empirical support for their\nclaims about the harmfulness of pornography. But their work inspired a\nnumber of social scientists to conduct controlled studies to find more\nempirical support for their claims. Reviewing the social science\nliterature available at the time, Diana Scully writes\n\n\nthe proliferation of cultural products, like pornography, intensifies\nthe quantity and quality of violence in men\u2019s fantasies.\nFurther, particularly when women are depicted as receiving pleasure\nfrom the violence directed at them, pornography trivializes rape and,\nthus, may encourage more men to act on their fantasies. Armed with the\nmyths celebrated in violent pornography, such as women secretly want\nto be raped, men who rape can and do believe that their behavior is\nwithin the normative boundaries of the culture. (Scully 1990: 155)\n\n\nScully\u2019s own research compares the consumption of pornographic\nmaterials by convicted rapists with a control group of felons.\nAlthough she notes some problems with her research design, she\nconcludes that her\n\n\ndata do establish that the majority of convicted rapists were familiar\nwith pornography and that their use of such material was somewhat\ngreater than that of other felons. (Scully 1990: 154)\n\n\nIn their review of pornography research, Neil Malamuth, Tamara\nAddison, and Mary Koss report that\n\n\nThe current findings do suggest that for the majority of American men,\npornography exposure (even at the highest levels assessed here) is not\nassociated with high levels of sexual aggression\u2026But among\nthose at the highest \u201cpredisposing\u201d risk level for sexual\naggression (a little above 7% of the entire sample), those who are\nvery frequent pornography users (about 12% of this high risk group)\nhave sexual aggression levels approximately four times higher than\ntheir counterparts who do not very frequently consume pornography.\n(Malamuth, Addison, and Koss 2000: 85)\n\n\nIn a more recent review of the social science literature, Christopher\nFerguson and Richard Hartley report that\n\n\nEvidence for a causal relationship between exposure to pornography and\nsexual aggression is slim and may, at certain times, have been\nexaggerated by politicians, pressure groups and some social\nscientists. Some of the debate has focused on violent pornography, but\nevidence of any negative effects is inconsistent, and violent\npornography is comparatively rare in the real world. Victimization\nrates for rape in the United States demonstrate an inverse\nrelationship between pornography consumption and rape rates. Data from\nother nations have suggested similar relationships. (Ferguson and\nHartley 2009)\n\n\nAlthough Ferguson and Hartley do not discuss studies that consider\nonly inegalitarian pornography, as Eaton\u2019s work suggests, they\ndiscuss a 2004 study that \u201cfound that pornography protects\nagainst negative attitudes toward women\u201d, and a 2007 study that\n\u201cfound no relationship between pornography consumption and\nnegative attitudes toward women\u201d. However, the 2004 study\nindicates, \u201cpornography consumers may be more prone to\nbenevolent sexism, which involves beliefs that women should be\nprotected from harm\u201d (2009: 326). Contrary to Longino and\nMacKinnon, pornography does not seem to \u201cnourish sexism\u201d\nin its malevolent forms.\n\nDeborah Cameron and Elizabeth Frazer question whether any accounts of\nthe causal properties of pornography are helpful or illuminating. They\nargue that such accounts assume a deterministic model of human\nbehavior, in which men lose control over their behavior and respond\nsomewhat mindlessly to pornographic stimuli (Cameron & Frazer\n2000: 248\u2013251). The idea that men simply imitate what they see\nin pornography, or are conditioned to behave in certain ways through\nexposure to pornography, implies that men are not able to creatively\nand critically interpret pornographic materials. Although some men may\nunthinkingly copy what they see, or may even become\n\u201caddicted\u201d to sexual violence through pornography, these\nmen are the exception, not the rule (Cameron & Frazer 2000: 243).\nBy treating sexual violence as a product of exposure to pornography,\nfeminists promote a view that relieves sexual predators of\nresponsibility for their actions, and blames their actions instead on\nexpressive materials or the pathological conditions they allegedly\ncause. Although causal theories invoking the loss of individual\ncontrol through \u201cimitation\u201d and \u201caddiction\u201d\nmay be useful to defendants in sexual assault and murder cases,\nCameron and Frazer point out that these theories undermine the\nfeminist goal of showing that sexual violence is a function of\ncultural norms and structural inequalities, rather than mental\ndebilitation or disease (Cameron & Frazer 2000: 248). Ironically,\ncausal models may engender social sympathy for the perpetrators of\nsexual violence and make it difficult to punish them (Cameron and\nFrazer 2000: 247). Cameron and Frazer conclude that feminists can be\ncritical of \u201cthe discourses which inform sexual practice\u201d\nand imagine alternative discourses, without promoting problematic\nmodels of human behavior (Cameron & Frazer 2000: 253).\n\nNot all feminist philosophers concur with the feminist critique of\npornography. While agreeing that the content of pornography condones\nthe objectionable treatment of women, Ann Garry was one of the first\nto question whether pornography should be held responsible for\npervasive gender-based violence and discrimination. Garry writes\n\n\nMuch of the research on the effects of pornography indicates that\nany effect it has\u2014positive or negative\u2014is short\nlived. (Garry 1978: 404)\n\n\nGarry also questions whether treating a woman as a sex object is\nalways bad, and suggests that pornography succeeds in harming women,\nin part, because viewers assume that sex is generally harmful to women\n(Garry 1979: 136\u201337; see also Garry 2001). Garry encourages\nfeminists to support the production of non-sexist pornography rather\nthan try to suppress pornographic materials.\n",
