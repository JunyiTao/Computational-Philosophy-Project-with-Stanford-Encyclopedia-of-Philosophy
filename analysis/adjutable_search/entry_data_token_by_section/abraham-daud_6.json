    "main_text": "Main Themes in ER || Soul\n5.2 Soul\n\n\nThe soul is an important and central issue in the ER, related\nas it is to Ibn Daud\u2019s treatment of the aforementioned\nkey-concepts of Aristotelian natural philosophy on the one hand, and\nto his discussions of cosmology, prophecy and ethics on the\nother. About one fifth of the book is devoted to an investigation of\nthe soul, its nature and faculties, its relation to the body and its\nafterlife (ER W 20\u201341; S 54b\u2013116b). Ibn Daud infers the\nexistence of something like the soul from the fact that different\nnatural bodies are characterized by various actions, which can only be\nexplained by positing the existence of an immaterial principle that is\nadded to their corporeality and from which these actions derive.\nFollowing Aristotle, Ibn Daud defines the soul as the perfection of a\nnatural organic body that possesses life potentially. Elaborating on\nthe distinction between soul and accident, he maintains that the soul\nis a substance (in the sense of form), refuting the view of the\n\u201cphysicians\u201d that it is a mixture, thereby dismissing all\nother theories according to which the soul is an accident. In\ncontradistinction to earlier Jewish philosophers of neo-Platonic\norientation, Ibn Daud emphasizes the unity of the soul.\n\n\nA key idea in Ibn Daud\u2019s detailed description of the various\nfunctions of the vegetative, animal and rational faculties is the\nnotion that there is a hierarchy of soul-faculties, in which the lower\nones serve the higher. The speculative faculty of the human soul\noccupies the highest position in this hierarchy. Thanks to this\nfaculty, which is directed towards the incorporeal world, man can\nperfect his knowledge and apprehend the incorporeal beings that are\ncalled angels in Scripture. It thus constitutes the link between man,\nangels and God. This faculty is served by the practical faculty, which\nis directed to the corporeal world, and governs man\u2019s conduct.\nAlthough the soul is dependent on the body during the first stages of\nthe acquisition of knowledge when the intellect passes from\npotentiality to actuality, it can exist separate from the body when it\nhas attained the stage of acquired intellect. The rational soul is,\ntherefore, immortal. According to Ibn Daud,\n\n \u2026 the ultimate purpose of the creation of bodies in the\nphysical world was that from the world of generation and corruption\nimmaterial immortal substances would be purified. Such a substance is\nthe human soul that is perfected by true knowledge and correct action\n(ER W 23\u201324; S 65b\u201366b).\n \n\n\nThe importance of Ibn Daud\u2019s psychology does not lie so much in its\ncontents (that are largely based on Ibn Sina\u2019s psychology), but\nprimarily in its detailed treatment and in the manner in which he\nemploys and adapts Ibn Sina\u2019s theories so as to accommodate his own\npurposes.  The premise that the human soul is an incorporeal\nsubstance is the key to the philosophers\u2019 promise that internalizing\nthe intellectual and eternal truths will grant eternal life. The\nquestion of immortality is a sophisticated conversion of a theological\nproblem into a philosophical argument regarding the eternity of truth\nand spiritual pleasures. It is based on Ibn Sina\u2019s discourse on this\nissue, and in many cases quotes him word for word.\n",
