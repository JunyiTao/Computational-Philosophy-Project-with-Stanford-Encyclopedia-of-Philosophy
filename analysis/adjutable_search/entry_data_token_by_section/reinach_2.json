    "main_text": "Investigations into the Material A priori\n3. Investigations into the Material A priori\n\n\nReinach notes in his Marburg lecture (1914) that, while many\nphilosophers had acknowledged the existence of a priori\ntruths, most had restricted the a priori to a very narrow\nsphere, confining it either to the formal a priori (Hume) or\nto the a priori of Newtonian physics (Kant). For Reinach, in\ncontrast, there are material a priori structures in every\ndomain of reality. If we know that only a free agent can be\nresponsible, then this is because we understand the necessary and\ntimeless natures of freedom and responsibility. In \u201cConcerning\nPhenomenology\u201d Reinach states that \u201cthe realm of the a\npriori is incalculably large \u2026 [and this] opens up for\ninvestigation an area so large and rich that still today we cannot see\nits boundaries\u201d (1914, pp. 215\u2013216). In defending the existence\nof material a priori truths (also called \u2018essential\nlaws\u2019), Reinach and his colleagues thus believed that they had\nestablished a new kind of research agenda for philosophy. And while in\nmany respects this is an agenda which combats reductionism, its\nproponents have at the same time provided us with several examples in\nwhich careful analysis of essences in the spirit of this agenda\nprecisely refutes the existence of certain supposed entities.\n",
