    "main_text": "Defining Culture || Culture-as-identity (or identity rather than culture)\n1.4 Culture-as-identity (or identity rather than culture)\n\nTo answer the challenge of how to identify a culture, and its members,\none proposal focuses on the subjective component associated with\nbelonging to a cultural group. Take this example, described by\nMargaret Moore: although there is deep division in Northern Ireland\nbetween Catholics and Protestants, the differences are neither\nreligious (the conflict is not about distinctive interpretations of a\nreligious text, and religious figures are not targeted for violence),\nnor cultural, since surveys of cultural values of both communities\nreveal considerable overlap among the values that competing\ncommunities hold (Moore 1999: 35). She says, rather, a focus on shared\nidentities among rival groups makes more sense of the conflict.\u00a0\nA largely or partly identity-focused view highlights that one key\ndimension of culture is the way in which it shapes the identity of\ncultural group members. As well, such a view highlights that culture\nis a thing to which many people will have important\nconnections,\u00a0but\u00a0which will be defining for them in multiple\nand distinct\u00a0ways. An identity-focused view has clear merits: for\nexample, it can explain why individuals remain nominally attached to a\nculture, even though its centrally defining features shift\nhistorically over time, and even if they do not engage with some of\nits more traditional aspects.\n\nAdditionally, an identity-focused view can accommodate identities that\nare not obviously culturally based, for example, including LGBTQ+\nidentities (Eisenberg 2009: 20; for a discussion of cultural/identity\nclaims in an LGBTQ+ context, see Ghosh 2018: chapter 4). Indeed, an\nidentity-focused view aims to circumvent the difficulty of identifying\nwhat specific material is legitimately cultural material. As noted\nabove, scholars of minority cultures\u00a0frequently note that there\nis a wide variety of claims made by a wide variety of groups, and\nthese groups are defined by an assortment of distinct characteristics,\nincluding race, ethnicity, religion and sexuality. Say its defenders,\na focus on identity rather than culture may be preferable because\n\n\nthe term identity covers more ground in the sense that it can refer to\nreligious, linguistic, gendered, Indigenous and other dimensions of\nself-understanding.
