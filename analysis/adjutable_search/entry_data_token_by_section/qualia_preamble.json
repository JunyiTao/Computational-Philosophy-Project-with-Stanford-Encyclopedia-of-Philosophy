    "main_text": "\n\nFeelings and experiences vary widely. For example, I run my fingers\nover sandpaper, smell a skunk, feel a sharp pain in my finger, seem to\nsee bright purple, become extremely angry. In each of these cases, I\nam the subject of a mental state with a very distinctive subjective\ncharacter. There is something it is like for me to undergo\neach state, some phenomenology that it has. Philosophers often use the\nterm \u2018qualia\u2019 (singular \u2018quale\u2019) to refer to\nthe introspectively accessible, phenomenal aspects of our mental\nlives. In this broad sense of the term, it is difficult to deny that\nthere are qualia. Disagreement typically centers on which mental\nstates have qualia, whether qualia are intrinsic qualities of their\nbearers, and how qualia relate to the physical world both inside and\noutside the head. The status of qualia is hotly debated in philosophy\nlargely because it is central to a proper understanding of the nature\nof consciousness. Qualia are at the very heart of the mind-body\nproblem. \n\nThe entry that follows is divided into ten sections. The first\ndistinguishes various uses of the term \u2018qualia\u2019. The\nsecond addresses the question of which mental states have qualia. The\nthird section brings out some of the main arguments for the view that\nqualia are irreducible and non-physical. The remaining sections focus\non functionalism and qualia, the explanatory gap, qualia and\nintrospection, representational theories of qualia, qualia as\nintrinsic, nonrepresentational properties, relational theories of\nqualia and finally the issue of qualia and simple minds.\n",
