    "main_text": "General Critiques of Intellectual Property || The Cost of Publishing Digital Information\n4.6 The Cost of Publishing Digital Information\n\nCoy (2007) argues is that, in a competitive market, the cost of\ninformation should properly reflect the cost of making it available to\nusers. On this line of analysis, while the cost of making publishing\ninformation in traditional material media like books might be\nsufficiently high to justify charging users a price for it, the cost\n(per user) of making information available on digital media approaches\nzero as the number of users grow larger. For example, there might be\nsome fixed cost involved in making information available on a website,\nbut no additional cost is required beyond that to make that content\navailable to any number of users; the more users appropriating the\ninformation, the lower the cost of making it available to any\nparticular user. Thus, the argument concludes, it would be unfair to\ncharge users a fee for appropriating any piece of (digital)\ninformation; information should be free (or nearly free) so as to\nreflect its dissemination costs.\n\nThere are two problems with this argument. First, if one accepts the\nlegitimacy of free enterprise, as appears to be presupposed by the\nabove argument, then what is a fair price will be determined by the\nvoluntary interactions of buyers and sellers in a competitive market:\nthe fair price is that which is set by the contractual transactions of\nfree, prudentially-rational buyers and sellers. If buyers in a\ncompetitive market are willing to pay a price for digital information\nthat is significantly higher than the seller\u2019s marginal cost,\nthen that price can be presumed fair. Second, the argument overlooks\nthe fact that the fixed costs associated with producing and\ndistributing intellectual content can be quite high. For example, the\nDisney Company spent more than $100 million in making the film\nWest Side Story in 2021. If one assumes that a fair price is\nsuch as to allow the producer to recover the fixed development costs\nassociated with producing and distributing intellectual content, this\nwould entail that it is fair for content producers to charge a price\nthat is sufficiently above the marginal costs to allow them to recover\nthese fixed costs.\n",
