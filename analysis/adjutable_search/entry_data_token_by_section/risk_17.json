    "main_text": "Risk in economic analysis || Experimental economics\n7.4 Risk-benefit analysis\n\nRisk-benefit analysis (RBA), also called cost-benefit analysis (CBA)\nis a collection of decision-aiding techniques that weigh advantages\nagainst disadvantages in numerical terms. In a typical risk-benefit\nanalysis, multi-dimensional problems are reduced to a single\ndimension. This is achieved by assigning monetary values to all\npotential outcomes. Usually, uncertain outcomes are evaluated\naccording to the expected utility model. This means that the disvalue\nof a risk is obtained by multiplying the probability of the undesired\nevent by a monetary value representing its severity (Sen 2000;\nSunstein 2005).\n\nIn order to make overall alternatives comparable in simple numerical\nterms, all consequences, including losses of human lives, have to be\nassigned monetary values. The discussion about assigning monetary\nvalue to human lives seems to have had its origin in criticism by the\nAmerican Air Force against a report from the RAND Corporation in 1950.\nThe report recommended a military strategy that would result in\nmortality rates for crew members that the military considered to be\nunacceptably high. This was because loss of crew members was not\nincluded in the calculations. This omission had the same effect as\nsetting the value of a soldier\u2019s life at zero. In response to\nthe criticism, the RAND Corporation began to include a life value in\ntheir analyses, but they had considerable difficulties in deriving\nthis value (Banzhof 2014). Their employee Thomas Schelling proposed\nthat life values should be derived from a marginal analysis of\nindividuals\u2019 own valuation of risks of death (Schelling 1968).\nIf a person would accept a death risk of 1/10,000 against a\ncompensation of $400, then that is taken to express a life value of\n10,000 \\(\\times\\) $400 or $4,000,000.\n\nMost of the philosophical discussion on risk-benefit analysis has been\nfocused on the assignment of a monetary value to the loss of a human\nlife (MacLean 1994; Heinzerling 2000; 2002). It has been claimed that\nlives and money are incommensurable, and that the determination and\nuse of such \u201clive values\u201d express a lack of respect for\nhuman lives. Defenders of risk-benefit analysis have countered that\nthese values are just technical constructs representing what society\ntends to pay (alternative: ought to pay) in order to save a human\nlife. Risk-benefit analysis can help decision-makers to save as many\nlives as possible, given that they have a fixed amount of resources\nthat they can assign to life-saving policies (Sunstein 2005).\n\nMany of the value assignments used in cost-benefit analysis are based\non estimates or measurements of (hypothetical) willingness to pay.\nSuch estimates will give more influence to affluent people since they\ncan pay more than others to have it their way. This can be corrected\nwith income-based adjustments of the reported willingness to pay.\nHowever, there are considerable problems involved in the performance\nand interpretation of willingness-to-pay studies (Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff\n2009).\n\nRisk-benefit analysis gives rise to several other philosophical\nproblems of considerable philosophical interest (Hansson 2007). Due to\nits quantitative nature, it tends to leave out problems that are\ndifficult to quantify, such as risks of cultural impoverishment,\nsocial isolation, and increased tensions between social strata.\nFurthermore, due to its aggregative structure, risk-benefit analysis\noften leaves out social justice and other distributional aspects,\nalthough these are in fact accessible to quantitative treatment.\n",
