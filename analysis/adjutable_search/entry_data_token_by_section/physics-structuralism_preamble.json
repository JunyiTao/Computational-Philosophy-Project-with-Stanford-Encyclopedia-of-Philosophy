    "main_text": "\n\nUnder the heading of \u201cstructuralism in physics\u201d there are\nthree different but closely related research programs in philosophy of\nscience and, in particular, in philosophy of physics. These programs\nwere initiated by the work of Joseph Sneed, G\u00fcnther Ludwig, and\nErhard Scheibe, respectively, since the begin of the 1970s. For the\nsake of simplicity we will use these names in order to refer to the\nthree programs, without the intention of ignoring or minimizing the\ncontributions of other scholars. (See the Bibliography.) The term\n\u201cstructuralism\u201d was originally claimed by the Sneed\nschool, see e.g., Balzer and Moulines (1996), but it also appears\nappropriate to subsume Ludwig\u2019s and Scheibe\u2019s programs\nunder this title because of the striking similarities of the three\napproaches. The activities of the structuralists have been mainly\nconfined to Europe, especially Germany, and, for whatever reasons,\nlargely ignored in the Anglo-American discussion.\n",
