    "main_text": "The Philosophy of Color || Resistance to Eliminativism/Subjectivism\n1.2 Resistance to Eliminativism/Subjectivism\n\nThere has been a strong resistance among philosophers, both to the\nEliminativist tendency within the scientific tradition, and the\nrelated subjectivism. One form this resistance takes reflects the fact\nthat each component of this traditional view is very puzzling. A\ncommon response is to say that our color terms\u2014red, blue,\npurple, orange, yellow, green, brown, etc.\u2014are in order: we have\nparadigms of colors to which the color terms apply: ripe lemons are\nyellow, tomatoes and rubies are red, and so on. We have no trouble, by\nand large, in learning these terms and teaching them in ostensive\npractices to children and others. In the second place, it is hard to\nmake sense of the claim that colors are properties of sensations or\nare psychological properties: if they are anything they are properties\nof material objects and light sources\u2014of peaches, and emeralds,\nof skies, of rainbows, of glasses of wine, of headlamps, and so\non.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that things are more complex than the\nearlier remarks of Hume and Maxwell suggest. Descartes and Locke, for\nexample, think that there are no colors in the physical world\u2014no\ncolors, as we ordinarily and naively understand them to be. But they\nare also widely interpreted as holding a secondary quality view of\ncolors, i.e., holding the view that colors are powers or dispositions\nto cause experiences of a certain type. It is instructive to try to\nunderstand this dual position. We find, for example, this passage in\nDescartes\u2019 Principles of Philosophy:\n\n\nIt is clear then that when we say we perceive colors in objects,\nit is really just the same as saying that we perceived in\nobjects something as to whose nature we are ignorant but which\nproduces in us a very clear and vivid sensation, what we call the\nsensation of color. (Descartes 1644 [1988]: para. 70; see also paras\n68\u201370) \n\n\nThe implication of \u201cit is really just the same as saying\u201d\nis that this is not what it is ordinarily taken to be saying. As\nDescartes later explains, the ordinary way involves the mistake of\n\u201cjudging that the feature of objects that we call\n\u2018color\u2019 is something \u2018just like the color in our\nsensation\u2019\u201d. However, Descartes is not implying that we\nshould dispense with our ordinary talk. Instead, it is being\nsuggested, we should go on using our ordinary color talk, but give it\na novel interpretation: when we say \u201cX\u201d, then it is\nas though we said \u201cY\u201d. That is to say, we should\nnot understand the sentences literally, but rather translate them into\nother more appropriate sentences. Descartes, here, is following the\nprinciple common to many thinkers of the time, the principle of\n\u201ctalking with vulgar, and thinking with the learned\u201d. The\njustification for this proposal is that it acknowledges that our color\nlanguage serves very useful purposes: the reconstruction allows the\nlanguage to continue to serve those purposes, while avoiding\nmetaphysical error. Thus, there is at least a partial response to the\ncommon-sense criticism: the reconstruction central to this form of\neliminativism embraces a principle of respect for our ordinary\nlanguage.\n\nThere are also complications with respect to the subjectivist\ncomponent of the traditional view. When philosophers such as Descartes\nand Locke wrote of sensations of color, or of (sensory) ideas of\ncolor, there are different interpretations of what is meant by the\nterms. The common interpretation is that a sensation of red is a\nsensory experience in which a certain subjective quality is presented.\nExpressed in modern terms, the subjective qualities are construed as\nqualia, or as qualities of sensory individuals such as sensa or\nsense-data or as sensational properties. There is, however, an\nalternative interpretation: a sensation of color is a sensory\nexperience, which represents something as having a certain quality\n(the experience has a certain intentional content). On this second\ninterpretation, Descartes\u2019 view would be that the relevant\nquality our color experience represents objects as having is one that\nno object possesses. Accordingly, it would not be inappropriate to\ncall the theory fictionalist (rather than subjectivist). This\ninterpretation, we should note, allows for qualia or sensa, but does\nnot mandate them. And some Cartesian scholars deny that Descartes, in\nparticular, was committed to qualia. \n\nFinally, there is yet another complication. It is in fact possible to\ncombine the two versions in a single interpretation. That is to say,\nthe representationalist view does not rule out a version with\nsubjectivist elements. For such a view allows for a type of\nprojectivism, whereby the experience both presents a sensory quality,\nand represents a physical object as having that quality. The\nexperience is said to \u201cproject\u201d the subjective, sensory\nqualities onto the physical objects. A model for this would be the\nexperience of pain: the supposition is that when one has a toothache,\nthe experience represents the pain as being in the tooth. (This\nprojectivist view seems to suit Hume\u2019s thought, but in any case,\nit fits modern projectivist accounts.)\n\nWe might note the it is common to find, in authoritative texts,\ndefinitions like \u201cColor attributes are attributes of visual\nsensations, e.g., hue, saturation and brightness\u201d; \u201chue:\nattribute of color perception denoted by the terms yellow, red, blue,\ngreen and so forth\u201d; \u201cBrightness is the attribute of a\nvisual sensation according to which a given visual stimulus appears to\nbe more or less intense\u201d. There is a range of ways we might\ninterpret these definitions:\n\n\nColor attributes are:\n\nattributes of sensations;\nattributes presented in sensations;\nattributes sensations represent objects as having.\n\n\n\nSeveral of these ways understanding the definitions leave it open\nwhether physical objects actually have the attributes or not, and\nwhether the attributes (that form part of the representational content\nof the experiences) might have subjective components.\n",
