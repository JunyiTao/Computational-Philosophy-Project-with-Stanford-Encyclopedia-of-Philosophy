In 1927 he was appointed to the Challis Chair\nof Philosophy at the University of Sydney and occupied this position\nuntil his retirement in 1958. In relative isolation he developed a\ndistinctive realist philosophy which was inspirational for generations\nof students at Sydney. While developing this position, he carried most\nof the teaching load in philosophy at the university, wrote the\narticles for which he is primarily known, and as contributor and\neditor kept the Australasian Journal of Psychology and\nPhilosophy going. Shortly after his arrival in Sydney he acted as\ntheoretical advisor to the Communist Party of Australia, but moved\naway from the party through the 1930s and finally adopted a strongly\nanti-communist stance. He remained active throughout his career,\nhowever, in a series of public controversies concerning censorship,\nuniversity reform, academic freedom and opposition to religious\ninstruction in education. Depending upon one\u2019s perspective,\nthese activities diverted him from serious philosophical work or were\nthe natural expression of his philosophical outlook.

Life and Work\n\nJohn Anderson was born in 1893 in the weaving and coal-mining village\nof Stonehouse, Lanarkshire (about 20km from Glasgow). His father was\nschoolmaster in the village and politically active in the Independent\nLabour Party. In 1911 Anderson began his university studies at the\nUniversity of Glasgow, enrolling in two successive honours degrees:\nmathematics/natural philosophy (including laboratory training) and\nlogic/moral philosophy (including political economy). His\nundergraduate studies extended throughout the years of the World War,\nculminating in 1917 with his Masters thesis on the philosophy of\nWilliam James. Declared medically unfit for service, his experience of\nthe war was dominated by the Red Clydeside industrial and rental\ndisputes, characterised by workers\u2019 resistance to state and\nindustry attempts to re-organise work practices and personnel in the\ninterests of a supposed common national interest. The disputes\nultimately led to state suppression at the conclusion of the war when\nBritish troops and artillery were deployed to Glasgow.\n\nAnderson\u2019s philosophical direction was powerfully influenced by\nthe Australian-born philosopher, Samuel Alexander, who delivered the\nGifford Lectures at Glasgow in 1918. In the previous year Anderson had\nbeen awarded for an essay supporting Henry Jones\u2019 practical\nidealist view of the state as a moral agent. Following\nAlexander\u2019s lectures (later published as Space, Time and\nDeity) Anderson accepted the case for the complete rejection of\nthis form of idealism in favour of a new and systematic realist\nprogramme.\n\nIn 1919 Anderson married fellow philosophy student Jenny Baillie, was\nappointed assistant lecturer at University College of South Wales\n(where he also provided Workers\u2019 Education Classes) and was\nsubsequently appointed assistant lecturer in logic at the University\nof Glasgow. In 1920 he was appointed lecturer at the University of\nEdinburgh and so became the main exponent of realism in Norman Kemp\nSmith\u2019s Department of Logic and Metaphysics. In the same year,\nhis brother William accepted the Chair of Mental and Moral Philosophy\nat Auckland University College, New Zealand.\n\nBy 1926 Anderson had become dispirited by the rejection for\npublication of a textbook on logic that he had been working on since\n1922. He had also become politically isolated in the department\nbecause of his support for the General Strike in Britain. Such factors\nmay have moved him to accept the Challis Chair of Philosophy at the\nUniversity of Sydney, although as with his brother, the movement of\nScottish philosophers to Commonwealth universities was not unusual. In\n1927 he moved with Jennie and their young son Alexander\n(\u201cSandy\u201d) to Sydney.\n\nAnderson\u2019s first serious professional engagement was in a\ncritical discussion of F. C. S. Schiller\u2019s logic,\n\u201cPropositions and Judgments\u201d and \u201cThe Truth of\nPropositions\u201d (1926). The first outlines of a distinctive\nrealist position were made in \u201cEmpiricism\u201d and \u201cThe\nKnower and the Known\u201d (1927). After his arrival at Sydney,\nAnderson was intent upon developing this position and was dismissive\nof the fragmentary nature of most international philosophy in the wake\nof the \u201clinguistic turn\u201d. The important philosophical work\nin Anderson\u2019s view was to establish and preserve a school of\nrealist philosophy as the repository of a tradition of critical\ninquiry that would remain alert to the dangers of corrupting external\nforces and expectations. \n\nShortly after his arrival at Sydney, Anderson became a\n\u201ctheoretical advisor\u201d to the Australian Communist Party\nand so began a long history of antagonising conservative political and\ncultural representatives in the city. He was repeatedly accused of\ndisloyalty and communist sympathies by returned servicemen\norganisations, the churches and the conservative political parties.\nThe University Senate ultimately debated censure although a motion to\ndeclare him unfit to occupy the Chair of Philosophy was defeated. \n\nIn 1930 James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses was banned in Australia\nand the Freethought Society was formed with Anderson as President.\nAnderson\u2019s political influence at Sydney primarily took the form\nof a libertarian pluralism, particularly concerned with issues of\nstate and religious censorship and interference in education. By the\n1940s and 1950s his political position was strongly anti-communist.\nYet he remained unpopular with conservative politicians and clerics\nand was criticised for \u201ccorrupting the city\u2019s youth\u201d\nas late as 1961.\n\nIn 1935 Anderson became the editor of The Australasian Journal of\nPsychology and Philosophy. He had previously contributed\nsignificantly to the journal with his articles \u201cDeterminism and\nEthics\u201d (1928), \u201cThe Non-Existence of\nConsciousness\u201d, \u201c\u2018Universals\u2019 and\nOccurrences\u201d (1929), \u201cThe Place of Hegel in the History of\nPhilosophy\u201d, \u201cUtilitarianism\u201d (1932), \u201cRealism\nand Some of its Critics\u201d (1933), and \u201cMind as\nFeeling\u201d (1934). He retained editorial responsibility for the\njournal until 1947 when it passed to John Passmore with the new name\nThe Australasian Journal of Philosophy.\n\nIn 1958 Anderson retired and in 1962 died at his home in\nSydney\u2019s northern suburbs. The Challis Chair of Philosophy was\noccupied for the next 30 years by Anderson\u2019s students, J. L.\nMackie (1959\u20131963) and D. M. Armstrong (1964\u20131991). Both\nphilosophers were critical of Anderson\u2019s philosophy and were\nmore engaged with contemporary philosophical debates, but both also\nacknowledged Anderson\u2019s formative influence on their work.\n\nIn 1972 members of the Department of Philosophy at the University of\nSydney were caught in a bitter dispute concerning subject matter,\neducational practices and the nature of philosophical study itself,\nand by the start of 1974 the department had split into two separate\nunits. D. M. Armstrong led the minority Department of Traditional and\nModern Philosophy away from what he perceived to be the politically\nradical but philosophically barren Department of General Philosophy.\nPolitical disruptions throughout the academic world in the early 1970s\nwere not uncommon, but the particular intransigence and secessionist\ntendencies which characterised both sides of the conflict at Sydney\nmay well have been at least in part a legacy of Anderson\u2019s\nteaching and practice. The department eventually reunited some thirty\nyears later.\n2. Outline of Anderson\u2019s Philosophy\n\nThe emphasis of Anderson\u2019s realism is upon\nindependence, directed particularly at the notion of\nconstitutive relations (which he takes to be the central error of\nidealism), but also employed in qualifying reductivist and\ninstrumentalist forms of scientific explanation. His position is that\nalthough whatever exists has relations and is conditioned, it is\nnonetheless a specific existing thing with qualities of its own. It is\nthe aim of critical inquiry in any given field to identify relevant\nqualities and characteristics and to state the issue in the form of\nobjective and communicable truth. Whatever our interests draw our\nattention to, the truth of the matter is independent of our\nconsideration. Whatever innovative and imaginative uses we make of\nparticular things, those uses are available to us because of existing\nproperties in the things themselves. For Anderson, two aspects of\nphilosophical speculation have been linked throughout the history of\nthe subject, and his own thought can be considered as a single system\nwith these complementary aspects: the logical and the ethical.\n\nFirst, there is a single way of being, that of ordinary things\nbehaving in ordinary ways in space and time. All theories of higher\nand lower realities can only be stated in terms of the common reality\nwe all know and share. Anderson applied this thesis across the board:\nthere are not different kinds or degrees of truth, only\nsomething\u2019s being the case or not; universals and values do not\nexist above the world of space and time in a transcendent sphere of\noperation; powers are not entities distinct from the processes they\nexplain; the mental realm cannot be conceived as operating in a sphere\nseparate from or other than space and time. There is no absolute or\nlogical distinction between universals and particulars \u2013\nuniversals exist within the ordinary world, but never apart from the\nparticulars they describe; that is, there is no ontological level\nabove or below that of the state of affairs or the fact of a\npredicated subject. As the study of the formal features of facts,\nlogic provides an account of what is objectively real: logic entails a\ngeneral ontology.\n\nSecond, Anderson emphasised both the objective and subjective\ndifficulties inherent in the endeavour to see things as they are, and\nthe necessary discipline acquired in ongoing traditions of critical\ninquiry. Confronting the reality of our existence entails recognising\nand not turning away from the ubiquity of conflict, tension and strife\nin all spheres. For Anderson ethical goods exist in the world in such\nactivities as intellectual inquiry, artistic production and scientific\ninvestigation. Ethical investigation is primarily concerned with\nidentifying those human activities which are driven by internal\nstandards of correctness and value and not by concern for external\nrewards or utilities. But these activities exist perilously in a world\nseriously inclined towards stasis and corruption. There is an almost\ntheological depth to Anderson\u2019s pessimism in this regard. \n\nAnderson\u2019s views in normative philosophy are outlined in\nwritings in ethical inquiry, narrowly construed, aesthetics, political\nthought and educational philosophy. Ethics is the study of\nthe real qualities of human activities, not of what is right or\nobligatory, these latter questions being relegated to the study of\ncustomary norms and expectations arising from particular practices and\nways of life. Similarly, aesthetics is the study of the\nqualities of beautiful things, and is neither a study of feelings,\nexpressions or judgments, nor a source of directives for artists. A\nwork of art succeeds to the extent that it objectively portrays its\ntheme, accounts for what is the case (for example, anger\nconsidered as the \u201ctheme\u201d of The Iliad). Literary\ncriticism consists in assessing whether the artist has succeeded,\nobjectively, in capturing or portraying the chosen theme. In his\nsocial and political thought, Anderson holds that society is\na complex of competing and cooperating movements neither united by\ninclusive social purpose, nor reducible to its individual members.\n\nUnderlying both logical and ethical aspects of Anderson\u2019s\nthought is the identification of systematic confusions and errors in\nphilosophical thought. One persistent confusion is the\nmisidentification of relations as qualities. Most commonly, being in\nsome relation is thought to constitute the \u201cnature\u201d of\nsome special status entity. But whereas a term together with a quality\nis a complete unit just as it stands, a term and a relation is simply\nincomplete without a second term. Anderson applied this thesis widely:\nthere are no such things whose nature it is to be known or perceived\n(\u201cideas\u201d); there is no such thing whose nature it is to\nknow (\u201cconsciousness\u201d); there are no such things whose\nnature it is to be pursued or whose nature it is to direct action\n(\u201cvalues\u201d conceived as standing over and above the goods\nand values of this life). Relations are often more evident to us than\nthe underlying qualities of the things related and so relational\nexplanations suggest themselves to us quite naturally. On the other\nhand, significant intellectual effort is required in any given field\nto understand the illusory nature of such explanations and the manner\nin which they obstruct the identification and assertion of real\nissues.\n\nAccording to Anderson, one central confusion infecting modern\nphilosophy since Descartes has been its obsession with epistemological\nquestions, the attempt to provide unshakeable foundations for our\nknowledge of the external world. There is no gap between mind and\nworld that needs to be bridged because mentality belongs to the\nspatio-temporal world along with everything else. This is not to say\nthat misunderstanding is impossible, just that understanding is\npossible. It is possible to know various conditions and characters of\nthings in the first place only because things have these\ncharacters independently of our inquiries. And since as knowers we\noccupy the single world of space and time we come under the same\nconditions and so come into relations with those things that we are\ninvestigating. All knowledge depends upon empirical investigation and\nso is fallible: it is not built upon any more immediate or reliable\nentities such as sense data or self-evident ideas. Epistemological and\nontological bedrock is the complex situation of being there and\nso, a particular\u2019s being of a certain kind. Knowing minds\nare themselves complex spatio-temporal things, societies of emotions\nand feelings without a unifying consciousness to which these might\nbelong nor some ultimate self which could conceivably take a stand\nsomehow outside and beyond the world of space and time. Modern\nphilosophy\u2019s epistemological obsession can be regarded as an\nillogical attempt to look behind the proposition, to gain a sideways\nview of how our propositions hook up to the real world.\n3. Difficulties in Understanding Anderson\u2019s Work\n\nGilbert Ryle listed Anderson among the \u201cseniors\u201d who had\npreceded his own generation: philosophers such as Russell, Moore,\nWittgenstein, Bradley, Stout, McTaggart, Alexander, Laird, and Kemp\nSmith. For Ryle, Anderson\u2019s generation represented \u201cthe\nold gang\u201d, many the products of \u201cthose dominating Scots\nteachers\u201d who had established philosophy as an academic\ndiscipline in English-speaking universities around the world. Anderson\nwas an exact contemporary of Wittgenstein and Heidegger, yet only\nseven years older than Ryle himself. But Ryle seems to have a point in\nsuggesting a generational gap that separated him from that earlier\ngeneration\u2019s \u201cpieties, lores, sagacities, equipments\n\u2013 yes, and fetishes too\u201d (Ryle 1976: 383). Ryle was\ndescribing the generation of philosophers who were adult prior to or\nduring the Great War. He only became acquainted with Anderson in the\n1950s and was struck by the manner in which Anderson had continued a\nform of philosophy into modern times that had given way elsewhere to\nphilosophies more concerned with linguistic usage. Despite this\nrecognition of interpretive challenges, for many of Anderson\u2019s\nfollowers Ryle at that time radically misunderstood Anderson\u2019s\nwork (Ryle 1950), reading it from the perspective of the\n\u201clinguistic turn\u201d.\n\nFor current readers there are indeed several obstacles to approaching\nAnderson\u2019s work. His published works, primarily articles for the\nAustralasian Journal of Philosophy and Psychology and in\nlocal journals and newspapers, are difficult without the context of\nAnderson\u2019s broader teaching. They are generally regarded as\nsubsidiary to the lectures and syllabus of an Andersonian\napprenticeship. It seems that they were written for the benefit of the\nstudents who already had the value of his personal contact. Without\nthis contact, we must rely on the publication of several series of\nlecture notes from Anderson\u2019s papers by Sydney University Press\n(see Bibliography). Anderson\u2019s isolation from his intellectual\npeers and his seeming reluctance to engage in international debate\nalso deprives contemporary students of the opportunity to locate his\nwork within more familiar territory.\n\nOne point of access to Anderson\u2019s work for contemporary\nstudents, of course, lies in the work of his students such as D. M.\nArmstrong, John Passmore, and J. L. Mackie. But there is a danger even\nhere that their specialisations may distort our view of\nAnderson\u2019s work as a whole. Anderson, as Passmore noted, was a\ngeneralist (Passmore, Introduction to Anderson\u2019s posthumous\nwork, Studies in Empirical Philosophy, hereafter\nEMP). Unlike the next generation, he expected all\nspheres of philosophical inquiry to open up to his investigation and\nhis philosophy extended to all spheres: logic, metaphysics, ethics,\npolitical thought, aesthetics, education.\n\nAnderson describes his position variously as empiricist, realist,\nnaturalist, physicalist, positivist and pluralist, conceiving each of\nthese as different aspects of the one truly empirical philosophy. But\nhis use of these terms is problematic for the uninitiated.\nAnderson\u2019s empiricism has no time for representational\nviews of truth, nor for the traditional empiricist entities of sense\ndata or ideas. Empiricism for Anderson is an ontological doctrine\nasserting a single way of being to which we as investigators belong.\nWhile undoubtedly committed to empirical investigation and the\nfallible nature of all propositional claims, Anderson\u2019s\nempiricism is only secondarily an epistemological viewpoint relating\nto how we come to know things within this spatio-temporal world.\nAnderson\u2019s realism rejects the traditional\nrealist-nominalist options concerning the existence of universals.\nUniversals are brought down to (spatio-temporal) earth, but there are\nno such things as pure universals nor pure particulars outside their\nroles within complex states of affairs. Mentality is a\nproduct of physico-chemical processes in the brain but this does not\npreclude our inquiry into the nature of mind as a field of conflicted\ntendencies, feelings and emotions. Whatever the special sciences tell\nus about their particular subject matters, philosophy retains its\nauthority in questions of logic, that is to say, concerning the\nconditions of possibility of discourse. Indeed, modern science is\nbadly infected by instrumentalist and technological views of its\ninvestigations and needs to become more truly philosophical and\ncritical, more concerned with establishing what is the case within\nspecific fields, and less with being practical and useful in relation\nto perceived societal needs (EMP, 290).\nPositivism then is for Anderson a commitment to what is\nobjectively and positively the case, and not a program of instrumental\nor operational truth, nor a means of distinguishing meaningful from\nmeaningless utterances. Anderson\u2019s call for a \u201cscience of\nethics\u201d is not an assimilation of ethical inquiry to the\nstandards of the special sciences. It is a plea for an objective\ninvestigation of the ethical, focussed on the existing ethical\nqualities of human activities, rather than on the pieties of\ntraditional moral philosophy: the questions of right, obligation, duty\nand so forth. \n\nRyle was only the first of many to be accused of misreading Anderson.\nCriticisms of Anderson\u2019s position from within mainstream\nEnglish-language philosophy have always seemed to his followers to\nmiss their mark. They have generally failed to recognise the\nontological, non-representational, non-semantic basis for his\nempiricism. Robert Brandom\u2019s recent criticism and rejection of\nthe \u201ctheoretical, explanatory and strategic commitments\u201d\nmotivating Anglo-American philosophy in the 20th century lists these\nas: empiricism, naturalism, representationalism, semantic atomism,\nformalism about logic, instrumentalism about practical norms (Brandom\n2000). Anderson would reject all of these criticisms of his own work\nas they stand. Brandom regards the notion of \u201cfacts\u201d and\n\u201cstates of affairs\u201d as emblematic of atomistic,\nrepresentationalist thought. Anderson would have replied imperiously\nas he did to Gilbert Ryle\u2019s \u201crepresentationist\u201d\ncriticisms: \u201cThat is nothing to me\u201d. \n\nMany of the problems contemporary readers encounter in\nAnderson\u2019s work result from his relative international\nisolation. But for many of his students it was precisely\nAnderson\u2019s secessionist traditional stance that was the key to\nthe great value of an Andersonian education. He may have failed in his\nproject, but he kept alive at Sydney enduring values of traditional\nphilosophical inquiry at a time when mainstream philosophy was either\nobsessed with linguistic usage on the one hand or in deference to the\nnatural sciences on the other. Many of Anderson\u2019s students\nexpected his philosophy to re-emerge stronger following the inevitable\ndecline of linguistic philosophy and the renewed interest in\nmetaphysical questions which followed this decline. But if his work\nplayed any role in this renewal it was only indirectly through the\nwork of his student D. M. Armstrong. Contemporary philosophers\ninterested in metaphysical questions do not refer to Anderson\u2019s\nwork and are frankly baffled by Armstrong\u2019s enthusiasm for his\nteacher\u2019s work. Anderson exists today almost exclusively in the\nfootnotes of his more engaged and accomplished students.\n4. A Systematic Realism\n\nIn Anderson\u2019s view the realist movement initiated by Russell and\nMoore had ended in failure because it had attempted to overcome\nHegelian philosophy by a return to pre-idealist certainties\n(EMP, 89). As a result, realism had been left without\na school from which to challenge the newly emerging schools of\nidealism and pragmatism (STP, 161). Hegel\u2019s\nall-encompassing system of thought was an example for a new and\nsystematic realism to emulate.\n\nIn brief, Hegel\u2019s attempt to formulate his sequence of outlooks\nrelies upon a realist view of the proposition which is incompatible\nwith his whole theory of outlooks or categories and their varying\nadequacy to reality as a whole. Hegel \u201cunwittingly is proceeding\nin terms of the proposition\u201d but is caught up with the illusory\nattempt to establish an overarching truth (\u201cthat whereby a true\nproposition can be true\u201d), instead of the task of establishing\ntrue propositions (JAA, Lectures on William\nJames, 1935). The same criticism of Hegel seems to be made by Brandom\nin the service of his very different expressionist project (Brandom\n2000). But for Anderson, Hegel\u2019s doctrine of outlooks\n\u201crests on an inability to grasp the independence of\ntruths\u201d (EMP, 81). On the other hand, we need\nonly reject Hegel\u2019s doctrine of expressions to find that we are\nleft with actual states of affairs rather than abstract\nbeing.\n\nNeither Cartesian rationalism nor English empiricism could replace\nHegel\u2019s philosophy with any philosophical position of comparable\nrange. Hegel was right to emphasise system, but not as totality (a\npretended solution to real problems), but in the form of a single\nlogic. He was also right to see this logic as historical, but wrong to\nattempt to replace a \u201clogic of things developing\u201d with the\nnotion of a \u201cdeveloping logic\u201d (EMP, 80).\nAnderson summarises the position as follows. The only way to answer\nHegel would be to drop the modern fixation with epistemological\nquestions altogether and return to a Greek consideration of things. In\naddition to Greek directness, a true replacement for Hegelian idealism\nwould incorporate three major components: a positive theory of the\nmind as feeling and as non-unitary, as much a part of spatial and\ntemporal reality as any non-mental things and events; a true\nempiricism which recognised relations and generals as being as real\n(and as knowable) as the particulars related; and a conception of\nspace and time as conditions of existence rather than of human\nknowledge as in Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism. Anderson\nproposed to replace Hegel\u2019s totality by developing a systematic\nrealism which would incorporate the work of John Burnet on Greek\nphilosophy, of Sigmund Freud on mind, of William James\u2019 radical\nempiricism and of Samuel Alexander\u2019s reworking of Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental aesthetic (EMP, 80). Anderson does not\nmention here another possible source for his direct realism, namely,\nScottish common sense philosophy, but he does consider this in his\nLectures on Thomas Reid of 1935 (LMP).\n\nRichard Rorty has suggested that English language philosophy in the\nearly 20th century emerged from the dominance of Hegelian idealism by\ndeferring to the natural sciences, partly because the alternative\nassociation with modernist literature seemed to threaten \u201ca kind\nof privatised aestheticism which contained disturbing strains of\nirrationalism\u201d (Rorty 1985, p. 748). Superficially,\nAnderson\u2019s work suggests an attempt of some kind to assimilate\nphilosophy to the sciences. But he was a true modernist in relation to\nliterary culture: his articles and addresses include critical works on\nsuch figures as, in particular, James Joyce, but also Lawrence, Shaw,\nWells, Grahame, Belloc, Wilde, Hardy, Ibsen, Meredith, Dostoevsky and\nMelville, as well as on the genre of detective fiction. Literature for\nAnderson had a special character as the embodiment or repository of\nculture (JAA, Lectures on the Educational Theories of\nSpencer and Dewey, 1949). At Sydney in the 1930s he championed both\nthe works of James Joyce (recently banned) and the importance of\nFreudian psychoanalysis to our understanding of mentality as\nconflicted and passionate, and to cultural inquiry more generally\n(cf., Damousi 2005). He thought the pre-modernist \u201cliterary\nphilosophers\u201d of romanticism and idealism had shown\n\u201cgreater tenacity\u201d than those philosophers who professed\nscientific exactitude (EMP, 80). But they had also\ntended to promote forms of moralising and theologising which were\nopposed to precision and independence of thought and which were\n\u201cdetrimental to culture in general\u201d (EMP,\n87). Anderson thought his interpretation of traditional Aristotelian\nlogic had an important role to play in the new world of literary\nculture as much as in the natural sciences.\n\nOne major achievement of Hegel for Anderson was the encouragement he\ngave to the study of Greek philosophers. Anderson\u2019s lectures\nexplored the historical background to his propositional view of\nreality in the issues raised by the pre-Socratics and later in\nPlato\u2019s Dialogues. Like other modernist philosophers and\nnovelists (and Hegel himself), Anderson found in Heraclitus an\ninspirational alternative to what he came to regard as the sentimental\nand intellectually stifling idealism of his teachers.\n\nThis world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or man has made;\nbut it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with\nmeasures of it kindling and measures going out. (Heraclitus Fragment\n20. trans. John Burnet, Early Greek Philosophy 4th Ed., 1930,\np.134.)\n\n\nAnderson acknowledged that Heraclitus\u2019 emphasis on the element\nFire might be read as a typically Ionian response to the question\n\u201cwhat is the world made of\u201d, but the more important theme\nis his treatment of fire purely as process, as transaction and\nexchange, as the paradigm element of strife and harmony. In embryo\nAnderson found in Heraclitus so many of his own principles: the close\nlink between logic and ethics (ethics as the field in which conflict\ncomes primarily to the fore); the single way of being, of \u201cwhat\nis common\u201d (the search for a general logic, a theory of the\ncommensurability of things in terms of a theory of process); the\nrecognition of complexity, conflict and strife underlying existing\nthings; the anti-sentimentality and pessimism which refuses to find\nsolace in unity; the hidden harmony of forces in balance preferable to\nthe open harmony of illusory unity; the unremitting attack on\nsubjectivist illusions of desiring or imagining things as we would\nlike them to be (unchanging and secure) rather than seeing them for\nwhat they are.\n\nFor Anderson\u2019s Heraclitus, \u201cseeing things as they\nare\u201d is seeing them as complex, active and changing; a\nperspective opposed to the optimistic, rationalist illusion of the\nsimple, fixed and static. It is to see things as moving, historical,\nin process, and yet as in balance. Heraclitean \u201cstrife\u201d is\nharmony: the things of everyday experience are positive and concrete\nbecause they are contingent and historical. Anderson described this\n\u201cfundamental strain\u201d in all fields of inquiry as that\n\u201cbetween objectivism and subjectivism\u201d, between\n\u201ccritical thinking\u201d recognising complexity and tension\neverywhere, and \u201crationalist illusion\u201d seeking the fixed\nand simple (JAA, Lectures on Criticism 1955, number 11.).\nRationalism here shared with more primitive mythological thinking the\nquest for stability, security and moral uplift. Both have looked for\nsolutions at a higher level than the problems being addressed.\n\nAnderson\u2019s teaching and writings constantly refer to the history\nof philosophy, but Anderson was not a scholarly historian. He thought\nthat persistent philosophical issues and positions were evident\nthroughout history (eleaticism, for example, was a highly instructive\nand critical stage recurring throughout the history of the subject\n\u2013 for example in Green\u2019s criticisms of Hume\u2019s\nparticulars). The history of philosophy helped to emphasise the value\nof his own position. On the other hand, his lectures and writings are\nladen with references to philosophers, scientists, novelists,\npsychoanalysts and revolutionaries. Nothing seems alien to even the\nmost abstruse topic of discussion in his work. And his lectures were\n\u201cgreat starters of hares\u201d (Partridge\u2019s reflections\non Anderson\u2019s teaching, in EAI). John Passmore\nacknowledges the inspiration of Anderson\u2019s lectures in his own\nworks on Hume, philosophical reasoning, Ralph Cudworth, perfectibility\nand his history of one hundred years of philosophy.\n5. Specific Fields\n5.1 Logic\n\nAnderson wrote a Textbook on Logic in the early 1920s\n(JAA, Textbook on Logic, released 2010) and its fate\ntells us much about his philosophical ambitions. According to his\nbiographer, Anderson submitted the manuscript not to narrowly academic\npublishers but to A. R. Orage, the editor of The New Age\n(Kennedy 1995 p. 64), described by the historian of Scottish\nphilosophy, George Davie, as serving a readership \u201cof\nlibertarian and often leftist autodidacts\u201d (Davie 1977 p. 57).\nUnder Orage the journal was nonetheless a highly influential avant\ngarde modernist vehicle for literary and political criticism. Anderson\nconceived his logic to have wider cultural aims than merely codifying\nforms of reasoning and when Orage rejected the work due to its\nsupposed eccentricity Anderson was deeply disappointed.\n\nLogic for Anderson is concerned with statements, and not with\nquestions, commands, prescriptions, exhortations or other forms of\nexpression. Logic is concerned fundamentally with statements that\nraise an \u201cobjective issue\u201d and these other forms of speech\ndo so only indirectly (JAA, Lectures on Scientific\nMethod, c.1950). Discourse implies a common logic of assertion,\nimplication and definition (EMP, 6). Apparent\ndifferences in logical form are due simply to different modes of\nexpression. Any statement, if it is saying anything at all, can be\nshown by transformation into logical form to be asserting some matter\nof fact: a description of a certain thing as being of a certain kind,\na claim that something is the case. Anderson\u2019s students were set\na range of statements to be transformed into one of the four\nAristotelian propositional forms, traditionally designated as the A,\nE, I and O forms. In any field, until questions or issues are posed in\none of these four propositional forms they will inevitably be confused\nand potentially misleading bases for inquiry.\n\n\nA\nAll As are B\n(AaB) \n\nE\nNo As are B\n(AeB) \n\nI\nSome As are B\n(AiB) \n\nO\nSome As are not\nB\n(AoB) \n\n\nSo, from typical examination papers in Andersonian logic:\n\n\u201cMany hands make light work\u201d\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003A \u2013 All shared activities are\nlightened\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make an omelette without breaking\neggs\u201d\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003E \u2013 No omelettes are things\nmade without breaking eggs\n\u201cIt is by no means unusual to find adulteration in\nmanufactured products\u201d\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003I \u2013 Some manufactured products\nare adultered\n\u201cHis valour is greater than his discretion\u201d\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003O \u2013 Some valourous activities\nof his are not discreet\n\n\nIn Anderson\u2019s view of traditional logic, the universal\nproposition \u201cAll As are B\u201d asserts the\nsimple fact that all As are B; a thing\u2019s being of\na certain sort is the irreducible minimum of a fact or state of\naffairs; there is no assertion of some \u201cgeneral\nconnection\u201d over and above that fact. Nor does the universal\nproposition assert that some class relation holds between A and\nB \u2013 the assertion of a class relation is just a way of\nsaying that certain propositions are true. Nor is it about some\ntotality A: it asserts simply of each and every A that\nit is B. And although it does not directly assert the existence\nof A, it certainly presupposes it. It is indeed the great\nvirtue for Anderson of his version of traditional logic that it fully\nbrings out the existential presuppositions of the proposition. In\naddition, Anderson thinks that what are often taken to be supreme\nlogical truths (for example, identity statements) are not truths at\nall, for they say nothing. There is no analytic truth: if a\nproposition says anything at all, it can be false. Anderson rejects\nthe view that mathematical truths are so only within a calculus, that\nis, derivable from a given set of chosen postulates.\n\nAnderson rejects Mill\u2019s view that universal statements are\ngeneralisations from experience. Universal propositions cannot be\nderived by generalisation from particular experiences, because there\nsimply are no such immediate experiences. Such truths are derived from\nother universal propositions and tested in experience. In discussing\nthe functions of subjects, predicates and the copula in propositions\nand the logical relations between propositions, logic is already\ndiscussing universals, individuals, identity, space-time and\ncausality. And, contra Mill\u2019s inductivism, because we have\ndirect experience of generality and of relations, a single instance is\nsufficient to establish the universal proposition (say, that all glass\nis brittle). Further investigation may challenge such assertions since\nall our beliefs are fallible but wholesale doubt is simply not an\noption. The logical gap between particulars and universals that\ninductive reasoning proposes is a gap that no amount of human\nreasoning could hope to span. Hume was right in this, but instead of\nembracing skepticism he should have concluded as did William James\nthat generality and relations are as much a part of our experience as\nare particulars.\n\nThe validity of the syllogism is fundamental and Anderson rejects the\nabsolute independence from syllogistic reasoning of other forms of\nreasoning such as the relational, hypothetical and disjunctive. The\nsyllogism demonstrates clearly that the subject in one proposition can\nfunction as the predicate in another. The difference between subject\nand predicate is purely one of function: the function of the subject\nterm is to locate, that of the predicate to describe. There are not\ntwo classes of entities involved here; that is, there are no pure\nlocations/particulars/substances, just as there are no pure\ndescriptions/universals. There is no logical gap that needs to be\nspanned between subject and predicate terms: any term can play the\nrole of particular or general, subject or predicate. \n\nFor Anderson logic is the science of the most general features of\nreality. Logic is not simply a useful calculus following on from an\ninitial choice of primitives, and Anderson\u2019s logic is not simply\none version of predicate calculus among others. His view is that logic\ndescribes the general structure of facts and the relations between\nthem. It provides the conditions of possibility for all discourse, but\nit is not about forms of language nor about special status entities\nsuch as universals. It is about the most general features of facts.\nUnderlying this propositional view of reality is the thesis that\nthings within space and time are irreducibly complex. Every situation\nhas both particular and general aspects represented by the subject and\npredicate functions within the proposition. Every predicate can be the\nsubject of a further proposition. The simplest unit is a being there\nand so, a state of affairs in which a particular is characterised in\nsome specific way, but neither the particular nor the universal could\nexist independently. We never arrive at absolutely simple elements in\nany field. The quest for such simples urged by Russell, Moore and the\nearly Wittgenstein indicated a residual rationalist element in their\nthinking. On the other hand, against the idealist opponents of these\nearly realists, Anderson of course insisted that no entities could be\nconstituted, wholly or in part, by their relations\n(EMP, 43). \n\nMackie described Anderson as the last of the Aristotelian logicians\nand observed some awkward consequences for his conception of logic:\nthe problem of false propositions; the absence of a way of\ndealing with singular propositions; an inability to deal with multiple\nquantification; the difficulty in expressing relational propositions\nin subject-predicate and syllogistic form. For Mackie, any logic\ndealing with false propositions, relations of contradiction and\ncontrariety, entertained arguments, falsifications and reductions\nad absurdum must be something more than an account of\npropositions as what is there (Mackie 1985).\n\nAnderson distinguished idealism\u2019s substance-attribute logic that\nhad been condemned by Russell from his own subject-predicate logic.\nNonetheless, his Aristotelian logic of everyday experience did seem to\nsit uneasily with the broader search for logics that could more\nadequately capture forms of reasoning across a wide variety of\ndomains. Ontological logics like Anderson\u2019s came to seem\n\u201cnaively realistic and Aristotelian\u201d, and \u201chard to\nhang on to\u201d in the history of twentieth century philosophy\n(Rorty 1986). It is not just that 20th century philosophy\u2019s\n\u201ccounter-intuitive redescription and relativisation to choice of\nprimitives\u201d (Rorty 1986) ignored Anderson\u2019s insistence\nthat logic is not a calculus. Technical developments in the logic of\nmodal, tense and relational terms proceeded without reference to\nAnderson\u2019s form of onto-logic.\n5.2 Metaphysics\n\nNonetheless, a traditional form of metaphysics did make a resurgence\nin the last quarter of the century in the work of Anderson\u2019s\nstudent, D. M. Armstrong. Armstrong accepts against Anderson that the\nnature of space and time is a matter for scientific investigation, as\nis the identification of real properties \u2013 Anderson\u2019s view\nof three-dimensional space and one-dimensional time as\n\u201contological bed-rock\u201d, for example, simply cannot be\nsustained (Armstrong, introduction to STC). But he\nfinds real interest in Anderson\u2019s conception of the categories,\nas elaborated in the lectures on Samuel Alexander, recently published\nas Space, Time and the Categories: Lectures on Metaphysics\n(STC \u2013 published from typescript lectures in\nArmstrong\u2019s possession and originally presented in\n1949\u201350). In his introduction to these lectures, Armstrong\nwrites:\n\nThe categories of being dive so deep that though quantum physics and\nother physics may have interesting things to say to philosophy \u2013\nin particular whether causation is in fact deterministic \u2013 the\nissues are not susceptible of being resolved at the level of\nexperimental science, yet seem to be real issues. Science may be able\nto cast light on whether causation is irreducibly statistical or not,\nbut how can it decide what causation is in itself? Is it just a\nuniversal or statistical regularity? Or is it something deeper in the\nnature of things? What of the properties and quantities in which\nscience inevitably traffics? Are they just concepts in our minds, or\nsomethings in the objects that our concepts merely reflect?\n(STC, x)\n\n\nIn these lectures Anderson systematically derived the number of\ncategories and their ordering from the nature of the proposition and\nits subject-predicate structure. The result was a scheme of 13\ncategories, laid out in Hegel-like \u201csuccession\u201d organized\nin three groups with the categories of Universality and Quantity\nacting as \u201clink categories\u201d in the two transitions between\nthe groups.\n\n\n(Reproduced from Space, Time and the Categories, with the\npermission of Sydney University Press.)\n\n\nArmstrong concludes:\n\n[W]ith this scheme, John Anderson joins a very distinguished line of\nphilosophers who have presented us with a set of categories. We have\nfirst Plato (the doctrine of Highest Kinds in his dialogue The\nSophist), then Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and Samuel Alexander.\n(STC, xiii)\n\n\nDespite his appreciation of Hegel, Anderson thought that Kant had laid\n\u201cthe foundations for a logic of things as historical\u201d and\nhere \u201cHegel can be regarded only as reactionary\u201d\n(EMP, 83). Kant had shown that the objects of science\nare just the objects of observation, that \u201cmatter\u201d is\nsomething we perceive and not something lying behind our perceptions.\nKant\u2019s answer to Hume was that things perceived are connected\nwith one another; they pass through and affect one another in various\nways because they are related in space and time. We are aware of such\nrelations in being aware of anything at all. But Anderson insists\nagainst Kant that relations are known on the same level as the\nrelated. Kant was still subject to the assumptions of\nrepresentationalism, and thought of the objects of science as mere\nphenomena. Kant viewed space and time as forms of intuition under\nwhich we must experience the world. He viewed the categories such as\ncausality and substance as forms of understanding under which we must\nunderstand the world. Things-in-themselves are not given to us in\nexperience, and so remain beyond our cognitive grasp. In this way Kant\nset up an untenable division in reality between phenomena and\nthings-in-themselves, and along with this division the idea that our\nthoughts, practices and forms of inquiry in some way create or\nconstitute the reality we inhabit, act upon and investigate. Anderson,\nfollowing Samuel Alexander, proposed a realist alternative such that\nspace and time would be considered not as forms of intuition, but as\nforms of being, the categories not as forms of understanding but as\ncategories of being, categories under which all being must fall. On\nsuch a proposal we can recognise the objects of science as\nthings-in-themselves.\n\nAnderson claimed to have avoided the pitfalls of traditional\nmetaphysical questions concerning the reality of universals through\nhis account of the proposition (cf., \u201c\u2018Universals\u2019\nand Occurrences\u201d, EMP). H. O. Mounce has\nsuggested that Anderson\u2019s realism may not be able to avoid the\nissue. In particular, his account of universals is in danger of\ncollapsing into nominalism on the question of whether the directly\nperceived relation (say, of causality) is on separate occasions\none and the same (for Mounce, anything less than complete\nidentity would be a retreat to nominalism \u2013 Mounce 1989). Mounce\nsuggests that Anderson may not be able to hold off a Humean challenge\nhere. He would be drawn back to a familiar realist-nominalist debate\non the nature of universals, which may explain why Armstrong\u2019s\nphilosophy takes seriously Plato\u2019s question of the one and the\nmany as the starting point for metaphysical reflection (Armstrong\n1997). From a Quinean perspective, however, Armstrong\u2019s\nmetaphysics, despite its improved scientific credentials, remains\nattentive to old school pseudo-questions (Quine 1953). (Michael Devitt\nexplicitly associates Armstrong with Quine\u2019s parody of the\ntraditional Scottish metaphysician \u201cMcX\u201d in Devitt\n2010.)\n\nFor his more empirically-minded students, Anderson\u2019s logic\nseemed to rely upon an unwelcome element of a priorism. Any\nweakening of our confidence in Anderson\u2019s identification of\nlogic and ontology, for example, would critically undermine\nsignificant components of the position. First, it would no longer be\nclear that things spoken of together must exist in the same way\n\u2013 the notion of a single level of being would become a matter\nfor investigation (what kinds of differences exist) rather than\ndetermined by general principle (Mackie 1985). Regarding his social\nthought, the importance of individuals\u2019 behaviour in explaining\nthe nature and operation of social movements and institutions would\nrequire investigation, rather than a pronouncement based purely on\ngeneral grounds. Again, Anderson\u2019s rejection of the rationalist\nview that there must be simple or ultimate units upon which\ncomplex things can be built would not lead without further argument to\nthe view that there cannot be such simple parts or totalities\n(Mackie 1985).\n\nAccording to Anderson, David Hume\u2019s skepticism was a direct\nresult of his inability to work out a logic, to create a coherent\naccount of existence. But his mentor at Edinburgh, Norman Kemp Smith,\nhad long argued that Hume\u2019s importance was in demonstrating the\nfactual limits of all logic. If Hume had failed to work out a logic to\nAnderson\u2019s satisfaction this was because in his view\nphilosophers should resist the temptation of this kind of\n\u201csystematic working out\u201d altogether (Davie 1977).\nHume\u2019s reservations about a \u201csystematic working out\u201d\nhave emerged in another form with the \u201clinguistic\nreturn\u201d proposed by Huw Price, who became the first\nappointment to the Challis Chair of Philosophy within a united\ndepartment at Sydney since the split of 1974. Price describes the\nproject as a \u201clinguistic retooling of metaphysics\u201d (Price\n2011, p. 18) and the attempt specifically to avoid Mackie\u2019s\n\u201cplacement\u201d issue which arises from an obsession with the\nrepresentational aspect of language (although Mackie himself regarded\nthis with Anderson as an ontological issue \u2013 see section 5.4\nbelow). On Price\u2019s view plurality exists in the world of an\nentirely familiar kind: a plurality of ways of talking and ways of\nbehaviour which don\u2019t need to be mirrored in an ontology of any\nkind.\n\nIt has been observed that Anderson\u2019s most prominent students\naccepted in fact very little of his system. It is still the case that\ntheir most fundamental philosophical commitments can be traced to the\nboldness of Anderson\u2019s position. And Armstrong suggests that the\nphilosopher at some point can only outline his or her most basic\ncommitments. Stephen Mumford summarises Armstrong\u2019s own position as\nfollows: no God, no non-spatial minds, no abstract\nentities beyond space-time, no Platonic forms or realm of universals;\nan austere ontology without transcendent universals, realm of numbers,\ntranscendent standards of value, timeless propositions, non-existent\nobjects, possibilia, possible worlds, abstract classes (Mumford 2007\np. 5). Armstrong diverges from Anderson in his emphasis upon\nscientific naturalism, in the position that the world is to be\ncompletely described in terms of a completed physics. What properties\nexist will ultimately be determined solely by science, and the results\nwill inevitably seem counter-intuitive within the perspective of\nAristotelian common sense. But for Armstrong this scientific view can\nbe reconciled with a form of metaphysical realism derived from\nAnderson\u2019s teaching which takes universals to exist immanently\nrather than in a transcendent realm; which takes the world to contain\nnothing but particulars having properties and being related to each\nother; which takes the world to be nothing but a single\nspatio-temporal system; which regards reality as a world of states of\naffairs conceived as particulars bearing properties; which insists\nthat states of affairs are the smallest units of existence since\nneither particulars nor universals are capable of independent\nexistence. \n5.3 Epistemology\n\nThe Greeks, according to Anderson,\n\nare far clearer on many questions than modern philosophers \u2026\nthey avoid many modern errors, and especially \u2026 they are not,\nlike the moderns, obsessed with \u2018the problem of knowledge\u2019\n\u2013 they do not set out to discover (i.e., to know!) how, or how\nmuch, we can know, before they are prepared to know anything. This\n\u2018criticism of the instrument\u2019 amounts to scientific\ndefeatism, and the instrumental view of mind has both prevented a\nknowledge of minds themselves, and hampered the direct inquiry into\nlogical and other scientific problems. (EMP, 82)\n\n\nAnderson\u2019s Hegelian diagnoses of the obsessions of modern\nphilosophy and Cartesianism with epistemology are likely to elicit\nrecognition and appreciation from many contemporary readers.\nCartesianism in modern philosophy represented for Anderson an\nanti-classicist movement: an antipathy towards history and tradition.\nModern philosophy searched within abstract rationality as the ground\nof human knowledge, rather than in concrete and many-sided culture.\nThe whole modern era was characterised by this lack of concreteness\n(EMP, 195). \n\nHegel in this regard stands out as a lonely classical figure within\nthe history of modern philosophy (EMP, 201).\nPhilosophy since Descartes has become infected by practicalism and\nprogressivism and logic has been reduced to the status of an\ninstrument, a generalised method for acquiring new knowledge. Along\nwith this instrumental view of logic came contempt for the syllogism,\nreplaced by Bacon with \u201cinductive reasoning\u201d and by\nDescartes with rational intuition. \n\nEmpiricism for Anderson is primarily the denial of any higher form of\nbeing, any other reality by which experienced reality can be found\nwanting, or dependent, or in a position of striving to emulate, and so\nforth. So also, the importance of modern realism lies not in its\naccount of knowledge, but its development of a theory of independence,\nthe rejection of any conception of relative existence and the\ndevelopment of a logic of situations (JAA, Philosophy\nII Distinction Lectures, 1937).\n\nThere is no criterion of \u201ctruth\u201d, \u201cnothing by\nbelieving which we believe something else\u201d\n(EMP, 55). Truth is simply what is conveyed by the\ncopula, the \u201cis\u201d of the proposition. It cannot reside in\ncorrespondence between a believed proposition and something else we\ncall reality, nor in relations between propositions in terms of\ncoherence. Propositions are not forms of words: we convey our beliefs\nby words, but what we are putting forward for acceptance is not the\nform of words but the state of affairs itself. Representionalist and\ncorrespondence theories of truth are \u201cattempts to get behind the\nproposition \u2013 to maintain (in words!) that we mean more than we\ncan say.\u201d (EMP, 5). We must abandon the notion\nof \u201cthought\u201d as something contrasted with or identified\nwith things. Our thoughts are just our dealings with things \u2013\nAnderson shared with Norman Kemp Smith a quasi-Calvinist conception of\nknowledge as a striving and grappling with problems rather than\nmirroring an external reality. Anderson dismisses most contemporary\nphilosophies as \u201cvarieties of representationalism\u201d\n(EMP, 87). The proposition is not \u201cabout\u201d\nanything in the sense of representing an external reality. \n\nOne of Anderson\u2019s most audacious articles was the 1934\n\u201cMind as Feeling\u201d which attempts to work out exactly how\nmentality should be conceived as belonging to the spatio-temporal\nrealm. Anderson believed that once we admit the spatial nature of mind\nor of anything mental, \u201cCartesianism goes\u201d\n(JAA, Lectures on Reid, 1935.) The mental realm\nconsists as much of situations as the natural and social world, so our\nknowledge of mind is on the same footing as the non-mental. He\nrepudiates the Cartesian subject-object model which sees\nphilosophy\u2019s task as the study of the medium for knowledge\nunderstood as the relation whereby one entity reproduces within itself\nthe essence or intrinsic characteristics of some other entity. There\nis no such medium for there are not different entities within space\nand time requiring such mediation. There is no \u201cknower\u201d\nconceived as a point of consciousness that has stepped outside\nhistory, outside of space and time. In our striving and grappling with\nillusions so as to come to terms with ourselves and the things around\nus we never step outside the movement of things, nor see behind the\nproposition; never reach outside the realm of propositional claim and\ncounter-claim.\n\nWhat is this thing that strives? Anderson adopts a Nietzschean,\npre-Socratic view of mentality as a social structure of instincts and\npassions competing and cooperating. It is the emotions or feelings\nthemselves that strive. The passion of curiosity, for example, is the\nactual agent of inquiry. There is no entity of conscious willing that\ndirects our attention on the world. \u201cPart of the deception, of\ncourse, part of the \u2018analytic\u2019 myth, is of an egoistic\ncharacter (\u2018what do I find when I set my analysis\nmachine rumbling?\u2019), and this is opposed to the fact that\nlanguage and inquiry are inherent in social life, are at all stages\npart of communication.\u201d (EMP, 181.)\n\nThat critical inquiry itself rests on the existence of specific ways\nof carrying on and proceeds from within some definite way of life,\nprovides one important link with the ethical aspect of\nAnderson\u2019s thought. Such ways of life which lift individuals out\nof their humdrum existence and base material concerns are what\nAnderson regards as the embodiment of ethical goodness. For Anderson\nif the good exists we must find it as a natural quality in this world,\njust as we come to know and identify other natural qualities. However,\nthe good is not merely something we discover, but \u201cthat by which\nwe discover things\u201d (EMP, 266). Anderson was\naware that his view of the good as a natural quality would not\nconvince everyone, and that he could do little to convert the\ndoubters. But he claimed that there will be those who recognise the\ntruth of his position, seeing this view of the good as\n\u201csomething with which they have long been in a certain way\nacquainted\u201d (EMP, 267).\n5.4 Ethics\n\n\u201cWe do not, in fact, step out of the movement of things, ask\n\u2018What am I to do?\u2019 and, having obtained an answer, step in\nagain. All our actions, all our questionings and answerings, are part\nof the movement of things.\u201d (EMP, 241). \n\nPositive ethical inquiry for Anderson is concerned with the\nidentification of good as a natural quality and he finds that this\nmost naturally pertains to certain actually existing practices and\nways of living in the world of common experience. Traditionally the\ngood has been identified abstractly as an end to be achieved or aimed\nfor, either as a transcendent reality to which we can only aspire (but\nwhich in some unexplained way is supposed to guide our moral actions)\nor as an end external to our actions in the real world and by which\nthose actions may be evaluated; for example, some optimal quantum of\nhappiness or welfare for the greatest number of people involved. In\neither case, a relational explanation is mistakenly offered in place\nof identifying a real quality. This has been the problem with\nvirtually all moral thought since the Greeks, although Anderson\nthought that G. E. Moore had made important advances in our thinking\non these matters. Anderson proposes that the good exists in forms of\nenterprise, productive activities capable of developing in a special\nway by means of \u201ccommunication\u201d \u2013 individuals are\ncaught up in these goods and in the process transcend their more\nimmediate and mundane goals and demands. Any theory of social life\nmust take account of activities with no formulated end: customs,\nregular forms of behaviour, and practices which precede the\nformulation of ends (JAA, Philosophical Implications\nof Marxism, 1945).\n\nValues have objective reality, but not in a transcendent realm\ndivorced from this world of facts or states of affairs. Anderson\nagrees that \u201cthe way things are\u201d includes moral facts:\n\u201cit is impossible to discuss social processes except in terms of\nways of living or forms of enterprise, and that is moral\ncharacterisation\u201d (EMP, 330). But he cannot\naccept that moral characterisation entails moral prescription because\nthis would commit us to a morality of commands, and to programmes for\naction and reform designed to achieve a merely external good. The\nimportance of ethical inquiry is in giving an account of\nproductive activities which entail the operation of a certain\nmentality or spirit. Within such activities there is no question of\nexternal ends or rewards to be achieved. Goodness exists in free,\nspontaneous participation in such movements and activities (although\nnot of course in the metaphysical sense of undetermined free will\n\u2013 such practices, social movements and ways of life are not\nthings we as individuals \u201copt into\u201d at will; they in a\nsense adopt us). Acting because we feel obliged so\nto act is on this view an indication of the absence of\ngoodness. Although the notion of \u201cvirtue\u201d does not much\nappeal to him, Anderson\u2019s emphasis upon the transformative role\nof practices and ways of life upon the ethical outlook of the\nindividual does seem to accord with many of the major preoccupations\nof virtue ethicists. Alasdair Macintyre recognises the value to\ncontemporary Aristotelian virtue ethics of Anderson\u2019s\nHeraclitean appreciation of conflict and the importance he attributes\nto critical traditions (Macintyre 1981).\n\nEthics is especially concerned to bring out the facts of conflict, the\nopposition of different strains in things in general, but in human and\nmental life most particularly. The category of causality is central to\nthe ethical sphere \u2013 false views of causality represent the\nattempt to escape conflict, to gain a standpoint above that of strife\nand interlocking tensions (JAA, Lectures on\nCriticism, 1954). Positive ethics exhibits the good life as constantly\nstruggling with difficulties and other types of life driven by\nexternal or instrumental considerations (JAA,\nLectures on Greek Theories of Education, 1954). The good exists in\nstruggle and so cannot be made secure (JAA,\nPhilosophy I Lectures, 1943). In all spheres of life the good can only\nmake its stand. Attempts at reconciliation and compromise often\nobscure the issues and may well prove detrimental to the good. The\nresulting Heraclitean harmony is best served by this stance of\nindependence and intransigence.\n\nSociological inquiry is appropriate for the bulk of traditional moral\nterms. Forms of social organisation develop regular habits of action\nwhich come to be seen as obligatory: rights, duties and so forth are\neasily understood by those involved in the same way of life. Bourgeois\nsociety is based on commodification and contractual relations. The\nmarket destroys folk life and with it one important source by which\nculture can be refreshed (JAA, Lectures on Marx,\n1950). Marxism has made important advances in this area but Anderson\nnotes the \u201csimple-mindedness\u201d of most Marxists on moral\nquestions \u2013 altruism seems to be the peak of their thinking\nabout morality (Cf., remarks on Kautsky, EMP, 321)\nand little consideration is given to the importance of a plurality of\nways of living.\n\nParticipation in disinterested activities represents the ethical value\nof \u201cdevotion to a cause\u201d. Anderson even offers a\nsociological interpretation of sin as a person\u2019s sense of\ninadequacy to social movements, one\u2019s inability to keep the flag\nflying, to devote oneself thoroughly to these kinds of activity. Sin\nappears then as a kind of backsliding and subjectivism: the individual\nsetting him or herself up as the standard. Anderson was opposed to all\nforms of religious instruction and interference in educational\npractice, but he occasionally shocked his students with a\nquasi-theological appreciation of the existence of evil in the world.\nPassmore commented that forms of religion that emphasise that our life\nis not of our making and that it goes on independently of our plans,\nare far more preferable in Anderson\u2019s view to any form of\nsecular sentimental humanism (Passmore, Introduction to\nEMP).\n\nJ. L. Mackie regarded Anderson\u2019s positive conception of goods as\nbeing \u201chopeless as an account of moral talk and reasoning\u201d\n(Mackie 1985). However, despite being one of the current standard\nbearers for anti-realism in ethics the manner in which Mackie posed\nthe question of the subjectivity of values owes much to\nAnderson\u2019s ontological standpoint. Mackie seemed at pains to\nexplain that his subjectivist view of ethical terms complied with\nAnderson\u2019s main concern. Subjectivism in ethics is for Mackie\nthe doctrine that objective facts in this field do not include any\ndescriptive assignment of goodness or rightness of actions. It is\n\u201cprecisely because we want to distinguish what is simply and\nabsolutely the case that we say values/obligations are\nrelative.\u201d (Mackie 1985). Mackie suggested that linguistic\nphilosophy had made the realist-antirealist opposition a philosophical\npseudo-question, and that with renewed interest in ontological issues\nthis opposition returned in a pressing form in the\n\u201cplacement\u201d issue regarding various \u201cqueer\u201d\nentities in the world.\n\nRush Rhees was a student of Anderson\u2019s at Edinburgh and, of\ncourse, later of Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s. Like Mackie, he was\ncritical of Anderson\u2019s ethical theory, but from the other pole\nin that he was more inclined towards Anderson\u2019s positive view of\nethics. He regarded Anderson\u2019s notion of a \u201cway of\nlife\u201d as at some level the same as Wittgenstein\u2019s (Rhees\n1969). But he came to think that Anderson paid too little attention to\nthe ways in which moral questions are posed for individuals, that\nAnderson too readily portrayed individual concerns as base,\negocentric, low concerns in contrast with the uplifting concerns\nresulting from participation in social movements. Anderson, Rhees\nconcluded, had no appreciation for the urgency with which moral\nquestions presented themselves to individuals (Rhees 1999, p. xiii),\nnor their distinctive character compared to more practical questions\nof how to go on. However, Rhees always emphasised the Andersonian\nlesson that values are rooted in different traditions and movements.\nWe have to resist the temptation to locate values in a realm which\ntranscends these contexts. It is futile to argue that the moral\nindividual is located in a realm outside history, outside the\nparticularities of space and time. Only in these contexts do the\nindividual\u2019s convictions, problems, struggles and difficulties\nhave their sense. Resources for criticism of moral codes exist within\nmovements, and criticism develops only within ways of living. Notions\nof the \u201ccommon good\u201d generally conceal special interests\n(Rhees 1989, p. 53).\n5.5 Social and Political Thought\n\nAnderson\u2019s moral and political thought was strongly influenced\nby the writings of the French socialist Georges Sorel (and before him\nthe libertarian socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon). Although Anderson\nabandoned communism and socialism as movements whose time had passed,\nthe influence of these thinkers for whom socialism was a moral\nmovement remained with him (Cole 2009). In all fields of human\nactivity, there is a conflict between what Sorel described as the\n\u201cethic of the producer\u201d, characterised by spontaneous and\ncooperative endeavour, and the ethic of the consumer, characterised by\nan instrumental morality of reward and punishment, obligation and\nexpectation, an ethic most perfectly suited in sociological terms to\nthe marketplace (and in purely psychological terms to the compulsive\nobligations of the neurotic personality). More accurately, for\nAnderson, the ethic of the consumer is an ethic without a\ntheme. In history there are classical periods of cultural\nachievement in contrast with periods in which we struggle to find a\ntheme at all; that is, periods in which nothing really happens,\nnothing develops from within. Anderson also admired Vico\u2019s\ncyclical view of history and by the 1940s had not only resigned\nhimself to the collapse of heroic 19th century socialism, but\ndiscerned in the era of post-war optimism and state planning the early\nstages of one of Vico\u2019s periods of barbarism\n(EMP, 290). More positively, for Anderson the\nrejection of all totalising views, the thesis that \u201cno formula\ncovers all things\u201d, has the practical consequence of supporting\nand encouraging \u201ca life of responsibility and adventure\u201d\nfor those prepared to face the situation (EMP,\n86).\n\nAnderson intended to combat the influence of idealism in our thinking\non political issues evident since Plato\u2019s Republic. The\nmodernist, realist project he meant to develop in opposition to the\npolitical outlook of British Idealism would draw upon the major\ntheorists of conflict, struggle and cyclic historical movement:\nHeraclitus, Vico and Sorel. In place of a simple contrast between\nindividual and state Anderson insisted upon the complex interplay of\nmovements, institutions and traditions. In place of an unargued\ntendency towards ever greater social harmony he insisted on the\ninevitability of conflict and constant adjustment, the persistent\ndanger of regress, and the consequent need for clear lines of critical\nengagement. Order is a Heraclitean state of balance between complex\ninteracting forces rather than a normative standard by which to\nmeasure existing social and political formations. Conflict is not an\nindication of social dysfunction which needs to be overcome or\nrationalised away, but a necessary feature of any social institution.\nAny notion of an ideal state without such features can have no bearing\non our present real life situation.\n\nAnderson\u2019s political thought is distinctive for his rejection of\nthe state as the fundamental object of political investigation and\nreflection. This aspect of his thought aligns rather strongly with\nmodern Nietzschean and anti-humanist political thought. For Anderson\nthe social is not reducible to agreements among atomic individuals. In\nhis anti-individualist statements, however, he seems to echo an\nidealist view of social movements portrayed, for example, by Bernard\nBosanquet who similarly decried the \u201crepellent isolation\u201d\nof atomist individualism. Culture and human achievement depend upon\nthe capacity of human beings to engage in activities that take them\noutside themselves. Apart from these struggles with nature or within\nbroad social movements, a person collapses into non-entity (Bosanquet\n1899, pp. xxxiii ff.). \n\nAnderson\u2019s rejection of good as an end to be achieved applied to\nhis ultimate rejection of socialism as a progressive movement and of\nMarxism in particular. \u201cThe doctrine of history as struggle is\nat once the liberal and the scientific part of Marxism; the doctrine\nof socialism as something to be established (\u2018classless\nsociety\u2019) is its servile part\u201d (EMP,\n339). Socialism for Anderson was not a goal to be achieved but a\nmovement to be joined. The amelioration of social conditions of the\nworkers would be achieved by the workers themselves in the process of\nasserting the value and validity of their way of life within the wider\nsocio-political sphere. But once alleviation became the primary goal\nof the workers\u2019 movement and representatives, that movement was\nfinished as a progressive and liberating force. It could be bought off\nby employers and the state. Socialism understood as a force lobbying\nfor state action and funding to redress market inequities had become\nmired in \u201cservility\u201d as a matter of historical fact.\n5.6 Education\n\nIn the 1950s, Anderson retreated from broad political theory which had\nbeen a feature of his lectures and writings of the 1940s, and attended\nmore to local and institutional questions. This new emphasis emerged\nin his lectures on education and on criticism. Central to\nAnderson\u2019s view of education is the rejection of any utilitarian\nor instrumental view of education, the view of education as a means to\nsome other purpose. Education needs to be understood as an activity\nwith positive characteristics of its own. Education is critical,\ndevoted to developing and discarding hypotheses, to seeing through\npretensions of all kinds. It means for the individual \u201cfinding a\nway of life\u201d and it affects the whole life of the educated\nindividual. Critical intellectual life survives as a social tradition,\na \u201cmovement\u201d to which individuals are attracted and in\nwhich they are caught up.\n\nAnderson\u2019s classicism promotes the history of European culture\nfrom the early Greeks as a tradition of critical thought that can\nrefresh and fortify contemporary education against the predations of\npracticalism and servility in the modern world. Education is concerned\nwith training in taste and judgement. The educated individual is not\nshackled by the assumptions of his society or group\n(JAA, Lectures on the Educational Theories of Spencer\nand Dewey, 1949). But to play its part, education must resist outside\nstandards (such as those set by the attitudes and capacities of\ncommercial society, or by the vocational needs of business) as to what\nis to be allowed and valued in institutions of education. Rhees\nsuggested that Anderson was primarily concerned with a \u201cgrammar\nschool education\u201d, one not suited to the \u201cmasses\u201d\n(Rhees 1969 p. 168). In particular, for Anderson, vocational and\nmoralistic standards have to be resisted. True learning is not easy\nand cannot be made easy \u2013 it advances only through overcoming\nresistances. The inquiring life has to stand up for itself. It is just\nas real, just as practical, just as positive a part of society as\nother activities (J. L. Mackie, in EAI).\n\nAny activity or institution of learning can proceed only along the\nlines of certain traditions with custodians and in terms of common\nactivities (JAA, Lectures on Greek Theories of\nEducation, 1954). For education is simply one struggling tendency in\nsociety itself among others \u2013 even within institutions\nsupposedly devoted to educational aims, true educational values have\nto be fought for. \n\nAnderson\u2019s lectures on education are of interest because they\ninclude the most extensive account of his appreciation for the\nclassicism of Matthew Arnold, but more particularly of his attitude\ntowards the philosophy of John Dewey. Besides his early\nacknowledgement of the importance of William James (at least the more\nmetaphysical writings on radical empiricism) and his critical articles\non F. C. S. Schiller, the consideration of Dewey\u2019s educational\ntheory is the most important reflection on American pragmatism in\nAnderson\u2019s work. The question of the relation of theory to\npractice was one that exercised Anderson repeatedly. His position was\nthat the connection was a close one, but not in the direction that he\nassumed pragmatism urged. Theory was not dependent upon practice for\nthe validity of its findings. Rather inquiry proceeded from particular\nkinds of practice. Certain forms of life made possible an objective\nview of things. Moreover, theory was not subsidiary to practice in an\ninstrumental sense because it was itself a distinct form of practice\nwith its own requirements and standards. Anderson reflected upon this\nquestion both in the lectures on education but also in his lectures on\nMarxism and most particularly on Marx\u2019s Theses on\nFeuerbach where he was concerned to dispute Sidney Hook\u2019s\npragmatist reading of the theses (JAA, Philosophical\nImplications of Marxism). Both the fact of his consideration of the\nenigmatic Theses and his substantial conclusions on the\nrelation of theory to practice would have resonated with the\nAlthusserian Marxists in the Department of General Philosophy in the\n1970s. \n6. Influence Beyond the University: the Sydney Push\n\nAnderson\u2019s influence extended beyond the confines of the\nacademy. One of Anderson\u2019s students, a young man from the\nPacific island of Tonga, Futa Helu, later claimed that John\nAnderson\u2019s realism had revolutionised his thinking, particularly\nwith reference to the notion of \u201ctapu\u201d or the sacred, as\nthe cover-up for the special demands of the ruling class in Tonga.\nReturning to Tonga in the early 1960s, he founded the Atenisi (Athens)\nInstitute as an independent high school based on the ideals of Greek\nphilosophy. He added \u201cAtenisi University\u201d in 1975, where\nthe philosophical thought of Heraclitus as interpreted by Anderson\nbecame the backbone of philosophy courses. Following Anderson\u2019s\nexample of public engagement, Helu is credited as one of the\nintellectual architects of the democracy movement in Tonga (Keith\nCampbell, personal communication).\n\nAnderson\u2019s influence on the self-styled \u201cSydney\nPush\u201d is more widely known. The latter was a diffuse sub-culture\nof anarchist libertarians who met around Sydney\u2019s inner city in\nthe 1950s and 1960s. Members were imbued with a spirit of\nanti-careerism, and a major influence in their meetings, talks and\ndrinking sessions was the philosophy of John Anderson who had lectured\nmany of them on the value of risk, endeavour, withdrawal from\nconsumerist society and the overriding value of criticism to the\nhealth of a society. Through his influence on many of these figures,\nAnderson affected the tone of intellectual debate and discussion in\nSydney and beyond. If the key figures of the movement are relatively\nunknown, there were more famous figures who moved through this\nenvironment and were on their own accounts deeply affected by its\nintellectual stimulus: such figures as Germaine Greer, Robert Hughes\nand Clive James.\n\nMore centrally involved with the life of the Push over an extended\nperiod and more particularly with the direct teachings of John\nAnderson was the anarchist activist and philosopher George Molnar. He\nattended Anderson\u2019s lectures in the 1950s and was active in\ndebates on metaphysical questions in the 1960s associated with\nArmstrong and C. B. Martin. Students recall Armstrong and Molnar in\nthe university quadrangle around 1970 arguing about dispositions and\npowers with an intensity no doubt propelled by their political\ndisagreements at the time. Molnar conducted courses on anarchism and\neducation theory in the early 1970s but in 1976 resigned his position\nat the university, a move consistent with the anti-careerist ethos of\nthe Push and of the radical politics of the time. Perhaps he also\nfound his philosophical interests on the wrong side of an\nirreconcilable split within the department. Some thirty years later,\nhe returned to academic life to take up a part-time position as John\nAnderson Research Fellow at the University of Sydney, but died\nunexpectedly in 2002. His book Powers: a study in metaphysics\nwas published posthumously in 2007 by Oxford University Press at the\nurging of his old adversary D. M. Armstrong.\n7. Conclusion\n\nWhile sharing some of the deflationary ambitions of linguistic,\nscientific and pragmatist philosophies with respect to traditional\nmetaphysics and rationalism, Anderson\u2019s philosophy was a\nsingular expression of twentieth century philosophy emerging from the\nworld of 19th century idealism. Not only are the terms Anderson\nemploys systematically misleading to contemporary readers; his work\nbelongs to a world of higher philosophical ambition, a world in which\nphilosophy could aspire to a central role in cultural affairs, unlike\nthe \u201crickety philosophical apparatus\u201d and the whole\n\u201cintellectual mess\u201d that he saw in mid-century philosophy\n(EMP, 187\u201388).\n\nThe current lack of philosophical interest in Anderson seems to derive\nas much from external factors related to his place in Australian\nintellectual life as from the intrinsic qualities of his work. This is\ndue in part to his posthumous role in the culture wars prompted by his\nstrongly anti-communist stance in the 1950s. Any consideration of his\nwork soon becomes entangled in unwelcome and extraneous debates.\nMoreover, compounding \u201ca certain Presbyterian\nintransigence\u201d in his personality (EAI, 22),\nAnderson\u2019s conception of philosophy as something of a master\ndiscipline legislating legitimate forms of inquiry in the sciences,\npsychology, social studies, literature, linguistics, and the\nhumanities made him an unpopular figure in the academy (cf.\nPartridge\u2019s and Kamenka\u2019s accounts of their studies with\nAnderson in EAI).\n\nDavid Armstrong describes Anderson as \u201ca failed great\nphilosopher \u2013 he played for higher stakes than the rest of\nus\u201d (personal communication). A certain ambivalence creeps into\nsuch assessments of his importance. On the other hand, while there are\nthose who regard Anderson as almost heroically holding out against\nfalse philosophical fashions, there are many who regard his dominance\nat Sydney as wholly negative: his indifference to developments in\ntechnical logic since the 19th century, to developments in theoretical\nphysics and to philosophical interest in linguistic usage and the\nnature of scientific inquiry. Did Anderson sustain traditional\nphilosophical values and standards of inquiry in the face of\nfragmentary and unsound philosophical trends, or did he cut Sydney\nstudents off from the life blood of international philosophical and\nscientific exposure? The philosophical prominence of many of his\nstudents strongly suggests the former, but even his most loyal\nfollowers recognise in his educational practice a tendency to promote\nuncritical conformity.\n\nIn the end the issue concerns the value and depth of a tradition of\nphilosophical inquiry and apprenticeship, weighed against the\nopportunity costs of pursuing such a tradition to the exclusion of all\nothers. This question was posed rather urgently a decade after\nAnderson\u2019s death when the department of philosophy at Sydney\nsplit into two distinct units, immediately on political grounds, but\ninevitably also over the nature of philosophical inquiry and study\nitself. Although the department was eventually re-united as a single\nprofessional and productive unit, its members have very little\ninterest in revisiting a troubled history. And this applies most\nparticularly to the highly distinctive work and legacy of Professor\nJohn Anderson, the dominant force in philosophy at Sydney for much of\nthe twentieth century.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works by Anderson", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works by Anderson": ["</h3>\n<h4>Published in his lifetime</h4>\n<table class=\"vert-top cellpad-small\">\n<tr>", "[<em>EAP</em>]", "<em>Education and Politics</em>, Sydney: Angus and Robertson,\n1931. </tr>\n<tr>", "[<em>EMP</em>]", "<em>Studies in Empirical Philosophy</em>, Sydney: Angus and\nRobertson, 1962. </tr>\n</table>\n<h4>Selections published after his death</h4>\n<table class=\"vert-top cellpad-small\">\n<tr>", "[<em>AAR</em>]", "<em>Art and Reality: John Anderson on Literature and\nAesthetics</em>, Janet Anderson, Graham Cullum and Kim Lycos (eds.),\nSydney: Hale and Iremonger, 1982. </tr>\n<tr>", "[<em>EAI</em>]", "<em>Education and Inquiry</em>, D.
