    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nIn philosophy, three families of perspectives on scientific theory are\noperative: the Syntactic View, the Semantic View,\nand the Pragmatic View. Savage distills these philosophical\nperspectives thus:\n\nThe syntactic view that a theory is an axiomatized collection\nof sentences has been challenged by the semantic view that a\ntheory is a collection of nonlinguistic models, and both are\nchallenged by the view that a theory is an amorphous entity consisting\nperhaps of sentences and models, but just as importantly of exemplars,\nproblems, standards, skills, practices and tendencies. (Savage 1990,\nvii\u2013viii)\n\n\nMormann (2007) characterizes the Syntactic and Semantic Views in\nsimilar terms, and is among the first to use the term \u201cPragmatic\nView\u201d to capture the third view (137). The three views are\nbaptized via a trichotomy from linguistics deriving from the work of\nCharles Morris, following Charles S. Peirce. In a classic exposition,\nthe logical positivist Carnap writes:\n\nIf in an investigation explicit reference is made to the speaker, or,\nto put it in more general terms, to the user of a language, then we\nassign it to the field of pragmatics. (Whether in this case\nreference to designata is made or not makes no difference for this\nclassification.) If we abstract from the user of the language and\nanalyze only the expressions and their designata, we are in the field\nof semantics. And if, finally, we abstract from the designata\nalso and analyze only the relations between the expressions, we are in\n(logical) syntax. The whole science of language, consisting\nof the three parts mentioned, is called semiotic. (1942, 9;\nsee also Carnap 1939, 3\u20135, 16)\n\n\nTo summarize, syntax concerns grammar and abstract structures;\nsemantics investigates meaning and representation; and pragmatics\nexplores use. Importantly, while no view is oblivious to the syntax,\nsemantics, or pragmatics of theory, the baptism of each is a product\nof how one of the three aspects of language is perceived to be\ndominant: theory as syntactic logical reconstruction (Syntactic View);\ntheory as semantically meaningful mathematical modeling (Semantic\nView); or theory structure as complex and as closely tied to theory\npragmatics, i.e., function and context (Pragmatic View). Each of these\nphilosophical perspectives on scientific theory will be reviewed in\nthis entry. Their relations will be briefly considered in the\nConclusion.\n",
