Life\n\nElisabeth Simmern van Pallandt, born on 26 December 1618, was the\nthird of thirteen children and eldest daughter of Frederick V, Elector\nPalatine, and Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James I of England and\nsister of Charles I. She died on 8 February 1680, in Herford, Germany,\nwhere she was abbess of the convent there.\n\nIn 1620, Frederick V, having been installed as King of Bohemia,\npromptly lost his throne in events usually taken to have precipitated\nthe Thirty Years War. In the 1620s, Elisabeth lived in Brandenburg\nwith her grandmother and aunt until the children joined their parents,\nliving in exile, in The Hague, where they were sheltered by Maurice of\nNassau, Frederick\u2019s maternal uncle. Akkerman (2021) reconstructs\nElisabeth\u2019s education at the Prinsenhof, in Leiden, largely from\nthe memoirs of Elisabeth\u2019s sister Sophie, which were transcribed\nby Leibniz. Although some of the details of Elisabeth\u2019s education\nremain sketchy, it is clear that she and her siblings were tutored in\nlanguages, including Greek, Latin, French, English and German and\nperhaps others. We can infer that Elisabeth was taught logic,\nmathematics, politics, philosophy and the sciences, and it is reported\nthat her intellectual accomplishments earned her the nickname\n\u2018La Greque\u2019 from her siblings. She also was schooled in\npainting, music and dancing, and might well have been tutored by\nConstantijn Huygens. Pal (2012) provides more detail of the\nintellectual environment of the court in The Hague.\n\nWhile her correspondence with Descartes comprises the only substantive\nextant philosophical writings of Elisabeth of which we are currently\naware, we do know of other correspondence: with John Pell, concerning\nDescartes\u2019s Geometry; exchanges with Quakers, including\nRobert Barclay, George Keith, and William Penn; and letters written\nboth by and to her concerning political and financial matters in the\nEnglish Calendar of State Papers. There is also record of a brief\nexchange with Nicholas Malebranche. She is also known to have been\nconnected to Francis Mercury van Helmont, who is reported to have been\nat her deathbed. Ebbersmeyer (2020) provides the first inventory of\nthe extant correspondence of Elisabeth, which includes not only the\ncorrespondence of which we were already aware and letters to family,\nbut also letters with intellectuals associated with her stay in\nHeidelberg, where her elder brother Charles Louis was rebuilding the\nUniversity after the Thirty Years War, including correspondence in\nwhich she circulated Descartes\u2019 mathematical letters to her. The\ncorrespondence with Descartes reveals her to have been involved with\nan appointment in mathematics to the University of Leiden,\ncontemporary discussions of astronomy (Ebbersmeyer 2018), the\ndissemination of Cartesian natural philosophy in Germany (Shapiro\n2019), as well as in negotiations on a number of matters, including\nthe imprisonment of her brother Rupert in conjunction with his efforts\naround the English Civil War, negotiations of the marriage of her\nsister Henrietta, negotiations of the Treaty of Westphalia, and the\nfinances of her family after the end of the Thirty Years War.\n\nIn 1660 Elisabeth entered the Lutheran convent at Herford, and in 1667\nshe became abbess of the convent. She seems to have been an effective\nmanager of the convent lands, but also she welcomed more marginal\nreligious sects, including the Labadists, at the request of Anna Maria\nvan Schurman (see De Baar 2021 for a discussion of the extended\nfriendship between Elisabeth and van Schurman), and Quakers, including\nPenn and Barclay.\n\nIt is worth mentioning the accomplishments of some of her siblings. As\nnoted above, her older brother Charles Louis was responsible for\nrestoring the University of Heidelberg after the Thirty Years War.\nRupert, the brother born next after her, gained fame for his chemical\nexperiments as well as for his military and entrepreneurial exploits,\nincluding the founding of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. Louise Hollandine,\na younger sister, was an accomplished painter and student of Gerritt\nvan Honthorst. Sophie, her youngest sister, became the electress of\nHanover and was renowned for her intellectual patronage, particularly\nthat of Leibniz. Sophie\u2019s daughter, Sophie-Charlotte, was tutored by\nLeibniz, and both women carried on substantive philosophical\ncorrespondence with Leibniz in which he clarified his philosophical\nviews. See Strickland (2011).\n2. Early Interest in the Passions\n\nElisabeth seems to have taken an early interest in the passions, as\nEdward Reynolds dedicated his Treatise on the passions and the\nfaculties of the soule of man (1640) to her. While there is\nlittle information about its context, the dedication suggests that\nElisabeth had seen a draft of the work, and so one can infer that they\nhad some discussion or correspondence. Reynolds\u2019s work, while one of\nthe first self-standing treatments of the passions of the period,\ndraws largely on Aristotelian-Scholastic discussions. It does,\nhowever, focus on the sensitivity of the passions to reason, and so\nour capacity to correct our errant passions through reflection.\n3. Intellectual Networks\n\nIn addition to her well-known correspondence with Descartes, discussed\nin detail below, Elisabeth also had other extensive correspondence,\nnow documented in Ebbersmeyer (2020). Through this correspondence\nscholars are beginning to gain a sense of her intellectual\nnetworks.\n\nElisabeth corresponded with a number of prominent Quakers, including\nRobert Barclay and William Penn, who visited her at the convent in\nHerford. Though both Barclay and Penn attempt to gain Elisabeth as a\nconvert, she does not seem interested in engaging them philosophically\nor theologically. Insofar as the Scottish Quakers played a strategic\nrole in the efforts to restore the throne, one can wonder whether her\nengagement with them was simply political. On the other hand,\nElisabeth\u2019s long-standing interest in emerging alternative theories,\nalong with her interest in divine providence, makes it just as\nplausible that she took a more intellectual interest in their world\nview.\n\nHutton (2021) explores Elisabeth\u2019s connections to the Quakers in\nmore detail, through her correspondence with Robert Barclay and George\nKeith, and aims to ascertain whether Elisabeth and Anne Conway knew\none another through those connections, as well as her connections with\nHenry More, the Hartlib Circle, and Francis Mercury van Helmont, De\nBaar (2021) considers Elisabeth\u2019s interest in religion more\ngenerally through her correspondence with Anna Maria van Schurman.\n\nPal (2021) focuses on Elisabeth\u2019s family correspondence, as well\nas her exchanges with Descartes and others, to argue that the\noverarching concern of Elisabeth\u2019s intellectual interests was\nthe question of how best to rule.\n\nEbbersmeyer (2021), drawing on correspondence and on dedications of\nbooks, demonstrates Elisabeth\u2019s awareness of and potential\ninvolvement in a number of areas of natural philosophy, including\nmathematics, medicine, microscopy, astronomy, and physics. Ebbersmeyer\ngoes on to explore the details of Elisabeth\u2019s interest in\nastronomy through her exchanges with Constantijn Huygens and Andreas\nColvius, and to show that Elisabeth was involved in debates about the\ndiscovery of the moons of Jupiter, emerging maps of the moon of Earth,\nand the invention of new telescopes.\n4. Correspondence with Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n\nElisabeth\u2019s correspondence with Descartes begins at her initiative in\n1643 and continues until Descartes\u2019s death in early 1650. Elisabeth\ndoes not seem to have produced any systematic philosophical work, and\nher extant philosophical writings consist almost entirely of her\ncorrespondence with Descartes. While we have Descartes\u2019s works, and\ncenturies of interpretation to contextualize his side of the exchange,\nwe do not have this larger picture in which to situate Elisabeth\u2019s\nthoughts. Thus, any account of her proper philosophical position must\nbe gleaned through interpretation. It is evident from the\ncorrespondence that Elisabeth has a remarkable and wide-ranging\ncritical philosophical acumen. Careful reading of her side of the\ncorrespondence does suggest she has some positive philosophical\ncommitments of her own, on matters including the nature of causation,\nthe nature of the mind, explanations of natural phenomena, virtue, and\ngood governance.\n4.1 Provenance\n\nWhile many of Descartes\u2019s letters to Elisabeth were published in the\nvolumes of his correspondence edited by Clerselier after his death,\nElisabeth refused Pierre Chanut\u2019s request to publish her side of the\nexchange. Elisabeth\u2019s side of the correspondence was first published\nin a volume by A. Foucher de Careil, after he was alerted to its\nexistence by an antiquarian bookseller, Frederick M\u00fcller, who had\nfound a packet of letters in Rosendael, outside Arnhem. These same\nletters are what appear in the Oeuvres of Descartes, edited\nby Charles Adam and Paul Tannery. The letters from Rosendael are not\noriginals, but rather copies that date from the early 18th century.\nWhile we do not know the provenance of the copies, the consistency of\ntheir content with that of Descartes\u2019s letters, along with allusions\nto events in Elisabeth\u2019s family and private life, argues strongly in\nfavor of the authenticity of the copies.\n4.2 Mind-Body Interaction and the Nature of Mind\n\nThe correspondence between Elisabeth and Descartes begins with\nElisabeth\u2019s asking probing questions about how Descartes can explain\nthe ability of an immaterial substance to act on a material substance.\nAt issue in this initial query is the kind of causation operating\nbetween mind and body. As Elisabeth frames the issues, existing\naccounts tie causal efficacy to extension, and in this regard it is\nsignificant that she poses her question about the mind\u2019s ability to\nact on the body, and not the body\u2019s ability to affect the mind. To\naccount for the causal efficacy of an immaterial mind, Elisabeth\nsuggests that Descartes can articulate either the account of causation\nproper to mind-body interaction or the substantial nature of the mind\nsuch that existing accounts could explain its actions. Descartes\u2019s\nresponse is not only evasive but opens up further issues, in\nparticular about whether the mind-body union is a third substance,\ninsofar as he appeals to the Scholastic notion of heaviness to address\nElisabeth\u2019s concerns (Garber 1983), and intimates there is a\ncontradiction in thinking of mind and body as both two distinct\nsubstances and as united (Mattern 1978). In addition, in his\nresponses, Descartes jumps between the two separate issues of\nmind-body and body-mind interaction (Rozemond 1999). My concern in\nthis entry is not, however, to articulate the views expressed in\nDescartes\u2019s side of the correspondence.\n\nThis exchange reveals that Elisabeth is committed to a mechanist\naccount of causation\u2014that is, one limited to efficient\ncausation. Elisabeth rejects Descartes\u2019s appeal to the Scholastic\nconception of heaviness as a model through which to explain mind-body\ninteraction, on the grounds that, as Descartes himself previously\nargued, it is unintelligible and inconsistent with a mechanist\nconception of nature. That is, she squarely rejects the formal causal\nexplanatory model underlying the Scholastic notion of a real quality,\ninsofar as she refuses to consider that model appropriate in some\ncontexts. She is nonetheless open-minded about which account of\nefficient causation ought to be adopted. This openness reveals that\nshe is apprised of debates about the nature of causation in the period\n(Gabbey 1990, Clatterbaugh 1999, Nadler 1993). Elisabeth\u2019s investment\nin the new science emerging in the seventeenth century is reflected in\nwhat she writes regarding mathematics and natural philosophy,\ndiscussed briefly in the next subsection.\n\nElisabeth\u2019s remarks to Descartes also suggest that she is willing to\nrevisit Descartes\u2019s substance dualism. She presses Descartes to\nfurther articulate his account of substance, pointing not only to the\nproblem of mind-body interaction, but also to cases where the poor\ncondition of the body\u2014the vapours, for instance\u2014affects\ncapacity for thought. These cases, she intimates, would be more\nstraightforwardly explained by considering the mind to be material and\nextended. The issue of the role of the condition of the body in our\ncapacity for thought also figures in the correspondence of 1645,\nconcerning the regulation of the passions, from both a theoretical and\na personal perspective. Elisabeth maintains that we have autonomy of\nthought\u2014that we have control over what we think and can turn our\nattention from one object to another\u2014 and so that the order of\nthought does not depend on the causal order of material things.\nHowever, at the same time she acknowledges that the capacity for\nthought, and the free will essential to it, is dependent on the\noverall condition of the body. Elisabeth thus rejects an account of\nmind that reduces thinking to bodily states, but at the same time she\ncalls into question the idea that the capacity of thinking exists\nwholly independently of body, that is, that a thinking thing is\nsubstance properly speaking. As Alanen (2021) puts it, what is at\nissue in this exchange is how to understand the agency proper to\nthought. Shapiro (1999 and 2007) suggests that while Elisabeth might\nbe willing to revisit substance dualism, she does not advocate clearly\nfor any alternative. Janssen-Lauret (2018) maintains that in the end\nElisabeth endorses substance dualism and argues that Elisabeth\nsubscribes to a naturalistic dualism, which holds that the soul is\nboth conscious and extended without endorsing materialism.\n\nInterestingly, Elisabeth introduces her own nature as female as one\nbodily \u2018condition\u2019 that can impact reason. While Descartes\nconcedes that a certain threshold of bodily health is necessary for\nthe freedom that characterizes rational thought, he disregards\nElisabeth\u2019s appeal to the \u201cweakness of my sex\u201d (Shapiro\n1999). Pellegrin (2021), in analyzing how the female body figures in\nthe correspondence between Descartes and Elisabeth, argues that the\nvery idea of a weak sex is antithetical to Cartesianism.\n4.3 Mathematics and Natural Philosophy\n\nIn letters of November 1643, shortly after the initial exchange\nconcerning the union of mind and body, Descartes sets Elisabeth the\nclassic geometrical problem of the three circles or Apollonius\u2019s\nproblem: to find a circle that touches each of three given circles on\na plane. While Elisabeth\u2019s solution is no longer available,\nDescartes\u2019s comments indicate that Elisabeth had already mastered\ntechniques of algebraic geometry. She is thought to have learned them\nfrom Johan Stampioen\u2019s textbook. Elisabeth\u2019s approach to the problem\nseems to have differed from Descartes\u2019s own, and Descartes remarks on\nher solution having a symmetry and transparency in virtue of its using\nonly a single variable that his lacked. Elisabeth\u2019s recognized\nmathematical acumen is also evidenced by her involvement in the hiring\nof Frans van Schooten to the mathematical faculty at Leiden and John\nPell\u2019s effort to enlist her help in understanding Descartes\u2019s\nGeometry.\n\nIn 1644, Descartes dedicated his Principles of Philosophy to\nElisabeth. In that work, Descartes not only presents his metaphysics\nin textbook form, he also lays out his physics in some detail.\nElisabeth responds to the dedication with gratitude, but also by\noffering criticisms of Descartes\u2019s accounts of magnetic attraction and\nthe heaviness of mercury.\n\nAlso in the correspondence, Elisabeth shows herself to have a keen\ninterest in the workings of the physical world and in efficient causal\nexplanations of natural phenomena: she criticizes Kenelm Digby\u2019s\nreading of Descartes; she requests the works of Hogelande and Regius;\nshe reports on various observed phenomena, and in particular on\ndiseases and cures, while looking for acceptable efficient causal\nexplanations of them. This commitment efficient causal explanations\nleads her to try to disseminate Cartesian physics in Germany.\n\nEbbersmeyer (2021), as noted above, demonstrates how Elisabeth\u2019s\ninterest in natural philosophy was not limited to her correspondence\nwith Descartes, and moreover, continued after Descartes\u2019s\ndeath.\n\nShapiro (2019) argues that with respect to natural philosophy,\nElisabeth ought to be understood as a Cartesian. Kambouchner (2021)\nargues that consideration of Elisabeth\u2019s views on practical and\ncivil life shows that in this respect Elisabeth is not a Cartesian,\nthough he also suggests that Descartes himself may not be a dogmatic\nCartesian either.\n4.4 The Passions and Moral Philosophy\n\nIn his letters to Elisabeth of 1645 and 1646, Descartes develops his\nmoral philosophy, and in particular, his account of virtue as being\nresolved to do that which we judge to be the best. His letters begin\nas an effort to address a persistent illness of Elisabeth, which\nDescartes diagnoses as the manifestation of a sadness, no doubt due to\nthe events of the English Civil War. As Elisabeth herself puts it, he\n\u201chas the kindness to want to cure [her] body with [her]\nsoul\u201d (AT 4:208, 24 May 1645). While they begin by reading\nSeneca\u2019s De Vita Beata, they both agree that the work is not\nsufficiently systematic, and discussion turns to Descartes\u2019s own\nviews. Once again, Elisabeth, in her letters, plays a principally\ncritical role.\n\nHer criticisms of Descartes intertwine three distinct philosophical\npositions. First, she takes up the position of Aristotelian virtue\nethics, in objecting that Descartes\u2019s very liberal account of virtue,\nwhich requires only the intention to do good, does not require that\none\u2019s good intentions are realized in actions that are actually good.\nThat is, she notes that Descartes makes virtue impervious to fortune\nor moral luck. She, however, goes beyond the canonical Aristotelian\nposition to maintain that even our ability to reason is subject to\nluck. (This position helps to illuminate her view on the nature of the\nhuman mind. See the discussion in section 3.2 above.) Elisabeth also\ntakes up a classically Stoic position, insofar as she objects to the\nway in which Descartes\u2019s account of virtue separates virtue from\ncontentment. She objects that Descartes\u2019s account of virtue allows for\nthe virtuous agent to make mistakes, and she does not see how an agent\ncan avoid regret in the face of those mistakes. Insofar we regret when\neven our best intentions go awry, we can be virtuous and fail to be\ncontent. While it is unclear whether her objection is a psychological\none or a normative one, she does maintain that achieving contentment\nrequires an \u2018infinite science\u2019 (4:289) so that we might\nknow all of the impact of our actions, and so properly evaluate them.\nWithout a faculty of reason that is already perfected, on her view,\nnot only will we not be able to achieve virtue, we also will not rest\ncontent. (See Shapiro 2012 for an interpretation of these remarks.\nPerler (2021) situates this discussion within a contemporary framework\nof internalism and externalism and argues that Elisabeth replaces\nDescartes\u2019 internalist conception of happiness with a more\ncomplex conception that takes both internal and external factors into\naccount.) On her view, not only the right use of our rational\nfaculties but also the right conditions for using them are required\nfor obtaining happiness.\n\nIn the context of this exchange, in the same letter of 13 September\n1645, Elisabeth asks Descartes to \u201cdefine the passions, in order\nto know them better\u201d (AT 4: 289). It is this request that leads\nDescartes to draft a treatise on the passions, on which Elisabeth\ncomments in her letter of 25 April 1646, and which is ultimately\npublished in 1649 as The Passions of the Soul. Elisabeth\u2019s\nconcerns about our ability to properly evaluate our actions lead her\nto express a further concern, this time about the possibility of\nmeasuring value objectively, given that we each have personal biases,\nwhether by temperament or by matters of self-interest. Without a\nproper measure of value, she implies, Descartes\u2019s account of virtue\ncannot even get off the ground, for it is not clear what should\nconstitute our best judgement of what is the best course of action.\nBehind Elisabeth\u2019s objection here is a view of ethics akin to that of\nHobbes and other contractarians, \nwhich takes the good to be a matter\nof balancing of competing self-interests.\n\nIn his letter of 15 September 1645 Descartes aims to answer some of\nher concerns by outlining a set of metaphysical truths knowledge of\nwhich will suffice in guiding our practical judgements, including that\nall things depend on God (who exists), the nature of the human mind\nand its immortality, and the vast extent of the universe (15 September\n1645; AT 4:292). Elisabeth responds by asserting that these\nconsiderations just open more problems\u2014of explaining human free\nwill, of how understanding the immortality of the soul can make us\nseek death, and of distinguishing particular providence from the idea\nof God\u2014without providing any guidance for evaluating things\nproperly. (See Schmaltz 2019 and Reuter 2021 for interpretations of\nElisabeth\u2019s view on free will and divine providence.)\n4.5 Political Philosophy\n\nElisabeth\u2019s interest in properly evaluating actions and their outcomes\nis clearly related to her position as an exiled Princess, one with\nhopes that her family will regain some of their political power. She\nis particularly concerned with the problems that rulers face making\ndecisions that stand to impact a large group of people with incomplete\ninformation. To this end, she asks Descartes to present the central\nmaxims \u201cconcerning civil life\u201d (AT 4:406, 25 April 1646),\nand for his thoughts on Machiavelli\u2019s The Prince. Descartes\npolitely refuses the former, but offers his thoughts on the latter in\nhis letter of September 1646. Elisabeth offers her own reading in her\nletter of 10 October 1646. In her view Machiavelli\u2019s focus on a state\nthat is the most difficult to govern does provide useful guidance for\nachieving stability, but affords little for how to proceed in\ngoverning a stable state. Paganani (2021) situates this exchange\nwithin the broader 17th century context, both the political\nrealities and the political philosophy, and in particular, Hobbes. He\nargues that Elisabeth took Machiavelli\u2019s realism as a starting\npoint, to begin to work through her own solution to how to resolve the\nconflicts arising from competing evaluations of self-interested\nagents, each moved by their own desires and passions, and ensure\nmutual security, peace, and insofar as possible individual well-being.\nElisabeth rejects Descartes\u2019appeal to divine guarantee, and,\nperhaps rooted in her own actual practice and public role, favours a\npragmatic and operational approach to navigating charged political\nrealities. He argues that she puts forward a distinctive position on\nthe politics of moral action, and in particular on the problem of how\nnatural law applies in a wicked world.\n\nShapiro (2021) explores a remark Elisabeth makes in her letter to\nDescartes of 4 December 1649 on the apparent incompatibility of\ngoverning and philosophizing (AT 5:452), and argues that Elisabeth\nrecognizes that rulers, and not simply their subjects, inevitably have\ntheir own passions, which must be regulated according to the demands\nof their office. These practical demands, and in particular the time\nconstraints of their decision-making, can leave a ruler with a very\ndifferent affective profile from that of the philosopher.\n\nGiven the suggestion of Pal (2021) that Elisabeth\u2019s own\ninterests centred on how to govern well, this part of her\ncorrespondence gains significance. It is reasonable to assume that\nfurther consideration on these issues informed her management of the\nconvent at Herford, and perhaps led her to find a way both to govern\nand to pursue her intellectual interests at the same time.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a id=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>", "<a id=\"SecSou\">Secondary Sources</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a id=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Barclay, Robert, 1870, <em>Reliquiae Barclaianae: Correspondence\nof Colonel David Barclay and Robert Barclay of Urie</em>, London:\nWinter &amp; Bailey, Lithograph.", "Blom, John, 1978, <em>Descartes: His Moral Philosophy and\nPsychology</em>, New York: New York University Press.
