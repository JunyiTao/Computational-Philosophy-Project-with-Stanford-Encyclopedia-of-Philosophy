Basic Features of Spinoza\u2019s Political Philosophy\n\n\nThree of the most striking and important claims of Spinoza\u2019s\nEthics are that (1) all things come to exist and act\nnecessarily from the laws of God\u2019s nature (e.g., EIP29\nand EIP33), (2) nature does not act on account of some end or\npurpose (EI Appendix), and (3) nature is everywhere and always\nthe same (EIII Preface). Collectively, these three claims\nentail that human behavior, like the behavior of everything else, is\nfully necessitated by, and explicable through, the immutable\u2014and\nnon-providential\u2014laws of God or Nature. This forms a significant\npart of the metaphysical backdrop against which Spinoza develops his\npolitical theory. For the sake of simplicity, I will call the view that\nis constituted by these three theses Spinoza\u2019s naturalism. This\nnaturalism led him to adopt bold views about the source and\nstatus of rights, obligations, and laws that distinguished his work from that of\nother seventeenth-century political theorists.\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s naturalism excludes the possibility of a transcendent God. Those\nwho believe in a transcendent God \u201cimagine that there are two\npowers, distinct from each other, the power of God and the power of\nnatural things\u2026. they imagine the power of God to be like the\nauthority of royal majesty, and the power of nature to be like a force\nand impetus\u201d (TTP 6/81). Of course, on Spinoza\u2019s account, God is\nnot a transcendent legislator, God is nature itself. Consequently, all accounts of right that are rooted in God\u2019s legislating will are specious. This is a direct rebuke not only of defenders of\nthe divine right of kings, but also of most accounts of natural rights\nas entitlements that were embraced by many seventeenth-century\ntheorists.\n\n\nMoreover, this naturalism also rules out the possibility of a normative order of things, or a way that\nthings should be, distinct from the actual order of\nthings. This undermines the teleological assumptions that form the\nbasis of natural law theory, whether Thomistic or Protestant. Even\nthose who wished to separate natural law from theology (e.g.,\nPufendorf), and those who de-emphasized the role of God\u2019s\nwill\u2014as Grotius does in his famous etiam si daremus\npassage\u2014still supposed that there is a way that things ought to\nbe, a normative natural order that can be decoupled from the actual\norder of things. According to this view, humans act contrary to nature\nwhen they act contrary to the prescriptions of right reason. Spinoza\nattacks this view, according to which \u201cthe ignorant violate the\norder of nature rather than conform to it; they think of men in nature\nas a state within a state [imperium in imperio]\u201d (TP\n2/6). The phrase \u201cimperium in imperio\u201d famously\nappears also in the preface to Ethics III, where Spinoza is\ncharacterizing the non-naturalist view that he opposes. In both of\nthese passages, Spinoza criticizes the assumption that man is governed\nby his own set of rational, normative laws, rather than the laws that\ngovern the rest of nature. It is precisely this position that Spinoza\nundercuts when he writes in the Ethics that \u201cthe laws\nand rules of Nature\u2026are always and everywhere the same\u201d\n(EIII preface) and in the TP that \u201cwhether man\nis led by reason or solely by desire, he does nothing that is not in\naccordance with the laws and rules of nature\u201d (TP 2/5).\n\n\nIn short, by adopting the view that nature is univocal and that man is\ngoverned by the same laws as everything else in nature, Spinoza\nrejects the natural law tradition (Curley 1991; A. Garrett 2003; for\ncontrasting views, see Kisner 2010 and Miller 2012). And even if\nSpinoza\u2019s naturalism is viewed as part of a larger naturalistic trend\nin Dutch political thought (Blom 1995), his disavowal of normative\nconceptions of nature and rejection of teleology indicates a clear\nbreak with tradition. To appreciate the depth and significance of\nSpinoza\u2019s naturalism, it will be helpful to compare his views on\nnatural right and obligation to Hobbes\u2019.\n",
