    "main_text": "History and Science || Re-enactment\n3.2 Re-enactment\n\nOne of the most discussed aspects of Collingwood\u2019s philosophy of\nhistory is his claim that the historical past is not retrodicted but\nre-enacted. The task of historians is not to establish that a past\nevent had to happen in the past, in a way analogous to that in which a\nscientist predicts that a solar eclipse will happen in the future, but\nto re-enact the thoughts of historical agents. Collingwood claims that\nwhen historians re-enact the thought of an historical agent, they do\nnot re-enact a thought of a similar kind but the very same thought as\nthe agent. This claim has often been regarded as counterintuitive\nbecause to say that the thought of the agent and that of the historian\nare one and the same appears to presuppose that there is only one\nrather than two numerically distinct acts of thought: that of the\nhistorian and that of the agent. Collingwood\u2019s point, however,\nis that, since what the historian re-enacts, i.e., the propositional\ncontent of thought (he refers to this simply as thought) is\ndistinct from the acts of thinking (he refers to these as\nsensations/feelings), the criterion of identity that is\nnormally applied to individuate acts of thinking does not apply to\nthought (IH 1993: 287). Acts of thinking are individuated and\ndistinguished from one another by adopting spatial criteria. By\ncontrast thoughts (i.e., propositional contents) are individuated on\nthe basis of purely qualitative criteria, so that if there are two\npeople entertaining the (qualitatively) same thought, there is\n(numerically) only one thought since there is only one propositional\ncontent. For Collingwood, if Jane and Jim recite the practical\nsyllogism \u201cAll men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore\nSocrates is mortal\u201d they entertain one and the same thought. By\nthe same token, a historian who re-enacts the thought of a past agent\nentertains the very same thought as the historical agent:\n\n\n\u2026 in its immediacy, as an actual experience of his own,\nPlato\u2019s argument must undoubtedly have grown up out of a\ndiscussion of some sort, though I do not know what it was, and been\nclosely connected to such a discussion. Yet if I not only read his\nargument but understand it, follow it in my own mind re-enacting it\nwith and for myself, the process of argument which I go through is not\na process resembling Plato\u2019s, it is actually Plato\u2019s so\nfar as I understand him correctly. (IH 1993: 301)\n\n\nAs the last clause in the quotation makes clear, Collingwood\u2019s\naccount of re-enactment aims to establish a conceptual point about\nwhat exactly it is that historians re-enact (the thought as opposed to\nthe acts of thinking) and what the criteria for identifying and\ndistinguishing thoughts are. It is not meant to prescribe to\nhistorians an empathetic method for the recovery of inner\npsychological processes which are not accessible from a third person\nperspective (Saari 1984 and 1989; Van der Dussen 1981 and 1995;\nD\u2019Oro 2000). Unfortunately the doctrine of re-enactment has been\nwidely read not as attempting to identify the subject matter of\nhistory (thought, rather than acts of thinking), but as seeking to\narticulate a method by which historian can recover hidden\npsychological processes that are not accessible from the third person\nperspective. In the aftermath of the publication of The Idea of\nHistory, the re-enactment doctrine was widely associated with\nDilthey\u2019s account of empathetic understanding and accused of\nascribing to the historian implausible telepathic powers of access to\nother minds (Gardiner 1952a and 1952b).\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment could be criticised for\nover-rationalizing the subject matter of history. His identification\nof the object of re-enactment with \u201cthought\u201d, and of\nhistory as a criteriological or normative inquiry into thought, to the\nexclusion of \u201cfeelings\u201d or \u201csensations\u201d, might\nseem too restrictive since a great deal of action is not rational, and\nirrationality has been the driving force behind much that has happened\nin history. When considering this objection, one must bear in mind\nthat \u201chistory\u201d understood as a form of inquiry distinct\nfrom natural science should not be conflated with\n\u201chistory\u201d as an academic discipline practised in\nuniversity departments. Practising historians will inevitably be\nconcerned with much more than \u201cthought\u201d and the specific\nnorms by which past agents led their lives. They will inevitably\nmention irrational factors, just as they mention arational natural\nforces (earthquakes, floods and other natural phenomena that impact on\nhistorical agents). Collingwood\u2019s goal was not to tell\nhistorians what they can and cannot say about what happened in the\npast, but to distinguish between two very different ways in which the\npast can be approached: under the assumption of the uniformity of\nnature and under the assumption that the deeds of historical agents\nare responses to norms rather than instances of natural laws.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment certainly implies that the\nhistorical past is in principle knowable, that it is possible to\nmediate reality through the conceptual framework, for example, of the\nancient Egyptians or the ancient Greeks. This is not to say that the\npast can be known in itself, or independently of any conceptual\nmediation, but that it can be seen from the perspective of past\nagents, through the categorial framework that mediated their\nconception of reality. While there are additional epistemic obstacles\nin the way of understanding agents from a distant past, agents who we\ncannot engage in a live conversation, knowledge of the past is in\nprinciple achievable because understanding past agents is not a\nradically different task from that of understanding the thoughts of\nour contemporaries. Historical knowledge, Collingwood says\n\n\nis not concerned only with a remote past. It is by historical thinking\nthat we re-think and so rediscover the thoughts of Hammurabi or Solon,\nit is in the same way that we discover the thought of a friend who\nwrites us a letter, or a friend who crosses the street. (IH 1993:\n219)\n\n\nIn so far as Collingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment defends the\npossibility of knowing the past as it always was for historical agents\n(the historian, as we have seen, seeks to establish what crossing the\nRubicon meant to a Roman cognizant of Republican law) it goes against\na view that became dominant in the latter part of the twentieth\ncentury, according to which the past cannot be known as it always was\nbecause it is constantly and necessarily revised from the perspective\nof the present. This view was endorsed with varying degrees of\nemphasis in the philosophical hermeneutics of H-G. Gadamer, in the\nphilosophy of history, and the philosophy of language. Gadamer\u2019s\nphilosophical hermeneutics claimed that the past \u201cis understood\nonly if it is understood in a different way every time\u201d (1960\n[1975: 275]) because the meaning of a text is the result of a fusion\nof the horizons of the text to be interpreted and the horizon of the\ninterpreter. In the philosophy of history narrativists such as Hayden\nWhite (1973), Frank Ankersmit (1983) and Keith Jenkins (1991)\nemphasised the cultural endowment of the historian as the lens through\nwhich the past is accessed. Even the philosophy of language was not\nimmune from this trend. Quine (1960) famously denied that it is\npossible to achieve determinacy in translation in direct opposition to\nCollingwood\u2019s claim that it is at least in principle possible to\nre-enact the very same thought as the historical agent. This\nrevisionary view of the past goes against Collingwood\u2019s\nconception of what it means to understand the past historically. The\ntask of the historian, as he saw it, is to transport us to another\nworld by immersing oneself in the historical agent\u2019s own context\nof thought.\n",
