We can add a notion of the number of a class to\nallow for a direct comparison with Frege:  \n\n\\[\\# \\{x \\mid \\phi ( x) \\} \\eqdf  \\{ y \\mid  y \\approx \\{x \\mid  \\phi (x) \\} \\}.\\] \n\n\n(In set theory of course this is too large to be a set, and so is just\na \u201cproper class\u201d.)\nHume\u2019s Principle in PM\n\nHume\u2019s Principle which is described in Frege (1884:\n\u00a763) as asserting that the content of the proposition that\n\u201cthe number which belongs to the concept F is the same as the\nnumber which belongs to the concept G\u201d is equivalent to\n\u201cthe concept F is similar to the concept G\u201d. In terms of\nclasses this becomes \\(\\alpha \\approx \\beta \\equiv \\# \\alpha = \\#\n\\beta\\). Hume\u2019s principle is the focus of much of the discussion\nof \u201cNeo-Logicism\u201d, the doctrine that Frege\u2019s\nconstruction of the numbers can be built on a consistent foundation\n(see the entry on \n Frege\u2019s theorem).\n\nOnly one direction of this equivalence is provable in PM:\n\n\\[\n\\tag*{\u2217100\u00b7321}\n\\alpha \\approx \\beta   \\supset   \\# \\alpha = \\# \\beta\n\\]\n\n\nThe failure of the other direction, the implication from right to\nleft, is due to the possibility that \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are of\ndifferent types, so that any similarity relation between them will\nhave its domain and range in different types. Suppose there are\n\\(\\aleph_0\\) individuals, and consider two higher types with the\ncardinals in them of even larger, but distinct, cardinalities, say\n\\(\\alpha\\) in some high type has cardinality \\(\\aleph_1\\) and that\n\\(\\beta\\) in an even higher type and has cardinality \\(\\aleph_2\\).\nThere are no sets of individuals similar to \\(\\alpha\\) or \\(\\beta\\),\nso no similarity relation with a domain in \\(\\alpha\\) or \\(\\beta\\)\nwill hold with respect to any set in the type of individuals. Suppose\nthat \\(\\#\\) is defined in terms of such descending relation.\nTherefore \\(\\# \\alpha = \\{ \\Lambda \\} = 0\\) and \\(\\# \\beta = \\{\n\\Lambda \\} = 0\\) so \\(\\# \\alpha = \\# \\beta\\), yet \\(\\alpha \\not\\approx\n\\beta\\) on any similarity relation of whatever domain and range,\nbecause their cardinalities differ. Whitehead and Russell assert that\nthe case of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) being in different types is the\nonly way to construct an exception to this direction of Hume\u2019s\nprinciple, and offer as a restricted version: \n\n\\[\n\\tag*{\u2217100\u00b734}\n\\exists \\gamma   [\\gamma \\in (\\alpha \\cap \\beta) ]  \\supset   ( \\alpha \\approx \\beta   \\equiv   \\# \\alpha = \\# \\beta )\n\\]\n\n\nThe antecedent guarantees that \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are of the\nsame type, and so the cardinal numbers involved are homogenous\ncardinals. (Landini (2016) argues that this section of PM is\nconfused.)\n0 Defined \n\n\\[\n\\tag*{\u2217101\u00b71} 0 \\eqdf  \\# \\emptyset\n\\]\n\n\nThe class of all classes equinumerous with the empty set is just the\nsingleton containing the empty set, so \\(0 = \\{ \\emptyset \\}\\).\nThe Arithmetical Sum of Classes and Cardinals \n\n\\[\n\\tag*{\u2217110\u00b701}  \n\\alpha + \\beta \\eqdf  [\\{ \\beta \\cap \\emptyset \\}  \\times \\{\\alpha \\}]   \\cup    [ \\{ \\alpha \\times \\{ \\beta \\} ] \n\\] \n\n\n(If \\( \\alpha, \\beta \\neq \\emptyset \\) , otherwise \\( \\alpha +\n\\emptyset = \\alpha, \\emptyset + \\beta = \\beta \\) ). This qualification\nis hidden in PM by the use of expressions for functional relations\nthat are sometimes undefined.  The arithmetic sum of\n\\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) is the union of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\)\nafter they are made disjoint by summing the pairing the elements of\n\\(\\beta\\) with elements of \\(\\{ \\alpha \\}\\) and the elements of\n\\(\\alpha\\) with the elements of \\(\\{ \\beta \\}\\). (The Cartesian\nproduct of \\( \\gamma \\) and \\( \\delta \\), \\( \\gamma \\times \\delta\n\\) is \\( \\{ \\langle x, y \\rangle | x \\in \\gamma \\; \\amp \\; y \\in\n\\delta \\} \\)). The The classes \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are\nintersected with the empty class, \\(\\emptyset\\), to adjust the type of\nthe elements of the sum. It is more recognizable to contemporary set\ntheory by the equivalent definition (subject to the same exception\nwhen\n\n\n:  \n\n\\[\\alpha + \\beta \\eqdf  \\{ \\langle \\emptyset, x \\rangle | x \\in \\alpha \\}  \\cup    \\{ \\langle y, \\emptyset \\rangle | y \\in \\beta \\} \\]\n\n\nThe cardinal sum of y and x \n\n\\[\n\\tag*{\u2217110\u00b702}\n{}\\quad y +_c x = \\{ z   \\mid    \\exists \\alpha   \\exists \\beta [( y = \\# \\alpha \\amp  x = \\# \\beta) \\amp   z \\approx \\alpha + \\beta ] \\} \n\\]\n\n\n\\(y +_c x\\) expresses the cardinal addition of cardinals\ny and x. It is the arithmetical sum of\n\u201chomogeneous cardinals\u201d, cardinals of a uniform type, to\nwhich \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are related by \\(\\rN_0 c\\) (itself\ndefined at [\u2217103\u00b701]). The notation indicating that\n\\(\\alpha\\) is a homogenous cardinal \\(\\alpha\\) is \\(\\rN_0\nc\\pmsq\\alpha\\), which we might write as \\(\\#_0\\) in an extension of\nour contemporary notation replacing \\(\\#\\) above.\n\nThe reader can now appreciate the notorious fact that \\(1 +1=2\\), the\nmost elementary truth of arithmetic, is not proved until page 83 of\nVolume II of Principia Mathematica, and even then, almost as\nan afterthought: \n\n\\[\n\\tag*{\u2217110\u00b7643} 1 +_c 1 = 2\n\\]\n\n\nWhitehead and Russell remark that \u201cThe above proposition is\noccasionally useful. It is used at least three times,\nin\u2026\u201d. This witticism reminds us that the theory of\nnatural numbers, so central to Frege\u2019s works, appears in PM as\nonly a special case of a general theory of cardinal and ordinal\nnumbers and even more general classes of isomorphic structures.\nExponentiation\n\nExponentiation for cardinals is defined in such a way that it\ncoincides with Cantor\u2019s notion that the cardinality of the\npowerset of a class \\(\\alpha\\) is 2 raised to the power of the\ncardinality of \\(\\alpha\\): \n\n\\[\n\\tag*{\u2217116\u00b772}\n\\lvert\\lvert \\wp \\alpha \\rvert\\rvert  = 2^{\\lvert\\lvert  \\alpha \\rvert\\rvert }\n\\]\n\nGreater and Less\n\nCantor\u2019s Theorem: \n\n\\[\n\\tag*{\u2217117\u00b7661} 2^{y} > y\n\\]\n\n\nThis is Cantor\u2019s theorem that the if a set \\(\\alpha\\) has a\ncardinal number y then the cardinal number \\(2^{y}\\) of the\npowerset of \\(\\alpha\\) is greater than y.\nThe Natural Numbers\n\nThe most direct comparison with Frege\u2019s development of the\nnatural numbers comes with the notion of Inductive Cardinal\nby which PM means the natural numbers 0, 1, 2,\u2026, and the theory\nof these numbers including the principle of induction. Although the\nnumbers 0 and 1, as well as addition of natural numbers \\(+_c\\) is has\nbeen defined earlier, they are defined as cardinal numbers and\naddition will apply to all cardinal numbers, finite and transfinite.\nFor the finite natural numbers, special notions need to be defined\nfirst. For the proof of the Peano Postulates it is necessary not only\nto define 0, but also the notion of successor. For Frege the\nnotion of (weak) predecessor of a number is defined, thus 0 and 1 are\nthe predecessors of 1, while 0, 1 and 2 are the predecessors of 2,\netc. The successor of n is then defined by counting the\npredecessors of a number, in terms of the definition of number, it is\nthe number of the class of predecessors. This definition would not\nwork for PM, where each number would be of a higher type, as it is\ndefined as a set containing that number. There will in fact be natural\nnumbers for each type, thus a set of all pairs of individuals of type\n0, a set of pairs of sets of type 1, etc., for each type. There is no\none type, however, at which there are all of the natural numbers (sets\nof equinumerous sets of that type) without an assumption that there\nare infinitely many members of some one type.\n\nThe solution in PM is to guarantee that for each finite set of\nn individuals of type 0, there will be some object not in that\nset, which can be included in the set defining the successor. That such a\nnew individual can be found is guaranteed by the Axiom of Infinity,\nwhich in effect asserts the existence of distinct individuals of any\nfinite number. It is interesting to note the the \u201cAxiom\u201d\nof Infinity is not a primitive proposition of the logic of\nPM. Instead it is an additional hypothesis, to be used as an\nantecedent to mathematical assertions upon which it depends. The issue\nof whether the system of PM succeeds as logicism is thus not\nsettled by noting that an Axiom of Infinity has to be assumed, but by\ndetermining whether that \u201cAxiom\u201d is derivable from logical\nprinciples alone.\n\nIn axiomatic set theory the \u201cAxiom of Infinity\u201d guarantees\nthe existence of a particular set, the ordinal \\(\\omega\\):\n\n \\[\n\\exists x [ \\emptyset   \\in   x \\amp  \\forall y ( y   \\in   x \\supset y \\cup \\{ y\\}   \\in   x ) ]\n\\]\n\n\nThe inductive cardinals (natural numbers) are defined as the\nnumbers bearing the ancestral of the \\(+_1\\) relation to 0. Given that\nthe \\(+_1\\) relation is the PM account of successor this is\nthe same definition as for Frege.\n\nInductive Cardinals N \n\n\\[\n\\tag*{\u2217120\u00b701}\n\\rN  \\eqdf  \\{x\\mid  0 \\relSast x \\}\n\\]\n\n\nThe inductive cardinals N are the familiar natural\nnumbers, namely 0 and all those cardinal numbers that are related\nto 0 by the ancestral of the \u201csuccessor relation\u201d\nS, where \\(x\\relS y\\) just in case \\(y = x +1\\). \n\n\\[\n\\tag*{\u2217120\u00b703}\n\\textrm{Axiom of Infinity} \\eqdf    \\forall y ( y \\in  \\{x\\mid  0\\relSast x \\} \\supset y \\neq \\emptyset )\n\\]\n\n\nThis Axiom of Infinity asserts that all inductive cardinals are\nnon-empty. (Recall that \\(0 = \\{\\emptyset \\}\\), and so 0 is not\nempty.) The axiom is not a \u201cprimitive proposition\u201d but\ninstead to be listed as an \u201chypothesis\u201d where used, that\nis as the antecedent of a conditional, where the consequent will be\nsaid to depend on the axiom. Technically is not an axiom of\nPM as \u2217120\u00b703 is a definition, so this is just\nfurther defined notation in PM!\n\nWhitehead and Russell do carry out the step of the logicist program of\nderiving Peano\u2019s Postulates based on the prior definitions of\nthe notions of Natural number, 0, and successor, as Russell describes\nthe project later, in (1919). This is in fact what is done in\n\u2217120 \u201cInductive Cardinals\u201d of PM, but\nis not described as such, either there or in introductory material.\nThe results are not proved separately, but as they appear in a\ndevelopment of various results about natural numbers. Indeed some, such as \u2217120\u00b731, can only be seen to be versions of a Peano axiom with a bit of work.\n\n0 is a natural number. \n\n  \\[\n  \\tag*{\u2217120\u00b712} 0   \\in  \\rN\n  \\]\n\n \nThe successor of any number is a number. \n\n  \\[\n  \\tag*{\u2217120\u00b7121} n   \\in \\rN \\supset n +_c 1   \\in  \\rN\n  \\]\n\n \nNo two numbers have the same successor (assuming the axiom of\nInfinity). \n\n  \\[\n  \\tag*{\u2217120\u00b731}\n\n\\  \\textrm{Axiom of Infinity} \\supset (n +_{c} 1 = m +_{c} 1 \\supset n = m)\n  \\]\n Given the way that the successor\noperation is defined, it is not a matter of logic that there is an\nextra individual to add to a set of size n to give one of size\n\\(n +_{c} 1\\). This is guaranteed by adding the Axiom of Infinity as\nan hypothesis to the theorem.\n0 is not the successor of any number. \n\n  \\[\n  \\tag*{\u2217120\u00b7124} n +_{c} 1 \\neq 0\n  \\]\nAny property \\(\\phi\\) which belongs to 0, and belongs to the\nsuccessor of m provided that it belongs to m, belongs to\nall natural numbers n. \n\n  \\[\n  \\tag*{\u2217120\u00b713}\n  \\forall n \\{ [ n   \\in  \\rN \\; \\amp  \\; \\forall m( \\phi m \\supset \\phi (m +_c 1)) \\;  \\amp \\; \\phi    \\: 0] \\supset \\phi n \\}\n  \\]\n\n \n\n\nIn contemporary set theory the notion of the successor of a number is\ndefined directly for the ordinals as \\(s(x) =  x \\cup \\{x \\} \\)\nrather than by adding 1, and addition is defined using the familiar\nrecursive definition: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx + 0 & = x\\\\\nx + s(y) & = s (x + y)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThe use of recursive definitions is justified by a theorem proving\nthat they describe a unique function. The induction axiom is justified\nby showing that any class that contains 0, and for any number n\ncontains \\(s(n)\\) will contain all of the numbers in \\(\\omega\\). The\nexistence of \\(\\omega\\) is guaranteed by the ZF axiom of infinity.\n\nAt this point, after 225 pages in Volume II, the reader will see how\nto compare the logicist reduction of arithmetic in PM with rival\naccounts of Frege and of contemporary set theory.\n\nFrege completes his development of the natural numbers at page 68 of the Volume II of his\nBasic Laws of Arithmetic published in 1903, which follows the\n250 pages of Volume I that had been published in 1893. So both Frege\nand the authors of PM took great pains to prove more advanced theorems\nonly after a chain of closely argued lemmas based on their own\nformalized symbolic logic.\n\nFrege ends his deductions of the laws of arithemtic with results about\nthe notions of 0, Successor, and the principle of Induction which\ninclude the Peano Axioms. He does not consider arithmetical functions,\nsuch as addition or multiplication, and thus does not define the\nsuccessor of a number n as the result of adding 1 to\nn.\n\nFrege\u2019s account is streamlined in other ways as well. He had\nalways considered the analysis of simple identity sentences to be\nimportant to his logicism, dating back to the Begriffsschrift\n(1879), on through his Foundations of Arithmetic (1884) and\nhis \u201cOn Sense and Reference\u201d (1892), and even in the\nappearance of the example \u201c\\(2^2 = 2 + 2\\)\u201d in the forward\nto the Basic Laws of Arithmetic. Indeed the analysis of\nidentity sentences is the starting point of his introduction of the\ntheory of sense and reference in 1879,\nyet Frege does not diverge from\nhis project enough to show how such an identity would be proved. So\nWhitehead and Russell might well have wanted to include their proof of\n\\(1+1 = 2\\) at \u2217110\u00b7643 as a reminder of\nthe analysis of mathematical equations in PM using the\n\u201cdescriptive functions\u201d of \u221730 and\nthen the account of definite descriptions in\n\u221714.\n\nFrege also does not construct the general theory of the arithmetic of\ncardinal and ordinal numbers that occupies PM for much of Part III.\nIndeed, after the theorems on Arithmetic in \u00a754 which concludes\nPart II of Basic Laws of Arithmetic, Frege jumps directly to\nthe topic of Real Numbers for the remainder of Volume II. Judging\nsimply on the amount of theorems that had to be proved in leading to\nthe account of Peano Arithmetic, PM does not differ wildly from\nFrege\u2019s earlier attempt.\n\nAdmittedly the system of PM is an indirect and cumbersome system to\ndevelop if the theory of Arithmetic were the only goal in mind.\nFirstly, however, the system of the ramified theory of types is\nindependently interesting for the foundations of logic that it\nprovides. After \u221720 the theory of classes, and\ndevelopment of general notions of arithmetic for relations which\nfollows, does present the arithmetic of the natural numbers as a\nspecial case which can be generalized to the arithmetic of ordinal and\ncardinal numbers all in a logic with a simple hierarcy of types. The\nsurvey below of what follows in Volume II and Volume III shows the\nparticular way of developing the theory of rational and then real\nnumbers that PM follows. The results in set theory will seem\nprimitive, as the results are dated to around 1908, at just the point\nwhen axiomatic set theory began its extraordinary development.\nWhitehead and Russell were not active contributors to set theory and\nso PM should not be studied for later technical results that may have\nbeen anticipated here. Russell summarized results in PM from the\ncurrent state of the study of infinite cardinals and ordinals in a\npaper he give in Paris in a paper called \u201cOn the Axioms of the\nInfinite and Transfinite\u201d (Russell 1911). There is, however, one\nresult concerning two notions of infinity that appears to originate\nwith PM.\nDedekind Infinity\n\nIn PM a class is a finite \u201cinductive\u201d class if\nand only if it can be put into a one to one correspondence with the\nNatural Numbers less than or equal to some natural number \\(n\\). It will\nbe infinite if and only if it is not inductive.\n\nA class is Dedekind Infinite (Reflexive) if and only\nif it can be put in a one to one correspondence with a proper subset\nof itself.\n\nThe key theorem in this section is: \n\n\\[\n\\tag*{\u2217124\u00b757}\n\\textrm{If } y \\textrm{ is not inductive then } 2^{2^y} \\textrm{ is reflexive.}\n\\]\n\n\nThe Inductive and Reflexive notions of infinity coincide if one\nassumes that axiom of Choice. This result does not assume the axiom of\nChoice.\n\nGeorge Boolos (1994: 27) describes the details of this argument and\nquotes J.R. Littlewood as saying:\n\n\nHe [Russell] has a secret craving to have proved some\nstraight mathematical theorem. As a matter of fact there is\none: \u201c\\(2^{2^{\\alpha}} > \\aleph_0\\) if \\(\\alpha\\) is\ninfinite\u201d. Perfectly good mathematics.\n\n\nAs use of the Axiom of Choice is explicitly indicated, and many\nresults do not use it, the unique contribution to set theory of PM may\nbe in its indication of what can be proved without assuming\nChoice.\n",
