Conscious experience presents us with a world of objects\nindependently existing in space and time. Those objects are typically\npresent to us in a multi-modal fashion that involves the integration of\ninformation from various sensory channels as well as from background\nknowledge and memory. Conscious experience presents us not with\nisolated properties or features but with objects and events situated in\nan ongoing independent world, and it does so by embodying in its\nexperiential organization and dynamics the dense network of relations\nand interconnections that collectively constitute the meaningful\nstructure of a world of objects (Kant 1787, Husserl 1913, Campbell\n1997).\n\n\nOf course, not all sensory information need be experienced to have\nan adaptive effect on behavior. Adaptive non-experiential sensory-motor\nlinks can be found both in simple organisms, as well as in some of the\nmore direct and reflexive processes of higher organisms. But when\nexperience is present, it provides a more unified and integrated\nrepresentation of reality, one that typically allows for more\nopen-ended avenues of response (Lorenz 1977). Consider for example the\nrepresentation of space in an organism whose sensory input channels are\nsimply linked to movement or to the orientation of a few fixed\nmechanisms such as those for feeding or grabbing prey, and compare it\nwith that in an organism capable of using its spatial information for\nflexible navigation of its environment and for whatever other spatially\nrelevant aims or goals it may have, as when a person visually scans her\noffice or her kitchen (Gallistel 1990).\n\n\nIt is representation of this latter sort that is typically made\navailable by the integrated mode of presentation associated with\nconscious experience. The unity of experienced space is just one\nexample of the sort of integration associated with our conscious\nawareness of an objective world. (See the entry on\n unity of consciousness.)\n\nThis integrative role or value is most directly associated with access\nconsciousness, but also clearly with the larger phenomenal and\nintentional structure of experience. It is relevant even to the\nqualitative aspect of consciousness in so far as qualia play an\nimportant role in our experience of unified objects in a unified space\nor scene.  It is intimately tied as well to the transparency of\nexperience described in response to the What question, especially to\nsemantic transparency (Van Gulick 1993). Integration of information\nplays a major role in several current neuro-cognitive theories of\nconsciousness especially Global Workspace theories (see section 9.5)\nand Giulio Tononi's Integrated Information theory (section 9.6\nbelow).\n",
