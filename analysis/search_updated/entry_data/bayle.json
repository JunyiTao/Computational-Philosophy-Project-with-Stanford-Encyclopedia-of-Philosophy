    "preamble": "\n\nPierre Bayle (1647\u20131706), the \u201cPhilosopher of\nRotterdam\u201d, was a historian, literary critic, journalist,\nencyclopedist, French Protestant refugee, professor, and above all,\nphilosopher. Although he is usually grouped today among the\n\u201cminor figures\u201d in the history of philosophy, Bayle was\nconsidered by the leading philosophers of his day as an equal, as one\nof the most erudite authors of his or any century. Upon Bayle\u2019s\ndeath, G.W. Leibniz wrote: \u201che has departed from us, and such a\nloss is no small one, a writer whose learning and acumen few have\nequalled\u201d (1710 [1952]: 68). The Preface to the\nTheodicy makes clear that it was Bayle who motivated Leibniz\nto write the only book he ever saw fit to publish. While Leibniz\nsought mainly to refute Bayle in that work, the next century of\nEnlightenment philosophes found inspiration in Bayle\u2019s\nvast oeuvre. Bayle\u2019s six-million word Historical and\nCritical Dictionary (1697; 1702) was so often cited in the\neighteenth century that Ernst Cassirer has called it the\n\u201cArsenal of the Enlightenment\u201d. Inventories of private\nEuropean libraries have established the Dictionary as one of\nthe bestsellers of its age. David Hume was clearly influenced by it;\nhe told his friend Michael Ramsay in a letter of 1737 that if he\nwished to understand his writings he should read Descartes,\nMalebranche, Berkeley, and \u201csome of the more metaphysical\nArticles of Bailes Dictionary; such as [those of] Zeno and\nSpinoza\u201d (Hume 2007: 203\u2013204).\n\nBayle made numerous positive contributions to the history of\nphilosophy, such as arguments for the possibility of a virtuous\natheist; for the possibility of a society of atheists that is morally\nsuperior to a society of Christians; for religious toleration; and for\nthe widest possible freedom of conscience. But Bayle is usually\nremembered for the destructive force of his reasoning. In the sixth\nchapter of his Holy Family (1845), Karl Marx claimed that\nBayle\n\n\nwas driven by religious doubt to doubt about metaphysics which was the\nsupport of that faith. He therefore critically investigated\nmetaphysics from its very origin. He became its historian in order to\nwrite the history of its death. He mainly refuted Spinoza and\nLeibniz (1845 [1956]: 171).\n\n\nRichard Popkin found in Bayle\u2019s writings the culmination of the\nskeptical crisis in early modernity, calling Bayle a\n\u201csuperskeptic\u201d (2003: 283) and crediting him with\nundermining the leading philosophical systems of his day. And Jonathan\nIsrael gives partial credit for the origin of the Radical\nEnlightenment to Bayle\u2019s critiques of tradition, superstitious,\nreligion, and authority.\n\nHowever, not all of Bayle\u2019s readers would agree with these\nradical interpretations. The twentieth century\u2019s most\ninfluential Bayle scholar, Elisabeth Labrousse, read as deeply into\nBayle\u2019s writings as anyone, and found therein the signs of a\nsincere, and at times traditional, Calvinist Christian. Other\ncontemporary Bayle scholars, notably Jean-Luc Sol\u00e8re, have\ntraced the core of some of Bayle\u2019s most \u201cmodern\u201d\ndoctrines, such as his universal freedom of conscience and religious\ntoleration, back to traditional Medieval philosophical notions of\nconscience and its rights. Contradictory interpretations of\nBayle\u2019s writings flourished in his day and have continued to\nappear in every century since his death, leaving historians of\nphilosophy with the problem of the \u201cBayle enigma\u201d.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nPierre Bayle was born on the 18th of November, 1647, in Le\nCarla (now Carla-Bayle), in the south of France. The Bayles were\nHuguenots (French Protestants), and Pierre\u2019s father Jean was the\nminister of Carla. Although Jean and his wife Jane de Brugui\u00e8re\ndescended from good families, they were poor. Pierre had two brothers,\nJacob his senior and Joseph his junior, and he had to wait for the\nformer to complete his studies at the Protestant Academy of Puylaurens\nbefore the family could afford to send the next son to school. So, to\nhis lifelong chagrin, Bayle did not start his formal education until\naround the age of twenty.\n\nDespite his lack of early formal training, Bayle flourished but also\ngrew bored at the Protestant Academy. He would complete the work\nassigned, and then in his leisure time delve into the writings of\nPlutarch and Montaigne, his favourite authors. Puylaurens could not\nsatisfy his desire to compensate for what he perceived as a wasted\nyouth, so Bayle set his sights on the nearby Jesuit university in\nToulouse, one of the best schools in France. He enrolled there at the\nage of twenty-one, and soon thereafter converted to Catholicism. This\nwas not required of Bayle; many Protestants studied at Jesuit\nuniversities. The conversion seems to have been sincere, the logical\nconsequence in Bayle\u2019s mind of losing so many theological\ndebates to Catholics upon arriving in Toulouse. This conversion was\nconsidered a great acquisition by the Church; when Bayle defended his\nmaster\u2019s theses, the most distinguished people in the city\nattended and celebrated his (and their) achievement. But their pride\nwould be short-lived. Bayle\u2019s debate skills apparently improved\nat Toulouse and he found replies to the Catholic objections that had\nonce embarrassed him. He abjured the Catholic faith mere days after\ncompleting his studies. This made Bayle a \u201crelapse\u201d, and\nrendered him subject to severe penalties in France. He therefore fled\nto Geneva, where he took up the mind-numbing work of tutoring.\n\nIn 1675, Bayle cautiously returned to France to take up a more\nstimulating post as Professor of Philosophy at the Protestant Academy\nof Sedan, a position he owed in part to the support of Pierre Jurieu,\nwho was Professor of Divinity. Bayle labored day and night to compose\nhis System of Philosophy (OD IV: 199\u2013520), the course in\nLogic, Ethics, Metaphysics, and Physics that Bayle delivered to his\nstudents in Sedan. The course is traditional in its structure, but\ncontains some content that foreshadows aspects of Bayle\u2019s later\ndistinctive thought. However, Bayle\u2019s first original\nphilosophical work is his 1679 Objections to Pierre\nPoiret\u2019s Rational Thoughts on God, the Soul, and\nEvil (OD IV: 146\u2013161). In his Objections, Bayle engages\nfor the first time with the issue that would dominate much of his\ncareer: the intractability of the problem of evil.\n\nThe Edict of Nantes, which had guaranteed some limited freedom of\nreligion to Protestants in France since 1598, was not formally revoked\nby Louis XIV until 1685, but it was undermined by the Sun King\nrepeatedly for years before the Revocation. One strategy for\npersecuting Protestants involved closing their Academies. Louis XIV\nstarted with Sedan, dissolving it by formal decree in 1681, leaving\nBayle and Jurieu out of work. Both fled to Rotterdam where the city\nestablished an \u201cIllustrious School\u201d for them. Shortly\nafter arriving in Rotterdam, Bayle published the first edition of the\nwork that would eventually be known as his Various Thoughts on the\nOccasion of a Comet (Pens\u00e9es diverses sur la\ncom\u00e8te; OD III: 3\u2013160), which attacks superstition and\nproposes the possibilities of a virtuous atheist and a society of\natheists. Like nearly all of his works, it was published\npseudonymously, but soon it was known widely that Bayle was its\nauthor, and he earned the moniker, \u201cPhilosopher of\nRotterdam\u201d. Initially, Jurieu praised the work; years later, he\nwould use its arguments on behalf of virtuous atheists as the basis\nfor accusing Bayle himself of atheism.\n\nAs the situation of Protestants in France worsened, Bayle focused his\nliterary efforts on attacking religious intolerance and developing\narguments for freedom of conscience and toleration. His major works on\nthese topics are the General Critique of Maimbourg\u2019s History\nof Calvinism (1682; OD II: 1\u2013160); New Letters by the Author\nof the General Critique of Maimbourg\u2019s History of Calvinism\n(1685; OD II: 161\u2013335); The Condition of Wholly Catholic France\nunder Louis the Great (1686; OD II: 336\u2013354); and his\nmasterpiece, A Philosophical Commentary on These Words of Jesus\nChrist: Compel Them to Enter (1686\u201388; OD II: 355\u2013444). The\nKing himself ordered the first of these works to be burned. In 1685,\nBayle\u2019s older brother Jacob was imprisoned on account of this\nsame work, since the French authorities could not find Pierre. Soon\nthereafter, Bayle\u2019s father died of natural causes, then Jacob\ndied in his prison cell from its poor conditions. Bayle learned of all\nof this around the same time he learned of the Revocation. Many Bayle\nscholars note a shift in tone and focus in Bayle\u2019s works before\nand after this crisis year of 1685; some believe he lost all faith in\nGod in these dire months.\n\nThe last twenty years of Bayle\u2019s biography are indistinguishable\nfrom his bibliography. He wrote and published literally millions of\nwords on nearly every philosophical topic. His international\nreputation was secured early in this period by the establishment of\nhis journal of literary criticism, one of the first of its kinds, the\nNews from the Republic of Letters (Nouvelles de la\nr\u00e9publique des lettres; OD I: 1\u2013760), which he edited, and\nauthored nearly single-handedly, from 1684\u20131687. But just as\nBayle\u2019s star was rising, his once friend and soon-to-be enemy\nJurieu did everything in his power to eclipse it. The late 1680s and\nearly 1690s saw Bayle embroiled in bitter disputes with the jealous\nand vindictive Jurieu, whose accusations ultimately led to the\nsuppression of Bayle\u2019s Chair at the Illustrious School in\n1693.\n\nBayle\u2019s freedom from the burden of teaching threatened his\nfinancial security but allowed him to concentrate on the work for\nwhich he is most well-known today: the Historical and Critical\nDictionary (first edition 1697). It was, and remains, unlike\nanything ever written before or after. Across the top of each page of\nthis six-million-word encyclopedia, one finds short factual articles\non topics arranged alphabetically, dealing mainly with ancient and\nmodern authors, which display the vastness of Bayle\u2019s mastery of\nhistory and literature. But roughly 80% of the work is contained in\ntwo-columns of footnotes that take up most of each page and that offer\ncritical remarks on the slim factual content above. These footnotes,\nor \u201cremarks\u201d, give free rein to Bayle the revolutionary\nphilosopher. In these remarks we find original objections to\nDescartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz; arguments on behalf of ancient\nskepticism; strong reformulations of Zeno\u2019s paradoxes;\nmetaphysical foundations for religious toleration; refutations of all\nknown answers to the problem of evil; as well as obscene stories,\nhilarious anecdotes, feigned dialogues, and endless quotations of\nminor authors that Bayle thought his readers would simply enjoy. The\nwork was a commercial success but also a scandal. The last five years\nof Bayle\u2019s life were spent writing works that defended his\ncharacter against various accusations against it made on the basis of\nthe Dictionary. The influence of the work on subsequent\nEnlightenment philosophers, from Voltaire and Hume to Rousseau and\nKant, is well established.\n\nBayle died in December, 1706, pen-in-hand, putting the final touches\nto his Dialogues of Maximus and Themistius (posthumous 1707;\nOD IV: 1\u2013106), an apology of Bayle\u2019s life and works in general,\nbut in particular a defence of his most notorious thesis, that there\nis no solution to the problem of evil. Bayle allegedly declared\nshortly before dying that he was \u201ca Christian\nphilosopher\u201d. Whether or not this confession was sincere, one\nthing that is beyond doubt is that Bayle\u2019s philosophical\nreflection challenged the rational foundations of Christian thought\nmore strongly than the reflection of any philosopher before him.\n2. Society of Atheists\n\nThe philosophical work that earned Bayle an international reputation\nis the Various Thoughts on the Occasion of a Comet (1682),\ncompleted shortly before Louis XIV closed the Protestant Academy at\nSedan where Bayle was employed as a Professor. The manuscript of the\nbook accompanied Bayle in exile to Rotterdam and was soon published\nthere. Bayle feared that the strange and complicated plan of the work\nwould cause it to fail, but the opposite happened: the book\u2019s\noriginality and freshness led to a wide readership and an\ninternational reputation for Bayle. It is, nevertheless, a very\nstrange and complicated book.\n\nThe nominal goal of the work is to refute superstitions about comets.\nThe book is written as a series of letters to an unnamed Sorbonne\ntheologian, each of which is dedicated to reasons for or against\ninterpreting comets as signs of divine anger and forthcoming\nvengeance. Bayle offers a quick battery of purely philosophical\narguments against interpreting comets as anything other than natural\nevents, and then turns to his seventh \u201ctheological\u201d\nargument, which is the focus of the bulk of the work. The main thrust\nof the argument is to show that if God sends comets as punishment\nor signs of his anger, then God is responsible for causing the\nmost serious evil, idolatry, which God has said in the Bible in the\nworst of all sins. Since the entire world can see comets, and since\ncomets do not communicate any clear message, each nation will\ninterpret the comet in its own way. As a matter of historical fact,\nmost nations will fall into some divine interpretation of the event,\nwhere \u201cdivine\u201d refers to the local religion\u2019s\nconception of the divine. The result is that if comets are indeed\nintended as divine messages, then their appearance will lead to a\nsurge in global idol worship for which God will be responsible. If, on\nthe other hand, comets are natural events, and it is human folly to\ninterpret comets as divine messages, then God is innocent of any idol\nworship that results from the passing of space rocks.\n\nIn a surprising but logically seamless fashion characteristic of\nBayle, all of this turns into an impassioned defence of the virtues of\natheists and the possibility of founding a purely secular\n(non-religious) society. The Various Thoughts on a Comet is\nindeed about superstition, but it is not really about comets. The\nsuperstitions that Bayle spends the vast majority of the book\ntargeting are, first, that belief in God is necessary to live a moral\nlife, and second, that religion is necessary to keep society peaceful\nand lawful. Just as Bayle refuted superstitions about comets by\ndemonstrating that they are purely natural, predictable events, so\ntoo, Bayle refutes superstitions about atheists by demonstrating that\nmorality and law can and should be treated as purely natural,\npredictable aspects of human behaviour, based largely in education and\ntemperament.\n\nBayle\u2019s refutation of superstitions about atheism relies on a\nmix of historical fact, common sense, and philosophical argument. The\nrelevant historical facts are that there have been, in every age,\natheists noted for their virtue. In antiquity, Bayle points to\nDiagoras, Theodorus, Euhemerus, Nicanor, Hippo, and Epicurus. Closer\nto his own time, Bayle\u2019s favourite example is Lucilio Vanini,\nrenowned for his virtue, but who was tortured and then burned at the\nstake in 1619 for denying the existence of God. This leads to the\nultimate principle of Bayle\u2019s naturalized morality: people do\nnot act on the basis of their principles. Whether these are religious\nprinciples or secular moral principles makes no difference: actions do\nnot spring from belief or faith. Bayle takes this as an empirical fact\nand backs it up with historical examples. The real motives of human\naction are custom, education, and passion, all of which manifest\nthemselves as hard-to-shake habits.\n\n\nThus we see that from the fact that a man has no religion it does not\nfollow necessarily that he will be led to every sort of crime or to\nevery sort of pleasure. It follows only that he will be led to the\nthings to which his temperament and his turn of mind make him\nsensitive. (OD III: 113)\n\n\nAtheists can live just as calmly, wisely, generously, courageously,\nand in general, virtuously as religious believers because all of these\ncharacter traits spring from temperament, education, and custom, not\nfrom principles or judgments or faith. Therefore, a society comprised\nentirely of atheists can be a lawful, well-ordered place, assuming the\natheist citizens are raised and educated properly. In fact, Bayle\nsuggests in the most controversial passages of the Various\nThoughts on a Comet that an atheist society may even be\nmore peaceful than any religious society. That is because\nreligion has a natural tendency to inflame the worst passions in human\nnature:\n\n\nWe know the impression made on people\u2019s minds by the idea that\nthey are fighting for the preservation of their temples and\naltars\u2026; how courageous and bold we become when we fixate on\nthe hope of conquering others by means of God\u2019s protection, and\nwhen we are animated by the natural aversion we have for the enemies\nof our beliefs. (OD III: 84)\n\n\nNobody can deny that religion has been an important motive of war and\nviolence in human history. Since atheists lack religion, they should\nlive quieter lives.\n\nThe Various Thoughts on a Comet has been interpreted as a\ndisinterested refutation of various widespread (then and now)\nsuperstitions about atheism, as a focused attack on the Catholic\npersecution of Calvinists in France (Rex 1965), and as an apology for\natheism (Mori 1999 [2020]). Bayle insisted in his sequels to the work,\nthe Addition to the Various Thoughts (1686; OD III: 161\u2013186),\nand the Continuation of the Various Thoughts (1705; OD III:\n187\u2013417), that the goal of the work was simply to prove that atheism\nis no worse than idolatry, and that religious believers do not have a\nmonopoly on moral behaviour. These were, from Bayle\u2019s point of\nview, obvious historical facts that intellectual integrity requires us\nto admit.\n3. Freedom of Conscience\n\nEverything that Bayle wrote on religious toleration is either a\ndefence or an elaboration of the following argument, which first\nappeared in Bayle\u2019s General Critique of Maimbourg\u2019s\nHistory of Calvinism (1682):\n\n\n[I]f the true religion has some right to oppress others, then every\nreligion has this same right, provided that it is persuaded that it is\nGod\u2019s True Church. But it is false and impious that every\nreligion has the right to oppress, so it follows that God has not\ngiven to his Church any way other than persuasion and peaceful\ninstruction to bring people to the true faith. Consequently, Christian\nPrinces do not have any greater or lesser right to torment people over\nmatters of religion. (OD II: 105)\n\n\nThis argument was originally intended as an objection to\nMaimbourg\u2019s argument that Catholic Sovereigns have the right to\noppress Protestants in their realms, but not vice versa, and therefore\nthe persecution of Calvinists by Louis XIV was just, while the\npersecution of Catholics elsewhere was unjust. Despite this narrow\noriginal purpose, Bayle\u2019s claim eventually grew in scope to\nbecome the foundation of two of Bayle\u2019s most well-known theses:\nthe universal right to freedom of conscience, and the necessity of\nreligious toleration.\n\nBayle\u2019s fullest and clearest defence of the right to freedom of\nconscience appears in his sequel to the General Critique of\nMaimbourg\u2019s History of Calvinism, namely the New\nLetters by the Author of the General Critique of Maimbourg\u2019s\nHistory of Calvinism (1685). In the Ninth Letter, Bayle expands\nand defends the first part of the argument quoted above, namely\nthat\n\n\nif the true religion has some right to oppress others, then every\nreligion has this same right, provided that it is persuaded that it is\nGod\u2019s True Church.\n\n\nBayle reports that this claim was considered an \u201cimpious\nparadox\u201d by many readers. Bayle defends the claim in two steps.\nThe first step is to demonstrate that individuals have the right and\nthe duty to espouse any proposition that appears true to them after a\ncareful examination. The second step is to demonstrate that everyone\nhas the right and the duty to act on the basis of whatever apparent\ntruths they have espoused. In other words, individuals have the right\nand the duty to form and to act on the basis of conscience.\nFollowing a Medieval tradition, Bayle understood conscience to be\nfirst, a set of intuited moral truths (synderesis), and\nsecond, practical judgments made on the basis of these moral truths\n(conscientia).\n\nBayle employs an example to illustrate these steps of his argument for\nfreedom of conscience. He imagines a master who leaves his home for a\nlong time in the care of a servant, and who orders the servant not to\nallow anyone to enter the home unless they produce a certificate with\na particular insignia: anyone who produces such a certificate must be\ngiven entry, but anyone who lacks the certificate must be turned away.\nThe example is an analogy meant to represent the human mind\u2019s\nrelationships to God and the truth. God has left minds in the care of\nGod\u2019s servants, individual humans. We have been ordered by God\nto allow into our minds\u2014to believe\u2014only those propositions\nthat bear the criterion of truth, which Bayle always considered to be\na certain clarity and distinctness, or \u201cevidence\u201d as he\ncalled it. In order to obey God, we must accept all evident\npropositions as true and reject all non-evident propositions as false.\nJust as the servant has the right and duty in the master\u2019s\nabsence to decide what is an authentic certificate and what is not, so\ntoo individual humans have the right and duty to decide what is\nevident and what is not. This is the right and duty to form our\nindividual consciences, to decide what is morally good and true. And\njust as the servant has the right and duty subsequently to act on\ntheir inspection of certificates, so too humans have the right and\nduty to act on the basis of whatever has appeared true to them. This\nis the right and duty to act conscientiously. The Cartesian roots of\nBayle\u2019s epistemology and ethics of belief are clear.\n\nThe problem arises when, for example, the master\u2019s own son\narrives at the home, but lacks the required certificate; or when a\nbandit arrives at the home bearing a certificate that he found or that\nhe forged. In other words, what should we do when the objective truth\ndoes not appear evident, or when falsehoods appear evident to us?\nBayle takes it to be a historical fact that these cases arise\nfrequently, and he answers that we must reject the truth and believe\nthe falsehood:\n\n\n[T]he rights that God has given to the truth depend on a condition\nthat is so absolutely necessary, that in the absence of this condition\none could not render the least homage to the truth without committing\na crime. Since by this condition we can mean nothing other than that\nGod demands that we love and respect the truth provided that we know\nit, it is evident that, if the truth is unknown to us, it loses all\nits rights over us; and that, if error appears to us in the form of\nthe truth, then it acquires all rights over us. For, since it would\ndisplease God if we respected the truth that we thought was a lie,\ntherefore it would also offend him if we did not respect a lie that we\nbelieved was the truth. (OD II: 219)\n\n\nDuring the absence of the master, the servant has a duty to obey the\nmaster\u2019s orders: to admit those with a certificate, and to\nreject those without a certificate. The servant must do due diligence\nto ensure the certificates are authentic. However, if after the\nservant has inspected the certificate, he is convinced that a forged\ncertificate is authentic, or that an authentic certificate is forged,\nthen the servant has no recourse: he must act on his own best judgment\nuntil the master returns. Even though it is objectively bad to allow a\nbandit into the home, nevertheless, if the bandit\u2019s certificate\nis authentic or a compelling forgery, then the servant has the duty to\ngrant the bandit entry into the home. So too, human beings must act on\nthe basis of their individual judgment\u2014their conscience\u2014as\nlong as God is invisible and silent, which God always seems to be. In\nthe master\u2019s absence, the servant is effectively the master. So\ntoo in God\u2019s apparent absence, individual human beings are\nmasters of their own minds and actions, for there is nobody else who\ncan decide for us what is evident and what is not. Evidence, as Bayle\nconceives it, is an inherently individual matter, since it is a kind\nof appearance to an individual mind. Since the individual authority\nover one\u2019s mind and actions is based in a command of God, and\nsince God is a higher authority than any Sovereign, the Sovereign must\nrespect the individual\u2019s freedom to obey God\u2019s commands as\nthey see fit. The Sovereign must respect human autonomy, because it is\nGod\u2019s will. Bayle\u2019s argument for freedom of conscience\nprovides a clear link between Cartesian epistemology and later Kantian\nmoral autonomy.\n4. Religious Toleration\n\nBayle\u2019s argument for freedom of conscience does not provide a\nsufficient reason for sovereigns to tolerate minority religions in\ntheir realms. Freedom of conscience establishes that everyone has the\nsame right and duty to believe whatever appears true to them, and to\nact on the basis of apparently true beliefs. However, it is possible\nthat many religious people will believe that persecuting other\nreligions is a morally good action. Perhaps the Sovereign believes\nthat it is their own God-given duty to persecute others. It will\nfollow from Bayle\u2019s argument for the freedom of conscience that\nall of these religious people will have the same right and duty to\npersecute one another. The result will be a morally justified war of\nall against all. Bayle devotes his magnus opus on religious\ntoleration, A Philosophical Commentary on These Words of Jesus\nChrist: Compel Them to Enter (1686\u201388), to forestalling\nthis unhappy consequence of his doctrine of freedom of conscience.\n\nA universal religious war will result from Bayle\u2019s doctrine of\nfreedom of conscience only if religious believers think they have a\nright and duty to persecute other religions. This will happen only if\nbelievers think that God has commanded persecution, or in the absence\nof any clear direction from God, that the proposition\n\u201cpersecuting other religions is morally good\u201d is evidently\ntrue after careful rational inspection. Bayle\u2019s\nPhilosophical Commentary therefore argues that God has not\ncommanded persecution, and that persecuting other religions cannot\nappear good to any sincere rational person after careful examination.\nThe argumentative strategy of the book is in fact to use the second\nclaim to support the first: because persecution cannot appear good to\nany sincere rational person, therefore God has not commanded\npersecution.\n\nThe problem with Bayle\u2019s argument is that there is a long\ntradition within Christianity of interpreting the Gospel of Luke,\nchapter 14, verse 23\u2014which contains the words \u201cCompel them\nto enter\u201d\u2014as a divine command to persecute. The context of\nthis passage is the parable of the banquet, in which a master commands\nhis servants to invite guests into his home to enjoy a feast. The\nservant reports that the invited guests are too busy. So, the master\norders the servant to go out into the highways and byways and compel\npeople to enter his home to enjoy the feast. The passage had been\ntaken by Catholics since St. Augustine to justify forcing\nnon-Catholics to join the Church.\n\nBayle responds to this argument for persecution by insisting that\nScripture requires careful interpretation, and interpretation requires\na criterion. The first chapter of the Philosophical\nCommentary establishes that the only possible criterion of the\ninterpretation of Scripture is individual conscience and rational\nexamination:\n\n\nI am very persuaded that before God made Adam hear any voice to teach\nhim what he should do, God had already spoken to Adam interiorly, by\nmaking him see the vast and immense idea of a supremely perfect Being,\nand the eternal laws of justice and equity. (OD II: 369)\n\n\nTherefore, in order to decide whether Luke 14:23 is a divine command\nto persecute, Bayle proposes to investigate whether persecution is\nconsistent with our perception of the eternal laws of justice and\nequity. In other words, the question of whether God has commanded\npersecution boils down to the question whether an obligation to\npersecute can be considered an evidently good command from the\nperspective of reason.\n\nBayle anticipates Kant once again in the first chapter of the\nPhilosophical Commentary where he establishes a test to\ndetermine what should be considered an eternal law of justice:\n\n\n[A]nyone who wants to know distinctly the natural light with respect\nto morality should elevate himself above his own personal interest,\nand above the customs of his country, and should ask himself in\ngeneral whether the action is just by considering this: if the action\nin question were proposed in a country where it had never been the\ncustom, and where people were free to adopt or not to adopt the\nproposed action, would the people in that country find, upon careful\nexamination, that the action was just enough to merit adoption? (OD\nII: 368\u2013369).\n\n\nLike Kant\u2019s categorical imperative, this test requires us to\nconsider morality as a form of legislation over a possible kingdom of\npeople who are guided by reason and examination. Moral laws that pass\nthis test will be universal: anyone in any land will be capable of\nappreciating their worth and will find the laws worthy of adoption.\nWhether or not a moral command is evident or not depends on whether or\nnot it can be adopted universally by all people. In order to apply\nthis test, a clear maxim must be articulated. The maxim Bayle\nconsiders throughout the Philosophical Commentary is this:\n\u201cCompelling religious heretics to enter the true Church is\njust\u201d. The meaning of \u201ccompelling to enter\u201d that\nmotivates Bayle\u2019s arguments is one that he learned first-hand\nwhile living in France: Compulsion is violence. It is dragooning. It\nis forced conversions. It is imprisonment. It is confiscation of\nmaterial goods. It is expelling one from home and country if they\ncontinue to refuse the \u201cinvitation\u201d. It is barring certain\npeople from employment, school, or office. It is Bayle\u2019s brother\ndying in a damp basement after being imprisoned unjustly by Catholics.\nIt is Bayle himself needing to change the spelling of his last name\nwhile in France and eventually to live as a refugee in Rotterdam for\nthinking twice about Catholicism. When put this way, one hardly needs\nan argument against such compulsion. To some extent, that\u2019s\nBayle\u2019s point: persecution is evidently bad, not good. But he\noffers nine arguments against persecution anyway.\n\nReligious persecution does not pass Bayle\u2019s proto-Kantian\ncategorical imperative test, and therefore Luke 14:23 must not be\ninterpreted as a command to persecute. Why not? The First Part of the\nPhilosophical Commentary offers nine reasons why persecution\nfails the test. What most of these arguments have in common\u2014and\nagain the proto-Kantian tone of the arguments cannot be\noverstated\u2014is the claim that persecution is morally wrong\nbecause it leads Christians to contradict themselves. The essence of\nBaylean morality that emerges from these arguments is integrity:\nconsistency in one\u2019s beliefs and between one\u2019s beliefs and\nactions. Persecution is morally wrong because it necessarily entails\ninternal inconsistency: a lack of integrity. The first argument that\nBayle offers against persecution in Part 1, chapter 2, of the\nPhilosophical Commentary is also the best. Persecutors wish\nto bring people into the one true Church, presumably because they want\nthese people to love God properly. To love God properly is to form\ncorrect judgments about God and to have the right movements of the\nwill toward God (such as love). However, the actions of persecutors in\nBayle\u2019s day, like \u201cthreats, imprisonment, exile, beatings,\ntorture\u201d (OD II: 371), cannot possibly give rise to true\nknowledge and sincere love of God; on the contrary, persecutors\u2019\nactions are far better suited to making people hate God. Persecutors\ncannot possibly report sincerely that they are motivated to persecute\nby the desire to spread the love and knowledge of God. Persecutors lie\nto themselves, to their victims, and to God.\n\nBayle scholars have grappled for a long time with this seemingly\ndogmatic assertion of Bayle, who is usually more circumspect, if not\ndownright skeptical. What if there was a sincere persecutor who, after\nlong examination of Luke 14:23 and the tradition of biblical\ncommentary surrounding it, came to the conscientious conviction that\nGod wished him to use force to bring heterodox people into conformity\nwith what the persecutor believes is the one true Church? Then does it\nnot follow from Bayle\u2019s doctrine of the freedom of conscience\nthat the persecutor must persecute? This is known as the\n\u201cPersecutor Paradox\u201d or \u201cSincere Persecutor\nAporia\u201d (see Sol\u00e8re 2016). Some scholars believe that\nthis objection undermines the foundation of Bayle\u2019s moral\nargument for toleration, and requires Bayle to have recourse to a\nlegal or political solution to intolerance (Mori 1999 [2020]). Others\nbelieve that Bayle offers a valid response to the objection, or that\nthe objection is not very strong in the first place. The debate\nremains open.\n5. Criterion of Truth and Skepticism\n\nBayle never referred to himself as a skeptic, he never defended\nskepticism or skeptics at any length in his own voice, and his works\nestablish far more positive theses than you would expect from the pen\nof a skeptic. Nevertheless, the oldest interpretation of Bayle is that\nhe was a skeptic. In Bayle\u2019s day, the title\n\u201cskeptic\u201d or \u201cPyrrhonist\u201d was usually an\ninsult only slightly less offensive than another one frequently hurled\nat Bayle: \u201catheist\u201d. However, even Bayle\u2019s first and\ngreatest admirers freely admitted there was a skeptical character to\nBayle\u2019s writings. In his Poem on the Lisbon Earthquake,\nVoltaire said of Bayle:\n\n\nWise enough and great enough to live without a system, Bayle destroys\nall systems and then turns against himself. He is like Samson, buried\nwith his enemy Philistines under the rubble of a Temple toppled by his\nown hands.\n\n\nLater admirers, like Richard Popkin, also view Bayle as a skeptic, but\npraise him for his ingenious use of this ancient philosophical\nmethodology (Popkin 2003). Most recent debates focus on the particular\nkind of skepticism employed by Bayle: Pyrrhonian, Academic, or other\n(Maia Neto 1999). A few Bayle scholars deny that Bayle was a skeptic\nof any sort (McKenna 2015).\n\nPutting labels aside, the clearest view of Bayle\u2019s connection to\nskepticism comes from focusing on what he wrote concerning the\ncriterion of truth. The skeptical interpretation of Bayle gets support\nfrom the article \u201cPyrrho\u201d in the Historical and\nCritical Dictionary. A famous footnote to this article features a\ndiscussion between two Catholic abbots about the possibility of\ndefeating skeptics in debate. The \u201cphilosophical abbot\u201d,\nwho is really a skeptic, argues that victory can never be won over\nskeptics:\n\n\nRight away the philosophical abbot declared to the other that in order\nto hope for some victory over a skeptic, it is necessary to prove to\nhim before anything else that the truth is recognizable with certainty\nby some marks. We usually call these marks the criterion of truth. You\nwill rightly claim that evidence is the criterion of the truth; for if\nevidence is not this criterion, then nothing would be. \u201cSo be\nit\u201d, the skeptic will respond, \u201cI have been waiting for\nyou here all along; I will show you that there are things you reject\nas false that possess the highest degree of evidence\u201d.\n(Dictionary, \u201cPyrrho\u201d, remark B)\n\n\nThe philosophical abbot proceeds to demonstrate that the clearest,\nmost evident axioms of metaphysics are proven false by certain\nfundamental tenets of the Christian faith, which proves that evidence\nand truth do not always go hand-in-hand. For example, the Trinity\nforces us to reject the proposition that \u201cif two things are\nidentical to a third, then they are identical to each other\u201d,\nbecause both God the Father and God the Son are identical to God, but\nthe Father is not identical to the Son. Therefore, propositions can be\nboth supremely evident and false, thereby undermining the claim that\nevidence is the criterion of truth.\n\nThere are two reasons not to accept the article \u201cPyrrho\u201d\nas definitive proof that Bayle was a skeptic. First, the rejection of\nthe criterion of truth in this passage requires the assumption that\nthe Trinity, and other Christian dogmas, are true. At best, therefore,\nthe article demonstrates that there is a conflict between faith and\nreason, not that there is no certainty in philosophy. Many religious\nthinkers, including many Calvinist theologians, have held this same\nposition without being considered skeptics. The second reason is that,\nin various later works, Bayle revisits the issue of the criterion of\ntruth in his own voice and, rather than reject the criterion like the\nskeptical abbot did, supports a more nuanced view that evidence is a\nreliable, but merely probable criterion of truth. Like Descartes,\nBayle argues that one should not assent in the absence of evidence.\nBut unlike Descartes, Bayle argues that evidence comes in degrees and\nits presence does not guarantee the truth. These issues were the main\nfocus of the debate between Bayle and Jean Le Clerc in Bayle\u2019s\nlast years, and are dealt with at length in the first part of the\nDialogues of Maximus and Themistius (Bayle 1707 [2016]).\nBayle defends his position on the criterion of truth against the\naccusation of skepticism, so there is good reason not to consider him\na skeptic, and not to align his own views with those of his imagined\nphilosophical abbot in the Dictionary.\n6. Problem of Evil\n\nIf a perfectly good and all-powerful God alone created everything in\nthe universe, then why do pain, moral wickedness, and so many\nvarieties of imperfection exist? Philosophers today refer to the\nfamily of issues raised by this question as \u201cthe problem of\nevil\u201d. There is perhaps no thesis for which Bayle is more\nwell-known than the skeptical claim that there is no rational solution\nto the problem of evil. The centerpiece of any discussion of Bayle and\nthe problem of evil must be the Dictionary, particularly the\narticles \u201cManicheans\u201d and \u201cPaulicians\u201d of the\nfirst edition, and the \u201cClarification on the Manicheans\u201d\nof the second. It is in these texts that Bayle attempts to refute\nevery theodicy he had yet encountered, thereby demonstrating the\nincapacity of reason, especially within the confines of Christian\ndogma, to explain the origin of evil in a way that does not make God\nits sole author. The suggestion that reason leads us ineluctably to\nthe conclusion that God is morally responsible for all evil was found\nso scandalous that Bayle was forced to spend the last decade of his\nlife defending himself against charges of atheism and even sedition on\naccount of it. The Rationalist theologians Jean Le Clerc and Isaac\nJaquelot were Bayle\u2019s principal adversaries, and their\nobjections to Bayle, as well as their attempts at theodicy, prompted\nhim to expand his skeptical reflections on evil in subsequent books,\nincluding the Responses to a Provincial\u2019s Questions,\nand the posthumous Dialogues of Maximus and Themistius. These\nfinal works were the occasional cause of Leibniz\u2019s\nTheodicy (1710), as well as the inspiration for (and source\nfor many of the arguments of) Voltaire\u2019s satirical novella,\nCandide (1759), several chapters of Hume\u2019s\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion (1779), and possibly\nKant\u2019s late essay, On the Miscarriage of All Philosophical\nTrials in Theodicy (1791).\n\nBayle\u2019s controversial \u201cdoctrine\u201d on the problem of\nevil that caused so much commotion was carefully summarized by Bayle\nhimself in three points:\n\nThe natural light and revelation teach us clearly that there is\nonly one principle of all things, and that this principle is\ninfinitely perfect;\nThe way of reconciling the moral and physical evil of humanity\nwith all the attributes of this single, infinitely perfect principle\nof all things surpasses our philosophical lights, such that the\nManichean objections leave us with difficulties that human reason\ncannot resolve;\nNevertheless, it is necessary to believe firmly what the natural\nlight and revelation teach us about the unity and infinite perfection\nof God, just as it is necessary to believe by faith and submission to\ndivine authority the mysteries of the Trinity and the Incarnation. (OD\nIII: 992b\u2013993a)\n\n\nThe first principle was a common supposition in Bayle\u2019s day, and\nso obviously caused no controversy. Nevertheless, Bayle argued on\nbehalf of the principle in \u201cManicheans\u201d, remark D, in\npassages that render more precise the nature of Bayle\u2019s\nskepticism about theodicy. Bayle imagines a monotheist philosopher,\nMelissus, arguing with a dualist philosopher, Zoroaster, over the\norigin of evil. The dispute begins with a contest over a\npriori arguments. In other words, the first question raised is\nwhether one principle of creation or two is most in accord with ideas\nof pure reason. Melissus wins this particular debate, in Bayle\u2019s\nview, because it is more agreeable to a priori reason to\nsuppose that there is just one necessary and infinitely perfect being\nresponsible for the creation of the universe than to suppose that\nthere are two warring gods, one good and the other evil (which is the\nview of Bayle\u2019s fictionalized Zoroaster). Melissus\u2019\nmonotheism is, in short, simpler and more elegant than\nZoroaster\u2019s dualism.\n\nThe contentious elements of Bayle\u2019s doctrine begin to surface\nwhen the debate then turns to a posteriori reasons; that is,\nonce the question shifts away from the beauty of the theory to its\nability to account for the observable phenomena. In this debate\nMelissus fares worse than his interlocutor, since human reason\nfinds\n\n\nthe manner in which evil was introduced under the empire of a\nsovereign being, infinitely good, infinitely holy, and infinitely\npowerful \u2026 not only inexplicable, but even incomprehensible;\nand everything that is opposed to the reasons why this being permitted\nevil is more agreeable to the natural light and to the ideas of order\nthan these reasons are. (Dictionary,\n\u201cPaulicians\u201d, remark E)\n\n\nSimplicity and elegance are now on the side of Zoroaster (and the\nManichean tradition that followed him, if Bayle\u2019s history is\ncorrect), for whom all the good in the world is traceable to a\nperfectly benevolent deity, while all the evil is the effect of his\nmalevolent enemy. Therefore, whereas a priori reason and\nChristian Scripture point toward monotheism (Bayle\u2019s first\nprinciple), a posteriori reason raises perpetual difficulties\nfor this picture in light of the way the world actually is\n(Bayle\u2019s second principle).\n\nSome of the most notorious remarks in the Dictionary are\nthose in which Bayle details how a dualist could refute the\ntraditional Christian accounts of the origin of evil, most of which\nbegin from the story of the Fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of\nEden. Bayle begins his critique by asking how such a Fall was even\nmetaphysically possible. If Adam and Eve were created wholly good,\nthen they should not have had the capacity to sin, since such a\ncapacity is hardly a good quality. But supposing an answer to this\nworry could be given, Bayle moves on to demand why God would permit\nthe possibility of sin to reduce to an actual sin, considering the\nterrible consequences that befell humanity as a result of it. The most\ncommon response to this question was that God had given human beings\nfree will, the most generous divine gift of all, and the autonomy of\nwhich God willed to respect in order to make true worship and love of\nhim possible. Bayle\u2019s response again focuses on the metaphysical\npossibility of the explanation: can a creature that derives all its\nbeing from God ever act in a manner that is truly free? Even supposing\nan account of freedom could be offered to answer this question, Bayle\nstill finds the free-will defence unsatisfying on account of\nGod\u2019s alleged omniscience. Surely God foresaw the first sin of\nhumankind from all eternity, yet he created humans with freedom\nanyway. Is this not comparable, Bayle asks, to supplying a criminal\nwith a knife knowing full-well that he will commit murder with it? If\nso, the responsibility for the murder falls at least partially on the\nsupplier of the weapon. But perhaps God allowed humans to fall so that\nhe could send his Son to redeem them. To this last resort of the\nChristians\u2014the felix culpa theodicy\u2014Bayle\nobserves that God in this case would resemble a father who allowed his\nson to break his arm (though he could have prevented it) just so that\nhe could display his skill at cast-making to the neighbors. Or God\nwould be like a king who permitted a deadly uprising just so he could\ndemonstrate his ability to quell it. God would not appear\ninfinitely perfect on any of these hypotheses.\n\nSuch reflections demonstrate the need for Bayle\u2019s third\nprinciple (assuming that one is interested in upholding Christian\nmonotheism). The origin of evil, like the Trinity, is a mystery\nfraught with endless difficulties. On Bayle\u2019s view of religious\nmysteries, which he lays out at the beginning of his Clarification\non the Manicheans, philosophical objections to mysteries are\nnothing troubling, but merely serve to confirm that God\u2019s mind\ninfinitely surpasses human minds. If there were no insoluble\nphilosophical objections to mysteries, then there would be nothing\nmysterious about the doctrines in question-reason could answer every\ndifficulty, and could claim equality with God\u2019s own mind. For\nthese reasons Bayle conflated the traditional categories of\n\u201cabove reason\u201d and \u201cagainst reason\u201d, claiming\nthat mysteries were necessarily both. Reason is consequently useless,\neven pernicious, as a basis for belief in the mysteries, and so must\nbe replaced by simple faith (Bayle\u2019s third principle).\n\nBayle\u2019s most able philosophical critic on these issues during\nhis lifetime was Le Clerc, who argued that Bayle\u2019s doctrine on\nthe problem of evil was intentionally subversive of religion. The\nbasis of Le Clerc\u2019s accusation of atheism against Bayle was his\nclaim that it is not psychologically possible to continue to believe\nsome doctrine after one has conceded that it is met with insoluble\ndifficulties. If this psychology of belief were true, then the second\nprinciple of Bayle\u2019s doctrine would destroy belief in monotheism\nbecause, by supposition, it would be impossible to believe in the\nunity of God after acknowledging the irresistible force of the\nManicheans\u2019 objections. In response to Le Clerc, Bayle argued in\nhis posthumous Dialogues of Maximus and Themistius that it is\nnot only psychologically possible to believe in a proposition that has\nbeen defeated in argument, but also very common. Bayle points to the\ndebate over the continuum to illustrate his thesis. Those engaged in\nthe debate over whether lines are infinitely divisible or ultimately\nreducible to points of finite size recognize that there are insoluble\nparadoxes opposed to each point of view. Yet there are adherents of\nboth views all the same, which demonstrates, by historical fact, that\nit is possible to believe in a proposition (e.g., \u201clines are\ninfinitely divisible\u201d) despite recognizing unanswerable\ndifficulties (e.g., Zeno\u2019s paradoxes). Far from a recommendation\nof adopting irrational fideism in response to the problem of evil,\nBayle therefore believed he was urging the same rational retreat from\ncertain debates that philosophers are commonly forced into when they\nargue about labyrinthine philosophical topics like the continuum.\n7. Bayle Enigma\n\nThere are few authors in the early modern period whose works are more\ndifficult than those of Bayle to interpret on even the most basic\nlevel. What is the ultimate conclusion of any particular work by\nBayle? What are the main arguments? When is Bayle writing in his own\nvoice and when is he writing in the voice of an imagined character?\nWhat are the appropriate contexts in which to read Bayle\u2019s\nworks? Who were the intended audiences? These can be straightforward\nquestions to answer when reading philosophical authors; most authors\nanswer the questions themselves in a Preface. However, Bayle usually\nwrote books anonymously for fictional audiences with explicit aims\nthat were often mere pretences for the real purpose behind his books.\nIf there is any single, overarching thesis of any of his works, it is\nburied very deeply indeed. Taking Bayle\u2019s oeuvre as a\nwhole, the interpretive difficulties are even more challenging. Thomas\nLennon gives the most memorable statement of this problem that is\nknown as the \u201cBayle Enigma\u201d:\n\n\nTo take just the twentieth-century literature, the suggestions are\nthat Bayle was fundamentally a positivist, an atheist, a deist, a\nskeptic, a fideist, a Socinian, a liberal Calvinist, a conservative\nCalvinist, a libertine, a Judaizing Christian, a Judaeo-Christian, or\neven a secret Jew, a Manichean, an existentialist\u2026to the point\nthat it is tempting to conclude that these commentators cannot have\nbeen talking about the same author, or at least that they have not\nused the same texts. There can be overlap among these classifications,\nso that not all of the interpretations entirely exclude one another.\nImplausible as it may seem, moreover, all of these suggestions have at\nleast some plausibility. (Lennon 1999: 15)\n\n\n\u201cThe Bayle Enigma\u201d is the term used to denote the\ndifficulty one faces when trying to label or to categorize or to\ninterpret Bayle\u2019s works as a whole or individually. The\ndifficulty arises from the fact that numerous labels seem to fit\nBayle\u2019s writings, but some of these labels are mutually\nexclusive. It is tempting to dismiss the Enigma on the basis that all\ngreat authors are complex and write works with multiple layers of\nmeaning: why do we need to label authors anyway? But in the case of\nBayle, the problem is that his works are not just complex, but\nseemingly self-contradictory. In one and the same book, and even in\none and the same argument, Bayle might be advocating faith in God or\nhe might be undermining belief in the existence of God\u2014it\ndepends how you read him. Some engagement with the Bayle Enigma is\ntherefore necessary just to enter into Bayle\u2019s works on the most\nelementary level.\n\nFour global interpretations of Bayle\u2019s works have recurred since\nhis death over three centuries ago: the atheist reading, the skeptical\nreading, the Christian-fideist reading, and the Rationalist reading.\nThese are by no means the only possible interpretations of\nBayle\u2019s writings; they are just the most common readings because\nthey are the most plausible. Bayle\u2019s enemy Jurieu was the first\nto launch the accusation of atheism against Bayle in his own lifetime,\nmaking his case largely on the basis of the Various Thoughts on a\nComet with its elaborate defences of the virtuous atheist and the\nSociety of Atheists. The most recent and influential interpreter to\nfind a commitment to atheism in Bayle\u2019s works is Gianluca Mori,\nwhose 1999 Bayle philosophe argues that \u201c[a]ll the\nroads of the philosophical reflection of Bayle lead to atheism\u201d\n(Mori 1999 [2020: 189]). The main evidence of Bayle\u2019s atheism,\naccording to Mori, is his obsession with the problem of evil\nthroughout his life, and in particular his contention that there is no\nsystem of Christian thought that can resolve this problem. The\neveryday experience of every human being, no matter how privileged\nthey are, provides ample evidence that the universe is not the work of\nan infinitely good creator. Any theodicy that attempts to reconcile\nthe experiences of pain and sin with the existence of an infinitely\ngood creator will have to limit that creator in some way, either in\nits power, its knowledge, or its uniqueness, to the point that the\ncreator will cease to resemble anything worthy of the name\n\u201cGod\u201d. According to Mori, the simplest way to read\nBayle\u2019s hundreds of thousands of published words devoted to the\nproblem of evil is to read them as an argument that God does not\nexist.\n\nMori\u2019s interpretation of Bayle is compelling, especially today\nwhen the problem of evil is routinely viewed not only as an argument,\nbut as the most powerful argument, against the existence of the\nAbrahamic God. However, there are at least two problems with\nMori\u2019s interpretation taken broadly. The first is that Bayle was\nconsistent and adamant throughout his career that the conclusion of\nhis reflection on the problem of evil is not that God does not exist,\nbut that reason is too weak to reconcile the existence of a perfect\nGod with the human experience of evil. This conclusion is, on the\nsurface at least, skeptical rather than atheistic. For Bayle, the\nproblem of evil is just another example of human reason\u2019s\nincapacity to resolve problems involving the concepts of infinity and\nunity. Intractable difficulties relating to infinite divisibility,\nlike Zeno\u2019s paradoxes, and persistent problems in explaining the\nunion of mind and body in a single human person are non-theological\nexamples in Bayle\u2019s thought of the failure of reason in matters\nrelating to infinity and unity. The problem of evil, on the skeptical\nreading of Bayle, is just Bayle\u2019s favorite theological argument\nfor the limits of reason.\n\nAccording to the Christian-fideist reading, the problem of evil is\nBayle\u2019s main tool for displaying to readers the need for faith\nin addition to reason. Calvin and Jurieu were two thinkers whose\ncommitments to Christianity were never questioned and who, prior to\nBayle, argued in print that human reason could not resolve all the\ndifficulties relating to evil. Seen in this context, Bayle\u2019s\nwritings on evil are not original attacks on theism, as Mori reads\nthem, but rather traditional Calvinist attacks on reason with the aim\nof pointing the way to faith. Elisabeth Labrousse (1964) and Walter\nRex (1965) demonstrate the ways in which all of Bayle\u2019s writings\ncan be illuminated by reading them in the context of Christian\npolemics, mainly between Calvinists and Catholics. According to\nLabrousse and Rex, Bayle was an opponent not of Christianity in\ngeneral, but only of one branch of Christianity\u2014Roman\nCatholicism.\n\nAnother clarifying context for understanding much of Bayle\u2019s\nphilosophical reflection is Rationalism. Todd Ryan (2009) and Antony\nMcKenna (2015) have shown that Bayle was not skeptical of all\nphilosophical dogmas. He remained committed, in Ryan\u2019s view, to\na variety of specific Cartesian metaphysical doctrines, like mind-body\ndualism, the ontology of substance, and matter as extension,\nthroughout his career. In McKenna\u2019s view, Bayle remained\ncommitted to the rational certainty of \u201ccommon notions\u201d of\nreason, especially in the domains of metaphysics and morality. These\nare first principles that form the basis of all other reasoning,\nincluding theological reasoning; without these principles, human\nreason is not only weak but entirely silent. Bayle was, therefore, a\nRationalist on this reading.\n\nWhat do we make of an author who might have been an atheist or a\nChristian, depending on how you read him; or who might have been a\nskeptic or a Rationalist, depending on your perspective? This is the\nmain outstanding problem in the Bayle literature. One compelling\nsolution is provided by Lennon\u2019s 1999 Reading Bayle.\nLennon, following the pioneering work of Jos\u00e9 R. Maia Neto\n(1999), interprets Bayle\u2019s oeuvre in the light of a\ncommitment to Academic integrity as it was expressed by Cicero in his\nwritings on the Academic skeptics. The goal of this integrity is to\nkeep one\u2019s power of judgment untrammelled; it is to keep an open\nmind. The method the Academics used to achieve this kind of\nintellectual freedom was the rigorous presentation of both sides of a\ndebate; to express competing positions not as a lawyer would do, with\nthe goal of making one side look weaker than the other, but as a\nreporter would do, allowing each side to make its best case in its own\nwords. Lennon finds a commitment to these goals and methods especially\nin the Dictionary, where Bayle quotes like a reporter far\nmore than he argues like a lawyer. The power of this Academic reading\nof Bayle is that it explains why Bayle appears to contradict himself.\nThe problem arises because readers of Bayle fail to recognize that\nBayle did not personally believe everything he wrote; sometimes he was\nmerely laying out somebody else\u2019s position for the sake of\nbalancing arguments and promoting Academic freedom of judgment. Just\nas God, the author of creation, allows creatures to conflict with each\nother and even to oppose God\u2019s owns plans for creation, so too\nBayle, the author of a vast oeuvre, allows the characters and\nphilosophical theses in his works to conflict with each other and even\nto oppose Bayle\u2019s own stated aims in his works. The Bayle\nenigma, just like Bayle\u2019s beloved problem of evil, may well be\ninsoluble because of the role played in each by the conflict between\nauthorial design and human freedom.\n",
