    "main_text": "\n\nThe original position is a central feature of John Rawls\u2019s\nsocial contract account of justice, \u201cjustice as fairness,\u201d\nset forth in A Theory of Justice (TJ). The original position\nis designed to be a fair and impartial point of view that is to be\nadopted in our reasoning about fundamental principles of justice. In\ntaking up this point of view, we are to imagine ourselves in the\nposition of free and equal persons who jointly agree upon and commit\nthemselves to principles of social and political justice for a\nwell-ordered democratic society. The main distinguishing feature of\nthe original position is \u201cthe veil of ignorance\u201d: To\nensure complete impartiality of judgment, the parties are deprived of\nall knowledge of their personal characteristics and conceptions of the\ngood, and of social and historical circumstances. They do know of\ncertain fundamental interests they all have in exercising their moral\npowers, plus general facts about psychology, economics, political\nsociology, biology, and other social and natural sciences. The parties\nin the original position are presented with a list of the major\nconceptions of justice drawn from the tradition of social and\npolitical philosophy and are assigned the task of choosing from among\nthese the conception of justice that best enables them to effectively\npursue their final ends and commitments and their fundamental\ninterests. Rawls contends that the most rational decision for the\nparties in the original position are the two principles of justice:\nThe first principle guarantees the equal basic rights and liberties\nneeded to secure the fundamental interests of free and equal citizens\nand to pursue a wide range of conceptions of the good. The basic\nliberties include freedom of conscience, thought, expression, and\nassociation; freedom and integrity of the person with the right to\nhold personal property; equal political liberties, and rights\nprotected by the rule of law. The second principle regulates\npermissible social and economic inequalities: first it provides fair\nequality of educational, employment, and cultural opportunities that\nenable all to develop their capacities and fairly compete for social\npositions of office and responsibility. Next, the second principle\nrequires economic inequalities of income, wealth, powers and\nprerogatives to be arranged to maximally benefit the least advantaged\nmembers of society, making them better off than they would be in any\nalternative economic system (the difference principle.)\n",
