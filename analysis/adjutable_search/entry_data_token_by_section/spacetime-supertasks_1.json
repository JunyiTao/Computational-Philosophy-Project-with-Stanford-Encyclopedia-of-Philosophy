    "main_text": "Mechanical properties || Missing final and initial steps: The Zeno walk\n1.1 Missing final and initial steps: The Zeno walk\n\nSupertasks often lack a final or initial step. A famous example is the\nfirst of\n Zeno\u2019s Paradoxes,\n the Paradox of the Dichotomy. The runner Achilles begins at the\nstarting line of a track and runs \u00bd of the distance to the\nfinish line. He then runs half of the remaining distance, or \u00bc\nof the total. He then runs half the remaining distance again, or\n\u215b of the total. And he continues in this way ad infinitum,\ngetting ever-closer to the finish line (Figure 1.1.1). But there is no\nfinal step in this task.\n\n\nFig 1.1.1. The Zeno Dichotomy supertask.\n\n\nThere is also a \u201cregressive\u201d version of the Dichotomy\nsupertask that has no initial step. Suppose that Achilles does reach\nthe finish line. Then he would have had to travel the last \u00bd of\nthe track, and before that \u00bc of the track, and before that\n\u215b of the track, and so on. In this description of the Achilles\nrace, we imagine winding time backwards and viewing Achilles getting\never-closer to the starting line (Figure 1.1.2). But now there is no\ninitial step in the task.\n\n\nFig 1.1.2. Regressive version of the Zeno Dichotomy supertask.\n\n\nZeno, at least as portrayed in Aristotle\u2019s Physics, argued\nthat as a consequence, motion does not exist. Since an infinite number\nof steps cannot be completed, Achilles will never reach the finish\nline (or never have started in the regressive version). However,\nmodern mathematics provides ways of explaining how Achilles can\ncomplete this supertask. As Salmon (1998) has pointed out, much of the\nmystery of Zeno\u2019s walk is dissolved given the modern definition of a\nlimit. This provides a precise sense in which the following sum\nconverges:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\cdots .\n\\]\n\n\nAlthough it has infinitely many terms, this sum is a geometric series\nthat converges to 1 in the standard topology of the real numbers. A\ndiscussion of the philosophy underpinning this fact can be found in\nSalmon (1998), and the mathematics of convergence in any real analysis\ntextbook that deals with infinite series. From this perspective,\nAchilles actually does complete all of the supertask steps in the\nlimit as the number of steps goes to infinity. One might only doubt\nwhether or not the standard topology of the real numbers provides the\nappropriate notion of convergence in this supertask. A discussion of\nthe subtleties of the choice of topology has been given by Mclaughlin\n(1998).\n\nMax Black (1950) argued that it is nevertheless impossible to complete\nthe Zeno task, since there is no final step in the infinite sequence.\nThe existence of a final step was similarly demanded on a priori terms\nby Gwiazda (2012). But as Thomson (1954) and Earman and Norton (1996)\nhave pointed out, there is a sense in which this objection equivocates\non two different meanings of the word \u201ccomplete.\u201d On the\none hand \u201ccomplete\u201d can refer to the execution of a final\naction. This sense of completion does not occur in Zeno\u2019s Dichotomy,\nsince for every step in the task there is another step that happens\nlater. On the other hand, \u201ccomplete\u201d can refer to carrying\nout every step in the task, which certainly does occur in Zeno\u2019s\nDichotomy. From Black\u2019s argument one can see that the Zeno Dichotomy\ncannot be completed in the first sense. But it can be completed in the\nsecond. The two meanings for the word \u201ccomplete\u201d happen to\nbe equivalent for finite tasks, where most of our intuitions about\ntasks are developed. But they are not equivalent when it comes to\nsupertasks.\n\nHermann Weyl (1949, \u00a72.7) suggested that if one admits that the\nZeno race is possible, then one should equally admit that it is\npossible for a machine to carry out an infinite number of tasks in\nfinite time. However, one difference between the Zeno run and a\nmachine is that the Zeno run is continuous, while the tasks carried\nout by a machine are typically discrete. This led Gr\u00fcnbaum (1969)\nto consider the \u201cstaccato\u201d version of the Zeno run, in\nwhich Achilles pauses for successively shorter times at each\ninterval.\n",
