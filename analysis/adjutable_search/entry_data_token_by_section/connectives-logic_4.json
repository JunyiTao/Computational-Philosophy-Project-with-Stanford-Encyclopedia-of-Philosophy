    "main_text": "Selected Existence Questions || Logical Subtraction (Example 4)\n4.4 Logical Subtraction (Example 4)\n\nSuppose one wants to say more about the weather than that it rained on\na particular Saturday. One wants to strengthen one\u2019s commitments\nso that they include not only rain on Saturday but also rain on the\nfollowing Sunday. With \u2227 (assuming some background \u2227-classical\nconsequence relation) there is nothing easier. Abbreviating \u201cIt\nrained on the Saturday in question\u201d to Sat and\n\u201cIt rained on Sunday\u201d to Sun, one can convert\none\u2019s original statement into one making the stronger claim by\npassing from Sat to Sat \u2227 Sun. Now\nsuppose one wanted a similar device but working in the reverse\ndirection. One starts with a claim whose content is given by Sat\n\u2227 Sun and wants to modify this using a connective\nwhich removes commitments in much the way that \u2227 adds them, and\nusing this connective, often called logical subtraction\n(though a case could be made for \u2018logical division\u2019 in\nview of the usual association of conjunction with multiplication), one\nwants to take away the commitment to rain on Sunday, leaving only the\noriginal claim. That is, one would like a connective added to the\nlanguage of one\u2019s favoured consequence relation, in such a way\nthat the added connective was governed by rules making the extension\nconservative, but for which one had the equivalence (writing \u22a2)\nfor the extended consequence relation:\n\n(Sat \u2227 Sun) \u2212  Sun\n\u22a3\u22a2 Sat.\n\n\nAn early and plausible suggestion for the treatment of logical\nsubtraction was made in Hudson (1975). According to this suggestion,\nno new connective is required, at least if we already have a\nreasonable implication connective at our disposal, because if we are\nto think of \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c8 as giving us\nthe result of taking away the content of \u03c8 from that of \u03c6,\nthen this should be the weakest statement which, together with \u03c8,\nhas \u03c6 as a consequence. But this is just \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6, if\nthe standard natural deduction rules for \u2192 from Section\n 2\n are accepted (as in intuitionistic and classical logic). Yet this\ndoes not give us the inset equivalence above. If we treat\n(Sat \u2227 Sun) \u2212 Sun as Sun\n\u2192 (Sat \u2227 Sun), then this is equivalent (in\nthe logics just mentioned and many others) to Sun \u2192 \nSat, whereas we wanted the stronger Sat itself (stronger\naccording to those logics, again).\n\nThe example above used an interpreted language with atomic sentences\nSat and Sun. The inset equivalence presented\ninvolving them would not be reasonable for all sentences. Modulating\nback to the issue of a formal propositional logic involving the\nenvisaged new connective, such an equivalence would not be reasonable\nfor arbitrary \u03c6 and \u03c8 in place of them, since we would expect\nthe new connective to be congruential according to the desired\nconsequence relation, and any unrestricted such equivalence would then\ndeliver from \u03c61 \u2227 \u03c8 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c62 \u2227 \u03c8\u2014by \u201csubtracting \u03c8 from\nboth sides\u201d (in view of congruentiality)\u2014the conclusion\nthat \u03c61 \u22a3\u22a2 \u03c62, and it easy\nto find counterexamples to such cancellation inferences for even quite\nweak initial logics. Since the counterexamples arise for\n\u03c61, \u03c62, in the language unexpanded by\n\u201c\u2212\u201d, the sense in which a generalized version of the\nearlier equivalence would not be reasonable is that it would not be\nconservative over the initial logic. Here we say no more about how to\nconstrain the equivalence in question, or, more generally, about\nwhether there really is any such logical subtraction connective as\nwe have been\n envisaging.[45]\n",
