Early Partial Formalizations and Metamathematics\n\nAs Brouwer was more interested in developing pure mathematics than in\ndeveloping logic, which for him was a form of applied mathematics, he\nnever made an extensive study of the latter. In particular, he never\nmade a systematic comparison of intuitionistic logic and classical\nlogic as formalized, for example, in Principia Mathematica\n(Whitehead & Russell 1910) or by the Hilbert school (Hilbert 1923;\nHilbert & Ackermann 1928). What motivated others to make such\ncomparisons was the publication by Brouwer in international journals\nof weak counterexamples that showed how these also affected very\ngeneral mathematical principles such as trichotomy for real numbers\n(see above,\n section 3.2).\n\nClearly, to make a systematic comparison possible, one needs a\ncodification of intuitionistic logic in a formal system. On the\nintuitionistic view that cannot exist, as logic is as open-ended as\nthe mathematics it depends on. But one may formalize fragments of\nintuitionistic logic. The relevant papers here are Kolmogorov 1925,\nHeyting 1928 (unpublished), Glivenko 1928, Glivenko 1929, and Heyting\n 1930.[16]\n But perhaps the first to give systematic thought to the matter was\nPaul Bernays. In a letter to Heyting of November 5, 1930, he\nwrote:\n\n\nThe lectures that Prof. Brouwer at the time held in G\u00f6ttingen\n(for the first time) [1924 (van Dalen 2001: 305)], led me to the\nquestion how a Brouwerian propositional logic could be separated out,\nand I arrived at the result that this can be done by leaving out the\nsingle formula \\(\\neg \\neg a \\supset a\\) (in your symbolism). I then\nalso wrote to Prof. Brouwer [correcting Brouwer\u2019s impression at\nthe time that this formula is weaker than PEM]. (Troelstra 1990:\n 8)[17]\n\n\n(Bernays\u2019 correction was included, at the proof stage, in\nBrouwer\u2019s paper (1925E: 252n.4 [Mancosu 1998: 292n.4]).)\nHowever, Bernays did not publish his idea for a Brouwerian logic.\n(Kolmogorov would publish the same idea in 1925; see below.)\n\nIn setting up a formal system to capture, albeit necessarily only in\npart, logic as it figures in Brouwer\u2019s foundations, naturally\nsome priorly obtained meaning explanation is needed to serve as the\ncriterion for intuitionistic validity. Yet none of the papers by\nKolmogorov, Heyting, and Glivenko just mentioned made an explicit\ncontribution to the meaning explanation of intuitionistic logic. As we\nwill see, the explanations as given in the papers (which is not\nnecessarily all their respective authors had in mind) were too vague\nfor that. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that the systems were\nnot equivalent; notably, Kolmogorov rejected Ex Falso, while\nHeyting and Glivenko accepted it. We will now discuss these papers in\nturn.\n",
