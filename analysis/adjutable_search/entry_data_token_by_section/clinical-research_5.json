    "main_text": "Contract Theory\n6. Contract Theory\n\nA few commentators (Caplan 1984; Harris 2005; Heyd 1996) try to\njustify exposing research participants to risks for the benefit\nof others by citing an obligation to participate in clinical research.\nAt least all individuals who have access to medical care have\nbenefited from the efforts of previous research participants in the\nform of effective vaccines and better medical treatments. One might\ntry to argue that these benefits obligate us to participate in\nclinical research when its our turn.\n\nCurrent participation in clinical research typically benefits future\npatients. However, if we incur an obligation for the benefits that are\ndue to previous research studies, we presumably are obligated to the\npatients who participated in those studies, an obligation we cannot\ndischarge by participating in current studies. This approach also does\nnot provide a way to justify the very first clinical trials, such as\nLind\u2019s, which of necessity enrolled participants who had never\nbenefited from previous clinical research.\n\nAlternatively, one might argue that the obligation to participate does\nnot trace to the benefits we receive from the efforts of previous\nresearch participants. Rather, the obligation is to the overall social\nsystem of which clinical research is a part (Brock 1994). For example,\none might argue that individuals acquire this obligation as the result\nof being raised in the context of a cooperative scheme or society. We\nare obligated to do our part because of the many benefits we have\nenjoyed as a result of living within such a scheme.\n\nThe first challenge for this view is to explain why the mere enjoyment\nof benefits, without some prospective agreement to respond in kind,\nobligates individuals to help others. Presumably, your doing a nice\nthing for me yesterday, without my knowledge or invitation, does not\nobligate me to do you a good turn today. This concern seems even\ngreater with respect to pediatric research. Children certainly benefit\nfrom previous research studies, but typically do so unknowingly and\noften with vigorous opposition. The example of pediatric research\nmakes the further point that justification of clinical research\non straightforward contractualist grounds will be difficult at best.\nContract theories have difficulties with those groups, such as\nchildren, who do not accept in any meaningful way the benefits of the\nsocial system under which they live (Gauthier 1990).\n\nIn a Rawlsian vein, one might try to establish an obligation to\nparticipate in clinical research based on the choices individuals\nwould make regarding the structure of society from a position of\nignorance regarding their own place within that society, from behind a\nveil of ignorance (Rawls 1999). To make this argument, one would have\nto modify the Rawlsian argument in several respects. The knowledge\nthat one is currently living could well bias one\u2019s decision\nagainst the conduct of clinical research. Those who know they are\nalive at the time the decision is being made have already reaped many\nof the benefits they will receive from the conduct of clinical\nresearch.\n\nTo avoid these biases, we might stretch the veil of ignorance to\nobscure the generation to which one belongs\u2014past, present or\nfuture (Brock 1994). Under a veil of ignorance so stretched,\nindividuals might choose to participate in clinical research as long\nas the benefits of the practice exceed its overall burdens. One could\nthen argue that justice as fairness gives all individuals an\nobligation to participate in clinical research when their turn comes.\nThis approach seems to have the advantage of explaining why we can\nexpose even children to some risks for the benefit of others, and why\nparents can give permission for their children to participate in such\nresearch. This argument also seems to imply not simply that clinical\nresearch is acceptable, but that, in a range of cases, individuals\nhave an obligation to participate in it. It implies that adults whose\nturn has come are obligated to participate in clinical research,\nalthough for practical reasons we might refrain from forcing them to\ndo so.\n\nThis justification for clinical research faces several challenges.\nFirst, Rawlsian arguments typically are used to determine the basic\nstructure of society, that is, to determine a fair arrangement of the\nbasic institutions within the society (Rawls 1999). If the structure\nof society meets these basic conditions, members of the society cannot\nargue that the resulting distribution of benefits and burdens is\nunfair. Yet, even when the structure of society meets the conditions\nfor fairness, it does not follow that individuals are obligated to\nparticipate in the society so structured. Competent adults can decide\nto leave a society that meets these conditions rather than enjoy its\nbenefits (whether they have any better places to go is another\nquestion). The right of exit suggests that the fairness of the system\ndoes not generate an obligation to participate, but rather defends the\nsystem against those who would argue that it is unfair to some of the\nparticipants over others. At most, then, the present argument can show\nthat it is not unfair to enroll a given individual in a research\nstudy, that this is a reasonable thing for all individuals, including\nthose who are unable to consent.\n\nSecond, it is important to ask on what grounds individuals behind the\nveil of ignorance make their decisions. In particular: are these\ndecisions constrained or guided by moral considerations? (Dworkin\n1989; Stark 2000). It seems plausible to think that they would be.\nAfter all, we are seeking the ethical approach or policy with respect\nto clinical research. The problem, then, is that the answer we get in\nthis case may depend significantly on which ethical constraints are\nbuilt into the system, rendering the approach question begging. Most\nimportantly, we are considering whether it is ethical to expose\nindividuals who cannot consent to risks for the benefit of others. If\nit isn\u2019t, then it seems that this should be a limitation on the\nchoices individuals can make from behind the veil of ignorance, in\nwhich case appeal to those choices will not be able to\njustify pediatric research, nor  research with incompetent\nadults. And if this research is ethical it is unclear why we need this\nmechanism to justify it.\n\nProponents might avoid this dilemma by assuming that individuals\nbehind the veil of ignorance will make decisions based purely on\nself-interest, unconstrained by moral limits or considerations.\nPresumably, many different systems would satisfy this requirement. In\nparticular, the system that produces the greatest amount of benefits\noverall may well be one that we regard as unethical. Many endorse the\nview that clinical research studies which offer no potential benefit\nto participants and pose a high chance of serious risk, such as death,\nare unethical, independent of the magnitude of the social value to be\ngained. For example, almost all research ethicists would regard as\nunethical a study which intentionally infects a few participants\nwith the HIV virus, even when the study offers the potential to\nidentify a cure for AIDS. Yet, individuals behind the veil of\nignorance who make decisions based solely on self-interest might well\nallow this study on the grounds that it offers a positive cost-benefit\nratio overall: the high risks to a few participants are clearly\noutweighed by the potential to save the lives of millions.\n\nThe question here is not whether a reasonable person would choose to\nmake those who are badly off even worse off in order to elevate the\nstatus of those more privileged. Rather, both options involve some\nindividuals being in unfortunate circumstances, namely, infected with\nthe HIV virus. The difference is that the one option (not conducting\nthe study) involves many more individuals becoming infected over time,\nwhereas the other option involves significantly fewer individuals\nbeing infected, but some as the result of being injected in the\nprocess of identifying a cure. Since the least desirable circumstances\n(being infected with HIV) are the same in both cases, the reasonable\nchoice, even if one endorses the maximin strategy, seems to be\nwhichever option reduces the total number of individuals who are in\nthose circumstances, revealing that, in the present case at least, the\nRawlsian approach seems not to take into account the way in which\nindividuals end up in the positions they occupy.\n",
