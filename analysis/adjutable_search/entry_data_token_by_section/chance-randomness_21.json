    "main_text": "Chance, Randomness, and Determinism\n7. Chance, Randomness, and Determinism\n\n\nOne last hope for the thesis that chancy outcomes are random comes\nfrom the connection of both notions with indeterminism. Consider this\nargument:\n\\(\\mathbf{P1}\\):\n\nAn outcome happens by chance iff it is produced by an indeterministic\nprocess. \n\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{P2}\\):\n\nA possible sequence of outcomes is random iff a repeated\nindeterministic process could produce all of the outcomes.\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{RCT}\\):\n\nTherefore, an outcome happens by chance iff there is a possible random\nsequence of outcomes, produced by the same process, of which it is a\nmember.\n\n\n\nThis argument is valid. If the premises are true, we have a direct\nargument for RCT. We have no direct response to the objections raised\nin\n \u00a7\u00a74\u20135,\n but\nsomehow, if this argument succeeds, those objections must miss the\npoint. The premises have some initial plausibility (though P2 is\ndubious: surely a properly indeterministic process could produce any\nsequence of outcomes whatsoever, including many non-random sequences?\nWe discuss this further in\n \u00a77.2).\n The thesis\nthat indeterminism is necessary and sufficient for chance has long been\na popular claim. And randomness and indeterminism also seem to have a\nclose connection. But to evaluate them, we will need to be more precise\nthan we have been about determinism.\nEarman-Montague Determinism:\n\nA scientific theory is deterministic iff any two sequences of\nstates in models of that theory which share some state at some time\nshare every state at every time. A theory is indeterministic\niff it is not deterministic; equivalently, if two systems can be in the\nsame state at one time and evolve into distinct states. A system is\n(in)deterministic iff the theory which completely and correctly\ndescribes it (of which it is a model) is (in)deterministic. (Earman\n1986; Montague 1974)\n\n\nDeterminism so stated is a supervenience thesis: as Schaffer (2007:\n115) puts it, \u2018A world \\(w\\) is deterministic iff: for all\ntimes \\(t\\) in \\(w\\), the total occurrent history of\n\\(w\\) supervenes on the occurrent state of \\(w\\) at\n\\(t\\) together with the laws of \\(w\\).\u2019\n\n\nWith this in mind, we now evaluate the premises of this argument.\nThere seem to be significant doubts about both directions of both\npremises. The upshot is that indeterminism offers little comfort for\nthe defender of RCT.\n",
