Technology and the Production of Gender\n\nBernice Hausman's Changing Sex: Transsexualism, Technology,\nand the Idea of Gender (1995) aims to provide a feminist analysis\nof transsexuality within a Foucauldian paradigm. While her theoretical\nframework differs markedly from Raymond's, she also shares\nRaymond's concern about transsexuality as well as her deep\ndistrust of medical intervention on the body.\n\n\nFor Hausman, the primary hallmark of transsexuality is the sheer\ndemand for transsexual surgeries through which transsexual subjects are\nconstituted as such (1995, 110). As a consequence,\nshe sees transsexual subjectivity as entirely dependent upon medical\ntechnology. In Hausman's view, transsexuals and doctors work\ninterdependently to produce \u201cthe standard account\u201d of\ntranssexuality which serves as a \u201ccover\u201d for the demand for\nsurgery and to justify access to the medical technologies (110, 138\u20139).\nBehind the \u201ccover\u201d there is only the problematic demand to,\nthrough technology, engineer oneself as a subject. Because of this,\nHausman claims that transsexual agency can be \u201cread\nthrough\u201d the medical discourse (110).\n\n\nA corollary of her view is that the very notion of gender (as a\npsychological entity and cultural role distinguished from sex) is a\nconsequence of medical technology, and in part, the emergence of\ntranssexuality. Rather than arising as a consequence of sexist gender\nroles, Hausman argues, transsexuality is one of vehicles through which\ngender itself is produced as an effect of discourses designed to\njustify access to certain medical technology (140). In defending this\nposition, Hausman points to the historical emergence of the expressions\ngender and gender identity in the work of individuals\nsuch as John Money and Robert Stoller (discussed earlier). She sees\nsuch historical developments not as moments of intellectual discovery\nbut as discursive development. It is the precisely the development of\nthis new gender discourse which ushers in gender and gender identity.\nAnd such discourse is made possible, for Hausman, through the advance\nin technology which allows surgical treatment of intersex and\ntranssexual individuals. In effect, gender and gender identity\ndiscourse emerges as a way to motivate and justify the deployment of\ncertain medical technologies.\n\n\nIn light of this, Hausman critiques Butler for assuming an\nahistorical use of gender/sex in her attempt to read sex as\n\u201cgender all along.\u201d On the contrary, argues Hausman, gender\nwas a historical development (179). Prior to gender, argues Hausman,\nthe reproductive subject (i.e., woman or man understood within a\nheterosexual framework) was understood in terms of the body as\nsignifier of sex. With the development of gender, the reproductive\nsubject (now understood in terms of heterosexual gender role) is taken\nto signify gender identity (as the very ground for biological sex)\n(187\u201388). Hausman resists Butler's (1990) call to proliferate\ngenders, then, and insists instead on a return to the notion of sex\n(180).\n\nA significant component of Hausman's account is that transsexual\nagency is inherently complicit in the medical model (140). For Hausman,\ntranssexuals are defined by their desire for surgical conversion and\nhave their subjectivity constituted by and through medical accounts of\ntranssexuality. Beyond the medical model, no transsexual subjectivity\nis possible at all, according to Hausman. Whereas Stone (1991) sought\nto disrupt the traditional transsexual narrative by making room for the\nexperiences of transsexuals (captured in \u201cdouble vision\u201d)\nand by generating new hybrid (\u201cgenre-blending\u201d) narratives,\nHausman denies that there is anything further to be said (174).\nNotably, Hausman appears to misrepresent Stone as claiming that there\nis a single reality or truth to be told, concealed by the medical\nnarrative (146). However, she also appears to reject any possibility of\n\u201cdouble consciousness\u201d and of trans resistance to the\nmedical model (195\u20136). This rejection, however, is empirically false as\nis evidenced by Stone's observations about the subversive\nactivities in transsexual subculture (discussed above). Indeed, given\nthat Stone herself, a transsexual, seems capable of articulating an\naccount of self that exceeds and contests the medical model, it is\nunclear why and how Hausman can deny that resistant transsexual\nsubjectivity is possible.\n\nFor Hausman, transsexual autobiographies serve the function of\njustifying access to surgery through the deployment of medical\naccounts. The purpose of such narratives is to compel the reader to\ncomply with the author's experience and to interpret her own life\nin the same way (156). Indeed, Hausman argues, these very narratives\nbelie several contradictions and are actually self-defeating. For\nexample, Hausman notes a self-defeating tension between transsexual\nclaims to have always been \u201cthe other sex\u201d all along and\nthe related demand for \u201csex-change\u201d surgery (148). If one\nwas always that sex all along, then why sex-change surgery?\n\nIn response to this charge, Prosser (1998) argues that\nautobiographical narrative is essential to understanding transsexual\nsubjectivity (103).  In his view, autobiographical\nnarrative\u2014required by the clinician, and then perhaps re-visited\nthrough a formal autobiography\u2014allows transsexuals to confer\nintelligibility upon their lives.  Such accounts, Prosser points out,\nare always retrospective. And they involve a split between the\nnarrated self and the narrating self. Such tensions between claims to\nhaving always belonged to a sex (on the one hand) and of going through\na process of surgical sex-change (on the other) are simply\nconstitutive of the types of tensions that arise in autobiographical\nnarrative (1998, 114\u2013120).\n\nWhether or not Prosser is correct, however, Hausman's\nidentification of self-undermining tensions is weak. A claim to have\nalways belonged to a sex and a claim to have become a sex through\nsurgery are only in tension if \u2018sex\u2019 is used univocally in\nthe two claims. But it isn't clear that this is so. If claims to\nhave always belong to a sex are used to flag a gender identity and\nperhaps the sense that one ought to have born to the other sex (on the\none hand), while claims to have changed one's sex are used to\nflag bodily transformation (on the other hand), then there scarcely\nseems to be a self-defeating tension.\n\nHausman also briefly considers transgender politics as a possible\nsource of resistance to the medical conception of transsexuality. She\nrecognizes that the possibility of trans people working in a way that\nis at odds with the medical regulation of gender is at odds with her\nattempt to reduce transsexual subjectivity to complicity. In reply,\nhowever, Hausman sides with Raymond in affirming that the sheer mix-and-match of\ngender presentation does nothing to transcend gender, relying on an\nunacceptable view of gender as in some ways voluntary (197\u20138). She also\nnotes that Bornstein (whom she sees as representative of all current\ntransgender politics) continues to make room for transsexual identities\nand transsexual surgery, which she sees as fundamentally problematic\n(198). Even if Hausman is right that some transgender activists adopt\nthis position about transsexuals, however, she hasn't fully\naddressed the main point that there exist forms of trans subjectivity\nwhich outstrip the medical model. And while she is certainly right that\nnot all gender blending is subversive, it isn't clear why none\nis.\n\nOne of the notable outcomes of Hausman's work (as well as\nRaymond's new introduction to The Transsexual Empire),\nwas a heightened recognition among trans scholars of the fragility of\ntransgender studies. Concerned by the continuing transphobia inherent\nin some non trans feminist writers, C. Jacob Hale drafted\n\u201cSuggested Rules for Non-Transsexuals Writing about\nTranssexuality, Transsexualism, or Trans\u201d (1997) to assist\nnon-trans individuals in writing about trans people in ways that\navoided, rather than perpetuated, transphobic strategies and\nrepresentations.\n",
