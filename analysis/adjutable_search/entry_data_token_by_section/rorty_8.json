    "main_text": "Cultural Politics || Liberalism and Irony\n3.3 Liberalism and Irony\n\nRorty is a self-proclaimed postmodernist bourgeois liberal\n(\u201cPostmodernist Bourgeois Liberalism,\u201d ORT). His\nliberalism is postmodernist because it does not depend on a\nmetanarrative according to which liberalism is the realization and\nembodiment of transcultural and ahistorical conceptions of rationality\nand morality. Rather, its institutions and practices are the lucky\nresult of a contingent history. His liberalism is bourgeois because\nthis contingent history includes economic conditions that make these\ninstitutions and practices possible (see section 3.7).\n\nThus, his liberalism is a pragmatic liberalism. He is skeptical of\npolitical thought purporting to uncover hidden, systematic causes for\ninjustice and exploitation, and on that basis proposing sweeping\nchanges to set things right. (ORT Part III; EHO; CIS Part II; AOC).\nRather, liberalism involves piecemeal reforms advancing economic\njustice and increasing the freedoms that citizens are able to enjoy.\nIt is also a romantic liberalism. He follows Judith Shklar in\nidentifying liberals by their belief that \u201ccruelty is the worst\nthing we do,\u201d and contends it is our ability to imagine the ways\nwe can be cruel to others, and how we could be different, that enables\nus to gradually expand the community with which we feel solidarity\n(CIS, 146).\n\nIt is possible, Rorty thinks, to be both a liberal and an ironist. The\nironist, a figure Rorty contrasts with \u201cthe\nmetaphysician,\u201d is a central character in CIS. The metaphysician\nis someone who adheres to the \u201ccommon sense\u201d view that it\nis possible to discover the true nature of reality or the true nature\nof the self, whereas the ironist is someone who understands that any\nparticular description of reality or of the self that she might adopt\nwill be adopted only for contingent reasons, often having to do with\nher culture and upbringing. Because she recognizes that the\ndescriptions she uses are optional, she is often on the lookout for\nnew ways of describing things, particularly when she \u201chas\nradical and continuing doubts about the final vocabulary she currently\nuses\u201d (CIS, 73). Because she believes \u201cthere is nothing\nbeyond vocabularies which serves as a criterion of choice between\nthem\u201d (CIS, 80), these doubts can only be resolved by comparing\nalternative possible vocabularies. Thus, she seeks out different and\ncompelling descriptions that she can adopt or incorporate into her own\nfinal vocabulary.\n\nRorty\u2019s liberal ironist, recognizing \u2013 indeed, affirming\n\u2013 the contingency of her own commitments, is explicitly\nethnocentric (ORT, \u201cSolidarity or Objectivity\u201d). She\naccepts that bourgeois liberalism has no universality other than the\ntransient and unstable one which time, luck, and discursive effort\nmight win for it. Recognizing the contingency of these values and the\nvocabulary in which they are expressed, while retaining the\ncommitments, is the attitude of the liberal ironist (CIS, essays 3,4).\nLiberal ironists have the ability to combine consciousness of the\ncontingency of their own evaluative vocabulary with a commitment to\nreducing suffering \u2013 in particular, with a commitment to\ncombatting cruelty (CIS, essay 4, ORT, Part III).\n",
