    "main_text": "Relations\n3. Relations\n\nThe previous section outlined ways in which feminists have\nproblematized the idea that particular categories are\n\u201cnatural\u201d. Similarly, feminists have problematized the\nidea that particular categories are intrinsic or non-relational. The\ncritical charge, stated very generally, is that dominant frameworks\nfor representing the world, especially the social world, purport to\nclassify things on the basis of intrinsic properties when in fact the\nclassifications are crucially dependent on relational\n properties.[6]\n\nThere are two forms of this critique, and correspondingly, two kinds\nof response. On the first form, the charge is that dominant frameworks\nmisrepresent their subject matter by ignoring important relational\naspects of what they purport to be talking about. For example,\nfeminists have long charged that philosophical conceptions of the\nself, e.g., the conception of the independent rational self-regulator,\nare framed in atomistic terms, ignoring our inevitable and valuable\ndependence on each other. In response, feminists have urged us to\nrecognize and revalue the complexity of subjectivity not addressed in\nmodels of rational agency, and to incorporate in our understanding of\nthe self facts about the realities of human dependence and\ninterdependence for which women have been primarily responsible\n(Meyers 1997; Kittay 1999; Stoljar 2015; Willett et al. 2016).\n\nThe second form of such critique also alleges that the dominant\nframeworks misrepresent their subject matter by obscuring what\u2019s\nrelational. However, the goal is not to capture and revalue the\nbackground relations as in the first form of this critique, but to\nchallenge them. In the cases in question, the charge is that although\nthe system of classification appears to be sorting individuals on the\nbasis of intrinsic properties, in fact there are invidious relations\nthat are being masked by these appearances (Flax 1986: 199\u2013202).\nJust as there are reasons why dominant frameworks construct myths\nabout what\u2019s natural to justify subordinating practices,\nlikewise they construct myths about what\u2019s intrinsic.\n\nConsider again Beauvoir\u2019s claim that \u201cHe is the Subject,\nhe is the Absolute\u2014she is the Other\u201d. Part of what is at\nstake in Beauvoir\u2019s conception of women as Other is the idea\nthat our conceptions of gender and of the self are implicitly\nrelational, e.g., although it may seem that we can define what it is\nto be a woman without reference to men, in fact we cannot (Wittig\n1992; MacKinnon 1989; Haslanger 1993). For Beauvoir, very roughly,\nwomen are those positioned as \u201cAbsolute Other\u201d, i.e., as\n\u201cOther\u201d in relation to a group counting as\n\u201cSubject\u201d where the relation between these two groups\nnever reverses so the \u201cOther\u201d becomes\n\u201cSubject\u201d (Beauvoir [1949] 1989: xxii, also\nxv\u2013xxxiv). So, to be a woman is to stand in a complex set of\nsocial (and hierarchical) relations to men (mutatis mutandis\nfor men). And to be a Subject is to stand in a complex set of social\nrelations to some group of Others. For a nuanced recent account of\nBeauvoir\u2019s view of subjectification and objectification\u2019s\nrole in that see Bauer 2011.\n\nThese particular claims of Beauvoir\u2019s are, of course,\ncontroversial and would need further argument to be made plausible;\nbut the claims are less important than the general idea that\nrelations, especially social relations, are sometimes obscured by our\nordinary frameworks for thinking of things. This is of special\ninterest to feminists (and antiracists) for reasons linked to those we\nhave for questioning the representation of a category as\n\u201cnatural\u201d. Begin with a background assumption that social\nlife cannot help but accommodate what\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d.\nWe then can contribute to some category\u2019s appearing\n\u201cnatural\u201d by supposing that the basis for membership in\nthe category is intrinsic (thus obscuring the social relations that\nare the real basis for membership). In this context, pressure to\nchange or abolish the category seems unreasonable.\n\nThese critiques raised invite us to ask: how should we\nre-conceptualize the self and other parts of our social ontology? What\nis the relation between intrinsicness and naturalness? On what basis\ncan we claim that one framework is \u201cmasking\u201d another?\n",
