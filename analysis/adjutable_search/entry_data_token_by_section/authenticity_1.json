    "main_text": "Origins and Meaning of the Concept of Authenticity || Autonomy and Authenticity\n1.2 Autonomy and Authenticity\n\nThe growing appeal of the idea of authenticity has led to the\nemergence of a highly influential modern \u201cethic of\nauthenticity\u201d (Ferrara 1993; Ferrara 2017). This ethic\nacknowledges the value of the dominant \u201cethic of autonomy\u201d\nthat shapes modern moral thought (Schneewind 1998; Dworkin 1988). The\nidea of autonomy emphasizes the individual\u2019s self-governing\nabilities, the independence of one\u2019s deliberation from\nmanipulation and the capacity to decide for oneself. It is connected\nto the view that moral principles and the legitimacy of political\nauthority should be grounded in the self-governing individual who is\nfree from diverse cultural and social pressures. According to the\nethic of autonomy, each individual should follow those norms he or she\ncan will on the basis of rational reflective endorsement. To some\nextent, authenticity and autonomy agree in supposing that one should\nstrive to lead one\u2019s life according to one\u2019s own reasons\nand motives, relying on one\u2019s capacity to follow\nself-imposed guidelines. In both cases, it is crucial that\none has the ability to put one\u2019s own behavior under reflexive\nscrutiny and make it dependent on self-determined goals (Honneth\n1994).\n\nOne crucial difference is that the ethic of authenticity introduces\nthe idea that there are motives, desires and commitments that\nsometimes should outweigh the restrictions of rational reflection.\nThis is because those motives are so fundamental to the cohesion of\none\u2019s own identity that overriding them would mean\ndisintegrating the very self which is necessary to be a moral agent.\nThe point is that there are types of moral philosophical reasoning\nthat can be repressive if they arise from \u201can autonomous moral\nconscience not complemented by sensitivity to the equilibrium of\nidentity and by authenticity\u201d (Ferrara 1993: 102). Besides\nleading an autonomous life, guided by one\u2019s own, non-constrained\nreasons and motives, authenticity requires that these motives and\nreasons should be expressive of one\u2019s self-identity.\nAuthenticity guides the moral agent to follow only those \u201cmoral\nsources outside the subject [that speak in a language] which\nresonate[s] within him or her\u201d, in other words, moral\nsources that accord with \u201can order which is inseparably indexed\nto a personal vision\u201d (Taylor 1989: 510). Hence, authenticity\nentails an aspect that lies beyond the scope of autonomy, namely, a\n\u201clanguage of personal resonance\u201d (Taylor 1991: 90). This\npoints to the gap between (Kantian) autonomy and authenticity: one can\nlead an autonomous life, even if this way of living fails to express a\nperson\u2019s self-understanding.\n\nIn recent years, more attention has been devoted to highlighting how\nautonomy and authenticity can come apart (e.g. Oshana 2007; Roessler\n2012; MacKay forthcoming). Some argue that authenticity demands more\nthan is necessary for autonomy: a person does not have to reflectively\nendorse key aspects of her identity in order to qualify as autonomous\n(Oshana 2007). If she acknowledges that aspects of her identity\ncontradict her self-conception, she might still be autonomous, even if\nthis acknowledgement injects ambivalence into her life.\n\nIn all, the ideal of authenticity does not object to the importance of\nthe self-given law, but disagrees that full freedom consists in making\nand following such a law (Menke 2005: 308). It is not just about being\ninvolved in the authorship of such a law, but about how this law fits\nwith the wholeness of a person\u2019s life, and how or whether it\nexpresses who the person is. In this sense, the idea of autonomy\nalready represents a counterposition to an ethic that is solely\nconcerned with strict adherence to social norms.\n",
