    "main_text": "Embedded (or indirect) questions || Responsive, rogative, and anti-rogative predicates\n4.8 Responsive, rogative, and anti-rogative predicates\n\nKnowledge is only one of a broader category of attitudes corresponding\nto what Lahiri (2002) calls responsive predicates. It is\ncharacteristic of responsive predicates that they accept both\ninterrogative and declarative complements, as in \u2018Mary\nknows/remembers/forgets who runs\u2019 and \u2018Mary\nknows/remembers/forgets that John runs\u2019. Responsive predicates\ncontrast with what Lahiri (2002) calls rogative predicates,\nsuch as \u2018wonder\u2019, \u2018be curious\u2019, and\n\u2018inquire\u2019, and with what Theiler et al. (2019)\ncall anti-rogative predicates, such as \u2018suspect\u2019\nand \u2018hope\u2019. Rogative predicates accept interrogative\ncomplements but do not accept declarative complements. For example,\none can inquire who ate the last doughnut, but one cannot inquire that\nJohn ate the last doughnut. Anti-rogative predicates on the other\nhand, accept declarative complements but not interrogative\ncomplements. For instance, one can suspect that John ate the last\ndoughnut but one cannot suspect who ate the last doughnut. \n\nThe distinction between rogative and responsive predicates has\nepistemological significance, as it underlies Friedman\u2019s (2013)\nargument that there is a category of attitudes that have\nquestions, not propositions, as their contents. Friedman\ncalls these the interrogative attitudes, and they are\nprecisely the attitudes denoted by rogative predicates. \n\nWithin the category of responsive predicates Lahiri (2002, 287)\ndistinguishes the veridical from the non-veridical.\nVeridical-responsive predicates include \u2018know\u2019,\n\u2018remember\u2019, and \u2018forget\u2019;\nnon-veridical-responsive predicates include \u2018be certain\u2019,\n\u2018agree (about)\u2019, and \u2018conjecture (about)\u2019.\nWhereas a veridical-responsive predicate expresses a relation to the\ncorrect answer to its interrogative complement, a\nnon-veridical-responsive predicate expresses a relation to a possible\n(but not necessarily the correct) answer. For example, \u2018Jane\nremembers who won the lottery\u2019 entails that Jane has knowledge\nthat correctly answers the question \u2018Who won the\nlottery?\u2019, whereas \u2018Jane is certain about who won the\nlottery\u2019 entails that Jane is certain of the truth of a\nproposition that may or may not correctly answer that same question.\n\n\nRecent work in formal semantics has attempted to derive the fact that\nrogative predicates do not accept declarative complements and the fact\nthat anti-rogative predicates do not accept interrogative complements\nfrom independently observable semantic properties of such predicates\n(see, e.g., Theiler et al. 2019, Uegaki 2019, Roelofsen\n2019). \n",
