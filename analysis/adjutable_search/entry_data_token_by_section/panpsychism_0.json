    "main_text": "Panpsychism in the History of Western Philosophy\n1. Panpsychism in the History of Western Philosophy\nClear indications of panpsychist doctrines are evident in early Greek thought. One of the first Presocratic philosophers of ancient Greece, Thales (c. 624\u2013545 BCE) deployed an analogical argument for the attribution of mind that tends towards panpsychism. The argument depends upon the idea that enminded beings are self-movers. Thales notes that magnets and, under certain circumstances, amber, can move themselves and concludes that they therefore possess minds. It is claimed that Thales went much beyond such particular attributions and endorsed a true panpsychism and pantheism. For example, as reported by Barnes (1982: 96\u20137), Diogenes claimed that Thales believed that \u201cthe universe is alive and full of spirits\u201d, but this remark is derived from an earlier claim of Aristotle: \u201csome say a soul is mingled in the whole universe\u2014which is perhaps why Thales thought that everything is full of gods\u201d. While Barnes disputes the pantheistic reading of Thales, he allows that Thales believed in the \u201cubiquity of animation\u201d.[1]\nThe Presocratics were struck by a dilemma: either mind is an elemental feature of the world, or mind can somehow be reduced to more fundamental elements. If one opts for reductionism, it is incumbent upon one to explain how the reduction happens. On the other hand, if one opts for the panpsychist view that mind is an elemental feature of the world, then one must account for the apparent lack of mental features at the fundamental level. Anaxagoras (c. 500\u2013425 BCE) flatly denied that novel elements can emerge from more basic features of reality and instead advanced the view that \u201ceverything is in everything\u201d (there are interesting parallels between this and much more recent arguments for panpsychism by Thomas Nagel and Galen Strawson, discussed below). Anaxagoras explained the appearance to the contrary in terms of a \u201cprinciple of dominance and latency\u201d (see Mourelatos 1986), which asserted that some qualities were dominant in their contribution to the behavior and appearance of things. However, Anaxagoras\u2019s views on mind are complex since he apparently regarded mind as uniquely not containing any measure of other things and thus not fully complying with his mixing principles. Perhaps this can be interpreted as the assertion that mind is ontologically fundamental in a special way; Anaxagoras did seem to believe that everything has some portion of mind in it while refraining from the assertion that everything has a mind (even this is controversial, see Barnes 1982: 405 ff.).\nOn the other hand, Empedocles, an almost exact contemporary of Anaxagoras, favored a reductionist account based upon the famous doctrine of the four elements: earth, air, fire and water. All qualities were to be explicated in terms of ratios of these elements. The overall distribution of the elements, which were themselves eternal and unchangeable, was controlled by \u201clove and strife\u201d in a grand cyclically dynamic universe.[2] The purest form of reductionism was propounded by the famed atomist Democritus (c. 460\u2013370 BCE). His principle of emergence was based upon the possibility of multi-shaped atoms \u201cinterlocking\u201d to form an infinity of more complex shapes. But Democritus had to admit that the qualities of experience could not be accounted for in this way, and thus chose to relegate them to non-existence: \u201cby convention sweet and by convention bitter, by convention hot, by convention cold, by convention color; but in reality atoms and void\u201d (Taylor 1999).\nWhat is striking about these early attempts to formulate an integrated theory of reality is that the mind and particularly consciousness keep arising as special problems. It is sometimes said that the mind-body problem is not an ancient philosophical worry (see Matson 1966), but it does seem that the problem of consciousness was vexing philosophers 2500 years ago, and in a form redolent of contemporary worries.\nWe find these worries re-emerging at the start of the scientific revolution, as the mechanistic picture of the world inaugurated by Galileo, Descartes and Newton put the problem of the mind at center stage while paradoxically sweeping it under the rug. Galileo\u2019s mathematisation of nature seemed to leave no space for the qualities we find in experience: the redness of the tomato, the spiciness of the paprika, the sweet smell of flowers. Galileo\u2019s solution, in a move reminiscent of Democritus, was to strip matter of such sensory qualities. This led to the distinction between \u201cprimary qualities\u201d\u2014such as shape, size and motion\u2014which were thought to really exist in matter, and \u201csecondary qualities\u201d\u2014such as colours, odours and tastes\u2014which were thought to exist only in the mind of the observer (or to exist as powers to cause ideas in the minds of observers).[3] Galileo and Descartes did not take the radical Democritian step of denying the existence of the secondary qualities; instead they placed them in the soul.[4] However, this of course led to a radical form of dualism, with a sharp metaphysical division between souls with their secondary qualities and bodies with their primary qualities.\nIn opposition to this dualism, the panpsychist views of Spinoza (1632\u201377) and Leibniz (1646\u20131716) can be seen as attempts to provide a more unified picture of nature. Spinoza regarded both mind and matter as simply aspects (or attributes) of the eternal, infinite and unique substance he identified with God Himself. In the illustrative scholium to proposition seven of book two of the Ethics ([1677] 1985) Spinoza writes:\n\na circle existing in nature and the idea of the existing circle, which is also in God, are one and the same thing \u2026 therefore, whether we conceive nature under the attribute of Extension, or under the attribute of Thought \u2026 we shall find one and the same order, or one and the same connection of causes\u2026.\n\nWe might say that, for Spinoza, physical science is a way of studying the psychology of God. There is nothing in nature that does not have a mental aspect\u2014the proper appreciation of matter itself reveals it to be the other side of a mentalistic coin.\nLeibniz\u2019s view is sometimes caricatured as: Spinoza with infinitely many substances rather than just one. These substances Leibniz called monads (Leibniz [1714] 1989). Since they are true substances (able to exist independently of any other thing), and since they are absolutely simple, they cannot interact with each other in any way. Yet each monad carries within it complete information about the entire universe. Space, for Leibniz, was reducible to (non-spatial) similarity or correspondence relationships between the intrinsic natures of the monads.\nLeibniz\u2019s monads are fundamentally to be conceived mentalistically\u2014they are in a way mentalistic automatons moving from one perceptual state (some conscious and some not) to another, all according to a God imposed pre-defined rule. It is highly significant for the development of contemporary forms of panpsychism that Leibniz could find no intrinsic nature for his basic elements other than a mentalistic nature\u2014the only model he found adequate to describe his monads was one of perception and spontaneous activity. This view has been highly influential on the emergence in recent times of Russellian monism, discussed below.\nThe nineteenth century was the heyday of panpsychism. Even a partial list of panpsychists of that period reveals how many of the best minds of the time gravitated towards this doctrine. Prominent exponents of distinctive forms of panpsychism include Gustav Fechner (1801\u20131887), Wilhelm Wundt (1832\u20131920), Rudolf Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881), William James (1842\u20131910), Josiah Royce (1855\u20131916) and William Clifford (1845\u20131879). Royce and Lotze represent what may be called \u201cidealist panpsychism\u201d. That is, the primary motivation for the ascription of mental attributes to matter is that matter is, in essence, a \u201cform\u201d of mind, and thus panpsychism is a kind of theorem that follows from this more fundamental philosophical view.\nAn important figure in the development of panpsychist thought is Arthur Schopenhauer (1788\u20131860). Schopenhauer was influenced by Kant\u2019s view that we lack an understanding of reality as it is in and of itself, but he made a crucial exception for the immediate knowledge one has of oneself. Taking will to be the fundamental quality one is aware of in introspection, Schopenhauer thus theorised that will is the inner nature of all things. This line of reasoning bears a striking similarity to, and indeed is an important influence on, the contemporary Russellian monists, whom we will discuss below.\nOther panpsychists of this time include Friedrich Paulsen (1846\u20131908), a student of Fechner\u2019s who extended his teacher\u2019s version of panpsychism, and Morton Prince (1854\u20131929), psychologist and physician who advocated a panpsychism that emphasized that it is matter that must be \u201cpsychologized\u201d or imbued with mentalistic attributes (Prince regarded this as a form of materialism, and there are again affinities here with Russellian monism, discussed below). Also to be mentioned are Eduard von Hartmann (1842\u20131906) who extended his famous doctrine of the unconscious down to the level of atoms, Ferdinand C.S. Schiller (1864\u20131937) who provided a pragmatist defense of panpsychism as a doctrine which by various analogical arguments yields otherwise unattainable insights into nature, and Ernst H\u00e4ckel (1834\u20131919), an early and avid proponent of Darwinism in Germany who interpreted our evolutionary connection with the rest of nature as evidence for panpsychism, and who was thus willing to ascribe mental properties to living cells.\nFechner and Royce developed panpsychist accounts of nature that did not attribute mental properties to the smallest bits of matter. This might seem to exclude their being correctly classed as \u201cpanpsychists\u201d, as it is part of the definition of panpsychism that mentality is fundamental. Surely someone who believes that amoebas have experiences, but that the quarks and electrons that ultimately constitute amoebas do not, is no panpsychist. However, this simplifying view contains an implicit assumption about the nature of fundamental reality, namely that micro-level entities are its building blocks. Fechner and Royce did not accept this assumption, holding instead that the ontological foundation of reality is the \u201cworld-soul\u201d or \u201cworld-mind\u201d of which everything is a part (there are obvious echoes of Spinoza in such a view). This top-down view of the place of mind in the world does seem to be a legitimate sort of panpsychism, and it is one that does not require that everything in the world be itself enminded. Hartshorne (1950) labelled this kind of panpsychism \u201csynecological\u201d, in opposition to \u201catomistic\u201d panpsychism. In contemporary philosophy, these views are known respectively as \u201c(constitutive) cosmopsychism\u201d and \u201c(constitutive) micropsychism\u201d, and both have their defenders as we shall see below.\nWilliam James\u2019s panpsychism grew out of his \u201cneutral monism\u201d\u2014 the view that the fundamental nature of reality is neither mental nor physical, but of some third form that can be regarded as either mental or physical from different viewpoints. To the extent that a neutral monism can be regarded as a dual-aspect view (as in Spinoza\u2019s philosophy), it might be regarded as a kind of panpsychism in its own right; but James\u2019s view developed beyond this, to incorporate mind-like elements into the basic structure of reality. In a notebook of 1909 he wrote: \u201cthe constitution of reality which I am making for is of the psychic type\u201d (see Cooper 1990). James\u2019s commitment to panpsychism remains somewhat controversial, since he also advanced a cogent set of objections against a version of the view, which he labelled the \u201cmind dust\u201d theory, in chapter six of The Principles of Psychology ([1890] 1981). These objections are the inspiration for the so-called \u201ccombination problem\u201d, around which much of the twenty first century literature on panpsychism focuses. But in the end James\u2019s commitment is quite clear (see James 1909, 1911; Lamberth 1997; and for an excellent analysis of James\u2019s views on mind see Cooper 1990 or chapters 2\u20134 of Cooper 2002).\nThe most significant development and defense of a panpsychist philosophy in the twentieth century was undoubtedly that of Alfred North Whitehead (1861\u20131947).[5] Exploration of the details of Whitehead\u2019s philosophy would require an article of its own, and would be fraught with interpretive difficulties in any case since Whitehead\u2019s own presentation is forbiddingly complex. But roughly speaking Whitehead proposed a radical reform of our conception of the fundamental nature of the world, placing events (or items that are more event-like than thing-like) and the ongoing processes of their creation and extinction as the core feature of the world, rather than the traditional triad of matter, space and time. His panpsychism arises from the idea that the elementary events that make up the world (which he called occasions) partake of mentality in some\u2014often extremely attenuated\u2014sense, metaphorically expressed in terms of the mentalistic notions of creativity, spontaneity and perception. The echoes of Leibniz are not accidental here, and Whitehead also has a form of Leibniz\u2019s distinction between unities and mere aggregates, which he explains in these terms:\n\n\u2026 in bodies that are obviously living, a coordination has been achieved that raises into prominence some functions inherent in the ultimate occasions. For lifeless matter these functionings thwart each other, and average out so as to produce a negligible total effect. In the case of living bodies the coordination intervenes, and the average effect of these intimate functionings has to be taken into account. (1933: 207)\n\n(Lest it seem that Whitehead is only discussing life, he is clear that this depends upon a sort of mental functioning.)[6]\nFrom the 1930s to the end of the twentieth century, there was relatively little interest in panpsychism in Western philosophy. This attitude was arguably caused by two things: the dominance of physicalism in the philosophy of mind, and the general hostility to metaphysics which reigned up until the 1970s. A rare exception to this trend was Timothy Sprigge who, in A Vindication of Absolute Idealism (1983), defends an idealism-based form of panpsychism (see the entry on idealism). Sprigge summarized his views and provided some novel defences of them in Sprigge (2007), which is a response to critics, a number of which explicitly discuss panpsychism (see e.g., Maddell 2007). An important form of the anti-emergence argument for panpsychism (discussed below) was published by Thomas Nagel in 1979. Later David Griffin, in Unsnarling the World Knot (1998), espoused an atomistic panpsychism in the form of an explicit interpretation, extension and defense of Whitehead\u2019s version of the doctrine. We also find sympathy for panpsychism in David Chalmers\u2019 (1996) The Conscious Mind, and in articles responding to Chalmers by Piet Hut & Roger Shepard, Gregg Rosenberg, and William Seager, all in Shear 1997 (for more on the history of panpsychism see Clark 2004 and Skrbina 2005).\nRecent developments have gone some way to reversing the aversion to panpsychism that has dominated Western philosophy in recent times. From the 1970s onwards hostility to metaphysics slowly withdrew, and most philosophers in the analytic tradition now accept the inevitability of metaphysics. And towards the end of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, the continuing failure of physicalists to come up with a satisfying account of consciousness has led many to look for alternatives. As a result of both of these things, a significant and growing minority of analytic philosophers have begun seriously to explore the potential of panpsychism, both to provide a satisfying account of the emergence of human consciousness and to give a positive account of the intrinsic nature of matter (these motivations should become clearer in the discussion below of the arguments for panpsychism). The following volumes include some of this recent work: Freeman 2006; Skrbina 2009; Blaumauer 2011; Alter & Nagasawa 2015; Br\u00fcntrup & Jaskolla 2016; Seager 2020; Goff & Moran 2021.\n",
