Best Interests\n\nIf children are not thought to have the A-rights, and, chiefly, do not\nhave the liberty rights to choose for themselves how to conduct their\nlives, nevertheless they are not morally abandoned to their own\ndevices. In the first place, it is a standard principle of child\nwelfare law and policy that the \u2018best interests\u2019 of a\nchild should be promoted. Article 3.1 of the United Nations Convention\non the Rights of the Child states that \u2018In all actions\nconcerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social\nwelfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or\nlegislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary\nconsideration\u2019 (United Nations 1989).\n\nSecond, Article 12.1 of the Convention asserts that, \u2018States\nParties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her\nown views the right to express those views freely in all matters\naffecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in\naccordance with the age and maturity of the child\u2019 (United\nNations 1989).\n\nSection 9 discusses the right to be heard. This section discusses the\nbest interest principle, henceforward the BIP. The discussion is brief\nfor the following reason: Article 3 does not accord to children a\nright to have their best interests protected and promoted. Indeed, it\ndoes not use the word \u2018right\u2019. The Article does impose on\nStates parties an obligation to ensure that all relevant organizations\nand legislative bodies make the best interests of children a relevant\nconsideration. However, the BIP sits oddly besides the other\nenumerated rights.\n\nMoreover, the BIP has been subject to numerous criticisms (Kopelman\n1997; Parker 1994) and claims of ambiguity, chief amongst which are\nthe following. First, the weight given to best interests can be\nvariously specified, a choice between \u2018primary\u2019 or\n\u2018paramount\u2019 being a significant one which preoccupied\nthose drafting the Convention. (Alston 1994 12). Second, there is an\nimportant difference between its use in respect of \u2018a\u2019\n(that is some particular) child and of \u2018children\u2019 (as a\nclass of humans). Third, it is implausible to view the BIP as\nrequiring that one must act \u2018so as to promote maximally the\ngood\u2019 of the child (Buchanan and Brock 1989, 10). Construed in\nliterally maximising terms (rather than merely what is good enough),\nthe BIP is unfeasibly demanding of agencies charged with the care of\nchildren. Fourth, the BIP does not, as it stands, take account of the\ninterests of others. We cannot be required to promote the best\ninterests of a child over and above, and without regard to, the\ninterests of any relevant adult.\n\nFifth, the interpretation of \u2018best interests\u2019 is unclear:\nit could be specified as what a child would choose for herself under\nspecified hypothetical circumstances; or what is, as a matter of fact,\nbest for the child, an account which is distinct from and independent\nof the child\u2019s desires, actual or hypothetical. If it is the\nlatter then, some argue, we cannot with certainty determine what is\nbest for a child. We cannot in practice make complete and accurate\nassessments of what will be the outcome of each and every policy\noption that we might adopt in respect of a child (Mnookin 1979). The\nBIP is indeterminate even where there are only two possible decisions\nto be made (Elster 1989, 134\u2013139). Such indeterminacy is\ncompounded and complicated by the fact of moral pluralism (Rawls 1993,\nxvi-xvii), whereby individuals subscribe to different conceptions of\nwhat makes life valuable. If we cannot agree how to rank as better or\nworse different kinds of life, we will not be able to agree what is\nbetter or best for the growing child. The fact of extensive\ndisagreement about what is best for children, or for a child, is often\nset in the context of broader cultural disagreements about morality in\ngeneral. It is said that the BIP is subverted, or at least rendered\ndeeply problematic, by the existence of these deep and pervasive\ncultural disagreements (Alston (ed.) 1994).\n\nIf we understand the BIP in terms of a child\u2019s hypothetical\nchoices, the most striking and influential thought is that we should\nchoose what is best for the child as the child would choose for\nherself if the child were adult. For instance, John Rawls thinks the\nfollowing formulation defines the acceptable paternalism of a\nguardian\u2019s treatment of his child: \u2018We must choose for\nothers as we have reason to believe they would choose for themselves\nif they were at the age of reason and deciding rationally\u2019\n(Rawls 1999, 183). This apparently simple formulation is in fact\nsusceptible of at least two quite different interpretations, each of\nwhich brings with it its own problems. In each case, we are seeking to\nspecify the adult person who chooses for the child.\n\nWe might, first, mean that we should choose for this child as the\nadult the child will become would choose. However, this does not\ndetermine a unique choice for, crucially, the nature of the adult that\nthe child will become precisely depends on the choices that are made\nfor it whilst a child. We can conceive of each of the different adult\nselves the child might develop into approving, respectively, of the\ndifferent choices made for its childhood self\u2014choices which were\nresponsible for the development of these different selves. Or, second,\nthe adult person who chooses for the child is an adult analogue of the\nchild. This is not the child\u2019s future adult self, which as we\nhave seen is indeterminate, but this child made into an adult version\nof itself. That is, we do not imagine this child developing in the\nfuture into its adult self. Rather we imagine a mature or grown-up\nversion of this child now making choices. This interpretation however\nwill still not work. The adult version of the child is one with\nchildish beliefs and desires filtered out. But, in the first place, it\nis not clear what remains of the child in any choice situation\nrendered hypothetical in this fashion. For the child just is someone\nwho has these childish beliefs and desires. What is it to be a child\nif not to think and want as a child does? Second, it is entirely\nindeterminate what should replace these beliefs and desires.\n\nHowever, in the case of children, by contrast with adults, we cannot\ncash out the various hypothetical conditionals. We do not know what a\nchild would choose if possessed of adult rational powers of choice,\nbecause what makes a child a child just is its lack of such powers\n(its ignorance, inconstant wants, inconsistent beliefs, and limited\npowers of ratiocination). At the same time, we cannot ask how an adult\nwould choose if in the child\u2019s situation just because an adult\nwould not be in that situation, or would not be in a child\u2019s\nsituation. We must, it seems, choose for a child because a child\ncannot choose for itself, and we must choose what is best for a child\nnot what some imagined adult version of the child would choose for\nitself.\n\nTo repeat, the BIP, despite its importance, is not a child\u2019s\nright. Moreover, as well as being beset by these various problems, it\nis also arguably in tension with some of the other rights a child has.\nIn particular, the obligation to do what is best for the child stands\nagainst an obligation to give serious consideration to a child\u2019s\nown view of what is in their interests. This requirement is discussed\nin Section 9.\n",
