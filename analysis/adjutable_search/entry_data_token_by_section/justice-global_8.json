    "main_text": "The Proper Use of Force, Military Intervention, and its Aftermath || War and Just Conduct\n3.1 War and Just Conduct\n\nWithin the field of global justice, issues concerning war have one of\nthe longest histories. The just war framework has been influential in\nsetting the terms of much debate about the proper use of force in\ninternational affairs. Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine and Thomas Aquinas\noffered some of the earliest accounts of the criteria that should be\nmet for war to be justified. Two areas have been especially thoroughly\nstudied: (1) the conditions under which entry into the war is\njustified (Jus Ad Bellum) and (2) the conditions for fair conduct\nwithin the war (Jus In Bello). While having a just cause is standardly\nheld to be a necessary condition for a war to be justified, it is not\nsufficient. Theorists often disagree about which additional conditions\nmust be satisfied for a war to be characterized as a just war. The\nmost common additional conditions proposed are that the war should be\nundertaken by a proper authority, with the right intentions, when the\nwar would follow requirements of proportionality (the ends to be\nsecured would warrant going to war), only as a last resort, and when\nthere are reasonable prospects of success. On traditional accounts of\njust war theory all conditions must be met, while several theorists\nchallenge whether they are all necessary (Mellow 2006; Moellendorf\n2002; Walzer 1983).\n\nOnce the fighting begins two central principles guide evaluation of\nwhether the war is being conducted fairly: one which respects the\ndistinction between combatants and noncombatants (The Principle of\nNon-Combatant Immunity) and another that governs what counts as the\nproportional use of force (Proportionality). On the first, it is not\nlegitimate to use force against civilians and, even though some\ncollateral civilian damage may occur, it is wrong to deliberately\ntarget non-combatants. On the second, combatants may only use the\nforce necessary to achieve their ends \u2013 the force used must be\nproportional to the ends that are to be secured in conducting the war.\nThere are further requirements governing fairness, such as\nrequirements to comply with international laws and treat prisoners\nfairly, but the two featured principles are the most commonly invoked\nin normative analyses of Jus In Bello.\n\nThe third part of just war theory (Jus Post Bellum) concerns\nhow the war concludes and the transition back to a situation of peace\n(Bass 2004, Rodin 2008). It deals with issues such as compensation,\npunishment, and reform (Ohlin 2014). A fourth component has been\nsuggested especially in light of engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan\nin the years 2001\u20132011, namely, justice in exiting the war\n(Jus Ex Bello), which concerns when it is appropriate to end\na war (Moellendorf 2008; Rodin 2008).\n\nThere are many contemporary global justice issues concerning the\nappropriate use of force (and its aftermath) that currently command\nattention including: Is drone warfare (or any kind of warfare)\npermissible? Can terrorism ever be justified? Are \u201ctargeted\nassassinations\u201d (where leaders who are primarily responsible for\ndecisions to go to war are targeted for assassination) justifiable?\nMay we engage in a war in order to prevent an anticipated \u201cworse\nwar\u201d? Is torture to contain major global threats permissible? Is\nthe attempt to contain nuclear weapons development by those who have\nthem already fraught with hypocrisy? How should we deal best with\nsocieties in a state of transitional justice? Is there a place for\n\u201cTruth and Reconciliation Committees\u201d (Walker 2006)? When\nare political apologies for historic injustice in warfare appropriate?\nSome suggest that the changing nature of combat has fundamentally\naltered the ethics of war, for instance emphasizing how individuals\ncan be held morally accountable for their participation and actions\ncontributing to unjust wars (Ryan 1983; McMahan 2009; Pfaffe 2020;\nOhlin 2014; Reitan 2018). Scholars also consider different ways to\nengage in defensible non-militaristic international reform\ninterventions (Rafanelli 2021).\n\nHere we consider very briefly only two further issues that continue to\nattract widespread current interest in the global justice literature:\nHumanitarian Intervention and Terrorism. See the entry on\n terrorism\n for an extended analysis of such questions. See the entry on\n war\n for a comprehensive overview of issues concerning justice in war.\n",
