    "main_text": "Stirner\u2019s Life and Work\n1. Stirner\u2019s Life and Work\n\nStirner was born Johann Caspar Schmidt on 25 October 1806, the only\nchild of lower middle class Lutheran parents living in Bayreuth.\n\u201cStirner\u201d was originally a nickname, resulting from a\nlarge forehead, exaggerated by the way he pushed back his hair, and\nonly later \u2014 in the form of \u201cMax Stirner\u201d \u2014\nadopted as a literary pseudonym and his preferred name. His father had\ndied when Stirner was only six months old, and he was brought up by\nhis mother (who subsequently remarried) and then later, when his\nmother moved from Bayreuth, by an aunt who looked after him in order\nthat he could continue his schooling at the renowned local Gymnasium.\nStirner subsequently pursued his undergraduate studies, with little\nacademic distinction, at the universities of Berlin, Erlangen, and\nK\u00f6nigsberg. In Berlin, he is known to have attended three\nlecture-series given by G.W.F. Hegel (1770\u20131831): on the\nphilosophy of religion; on the history of philosophy; and on the\nphilosophy of \u201csubjective spirit\u201d (which concerns\nindividual psychology, including thinking and the will).\n\nTowards the end of his university career, Stirner devoted much of his\ntime to \u201cfamily affairs\u201d, possibly a euphemism for his\nmother\u2019s deteriorating mental health. In 1832, he returned with\nhis mother to Berlin, and sought, with qualified success, to train as\na teacher. (Stirner\u2019s mother was committed to a mental home in\n1837 and she would eventually outlive him by three years.) A period of\nprivate study and irregular work followed, including eighteenth months\nworking unpaid as an Latin teacher. During this time he married Agnes\nButz (1815\u20131838), a member of his landlady\u2019s family. In\nAugust 1838, Agnes died giving birth to a still-born child. Edgar\nBauer (1820\u20131886) would later maintain that Stirner had once\ntold him that, having caught sight of his first wife naked, he was\nunable to touch her again.\n\nBetween 1839 and 1844 Stirner maintained something of a double life in\nBerlin. He obtained a position at a well-regarded private girls\u2019\nschool, and spent the next five years teaching history and literature,\nestablishing a reputation as a polite and reliable teacher in the\nprocess. Away from his teaching post, however, Stirner began to\nfrequent the more avant-garde of Berlin\u2019s intellectual haunts.\nHe used the reading room of the novelist Willibald Alexis\n(1798\u20131871), spent afternoons at the Caf\u00e9 Stehely, and\nfrom 1841 onwards was a regular visitor to Hippel\u2019s wine bar on\nthe Friedrichstrasse. The last of these was the main meeting place of\n\u201cthe free\u201d, an increasingly bohemian group of teachers,\nstudents, officers, and journalists, under the loose intellectual\nleadership of the left-Hegelian Bruno Bauer (1809\u20131882). The\nlatter had recently been dismissed from his teaching post at the\nUniversity of Bonn, following an official inquiry into the orthodoxy\nof his writings on the New Testament. This unconventional group\nincluded Marie D\u00e4hnhardt (1818\u20131902) who became\nStirner\u2019s second wife (and the dedicatee of The Ego and Its\nOwn). In this bohemian environment, and despite his calm and\nunassuming personal appearance, Stirner gained a reputation for his\nhostility to religion, intolerance of moderation, and ability to\nprovoke fierce argument.\n\nStirner\u2019s earliest published writings date from this time in\nBerlin. In addition to some short and unremarkable pieces of\njournalism for the Rheinische Zeitung and the Leipziger\nAllgemeine Zeitung, these writings include a knowing review of\nBruno Bauer\u2019s anonymous and parodic attack on Hegel in The\nTrumpet of the Last Judgement (1842), and an article on pedagogy\nentitled \u201cThe False Principle of Our Education\u201d (1842).\nThe latter, in particular, adumbrates some of the themes of\nStirner\u2019s own later work; for example, contrasting the training\nof individuals to an alien calling, on the one hand, with the\ncultivation of the predisposition to become \u201csovereign\ncharacters\u201d, on the other. During this period, Stirner is said\nto have occasionally alluded to a book that he was working on, but few\nof his associates took its existence seriously. The impact of The\nEgo and Its Own on these left-Hegelian circles was considerable\nas well as unexpected. Stirner had begun serious work on the book in\nearly 1843 and finished it in the middle of 1844. The Ego and Its\nOwn was published by the Leipzig bookseller Otto Wigand\n(1795\u20131870) in an edition of a thousand copies. Although dated\n1845 the book was widely available by November of the previous\nyear.\n\nMeasured by the reaction that it produced, The Ego and Its\nOwn might be described as a critical success. The book was widely\nreviewed, and attracted attention from well-known figures such as\nBettina von Arnim (1785\u20131859), the doyenne of the Berlin\nliterati, and Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907), later a distinguished\nneo-Kantian historian of philosophy. The book also generated responses\nfrom many of its left-Hegelian targets; Bruno Bauer, Ludwig Feuerbach\n(1804\u20131872), Moses Hess (1812\u20131875), Arnold Ruge\n(1802\u20131880), and others, all ventured into print in order to\ndefend their own views against Stirner\u2019s polemic. (Stirner\nreplied to some of these left-Hegelian rejoinders in an article\nentitled \u201cStirner\u2019s Critics\u201d [1845].)\n\nHowever, The Ego and Its Own was neither a popular nor a\nfinancial success. Stirner had left his teaching post shortly before\nthe book was published, and by 1846 he was reduced to advertising in\nthe Vossische Zeitung for a loan. By then, Stirner had also\nsquandered much of his second wife\u2019s inheritance (losing money\non a failed dairy business), and she left him towards the end of the\nsame year. Many years later Marie D\u00e4hnhardt was traced to England\nby Stirner\u2019s loyal biographer, the poet and novelist John Henry\nMackay (1864\u20131933). She refused to meet Mackay in person but\nwrote to him characterising Stirner as a very sly man whom she had\nneither respected nor loved, and describing their relationship\ntogether as more of a cohabitation than a marriage.\n\nFrom 1847, Stirner\u2019s life was characterised by social isolation\nand financial precariousness. He remained detached from contemporary\nevents \u2014 for example, he seems to have largely ignored the\nrevolutions of 1848 \u2014 and his daily life was dominated by\ndomestic routine and economic hardship. Stirner continued to write\nintermittently, but commentators have generally found his later work\nto be of little independent interest; that is, of little interest\napart from its disputed potential to illuminate The Ego and Its\nOwn. He translated into German some of the economic writings of\nJean-Baptiste Say (1767\u20131832) and Adam Smith (1723\u20131790),\nand may have written a series of short journalistic pieces for the\nJournal des oesterreichischen Lloyd. In 1852, he published a\nHistory of Reaction in two parts; a work consisting mainly of\nexcerpts from other authors \u2014 including Edmund Burke\n(1729\u20131797) and Auguste Comte (1898\u20131857) \u2014 excerpts\nwhich are not always easily distinguished from his own occasional\ncommentary. Its intellectual purpose remains uncertain, although there\nare some continuities with Stirner\u2019s critical account of\nrevolution in The Ego and Its Own (Stepelevich 2021:\n161\u2013169). Stirner\u2019s main strategy for economic survival in\nthis period seems to have involved repeatedly changing addresses in\norder to evade his creditors, although not quickly enough to avoid two\nbrief periods in a debtors\u2019 prison in 1853 and 1854.\n\nIn May 1856, still living in reduced circumstances in Berlin, Stirner\nfell into a \u201cnervous fever\u201d, seemingly after being stung\nin the neck by an insect. Following a brief remission, he died on 25\nJune (aged 49 years and 8 months). His death went largely unnoticed by\nthe outside world.\n\nIt might look as if there is a stark contrast between the often\nmelodramatic and provocative tone of Stirner\u2019s best-known work,\non the one hand, and the more mundane, sometimes poignant, events of\nhis own solitary life, on the other. However, commentators often\nstrive to link his life and philosophical views more closely. John\nHenry Mackay, for example, emphasizes the\n\u201cataraxic\u201ddimension of The Ego and Its Own, and\nportrays Stirner\u2019s life as an authentic embodiment of the\nemotional detachment that the egoist must cultivate in order to avoid\nbeing enslaved by their own passions and commitments. Even the pathos\nof Stirner\u2019s death is said to reflect the egoist\u2019s refusal\nto love life, or fear death, excessively (Mackay 1914: 212). Such\nclaims are not without interest, but the lack of direct evidence\nregarding Stirner\u2019s own interior life makes them difficult to\nevaluate and endorse.\n",
