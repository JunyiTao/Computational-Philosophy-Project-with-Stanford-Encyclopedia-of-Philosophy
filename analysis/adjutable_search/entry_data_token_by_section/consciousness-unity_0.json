    "main_text": "History\n1. History\n\nThe unity of consciousness was a main concern of most philosophers in\nwhat is often called the \u2018classical modern era\u2019 (roughly,\n1600 to 1900), including Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Hume (in a way; see\nbelow), Reid, Brentano, and James. \n\nConsider a classical argument of Descartes\u2019 for mind-body\ndualism. It starts like this:\n\n\nWhen I consider the mind, that is to say, myself inasmuch as I am only\na thinking thing, I cannot distinguish in myself any parts, but\napprehend myself to be clearly one and entire. [Descartes 1641: 196]\n\n\n\nDescartes then asserts that if the mind is not made of parts, it\ncannot be made of matter because anything material has parts. He adds\nthat this by itself would be enough to prove dualism, had he not\nalready proven it elsewhere. Notice where it is that I cannot\ndistinguish any parts. It is in \u201cmyself inasmuch as I am only a\nthinking thing\u201d (ibid.); that is, in myself as a\nwhole\u2014which requires unified consciousness of myself as a whole.\nThe claim is that this subject, the target of this unified\nconsciousness, is not a composite of parts. \n\nIn Kant (1781/7), the notion that consciousness is unified is central\nto his \u2018transcendental deduction of the categories\u2019 (see\nthe entry on\n Kant\u2019s view of the mind and consciousness of self\n for a fuller treatment of Kant). There Kant claims that in order to\ntie various objects of experience together into a single unified\nconscious experience of the world, we must be able to apply certain\nconcepts to the items in question. In particular, we have to apply\nconcepts from each of four fundamental categories of concept:\nquantitative, qualitative, relational, and what he called\n\u2018modal\u2019 concepts. Kant\u2019s attempt to link the unity\nof consciousness to the structure of knowledge continues to capture\nthe imaginations of philosophers: Arguments of this form can be found\nin P. F. Strawson (1966), Cassam (1996), Hurley (1994, 1998) and\nRevonsuo (2003), and are examined critically in\n Section 7.3\n and in Brook (2005). \n\nKant was familiar with arguments of the kind that we just saw\nDescartes mount (chiefly from similar reasoning in Leibniz and\nMendelssohn) but he was not impressed. For Kant, that consciousness is\nunified tells us nothing about what sorts of entity minds are,\nincluding whether or not they are made out of matter (1781, chapter on\nthe Paralogisms of Pure Reason). He argues that the achievement of\nunified consciousness by a system of components acting together would\nbe no more or less mysterious than its being achieved by something\nthat is simple, i.e., has no components (1781: A352).\n\nLeibniz, Hume, Reid, Brentano, and James held a variety of positions\non unity. Briefly, for Leibniz (see the entry on\n Leibniz\u2019s philosophy of mind)\n unified consciousness and the noncompositeness, the indivisibility\nthat he took to be required for it seem to have served as his model of\na monad, the building block of all reality. With Hume (1739), things\nare more complicated. It should have followed from his atomism that\nthere is no unified consciousness, just \u201ca bundle of different\nperceptions\u201d ([1739] 1962: 252). Yet, in a famous appendix, he\nsays that there is something he cannot render consistent with his\natomism (p. 636). He never tells us what it is but it may have been\nthat consciousness strongly appears to be more than a bundle of\nindependent \u2018perceptions\u2019. Reid (1785), almost an exact\ncontemporary of Kant\u2019s, made extensive use of the unity of\nconsciousness, among other things to run Descartes\u2019 argument\nfrom unity to indivisibility the other way around. Brentano (1874)\nargued that all the conscious states of a person at a time will and\nperhaps must be unified with one another. (He combined this view with\nanother strong thesis, that all mental states are conscious.) Finally,\nlate in the 19th century James developed a detailed\ntreatment of synchronic (or \u2018at a time\u2019) unity of\nconsciousness. We will discuss his view later (see also entries on\n David Hume,\n Thomas Reid,\n Franz Brentano,\n and\n William James).\n \n\nEarly in the 20th century, the unity of consciousness\nalmost disappeared from the research agenda. Logical atomism in\nphilosophy and behaviourism in psychology had little to say about the\nnotion. Logical atomism focussed on the atomic elements of cognition\n(sense data, simple propositional judgments, protocol sentences,\netc.), rather than on how these elements are tied together to form a\nmind. Behaviourism urged that we focus on behaviour, the mind being\neither a myth or at least something that we cannot and do not need to\nstudy in a science of the human person. \n\nOne partial exception to this pattern of neglect was Gestalt\npsychology. Indeed, Gestalt psychology was sufficiently influential in\nits time that some positivists tried to make their systems compatible\nwith it (Smith 1994: 23). For instance, Carnap chose to avoid any\ncommitment to atoms of experience as the elements of his system,\nopting instead for \u2018total experiences\u2019. As we will see, a\nnotion similar to his concept of irreducible experiential wholes can\nbe fruitful\n (Section 7.4).\n However, Carnap seems to have had something rather different in mind\nfrom what philosophers now have in mind when they speak of the unity\nof consciousness. Gestalt unity is a unity in a structure of which one\nis conscious, where the way in which each part appears is derived from\nthe structure of the whole (Tye 2003: 11\u20135; Bayne & Chalmers\n2003: 27). This is distinct from unity in one\u2019s\nconsciousness of objects, objects that need not themselves\nexhibit the qualities of gestalt structures.\n\nAfter decades of neglect, the last third of the 20th\ncentury saw a resurgence of interest in unified consciousness among\nanalytic philosophers. It began with influential commentaries on Kant\nin the 1960s (Strawson 1966; Bennett 1966, see also his 1974), as well\nas discussions by Nagel (1971) and Parfit (1971, 1984). More recently,\nquite a number of philosophers and a few psychologists have written on\nthe subject, including Marks (1981), Trevarthen (1984), Lockwood\n(1989, 1994), Hill (1991), Brook (1994), Marcel (1994), Hurley (1994,\n1998), Shoemaker (1996, 2003), O\u2019Brien and Opie (1998). The first\ndecades of the 21st century have seen a lot of important\nnew work on the subject: Dainton (2000), Stevenson (2000), Bayne and\nChalmers (2003), Hurley (2003), Kennett and Matthews (2003), Rosenthal\n(2003), Radden (2003),\nTye (2003), Zeki (2003), Nikolinakos (2004), Brook and Raymont (2006),\nLaRock (2007), and Bayne (2008, 2010, the latter a book-length study).\nCleeremans (2003) is an excellent collection containing papers by\nphilosophers such as Bayne, Chalmers, Hurley, Shoemaker, Cotterill,\nand Thompson and psychologists such as Triesman, Humphreys, Engel,\nDiennes, Perner, and Varela. Blackmore (2004, especially ch. 17) is a\ngood, scientifically-oriented introduction. The section on the unity\nof consciousness in PhilPapers has 391 entries (as of April 2017), the\nvast majority from the last twenty years (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n",
