Are Enhancements Dehumanizing?\nIn the background of the debates over both the boundaries of\nmedicine and the ethics of self-improvement looms a third important\nset of philosophical concerns, which are about the implications of new\nbiomedical enhancement interventions for our common understanding of\nhuman nature and the future of our species. Critics emphasize\n\u201cdystopian nightmares\u201d and worry that enhancement\ninterventions may rob us of central normative features of our identity\nas human beings (Mehlman 2012). Enhancement enthusiasts, on the other\nhand, embrace the possibility that biomedicine might change human\nnature for the better, and some even look forward to the emergence of\nthe trans-humans or post-persons as the next step in (intentionally\ndirected) human evolution (Bostrom 2003; Harris 2007). At stake in\nthese debates is whether, or how much, normative weight to assign\nfeatures of the human condition that have traditionally been taken as\ngiven (e.g., the families into which we are born and our natural\ntalents and abilities) or inevitable (such as, pain and ageing).\nMoral philosophy has a long history of making normative appeals to\nhuman nature. There are thorny philosophical issues about whether such\nappeals are ever legitimate. Even since David Hume warned us not to\nderive an \u201cought\u201d from an \u201cis\u201d, philosophers\nhave been wary of making strong inferences about what ought to be done\ndirectly from claims about human nature. However, the tradition of\nvirtue ethics is much more comfortable with adopting a naturalistic\napproach that holds that human nature is the basis for what\nconstitutes human well-being and the virtues (for human beings)\n(Fitzgerald 2008; Keenan 1999). Explaining what is worth cherishing\nabout being human is an intuitive starting point for making sense of\nourselves, our relationships with other human beings, and the world\naround us. The task of getting clear about what we do and should value\nabout being human has important implications for the ethics of\nbiomedical enhancements.\nThree features of human nature are at the center of many debates about\nthe ethics of biomedical enhancement. The first feature is human\nvulnerability. According to one prominent view, human beings are\ncreatures that suffer, age and die, and our struggle to deal with this\nvulnerability is a central aspect of what makes human life valuable\n(Parens 1995). There are several sub-groups within the group of\ntheorists that emphasize the value of vulnerability in understanding\nthe value of being human. The first group consists of \u201clife cycle\ntraditionalists\u201d who criticize ambitions to control the human\nageing process and extend the human life span (Callahan 1995). The\nsecond group consists of the \u201cpersonalists\u201d, who valorize\nthe way in which human limitations are humbling and encourage modesty\n(Fitzgerald 2008). The third group consists of\n\u201cpsychopharmaceutical Calvinists\u201d who discourage easy fixes\nto melancholy and sadness (Elliot 1998). The second feature of\nhuman nature that is emphasized in these debates is discussed by\nspecies preservationists and environmentalists who stress our\nembodiment and place in nature alongside other organisms: \u201cby\nnature\u201d, we are biological creatures of a particular family,\ndefined by painfully evolved \u201cspecies barriers\u201d, and\nenhancements that blur or bend those boundaries by \u201cdirecting\nevolution\u201d do so at our peril (McKibben 2004). The third feature\nof human nature that is often discussed in these debates is our\nsociality. According to these theorists, human beings are social\ncreatures that relate to one another through a complex nexus of\ninterpersonal commitments and hierarchical structures (Liao 2006a; Liao\n2006b). Many sports theorists see the \u201cvirtuous perfection of\nnatural talents\u201d as the goal of athletic competitions. If one\naccepts this view, then victories fueled by biomedical enhancements\nthat subvert the natural interpersonal hierarchies that genetic\ndisparities in talent create can literally \u201cdehumanize\u201d\nsport (Tolleneer, Steryck and Bonte 2013).\nEach family of theories described above that emphasizes a feature\nof human nature as the basis for its position in the enhancement\ndebate utilizes a tool that is double-edged. As defenders of\ntrans-humanism point out, each feature of human nature that can\nproduce positive value for humans can just as easily be a source of\nhuman misery, which the history of technological progress has been\nlegitimately concerned with alleviating (Juengst 2004). In fact, the\nenthusiasts argue, there are no static features of the human\ncondition: human vulnerabilities to our environment have steadily\ndecreased over history, our moral kinship communities have expanded,\nand our tolerance for oppressive forms of social organization has\ndwindled (Bostrom 2003). Accordingly, to appeal to these features of\nhuman nature in abstraction cannot be helpful in deciding which\nvulnerabilities to honor, which family loyalties to respect, and which\nsocial arrangements to defend and develop. Where a biomedical\nintervention alters one of these dimensions of human nature, this is a\nsignal that the moral stakes are high. But those stakes are not always\nabout what might be lost from the human experience. There are also\nmoral dangers in what might be perpetuated, if we allow the\npreservation of these hallmarks of human nature to overshadow our\nother values.\nOne popular response to the enthusiasm of the trans-humanists is to\ndraw a line against interventions that might take their recipients out\nof our biological species altogether. This is usually framed as a\nminimal proposal to ban the clearest possible cases of immoral\nmanipulation, on which everyone could agree. From proponents of\n\u201cresponsible genetics\u201d (Council for Responsible Genetics\n1993) to defenders of our \u201cgenetic patrimony\u201d as the\n\u201ccommon heritage of all humanity\u201d (Knoppers 1991), to the\n\u201canti-post-humanist\u201d life cycle traditionalists, the\nprospect of \u201cspecies altering experiments\u201d which might\n\u201cdirect\u201d human evolution is provoking resistance (Mehlman,\n2012).\nA classic example of this resistance is the appeal for a UN\nconvention on genetic technologies framed in terms of \u201cthe\npreservation of the human species\u201d (Annas, Andrews, and Isasi\n2002). Its advocates claim that any intervention that would\n\u201calter the essence of humanity itself by taking human evolution\ninto our own hands and directing it toward the development of a new\nspecies sometimes termed the \u201cpost-human\u201d should be\nconsidered a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d because it would\nundermine the \u201cfoundation of human rights\u201d and set the\nstage for human extinction.\nOf course, species are not static collections of organisms that can\nbe \u201cpreserved\u201d against change like a can of fruit; they\nwax and wane with every birth and death and their genetic complexions\nshift across time and space (Robert and Bayliss 2003; Juengst\n2017). In our case, almost everything we do as humans has\nramifications on that process. To argue that everyone has the right to\ninherit \u201can untampered genome\u201d only makes sense if we are\nwilling to take a snap-shot of the human gene pool at some given\ninstant, and reify it as the sacred \u201cgenetic patrimony of\nhumankind\u201d\u2014which some come close to doing (cf. Mauron and\nThevoz 1991). \nThere is a risk here of confusing the biological sense of\n\u201chuman\u201d as an taxonomic term (like \u201ccanine\u201d or\n\u201csimian\u201d) and the word\u2019s normative use, as in\n\u201chuman rights\u201d. In the biological sense,\n\u2018human\u2019 refers to the biological species homo\nsapiens and to be human is to be a member of this biological\nspecies. In the evaluative sense, \u2018human\u2019 refers to a\nproperty that is the basis for having certain moral rights and a\nparticular kind of moral value. Obviously it is not enough to be\nbiologically human to enjoy human rights: human tissue cultures and\nhuman cadavers show us that. Is it even necessary to be biologically\nhuman to enjoy what we call human rights? There are many candidates for\nthe natural qualities that are the basis for moral rights, but none\nhinge on a biological designation. So why is it that interventions that\n\u201calter the species\u201d \u201cmight cause the affected\nchildren to be deprived of their human rights\u201d?\nOther opponents of directed evolution extend the argument\nfurther. They acknowledge that post-humans may be capable of\nclaiming the same natural rights as humans by virtue of their\ncapacities, but argue that creating such a species would challenge the\nnotion that being human is sufficient for claiming those rights, in the\nsame ways that discovering rational extraterrestrials would. This, in\nturn, would potentially disenfranchise the humans, like infants or the\nmentally disabled, who cannot show adequate functional capacities to\nqualify for equivalent species-neutral moral status. At the same\ntime, they argue, if the post-humans actually have expanded capacities,\nthey may claim natural rights to a proportionately expanded range of\nopportunities and freedoms, beyond those to which normal humans are\nentitled. This runs the risk of creating the kinds of oppressive\nhierarchical society against which human rights are supposed to be the\nantidote, and, potentially, to the return of coercive eugenic programs\naimed at the eventual extinction of the human species (Fukuyama, 2002;\nMehlman, 2012). \nOthers point out that while the conceit that our human species\ncould be preserved forever is as absurd as the hope of individual\nimmortality, those facts provide no reason to accelerate either\nsenescence or evolution (Robert and Baylis, 2003; Agar 2013). Even in\nthe face of the inevitability of a post-human species, they argue, we\nare justified in protecting our (admittedly)\n\u201cspecies-relativist\u201d values by rejecting enhancements that\nwould serve to alienate their recipients from their former selves,\ntheir families, and their communities. Normal evolutionary processes\nprovide the luxury of time for human populations to\n\u201cnegotiate\u201d their adaptations with the environments that\nprovoke them. Leaving evolution to these normal processes can thus\nensure that our evolution is both as deliberate and as tentative as\nour species\u2019 technological history\u2014and also that it is\nlike technological history in that key \u201cthreshold\u201d changes\ncan only be seen retrospectively. From this perspective, the danger is\nthe abrupt provocation of biological speciation which radical\nenhancements might provoke, if they created reproductive barriers\nbetween the enhanced and the unenhanced. However, given that almost\nnone of the single capacity enhancement interventions under\ndiscussion\u2014cognitive, physical, moral, etc. \u2014are likely to\nimmediately produce biological reproductive barriers in otherwise\nspecies-typical enhanced humans, it is not clear whether the\nintroduction of even the most \u201calienating\u201d enhancements\nwould create this risk. \nFinally, just as it is metaphysically impossible to\n\u201cpreserve\u201d our species from further evolution, it is\nimpossible for us to control the process \u201cfrom the inside\nout\u201d, because the genetic constitution of our species is shaped\nby environmental forces of selection beyond human abilities to control\nor even, as the phenomenon of emerging epidemics continues to\nillustrate, anticipate. Moreover, as disability studies scholars point\nout, humanity is in no better place to decide which human traits\ndeserve promotion today than during the heyday of the Eugenics\nmovement, even if society could tolerate the kinds of reproductive\npolicies it would require to manage just the human part of the\nevolutionary equation. The striking correspondence between the\naspirations of old style Eugenicists and some proposals of\ncontemporary Transhumanists, unfortunately, provides some evidence to\nback up this claim (Sparrow 2011). Such proposals assume that some\ngenotypes represent \u201cjewels in the genome\u201d (Sikela 2006)\nwhile others constitute a form of expensive \u201ctoxic waste\u201d\nthat could and should be cleansed from the gene pool (Buchanan, Brock,\nWikler, and Daniels 2000). According to critics of transhumanism, this\nway of thinking reduces the identities of people to their genotypes,\nand undermines our commitment to the moral equality of people despite\ntheir biological diversity (Asch and Block 2011).\nAs hard as they are to rationally reconstruct, it is important to\nlisten to concerns that some form of biomedicine violates\nhuman nature, even in public discussions of policy within a\npluralistic society. Whether the concern is the distortion of some\nconstant of the human condition, like senescence, or a \u201cspecies\naltering\u201d threat to our collective gene pool, or the corruption\nof practices designed to celebrate the inherited human traits we value\nmost, these appeals all signal that the intervention in question has\ndeep implications for who we want to be, given who we have\nbeen. However, respecting what we have (or have not) inherited from\nour parents does not in itself fulfill the need to decide which\npromises we would like to make to our children. Invocations of\nparticular vulnerabilities, loyalties, or forms of sociality from the\npast can provide fodder for arguing over the positive visions of human\nnature that should guide those promises. But in communities that\naccept the possibility of a pluralism of promises, such invocations\nshould also trigger another policy-making response: the need for\npolicy-makers to protect the interests of those excluded from their\nvisions, even while we discuss their merits. The natural human gene\npool has no top, bottom, edges or direction: it cannot be \u201cused\nup\u201d, \u201cdiverted\u201d, \u201cpurified\u201d or\n\u201cpolluted\u201d. The reservoir of human mutual respect, good\nwill and tolerance for difference, however, seems perennially in\ndanger of running dry. That is our human nature\u2019s truly fragile\nheritage that we should seek to preserve\u2014and some say even\nenhance\u2014in monitoring biomedical research on behalf of the\nfuture.\n",
