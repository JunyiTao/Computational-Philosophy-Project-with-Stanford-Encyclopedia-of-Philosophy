    "main_text": "Some varieties of definition || Explicative definitions\n1.5 Explicative definitions\n\nSometimes a definition is offered neither descriptively nor\nstipulatively but as, what Rudolf Carnap (1956, \u00a72) called, an\nexplication. An explication aims to respect some central uses\nof a term but is stipulative on others. The explication may be offered\nas an absolute improvement of an existing, imperfect concept. Or, it\nmay be offered as a \u201cgood thing to mean\u201d by the term in a\nspecific context for a particular purpose. (The quoted phrase is due\nto Alan Ross Anderson; see Belnap 1993, 117.)\n\nA simple illustration of explication is provided by the definition of\nordered pair in set theory. Here, the pair \\(\\langle x,y\\rangle\\) is\ndefined as the set \\(\\{\\{x\\}, \\{x,y\\}\\}\\). Viewed as an explication,\nthis definition does not purport to capture all aspects of the\nantecedent uses of \u2018ordered pair\u2019 in mathematics (and in\nordinary life); instead, it aims to capture the essential uses. The\nessential fact about our use of \u2018ordered pair\u2019 is that it\nis governed by the principle that pairs are identical iff their\nrespective components are identical: \n\\[ \\langle x, y\\rangle = \\langle u, v\\rangle \\text{ iff } x = u \\amp y = v. \\]\n\n\nAnd it can be verified that the above definition satisfies the\nprinciple. The definition does have some consequences that do not\naccord with the ordinary notion. For example, the definition implies\nthat an object \\(x\\) is a member of a member of the pair \\(\\langle x,\ny\\rangle\\), and this implication is no part of the ordinary notion.\nBut the mismatch is not an objection to the explication. What is\nimportant for explication is not antecedent meaning but function. So\nlong as the latter is preserved, the former can be let go. It is this\nfeature of explication that led W. V. O. Quine (1960, \u00a753) to\nextol its virtues and to uphold the definition of \u201cordered\npair\u201d as a philosophical paradigm.\n\nThe truth-functional conditional provides another illustration of\nexplication. This conditional differs from the ordinary conditional in\nsome essential respects. Nevertheless, the truth-functional\nconditional can be put forward as an explication of the ordinary\nconditional for certain purposes in certain contexts. Whether\nthe proposal is adequate depends crucially on the purposes and\ncontexts in question. That the two conditionals differ in important,\neven essential, respects does not automatically disqualify the\nproposal.\n",
