    "main_text": "Frege\u2019s Philosophy of Language\n3. Frege\u2019s Philosophy of Language\n\n\nWhile pursuing his investigations into mathematics and logic (and\nquite possibly, in order to ground those investigations), Frege was\nled to develop a philosophy of language. His philosophy of language\nhas had just as much, if not more, impact than his contributions to\nlogic and mathematics. However, Bobzien (2021) offers compelling\ndocumentation suggesting that significant elements of Frege\u2019s\nphilosophy of language were adapted from Stoic logic.  In this\nsection, therefore, we first rehearse a key element of Frege\u2019s\nphilosophy of language, namely, the distinction between sense\nand denotation.  To motivate this distinction, we go through\nthe two key puzzles Frege attempted to solve (Section 3.1) and then\nexamine how the distinction between the sense and denotation of terms\n(and sentences) solve these puzzles (Section 3.2). Finally, we attempt\nto put Frege\u2019s philosophy of language in context (Section 3.3), in\nlight of new research arguing for the significant influence that\n(discussions of) Stoic texts had on his ideas.\n",
