    "main_text": "Grammatical criteria\n2. Grammatical criteria\n\n\nQuine and Dummett propose that the logical constants of a language\nare its grammatical particles\u2014the expressions by means\nof which complex sentences are built up, step by step, from atomic\nones\u2014while non-logical expressions are the simple expressions of\nwhich atomic sentences are composed (see Quine 1980, Quine 1986,\nDummett 1981, 21\u20132, and for discussion, F\u00f8llesdal 1980 and\nHarman 1984). On this conception, \u201c[l]ogic studies the truth conditions\nthat hinge solely on grammatical constructions\u201d (Quine 1980,\n 17).[4]\nThis criterion yields appropriate results when applied to the language\nof first-order logic (FOL) and other standard logical languages. In FOL\n(without identity), all singular terms and predicates are\nparadigm nonlogical constants, and all operators and\nconnectives are paradigm logical\n constants.[5]\n\n\nHowever, this nice coincidence of intuitively logical expressions and\ngrammatical particles in FOL cannot be taken as support for the\nQuine/Dummett proposal, because FOL was designed so that its\ngrammatical structure would reflect logical structure. It is easy\nenough to design other artificial languages for which the grammatical\ncriterion gives intuitively inappropriate results. For example, take\nstandard FOL and add a variable-binding operator \u201c\u00a2\u201d whose\ninterpretation is \u201cthere is at least one cat such that \u2026.\u201d The\ngrammatical criterion counts \u201c\u00a2\u201d as a logical constant, but\nsurely it is not one.\n\n\nMoreover, there are alternative ways of regimenting the grammar of\nFOL on which the standard truth-functional connectives are not\ngrammatical particles, but members of a small lexical category (Quine\n1986, 28\u20139). For example, instead of recognizing four grammatical\noperations that form one sentence from two sentences (one that takes\n\\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) and yields \\(\\cq{P \\vee Q}\\), one\nthat takes \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) and yields \\(\\cq{P \\and Q}\\), and so\non), we could recognize a single grammatical operation that forms one\nsentence from two sentences and one connective. On this way of\nregimenting the grammar of FOL, \\(\\dq{\\and}\\) and\n \\(\\dq{\\vee}\\)\n would not count as grammatical particles.\n\n\nThe upshot is that a grammatical demarcation of logical constants will\nnot impose significant constraints on what counts as a logical\nconstant unless it is combined with some principle for limiting the\nlanguages to which it applies (excluding, for example, languages with\nthe operator \u201c\u00a2\u201d) and privileging some regimentations of their\ngrammars over others (excluding, for example, regimentations that\ntreat truth-functional connectives as members of a small lexical\ncategory).  Quine\u2019s own approach is to privilege the language best\nsuited for the articulation of scientific theories and the grammar\nthat allows the most economical representation of the truth conditions\nof its sentences. Thus the reason Quine holds that logic should\nrestrict itself to the study of inferences that are truth-preserving\nin virtue of their grammatical structures is not that he thinks there\nis something special about the grammatical particles (in an arbitrary\nlanguage), but rather that he thinks we should employ a language in\nwhich grammatical structure is a perspicuous guide to truth\nconditions: \u201cwhat we call logical form is what grammatical form\nbecomes when grammar is revised so as to make for efficient general\nmethods of exploring the interdependence of sentences in respect of\ntheir truth values\u201d (1980, 21).\n\n\nInstead of applying the grammatical criterion to artificial\nlanguages like FOL, one might apply it to natural languages like\nEnglish. One could then appeal to the work of empirical linguists for a\nfavored grammatical regimentation. Contemporary linguists posit a\nstructural representation called LF that resolves issues of scope and\nbinding crucial to semantic evaluation. But the question remains which\nlexical items in the LF should count as logical constants. Generalizing\nQuine\u2019s proposal, one might identify the logical constants with members\nof small, \u201cclosed\u201d lexical categories: for example, conjunctions and\ndeterminers. However, by this criterion prepositions in English would\ncount as logical constants (Harman 1984, 121). Alternatively, one might\nidentify the logical constants with members of functional\ncategories (including tense, complementizers, auxiliaries,\ndeterminers, and pronouns), and the nonlogical constants with members\nof substantive categories (including nouns, verbs, adjectives,\nadverbs, and prepositions) (for this terminology, see Chomsky 1995, 6,\n54 and Radford 2004, 41). If a distinction that plays an important role\nin a theory of linguistic competence should turn out to coincide (in\nlarge part) with our traditional distinction between logical and\nnonlogical constants, then this fact would stand in need of\nexplanation. Why should we treat inferences that are truth-preserving\nin virtue of their LF structures and functional words differently from\nthose that are truth-preserving in virtue of their LF structures and\nsubstantive words? Future work in linguistics, cognitive psychology and\nneurophysiology may provide the materials for an interesting answer to\nthis question, but for now it is important that the question be asked,\nand that we keep in mind the possibility of a sceptical answer.\n",
