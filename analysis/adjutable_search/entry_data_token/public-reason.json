It is an\nidea with roots in the work of Hobbes, Kant, and Rousseau, and has\nbecome increasingly influential in contemporary moral and political\nphilosophy as a result of its development in the work of John Rawls,\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas, and Gerald Gaus, among others. Proponents of\npublic reason often present the idea as an implication of a particular\nconception of persons as free and equal. Each of us is free in the\nsense of not being naturally subject to any other person\u2019s moral\nor political authority, and we are equally situated with respect to\nthis freedom from the natural authority of others. How, then, can some\nmoral or political rules be rightly imposed on all of us, particularly\nif we assume deep and permanent disagreement amongst persons about\nmatters of value, morality, religion, and the good life? The answer,\nfor proponents of public reason, is that such rules can rightly be\nimposed on persons when the rules can be justified by appeal to ideas\nor arguments that those persons, at some level of idealization,\nendorse or accept. But public reason is not only a standard by which\nmoral or political rules can be assessed: it can also provide\nstandards for individual behavior. Because we make moral and political\ndemands of each other, if we are to comply with the ideal of public\nreason, we must refrain from advocating or supporting rules that\ncannot be justified to those on whom the rules would be imposed. We\nshould instead, some insist, only support those rules we sincerely\nbelieve can be justified by appeal to suitably shared or public\nconsiderations\u2014for example, widely endorsed political values\nsuch as freedom and equality\u2014and abstain from appealing to\nreligious arguments, or other controversial views over which\nreasonable people are assumed to disagree. In this way, public reason\ncan be presented as a standard for assessing rules, laws,\ninstitutions, and the behavior of individual citizens and public\nofficials.\n\nThis entry is structured around questions about the nature of public\nreason that continue to be the subject of sustained debate in the\nliterature. Section 1 considers competing positions regarding the\nunderlying rationale for public reason. Section 2 identifies different\nviews about the appropriate scope of public reason. Does it apply to\nall moral rules, only to political rules, or only to some sub-set of\npolitical rules? Section 3 considers the question of public\nreason\u2019s constituency: to whom must our rules be justifiable in\norder to be considered legitimate or authoritative? The next question,\nin section 4, concerns the content of public reason; in particular, to\nwhat extent is this content determined via a process of philosophical\nreflection as opposed to actual moral deliberation? Section 5\nconsiders the structure of public reason, with particular focus on\nwhether public reason requires some shared perspective or set of\nconsiderations, or whether it can be achieved without any common moral\nor political perspective. Section 6 addresses the site of public\nreason: where do its norms properly apply and when do they regulate\nindividual conduct? Section 7 identifies some of the most influential\nobjections that have been pressed against the idea of public reason,\nand Section 8 concludes with a brief survey of a few further\ntopics.\n", "toc": [{"#WhyPubRea": "1.

Why Public Reason?\n\nThe idea of public reason appears to inhabit a middle ground between\ntwo more familiar standards of evaluation in moral and political\nphilosophy. On the one hand, there is consent. Some political\nphilosophers, for example, argue that political legitimacy requires\nthe actual or implied consent of the governed (Otsuka 2003,\n89\u2013113; Simmons 1999). On the other hand, there is\ntruth: we can simply ask whether any alleged moral or\npolitical principle is true. Public reason does not aim either at\nconsent or truth. Public reason instead requires that our moral or\npolitical principles be justifiable to, or reasonably acceptable to,\nall those persons to whom the principles are meant to apply. An\naccount of public reason must find some way of giving the perspective\nof individual persons a significant role, without allowing this to\ncollapse into consent: public reason is not simply a way of\nidentifying those principles to which people already consent. But\nequally, public reason must not define those principles that could be\njustified to, or be acceptable to, each person as simply those\nprinciples that are true. In either case, the idea of public reason\nwould do no independent work.\n\nThis apparent middle ground between consent and truth may seem\npuzzling in several respects. One puzzle is whether there is, in fact,\na coherent and stable way of explicating the notion of reasonable\nacceptability or justification (Raz 1990, 46; Enoch, 2015). But even\nif we assume the idea of public reason is coherent, we can plausibly\nask why we ought to accept this idea, that is, what is the basis for\nadopting public reason as the relevant standard to evaluate rules and\nto govern individual conduct? This section considers five different\nanswers to this question (these answers can, of course, also be\ncombined). It is helpful to begin by considering these different\npositions regarding the basis of public reason, since how one chooses\nto answer this question often has direct implications for the scope,\nconstituency, content, site, duties, and structure of public reason\n(see Billingham and Taylor 2020).\n\nEach of the positions below is usually combined with an assumption\nabout pluralism or reasonable disagreement over a wide range of moral,\nethical, and other philosophical matters. That is, virtually all\nproponents of public reason assume that there is deep and intractable\ndisagreement amongst some people, and this disagreement is not simply\nthe result of irrationality, prejudice, or self-interest, but rather\narises as a result of the normal functioning of human reasoning under\nreasonably favorable conditions. This assumption about pluralism or\ndisagreement is an essential part of the rationale for public reason\nsince without it, it is difficult to understand why our moral or\npolitical principles ought to be justifiable or acceptable to others,\nas opposed to simply true or correct. The most influential conception\nof such pluralism or disagreement is Rawls\u2019s account of the\nburdens of judgment and the subsequent fact of reasonable\npluralism (Rawls 1996, 36\u201337, 55\u201357), though this\naccount is controversial, and has been subject to extensive criticism\n(e.g. Galston 2002, 46\u201347; Gaus 1996, 131\u2013136; Wenar 1995,\n41\u201348).\n1.1 Rationality and Morality\n\nSome philosophers present the idea of public reason, or the public use\nof reason, as an essential and central part of the nature of rational\ndiscourse about moral norms. Habermas\u2019s influential account of\ndiscourse ethics (Habermas 1990; Habermas 1996) has been presented by\nsome as grounding a conception of public reason in this way. On this\nview, the validity of moral and political norms can only be\nestablished by an intersubjective and idealized practice of\nargumentation. Only through an inclusive and noncoercive discursive\nprocess where all participants are equally situated can genuinely\nintersubjectively valid norms emerge. Habermas thus proposes a\ndialogical principle of universalization, (U), stating that a moral\nnorm \u201cis valid just in case the foreseeable consequences and\nside-effects of its general observance for the interests and\nvalue-orientations of each individual could be\njointly accepted by all concerned without\ncoercion\u201d (Habermas 1998, 42). For Habermas, this principle\nfollows from the presuppositions of rational moral discourse. Thus, at\nleast on one interpretation, to engage in reasoned moral or political\nargument with others is to commit oneself to something like the idea\nof public reason\u2014to commit oneself to finding norms that could\nbe jointly accepted by all concerned without coercion. On this\naccount, public reason is grounded in the nature of reasoned moral\nargument: one cannot, without contradiction, avoid the idea of public\nreason insofar as one wants to engage in reasoned moral or political\nargument with others.\n\nAlthough Habermas\u2019s account of discourse ethics has been\ninfluential amongst those who favor some version of discursive or\ndeliberative democracy (Bohman 1996; Chambers 1996; Dryzek 1990;\nDryzek 2000), its capacity to serve as the basis for public reason is\nthe subject of a number of criticisms. Perhaps most importantly, by\ngrounding public reason in a broader account of truth, validity, and\nrational argument, public reason becomes tied to a specific and\ncontroversial philosophical doctrine. But some proponents of public\nreason believe its role is to serve as a mechanism of justification\namongst persons who reasonably disagree about philosophical and other\nissues typically embedded in what Rawls calls comprehensive\ndoctrines (Rawls 1996, 13). If one believes the idea of public\nreason should stand apart from any particular comprehensive doctrine\nor philosophical theory of truth and rationality, the appeal to the\npresuppositions of rational discourse will be a problematic basis for\npublic reason (see Rawls 1996, 376\u2013381).\n\nOthers, most notably Gaus, argue that the idea of public reason\nfollows from certain basic features of our everyday moral practices\nand reactive attitudes, along with certain claims about the nature of\nreasons (Gaus 2011). On this view, social morality involves a\nparticular kind of interpersonal relationship; one where we claim the\nstanding to make demands of others, and where, under the right\nconditions, we acknowledge the standing of others to make demands on\nus (Gaus 2011, 184). But for this sort of relationship to exist, we\nmust believe that when we make moral demands of others, those others\nhave sufficient reasons to comply with our demands\u2014if they did\nnot have sufficient reasons to comply, then the reactive attitudes\nthat form an essential part of the interpersonal relationship of\nsocial morality would cease to make sense (Gaus 2011, 205\u2013232).\nIf, as Gaus maintains, different people have different reasons\ndepending on their differing epistemic positions and sets of justified\nbeliefs, the practice of making moral demands of others must involve\npublic reason: the moral demands we make on others must be justifiable\nto those others by appeal to reasons they have, and not simply by\nappeal to the truth as we see it.\n\nAlthough it differs from discourse ethics in important respects, this\naccount also promises to ground public reason in a broader account of\nthe nature of social morality and epistemology. It is thus also\nvulnerable to similar worries about whether public reason ought to be\nembedded in a comprehensive and controversial philosophical theory of\nmorality and epistemology. For criticisms of the effort to\njustify public reason in part by appeal to the reactive attitudes see\n(Tahzib 2019; Taylor 2018).\n1.2 Autonomy\n\nOn one prominent view, with both Kantian and Rousseauvian roots,\nfreedom requires that we obey only those laws or rules that we could\nrationally give to ourselves. To be subject to the will of others, or\nto the arbitrary forces of nature, is to be unfree. We thus express\nour nature as rational and autonomous beings by acting in accordance\nwith maxims that we could will to be universal laws, or we express our\npolitical autonomy by acting in accordance with those laws that appeal\nonly to the common good, and thereby represent the general will of all\ncitizens. Insofar as one holds this conception of autonomy to be of\nfundamental importance, autonomy might thus provide the basis for\npublic reason. By ensuring that our moral or political principles are\njustifiable or reasonably acceptable to all those to whom the\nprinciples apply, public reason appears to ensure that each of us is,\nin some important sense, governed only by principles that we can\nrationally give to ourselves. Some leading philosophers of public\nreason appear to make this connection between public reason and\nautonomy. Gaus, for example, appeals to Rousseau\u2019s statement\nthat the fundamental problem to which the social contract is meant to\nbe the solution is to find a way of imposing rules to regulate our\ncommon life \u201cin which each, while uniting himself with all, may\nstill obey himself alone, and remain as free as before\u201d (Gaus\n2011, 1. Also see Rawls 1996, 219; Neufeld 2022).\n\nBut the extent to which the appeal to autonomy can, on its own,\njustify the various features of public reason is uncertain, and many\nproponents of public reason do not explicitly present the appeal to\nKantian or Rousseauvian autonomy as the sole, or even primary, basis\nfor public reason. This may be partly explained by the fact that this\nconception of our autonomy, particularly insofar as it is presented as\npart of a broader account of our nature as rational beings, is\ncontroversial and the subject of reasonable disagreement (Weithman\n2002, 188\u2013191; Quong 2013). But for an attempt to develop an\nexplicitly political and civic account of autonomy with which to\nground public reason see (Neufeld 2022).\n1.3 Coercion and Respect\n\nA widely endorsed view regarding the moral basis of public reason\nappeals to a particular conception of what it means to treat others\nwith the respect they are due. On this view, we treat others as mere\nmeans, and not as ends, when we coerce them on the basis of reasons or\narguments that they could not reasonably accept. Charles Larmore, for\nexample, argues \u201cto respect another person as an end is to\nrequire that coercive or political principles be as justifiable to\nthat person as they presumably are to us\u201d (Larmore 1999, 608).\nConversely, \u201cif we try to bring about conformity to a rule of\nconduct solely by the threat of force, we shall be treating persons\nmerely as means, as objects of coercion, and not also as ends,\nengaging with their distinctive capacity as persons\u201d (Larmore\n1999, 607. Also see Larmore 2002 and Nagel 1987). Public reason is\npresented as the way of ensuring that our coercion of others is\nconsistent with respecting others as ends: we do this by ensuring our\ncoercive actions and institutions can be justified to all those who\nare the subjects of coercion. For a different appeal to respect, one\nthat is alleged to render the idea of public reason at least\nintelligible (rather than ground the idea) see (van Wietmarschen\n2021).\n\nBy grounding public reason in an account of how coercion can be\nsuitably respectful, this view limits the scope of public reason in\nways that may seem troubling. Not all laws and political institutions\nare coercive, and yet some noncoercive political institutions may seem\nappropriate topics of public reason. For example, which forms of\nmarriage, if any, ought to be granted legal recognition, or how the\nproceeds of a state-run lottery ought to be spent, might seem\nimportant topics of public reason, but fall outside the scope of\npublic reason on this basis (Bird 2014; Quong 2013). A related worry\nis this: if coercive actions uniquely stand in need of public\njustification, then this may make it difficult, or even impossible,\nfor the state to legitimately pursue many goals that are widely\nperceived to be permissible (Lister 2010; Lister 2013).\n1.4 Community or Civic Friendship\n\nAn alternative, though largely neglected, basis for public reason\nappeals to the importance of a particular conception of political\ncommunity or civic friendship (Ebels-Duggan 2010; Leland 2019; Leland\nand van Wietmarschen, 2017; Lister 2013). On this account, the\npractice of public reason is a constitutive part of a valuable\nrelationship. This relationship might be characterized in several\nways. The relationship might have the same structure as other\ncommunitarian relationships. In the same way relationships between\nco-nationals might be intrinsically valuable, and constituted by\nparticular social practices (e.g. shared language and cultural\ntraditions), membership in a pluralistic political community might be\nvaluable, and constituted, in part, by a practice of public reasoning\namongst citizens with regard to political rules and institutions. Only\nwhen our political community is regulated by laws that can be\njustified to each of us, despite our diverse perspectives, do we stand\nin the appropriate sort of valuable communal relationship with our\nfellow citizens (Lister 2013, ch. 5). A related, but slightly\ndifferent view, appeals to a conception of reciprocity that obtains\nwhen people are willing to propose and abide by fair principles of\ncooperation acceptable to others, provided those others are likewise\nwilling (Rawls 1996, 49\u201350). Rawls suggests that one role for\nthis criterion of reciprocity \u2018as expressed in public\nreason\u2026is to specify the nature of the political relationship\nin a constitutional democratic regime as one of civic\nfriendship\u2019 (Rawls 1996, li. Also see Leland and van\nWietmarschen, 2017). Rawls has presented public reason as part of the\nidea of democracy itself, especially the relationship in a democratic\nsociety between free and equal citizens (Rawls 1996, 213; Rawls 1999b,\n573). On this view, \u201cthe idea of public reason specifies at the\ndeepest level the basic moral and political values that are to\ndetermine a constitutional democratic government\u2019s relationship\nto its citizens and their relation to one another. In short, it\nconcerns how the political relation [of free and equal citizens] is to\nbe understood\u201d (Rawls 1999b, 574). The value of this\nrelationship might thus provide at least part of the moral basis for\npublic reason.\n\nThis potential basis for public reason is currently one of the less\nwell-developed in the literature, and thus important features of the\nview require elaboration. For example, does this view presuppose a\nparticular and controversial conception of the good life? And why\nshould we believe that the value of civic friendship has enough weight\nto ground a very particular conception of the type of reasons that can\nbe appropriately deployed in political deliberation? A full evaluation\nof this alleged basis for public reason would need to consider these\nand other issues.\n1.5 Justice\n\nOn one common view, public reason is a distinctively political idea:\nit paradigmatically applies to the laws and other political\ninstitutions of our society. One way to explain its distinctively\npolitical nature is to ground the idea of public reason in the value\nof justice (Quong 2013; Rawls 1996). On this view we begin with an\nideal of society as a fair system of social cooperation between free\nand equal citizens. As Rawls says, this ideal \u201cprovides a\npublicly recognized point of view from which all citizens can examine\nbefore one another whether their political and social institutions are\njust. It enables them to do this by citing what are publicly\nrecognized among them as valid and sufficient reasons singled out by\nthat conception itself\u2026the aim of justice as fairness, then, is\npractical: it presents itself as a conception of justice that may be\nshared by citizens as a basis of a reasoned, informed, and willing\npolitical agreement. It expresses their shared and public political\nreason\u201d (Rawls 1996, 9). Ensuring that the principles that\nregulate our shared political life can be justified to each citizen by\nreference to this common point of view\u2014showing these principles\ncan be the subject of public reason\u2014is how we can know that the\nterms that regulate our political institutions are fair, and therefore\njust. If our political principles were instead justified by appeal to\nsome reasonably contested moral, philosophical, or religious doctrine,\nthe terms of our public life would not be fair. Public reason, on this\nview, is the only way to achieve justice given certain assumptions\nabout the nature of well-ordered liberal democratic societies. This\nrationale for public reason has several advantages (Quong 2013).\nFirst, it explains the distinctively political focus of public reason.\nSecond, justice is widely agreed to be an important value, arguably\n\u201cthe first virtue of social institutions\u201d (Rawls 1999a,\n1), and thus if public reason is grounded in the value of justice,\nthis would also explain what some take to be an important feature of\npublic reason, namely, that its conclusions ought to have a certain\ndeliberative priority for citizens. Finally, the value of justice can\nbe endorsed by people from diverse religious, moral, and philosophical\nbackgrounds, and so the value of justice can provide a relatively\nuncontentious basis for public reason.\n\nBut this view of the basis of public reason also faces important\nobjections. Some will deny that political principles, even under\nconditions of reasonable pluralism or disagreement, need to be\njustifiable to each (reasonable) citizen in order to be fair or just.\nOthers will object that this account does not provide the real\nfoundation for public reason\u2014it merely shifts the focus to the\nvalue of justice. Unless we can explain the basis for giving justice\nsuch practical importance, we lack an account of the importance of\npublic reason. Others may object, more strongly, that justice cannot\nhave deliberative priority or practical importance when restricted to\nthose principles capable of being the subject of public reason. Some\nof these objections are considered in greater detail in section 7.\n2. Scope\n\nWhat is the scope of public reason? To which topics or domains of\nmoral and political life does the idea of public reason apply? On\nRawls\u2019s influential account, the idea of public reason applies\nto what he calls the constitutional essentials and matters of\nbasic justice within a liberal democratic society, \u201cbut not\nin general for all the questions for all the questions to be settled\nby the legislature within a constitutional framework\u201d (Rawls\n2001, 91). Rawls suggests that \u201ccitizens and legislators may\nproperly vote their more comprehensive views when constitutional\nessentials and matters of basic justice are not stake; they need not\njustify by public reason why they vote as they do\u201d (Rawls 1996,\n235). Constitutional essentials, for Rawls, include: the principles\nthat structure the government and political process (e.g. rules\ndetermining who may vote, and whether a system is parliamentary or\npresidential), and the basic rights and liberties of citizens (Rawls\n1996, 227). Matters of basic justice involve principles regulating the\ndistribution of important resources (e.g. income, wealth) not covered\nby the list of basic rights and liberties (Rawls 1996,\n228\u2013229).\n\nThis proposal about the scope of public reason has been subject to two\nmain challenges. First, some doubt that there is a coherent way of\ndrawing the distinction between constitutional essentials and matters\nof basic justice on the one hand, and matters of ordinary political\nlegislation on the other (Greenawalt 1994, 685\u201386). Almost\neverything the government chooses to do (or not to do) would seem to\nhave an impact, even if indirect, on the basic rights and liberties of\ncitizens, or else on the distribution of resources in society. Second,\nassuming a satisfactory answer to the first question is possible; we\ncan ask why public reason should be restricted in the way Rawls\nproposes? Why not extend public reason to all instances where citizens\nexercise political power over one another? Rawls offers no\nwell-developed answer to this question, though a number of possible\narguments can be found in his work. These arguments appeal either to\nthe special importance of the basic structure of society, or\nto the basic interests of citizens, or to the importance of\npublic reason being complete, that is, of being capable of\ngenerating at least one determinate answer to important political\nquestions. But some deny any of these arguments, or some conjunction\nof them, can in fact justify restricting the scope of public reason to\nconstitutional essentials and matters of basic justice (Quong 2011,\n273\u2013289. But see Neufeld 2022, 59\u201360; and Watson and Hartley\n2018, 62\u201387 for defenses of the narrow scope view).\n\nAn alternative view\u2014derived from the account of respect and\ncoercion discussed in sect. 1.3\u2014expands the scope of public\nreason to cover all instances where some person or group exercises\ncoercive power over another person or group (Larmore 1996, 137;\nLarmore 1999, 607\u2013608; Nagel 1991, 159). On this view, the scope\nof public reason extends to almost all state action and activity,\nsince the state\u2019s actions are backed by coercive power, but it\nwill also extend to include the non-political use of coercion by\nprivate actors. Although this account may seem more clearly defined,\nit is also vulnerable to the charge of being both over and under\ninclusive. It seems underinclusive, as mentioned in sect. 1.3, because\nsome state activities are expressive or symbolic, rather than\ncoercive, but may still seem to stand in need of public justification.\nBut it may also seem overinclusive because private individuals\nsometimes exercise coercive power over one other in contexts (e.g.\nprivate associations or the workplace) where the idea of public reason\nmay seem inappropriate.\n\nFinally, an even broader account extends the scope of public reason to\nthe whole of social morality, that is, \u201cthe set of social-moral\nrules that require or prohibit action, and so ground moral imperatives\nthat we direct to each other to engage in, or refrain from, certain\nlines of conduct\u201d (Gaus 2011, 2). On this view, the idea of\npublic reason ought to apply whenever we purport to have the standing\nto tell others how they ought to behave. Being the most ambitious\nconception of the scope of public reason, this view is naturally\nvulnerable to worries that it is too expansive, including parts of\nmorality that are in fact governed by different standards (e.g.\nreligious standards of conduct). As noted in sect. 1.1, it is also an\naccount that depends on a particular philosophical conception of\nepistemology and moral psychology.\n3. Constituency\n\nTo whom do the relevant rules or principles need to be justified?\nWhich persons, that is, are to be included in the constituency of\npublic reason? The most obvious answer is that everyone to whom the\nrules are meant to apply must be included in the constituency of\npublic reason. But this simple answer requires clarification. For\nexample, it seems that rules prohibiting murder and rape do not need\nto be justifiable to, or acceptable to everyone, including those\npersons who sincerely wish to engage in these actions and would prefer\nthat such actions be permissible. Similarly, those who hold racist and\nsexist views may not find certain rules prohibiting discrimination\njustified or acceptable, but that does not seem to bear on the\nnormative status of those rules. For this reason, among others,\nvirtually all proponents of public reason favor an idealized\naccount of the constituency of public reason. Members of the\nconstituency can be epistemically idealized, normatively idealized, or\nboth.\n\nOn Rawls\u2019s influential account, reasonable persons\nrepresent the constituency of public reason. Reasonable persons are\ndefined by their acceptance of two main ideas. First, reasonable\npersons are, when among equals, \u201cready to propose principles and\nstandards as fair terms of cooperation and to abide by them willingly,\ngiven the assurance that others will likewise do so. Those norms they\nview as reasonable for everyone to accept and therefore as justifiable\nto them; and they are ready to discuss the fair terms that others\npropose\u201d (Rawls 1996, 49). Second, reasonable persons accept\nwhat Rawls calls the burdens of judgment and \u201caccept their\nconsequences for the use of public reason in directing the legitimate\nexercise of political power in a constitutional regime\u201d (Rawls\n1996, 54). The burdens of judgment are the many \u201chazards\ninvolved in the correct (and conscientious) exercise of our powers of\nreason and judgment in the ordinary course of political life,\u201d\n(Rawls 1996, 55\u201356) which explain how reasonable and rational\npeople will permanently disagree about many matters of value and\nethics. Rawls\u2019s list of the burdens includes the following\nfacts: (a) empirical and scientific evidence is often complex and\nconflicting; (b) we may reasonably disagree about the relative weight\nof different considerations; (c) concepts are vague and subject to\nhard cases; (d) the way we assess evidence and weigh values can be\nshaped by our total life experience; (e) different normative\nconsiderations on different sides can make overall assessment\ndifficult; and (f) the number of values any social institution can\nincorporate is limited (Rawls 1996, 56\u201357). The burdens of\njudgment explain why reasonable and rational people will be\npermanently divided over matters of philosophy, religion, and other\naspects of the good life. Because reasonable persons accept these two\nideas, Rawls suggests they will also accept the idea of public\nreason\u2014the only terms of social cooperation that will seem fair\ngiven the burdens of judgment will be terms that can be justified by\nappeal to ideals or arguments that all reasonable persons can accept.\nReasonable persons will thus eschew appeals to religious ideas or\nother controversial claims over which reasonable persons are assumed\nto disagree, and instead appeal only to those public or political\nideas that are part of a liberal democratic political culture and can\nbe assumed acceptable to all persons as reasonable and rational (Rawls\n1996, 217).\n\nThis Rawlsian account of the constituency of public reason is both\nepistemically and normatively idealized. We can assume the\nconstituency of public reason includes only those persons who are\nrational and so objections to proposed rules or principles cannot fail\nthe test of public reason simply because some people have irrational\nviews or have made clearly faulty inferences. But this epistemic\nidealization is tempered by the fact that reasonable persons accept\nthe burdens of judgment; controversial claims about religion,\nmorality, or philosophy cannot be part of public reason. And there is\nalso normative idealization: the constituency includes only those who\naccept certain political values or ideals (e.g. the idea of citizens\nas free and equal, or society as a fair system of social cooperation).\nBoth idealizations have been the subject of much scrutiny and\ncriticism. Some suggest, for example, that there is no need for\nreasonable persons to accept the burdens of judgment (Lecce 2008,\n162\u2013182; McKinnon 2002, 45\u201356; Wenar 1995, 41\u201348).\nOthers have argued that Rawls\u2019s conception of the reasonable\nperson includes too much normative content (Bohman 2003; Habermas\n1995, 126\u2013129). Some further issues will be discussed in\nsections 7 and 8 below.\n\nA somewhat less idealized view of the constituency of public reason is\noffered by Gaus (2011), who suggests that we should conceptualize the\nmembers of this constituency\u2014he calls them Members of the\nPublic\u2014as moderately idealized counterparts of the real people\nto whom our moral and political rules apply. These Members of the\nPublic \u201care not so idealized that their reasoning is\ninaccessible to their real-world counterparts\u201d (Gaus 2011, 276),\nbut instead are idealized in the following sense: they hold the\nbeliefs that their real-world counterparts would be justified in\nholding after engaging in a \u201crespectable amount\u201d of good\nreasoning (Gaus 2011, 250)\u2014reasoning that starts from the\nevaluative commitments of the real-world agents they represent and\nfrom the level of Kohlbergian moral reasoning those agents are capable\nof (Gaus 2011, 277). This modest level of idealization ensures that\nthe constituency of public reason will be far more diverse than the\none envisaged by Rawls. This constituency will include members who\nadhere to different standards of rationality and have widely divergent\nsets of normative beliefs, including very divergent beliefs about\nbasic matters of justice. This conception of the constituency of\npublic reason thus purchases inclusivity, and greater approximation to\nreal people\u2019s moral judgments. But this may come with a\nsubstantial cost, since it is less clear how such a diverse\nconstituency may agree on any rules at all, let alone rules that we\ncan be confident would reflect our considered judgments about morality\nand justice (Quong 2014).\n\nOn yet a different view, the constituency of public reason should be\neven more inclusive with very few, if any, standards that need to be\nmet before one qualifies as someone to whom rules or principles must\nbe justified. For example, some suggest that everyone affected by some\nproposed norm should be a participant in the public use of reason\nregarding the validity of that norm, provided they are willing to\nengage in a respectful justificatory dialogue with others (e.g. Bohman\n2003). Support for this more inclusive conception can be provided by\nHabermas\u2019s account of discourse ethics (see sect. 1.1 above),\nsince on this account norms can only be valid when they can be the\nappropriate object of a suitable intersubjective agreement amongst all\naffected parties. The same worries about indeterminacy and normative\ncontent that apply to Gaus\u2019s moderately idealized Members of the\nPublic would appear apply with even greater force to this view.\n4. Content\n\nThe debate over the constituency of public reason has direct\nimplications regarding public reason\u2019s content. The greater the\ndegree to which the constituency of public reason is idealized, the\nmore we are restricting the content of public reason, that is, the\npool of ideas or arguments that could be reasonably endorsed by the\nmembers of the relevant constituency. And if the content of public\nreason is restricted in this way, it may be possible to determine\nwhich rules or principles are conclusively publicly justified via\nphilosophical analysis, without recourse to any actual deliberations\namongst citizens. Conversely, the less idealized our account of public\nreason\u2019s constituency, the more the content of public reason\nwill be determined by some actual process of deliberation between\nagents in the real world, or at least more realistic idealizations of\nsuch agents.\n\nOn Rawls\u2019s view, the content of public reason has two parts\n(Rawls 1996, 224). The first part consists of the principles of a\npolitical conception of justice. Although Rawls accepts that citizens\ncan and will reasonably disagree about the specific content of this\nconception, he claims that this disagreement will be limited to a\n\u201cfamily\u201d of liberal political conceptions, all of which\nshare the following features: (1) a list of basic rights, liberties,\nand opportunities; (2) an assignment of special priority to these\nrights, liberties, and opportunities, especially when compared with\npolicies aimed at the general good or perfectionist values; and (3)\nmeasures ensuring all citizens have adequate all-purpose means to make\nuse of their freedoms (Rawls 1996, 223; Rawls 1999b, 581\u2013582).\nConceptions of justice, to be political, must apply to society\u2019s\nbasic social and political institutions, must be able to be presented\nindependently of any particular view of the good life, and must be\nworked out by appeal to ideas implicit in the public political culture\nof a constitutional democracy (Rawls 1999b, 584). Thus, for Rawls,\nsome of the paradigmatic examples of the political values of justice\nand public reason would include: the idea of equal basic liberties;\nthe idea of equality of opportunity; and principles concerning a just\ndistribution of income and wealth (Rawls 1999b, 584). The second part\nof public reason, at least as presented by Rawls in Political\nLiberalism, are guidelines of inquiry which include principles of\nreasoning and rules of evidence to determine how substantive\nprinciples are to be applied, as well as important civic virtues such\nas reasonableness and civility (Rawls 1996, 224). Together, these two\ncomponents provide both the normative content and the guidelines for\ncitizens when engaged in public reason with one another about\nfundamental political matters.\n\nThose who adopt a more inclusive view of the constituency of public\nreason object that the normative content of public reason cannot be as\ndeterminate as Rawls suggests (e.g. Benhabib 2002, 108\u2013112; Gaus\n2011, 36\u201346; Habermas 1995, 126\u2013131). On Habermas\u2019s\nview, for example, the normative content of public reason is not\nsomething that is determined via philosophical analysis or argument.\nRather, philosophy provides a set of ideal rules or guidelines for the\nconduct of public reasoning. The ideal guidelines for public reasoning\nwould ensure that the discussion is inclusive, public, and free from\nany internal or external coercion, that anyone may raise a point that\nthey believe is relevant to the topic at hand, that any participant is\nallowed to challenge the rules for agenda setting, and that discussion\ncontinues until a consensus is reached (Habermas 1996, 304\u2013305).\nBut on this account, the philosopher \u201cleaves substantial\nquestions that must be answered here and now to the more or less\nenlightened engagement of participants, which does not mean that\nphilosophers may not also participate in the public debate, though in\nthe role of intellectuals, not of experts\u201d (Habermas 1995, 131).\nIn a similar vein, Gaus suggests that without making controversial\nassumptions, or else idealizing the constituency of public reason in a\nway that excludes too much of the diversity to which public reason is\nmeant to be the solution, the normative content of public reason is\nlargely indeterminate, that is, many different possible rules can be\njustified as better than anarchy, but no philosophical argument or\nanalysis can establish a determinate set of rules as being uniquely\ncapable of meeting the test of public reason (Gaus 2011, 43\u201344).\nOn his account, the content of public reason is given determinate\ncontent not by philosophical argument, nor necessarily by deliberation\namongst real citizens, but rather via a path-dependent evolutionary\nprocess, whereby stable norms evolve and are selected by virtue of\ntheir capacity to make cooperative life possible.\n\nAlthough much of the debate regarding public reason\u2019s content\nhas focused on the question of normative content, there are also\nimportant questions about the other aspect of public reason\u2019s\ncontent\u2014what Rawls describes as the guidelines of inquiry. Rawls\nsuggests that these guidelines of inquiry direct citizens to abstain\nfrom appealing to \u201ccomprehensive religious or philosophical\ndoctrines\u2014to what we as individuals or members of associations\nsee as the whole truth\u2014nor to elaborate economic theories of\ngeneral equilibrium, say, if these are in dispute\u201d. Instead he\nsuggests citizens must rely on \u201cplain truths now widely\naccepted, or available, to citizens generally,\u201d which include\nthe conclusions of science when not controversial (Rawls 1996,\n224\u2013225). One interesting issue is how testimony from scientists\nand other experts is to be incorporated into the guidelines of inquiry\n(see Donahue 2020). There is at least one other puzzling aspect\nof this proposal. As Rawls concedes, one of the things that reasonable\npeople disagree about is the nature of truth itself. There are\ncompeting philosophical theories of truth, and public reason is meant\nto abstain from appealing to particular philosophical doctrines. Rawls\nthus famously suggests that his account of political liberalism, of\nwhich the idea of public reason is a central part, \u201cdoes without\nthe concept of truth\u201d (Rawls 1996, 94). But without a concept of\ntruth, how can we make sense of what Rawls says about the guidelines\nof inquiry, in particular his claim that citizens should rely on\n\u201cplain truths now widely accepted\u201d? Some argue that Rawls\nis mistaken, and political philosophy cannot abstain from at least\nsome controversial claims about the nature of truth (Estlund 1998; Raz\n1990). Others accept that political philosophy must abstain from\ncontroversial philosophical theories of truth, but insist that public\nreason requires a \u201cpolitical\u201d (as opposed to\nphilosophical) account of the truth (Cohen 2008). This is discussed\nfurther in section 7.\n5. Structure\n\nIn order for some proposed principle or rule, X, to meet the\ntest of public reason, do the reasons or arguments that justify\nX need to be shared by all members of the constituency of\njustification, or can X meet the test of public reason by\nbeing justified to different people by appeal to different arguments?\nThis is a question about the structure of public reason, in\nparticular, about whether that structure must involve a kind of\nconsensus, or whether it can allow different people to converge on the\nsame rule or principle for entirely different reasons\n(D\u2019Agostino 1996, 30\u201331; Nagel 1987, 218\u2013219).\n\nOne possible view would require strong consensus in order for\nX to meet the test of public reason. On this account, each\nmember of the constituency of public reason would have to be justified\nin accepting X for the very same reason or set of reasons. If\nmembers of the constituency do not share the same justification for\nX, then X would not pass the test of public reason.\nHabermas might be endorsing the strong consensus view when he says\n\u201cthe consensus brought about through argument must rest on\nidentical reasons able to convince the parties in the same\nway\u201d (Habermas 1996, 339).\n\nA second view requires only weak consensus. On this view, it\nis not necessary that each person shares the very same justification\nfor accepting X, but it is necessary that each person\u2019s\njustification for accepting X should depend only on\nshared or public reasons, that is, reasons that all other\nmembers of the justificatory constituency could accept as valid\nconsiderations that provide a plausible basis for accepting\nX, even if there is disagreement among the members as to\nwhich set of shared reasons in fact provides the appropriate\njustification for endorsing X. To illustrate, Albert might\nbelieve X is justified because it follows from a commitment\nto equality of opportunity, whereas Betty might believe X is\njustified because it is a necessary means of protecting\nindividuals\u2019 rights to freedom of religion, but so long as both\nthese considerations\u2014equality of opportunity and the right to\nfreedom of religion\u2014are accepted as valid normative\nconsiderations by all members of the constituency and provide a\nplausible or reasonable basis of support for X, then\nX can meet the test of public reason despite the fact that\ndifferent members believe X to be justified for different\nreasons. The weak consensus view of public reason\u2019s structure\nseems to reflect Rawls\u2019s position, and has been explicitly\ndefended by others (Macedo 2010 (Other Internet Resources); Quong\n2011, 261\u2013273; Watson and Hartley 2018, 40\u201361).\n\nIt may be helpful to connect this view regarding the structure of\npublic reason to Rawls\u2019s discussion of the related concepts of\npublic justification and the idea of an overlapping\nconsensus. For Rawls, public justification is achieved\n\u201cwhen all the reasonable members of political society carry out\na justification of the shared political conception by embedding it in\ntheir several reasonable comprehensive views\u201d (Rawls 1996, 387).\nWhen each reasonable person has found a sufficient comprehensive or\nnon-shared justification of a political liberal conception of justice,\nthen we can say that an overlapping consensus on a political\nconception of justice exists, and as a result of this consensus, there\nis a public justification of our shared political conception of\njustice. But Rawls is clear that \u201cwhile the public justification\nof the political conception\u2026depends on reasonable comprehensive\ndoctrines, it does so only in an indirect way. That is, the express\ncontents of the doctrines have no normative role in public\njustification; citizens do not look into the content of others\u2019\ndoctrines\u2026Rather, they take into account and give some weight\nonly to the fact\u2014to the existence\u2014of the reasonable\noverlapping consensus itself\u201d (Rawls 1996, 387). For Rawls,\npublic justification thus depends on the fact that all reasonable\npersons can endorse a political conception of justice from within\ntheir non-public or comprehensive doctrines, but public reason itself\nmakes no reference to the content of those nonpublic\ndoctrines\u2014it depends only on the shared political ideas found\nwithin the political conception of justice.\n\nBy contrast, convergence accounts of public reason\u2019s\nstructure allow for the possibility that a principle or rule may meet\nthe test of public reason even in the absence of any shared or public\nreasons (Billingham 2016; Billingham 2017; Gaus 2009; Gaus 2011,\n276\u2013292; Gaus and Vallier 2009, Stout 2004, 72\u201373; Vallier\n2014; Vallier 2016). Here is an illustration of the convergence view.\nX is justified for Albert by appeal to reason Ra, but this\nreason is drawn from Albert\u2019s religious doctrine. Ra is, we can\ntemporarily assume, only normative for Albert and others who adhere to\nthis religious doctrine. For Betty, on the other hand, X can\nbe justified by appeal to Rb, a reason drawn from her different\nreligious doctrine. Suppose Albert and Betty are the only members of\nthe justificatory constituency and suppose there are no shared reasons\nthat would justify accepting X. Under these conditions, the\nconvergence account holds that X meets the test of public\nreason because Albert and Betty each have a sufficient justification\nfor X, even though the reasons supporting their convergent\njustifications are not shared. Note that proponents of the convergence\nview need not (and typically do not) deny that shared justifications\nof the sort described in the preceding paragraphs are also a\nsuccessful way for a proposed rule to meet the test of public\nreason\u2014they simply insist, contra proponents of consensus views,\nthat convergent justifications are also an acceptable structure for\npublic reason.\n\nThe convergence view appears to depend on the assumption that\njustifications and reasons can be relative to particular persons, that\nis, what constitutes a justification for Albert may not succeed as a\njustification for Betty, and vice versa. But some have argued that\nthis means the convergence view depends on a controversial\nphilosophical position that is the subject of reasonable disagreement.\nUnless this controversial view is assumed, the convergence view cannot\nassure us that Albert and Betty can each sincerely believe that the\nother is justified in accepting X. The convergence view,\naccording to this critique, thus either depends on a reasonably\ndisputed philosophical thesis, or else it fails to show that all\nparties to a convergent justification are indeed justified in\nendorsing the rule in question (Quong 2011, 261\u2013273). Other\ncritics of the convergence view argue that it has unwelcome\ninstitutional implications regarding the interpretation and\napplication of laws, and that unlike consensus approaches, it fails to\nprovide citizens with the type of mutual assurance that others are\ncommitted to the project of public reasoning about fundamental\npolitical matters (Macedo 2010, Other Internet Resources; Watson and\nHartley 2018, 58\u201360). Others argue that the convergence account faces\na dilemma: it either runs the risk of self-defeat, or else it involves\na form of moral authoritarianism to which it purports to be opposed\n(Wall 2013).\n\nFor their part, proponents of the convergence view argue that what\nmatters for public reason is that rules or laws be justified to each\nindividual person to whom the rules or laws apply. If, as proponents\nof the convergence model insist, different people can be justified in\nendorsing the same rule for entirely different reasons, then\nproponents of public reason have no principled basis to oppose\nconvergent forms of justification. Defenders of the view also insist\nthat the requirement for consensus or shared reasons is overly\ndemanding, and fails to be consistent with the pluralistic forms of\nreasoning that are possible amongst the relevant members of the\nconstituency of public reason. Part of the point of public reason, on\nthis view, is to accommodate the diverse forms of reasoning that are\nbound to exist among any reasonably competent group of reasoners (Gaus\n2011, 288\u2013292; Vallier, 2014; Vallier, 2016).\n6. Site and Duties\n\nWhat duties, if any, does the idea of public reason impose on\nindividuals? And in what domains or parts of our life do the\nrequirements of public reason apply?\n\nRawls argues that public reason imposes a moral duty of\ncivility on all citizens to explain to one another how, at least\nwith regard to constitutional essentials and matters of basic justice,\nthe political positions \u201cthey advocate and vote for can be\nsupported by the political values of public reason\u201d (Rawls 1996,\n217). Citizens, Rawls suggests, should think of themselves as if they\nwere legislators, supporting only those political positions that they\nbelieve could be justified by appeal to reasons that all reasonable\npersons could endorse, and holding government officials to this\nstandard (Rawls 1999b, 576\u2013577). But Rawls appears to believe\nthat public reason imposes greater duties on public officials: elected\nofficials and those who run for office, their staff, and judges. This\nis because, in these roles, these people work at what Rawls considers\nthe main site of public reason, namely, the public\npolitical forum. This forum has three parts: (1) the discourse of\njudges, (2) the discourse of government officials, and (3) the\ndiscourse of candidates for public office and their campaign managers\n(Rawls 1999b, 575). The public political forum is the arena where our\nfundamental political principles and institutions are shaped and\ndebated\u2014it is where collective political power is most directly\nexercised\u2014and thus it is the most appropriate site for the\napplication of individual duties of public reason. When engaged in\ndiscourse in this arena, officials are to refrain from appealing to\nreligious or other comprehensive doctrines over which reasonable\npersons are assumed to disagree, and instead make arguments that\nappeal to our shared political values. Rawls does, however, qualify\nthis duty by appeal to what he refers to as the \u201cwide\nview\u201d of public political culture, which permits officials and\ncitizens to introduce their religious or otherwise comprehensive views\ninto political discussion at any point, provided appropriate public\nreasons are provided in due course (Rawls 1999b, 591). It is also\nimportant to note that the duty of civility is, on Rawls\u2019s view,\na moral but not a legal duty\u2014it cannot be coercively\nimposed\u2014and it does not apply to the discussions citizens may\nhave outside the public political forum, for example, the discussions\nindividuals have qua members of private associations, or family\nmembers, or discussions within universities, religious institutions,\nor other parts of what Rawls calls the background culture (Rawls 1996,\n220).\n\nRawls\u2019s account of the duty of civility and the site of public\nreason has been subject to a number of criticisms, some of which will\nbe discussed in section 7 below. But even setting these objections\naside, not all proponents of public reason believe that it ought to\ndirectly regulate the behavior of individual citizens in the manner\nsuggested by Rawls. Some argue that the aims of public reason are best\nserved by permitting ordinary citizens, and perhaps even elected\nofficials, to debate and deliberate unconstrained by the duty of\ncivility (e.g. Benhabib 2002, 108\u2013112; Bohman 2003; Gaus 2009;\nGaus and Vallier 2009; Vallier 2014; Vallier 2016). Some argue for\nthis less restrictive view because they hold different conceptions of\nthe constituency and content of public reason; the more\nphilosophically indeterminate those conceptions are, the less\nplausible it is to impose a restrictive duty of civility on individual\ncitizens, since only by allowing citizens to engage in a fairly\nunconstrained discourse can the content of public reason emerge\n(Benhabib 2002; Bohman 2003). Others reject the duty of civility\nbecause they endorse a different account of the structure of public\nreason. If, for example, the convergence view of public reason\u2019s\nstructure is correct, then citizens and officials need not refrain\nfrom appealing to religious or otherwise comprehensive arguments in\npolitical deliberations, since those reasons might succeed in\njustifying a proposed law to some members of the public, even if\nothers cannot reasonably accept those reasons. Those who endorse\nconsensus conceptions of public reason\u2019s structure, however, are\nlikely to protest that abandoning the duty of civility in this way is\nto effectively abandon the idea of public reason, since there would no\nlonger be any requirement that public policies be justified by appeal\nto shared or common reasons.\n\nDifferent accounts of public reason thus yield sharply different views\nregarding the duties of citizens and public officials. On\nRawls\u2019s view, and other similar views, citizens and public\nofficials should generally refrain from relying on ideas or reasons\nthat other reasonable citizens reject, and must always show how the\npolitical positions they support can be justified by appeal to shared\npolitical values. On other accounts, the idea public reason may\nregulate the way we design our democratic institutions, and may be a\nstandard by which particular principles and laws can be assessed, but\nit imposes few, if any, moral restrictions on the behavior of citizens\nand perhaps even elected officials.\n7. Objections\n\nThis section considers some of the most prominent objections to the\nidea of public reason. The list below is not exhaustive, and some of\nthe objections below apply to some conceptions of public reason, but\nnot others.\n7.1 Idealization\n\nAs we have seen above, all conceptions of public reason involve a\ncertain amount of idealization. The persons to whom rules must be\njustified are not persons as they actually are, with all their\nprejudices, biases, and irrational beliefs. Instead, the constituency\nof public reason is typically idealized on both moral and epistemic\ndimensions. Critics of public reason sometimes object to this\nidealization (Enoch 2013; Enoch 2015; Raz 1990). The objection is best\npresented in the form of a dilemma. On the one hand, if the degree of\nidealization is kept to a minimum, then public reason may result in\nanarchy, or may fail to deliver minimally acceptable results; for\nexample, rules prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race or sex\nmay not be justifiable to only modestly idealized parties. On the\nother hand, if the degree of idealization is very substantial, this\ncreates two different worries. First, it\u2019s no longer clear in\nwhat sense the resulting rules are justifiable to the real persons\nbound by the rules. The whole apparatus of public justification might\nseem superfluous (Van Schoelandt 2015); it would be simpler and more\naccurate to simply present certain principles or reasons as true, and\ndeclare that anyone who refuses to acknowledge their truth is making\nan error. Second, and relatedly, too much idealization may implausibly\nentail that almost all real persons are excluded from the constituency\nof public reason (Enoch 2015, 122\u201323). The dilemma is nicely\nsummarized by Raz:\n\nIt seems tempting to say that our duty to act only on political\nprinciples to which the reasonable consent is simply the duty to act\non well-founded, valid principles. For that is what the reasonable\nconsent to. This eliminates the independent role of consent . . . The\npuzzle is how one can give consent a viable role, without saying that\nonly principles already agreed to by all can be relied on. One must\nfind a reasonable interpretation of the intuitively appealing idea\nthat political principles must be accessible to people as they are . .\n. Politics must take people as they come and be accessible to them,\ncapable of commanding their consent without expecting them to change\nin any radical way. But at the same time, justified political\nprinciples may be controversial, and may fail to command actual\nconsent. Nagel and Rawls offer interpretations of this intuition which\naim to be both coherent and attractive. Their failure suggests that\nthe underlying idea may at bottom be unstable and incoherent. There\nmay be no middle way between actual (including implied) agreement and\nrational justification. (Raz 1990, 46).\n\n\nIn response, several strategies are available to the proponent of\npublic reason. First, the proponent might aim for a Goldilocks\nsolutions; locate a degree of idealization that is substantial enough\nto avoid the first horn of the dilemma, without being so substantial\nas to generate the problems associated with the second horn (Vallier\n2014, 145\u2013180). Second, proponents of public reason might\nembrace either horn of the dilemma. On the one hand, they might argue\nthat accounts of public reason cannot be judged by independent moral\nstandards. We have to follow the process of public justification\nwherever it goes, even if this entails only a minimal set of rules are\npublicly justifiable. On the other hand, proponents of public reason\nmight embrace the consequences of a great deal of idealization. In\nparticular, if we bear in mind that the category of the\n\u201cunreasonable\u201d (those excluded from the constituency of\npublic reason) is a technical term with no necessary implications\nregarding moral and political rights, there may be nothing so\ncounterintuitive about declaring many persons to be unreasonable.\nFinally, proponents of public reason might resist the assumption, on\nwhich the dilemma appears to rest, that one of public reason\u2019s\ncentral aims is to mimic the normative role that actual consent can\nplay in legitimating authority. If public reason is not intended to be\nsome pale form of consent, then it\u2019s no longer an objection to\npoint out that substantial idealization might yield conclusions that\ndepart dramatically from what many real persons would accept.\n7.2 Self-Defeating\n\nThe idea of public reason tells us that, for some set of moral or\npolitical rules, the rules in question are not legitimate, or lack\nnormative authority, unless the rules in question can be justified, or\nare reasonably acceptable, to all those to whom the rules apply. Some\ncritics argue that the idea of public reason is self-defeating because\nthe idea itself cannot be justified to all those to whom the idea\napplies (Enoch 2013, 170\u201373; Mang 2017; Raz 1998, 29\u201330;\nWall 2002). Public reason, the critic points out, is a moral or\npolitical rule like any other, and so surely it ought to be subject to\nthe same test of moral and political rules which proponents of public\nreason advocate. But, the critic continues, the idea of public reason\nwill be unable to pass this test.\n\nThere are, broadly, two ways one might defend the idea of public\nreason from this objection. First, one might deny that the idea of\npublic reason does indeed apply to itself. On some formulations, the\nidea of public reason is a constraint on the exercise of political\npower, or a constraint on the exercise of coercion, but not itself an\nexercise of political power, nor an exercise of coercion. When the\nproponent of public reason states that political or moral rules must\nbe publicly justifiably to be legitimate, she does not exert power or\ncoercion over anyone, she merely states a condition that any\npurportedly legitimate exercises of power or coercion must meet to be\nlegitimate (Bajaj 2017). The success of this reply, however, may\ndepend on a controversial presumption in favor of states of affairs\nwhere political power or coercion is not exercised. It seems to\nassume, for example, that refusals to aid others, and other\nnon-coercive choices, need not meet the test of public reason.\nProponents of public reason might also argue that the principle of\npublic reason does not apply to itself because it is a\n\u201cmeta\u201d claim about the appropriate conditions for moral or\npolitical justification, and not a first order normative claim within\nthat discourse (Gaus 2011, 227\u2013228). But this line of reply is\nalso open to challenge, since the idea of public reason does sometimes\nappear to operate as a first order normative claim, for example, it\ncan be deployed to justify why one person cannot permissibly coerce\nanother, or why the latter person is justified in forcefully resisting\nthat coercion.\n\nThe second way to defend public reason from the objection is to\nconcede that the idea ought to apply to itself (Estlund 1998) and\nargue that it does so successfully. This strategy might be pursued in\nseveral ways. The proponent of public reason may point to some\nallegedly public or shared ideal\u2014moral autonomy or respect for\npersons\u2014and argue that this ideal both justifies a commitment to\npublic reason and is publicly justifiable by virtue of being a\nsuitably public or shared ideal. This strategy, however, faces two\nrelated challenges. If the ideal in question is formulated in a\nsufficiently detailed or rich way, such that a commitment to public\nreason is plausibly entailed by the ideal, then the ideal runs the\nrisk of being one that is no longer suitably public or shared. This\ndefense thus runs the risk of grounding public reason in some\nreasonably contested moral ideal or claim about philosophical truth,\nthough some argue this is the only appropriate way to defend the idea\n(Estlund 1998). On the other hand, if the alleged ideal is pitched at\na level of abstraction that ensures it does remain suitably public, it\nmay no longer be obvious that the ideal does in fact entail a\ncommitment to public reason (Wall 2002, 390\u2013391). Alternatively,\na proponent might argue that public reason can successfully meet its\nown test by appeal to a convergence form of justification. On this\nview, the idea of public reason is justifiable or acceptable to all\nthe relevant members of the constituency because each member has his\nor her own nonpublic reasons to accept the idea. For example, all\nreasonable people might converge on the importance of the value of\njustice for nonpublic reasons, and then the advocate of public reason\nneed only establish that justice, at least under conditions of\nreasonable pluralism, requires a commitment to public reason (see\nsect. 1.5 above). But this line of response may be vulnerable to the\ncharge that it can only succeed by stipulation\u2014by defining the\nrelevant members of the constituency as those who converge on the\nimportance of public reason (Mang 2017).\n7.3 Truth\n\nMany accounts of public reason, most notably Rawls\u2019s, recommend\nthat we assess moral and political rules while abstaining, in several\nways, from claims about truth. On Rawls\u2019s account, for example,\nphilosophical theories of the truth are the sort of thing over which\nreasonable people are assumed to disagree, and so an account of public\nreason cannot purport to deliver moral or political principles that\nare \u201ctrue\u201d according to some particular philosophical\nconception of truth; rather it can only deliver principles that are\n\u201creasonable\u201d (Rawls 1996, 94). Many accounts of public\nreason also tell citizens that they must refrain, when engaged in\npublic reasoning with others, from appealing to the whole\ntruth as they see it. Regardless of what you may believe is true\nabout religion or the good life, citizens must abstain from appeals to\nsuch truths, and instead appeal only to those public or political\nconsiderations that can be endorsed by other reasonable members of the\nmoral or political community.\n\nThese two ways in which public reason limits appeals to truth generate\nseveral distinct objections. First, some worry that if a system of\nmoral or political justification ignores the whole truth, the\nresulting moral or political principles may be false. For example, if\nit is true that all sinners will go to hell when they die, but we are\nprecluded from appealing to this truth in developing our political\nprinciples, we may endorse a political principle that permits people\nto engage in various sinful activities. If we could appeal to the\nwhole truth about hell, however, we would see that this political\nprinciple is false. Others worry that without some appeal to truth,\nany agreement on political principles will amount to a mere modus\nvivendi (Hampton 1989, 806\u201307). A related worry\u2014that\nprecluding the appeal to certain truths will render us unable to solve\ncertain problems\u2014is considered in section 7.3 below.\n\nSecond, we might worry that if an account of moral or political\njustification seeks to validate conclusions without contradicting\nanything that a diverse group of people believe to be true\u2014for\nexample, without contradicting anyone\u2019s reasonable religious\nviews\u2014such an account will be \u201ccommitted to the view that\nit is desirable to propagate false beliefs or unsound\ninferences\u201d (Raz 1998, 42).\n\nThird, some critics focus on Rawls\u2019s claim that the content of\npublic reason\u2014the principles of a political conception of\njustice\u2014can be presented as merely reasonable, but not true. If\nthese principles are merely reasonable, but not presented as true,\nthen why should individuals accord these principles priority in their\ndecisions about how to behave, particularly when these principles come\ninto conflict with religious or other requirements that individuals\nbelieve to be true, and not merely reasonable (Raz 1990, 23)?\n\nFourth, it might seem that public reason cannot successfully abstain\nfrom some claims about moral or political truth. In order to explain\nwhy we ought to accept a principle of public reason or public\njustification, we cannot simply say it ought to be accepted because\nthe principle itself can be publicly justified. Such a claim might be\ntrivially true\u2014its truth established by restricting the\nconstituency of public reason to those who endorse the idea of public\nreason\u2014but this does not vindicate the principle, nor does it\ndistinguish a principle of public reason from similarly\n\u201cinsular\u201d principles that appear clearly dubious, for\nexample, a principle mandating that moral principles are valid only\nwhen endorsed by Albert, who also happens to endorse this principle\ngranting him exclusive moral authority (Estlund 1998).\n\nFifth, other critics have suggested that the idea of public reason\nentails that individuals must doubt, or be skeptical about, their\nreligious or otherwise nonpublic beliefs (Barry 1995, 901\u2013914;\nMcCabe 2000, 316\u2013324; Wall 1998, 91\u201394; Wenar 1995,\n41\u201348), or at least must accept that their nonpublic beliefs can\nbe disputed by fully competent reasoners (Leland and van Wietmarschen\n2012). Some argue this is entailed by the Rawlsian appeal to the\nburdens of judgment or the fact of reasonable pluralism (see sect. 3).\nOthers claim that only if we were skeptical about the truth of our\nnonpublic beliefs would it make sense to bracket those beliefs when\ndeliberating about moral and political matters. If skepticism is\nentailed for either of these reasons, this poses two potential\nproblems. One is that this looks to be the sort of controversial\nepistemological view that Rawls and others want to avoid in\nconstructing an account of public reason. The other is that many\notherwise apparently reasonable and well-motivated people are not\nskeptical about their religious or nonpublic beliefs, but then does\nthis mean such people cannot endorse the idea of public reason? These\nworries lead some to conclude that there is no coherent way to explain\nhow reasonable persons can (a) accept something like the fact of\nreasonable pluralism, (b) believe her own non-public doctrine is true,\nand (c) be suitably motivated to endorse a principle of public reason\n(Enoch 2017).\n\nProponents of public reason have offered various responses to the\nobjections described above. First, and most generally, not all\nconceptions of public reason purport to do without the concept of\ntruth entirely, in the way that Rawls\u2019s particular account aims\nto do. Second, even those who endorse Rawls\u2019s account, or one\nsimilar to it, argue that it can meet the objections pressed against\nit. According to some, this is because it is a mistake to suppose that\na theory of public reason or political justification must also justify\nthe deliberative priority of its conclusions. On this view, it is up\nto individuals to decide whether, and why, to accord to deliberative\npriority to the conclusions of public reason. If deliberative priority\nis not something a theory of public reason should be expected to\nsupply, the third, fourth, and fifth objections above can be defused\n(Quong 2011, 221\u2013242). Third, proponents of public reason point\nout that when methods of justification require participants to refrain\nfrom appealing to the whole truth, this does not entail the\nconclusions reached will not be true, or that the method is somehow\nindifferent with regard to the truth of the conclusions reached\n(Mendus 2002, 26\u201328; Rawls 1996, 150). Certain appeals to\ntruth\u2014for example, hearsay\u2014are not permitted in a\ncourtroom, but this does not show that we are unconcerned with the\ntruth of the conclusions we reach in criminal trials. Fourth, and\nrelatedly, in contexts when we aim at truth or justification, we also\nrecognize the importance of other considerations and allow these\nconsiderations to constrain the means by which truth is pursued, for\nexample, spouses cannot be required to testify against one another\n(Freeman 2007, 233\u2013235; Rawls 1996, 218). Finally, some might\nargue, following Rawls, that we do not need to affirm any given\npolitical principle or rule as true, only as the most reasonable one\navailable in light of our commitment to certain public political\nvalues; this is sufficient to show why we ought to endorse the\nprinciple or rule in question, at least insofar as we see ourselves as\nreasonable citizens.\n7.4 Incompleteness\n\nOne of the most important objections pressed against the idea of\npublic reason concerns its capacity to provide solutions to all, or\nalmost all, of the important moral and political questions we face,\nthat is, the question of whether public reason is complete\n(Rawls 1996, 244\u2013246; Rawls 1999b, 585\u2013586). A number of\ncritics argue that public reason lacks the resources to offer\nsolutions to many important moral or political questions because the\nanswers to these questions depend on appeal to controversial moral,\nreligious, or metaphysical claims of the sort over which reasonable\npeople disagree and that are excluded from many conceptions of public\nreason, particularly those conceptions that adopt a consensus approach\nto the structure of public reason (Horton 2003: Kramer 2017, 92\u2013155;\nde Marneffe 1994; Reidy 2000: Sandel 1998).\n\nThere are two ways in which public reason might be incomplete (Gaus\n1996, 151\u2013158: Schwartzman 2004). First, public reason might be\nindeterminate, that is, it may be unable to deliver any clear\nconclusions about a particular question. In these cases, it is\nsometimes said that public reason \u201cruns out\u201d: its content\nsimply proves insufficient to yield an answer to the question posed.\nSecond, public reason might be inconclusive with regard to\nsome question, that is, a plurality of different answers might be\napparently justified by appeal to public reason, and public reason\nalone cannot clearly tell us which answer is correct or the most\nreasonable alternative.\n\nIndeterminacy is the more serious charge, but critics maintain that\neven if public reason was only inconclusive with regard to many\nquestions, this would also be a serious, perhaps fatal, objection to\npublic reason. Some of the topics with regard to which critics allege\npublic reason is either inconclusive or indeterminate include:\nabortion, stem-cell research, gay marriage, prostitution, justice for\nfuture generations, the treatment of animals, and other issues where\ncritics allege getting the right moral or political answer depends\nupon religious or metaphysical claims about personhood, or else on\ncontroversial claims about human flourishing or the good life. Some\ncritics believe that virtually all moral or political questions\ndepend, to a certain extent, on truths about personhood, metaphysics,\nor human flourishing, and so these critics are likely to see the\ncharge of incompleteness as a deep and pervasive problem for public\nreason.\n\nWhat responses are available to the proponent of public reason? With\nregard to the charge of inconclusiveness, most advocates of public\nreason are inclined to accept the charge, but deny that it represents\nan objection (Freeman 2007, 242\u2013243; Gaus 2011, 303\u2013333;\nQuong 2011, 204\u2013212, 285\u2013287; Rawls 1996, 240\u2013241;\nSchwartzman 2004; A. Williams 2000). If, for a given moral or\npolitical question, public reason seems to yield a number of equally\nreasonable answers, we should find an appropriate way to choose\nbetween these competing answers. If we do so, the idea of public\nreason is upheld, rather than undermined. On this view, the critics\nwrongly suppose that the point of public reason is to deliver a unique\nanswer to each question we face; the point is rather to ensure that\nthe rules or principles that we adopt can be reasonably justified to\nall. Showing that some rule we currently apply is not the only rule\nthat can meet the test of public reason is no objection, provided the\nmechanism by which different public justifiable rules are selected can\nitself be reasonably justified. The charge of indeterminacy seems more\nserious: if public reason can provide no answer to a given moral or\npolitical question, we are apparently left with no alternative but to\nrely on nonpublic forms of reasoning. In response to this objection,\nthere are two main strategies. One is to insist that public reason is\nunlikely to be indeterminate in many cases, or at least to rebut\nspecific attempts by critics to show that public reason is\nindeterminate with regard to a particular question (Bell 2002; Freeman\n2007, 241\u2013251; Schwartzman 2004, 205\u2013208; A. Williams\n2000, 205\u2013208). The second strategy is to insist that, even if\npublic reason is indeterminate with regard to a given question, this\ndoes not suffice to establish that it is permissible to resort to\nnonpublic forms of reasoning. Alternative solutions\u2014deferring\ndecisions if possible, finding forms of mutual accommodation, or\nrandom decision-making procedures\u2014may be preferable to resorting\nto nonpublic reasoning (Schwartzman 2004, 209\u2013214; A. Williams\n2000, 209\u2013211).\n7.5 Exclusion\n\nSome critics argue that the idea of public reason\u2014again\nparticularly Rawls\u2019s conception\u2014is in some way unfair or\nunduly exclusionary. This complaint is most often made on behalf of\nthose who would rely on religious arguments when deliberating about\nimportant moral and political questions (Eberle 2002; Greenawalt 1995;\nSmith 2010; Stout 2004; Vallier 2014; Weithman 2002), though the\nobjection is also sometimes made more generally on behalf of those who\nare excluded from the constituency of public reason on normative\ngrounds (Bohman 2003; Friedman 2000). There are many different\nversions of this objection, and the list that follows is not\nexhaustive. Put most forcefully, public reason is a sham: it purports\nto be an impartial or neutral method of moral or political\njustification, but it is, in fact, a form of sectarian secularism or\nmodern liberalism masquerading as something more inclusive. A second,\nless strident, version of this objection points out that even those\ntheories of public reason that are not explicitly secular will\nnevertheless make it more difficult, on balance, for religious\ncitizens to justify their favored views. Public reason cannot help but\ntilt in a secular direction given its requirement that principles or\nrules be reasonably justifiable to all members of the community.\nEveryone can understand and endorse a variety of secular\nconsiderations, but there is no religious idea or argument that all\nreasonable people can accept, and thus public reason has an in-built\nbias against religious doctrines and those who believe such doctrines\nare relevant to moral and political argument. A third version of the\nobjection queries why controversial religious arguments, claims about\nthe good life, or metaphysical arguments, are excluded from playing a\nrole in public reason, but controversial arguments about justice or\nindividual rights are not similarly excluded. If, as the critic\nalleges, nothing can justify this asymmetric treatment of\ncontroversial arguments from different domains of inquiry, then the\nidea of public reason is unjustifiably biased against those who rely\non religious, metaphysical, or perfectionist arguments. This objection\nis sometimes called the asymmetry objection (Brower 1994,\n21\u201322; Caney 1995, 258; Sandel 1998, 202\u2013210; Waldron\n1999, ch. 7). A variant of this objection focuses on the claim that\nreasons must be \u201caccessible\u201d in order to qualify as\npublic. The critics allege that, however the notion of accessibility\nis defined, there will be no clear grounds for declaring that many\nreligious arguments are not accessible and thus nonpublic when\ncompared to various apparently public non-religious arguments (Eberle\n2002, 255\u2013260). Fourth, some critics worry that Rawls\u2019s moral\nduty of civility (see sect. 6 above) will either discourage some\ncitizens from engaging in legitimate acts of religious expression and\nassociation, or at least will create a political atmosphere where\nreligious arguments and those who espouse them are treated as less\nvaluable when compared with purely \u201cpublic\u201d reasons and\nthose who restrict themselves to such arguments (Vallier 2014,\n59\u201364). Finally, some critics argue that public reason is not\nthe only way, and perhaps not the best way, to show respect for\nothers, or show civility, when engaged in moral and political\ndialogue. There are equally plausible conceptions of respect and\ncivility which favor presenting others with the whole truth as we see\nit when engaged in moral or political debate, rather than restricting\nourselves to shared or common reasons. If this is true, then those who\nground their moral or political arguments only in religious or\notherwise nonpublic reasons are not being unreasonable or\ndisrespectful: they are simply following a different, but equally\nplausible, interpretation of what respect or civility requires (Eberle\n2002; Pallikkathayil 2019; Stout 2004, 67\u201385; Weithman\n2002).\n\nA variety of different replies are available for the proponent of\npublic reason. In response to the first charge, defenders of public\nreason can point out that it is not only religious doctrines that are\ndeemed \u201cnonpublic\u201d by leading theories of public reason\nsuch as Rawls\u2019s. Secular doctrines such as utilitarianism or\ncontroversial secular claims about the good life are also deemed\nnonpublic. Thus it seems unfair to allege that public reason is simply\na fig leaf for a secular agenda. In response to the second objection,\ntheorists of public reason may concede that there is a sense in which\npublic reason tilts in a secular direction, but insist this is not an\narbitrary bias, but rather the justifiable result of the requirement\nthat certain principles or rules be justifiable to all those who are\nbound by them. The charge of bias thus in fact depends on a much\ndeeper objection to the public reason project, and so the critic who\npresses the charge of bias must be prepared to rebut the more\nfundamental arguments offered in favor of public reason.\n\nSeveral different responses have been offered in reply to the third\nobjection: the asymmetry objection. Some argue the objection can be\ndefused by constructing an account of public reason (or the closely\nrelated idea of a political liberalism) without appeal to what Rawls\ncalls the burdens of judgment, or other apparently epistemological\npremises (see sect. 1 above) (Lecce 2008, ch. 6). Others deny that\npublic reason should include an accessibility requirement (Vallier\n2011). Finally, others argue that it is a mistake to suppose that\nreligious arguments are excluded from public reason because they are\ncontroversial or the subject or reasonable disagreement amongst\ncitizens, since the same can be said for many non-religious arguments.\nRather, on this view, they are excluded because the disagreements or\ncontroversies over religious and other comprehensive doctrines are\ndeeper or more foundational and lack the normative common ground that\ncharacterize reasonable disagreements over matters of justice and\nindividual rights (Quong 2011, 192\u2013220).\n\nIn response to the fourth charge\u2014that an ideal of public reason\nwill directly or indirectly discourage religious expression, or create\nthe perception that those who invoke religious arguments are, in some\nsense, second class citizens\u2014the proponent of public reason can\noffer at least two replies. First, not all theories of public reason\nshare Rawls\u2019s view regarding the moral duty of civility. As we\nsaw in section 6, some accounts of public reason entail fewer, if any,\ndirect restrictions on the behavior of individual citizens. Second,\nRawls\u2019s own view does not prohibit citizens from offering\nreligious or nonpublic arguments for their favored positions; it only\nrequires that individuals who do so eventually supplement these\narguments with public reasons (again see sect. 6). Finally, proponents\nof public reason are likely to deny that there are plausible\nalternative conceptions of civility or respect that would allow\nreligious and other non-shared arguments to play a more central role\nin moral or political justification (Quong 2013), or else they may\ndeny that the grounds of public reason are in fact best explicated by\nappeal to notions of civility or respect (see sect. 1).\n7.6 Antidemocratic\n\nA further objection to the idea of public reason\u2014again\nparticularly Rawls\u2019s account\u2014is that it is antidemocratic.\nOn Rawls\u2019s account, the content of public reason is partly fixed\nvia philosophical argument, prior to any actual democratic\ndeliberation amongst citizens (see sect. 5). Seyla Benhabib thus\ncomplains that \u201cpublic reason in Rawls\u2019s theory is best\nviewed not as a process of reasoning among citizens, but more\nas a regulative principle, imposing certain standards upon how\nindividuals, institutions, and agencies ought to reason about\npublic matters. The standards of public reason are set by a\npolitical conception of liberalism\u201d (Benhabib 2002,\n108). Similarly, Habermas argues that Rawls\u2019s theory does not\ntake seriously enough the importance of democratic or political\nautonomy, and by giving public reason determinate content in the shape\nof certain liberal principles \u201cgenerates a priority of liberal\nrights which demotes the democratic process to an inferior\nstatus\u201d (Habermas 1995, 128). Although these complaints are made\nabout Rawls\u2019s account, the objection obviously applies, with\ngreater or lesser force, to any conception of public reason that fixes\nthe content of public reason, to some extent, prior to any actual\ndemocratic debate.\n\nThe response on behalf of Rawls\u2019s account and similar views is\nlikely to take the following form. First, Rawls does not purport to\noffer a determinate account of public reason\u2019s content; rather\nhe suggests that the content of public reason is given by a family of\npolitical conceptions of justice. His theory thus \u201cdoes not try\nto fix public reason once and for all in the form of one favored\npolitical conception of justice\u201d (Rawls 1999b, 582). Second,\ninsofar as the content of public reason is partly\ndeterminate\u2014for example, Rawls claims it must include certain\nbasic rights and liberties for all persons\u2014this does not appear\nparticularly objectionable, nor does it seem a problematic restriction\nof the democratic process, unless one believes that democratic\nmajorities can permissibly vote to deny the basic rights of certain\nindividuals (Quong 2013). Finally, since all conceptions of public\nreason aim at the public justification of moral or political rules, it\nis not strange to suppose that the content of public reason might be\npartly determinate prior to any actual discussion and deliberation. It\nis plausible to believe that certain basic rules prohibiting\nnon-consensual harming of innocent persons, or protecting certain\nminimal rights of bodily integrity, must be justifiable to all members\nof the constituency of public reason, provided we assume those members\nare committed to certain minimal ideals of freedom and equality (Cohen\n2010, 272\u2013277). To assume otherwise\u2014as those who press the\nantidemocratic objection appear to do\u2014would be to concede that\nwe cannot be certain, in advance of actual deliberation amongst real\npersons, that our most basic moral and political commitments are\npublicly justifiable. If this assumption were true, it seems more\nlikely to count against the very idea of public reason, as opposed to\nsomething that counts against Rawls\u2019s particular conception of\npublic reason.\n8. Further Issues\n\nThis section briefly lists some further topics that have either\nreceived relatively little attention in the literature to date, or\nhave only recently become the focus of sustained work. Again, the list\nis not exhaustive.\n8.1 Non-ideal Conditions\n\nThe idea of public reason is often presented as a normative ideal, as\nthe way our moral or political rules ought, ideally, to be\njustified, and also as the way individuals ought, ideally, to\nengage in deliberation and discussion. Rawls, for example, stipulates\nthat his account of public reason \u201cbelongs to a conception of a\nwell-ordered constitutional democratic society\u201d (Rawls 1999b,\n573), by which he means a society where: (a) everyone accepts, and\nknows that others accept, the same conception of justice (or at least\neveryone accepts some member from the family of liberal conceptions);\n(b) the basic structure of society is publicly known to satisfy this\nconception and; (c) citizens have a normally effective sense of\njustice (Rawls 1996, 35).\n\nBut what does public reason entail in non-ideal circumstances, such as\nour own, where arguably none of the three conditions listed above are\nmet (Boettcher 2012, 174\u2013175)? Some proponents of public reason\nencourage us to observe the moral duty of civility in our political\nlife, but if the duty of civility has been designed for ideal\nconditions, it is unclear whether or how it might apply under less\nthan ideal conditions (Donahue 2021; Lister 2017). For example, many\naccounts of public reason include a sincerity principle that directs\nindividuals to only support those principles or rules they sincerely\nbelieve meet the test of public reason (Gaus 1996, 139\u2013140;\nRawls 1996, 241\u2013242; Schwartzman 2011. For an alternative view\nsee Carey 2018). But does this requirement still apply in conditions\nwhere many of those with whom we are debating do not embrace the idea\nof public reason, and may behave only strategically or cynically?\nSimilarly, if we believe our existing political institutions are not\npublicly justifiable or do not meet certain minimal requirements of\njustice, do the requirements of public reason nevertheless apply to\nour political deliberations and discourse, or do those requirements\nonly apply once reasonably just institutions have been secured (Rawls\n1996, 247\u2013252)?\n8.2 Problems of Extension\n\nAs we saw in section 7.3, an important objection to the idea of public\nreason is that it will prove incomplete; that it lacks the\ntheoretical resources necessary to provide answers to many of the\nimportant moral or political questions we face. Although this\nobjection is often voiced by critics of public reason, the existing\nliterature provides relatively little in the way of detailed\ncase-by-case analysis of the plausibility of the charge (exceptions\ninclude J. Williams 2015; J. Williams 2017, Other Internet Resources;\nGreenawalt 1988). In particular, the charge of incompleteness seems\nmost plausible when we consider certain \u201cproblems of\nextension\u201d, that is, topics where it is unclear whether public\nreason can be extended to provide reasonable answers (Rawls 1996,\n244\u2013246). Some examples of these problems include: What\nprinciples should regulate our treatment of future generations? What\nprinciples should regulate our treatment of animals and nature? What\nprinciples should apply to decisions about the provision of health\ncare? For each of these questions, there is a plausible prima\nfacie case that our deliberations must be informed by\nconsiderations that go beyond the limits of public reason and appeal\nto controversial claims about the moral status of animals, or future\npersons, or particular claims about what constitutes human\nflourishing. But whether this is indeed the case with regard to these\nissues, among others, is something that awaits more sustained\nanalysis.\n8.3 Global Public Reason\n\nAnother issue that Rawls lists as a problem of extension is the topic\nof international relations. But the topic of international relations\nmay not simply be a problem of extension, that is, it may not simply\nbe a question of whether some existing account of public reason can be\nextended to provide the necessary answers to questions about\ninternational relations or global justice. There is also the further\nquestion as to whether the principles that regulate international or\nglobal justice require an independent or separate conception of global\npublic reason. The case in favor of a distinct account of global\npublic reason might appeal to at least three facts. First, if the\nfundamental ideas that form the basis of \u201cdomestic\u201d public\nreason draw on the shared public or political culture of a\nconstitutional democracy (Rawls 1999b, 584), global public reason\nappears to require a different basis, since either there is no shared\npolitical culture spanning the globe, or else that shared culture\nlooks very different to that of a constitutional democracy. Second, if\nthe relevant agents in the global or international arena are not\nprimarily individual persons, but are rather states or other\ncollective entities, then global public reason may require a very\ndifferent conception of the constituency of public reason. Third, and\nrelatedly, if we assume that a global society regulated by a\nconception of global public reason is comprised of different states,\nwhich are each internally regulated by their own domestic forms of\npublic reason, we face several questions regarding the relationship\nbetween these domestic and global principles, for example, can these\nprinciples come into conflict, and if so, how do we adjudicate such\nconflicts? Each of these assumptions, however, is open to dispute, and\nthus some might plausibly insist that there is no need for a distinct\naccount of global public reason.\n\nAlthough the topic of global justice has been the subject of much\nrecent philosophical attention, comparatively little recent work has\nfocused on the idea of a global public reason, with some notable\nexceptions (Cohen 2010, 319\u2013372; Porter 2012; Rawls 1999b,\n529\u2013564; Smith 2011; Wenar 2008; J. Williams 2017).\n8.4 Assurance, Stability, Publicity, and Trust\n\nAlthough the idea of public reason is primarily a view about the\njustification of moral or political rules, it may have other important\nsocial functions. Paul Weithman suggests that public reason also plays\nan essential role\u2014at least in Rawls\u2019s Political\nLiberalism\u2014in establishing mutual assurance with regard to\na commitment to a public conception of justice amongst citizens who\nare deeply divided about religious, moral, and philosophical matters\n(Weithman 2010, 326\u2013335). On this view, citizens need to be\nassured that others are committed to justice in order to know that\nacting from their own sense of justice is not something to regret.\nWithout this assurance, citizens might reasonably worry that acting\njustly conflicts too deeply with their narrow conception of the good,\nin which case society would not be stable and well-ordered in\nRawls\u2019s senses (see also Hadfield and Macedo 2012; Macedo 2010,\nOther Internet Resources).\n\nThe extent to which the idea of public reason does or can perform this\nsocial function depends on the answers to several further questions\n(Kogelman and Stich 2016; Lister 2017; Thrasher and Vallier 2015). For\nexample, the potential of public reason to function as a mechanism of\nmutual assurance depends on how we interpret the duties that public\nreason imposes on ordinary citizens. How can ordinary citizens provide\nsatisfactory assurance to one another that they are, in fact,\nsincerely committed to a conception of public reason? Is there an\nanswer to this latter question that also meets the criterion of\npublicity, that is one where the specific duties of public reason are\nsomething each person can know, and where the conformity of each with\nthose requirements can be common knowledge (for this construal of\npublicity, see Rawls 1999a, 48\u201349)? Some argue that while\nRawls\u2019s conception of public reason cannot serve as an effective\nassurance mechanism, convergence models of public reason can more\nsuccessfully perform this role (Kogelman and Stich 2016). Others have\nargued that a form of public justification is necessary to facilitate\nsufficient trust amongst citizens in a diverse society (Vallier\n2019).\n8.5 Gender Justice\n\nOne topic that has recently received renewed attention in the\nliterature on public reason concerns the extent to which the idea of\npublic reason is compatible with a robust commitment to political\nprinciples of gender equality and gender justice. Skeptics have long\nworried that the aspiration to justify political principles to all\nreasonable persons would constrain the pursuit of gender justice. Many\nif not most of the largest religions in the world endorse\ninegalitarian ideals regarding the roles of men and women. If the\nconstituency of public reason includes persons who endorse such\nreligious doctrines, then it might seem strongly egalitarian\nprinciples of gender justice will not be publicly justifiable (Okin\n1994; Okin 2004).\n\nA number of scholars, however, have argued that more robust principles\nof gender justice can be derived from within the framework of liberal\npublic reason (Baehr 2008; Chambers 2018, 48\u201355; Hartley and Watson\n2010; Lloyd 1998; Neufeld and Van Schoelandt 2014; Schouten 2013;\nSchouten 2017; Schouten 2019; Watson and Hartley 2018). These\narguments are developed in different ways, but they generally converge\non the thesis that shared public political values provide a sufficient\nbasis to publicly justify a range of policies designed to mitigate or\neliminate gender-based inequalities.\n8.6 Perspectival Diversity, Anti-Sectarianism, and Perfectionism\n\nA different topic that has only recently begun to receive sustained\nattention concerns perspectival diversity. Theories of public reason\nare explicitly designed to address the fact of reasonable pluralism or\ndisagreement, but the disagreement is often assumed to be only about\nnormative or ethical matters. But persons\u2019 diverse perspectives\ncan also lead to disagreement regarding how to categorize or describe\nthe world. Different parties to a dispute might all agree, for\nexample, that gratuitous harm is wrong, but disagree about whether\nhate speech constitutes harm, or disagree about whether certain\ncreatures are capable of suffering harm. Without a shared account of\nthe world, it might seem the project of public reason faces grave\ndifficulties. Even if certain moral or political rules can be publicly\njustified, our understanding and application of these rules might\nradically diverge given sufficient perspectival diversity regarding\nwhat the world looks like. Gerald Gaus and Ryan Muldoon confront this\nchallenge for theories of public reason in recent work (Gaus 2016;\nGaus 2017; Muldoon 2016). Both suggest that perspectival diversity is\nnot necessarily an obstacle to be overcome, but can also deliver\nimportant epistemic benefits. But both also suggest existing accounts\nof public reason, which often emphasize the importance of persons or\ncitizens sharing a common perspective, are ill-suited to realizing\nthese benefits.\n\nIn a closely related vein some argue that, other things being\nequal, theories of public reason that include a wider diversity of\nviewpoints in the constituency of justification are preferable to\nthose that include a narrower set of views in the justificatory\nconstituency. This idea is sometimes referred to as anti-sectarianism,\nand it has been advanced as a desideratum that speaks in favor of\nconvergence models of public reason and against at least some\nconsensus models (Gaus 2012; Vallier 2017; Vallier and\nMuldoon 2021). But for criticism of anti-sectariarianism as a\ndesideratum see (Quong 2012, 51\u201358; Tahzib 2021). \n\nThe debate over anti-sectarianism also bears on the question of\nwhether, and to what extent, theories of public reason are compatible\nwith perfectionism in political morality. Perfectionists hold that\npolitical power may legitimately be used by appeal to claims about the\nintrinsic or inherent value of certain activities of ways of life\n(Wall 2021). It has been widely assumed that perfectionism is\nincompatible with the idea of public reason since the constituency of\npersons to whom exercises of political power must be justified can be\nassumed to disagree in deep and permanent ways about matters of the\ngood life. This widespread assumption has recently been challenged,\nhowever (Kim 2016; Tahzib 2019.  Also see Chan 2000).\nThese authors suggest that the constituency of justification can and\nshould be idealized to incorporate certain ideas about the good life.\nWhether, and to what extent, this reconciliation of public reason and\nperfectionism is plausible depends in part on one\u2019s views about\nanti-sectarianism as a desideratum. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Baehr, A., 2008, \u201cPerfectionism, Feminism, and Public\nReason,\u201d <em>Law and Philosophy</em>, 27(2): 193\u2013222.", "Bajaj, S., 2017, \u201cSelf-Defeat and the Foundations of Public\nReason,\u201d <em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 174(12):\n3133\u20133151.", "Barry, B., 1995, \u201cJohn Rawls and the Search for\nStability,\u201d <em>Ethics</em>, 105(4): 874\u2013915.", "Bell, D., 2002, \u201cHow Can Political Liberals Be\nEnvironmentalists?\u201d <em>Political Studies</em>, 50(4):\n703\u2013724.", "Benhabib, S., 2002, <em>The Claims of Culture: Equality and\nDiversity in the Global Era</em>, Princeton: Princeton University\nPress.", "Billingham, P., 2016, \u201cConvergence Justifications Within\nPolitical Liberalism: A Defence,\u201d <em>Res Publica</em>, 22(2):\n135\u2013153.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2017, \u201cConvergence Liberalism and the\nProblem of Disagreement Concerning Public Justification,\u201d\n<em>Canadian Journal of Philosophy</em>, 47(4): 541\u2013564.", "Billingham, P. and A.
