    "main_text": "Key Ethical Issues in Internet Research || Privacy\n4.1 Privacy\n\nPrinciples of research ethics dictate that researchers must ensure\nthere are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and\nto maintain the confidentiality of any data collected. A violation of\nprivacy or breach of confidentiality presents a risk of serious harm\nto participants, ranging from the exposure of personal or sensitive\ninformation, the divulgence of embarrassing or illegal conduct, or the\nrelease of data otherwise protected under law.\n\nResearch ethics concerns around individual privacy is often expressed\nin terms of the level of linkability of data to individuals, and the\npotential harms from disclosure of information As Internet research\nhas grown in complexity and computational sophistication, ethics\nconcerns have focused on current and future uses of data, and the\npotential downstream harms that could occur. Protecting research\nparticipants\u2019 privacy and confidentiality is typically achieved\nthrough a combination of research tactics and practices, including\nengaging in data collection under controlled or anonymous\nenvironments, the scrubbing of data to remove personally identifiable\ninformation (PII), or the use of access restrictions and related data\nsecurity methods. And, the specificity and characteristics of the data\nwill often dictate if there are regulatory considerations, in addition\nto the methodological considerations around privacy and\nconfidentiality. For example, personally identifiable information\n(PII) typically demands the most stringent protections. The National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH), for example, defines PII as:\n\n\nany information about an individual maintained by an agency,\nincluding, but not limited to, education, financial transactions,\nmedical history, and criminal or employment history and information\nwhich can be used to distinguish or trace an individual\u2019s\nidentity, such as their name, SSN, date and place of birth,\nmother\u2019s maiden name, biometric records, etc., including any\nother personal information that is linked or linkable to an individual\n(NIH 2010).\n\n\nTypically, examples of identifying pieces of information have included\npersonal characteristics (such as date of birth, place of birth,\nmother\u2019s maiden name, gender, sexual orientation, and other\ndistinguishing features and biometrics information, such as height,\nweight, physical appearance, fingerprints, DNA and retinal scans),\nunique numbers or identifiers assigned to an individual (such as a\nname, address, phone number, social security number, driver\u2019s\nlicense number, financial account numbers), and descriptions of\nphysical location (GIS/GPS log data, electronic bracelet monitoring\ninformation).\n\nThe 2018 EU General Data Protection Regulation lays out the legal and\nregulatory requirements for data use across the EU. Mondschein &\nMonda (2018) provides a thorough discussion on the different types of\ndata that are considered in the GDPR: Personal data, such as names,\nidentification numbers, location data, and so on; Special categories\nof personal data, such as race or ethic origin, political opinions, or\nreligious beliefs; Pseudonymous data, referring to data that has been\naltered so the subject cannot be directly identified without having\nfurther information; Anonymous data, information which does not relate\nto an identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered\nanonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer\nidentifiable. They also advise researchers to consider\n\n\ndata protection issues at an early stage of a research project is of\ngreat importance specifically in the context of large-scale research\nendeavours that make use of personal data (2018: 56).\n\n\nInternet research introduces new complications to these longstanding\ndefinitions and regulatory frameworks intended to protect subject\nprivacy. For example, researchers increasingly are able to collect\ndetailed data about individuals from sources such as Facebook,\nTwitter, blogs or public email archives, and these rich data sets can\nmore easily be processed, compared, and combined with other data (and\ndatasets) available online. In numerous cases, both researchers and\nmembers of the general public have been able to re-identify\nindividuals by analyzing and comparing such datasets, using\ndata-fields as benign as one\u2019s zip code (Sweeny 2002), random\nWeb search queries (Barbaro & Zeller 2006), or movie ratings\n(Narayanan & Shmatikov 2008) as the vital key for reidentification\nof a presumed anonymous user. Prior to widespread Internet-based data\ncollection and processing, few would have considered one\u2019s movie\nratings or zipcode as personally-identifiable. Yet, these cases reveal\nthat merely stripping traditional \u201cidentifiable\u201d\ninformation such as a subject\u2019s name, address, or social\nsecurity number is no longer sufficient to ensure data remains\nanonymous (Ohm 2010), and requires the reconsideration of what is\nconsidered \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d (Schwartz\n& Solove 2011). This points to the critical distinction between\ndata that is kept confidential versus data that is truly anonymous.\nIncreasingly, data are rarely completely anonymous, as researchers\nhave routinely demonstrated they can often reidentify individuals\nhidden in \u201canonymized\u201d datasets with ease (Ohm 2010). This\nreality places new pressure on ensuring datasets are kept, at the\nleast, suitably confidential through both physical and computational\nsecurity measures. These measures may also include requirements to\nstore data in \u201cclean rooms\u201d, or in non-networked\nenvironments in an effort to control data transmission.\n\nSimilarly, new types of data often collected in Internet research\nmight also be used to identify a subject within a previously-assumed\nanonymous dataset. For example, Internet researchers might collect\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses when conducting online surveys or\nanalyzing transaction logs. An IP address is a unique identifier that\nis assigned to every device connected to the Internet; in most cases,\nindividual computers are assigned a unique IP address, while in some\ncases the address is assigned to a larger node or Internet gateway for\na collection of computers. Nearly all websites and Internet service\nproviders store activity logs that link activity with IP addresses, in\nmany cases, eventually to specific computers or users. Current U.S.\nlaw does not hold IP addresses to be personally identifiable\ninformation, while other countries and regulatory bodies do. For\nexample, the European Data Privacy Act at Article 29, holds that IP\naddresses do constitute PII. Buchanan et al. (2011), note, however,\nthat under the U.S. Civil Rights Act, for the purposes of the HIPAA\n Act,[2]\n IP addresses are considered a form of PII (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.514\n 2002).[3]\n There could potentially be a reconsideration by other federal\nregulatory agencies over IP addresses as PII, and researchers and\nboards will need to be attentive should such change occur.\n\nA similar complication emerges when we consider the meaning of\n\u201cprivate information\u201d within the context of Internet-based\nresearch. U.S. federal regulations define \u201cprivate\ninformation\u201d as:\n\n\n[A]ny information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an\nindividual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is\ntaking place, and information that has been provided for specific\npurposes by an individual and that the individual can reasonably\nexpect will not be made public (for example, a medical record) (45\nC.F.R. \u00a7 46.102(f) 2009).\n\n\nThis standard definition of \u201cprivate information\u201d has two\nkey components. First, private information is that which subjects\nreasonably expect is not normally monitored or collected. Second,\nprivate information is that which subjects reasonably expect is not\ntypically publicly available. Conversely, the definition also suggests\nthe opposite is true: if users cannot reasonably expect data\nisn\u2019t being observed or recorded, or they cannot expect data\nisn\u2019t publicly available, then the data does not rise to the\nlevel of \u201cprivate information\u201d requiring particular\nprivacy protections. Researchers and REBs have routinely worked with\nthis definition of \u201cprivate information\u201d to ensure the\nprotection of individuals\u2019 privacy.\n\nThese distinctions take on greater weight, however, when considering\nthe data environments and collection practices common with\nInternet-based research. Researchers interested in collecting or\nanalyzing online actions of subjects\u2014perhaps through the mining\nof online server logs, the use of tracking cookies, or the scraping of\nsocial media profiles and feeds\u2014could argue that subjects do not\nhave a reasonable expectation that such online activities are not\nroutinely monitored since nearly all online transactions and\ninteractions are routinely logged by websites and service providers.\nThus, online data trails might not rise to the level of \u201cprivate\ninformation\u201d. However, numerous studies have indicated that\naverage Internet users have incomplete understandings of how their\nactivities are routinely tracked, and the related privacy practices\nand policies of the sites they visit (Hoofnagle & King 2008\n [OIR];\n Milne & Culnan 2004; Tsai et al. 2006). Hudson and Bruckman\n(2005) conducted empirical research on users\u2019 expectations and\nunderstandings of privacy, finding that participants\u2019\nexpectations of privacy within public chatrooms conflicted with what\nwas actually a very public online space. Rosenberg (2010) examined the\npublic/private distinction in the realm of virtual worlds, suggesting\nresearchers must determine what kind of social norms and relations\npredominate an online space before making assumptions about the\n\u201cpublicness\u201d of information shared within. Thus, it\nremains unclear whether Internet users truly understand if and when\ntheir online activity is regularly monitored and tracked, and what\nkind of reasonable expectations truly exist. This ambiguity creates\nnew challenges for researchers and REBs when trying to apply the\ndefinition of \u201cprivate information\u201d to ensure subject\nprivacy is properly addressed (Zimmer 2010).\n\nThis complexity in addressing subject privacy in Internet research is\nfurther compounded with the rise of social networking as a place for\nthe sharing of information, and a site for research. Users\nincreasingly share more and more personal information on platforms\nlike Facebook or Twitter. For researchers, social media platforms\nprovide a rich resource for study, and much of the content is\navailable to be viewed and downloaded with minimal effort. Since much\nof the information posted to social media sites is publicly viewable,\nit thus fails to meet the standard regulatory definition of\n\u201cprivate information\u201d. Therefore, researchers attempting\nto collect and analyze social media postings might not treat the data\nas requiring any particular privacy considerations. Yet, social media\nplatforms represent a complex environment of social interaction where\nusers are often required to place friends, lovers, colleagues, and\nminor acquaintances within the same singular category of\n\u201cfriends\u201d, where privacy policies and terms of service are\nnot fully understood (Madejski et al. 2011), and where the technical\ninfrastructures fail to truly support privacy projections (Bonneau\n& Preibush 2010) and regularly change with little notice (Stone\n2009\n [OIR];\n Zimmer 2009\n [OIR]).\n As a result, it is difficult to understand with any certainty what a\nuser\u2019s intention was when posting an item onto a social media\nplatform (Acquisti & Gross 2006). The user may have intended the\npost for a private group but failed to completely understand how to\nadjust the privacy settings accordingly. Or, the information might\nhave previously been restricted to only certain friends, but a change\nin the technical platform suddenly made the data more visible to\nall.\n\nOhm (2010) warns that\n\n\nthe utility and privacy of data are linked, and so long as data is\nuseful, even in the slightest, then it is also potentially\nreidentifiable (2010: 1751).\n\n\nWith the rapid growth of Internet-based research, Ohm\u2019s concern\nbecomes even more dire. The traditional definitions and approaches to\nunderstanding the nature of privacy, anonymity, and precisely what\nkind of information deserves protection becomes strained, forcing\nresearchers and REBs to consider more nuanced theories of privacy\n(Nissenbaum 2009) and approaches to respecting and projecting subject\nprivacy (Markham 2012; Zimmer 2010).\n",
