    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n6. Metaphysics\n\nMetaphysics follows physics. It is not easy to assess\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s understanding of metaphysics. The\nvery brief treatise, The Aims of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, insists that, contrary to what most people assume,\nmetaphysics is not a theological science but rather investigates\nwhatever is common to all existing beings, such as being and unity.\nMcGinnis and Reisman provide a full English translation in their\nClassical Arabic Philosophy (2007: 78\u201381). In 1989\nMuhsin Mahdi published the Arabic text of a short treatise On One\nand Unity. It is still untranslated but Damien Janos (2017) explained its structure and contents and Philippe Vallat (2019b) studied it. Many passages of The Book of Letters are of\ngreat metaphysical import as Stephen Menn (2008) showed. These texts\nraise the question of the exact relation between logic and\nmetaphysics, as, for instance, both disciplines treat of the\ncategories (see Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-Anne Druart (2007) & Kristell Trego (2018)). Such texts\npresent an Aristotelian outlook focusing on ontology that sharply\ndistinguishes metaphysics from Kal\u00e2m and seem to leave limited\nspace for philosophical theology and Neo-Platonic descent in\nparticular.\n\nOn the other hand, both The Opinions of the People of the Perfect\nCity and The Political Regime or The Principles of\nBeings begin with a metaphysical part presented as a Neo-Platonic\ndescent followed by a second part dealing with the organization of the\ncity or state and do not treat of being and unity as the most\nuniversal notions. The hierarchical structure of the ideal state\nmirrors the hierarchical emanationist structure presented in the first\npart. Walzer edited the former with an English translation under the\ntitle The Perfect State (1985) and Fauzi M. Najjar edited the\nlatter (1964). Charles Butterworth (2015) provided the first full\nEnglish translation of The Political Regime in The\nPolitical Writings, vol. II, pp. 27\u201394. The question of how\nexactly the ontology relates to the Neo-Platonic descent or emanation\nhas not yet been fully clarified, though The Enumeration of the\nSciences addresses both aspects. Furthermore, whether the\nNeo-Platonic descent grounds the political philosophy or metaphysics\nis simply a rhetorical appeal to make\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s controversial political and\nphilosophical views palatable to religious authorities and ordinary\npeople is a hotly debated issue. Disciples of Leo Strauss and of\nMuhsin Mahdi divide al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s views into\nexoteric ones for a broad audience and esoteric ones written for an\nintellectual elite. The exoteric are more compatible with the\nreligious views and speak, for instance, of an immortality of the\nhuman soul, whereas such views are deliberately muted in esoteric\nwritings (below we will see that a lost treatise of\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee may have denied the immortality of the\nsoul). Among the most recent \u201cStraussian\u201d positions on\nthis debate one can find two papers by Charles E. Butterworth: (1)\n\u201cHow to Read Alafarabi\u201d (2013), and (2)\n\u201cAlfarabi\u2019s Goal: Political Philosophy, Not Political\nTheology\u201d (2011). Recently, Philippe Vallat (2019c) attempted to clarify what al-Farabi means by \u201cesoterism,\u201d Some other scholars such as Dimitri Gutas, S. Menn\nand Th.-A. Druart take Farabian metaphysics, including the\nNeo-Platonic descent as at the core of\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s works, even if in his\nPhilosophy of Aristotle, al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee treats\nlittle of metaphysics. We will say more on this controversy in\npresenting ethics and politics, which in the Farabian classification\nof sciences, follow metaphysics.\n ",
