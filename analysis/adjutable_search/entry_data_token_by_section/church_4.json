    "main_text": "Computability and Church\u2019s Thesis || The Internal Evidence\n1.5 The Internal Evidence\n\nMendelson challenged the view that\n CT1\n is not subject to mathematical treatment by citing cases in which an\nintuitive concept has literally been replaced by a\ncorresponding mathematically precise one. It is not a mere\nthesis that the limit concept, for example, is given by the\nfamiliar epsilon-delta definition. The definition replaces the\nintuitive concept (Mendelson 1990). Others have gone further, arguing\nthat computability may be taken as a primitive concept subject to an\naxiomatic treatment, as G\u00f6del had once suggested (according to\nChurch\u2019s letter to Kleene, 1935d [BE: 1000]). Sieg proposes an\naxiomatization based on Turing\u2019s analysis of a person who\ncomputes (\u201ca computor\u201d). In section 9 of his (1936),\nTuring argues (argument I) that the Turing machine is a good model of\na computor, who, as such, is subject to certain constraints such as\nthat\n\nthe behavior of the computor is completely determined by the\nsymbols observed and the computor\u2019s state of mind;\nthat there is a finite bound on the number of symbols observed at\nany one time;\nthat only a finite number of states of mind are involved at any\none time (a condition that G\u00f6del [1972] disputed); and\nthat each newly observed symbol is within finitely many steps of\nearlier ones.\n\n\nSieg, building on work of Gandy, formulates axioms corresponding to\nsuch conditions and claims that these constitute an axiomatization of\ncomputability (Gandy 1988; Sieg 1997).\n\nIn a recent paper (2013), Kripke argues that\n CT\n may be regarded as a \u201cspecial corollary\u201d of the\ncompleteness theorem for first order logic. Kripke\u2019s argument is\nreminiscent of one given earlier by Kreisel (1987) concerning, not CT,\nbut rather the relation between informal validity, on the one hand,\nand formal validity and provability on the other. It is useful to\nconsider Kreisel\u2019s argument first and Kripke\u2019s afterwards\n(some details of the following are not Kreisel\u2019s):\n\nLet \\(TA\\), \\(VA\\), and \\(DA\\) mean respectively that \\(A\\) is a first\norder translation of an informal argument that is intuitively valid\n\u201cin virtue of form alone\u201d, that \\(A\\) is valid according\nto the standard model theoretic definition of validity for first order\nlogic, and that \\(A\\) is derivable in a first order formal system of\ndeduction, \\(D\\), that is sound and complete in the usual sense. Then\ninformally, we have that \\(DA\\) implies \\(TA\\). If an argument is\nformally derivable, we regard it as valid in virtue of its form alone.\nAt least that is often taught to students. And also \\(TA\\) implies\n\\(VA\\)\u2014something also taught to students. By completeness,\n\\(VA\\) implies \\(DA\\). And so it follows that \\(TA\\)\u2014an informal\nnotion\u2014is equivalent to \\(DA\\), a formal notion, for the case of\nfirst order logic. (It might be assumed in addition that any\nintuitively valid argument is formalizable in a first order language,\nbut Kreisel does not assume this.)\n\nNow, Kripke summarizes his argument as follows:\n\n\nSuppose one has any valid argument whose steps can be stated in a\nfirst-order language. It is an immediate consequence of the G\u00f6del\ncompleteness theorem for first-order logic with identity that the\npremises of the argument can be formalized in any conventional formal\nsystem of first-order logic. Granted that the proof relation of such a\nsystem is recursive (computable), it immediately follows in the\nspecial case where one is computing a function (say, in the language\nof arithmetic) that the function must be recursive (Turing\ncomputable). (2013: 81)\n\n\nKripke assumes \u201cHilbert\u2019s thesis\u201d:\n\n\nnamely that the steps of any mathematical argument can be given in a\nlanguage based on first order logic (with identity)\n\n\nand he assumes that the proof relation is recursive and hence that the\nprovability relation is semirecursive. Thus, the argument runs as\nfollows: (1) Let \\(A\\) be a valid mathematical argument that is a\ncalculation, \u201cwhere one is computing a function (say, in the\nlanguage of arithmetic)\u201d. Then, (2) by Hilbert\u2019s thesis,\nthe steps of \\(A\\) can be stated in a first order language (and so the\npremises and conclusion of \\(A\\) can be stated in such a language).\nBut then (3) by the completeness theorem, there is a formal derivation\nof the conclusion of \\(A\\)\u2014the final result of the\ncalculation\u2014from its premises, and so (4) \u201cit immediately\nfollows\u201d that the function representing the calculation is\nrecursive. This is a proof of Church\u2019s thesis, assuming\nHilbert\u2019s, and, as Kripke mentions, it might therefore be viewed\nalternatively as a reduction of Church\u2019s thesis to\nHilbert\u2019s.\n\nThe similarity to Kreisel\u2019s argument is clear: Define \\(C(A)\\)\nto mean that \\(A\\) is a is correct mathematical calculation; then by\nHilbert\u2019s thesis, \\(C(A)\\) implies \\(V(A)\\) and by completeness\n\\(C(A)\\) implies \\(D(A)\\). Moreover, apart from the appeal to the\ncompleteness theorem, Kripke\u2019s argument is essentially the same\nas the Church-Kleene argument mentioned earlier and discussed in\n supplement A.1:\n\n\nIt is because of these considerations that I take myself to be\nreviving somewhat neglected arguments already given by Church, and\nespecially Turing. (Kripke 2013: 81)\n\n\nOne important consequence of Kripke\u2019s argument, in particular,\nis that as he observes, there is\u2014and has been from the\nbeginning\u2014a characterization of computable functions in terms of\nfirst order provability that is fully equivalent to the others (2013:\n82).\n",
