    "main_text": "\n\nWhy Machiavelli? That question might naturally and legitimately occur\nto anyone encountering an entry about him in an encyclopedia of\nphilosophy. Certainly, Machiavelli contributed to a large number of\nimportant discourses in Western thought\u2014political theory most\nnotably, but also history and historiography, Italian literature, the\nprinciples of warfare, and diplomacy. But Machiavelli never seems to\nhave considered himself a philosopher\u2014indeed, he often overtly\nrejected philosophical inquiry as beside the point\u2014nor do his\ncredentials suggest that he fits comfortably into standard models of\nacademic philosophy. His writings are maddeningly and notoriously\nunsystematic, inconsistent and sometimes self-contradictory. He tends\nto appeal to experience and example in the place of rigorous logical\nanalysis. Yet there are good reasons to include Machiavelli among the\ngreatest of political philosophers, some of which are internal to his\nwritings. In spite of the temptation to emphasize his political\npragmatism, a lively scholarly debate rages about the presence of a\ncoherent and original philosophy, addressed to topics of concern to\nphilosophers, at the core of his thought (Benner 2009; Zuckert 2017,\n2018; Baluch 2018; Bogiaris 2021).\n\nMoreover, succeeding thinkers who more obviously qualify as\nphilosophers of the first rank did (and still do) feel compelled to\nengage with his ideas, either to dispute them or to incorporate his\ninsights into their own teachings. Even if Machiavelli grazed at the\nfringes of philosophy, the impact of his extensive musings has been\nwidespread and lasting. The terms \u201cMachiavellian\u201d or\n\u201cMachiavellism\u201d find regular purchase among philosophers\nconcerned with a range of ethical, political, and psychological\nphenomena, regardless of whether or not Machiavelli himself invented\n\u201cMachiavellism\u201d (a term apparently coined by Pierre Bayle\nin the seventeenth century) or was in fact a\n\u201cMachiavellian\u201d in the sense commonly ascribed to him.\nMachiavelli\u2019s critique of utopian philosophical schemes (such as\nthose of Plato) challenges an entire tradition of political philosophy\nin a manner that commands attention and demands consideration and\nresponse. Finally, a new generation of so-called\n\u201cneo-Roman\u201d political theorists (such as Philip Pettit\n[1997], Quentin Skinner [1998] and Maurizio Viroli [1999 [2002]])\nfinds inspiration in Machiavelli\u2019s version of republicanism.\nThus, Machiavelli deserves a place at the table in any comprehensive\nsurvey of political philosophy.\n",
