    "main_text": "\n\n\nIn the nineteenth century, geometry, like most academic disciplines,\nwent through a period of growth verging on cataclysm. During this\nperiod, the content of geometry and its internal diversity increased\nalmost beyond recognition; the axiomatic method, vaunted since\nantiquity by the admirers of geometry, finally attained true logical\nsufficiency, and the ground was laid for replacing, in the description\nof physical phenomena, the standard geometry of Euclid by Riemann's\nwonderfully pliable system. Modern philosophers of all tendencies\n\u2014 Descartes and Hobbes, Spinoza and Locke, Hume and Kant \u2014\nhad regarded Euclidean geometry as a paradigm of epistemic certainty.\nThe sudden shrinking of Euclidean geometry to a subspecies of the vast\nfamily of mathematical theories of space shattered some illusions and\nprompted important changes in the philosophical conception of human\nknowledge. Thus, for instance, after these nineteenth-century\ndevelopments, philosophers who dream of a completely certain knowledge\nof right and wrong secured by logical inference from self-evident\nprinciples can no longer propose Euclidean geometry as an instance in\nwhich a similar goal has proved attainable. The present article\nreviews the aspects of nineteenth century geometry that are of major\ninterest for philosophy and hints in passing, at their philosophical\nsignificance.\n",
