    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nJan \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s life was that of a career academic and\nscholar, seriously disrupted by the upheavals of war in the twentieth\ncentury. Born and educated in Polish Austria, he flourished in\nPoland\u2019s Second Republic, endured the hardships of war, fled\nahead of the Red Army to Germany, and found a final haven in the\nRepublic of Ireland.\n\nJan Leopold \u0141ukasiewicz was born on 21 December 1878 in\n Lw\u00f3w[1],\n historically a Polish city, at that time the capital of Austrian\nGalicia. \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s father Pawe\u0142 was a captain in\nthe Austrian military, his mother Leopoldine, n\u00e9e Holtzer, was\ndaughter of an Austrian civil servant. Jan was their only child. The\nfamily spoke Polish. \u0141ukasiewicz attended school (classical\nGimnazjum or grammar school, emphasizing classical languages)\nfrom 1890, completing in 1897 and beginning the study of law at the\nUniversity of Lw\u00f3w. Under Austrian rule the university\npermitted instruction in Polish. In 1898 he switched to mathematics,\nstudying under J\u00f3zef Puzyna, and philosophy, studying under\nKazimierz Twardowski, who had been appointed Extraordinary (Associate)\nProfessor there in 1895, and also Wojciech Dzieduszycki. In 1902\n\u0141ukasiewicz was awarded his doctorate in philosophy under\nTwardowski with a dissertation \u201cOn induction as the inverse of\ndeduction\u201d. Having achieved only top marks in all examinations\nbetween his school leaving examinations and his dissertation, he was\nawarded the doctorate sub auspiciis Imperatoris, a rare\ndistinction, and he received a diamond ring from Emperor Franz\nJosef.\n\nFrom 1902 he was employed as a private teacher and as a clerk in the\nuniversity library. In 1904 he obtained a scholarship from the\nGalician autonomous government and went to study in Berlin then in\nLouvain. In 1906 he obtained his Habilitation with a piece on\n\u201cAnalysis and construction of the concept of cause\u201d. As a\nPrivatdozent in Philosophy, he was able to give lectures at\nthe university, becoming the first of Twardowski\u2019s students to\njoin him in doing so. His first course of lectures, delivered in\nAutumn 1906, was on the algebra of logic, as formulated by Couturat.\nIn 1908 and 1909 he obtained a stipendium which enabled him to visit\nGraz, where he made acquaintance with Alexius Meinong and his school.\nIn 1911 he was appointed Extraordinary Professor, and continued to\nteach in Lw\u00f3w until the outbreak of war in 1914. During this\ntime his students included Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz and Tadeusz\nKotarbi\u0144ski, who would later become famous philosophers in their\nown right. He also in 1912 got to know Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski,\nwho had however come to Lw\u00f3w after studying abroad and cannot\nbe counted as his pupil.\n\nIn 1915 the fortunes of war put Germany in control of Warsaw, and they\ndecided to re-open the university, which had not been allowed to\nfunction as a Polish-speaking university under Russian rule.\n\u0141ukasiewicz became professor of philosophy there. In 1916 he was\ndean of the Faculty of Arts, and in 1917 prorector of the university.\nIn 1918 he left the university, being appointed Head of the Department\nof Higher Schools in the new Polish Ministry of Education, and after\nPoland obtained full independence he became Minister of Education in\nPaderewski\u2019s Cabinet, serving from January to December 1919.\nFrom 1920 until 1939 he was, as was Le\u015bniewski, a Professor in\nthe Faculty of Natural Sciences at the University of Warsaw. In\n1922/23 and again in 1931/32 he served as rector of the university. In\n1929 he married Regina Barwi\u0144ska.\n\nThe interwar period was most fruitful for \u0141ukasiewicz. He was a\nleading figure, with Le\u015bniewski and Tarski, in what became known\nas the Warsaw School of Logic. He made a friend of the only German\nprofessor of mathematical logic, Heinrich Scholz, and was awarded an\nhonorary doctorate by the latter\u2019s University of M\u00fcnster in\n1938. Other honors awarded him in this period were Grand Commander of\nthe Order of Polonia Restituta (1923), Grand Commander of the\nHungarian Order of Merit, a monetary award from the City of Warsaw\n(1935) and memberships of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences in\nKrak\u00f3w, and the Polish Scientific Societies in Lw\u00f3w and\nWarsaw.\n\nStudents whom he supervised through their doctoral dissertations were:\nMordechaj Wajsberg, Zygmunt Kobrzy\u0144ski, Stanis\u0142aw\nJa\u015bkowski, Boles\u0142aw Soboci\u0144ski, and Jerzy\nS\u0142upecki.\n\nAt the outbreak of war in September 1939 the \u0141ukasiewiczes\u2019\nhome was bombed by the Luftwaffe: all his books, papers and\ncorrespondence were destroyed, except for one volume of his bound\noffprints. The \u0141ukasiewiczes lived in provisional accommodation\nfor academics. The German occupiers closed the university and\n\u0141ukasiewicz found employment for a meagre salary in the Warsaw\ncity archives. Additional financial support came from Scholz.\n\u0141ukasiewicz taught in the underground university. From late 1943,\nfearing the imminent arrival and occupation of Poland by the Red Army,\nand under suspicion by some colleagues of being pro-German and\nanti-Jewish, \u0141ukasiewicz expressed the wish to Scholz that he and\nhis wife should leave Poland. As a first step to their going to\nSwitzerland, Scholz managed to obtain permission for the\n\u0141ukasiewiczes to travel to M\u00fcnster. They left Warsaw on 17\nJuly 1944, just two weeks before the outbreak of the Warsaw Rising.\nFollowing the 20 July 1944 bomb plot against Hitler there was no hope\nof them obtaining permission to leave for Switzerland. They stayed in\nM\u00fcnster, enduring allied bombing, until January 1945, when they\nwere offered accommodation by J\u00fcrgen von Kempski at his farm in\nHembsen (Kreis H\u00f6xter, Westphalia), where they were liberated by\nAmerican troops on 4 April.\n\nFrom the summer of 1945 \u0141ukasiewicz taught logic at a Polish\nsecondary school set up at a former Polish POW camp in D\u00f6ssel. In\nOctober 1945 they were allowed to travel to Brussels. There\n\u0141ukasiewicz again taught logic at a provisional Polish Scientific\nInstitute. Being unwilling to return to a Poland under communist\ncontrol, \u0141ukasiewicz looked for a post elsewhere. In February\n1946 he received an offer to go to Ireland. On 4 March 1946 the\n\u0141ukasiewiczes arrived in Dublin, where they were received by the\nForeign Secretary and the Taoiseach Eamon de Valera. In autumn 1946\n\u0141ukasiewicz was appointed Professor of Mathematical Logic at the\nRoyal Irish Academy (RIA), where he gave lectures at first once and\nthen twice a week.\n\nIn his final years in Ireland \u0141ukasiewicz resumed contacts with\ncolleagues abroad, particularly Scholz, with whom he was in constant\ncorrespondence. He attended conferences in Britain, France and\nBelgium, sent papers to Poland before being expelled (with 15 other\nexiled Poles) from the Polish Academy in Krak\u00f3w, lectured on\nmathematical logic at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and on\nAristotle\u2019s syllogistic at University College Dublin. His health\ndeteriorated and he had several heart attacks: by 1953 he was no\nlonger able to lecture at the Academy. In 1955 he received an honorary\ndoctorate from Trinity College Dublin. On 13 February 1956 after an\noperation to remove gallstones he suffered a third major coronary\nthrombosis and died in hospital. He was buried in Mount Jerome\nCemetery in Dublin, \u201cfar from dear Lw\u00f3w and\nPoland\u201d, as his gravestone reads. Regina deposited most of his\nscientific papers and correspondence with the RIA. In 1963 the Academy\ntransferred their holdings to the library of the University of\nManchester, where they remain, uncatalogued. The choice of Manchester\nwas due to the presence there as a lecturer of Czes\u0142aw Lejewski,\nwho had studied with \u0141ukasiewicz in Warsaw and twice been\nexamined by the latter for doctoral theses, once in 1939, when war\nintervened, a second time in London in 1954. Lejewski had seen the\nsecond edition of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s book on Aristotle\u2019s\nsyllogistic through the press: it appeared posthumously in 1957. In\n2022 on the initiative of the Polish government his remains were\nrepatriated and reinterred with military honors in Warsaw\u2019s\nPow\u0105zki Cemetery.\n",
