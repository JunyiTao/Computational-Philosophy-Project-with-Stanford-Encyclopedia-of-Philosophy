    "main_text": "Motivations || Truth-theoretic deflationism\n1.3 Truth-theoretic deflationism\nMany proponents of\n deflationist theories of truth\n have chosen to treat truth as a primitive notion\nand to axiomatize it, often using some version of\nthe \\(T\\)-sentences as axioms. \\(T\\)-sentences are\nequivalences of the form\n\\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi\\), where \\(T\\) is the truth predicate, \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence\nand \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is a name for the\nsentence \\(\\phi\\). (More refined axioms have also been discussed by\ndeflationists.) At first glance at least, the axiomatic approach seems\nmuch less \u2018deflationary\u2019 than those more traditional\ntheories which rely on a definition of truth in terms of\ncorrespondence or the like. If truth can be explicitly defined, it can\nbe eliminated, whereas an axiomatized notion of truth may and often\ndoes come with commitments that go beyond that of the base\ntheory. \nIf truth does not have any explanatory force, as some deflationists\nclaim, the axioms for truth should not allow us to prove any new\ntheorems that do not involve the truth predicate. Accordingly, Horsten (1995), Shapiro (1998) and Ketland (1999) have suggested that\na deflationary axiomatization of truth should be at\nleast conservative. The new axioms for truth are conservative\nif they do not imply any additional sentences (free of occurrences of\nthe truth-predicate) that aren\u2019t already provable without the\ntruth axioms. Thus a non-conservative theory of truth adds new\nnon-semantic content to a theory and has genuine explanatory power,\ncontrary to many deflationist views. Certain natural theories of\ntruth, however, fail to be conservative (see Section\n3.3 below, Field 1999 and Shapiro 2002 for further\ndiscussion).\nAccording to many deflationists, truth serves merely the purpose of\nexpressing infinite conjunctions. It is plain that not all\ninfinite conjunctions can be expressed because there are uncountably\nmany (non-equivalent) infinite conjunctions over a countable\nlanguage. Since the language with an added truth predicate has only\ncountably many formulas, not every infinite conjunction can be\nexpressed by a different finite formula. The formal work on axiomatic\ntheories of truth has helped to specify exactly which infinite\nconjunctions can be expressed with a truth predicate. Feferman (1991)\nprovides a proof-theoretic analysis of a fairly strong system. (Again,\nthis will be explained in the discussion about KF\nin Section 4.4 below.)\n",
