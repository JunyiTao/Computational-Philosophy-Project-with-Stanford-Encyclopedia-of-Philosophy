    "main_text": "Conceptualizing and Measuring Access to Care || Conceptualizing and Measuring Equity of Access to Care\n2.2 Conceptualizing and Measuring Equity of Access to Care\n\nThe dominant conceptualization of equitable access to health care\namong health service researchers builds on the idea that the\nutilization of services should reflect actual needs for care (Aday and\nAnderson 1974, 1975, Aday 1975, Aday, Anderson and Fleming 1980, Aday\n2001, Aday et al. 2004). A prominent competing view, especially in the\nUnited States, is a modified market view that focuses on the\navailability in the market of a decent basic minimum of care (cf.\nEnthoven 1980). This modified market account is not to be confused\nwith a pure market view that allows all care to be determined by\nmarket forces, which might mean that some people do not even get a\ndecent basic minimum of care. However, even the modified market view\nallows for many inequalities of access to care that would be judged\ninequitable by the use-per-need view. A third model of equal,\nuniversal access can be derived from some things that have been said\nby Republicans determined to advance a model of universal access that\nrests on the \u201cchoice\u201d to buy coverage (Bump 2017). Rather\nthan taking all to have insurance coverage as the model of universal\nand equal access to care, on this model the \u201cchoice\u201d to\nbuy coverage is the key determinant of universality. It will be useful\nto examine the implications of these three prominent views of equity\nof access.\n\nConsider first the use-per-need view. On this view, use-per-need\nshould not be distorted by certain structural features of the health\nsystem, such as the distribution of providers or facilities or\nexclusionary attitudes they harbor, or by inappropriate disposing or\nenabling factors of individuals, such as their information about\nhealth care or their inability to communicate with providers, or their\nincome, or by such \u201cprocess variables\u201d as travel and\nwaiting time. The approach allows us to test whether or not a factor\npotentially affecting access, such as waiting time, actually does, for\nexample, if it produces an effect on actual utilization of the\nservices where need is held constant. Where distorting factors mean\nthat utilization of services is not determined by need, the\nuse-per-need view judges the access inequitable. In this way, the view\ncan be used analytically to test how important certain potential\naccess factors are, and it can be used normatively to make judgments\nabout equity of access.\n\nThe use-per-need approach is quite sensitive to what actual measures\nof both need and utilization are used. A process variable\u2014for\nexample, time spent in a waiting room\u2014may have a significant\neffect on measures of satisfaction with care (a subjective measure of\nactual access), but have relatively little effect on utilization rates\n(an objective measure of actual access). So the choice of objective or\nsubjective measures of realized access may yield different assessments\nof the importance of a process variable and, ultimately, of the equity\nof access to health-care services. Even if we are inclined to use an\nobjective measure, however, it matters which one. For example,\ncultural attitudes toward entering a sick role might have a greater\nimpact on disability days, as a measure of need, than they do on the\nmore serious level of need, bed-disability days.\n\nCritics of the use-per-need account argue that some process variables\nare important determinants of equity of access even if they do not\nhave a significant impact on utilization of services (Sloan and\nBentkover 1979). For example, even if waiting time does not interfere\nwith utilization, it may impose a significant burden on those seeking\ncare, and that burden may be inequitable. Another criticism of the\nuse-per-need account is the claim that uniformity in utilization rates\nis not even a necessary condition for equity of access. If some people\nare informed, yet averse to the utilization of medical services, then\ndifferences in their utilization rate from others should not count as\nan inequity of access. A further objection is that the approach\nabstracts from the effectiveness of care\u2014it does not look at\nhealth status as an outcome, only the utilization of services. People\nwith different utilization rates may have the same health status as an\noutput simply because the care was ineffective, so measuring its rate\nof utilization does not tell us what really matters.\n\nThe rationale for the use-per-need view might appeal to an argument\nfrom function of the following sort: \u201cThe (main) function of\nhealth-care services is to prevent and cure illness, i.e., to meet\nhealth-care needs. A distribution of health-care services that is not\ndetermined by the distribution of health-care needs is therefore\nunreasonable in some important sense. One sense in which it is\nunreasonable is that it would defeat the purpose of meeting health\nneeds to provide access in ways not determined by the level or kinds\nof need people have. Another sense in which it is unreasonable is that\nit ignores similarities and differences\u2014here in health\nstatus\u2014between persons which, given the function of health care,\nought to be relevant to establishing its reasonable distribution.\nIgnoring such relevant similarities and differences is what it means\nfor a distribution to be inequitable.\u201d A version of this\nargument is clearly foreshadowed in Bernard Williams\u2019 (1971: 27)\nnow classic discussion of equality in which he concluded that,\n\u201cleaving aside preventive medicine the proper ground of\ndistribution of medical care is health; this is a necessary\ntruth.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, this argument from function falls short of providing a\nbasis for the use-per-need view. The function of food processors is to\nmeet food processing needs, but no one believes that willingness to\npay for food processors is an inappropriate basis for distributing\nthem and that we must do so in proportion to the presence of\nvegetable-slicing needs in the population. The problem here is that\nmeeting some needs, but not others, matters as a concern of justice or\nequity. In the next section, we shall return to seek more persuasive\nfoundations for the use-per-need view.\n\nConsider next the modified market view, according to which we have\nequity of access to health care when a decent minimum is available to\nall in a market. Unlike the utilization rate approach, the market view\nis not really a position represented in the empirical literature on\naccess but rather a composite abstracted from views that are common in\nthe economics and health planning literature. Its interest lies in the\nquite different limits it places on the notion of equitable access and\nbecause of the quite different underlying view of health care and\ndistributive justice.\n\nI earlier noted that one objection to the utilization rate approach is\nthat similarity in intergroup use-per-need rates is not even a\nnecessary condition for equitable access (or distribution). One\nrationale for this claim is the view that health-care services are\ncommodities like any others. On this view, there is nothing so\n\u2018special\u2019 about these services that cannot be accommodated\nby allowing a market for them to respond to people\u2019s preferences\nfor them. On such a view, equity of access is assured if three main\nconditions obtain: (1) the commodity must be available at something\nlike \u201ctrue social cost;\u201d (2) individuals are capable of\nmaking rational (informed) decisions about using the system; (3)\nincome distribution must be (approximately) equitable. The second\ncondition requires that information about alternatives\u2014for\nexample, therapies or insurance schemes\u2014is available and that\npeople are competent and informed enough to make use of the\ninformation. Some access inequities arise when this condition is not\nmet and these must be addressed by public policy. (We shall see how\nthese conditions affect the philosophical arguments about prudential\ninsurance in the Section 3.)\n\nAside from the problem of subsidies to the poor to guarantee equitable\nincome distribution, the central problems of access are those brought\nabout by departures of the medical market from the ideal of a truly\ncompetitive market (Arrow 1963). In particular, there may be various\ndistortions on the supply side which amount to the market\u2019s not\ndelivering services at their \u201ctrue social cost.\u201d For\nexample, rural populations or inner city minorities may not be able to\nget the care they want and can afford. They may not be able to get it\nin the desired quantities, or at the desired times with the\ncharacteristics they desire.\n\nViewed in this way, the problem is that the market is unresponsive to\nconsumer preferences on the supply side and interventions may be\nneeded to correct the problem, generally by addressing structural\nproblems in capital expenditure policy. A central problem here is the\nway in which the choice of a health insurance plan is tied to features\nof employment and the unavailability of an adequate range of\nplans\u2014for example, ones that cover people between jobs. The\ncentral issues of access and equity of access are concerned with these\nsupply malfunctions of the market. (In Section 3, we shall see how\nDworkin (1994, 2000) attempts to avoid these market limitations.)\n\nThe third condition, about equitable income distribution, is rarely\naddressed in the literature. Obviously, if income redistribution\nbrings people only to the officially defined poverty level, it is\ninadequate to cover the costs of a decent basic minimum of care (this\nnotion is discussed further later in this section). If the transfer\nfalls short of this, we have an inequitable transfer. So the modified\nmarket view I am sketching is not that of the pure libertarian who\nmight reject all such transfers, but rather one in which there is\nimplicit acceptance of some important moral claims that might loosely\nbe characterized as \u201cwelfare rights.\u201d\n\nAssuring equitable access in the ways defined by the market approach\nleaves extensive room for all sorts of departures from equitable\naccess as defined by the use-per-need approach. Surely, there may be\nvariations in the amenities that accompany healthcare services, if\nthat is how we want to look at (some) process variables such as\nwaiting time. Equal quality in these dimensions is surely not\nrequired, any more than everyone prefers equal quality in, say,\nautomobiles. Similarly, use-per-need rates may vary with suspect\nvariables like income or race and yet not indicate any inequity of\naccess, contrary to the use-per-need formulation. Rather, the unequal\ndistribution of health care in quantity and quality can be viewed\nmerely as the expression of different preference curves, just as food\nbudgets might vary among a welfare recipient, a factory worker, and a\nwealthy industrialist. If we take the underlying income distribution\nto be morally acceptable, its expression in terms of utilization of\nhealth services need indicate no inequity.\n\nPut succinctly, then, the market approach I am considering here comes\nto this: access to health care is equitable if and only if there are\nno information barriers, financial barriers, or supply anomalies that\nprevent access to a reasonable or decent basic minimum of health-care\nservices. How plausible such an account is depends on the\ncharacterization of such a decent minimum and the moral arguments\nmaintaining that provision of such a minimum is all that justice or\nequity demands. The problem facing the \u2018market\u2019 proponent\nthus appears to be the other side of the coin from the problem facing\nthe use-per-need account. If the market view suggests we owe each\nother on grounds of justice only a decent minimum, the use-per-need\nview suggests we owe much more\u2014both require clear rationales.\nOne central problem with that account was its simplifying assumption\nthat health care is relatively homogeneous in function and that the\nproper basis for its distribution must be the realization of that\nfunction. A related problem for that account is its working assumption\nthat access can be equitable only if services of all kinds that happen\nto be offered in the system are distributed according to need. If,\nhowever, we want to treat health-care services as non-homogeneous in\nfunction, and we are willing to ground equity claims only by reference\nto some features of some of those services, we owe an account of how\nto draw the lines.\n\nThere are three ways to elucidate the notion of a decent basic\nminimum: (1) the provision of a general criterion by reference to\nwhich we can tell if services are within the minimum or are above it;\n(2) the simple listing the types of services included; or (3) the\ndescription of a fair procedure for determining the minimum. In the\nmarket literature\u2014indeed in much of the literature\u2014there\nis little attempt to give a general criterion or describe an\nappropriate, fair procedure. What attempts we get are far too vague.\nCharles Fried, in an early effort at characterization (1976:32),\nsuggests that the \u201cdecent minimum should reflect some conception\nof what constitutes tolerable life prospects in general. It should\nspeak quite strongly to things like maternal and child health which\nset the terms under which individuals will compete and develop.\u201d\nThe characterization is not developed enough to tell when prospects\nare tolerable and for whom.\n\nEfforts to specify a decent basic minimum more commonly appeal to a\nlist of categories of services or to some \u201caverage\u201d level\nof services in a particular health system. Neither of these approaches\nprovides a criterion that clarifies why these services are viewed as\ndecent and basic. Where there is appeal to a list, as in an early\nproposal by Enthoven (1980), the Consumer Choice Health Plan that\nsignificantly influenced the Clinton Administration efforts at health\nreform, it may derive from an earlier effort at regulation, such as\nthe 1973 HMO Act. It is typical of such appeals to lists that there is\nno rationale offered for why items are on the list. If mental health\nservices are included, we are often not told which ones; and there may\nbe categorical omissions, such as dental care, without\nexplanation.\n\nAppeals to an \u201caverage\u201d insurance package similarly\nprovide no clear basis for deciding whether a set of benefits is truly\nappropriate to a decent minimum. For one thing, the average may\nreflect many features of a market that is not working well, capturing\nmuch that is wasteful, ineffective, or inappropriate in a system\nproviding care. It may also be the case that an average package omits\nsome crucial features of care, for example, certain mental health\nservices. Indeed, by focusing on services provided within a given\nsystem to \u201caverage\u201d users, the concept of what we owe\npeople, that is, what counts as equitable treatment, is turned into a\ncompletely \u201cinterstitial\u201d notion. We are told,\n\u201cwithin the confines of this system, equity requires making this\npackage available, since it happens to be available on average\u201d\nbut we are not in a more general way told that the system provides\npeople with what they should get, as a matter of justice. We are, in\neffect, told that a system that aims to meet certain needs should\ntreat people equitably in addressing those needs, but we are not told\nthat a system that is fair to people should perforce meet certain\nhealth needs. Nor are we given a process that might help us decide\nwhat to provide as a matter of justice where there may be disagreement\nabout equitable coverage. In short, neither lists nor averages\nsubstitute for an appeal to a defensible rationale or to a fair\nprocess for determining what should be covered. (We shall consider in\nSection 3 how the insurance approaches of Dworkin (1994) and Gibbard\n(1982) address these issues, since each approach is part of an\nargument to justify the appeal to equal access; the choice model takes\nequal access for granted and does not make an attempt to justify it,\nand so we do not discuss it in Section 3.)\n\nConsider now the third model of what we should count as equal access,\nwhich we refer to as the choice model. Actually, this model is couched\nas a version of universal access (as opposed to universal coverage),\nand we shall have to infer the notion of equality. So what is its\ncommitment to equality of access? The foundational intuition behind it\ncan be found in Paul Ryan\u2019s words that no one should be forced\nto do what they don\u2019t want to do. If the intuition focuses on\nwhat anyone wants to do, then there is a concern about equality after\nall. It cannot be an intuition that focuses only on what some people\nwant to do if they are rich enough to have certain choices. It rules\nout choice that is forced on individuals by their being unable to\nafford to do what they prefer to do. Such a forced choice was typical\nof what people faced on the individual insurance market before the ACA\nif they bought skimpy but affordable health insurance (e. g., high\ndeductible plans that are cheaper because they do not cover certain\nneeded services). For a choice to buy or not buy insurance coverage to\nbe a real choice on this view, both choices have to be ones people\ncould select, if they wanted to. This feature rules out a choice\nbetween a health care insurance scheme people cannot afford vs one\nthat they can afford. Subsidies must be available to those with\nlimited resources that make their choices real. This requirement makes\nthe model more expensive to implement than the Republican plans\nallowed. Real choice has costs given the income inequality that\nprevails in the U.S. The costs have a compensation that has a bearing\non \u201cequality,\u201d for everyone is equal in the choices that\nare possible for purchasing insurance, and individuals have more room\nto express other priorities than the purchase of health care. \n\nThe real choices of some people to forego coverage actually make\nthings worse for those who need insurance and prefer to buy it, and\nthey create the need to fund subsidies for the foregone insurance\npurchase. We shall call \u201cfree riders\u201d those who\u2014for\nwhatever reason\u2014do not share in the cost of the health system\nbut can share its benefits (needed health care) when ill. Suppose\nfurther that free riders can share the benefits of the health system\nby meeting some modest penalty for remaining uninsured. In short, free\nriders can pocket the cost of insurance minus the penalty, but still\nget care when they need it. Put another way, the health system must be\nready to treat all people, free riders or not, because that is the\nchoice of society. (We are assuming that few people would allow Free\nRiders to die in the streets, which would happen if they are not\nallowed to get care when they need it and have not purchased health\ncare insurance.) Free riders thus get a good bargain\u2014some might say\nan incentive to free load\u2014if they are given needed care when\nthey join a system they did not contribute to, except for facing a\nmodest punishment for not joining earlier.\n\nFree riders raise the costs of keeping the system ready for them, a\ncost that is paid by all who contribute to it by obtaining coverage in\nit. So the \u201creal choice\u201d of those who forego coverage (and\nbecome free riders) harms those who \u201cchoose\u201d to pay for\ncoverage each year. These harms to others are encouraged whenever such\na choice is allowed. The replacement plans for the ACA in promoting\nsuch choices are premised on allowing these harms to third parties.\nThe price of encouraging some people to forego coverage is to\nencourage free riding and the resulting harms to third parties.\n\nTo conclude this section, we shall briefly consider what each of these\nthree approaches to access has to say about some race inequalities in\nhealth and health care that are found in the U.S. A first point to\nnote is that these accounts of access to health care do not inform us\nabout the origins of some important inequalities in health. For\nexample, certain health conditions, such as high blood pressure,\ndiabetes, and asthma are more prevalent among African Americans than\namong other racial groups in the U.S. However the differences are best\nexplained\u2014by income differences, educational differences,\nlifestyle choices, some other environmental exposure to risks, or\nbiological differences in the susceptibility to those\nillnesses\u2014if the difference is not the result of differences in\naccess to preventive services or treatments, then inequity in access\nto care is not the source of the health difference. A higher\nprevalence rate\u2014or need\u2014should lead to a higher\nutilization rate for relevant services, or else the use-per-need rates\nwould differ between African Americans and other groups. What the\nuse-per-need approach counsels us to do is to consider whether\ndifferences in the use-per-need rate are best accounted for by certain\nstructural features of the system (e.g. inadequate supplies of\nproviders in the areas where the population in need resides,\norganization of care that induces discontinuity of care,\ndiscriminatory attitudes of providers, including conscious or\nunconscious stereotyping), or by enabling or disposing features of the\nindividuals (income differences, insurance level differences,\neducational differences, age differences, attitudes toward disease and\ntreatment). If factors other than differences in need affect the\nuse-per-need rate, then we have strong grounds for thinking there is\nan unfair inequality in access to care.\n\nHow would the modified market view judge such differences? Differences\nacross types of insurance coverage (above the decent basic minimum\nlevel) that the use-per-need view would judge problematic might be\ndismissed as preference differences by the modified market view. Just\nas the household preferences and budget for food or clothing might\ndiffer across income and education levels, so too utilization of\nhealth services might differ\u2014above the decent\nminimum\u2014without the raised eyebrows evoked by unfair\ninequalities. If there is a quality difference\u2014which might even\ntake the form of additional protection against health risk through\nbetter diagnosis or more continuous care\u2014that might not be\nproblematic for the modified market view when it would be for the\nuse-per-need view.\n\nOn the third view that subsidizes all choices to buy insurance, the\nhigher prevalence of illness among some minorities in the U.S. would\npresumably lead them to make fewer choices to forego coverage and thus\nto purchase needed coverage more. That result might be explained, as\nit was on the market view, as a difference in preferences across\ngroups. In any case, it would not lead to the claim of unfairness. The\nopposition from the choice view is to the full range of subsidies that\nmake real choice possible. \n",
