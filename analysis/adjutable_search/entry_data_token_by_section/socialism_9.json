Socialist Transformation (Dimension DIII)\n\nWe turn now to the last dimension of socialism (DIII), which concerns\nthe transformation of capitalist societies into socialist ones. The\ndiscussion on this dimension is difficult in at least two respects\nwhich call for philosophical exploration (Gilabert 2017a:\n113\u201323, 2015: 216\u201320). The first issue concerns\nfeasibility. The question is whether socialist systems are accessible\nfrom where we are now\u2014whether there is a path from here to\nthere. But what does feasibility mean here? It cannot just mean\nlogical or physical possibility, as these would rule out very few\nsocial systems. The relevant feasibility parameters seem instead to\ninvolve matters of technical development, economic organization,\npolitical mobilization, and moral culture. (For some discussion on\nthese parameters see Wright 2010: ch. 8; Chibber 2017.) But such\nparameters are comparatively \u201csoft\u201d, in that they indicate\nprobability prospects rather than pose strict limits of possibility,\nand can be significantly changed over time. When something is not\nfeasible to do right now, we could have dynamic duties to make it\nfeasible to do later by developing our relevant capacities in the\nmeantime. The feasibility judgments must then be scalar rather than\nbinary and allow for diachronic variation. These features make them\nsomewhat murky, and not straightforwardly amenable to the hard-edged\nuse of impossibility claims to debunk normative requirements (via\ncontraposition on the principle that ought implies can).\n\nA second difficulty concerns the articulation of all things considered\nappropriate strategies that combine feasibility considerations with\nthe normative desiderata provided by socialist principles. The\nquestion here is: what is the most reasonable path of transformation\nto pursue for socialists given their understanding of the principles\nanimating their political project, viewed against the background of\nwhat seems more or less feasible to achieve at different moments, and\nwithin different historical contexts? Complex judgments have to be\nformed about the precise social systems at which it would be right to\naim at different stages of the sequence of transformation, and about\nthe specific modes of political action to deploy in such processes.\nThese judgments would combine feasibility and desirability to assess\nshort-term and long-term goals, their intrinsic costs and benefits,\nand the promise of the former to enhance the achievement of the\nlatter. The difficulty of forming such judgments is compounded by the\nuncertainty about the prospects of large societal changes (but also\nabout the long-term consequences of settling for the status quo).\n\nMarx (1875 [1978b]) himself seemed to address some of these issues in\nhis short text \u201cThe Critique of the Gotha Program\u201d of\n1875. Marx here envisioned the process of socialist transformation as\nincluding two phases. The final phase would fully implement the\nAbilities / Needs Principle. But he did not take that\nscenario to be immediately accessible. An intermediate step should be\npursued, in which the economy would be ruled by a Contribution\nPrinciple requiring that (after some provisions are put aside to\nfulfill basic needs regarding health care, education, and support for\nthose unable to work) people gain access to consumption goods in\nproportion to how much they contribute. This lower phase of socialist\ntransformation would be reasonable because it would enhance the\nprospects of transitioning away from capitalism and of generating the\nconditions for the full realization of socialism. The implementation\nof the Contribution Principle would fulfill the promise systematically\nbroken by capitalism that people would benefit according to their\nlabor input (as in capitalism capitalists get much more, and workers\nmuch less, than they give). It would also incentivize people to\nincrease production to the level necessary for the introduction of\nsocialism proper. Once such level of development is in place, the\nsocial ethos could move away from the mantra of the \u201cexchange of\nequivalents\u201d and instead adopt a different outlook in which\npeople produce according to their diverse abilities, and consume\naccording to their diverse needs. This sequential picture of\ntransformation features diachronic judgments about changes in\nfeasibility parameters (such as the expansion of technical capacity\nand a change in patterns of motivation). Marx also envisioned\npolitical dimensions of this process, including a \u201cdictatorship\nof the proletariat\u201d (which would not, as some popular\ninterpretations hold, involve violation of civil and political rights,\nbut a change in the political constitution and majoritarian policies\nthat secure the elimination of capitalist property rights (Elster\n1985: 447\u20139)). In time, the state (understood as an apparatus of\nclass rule rather than, more generally, as an administrative device)\nwould \u201cwither away\u201d.\n\nHistory has not moved smoothly in the direction many socialists\npredicted. It has not been obvious that the following steps in the\nexpected pattern materialized or are likely to do so: capitalism\ngenerating a large, destitute, and homogeneous working class; this\nclass responding to some of the cyclical crises capitalism is prone to\nby creating a coherent and powerful political movement; this movement\ngaining control of government and resolutely and successfully\nimplementing a socialist economic system (G.A. Cohen 2000b: ch.6;\nLaclau and Mouffe 1985). Given the fact that this process did not\nmaterialize, and seems unlikely to do so, it turns out that it would\nbe both self-defeating and irresponsible to fail to address difficult\nquestions about the relative feasibility and moral desirability of\ndifferent strategies of potential socialist transformation. For\nexample, if the process of transformation involves two or more stages\n(be they the two mentioned above, or some sequence going, say, from\nthe welfare state to shareholder or coupon market socialism and then\nto the Carensian model), it might be asked who is to evaluate and\ndecide upon what is to be done at each stage of the process, on what\ngrounds can it be expected that earlier stages will enhance the\nlikelihood of the success of later stages rather than undermine them\n(e.g., by enshrining institutions or values that will make it hard to\nmove further along the path), what transitional costs can be accepted\nin earlier stages, and whether the costs expected are outweighed by\nthe desirability and the increased probability of attaining the later\nstages. Such questions do not want for difficulty.\n\nAddressing questions such as these dilemmas of transitional strategy,\nsocialists have envisaged different approaches to social and political\ntransformation. Four significant examples (extensively discussed in\nWright 2010: Part III, 2015b, 2016\u2014which we follow here) are\narticulated by considering two dimensions of analysis regarding (a)\nthe primary goal of the strategy (either (i) transcending the\nstructures of capitalism, or (ii) neutralizing the worst harms of it)\nand (b) the primary target of the strategy (either (i) the state and\nother institutions at the macro-level of the system, or (ii) the\neconomic activities of individuals, organizations, and\ncommunities).\n\nThe first strategy, smashing capitalism, picks out the\ncombination of possibilities (a.i) and (b.i). A political organization\n(e.g., a revolutionary party) takes advantage of some of the crises\ngenerated by capitalism to seize state power, proceeding to use that\npower to counter opposition to the revolution and to build a socialist\nsociety. This is the strategy favored by revolutionary socialists and\nmany Marxists, and pursued in the twentieth century in countries such\nas Russia and China. If we look at the historical evidence, we see\nthat although this strategy succeeded in some cases in transitioning\nout of previously existing capitalist or proto-capitalist economic\nsystems, it failed in terms of building socialism. It led instead to a\nform of authoritarian statism. There is debate about the causes of\nthese failures. Some factors may have been the economically backward\nand politically hostile circumstances in which the strategy was\nimplemented, the leaders\u2019 deficits (in terms of their tactics or\nmotives), and the hierarchical frameworks used to suppress opposition\nafter the revolution which remained in place for the long-term to\nsubvert revolutionaries\u2019 aims. Large system changes normally\nhave to face a \u201ctransitional trough\u201d after their onset, in\nwhich the material interests of many people are temporarily set back\n(Przeworski 1985). A political dilemma arises, in that, if liberal\ndemocratic politics is retained (with a free press, liberty of\nassociation, and multiparty elections) the revolutionaries may be\nunseated due to citizens\u2019 political response to the\n\u201cvalley of transition\u201d, while if liberal democratic\npolitics are supplanted, then authoritarian statism may be the\nconsequence, eradicating the possibility of a socialist outcome to\nwhich it would be worthwhile to seek to transition.\n\nA second strategy, picking out the combination of possibilities (a.ii)\nand (b.i), has been taming capitalism. It mobilizes the\npopulation (sometimes in sharp political struggles) to elect\ngovernments and implement policies that respond to the worst harms\ngenerated by capitalism, with the aim of neutralizing them. New\npolicies include social insurance responding to risks faced by the\npopulation (e.g., illness and unemployment), tax funded, state\nprovision of public goods which markets tend to fail to provide (e.g.,\neducation, public transportation, research and development, etc.), and\nregulation of negative externalities produced in markets (e.g.,\nregarding pollution, product and workplace hazards, predatory market\nbehavior, etc.). The strategy, implemented by social-democratic\nparties, worked quite well during the three decades of the\n\u201cGolden Age\u201d or Trente Glorieuses following World\nWar II. However, progress was halted and partly rolled back since the\nretreat of social democracy and the introduction of neoliberalism in\nthe 1980s. Possible explanatory factors are the financialization of\ncapitalism, and the effects of globalization, as discussed above in\n section 4.3.\n There is a debate as to whether capitalism is really tamable\u2014it\nmay be that the Golden Age was only a historical anomaly, borne out of\na very particular set of political and economic circumstances.\n\nThe third strategy, escaping capitalism, picks out the\ncombination of possibilities (a.ii) and (b.ii). Capitalism might be\ntoo strong to destroy. But people could avoid its worst harms by\ninsulating themselves from its dynamics. They could focus on family\nand friendships, become self-subsistence farmers, create intentional\ncommunities, and explore modes of life involving \u201cvoluntary\nsimplicity\u201d. However, this strategy seems available mostly to\nrelatively well-off people who can fund their escape with wealth they\nhave amassed or received from capitalist activities. The working poor\nmay not be so lucky.\n\nThe final strategy, eroding capitalism, picks out the\ncombination of (a.i) and (b.ii). Economic systems are here seen as\nhybrids. People can introduce new, socialist forms of collective\nactivity (such as worker cooperatives) and progressively expand them,\neventually turning them from marginal to dominant. Recently this kind\nof strategy of the erosion of capitalism through institutional\ntransformation rather than piecemeal changes within existing economic\nstructures, has been referred to as \u201cthe institutional\nturn\u201d in leftist political economy (see Guinan and O\u2019Neill 2018). Wright (2015b, 2016) suggests the analogy of a lake ecosystem, with the introduction\nof a new species of fish that at first thrives in one location, and\nthen spreads out, eventually becoming a dominant species.\nHistorically, the transformation from feudalism to capitalism in some\nparts of Europe has come about in this way, with pockets of\ncommercial, financial, and manufacturing activity taking place in\ncities and expanding over time. Some anarchists seem to hold a version\nof this strategy today. It offers hope for change even when the state\nseems uncongenial, and likely to remain so. But critics find it\nfar-fetched, as it seems unlikely to go sufficiently far given the\nenormous economic and political power of large capitalist corporations\nand the tendency of the state to repress serious threats to its rules.\nTo go further, the power of the state has to be at least partially\nrecruited. The fourth strategy then, according to Wright, is only\nplausible when combined with the second.\n\nAs discussed by Wright, this combined strategy would have two elements\n(we could see Corneo\u2019s proposal discussed in\n section 4.3\n as another version of this approach). First, it would address some\nimportant, problematic junctures to expand state action in ways that\neven capitalists would have to accept. And second, the solutions to\nthe crises introduced by state action would be selected in such a way\nthat they would enhance long-term prospects for socialist change. One\ncritical juncture is global warming, and the social and political\nproblems of the Anthropocene era (L\u00f6wy 2005; Purdy 2015; Wark\n2016). Responding to its effects would require massive generation of\nstate-provided public goods, which could remove neoliberal\ncompunctions about state activism. A second critical juncture concerns\nthe large levels of long-term unemployment, precariousness, and\nmarginalization generated by new trends in automation and information\ntechnology. This involves threats to social peace, and insufficient\ndemand for the products corporations need to sell on the consumption\nmarket. Such threats could be averted by introducing an unconditional\nbasic income policy (Van Parijs and Vanderborght 2017), or by the\nsignificant expansion of public services, or by some other mechanism\nthat secures for everybody a minimally dignified economic condition\nindependent of their position within the labor market. Now, these\nstate policies could foster the growth of social power and the\nprospects for socialist change in the future. Workers would have more\npower in the labor market when they came to be less reliant upon it.\nThey could also be more successful in forming cooperatives. The social\neconomy sector could flourish under such conditions. People could also\ndevote more time to political activism. Together, these trends from\nbelow, combined with state activism from above, could expand knowledge\nabout the workability of egalitarian, democratic, and solidaristic\nforms of economic activity, and strengthen the motivation to extend\ntheir scope. Although some critics find this strategy na\u00efve\n(Riley 2016), proponents think that something like it must be tried if\nthe aim is democratic socialism rather than authoritarian statism.\n(For specific worries about the political feasibility of a robust\nuniversal basic income policy as a precursor to rather than as a\nresult of socialism, see Gourevitch and Stanczyk 2018).\n\nOther significant issues regarding dimension DIII of socialism are the\nidentification of appropriate political agents of change and their\nprospects of success in the context of contemporary globalization. On\nthe first point, socialists increasingly explore the significance not\nonly of workers\u2019 movements, but also their intersection with the\nefforts of activists focused on overcoming gender- and race-based\noppression (Davis 1981; Albert 2017). Some argue that the primary\naddressee of socialist politics should not be any specific class or\nmovement, but the more inclusive, and politically equal group of\ncitizens of a democratic community. For example, Honneth (2015 [2017:\nch. IV]), following in part John Dewey and Juergen Habermas, argues\nthat the primary addressee and agent of change for socialism should be\nthe citizens assembled in the democratic public sphere. Although\nnormatively appealing, this proposal may face serious feasibility\ndifficulties, as existing democratic arenas are intensely contaminated\nand disabled by the inequalities socialists criticize and seek to\novercome. The second issue is also relevant here. There is a\ntraditional question whether socialism is to be pursued in one country\nor internationally. The tendency to embrace an internationalist\nhorizon of political change is characteristic among socialists as they\ntypically see their ideals of freedom, equality, and solidarity as\nhaving global scope, while they also note that, as a matter of\nfeasibility, the increasing porousness of borders for capitalist\neconomic activity make it the case that socialist politics may not go\nvery far in any country without reshaping the broader international\ncontext. A difficulty here is that despite the existence of\ninternational social movements (including workers\u2019 movements,\ninternational NGOs, human rights institutions and associations, and\nother actors), institutional agency beyond borders that can seriously\ncontest capitalist frameworks is not currently very strong. In\naddressing these difficulties, action and research on socialist\njustice must interact with ongoing work in the related areas of\ngender, race, democracy, human rights, and global\n justice.[2]\n",
