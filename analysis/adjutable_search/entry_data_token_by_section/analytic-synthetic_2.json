    "main_text": "The Intuitive Distinction || Frege\n1.2 Frege\n\nFrege (1884 [1980], \u00a7\u00a75,88) and others noted a number of\nproblems with Kant\u2019s \u201ccontainment\u201d metaphor. In the\nfirst place, as Kant (1787 [1998], B756) himself would surely have\nagreed, the criterion would need to be freed of\n\u201cpsychologistic\u201d suggestions, or claims about merely the\naccidental thought processes of thinkers, as opposed to claims about\ntruth and justification that are presumably at issue with the\nanalytic. In particular, mere associations are not always matters of\nmeaning: many people in thinking about Columbus may automatically\nthink \u201cthe discoverer of America,\u201d or in thinking about\nthe number 7 they \u201ccan\u2019t help but also think\u201d about\nthe numeral that denotes it, but it\u2019s certainly not analytic\nthat Columbus discovered America, or that a number is identical with a\nnumeral. Moreover, while it may be arguably analytic that a circle is\na closed figure of constant curvature (see Katz, 1972), someone could\nfail to notice this and so think the one without the other.\n\nEven were Kant to have solved this problem, it isn\u2019t clear how\nhis notion of \u201ccontainment\u201d would cover cases that seem to\nbe as \u201canalytic\u201d as any of set II, such as:\n\nIV.\n\n\n(11)\nAnyone who\u2019s an ancestor of an ancestor of Bob is an\nancestor of Bob.\n(12)\nIf Bob is married to Sue, then Sue is married to\nBob.\n(13)\nIf something is red, then it\u2019s colored.\n \n\n\nThe transitivity of ancestor or the symmetry of\nmarried are not obviously \u201ccontained in\u201d the\ncorresponding thoughts in the way that the idea of extension\nis plausibly \u201ccontained in\u201d the notion of body,\nor male in the notion of bachelor. (13) has seemed\nparticularly troublesome: what else besides colored could be\nincluded in the analysis? The concept red involves color\n\u2013 and what else? It is hard to see what else to\n\u201cadd\u201d \u2013 except red itself!\n\nFrege attempted to remedy the situation by completely rethinking the\nfoundations of logic, developing what we now think of as modern\nsymbolic logic. He defined a perfectly precise \u201cformal\u201d\nlanguage, i.e., a language characterized by the \u201cform\u201d\n\u2013 standardly, the shape\u2014of its expressions, and he\ncarefully set out an account of the syntax and semantics of what are\ncalled the \u201clogical constants,\u201d such as \u201cand,\u201d\n\u201cor,\u201d \u201cnot,\u201d \u201call\u201d and\n\u201csome,\u201d showing how to capture a very wide class of valid\ninferences containing them. Saying precisely how the constants are\ndetermined is a matter of controversy (see Logical\nConstants), but, at least roughly and intuitively, they can be\nthought of as those parts of language that don\u2019t\n\u201cpoint\u201d or \u201cfunction referentially,\u201d aiming to\nrefer to something in the world, in the way that ordinary nouns,\nverbs, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions seem to do.\n\u201cSocrates\u201d refers to Socrates, \u201cdogs\u201d to dogs,\n\u201c(is) clever\u201d to cleverness and/or clever things, but\nwords like \u201cor\u201d and \u201call\u201d don\u2019t seem to\nfunction referentially at all. At any rate, it certainly isn\u2019t\nclear that there are any ors and alls in the world,\nalong with Socrates, the dogs, and sets or properties of them.\n\nThis distinction between non-logical, \u201creferring\u201d\nexpressions and logical constants allows us to define a logical truth\nin a way that has become common (and will be particularly useful in\nthis entry) as a sentence that is true no matter what non-logical\nexpressions occur in it (cf. Tarski, 1936 [1983], Quine, 1956\n[1976], Davidson 1980). Consequently (placing non-logical expressions\nin bold, and re-numbering prior examples):\n\n(14)\nAll doctors that specialize on\nchildren are doctors.\n\n\ncounts as a (strict) logical truth: no matter what grammatical\nexpressions we put in for the non-logical terms \u201cdoctor\u201d,\n\u201cspecialize on\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d in (14), the\nsentence will remain true. For example, substituting\n\u201ccats\u201d for \u201cdoctors\u201d, \u201cchase\u201d for\n\u201cspecialize on\u201d and \u201cmice\u201d for\n\u201cchildren,\u201d we get:\n\n(15)\nAll cats that chase mice are cats.\n\n\n(Throughout this discussion, by \u201csubstitution\u201d we shall\nmean uniform substitution of one presumably univocal expression for\nanother in all its occurrences in a sentence.) But what about the\nothers of set II? Substituting \u201ccats\u201d for\n\u201cdoctors\u201d and \u201cmice\u201d for\n\u201cpediatricians\u201d in\n\n(16)\nAll pediatricians are doctors.\n\n\nwe get:\n\n(17)\nAll mice are cats.\n\n\nwhich is obviously false, as would many such substitutions render the\nrest of the examples of II. (14) and (15) are patent logical truths;\ntheir truth depends only upon the semantic values of their logical\nparticles. But All pediatricians are doctors and the other\nexamples, (6)\u2013(8) and (11)\u2013(13), are not formal\nlogical truths, specifiable by the logical form of the\nsentence (or its pattern of logical particles) alone; nor are their\ndenials, e.g., (9) and (10), formal contradictions (i.e., of\nthe form, where \u2018p\u2019 stands in for any\nsentence: \u201cp and it is not the case that\np\u201d). How are we to capture them?\n\nHere Frege appealed to the notion of \u201cdefinition,\u201d or\n\u2014presuming that definitions preserve\n\u201cmeaning\u201d\u2014 \u201csynonymy\u201d: the non-logical\nanalytic truths are those that can be converted to formal logical\ntruths by substitution of definitions for defined terms, or synonyms\nfor synonyms. Since \u201cmice\u201d is not synonymous with\n\u201cpediatrician,\u201d (17) is not a substitution into (16) of\nthe required sort. We need, instead, a substitution of the\ndefinition of \u201cpediatrician,\u201d i.e., \u201cdoctor\nthat specializes on children,\u201d which would convert (16) into our\nearlier purely formal logical truth:\n\n(14)\nAll doctors that specialize on children are doctors.\n\n\nOf course, these notions of definition, meaning and\nsynonymy would themselves need to be clarified, But they were\nthought at the time to be sufficiently obvious notions whose\nclarification didn\u2019t seem particularly urgent until W.V.O. Quine\n(1953 [1980a]) raised serious questions about them much later (see\n\u00a73.3ff below). Putting those questions to one side, Frege made\nspectacularly interesting suggestions, offering a famous definition,\nfor example, of the \u201cancestral\u201d relation involved in (11)\nas a basis for his definition of number (see\nFrege\u2019s Theorem and Foundations for Arithmetic), and\ninspiring the program of \u201clogicism\u201d (or the reduction of\narithmetic to logic) that was pursued in Whitehead and Russell\u2019s\n(1910\u201313) monumental Principia Mathematica, and the\n(early) Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s (1922) Tractatus\nLogico-philosophicus.\n\nFrege was mostly interested in formalizing arithmetic, and so\nconsidered the logical forms of a relative minority of natural\nlanguage sentences in a deliberately spare notation \u2013 he\ndidn\u2019t take on the likes of (12)-(13). But work on the logical\n(or syntactic) structure of the full range of sentences of natural\nlanguage has blossomed since then, initially in the work of Bertrand\nRussell (1905), in his famous theory of definite descriptions (see\nDescriptions), which he (1912) combined with his views about\nthe knowledge by \u201cacquaintance\u201d with sense-data and\nuniversals into a striking \u201cfundamental principle in the\nanalysis of propositions containing descriptions\u201d:\n\n\nEvery proposition which we can understand must be composed wholly of\nconstituents with which we are acquainted (1912:58),\n\n\nan early version of a proposal pursued by Logical Positivists, to be\ndiscussed in the next sections below. Frege\u2019s and\nRussell\u2019s formalizations are also indirectly the inspiration for\nthe subsequent work of Noam Chomsky and other \u201cgenerative\u201d\nlinguists and logicians (see supplement). Whether\nFrege\u2019s criterion of analyticity will work for the rest of II\nand other analyticities depends upon the details of these latter\nproposals, some of which are discussed in the supplement,\n",
