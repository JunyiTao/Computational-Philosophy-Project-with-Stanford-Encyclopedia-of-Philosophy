    "main_text": "Moral Reality and Moral Realism || Moral realism, fact and value, practical reason\n5.4 Moral realism, fact and value, practical reason\n\nMurdoch\u2019s form of moral realism has spurred important and\ninfluential secondary literature that is more engaged than Murdoch\nherself with meta-ethical questions in the Anglo American tradition.\nHilary Putnam credits Murdoch with the critique he develops of the\nfact/value dichotomy, focusing on what Murdoch calls \u201csecondary\nmoral words\u201d (IP: 22/317) and \u201cnormative-descriptive\nwords\u201d (IP: 31/325; Putnam 2002: 34\u201335). (Bernard Williams\nlater influentially referred to these as \u201cthick\u201d moral or\nevaluative concepts, such as cruel, rude, brave, courageous, generous,\nelegant [Williams 1985]). These terms possess descriptive content but\nare also evaluative, and often motivational, contrasting with the more\nabstract moral terms \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, and\n\u201cought\u201d that had dominated British moral philosophy\nthrough the 1950s, and that almost entirely lack the descriptive\nelement. For Putnam there are evaluative facts (\u201cJane\u2019s\nact was courageous\u201d) that have no less standing as describing\nreality than a presumptively non-evaluative fact. Nor, he argues, can\nthe reality reflected in the characterization be factored into two\nunrelated components joined together\u2014an allegedly \u201cpurely\ndescriptive\u201d component, and an evaluation of the content in that\ncomponent\n (point 1 on the Hare list).\n The two dimensions are inextricably \u201centangled\u201d, Putnam\nargues (2002).\n\nThis view thus rejects a common moral non-cognitivist (but shared by\nsome cognitivists) claim that moral properties always\n\u201csupervene\u201d on (that is, apply in virtue of)\nalready-existing non-moral properties. Panizza and Setiya defend this\nimplication of the existence of secondary moral terms (Panizza 2020;\nSetiya 2013). Panizza connects the rejection of supervenience with\nMurdoch\u2019s view that our direct perception of moral properties is\nbound up with the ways that perception is deeply conceptual (Panizza\n2020: 284\u20135; see also Setiya 2013).\n\nOthers have focused more distinctly on Murdoch\u2019s view\u2019s\nimplications for practical reason. John McDowell developed a\nMurdochian-influenced moral realist view, in an influential 1979 paper\n\u201cVirtue and Reason\u201d, often also regarded as a founding\nessay in the contemporary virtue ethics tradition (and indeed McDowell\nsees his view [developed in other papers as well] as both Aristotelian\nand Murdochian) (McDowell 1979, 1998). (More on Murdoch and virtue\nbelow.)\n\nMcDowell says that to possess a virtue, such as kindness, is to\npossess \u201ca reliable sensitivity to a certain sort of requirement\nwhich situations impose on behavior\u201d. Its \n\n\ndeliverances\u2026are cases of knowledge\u2026 [A] kind person\nknows what it is like to be confronted with a requirement of kindness.\nThe sensitivity is, we might say, a sort of perceptual capacity.\n(McDowell 1979 [1997: 142]) \n\n\nMcDowell adds that the reasons for action in particular situations\nthat moral perception cognizes cannot be derived from general\nprinciples but retain a particularistic dimension, also emphasized by\nMurdoch. (See \u201cparticularity\u201d below.)\n\nSetiya agrees with McDowell that for Murdoch reality as accurately\ncognized supplies agents with motivating reasons, including moral\nreasons, for action; this view thus constitutes a form of \u201cmoral\ninternalism\u201d. \u201cRationality belongs to full cognition of\nthe facts\u201d (Setiya 2013: 13). Setiya responds to the objection\nthat a moral agent could apply a moral concept competently to a\nsituation but be unmoved by the moral force of the thus-characterized\nsituation. He notes that Murdoch speaks of \n\n two senses of \u201cknowing what a word means\u201d, one\nconnected with ordinary language and the other very much less so. (IP:\n29/322) \n\n\nThe second sense is the deeper understanding on which her moral\nrealism relies. And the deeper understanding can be both of a concept\nand of an individual person in the situation to which the concept is\nbeing applied (Setiya 2013: 9). Murdoch connects these points to an\naspect of her perfectionism, implying the ideal of perfect\nunderstanding of both individuals and concepts.\n\nBut Setiya disagrees with McDowell\u2019s view that the moral reality\ncognized by the moral agent must take the form of moral requirements\nand indeed, more broadly, with action-guiding features of situations\n(Setiya 2013: 11). Mylonaki criticizes McDowell on similar grounds and\nboth she and Setiya take the \u201cother persons\u201d view of the\nmoral reality Murdoch is concerned with (Mylonaki 2019; Setiya 2013:\n11a). Mylonaki emphasizes, however, that cognizing that reality can\ngive rise to reasons for action.\n",
