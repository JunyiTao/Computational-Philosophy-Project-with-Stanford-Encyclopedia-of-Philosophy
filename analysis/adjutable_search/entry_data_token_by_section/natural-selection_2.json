    "main_text": "Evolution and the Conditions for Natural Selection || Replicator Selectionism\n2.1 Replicator Selectionism\n\nAn alternative approach to stating conditions for natural selection\ninvolves attention to replicators, of which genes are the paradigm\ninstance. This approach was motivated by the discovery of genetic\nvariations that spread despite not being conducive to the\nreproduction of the organisms that bear them, for instance, genes that\nexhibit meiotic drive. Replicator selectionism, which makes\ngenes/replicators the units of selection, was developed in contrast\nwith the Lewontin-style approaches, which make larger entities,\norganisms and even species, units of selection (see entry on\n units and levels of selection).\n\nDawkins defines replicators as anything in the universe of which\ncopies are made (1982: 82). Hull has a similar definition: a\nreplicator is an entity that passes on its structure largely intact in\nsuccessive replications (Hull 1988: 408). Germ-line replicators have\nthe potential to have indefinitely many descendants; they contrast\nwith somatic replicators, the genes found in body cells, which produce\ncopies only as part of mitosis and whose lineages of descendants end\nwhen the body dies. Active replicators have some causal influence on\ntheir probability of being copied in contrast to inactive,\n\u201cneutral\u201d ones, which do not have any effects on\ndevelopment. Natural selection will occur wherever we find active\ngerm-line replicators (Dawkins 1982: 83). Dawkins distinguished\nreplicators from vehicles, his notion meant to replace and generalize\nthat of organism. Hull proposed the notion of interactor as a similar\ncomplement to the notion of replicator. Neither notion, however, is\nmeant to further delineate the circumstances in which selection\noccurs, or to narrow the scope of application of evolutionary theory\n(for further discussion of these notions, see entry on\n units and levels of selection).\n This is evident, for Hull at least, insofar as genes may be both\nreplicators and interactors (1988: 409). \n\nThe view that evolutionary theory is a theory that applies to active\ngerm-line replicators has come under fire from a multitude of\ndirections. Genes need not be germ-line to undergo selection, as it is\nat least arguable that the immune system exhibits selection processes\n(Okasha 2006: 11). Copying is beside the point, since only similarity\nacross generations, rather than identity, is necessary for\nevolutionary change (Godfrey-Smith 2000, 2007 and entries on\n units and levels of selection\n and\n replication and reproduction).\n For his part, Hull seems to agree with this last point, as he allows\nthat organisms might well count as replicators, at least in cases in\nwhich they reproduce asexually (Hull 2001: 28\u201329).\n\nDespite the bevy of attacks on replicator selectionism, replicator\nselectionists have not, to my knowledge at least, been criticized for\nbeing too permissive and allowing that systems that do not evolve\ncount as undergoing selection. But germ-line replicators may exert a\ncausal influence on their probability of being copied without\nspreading in a natural population as a result, as in some cases of\nfrequency-dependent selection of systems already at equilibrium. In\ncases of frequency-dependent selection, variant genes cause their own\nreproduction, but the extent of influence on reproduction is a\nfunction of their frequency. Suppose each type spreads when it is\nrarer. At 50% frequency, the influences of each gene on reproduction\ncancel each other out, and a stable intermediate frequency is the\nresult (for a case of a natural system that behaves this way, see Hori\n1993). Because causing replication may not lead to differential\nreplication in these and other cases, replicator selectionists do not\neffectively take evolution to be necessary for selection while\nLewontin and those who follow his basic approach typically do do\nso.\n",
