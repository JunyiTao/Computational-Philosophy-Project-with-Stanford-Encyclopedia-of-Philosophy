    "main_text": "\n1. Our Ordinary Conception of Perceptual Experience\n\nA.D. Smith claims that what most authors have in mind in talking about\nthe Problem of Perception is the \u201cquestion of whether we can\never directly perceive the physical world\u201d, where \u201cthe\nphysical world\u201d is understood in a realist way: as having\n\u201can existence that is not in any way dependent upon its being...\nperceived or thought about\u201d (2002: 1). The arguments at the\nheart of the Problem of Perception challenge this direct\nrealist perspective on perceptual experience. But since this\nperspective is embedded within our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience, the problem gets to the heart of our ordinary\nways of thinking.\n\nSo, what is our ordinary conception of perceptual experience? And how\ndoes it embed a direct realist perspective?\n1.1 Starting Points\n\nWe conceive of perceptual experiences as occurrences with phenomenal\ncharacter. The phenomenal character of an experience is what it is\nlike for a subject to undergo it (Nagel (1974)). Our ordinary\nconception of perceptual experience emerges from first-personal\nreflection on its character, rather than from scientific\ninvestigation; it is a conception of experience from a \u201cpurely\nphenomenological point of view\u201d (Broad 1952: 3\u20134). We\u2019ll\npresent this conception by outlining what phenomenological reflection\nsuggests first about the objects\n (\u00a71.2),\n structure\n (\u00a71.3),\n and character\n (\u00a71.5)\n of experience, and then about the relation between veridical,\nillusory, and hallucinatory experiences, and in particular whether\nthese cases form a common kind\n (\u00a71.6).\n\nLet\u2019s begin with P.F. Strawson\u2019s idea that \u201cmature\nsensible experience (in general) presents itself as, in Kantian\nphrase, an immediate consciousness of the existence of things outside\nus\u201d (1979: 97), and similarly McDowell\u2019s idea that\nperceptual experience appears to be an \u201copenness to the\nworld\u201d (1994: 111), conceived of as openness to mind-independent\nreality (1994: 25\u201326).\n\nThese ideas reflect the basic phenomenological observation that\nperceptual experiences have objects, and more specifically direct\nobjects: objects that are simply perceived or experienced, but not in\nvirtue of the perception or experience of distinct, more\n\u201cimmediate\u201d, objects.\n\nVarious authors appeal to a notion of directness in outlining our\nordinary conception of perceptual experience, and the Problem of\nPerception. A dissenting voice is Austin (1962), and for recent\ncritical discussion see Martin (2017). For further discussion of how\nto understand notions of direct and indirect perception, see Jackson\n(1977), Snowdon (1992), Foster (2000), Smith (2002), and Martin\n(2005).\n\nThis starting point gives rise to the following questions (cf. Martin\n1998: 176):\n\nThe Objects Question: what is the nature of the direct\nobjects of experience?\nThe Structure Question: in what sense are experiences directly\nof their objects? \n\n\nLet\u2019s turn to the answers to these questions suggested by\nStrawson and McDowell\u2019s remarks (for a more critical stance on\nthese remarks see Mackie (2020)).\n1.2 Ordinary Objects\n\nStrawson begins his argument by asking how someone might typically\nrespond to a request for a description of their current visual\nexperience. He says that it is natural to give the following kind of\nanswer: \u201cI see the red light of the setting sun filtering\nthrough the black and thickly clustered branches of the elms; I see\nthe dappled deer grazing in groups on the vivid green\ngrass\u2026\u201d (1979: 97). There are two ideas implicit in this\nanswer. First, the description talks about objects which are things\ndistinct from experience. Second, the description is\n\u201crich\u201d, describing the nature of the experience not merely\nin terms of simple shapes and colours; but in terms of the familiar\nthings we encounter in the \u201clived world\u201d in all their\ncomplexity (see also Heidegger (1977: 156)).\n\nSo, we can highlight the following answer to the Objects Question:\n\nOrdinary Objects: perceptual experiences are\ndirectly of ordinary mind-independent objects.\n\n\nThere are three things to clarify about this. First, it incorporates\nrealism in that it appeals to the notion of a mind-independent object\nof experience: one that doesn\u2019t depend for its existence upon\nexperience. Second, it concerns familiar or ordinary objects, things\nthat we admit as part of common-sense ontology. Third, \u201cobject\nof experience\u201d is understood broadly to encompass perceptible\nentities in mind-independent reality including ordinary material\nobjects, but also features and other entities (e.g., events,\nquantities of stuff). When we talk of \u201cordinary objects\u201d,\n\u201cthe world\u201d etc, we take this as shorthand for: familiar\nor ordinary mind-independent perceptible entities.\n\nSome writers have defended a thesis known as the transparency of\nexperience (see Harman (1990); Speaks (2009); Tye (1992, 1995, 2000);\nThau (2002); and for critical discussions, Martin (2002a), Smith\n(2008), Stoljar (2004) and Soteriou (2013)).\nTransparency is normally defined as the thesis that\nintrospecting what it is like for a subject to have an experience does\nnot reveal awareness of experiences themselves, but only of their\nmind-independent objects. There are two claims here: (i) introspection\nreveals the mind-independent objects of experience, and (ii)\nintrospection does not reveal any features of anything else.\n\nTransparency is similar to Ordinary\nObjects. The latter claim does involve something like (i).\nBut it does not involve (ii). And it is not obvious that (ii) is part\nof our ordinary conception of perceptual experience. After all, we\nreadily admit that an ordinary scene (e.g., a snow-covered churchyard)\ncan look very different when one removes one\u2019s glasses:\none\u2019s visual experience then becomes blurred. But this\nphenomenal difference does not seem to derive from any apparent\ndifference in the objects of experience. Rather, it seems to be a\ndifference in the way in which those objects are experienced. (See Tye\n(2000) and Gow (2019) for different responses. For further discussion,\nsee Crane (2000), Smith (2008), Allen (2013), and French (2014). For a\ndifferent challenge to (ii) and its ilk see Richardson (2010) and\nSoteriou (2013: Chapter 5), and French (2018)).\n1.3 Presentation\n\nWhat, then, about the Structure Question? Strawson speaks of the\nmanner in which we directly experience objects as a matter of\n\u201cimmediate consciousness\u201d, and McDowell talks of our\n\u201copenness\u201d to objects. Other notions commonly invoked here\ninclude the idea that we are directly \u201cacquainted\u201d with\nobjects, we directly \u201capprehend\u201d them, they are\n\u201cgiven\u201d to us, or directly \u201cpresent to the\nmind\u201d. What these notions all aim to capture is the intuitive\nidea that perceptual experience of an object involves a special\nintimate perceptual relation to an object, a relation which\ndifferentiates perceptual experiences from non-perceptual states of\nmind which are similarly directed on the world (e.g., non-sensory,\nnon-perceptual thoughts).\n\nOne function of this relation is to make objects present in such a way\nthat they can shape or mould the character of one\u2019s experience.\nIn virtue of this, perceptions of the world are unlike\n(non-perceptual) thoughts about the world: they are constrained by the\nobjects actually given. One\u2019s perception of a snow-covered\nchurchyard is responsive to how the churchyard is now, as one is\nperceiving it. But one\u2019s (non-perceptual) thought need not be:\nin the middle of winter, one can imagine the churchyard as it is in\nspring, and one can think of it in all sorts of ways which are not the\nways it presently is.\n\nIn what follows we will use the notion of perceptual presentation to\ncapture this perceptual relation. We can thus highlight the following\nanswer to the structure question: \n\nPresentation: perceptual experiences are direct\nperceptual presentations of their objects.\n\n\nIn what follows, we use \u201cdirect presentation\u201d for\nshort.\n1.4 Direct Realism\n\nPutting the pieces together, our ordinary conception of perceptual\nexperience involves:\n\nDirect Realist Presentation: perceptual\nexperiences are direct perceptual presentations of ordinary\nobjects.\n\n\nIf direct perceptual presentation of an ordinary object is a way of\ndirectly perceiving it, then this gives us:\n\nDirect Realism: we can directly perceive ordinary\nobjects.\n\n1.5 The Character of Experience\n\nWe can now shed light on the phenomenal character of perceptual\nexperience. Consider, then, the following question:\n\nThe Character Question: what determines the phenomenal character\nof experience?\n\n\nWe began with the basic phenomenological observation that perceptual\nexperiences are directly of things. A similarly basic observation is\nthat what it is like for us to experience is at least partly a matter\nof such things appearing certain ways to us. When we reflect upon what\ndetermines what it is like to have an experience, we naturally begin\nwith what is presented to us, and how it is presented. This is why it\nis so natural for Strawson to describe his experience in terms of what\nhe perceives, and for Martin to say that \u201cour awareness of what\nan experience is like is inextricably bound up with knowledge of what\nis presented to one in having such experience\u201d (1998: 173).\n\nFurther, when we reflect upon what determines what it is like for us\nto experience, we naturally begin with the ordinary objects that are\npresented to us, and how they are presented or appear. This is why it\nis so natural for Strawson to describe his experience in terms of such\nobjects, and why many find (at least component (i) of) Transparency\nintuitive.\n\nSo, we can highlight the following answer to the Character\nQuestion:\n\nDirect Realist Character: the phenomenal\ncharacter of experience is determined, at least partly, by the\ndirect presentation of ordinary objects.\n\n1.6 The Common Kind Claim\n\nPerceptual experiences are not just veridical experiences: there are\nillusions and hallucinations too. What does phenomenological\nreflection say about how these cases relate to each other? More\nspecifically:\n\nThe Common Kind Question: are veridical, illusory, and\nhallucinatory experiences fundamentally the same, do they form of a\ncommon kind?\n\n\nIn the context of the Problem of Perception, these cases are usually\ndistinguished as follows: a veridical experience is an experience in\nwhich an ordinary object is perceived, and where the object appears as\nit is; an illusory experience is an experience in which an ordinary\nobject is perceived, and where the object appears other than it is; a\nhallucination is an experience which seems to the subject exactly like\na veridical perception of an ordinary object but where there is no\nsuch perceived or presented object. (For illusions and hallucinations\nwhich don\u2019t fit these forms, see Johnston (2011), and Batty and\nMacpherson (2016)).\n\nClearly, there are differences between these categories, but from a\nphenomenological point of view, these experiences seem the same in at\nleast this sense: for any veridical perception of an ordinary object,\nwe can imagine a corresponding illusion or hallucination which cannot\nbe told apart or distinguished, by introspection, from the veridical\nperception. This suggests the following answer to the Common Kind\nQuestion:\n\nCommon Kind Claim: veridical, illusory, and\nhallucinatory experiences (as) of an F are fundamentally the same;\nthey form a common kind.\n\n\nThus, a veridical, illusory, and hallucinatory experience, all alike\nin being experiences (as) of a churchyard covered in white snow, are\nnot merely superficially similar, they are fundamentally the same:\nthese experiences have the same nature, fundamentally the same kind of\nexperiential event is occurring in each case. Any differences between\nthem are external to their nature as experiences (e.g., to do with how\nthey are caused).\n2. The Problem of Perception\n\nThe Problem of Perception is that if illusions and hallucinations are\npossible, then perceptual experience, as we ordinarily understand it,\nis impossible. The Problem is animated by two central arguments: the\nargument from illusion (\u00a72.1) and the argument from hallucination\n(\u00a72.2). (A similar problem arises with reference to other\nperceptual phenomena such as perspectival variation or conflicting\nappearances: see Burnyeat (1979) and the entry on sense-data). For\nsome classic readings on these arguments, see Moore (1905, 1910);\nRussell (1912); Price (1932); Broad (1965); and Ayer (1940), see\nSwartz (1965) for a good collection of readings. And for more recent\nexpositions see Snowdon (1992), Valberg (1992), Robinson (1994:\nChapter 2), Smith (2002: Chapters 1 and 7), Martin (2006), Fish (2009:\nChapter 2), Brewer (2011: Chapter 1) and Pautz (2021).\n\nThe two central arguments have a similar structure which we can\ncapture as follows:\n\nIn an illusory/hallucinatory experience, a subject is not directly\npresented with an ordinary object.\nThe same account of experience must apply to veridical experiences\nas applies to illusory/hallucinatory experiences.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nSubjects are never directly presented with ordinary objects.\n\n\n(C) contradicts Direct Realist Presentation, and thus our ordinary\nconception of perceptual experience. And since Direct Realism seems to\nfollow from Direct Realist Presentation, the argument challenges\nDirect Realism too (for more on this see\n \u00a73.2.6).\n\nRepresenting the arguments in this basic form enables us to highlight\ntheir two major movements; what Paul Snowdon calls the base case, and\nthe spreading step (1992, 2005). In the base case a conclusion about\njust illusory/hallucinatory experiences is sought: (A). In the\nspreading step, (B), this result is generalised so as to get (C). This\ngeneralising move works on these background assumptions: (a1) that (B)\nyields the claim that one is not directly presented with ordinary\nobjects in veridical experiences (given (A)), and (a2) if one is not\ndirectly presented with such objects in even veridical experiences,\none never is.\n\nWe\u2019ll look at more complex versions of the argument shortly. As\nwe\u2019ll see, the main burden on the arguer from illusion is in\nsupporting the relevant version of (A), whereas the main burden on the\narguer from hallucination is in defending the relevant version of\n(B).\n\nNow, the argument here is purely negative. But many philosophers have\nmoved from this to the further conclusion that since we are always\ndirectly presented with something in perceptual experience, what we\nare presented with is a \u201cnon-ordinary\u201d object (see\n \u00a73.1.2).\n2.1 The Argument from Illusion\n\nApplying the above structure, the argument from illusion is:\n\nIn illusory experiences, we are not directly presented with\nordinary objects.\nThe same account of experience must apply to veridical experiences\nas applies to illusory experiences.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nWe are never directly presented with ordinary objects.\n\n\nMoving beyond the simple formulation, the argument is typically\npresented as involving these steps, for an arbitrary subject S:\n\nIn an illusion, it seems to S that something has a sensible\nquality, F, which the ordinary object supposedly being perceived does\nnot have.\nWhen it seems to S that something has a sensible quality, F, then\nthere is something directly presented to S which does have this\nquality.\nSince the ordinary object in question is, by hypothesis, not-F,\nthen it follows that in an illusion, S is not directly presented with\nthe ordinary object supposedly being perceived.\nThe same account of experience must apply to both veridical and\nillusory experiences.\n\n\nTherefore, \n\nIn veridical experience, S is not directly presented with the\nordinary object supposedly being perceived.\nIf S is not directly presented with the ordinary object supposedly\nbeing perceived in veridical experience, S is never directly presented\nwith an ordinary object.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nWe are never directly presented with ordinary objects.\n\n\nThe most controversial premise here is premise (ii). The others\nreflect intuitive ways of thinking about perceptual experience, or\nplausible assumptions. This is clear enough with (i) and (iv). Premise\n(i) articulates the operative conception of illusions. An example to\nillustrate is a case where a white wall looks yellow to you, in\npeculiar lighting (Smith (2002: 25)). And premise (vi) reflects the\nintuitive idea that if we aren\u2019t directly presented with the\nordinary objects we seem to perceive in veridical experiences, then we\naren\u2019t directly presented with ordinary objects at all. For it\nwould be implausible to relinquish the idea that we are directly\npresented with the ordinary objects we seem to perceive in veridical\nexperience, yet maintain that we can still somehow else be directly\npresented with ordinary objects, e.g., with the idea that\nhallucinations are direct presentations of ordinary objects, or with\nthe idea that veridical experiences are direct presentations of\nordinary objects just not those we seem to perceive.\n\nBut what about (iv)? On one way of interpreting this, it reflects the\nCommon Kind Claim applied to veridical experiences\nand illusions. Furthermore, various authors hold that (iv) is\nsupported by the continuity between veridical experiences and illusory\nexperience (Price (1932: 32), Ayer (1940: 8\u20139), Broad (1952: 9),\nRobinson (1994: 57), Smith (2002: 26\u201328): the fact that they may form\na \u201ccontinuous series\u201d in which they \u201cshade into one\nanother\u201d (Ayer (1940: 8\u20139)). This, it is held, supports the idea\nthat experiential differences between illusions and veridical\nperceptions are differences of \u201cdegree and not of kind\u201d\n(Ayer (1940: 8)).\n\nPremise (ii) is a version of what Robinson calls the Phenomenal\nPrinciple:\n\n\nIf there sensibly appears to a subject to be something which possesses\na particular sensible quality then there is something of which the\nsubject is aware which does possess that sensible quality (1994: 32).\n\n\n\nC.D. Broad motivates this principle on explanatory grounds. In cases\nof perceptual experience things appear some ways rather than others to\nus. We need to explain this. Why does the penny look elliptical to you\nas opposed to some other shape? One answer is that there is something\ndirectly presented to you which is in fact elliptical. Thus, as Broad\nsays \u201cIf, in fact, nothing elliptical is before my mind, it is\nvery hard to understand why the penny should seem elliptical rather\nthan of any other shape.\u201d (1923: 240). Other philosophers have\nsimply taken the principle to be obvious. H.H. Price, for example,\nsays that \u201cWhen I say \u2018this table appears brown to\nme\u2019 it is quite plain that I am acquainted with an actual\ninstance of brownness\u201d (1932: 63).\n\nSo much for the argument\u2019s main premises. How is it supposed to\nwork? Here we find the suggestion that it hinges on an application of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals (Robinson\n(1994: 32); Smith (2002: 25)). The point is that (i) and (ii) tell us\nthat in an illusory experience you are directly presented with an F\nthing, but the ordinary object supposedly being perceived is not F,\nthus the F thing and the ordinary object are not identical, by\nLeibniz\u2019s Law. On these grounds, the conclusion of the base case\nis supposed to follow. And then the ultimate conclusion of the\nargument can be derived from its further premises.\n\nBut as French and Walters (2018) argue, this is invalid. (i), (ii) and\nLeibniz\u2019s Law entail that in an illusory experience you are\ndirectly presented with an F thing which is non-identical to the\nordinary object supposedly being perceived. However, this\ndoesn\u2019t entail that in the illusion you are not directly\npresented with the ordinary object. You might be directly presented\nwith the ordinary object as well as the F thing. We should be careful\nto distinguish not being directly presented with the ordinary object\nfrom being directly presented with something which is not the ordinary\nobject (e.g., between not being directly presented with the white\nwall, and being directly presented with something that is not the\nwhite wall, e.g., a yellow entity). The argument is invalid in\nconflating these two ideas.\n\nOne option for fixing the argument is to introduce what French and\nWalters call the Exclusion Assumption (cf., Snowdon\n(1992: 74)): If in an illusion of an ordinary object as F, a subject\nis directly presented with an F thing non-identical to the ordinary\nobject, then they are not also directly presented with the ordinary\nobject. \n\nThis assumption bridges the gap between the conclusion actually\nachieved: namely, in an illusory experience S is directly presented\nwith an F thing non-identical to the ordinary object, and the desired\nconclusion (iii). But whether this assumption is defensible remains to\nbe seen. We leave this and the issue of validity aside and consider\nresponses from different theories of experience below.\n2.2 The Argument From Hallucination\n\nThe argument from hallucination relies on the possibility of\nhallucinations as understood above. Such hallucinations are not like\nreal drug-induced hallucinations or hallucinations suffered by those\nwith certain mental disorders. They are rather supposed to be merely\npossible events. For example, suppose you are now having a veridical\nperception of a snow-covered churchyard. The assumption that\nhallucinations are possible means that you could have an experience\nwhich is subjectively indistinguishable\u2014that is,\nindistinguishable by you, \u201cfrom the inside\u201d\u2014from a\nveridical perception of a snow-covered churchyard, but where there is\nin fact no churchyard presented or there to be perceived. The claim\nthat such hallucinations are possible is widely accepted but not\nindisputable (see Austin (1962) and Masrour (2020)). For more on\nhallucinations, see Macpherson and Platchias (2013).\n\nThe argument from hallucination runs as follows:\n\nIn hallucinatory experiences, we are not directly presented with\nordinary objects\nThe same account of experience must apply to veridical experiences\nas applies to hallucinatory experiences.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nWe are never directly presented with ordinary objects.\n\n\nUnlike with the argument from illusion, the base case doesn\u2019t\nrely on the Phenomenal Principle: (A) simply falls\nout of what hallucinations are supposed to be.\n\nThe spreading step can be interpreted in terms of the Common\nKind Claim, applied to veridical experiences and\nhallucinations. Accepting (B) understood in this way puts a constraint\non what can be said about the nature of veridical experience: whatever\ncan be said had better be able to apply to hallucinations too. The\nargument is that, given (A), this then rules out an account of\nveridical experiences as direct presentations of ordinary objects. But\nthen (C) follows (given that if we are not directly presented with\nordinary objects in veridical experience, we never are).\n\nWith the argument understood in this way, we can see the power of the\nProblem of Perception. (A) is intuitive, and (B) is part of our\nordinary conception of perceptual experience, yet what follows, (C),\ncontradicts another aspect of our ordinary conception (Direct\nRealist Presentation). Thus, the very intelligibility of our\nordinary conception of perceptual experience is threatened.\n\nNow it might be argued that the Common Kind Claim\napplied to veridical perceptions and hallucinations is not as\nplausible as it is when applied to veridical perceptions and\nillusions. For veridical and illusory experiences are more naturally\ngrouped together anyway, unlike veridical perceptions and\nhallucinations. For, at least before we encounter the argument from\nillusion, veridical perceptions and illusions are both naturally\nthought of as direct presentations of ordinary objects (it\u2019s\njust that in illusory cases the presented objects appear other than\nthey are). However, as noted above, from a phenomenological\npoint of view, hallucinations too seem as though they are direct\npresentations of ordinary objects: from the subject\u2019s\nperspective a hallucination as of an F cannot be distinguished\nfrom a veridical experience of an F. This is why it seems so plausible\nto think of them as fundamentally the same.\n\nEven so, the Common Kind Claim applied to veridical\nperceptions and hallucinations is controversial, and rejecting it is\ncentral to the disjunctivist response to the Problem of\nPerception that we will consider later\n (\u00a73.4).\n3. Theories of Experience\n\nA number of philosophical theories of experience have emerged as\nresponses to the Problem of Perception, or in relation to such\nresponses. Here we consider the sense-datum theory\n (\u00a73.1),\n adverbialism\n (\u00a73.2),\n intentionalism\n (\u00a73.3),\n and naive realist disjunctivism\n (\u00a73.4).\n In this exposition we do not consider much the possibility of hybrid\nviews. The way these positions relate to the Problem of Perception is\nmapped most clearly in Martin (1995, 1998, 2000).\n\nWe present these theories as operating on two levels. On Level 1, they\ntell us about the nature of experience. With the exception of\nadverbialism (for reasons that will emerge shortly), this can be\ninvestigated by considering the stance of each theory on the nature of\nthe objects of experience, and the structure of our experience of\nobjects. On Level 2, they tell us how what is said at the first level\nbears on the explanation of the character of experience. We also\nconsider how each theory addresses the common kind question.\n\nIn what follows, we\u2019ll work with the example of a visual\nexperience of a snow-covered churchyard. To simplify, we will discuss\nthe character of this experience in terms of one aspect of it: things\nlooking white to a subject. The question at Level 1 is: what is the\nnature of such an experience? Does it involve the direct presentation\nof objects, or not? If so, what sorts of objects? If not, how are we\nto understand the nature of this experience? The question at Level 2\nis: what is it about the nature of this experience that explains why\nthings look any way at all to someone, and why they look,\nspecifically, white?\n3.1 The Sense-Datum Theory\n3.1.1 The Sense-Datum Theory in Outline\n\nWhat does the sense-datum theorist say at Level 1? On this theory,\nwhenever a subject has a sensory experience, there is something which\nis presented to them. This relational conception of experience is\nsometimes called an \u201cact-object\u201d conception, since it\nposits a distinction between the mental act of being presented with\nsomething, and the object presented. More precisely, the sense-datum\ntheorist holds that an experience in which something appears F to S,\nwhere F is a sensible quality (e.g., whiteness), consists in S being\ndirectly presented with something which actually is F (e.g. a white\nthing). They thus endorse the aforementioned Phenomenal\nPrinciple. The sense-datum theorist calls these objects of\nperception \u201csense-data\u201d.\n\nUnderstood in this way, a sense-datum is just whatever it is\nthat you are directly presented with that instantiates the sensible\nqualities which characterise the character of your experience. This\ninvolves no further claim about the nature of sense-data,\nthough as we\u2019ll see shortly, sense-datum theorists do go on to\nmake further claims about the nature of sense-data.\n\nWhat about Level 2? With respect to our example, the sense-datum\ntheorist claims that things appearing any way at all to you consists\nin the fact that you are directly presented with a sense-datum, and\nthings appearing white to you consists in the fact that you are\ndirectly presented with a white sense-datum. The character of your\nexperience is explained by an actual instance of whiteness manifesting\nitself in experience.\n\nThe sense-datum theorist endorses the Common Kind\nClaim. So, a veridical experience in which something appears\nwhite to you consists in your being directly presented with a white\nsense-datum; but so do corresponding illusory and hallucinatory\nexperiences. These experiences have the same nature.\n3.1.2 The Sense-Datum Theory and the Problem of Perception\n\nThe sense-datum theorist endorses the following negative claim:\n\nWe are never directly presented with ordinary objects.\n\n\nThey accept this on the basis of the arguments from illusion and\nhallucination. However, the intended contrast with Direct Realist\nPresentation usually involves a stronger claim:\n\nWe are only ever directly presented with sense-data,\nwhich are non-ordinary objects. \n\n\nThis involves a positive claim about what we are directly\npresented with, given that we are never directly presented with\nordinary objects. And it embeds a claim about the nature of sense-data\nthat goes beyond that outlined above: now sense-data are understood as\nnon-ordinary objects.\n\nSense-datum theorists divide over exactly how to understand sense-data\ninsofar as they are non-ordinary. Some early sense-datum theorists\n(such as Moore) initially took sense-data to be mind-independent, but\npeculiar non-physical objects. Later theorists treat sense-data as\nmind-dependent entities (Robinson (1994)). This is how the theory\ntends to be understood in literature from second half of the 20th\ncentury on. \n\nSense-datum theorists have developed more positive Problem of\nPerception style reasoning to support these additional ideas. For\ninstance, Macpherson (2013: 12\u201313) outlines a more complicated version\nof the argument from hallucination than that above which concludes\nthat \u201cAll perceptual experience, hallucinatory and\nnon-hallucinatory, involves awareness of a mind-dependent, nonphysical\nobject\u2014a sense-datum\u201d. And some sense-datum theorists have\nattempted to support non-ordinary sense-data outside of the context of\nthe Problem of Perception (see Jackson (1977) and Lowe (1992)).\n\nFrom now on when we speak of \u201csense-data\u201d we will mean\nnon-ordinary sense-data, and when we speak of the \u201csense-datum\ntheory\u201d we have in mind a theory that endorses not just (1) but\n(2).\n3.1.3 The Sense-Datum Theory and Our Ordinary Conception of Perceptual Experience\n\nThe sense-datum theorist agrees with some aspects of our ordinary\nconception of perceptual experience. They endorse the Common\nKind Claim. They also endorse Presentation\n\u2013 the idea that the direct objects of experience are\nperceptually presented to us. It\u2019s just that they don\u2019t\nagree that the direct objects of experience are ordinary objects\n\u2013 they are non-ordinary sense-data. They thus reject\nOrdinary Objects, and hence Direct Realist\nPresentation, and Direct Realist\nCharacter.\n3.1.4 The Sense-Datum Theory and Perception of the World\n\nIs the sense-datum theory a theory on which we completely lose contact\nwith the world, a theory on which we cannot perceive the world?\n\nThough it is possible for a sense-datum theorist to accept this, a\nmore popular position has been one on which we still have some form of\nperception of the world, just not direct perception. That is, the\nsense-datum theorist can say that we indirectly perceive ordinary\nobjects: we perceive them by being directly presented with sense-data.\nA sense-datum theorist who says this is known as an indirect realist\nor representative realist (see the entry on\n epistemological problems of perception).\n The task for such a sense-datum theorist is to spell out how the\ndirect presentation of sense-data can lead to indirect perception of\nordinary objects. This is something early sense-datum theorists\npursued by asking how sense-data are related to ordinary objects. A\ntheorist who denies that we perceive mind-independent objects at all,\ndirectly or indirectly, but only sense-data construed as mental\nentities, is known as a phenomenalist or an idealist (see Foster\n(2000), see Crane and Farkas (2004: Section 2) for an introduction to\nthe subject; and the entry on\n idealism).\n3.1.5 Objections to the Sense-Datum Theory\n\nThe sense-datum theory was widely rejected in the second half of the\n20th century, though it still had its occasional champions (e.g.,\nJackson (1977), O\u2019Shaughnessy (2000, 2003), Lowe (1992),\nRobinson (1994), Foster (2000)). A number of objections have been made\nto the theory. Some of these are objections specifically to the\nindirect realist version: for example, the claim that the theory gives\nrise to an unacceptable \u201cveil of perception\u201d between mind\nand world. The idea is that sense-data \u201cinterpose\u201d\nthemselves between perceivers and ordinary objects, and therefore\nproblematise our perceptual, cognitive, and epistemic access to the\nworld. In response, the indirect realist can say that sense-data are\nthe medium by which we perceive ordinary objects, and no more create a\n\u201cveil of perception\u201d than the fact that we use words to\ntalk about things creates a \u201cveil of words\u201d between us and\nwhat we talk about. (For recent discussion see Silins (2011)).\n\nA common objection is to attack the Phenomenal\nPrinciple (see Barnes (1944\u20135); Anscombe (1965)). The\nobjection is that the Phenomenal Principle is\nfallacious. It is not built into the meaning of \u201csomething\nappears F to one\u201d that \u201cone is directly presented with an\nF thing\u201d. Defenders of the sense-datum theory can respond that\nthe Phenomenal Principle is not supposed to be a purely\nlogical inference; it is not supposed to be true simply because\nof the logical form or semantic structure of \u201cappears\u201d and\nsimilar locutions. Rather, it is true because of specific\nphenomenological facts about perceptual experience. But this just\nmeans that theorists who reject the Phenomenal Principle are not\ndisagreeing about whether the Phenomenal Principle involves a fallacy\nor about some semantic issue, but rather about the nature of\nexperience itself.\n\nAnother influential objection to sense-data comes from the prevailing\nnaturalism of contemporary philosophy. Naturalism (or physicalism)\nsays that the world is entirely physical in its nature: everything\nthere is supervenes on the physical, and is governed by physical law.\nMany sense-datum theorists are committed to the claim that\nnon-ordinary sense-data are mind-dependent: objects whose existence\ndepends on the existence of states of mind. Is this consistent with\nnaturalism? If so, the challenge is to explain how an object can be\nbrought into existence by the existence of an experience, and how this\nis supposed to be governed by physical law.\n\nMany contemporary sense-datum theorists, however, will not be moved by\nthis challenge, since they are happy to accept the rejection of\nnaturalism as a consequence of their theory (Robinson (1994), Foster\n(2000)). On the other hand, one might think that there is no conflict\nhere with naturalism, as long as experiences themselves are part of\nthe natural order. But if sense-data are non-ordinary in being\nmind-independent but non-physical, then it is much less clear\nhow naturalism can be maintained (cf., what Martin (2004, 2006) calls\n\u201cexperiential naturalism\u201d which serves as a constraint on\ntheories of experience and rules out some but not all forms of the\nsense-datum theory).\n\nFor other objections to the sense-datum theory, including the worry\nthat it must admit \u201cindeterminate\u201d sense-data (e.g., on\nthe basis of seeing a speckled hen, which appears to have a number of\nspeckles but no definite number), see the entry on\n sense-data.\n3.2 Adverbialism\n3.2.1 Adverbialism in Outline\n\nPart of the point of adverbialism, as defended by Ducasse (1942) and\nChisholm (1957) is to do justice to the phenomenology of experience\nwhilst avoiding the dubious metaphysical commitments of the\nsense-datum theory. The only entities which the adverbialist needs to\nacknowledge are subjects of experience, experiences themselves, and\nways these experiences are modified. Let us explain.\n\nAt Level 1, the adverbialist rejects the Phenomenal Principle\nand the whole idea that experience consists in being directly\npresented with perceptible entities. For the adverbialist, when\nsomeone has an experience of something white, something like whiteness\nis instantiated, but in the experience itself, not a presented thing.\nThis is not to say that the experience is white, but rather that the\nexperience is modified in a certain way, the way we can call\n\u201cperceiving whitely\u201d. The canonical descriptions of\nperceptual experiences, then, employ adverbial modifications of the\nperceptual verbs: instead of describing an experience as\nsomeone\u2019s \u201cvisually sensing a white sphere\u201d, the\ntheory says that they are \u201cvisually sensing whitely and\nspherely\u201d. This is why this theory is called the\n\u201cadverbial theory\u201d; but it is important to emphasize that\nit is more a theory about the nature of experience itself than it is a\nsemantic analysis of sentences describing experience.\n\nIt is also intended as a theory of the character of experience (Level\n2). The adverbialist claims that things appearing white to you\nconsists in you sensing whitely. It is because you are\nsensing in some way that explains why things appear a certain\nway to you at all, and it is the fact that you are sensing\nwhitely that explains why things appear white to\nyou, rather than some other way. The character of your experience is\nexplained by the specific \u201cwhite\u201d way in which your\nexperience is modified.\n\nThe adverbialist endorses the Common Kind Claim. So,\na veridical experience in which something appears white to you,\nconsists in you sensing whitely, but so do corresponding illusory and\nhallucinatory experiences: these experiences have the same nature.\n3.2.2 Adverbialism and Qualia\n\nWhen used in a broad way, \u201cqualia\u201d picks out whatever\nqualities a state of mind has which constitute the state of\nmind\u2019s having the phenomenal character it has. In this broad\nsense, any phenomenally conscious state of mind has qualia. (This is\nthe way the term is used in, e.g., Chalmers (1996)). Used in a narrow\nway, however, qualia are non-intentional, intrinsic properties of\nexperience: properties which have no intentional or representational\naspects whatsoever. To use Gilbert Harman\u2019s apt metaphor, qualia\nin this sense are \u201cmental paint\u201d properties (1990). Harman\nrejects mental paint, but the idea of experience as involving mental\npaint is defended by Block (2004)).\n\nIt is relatively uncontroversial to say that there are qualia in the\nbroad sense. It can be misleading, however, to use the term in this\nway, since it can give rise to the illusion that the existence of\nqualia is a substantial philosophical thesis when in fact it is\nsomething which will be accepted by anyone who believes in phenomenal\ncharacter. (Hence Dennett\u2019s (1991) denial of qualia can seem\nbewildering if \u201cqualia\u201d is taken in the broad sense). It\nis controversial to say that there are qualia in the narrow sense,\nthough, and those who have asserted their existence have therefore\nprovided arguments and thought-experiments to defend this assertion\n(see Block (1997), Peacocke (1983: Chapter 1), Shoemaker (1990)). In\nwhat follows, \u201cqualia\u201d will be used exclusively in the\nnarrow sense.\n\nAs noted, adverbialism is committed to the view that experiencing\nsomething white, for example, involves your experience being modified\nin a certain way: experiencing whitely. A natural way to understand\nthis is in terms of the idea that the experience is an event, and the\nmodification of it is a property of that event. Since this property is\nboth intrinsic (as opposed to relational or representational) and\nphenomenal then this way of understanding adverbialism is committed to\nthe existence of qualia.\n3.2.3 Objections to Adverbialism\n\nAn important objection to adverbialism is the \u201cMany Property\nProblem\u201d proposed by Frank Jackson (1975). Consider someone who\nsenses a brown square and a green triangle simultaneously. The\nadverbialist will characterize this state of mind as \u201csensing\nbrownly and squarely and greenly and triangularly\u201d. But how can\nthey distinguish the state of mind they are describing in this way\nfrom that of sensing a brown triangle and a green square? The\ncharacterization fits that state of mind equally well. Obviously, what\nis wanted is a description according to which the brownness\n\u201cgoes with\u201d the squareness, and the greenness \u201cgoes\nwith\u201d the triangularity. But how is the adverbialist to do this\nwithout introducing objects of experience\u2014the things which are\nbrown and green respectively\u2014or a visual field with a spatial\nstructure? The challenge is whether the adverbialist can properly\naccount for the spatial structure and complexity in what is given in\nvisual experience. See Tye (1984), Breckenridge (2018: Chapter 10),\nand D\u2019Ambrosio (2019) for adverbialist responses to this\nchallenge. For a helpful overview, see Fish (2010: Chapter 3).\n\nA further challenge is that adverbialism is \u201cincapable of doing\njustice to the most obvious and indeed essential phenomenological fact\nabout perceptual consciousness\u2026 namely\u2026 its\nobject-directness\u201d (Butchvarov (1980: 272)). Recall here the\nbasic phenomenological observation we began with: perceptual\nexperiences are directly of things.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, at Level 1, the adverbialist denies that\nperceptual experiences are direct presentations of objects. And at\nLevel 2, in explaining character, the adverbialist assigns no role to\nthe direct presentation of things, just ways of sensing. But then if\nit is an aspect of the phenomenology of experience that our\nexperiences have direct objects, then it is not clear that the\nadverbialist has the resources to capture this. For the adverbialist,\nto capture your experience of a snow-covered churchyard we invoke\nseeing whitely not seeing a white thing. How, then, can we\nexplain why phenomenologically, your experience is directly\nof a white thing \u2013 or even why it seems to be object-directed in\nthis way? Butchvarov\u2019s charge is that the adverbialist\ndoesn\u2019t have the resources to answer these questions. (See\nD\u2019Ambrosio (2019) for a recent adverbialist attempt to capture\nsomething like object-directness).\n3.2.4 Adverbialism and the Problem of Perception\n\nThe argument from illusion relies on the Phenomenal\nPrinciple. In rejecting this, the adverbialist thus rejects\nthe argument. But what about the argument from hallucination? This\ndoes not rely on the Phenomenal Principle. The adverbialist accepts\n(A). And they also accept (B) in the form of the Common Kind\nClaim. (C) follows (given assumptions (a1) and (a2)). For\nthis reason, the adverbialist must reject Direct Realist\nPresentation. So, like the sense-datum theorist, the\nadverbialist must admit that we are never directly presented with\nordinary objects, not even in veridical experience.\n3.2.5 Adverbialism and our Ordinary Conception of Perceptual Experience\n\nLike the sense-datum theorist, though the adverbialist accepts some of\nour ordinary conception of perceptual experience (the Common\nKind Claim), they reject other aspects of it. The argument\nfrom hallucination forces them to reject Direct Realist\nPresentation (and therefore Direct Realist\nCharacter). Underlying this is the adverbialist\u2019s\nrejection of Presentation, and arguably\nOrdinary Objects too. They reject\nPresentation in denying that experiences have a\nrelational structure. And given our discussion of Butchvarov\u2019s\nchallenge, it seems as though they must reject (or at least\ndon\u2019t have the resources to accept) Ordinary\nObjects. For it is unclear how they can validate the\nphenomenological claim that experiences are of objects, let alone\ndirectly of ordinary objects.\n\nSo, even though adverbialism arises as a response to the sense-datum\ntheory, given its almost wholesale rejection of our ordinary\nconception of perceptual experience, it is unclear how much of an\nimprovement the approach is in the broader dialectic of the Problem of\nPerception.\n3.2.6 Adverbialism and Perception of the World\n\nOne response to this is that we should not suppose that the only way\nto articulate direct realism is through the claim we\u2019ve labelled\nDirect Realist Presentation. There is another way to\narticulate it which, it might be suggested, enables the adverbialist\nto account for direct perception of the world. Consider, then:\n\nDirect Realist Presentation: perceptual\nexperiences are direct perceptual presentations of ordinary\nobjects.\n\n\nThis entails Direct Realism \u2013 that we can\ndirectly perceive ordinary objects \u2013 on the assumption that\nbeing directly perceptually presented with an ordinary object is a way\nof directly perceiving it. On this way of thinking, direct perception\nof an ordinary object is built into perceptual experience itself.\nHowever, one might reject this claim about experience (as\nadverbialists do), and still hold that we can have direct perception\nof an ordinary object. How?\n\nInstead of thinking of direct perception of the world as built\ninto experience, we can think of direct perception of the\nworld as built out of experience together with the\nsatisfaction of other conditions. This idea is usually developed\nthrough a causal theory of perception (Grice 1961): where\nperception of an object is analysed in terms of (i) experience of an\nordinary object (conceived as something which is not sufficient for\nperception), and (ii) the satisfaction of a causal condition which\nrequires that the experience be caused by the object (in a non-deviant\nway). This is a causal theory of direct perception on the\nassumption that the account doesn\u2019t involve any perceptual\nintermediaries.\n\nThe adverbialist might suggest that they can embrace this: by\ncombining their theory of experience with a causal analysis\nof direct perception. Thus, they can hold that when you have an\nexperience of a snow-covered churchyard, if this experience is\nappropriately caused by an ordinary white thing (e.g., some snow),\nthis is what directly perceiving such an object amounts to (given that\nno perceptual intermediaries are involved).\n\nHowever, whether the adverbialist is entitled to this way of making\nsense of direct perceptual contact with the world hinges on whether\nthey can make sense of the idea of an experience of an ordinary\nobject. But as we have seen in considering Butchvarov\u2019s\nchallenge, it is unclear whether the adverbialist can do this. It is\nthus unclear whether the adverbialist can really make sense of clause\n(i).\n\nIn response, the adverbialist might offer a causal analysis of\nexperiences being of objects. They might thus attempt to fall back on\nthe idea that an experience in which you sense whitely is an\nexperience \u201cof\u201d a white thing insofar as it is causally\nrelated to a white thing (or, insofar as it is of a type, instances of\nwhich are typically caused by white things). However, as Butchvarov\nargues, the fact that \u201cx is causally related to S\u2019s\nsensing in a certain way can no more reasonably be described as\nS\u2019s being conscious of [i.e. having a conscious experience of] x\nthan the fact that the presence of carbon monoxide in the air is\ncausally related to S\u2019s having a headache can be described as\nS\u2019s being conscious of [having a conscious experience of] carbon\nmonoxide\u201d (1980: 273).\n\nEven if the adverbialist is able to sustain such a causal\nform of direct realism, it is very different from the phenomenological\nform of direct realism embedded in our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience. It is thus unlikely to satisfy a direct realist\nsensitive to the phenomenological concerns which give rise to our\nordinary conception of perceptual experience.\n3.3 Intentionalism\n3.3.1 Intentionalism in Outline\n\nThe intentionalist holds that we directly experience ordinary objects.\nThe distinguishing feature of the view is a specific conception of the\nmanner in which experiences are directly of ordinary objects: here the\nintentionalist appeals to intentionality conceived of as a form of\nmental representation (hence it is also sometimes called the\nrepresentationalist theory of experience).\n\u201cIntentionality\u201d is a term with its origins in scholastic\nphilosophy (see Crane (1998b)), but its current use derives from\nBrentano (1874), who introduced the term \u201cintentional\ninexistence\u201d for the \u201cmind\u2019s direction upon its\nobjects\u201d. Intentional inexistence, or intentionality, is\nsometimes explained as the \u201caboutness\u201d of mental states\n(see the entries on\n Franz Brentano,\n representational theories of consciousness and\n intentionality).\n\nAt Level 1, then, the intentionalist holds that to experience a\nsnow-covered churchyard is to directly perceptually represent\nsuch an object (i.e. to represent such an object but not in virtue of\nrepresenting another more \u201cimmediate\u201d object). At Level 2,\nthis is put to work in explaining phenomenal character. In relation to\nour example, why is this a case of things appearing any way at all to\nyou, and why is it a case of things appearing white to you? Here the\nintentionalist appeals to the experience\u2019s directly representing\nthings in a certain way, and specifically to experience\u2019s\ndirectly representing whiteness in the environment, to account for\nthis. The character of your experience is explained by the specific\nway in which your experience directly represents the world.\n\nCritics of intentionalism have argued that it does not adequately\ndistinguish perceptual experience from other forms of intentionality,\nand therefore does not manage to capture what is distinctive about\nexperience (Robinson (1994: 164)). One objection of this kind is that\nthe aforementioned intentionalist explanation of character is\ninadequate. The worry is that believing that something is the case,\nfor example, or hoping that something is the case, are both forms of\nmental representation, but neither state of mind has any\n\u201cfeel\u201d or phenomenal character to call its own. (Words or\nimages may come to mind when mentally representing something in this\nway, but it is not obvious that these are essential to the states of\nmind themselves.) So, the challenge is that if there is nothing about\nrepresentation as such which explains the character of an experience,\nhow is experience supposed to be distinguished from mere thought?\n\nThere are a number of ways an intentionalist can respond. One is\nsimply to take it as a basic fact about perceptual intentionality that\nit has phenomenal character (see Kriegel (2013)). After all, even\nthose who believe in qualia have to accept that some states of mind\nhave qualia and some do not, and that at some point the distinction\nbetween mental states which are phenomenally conscious, and those\nwhich are not, just has to be accepted as a brute fact. Another\nresponse is to say that in order to fully explain the phenomenal\ncharacter of perceptual experience, we need to treat experience as\ninvolving non-intentional qualia as well as intentionality (see\nPeacocke (1983: Chapter 1); Shoemaker (1996); Block (1997)). There is,\naccordingly, a dispute between these intentionalists who accept qualia\n(like Block and Shoemaker) and those who don\u2019t (like Harman\n(1990) or Tye (1992)). (For more on this see the entries on\n qualia\n and\n inverted qualia.\n Additional readings are: Block (2005) (2010), Egan (2006), Hilbert\nand Kalderon (2000), Marcus (2006), Shoemaker (1990), Speaks (2015),\nSpener (2003), and Tye (2000)).\n\nIntentionalists endorse the Common Kind Claim. So, a\nveridical experience of churchyard covered in white snow, consists in\ndirect representation of such a scene, but so do corresponding\nillusory and hallucinatory experiences: these experiences have the\nsame nature.\n\nLike adverbialists, the intentionalist has no need to postulate\nnon-ordinary perceptible entities in the cases of illusion and\nhallucination. It is not generally true that when a representation\nrepresents something (as being F), there has to actually be something\n(which is F). Thus, for the intentionalist, experience is\nrepresentational in a way that contrasts with it being\nrelational/presentational. Experience does not genuinely have an\nact-object structure. This is in keeping with a standard tradition in\nthe theory of intentionality which treats it as non-relational (the\ntradition derives from Husserl (1900/1901); for discussion see Zahavi\n(2003: 13\u201327). So, for the intentionalist, since it is not of\nthe essence of experience or its character that it is relational, it\nis not of its essence that it is a relation to a sense-datum.\n3.3.2 Sources of Intentionalism\n\nSome of the most influential (at least partial) intentional theories\nare Anscombe (1965), Armstrong (1968), Pitcher (1970), Peacocke\n(1983), Harman (1990), Tye (1992, 1995), Dretske (1995), Lycan (1996);\nfor more recent accounts, see Byrne (2001), Siegel (2010), Pautz\n(2010) and the entry on\n the contents of perception.\n\nWithin analytic philosophy, intentionalism is a generalisation of an\nidea presented by G.E.M. Anscombe (1965), and the \u201cbelief\ntheories\u201d of D.M. Armstrong (1968) and George Pitcher (1970).\n(Within the phenomenological tradition intentionality and perception\nhad always been discussed together: see the entry on\n phenomenology.)\n Anscombe had drawn attention to the fact that perceptual verbs\nsatisfy the tests for non-extensionality or intensionality (see the\nentry on\n intensional transitive verbs).\n For example, just as \u2018Vladimir is thinking about Pegasus\u2019\nis an intensional context, so \u2018Vladimir has an experience as of\na pink elephant in the room\u2019 is an intensional context. In\nneither case can we infer that there exists something Vladimir is\nthinking about, or that there is exists something he is experiencing.\nThis is the typical manifestation of intensionality. Anscombe regarded\nthe error of sense-datum and naive realist theories as the failure to\nrecognise this intensionality. (Her own example was the alleged\nintensionality of \u2018see\u2019, but this is controversial.)\n\nArmstrong and Pitcher argued that perception is a form of belief.\n(More precisely, they argued that it is the acquisition of a belief,\nsince an acquisition is a conscious event, as perceiving is; rather\nthan a state or condition, as belief is.) Belief is an intentional\nstate in the sense that it represents the world to be a certain way,\nand the way it represents the world to be is said to be its\nintentional content. Perception, it was argued, is similarly a\nrepresentation of the world, and the way it represents the world to be\nis likewise its intentional content. The fact that someone can have a\nperceptual experience of something as F, without there being any thing\nwhich is F was taken as a reason for saying that perception is just a\nform of belief-acquisition.\n\nCertain cases put pressure on this. For instance, consider the famous\nM\u00fcller-Lyer illusion in which two lines of equal length look\nunequal. You can experience this even if you know (and therefore\nbelieve) that the lines are the same length. If perception were simply\nthe acquisition of belief, then this would be a case of explicitly\ncontradictory beliefs: you believe that the lines are the same length\nand that they are different lengths. But this is surely not the right\nway to describe this situation. (Armstrong recognized this, and\nre-described perception as a \u201cpotential belief\u201d; this\nmarks a significant retreat from the original claim).\n\nThe belief theory (and related theories, like the judgement theory of\nCraig (1976)) is a specific version of the intentional theory. But it\nis not the most widely accepted version (though see Gl\u00fcer (2009)\nfor a recent defence; and Byrne (forthcoming)). Intentionalism is,\nhowever, not committed to the view that perceptual experience is\nbelief; experience can be a sui generis kind of intentional\nstate or event (Martin (1993)).\n3.3.3 The Intentional Content of Perceptual Experience\n\nIntentionalists hold that what is in common between veridical\nexperiences and indistinguishable hallucinations/illusions is their\nintentional content: roughly speaking, how the world is\nrepresented as being by the experiences. Many intentionalists hold\nthat the sameness of phenomenal character in perception and\nhallucination/illusion is exhausted or constituted by this sameness in\ncontent (see Tye (2000), Byrne (2001)). But this latter claim is not\nessential to intentionalism (see the discussion of intentionalism and\nqualia above). What is essential is that the intentional content of\nperception explains (whether wholly or partly) its phenomenal\ncharacter.\n\nThe intentional content of perceptual experience is sometimes called\n\u201cperceptual content\u201d (see the entry on\n the contents of perception).\n What is perceptual content? A standard approach to intentionality\ntreats all intentional states as propositional attitudes: states which\nare ascribed by sentences of the form \u201cS ___ that p\u201d where\n\u2018S\u2019 is to be replaced by a term for a subject,\n\u2018p\u2019 with a sentence, and the \u2018___\u2019 with a\npsychological verb. The distinguishing feature of the propositional\nattitudes is that their content\u2014how they represent the world to\nbe\u2014is something which is assessable as true or false. Hence the\ncanonical form of ascriptions of perceptual experiences is: \u201cS\nperceives/experiences that p\u201d. Perceptual experience, on this\nkind of intentionalist view, is a propositional attitude (see Byrne\n(2001), Siegel (2010)).\n\nBut intentionalism is not committed to the view that experience is a\npropositional attitude. For one thing, it is controversial whether all\nintentional states are propositional attitudes (see Crane (2001:\nChapter 4)). Among the intentional phenomena there are relations like\nlove and hate which do not have propositional content; and there are\nalso non-relational states expressed by the so-called\n\u201cintensional transitive\u201d verbs like seek, fear, expect\n(see the entry on\n intensional transitive verbs).\n All these states of mind have contents which are not, on the face of\nit, assessable as true or false. If I am seeking a bottle of\ninexpensive Burgundy, what I am seeking\u2014the intentional content\nof my seeking, or the intentional object under a certain mode of\npresentation\u2014is not something true or false. Some argue that\nthese intentional relations and intentional transitives are analysable\nor reducible to propositional formulations (see Larson (2003) for an\nattempt to defend this view of intensional transitives; and Sainsbury\n(2010) for a less radical defence). But the matter is controversial;\nand it is especially controversial where experience is concerned. For\nwe have many ways of talking about experience which do not\ncharacterize its content in propositional terms: for example,\n\u201cVladimir sees a snail on the grass\u201d, or \u201cVladimir\nis watching a snail on the grass\u201d can be distinguished from the\npropositional formulation \u201cVladimir sees that there is a snail\non the grass\u201d (for discussion of watching, see Crowther\n2009).\n\nThere are those who follow Dretske (1969) in claiming that these\nsemantical distinctions express an important distinction between\n\u201cepistemic\u201d and \u201cnon-epistemic\u201d seeing.\nHowever, the view that perceptual content is non-propositional is not\nthe same as the view that it is \u201cnon-epistemic\u201d in\nDretske\u2019s sense. For ascriptions of non-epistemic seeing are\nintended to be fully extensional in their object positions, but not\nall non-propositional descriptions of perception need be (for example,\nsome have argued that \u201cMacbeth saw a dagger before him\u201d\ndoes not entail \u201cthere is a dagger which Macbeth saw\u201d: cf.\nAnscombe (1965)). The question of whether perceptual experience has a\npropositional content is far from being settled, even for those who\nthink it has intentional content (see McDowell (2008); Crane\n(2009)).\n\nAnother debate about the content of perceptual experience is whether\nit is object-dependent, or object-independent (see Soteriou (2000) and\nSchellenberg (2018: Part II); and for a more general discussion, see\nChalmers (2006)). An object-dependent content is a content which\nconcerns a particular object, and is such that it cannot be the\ncontent of a state of mind unless that object exists (McDowell (1987)\nand Brewer (1999)). An object-independent content is one whose ability\nto be the content of any intentional state is not dependent on the\nexistence of any particular object (Davies (1992) and McGinn\n(1989)).\n\nThe intentionalist holds that the content that is common to veridical\nexperiences and subjectively indistinguishable hallucinations is\nobject-independent: since such hallucinations occur in the absence of\nobjects for such content to depend upon. However, as Martin (2002b)\nargues, drawing on (Burge 1991), the intentionalist can still appeal\nto the idea that particular veridical experiences have\nparticular object-dependent contents in addition to the\nobject-independent contents they share with subjectively\nindistinguishable hallucinations.\n\nThe objects of intentional states are sometimes called\n\u201cintentional objects\u201d (Crane (2001: Chapter 1)). What are\nthe intentional objects of perceptual experience, according to\nintentionalists? In the case of veridical perception, the answer is\nsimple: ordinary objects like the churchyard, the snow etc. But what\nshould be said about the hallucinatory case? Since this case is by\ndefinition one in which there is no ordinary object being perceived,\nhow can we even talk about something being an \u201cobject of\nexperience\u201d here? As noted above, intentionalists say that\nexperiences are representations; and one can represent what does not\nexist (see Harman (1990), Tye (1992)). This is certainly true; but\nisn\u2019t there any more to be said? For how does a representation\nof a non-existent churchyard differ from a representation of a\nnon-existent cat, say, when one of those is hallucinated? The states\nseem to have different objects; but neither of these objects exist\n(see the entry\n nonexistent-objects).\n\nOne proposal is that the objects of hallucinatory experience are the\nproperties which the hallucinated object is presented as having\n(Johnston (2004)). Another answer is to say that these hallucinatory\nstates of mind have intentional objects which do not exist (Smith\n(2002: Chapter 9)). Intentional objects in this sense are not supposed\nto be entities or things of any kind. When we talk about perception\nand its \u201cobjects\u201d in this context, we mean the word in the\nway it occurs in the phrase \u201cobject of thought\u201d or\n\u201cobject of attention\u201d and not as it occurs in the phrase\n\u201cphysical object\u201d. An intentional object is always an\nobject for a subject, and this is not a way of classifying things in\nreality. An intentionalist need not be committed to intentional\nobjects in this sense; but if they are not, then they owe an account\nof the content of hallucinatory experiences.\n\nHow does the content of perceptual experience differ from the content\nof other intentional states? According to some intentionalists, one\nmain difference is that perception has \u201cnon-conceptual\u201d\ncontent. The basic idea is that experience involves a form of mental\nrepresentation which is in certain ways less sophisticated than the\nrepresentation involved in (say) belief. For example, having the\nbelief that the churchyard is covered in snow requires that you have\nthe concept of a churchyard. This is what it means to say that belief\nhas conceptual content: to have the belief with the content that a is\nF requires that you possess the concept a and the concept F. So, to\nsay that experience has non-conceptual content is to say the\nfollowing: for you to have an experience with the content that a is F\ndoes not require that you have the concept of a and the concept F. The\nidea is that your perceptual experience can represent the world as\nbeing a certain way\u2014the \u201ca is F\u201d way\u2014even if\nyou do not have the concepts that would be involved in believing that\na is F. (For a more detailed version of this definition, see Crane\n(1998a) and Cussins (1990); for a different way of understanding the\nidea of non-conceptual content, see Heck (2000) and Speaks (2005). The\nidea of non-conceptual content derives from Evans (1982); there are\nsome similar ideas in Dretske (1981); see Gunther (2002) for a\ncollection of articles on this subject. Other support for\nnon-conceptual content can be found in Berm\u00fadez (1997);\nPeacocke (1992); Crowther (2006); for opposition see Brewer (1999) and\nMcDowell (1994)).\n3.3.4 Intentionalism and the Problem of Perception\n\nThe intentionalist rejects the argument from illusion as it hinges on\nthe Phenomenal Principle which they reject. For the\nintentionalist, an illusory experience in which you see a white wall\nas yellow is not a case in which you are directly presented with a\nyellow sense-datum, but a case in which a white wall is directly\nrepresented as being yellow.\n\nHowever, the intentionalist must accept the argument from\nhallucination. They accept (A), and they also accept (B) in the form\nof the Common Kind Claim. (C) follows (given (a1) and\n(a2)). Thus, like sense-datum theorists and adverbialists,\nintentionalists reject Direct Realist Presentation,\nand admit that we are not ever directly presented with ordinary\nobjects, not even in veridical experience.\n3.3.5 Intentionalism and Perception of the World\n\nIn response to this, the intentionalist can suggest that although they\nreject Direct Realist Presentation, they do not\nreject Direct Realism. They can suggest that the\nformer is not the only way to understand the latter. As we saw above,\nanother way to understand Direct Realism is with a\ncausal understanding of direct perception.\n\nAs we noted above, it is unclear whether the adverbialist is\nentitled to this, since it is unclear how the adverbialist can make\nsense of the object-directedness of experience. But the intentionalist\ndoesn\u2019t face this problem. The object-directedness of experience\nis at the heart of their approach. Even though intentionalism denies\nthat experiences involve the direct presentation of ordinary objects,\nit (a) respects and is motivated by the phenomenological observation\nthat experiences are directly of ordinary objects, and (b) offers an\nalternative account of the manner in which experiences are directly of\nordinary objects. As we\u2019ve seen, instead of presentation, the\nintentionalist appeals to representation.\n\nThus, the intentionalist can maintain that when you see a snow-covered\nchurchyard for what it is you do directly perceive a\nsnow-covered churchyard. This is not because your experience\nitself directly presents you with a snow-covered churchyard. It\ndoesn\u2019t. After all, your experience is of such a kind that it\ncould occur in a hallucination, where it wouldn\u2019t directly\npresent any ordinary object. It is rather because your\nexperience directly perceptually represents the presence of a\nsnow-covered churchyard and is non-deviantly caused by the churchyard\nin question. This is what direct perception amounts to for the\nintentionalist\n3.3.6 Intentionalism and our Ordinary Conception of Perceptual Experience\n\nA concern about adverbialism that we raised above, from the\nperspective of one who wants to uphold our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience, is that (a) it rejects our ordinary conception\nof perceptual experience almost wholesale, and (b)\nadverbialist causal direct realism, even if it could be made to work,\ndoesn\u2019t seem to compensate for that: it isn\u2019t sensitive\nenough to the phenomenological concerns that motivate our ordinary\nconception of perceptual experience. In contrast, intentionalism seems\nto fare better on both scores. \n\nFirst, strictly speaking, the intentionalist must reject our ordinary\nconception of perceptual experience. Even though they accept the\nCommon Kind Claim, they reject Direct Realist\nPresentation. Underlying this is not rejection of\nOrdinary Objects but of\nPresentation. But even here, their rejection of\nPresentation is not too radical. For intentionalists can say that\nexperiences are quasi-presentational. The appeal to\nrepresentation enables this. For when you directly perceptually\nrepresent the snow-covered churchyard, it certainly seems to you as if\na churchyard is directly present to you, even if it is not (as you\nare, say, hallucinating). As we noted above, it is not clear from the\nresources the adverbialist offers how they can account for how it even\nseems as if an object is present to you. How does perceiving\nwhitely make it seem as if a white thing is present to you?\n\nSimilarly, though strictly speaking the intentionalist must reject\nDirect Realist Character, the departure from this is\nnot too radical. For instead, the intentionalist holds that the\ncharacter of experience is determined, at least partly, by the direct\nperceptual representation of ordinary objects. It is not as if\nordinary objects and their apparent presence drops out of the picture\non the intentionalist account of phenomenal character. The account is\nsimilar to Direct Realist Character, just stripped of\nthe genuine relationality.\n\nFinally, the causal direct realist story that the intentionalist\noffers is intelligible in the way that it arguably isn\u2019t for the\nadverbialist. And although it invokes causal notions, this is not to\nthe exclusion of a core phenomenological understanding of\ndirect experience of an object, which the intentionalist accounts for\nwith the notion of direct perceptual representation. \n\nIntentionalism, then, is a Direct Realist theory\nwhich upholds some of our ordinary conception of perceptual\nexperience, and insofar as it rejects aspects of our ordinary\nconception, it does so in a non-radical way, sensitive to the\nphenomenological concerns that motivate this conception in the first\nplace.\n3.4 Naive Realist Disjunctivism\n3.4.1 Naive Realism in Outline\n\nConsider the veridical experiences involved in cases where you\ngenuinely perceive objects as they actually are. At Level 1, naive\nrealists hold that such experiences are, at least in part, direct\npresentations of ordinary objects. At Level 2, the naive realist holds\nthat things appear a certain way to you because you are directly\npresented with aspects of the world, and \u2013 in the case we are\nfocusing on \u2013 things appear white to you, because you are\ndirectly presented with some white snow. The character of your\nexperience is explained by an actual instance of whiteness manifesting\nitself in experience.\n\nNaive realists thus assign an important explanatory role to the world\nitself in explaining the character of veridical experiences. But this\ndoesn\u2019t mean that they are committed to the idea that such\ncharacter is fully explained or exhausted by the presented\nworld. Naive realists admit that even holding fixed presented aspects\nof the world there can be variation in the character of experience.\nThis is worked out in different (but compatible) ways by different\ntheorists. One approach is to note how variations in the\nperceiver can make for variations in the character of\nexperience (Logue (2012a)). Another is to highlight a\nthird-relatum (of the relation of presentation) which\nencapsulates various conditions of perception such as one\u2019s\nspatiotemporal perspective and the operative perceptual modality,\nwhere variation in such conditions can make for variation in\nphenomenal character (Campbell (2009), Brewer (2011)). Finally, some\nsuggest that there can be variation in the way or\nmanner in which one is related to perceived objects which\nmakes a difference to phenomenal character (Soteriou (2013), Campbell\n(2014), French and Phillips (2020)). For further discussion see French\n(2018).\n\nFor the naive realist, insofar as experience and experiential\ncharacter is constituted by a direct perceptual relation to aspects of\nthe world, it is not constituted by the representation of such aspects\nof the world. This is why many naive realists describe the relation at\nthe heart of their view as a non-representational relation.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that experiences must lack intentional\ncontent, but it means that (a) insofar as appeal is made to\npresentation to explain character, no appeal is made to intentional\ncontent for that purpose, and (b) what is fundamental to experience is\nsomething which itself cannot be explained in terms of representing\nthe world: a primitive relation of presentation. (For further\ndiscussion of naive realism as a non-representational view, see the\narticles in Part Three of Brogaard (2014)).\n\nThe other theories we have considered all endorse the Common\nKind Claim. We\u2019ve noted that naive realism applies to\nthe veridical experiences involved in genuine perception, but does it\napply more widely? Though naive realists may extend their approach to\nillusions, they typically deny that it applies to hallucinations and\nso reject the Common Kind Claim. Naive realists who\ndeny the Common Kind Claim are\ndisjunctivists. We call such a position naive realist\ndisjunctivism. Let\u2019s explore these ideas now.\n3.4.2 Naive Realism and the Problem of Perception\n\nThere are various different naive realist approaches to illusion (see\ne.g., Fish (2009: Chapter 6), Brewer (2008, 2011: Chapter 5), Kalderon\n(2011), Genone (2014), French and Phillips (2020)). When it comes to\nthe argument from illusion, the naive realist (like the\nintentionalist) rejects the Phenomenal Principle. So\nhow does naive realism differ from intentionalism about illusions? In\ntwo respects: first, naive realists can maintain that illusory\nexperiences are fundamentally direct presentations of the\nworld. Second, the naive realist can explain the character of such\nillusory experiences without appeal to intentional content, but\ninstead by appealing to the direct presentation of ordinary objects.\nConsider, for example, the approach developed by Brewer:\n\n\nvisually relevant similarities are those that ground and explain the\nways that the particular physical objects that we are acquainted with\nin perception look. That is to say, visually relevant similarities are\nsimilarities by the lights of visual processing of various kinds...\nvery crudely, visually relevant similarities are identities in such\nthings as the way in which light is reflected and transmitted from the\nobjects in question, and the way in which the stimuli are handled by\nthe visual system, given its evolutionary history and our shared\ntraining during development (2011: 103)... in a case of visual\nillusion in which a mind-independent physical object, o, looks F,\nalthough o is not actually F, o is the direct object of visual\nperception from a spatiotemporal point of view and in circumstances of\nperception relative to which o has visually relevant similarities with\nparadigm exemplars of F although it is not actually an instance of F\n(2011: 105).\n\n\nSo though o may not itself be F, it can exist in certain conditions,\nC, such that it has visually relevant similarities to paradigm F\nthings and in that sense it will objectively look F, or look like an F\nthing\u2014that is, it will itself have a property, a look or an\nappearance, independently of anyone actually seeing it (see also\nMartin (2010), Kalderon (2011), Antony (2011), and Genone (2014) on\nobjective looks). If o is then seen in C, o itself will look F to\nyou in perception. Brewer spells this all out in more detail,\nand with various examples. One is seeing a white piece of chalk as\nred. The chalk is seen in abnormal illumination conditions such that\nthe white piece of chalk itself looks like a paradigm red piece of\nchalk\u2014it has \u201cvisually relevant similarities with a\nparadigm piece of chalk, of just that size and shape\u201d (2011:\n106). Given that it is seen in those conditions, it looks red to you,\neven though it is not in fact red. Here, then, we have an account of\nillusions in which we appeal to objects and the ways those objects\nare, not the ways they are represented to be, in explaining\ncharacter.\n\nWhat about the argument from hallucination? The naive realist thinks\nthat at least veridical experiences are direct presentations of\nordinary objects. They thus reject the conclusion (C) of the argument.\nBut typically, naive realists accept (A). They therefore block the\nargument by rejecting the spreading step (B), understood in terms of\nthe Common Kind Claim applied to veridical and\nhallucinatory experiences.\n\nSuch a naive realist reasons as follows: suppose that when you see a\nsnow-covered churchyard for what it is, you have an experience which\nis in its nature a relation between you and ordinary objects. But a\nsubjectively indistinguishable hallucinatory experience does not have\nsuch a nature. For such a hallucination could occur in the absence of\nany relevant worldly items (e.g., in the lab of a scientist\nmanipulating your brain, in a world with no white things). Instead of\ntaking (B) and these facts about hallucination to ground the rejection\nof naive realism, the naive realist instead rejects (B): even though\nthe hallucination as of a snow-covered churchyard is subjectively\nindistinguishable from a veridical experience of such a scene, it is\nnot of the same fundamental kind. (For a more nuanced formulation of\nthe naive realist reasoning here, see Martin (2004), (2006). Raleigh\n(2014) and Ali (2018) advocate a na\u00efve realist position which\nkeeps the Common Kind Claim but rejects (A) and hence\nthe understanding of hallucinations we are operating with here. See\nalso Masrour (2020) who argues that it is an open question whether\nhallucinations are possible.).\n\nIn blocking the argument from hallucination in this way the naive\nrealist endorses disjunctivism. This theory was first\nproposed by Hinton (1973) and was later developed by P.F. Snowdon\n(1979, 1990), John McDowell (1982, 1987) and M.G.F. Martin (2002,\n2004, 2006). Disjunctivism is not best construed as it is by one of\nits proponents, as the view \u201cthat there is nothing literally in\ncommon\u201d in veridical perception and hallucination, \u201cno\nidentical quality\u201d (Putnam (1999: 152)). For both the veridical\nperception of an F and a subjectively indistinguishable hallucination\nof an F are experiences which are subjectively indistinguishable from\na veridical perception of an F. What disjunctivists deny is that what\nmakes it true that these two experiences are describable in\nthis way is the presence of the same fundamental kind of mental state.\nDisjunctivists reject what J.M. Hinton calls \u201cthe doctrine of\nthe \u2018experience\u2019 as the common element in a given\nperception\u201d and an indistinguishable hallucination (Hinton\n(1973: 71)). The most fundamental common description of both states,\nthen, is a merely disjunctive one: the experience is either a genuine\nperception of an F or a mere hallucination as of an F. Hence the\ntheory\u2019s name.\n3.4.3 The Development of Naive Realist Disjunctivism\n\nThe disjunctivist rejects the Common Kind Claim.\nUnderlying this is a rejection of what Martin (2004, 2006) calls the\n\u201ccommon kind assumption\u201d, namely:\n\n(CKA) whatever fundamental kind of mental event\noccurs when you veridically perceive, the very same kind of event\ncould occur were you undergoing a subjectively indistinguishable\nhallucination.\n\n\nBut is the disjunctivist\u2019s rejection of (CKA)\nplausible? The disjunctivist can note how the fact that a\nhallucination is subjectively indistinguishable from a veridical\nexperience does not entail that they are of the same\nfundamental kind, even if it does suggest this. \n\nHowever, some argue that even if such an appeal to subjective\nindistinguishability is not enough to establish\n(CKA), it is nonetheless well supported by a\ncausal argument (Robinson (1985)). We can suppose that when\nyou see the snow-covered churchyard for what it is, there is some\nproximal cause of this experience: the experience is preceded by a\ncertain sort of brain state B. But now we can imagine a situation in\nwhich we bring about B thus producing an experience in you, yet where\nB is not brought about through any interaction between you and a\nsnow-covered churchyard\u2014e.g., in laboratory conditions. In this\nscenario you have an hallucinatory experience as of a snow-covered\nchurchyard. It is plausible to suppose that these experiences are of\nthe very same kind given that they have the same proximal cause.\n\nThe point here is that (CKA) looks like a plausible\nprinciple for causally matching veridical and hallucinatory\nexperiences \u2013 veridical and hallucinatory experiences with the\nsame proximal cause. This way of motivating (CKA)\nappeals to a same-cause, same-effect principle:\n\nCausal Principle 1: an event e1 is of the same kind as an event e2\nif event e1 is produced by the same kind of proximate causal condition\nas e2 (Nudds 2009: 336).\n\n\nIs this the end of the road for the naive realist disjunctivist, then?\nNot quite, since as Martin argues, the naive realist should reject\nthis principle:\n\n\nOn [the naive realist] conception of experience, when one is\nveridically perceiving the objects of perception are constituents of\nthe experiential episode. The given event could not have occurred\nwithout these entities existing and being constituents of it; in turn,\none could not have had such a kind of event without there being\nrelevant candidate objects of perception to be apprehended. So, even\nif those objects are implicated in the causes of the experience, they\nalso figure non-causally as essential constituents of it... Mere\npresence of a candidate object will not be sufficient for the\nperceiving of it, that is true, but its absence is sufficient for the\nnon-occurrence of such an event. The connection here is [one] of a\nconstitutive or essential condition of a kind of event. (2004:\n56\u201357).\n\n\nMartin\u2019s point is that the naive realist may well admit the\npossibility of veridical experiences and causally matching\nhallucinations, but they will resist the idea that sameness of\nproximal cause implies sameness of the kind of experience involved.\nThis is because there are non-causal constitutive conditions\nfor the occurrence of the veridical experience which are not satisfied\nin the hallucinatory case.\n\nHowever, Martin suggests that the arguer from hallucination can\ndevelop their case against naive realism further. This development\ninvolves an argument with two stages. First, a modified causal\nargument: the reverse causal argument, and second the\nscreening-off problem. \n\nThe modified causal argument involves a modified causal principle:\n\nCausal Principle 2: an event e1 is of the same kind K as an event\ne2 if event e1 is produced by the same kind of proximate causal\ncondition as e2 in circumstances that do not differ in any non-causal\nconditions necessary for the occurrence of an event of kind K (Nudds\n2009: 337).\n\n\n(Martin\u2019s own modified causal principle is more complicated than\nthis in allowing for indeterministic causation. We gloss over this\nimportant complication here). Take N to be the fundamental kind which\ncharacterizes a veridical experience of a snow-covered churchyard,\naccording to the naive realist. Does Causal Principle 2 allow us to\nsay that N is present in the causally matching hallucinatory case, as\n(CKA) predicts? No. For the hallucination is produced\nin circumstances that differ in non-causal conditions necessary for\nthe occurrence of N given how the naive realist understands\nN: in the circumstances in which the hallucination occurs there\nis no appropriate object of perception, but the presence of such an\nobject is necessary for the occurrence of N.\n\nSo how does Causal Principle 2 help the arguer from hallucination? We\nhave to run an argument in \u201cthe reverse direction, from what\nmust be true of cases of causally matching hallucinations, to what\nmust thereby be true of the veridical perceptions they match\u201d\n(Martin 2006: 368). That is, take a hallucination as of a snow-covered\nchurchyard h, and suppose that h is of some fundamental kind H. Now we\ncan apply Causal Principle 2 to show that H is present in a causally\nmatching veridical experience of a snow-covered churchyard,\nv. For now v is produced by the same kind of proximal cause in\ncircumstances where there is no difference in the non-causal\nconditions necessary for the occurrence of an event of kind H. This is\nbecause all that is necessary for an occurrence of H is some brain\ncondition, which is present in the circumstances in which v is brought\nabout. This reverse causal argument does not show that v is not of\nfundamental kind N. What it does show, however, is that whatever\nfundamental kind is present in a hallucinatory case will also be\npresent in a causally matching veridical case. So even if v is\nfundamentally N it is also H. That is, we have the Reverse Common Kind\nAssumption:\n\n(RCKA) Whatever fundamental kind of event occurs\nwhen you hallucinate, the very same kind of event also occurs in a\ncausally matching veridical experience.\n\n\nBut now we run into the screening-off problem. There is\nsomething it is like for you to have an hallucinatory experience as of\na snow-covered churchyard, and the experience seems to relate you to a\nsnow-covered churchyard. This fact about the hallucinatory experience\nis grounded in its being of kind H. But now if an experience of that\nkind is present in the veridical case, it is difficult to see how what\nthe naive realist says is fundamental to that case, N, is doing\nanything by way of explaining what it is like for a subject to have\nthe experience. The presence of H in the veridical case seems to make\nN explanatorily redundant, or \u201cscreen off\u201d N\u2019s\nexplanatory role, contra the ambitions of naive realism. (For more\ndetailed expositions of this two-stage argument see Martin (2004),\nByrne and Logue, (2008), Hellie (2013) and Soteriou (2014: Chapter\n6)).\n\nThe most widely discussed naive realist response to this argument is\nthat of Martin (2004, 2006). Though there are now a range of different\nnaive realist responses available, some of which integrate critical\ndiscussion of Martin\u2019s own approach (see Allen (2015), Logue\n(2012b, 2013), Fish (2009: Chapter 4), Hellie (2013), Moran (2019),\nSethi (2020)).\n\nMartin argues that the screening-off stage of the argument is only\nproblematic if we accept a positive, non-derivative account of\ncausally matching hallucinations. On such an account, hallucinations\nhave a positive nature which doesn\u2019t derive from that of\nveridical perception: a nature that can be specified independently of\nany reference to veridical perception. For instance, hallucinations\nare direct presentations of sense-data, or representations of ordinary\nobjects. Instead, Martin suggests, the disjunctivist should conceive\nof causally matching hallucinations in a purely negative epistemic\nway: such a hallucination as of an F is a state of mind which is not\nintrospectively knowably not a veridical perception of an F. What\nmakes it the case that your hallucinatory experience is as of a\nsnow-covered churchyard, with a certain sort of phenomenal character,\nis just that it is an occurrence which cannot be discriminated, by\nintrospection alone, from a veridical perception of a snow-covered\nchurchyard. The particular subjective perspective that a hallucinator\nhas in a causally matching hallucination as of a snow-covered\nchurchyard is explained just by the obtaining of this negative\nepistemic condition, not by anything more positive such as a relation\nto a white sense-datum or the representation of white snow (c.f.,\nDancy (1995: 425)). On such a view, causally matching hallucinations\nare derivative: specifying their nature requires essential reference\nto the basic case of veridical perception.\n\nIf we accept Martin\u2019s account of causally matching\nhallucinations, then we can see how H can be present in both the\nhallucinatory and the veridical case: since trivially a veridical\nexperience of a snow-covered churchyard is indiscriminable from a\nveridical experience of a snow-covered churchyard. But what about\nscreening off? Does H have a nature which means that the presence of H\nin the veridical case threatens the explanatory power of N? It\ndoesn\u2019t, Martin argues, since H\u2019s explanatory force is\nderivative or dependent: it is parasitic on that of N. As Martin notes\nwith his own example:\n\n\nBut if that is so [if H screens off the explanatory role of N], then\nthe property of being a veridical perception of a tree [i.e. N] never\nhas an explanatory role, since it is never instantiated without the\nproperty of being indiscriminable from such a perception being\ninstantiated as well. But if the property of being a veridical\nperception lacks any explanatory role, then we can no longer show that\nbeing indiscriminable from a veridical perception has the explanatory\nproperties which would screen off the property of being a veridical\nperception (2004: 69).\n\n\nHere, then, is a summary of this complex dialectic: the argument\nfrom hallucination seems to disprove naive realism, but the naive\nrealist appeals to disjunctivism in response. However, the\ncausal argument puts pressure on disjunctivism, by supporting\nthe common kind assumption. In response, the naive realist\nrejects the key principle of this argument (Causal Principle 1). But\nthen a two-stage argument consisting of the reverse causal\nargument and the screening-off problem attempts to show\nthat: (1) the fundamental kind of experience present in hallucination\nis also present in causally matching veridical experience, and (2)\nthis undermines the naive realist idea that the character of veridical\nexperience is shaped by the directly presented world. In response,\nMartin accepts a form of naive realism which embraces disjunctivism\n(in the form of the claim that causally matching veridical and\nhallucinatory experiences are fundamentally different). But which also\naccepts (as per the reverse causal argument) that there is a common\nelement across the cases, for the hallucinatory kind is present in\nveridical cases too. But since he conceives of this common element in\na derivative, and purely negative epistemic way, he blocks the\nargument at the second stage, rejecting screening off.\n\nNaturally, then, much subsequent critical discussion has focused on\nMartin\u2019s negative epistemic conception of hallucination. Further\ndiscussion and development of Martin\u2019s approach is to be found\nin Nudds (2009, 2013) and Soteriou (2014: Chapter 6). For criticism of\nMartin\u2019s approach see Hawthorne and Kovakovich (2006), Farkas\n(2006), Sturgeon (2008), Siegel (2004, 2008), and Robinson (2013). See\nBurge (2005) for a general and polemical attack on disjunctivism. For\nmore on disjunctivism, see Haddock and Macpherson (eds.) (2008), Byrne\nand Logue (eds.) (2009), Macpherson and Platchias (eds.) (2013) and\nthe entry on\n the disjunctive theory of perception.\n3.4.4 Naive Realist Disjunctivism and Our Ordinary Conception of Perceptual Experience\n\nAccording to naive realist disjunctivists, at least veridical\nexperiences are directly of ordinary objects (Ordinary\nObjects), and are direct presentations of their objects\n(Presentation). Naive realist disjunctivists thus\nmaintain Direct Realist Presentation, and hence\nDirect Realism for at least veridical experiences\n\u2013 indeed they maintain Direct Realism without\nthe need for any appeal to a causal theory of direct perception.\nFurther, naive realist disjunctivists hold that the phenomenal\ncharacter of such experiences is determined, at least in part, by the\ndirect presentation of ordinary objects (Direct Realist\nCharacter). The only aspect of our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience which naive realist disjunctivists reject\noutright is the Common Kind Claim.\n4. Conclusion\n\nSense-datum theorists and adverbialists depart substantially from our\nordinary conception of perceptual experience. Advocates of each view\nwill argue, in their different ways, that this is a consequence of\nresponding adequately to the Problem of Perception. \n\nIntentionalists and naive realist disjunctivists disagree, and argue,\nin different ways, that we can respond to the Problem of Perception\nwithout departing substantially from our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience: by maintaining Direct Realism\nin some form, and maintaining or at least being sensitive to many of\nthe specific phenomenological components of our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience.\n\n\nWhilst the debate between sense-datum theorists and adverbialists (and\nbetween these and other theories) is not as prominent as it once was,\nthe debate between intentionalists and naive realist disjunctivists is\na significant ongoing debate in the philosophy of perception: a legacy\nof the Problem of Perception that is arguably \u201cthe greatest\nchasm\u201d in the philosophy of perception (Crane (2006)). The\nquestion, now, is not so much whether to be a direct realist,\nbut how to be one.\n",

Useful collections: Swartz (1965), Dancy (1988),\nNo\u00eb and Thompson (2002), Gendler and Hawthorne (2006), Haddock\nand Macpherson (2008), Byrne and Logue (2009), Nanay (2010), and\nBrogaard (2014). Matilal (1986) explores how issues around the Problem\nof Perception and theories of experience play out in Classical Indian\nphilosophy.</p>\n<p>\nFor discussion of how the problem of perception, somewhat differently\nconstrued, arises in the senses other than vision, see Perkins (1983).\nThere is much literature on non-visual perception, not all of it\naddressing the problem of perception, but much of it will be relevant\nto considering the problem of perception in non-visual modalities: on\nsounds, see Nudds (2001), O\u2019Callaghan (2007), Nudds and\nO\u2019Callaghan (2009); on smell, see Batty (2011), Richardson\n(2013a, 2013b); on touch, see O\u2019Shaughnessy (1989), Martin\n(1992) and Fulkerson (2014); for the senses in general, see Nudds\n(2003), Macpherson (2011, 2011a) and Stokes, Matthen, and Briggs\n(2015)). On multisensory perception, see O\u2019Callaghan (2019).</p>\n</div>"
