    "main_text": "Language and Psychology || Dispositional Theory of Meaning\n3.2 Dispositional Theory of Meaning\n\nStevenson\u2019s solution to this problem of flux is to provide a\ndispositional theory of meaning grounded in the causal-historical\nrelations between a sign and the psychological states of those within\na linguistic community who have used and reacted to, and continue to\nuse and react to, the sign. For Stevenson, a sign\u2019s meaning is not\nconstituted by its use on an occasion of utterance. Rather, a sign\u2019s\nmeaning is constituted by its power\u2014its\n\u201ctendency,\u201d \u201cpotentiality,\u201d \u201clatent\nability,\u201d or \u201cdisposition\u201d (1937, 20\u201322; 1944,\n46; 1948a, 158)\u2014to evoke the psychological states of a hearer or\nto express those of a speaker. The power of an expression, like the\npurchasing power of a dollar, or the stimulating power of coffee, is\nto be understood as a complex network of causal relations:\n\n\nThe word \u2018disposition\u2019 \u2026, is useful in dealing with\ncomplicated causal situations, where some specified sort of\nevent is a function of many variables. To illustrate \u2026 Although\ncoffee often \u2018causes\u2019 stimulation, it is never the only\ncause. The degree of stimulation will depend as well on many other\nfactors\u2014the initial state of a man\u2019s fatigue, the absorptive\nstate of his stomach, the constitution of his nervous system, and so\non. (1944, 46)\n\n\nJust as the stimulating power of coffee remains relatively unchanged\ndespite varied reactions or responses to the ingestion of coffee, so\ntoo does the meaning of an expression remain relatively unchanged\ndespite varied psychological states resulting from or leading to the\narticulation of an expression (1944, 46\u201347).\n\nThe stimulating power of coffee, for instance, is a disposition\nconstituted by a complex causal network consisting of: (i)\nstimuli, such as the variable amounts of coffee ingested; and\n(ii) responses, such as the resulting changes in energy,\nattention, anxiety, or irritation. These stimuli and responses are\nmediated by: (iii) attendant circumstances, such as a\ndrinker\u2019s fatigue at the time of ingestion, the absorptive rate of\ntheir stomach, or the constitution of their nervous system; and\n(iv) the basis of the disposition, such as the chemical\ncomposition of the coffee or the soil conditions where it was grown.\nThe responses, then, are a function of the stimuli, attendant\ncircumstances, and basis, and one who specifies these and who\nspecifies in detail their correlation \u201chas said all about the\ndisposition that there is to say\u201d (1944, 51).\n\nThe meaning of a term is the \u201cconjunction\u201d or union of two\ndispositions, one \u201cactive\u201d disposition to evoke\npsychological states of a hearer, another \u201cpassive\u201d\ndisposition to be used to express the psychological states of a\nspeaker, where a disposition is a complex causal network of stimuli\n(e.g., an utterance, in the case of a sign\u2019s active disposition, or a\nmental state, in the case of a passive one), responses (e.g., a\nbelief, in the case of an active disposition, or an utterance, in the\ncase of a passive one), attendant circumstances (e.g., the context of\nutterance), and basis (perhaps the sign\u2019s history of use within a\nlinguistic community) (1944, 57\u201358). Stevenson warns that his\naccount of meaning, understood in causal-dispositional terms, should\nnot be taken as anything close to a complete theory of meaning, but\nonly as \u201chalf analysis, half analogy,\u201d \u201ca device for\npointing to\u201d one that must be extraordinarily complex (1944,\n58).\n",
