    "main_text": "Principles and Theories || Public Reflective Equilibrium\n2.5 Public Reflective Equilibrium\n\nThe mainstream reflective equilibrium of the early Rawls and Daniels\nis individualist. It is a method for a philosopher to work\nout her views (Rawls 1971; Daniels 1996). Further, they claim it is a\nmethod that makes those views reasonable or justified. Yet it might be\nclaimed that a single philosopher\u2019s views on a topic of public\ninterest, such as Rawls\u2019 and Daniels\u2019 main substantive\ntopic of social justice, cannot really be justified in that way. That\nindividual may have justified their view to themselves, but they have\nnot justified it to other people, who have different considered\njudgments and find different principles and theories appealing.\n\nOne response here is to insist that, if you have followed the method\ncorrectly, it does justify one\u2019s principles, and not only to\noneself (see the discussions of credibility and relativism below). It\nmight nevertheless be urged that, if our views are to have some impact\nin the real world, they should move other people as well as ourselves\n(Anderson 2015). This is a challenge to reflective equilibrium from\npolitical practice rather than moral epistemology, and philosophers\nmay feel it is not their role to address it\u2014it is enough for\nthem to set out justified views. Still, those with policy ambitions\nfor reflective equilibrium have described three broad forms of\npublic reflective equilibrium.\n\nThe first keeps individualist reflective equilibrium as its starting\npoint, but aims to achieve convergence between equilibria (Daniels\n1996: 33\u201339). The later Rawls particularly appeals to the idea\nof an \u201coverlapping consensus\u201d (Rawls 2005). The broad\nmotivation here is that in a plural society with a diversity of\ncomprehensive moral doctrines we cannot rely on any one comprehensive\ndoctrine, such as utilitarianism, Kantianism, or a specific religious\nfaith, to support our political principles. Rather, the reflective\nequilibria of adherents of each of these comprehensive doctrines can\nconverge on a specific set of liberal principles, each for different\nreasons. The later Rawls continues to assume that reflective\nequilibria are wide, but now maintains that they should be\ngeneral: \u201cthe same conception is affirmed in\neveryone\u2019s considered judgments\u201d (Rawls 2005: 384 n. 16).\nHe refers to wide and general reflective equilibrium as full\nreflective equilibrium.\n\nAn alternative form of public reflective equilibrium appears to reject\nindividualism even as a starting point, drawing on empirical work to\nform judgments and principles. One version of this approach is\nquantitative, drawing on survey data (Savulescu et al. 2021). Another\nversion is qualitative, using interviews or \u201csemi-structured\ndiscussions\u201d (Wolff & de Shalit 2007: 11). For instance, in\na study on social disadvantage, the researchers\n\n\nconsulted our interviewees about our views and we learnt from them. In\nthis process we revised and modified our theory according to the\ntheories and intuitions expressed by the interviewees. (Wolff & de\nShalit 2007: 12)\n\n\nThe specific topic might make particular interviewees\nappropriate\u2014in the disadvantage case, those that provide\nservices to the disadvantaged as well as disadvantaged people\nthemselves\u2014or more informal selection methods may be used:\n\n\nIf possible, the decision with whom to talk should be done by\nstrolling in different parts of the city, bumping into people every\nnow and then, and asking them to enter into a discussion. (de Shalit\n2020: 19)\n\n\nA difficulty with this approach is that it may be too ambitious in its\nexpectations of the general public\u2019s theorizing, as it takes not\nonly judgments but theories from consultees. Yet the general public\nmay not have moral and political principles, if they do have such\nprinciples they may conflict, and their views certainly do not mirror\ntheoretical divides in philosophy (e.g., between Kantians and\nutilitarians) (Baderin 2017: 11\u201312).\n\nThis may motivate a final form of public reflective equilibrium, which\nuses the public\u2019s judgments but not their theories, and in\nparticular their case-specific judgments (Baderin 2017; see also\nMiller 1999). The merit of using the public\u2019s judgments is that\nthey are independent of principles, which might be considered\nan essential requirement if a meaningful balance is to be struck\nbetween judgments and principles, but one which can hardly be met by\nphilosophers\u2019 judgments (Baderin 2017: 15\u201319). The point\nis similar to Elgin\u2019s reason for giving priority to initial\njudgments\u2014principles can enslave as well as enlighten. The\nphilosopher remains the one undergoing reflective equilibrium, and is\nfree to reject the public\u2019s judgments, but a persistent refusal\nto adapt theory to public judgment suggests a refusal to earnestly\nengage in reflective equilibrium (Baderin 2017: 19\u201320). Among\nchallenges for such a view are the lack of mutual adjustment\nof judgments and principles where judgments are the public\u2019s\nrather than the individual\u2019s.\n",
