New\nreflections on the embryological origin of the individual organism in\nthe seventeenth-century provided a particular point of focus, and the\nreflections on this issue were closely tied to speculations about\nspecies origins.\n\nIn its seventeenth-century context, the issue of species origins also\ninvolved debates over the possibility of the spontaneous generation of\nforms (Roger 1963 [1997: chp. 2]). The apparent experimental\nrefutations by Francesco Redi (1626\u20131667) of spontaneous\ngeneration theory weakened, but did not destroy the foundations of\nBurnet\u2019s theory. Evidence for spontaneous generation could\nalways be explained by appeal to Augustine\u2019s theory of the pre-\nexistent \u201cseeds\u201d or \u201cgerms\u201d.\n\nThe extensive empirical researches on the generation and embryological\nformation of birds and mammals carried out by William Harvey\n(1578\u20131657), and published late in his life in his\nExercitationes de generatione animalium (Observations on\nthe Generation of Animals) in 1651 (Harvey 1651 [1847]), proved\nto be a bombshell in this discussion. Harvey\u2019s careful studies\nclaimed to refute on empirical grounds both the Aristotelian\nform-matter theory of sexual generation as well as the rival\n\u201ctwo-seeds\u201d theory based on the assumption of equivalent\nmale and female semen. This latter theory had been embraced by ancient\natomists, by Galenic and Hippocratic medical theorists, and by the\nmajority of Renaissance physicians. The two-seeds theory had also been\naccepted by early-modern atomists such as Pierre Gassendi\n(1592\u20131655) and Nathaniel Highmore (1613\u201385) (Fisher\n2006). As a consequence, when Descartes\u2019s own speculations on\nembryonic formation were finally published posthumously in 1677, in\nwhich he had also relied on the combination of male and female\nsemina organized by laws of nature and the vortex theory,\nthey commonly met with derision (see quote from Garden below).\nHarvey\u2019s detailed embryological enquiries of 1651 had already\nseriously undermined the empirical bases of these claims. It is\ndifficult to find any author who endorsed the solution as offered by\nDescartes.\n\nThese empirical difficulties with both the main inherited theories of\ngeneration as well as with the new \u201cmechanistic\u201d\nalternative accounts of embryogenesis of Gassendi, Highmore, and\nDescartes produced a conceptual crisis within the program of universal\nmechanism that suggested that universal mechanism could not deal\ncausally with one of the most important issues in the philosophy of\nnature. Another solution needed to be found.\n\nAs a consequence of the failure of \u201cmechanistic\u201d\nepigenesis, post- Cartesian mechanists resolved this issue with the\ntheory of \u201cpreexistence\u201d. Scientific foundations of this\ncan be traced to the work of the microscopist Jan Swammerdam\n(1637\u201380) in the late 1660s on the basis of his microscopic\nobservations on developing insects. The philosophical development of\nthis theory was made by the French Oratorian priest Nicholas\nMalebranche (1638\u20131715), whose influential Recherche de la\nv\u00e9rit\u00e9 of 1674 recast many Cartesian principles\ninto a framework of \u201ctheistic\u201d universal mechanism\n(Malebranche 1674; Gaukroger 2010: chp.2). In this work Malebranche\noffered a novel theory of generation which is most accurately termed a\n\u201cpreexistence\u201d theory. On this view, the new organism is\nnot generated in secular time, but has pre-existed since the original\ncreation of the world. This theory, often supported by appeals to\nAugustine\u2019s theory of the creation of original seeds (see above\nSection 1.2), was to become the paradigmatic theory for nearly a\ncentury, and was closely associated with some version of the\nmechanical philosophy. Various expressions of the preexistence theory\ncan be traced into the public teaching and published works of such\ninfluential expositors of academic medicine as Hermann Boerhaave\n(1668\u20131738) of the University of Leyden. The theory is also\nendorsed in numerous scientific treatises of the early eighteenth\ncentury. The question of both individual and species origin was by\nthis theory removed to divine action at the first creation of the\nworld (Pyle 2006; Roger 1963 [1997: chp. 6]).\n\nAt least three variants of the theory of pre-existence can be\ndistinguished. Two of these assumed the pre-existence of forms in\nminiature. The original version assumed the encasement of the\nminiature form in the ovaries of the female (Ovism). Following the\ndiscovery in 1677 of spermatozoa by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek\n(1632\u20131723), the theory of the preformation of the embryo in the\nmale spermatazoa (Vermism) was introduced. These two versions of\n\u201cpreformationism\u201d generally became the main options one\nfinds expressed in the professional medical and gynecological\nliterature of the 1670\u20131740 period (Pinto-Correia, 1997,\nStephanson and Wagner, 2015). A third alternative, but one which had\nfew followers in the seventeenth and early eighteenth century until\nthe 1770s, was the theory of pre-formed \u201cgerms\u201d, given its\nfirst clear statement by Claude Perrault (1608\u201380). This\nPerrault theory, which closely resembled the Augustinian theory of the\nrationes seminales (1.2 above), held that the first primordia\nof organisms were formed at the original creation as seeds dispersed\nin the soil, from which they were taken in with food. Under the proper\nconditions and within the correct organisms, these \u201cgerms\u201d\nbecame implanted in the ovaries from which they then developed in\nresponse to fertilization. In all three accounts, the act of\nfertilization provided the occasion, and not the cause, of the\ndevelopment of organisms in time.\n\nThe theory of pre-existence was seen to solve many problems. First, it\nexplained the intimate interrelation of structure and function that\nseemed to require the existence of parts of the organism in an\nintegrated system. The heart presumably could not beat without\nennervation, and the nerves could not exist without the heart.\nConsequently, as the argument went, the entire organism must\npre-exist. The existence of such integrated systems seemed otherwise\ndifficult to explain by the sequential development of parts, as\nimplied in Aristotelian and other \u201cepigenetic\u201d theories of\ndevelopment. Second, this account was easily harmonized with\ntheological developments in the seventeenth century, particularly on\nthe Continent, where the strong influence of Augustinian theology on\nCalvinism (Protestant) and Jansenism (Catholic) was most in evidence.\nAs an example, it provided for the transmission of Original Sin. The\nsolution that emerged was a \u201ctheistic\u201d mechanism that\nemphasized God\u2019s omnipotence and the corresponding passivity of\nnature (Gaukroger 2010; Roger 1993, 1997a, chp. 6]). A third advantage\nof the theory of preexistence, at least in the versions that embraced\nthe \u201cpreformed germs\u201d interpretation, was that it allowed\nfor the appearance of life in secular time, which seemed to be\nsuggested by the existence of fossil forms. At the same time no\nversions of preexistence theory implied any change of species or\ndevelopment of one species from another in time. Finally, some version\nof a theory of the preformation of the embryo could be reconciled with\nthe best microscopic observations of the late seventeenth and early\neighteenth centuries, as these were reported by such experts on this\ninstrument as van Leeuwenhoek, Jan Swammerdam, Marcello Malpighi\n(1628\u20131694), and Henry Baker (1690\u20131774).\n\nThese preexistence theories of embryological origin directly affected\nthe question of species transformism. First, they effectively removed\nthe organism from the effects of local circumstance and environmental\nconditions. Second, they all placed the origin of species, as well as\nthat of at least the primordia of the individual organism, at a moment\nin the original divine creation. A quotation from a contemporary\nreview article illustrates several aspects of the thesis of\npreexistence:\n\n\nAnd indeed all the Laws of Motion which are as yet discovered, can\ngive but a very lame account of the forming of a Plant or Animal. We\nsee how wretchedly Des Cartes came off when he began to apply\nthem to this subject; they are form\u2019d by Laws yet unknown to\nMankind, and it seems most probable that the Stamina of all\nthe Plants and Animals that have ever been, or ever shall be in the\nWorld, have been formed ab Origine Mundi [from the foundation\nof the world] by the Almighty Creator within the first of each\nrespective kind. (Garden 1691: 476\u2013477)\n\n\nThe immediate consequence of this theory was a new rigidity given to\nthe concept of species that it had not possessed in the Aristotelian\nand Scholastic traditions. Preexistence theory reinforced a sharp\ndistinction between \u201cessential\u201d and\n\u201caccidental\u201d properties to a degree not implied by the\nprior tradition. At the same time, preexistence theory made it\ndifficult to explain obvious empirical phenomena, such as monstrosity,\nthe regeneration of lost parts, the resemblances of offspring to both\nparents, evidence for geographical variation, racial differences, and\nthe existence of hybrid forms such as the mule. It seemed necessary to\nattribute these anomalies to divine action at an original creation.\nThese difficulties in the theory resulted in a variety of criticisms\nthat were eventually to lead to the downfall of preexistence theory in\nits original form, although the theory was to have a long subsequent\nhistory through a modification of the \u201cgerm\u201d theory\n(Detlefsen 2006; Roger 1997a, chp. 7; Roe 1981).\n\nThe dominance of some form of pre-existence theory of generation\nbetween roughly 1670 and the 1740s provides some explanation for the\nlack of efforts among natural philosophers to develop transformist\ntheories of species origins in the same period. A notable exception to\nthis claim was the Epicurean cosmology resembling some aspects of\nLucretius\u2019s poem, developed by the French philosophe\nBen\u00f4it de Maillet (1656\u20131738) in his privately circulated\nmanuscript Telliamed that was known in French circles for ten\nyears before its publication in 1748 (Maillet, 1748). In this work de\nMaillet offered bold speculations on how sea creatures developed into\nland forms over time. Nonetheless, the period before the middle of the\neighteenth century was dominated by a theory of organic generation\nthat effectively precluded the naturalistic development of species.\nThe development of scientific transformism can be seen to be\nintimately tied to new theories of generation, and also to the\ndevelopment of \u201cactive\u201d rather than \u201cpassive\u201d\nconceptions of matter.\n",
