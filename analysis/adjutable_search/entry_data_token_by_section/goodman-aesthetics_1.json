    "main_text": "Classifying and Constructing Worlds\n2. Classifying and Constructing Worlds\n\nOne way of approaching Goodman\u2019s aesthetics, and of seeing both\nits unity and continuity with his work in other areas of philosophy,\nis by recalling some of the ideas presented in one of his early works,\nFact, Fiction, and Forecast (originally published in 1954\n[Goodman 1983]). There Goodman formulates what he calls \u201cthe\ngeneral problem of projection\u201d (of which the famous \u201cnew\nriddle of induction\u201d is an instance). The problem is grounded in\nthe general idea that we project predicates onto reality (a reality\nthat is itself \u201cconstructed\u201d by those projections,\naccording to the constructivist approach Goodman defended from the\ntime of A Study of Qualities [1941], hence in The\nStructure of Appearance [1951] and, later, in Ways of\nWorldmaking [1978a]). Hume famously claimed that inductions are\nbased on regularities found in experience, and concluded that the\ninductive predictions may very well turn out being false. In Fact,\nFiction, and Forecast, Goodman points out how\n\u201cregularities\u201d are themselves in a sense problematic. Take\nsuch objects as emeralds, which we classify by using the predicate\n\u201cgreen.\u201d They can also be said to be \u201cgrue,\u201d\ni.e., observed up to a certain time t and found green, blue\notherwise. Hence, our observations seem to equally grant two different\ninductions\u2014that emeralds will remain green after t or\nthat they will be blue. The problem is a general one, involving not\njust hypotheses but the projection of any predicate onto the world.\nIndeed, as we divide the world into green and blue\nthings, so could we divide it into grue and bleen\nthings (things that are observed up to t and found blue, and\ngreen otherwise). Notice that, under a description of the world using\nthe \u201cgreen/blue\u201d predicate pair, there may be no change at\ntime t (no change in the color of emeralds and sapphires for\nexample), whereas there would be change under the alternative\n\u201cgrue/bleen\u201d pair. Likewise, whereas there may be change,\nat time t, under \u201cgreen/blue\u201d (in case that, say,\nan emerald is painted over at t), there may be no change\nunder the alternative pair, \u201cgrue/bleen.\u201d The new riddle\nof induction\u2014and, in general, the problem of\nprojection\u2014is, then, to explain what are the bases for\nprojecting certain predicates\u2014\u201cgreen,\u201d\n\u201cblue,\u201d \u201cred,\u201d etc.\u2014onto the world, and\nnot others\u2014\u201cgrue,\u201d \u201cbleen,\u201d\n\u201cgred,\u201d etc. For, as Goodman states it,\n\u201c[r]egularities are where you find them, and you can find them\nanywhere\u201d (1983, 83). There is no difference in principle\nbetween the predicates we use and those we could use, but rather a\npragmatic difference in habit, or of\n\u201centrenchment\u201d of certain predicates and not others.\n\nWhen one combines the idea of predicate entrenchment to that for which\nour successfully projecting certain predicates (and more generally\nsymbols) rather than others modifies our observation and very\nperception of reality (indeed it amounts to constructing\ndifferent realities), one has the basis for Goodman\u2019s general\napproach to our cognitive relationship to the world, of which art is a\nfundamental component. Artworks, too, are symbols, referring to the\nworld (or the worlds they contribute to construct) in a\nvariety of different ways. Understanding the worlds of art is no\ndifferent, in kind, from understanding the worlds of science or of\nordinary perception: it requires interpretation of the\nvarious symbols involved in those areas. Which symbols are\nsuccessfully projected over time\u2014and, for instance, which\nartistic styles are perceived as familiar and which ones as\nrevolutionary, or which linguistic formulas are categorized as literal\nand which ones as metaphorical\u2014largely depends on what is\ncustomary, \u201centrenched,\u201d within a certain cultural,\nartistic, or linguistic community.\n",
