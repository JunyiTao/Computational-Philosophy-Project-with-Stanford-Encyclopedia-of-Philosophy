    "main_text": "Types of Events || Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements, and States\n2.1 Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements, and States\n\nPhilosophers who agree with a conception of events as particulars\ntypically distinguish different sorts of such particulars. A classic\ntypology distinguishes four sorts: activities, accomplishments,\nachievements, and states (Ryle 1949; Vendler 1957). An\nactivity, such as Anita\u2019s walking uphill, is a\nhomogeneous event: its sub-events satisfy the same description as the\nactivity itself, which has no natural finishing point or culmination.\nAn accomplishment, such as Anita\u2019s climbing the\nmountain, may have a culmination, but is never homogeneous. An\nachievement, such as Anita\u2019s reaching the top,\nis a culminating event (and is therefore always\ninstantaneous). And a state, such as Anita\u2019s knowing\nthe shortest way, is homogeneous and may extend over time, but it\nmakes no sense to ask how long it took or whether it culminated.\nSometimes accomplishments and achievements are grouped together into a\nsingle category of performances (Kenny 1963). Sometimes\nachievements have also been called events tout court and all\nother events have been grouped together into a broadly understood\ncategory of temporally extended entities, called processes\n(Ingarden 1935); the word \u2018eventuality\u2019 may then\nbe used as a label covering both categories (Bach 1986).\n\nSome authors introduce aspectual considerations into the taxonomy,\ndrawing on Aristotle\u2019s distinction between Energeia and\nKin\u00easis (Ackrill 1965). The idea is that different\nverbs describe different types of events: verbs with no continuous\nform (\u2018know\u2019) correspond to states; verbs with continuous\nform for which the present continuous entails the past perfect\n(\u2018Anita is walking uphill\u2019 entails \u2018Anita walked\nuphill\u2019) correspond to activities; and verbs for which the\npresent continuous entails the negation of the past perfect\n(\u2018Anita is climbing the mountain\u2019 entails \u2018Anita has\nnot (yet) climbed the mountain\u2019, at least in the relevant\ncontext) correspond to performances (Potts 1965; Taylor 1965; Evans\n1967; Mourelatos 1978; Graham 1980). This basic taxonomy can be\nrefined in various ways (see Mittwoch 2019 for an overview) and\nseveral linguistically sophisticated theories of verb tense and aspect\nhave been developed on such grounds (see, inter alia, Comrie\n1976; Taylor 1977; Dowty 1979; Declerck 1979; Freed 1979; Bach 1981;\nMittwoch 1988; Galton 1984; Krifka 1989; Verkuyl 1989; Smith 1991;\nGiorgi & Pianesi 1998; K\u00fchl 2008). However, the legitimacy of\ndrawing ontological categorizations from such linguistic distinctions\nhas been questioned (Gill 1993).\n",
