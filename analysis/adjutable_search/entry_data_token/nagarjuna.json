Life and works\n\nEven though legendary accounts abound, very little can be said\nprecisely about N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s life. That\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna was a Buddhist monk who lived some time between\n150 and 250 CE, probably mainly in southern India is rarely disputed.\nIf we want to go beyond these bare facts, however, intricate\nhistorical detective work is required. Some interesting connections\nhave been discovered by this but they are of limited importance in the\npresent context which is primarily aimed at providing information\nabout N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s philosophical works. The interested\nreader is referred to Mabbett 1998 and Walser 2005 for further\ndiscussion.\n\nFortunately there is more information about\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s works than there is about his life but the\nsituation is still far from ideal: it is not easy to come up with a\nprecise list of texts N\u0101g\u0101rjuna composed. This is partly due\nto the fact that different authors bearing the name\n\u201cN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u201d might have lived during different\nperiods of the development of Buddhist thought in India, and partly\ndue to the tendency of attributing newly composed works to the great\nauthorities of the past. For the present purposes, however, we can\ndivide N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s works into three main groups\n(further discussion can be found in Ruegg 1981, Lindtner 1982). In the\nlist I give here the ascription of the works mentioned to\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna is largely uncontested. References to reliable\ntranslations into English are provided in the list of primary sources\nin the bibliography.\n\nThe argumentative works\n\n\n\n\nThe Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way (MMK)\n(M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101). This is the most\nimportant of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s works. In its 450 stanzas it\nexpounds the entire compass of his thought and constitutes the central\ntext of the \u201cphilosophy of the Middle Way\u201d. It has been\ncommented upon by a large number of later authors. (Ye 2011 provides a\nuseful edition of the Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese recensions of\nthis work). \n\n\nThe Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning\n(Yukti\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dik\u0101). A shorter treatise,\ndiscussing the notions of emptiness and dependent origination\n(prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da). \n\n\nThe Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness\n(\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101saptati). Another short treatise,\ndealing in addition with questions of agency and the two truths.\n\n\n\nThe Dispeller of Disputes (Vigrahavy\u0101vartan\u012b). In\nthis work of seventy verses with an autocommentary in prose\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna responds to a set of specific objections raised\nagainst his system. These objections come both from Buddhist and\nnon-Buddhist opponents and initiate discussions of topics which do not\nget much coverage in N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s other works (in\nparticular epistemology and the philosophy of language). \n\n\nThe Treatise on Pulverization (Vaidalyaprakara\u1e47a). A\nvery interesting and difficult work in which N\u0101g\u0101rjuna sets\nout to refute the logical categories of the non-Buddhist Ny\u0101ya\nschool. Like d. this text has never attracted the attention of\nclassical commentators. \n\n\nThe Precious Garland (Ratn\u0101val\u012b). A long text\naddressed to a king containing a comprehensive discussion of ethical\nquestions. Because discussion of the theory of emptiness plays a\ncomparatively minor role in this text it is sometimes subsumed under\nthe epistolary works (see below). \n \n\n\nThe hymns (Catu\u1e25stava). There is some discussion which\nof the various hymns ascribed to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna actually make up\nthe quartet of \u2018four hymns\u2019 often referred to in the\ncommentarial literature. They differ in interesting respects from the\nworks mentioned in the preceding section. Common to many of them is a\npositive conception of ultimate truth which ascribes specific\nqualities to it and gets close to the theory of Buddha-nature\n(tath\u0101gatagarbha) that became very important in the\nlater development of Buddhist thought. \n\n\nThe epistolary works. The Friendly Letter (Suh\u1e5bllekha),\nlike the Precious Garland (Ratn\u0101val\u012b), which is\nsometimes assigned to this group is a work addressed to a king. This\nfact may explain why the text is primarily concerned with ethical\nmatters. It devotes relatively little space to the kind of\nphilosophical discussion which is N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s most\ncharacteristic contribution to Buddhist thought. \n\n2. Emptiness and svabh\u0101va\n\nThe central concept around which all of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nphilosophy is built is the notion of emptiness\n(\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101). Emptiness is of course always the\nemptiness of something, and the something N\u0101g\u0101rjuna has in\nmind here is svabh\u0101va. Different terms have been used to\ntranslate this word into English: \u201cinherent existence\u201d and\n\u201cintrinsic nature\u201d appear to be the more popular choices,\nbut \u201csubstance\u201d and \u201cessence\u201d have also been\nproposed. None of these cover the full complexity of the term,\nhowever. We therefore have to give some more detailed account of the\nway svabh\u0101va is characterized in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s thought. By understanding what empty\nthings are supposed to be empty of we simultaneously gain a more\nprecise understanding of the concept of emptiness.\n\nWe can distinguish two main conceptual dimensions of the concept of\nsvabh\u0101va, an ontological one, which refers to a\nparticular way in which objects exist, and a cognitive one, which\nrefers to a way in which objects are conceptualized by human beings.\nWithin the ontological dimension we can distinguish three different\nunderstandings of svabh\u0101va: in terms of essence, in\nterms of substance, and in terms of absolute reality. (Even though\nthis distinction is largely based on Madhyamaka authors later than\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna it is still a useful heuristic tool for\nunderstanding the philosophical point he was trying to make.)\n\nIf we understand svabh\u0101va in terms of essence it has to\nbe considered a property an object could not lose without ceasing to\nbe that very object: the svabh\u0101va of fire is to be hot,\nthe svabh\u0101va of water to be wet: whatever ceases to be\nhot is no longer fire, whatever ceases to be wet is no longer water.\nAccording to this understading svabh\u0101va is also\nidentified with the kind of specific qualities\n(svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) that allow an observer to\ndistinguish an object from other things: by knowing that something is\nhot, together with a variety of other svalak\u1e63a\u1e47as\nwe know that what we have in front of us is fire rather than something\nelse. It is important to note that this concept of\nsvabh\u0101va (which plays only a small role in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s writings but becomes more important in\nlater Madhyamaka writers) is not the target of the Madhyamaka\ncritique. When N\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues that things are empty of\nsvabh\u0101va it is not this notion of essence he is\nconcerned with. The philosophically more important understanding of\nsvabh\u0101va is an understanding in terms of substance.\n\nIn Buddhist philosophical thought preceding N\u0101g\u0101rjuna we\nfind the distinction between primary existents (dravyasat)\nand secondary existents (praj\u00f1aptisat). Primary\nexistents constitute the objective and irreducible constituents of the\nworld out there while secondary existents depend on our conceptual and\nlinguistic practices. Early schools of Buddhist metapysics hold that\nonly irreducible dharmas (entities that may be conceptualized\nanalogous to particularized properties or tropes (see Goodman 2004))\nare really real whereas everything else, including shoes and ships and\nsealing-wax is a mere aggregate of such dharmas constructed\nby our conceptualizing mind. According to this theory the entire world\naround us would be relegated to the status of mere secondary\nexistents, apart from the property particulars which are primary\nexistents. In this context svabh\u0101va is equated with\nprimary existence and denotes a specific ontological status: to exist\nwith svabh\u0101va means to be part of the basic furniture of\nthe world, independent of anything else that also happens to exist.\nSuch objects provide the ontological rock-bottom on which the diverse\nworld of phenomena rests. They provide the end-point of a chain of\nontological dependence relations.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues, however, that there is no such end-point\nand denies the existence of an ontological foundation (see Westerhoff\n2017. For the relation of this idea to the debate about the\nwell-foundedness of grounding in contemporary metaphysics see chapter\n3 of Westerhoff 2020). This fact is sometimes used as support of the\naccusation that Madhyamaka is really a nihilistic doctrine, a doctrine\nthat nothing exists. For if the secondary existent is reduced to the\nprimary, and if there is no primary, what is there left? This\ninterpretation has a relatively long history, beginning in ancient\nIndia and continuing to find supporters nowadays (see Spackman 2014,\nWesterhoff 2016). Nevertheless, there are powerful systematic and\nhistorical reasons against it. First of all, it is not clear that this\nkind of ontological nihilism is in fact a consistent position (if\nthere is nothing, is there not at least the fact that there is\nnothing, i.e. something? See, however, Westerhoff 2021). Secondly, the\nM\u0101dhyamikas themselves are very clear that their position avoids\nboth of the extreme views, the view that believes in the existence of\nsvabh\u0101va as well as its nihilistic opposite.\n\nIt is the understanding of svabh\u0101va as a primary\nexistent or substance that constitutes the main target of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s philosophical criticism. Before we have a\ncloser look at the form this criticism takes we must briefly mention\nthe final ontological understanding of svabh\u0101va, namely\nsvabh\u0101va as absolute reality. If svabh\u0101va\nis regarded as the true nature of phenomena it is sometimes\ncharacterized as not brought about by any causal process, as\nunchangeable and as independent of any other object. The interesting\nproblem arising here is that for the Madhyamaka the true nature of\nphenomena is emptiness, i.e. the absence of svabh\u0101va\nunderstood as substance, and that svabh\u0101va understood in\nthis way is also characterized as not brought about by any\ncausal process, as unchangeable and as independent of any other\nobject. So it seems to be the case that something that has all these\nproperties must exist (since there is svabh\u0101va which is\nthe true nature of phenomena) and must not exist (since, the\nMadhyamaka argues, svabh\u0101va understood as substance does\nnot exist). In the Buddhist commentarial literature we find several\ndifferent ways of dissolving this contradiction (for more discussion\nsee Westerhoff 2009: 40\u201346). One way of tackling the issue is by\ndifferentiating two senses in which svabh\u0101va can be\n\u201cindependent of any other object\u201d. This can be understood\nas the familiar understanding of substance as a primary existent noted\nabove. But it can also be understood as meaning \u201cnot dependent\non any specific phenomenon\u201d. We could then argue that emptiness\nas the true nature of phenomena is to be understood as\nsvabh\u0101va and thus as independent only in the second, but\nnot in the first sense. This is due to the fact that\nsvabh\u0101va in the sense rejected by Madhyamaka thinkers is\nregarded as a superimposition mistakenly projected onto objects which\nin fact lack it (see below). Thus emptiness only exists as long as\nsvabh\u0101va understood as substance is mistakenly projected\nonto some object or other. Emptiness does not depend on any specific\nphenomenon to exist, but there has to be some phenomenon mistakenly\nconceived for emptiness to exist. Emptiness is not some kind of\nprimordial reality ante rem but a corrective to a mistaken\nview of how the world exists. This account boils down to saying that\nthere really are only two ways of understanding\nsvabh\u0101va: as essence and as substance. What was earlier\ncalled svabh\u0101va as absolute reality is only a specific\nform of svabh\u0101va understood as essence: in the same way\nas heat is an essential quality of fire emptiness is an essential\nquality of all phenomena. Things could not be the things they are\nwithout being empty.\n\nIn concluding our exposition of the different conceptual dimensions\nthat make up the concept of svabh\u0101va in Madhyamaka\nthought we finally have to consider the cognitive understanding of the\nterm. This constitutes an indispensable component of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s concept since for him the purpose of\ndetermining the existence or non-existence of svabh\u0101va\nis not just to arrive at a theoretically satisfactory understanding of\nreality but is taken to have far more comprehensive implications for\nhow we interact with the world. Realization of the non-existence of\nsvabh\u0101va is supposed to have important soteriological\nconsequences as part of Buddhist practice; ultimately it is understood\nto be the way to the liberation from existential suffering, the final\nof the famous four noble truths expounded by the Buddha. It is\nimportant to realize that svabh\u0101va understood as\nsubstance that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna rejects is not a theoretical posit,\nan entity an insufficiently sophisticated philosopher might postulate,\nbut a kind of cognitive default, a way of superimposing something onto\nthe world that is automatic and immediate and not the result of\ndetailed theoretical reflection. We carry out such superimpositions\nwhen we regard the rapidly changing set of psycho-physical aggregates\nthat constitutes us as a single, permanent, independent self but also\nin our daily interaction with other persons, medium-sized dry goods,\nlinguistic representations and so forth. These then lead to all sorts\nof painful emotional entanglements and constitute the key source of\nsuffering described in the Buddhist teachings. It is crucial to keep\nin mind in this context that the Madhyamaka distinguishes between the\nunderstanding of the absence of svabh\u0101va or emptiness\nand its realization. The former is a purely intellectual response\nresulting from being convinced by the Madhyamaka arguments; it does\nnot entail that phenomena will no longer appear as having\nsvabh\u0101va. They will only cease to appear in this way as\na result of the realization of emptiness. The aim of Madhyamaka\nthought is therefore not simply to present an accurate account of the\nnature of the world, but to bring about a cognitive shift, a change in\nthe way in which the world appears to us. It is useful to compare this\nsituation with the perception of an optical illusion such as the\nM\u00fcller-Lyer illusion in which two lines of equal length appear to\nbe of different length. By using a ruler we can convince ourselves\nthat our perception deceives us; by learning more about perceptive\nmechanisms we can understand why we perceive the lines in the way they\ndo. But none of this implies that the lines will in the end\nlook as if they are equally long.\n3. Arguments against svabh\u0101va\n\nAs we noted earlier the understanding of svabh\u0101va in\nterms of substance (which is rejected by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna)\nconceives of it as an end-point in a series of dependence relations.\nVarious kinds of dependence relations are discussed in the Madhyamaka\nliterature; the most important ones for our purposes are mereological\ndependence (the dependence of a composite object on its parts), causal\ndependence (the dependence of an effect on its cause) and conceptual\ndependence (the dependence of an object on the conceptualizing mind).\nFor the Madhyamaka these dependence relations are equivalent to the\nextent that none ever bottoms out. They do have different weight in\ntheir philosophical argumentation, however, since only establishing\nthat conceptual dependence does not have a foundation is sufficient\nfor establishing the absence of svabh\u0101va in the\ncomprehensive sense intended by the Madhyamaka philosophers. Even if\nthere was no foundation for mereological dependence, i.e. even if\nthere were no partless particles, or no foundation of causal\ndependence, i.e. no first cause there would still remain an important\nsense in which things exist substantially, namely independent of human\ncognition and conceptualization. Only if we can show that no objects\nexist independently with respect to conceptual dependence are we able\nto establish N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s anti-foundationalism in the\nfull sense.\n\nIt is interesting to note that despite the fact that arguing for the\nnon-existence of svabh\u0101va and the establishment of the\ntheory of universal emptiness is the central concern of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s philosophy we do not find a \u201cmaster\nargument\u201d to accomplish this (see Siderits 2000: 228 and 2003:\n147). Of course we do find systematic lists of the core Madhyamaka\narguments, in particular in the later scholastic developments of this\nschool but none of them is regarded as the single argument that\nsettles the matter once and for all. The reason for this comes\ndirectly from the comprehensive rejection of svabh\u0101va.\nIf nothing has its nature intrinsically and independently there can\nalso be no argument for a particular thesis that by its very nature\nestablishes its conclusion independent of the context in which it is\nmade and independent of the audience towards which it is directed. The\nMadhyamaka refutation of svabh\u0101va must proceed in a\nstep-by-step manner. If there is someone who believes that some\nobjects of kind x exist substantially the Madhyamaka will\nproduce an argument to show that these objects really lack\nsvabh\u0101va. For another opponent, who thinks that not the\nxs but the ys are substantial a different argument\nhas to be used. It is plausible, however, that there are certain areas\nof human thought in which human beings inevitably superimpose\nsvabh\u0101va on things which in fact lack it. A great deal\nof Madhyamaka literature is devoted to the discussion of these, and to\narguments showing their lack of svabh\u0101va. The following\nsection will examine some of these areas more closely.\n3.1 Causation\n\nIn N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s discussion of causation we usually find\nhim investigating a set of alternative ways in which cause and effect\ncould be related. Each of these is subsequently found to be\nunsatisfactory. As a result N\u0101g\u0101rjuna does not conclude that\ncausation is impossible, but that our understanding of the causal\nrelation must be based on some faulty premiss. This premiss is the\npresupposition that cause and effect exist with their own\nsvabh\u0101va. What this means is that they are qualitatively\ndistinct, independent objects: first the cause exists without the\neffect, later the effect can exist without the cause, once the cause\nhas passed out of existence. Apart from being independent of each\nother, cause and effect are also independent of the cognizing mind.\nThe chain of causes and conditions is something that exists out there\nin the world, independent of human interests and concerns.\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna intends to show that because there is something\nwrong with all the understandings of causation usually\nencountered, the difficulty is likely to lie in a mistaken supposition\nthat underlies all of them.\n\nIn his most well-known discussion of causation N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\ndistinguishes four ways in which things could be causally be brought\nabout. They could be produced\n\nfrom themselves, or\nfrom other things, or\nfrom both themselves and from other things, or\nfrom neither.\n\n3.1.1 Self-causation\n\nThe idea that things are their own causes is a somewhat peculiar one.\nThe Buddhist discussion usually distinguishes two different views\nunder this heading: that cause and effect are the very same object,\nand that the effect is somehow contained in the cause. One plausible\ncandidate for the identity of cause and effect is persistence through\ntime. The idea here is that the cause of the present rock is the rock\none second ago, and that these two rocks are the very same thing. Of\ncourse this only works if we are not endurantists, i.e. if we do not\nthink that there are different temporal slices all of which make up\nthe rock. If this is the case then what we are looking at here is one\npart of an object causing another, rather than one object causing\nitself. For a perdurantist who believes there is some object wholly\npresent during each time there is the difficulty that we usually\nbelieve causes to temporally precede their effects. No object can be\ntemporally prior to itself, however.\n\nAssuming that the effect is somehow already contained in the cause (or\nin the causal field, that is in the collection of the cause and all\nthe necessary background conditions) might be a more interesting way\nof spelling out self-causation. This also entails that when the cause\nis present, the effect is present too, contrary to our usual\nassumption that it is the cause which brings about the effect at a\nlater time. Yet we are not able to find the effect if we look amongst\nthe components of the causal field: amongst petrol, oxygen, a spark\nand so forth there is no explosion to be found. This does not mean\nthat given a sufficiently detailed description of the causal field we\nmight not be able to infer the effect. But this would hardly be\nsufficient to allow us to speak of the containment of the effect in\nthe cause.\n3.1.2 Causation from other things\n\nTo assume that cause and effect are distinct phenomena might strike us\nas the most natural understanding of causation. Yet\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues that cause and effect cannot be\nsubstantially distinct. This is because the effect depends\nexistentially on the cause (if the cause did not exist the\neffect would not exist) and the cause depends at least\nnotionally on the effect (if there was no effect the cause\nwould not be called \u201ccause\u201d). The kind of independence\ndemanded by substantial existence, by existence by\nsvabh\u0101va, is simply not available for things which are\ncause and effect. On the other hand if we had a set of objects that\nwere distinct in the required sense it would be hard to see how we\ncould make sense of any of these being either cause or effect since no\npair of objects from the set would be connected by a dependence\nrelation. If two objects are distinct by svabh\u0101va there\ncannot be any dependence relation of any kind holding between them.\nFor any two objects from this set that we label \u201ccause\u201d\nand \u201ceffect\u201d we can similarly imagine reversing the\nassignment as the existence of any one does not influence the\nexistence of any other. But this implies that it cannot be the causal\nrelation we are talking about, since in general the roles of cause and\neffect cannot be switched.\n3.1.3 Causation from both themselves and from other things\n\nThe most convincing way of understanding this alternative is in terms\nof a cause that contains the effect in itself as a potentiality that\nis actualized given certain conditions. A block of marble (the cause)\nmay be said to contain a statue (the result) as a potentiality that is\nmade real by a variety of supporting conditions, namely the\nsculptor\u2019s actions. Here cause and effect are not wholly\ndistinct (since the block and the statue share some parts) nor are\nthey identical (since the block is not the statue), thereby avoiding\nthe difficulties implied by the preceding two accounts. This account\nis fine as far as it goes, but it would not support the contention\nthat either cause or effect exist substantially, with\nsvabh\u0101va. The supporting conditions could not exist\nwithout the block and the statue could not exist without either or\nthese. None of the objects involved have the roles they play from\ntheir own side, independently of one another.\n3.1.4 Causation from neither\n\nA final possibility to envisage is that causation is neither\nself-causation nor causation from a distinct object. This is usually\nunderstood as the belief in the complete absence of causation since\nthe first three alternatives are taken to be exhaustive: if these\nalternatives are ruled out the only remaining possibility is that\nthere are no causal relata since there is no causal relation. A major\ndifficulty with this view is that it fails to account for our ability\nto grasp facts about the world, since our epistemic access is most\nplausibly understood as causal. If there is no causal interaction\nbetween our sense-organs and the objects out there how is knowledge of\nthe world possible at all? A further concern is the fact that the\nworld appears to us to be causally ordered. It is not the\ncase that more or less anything follows from anything else, but\ncertain things only follow from certain other things. As such an\naccount that denies the existence of causal relations altogether\ncannot be a satisfactory account of the world as we experience it.\n\nNeither of the four alternatives just examined allows a plausible\nunderstanding of cause and effect as existing with\nsvabh\u0101va. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna therefore argues that\nthere must be something wrong with the assumption that cause and\neffect exist in this way. They are not independent but mutually\ndependent. The dependence of the effect on the cause is easy to\nunderstand: if there was no cause there would not have been any\neffect. But how can we make sense of the reverse? Even if the cause\nhad not produced the effect if would still have existed (even though\nit would not have been called \u201ccause\u201d). There are three\ndifferent ways in which we can make sense of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s assertion that the cause also depends\nexistentially on the effect.\n\n(a) Firstly we can argue that if N\u0101g\u0101rjuna debates with an\nopponent who holds that since a cause has its property of being a\ncause essentially, its notional dependence on the effect will entail\nits existential dependence. For something being a cause essentially\nmeans that this is a property it could not lose without ceasing to be\nthat very object. But since the presence of this property depends on\nexistence of the effect, the existence of the cause as that very\nobject also depends on the existence of the effect.\n\n(b) A second interpretation which does not have to assume that causes\nare essentially causes argues that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna does not intend\nto refer to the existential dependence of some particular cause on its\neffect but rather to the existential dependence of the\nproperty of being a cause on the property of being an effect.\nIf an object a falling under property P notionally depends on\nsomething falling under Q this means that the property P\nexistentially depends on the property Q, as P can\nonly exist if some object falls under the property \u2018identical\nwith the property Q\u2019, i.e., if the property Q\nexists.\n\nThe property \u2018being the left side of my body\u2019 depends\nexistentially on the property \u2018being the right side of my\nbody\u2019, even though the objects falling under each do not\nexistentially depend on one another. This is due to the fact that one\nproperty could not exist without the other one, but the objects\nfalling under them could. In the case of cause and effect we could\ntherefore interpret N\u0101g\u0101rjuna as saying that the properties\n\u2018being a cause\u2019 and \u2018being an effect\u2019 depend\nexistentially on one another, even though the existential dependence\nof objects falling under them is not symmetric: the effect depends\nexistentially on the cause, but the cause does not need the effect for\nits existence.\n\n(c) The third and final reading claims that while N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\nundoubtedly also wanted to assert the existential dependence of the\nproperties \u2018being a cause\u2019 and \u2018being an\neffect\u2019 on each other he moreover made the claim that not only\nthe particular object which is the effect needs the cause for its\nexistence, but the cause also needs the effect. Such a reading can be\nsupported by considering an entire causal field, that is the cause\ntogether with the necessary background conditions, rather than just\nparticular causes. A causal field is a cognitive artefact, a\ncollection of objects assembled with the sole purpose of explaining\nwhy a particular effect came about. Divorced from this explanatory\nrole there is no reason for introducing the concept at all. We might\ntherefore want to argue that the causal field also depends for its\nexistence on the effect it produces. This is of course not to say that\nevery member of the causal field existentially depends on the effect\nthey jointly bring about: the spark, petrol, and so forth would still\nexist, even if they for some reason did not manage to bring about an\nexplosion. But the collection only exists if there is some effect it\ncauses. Whether we want to argue that a causal field depends for its\nexistence on the effect it brings about is intimately connected with\nour view of the existence of collections. We might either think that\nwhenever the are some objects there is the collection of those\nobjects. Or we might deny that every arbitrary assembly of objects\nconstitutes a collection. We would then argue that for some objects to\nform a collection there must be something which makes them hold\ntogether as a collection, for example that they all exemplify a\nproperty, or that they were put together for a specific purpose. If we\nadopt the first view of collections then clearly a causal field will\nonly depend notionally on its effect, since \u2018being a causal\nfield bringing about that effect\u2019 is only one way in which we\ncan refer to the pre-existent collection that contains all the\nelements of the causal field, but not anything which brings it about.\nAdopting the second conception, however, it may be the case that the\nonly thing that binds all the members of the causal field together is\nthat they are considered to be the things that jointly bring about a\nparticular effect. In the absence of this effect the collection\ndisintegrates and ceases to exist.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna seems to favour the second interpretation when he\nasserts that a cause could not exist without an effect. (MMK 4.3) It\nis significant that what is denied here is not just the ascription\nof the label \u2018cause\u2019 to some object because it is\nrelated to some other object, the effect, but the existence\nof the cause in the absence of the effect. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\nendorses not just the uncontroversial notional dependence of the cause\non its effect, but its existential dependence as well. Applied to the\ndiscussion of causal fields this implies that a causal field can only\nexist if the effect it brings about does, and for this reason cannot\nbe taken to exist whenever all of its members do. If we adopt reading\nc) given above we have to conclude that for N\u0101g\u0101rjuna causes\nand effects are both notionally and existentially dependent on one\nanother. They therefore cannot exist from their own side, irrespective\nof the existence of one another. Moreover, they also depend for their\nexistence on us, because it is our cognitive act of cutting up the\nworld of phenomena in the first place that creates the particular\nassembly of objects that constitutes a causal field, which then in\nturn gives rise to the notions of cause and effect. This entails that\nthe causal field, cause and effect are empty of\nsvabh\u0101va.\n\nAn important point we must not lose sight of in the context of the\ndiscussion of causation is that while showing that objects stand in\ncausal relations is sufficient for showing that they are empty of\nsvabh\u0101va in some way (since they do not exist\nindependently of one another), this on its own would not be sufficient\nsupport for N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s thesis of universal emptiness.\nJust the fact that some objects are cause and effect does not mean\nthat they exist in any way dependent on human cognition, and it is\nthis dependence on cognition or conceptualization that is generally\nregarded as the most profound understanding of emptiness. (It is also\nuseful to note in this context that the \u0100bhidharmikas, a Buddhist\nschool that was one of the main targets of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\ncriticism saw no conflict between objects being causally produced and\ntheir possessing svabh\u0101va.) Mark Siderits (2004: 411)\nhas pointed out that what we have to argue first of all is that the\nobjects we usually interact with are causally produced so that\nspeaking about them involves essential reference to causality. We\nfurther need to appeal to the principle that if some object\nessentially involves a property that is conceptually constructed then\nthe object is conceptually constructed too. Chess games are\nconceptually constructed, and since \u201cthe book describing the\nlongest chess game ever played\u201d essentially involves chess games\nit is conceptually constructed too. But, as N\u0101g\u0101rjuna set\nout to show, since the causal relation does not exist from its own\nside, is conceptually constructed, and therefore empty, each causally\nrelated object must be so constructed and therefore empty in the most\nprofound sense of being conceptually constructed.\n3.2 Change\n\nThe discussion of change, in particular that of spatio-temporal\nchange, of motion, occupies a prominent position in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s arguments. In the second chapter of the\nMMK we find a long discussion of the impossibility of motion.\nParallels with Zeno\u2019s paradoxes have been drawn and it has been\nargued that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s aim was to refute certain\nviews of the structure of space and time (Siderits and O\u2019Brien\n1976). Nevertheless, there is some evidence that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\ntwo main aims were something else: firstly, to reject a substantialist\ninterpretation of some of the key notions of the Buddhist teaching\nand, secondly, to defend a specific view of the relation between\nindividuals and their properties.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna employs two key arguments that we might want to\ncall the property-absence argument and the property-duplication\nargument. The first (MMK 2:3\u20133, 9\u201310) questions the\nsuitability of such statements like \u201cthe mover moves\u201d\nbecause there are difficulties conceiving of a mover without motion.\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues that there is a difficulty with thinking of\nthe individual (the mover) and the property (the motion) in the\nfamiliar way, as mutually independent objects. In the case of a blue\nvase the vase and the blueness can exist without each other (at least\nas long as we are not trope theorists) whereas there clearly is no\nmover that does not move. The two stand in a dependence relation since\nthe individual depends on the property it instantiates. It therefore\ncannot exist by svabh\u0101va.\n\nThe second argument (MMK 2:5, 11) states that if we were to think in\nterms of a mover moving there would be two motions rather than one:\nthat motion which makes the mover a mover, and that motion by which it\nmoves. The reason for this is that a mover is an example of an\nindividual where a distinction between its constitutive and\ninstantiated properties cannot be drawn. The constitutive property is\nwhat constitutes an individual (something is a cube, or a pot, or a\nvase) and the instantiated properties are had by the individual (it is\nheavy, or round, or blue). If we apply these notions to the case of\nthe moving mover we would require two different motions: one which\nconstitutes the individual and one which is its property. But of\ncourse there is only one motion: that of the moving mover. The point\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna makes here is not just there are problems when\nanalyzing statements like \u201cthe mover moves\u201d, \u201cthe\nthunder roars\u201d and so forth in terms of an ontology of\nconstitutive and instantiated properties but the more general\nobservation that this has implications for the way we can apply these\nterms even to more usual statements like \u201cthe vase is\nblue\u201d. That the distinction between constitutive and\ninstantiated properties makes no sense in the case of \u201cthe mover\nmoves\u201d shows that there is no substantial distinction between\nthese properties, and that the conceptualization of a situation in\nterms of them is purely a result of cognitive convenience. Since we\nwant to stress certain features we speak of a blue, round vase instead\nof a vase-shaped, round, blue thing or a vase-shaped, blue, round\nthing, but this in no way implies that there is a fundamental\ndifference between the properties \u201cbeing a vase\u201d,\n\u201cbeing round\u201d, and \u201cbeing blue\u201d so that only\none of them is constitutive while the others are instantiated. There\nis no ready-made world that is already sliced in such a way.\n\nWhen N\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues that neither mover nor motion exist by\nsvabh\u0101va he first of all makes an important point about\nsome central concepts of the Buddhist world-view. The goal of the\nBuddhist path is the liberation from cyclic existence, a form of\nexistence that is nothing but the moving about (sams\u1e5b)\nthrough a succession of rebirths. When N\u0101g\u0101rjuna speaks\nabout the mover (gati) he has in mind both the familiar\nmotion from one end of the road to another one as well as the motion\nfrom one life to the next. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s arguments to\nthe effect that mover and motion are interdependent, that the\nbeginning and end of motion are not to be found \u201cout\nthere\u201d in the world entail that the person who is reborn, the\ncyclic existence he is reborn in and the liberation from that cyclic\nexistence do not exist substantially.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s second main point is that his analysis of\nmotion has specific implications for our view of individuals and\nproperties. The aim of his arguments is to show that the distinction\nbetween individuals and properties is not one which exists independent\nof our conceptualizations. As the talk about the\n\u2018property\u2019 instantiated by an individual like a mover or a\nclap of thunder had to be explained in terms of a single feature seen\nin two different ways \u2013 as constitutive and as instantiating\n\u2013 in the same way talk of the properties of ordinary individuals\nsuch as a blue vase could be seen to be equally a reflection of the\ndivision of their features into constitutive and instantiating\nproperties, something which is just a reflection of our pragmatic\nconcerns in conceptualizing the individual in question, but not a\nreflection of its intrinsic nature.\n\nFor the Madhyamaka school conceiving of substances as individuals\ninstantiating properties is deeply unsatisfactory. For the sake of\nillustration (and using an Indian example) assume a substantially\nreal, fundamental entity the only property of which is being spatially\nextended. Now what is the individual in which this property inheres?\nAs it is not characterized by any other properties it must be some\nkind of propertyless bare particular. What makes it a bare particular?\nGiven that we are dealing with substances here it should not depend on\nsome other object. But if it is a bare particular by\nsvabh\u0101va and being a bare particular is therefore its\nintrinsic nature we are in the same situation as we were with the\nspatially extended entity. For now we can ask what the individual is\nin which being a bare particular inheres, and then we are well on our\nway into an infinite regress. Note that this problem does not got away\nif we feel uneasy about the property \u2018being a bare\nparticular\u2019 and do not want to admit it. For we have to assume\nthat the individual has some determinate nature due to which it is a\nbearer of its properties and the difficulty will just reappear with\nwhatever we take such a nature to be.\n\nIt does not help much if we conceive of substances as particularized\nproperties or tropes instead. For then it is unclear how we can\nindividuate one spatial-extension-trope from another. We cannot\ndifferentiate them according to the individuals in which they inhere\nbecause we have just rejected the existence of individuals at the\nlevel of substances. We cannot say that this spatial-extension-trope\nis different from that because they turn up in different individuals,\nsince the different individuals are just collections of tropes. Of\ncourse we could try to tell apart the various trope-substances by the\ncollections in which they occur (or, more precisely, by which other\ntropes they are related to via a higher-order compresence-trope). The\ndifficulty for this is that it introduces dependence-relations via the\nback door, for every trope will existentially depend on being\nconnected to just these other tropes via a compresence-trope \u2014\nwe cannot take a trope and \u2018move\u2019 it to another\ncollection. As we want to conceive of substances as entities that are\nnot existentially dependent on one another this approach inevitably\nintroduces a certain tension into our system. It thus becomes apparent\nthat once more a conceptual scheme that can be more or less\nstraightforwardly applied to non-substances breaks down once we\nattempt to analyse the supposedly foundational objects of our world in\nterms of it. While the analysis of a red apple into an individual and\nthe property it instantiates is at least on the face of it\nunproblematic, the same analysis generates problems when applied to\nultimate existents. (See, however, Siderits 2014, 2016: 113.)\n3.3 Personal identity\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s criticism of substance does not just apply\nto the world of objects, to the phenomena around us, but equally to\nthe world of subjects, that is our own and other persons\u2019 self.\nThis is very much in harmony with the Buddha\u2019s own conception of\na person that rejected a self existing with svabh\u0101va.\nSuch a self would have to be conceived of as distinct from both our\nbody and our psychological states, as essentially unchanging, as a\nunifier of our diverse beliefs, desires and sensory impressions, and\nas an agent that makes the decisions that shape our lives. The\nalternative presented by the Buddha is a view of the self that regards\nit as a continuously changing array of five psycho-physical aggregates\n(the physical body, sensation, perception, intellect, and\nconsciousness) without an inner core. Many of the arguments\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna presents when rejecting the notion of a\nsubstantially existent subject bear a close resemblance to those\nbrought forward by the Buddha himself. (See the entry on\n Buddha.) \n Nevertheless his works also provide\nus with some arguments with a distinctly N\u0101g\u0101rjunian\nslant. In MMK 18:2a the opponent wonders: \u2018if there was no self,\nwhere would the self\u2019s properties come from?\u2019 The worry\nbehind this question is that the undeniable fact that there are\nproperties of the self\u2014since the Madhyamaka does not want to\ndeny that seeing, feeling, tasting and so forth takes place \u2014\nimplies that there must be a bearer of such properties, i.e. a\nself. Since properties depend existentially on something that\ninstantiates them a self must be postulated as the instantiator of all\nthe mental properties we observe. It appears as if we need a\nsubstratum for the psychological states, desires, beliefs and so\non. However, the body, because of its continuously changing nature,\ncannot be regarded as adequate for such substratumhood.  Therefore\nsome kind of self has to be postulated.\n\nBut if we take into account the distinction between constitutive and\ninstantiated properties described above it seems possible to dissolve\nthis worry. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna differentiates between the property we\nsee as constituting an individual (such as roundness in the case of a\ncircle, treeness in the case of a tree etc.) and those properties that\nthe individual is then taken to instantiate (such as redness in the\ncase of the circle, and greenness in the case of the tree). As became\nevident in the discussion of motion where N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\nintroduces this distinction, the difference between constitutive and\ninstantiated properties is not regarded as bearing any ontological\nweight. It is rather a reflection of our epistemic priorities and\npractical concerns that we describe an object as a tree which is\ngreen, rather that as a green object which has the property of\ntreeness. As a consequence there is no fundamental ontological\ndifference between a substratum (dravya) and the qualities\n(gu\u1e47a) that inhere in it, contrary to the view\nthat is e.g. held by the Naiy\u0101yikas. (See the entry on\n Analytic Philosophy in Early Modern India\n (Navya-Ny\u0101ya).) When we speak of an individual having a property\nwe nominalize the predicate expressing the property we take to be\nconstitutive and ascribe the instantiating properties to the\nindividual thus created. There is, however, no deep ontological reason\nwhy we could not change our view of what the constitutive and what the\ninstantiating properties are, and thereby describe the very same\nsituation in terms of different individuals and properties. But if we\naccept this picture of ontology it is evident that we are not obliged\nto infer the existence of a substratum or underlying individual from\nthe existence of a quality. Of course the M\u0101dhyamika does not\ndeny that there are a variety of sensory and mental events that happen\nin close temporal and causal connection. But our ascription of these\nto a single self does not commit us to the existence of such a self at\nthe ontological level, any more than the ascription of redness to a\ncircle commits us to the existence of an individual \u2014 the circle\n\u2014 and the redness it instantiates. In the same way in which we\nselect one property, such as circularity, as constitutive and then\ngroup all the other properties around this new-found\n\u2018individual\u2019, in the same way we select certain properties\nof a causal nexus of sensory and mental events, some \u2018shifting\ncoalition of psycho-physical elements\u2019 and group the remainder\nof the properties around this new-found \u2018self\u2019. To speak\nof the self and its properties in terms of substratum and quality is\nperfectly acceptable, as long as we do not assume that such talk is\nbased on a distinction with an ontological grounding.\n\nAnother issue N\u0101g\u0101rjuna raises (in MMK 9:3) concerns the\nepistemic status of the self. A tension arises once we note that in\nits role as a unifier of our cognitive life a substantial self\nfeatures in all our experiences, as the subject having the\nexperiences, but at the same time, given the distinctness of such a\nself from our body and all parts of our mental life it must also be\ndistinct from all experiences. In order to have epistemic access to\nour self it must be able to function as a cognitive object. Since we\nassume, however, that it is not only a cognitive subject but also\nintrinsically a cognitive object it cannot ever occupy this role\n\u2014 at least if we make the plausible assumption that being an\nobject and being a subject are mutually incompatible properties. Now\ngiven that we do not seem to be able to acquire knowledge of the self\nby introspection or by observation of the outside world it appears\nthat the only cognitive route left open to us is inference. We have to\nestablish by an argument that the self exists. It might strike us as\nslightly curious that what seems to be the most intimate object of our\nacquaintance has to be known by a most indirect route. We might also\nconsider it as somewhat epistemically implausible to assume that\neverybody\u2019s belief in a self is arrived at by a process of\ndrawing inferences from a set of clues. One Ny\u0101ya argument for\nthe existence of the self based on the supposed existential dependence\nof qualities on a substratum has already been discussed above. The\nM\u0101dhyamika will be reluctant to accept it since he does not agree\nwith the Ny\u0101ya ontology of individuals and properties it\npresupposes. Other arguments would obviously have to be dealt with on\na case-by-case basis. But the M\u0101dhyamika will argue here that in\nfact no such argument is needed, since it is perfectly possible to\naccount for our self-awareness, as long as we give up the conception\nof a substantial self. If we conceive of the self as a temporally\nstretched-out compound of psychophysical events then there is no\nfundamental difficulty that the same type of event turns up on the\ncognizing subject side on one occasion, and on the cognized object\nside on another. Given that there is no unified substratum\nconstituting the self there is also no necessity for something to be\nessentially a subject of experience. As different parts can play\ndifferent roles at different times our self-knowledge can be just\nexplained by a momentary identification with a mental event that\npresently functions as a cognizing subject.\n\nGiven that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna rejects the picture of a substantial\nself described above we have to consider which alternative picture we\nare presented with instead. The self is obviously seen as depending on\nthe five constituents, which rules out the assumption that any\nindependently existent substance could be regarded as a self. The\nemerging view of the self is characterized by two main properties.\n\nFirstly it is to be regarded as a sequence of events that stand in\nclose temporal and causal relations. Physical processes cause sensory\nevents, which are then framed by concepts, used as the basis of\ndecisions, which give rise to actions, which in turn set physical\nprocesses in motion which cause new sensory events and so forth. The\nself is not seen as a cognitive nucleus which stays constant amidst\nthe stream of changing sensory impressions and mental deliberations,\nbut rather as the entire set of such sensory and mental events which\nare interconnected in complicated ways.\n\nNot only does the self depend for its existence on the constituents,\nbut the constituents only acquire their existence as distinct parts of\nthe stream of mental and physical events by being associated with a\nsingle self, which, regarded as a constitutive property, produces the\nbasis for postulating the individual in which the various properties\nof the self inhere. It is precisely this reason that keeps the\nM\u0101dhyamika from regarding the constituents as ultimate existents\n(dravya) and the self as merely imputed\n(praj\u00f1apti). For the M\u0101dhyamika not only is there\nno substantial self, there is also no substantial basis on which a\nnon-substantial self could be built.\n\nSecondly, the self is characterized by a mistaken self-awareness. This\nmeans that the self which is essentially a sequence of events does not\nregard itself in this way, but considers itself to be a substantial\nself, that is, an essentially unchanging unified agent distinct from\nits physical and mental properties. To this extent it is deluded about\nits real nature. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna therefore compares the agent to\nan illusion created in a magical performance that in turn brings about\nanother illusion (MMK 17:31\u201332). This construction allows him to\nreconcile his rejection of a substantial self as an essentially\nunchanging unifier of our mental live distinct from both its physical\nand mental attributes with the acceptance of the self as an agent who\nwill experience the results of his actions, an assumption which could\nnot be relinquished within the Buddhist worldview. This is a very\nimportant point, since the identification of the self with a causally\ninterlinked set of events might tempt us to throw out all prudential\nconsiderations for our future selves, as well as those for other\nselves. Since none of these have any ultimate existence we might think\nthat all actions connected with them in some way (that is all our\nconscious actions) are all equally insubstantial too, so that in the\nultimate analysis it does not make any difference how we act.\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna counters this view by distinguishing the view from\nthe inside of an illusion from the outside view. When we are dreaming\nand are not aware we are doing so we understandably prefer to leave a\nbuilding by using the stairs, rather than jumping out of the window.\nFor somebody who is not dreaming, however (and also for our later,\nwaking selves) it does not make any difference whether we jump or not\nsince at the ultimate level (from the point of view of the awakened\none) there is no fundamental difference between the two actions. This\ndoes not imply that whilst we are still under the thrall of the\nillusion we should leave all prudential and moral considerations\nbehind. On the contrary, as long as we are under the influence of the\nillusion we have to act in accordance with its laws, even if we might\nsuspect that it is an illusion. Unlike in the case of dreaming, where\nthe mere wondering whether we are dreaming sometimes allows us to see\nthrough the nature of the dream the mere suspicion that there is no\nsubstantial self is (unfortunately) not yet a realization of the\nemptiness of the self.\n3.4 Knowledge\n\nThe Indian philosophical tradition distinguishes a variety of\nepistemic instruments (pram\u0101\u1e47a) by which epistemic\nobjects (prameya) are accessed. Which epistemic instruments\nwere accepted and how their function is understood differs amongst\nphilosophical theories. In his discussion of epistemology\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna lists four such instruments: perception\n(pratyak\u1e63a), inference (anum\u0101na),\nrecognition of likeness (upam\u0101na), and testimony\n(\u0101gama). His primary concern is not a discussion of the\nnature and interrelation of these different epistemic instruments, but\nthe question of how to establish any particular set of such\ninstruments, whether it is the one just indicated or a different one.\nOnce we have agreed that the existence of epistemic objects is\nestablished by the epistemic instruments (as for example the existence\nof the desk in front of me is established by my perceptual abilities,\nin this case primarily non-defective vision) we then have to address\nthe further question of how to establish the instruments. How do we\nknow that these instruments are good guides to the objects out there\nin the world?\n\nThere are three different ways in which we can try to establish\nepistemic instruments. First of all we could regard them as\nestablished by mutual coherence. Secondly we could assume that the\nepistemic instruments justify themselves. We do not have to go beyond\nperception to realize that perception usually delivers an accurate\npicture of the world, but perception itself presents a faithful\nrepresentation of the world and of its own validity. Finally one could\nregard the epistemic instruments and objects as mutually establishing\neach other. The instruments establish an object by giving us epistemic\naccess to it. But we could also argue that the epistemic object in\nturn establishes the epistemic instruments. Given that we manage to\ninteract with the epistemic objects more or less successfully (as\nconfirmed by the evolutionary success of our species) there must be\nsomething amongst our cognitive means which gives us a relatively\naccurate account of the way things are. In this way epistemic success\nallows us to establish the means of knowledge via the objects\nsuccessfully cognized.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna does not devote a great deal of discussion of to\nthe first alternative, the establishment of the epistemic instruments\nby mutual coherence (for some discussion see Stoltz 2021:\n156\u2013157). The reason for this is that this is hardly a position\nhis realist Naiy\u0101yika opponent will want to adopt. There are,\nafter all, coherent fairy-tales. Let us therefore have a closer look\nat the other two alternatives, paying particular attention to whether\nthere is any way in which the epistemic objects and instruments could\nbe construed as having their nature intrinsically, that is, as\nexisting with svabh\u0101va.\n3.4.1 Are the epistemic instruments self-established?\n\nRegarding the epistemic instruments as self-established has the\nimmediate advantage of avoiding two difficulties. Firstly we get\naround the infinite regress of establishing the instruments by other\ninstruments, which then in turn need yet other instruments to\nestablish them, and so forth. Unlike other forms of infinite regress\nwhich N\u0101g\u0101rjuna accepts (such as an infinitely extended\nchain of causes and conditions) this regress is vicious, since the\nburden of proof is transferred in its entirety to the preceding stage,\nas an epistemic instrument would have to establish all the succeeding\nones. Secondly the self-establishment of the epistemic instruments\nallows the opponent to hold on to the assumption that everything\nknowable is established by such instruments. It might be attractive to\ngive up this assumption in order to escape the vicious regress, but\nthis then makes it necessary to give a special reason explaining why\nordinary objects are by established epistemic instruments, but not the\ninstruments themselves.\n\nDespite these advantages, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues, there are some\nserious problems with the assumption that the epistemic instruments\nare self-established. First of all, if an epistemic instrument, such\nas visual perception, was self-established it should be able to exist\nindependently of the existence of an object of vision. But if we then\nassume that it is an essential property of visual perception to see,\nvisual perception must be able to function as its own object, as\notherwise there might be no other object to be seen. This,\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna claims, then leads to a problem already\nencountered in his analysis of motion. The mover and the place being\nmoved over cannot exist simultaneously, since motion takes time;\nvision cannot see something that exists simultaneously with it (such\nas itself), since vision takes time too (MMK 3:2\u20133, see also\nGarfield 1995: 139\u2013139).\n\nSecondly, observing again that if the epistemic instruments are\nself-established they will be established independently of the objects\nknown, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues as follows. Assume that we wanted to\nchose those amongst all the different means of cognitive access to the\nworld that deliver accurate knowledge of the nature of the objects\nknown, that is, that qualify as epistemic instruments. We would select\nall those that have a specific internal quality. The possession of\nthis quality would then guarantee that its possessor delivered\naccurate information about the nature of the objects cognized. But how\nis the connection between the specific internal quality and the\ncorrect representation of the object justified? After all there are\nall sorts of properties our means of cognitive access to the world can\nhave, so how do we know that a specific one is a guide to accurate\nrepresentation?\n\nSuppose we are presented with a set of fancy mechanical devices and\nare asked to select the five best tin openers from these. No detailed\nstudy of the internal properties of each will allow us to accomplish\nthat task. We have to analyse each in relation to a tin and try to\ndetermine the way in which it might open it. Only then would we be\nable to conclude which particular properties of the mechanisms are\ncorrelated with good tin-opening abilities. In the same way we can\nonly regard an internal quality of a way of accessing the world as a\ncharacteristic of an epistemic instrument once we have assessed it in\nrelation to the objects cognized. Only then can we conclude that this\nparticular property really leads us to the knowledge of the nature of\nthe object, rather than doing something else. But in this case the\nestablishment of the epistemic instruments can no longer be regarded\nas self-establishment since it incorporates reference to other objects\n(namely the objects known) at an essential place.\n3.4.2 Do the epistemic instruments and objects establish each other?\n\nIf the argument for the self-establishment of the epistemic\ninstruments is not successful, the remaining option is to argue that\nthe instruments and objects mutually establish one another. Assume\nthat I see an apple on the table. The existence of the apple, the\nepistemic object, is established by the epistemic instrument which is\nperception. But we could equally argue the other way round: that the\nobject known establishes the epistemic instrument. This would invite\nthe immediate objection that we then need prior cognitive access to\nthe object known, and if we have this we must already have established\nthe epistemic instrument. We are therefore pointlessly establishing it\ntwice. But if we somehow gain this access without relying on the\nepistemic instruments the whole project of establishing these\ninstruments seems futile, since it is precisely the justification of\nour instruments used in gaining knowledge of the world that we have\nset out to scrutinize. We will therefore need a different\nargumentative strategy to argue for the mutual establishment of\nobjects known and epistemic instruments, and in particular for the\nestablishment of the latter by the former. One way of going about this\n(which does not commit us to the viciously circular mutual\nestablishment criticized by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna) is to argue that\nbecause the epistemic object is perceived, there must be something\nbringing about such a perception, and this is the epistemic\ninstrument. In this case the apple establishes the existence of the\nepistemic instrument by which it is known. An essential prerequisite\nfor this latter direction of establishment is of course success.\nBecause we successfully apprehend an apple our means of apprehension\nis regarded as an epistemic instrument. If we were susceptible to\nfrequent apple-hallucinations that disappeared once we tried to touch\nthem we would not regard perception as a reliable apple-detector, that\nis, as an epistemic instrument. But since we are generally successful\nin our cognitive interactions with the world and normally only\nperceive the existence of apples that are indeed there the very fact\nthat we successfully apprehend a world of outside objects serves as an\nargument for regarding the successful means of apprehension as\nepistemic instruments. An immediate difficulty with this procedure is\nthat we also need an epistemic instrument for establishing the success\nof our cognitive actions, that is to ascertain whether we really are\nperceiving the apple or just an apple-hallucination.\n\nNothing seems to rule out that some epistemic instrument first\ndeceives us about what we see, and later deceives us about the outcome\nof whatever procedure we use to establish whether the first cognition\nwas successful. But this need not rule out any attempts of mutually\nestablishing the epistemic instruments and objects if we do not use\nepistemically suspect procedures (which we know to have lead to\nunsuccessful cognitions in the past) to establish the success of our\ncognitive actions. A more worrying question is whether the mutual\nestablishment of instruments and objects \u2013 if successful \u2013\nactually delivers the account of epistemic instruments\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s opponent wants to defend. In order to see\nthis we have to note first that the notion of \u2018successful\ncognitive apprehension\u2019 referred to above cannot just be an act\nof cognition that leads to a successful action, as many of our\ncognitions (and many of the beliefs subsequently acquired) are never\nacted upon. We therefore also have to include coherence with other\ncognitions or beliefs as a criterion for the success of some epistemic\ninstruments as well. Our cognition of the apple on the table might\ntherefore be deemed successful if it either leads to a successful\naction (we reach out, grasp the apple, and eat it) or if it coheres\nwith other epistemic instruments (for example with my memory of buying\na bag of apples and putting them on the table). However, the\ndifficulty with employing coherence in this way is that we have to\nselect a certain set of cognitions or beliefs that we hold fixed, so\nthat we can then evaluate the status of other cognitions relative to\nthem. One problem now is of course how to assure the accuracy of this\nselected set: if they are not accurate themselves coherence with them\nhas very little argumentative weight.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s account of epistemology is supposed to\nfulfill a purpose both at the object- as well as at the meta-level. At\nthe object-level epistemic instruments and objects are just another\nset of central concepts that have to be investigated as entities\npotentially existing with svabh\u0101va. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\nargues that the various ways in which the epistemic instruments and\nobjects could be established are either not satisfactory or fail to\nshow that they exist with svabh\u0101va. At the meta-level\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s theory of epistemology is supposed to\nprovide the theoretical background of his own account of emptiness. As\nthe theory of emptiness is something we are supposed to acquire\nknowledge of it is essential to get clear about the means by which we\nare supposed to do so, and indeed about what our epistemic object\nconsists of in this case. These two projects are inherently\ninterconnected. For according to the standard Ny\u0101ya theory of\nepistemology N\u0101g\u0101rjuna encountered, knowledge is acquired by\nusing a set of procedures (such as perception or inference) the nature\nof which it is to produce knowledge and which convey information about\na set of objective, mind-independent set of individuals that are the\nbearers of specific qualities. But a theory that thus presupposes the\nexistence of objects of knowledge with distinct natures which the\nmeans of knowledge could adequately represent could hardly be used as\na basis for knowing emptiness, for it presupposes exactly what the\ntheory of emptiness denies. A substantial part of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s epistemological discussion is therefore\ndedicated to a criticism of the standard Ny\u0101ya theory of\nknowledge. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna sets out to establish that nothing can\nbe regarded as intrinsically an epistemic instrument or object. The\ntwo have to be mutually established: the instrument establishes the\nobject by giving us cognitive access to it, our successful interaction\nwith the object establishes the instrument as a trustworthy route to\nthe object. Something will therefore be classified as an epistemic\ninstrument or object not because this is a reflection of its intrinsic\nnature, but because it is regarded as such once a reflective\nequilibrium has been reached. We use beliefs about the nature of the\nobject in order to test our hypotheses concerning the instruments of\nacquiring such beliefs, these hypotheses are then in turn used to\nassess our view of the nature of the object. Such mutual establishment\nof epistemic instruments and epistemic objects then also entails that\nneither of them can exist by svabh\u0101va.\n3.5 Language and truth\n\nLanguage is not a topic that is given much explicit discussion in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s works. This does not mean that such\nmatters were not important to him, but merely that his extant writings\ndo not contain an extended connected discussion of the impact of his\ntheory of emptiness on his view of language.\n\nNevertheless it is possible to extract some of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s views on this philosophically highly\ninteresting issue from remarks found at different places in his\nworks.\n\nMost importantly it is apparent that the Madhyamaka theory of\nemptiness is not compatible with a the idea of a \u2018ready-made\nworld\u2019, that is of a world that exists independently of human\ninterests and concerns and already shows a particular kind of\nstructuring that our structured language could then set out to\nreflect. If nothing exists with svabh\u0101va nothing in the\nworld could exist from its own side and nothing could bear a structure\nthat is intrinsic to it, rather than something ascribed to it from the\noutside. Moreover, the M\u0101dhyamika will reject the classic\ncorrespondence theory of truth, according to which the truth of a\nstatement is grounded in the identity of structure between a statement\nand the bit of the world it refers to. This also entails a rejection\nof the associated view of how language works, namely that our\nsentences manage to connect up with the world via a set of objectively\nexistent structural similarities. The main reason for this rejection\nis that the M\u0101dhyamika cannot find any sufficiently substantial\nrelation that would allow us to bind together world and word at the\nmost fundamental level. The most plausible candidate for linking words\nand their referents is the causal relation, for example by using it to\nconstruct a causal chain from an \u2018initial baptism\u2019 to our\npresent use of the term. But as we have seen, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna has\nargued that the causal relation itself is conceptually constructed. If\ncausation cannot be regarded as a relation that functions objectively,\nindependent of the concepts we employ then it can hardly be regarded\nas a mind-independent way of grounding the relationship between\nlanguage and the world.\n\nAn alternative account which the M\u0101dhyamika might want to adopt\nis one which does not conceive of truth in terms of correspondence\nwith an exterior reality but rather in terms of assertability\nconditions. In this case a statement is regarded as true if conditions\nobtain that warrant our asserting the statement. What makes the\nstatement that water is wet true is not a structural correspondence\nbetween it and a state of affairs involving water, but that we have\nsomething that justifies us in making this statement. What this\njustification consists in depends on the further details of our theory\nof truth; it might be based on facts about empirical observation,\nabout coherence with other beliefs, about pragmatic success and so\nforth. This view of course implies that there could not be any truths\nthat are in principle beyond our ability to know them. This is because\nwe could never have a warrant for asserting such statements, and the\nexistence of such a warrant is precisely what we consider the truth of\nthe statements to consist in. Such statements would have to be\nregarded as lacking a truth-value. This kind of denial of\nverification-transcendent truths in turn agrees very well with\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s contextualist epistemology. For if nothing\nis intrinsically an epistemic instrument nothing can be intrinsically\nbeyond the grasp of such instruments either. As what constitutes an\nepistemic instrument is context-dependent, that a certain truth cannot\nbe accessed by some instrument is context-dependent too. There is no\ncontext-independent concept of knowledge we could use to form the idea\nof a truth that lies beyond all epistemic contexts.\n\nAccording to the Madhyamaka view of truth there can be no such thing\nas ultimate truth, a theory describing how things really are,\nindependent of our interests and conceptual resources employed in\ndescribing it. All one is left with is conventional truth, truth which\nconsists in agreement with commonly accepted practices and\nconventions. These are the truths that are arrived at when viewing the\nworld through our linguistically formed conceptual framework. But we\nshould be wary of denigrating these conventions as a distorting device\nthat incorporates our specific interests and concerns. The very notion\nof \u2018distortion\u2019 presupposes that there is a world\nuntainted by conceptuality out there (even if our minds can never\nreach it) that is twisted and bent to fit our cognitive grasp. But the\nvery notion of such a \u2018way things really are\u2019 is argued by\nthe M\u0101dhyamika to be incoherent. There is no way of investigating\nthe world apart from our linguistic and conceptual practices, if only\nbecause these practices generate the notion of the \u2018world\u2019\nand of the \u2018objects\u2019 in it in the first place. To speak of\nconventional reality as distorted is therefore highly misleading,\nunless all we want to say is that our way of investigating the world\nis inextricably bound up with the linguistic and conceptual framework\nwe happen to employ.\n\nThere are two worries one might have about the rejection of the notion\nof an ultimate truth. First of all one might think that progress in\nhuman inquiry makes it necessary that we question what we now believe\nto be truths and perhaps replace them with other beliefs. Even a\ncursory acquaintance with the history of science will show that we are\nwhere we are now only through a persistent process of replacing\nbeliefs we once held to be true, but no longer hold to be true. But it\nseems hard to explain what our justification for this is if it is not\ntrying to bring our beliefs into greater accordance with the way\nthings are. All we ever seem to be dealing with according to the\nMadhyamaka view is a purely immanent notion of truth where the only\nkind of truth we have access to is a reflection of conventional human\npractices and agreements. In response to this the M\u0101dhyamika\nmight want to make the point that it is at least sometimes\nadvantageous to treat truths as if they had a more than\nconventional grounding, that is as if they were not just the\nproduct of agreement with commonly accepted practices and conventions.\nThis is precisely because such practices need improvement from time to\ntime, and since a spirit of inquiry is facilitated better by the idea\nthat there is a mind-independent truth waiting to be discovered. The\nM\u0101dhyamika could thus argue that for pragmatic reasons we should\nconceive of truths as reflections of an objective, external reality\neven though we do not think that there are any such truths in fact. We\nmight object at this point that if the notion of the existence of at\nleast some verification-transcendent truths is pragmatically useful,\nwhoever believes in truth as warranted assertability then has to\nbelieve that some truths are not conventional, since asserting this is\nnow supported by a warrant. But this will not just turn the\nanti-realist into a realist against his will, since his embracing of\nnon-conventional truths is dictated by purely practical concerns: we\nare considerably better off if we build our inquiries on the\nconvenient fiction of non-conventional truths. But they remain just\nthat, namely convenient fictions; the anti-realist does not think, as\nthe realist does, that the existence of such truths is in any way\ngrounded by the way the world is independent of our interests and\nconcerns.\n\nAnother worry with the M\u0101dhyamika\u2019s rejection of an\nultimate truth is that emptiness cannot then be regarded as the\nultimate truth either. But surely, one will argue, for the\nM\u0101dhyamika emptiness is the end-product of the correct analysis\nof phenomena, and thereby indicative of the way things really are.\nHowever, emptiness is not to be understood as a description of reality\nas it is independent of human conceptual conventions, as its main\npurpose it to combat the wrong ascription of svabh\u0101va to\nthings. The absence of svabh\u0101va or emptiness is nothing\nphenomena have within themselves, but only something which is\nprojected onto them from the outside in an attempt to rectify a\nmistaken cognition. Therefore the theory of emptiness is not to be\nregarded as an ultimately true theory either. Such a theory would\ndescribe things as they are independent of human interests and\nconcerns. But the theory of emptiness is intricately bound up with\nsuch interests and concerns: if there were no human minds who\nmistakenly read the existence of svabh\u0101va into phenomena\nwhich lack it there would be no point in having a theory to correct\nthis. It is only due to our erroneous view of things that the theory\nof emptiness is required as a corrective.\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe preceding discussion has discussed some of the main topics\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna addresses in order to refute their existence by\nsvabh\u0101va: causation, change, the self, knowledge,\nlanguage, and truth. This is not a comprehensive exposition of the\nMadhyamaka view, however, not just because there are aspects of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s thought we have not mentioned here (such\nhas his discussion of time and his account of ethics), but because\nMadhyamaka thought regards itself as a philosophical antidote against\nsuperimpositions of svabh\u0101va wherever they arise. It is\ntherefore by necessity more comprehensive than the arguments found in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s works. They provide examples of\nargumentative procedures and discussions of putative examples of\nsvabh\u0101va prominent amongst N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nopponents. But the Madhyamaka project consists not just in the\nexplanation and defense of these arguments (even though most of the\npositions N\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues against are of more than\nhistorical importance) but has to be continued in the debate with the\ndefenders of svabh\u0101va in the contemporary philosophical\ndiscussion. It is apparent that Madhyamaka philosophy is opposed to\nthe brand of realism currently found in much of contemporary analytic\nphilosophy (Michael Devitt (1997: 41) characterizes this succinctly as\nthe claim that \u2018most current common-sense and scientific\nphysical existence statements are objectively and mind-independently\n(deflationary) true\u2019). Things that exist in a mind-independent\nmanner exist with svabh\u0101va, even though they might be\ndependent in all other kinds of ways. (Even if everything out there\ndepended on every other thing, as long as the entire network of\ndependence-relations was mind-independent it would exist with\nsvabh\u0101va). Of course the M\u0101dhyamika\u2019s talk of\n\u201cmind-dependence\u201d does not refer to dependence on any\nindividual mind, as a solipsist would assume, but to collective\ndependence on all the minds there are. This view raises a variety of\ninteresting questions that Madhyamaka philosophy has to address.\n\nFirst of all there is the question of how to make sense of objects\nlike Mt Everest depending on all our minds collectively. It is clear\nhow we could say something like this about things existing merely by\nthe force of convention, such as some objects traded on the stock\nmarket. But how could something like a mountain be merely\nconventionally existent?\n\nSecondly, given the Madhyamaka rejection of a correspondence-theoretic\naccount of truth, how can it come up with a theory of meaning and\ntruth that is not committed to some sort of structural isomorphism\nbetween word and world but still gives us a robust account of what\ndistinguishes true from false sentences?\n\nThirdly, if it is not facts out there that settle what is true how can\nthe M\u0101dhyamika avoid the unacceptable relativistic conclusion\nthat we cannot criticize epistemic or ethical practices which differ\nfrom ours?\n\nFourthly, how can we make sense of an ontology without foundations in\nwhich there are no substantially existent objects on which everything\nelse depends? (For an interesting formal model of such an ontology see\nPriest 2009, 2014. This question has obvious systematics connections\nwith the current discussion of\n grounding.)\n\nMany aspects of these questions have been addressed in vast body of\ncommentarial literature that was written in the nearly two millennia\nsince N\u0101g\u0101rjuna composed his key philosophical works. Other\nstill remain to be addressed. (For some development of contemporary\nMadhyamaka ideas in relation to contemporary Western philosophy see\nGarfield 2015, Westerhoff 2020.) One of these is the question to which\nextent Madhyamaka thought is essentially linked to Buddhism. This is a\nquestion that has attracted more interest recently especially from\nresearchers that study Madhyamaka primarily as a philosophical, rather\nthan as a religious tradition. (For some interesting reflections on\nmatter this see McGuire 2017). If we consider the lively status of\nMadhyamaka studies today it seems evident that the questions\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna asked and the system of philosophy he founded in\nthe second century remain very much alive in the twenty-first.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<p>\n[NB.
