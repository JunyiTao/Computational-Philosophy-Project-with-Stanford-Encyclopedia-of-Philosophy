    "main_text": "Disability and Health\n2. Disability and Health\n\nPeople appear to regard health as one of the most important goods,\nmore important than wealth, status, or professional success. Health is\nseen as special in part for instrumental reasons, because it is\nthought to be a prerequisite for many or most other goods. So the\nrelationship of health to disability is an issue of central concern\nfor those who seek to replace or supplement a medical model of\ndisability (Bickenbach 1993; Shakespeare 2006).\n\nThe social model of disability, which informs the Americans with\nDisabilities Act and kindred legislation, may appear to move\ndisability away from health policy and toward civil rights. Yet\nmovement in one direction does not preclude movement in the other.\nPeople with disabilities have significant health care needs, and their\nneeds may depend to some extent upon their disabilities. For\nphilosophers as well as policy makers, the challenge posed by the\nsocial model is to acknowledge the importance of health and health\ncare for people with disabilities without assuming that all people\nwith disabilities are unhealthy just because they are disabled, and\nwithout overemphasizing the correction or mitigation of impairments.\nThis requires a careful examination of the relationship between health\nand disability. Do all disabilities result from, or in, a loss of\nhealth? Can a person with a disability be in good or even\n\u201cperfect\u201d health? To answer such questions, we need a\nserviceable theory, concept, or definition of health.\n\nThere are a variety of competing philosophical accounts of health (see\n SEP entry on concepts of health and disease).\n They can be distinguished in several ways: 1) some regard health as\nthe mere absence of disease (e.g., Hofman 2005); others regard health\nas a form of well-being or flourishing, and treat the absence of\ndisease as at most a necessary condition of health (e.g., Carel 2007\nand WHO 1948); 2) some regard the concept of health as value-laden, or\nnormative, in the sense that the good of health enters into its very\nconcept (e.g., Engelhardt 1986; DeVito 2000); others regard health as\nvalue-neutral, or non-normative, defined by bio-statistical or other\nbiological criteria (e.g., Boorse 1987 and Wachbroit 1998); 3) some\nsee the value of health as instrumental, in the capacity of the agent\nor organism to achieve certain goals (e.g., Nordenfeldt 1995); others\nsee its value as intrinsic as well, as good in itself (e.g., Becker\n2005).\n\nThese distinctions are not independent of each other. Non-normative\naccounts of health tend to treat health as the absence of disease,\ndysfunction, or deformity. These accounts also tend to be\ninstrumental: they define health as normal or species-typical\nbiological functioning, which is itself defined in such goal-oriented\nterms as survival and reproduction. On the other hand, instrumental\naccounts that define health in terms of the pursuit of an\nindividually, culturally, or other variable range of goals will tend\nto weaken the connection of health to bodily, cognitive, or affective\nfunctioning.\n\nIf health is defined simply as the absence of disease, then a person\ncan be disabled but healthy if and only if he can be disabled but not\ndiseased. If, however, health is a state of psychophysical flourishing\nor vitality, then an individual can be healthy, although perhaps not\nperfectly healthy, even if disabled or diseased, and unhealthy even if\nfree of disability or disease.\n\nMany philosophers and bioethicists take it that \u201chealth\u201d,\n\u201cdisease\u201d, and \u201cdisability\u201d are value-laden,\nthat it is part of their meaning that the conditions to which they\nrefer are (inherently) desirable or undesirable (e.g., Engelhardt 1986\nand DeVito 2000). Two notable exceptions are Christopher Boorse and\nRobert Wachbroit, who offer biomedical definitions that are\nvalue-neutral, or as Boorse claims, as value-neutral as biology itself\n(Boorse 1987: 359\u201393; Wachbroit 1998: 533\u201338). They define\nhealth in terms of normal or species-typical physical and mental\nfunctioning, so that disabilities are by definition unhealthy. But\nsuch value-neutral accounts do not assume that disabilities are\ntherefore bad or undesirable, merely\n atypical.[2]\n\nSince they deny that the goodness of health is part of its definition,\nvalue-neutral accounts stress the enormous, but contingent,\ninstrumental value of health. The leading attempt to explain the\nimportance of health in these terms is Daniels\u2019 account of\nhealth-care as maintaining or restoring fair equality of opportunity\n(Daniels 1985). Daniels\u2019 account gives a priority to the\nmaintenance of typical functioning and the correction of disabilities\nthat many critics find excessive (Wasserman 1998: 152\u201358).\nStill, the core intuition, concerning the enormous practical value of\nspecies-typical functioning, can be accepted without accepting medical\nnormalization as the preferred or default response to atypicality;\nindeed, without accepting the claim that species have functions with\nspecies- typical levels defined in biological terms (see Amundson\n2000). Further, the claim that species-typical functioning is\ninstrumentally valuable leaves open the question of why\ndepartures from species-typical functioning are instrumentally\ndisvaluable: is it because they render one vulnerable to\ndiscrimination, subject one to an unaccommodating environment, cause\nmedical problems, or all of the above?\n\nYet most people have a strong conviction that practical advantages do\nnot exhaust the value of health, nor practical disadvantages its\ndisvalue. To accommodate this conviction, those accepting a narrow\ndefinition of health as the absence of disease may want to acknowledge\nthat disease, or its usual symptoms or consequences, has inherent\ndisvalue, while distinguishing disability from the other symptoms or\nconsequences of disease, particularly pain and death. Those adopting a\nbroader definition of health as an aspect of well-being or flourishing\nmay also want to claim that being unhealthy has inherent disvalue,\nwhile distinguishing disability from a lack of health.\n",
