Introduction\n\nBefore proceeding to a consideration of Japanese Pure Land Buddhist\nthought, it may be useful to note two intertwined difficulties that it\npresents for modern Western readers in particular: an extensive\nscriptural and commentarial tradition, and apparent resemblances to\nfamiliar forms of Christian thought.\n1.1 The Scriptural and Commentarial Tradition\n\nThe Pure Land teachings are often regarded as popularized, devotional\nextensions of a more philosophically demanding contemplative tradition\nbased on a core doctrine of emptiness or voidness. In fact, the\nconcepts of multitudes of celestial buddhas and their buddha-fields\nthroughout the cosmos are already in evidence in the earliest strata\nof extant texts produced by the Mahayana movement, and sutras\nexpounding distant buddha-fields, such as that of Ak\u1e63obhya\nBuddha in the east, are among the first to be translated into Chinese\nalready in the second century CE, with sutras teaching Amida Buddha\nsoon to follow. Thus, sutras teaching methods of achieving liberation\nfrom samsaric existence through attaining birth in buddha-fields in\nother regions of the cosmos\u2014particularly Amida Buddha\u2019s\nPure Land\u2014were among the earliest Buddhist scriptures\ntransmitted to China. Further, the teaching of birth into\nAmida\u2019s buddha-field became the focus of a continuous\ncommentarial tradition that began among such major Indian Mahayana\nthinkers as N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (c. 150\u2013250) and Vasubandhu (c.\n320\u2013400) in India, was transmitted to China as early as the\nthird century CE, and is maintained today in Japan. Thus, it may be\nsaid that Pure Land concepts and ideas emerged directly out of\nelemental strains of Mahayana Buddhist thought at an early stage and\nunderwent continual development in East Asia.\n\nThe Pure Land path based on Amida is expounded in the Larger\nand Smaller Sutras of the Adornments of [the Buddha-field\nNamed] Bliss\n(Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha-s\u016btra), which trace their\norigins back to northwestern India in about the first century CE, the\nperiod of the redaction of the\nPraj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 in 8000 Lines,\nGarland, Lotus, Vimalak\u012brti, and other\nmajor Mahayana sutras. These two sutras, along with the later\nSutra of Contemplation on the Buddha of Immeasurable Life\n(Jp. Kanmury\u014djuky\u014d), form the foundation for the\nEast Asian Pure Land tradition.\n\nThe Larger Sutra is the only extant sutra that relates the\nnarrative of how the bodhisattva Dharma-Storehouse (Dharm\u0101kara)\nestablished and fulfilled vows to become Amida (\u201cimmeasurable\n[light and life]\u201d), the buddha of compassion who leads all\nbeings to enlightenment by enabling them to be born into his\nbuddha-field. It was first translated into Chinese in the third\ncentury and was reputedly retranslated eleven more times over the\nfollowing seven hundred years, attesting to its enduring importance in\nChinese Buddhist tradition. The Pure Land tradition developed for over\na thousand years in China, accumulating an extensive body of\nscriptural and commentarial writings, before undergoing the radical\nreinterpretation in Japan that Suzuki refers to.\n\nThus, the Pure Land Buddhist heritage in Japan stands today upon the\nselective use of a continuous textual tradition stretching back nearly\ntwo millennia. Terms from the Chinese of the sutras in their various\nrenditions and evolving commentaries on the Pure Land path became the\nstandard medium of Pure Land Buddhist discourse in Japan, so that a\nfull grasp of the Japanese tradition requires familiarity with these\nterms, their relationship to the broader Buddhist tradition, and the\nhistorical changes in their understandings and emphases in the course\nof their long development in various cultural spheres and sectarian\nsettings. Japanese Buddhists have been, throughout their history,\nfully aware of their geographical position at the easternmost reach of\nthe spread of Buddhism in Asia and of their indebtedness to the\ntransmission of Buddhist tradition across the various ethnic locales\nand political boundaries of the Asian continent.\n1.2 Comparative Frameworks\n\nA further difficulty in grasping Japanese Pure Land thought involves\nthe pitfalls of a comparative approach in relation to Western\nreligious traditions. When, for his own polemical purposes, Karl Barth\n(1886\u20131968) surveyed the religious traditions of the world in\nsearch of doctrinal parallels to Christianity, he concluded that it\nwas the Japanese Pure Land tradition that provided \u201cthe most\nexact, comprehensive, and plausible \u2018pagan\u2019 parallel to\nChristianity\u201d (Barth 1961, 1,2: 342). He expresses some shock at\nthe depth and specificity of resemblance, commenting that the Pure\nLand thought of H\u014dnen (1133\u20131212) and Shinran\n(1173\u20131263) in particular\n\n\nparallels not so much Roman or Greek Catholicism but rather of all\nthings the Christianity of the Reformation, and therefore\nconfronts Christianity with the question of its truth precisely in its\nform as a consistent religion of grace. (Barth 1961, 1,2:\n342; for a discussion on Barth\u2019s comparative comments, see\nHirota 2000a, especially pp. 35\u201338)\n\n\nBarth insightfully discusses specific doctrinal analogues in a long\nnote in Church Dogmatics, and these parallels have indeed\ntended to form the foundations for the understanding of Japanese Pure\nLand Buddhism in much of Western scholarly literature. Unfortunately,\nto the extent that Pure Land Buddhism has seemed to resemble\nProtestant Christianity, it has also been assumed to be divorced from\n\u201cgenuine\u201d or \u201coriginal\u201d Mahayana Buddhist\nthought and practices and devoid of any intellectual interest. Any\ncomparative considerations of Japanese Pure Land Buddhist thought,\ntherefore, require caution, even in the face of seemingly evident\nresemblance.\n1.3 A Japanese Pure Land Philosophy\n\nAs mentioned before, the Pure Land Buddhist teachings have taken on a\nhighly distinctive shape in Japan, generating new determinations of\nthe central canonical texts and multiple strands of scholastic and\ncommentarial tradition. It is in relation to these latter developments\nthat we can best speak of a specifically \u201cJapanese Pure Land\nBuddhist philosophy,\u201d for the creative construals of a\npracticable Buddhist path to transformed awareness involved, in the\nforces for their evolution and in the articulation of their\nimplications, deliberation on such matters as the nature of human\nexistence, self and other, language, reality, and truth. Further, the\ndisparate streams of Japanese Pure Land thought stand as distinctive\nunderstandings, often employing their own characteristic terminology,\nof an already highly evolved Buddhist tradition, and a grasp of them\noften requires a recognition of the tensions between received\ntradition and reinterpretation that they manifest.\n\nIn order to treat Pure Land Buddhist tradition while keeping within\nthe parameters of \u201cJapan\u201d and \u201cphilosophy,\u201d\nthis entry will divide the discussion into three sections. In the\nfirst, there is a brief sketch of several broad trajectories of\nthought that stem from central Mahayana concerns and that shape the\nPure Land outlook, coming to hold particular significance in the\nJapanese Pure Land tradition. The second section identifies the\ncentral issues involved in H\u014dnen\u2019s seminal reformulation of\nthe Pure Land path. The third section will then treat several\nfundamental philosophical issues in Japanese Pure Land thought,\nfocusing upon Pure Land thought as one distinctive stream of a path to\nreligious awakening within the Mahayana traditions of praxis, and\nfurther upon the major developments that occurred specifically in\nJapan. The point will not be to suggest that medieval Japanese\nthinkers speak directly to Western philosophical issues, but rather to\ninvestigate how their thinking might be understood to take up topics\ncommonly considered philosophical in Western intellectual tradition\nand to illuminate perspectives relevant to current intellectual\nconcerns.\n2. Contours of Pure Land Buddhist Thought\n\nTwo fundamental elements of early Mahayana practice contributed\nsignificantly to the development of the Pure Land path. First, the\nanimating force that initially gave rise to the Mahayana movement as a\nwhole\u2014the critical reflection on obdurate self-attachment that\nattended even religious endeavor\u2014was pursued to a culmination in\nPure Land aspiration. Second, the Mahayana movement\u2019s\nformulation of genuine practice as the career of the\nbodhisattva-practitioner provided the principal framework and symbols\nfor the articulation of Pure Land practice. In particular, the stage\nin the bodhisattva\u2019s progress of nonretrogression from perfect\nenlightenment, which was regarded as holding decisive significance,\nserved to shape the Pure Land path by becoming its goal.\n2.1 Critical Self-Reflection\n\nMahayana tradition appears to have arisen when, around the beginning\nof the common era, groups of Buddhists emerged who, reflecting on\ntheir own experience in practice, assumed a critical stance toward the\nimmediately preceding tradition. They viewed the existing institutions\nas having declined, during five centuries of transmission since the\ntime of the Buddha, into monastic formalism and scholasticism,\nsectarian disputation, and an erroneous notion of the nature of the\nwisdom that was the aim of Buddhist practice. They declared that the\nestablished view of training, directed to merely personal emancipation\nfrom painful existence, was narrow and finally inadequate, and that in\ntheir aspiration to attain the actual realization \u015a\u0101kyamuni\nhad transmitted, they had sought and discovered a method by which\ngenuine attainment was possible. They called this new path the\n\u201cgreat vehicle\u201d (Mahayana), because it holds as its goal\nthe attainment of authentic enlightenment by all beings, and asserted\nthat it was superior to the existing institutions, which they labeled\nthe \u201clesser vehicle\u201d (Hinayana).\n\nAccording to Mahayanists, the Hinayana sages withdrew from ordinary\nlife in society and performed practices and disciplines, seeking their\nown extinction of passions and emancipation from samsaric existence by\nrealizing the nonsubstantiality of their own person\u2014the fact\nthat the ego-self is no more than a delusional construct. Mahayana\nBuddhists asserted that such praxis did not free practitioners from a\nfinal residue of self-attachment manifested in the desertion of the\nbeings of samsara in favor of personal liberation and in an attachment\nto the goal of nirvana itself. Instead, the Mahayanists taught the\nthorough relinquishment of all attachments through the realization or\n\u201cseeing\u201d of the nonsubstantiality or emptiness that\npervades not only the self, but all things and all persons. Such\nseeing is established by eradicating the discriminative thinking\narising from the perspective of the reified, delusional self. One thus\ntranscends even the dichotomies of self and other, blind passions and\nenlightenment, and samsara and nirvana, and realizes nondiscriminative\nwisdom that \u201csees suchness\u201d or things just as they are.\nHere, practice to attain enlightenment oneself and to liberate all\nbeings is understood to be one.\n\nThe rigorous scrutiny of even religious praxis for vestiges of\nself-attachment and discriminative thinking, which informed the\norigins of the Mahayana movement, also provided impetus for its\ndevelopment as the Pure Land path.\n2.2 Seeds of Pure Land Thought in the Bodhisattva Path\n\nThe path of realization based on the Mahayana conception of genuine\nwisdom was elaborated as the career of the bodhisattva. As described\nin Mahayana sutras, it begins with the profound awakening of the mind\naspiring for enlightenment (bodhicitta), the determination to\nbecome a buddha whatever hardships one may encounter over the course\nof many lifetimes of endeavor. This unshakable resolution is declared\nin the presence of a buddha in formal vows, and typically, the\nbodhisattva receives from the buddha a prophesy foretelling eventual\nfulfillment of those vows. A standard element of such individual vows\nis the establishment, through their vast accumulation of merit through\npraxis, of a buddha land or field of influence\n(buddhak\u1e63etra), which is understood as giving concrete\nmanifestation both to the splendor of their attainment and to their\nactivity to bring beings to enlightenment.\n\nThe bodhisattva then embarks upon the practices and disciplines, to be\ncontinued through countless lifetimes, that will finally result in\nfulfillment. It is said that vast aeons\u2014\u201cthree great\ninnumerable kalpas\u201d\u2014are required for the completion of a\nbodhisattva\u2019s practices (the inconceivable stretches of time may\nbe understood as expressing the depths of a being\u2019s evil karma\nto be eradicated and the preciousness of enlightenment). The process\nof practice has been formulated in a scheme of ten stages, in which\nthe most crucial is the stage of nonretrogression, the first (or in\nsome formats, the seventh). While prior to reaching this stage, they\nwill fall back into samsaric existence if they discontinue their\npractice, once they have attained nonretrogression through stilling\ntheir discriminative thought and seeing suchness, they will never\nregress but steadily advance in their practice to supreme\nawakening.\n\nAlthough Pure Land Buddhism is sometimes understood to teach a\nparadisial afterlife, in fact it developed as a method for achieving\nnonretrogression, one that provided an alternative to the arduous\nendeavor through numerous lifetimes required for reaching this stage\nin the earlier formulations of the bodhisattva path. As practitioners\nfound themselves without enlightened guidance in a world increasingly\ndistant from the benign influence of a buddha\u2019s presence, the\nobstacles to successful practice loomed ever larger and practitioners\ncame to seek a practicable way to advance. The possibility of entrance\ninto an environment that would support one\u2019s efforts in\nbodhisattva practices emerged, and on the basis of the Pure Land\nsutras, the concepts of the bodhisattva path were recast to render a\nnew understanding of the nature of practice.\n2.3 Merit Transference\n\nThere are several aspects of the bodhisattva\u2019s career of\nparticular note when approaching Pure Land Buddhist thought. First, an\nessential element of the bodhisattva path is the transference to other\nbeings of the merit that accrues from performance of praxis. All\nBuddhists have accepted that, by the principle of karmic causation,\ngood acts hold the power to counteract the effects of evil deeds and\nlead to better conditions in the next birth. In the earlier Buddhism,\nit was generally assumed that only one\u2019s own thoughts and acts\ncould exert their influence on one\u2019s future conditions, although\nthe evidence of inscriptions suggests that sharing merit with\none\u2019s parents or teacher was also recognized. In the Mahayana\ntradition, however, bodhisattvas perform good acts and practices for\nlong aeons and thus accumulate vast stores of merit, but their\npractice is invariably undertaken with the liberation of all beings\nforemost in their minds. Thus, their merit is always freely and\nselflessly given to beings in samsaric existence. This concept of\ngiving or transferring merit (Jp. ek\u014d) is a direct\nexpression of the nature of bodhisattvas, for they undertake their\npractice in nondichotomous wisdom.\n2.4 Cosmic Buddhas and Buddha-fields\n\nEven in the early Buddhist tradition, Sakyamuni\u2019s attainment of\nawakening was not regarded as an utterly unique event or even the\nfirst occurrence of buddhahood. Nevertheless, the appearance of a\nbuddha, who bears the epochal role of bringing liberation to beings\nthrough teaching, was regarded as a momentous event in the history of\nthe world. The early tradition had taught instead the ideal of the\narhat, who would enter into nirvana upon death, having completely\neradicated blind passions and attained emancipation from further\nrebirth within the world of samsaric existence.\n\nThe Mahayana tradition, however, recognized the attainment of\nbuddhahood itself\u2014not merely deliverance from afflicting\npassions and samsaric existence\u2014as the genuine goal of religious\npractice and proclaimed it, along with the engagement with beings in\nsamsara that it implied, as the supreme fulfillment for all sentient\nbeings since the beginningless past. It is natural, therefore, that\nMahayana Buddhists recognize the present existence of vast numbers of\ncelestial buddhas and bodhisattvas who had already reached\nattainment.\n\nFurther, it was assumed in Indian Buddhism that two buddhas could not\nappear in a single epoch of a world system, any more than two\n\u201cuniversal monarchs\u201d (cakravartin) could rule\nsimultaneously. Thus, the existence of innumerable buddhas implied\nthat there are myriads of purified buddha-fields over which they\npreside, for it may be expected that, through aeons of history in\nnumberless worlds, countless beings will have attained supreme\nawakening by following the bodhisattva path, and these beings all work\nfor the liberation of others in their own spheres of realization.\nMahayana writings often refer to the concept of the \u201cgreat\nchiliocosm,\u201d which is made up of one billion universes. In the\nMahayana cosmology, there are great chiliocosms countless as the sands\nof the Ganges throughout the ten quarters, and most are buddha-fields,\nor parts of buddha-fields, in which a buddha teaches dharma for the\nbenefit of its inhabitants. Our own universe\u2014called the\nSah\u0101 world, or \u201cworld in which pain must be\nendured\u201d\u2014is the buddha-field of Sakyamuni, the sphere in\nwhich he appeared in order to save the beings within it. Thus, the\nentire cosmos is a panoply of countless buddha-fields in which the\ndrama of the salvation of all beings is carried out, with buddhas and\nbodhisattvas radiating the light of wisdom-compassion for all living\nthings.\n2.5 Monastic and Lay\n\nA third aspect of notable relevance to the Pure Land tradition is the\ntranscendence of the dichotomy of monastic and lay in Mahayana\nthought. Monastic life had developed as the practical norm for\nBuddhist life in the early tradition, for the end was personal\nemancipation from samsaric existence. Practice was construed as\nobservance of the monastic code and meditative practices, and\nwithdrawal from ordinary lay life was itself seen as a crucial step in\nbreaking the bonds of samsaric existence. Mahayanists, however, sought\nto realize a fully nondichotomous wisdom; hence, while in actual\npractice they continued to recognize the efficacy of monastic life as\na means to the goal, renunciation of lay life was not in itself an\nintrinsic or requisite aspect of emancipation. They therefore\nreformulated the central elements of the path\u2014traditionally\ngiven as the \u201cthree learnings\u201d of precepts, meditation,\nand wisdom\u2014as the six paramitas\u2014giving, moral action,\npatience, effort, meditation, and wisdom. In this enumeration of\nvirtues, we find selfless giving understood not simply as alms-giving\nor \u201ccharity,\u201d but as the total, compassionate activity of\nbodhisattvas for whom meritorious action leading to enlightenment and\nthe giving of their own merit to others are interfused. Other\nparamitas also emphasize the resolution to fulfill the bodhisattva\nvows for the enlightenment of all beings. Moreover, precepts or\nmorality was not necessarily construed as the rigid monastic rule\ngoverning sequestered life apart from normal society, but as a more\ngeneral code of proper action observable in varying degrees in lay\nlife also. Thus, true practice and attainment transcends the dualism\nof monk and lay, and the arena of the bodhisattva\u2019s practice is\nprecisely the realm of samsara in which unenlightened beings wander.\nThis insight rooted in Mahayana thought from its beginnings underlies\nthe evolution of Pure Land Buddhism in Japan in particular, which\nduring the period of its most dynamic development evinces precisely\nthe shift of the center of praxis from assumptions of monastic\nefficacy to an emphasis on everyday life as the domain of in which\ngenuine practice is manifested.\n3. Japanese Pure Land Buddhist Thought\n3.1 H\u014dnen\u2019s Revolutionary Understanding of Nembutsu as Praxis\n\nSince our fundamental concern is with characteristically Japanese\ndevelopments of Pure Land thought, I will focus in particular on the\nstream of H\u014dnen. It was H\u014dnen who achieved perhaps the\nradical doctrinal innovation of his seminal period in Japanese\nBuddhist history by establishing the practice of vocal nembutsu as an\nindependent, self-sufficient path of Buddhist praxis. Despite\nwidespread esteem for his priestly and scholarly attainments and the\npurity of his religious aspirations, H\u014dnen himself, in his\npenetrating self-reflection, expressed a profound awareness of his\nincapacity to fulfill any Buddhist practice and thereby advance\nhimself toward enlightenment. He therefore searched throughout\nBuddhist tradition for an accessible path, and at length found the\nexposition of the nembutsu.\n\nNembutsu practices in early Buddhist tradition centered on mindfulness\nexercises conducted in veneration of Sakyamuni Buddha, and included\nelements of bodily worship and the reverent repetition of the name of\nthe Buddha. Later, it developed into a core practice of monastics\ninvolving ritual prostrations with the body, contemplation on the\nfeatures of enlightened beings and vocal recitation of their names,\nconducted with long lists of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Such nembutsu\npractice was and remains a basic practice in the Tendai monastery of\nEnryaku-ji on Mount Hiei, where H\u014dnen originally trained and\nlived. In addition, the Chinese Tientai practice of \u201cconstant\nwalking samadhi\u201d (j\u014dgy\u014d zammai), in which a\nmonk circumambulates a large statue of Amida, intoning the nembutsu\nand meditating on Amida Buddha and features of the Pure Land\ncontinuously for ninety days, had been transmitted to Mount Hiei\nduring the Heian period, and the group practice of \u201cconstant\nnembutsu\u201d (fudan nembutsu) in which the nembutsu was\nchanted continuously for a set number of days\u2014three or\nseven\u2014interspersed with the chanting of sutra passages and hymns\nat the \u201csix hours\u201d of the day, was frequently conducted.\nAlthough deeply familiar with such comprehensive modes of practice\nembracing physical, mental, and verbal discipline, and although widely\nrevered for his own contemplative and scholarly attainments,\nH\u014dnen taught that simply uttering the Name of Amida Buddha,\n\u201cNamu-amida-butsu,\u201d entrusting oneself to his vow to save\nall beings, results in birth into Amida\u2019s buddha-field of\nenlightened activity. No intellectual command of Buddhist teachings,\naccumulation of merit, moral rectitude, or any act of practice other\nthan the vocal nembutsu is necessary.\n\nThe Pure Land Buddhist path based on the working of Amida\u2019s Vow\nis therefore an effective means toward emancipation from\nbirth-and-death and attainment of Buddhahood\u2014for H\u014dnen, the\nonly viable way for people at present\u2014and it can be practiced\nindependently of any other Buddhist teaching or method of praxis.\nWhile traditionally the nembutsu practice involved mental\nconcentration and the accumulation of numerous recitations, H\u014dnen\ntaught that in the Pure Land path only the simple saying of\n\u201cNamu-amida-butsu\u201d with complete trust was involved. There\nwas no specified manner of utterance, no necessity for any\naccompanying ritual or meditative endeavor, and no stipulation of the\nlength of the period of practice or number of repetitions.\n\nThe question, of course, is why mere vocalization of Amida\u2019s\nName should hold the power to bring about birth into a buddha-field\nand eventual enlightenment, which in our present condition are\nvirtually impossible to accomplish, even through the achievement of\nextensive learning, deep meditative states, heroic discipline, and\ncompassionate action. Without an adequate demonstration that vocal\nnembutsu held such power, Pure Land praxis would remain an\nsupplementary discipline within the existing schools of Buddhist\ntradition, one supportive practice to be performed in combination with\na range of other methods.\n\nH\u014dnen promulgated his teaching by adopting an innovative\nperspective on the nature of the practices taught in Buddhist\ntradition. He reasoned that, although the utterance of the\nBuddha\u2019s name had long been transmitted in various Buddhist\nschools as one among countless different kinds of practice useful for\nattainment of enlightenment, the vocal nembutsu designated in\nAmida\u2019s vow as the act leading to birth into the Pure Land was\nqualitatively distinct from every one of the thousands of other\ntechniques found in the Buddhist teachings. While the physical act of\nvoicing the Name of Amida in itself might be identical, in other forms\nof Buddhism it was performed in conjunction with various other\npractices, including the awakening of the resolute aspiration for\nenlightenment (bodhicitta; see 2.2 above) and the selfless\ntransference of merits, and like other practices, its fulfillment as\npraxis genuinely leading toward Buddhahood turned on the\npractitioner\u2019s own purity of motive and powers of concentration\nand discipline.\n\nThe nembutsu taught in Amida\u2019s vow, however, as the simple\nvoicing of \u201cNamu-amida-butsu\u201d accessible to all beings\nregardless of their moral qualities or spiritual capacities, was\nspecifically selected by Amida Buddha as the means by which he could\nbring to fruition his compassionate vow to liberate all living things\nfrom samsaric existence. In other words, Amida, through his vow and\nthe salvific virtue of his own already completed performance of\nendless aeons of bodhisattva practices, established the saying of the\nName as the medium by which his own compassionate working actively\nreaches each being. Thus, the nembutsu has been prepared for beings as\neffective practice\u2014already fulfilled by Amida as the\nact resulting in birth in the Pure Land. This salvific activity is\nparticularly appropriate in the present age, when the accomplishment\nof praxis as ordinarily understood in Buddhist tradition has receded\nbeyond the reach of beings. Anticipating this situation, Amida\u2019s\nvow teaches that one should relinquish the illusions and attachments\nfocused on the self and its capacities and set aside the extensive\nbody of traditional methods of praxis as no longer effective, since\nthey require a purity of performance no longer achievable. The Pure\nLand tradition characterizes such practices as\n\u201cself-power\u201d and advocates instead a turn to the saying\nthe nembutsu as the act that embodies \u201cOther Power,\u201d Amida\nBuddha\u2019s wisdom-compassion functioning in the world.\n\nTwo aspects of H\u014dnen historical role relate directly to our\nconcerns here with philosophical aspects of interpreting and\narticulating his religious awareness: the means by which H\u014dnen\neffected his ground-breaking contribution to Buddhist tradition, and\nH\u014dnen\u2019s legacy as inherited by his disciples. Regarding the\nfirst, H\u014dnen is recognized as the first and perhaps most\nrevolutionary \u201cfounder\u201d of a native Japanese Buddhist\ntradition. Based on his principle of \u201cthe nembutsu selected in\nAmida\u2019s primal vow\u201d (senjaku hongan nembutsu) as\nthe practice embodying the Buddha\u2019s Other Power, he established\nthe Pure Land school (J\u014ddosh\u016b) as an authentic Buddhist\npath, effective in itself and independent from the traditionally\nrecognized schools that had been transmitted to Japan from the Asian\ncontinent over the preceding centuries. H\u014dnen set about to\naccomplish this in his major writing, Collection on the Nembutsu\nSelected in the Primal Vow (Senchaku hongan\nnembutsu-sh\u016b), composed in kanbun (Chinese) and\naddressed to an audience versed in Buddhist erudition and its methods\nof discourse. Here, H\u014dnen systematically raises the traditional\nissues involved in recognizing the Pure Land teaching as a legitimate\nschool of Buddhism, such as the identification of foundational sutras,\nthe delineation of the historical lineage of masters by which the Pure\nLand path has been transmitted down to the present, and its doctrinal\northodoxy, demonstrated with reference to the sutras and the\ncommentarial tradition. In his work, H\u014dnen argues logically and\ncogently on the basis of scriptural evidence, including extended\ncitations from the recognized Chinese canon.\n\nH\u014dnen allowed his work to be copied only by disciples during his\nlifetime, but it was published shortly after his death. It immediately\ngarnered vehement censure and counter-argument from scholar-monks of\ntraditional schools, attesting to the impact H\u014dnen\u2019s\nnembutsu teaching was already having in Japanese society, but also to\nthe recognition of the forms of scholastic discourse and rational\nargument into which his thought had been cast. From the accounts of\nhis followers and records of his spoken words and letters, it appears\nthat H\u014dnen was an immensely charismatic figure, communicating his\nteaching to both the ordained and lay and persuasively responding to\nthe questions of his many listeners from all walks of life.\nNevertheless, the major formulation of his religious thought followed\ncustomary models, dictated by his formidable role in Buddhist\nhistory.\n3.2 The Problematic of H\u014dnen\u2019s Nembutsu Teaching\n\nAs we have seen, H\u014dnen asserted that the nembutsu as imparted to\nbeings in Amida\u2019s vow differs profoundly from all other\npractices handed down in Buddhist tradition. Persons might, therefore,\nperform the utterance of the Buddha\u2019s name as another means of\nhealing the mind and gaining merit, in continuous recitation or as an\nelement of ritual worship or contemplative practice, or they might say\nthe name as the act prescribed in Amida\u2019s vow, entrusting\nthemselves wholly to the working of the Buddha\u2019s compassion and\nabandoning any notion of their own goodness or effort as contributing\nto realization. The former manifests self-power, the latter Other\nPower. H\u014dnen taught that it is only the latter that remains\noperative now for us. However, a serious difficulty in understanding\nthis teaching arose among H\u014dnen\u2019s following, one H\u014dnen\nstruggled to deal with but was unable to resolve doctrinally.\n\nDisciples found that the nembutsu of Amida\u2019s vow as proclaimed\nby H\u014dnen in fact involves two elements, both of which are\nessential: on the one hand, the actual saying of Amida\u2019s Name,\n\u201cNamu-amida-butsu,\u201d and on the other, the wholehearted\nentrusting of oneself to Amida\u2019s vow, which, as we have seen, is\nprecisely what qualitatively distinguishes vocal nembutsu from all\nother methods of practice and makes one\u2019s performance of it the\npractice selected for beings and already fulfilled by Amida. For\nH\u014dnen, these two elements of practice and faith\u2014utterance\nof the nembutsu and the entrusting of oneself to Amida\u2019s\nvow\u2014were mutually and unproblematically interfused, but many who\nsought to follow his teaching found that in actual engagement, the\npath appeared to be defined by emphasis on one element or the other.\nThe question became for many followers: which is central in the life\nlived in genuine accord with Amida\u2019s vow, practice or faith? In\nother words, concretely, how should persons of the nembutsu carry on\ntheir lives?\n\nThose who emphasized practice tended to assume that since the nembutsu\nwas devised and provided out of Amida\u2019s wisdom-compassion, those\nwho entrust themselves to the Buddha\u2019s vow will spontaneously,\nout of joy and gratitude, seek to live in mindfulness of Amida and to\nrecite the name as often as possible throughout the remainder of their\nlives. This view, however, sometimes shaded into ethical and\neschatological concerns. Some assumed that practitioners of the\nnembutsu should seek to live lives appropriate for birth into\nAmida\u2019s buddha-field, lives of diligent recitation and moral\nrectitude; those who failed to display such dedication were viewed as\nnegligent in their practice. Further, many adopted older views rooted\nin the Contemplation Sutra, in which nembutsu recitation was\nseen pragmatically, as a means of canceling the karmic effects of\none\u2019s past evil. This latter belief gave decisive weight to the\nnembutsu uttered at the moment of death, when the nullification of\none\u2019s final defilements of karmic evil made birth in the Pure\nLand possible.\n\nBy contrast, those who emphasized trust tended toward a more relaxed\nview of nembutsu recitation and other forms of religious observance or\nmoral rigor, insisting instead on a total trust in Amida\u2019s\ncompassion. The Pure Land sutras speak of ten or even a single\nutterance as adequate, and H\u014dnen affirms this teaching, since the\nname as prepared for beings by Amida holds the resultant virtues of\nhis inconceivably long and perfect practice. When one takes refuge in\nthe vow and utters the nembutsu, one\u2019s salvation is promised by\nAmida and one should have no misgivings. At an extreme, however,\ninsistence on leaving all to Amida\u2019s salvific activity led to\nforms of antinomianism, in which even moral restraint was viewed as\nthe impulse to deny the fact of one\u2019s cravings and affirm\none\u2019s own goodness. In more benign forms, emphasis on trust led\nto a denigration of continued utterance as evidence of doubt of the\nvow\u2019s power and as a residue of attachment to one\u2019s own\naction in bringing about attainment.\n\nH\u014dnen sought to maintain a tenuous balance between these two,\nmutually disparaging positions of emphasis on praxis and emphasis on\nfaith:\n\n\nIf, because it is taught [in the Larger Sutra] that birth is\nattained with but one or ten utterances, you say the nembutsu\nheedlessly, then faith is hindering practice. If, because it is taught\n[in Shandao\u2019s commentaries] that you should say the Name\n\u201cwithout abandoning it from moment to moment,\u201d you believe\none or ten utterances to be indecisive, then practice is hindering\nfaith. As your faith, accept that birth is attained with a single\nutterance; as your practice, endeavor in the nembutsu throughout life.\n(recorded in \u201cZensh\u014d-b\u014d ni shimesu on-kotoba,\u201d\nin Ky\u014dd\u014d 1987, p. 464 and in Hirota 1989, pp.\n12\u201313)\n\n\nHistorically, however, we find that while H\u014dnen was able to\ntransmit his insights through his own compelling presence, after his\ndeath, his disciples developed their individual interpretations of his\nnembutsu teaching in diverse directions, with some tending toward\nemphasis on nembutsu practice and other toward trust in the vow. The\nmaster, in short, failed to achieve a clear doctrinal resolution of\nthis issue of religious life. In other words, he was unable to give a\npersuasive account of the nexus between sentient being and Other\nPower, and appears finally to affirm anew the efficacy of human\naction, as either recitation of the name of Amida or entrusting of\noneself to Amida\u2019s vow, or as a combination of both.\n4. Philosophical Issues in Japanese Pure Land Buddhist Thought\n\nThe question of the relationship between a person\u2019s act of\nnembutsu and Amida Buddha\u2019s Other Power\u2014or between trust\nin Amida\u2019s vow, which infuses each human act of nembutsu with\nOther Power, and the practice of the nembutsu, which has been devised\nand made efficacious for beings by the Buddha\u2014raises profound\nquestions concerning the sources and significance of human\nsubjectivity and agency. Above all, the emergence of such issues\nwithin the context of a thoroughgoing application of the general\nMahayana critique of self-attachment in religious praxis gave rise to\nthe most innovative philosophical reflection in the Japanese Pure Land\ntradition. Thus, it is among disciples of H\u014dnen who tended toward\nthe pole of emphasis on trust or on the adequacy of a single utterance\nan engagement with issues that have a distinct resonance with\nintellectual concerns today. This is because such disciples found it\nnecessary to take up questions of one\u2019s self-awareness in the\nrelationship between being and Buddha in the immediate present and to\ndelineate a groundwork for deconstructing commonsense subject-object\ndualisms applied to this relationship without recourse to abstract\nconceptions of mystical transcendence.\n\nAt the same time, all of H\u014dnen\u2019s disciples found it\nnecessary to formulate responses to the relentless criticisms of the\ntraditional schools, which led periodically to state suppression of\nthe nembutsu teaching, and some resorted to adjustment of various\npositions H\u014dnen\u2019s logic led him to. For example, one of the\nleading disciples, Sh\u014dk\u014d (1162\u20131238), founder of the\ndominant Chinzei branch of the J\u014ddo school, abandoned\nH\u014dnen\u2019s view that only the nembutsu could lead to birth in\nthe Pure Land and recognized the efficacy of the traditional\npractices. Others, however, such as Shinran, Sh\u014dk\u016b\n(1177\u20131247), and Ippen (1239\u20131289), pursued the\ndevelopment of H\u014dnen\u2019s radical teaching, each in his own\ndistinctive way, and it is among such figures that we find the more\nphilosophical strains of thinking.\n\nLet us turn here to several basic issues in Pure Land Buddhist thought\nthat (1) emerged from problems of practical engagement but were given\ncharacteristic treatment specifically in Japan, and (2) may be\nconsidered to have received philosophical attention in the sense that,\nregarding them, Japanese Pure Land Buddhists were forced, by\nintra-sectarian debate, to seek a degree of intellectual\nself-understanding distinct both from scholastic Buddhist discourse\nand from the kind of realization achieved through religious\nengagement.\n\nIn addition, for convenience, I will discuss these issues under the\nheadings of metaphysics, anthropology, hermeneutics, and ethics. It\nshould be borne in mind, however, that these Western categories, while\nhelpful in establishing a starting point and pursuing the comparative\nconcerns implied in a \u201cphilosophical\u201d approach to Buddhist\nthought, suggest conceptual contours that must in fact be continually\nbreached in seeking to accommodate the fundamentally pragmatic\norientation of the Japanese Pure Land tradition and its roots in\nMahayana Buddhist thought. In fact, the four headings are best\nunderstood as slightly differing perspectives on essentially the same\ncentral problem: the apprehension of what is true and real from within\na stance of radical conditionedness. What enables such apprehension?\nWhat is its significance for human existence? How does it come about?\nAnd what implications does it hold for the conduct of life?\n4.1 Pure Land Buddhist Metaphysics: Reflection on Reality\n\nThe principal metaphysical question occasioned by Japanese Pure Land\nBuddhism arises most naturally concerning the meaning of a\nbeing\u2019s birth in the Pure Land and the ontological status of\nAmida Buddha. Although Western researchers have often been confident\nin imposing substantialist assumptions on Pure Land thought,\nasserting, for example, that H\u014dnen and his followers thought of\nthe Pure Land as a geographical place, and although many Pure Land\nBuddhists assume that past thinkers regarded the Dharmakara-Amida\nnarrative as historical in a modern sense, in fact the dominant\ntraditional motif in treating questions of the reality of Amida and\nthe Pure Land reflects, not such notions as substance, identity,\nautonomy, and permanence, but an interactive, dynamic movement across\nprovisional dichotomies of formless reality and form, enlightened\nwisdom and ignorance, transtemporality and time, buddha and sentient\nbeing. This thinking characterized by the discriminative perception of\nthe world of beings rooted in the nondiscriminative apprehension of\nreality may be seen in relation to the question of the real existence\nof beings born in the Pure Land in the following passage from the\nsixth century Chinese Pure Land thinker Tanluan (476\u2013542):\n\nQuestion: In the Mahayana sutras and treatises it is frequently\ntaught that sentient beings are in the final analysis unborn, like\nempty space. Why does Bodhisattva Vasubandhu express aspiration for\n\u201cbirth\u201d?\nAnswer: The statement, \u201cSentient beings are unborn, like\nempty space,\u201d is open to two interpretations. First, what\nordinary people see\u2014such as sentient beings, which they conceive\nas real, or the acts of being born and dying, which they view as\nreal\u2014is ultimately non-existent, like imaginary \u201ctortoise\nfur,\u201d or like empty space. Second, since all things are\n\u201cborn\u201d from causal conditions, they are actually unborn;\nthat is, they are non-existent, like empty space.\n\n\nThe \u201cbirth\u201d to which Bodhisattva Vasubandhu aspires refers\nto being born through causal conditions. Hence it is provisionally\ntermed \u201cbirth.\u201d This does not mean that there are real\nbeings or that being born and dying is real, as ordinary people\nimagine.\n\nQuestion: In what sense do you speak of birth in the Pure\nLand?\nAnswer: For the provisionally-called \u201cperson\u201d in this\nworld who practices the five gates of mindfulness, the preceding\nthought is the cause of the succeeding thought. The\nprovisionally-called \u201cperson\u201d of this defiled world and\nthe provisionally-called \u201cperson\u201d of the Pure Land cannot\nbe definitely called the same or definitely called different. The same\nis true of preceding thought and succeeding thought. The reason is\nthat if they were one and the same, then there would be no causality;\nif they were different, there would be no continuity. This principle\nis the gate of contemplating sameness and difference; it is discussed\nin detail in the treatises. (Shinran CWS, 1: 27\u201328)\n\n\nWe see that from very early in the East Asian tradition, as well known\nin Japan, Pure Land thinkers applied the Mahayana logic of the\nnonduality and interpenetration of discriminative and\nnondiscriminative realms to Pure Land concepts.\n\nRegarding the nature of Amida Buddha, perhaps the most natural\napproach for the modern mind is to focus on the relationship between\nAmida and Sakyamuni. While Amida, Buddha of infinite light and eternal\nlife, may be regarded as the \u201ccelestial\u201d personification\nof perfect wisdom-compassion, and the narrative of his attainment in\nthe inconceivable past as \u201cmythic,\u201d Gotama, known by his\nhonorific title Sakyamuni Buddha, is recognized as a historical\nfigure, a mendicant wanderer and religious teacher of India in the\nfifth century BCE. It is common to say, therefore, that Sakyamuni\nbelongs to the realm of historical fact and actual existence, while\nAmida is fictive. This view is supported by the modern understanding\nof the relationship between the two buddhas. Sakyamuni, having become\nthe \u201cawakened one\u201d through meditative practices, taught\nhis realization to others, and among the teachings attributed to him\nis the story of Amida Buddha. Although historical evidence now\nsuggests that the teaching of Amida gradually emerged around the\nbeginning of the common era\u2014five centuries after\nSakyamuni\u2019s death\u2014even if it appeared later in the\ntradition stemming from Sakyamuni, the fundamental question of the\nrelationship between Amida and the person(s) who first taught him\nremains unchanged. Amida Buddha has never appeared directly as a\nhistorical personage, and there are no teachings or words that can be\nattributed to him. Thus, it is common to view the story of Amida as a\nnarrative fashioned by Sakyamuni (or a later figure) to express the\ncontent of his own religious insight. Since his awakening could not be\nconveyed directly, he resorted to the use of parables and myths, and\nthe story of Amida is considered such a \u201cskillful means\u201d\n(h\u014dben) or mythic device for teaching. In this view,\nAmida is a fiction whose origins lie in the experience of Sakyamuni.\nFurther, it is often assumed that while unlettered Pure Land adherents\nmay have clung to the notion of Amida and his vows as real, taking\nthem as objects of faith, more sophisticated Buddhists such as those\nof the Tendai, Shingon, and Zen schools recognized all along that\nAmida is merely a skillful \u201cmetaphor\u201d or\n\u201csymbol\u201d for the historical realization of Sakyamuni.\n\nIn fact, there is basic continuity in the perspective on Amida among\nthe Mahayana schools, and it stands diametrically opposed to modernist\nassumptions. For Mahayana Buddhists, reality resides not fundamentally\nwith the historical existence of Sakyamuni as such, but rather with\nthat for which he is recognized as buddha, or that which is the\nmotive-force for his appearance in the world, his attainment of\nbuddhahood, and his teaching of dharma. Reality assumes form in order\nto emerge into the consciousness of sentient beings and thereby guide\nbeings beyond the attachments and compulsions of their discriminative,\nreifying, conceptual grasp of their own existence and the things of\nthe world around them.\n\nThis circular dynamic moving between formless reality and the world of\nforms may be seen with regard to the relationship between Sakaymuni\nand Amida in H\u014dnen\u2019s exposition. He states:\n\n\nConcerning the central purport [of the Larger Sutra]:\nSakyamuni discarded the supreme Pure Land and appeared in this defiled\nworld; this was to expound the teaching of the Pure land and, by\nencouraging sentient beings, to bring them to birth in the Pure Land.\nAmida Tathagata discarded this defiled world and emerged in the Pure\nLand; this was to guide sentient beings of this defiled world and\nbring them to birth in the Pure Land. This is none other than the\nfundamental intent with which all buddhas go out to the Pure Land and\nemerge in the defiled world. (Mury\u014djuky\u014d shaku in\nKy\u014dd\u014d 1987, p. 67)\n\n\nIn H\u014dnen\u2019s view, Sakyamuni and Amida function as paired\naspects of a movement of compassionate activity in teaching and\nguiding, out of true reality into the defiled world, and out from the\ndefiled world into \u201cthe supreme Pure Land\u201d that is the\nabode of all buddhas. We see here that H\u014dnen transforms the\nframework of historical sequence by beginning with Sakyamuni, even\nthough Amida\u2019s attainment of buddhahood occurred aeons prior to\nSakyamuni\u2019s appearance. Without Sakyamuni, Amida would remain\nunknown to beings in this world and his work of leading all to his\nbuddha-field would go unapprehended; without Amida, Sakyamuni would\nhave no effective means of liberating beings and his teaching mission\nwould be futile. In place of a linear chronology, we have a motif of\nmovement between the timeless and mundane time, by which the\ntemporality of karmic causation and discriminative thinking is\nbroken.\n\nShinran develops the reciprocity between Amida and Sakyamuni seen in\nH\u014dnen into an asymmetric relationship, and by thus giving\npriority to Amida, moves even further from a modern orientation that\nwould emphasize the historical reality of Sakyamuni. For Shinran, it\nis the motive-force of wisdom-compassion that underlies the historical\nexistence of Sakyamuni\u2014that in fact made him buddha\u2014and\nthis wisdom-compassion is itself the life of Amida Buddha. Hence,\nSakyamuni\u2019s historical existence may be understood as a\nmanifestation of Amida, perhaps one among countless others.\n\nThis understanding may be seen in Shinran\u2019s demonstration that\nthe Larger Sutra, among all the sutras, expresses the true\nteaching for which Sakyamuni appeared in the world. Shinran focuses on\nthe pattern in the sutras by which, prior to expounding dharma, the\nBuddha enters a profound samadhi and delves to the nondiscriminative\nwisdom that transcends words and concepts. On emerging from the\nsamadhi, he reemerges into the realm of words and responds to\nquestions from his disciples. While his words are those of ordinary\nhuman discourse, they give expression to the samadhi he attained.\nThus, the source of Sakyamuni\u2019s teaching is the samadhi he\nentered, the transcendent reality or wisdom itself.\n\nAt the beginning of the Larger Sutra, Sakyamuni\u2019s\ndisciple \u0100nanda observes, from the splendor and serenity apparent\nin the Buddha\u2019s countenance, that the Buddha has entered the\nsamadhi of great tranquility (Jp. daijakuj\u014d, in the Tang\ntranslation titled Sutra of the Tathagata of Immeasurable\nLife) and requests him to explain its significance. Sakyamuni\nproceeds to deliver the teaching of Amida Buddha. In other words,\nSakyamuni has attained the reality that is the essential quality of\nall Buddhas\u2014in a commentary on the Larger Sutra it is\ncalled the \u201cplace where all Buddhas abide\u201d\u2014and on\nthis basis he reveals the story of Amida, for Amida is the primordial\nBuddha who embodies the essence of all Buddhas. From the perspective\nof this sutra, were it not for Amida, whose Buddhahood lies at the\nheart of the samadhi of great tranquility, Sakyamuni himself would not\nbe Buddha. At the same time, were it not for Sakyamuni, the teaching\nof Amida would not be disclosed to the world.\n\nThus, the relationship between Amida and Sakyamuni is not that between\ntwo distinct figures, or between the religious symbol taught and the\nteacher. Rather, it is viewed in a broader framework of Amida\u2019s\ncharacteristic as standing both in formless reality and the world of\nforms, in the eternal and in history. Sakyamuni is not separate from\nAmida, and in teaching dharma he manifests the activity or movement\ntowards beings that is Amida\u2019s essential quality.\n\nIt may be said that while meditative traditions in Buddhism tend to\nemphasize the elimination of delusional thinking and the apprehension\nof formless reality free of the imposition of egocentric\ndiscrimination, the Pure Land tradition is attentive to the\ncompassionate working of reality to awaken beings incapable of\neradicating conceptual thought. It does so by manifesting itself in\nforms and approaching beings. Late in life, Shinran adopted the term\njinen, \u201cnaturalness\u201d or \u201cbeing made to\nbecome so of itself,\u201d for the spontaneous working of reality in\nthe liberative process by which beings of afflicting passions reach\nenlightenment. In this process, the Mahayana assertion that\n\u201csamsara is none other than nirvana\u201d or \u201cafflicting\npassions are none other than awakening\u201d is affirmed, so that the\nend of the Pure Land path lies in this world, in the compassionate\nworking for the liberation of all beings.\n\nIn relation to beings of the world, Pure Land thinkers such as\nSh\u014dk\u016b and Shinran asserted that the real, as itself\nnondiscriminative and nondualistic wisdom or suchness, pervades all\nthings. Since beings cannot attain such wisdom, reality as such cannot\nbe grasped. Nevertheless, through that which is real that permeates\ntheir existence, all beings, including \u201cgrasses, trees, and the\nland itself,\u201d hold the potential for awakening. Such terms as\n\u201cemptiness\u201d and \u201cdependent origination\u201d are\nsometimes understood in metaphysical terms, but in the context of\nMahayana Buddhist tradition, they are not concepts by which to grasp\nreality, but above all elements of practice, expressing the\nrealization of the person who enters into profound samadhi by cutting\noff discriminative thought and eradicating afflicting passions.\nBecause the Pure Land path is not based on such praxis, the use of\nsuch terms is unnecessary.\n4.2 Pure Land Buddhist Anthropology\n\nFor H\u014dnen and his followers, the characterization of \u201cdeep\nmind\u201d (one of \u201cthree minds\u201d or attitudes prescribed\nin the Contemplation Sutra) by the Chinese master Shandao\n(613\u2013681) provides a classic expression of the understanding of\nhuman existence in the Pure Land path:\n\n\n\u201cDeep mind\u201d is the deeply entrusting mind. There are two\naspects. One is to believe deeply and decidedly that you are a foolish\nbeing of karmic evil caught in birth-and-death, ever sinking and ever\nwandering in transmigration from innumerable kalpas in the past, with\nnever a condition that would lead to emancipation. The second is to\nbelieve deeply and decidedly that Amida Buddha\u2019s Forty-eight\nVows grasp sentient beings, and that allowing yourself to be carried\nby the power of the Vow without any doubt or apprehension, you will\nattain birth. (Commentary on the Contemplation Sutra, quoted\nin Shinran CWS I: 85.)\n\nSecond [of the three minds] is deep mind, which is true and real\nshinjin. One truly knows oneself to be a foolish being full of blind\npassions, with scant roots of good, transmigrating in the three realms\nand unable to emerge from this burning house. And further, one truly\nknows now, without so much as a single thought of doubt, that\nAmida\u2019s universal Primal Vow decisively enables all to attain\nbirth, including those who say the Name even down to ten times, or\neven but hear it. (Hymns of Birth in the Pure Land, quoted in\nShinran CWS I: 92)\n\n\nThree points may be noted here. First, the self-awareness of the\npractitioner indicated by Shan-tao is that of a human being wholly\nincapable of fulfilling Buddhist practices. This is expressed in\neschatological terms of endless entrapment in samsaric existence: one\nis burdened by the karmic consequences of evil acts of past lives\nextending from the immeasurable past; one continues to act from the\ndesires and hatreds arising from ignorant self-attachment in the\npresent; bereft as one is of any genuine goodness, one\u2019s future\ncan only be further painful existence in endless transmigration.\n\nThe second point is that this self-awareness coexists with the\nrealization that all beings are enabled to attain birth in the Pure\nLand through Amida\u2019s Vow. In other words, the self-reflection\nimplied in deep mind is, in its opposite aspect, at the same time deep\ntrust in the salvific power of Amida. The third point is that while\nhuman being and Buddha stand thus as thoroughgoing opposites\u2014the\nbeing filled with afflicting passions and lacking any goodness that\nmight lead toward enlightenment, on the one hand, and the Buddha\nfreely exerting the power of wisdom-compassion, on the\nother\u2014deep mind arises as a unitary awareness out of the\ninteraction of being and Buddha. Self-reflection and trust arise\nsimultaneously. Without the approach of Amida, not only trust, but\nalso genuine self-awareness is unattainable.\n\nH\u014dnen, who was renowned in his period as a Tendai monk of\nextensive learning and exemplary practice, gives direct expression to\nthe two aspects of \u201cdeep mind\u201d:\n\n\nAlthough Buddhism is vast, in essence it is composed of no more than\nthe three learnings [of precepts, meditation, and wisdom.] \u2026\nBut as for precepts, I myself do not keep a single one. In meditation,\nI have not attained even one. In wisdom, I have not attained the right\nwisdom of cutting off discriminative thinking and realizing the\nfruit\u2026 . [Nevertheless,] without distinguishing between wise\nand foolish, the upholding of precepts and the breaking of them, Amida\nBuddha comes to welcome us. (Recorded in Tetsu senchaku hongan\nnembutsu sh\u016b, J\u014ddosh\u016b zensho 7:\n95\u201396)\n\n\nIt is in such self-awareness that we see the force behind\nH\u014dnen\u2019s radical reorientation of the understanding of\npraxis. H\u014dnen saw clearly that unless a wholly new perspective\nwere established regarding the categorization and evaluation of the\nmyriad practices taught in Buddhist tradition, the genuine meaning of\nthe Pure Land path as he had come to understand it would remain\nobscure, and vocal nembutsu would continue to be viewed by all people\nas merely an expedient practice for inferior practitioners. He\ntherefore raised the issue of the subjectivity of the practitioner,\nand insisted that commonsense hierarchies rooted in presuppositions of\none\u2019s own fundamental perspicuity and autonomous capacity to\njudge had to be abandoned. To accomplish this shift, H\u014dnen relied\non the thoroughgoing application of his innovative concept of\n\u201cselection from among alternatives\u201d (senchaku),\nwhich refers most centrally to Amida\u2019s own selection, for\nbeings, of vocal nembutsu as the single, universally accessible\npractice that results in birth into the Pure Land. Beings\u2019\ntaking up of the Pure Land path is thus founded upon Amida\u2019s\nselection and fulfillment of the nembutsu for all beings equally. We\nsee, therefore, that the dual awareness of \u201cdeep mind\u201d is\nat the core of H\u014dnen\u2019s path.\n\nH\u014dnen\u2019s methodical logic led to positions easily vilified\nby scholar-monks of the traditional schools. One example is his\nenumeration of \u201cthe awakening of aspiration for\nenlightenment\u201d (hotsu bodaishin) among the traditional\n\u201cpractices\u201d to be set aside by nembutsu practitioners. As\nexplained in section 2.2 above, this\n\u201cbodhi-mind\u201d\u2014the profound aspiration for\nenlightenment for oneself and all beings\u2014had traditionally\nbeen considered the crucial starting point for the Mahayana\nbodhisattva, and other Japanese Pure Land masters such as Genshin had\naffirmed it to be the core of genuine desire for the Pure Land.\nAlthough H\u014dnen\u2019s position is somewhat ambiguous, in\nSenchakush\u016b his steadfast logic leads understandably to\na rejection of the notion that any attitude or attainment beyond trust\nand utterance is necessary for the person of nembutsu.\n\nH\u014dnen\u2019s religious anthropology is perhaps the hallmark of\nhis tradition, but his closest disciples sought to balance his\nrejection of self-power with the delineation of the working of Other\nPower in the practitioner. One of the harshest criticisms of\nH\u014dnen from the traditional schools came from My\u014de\n(1173\u20131232), of the Kegon school. My\u014de argued that\nawakening the bodhi-mind was not to be viewed as a specific practice\nwithin the path, but as the core of all authentic Mahayana praxis,\nwhich must be infused with the nondiscriminative wisdom that is also\ncompassion. Thus, H\u014dnen\u2019s rejection of bodhi-mind was a\ndeparture from the fundamental truths of Mahayana Buddhism itself.\n\nOn a superficial level, the answer to My\u014de was not difficult for\nH\u014dnen\u2019s followers. Disciples such as Shinran and\nSh\u014dk\u016b affirmed the role of the bodhi-mind in the Pure Land\npath by identifying it with trust in Amida\u2019s vow on the part of\npractitioners. Shinran, for example, distinguishes various types of\nbodhi-mind and identifies that of the true Pure Land path with his\nconception of shinjin. Sh\u014dk\u016b similarly identifies the taking\nof refuge in the vow with bodhi-mind. My\u014de\u2019s criticism,\nhowever, points to the underlying issue of the stark dualism of the\nunenlightened being and the enlightened Buddha in H\u014dnen\u2019s\nteaching. If there is no cause in beings leading to attainment, how\ncan even trust in Amida\u2019s vow arise in them? If they have the\nability to give rise to trust, can they not perform other practices\nalso?\n\nH\u014dnen\u2019s disciples again elaborate diverse conceptions of\ntrust in Amida\u2019s vow, but at bottom there are two elements. That\nwhich is real (suchness, thusness, nondual reality, buddha-nature,\netc.) pervades all beings; nevertheless, beings can come to awareness\nof it only in relation to Amida Buddha, which is manifested in trust\nin the vow. The question of the nature of the relation leads to the\nproblem of hermeneutics.\n4.3 Pure Land Buddhist Hermeneutics\n\nIssues of hermeneutics are central to the Japanese Pure Land tradition\nbecause of the breach it asserts between the ordinary awareness of\nbeings and the enlightened wisdom-compassion of the Buddha, which is\nthe source and ultimate content of the teaching. This is not, of\ncourse, a problem limited to the Pure Land tradition, but has\nengaged Buddhist tradition from the time of Sakyamuni.\nNevertheless, communicating its teaching raises special difficulties\nfor H\u014dnen\u2019s Pure Land thought because of its thoroughly\nnegative assessment of human capacities of comprehension. It views\nhuman understanding as constantly subject to the distortions\nof self-attachment. Thus, for the teaching to be authentically\ngrasped, two conditions must arise. First, the Buddhas\u2014Amida,\nSakyamuni, and the Buddhas of the cosmos\u2014must actively work to\nbridge the gap between dharma and beings\u2019 ignorance, enabling\nbeings\u2019 apprehension of the vow. Second, a shift or transformation of\nawareness must emerge in beings.\n\nThe narrative settings of the Pure Land teachings in the sutras were\nregarded as particularly significant in this regard. The\nContemplation Sutra was especially important in\nH\u014dnen\u2019s interpretation of Amida\u2019s vow, and narratives\nin that sutra were understood to reveal both Sakyamuni\u2019s intent\nin expounding the Pure Land teaching and the proper stance for\nunderstanding it. According to the sutra, the circumstances for\nSakyamuni\u2019s teaching of Amida and his Pure Land relate to the\nstory of Prince Aj\u0101ta\u015batru, who, prompted by the\nBuddha\u2019s jealous cousin Devadatta, usurps the throne by\nmurdering his father and imprisoning his mother Vaidehi. From her\ncell, Vaidehi beseeches the Buddha to teach her a way to be born in a\nworld free of such treachery and turmoil. This leads to\nSakyamuni\u2019s exposition of Amida\u2019s Pure Land.\n\nIn East Asian Pure Land tradition, this royal \u201ctragedy of the\ncapital of R\u0101jag\u1e5bha,\u201d where Sakyamuni often resided\nand preached, was understood to indicate that the Pure Land teaching\nwas intended for ordinary, unenlightened beings in anguished\ncircumstances, rather than for a capable spiritual elite. Shinran\nemphasizes the distance between this world and the realm of\nenlightenment by asserting that at the point in history when\nconditions were ripe for teaching and reception of the Pure Land path,\nthe entire drama of regicide and betrayal was played out by incarnated\nbodhisattvas precisely to allow for the introduction of the Pure Land\nteaching. It is, therefore, the condition of self-reflection and\nrepentance that allows for the reception of the Pure Land teaching. As\nwe have seen, for the Pure Land tradition that H\u014dnen adopted from\nChina, this motif is reiterated in the sutra narrative of the lowest\ngrade of nembutsu practitioner, who has committed evil throughout his\nlife but encounters the teaching through a good friend on his deathbed\nand simply utters Amida\u2019s name ten times.\n\nIn terms of reception, some among H\u014dnen\u2019s disciples further\nemphasized the action of Amida and Sakyamuni in guiding and actively\nbringing beings to trust in the vow. While the Chinzei branch of\nH\u014dnen\u2019s Pure Land school sought to temper the\nmaster\u2019s sweeping rejection of other practices by recognizing\nthe possibility of attaining birth through the various meditative and\nnonmeditative practices set forth in the Contemplation Sutra,\nSh\u014dk\u016b and his Seizan branch taught that the intent of the\nsutra is precisely to lead people to awareness that birth is possible\nonly through the nembutsu. In the latter view, the various\ncontemplative exercises and the disciplines and study taught by the\nsutra are meant to reveal the wisdom-compassion of the vow, which\ngrasps all beings without discrimination, whatever their capacity.\nSince in the sutra beings attain birth regardless of their particular\nlevel or kind of practice, it is not that those practices are being\nprescribed; rather, the sutra intends to show that the actual cause of\nbirth lies not in any such practices, but solely in Amida\u2019s vow.\nIn other words, the sutra teachings are not to be taken literally and\nprescriptively, but as means to awaken beings so that they come to\nentrust themselves to the vow.\n\nIn Shinran, the activity of the vow is more direct, for he asserts\nthat shinjin in beings is itself the mind of Amida and that Amida\ngives his mind to beings. Thus, for example, Shinran interprets the\nnembutsu to be not the invocation of the Buddha by beings but rather\nthe Buddha\u2019s call to beings in order to awaken them.\nSh\u014dk\u016b makes a similar claim, asserting that when a person\ntakes refuge in Amida\u2019s vow, then the Buddha, who is the\nembodiment of perfect practice performed out of the desire to save all\nbeings, enters and becomes one with the person\u2019s aspiration.\nThis oneness manifests itself as the nembutsu. We see in such thinkers\nthat genuine engagement with the teaching is not primarily\nintellectual understanding or simple assent, but a transformative\nencounter in which the dualism of the person\u2019s samsaric\nexistence and Amida\u2019s wisdom-compassion is transcendent.\n4.4 Pure Land Buddhist Ethical Reflection\n\nThe disciples of H\u014dnen who pursued the teaching that birth in the\nPure Land became settled with a single utterance in trust explored the\nreasons this should be so and also its consequences for ongoing life\nin the present. As we have seen, H\u014dnen taught that the vocal\nnembutsu was qualitatively distinct from all other practices, being\neffective as practice because it has been fulfilled by Amida and given\nto beings. Precisely how it was given remained an issue. For disciples\nlike Sh\u014dk\u014d, the nembutsu was determined by Amida but\nretained its quality as practice in that it was to be repeated by a\nperson throughout life, even though a single utterance was taught to\nbe sufficient. Thinkers like Shinran and Sh\u014dk\u016b, however,\nboth understood the utterance of nembutsu to be fulfilled practice\nbecause it arises from the oneness of being and Buddha expressed as\nshinjin or taking refuge. Further, because of this oneness, a\nperson\u2019s attainment of birth in the Pure Land is completely\nsettled in the immediate present.\n\nThe effects of the oneness are manifested not only in the occurrence\nof birth in the Pure Land at death, but also in various ways in\npresent life. Sh\u014dk\u016b speaks of a variety of benefits received\nin the present by the person of the nembutsu, including the\nelimination of the effects of past evil acts, extension of life,\navoidance of various calamities, protection of buddhas, seeing of\nAmida, and so on. One should not pursue such benefits for their own\nsake, but they naturally come about for the person of the nembutsu\nwhose birth in the Pure Land is settled. Thus, to express the\ncondition of the nembutsu practitioner, Sh\u014dk\u016b even\ndistinguishes two types of Pure Land \u201cbirth,\u201d\n\u201cimmediate birth\u201d (sokuben \u014dj\u014d) while\nremaining burdened with afflicting passions in present life and birth\ninto the Pure Land at the time of death (t\u014dtoku\n\u014dj\u014d).\n\nSh\u014dk\u016b\u2019s thinking about ethical life reflects the same\nelements seen in relation to benefits in this life: the person\ncontinues to act out of ignorance and self-attachment, but conduct\nmanifesting oneness with Amida Buddha may also emerge spontaneously.\nHe speaks, for example, of the elimination of the effects of past evil\nacts through repentance (zange metsuzai). He distinguishes,\nhowever, between two kinds or stages of repentance, that which is\ndeliberately undertaken at particular times through ones own powers of\nself-reflection and contrition, but which is difficult to achieve\n(gy\u014dmon no zange), and that which arises spontaneously\nand immediately as the working of the vow (kanmon no zange).\nAs seen here, ethical behavior is not prescribed and undertaken as\nanother form of praxis, but Other Power may function of itself in the\nlife of the nembutsu practitioner to suppress evil and manifest\ncompassion action.\n\nSuch thinking may also be seen in Shinran, who includes, in his list\nof ten benefits obtained by the nembutsu practitioner in the present,\n\u201cconstantly enacting great compassion.\u201d In letters, he\nstates:\n\n\nThose who feel that their own birth is completely settled should,\nmindful of the Buddha\u2019s benevolence, hold the nembutsu in their\nhearts and say it to respond in gratitude to that benevolence, with\nthe wish, \u201cMay there be peace in the world, and may the\nBuddha\u2019s teaching spread!\u201d. (Shinran CWS I: 560)\n\n\nIn the face of the persecution of the nembutsu by local authorities,\nhe advises his disciples:\n\n\nThe people who are trying to obstruct the nembutsu are the manor\nlords, bailiffs, and landowners in the local areas \u2026 .\npracticers of the nembutsu should act with compassion for those who\ncommit such obstruction, feel pity for them, and earnestly say the\nnembutsu, thereby helping those who seek to hinder them. (Shinran CWS\nI: 563\u2013564)\n\n\nFor Shinran, the working of Other Power is precisely the falling away\nof one\u2019s own calculative thinking, seeking religious or worldly\nadvantage through one\u2019s own capacities. Thus, where self-power\nhas been \u201coverturned,\u201d acts spontaneously possessed of\ncompassion arise unprescribed and undeliberated.\n\nFor both Sh\u014dk\u016b and Shinran, the life of the nembutsu\npractitioner is informed by a transformed temporality. This is\nespecially clear in Shinran, who adopts the distinction of two\ndimensions or phases of Amida\u2019s activity\u2014that for\nbeings\u2019 birth in the Pure Land (\u014ds\u014d ek\u014d)\nand that for their immediate return from the Pure Land to this world\nin order to work for the liberation of all beings (gens\u014d\nek\u014d). The ethical ideal of genuinely compassionate\naction\u2014action that leads others to liberation from\nignorance\u2014exists in the present for the nembutsu practitioner as\na goal one looks forward to in the future, beyond all falsification by\nself-attachments. It is the teleological fulfillment of human\nexistence that unfolds only by Other Power. At the same time, that\ngoal, as the content of birth in the Pure Land that is already settled\nin the present, pervades present existence, interfused with the karmic\nburden of the samsaric past. What is authentically known of such a\nself by the nembutsu practitioner, according to both Sh\u014dk\u016b\nand Shinran, is the repentance that is also Amida\u2019s\nwisdom-compassion.\n5. Japanese Pure Land Buddhism\u2019s Encounter with Modernity\n\nThe term modernity commonly indicates the cultural principles\nstemming from the European Enlightenment that became dominant globally\nin the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including such\nideals as reason, empirical science, individualism, freedom, and so\non. Japan\u2019s encounter with modernity represents a particularly\nclear and well-defined case, for up until the mid-nineteenth century,\nJapan had an official policy of isolation, restricting all\ninternational contact. Political stability, including religious\ninstitutions, had continued without significant threat or conflict for\nnearly two and a half centuries, during which a relatively peaceful,\nprosperous, and culturally active citizenry flourished. After being\nforcibly opened to foreign commerce in 1853, Japanese leaders emerged\nwho were fearful of the efforts by Western powers to exert control\nover the country through utilizing internal conflict. They sought\nfundamental political change without large-scale civil warfare and\nsuccessfully effected a shift in power from the shogunate nominally to\nthe emperor in 1868. Further, they entered upon a deliberate program\nof importing and adopting Western learning, technology, and\nsociopolitical institutions. Christianity was perceived as woven into\nthe fabric of modern civilization and as providing the moral\nfoundation for Western advances. Hence, some Japanese believed the\nsuccessful assimilation of Western technology and social institution\nwould require the adoption of Christianity.\n5.1 Christian Critique of Pure Land Buddhism\n\nDuring the four decades from the opening of Japan to about the time of\nthe World\u2019s Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893, Buddhist\ninstitutions were forced into a largely defensive posture in the face\nof programs for radical social change and the influx of Christian\nmissionizing. Buddhist reform movements were beginning to arise, but\non the whole it was a period for regrouping, apologetics, and new\norganizational rather than intellectual development. The observations\nand criticisms by Christian missionaries regarding Japanese Buddhism\nduring this period reveal the challenges to which Buddhists sought to\nrespond. An example is a lecture delivered by M. L. Gordon\n(1844\u20131900), a Congregational missionary and teacher, to the\n\u201cGeneral Conference of the Protestant Missionaries of\nJapan\u201d in Osaka in 1883. To more than one hundred missionaries,\nGordon, a scholar of Japanese Buddhism and author of tracts in both\nJapanese and English, discussed \u201cthe religious influence of\nBuddhism as an obstacle to the reception of the Gospel in Japan\u201d\n(Gordon 1883). He notes that in the modernizing Japan of his time,\n\u201cthere are many among the educated classes who not only have no\nsympathy with Buddhism but violently hate it.\u201d Still, he\nbelieved Buddhism remained the primary impediment to missionizing.\nMoreover, he identified Pure Land Buddhism, specifically the Shin\nBuddhism (J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b) in the tradition of Shinran\u2019s\nthought, as \u201cthe most popular and flourishing\u201d of Buddhist\nschools. Gordon\u2019s critique of Japanese Buddhism, and of Shin\nBuddhism in particular, highlights issues that Buddhist thinkers have\ncontinued to grapple with in the modern era up to today: reasoned\nunderstanding in the face of modern knowledge, existential engagement,\nand social action.\n\nGordon\u2019s attack on Pure Land Buddhism begins with the assertion\nthat it \u201cis not the Buddhism which Gotama taught\u201d and,\ngoing even further, that \u201cthe Buddhism taught by the Shin sect\nof Japan is in some respects exactly opposed to the teaching of\nShakya\u201d (Gordon 1882, p. 108). Utilizing contemporaneous\nEuropean scholarship in Sanskrit and Pali, Gordon lists contradictions\nbetween \u201cBuddhism as Gotama taught it\u201d and \u201cthe\nso-called Mahayana\u201d teachings, which \u201care perversions\nrather than denials of the truth, and hence are all the more\ndangerous.\u201d The problem Gordon encounters is partly a rift with\nWestern rationality\u2014what he calls the ability \u201cfor the\nBuddhist mind to look a logical contradiction squarely in the face\nwithout recognizing it.\u201d Even more important to him, however,\nare how the perceived deviations in the Pure Land tradition that have\ntransformed \u201coriginal Buddhism\u201d into a religion in the\nmode of Christianity.\n\nGordon adduces \u201cthe three great biblical doctrines\u201d that\nfor him evince Christianity\u2019s superiority over Japanese\nBuddhism: \u201cGod, Sin, and Salvation.\u201d These touch on the\nphilosophical issues of ontology, anthropology, and ethics that we\nhave considered, and adumbrate the topics Japanese Buddhists would\ntake up and continue to tackle into the twentieth century. Gordon\nbegins by remarking on \u201cthe difficulty of bringing the Buddhist\nto an adequate conception of God.\u201d Here, the concept of God as\ncreator is pivotal for Gordon, in part because it identifies in God a\nunique transcendence not present in the conceptions of Buddhas. As\nJapanese Buddhists pointed out in their first encounters with\nChristianity, the notion of divine incarnation fits easily into a\nbroad Japanese Buddhist paradigm of the emergence of form from\nformless reality. In Gordon\u2019s words, \u201cThe doctrine of the\nIncarnation may be referred to \u2026 as having been greatly\ndegraded by Buddhism. Incarnations are frequent.\u201d Further,\nrelated to emergence or manifestation is the ontological ambiguity of\nnonduality. Hence Gordon finds, perhaps with some frustration, that\n\u201cif we were to ask the priest who preaches this [Pure Land]\ndoctrine \u2026 whether Amida really exists or not, he would perhaps\nafter some squirming admit that either view of the case is perfectly\nadmissible.\u201d\n\nFor Gordon, God as creator serves as the linchpin for the other two\nkey doctrines, sin and salvation. In lacking a conception of creator,\nBuddhism \u201crecognizes no supreme and intelligent Ruler and Judge\nof the universe.\u201d This leads to \u201conly a very inadequate\nidea of sin,\u201d one that trivializes it and in fact promotes\n\u201cimmorality.\u201d A further consequence is that salvation in\nBuddhism is \u201csalvation from the misery of the present world\nrather than salvation from sin.\u201d Pure Land Buddhism, in other\nwords, denigrates the significance of present life and looks only to\nthe promise of deliverance in the future.\n\nChristianity\u2019s challenge to Japanese Buddhists involved what\nGordon expressed as \u201cpower over the hearts and lives of\nmen,\u201d which had not necessarily been sought by the Japanese\ntemple priests whose chief duty was to the calendar of memorial\nceremonies. In his autobiographical account of his ministry, Gordon\nspeaks of his converts\u2019 testimony about the depth of their\nexperiences. He states: \u201cA powerful impression of [sin] as a\npersonal burden is not common. One old lady testified that she had\nhardly thought of herself as a sinner, until she began to hear this\n\u2018new way.\u2019 \u2026 Christianity alone brings true\nrepentance\u201d (Gordon 1893, pp. 213\u2013214).\n\nGordon further states, \u201cChristianity makes loving service to\nmankind more prominent than other religions.\u201d The\nmissionaries\u2019 challenge to articulate both a personal and a\ncorporate, social ethic roused the Buddhists to establish schools,\nhospitals, and various kinds of chaplaincies.\n5.2 The Modernization of Buddhist Thought: Intellectual Reform\n\nThe Japanese Buddhist response to modernity from the beginning of the\ntwentieth century tended to be dominated by two interrelated trends:\nthe attempt to reinterpret the nature of the Buddhist and Christian\ntraditions and the relationship between them, and the attempt to\nmodernize Buddhist teachings by adopting modes of understanding\nreligious life discerned in Western thought and Christian conceptual\nmotifs.\n\nUntil the latter half of the nineteenth century, there were no terms\nin Japanese corresponding to the abstract categories of\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d and \u201creligion.\u201d Nevertheless, the\nstudy of Western philosophy began to be diligently pursued, even\nbefore the Meiji restoration, as an important body of Western learning\ncrucial for modern Japan, an accompaniment to the natural sciences.\nThe accepted term corresponding to \u201creligion,\u201d\nsh\u016bky\u014d\u5b97\u6559, came into use as the\nstandard equivalent for the Western concept from the 1860\u2019s,\nwhen it was required for the translation of diplomatic documents\nexchanged with Western nations. In terms of actual content, therefore,\nit was at first closely associated with Christianity.\n\nFor Buddhists, philosophy and religion became a means not only to\nposition Buddhism in relation to Christianity, but also to distance it\nfrom Christianity to its own advantage, particularly in relation to\nmodern scientific knowledge. The central figure here was Inoue\nEnry\u014d (1858\u20131919), who was born into the family of a Pure Land\ntemple priest of the Shin Buddhist tradition and was active throughout\nhis life as an educator and public intellectual.\n\nInoue\u2019s strategy was to view Buddhism as a religion in the mode\nof a philosophy. He employed both categories in characterizing the\naims and approach of Buddhism, seeking to demonstrate its superiority\nto Christianity. On the one hand, Buddhism shares the core concern of\nall religion, which is \u201cthe world of the absolute\u201d\n(zettai sekai): \u201cReligion teaches the way for our\nrelative mind to enter into the absolute world. In Buddhism, this is\nnamely the overturning of delusional thought and the awakening of\nenlightenment. Delusional thought indicates the finite, while\nenlightenment signifies the infinite\u201d (Meishin to\nSh\u016bky\u014d [Superstition and Religion], 1916, quoted in\nJosephson 2012, p. 159). On the other hand, when the superstitious\npractices that have attached themselves to Buddhist life are stripped\naway, its fundamental mode of thought, rooted in reason and causality,\nis seen to resemble scientific and philosophical thought. In this, it\nis distinct from Christianity, which Inoue believes is grounded in\nrevelation and divine creation. To counter the notion of creationism\nthat Gordon proposed as the foundation of genuine religion, Japanese\nBuddhists drew on the Western science of evolution as the razor that\nwould shear superstition from a more properly\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d version of religion.\n\nInoue draws on concepts and frameworks that were current in the West\nin the field of \u201ccomparative religion\u201d or the\n\u201cscientific study of religion.\u201d Max M\u00fcller, whose\nthinking informed the spirit of the World\u2019s Parliament of\nReligions in which a number of Japanese Buddhists participated, speaks\nof a human faith in the infinite or absolute within the historical\nworld, and of the \u201cstruggle to conceive the inconceivable\u201d\n(Introduction to the Science of Religions, 1870, quoted in\nKetelaar 1990, p. 146). This language was seen to resonate with the\nBuddhist tradition, providing it with broad categories by which\nJapanese Buddhists were able to situate their traditions in modern,\nphilosophically recognizable frameworks.\n5.3 Existential Engagement with Pure Land Buddhism\n\nThe aforementioned M. L. Gordon had claimed that an experiential\nconversion\u2014\u201ca deep personal loathing of sin\u201d or\nawareness of \u201ca certain and present forgiveness of\nsin\u201d\u2014is the hallmark of the genuinely religious. That\nconversion experience, he maintained, lends Christianity a power\nlacking in Japanese Buddhism, which he saw as moribund and widely\ndiscredited in modern times. Admittedly, the Christian concepts of sin\nand forgiveness are absent from Pure Land Buddhism. Yet, some Buddhist\nthinkers felt challenged to develop the practical dimension of the\nPure Land tradition, even while adopting Inoue\u2019s philosophical\nterminology. They accepted the Christian critique, acknowledging the\nChristian strength as indispensable for, in Gordon\u2019s expression,\n\u201ca living religion.\u201d\n\nThe representative Japanese Buddhist figure here is the Pure Land\npriest Kiyozawa Manshi (1863\u20131903), a younger associate of Inoue who\nhad also studied Western philosophy at Tokyo Imperial University.\nDespite his early death, Kiyozawa\u2019s efforts to democratize and\nmodernize the Shin Buddhist temple institution deeply influenced\nsucceeding thinkers of the Higashi Honganji tradition. Like Inoue, he\nspeaks of the finite and infinite (or absolute) as mediated by reason\nin philosophy and by faith in religion. Kiyozawa is distinctive,\nthough, in his decidedly practical orientation, exploring the\nencounter with the absolute in religious life. In his late twenties,\nhe undertook an ascetic discipline of daily life and diet that ended\nafter several years when he contracted tuberculosis. In the last five\nyears of his life, he was strongly attracted to the introspective\nspiritual cultivation of equanimity and indifference to contingencies\nthat he found in the early scriptures of Buddhism and especially in\nthe Stoic philosopher Epictetus.\n\nAlthough Kiyozawa makes little mention of Christianity in his writings\nbeyond, for example, reflections on the doctrines of creation or\nmonotheism from a comparative philosophical perspective, we find in\nhis journal in 1898, amid passages from Epictetus and other classical\ntexts, references to biblical passages in standard English notation.\nIn relation to the notion \u201cGod is in man,\u201d which he\nconsiders \u201can old doctrine\u201d found in classical Western\nauthors, Kiyozawa gives references to five Bible passages, including:\n\u201cDo you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy\nSpirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?\u201d (I Cor.\n6:19); \u201cGuard the good deposit that was entrusted to\nyou\u2014guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in\nus\u201d (2 Tim. 1:4); \u201cNo one has ever seen God; but if we\nlove one another, God lives in us \u2026 He has given us of his\nSpirit\u201d (I John 3:12\u201313).\n\nThe references suggest a close familiarity with the Bible, probably\nfrom his youth. Although Kiyozawa makes no reference to Christianity\nitself in this context, in his pursuit of immediate experience, in his\nprobing self-examination, and in his works for institutional and\neducational reform, he appears almost to embody a Buddhist response to\nGordon\u2019s accusation that Buddhism lacks the power to influence\ndaily life and ethical social action. Toward the end of his life,\nKiyozawa created a Buddhist movement for the quest of \u201cspiritual\nliving\u201d (seishin-shugi), which he defines in terms of\nthe personal encounter with the absolute.\n\nIn Kiyozawa\u2019s disciple Soga Ry\u014djin (1875\u20131971), also a Shin\nBuddhist priest, we find the same interest in articulating the\npersonal immediacy of religious teachings. Instead of seeking, like\nhis teacher, to build on the legitimacy of philosophy and science,\ncarving out a place for Buddhism beyond the limitations of a rational\nphilosophical analysis of life experience, Soga stood within Shin\nBuddhist teachings and sought to show their vital significance. He did\nso by drawing on broader Mahayana Buddhist concepts, comparing them at\ntimes with Christian modes of thought.\n\nIn an article for fellow missionaries explaining Amida Buddha and the\nPure Land, Gordon quotes Rhys Davids in characterizing them as\n\u201chypothetical beings, the creations of a sickly scholasticism,\nhollow abstractions without life or reality\u201d (\u201cThe Legend\nof Amida\u201d). In the 1880s, Christian missionaries undoubtedly\nfelt confident that to expose Pure Land teachings as\n\u201ctales\u201d unknown to Gotama would lead to the dismantling of\n\u201cthe most powerful sect in Japan.\u201d Pure Land Buddhists\nwere keenly aware of such criticism, and it may have prompted Soga and\nothers to ponder Christian ideas in exploring the existential,\nreligious meaning of Pure Land teachings. While temple institutions\nhad pursued the study of Christian theology for polemical purposes, it\nappears that by the turn of the twentieth century, some Buddhist\nphilosophers had gained a new confidence of their own, allowing\nthemselves to be stimulated by Christian theological ideas.\n\nIn one of his seminal essays, \u201cSavior on Earth,\u201d Soga\nbegins:\n\nIn the first part of July last year (1912), \u2026 I intuited the\nphrase, \u201cThe Tathagata (Amida) is myself,\u201d and in the\nlatter part of August, \u2026 the phrase, \u201cThe Tathagata\nbecomes me and saves me,\u201d was bestowed on me. Finally, about\nOctober, I was brought to realize that \u201c\u2018The Tathagata\nbecomes me\u2019 signifies the birth of Dharmakara\nBodhisattva.\u201d (Blum and Rhodes 2011, p. 107, translation\nmodified)\n\n\nThis essay was published in 1913 in the magazine begun by Kiyozawa,\nSeishinkai (The World of Spiritual Living), fifteen years\nafter Kiyozawa\u2019s journal references to the Bible quoted above.\nAlthough Soga is spoken of as \u201carguably the most innovative\nthinker in modern Shin Buddhist history\u201d by sectarian scholars,\nand although he employs the traditional Shin term \u201cdirected [by\nAmida]\u201d (ek\u014d) in speaking of the source of his\n\u201crevelation,\u201d it is highly likely that Soga had been\ntesting how Christian ideas might help in developing Shin teachings.\nThe term \u201csavior\u201d (ky\u016bshu) in Soga\u2019s\ntitle is widely used for Jesus Christ, and in comparative remarks in\nthe essay, Soga asserts that the unique incarnation as Jesus limits\nGod\u2019s salvific power to Jesus personally, while Dharmakara is\nborn in each person and becomes \u201cthe true subjectivity of the\nself in the desire for salvation.\u201d\n\nSoga not only counters criticisms that Amida is merely mythical and\nthat Pure Land Buddhism lacks historical foundations, but also\nstrongly affirms in doctrinal terms the immediacy of personal\nreligious experience in Shin. Christian concepts related to kenosis,\nincarnation in historical time, and trinity may have stimulated\nSoga\u2019s rethinking of the relationship between the practitioner\nand Amida. There is also the matter of the temporal dimension in this\nrelationship. Previously the Japanese Pure Land tradition had\narticulated the Mahayana logic of the nonduality of the temporal and\nthe uncreated (or transtemporal). That said, the Christian critique\nand Augustinian concepts of time and eternity may also have inspired\nSoga\u2019s interpretation of the vast time spans in the narrative of\nDharmakara\u2019s vows and practice. As Soga explains:\n\nPeople are apt to consider this as an old tale that has nothing to do\nwith their present selves. In fact, however, the one-moment wherein\nDharmakara Bodhisattva evoked the faith of sincere entrusting is an\nabsolute moment that embraces innumerable eons. And equally the first\nmoment wherein we are made to experience faith is an absolute moment\nthat covers innumerable eons \u2026 . The present of faith is the\ngreat present of immeasurable life. (Blum and Rhodes 2011, p. 115)\n\n\nThe philosopher Nishitani Keiji (1900\u20131990) also articulates\nShinran\u2019s treatment of time in terms of the nondiscrimination or\nsimultaneity of the temporal and the timeless or eternal (Nishitani\n1978).\n\nChristianity challenged Japanese Buddhists by teaching a personal\nreligiosity and a stringent individual moral responsibility. Kiyozawa\noffers a prominent example of the attempt to engage those issues.\nRegarding the narrative of the origin of Amida Buddha and the Pure\nLand, which Gordon and other Christian missionaries regarded as\nobvious fictions created late in the Buddhist tradition, Soga may have\nfound resources for resolution in the very Christian sources behind\nthe criticisms. The Japanese Mahayana tradition had already developed\nit own concepts of the compassionate emergence out of emptiness or\nformless reality as well as the nonduality of the karmically\nconditioned and unconditioned. Those ideas provided an openness to and\npoint of entry into certain areas of Christian and Western\nphilosophical thought. During the twentieth century, philosophers such\nas Nishida Kitar\u014d, Tanabe Hajime, Nishitani Keiji, Takeuchi\nYoshinori, and Abe Masao have drawn on both the Christian and Japanese\nBuddhist traditions, particularly Pure Land and Zen, in engaging\nmodern philosophical issues.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Genshin, 1973. <em>The Teachings Essential for Rebirth : A Study\nof Genshin\u2019s \u014cj\u014dy\u014dsh\u016b</em>, Allan A.\nAndrews, Tokyo: Sophia University.
