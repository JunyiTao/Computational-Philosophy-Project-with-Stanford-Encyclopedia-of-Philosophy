    "main_text": "Principles to Guide Behavior in International and Global Matters || What Global Duties Do We Have?\n2.2 What Global Duties Do We Have?\n\nOne of the most visible and large-scale contemporary global justice\nproblems we face is that of global poverty. What ought we to do for\nthe 1 billion or so people who currently live in poverty? This is a\nhuge area nicely canvassed in the entry on\n international distributive justice.\n A few seminal arguments deserve mention here as well, however. In a\nclassic argument Peter Singer describes a so-called easy rescue case\nin which an infant is drowning in a shallow pond. You happen by and\ncan save the child with minimal effort and inconvenience on your part.\nSinger argues that you would be obligated to assist using the\nprinciple that when it is in our power to prevent something bad from\nhappening without sacrificing anything significant or comparable, it\nis wrong not to prevent the bad from occurring. So, Singer argues that\nwe have extensive duties to assist needy others, whether they be\ngeographically proximate or not. We have extensive duties to assist\nthe global poor who, with equally minimal effort on our part, can be\nsaved from dire circumstances, since the same principle applies in\nboth cases (Singer 1972). (For more treatment see Unger 1996 and for\ncriticism see Lichtenberg 2013).\n\nThomas Pogge offers another influential contribution in World\nPoverty and Human Rights. He argues that since developed\ncountries impose a coercive global order on the poor that foreseeably\nand avoidably causes great harm, they have important responsibilities\nto reform the global order such that it ceases to do so and instead\nbetter secures human rights (Pogge 2002, 2008, 2010). We harm the\nglobal poor when we collaborate in imposing an unjust global\ninstitutional order on them and, moreover, that order is unjust when\nit foreseeably perpetuates large-scale human rights deficits that can\nreasonably be avoided were we to make quite feasible institutional\nmodifications (Pogge 2002, 2008, 2010). We also harm the poor when we\ndeprive them of their resources and through a shared and violent\nhistory (Pogge 2008). While Singer emphasizes our capacity to assist\nwith need satisfaction, Pogge emphasizes instead our contributions to\nthe problem as grounding our duties.\n\nWhen discussing our duties to one another there is also vigorous\ndebate about what the content and target of our duties should be,\nalong with discussion about what are the best ways to discharge these.\nTraditional dominant economic approaches to promoting prosperity have\nfocused on raising income levels or increasing Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP). Railing against such approaches, Amartya Sen suggested that the\ncapabilities approach provides an improved measure of well-being and\nconstitutes a better way to capture changes in people\u2019s\ncondition over time (Sen 1980). Exploring what people are able to do\nand be provides a more appropriate standard by which to evaluate\nwhether their condition has improved rather than focusing exclusively\non their incomes or per capita GDP. Martha Nussbaum develops this\napproach and argues for a list of ten capabilities that should be\nsecured for all people in all places. This universal list can provide\nan important tool in persuading governments to make reforms conducive\nto their citizens\u2019 flourishing. (See the entry on\n the capability approach\n for more.) Another important discourse for discussing duties is that\nof human rights which is discussed in\n Section 2.4\n below. Before we continue it is important to mention that there are\nmany possible ways to understand the content of our duties to one\nanother. (For more see entries on\n egalitarianism,\n equality,\n sufficiency,\n capability theory,\n well-being,\n and\n needs in moral and political philosophy).\n The issue of our duties to one another is a vast topic and we\ncontinue to discuss it throughout this entry. This section serves only\nas an introduction.\n",
