Efficient (Productive) Causation\n\nTo understand Leibniz\u2019s theory of intrasubstantial causality\nbetter (and also to acquaint ourselves with some interpretive\ndifficulties), let us first focus on considerations having to do with\nefficient causation. Then we will discuss final and formal\ncausation.\n\nA point of terminological clarification is needed. According to\nLeibniz, the terms \u2018efficiently cause\u2019 and\n\u2018produce\u2019 are synonymous: \u201cIt must be admitted that\nin saying that \u2018efficient cause\u2019 is what produces and\n\u2018effect\u2019 is what is produced, you are merely dealing in\nsynonyms\u201d (New Essays A vi, 6, 228). Elsewhere, Leibniz\ndefines \u2018efficient cause\u2019 as \u2018active cause\u2019 (A\nvi, 2, 490; C 472).\n\nNow, Leibniz consistently refers to the causal efficacy or\nproductivity of substances. Consider the following texts:\n\n\n\u2026 the modifications which can occur to a single subject\nnaturally and without miracles must arise from limitations and\nvariations of a real genus, that is, of a constant and absolute\ninherent nature. (New Essays A vi, 6, 65 (1702))\n\nAnything which occurs in what is strictly a substance must be a case\nof action in the metaphysically rigorous sense of something which\noccurs in the substance spontaneously arising out [arrive] of its own\ndepths. (New Essays A vi, 6, 210)\n\n\u2026 free or intelligent substances possess something greater and\nmore marvelous, in a kind of imitation of God. For they are not bound\nby any certain subordinate laws of the universe, but act by a private\nmiracle as it were, on the sole initiative of their own power\u2026\n(\u201cNecessary and Contingent Truths\u201d C 10/PM 100 (1686))\n\n\u2026 why should God be unable to give substance, from the\nbeginning, a nature or an internal force that can produce [produire]\nin it, in an orderly way\u2026all the appearance or expressions it\nwill have, without the help of any created being? This is especially\nso since the nature of substance necessarily requires and essentially\ninvolves progress or change, without which it would not have the force\nto act. (New System GP iv, 485 (1695))\n\n\nWhether passive substances truly exist or not, active agencies\n\u201care responsible for whatever activity is attributed to the\nformer\u201d (Shapere, 45). Leibniz\u2019s principle (which has it\nancestors principally in Stoicism) is this: \u201cWhatever is\nfundamentally explanatory must be an active principle\u201d (Shapere,\n45). The purely passive cannot do anything unless it is acted upon. At\ntimes, Leibniz seems to think that only the truly active exists:\n\u201cwe can show from the inner truths of metaphysics that what is\nnot active is nothing, for there is no such thing as a mere\npotentiality to act without any initial action\u201d (\u201cOn the\nTrue Method in Philosophy and Theology\u201d W 64 (1686)). If all\nthings that exist are substances, and the essence of substance is\nactivity, then passive \u201csubstances\u201d do not truly exist,\nsince they are passive, that is, not active (Shapere, 46).\n\nConsider this passage where Leibniz not only attributes causal\nefficacy or activity to finite substances, but also causal efficiency\nor productivity:\n\nBayle asserts, for instance, that by purely philosophical meditations\none can never attain to an established certainty that we are the\nefficient cause [la cause efficiente] of our volitions. But\nthis is a point which I do not concede to him: for the establishment\nof this system demonstrates beyond a doubt that in the course of\nnature each substance is the sole cause of all its actions, and that\nit is free of all physical influence from every other substance, save\nthe customary cooperation of God. (Theodicy \u00a7300)\n\n\nHowever, Nicholas Jolley, among others, insists that \u201c[a]lthough\nLeibniz may say that it is substances which produce their states, this\nis only a loose way of speaking\u201d (Jolley 1998, 605). Strictly\nspeaking, according to Jolley, substance A caused\nperceptual state p2 is shorthand for there is some\nperceptual state p1 such that\np1 involves A and\np1 causes p2 (Jolley 1998, 605). But\ndoes Leibniz indeed take perceptions or perceptual states to be\nefficient causes? The answer is surprisingly unclear. One problem is\nthat (almost) invariably the language Leibniz employs to describe the\nrelationship among perceptions or perceptual states is not explicitly\ncausal (in the efficient or productive sense at least). Leibniz\npredominantly uses terms such as \u2018consequence\u2019,\n\u2018suite\u2019, \u2018sequitur\u2019,\n\u2018r\u00e9sultat\u2019, \u2018tend\u2019, and\n\u2018derivantur\u2019, when speaking of the passage from one\nperceptual state to another (GP ii 47, 91f, 372; GP iv 440, 521),\nterms which should make us hesitate in automatically attributing to\nLeibniz a theory of causally efficacious perceptions or perceptual\nstates. Consider the following representative sample of texts:\n\n\n\u2026 every present state of a substance occurs to it spontaneously\nand is only a consequence of [une suite de] its preceding\nstate. (Remarks on a Letter to Arnauld, GP ii, 47)\n\nEverything occurs in each substance in consequence of [en\nconsequence du] the first state that God gave it in creating it\n\u2026 (Letter to Arnauld, April 30, 1687, GP ii, 91)\n\n\u2026 all our future thoughts and perceptions are merely\nconsequences [que des suites], thought contingent, of our\npreceding thoughts and perceptions (Discourse on Metaphysics\n\u00a714 GP iv, 440)\n\n\u2026 the present state of each substance is a natural result\n[consequence] of its preceding state\u2026\n(Clarification of Difficulties concerning Monsieur Bayle, GP\niv, 521)\n\n\u2026 every present perception leads to [que la suite de]\na new perception\u2026 (Theodicy \u00a7403)\n\n\u2026 subsequent [perceptions] are derived\n[derivantur] from preceding ones (Letter to Des Bosses, GP\nii, 372 (1709))\n\n\nThis is just not the kind of language we should expect to find from\nLeibniz when speaking of efficient or productive causes. Further, when\nLeibniz does claim that perceptions or perceptual states produce other\nstates, it\u2019s difficult to determine if such a claim is to be\ntaken strictly. Consider these claims:\n\n\nAnd really it can be said that the representation of the end in the\nmind is the efficient cause of the representation of the means in the\nsame mind. (Notes on Stahl 1702, D ii, 2, 134)\n\n\u2026 the representation of the present state of the universe in\nthe soul of the dog will produce in it the representation of the\nfollowing state of the same universe, just as in objects the preceding\nstate effectively produces the following state of the world. In a\nsoul, the representations of causes are the causes of the\nrepresentations of effects. (GP iv, 533/WF 78)\n\n\nLaurence Carlin takes these passages to mean that \u201cdeliberation\nof means depends on perceptions of ends in the sense that the latter\nare the efficient causes of the former\u201d (Carlin, 226). Now,\nneither the term \u201cperception\u201d nor \u201cperceptual\nstate\u201d is used in these passages, but in alignment with\nCarlin\u2019s interpretation Leibniz defines perception as \u201cthe\ninternal state of the monad representing external objects\u201d\n(Principles of Nature and Grace \u00a74) and \u201cthe\ntransitory state that involves and represents a multiplicity in the\nunity\u201d (Monadology \u00a714). One problem with Carlin\u2019s\ninterpretation of these passages, however, is that there is another\npassage from the Theodicy that may indicate that these\npassages are not to be taken strictly:\n\nWhen we say that an intelligent substance is moved by the goodness of\nits object, we do not assert that this object is necessarily a being\nexisting outside the substance, and it is enough for us that it be\nconceivable: for its representation acts in the substance, or rather\n[ou plut\u00f4t] the substance acts upon itself, insofar as\nit is disposed and influenced by this representation. (Remarks on\nKing \u00a721 in Theodicy; my emphasis)\n\n\nThis passage can be read to mean that speaking of a substance\u2019s\nrepresentation acting (as an efficient cause) is only a loose way of\nspeaking; strictly speaking, it is the substance, or better, power of\nthe substance, that acts in accordance with this representation\n(presumably functioning as a final cause). More on this issue in the\nsection on final causation, but the main point is that textually it is\ndifficult to know whether or not Leibniz takes perceptions or\nperceptual states to be efficient causes. Of course, all of the texts\nadduced up to this point could accommodate the view that for Leibniz\nperceptions or perceptual states function as efficient causes, for\nwhile the terms \u2018consequence\u2019 and\n\u2018derivantur\u2019, for instance, do not entail efficient\ncausation, they are still compatible with it.\n\nHowever, the above texts aside, there is a philosophical worry with\nattributing efficiency or productivity to perceptions on\nLeibniz\u2019s metaphysics. The question is whether perceptions can\nfunction as active agencies (and so efficient causes) for Leibniz. In\nLeibniz\u2019s ontology, what is active is a true, enduring unity and\na center of force\u2014namely, a substance. Leibniz writes that\n\u201ceverything that acts is an individual substance\u201d\n(\u201cOn Nature Itself\u201d AG 160). To understand perceptions and\nperceptual states as causally ordered, in the sense that efficient\ncausal and not merely lawful or regular or final causal relations\nobtain among them, is to subscribe to an event oriented model\nof causation. But Leibniz, not only like his medieval predecessors but\nalso many of his contemporaries, subscribes to a rather different\nmodel\u2014one in which a real cause must be a substance or\na power of that substance. (More on this in the section on\ncausal models.) Therefore, unless perceptions are genuine substances\nand so not events, it seems to follow that for Leibniz, perceptions\n(and perceptual states) are causally inefficacious.\n",
