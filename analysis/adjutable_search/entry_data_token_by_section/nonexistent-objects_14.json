    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Nonexistent Objects: From Nonexistence to Abstractness || The Dual Copula Strategy\n5.5 The Dual Copula Strategy\n\nAccording to the dual copula strategy, there are two kinds of\nrelations between properties and\n individuals.[35]\n Different advocates of this strategy use different terminologies for\nit. Here are some of them:\n\nThe golden mountain is determined by the property of\nbeing golden and by the property of being a mountain.\n\nThe golden mountain satisfies the property of being\nincompletely determined. (Mally 1912)\nThe golden mountain has the property of being golden and\nthe property of being a mountain assigned to it.\n\nThe golden mountain immanently contains the property of\nbeing incompletely determined. (Ingarden 1931 [1973], \u00a720, p.\n122)\nThe golden mountain is consociated with the property of\nbeing golden and the property of being a mountain.\nThe golden mountain is consubstantiated with the\nproperty of being incompletely determined. (Casta\u00f1eda\n1972)\nThe property of being golden and the property of being a\nmountain are ascribed to the golden mountain.\n\nThe golden mountain has the property of being\nincompletely determined. (van Inwagen\n 1977)[36]\nThe golden mountain is constituted by the properties of\nbeing golden and being a mountain.\n\nThe golden mountain exemplifies the property of being\nincompletely determined. (Rapaport 1978)\nThe golden mountain encodes the property of being golden\nand the property of being a mountain.\nThe golden mountain exemplifies the property of being\nincompletely determined. (Zalta 1983)\n\n\nThe various versions of the dual copula strategy share the assumption\nthat the copula \u201cis\u201d is ambiguous. In what follows, we\nwill use the exemplification-encoding terminology. In addition, we\nwill borrow from Zalta the following notational convention:\n\u201c\\(Fb\\)\u201d stands for \u201c\\(b\\)\nexemplifies the property of being \\(F\\)\u201d.\n\u201c\\(bF\\)\u201d stands for \u201c\\(b\\)\nencodes the property of being \\(F\\)\u201d. Furthermore,\nwe will use MOT\\(^{dc}\\) as an abbreviation for \u201cthe revised\nversion of Meinongian object theory which makes use of a dual copula\ndistinction\u201d.\n\nAccording to MOT\\(^{dc}\\), the object called \u201cthe round\nsquare\u201d is the object that encodes the property of being round\nand the property of being square (and all of the properties that are\nimplied by these properties) and no other properties. Thus, according\nto MOT\\(^{dc}\\), the object called \u201cthe round square\u201d\nis \\(\\iota x\\forall F(xF \\equiv R \\Rightarrow F \\vee S \\Rightarrow F)\\).\n\nThus, according to MOT\\(^{dc}\\), the object called \u201cthe\nround square\u201d encodes exactly two constitutive properties (being\nround and being square). However, over and above this, there are many\n(indeed infinitely many) properties that are\nexemplified by this object, for instance: the property of not\nbeing red, the property of not encoding the property of being red, the\nproperty of not being determined with respect to its side length, the\nproperty of having thought of by Bertrand Russell, the property of\nencoding exactly two constitutive properties, the property of being\nincompletely determined.\n\nTo mention another popular example, consider Pegasus: Among other\nthings, Pegasus encodes the properties of being a horse, of having\nwings, of having been tamed by Bellerophon. But there are also\ninfinitely many properties that Pegasus exemplifies, for instance, the\nproperty of not being determined with respect to the number of hairs\nin its tail, the property of being a character of Greek mythology, the\nproperty of being a fictitious object.\n\nIt must be emphasized that something that encodes the property of\nbeing a horse is not a horse (in the usual predicative sense\nof \u201cis\u201d). Analogously, something that encodes the\nproperties of being round and square is neither round nor square. That\nis to say, something that encodes the property of being a horse does\nnot belong to the class of horses, and something that encodes the\nproperties of being round and square does neither belong to the class\nof round things nor to the class of square things. Rather, things that\nencode the properties of being a horse or being a square or being a\nDanish prince are abstract objects\u2014abstract in the\nsense that they are neither mental nor spatio-temporal things. In\ngeneral, everything which encodes at least one property is an abstract\nobject in this\n sense.[37]\n\nLet\u2019s see how MOT\\(^{dc}\\) avoids the alleged paradoxes\nmentioned in section 4. The first objection was that objects like the\nround square infringe the law of contradiction, since such objects\nwould be both round and not round. According to MOT\\(^{dc}\\),\nhowever, the object called \u201cthe round\nsquare\u201d\u2014\\(\\iota x\\forall F(xF \\equiv R \\Rightarrow F \\vee S \\Rightarrow F)\\)\u2014is not round (i.e., does not exemplify the property\nof being round). Thus, no contradiction arises.\n\nThe second objection was that the existent golden mountain would\ninfringe the law of contradiction, since, if there were such an\nobject, it would be both existent and nonexistent. According to\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\), one could answer to this objection as follows: The\nobject called \u201cthe existent golden mountain\u201d is\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(xF \\equiv G \\Rightarrow F \\vee M \\Rightarrow F \\vee \\rE! \\Rightarrow F)\\). This object encodes the property of being\nexistent, but it does not exemplify it. Since\n\u201c\\(b\\) encodes \\(F\\)\u201d does not imply\n\u201c\\(b\\) exemplifies \\(F\\)\u201d, there is no\ncontradiction involved here.\n\nAccording to MOT\\(^{dc}\\), the object blue is\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(xF \\equiv B \\Rightarrow F)\\), i.e., the object that encodes exclusively the\nproperties that are implied by being blue. Thus, the object\nblue exemplifies the property of encoding only the\nproperties that are implied by being blue. It is not the case that the\nobject blue has exactly one property and at the same time has\nat least two properties, at least not, if \u201chas\u201d is used in\nthe same sense in both occurrences. In this way, the apparent\ncontradiction disappears.\n\nFurthermore, according to MOT\\(^{dc}\\), the object called\n\u201cthe round square\u201d, i.e.,\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(xF \\equiv R \\Rightarrow F \\vee S \\Rightarrow F)\\), does not occupy\nany region in space. More exactly, it does not exemplify the property\nof occupying some region in space (though, perhaps it encodes this\nproperty, if being round implies occupying some region in space).\nAnalogously, according to MOT\\(^{dc}\\), the object called\n\u201cthe golden mountain\u201d, i.e.,\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(xF \\equiv G \\Rightarrow F \\vee M \\Rightarrow F)\\), does not\nexemplify the property of being accessible to the senses (at best, it\nencodes this property). Therefore, there is nothing paradoxical in the\nfact that nobody has ever seen a golden mountain and that it is\nimpossible to determine the location of the round square.\n\nFinally, MOT\\(^{dc}\\) does not have the counterintuitive\nconsequence that the only difference between existent and nonexistent\nobjects is that the latter lack the property of being existent, such\nthat if an object goes out of existence, the vast majority of its\nproperties (like being human, loving pancakes, being violent-tempered,\nand so forth) stay exactly the same. Consider again my nonexistent\ngreen-eyed counterpart. According to MOT\\(^{dc}\\), this object\nencodes being human, being female, being a philosopher, and\nso forth, but does not exemplify these properties; therefore,\nit does not belong to the class of female philosophers, not even to\nthe class of humans or to the class of living beings. Thus, it is\nclear that my green-eyed counterpart\u2019s nonexistence is by far\nnot the only difference between it and myself. In general, nonexistent\nobjects are a particular kind of objects, according to\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\)\u2014very different from ordinary existent objects.\nIn what follows, we\u2019ll call them \u201cMeinongian\nobjects\u201d.\n",
