Laing, and\nMichel Foucault. Many of these involved social and political critiques\nand calls to action, with real-world consequences that have been\nlinked to deinstitutionalization, human rights movements, and a shift\ntowards more autonomy-focused mental health care. In English language\ntheorizing Szasz and Laing rejected the appropriateness of analogizing\nparticular \u201cproblems in living\u201d (Szasz) with medical\ndisorders, insisting that misapplication of the medical model to\nmental health was emblematic of the overreach of the medical\nestablishment. The practices and discourses within society and its\ninstitutions making up the era\u2019s episteme are depicted\nhistorically by Foucault, the focus on the exercise of psychiatric\npower that, arising with modern science, is increasingly exerted\nthrough mechanisms of protection, surveillance, and control. With\nmodernity, on this account, power is no longer brute force. Instead,\nit takes a more diffused and subtle form that imperceptibly\ndisciplines and controls not only bodies, but selves (Foucault 1965,\nBracken & Thomas 2010, 2013; Rose 2010; Iliopoulos 2012).\nFoucault\u2019s sweeping ideas remain central to the \u201cpost\npsychiatry\u201d and \u201ccritical psychiatry\u201d that have\nemerged during the beginning of the twenty-first century.\n",
