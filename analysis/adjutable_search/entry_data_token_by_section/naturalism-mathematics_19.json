    "main_text": "Heterogeneous Naturalism || If Mathematics is Methodologically Autonomous, does that establish Maddy's Naturalism?\n5.2 If Mathematics is Methodologically Autonomous, does that establish Maddy's Naturalism?\n\n\nThat a statement-issuing practice is as a matter of fact autonomous\ndoes not entail that its statements are thereby acceptable. Practices\nmay be hermetically sealed from outside influence (e.g., astrology,\ndogmatic theology), but that does not in itself make their claims\nacceptable. What makes mathematics different?\n\n\nMaddy recognises this problem for her position (1997, 203\u20135;\n2005, 449; 2007, 346\u20137), which reviews and discussions of her\nwork have seized upon (e.g., Dieterle 1999, Rosen 1999, Roland 2007;\nonly Tappenden (2001) is more sympathetic). She addresses it by making\na distinction between pure and applied disciplines. Taking astrology as\na foil, she notes that applied astrology may be construed as making\nclaims about the empirical world. Using her ordinary scientific\nstandards, the scientific naturalist appreciates that applied astrology\nis false (as it diverges from the accepted scientific story). Hence\napplied astrology does not deserve the naturalist's respect. Pure\nastrology in contrast is astrology interpreted as treating of\n\u2018certain supernatural vibrations that don't interact\ncausally with ordinary physical phenomena\u2019 (1997, 204).\nHowever, there is no reason to believe in pure astrology, since it does\nnot feature in our best scientific theory of the world. On either\ninterpretation, then, astrology is disanalogous to mathematics.\n\n\nMaddy seems to want to have her cake and eat it. The reason for\nmathematics' credibility is supposed to be its application in\nscience. But why should the fact that mathematics features in our best\nscience be a reason for believing mathematicians'\nutterances\u2014that is, a reason for taking them to be true? The\nsuspicion is that if featuring in best science is the mark of\ncredibility, it should be scientific standards that ultimately\ndetermine mathematical theories' acceptability. Maddy has indeed\ncited a feature distinguishing mathematics from pure astrology, as she\npoints out (2007, 390); but what still remains unclear is why\nthis feature should make mathematics rather than science\nauthoritative with respect to questions in mathematics proper. Thus it\nseems that she has not explained how one can consistently be a\nmathematical naturalist about mathematical theories but a scientific\nnaturalist about everything else, including the truth and nature of\nmathematics. More generally, given that a practice issues in\ntruth-evaluable statements, it seems that one cannot advocate\nX-standards as the arbiters of these statements' acceptability\nwhile simultaneously advocating a different set of standards, the\nY-standards, as arbiters of whether or not the statements should be\ntaken as true, how they should be interpreted, etc. Notice that this is a problem\nfaced exclusively by heterogeneous as opposed to uniform \nnaturalism.\n\n\nThe only way to avoid this apparent inconsistency is to suppose that\nto \u2018accept\u2019 a statement sanctioned by mathematical\npractice\u2014a statement to which the autonomous practice of\nmathematics gives the thumbs-up\u2014does not amount to taking it as\ntrue. Although suggested by a couple of passages in Maddy (1997), this\ninterpretation is not one that can seriously be put on her\nbook. Besides, it is tantamount to scientific naturalism in all but\nname. It amounts to the claim that whatever mathematicians spend their\ntime saying, doing, and publishing should not be interfered with, but\nthat we should be mindful only to believe those mathematical claims\nsanctioned on scientific grounds, whether or not they are given the\nthumbs-up in mathematicians' language-game.\n\n\nThis picture has recently been complicated by Maddy's\nclaims that what she calls Arealism\u2014not taking set theory and\nmore generally mathematics to be true\u2014may be just as\nscientifically respectable as Thin Realism\u2014roughly, the view that\nsets have only the properties ascribed to them by set theory (2007,\nIV.4). This entry does not have space to do justice to this twist in\nMaddy's metaphilosophy. Suffice it to note the following. The issues\njust discussed seem to arise for the Thin Realist just as much as any\nother kind of realist. And the Arealist construal seems to transform\nMaddy's position into something quite different from the\nheterogeneous naturalism under consideration here.\n",
