    "main_text": "The futility of specifying the marks and features of objectification\n7. Conclusion\n\nUndoubtedly, objectification is a concept difficult to define, as\nNussbaum also acknowledges, since it turns out to be\n\u2018slippery\u2019 and \u2018multiple\u2019 (Nussbaum 1995,\n251). How to best to define objectification, if we can define it at\nall, and whether this notion should be restricted to describe the\nmorally objectionable, or expanded to cover benign and/or positive\naspects of the way we see and treat each other in our daily lives is\nan ongoing debate. Much recent feminist work has been devoted to\ncomprehensive philosophical analyses of objectification, which will\nhopefully lead to more complete and coherent understandings of this\nnotion.\n",
