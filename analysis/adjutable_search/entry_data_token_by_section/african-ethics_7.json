    "main_text": "Social, Not Individualistic, Ethics\n8. Social, Not Individualistic, Ethics\n\n\nA humanistic morality, whose central focus is the concern for the\nwelfare and interest of each member of community, would expectably be a\nsocial morality which is enjoined by social life itself. Such\nis the nature of African morality. Social life or sociality is natural\nto the human being because every human being is born into an existing\nhuman society. A traditional Akan thinker asserted in a previously\nquoted proverb that says that \u2018When a human being descends from\nthe heavens, he [or she] descends into a human town [or, a human\nsociety].\u2019 The point of the maxim is that the human being is\nsocial by nature. This view finds a variant in Aristotle's\ncelebrated dictum that \u2018The human being is by nature a\nsocial animal\u2019, that is, that a human being is by nature a\nmember of a\npolis, a human community. [The word politikon used in\nAristotle's dictum means \u2018social\u2019 rather than\n\u2018political\u2019.] Being a member of the human community by\nnature, the individual is naturally related or oriented toward other\npersons and must have relationships with them. The natural sociality or\nrelationality of human beings would\u2014and should\u2014prescribe a\nsocial ethic, rather than the ethic of individualism. Individualistic\nethics that focuses on the welfare and interests of the individual is\nhardly regarded in African moral thought.\n\n\nAfrican social ethic is expressed in many maxims (or, proverbs) that\nemphasize the importance of the values of mutual helpfulness,\ncollective responsibility, cooperation, interdependence, and reciprocal\nobligations. Let me refer to a few of these, from the Akan\nrepertoire:\n\n The well-being of man depends on his fellow man.\n(onipa yieye firi onipa) \n\n\nThe point of this proverb is, not that a person should always look\nto another (or others) for his well-being and the attainment of his\ngoals, but that there are occasions when the demonstration by another\nperson (or other persons) of goodwill, sympathy, compassion, and the\nwillingness to help can be a great boost to a person's attempts\nto achieve his goals, to fulfill his life. The dependency noted in the\nforegoing proverb is to be put down to the limited nature of the\npossibilities of the human individual. Human limitations are in fact\nexpressed in the following Akan proverb:\n\nMan is not a palm-tree that he should be complete\n (or, self sufficient).\n(onipa nye abe na ne ho ahyia ne ho)\n\n\n\nThe proverb points up the inadequacies of the human being that make\nit impossible for him to fulfill his life, socially, economically,\nemotionally, psychologically, and so on. It is evidently true that in\nthe context of the society, in terms of functioning or flourishing in a\nhuman society, the human individual is not sufficient, for her\ncapacities, talents, and dispositions are not adequate for the\nrealization of her potential and basic needs. It is only through\ncooperation with other human beings that the needs and goals of the\nindividual can be fulfilled. With his self-sufficiency whittled away by\nman's natural condition, the individual requires the succor and\nrelationships of others in order to satisfy his basic needs. A social\nethic that recognizes the importance of the values of mutual help,\ngoodwill, and reciprocity is the kind of ethic that will counter the\nlack of human self-sufficiency in respect of talents and capacities and\nin many ways help realize his basic needs.\n\n\nReciprocity and interdependence are forthrightly expressed in the\nfollowing Akan maxims:\n\nThe right arm washes the left arm and the left arm\nwashes the right arm.\n(wo nsa nifa hohorow benkum, na benkum nso hohorow nifa)\n\n\n\nThat the left arm cannot wash itself is of course a matter of\neveryday experience. It is when the two arms wash each other that both\nbecome clean: thus, the need for interdependence.\n\nLife is mutual aid.\n(Obra ye nnoboa)\n\n\n\nThe Akan word nnoboa means \u2018helping each other to\nwork on the farm\u2019. In the farming communities of rural Ghana,\nwhen a farmer realizes that work on the farm cannot be completed within\na certain time if he did it single-handedly, he would request the\nassistance and support of other farmers in the community. The other\nfarmers would readily lend a helping hand to that farmer, who would, in\nthis way, achieve his productivity goals and do so on time. The same\nrequest would, when necessary, be made by the other farmers on\ndifferent occasions. It is this kind of experience that led an Akan\ntraditional thinker to create this proverb which, because of the word\n\u2018life\u2019 (obra), has been made to cover other\nspheres of the human life than the purely economic (or agricultural).\nRefusing to offer help to others and consistently seeking one's\nown good and disregarding the good of others will result in one's\nbeing denied the help and goodwill that may be necessary to achieve\ncertain ends. Since you refused to help someone who needed your help or\nsomeone who was in distress, you are likely to meet the same refusal or\ndenial when you need some help\u2014perhaps more help at that. The\nmorality of a shared life, as in any community, thus demands mutuality\nor reciprocity as a moral mandate in a world in which human beings,\nweak and limited in many ways, are subject to vulnerable\nsituations. Mutual aid, then, becomes a moral obligation.\n\n\nThat a human being, due to her limitations, deserved to be helped is\nexpressed in the following maxim:\n\nA human being needs help.\n(onipa hia moa)\n\n\nThe Akan word translated \u2018needs\u2019 is hia, which,\nas used in this maxim, has a normative  connotation; thus, it\ndoes more than simply expressing a fact about human life or the human\ncondition. The real meaning of the maxim, then, is that a human being\ndeserves, and therefore ought, to be helped. It also means that a human\nbeing must be regarded as an object of moral concern and should\ntherefore be entitled to help by others in the appropriate\ncircumstances. The reason why you should help someone in need is also\ngiven in the following maxim, among others:\n\n\n Your neighbor's situation is [potentially] your situation.\n(Wo yonko da ne wo da)\n\n\nTwo important things about this maxim need to be pointed out. One is\nthat the maxim is uttered in references only to the pitiable, miserable\nor unfortunate situation of another person (referred to in the maxim as\n\u201cyour neighbor\u201d\u2014wo yonko) or other people\n(your \u201cneighbors\u201d). These unfortunate situations or\ncircumstances insistently call for the demonstration of sympathy,\ncompassion, and willingness to offer some help. The other important\nthing about this maxim is that the word \u2018neighbor\u2019 in the\nmaxim does not necessarily refer to the person next door or in\none's community but to any other person in your\ncommunity and beyond: even in far-off places.\n\n\nThe basic or ultimate thrust of the maxim is that you should not\nshow insensitivity to people who are in pitiable situations, for one\nday you might be in that situation too and would need the help\nof others: thus, your neighbor's situation is potentially your\nsituation; every other person is basically you. Social morality thus\ndemands mutual reciprocity as a moral mandate in a world in which human\nbeings can easily be overcome\u2014even overwhelmed\u2014by the\ncontingencies of the human condition and existence. Altruism is, thus,\na fundamental moral value.\n\n\nInsensitivity to the needs and hardships or suffering situations of\nothers is repudiated in Akan morality, as it is, indeed, repudiated in\nthe moralities of all human cultures. In Akan moral thought and\npractice, a maxim that rebukes the lack of feeling for others is put\nthus:\n\nWhen it sticks into your neighbor's flesh,\nit is as if it stuck into a piece of wood.\n(etua wo yonko ho a, etua dua mu)\n\n\n\n\u201cSticking into your neighbor's flesh (or, body)\u201d is\nanother way of referring to the suffering, misfortune, hardship, or\npain of another person. When something, such as a needle, sticks into\nyour own flesh or body, you feel the pain. If it stuck into another\nperson's\u2014your neighbor's\u2014flesh, you would not directly\nfeel the pain. Even so, you should not feel insensitive to the pain or\nsuffering of that person and shrug off your moral shoulders, for the\nother person's body is certainly not a piece of wood that\ncannot feel pain.\n\n\nThe foregoing maxims and many others similar to them in content and\npurpose all underline a social morality. There are many African\nfolktales whose conclusions are intended to affirm the values of social\nmorality\u2014the kind of morality that is centered on human\nrelations. The social character of morality requires that the\nindividual member of the society, ever mindful of his interests, adjust\nthose interests to the interests and needs of others. This requires him\nto give due consideration to the interests and welfare of others.\nNecessarily embedded in a human community, the individual person has a\ndual moral responsibility: for him or herself as an individual\nand for others as co-members of the community with whom she shares\ncertain basic needs and interests.\n",
