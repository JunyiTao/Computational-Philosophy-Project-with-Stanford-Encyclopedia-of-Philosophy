    "main_text": "Contradiction and Conversion || Conversion of Hypothetical Propositions\n4.4 Conversion of Hypothetical Propositions\n\nThe conversion of hypothetical propositions is explicitly discussed\nonly in a short chapter of the Qiy\u0101s (VII.3), where\nAvicenna briefly talks about the status of (e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)) propositions\n(conversion does not apply in a genuine sense to disjunctions, whose parts are equivalent: \u201cAlways, either every A is B or C is\nD\u201d is the same statement as \u201cAlways, either every C is D\nor every A is B\u201d). This, however, should not suggest that\nconversion is less important in the case of hypotheticals than it is\nin the case of categoricals: it is in fact an essential method of proof for\ncertain hypothetical syllogisms. Additional rules may be extrapolated from the\nextensive discussions of syllogisms involving conditionals in\nQiy\u0101s VI.1, VI.2, and VI.4.\n\nIn the conversion of conditional propositions, the parameters that matter are the\nquantity of the proposition to be converted and that of its\nconverse, and the type of conditional (luz\u016bm\u012b or\nittif\u0101q\u012b), while the antecedent and the consequent are\ntreated in a way analogous to the way in which terms are treated in\nthe conversion of categoricals. The following are notable as well as\nfrequently used conversion principles: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(\\eC^{i})pq & \u22a2 (\\eC^{i})qp & (\\textit{Qiy\u0101s}, \\textrm{ VII.3}) \\\\\n(\\aC)pq & \u22a2 (\\iC)qp\\\\\n(\\iC)pq & \u22a2 (\\iC)qp \n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n",
