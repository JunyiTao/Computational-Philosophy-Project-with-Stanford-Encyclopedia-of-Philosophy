Cartesian Cosmology and Astrophysics\n\nDescartes\u2019 vortex theory of planetary motion proved initially to\nbe one of the most influential aspects of Cartesian physics, at least\nuntil roughly the mid-eighteenth century. A vortex, for Descartes, is\na large circling band of material particles. In essence,\nDescartes\u2019 vortex theory attempts to explain celestial\nphenomena, especially the orbits of the planets or the motions of\ncomets, by situating them (usually at rest) in these large circling\nbands. The entire Cartesian plenum, consequently, is comprised of a\nnetwork or series of separate, interlocking vortices. In our solar\nsystem, for example, the matter within the vortex has formed itself\ninto a set of stratified bands, each lodging a planet, that circle the\nsun at varying speeds. The minute material particles that form the\nvortex bands consist of either the atom-sized, globules (secondary\nmatter) or the \u201cindefinitely\u201d small debris (primary\nmatter) left over from the impact and fracture of the larger elements;\ntertiary matter, in contrast, comprises the large, macroscopic\nmaterial element (Pr III 48\u201354). This three-part division of\nmatter, along with the three laws of nature, are responsible for all\ncosmological phenomena in Descartes\u2019 system, including gravity.\nAs described in Pr III 140, a planet or comet comes to rest in a\nvortex band when its radially-directed, outward tendency to flee the\ncenter of rotation (i.e., centrifugal force; see\n Section 6)\n is balanced by an equal tendency in the minute elements that comprise\nthe vortex ring. If the planet has either a greater or lesser\ncentrifugal tendency than the small elements in a particular vortex,\nthen it will, respectively, either ascend to the next highest vortex\n(and possibly reach equilibrium with the particles in that band) or be\npushed down to the next lowest vortex\u2014and this latter scenario\nultimately supplies Descartes\u2019 explanation of the phenomenon of\ngravity, or \u201cheaviness\u201d. More specifically, Descartes\nholds that the minute particles that surround the earth account for\nterrestrial gravity in this same manner (Pr IV 21\u201327). As for\nthe creation of the vortex system, Descartes reasons that the\nconserved quantity of motion imparted to the plenum eventually\nresulted in the present vortex configuration (Pr III 46). God first\npartitioned the plenum into equal-sized portions, and then placed\nthese bodies into various circular motions that, ultimately, formed\nthe three elements of matter and the vortex systems (see Figure\n3).\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Plenum vortices in the\nPrinciples, Pr III 53.\n\n\nBesides the ontological economy of only requiring inertial motion and\nits attendant force effects, Descartes\u2019 choice of circularly\nmoving bands of particles may have also been motivated by worries\nover, for lack of a better term, \u201cplenum crowding\u201d. In the\nPrinciples, he argues: \u201cIt has been shown\u2026that\nall places are full of bodies\u2026. From this it follows that no\nbody can move except in a complete circle of matter or ring of bodies\nwhich all move at the same time\u201d (Pr II 33). Circular motion is\ntherefore necessary for Descartes because there are no empty spaces\nfor a moving object to occupy. Although the world is described as\n\u201cindefinitely\u201d large (Pr I 26\u201327, with only God\nreceiving the more positive description, infinite), the non-circular\nmotion of a single body could violate the Cartesian conservation\nprinciple by resulting in an indeterminate material displacement. As\nan aside, it is enormously difficult to reconcile Descartes\u2019\ncollision rules with his claim that all bodily motion occurs in\ncircular paths; moreover, since the bodies that comprise the circular\npath all move simultaneously, it seems to follow from the definition\nof \u201cbody\u201d (see\n Section 3)\n that there is only one moving body (and not many).\n\nReturning to the vortex theory, Descartes allots a considerable\nportion of the Principles to explicating various celestial\nphenomena, all the while adopting and adapting numerous sub-hypotheses\nthat apply his overall mechanical system to specific celestial events.\nOne of the more famous of these explanations is the Cartesian theory\nof vortex collapse, which also provides an hypothesis on the origins\nof comets (Pr III 115\u2013120). Briefly, Descartes reckons that a\nsignificant amount of first element matter constantly flows between\nadjacent vortices: as the matter travels out of the equator of one\nvortex, it passes into the poles of its neighbor. Under normal\nconditions, primary matter flows from the poles of a vortex into its\ncenter, i.e., the sun, which is itself comprised of primary matter.\nDue to centrifugal force, these particles press out against the\nsurrounding secondary globules as they begin their advance towards the\nequator (Pr III 120\u2013121); the pressure exerted by the primary\nand secondary elements (on a person\u2019s optic nerve) also serving\nas the cause of light (Pr III 55\u201364, IV 195). Since the adjacent\nvortices also possess the same tendency to swell in size, a balance of\nexpansion forces prevents the encroachment of neighboring vortices. On\noccasion, however, a buildup of larger elements on the sun\u2019s\nsurface, identified as sunspots, may conspire to prevent the incoming\nflow of first element matter from the poles. If the sunspots\nultimately cover the entire surface of the sun, the vortex\u2019s\nremaining primary matter will be expelled at the equator, and thus it\nno longer has a source of outward pressure to prevent the encroachment\nof neighboring vortices. Once the vortex is engulfed by its expanding\nneighbors, the encrusted sun may become either a planet in a new\nvortex, or end up as a comet passing through many vortices.\n\nOn the whole, the vortex theory offered the natural philosopher a\nhighly intuitive model of celestial phenomena that was compatible with\nthe mechanical philosophy. The theory was regarded as superior to\nNewton\u2019s theory of universal gravitation since it did not posit\na mysterious, occult quality (gravity) as the cause of the planetary\norbits or the free-fall of terrestrial objects. The vortex theory\nlikewise provided a built-in explanation for the common direction of\nall planetary orbits. Additionally, the vortex theory allowed\nDescartes to endorse a form of Copernicanism (i.e., sun-centered\nworld) without running afoul of Church censorship. Since the alleged\nmotion of the earth was one of the Church\u2019s principal objections\nto Galileo\u2019s science, Descartes hoped to avoid this objection by\nplacing the earth at rest within a vortex band that circled the sun,\nsuch that the earth does not undergo a change of place relative to the\ncontaining surface of the neighboring material particles in its vortex\nband (Pr III 24\u201331; and section 3). Through this ingenious\nmaneuver, Descartes could then claim that the earth does not\nmove\u2014via his definition of place and motion\u2014and yet\nmaintain the Copernican hypothesis that the earth orbits the sun.\n\u201cThe Earth, properly speaking, is not moved, nor are any of the\nPlanets; although they are carried along by the heaven\u201d (Pr III\n28). In the long run, however, Descartes\u2019 vortex theory failed\nfor two fundamental reasons: first, neither Descartes nor his\nfollowers ever developed a systematic mathematical treatment of the\nvortex theory that could match the accuracy and predictive scope of\nthe (continuously improving) Newtonian theory; and second, many\nattempts by Cartesian natural philosophers to test Descartes\u2019\nvarious ideas on the dynamics of circularly moving particles (e.g., by\nusing large spinning barrels filled with small particles) did not meet\nthe predictions advanced in the Principles (see Aiton\n1972).\n",
