    "main_text": "Critical Reactions\n4. Wider Cultural Relevance\n\nDewey was ahead of his time in his devotion to multiculturalism. The\nselection of illustrations Dewey chose for Art as Experience\nincluded Pueblo Indian pottery, Bushmen rock-painting, Scythian\nornament, and African sculpture, as well as works by El Greco, Renoir,\nCezanne and Matisse. He was interested in traditional and folk arts in\nMexico, admiring the designs of the rural schools over those of the\ncities (1926). He was also associated, mainly through Barnes, with\nAfrican-American culture. Barnes was invited to write a chapter for\nThe New Negro edited by Alain Locke (Locke 1925). The New\nNegro was one of the founding documents of the Harlem\nRenaissance. The students in Dewey\u2019s and Barnes\u2019 first\nexperimental classes in art education were mainly from the black\nworking class. Barnes collected African-American art and also\nencouraged African-American students to study at the Barnes\nFoundation. African-American painter and illustrator Aaron Douglas,\nwho came to the foundation in 1927, studied in Paris in 1931 under a\nFoundation fellowship (Jubilee 1982). Barnes also had a long\nassociation with Lincoln University, a historically black college,\nmany students of which studied at the Barnes Foundation (Hollingsworth\n1994). Dewey was one of the founding members of the NAACP (National\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People) and one of the\nsixty signatories to the 1909 \u201cCall\u201d for a National\nConference to Address Racial Inequality, a founding document for the\nNAACP (Library of Congress\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nDewey also sought to promote cross-cultural understanding through his\nfounding of the China Institute in New York City in 1926. The China\nInstitute, which continues today, advertises itself as the only\ninstitution in that city to focus solely on Chinese civilization, art\nand culture. Hu Shih, a student of Dewey\u2019s at Columbia and one\nof the leading figures in the creation of the Institute, invited him\nto Peking in 1919 (Yong Ho 2004\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nAlthough Dewey was widely versed in literature, architecture,\npainting, sculpture, and the theater, he was relatively uneducated in\nmusic, and he was said to be tone-deaf. Yet he often had insightful\nthings to say about music, and many musicians and music educators have\ndrawn inspiration from his theory (e.g., Zeltner 1975). Unfortunately,\nhe did not discuss photography or film as separate art forms.\n\nMany writers complain that Dewey showed little interest in the\navant-garde art of his time (for example, Eldridge 2010). It is true\nthat Cubism, Dadaism and Surrealism play no role in his writing, and\nhis theory seems to actually preclude Non-objective painting (Jacobson\n1960), although he does speak positively of abstract art. Nor did he\nrefer much to such innovative poets as T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound.\nAlthough this may indicate a conservative approach to the arts, he\nnonetheless had considerable influence on various innovative art\nmovements both in his own time and later. Perhaps most significantly,\nthe director of the Federal Art Project from 1935\u20131943, Holger\nCahill, was a Dewey follower (Mavigliano 1984). Amongst painters,\nThomas Hart Benton, the regionalist realist, was an early convert to\nhis philosophy. Dewey was also on the board of the influential Black\nMountain College, which had students such as Merce Cunningham and John\nCage. Josef Albers, an important painting teacher there, was first\ninfluenced by Dewey\u2019s educational theory and later by his\naesthetics (Gosse 2012).\n\nIn Mexico, Escuelas de Pintura al Aire Libre, or open-air painting\nschools, began during the Mexican Revolution and achieved an\nestablished structure under the government of Alvaro Obregon\n(1920\u201324). They were promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinez, who was\ninspired by Dewey.\n\n\nTurning to late twentieth century artists, Dewey\u2019s influence on\nAbstract Expressionism was especially strong (Buettner 1975, Berube\n1998). For example, Robert Motherwell, who studied Art as\nExperience when he was a philosophy major at Stanford, considered\nit to be one of his bibles (Berube 1998). Donald Judd, the Minimalist\nsculptor, read and admired Dewey (Raskin 2010). Earth Art, with its\nemphasis on getting art out of the museum, might even be seen as\napplied Dewey. There is also reason to believe that Allan Kaprow, one\nof the originators of Happenings and Performance Art, read Dewey and\ndrew on his ideas (Kelley 2003). Although one author has argued that\ncontemporary Body Art has moved away from the integrated consummated\naesthetic experience Dewey commends (Jay 2002), another argues that\nDewey anticipates this movement (Brodsky 2002).\n",
