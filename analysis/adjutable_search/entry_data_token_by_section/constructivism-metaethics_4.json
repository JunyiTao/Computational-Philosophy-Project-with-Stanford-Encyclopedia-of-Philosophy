    "main_text": "Varieties of Kantian Constructivism || Constructivism for Finite Rational Agents\n2.3 Constructivism for Finite Rational Agents\n\nOnora O\u2019Neill defines metaethical constructivism as a third\nalternative between realism and subjectivism (O\u2019Neill 1989b:\n279). She departs from the versions of Kantian constructivism\ndiscussed above because she makes no appeal to transcendental\narguments and rejects the idealized conceptions of rational agency\nthat are at play in other versions of Kantian constructivism. In her\nview, \u201cfinite rational beings\u201d should not be construed as\n\u201cbeings whose rationality is finite\u201d, but as \u201cfinite\nbeings who are rational\u201d. Finitude does not entail any\nlimitation on strategic reasoning, even though there is no way to\nestablish that finite rational agents have access to all sorts of\nreasoning that infinite or disembodied rational agents may have. The\nkey thesis is that instrumental principles are not the only principles\nof rationality, and more importantly, they never operate in isolation\n(O\u2019Neill 1989b: 74).\n\nAccording to O\u2019Neill, this more austere constructivism is closer\nto Kant\u2019s own theory than other varieties (O\u2019Neill 1989a;\nO\u2019Neill 2015). In her view, Kant\u2019s constructivism is\nmotivated by the vivid awareness of interdependency, finitude, and\nmutual vulnerability. Humans are prone to mistakenly rely on claims\nthat are not warranted, and thus they need to check and criticize the\nunjustified and arbitrary assumptions they make in reasoning\n(O\u2019Neill 1989b). O\u2019Neill shares Kant\u2019s claim that\n\n\n\nreasoning is fundamentally practical: it aims to provide\nstandards or norms that thought, action and\ncommunication can (but often fail) to meet. (O\u2019Neill 2015: 2)\n\n\n\nSecond, she shares Kant\u2019s claim that reasoning is necessary\nbecause humans are finite and interdependent beings. Third, she agrees\nwith Kant that the principles of reason are not revealed to us by\nintuition or introspection: We must use our rational powers to figure\nout what these principles are. Finally, she adopts Kant\u2019s claim\nthat to fulfill its distinctive function, norms of reasoning must be\nuniversal. The differences between Kant\u2019s and\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s views concern the justification of the claim\nabout universality. According to O\u2019Neill, universality is a\nrequirement of reasoning because reasoning is to be used by a\nplurality of finite, inter-dependent agents whose action and\ncommunication are not antecedently coordinated (e.g., by instinct,\ndivine providence, or law).\n\nThe requirement of universality or followability sets minimal\nconstraints on processes that count as reasoning (O\u2019Neill 2015:\n3). By following this reasoning, we find out that no plurality of\nagents can choose to live by principles that aim to destroy or\nundermine the agency (of whatever determinate shape) of some of its\nmembers (O\u2019Neill 1989a: 10; see also O\u2019Neill 1989b, 2015).\nAs a result, practical reasoning justifies the prohibition to harm,\ncoerce, and deceive others. This is not to say that by appealing to\nthe requirement of followability we can solve all problems and fully\ndetermine the content of all duties. On the contrary, O\u2019Neill\nthinks that there are large varieties of moral issues for which we\nneed to offer more substantive arguments. However, her account\npromises to vindicate reason\u2019s ability (and right) to\ndistinguish sound justifications from mere rationalizations.\n\nO\u2019Neill agrees with Kant that only reason itself can verify the\ncredentials of its own claims. The process of figuring out what the\nprinciples of reason are is avowedly circular. This\ncircularity is not worrisome because the process of verification is\nreflexive, as it involves reason critiquing the claims of reason\nitself. More specifically, the critique of reason uncovers a basic\nprinciple of reasoning: we should rely only on those principles that\nother rational agents can share. The authority of reason is thus\nconferred by public communication among free, rational agents, and\nconsists in the fact that the principles that govern our thoughts are\nneither self-serving nor self-defeating. We find out what these\nprinciples say by submitting our claims to free and critical debates,\nwhich constitute \u201cthe public use of reason\u201d (O\u2019Neill\n1989b: 70\u201371, 206).\n\nSince the critique of reason is a continuous, progressive, and\nreflexive process, reason exhibits a history, which coincides with the\ndevelopment of practices of tolerance and mutual recognition\n(O\u2019Neill 1999: 174, 2002). Such practices establish the\nauthority of reason. This \u2018developmental\u2019 view of\npractical reason and of its autonomy accounts for change and progress.\nArguably, this is a significant explanatory advantage over competing\nviews, which do not fully appreciate the historical and dialectical\ndimension of truth and reason (O\u2019Neill 1989b: 70\u201371;\nArruda 2016). As we shall see in\n section 6,\n it requires the constructivist to provide an account of truth and\nobjective knowledge as altering in time.\n\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s defense of the virtuous circularity of\nconstructivism identifies a solution to a problem that affects\nconstructivism in general, which we shall consider in\n section 7.\n",
