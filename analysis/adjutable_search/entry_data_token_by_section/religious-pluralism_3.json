Religious Diversity and Justified Belief\n\nSome philosophers/theologians assume that belief assessment, when\nconducted properly, can often resolve epistemic peer conflict (Byrne\n2011, 31; Aijaz 2017). But what if we assume that while the\nconsideration of criteria such as self-consistency and\ncomprehensiveness can rule out certain options, there exists no set of\ncriteria that will allow us to resolve most religious epistemic\ndisputes (either between or within religious perspectives) in a\nneutral, nonquestion-begging fashion (Peterson et al. 2013,\n69\u201374)? In what epistemic position does this then place the\nexclusivist? Or to use the phrasing preferred in the current\n\u201cepistemology of disagreement\u201d debates, to what extent, if\nany, is it reasonable for exclusivists to retain their exclusivistic\nbeliefs when it is acknowledged that epistemic peers\n disagree?[4]\n\nThe answer, as some see it, is that exclusivists can no longer\njustifiably maintain that their exclusivistic beliefs are true. J.L.\nSchellenberg, for example, argues that because no more than one among\na set of incompatible truth claims can be true, disputants in a debate\nover such claims are justified in continuing to maintain that their\nclaim is true only if they possess nonquestion-begging justification\n\u2014 justification based on assumptions and lines of reasoning\nacceptable to both parties \u2014 for believing the incompatible\nclaim of any competitor to be false. However, since disputants in no\nreligious conflicts possess such justification, disputants cannot be\njustified \u201cin holding their own claim to be true.\u201d Or, As\nSchellenberg states this conclusion in another context, we must\nconclude that in the absence of objective, nonquestion-begging\njustification, none of the disputants in religious conflicts \u201chas\njustification for supposing the others\u2019 claims false\u201d\n(Schellenberg 2000, 213). David Silver comes to a similar conclusion:\n\u201c[Exclusivists] should provide independent evidence for the claim\nthat they have a special source of religious knowledge ... or they\nshould relinquish their exclusivist religious beliefs\u201d (Silver 2001,\n11).\n\nIn more recent discussions, this perspective is sometimes labeled\n\u201c(strong) Conciliationism\u201d (Christensen 2007, 2016; Feldman\n2006) or the \u201cEqual Weight View\u201d (Cohen 2013). When exclusivists\nand their epistemic peers disagree and exclusivists can offer no\nindependent reasons that establish their position, then exclusivists\nshould acknowledge that their perspective has no greater epistemic\nweight than those of their epistemic competitors and either suspend\njudgment or abandon their exclusivistic position and grant equal\nepistemic status to all the self-consistent, comprehensive\nperspectives in play.\n\nOthers have not gone this far, arguing rather that while exclusivists\nneed not abandon religious belief in the face of unresolved conflict,\nthey must, or at least be willing to, hold their exclusive religious\nbeliefs more tentatively (with less confidence). Philip Quinn argues,\nfor instance, that acknowledged epistemic parity necessarily has a\nnegative (epistemically humbling) impact on the level of justification\nfor any religious belief system. Such parity does not necessarily\nreduce justification below a level sufficient for rational\nacceptability. But for those proponents of a religion who are\n\u201csufficiently aware of religious diversity, the justification that\nthe [religion] receives from its sources is a good deal less than\nwould be the case were there no such diversity\u201d (Quinn 2005a, 137).\nJames Kraft agrees, arguing that when individuals acknowledge that\nthose with whom they disagree are equivalently informed and capable\nand have made no obvious mistakes in reasoning, their confidence in\ntheir perspective is rightly reduced (Kraft 2007)\n\nThe tentativeness this reduction in confidence produces, McKim tells\nus, does not entail never-ending inquiry. What it means, rather, is\nthat in the face of unresolved religious diversity, a person should be\nopen to the possibility \u201cthat one or more of the [alternatives]\nmay be correct \u2026 that the position one had thought to be\ncorrect may be wrong [while] one of the other positions may be\nright\u201d (McKim 2001, 154\u201355). Joseph Runzo and Gary Gutting\nagree. According to Runzo, \u201call faith commitments must be held\nwith the humbling recognition that they can be misguided, for our\nknowledge is never sure\u201d (Runzo 1993, 236). Gutting argues that\nonly interim, not decisive assent is justified in the face of\nunresolved diversity and that \u201cthose who give merely interim\nassent must recognize the equal value, as an essential element in the\ncontinuing discussion, of beliefs contrary to theirs\u201d (Gutting\n1982, 108). Moreover, argues McKim, such tentativeness in the face of\ndiversity has an important payoff. It can lead to deep tolerance: the\nallowance \u201cthat those with whom you disagree are people whom it\nis worthwhile to approach with rational arguments\u201d (McKim 2001,\n178) And personal tolerance of this sort, we are told, may well lead\nto a more tolerant and open society that will permit and even\nencourage a diversity of opinion on all issues, including opinions on\nreligious matters. [Whether this is in fact the case will be\nconsidered in detail in Section 6.]\n\nWilliam Alston represents an even more charitable response to\nexclusivism. His perspective is based on what he sees as a crucial\ndistinction between two types of epistemic disputes: those in which\n\u201cit is clear what would constitute non-circular grounds for\nsupposing one of the contestants to be superior to the others\u201d\nand those in which it is not. In the former case\u2014in those cases\nin which there is a commonly accepted \u201cprocedure for settling\ndisputes\u201d\u2014it isn\u2019t clear, he acknowledges, that it\nis rational for individuals to continue to maintain that their\nposition is superior (Alston 1988, 442\u2013443).\n\nHowever, as Alston sees it, there exists no such common ground for\nsettling basic epistemic disputes over religious truth claims, and\nthis, he contends, alters the situation drastically. It still remains\ntrue, he grants, that the reality of religious diversity diminishes\njustification. But the fact that \u201cwe are at a loss to specify\n[common ground]\u201d means, he argues, that with respect to those\nreligious perspectives that are self-consistent, it is not\n\u201cirrational for one to remain an exclusivist\u201d\u2014not\nirrational for proponents of any religious perspective to continue to\nhold that their perspective is true. That is, as Alston sees it, given\nthe absence of common ground for resolving disputes, the proponent of\nany self-consistent religious perspective can justifiably continue to\nbelieve this perspective to be true \u201cdespite not being able to\nshow that it is epistemically superior to the competition\u201d\n(Alston 1988, 443\u2013446). Stated differently yet, Alston grants\nthat objective evidence is necessary for justified belief when the\ndebated issue is one for which such evidence is available. But when\nobjective evidence is not available\u2014as is the case for most\nimportant religious contentions\u2014it cannot be required for\njustified belief.\n\nIn fact, at one point he goes even further. Because there exists at\npresent no neutral ground for adjudicating religious epistemic\nconflicts, it is not only the case, Alston argues, that exclusivists\nare justified (rational) in continuing to consider their own\nperspective superior. Since we do not even know in most cases what a\nnon-circular reason for demonstrating superiority would look like, the\n\u201conly rational course\u201d for exclusivists \u201cis to sit\ntight\u201d with the beliefs \u201cwhich [have] served so well in\nguiding [their] activity in the world.\u201d Or, to generalize this\npoint, Alston speaks for those who maintain that, given the absence of\ncommon ground for adjudicating disputes concerning self-consistent\nreligious perspectives, it is not rational for exclusivists to stop\nmaintaining that their system is superior (Alston 1988,\n 444).[5]\n\nPhilip Quinn represents yet another, increasingly popular approach.\nWhile he agrees with Alston that in the face of diversity exclusivists\nmay well be justified in continuing to \u201csit\ntight\u201d\u2014in continuing to maintain that their religious\nperspective is true\u2014he denies that this is the only rational\ncourse of action available (Quinn 2000, 235\u2013246). The basis for\nthis position is his distinction between a pre-Kantian and a Kantian\nunderstanding of religious belief. To have a pre-Kantian understanding\nof religious belief is to assume that we have (or at least can have)\naccess to the truth as it really is. It is to believe, for instance,\nthat we do (or at least can in principle) know what God is really\nlike. To have a Kantian understanding of religious belief is to assume\nthat although there is a literal noumenal reality, our understanding\nof this reality (and thus our truth claims about this reality) will of\nnecessity be relative to the cultural/social/psychological lenses\nthrough which our conceptualization of this noumenal reality is\nprocessed. It is to believe, for instance, that although there is a\ndivine reality about which we can make truth claims, our understanding\nof (and thus our truth claims about) this divine reality will\nnecessarily to some extent be conditioned by the ways in which our\nenvironment (our culture in the broadest sense) has shaped our\ncategories of thought (Quinn 2000, 241\u2013242).\n\nAlston, Quinn contends, is essentially working off of a pre-Kantian\nmodel of religious belief when he encourages religious exclusivists to\nsit tight in the face of peer conflict since, in the absence of any\nobjective basis for determining which perspective is right, the\nexclusivist has no sufficient reason not to do so. Quinn does not deny\nthat this pre-Kantian approach is justifiable and thus does not deny\nthat someone who follows Alston\u2019s advice to sit tight is\nrational in doing so. However, Quinn believes that \u201cit should\nnot be taken for granted that any of the [contending perspectives] in\nits present form is correct.\u201d Hence, he believes it is equally\njustifiable for an exclusivist to adopt a Kantian approach to\nreligious belief. Specifically, he believes it is equally justifiable\nfor an exclusivist to assume that whatever any of us can know about\nthe truth of the matter will never be a description of religious\nreality that is free of significant cultural/social/psychological\nconditioning. Accordingly, it is also rational, he maintains, for\nexclusivists encountering diverse truth claims to \u201cseek a more\ninclusivist or pluralistic understanding of their own faith\u201d by\nmodifying their beliefs to bring them \u201cinto line with such an\nunderstanding\u201d (Quinn 2000, 242).\n\nIn short, as Quinn sees it, those who hold a position such as\nAlston\u2019s have left us, at least implicitly, with a false\ndilemma: either we find common ground on which we can objectively\ndetermine which religious perspective is the truth or we sit tight\nwith what we have. However, Quinn holds that, once we realize it is\nperfectly reasonable for a person to assume that the proponent of no\nreligious perspective has (or even could have) an accurate\nunderstanding of divine reality as it really is, another rational\nalternative appears. We then see that it is also perfectly rational\nfor people to begin to revise their own phenomenological perspective\non the truth in a way that will allow for greater overlap with the\nphenomenological perspectives of others.\n\nThe approach to conflicting religious perspectives Quinn outlines has\nin fact become increasingly popular in exclusivistic circles.\nConsider, for example, the ongoing debate among Christians over how\nGod brought the rest of reality into existence. Some still claim the\nBible clearly teaches that God created the \u201cheavens and the\nearth\u201d in six twenty-four hour periods about ten thousand years\nago. Others still maintain that the fact that \u201ca day is to the\nLord as a thousand years\u201d (Psalms 90:4) means that while God is\ndirectly responsible for what the Bible says was created each\n\u201cday,\u201d it is most reasonable to believe that the time\nframe for each instance of creative activity could well have been\nmillions, or even billions, of years. And then there are those who\nstill hold that God\u2019s direct creative activity consisted\nprimarily of orchestrating the \u201cBig Bang.\u201d However, more\nrecently, many Christians have taken a more Kantian approach. Based on\ntheir assumption that we may well not have access, even through\nScripture, to exactly how God was involved in the creative process,\nthey have modified what is to be considered essential to Christianity\non this issue. Rather than affirming any of the specific explanations\nof how God created all else, they affirm a more general contention\ncompatible with each of these specific explanations: that God is in\nsome manner directly responsible for the existence of all else. They\nhave, in Quinn\u2019s terms, thinned their core theologies in a way\nthat reconciles the divergent perspectives. [We will see in sections\nbelow that this emphasis on working toward common belief is sometimes\ncited as a way to minimize differing perspectives on the eternal\ndestiny of humans (Section 7) and to approach diversity of thought on\ncontroversial issues in education (Section 8).]\n\nEveryone realizes, though, that moving toward a thinner theology can\nresolve the epistemic tension produced by religious diversity only to\na certain extent. Let\u2019s assume that it is perfectly reasonable, and\npossibly even preferable, for exclusivists to thin their theologies in\nan attempt to minimize that core of truths that must be accepted to\nremain proponents of the specific theological perspectives in\nquestion, to be an exclusivist\u2014even a strongly Kantian\nexclusivist\u2014is still to believe that one\u2019s religious\nperspectives on some religious beliefs are superior in the sense that\nthey are in some important way closer to the truth than are the\ncompeting perspectives of others. Accordingly, while thinning their\ntheology may be a rational choice that can minimize conflict for\nexclusivists, no one is arguing that a certain amount of epistemic\nconflict will not remain.\n\nFinally, we find at the far end of the spectrum those who deny that\nacknowledged peer conflict does in fact require exclusivists to\nabandon their exclusivism or even reduce confidence in their\nexclusivistic perspectives. The key to this position is a distinction\nbetween personal (private) evidence and public evidence (evidence\navailable to all persons involved in the dispute). It is granted that\nindividuals will often find themselves in epistemic disputes with\npersons who are epistemic peers in the sense that they are (1) equally\nintelligent, thoughtful, and free from obvious bias and (2) equally\nfamiliar with all the relevant public evidence. But it is normally\nacknowledged that the final judgments made by participants in such\ndisputes are not made solely on this public evidence. Such judgments\nare based also on personal beliefs to which only each participant has\naccess. Jennifer Lackey notes, for instance, that individuals in an\nepistemic dispute have greater access to the reliability of their own\nbelief-forming faculties than do their epistemic competitors (Lackey\n2010). Ernest Sosa talks of a gulf between the private and public\ndomains (Sosa 2010). Peter van Inwagen speaks of \u201cincommunicable\ninsight that the others, for all their merits, lack\u201d (van Inwagen\n1996). And the weight of this private evidence, it is argued, can make\nit reasonable for individuals to retain their beliefs (including\nexclusivistic religious beliefs) with the same level of confidence,\neven in the face of acknowledged peer disagreement in the public\nsense.\n\nSome critics, of course, will maintain that this is primarily a verbal\nvictory. The question, remember, is whether exclusivists who\nacknowledges that epistemic peers hold incompatible perspectives can\ncontinue to justifiably maintain with full confidence that their\nperspective is superior. And it will seem to some that to claim that\nparticipants in epistemic disputes have access to relevant personal\nevidence not available to their epistemic competitors is in fact\nsimply to acknowledge that the dispute is really not among true\nepistemic peers in the sense originally intended\u2014that is, in the\nsense that all parties are assessing the same body of evidence.\n",
