    "main_text": "Decision Theory: Is It Rational to Choose Transformative Experiences? || Self Uncertainty\n4.3 Self Uncertainty\n\nFinally, the personally transformative aspect of transformative\nexperiences creates the possibility of future selves who are so\ndifferent from their pre-transformed selves that neither the earlier\nnor later selves regards the other as being \u201cthe same\u201d\nperson. As Ullmann-Margalit (2006, 158) puts it, \u201cbig\u201d\ndecisions are \u201ccore-affecting\u201d and \u201ctransform one\u2019s\nfuture self in a significant way\u201d such that one emerges from the\nsituation a different person. As we saw in\n \u00a73,\n spelling out the exact sense of in which one can become a different\nperson is tricky. However, examples illustrate how one might regard a\ntemporally related self as a different person, and shed light on the\nexact nature of the problem for standard decision-making\nprocedures.\n\nParfit (1984, 326) tells the story of a young Russian who holds his\nsocialist ideals close to his heart. The young Russian also happens\ndescend from the aristocracy, and stands to inherit a fortune when his\nrelatives die. He realizes that when this happens, he may lose his\nsocialist ideals. His instructions to his wife\u2014\u201cif I lose\nthese ideals, I want you to think that I cease to\nexist\u201d\u2014reveals that he regards that potential future self\nas a different person. This type of example reinforces Paul\u2019s\n(2017) claim that we cannot first-personally project into futures that\nare too distant or different. Agents who fully appreciate the\npersonally transformative element of transformative experiences\nrealize that these experiences may potentially transform them into\nsomeone different. Thus, from the perspective of the agent deciding\nwhether to undergo a transformative experience, they must treat\noutcomes involving transformation as ones in which they may no longer\nexist.\n\nThe possibility of non-existence (or something regarded as equivalent\nto non-existence) means that even if an agent knows all the fact about\nvalue and future preferences, they cannot use standard decision-making\nprocedures in a straightforward way\u2014at least not if\nthey\u2019re self-interested. After all, even if a future transformed\nself would be incredibly happy and live a good, meaningful life, that\ndoesn\u2019t help the agent contemplating transformation if that\nfuture transformed self is not them in the relevant sense. Chan (2019)\nmakes exactly this point in the context of Pascal\u2019s Wager. The\ninfinite happiness of the believer doesn\u2019t benefit the\nnon-believer precisely because becoming transformed by faith would\nchange them into a different person (which in turn undermines the\nWager\u2019s appeal to self-interest). This point is closely related\nto the challenge raised by Paul for Pettigrew\u2019s view in the\nprevious subsection\n (\u00a74.2).\n The future self is alien, and though there might be some decision\nprocedure by which to make a rational decision to bring about that\nfuture self, that procedure is not the one related to the sense of\nself-interested that is under discussion.\n\nA response to this challenge requires choosing in a way that bridges\nthe gap between the pre-transformed agent and the future transformed\nself. Given the nature of transformative experience, it\u2019s\ndifficult to see how this could occur precisely since the\npre-transformed agent lacks the ability to connect in the right way to\nthe future transformed self. That connection goes beyond knowing the\nrelevant values, probabilities, and value functions. It gets at the\nagent\u2019s ability to choose authentically, to which\n \u00a75\n turns.\n",
