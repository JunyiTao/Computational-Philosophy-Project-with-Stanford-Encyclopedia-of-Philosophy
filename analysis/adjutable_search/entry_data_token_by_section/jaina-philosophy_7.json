    "main_text": "A complete worldview: metaphysics, taxonomies, cosmology || Of self and karma: which type of dualism for the Jaina philosopher\n2.4 Of self and karma: which type of dualism for the Jaina philosopher\n\nEach self is eternal and, as such, it has no beginning nor end. At the\nsame time, each self is constantly experiencing change, because it is\nessentially active. This is a core teaching of Jainism to which we\nwill come back in the\n section 3.4\n on epistemology, namely, that every existing thing is at the same\ntime persistent and changing (Baj\u017eelj 2013). This is one of the\ndoctrinal points that prompted Jaina thinkers to speak in terms of\nmany-sided objects of knowledge.\n\nNow, this means that even the omniscient one who fully manifests the\nqualities of consciousness still has modal variations on its\nconsciousness, like momentary and innately arising modes of absolute\nknowledge and of absolute perception that continuously succeed to one\nanother being qualitatively identical, just as the innately produced\nmodes of time are qualitatively identical to one another (Baj\u017eelj\n2018).\n\nBesides, this also means that contrarily to the S\u0101\u1e43khya\nview, modifications are not only in the realm of matter. Selves also\nare experiencing states.\n\nBut this, in turns, entails that a change happens both at the level of\nmatter and at the radically distinct level of selves. A phenomenon\nthat helps us understand how this works in the Jaina view is the\nfunctioning of \u201clife karma\u201d. First, death is not an end,\nbut a reappraisal of the entanglement of one self with matter,\nregulated by karma. The fact that the life karma decides the duration\nof one\u2019s life means nothing less that when one dies, say,\nbecause of a car accident, these external forces are only the material\ncause of the death of the embodied self, while the fruition of her\nlife karma is the efficient cause of her death. In such a conception,\ndeath happens as the fruit of the actions that one has herself\nperformed in a previous life.\n\nBefore we continue, it is worthy to note that one\u2019s acts do not\ngenuinely determine the moment of one\u2019s death in this life, but\nin the next one. Besides, when death happens, the most recent\nvolitional activities have an impact. All in all, one\u2019s very\nlast breath can influence the specific outcome of the determination of\nthe life karma for one\u2019s next life. This is what explains that\nthe Jains seek a good death. Such a good death is a death without\nstrong volitions, free from fears and desires. This, in turn, is what\nexplains the popularity of the ritual fast to death, called\n\u201csallekhana\u201d, and that has caused some legal and\ncultural turmoil in recent years.\n\nSecond, since everything is already determined at the moment of death,\none\u2019s transition from death to the being in a womb or other type\nof new type of life is considered instantaneous, there is no waiting\nperiod, since everything is already decided.\n\nTo come back to our main discussion, and try to understand how\none\u2019s acts in the previous life also engender a duration\ndetermination for this experience, a parallel with the process of\nsedimentation is helpful. Take a muddy water, leave it without any\nmovement for a sufficient amount of time, and the different types of\nsubstances involved in this mixture will separate, the more gross\nparticles being at the bottom. In this process, time differs for each\nmixture, since the speed of the disentanglement depends upon the\nnature of the substances involved. The same phenomenon happens with\nthe self and its bodies, since their type of entanglement in the\nprevious life mechanically has an effect on the lapse of time that the\nnext entanglement will last. And this has nothing to do with a\ndeserved punishment after some fault, nor with a deserved reward after\nsome good deed. This has to do with the laws of physics. In the\nTreatise on What There Is, we can find calculations such as\nthis one:\n\n\nTS 8.15. Bondage to life karma lasts up to thirty-three\nocean-measured periods (that is, 1/3 \u00d7 8,400,00 \u00d7 8,400,00\n\u00d7 107 years).\n\n\n\nWith the sedimentation metaphor, it is still not clear why the\nefficient cause of death, the exhaustion of one\u2019s life force, is\nnot enough, and why material factors are here also needed. This cannot\nmean that Jainism is a type of occasionalism, since originated\naggregates are efficient causes in their own realm. But at least, such\na conception is only possible if one conceives the world as a rational\nwhole in which things make sense together, even though only the\nomniscient ones can experience that.\n\nThe beginning of an answer to this question can be found in a second\ntradition, next to that of the Treatise on What There Is.\nThis tradition is that of Kundakunda. \u201cKundakunda\u201d is\nactually not a single author, but the name that stands for the\ncollective authorship of a Jaina textual tradition composed in Prakrit\n(Jaina \u015aaurasen\u012b) between the third and the eighth centuries\nCE around Karnataka in the South of India (Balcerowicz 2017).\nKundakunda\u2019s textual tradition is as influent as the TS, and is\nregularly revered as sacred texts in Jaina temples. This textual\ntradition represents within Jainism a movement focused on the self, in\nwhich the religious practice that matters is the inward experience\nthat is self-knowledge. The central teaching of Kundakunda in his\nEssence of the self (Samayas\u0101ra [SS\u0101]) is\nthat karmic matter is never genuinely mixed with the self. Therefore,\nit is close to S\u0101\u1e43khya conceptions, while keeping the Jaina\nspecificity of an essentially active self (Bronkhorst 2010). There,\nthe self is modified by modifications of consciousness\n(adhyavas\u0101na) and by states (bh\u0101va).\nHowever, it is possible to distinguish between different types of\nactivities, some of them not bringing about karmic retribution. And\nthis is exactly Kundakunda\u2019s move when he redefines the self as\nnot the agent of what happens in the material world of karma. For him,\nthe self is active only in its own domain. Concretely, the self is the\nmaterial cause only of the modifications of consciousness, while\nkarmic matter is the indirect instrumental cause of wrong\nmodifications of it. In turn, the self is the indirect instrumental\ncause of karmic modifications, but only as a king indirectly causes\nthe virtue in his subjects when he acts in a virtuous way and is taken\nas a model.\n\nTo summarize, we have seen in the Treatise on What There Is\nthat karmic matter and the self intermingle in the same way some\nliquids do, since their respective nature is not modified by this\nmixture and can get separated. Indeed, in muddy water, water actually\nstays water; while sedimentary dust actually stays sedimentary dust.\nThen, we have seen that in the Essence of the self, the\nassociation between the self and karmic matter can be though of in\nterms of kings acting as models. Another metaphor is that of a\nmirror-like crystal: if a flower reflected in a crystal is red, we see\nthe crystal as if it was red, while it is not. Likewise, the self sees\nattachment and wrong notions superposed with it, not being it. All in\nall, in both textual lineages, what really matters is that the\ntwo\u2014self and karmic matter\u2014keep their essential distinct\nnatures. Besides, the world is a whole in which things are\nmechanically combined together. Even though the types of substances\nare radically separated, they co-exist within the same conditions and\nso they experience synchronized modifications (Gorisse 2019).\n",
