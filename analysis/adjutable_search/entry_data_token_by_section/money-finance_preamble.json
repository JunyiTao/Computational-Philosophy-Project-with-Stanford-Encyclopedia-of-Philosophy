    "main_text": "\n\nFinance and philosophy may seem to be worlds apart. But they share at\nleast one common ancestor: Thales of Miletus. Thales is typically\nregarded as the first philosopher, but he was also a financial\ninnovator. He appears to have been what we would now call an option\ntrader. He predicted that next year\u2019s olive harvest would be\ngood, and therefore paid a small amount of money to the owners of\nolive presses for the right to the next year\u2019s use. When the\nharvest turned out to be as good as predicted, Thales earned a sizable\namount of money by renting out the presses (Aristotle,\nPolitics, 1259a).\n\nObviously, a lot has changed since Thales\u2019 times, both in\nfinance and in our ethical and political attitudes towards finance.\nCoins have largely been replaced by either paper or electronic money,\nand we have built a large infrastructure to facilitate transactions of\nmoney and other financial assets\u2014with elements including\ncommercial banks, central banks, insurance companies, stock exchanges,\nand investment funds. This institutional multiplicity is due to\nconcerted efforts of both private and public agents, as well as\ninnovations in financial economics and in the financial industry\n(Shiller 2012).\n\nOur ethical and political sensitivities have also changed in several\nrespects. It seems fair to say that most traditional ethicists held a\nvery negative attitude towards financial activities. Think, for\nexample, of Jesus\u2019 cleansing of the temple from moneylenders,\nand the widespread condemnation of money as \u201cthe root of all\nevil\u201d. Attitudes in this regard seem to have softened over time.\nHowever, the moral debate continues to recur, especially in connection\nwith large scandals and crises within finance, the largest such crisis\nin recent memory of course being the global financial crisis of\n2008.\n\nThis article describes what philosophical analysis can say about money\nand finance. It is divided into five parts that respectively concern\n(1) what money and finance really are (metaphysics), (2) how knowledge\nabout financial matters is or should be formed (epistemology), (3) the\nmerits and challenges of financial economics (philosophy of science),\n(4) the many ethical issues related to money and finance (ethics), and\n(5) the relationship between finance and politics (political\nphilosophy).\n",
