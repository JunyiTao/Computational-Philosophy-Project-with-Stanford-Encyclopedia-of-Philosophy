    "main_text": "\n\nPlato\u2019s discussions of rhetoric and poetry are both extensive and\ninfluential. As in so many other cases, he sets the agenda for the\nsubsequent tradition. And yet understanding his remarks about each of\nthese topics\u2014rhetoric and poetry\u2014presents us with\nsignificant philosophical and interpretive challenges. Further, it is\nnot initially clear why he links the two topics together so closely\n(he suggests that poetry is a kind of rhetoric). Plato certainly\nthought that matters of the greatest importance hang in the balance,\nas is clear from the famous statement that \u201cthere is an old\nquarrel between philosophy and poetry\u201d (Republic,\n607b5\u20136). In his dialogues, both this quarrel and the related\nquarrel between philosophy and rhetoric amount to clashes between\ncomprehensive world-views\u2014those of philosophy on the one hand,\nand of poetry or rhetoric on the other. What are these quarrels about?\nWhat does Plato mean by \u201cpoetry\u201d and\n\u201crhetoric\u201d? The purpose of this article is to analyze his\ndiscussions of rhetoric and poetry as they are presented in four\ndialogues: the Ion, the Republic, the\nGorgias, and the Phaedrus. Plato is (perhaps\nparadoxically) known for the poetic and rhetorical qualities of his own\nwritings, a fact which will also be discussed in what follows. \n",
