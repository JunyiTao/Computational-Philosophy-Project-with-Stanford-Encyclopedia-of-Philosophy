The dialogue is\ndedicated to George P\u00f3lya for his \u201crevival of\nmathematical heuristic\u201d and to Karl Popper for his critical\nphilosophy.\n\nProofs and Refutations is a highly original production. The\nissues it discusses are far removed from what was then standard fare\nin the philosophy of mathematics, dominated by logicism, formalism and\nintuitionism, all attempting to find secure foundations for\nmathematics. Its theses are radical. And its dialogue form makes it a\nliterary as well as a philosophical tour de force.\n\nIts official target is \u201cformalism\u201d or\n\u201cmetamathematics\u201d. But (as we have noted)\n\u201cformalism\u201d doesn\u2019t just mean\n\u201cformalism\u201d proper, as this term is usually understood in\nthe Philosophy of Mathematics. For Lakatos \u201cformalism\u201d\nincludes not just Hilbert\u2019s programme but also logicism and even\nintuitionism. Formalism sees mathematics as the derivation of theorems\nfrom axioms in formalised mathematical theories. The philosophical\nproject is to show that the axioms are true and the proofs valid, so\nthat mathematics can be seen as the accumulation of eternal truths. An\nadditional philosophical question is what these truths are\nabout, the question of mathematical ontology.\n\nLakatos, by contrast, was interested in the growth of\nmathematical knowledge. How were the axioms and the proofs discovered?\nHow does mathematics grow from informal conjectures and proofs into\nmore formal proofs from axioms? Logical empiricist (and Popperian)\northodoxy distinguished the \u201ccontext of discovery\u201d from\nthe \u201ccontext of justification\u201d, consigned the former to\nthe realm of empirical psychology, and thought it a matter of\n\u201cunregimented insight and good fortune\u201d, hardly a fit\nsubject for philosophical analysis. Philosophy of mathematics consists\nof the logical analysis of completed theories. Formalism manifests\nthis orthodoxy and \u201cdisconnects the history of mathematics from\nthe philosophy of mathematics\u201d (P&R: 1). Against the\northodoxy, Lakatos paraphrased Kant (the paraphrase has become almost\nas famous as the original):\n\n\nthe history of mathematics\u2026has become blind, while the\nphilosophy of mathematics\u2026 has become empty. (P&R:\n2)\n\n\n[Lakatos had stated this Kantian aphorism more generally at a\nconference in Oxford in 1961: \u201cHistory of science without\nphilosophy of science is blind. Philosophy of science without history\nof science is empty\u201d. See Hanson 1963: 458.]\n\nSuppose we agree with Lakatos that there is room for heuristics or a\nlogic or discovery. Still, orthodoxy could insist that discovery is\none thing, justification another, and that the genesis of ideas has\nnothing to do with their justification. Lakatos, more radically,\ndisputed this. First, he rejected the foundationalist or\njustificationist project altogether: mathematics has no foundation in\nlogic, or set theory, or anything else. Second, he insisted that the\nway in which a theory grows plays an essential role in its\nmethodological appraisal. This is as much a central theme of his\nphilosophy of empirical science as it is of his philosophy of\nmathematics.\n\nAs noted above, Proofs and Refutations takes the form of an\nimaginary dialogue between a teacher and a group of students. It\nreconstructs the history of attempts to prove the Descartes-Euler\nconjecture about polyhedra, namely, that for all polyhedra, the number\nof vertices minus the number of edges plus the\nnumber of faces is two (V \u2013 E + F = 2). The\nteacher presents an informal proof of this conjecture, due to Cauchy.\nThis is a \u201cthought experiment which suggest a decomposition\nof the original conjecture into subconjectures or lemmas\u201d\nfrom which the original conjecture is supposed to follow. We now have,\nas well as the original conjecture or conclusion, the subconjectures\nor premises, and the meta-conjecture that the latter entail the\nformer. Clearly, this kind of \u201cinformal proof\u201d is quite\ndifferent from the \u201cformalist\u201d idea that an informal proof\nis a formal proof with gaps (PP2: 63). Equally clearly, any of these\nconjectures might be refuted by counterexamples.\n\nIn the dialogue, the students, who are rather advanced, demonstrate\nthe point\u2014they demolish the Teacher\u2019s \u201cproof\u201d\nby producing counterexamples. The counterexamples are of three\nkinds:\n\n\n(1) Counterexamples to the conclusion that are not also\ncounterexamples to any of the premises (\u201cglobal but not local\ncounterexamples\u201d): These establish that the conclusion does not\nreally follow from the stated premises. They require us to improve the\nproof, to unearth the \u201chidden lemma\u201d which the\ncounterexample also refutes, so that it becomes a \u201clocal as well\nas global\u201d counterexample\u2014see (3), below.\n\n(2) Counterexamples to one of the premises that are not also\ncounterexamples to the conclusion (\u201clocal but not global\ncounterexamples\u201d): These require us to improve the proof by\nreplacing the refuted premise with a new premise which is not subject\nto the counterexample and which (we hope) will do as much to establish\nthe conclusion as the original refuted premise did.\n\n(3) Counterexamples both to the conclusion and to (at least one of)\nthe premises (\u201cglobal and local counterexamples\u201d): These\ncan be dealt with by incorporating the refuted premise or lemma into\nthe original conclusion, as a condition of its correctness. For\nexample, a picture-frame is a polyhedron with a hole or tunnel in\nit:\n\n\n\n\nSo if we define a polyhedron as \u201cnormal\u201d if it has no\nholes or tunnels in it, we can restrict the original conjecture to\n\u201cnormal\u201d polyhedra and avoid this refutation. The trouble\nwith this method is that it reduces the content of the original\nconjecture, and an empty tautology threatens\u2014\u201cFor all\nEulerian polyhedra (polyhedra for which \\(V - E + F = 2\\)V\n\u2013 E + F = 2), V \u2013 E + F = 2\\(V - E +\nF = 2\\)\u201d. More particularly, a blanket exclusion of polyhedra\nwith holes or tunnels rules out some polyhedra for which \\(V - E + F =\n2\\), despite the presence of a hole\u2014a cube with a\nsquare hole drilled through it and two ring-shaped faces being an\nexample \u2013 the formula V \u2013 E + F = 2 holds\ngood. This suggests a deeper problem than finding the domain of\nvalidity of the original conjecture\u2014finding a general\nrelationship between V, E and F for all polyhedra\nwhatsoever.\n\n\nWe see from this analysis what Lakatos calls the \u201cdialectical\nunity of proofs and refutations\u201d. Counterexamples help us to\nimprove our proof by finding hidden lemmas. And proofs help us improve\nour conjecture by finding conditions on its validity. Either way, or\nboth ways, mathematical knowledge grows. And as it grows, its concepts\nare refined. We begin with a vague, unarticulated notion of what a\npolyhedron is. We have a conjecture about polyhedra and an informal\nproof of it. Counterexamples or refutations \u201cstretch\u201d our\noriginal concept: is a picture frame a genuine polyhedron, or a\ncylinder, or two polyhedra joined along a single edge?\n\n\n\n\nAttempts to rescue our conjecture from refutation yield\n\u201cproof-generated definitions\u201d like that of a \u201cnormal\npolyhedron\u201d.\n\nIs there any limit to this process of\n\u201cconcept-stretching\u201d, or any distinction to be drawn\nbetween interesting and frivolous concept-stretching? Can this process\nyield, not fallible conjectures and proofs, but certainty?\nLakatos\u2019s editors distinguish the certainty of proofs from the\ncertainty of the axioms from which all proofs must proceed. They claim\nthat rigorous proof-procedures have been attained, and that\n\u201cThere is no serious sense in which such proofs are\nfallible\u201d (P&R: 57). Quite so. But only because we have\ndecided not to \u201cstretch\u201d the logical concepts that lie\nbehind those rigorous and formalizable proof-procedures. A rigorous\nproof in classical logic may not be valid in intuitionistic or\nparaconsistent logics. And the key point is that a proof, however\nrigorous, only establishes that if the axioms are true,\nthen so is the theorem. If the axioms themselves remain\nfallible, then so do the theorems rigorously derived from them.\nProviding foundations for mathematics requires the axioms to be made\ncertain, by deriving them from logic or set theory or something else.\nLakatos claimed that this foundational project had collapsed (see\nbelow,\n \u00a73.2).\n\nTo what extent is this imaginary dialogue a contribution to the\nhistory of mathematics? Lakatos explained that\n\n\nThe dialogue form should reflect the dialectic of the story: it is\nmeant to contain a sort of rationally reconstructed or\n\u201cdistilled\u201d history. The real history will chime in in the\nfootnotes, most of which are to be taken, therefore, as an organic\npart of the essay (P&R: 5).\n\n\nThis device, first necessitated by the dialogue form, became a\npervasive theme of Lakatos\u2019s writings. It was to attract much\ncriticism, most of it centred around the question whether rationally\nreconstructed history was real history at all. The trouble is that the\nrational and the real can come apart quite radically. At one point in\nProofs and Refutations a character in the dialogue makes a\nhistorical claim which, according to the relevant footnote, is false.\nLakatos says that the statement\n\n\nalthough heuristically correct (i.e. true in a rational\nhistory of mathematics) is historically false. This should not worry\nus: actual history is frequently a caricature of its rational\nreconstructions. (P&R: 21)\n\n\nOn occasions, Lakatos\u2019s sense of humour ran away with him, as\nwhen the text contains a made-up quotation from Galileo, and the\nfootnote says that he \u201cwas unable to trace this quotation\u201d\n(P&R: 62). (Though this does rather smack of his youthful habit of\nwinning arguments with \u201cbourgeois\u201d students by fabricating\non-the-spot quotations from the authorities they respected. See Bandy\n2009: 122.) Horrified critics protested that rationally reconstructed\nhistory is a caricature of real history, not in fact real history at\nall but rather \u201cphilosophy fabricating examples\u201d. One\ncritic said that philosophers of science should not be allowed to\nwrite history of science. This academic trade unionism is misguided.\nYou do not falsify history by pointing out that what ought to have\nhappened did not, in fact, happen.\n\nThere is an important pedagogic point to all this, too. The dialectic\nof proofs and refutations can generate, in the ways explained above,\nquite complicated definitions of mathematical concepts, definitions\nthat can only really be understood by considering the process that\ngave rise to them. But mathematics teaching is not historical, or even\nquasi-historical. (One sense in which Lakatos\u2019s theory is\ndialectical: it represents a process as rational even though the terms\nof the debate are not clearly defined.) But students nowadays are\npresented with the latest definitions at the outset, and required to\nlearn them and apply them, without ever really understanding them.\n\nOne question about Proofs and Refutations is whether the\nheuristic patterns depicted in it apply to the whole of mathematics.\nWhile some aspects clearly are peculiar to the particular case-study\nof polyhedra, the general patterns are not. Lakatos himself applied\nthem in a second case-study, taken from the history of analysis in the\nnineteenth century (\u201cCauchy and the Continuum\u201d,\n1978c).\n",
