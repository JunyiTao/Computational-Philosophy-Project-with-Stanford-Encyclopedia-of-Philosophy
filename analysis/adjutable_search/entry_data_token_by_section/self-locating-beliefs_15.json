Self-Location in Decision Theory and Formal Epistemology\n\nAmong the many things that happen in his 1979 paper, Lewis makes the\nfollowing comment in passing:\n\n\nIt is interesting to ask what happens to decision theory if we take\nall attitudes as de se. Answer: very little. We replace the\nspace of worlds by the space of centered worlds, or by the space of\nall inhabitants of worlds. All else is just as before. Whatever the\npoints of the space of possibilities may be, we have probability\ndistributions over the space and assignments of utility values to the\npoints. For any rational agent at any time there is a pair of a\nprobability distribution and a utility assignment. The probabilities\nchange under the impact of his perception; the probabilities and\nutilities jointly govern his action. (1979: 534)\n\n\nYet incorporating self-locating attitudes into decision theory takes a\nlittle more work than the \u201cvery little\u201d Lewis supposed (as\nLewis himself acknowledged in a footnote to his 1996 (n. 6, pp.\n309\u201310)). The trouble comes when we ask how self-locating\ndoxastic states change over time. Formal decision theories have\nupdating rules to manage these transitions. We will focus on how\nself-locating states interact with Bayesian updating rules (see entry\non\n Bayesian epistemology);\n similar problems arise on other updating formalisms of which we are\naware.\n\nStart with a Lewisian approach to self-locating states. Decision\ntheory works with numerical degrees of belief\u2014or\n\u201ccredences\u201d\u2014rather than full beliefs. Following\nLewis, we may distribute credences over a space of centered worlds (or\nproperties) rather than uncentered possible worlds. On this approach,\nwhen John learns that he is the messy shopper, his credence in the\ncentered proposition associated with \u201cI am the messy\nshopper\u201d increases dramatically. The Bayesian updating rule\ncalled \u201cConditionalization\u201d handles this transition\neasily. For instance, we can model John as conditionalizing on that\ncentered proposition, sending it from a middling or low degree of\nconfidence in his mind to certainty.\n\nThe trouble comes when we go in the other direction.\nConditionalization famously sends propositions to certainty then keeps\nthem there ever-after. Suppose that around 11:30 am, Perry\u2019s\nprofessor is certain of the proposition associated with \u201cIt is\nnot now noon\u201d. On Lewis\u2019s approach, the professor loses\nconfidence in that proposition as time passes. But Conditionalization\ncannot model drops from certainty to lower degrees of confidence.\n(Similarly, Conditionalization cannot model increases from no credence\nto a positive value, so when the time comes to recognize that\nit\u2019s noon and go to his meeting, the professor won\u2019t be\nable to do that either.)\n\nConditionalization was designed to model an idealized process in which\nagents accumulate information to hone in on non-self-locating\nhypotheses whose truth-values remain constant (e.g., the atomic\nnumber of lead is 82). The model founders when propositions\nchange their truth-values as the accumulation occurs.\nConditionalization wasn\u2019t designed to hit moving targets.\nNeither, for that matter, was Jeffrey\u2019s (1965)\n\u201cprobability kinematics\u201d; Namjoong Kim (2009) shows that\nJeffrey\u2019s update rule fails just as badly as Conditionalization\nwhen applied to credences in Lewisian centered propositions. (Of\ncourse, decision theory involves not only credence but also utility\nassignments, and the latter may be self-locating just as easily as the\nformer. Decision theories usually assume that utility distributions\nremain constant, and so typically have not bothered to offer utility\nupdating schemes. But if we introduce utilities in self-locating\npropositions\u2014I\u2019d get higher utility from addressing that\nproblem tomorrow than today\u2014then such updating\nschemes may become needed!)\n\nPerhaps the culprit is taking self-locating attitudes to be directed\nat such moving targets; perhaps self-locating credences are not\nattitudes adopted towards Lewisian propositions. Since around\n2008\u2014spurred in large part by Elga\u2019s (2000) introduction\nof the \u201cSleeping Beauty Problem\u201d to the philosophical\nliterature\u2014a number of self-locating update schemes have been\nproposed. Most work with formal models built on Lewisian contents,\nthough some authors have employed other structures: Chalmers (2011)\nprimary intensions; Braun (2016) Russellian propositions with guises;\nStalnaker (2008) more complex centered-worlds constructions.\nNevertheless, as of this writing a general consensus has emerged that\nno matter what theoretical account one gives of doxastic states, the\nBayesian updating rules of Conditionalization and Jeffrey\nConditionalization will have to be amended or supplemented in some\nway.\n\nTo understand the rival amendments proposed, return to our\n section 5\n discussion of communication, and imagine that the individuals\ncoordinating doxastic states are an earlier and later edition of the\nsame agent. In linguistic communication we usually think of a\nspeaker\u2019s utterance as directly producing a single doxastic\nstate in the addressee, then indirectly producing knock-on addressee\nstates which follow from that one. Communication from an earlier to a\nlater self doesn\u2019t have this bottleneck structure; the present\nme directly inherited a whole slew of doxastic states from myself a\nmoment ago. Still, in formal updating it\u2019s useful to start by\naligning just one of the later agent\u2019s states with a state of\nthe earlier agent, then to work out the rest of the later\nagent\u2019s states from that one.\n\nFor instance, Kim (2009) adopts a recentering approach, on which an\nagent\u2019s Thursday credence that it rained yesterday is\ncoordinated with her Wednesday credence that it rains today.\nOther credences of the later self (e.g., credence that it rains on\nWednesday) may be worked out from that one. (Further recentering\napproaches are offered by Meacham 2010; Schulz 2010; and Schwarz\n2012.) Halpern (2005) and Meacham (2008), on the other hand, adopt\ndecentering approaches on which the crucial updating step coordinates\ncredences in uncentered propositions (that it rains on\nWednesday). Stalnaker (2008) and Moss (2012) offer decentered\nvariants in which the crucial uncentered propositions are de\nre (it rains on that day). Titelbaum (2013a)\ndevelops a restriction model, focused on the transfer of\n\u201cepistemically context-insensitive\u201d doxastic\nstates\u2014states that both the earlier and later selves are certain\ndo not change truth-values between the two times. (The category of\n\u201cepistemically context-sensitive\u201d may also include states\nbeyond the explicitly self-locating. For instance, an epistemologist\nwho\u2019s a contextualist about knowledge attributions may\nanticipate that the truth-value of \u201cBob knows he has\nhands\u201d will change across contexts.) Titelbaum articulates\nconditions under which epistemically context-insensitive states can be\ntrusted to convey all the relevant information from earlier to later\nself, and discusses how to update when these conditions aren\u2019t\nmet.\n\nFor a survey of the strengths and blindspots of all these updating\napproaches, see Titelbaum (2016). To get a sense how one might argue\nfor some of the approaches over others, see Briggs (2010) and Kierland\n& Monton (2005). For applications of self-locating update to other\nphilosophical topics of interest (indifference principles, quantum\nmechanics, the multiverse, etc.), see Titelbaum (2013b).\n",
