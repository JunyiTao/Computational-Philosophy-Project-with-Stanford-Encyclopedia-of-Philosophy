    "main_text": "Logic\n2. Logic\n\n\nThis section describes Sylvan\u2019s work in logic. As in other\nareas of his philosophy, Sylvan was notable for his staunch defence of\nhighly controversial and radical views\u2014most strikingly, that\nclassical logic is wrong, that non-classical logic is right, and that\nsome contradictions may be true (see: dialetheism). What makes\nhis work worth remembering is that he backed up such claims with\nrigorous (if contentious) arguments and mathematical details.\n\n\nSylvan\u2019s work in logic can be viewed in part as a response to\na wide range of paradoxes, such as the paradoxes of\nself-reference (like the Liar Paradox). He was equally focused on\nparadoxes of implication, and so was a leading developer of\nrelevant logics, logics characterized by their concern that\nthere be a meaningful connection between the antecedent and consequent\nof a conditional. These topics would lead him to be one of the founders\nof the so-called \u201cAustralasian school\u201d of\nparaconsistent logic, logics that tolerate inconsistency\nwithout incoherence. He was perennially concerned with the\nuniversality of logic. Along with intrinsic interest, his\nlogical research was always motivated by its eventual application to\nissues in metaphysics, ethics, and beyond.\n",
