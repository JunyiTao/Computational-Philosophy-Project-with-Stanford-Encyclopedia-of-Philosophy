    "main_text": "The Ingredients of Medieval Philosophy || Translation Movements\n1.3 Translation Movements\n\nAncient texts were transmitted to medieval thinkers and the different\nbranches of the medieval tradition influenced one another\u2019s\ndevelopment through a series of translation\n movements.[7]\n1.3.1 Greek to Arabic\n\nThe School of Alexandria was closed by the Muslim conquest in 641, but\nbetween the eighth and the early tenth century, much of the treasury\nof Greek scientific and philosophical texts it left was put into\nArabic, often by Syriac speaking Christians and sometimes through the\nintermediary of Syriac. Almost the whole of Aristotle was translated,\nalong with commentaries from the Platonic schools and works\nby\u00a0the Aristotelian,\n Alexander of Aphrodisias\n (working c. AD 200) (Gutas 1998). Reworked versions of texts by\n Plotinus\n and the fifth-century Platonist\n Proclus\n were also made in Arabic, but Plato himself was hardly known except\nthrough translations of epitomes. (See also\n Greek sources in Arabic and Islamic philosophy.)\n1.3.2 Greek to Latin\n\nTranslation from Greek into Latin went on almost continuously.\nWritings by philosophically acute Greek Church Fathers were translated\nin antiquity; in the fourth century, Calcidius translated part of\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus, with an extensive commentary.\n Boethius\n (476\u2013c. 525) translated Aristotle\u2019s logic and, in his\ncommentaries and textbooks, translating, selecting and rethinking,\nmade available in Latin large amounts of the teachings on Aristotelian\nlogic from the Platonic Schools. His Consolation of\nPhilosophy, written as a prosimetric dialogue when Boethius was\nunder sentence of death, was one of the most widely read and\ntranslated texts in the Middle Ages: it was not a translation, but\ntransmitted Boethius\u2019s own understanding of late ancient\nPlatonism. Translations of pseudo-Dionysius and Maximus the Confessor\nwere made in the ninth century\n (\u00a72.1,\n \u00a72.2), and of John of Damascus (c. 660\u2013c. 750) in the\ntwelfth century. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the rest of\nAristotle untranslated by Boethius\u2014his non-logical works and the\nPosterior Analytics\u2014was put into Latin, sometimes first\nvia Arabic; (Plato\u2019s Phaedo and Meno were also\ntranslated, by Henry Aristippus, but they remained almost unknown).\nThe greatest of these translators was William of Moerbeke\n(1215\u20131286), who made or produced by version\u00a0very accurate,\nextremely literal translations from the Greek of all Aristotle\u2019s\nworks, and texts by the late ancient Platonists Proclus,\n Ammonius\n and\n Simplicius.\n In the fifteenth century, there were many more translations from the\nGreek, such as those of Plato and Plotinus by\n Marsilio Ficino\n (1433\u201399).\n1.3.3 Arabic to Latin\n\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, especially in Toledo and\nSicily, a large variety of Arabic texts were translated into Latin.\nThey included Arabic translations of some of Aristotle\u2019s own\ntexts, which helped to fill in gaps before direct translations from\nthe Greek were available, and works by the Arabic thinkers who worked\nin the tradition of Aristotle and the ancient philosophers:\nal-Kind\u012b, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Solomon ibn Gabirol (a\nJew, but unrecognizable as such from his text) and, most important,\nparts, including the sections on the soul and on metaphysics, from\nAvicenna\u2019s largest encyclopaedic reworking of Aristotle, and\nmany of Averroes\u2019s commentaries on Aristotle. These\ntranslations, along with the translations of Aristotle, transformed\nthe university syllabuses in the thirteenth century\n (\u00a72.7).\n1.3.4 Arabic to Hebrew\n\nWhen Jews living in Latin Europe began to engage in philosophy, using\nHebrew, their language of law and liturgy, they turned primarily to\nworks in Arabic. A central text was Maimonides\u2019s Guide of\nthe Perplexed\n (\u00a72.4),\n translated into Hebrew twice soon after it was written, and a few\nother Jewish philosophical texts were also translated. During the\nthirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, translators also provided\nan almost complete Aristotelian curriculum but, although there were\nsome direct translations, it was mostly by way of Averroes\u2019s\nshort and middle paraphrase commentaries, and\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s short commentaries for the logic.\nOther translations include al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s Intentions\nof the Philosophers\n (\u00a72.4)\n and Ibn Tufayl\u2019s philosophical novel\n (\u00a72.6).\n1.3.5 Latin to Greek\n\nOne group of Byzantine philosophers in the thirteenth to fifteenth\ncenturies was strongly interested by Latin thought. The texts its\nmembers translated into Greek included works by Augustine and\nBoethius, Thomas Aquinas, and Anselm, as well as part of Peter of\nSpain\u2019s popular Treatise on logic.\n1.3.6 Latin to Hebrew\n\nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries some works by a variety of\nLatin university authors, among them Boethius, Aquinas,\n Albert the Great\n and William of Ockham were put into Hebrew, and also Peter of\nSpain\u2019s Treatise (Manekin 1996). There was even a\nHebrew translation of Averroes\u2019s Great Commentary on On the\nSoul\n (\u00a72.6)\n made in the fifteenth century from the Latin, because the Arabic\noriginal was lost.\n1.3.7 Hebrew to Latin\n\nMaimonides\u2019s Guide\n (\u00a72.6)\n was translated into Latin in the thirteenth century from one of its\nHebrew translations. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, there\nwas a spate of Latin translations of Hebrew versions of Averroes, but\nvery little of Jewish philosophy in Hebrew was ever put into Latin\n(Manekin 1996).\n1.4 Other Philosophical Sources\n\nAs well as drawing on ancient Greek philosophy via the late ancient\nPlatonic Schools, each of the four main branches of medieval\nphilosophy had its own special sources.\n\nFor Byzantine philosophy, there were philosophically educated\nGreek Christian authors, such as\n Origen\n (c. 184\u2013c. 253) and from the fourth century Basil, Gregory of\nNyssa and Gregory Nazianzen.\nThe greatest influence on medieval Latin philosophy, as well as,\nby some chronologies, the founder of the tradition, was\n Augustine\n (354\u2013430). Augustine\u2019s thought was shaped in part by\nPlotinus and Porphyry, some of whose texts he read in Latin\ntranslation; in part by his personal experience of the competing\nfaiths of his time\u2014Christianity, Manichaeism, Graeco-Roman\npaganism; in part by a Latin philosophical and literary tradition; and\nin the greatest part by his own, relentless self-critical genius as a\nthinker. Latin philosophers also had direct access to eras of ancient\nphilosophy earlier than the Platonism of Plotinus through Latin\nauthors, such as Cicero (scepticism, stoicism), Seneca\n(stoicism).\nIn Arabic, there was the tradition of kal\u0101m theology\n (\u00a72.4).\n Philosophical thought about language was sometimes linked to Arabic\ngrammatical thought and both it and ethics to adab, the\ntradition of literary and historical studies needed to make a person\ncultivated. Sufism\u2014an Islamic mystical tradition\u2014also\ndeeply influenced some philosophers\n (\u00a72.4,\n \u00a72.6,\n \u00a72.10).\nJewish thinkers inherited, not just the written Law of the Torah,\nbut oral law, recorded in the Mishna and the tradition of Talmudic\ncommentary on it. The central Jewish philosopher, Maimonides\n (\u00a72.6)\n is also the greatest of the Talmudic scholars.\n\n2. Styles of Medieval Philosophy\n2.1 Byzantine Philosophy (c. 450\u2013c. 1450)\n\nThinkers in what had been the Eastern Roman Empire\u2014they thought\nof themselves as Romans; we call them\n\u201cByzantines\u201d\u2014needed no translation movement to\naccess the heritage of the ancient\n schools.[8]\n In theory, the whole of the ancient tradition lay within their grasp.\nBut not only did this lead to encyclopaedism, as in the case of\nPhotius (820\u201391), whose Bibliotheca is an enormous\ncollection from ancient authors, philosophers included. It also made\nthe Church authorities suspect that commentators who went beyond logic\nwould be guilty of \u201chellenism\u201d\u2014putting loyalty to\ntheir Greek cultural tradition above Christian doctrine. Of the three\nmost adventurous Aristotelian commentators, Michael Psellus\n(1018\u201396), John Italos (1025\u201385) and Eustratius of Nicaea\n(c. 1050\u2013c. 1120), only the first escaped condemnation. Four\nhundred years later, in the twilight of Byzantine civilization,\nGemistos Plethon (c. 1360\u20131454), gave substance to these fears\nthrough his devotion to Plato and pagan Platonism (Siniossoglou\n2011).\n\nSome historians restrict Byzantine philosophy to this tradition, based\non the ancient texts of Aristotle and, occasionally, Plato and his\n followers.[9]\n But there were two other strands to philosophy in Byzantium. One is\nthat of those thinkers after 1200 who looked to Latin thought\n (\u00a71.3.5).\n The other goes back to the philosophically-inclined Greek Christian\nFathers, and above all to the (probably) Syrian monk who, late in the\nfifth century, issued a set of writings under the name of Dionysius,\nthe Athenian Areopagite (learned judge) converted by St Paul. The\nauthor had read the near contemporary pagan Platonist Proclus, who\nenvisaged a many-tiered universe, deriving ultimately from a One,\nbeyond even being.\n Pseudo-Dionysius\n substituted the Christian God for the One, and where Proclus\naccommodated the pagan pantheon on the elaborately triadic rungs of\nhis pantheon, he placed the angels and the Church hierarchy. Maximus\nthe Confessor, schooled in ancient philosophy though hostile to it,\ndeveloped pseudo-Dionysius\u2019s thinking, especially his negative\ntheology. This line of Byzantine thinking has its most powerful later\nexpression in the work of a monk of Mount Athos, Gregory Palamas\n(1296\u20131359), who combined the theme of God\u2019s unknowability\nwith the idea that he does make himself manifest even in this life to\nsome people who are helped by a special sort of\n\u201chesychastic\u201d (still, silent) prayer.\n2.2 The Rule and Two Exceptions: Latin Philosophy, 800\u20131100\n\nPhilosophical thinking took place in the monasteries and, later,\ncathedral schools in Latin Europe in the ninth to eleventh centuries,\nalthough it was first stimulated at the end of the eighth century by\nAlcuin, Theodulf of Orleans and other scholars at the court of\n Charlemagne.[10]\n Based on the seven Liberal Arts (the trivium: grammar, logic,\nrhetoric; the quadrivium: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music), it\nwas usually focused on the first two. Grammar ran from elementary\nlanguage learning to complex semantic analysis. Logic, at first known\nfrom encyclopaedic accounts and Roman textbooks, was studied from the\nlate tenth century on the basis of Boethius\u2019s translations of\nand commentaries on Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge and\nAristotle\u2019s Categories and On Interpretation\nand his own textbooks. Boethius\u2019s Short Theological\nTreatises and Consolation of Philosophy were also used\nas school texts. Augustine\u2019s works were not, but they were\nextensively read and so provided another source, and inspiration, for\nphilosophers. In these centuries Latin philosophy acquired the\nemphasis on linguistic analysis and logic it would develop further in\nthe twelfth century and retain in the universities, even when there\nwere many more ancient sources available.\n\nThe two outstanding Latin thinkers of the time shared to some extent\nthis style of thinking and yet were in many respects complete\nexceptions to it.\n John Scottus Eriugena,\n an Irishman who worked at the court of Charles the Bald in northern\nFrance from c. 850\u2013c. 870, learned Greek, translated\npseudo-Dionysius and Maximus the Confessor and absorbed their ideas.\nHis masterpiece, the Periphyseon, systematizes and takes to\nits rational conclusion the line of thought they drew from Proclus\n(and ultimately Plotinus and Plato). Eriugena uses his\ncontemporaries\u2019 favourite logical textbook, a Latin paraphrase\nof Aristotle\u2019s Categories, to argue that God is not\namong the things that exist, before showing how he is manifest, never\nin himself, but in the appearances that make up the story of the\nworld\u2019s creation, the Fall, and the final Return of all\nthings.\n\nBorn in Aosta,\n Anselm\n (1033\u20131109) became a monk at Bec in Northern France and,\neventually, Archbishop of Canterbury. At a time when thinkers referred\nostentatiously to their authoritative sources, ancient and patristic,\nAnselm wrote dialogues and monographs that scarcely mentioned an\nauthor. Having fully absorbed both Boethian logic and many facets of\nAugustine\u2019s thought, he could use them to engage in his own\nreasoning. He not only hit on\u2014by his own account in a flash of\ninspiration\u2014an unprecedented argument for God\u2019s existence\n(the \u201cOntological Proof\u201d; see entry on\n ontological arguments),\n but elaborated and brilliantly advocated a notion of the will\u2019s\nfreedom Augustine had the sense to avoid, which cast a long shadow\nfrom Scotus to Kant and beyond.\n2.3 Falsafa\n\nThe abundant translations of Greek philosophical texts\n (\u00a71.3.1)\n made it possible for some thinkers in the Islamicate world themselves\nto engage in the Greek-style philosophizing they called\n falsafa.[11]\n Its exponents (fal\u0101sifa; sing. faylasuf) did\nnot, however, fit into the educational system, based around Islamic\nlaw. The earliest faylasuf was the prince and polymath\n al-Kind\u012b\n (c. 801\u201366), who was especially attracted to\u00a0Platonist\nmaterial. In the next century, a circle of Peripatetics, Muslim and\nChristian, flourished in Baghdad, dedicated to the close study and\nexegesis of Aristotle\u2019s texts. The most outstanding,\n al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\n (c. 870\u2013950/1), wrote shorter and longer commentaries on\nAristotle, including a discursive exposition of On\nInterpretation full of original thought about both semantics and\ndeterminism. Elsewhere, he provides a naturalistic account of the\norigins of language, philosophy and religion, and he championed the\nview, adopted by other faylasuf, that in their discipline\nthey provide demonstrative science (as described by Aristotle in the\nPosterior Analytics)\n (\u00a74.1).\n His view of the ideal state is clearly influenced by knowledge of\nPlato (through epitomes) and is linked to his conception of the order\nof the universe, which melds Proclus\u2019s theory of emanation from\nthe One with Ptolemean cosmology (see entries on\n al-Farabi\u2019s metaphysics,\n al-Farabi\u2019s psychology and epistemology,\n al-Farabi\u2019s philosophy of logic and language,\n al-Farabi\u2019s philosophy of society and religion).\n\nUnquestionably the most important faylasuf\u2014fundamental\nto the subsequent Arabic Islamic tradition, but highly influential too\non Jewish and Latin philosophy\u2014was\n Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\n (before 980\u20131037; known in Latin as \u201cAvicenna\u201d, see\nentries on\n Ibn Sina\u2019s logic,\n Ibn Sina\u2019s metaphysics,\n Ibn Sina\u2019s natural philosophy).\n Avicenna was born in present-day Uzbekistan and spent his life in the\nEastern part of the Islamicate world, serving various princes in the\narea (he was also a renowned doctor and writer on medicine). He\ndistinguished his approach sharply from that of the\n\u201cWesterners\u201d, the Baghdad Peripatetics. Like them, he\nconsidered himself an Aristotelian. But whereas they sought to expound\nAristotle\u2019s texts line by line, Avicenna believed his genius\nallowed him to present the underlying truth in Aristotle\u2019s\nthought, by rearranging, rethinking and systematizing it. His output\nconsisted mostly, therefore, of philosophical encyclopaedias each\ncovering much of the range of Aristotle\u2019s work,\nlonger\u2014such as The Cure\u2014or shorter\u2014such as\nPointers and Reminders, the presentation most distant from\nAristotle\u2019s texts and most studied by his Arabic successors.\n\nFor Avicenna, as for al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, God moves the universe\nnot just as final cause, but as that from which emanate the series of\nIntelligences and celestial spheres, down to the Agent Intellect,\ngiver of forms to our sublunar world and so assurer of the continued\nregularity of nature. His innovation was to identify this first cause\nas the one necessary being, that which is necessary through itself:\nits nature is to exist and so it cannot but exist. All other things\nare merely possible in themselves, but necessary through\nanother\u2014that is, through God, the necessary being. Since\nAvicenna\u2019s God, like that of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, the\nPlatonists and Aristotle himself, is not a being that chooses and\nwills, his theory of necessity in itself and through another binds the\nwhole history of the universe to a very strict Principle of Sufficient\nReason.\n2.4 Kal\u0101m\n\nA century before al-Kind\u012b, a different style of philosophizing\nhad grown up in the Islamic world:\n kal\u0101m.[12]\n It has, indeed, been suggested that falsafa originated as a\nrival to kal\u0101m\u2014claiming to be a better way of\nexplaining the world than it could offer. Kal\u0101m was\nbased on problems suggested by the Quran, but it was also inspired by\nthe need to defend Islamic doctrine against philosophically based\nattacks by Christians and may have been informed by some ideas from\nthe ancient Greek tradition. The dominant school of\nkal\u0101m in the ninth century were the Mu\u02bftazilites.\nThey were very confident in the ability of human reason to reach moral\ntruth, to which, they held, God\u2019s justice must\n correspond.[13]\n They strongly emphasized God\u2019s unity and, in common with other\nkal\u0101m thinkers, developed an atomistic, materialistic\nphysics, very different from Aristotle\u2019s picture of a stable\nworld of substances belonging to natural kinds. A Jewish version of\nkal\u0101m is found in the work of\n Saadya\n (882\u2013942).[14]\n\nAl-Ash\u2018ar\u012b (d. 935/6) changed the direction of\nkal\u0101m. He stressed the absolute omnipotence of God, who,\nhe said, from instant to instant is responsible for the arrangement of\nthe atoms, and for human will and action. A century later, however,\nal-Juwayn\u012b (1028\u201385) began to introduce Avicennian notions\ninto kal\u0101m. His pupil,\n al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\n (1058\u20131111) went far further.\n\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b studied kal\u0101m theology, Avicennian\nphilosophy and Sufism, a type of Islamic mysticism, and he wrote about\nthem all, as well as being one of the greatest Muslim legal theorists.\nAmong these writings are not just The Intentions of the\nPhilosophers, based on Avicenna\u2019s shortest philosophical\nencyclopaedia (in Persian), but The Incoherence of the\nPhilosophers, directed against falsafa as presented by\nAvicenna. This book was very influential, and al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\nused to be thought of as a diehard enemy of philosophy, who helped to\nbring about the end of philosophizing in the Islamic world. In fact,\nhowever, there are just three doctrines on which al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\nconvicts Avicenna and his followers of heresy: the eternity of the\nworld\n (\u00a73.1),\n the restriction of God\u2019s knowledge to universals and the denial\nof the bodily resurrection\n (\u00a73.3).\n His critique thus showed that, in general, so long as these\nconclusions are avoided, Avicennian philosophy is acceptable for\nMuslims. Indeed, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b himself accepted it, but with\ntwo important further changes. God, he insists, has will and is\ncapable of real choices between alternatives. Moreover\u2014and this\nis the central point of the Incoherence\u2014the\nphilosophers such as Avicenna do not, as they claim\n (\u00a72.3),\n provide demonstrative knowledge, because the starting points for\ntheir arguments are not all self-evident. Like the theologians, their\nreasoning is dialectical (Griffel 2009).\n2.5 The Twelfth-Century Parisian Schools\n\nParis became the centre of philosophy in Latin Europe in the twelfth\ncentury, in part because the cathedral authorities, rather than just\nrunning one school, allowed many, competing ones: masters flocked\nthere, and students began to head to Paris from all over\n Europe.[15]\n\nMany of these masters concentrated on the logical curriculum, little\nchanged since the late tenth century, but now its texts had been\nthoroughly absorbed. This curriculum gave them the opportunity, not\njust to make advances in what is still considered logic, but also to\ndevelop a whole metaphysics, starting not from Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics\u2014which they did not know\u2014but his\nCategories. The boldest of all these metaphysicians was\n Peter Abelard\n (1079\u20131142). Aristotle\u2019s Categories seems to\nimply that, as well as particular substances (this man, that dog) and\nparticular forms (this rationality, that whiteness), there are also\nuniversal substances and forms. Abelard did not agree, and he tried to\nconstruct the world and interpret Aristotle without admitting that any\nuniversals exist. He also attended to the ontological status of what\nsentences say\u2014their dicta. Dicta play a\ncentral role in his understanding of truth and of the basis of logical\nconsequence, but, he insists, they are not things at all. Gilbert of\nPoitiers (c. 1085\u201390\u20131154) constructed an even more\ncomplex metaphysical system, based on the distinction between types of\ndiscourse (natural, \u201cmathematical\u201d, theological,\nethical).\n\nBoth men, and their often innovative followers (Abelard\u2019s were\nthe nominales, Gilbert\u2019s the Porretani) in the\nsecond half of the century, also wrote on theology. Indeed,\nGilbert\u2019s surviving works are all theological, the most\nimportant of them a commentary on Boethius\u2019s short theological\ntreatises. Gilbert tried, unsuccessfully, to establish the method\nBoethius used in his Short Theological Treatises\u2014of\ngoing as far as possible with parallels between natural phenomena and\nsacred mysteries, and pointing out where he has to stop\u2014as\nstandard. Abelard\u2019s own particular theological ideas\u2014which\nincluded an (arguably) rationalizing approach to the Trinity, and the\nview that, unlike humans, God cannot act otherwise than he\ndoes\u2014were generally rejected, and some of them condemned. But\nhis method of trying to reconcile apparently contradictory\nauthoritative texts through conceptual analysis was widely adopted by\nhis contemporaries and would form the basis for later medieval\ntheology.\n\nOther approaches to philosophy, less centred on logic and theology,\nwere also developed, especially outside Paris. William of Conches (d.\nafter 1155) concentrated on expounding texts such as Boethius\u2019s\nConsolation and Plato\u2019s Timaeus, and on\nphysical science, in which he regarded Plato as an authority.\n2.6 Islamic Spain, c. 1050\u2013c. 1200\n\nJust as a very particular way of doing philosophy grew up in\ntwelfth-century Paris, so at much the same time Islamic Spain was\nmarked out by its own distinctive style of thinking, which for the\nmost part placed great emphasis on the importance of science and\nphilosophy in the Greek\n tradition.[16]\n The earliest important thinker was the Jew,\n Solomon ibn Gabirol\n (1021/2(?)\u20131057/8(?)), heavily influenced by Platonism, but\ninsistent that the universe was produced at God\u2019s will, not by\nnecessary emanation, and that matter is present at every level of\ncreation, even in intellectual creatures.\n\nIbn Tufayl (before 1110\u20131185) is known through\na single work, Hayy ibn Yaqz\u0101n, a philosophical novel,\nwhich tells how Hayy, spontaneously generated on a desert island,\nteaches himself, through observation and rational thought, a system of\nphilosophy that corresponds not only perfectly to Avicenna\u2019s,\nbut also to the inner, spiritual meaning of Islamic teaching.\n\nIbn Rushd (\u201cAverroes\u201d in Latin;\n1126\u201398) was an Islamic judge and legal theorist, servant of the\nharshly anti-Jewish and anti-Christian Almohad regime, and also\nperhaps the most devoted Aristotelian of the Middle Ages. Whereas\nscholars in the Islamic East used Avicenna for studying\nfalsafa, Averroes commented the letter of Aristotle\u2019s\ntext, as the Baghdad Peripatetics had done. He wrote short and\n\u201cMiddle\u201d paraphrase commentaries on almost the entire\nAristotelian corpus, and \u201cGreat\u201d (detailed section by\nsection expositions) on some of the texts. These detailed expositions\nof Aristotle proved invaluable to the Jewish and Christian scholars\nwho read them in translation\n (\u00a71.3.3,\n \u00a71.3.4), although his interpretation of On the Soul in\nhis Great commentary would prove very controversial\n (\u00a73.3)\n (see also entry on\n Ibn Rushd\u2019s natural philosophy)\n .\n\nMoses ben Maimon\n (Maimonides\n in Latin; in Jewish scholarship \u201cRambam\u201d;\n1138\u20131204) was educated in Spain (see entry on\n the influence of Islamic thought on Maimonides)\n but was forced to flee by Almohad policy and settled in Egypt. Like\nAverroes, Maimonides looked back to Aristotle himself and\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, and believed that Aristotle had achieved as\nperfect a science as possible. But how far was that science compatible\nwith Jewish teaching? In his voluminous writings on Jewish law, he\nseems to have been willing to accept Aristotelian demonstration as\nproviding the literal truth. In the Guide of the Perplexed,\nwritten late in his life, Maimonides undertakes a profound\ninvestigation of this\u00a0question of (in)compatibility, ostensibly\narguing against Aristotle\u2019s central contention that the world is\neternal\n (\u00a73.1),\n which, he says, destroys Jewish law. At the beginning of the\nGuide, however, he explains that he will sometimes disguise\nhis meaning, and some scholars believe that, correctly interpreted,\nthe Guide supports the Aristotelian view, whilst others see\nits ultimate conclusions as\n sceptical.[17]\n2.7 University Philosophy\n\nBy about 1200, the Paris schools had become a university, and at much\nthe same time a university developed at Oxford. Universities were\nsplit into Arts Faculties and the higher Faculties of Theology, Law\nand\n Medicine.[18]\n Arts Faculties had by far the most students, and those who studied\nthe higher disciplines were older and had usually been trained in the\nArts Faculty or its equivalent. Grammar and logic were studied there\nfrom the beginning, but, as translations of the complete Aristotle\ngradually became available in the course of the thirteenth century,\nafter some decades of ecclesiastical opposition, Arts Faculties became\nin effect Aristotelian Faculties, with the curriculum divided up\naccording to his texts. Although universities were under the aegis of\nthe Church, study in the Arts Faculties was supposed to be limited to\nnatural knowledge, of which Aristotle, a pagan, was considered by\nalmost all to be the supreme representative. Discussion of revealed\ntruth\u2014in a highly argumentative manner, with many purely\nphilosophical digressions\u2014took place in the Theology Faculties,\nwhich quickly came to be dominated by Franciscan and Dominican\nfriars.\n\nIn the mid-thirteenth century, university philosophers were enthused\nby the newly available Aristotelian material, complimented by\nAvicenna\u2019s presentations and understood with the aid of\nAverroes\u2019s\n commentaries.[19]\n The two most famous Parisian Arts masters, Siger of Brabant and\n Boethius of Dacia,\n working in the 1260 and 1270s, tried to develop Aristotelianism\nwithin its own terms, not merely independently of revealed doctrine\n(as they were required to do in the Faculty of Arts), but also\nirrespective of whether it contradicted Christian teaching. The\nDominican theologian\n Thomas Aquinas\n (1225\u201374) was no less enthusiastic an Aristotelian, but he had\nan almost unlimited confidence that Aristotle had reached\ndemonstrative conclusions which must, therefore, be true and, equally,\nbecause true, not be in contradiction with Christian doctrine (though\nChristian doctrine also included elements that could not be known\nexcept through revelation)\n (\u00a73.1,\n \u00a73.3). Siger and Boethius of Dacia were among the targets of a\ncondemnation directed by the Bishop of Paris in 1277 (see entry on the\n Condemnation of 1277)\n against thinkers in the university. Aquinas, recently dead, did not\nescape completely, and he remained a controversial figure, though an\nauthority for Dominicans (see also\n Aquinas\u2019s moral, political, and legal philosophy).\n\nIn the next generation,\n Henry of Ghent\n (d. 1293), a member of the commission that drew up the condemnations,\nwas the most influential Paris theologian. But it was\n John Duns Scotus\n (1265/5\u20131308), an Oxford Franciscan who was then sent to teach\nat Paris, who transformed the subject. He thoroughly absorbed\nAristotelianism, but held that Aristotle\u2019s conception of God was\nwrong, because it did not allow for divine choices\n (\u00a73.2).\n He rejected the Aristotelian conception of modality\n (\u00a73.2),\n stressed divine omnipotence and made divine will the determinant of\ngood and evil. In his metaphysics, he introduced a range of subtle\ndistinctions, vastly complicating the Aristotelian scheme.\n William of Ockham\n (c. 1287\u20131347), a Franciscan theologian who worked at Oxford\nand London before joining the Emperor, Ludwig of Bavaria, in order to\nflee a papal investigation, followed Scotus\u2019s line on\nGod\u2019s will, but substituted for his metaphysics a very sparse\nontology in which the distinctions Scotus had thrust on reality are\nmade through a mental language. Ockham was also a dedicated logician,\nand he and his brilliant Oxford generation made great use of logical\nand linguistic analysis, not unlike Abelard and the twelfth-century\nParis thinkers\n (\u00a74.2).\n In Paris,\n John Buridan\n (d. 1360), the leading Arts Master for decades, and an outstanding\nlogician, followed a similar programme, and, as an Aristotelian\ncommentator, strove to be at once faithful to the pagan texts and yet\nrespect the ultimate truth of Christian doctrine.\n\nAlthough most accounts of Latin university philosophy tail off in the\nmid-fourteenth century, this style of philosophizing continued\nvigorously for at least three centuries\n (\u00a75.2),\n and in this period universities were established all over Europe.\nLate in the fourteenth century, John Wyclif (d. 1384), trained at\nOxford, elaborated a sophisticated and idiosyncratic system of\nphilosophy and theology, aspects of which were taken up by\n Paul of Venice\n (d. 1429), the greatest logician of his time. The Arts Faculties of\nItalian universities flourished especially in the late fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries;\n Pietro Pomponazzi\n (1462\u20131525) was the most famous of these teachers, and the most\naudacious in defending the prerogative of Arts Masters to expound the\ngenuine thought of Aristotle, whatever its differences from Christian\ndoctrine\n (\u00a73.3).\n This tradition of university philosophy continued for nearly two more\ncenturies, with thinkers like\n Giacomo Zabarella\n (d. 1589) in Italy and a host of important figures in Spain and\nPortugal\n (\u00a75.2).\n2.8 Latin Philosophy Outside the Universities (c. 1200\u2013c. 1500)\n\nPhilosophy was also done in the medieval Latin world outside the\nuniversities, although historians are only just beginning to recognize\n it.[20]\n Indeed, some of the most famous and widely studied vernacular\nliterary masterpieces of the period are also works of philosophy. The\nmost obvious example is Dante\u2019s Divina Commedia, a\nstudy in Italian verse of love and moral conduct through an allegory\nof humans\u2019 post mortem destiny. Although without a university\neducation,\n Dante\n (who also wrote a highly original Latin treatise on politics) engages\nwith the great thirteenth-century thinkers\u2014Aquinas and his\nteacher, Albert the Great and, especially, the Arts Masters\u2014on\nequal terms and as an original thinker (Imbach 1996; De Libera,\nBrenet, & Rosier-Catach 2019).\n\nDante was working in a tradition that went back to Boethius\u2019s\nConsolation of Philosophy, a philosophical discussion using\npersonification and an elaborate prose and verse literary form. The\nConsolation was translated into almost every European\nvernacular; its influence mixed with that of twelfth-century Latin\nworks that looked back to it, such as Bernardus Silvestris\u2019s\nCosmographia (based also on the Timaeus) and Alain\nof Lille\u2019s Complaint of Nature. The first of the\nvernacular philosophical poems to draw on this heritage was the\ncontinuation in the 1270s of the Roman de la Rose by Jean de\nMeun, a lawyer who had close connections with the University of Paris\n(Morton & Nievergelt 2020). With both the Roman and the\nCommedia in mind, the late fourteenth-century English writers\nChaucer and Langland wrote philosophical poetry (Troilus and\nCriseyde, Piers Plowman) (Coleman 1981).\n\nMoreover, some highly educated philosophers writing mainly in Latin\nworked outside the universities.\n Ramon Llull\n (1232\u20131315/16) wrote prolifically in Catalan as well as Latin\nand reportedly also in Arabic, devising his own logical system,\nunrelated to university logic, for thinking about God and his\nattributes and demonstrating the truth of Christianity. In the\nfifteenth century, non-university philosophers included the Cardinal\nand papal diplomat\n Nicholas of Cusa\n (1401\u201364), courtier and papal secretary\n Lorenzo Valla\n (1407\u201357),\n Marsilio Ficino\n (1433\u201399), prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Medici in Florence, and\nthe nobleman\n Pico della Mirandola\n (1463\u201394). They all developed their ideas in forms different\nfrom those common in the universities and held classical antiquity in\nhigh regard; Ficino was a noted Platonist\n (\u00a71.3.2),\n Pico aimed to find wisdom in every available source, from the Kabbala\nto \u2026 university\n theology.[21]\n\nWomen were excluded from most forms of higher education in the Middle\nAges, but there were opportunities, none the less, for them to study\nand engage in certain forms of philosophy. Some of those described as\n\u201cmystics\u201d (such as Hildegard of Bingen, Margaret Porete,\nMechthild of Magdeburg and others) engaged with philosophical\n issues.[22]\n And there was Christine de Pizan (1364\u2013c. 1430), a married\nwoman, educated by her father, astrologer to the King of France, who\nsupported her family by writing French poetry when her husband died.\nHer writing, at first lyrical verse, became philosophical, with\nBoethius but also Aquinas as points of reference, informed by a strong\nconsciousness both of the restrictions placed on women and of their\ncapabilities (K\u00f6nig-Pralong 2012).\n2.9 Jewish Philosophy in Christian Europe\n\nAlthough distinctively Jewish philosophy in the Islamic world, written\nin Arabic, died out after Maimonides, it began to flourish, in Hebrew\nand using Hebrew translations of Arabic texts\n (\u00a71.3.4),\n in the Jewish communities of Christian Europe, especially those in\nSpain, southern France and\n Italy.[23]\n The central texts were Maimonides\u2019s Guide and\nAverroes\u2019s commentaries, especially his Middle ones, which\nJewish thinkers often used in preference to Aristotle\u2019s own\ntexts and on which some wrote super-commentaries.\n\nAs explained\n (\u00a72.6),\n Maimonides left it open how his Guide should be interpreted.\nWhile some Jewish thinkers in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\nthought that, even on a literal interpretation, his book conceded too\nmuch to philosophical ideas, a number of them, such as\n Samuel ibn Tibbon\n (d. 1232), responsible for one of the Hebrew translations, favoured\nan esoteric reading, which made the book more radically Aristotelian.\nMoses of Narbonne (d. after 1362) also read the Guide in this\nway and accepts most of Averroes\u2019s views, including the idea\nthat philosophy teaches the complete truth and religion provides a\nmetaphorical version of it, suitable to be understood by ordinary\npeople.\n\nLevi ben Gershom\n (1288\u20131344; \u201cGersonides\u201d) was also a keen reader of\nMaimonides and Averroes, but tried to reach his own view on the most\ndebated questions, after reviewing the arguments on all sides; and, in\nhis masterpiece, The Wars of the Lord, he also explains how\nhis conclusions, based on argument, do in fact accord with the Torah.\nHis views on divine prescience\n (\u00a73.2)\n and the immortality of the soul\n (\u00a73.3)\n are particularly striking examples of his wish to follow a\nphilosophical position through to its ultimate consequences.\n\nThe Wars of Lord competes with Light of the Lord, by\n Hasdai Crescas\n (c. 1340\u20131410/11) as the most profound and adventurous medieval\nHebrew philosophical treatise. Crescas too developed a bold theory\nabout divine prescience, completely opposed to Gersonides\u2019s\n (\u00a73.2).\n Crescas considered himself an upholder of Jewish orthodoxy in\nopposition to Aristotelianism and found powerful arguments to\nchallenge many of the fundamental tenets of Aristotelian science: he\nargued for the existence of a vacuum, the plurality of worlds, time\nwithout bodies and common laws governing sublunar and superlunar\nworlds.\n\nJewish thinkers were influenced not only by their own and the Arabic\ntraditions. Gersonides may well, informally, have come to know about\nproblems and techniques of Christian University Philosophy (Sirat,\nKlein-Braslavy, & Weijers 2003). Latin works were translated into\nHebrew, and in the fifteenth century some Jewish thinkers, such as\nAbraham Bibago (d. before 1489) and Judah Messer Leon (d. 1498) had\nread widely in Latin philosophy (Zonta 2006), whilst\n Elijah Delmedigo\n (d. 1493) wrote in both Latin and Hebrew, mixed in Paduan university\ncircles and translated for Pico della Mirandola.\n2.10 Post-Classical Arabic Philosophy\n\n\u201cPost-classical\u201d is the telling epithet used by\nspecialists to denote Arabic philosophy after Avicenna, apart from\nthat in twelfth-century\n Spain.[24]\n It represents the mass of material that has not until recently been\nstudied historically (although it remained a living tradition in some\nplaces even until the twentieth century). It is now exciting frontier\nterritory for research.\n\nBesides the widespread study of logic\n (\u00a74.1),\n four factors shape philosophizing in this period: Avicenna,\nkal\u0101m, Sufism and al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, whose thinking\nalready combined the first three. Avicenna\u2019s encyclopaedias\nalmost completely replaced Aristotle\u2019s texts as points of\nreference and a commentary tradition on them, especially\nPointers, continued for centuries. New encyclopaedias, on\nAvicennian lines, were written and themselves received commentaries.\nAlthough Avicenna had some faithful followers, the attitude to his\nwork was usually critical. In his Book of What has Been Carefully\nConsidered, Ab\u016b-l-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (born\nc. 1077), a Jew who converted to Islam only at the end of his life,\nsets out his differences from Avicenna on many points. His critical\nstance was taken up in the influential commentary on Pointers\nby Fakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b (c. 1150\u20131210), some of\nwhose attacks were answered in the commentary written by the leading\nthinker of the next generation, the polymathic al-T\u016bs\u012b\n((1201\u201374). Al-R\u0101z\u012b was also a leading\nkal\u0101m theologian: he responded to\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s criticism of falsafa by, it\nseems, teaching two different sets of doctrines,\naccepting\u2014despite his criticisms\u2014many of Avicenna\u2019s\ncentral doctrines\u2014in his commentary, but rejecting them in his\nkal\u0101m writings (Griffel 2021). But, as even\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s own case shows\u2014since he wrote in both\ndisciplines, in the post-classical period the distinctions between\nkal\u0101m and philosophy (no longer usually known by the\nGreek-derived term falsafa but as\nhikma\u2014\u201cwisdom\u201d) were softened. For example,\nthe very influential Book of Stations in Kal\u0101m by\nal-\u012aj\u012b (d. 1355), which was commented on by\nal-Jurj\u0101n\u012b (and that commentary in its turn gathered\nsuper-commentaries), sets out large parts of Avicenna\u2019s\nteaching, although it argues against most of it (Dhanani 2017).\n\nA different stream of reaction to Avicenna is found in the work of\n al-Suhraward\u012b\n (executed in 1191). He accepts Platonic Forms, while rejecting\nAristotle\u2019s view that there are universal forms within\nparticulars: rather, we know real, particular things better directly\nthrough their presence than through discursive reasoning.\nAl-Suhraward\u012b initiated a School of \u201cIlluminationist\u201d\n(ishraq\u012b) philosophers. Sufism was elaborated, with rich\nphilosophical vocabulary and close reference to the philosophical\ntradition, though at a distance from it, by\n Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b\n (1165\u20131240), whose ideas were put into a more systematic form\nby al-Q\u016bnaw\u012b (d. 1273/4).\n\nAll these elements were combined in succeeding years. For instance, in\na famous debate at the beginning of the flowering of philosophy in\nIran, al-Daw\u0101n\u012b (d. 1501) read Avicenna in a manner\ninfluenced by Suhraward\u012b (on whom he commented) and Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u012b; whereas his critics, the al-Dashtak\u012bs, father\nand son (d. 1498, d. 1542), kept closer to the\n text.[25]\n3. Three Medieval Problems\n\nThe three problems that will be discussed now in more detail\u2014the\neternity of the world; divine omniscience and human freedom; the soul\nand immortality\u2014have been chosen for three reasons. They were\neach considered very important in all the traditions of medieval\nphilosophy. They are, in the form discussed, specifically medieval\n(given the long and broad understanding of the Middle Ages advocated\nhere), although closely linked to philosophical issues discussed\nbefore and since. Moreover\u2014and it is for this reason above all\nthat these three topics and not others were selected\u2014they each\ncast a light on how religious concerns interacted with reasoning and\non the different ways in which this took place within the spheres of\neach of the different religious traditions, and between these\nspheres.\n3.1 The Eternity of the World\n\nFor Aristotle, the universe has no beginning, because every change\nrequires a preceding change. The system of nature has always been as\nit is, and so it will\n continue.[26]\n\nThe Aristotelian eternity of the world (everything apart from God) was\nacceptable to the late ancient Platonists, who held that the\nintelligible world emanates from God, but not to most Jews, Christians\nand Muslims. Their revealed religions hold that the world had a\nbeginning, when it was created by God. Moreover, it seemed to them\nthat God cannot be a creator, if the world is eternal.\n\nJohn Philoponus\n (c. 490\u2013570s), a Monophysite Christian who studied at the still\npagan School of Alexandria, was eager to show, using their own tools,\nthat his masters were wrong about the eternity of the world. According\nto his argument, taken up later in the Middle Ages, the world\u2019s\neternity is incompatible with Aristotle\u2019s own principles.\nAristotle held that there could not be an actual infinity: the\ninfinity of days that precedes today if the world is eternal is merely\npotential. Philoponus claims, however, that, because each day is\ncountable, an eternity of past time would be actually infinite. Since\nthat is impossible, the world must have had a beginning (Philoponus,\nOn Aristotle Physics 3 [1994: 428\u2013430, 467\u2013478]\nand Against Aristotle on the Eternity of the World [1987:\n143\u2013146]; Sorabj 1983: 214\u2013215)\n\nExponents of falsafa from al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b onwards\ntook a different approach. They accepted that the world is eternal,\nalthough they also maintained, in accord with Islamic teaching, that\nGod is its agent and maker. In al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s view\n(Incoherence, third discussion [2000: 55\u201377]), however,\nbecause they accepted the eternity of the world (and for some other\nreasons), they were entitled to use these descriptions only\nmetaphorically. Averroes tried to rebut this accusation, minimizing\nthe difference between his position and that of the theologians\n(Incoherence of the Incoherence, third discussion [1954:\n87\u2013155]). He claims (Decisive Treatise; [2001:\n14\u201315]) that faylasuf and\nkal\u0101m\u00a0theologians agree that there are three sorts\nof things: the bodies that make up the world, which are caused and the\nexistence of which is preceded by time; God, who is uncaused and is\nnot preceded by time; and the world as a whole, which time does not\nprecede (because time does not exist without the motion of bodies),\nbut which is brought into existence by an agent. The only difference\nis that the faylasuf hold that time has been going on\ninfinitely, which the theologians deny.\n\nBy contrast, Maimonides\u2014at least on a literal reading of his\nGuide of the Perplexed\u2014rejects any attempt to reconcile\nthe eternity of the world with the creative role of the Abrahamic God,\nwhich for him involves will and choice. Rather, he denies that\nAristotle had succeeded in demonstrating the eternity of the world and\nclaims even that Aristotle himself accepted he had not done so (II, 15\n[1963: II, 289\u2013293]). He does not, however, like Philoponus, try\nto demonstrate that the world has a beginning, but just provides\nstrong, but non-demonstrative arguments for the position. The\nstrongest of them binds his views here even more tightly with his idea\nof God as a wilful agent. Maimonides argues that his account of\nphysics in the sublunary world, Aristotle\u2019s account of how the\nuniverse derives from the One (Maimonides has in mind the emanation\ntheory developed by al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b) is explanatorily\ninsufficient. The only way he sees that the required explanation can\nbe provided is through God\u2019s will: it happens in this way,\nbecause God so chooses. But God can will and choose, Maimonides\nthinks, only if the world he created has a beginning (II, 19\u201325\n[1963: II, 302\u2013330]).\n\nFor Christians, it was clear Church doctrine that the world has a\nbeginning, and in the thirteenth-century Latin universities some\ntheologians tried to use Philoponian arguments to claim this position\ncould be demonstrated. Like Maimonides, Boethius of Dacia (Boethius of\nDacia [1987]), the leading Arts Master in the 1260s\u201370s, did not\naccept that either these arguments, or those for the eternity of the\nworld, are demonstrative. But he also thought that a practitioner of\nAristotelian natural science (one of the roles of an Arts Master) had\nto go further and actually deny the world has a beginning, because\nnatural science is founded on the principle that every change requires\na preceding change. In order to save Arts Masters from heresy,\nBoethius advocates a limited relativism. When natural scientists state\nthat the world has no beginning, they are saying that the world has no\nbeginning according to the principles of natural science, a\nposition in harmony with the true Christian doctrine, according to\nwhich it does have a beginning.\n\nIn his On the Eternity of the World, Aquinas\u2019s position\nis in some ways similar. He accepts on faith that, in fact, the world\nhad a beginning, but rejects rather contemptuously the Philoponian\narguments used by some of his contemporaries. He wishes, however, to\nargue for a different point: that it could have been the case\nthat the world has always existed and yet \u201cis caused by God\naccording to everything that is in it\u201d. Aquinas sharply\ndistinguishes this position from the view that \u201csomething other\nthan God could have always existed, as if something could exist and\nnot be made by him\u201d\u2014which, he says, not just Christian\nteaching, but the philosophers reject as an \u201cabominable\nerror\u201d. He is right, indeed, that the philosophers\u2014not\nAristotle, but Avicenna and Averroes!\u2014did hold that the world\nwas \u201cmade\u201d by God. But, as al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b pointed\nout, it is very unclear how\u2014within the Aristotelian modal scheme\nAvicenna, Averroes and he all accepted\n (\u00a73.2)\u2014an\n eternal world leaves room for God to make the world in the sense\nAquinas certainly meant: that of willing and choosing it.\n3.2 Divine Omniscience and Human Freedom: The Problem of Prescience\n\nGod, according to almost every late ancient and medieval philosopher,\nwhether pagan, Jew, Christian, or Muslim, is omniscient, and so, they\nbelieved, he knows the\n future.[27]\n But if he already knows my future volitions and actions, how can they\nbe free, since it would seem that I cannot will or act otherwise than\nas he knows I shall? There are ways of formulating this Problem of\nPrescience in which it becomes a pseudo-problem, based on failing to\nsee that the wide scope necessity that necessarily (if God\u2014or\nanyone\u2014knows that p, then p) does not entail\nthe necessity of p. Peter Abelard thought that, by pointing\nout this fallacious reasoning, he had solved the problem. His solution\nwas influential, but it misses what Boethius had noticed, six\ncenturies previously in his Consolation, Book V (Marenbon\n2005: 55\u2013116). There is a genuine problem, because God\ndoes not just know, but foreknows. Boethius sees the argument\nas follows (see entry\n Boethius, \u00a76).\n Future contingent events are ones that may turn out one way or the\nother, but to be known\u2014rather than opined or guessed\nabout\u2014the future must be fixed. For God to know the future, as\nhe does, it must therefore be fixed, and so there are no contingent\nevents. But this, he believes, removes the foundation for morality and\nthe value of prayer. Boethius rejects this unwelcome conclusion by\nappealing to the principle that\n\n\neverything that is perceived is grasped not according to its own force\nbut rather according to the capability of those who perceive it\n(Consolation V, pr. 4.25 [2001: 138])\n\n\na principle that relativises cognition to different types of cognizer.\nOn its basis, he can say that many future events (such as those that\ndepend on the exercise of my will) are in themselves unfixed and\ncontingent, but they are fixed and necessary as known by God. This\ndivine mode of cognition can to some extent be explained by\nGod\u2019s relation to time. He exists in eternity, not time.\nAccording to many interpreters, God is thereby atemporal, but it is\nmore likely that Boethius meant that God has a special relationship to\ntime, by which he intellectually grasps all its fleeting moments at\nonce and so he perceives every moment of time as if it were the\npresent. Just as we can watch a chariot race and know who is in the\nlead, without thereby constraining the competitors, so God knows all\nthings, past, present and future, as if they were present.\n\nAquinas followed Boethius, though with greater understanding of the\nlogical structure of the\n question.[28]\n Scotus, however, took a completely different approach (Lectura I\n39 [1994]). Almost all medieval thinkers accepted that\nGod\u2019s knowledge does not depend on its objects, as human\nknowledge does, but brings them about. Boethius put this problem\naside, but Scotus faces up directly to explaining how, if God brings\nabout all things about by knowing them, anything can be contingent.\nThe incompatibility is avoided, Scotus argues, if and only if God\nhimself wills contingently. But the understanding of necessity most\nthirteenth-century university thinkers took from Aristotle would not\nallow God to will or act contingently. What is necessary, they held,\nis equivalent to what is always the case, and so the will of God, who\nall agreed exists always and never changes, is necessary. Scotus made\nexplicit a different understanding of modality, in which possibility\nand necessity are not reducible to temporal conditions. God\u2019s\nwill is unchanging through all time, but it might have been different.\n(Knuuttila 1993: 139\u2013149; and entry on\n medieval theories of modality).\n\nAvicenna and Averroes, who followed Aristotle in holding that God does\nnot know particulars, but only universals, do not face the Problem of\nPrescience. Rather, both thinkers felt the need to explain how, in\nsome indirectway, God\u2019s knowledge is not strictly limited to\n universals.[29]\n Maimonides tried to reconcile both the tension between\nAristotle\u2019s God and a providential one, and divine prescience\nand contingency, through his radically negative theology, according to\nwhich everything about God\u2019s essence, as opposed to his effects,\nis unknowable for us. \u201cKnow\u201d as applied to God, he\nexplains, is used equivocally from \u201cknow\u201d as we usually\nemploy the word, about humans. We cannot understand what it means for\nGod to know (although we can gain some glimmer of understanding by\nthinking of the special grasp a maker has of what he makes), but we\ncan be sure that he knows everything, including future contingents\n(Maimonides, Guide III, 20 [1963: 480\u2013484]).\n\nGersonides was, understandably, dissatisfied with Maimonides\u2019s\nposition. Maimonides was celebrated for insisting that belief in\nGod\u2019s incorporeality is fundamental to Judaism: anyone who\ndenies it is not a Jew. But if language used about God is really\nequivocal, Gersonides points out, how does Maimonides know that\n\u201cGod is a body\u201d is false? (Wars III.3 [1987:\n107\u2013115]). Gersonides himself is willing, not unlike Avicenna\nand Averroes, to restrict God\u2019s knowledge to the general\noutlines of how the world is ordered, but he holds that the precise\ndetails of humans\u2019 lives, though not the rest of nature, are\ndetermined by him indirectly, through the stars. He escapes the\ndeterminism that this might imply, however, by allowing for an\nexception. Humans have the power, by using their intellects, to change\nwhat is astrally determined for them. Suppose it is astrally\ndetermined that I spend this evening partying, I am none the less able\nto grasp intellectually that it would be better to devote it to\nreading Gersonides and, despite the stars, stay at home with The\nWars of the Lord (Wars III, 3\u20134 [1987:\n107\u2013131]).\n\nBy contrast, Crescas firmly held that God foreknows the particular\nevents of people\u2019s lives, and that these are causally\ndetermined, ultimately by God. He accepts the deterministic\nconsequences of this view, because, like compatibilists today, he does\nnot think them inconsistent with human striving to achieve ends and\nbeing punished for misdeeds. He distinguishes between what an agent\ndoes because of its nature and what it does because it is causally\ndetermined (the latter, he says,\u00a0is possible in itself, but\nnecessary through another). If humans became rich as part of their\nnature, then their efforts to make money would be in vain. But, given\nthat this is not the case, the fact that their efforts are causally\nnecessary does not make them futile: on the contrary, they belong to\nthe chain of causes that results in becoming rich. Similarly,\nalthough, if I desist in the future from committing some crime it will\nbe causally necessary that I do so, the punishment laid down for it is\nvaluable because it (through its deterrent effect) is part of that\ncausal\n chain.[30]\n3.3 The Soul and Immortality\n\nPlato thought of human souls as distinct substances from their bodies,\ncapable of existing separately and being reincarnated. The late\nancient Platonists retained this dualism and aimed so far as possible\neven in their mortal lives to release their souls from their bodies\nand find union with the One. By contrast, for Aristotle the soul is\nthe form of a living body, that which accounts for its life functions,\njust as the form of a non-living thing\u2014the form of stoneness in\na stone\u2014accounts for its being the sort of thing it is. A plant,\nthen, grows and goes through its life cycle in virtue of its\nvegetative soul. A non-human animal\u2019s soul is not just\nvegetative but also sensitive: it accounts for the animal\u2019s\nability to move and to perceive with its senses. The human soul\naccounts for all these capabilities, and it also has intellect: it can\nthink intellectually about universals. If the soul is the form of a\nbody, survival independently of the body would seem impossible in\nprinciple. There are, however, passages in Aristotle\u2019s On\nthe Soul (especially 430a [Chapter 5]) that suggest that the\nintellect is imperishable, but they probably are not intended to refer\nto individual human souls.\n\nBy contrast with both Plato and Aristotle, a core belief for Jews,\nChristians, and Muslims is in a bodily resurrection, which is linked\nto punishment for sins and reward for a good life. Christians also\ndeveloped the doctrine that, in the period between death and the Final\nJudgement, people\u2019s souls survive separately and can be\nrewarded, purged, or consigned to eternal punishment.\n\nAvicenna went against the Islamic doctrine of bodily resurrection and,\nreading Aristotle from a Platonist perspective, argued that each human\nhas an intellect which, unlike the other parts of the soul, is\nimmaterial\u2014if it were not immaterial, he argues, it could not\nperceive universals\u2014and, being immaterial, is immortal (see,\ne.g., the passage from The Salvation translated in Khalidi\n2005: 27\u201358). Averroes, too, was unwilling to accept bodily\nresurrection in any straightforward way, and, in face of\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s criticisms of Avicenna in this regard, he\nfalls back on saying that philosophers uphold resurrection because\nthey hold that the masses should believe this widely-held religious\ndoctrine and so they do not contradict it publicly (Averroes\nIncoherence [1954: 359\u2013363]). Averroes does not,\nhowever, at all follow Avicenna\u2019s Platonizing interpretation of\nAristotle\u2019s views about the soul: in his Great Commentary on\nOn the Soul, he argues that there is, indeed, an imperishable\nintellect, but it is an independently existing immaterial being. It\nneeds humans, however, for thinking to take place, since thinking\nrequires images, which humans process in their corporeal brains. Just\nas the book in front of me makes the visual perception I am having of\nit veridical, so the processed images in our brains of bodily things\nenable the one independent, immaterial intellect to think truly using\n universals.[31]\n\nMaimonides considered that the only genuine pleasures are intellectual\nones, and the type of bodily rewards that were often associated with\nthe Resurrection are not only without value, except as incentives for\nthose who lack wisdom, but also misleading, because we should act in\naccord with God\u2019s law for love of God, not from hope of reward\n(Commentary on Mishnah, Introduction to Sanhedrin\n[translated in \u201cMaimonides on the Jewish Creed\u201d, 1906]).\nHe none the less asserted the Resurrection as part of the Jewish\ncreed, and rejected criticisms that he had ever denied it. As in many\nplaces, his genuine position is open to interpretation.\n\nAvicenna\u2019s interpretation of Aristotle proved very attractive to\nthe earlier thirteenth-century Latin university thinkers, since it\nharmonized with Augustine\u2019s dualistic view of soul and body,\nwhich had predominated until On the Soul became known (see\nHasse 2000). Once it was understood properly, Averroes\u2019s theory\nwas recognized as clearly contrary to Christian teaching, since it\nexcluded individual immortality. But many Arts Masters from the 1260s\nthrough to the sixteenth century continued to champion it as the\ncorrect interpretation of Aristotle and the best theory so far as\nnatural reason is concerned, although wrong, because contradicted by\nrevealed truth. Aquinas, however, castigated Averroes\u2019s theory\nas a misunderstanding of Aristotle, and also as incoherent, since it\nmakes humans into the objects of thought rather than\n thinkers.[32]\n He also rejected Avicenna\u2019s dualist reading, insisting that\neach human has their own intellective soul, which is the form of their\nbody. He then explained the separate survival of the human soul by\narguing that its special activity, thinking intellectually, is one\nthat does not take place in a corporeal organ (as sight takes place in\nthe eyes), and so it is a subsisting thing, independent of the\n body.[33]\n\nThe fiercest medieval criticism of Aquinas\u2019s theory was in\nOn the Immortality of the Soul, published by Pietro\nPomponazzi in 1516. Pomponazzi begins by declaring that he accepts the\nimmortality of the human soul as a truth, known by revelation, and\nthat Aquinas\u2019s argument for its immortality is the best that can\nbe made. He opposes both Averroes\u2019s view and a Platonic dualism,\nwhich Ficino had quite recently revived. But he seems to have just as\nmany objections to Aquinas. In particular, he points out that,\naccording to Aristotle, although intellectual thinking is immaterial,\nit cannot take place without there going on at the same time a play of\nmental images, which are sensible things and require a bodily organ,\nthe brain. The human intellect is, therefore, dependent on the body,\nnot in the activity of thinking itself, but with respect to a\nnecessary condition for it. Some historians think that, given the\nstrength of his attack, and the fact that he goes on to explain why a\nrejection of the soul\u2019s immortality need not have bad moral\nconsequences, Pomponazzi did not really accept Christian teaching\nabout the afterlife. It is more plausible, however, that he\u2014like\nBoethius of Dacia in the thirteenth century\u2014was mainly concerned\nto protect the prerogative of Arts Masters to interpret Aristotle and\nwork within natural reason, even when that meant contradicting Church\ndoctrine.\n4. The Importance of Logic\n\nIn the Ancient World, sophisticated systems of logic were developed by\nAristotle and by the Stoics, but, unlike rhetoric, logic was never a\nstandard part of education\n then.[34]\n By contrast, in both the Islamic world and in Latin Europe during the\nMiddle Ages logic became a fundamental discipline, not just within\nphilosophy (as it has been for the last century in the Anglophone\nworld), but for anyone receiving more than the most basic\neducation.\n4.1 Arabic Logic\n\nBy the early tenth century, the whole of Aristotle\u2019s\nOrganon was available in Arabic. It was an extended\nOrganon, which included the Rhetoric and the\nPoetics. Logic was seen as providing the rules for different\nsorts of discourse, of varying levels of intellectual value. At the\nbottom were poetic syllogisms, then rhetoric, then the dialectical\nsyllogisms of the Topics and finally, as the peculiar\npreserve of philosophers, demonstration, the theory set out in the\nPrior Analytics and applied to knowledge in the Posterior\nAnalytics and, so it was thought, according to which Aristotle\nconstructed his entire system of thought. Avicenna did not reject this\noverall view, but he was mainly interested in refashioning\nAristotle\u2019s (demonstrative) syllogistic, even more thoroughly\nthan he reshaped his metaphysics and natural science. He combined\ncategorical and hypothetical syllogistic into a single theory, and he\nvastly complicated Aristotle\u2019s system by introducing temporal\nqualifications into every sort of syllogism (see entry on\n Ibn Sina\u2019s logic).\n Except in Islamic Spain, Avicenna\u2019s logic replaced\nAristotle\u2019s.\n\nFalsafa, however, always remained the pursuit of a small\nminority, at the edges of the world of Islamic education. The position\nof logic was transformed by al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b. Whereas his attitude\nto falsafa was ambiguous, he declared that logic\u2014he had\nin mind Avicenna\u2019s version of Aristotelian syllogistic\u2014was\nuseful, even essential, for the Islamic sciences, such as law, that\noccupied much of the curriculum in the madrasas, which were beginning\nto flourish in his time. Following his lead, logic became a fixed part\nof madrasa education. In the thirteenth century, succinct logical\ntextbooks were written, such as al-Abhar\u012b\u2019s\n\u012as\u0101gh\u016bj\u012b and al-K\u0101tib\u012b\u2019s\nShamsiyya, which were then the subject of many commentaries.\nThe concerns of madrasa logic were formal: developing further\nAvicenna\u2019s path in syllogistic, especially modal syllogistic,\nrelational syllogisms and the Liar Paradox. This tradition was\ncontinued in Iran, Turkey and India, each of these regions\nincreasingly separated from the others, down to the nineteenth\ncentury. (See the entry on\n Arabic and Islamic philosophy of language and logic.)[35]\n4.2 Latin Logic\n\nIn the Latin world, the pattern of education established from c. 800\nin monasteries and cathedral schools\n (\u00a72.2)\n gave logic a central role, in what was the mainstream of higher\neducation, despite very limited access to the ancient\n sources.[36]\n\nAlthough the sophisticated philosophy developed in this context by\nthinkers like Abelard was the preserve of the elite twelfth-century\nParis schools, it had by then become normal for everyone being trained\nintellectually in Latin Europe to learn at least basic Aristotelian\nlogic and the theory of topical inference, as developed in later\nantiquity and transmitted by Boethius. With the founding of the\nuniversities and the expansion of the syllabus to include the whole\nrange of disciplines covered by Aristotle, it might seem that logic\nlost its preeminent position. But it had not, for two reasons. First,\nthe early years of the Arts course were almost entirely devoted to\nlogic, and many students did not remain at university any longer;\nmoreover, they would often have received some instruction in logic\nbefore coming (in their early teens) to university, and there was\nfurther study of logic in the higher faculties of Law and Medicine\n(see Brumberg 2021: 95\u201397). Second, while the influx of new\ntexts made many of the leading thirteenth-century university thinkers\nmore interested in metaphysics, natural science, epistemology and\nethics than in logic, the Oxford thinkers of the 1320s\u2014not just\nOckham, but his fellow Franciscans\n Walter Chatton\n (d. 1343/4) and\n Adam Wodeham\n (d. 1358) and the Dominican\n Robert Holcot/Holkot\n (d. 1349)\u2014made frequent use of sophisticated logical techniques\nin their theological discussions, setting a fashion that would also be\nimitated in Paris (see Courtenay 1987: 171\u2013306).\n\nIn the Arabic tradition, Aristotelian logic was at first studied by\nclose reading of Aristotle\u2019s own texts, but Avicenna then\nreplaced Aristotle as the authority, and then often later textbooks\nreplaced his work\n (\u00a71.1).\n Almost the reverse process took place in the Latin world. From\nconsisting mainly of encyclopaedic accounts, the logical syllabus\nmoved to being constituted of a couple of Aristotle\u2019s works,\nsupplemented by Porphyry and Boethius (the logica vetus) by\nthe eleventh century, and once the rest of the Organon (the\nlogica nova) became available, by the early thirteenth\ncentury, Aristotle\u2019s logic (augmented just by Porphry\u2019s\nIntroduction and a twelfth-century text supplementing the\nCategories) was studied in detail in the universities,\ncontinuing to the sixteenth century, and even later in Spain. This\ntradition of\u00a0commentary, although never abandoning\nAristotle\u2019s text, often resulted in sorting out the difficulties\nin his presentation and reworking his logic (as, for example, in the\ncommentary on the Prior Analytics by\n Robert Kilwardby\n from the 1240s: see Thom\n 2019).[37]\n\nFrom the late twelfth century there also developed in the Latin\ntradition what was called the logica modernorum\n(\u201ccontemporary logic\u201d)\u2014a variety of new branches of\nthe subject not found in Aristotle. The most important of them concern\nthe properties of terms (the analysis of the reference of\nwords\u2014their \u201csupposition\u201d\u2014within the context\nof sentences (see entry on\n Medieval theories: properties of terms);\n consequentiae (propositional logic, by contrast with\nAristotelian term logic\u2014see entry on\n medieval theories of consequence);\n sophismata (deliberately ambiguous sentences and/or ones with\napparently puzzling consequences that can be explained by semantic\nanalysis, such as \u201cSomething white will be black\u201d);\n insolubles\n (insolubilia\u2014paradoxes, such as that of the Liar); and\n obligations\n (an argument game, involving counterfactual statements and testing\nthe contestants\u2019 ability to remain consistent). Specialized\ntreatises were written on each of these topics, but the most popular\ntextbook of all, the Treatise, known as the Summule\nlogicales, written by\n Peter of Spain\n probably c. 1125\u201350, which combines the logica vetus\nand nova with a long exposition of the theory of the property\nof terms. Peter (whoever he was: see Peter of Spain\nSummaries,\u00a01\u20139) was not in fact an outstanding\nlogician, but his work, by then the standard textbook, was adapted,\nwith enormous licence, in the mid-fourteenth century as a vehicle for\nhis also very widely-read Summule de dialectica, by the\ngreatest logician of the time, John Buridan. Work within the\nlogica modernorum went on until the mid-sixteenth\n century.[38]\n4.3 Logic in Byzantium and among the Jews\n\nAlthough logic did not have the same prominent place in Byzantine\neducation as in the Latin schools and universities, or in the\nmadrasas, there was a continuous tradition of its study, based on\nexegesis of the Organon and strongly influenced by the late\nancient School of\n Alexandria.[39]\n\nThere were no outstanding logicians among the Jews in the Islamicate\nworld, but in Christian Europe from the thirteenth century onwards a\nlively tradition of logic grew up. It was based initially on Hebrew\ntranslations of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s short commentaries\nand Averroes\u2019s middle commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nOrganon and the logical part of al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s\nOpinions. But Jewish scholars also became familiar with some\nLatin material, such as Peter of Spain\u2019s Treatise\n(especially the parts on the logica vetus). Gersonides was an\noriginal logician, who wrote widely-studied supercommentaries on\nAverroes\u2019s middle commentaries, where he is often critical of\nAverroes, and a treatise, the Book of the Correct Syllogism,\nremarkable for its degree of formalization (see Manekin 2012).\n5. When Was Medieval Philosophy?\n\nWhereas specialists are mostly agreed, in theory at least, about the\nnew, broad conception of the geography of medieval philosophy, opinion\nabout the period\u2019s chronology remains divided. There is, indeed,\na widespread view (e.g., De Rijk 1985: 1\u201364; Luscombe 1997: 1;\nFlasch 1986 [2000: 27\u201329]; Lagerlund 2020: v) that period\ndivisions are unimportant and are chosen for purely practical reasons\nin order to allow for a division of labour. But, as will emerge below,\nthe choice of period divisions makes a great difference to how the\nhistory of philosophy is written, and arguments can be made from the\ncontinuity and breaks in traditions for different periodizations\n(Marenbon 2011).\n5.1 When Did Medieval Philosophy Begin?\n\nThere are three main points commonly chosen for the beginning of\nmedieval philosophy:\n\nc. 500, a date often chosen by historians for the start of the\nMiddle Ages and corresponding roughly to the end of the Roman Empire\nin the West (the last Emperor was deposed in 476);\nwith the earliest Christian philosophers in the second century\n(but usually omitting the pagan Greek tradition; or\naround 800, because this was the time of both the philosophical\nstirrings at Charlemagne\u2019s court and the start of\nfalsafa in\n Baghdad.[40]\n\n\nThere are problems with each view:\n\nThe justification for c. 500 applies only to Latin philosophy,\nand\nthat for the second century only to Christian philosophy;\nwhile\nignores Greek philosophy and also threatens to leave Latin\nphilosophy between 500 and 800, which historians of classical\nphilosophy disdain, outside consideration.\n\n\nIf the medieval tradition is being envisaged in all four of its main\nbranches, there is some virtue in seeing the point of departure in the\nwork of Plotinus (d. 270) and Porphyry (d. 305?) and including too the\nother Greek pagan material. All four branches are rooted in the\nso-called Platonic Schools, and they took their orientation from these\ntwo philosophers. Of course, historians of ancient philosophy will\nalso want to include some of the thinkers in the earliest centuries of\nthis period in their field, but that is not a problem, because there\nis no reason why periods in the history of philosophy should not\noverlap.\n5.2 When Did Medieval Philosophy End?\n\nMany different answers might be given to this question, but a\nplausible (and to many people surprising) one is: around about 1700,\nexcept that the Arabic tradition, in logic especially, lasted rather\nlonger.\n\nThe Arabic tradition continued, especially in Persia, Turkey and India\nthrough the seventeenth century and, especially in logic (see\n \u00a74.1),\n beyond. The outstanding centre was Safavid Iran, where \u1e62adr\nal-Din Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b (known as\n Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101,\n 1571\u20131636) developed an original system of thought on the basis\nof Avicennian Aristotelianism itself, and as modified by\nSuhraward\u012b, and the mystical ideas of Ibn \u2018Arabi. New\nresearch shows that in the seventeenth century the Ottoman Empire,\ntoo, was the home to innovative philosophizing, sometimes taking the\nearlier Iranian tradition as its starting point (El-Rouayheb\n2015).\n\nThe tradition of Jewish philosophy in Hebrew in Christian Europe\nlargely came to an end with the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in\n1492, though it continued for another century in Turkey (see\nTirosh-Samuelson 1997: 529\u2013545). But Jewish philosophy in Europe\ncontinued with the Dialogues of Love by\n Judah Abrabanel,\n known as Leone Ebreo (d. after 1521), preserved and probably written\nin Italian. If, as proposed below, the Latin tradition of medieval\nphilosophy is considered to stretch on until around 1700, then perhaps\n Spinoza\n (1632\u201377), who wrote in Latin and, rarely, in Dutch, an outcast\nfrom his people and a critical admirer of Descartes, but also steeped\nin the thought of Maimonides and \u1e24asdai Crescas, should be\nregarded as the last of the medieval Jewish philosophers.\n\nThe Byzantine tradition was afflicted by the Fall of Constantinople in\n1453, but theological and philosophical speculation in Greek continued\nunder Turkish rule, strongly linked with the earlier tradition, but\ninfluenced by Latin scholastic thinking in the seventeenth century,\nand by new trends in European thinking in the eighteenth (Podskalsky\n1988).\n\nFixing the end point of the Latin medieval tradition is difficult.\nAlthough the traditional and still widespread date of 1500 is often\ntoday said to have no significance, that year has often been chosen by\ngeneral historians to mark the beginning of modern times, as a round\nfigure near to 1492, the date of Columbus\u2019s first voyage to the\nNew World, and 1517, the beginning of the Reformation, which would\ndestroy the apparent unity of Catholic Europe. Many medieval\nhistorians now, however, do not wish to place a boundary at this time\nand stress the continuities in economic and social life that lasted\nuntil the Industrial Revolution. In any case, there is no reason why\nperiodizations in the history of philosophy should coincide with those\nin other areas.\n\nIn many multi-part or multi-volume presentations, Medieval Philosophy\nis followed by Renaissance Philosophy and then by (Early) Modern\nPhilosophy, beginning with Descartes. \u201cRenaissance\nphilosophers\u201d are identified as usually working outside the\nuniversities; many of them enthusiasts for Plato and other ancient\nphilosophers, as well as, or instead of, Aristotle; many eager to\nwrite elegant classical Latin and to learn Greek, and to use literary\nforms such as the dialogue. There was indeed a group of such\nphilosophers, but they do not fit into a chronology that places\nRenaissance Philosophy after Medieval Philosophy: the most famous of\nthem are Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola\n (\u00a72.8),\n neither of whom survived until\n 1500.[41]\n\nUniversity philosophy continued in its established patterns, with some\nimportant changes (such as dropping study of the Metaphysics)\nin Protestant countries, until late in the seventeenth century. In the\nIberian peninsula, the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were the\nperiod in which philosophical theology, studied in the established\nuniversity manner, flourished (see entry on the\n School of Salamanca).\n The tradition is continuous with the earlier Parisian one, since its\nfounder, Francisco de Vitoria (1486\u20131546) was a pupil of the\nlast of the great Paris University theologians, the Scot John Major\n(1467\u20131550). Among Vitoria\u2019s well-known successors were\nDomingo de Soto (d. 1560), Luis de Molina (d. 1600)\u2014who held\nthat God has a special knowledge of the choices we shall make, but\nthat he does not control these choices, and\n Francisco Su\u00e1rez\n (b. 1548), one of the deepest and most powerful thinkers in the whole\nLatin tradition. One of the few big differences from earlier medieval\nuniversity thinking was the central importance given to Aquinas\n(although Su\u00e1rez was also influenced by Scotus and Ockham),\nwhose Summa Theologiae was now an object of commentary.\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s death in 1617 (more than twenty years\nafter\u00a0Descartes\u2019s birth) does not mark the end of this\nuniversity tradition, but its development into the adventurous\nthought, striking out in new directions in metaphysics and\nmeta-ethics, of until recently forgotten thinkers such as Pedro\nHurtado de Mendoza (d. 1641), his pupil, Rodrigo de Arriaga (d. 1667)\nand Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz (d. 1682).\n\nThe interest of this \u201cbaroque scholasticism\u201d is now\nbeginning to be recognized (see Novotn\u00fd 2009). At the same\ntime, some of the best scholars in the field have written studies that\ndeliberately cut across the usual medieval to modern philosophy\ndivide, looking at metaphysics from 1274 to 1671 (Pasnau 2011) or\ntheories about emotion from 1270 to 1670 (Perler 2011 [2018]). These\napproaches still tend to accept the standard idea that medieval\nphilosophy ended, and modern philosophy began sometime around 1500 or\nat least before 1600, underlining continuities or pleading for the\nexistence of \u201cmedieval philosophy after the Middle\n Ages\u201d.[42]\n A radical suggestion, however, would be to place the ending of\nmedieval Latin philosophy round about 1700 (allowing, of course, for\nan overlap with early modern philosophy), since it was only by then\nthat the effects of the New Science and Cartesianism had worked their\nway into university education and the Aristotelian tradition was\ndisappearing (although by no means everywhere in\n Europe).[43]",
