    "main_text": "History of Fallacy Theory || Copi\n2.9 Copi\n\nIrving Copi\u2019s Introduction to Logic\u2014an\ninfluential text book from the mid-twentieth century\u2014defines a\nfallacy as \u201ca form of argument that seems to be correct but\nwhich proves, upon examination, not to be so.\u201d (1961, 52) The\nterm \u2018correct\u2019 is sufficiently broad to allow for both\ndeductive invalidity, inductive weakness, as well as some other kinds\nof argument failure. Of the eighteen informal fallacies Copi\ndiscusses, eleven can be traced back to the Aristotelian tradition,\nand the other seven to the burgeoning post-Lockean ad-fallacy\ntradition.\n\nThe first division in Copi\u2019s classification is between formal\nand informal fallacies. Formal fallacies are invalid inferences which\n\u201cbear a superficial resemblance\u201d to valid forms of\ninference, so these we may think of as deductive fallacies. They\ninclude affirming the consequent, denying the antecedent, the fallacy\nof four terms, undistributed middle, and illicit major. Informal\nfallacies are not characterized as resembling formally valid\narguments; they gain their allure some other way. One division of\ninformal fallacies is the fallacies of relevance which are\n\u201cerrors in reasoning into which we may fall because of\ncarelessness and inattention to our subject matter\u201d (1961, 53).\nThis large class of fallacies includes accident, converse accident,\nfalse cause, petitio principii, complex question,\nignoratio elenchi, ad baculum, ad hominem\nabusive, ad hominem circumstantial, ad ignorantiam,\nad misericordiam, ad populum, and ad\nverecundiam. The other division of informal fallacies is called\nfallacies of ambiguity and it includes equivocation, amphiboly,\naccent, composition and division.\n\nIt seems that Copi took Whately\u2019s category of semi-logical\nfallacies and moved them under a new heading of \u2018informal\nfallacies,\u2019 presumably for the reason that extra-logical\nknowledge is needed to uncover their invalidity. This has the result\nthat the new wide category of informal fallacies is a mixed bag: some\nof them are at bottom logical failures (equivocation, composition,\nad misericordiam) and some are logically correct but\nfrustrate proof (begging the question, ignoratio\n elenchi).[5]\n Copi\u2019s classification, unlike Whately\u2019s which sought to\nmake a distinction on logical grounds, may be seen as based on three\nways that fallacies resemble good arguments: formal fallacies have\ninvalid forms that resemble valid forms, fallacies of ambiguity\nresemble good arguments through the ambiguity of terms, and fallacies\nof relevance exploit psychological (non-logical) associations. Hence,\nwe may think of Copi\u2019s divisions as between logical, semantic\nand psychological fallacies.\n\nCopi\u2019s treatment of the fallacies is a fair overview of the\ntraditional list of fallacies, albeit he did not pretend to do any\nmore than give an introduction to existing fallacy-lore for beginning\nlogic students. Hamblin (1970, ch. 1) criticized Copi\u2019s work,\nalong with that of several others, and gave it the pejorative name,\n\u201cthe standard treatment of fallacies.\u201d His criticisms rang\ntrue with many of his readers, thereby provoking contempt for the\ntraditional treatment of fallacies as well as stimulating research in\nwhat we may call the new, or post-Hamblin, era, of fallacy studies.\nLet us next consider some of these developments.\n",
