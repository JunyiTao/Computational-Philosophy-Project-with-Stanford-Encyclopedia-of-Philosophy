    "main_text": "The Attraction of Pluralism || Appropriate Responses to Value\n2.3 Appropriate Responses to Value\n\nAnother argument for pluralism starts from the observation that there\nare many and diverse appropriate responses to value. Christine Swanton\n(2003, ch. 2) and Elizabeth Anderson (1993) both take this line. As\nSwanton puts it:\n\nAccording to value centered monism, the rightness of moral\nresponsiveness is determined entirely by degree or strength of\nvalue\u2026I shall argue, on the contrary, that just how things are\nto be pursued, nurtured, respected, loved, preserved, protected, and\nso forth may often depend on further general features of those things,\nand their relations to other things, particularly the moral agent.\n(Swanton 2003, p. 41).\n\n\nThe crucial thought is that there are various bases of moral\nresponsiveness, and these bases are irreducibly plural. A monist could\nargue that there are different appropriate responses to value, but the\nmonist would have to explain why there are different appropriate\nresponses to the same value. Swanton\u2019s point is that the only\nexplanation the monist has is that different degrees of value merit\ndifferent responses. According to Swanton, this does not capture what\nis really going on when we appropriately honor or respect a value\nrather than promoting it. Anderson and Swanton both argue that the\ncomplexity of our responses to value can only be explained by a\npluralistic theory.\n\nElizabeth Anderson argues that it is a mistake to understand moral\ngoods on the maximising model. She uses the example of parental love\n(Anderson 1997, p. 98). Parents should not see their love for their\nchildren as being directed towards an \u201caggregate child\ncollective\u201d. Such a view would entail that trade offs were\npossible, that one child could be sacrificed for another. On\nAnderson\u2019s view we can make rational choices between conflicting\nvalues without ranking values: \u201c\u2026choices concerning those\ngoods or their continued existence do not generally require that we\nrank their values on a common scale and choose the more valuable good;\nthey require that we give each good its due\u201d (Anderson 1997, p.\n104).\n",
