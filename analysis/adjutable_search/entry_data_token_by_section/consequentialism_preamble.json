    "main_text": "\n\nConsequentialism, as its name suggests, is simply the view that\nnormative properties depend only on consequences. This historically\nimportant and still popular theory embodies the basic intuition that\nwhat is best or right is whatever makes the world best in the future,\nbecause we cannot change the past, so worrying about the past is no\nmore useful than crying over spilled milk. This general approach can\nbe applied at different levels to different normative properties of\ndifferent kinds of things, but the most prominent example is probably\nconsequentialism about the moral rightness of acts, which holds that\nwhether an act is morally right depends only on the consequences of\nthat act or of something related to that act, such as the motive\nbehind the act or a general rule requiring acts of the same kind.\n",
