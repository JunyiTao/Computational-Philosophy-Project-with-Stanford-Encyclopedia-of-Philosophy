    "main_text": "Esotericism Revisited\n6. Esotericism Revisited\n\nWe are now in a position to reconsider Strauss\u2019s claims about\nesotericism. In a 1936 essay on the political science of Maimonides\nand Farabi, Strauss returns to the meaning of prophecy for Maimonides.\nWhile most interpreters, including Strauss in Spinoza\u2019s\nCritique of Religion and in parts but not all of Philosophy\nand Law, viewed Maimonides\u2019 conception of prophecy in\nepistemological terms, Strauss argues that Maimonides\u2019\ninnovation was to think of prophecy in political terms. According to\nStrauss, \u201cMaimonides neither wished nor was able, nor had any\nneed, to lift the veil which conceals the origins of the Torah, the\nfoundation of the perfect nation\u201d (RPSMF, pp. 15\u201316). Yet,\nStrauss maintains, the attentive reader will notice that Maimonides\ndistinguishes between Moses, the lawgiver, and all other prophets.\nMaimonides stresses Moses\u2019 exalted status, argues Strauss,\nbecause for Maimonides Moses is the Platonic philosopher-legislator.\nThe emphasis on the uniqueness of Moses as the ideal prophet and ideal\nruler is the core of Maimonides\u2019 political philosophy because\n\u201cNot the mystery of its [the Torah\u2019s] origin, the search\nfor which leads either to theosophy or \u2018Epicureanism,\u2019 but\nits end, the comprehension of which guarantees obedience to the Torah,\nis accessible to human reason\u201d (RPSMF, p. 16).\n\nObedience to the law and the philosophical meaning of the law are two\ndifferent matters that are reflected in what Strauss argues is\nMaimonides\u2019 dual conception of law. The exterior, literal\nmeaning of the law serves to sustain the political community in which\ncertain forms of behavior and belief are required, while the ideal\nmeaning of the law is a matter of philosophical speculation only for\nthose who are capable of such speculation. This dual conception of law\nparallels the dual character of Maimonides\u2019 writing, which\noffers what Strauss calls a \u201cmoderate\u201d reading meant for\nthe masses and what he calls a \u201cradical\u201d reading meant for\nthe philosophical reader. As Strauss would elaborate just two years\nlater in greater detail, this dialectical tension lies at the heart of\nMaimonides\u2019 style of writing and argumentation.\n\nAccording to Strauss, Maimonides is able to properly balance the\nrelation between praxis, obedience to the law, and theory, the mystery\nof the law\u2019s origins, not by conflating them but by keeping them\nin continual dialectical tension. For Strauss, Maimonides\u2019\nrefusal to resolve the tension between law and philosophy (between\npraxis and theory) expresses Maimonides\u2019 moderate claims both\nfor what philosophy can produce on its own (it cannot produce the law)\nand for what revelation can claim to know absolutely (it cannot\nprovide certain knowledge of the mystery of its origin).\nStrauss\u2019s attention to esotericism is rooted in a philosophical\ninterest in \u201ca golden mean which is neither a compromise nor a\nsynthesis, which is hence not based on the two opposed positions, but\nwhich suppresses them both, uproots them by a prior, more profound\nquestion, by raising a fundamental problem, the work of a truly\ncritical philosophy\u201d (RPSMF, p. 4).\n\nFor Strauss, the work of a truly critical philosophy is to grasp\nproblems, and not to provide solutions. What is the absolute problem\nat the heart of esotericism, according to Strauss? The problem\nconcerns the self-sufficiency of reason or, put another way, the\ninescapable and necessary tension between theory and practice. The\ntheological-political predicament of modernity stems from the modern\ncommitment to the self-sufficiency of reason that, Strauss argues,\nresults in reason\u2019s self-destruction. Esotericism is a means\ntoward preserving the limits of philosophy and revelation (or law)\nvis-\u00e0-vis one another. The law comes up against its own\nlimitations in the quest to articulate the philosophical foundations\nof the law. But at the same time, philosophy comes up against its own\nlimits in recognizing that the philosopher is always already within\nsociety (or the law) and for this reason dependent upon the law.\nStrauss thus makes the seemingly immoral move of revealing\nMaimonides\u2019 art of writing for the sake of saving the\npossibility of both revelation and philosophy.\n",
