    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind || Constitutive Rationality\n4.4 Constitutive Rationality\n\nThe contents of a mental state are, according to Lewis, the contents\nthat best make sense of the state. As he sometimes puts it, they are\nthe contents that \u2018fit\u2019 the state. Part of what it is to\nfit a state is to rationalise the behavior that the state typically\ncauses. So constraints of rationality, especially concerning what\nactions are rational given that one is in a mental state, are\npartially constitutive of mental content.\n\nPut this broadly, Lewis\u2019s position is indebted to Donald\nDavidson\u2019s work, and Lewis frequently acknowledges the debt. But\nLewis differs from Davidson in several respects. I\u2019ll briefly\nmention four of them here, then look at two substantial changes in the\nnext two sections. (The primary sources for the discussion in this\nsection are \u201cRadical Interpretation\u201d (1974c) and\nespecially its appendices in Philosophical Papers: Volume I\n(1983a), and \u201cReduction of Mind\u201d.)\n\nFirst, Lewis does not think that fit requires that one\u2019s beliefs\nare typically true. Rather, it requires that beliefs are (typically)\nrational. If the subject is surrounded by misleading evidence, false\nbeliefs fit better than true ones.\n\nSecond, Lewis does not give a particularly special place to the\nsubject\u2019s verbal behaviour in considering which content fits. In\nparticular, we don\u2019t first ask what assignment of contents to\ntheir words best makes sense of their verbal behavior, and then say\nthat the central aspect of fit for mental states involves dispositions\nto produce words with the same contents as belief states. Rather,\nLewis follows Grice (among others) in taking mental content to be\nmetaphysically primary, and linguistic content to be determined by\nmental states (see the section on meaning in the entry on\n Grice).\n\nThird, Lewis believes in\n narrow content.\n Indeed, there is a sense in which he thinks narrow content is\nprimary. He holds that\n Swampman\n has contentful states, thereby disagreeing with Davidson (among\nothers). And he thinks that we share many beliefs (most clearly\nmetalinguistic beliefs) with denizens of\n Twin Earth.\n\nFinally, Lewis\u2019s theory of mental content, like his theory of\nmind in general, is anti-individualistic. What matters is the\nfunctional role that a state typically has in creatures of a certain\nkind, not what role it has in this creature. So there might be a\nmadman who does not attempt to get what they desire. A pure\nfunctionalist may say that such a person has no desires, since\ndesires, by definition, are states that agents attempt to satisfy.\nLewis says that as long as this state typically leads to\nsatisfaction-attempts in creatures of this kind, it is a desire.\nIndeed, if a state typically leads to attempts to get X, it\nis a desire for X, even if little about the role the state\nplays in this particular agent would suggest it is a desire for\nX.\n",
