    "main_text": "Liberal vs Common Good Constitutionalism\n12. Critical Theories\n\nAlthough constitutionalism has been widely embraced round the world,\nit is by no means without its detractors. This is especially true when\nwe turn to those constitutions that not only create and regulate the\noffices of government but also purport to protect abstract rights of\npolitical morality. Some critics\u2014we\u2019ll call these the\nhard critics\u2014assert that such apparently\nrights-protective constitutions cannot effectively and legitimately\nserve to protect individuals against the oppressive forces of\n governments.[20]\n On the contrary, they\nonly serve to shroud legal and political practice in a false cloak of\nlegitimacy. Other critics\u2014we\u2019ll call these the\ndemocratic critics\u2014are not so utterly dismissive of\nrights-protecting constitutions. Rather, their main concern is to\nchallenge the role that democratically unaccountable judges typically\nplay in the interpretation and application of constitutional rights.\nThis concern appears to arise most forcefully in relation to the\ninterpretive theories of Dworkin, the moral judgments of common good\nconstitutionalism and the judicial precedents of living\nconstitutionalists. But the concern is no less acute when we consider\nnew originalism and the ways in which it resorts to the constitutional\nconstructions of judges.\n\nAccording to hard critics, factors like original understandings and\nthe supposed discipline of common law reasoning seldom, if ever,\nsucceed in establishing meaningful limits upon government power. As a\nresult, reliance on such factors in constitutional adjudication only\nserves: (a) to rationalize the purely political decisions of judges\npursuing, consciously or not, their own political ideologies. Further\nconsequences include: (b) a serious affront to democracy. In most\nconstitutional democracies, the judges who ultimately decide\nconstitutional cases are appointed, not elected. That is, they hold\noffice not because they were selected to do so by the democratic\ncommunity, but because of a decision on the part of a President, a\nPrime Minister, a small group of fellow judges, or a judicial\ncommittee of Parliament. Furthermore, these appointed judges tend to\ncome from the privileged classes of society. The end result is a small\ngroup of unelected, elitist judges with the power to substitute their\nown, highly contentious views about the proper limits of government\npower for the considered judgments of the people\u2019s\nrepresentatives, e.g., those members of Congress or Parliament duly\nelected to exercise, on behalf of the people, the latter\u2019s\nsovereign right to participate in political decisions affecting their\nbasic rights. And possibly (c): suppression of those\u2014women,\nminority racial groups, the poor, and so on\u2014whose interests are\nnot adequately recognized and protected by the dominant, mainstream\nideologies to which these elite judges have an affinity. Instead of\nthe curbing of rights-threatening government power for which the idea\nof constitutionalism is supposed to stand, we have political\nsuppression disguised in a cloak of false constitutional\nlegitimacy.\n\nSo hard critics are highly skeptical of constitutional practice and of\nthose theories that applaud constitutionalism as a bulwark against\n oppression.[21]\n As noted at the outset\nof this entry, a key element in the idea of constitutionalism is that\ngovernment can/should be limited in its powers and that its authority\ndepends on observance of those limits. It was further noted that the\nauthority of constitutions in constitutional democracies is generally\nthought to rest with \u2018the people.\u2019 One further claim of\nhard critical theories is: (d) that the concept of \u2018the\npeople\u2019 is very much a fabrication. Instead of being composed of\na group of individuals united in their concern for basic rights,\nwestern societies are comprised of various groups competing either for\ndomination (e.g., white males and the wealthy) or for recognition and\nthe elimination of oppression (e.g., the poor, women, and racial\nminorities). The law, including constitutional law, is a powerful tool\nwhich has, historically, been utilized by dominant groups to secure\nand maintain their superior status.\n\nA particularly vivid example of this last consequence is arguably\nfound in Lochner v New York, a notorious case in which the\nUnited States Supreme Court ruled that a New York State law requiring\nthat bakery employees work no more than ten hours per day and sixty\nhours per week violated the Fourteenth Amendment, which asserts that\nno State may \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\nwithout due process of\n law.\u201d.[22]\n The Fourteenth\nAmendment, the Court held, entails \u2018the right and liberty of the\nindividual to contract\u2019 for a longer work week. The\nLochner decision gave rise to what is commonly called\n\u2018the Lochner era,\u2019 a period stretching roughly\nfrom 1905 till 1937 in which the Supreme Court struck down numerous\nFederal and State statutes aimed at improving the working conditions\nof employees. As such, it may well have been a period during which the\nUnited States Constitution, in the hands of an elitist Court, served\nonly to legitimize overt political suppression. According to hard\ncritics, the Lochner era is but one small piece of a much\nlarger picture.\n\nTo sum up, according to hard critics, a constitution is anything but\nthe protection from unwarranted government power that its champions\nhave heralded over the centuries. What is taken to be the obvious\nmeaning of a key term like \u2018equal before the law\u2019 is what\nthe dominant group understands or claims it to be. What is taken to be\nthe obvious original understandings or historical intentions of the\nconstitution\u2019s authors are whatever understandings or intentions\nfit the ideologies of the dominant groups. What is taken to be the\nbest articulation of the right to equality emerging from a fair and\ndisciplined common-law analysis of that right, from a Dworkinian\ninterpretive theory, or from an articulation of the common good is\nnothing but a rationalization of current social structures, all of\nwhich systematically oppress the interests of women, minorities and\nthe poor.\n\nAs noted above, democratic critics tend not to be as utterly\ndismissive of constitutions and constitutional rights protections as\ntheir more hard-line cousins. Their principal objections revolve\naround a practice with which these aspects of modern constitutional\nregimes are typically associated: judicial or constitutional\nreview. This is the practice whereby courts are sometimes called\nupon to review a law or some other official act of government (e.g.,\nthe decision of an administrative agency like the US Food and Drug\nAdministration or the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications\nCommission) to determine its compatibility with the\n constitution.[23]\n Particular instances of\nthis practice vary considerably. As noted above, in some\njurisdictions, such as the United States, judicial review includes the\npower to \u2018strike down\u2019 or nullify a law duly passed by a\nlegislature body or administrative body and the decision is final and\nirreversible. In other jurisdictions, the courts either do not have\nthe power to strike down or nullify, or a decision to do so is\nreversible by some other body of government. As we saw, courts in the\nUnited Kingdom do not have the power to invalidate Parliament\u2019s\nlegislation, that is, declare it void and of no force and effect. But\nthey do have the authority, under section 4 of the Human Rights Act\n1998, officially to declare legislation incompatible with The\nHuman Rights Act. Upon such a declaration, Parliament usually\nundertakes to amend or repeal the offending legislation. But should it\nchose not to do so, the legislation remains valid and the courts have\nno further legal recourse. In Canada, the Supreme Court has the power\nto strike down a law which it believes unjustifiably infringes a right\nguaranteed in Sections 2 or 7\u201315 of The Canadian Charter of\nRights and Freedoms, but Section 33 of that same Charter\ngrants Parliament or the legislature of a province the power to\noverride that decision. This co-called \u2018notwithstanding\nclause\u2019 allows Parliament or a provincial legislature to declare\nthat, notwithstanding its unjustifiable infringement of an enumerated\nright, the offending legislation will stand as constitutionally valid.\nInsofar as these two versions of weak-form review leave the final\ndecision regarding the meaning and scope of a constitutional right and\nthe limits it imposes on government powers in the hands of the\nlegislature, it is touted by its defenders as consistent with\ndemocratic principle. According to critics of weak-form review,\nhowever, the practice strips the constitution of one of its most vital\nfunctions: the protection of individual and minority rights against\nwhat Mill, following de Tocqueville, famously called \u2018the\ntyranny of the\n majority.\u2019[24]\n\n\nAmong the most influential of contemporary democratic critics is\nJeremy Waldron. Waldron is, to put it mildly, no fan of constitutional\nreview. Nor is he enamored of the grandiose constitutional charters\nand bills of rights which serve as the most contentious ground in\nterms of which that power is often exercised by courts. According to\nWaldron and his fellow democratic critics, constitutional review under\nan entrenched charter or bill of rights is fraught with both\ntheoretical and practical difficulty. It threatens democracy and is\nboth fundamentally unfair and politically dangerous. It also relies on\noutmoded views about the nature of moral rights\u2014that there are\nobjective, universal rights of political morality to which charters or\nbills of rights make reference, upon which there is widespread\nagreement within democratic communities, and to which judges can\nsensibly and justifiably be asked to appeal in protecting citizens\nagainst recalcitrant exercises of government power. While it is true\nthat constitutional review need not be based on an appeal to abstract\nrights of political morality (it could, for example, be restricted to\nquestions such as whether Congress or a provincial legislature has\nfollowed proper procedure) and true that it need not include the\nability actually to strike down legislation, the main focus of\ndemocratic critics has been on strong-form constitutional review which\nexemplifies these two features.\n\nAccording to democratic critics it is difficult to underestimate the\nconsiderable power which constitutional review under an entrenched\ncharter or bill of rights places in the hands of judges who are, in\nmodern constitutional democracies, typically unelected and hence not\ndirectly accountable to the democratic community. Despite their lack\nof accountability, these judges are assigned the task of providing\nauthoritative answers to the deeply controversial questions of\npolitical morality that arise under constitutional review and with\nrespect to which there is so much deep disagreement. Examples can\nrange from the permissibility of abortion or physician-assisted\nsuicide, to the banning of hate speech or the publication of violent\nand degrading pornography on the internet. On the basis of these highly\ncontroversial answers they end up determining what shall be deemed\nlawful in the community. This is far too much political power for a\nsmall group of unelected people to wield over an entire democratic\ncommunity, no matter how learned and wise they might happen to be. But\nperhaps more importantly, the granting of such power is fundamentally\nundemocratic in principle: individual citizens have, in effect, been\ndisenfranchised by this arrangement. Each citizen of voting age should\nhave an equal right, in a democratic society, to contribute to the\ncreation of the laws by which she is governed. This she exercises\ndirectly via the ballot box and by whatever contributions to public\ndiscourse and debate about controversial issues she chooses to make.\nShe also does so indirectly via the legislative votes of her elected\nrepresentatives, whose task is to represent her interests and\nopinions. Yet with strong-form constitutional review all this has been\nreplaced by subjection to the pronouncements of judges. The duly\nconsidered views of citizens and their representatives about the laws\nby which they are to be governed, arrived at (it is hoped) through\nfair processes of democratic decision-making, have, in effect, been\nset aside in favour of the contentious moral pronouncements of a\nhandful of democratically unaccountable, elite judges. This unhappy\nsituation is further exacerbated by the undeniable fact that judges on\nappeal courts often disagree vehemently among themselves about rights\nof political morality and must often, in the end, rely on majority\nvoting to settle their own disagreements. It is not at all uncommon to\nsee split votes when a court deals with a contentious issue of moral\nprinciple like affirmative action, abortion or pornography. And often\nthese split votes follow patterns which are closely correlated with\nthe all too discernible political leanings of\n judges.[25]\n  Add to this the fact\nthat judges render decisions which all too often appear to conflict\nnot only with views widely shared in the community at large, but also\nwith their own previous decisions in earlier cases, and what might\nseem like a marvelous idea in the abstract\u2014constitutionally\nguaranteeing moral rights and fundamental interests against the abuse\nof government power\u2014is transformed into a living nightmare. A\nnightmare in which democracy, fairness and the rule of law have, in\neffect, been abandoned and replaced by the rule of a few men and\nwomen, by a kind of \u2018judicial oligarchy.\u2019 And no matter\nthe high esteem in which we tend to hold our judges in modern\nconstitutional democracies, this is not a form of government to be\neagerly embraced.\n\nCritical theories, both hard and democratic, represent a serious\nchallenge not only to conventional theories and established practices\nof constitutional interpretation, but to the very idea of\nconstitutionalism itself\u2014the idea that government can and should\nbe limited in ways that serve to protect us from unwarranted state\npower. According to originalism, the constitution protects us from\njudges and other officials by restricting them (largely) to\npolitically and morally uncontroversial, neutral decisions about\nhistorical intentions and understandings. According to one strand of\nliving constitutionalism, our evolving constitution can do the same\nwhile at the same time allowing the constitution to grow and adapt to\nchanging circumstances and (it is hoped) better moral understandings.\nIt can effect this balancing act so long as the judges, in whom the\npower of constitutional interpretation and enforcement has largely\nbeen placed, are willing to subject their deliberations to the\ndiscipline of common law reasoning. Critics, however, remain highly\nskeptical. Ordinary judges are not, critical theorists will insist,\nPlatonic kings and queens, dispensing justice in the light of\nobjective moral truth. We must always remember, critics insist, that\nour judges are ordinary, flawed human beings with all the intellectual\nand moral shortcomings, weaknesses and biases of their fellow human\nbeings. They are also, more often than not, members of a dominant\ngroup (e.g., wealthy, white males) who share the social background,\neducation, perspective, and moral values of that group. But if\nconstitutions are all at the mercy of dominant ideologies and the\nwhims and convictions of elite judges, then the kind of protections\nheralded by the idea of constitutionalism may be a myth, and a harmful\none at that.\n\nSo what is the solution according to critical theorists? The proffered\nsolutions can vary considerably, depending on how hard-line the\ntheorist tends to be. A theocrat might advocate the complete overthrow\nof constitutional, democratic government, while a liberal feminist\ncritic might be content to work within existing constitutional systems\nto eradicate the vestiges of patriarchy which have survived recent\nfeminist movements (MacKinnon, 1989; Strossen 1995). Waldron and his\nfellow democratic critics ague that we should abandon the practice of\nconstitutional review of legislation under entrenched charters or\nbills of rights and leave political decisions where they belong: the\npeople and their elected and accountable representatives (Waldron,\n1992, 2006; Marmor, 2007). Yet another avenue of response is to\nhighlight the extent to which the critics\u2019 most powerful\nobjections apply only to strong-form review, where judicial decisions\nare final and can have the effect of nullifying the efforts of\ndemocratically accounted legislatures. Having pointed this out, the\nnext move is to recommend weaker forms of review which arguably\nreflect a healthier balance between respect for fundamental rights, on\nthe one hand, and the importance of democratic procedure on the other\n(Gardbaum, 2013). Were an effective version of something like\nCanada\u2019s Section 33 override included within a constitution, the\ncourts might well be able to maintain their intended role as defenders\nof rights, while leaving the final word to the legislature in cases\nwhere intractable differences of opinion run\n deep.\n\nIn recent years another solution has been offered by populism.\nAlthough often seen as antithetical to constitutionalism (M\u00fcller\n2016) because of its perceived tendency towards totalitarianism,\npopulism could instead be viewed as a reaction to a specific form of\nconstitutionalism and the type of constitutional practice to which it\nlends itself (Vergara 2020). Thus understood, populism targets\nconstitutional constraints that take political power away from the\npeople and place it in the hands of elites, most notably the judges\nwho decide constitutional cases but also, to some extent, elected\nrepresentatives. Conversely, it favors constitutional arrangements\nthat allow for or encourage broad public participation and\ndeliberation in respect of controversial issues of political morality,\nespecially with a view to empowering and engaging in the political\nprocess the marginalised and excluded segments of society (Gargarella\n2022). Although this solution is animated by egalitarianism, just like\nWaldron and other democratic critics, it insists that it is not enough\nto point to the legislature \u2013even a reasonably well formed\none\u2013 as the forum that vindicates political equality. Indeed, we\nmay have to look beyond traditional institutional forms to\nreinvigorate the polity.\n\nWhatever the preferred solution, all critics of constitutionalism seem\nto agree that progress can be made only if the myths surrounding\nconstitutional protection\u2014the constraining force of original\nunderstanding, intention, history, the discipline of common law, and\nso on\u2014 are all exposed, and that the true political forces at\nwork in constitutional practice are acknowledged and dealt with\nopenly. Whether the idea of constitutionalism can survive the lessons\nof such critical scrutiny is a very good question.\n",
