    "main_text": "Introduction || Background: Sport, Culture, and Philosophical Thinking\n1.1 Background: Sport, Culture, and Philosophical Thinking\n\n\nHuman communities have engaged in sport for reasons as diverse as\namusement, religious worship and political stability (Baker, 1988).\nAncient Sumerians and Egyptians practised sport to prepare themselves\nfor war. So too did ancient Greeks and Romans, for whom sport also had\nimportant religious and social signification. For instance, in\nClassical Greece, athletic contests (gymnikoi agones)\nprovided an arena for the cultivation and demonstration of excellence\n(arete). This pursuit of excellence through sport played a\nmajor role in Hellenistic culture, where striving for perfection in\nbody and mind served as one of the society\u2019s principal unifying\nactivities (Lunt & Dyreson, 2014). Likewise, in the Mayan\ncivilization, ballgames served religious, social, and political\npurposes such as providing a common bond while downplaying differences\nand conflict arising from local diversity (Fox, 2012).\n\n\nPhilosophers have reflected on the nature of sport at least since\nAncient Greece. Plato and Aristotle viewed sport as a key component of\neducation and, by extension, human flourishing (Reid, 2011,\n26\u201380). An educated Greek must find harmony between body and\nmind by, among other things, engaging in athletic contests. Reflection\non the role sports play in human life and culture continued during\nRoman times and the medieval era. In Rome, sports were understood\ninstrumentally as tools to train warriors. For instance, the fifth\nbook of Virgil\u2019s Aeneid is devoted to the celebration of\ncontests of speed and strength with an emphasis on preparing Romans\nfor war. In medieval times, despite losing relevance in the public\nsphere, sport played a significant role in Christian imagery (Reid,\n2011, 81\u2013106). For example, in City of God, Augustine\n(14.9) referred to the apostle Paul as \u2018the athlete of\nChrist\u2019. Thomas Aquinas, like Plato and Aristotle, advocated for\nthe need to cultivate body and soul to flourish as human beings\n(Kretchmar et al., 2017, 93\u2013120). \n\n\nIn early modernity, sport regained prominence in public life, not\nleast on account of its potential to cultivate human excellence and\npromote the good life. Renaissance schoolmasters included sport in\ntheir curricula. Even Protestant thinkers, often thought to have been\nopposed to leisurely activities such as sports, embraced the practice\nof athletic activities for formative purposes (Reid, 2012). Martin\nLuther and John Milton advocated for the utilization of sport\nactivities to educate individuals and train Christian soldiers\n(Overman, 2011). During the Enlightenment, drawing on the empiricists\u2019\nemphasis on the cultivation of bodily capacities to achieve accurate\nsensory data, Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued for the need to exercise and\ndevelop body and mind harmoniously (Andrieu, 2014). Rousseau\u2019s\npedagogical theory, along with several others, was implemented in the\n19th-century Victorian England and Germany, where sports were valued as\ncharacter-building activities. Inspired by these pedagogical\nphilosophies, Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the Olympic Movement,\nregarding Olympic sport as a \u2018philosophy of life which places\nsport at the service of humanity\u2019 (IOC 2019; see also McFee 2012;\nParry 2006).\n\n\nIn contemporary society, sport plays a central role in the lives of\ncountless players, coaches, officials, and spectators. The teaching of\nsport is part of national school curricula, sports news forms part of\nour national media, and sport has been deployed as a public policy\nmeasure to address everything from anti-social behaviour to obesity.\nHowever, despite the role sport has played throughout human history,\nthe philosophy of sport as an academic sub-discipline did not develop\nuntil the middle of the 20th century. We recount some of the\nfield\u2019s history now.\n",
