    "main_text": "The Theory of Divinity\n6. The Theory of Divinity\n\n\nThe central discussion in the theory of divinity in Sefer\nha-\u2018Ikkarim is located in the second treatise, which is dedicated\nto the principle of the existence of God and its derivative roots. The\nphilosophical issue at the focal point of this discussion is the\ntheory of divine attributes. Scholars of Albo\u2019s theory of attributes\nhave discerned an internal contradiction between rationalist and\nconservative positions in his discussion of this topic. On the one\nhand, in a number of locations he purports to support Maimonides\u2019\nnegative theology, and interprets the various attributes of God as\nnegative attributes. On the other hand, elsewhere he relates positive\nattributes to God, in accordance with the method of his teacher,\nCrescas. Some scholars have ascribed this contradiction to the\neclectic character of Albo\u2019s work (Wolfson 1916\u201317,\n213\u2013216; Guttmann 1955, 184\u2013191), while others have\nrelated it to the esoteric style of writing of Sefer\nha-\u2018Ikkarim.  Possibly, they suggest, his goal here was to\nconceal his conservative position on this issue from the circles of\nrationalist thinkers he frequented (Schwartz 2002, 187\u2013196;\nEhrlich 2009a, 88\u201393).\n\n\nThe second treatise of the book raises another important philosophical\nproblem, the significance of the concept of time. One of the roots of\nthe principle of the existence of God is God\u2019s independence of\ntime. In Albo\u2019s discussion of this root, he discriminates between two\ndifferent concepts of time, Aristotelian-physical and\nNeoplatonic-ontological. Two central trends appear in the academic\nliterature on this topic. The first places the concept of time at the\nfocus of the discussion, attempting to clarify the relationship\nbetween the two different concepts of time that appear in Albo\u2019s\ndiscussion (Harvey 1979\u201380). Those scholars who take the second\nposition discuss Albo\u2019s concept of time as part of their attempt to\nidentify his cosmogonic view, in other words, which theory of the\norigin of the world he upholds (Klein-Braslavi 1976, 118\u2013120,\n126; Rudavsky 1997, 470\u2013473). In this context, we should point\nout that comprehensive study of Albo\u2019s writing on this issue reveals a\ncertain difficulty in categorizing his exact position.  Together with\nexplicit dogmatic statements supporting the theory of creation ex\nnihilo appearing in the first treatise, we find other statements,\nalthough less overt, some of which argue for the eternal existence of\nmatter, and some of which even support the eternal existence of the\nworld (Ehrlich 2009a, 94\u2013112).\n",
