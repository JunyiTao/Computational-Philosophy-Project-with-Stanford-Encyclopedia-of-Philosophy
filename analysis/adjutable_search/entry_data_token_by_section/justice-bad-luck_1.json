    "main_text": "Distributive Justice\n2. Distributive Justice\n\nIt is commonplace to distinguish between retributive justice and\ndistributive justice. In both cases the issue of bad luck arises, and\noffhand it seems that the role one ascribes to luck in one area will\nconstrain the role one can ascribe to luck elsewhere: if luck raises\nquestions about the significance of desert in the sphere of\ndistributive justice, it will probably have similar repercussions\nvis-a-vis desert and retributive justice (Sandel 1982, 91\u201392;\nScheffler 1992, 306). In the present entry, however, we shall focus on\nrelations between luck and distributive justice.\n\nIn fact it will be useful to narrow the focus further to a particular\nfamily of theories of distributive justice\u2014namely, those\ninvolving an end-result principle of justice (Nozick 1974,\n153\u2013155). End-result principles entail that one can judge\nwhether a certain distribution of goods is desirable without knowing\nhow it came about. The following are well-known principles of this\nkind and/or theories giving a central role to them. (a) Crude\negalitarianism, given which it is bad or unjust if some people are\nworse off than others. (b) Crude sufficientarianism, given which it is\nbad or unjust if some people do not have enough of whatever is the\nrelevant currency of distributive justice (Frankfurt 1988,\n134\u2013158; see also Axelsen and Nielsen 2015; Casal 2007; Huseby\n2010; Shields 2012, 2016). (c) Prioritarianism, given which we should\nmaximize the sum of welfare that is weighted to ensure that benefits\nat lower levels of welfare have more weight than those at higher\nlevels (Holtug 2010, 202\u2013243; Adler and Holtug 2019). (d) The\ndifference principle, given which it is unjust if the worst off are\nless well off than they could be. (Strictly speaking, Rawls himself\nsays that the difference principle applies to the basic structure of\nsociety (Scheffler 2006, 102\u2013110; compare Cohen 2000,\n134\u2013147; Cohen 2008, 116\u2013180), so for Rawls it applies\nonly indirectly to outcomes. On this understanding, the difference\nprinciple is not, in any straightforward sense, an end-state\nprinciple. Here we prefer to treat the difference principle as one\nthat applies directly to outcomes.) Finally, there is (e)\nutilitarianism, given which we should maximize the sum of welfare.\n\nThere are two reasons for narrowing the focus in this way. First, some\nend-result principles have been defended on the basis of\nconsiderations about luck. Thus it is often suggested that\nconsiderations about neutralizing luck favor the difference principle\nover \u2018historical\u2019 principles of justice, i.e., principles\ndefining justice in terms of the way a distribution of goods comes\nabout. No such suggestion has been made on behalf of non-end-result\nprinciples. Take Nozick\u2019s entitlement view. On this view, it may\nbe a matter of luck what people are entitled to, and yet Nozick\nexplicitly claims that this does not erode the relevant entitlements\n(Nozick 1974, 225). Second, many have inserted into end-result\nprinciples clauses that allow for deviations from the prescribed\nend-result provided that these deviations do not reflect luck. For\ninstance, most contemporary egalitarians believe that an unequal\ndistribution that is not a matter of bad luck for the worse off could\nbe just. Luck plays no comparable role in historical principles. The\nimportant conceptual point is that, as Arneson puts it, we should\ndistinguish the \u201cluckist\u201d element in a theory of\ndistributive justice from the end-result favored by the theory, when\nsetting aside \u201cluckist\u201d concerns (Arneson 2006;\nLippert-Rasmussen 2018; for different views on how these two\ncomponents (do not) cohere, see Miller 2015; Elford 2017).\n\nJohn Rawls\u2019 work explains why the concept of luck has had a\ncentral place in discussions of justice over the last 40 years. In an\nimmensely influential section of his A Theory of Justice he\nintroduced the metaphors of the social and natural lotteries (for a\nbrief overview over Rawls\u2019 appeal to luck and the legacy of this\nappeal, see Knight and Stemplowska 2011, 2\u20139). The underlying\nidea is that every person\u2019s starting point in society is the\noutcome of a social lottery (the political, social, and economic\ncircumstances into which each person is born) and a natural lottery\n(the biological potentials each person is born with). Rawls says that\nthe outcome of each of person\u2019s social and natural lottery is,\nlike the outcomes of ordinary lotteries, a matter of good or bad\n\u201cfortune\u201d or \u201cluck\u201d (Rawls 1971, 74, 75).\nHence, since one cannot possibly merit, or deserve, an outcome of this\nkind, people\u2019s starting positions cannot be justified by appeal\nto merit or desert (Rawls 1971, 7, 104). It can be seen, then, that\nRawls\u2019 social and natural lotteries provide negative support for\nhis theory of justice. They undermine alternative theories in which\ndistributions of social and economic benefits deviating from that\nprescribed by the difference principle are tolerated (Nozick 1974,\n216; Arneson 2001, 76). They also underpin Rawls\u2019 claim that a\nsystem of natural liberty\u2014one in which formal equality of\nopportunity obtains in that \u201call have at least the same legal\nrights to all advantaged social positions\u201d (Rawls 1971, 72) and\napplicants are assessed on their merits alone\u2014is unjust because\n\u201cit permits distributive shares to be improperly influenced\nby\u201d the outcomes of the social and natural lottery.\n\nLuck also plays an important positive role in Rawls\u2019 work. Since\nwe can regard people\u2019s natural talents as a matter of luck, it\nis appropriate, Rawls thinks, to regard their distribution as a\n\u201ccommon asset and to share in the benefits of this distribution\nwhatever it turns out to be.\u201d This means that \u201c[t]hose who\nhave been favored by nature\u2026. may gain from their good fortune\nonly on terms that improve the situation of those who have lost\nout\u201d (Rawls 1971, 101 \u2013 this point is put somewhat less\nstrongly in the second edition of A Theory of Justice). This\nis exactly what the difference principle, in one of its versions,\nsays.  Moreover, if we assume an independently plausible principle of\nredress which says that \u201cundeserved inequalities\u2026 are to\nbe compensated for\u201d, and if people\u2019s lives are shaped by\nundeserved outcomes of the social and the natural lottery, then we can\nsay that the difference principle \u201cdoes achieve some of the\nintent of the [principle of redress]\u201d (Rawls 1971, 101). (While\nit is undeniable that luck plays a role in A Theory of\nJustice, and that the considerations described above are\ncongenial to luck-egalitarians, some commentators argue that this role\nis exaggerated and misconceived when Rawls is understood in\nluck-egalitarian fashion (Scheffler 2003, 8\u201312, 24\u201331;\nScheffler 2005; Scheffler 2006; Freeman 2007, 111\u2013142; Mandle\n2009, 24\u201329; Forst 2020). In Section 8, we ask whether the\nluck-neutralizing aim can play a positive role in justifying equality,\nan issue that is, of course, distinct from the question whether it has\nbeen widely thought to be capable of playing such a role.)\n\nLuck has been examined closely in the writings of successive\negalitarians (Arneson 1989; Arneson 2011; Cohen 2008; Cohen 2011;\nDworkin 2000; Nagel 1991; Rakowski 1991; Roemer 1993; Roemer 1996;\nRoemer 1998; Temkin 1993). (While the philosophers mentioned here are\noften referred to as \u201cluck egalitarians\u201d, not all of them\nfavor this label (e.g., Dworkin 2003, 192; cp. Arneson 2018)). Ronald\nDworkin holds that differences in wealth generated by differences\n\u201ctraceable to genetic luck\u201d (Dworkin 2000, 92) are unfair.\nHe describes a hypothetical insurance device which, on the one hand,\nneutralizes \u201cthe effects of differential talents\u201d (Dworkin\n2000, 91) and, on the other hand, is insensitive to the different\nambitions people have in their lives (Kymlicka 2002, 75\u201379).\nSimilarly, G. A. Cohen writes that \u201canyone who thinks that\ninitial advantage and inherent capacity are unjust distributors thinks\nso because he believes that they make a person\u2019s fate depend too\nmuch on sheer luck\u201d (Cohen 2011, 30). In his view, \u201cthe\nfundamental distinction for an egalitarian is between choice and luck\nin the shaping of people\u2019s fates\u201d (Cohen 2011, 4).\n\nGenerally speaking, sufficientarians do not incorporate a\n\u201cluckist\u201d element into their views about distributive\njustice (see, however, Casal 2007, 322). A sufficientarian theory that\ndoes so might say, e.g., that it is unjust if some people do not have\nenough through no fault or choice of their own\n(\u201cluck-sufficientarianism\u201d, we might call this view). The\nreason sufficientarians tend not to endorse some such view is that\nthey believe that people are entitled to a certain minimum, however\nthey exercise their responsibility.\n\nLuck is also appealed to by some who believe that benefits matter\nmore, morally speaking, the worse off those to whom the benefits\naccrue are. Thus Richard J. Arneson has defended a version of\nprioritarianism accommodating the \u201cgeneric egalitarian\nintuition\u201d that \u201cfortunate individuals should give up\nresources to improve the life prospects of those whose initial\nconditions are unpropitious [i.e., the upshot of bad luck]\u201d\n(Arneson 1999, 227). According to this view, \u201cthe moral value of\nachieving a gain (avoiding a loss) for a person\u201d is\n\u201cgreater, the lower the person\u2019s lifetime expectation of\nwell-being prior to receipt of the benefit (avoidance of the\nloss)\u201d and \u201cgreater, the larger the degree to which the\nperson deserves this gain (loss avoidance)\u201d (Arneson 1999,\n239\u2013240).\n\nFinally, while no one has argued that utilitarianism is grounded in\nreflections on luck, it has certainly been argued that non-luck\nconsiderations qualify our obligation to maximize welfare.\nFred Feldman, for instance, defends a version of consequentialism that\nadjusts utility for justice on the basis that a pleasure is more\nvaluable if it is deserved and less valuable, or perhaps even\ndisvaluable, if it is undeserved (Feldman 1997). Given an appropriate\naccount of desert, this position might be looked upon as\nluck-utilitarianism (or luck-consequentialism). On one version of this\nkind of view (one differing from Feldman\u2019s), the moral value of\nan outcome always increases with increasing welfare for individuals.\nBut as is the case with Arneson\u2019s responsibility-sensitive\nprioritarianism, on this view the moral value of an extra unit of\nwelfare to a person is \u201cgreater, the larger the degree to which\nthe person deserves this gain (loss avoidance).\u201d\n",
