    "main_text": "Natural Selection Accounts || Indirect\n4.1 Indirect\n\nThe primary motivation for the earliest indirect, cybernetic accounts\nof biological teleology were to explain the apparent purposiveness of\nbiological organisms, for instance, the maintenance of constant body\ntemperature in endotherms. These accounts aimed to provide a\nnaturalized explanation for the goal-directed behavior of biological\nsystems through reference to their organization. In an influential\nearly paper, Norbert Wiener and colleagues sought to explain the\ngoal-directed behavior of biological organisms and machines as arising\nfrom their utilization of negative feedback mechanisms (Rosenblueth et\nal. 1943; for further development see also Braithwaite (1953),\nSommerhoff (1950) and Nagel (1953)). Attributions of teleological, or\ngoal-directed, behavior to animals or machines, they argued, meant\nnothing more than \u201cpurpose controlled by feed-back\u201d (Rosenblueth et al. 1943, 23). \n\nThis cybernetic account of teleology inspired biologist Colin\nPittendrigh to introduce the term \u2018teleonomy\u2019 into the\nliterature (Pittendrigh 1958). With this neologism, Pittendrigh hoped\nto purge biology of any vestiges of Aristotelian final causes whilst\nproviding biology with an acceptable term to describe adapted,\ngoal-directed systems. This term was taken up in the 1960s by\nevolutionary biologists such as Ernst Mayr (1974) and George Williams\n(1966), as well as by scientists studying cell metabolism and\nregulation, who were just beginning to elucidate the structural and\nmolecular basis for cellular feedback mechanisms (Monod & Jacob\n1961; Davis 1961). According to proponents, adopting a cybernetic\naccount of goal-directed behavior in biological systems splits the\nexplanatory problem in two. On the one hand, teleological activity in\nthe biological world could be explained by the presence of teleonomic\nsystems with negative feedback mechanisms, whereas the very presence\nof those teleonomic systems in living organisms, on the other hand,\ncould be explained by the action of natural selection (Monod 1970\n[1971]). \n\nAlthough explicit cybernetic accounts of biological teleology have\nfallen out of favor, other organizational approaches to biological\nfunction have had a recent resurgence in the function literature.\nThese organizational, or systems-theoretic, approaches often build\nupon early cybernetic accounts or aim to extend Maturana and\nVarela\u2019s (1980) influential notion of autopoiesis, which refers\nto the self-organizing, self-maintaining characteristic of living\nsystems (see the entry on\n Embodied Cognition\n for further description). These accounts identify the function of a\nbiological trait through an analysis of the role the trait plays\nwithin an organized system in contributing to both its own persistence\nand the persistence of the system as a whole (Schlosser 1998;\nMcLaughlin 2001; Mossio et al. 2009; Saborido et al. 2011; Moreno\n& Mossio 2015). Although they differ in their details,\norganizational approaches to biological function generally agree that\na trait token T has a function F when the performance of\nF by T contributes to the maintenance of the complex\norganization of the system, which in turn results in T\u2019s\ncontinued existence. For example, the heart has the function to pump\nblood, according to these accounts, because it contributes to the\nmaintenance of the entire organism by causing the blood to circulate,\nwhich facilitates the circulation of oxygen and nutrients. At the\nsame time, this circulation is also responsible in part for the\npersistence of the heart itself, since the heart also benefits\ndirectly from this function (i.e., the cardiac cells receive the\noxygen and nutrients necessary for their survival). \n\nSimilar to direct natural selection accounts, organizational accounts\ncan be forward or backward-looking: the function of a trait may\nidentify its dispositional contribution to the complex organization of\nthe system which results in its own persistence or reproduction in the\nfuture (forward-looking; Schlosser 1998), or a functional attribution\nmay identify a trait\u2019s past contribution (etiological, or\nbackward-looking; McLaughlin 2001). Alvaro Moreno\u2019s group adopts\na third position. They claim their organizational account of function\nunifies these two perspectives (Mossio et al 2009; cf. Artiga &\nMartinez 2016). All these organizational accounts differ from direct\nnatural selection accounts, however, in that they make no appeal to\nthe selection history of the trait. Instead, the function of a trait\ncan be inferred from the present or past role of the trait in\nmaintaining itself within the complex, organized system without\nfurther holding that the trait was selected for that role. On this\nview, functional attributions in biology are explanatory not because\nof selection, but rather because of the causal role traits play in\ncontributing to the maintenance of the organization of a system, which\nin turn enables the traits themselves to persist. \n",
