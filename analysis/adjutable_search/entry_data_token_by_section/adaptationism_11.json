    "main_text": "Are constraint hypotheses genuine rivals to adaptive hypotheses?\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\n\n Why should biologists and philosophers care\nabout the debate over adaptationism? This debate has been and will\ncontinue to be important to biologists because it helps clarify how to\ndo better evolutionary biology. Despite this, a minority of\ncurrently-active biologists contribute to the debate about\nadaptationism, and many ignore it or disparage it. For a variety of\nreasons, many of the important points that have arisen from the debate,\nsuch as how to structure empirical tests of adaptive hypotheses and\noptimality models, go unheeded. For example, claims for local\noptimality continue to appear that lack a specification of even a\nsingle alternative hypothesis to the adaptive hypothesis. This lack\ninevitably leaves ambiguous the status of the adaptive hypothesis. In\naddition, standards for rejection of the (only) adaptive hypothesis\ncontinue to be rarely delineated if at all.\n\n\n The debate over adaptationism will continue\nto be important to philosophers of biology because much will be gained\nby a more informed understanding of the use of hypotheses about natural\nselection by biologists. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a general\ntendency to misunderstand the conceptual commitments of users of\noptimality models. More recently, there has been a growing\nunderstanding of the variety of conceptual commitments held by users of\nsuch models, especially that the use and development of an optimality\nmodel need not bind the user to a blind acceptance of the claim that\nnatural selection is all powerful.\n",
