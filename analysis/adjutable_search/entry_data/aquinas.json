    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n1.1 Life\n\nThomas Aquinas was born near Aquino, halfway between Rome and Naples,\naround the year 1225. He was the youngest of at least nine children,\nand born into a wealthy family that presided over a prominent castle\nin Roccasecca. As a teenage student in Naples, he fell under the sway\nof the Dominicans, a newly founded order of priests devoted to\npreaching and learning. Joining the order at the age of nineteen, he\nwas assigned to Paris for further study, but his plans were delayed by\nthe intransigency of his parents, who had hoped he would play a\nleading role at the venerable local monastery, Monte Cassino, where he\nhad studied as a child. After confining him to Roccasecca for a year,\nhis parents yielded and Thomas went to Paris as a Dominican friar.\n\nThomas spent three years in Paris, studying philosophy, and then was\nsent to Cologne, in 1248, under the supervision of\n Albert the Great.\n This older Dominican proved to be the ideal mentor. Albert was at the\ntime the leading figure in the newly prominent program of melding\nChristian theology with Greek and Arabic philosophy. He possessed an\nencyclopedic grasp of the sciences of the day, which had been\nexpanding at a dizzying pace thanks to the new availability of the\nAristotelian corpus in Latin translation. It was Albert\u2019s firm\nconviction, which became Aquinas\u2019s own, that the Christian faith\ncould only benefit from a profound engagement with philosophy and\nscience.\n\nThomas evidently flourished under Albert\u2019s influence, for when\nAlbert was asked in 1252 to nominate a student to pursue an advanced\ndegree in theology at the University of Paris, he chose Thomas, even\nthough he was still two years younger than the minimum required age.\nAfter four years as a bachelor of theology, lecturing on the Bible and\non Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences, Aquinas received his\ndoctorate and was immediately appointed master of theology, once again\nat an earlier age than the statutes officially allowed. From 1256\nuntil 1259, he held the Dominican chair of theology in Paris,\npreaching, lecturing on the Bible, and presiding over various\nphilosophical and theological disputations.\n\nAlthough some masters at the University of Paris spent decades\nteaching there, it was the custom of the Dominican order (as with the\nFranciscans) to rotate scholars through these positions. Accordingly,\nin 1259 Aquinas was sent back to Italy, where he spent most of the\nfollowing decade in several Dominican houses of study, first in\nOrvieto (in Umbria) and then in Rome. During these years, while he\ncontinued to preach, lecture on the Bible, and conduct academic\ndisputations, he found the time to develop his two most important\nworks, the Summa contra gentiles and the Summa\ntheologiae.\n\nIn 1268, Aquinas was asked to return to Paris for an unusual second\nterm as master of theology. Here he put his now venerable reputation\nto work in attempting to steer the philosophical conversation away\nfrom various extreme positions that were dividing scholars. He wrote a\nbrief treatise arguing for a middle ground on the vexed question of\nwhether the world could be proved to be eternal or created in time\n(\u00a73), and a somewhat longer treatise against the view that all\nhuman beings share a single intellect (\u00a76.2). These years were\ndominated, though, by his efforts to complete the Summa\ntheologiae and at the same time write commentaries on all of\nAristotle\u2019s principal works. When his second four-year term in\nParis came to an end he returned to Italy, this time to Naples, in\n1272. During these final years he nearly, but not quite, finished both\nthe Summa theologiae and his commentary series. Instead,\nafter a year and a half in Naples, he stopped writing, famously\nexplaining that \u201cAll that I have written seems to me like straw\ncompared with what has now been revealed to me.\u201d A few months\nafter that he died, in the Cistercian abbey of Fossanova, on March 7,\n1274.\n\nThis chronology of Aquinas\u2019s life is fairly well attested. There\nare also many colorful stories about his life, many of which stem from\ntestimony given during his canonization inquiry in 1319. The\nauthenticity of these stories is unknowable. Aquinas himself, in his\nwritings, reveals almost nothing about his personal life. (For\nbiography see Porro 2012 [2016]; Torrell 1993 [2022]; Legge 2022.)\n1.2 Works\n\nOver a mere two decades of literary activity, Aquinas left behind more\nthan eight million words (eight times more than has survived, for\ninstance, from Aristotle). It is a measure of Aquinas\u2019s\nimmediate and lasting influence that\u2014quite unlike the situation\nwith other medieval philosophers\u2014essentially everything he wrote\nhas survived and has been lovingly edited and translated into English\nand many other modern languages. In outline, there are five categories\nof works:\n\nencyclopedic theological treatises, such as the Summa\ntheologiae and the Summa contra gentiles;\ndisputed questions, such as the Questions on Truth, often\nmore detailed than his summae;\nbrief works (opuscula), such as On Being and\nEssence;\ncommentaries on Aristotle and on other philosophical texts;\nbiblical commentaries.\n\n\nThe bibliography below contains further details about individual works\nand their chronology.\n\nThe Summa theologiae (ST) generally represents\nAquinas\u2019s most considered thought on a given topic, and the work\nis comprehensive enough that it contains at least some discussion of\nalmost all of Aquinas\u2019s intellectual concerns. It divides into\nfour parts:\n\nthe prima pars (1a): the nature of God and the created\nworld, including human nature;\nthe prima secundae (1a2ae): human action and what shapes\nit (passion, virtue, vice, law, grace);\nthe secunda secundae (2a2ae): the theological and\nphilosophical virtues, in detail;\nthe tertia pars (3a): Christ and the sacraments (complete\nthrough q. 90; his disciples drew on earlier texts to produce a\n\u201csupplement\u201d that brings the work to its intended\nend).\n\n\nThe treatments in ST are deliberately brief. Aquinas writes\nin the preface that \u201cour intent in this work is to develop those\nissues that concern the Christian religion in a way that suits the\neducation of those who are just beginning.\u201d Today, no one thinks\nof ST as a work for beginners, although its scope and\nconcision make it a useful place to start. A serious engagement with\nAquinas\u2019s work, however, requires comparing ST with\nparallel treatments elsewhere, such as the earlier Summa contra\ngentiles (SCG) and the still earlier commentary on\nLombard\u2019s Sentences. Moreover, since all three of these\nlong works are written as theological treatises, it is useful\nalso to compare these discussions with his accounts in the more\nphilosophically focused and often more detailed disputed questions. In\ngeneral, given how much Aquinas wrote and how often he reconsidered\nthe same issue from a slightly different perspective, a careful study\nof his work requires comparing multiple treatments of the same issue.\nAnd since he did not begin to circulate his work until he was 30, and\nlived for only two decades more, those various treatments tend to\nreinforce rather than conflict with each other. (Naturally, scholars\nhave long debated whether his thought evolves on one topic or another,\non which see Pini 2012.)\n\nMost of Aquinas\u2019s central texts are written in the distinctive\nscholastic style of the disputed question, in which the topic to be\ndiscussed is posed at the start as a question. The dispute begins with\na series of arguments on one side. These, however, almost always\nrepresent the opposite of Aquinas\u2019s own position, and so, after\nthe initial arguments, one or more arguments are posed to the contrary\n(sed contra), and then Aquinas makes his own main reply in\nthe body (corpus) of the article, and finally he responds to\nthe initial arguments (ad 1, ad 2, etc.). This structure is\nbased on actual classroom procedures, even if Aquinas\u2019s\ncarefully composed works are never a literal record of an actual\nclassroom debate. It is a method that lends itself to argumentative\nrigor, but often is best digested by reading the text in something\nother than the order in which it appears on the page. (I myself like\nto begin with the main reply.)\n\nAn important exception to the disputed-question format is\nAquinas\u2019s commentaries. These are often extremely useful for\nunderstanding his own philosophical thought. This is true most\nobviously of the philosophical commentaries, which cover most of\nAristotle\u2019s key works. The point holds true, however, for his\nbiblical commentaries as well, because they regularly contain\ninteresting discussions of wide-ranging philosophical topics (Stump\n2010). One has to approach all of Aquinas\u2019s commentaries with\nsome caution, however, because his principal method of commentary is\nto produce a word-by-word paraphrase. This means that, if one does not\nread these works with one eye on the text being commented upon, a\npassage that may seem to represent Aquinas\u2019s thought may instead\nbe a rephrased version of what Aristotle (or Isaiah or Paul) said.\nWhether or not Aquinas\u2019s paraphrase of a passage from Aristotle\nshould be treated as a reflection of Aquinas\u2019s own thought is a\nmatter of some dispute (Jenkins 1996; Elders 2009), but readers should\nat least be aware of how these commentaries are structured. The\npassages most likely to shed light on Aquinas\u2019s own thought are\nthose where he breaks away from his line-by-line paraphrase to offer a\nbrief lecture on some issue germane to a proper understanding of the\nunderlying text.\n\nIt is tempting, for modern readers, to divide Aquinas\u2019s work\ninto the theological and philosophical, but lines here are difficult\nto draw. The medieval university did formally distinguish between the\nhigher-level discipline of theology and the undergraduate arts\nfaculty, whose curriculum consisted largely in the works of Aristotle.\nBut many of the questions of the theologians\u2014such as the\nworkings of intellect, the nature of freedom, the systematization of\nethical theory\u2014are now seen as paradigmatically philosophical.\nAt the same time, much of Aristotle, and therefore much of the arts\nfaculty curriculum, looks to us more scientific than philosophical.\nAquinas, unlike his teacher Albert the Great, only occasionally\ndwelled on what we now think of as scientific questions. Conversely,\nas a professor of theology, he considered at great length various\nmatters that depend on\n divine revelation, such as the\nnature of the Trinity and the character of Christ\u2019s humanity. A\ncomplete understanding of Aquinas\u2019s thought thus requires\nspending considerable time with such properly theological\nquestions. At the same time, it is appropriate today to number Aquinas\namong the philosophers, because he was particularly interested in and\nhad particularly innovative things to say about what we now think of\nas philosophical questions. The tremendous energy he put into\ncommenting on Aristotle\u2019s works is a testimony both to the\nimportance he gives philosophy for a proper understanding of theology,\nand to his confidence that progress in philosophy will only benefit\nthe Christian faith. As he famously wrote, \u201cif anything is found\nin the words of the philosophers that is contrary to the faith, this\nis not philosophy but rather an abuse of philosophy, due to a failure\nof reason\u201d (Comm. Boethius De trinitate 2.3c).  \n\n\nFor book-length general surveys of Aquinas's thought see Stump 2003,\nDavies and Stump 2012, Shields and Pasnau 2016, Stump and White\n2022.\n2. God\n\nAquinas believes that natural reason can demonstratively prove\nGod\u2019s existence. The first step is to show that, for everything\nin the changeable world around us, there is a first cause, or prime\nmover, in virtue of which all other things have their existence, their\nmotion, their qualities and direction. This is the result he gets in\nhis much discussed \u201cfive ways\u201d of proving God\u2019s\nexistence (ST 1a 2.3c). Aquinas denies that Anselm\u2019s\n ontological argument\n has any force as a proof (ST 1a 2.1 ad 2; SCG\nI.10\u201311). Instead, the first three ways are\n cosmological arguments,\n based on the impossibility of an infinite series of causes.\nCommentators generally agree that what Aquinas means to exclude is an\ninfinite series of simultaneous causes, a \u201cvertical\u201d\nseries as opposed to an infinite \u201chorizontal\u201d series of\ncauses going back in time, which he does not think can be proved to be\nimpossible (\u00a73). Each of the five brief arguments ends with a\nvariation on the formula \u201cthis is what everyone calls\nGod.\u201d He puts his claim cautiously at this point, because to\ndemonstrate the existence of a prime mover falls well short of\ndemonstrating the existence of a being worthy of being called God. For\nall we have seen so far, for instance, this first cause might itself\nbe a body. But Aquinas thinks natural reason\u2014what we now call\n natural theology\u2014can\n go well beyond the five ways. ST 1a goes on to establish\nthat this first cause is not a body (3.1), nor composite in any way\nand hence entirely\n simple\n (3.7), perfect in every respect (4.2), the highest good (6.2),\ninfinite (7.1),\n omnipresent\n (8.2), completely unchangeable (9.1), eternal (10.2), supremely one\n(11.4), and possessing\n the most perfect knowledge\n (14.1). These results establish the existence of something worthy of\nbeing called God. (On Aquinas\u2019s natural theology in general see\nKretzmann 1997; Wippel 2000 chs. 10\u201313; Stump 2003 pt. I. On the\nfive ways see Kenny 1969; MacDonald 1991a; Martin 1997; Pawl 2012;\nCohoe 2013.)\n\nThe successes of natural theology, for Aquinas, have their limit. For\nalthough natural reason can establish the existence of a perfect\nbeing, it is incapable of establishing many of the features that\ndistinctively characterize the Christian God, such as God\u2019s\ntriune nature and God\u2019s incarnation as a human being. Here is a\nplace where philosophy alone, unaided by revelation, fails to yield an\nadequate theology. Since the ultimate goal of human life, salvation in\nthe life to come (\u00a78.1), requires some grasp of these Christian\ntruths, \u201cit was necessary for the sake of human salvation that\ncertain truths that surpass human reason be made known to us through\ndivine revelation\u201d (ST 1a 1.1). The study of revealed\ntheology is important, moreover, not only with respect to these\nso-called mysteries of the faith, but also in cases where the results\nof natural reason are too precarious to be counted on. Without direct\naccess through revelation, \u201cthe truth about God investigated by\nreason would be available only to a few people, after a long time, and\nwith the admixture of many errors.\u201d Accordingly, \u201cbeyond\nthe philosophical disciplines investigated by human reason, it was\nnecessary to have a sacred teaching through revelation\u201d (ibid.).\nThis sacred teaching (sacra doctrina) is the work of\ntheology.\n\nOne of the most difficult and most discussed issues in Aquinas\u2019s\nnatural theology is the limits he places on our ability to understand\nGod\u2019s nature. A sign of the difficulties to come emerges just\nafter he sets out his initial five-way proof, when he remarks,\n\nOnce it is grasped that something exists, it remains to be\ninvestigated how it exists, in order that what it is may be\nknown. But because it is not possible for us to know what God\nis, but rather what God is not, we cannot consider\nhow God exists, but rather how God does not exist. (ST 1a\n3pr; see Davies 2018)\n\n\nThat Aquinas in fact honors this constraint is far from obvious, given\nthe seemingly positive claims he makes regarding the divine nature. To\nunderstand his approach one must come to grips with his theory of\n analogical predication.\n In a case like God\u2019s goodness, for instance, Aquinas does not\nmean only to deny God\u2019s badness. It can be truly said, he\nthinks, that God is good. The difficulty is that the word\n\u2018good,\u2019 when truly applied to God, has a different sense\nfrom what it has in cases familiar to our own experience. The two\nsenses are thus not univocal, but nor are they purely equivocal, as if\nGod\u2019s goodness were wholly unrelated to the goodness we\nexperience. Instead, the usages are analogical (ST\n1a 13.5). So, \u201cwhen we say God is good, the sense is not that\nGod is the cause of goodness or that God is not bad; rather, the sense\nis that what we call good in creatures preexists in God, albeit in a\nhigher mode\u201d (ST 1a 13.2c). We can say with confidence,\non the basis of this analysis, that God is good, indeed preeminently\nso. To the extent that we are good, it is so only by participation in\nGod\u2019s goodness. But our cognitive limitations preclude a more\nadequate account of this \u201chigher mode\u201d in which God is\ngood. (On analogy in Aquinas see McInerny 1996; Montagnes 1963 [2004];\nDewan 2007; Ashworth 2014; Hochschild 2019.)\n3. The Created World\n\nThe mainstream of philosophical tradition as Aquinas knew it, running\nfrom Aristotle through the Greek commentators and into the Arabic\ntradition, held that the material world, and all the kinds of living\nthings in it, had always existed. These earlier Aristotelians still\nthought there was a place for God, as the first mover, but they\nunderstood God to be the initial, remote source of motions that had\nalways existed, rather than an eternal being who created the universe\nanew. Aquinas understood Christianity to be committed to the latter\nview. He holds that the changeable universe around us has existed for\nonly a finite amount of time; that God, in contrast, has existed\neternally and unchangingly; and that God freely chose to create the\nchangeable universe from nothing (ex nihilo). To bring a\nthing into existence ex nihilo is the defining feature of\n creation,\n in the strict sense of that term, and only God can do it (ST\n1a 45). Everything else in the natural world causes new things to come\ninto existence by modifying what is here already. The proper\nterminology for these natural changes is generation and\ncorruption, which refer to a substance\u2019s coming into or\ngoing out of existence by natural means, and alteration,\nwhich refers to a substance\u2019s undergoing accidental change:\ncontinuing to exist through change to its shape, color, and other\nnon-essential properties.\n\nAristotle and many of his followers believed they could prove that the\nworld had always existed. Conversely, many of Aquinas\u2019s\ncontemporaries thought they could prove the opposite, that the world\nhad to have a beginning in time, and the debate between these rival\nphilosophical accounts was one of the most acrimonious issues in the\nearly medieval university (Dales 1990). Aquinas took up the question\nin detail in his treatise On the Eternity of the World,\nconcluding that no demonstrative argument is possible either way. For\nall we can tell, God could have created the world in such a way that\nit had always existed. That we think otherwise is another deliverance\nof the faith, not susceptible to philosophical proof. This measured\nconclusion is characteristic of his thought in many domains. On the\none hand, he has complete confidence that philosophical reasoning,\nproperly pursued, will not yield results that are a threat to\nChristianity. On the other hand, he thinks it discredits the faith to\ndefend it through dubious attempts at demonstration. The key is to see\nwhere philosophy can be of service, and where it must give way to\nrevealed doctrine (Wippel 1995c; Kretzmann 1999 ch. 5).\n\nIt is not easy to think about God\u2019s relationship to the created\nworld, because without such a world there can be neither space nor\ntime (ST 1a 46.1, 46.3). Not space, because space is nothing\nmore than the existence of bodies, where bodies are beings that\npossess parts outside of parts, and so constitute the\nthree-dimensional extension that we think of as space. Accordingly,\nwhere there are no bodies there is no space. (Aquinas, following\nAristotle, denies that void space is coherent.) Not time, because\nAquinas accepts Aristotle\u2019s definition of time as the measure of\nmotion. In a world without motion, then, there is no time, which means\nthat the first moment of time was the first moment of the created\nworld. Although it is hard to resist thinking of God as having existed\n\u201cbefore\u201d there was a material universe, God\u2019s mode\nof existence, in a world without bodies, must be an existence outside\nof space and time. This need not entail, however, that God even now\nexists outside of space and time. God\u2019s\n omnipresence\n was commonly understood as a literal presence everywhere (Pasnau 2011\nch. 16), and Aquinas characterizes God\u2019s eternity not as a mode\nof existence outside of time, but as \u201cbeing present to every\ntime or instant of time\u201d (SCG I.66.8). It is, however,\nfar from clear what \u201cpresent\u201d amounts to in such a claim\n(Leftow 1990). These difficulties are of a piece with the general\ndifficulty we have in thinking about God using the concepts familiar\nto us from the world around us.\n\nHowever these metaphysical issues are resolved, it is clear that God\nis constantly, everywhere engaged with the world. Because \u201ca\nthing\u2019s existence cannot remain after the cessation of the\naction of the agent causing the effect\u201d (ST 1a 104.1c),\nthe created world must have not just an initial creative cause but\nalso an ongoing cause that\n conserves\n it from moment to moment. Since God is necessarily perfect, the\ncreated world cannot be beneficial for God, and since a universe with\na perfect being is itself already perfect, God\u2019s goodness does\nnot necessitate his creating anything at all. Moreover, since for\neverything God creates he could create something better (ST\n1a 25.6c), there is no sense to be made of the idea of a best of all\npossible worlds. Accordingly, God is free to create otherwise than he\ndid, and free even not to create anything at all: \u201cSince\nGod\u2019s goodness is perfect, and he can exist without other\nthings, \u2026 it follows that there is no absolute necessity that\nhe will things other than himself\u201d (ST 1a 19.3c).\nStill, creation has a purpose: God \u201cintends only to share his\nperfection, which is his goodness\u201d (ST 1a 44.4c). Among\ncreatures, those beings who possess intellects\u2014angels and human\nbeings\u2014are preeminent, in virtue of their capacity to love and\nunderstand their creator. Accordingly, the rest of creation is\norganized for their sake (SCG III.112). Ultimately, however,\nthe purpose of the created world is to reflect God\u2019s goodness\nand glory: \u201cthe whole universe, with its individual parts, is\nordered to God as its end, inasmuch as, by a kind of imitation, the\nuniverse represents divine goodness for the glory of God\u201d\n(ST 1a 65.2c). So it is that Aquinas takes everything in the\ncreated world to be subject to God\u2019s providential order\n(\u00a77). (For a broad study of Aquinas on creation see Kretzmann\n1999.)\n4. Form and Matter\n\nGiven the preeminence of intellectual beings in the created order, it\nshould be no surprise that most of God\u2019s creative efforts went\ninto their establishment. This is, primarily, the domain of the\nangels, who \u201cexceed in number, incomparably, material\nsubstances\u201d (ST 1a 50.3c). The angels are wholly\nimmaterial beings, which makes them unlike us (\u00a75) and unlike the\ncreated world with which we are directly acquainted, which is a\nmaterial world. So, if we set aside the realm of immaterial\nminds\u2014God, angels, the human soul\u2014we are left with a world\nof material objects, suitable to be understood in terms of an\nAristotelian hylomorphic (matter\u2013form) analysis.\n\nWithin this material domain, a material substratum underlies all\nchange, and real change typically involves the gain or loss of some\nform. This can be made to look straightforward enough when examples\nare carefully chosen. If a tree\u2019s limbs are bent under the\nweight of an early fall snowstorm, then the tree undergoes alteration\n(accidental change) in virtue of taking on a new shape (a new\naccidental form), while the material substance (the tree itself)\nendures. If the storm in fact kills the tree, then the substance is\ncorrupted (a substantial change), in virtue of losing its substantial\nform, which is the internal principle that gives the substance its\nnature. In cases like this, where the substance is destroyed, Aquinas\nadvances a metaphysical claim that is quite surprising: that all that\nendures through the change is the most basic material substratum,\nprime matter, which lacks all form. (Aquinas\u2019s early\nOn the Principles of Nature summarizes the basic story. For\ngeneral discussions of Aquinas\u2019s metaphysics of material bodies\nsee Wippel 2000 chs. 7\u20139, Brower 2014. On causation at the level\nof creatures see Frost 2022.)\n\nThe resulting picture seems to postulate, as the constituents of\nsubstances, three types of basic entities: prime matter, substantial\nforms, and accidental forms. How exactly to understand each of these\nhas been subject to a great deal of discussion over the centuries.\nWith respect to accidental forms, one of the chief puzzles is to\ndefine those cases in which we have a genuine change of form. Aquinas\nclearly thinks, for instance, that colors and other proper sensibles\nare accidental forms. But does he think, as the above example of the\ntree implied, that shapes too are accidental forms? It is not entirely\nclear, and depends on difficult questions about how he understands\nAristotle\u2019s theory of the\n categories\n (Wippel 2000 ch. 7; Pasnau 2011 ch. 12). With respect to substantial\nform there is an analogous problem arising from unclarity over what\nexactly the substances are (Pasnau 2002 ch. 3; Rota 2004; Marmodoro\nand Page 2016). He clearly takes all living things to be substances,\nalthough there are puzzles here about how to define the beginning and\nend of life (Van Dyke 2012; Amerini 2009 [2013]). When it comes to\nnonliving things the situation is still less clear. He clearly thinks\nthat artifacts like a house are not substances. Water is a substance,\nbut it is not clear whether a puddle of water is a single substance or\na collection of substances. Aquinas does not discuss these issues in\nthe sort of detail that later medieval authors would, and as a result\nthere is little scholarly consensus about his views. But one important\nguide to his thinking about substances is that they have unity in a\nvery strong sense: \u201cwhatever is one in substance is one\nabsolutely (simpliciter)\u201d (ST 1a2ae 17.4c). Of\ncourse, no creature has the sort of unity that God has; God\u2019s\nperfect simplicity precludes even the composition of essence and\nexistence, which is found in all created substances, even in\nimmaterial angels (Wippel 2000 ch. 5). Material substances, being\ncomposites of form and matter, have less unity than the angels. Even\nso, Aquinas thinks there can be complex material substances, unified\nby their substantial form. How does a substantial form unify? An\nimportant part of his answer is that a substantial form actualizes not\nonly the whole substance, but each part: \u201ca form of the whole\nthat does not give existence to the individual parts of the body,\n\u2026 such as the form of a house, is an accidental form\u201d\n(ST 1a 76.8c).\n\nSubstantial forms both unify a substance at a given time and\nindividuate a substance over time. To play this role, they must be\nparticulars rather than\n universals.\n In general, it seems that Aquinas thinks that no forms are universals\nexcept inasmuch as we conceive of them in abstraction from\nparticulars. In external reality (in re), \u201cno\ncommonness is found in Socrates; rather, whatever is in him has been\nindividuated\u201d (On Being and Essence 3.80\u20132;\nLeftow 2003; Brower 2016). The principle of individuation, for forms,\nis matter (King 2000; Klima 2000). The account of individuation, then,\ncomes in two stages: matter individuates the form at the start, when\nthe form first inheres in that matter, and from that point forward the\nform possesses a fixed identity of its own. If it is a substantial\nform, it subsequently individuates the substance as a whole.\n\nFundamental to Aquinas\u2019s hylomorphism is his coordinate\ndistinction between potentiality and actuality. His brief treatise\nOn the Principles of Nature, perhaps his earliest work,\nbegins with this remark:\n\nOne should know that some things can be, although they are not, and\nsome things are. That which can be is said to be in potentiality; that\nwhich is now is said to be in actuality.\n\n\nHe goes on to associate potentiality with matter, and actuality with\nform, and draws the distinctions we would expect between the various\nkinds of matters and forms. He also remarks at this point that being\nis of two kinds, and that the being of a substance is \u201csomething\ndifferent\u201d from accidental being. This signals his commitment to\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine of the multivocity (or homonymy) of being.\nWhat it means for a substance to exist is different from what it means\nfor an accidental aggregation of a substance with its accidents (say,\na pale man) to exist. In general, what properly exists is substances,\nwhereas \u201cforms, accidents, and other things of this sort are\ncalled beings not because they themselves exist, but because it is\nby them that something exists\u201d (ST 1a 45.4c).\nMoreover, even among substances, God does not exist in the same way\nthat creatures do, but only in an analogous way (\u00a72). This denial\nof the univocity of being was contentious among later medieval authors\n(most notably\n John Duns Scotus)\n and its correct interpretation remains controversial today (Brower\n2014; Pasnau 2018). Even more problematic is Aquinas\u2019s\nconception of prime matter, which he characterizes as pure\npotentiality: \u201cbeing in actuality is incompatible with\nmatter\u2019s nature, since matter is a potential existent by its\nvery nature\u201d (Quodlibet III.1.1). Although later\nmedieval Aristotelians accepted that substantial change requires a\nmaterial substratum, hardly anyone endorsed Aquinas\u2019s suggestion\nthat it is pure potentiality, because they were convinced that what\nlacks actuality does not exist. Readers of Aquinas have disputed how\nhe himself could have evaded that outcome (Brower 2014 ch. 5), or\nwhether perhaps it is an outcome he intended (Pasnau 2002 ch. 1).\n5. Soul and Body\n\nFor living things, their substantial form is their soul\n(anima). In saying this, Aquinas should not be understood to\nbe ascribing some special sort of spirituality to plants and animals:\nhe thinks they are material objects just as much as rocks and streams\nare. Rather, he is following the lead of Aristotle\u2019s De\nanima in treating the soul as the first principle of life,\nwhatever that may be. Since Aquinas thinks that the primary internal\nexplanation for the existence of any substance is its substantial form\n(\u00a74), it follows that every living substance has a soul that is\nits substantial form.\n\nAs with any substantial form, the primary function of a soul is to\naccount for the substance\u2019s nature as a certain kind of thing,\npossessed of the unity and persistence that characterizes substances.\nThis actualizing role is what Aquinas calls the soul\u2019s essence\n(ST 1a 77.1c). The ongoing existence of living things also\nrequires that they carry out distinctive operations: taking\nnourishment and reproducing, moving and perceiving (in the case of\nanimals), and reasoning (in the human case). Corresponding to these\noperations are the powers of the soul. Medieval authors had long\npuzzled over the relationship between the soul and its powers. Aquinas\ntakes a strong position that would be the subject of much later\ndispute: that the soul\u2019s powers, being potentialities, are\nreally distinct from the soul\u2019s essence, which is an actuality\n(ST 1a 77, Quest. on the Soul 12).\n\nYet even though Aquinas insists on a distinction between the soul and\nits powers, he rejects the common medieval view that living things\nhave multiple souls or multiple substantial forms. Because of his\ncommitment to the absolute unity of a substance, he thinks that\nnothing could count as a substance unless it possesses a unique\nsubstantial form that provides unity, at a time and over time, to the\nsubstance as a whole.\n\nOne thing simpliciter is produced out of many actually\nexisting things only if there is something uniting and in some way\ntying them to each other. In this way, then, if Socrates were an\nanimal and were rational in virtue of different forms, then these two,\nin order to be united simpliciter, would need something to\nmake them one. Therefore, since nothing is available to do this, the\nresult will be that a human being is one thing only as an aggregate,\nlike a heap. (Quest. on the Soul 11c; also ST 1a\n76.3\u20134, Quest. on Spiritual Creatures 3)\n\n\nSuch remarks engendered a long dispute between those who favored this\nsort of \u201cunitarian\u201d approach and those who took one or\nanother \u201cpluralist\u201d position. The pluralists argued that\nliving things contain one substantial form for their body (their\nbodily form, forma corporeitatis) and at least one further\ndistinct form, their soul, in virtue of which they have life (Adams\n1987 ch. 15; Cross 1998 ch. 4; Pasnau 2011 ch. 25). The principal\nargument in favor of pluralism was that it explained how the body of a\nliving thing could persist after the departure of the living\nthing\u2019s soul at death. Aquinas and other unitarians claimed that\nsuch persistence was merely apparent, and that strictly speaking the\nonly thing that endures through a substance\u2019s corruption is\nprime matter.\n\nGiven the tight connection that Aquinas describes between form and\nmatter, it is hard to characterize his theory of souls in general as\n dualistic.\n To be sure, in some sense, material substances are a composite of\nsubstantial form and prime matter (with accidents on the outside, so\nto speak, unified only accidentally with the substance). Still,\nAquinas takes pains to stress that it is the substance as a whole that\nproperly exists. And he definitely does not think that material\nsubstances are a composite of form and body, since the\nmaterial substance is the body. His unitarian framework\ndeliberately makes it incoherent to speak of the body of a living\nthing (or of any substance) as something distinct from that\nsubstance.\n\nThe situation is much more complex, however, when we focus on the\nhuman case. If a dualist is someone who thinks that human beings\nconsist in a material body and an immaterial, spiritual mind, then\nAquinas clearly qualifies, even if he works very hard to get the\nresult that these two aspects of human nature are unified as a single\nsubstance (Baz\u00e1n 1997; Klima 1997 [2002]; Stump 2003 ch. 6).\nAlthough the human soul\u2019s essential role is to actualize a human\nbody, the human soul has a power\u2014its intellect\u2014that\noperates independently of the body. Aquinas has a variety of much\ndiscussed arguments aimed at showing that human thought, given its\nuniversal scope and abstract content, cannot be carried out through\nthe brain or any other bodily instrument (ST 1a 75.2, 75.5;\nQuest. on the Soul 2; Klima 2001; Wood 2020). As a result,\nthe human soul has a unique and puzzling status: it is both the form\nof a body and \u201can incorporeal and subsistent principle\u201d\n(ST 1a 75.2c). From here, Aquinas further argues that the\nhuman soul is incorruptible (ST 1a 75.6, Quest. on the\nSoul 14). For although ordinary subsistent things\u2014material\nsubstances\u2014routinely come into and go out of existence, with the\ncorruption of their bodies, a subsistent entity that is not a body has\nno natural basis for its ceasing to exist. Hence, once God creates a\nhuman soul (in coordination with the biological process of sexual\nreproduction), that soul exists forever.\n\nGiven that the human body is corrupted at death, the soul\u2019s\nincorruptibility entails that, after death, it will continue to exist\nwithout the body. Aquinas devotes considerable attention to the\nquestion of how it will function in that separated state (ST\n1a 89; Quest. on the Soul 15\u201320). Prior to the delicate\nbut all-important question of what such lives will be like (a paradise\nor a hell), there is a still more basic question of whether a human\nperson\u2019s separated soul continues to be that same person. Recent\ncommentators have been divided. Aquinas is very clear that, in this\nlife, a human being is the whole composite substance, form and matter\n(ST 1a 75.4). Also clear is that Aquinas thinks our souls\nwill not be separated from their bodies forever; in the fullness of\ntime, on the Day of Judgment, they will be reunited with their\nresurrected bodies (SCG IV.79\u201397). The situation\nbecomes less clear, however, when Aquinas argues, as he repeatedly\ndoes, that a resurrection of bodies is required because otherwise\nwe would not survive. \u201cAbraham\u2019s soul\u2019s\nhaving life would not suffice for Abraham\u2019s being alive\u2026.\nThe life of the whole compound is required, soul and body\u201d\n(Sentences IV.43.1.1.1 ad 2). This seems to show\nthat Aquinas thinks a person\u2019s soul, surviving apart from its\nbody, is not sufficient for that person\u2019s survival, and some\nscholars (the \u201ccorruptionists\u201d) read Aquinas in this way\n(Toner 2009; Van Dyke 2012; Nevitt 2014). But to others (the\n\u201csurvivalists\u201d) this looks like an incredible result, in\ntension with claims that Aquinas makes elsewhere and with fundamental\nChristian doctrine (Brown 2007; Brower 2014 ch. 12; Stump 2022).\n6. Cognitive Theory\n6.1 Perception\n\nBy definition, the living things that we call animals are those that\nhave the power of perception. Aquinas accepts the conventional list of\nthe five senses\u2014sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch\u2014and\nargues that we arrive at this list of five because there are five\ndiscrete kinds of qualities that make an impression on our bodies.\nThese objects are the proper sensibles\u2014color, sound,\nodor, flavor, hot\u2013cold\u2014so-called because they \u201cmake\nan impression on the senses primarily and per se\u201d\n(ST 1a 78.3 ad 2). In contrast to these are the common\nsensibles\u2014size, shape, number, motion, rest\u2014which\n\u201cdo not move the senses primary and of themselves, but on\naccount of a sensible quality, as a surface does on account of its\ncolor\u201d (ibid.). Whereas each proper sensible is capable of being\nperceived only by its corresponding sense, the common sensibles are\nso-called because they can be grasped by multiple senses, as when we\nboth see and hear a thing move. To these two categories of sense\nobjects Aquinas adds a third category, the accidental\nsensibles, as when I see that someone is alive (Comm. de\nanima II.13.184\u201390). This is, however, not a purely sensory\noperation, but an act of seeing that occurs in conjunction with a\nconceptual judgment that the observed motions are a sign of life. (For\ndiscussions of the perceptual process see Pasnau 2002 chs. 6, 9;\nLisska 2016; De Haan 2019; Cory 2022.)\n\nBeyond these five external senses are the four internal\nsenses that use the brain as their organ. Following the lead of\n Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\n (Avicenna), Aquinas puts considerable weight on these sensory powers\nto explain the sophisticated behavior of animals. In contrast to the\nconsensus over the number of external senses, there had been a great\ndeal of historical disagreement over how many internal senses there\nare. Aquinas settles on this list of four:\n\nthe common sense;\nimagination (or phantasia);\nthe estimative (or cogitative) power;\nmemory.\n\n\nThe precise role of these four faculties is not easy to evaluate on\nthe basis of Aquinas\u2019s limited and scattered remarks, but\naccording to his most prominent account the common sense is what\nallows us to make cross-modal sensory judgments (seeing something as\nwhite and sweet) and to have second-order awareness, for instance\n\u201cwhen someone sees that he is seeing\u201d (ST 1a 78.4\nad 2). The imagination\u2014Aquinas uses both imaginatio and\nphantasia to refer to this faculty\u2014retains images\nacquired through the external senses. The estimative power perceives\nwhat the Arabic tradition referred to as the \u201cintentions\u201d\n(ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b) that lie behind the sensible\nqualities: for instance, that wolves are dangerous and that straw is\nuseful for nest building. (Aquinas refers to the more sophisticated\nhuman capacity for grasping intentions as the cogitative power.)\nMemory preserves these intentions. All of the internal senses are\nrichly engaged in human cognitive activity, which is to say that the\nbrain\u2014despite not being the power of intellect\u2014plays a\ncritical role in human cognition.\n\nThe senses are not wholly immaterial faculties in the way that the\nintellect is, but the respect in which Aquinas thinks they are\nmaterial is a matter of some dispute. He remarks that the senses\noperate \u201cthrough a corporeal organ but not through any corporeal\nquality\u201d (ST 1a 78.1c). By this he intends a contrast\nwith ordinary physical causation, as when a fire, through the quality\nof heat, brings water to a boil. In contrast, when we perceive heat,\neven though the skin is heated in the same way that water is, still\nthe perception itself is not the skin\u2019s being made hot. Rather,\n\u201cthe senses and intellect receive the forms of things\nspiritually and immaterially, in virtue of a kind of intentional\nexistence\u201d (Comm. de sensu 18.208\u201310). In\ngeneral, Aquinas treats the ability to receive forms intentionally as\na mark of the mental:\n\nThings that cognize are distinguished from things that do not cognize\nin this: that the non-cognizers have nothing but their own form alone,\nwhereas that which cognizes is naturally suited to have the form of\nanother thing as well. (ST 1a 14.1c)\n\n\nSuch forms, received intentionally in the external senses, are known\nas sensible species. Received in the internal senses, they are known\nas phantasms. Received in the intellect, they are known as\nintelligible species. Such forms\u2014for instance, the sensible\nspecies of heat\u2014are that in virtue of which we perceive, for\ninstance, the heat of external bodies. That such forms do not make\npossessor actually hot (etc.) is perhaps just what it is for a form to\nexist intentionally. But there is scholarly disagreement over what it\nmeans to say that such forms are \u201cspiritual\u201d and\n\u201cimmaterial\u201d (Hoffman 2014).\n\nAs these passages make clear, perception (and cognition in general)\nworks through the reception of the very form of the thing that is\nbeing perceived. This has led to much discussion over whether Aquinas\nthereby subscribes to a strong form of direct realism, according to\nwhich what we perceive (and what we think about) is the thing itself.\nIn favor of this reading is that Aquinas seems entirely unconcerned\nabout these intentionally existing species as intermediaries lying\nbetween us and the things themselves. Why should he be concerned, the\nthought goes, since the species just is the form itself of the thing\nout in the world? (see Perler 2000; B\u0103ltu\u021b\u0103 2013)\nAgainst this reading is that the species (of heat, say) is not\nnumerically the same form as the one that inheres in the fire, and\nthat Aquinas does, at least sometimes, seem to think of these species\nas representations that mediate our access to external things (Pasnau\n1997 ch. 3; Panaccio 2001; see also Brower and Brower-Toland\n2008).\n6.2 Thought\n\nAquinas thinks that a great deal of complex cognition occurs within\nthe internal senses of the brain, but that those material powers are\nincapable of abstract thought. To be more precise, he thinks that\nmaterial cognitive powers can represent things only as particulars,\nand that universal concepts can be formed only within the immaterial\nintellect. He writes,\n\nIf the intellective soul were composed of form and matter, then the\nforms of things would be received in it as individuals; then it would\ncognize only singular things, as happens in the sensory capacities,\nwhich receive the forms of things in a corporeal organ. (ST\n1a 75.5c)\n\n\nThe senses, both external and internal, can represent only this or\nthat particular cat. It takes the intellect to form the abstract\nconcept of cat. Conversely, Aquinas thinks that the human intellect is\nincapable of grasping particulars (ST 1a 86.1). This means\nthat when we engage in a routine task like apprehending that a thing\nis a cat we are simultaneously using both intellect and sense, using\nthe senses to apprehend the particular, and using the intellect to\nconceptualize what it is. In our more theoretical reflections, we rely\non the internal senses to frame images that aid us in the process of\nabstract reasoning.\n\nFollowing Aristotle\u2019s lead in De anima III.5, Aquinas\ndistinguishes between two distinct intellectual powers, the possible\nintellect and the agent intellect. The first starts out in\npotentiality to all intelligibles, a tabula rasa, \u201clike\na tablet on which nothing has been written\u201d (ST 1a\n79.2c), and gradually becomes actualized, taking in universal concepts\nthat are then stored there as dispositions. But because such concepts\nare not immediately available through sensory experience\u2014one\ncannot grasp what it is to be a cat just by looking at a\ncat\u2014there must also be an active intellectual power, \u201ca\npower on the side of intellect to actualize intelligible things by\nabstracting the species from material conditions\u201d (ST\n1a 79.3c). By Aquinas\u2019s time, generations of Aristotelians had\nalready argued over the correct understanding of these two powers,\nwith some treating the agent intellect as a single higher mind,\nseparate from human beings, and perhaps even to be identified with\nGod.\n Ibn Rushd\n (Averroes), the Spanish philosopher active a half century before\nAquinas, had even proposed treating the possible intellect as\na single higher power to which every human being has shared access.\nAquinas, in contrast, thinks that each human being has their own\nintellect, agent and possible. That we all share in a single agent\nintellect is, he thinks, wrong but not incredible\u2014it has\naffinities with the venerable Augustinian doctrine of\n divine illumination\u2014but\n Aquinas regards the Averroistic doctrine of a separate possible\nintellect as not just contrary to the faith but entirely preposterous,\nsince it would make it impossible to explain how we are each capable\nof individual acts of thought. As he describes the absurd implication\nin his treatise On the Unity of the Intellect against the\nAverroists, \u201cif I think about stone and you do likewise,\nthen it would be necessary that you and I have one and the same\nintellectual operation\u201d (4.101\u20133; see Ogden 2022).\n\nAquinas distinguishes between three principal stages of intellectual\noperation: first, the formation of concepts; second, the composition\nof judgments (propositions) built from concepts; third, inferential\nreasoning from one judgment to another. These last two stages were the\nsubject of intensive study within medieval logic, but Aquinas has\nrelatively little to say about logic, and is most interested in the\ninitial stage of concept formation. Here, the possible intellect\npassively receives concepts that the agent intellect has abstracted\nfrom sensory impressions (phantasms). The possible intellect starts\nout as a blank slate, which is to say that Aquinas rejects the theory\nof innate ideas, at least as far as the possible intellect is\nconcerned. Moreover, he is very clear that all our concepts arise from\nsensory experience: \u201cthe source of our cognition comes from the\nsenses\u201d (ST 1a 84.6sc). From this vantagepoint, he\nlooks more like an empiricist than a rationalist. The role of agent\nintellect, however, complicates the situation. Whereas the possible\nintellect starts out as unformed potentiality, the agent intellect has\nthe actuality to abstract universal concepts from sensory experience.\nIt is not easy to say how abstraction occurs; indeed, for the whole of\nthe Aristotelian tradition, the agent intellect has been something of\na black box whose operation is taken as a brute fact rather than\nanalyzed. Sometimes Aquinas suggests that the transformation of\nsingular content into universal content occurs via the conversion of\nmaterial phantasms into immaterial intelligible species, but the link\nbetween immateriality and universality is not entirely clear. (On\nabstraction see King 1994, Cory 2015).\n6.3 Knowledge and Science\n\nAquinas uses a variety of terms to talk about knowledge, including\nscientia, cognitio and notitia. Often he\nseems to use these terms interchangeably, and he shows no interest in\ntrying to define anything like knowledge in its loose and popular\nsense. He is, however, very much interested in articulating what it\nwould be to have an ideal grasp of some subject, and he refers to such\na thing, speaking strictly, as scientia. This is what both\nthe theologian and the philosopher seek, which is to say that this is\nwhat Aquinas himself seeks. Each of these fields, theology and\nphilosophy, can be described as a single complex\nscientia\u2014that is, as a science. We can also refer to\nthe myriad individual conclusions obtained in these fields as\nscientiae\u2014that is, as items of scientific knowledge.\nPhilosophy itself, moreover, can be divided into various discrete\nfields of science: logic, physics, astronomy, biology, metaphysics,\nethics, and so on. Until the seventeenth century the physical sciences\nwere understood to be contained, in this way, within the field of\nphilosophy. Accordingly, the domains of scientia, conceived\nmost widely, were philosophy and theology.\n\nThe fundamentals of Aquinas\u2019s thinking about knowledge in this\nideal sense come from Aristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics.\nIn particular, he takes the discussion in Book I chapter 2 to offer a\ndefinition of scientia (in Greek,\nepist\u0113m\u0113), which in his commentary he articulates\nas follows (quotations are from Comm. Post. An. I.4):\n\n\u201cto have scientia of something is to cognize it\nperfectly\u201d;\nto have scientia requires grasping the cause of the thing\nknown;\n\u201cscientia is a cognition with certainty of a\nthing\u201d;\nthe object of scientia is true and \u201ccannot stand\notherwise\u201d;\n\u201cto have scientia is the end or effect of a\ndemonstrative syllogism\u201d;\nthe premises of such a syllogism must be \u201ctrue, primary, and\nimmediate\u201d and must be \u201cbetter known, prior, and causes of\nthe conclusion\u201d;\nsuch premises must concern the universal natures of things.\n\n\nEach of these bullet points raises a host of further questions, but,\nin broad outline, Aquinas understands scientia as the\napprehension, with certainty, of an entity, event or proposition,\nbased on a demonstrative proof grounded in the essential nature of the\nthing in question. As befits intellectual understanding (\u00a76.2),\nscientia will concern universal truths. Because it concerns\nthe essences of things, it will concern necessary truths and will get\nat the underlying cause of a thing\u2019s being so (MacDonald\n1993).\n\nEventually, the demand that premises be \u201cbetter known\u201d\nleads back to the first principles of the science, which are\nself-evident (per se nota) in the sense that they are known\nto be true simply in virtue of their terms (Comm. Post.\nAnalytics I.7.8). Nothing could be better known than such a\nprinciple, but because these principles are self-evident there is also\nno need for any further demonstration. Each science has its own\nstarting points\u2014its own first principles\u2014which are not\nsusceptible to demonstration within that science. But not all such\nfirst principles are strictly self-evident. Within physics, for\ninstance, it is a first principle that there is motion, but that is\nneither absolutely necessary nor strictly self-evident. Accordingly,\nagain following Aristotle, Aquinas orders the various sciences\naccording to relations of \u201csubalternation\u201d, such that\nbiology is subalternate to physics, and physics to metaphysics. In\ngeneral, \u201cthe principles of a lower science are proved by the\nprinciples of a higher science\u201d (Comm. Post. Analytics\nI.17.5). Among the natural speculative sciences\u2014that is, setting\ntheology and ethics aside\u2014the preeminent science is metaphysics,\nor first philosophy, \u201cfrom which all the other sciences follow,\ntaking their principles from it\u201d (Comm. Boethius De\ntrin. 5.1c). (On the structure of the sciences see Maurer 1986;\nWippel 1995a; Dougherty 2004.)\n\nThis sort of foundationalist, infallibilist theory of knowledge is now\nthought of as Cartesian, but\n Descartes\n is simply following the Aristotelian tradition for which Aquinas\nbecame the preeminent spokesman. For Aquinas himself, however, the\naccount just described serves as an aspirational ideal rather than a\ndescription of something we have actually attained. In practice, even\nwhere we have demonstrative knowledge, we usually cannot trace the\nprinciples all the way back to ultimate first principles like the law\nof non-contradiction. Critical questions, like the non-eternity of the\nworld (\u00a73), are contingent on the free choice of God and so have\nto be taken on faith. Even in places where certainty is possible in\nprinciple, large gaps in our knowledge remain. In general, \u201cour\ncognition is so weak that no philosopher could have ever completely\ninvestigated the nature of a single fly\u201d (On the\nApostles\u2019 Creed [Collatio in symbolum\nApostolorum], proem). Accordingly, Aquinas distinguishes among\nvarious non-ideal cases. A demonstration that grasps the cause of a\nthing is a demonstration propter quid, but often\u2014as in\nproving God\u2019s existence\u2014the best we can have is a\ndemonstration quia, which tells us only that a thing\nis so. Much of what we know holds true only for the most part, and so\nfails to be necessary, and often the premises of an argument cannot be\ntraced back to self-evident principles, in which case our argument is\ndialectical rather than demonstrative, yielding a conclusion\nthat is merely plausible (probabilis) rather than\napodictic.\n\nIn all of this, Aquinas is following Aristotle and the later\nAristotelian tradition fairly closely, and thus the framework for\nscience and knowledge just sketched comes to be commonly accepted by\nthe later scholastic tradition all the way into the seventeenth\ncentury.\n7. Will and Freedom\n\nThe immaterial human mind, as Aquinas understands it, is not just the\nintellect. The mind is an ensemble of three discrete powers, agent and\npossible intellect working in conjunction with the will. The rise of\nthe will as a faculty of the soul is a distinctively medieval idea,\nbut has strong roots in Augustine and, before him, in late\n Stoicism.\n These late-ancient sources had ascribed a prominent role in human\nagency to desire (appetitus) or volition (voluntas),\nand particularly to those desires that we endorse as our own, and\nwhich thus give rise to voluntary action. Among these earlier authors,\nour will is conceived of as something that we need to control, if we\nare to lead our lives as we should. By Aquinas\u2019s time, however,\nthe will (voluntas) had come to be identified not just as a\npower of the soul but as the power that is principally in control of\nhuman agency, directing both our thoughts and our actions. Thus,\nwhereas Augustine and\n Boethius\n had wondered about how we have free choice (liberum\narbitrium) over our wills, Aquinas identifies the two, concluding\nthat \u201cthe will and free choice are not two powers, but\none\u201d (ST 1a 83.4c). He was by no means the first to\nconceive of the power of will in this way, but the cogency and\ninfluence of his account ensured that this framework would dominate\nlater discussions.\n\nThe will is one of three appetitive powers within us, distinguished\nfrom the irascible and concupiscible powers in being not a sensual\nappetite, the source of the passions (King 1998; Miner 2009), but a\nrational appetite, the source of voluntary agency. Its\nrationality consists in the way it is coordinate with intellect,\ntaking as its inputs the intellect\u2019s practical judgments\nregarding what is to be done. Since the will\u2019s function is\nstrictly appetitive, it cannot render its own practical judgments, and\nto that extent can act only on the basis of intellect: \u201cevery\nchoice and actual will within us is immediately caused by an\nintelligible apprehension\u201d (SCG III.85.3). But that is\nby no means to say that the will is determined by the\nintellect\u2019s judgment, because ultimately our will has the power\nto control what we think about: \u201cthe will moves both itself and\nall other capacities. For I think when I want to, and likewise I use\nall my other capacities and dispositions because I want to\u201d\n(Quest. on Evil 6c). To be sure, by its very nature, the will\ncan desire only what is presented to it as a good (ST 1a2ae\n8.1). Accordingly, since our ultimate happiness (beatitudo)\nis good in every respect, \u201chuman beings have an appetite of\nnecessity for happiness\u201d (ST 1a2ae 10.2c; see\n\u00a78.1). But, with regard to any specific course of action, there\nare always multiple perspectives from which the situation can be\njudged, and the will can control how we think about\nthings\u2014whether, for instance, we decide to focus on how\nrewarding a thing would be or on how tiring it would be. Even in the\ncase of our ultimate happiness, moreover, the will can choose not to\nthink about it, and so even in that extreme case the will\u2019s\nchoices are not necessitated. On this basis Aquinas adamantly insists\non human freedom of choice, and treats claims that the will is\nnecessitated as \u201ccontrary to the faith and subverting all of the\nprinciples of moral philosophy\u201d (Quest. on Evil\n6c).\n\nUp to this point, Aquinas\u2019s position is fairly clear. There has\nbeen considerable controversy over the centuries, however, regarding\nwhether Aquinas wants to go further and characterize the will\u2019s\nagency as\n nondeterministic\u2014as\n its being, in other words, a first and undetermined cause of free\naction. Within a few years of his death, after the\n Condemnation of 1277,\n views of this sort came to dominate scholastic philosophy, yielding a\nbroad consensus that held until the rise of seventeenth-century\nanti-scholasticism. Readers of Aquinas have been sharply divided,\nhowever, over where he fits into that history. At first glance it\nmight seem obvious that Aquinas is an opponent of determinism, given\nhis adamant opposition to the will\u2019s being necessitated. Yet\nAquinas writes at a time at which the governing form of\nAristotelianism, drawn from the Arabic tradition of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\nand Ibn Rushd, is explicitly deterministic. In general, Aquinas\nstrives where he can to harmonize the faith with the mainstream of\nphilosophical opinion, and here in particular he shows signs of\nendorsing causal determinism as applied to the created world. Thus he\nascribes to Ibn Rushd (\u201cthe Commentator\u201d) the doctrine\nthat \u201cfrom that which is open both ways (ad utrumlibet)\nno action follows, unless it is inclined one way by something\nelse\u201d (ST 1a 19.3 obj. 5). He hastens to reject this\nprinciple when applied to God, who is able to determine freely\nGod\u2019s own choices. But outside the case of God he accepts the\nprinciple: \u201ca cause that is of itself contingent must be\ndetermined to its effect by something external\u201d (ibid., ad 5).\nAccordingly, he explicitly insists that the will\u2019s freedom does\nnot require it to be its own first cause. Instead, he characterizes\nthe will\u2019s operations as entwined over time with the operation\nof intellect, running backward through an agent\u2019s history, with\none cause preceding another, all the way back to God\u2019s initial\ncreation of the human soul (Quest. on Evil 6, ST 1a\n83.1 ad 3, ST 1a2ae 9.4c). This insistence on determining\ncauses might seem to fit well with his strict conception of\n divine providence:\n\nEverything that happens here, insofar as it is brought back to the\nfirst divine cause, is found to be ordered rather than to exist\naccidentally, even if in comparison to other causes it is found to\nexist accidentally. This is why the Catholic faith says that nothing\nin the world happens aimlessly or fortuitously, and that all things\nare subject to divine providence. (Comm. Metaphys. VI.3.26;\nsee Goris 1997)\n\n\nOn this reading of Aquinas, causal determinism fits with God\u2019s\npreordained plan for the universe, and freedom is thus compatible with\nboth causal and theological determinism (Hause 1997; Kenny 1993 ch. 6;\nLoughran 1999; Pasnau 2002 ch. 7; Shanley 2007).\n\nMany scholars, however, have denied that Aquinas is any sort of\ncompatibilist. That there is room for doubt is suggested in a passage\nthat, at first, looks to support a compatibilist account:\n\nFreedom does not necessarily require that what is free be the first\ncause of itself, just as one thing\u2019s being the cause of another\ndoes not require that it be the first cause of that other. God, then,\nis the first cause, moving both natural and voluntary causes. And just\nas his moving natural causes does not take away from their acts\u2019\nbeing natural, so his moving voluntary causes does not take away from\ntheir actions\u2019 being voluntary. Instead, he makes this be so for\nthem, because he works within each thing in accord with its own\ncharacter. (ST 1a 83.1 ad 3)\n\n\nAlthough the passage begins in a way that looks friendly to causal\ndeterminism, the passage goes on to suggest the situation is more\ncomplicated. For although God is the first cause of our voluntary\nactions, God\u2019s efficacy there is different from how it is with\nnatural causes: God somehow acts on the will in a way that \u201cdoes\nnot take away\u201d from its voluntariness. And Aquinas takes just\nthe same line in explaining how divine providence is consistent with\nhuman freedom (ST 1a 23.6c; SCG III.72\u201373;\nComm. Metaphys. VI.3.30\u201332; Comm. De interp.\nI.14.22).\n\nAmong those who think that Aquinas\u2019s God leaves room for\nindeterministic human agency, there remains a fundamental difference\nof opinion. Some (e.g., Stump 2003 ch. 9) think that such freedom, for\nAquinas, requires only that the will be an ultimate source, a first\ncreaturely cause. Others think that, in addition to this, Aquinas\nfurther requires the leeway to choose among alternative possibilities\n(e.g., Hoffmann and Michon 2017). Either way, a libertarian reading of\nAquinas is likely to stress his claim that the will is a self-mover:\n\u201cJust as the will moves other capacities, so it also moves\nitself\u201d (Quest. on Evil 6c; Gallagher 1994). This is an\nidea, moreover, that Aquinas had urged from his very first discussion\nof free choice in his Sentences commentary, where he argued\nthat free choice is possessed only by beings who \u201cdetermine for\nthemselves their end and their action toward that end\u201d\n(Sentences II.25.1c). In some sense, then, the will is free\nbecause it is self-determining. This distinguishes it from natural,\nnon-voluntary agents, whose determination comes from without.\nAquinas\u2019s focus on the will\u2019s role in such\nself-determination\u2014a tendency that becomes more prominent in his\nlater works\u2014makes it reasonable to include him in the\nthirteenth-century movement away from ancient intellectualism and\ntoward a voluntaristic conception of human nature. In emphasizing the\nwill\u2019s overarching control, Aquinas can appeal to the critical\nimportance of the will\u2019s various operations and dispositions.\nThe act of love, foundational to any Christian ethics, is an operation\nof will. The dispositions of justice and charity\u2014the central\nvirtues of philosophy and theology, respectively\u2014are both\nvirtues of the will. But it is not clear that Aquinas goes so\nfar\u2014as\n Peter John Olivi,\n Henry of Ghent, and Scotus, among many others, soon would\u2014as to\nexempt the will from the determinism that was agreed to characterize\nthe rest of the natural world. There remains a lively debate among\nscholars over this issue.\n8. Ethics\n\nAquinas\u2019s ethics is difficult to study because it is so vast and\nmultifaceted. Around half of the Summa theologiae, the\nmassive second part, is concerned with moral questions, suggesting\nsomething of the importance Aquinas ascribes to ethics in theology. To\nbring some order to this large topic, we can distinguish between three\nparts of the theory:\n\nhis conception of happiness as the goal of human life;\nhis framework for the moral law, grounded in a theory of natural\nlaw;\nhis understanding of the virtues as essential to human\nhappiness.\n\n\n(For wide-ranging treatments of Aquinas\u2019s ethics see McInerny\n1997; MacDonald and Stump 1998; Pope 2002; Irwin 2007: chs\n16\u201324; DeYoung, McCluskey, and Van Dyke 2009; McCluskey\n2017.)\n8.1 Happiness\n\nAquinas\u2019s worldview is thoroughly teleological, inasmuch as he\nholds \u201cit is necessary that all agents act for the sake of an\nend\u201d (ST 1a2ae 1.2c). There is a distinction to be\ndrawn, however, between those agents that are unable to understand\ntheir end and rational agents, who \u201cmove themselves to their end\nbecause they have control over their acts through free choice\u201d\n(ibid.). It is for rational agents that ethical questions arise.\nAquinas follows Aristotle in supposing that human choices must be\nordered toward a single ultimate end: \u201cthere must be some\nultimate end on account of which all other things are desired, whereas\nthis end itself is not desired on account of anything else\u201d\n(Comm. Nic. Ethics I.1.22). This ultimate end, whatever it\nis, can be referred to as happiness (beatitudo). In the\nTreatise on Happiness from the start of ST 1a2ae, after\nworking through various predictably unsatisfactory candidates for our\nultimate end\u2014not riches, not honor, not pleasure, and so\non\u2014Aquinas arrives at the view that happiness consists primarily\nin intellectual contemplation. And since the highest truth and the\ngreatest good are of course God, our ultimate happiness must lie\nthere: \u201cfinal and complete happiness can consist in nothing\nother than the vision of the divine essence\u201d (ST 1a2ae\n3.8c). Human beings possess this most fully in the life to come (Brown\n2021), but even in this life Aquinas\u2019s conception of happiness\nis strongly intellectualist: \u201cit is clear that people who give\nthemselves to the contemplation of truth are the happiest a person in\nthis life can be\u201d (Comm. Nic. Ethics X.12.2110).\n\nThis eudaimonistic framework\u2014to use the Greek term for ethical\ntheories aimed at happiness\u2014shapes all of Aquinas\u2019s\nethical thinking. It is perhaps the most striking instance of his\nconfidence in Aristotelianism as the proper philosophical foundation\nfor a Christian worldview. Predictably, that confidence was met with\nvarious sorts of challenges. One concerns his insistence that our\nultimate end is intellectual rather than volitional. For many\nsubsequent theorists, Christian and secular, the ultimate end of human\nlife should not be intellectual contemplation but instead should be\nlove. Aquinas agrees\u2014indeed, he stresses\u2014that love is an\nessential complement to happiness, pulling us toward our end and\nrejoicing in its grasp. Still, the goal of life properly speaking is\nto understand God and God\u2019s creation (ST 1a2ae 3.4).\n(For nuanced discussions see Stenberg 2016a and Stump 2022.)\n\nA second concern, which troubles eudaimonism in all of its forms, is\nthat Aquinas rests the foundations of ethics on a self-directed\nconcern for our own happiness. That is liable to look like a doubtful\nstrategy for any ethical theory, and particularly for\nJudeo\u2013Christian ethics given its radically altruistic\norientation, as epitomized in the twin injunctions to \u201cLove the\nLord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all\nyour mind\u201d and to \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself\u201d\n(Matthew 22:37\u201339, quoting Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18).\nOn its face, the eudaimonistic approach might seem to conflict\ndirectly with these injunctions, given the way that it grounds all\nhuman agency in our ultimate pursuit of happiness:\n\nThe will naturally tends towards its ultimate end: for every human\nbeing naturally wills happiness. And this natural willing is the cause\nof all other willings, since whatever a human being wills, he wills\nfor the sake of an end. (ST 1a 60.2c)\n\n\nAquinas is unflinching in his insistence that our final end is our own\nhappiness. But it has to be remembered that \u2018happiness\u2019 is\njust a generic label for the human activity that is ultimately best\nfor us. And what is ultimately best for us is not the selfish pursuit\nof our own wellbeing, which is surely an ambition that would make\nanyone miserable. What we should seek, as we have seen already, is an\nunderstanding of the world and its Creator. This, again speaking\nteleologically, is what we were created to do. By pursuing this\nsubstantive goal, and actualizing our intellectual capacities to the\nutmost, we make ourselves as good as we can be, and we contribute to\nthe universe as a whole\u2019s being as good as it can be. How does\nsuch intellectual activity ground a theory of ethics? It does so\nbecause when we understand God and the created order, we understand\nwhy we should love God preeminently and why we should love our\nneighbor. But to see how these ideas get developed, we need to turn to\nhis theory of the moral law. (For general discussions of\nAquinas\u2019s eudaimonistic framework see MacDonald 1991b; Bradley\n1997; Kenny 1998; Osborne 2005; Stenberg 2016b.)\n8.2 Natural Law\n\nAquinas\u2019s moral theory does not offer the sort of brief and\ncomprehensive criterion for rightness and wrongness that draws\nstudents toward\n consequentialism\n or\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy.\n What he offers instead is a deep and systematic explanation of where\nmorality comes from, yielding a moral code that is impressively\nresponsive to the changing circumstances of human life.\n\nThe key text for Aquinas\u2019s thinking about the moral law is his\nTreatise on Law (ST 1a2ae 90\u2013108). There he\ndistinguishes between four kinds of law that play a role in guiding\nright human action:\n\neternal law: God\u2019s plan of governance for the world (q.\n93);\nnatural law: the distinctive way rational beings participate in\nthe eternal law (q. 94);\nhuman law: particular developments of natural law worked out by\nhuman reason (qq. 95\u201397);\ndivine law: divinely revealed laws directing human beings to their\nend (qq. 98\u2013108).\n\n\nThe eternal law governs everything, but can serve to guide us only\nwhen it is somehow transmitted to us. One way in which it is\ntransmitted is through divine law, preeminently through the Bible, and\nhere Aquinas distinguishes between the old law of the Hebrew Bible\n(qq. 98\u2013105) and the new law described in the Gospel (qq.\n106\u20138). The other form of transmission, philosophically the most\ninteresting part of his account, is the\n natural law.\n Whereas human law is the contingent result of social and political\norganization, the natural law is innate within us. Since Aquinas\nthinks that God orders everything to its proper end (\u00a78.1), there\nis a sense in which all things follow a natural law by which they\nparticipate in the eternal law. But when Aquinas refers to natural law\nin a moral context, he means the distinctive way in which rational\nagents have been ordered to achieve their proper end; hence he has in\nmind a law that governs the mind. Thus, \u201cthe law of nature is\nnothing other than the light of intellect, placed within us by God,\nthrough which we grasp what is to be done and what is to be\navoided\u201d (On the Ten Commandments [Collationes in\ndecem praeceptis] proem).\n\nSo described, natural law might be nothing more than an innate\ninclination to accept a fixed set of moral laws prescribed by God. In\nfact, however, Aquinas\u2019s theory offers something more complex\nand nuanced, because he thinks the moral law arises not out of brutely\ninnate inclination but out of rational reflection on the good (Finnis\n1998 ch. 3; Rhonheimer 1987 [2000]). Mirroring the way he develops\ntheoretical science out of first principles (\u00a76.3), he thinks\nmoral reasoning also rises out of self-evident first principles, the\ngrasp of which is the defining task of the intellect\u2019s power of\nsynderesis (ST 1a 79.12). The most fundamental such precept\nis this:\n\nThe good should be done and pursued, and the bad should be avoided.\n(ST 1a2ae 94.2c)\n\n\nAquinas takes this to be self-evident, because he accepts\nAristotle\u2019s claim at the start of the Nicomachean\nEthics that the good is what all things desire. By beginning\nhere, Aquinas builds into the ground floor of his account a\nsubstantive story about\n moral motivation.\n The story requires tying the ensuing development of his theory to\nfacts about what human beings actually desire; without that tie, the\ntheory would equivocate on what it means by the good. Aquinas\nexplicitly recognizes as much, remarking that \u201cthe order of the\nprecepts of natural law accords with the order of natural\ninclinations\u201d (ST 1a2ae 94.2c). At this point, Aquinas\ncould appeal to eudaimonism: that all human beings desire happiness as\ntheir ultimate end (\u00a78.1). A very thin conception of natural law\nmight suppose that human beings are given only this much innate\ndirection, and thereafter left to sort out for themselves what will\nmake them happy. But Aquinas\u2019s conception of natural law is much\nthicker, both in the sense that he articulates a rich and substantive\nnotion of the happiness that is our ultimate end (as above), and in\nthe sense that he thinks we have been given various further innate\ninclinations, intended to provide us with specific guidance toward\nthat ultimate end. Among these are inclinations to preserve our own\nlives, toward sexual activity, toward educating the young, toward\nknowing the truth about God, and toward living in society (ST\n1a2ae 94.2c; see also SCG III.129). These innate\ninclinations, combined with the first practical principle (\u201cThe\ngood should be done\u2026\u201d) and Aquinas\u2019s substantive\nconception of happiness, are the foundations from which arises a\ncomprehensive account of the moral law, relying on\n conscience\n as the rational activity of working out what ought to be done from a\nmoral point of view (ST 1a 79.13).\n\nInasmuch as the moral point of view is no different from the point of\nview that seeks our own happiness, Aquinas shares with ancient ethics\nthe conviction that rational self-interest provides an adequate\nfoundation for morality (Irwin 2007: ch. 19). But the weight Aquinas\nputs on our innate inclinations in shaping the moral law gives his\naccount a distinctive character. Among its champions, this approach\nhas been celebrated for the way it grounds traditional values in facts\nabout human nature. To its critics, the view looks intellectually\ndubious twice over: on scientific grounds inasmuch as it makes false\nclaims about the universality of various inclinations (Massey 1999);\nand philosophically inasmuch as it grounds\n normativity in metaethics\n on descriptive facts about human nature. Such criticisms, however,\nmiss the philosophical sophistication of the overarching framework. To\nbe sure, we now understand the diversity of human\ninclinations\u2014for instance, regarding gender and\nsexuality\u2014much better than we did even a century ago.\nAquinas\u2019s theory can survive when we update these assumptions,\nand indeed may generate surprisingly modern results (Oliva 2015). As\nfor the complaint that the theory conflates normativity with nature,\nthat would have real force only supposing that we had some better\naccount of the basis of normative value. As things are, if there is a\nGod, then it seems plausible to suppose that God would want us to be\nhappy and would create our natures to guide us in seeking such\nhappiness. On the other hand, if there is no God, then it is not clear\nwhat foundation for ethics there might be other than facts about the\nnature of human beings and how we best thrive in the world we live in.\n(The literature on the natural law in Aquinas is large and\ncontentious. For a sample see Grisez 1965; Lisska 1996; Murphy 2001;\nJensen 2015; Porter 2018. For an introduction to the variety of recent\nperspectives see Angier 2021. For a sense of the complexity of the\ncontested issues see\n Aquinas\u2019 moral, political, and legal philosophy.)\n8.3 Virtue Theory\n\nThe theory of natural law gives us Aquinas\u2019s moral theory: it\nidentifies the foundations of ethics and frames the general contours\nof the moral law. For us to adhere to that law, however, it is not\nenough to trust to the light of intellect and our natural\ninclinations. Reliably moral agents must, in addition, cultivate the\nright sorts of virtuous dispositions. Accordingly, Aquinas develops a\ncomplex\n virtue ethics\n to frame his account of our moral psychology.\n\nThe virtues are a certain kind of psychological disposition\n(habitus): they are the perfections of those powers of the\nsoul that are under our voluntary control. Aquinas devotes roughly a\nquarter of the Summa theologiae\u2014mainly the\n2a2ae\u2014to his theory of the virtues, and also dedicates a series\nof disputed questions to the subject. He takes from Aristotle the\nfamiliar idea that it is through the repetition of certain kinds of\nactions that we acquire the virtues (as well, of course, as the\nvices): by acting honestly we acquire, over time, the virtue of\nhonesty. Less familiarly, he imposes a very high standard on what\ncounts as a virtue: it must be incapable of giving rise to an immoral\nact.\n\nTwo things are required for an act\u2019s perfection: first, the act\nmust be right; second, the [underlying] disposition must be incapable\nof being the source of a contrary act. For that which is the source of\ngood and bad acts cannot, of itself, be the perfect source of a good\nact. (Quest. on the Virtues in General 2c)\n\n\nThis is not to say that a person with the virtue of honesty cannot be\ndishonest. Just as virtues can be acquired through practice, so they\ncan be lost through the wrong kind of practice, and that loss must\nbegin somewhere. Still, in such a case, the dishonesty will not arise\nthrough the virtue. Any characterization of a virtue that would make\nits possession a mixed blessing would have failed to delimit a true\nvirtue.\n\nThe reason that the virtues are so important to Aquinas\u2019s ethics\nis that he thinks that we cannot, over time, act morally without them.\nHe highlights three reasons why moral activity requires the virtues\n(Quest. on the Virtues in General 1c):\n\nfor uniformity of action, avoiding unreliable vicissitudes;\nto be prompt in that action, rather than needing constantly to\ndeliberate;\nto take pleasure in the action, as a kind of second nature.\n\n\nThese are not meant to be necessary conditions on an act\u2019s\ngoodness, but Aquinas thinks they are required for a person\u2019s\nactions to count as wholly praiseworthy. In contrast to the effortful\ncalculations of a utilitarian striving to maximize the beneficial\nconsequences of every act, he thinks moral goodness requires a\ndispositional stability in our underlying psychology. And given\nmorality\u2019s ultimate basis in Aquinas\u2019s overarching theory\nof happiness, it should be no surprise that he thinks happiness, in\nthis life, consists in our acting through these virtues (ST\n1a2ae 5.5\u20136).\n\nAmong the many fine-grained distinctions that Aquinas makes between\nvarious virtues and vices, he treats as preeminent the traditional\nfour cardinal virtues and the three theological virtues. The cardinal\nvirtues are\n\nprudence: the perfection of the intellect\u2019s\n practical reasoning\n (ST 2a2ae 47\u201351);\njustice:\n the will\u2019s stable disposition to give to each individual what\nis due to him (ST 2a2ae 58);\nbravery: the strength of the irascible appetite in pursuing what\nis in accord with reason (ST 2a2ae 143);\ntemperance: the moderation of the concupiscible appetite with\nrespect to its desires that conflict with reason (ST 2a2ae\n141).\n\n\nUnlike some of his contemporaries, who argued that all the virtues\nshould be dispositions of the will (Kent 1995), Aquinas thinks that\neach of these four virtues perfects a different power of the soul.\nBravery and temperance, indeed, are not perfections of rational powers\nat all. They are, however, defined in terms of right reason, and this\nboth connects his virtue theory to the theory of natural law and helps\nto explain why the virtues cannot be the cause of immoral actions. The\nperson who is \u201cbrave\u201d in a foolhardy way would not\nstrictly count as brave. Deepening the connection between these\nvirtues and right reason is that Aquinas treats the intellectual\nvirtue of prudence (prudentia, or phron\u0113sis in\nGreek) as foundational to all the other cardinal virtues:\n\u201crightness and full goodness in all the other virtues comes from\nprudence\u201d (Quest. on the Virtues in General 6c; see\nWestberg 1994). Without prudence, none of the other virtues are\npossible. Conversely, prudence itself requires the proper disposition\nof our various appetitive powers. Accordingly, Aquinas endorses the\ntraditional doctrine of the unity of the virtues: one cannot have any\nof them without having all of them (ST 1a2ae 65.1).\n\nAlthough the four cardinal virtues, as their name suggests, have\nhistorically been given pride of place within philosophy, Aquinas\ngives greater preeminence to the theological virtues that Paul\ndescribes in 1 Corinthians 13:\n\nfaith: the intellectual disposition to assent to what is not\napparent (ST 2a2ae 1\u20137);\nhope: the will\u2019s dispositional confidence in achieving a\ngood that is difficult to obtain (ST 2a2ae 17\u201318);\ncharity: the will\u2019s disposition for perfect love\n(ST 2a2ae 23\u201327).\n\n\nFor these to count as theological virtues, rather than as\ngeneric dispositions, they must each be further defined as having God\nas their object. They must also be understood to be infused in us by\nGod, because the humanly attainable versions of these virtues are not\nsufficient for our moral perfection (ST 1a2ae 62.1). Indeed,\nfor similar reasons, moral perfection requires that even the cardinal\nvirtues be infused by God (ST 1a2ae 63.3). To receive the\nvirtues from God requires grace, which is something we can never fully\nmerit, and which God freely chooses to give or to withhold: \u201cno\nmatter how much someone prepares himself, he does not receive grace\nfrom God necessarily\u201d (ST 1a2ae 112.3sc). Only through\nthis grace, and the infused virtues it brings, can we achieve the\nperfect happiness that is our ultimate end. (On the cardinal virtues\nsee Hause 2007; Stump 2011. On the theological virtues see Wawrykow\n2012; Porter 2019. On the infused cardinal virtues see Mattison 2011;\nGoris and Schoot 2017; Knobel 2021. On grace see Torrell 1996 [2003]\nchs. 6\u20139; Stump 2018 ch. 7; Hoffmann 2022.)\n9. Influence\n\nDuring his lifetime, Aquinas was recognized as an extraordinary figure\nboth for his intellectual achievements and for his personal sanctity.\nThe immense number of surviving manuscripts and the wide range of his\ninfluence testifies to the first. As for the second, his death in\nFossanova immediately gave rise to the sort of veneration reserved for\nthe saints: claims of miracles at once arose, and a long-running\ndispute began over where the holy relic of his body would be kept.\nThis process culminated in his canonization on July 18, 1323.\n\nThese developments notwithstanding, many of Aquinas\u2019s specific\nviews\u2014particularly in philosophy\u2014were extremely\ncontroversial. Among the 219 articles condemned in Paris in 1277 are a\nsignificant number that seem to implicate Aquinas\u2019s teachings\n(Hissette 1977; Wippel 1995b). It would have been lost on no one at\nthe time that these articles were promulgated three years, to the day,\nafter his death. It seems likely that the authorities in Paris were\nplanning an explicit censure of certain of Aquinas\u2019s core\ntheses\u2014especially his unitarian theory of substantial form\n(\u00a75) and his conception of prime matter as pure potentiality\n(\u00a74)\u2014until higher authorities cut this process short\n(Torrell 1993 [2022] ch. 16). Later in March 1277, in Oxford,\nArchbishop\n Robert Kilwardby\n condemned a series of theses that explicitly includes those two\ndistinctively Aquinian doctrines. Also around this time, the\nFranciscan William de la Mare published a lengthy Correctorium\nfratris Thomae, with verbatim quotations from Aquinas\u2019s\ncorpus paired with putative \u201ccorrections\u201d. Soon after,\nvarious disciples of Aquinas rallied to his defense, in a series of\nworks entitled the Correctorium Corruptorii Thomae (Glorieux\n1927; Jordan 1982). For the quarter century after Aquinas\u2019s\ndeath, scholasticism took shape around his Dominican supporters and\nhis Franciscan critics.\n\nIn the early fourteenth century, Aquinas\u2019s influence had to\ncompete against the emergence of two brilliantly original Franciscans:\nfirst Scotus and his expansive realism; then\n William Ockham\n and his parsimonious nominalism. In the face of these and many other\ncomplex crosscurrents, Aquinas\u2019s views came to seem both less\nurgent and less dangerous. Two years after his canonization, the\nbishop of Paris clarified that the 1277 condemnations should not be\nheld to apply to Aquinas\u2019s teaching, though the bishop made\nclear that this should not be taken as an endorsement. Among the many\nemerging rival views, Aquinas continued to have his vociferous\nsupporters, particularly among the Dominicans, who were statutorily\nrequired to promote his teaching. In the early fifteenth century, John\nCapreolus emerged as a champion of Thomism as a systematic philosophy,\nand a century later Cajetan (Thomas de Vio) made further systematic\ndevelopments. In 1567, Pope Pius V numbered Aquinas among the doctors\nof the Church, a title previously reserved for the ancient Church\nfathers. When the Jesuit order came to prominence, around this same\ntime, its members\u2014including\n Francisco Su\u00e1rez\u2014were\n enjoined to adhere to those views that were safest and best\nestablished, and especially to those of Aquinas, \u201cbecause of his\nauthority and his more secure and approved teachings\u201d (Pasnau\n2011, 436).\n\nEven as Thomism gradually became ascendant within scholastic\nAristotelianism, that whole tradition started to look more and more\nhidebound, as it moved into its increasingly mannerist and then\nbaroque stages.\n Martin Luther\u2019s\n hostility toward the Roman Catholic Church mirrored his hostility\ntoward scholastic philosophy and theology: \u201csoon no Thomist,\nAlbertist, Scotist, or Ockhamist will be left in the world, but all\nwill be simple children of God and true Christians\u201d (Oberman\n1966, 18\u201319). The Italian humanists attacked from a different\ndirection, prizing historical scholarship over intricate metaphysics.\nBy the seventeenth century,\n Thomas Hobbes\n and his contemporaries flaunted their scorn for the scholastics, who\n\u201cconverse in questions of matters incomprehensible\u201d\n(Leviathan viii.27). It would not be until the eighteenth\ncentury, however, that these \u201cmoderns\u201d began to drive the\nThomists and other scholastics out of the universities. (On the\nreception of Aquinas over the centuries see Levering and Plested\n2021.)\n\nIn 1879, Pope Leo XIII called for a revival in the study and teaching\nof Aquinas. One fruit of this encyclical was the founding of the\ndefinitive Leonine edition of Aquinas\u2019s work. Another was a\nrenewal of the old Thomistic picture of Aquinas as standing at the\nsummit of philosophical and theological achievement, leaving\nsubsequent developments\u2014from Scotus to Descartes, Kant and\nbeyond\u2014to be dismissed as just so much decline and decay. Such\nzeal was hardly likely to be sustained for long, however, and the\ntwentieth century witnessed a flourishing of Thomisms of all kinds, in\nscholars like\n Jacques Maritain,\n Etienne Gilson,\n Elizabeth Anscombe,\n and Alasdair MacIntyre. As more recent scholarship has deepened our\nunderstanding both of Aquinas and of his successors, we now have a\nmuch fuller picture of the richness of later medieval philosophy.\nAquinas today, viewed as a philosopher, looks not so much like the\nculmination of an era, but rather like the brilliant beginning of\nEurope\u2019s philosophical renaissance.\n",

Fratres Praedicatores (Rome:\nCommissio Leonina, 1882\u2013), 50 vols.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nRecent volumes are particularly useful for the extensive scholarly\nnotes, which trace in detail the antecedents to Aquinas\u2019s\nthought.</p>\n<p>\nReaders satisfied with a roughly accurate Latin text may find it more\nconvenient to consult online the searchable\n <a href=\"https://www.corpusthomisticum.org/\">Corpus Thomisticum</a>.\n This essential resource also provides electronic versions of many of\nthe Leonine volumes, information on the best editions of works not yet\navailable in the Leonine edition, and Sch\u00fctz\u2019s very useful\n<em>Thomas-Lexikon</em>.</p>\n<p>\nMost of Aquinas is available in English translation, and is often\navailable online.\n <a href=\"https://aquinas-in-english.neocities.org/\">Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Bonin</a>\n maintains a comprehensive catalog. Listed here are only a few\nespecially noteworthy translations.</p>\n<p>\nGiven the size and range of the corpus, no single-volume anthology can\nbe adequate. Among the many attempts is</p>\n<blockquote>\nThomas Aquinas. <em>Basic Works</em>, ed. Jeffrey Hause and Robert\nPasnau (Indianapolis: Hackett, 2014).\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nThis collection is based in part on a series of translations, the\nHackett Aquinas, which offers a translation and commentary on key\ntexts.</p>\n<p>\nWhat follows lists the principal works and those minor works that have\nspecial philosphical interest.

Encyclopedic Theological Treatises</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Scriptum super libros Sententiarum (The Commentary on Peter\nLombard\u2019s Sentences)</em> (1252\u201356)\n\n<p class=\"bibnote\">\nA massive and wide-ranging work, composed during Aquinas\u2019s term\nas bachelor of theology and the first part of his first term as master\nof theology. Until the Leonine version is published, the best Latin\ntext is the edition by Pierre Mandonnet and Maria F. Moos (Paris: P.\nL\u00e9thielleux, 1929\u201347), which is complete through book IV\ndistinction 22. The\n <a href=\"https://aquinas.cc/\">Aquinas Institute</a>\n (Wyoming) is producing an online English translation that is nearing\ncompletion and looks to be of high quality.</p> </li>\n<li><em>Summa contra gentiles</em> (1259\u201365)\n\n<p class=\"bibnote\">\nThis is Aquinas\u2019s second-most important work, after the\n<em>Summa theologiae</em>. Remarkably, the autograph manuscript has\nsurvived for much of this work and can be admired\n <a href=\"https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.lat.9850\">online</a>\n (although Aquinas\u2019s handwriting is notoriously difficult to\nread, even for experts). The best complete English translation, with\nthe Latin text in a parallel column, is available\n <a href=\"https://isidore.co/aquinas/ContraGentiles.htm\">online</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><em>Summa theologiae</em> (1267\u201373, unfinished after 3a 90)\n\n<p class=\"bibnote\">\nAquinas\u2019s masterpiece, which he began in Rome and worked on\nuntil near the end his life. The Leonine volumes for this work, from\nthe nineteenth century, are no longer considered adequate, and will\neventually be reedited. The best (and now mostly complete) full\nEnglish translation is that of Alfred Freddoso, available\n <a href=\"https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/summa-translation/TOC.htm\">online</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>A2. Disputed Questions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>On Truth</em> (1256\u201359)\n\n<p class=\"bibnote\">\nAquinas\u2019s first and largest set of disputed questions, from his\nfirst term as master in Paris. The title refers to just the first of\nthe 29 questions; the other 28 (making a total of 253 articles) take\nup many wide-ranging topics.</p> </li>\n<li><em>On God\u2019s Power</em> (1265\u201366)</li>\n<li><em>On the Soul</em> (1266\u201367)</li>\n<li><em>On Spiritual Creatures</em> (1267\u201368)</li>\n<li><em>On Evil (De malo)</em> (1270\u201371)</li>\n<li><em>On the Virtues (</em>1271\u201372)</li>\n<li><em>On the Union of the Incarnate Word</em> (1272)</li>\n<li><em>Quodlibetal Questions</em> (1256\u201359, 1268\u201372)\n\n<p class=\"bibnote\">\nBy tradition, masters at Paris participated in disputations during\nAdvent and Lent at which audience members might propose any topic at\nall. Aquinas\u2019s large and varied collection of <em>Quodlibetal\nQuestions</em> is split between his two terms as master, with\nquodlibets 7\u201311 dating from his first term and quodlibets\n1\u20136 and 12 dating from his second term. There is now an English\ntranslation by Nevitt and Davies (OUP 2019).</p> </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>A3. Brief Works (<em>Opuscula</em>)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>On the Principles of Nature</em> (<em>De principiis\nnaturae</em>) (early 1250s)\n\n<p class=\"bibnote\">\nA rather conventional summary of medieval natural philosophy, written\nno later than Aquinas\u2019s term in Paris as a bachelor and perhaps,\njudging from its content, even earlier than that. Its brevity and\nphilosophical focus makes it useful for novices today. Stump and\nChanderbhan translate it in the Hackett <em>Basic Works</em>\nvolume.</p> </li>\n<li><em>On Being and Essence</em> (<em>De ente et essentia</em>)\n(1252\u201356).\n\n<p class=\"bibnote\">\nA famous brief treatise on various foundational questions in\nmetaphysics, dating from Aquinas\u2019s time as bachelor in Paris.\nPeter King translates it in the Hackett <em>Basic Works</em>\nvolume.</p> </li>\n<li><em>Compendium theologiae</em> (begun in the early 1260s,\nunfinished)\n\n<p class=\"bibnote\">\nA relatively brief digest of material found at much greater length in\nthe <em>Summa theologiae</em> and elsewhere.</p> </li>\n<li><em>On Kingship (De regno, or De regimine principum)</em>\n(1266\u201367?, unfinished)</li>\n<li><em>On the Unity of the Intellect (De unitate intellectus contra\nAverroistas)</em> (1270)</li>\n<li><em>On the Eternity of the World</em> (1271)</li>\n<li><em>On Separate Substances</em> (1271 or later, unfinished)</li>\n<li><em>On the Mixture of Elements</em> (1269?)</li>\n<li><em>On the Hidden Workings of Nature (De occultis operationibus\nnaturae)</em> (1268\u201372?)</li>\n<li><em>On the Motion of the Heart</em> (<em>De motu cordis</em>)\n(1273?)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>A4.
