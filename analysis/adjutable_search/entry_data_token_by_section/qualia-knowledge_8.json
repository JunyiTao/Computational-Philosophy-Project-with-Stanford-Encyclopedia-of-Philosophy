To show\nthat imaginative abilities are not necessary for knowing what it is\nlike, Conee (1994) and Alter (1998) cite the example of a person who\nhas no capacity to imagine having color experiences. They claim that\ndespite this defect she would know what it is like to have an\nexperience of e.g. green while attentively staring at something that\nlooks green to her. To show that imaginative abilities are not\nsufficient for knowing what it is like Conee introduces the following\nexample: A person, Martha, \u201cwho is highly skilled at visualizing\nan intermediate shade that she has not experienced between pairs of\nshades that she has experienced\u2026happens not to have any\nfamiliarity with the shade known as cherry red.\u201d Martha is told\nthat cherry red is midway between burgundy red and fire red (she has\nexperienced the latter two shades of red). Given this information and\nher extraordinary capacity, Martha has the ability to imagine cherry\nred, but as long as she does not exercise this ability she\ndoes not know what it is like to see cherry red.\n\nA similar example is used for the same purpose and discussed in more\ndetail by Raymont 1999. Raymont argues that mnemic, recognitional and\nimaginative abilities neither separately nor conjointly amount to\nknowing of what it is like to have a particular kind of experience. He\nfirst argues that none of these abilities is necessary and sufficient\nfor knowing what it is like: (a) Mnemic abilities are not necessary,\nsince someone can learn what an experience is like when first having\nit without already remembering an experience of the relevant kind. (b)\nImaginative abilities are not sufficient since someone can have the\nability to imagine a particular kind of experience without exercising\nit (see the example cited above). (c) To show that recognitional\nabilities are not sufficient either, Raymont cites empirical data\n\u201cin support of the view that one can have the ability to\nnoninferentially recognize a certain type of visual experience without\never having had it, and thus without knowing what it is like to have\nit\u201d. But then these three kinds of abilities cannot conjointly\namount to knowing what it is like either: if they did,\nthen \u2013 contrary to (a) \u2013 each of them would have to be a\nnecessary condition for knowing what it is like.\n\nGertler (1999) argues that the best candidate for an analysis in the\nspirit of the Ability Hypothesis is to identify knowing what it is\nlike to have an experience of red with the ability to recognize\nseeing-red experiences by their phenomenal quality and then goes on to\nattack this candidate: she points out that the ability to recognize\nseeing-red experiences by their phenomenal quality can be explained by\nthe fact that I know what it is like to see red but not vice\n versa.[3]\n\nMichael Tye (2000) concedes that none of the abilities considered by\nLewis is necessary for knowing what it is like and he discusses the\nfollowing possible revision of the Ability Hypothesis: knowing what it\nis like to have an experience of red is the ability to apply an\nindexical concept to an experience of red (while having it) via\nintrospection. But, he goes on to argue, this revised version can\nagain be rejected by a counterexample that shows that the ability at\nissue is not sufficient for knowing what it is like: If Mary is\ndistracted and does not attend to her experience when she first sees a\nred object, then she need not apply any concept to her experience at\nall. In this case, she still does not know what it is like to have red\nexperiences although she has the ability to apply an\nindexical concept to her present experience (she has the ability, but,\nbeing distracted, she does not exercise it). Tye concedes that the\nrevised version of the Ability Hypothesis could not, anyway, be used\nagainst the knowledge argument in the way that was originally\nintended. The reason is that the revised version is compatible with\nthe view that Mary does acquire knowing-that if she is not distracted\nwhen first seeing something red: she learns that this is a\nred experience (where \u201cthis\u201d refers introspectively to her\npresent experience) and so acquires knowing-that. According to Tye to\nhave indexical knowledge of this kind is sufficient but not necessary\nfor knowing what it is like to have a red experience. After all, it is\nimpossible to introspectively refer to a red experience without\npresently having that kind of experience, but Tye wishes to concede\nthat a person can know what it is like to have a red experience while\nnot presently having a red experience. This reasoning motivates his\ndisjunctive account of knowing what it is like: \u201cS\nknows what it is like to undergo experience E iff either\nS now has indexical knowledge-that with respect to E\nobtained via current introspection or S has the Lewis\nabilities with respect to E\u201d (Tye 2000). Tye thus\ndefends the physicalist view against the knowledge argument by a\ncombination of the two strategies mentioned above: he applies the\nNew Knowledge/Old Fact-strategy to the person who knows what\nit is like to have an experience in the sense of the first conjunct\n(the indexical thought at issue is made true by a physical fact) and\nhe applies the No Propositional Knowledge-strategy to the\ncase of someone who has knowing what it is like in the sense of the\nsecond disjunct.\n\nLycan (1996) argues against the Ability Hypothesis and for the view\nthat Mary acquires new knowledge-that after release by claiming that\n\u201cS knows what it is like to see blue\u201d means\nsomething like \u201cS knows that it is like Q to\nsee blue\u201d where Q names the phenomenal quality at\nissue. It has been objected by Tye (1995) that the use of the qualia\nname \u201cQ\u201d within a propositional attitude context\ncreates the well-known problems: Replacing \u201cQ\u201d by\nanother name \u201cR\u201d for the same quale may change\nthe truth value of the belief ascription. A proponent of Lycan\u2019s view\ncould however respond along the following lines: In the case of qualia\nnames within belief contexts it does not matter which name is used to\nrefer to the quale at issue as long as the belief is meant in the\nsense of a phenomenal belief ascription. \u201cS believes\nthat it is like Q to see blue\u201d means, on the phenomenal\nreading, that S has the relevant belief about Q\nunder a phenomenal concept of Q. Under the assumption that it\nis impossible to have two different phenomenal concepts of one and the\nsame quale, the objection is met: As long as two qualia names\nQ and R refer to the same quale, replacing\nQ by R in an ascription of phenomenal belief cannot\nchange the truth value of the belief ascription.\n\nAs we have seen, proponents of the Ability Hypothesis assume that the\nknow-how which Mary acquires is distinct from any propositional\nknowledge. This assumption can be challenged, based for example on the\nwork of Jason Stanley and Timothy Williamson (2001). On this view, for\na subject S to know how to do something (to F) is for\nS to know that there is a way w for S to F,\nand for S to know this under a practical mode of presentation\n(2001, 430). Stanley & Williamson themselves apply this thought to\nLewis\u2019s version of the Ability Hypothesis:\n\nKnowing how to imagine red and knowing how to recognize red are both\nexamples of knowledge-that. For example, x\u2019s knowing how to\nimagine red amounts to knowing a proposition of the form\n\u2018w is a way for x to imagine red\u2019,\nentertained under a guise involving a practical mode of presentation\nof a way (2001, 442; see also McConnell 1994).\n\n\nYuri Cath suggests that this point can be accommodated by proponents\nof the Ability Hypothesis, provided they distinguish between Mary\u2019s\nlearning a new proposition and her coming to be in new state of\npropositional knowledge (2009, 142\u2013143). Specifically, before\nher release Mary can know that w is a way for someone to\nimagine red, but only under a theoretical mode of presentation; after\nher release, she comes to know the same proposition under a practical\nmode of presentation. She thus comes to be in a new state of\npropositional knowledge, but without learning any new\n propositions.[4]\n",
