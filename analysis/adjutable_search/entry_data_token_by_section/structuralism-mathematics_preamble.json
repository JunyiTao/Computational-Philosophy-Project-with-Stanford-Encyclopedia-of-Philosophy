    "main_text": "\n\nTwo related slogans for structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics\nare that \u201cmathematics is the general study of structures\u201d\nand that, in pursuing such study, we can \u201cabstract away from the\nnature of objects instantiating those structures\u201d. (As such,\nstructuralism stands in contrast with several other general views\nabout mathematics, including: the traditional view that mathematics is\nthe science of number and quantity; the view that it is an empty\nformalism used primarily for calculation; and the view that it is the\nstudy of a basic set-theoretic universe.) As the present survey aims\nto show, these slogans, while suggestive, are ambiguous and in need of\nclarification. Indeed, they have been interpreted in various\ndifferent, even conflicting ways.\n\nThe introduction of structuralist views in the philosophy of\nmathematics is often assumed to have happened in the 1960s, in works\nby Paul Benacerraf and Hilary Putnam; the trend picked up steam in the\n1980s\u201390s, when Michael Resnik, Stuart Shapiro, Geoffrey\nHellman, Charles Parsons, and others entered the fray; and these\ndebates have been reshaped again during the last 20 years, by several\nphilosophical challenges to structuralism and by the introduction of\nfurther variants, including category-theoretic forms of\nstructuralism. Besides introducing the reader to the general topic of\n\u201cstructuralism in the philosophy of mathematics\u201d, a second\nmain goal of the present entry will be to provide a novel, broader,\nand relatively comprehensive taxonomy for the varieties of\nstructuralism on offer today. \n",
