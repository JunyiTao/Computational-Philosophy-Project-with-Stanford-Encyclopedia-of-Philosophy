    "main_text": "Challenging Choice Situations, Problematic Preference Structures, and Dynamic Choice Problems || Incommensurable Alternatives\n1.1 Incommensurable Alternatives\n\nLet us first consider situations that involve choosing between\nincommensurable alternatives.\n\nAccording to the standard conception of incommensurability explored\nextensively by philosophers such as Joseph Raz and John Broome (see,\nfor example, Raz 1986 and Broome 2000), two alternatives are\nincommensurable if neither alternative is better than the other, nor\nare the two alternatives equally good.\n\nIt might seem as though the idea of incommensurable alternatives does\nnot really make sense. For if the value of an alternative (to a\nparticular agent) is neither higher nor lower than the value of\nanother alternative, then the values of the two alternatives must, it\nseems, be equal. But this assumes that there is a common measure that\none can use to express and rank the value of every alternative; and,\nif there are incommensurable alternatives, then this assumption is\nmistaken.\n\nNow consider the following: If all alternatives were commensurable,\nthen whenever one faced two alternatives neither of which was better\nthan the other, slightly improving one of the alternatives would, it\nseems, \u2018break the tie\u2019 and render one alternative, namely\nthe improved alternative, superior. But there seem to be cases in\nwhich there are two alternatives such that (i) neither alternative is\nbetter than the other and (ii) this feature is not changed by slightly\nimproving one of the alternatives. Consider, for example, the\nfollowing case: For Kay, neither of the following alternatives is\nbetter than the other:\n\n\n(A1) going on a six-day beach vacation with her children\n\n(A2) taking a two-month oil-painting course.\n\n\nFurthermore, although the alternative\n\n(A1+) going on a seven-day beach vacation with her children\n\n\nis a slight improvement on A1, A1+ is not better than A2.\nThis scenario seems possible, and if it is, then we have a case of\nincommensurable alternatives. For, in this case, A1 is not better than\nA2, A2 is not better than A1, and yet A1 and A2 are not equally good.\nIf A1 and A2 were equally good, then an improvement on A1, such as\nA1+, would be better than A2. But, for Kay, A1+\nis not better than A2.\n\nIt is often supposed that incommensurable alternatives must be\nincomparable. But things are complicated once it is recognized that\nthere is conceptual room for two alternatives that are not comparable\nas one better than the other or as equally good (and so are\nincommensurable according the conception of incommensurability\nidentified above) to be comparable as \u2018in the same league\u2019\nor \u2018on a par,\u2019 and thus not altogether incomparable, as\nwould be the case if there were no positive relation connecting the\noverall value of each option (see Chang 2002). For the purposes of\nthis discussion, the question of whether incommensurable alternatives\nare invariably incomparable can be put aside, since the dynamic choice\nproblem that will be discussed in relation to incommensurability\napplies regardless of whether the incommensurable options at issue are\nincomparable or are instead comparable as on a par.\n\nAlthough there is still some controversy concerning the possibility of\nincommensurable alternatives (compare, for example, Raz 1997 and Regan\n1997), there is widespread agreement that we often treat\nalternatives as incommensurable. Practically speaking, determining the\nvalue of two very different alternatives in terms of a common measure,\neven if this is possible, may be too taxing. It is thus often natural\nto treat two alternatives as though they are neither equal nor one\nbetter than the other.\n\nThe existence or appearance of incommensurable alternatives can give\nrise to dynamic choice problems. Consider Abraham\u2019s case, as\ndescribed by John Broome in his work on incommensurability:\n\nGod tells Abraham to take his son Isaac to the mountain, and there\nsacrifice him. Abraham has to decide whether or not to obey. Let us\nassume this is one of those choices where the alternatives are\nincommensur[able]. The option of obeying will show submission to God,\nbut the option of disobeying will save Isaac\u2019s life. Submitting\nto God and saving the life of one\u2019s son are such different\nvalues that they cannot be weighed determinately against each other;\nthat is the assumption. Neither option is better than the other, yet\nwe also cannot say that they are equally good. (Broome 2001, 114)\n\n\nGiven that the options of submitting to God and saving Isaac are\nincommensurable (and even if they were only incommensurable as far as\na reasonable person could tell), Abraham\u2019s deciding to submit to\nGod seems rationally permissible. So it is easy to see how\nAbraham\u2019s situation might prompt him to set out for the mountain\nin order to sacrifice Isaac. But it is also easy to see how, once at\nthe foot of the mountain, Abraham might decide to turn back. For, even\nthough, as Broome puts it, \u201cturning back at the foot of the\nmountain is definitely worse than never having set out at all\u201d\nsince \u201ctrust between father and son [has already been] badly\ndamaged\u201d (2001, 115), the option of saving Isaac by turning back\nand the option of submitting to God and sacrificing Isaac may be\nincommensurable. This becomes apparent if one recalls Kay\u2019s case\nand labels Abraham\u2019s above-mentioned options as follows:\n\n\n(B1) saving Isaac by turning back at the foot of the mountain\n\n(B1+) saving Isaac by refusing to set out for the\nmountain\n\n(B2) submitting to God and sacrificing Isaac.\n\n\nEven though B1+ is better than B1, both B1+ and\nB1 may be incommensurable with B2. But if B1 is incommensurable with\nB2, then Abraham could, once at the foot of the mountain, easily\ndecide to opt for B1 over B2. Given that B1 is worse than\nB1+, Abraham could thus easily end up with an outcome that\nis worse than another that was available to him, even if each of his\nchoices makes sense given the value of the alternatives he faces.\n\nThe moral, in general terms, is that in cases of incommensurability\n(or cases in which it is tempting to treat two alternatives as\nincommensurable), decisions that seem individually defensible can,\nwhen combined, result in a series of decisions that fit together very\npoorly relative to the agent\u2019s large-scale, ongoing\nconcerns.\n",
