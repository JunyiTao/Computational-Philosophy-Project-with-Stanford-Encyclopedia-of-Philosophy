    "main_text": "Knowledge of the Mind\n5. Knowledge of the Mind\n\n\nThe remarks just noted about \u2018bare consciousness\u2019 and so\non by no means exhaust the concerns that can be raised about Kant and\nwhat we can know about the mind. His official view has to be: nothing\n\u2014 about the mind\u2019s structure and what it is composed of, at any\nrate, we can know nothing. As we have seen, Kant not only maintained\nthis but did some ingenious wiggling to account for the apparent\ncounter-evidence. But that is not the end of the story, for two\nreasons.\n\n\nFirst, whatever the commitments of his philosophy, Kant the person\nbelieved that the soul is simple and persists beyond death; he found\nmaterialism utterly repugnant (1783, Ak. IV, end of \u00a746). This is\nan interesting psychological fact about Kant but needs no further\ndiscussion.\n\n\nSecond and more importantly, Kant in fact held that we do\nhave knowledge of the mind as it is. In particular, we know that it has\nforms of intuition in which it must locate things spatially and\ntemporally, that it must synthesize the raw manifold of intuition in\nthree ways, that its consciousness must be unified, and so on \u2014\nall the aspects of the model examined above.\n\n\nTo square his beliefs about what we cannot know and what we do know\nabout the mind, Kant could have made at least two moves. He could have\nsaid that we know these things only \u2018transcendentally\u2019,\nthat is to say, by inference to the necessary conditions of experience.\nWe do not know them directly, in some sense of \u2018directly\u2019,\nso we don\u2019t have intuitive, i.e., sense-derived knowledge of them. Or\nhe could have said that ontological neutrality about structure and\ncomposition is compatible with knowledge of function. As we saw, Kant\u2019s\nconception of the mind is functionalist\u2014to understand the mind,\nwe must study what it does and can do, its functions\u2014and the\ndoctrine that function does not dictate form is at the heart of\ncontemporary functionalism. According to functionalism, we can gain\nknowledge of the mind\u2019s functions while knowing little or nothing about\nhow the mind is built. Approached this way, Kant\u2019s view that we know\nnothing of the structure and composition of the mind would\njust be a radical version of this functionalist idea. Either move would\nrestore consistency among his various claims about knowledge of the\nmind.\n",
