    "main_text": "Philosophical Questions Surrounding Frege\u2019s Theorem || The Existence of Numbers and Truth-Values: The Julius Caesar Problem\n6.5 The Existence of Numbers and Truth-Values: The Julius Caesar Problem\n\nGiven that the proof of Frege\u2019s Theorem makes no appeal to Basic\nLaw V, some philosophers have argued Frege\u2019s best strategy for\nproducing an epistemologically-justified foundation for arithmetic is\nto replace the primitive term \\(\\epsilon F\\) with the primitive term\n\\(\\#F\\), replace Basic Law V with Hume\u2019s Principle, and argue\nthat Hume\u2019s Principle is an analytic principle of\n logic.[17]\n However, we have just seen one reason why such a strategy does not\nsuffice. The claim that Hume\u2019s Principle is an analytic\nprinciple of logic is subject to the same problem just posed for Basic\nLaw V. A reason must be given as to why the claim:\n\n\\(F \\approx G\\) \n\nimplies, as a matter of meaning, that:\n\n\\(\\#F = \\#G\\) \n\nAfter all, the statement \u201c\\(\\#F = \\#G\\)\u201d is analyzable in\na manner analogous to the way we analyzed \u201c\\(\\epsilon F =\n\\epsilon G\\)\u201d in the previous section, where we used\nRussell\u2019s theory of description to analyze the sentence (L) as\nthe sentence (D). Following that pattern, we take the primitive notion\n\\(\\mathit{Numbers}(x,F)\\) and analyze \\(\\#F = \\#G\\) as:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} &\\exists x\\exists y[\\mathit{Numbers}(x,F) \\amp\n\\forall z(\\mathit{Numbers}(z,F) \\to z\\eqclose x)\\ \\amp \\\\ &\\quad\n\\mathit{Numbers}(y,G) \\amp \\forall z (\\mathit{Numbers}(z,G) \\to\nz\\eqclose y) \\amp x\\eqclose y] \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nIt is not clear why we should think that this last claim is implied by\n\\(F \\approx G\\) as a matter of meaning. The right-to-left direction of\nHume\u2019s Principle is not obviously analytic.\n\nMoreover, Frege had his own reasons for not replacing Basic Law V with\nHume\u2019s Principle. One reason was that he thought Hume\u2019s\nPrinciple offered no answer to the epistemological question,\n\u2018How do we grasp or apprehend logical objects, such as the\nnumbers?\u2019. A second reason is that Hume\u2019s Principle is\nclearly subject to \u2018the Julius Caesar problem\u2019. Frege\nfirst raises this problem in connection with an inductive definition\nof \u2018\\(n = \\#F\\)\u2019 that he tries out in Gl,\n\u00a755. Concerning this definition, Frege says:\n\n[Gl, \u00a756:]\n\n\u2026 but we can never \u2013 to take a crude example \u2014\ndecide by means of our definitions whether any concept has the number\nJulius Caesar belonging to it, or whether that conqueror of Gaul is a\nnumber or is not. [from the Austin translation in Frege 1953]\n\n\nFrege raises this same concern again for a contextual definition that\ngives a \u2018criterion of identity\u2019 for the objects being\ndefined. In Gl \u00a766, Frege considers the\nfollowing contextual definition of \u2018the direction of line\n\\(x\\)\u2019: \n\nThe direction of line \\(a\\) = the direction of line \\(b\\) if and only\nif \\(a\\) is parallel to \\(b\\).\n\n\nWith regard to this definition, Frege says: \n\n[Gl, \u00a766:]\n\nIt will not, for instance, decide for us whether England is the same\nas the direction of the Earth\u2019s axis \u2013 if I may be\nforgiven an example which looks nonsensical. Naturally no one is going\nto confuse England with the direction of the Earth\u2019s axis; but\nthat is no thanks to our definition of direction. [from the Austin\ntranslation in Frege 1953]\n\n\nNow trouble for Hume\u2019s Principle begins to arise when we\nrecognize that it is a contextual definition that has the same logical\nform as this definition for directions. It is central to Frege\u2019s\nview that the numbers are objects, and so he believes that it\nis incumbent upon him to say which objects they are. But the\n\u2018Julius Caesar problem\u2019 is that Hume\u2019s Principle, if\nconsidered as the sole principle offering identity conditions for\nnumbers, doesn\u2019t describe the conditions under which an\narbitrary object, say Julius Caesar, is or is not to be identified\nwith the number of planets. That is, Hume\u2019s Principle\ndoesn\u2019t define the condition \u2018\\(\\#F = x\\)\u2019, for\narbitrary \\(x\\). It only offers identity conditions when \\(x\\) is an\nobject known to be a cardinal number (for then \\(x = \\#G\\), for some\n\\(G\\), and Hume\u2019s Principle tells us when \\(\\#F = \\#G\\)).\n\nIn Gl, Frege solves the problem by giving his\nexplicit definition of numbers in terms of extensions. (We described\nthis in \u00a74 above.) Unfortunately, this is only a stopgap measure,\nfor when Frege later systematizes extensions in Gg,\nBasic Law V has the same logical form as Hume\u2019s Principle and\nthe above contextual definition of directions. Frege is aware that the\nJulius Caesar problem affects Basic Law V, as the discussion in\nGg I, \u00a710 shows. In that section, he says\n(remembering that for Frege, \\(\\epsilon\\) binds object variables and\nis not a function term):\n\n[Gg I, \u00a710:]\n\n\\(\\ldots\\) this by no means fixes completely the denotation of a name\nlike \u2018\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\epsilon}\\!\\Phi(\\epsilon)\\)\u2019.\nWe have only a means of always recognizing a course-of-values if it is\ndesignated by a name like \u2018\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\epsilon}\\!\\Phi\n(\\epsilon)\\)\u2019, by which it is already recognizable as a\ncourse-of-values. But, we can neither decide, so far, whether an\nobject is a course-of-values that is not given us as such \\(\\ldots\\)\n[from the Furth translation in Frege 1967]\n\n\nIn other words, Basic Law V does not tell us the conditions under\nwhich an arbitrarily chosen object \\(x\\) may be identified with some\ngiven extension, such as \\(\\epsilon F\\).\n\nUntil recently, it was thought that Frege solved this problem in\n\u00a710 by restricting the universal quantifier \\(\\forall x\\) of his\nGg system so that it ranges only over extensions. If\nFrege could have successfully restricted this quantifier to\nextensions, then when the question arises, whether (arbitrarily\nchosen) object \\(x\\) is identical with \\(\\epsilon F\\), one could\nanswer that \\(x\\) has to be the extension of some concept, say \\( G\\),\nand that Basic Law V would then tell you the conditions under which\n\\(x\\) is identical to \\(\\epsilon F\\). On this interpretation of\n\u00a710, Frege is alleged to have restricted the quantifiers when he\nidentified the two truth values (The True and The False) with the two\nextensions that contain just these objects as members, respectively.\nBy doing this, it was thought that all of the objects in the range of\nhis quantifier \\(\\forall x\\) in Gg become extensions\nwhich have been identified as such, for the truth values were the only\ntwo objects of his system that had not been introduced as extensions\nor courses of value.\n\nHowever, recent work by Wehmeier (1999) suggests that, in \u00a710,\nFrege was not attempting to restrict the quantifiers of his system to\nextensions (nor, more generally, to courses-of-values). The extensive\nfootnote to \u00a710 indicates that Frege considered, but did not hold\nmuch hope of, identifying every object in the domain with the\nextension consisting of just that\n object.[18]\n But, more importantly, Frege later considers cases (in\nGg, Sections 34 and 35) which seem to presuppose that\nthe domain contains objects which aren\u2019t extensions. (In these\nsections, Frege considers what happens to the definition of \u2018\\(\nx\\) is a member of \\(y\\)\u2019 when \\(y\\) is not an\n extension.)[19]\n\nEven if Frege somehow could have successfully restricted the\nquantifiers of Gg to avoid the Julius Caesar problem,\nhe would no longer have been able to apply his system by extending it\nto include names of ordinary non-logical objects. For if he were to\nattempt to do so, the question, \u201cUnder what conditions is\n\\(\\epsilon F\\) identical with Julius Caesar?\u201d, would then be\nlegitimate but have no answer. That means his logical system could not\nbe used for the analysis of ordinary language. But it was just the\nanalysis of ordinary language that led Frege to his insight that a\nstatement of number is an assertion about a concept.\n",
