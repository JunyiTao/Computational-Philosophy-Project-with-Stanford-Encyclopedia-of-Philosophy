    "main_text": "What is a Truth-maker?\n1. What is a Truth-maker?\n\nTruth-makers are often introduced in the following terms (Bigelow\n1988: 125; Armstrong 1989c: 88):\n\n(Virtue-T)\na truth-maker is that in virtue of which something is true\n\n\nThe sense in which a truth-maker \u201cmakes\u201d something true is\nsaid to be different from the causal sense in which, e.g., a potter\nmakes a pot. It is added that the primary notion of a truth-maker is\nthat of a minimal one: a truth-maker for a truth-bearer\np none of whose proper parts or constituents are truth-makers\nfor p. (Whether every proposition has a minimal truth-maker\nis contentious.) We are also cautioned that even though people often\nspeak as if there is a unique truth-maker for each truth, it is\nusually the case that one truth is made true by many things\n(collectively or severally).\n\nWhether (Virtue-T) provides a satisfactory elucidation of\ntruth-making depends on whether we have a clear understanding of\n\u201cin virtue of\u201d. Some philosophers argue this notion is an\nunavoidable primitive (Rodriguez-Pereyra 2006a: 960\u20131). But\nothers are wary. Thus, for example, Bigelow finds the locution\n\u201cin virtue of\u201d both obscure and, as will see, avoidable\n\u201cwe should not rest content with an explanation which turns on\nthe notion of virtue!\u201d (Bigelow 1988). These kinds of\nconcern provides a significant motivation for establishing whether it\nis possible to elucidate the concept of truth-making in terms\nof notions that enjoy a life independently of the circle of notions to\nwhich in virtue of and truth-making belong.\n",
