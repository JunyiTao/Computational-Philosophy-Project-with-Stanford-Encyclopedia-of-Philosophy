    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\nChristian Julius Leopold Karl, Freiherr von Ehrenfels, was born in\nRodaun near Vienna. He grew up in his father\u2019s castle in Brunn\nam Walde (see Valent 2016 for more biographical details on\nEhrenfels\u2019 youth). Though he was the eldest son and accordingly\nthe rightful heir to the family estate, he decided in 1882, when he\nwas 23 years old, to give away his birthright to his younger brother\nand to devote himself entirely to philosophy, poetry, and music. At\nfirst Ehrenfels went to Vienna in 1877 to undertake agricultural\nstudies, but in the winter semester 1879/80 he enrolled at the\nuniversity where he began his studies in philosophy with Franz\nBrentano, Thomas Masaryk, and the young Alexius Meinong, while also\nattending lectures of Franz Exner, Ludwig Boltzmann, and Ernst Mach\n(Valent 2016, 179). At the same time he also began to study\ncomposition with Anton Bruckner. As an enthusiastic follower of\nRichard Wagner he was to write librettos for Wagnerian-style music\ndramas. Ehrenfels then also links his loss of\nChristian faith to the start of his academic studies and the discovery\nof Wagner (H\u00f6fer 2017, 25). In 1882 Ehrenfels undertook a\n\u201cpilgrimage\u201d to Bayreuth in order to attend the first\nperformance of Wagner\u2019s Parzifal. This visit triggered\nboth the end of his uncritical personal admiration of Wagner (though not\nof his art) and the insight that his own musical abilities were\ninadequate, ending his lessons with Bruckner (H\u00f6fer 2017, 26).\n\nAs regards Ehrenfels\u2019 philosophical pursuits, his interest in\nBrentano\u2019s philosophy gave way to a receptivity to the ideas of\nMeinong, the new young lecturer who had also studied with Brentano,\nbut who was already developing views of his own, particularly in the\ntheory of relations, which diverged from Brentano\u2019s orthodox\nteachings (see Rollinger 2008). According to Ehrenfels\u2019 later\naccount, Brentano\u2019s smooth and polished delivery did not impress\nhim nearly as much as Meinong\u2019s cumbersome search for the truth\n(Ehrenfels in PSIV, 426\u2013429). Another student who also preferred\nMeinong over Brentano was Alois H\u00f6fler (also a Wagnerian), who\nbecame a close friend of Ehrenfels after first meeting him in Brunn in\n1876 (Valent 2016, 178). Having started to lecture in Vienna only in\n1878, Meinong was awarded a position in Graz in 1882, where Ehrenfels\nfollowed him in the winter semester of 1884/1885, after a year of\nmilitary service. Ehrenfels wrote his dissertation on Relations of\nMagnitude and Numbers. A Psychological Study in Graz under\nMeinong\u2019s guidance, likely based on an extensive commentary on\nMeinong\u2019s 1882 article \u201cHume Studien II: zur\nRelationstheorie\u201d (see Ierna 2017a, 165 and Ehrenfels 2017).\nEhrenfels returned to Vienna, where he completed his Habilitation\n(a second thesis, in addition to the doctoral thesis, in order to\nqualify for a teaching position) \u201cOn Feeling and Willing\u201d\n(Ehrenfels 1887, in PSIII, 15\u201397), in which he opposed the\nBrentanian doctrine concerning emotions and also laid down the\npsychological foundation for his later theory of value.\nDespite such opposition, it must not be overlooked that\nEhrenfels\u2019 basic orientation is unquestionably Brentanian,\ninsofar as he never gives up thinking that consciousness is inwardly\nperceived and is directed at objects. He shares this psychological\nbasis for philosophy with other prominent students of Brentano, such\nas Meinong, Carl Stumpf, Anton Marty, Edmund Husserl, Kasimir\nTwardowski, and Thomas Masaryk. In addition it should be pointed out\nthat, though Ehrenfels did not accept Brentano\u2019s own peculiar\nversion of theism, he shared with Brentano a concern for the more\n\u201cspiritual\u201d side of things. There is, by contrast, hardly\nany trace of such a concern in the thought of Meinong.\nEhrenfels lectured in Vienna during the summer semesters from 1891,\nwhile travelling in the winter semesters. In 1894 he met the young\nwidow Emma von Hartmann at a meeting of the Academic Wagner\nSociety and married her in the same year. In 1896 he was awarded\na position at the University of Prague (PSII, 21 ff.) where he would\nbecome a full professor in 1899 and, despite initial misgivings,\nremain until his retirement. This of course meant that he was a\ncolleague of Marty (in large measure an orthodox follower of\nBrentano), who in fact found Ehrenfels\u2019 non-cognitivist\norientation in value theory completely reprehensible.  When Ehrenfels\nsupported hiring H\u00f6fler in Prague as a professor of pedagogy,\nthis brought him into bitter conflict with Marty, who even ascribed\n\u201cnaive egoism\u201d to him (D\u00f6lling 1999, 141; Valent\n2016, 194; Janou\u0161ek and Rollinger 2017, 314). Ehrenfels\nmaintained a close relationship with Meinong and, unlike Meinong\nhimself and H\u00f6fler, managed to stay on good terms with\nBrentano. However much Ehrenfels drew upon ideas of Meinong or anyone\nelse, however, he spent his years in Prague as an independent thinker\nand teacher. Both Franz Kafka, Felix Weltsch, and Max Brod were\nfamiliar with Ehrenfels as a teacher and found him to be a rather\ncolorful and interesting figure (see also the quotation from Emma von\nEhrenfels\u2019 biographic sketch in PSII, 26).\nAs pessimism began to grow in the early twentieth century,\nEhrenfels became increasingly concerned with reviving European culture\n(Valent 2016, \u00a7 9). According to Max Brod, Ehrenfels\u2019\nCosmogony \u201cwas a document of this generation [the\n\u201cGeneration nevertheless\u201d (Generation des\nTrotzdem)], which for the first time embodied a mood of impending\ndoom, tough without vanishing into fear\u201d (quoted from Frechette\n2017, 325). It is also in this context that he developed his ideas for\nreforming sexual ethics.  In essence he advocated polygamy for the\nsuperior men, in order to increase the population of people with\nhigher qualities. He was at the same time opposed to those who\nadvocated racial purity and was instead all in favor of mixed\nraces. He did not see Jews as a threat to the \u201cAryan race\u201d\nand in fact acknowledged their great cultural achievements (PSIII,\n262), although he did fear \u201cthe yellow peril\u201d (see\nEhrenfels 1908, Dickinson 2002). His proposal for a new sexual ethic\nin order to enhance the European stock was, however, not well\nreceived.  As the years went on, Ehrenfels himself lost enthusiasm for\nit, but was instead more concerned with developing a new religion. He\ndid not think that Christianity, with its demands for faith where\nreason could no longer be effective, was viable. The new religion was\nto be built upon a thoroughly rational dualistic principle of\ncosmogony, which also to a large extent drew upon the concept\nof Gestalt qualities that he had developed early in his\ncareer. It should also be mentioned here that Ehrenfels found the same\nconcept to be fruitful in the domain of mathematics.\nEhrenfels died just one year before Adolf Hitler, who was of course\nfanatical in advancing racial purity, came to power in Germany.\nEhrenfels was thus spared the agony of seeing the prospect of western\ncivilization becoming something diametrically opposed to his own\nvision. Unlike many a philosopher of the twentieth century, however, it\nshould be kept in mind that Ehrenfels indeed had a vision. In this\nregard he was more comparable to a Leibniz or a Hume as opposed to our\npresent-day specialists in this or that particular domain of\nphilosophical inquiry. Nevertheless, much of his philosophical work\nalso exhibits detailed analysis and rigorous argumentation and may well\nbe appreciated by contemporary philosophers who do not share his\ndriving concerns.\n",
