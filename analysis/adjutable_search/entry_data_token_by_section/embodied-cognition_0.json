The Foils and Inspirations for Embodied Cognition\n\n\nThe ontological and methodological commitments of traditional\ncomputational cognitive science, which have been in play since at\nleast the mid-Twentieth Century, are by now well understood. Early or\ninfluential applications of computationalism to cognition include\ntheories of language acquisition (Chomsky 1959), attention (Broadbent\n1958), problem solving (Newell, Shaw, and Simon 1958), attention, memory (Sternberg 1969), and perception (Marr 1982).\nCommon to all computationally-oriented research is the idea that\ncognition involves a step-wise series of events, beginning with the\ntransduction of stimulus energy into a symbolic expression, followed\nby transformations of this expression according to various rules, the\nresult of which is a particular output\u2014a grammatical linguistic\nutterance, isolation of one stream of words from another, a solution\nto a logic problem, the identification of a stimulus as being among a\nset of memorized stimuli, or a 3-D perception of the world\n\n\nThe symbolic expressions over which cognitive processes operate, as\nwell as the rules according to which these operations proceed, appear\nas representational states internal to the cognizing agent. They are\nindividuated in terms of what they are about (phonemes, light\nintensity, edges, shapes, etc.). All of this cognitive activity takes\nplace in the agent\u2019s nervous system. It is in virtue of the\nactivation of the nervous system that stimuli become encoded into a\n\u201cmentalese\u201d language of thought, akin to the programming\nlanguages found in ordinary computers; similarly, the rules dictating\nthe manipulation of symbols in the language of thought are like the\ninstructions that a C.P.U. executes in the course of carrying out a\ntask. Rather than running spread sheets or displaying Tetris pieces,\nthe computational brain produces language, or perceives the world, or\nretrieves items from memory. The methods of computational cognitive\nscience reflect these ontological commitments. Experiments are designed\nto reveal the content of representational states or to uncover the\nsteps by which mental algorithms transform input into output.\n\n\nSo pervasive has this computational conception of cognition been over\nthe past decades that many cognitive scientists would be happy to\nidentify cognition with computation, giving little thought to the\npossibility of alternatives. Certainly the great strides toward\nunderstanding cognition that the advent of computationalism has made\npossible invites the idea that computational cognitive science, if not\nthe only game in town, is likely the best. However, ecological\npsychology, which J.J. Gibson (1966; 1979) began to develop around the\ntime that computationalism came to dominate psychological practice,\nrejected nearly every plank of the information processing model of\ncognition that computational cognitive science epitomizes. More\nrecently, connectionist cognitive science has challenged the symbolist\ncommitments of computationalism even while conceding a role for\ncomputational processes. Both ecological psychology and connectionist\npsychology have played significant roles in the rise of embodied\ncognition and so a brief discussion of their points of influence is\nnecessary to understand the \u201cembodied turn.\u201d Likewise,\nsome embodied cognition researchers draw on a very different source\nfor inspiration\u2014the phenomenological tradition with special\nattention to Merleau-Ponty\u2019s contributions. The next three\nsubsections examine these various strands of influence.\n",
