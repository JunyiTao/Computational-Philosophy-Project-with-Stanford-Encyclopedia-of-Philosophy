Is Common Knowledge Attainable?\n\nLewis formulated an account of common knowledge which generates the\nhierarchy of \u2018\\(i\\) knows that \\(j\\) knows that \u2026 \\(k\\)\nknows that \\(A\\)\u2019 propositions in order to ensure that in his\naccount of convention, agents have correct beliefs about each other.\nBut since human agents obviously cannot reason their way through such\nan infinite hierarchy, it is natural to wonder whether any group of\npeople can have full common knowledge of any proposition. More\nbroadly, the analyses of common knowledge reviewed in \u00a73 would be\nof little worth to social scientists and philosophers if this common\nknowledge lies beyond the reach of human agents.\n\nFortunately for Lewis\u2019 program, there are strong arguments that\ncommon knowledge is indeed attainable. Lewis (1969) argues that the\ncommon knowledge hierarchy should be viewed as a chain of\nimplications, and not as steps in anyone\u2019s actual reasoning. He\ngives informal arguments that the common knowledge hierarchy is\ngenerated from a finite set of axioms. We saw in \u00a72 that it is\npossible to formulate Lewis\u2019 axioms precisely and to derive the\ncommon knowledge hierarchy from these axioms and a public\nevent functioning as a basis for common knowledge. Again, the\nbasic idea behind Lewis\u2019 argument is that for a set of agents,\nif a proposition \\(A\\) is publicly known among them and each agent\nknows that everyone can draw the same conclusion \\(p\\) from \\(A\\) that\nshe can, then \\(p\\) is common knowledge. These conditions are\nobviously context dependent, just as an individual\u2019s knowing or\nnot knowing a proposition is context dependent. Yet there are many\ncases where it is natural to assume that a public event generates\ncommon knowledge, because it is properly broadcast, agents in the\ngroup are in ideal conditions to perceive it, the inference from the\npublic event to the object of common knowledge is immediate, etc.\nHowever, common knowledge could fail if some of the people failed to\nperceive the public event, or if some of them believed that some of\nthe others could not understand the announcement, or hear it, or could\nnot draw the necessary inferences, and so on.\n\nIn fact, skeptical doubt about the attainability of common knowledge\nis certainly possible. A strong skeptical argument has been recently\nput forth by Lederman (2018b). Lederman builds an argument meant to\nundermine the possibility of deriving the common knowledge hierarchy,\nas done in \u00a72, on the basis of a public event or, as Lederman\ncalls it, public information. The principle that Lederman\ntargets is what he calls ideal common knowledge (or belief),\nthat is: If \\(p\\) is public information in a group \\(G\\) then \\(p\\) is\ncommon knowledge in \\(G\\), provided the agents in \\(G\\) are ideal\nreasoners. The argument rests on the privacy and interpersonal\nincomparability of mental states among agents, and although it is\noffered in terms of perceptual knowledge, its scope goes beyond\nperception to question the possibility of common knowledge tout\ncourt.\n\nLederman (2018b) uses the following scenario: Two contestants, Alice\nand Bob, observe the height of the mast of a toy sailboat (100 cm)\nthat is subsequently replaced with a randomly selected sailboat whose\nmast may be more or less tall than 100 cm. As a matter of fact, the\nmast of the selected boat is 300 cm tall. It is therefore public\ninformation that the mast is taller than 100 cm. The ideal common\nknowledge principle above, along with assumptions about Alice and\nBob\u2019s visual systems and their publicity, would entail that\nAlice and Bob have common knowledge that the mast is taller than 100\ncm, and yet Lederman\u2019s argument shows that they do not. The main\nidea is that there is some degree of approximation in how humans\nperceive, among other things, heights. Thus, for Alice it is\nepistemically compatible with the mast looking 300 cm tall to her,\nthat the mast looks somewhat shorter than 300 cm to Bob, say 299 cm.\nAlso, Alice knows that if the mast looks 299 cm tall to Bob, then it\nis epistemically compatible for him that the mast looks 298 cm tall to\nAlice. Also, Bob knows that Alice knows that if the mast looks 298 cm\ntall to Alice, then it is epistemically compatible for her that the\nmast looks 297 cm tall to Bob. The reasoning can be repeated until\nthere it is epistemically compatible for Alice and Bob that the mast\nis not taller than 100 cm, against the intuition that they have common\nknowledge that the mast is over 100 cm tall!\n\nLederman (2018b) generalizes the argument to arbitrary cases and\nsources of public information, to conclude that people never achieve\ncommon knowledge or belief. In his view, the unattainability of common\nknowledge is not a concern in terms of a possible loss of explanatory\npower for social behavior. While common knowledge and public\ninformation from which it proceeds have long been considered crucial\nfor coordinating behavior, Lederman claims that in fact coordination\nrequires neither (see the discussion of Lederman 2018a in the next\nsection.) Against Lederman, Immerman (2021) argues that the skeptical\nargument sketched here fails in a large set of circumstances, and\nhence fails to prove the unattainability of common knowledge. The key\nidea in Immerman\u2019s attempt to refute Lederman\u2019s argument\nis that there are many perceptual values that agents will not\nentertain to begin with, as if, in the original sailboat example, they\nknew that all masts within 100 and 300 cm tall had been stolen.\nAccording to Immerman, cases of such \u201cknowledge of gaps\u201d\nare not at all uncommon and their availability prevents\nLederman\u2019s argument to go through.\n\nEven if one were to reject Lederman\u2019s skeptical argument (be it\nby agreeing with Immerman\u2019s argument above, or with the argument\nby Thomason (2021) addressed in the next section, or otherwise), care\nmust be taken in ascribing common knowledge to a group of human\nagents. Common knowledge is a phenomenon highly sensitive to the\nagents\u2019 circumstances. The following section gives an example\nthat shows that in order for \\(A\\) to be a common truism for a set of\nagents, they ordinarily must perceive an event which implies \\(A\\)\nsimultaneously and publicly.\n",
