Evidence is not a set of observational sentences\nautonomous from theoretical ones, as logical positivists believed.\nEach new theory or a theoretical paradigm, as Kuhn labeled larger\ntheoretical frameworks, produces, as it were, evidence anew.\n\nThus, theoretical concepts infect the entire experimental process from\nthe stage of design and preparation to the production and analysis of\ndata. A simple example that is supposed to convincingly illustrate\nthis view are measurements of temperature with a mercury thermometer\none uses in order to test whether objects expand when their\ntemperature increases. Note that in such a case one tests the\nhypothesis by relying on the very assumption that the expansion of\nmercury indicates increase in temperature.\n\nThere may be a fairly simple way out of the vicious circle in which\ntheory and experiment are caught in this particular case of\ntheory-ladenness. It may suffice to calibrate the mercury thermometer\nwith a constant volume gas thermometer, for example, where its use\ndoes not rely on the tested hypothesis but on the proportionality of\nthe pressure of the gas and its absolute temperature (Franklin et al.\n1989).\n\nAlthough most experiments are far more complex than this toy example,\none could certainly approach the view that experimental results are\ntheory-laden on a case-by-case basis. Yet there may be a more general\nproblem with the view.\n\nBogen and Woodward (1988) argued that debate on the relationship\nbetween theory and observation overlooks a key ingredient in the\nproduction of experimental evidence, namely the experimental\nphenomena. The experimentalists distill experimental phenomena from\nraw experimental data (e.g. electronic or digital tracks in particle\ncolliders) using various tools of statistical analysis. Thus,\nidentification of an experimental phenomenon as significant (e.g. a\npeak at a particular energy of colliding beams) is free of the theory\nthat the experiment may be designed to test (e.g. the prediction of a\nparticular particle). Only when significant phenomenon has been\nidentified can a stage of data analysis begin in which the phenomenon\nis deemed to either support or refute a theory. Thus, the\ntheory-ladenness of evidence thesis fails at least in some experiments\nin physics.\n\nThe authors substantiate their argument in part through an analysis of\nexperiments that led to a breakthrough discovery of weak neutral\ncurrents. It is a type of force produced by so-called bosons \u2014\nshort-lived particles responsible for energy transfer between other\nparticles such as hadrons and leptons. The relevant peaks were\nrecognized as significant via statistical analysis of data, and later\non interpreted as evidence for the existence of the bosons.\n\nThis view and the case study have been challenged by Schindler (2011).\nHe argues that the tested theory was critical in the assessment of the\nreliability of data in the experiments with weak neutral currents. He\nalso points out that, on occasion, experimental data can even be\nignored if they are deemed irrelevant from a theoretical perspective\nthat physicists find particularly compelling. This was the case in\nexperiments with so-called zebra pattern magnetic anomalies on the\nocean floor. The readings of new apparatuses used to scan the ocean\nfloor produced intriguing signals. Yet the researchers could not\ninterpret these signals meaningfully or satisfyingly distinguish them\nfrom noise unless they relied on some theoretical account of both the\nstructure of the ocean floor and the earth\u2019s magnetic field.\n\nKaraca (2013) points out that a crude theory-observation distinction\nis particularly unhelpful in understanding high-energy physics\nexperiments. It fails to capture the complexity of relevant\ntheoretical structures and their relation to experimental data.\nTheoretical structures can be composed of background, model, and\nphenomenological theories. Background theories are very general\ntheories (e.g. quantum field theory or quantum electrodynamics) that\ndefine the general properties of physical particles and their\ninteractions. Models are specific instances of background theories\nthat define particular particles and their properties. While\nphenomenological theories develop testable predictions based on these\nmodels.\n\nNow, each of these theoretical segments stands in a different\nrelationship to experimental data\u2014the experiments can be laden\nby a different segment to a different extent. This requires a nuanced\ncategorization of theory-ladeness, from weak to strong.\n\nThus, an experimental apparatus can be designed to test a very\nspecific theoretical model. UA1 and UA2 detectors at CERN\u2019s\nSuper Proton Synchrotron were designed to detect particles only in a\nvery specific energy regime in which W and Z bosons of the Standard\nModel were expected to exist.\n\nIn contrast, exploratory experiments approach phenomena without\nrelying on a particular theoretical model. Thus, sometimes a\ntheoretical framework for an experiment consists of phenomenological\ntheory alone. Karaca argues that experiments with deep-inelastic\nelectron-proton scattering in the late 1960s and early 1970s are\nexample of such weakly theory-laden experiments. The application of\nmerely phenomenological parameters in the experiment resulted in the\nvery important discovery of the composite rather than point-like\nstructure of hadrons (protons and neutrons), or the so-called scaling\nlaw. And this eventually led to a successful theoretical model of the\ncomposition of hadrons, namely quantum chromodynamics, or the\nquark-model of strong interactions.\n",
