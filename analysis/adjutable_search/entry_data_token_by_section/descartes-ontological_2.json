    "main_text": "The Distinction between Essence and Existence\n3. Objections and Replies\n\n\nBecause of its simplicity, Descartes\u2019 version of the ontological\nargument is commonly thought to be cruder and more obviously fallacious\nthan the one put forward by Anselm in the eleventh century. But when\nthe complete apparatus of the Cartesian system is brought forth, the\nargument proves itself to be quite resilient, at least on its own\nterms. Indeed, Descartes\u2019 version is superior to his predecessor\u2019s\ninsofar as it is grounded in a theory of innate ideas and the doctrine\nof clear and distinct perception. These two doctrines inoculate\nDescartes from the charge made against Anselm, for example, that the\nontological argument attempts to define God into existence by\narbitrarily building existence into the concept of a supremely perfect\nbeing. In the Third Meditation, the meditator discovers that her idea\nof God is not a fiction that she has conveniently invented but\nsomething native to the mind. As we shall see below, these two\ndoctrines provide the resources for answering other objections as\nwell.\n\n\nGiven our earlier discussion concerning the non-logical status of\nthe ontological argument, it may seem surprising that Descartes would\ntake objections to it seriously. He should be able to dismiss most\nobjections in one neat trick by insisting on the non-logical nature of\nthe demonstration. This is especially true of the objection that the\nontological argument begs the question. If God\u2019s existence is\nultimately self-evident and known by a simple intuition of the mind,\nthen there are no questions to be begged. Unfortunately, not all of the\nobjections to the ontological argument can be dismissed so handily, for\nthe simple reason that they do not all depend on the assumption that we\nare dealing with a formal proof.\n\n\nAlthough it is often overlooked, many of the best known criticisms\nof the ontological argument were put to Descartes by official objectors\nto the Meditations. He in turn responded to these objections\n\u2014 sometimes in lengthy replies \u2014 though many contemporary readers\nhave found his responses opaque and unsatisfying. We can better\nunderstand his replies and, in some cases, improve upon them by\nappealing to discussions from previous sections.\n\n\nOne classical objection to the ontological argument, which was first\nleveled by Gaunilo against Anselm\u2019s version of the proof, is that it\nmakes an illicit logical leap from the mental world of concepts to the\nreal world of things. The claim is that even if we were to concede that\nnecessary existence is inseparable from the idea of God (in Kant\u2019s\nterms, even if necessary existence were analytic of the concept \u201cGod\u201d),\nnothing follows from this about what does or does not exist in the\nactual world. Johannes Caterus, the author of the First Set of\nObjections to the Meditations, puts the point as follows:\n[6] Even if it is granted that a supremely perfect being\ncarries the implication of existence in virtue of its very title, it\nstill does not follow that the existence in question is anything actual\nin the real world; all that follows is that the concept of existence is\ninseparably linked to the concept of a supreme being. So you cannot\ninfer that the existence of God is anything actual unless you suppose\nthat the supreme being actually exists; for then it will actually\ncontain all perfections, including the perfection of real existence (AT\n7:99; CSM 2:72).\n\n\nTo meet this challenge, Descartes must explain how he \u201cbridges\u201d the\ninferential gap between thought and reality. The principle of clear and\ndistinct perception is intended to do just that. According to this\nprinciple, for which he argues in the Fourth Meditation, whatever one\nclearly and distinctly perceives or understands is true \u2014 true not\njust of ideas but of things in the real world represented by those\nideas. Thus, Descartes\u2019 commitment to the principle of clear and\ndistinct perception allows him to elude another objection that had\nhaunted Anselm\u2019s version of the argument.\n\n\nThe previous objection is related to another difficulty raised by\nCaterus. In order to illustrate that the inference from the mental to\nthe extra-mental commits a logical error, critics have observed that if\nsuch inferences were legitimate then we could proliferate ontological\narguments for supremely perfect islands, existing lions, and all sorts\nof things which either do not exist or whose existence is contingent\nand thus should not follow a priori from their concept. The\ntrick is simply to build existence into the concept. So, while existence\ndoes not follow from the concept of lion as such, it does\nfollow from the concept of an \u201cexisting lion.\u201d\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 actual reply to this objection, which he took very\nseriously, is highly complex and couched in terms of a theory of \u201ctrue\nand immutable natures.\u201d We can simplify matters by focusing on its key\nelements. One of his first moves is to introduce a point that we\ndiscussed earlier (see passage [5] in section 2),\nnamely that existence is contained in the idea of every thing that we\nclearly and distinctly perceive: possible (or dependent) existence is\ncontained in our clear and distinct idea of every finite thing and\nnecessary (or independent) existence is uniquely contained in the idea\nof God (AT 7:117; CSM 2:83). So for Descartes one does not have to\nbuild existence into the idea of something if that idea is clear and\ndistinct; existence is already included in every clear and distinct\nidea. But it does not follow that the thing represented by such an idea\nactually exists, except in the case of God. We cannot produce\nontological arguments for finite things for the simple reason that the\nclear and distinct ideas of them contain merely dependent existence.\nActual existence is demanded only by the idea of God, which uniquely\ncontains independent existence.\n\n\nA natural rejoinder to this reply would be to ask about the idea of\na lion having not possible but wholly necessary existence. If\nDescartes\u2019 method of reasoning were valid, it would seem to follow from\nthis idea that such a creature exists. This formulation of the\nobjection requires Descartes\u2019 second and deeper point, which is only\nhinted at in his official reply. This is that the idea of a lion \u2014 let\nalone the idea of a lion having necessary existence \u2014 is hopelessly\nobscure and confused. As Descartes says, the nature of a lion is \u201cnot\ntransparently clear to us\u201d (Axiom 10, Second Replies; AT 7:117; CSM\n2:84). Since this idea is not clear and distinct, the method of\ndemonstration employed in the ontological argument does not apply to\nit. Recall that the geometrical method of demonstration is grounded in\nthe principle of clear and distinct perception and consists in drawing\nout the contents of our clear and distinct ideas. If an idea is not\nclear and distinct then we cannot draw any conclusions from it about\nthings outside thought.\n\n\nThe key difference then between the idea of God on the one hand and\nthe idea of a necessarily existing lion is that the former can be\nclearly and distinctly perceived. For Descartes, it is just a brute\nfact that certain ideas can be clearly and distinctly perceived and\nothers cannot. Some critics have charged him with dogmatism in this\nregard. Why should Descartes be allowed to legislate the scope of our\nclear and distinct perceptions? Perhaps we can clearly and distinctly\nperceive something that he could not.\n\n\nDescartes cannot be saved entirely from this charge, but two\nimportant points can be made in his defense. First, he has principled\nreasons for thinking that everyone has the same set of innate or clear\nand distinct ideas. When the meditator first proved God\u2019s existence in\nthe Third Meditation, she also established that God is supremely good\nand hence no deceiver. One consequence of God\u2019s perfect benevolence is\nthat he implanted the same set of innate ideas in all finite minds.\nThus, Descartes feels justified in concluding that the limits of his\ncapacity for clear and distinct perception will be shared by\neveryone.\n\n\nSecond, when responding to objections to the ontological argument\nsuch as the ones considered above, Descartes typically does more than\ninsist dogmatically on a unique set of clear and distinct ideas. He\nalso tries to dispel the confusion which he thinks is at the root of\nthe objection. Since the ontological argument ultimately reduces to an\naxiom, the source of an objection according to Descartes\u2019 diagnosis is\nthe failure of the objector to perceive this axiom clearly and\ndistinctly. Thus, Descartes devotes the bulk of his efforts to trying\nto remove those philosophical prejudices which are hindering his\nobjector from intuiting the axiom. These efforts are not always\nobvious, however. Descartes is good at maintaining the pretense of\nanswering criticisms to a formal proof. But his replies to Caterus\u2019\nobjections to the ontological argument are best read as an extended\neffort to dispel prejudice and confusion, so as to enable his reader to\nintuit God\u2019s existence for himself.\n\n\nLet us return for a moment to the objection that the ontological\nargument slides illicitly from the mental to the extramental realm. We\nhave seen how Descartes responds to it, but it is related to another\nobjection that has come to be associated with Leibniz. Leibniz claims\nthat Descartes\u2019 version of the ontological argument is incomplete. It\nshows merely that if God\u2019s existence is possible or non-contradictory,\nthen God exists.  But it fails to demonstrate the antecedent of this\nconditional (Robert Adams 1998, 135). To reinforce this objection, it\nis sometimes observed that the divine perfections (omnipotence,\nomniscience, benevolence, eternality, etc.) might be inconsistent with\none another.  This objection is related to the previous one in that\nthe point in both cases is that Descartes\u2019 argument restricts us to\nclaims about the concept of God and lacks existential import. In order\nto redress this issue himself, Leibniz formulates a different version\nof the ontological argument (see Adams 1998, 141f).\n\n\nDescartes was dead long before Leibniz articulated this criticism but\nit was familiar to him from the Second Set of Objectors (Marin\nMersenne et al.) (AT 7:127; CSM 2:91). He replies by\nappealing once again to the principle of clear and distinct\nperception, which states that if something is contained in the clear\nand distinct idea of something then it is not only possible but also\ntrue of that thing in reality. (Descartes might have said that if\nsomething is conceivable then it is possible, and a being having all\nperfections is conceivable, but he has an even stronger principle at\nhis disposal in the rule for truth.) In effect, Descartes thinks he\nhas already satisfied Mersenne and Leibniz\u2019s extra condition.  But\nMersenne\u2019s version of the objection goes further, urging that in order\nto know with certainty that God\u2019s nature is possible, one must have an\nadequate idea that encompasses all of the divine attributes and the\nrelations between them (ibid.) \u2014 something that Descartes denies\nthat we have. Descartes responds to this criticism as follows:\n\n [7] For as far as our concepts are concerned there is no\n impossibility in the nature of God; on the contrary, all the\n attributes which we include in the concept of the divine nature are\n so interconnected that it seems to us to be self-contradictory that\n any one of them should not belong to God (AT 7:151; CSM\n 2:107).\n\n\nIt is difficult to see how this statement on its own addresses\nMersenne\u2019s criticism, but here again we can gain a better grip on what\nDescartes has in mind by appealing to our earlier discussion in\nsection 2. We noted there that on Descartes\u2019 view there is merely a\nrational distinction between a substance and each of its attributes,\nand between any two attributes of a single substance. He also\nmaintains that God has only attributes and no modes or accidental\nproperties. This implies that there is merely a rational distinction\nbetween all of the divine perfections, something that he expressly\naffirms in his correspondence (see, e.g., AT 4:349; CSMK 3:280). In\nthe Third Meditation he also notes that \u201cthe unity, simplicity,\nor the inseparability of all the divine attributes of God is one of\nthe most important of the perfections which I understand him to\nhave\u201d (AT 7:50; CSM 2:34). So not only is there no inconsistency\nbetween the divine perfections, but we understand that one of the most\nimportant perfections is simplicity (contra Curley 2005), which is\njust to say that in God there is no distinction between his\nattributes: God\u2019s omnipotence just is his omniscience, which just is\nhis benevolence, etc. The very distinction between the divine\nattributes is confined to our thought or reason. This then is what he\nmeans by saying in passage [7] that the divine attributes are\n\u201cinterconnected,\u201d which echoes a remark in the Third\nMeditation passage concerning \u201cthe interconnection and\ninseparability of the perfections\u201d (ibid.). Descartes\u2019 responses\nprobably would not have satisfied Leibniz and Mersenne, but we can\nappreciate how they have a fundamental basis in his philosophical\nsystem.\n\n\nPerhaps the most famous objection to the ontological argument is that\nexistence is not a property or predicate. Popularized by Kant, this\nobjection enjoys the status of a slogan known by every undergraduate\nphilosophy major worth her salt. In claiming that existence is\nincluded in the idea of a supremely perfect being, along with all the\nother divine attributes, Descartes\u2019 version of the argument appears to\nsuccumb to this objection.\n\n\nIt is not obvious of course that existence is not a\npredicate. To convince us of this point, Kant observes that there is\nno intrinsic difference between the concept of a hundred real thalers\n(coins common in Kant\u2019s time) and the concept of a hundred possible\nthalers. Whenever we think of anything, we regard it as\nexisting, even if the thing in question does not actually exist. Thus,\nexistence does not add anything to the concept of a thing. What then\nis existence if not a predicate? Kant\u2019s answer is that existence is\n\u201cmerely the positing of a thing\u201d or \u201cthe copula of a\njudgment,\u201d the point being that when we say \u201cGod\nexists\u201d we are simply affirming that there is an object\nanswering to the concept of God. We are not ascribing any new\npredicates to God, but merely judging that there is a subject, with\nall its predicates, in the world (CPR:B626\u201327).\n\n\nKant\u2019s formulation of the objection was later refined by Bertrand\nRussell in his famous theory of descriptions. He argues that\nexistential statements such as \u201cGod exists\u201d are misleading\nas to their logical form. While serving grammatically as a predicate,\nthe term \u201cexists\u201d in this sentence has a much different\nlogical function, which is revealed only by analysis. Properly\nanalyzed, \u201cGod exists\u201d means \u201cthere is one (and only\none) x such that \u2018x is omnipotent, omniscient, etc.\u2019 is\ntrue.\u201d Russell thinks this translation shows that, appearances\nto the contrary, the statement \u201cGod exists\u201d is not\nascribing existence to a subject, but asserting that a certain\ndescription (in single quotes) applies to something in reality.\nRussell\u2019s view is reflected in the standard modern logical treatment\nof existence as a quantifier rather than a predicate.\n\n\nIt is widely believed that Descartes did not have a response to this\nobjection, indeed that he blithely assumed that existence is a\nproperty without ever considering the matter carefully. But this is\nnot the case. The seventeenth-century empiricist Pierre Gassendi\nconfronted Descartes with this criticism in the Fifth Set of\nObjections (and deserves credit for being the first to enunciate it):\n\u201cexistence is not a perfection either in God or in anything\nelse; it is that without which no perfections can be present\u201d\n(AT 7:323; CSM 2:224). As with most of his replies to Gassendi (whom\nhe regarded as a loathsome materialist and quibbler), Descartes\nresponded somewhat curtly. But it is clear from the discussion in\nsection 2 that he had the resources for addressing this objection in a\nsystematic manner.\n\n\nBefore examining how Descartes might defend himself, it is important\nto note that the question at issue is typically framed in non-Cartesian\nterms and thus often misses its target. Both Kant and Russell for\nexample are interested in the logical issue of whether existence is a\npredicate. Descartes, in contrast, was not a logician and\ndisparaged the standard subject-predicate logic inherited from\nAristotle. Although, as discussed above, he sometimes presents formal\nversions of the ontological arguments as heuristic devices, Descartes\nthought that God\u2019s existence is ultimately known through intuition.\nThis intuitive process is psychological in character. It is not a\nmatter of assigning predicates to subjects but of determining whether\nthe idea of a supremely perfect being can be clearly and distinctly\nperceived while excluding necessary existence from it through a purely\nintellectual operation. To be sure, Descartes was interested in the\nontological question of whether existence is a\n\u201cproperty\u201d of substances. For him, however, the analogues\nof properties are clear and distinct ideas and ways of regarding them,\nnot predicates.\n\n\nHaving said that, Descartes\u2019 best strategy for answering the\nontological version of the objection is to concede it, or at least\ncertain aspects of it. Descartes explicitly affirms Kant\u2019s point that\nexistence does not add anything to the idea of something (provided\nthat the terms \u201cidea\u201d and \u201cconcept\u201d are\nregarded as psychological items).  Once again we should recall passage\n[4] from the Second Replies: \u201cExistence is contained in the idea\nor concept of every single thing, since we cannot conceive of anything\nexcept as existing\u201d (Axiom 10, AT 7:166; CSM 2:117). So,\nDescartes agrees with Kant that there is no conceptual difference\nbetween conceiving of a given substance as actually existing and\nconceiving it as merely possible. In the first instance one is\nattending to the existence that is contained in every clear and\ndistinct idea, and in the other instance one is ignoring the thing\u2019s\nexistence without actively excluding it. He would, however, stress\nanother conceptual difference that Kant and other critics do not\naddress, namely that between the two grades of existence \u2014\ncontingent and necessary. The clear and distinct ideas of all finite\nthings contain merely contingent or dependent existence, whereas the\nclear and distinct idea of God uniquely contains necessary or wholly\nindependent existence (ibid.). As discussed previously, the\nontological argument hinges on this distinction.\n\n\nAnother intuition underlying the claim that existence is not a\nproperty is that there is more intimate connection between an\nindividual and its existence than the traditional one between a\nsubstance and a property, especially if the property in question is\nconceived as something accidental. If existence were accidental, then a\nthing could be without its existence, which seems absurd. It seems no\nless absurd to say that existence is a property among other properties\n(accidental or essential), for how can a thing even have properties if\nit does not exist? Descartes shares this intuition. He does not think\nthat existence is a property in the traditional sense or is even\ndistinct from the substance that is said to bear it. Recall the view\ndiscussed in section 2 that there is merely a rational distinction\nbetween a substance and its existence, or between the essence and\nexistence of a substance. This means that the distinction between a\nsubstance and its existence is confined to thought or reason. Human\nbeings, in their efforts to understand things using their finite\nintellects, draw distinctions in thought that do not obtain in reality.\nIn reality, a substance (whether created or divine) just is its\nexistence.\n\n\nThe purpose of this defense of Descartes is not to render a verdict\nas whether he has the correct account of existence, but to show that he\nhas a rather sophisticated and systematic treatment of what has been\none of the great bugbears in the history of philosophy. He does not\nmake the ad hoc assumption that existence is an attribute in\norder to serve the needs of the ontological argument. Indeed, on\nDescartes\u2019 view, existence is not a property in the traditional sense,\nnor can one conceive of something without regarding it as existing.\nDescartes\u2019 critics might not be convinced by his account of existence,\nbut then they have the burden of providing a better account. The focus\nof the debate will then be shifted to the question of who has the\ncorrect ontology, rather than whether the ontological argument is sound.\n",
