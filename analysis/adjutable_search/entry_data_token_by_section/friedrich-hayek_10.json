    "main_text": "Hayek Against Justice || The Right To Distribute\n5.2 The Right To Distribute\n\nAs noted, Hayek\u2019s critique of social justice is more\nspecifically a critique of centrally planned distribution according to\nmerit. He thinks a merit czar would be intolerable. However, what\nHayek found nightmarish about this vision clearly had more to do with\nan abhorrence of central planning than of the idea that it would be\ngood to have a way of rewarding merit. If Hayek is right that there is\nno place for centralized decisions about meritoriousness in a good\nsociety, then, contra Hayek, the implication is not that merit does\nnot matter but precisely that it does (Hayek 1976, 64). The problem\nwith merit czars in the world we know, Hayek seems to assume, is that,\nin a merit-based system, if you cannot prove you deserve G,\nthat licenses merit czars to redistribute from the less to the more\ndeserving. The point is crucial not because it refutes Hayek but\nbecause it reveals the exact nature of Hayek\u2019s real concern.\nHayek\u2019s core concern is not the mirage ofthinking merit\ndoes matter, but the mirage of thinking entitlement\n doesn\u2019t.[10]\n",
