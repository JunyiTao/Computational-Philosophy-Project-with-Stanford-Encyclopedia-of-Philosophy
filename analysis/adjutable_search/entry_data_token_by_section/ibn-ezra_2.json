    "main_text": "Impact\n3. Impact\n\n\nIbn Ezra\u2019s impact was swift and powerful. In the various communities\nthrough which he sojourned, the Arabic learning which he was able to\npresent in consumable form was widely read. As a cultural mediator,\nparticularly of astronomy and astrology, his contributions to\nChristian civilization were no less remarkable than those to his\ncoreligionists. (See, in particular, Burnett 1997.) Indeed, Ibn Ezra may\nwell be the most important cultural broker of the medieval period. His\nwritings in astrology, arithmetic, Hebrew grammar and poetics, and\nJewish thought all fall far short of the highest achievements set by\nJudaeo-Arabic culture in al-Andalus. Yet no one succeeded more than\nIbn Ezra in spreading the fruits of this culture so widely and\ndeeply.\n\n\nThis seems to be the main reason why he has secured his place in the\nhistory of Jewish philosophy. Even in those domains where he has\nrelatively much to say, for example, the theory of the soul, he draws\nupon stock notions that were widespread (especially among poets), and\nwhich by no means demonstrate a thorough education in philosophy, let\nalone the skill and propensity to philosophize. Historians of Jewish\nliturgy such as Jefim Schirmann have pointed out that Ibn Ezra was\nharping on themes that had been favorites of Jewish poets for\ngenerations. He exhibits a familiarity with many technical terms, and\non occasion broaches some issues; however, he has left us no\npenetrating discussions, or anything of the sort that would\ndemonstrate his mastery of the subject. Thus, for example, in his\ngloss to Exodus 23:30, he observes that we do not know whether the soul is\nsubstance or accident, whether it survives the death of the body, nor\nwhy it has been bonded to the body in the first place. However, one\ncan hardly find, if at all, any substantive discussions on any of\nthese three questions; he tells us nothing about the options, their\nimplications, or why the inquiry must end at an impasse.\n\n\nFor many Jews, Ibn Ezra was the spokesman of Hispano-Jewish culture,\nthe personification of the \u201cSefardi\u201d sage. His readers\nwere led to believe that the prestige of Andalusian culture stood\nbehind Ibn Ezra\u2019s pronouncements on issues such as the nature of the\nsoul or free will, and that the Torah could and should be read in a\nmanner that accommodates Ibn Ezra\u2019s views.\n\n\nIbn Ezra\u2019s use of the biblical commentary as a vehicle for the\ndissemination of his teachings was undoubtedly a major factor in his\nsuccess. His commentary (actually two are preserved for several books)\nwas a concise gloss, offering to his audiences a witty and critical\nselection of lexical and grammatical insights concerning the\n\u201cplain\u201d meaning of the text; this is the mode of\ninterpretation that he expressly endorses. Ibn Ezra spiced his\ncommentary with occasional references to a sod, meaning\neither (or both?) a secret, i.e. esoteric message ensconced in the\nbible\u2014Ibn Ezra will teasingly pull at the veil, but never remove\nit\u2014or a fundamental belief (sod thus being equivalent\nto yesod).  Ibn Ezra prefaced his commentary with a lengthy\nessay on the four improper, and the one proper, way to go about\ninterpreting the Torah. Finally, he dispersed a number of fairly long\ndigressions, self-standing essays in their own right, in which, in\nwhich he generally rehearsed the gamut of his trademark views on\ngrammar, arithmology, and astrology.\n\n \nIbn Ezra\u2019s commentary, mostly by virtue of the terse, enticing,\nyet thoroughly abstruse sodot, spawned a huge satellite\nliterature (Simon 1993; Lawee 2017). These\n\u201csupercommentaries\u201d constitute one of the major branches\nof Jewish philosophical literature of the fourteenth century. As a\nrule, they tend to interpret Ibn Ezra along similar lines,\nemphasizing, for example, astral governance and the magical aspects of\nritual. Despite the obvious disagreements, these supercommentaries\nrepeatedly argued that Ibn Ezra and Maimonides are conveying the same\nmessage (Visi 2009).\n\n\nIbn Ezra succeeded in some sense in making himself all things to all\npeople. The supercommentators as a rule find Ibn Ezra to be expounding\na univeralist, or humanitarian, philosophy that shares much with, and\ndraws much from, non-Jewish thought. On the other hand, Moses\nNahmanides, an important exegete in his own right, a very astute\nreader of texts, and a staunch opponent of Aristotle, professed his\n\u201copen hostility and concealed love\u201d for Ibn Ezra. He loved\nmany, though certainly not all, of Ibn Ezra\u2019s\n\u201chints,\u201d which Nahmanides felt were in line with his own\nkabbalistic tendencies.\n\n\nEstimations of Ibn Ezra as a philosopher peaked in the fourteenth and\nfifteenth centuries. Glosses to his Torah\ncommentary, some of them quite extensive, were written throughout the\nMediterranean basin (Simon 1993). Ibn Ezra\u2019s writings became known\nwithin Arabic speaking communities as well. At least one of these\nsupercommentaries was written in Judaeo-Arabic, and Ibn Ezra is cited,\nfor example, by Abraham Maimonides in his own commentary to the Torah.\nByzantine Jewish scholars in particular applied themselves to the\nentire corpus of Ibn Ezra\u2019s philosophical writings. Mordecai\nKhoumtianou (Comteano) wrote commentaries to Yesod Mora and\nSefer ha-Shem, doing his best to read Ibn Ezra along the\nlines of the (basically Aristotelian) philosophy that he felt most\ncomfortable with.\n\n\nLevi ben Gerson, certainly one of the most systematic and original\nthinkers in the medieval Jewish tradition, will cite Abraham Ibn Ezra\njust as respectfully as he does Moses Maimonides. Consider, for\nexample, his discussion of God\u2019s knowledge, especially the thorny\nquestion whether God knows a particular event befalling an individual\nper se, or whether He knows that event only \u201cgenerally\u201d,\nthat is, by way of His knowledge of the \u201cordering of events,\ninsofar as these events are ordered.\u201d Levi argues in favor of\nthe second option, and at the end of the chapter, suggests that both\nMaimonides and Ibn Ezra would agree with him. For Maimonides\u2019 view\nLevi can refer to the sustained discussion in Guide of the\nPerplexed 3.20; but for Ibn Ezra, he cites only the laconic\ncomment to Genesis 18:21, which states: \u201cThe truth is that He\nknows every particular generally, not as a\n particular.\u201d[1]\n It seems particularly noteworthy that Levi musters both Maimonides\nand Ibn Ezra for support for the claim that his own view does not\ncontradict the Torah; both authorities are exploited, not for their\nargumentation on the issue, but rather for their reputation as\nexegetes.\u00a0\n\n\nIbn Ezra never fell into oblivion, and his writings generated interest\nin a wide variety of cultural and historical settings.  However, there\nwere significant shifts in the perception of his place in Jewish\nthought. Thus Judah Moscato, the sixteenth century Venetian savant and\nauthor of a very learned commentary to Halevi\u2019s Kuzari,\narrays Ibn Ezra together with Gersonides against Maimonides and\nHalevi\u2014the former denying creation ex nihilo, the latter\ndefending it (Langermann 1997, 517).\n\n\nSpinoza singled out Ibn Ezra for being the first, as far as he knew,\nto question the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch (Harris 1993,\n130\u2013132). This observation greatly enhanced Ibn Ezra\u2019s stature as an\nexegete, especially among Christians. Ibn Ezra\u2019s emphasis on\npeshat, the \u201cnatural\u201d interpretation of the Bible\nfounded on philology and free of rabbinic interpretations, gained\nthereby considerable prestige. To be sure, Spinoza\u2019s view of Ibn Ezra\nwas not uniformly positive, and, for his part, Ibn Ezra makes it quite\nclear that his philological tools are not to be applied against\ntradition, but only where there is no tradition, and, especially,\nwhere no normative practices are at stake. However, as we have already\nseen, there have been wide fluctuations in the image of Ibn Ezra and\nthe interpretation of his legacy.\n\n\nThe modern Jewish philosopher most indebted to Ibn Ezra is Nachman\nKrochmal. Jay Harris has argued persuasively that \u201cKrochmal\u2019s\nunderstanding of Ibn Ezra, and his motivation for that understanding,\ncan only be understood as the fashioning of a response to the most\ninteresting and serious philosophical critique of Judaism the\nnineteenth century produced\u201d (Harris 1993, 144)\u2014that is,\nthe critiques of Hegel and Schelling. Krochmal also influenced the\nphilological side of Ibn Ezra scholarship, for example, by casting\ndoubt upon the authenticity of Arugat ha-Bosem; there is as\nyet no consensus on this issue (Greive 1973, 175\u2013177).\n",
