    "main_text": "\n\nWilliam of Auvergne or Paris, (ca.1180/90\u20131249), Bishop of Paris\nfrom 1228 until his death in 1249, was one of the first wave of\nthinkers in the Latin West to engage with the writings on natural\nphilosophy and metaphysics by Greek, Islamic and Jewish thinkers that\nhad recently become available in Latin translation. William took these\nwritings to pose errors dangerous to the Christian faith, and his\nphilosophical works are in large part aimed at combating their errors.\nYet at the same time he recognized their philosophical value and,\nthough often confused about their meaning, incorporated their\nteachings into his own thought. On many of the important issues of\nlater medieval thought, William is the first to provide in-depth\ndiscussions, and his voluminous works are an important and still\nunder-appreciated source for our understanding of the development of\nmedieval philosophy.\n",
