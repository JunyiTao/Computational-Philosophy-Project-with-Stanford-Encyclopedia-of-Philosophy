    "main_text": "Authenticity || The Power of Moods\n5.1 The Power of Moods\nFor the existentialists, the possibility of breaking free from\nengrained patterns of self-deception is generally not something that is\naccomplished by means of detached reflection. It emerges in the wake of\npowerful emotional experiences or moods. When the existentialist refers\nto feelings of \u201cnausea\u201d (Sartre), \u201cabsurdity\u201d\n(Camus), \u201canxiety\u201d (Kierkegaard), \u201cguilt\u201d\n(Heidegger), or \u201cmystery\u201d (Marcel) they are describing\nuncanny affects that have the power to shake us out of our complacency,\nwhere the secure and familiar world breaks apart and collapses, and we\nare forced to confront the question of existence. Jaspers refers to\nthese moments as \u201climit\u201d or \u201cboundary\nsituations\u201d (Grenzsituationen)\u2014situations\n\u201cwhen everything that is said to be valuable and true collapses\nbefore our eyes\u201d (1932 [1956, 117]).\nAlthough terrifying, the existentialist makes it clear that we\nshould not close our eyes or flee from these experiences because they\nare structural to the human condition. They are, as Jaspers puts it,\n\u201cimpassable, unchangeable situations that belong to human\nexistence as such\u201d (1913 [1997, 330]). Instead of turning away\nfrom this basic anxiety, the existentialist asks us to turn toward and\nface it, because it is amidst a collapsing world that the ultimate\nquestions emerge: Who am I? and What now? In this\nway, the existentialist sees the experience of anxiety and its related\nmoods as an opportunity for personal growth and transformation.\nWorld-shattering moods open me up to the possibility of being\nauthentic, of accepting and affirming the unsettling givens of my\ncondition, of being released from distractions and trivialities, and of\nrecognizing the self-defining projects that matter to me as an\nindividual.\n",
