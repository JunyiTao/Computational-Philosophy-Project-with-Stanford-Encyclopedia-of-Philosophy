The Data from Which an Implicit Concept of Legal Cause Is to Be Extracted: Fifteen Legal Facts About Cause-Based Liability in Anglo-American Tort and Criminal Law\n\nTo the definitions just mentioned, we should add the usage facts about\nhow \u201ccausation\u201d is used in resolving the problems that\narise in particular cases. This allows one to compare the\nexplicit legal definitions of causation that we have just\nsurveyed with the concept of causation implicit in the\ndecided cases. It also allows philosophers to compare their favored\nresolutions of various causal conundrums with the resolutions of those\nsame conundrums by people who have no philosophical axes to grind but\nwhose deliberations carry real world consequences with them, i.e.,\njudges. (As J.L. Austin (1957) said, philosophers may have as much to\nlearn from lawyers on such issues as causation, as lawyers do from\nphilosophers.) With considerable selectivity, some simplification, and\nlittle claim to completeness, fifteen facts are below selected as\nsalient in the legal usage of the concept of causation.\n\n1. In cases of actions rather than omissions, usually (but not\nalways\u2014see the discussion below of the action-overdetermination\ncases) if the harm did not counterfactually depend on the\ndefendant\u2019s action, then the defendant is not liable for that\nharm because he is not said to have caused it (American Law Institute\n1962).\n\n2. If the defendant\u2019s act does not increase the probability of\nsome harm occurring, and particularly if that act decreases such\nprobability, then the defendant is not liable for that harm because he\nis not said to have caused it, even if that harm\u2019s occurrence\ncounterfactually depended on the defendant\u2019s action\n(Oxendine v. State).\n\n3. With regard to liability for omissions, usually there is no\nliability for omitting to prevent some harm even in cases where there\nis counterfactual dependence of the occurrence of that harm on that\nomission; yet sometimes (the status, undertaking, and causing of peril\nexceptions) there is such liability (so long as the occurrence of the\nharm counterfactually depends on such omission; Dressler 1995:\n466\u2013467).\n\n4. With regard to liability for \u201cdouble preventions\u201d\n(where, for example, a defendant prevents a lifeguard from preventing\nanother from drowning), usually there is a supposedly cause-based\nliability for the unprevented harm in such cases because a defendant\npreventing a preventer from preventing some harm is regarded as the\ncause of that harm. Yet sometimes (for double preventions amounting to\nthe \u201callowings\u201d as conceived by the centuries-old\ndoing/allowing distinction) double preventions are treated just like\nomissions so that there is no legal causation and no liability except\nfor those exceptional circumstances (the status, undertaking, and\ncausing of peril exceptions) that exist for omission liability (Moore\n2009a: 61\u201365, 459\u2013460).\n\n5. In cases of probability-raising actions, omissions, and\ndoubly-preventative actions, there is occasionally and inconsistently\nstill no liability for harms that counterfactually depend on such\nactions, omissions, and double preventions if such harm does not also\ncounterfactually depend on that aspect of those actions, etc., that\nmade the defendant culpable.\n\n6. There is a complex pattern of liability for multiple cause cases\ninvolving actions: First, in ordinary, garden-variety concurrent cause\ncases (two or more factors individually necessary and only jointly\nsufficient for some harm), there is commonly liability even though the\ndefendant\u2019s act is but one of many causal factors producing a\nharm and such liability is full (\u201cjoint and several\u201d)\nindividual liability of such co-causing joint tort-feasors in torts\nand co-causing principals in criminal law. Second, in the symmetrical\noverdetermination variety of concurrent cause cases (where two or more\nfactors are individually sufficient and only jointly necessary for\nsome harm), there is universally liability where the acts of each of\ntwo or more culpable defendants is independently sufficient (and thus\nnot individually necessary) for the harm, and there is almost always\nliability where the sufficient condition alternative to the\ndefendant\u2019s action is not the act of another human agent but is\na natural event or condition such as an avalanche. Third, there is\nalso liability in mixed cases (\u201cmixed\u201d between\noverdetermination and garden variety concurrent cause cases in that\nthere are three or more factors, any two of which are sufficient for\nthe harm, meaning no factor is individually necessary for that harm;\nJohnson 2016). Fourth, there is also liability in asymmetrical\noverdetermination concurrent cause cases, these being cases where one\nfactor is sufficient and other factors are neither individually\nnecessary nor individually sufficient, such liability uniformly being\nimposed for the big cause (the sufficient factor) and non-uniformly\nand inconsistently being imposed for the little causes (the\ninsufficient and unnecessary factors; Wright 1985b). Fifth, in the\npre-emptive variety of multiple cause cases (where one sufficient\nfactor pre-empts another equally sufficient factor from operating on\nthis occasion), there is liability for the pre-empting sufficient\nfactor but there is no liability for the pre-empted sufficient\nfactor.\n\n7. There is also a complex pattern of liability for a harm in multiple\ncause cases involving omissions that is different than it is for\nactions, even when we restrict our gaze to omission cases where there\nis a legal duty on each omitter not to omit to prevent that harm:\nFirst, there is liability on each omitter in ordinary, garden-variety,\nconcurrent omission cases just as there is in multiple cause cases\ninvolving actions and not omissions. Second, predominantly (but not\nuniversally) there is no liability for the overdetermination\nvariety of concurrent omissions\u2014this is universally true where\none of the absences sufficient for the occurrence of the harm is\nnatural, not human, and it is predominantly true where all of the\nabsences individually sufficient for the occurrence of the harm are\nthe omissions of culpable human actors (Fisher 1992). Third, there are\nno pre-emptive omission cases because such cases are conceptually\nimpossible, and thus any liability questions here are moot (Moore\n2011b: 479\u2013482; 2013: 342\u2013348).\n\n8. There is also a complex pattern of liability for a harm in multiple\ncause cases involving double preventions rather than actions or\nomissions, and this pattern of liability is different yet again than\nit is in cases of actions or omissions: First there is liability in\nordinary, garden-variety, concurrent double-prevention cases just as\nthere is for actions and omissions. Second, there is predominantly\n(but not universally) no liability for the overdetermination\nvariety of concurrent double-preventions\u2014this is universally\ntrue where one of the doubly-preventative acts sufficient for the\noccurrence of the harm is a natural event, not a culpable human\naction, and it is predominantly true where all doubly-preventative\nacts sufficient for the occurrence of the harm are the actions of\nculpable human actors (Moore 2009a: 466\u2013467). Third, unlike in\nomission cases, there is such a thing as a pre-emptive double\nprevention case; in such cases, there is liability for the pre-empting\ndouble prevention but not for the pre-empted action that would\notherwise have been a double prevention (Moore 2011b).\n\n9. Liability exists for harms caused by a defendant even though such\nharms would not have occurred but for the victim\u2019s freakishly\nabnormal condition so long as that condition pre-existed the\ndefendant\u2019s action (this is the common law\u2019s\n\u201cthin-skulled man\u201d or \u201cyou take your victim as you\nfind him\u201d maxim).\n\n10. Yet no liability exists for harms in part caused by a defendant if\nthat harm was also in part caused by a freakishly large natural event\nthat intervened between the defendant\u2019s act and the harm that he\nin part caused (the \u201cvis major\u201d part of the\ncommon law\u2019s \u201csuperseding cause\u201d doctrine; Larremore\n1909).\n\n11. There is no liability for harms due to a \u201ccoincidence\u201d\n(defined as a freakishly unusual conjunction of events) even though\nsuch harms would not have occurred but for the defendant\u2019s\nculpable action, so long as that coincidence is not used by the\ndefendant as a means to bringing about the harm (another part of the\ncommon law\u2019s \u201csuperseding cause\u201d doctrine; Hart\n& Honor\u00e9 1959, 1985).\n\n12. Intention has supposed aphrodisiac powers to extend legally\nrelevant causal influence to what otherwise would be legally remote\nevents (the \u201cno harm is too remote if intended\u201d maxim of\nthe common law; Terry 1914: 17).\n\n13. Under the intervening human actor branch of the common law\u2019s\nsuperseding cause doctrine, there is no liability if a subsequent\nhuman actor (rather than a natural event) intervenes to \u201cbreak\nthe causal chain\u201d otherwise existing (because of counterfactual\ndependence) between the harm and the defendant\u2019s earlier act,\nwhere that intervening actor:\n\n Acts subsequently to defendant\u2019s act, and is thus not a\nco-causer of the harm.\n Does an act that is causally significant with respect to the\nharm.\n Acts independently of any motive to so act supplied by the\ndefendant.\n Acts with great culpability in bringing about the harm (usually\nintentionally or sometimes recklessly, but not merely negligently,\nwith respect to the harm).\n Acts voluntarily in the narrow, technical sense of the law,\nnamely, the relevant bodily movements are not reflexive, done while\nasleep, unconscious, in shock, under hypnosis, or otherwise not the\nproduct of the defendant\u2019s will.\n Acts voluntarily in the sense that he is not coerced by threats,\nby natural necessity, or by the compunctions of legal duty.\n Is a responsible agent (not very young, insane, or very\ndrunk).\n\n\n14. The set of doctrines presupposing scalarity of the causal relation\nas that relation is used in law (moore 2009a: 65\u201376, 118\u2013123):\n\n The use of \u201cstrength of causal connection\u201d as one\nfactor (along with degrees of fault) in apportioning liability in\nmultiple cause cases in torts, of particular importance in strict\nliability cases where liability does not depend on fault (American Law\nInstitute 2010: sec. 6).\n The seeming dependence on degree of causal contribution to\nlicense use of the balance of evils defense in cases of aiding nature\nor other persons to cause harm, and in the redirection of force cases.\n The puzzling use of something like degree of causal contribution\nto license the balance of evils defense in the acceleration cases\n(cases where the defendant merely accelerates a harm that was about to\nhappen anyway.\n The \u201cpetering out\u201d of degrees of causal contribution\nin cases of simple spatio-temporal remoteness.\n\n\n15. The absence of liability in the freakish route cases even when a\nharm counterfactually depends on the defendants act, including both\ncases where the route is freakish vis-\u00e0-vis the\ndefendant\u2019s plans or expectation, and cases where the route is\nfreakish to an outside observer.\n",
