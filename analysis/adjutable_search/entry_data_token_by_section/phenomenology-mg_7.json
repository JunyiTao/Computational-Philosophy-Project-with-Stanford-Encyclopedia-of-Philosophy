    "main_text": "The Theory of Objects in the Munich and G\u00f6ttingen Circles || Objects and States of Affairs\n4. Conclusion\n\nEarly phenomenologists make up a philosophical tradition that has been\nalmost wholly overlooked by historians of twentieth century\nphilosophy. Partly building upon the ideas of Husserl and other\nphilosophers, while nevertheless also developing their own ideas\nindependently, they made contributions to as many fields as the\nphilosophy of mind, the philosophy of psychology, the philosophy of\nspeech acts, epistemology, social philosophy, axiology, and\nontology.\n\nSome of their most important contributions are accounts of the\ndistinction between presentations (perceptions and imaginations) and\nthe acts of meaning something with an expression; of affective\nphenomena, including episodic emotions and long-lasting sentiments; of\nknowledge as a direct grasp of objects and states of affairs rather\nthan any sort of belief or conviction; of the distinction between\nattitudes or stances, such as belief and emotions, on the one hand,\nand knowledge, on the other; of the distinction between motivation and\nreasons, on the one hand, and mental causality, on the other; of the\nstructure of speech acts such as promises, orders and questions; of\ncollective intentionality and its relation to social facts; and of\nvalues, our acquaintance with them, and our reactions to them. In\nontology, they developed theories of states of affairs and an account\nof modality according to which the most fundamental type of necessity\nflows from the essences or natures of objects. The fact that their\nideas have been consistently overlooked is made even more curious by\nthe fact that they write in clear German and that many of their ideas\nwere rediscovered, beyond phenomenology, during the twentieth\ncentury.\n\nUncovering the full extent of these still rather neglected resources\nis an ongoing process that promises to impact different strands of\nphilosophical debate and to substantially enrich the received picture\nof the phenomenological movement.\n\n",
