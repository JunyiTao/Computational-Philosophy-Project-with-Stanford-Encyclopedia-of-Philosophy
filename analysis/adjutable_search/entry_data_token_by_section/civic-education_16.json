    "main_text": "Modern Forms of Civic Education || Action Civics\n4.2 Action Civics\n\nSome critics (e.g., Boyte and Kari, 1996) worry that the\n\u201cservice\u201d in \u201cservice-learning\u201d reflects a\nnarrow conception of citizenship that overlooks power and agency and\nthat encourages an undemocratic distinction between the server and the\nserved.\n\nWe can think of civic action as participation that involves far more\nthan serving, voting, working or writing a letter to the editor. It\ncan take many other forms: attending and participating in political\nmeetings; organizing and running meetings, rallies, protests, fund\ndrives; gathering signatures for bills, ballots, initiatives, recalls;\nserving on local elected and appointed boards; starting or\nparticipating in political clubs; deliberating with fellow citizens\nabout social and political issues central to their lives; and pursuing\ncareers that have public value.\n\nThe National Action Civics Collaborative (NACC) unites organizations\nthat engage students in civic action as a form of civic learning.\nService is usually only one form of \u201caction.\u201d Some NACC\nmembers work in schools, but similar practices are perhaps more common\nand easier to achieve in independent, community-based organizations.\nYouth Organizing is a widespread practice that engages adolescents in\ncivic or political activities. Levinson (2012) offers a\nphilosophically sophisticated defense of a pedagogy that she calls\n\u201cguided experiential civic education\u201d and argues for its\nplace in public schools.\n",
