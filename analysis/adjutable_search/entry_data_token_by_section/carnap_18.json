    "main_text": "Logical Syntax of Language || Recent Discussion and Commentary\n5.2 Recent Discussion and Commentary\n\nMuch of the recent discussion surrounding the Syntax,\nespecially the principle of tolerance, was inspired by\nG\u00f6del\u2019s critique of Carnap, unpublished until 1995, that\nwas originally intended for the Schilpp (1963) volume on Carnap in the\nLibrary of Living Philosophers. G\u00f6del withdrew his\npaper, but six successive drafts of it were found in his\nNachlass, of which several have now been published\n(G\u00f6del 1995). It appears, from its title (\u201cIs Mathematics\nSyntax of Language?\u201d) and much of the exposition, to focus\nspecifically on the \u201csyntax\u201d thesis, or more generally on\nthe \u201clinguistic\u201d accounts of the foundations of\nmathematics deriving from Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus\n(Goldfarb 1995: 325). However, G\u00f6del himself understood that\nCarnap had meanwhile left behind that view (in its Logical\nSyntax form), and recent commentary has focused on the principle\nof tolerance (see section 1 of the supplement\n Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology\n for the details of G\u00f6del\u2019s criticism).\n\nCarnap\u2019s early-1930s syntactical method of avoiding reference\nfor terms in the philosophical metalanguage has recently been\nidentified as the first self-consciously worked-out program of what is\nnow often called \u201cinferentialism\u201d (Peregrin forthcoming),\na different form of which is especially championed by Robert Brandom\n(1994, 2000), and has been found attractive by others (e.g., Price\n2013). Though Carnap\u2019s inferentialism had different motivations\nfrom Brandom\u2019s program of \u201creference explained away\u201d\n(Brandom 1984), there is clearly at least an analogous strategy at\nwork. While Carnap himself left the syntax program in its original\nform behind when he went on to incorporate semantics into his overall\nprogram for scientific languages, the syntax episode with its\nexplicitly inferentialist agenda is now viewed by some (e.g., Chalmers\n2012, Peregrin forthcoming) an important innovation in its own right.\nSome of these commentators thus regard Carnap\u2019s later embrace of\nsemantics as a step backwards. That had also been the view of Neurath\nat the time (Uebel 2007, Mormann 1999, Carus 2019), and of Quine and\nothers later (e.g., Goldfarb & Ricketts 1992; Ricketts 1996;\nGoldfarb 1997). These criticisms are at least partly due to a\nperception that Carnap returned to a substantive conception\nof meaning such as the Wittgensteinian one he had dropped in 1931, but\nactually his conception of reference and meaning remained minimalist\nand schematic, much to the frustration of, e.g., Russell (1940; see\nPincock 2007), who sought a substantive account of the intrinsic\nnature of reference (see the supplement\n Semantics\n for further discussion).\n",
