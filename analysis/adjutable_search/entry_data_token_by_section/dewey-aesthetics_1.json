    "main_text": "Art as Experience\n2. Art as Experience\n\nAs much as there is fascinating preliminary material in his earlier\nwritings, Art as Experience raises Dewey\u2019s theorizing\nabout aesthetics and art to a new level. Not only is the density of\nthought and insight in the later work greater, but the understanding\nof the arts that it is built on is much more sophisticated compared to\nthe earlier investigations. An important event that significantly\ncontributed to the development of Dewey\u2019s aesthetic thinking was\nhis collaboration with the industrialist and art collector Albert C.\nBarnes to whom Art as Experience is dedicated. Dewey was a\nmember of the staff of the Barnes Foundation of which he was named\ndirector in 1925. Not only does Dewey quote at length from\nBarnes\u2019 writings on painting, but also many of the art examples\nin Dewey\u2019s book came from his friend\u2019s impressive art\ncollection. One of the focus points of the Barnes collection is early\nmodernist painting, and Art as Experience includes numerous\nexaminations of the paintings by the leading figures of early\nmodernism, particularly Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, August\nRenoir, and Paul C\u00e9zanne.\n\nArt as Experience forms a systematic aesthetic theory in a\nsimilar sense to such classics of twentieth century aesthetics as\nRobin George Collingwood\u2019s Principles of Art, Martin\nHeidegger\u2019s The Origins of the Work of Art, Theodor\nAdorno\u2019s Aesthetic Theory, and Monroe Beardsley\u2019s\nAesthetics: Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism. It is a\nfar more important source of inspiration and target of criticism\ncompared to Dewey\u2019s earlier texts. The following six sections\ntake a look at the main themes of Art as Experience, all of\nwhich are, in some way or another, connected to aesthetic\nexperience.\n",
