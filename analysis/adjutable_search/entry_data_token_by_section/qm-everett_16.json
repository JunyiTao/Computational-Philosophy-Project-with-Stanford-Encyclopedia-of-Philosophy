Summary\n\nEverett took his version of the Wigner\u2019s Friend story to reveal\nan inconsistency in the standard collapse formulation of quantum\nmechanics and the incompleteness of the Copenhagen interpretation. On\nhis understanding, the quantum measurement problem was that neither\ntheory could account for the sort of nested measurement that occurs in\nthe Wigner\u2019s Friend story. Pure wave mechanics clearly provides\na consistent dynamical account of how the state of the composite\nsystem evolves in the context of nested measurement. Everett\u2019s\ntask then was to explain a sense in which pure wave mechanics might be\ntaken to be empirically faithful over determinate measurement records\nthat exhibit the standard quantum-mechanical statistics.\n\nEverett\u2019s relative-state formulation of pure wave mechanics has\na number of salient virtues. It eliminates the collapse dynamics and\nhence immediately resolves the potential conflict between the standard\ntheory\u2019s two dynamical laws. It is logically consistent,\napplicable to all physical systems, and arguably as simple as a\nformulation of quantum mechanics can be. And it is empirically\nfaithful in the sense that relative sequences of records exhibiting\nthe standard quantum statistics are typical.\n\nThe empirical problems with the relative state formulation of pure\nwave mechanics are illustrated by the fact that it provides neither\nprobabilistic predictions nor expectations for one\u2019s records at\na time or in the future. There are now a number reconstructions of\npure wave mechanics that add auxiliary assumptions in order to provide\na richer account of both determinate records and quantum probability.\nThe methodological goal is to add as little as possible to get a\nsatisfactory empirical theory given one\u2019s explanatory\ndemands.\n",
