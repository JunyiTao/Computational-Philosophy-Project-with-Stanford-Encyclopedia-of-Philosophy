    "main_text": "Neo-Pragmatic Theories of Truth\n2. Neo-Pragmatic Theories of Truth\n\nPragmatic theories of truth enjoyed a resurgence in the last decades\nof the twentieth century. This resurgence was especially visible in\ndebates between Hilary Putnam (1926\u20132016) and Richard Rorty\n(1931\u20132007) though broadly pragmatic ideas were defended by\nother philosophers as well (Bacon 2012: Ch. 4). (One example is\nCrispin Wright\u2019s superassertibility theory (1992, 2001) which he\nclaims is \u201cas well equipped to express the aspiration for a\ndeveloped pragmatist conception of truth as any other candidate\u201d\n(2001: 781) though he does not accept the pragmatist label.) While\nthese \u201cneo-pragmatic\u201d theories of truth sometimes\nresembled the classical pragmatic accounts of Peirce, James, or Dewey,\nthey also differed significantly, often by framing the concept of\ntruth in explicitly epistemic terms such as assertibility or by\ndrawing on intervening philosophical developments.\n\nAt the outset, neo-pragmatism was motivated by a renewed\ndissatisfaction with correspondence theories of truth and the\nmetaphysical frameworks supporting them. Some neo-pragmatic theories\nof truth grew out of a rejection of metaphysical realism (e.g., Putnam\n1981; for background see Khlentzos 2016). If metaphysical realism\ncannot be supported then this undermines a necessary condition for the\ncorrespondence theory of truth: namely, that there be a\nmind-independent reality to which propositions correspond. Other\nneo-pragmatic approaches emerged from a rejection of\nrepresentationalism: if knowledge is not the mind representing\nobjective reality\u2014if we cannot make clear sense of how the mind\ncould be a \u201cmirror of nature\u201d to use Rorty\u2019s (1979)\nterm\u2014then we are also well-advised to give up thinking of truth\nin realist, correspondence terms. Despite these similar starting\npoints, neo-pragmatic theories took several different and evolving\nforms over the final decades of the twentieth century.\n\nAt one extreme some neo-pragmatic theories of truth seemed to endorse\nrelativism about truth (whether and in what sense they did remains a\npoint of contention). This view was closely associated with\ninfluential work by Richard Rorty (1982, 1991a,b). The rejection of\nrepresentationalism and the correspondence theory of truth could lead\nto the conclusion that inquiry is best viewed as aiming at agreement\nor \u201csolidarity\u201d, not knowledge or truth as these terms are\ntraditionally understood. This had the radical consequence of\nsuggesting that truth is no more than \u201cwhat our peers will,\nceteris paribus, let us get away with saying\u201d (Rorty\n1979: 176; Rorty [2010a: 45] admits this phrase is provocative) or\njust \u201can expression of commendation\u201d (Rorty 1991a: 23).\nNot surprisingly, many found this position deeply problematic since it\nappears to relativize truth to whatever one\u2019s audience will\naccept (Baghramian 2004: 147). A related concern is that this position\nalso seems to conflate truth with justification, suggesting that if a\nclaim meets contextual standards of acceptability then it also counts\nas true (Gutting 2003). Rorty for one often admitted as much, noting\nthat he tended to \u201cswing back and forth between trying to reduce\ntruth to justification and propounding some form of minimalism about\ntruth\u201d (1998: 21).\n\nA possible response to the accusation of relativism is to claim that\nthis neo-pragmatic approach does not aim to be a full-fledged theory\nof truth. Perhaps truth is actually a rather light-weight concept and\ndoes not need the heavy metaphysical lifting implied by putting\nforward a \u201ctheory\u201d. If the goal is not to describe what\ntruth is but rather to describe how \u201ctruth\u201d is used, then\nthese uses are fairly straightforward: among other things, to make\ngeneralizations (\u201ceverything you said is true\u201d), to\ncommend (\u201cso true!\u201d), and to caution (\u201cwhat you said\nis justified, but it might not be true\u201d) (Rorty 1998: 22; 2000:\n4). None of these uses requires that we embark on a possibly fruitless\nhunt for the conditions that make a proposition true, or for a proper\ndefinition or theory of truth. If truth is \u201cindefinable\u201d\n(Rorty 2010b: 391) then Rorty\u2019s approach should not be described as\na definition or theory of truth, relativist or otherwise.\n\nThis approach differs in some noteworthy ways from earlier pragmatic\naccounts of truth. For one thing it is able to draw on, and draw\nparallels with, a range of well-developed non-correspondence theories\nof truth that begin (and sometimes end) by stressing the fundamental\nequivalence of \u201cS is p\u201d and\n\u201c\u2018S is p\u2019 is true\u201d. These\ntheories, including disquotationalism, deflationism, and minimalism,\nsimply were not available to earlier pragmatists (though Peirce does\nat times discuss the underlying notions). Furthermore, while Peirce\nand Dewey, for example, were proponents of scientific inquiry and\nscientific processes of verification, on this neo-pragmatic approach\nscience is no more objective or rational than other disciplines: as\nRorty put it, \u201cthe only sense in which science is exemplary is\nthat it is a model of human solidarity\u201d (1991b: 39). Finally, on\nthis approach Peirce, James, and Dewey simply did not go far enough:\nthey failed to recognize the radical implications of their accounts of\ntruth, or else failed to convey these implications adequately. In turn\nmuch of the critical response to this kind of neo-pragmatism is that\nit goes too far by treating truth merely as a sign of commendation\n(plus a few other monor functions). In other words, this type of\nneo-pragmatism can be accused of going to unpragmatic extremes\n(e.g., Haack 1998; also the exchange in Rorty & Price 2010).\n\nA less extreme version of neo-pragmatism attempts to preserve\ntruth\u2019s objectivity and independence while still rejecting\nmetaphysical realism. This version was most closely associated with\nHilary Putnam, though Putnam\u2019s views changed over time (see\nHildebrand 2003 for an overview of Putnam\u2019s evolution). While\nthis approach frames truth in epistemic terms\u2014primarily in terms\nof justification and verification\u2014it amplifies these terms to\nensure that truth is more than mere consensus. For example, this\napproach might identify \u201cbeing true with being warrantedly\nassertible under ideal conditions\u201d (Putnam 2012b: 220). More\nspecifically, it might demand \u201cthat truth is independent of\njustification here and now, but not independent of all\njustification\u201d (Putnam 1981: 56).\n\nRather than play up assertibility before one\u2019s peers or\ncontemporaries, this neo-pragmatic approach frames truth in terms of\nideal warranted assertibility: namely, warranted assertibility in the\nlong run and before all audiences, or at least before all\nwell-informed audiences. Not only does this sound much less relativist\nbut it also bears a strong resemblance to Peirce\u2019s and\nDewey\u2019s accounts (though Putnam, for one, resisted the\ncomparison: \u201cmy admiration for the classical pragmatists does\nnot extend to any of the different theories of truth that Peirce,\nJames, and Dewey advanced\u201d [2012c: 70]).\n\nTo repeat, this neo-pragmatic approach is designed to avoid the\nproblems facing correspondence theories of truth while still\npreserving truth\u2019s objectivity. In the 1980s this view was\nassociated with Putnam\u2019s broader program of \u201cinternal\nrealism\u201d: the idea that \u201cwhat objects does the world\nconsist of? is a question that it only makes sense to ask\nwithin a theory or description\u201d (Putnam 1981: 49,\nemphasis in original). Internal realism was designed as an alternative\nto metaphysical realism that dispensed with achieving an external\n\u201cGod\u2019s Eye Point of View\u201d while still preserving\ntruth\u2019s objectivity, albeit internal to a given theory. (For\nadditional criticisms of metaphysical realism see Khlentzos 2016.) In\nthe mid-1990s Putnam\u2019s views shifted toward what he called\n\u201cnatural realism\u201d (1999; for a critical discussion of\nPutnam\u2019s changing views see Wright 2000). This shift came about\nin part because of problems with defining truth in epistemic terms\nsuch as ideal warranted assertibility. One problem is that it is\ndifficult to see how one can verify either what these ideal conditions\nare or whether they have been met: either one might attempt to do so\nby taking an external \u201cgod\u2019s eye view\u201d, which would\nbe inconsistent with internal realism, or one might come to this\ndetermination from within one\u2019s current theory, which would be\ncircular and relativistic. (As Putnam put it, \u201cto talk of\nepistemically \u2018ideal\u2019 connections must either be\nunderstood outside the framework of internal realism or it too must be\nunderstood in a solipsistic manner \u201d (2012d: 79\u201380).)\nSince neither option seems promising this does not bode well for\ninternal realism or for any account of truth closely associated with\nit.\n\nIf internal realism cannot be sustained then a possible fallback\nposition is \u201cnatural realism\u201d\u2014the view \u201cthat\nthe objects of (normal \u2018veridical\u2019) perception are\n\u2018external\u2019 things, and, more generally, aspects of\n\u2018external\u2019 reality\u201d (Putnam 1999: 10)\u2014which\nleads to a reconciliation of sorts with the correspondence theory of\ntruth. A natural realism suggests \u201cthat true empirical\nstatements correspond to states of affairs that actually obtain\u201d\n(Putnam 2012a: 97), though this does not commit one to a\ncorrespondence theory of truth across the board. In other words,\nnatural realism leaves open the possibility that not all true\nstatements \u201ccorrespond\u201d to a state of affairs, and even\nthose that do (such as empirical statements) do not always correspond\nin the same way (Putnam 2012c: 68\u201369; 2012a: 98). While not a\nringing endorsement of the correspondence theory of truth, at least as\ntraditionally understood, this neo-pragmatic approach is not a\nflat-out rejection either.\n\nViewing truth in terms of ideal warranted assertibility has obvious\npragmatic overtones of Peirce and Dewey. In contrast, viewing truth in\nterms of a commitment to natural realism is not so clearly pragmatic\nthough some parallels still exist. Because natural realism allows for\ndifferent types of truth-conditions\u2014some but not all statements\nare true in virtue of correspondence\u2014it is compatible with the\ntruth-aptness of normative discourse: just because ethical statements,\nfor example, do not correspond in an obvious way to ethical state of\naffairs is no reason to deny that they can be true (Putnam 2002). In\naddition, like earlier pragmatic theories of truth, this neo-pragmatic\napproach redefines correspondence: in this case, by taking a pluralist\napproach to the correspondence relation itself (Goodman 2013; see also\nHowat 2021 and Shields (forthcoming) for recent attempts to show the\ncompatibility of pragmatic and correspondence theories of truth).\n\nThese two approaches\u2014one tending toward relativism, the other\ntending toward realism\u2014represented the two main currents in late\ntwentieth century neo-pragmatism. Both approaches, at least initially,\nframed truth in terms of justification, verification, or\nassertibility, reflecting a debt to the earlier accounts of Peirce,\nJames, and Dewey. Subsequently they evolved in opposite directions.\nThe first approach, associated with Rorty, flirts with relativism and\nimplies that truth is not the important philosophical concept it has\nlong been taken to be. Here, to take a neo-pragmatic stance toward\ntruth is to recognize the relatively mundane functions this concept\nplays: to generalize, to commend, to caution and not much else. To ask\nfor more, to ask for something \u201cbeyond the here and now\u201d,\nonly commits us to \u201cthe banal thought that we might be\nwrong\u201d (Rorty 2010a: 45). The second neo-pragmatic approach,\nassociated with Putnam, attempts to preserve truth\u2019s objectivity\nand the important role it plays across scientific, mathematical,\nethical, and political discourse. This could mean simply \u201cthat\ntruth is independent of justification here and now\u201d or\n\u201cthat to call a statement of any kind\u2026true is to say that\nit has the sort of correctness appropriate to the kind of statement it\nis\u201d (2012a: 97\u201398). On this account truth points to\nstandards of correctness more rigorous than simply what our peers will\nlet us get away with saying.\n",
