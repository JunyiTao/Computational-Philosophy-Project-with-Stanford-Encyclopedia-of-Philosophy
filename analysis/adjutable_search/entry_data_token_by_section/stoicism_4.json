    "main_text": "Physical Theory || Bodies and Incorporeals\n2.1 Bodies and Incorporeals\n\nStoic ontology is radically materialist or, more precisely,\ncorporealist. According to the Stoics, only bodies exist, because only\nbodies have the capacity to act or be acted upon (Cicero, 45A; Sextus,\n45B, Nemesius, 45C). This bold stance has wide-ranging implications:\nthe soul is a body, as are its attributes, so that wisdom, too, for\nexample, is a body (see below,\n 2.9).\n This follows from the intricate make up of the world by principles\n (2.3).\n\nBodies nonetheless do not exhaust their ontology. Although only bodies\nexist, i.e. only bodies have being, the Stoics allow for entities with\na lesser, or, at any rate, distinct, ontological status, that of\n\u201csubsisting\u201d (huphistanai). This is the case of\nthe four incorporeals: time, place, void, and lekta. Of\nthese, void is perhaps the most intuitively grasped: it is\n\u201cincorporeal and intangible, neither has shape nor takes on\nshape, neither is acted upon in any respect nor acts, but is simply\nable to receive body\u201d (Cleomedes, 49C). Void is essential to the\nuniverse, not least because it surrounds it and allows for bodies to\nmove into it during the cyclical conflagrations (more on which below,\n 2.5;\n on void, see de Harven 2015). Place\u2019s incorporeal status is\nsimilarly justified insofar as it can be the receptor of body but\nlacks the power to act or be acted upon. Understanding the incorporeal\nstatus of time is trickier (for a recent treatment, see Salles 2018).\nSome of what we might consider aspects of time are uncontroversially\nbodies: day and night, or years, for example. We are also told that\nthe past and the future subsist, while the present\n\u201cobtains\u201d or \u201cis realized\u201d\n(huparchein, a term which has been the subject of much\nscholarly attention: see Goldschmidt 1972, Barnes 2007, p. 69, Bailey\n2014). One way of understanding the sense in which time is incorporeal\nis by analogy with place, as the temporal intervals through which\nbodies pass (cf. Sedley 1999, section 6). Lekta, the final\nkind of incorporeal item, seem to stand out on this list. Usually\ntranslated as \u201csayables\u201d (from legein, \u201cto\nsay\u201d), they are roughly the sorts of things that can be said or\nexpressed by linguistic expressions and form the contents of\nimpressions and thoughts. They are treated in more detail in the\nsection on logic\n (3.2),\n but they also play a role in causation\n (2.8),\n and their metaphysical status has been the subject of much debate.\nFor a recent treatment of lekta, see Bronowski 2019; see also\nFrede 1994b.\n\nIt is particularly interesting that the incorporeals are said to\n\u201csubsist\u201d (huphistanai): the nature of this\nontological status remains a puzzle. What, if anything, they depend on\nfor their subsistence is not clear. It is usually agreed that place,\nvoid, and time are mind independent, and many agree that this is also\nthe case of lekta (Long 1971 is perhaps the strongest\nproponent of the alternative view that lekta are\nmind-dependent). It is in any case generally clear that\nincorporeals together with bodies are in some way essential to the\nmakeup of the universe, and that bodies and incorporeals share the\nstatus of being \u201csomething\u201d (ti).\n",
