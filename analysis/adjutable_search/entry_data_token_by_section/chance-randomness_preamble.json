    "main_text": "\n\n\nRandomness, as we ordinarily think of it, exists when some outcomes occur haphazardly, unpredictably, or by chance. These latter three notions are all distinct, but all have some kind of close connection to probability. Notoriously, there are many kinds of probability: subjective probabilities (\u2018degrees of belief\u2019), evidential probabilities, and objective chances, to name a few (H\u00e1jek 2012), and we might enquire into the connections between randomness and any of these species of probability.\n\nIn this entry, we focus on the potential connections between randomness and chance, or physical probability. The ordinary way that the word \u2018random\u2019 gets used is more or less interchangeable with \u2018chancy\u2019, which suggests this Commonplace Thesis\u2014a useful claim to target in our discussion:\n\n(CT)\n\nSomething is random iff it happens by chance.\n\n\n\nThe Commonplace Thesis, and the close connection between randomness and chance it proposes, appears also to be endorsed in the scientific\nliterature, as in this example from a popular textbook on evolution (which also throws in the notion of unpredictability for good measure):\n\n\nscientists use chance, or randomness, to mean that when physical\ncauses can result in any of several outcomes, we cannot predict what\nthe outcome will be in any particular case. (Futuyma 2005:\n225)\n\n\nSome philosophers are, no doubt, equally subject to this unthinking\nelision, but others connect chance and randomness deliberately. Suppes\napprovingly introduces\n\n\nthe view that the universe is essentially probabilistic in character,\nor, to put it in more colloquial language, that the world is full of\nrandom happenings. (Suppes 1984: 27)\n\n\nHowever a number of technical and philosophical advances in our\nunderstanding of both chance and randomness open up the possibility\nthat the easy slide between chance and randomness in ordinary and\nscientific usage\u2014a slide that would be vindicated by the truth of\nthe Commonplace Thesis\u2014is quite misleading. This entry will\nattempt to spell out these developments and clarify the differences\nbetween chance and randomness, as well as the areas in which they\noverlap in application. It will also aim to clarify the relationship of\nchance and randomness to other important notions in the vicinity,\nparticularly determinism and predictability (themselves often subject\nto confusion).\n\n\nThere will be philosophically significant consequences if the\nCommonplace Thesis is incorrect, and if ordinary usage is misleading.\nFor example, it is intuitively plausible that if an event is truly\nrandom it cannot be explained (if it happens for a reason, it isn\u2019t truly random). It might seem then that the possibility\nof probabilistic explanation is undermined when the probabilities\ninvolved are genuine chances. Yet this pessimistic conclusion only\nfollows under the assumption, derived from the Commonplace Thesis, that\nall chancy outcomes are random. Another interesting case is the role of\nrandom sampling in statistical inference. If randomness requires\nchance, then no statistical inferences on the basis of\n\u2018randomly\u2019 sampling a large population will be valid unless\nthe experimental design involves genuine chance in the selection of\nsubjects. But the rationale for random sampling may not require chance sampling\u2014as long as our sample is representative, those\nstatistical inferences may be reliable. But in\nthat case, we\u2019d be in a curious situation where random sampling\nwouldn\u2019t have much to do with randomness, and whatever justification\nfor beliefs based on random sampling that randomness is currently\nthought to provide would need to be replaced by something else.\nA final case of considerable philosophical interest is the frequentist approach to objective probability, which claims (roughly) that the chance of an outcome is its frequency in an appropriate series of outcomes (H\u00e1jek 2012 \u00a73.4). To avoid classifying perfectly regular recurring outcomes as chancy, frequentists like von Mises (1957) proposed to require that the series of outcomes should be random, without pattern or order. Frequentism may fall with the Commonplace Thesis: if there can be chancy outcomes without randomness, both will fail.\n\n\nThe Commonplace Thesis is central to all three examples. As it is widely accepted that probabilistic explanation is legimitate, that random sampling doesn\u2019t need genuine chance (though it can help), and that frequentism is in serious trouble (H\u00e1jek 1997), there is already some some pressure on the Commonplace\nThesis. But we must subject it to closer examination to clarify\nwhether these arguments do succeed, and what exactly it means to say of\nsome event or process that it is random or chancy. Though developing\nfurther consequences of this kind is not the primary aim of this entry,\nit is hoped that what is said here may help to untangle these and other\nvexed issues surrounding chance and randomness.\n",
