    "main_text": "Applications || .4 Beyond supervenience physicalism\n5.5 Coincident Entities and the \u201cGrounding Problem\u201d\n\nIt is fairly widely held that more than one object can occupy the same\nspatio-temporal location. Such objects are said to be\nspatio-temporally coincident. The classic example is a statue,\nGoliath, and the lump of clay that constitutes it, Lumpl (see Gibbard\n1975). On one version of the story, Lumpl sits around on a shelf for a\nfew days before the sculptor shapes it into Goliath on a Thursday\nmorning. It looks like Lumpl existed on the previous Wednesday and\nthat Goliath did not, and consequently looks like Leibniz\u2019s Law\nentails that they are distinct objects. On another version of the\nstory, Lumpl and Goliath are created and destroyed at precisely the\nsame moment. Here the two do not have different temporal properties,\nbut they do have different modal ones\u2014Lumpl would still\nexist if we squashed it into a ball, but Goliath would not. Again,\nLeibniz\u2019s Law apparently entails that they are distinct. (See\nRea 1997a for many interesting papers on this issue.)\n\nThe main objection to the view that Goliath and Lumpl are distinct is\nwhat can be called \u2018the grounding problem\u2019. How can Lumpl\nand Goliath differ in their modal properties, given that they are\nalike in every other way? What grounds their difference in\npersistence conditions? In virtue of what do they have the persistence\nconditions they do?\n\nThe grounding problem is sometimes characterized in terms of\nsupervenience failure. Lumpl and Goliath differ in their persistence\nconditions without differing in their physical or categorical\nproperties (see Yablo 1987 for a discussion of categoricity). And it\nis true that many forms of supervenience fail: weak and strong\nindividual supervenience and strong global supervenience all fail. But\nthere are forms of supervenience that can hold. Both weak and\nintermediate global supervenience hold, as does (as the name suggests)\ncoincidence-friendly supervenience, and possibly other versions of\nmultiple-domain supervenience (c.f. Zimmerman 1995, Rea 1997b, Sider\n1999, Baker 2000). All of these forms hold on the plausible assumption\nthat any two regions physically/categorically just like this one will\ncontain an object with Goliath\u2019s persistence conditions, and an\nobject with Lumpl\u2019s persistence conditions.\n\nBut the crucial question is not whether any form of supervenience\nholds, but rather whether those that hold constitute a satisfactory\nanswer to the grounding problem. For a defense of the positive answer,\nsee Sider 1999; for a defense of the negative answer, see Bennett\n2004b. For a new take, see Sider 2008. \n",
