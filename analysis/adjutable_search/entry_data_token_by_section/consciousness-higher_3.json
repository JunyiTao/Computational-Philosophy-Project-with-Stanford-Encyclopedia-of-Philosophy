Higher-Order Thought Theory (1): Actualist\n\nActualist higher-order thought (HOT) theory is a proposal about the\nnature of state-consciousness in general, of which phenomenal\nconsciousness is but one species. Its main proponent has been\nRosenthal (1986, 1993, 2005). The proposal is this: a conscious mental\nstate M, of mine, is a state that is actually causing an\nactivated thought (generally a non-conscious one) that I have\nM, and causing it non-inferentially. (The qualification\nconcerning non-inferential causation will be discussed in a moment.)\nAn account of phenomenal consciousness can then be generated by\nstipulating that the mental state M should have some causal role\nand/or content of a certain distinctive sort in order to count as an\nexperience (e.g., with an analog content, perhaps), and that when\nM is an experience (or a mental image, bodily sensation, or\nemotional feeling), it will be phenomenally conscious when (and only\nwhen) suitably targeted. The HOT is typically of the form: \u2018I am\nin mental state M.\u2019\n\nWe therefore have the following proposal to consider:\n\nActualist Higher-Order Thought Theory:\n\nA phenomenally conscious mental state is a state of a certain sort\n(e.g. with analog/non-conceptual intentional content, perhaps) which\nis the object of a higher-order thought, and which causes that thought\nnon-inferentially.\n\n\nAs noted earlier, Rosenthal interprets the non-inferential requirement\nas ruling out only conscious inferences in the generation of\na consciousness-making higher-order thought. This enables him to avoid\nhaving to say that my unconscious motives become conscious when I\nlearn of them under psychoanalysis, or that my jealousy is conscious\nwhen I learn of it by noticing and interpreting my own behavior. But\nRosenthal (2005) thinks that\nunconscious self-interpretation is acceptable as a source of\nthe conscious status of the states thereby attributed. So if I arrive\nat the thought that I am feeling cheerful by unconsciously noticing the\nspring in my own step and the smile on my own face and drawing an\nunconscious inference, my cheerfulness will thereby have been rendered\nconscious. This aspect of Rosenthal\u2019s actualist form of\nHOT theory would appear to be optional for a HOT theorist,\nhowever.\n\nIn addition, and more controversially, Rosenthal (2005) thinks that\nthe occurrence of a suitably caused HOT is sufficient for\nconsciousness, even in the absence of any targeted first-order state\n(usually called \u2018targetless\u2019 or \u2018empty\u2019\nHOTs). So I am undergoing a conscious experience of red provided that\nI think that I am undergoing an experience of red, even if I\nam actually in no first-order perceptual state whatever. This aspect\nof Rosenthal\u2019s view, too, appears optional for an actualist HOT\ntheorist. Such a theorist can\u2014and perhaps should\u2014insist\nthat phenomenally conscious experience occurs when and only when a\nfirst-order perceptual state causes a higher-order thought in the\nexistence of that state in a way that doesn\u2019t depend upon\nself-interpretation. In recent years, the twin problems\nof misrepresentation between HOTs and their first-order\ntargets as well as targetless HOT cases has led to\nsignificant disagreement among HOT theorists (see section 7\nbelow).  \n\nThe actualist HOT account avoids some of the difficulties inherent in\ninner-sense theory, while retaining the latter\u2019s ability to\nexplain the distinction between conscious and unconscious perceptions.\n(Conscious perceptions will be analog states that are targeted by a\nHOT, whereas perceptions such as those involved in blindsight or\nsubliminal perceptions will be unconscious by virtue of not\nbeing so targeted.) In particular, it is easy to see a function for\nHOTs, in general, and to tell a story about their likely evolution. A\ncapacity to entertain HOTs about experiences would enable a creature\nto negotiate the is/seems distinction, perhaps learning not to trust\nits own experiences in certain circumstances, and also to induce\nappearances in others, by deceit. And a capacity to entertain HOTs\nabout mental states (such as beliefs and desires) would enable a\ncreature to reflect on, and to alter, its own beliefs and patterns of\nreasoning, as well as to predict and manipulate the thoughts and\nbehaviors of others. Indeed, it can plausibly be claimed that it is\nour capacity to target higher-order thoughts on our own mental states\nthat underlies our status as rational agents (Burge 1996; Sperber\n1996; Rolls 2004).\n\nA common initial objection to HOT theory (or even HOP) is that they\nlead to an infinite regress.  It might seem that an infinite regress\nresults because a conscious mental state (M) must be accompanied by a\nHOT, which, in turn must be accompanied by another HOT and so\non. However, the standard and widely accepted reply or explanation is\nthat when M is conscious, the HOT is not itself conscious (Rosenthal\n1986, 2005).  M is a first-order world-directed conscious state, such\nas a desire or perception, accompanied by an unconscious HOT. But when\nthe HOT is itself conscious, there is a yet another higher-order (or\nthird-order) thought directed at the conscious HOT. This would be a\ncase of introspection according to HOT theory such that\none\u2019s attention is directed inward at M (such as introspecting\nmy desire). When this crucial distinction is overlooked, it can lead\nto some misguided objections such as supposing that, according to HOT\ntheory, having any conscious state (even for animals and infants)\nrequires the ability to introspect.\n\nOne objection to HOT theory is due to Dretske (1993). We are asked to\nimagine a case in which we carefully examine two line-drawings, say\n(or in Dretske\u2019s example, two patterns of differently-sized\nspots). These drawings are similar in almost all respects, but differ\nin just one aspect\u2014in Dretske\u2019s example, one of the\npictures contains a black spot that the other lacks. It is surely\nplausible that, in the course of examining these two pictures, one\nwill have enjoyed a conscious visual experience of the respect in\nwhich they differ\u2014e.g. of the offending spot.  But, as is\nfamiliar, one can be in this position while not knowing\nthat the two pictures are different, or in what way\nthey are different. In which case, since one can have a conscious\nexperience (e.g. of the spot) without being aware that one is having\nit, consciousness cannot require higher-order awareness.\n\nReplies to this objection have been made by Seager (1994), Byrne\n(1997), and Rosenthal (2005), among others. They point out that it is\none thing to have a conscious experience of the aspect that\ndifferentiates the two pictures, and quite another to consciously\nexperience that the two pictures are differentiated by that aspect.\nThat is, consciously seeing the extra spot in one picture needn\u2019t mean\nseeing that this is the difference between the two pictures. So while\nscanning the two pictures one will enjoy conscious experience of the\nextra spot. A HOT theorist will say that this means\nundergoing a percept with the content spot here that\nforms the target of a HOT that one is undergoing a\nperception with that content. But this can perfectly well be true\nwithout one undergoing a percept with the content spot here in\nthis picture but absent here in that one. And it can also be true\nwithout one forming any HOT to the effect that one is\nundergoing a perception with the content spot here\nwhen looking at a given picture but not when looking at the other. In\nwhich case the purported counter-example isn\u2019t really a\ncounter-example.\n\nAnother objection to actualist HOT theory is epistemological, and is\ndue to Goldman (2000). It turns crucially on the fact that the\nconsciousness-making higher-order thoughts postulated by the theory\nare, themselves, characteristically unconscious. The\nobjection goes like this. When I undergo a conscious mental state\nM, I generally know, or have good reason to believe, that\nM is conscious. But how can this be, if what\nmakes M conscious is the existence of an\nunconscious HOT targeted on M?  Since I don\u2019t\nknow that this thought exists, it seems that I shouldn\u2019t be able\nto know that M is conscious, either. As Goldman himself\nacknowledges, however, this argument can only really work on the\nassumption that actualist HOT theory is supposed to be some sort of\nanalytic or logical truth. Rosenthal has always made clear, however,\nthat the theory isn\u2019t intended to be a piece of conceptual\nanalysis, but is rather an account of the properties that\nconstitute the property of being conscious (see Rosenthal\n1986, as well as his 2005). And the epistemological argument gets no\ntraction against this sort of view.\n\nA different sort of problem with the actualist version of higher-order\nthought theory relates to the huge number of thoughts that would have\nto be caused by any given phenomenally conscious experience. (This is\nthe analogue of the \u2018computational complexity\u2019 objection\nto inner-sense theory, sketched in section 3 above). Consider just how\nrich and detailed a conscious experience can be. It would seem that\nthere can be an immense amount of which we can be consciously aware at\nany one time. Imagine looking down on a city from a window high up in\na tower-block, for example. In such a case you can have phenomenally\nconscious percepts of a complex distribution of trees, roads, and\nbuildings; colors on the ground and in the sky above; moving cars and\npedestrians; and so on. And you can\u2014it seems\u2014be conscious\nof all of this simultaneously. According to actualist HOT theory,\nthen, it seems you would need to have a distinct activated HOT for\neach distinct aspect of your experience\u2014either that, or just a\nfew such thoughts with immensely complex contents. Either way, the\nobjection is the same. For it seems implausible that all of this\nhigher-order activity should be taking place (albeit non-consciously)\nevery time someone is the subject of a complex conscious\nexperience. What would be the point? And think of the amount of\ncognitive/neural space that these thoughts would take up! (In\ncontrast, we know that neural tissue and activity are expensive; see\nAiello and Wheeler 1995; and we also know that as a result of such\nconstraints, the wiring diagram for the brain is about as efficient as\nit is possible for it to be; see Cherniak\net al. 2004.)\n\nThis objection to actualist forms of HOT theory is considered at some\nlength in Carruthers (2000), where a variety of possible replies are\ndiscussed and evaluated. Perhaps the most plausible and challenging\nsuch reply would be to deny the main premise lying behind the\nobjection, concerning the rich nature of phenomenally conscious\nexperience. The theory could align itself with Dennett\u2019s (1991)\nconception of consciousness as highly fragmented, with multiple\nstreams of perceptual content being processed in parallel in different\nregions of the brain, and with no stage at which all of these contents\nare routinely integrated into a phenomenally conscious perceptual\nmanifold. Rather, contents become conscious on a piecemeal basis, as a\nresult of internal or external\nprobing that gives rise to a HOT about the\ncontent in question. This serves to convey to us the mere illusion of riches,\nbecause wherever we direct our attention, there we find a conscious\nperceptual content. (For a related reply, see Gennaro 2012, chapter six). \n\nIt is difficult to know whether this sort of \u2018fragmentist\u2019\naccount can really explain the phenomenology of our experience,\nhowever. For it still faces the objection that the objects of\nattention can be immensely rich and varied at any given moment, hence\nrequiring there to be an equally rich and varied repertoire of HOTs\ntokened at the same time. Think of immersing yourself in the colors\nand textures of a Van Gogh painting, for example, or the scene as you\nlook out at your garden\u2014it would seem that one can be\nphenomenally conscious of a highly complex set of properties,\nwhich one could not even begin to describe or conceptualize in any\ndetail. However, since the issues here are large and controversial, it\ncannot yet be concluded that actualist forms of HOT theory have been\nrefuted. This is particularly the case when one considers such\nphenomena as change and inattentional blindness where subjects often\ndo not even notice somewhat significant changes occurring in\nan image or video even within one\u2019s focal visual field (Simons\n2000; Simons and Chabris 1999).\n\nAnother difficulty for actualist forms of HOT theory takes the form of\na puzzle: how can the targeting of a perceptual state by HOT make the\nformer \u2018light up\u2019, and acquire the properties of\n\u2018feel\u2019 or what it is like-ness?  Suppose, for\nexample, that I am undergoing an unconscious perception of red. How\ncould such a percept then acquire the properties distinctive of\nphenomenal consciousness merely by virtue of me coming to think (in\nnon-inferential fashion) that I am undergoing an experience of\nred?\n\nRosenthal (2005) replies to this objection by pointing to cases in\nwhich (he says) the acquisition and application of novel higher-order\nconcepts to our experience transforms the phenomenal properties of the\nlatter. Thus a course in wine-tasting can lead me to have experiences\nof the wine that are phenomenally quite distinct from any that I\nenjoyed previously (see also Siegel 2010; Gennaro 2012, chapter\nsix). And a course in classical music appreciation might lead to\nchanges in my experience of the sound of the orchestra, perhaps\ndistinguishing between the sounds of the oboes and the clarinets for\nthe first time. Since changes in higher-order concepts can lead to\nchanges in phenomenal consciousness, Rosenthal thinks, it is plausible\nthat it is the presence of higher-order thoughts targeting our\nperceptual states that is responsible for the latter\u2019s\nphenomenal properties tout court.\n\nIn response, an opponent of the theory might observe that some of the\nconcepts that one acquires in such cases do not appear to be\nhigher-order ones at all. Thus the concepts oaky\nand tanniny that one acquires when wine-tasting pick out\nsecondary qualities of the wine (which are first-order), not\nhigher-order properties of our experience of the wine. And likewise\nthe concept oboe when applied in an experience is a\nfirst-order concept of a sound type, not a higher-order concept of\none\u2019s experience of sound. The phenomenon here is quite general:\nacquiring and applying new concepts in one\u2019s perception can\ntransform the similarity spaces and organization of one\u2019s\nperceptual states. (Think here of the familiar duck/rabbit.) But it\nappears to be a first-order phenomenon, not a higher-order one. At any\nrate, there is considerable work for a HOT theorist to do here in\nmaking out the case to the contrary.\n",
