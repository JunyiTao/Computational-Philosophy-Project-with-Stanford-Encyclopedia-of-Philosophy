    "main_text": "The Ars || The Ternary Ars\n5.5 The Ternary Ars\n\nAfter his first visit to Paris and the criticism that ensued, in 1290\nLlull starts to make profound changes that will lead him to\nreformulate the Ars. The Ars generalis ultima,\nwritten between 1305 and 1308, and the Ars brevis, from 1308,\nestablish the most accomplished formulations of this new version of\nLlull\u2019s tool. The changes he introduced to the Ars aim\nto simplify its structure and its function through a greater\nabstraction of its figures and a reduction of its elements.\n\nA general overview of these changes include the reduction of the seven\nbasic figures\u2014A, S, T, V, X, Y, Z\u2014in the first version, to\nonly four. Particularly remarkable is the disappearance of\n Figure S,\n an essential element in the first version, as well as that of figures\nV, X, Y and Z. In the case of V, its terms will be found in other\nsections of the text. The\n Elemental Figure\n and the\n Demonstrative Figure,\n incorporated in the Ars demostrandi, are removed as well.\nThe name of the figures is changed. Instead of using letters, they are\nnow designated First, Second, Third, and Fourth. In all of them, the\nterms shown in the first versions are substituted by letters, and the\nmeanings of these letters, in each one of the figures, are found in an\n\u201calphabet\u201d. In addition, only 9 out of the 16 terms\ncontained in them remain, for the new base of the formulation of the\nArs is a ternary model, and not a quaternary one.\n",
