    "main_text": "Epistemological Views || Mitigated Skepticism\n3.3 Mitigated Skepticism\n\nClitomachus\u2019 interpretation of Carneades\u2019 skepticism was\nthe dominant view in the Academy in the period c. 130\u2013100 BCE.\nBut it was always contested, initially by Metrodorus, and later by\nPhilo himself. The basis for the alternative interpretation was a\nsecond response Carneades had given to the Stoic inactivity objection\n(position [2] in\n section 3.1\n above), arguing that it is sometimes rational to assent to\nnon-cognitive impressions (see Cicero Ac. 2.78, cf. 2.53).\nClitomachus had taken this as just an ad hominem argument,\ndesigned to challenge the Stoic defense of the view that the\noverriding principle of rationality is avoidance of any possibility of\nerror (see Cicero Ac. 2.67\u20138). Metrodorus and his\nfollowers, however, thought that this was a statement of\nCarneades\u2019 own view, and adopted it themselves.\n\nThere is no direct evidence to explain Philo\u2019s shift from\nradical to mitigated skepticism. But we can learn something about the\ngeneral motivations he may have had for adopting his new position from\nthe ways in which some mitigated skeptics understood the Carneadean\nnotion of \u201cpersuasive impressions\u201d. In the case of\nperceptual impressions, the difference between their view and the\nClitomachian position is clarified by a criticism from Philo\u2019s\nformer student Antiochus that some Academics took persuasive\nimpressions to be a criterion of truth, rather than just of\naction and philosophical criticism (see Sextus\nM\u00a07.435\u20138 and Cicero Ac. 2.32\u20136).\nThis shows that these Academics understood the mechanisms Carneades\nhad outlined for increasing the persuasiveness of impressions to\nprovide a means of confirming or disconfirming\u2014in various\ndegrees, though never ones that warranted them\nconclusively\u2014whether they were likely to be true or not. These\nmitigated skeptics thus believed that the persuasiveness of perceptual\nimpressions under the right perceptual and coherence conditions as\ndefeasible, but rational, evidence for their truth. We find a\nsimilar move in the case of non-perceptual impressions: some mitigated\nskeptics formed tentative beliefs as to which positions are more\nlikely to be true (see, e.g., Cicero Ac. 2.148), after using\nthe standard Academic practice of arguing on either side of\nphilosophical questions as a means of rationally evaluating arguments\n(see Cicero Ac. 2.7, 2.60 & On the Nature of the\nGods 1.11, Galen On the Best Method of Teaching ch. 1,\nand Plutarch Stoic Contradictions ch. 10). These mitigated\nskeptics thus changed the status of argument on either side from a\ncritical practice ending in suspension of assent into a positive\nmethod for rationally confirming and, indirectly, teaching\nphilosophical beliefs.\n\nIt is not difficult to see how this shift in the understanding of\npersuasive impressions might lead to a re-evaluation of the conception\nof rationality shared by Stoics and, at least in part, by the radical\nskeptics. Clitomachus had agreed with the Stoics that avoiding error\nis a necessary condition for rationality, and consequently, given the\napparent unavailability of knowledge, advocated suspending assent\nuniversally. But once Philo had begun to use persuasiveness as a\nrational method for evaluating impressions, the radically skeptical\nposition started to look more like an abdication of rationality than\nits paradigm. Granted that nothing can be known\u2014a view the\nmitigated skeptics continued to find extremely persuasive (see Cicero\nAc. 2.148)\u2014it still seems that we are rationally\nobliged to form the best beliefs we can, given the evidence available\nto us. And while this will involve the possibility of error, the\nrefusal to use the evidence we have seems absurd when it is\ngeneralized to every case\u2014and immoral in the case of ethics,\nsince without some regulatory beliefs, it is unlikely that our lives\ncould be virtuous or happy (see\n section 4).\n\nThese reasons, then, or something like them, led Philo, along with\nother mitigated skeptics, to the formal position that, while nothing\ncould be known (as shown by the Academic arguments against the\npossibility of cognitive impressions), it is nevertheless rational to\nassent under certain conditions, i.e., to hold beliefs based on\nreasons (Cicero Ac. 2.78). The mitigated skeptics retained\nthe Stoic characterization of such beliefs as \u201copinions\u201d\nto mark the fact that, despite the rational grounds they had for\nholding them, they were just rational beliefs\u2014i.e.,\nthey did not amount to \u201ccognitions\u201d or knowledge (Cicero\nAc. 2.148). But they also distinguished rational\nopinions of this sort from the general Stoic category of opinion as\nany assent to a non-cognitive impression (and hence as always bad), by\nqualifying their assent to them as \u201cmeasured\u201d\u2014that\nis, as provisional on their avowedly inconclusive evidence, rather\nthan as a straightforward commitment to their truth. (See the\nanonymous Introduction to Plato ch. 7 and Gellius Attic\nNights 11.5.8. Sextus mis-ascribes this view to Clitomachus in\nPH 1.226 & 1.229\u201330.)\n\nThe significant difference between this position and radical\nskepticism is clear from the principal example of a mitigatedly\nskeptical \u201copinion\u201d that we have: the thesis that nothing\ncan be known (see, e.g., Cicero Ac. 2.148, Gellius Attic\nNights 11.5.8, Galen On the Best Method for Teaching ch.\n1). The mitigated skeptics evidently believed this thesis on the\nbasis of the Academic arguments considered in\n section 3.1\n above. But this means that, despite their rejection of the existence\nof cognitive impressions and their new principle of rationality, their\nskepticism was heavily parasitic on Stoic epistemology: they accepted\na dogmatic epistemological framework, such that they believed the\nStoic theory of impressions, Stoic empiricism, the Stoic conception of\nknowledge, and so on. One does not need to see this as a weakness to\nnotice that the ties between mitigated skepticism and its dogmatic\nframework render it liable to redundancy, in a way radical skepticism\nis not, if the philosophical conception of knowledge itself\nchanges.\n",
