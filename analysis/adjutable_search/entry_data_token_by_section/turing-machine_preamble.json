    "main_text": "\n\nTuring machines, first described by Alan Turing\nin Turing 1936\u20137, are simple abstract computational devices\nintended to help investigate the extent and limitations of what can be\ncomputed. Turing\u2019s \u2018automatic machines\u2019, as he\ntermed them in 1936, were specifically devised for the computing of\nreal numbers. They were first named \u2018Turing machines\u2019 by\nAlonzo Church in a review of Turing\u2019s paper (Church 1937).\nToday, they are considered to be one of the foundational models of\ncomputability and (theoretical) computer \nscience.[1]\n",
