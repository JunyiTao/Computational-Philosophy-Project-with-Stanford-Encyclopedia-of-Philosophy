    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s View of the mind || Method\n3.1 Method\n\n\nTurning now to Kant\u2019s view of the mind, we will start with a point\nabout method: Kant held surprisingly strong and not entirely\nconsistent views on the empirical study of the mind. The empirical\nmethod for doing psychology that Kant discussed was introspection.\n\n\n\nSometimes he held such study to be hopeless. The key text on\npsychology is in The Metaphysical Foundations of Natural\nScience. There Kant tell us that \u201cthe empirical doctrine of\nthe soul \u2026 must remain even further removed than chemistry from\nthe rank of what may be called a natural science proper\u201d\n(Ak. IV:471). (In Kant\u2019s defence, there was nothing resembling a\nsingle unified theory of chemical reactions in his time.) The contents\nof introspection, in his terms inner sense, cannot be studied\nscientifically for at least five reasons.\n\n\nFirst, having only one universal dimension and one that they are\nonly represented to have at that, namely, distribution in\ntime, the contents of inner sense cannot be quantified; thus no\nmathematical model of them is possible. Second, \u201cthe manifold of\ninternal observation is separated only by mere thought\u201d. That is\nto say, only the introspective observer distinguishes the items one\nfrom another; there are no real distinctions among the items\nthemselves. Third, these items \u201ccannot be kept separate\u201d in\na way that would allow us to connect them again \u201cat will\u201d,\nby which Kant presumably means, according to the dictates of our\ndeveloping theory. Fourth, \u201canother thinking subject [does not]\nsubmit to our investigations in such a way as to be conformable to our\npurposes\u201d \u2013 the only thinking subject whose inner sense one\ncan investigate is oneself. Finally and most damningly, \u201ceven the\nobservation itself alters and distorts the state of the object\nobserved\u201d (1786, Ak. IV:471). Indeed, introspection can be bad\nfor the health: it is a road to \u201cmental illness\u201d\n(\u2018Illuminism and Terrorism\u2019, 1798, Ak. VII:133; see\n161).\n\n\nIn these critical passages, it is not clear why he didn\u2019t respect what\nhe called anthropology more highly as an empirical study of the mind,\ngiven that he himself did it. He did so elsewhere. In the\nAnthropology, for example, he links\n\u2018self-observation\u2019 and observation of others and calls\nthem both sources of anthropology (Ak. VII:142\u20133).\n\n Whatever, no kind of empirical psychology can yield necessary truths\nabout the mind. In the light of this limitation, how should\nwe study the mind? Kant\u2019s answer was: transcendental method using\ntranscendental arguments (notions introduced earlier). If we cannot\nobserve the connections among the denizens of inner sense to any\npurpose, we can study what the mind must be like and what\ncapacities and structures (in Kant\u2019s jargon, faculties) it\nmust have if it is to represent things as it does. With this\nmethod we can find universally true, that is to say,\n\u2018transcendental\u2019 psychological propositions. We have\nalready seen what some of them are: minds must be able to synthesize\nand minds must have a distinctive unity, for example. Let us turn now\nto these substantive claims.\n",
