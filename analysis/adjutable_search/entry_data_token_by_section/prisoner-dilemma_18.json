PDs and Social Networks\n\nOne way to make the idea of local interaction more realistic for some\napplications is to let agents choose the partners with whom\nto interact, based on payoffs in past interactions. Skyrms 2004\nconsiders iterated PDs among a population of unconditional cooperators\nand defectors. Initially, as usual, each agent chooses a partner at\nrandom from the remaining members of the population. For subsequent\ninteractions, however, the odds of choosing that partner are adjusted,\naccording to either the payoffs from previous times that partner was\nchosen, or (more realistically) the payoffs from previous times that\nthere has been interaction with that partner (regardless of which one\nwas \u201cchooser\u201d). In a typical PD, where the payoffs for\ntemptation, reward, punishment and sucker are 3, 2, 1 and 0, both\ncooperators and defectors eventually choose only cooperators. Since\nthe cooperators are chosen by both cooperators and defectors, they\nplay more often than the defectors who play only when they are doing\nthe choosing. If we assume that there is an equal division between\ncooperators and defectors, then cooperators can expect a return of one\nreward payoff when they are the chooser, and a fifty/fifty mix of of\nreward and sucker payoffs when they are the chosen. So their expected\npayoff for each interaction will be \\((3R+S)/2\\). Defectors can expect\na return of one temptation payoff per play, but they play half as\noften. With payoff structure indicated, \\(3R+S \\gt T\\), and so\ncooperators do better, even with this \u201cone-way\u201d\nassociation. \n\nThe story may unfold somewhat differently in what Skyrms calls an\n\u201cattenuated\u201d PD, where the payoffs are, let us say, 2.01,\n2, 1.98, and 0. (We might think of this as the \u201cJust Don't Be a\nSucker\u201d game.) Here, as before, the cooperators quickly learn\nnot to choose defectors as partners. The defectors get roughly the\nsame payoffs whether they choose cooperators or defectors as partners.\nSince they rapidly cease being chosen by cooperators, however, their\nreturns from interactions with cooperators will be less than returns\nfrom defectors and they will soon limit their choices to other\ndefectors. (It is important to understand here that the learning\nalgorithm that determines the probability I will interact with agent\n\\(\\ba\\) depends on total returns from interacting with\n\\(\\ba\\)(or total recent returns from interacting with\n\\(\\ba\\)) rather than average returns from interacting with\n\\(\\ba\\).) So in the attenuated game we end up with perfect\nassociation: defectors play defectors and cooperators play\ncooperators. Since the reward payoff slightly exceeds the punishment\npayoff, the cooperators again do better than the defectors.\n\nThe social network games considered above are not really evolutionary\nPDs in the sense described above. The patterns of interaction evolve,\nbut the strategy profile of the population remains fixed. It is\nnatural to allow both strategies and probabilities of interaction to\nevolve simultaneously as payoffs are distributed. Whether cooperation\nor defection (or neither) comes to dominate the population under such\nconditions depends on a multitude of factors: the values of the\npayoffs, the initial distribution of strategies, the relative speed of\nthe adjustments in strategy and interaction probabilities, and other\nproperties of those two evolutionary dynamics. Skyrms 2004 contains a\ngeneral discussion and a number of suggestive examples, but it does\nnot provide (or aim to provide) a comprehensive account of social\nnetwork PDs or a careful analysis of precise formulations to properly\nmodel particular phenomena. Much remains unknown.\n",
