    "main_text": "\n\nWesley Charles Salmon (1925\u20132001) was a central figure in\ntwentieth century philosophy of science. Working in the tradition of\nHume, Salmon developed a sophisticated version of empiricism combining\na genuinely probabilistic approach with realism about theoretical\nentities. Salmon\u2019s writings, characterized by a systematic and\ncrystal-clear style, cover a wide range of topics including logic, the\nphilosophy of space and time, the foundations of probability and\nscientific inference, rationality, realism, and scientific\nexplanation, a major focus of his production for more than thirty\nyears. Unlike the Hempelian \u201creceived view\u201d, Salmon\ndeveloped a concept of explanation according to which to explain means\nto exhibit the causal mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of\nphenomena. Convinced that our knowledge is uncertain and that\ncausality ought to be defined in probabilistic terms, he pursued a\nprobabilistic version of mechanicism, opening a new trend of research\nin the literature on explanation, known as\n\u201cneo-mechanicism\u201d. Salmon\u2019s views on all the topics\nhe addressed continue to nurture fresh reflection and ongoing\ndebate.\n\nAfter a biographical note (section 1), this entry surveys\nSalmon\u2019s views on probability (section 2), confirmation (section\n3), space and time (section 4), explanation and causality (section 5),\nrationality and realism (section 6). Albeit necessary in this kind of\nessay, such partitioning is somewhat artificial, because\nSalmon\u2019s ideas are strictly interconnected: his conception of\ncausal explanation relies on his frequency view of probability and\nsubstantiates a concept of rationality that regards causal knowledge\nof phenomena as crucial for our understanding of both the world and\nhuman action.\n",
