    "main_text": "Metaphysics of Mechanisms || Mechanisms and Natural Kinds\n4.4 Mechanisms and Natural Kinds\nMechanistic theories of natural kinds develop out of\nBoyd\u2019s homeostatic property cluster (HPC) view. The HPC view\nis a theory of natural kinds designed to work in domains with high\nindividual variability. The HPC view is offered as a third way between\nessentialism and nominalism about kinds in the special sciences (Boyd\n1991, 1997, 1999; Kornblith 1993; Wilson 1999, 2005; see also\nthe entry on natural kinds).\nAccording to this view, a natural kind is characterized by i) a\ncluster of properties that regularly co-occur, and ii) a similarity\ngenerating mechanism that explains why the properties in (i) tend to\nco-occur. In short, kinds are property clusters explained by\nmechanisms.\nThis view of natural kinds has been deployed to argue for taxonomic\nrevision in, for example, the biology of human emotion (Griffiths\n1997), the structure of concepts (Machery 2009), and the taxonomy of\npsychiatry (Kendler, Zachar, and Craver\n2010; see Craver 2009): a\nputatively single kind is split into multiple kinds because it is\ndiscovered that distinct properties in a property cluster are\nexplained by distinct mechanisms. This view of kinds can also be used\nto make sense of kinds that are historically transient and, in some\nways, the product of human attitudes and so socially constructed in\nthis straightforward sense; perhaps race is like this (see Kuorikoski\nand P\u00f6yh\u00f6nin 2012; Khalidi 2013).\n",
