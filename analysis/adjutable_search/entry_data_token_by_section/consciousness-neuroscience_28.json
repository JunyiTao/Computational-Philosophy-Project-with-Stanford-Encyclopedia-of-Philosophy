    "main_text": "Specific Consciousness || Neural Representation and Probabilistic Coding\n6. The Future\n\nTalk of the neuroscience of consciousness has, thus far, focused on\nthe neural correlates of consciousness. Not all neural correlates\nare explanatory, so finding correlates is a first step in the\nneuroscience of consciousness. The next step involves manipulation of\nrelevant correlates to test claims about sufficiency and necessity, as\nisolated in our two questions:\n\n\nGeneric Consciousness: What conditions/states N of\nnervous systems are necessary and (or) sufficient for a mental state,\nM, to be conscious as opposed to not?\n\nSpecific Consciousness: What neural states or properties are\nnecessary and/or sufficient for a conscious perceptual state to have\ncontent X rather than Y?\n\n\nA productive neuroscience of consciousness requires that we understand\nthe relevant neural properties at the right level of analysis. For\ngeneric consciousness, this will involve manipulation of relevant\nproperties in a way that can avoid the access/phenomenal confound, and\nrecent work focuses on pitting the many theories we have considered\nagainst each other. For specific consciousness, the critical issue\nwill be to understand neural representational content and to find ways\nto link experimentally and explanatorily neural content to phenomenal\ncontent. We have tools to manipulate neural contents to affect\nphenomenal content, and in doing so, we can begin to uncover the\nneural basis of conscious contents. There is much interesting work yet\nto be done, philosophically and empirically, and we can look forward\nto a productive interdisciplinary research program.\n",
