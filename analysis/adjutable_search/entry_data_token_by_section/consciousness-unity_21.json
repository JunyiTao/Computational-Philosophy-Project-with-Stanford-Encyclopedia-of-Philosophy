Neural Architecture of Unified Consciousness\n\nWe will conclude this article with a brief look at some philosophical\nspeculations about what the neural architecture of unified\nconsciousness might or must be like. One of the hottest issues in\ncurrent consciousness research is the issue of how brains achieve\nconsciousness and what parts of the brain are most involved in doing\ndo, what the \u2018neural correlates of consciousness\u2019 (NCC)\nare. Any real insights into the NCCs of consciousness in general are\nalso likely to contain insights into the NCCs of unified\nconsciousness. This literature is now so vast that it would take a\nwhole additional article to discuss the topic. (Koch 2004 is an\nexcellent review of the empirical neuroscience and Chalmers 2000 is\nthe most extensive exploration of the conceptual issues to date.)\nBecause of space limitations, here we will restrict ourselves to three\nof the most influential philosophical approaches to what the neural\narchitecture of consciousness might be like, those of Paul and\nPatricia Churchland (see for example Paul Churchland 1995: 214),\nDaniel Dennett (1991), and Susan Hurley (1998). \n\nThe Churchlands\u2019 view flows from a radical picture of neural\narchitecture in general. They urge that the architecture of the\nprocesses underlying cognition and consciousness consists not of\ntransformations of symbolically encoded representations, as most\nphilosophers have believed, but of something like vector\ntransformations in phase spaces. Thus on their view, neural correlates\nof unified consciousness are nothing remotely symbol- or sentence-like.\n\nDennett articulates an even more radical view, on both unity and the\narchitecture of it. For him, unified consciousness of\n\u2018self\u2019 is simply a short-lasting \u2018virtual\ncaptain\u2019 coming to be as a result of a small group of\ninformation-parcels gaining temporary dominance in a struggle with\nother such groups for control of such cognitive activities as\nself-monitoring and self-reporting. We take these transient phenomena\nto be more than they are because each of them is the \u2018me\u2019\nof the moment and they are tied to earlier transient selves by the\nspecial form of autobiographical memory identified earlier. If the\ntemporary coalition of conscious states that is winning at the moment\nis what I am, is the self, each temporal chunk of \u2018self\u2019\nis likely to be found in different parts of the brain from other such\nchunks and there will be many NCCs of unified consciousness in many\ndifferent places.\n\nIf Dennett is right, there would be reason for scepticism about what\nHurley calls the isomorphism hypothesis. The isomorphism\nhypothesis is the idea that a given kind of change in consciousness\nwill always reflect, even be the result of, a given kind of change in\nthe brain. Hurley is sceptical about it, too. One way in which\nskepticism about this hypothesis arises in her work is via\nconsideration of acallosals (people born without a corpus callosum).\nEven though the corpus callosum, when present, is the chief channel of\ncommunication between the hemispheres, acallosal people show all the\nbehavioral signs of having fully unified consciousness. If so, it has\nto be achieved by mechanisms such as cuing activity that are utterly\ndifferent from communication though a corpus callosum. And the same\ncan be true the opposite way. Different changes in consciousness can\ngo with the same changes to structure and function in the brain. And\nif both these claims are correct, then the neurological/behavioral\nbasis of unified consciousness would be very different in different\npeople. The isomorphism hypothesis would be false, attractive though\nit has been to many people.\n\nDennett\u2019s and the Churchlands\u2019 views fit naturally within\na dynamic systems view of the neural implementation of cognition and\nconsciousness, the view that unified consciousness is a result of\ncertain self-organizing activities in the brain and interactions\nbetween brain and world. Dennett thinks that, given the nature of the\nbrain, which is nothing more than neurons sending and receiving\nsignals to and from other neurons, consciousness could not take any\nform other than something like a pandemonium of competing bits of\ncontent. The Churchlands don\u2019t agree with Dennett about this.\nThey see consciousness as a state of the brain, the\n\u2018wetware\u2019, not a result of information processing, of\n\u2018software\u2019. Both sides in this debate agree that it is\nunlikely that the processes that subserve unified consciousness are\nsentence-like or language-like. \n",
