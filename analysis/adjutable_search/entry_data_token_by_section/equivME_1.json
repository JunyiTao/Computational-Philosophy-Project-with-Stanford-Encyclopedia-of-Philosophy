    "main_text": "The Physics of Mass-Energy Equivalence || Review of Mass, Momentum, and Kinetic Energy in Newtonian Physics\n1.1 Review of Mass, Momentum, and Kinetic Energy in Newtonian Physics\n\nIn Newtonian physics, a typical physical object, such as a billiard\nball, has associated with it a positive, real number called its\nmass, for which the symbol \\(m\\) is commonly used. When we\nare focusing on describing mathematically the motion of this object\nunder the action of contact forces, such as when one tries to predict\nwhere a billiard ball will go after a collision, the mass in question\nis also called the inertial mass. In the special case in\nwhich one considers how the billiard ball moves in response to\ngravity, say as it falls toward the earth, the measure of how the\nbilliard ball \u201cresponds\u201d to the gravitational field is\ncalled the gravitational mass of the object. Using\nexperiments in which he filled wooden boxes with different materials\nand suspended them from strings to construct pendulums, Newton\ndiscovered that inertial mass and gravitational mass are directly\nproportional. Physicists have since customarily treated inertial and\ngravitational mass as numerically equal. \n\nThe inertial mass in Newtonian physics (and even the gravitational\nmass) is routinely interpreted as an intrinsic property of an object.\nThe inertial mass of an object is a measure of the body\u2019s\ninertia, i.e., its tendency to resist changes to its state of motion\nin response to the action of any kind of force. Since at\nleast the late nineteenth century and Mach\u2019s criticisms of\nNewton\u2019s physics, physicists have deprecated thinking of mass as\nthe \u201cquantity of matter.\u201d \n\nThe physical intuition behind the Newtonian concept of inertial mass\nis basic if we can avail ourselves of the notion of a Newtonian force.\nGiven two bodies \\(B_1\\) and \\(B_2\\) in suitably idealized conditions,\nif it takes twice the force for \\(B_2\\) to attain the same final\nvelocity as \\(B_1\\), \\(B_2\\) has twice the mass of \\(B_1\\), i.e.,\n\\(B_2\\) has twice the inertia of \\(B_1\\). In Newtonian physics, the\ninertial mass of an object, and even its gravitational mass, can only\nchange by either physically removing a part of the object or attaching\na part to the object to make a bigger whole. \n\nTwo important quantities for describing the motion of objects in\nNewtonian physics are momentum and kinetic energy. Unlike mass, each\nof these quantities is what we might call a relational, or extrinsic,\nquantity. Although all physical objects have some value (or amount) of\nmomentum and kinetic energy, the value of each of these quantities\ndepends on the inertial reference frame relative to which one is\nmeasuring these quantities. \n\nNewton called momentum the \u201cquantity of motion,\u201d which is\nan apt label, because, very roughly, it is a measure of the extent to\nwhich an object is moving relative to an inertial reference frame. Our\ncolloquial use of the word \u201cmomentum\u201d is related to this\nintuition and to its formal definition as the product of the mass of\nan object times its velocity relative to some inertial reference\nframe. If object \\(B_2\\) has twice the mass as \\(B_1\\) but moves with\nthe same velocity relative to a reference frame, \\(B_2\\) has twice the\nmomentum. \n\nVelocity, however, is a directed quantity, because it codifies not\njust the speed \\(v\\) with which the object moves, but also its\ndirection. Velocity is formally represented by a vector\n\\(\\mathbf{v}\\), the magnitude of which is the speed of the object\n\\(v\\), which we sometimes also call the \u201cvelocity\u201d of the\nobject while allowing the context to indicate that this is elliptical\nfor \u201cthe magnitude of the velocity.\u201d Momentum is therefore\nalso a directed quantity, represented formally by a vector\n\\(\\mathbf{p}\\). To paraphrase Taylor and Wheeler (1992, p. 191), the\ndirection of momentum matters: A glancing blow is never as damaging as\none that is head on. By analogy with velocity, the magnitude of the\nmomentum is represented by the letter \\(p\\). \n\nFinally, in Newtonian mechanics, an object in motion relative to a\nreference frame also has kinetic energy, or energy of motion. Kinetic\nenergy, like all forms of energy, can be transformed into another kind\nof energy. So, for example, one could measure the kinetic energy of a\nmoving billiard ball by having it collide with a ball of soft putty or\na spring that brings the ball to rest and measuring the energy\nabsorbed by the putty or spring. There is no single standard symbol\nfor kinetic energy, though most elementary physics textbooks use\n\\(KE\\), more advanced books tend to use \\(T\\). \n\nUnlike the momentum, kinetic energy is not a directed quantity. It is,\nlike momentum, a function of the speed \\(v\\) of the object relative to\nan inertial frame. The faster an object moves relative to some\ninertial frame, the more momentum and kinetic energy it has. However,\nfor an object that is not accelerating, i.e., an object that covers\nequal spaces in equal times, one can always find an inertial reference\nframe in which both the momentum and the kinetic energy of the object\nis zero. \n\nFollowing Griffiths\u2019 approach, we might say that so far we have\nmerely defined some quantities (Griffiths 1999, p. 509 ff.). The\nphysics really lies in the three corresponding conservation principles\nassociated with these quantities: the principle of conservation of\nmass, the principle of conservation of energy, the principle of\nconservation of (linear) momentum. These principles contain the\nphysics, because each one states that a certain quantity, mass,\nenergy, or momentum, is conserved in all interactions. So, for\nexample, if we consider the collision of two billiard balls, one can\nuse the conservation of momentum to predict, given the initial motions\nand masses of the billiard balls, how they will move after the\ncollision. \n",
