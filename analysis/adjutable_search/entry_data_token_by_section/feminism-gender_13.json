    "main_text": "Beyond the Binary\n6. Conclusion\n\nThis entry first looked at feminist objections to biological\ndeterminism and the claim that gender is socially constructed. Next,\nit examined feminist critiques of prevalent understandings of gender\nand sex, and the distinction itself. In response to these concerns,\nthe entry looked at how a unified women\u2019s category could be\narticulated for feminist political purposes. This illustrated that\ngender metaphysics \u2014 or what it is to be a woman or a\nman or a genderqueer person \u2014 is still very much a live issue.\nAnd although contemporary feminist philosophical debates have\nquestioned some of the tenets and details of the original 1960s\nsex/gender distinction, most still hold onto the view that gender is\nabout social factors and that it is (in some sense) distinct\nfrom biological sex. The jury is still out on what the best, the most\nuseful, or (even) the correct definition of gender is.\n",
