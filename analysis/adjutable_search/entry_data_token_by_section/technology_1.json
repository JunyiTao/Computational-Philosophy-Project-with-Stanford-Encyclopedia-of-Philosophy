Comprehensive works such as\nVitruvius\u2019 De architectura (first century BC) and\nAgricola\u2019s De re metallica (1556) paid much attention\nto practical aspects of technology but little to philosophy.\n\nIn the realm of scholastic philosophy, there was an emergent\nappreciation for the mechanical arts. They were generally considered\nto be born of\u2014and limited to\u2014the mimicry of nature. This\nview was challenged when alchemy was introduced in the Latin West\naround the mid-twelfth century. Some alchemical writers such as Roger\nBacon were willing to argue that human art, even if learned by\nimitating natural processes, could successfully reproduce natural\nproducts or even surpass them (Newman 2004). The result was a\nphilosophy of technology in which human art was raised to a level of\nappreciation not found in other writings until the Renaissance.\nHowever, the last three decades of the thirteenth century witnessed an\nincreasingly hostile attitude by religious authorities toward alchemy\nthat culminated eventually in the denunciation Contra\nalchymistas, written by the inquisitor Nicholas Eymeric in 1396\n(Newman 2004).\n\nThe Renaissance led to a greater appreciation of human beings and\ntheir creative efforts, including technology. As a result,\nphilosophical reflection on technology and its impact on society\nincreased. Francis Bacon is generally regarded as the first modern\nauthor to put forward such reflection. His view, expressed in his\nfantasy New Atlantis (1627), was overwhelmingly positive.\nThis positive attitude lasted well into the nineteenth century,\nincorporating the first half-century of the industrial revolution.\nKarl Marx, for example, did not condemn the steam engine or the\nspinning mill for the vices of the bourgeois mode of production; he\nbelieved that ongoing technological innovation allowed for the\nnecessary steps toward the more blissful stages of socialism and\ncommunism of the future. A discussion of different views on the role\nof technology in Marx\u2019s theory of historical development can be\nfound in Bimber 1990. See Van der Pot 1985 [1994/2004] for an\nextensive historical overview of appreciations of the development of\ntechnology generally.\n\nA turning point in the appreciation of technology as a socio-cultural\nphenomenon is marked by Samuel Butler\u2019s Erewhon (1872),\nwritten under the influence of the Industrial Revolution, and\nDarwin\u2019s On the Origin of Species (1859).\nButler\u2019s book gave an account of a fictional country where all\nmachines are banned and the possession of a machine or the attempt to\nbuild one is a capital crime. The people of this country had become\nconvinced by an argument that ongoing technical improvements are\nlikely to lead to a \u2018race\u2019 of machines that will replace\nmankind as the dominant species on earth. This introduced a theme that\nhas remained influential in the perception of technology ever\nsince.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the nineteenth century and most of the\ntwentieth century a critical attitude predominated in philosophical\nreflection on technology. The representatives of this attitude were,\noverwhelmingly, schooled in the humanities or the social sciences and\nhad virtually no first-hand knowledge of engineering practice. Whereas\nBacon wrote extensively on the method of science and conducted\nphysical experiments himself, Butler, being a clergyman, lacked such\nfirst-hand knowledge. Ernst Kapp, who was the first to use the term\n\u2018philosophy of technology\u2019 in his book Eine\nPhilosophie der Technik (1877 [2018]), was a philologist and\nhistorian. Most of the authors who wrote critically about technology\nand its socio-cultural role during the twentieth century were\nphilosophers of a general outlook, such as Martin Heidegger (1954\n[1977]), Hans Jonas (1979 [1984]), Arnold Gehlen (1957 [1980]),\nG\u00fcnther Anders (1956), and Andrew Feenberg (1999). Others had a\nbackground in one of the other humanities or in social science, such\nas literary criticism and social research in the case of Lewis Mumford\n(1934), law in the case of Jacques Ellul (1954 [1964]), political\nscience in the case of Langdon Winner (1977, 1980, 1983) and literary\nstudies in the case of Albert Borgmann (1984). The form of philosophy\nof technology constituted by the writings of these and others has been\ncalled by Carl Mitcham (1994) \u201chumanities philosophy of\ntechnology\u201d, because it takes its point of departure from the\nhumanities and the social sciences rather than from the practices of\nscience and engineering, and it approaches technology accepting\n\u201cthe primacy of the humanities over technologies\u201d (1994:\n39), since technology originates from the goals and values of humans.\n\n\nHumanities philosophers of technology tend to take the phenomenon of\ntechnology itself largely for granted; they treat it as a \u2018black\nbox\u2019, a given, a unitary, monolithic, inescapable phenomenon.\nTheir interest is not so much to analyze and understand this\nphenomenon itself but to grasp its relations to morality (Jonas,\nGehlen), politics (Winner), the structure of society (Mumford), human\nculture (Ellul), the human condition (Hannah Arendt), or metaphysics\n(Heidegger). In this, these philosophers are almost all openly\ncritical of technology: all things considered, they tend to have a\nnegative judgment of the way technology has affected human society and\nculture, or at least they single out for consideration the negative\neffects of technology on human society and culture. This does not\nnecessarily mean that technology itself is pointed out as the\nprincipal cause of these negative developments. In the case of\nHeidegger, in particular, the paramount position of technology in\nmodern society is rather a symptom of something more fundamental,\nnamely a wrongheaded attitude towards Being which has been on the rise\nfor almost 25 centuries. It is therefore questionable whether\nHeidegger should be considered as a philosopher of technology,\nalthough within the humanities view he is considered to be among the\nmost important ones. Much the same could be said about Arendt, in\nparticular her discussion of technology in The Human\nCondition (1958), although her position in the canon of\nhumanities philosophy of technology is not as prominent as is\nHeidegger\u2019s.\n\nTo be sure, the work of these founding figures of humanities\nphilosophy of technology has been taken further by a second and third\ngeneration of scholars\u2014in particular the work of Heidegger\nremains an important source of inspiration\u2014but who in doing so\nhave adopted a more neutral rather than overall negative view of\ntechnology and its meaning for human life and culture. Notable\nexamples are Ihde (1979, 1993) and Verbeek (2000 [2005]).\n\nIn its development, humanities philosophy of technology continues to\nbe influenced not so much by developments in philosophy (e.g.,\nphilosophy of science, philosophy of action, philosophy of mind) but\nby developments in the social sciences and humanities. Although, for\nexample, Ihde and those who take their point of departure with him,\nposition their work as phenomenologist or postphenomenologist, there\ndoes not seem to be much interest in either the past or the present of\nthis diffuse notion in philosophy, and in particular not much interest\nin the far from easy question to what extent Heidegger can be\nconsidered a phenomenologist. Of particular significance has been the\nemergence of \u2018Science and Technology Studies\u2019 (STS) in the\n1980s, which studies from a broad social-scientific perspective how\nsocial, political, and cultural values affect scientific research and\ntechnological innovation, and how these in turn affect society,\npolitics, and culture. We discuss authors from humanities philosophy\nof technology in\n Section 3\n on \u2018Ethical and Social Aspects of Technology\u2019, but do not\npresent separately and in detail the wide variety of views existing in\nthis field. For a detailed treatment Mitcham\u2019s 1994 book still\nprovides an excellent overview. A recent coverage of humanities\nphilosophy of technology is available in Coeckelbergh\u2019s (2020a)\ntextbook. Olsen, Selinger and Riis (2008) and Vallor (2022) offer\nwide-ranging collections of contributions; Scharff and Dusek (2003\n[2014]) and Kaplan (2004 [2009]) present comprehensive anthologies of\ntexts from this tradition.\n",
