    "main_text": "\n\n\nTheory of knowledge,\npram\u0101\u1e47a-\u015b\u0101stra, is a rich genre of\nSanskrit literature, spanning almost twenty centuries, carried out in\ntexts belonging to distinct schools of philosophy. Debate across\nschool occurs especially on epistemological issues, but no author\nwrites on knowledge independently of the sort of metaphysical\ncommitment that defines the various classical systems\n(dar\u015bana), realist and idealist, dualist and monist,\ntheist and atheist, and so on. And every one of the dozen or so major\nschools from early in its history takes a position on knowledge and\njustification, if only, as with the Buddhist skeptic\n(Prasa\u1e45gika), to attack the theories of others.  There\nare nevertheless many common epistemological assumptions or attitudes,\nthe most striking of which is a focus on a belief\u2019s source in\nquestions of justification. Mainstream classical Indian epistemology\nis dominated by theories about pedigree, i.e., views about\nknowledge-generating processes, called\npram\u0101\u1e47a, \u201cknowledge sources.\u201d The\nprincipal candidates are perception, inference, and testimony. Other\nprocesses seem not truth-conducive or reducible to one or more of the\nwidely accepted sources such as perception and inference. However,\nsurprising candidates such as non-perception (for knowledge of\nabsences) and presumption (defended as distinct from\ninference) provoke complex arguments especially in the later\ntexts\u2014from about 1000 when the number of Sanskrit philosophical works\nof some of the schools begins to proliferate almost exponentially. The\nlater texts present more intricate views and arguments than the earlier\nfrom which the later authors learned. Classical Indian philosophy is an\nunbroken tradition of reflection expressed in the pan-Subcontinent\nintellectual language of Sanskrit. Or, we should say it is comprised of\ninterlocking traditions since there are the distinct schools,\nall nevertheless using Sanskrit and engaging with other schools.\nLater authors expand and carry forward positions and arguments of their\npredecessors.\n\n\nSkepticism and the issue of whether knowledge that p\nentails that you know that you know that p are addressed as\nwell as the question of the usefulness of knowledge not only for the\npurposes of everyday life but also the religious goal of\nworld-transcendence, about which most schools take positions.\nThe authority of testimony, among candidate sources, is considered\nby some to have special religious importance. Others view yogic\nperception and/or meditative experience as crucial for religious\nknowledge, which is usually distinguished from the everyday knowledge analyzed\nin the textbooks of epistemology.\n",
