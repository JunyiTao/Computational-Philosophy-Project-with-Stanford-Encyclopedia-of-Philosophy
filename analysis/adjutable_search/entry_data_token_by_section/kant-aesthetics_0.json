    "main_text": "The Faculty of Judgment and the Unity of the Third Critique\n1. The Faculty of Judgment and the Unity of the Third Critique\n\nKant\u2019s account of aesthetics and teleology is ostensibly part of\na broader discussion of the faculty or power of judgment\n[Urteilskraft], which is the faculty \u201cfor thinking the\nparticular under the universal\u201d (Introduction IV, 5:179).\nAlthough the Critique of Pure Reason includes some discussion\nof the faculty of judgment, defined as \u201cthe capacity to subsume\nunder rules, that is, to distinguish whether something falls under a\ngiven rule\u201d (A132/B171), it is not until the Critique of\nJudgment that he treats judgment as a full-fledged faculty in its\nown right, with its own a priori principle, and, accordingly,\nrequiring a \u201ccritique\u201d to determine its scope and\nlimits.\n\nKant describes judgment in the Critique of Judgment as having\ntwo roles or aspects, \u201cdetermining\u201d [bestimmend]\nand \u201creflecting\u201d [reflektierend] (Introduction\nIV, 5:179 and FI V, 20:211). Judgment in its determining role subsumes\ngiven particulars under concepts or universals which are themselves\nalready given. This role coincides with the role assigned to the\nfaculty of judgment in the Critique of Pure Reason; it also\nappears to correspond to the activity of imagination in its\n\u201cschematism\u201d of concepts. Judgment in this role does not\noperate as an independent faculty, but is instead governed by\nprinciples of the understanding. The more distinctive role assigned to\njudgment in the Critique of Judgment is the reflecting role,\nthat of \u201cfinding\u201d the universal for the given particular\n(Introduction IV, 5:179). Kant\u2019s recognition of judgment as a\nfaculty in its own right, and hence of the need for a\nCritique not just for theoretical and practical reason but\nalso for judgment, appears to be connected with his ascription to\njudgment of a reflecting, in addition to a merely determining,\nrole.\n\nJudgment as reflecting, or reflective judgment [reflektierende\nUrteilskraft], is assigned various different roles within\nKant\u2019s system. Kant describes it as responsible for various\ncognitive tasks associated with empirical scientific enquiry, in\nparticular, the classification of natural things into a hierarchical\ntaxonomy of genera and species, and the construction of systematic\nexplanatory scientific theories. Kant also suggests that it has a more\nfundamental role to play in making cognition possible, in particular\nthat it enables us to regard nature as empirically lawlike (see\nespecially Introduction V, 5:184), and, even more fundamentally, that\nit is responsible for the formation of all empirical concepts (see\nespecially FI V, 20:211\u2013213).\n\nBut reflective judgment is also described as responsible for two\nspecific kinds of judgments: aesthetic judgments (judgments about the\nbeautiful and the sublime) and teleological judgments (judgments which\nascribe ends or purposes to natural things, or which characterize them\nin purposive or functional terms). These, along with associated\ntopics, are discussed respectively in Section I, the \u201cCritique\nof Aesthetic Judgment, \u201d and Section II, the \u201cCritique of\nTeleological Judgment. \u201d The discussion of the role of judgment\nin empirical scientific enquiry is confined to a few sections of the\nIntroduction and First Introduction.\n\nAlthough reflective judgment is exercised in both aesthetic and\nteleological judgment, Kant assigns a special role to its exercise in\nthe aesthetic case, and specifically in judgments of beauty\n(Introduction VIII, 193; FI XI, 243\u2013244). More specifically, he\nsays, it is in judgments of beauty (as opposed to the sublime), and\neven more specifically, judgments about the beauty of nature (as\nopposed to art), that \u201cjudgment reveals itself as a faculty that\nhas its own special principle\u201d (FI XI, 244). The especially\nclose connection between judgments of beauty and the faculty of\njudgment is reflected in Kant\u2019s view that the feeling of\npleasure in a beautiful object is felt in virtue of an exercise of\nreflective judgment (Introduction VII, FI VIII).\n\nMuch of Kant\u2019s aesthetics and theory of teleology is developed\nwithout any explicit reference to the faculty of judgment, and the\n\u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d makes no mention of\nreflective judgment as it figures in empirical scientific enquiry (in\nfact, the term \u201creflective judgment\u201d does not\nappear in the \u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d at\nall). The only suggestion in the \u201cCritique of Aesthetic\nJudgment\u201d of an important role for the faculty of judgment in\nKant\u2019s aesthetics is in the Deduction of Taste, where he\ndescribes the principle of taste as the \u201csubjective principle of\njudgment in general\u201d (\u00a735, 286) and suggests that the\nrelation of aesthetic judgment specifically to the faculty of judgment\nin general is crucial for the legitimacy of judgments of beauty\n(\u00a738, 290). Accordingly, much of the secondary literature on\nKant\u2019s aesthetics has treated it in isolation from the more\ngeneral account of judgment in which it is embedded, and the same is\ntrue, perhaps to an even greater extent, in the case of Kant\u2019s\nteleology. Conversely, discussions of Kant\u2019s \u201ctheory of\njudgment\u201d have typically taken little or no account of\nKant\u2019s treatment of judgment in the third Critique,\nsuggesting thereby that Kant\u2019s views on judgment are exhausted\nby his account of cognitive (in particular non-aesthetic) judgments in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason and the Logic. (The\narticle\n \u201cKant\u2019s Theory of Judgment\u201d\n in the present Encyclopedia [Hanna 2004 [2018]] is one example.)\n\nHowever, since the late 1980s philosophers working on Kant have become\nincreasingly interested in the notion of judgment in the third\nCritique. One way in which this interest has been pursued is\nthrough an exploration of the relation of Kant\u2019s notion of\njudgment in the third Critique to his account of cognition in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason and the Logic.\nLonguenesse (1993 [1998]) maintains that there is a close connection\nbetween the \u201ccapacity to judge\u201d [Verm\u00f6gen zu\nurteilen] in that work and the faculty of judgment in the\nCritique of Judgment, a connection which she summarizes by\ndescribing the faculty of judgment as the \u201cactualization\u201d\nof the capacity to judge in relation to sensory perceptions (1993\n[1998: 8]). According to Longuenesse, the activity of reflective\njudgment corresponds to the \u201ccomparison, reflection and\nabstraction\u201d which Kant describes in the Logic\n(\u00a76, 9:94\u201395) as responsible for the formation of empirical\nconcepts, and which she understands as, in turn, a necessary condition\nof the application of the pure concepts of understanding to the\nmanifold of sensible intuition (1993 [1998: 163\u2013166 and\n195\u2013197]). Longuenesse\u2019s view on this point is endorsed\nand elaborated in Allison 2001: ch. 1.\n\nAnother manifestation of interest in the notion of judgment has been\nthe exploration of connections between Kant\u2019s account of\naesthetic experience and judgment in the third Critique and\nhis theory of cognitive judgments in the first Critique. Bell\n(1987) and Ginsborg (1990a) both argue that, for Kant, the possibility\nof aesthetic experience to be, in some sense, a condition of the\npossibility of cognitive judgment; Makkreel (1990), from a more\nContinental, and specifically hermeneutical perspective, also argues\nfor deep connections between Kant\u2019s aesthetics and his account\nof cognition. Kukla (2006) collects together a number of essays\nexploring the relation between Kant\u2019s aesthetics and his theory\nof cognition; the introduction to Kukla 2006 offers some historical\nperspective on the increased interest in Kant\u2019s aesthetics as\nplaying a systematic role in Kant\u2019s epistemological program.\nHughes (2007: ch. 5) argues that Kant\u2019s views in the\nCritique of Judgment are necessary for a full understanding\nof Kant\u2019s account of synthesis in the first Critique and for the\nTranscendental Deduction of the categories in the first\nCritique. Ginsborg (2006) and Geiger (2020) both argue for a\nconnection between the possibility of aesthetic judgment and that of\nthe acquisition of empirical concepts. Breitenbach (2021) proposes\nthat aesthetic judgment and cognitive judgment share a \u201ccommon\ncore\u201d of imaginative reflection which helps account for\nscientific creativity. Makkai (2021: ch. 1), while sympathetic to the\nidea that Kant\u2019s aesthetics makes a contribution to his view of\ncognition, argues that several attempts to make out the connection,\nincluding those of Bell (1987) and Allison (2001), rest on a mistaken\nconstrual of Kant\u2019s notion of judgment. Rather than endorsing\nthe idea that aesthetic judgment is somehow presupposed by cognition,\nshe proposes that they are parallel, both having a basis in reflective\njudgment (Makkai 2021: ch. 4).\n\nAn important reason why commentators have been interested in\nKant\u2019s account of judgment in the Critique of Judgment\nis as a potential solution to the question of what unifies the various\nparts of the Critique of Judgment, and, in particular, what\nconnects the discussion of aesthetics in the first half of the book\nwith that of teleology in the second half of the book. Until the\n1980s, many commentators were skeptical that there was any real\nphilosophical connection between the \u201cCritique of Aesthetic\nJudgment\u201d (Part I) and the \u201cCritique of Teleological\nJudgment\u201d (Part II); for expressions of this view see for\nexample Schopenhauer (1819/1859 [1969: vol. I, 531]), Marc-Wogau\n(1938: 34n.), and Beck (1969: 497). But since then there has been much\nmore interest in understanding the work as a unified whole, where this\ninvolves recognizing connections, not only between the \u201cCritique\nof Aesthetic Judgment\u201d and the \u201cCritique of Teleological\nJudgment\u201d, but also between those two sections and the\nIntroduction (and First Introduction) to the Critique of\nJudgment as a whole. (The decision by the editors of the present\nEncyclopedia to treat the seemingly disparate topics of Kant\u2019s\naesthetics and Kant\u2019s teleology in a single article represents\none illustration of this general orientation towards the unity of the\nwork.)\n\nOne way in which commentators have tried to find unity in the\nCritique of Judgment is by connecting Kant\u2019s aesthetics\nwith his discussions, in the Introduction and First Introduction, of\nthe search for a system of empirical concepts and laws. Examples of\nthis approach include Ginsborg (1990a), Hughes (2007), Zuckert\n(2007a), and Geiger (2020). Another, potentially complementary, way is\nto find connections between his theory of beauty and his views on\nbiology in the Critique of Teleological Judgment. Zumbach (1984:\n51\u201353) suggests that works of art are analogous to organisms;\nMakkreel (1990: ch. 5) sees the connection as turning on the idea of\npleasure as the feeling of mental life. Aquila (1992) draws a\nconnection between the internal structure of organisms as one in which\nthe whole determines the parts, and the internal structure of a\njudgment of beauty as one in which a feeling of pleasure rather than a\nconcept serves as a predicate. Ginsborg (1997a) connects Kant\u2019s\naesthetics and his biological views in terms of the idea of\npurposiveness construed as normativity: the normativity in the\nfunctioning of organisms parallels the normative claim to universal\nagreement made by a judgment of beauty. Zuckert (2007a) offers an\nespecially detailed account of the connection, also emphasizing the\nnotion of purposiveness, but construing it as unity in diversity,\nwhich is manifested in beautiful objects and organisms alike. Geiger\n(2020) suggests that organisms play a special role as objects of\naesthetic judgment, and suggests that our aesthetic judgments about\norganisms are closely allied to our sorting of nature into kinds and\nhence our acquisition of empirical concepts.\n\nA contrasting approach to the unity of the Critique of\nJudgment goes by way of Kant\u2019s moral teleology, and invokes\nKant\u2019s claim that the Critique of Judgment is intended\nto bridge the gulf between nature and freedom (Introduction II and\nIII, 175\u2013177). This approach is implicit in many discussions of\nthe relevance of Kant\u2019s aesthetics to his account of morality\n(see\n Section 2.8),\n which in turn can be connected to his theory of teleology through the\nidea that the human being, as a free and rational agent, is the\n\u201cultimate purpose\u201d [Endzweck] of nature (see\n Section 3.6).\n Gardner (2016) offers an explicit defence of this kind of approach,\ndrawing on the idea that aesthetic experience reveals the suitability\nof nature for human moral agency; this idea is also emphasized in\nWicks (2007). Savile (2021) invokes a related idea and ascribes it to\nKant under the label of \u201caesthetic humanism\u201d. Vaccarino\nBremner (forthcoming) develops this kind of approach in detail by\nfocussing on Kant\u2019s idea of culture, which Kant identifies as\nthe ultimate purpose [letzter Zweck] of nature (5:429), and\nwhich, on her view, mediates between nature itself and the final\npurpose [Endzweck] of nature, that is the human being as a\nmoral agent.\n\nThe theme of the unity of the Critique of Judgment is closely\nrelated to that of the role of the Critique of Judgment in\nKant\u2019s overall philosophical system. Pollok (2017: ch. 9) offers\nsome brief but suggestive remarks on that topic; Huseyinzadegan (2018)\naddresses both the internal unity of the Critique of Judgment\nand its relation to Kant\u2019s Opus Postumum.\n",
