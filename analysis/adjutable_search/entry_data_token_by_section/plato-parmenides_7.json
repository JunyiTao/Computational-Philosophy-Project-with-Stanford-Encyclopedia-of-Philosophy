In what appears to be a severely truncated\nargument, Parmenides provides two sets of reasons for thinking that\nthis suggestion will not avoid absurdity either. (Allen (1997,\n174) argues that Parmenides only provides a single argument here, one\nthat most would identify as the second of two.)\n\n\nParmenides\u2019 first argument appears to have the following\nstructure. First, all thoughts have intentional objects: every thought\nis of something rather than nothing. Second, the object of\nany thought T is something that T thinks to be one\nover all the instances. But anything that is thought to be one over\nall the instances is a form. Parmenides concludes that the intentional\nobject of every thought is a form, and hence if every form is a\nthought then every form is a thought of a form. Although Parmenides\ndoes not make this explicit, it is plain that if every form is\nnumerically distinct from the form of which it is the intentional\nobject, then (thanks to Self-Predication and Non-Identity) an infinite\nregress of forms beckons (see Rickless (2007, 75\u201379), and also\nGill (1996, 40) and Sayre (1996, 84)). Again, there is nothing to\nsuggest that Plato finds the existence of an infinite regress\nproblematic in itself. Rather, the existence of a regress threatens\nUniqueness, and, when combined in the appropriate way with Purity-F,\nthreatens Oneness. The reasoning that leads to conflict with Oneness\nis parallel to the relevantly similar portion of the Third Man\nargument (see section 4.3 above, and Rickless (2007, 79\u201380) for\ndetails).\n\n\nAs if this weren\u2019t bad enough, Parmenides goes on to derive a\nfurther absurdity from the result of combining the proposal that forms\nare thoughts with the Pie Model conception of partaking. Assuming\nthat thoughts do not have parts, the only way for an object to partake\nof a thought in accordance with the Pie Model is for the object to get\nthe thought as a whole. So if forms are thoughts, then according\nto the Pie Model everything is composed of thoughts, and hence all\nthings think. But, Parmenides assumes, this panpsychist thesis is\nabsurd. Parmenides considers a way of avoiding this absurdity\nthat depends on assuming that something\u2019s having a thought as a\npart does not entail that it is a thinking thing. But, argues\nParmenides, the only way to make sense of this proposal is to assume\nthat thoughts are unthinking, an assumption that is also absurd in\nitself.\n",
