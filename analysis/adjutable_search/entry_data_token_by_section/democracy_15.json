Social Choice and Democracy\n\nKenneth Arrow\u2019s impossibility theorem is thought by some to\nprovide a major set of difficulties for democratic theory (Arrow\n1951). William Riker, Russell Hardin, and others have thought that the\nimpossibility theorem shows that there are deep problems with\ndemocratic ideals (Riker 1982; Hardin 1999). Neither of these thinkers\nare opposed to democracy itself, they both think that there are good\ninstrumental reasons for having democracy. \n\nThe basic results of social choice theory are laid out in detail\nelsewhere in the encyclopedia (List 2013). Here we will simply\narticulate the basic result and an illustration. The question of\nArrowian social choice theory is: how do we determine a social\npreference for a society overall on the basis of the set of the\nindividual preferences of the members? Arrow shows that a social\nchoice function that satisfies a number of plausible constraints\ncannot be defined when there are three or more alternatives to be\nchosen by the group. He lays out a number of conditions to be imposed\non a social choice function. Unlimited domain: The social\nchoice function must be able to give us a social preference no matter\nwhat the preferences of the individuals over alternatives are. Non\ndictatorship: the social choice function must not select the\npreference of one particular member regardless of others\u2019\npreferences. Transitivity and completeness: The individual\npreferences orderings must be transitive and complete orderings and\nthe social preference derived from them must be transitive and\ncomplete. Independence of irrelevant alternatives: the social\npreference between two alternatives must be the result only of the\nindividual orderings between those two alternatives. Pareto\ncondition: if all the members prefer an alternative x over\ny, then x must be ranked above y in the social\npreference. The theorem says that no social choice function over more\nthan two alternatives can satisfy all of these conditions.\n\nA useful illustration of this idea involves an extension of majority\nrule to cases of more than two alternatives. The Condorcet rule says\nthat an alternative x wins when, for every other alternative, a\nmajority prefers x over that alternative. For example, suppose\nwe have three persons A, B and C and three\nalternatives x, y and z. A prefers\nx over y, y over z; B prefers\ny over z and z over x; C prefers\nx over z and z over y. In this case,\nx is the Condorcet winner since it beats y, and it beats\nz. The problem with this plausible sounding rule is the case of\na majority cycle. Suppose you have three persons A, B\nand C, and three alternatives, x, y and z.\nIn the case in which A prefers x over y and y\nover z, while B prefers y over z and\nz over x, and C prefers z over x\nand x over y, the Condorcet rule will yield a social\npreference of x over y, y over z and\nz over x. One can see here that the Condorcet rule\nsatisfies all the conditions except transitivity of social preference.\nOne way to avoid intransitivity is to restrict the domain of\npreferences from which the social preference arises. Another is to\nintroduce cardinal information that compares the how much people\nprefer alternatives (violating independence). Another might be to make\none person a dictator. So, this case nicely illustrates that one\ncannot satisfy all of the constraints simultaneously.\n\nRiker argues that the theorem shows that the idea that the popular\nwill can be the governing element in a society is false. If an\nexistence condition for a popular will is a restricted set of\npreferences the question naturally arises as to whether such a\ncondition is always or normally met in a moderately complex society.\nWe might wonder whether a highly pluralistic society with a very\ncomplex division of labor is likely to satisfy the restricted\npreference set condition necessary to avoid cycles or other\npathologies of social choice. Some have argued that we have empirical\nevidence to the effect that modern societies do normally satisfy such\nconditions (Mackie 2003). Others have argued that this seems unlikely\n(Riker 1982; Ingham 2019). This is not merely a defense of unlimited\ndomain. It is a defense of the thesis that normally the collections of\npreferences in modern societies are not likely to have the properties\nthat enable them to avoid cycles.\n\nThe fairness critique from social choice theory is based on the idea\nthat when a voting process meets requirements of fairness, the\nfairness of the process and the preferences may not generate\ndeterminate outcomes. If cycles are pervasive, the outcomes of\ndemocratic processes may be determined by clever strategies and not by\nthe fairness of the procedures (Riker 1982). Three remarks are in\norder here. First, it is compatible with the process being completely\nfair that the outcomes of the process are indeterminate. After all,\ncoin flips are fair. Second, there is some question as to how\nprominent the cycles are. Third, one might think that if the\nconditions which enable opposing sides to strategize effectively are\nthemselves roughly equal, then the concerns for fairness are fully\nmet. If resources for persuasion and organization are distributed in\nan egalitarian way, perhaps the fairness account is vindicated after\nall. This point can be made more compelling when we consider Sean\nIngham\u2019s account of political equality. He includes intensity of\npreference in his account of fairness. This is a departure from the\nArrowian approach, but it is in many ways a realistic one. The idea is\nthat majorities have equal control over policy areas when they are\nable to get what they want with the same amount of intensity of\npreferences. And equality holds generally when all groups of the same\nsize have the same control (Ingham 2019). There remains an extreme\ncase in which all majorities have equal intensity of preference and\nare caught in a majority cycle. But the chances of this happening are\nvery slim, even if the chances of majority cycles more generally are\nnot as small. Even if there are a lot of majority cycles, if the\nissues are resolved in such a way that those majorities that have most\nat stake in the conflict are the ones that get their way, then we can\nhave fairness in a quite robust sense even while having pervasive\nmajority cycles. \n",
