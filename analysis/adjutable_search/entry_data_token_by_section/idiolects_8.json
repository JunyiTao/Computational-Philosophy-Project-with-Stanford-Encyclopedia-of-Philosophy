    "main_text": "E-Languages versus I-Languages || Second Response to the I-language Perspective: Psycholinguistics\n3.3 Second Response to the I-language Perspective: Psycholinguistics\n\nMore recently, a whole field of scientific research,\npsycholinguistics, has been precisely dedicated to studying external,\nanti-individualistic, mind-independent properties of language,\nmassively advancing our understanding of language development in the\nprocess (see Hoff and Shatz 2007). The guiding assumption within this\nfield is that external factors, such as the child\u2019s social and\nphysical environment, can play a substantial role in determining both\nthe child\u2019s linguistic competence and the vocabulary and syntax\nof the acquired language. On this view, such external factors supply\nmost, if not all, of the relevant stimuli for language acquisition,\ncontrary to Chomsky\u2019s central poverty of stimulus argument for\nI-languages.\n\nSeveral different inquires have benefited from psycholinguistic\nstudies of overt linguistic behavior. These include questions about\nthe relative autonomy of distinct areas of linguistic knowledge, such\nas the question: are syntax, semantics and pragmatics independent from\neach other, or do they rather support each other? (see Gleitman,\nCassidy, et al. 2005; Gleitman 1990; Naigles and Swensen 2007; and\nDiesendruck 2007); and about the role of the child in the process of\nlanguage acquisition: is the child a passive subject, or an active\nparticipant within her linguistic community (see Shatz 1987, 1994;\nShafer and Garrido-Nag 2007; and Poulin-Dubois and Graham 2007)?\n\nWe saw (in section\n 3.1.1\n and\n 3.1.2)\n that Chomsky\u2019s case for I-languages and against E-languages is\nheavily entwined with the poverty of stimulus assumption. This is used\nto defend the claim that human languages are little more than\nmodifications of UG, and that the process of language acquisition and\ndevelopment is the process of such modifications. But studies have\nshown that social input, which children may pick up from and rely on,\nis rich both in content and structure (see Baldwin and Meyer 2007). In\nchild-directed speech, adults use words in a way that makes it easier\nfor children to identify the relevant information (see Brent and\nSiskind 2001; Akhtar, Dunham, and Dunham 1991), suggesting that social\ninput is highly relevant to the development of semantic knowledge.\nEven if we limit the UG hypothesis to a claim about syntax there are\nempirical challenges. According to this more limited reading, the\nacquisition of syntactic process is \u201cseen to rely most heavily\non the operation of innate structural principles\u201d (Baldwin and\nMeyer 2007: 95). Social input, on this view, plays a mere triggering\nrole. Further studies have shown this hypothesis to be controversial.\nAlternative, socio-pragmatic, accounts have shown that children can\nlearn syntax from adult language use (see Tomasello 2003, 2004).\nChildren\u2019s domain general abilities of statistical analysis, and\npattern and intention recognition, are believed to assist the child in\nidentifying and acquiring syntactic structure from the social\nlinguistic input they receive (see Saffran, Aslin, and Newport 1996;\nGentner, Holyoak, and Kokinov 2001). In general, the empirical\nevidence obtained by psycholinguistic studies strongly suggests that\nlanguage acquisition and development is much more than just a process\nof UG modifications by means of mind/brain maturation.\n\nHowever these debates evolve, two things seem clear. First, the\nexternal, anti-individualistic, mind-independent properties of\nlanguage, including overt linguistic behavior, are apt for proper\nscientific investigation. Exactly how much of a threat this is to\nChomsky\u2019s view is a matter for debate, since as we saw (in\n 3.1.2)\n he insists he is not denying that language is at least partly a\nsocial product; but the claims made on the back of these results\ncertainly seem to run contrary to the thrust of his internalism. And,\nsecond, against Chomsky\u2019s skepticism, there are good reasons to\ndevelop such research into external influences, as it may prove to be\ncentral for a proper understanding of the semantics, and even the\ngrammar and syntax, of human language and its acquisition.\n",
