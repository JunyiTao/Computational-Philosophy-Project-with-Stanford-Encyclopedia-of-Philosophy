    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nBecause Dante\u2019s poetic persona looms so large in his writings,\nvery little can be said about his biography that does not, in some\nway, depend upon an interpretations of his continual re-crafting of\nthat persona. It is generally accepted that Dante was born in 1265 in\nFlorence. If it is true that he was born under the sign of\nGemini\u2014as reported in Paradiso\n22.112\u2013120\u2014then his birthday would have been sometime in\nMay or June of that year. According to the testimony of his own\nwritings, at the age of nine he met for the first time the\neight-year-old Beatrice Portinari, whom, subsequent to her death in\n1290, Dante consistently invoked as the key inspiration for his poetic\nvision and personal salvation.\n\nAlso according to the testimony of his own writing, Dante believed\nhimself to be\u2014or at least wished for his readers to believe him\nto be\u2014a descendant of the ancient Roman families who founded\nFlorence. In Paradiso 15, for instance, he claims that his\ngreat-great-grandfather Cacciaguida had been knighted by emperor\nConrad and died fighting as a crusader in the Holy Land\u2014a claim\nthat a recent biographer has noted \u201cmight be traced back to\nDante\u2019s desire, particularly apparent at the time of the\nCommedia, to give dignity to a family which, in reality,\ncould boast no noble roots nor any knights among it, least of all of\nimperial investiture\u201d [Santagata (2016), 20].\n\nWhile it remains difficult to separate myth from fact in\nreconstructing Dante\u2019s biography, it is nevertheless undoubtedly\ntrue that Dante\u2019s philosophical perspective and poetic ambitions\nwere powerfully shaped by the context of his upbringing in late\nthirteenth-century Florence. Between 1285, when he married and began a\nfamily, and 1302, when he was exiled from Florence, he was active in\nthe cultural and civic life of Florence, served as a soldier, and held\nseveral political offices. Within this context, despite his own\norigins in a family possessing only modest wealth, Dante\u2019s\nparticipation in Florentine politics played a crucial role in the\ndevelopment of his philosophical thinking as well as in advancing his\npoetic ambitions.\n\nSince the early thirteenth century, two great factions, the Guelfs and\nthe Ghibellines, had competed for control of Florence. The Guelfs,\nwith whom Dante was allied, were identified with Florentine political\nautonomy, and with the interests of the Papacy in its long struggle\nagainst the centralizing ambitions of the Hohenstaufen emperors, who\nwere supported by the Ghibellines. After Charles of Anjou, with the\nblessing of the Papacy and strong Guelf support, defeated Hohenstaufen\narmies at Benevento (1265/6) and Tagliacozzo (1268), the Guelfs became\nthe dominant force in Florence. By the end of the century, the Guelfs\nwere themselves riven by faction, grounded largely in family and\neconomic interests, but also exhibiting differing degrees of loyalty\nto the papacy.\n\nIn 1301, when conflict erupted between the \u201cBlacks,\u201d the\nfaction most strongly committed to aristocratic and papal interests,\nand the wealthier but less illustrious \u201cWhites,\u201d Pope\nBoniface VIII instigated a partisan settlement which allowed the\nBlacks to exile the White leadership, of whom Dante was was a member.\nHe never returned to Florence, and played no further role in public\nlife, though he remained passionately interested in Italian politics,\nand became virtually the prophet of world empire in the years leading\nup to the coronation of Henry VII of Luxembourg as head of the Holy\nRoman Empire (1312). The development of Dante\u2019s almost messianic\nsense of the imperial role is hard to trace, but it was doubtless\naffected by his bitterness over what he saw as the autocratic and\ntreacherous conduct of Pope Boniface, and a growing conviction that\nonly a strong, central authority could bring peace and stability order\nto Italy.\n\nDuring the next twenty years Dante lived in several Italian cities,\nspending at least two long periods at the court of Can Grande della\nScala, lord of Verona. In 1319 he moved from Verona to Ravenna, where\nhe completed the Paradiso, and where he died in 1321.\n\nAs a poet, Dante\u2019s major theme, from first to last, is the\nsignificance of his love for Beatrice, but he also clearly understood\nhimself to be a public intellectual strongly committed to raising the\nlevel of vernacular discourse. After his banishment he addressed\nhimself to Italians generally, and devoted much of his long exile to\ntransmitting the riches of ancient thought and learning, as these\ninformed contemporary scholastic culture, to an increasingly\nsophisticated lay readership in their own vernacular.\n\nThis project was Dante\u2019s contribution to a long-standing Italian\ncultural tradition. His reading in philosophy began, he tells us, with\nCicero and Boethius, whose writings are in large part the record of\ntheir dedication to the task of establishing a Latinate intellectual\nculture in Italy. The Convivio and the De vulgari\neloquentia preserve also the somewhat idealized memory of the\nNeapolitan court of Frederick II of Sicily (1195\u20131250) and his\nson Manfred (1232\u201366), intellectuals in their own right as well\nas patrons of poets and philosophers, whom Dante viewed as having\nrevived the ancient tradition of the statesman-philosopher [Van Cleve,\n299\u2013332]. Dante himself probably studied under Brunetto Latini\n(1220\u201394), whose encyclopedic Livres dou Tresor\n(1262\u201366), written while Brunetto was a political exile in\nFrance, provided vernacular readers with a compendium of the Liberal\nArts and a digest of Aristotelian ethical and political thought\n[Meier; Imbach (1993), 37\u201347; Davis (1984), 166\u201397].\n\nBut the fullest embodiment of Dante\u2019s contribution to the\ntradition of Italian vernacular writing is, above all, his Divine\nComedy\u2014a work in which we see for the first time a powerful\nthinker, solidly grounded in Aristotle, patristic theology, and\nthirteenth-century scholastic debate, synthesizing and bringing these\nresources to bear on educating his countrymen in their own vernacular\nwith the intention of inspiring them to pursue the happiness that\nrewards the philosopher.\n",
