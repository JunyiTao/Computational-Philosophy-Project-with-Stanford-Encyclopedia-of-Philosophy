    "main_text": "Concepts of Consciousness || Creature Consciousness\n2.1 Creature Consciousness\n\n\nAn animal, person or other cognitive system may be regarded as\nconscious in a number of different senses.\n\nSentience. It may be conscious in the generic sense of\nsimply being a sentient creature, one capable of sensing and\nresponding to its world (Armstrong 1981). Being conscious in this sense\nmay admit of degrees, and just what sort of sensory capacities are\nsufficient may not be sharply defined. Are fish conscious in the\nrelevant respect? And what of shrimp or bees?\n\nWakefulness. One might further require that the organism\nactually be exercising such a capacity rather than merely having the\nability or disposition to do so. Thus one might count it as conscious\nonly if it were awake and normally alert. In that sense\norganisms would not count as conscious when asleep or in any of the\ndeeper levels of coma. Again boundaries may be blurry, and intermediate\ncases may be involved. For example, is one conscious in the relevant\nsense when dreaming, hypnotized or in a fugue state?\n\nSelf-consciousness. A third and yet more demanding sense\nmight define conscious creatures as those that are not only aware but\nalso aware that they are aware, thus treating creature consciousness as\na form of self-consciousness (Carruthers 2000). The\nself-awareness requirement might get interpreted in a variety of ways,\nand which creatures would qualify as conscious in the relevant sense\nwill vary accordingly. If it is taken to involve explicit conceptual\nself-awareness, many non-human animals and even young children might\nfail to qualify, but if only more rudimentary implicit forms of\nself-awareness are required then a wide range of nonlinguistic\ncreatures might count as self-conscious.\n\nWhat it is like. Thomas Nagel's (1974)\nfamous\u201cwhat it is like\u201d criterion aims to capture\nanother and perhaps more subjective notion of being a conscious\norganism. According to Nagel, a being is conscious just if there is\n\u201csomething that it is like\u201d to be that creature, i.e., some\nsubjective way the world seems or appears from the creature's mental or\nexperiential point of view. In Nagel's example, bats are conscious\nbecause there is something that it is like for a bat to experience its\nworld through its echo-locatory senses, even though we humans from our\nhuman point of view can not emphatically understand what such a mode of\nconsciousness is like from the bat's own point of view.\n\nSubject of conscious states. A fifth alternative would be\nto define the notion of a conscious organism in terms of conscious\nstates. That is, one might first define what makes a mental state a\nconscious mental state, and then define being a conscious creature in\nterms of having such states. One's concept of a conscious organism\nwould then depend upon the particular account one gives of conscious\nstates (section 2.2).\n\nTransitive Consciousness. In addition to describing\ncreatures as conscious in these various senses, there are also related\nsenses in which creatures are described as being conscious of\nvarious things. The distinction is sometimes marked as that between\ntransitive and intransitive notions of consciousness,\nwith the former involving some object at which consciousness is\ndirected (Rosenthal 1986).\n",
