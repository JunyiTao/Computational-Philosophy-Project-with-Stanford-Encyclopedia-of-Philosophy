    "main_text": "Biography and Works || Doctrinal Positions and Works\n1.2 Doctrinal Positions and Works\n\nVasubandhu composed works from the perspectives of several different\nphilosophical schools. In addition, his works often state doctrinal\npositions and arguments with which he disagrees, in order to refute\nthem. For this reason, scholars have used his works, especially his\nCommentary on the Treasury of the Abhidharma to explicate a\nrange of Buddhist and non-Buddhist positions prevalent during his\ntime.\n\nThe main Buddhist schools represented in his works are the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas or Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins of Kashmir and\nGandh\u0101ra, the V\u0101ts\u012bputr\u012byas, the Sautr\u0101ntikas\n(also called D\u0101r\u1e63t\u0101ntikas), and the\nYog\u0101c\u0101rins. He also argues with non-Buddhist, Orthodox\n(Hindu) positions, including especially S\u0101\u1e43khya and\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika views. It would appear that the only\nBuddhist school with which he always expresses disagreement is the\nV\u0101ts\u012bputr\u012byas, also called the Pudgalav\u0101dins or\n\u201cPersonalists.\u201d Vasubandhu\u2019s works are most often\nsaid to have been written either from the Sautr\u0101ntika perspective\nor from the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra perspective, depending upon the work.\nYet the verses of his Treasury of the Abhidharma summarize\nthe doctrines of the Kashmiri Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika school. It is only\nin the commentary that the Sautr\u0101ntika system tends to win the\nday, through numerous\n arguments.[10]\n And, it is quite often the case, even in the Commentary,\nthat Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika views are left unchallenged or\nunharmed.\n\nA great number of texts of the Therav\u0101da Abhidharma tradition are\nextant in P\u0101li, and a great number of Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\nAbhidharma texts exist in their Chinese translations. In Sanskrit and\nTibetan, however, nearly all of the \u201c\u015ar\u0101vaka\u201d\nAbhidharma texts that remain are the works of Vasubandhu and the\ncommentarial traditions stemming from them. It is tempting to take\nthis as evidence of Vasubandhu\u2019s philosophical mastery, to have\nso comprehensively defeated his foes that his tradition dominated from\nthe 9th century on. Yet we may equally take this as\nevidence not of the victory of Sautr\u0101ntika, but of the influence\nof the rising popularity of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra in India and Tibet.\nVasubandhu, a great systematizer of mainstream Abhidharma, provided\narguments and doctrines, and a life story, that paved the way to, and\njustified, the later dominance of Mah\u0101y\u0101na.\n\nVasubandhu wrote in Sanskrit, but many of his works are known from\ntheir Chinese and Tibetan translations alone. It is beyond the\npurposes of this essay to summarize all of the works attributed to\nVasubandhu, or to take into consideration the relevant criteria for\ndetermining his authorship. A quick mention of well-known works must\n suffice.[11]\n Vasubandhu\u2019s most important work of Abhidharma is his\nTreasury of the Abhidharma\n(Abhidharmako\u015bak\u0101rik\u0101), with its\nCommentary\n\n(Abhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya).[12]\n After these, his best known works are his concise, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\nsyntheses, the Twenty Verses\n(Vi\u1e43\u015bik\u0101k\u0101rik\u0101) with its\nCommentary (Vi\u1e43\u015bik\u0101v\u1e5btti), the\nThirty Verses (Tri\u1e43\u015bik\u0101), and the\nThree Natures Exposition\n (Trisvabh\u0101vanirde\u015ba).[13]\n The majority of the arguments discussed below are taken from these\nworks.\n\nA number of Vasubandhu\u2019s shorter independent works are also\navailable. The Explanation of the Establishment of Action\n(Karmasiddhiprakara\u1e47a) draws together, synthesizes and\nadvances somewhat the many discussions of karma from the\nTreasury of the Abhidharma\u2014adding a defense of the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra concept of the \u201cstorehouse\nconsciousness\u201d (\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na). The\nExplanation of the Five Aggregates\n(Pa\u00f1caskandhaprakara\u1e47a) is a summary of central\nAbhidharma terminology that includes some Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\ncross-referencing as well. The Rules for Debate\n(V\u0101davidhi) is lost, but numerous fragments preserved in\nlater texts show it to be foundational for the development of formal\nBuddhist logic and\n epistemology.[14]\n\nVasubandhu wrote a number of commentaries on Buddhist scriptures,\nprimarily (but not exclusively) those that are classified as\nMah\u0101y\u0101na S\u016btras. He also wrote a tremendously\ninfluential work on how to interpret and teach Buddhist scriptures,\nentitled the Proper Mode of Exposition\n(Vy\u0101khy\u0101yukti), in which (among other things) he\nargued for the legitimacy of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na S\u016btras (which\nhe called \u201cVaip\u016blya\n S\u016btras\u201d).[15]\n\nAlso quite influential, and still regularly studied in Tibetan\neducational settings, are Vasubandhu\u2019s commentaries on major\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra works. These include commentaries on three texts\nsaid to have been revealed to Asa\u1e45ga by the bodhisattva\nMaitreya, his Commentary on Distinguishing Elements from\nReality (Dharmadharmat\u0101vibh\u0101gav\u1e5btti),\nCommentary on Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremes\n(Madhy\u0101ntavibh\u0101gabh\u0101\u1e63ya), and\nCommentary on the Ornament to the Great Vehicle Discourses\n(Mah\u0101y\u0101nas\u016btr\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101rabh\u0101\u1e63ya).\nFinally, Vasubandhu is credited with an important commentary on\nAsa\u1e45ga\u2019s Yog\u0101c\u0101ra summa, the\nCommentary on the Summary of the Great Vehicle\n(Mah\u0101y\u0101nasa\u1e43grahabh\u0101\u1e63ya).\n\nAmong these works, and numerous others attributed to Vasubandhu in the\nTibetan and Chinese canons, one finds countless perspectives and\napproaches represented, and many scholars are skeptical as to the\nunity of the authorship even of the works listed. Many, however, still\nfind it sensible to assume that Vasubandhu worked in various genres\nand schools, and adopted the norms of each, developing his own\nthinking along the way. Yet no narrative of Vasubandhu\u2019s\nintellectual development has achieved scholarly consensus.\n",
