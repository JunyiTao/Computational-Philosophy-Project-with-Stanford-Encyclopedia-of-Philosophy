He employs the case of seeing\nthe very slight change (of the kind mentioned above) in the depiction\nof a smile within a picture of a monk looking at a vision of the\nVirgin Mary. Where the slight and subtle change of line yields a\ntransformation of the smile of the monk from a kindly to an ironic\none, our attitude in viewing might similarly change from one in which\nfor some we are almost in prayer to one that would for some be\nblasphemous, where we are almost leering. He then gives voice to his\nimagined reductive interlocutor, who says, \u201cWell there you\nare. It is all in the attitude\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 35), where\nwe would then focus, to the exclusion of all of the rest of the\nintricate, layered, and complex human dimensions of our reactions to\nworks, solely on an analysis of the attitude of the spectator and the\nisolable causal elements in the work that determine it. But that,\nagain, is only to give voice to a reductive impulse, and in the brief\nensuing discussion he shows, once again, that in some cases, an\nattitude of this kind may emerge as particularly salient. But in other\ncases, not. And he shows, here intertwining a number of his themes\nfrom these lectures, that the very idea of \u201ca description of an\nattitude\u201d is itself no simple thing. Full-blooded human beings,\nand not stimulus-response-governed automata, have aesthetic\nexperience, and that experience is as complex a part of our natural\nhistory as any other.\n\n\nWittgenstein ends the lectures discussing a simple heading: \u201cthe\ncraving for simplicity\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 36). To such a mind,\nhe says, if an explanation is complicated, it is disagreeable for that\nvery reason. A certain kind of mind will insist on seeking out the\nsingle, unitary essence of the matter, where\u2014much like Russell's\natomistic search for the essence of the logic of language beneath what\nhe regarded as its misleadingly and distractingly variegated\nsurface\u2014the reductive impulse would be given free\nreign. Wittgenstein's early work in the Tractatus (1961)\nfollowed in that vein. But in these lectures, given in 1938, we see a\nmind well into a transition away from those simplifying templates,\nthose conceptual pictures. Here, examples themselves do a\ngood deal of philosophical work, and their significance is that they\ngive, rather than merely illustrate, the philosophical point\nat hand. He said, earlier in the lectures, that he is trying to teach\na new way of thinking about aesthetics (and indeed about philosophy\nitself).\n",
