    "main_text": "Criticisms of Neoliberalism || Ethos Criticisms\n7.1 Ethos Criticisms\n\nMany criticize neoliberalism for structuring society around the\nmarket, commodifying market relations, and in general manipulating\npeople into serving the ends of what is best for commerce or economic\nproduction. In this way, neoliberalism builds society around a cash\nnexus. But unlike full capitalism, neoliberalism does so in a covert\nway that takes serious scholarly work to demonstrate. Neoliberalism\nitself is not an ethos, as noted above, but neoliberalism\nmight be seen to give rise to an excessively capitalist/transactional\nrelationship between persons. While she rejects this characterization\nof neoliberalism, Jessica Whyte argues that it is often characterized\nas\n\n\nan amoral economic ideology that subordinates all values to an\neconomic rationality, (2019: 19)\n\n\nfollowing a number of others, like Wendy Brown (2015). Here the\nanalysis draws heavily on Foucault (2010) where neoliberalism is said\nto reduce practical rationality to economic considerations, where\n\n\nthere is no difference between the infraction of the highway code and\na premeditated murder. (2015: 253\u20134)\n\n\nIndeed, one might make the more worrisome argument that neoliberalism\nleads not so much to selfish attitudes but towards bigoted,\nhierarchical, and traditional ones (Brown 2019: 7, 37).\n",
