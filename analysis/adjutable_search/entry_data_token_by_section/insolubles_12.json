    "main_text": "The Second Quarter of the Fourteenth Century || Thomas Bradwardine\n3.1 Thomas Bradwardine\n\nThomas Bradwardine (c. 1300\u20131349) wrote his Insolubles\nat Oxford sometime between 1321 and 1324. It became one of the most\nimportant works on the topic in the Middle Ages. In fact, in the late\n1350s, Ralph Strode, in his own treatise on the topic, surveys the\nearlier views (quoting Bradwardine\u2019s own survey and theory\nalmost verbatim), and then says (Spade 1981: 116):\n\n\nFor the opinions mentioned above were those of the old [logicians],\nwho understood little or nothing about insolubles. After them there\narose the prince of modern philosophers of nature, namely Master\nThomas Bradwardine. He was the first one who discovered something\nworthwhile about insolubles.\n\n\nBradwardine\u2019s theory is built around a distinctive theory of\ntruth, which in turn depends on a conception of signification,\ndescribed by Spade as an \u201cadverbial\u201d theory of\npropositional signification (Spade 2007: 180\u201387\n [Other Internet Resources];\n cf. Read 2008b: \u00a713.2). By virtue of their constituent terms,\npropositions signify things; but, in addition, a proposition as a\nwhole signifies that such-and-such is the case. This\nconception may be related to Walter Burley\u2019s theory of the\npropositio in re (see, e.g., Cesalli 2001). It is this latter\nkind of signification that is the basis for Bradwardine\u2019s theory\nof truth.\n\nFor Bradwardine, (D1) a proposition is true if it signifies\nonly as is the case (tantum sicut est), and (D2) it\nis false if it signifies otherwise than is the case (aliter quam\nest). Note the absence of the \u2018only\u2019 in the criterion\nfor falsehood. Truth therefore, is more demanding than falsehood. In\norder for a proposition to be true, all of what it signifies\nto be the case must in fact be the case; if any of what it\nsignifies to be the case fails to be the case, the\nproposition is false. He will then argue that insolubles signify more\nthan at first appears, and that not everything they signify can be the\ncase. Consequently, they are simply false.\n\nThus what is most distinctive in Bradwardine\u2019s theory is his\n\u201cmultiple-meanings\u201d theory of signification. For him,\npropositions signify many things, not in the sense of being ambiguous,\nbut as requiring a multitude of conditions to be satisfied for their\ntruth. For example, \u2018Some man is running\u2019 signifies not\nonly that a man is running, but also that there is a man, and a\nrunner. Indeed, Bradwardine claims that a proposition signifies\neverything which follows from it. This is his famous second postulate,\n(P2). There is considerable controversy over its correct\ninterpretation (for a careful discussion, see Dutilh Novaes 2009:\n\u00a71). (P2) is interpreted by Spade (1981:120) as what he calls\n\u201cBradwardine\u2019s Principle\u201d (BP):\n\n\nIf p only if q, then P signifies that\nq,\n\n\nwhere the name replacing \u2018P\u2019 names the sentence\nreplacing \u2018p\u2019. However, he concedes that, when read\nin this way, the principle does not support the proof Bradwardine\ngives of his second thesis, (T2), which we will discuss below.\nAccordingly, Spade attributes a further principle to Bradwardine, the\n\u201cConverse Bradwardine Principle\u201d\n (CBP):[19]\n\n\nWhatever a sentence signifies follows from it. If P signifies\nthat q, then p only if q.\n\n\nHowever, he admits that Bradwardine never states or mentions this\nprinciple, and that with it, Bradwardine\u2019s solution\ncollapses.\n\nIt is claimed in Read 2009 that (P2) should be interpreted more\ngenerously, not in terms of how it is actually stated by Bradwardine,\nbut how it is actually used by him. As used, it is a closure\nprinciple, that a proposition signifies everything which follows from\nwhat it signifies. This arguably has (BP) as a consequence, but is\nstronger than it, and sufficient for Bradwardine\u2019s proof of\n(T2).\n\nBradwardine\u2019s solution to the insolubles is stated in his second\nthesis, (T2): \u201cEvery proposition which signifies that it itself\nis not true, or is false, also signifies that it is true and is\nfalse\u201d. The proof has four stages (Bradwardine B-I\n\u00a76.6.1\u20136):\n\nsuppose first that a signifies that a is not true,\nand nothing else. If a is not true, then by (D1) it does not\nsignify only as is the case, so it is not the case that a is\nnot true (since we are supposing that is all it signifies), that is,\na is true. So if a is not true, it is true. But a\nsignifies that a is not true, so by (P2) a signifies\nthat it is true. Thus a does not and cannot signify only that\na is not true.\nSo suppose that a signifies that a is not true and\nalso that b is c. If a is not true, then by (D1)\nit does not signify only as is the case, so it is not the case that\na is not true and b is c, that is, either\na is true or b is not c, by (P4), a statement of\nthe De Morgan Laws. So again by (P2), a signifies either that\na is true or b is not c. But a signifies\nthat b is c, so by (P5), Disjunctive Syllogism, and (P2)\nagain, a signifies that a is true.\nsuppose that a signifies that a is false. Then by\n(P1), Bivalence, and (P2), a signifies that a is not\ntrue, so by (1) and (2) above, a signifies that a is\ntrue.\nso by steps 2 and 3, if a signifies that a is not\ntrue or that a is false, a also signifies that a\nis true. But a cannot be both true and false. So things cannot\nbe only as a signifies, so by (D2) a is false.\n\n\nIn the subsequent chapter, Ch. 7, Bradwardine considers the problem of\nrevenge in various guises. (See, e.g., the entry on the\n Liar paradox,\n and especially the section on\n Expressive power and \u2018revenge\u2019.)\n Take Socrates\u2019 utterance of \u2018Socrates utters a\nfalsehood\u2019, where Socrates utters nothing else.\nBradwardine\u2019s claim is that Socrates\u2019 utterance is false,\nthat is, that Socrates utters a falsehood. How can Bradwardine\u2019s\nclaim that Socrates utters a falsehood be true, while Socrates\u2019\nutterance of the same thing is false? The reason, Bradwardine replies,\nis that Socrates\u2019 utterance is self-referential, and signifies\nnot only that Socrates\u2019 utterance is false but also, by (T2),\nthat it is true (and so is false), whereas Bradwardine\u2019s\nutterance is not self-referential (rather, it refers to\nSocrates\u2019 utterance) and so not subject to (T2).\n",
