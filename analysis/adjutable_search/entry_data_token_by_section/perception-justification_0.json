    "main_text": "Theories of Experience\n1. Theories of Experience\n\nFor our purposes, a theory of perceptual experience aims to identify a\nfeature that is constitutive of perceptual experience: it is\nshared by all perceptual experiences, and identifies at least part of\ntheir nature. In this section, we will consider various potential\nlinks between theories of experience and the epistemology of\nperception that can be captured with the following template:\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link\n\nIf experiences justify beliefs about the external world, then\nexperiences have property \\(P\\).\n\nThe idea here is that experiences have to be a certain way in order to\njustify beliefs. Now, philosophers might accept a particular instance\nof the E-M Link, but disagree about whether experiences are the way\nthey need to be in order to justify beliefs about the external world.\nFor example, Davidson (1986) and McDowell (1994) agree that\nexperiences justify beliefs about the external world only if\nexperiences have contents that can be assessed for truth. Davidson\n(1986) argues that experiences do not justify beliefs about the\nexternal world on the grounds that they lack truth-assessable\ncontents, whereas McDowell (1994) argues that experiences must have\ntruth-assessable contents given that they justify beliefs about the\nexternal world (more on their dispute in\n subsection 1.2).\n\nWe can organize our discussion of such agreements and disagreements\naround the following trio of claims:\n\nEpistemology\n\nOur experiences justify beliefs about the external world.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link\n\nIf our experiences justify beliefs about the external world, then our\nexperiences have property \\(P\\).\n\nMind\n\nOur experiences do not have property \\(P\\).\n\nIf Epistemology and Epistemology-Mind Link are true, then Mind is\nfalse. Something will have to go. Approaches will vary according to\ntheir verdict on what exactly must go.\n\nIn what follows we survey the most prominent instances of the trio. We\nwill start with sense-data theories, then turn to raw feel theories,\nand theories on which experiences have propositional contents. We will\nclose the part by considering the conscious character of\nexperiences.\n\nOur survey of theories of experiences will not be exhaustive, but I\nwill briefly discuss an approach that complicates my framing of the\ndebates in terms of \u201cvisual experiences\u201d. Some have argued\nthat, when the ordinary shopper observes the lemon in the supermarket,\nher visual mental life is not as simple as it seems. In particular,\nrather than having a unitary visual experience, perhaps she has a\nvisual sensation and a visual seeming (Lyons 2005; Tucker 2010;\nBrogaard 2013; Reiland 2015; also Bengson 2015 as a fellow traveler).\nCall this the \u201chybrid\u201d picture of experience.\n\nTo get a feel for the hybrid picture, consider a contrast between an\nexpert bird-watcher and an ordinary perceiver, both observing a\nnorthern bobwhite. The hybrid theorist would say that they have the\nsame rudimentary visual sensation in some way involving colors and\nshapes, with only the expert has a visual seeming specifically to the\neffect that a northern bobwhite is present. Here the visual sensation\nshared by the expert and novice is sensory in character, but the\nseeming had only by the expert is itself not sensory. (For further\nexamples, see the opening of Tucker 2010).\n\nThe seeming might even be sharable in principle with subjects who lack\nvisual consciousness altogether (Tucker 2010, also Lyons 2005 with\ndifferent terminology, Brogaard 2013 however disagrees that visual\nseemings can be detached so far from visual sensation). That seemings\nare not sensory does not obviously entail that they are perceptually\namodal entirely, Lyons for instance seems to tie down his\n\u201cnonexperiential looks\u201d to different perceptual modalities\nsuch as vision or audition.\n\nThe example of the novice vs. the expert is suggestive, but what we\nhave said so far leaves open the respective natures of sensations and\nseemings, as well as of how visual experiences are to be understood in\nrelation to them. Given all of this indeterminacy, as well as the room\nfor debate about whether we even have good reason to complicate the\nstructure of visual experience in this way (see Chudnoff and\nDidomenico 2015 for criticisms), the discussion below will be framed\nsimply in terms of visual experiences. That said, the discussion\nshould remain applicable to experiences understood as combinations of\nsome sort of sensations and seemings. The discussion should also in\nprinciple be adaptable to apply individually to sensations only or to\nseemings only, depending on the reader\u2019s preferred category. At\nsome key stages we will explicitly highlight where the distinction\nmight be especially useful to apply and explore.\n",
