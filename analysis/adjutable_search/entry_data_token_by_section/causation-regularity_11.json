    "main_text": "Inferential Theories of Causation || Causal Model Approaches\n3. Conclusion\n\nRegularity theories of causation have lost acceptance among\nphilosophers to a considerable extent. One reason is David\nLewis\u2019s (1973) influential attack on the regularity approach\nwhich concludes that its prospects are dark. And indeed, the problem\nof spurious causation\u2014to pick just one\u2014was severe for the\nregularity and inferential theories back then. Mackie\u2019s INUS\naccount and simple deductive-nomological accounts alike cannot\nproperly distinguish genuine from spurious causes, for example in\ncommon cause scenarios. In the meantime, however, regularity and\ninferential theories have been developed that offer at least tentative\nsolutions to the problem of spurious causation, for instance\nBaumgartner (2013), Spohn (2012), and Andreas and G\u00fcnther (2020)\n(which are presented in\n \u00a71.4,\n \u00a72.2,\n \u00a72.3,\n respectively).\n\nAnother challenge is the direction of causation. David Lewis (1973,\n1979) thought that counterfactuals themselves yield an account of the\ndirection of causation. This account, however, turned out to be rather\ncontroversial and is rarely adopted (see, e.g., Frisch 2014: 204n). To\ndetermine the direction of causation, regularity and inferential\ntheories tend to rely on broadly Humean constraints on the temporal\norder between cause and effect. This move comes at the cost of\nexcluding backwards-in-time causation. We must wonder how severe this\nproblem is. So far, there is neither a commonly agreed understanding\nof the very idea of backwards causation nor actual empirical evidence\nfor it (cf. the entry on\n backwards causation).\n The direction of causation remains a point of controversy within\nregularity, inferential, and counterfactual approaches.\n\nTo conclude, the contemporary regularity and inferential theories have\nmade some remarkable progress. Valid criticisms have been largely\novercome and many causal scenarios\u2014which continue to be\nchallenging for counterfactual accounts of causation\u2014have been\nsolved. In particular, Baumgartner (2013), Beckers and Vennekens\n(2018), and Andreas and G\u00fcnther (2020) all solve the set of\nscenarios including overdetermination, early and late preemption, and\nswitches. In light of these recent developments, it should not be\nconsidered evident anymore that counterfactual theories of causation\nhave a clear edge over regularity and inferential theories.\n",
