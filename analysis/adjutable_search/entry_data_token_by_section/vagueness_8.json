    "main_text": "Global Indeterminacy without Local Indeterminacy\n9. Is All Vagueness Linguistic?\n\nSupervaluationists emphasize the distinction between words and\nobjects. Objects themselves do not seem to be the sort of thing that\ncan be general, ambiguous, or vague (Eklund 2011). From this\nperspective, Georg Hegel commits a category mistake when he\ncharacterizes clouds as vague. Although we sometimes speak of clouds\nbeing ambiguous or even being general to a region, this does not\nentitle us to infer that there is metaphysical ambiguity or\nmetaphysical generality.\n\nSupervaluationists are seconding a fallacy attribution dating back to\nBertrand Russell\u2019s seminal article \u201cVagueness\u201d\n(1923). This consensus was re-affirmed by Michael Dummett (1975) and\nritualistically re-avowed by subsequent commentators.\n\nIn 1978 Gareth Evans focused opposition to vague objects with a short\nproof modeled after Saul Kripke\u2019s attack on contingent identity.\nIf there is a vague object, then some statement of the form \u2018\\(a\n= b\\)\u2019 must be vague (where each of the flanking singular terms\nprecisely designates that object). For the vagueness is allegedly due\nto the object rather than its representation. But any statement of\nform \u2018\\(a = a\\)\u2019 is definitely true. Consequently, \\(a\\)\nhas the property of being definitely identical to \\(a\\). Since \\(a =\nb\\), then \\(b\\) must also have the property of being definitely\nidentical to \\(a\\). Therefore \u2018\\(a = b\\)\u2019 must be\ndefinitely true!\n\nEvans agrees that there are vague identity statements in which one of\nthe flanking terms is vague (just as Kripke agrees that there are\ncontingent identity statements when one of the flanking terms is a\nflaccid designator). But then the vagueness is due to language, not\nthe world.\n\nDespite Evans\u2019 impressive assault, there was a renewal of\ninterest in vague objects in the 1980s. As a precedent for this\nrevival, Peter van Inwagen (1990, 283) recalls that in the 1960s,\nthere was a consensus that all necessity is linguistic. Most\nphilosophers now take the possibility of essential properties\nseriously.\n\nSome of the reasons are technical. Problems with Kripke\u2019s\nrefutation of contingent identity have structural parallels that\naffect Evans\u2019 proof. Evans also relies on inferences that\ndeviant logicians challenge (Parsons 2000).\n\nIn the absence of a decisive reductio ad absurdum, many\nlogicians feel their role to be the liberal one of articulating the\nlogical space for vague objects. There should be \u2018vague objects\nfor those who want them\u2019 (Cowles and White 1991). Logic should\nbe ontologically neutral.\n\nSince epistemicists try to solve the sorites with little more than a\nresolute application of classical logic, they are methodologically\ncommitted to a partisan role for logic. Instead of looking for\nloopholes, we should accept the consequence (Williamson 2015).\n\nSome non-enemies of vague objects also have an ambition to consolidate\nvarious species of indeterminacy (Barnes and Williams 2011). Talk of\nindeterminacy is found in quantum mechanics, analyses of the open\nfuture, fictional incompleteness, and the continuum hypothesis.\nPerhaps vagueness is just one face of indeterminacy.\n\nThis panoramic vision contrasts with the continuing resolution of many\nto tether vagueness to the sorites paradox (Eklund 2011). They fear\nthat the clarity achieved by semantic ascent will be muddied by\nmetaphysics.\n\nBut maybe the mud is already on the mountain top. Trenton Merricks\n(2001) claims that standard characterizations of linguistic vagueness\nrely on metaphysical vagueness. If \u2018Donald is bald\u2019 lacks\na truth-value because there is no fact to make the statement true,\nthen the shortage appears to be ontological.\n\nThe view that vagueness is always linguistic has been attacked from\nother directions. Consider the vagueness of maps (Varzi 2001). The\nvagueness is pictorial rather than discursive. So one cannot conclude\nthat vagueness is linguistic merely from the premise that vagueness is\nrepresentational.\n\nOr consider vague instrumental music such as Claude Debussy\u2019s\n\u201cThe Clouds\u201d. Music has syntax but too little semantics to\nqualify as language. There is a little diffuse reference through\ndevices such as musical quotation, leitmotifs, and homages. These\nreferential devices are not precise. Therefore, some music is vague\n(Sorensen 2010). The strength and significance of this argument\ndepends on the relationship between music and language. Under the\nmusilanguage hypothesis, language and music branched off from a common\n\u201cmusilanguage\u201d with language specializing in semantics and\nmusic specializing in the expression of emotion. This scenario makes\nit plausible that purely instrumental music could have remnants of\nsemantic meaning.\n\nMental imagery also seems vague. When rising suddenly after a\nprolonged crouch, I \u2018see stars before my eyes\u2019. I can tell\nthere are more than ten of these hallucinated lights but I cannot tell\nhow many. Is this indeterminacy in thought to be reduced to\nindeterminacy in language? Why not vice versa? Language is an\noutgrowth of human psychology. Thus it seems natural to view language\nas merely an accessible intermediate bearer of vagueness.\n",
