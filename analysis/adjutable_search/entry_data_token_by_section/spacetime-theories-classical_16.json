    "main_text": "Leibniz || Leibniz\u2019s Response to Newton\u2019s Scholium\n6.5 Leibniz\u2019s Response to Newton\u2019s Scholium\n\nIt\u2019s again helpful to compare Leibniz with Descartes and Newton,\nthis time regarding motion. Commentators often express frustration at\nLeibniz\u2019s response to Newton\u2019s arguments for absolute\nspace: \u201cI find nothing \u2026 in the Scholium that\nproves or can prove the reality of space in itself. However, I grant\nthat there is a difference between an absolute true motion of a body\nand a mere relative change \u2026\u201d (LV.53). Not only does\nLeibniz apparently fail to take the argument seriously, he then goes\non to concede the step in the argument that seems to require absolute\nspace! But with our understanding of Newton and Leibniz, we can see\nthat what he says makes perfect sense (or at least that it is not as\ndisingenuous as it is often taken to be).\n\nNewton argues in the Scholium that true motion cannot be\nidentified with the kinds of motion that Descartes considers; but both\nof these are purely relative motions, and Leibniz is in complete\nagreement that merely relative motions are not true (i.e.,\n\u2018entirely real\u2019). Leibniz\u2019s \u2018concession\u2019\nmerely registers his agreement with Newton against Descartes on the\ndifference between true and relative motion; he surely understood who\nand what Newton was refuting, and it was a position that he had\nhimself, in different terms, publicly argued against at length. But as\nwe have seen, Leibniz had a very different analysis of the difference\nto Newton\u2019s; true motion was not, for him, a matter of motion\nrelative to absolute space, but the possession of quantity of force,\nontologically prior to any spatiotemporal quantities at all. There is\nindeed nothing in the Scholium explicitly directed against\nthat view, and since it does potentially offer an alternative way of\nunderstanding true motion, it is not unreasonable for Leibniz to claim\nthat there is no deductive inference from true motion to absolute\nspace.\n",
