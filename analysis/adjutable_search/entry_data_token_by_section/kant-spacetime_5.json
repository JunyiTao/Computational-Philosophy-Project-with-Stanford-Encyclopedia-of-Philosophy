    "main_text": "The \u201cMetaphysical Exposition\u201d || The content of our representation of space\n3.3 The content of our representation of space\n\nIn the third and fourth arguments, Kant contends that the\nrepresentation of space has a specifiable content that is incompatible\nwith it being a conceptual representation. That is, he argues that our\nrepresentation of space is not a concept, but is in fact an\nintuition\u2014it is a singular, immediate representation. As we have\nseen, the distinction between sensation and intuition indicates that\nthis claim does not amount to the idea that we have a sensation of\nspace (for reasons adduced above). Instead, it amounts to the claim\nthat we have an objective representation of space, but one that is\nsingular and immediate.\n\nIn order to understand the two arguments intended to establish the\nconclusion that we have a singular, immediate representation of space,\nit is helpful to recall Kant\u2019s attitude toward concepts. From\nhis point of view, whereas to fall \u201cunder\u201d a concept means\nto be part of a concept\u2019s extension, to fall\n\u201cwithin\u201d a concept means to be part of its intension. Just\nas significantly, the extension of a concept, in Kant\u2019s way of\nthinking, is not the things that instantiate the concept, or the set\nof things to which the concept \u201capplies\u201d; rather, it is\nthe class of concepts that function as sub-groupings falling under\nthis more general heading. This idea requires clarification.\n\nConsider the extension of\n <being>:[13]\n\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\nThe extension of <being> is those concepts on the conceptual\ntree that fall \u201cunder\u201d <being>\u2014those concepts\nare species of the genus, <being>. Kant speaks of a series of\ngenus-species relations inhering between the members of the class of\nconcepts that serve as a given concept\u2019s extension; whether a\nconcept serves as a genus or a species is relative. The concept\n<created> is a genus with respect to its species\n<material> and <immaterial>, but a species with respect to\nthe genus <being>. The intension of a concept consists\nof those concepts that collectively constitute it. Hence the concept\n<human> has this intension: \u201crational animate material\ncreated being.\u201d The concepts that collectively constitute a\ngiven concept are often called \u201cMerkmale\u201d or\n\u201cTeilbegriffe,\u201d or what might be called its conceptual\nparts (\u201cVienna Logic,\u201d Ak 24: 913). To construct the\nconcept <human>, one puts together the concepts\n<rational>, <animate>, <material>,\n<created>, and <being>. To formulate or to grasp the\nconcept <human> just is to grasp these\nconstituents.\n\nWith these distinctions in mind, we can consider Kant\u2019s third\nargument in the Metaphysical Exposition. In this argument, Kant\nconcentrates on the intension (in his sense) of a concept.\n\n3. Space is not a discursive, or as one says, general concept of\nrelations of things in general, but a pure intuition. For, firstly,\none can represent only one space, and if one speaks of many spaces,\none thereby understands only parts of one and the same unique space.\nThese parts cannot precede the one all-embracing space as being, as it\nwere, constituents out of which it can be composed, but can only be\nthought as in it. It is essentially one; the manifold in it,\nand therefore also the general concept of spaces, depends solely on\nlimitations. It follows from this that an a priori intuition\n(which is not empirical) underlies all concepts of space. Similarly,\ngeometrical propositions, that, for instance, in a triangle two sides\ntogether are greater than the third, can never be derived from the\ngeneral concepts of line and triangle, but only from intuition and\nindeed a priori with apodictic certainty. (A24\u20135/B39\u201340; cf.\n\u201cAnticipations of Perception\u201d at A169\u201370/B211)\n\n\nThe suggestion here is roughly this: if the representation of space\nwere a concept rather than an intuition, one ought to be able to\nconstruct it by placing its parts together. This seems to require that\nit is possible to represent the parts independently of representing\nthe concept to be constructed. This is the case with other concepts:\nit is possible to represent any of the parts of the intension of\n<human>, such as <material being>, without ipso\nfacto representing the whole concept, <human>. Kant is\nclaiming that this will not work in the case of the representation of\nspace because we obtain the representation of places only by\ndelimiting some subsection of our representation of the one\nall-encompassing space. To put the point in a way that highlights a\nparallel with the first argument of the Metaphysical Exposition: the\nrepresentation of any place presupposes the representation of space.\nThus we cannot represent any of the \u201cparts\u201d of\nspace\u2014any place\u2014without ipso facto representing\nspace itself. The idea, then, is that the part-whole relation of the\nrepresentation of space is distinct from the part-whole relation that\nobtains for concepts.\n\nIt is not clear that this argument is successful. It seems, e.g., to\nconflate the following: (1) the relation between space and its parts;\nand, (2) the relation between the representation of space and its\nconstituents. Without this conflation, it is not clear why we should\nexpect to construct our concept of space from our concept of place. It\nwould seem more sensible to construct our concept of space from other\nconcepts, such as that of infinity, or that of a magnitude, and so on,\nrather than from the concept of a place. The claim of the conflation\nis predicated on the notion that Kant\u2019s third argument concerns\nthe representation of space rather than space itself. This notion, in\nturn, may conflict with the letter, although perhaps not with the\nspirit, of the first sentence of the third argument, which mentions\nthat \u201cDer Raum,\u201d or space, is not a concept, but rather is\nan intuition. If one follows the letter of the argument, one can avoid\nthis apparent conflation. But the price is somewhat high: what does it\nmean to wonder whether space itself is a concept, and who held\nsomething like that view? On the face of it, such a view may seem\nrather odd to the contemporary\n reader.[14]\n One way to make progress in understanding this view is to re-read\nLeibniz. It is possible to read Leibniz as arguing that space itself\nis a kind of abstraction, rather than a real entity or substance, and\nperhaps it is not a stretch to contend that space must be a conceptual\nabstraction, like the entities of what Leibniz might call pure\nmathematics. That is, space itself, on this view, is a kind of\nconceptual abstraction in the way that an isosceles triangle is an\nabstraction, or a line is an abstraction, rather than a real entity or\nsubstance. Of course, this requires us to understand Leibniz\u2019s\nposition through a Kantian lens. Even so, if the view in focus is that\nspace itself is a kind of concept, it remains unclear why one\nwouldn\u2019t say that this concept is dependent on other\nconstitutive concepts, such as the concept of infinity or that of\nhomogeneity, which Kant himself tackles in the next numbered argument.\nPerhaps the best answer here is to read Kant as engaging specifically\nwith Leibniz\u2019s argument in his last (fifth) exchange with\nClarke, mentioned above. The idea is that Leibniz\u2019s argument\nmight be understood as involving the claim that the concept of place\nis constitutive of the concept of space, and that space itself is\nreally nothing but a kind of concept, which licenses the exclusive\nfocus on the concept of space. Then the claim would be that the\nLeibnizian view that space itself is a conceptual abstraction obtained\nthrough some process of perceiving objects occupying various places is\nwrong on both counts.\n\nJust as Kant\u2019s second argument attempts to shore-up the idea,\npresented in the first argument, that the representation of space is\na priori, his fourth and final argument attempts to shore-up\nthe idea, presented in the third argument, that the representation of\nspace is not conceptual in character. Here both the extension and the\nintension of concepts seem to be at issue:\n\n4. Space is represented as an infinite given magnitude. Now\none must think every concept as a representation which is contained in\nan infinite number of different possible representations (as their\ncommon mark), and which therefore contains these under\nitself; but no concept, as such, can be thought as if it\ncontained an infinite number of representations within\nitself. It is in this latter way, however, that space is thought\n(for all the parts of space are simultaneous in infinity [denn alle\nTeile des Raumes ins Unendliche sind zugleich]). Therefore the\noriginal representation of space is an a priori intuition,\nnot a concept (B40).\n\n\nKant claims that since we represent space as containing an infinite\nnumber of places within it, our representation of space cannot be\nconceptual. Why should that be? The idea is that although concepts can\nhave an infinite extension\u2014a potentially infinite number of\nsubordinate concepts under them\u2014they cannot have an\ninfinite intension, an infinite number of representations\nwithin them. A concept that is infinite in the latter sense\ncould not be grasped by a finite\n mind.[15]\n For a concept to have an infinite extension would be for it to have\nan infinite number of species, i.e. for it to be possible to\ndistinguish an infinite number of sub-types \u201cunder\u201d it on\nthe conceptual tree. This does not harm our ability to grasp any\nconcept within the tree, for to grasp any arbitrarily chosen concept\nwithin the tree, I merely need to grasp its constituents (those\nconcepts within it), and those would be \u201cabove\u201d\nit on the tree. But our ability to grasp concepts would be affected if\nthey could contain an infinite number of constituents within\nthemselves: if, say, <fish> contained an infinite number of\nconstituents\u2014if there were an infinite number of higher-level\nconceptual taxa \u201cabove\u201d <fish> on the tree\u2014it\ncould not be grasped, and might even lack determinate content. Or at\nleast, to specify its content would take an infinite number of\nsteps.\n\nAccording to Kant, however, we represent space as having an infinite\nnumber of constituents, namely\n places.[16]\n If our representation of space were conceptual, we would be required\nto represent each of these constituents in order to represent\nspace itself, just as we are required to represent metal in order\nto represent gold (for <gold> catergorizes gold as a metal). Yet\nwe cannot represent every place within space in an effort to represent\nspace itself. If we can take it as settled that we represent space,\nand as settled that we represent it as having an infinite number of\nplaces within it, then our representation of space presumably cannot\nbe conceptual in Kant\u2019s sense. The third argument in the\nMetaphysical Exposition seems to imply, as we have seen, that the\nrepresentation of any place presupposes the representation of space\nitself. This fourth argument makes a distinct point: if the\nrepresentation of space itself were to require the representation of\neach part that we represent space as having, then we could not\nrepresent space at all. Since we do represent space, and since we do\nrepresent it as having an infinite number of places within it, our\nrepresentation of space is not conceptual in Kant\u2019s sense. Of\ncourse, Kant\u2019s readers may deny one of his apparent assumptions\nhere, viz., that we represent space as infinite. Readers with broadly\nempiricist sympathies in particular may be skeptical of this\nassumption.\n\nKant\u2019s view that we have an intuition, rather than a concept, of\nspace can be seen to raise a difficult problem: space is not an\nobject, and yet intuition seems to provide us with something akin to a\nperception of something. As Lucy Allais puts it, intuition involves\n\u201cpresence to consciousness of an object\u201d (Allais 2015,\n197ff), and yet space is not an object. It is difficult to\nsee why we should think of ourselves as perceiving space at all. It is\neasy enough to understand the idea that some ordinary thing, like a\ntomato, is an object that is present to my consciousness, say when I\nlook at the tomato on a farm stand. There are, of course, many\nphilosophical theories of perception, and these theories will differ\nin their discussions even of simple cases of perception such as this\none. But it seems uncontroversial to suppose that the tomato is\npresent to my consciousness as an object at least in the sense that\nthe tomato is one of the things that I\u2019m looking at. And it also\nseems uncontroversial to think that there are many other things,\nbesides tomatoes, that might be present to my consciousness in a\nsimilar way, from clouds to fog to rainbows, even though they are not\n\u201cobjects\u201d in the simple sense in which a tomato is an\nobject. However, it certainly seems like a stretch to say that space\nitself might be one of those things. That is not merely because space\nis not an object in any clear sense; it is also because space itself,\nin this historical and philosophical context, is not something that\nhas a causal impact on me. So it remains doubly difficult to see how I\nmight conclude, with Kant, that I have something akin to a perception\nof space. Kant assures us, of course, that we have an a\npriori intuition of space, so although he is discussing something\nakin to perception in one sense, in another sense what he is\ndiscussing is supposed to be quite distinct from ordinary perception.\nWhether that assurance helps to clarify this issue for his readers is\na matter of debate. What is clear, however, is that this aspect of\nKant\u2019s conception of space remains one of the most\ncontroversial, and most difficult, aspects of his theoretical\nphilosophy.\n\nKant may have other reasons for thinking that our representation of\nspace is not a concept. If we recall Kant\u2019s view that concepts\nare general, mediate representations, and his view of how these facts\nare reflected in the conceptual trees discussed above, then there is\nindeed at least a prima facie puzzle as to how we could have\na concept, in Kant\u2019s sense, of space. Consider a contrast class.\nEven if we think that <God> represents only a single entity,\nthat fact does not undermine Kant\u2019s view that this concept is a\ngeneral, mediate representation (cf. Thompson 1972, 318\u201319, 328\u201329).\nFor we represent God, in Kant\u2019s view, by representing it through\nother concepts: for instance, God is a necessary substance\n(A678/B706), so <God> is a mediate representation. This is\ndistinct from the way in which an intuition represents something. And\nthe concept <substance>\u2014which is one of the\ncategories (A80/B106)\u2014is a representation that we can grasp\nindependently of grasping <God>. Hence <substance> is a\nconstituent of <God>, but not vice versa. Moreover,\n<God> is a general representation because it places God\nwithin another class, namely the class of substances. It will then be\na matter of some dispute whether the generality criterion and\nthe mediacy criterion amount to the same thing (cf. Parsons\n1992, 63\u20136). But the key point here is this: the fact that\n<God> picks out a single individual\u2014and perhaps even,\ncan pick out only a single individual\u2014does not entail\nthat this concept is not general or mediate. This suggests, in turn,\nthat Kant\u2019s point in the Metaphysical Exposition cannot be that\nour representation of space picks out a single individual and\ntherefore cannot be a concept. Rather, he presumably thinks that we do\nnot represent space either: (1) by representing its constituents,\nnamely places; or (2) by representing it through other\nconcepts. We have discussed (1) above; what about (2)?\n\nConcerning (2), note that to represent space by representing it\nthrough other concepts may require one to take a (usually\ncontroversial) stand on the ontology of space in one of the senses\noutlined above. For instance, if one wishes to place <space>\nsomewhere on the conceptual tree, one must presumably find a place for\nit under some concept such as <substance> or <being>. But\nthere is no accepted view of space\u2019s ontology: some regard it as\na substance (or a being), others as a network of relations, others as\na property of God, etc. Because of these long-standing, unresolved\ndisputes, it seems reasonable to regard an approach that depends on\ntheir resolution as unpromising. Kant highlights the accepted fact\nthat we represent space as an infinite Euclidean magnitude\u2014this\ncan be widely accepted, despite the dispute concerning space\u2019s\nontology.\n\nAnother way to clarify Kant\u2019s arguments regarding conceptuality\nis to consider what opponent he has in mind for the second two\narguments. It seems unlikely that Locke\u2019s views are at issue in\nthese arguments\u2014instead, Kant probably had Leibniz in mind.\nLeibniz held the view that the idea (or representation) of space hails\nfrom the pure understanding, which he contrasts with the kind of\nLockean view noted above. He writes in the New Essays:\n\n\nPHILALETHES: The ideas the perception of which comes to us \u201cby\nmore than one sense, are of space, or extension, figure, motion and\nrest.\u201d\n\nTHEOPHILUS: These ideas, which are said to come from more than one\nsense \u2013 like those of space, figure, motion \u2013 come rather\nfrom the common sense, which is to say, from the mind itself; for they\nare ideas of the pure understanding, though ones which relate to the\nexternal world and which the senses make us perceive, and so they\nadmit of definitions and demonstrations. (New Essays, 128;\nsee Leibniz 1840, 230)\n\n\nLeibniz may have in mind the idea that our perceptions cannot give us\nthe idea of a continuum, and he certainly thinks of space as a\ncontinuum. The senses, for instance, cannot give us the idea of\nsomething that is infinitely divisible. Elsewhere in the New\nEssays, Leibniz makes a related point by saying that space is\nakin to the entities of \u201cpure mathematics.\u201d\n\nOne question here is whether Leibniz and Kant agree sufficiently in\ntheir views of concepts for Kant\u2019s arguments to have any bite\nagainst the kind of view Leibniz expresses in the New Essays,\na text that Kant read sometime after it was first available in 1765\n(Vaihinger 1922, 2: 133, 414 and 428\u20139). Leibniz, famously, has the\nidea of a complete concept of a substance, and it seems that such as\nconcept would contain an infinite number of constituents\u2014God\ngrasps the complete concept of a substance by grasping all its\nconstituents. Given this view, it may be that the considerations\nadduced in Kant\u2019s fourth argument in the Metaphysical Exposition\nare unlikely to worry Leibniz, since he would simply accept the idea\nthat the representation of space, as with any concept, might have an\ninfinite number of constituents (Posy 2000). However, the third\nargument may have more bite: if Kant is right in contending that the\nrepresentation of any place presupposes the representation of space\nitself, then perhaps that representation lacks the ordinary part-whole\nstructure of a concept. Leibniz may in fact accept that general\nconception of the part-whole structure of concepts. If so, this third\nargument may present a problem for his view.\n\nYet the first and second arguments of the Exposition are not merely\nopportunities to contend with empiricist views like those of Locke;\nnor are the third and fourth arguments merely aimed at challenging\nrationalist views like those of Leibniz. On the contrary, the claim\nthat the representation of space is neither empirical nor conceptual\nis important in general for Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism and,\nin tandem, it is significant for understanding what he regards as the\nphilosophical mistakes embodied in transcendental realism, and in what\nKant will later call \u201cdogmatic idealism,\u201d both of which he\nstrongly opposes. These are discussed in the next section.\n",
