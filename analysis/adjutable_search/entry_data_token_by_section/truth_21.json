    "main_text": "Deflationism || Minimalist theories\n5.2 Minimalist theories\n\nThe equivalence principle looks familiar: it has something like the\nform of the Tarski biconditionals discussed in section 2.2.\nHowever, it is a stronger principle, which identifies the two sides of\nthe biconditional \u2013 either their meanings or the speech acts\nperformed with them. The Tarski biconditionals themselves are simply\nmaterial biconditionals.\n\nA number of deflationary theories look to the Tarski biconditionals\nrather than the full equivalence principle. Their key idea is that\neven if we do not insist on redundancy, we may still hold the\nfollowing theses:\n\nFor a given language \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) and every \\(\\phi\\) in\n\\(\\mathbf{L}\\), the biconditionals \\(\\ulcorner \\ulcorner \\phi\n\\urcorner\\) is true if and only if \\(\\phi \\urcorner\\) hold by\ndefinition (or analytically, or trivially, or by stipulation\n\u2026).\nThis is all there is to say about the concept of truth.\n\n\nWe will refer to views which adopt these as minimalist.\nOfficially, this is the name of the view of Horwich (1990), but we\nwill apply it somewhat more widely. (Horwich\u2019s view differs in\nsome specific respects from what is presented here, such as\npredicating truth of propositions, but we believe it is close enough\nto what is sketched here to justify the name.)\n\nThe second thesis, that the Tarski biconditionals are all there is to\nsay about truth, captures something similar to the redundancy\ntheory\u2019s view. It comes near to saying that truth is not a\nproperty at all; to the extent that truth is a property, there is no\nmore to it than the disquotational pattern of the Tarski\nbiconditionals. As Horwich puts it, there is no substantial underlying\nmetaphysics to truth. And as Soames (1984) stresses, certainly nothing\nthat could ground as far-reaching a view as realism or\nanti-realism.\n",
