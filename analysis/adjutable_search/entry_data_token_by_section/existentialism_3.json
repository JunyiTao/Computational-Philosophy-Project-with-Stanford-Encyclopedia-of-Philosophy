    "main_text": "Engagement vs. Detachment || Perspectivism\n2.2 Perspectivism\nNietzsche echoes Kierkegaard\u2019s misgivings about\nmethodological detachment and philosophical systems but he does so by\nforwarding a pragmatic and perspectival account of truth. He argues\nthat philosophers don\u2019t discover objective truths by means of\ndetached reasoning because truth claims are always shaped by and\nembedded in specific sociohistorical contexts. Truths, for Nietzsche,\nare best understood as social constructs; they are created or invented\nby a historical people, and they endure only so long as they are\nsocially useful. On Nietzsche\u2019s account, truths are passed down\nhistorically for generations to the point where they are uncritically\naccepted as \u201cfacts.\u201d But from the standpoint of\nperspectivism, \u201cfacts are precisely what there is not, [there\nare] only interpretations. [The world] has no meaning behind it, but\ncountless meanings\u201d (Nietzsche 1901 [1968], \u00a7481).\nNietzsche\u2019s genealogy is one that shows how the history of\nWestern philosophy is largely a history of forgetting how truths are\ninvented. \u201cIt is only by means of forgetfulness,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201cthat man can ever reach the point of fancying himself to\npossess a \u2018truth\u2019\u201d (Nietzsche 1889a [1990a],\n\u00a793). This means human beings are already bound up in socially\nconstructed perspectives that they cannot disengage or detach from. To\nexist, then, is to live in one\u2019s \u201cown perspectival forms,\nand only in them. We cannot see around our own corner\u201d\n(Nietzsche 1887 [1974], \u00a7374). There is no aperspectival\n\u201creality.\u201d The epistemological distinction between\n\u201cappearance\u201d and \u201creality\u201d is a pseudo-problem\nthat is always parasitic on the perspectival forms that we\ninhabit.\nNietzsche goes on to suggest there is a psychological motivation in\nour shared belief in objective truth. It shelters us from the\nterrifying contingency and mutability of existence. Nietzsche\nunderstands that human beings are vulnerable and frightened creatures,\nand the belief in truth\u2014even though it is an illusion\u2014has\nsocial and pragmatic utility by providing a measure of coherence and\nreliability. We need these truths for psychological protection, to help\nus cope with an otherwise chaotic and precarious existence.\n\u201cTruth,\u201d therefore, \u201cis that sort of error without\nwhich a certain species of life could not live\u201d (Nietzsche 1901\n[1968], \u00a7493). \n",
