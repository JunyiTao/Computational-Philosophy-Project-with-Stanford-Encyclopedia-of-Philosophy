    "main_text": "Criticism || Microrealization-robustness\n6.4 Fallacies\n\n\nThe primary methodological reason, among social scientists, for adopting\na commitment to methodological individualism was to caution against\ncertain fallacies (ones that were quite common in 19th\ncentury social science). Perhaps the greatest of these fallacies was\nthe one based on a widespread tendency to ignore the potential for\ncollective action problems in groups, and thus to move far too easily\n\u201cdown\u201d from an identification of a group interest to the\nascription of an individual interest. One way of avoiding such\nfallacies was to force social scientists to look always at\ninteractions from the participant\u2019s perspective, to see what sort of\npreference structure governed his or her decisions.\n\n\nAt the same time, it is worth noting that too much emphasis on the\naction-theoretic perspective can generate its own fallacies. One of\nthe most powerful resources of sociological inquiry is precisely the\ncapacity to objectivate and aggregate social behavior using\nlarge-scale data collection and analysis. The analysis of\nsocial phenomena at this level can often generate results that are\ncounterintuitive from an action-theoretic perspective. Too much\nemphasis on the action-theoretic perspective, because of its proximity\nto common sense, can generate false assumptions about what must be\ngoing on at the aggregate level. As Arthur Stinchcombe observes in his\nclassic work, Constructing Social Theories, constructing\n\u201cdemographic explanations\u201d of social phenomena often\nrequires a break with our everyday interpretive perspective. Too much\nfocus upon individual attitudes can lead us to make illegitimate\ngeneralizations about the characteristics of these attitudes in groups\n(1968, 67). For example, the stability of a belief in a population\nonly very rarely depends upon its stability in individuals. There can\nbe considerable volatility at the individual level, but so long as it\nruns with equal force both ways, its prevalence in the population will\nbe unchanged (68). If ten per cent of the population loses their faith\nin God every year, yet ten per cent have a conversion experience, then\nthere will be no change in the overall level of religiosity. This may\nseem obvious, but as Stinchcombe observes, it is \u201cintuitively\ndifficult for many people\u201d (67), and inattention to it is a\ncommon source of fallacious sociological thinking.\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that the action-theoretic level of analysis,\nwith its focus upon the intentional states of the agent, can generate\nconsiderable mischief when combined haphazardly with evolutionary\nreasoning. The most common fallacy arises when theorists treat the\n\u201cself-interest\u201d of the individual, defined with respect to\nhis or her preferences, as a stand-in for the \u201cfitness\u201d of\na particular behavior (or phenotype), at either the biological or the\ncultural level, then assumes that there is some selection mechanism in\nplace, again at either the biological or cultural level, that will\nweed out forms of behavior that fail to advance the individual\u2019s\nself-interest. The problem is that neither biological nor cultural\nevolution function in this way. It is an elementary consequence of\n\u201cselfish gene\u201d theory that biological evolution does not\nadvance the interests of the agent (the most conspicuous example being\ninclusive fitness). For similar reasons, cultural evolution benefits\nthe \u201cmeme\u201d rather than the interests of the agent\n(Stanovich 2004). Thus the evolutionary perspective imposes a much\ngreater break with the rationality-based perspective than many social\ntheorists appreciate. Thus methodological individualism can sometimes\nimpede the sort of radical objectivation of social phenomena that the\nuse of certain sociotheoretic models or tools requires.\n",
