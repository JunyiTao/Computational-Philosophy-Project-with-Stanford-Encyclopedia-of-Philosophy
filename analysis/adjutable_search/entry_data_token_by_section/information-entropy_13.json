Information Processing Using Statistical Mechanics\n\n\nIn his earliest paper, Landauer derived the cost of performing the\nreset operation by simply assuming that there is an equivalence\nbetween the Shannon information of a distribution of logical states,\nand thermodynamic entropy of a physical system that can represent\nthose logical states. A reduction in the Shannon information content\nof the logical states would then reduce the thermodynamic entropy of\nthe physical system. Landauer then further assumed that the second law\nholds true and that this reduction must produce a thermodynamic\nentropy increase elsewhere. Viewed in this way, his argument appears\nto contain elements both of the profound and the sound horns of Earman\nand Norton's (1998, 1999) dilemma. It follows the profound horn in\nidentifying Shannon information with thermodynamic entropy and the\nsound horn in assuming the validity of the second law.\n\n\nIt is less clear that Landauer himself thought he was introducing a\nnew principle. It seems more plausible that he was taking for granted\nthe Gibbsian approach to statistical mechanics, which identified\np\u2009ln\u2009p as the statistical\nmechanical entropy long before Shannon's work, and the non-decrease of\nthis entropy through coarse-graining. As such, the validity of\nLandauer's principle would still require the structure of Gibbsian\nstatistical mechanics to be self-consistent and the appropriate\nrepresentation of thermal systems. At the very least this cannot be\ntaken for granted unless it has already been established that untamed\ndemons do not exist and so the unquestioned use of Landauer's\nprinciple in exorcisms of the demon would still appear to be\ncircular.\n\n\nNevertheless, this cannot be taken to imply that analysing the\nthermodynamics of computation is an altogether pointless task. The\nquestion of whether or not one can deduce thermodynamic consequences of\nphysically implementing logical operations, from the structure of the\nlogical operation itself, may be a well-founded question (although it\nclearly cannot be wholly divorced from what fundamental physics says\nabout the construction of such devices). Furthermore, were it to be\nshown that Landauer's principle was not correct, and that\ninformation could be reset at arbitrarily low cost, it would seem that\neither untamed demons must be possible or some further source\nof heat generation must be discovered in the operation of Szilard's\nengine.\n\n\nAt one extreme, von Neumann argued that any logical operation\nnecessarily generated a minimum quantity of heat. Gabor and Brillouin\nhad argued that measurement, at least, generated heat. Landauer and\nBennett argued that only logically irreversible operations need\ngenerate heat, but that measurement is logically reversible. This was\nbacked up by the presentation of physical processes that could, in\nprinciple, perform a measurement with arbitrarily little heat\ngeneration. Bennett argued that while the measurement processes\ndiscussed by Gabor and Brillouin, using scattered light, generate\nheat, they were incorrect to generalise this to the claim that all\nmeasurement process must necessarily do the same. However, a similar\ncharge may be levelled at Landauer's principle. Although explicit\nmodels for resetting operations have been constructed that get\narbitrarily close to a minimum heat generation\nof k\u2009T\u2009ln\u20092, what is needed is\na proof that no physical process can do better. A literature now\nexists examining the strength of this claim, and in particular what\nare the physical and statistical assumptions underpinning their\narguments.\n",
