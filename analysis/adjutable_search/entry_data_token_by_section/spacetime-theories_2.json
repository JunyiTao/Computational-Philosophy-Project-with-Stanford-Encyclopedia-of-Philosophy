    "main_text": "Mach || Implementing Mach-heavy\n1.2 Implementing Mach-heavy\n\nDirect assault on the problem of satisfying Mach-heavy in a classical\nframework proved unsuccessful for a long time, despite the efforts of\nothers besides Mach \u2013 for example, Friedl\u00e4nder (1896),\nF\u00f6pl (1904), and Reissner (1914, 1915). (Between the late 19th\ncentury and the 1970s, there was of course one extremely important\nattempt to satisfy Mach-heavy: the work of Einstein that led to the\nGeneral Theory of Relativity. Since Einstein\u2019s efforts took\nplace in a non-classical (Lorentz/Einstein/Minkowski) spacetime\nsetting, we discuss them in the next section.) One very influential\napproach to implementing Mach-heavy was promulgated in the work of\nBarbour and Bertotti (1977); this has since developed into the\nresearch programme of \u2018shape dynamics\u2019, and will be\ndiscussed in more detail in section 3 below.\n",
