    "main_text": "\n\n\nJudah ben Samuel Halevi (c. 1075\u20131141) was the premier Hebrew\npoet of his generation in medieval Spain. Over the course of some\nfifty years, from the end of the 11th century to the middle\nof the 12th, he wrote nearly 800 poems, both secular and\nreligious. However, because this was a time of intensifying religious\nconflict characterized by physical, social, and political upheaval,\nHalevi also sought to develop a reasoned defense of the Jewish\nreligion, which was then under attack on all fronts. Christians and\nMuslims dismissed Judaism as a superseded religion and reviled its\nadherents as guilty of both blindness and faithlessness. Those more\ninclined to philosophy, inside as well as outside the Jewish faith,\nfound many more points to contest. For some, these included even the\nmost fundamental teachings of Judaism, such as God's creation of the\nworld and his involvement in the affairs of mere flesh and blood,\nwhich they regarded as perplexing, at best, or incredible\naltogether.\n\n\nAs a young man, Halevi had studied philosophy, and he continued to\nfollow its evolution in Spain as newer Aristotelian ideas began to\ncirculate among the courtier classes. However, his reactions to what\nhe learned were decidedly mixed. As a trained physician, he certainly\nappreciated the high premium that the philosophers placed on careful\nobservation and clear thinking. Lives were saved thanks to such skills\nor lost when they were lacking. He also admired the philosophers'\nachievements in the formal disciplines of logic and mathematics,\ninasmuch as they came as close to generating certainty as anyone could\nhave hoped. Yet this achievement was also part of a larger\nproblem. Halevi knew that since its inception philosophy had made the\npursuit of truth in every domain its highest goal.  It persistently\nsought to distinguish between opinion and knowledge in order to\nreplace opinions about all things with knowledge of all things. To the\nextent that this project could succeed, those able to acquire such\nknowledge, whether theoretical or practical, would presumably be of\none mind about the truth they came to know and also live their lives\nin accordance with it. However, Halevi also came to realize that well\nbefore the goal is ever reached, opinions, conventions, and traditions\nof all kinds as well as the practices associated with them, would be\nrendered questionable or otherwise suspect, because they were not\nknown philosophically to be true or right. A\nconsequence of this demotion in status of everything unproved was that\nthose best equipped intellectually to examine and judge such matters\ncould, and often did, believe, or allow others to believe, that they\nhad the requisite knowledge of exactly what others lacked by virtue of\ntheir mastery of logic, theory, and other intellectual\nskills. Whether, in fact, lovers of wisdom were also as wise as many\nof them or their proponents claimed seemed far from obvious to\nHalevi. But how could he even discuss such abstract issues in a work\nintended to vindicate the Jewish faith in a time of crisis? How,\nindeed, was he to give a reasoned account and defense of Judaism to\nhis increasingly dispirited or doubting co-religionists, when the\nchallenges came from so many different directions? Their detractors\nhad the prestige of power, numbers, worldly success, and specialized\nnew knowledge to support their claims, while the Jews had only their\nhistory, traditions, and what remained of their faith to fall back\nupon.\n\n\nUltimately, Halevi opted for a novel, yet entirely appropriate,\nsolution. He let a widely-attested fact of recent history make the\ncase for him\u2014the conversion of the Khazar kingdom to Judaism\nalmost four centuries earlier. The story was well known, even if less\nstirring than it was when it first circulated in Spain.  Obviously,\nthe Khazar king and his people had other, more influential, religious\nalternatives to choose from, but they chose Judaism nonetheless\nbecause of a truth that they saw as unique to it.  Surely, the king\nmust have discussed all this; and if he did, so could\nHalevi\u2014within the framework of a dialogue. Indeed, such an\napproach would allow him to examine all of the relevant issues in the\ncourse of an on-going series of conversations, just as they are so\noften encountered and discussed in real life. What is more, the real\nexperiences of the past, now presented with the help of all his poetic\ngifts, could be drawn upon to refute the calumnies and answer the\nobjections raised in the present. Through this connection with an\nevent in history, Halevi's Book of Refutation and Proof on Behalf\nof the Despised Religion came to be known more simply as the\nKuzari. Under that title, his book would also become the\nemblematic expression of the lived truths of his people and their\nfaith as these were experienced throughout their history, and, not\nsurprisingly, one of the most beloved works of the Jewish intellectual\nheritage.\n",
