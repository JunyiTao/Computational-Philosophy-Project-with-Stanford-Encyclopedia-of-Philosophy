    "main_text": "Donor Anonymity || Medical Records\n2.2 Medical Records\n\nAnother reason offered for prohibiting anonymous gamete donation is\nthat it prevents donor-conceived individuals from making health\ndecisions informed by family medical history. If individuals are not\ninformed about being donor-conceived, they risk making medical\ndecisions on the incorrect assumption that their social family\u2019s\nmedical background reflects their own. And even if such individuals\nare informed that they are donor-conceived, they still suffer from an\nabsence of medical information that is generally available to others\n(Ravitsky 2012). While it is true that medical information could be\nprovided at the time of donation in a manner that preserves the\nanonymity of the donor, some argue that, as our understanding of\ncongenital disease changes, new information is likely to become\nrelevant (Leighton 2014; McGee, Brakeman, & Gurmankin 2001).\nAdditionally, certain relevant medical conditions might only become\napparent long after the donation. While a system could be put in place\nfor donors to update their medical information, some argue that such a\nsystem would likely be too cumbersome for donor-conceived individuals\nto receive the medical information they need in a timely fashion\n(McGee, Brakeman, & Gurmankin 2001).\n\nHowever, those who defend the permissibility of donor anonymity argue\nthat the value of medical history is overstated, and will become less\nimportant as we move towards personalized medicine (Melo-Mart\u00edn\n2014). In fact, in a report recommending against permitting\ndonor anonymity, the UK\u2019s Nuffield Council on Bioethics stated\nthat medical interests alone were not sufficient grounds for\nprohibiting donor anonymity (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2013).\n",
