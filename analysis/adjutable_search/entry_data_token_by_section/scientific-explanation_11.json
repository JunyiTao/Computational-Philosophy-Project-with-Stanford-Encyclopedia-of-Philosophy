    "main_text": "The Causal Mechanical Model || The CM Model and Explanatory Relevance\n4.2 The CM Model and Explanatory Relevance\n\nAs the billiard example illustrates, the CM model takes as\nits paradigms of causal interaction examples such as collisions in\nwhich there is \u201caction by contact\u201d and no spatio-temporal\ngaps in the transmission of causal influence. There is little doubt\nthat explanations in which there are no such gaps (no \u201caction at\na distance\u201d) often strike us as particularly satisfying.\nHowever, as Christopher Hitchcock shows in an illuminating paper\n(Hitchcock 1995), even here the CM model leaves out something\nimportant. Consider the usual elementary textbook \u201cscientific\nexplanation\u201d of the motion of the balls in the above example\nfollowing their collision. This explanation proceeds by deriving that\nmotion from information about their masses and velocity before the\ncollision, the assumption that the collision is perfectly elastic, and\nthe law of the conservation of linear momentum. We usually think of\nthe information conveyed by this derivation as showing that it is the\nmass and velocity of the balls, rather than, say, the scratches on\ntheir surface or chalk that may be transmitted by the cue stick that\nis explanatorily relevant to their subsequent motion. However, it is\nhard to see what in the CM model allows us to pick out the\nlinear momentum of the balls, as opposed to these other features, as\nexplanatorily relevant. Part of the difficulty is that to express such\nrelatively fine-grained judgments of explanatory relevance (that it is\nlinear momentum rather than chalk marks that matters) we need to talk\nabout relationships between properties or magnitudes and it is not\nclear how to express such judgments purely in terms of facts about\ncausal processes and interactions. Both the linear momentum and the\nchalk mark communicated to the cue ball by the cue stick are marks\ntransmitted by the spatio-temporally continuous causal process\nconsisting of the motion of the cue ball.\n\nIronically, as Hitchcock goes on to note, a similar observation may be\nmade about the birth control pills example\n (5)\n originally devised by Salmon to illustrate the failure of the\nDN model to capture the notion of explanatory relevance.\nSpatio-temporally continuous causal processes that transmit marks as\nwell as causal interactions are at work when male Mr. Jones ingests\nbirth control pills\u2014the pills dissolve, components enter his\nbloodstream, are metabolized or processed in some way, and so on.\nSimilarly, spatio-temporally continuous causal processes (albeit\ndifferent processes) are at work when female Ms. Jones takes birth\ncontrol pills. However, the pills are irrelevant to Mr. Jones\u2019s\nnon-pregnancy, and relevant to Ms. Jones\u2019s non-pregnancy. Again,\nit looks as though the relevance or irrelevance of the birth control\npills to Mr. or Ms. Jones\u2019s failure to become pregnant cannot be\ncaptured just by asking whether the processes leading up to these\noutcomes are causal processes in Salmon\u2019s sense. \n\nA more general way of putting the problem revealed by these examples\nis that those features of a process P in virtue of which it\nqualifies as a causal process (ability to transmit mark M) may\nnot be the features of P that are causally or explanatorily\nrelevant to the outcome E that we want to explain (M may\nbe irrelevant to E with some other property R of\nP being the property which is causally relevant to E).\nSo while mark transmission may well be a criterion that correctly\ndistinguishes between causal processes and\npseudo-processes, it does not, as it stands, provide the\nresources for distinguishing those features or\nproperties of a causal process that are causally or\nexplanatorily relevant to an outcome and those features that are\nirrelevant.\n",
