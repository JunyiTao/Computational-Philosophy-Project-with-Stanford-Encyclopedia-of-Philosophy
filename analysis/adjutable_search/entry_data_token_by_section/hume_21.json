    "main_text": "Philosophy of Religion || God\u2019s Natural Attributes\n8.2 God\u2019s Natural Attributes\n\nDemea holds that God is completely unknown and incomprehensible; all\nwe can say is that God is a being without restriction, absolutely\ninfinite and universal. Cleanthes is adamant that the argument from\ndesign establishes all of God\u2019s traditional attributes. Natural\nobjects and human artifacts resemble one another, so by analogy, their\ncauses also resemble each other. God is therefore like a human mind,\nonly very much greater in every respect.\n\nDemea objects that the argument\u2019s conclusion is only probable,\nbut Philo responds that the real problem is that the analogy is so\nweak. He launches a battery of arguments to show just how weak it is.\nThe dissimilarities between human artifacts and the universe are more\nstriking than their similarities. We only experience a tiny part of\nthe universe for a short time; much of what we do experience is\nunknown to us. How can we legitimately infer anything about remote\nparts of the universe, much less the universe as a whole?\n\nPhilo, however, moves quickly away from chipping at the\nargument\u2019s strength to questioning the intelligibility\nof its conclusion. We have no experience of the origin of a\nuniverse. Since causal inference requires a basis in experienced\nconstant conjunction between two kinds of things, how can we\nlegitimately draw any conclusion whatsoever about the origin of the\nuniverse? Does it even require a cause? One or many? Does the cause of\nthe universe itself require a cause? The problem, then, is not just\nthat the analogy is weak; the real problem is that it attempts to take\nus beyond what we can know.\n\nMeanwhile, Demea derides Cleanthes\u2019 anthropomorphism\nwhile remaining smugly satisfied with what Cleanthes disparagingly\ncalls his mysticism. The barbs they throw at each other, and\nthe speeches Philo goads them to make, help create a dilemma that\nPhilo uses them to construct. He directs the dilemma at Cleanthes, but\nit affects both characters, although Demea is slow to realize this. He\nthinks Philo is in league with him in detailing the problems with\nCleanthes\u2019 anthropomorphism.\n\nChallenging Cleanthes to explain what he means by God\u2019s mind,\nPhilo pushes him to admit that he means \u201ca mind like the\nhuman\u201d. Cleanthes, taking the bait, responds, \u201cI know of\nno other\u201d (DCNR 5.4/42). He argues that mystics like Demea are\nno better than atheists, since they make God so remote and\nincomprehensible that he bears no resemblance to human\ncharacteristics. Philo adds that although we regard God as perfect,\nperfection\u2014as we understand it\u2014is relative, not absolute,\nso we can\u2019t conclude that we grasp God\u2019s perfections.\nSince all God\u2019s attributes involve perfection\u2014perfect\nknowledge, perfect power, perfect goodness\u2014we shouldn\u2019t\nthink that any of his attributes resemble or are even\nanalogous to ours. But this means that we don\u2019t know what\nwe\u2019re talking about when we talk about God using the familiar\nterms we apply to human minds.\n\nDemea adds that giving God human characteristics, even if they are\ngreatly magnified, denies him attributes theists have always ascribed\nto him. How can an anthropomorphic God have the unity,\nsimplicity, and immutability of the God of\ntraditional theism?\n\nPhilo continues to detail just how inconvenient\nCleanthes\u2019 anthropomorphism really is. If he accepts the\nargument from design, he must be committed to a God who is finite in\nall respects. But what does it mean to say that God is finitely\nperfect? Once you admit that God is finite, you\u2019ve opened a\ncan of worms, for there are all sorts of equally probable alternatives\nto intelligent design. Why think that the universe is more like a\nhuman artifact than an animal or a vegetable? To illustrate, Philo\nthrows out a number of outlandish alternative hypotheses. For\ninstance, if you were a spider on a planet of spiders, wouldn\u2019t\nyou naturally believe that a giant spider spun an immense web to\ncreate the world?\n\nCleanthes\u2019 design hypothesis is so underdetermined by the\nevidence that the only reasonable approach is to abandon any attempt\nto adjudicate among it and its many alternatives. Total suspension of\njudgment is the only reasonable response. Otherwise, we go beyond the\nbounds of anything to which we can give specific content.\n\nThe dilemma Philo has constructed encapsulates the issue about the\ncontent of the idea of God that is central to the critical\naspect of Hume\u2019s project in the Dialogues. If you\naccept that God\u2019s attributes are infinitely perfect, you are\nusing ordinary terms without their ordinary meaning, so that they do\nnot have any clear meaning. If you deny God\u2019s infinite\nperfection, you can give him understandable attributes, but only\nbecause they are amplified human characteristics. The closer Cleanthes\ncomes to regarding God\u2019s mind as like a human mind, the closer\nhe comes to regarding God\u2019s attributes as being like human\nattributes, and the less Godlike his \u201cGod\u201d is. We can only\ngive the idea of God intelligible content at the perilously high cost\nof denying that he is really God. To do so is to abandon God for some\nkind of superhero.\n\nAt the end of Part 8, which concludes their discussion of God\u2019s\nnatural attributes, Demea still thinks that Philo and he are partners.\nHe remains clueless about Philo\u2019s strategy until the very end of\nPart 11, when he finally realizes that he too is caught in the trap\nPhilo has sprung.\n\nDemea offers an a priori alternative to the design argument\nin Part 9. As noted earlier, it is an abbreviated, watered\u2013down\nversion of Clarke\u2019s cosmological argument. Although Cleanthes\nquickly scotches his lame efforts, Part 9 serves as an interlude\nbetween the previous discussion of God\u2019s natural\nattributes and the consideration of his moral attributes\nin Parts 10 and 11.\n",
