    "main_text": "The meanings of \u2018happiness\u2019 || Clarifying our inquiry\n1.2 Clarifying our inquiry\n\nNow we can sharpen the initial question somewhat: when you ask what\nhappiness is, are you asking what sort of life benefits a\nperson? If so, then your question concerns matters of value, namely\nwhat is good for people\u2014the sort of thing that ethical theorists\nare trained to address. Alternatively, perhaps you simply want to know\nabout the nature of a certain state of mind\u2014happiness in the\npsychological sense. In this case, some sort of psychological inquiry\nwill be needed, either philosophical or scientific. (Laypersons often\nhave neither sort of question in mind, but are really asking about the\nsources of happiness. Thus it might be claimed, say, that\n\u201chappiness is being with good friends.\u201d This is not a view\nabout the nature or definition of happiness, but rather a\ntheory about the sorts of things that tend to make us happy. It leaves\nunanswered, or takes for granted, the question of just what happiness\nis, such that friends are a good source of it.)\n\nIn short, philosophical \u201ctheories of happiness\u201d can be\nabout either of at least two different things: well-being, or a state\nof\n mind.[2]\n Accordingly, there are essentially two bodies of philosophical\nliterature about \u201chappiness\u201d and two sets of debates about\nits nature, though writers often fail to distinguish them. Such\nfailures have generated much confusion, sometimes yielding bogus\ndisagreements that prove to be merely\n verbal.[3]\n For instance, some psychologists identify \u201chappiness\u201d\nwith attitudes of life satisfaction while remaining neutral on\nquestions of value, or whether Bentham, Mill, Aristotle, or any other\nthinker about the good life was correct. Such researchers employ the\nterm in the psychological sense. Yet it is sometimes objected against\nsuch claims that life satisfaction cannot suffice for\n\u201chappiness\u201d because other things, like achievement or\nknowledge, matter for human well-being. The objectors are confused:\ntheir opponents have made no claims about well-being at all, and the\ntwo \u201csides,\u201d as it were, are simply using\n\u2018happiness\u2019 to talk about different things. One might just\nas sensibly object to an economist\u2019s tract on\n\u201cbanks\u201d that it has nothing to say about rivers and\nstreams.\n\nWhich use of \u2018happiness\u2019 corresponds to the true meaning\nof the term in contemporary English? Arguably, both. The well-being\nusage clearly dominates in the historical literature through at least\nthe early modern era, for instance in translations of the ancient\nGreeks\u2019 \u2018eudaimonia\u2019 or the Latin\n\u2018beatitudo\u2019, though this translation has long\nbeen a source of controversy. Jefferson\u2019s famous reference to\n\u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d probably employed the\nwell-being sense. Even later writers such as Mill may have used the\nterm in its well-being sense, though it is often difficult to tell\nsince well-being itself is often taken to consist in mental states\nlike pleasure. In ordinary usage, the abstract noun\n\u2018happiness\u2019 often invites a well-being reading. And the\nlocution \u2018happy life\u2019 may not naturally take a\npsychological interpretation, for the simple reason that lives\naren\u2019t normally regarded as psychological entities.\n\nContrast this with the very different meaning that seems to attach to\ntalk of \u201cbeing happy.\u201d Here it is much less clear\nthat we are talking about a property of a person\u2019s life; it\nseems rather to be a property of the person herself. To be\nhappy, it seems, is just to be in a certain sort of psychological\nstate or condition. Similarly when we say that so-and-so \u201cis\nhappy\u201d (as opposed to saying that he is leading a happy life).\nThis psychological usage, arguably, predominates in the current\nvernacular. Researchers engaged in the self-described \u201cscience\nof happiness\u201d usually do not take themselves to be making value\njudgments when they proclaim individuals in their studies to be happy.\nNor, when asserting that a life satisfaction study shows Utahans to be\nhappier than New Yorkers, are they committing themselves to the\ntendentious claim that Utahans are better off. (If they are,\nthen the psychology journals that are publishing this research may\nneed to revise their peer-review protocols to include ethicists among\ntheir referees.) And the many recent popular books on happiness, as\nwell as innumerable media accounts of research on happiness, nearly\nall appear to take it for granted that they are talking about nothing\nmore than a psychological condition.\n\nHenceforth \u2018happiness\u2019 will be used in the long-term\npsychological sense, unless otherwise specified. Note, however, that a\nnumber of important books and other works on \u201chappiness\u201d\nin recent decades have employed the well-being sense of the term.\nBooks of this sort appear to include Almeder 2000, Annas 1993, 2011,\nBloomfield 2014, Cahn and Vitrano 2015, Kenny and Kenny 2006, McMahon\n2005, McPherson 2020, Noddings 2003, Russell 2013, White 2006, and\nVitrano 2014, though again it is not always clear how a given author\nuses the term.
