But different theories and theorists within NE\nreject\u2014to varying extents, in different ways, and for different\nreasons\u2014different combinations of these features, and so differ\nin how much distance is put between their specific view and\ntraditional\n epistemologies.[2]\n The resulting variety among naturalistic theories is reflected in the\nvarious taxonomies that other commentators have offered. Thus, for\nexample, Alvin Goldman (1994: 301\u2013304) has distinguished between\nmeta-epistemic, substantive and\nmethodological versions of\n NE:[3]\n\nMeta-epistemic NE: The meta-epistemological position\nthat epistemic properties\u2014in particular, those usually counted\nas \u201cnormative\u201d or evaluative (see above)\u2014are, or\nmust be, appropriately related to \u201cnatural\u201d properties.\nThe major forms of such appropriate relations are commonly thought to\nbe reduction and supervenience. (As Goldman notes (1994:\n301\u2013302), and we\u2019ll see below, meta-epistemic NE may not\nas it stands be sufficient to distinguish between certain naturalistic\nand non-naturalistic views; and arguably, the motivation for it is as\nmuch methodological as it is metaphysical\u2014see\n Section 3.2.)\n\nIn terms of\n (a)\u2013(d)\n above, meta-epistemic NE would constitute a denial of the autonomy of\nepistemology\n (b),\n at least as regards its fundamental ontology. If the relevant\nevaluative property cannot be appropriately related to natural ones,\non this view, it is rejected as unreal\u2014yielding\neliminativism or error\ntheory\u2014which would constitute a rejection of\n (c).\n\nSubstantive NE: Some object-level thesis in the vein\nrecommended by meta-epistemic NE\u2014that is, an account of some\nepistemic phenomenon in terms of certain natural (non-normative)\nproperties or relations. Examples here would include accounts of\nknowledge or justification in terms of causation (Goldman 1967),\nreliability (Armstrong 1968, Goldman 1979, Papineau 1993, Kornblith\n2002), natural functions (Graham 2012, Millikan 1984), information\ntheoretic notions (Dretske 1981), or some kind of nomic or counterfactual\ndependence (Nozick 1983). Such accounts tend to be\n\u201cexternalist\u201d in\n character[4]\u2014i.e.,\n they do not require, for a subject to know or be justified in\nbelieving, that s/he be aware of that in virtue of which s/he knows or\nis\n justified.[5]\n\nSubstantive NE too is a rejection of any very strong version of the\nautonomy of epistemology\n (b),\n understood as a claim about its subject matter. Further, some critics\nhave contended that externalism is, as such, ill-equipped to provide\nuseful guidance to epistemic agents, at least of the first-personal\nreason-guiding variety. In this way, it has been thought, substantive\nnaturalistic views might run afoul of\n (c),\n understood as a claim about a specific type of normative guidance or\nimprovement (see, e.g., Kaplan 1994, BonJour 1994). An important\nsub-theme within substantive NE, as Goldman notes, is\n\u201cdescriptive realism as opposed [to] idealization\u201d (1994,\np. 305), not merely for accuracy\u2019s sake, but so as to ensure\nresponsiveness to the principle that \u201cought implies can\u201d\n(ibid.). For some, this is the primary motive for adopting a\nnaturalistic approach:\n\n\nThe main reason that I believe that epistemology would have much to\nlearn from psychology if psychologists knew more about belief\nformation is that I believe that in epistemology as in ethics ought\nimplies can. Epistemic agents cannot and ought not be faulted on the\ngrounds that they did not follow epistemic strategies which are not\ncognitively possible for them. (Grandy 1994: 343; cf., e.g., Cherniak\n1986; Harman 1986, 1999; Bach 1984, 1985; Kornblith 2001)\n\n\nAnother manifestation of the aversion to overly-demanding or otherwise\n\u201cunrealistic\u201d epistemic theory is a tendency to treat\n\n\nthe question \u201cHow is knowledge possible?\u201d\u2026as an\nabbreviation for the question \u201cHow is knowledge possible for\nbeings like us in the world as it is?\u201d (Pacherie 2002: 306; cf.\nPapineau 1993, \u201cIntroduction\u201d, and Kornblith 1994b)\n\n\nThe same \u201crealistic\u201d outlook is evident as well as in\nnaturalists\u2019 well-known and often-criticized disinclination to\nseriously engage with the traditional problem of philosophical\nskepticism (on which, more below).\n\nLast within Goldman\u2019s typology is methodological\nNE, according to which epistemology\n\n\nshould either consist in empirical science, or should at least be\ninformed and beholden to the results of scientific disciplines. (1994:\n305) \n\n\nIf the former, we have what Feldman (2012) and others, following\nKornblith (1994a: 3\u20134), refer to as replacement\nnaturalism. On the latter, weaker reading, on which\nepistemology retains some of its essential (traditional) features and\nmerely \u201cneeds help\u201d from other disciplines (Goldman 1986:\n9), we have what Feldman (2012) calls cooperative\nnaturalism and what Goldman elsewhere (1999a) dubs\nmoderate naturalism (see\n Section 5.1\n below).\n\nIn his own work, Goldman (1999a; 1986; 2005: 403) has emphasized the\nmethodological form or dimension of NE; and it is foremost in the work\nof others as well, including Quine (1969b) and Kornblith (e.g., 2002,\n2007). In terms of the features of TE described above, a commitment to\nmethodological NE would see us rejecting or qualifying both the a priori\ncharacter of epistemology\n (a), understood as a prescriptive claim, and its methodological autonomy (b): on this view, empirical methods and the\nresults obtained thereby have a crucial role to play in epistemological theorizing.\n\nHaving reviewed some general features of TE, and some of the major\nforms and themes of NE, we will next consider some important and\ninfluential recent versions of NE, using the above features and\ncategories to clarify and facilitate discussion. This survey will\ncenter on recent epistemological developments. However, it bears\nemphasizing once again that NE per se is not itself a recent\nphenomenon: as briefly explained in the next (sub)section, various\nthemes within NE are as much a part of our epistemological inheritance\nas are the usual features of TE.\n",
