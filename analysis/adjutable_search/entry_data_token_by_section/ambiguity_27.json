Syntactic\northodoxy holds that either \u2018his\u2019 is co-indexed with John\nor it bears a different referential index. Various theories of\nanaphora, however, have claimed that we can dispense with the\nfundamental ambiguity between free and bound anaphora and unify the\ntreatment of the two. Dynamic Semantics aspires to offer just such a\nunified account, taking all anaphora to always refer to discourse\nreferents, or functions from information states to information states.\nThis provides a unified treatment of the function of anaphora in\nnatural language and dispenses with the need to think of anaphoric\ninterpretation as ambiguous as opposed to merely context-sensitive.\n(See Heim 1982, 1983, and Kamp 1981).\n",
