    "main_text": "Significant Interactions Between Modalities || Obligations and Time\n4.7 Obligations and Time\n\nAs the reader might guess, adding a temporal dimension is typically a\ngood idea, as in most cases it enriches the initial system by allowing\nus to talk about how the concept changes. Besides epistemic\nsettings, others that benefit from this are systems of\n deontic logic,\n which study the properties of concepts as permissions (e.g.,\n\u201c\\(\\varphi\\) is allowed\u201d) and obligations (e.g.,\n\u201c\\(\\varphi\\) is required\u201d). Such systems are extremely\nuseful, as they involve topics such as law, social and business\norganizations, and even security systems.\n\nOne of the interesting concepts that arise when time and obligations\ninteract with each other is the notion of deontic deadlines:\nobligations that need to be fulfilled only once, at a time of\none\u2019s choosing, as long as it is before certain condition become\ntrue. Indeed, \n\n\n[\u2026] deontic deadlines are interactions between two dimensions:\na deontic (normative) dimension and a temporal dimension. So, to study\n[them], it makes sense to take a [\u2026] temporal logic [\u2026]\nand a standard deontic logic [\u2026], and combine the two in one\nsystem. (Broersen, Dignum, Dignum, & Meyer 2004: 43) \n\n\nSuch formal systems help to provide a proper understanding of what a\ndeadline is: as the aforementioned reference asks, \n\n\nis a deadline (1) an obligation at a certain point in time to achieve\nsomething before another point in time, or (2) is a deadline simply an\nobligation that persists in time until a deadline is reached, or (3)\nis it both? \n\n\nThen, the formal setting also allows the possibility to make further\nfiner distinctions, as the one between an obligation to always satisfy\na given \\(\\varphi\\) (in symbols, and with O a modality for\nobligation, \\(OG\\varphi)\\) and an obligation for \\(\\varphi\\) that\nshould be always fulfilled \\((GO\\varphi)\\). Further and deeper\ndiscussions on deontic deadlines can be found in Broersen et al.\n(2004); Broersen (2006); Brunel, Bodeveix, & Filali (2006);\nDemolombe, Bretier, & Louis (2006); Governatori, Hulstijn,\nRiveret, & Rotolo (2007); and Demolombe (2014), among others.\n",
