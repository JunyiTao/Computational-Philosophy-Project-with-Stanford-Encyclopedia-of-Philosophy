    "main_text": "The Second Quarter of the Fourteenth Century || The Modified Heytesbury Solution\n3.5 The Modified Heytesbury Solution\n\nMany later authors felt that Heytesbury had simply sidestepped the\nreal theoretical issue, and went on to stipulate what Heytesbury would\nnot: an insoluble\u2019s \u201cadditional\u201d signification. They\nheld that, in circumstances that make it insoluble, a proposition not\nonly signifies as it normally does; it also signifies that it is\ntrue. This \u201cadjustment\u201d to Heytesbury\u2019s theory\nhas the effect of combining it with the tradition stemming from\n Bradwardine.[29]\n It proved to be an appealing combination. We might call this the\nmodified Heytesbury solution. \n\nThat John of Holland subscribes to the modified view is not\nimmediately obvious, but clear enough when his text is examined\ncarefully. In response to a counter-argument, where A is\n\u2018Socrates says a falsehood\u2019, he writes (John of Holland\n1985, p.130):\n\nI deny the first inference, namely \u2018A is a falsehood, and\nSocrates says A, therefore Socrates says a falsehood\u2019, because\nit is a fallacy secundum quid et simpliciter. For the\nconclusion signifies many things conjunctively, namely that Socrates\nsays a falsehood and something else (according to some people,\nviz that \u2018Socrates says a falsehood\u2019 is true).\n That parenthetical clause contains the modified\nHeytesbury solution. At this point, John has mentioned it but\nhasn\u2019t yet committed himself to it. But in his response to the\nfourth counter-argument, he writes:\n\n\nI reply that \u2018Socrates does not say a falsehood\u2019 is not\nthe contradictory of the insoluble, because the insoluble is not a\nsingular proposition. Hence it is not necessary that this proposition\ncontradict it. But if one asks, what then is the contradictory of this\ninsoluble, I say that it is \u2018Not-(Socrates says a\nfalsehood)\u2019 signifying disjunctively that either Socrates does\nnot say a falsehood or that \u2018Socrates says a falsehood\u2019 is\nnot true. Then this disjunction is true if one of its parts is,\nnamely: \u2018Socrates says a falsehood\u2019 is not true. And the\nreason is that from the fact that the insoluble signifies\nconjunctively that Socrates says a falsehood and that \u2018Socrates\nsays a falsehood\u2019 is true (at least as many people say), it is\nnecessary that its contradictory is a proposition in which the\nnegation is preposed to the whole.\n That strongly suggests that John of Holland accepts the\nmodified view, and stands significantly in contrast to\nHeytesbury\u2019s view, which refuses to specify what the additional\nmeaning is. But none of those who hold the modified view seems to\noffer any argument, as Bradwardine had done, to show that this\nadditional signification is that the proposition itself is\n true.[20]\n",
