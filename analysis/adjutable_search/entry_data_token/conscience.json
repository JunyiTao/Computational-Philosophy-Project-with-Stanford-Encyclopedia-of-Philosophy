Different philosophical, religious and common sense\napproaches to conscience have emphasized different aspects of this\nbroad characterization. The resulting more specific understandings of\nconscience will be presented in the sections below. On any of these\naccounts, conscience is defined by its inward looking and subjective\ncharacter, in the following sense: conscience is always knowledge of\nourselves, or awareness of moral principles we have committed to, or\nassessment of ourselves, or motivation to act that comes from within\nus (as opposed to external impositions). This inward looking and\nsubjective character of conscience is also reflected in the\netymological relation between the notion of \u201cconscience\u201d\nand that of consciousness. Only after the 17th\nCentury did \u201cconsciousness\u201d start to be used with a\ndistinct meaning referring to the psychological and phenomenal\ndimension of the mind, rather than to its moral dimension (for an\naccount of the terminological shift, see Jorgensen 2014).\n\nThe term \u201cconscience\u201d translates the Latin\n\u201cconscientia\u201d, which refers to sharing\n\u201cknowledge\u201d (scientia) \u201cwith\u201d\n(con-), and which in turns translates the equivalent Greek\nterm suneidenai (see Pierce 1955 and Sorabji 2014 for an\netymological analysis of the term). The literal meaning of the term\ndoes not specify the type of knowledge involved and whom that\nknowledge is shared with. However, the concept has traditionally been\nused to refer to moral knowledge (we talk indifferently of\nconscience and moral conscience) that is shared with oneself.\nThis reference to the self does not rule out that the source of the\nmorality in question be external to the self. For example, it might be\nGod, as in the Christian tradition, or the influence of one\u2019s\nculture or of one\u2019s upbringing, as in the Freudian theory of the\nSuper-Ego. Reference to the self indicates that, from a psychological\npoint of view, conscience involves introspection, awareness of\none\u2019s behavior, and self-assessment. As we shall see, although\nthese aspects often overlap, they are psychologically and conceptually\ndistinct functions.\n\n\u201cSharing moral knowledge with oneself\u201d might mean and\nimply different things. As for the object of knowledge, for example,\nit might refer to knowledge of one\u2019s own conduct in view of an\nassessment of it against a certain moral standard, or it might refer\nto knowledge of moral standards or principles themselves. As for the\n\u201cself\u201d with whom knowledge is shared, it might mean\nsharing knowledge with a part of the self, as if we were split into\ntwo persons (Sorabji 2014: 12), but it might also mean sharing\nknowledge with an imaginary witness, such as an ideal observer (for\ninstance a god, an imagined moral model, an impartial spectator).\nUnfortunately, debates in which appeals to conscience are often\nmade\u2014for example the debate about conscientious objection in\nhealth care\u2014are often characterized by a lack of clarity as to\nwhat it exactly is that we are talking about when we talk about\nconscience, and therefore about what exactly people are claiming when\nthey put forward a \u201cconscientious objection\u201d to, for\nexample, abortion. In what sense does abortion violate the conscience\nof a committed Catholic doctor? And is conscience amenable to reason\nand public discussion, or are appeals to conscience ultimately based\non intuitions and private morality? In what sense is a conscientious\nchoice different from a mere moral preference? The notion of\nconscience is in need of conceptual clarification.\n\nThis entry will expound the main features of the notion of conscience\nas it is used in philosophical discussion, religious teaching and in\ncommon language alike. The perspective adopted here will theoretical,\nrather than historical. The entry focuses on the Western tradition and\nsome examples are drawn from Christian source. The entry is structured\naround four possible, but not mutually exclusive, ways of\nconceptualizing conscience. These will be preceded by an introductory\nsection outlining the pluralistic, morally neutral and subjective\nnature of the concept of conscience. The four main aspects of\nconscience that will be described are the following. Section 2\ndiscusses conscience as a faculty for self-knowledge and\nself-assessment. Section 3 presents the epistemic aspect of conscience\nthat allows the formation of moral beliefs, distinguishing the\ndifferent possible sources of moral principles that inform such\nbeliefs. In section 4, conscience will be described as a motivational\nforce or as the source of our sense of duty, which already presupposes\na body of moral knowledge or of moral beliefs. Finally, section 5 will\nfocus on conscience understood as the body of personal core and\nself-identifying moral beliefs which is often taken to be the basis of\nmoral integrity (Fuss 1964; Wicclair 2011) and of our sense of\npersonal identity (Childress 1979). As discussed in section 6, this\nlast approach to conscience is often used with a political function to\nadvocate freedom of thought and action in liberal democratic\nsocieties, for example, as explained in subsection 6.1, through\nconscientious objection to practices that one would otherwise be\nprofessionally or legally expected to perform.\n", "toc": [{"#ConsPlurNeutSubj": "1.

Conscience as pluralistic, neutral and subjective\n\nThe concept of conscience does not bear any connection with any\nparticular substantial moral view (Broad 1940). The voice of\nconscience might suggest different principles and different behaviors\nto different people. In other words, there is no psychological or\nconceptual relation between conscience and any particular moral\nbelief. However, as will be explained below, in the Catholic tradition\nthe idea of an erroneous conscience is sometimes used to refer to\nconscience that fails to recognize the true moral laws which it is\nnaturally predisposed to \u201cwitness\u201d within our heart. As\nfor secular accounts of conscience, the independence of the notion of\nconscience from any substantial moral content can be understood in\nthree senses.\n\nFirst, conscience is a pluralistic notion. To say that a\nperson acted with conscience or that something violates\nsomeone\u2019s conscience does not entail anything about what this\nact consists of or what this person\u2019s moral values are (although\nit might tell us that conscience is itself a value this person holds\ndear). To use a metaphor, conscience is like an empty box that can be\nfilled with any type of moral content. As put by Strohm, \n\n\nconscience has what might be called an \u201cidentity\nproblem\u201d\u2014that it possesses no fixed or inherited content\nof its own, and that it can be hailed and mobilized in defence of one\nposition or equally in defence of its rival. (Strohm 2011: 120) \n\n\nFor example, while some health practitioners raise\n\u201cconscientious\u201d objection to abortion and refuse to\nprovide the service, someone\u2019s conscience might demand the exact\nopposite, i.e., to perform abortions in order to respect what is\nconscientiously believed to be a woman\u2019s right (Joffe 1995).\n\nSecond, conscience is typically a morally neutral concept.\nAppealing to conscience does not usually add anything to the moral\njustification of any particular conduct or principle. Unless one is\ncommitted to the relativistic idea that your belief (or your\nconscience) about x being right or wrong is what makes it right\nor wrong for you to do x (Foot 1979), something is not made\nmorally better or worse, acceptable or unacceptable, simply by being a\nmatter of conscience. For example, the morality of abortion has\nnothing to do with abortion being conscientiously opposed by\nsome health practitioners or conscientiously supported by\nothers. This neutrality does not exclude, however, that an appeal to\nconscience can represent itself a reason for respecting\nsomeone\u2019s moral views, for example a reason for granting someone\na right to object to carrying out certain activities. While appeals to\nconscience do not typically provide any moral reason in defense of a\ncertain moral stance (unless one is a relativist), they might ground\npolitical reasons for respecting individuals\u2019 moral beliefs,\nsuch as for example tolerance or pluralism.\n\nFinally, conscience only concerns the subjective dimension of\nmorality. Even assuming that there are ethical values that, in some\nsense, can be considered objective, conscience only refers to what\nindividuals believe, independently of any external, objective\nproof or justification. And when people state what they subjectively\nand conscientiously believe, they acknowledge that other people might\n(and probably will) subjectively and conscientiously hold different\nmoral views. Thus, when I say that abortion violates my conscience, I\nam not saying (although I might be thinking) that abortion is morally\nwrong by some objective standard, and I\u2019m not necessarily trying\nto convince others that abortion is wrong by some objective standard.\nI am simply stating what I deeply believe and what I want others to\nrespect as my conscientious belief, regardless of how good or bad the\nmoral reasons I can provide to defend my claims are or appear to be to\nothers (McGuire 1963: 259). In fact, when health practitioners claim\nconscientious objection to some medical procedures, they are usually\nnot interested in preventing other doctors who hold different moral\nbeliefs from performing the procedure. They are usually only\ninterested in, so to speak, keeping their hands clean according to\ntheir subjective moral standard.\n\nThese three aspects related to the independence of conscience from\nparticular substantial moral views explain why appeals to conscience\nto justify one\u2019s behavior are usually made with the expectation\nthat no further reason for the behavior in question be required. As\nput by Childress, when an agent appeals to her conscience,\n\n\n[u]sually the agent has given up the attempt to convince others of the\nobjective rightness of his act and is content to assert its subjective\nrightness. (Childress 1979: 329)\n\n2. Conscience as self-knowledge and self-assessment\n\nWhen we talk about conscience, we often refer to reflection about\nourselves as moral persons and about our moral conduct. Through\nconscience we examine ourselves, as if we were our own inner judge.\nThe image of an individual split into two persons, one who acts and\nthe other who observes the former\u2019s conduct, reflects the\noriginal conception of \u201cconscience\u201d in the Greek world, at\nleast from the 5th century BCE (Sorabji 2014: 12). But such\nself- knowledge may also be thought of as shared with others\ninside of us, such as God(s) or other imaginary witnesses (for\nexample an admired philosopher according to Epicurus (Sorabji 2014:\n24), or an impartial spectator according to Adam Smith (1759)). The\ngod(s) in question might be the god(s) of a particular religion, such\nas the God of Christianity, or a postulate of the practical reason,\nsuch as in Kant, according to whom reason, in order to be\n\u201cpractical\u201d in the sense of informing moral conduct, needs\nthe idea of a higher authority who sanctions individuals for their\nactions (Kant 1797).\n\nThe role of conscience in this sense is not that of merely gaining\nknowledge about our behavior or character. The knowledge in question\nis typically (though, as explained below, not always) the ground for a\nmoral assessment by conscience. When observing one\u2019s behavior,\nconscience is more like a judge (or sometimes it is identified with\nthe judgment itself) than like a disinterested observer. Thus, for\ninstance, the impartial spectator with which Adam Smith identified\nconscience, inspired by the Stoic\u2019s notion of conscience as an\nimagined admired philosopher judging one\u2019s conduct, is not a\nmorally and emotionally neutral observer, but generates a sentiment of\napproval or disapproval of oneself (Smith 1759 and discussion in\nRaphael 2007: 34). Even in the Catholic view, where the main\ncharacterization of conscience is that of a witness of God\u2019s law\nin our hearts (as described in\n section 3),\n conscience is also presented as \u201ca moral judgment about man and\nhis actions, a judgment either of acquittal or condemnation\u201d\n(John Paul II 1993: 59). Analogously, in the Kantian view, conscience\nis conceived of as an inner court (Wood 2008: 184): it is moral\nself-awareness that allows to apply the moral law suggested by\npractical reason to our moral conduct, and to judge whether we have\ncomplied with the moral law. As Kant defines it in the Metaphysics\nof Morals, conscience is \n\n\npractical reason holding the human being\u2019s duty before him for\nhis acquittal or condemnation in every case that comes under a law\n(Kant 1797 [1991]: 160) \n\n\nand \n\n\nconsciousness of an internal court in man. (Kant 1797 [1991]: 189)\n\n\nThis understanding of conscience as an inner court is well illustrated\nby the story of Huckleberry Finn in Mark Twain\u2019s famous novel\n(Twain 1884; Bennett 1974). In a well-known episode of the novel, Huck\nfeels guilty and blameworthy for having helped his slave friend Jim to\nescape from his owner Miss Watson. Blame does not come from some\nexternal moral authority, but it is a verdict issued by conscience\naccording to its moral laws. The bites of conscience in Huck\u2019s\ncase were caused by a tension between his feelings supporting what he\ndid and the principles he had inherited from his social environment.\nAt the time when the novel is set, slave-owning was considered a\nnatural type of possession and helping slaves run away meant depriving\nsomeone of her private property. This was the \u201claw\u201d\n(metaphorically speaking) against which Huck\u2019s conscience\nassessed his behavior.\n\nThis story illustrates another interesting feature of conscience as a\nfaculty for self-assessment, i.e., the asymmetry between our\nconfidence in the validity of the moral standards provided by our own\nconscience and our confidence in the validity of the standards\nprovided other people\u2019s conscience. Huck thinks that what he did\nwas wrong and that it rendered him blameworthy in spite of\nhis feelings, because he thinks that his own conscience provides a\ncorrect moral standard, i.e., a standard that he endorses even if some\nof his feelings or beliefs indicate otherwise. This seems to reflect\nour common way of relating to our own conscience: we try to adjust our\nfeelings and judgments to our conscience\u2019s standard, rather than\nvice versa. However, the same does not hold when we talk of\nother people\u2019s conscience, which is usually taken to indicate\ntheir subjective moral standard and does not imply that we are\nendorsing it. This asymmetry suggests that there is no conceptual\nrelation between the notion of conscience per se and the\nnotion of an objective or correct moral standard; rather, it stresses\nonce more the fact that conscience has merely to do with one\u2019s\nprivate morality and one\u2019s commitment to her own morality.\n\nConsistently with this understanding of conscience as self-knowledge\nand self-assessment, it has been suggested by some that\npsychopaths\u2014i.e., pathological subjects who display antisocial\nbehavior and systematically act without regard to what they consider\nto be right or wrong\u2014can be said to lack conscience (Hare 1999).\nFor instance, according to Vujo\u0161evi\u0107 (2015), in\npsychopaths the link between moral knowledge or beliefs and\nself-directed feelings of condemnation (e.g., guilt) is broken:\npsychopaths cannot feel the remorse that normal functioning agents\nfeel when they perceive the discrepancy between their moral beliefs\nand their behavior, and as a consequence psychopaths do not consider\nthemselves accountable for their actions (Gudjonsson and Roberts 1983;\nAharoni et al. 2012), although their moral beliefs are often\n\u201cnormal\u201d (Schaich and Sinnott-Armstrong 2013)\n\nAs mentioned above in this section, when expressing itself through\nself-evaluative feelings, conscience might be conceived of as either\nconstituted by such feelings (Fuss 1964) or as\noccasioning them (Broad 1940).\n\nIn the former sense (conscience as constituted by\nself-evaluative feelings), the feeling is an essential part of\nconscience. Conscience in this case is better conceived not as a judge\nwho issues sentences, but as a feeling with cognitive\ncontent\u2014where the cognitive content concerns the adherence of\none\u2019s behavior to a certain moral standard; in such cases, the\nnegative feeling informs me that what I am doing or am contemplating\ndoing is wrong (according to my own moral parameters). In the latter\nsense (conscience as occasioning self-evaluative feelings),\nthe inner judge, when in tension with one\u2019s conduct, generates\nnegative self-directed feelings (Mill 1861: ch 3). For instance, in\nFreud the \u201cSuper-Ego\u201d\u2014the part of our personality\nthat attends to prohibitions, inhibitions and moral\nconstraints\u2014takes \u201cthe form of conscience\u201d to\nexercise its control over one\u2019s impulses and instincts by\nproducing negative evaluative feelings towards the individual, such as\naggressiveness towards the Ego and guilt (Freud 1929 [2000]: 30). As\nwe shall see below in\n section 4,\n these self-directed negative feelings play an essential role in\nfulfilling the motivational function of conscience.\n\nAs the characterization of conscience as self-assessment here\npresented suggests, conscience has most often been associated with\nnegative feelings (Arendt 1971), such as shame, guilt, fear,\ncontrition. While these feelings are typical of the Christian\nunderstanding of conscience, they need not be tied to a religious\nview: for most of us, even in our common language, conscience is\nsomething that yields negative feelings more often than not\u2014for\nexample we often talk of the \u201cbites of conscience\u201d or of\nconscience as causing us \u201cremorse\u201d (which derives from the\nLatin \u201cremordere\u201d, i.e., \u201cto bite\nagain\u201d). However, a joyful conscience that praises and takes\npride of one\u2019s own moral merit can be conceived as well.\nExamples of joyful conscience can be found for instance in Cicero and\nsome Latin Stoics, most prominently Seneca (Sorabji 2014:\n25\u201330). Also in the Protestant tradition started by Luther we\nfind the idea of a joyful conscience, where joy springs not from pride\nor self-praise, but from awareness of God\u2019s future remission of\nsins (Luther 1535; Calvin 1536).\n\nThe contrast between the Protestant joyful conscience and the Catholic\nconscience burdened by negative feelings of guilt and fear was\nemphasized by Luther when he denounced the \u201cterrorization of\nconscience\u201d by the Roman Catholic Church. According to Luther,\nwith this terrorization the Roman Catholic Church aimed to reinforce\nits authority and control over people\u2019 conscience. In fact,\nconscience in the Catholic tradition can only be relieved from its\nburden of negative feelings through the confession of one\u2019s sins\nto a priest and the penitence decided by that priest.\n3. The epistemic function of conscience\n\nAlong with the previous, non-epistemic conception of conscience, we\ncan also understand conscience as having an epistemic function. In\nthis sense, conscience brings us some form of moral knowledge or moral\nbeliefs\u2014either in an absolute sense, e.g., knowledge of divine\nlaws, or in a relative sense, e.g., knowledge of social norms in\none\u2019s culture.\n\nThe epistemic role of conscience does not necessarily coincide with\nthe role of epistemic faculties or functions such as reason,\nintuitions, or senses. In particular, that conscience\n\u201cbrings\u201d us moral knowledge or beliefs does not\nnecessarily mean that it gives us direct access to the source\nof this knowledge or of these beliefs, as might be the case with\nreason, intuitions, or senses.\n\nThe knowledge we get from conscience, understood as possessing an\nepistemic function, is often conceived as mediated knowledge. This is\nnot surprising, since, as we have seen, conscience is mostly\nunderstood as inward looking, which presupposes that the knowledge to\nwhich it gives us access is already within us and that we\nacquired it through some other process not involving conscience. In\nfact, on many accounts, conscience does not generate its own moral\nprinciples. For example, the moral contents we discover within us can\nbe acquired through divine intervention, as is the case with the laws\nof nature which, according to Christians, God infuses in our heart. As\nwe are going to see in\n subsection 3.1\n here below, the understanding of conscience as having an epistemic\nfunction and as the recipient of mediated knowledge is not exclusive\nto religious views.\n\nOn other accounts of conscience, however, conscience does give us\ndirect access to moral knowledge, for example as an intuition\nabout what is good and what is bad.\n\nLet us examine the two accounts of the epistemic role of conscience in\nmore detail.\n3.1 Conscience as a faculty for indirect moral knowledge\n\nIn the Christian tradition, starting from Paul, the inward looking\ncharacter of conscience is emphasized by the metaphor of the witness\n(Romans 2: 14\u201315). Conscience does not allow us to acquire the\nknowledge of the moral law directly from an external source (God in\nthis case), but only to witness the presence of God\u2019s laws\nwithin us. Conscience cannot directly contemplate God. The idea of a\nfaculty that gives us indirect, and therefore imperfect knowledge of\nsome external moral authority suits religious traditions very well.\nFor example, the idea that through conscience we discover the true\ndivine laws can also be found in Islam (Geaves 1999: 164).\n\nIt is important to note that also in this case, as in the previous\nunderstanding of conscience as self-awareness and self-assessment,\nconscience can be conceived as fulfilling an introspective function,\ni.e., as being directed towards the self and towards\none\u2019s own mental states. Introspection allows one to gain\nself-knowledge (Schwitzgebel 2014), but since the self which is\nobserved contains the moral law, it is possible to say that the law\nitself, as part of our self, becomes the object of introspection.\nThus, for instance, in his theological writings before his papacy,\nJoseph Ratzinger said that \u201csomething like an original memory of\nthe good and the true (the two are identical) has been implanted in\nus\u201d, and conscience is \n\n\nso to speak an inner sense, a capacity to recall, so that the one whom\nit addresses, if he is not turned in on himself, hears its echo from\nwithin. (Ratzinger 1991: 535) \n\n\nThe Catholic Church also makes reference to \u201cthe voice of the\nLord echoing in the conscience of every individual\u201d (John Paul\nII 1995: par. 24).\n\nOn this account\u2014since conscience is only a witness and\ndoes not have direct epistemic access to the source of knowledge,\ni.e., to God\u2014conscience is considered fallible and actually\noften erroneous (1 Corinthians 4:4; Aquinas 1265\u20131274; Butler\n1726: sermon 3 (3)). In particular, conscience might fail to correctly\ninterpret the divine laws when applying them to real cases. According\nto some 13th Century Catholic theologians, such as Philip\nthe Chancellor, Albert the Great and, most notably, Thomas Aquinas,\nconscience is the act of applying universal principles (i.e., divine\nlaws) to real situations, i.e., it is the conclusion of the practical\nsyllogism whose first premise is a universal principle provided by a\nseparate faculty called \u201csynderesis\u201d (Aquinas, Summa\nTheologiae, 1 q79; Langston 2000 and 2015; Sorabji 2014:\n62\u201366): as such, conscience can be erroneous in deriving moral\nconclusions from first principles (Aquinas, On Truth, q17,\nart. 2, and discussion in D\u2019Arcy 1961: 100\u2013103).\n\nOn a secular account, the external source of moral knowledge that\ninstills moral principles in us is not God, but one\u2019s own\nculture or upbringing. In this case, the moral knowledge in question\nis typically understood in a relativistic sense: our conscience is the\nfaculty through which the social norms of our culture or the norms of\nour upbringing are evoked and exert their influence on our moral\npsychology. These norms explain our moral feelings and our moral\nchoices, but what conscience tells us in this case is the product of\nsocial and cultural dynamics over which we have little control. As the\ncase of Huckleberry Finn\u2019s conscience demonstrates, hardly can\nconscience so understood be credited any moral authority, since our\neducators or our culture might be highly immoral (for example our\nconscience might end up drawing on racist or discriminatory\nprinciples, such as the ones which supported slavery in Huck\u2019s\nsocial environment). And in fact, unsurprisingly, many are rather\nskeptical or dismissive of the moral authority of conscience, since\nthey see it as mere opinion about moral principles influenced or even\ndetermined by one\u2019s own culture (Montaigne 1580: book 1, ch. 22;\nHobbes 1651: ch. 7). In this sense, conscience is a merely\nrelativistic notion whose content changes according to social,\ncultural, and familial circumstances.\n3.2 Conscience as a faculty for direct moral knowledge\n\nContrary to what Montaigne and Hobbes had claimed, Rousseau argued in\nEmile, or Education that good education can free conscience\nfrom the corrupting influences of societies. Actually, one of the aims\nof education is to render the young autonomous moral thinkers and\nagents by teaching them how to critically examine and, if necessary,\nreplace received norms (Rousseau 1762; see Sorabji 2014, for a\ndiscussion). The idea here is that conscience is what remains of our\ninnate moral sense once we free it from \u201cchildish errors\u201d\nand \u201cprejudices of our upbringing\u201d (Rousseau 1921 [1762]:\n253). As Rousseau presents it,\n\nThere is therefore at the bottom of our hearts an innate principle of\njustice and virtue, by which, in spite of our maxims, we judge our own\nactions or those of others to be good or evil; and it is this\nprinciple that I call conscience. (Rousseau 1921 [1762]: 253)\n\n\nAccording to Rousseau, then, conscience has a natural tendency to\nperceive and follow the right order of nature, and a good teacher\nshould help the young\u2019s conscience to do what it is naturally\npredisposed to do. In Rousseau\u2019s words:\n\nToo often does reason deceive us; we have only too good a right to\ndoubt her; but conscience never deceives us; she is the true guide of\nman; it is to the soul what instinct is to the body; he who obeys his\nconscience is following nature and he need not fear that he will go\nastray\u2026 Let us obey the call of nature; we shall see that her\nyoke is easy and that when we give heed to her voice we find a joy in\nthe answer of a good conscience. (Rousseau 1921 [1762]: 252)\n\n\nThis understanding of conscience as a deeper form of moral knowledge\nbrings us to the second sense in which conscience can be said to have\nan epistemic role. As well as merely witnessing received opinions or\ndivine laws, conscience can also be conceived as a moral sense giving\nus direct access to moral principles. Understood in this way,\nconscience is typically seen as intuitive and influenced by emotions,\nrather than a reason-based faculty. In particular, 18th\nCentury sentimentalist philosophers often (e.g., Shaftesbury (1711)\nand Hume (1738\u20131740)) identified conscience with a moral\n\u201csentiment\u201d or moral \u201csense\u201d. According to\nHume\u2019s psychological theory, for instance, \u201creason is\nwholly inactive and can never be the source of so active a principle\nas conscience, or a sense of morals\u201d (Hume 1738\u20131740: book\n3, part 1, section 1). Also on more recent accounts of conscience and\nof private morality, the dictates of conscience can be understood as\nexpressions of our moral intuitions. According to Thagard and Finn\n(2011), for instance, \u201cconscience is a kind of moral\nintuition\u201d (p. 168) that is \u201cboth cognitive and\nemotional\u201d(p.156).\n\nOnce again, there are reasons to doubt the epistemic and moral\nauthority of conscience so understood. A lot of work in recent moral\npsychology aimed at understanding moral disagreement has suggested\nthat there are seemingly irreconcilable differences in fundamental\nmoral intuitions and emotions among people with different worldviews\n(e.g., Haidt 2012; Greene 2013). These differences in fundamental\nmoral intuitions seem to undermine the epistemic status of conscience\nand, with it, conscience\u2019s moral authority, not least because\nmost of our moral intuitions seem, according to these recent\ndevelopments in moral psychology, not to be amenable to revision in\nlight of new evidence or new good reasons. Reasoning, on any plausible\naccount, should be an important part of morality; however, what our\nconscience tells us may have little to do with reasons and evidence.\nTheoretical work in moral psychology (e.g., Haidt 2012; Graham et al.\n2009; Haidt 2001), supported by evidence from neuroscience (Greene\n2013), suggests that our most fundamental moral beliefs might be based\non intuitions and emotions over which our rational capacities have\nlittle control. If this account is correct, then we have reasons to be\nskeptical about the possibility of affecting, let alone changing,\npeople\u2019s conscientious beliefs through dialogue, public\ndiscussion and reason giving. Psychological research has focused\nparticularly on the differences between liberal and conservative\nthinking. For example, it has been suggested that conservative moral\nand political views are often founded on certain specific emotions,\ne.g., disgust or fears, and specific intuitions, e.g., intuitive\nopposition to perceived violations of purity and to authority\nsubversion, whereas liberal views are often driven by other specific\nemotions, e.g., anger, and intuitions, e.g., intuitive rejection of\nfairness violations or liberty infringements (Haidt 2001 and 2012). If\nconscience simply is the expression of moral intuition, and if\nindividuals have significantly different and irreconcilable moral\nintuitions, then individuals also have significantly different and\ndifficult-to-reconcile conscientious moral consciences.\n4. Conscience as motivation to act morally\n\nConscience can also be conceived as our sense of duty. According to\nthis understanding, conscience motivates us to act according to moral\nprinciples or beliefs we already possess (e.g., D\u2019Arcy 1963;\nChildress 1979; McGuire 1963; Fuss 1964). Conscience so understood\n\u201cestablishes a general sense of moral obligation in the\nindividual\u2019s consciousness\u201d (Fuss 1964: 116). The\nsubjective character of conscience implies that the motivational force\nmust come entirely from within the individual, as opposed to sanctions\nfrom an external authority.\n\nA powerful motivational source is represented by the feelings that\nconscience generates in its self-assessment function. As we said at\nthe beginning, the different understandings of conscience presented\nhere are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Conscience as\nself-assessment and conscience as motivation to act morally constitute\na good example of perspectives on conscience which are not only\nconsistent with one another, but which actually complete one another.\nIn Kant, for example, the theory of conscience can be seen as \u201ca\nmotivation theory set in the context of a reflection theory\u201d\n(Wood 2008: 183): As Wood interprets the Kantian notion of conscience,\n\u201cconscience is a feeling of pleasure or displeasure associated\nwith myself\u201d that arises when I comply or don\u2019t comply\nwith moral principles and that motivates me to act in one sense rather\nthan the other when the feeling accompanies the contemplation of a\ncertain course of action (Wood 2008: 183\u2013184). Conscience for\nKant is therefore not only an inner court, but also the source of our\nsense of duty in that it takes the judgments of the inner court as\nmotivation to act morally (Kant 1797 [1991]: 161).\n\nMore generally, as we have seen in\n section 1,\n conscience\u2019s self-assessment often produces remorse or other\nnegative feelings (guilt, shame, fear, and so on). Our desire or\ntendency to avoid this form of self-punishment can have motivational\nforce towards acting morally. Thus, for instance, according to\nChildress the motive for acting morally that defines conscience is\n\u201cin part, avoidance of a sanction imposed by the self on\nitself\u201d (Childress 1979: 328).\n\nConsistent with this philosophical view are studies in developmental\npsychology suggesting that the emotion of guilt, which is typically\nseen as one of the products of conscience as self-assessment, is\n\u201cthe motivational engine that infuses misdeeds with negative\npersonal valence\u201d (Kochanska and Aksan 2006: 1589).\nTransgression generates anxious feelings in most children, and these\nnegative feelings help children suppress future wrongdoing and\ninternalize the relative moral norms (Dam\u00e1sio 1994, as reported\nin Kochanska and Aksan 2006: 1595).\n\nHowever, at the same time, the negative self-directed feelings must\nthemselves be generated by previous experience of tension between our\naction and a pre-existing sense of duty. Although it might seem that\nwe are stuck in an infinite regress, where sense of duty and negative\nself-directed feelings presuppose one another, this need not be the\ncase. It is possible to conceive of an external or independent source\nof that most fundamental sense of duty that constitutes our\nconscience, such as for example our moral education and upbringing\n(Mill 1861: ch. 3). But the sense of duty that identifies a\nconscientious person can also be conceived as a primitive function, an\ninnate disposition which is not explained by any other more\nfundamental mechanism. In Kant, for instance, \u201cevery human\nbeing, as a moral being, has a conscience within him originally\u201d\n(Kant 1797 [1991]: 160), and conscience is one of the four\n\u201cnatural predispositions of the mind (\u2026) for being\naffected by concepts of duty\u201d, the other three being moral\nfeeling, love for one\u2019s neighbors, and respect for oneself (Kant\n1797 [1991]: 160). \n\nNegative feelings and sense of duty are not always successful in\nprompting agents to do what their moral principles require. But the\n\u201cbites of conscience\u201d, or just the prospect of bites of\nconscience, act as motivational force towards aligning our future\nbehavior to those norms. Of course, positive feelings associated with\nconscience might also have a motivational force. For example, as seen\nabove, Kant associated conscience also with positive feelings about\noneself when the agent recognizes he has acted according to his sense\nof duty. Rousseau, alongside the epistemic account of conscience\npresented above, also provides in Emile a motivational\naccount of conscience based on positive feelings: while reason gives\nus knowledge of the good, it is conscience, through a sentiment of\nlove for the good, which motivates us to behave morally (Rousseau\n1762).\n5. Conscience, self-identifying moral commitments, and moral integrity\n\nThe subjective character of conscience delimits a sphere of personal\nmorality that is an essential part of our sense of personal identity,\nunderstood as our sense of who we are and of what characterizes\nqualitatively our individuality (for instance, our character, our\npsychological traits, our past experience, etc.). My conscience is\nwhat makes me this particular individual in a social and\ncultural context that I want to keep separate from me.\n\nThis private space in which the individual finds her own sense of\nidentity often grounds the political use of the notion of conscience.\nThus, many people claim the right to stick to their\nconscience\u2014particularly by advancing so called\n\u201cconscientious objection\u201d\u2014when social expectations\nor legal obligations would demand otherwise. These political appeals\nto conscience are usually made on the basis of two principles. The\nfirst is the principle of respect for moral integrity, which finds its\njustification in the close relationship between the notions of\nconscience and of moral integrity on one side (Childress 1979), and\nthe sense of personal identity on the other. The second principle\noften invoked in the political uses of \u201cconscience\u201d is the\nprinciple of \u201cfreedom of conscience\u201d. The former will be\ndiscussed in this section, and the latter in the next section.\n\nThe concept of personal identity in the sense in which the notion is\nused here\u2014i.e what defines me as this particular person in a\nqualitative sense\u2014is intimately related to the notions of\nconscience (Wicclair 2011; Childress 1979) and of moral integrity, and\nmore specifically to the \u201cidentity view of integrity\u201d (Cox\net al. 2013; Williams 1973 and 1981). According to this view, for\npeople to have integrity means to remain faithful to\n\u201cidentity-conferring commitments\u201d, i.e.,\n\u201ccommitments that people identify with most deeply, as\nconstituting what they consider their life is fundamentally\nabout\u201d (Cox et al. 2013). This identity-conferring aspect of\none\u2019s morality is exactly what some people call\n\u201cconscience\u201d. According to Childress, for example, \n\n\n[i]n appealing to conscience I indicate that I am trying to preserve a\nsense of myself, my wholeness and integrity, my good conscience, and\nthat I cannot preserve these qualities if I submit to certain\nrequirements of the state or society. (Childress 1979: 327)\n\n\nConscience as self-identifying can be understood in two ways. It can\nbe thought of either as a set of core and self-identifying moral\nbeliefs that are \u201cintegral to an agent\u2019s understanding of\nwho she is (i.e., her self-conception or identity)\u201d (Wicclair\n2011: 4), or as a way of approaching and relating to such moral\nbeliefs, i.e., a \u201ccommitment to uphold one\u2019s deepest and\nself-identifying moral beliefs\u201d (Sulmasy 2008: 138) and \u201ca\nmode of consciousness in which prospective actions are viewed in\nrelation to one\u2019s self and character\u201d (Bluestein 1993:\n294).\n\nConceived in either way, conscience is an essential part of our\nunderstanding of what kind of person we are, and this is taken to be a\nreason for warranting protection of conscience and conscientious\nobjection in different contexts, particularly in the health care\nprofessions (Wicclair 2011: 25\u201326; Bluestein 1993: 295).\n\nWe have seen above that there is a sense in which, according to some,\npsychopaths can be said to lack conscience (Hare 1999): psychopaths\nare not capable of connecting their moral knowledge to their conduct\nthrough the feelings of guilt and disapproval which conscience, on\nsome accounts, produces. Interestingly, according to some\npsychologists, psychopaths are also less likely to base their sense of\npersonal identity on moral traits than normal functioning individuals\n(Glenn et al. 2010). More recent psychological studies have suggested\nthat people tend to link the identity of others not so much to their\nmemories, as traditionally believed, but to their morals: it is the\nloss of one\u2019s moral character and moral beliefs, rather than of\none\u2019s memory, that leads us to say that a certain individual is\nnot the same person anymore (Strohminger and Nichols 2015). These\nfindings provide empirical support to the idea that conscience is\nessential to one\u2019s sense of personal identity and to\nattributions of personal identity\n6. Freedom of conscience\n\nSome people have suggested that appeals to freedom of\nconscience tend to be more vigorously put forward and more effective\nin contexts where political or religious structures lose power or\nmoral authority. Thus, for instance, according to C.A. Pierce:\n\nconscience only came into its own in the Greek world after the\ncollapse of the city-state. The close integration of politics with\nethics, with the former predominant, was no longer possible: there was\nno sufficiently close authority, external to the individual,\neffectively to direct conduct. Consequently, as a pis aller,\nmen fell back on the internal chastisement of the conscience as the\nonly authority. (Pierce 1955: 76)\n\n\nThe same can be said for 17th Century England, with its\ncrisis of religious authority and the frequent appeals to freedom of\nconscience in the philosophical and political literature of that time\n(Childress 1979: 326).\n\nThere are three main arguments that can be used to defend a principle\nof freedom of conscience. Two of them are frequently found in the\n16th and 17th Century philosophical literature:\nthey are the \u201cargument from ineffectiveness or hypocrisy\u201d\nand the \u201cargument from ignorance\u201d (Sorabji 2014: 139). A\nthird argument, which might be called \u201cargument from\nlegitimization\u201d, was put forward by John Stuart Mill. Let us\nexamine them in order.\n\na) The argument from ineffectiveness or hypocrisy is based on\nthe relevance of the distinction between beliefs and acts for the\ndefinition of conscience. According to this argument, it is not\npossible to compel someone to believe or to not believe something,\ni.e., to change one\u2019s conscientious beliefs. All we can do is\ncompel people to act as if they believed something, which\nwould be a hypocritical behavior. Therefore, if some authority aims to\nconvert people or to change people\u2019s moral views, prohibiting\nthe free expression, through actions, of one\u2019s\nconscience would not serve this purpose.\n\nThis line of argument was often put forward by early Christians, most\nnotably Christian apologist Tertullian, to defend their freedom to\npractice their cult in a time where they were persecuted by Roman\ngovernors: their claim was that forcing them to abandon the Christian\ncults would have no effect on their conscience. The same line of\nargument can also be found in Locke\u2019s works on toleration, the\nEssay Concerning Toleration of 1667 and A Letter\nConcerning Toleration of 1689.\n\nHowever, Christians did not seem to believe in the force of this\nargument, and more generally in the principle of freedom of\nconscience, when, later on, they attempted to justify the violent\npersecution of heretics (those who revise their religious dogmas) and\napostates (those who abandon their religion) and their forced\nconversion (Clarke 2014: 118\u2013123). Two main justifications have\nbeen given by Christian theologians for the forced conversion of\nheretics and apostates.\n\nOne can be found, among others, in Aquinas and Calvin, who thought\nthat violent persecution is justified because heretics\u2019 mistaken\nviews would exert great influence on many ordinary people. By\ndeparting from the Christian doctrine, these people would be condemned\nto eternal damnation in the afterlife, and Christians have a duty to\nsave as many people as possible from eternal damnation (Clarke 2014:\n120\u2013121).\n\nA second type of argument in defense of violent persecution is the one\noffered by Augustine (5th Century). He argued that\ncompelling people to follow the true religion\u2014by which he meant\npersecuting heretics\u2014could open their eyes to the truth (Sorabji\n2014: 49\u201350). This thesis implies that sometimes conscience,\neven if we confine it to matters of inward conviction and not to\nbehavior, can be influenced by some external imposition.\n\nThis latter approach based on the idea of bringing the truth to\nconscience by \u201cfreeing\u201d conscience from error is\nconsistent with the Catholic peculiar understanding of the notion of\nfreedom of conscience. Philosophically speaking, \u201cfreedom of\nconscience\u201d is typically understood as an individualistic\nconcept that allows for a plurality of moral and religious views\n(Strohm 2011: 90). For the Catholic Church, however,\nauthentic freedom is inseparable from the notion of truth.\nInspired by the works of the English theologian and cardinal John\nHenry Newman, Joseph Ratzinger writes that in the Catholic view\n\u201ctruth\u201d is the middle term that reconciles authority of\nGod and subjectivity of conscience: the latter, when authentically\nfree, cannot but reveal the truth established by the former (Ratzinger\n1991). Since, as we have seen above, in the Catholic view reason alone\ncan\u2019t create its own values, which are instilled by God into\nhumans\u2019 hearts, \u201chuman freedom finds its authentic and\ncomplete fulfillment precisely in the acceptance of that law\u201d of\nGod (John Paul II 1993: par. 35). So when practical reason is free to\nexercise its \u201cparticipation\u201d (John Paul II 1993: sec. 40)\nin the divine law, then \u201cin the depths of his conscience, man\ndetects a law which he does not impose upon himself, but which holds\nhim to obedience\u201d (Paul VI 1965: par. 16).\n\nIn any case, it is not necessary to dismiss the argument from\nineffectiveness in order to justify imposing norms and practices that\nmight violate individuals\u2019 conscience. Actually, the same\nargument from ineffectiveness can be used to support the imposition of\npolicies that might conflict with individuals\u2019 consciences. On\nthe basis of the idea that conscience is merely a matter of private\nbeliefs, not of action, some authors have argued that compelling\npeople to follow certain rules even against their conscience would not\nconstitute a violation of their freedom of conscience, and is\ntherefore justifiable. This was the line of argument pursued, for\nexample, by Thomas Hobbes (1651: chapter 40), Baruch Spinoza (1670:\nchapter 20) and John Locke (1660), who argued that the State has the\npower to enforce certain practices even when citizens claim that it\nwould violate their conscience, in order to protect social order.\n\nb) The \u201cargument from ignorance\u201d, which might be\nbetter labeled \u201cargument from humility\u201d, is based\non a skeptical approach to the content of conscience. The possibility\nexists that what we conscientiously believe is wrong and that those\nholding conscientious beliefs opposite to ours are right. Therefore,\nthere is a reason for not forcing anyone to believe in something or to\nengage in behaviors that might turn out to be morally wrong. The\nargument from ignorance or humility started to be put forward quite\nfrequently, and most prominently by Pierre Bayle (1686\u20131688),\nafter the Catholic Church lost a significant proportion of its\nreligious and moral authority following the Protestant reform in\n16th and 17th Century\u2014which was defined by\nKeith Thomas (1993) as \u201cthe age of conscience\u201d. It was at\nthat time that we assisted to the \u201csecularization of\nconscience\u201d in the modern era (Strohm 2011), although the\nphenomenon would be better conceived of as a\n\u201cre-secularization\u201d, since conscience was not related to\nthe voice or the authority of God in the Greek world.\n\nThe same argument from ignorance or from humility is also put forward\nby John Locke in his Second Letter Concerning Toleration.\nLocke had to rely on this argument as an alternative strategy to\ndefend freedom of conscience after the Anglican priest Jonas Proast\npointed out that compulsion can actually change personal beliefs (as\nAugustine had argued), and that therefore the argument from\nineffectiveness that Locke had used in his first Letter fails\n(Sorabji 2014: 151).\n\nA version of the argument from ignorance can also be found in\ncontemporary defenses of conscientious objection in an age where\npluralism of worldviews is acknowledged and actually supported. For\nexample, Sulmasy appeals to epistemic humility as \u201ctrue basis of\ntolerance\u201d (Sulmasy 2008: 144) in his arguments in support of a\nright to conscientious objection in health care. \n\nc) Finally, the third argument in defense of freedom of conscience is\nwhat I have called above the \u201cargument from\nlegitimization\u201d. John Stuart Mill (1859) defended freedom\nof conscience by appealing to the idea that allowing the free\nexpression of any opinion, and particularly mistaken opinions, would\nallow truth to emerge more clearly and would provide us with a\njustification for acting upon our own beliefs, once they have been\nassessed against others\u2019 opinions. As put by Mill, \n\n\n[c]omplete liberty of contradicting and disproving our opinion, is the\nvery condition which justifies us in assuming its truth for purposes\nof action; and on no other terms can a being with human faculties have\nany rational assurance of being right. (Mill 1859: ch. 2)\n\n6.1 Freedom of conscience and conscientious objection today\n\nFreedom of conscience is today protected by the United Nations\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, which reads: \u201cEveryone\nhas the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion\u201d\n(art. 18).\n\nAccording to Strohm, this article should not be taken to imply freedom\nto act according to one\u2019s conscience, but it only refers to\n\u201cmatters of inward conviction\u201d (Strohm 2011: 88). If this\ninterpretation is correct, article 18 does not seem to raise any\ninteresting philosophical or practical problem today, as very few\npeople today would deny freedom in matters of inward\nconviction. More problematic is the moral and political debate about\nthe freedom to act, or to refrain from acting,\naccording to one\u2019s conscience, especially where there are\nprofessional roles or legal obligations that would demand otherwise.\nIn fact, appeals to conscience and freedom of conscience are often\ndeployed to claim and justify \u201cconscientious objection\u201d to\ncertain activities that someone would otherwise be required to\nperform.\n\nOne example is conscientious objection to the military service where\nconscription is in place. Although originally conscientious objection\nto war was mainly a religious issue (the Quakers were the most famous\ngroup of conscientious objectors to war), in more recent times the\nobjection to war has been put forward and granted without explicit\nreference to any religious justification (Moskos and Chamber\n1993).\n\nAs most States have now abolished conscription, appeals to freedom of\nconscience and to conscientious objection today can be found mainly in\ndebates in medical ethics with regard to health practitioners who\nconscientiously object to performing medical procedures they morally\noppose, such as abortions (for overviews of the debate in medical\nethics, see Wicclair 2011; Wester 2015).\n\nAccording to those who are against a right to conscientious objection,\nprofessional obligations trump any value conscience might have and any\nprinciple that might justify conscientious objection qua\nconscientious (e.g., Savulescu 2006; Giubilini 2014 and 2017,\nSavulescu and Schuklenk 2017); according to defenders of conscientious\nobjection, professionals\u2019 conscience must be protected to the\nlargest extent possible, i.e., up to the point where respecting\nconscience would significantly jeopardize physical or psychological\nhealth of patients (e.g., Sulmasy 2008; Wicclair 2011), a compromise\nthat, depending on circumstances\u2014for example a too high\npercentage of objecting practitioners which would make it nearly\nimpossible to refer patients to non-objecting doctors\u2014might be\nvery difficult to achieve (Minerva 2015). Between these two stances,\nthere are positions that are neither for nor against conscientious\nobjection in principle, but pose tighter restrictions to those who\nadvance conscientious objection (McLeod 2020), for example the\nrequirement to provide reasons for the objection, and to submit such\nreasons to public scrutiny or experts\u2019 assessment of the\nreasonability of one\u2019s objection (Card 2007, Card 2020), or the\nqualification that objection can only be justified if consistent with\nthe internal values of the profession (Wicclair 2000; Deans 2013).\n\n\nHowever, if it is the validity or the soundness of the reasons\nprovided which is considered relevant for the justification of\nconscientious objection, it seems that the value of conscience and the\nprinciple of freedom of conscience are no longer at stake. What makes\nan objection good or bad, acceptable or unacceptable, has nothing to\ndo with its being conscientious, unless we add a \u201cgenuineness\nrequirement\u201d (e.g., Meyers and Woods 1996) to an assessment of\nthe legitimacy of a conscientious objection, whereby professional need\nto demonstrate that the moral beliefs at stake are deeply and\nsincerity held. The interesting question in this case would be whether\na test can be devised that can reliably track genuine conscientious\nobjections.\n7. Conclusion\n\nThere is no such a thing as the notion of conscience, both in\na philosophical and in a psychological sense. As we have seen, the\nconcept of conscience has been given different interpretations\nthroughout history, sometimes on the basis of underlying systematic\nphilosophical theories of the mind and of morality, and sometimes\nserving religious or political purposes.\n\nThis lack of uniformity is not only a problem for historians and\ntheoretical philosophers. Because it cannot be immediately clear what\nwe are talking about when we talk of conscience, of freedom of\nconscience, or of conscientious objection, it is important that\nclarity is made every time conscience is appealed to in different\nbranches of applied philosophy (particularly medical ethics) and in\npublic debates alike.\n\nThis entry has presented a conceptual map, rather than a historical\naccount, of conscience, which can provide some guidance for those\nengaged in this clarificatory task. One of the benefits of clarifying\nconcepts, and clarifying them in the different circumstances in which\nthey are used, is their subsequent demystification.\n\nConscience needs to be demystified, since it is one of those concepts\nthat tend to elicit reverence rather than questions or an interest in\nfurther inquiry. As seen above, appeals to conscience often replace\nreason giving and are made with the expectation that no further reason\nfor one\u2019s decisions and positions is requested. This attitude is\nalso displayed in many legislative approaches dealing with the notion\nof conscience; in particular, legislations about conscientious\nobjection in health care typically grant doctors a right to object to\nperforming certain professional activities (e.g., conscientious\nobjection to abortion) without requiring them to provide reasons for\ntheir objection, let alone submitting reasons to some form of\nassessment.\n\nThis entry has distinguished four main understandings of conscience,\ndrawing on the philosophical tradition of the concept. Whether the\nconcept is to be understood as a faculty for self-knowledge and\nself-assessment, or as having an epistemic function in the sphere of\nmorality, or as a motivational force, or again as a set of\nself-identifying moral beliefs, or a combination of any of these\ncharacterizations, it is important to have clear in mind what exactly\nwe are talking about when we talk of conscience and of freedom of\nconscience in each circumstance.\n\nFar from being a conversation-stopper, conscience can only find its\nproper place in philosophical and in public discussion if its\nphilosophical and psychological aspects are teased out, defined and\nassessed. Appeals to conscience can only be part of philosophical,\npolitical, and legal discussion if they are seen as the start, not the\nend of discussions.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aharoni, E., W.
