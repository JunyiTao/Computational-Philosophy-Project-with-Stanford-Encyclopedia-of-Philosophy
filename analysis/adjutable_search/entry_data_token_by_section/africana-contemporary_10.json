Reading the contemporary\u2014structure\n\nContemporary Africana philosophy builds on the periods of emergence,\nestablishment, and consolidation in four broad ways. Some thinkers\nwork to fortify and expand the field\u2019s store of germinal texts\nand figures. Others continue to improvise on the defining traits of\nthe mainstream schools and movements. Still others complicate and\nbroaden the map of regional preoccupations. And interventions of all\nthree types push new themes and debates, or new takes on older themes\nand debates, toward the center of the field. The first three will be\nthe subject of this section, while the fourth will be the subject of\nSection 7.\n",
