    "main_text": "Situations, minimality, and donkey sentences\n6. Situations, minimality, and donkey sentences\n\nOne of the most frequent uses of situation-based frameworks is in the\nanalysis of \u201cdonkey\u201d pronouns, that is, anaphoric pronouns\nthat are interpreted as definite descriptions (see descriptive\ntheories of anaphora under the entry\n descriptions\n and the entry\n anaphora).\n\n(25)\n\n\na.\nWhenever a donkey appeared, it was greeted enthusiastically.\nb.\nWhenever a donkey appeared, the donkey was greeted\nenthusiastically.\n \n\n\nThe pronoun it in 25(a) is an instance of a descriptive\npronoun that is interpreted like the corresponding definite\ndescription in 25(b). Suppose I use 25(a) or (b) to talk about a\nparticular situation, call it \u201cDonkey Parade\u201d. The\nsituations that whenever quantifies over are then all part of\nDonkey Parade. They are precisely those subsituations of Donkey Parade\nthat are minimal situations in which a donkey appeared. Those must\nthen be situations with a single donkey in them. The claim is that all\nthose situations are part of situations where the donkey was greeted\nenthusiastically. More formally, my claim about Donkey Parade is\n(26):\n\n(26)\n\u03bbs \u2200s\u2032 [ [s\u2032\n\u2264p s & s\u2032 \u2208\nMin(\u03bbs \u2203x\n[donkey(x)(s) &\nappeared(x)(s)])] \u2192 \u2203s\u2033[\ns\u2032 \u2264p s\u2033 &\ngreeted-enthusiastically (\u03b9x\ndonkey(x)(s\u2032))(s\u2033)] ]\n\n\n(26) reflects the standard analysis of adverbs of quantification and\ndescriptive pronouns in a possibilistic situation semantics (Berman\n1987; Heim 1990; Portner 1992; von Fintel 1994, 2004b; Elbourne 2002,\n2005, 2013, 2016). All resource situations that are introduced in (26)\nare directly or indirectly related to the topic situation via the part\nrelation \u2264p. The topic situation is the\nultimate anchor for all resource situations. It indirectly restricts\nthe donkeys being talked about to those that are present in Donkey\nParade. The antecedent of the conditional introduces a further\nrestriction: we are considering only those subsituations of Donkey\nParade that are minimal situations in which a donkey appeared. Those\nsituations have just one donkey in them, and they can thus be used as\nresource situations for the definite description the donkey\nor a corresponding descriptive pronoun.\n\nThe crucial feature of any analysis of donkey sentences within a\nsituation semantics is that quantification is over minimal situations\nsatisfying conditions imposed by the antecedent of the conditional.\nThe minimality condition is crucial for the analysis of descriptive\npronouns. Without it, we wouldn\u2019t be able to analyze those\npronouns as definite descriptions:\n\n(27)\nWhenever a man saw a donkey, the man greeted the donkey.\n\n\nWe have to make sure that the situations or events quantified over\nhave just one man and just one donkey in them, because definite\ndescriptions have to be unique with respect to their resource\nsituations. The minimality condition is a source of potential trouble,\nhowever (Reinhart 1986, Dekker 2004; von Fintel 2004a,b). When the\nantecedent of a conditional contains a mass noun, negative\nquantifiers, or certain kinds of modified quantifier phrases,\nquantification over minimal situations or events seems to yield\nunwelcome results or isn\u2019t possible at all:\n\n(28)\n\n\na.\nWhen snow falls around here, it takes ten volunteers to remove\nit.\nb.\nWhen a cat eats more than one can of Super Supper in a day, it\ngets sick.\nc.\nWhenever there are between 20 and 2000 guests at a wedding, a\nsingle waiter can serve them.\nd.\nWhenever nobody showed up, we canceled the class.\n \n\n\n28(a) raises the question whether there ever are minimal situations or\nevents in which snow falls. But even if there are, we do not quantify\nover them in this case. We also do not seem to rely on discrete scales\nfor measuring portions of Super Supper. But even if we did, this would\nnot help with 28(b). This sentence does not necessarily quantify over\nsituations in which a cat eats just a little more than a can of Super\nSupper. Minimality also doesn\u2019t seem to play a role for 28(c).\nIf 28(c) quantified over minimal situations that have between 20 and\n2000 wedding guests, it would quantify over situations or events with\nexactly 20 wedding guests, and might very well be true. 28(d) is even\nmore dramatic. What would a minimal situation or event look like in\nwhich nobody showed up? If any event- or situation-based analysis of\ndonkey sentences is to succeed, then, it must keep the events or\nsituations that are quantified over small enough to contain just one\nman and one donkey in cases like (27), but it has to accomplish this\nwithout minimizing the amount of snow, Super Supper, or wedding guests\nin cases like 28(a) to (c). And it should not mess with negative\nconstructions at all. When we are quantifying over situations in\ndonkey sentences, then, we need to relate possibly very complex\nsentences to exemplifying situations in a way that is responsive to\nthe different behavior of different kinds of antecedents illustrated\nby (27) and 28(a) to (d).\n\nThere are several proposals in the literature that elucidate the\nrelation between a sentence and the situations or events that\nexemplify it by positing a special recursive mechanism that relates\nsentences to the set of exemplifying events or situations (see Schein\n1993, chapters 9 and 10 for discussion of this issue). Possibilistic\nversions of situation semantics typically start out with a recursive\ntruth definition that relates utterances of sentences to the sets of\npossible situations in which the utterances are true, the propositions\nexpressed. The situations or events that exemplify a proposition can\nthen be defined as the \u201cminimal\u201d situations in which the\nproposition is true (see the entries on\n events,\n facts,\n states of affairs,\n and truthmakers). The\nchallenge presented by sentences (27) and 28(a) to (d) is that they\nsuggest that a na\u00efve notion of minimality won\u2019t do. A more\nflexible notion of minimality seems to be needed. The following\nsection will document in some detail how the desired notion of\nminimality might emerge from a simple definition of exemplification in\ninteraction with independently justified sentence denotations. The\nissue is under active investigation, however, and cannot be considered\nsettled before a wide range of different constructions has been looked\nat. Whatever the ultimate outcome may be, the following discussion\nwill provide the opportunity to illustrate how the shift from possible\nworlds to situations affects the denotations we might want to posit\nfor an expression. In a situation semantics, there are often several\nways of assigning denotations to an expression that are hard to\ndistinguish on truth-conditional grounds. Looking at the situations\nthat exemplify a sentence as well as its truth-conditions helps with\nthe choice.\n",
