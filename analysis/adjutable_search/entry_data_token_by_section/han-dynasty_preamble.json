    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophy in early China underwent a major transformation after the\nbeginning of empire in the late third century BCE. These were the\nyears of the Han Dynasty, in its two parts, the Western Han (206\nBCE\u20139 CE) and Eastern Han (25\u2013220 CE). Some of the main\ntrends, ideas, and thinkers of the more than 400 years of the Han\nperiod are discussed in this article. Some of the particularly\nprominent features of Han philosophy in comparison with that of\nearlier periods are: increased focus on metaphysics , the prominence\nof syncretism, new views on language, the rise of naturalism, and\ndebates about methodology. In addition, many of the ideas we associate\nwith Pre-Qin philosophy were developed most fully in the Han.\nRetrospective interpretation in later years, including during the Han\nitself, led to our association of some of these ideas with earlier\ntexts and traditions. Many of the \u201cearly\u201d, pre-Han Chinese\ntexts were actually compiled or created during the Han (see Hunter\n2018; Klein 2010). Even the \u201cschool\u201d categories that we\noften use to classify texts and thinkers from periods prior to the\nHan, such as \u201cConfucianism\u201d (rujia\n\u5112\u5bb6), \u201cDaoism\u201d (daojia\n\u9053\u5bb6), Legalism (fajia \u6cd5\u5bb6), and so\non, were actually Han period creations. It is no exaggeration to say\nthat the Chinese philosophical tradition was founded as such\nduring the Han.\n",
