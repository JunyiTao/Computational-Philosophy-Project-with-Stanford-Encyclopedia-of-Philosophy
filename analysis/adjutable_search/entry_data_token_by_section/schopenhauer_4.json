    "main_text": "Transcending the Human Conditions of Conflict || Aesthetic Perception as a Mode of Transcendence\n5.1 Aesthetic Perception as a Mode of Transcendence\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s violent vision of the daily world sends him on a\nquest for tranquillity, and he pursues this by retracing the path\nthrough which Will objectifies itself. He discovers more peaceful\nstates of mind by directing his everyday, practically-oriented\nconsciousness towards more extraordinary, universal and\nless-individuated states of mind, since he believes that the violence\nthat a person experiences is proportional to the degree to which that\nperson\u2019s consciousness is individuated and objectifying. His\nview is that with less individuation and objectification, there is\nless conflict, less pain and more peace.\n\nOne way to achieve a more tranquil state of consciousness is through\naesthetic perception. This is a special state of perceptual\nconsciousness where we apprehend some spatio-temporal object and\ndiscern through this object, the object\u2019s essence, archetype, or\n\u201cPlatonic Idea\u201d that corresponds to the type of object in\nquestion. In this form of perception, we lose ourselves in the object,\nforget about our individuality, and become the clear mirror of the\nobject. During the aesthetic perception of an individual apple tree,\nfor example, we would perceive shining through the tree, the archetype\nof all apple trees (i.e., the Ur-phenomenon, as Goethe would describe\nit) in an appreciation of every apple tree that was, is, or will be.\nThe kind of perception involved compares, for example, to the\ntraditional portrait artist who discerns the shapes that nature\nintended to realize in a face, but that were not ideally realized. The\npainter consequently removes in the artistic portrait, the little\nhairs, warts, wrinkles and such, to present a more idealized, angelic,\ntimeless, and perfected facial presentation, as we might see in a\nwedding or religious portrait. \n\nSince Schopenhauer assumes that the quality of the subject of\nexperience must correspond to the quality of the object of experience,\nhe infers that in the state of aesthetic perception, where the objects\nare universalistic, the subject of experience must likewise assume a\nuniversalistic quality (WWR, Section 33). Aesthetic\nperception thus transforms an individually-oriented state of\nconsciousness to a universally-oriented state of consciousness, or\nwhat Schopenhauer calls a pure will-less, painless, and timeless\nsubject of knowledge (WWR, Section 34).\n\nFew people supposedly have the capacity to remain in such an aesthetic\nstate of mind for very long, and most are denied the transcendent\ntranquillity of aesthetic perception. Only the artistically-minded\ngenius is naturally disposed to and can supposedly remain at length in\nthe state of pure perception, and it is to these individuals\nSchopenhauer believes we must turn \u2013 as we appreciate their\nworks of art \u2013 to obtain a more concentrated and knowledgeable\nglimpse of the Platonic Ideas (i.e., into the essences of things). The\nartistic genius contemplates these Ideas, creates a work of art that\npresents the Ideas in a manner more clear and accessible than is usual, and\nthereby communicates a universalistic vision to those who lack the\nidealizing power to see through, and to rise above, the ordinary world\nof spatio-temporal objects.\n\nSchopenhauer states that the highest purpose of art is to communicate\nPlatonic Ideas (WWR, Section 50). As constituting art, he has\nin mind the traditional five fine arts minus music, namely,\narchitecture, sculpture, painting, and poetry. These four arts he\ncomprehends in relation to the Platonic Ideas \u2013 those universal\nobjects of aesthetic awareness that are located at the objective pole\nof the universal subject-object distinction at the root of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. Schopenhauer\u2019s account of the\nvisual and literary arts corresponds to the world as representation in\nits immediate objectification, namely, the field of Platonic Ideas as\nopposed to the field of spatio-temporal objects.\n\nAs a counterpart to his interpretation of the visual and literary\narts, Schopenhauer develops an account of music that coordinates it\nwith the subjective pole of the universal subject-object distinction.\nSeparate from the other traditional arts, he maintains that music is\nthe most metaphysical art and is on a subjective, feeling-centered\nparallel with the Platonic Ideas themselves. Just as the Platonic Ideas\ncontain the patterns for the types of objects in the daily world,\nmusic formally duplicates the basic structure of the world: the bass\nnotes are analogous to inorganic nature, the harmonies are analogous\nto the animal world, and the melodies are analogous to the human\nworld. The sounding of the bass note produces more subtle sonic\nstructures in its overtones; similarly, inanimate nature produces\nanimate life.\n\nIn the structure of music, Schopenhauer discerns a series of analogies\nto the structure of the physical world that allow him to claim that\nmusic is \u201ca copy of Will itself\u201d (Abbild des Willens selbst [italics in original German]) (WWR, Section 52). His view might seem extravagant upon\nfirst hearing, but it rests on the thought that if one is to discern\nthe truth of the world, it might be advantageous to apprehend the\nworld, not exclusively in scientific, mechanical and causal terms, but\nrather in aesthetic, analogical, expressive and metaphorical terms\nthat require a sense of taste for their discernment. If the form of\nthe world is best reflected in the form of music, then the most\nphilosophical sensibility will be a musical sensibility. This\npartially explains the positive attraction of Schopenhauer\u2019s\ntheory of music to creative spirits such as Richard Wagner and\nFriedrich Nietzsche, both of whom combined musical and philosophical\ninterests in their work.\n\nWith respect to the theme of achieving more peaceful and transcendent\nstates of mind, Schopenhauer believes that music achieves this by\nembodying the abstract forms of feelings, or feelings abstracted from\ntheir particular everyday circumstances. This allows us to perceive\nthe essences of emotional life \u2013 \u201csadness itself,\u201d\n\u201cjoy itself,\u201d etc. \u2013 without the contingent contents\nthat would typically cause suffering. By expressing emotion in this\ndetached way, music allows us to apprehend the nature of the world\nwithout the frustration involved in daily life, and hence, in a mode\nof aesthetic awareness akin to the tranquil philosophical\ncontemplation of the world. Insofar as music provides an abstract and\npainless vision of the world and of inner life, however, it also fails\nto evoke the compassion that issues from identifying tangibly with\nanother person\u2019s suffering. This deficiency motivates a shift\nfrom musical, or aesthetic, awareness to moral awareness.\n",
