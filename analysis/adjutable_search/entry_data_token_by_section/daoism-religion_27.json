    "main_text": "Soteriology || The Immortals\n6.1 The Immortals\n\nAccording to hagiographic works, the Daoist immortals are historical,\nsemi-historical, or entirely legendary persons who transcend the\nlimits of ordinary human existence, sometimes by birth but usually by means of their practices. As\ndescribed by Benjamin Penny (2000: 125\u201326), their powers include\nthe ability to transform themselves into different creatures or\nobjects; the possession of extraordinary bodies, devoid of signs of\naging and capable of stunning feats; the skill of controlling people,\nanimals, and objects by means of mastery of qi (the\nlife-giving \u201cbreath\u201d); the gift of healing; and the\nfaculty of predicting the future. The main power possessed by the\nimmortals, however, is certainly the ability to reach indefinitely\nlong lifespans. It is especially in hagiographic works that the idea\nof human \u201cperfectibility\u201d is understood in a sense that\nis, at the same time, most elementary and most idealistic: not only an\nexceptional longevity, but also the immortality of the physical\nbody.\n\nThe earliest extant hagiographic collections are the Liexian\nzhuan (Biographies of Exemplary Immortals; Kaltenmark 1953),\nprobably dating from the 1st century BCE, and the\nShenxian zhuan (Biographies of Divine Immortals; Campany\n2002), traditionally attributed to Ge Hong although no conclusive\nevidence is available about his authorship (Penny 1996). With the\nexception of works devoted to a single deity (in particular, Laozi in\nhis divine aspect; Kohn 1998: 7\u201336), hagiographies contain\nexemplary stories about men and women who have risen to a saintly\nstate (but not a \u201cgodlike\u201d state: the immortals are not\ngods). These stories are often related to local cults and reflect oral\ntraditions, but are typically composed by literati, including some who\ndo not have much to do with Daoism but are interested in the\n\u201cextraordinary\u201d and the unusual, or in the preservation of\nlocal traditions. More importantly, hagiographic works are intended\nfor open circulation and are not the object of transmission among\ninitiated or ordained Daoists. One may read them as\n\u201cintroductions to Daoism\u201d addressed to the general public,\nwhose knowledge of their subject matter often would not go much beyond\nwhat they read there.\n",
