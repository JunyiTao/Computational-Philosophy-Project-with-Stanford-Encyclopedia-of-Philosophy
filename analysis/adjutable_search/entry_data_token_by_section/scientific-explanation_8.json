What Sorts of Examples are Accounts of Statistical Explanation Intended to Capture?\n\nStepping back from the issues (such as the status of the high\nprobability requirement) that have dominated discussions of\nstatistical explanation, there are several more general issues that\ndeserve mention. One is that these models have been applied to a range\nof examples that seem prima-facie to be quite different, including\nquantum mechanical examples (e.g., radioactive decay) but also more\nordinary examples such as recovery from disease and (to use an example\nof Salmon\u2019s) causes of juvenile delinquency. Radioactive decay\nis a process that is usually taken to be irreducibly indeterministic\nand hence is the sort of thing that Salmon\u2019s objective\nhomogeneity requirement is designed to capture. By contrast, although\nthe evidence for many models of juvenile delinquency comes from\npopulation level statistics these models do not assume that\ndelinquency is the outcome of an irreducibly indeterministic process\n(and the models themselves are very far from satisfying an objective\nhomogeneity requirement). Indeed, taken literally, standard causal\nmodels assume the opposite: the assumed equations are deterministic\nwith the stochastic element supplied by an \u201cerror term\u201d.\nThis raises the question of whether it is sensible to look for a\nsingle model that captures all of these examples.\n\nA second, more radical assessment focuses on the question of whether\nit is appropriate to think of the sorts of statistical theories and\nhypotheses on which Hempel and Salmon discuss as explaining individual\nevents or outcomes at all. For example, why not instead take quantum\nmechanics to explain (i) the probabilities with which\nindividual outcomes like decay events occur but not (ii) those\nindividual outcomes themselves? If we adopt (i) the relationship\nbetween a quantum mechanical model and such explananda will be\ndeductive and thus subsumable under whatever model of deductive\nexplanation we favor. This raises the question of what additional work\nis accomplished by models of statistical explanation of either the\nIS or SR sort. \n",
