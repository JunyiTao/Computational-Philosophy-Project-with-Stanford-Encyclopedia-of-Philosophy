    "main_text": "\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein\u2019s reflections on\nrule-following\u2014principally, sections 138\u2013242 of\nPhilosophical Investigations and section VI of Remarks on\nthe Foundations of Mathematics\u2014raise a series of provoking\nquestions and puzzles about the nature of language and thought. The\nliterature on this topic is vast. We\u2019ll structure our discussion\naround Saul Kripke\u2019s Wittgenstein on Rules and Private\nLanguage (1982), the most widely discussed commentary on\nWittgenstein on\n rule-following.[1]\n In this book, Kripke\u2019s Wittgenstein famously develops a\n\u201csceptical challenge\u201d to the idea that that there are\nfacts about the meanings of linguistic expressions and contents of\nthoughts, and goes on to propose a \u201csceptical solution\u201d to\nthe challenge, which attempts to preserve the propriety of talk of\nmeaning and content while conceding to the sceptic the non-existence\nof the kind of semantic or intentional facts on which she casts doubt.\nAfter some preliminary comments about rules, meaning, and content\n(\u00a71), we\u2019ll outline the sceptical argument (\u00a72), and\nwe\u2019ll offer an overview of some of the main responses to it.\nFirst, we\u2019ll discuss sceptical responses of the sort proposed by\nKripke\u2019s Wittgenstein himself (\u00a73). Then, we\u2019ll\nconsider straight responses, which advance candidate\nmeaning-constituting facts. We\u2019ll examine in detail the two\nforms of straight solution that are most widely discussed in the\nsecondary literature, reductive dispositionalism (\u00a74) and\nnon-reductionism (\u00a75). \n\nFor the purposes of this entry, we\u2019ll understand\n\u2018intentionality\u2019 in a broad sense, so that it covers the\nmeanings of linguistic expressions (and utterances) and also the\ncontents of propositional attitudes. Clearly, these notions are\nclosely related: just as we can say of the sentence \u2018\\(68\n+ 57 = 125\\)\u2019 that it means\nthat 68 plus 57 is 125, we can say of Octavia\u2019s belief\nthat it has the content that 68 plus 57 is 125 (or that\nOctavia believes that 68 plus 57 is 125).\n",
