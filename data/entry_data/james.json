    "preamble": "\n\nWilliam James was an original thinker in and between the disciplines\nof physiology, psychology and philosophy. His twelve-hundred page\nmasterwork, The Principles of Psychology (1890), is a rich\nblend of physiology, psychology, philosophy, and personal reflection\nthat has given us such ideas as \u201cthe stream of thought\u201d\nand the baby\u2019s impression of the world \u201cas one great\nblooming, buzzing confusion\u201d (PP 462). It contains seeds of\npragmatism and phenomenology, and influenced generations of thinkers\nin Europe and America, including Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell,\nJohn Dewey, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. James studied at Harvard\u2019s\nLawrence Scientific School and the School of Medicine, but his\nwritings were from the outset as much philosophical as scientific.\n\u201cSome Remarks on Spencer\u2019s Notion of Mind as\nCorrespondence\u201d (1878) and \u201cThe Sentiment of\nRationality\u201d (1879, 1882) presage his future pragmatism and\npluralism, and contain the first statements of his view that\nphilosophical theories are reflections of a philosopher\u2019s\ntemperament.\n\nJames hints at his religious concerns in his earliest essays and in\nThe Principles, but they become more explicit in The Will\nto Believe and Other Essays in Popular Philosophy (1897),\nHuman Immortality: Two Supposed Objections to the Doctrine\n(1898), The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902) and\nA Pluralistic Universe (1909). James oscillated between\nthinking that a \u201cstudy in human nature\u201d such as\nVarieties could contribute to a \u201cScience of\nReligion\u201d and the belief that religious experience involves an\naltogether supernatural domain, somehow inaccessible to science but\naccessible to the individual human subject. \n\nJames made some of his most important philosophical contributions in\nthe last decade of his life. In a burst of writing in 1904\u20135\n(collected in  Essays in Radical Empiricism (1912)) he set\nout the metaphysical view most commonly known as \u201cneutral\nmonism,\u201d according to which there is one fundamental\n\u201cstuff\u201d that is neither material nor mental.  In\n\u201cA Pluralistic Universe\u201d he defends the mystical and\nanti-pragmatic view that concepts distort rather than reveal reality,\nand in his influential Pragmatism (1907), he presents\nsystematically a set of views about truth, knowledge, reality,\nreligion, and philosophy that permeate his writings from the late\n1870s onwards.\n",

Early Writings\n\u201cRemarks on Spencer\u2019s Definition of Mind as Correspondence\u201d (1878)\n\nAlthough he was officially a professor of psychology when he published\nit, James\u2019s discussion of Herbert Spencer broaches\ncharacteristic themes of his philosophy: the importance of religion\nand the passions, the variety of human responses to life, and the idea\nthat we help to \u201ccreate\u201d the truths that we\n\u201cregister\u201d (E 21). Taking up Spencer\u2019s view that the\nadjustment of the organism to the environment is the basic feature of\nmental evolution, James charges that Spencer projects his own vision\nof what ought to be onto the phenomena he claims to describe.\nSurvival, James asserts, is merely one of many interests human beings\nhave: \u201cThe social affections, all the various forms of play, the\nthrilling intimations of art, the delights of philosophic\ncontemplation, the rest of religious emotion, the joy of moral\nself-approbation, the charm of fancy and of wit\u2014some or all of\nthese are absolutely required to make the notion of mere existence\ntolerable;\u2026\u201d (E 13). We are all teleological creatures at\nbase, James holds, each with a set of a priori values and\ncategories. Spencer \u201cmerely takes sides with the telos\nhe happens to prefer\u201d (E 18).\n\nJames\u2019s characteristic empiricism appears in his claim that\nvalues and categories fight it out in the course of human experience,\nand that their conflicts \u201ccan only be solved ambulando,\nand not by any a priori definition.\u201d The \u201cformula\nwhich proves to have the most massive destiny,\u201d he concludes,\n\u201cwill be the true one\u201d (E 17). Yet James wishes to defend\nhis sense that any such formulation will be determined as much by a\nfreely-acting human mind as by the world, a position he later (in\nPragmatism) calls \u201chumanism\u201d: \u201cthere\nbelongs to mind, from its birth upward, a spontaneity, a vote. It is\nin the game, and not a mere looker-on; and its judgments of the\nshould-be, its ideals, cannot be peeled off from the body of the\ncogitandum as if they were excrescences\u2026\u201d (E 21).\n\u201cThe Sentiment of Rationality\u201d (1879, 1882)\n\nThe substance of this essay was first published in Mind in\n1879 and in the Princeton Review in 1882, and then\nrepublished in The Will to Believe and Other Essays in Popular\nPhilosophy in 1897. Although he never quite says that rationality\nis a sentiment, James holds that a sentiment\u2014really a set of\nsentiments\u2014is a \u201cmark\u201d of rationality. The\nphilosopher, James writes, will recognize the rationality of a\nconception \u201cas he recognizes everything else, by certain\nsubjective marks with which it affects him. When he gets the marks, he\nmay know that he has got the rationality.\u201d These marks include a\n\u201cstrong feeling of ease, peace, rest\u201d (WB 57), and a\n\u201cfeeling of the sufficiency of the present moment, of its\nabsoluteness\u201d (WB 58). There is also a \u201cpassion for\nparsimony\u201d (WB 58) that is felt in grasping theoretical\nunifications, as well as a passion for distinguishing, a\n\u201cloyalty to clearness and integrity of perception, dislike of\nblurred outlines, of vague identifications\u201d (WB 59). The ideal\nphilosopher, James holds, blends these two passions of rationality,\nand even some great philosophers go too far in one direction or\nanother: Spinoza\u2019s unity of all things in one substance is\n\u201cbarren,\u201d as is Hume\u2019s \u201c\u2018looseness and\nseparateness\u2019 of everything\u2026\u201d (WB 60).\n\nSentiments of rationality operate not just in logic or science, but in\nordinary life. When we first move into a room, for example, \u201cwe\ndo not know what draughts may blow in upon our back, what doors may\nopen, what forms may enter, what interesting objects may be found in\ncupboards and corners.\u201d These minor uncertainties act as\n\u201cmental irritant[s],\u201d which disappear when we come to know\nour way around the room, to \u201cfeel at home\u201d there (WB\n67\u20138).\n\nJames begins the second part of his essay by considering the case when\n\u201ctwo conceptions [are] equally fit to satisfy the logical\ndemand\u201d for fluency or unification. At this point, he holds, one\nmust consider a \u201cpractical\u201d component of rationality. The\nconception that \u201cawakens the active impulses, or satisfies other\naesthetic demands better than the other, will be accounted the more\nrational conception, and will deservedly prevail\u201d (WB 66). James\nputs the point both as one of psychology\u2014a prediction of what\nwill occur\u2014and as one of judgment, for he holds that it will\nprevail \u201cdeservedly.\u201d \n\nAs in his essay on Spencer, James explores the relations between\ntemperaments and philosophical theorizing. Idealism, he holds,\n\u201cwill be chosen by a man of one emotional constitution,\nmaterialism by another.\u201d Idealism offers a sense of intimacy\nwith the universe, the feeling that ultimately I \u201cam all.\u201d\nBut materialists find in idealism \u201ca narrow, close, sick-room\nair,\u201d and prefer to conceive of an uncertain, dangerous and wild\nuniverse that has \u201cno respect for our ego.\u201d Let \u201cthe\ntides flow,\u201d the materialist thinks, \u201ceven though they\nflow over us\u201d (WB 76). James is sympathetic both to the idea\nthat the universe is something we can be intimate with and to the idea\nthat it is wild and unpredictable. If he criticizes idealism for its\n\u201csick-room air,\u201d he criticizes reductive forms of\nmaterialism for denying to \u201cour most intimate powers\u2026all\nrelevancy in universal affairs\u201d (WB 71). The intimacy and the\nwildness portrayed in these contrasting philosophies answer to\npropensities, passions, and powers in human beings, and the\n\u201cstrife\u201d of these two forms of \u201cmental\ntemper,\u201d James predicts, will always be seen in philosophy (WB\n76). Certainly it is always seen in the philosophy of William James.\n\n3. The Principles of Psychology\n\nIn 1878, James agreed to write a psychology textbook for the American\npublisher Henry Holt, but it took him twelve years to produce the\nmanuscript, and when he did he described it to Holt as \u201ca\nloathsome, distended, tumefied, bloated, dropsical mass, testifying to\nnothing but two facts: 1st, that there is no such thing as a\nscience of psychology, and 2nd, that W. J. is an\nincapable\u201d (The Letters of William James, ed. Henry\nJames. (Boston: Little, Brown, 1926, pp. 393\u20134). Nevertheless,\nthis thousand page volume of psychology, physiology and philosophy has\nproved to be James\u2019s masterwork, containing early statements of\nhis main philosophical ideas in extraordinarily rich chapters on\n\u201cThe Stream of Thought,\u201d \u201cThe Consciousness of\nSelf,\u201d \u201cEmotion,\u201d \u201cWill,\u201d and many other\ntopics.\n\nJames tells us that he will follow the psychological method of\nintrospection in The Principles, which he defines as\n\u201cthe looking into our own minds and reporting what we there\ndiscover\u201d (PP 185). In fact he takes a number of methodological\napproaches in the book. Early on, he includes chapters on \u201cThe\nFunctions of the Brain\u201d and \u201cOn Some General Conditions of\nBrain Activity\u201d that reflect his years as a lecturer in anatomy\nand physiology at Harvard, and he argues for the reductive and\nmaterialist thesis that habit is \u201cat bottom a physical\nprinciple\u201d (PP 110). As the book moves along, he involves\nhimself in discussions with philosophers\u2014for example with Hume\nand Kant in his hundred-page chapter on the self, and he finds himself\nmaking metaphysical claims that anticipate his later pragmatism, as\nwhen he writes: \u201cThere is no property ABSOLUTELY essential\nto any one thing. The same property which figures as the essence\nof a thing on one occasion becomes a very inessential feature on the\nother\u201d (PP 959).\n\nEven \u201cintrospection\u201d covers a range of reports. James\ndiscusses the experiments that his contemporaries Wundt, Stumpf and\nFechner were performing in their laboratories, which led them to\nresults such as that \u201csounds are less delicately discriminated\nin intensity than lights\u201d (PP 513).  But many of\nJames\u2019s most important and memorable introspective observations\ncome from his own life. For example:\n\nThe rhythm of a lost word may be there without a sound to clothe\nit\u2026. Everyone must know the tantalizing effect of the blank\nrhythm of some forgotten verse, restlessly dancing in one\u2019s\nmind, striving to be filled out with words (PP 244).\n\n\nOur father and mother, our wife and babes, are bone of our bone and\nflesh of our flesh. When they die, a part of our very selves is gone.\nIf they do anything wrong, it is our shame. If they are insulted, our\nanger flashes forth as readily as if we stood in their place. (PP\n280).\n\nThere is an excitement during the crying fit which is not without a\ncertain pungent pleasure of its own; but it would take a genius for\nfelicity to discover any dash of redeeming quality in the feeling of\ndry and shrunken sorrow (PP 1061).\n\n\u201cWill you or won\u2019t you have it so?\u201d is the\nmost probing question we are ever asked; we are asked it every hour of\nthe day, and about the largest as well as the smallest, the most\ntheoretical as well as the most practical, things. We answer by\nconsents or non-consents and not by words. What wonder that\nthese dumb responses should seem our deepest organs of communication\nwith the nature of things! (PP, p. 1182). \n\n\nIn this last quotation, James tackles a philosophical problem from a\npsychological perspective. Although he refrains from answering the\nquestion of whether these \u201cresponses\u201d are in fact deep\norgans of communication with the nature of things\u2014reporting only\nthat they seem to us to be so\u2014in his later writings, such as\nVarieties of Religious Experience and A Pluralistic\nUniverse, he confesses, and to some degree defends, his belief\nthat the question should be answered affirmatively. \n\nIn the deservedly famous chapter on \u201cThe Stream of\nThought\u201d James takes himself to be offering a richer account of\nexperience than those of traditional empiricists such as Hume. He\nbelieves relations, vague fringes, and tendencies are experienced\ndirectly (a view he would later defend as part of his \u201cradical\nempiricism.\u201d) James finds consciousness to be a stream rather\nthan a succession of \u201cideas.\u201d Its waters blend, and our\nindividual consciousness\u2014or, as he prefers to call it sometimes,\nour \u201csciousness\u201d\u2014is \u201csteeped and dyed\u201d\nin the waters of sciousness or thought that surround it. Our psychic\nlife has rhythm: it is a series of transitions and resting-places, of\n\u201cflights and perchings\u201d (PP 236). We rest when we remember\nthe name we have been searching for; and we are off again when we hear\na noise that might be the baby waking from her nap.\n\nInterest\u2014and its close relative, attention\u2014is a major\ncomponent not only of James\u2019s psychology, but of the\nepistemology and metaphysics that seep into his discussion. A thing,\nJames states in \u201cThe Stream of Thought,\u201d is a group of\nqualities \u201cwhich happen practically or aesthetically to interest\nus, to which we therefore give substantive names\u2026\u201d. (PP\n274). And reality \u201cmeans simply relation to our emotional\nand active life\u2026whatever excites and stimulates our interest is\nreal\u201d (PP 924). Our capacity for attention to one thing\nrather than another is for James the sign of an \u201cactive\nelement in all consciousness,\u2026a spiritual\nsomething\u2026which seems to go out to meet these qualities and\ncontents, whilst they seem to come in to be received by it.\u201d (PP\n285). Faced with the tension between scientific determinism and our\nbelief in our own freedom or autonomy, James\u2014speaking not as a\npsychologist but as the philosopher he had become\u2014argues that\nscience \u201cmust be constantly reminded that her purposes are not\nthe only purposes, and that the order of uniform causation which she\nhas use for, and is therefore right in postulating, may be enveloped\nin a wider order, on which she has no claims at all\u201d (PP\n1179).\n\nIn his discussions of consciousness James appears at various times to\nbe a reductive materialist, a dualist, a proto-phenomenologist, and a\nneutral psychologist who wouldn\u2019t dare to consider philosophical\nquestions. One of the most original layers of The Principles\nlies in James\u2019s pursuit of a \u201cpure\u201d description of\nthe stream of thought that does not presuppose it to be either mental\nor material, a pursuit that anticipates not only his own later\n\u201cradical empiricism,\u201d but Husserl\u2019s phenomenology.\nIn his chapter on \u201cSensation,\u201d for example, James is at\npains to deny that sensations are \u201cin the mind\u201d and then\n\u201cby a special act on our part \u2018extradited\u2019 or\n\u2018projected\u2019 so as to appear located in an outer\nworld\u201d (PP 678). He argues that our original experiences are\nobjective, that \u201conly as reflection becomes developed do we\nbecome aware of an inner world at all\u201d (PP 679). However, the\nobjective world originally experienced is not the world of spatial\nrelations that we think: \n\nCertainly a child newly born in Boston, who gets a sensation from the\ncandle-flame which lights the bedroom, or from his diaper-pin [who]\ndoes not feel either of these objects to be situated in longitude 71\nW. and latitude 42 N.\u2026.The flame fills its own place, the pain\nfills its own place; but as yet these places are neither identified\nwith, nor discriminated from, any other places. That comes\nlater.  For the places thus first sensibly known are elements of\nthe child\u2019s space-world which remain with him all his life. (PP\n681\u20132)\n\n\nJames\u2019s chapter on \u201cHabit,\u201d early in the book,\nbegins with habit as a physical matter but ends by considering its\nethical implications. James argues that the laws of nature are\nthemselves habits, \u201cnothing but the immutable habits which the\ndifferent elementary sorts of matter follow in their actions and\nreactions upon each other\u201d (PP 109). In our brains, habits are\npaths of nervous energy, as rivers and streams are the paths of\nwater\u2019s flow. At skin level, even a scar is a kind of habit,\n\u201cmore likely to be abraded, inflamed, to suffer pain and cold,\nthan are the neighboring parts\u201d (PP 111). On the psychological\nlevel as well, \u201cany sequence of mental action which has been\nfrequently repeated, tends to perpetuate itself ...\u201d (PP 116).\nHabits are useful in diminishing the attention that we have to devote\nto our actions, thereby allowing us to develop \u201cour higher\npowers of mind\u201d (PP 126). On the social level, habit is\n\u201cthe enormous fly-wheel of society, its most precious\nconservative agent. It alone is what keeps us all within the bounds of\nordinance, and saves the children of fortune from the envious\nuprisings of the poor\u201d (PP 125). The \u201cethical implications\nof the law of habit,\u201d (PP 124) as James sees them, concern which\nhabits we choose to develop, and when. Many habits must begin early in\nlife: \u201cHardly ever is a language learned after twenty spoken\nwithout a foreign accent\u201d (PP 126). We should strive to make our\n\u201cnervous system our ally instead of our enemy\u201d by forming\nas many good habits as we can, as early in life as we can. Even later\nin life, we are to keep our capacity for resolution in shape by every\nday or two doing \u201csomething for no other reason than that you\nwould rather not do it\u201d (PP 130).\n\nTwo noteworthy chapters late in The Principles are \u201cThe\nEmotions\u201d and \u201cWill.\u201d The first sets out the\ntheory\u2014also enunciated by the Danish physiologist Carl\nLange\u2014that emotion follows, rather than causes, its bodily\nexpression: \u201cCommon-sense says, we lose our fortune, are sorry\nand weep; we meet a bear, are frightened and run; we are insulted by a\nrival, are angry and strike. The hypothesis here to be defended says\nthat this order of sequence is incorrect\u2026that we feel sorry\nbecause we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we\ntremble\u2026\u201d (PP 1065\u20136). The significance of this\nview, according to James, is that our emotions are tied in with our\nbodily expressions. What, he asks, would grief be \u201cwithout its\ntears, its sobs, its suffocation of the heart, its pang in the\nbreast-bone?\u201d Not an emotion, James answers, for a \u201cpurely\ndisembodied human emotion is a nonentity\u201d (PP 1068).\n\nIn his chapter on \u201cWill\u201d James opposes the theory of his\ncontemporary Wilhelm Wundt that there is one special feeling\u2014a\n\u201cfeeling of innervation\u201d\u2014present in all intentional\naction.  In his survey of a range of cases, James finds that some\nactions involve an act of resolve or of outgoing nervous energy, but\nothers do not. For example:\n\nI sit at table after dinner and find myself from time to time taking\nnuts or raisins out of the dish and eating them. My dinner properly is\nover, and in the heat of the conversation I am hardly aware of what I\ndo; but the perception of the fruit, and the fleeting notion that I\nmay eat it, seem fatally to bring the act about. There is certainly no\nexpress fiat here;\u2026 (PP 1131).\n\n\nThe chapter on \u201cWill\u201d also contains striking passages that\nanticipate the concerns of The Varieties of Religious\nExperience:  about moods, \u201cchanges of heart,\u201d\nand \u201cawakenings of conscience.\u201d  These, James\nobserves, may affect the \u201cwhole scale of values of our motives\nand impulses\u201d (PP 1140). \n4. Essays in Popular Philosophy\n\nJames\u2019s popular and influential, The Will to Believe and\nOther Essays in Popular Philosophy, published in 1897, collects\npreviously published essays from the previous nineteen years,\nincluding \u201cThe Sentiment of Rationality\u201d (discussed\nabove), \u201cThe Dilemma of Determinism,\u201d \u201cGreat Men and\nTheir Environment\u201d and \u201cThe Moral Philosopher and the\nMoral Life.\u201d The title essay\u2014published just two years\nearlier\u2014proved to be controversial for seeming to recommend\nirresponsible or irrationally held beliefs. James later wrote that he\nshould have called the essay \u201cthe right to\nbelieve,\u201d to indicate his intent to justify holding\ncertain beliefs in certain circumstances, not to claim that\nwe can (or should) believe things simply by an act of will.\n\nIn science, James notes, we can afford to await the outcome of\ninvestigation before coming to a belief, but in other cases we are\n\u201cforced,\u201d in that we must come to some belief even if all\nthe relevant evidence is not in. If I am on an isolated mountain\ntrail, faced with an icy ledge to cross, and do not know whether I can\nmake it, I may be forced to consider the question whether I can or\nshould believe that I can cross the ledge. This question is not only\nforced, it is \u201cmomentous\u201d: if I am wrong I may fall to my\ndeath, and if I believe rightly that I can cross the ledge, my holding\nof the belief may itself contribute to my success. In such a case,\nJames asserts, I have the \u201cright to\nbelieve\u201d\u2014precisely because such a belief may help bring\nabout the fact believed in. This is a case \u201cwhere a fact cannot\ncome at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming\u201d\n(WB, 25).\n\nJames applies his analysis to religious belief, particularly to the\npossible case in which one\u2019s salvation depends on believing in\nGod in advance of any proof that God exists. In such a case the belief\nmay be justified by the outcome to which having the belief\nleads.  He extends his analysis beyond the religious domain,\nhowever, to a wide range of secular human life:\n\nA social organism of any sort is what it is because each member\nproceeds to his own duty with a trust that the other members will\nsimultaneously do theirs\u2026. A government, an army, a commercial\nsystem, a ship, a college, an athletic team, all exist on this\ncondition, without which not only is nothing achieved, but nothing is\neven attempted (WB 24).\n\n\nMoral questions too are both momentous and unlikely to be sustained by\n\u201csensible proof.\u201d They are not matters of science but of\n\u201cwhat Pascal calls our heart\u201d (WB 22). James defends our\nright to believe in certain answers to these questions anyway.\n\nAnother essay in the collection, \u201cReflex Action and\nTheism,\u201d attempts a reconciliation of science and religion.\nJames\u2019s expression \u201creflex action\u201d alludes to the\nbiological picture of the organism as responding to sensations with a\nseries of actions. In the higher animals a theoretical or thinking\nstage intervenes between sensation and action, and this is where, in\nhuman beings, the thought of God arises. James maintains that this\nthought is a natural human response to the universe, independent of\nany proof that God exists, and he predicts that God will be the\n\u201ccentre of gravity of all attempts to solve the riddle of\nlife\u201d (WB, 116). He ends the essay by advocating a\n\u201ctheism\u201d that posits \u201can ultimate opacity in things,\na dimension of being which escapes our theoretic control\u201d (WB\n143).\n\nThe Will to Believe also contains James\u2019s most\ndeveloped account of morality, \u201cThe Moral Philosopher and the\nMoral Life.\u201d  Morality for James rests on\nsentience\u2014without it there are no moral claims and no moral\nobligations. But once sentience exists, a claim is made, and morality\ngets \u201ca foothold in the universe\u201d (WB 198). Although James\ninsists that there is no common essence to morality, he does find a\nguiding principle for ethical philosophy in the principle that we\n\u201csatisfy at all times as many demands as we can\u201d (WB 205).\nThis satisfaction is to be achieved by working towards a \u201cricher\nuniverse\u2026the good which seems most organizable, most fit to\nenter into complex combinations, most apt to be a member of a more\ninclusive whole\u201d (WB 210). This work proceeds by a series of\nexperiments, by means of which we have learned to live (for the most\npart) without \u201cpolygamy and slavery, private warfare and liberty\nto kill, judicial torture and arbitrary royal power.\u201d (WB\n205) . However, James holds that there is \u201cnothing final in\nany actually given equilibrium of human ideals, [so that] as our\npresent laws and customs have fought and conquered other past ones, so\nthey will in their turn be overthrown by any newly discovered order\nwhich will hush up the complaints that they still give rise to,\nwithout producing others louder still\u201d (WB 206).\n\nJames\u2019s essay \u201cOn a Certain Blindness in Human\nBeings,\u201d published in his Talks to Teachers on Psychology\nand to Students on Some of Life\u2019s Ideals in 1899,\nillustrates another important element of James\u2019s moral outlook.\nThe blindness to which James draws attention is that of one human\nbeing to another, a blindness he illustrates with a story from his own\nlife. Riding in the mountains of North Carolina he comes upon a\ndevastated landscape, with no trees, scars in the earth, here and\nthere a patch of corn growing in the sunlight. But after talking to\nthe settlers who had cleared the forest to make room for their farm,\nJames comes to see it their way (at least temporarily): not as\ndevastation but as a manifestation of \u201cduty, struggle, and\nsuccess.\u201d James concludes: \u201cI had been as blind to the\npeculiar ideality of their conditions as they certainly would also\nhave been to the ideality of mine, had they had a peep at my strange\nindoor academic ways of life at Cambridge\u201d (TT 233\u20134).\nJames portrays a plurality of outlooks in the essay to which he\nattaches both a metaphysical/epistemological and an ethical import.\nThis plurality, he writes:\n\ncommands us to tolerate, respect, and indulge those whom we see\nharmlessly interested and happy in their own ways, however\nunintelligible these may be to us. Hands off: neither the whole of\ntruth nor the whole of good is revealed to any single observer,\nalthough each observer gains a partial superiority of insight from the\npeculiar position in which he stands. Even prisons and sick-rooms have\ntheir special revelations (TT 264).\n\n\nAlthough \u201cOn a Certain Blindness\u201d is about toleration and\nthe appreciation of different points of view, James sets out his own\nromantic point of view in his choice of heroes in the essay:\nWordsworth and Shelley, Emerson, and W. H. Hudson, all of whom are\nsaid to have a sense of the \u201climitless significance in natural\nthings\u201d (TT 244). Even in the city, there is \u201cunfathomable\nsignificance and importance\u201d (TT 254) in the daily events of the\nstreets, the river, and the crowds of people. James praises Walt\nWhitman, \u201ca hoary loafer,\u201d for knowing how to profit by\nlife\u2019s common opportunities: after a morning of writing and a\nbath, Whitman rides the omnibus down Broadway from 23rd street to\nBowling Green and back, just for the pleasure and the spectacle of it.\n\u201c[W]ho knows the more of truth,\u201d James asks,\n\u201cWhitman on his omnibus-top, full of the inner joy with which\nthe spectacle inspires him, or you, full of the disdain which the\nfutility of his occupation excites?\u201d (TT 252). James\u2019s\ninterest in the inner lives of others, and in writers like Tolstoy who\nshare his understanding of their \u201cmysterious ebbs and\nflows\u201d (TT 255), leads him to the prolonged study of human\nreligious experience that he presented as the Gifford Lectures in\n1901\u20132, published as The Varieties of Religious\nExperience in 1902.\n5. The Varieties of Religious Experience\n\nLike The Principles of Psychology, Varieties is\n\u201cA Study in Human Nature,\u201d as its subtitle says. But at\nsome five hundred pages it is only half the length of The\nPrinciples of Psychology, befitting its more restricted, if still\nlarge, scope. For James studies that part of human nature that is, or\nis related to, religious experience. His interest is not in religious\ninstitutions, ritual, or, even for the most part, religious ideas, but\nin \u201cthe feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in\ntheir solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in\nrelation to whatever they may consider the divine\u201d (V 31).\n\nJames sets out a central distinction of the book in early chapters on\n\u201cThe Religion of Healthy-Mindedness\u201d and \u201cThe Sick\nSoul.\u201d The healthy-minded religious person\u2014Walt Whitman is\none of James\u2019s main examples\u2014has a deep sense of\n\u201cthe goodness of life,\u201d (V 79) and a soul of\n\u201csky-blue tint\u201d (V 80). Healthy-mindedness can be\ninvoluntary, just natural to someone, but often comes in more willful\nforms. Liberal Christianity, for example, represents the triumph of a\nresolute devotion to healthy-mindedness over a morbid \u201cold\nhell-fire theology\u201d (V 91). James also cites the\n\u201cmind-cure movement\u201d of Mary Baker Eddy, for whom\n\u201cevil is simply a lie, and any one who mentions it is a\nliar\u201d (V 107). For \u201cThe Sick Soul,\u201d in contrast,\n\u201cradical evil gets its innings\u201d (V 163). No matter how\nsecure one may feel, the sick soul finds that \u201c[u]nsuspectedly\nfrom the bottom of every fountain of pleasure, as the old poet said,\nsomething bitter rises up: a touch of nausea, a falling dead of the\ndelight, a whiff of melancholy\u2026.\u201d These states are not\nsimply unpleasant sensations, for they bring \u201ca feeling of\ncoming from a deeper region and often have an appalling\nconvincingness\u201d (V 136).  James\u2019s main examples are\nLeo Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cMy Confession,\u201d John Bunyan\u2019s\nautobiography, and a report of terrifying\n\u201cdread\u201d\u2014allegedly from a French correspondent but\nactually from James himself. Some sick souls never get well, while\nothers recover or even triumph: these are the\n\u201ctwice-born.\u201d In chapters on \u201cThe Divided Self, and\nthe Process of Its Unification\u201d and on \u201cConversion,\u201d\nJames discusses St. Augustine, Henry Alline, Bunyan, Tolstoy, and a\nrange of popular evangelists, focusing on what he calls \u201cthe\nstate of assurance\u201d (V 247) they achieve. Central to this state\nis \u201cthe loss of all the worry, the sense that all is ultimately\nwell with one, the peace, the harmony, the willingness to be,\neven though the outer conditions should remain the same\u201d (V\n248).\n\nVarieties\u2019 classic chapter on \u201cMysticism\u201d\noffers \u201cfour marks which, when an experience has them, may\njustify us in calling it mystical\u2026\u201d (V 380). The first is\nineffability: \u201cit defies expression\u2026its quality must be\ndirectly experienced; it cannot be imparted or transferred to\nothers.\u201d Second is a \u201cnoetic quality\u201d: mystical\nstates present themselves as states of knowledge. Thirdly, mystical\nstates are transient; and, fourth, subjects are passive with respect\nto them: they cannot control their coming and going. Are these states,\nJames ends the chapter by asking, \u201cwindows through which the\nmind looks out upon a more extensive and inclusive world[?]\u201d (V\n428).\n\nIn chapters entitled \u201cPhilosophy\u201d\u2014devoted in large\npart to pragmatism\u2014and \u201cConclusions,\u201d James finds\nthat religious experience is on the whole useful, even \u201camongst\nthe most important biological functions of mankind,\u201d but he\nconcedes that this does not make it true. Nevertheless, James\narticulates his own belief\u2014which he does not claim to\nprove\u2014that religious experiences connect us with a greater, or\nfurther, reality not accessible in our normal cognitive relations to\nthe world: \u201cThe further limits of our being plunge, it seems to\nme, into an altogether other dimension of existence from the sensible\nand merely \u2018understandable\u2019 world\u201d (V 515).\n6. Late Writings\nPragmatism (1907)\n\nJames first announced his commitment to pragmatism in a lecture at\nBerkeley in 1898, entitled \u201cPhilosophical Conceptions and\nPractical Results.\u201d Later sources for Pragmatism were\nlectures at Wellesley College in 1905, and at the Lowell Institute and\nColumbia University in 1906 and 1907. Pragmatism emerges in\nJames\u2019s book as six things: a philosophical temperament, a\ntheory of truth, a theory of meaning, a holistic account of knowledge,\na metaphysical view, and a method of resolving philosophical\ndisputes.\n\nThe pragmatic temperament appears in the book\u2019s opening chapter,\nwhere (following a method he first set out in \u201cRemarks on\nSpencer\u2019s Definition of Mind as Correspondence\u201d) James\nclassifies philosophers according to their temperaments: in this case\n\u201ctough-minded\u201d or \u201ctender-minded.\u201d The\npragmatist is the mediator between these extremes, someone, like James\nhimself, with \u201cscientific loyalty to facts,\u201d but also\n\u201cthe old confidence in human values and the resultant\nspontaneity, whether of the religious or romantic type\u201d (P 17).\nThe method of resolving disputes and the theory of meaning are on\ndisplay in James\u2019s discussion of an argument about whether a man\nchasing a squirrel around a tree goes around the squirrel too. Taking\nmeaning as the  \u201cconceivable effects of a practical kind\nthe object may involve,\u201d the pragmatist philosopher finds that\ntwo \u201cpractical\u201d meanings of \u201cgo around\u201d are in\nplay: either the man goes North, East, South, and West of the\nsquirrel, or he faces first the squirrel\u2019s head, then one of his\nsides, then his tail, then his other side. \u201cMake the\ndistinction,\u201d James writes, \u201cand there is no occasion for\nany further dispute.\u201d\n\nThe pragmatic theory of truth is the subject of the book\u2019s sixth\n(and to some degree its second) chapter. Truth, James holds, is\n\u201ca species of the good,\u201d like health. Truths are goods\nbecause we can \u201cride\u201d on them into the future without\nbeing unpleasantly surprised. They \u201clead us into useful verbal\nand conceptual quarters as well as directly up to useful sensible\ntermini. They lead to consistency, stability and flowing human\nintercourse.  They lead away from excentricity and isolation,\nfrom foiled and barren thinking\u201d (103). Although James holds\nthat truths are \u201cmade\u201d (104) in the course of\nhuman experience, and that for the most part they live \u201con a\ncredit system\u201d in that they are not currently being verified, he\nalso holds the empiricistic view that \u201cbeliefs verified\nconcretely by somebody are the posts of the whole\nsuperstructure\u201d (P 100).\n\nJames\u2019s chapter on \u201cPragmatism and Humanism\u201d sets\nout his voluntaristic epistemology. \u201cWe carve out\neverything,\u201d James states, \u201cjust as we carve out\nconstellations, to serve our human purposes\u201d (P 100).\nNevertheless, he recognizes \u201cresisting factors in every\nexperience of truth-making\u201d (P 117), including not only our\npresent sensations or experiences but the whole body of our prior\nbeliefs. James holds neither that we create our truths out of nothing,\nnor that truth is entirely independent of humanity. He embraces\n\u201cthe humanistic principle: you can\u2019t weed out the human\ncontribution\u201d (P 122). He also embraces a metaphysics of\nprocess in the claim that \u201cfor pragmatism [reality] is still in\nthe making,\u201d whereas for \u201crationalism reality is\nready-made and complete from all eternity\u201d (P 123).\nPragmatism\u2019s final chapter on \u201cPragmatism and\nReligion\u201d follows James\u2019s line in Varieties in\nattacking \u201ctranscendental absolutism\u201d for its unverifiable\naccount of God, and in defending a \u201cpluralistic and moralistic\nreligion\u201d (144) based on human experience. \u201cOn\npragmatistic principles,\u201d James writes, \u201cif the hypothesis\nof God works satisfactorily in the widest sense of the word, it is\ntrue\u201d (143).\nA Pluralistic Universe (1909)\n\nOriginally delivered in Oxford as a set of lectures \u201cOn the\nPresent Situation in Philosophy,\u201d James begins his book, as he\nhad begun Pragmatism, with a discussion of the temperamental\ndetermination of philosophical theories, which, James states,\n\u201care just so many visions, modes of feeling the whole push\n\u2026 forced on one by one\u2019s total character and experience,\nand on the whole preferred\u2014there is no other truthful\nword\u2014as one\u2019s best working attitude\u201d (PU 15).\nMaintaining that a philosopher\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d is\n\u201cthe important thing\u201d about him (PU 3), James condemns the\n\u201cover-technicality and consequent dreariness of the younger\ndisciples at our American universities\u2026\u201d (PU 13).\n\nJames passes from critical discussions of Josiah Royce\u2019s\nidealism and the \u201cvicious intellectualism\u201d of Hegel to\nphilosophers whose visions he admires: Gustav Fechner and Henri\nBergson. He praises Fechner for holding that \u201cthe whole universe\nin its different spans and wave-lengths, exclusions and developments,\nis everywhere alive and conscious\u201d (PU, 70), and he seeks to\nrefine and justify Fechner\u2019s idea that separate human, animal\nand vegetable consciousnesses meet or merge in a \u201cconsciousness\nof still wider scope\u201d (PU 72). James employs Henri\nBergson\u2019s critique of \u201cintellectualism\u201d to argue\nthat the \u201cconcrete pulses of experience appear pent in by no\nsuch definite limits as our conceptual substitutes are confined by.\nThey run into one another continuously and seem to\ninterpenetrate\u201d (PU 127). James concludes by embracing a\nposition that he had more tentatively set forth in The Varieties\nof Religious Experience: that religious experiences \u201cpoint\nwith reasonable probability to the continuity of our consciousness\nwith a wider spiritual environment from which the ordinary prudential\nman (who is the only man that scientific psychology, so called, takes\ncognizance of) is shut off\u201d (PU 135). Whereas in\nPragmatism James subsumes the religious within the pragmatic\n(as yet another way of successfully making one\u2019s way through the\nworld), in A Pluralistic Universe he suggests that the\nreligious offers a superior relation to the universe.\nEssays in Radical Empiricism (1912)\n\nThis posthumous collection includes James\u2019s groundbreaking\nessays on \u201cpure experience,\u201d originally published in\n1904\u20135. James\u2019s fundamental idea is that mind and matter\nare both aspects of, or structures formed from, a more fundamental\nstuff\u2014pure experience\u2014that (despite being called\n\u201cexperience\u201d) is neither mental nor physical. Pure\nexperience, James explains, is \u201cthe immediate flux of life which\nfurnishes the material to our later reflection with its conceptual\ncategories\u2026 a that which is not yet any definite \nwhat, tho\u2019 ready to be all sorts of whats\u2026\u201d\n(ERE 46). That \u201cwhats\u201d pure experience may be are minds\nand bodies, people and material objects, but this depends not on a\nfundamental ontological difference among these \u201cpure\nexperiences,\u201d but on the relations into which they\nenter. Certain sequences of pure experiences constitute physical\nobjects, and others constitute persons; but one pure experience (say\nthe perception of a chair) may be part both of the sequence\nconstituting the chair and of the sequence constituting a person.\nIndeed, one pure experience might be part of two distinct minds, as\nJames explains in a chapter entitled \u201cHow Two Minds Can Know One\nThing.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019s \u201cradical empiricism\u201d is distinct from his\n\u201cpure experience\u201d metaphysics. It is never precisely\ndefined in the Essays, and is best explicated by a passage\nfrom The Meaning of Truth where James states that radical\nempiricism consists of a postulate, a statement of fact, and a\nconclusion. The postulate is that \u201cthe only things that shall be\ndebatable among philosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn\nfrom experience,\u201d the  fact is that relations are just as\ndirectly experienced as the things they relate, and the conclusion is\nthat \u201cthe parts of experience hold together from next to next by\nrelations that are themselves parts of experience\u201d (MT,\n6\u20137).\n\nJames was still working on objections to his \u201cpure\nexperience\u201d doctrine, replying to critics of\nPragmatism, and writing an introduction to philosophical\nproblems when he died in 1910. His legacy extends into psychology and\nthe study of religion, and in philosophy not only throughout the\npragmatist tradition that he founded (along with Charles Peirce), but\ninto phenomenology and analytic philosophy. Edmund Husserl\nincorporated James\u2019s notions of the \u201cfringe\u201d and\n\u201chalo\u201d into his phenomenology (Moran, pp. 276\u201380),\nBertrand Russell\u2019s The Analysis of Mind is indebted to\nJames\u2019s doctrine of \u201cpure experience,\u201d (Russell,\n1921, pp. 22\u20136), Ludwig Wittgenstein learned about \u201cthe\nabsence of the will act\u201d from James\u2019s Psychology\n(Goodman, Wittgenstein and William James, p. 81), and the\nversions of \u201cneopragmatism\u201d set out by Nelson Goodman,\nRichard Rorty and Hilary Putnam are saturated with James\u2019s\nideas. In physics, James\u2019s humanistic pragmatism, and his\nsuggestion that \u201cnew being come[s] in local spots and\npatches\u201d (P 138; Fuchs 2017, p.  33) have inspired the version\nof quantum theory known as QBism (see Healey). James is one of the\nmost attractive and endearing of philosophers: for his vision of a\n\u201cwild,\u201d \u201copen\u201d universe that is nevertheless\nshaped by our human powers and answers to some of our deepest needs,\nbut also, as Russell observed in his obituary, because of the\n\u201clarge tolerance and \u2026 humanity\u201d with which he sets\nthat vision out.
