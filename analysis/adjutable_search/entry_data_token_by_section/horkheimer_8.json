    "main_text": "The Critique of Reason and the Domination of Nature || The Domination of Outer and Inner Nature\n4.2 The Domination of Outer and Inner Nature\n\nInstrumental rationality necessarily involves the domination of\nnature. Taken in its most straightforward sense, this point has become\nsomething of a commonplace. As the sciences developed during the\nenlightenment period (and earlier, insofar as myth was already\nenlightenment), technology also developed, at the service of\nself-preservation. Technology involves making over nature for human\npurposes. This movement ends up thwarting human preservation, however,\ninsofar as the destruction of nature involves the destruction of\nhumanity. This now fairly common line of critique is complicated in\nHorkheimer\u2019s work from the 1940s, however, because instrumental\nrationality\u2019s distortion of \u201couter nature\u201d (nature\ntaken in the most straightforward sense), is directly tied to the\nrepression of \u201cinner nature.\u201d\n\nThe concept of \u201cinner nature\u201d is tied to the Freudian\nlibido theory already mentioned in \u00a72.1 above. Our inner life is\nmost immediately, or \u201cnaturally,\u201d marked by various\ndrives, particularly the desire for pleasure (which would be akin to\nthe desire for happiness discussed above). On the Freudian view ego\ndevelopment involves the suppression of these various drives (along\nthese lines Horkheimer directly mentions Freud in Eclipse in\ndiscussing the way the child relates to the superego which embodies\nthe principles of father-figures; see p. 75). While the development of\nthe ego is necessary, undue repression of our inner drives leads to\npathological results. In Excursus II of Dialectic, this\nrepression of inner nature is related to Kant\u2019s moral theory,\ninsofar as it specifies that the will should follow reason against\ninclination. This complete denial of inclination by calculating reason\nfinds its fullest expression (in an ironic suggestion that would\nsurely horrify Kant) in the writings of the Marquis de Sade. Pleasure,\nin Sade\u2019s orgies, is submitted to rigorous order, such that the\nrationalized pursuit of pleasure takes precedence over pleasure itself\n(pp. 66\u201369). And importantly in this case it is not only the\ninner desires that are subjugated; others people are subjugated in the\nprocess of subjugating pleasure to organization. This is one instance\nof Horkheimer and Adorno\u2019s broader claim that the domination of\nnature leads to the domination of human beings.\n\nThe same points are made in Eclipse in the chapter \u201cThe\nRevolt of Nature,\u201d where the domination of inner nature is\ndescribed as following necessarily from the domination of outer\nnature. Instrumental reason leads us to dominate outer nature by\ntaking outer nature to be meaningless apart from the way it can\nsatisfy the prerogatives of our self-preservation. But this further\nrequires that our desires must be construed in such a way that they\ncan provide a clear guide for the technological and industrial\nactivity that makes use of outer nature. In this case,\n\u201cdomination becomes \u2018internalized\u2019 for\ndomination\u2019s sake. What is usually indicated as a goal\u2014the\nhappiness of the individual, health, wealth\u2014gains its\nsignificance exclusively from its functional potentiality\u201d (p.\n64). Lohmann 1993 suggestively sums up Horkheimer\u2019s point by\nreferring to the domination of outer and inner nature as a process of\n\u201cdesubstantialization\u201d (p. 392). This connects clearly\nwith the contrast between objective and subjective reason discussed\nabove. Nature loses its objective meaning, or in this sense, its own\n\u201csubstance\u201d; not only in the case of outer nature, but\nalso in the case of inner nature, because of the functionalization of\nour desires and drives. Eclipse construes this in terms of a\nloss of autonomy, which would involve our creatively developing drives\nand desires into ideal ends that could orient the ways we act on our\nenvironments (see, for example, 66). This can make sense of the\nsomewhat unique interpretation in Dialectic of Odysseus\ntelling the cyclops that he is \u201cNobody\u201d (p. 53). As we\nreduce our inner nature to instrumental functions, we lose any strong\nsense of self, and thus lack the inner substance in a manner that\nmakes us, metaphorically, into nobodies.\n",
