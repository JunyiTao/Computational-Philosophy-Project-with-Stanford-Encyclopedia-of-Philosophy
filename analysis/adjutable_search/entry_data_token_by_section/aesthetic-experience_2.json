    "main_text": "Focus of aesthetic experience || Power to Please\n1.2 Power to Please\n\nInfluential medieval philosophers like Augustine (De Musica)\nand Aquinas (Summa Theologica) conceived of beauty as a real\nand objective property inhering in objects themselves\u2014the kind\nof property whose nature does not depend on our capacity to experience\nit. In the eighteenth century, philosophers started to challenge this\nconception of beauty. Many posited a deeper metaphysical dependence\nbetween our capacity to have certain feelings and the properties on\nwhich those very experiences are focused: they took these properties\njust to be powers to produce certain pleasurable responses in us (cf.\nShelley 2010 on \u201cempiricism\u201d and de Clercq 2013 on\n\u201cexperiential accounts\u201d).\n\nAs James Shelley (\u201c18th Century British\nAesthetics\u201d) has pointed out, these views treat beauty as a\nLockean (1689) secondary quality (\u201cnothing in the objects\nthemselves, but powers to produce various sensations in us by their\nprimary qualities,\u201d Book I, Ch.VIII, \u00a710). Accordingly, the\nBritish empiricists tended to endorse such views of beauty and\nsublimity. Addison (1712 [1879]) drew the connection with \u201cMr.\nLock\u201d directly (letter no.413). Hutcheson (1726 [2004]) said\nbeauty was a capacity to \u201cexcite\u201d a certain type of\npleasure. Edmund Burke (1756 [2007]) called beauty \u201csome quality\nin bodies, acting mechanically upon the human mind by the intervention\nof the senses\u201d (in Cahn and Meskin 2007, p. 119). In his\nTreatise (1739\u201340 [1987]), David Hume called beauty as\n\u201cnothing but a form, which produces pleasure\u201d\n(II.1.8.2).\n\nThe empiricists and those they influenced gave similar treatments of\nthe sublime, another kind of feature typically introduced as a focus\nof aesthetic experience (contrast Kant 1789 [1987]; see following\nsection). Here the emphasis is less on a power to produce a certain\nfrisson of feeling, and more on the power to inspire a certain kind of\nmental activity, especially of the imagination. Joseph Addison (1712\n[1879]) treated \u201cGreatness\u201d as a \u201crude kind of\nMagnificence\u201d that offers our faculty of imagination the\npleasure of grasping at something it cannot capture in full (letter\nno.412). Burke (1756 [2007]), often cited as the originator of the\nidea of the sublime in Anglophone philosophy, considered the sublime\nto be that which would otherwise be painful and terrifying to behold,\nbut which is so distanced as to modify these feelings \u201cas not to\nbe actually noxious \u2026 [but] capable of producing delight\u201d\n(\u00a7VII). Influenced by reading Burke, Mendelssohn (1758 [1997])\ndefined the sublime as something that \u201ccaptures our attention\n\u2026 [and] arouses a sweet shudder that rushes through every fiber\nof our being\u2026 giving wings to the imagination to press further\nand further without stopping\u201d (pp. 196\u20137).\n\nSince these philosophers took aesthetic experience to focus on beauty\nand sublimity, and took these features to be powers to produce certain\nkinds of pleasurable mental responses, they thereby took aesthetic\nexperience to be experience of such powers to please. There need be\nnothing particularly troubling about the idea that you can experience\nan object\u2019s power to please in perception; this power can be\nexperienced precisely by being so pleased in such perception.\n\nThe view of beauty or sublimity as powers sometimes led the\nempiricists to deny that beauty or sublimity was really a feature of\nobjects themselves (Hutcheson 1726 [2004], Hume 1739\u201340 [1987]).\nThis was a substantive confusion, and was effectively called out as\nsuch by Thomas Reid. Reid (1785 [1969]) charged Hutcheson with\n\u201can abuse of words\u201d (p.782): it cannot be right to say\nthat beauty \u201cproperty denotes the Perception of some\nMind,\u201d since we talk of objects as having the property\nof beauty (Hutcheson 1726 [2004], p. 27). Contemporary commentators\nagree that there isn\u2019t anything suspect about an object\u2019s\ngenuinely having a property that is a power to produce certain mental\nresponses (Moran 2012; Sibley 1968). This worry has fallen away from\ncontemporary views that take beauty, sublimity, or aesthetic value to\nbe a matter of having a power to please\u2014and aesthetic experience\nto be experience of that power (e.g. Matthen 2017a, 2017b, 2018).\n\nThere are two serious issues for those views which take aesthetic\nexperience to be solely focused in on its object\u2019s powers to\nproduce certain responses in us.\n\nHere\u2019s the first issue. If the beauty, sublimity, or other\naesthetic value of an object O is just a power to produce\ncertain responses in us, and aesthetic experience is just a certain\nappreciation of such a power\u2014even one that involves actually\nhaving such a response\u2014then anything that has the power to\nproduce such a response in us should have the same beauty, sublimity,\nor other aesthetic value as O. But we do not typically take\nbeauty, sublimity, or aesthetic value to be so cleanly separable from\nits bearer. Many think that an aesthetic experience of\nO\u2019s properties is one that captures something utterly\nindividual in O, undetachable from the object it is (cf.\nSections 1.4.4 and 2.6). But any characterization of the kind of\nmental response which O has a power to produce, and which\nconstitutes O\u2019s beauty, sublimity, or aesthetic value,\nwill simply offer an (in principle) way to get the same aesthetic\nexperience elsewhere\u2014e.g. by appreciating a perfect forgery, or\na hallucinated object. This might seem unacceptable.\n\nThere are a couple of possible responses to this issue. Some (Budd\n1985; Davies 1994; Levinson 1996) simply deny that you really could\nhave the relevant type of experience in the absence of the relevant\nspecial object (cf. Shelley 2010). Another response is simply to\naccept that the relevant aesthetic experience and aesthetic value can\nbe had elsewhere, and to explain away intuitions that this should not\nbe possible (Peacocke 2021).\n\nThe second problem is harder to dismiss, and it calls for a more\nfundamental reorientation towards the focus of aesthetic experience.\nIt takes very little for an object to have a mere power to\nplease, even a power to please via perception of its features. If all\nit took for an object to be beautiful or sublime was for it to have\nsome such power, we should take individual experiences of such\npowers\u2014individual instances of being so pleased\u2014to be\ndemonstrative of such aesthetic value in objects. But we typically do\nnot take reports of such experience to be so demonstrative. Instead,\nthe pleasure an individual takes in an object is usually taken to be\ncontestably relevant to its aesthetic value. Whether that pleasure\nattests to an object\u2019s power to please is beyond dispute, but\nwhether it attests to an object\u2019s beauty, sublimity, or\naesthetic value is often disputed.\n\nThis fact troubled Hume in his later writing on aesthetics. In his\nseminal essay \u201cOf the standard of taste,\u201d Hume (1757\n[1987a]) subtly amended his Treatise\u2019s (1739\u201340\n[1987]) view of beauty (cf. Nehamas 1981, Cavell 1965 [2007]). What is\n\u201cfitted by nature to produce those particular feelings\u201d of\npleasurable liking, and thus is in a sense genuinely beautiful, is\nthat which draws univocal and lasting approval from \u201ctrue\njudges\u201d\u2014ideally sensitive, practiced, and unprejudiced\ncritics of the arts. This view of beauty still entangles it\nconstitutively with experience, but with a crucially idealized\nrestriction (cf. De Clercq 2013 on \u201cresponse dependent\nproperties\u201d at p. 305). This restriction anticipates, but does\nnot itself yet reach, a more fundamental shift in approach to the\nfocus of aesthetic value brought about by Kant: an approach that takes\naesthetic experience to involve an attribution of a merited\nresponse.\n",
