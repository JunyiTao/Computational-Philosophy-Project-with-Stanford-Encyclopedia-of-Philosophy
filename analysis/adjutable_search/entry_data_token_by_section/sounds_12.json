    "main_text": "Aspatial Theories || Aspatial Sounds\n4.1 Aspatial Sounds\n\nWe have seen the use of phenomenological arguments against both medial\nand proximal theories of sound. To sum them up, one may claim that,\nfirst, auditory experience has a spatial content whereby sounds seem\nto be located in egocentric space (to the left, above, in front of us,\netc.). Second, unless one subscribes to an error theory of auditory\nexperience, sounds are where they are (normally) heard to be, namely\nat their sources.\n\nBefore presenting a-spatial theories, let us conclude the discussion\non the spatial theories of sound by adding that they all share the\nassumptions that reflections on the spatiality of audition are crucial\nin order to tackle issues on the metaphysics of sound\u2014that is,\nwe can say what sounds are when we know where they\nare located (Di Bona 2019). Moreover, considerations on the spatiality\nof audition and sounds are also important to understand the\nsegregation of auditory streams\u2014which constitute the auditory\nlandscape\u2014and the experience of some musical compositions\n(2019). Finally\u2014despite the remarkable difference between the\nspatiality of vision and the spatiality of audition due to the fact\nthat, in audition, we perceive where sources are, the space between us\nand the sources (O\u2019Callaghan 2010b) and the space between the\nsources, whereas, in vision, we perceive also where objects are\npotentially to be seen (Nudds 2009)\u2014spatial cues can also enter\nthe auditory content and provide info on the volume of empty space,\nespecially when derived from reverberations produced in a specific\nclosed space (Young 2017).\n But are sounds really located in space? There is in the literature\na strong non-locational view of sounds. Strawson has made the\nplausibility of a thought-experiment of a purely auditory world rest\nupon the tenet of an intrinsic non-spatiality of sounds. (Philosophers\nand psychologists such as Lotze (1841 [1884: Ch. 6, 123\u20136]),\nBinet (1905: Ch. 3), Heymans (1911 [1905]: Ch. 1), Stumpf (1883\u20131890: Vol. 1,\n29), Wellek (1934), R\u00e9v\u00e9sz (1946), Ihde (1976: Ch. 6),\nEvans (1980 [1986: 248 ff.]), have investigated the phenomenology of\nauditory space and suggested the possibility of a purely auditory\nworld.) Strawson (1959: 65\u201366) thus wrote: \n\n\nSounds\u2026have no intrinsic spatial characteristics: such\nexpressions as \u201cto the left of\u201d, \u201cspatially\nabove\u201d, \u201cnearer\u201d, \u201cfarther\u201d have no\nintrinsically auditory significance (\u2026). A purely auditory\nconcept of space\u2026is an impossibility. The fact that, with the\nvariegated types of sense-experience which we in fact have, we can, as\nwe say, \u201con the strength of hearing alone\u201d assign\ndirections and distances to sounds, and things that emit or cause\nthem, counts against this not at all. For this fact is sufficiently\nexplained by the existence of correlations between the variations of\nwhich sound is intrinsically capable and other non-auditory features\nof sense-experience.\n\n\nStrawson designed his thought-experiment in the context of an analysis\nof the Kantian claim that the notion of there being objective entities\n(entities which do not depend on our perception of them) involves the\nnotion of space: \n\n\n[t]he question we are to consider, then, is this: Could a being whose\nexperience was purely auditory have a conceptual scheme which provided\nfor objective particulars? (Strawson 1959: 66) \n\n\nThus, he imagined a character (later on called \u201cHero\u201d by\nEvans 1980) who has only non-spatial auditory experiences. Hero\nperceives sounds, but he does not perceive them to be located in\nphysical space. What Strawson tried to show is that Hero needs an\n\u201canalogue\u201d to the notion of space in order to\n\u201clocate\u201d sounds when they are not actually heard. This\nanalogue is provided by what Strawson calls a\n\u201cmaster-sound\u201d, namely a constant sound varying in pitch.\nAny particular sound is heard against the background of the\nmaster-sound. Thanks to the master-sound, Hero can distinguish between\nexperiencing the same particular sound again (when its\n\u201clocation\u201d as provided by the master-sound is the same),\nand experiencing successively two particular sounds of the same type\n(when they have different \u201clocations\u201d on the master-sound\nmap). Evans (1980) questioned the claim that the master-sound could\nplay the role of physical space in grounding the notion of objective\nparticulars; see also Strawson\u2019s (1980) reply to Evans.\n\nIn evaluating Strawson\u2019s thought-experiment, we should\ndistinguish the claim that there can be non-spatial auditory\nexperiences from the claim that there can be a world populated only\nwith sounds. Strawson\u2019s thought-experiment justifies the former\nclaim, but it does not obviously lead to the latter. One cannot infer\nfrom the fact that we can perceptually represent a sound without\nrepresenting its location, that we can perceptually represent a\nnon-located sound.\n",
