    "main_text": "Frege\u2019s Theorem\n5. Frege\u2019s Theorem\n\nFrege\u2019s Theorem is that the five Dedekind/Peano axioms for\nnumber theory can be derived from Hume\u2019s Principle in\nsecond-order logic. In this section, we reconstruct the proof of this\ntheorem; it can be extracted from Frege\u2019s work using the\ndefinitions and theorems assembled so far. Some of the steps in this\nproof can be found in Gl. (See the Appendix to Boolos\n1990 for a reconstruction.) Our reconstruction follows Frege\u2019s\nGg in spirit and in most details, but we have tried\nto simplify the presentation in several places. For a stricter\ndescription of Frege\u2019s Gg proof, the reader is\nreferred to Heck 1993. The following should help prepare the reader\nfor Heck\u2019s excellent essay.\n5.1 Zero is a Natural Number\n\nThe statement that zero is a natural number is an immediate\nconsequence of the definition of natural number:\n\nTheorem 1:\n\n\\(N0\\) \n\nProof: It is a simple consequence of the definition of\n\u2018weak ancestral\u2019 that \\(R^{+}\\) is reflexive (see Fact 4\nabout \\(R^{+}\\) in our subsection on the Weak Ancestral in \u00a74).\nSo \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,0)\\). Hence, by the definition of natural\nnumber, \\(0\\) is a natural number.\n\nIt seems that Frege never actually identified this fact explicitly in\nGl or labeled this fact as a numbered Theorem in\nGg I.\n5.2 Zero Isn\u2019t the Successor of Any Natural Number\n\nIt is also a simple consequence of the foregoing that 0 doesn\u2019t\nsucceed any natural number. This can be represented formally as\nfollows: \n\nTheorem 2:\n\n\\(\\neg\\exists x(Nx \\amp \\mathit{Precedes}(x,0))\\)\n\nProof: Assume, for reductio, that some number, say\n\\(n\\), is such that \\(\\mathit{Precedes}(n,0)\\). Then, by the\ndefinition of predecessor, it follows that there is a concept, say\n\\(Q\\) and an object, say \\(c\\), such that \\(Qc \\amp 0\\eqclose \\#Q \\amp\nn\\eqclose \\#[\\lambda z\\, Qz \\amp z\\neq c]\\). But by the Lemma\nConcerning Zero (above), \\(0 = \\#Q\\) implies \\(\\neg\\exists xQx\\),\nwhich contradicts the fact that \\(Qc\\).\n\nSee Gl, \u00a778, Item (6); and Gg\nI, \u00a7109, Theorem 126.\n5.3 No Two Natural Numbers Have the Same Successor\n\nThe fact that no two natural numbers have the same successor is\nsomewhat more difficult to prove (cf. Gl, \u00a778,\nItem (5); Gg I, \u00a795, Theorem 89). We may\nformulate this theorem as follows, with \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(o\\) as\nrestricted variables ranging over the natural numbers: \n\nTheorem 3:\n\n\\(\\forall m\\forall n\\forall o[\\mathit{Precedes}(m,o)\\amp\n\\mathit{Precedes}(n,o) \\to m = n]\\) \n\nIn other words, this theorem asserts that predecessor is a one-to-one\nrelation on the natural numbers. To prove this theorem, it suffices to\nprove that predecessor is a one-to-one relation full stop. One can\nprove that predecessor is one-to-one from Hume\u2019s Principle, with\nthe help of the following Equinumerosity Lemma, the proof of which is\nrather long and involved. The Equinumerosity Lemma asserts that when\n\\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are equinumerous, \\(x\\) falls under \\(F\\), and \\( y\\)\nfalls under \\(G\\), then the concept object falling under F other\nthan x is equinumerous to the concept object falling under G\nother than \\(y\\). The picture is something like this: \n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nIn terms of Figure 3, the Equinumerosity Lemma tells us that if there\nis a relation \\(R\\) which is a witness to the equinumerosity of \\( F\\)\nand \\(G\\), then there is a relation \\(R'\\) which is a witness to the\nequinumerosity of the concepts that result when you restrict \\( F\\)\nand \\(G\\) to the objects other than \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively.\n\n\nTo help us formalize the Equinumerosity Lemma, let \\(F^{-x}\\)\nabbreviate the concept \\([\\lambda z \\, Fz \\amp z\\neq x]\\) and let\n\\(G^{-y}\\) abbreviate the concept \\( [\\lambda z \\, Gz \\amp z \\neq\ny]\\). Then we have:\n\nEquinumerosity Lemma:\n\n\\(F\\apprxclose G \\amp Fx \\amp Gy \\to F^{-x}\\apprxclose G^{-y}\\) \n\n (Proof of Equinumerosity Lemma)\n\nNow we can prove that Predecessor is a one-to-one relation from this\nLemma and Hume\u2019s Principle (cf. Gg I,\n\u00a7108): \n\n\nPredecessor is One-to-One:\n\n\\(\\forall x\\forall y\\forall z[\\mathit{Precedes}(x,z) \\amp\n\\mathit{Precedes}(y,z) \\to x\\eqclose y] \\) \n\nProof: Assume that both a and b are precedessors of \\(c\\). By\nthe definition of predecessor, we know that there are concepts and\nobjects \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(d\\), and \\(e\\), such that:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n& Pd \\amp c\\eqclose \\#P \\amp a\\eqclose \\#P^{-d} \\\\\n& Qe \\amp c\\eqclose \\#Q \\amp b\\eqclose \\#Q^{-e} \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nBut if both \\(c = \\#P\\) and \\(c = \\#Q\\), then \\(\\#P = \\#Q\\). So, by\nHume\u2019s Principle, \\(P \\approx Q\\). So, by the Equinumerosity\nLemma, it follows that \\(P^{-d} \\approx Q^{-e}\\). If so, then by\nHume\u2019s Principle, \\(\\#P^{-d} = \\#Q^{-e}\\). But then, \\(a =\nb\\).\n\n\nSo, if Predecessor is a one-to-one relation, it is a one-to-one\nrelation on the natural numbers. Therefore, no two numbers have the\nsame successor. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.\n\nIt is important to mention here that not only is Predecessor a\none-to-one relation, it is also a functional relation:\n\nPredecessor is a Functional Relation:\n\n\\(\\forall x\\forall y\\forall z[\\mathit{Precedes}(x,y)\\amp\n\\mathit{Precedes}(x,z)\\to y\\eqclose z]\\) \n\nThis fact can be proved with the help of a kind of converse to the\nEquinumerosity Lemma: \n\nEquinumerosity Lemma \u2018Converse\u2019:\n\n\\(F^{-x}\\apprxclose G^{-y} \\amp Fx \\amp Gy \\towide F\\apprxclose G\\)\n\n\nWe leave the proof of the Equinumerosity Lemma \u2018Converse\u2019\nand the proof of Predecessor is a Functional Relation as exercises for\nthe reader.\n5.4 The Principle of Mathematical Induction\n\nLet us say that a concept \\(F\\) is hereditary on the natural\nnumbers just in case every \u2018adjacent\u2019 pair of numbers\n\\(n\\) and \\(m\\) (\\(n\\) preceding \\(m\\)) is such that \\(m\\) falls under\n\\(F\\) whenever \\(n\\) falls under \\(F\\), i.e.,\n\n\\(\\mathit{HerOn}(F,N) \\eqabbr \\forall n\\forall\nm[\\mathit{Precedes}(n,m)\\to (Fn \\to Fm)]\\) \n\nThen we may state the Principle of Mathematical Induction as follows:\nif (a) \\(0\\) falls under \\(F\\) and (b) \\(F\\) is hereditary on the\nnatural numbers, then every natural number falls under \\(F\\). In\nformal terms:\n\nTheorem 4: Principle of Mathematical\nInduction:\n\n\\(F0 \\amp \\mathit{HerOn}(F,N) \\to \\forall n Fn\\) \n\nFrege actually proves the Principle of Mathematical Induction from a\nmore general principle that governs any \\(R\\)-series whatsoever. We\nwill call the latter the General Principle of Induction. It asserts\nthat whenever a falls under \\(F\\), and \\(F\\) is hereditary on the\n\\(R\\)-series beginning with \\(a\\), then every member of that\n\\(R\\)-series falls under \\(F\\). We can formalize the General Principle\nof Induction with the help of a strict understanding of\n\u2018hereditary on the \\(R\\)-series beginning with \\(a\\)\u2019.\nHere is a definition:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n&\\mathit{HerOn}(F, {}^{a}R^{+}) \\eqabbr  \\\\\n&\\quad \\forall x\\forall y[R^{+}(a,x)\\amp R^{+}(a,y) \\amp Rxy \\towide (Fx \\to Fy)]\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nIn other words, \\(F\\) is hereditary on the members of the \\(R\\)-series\nbeginning with \\(a\\) just in case every adjacent pair \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nin this series (with \\(x\\) bearing \\(R\\) to \\(y\\)) is such that \\(y\\)\nfalls under \\(F\\) whenever \\(x\\) falls under \\(F\\). Now given this\ndefinition, we can reformulate the General Principle of Induction more\nstrictly as: \n\nGeneral Principle of Induction:\n\n\\([Fa \\amp \\mathit{HerOn}(F, {}^{a}R^{+})] ~\\to~ \\forall x[R^{+}(a,x)\n\\to Fx]\\) \n\nThis is a version of Frege\u2019s Theorem 152 in Gg\nI, \u00a7117.\n\nWe may sketch the proof strategy as follows. Assume that the\nantecedent of the General Principle of Induction holds for an\narbitrarily chosen concept, say \\(P\\). That is, assume:\n\n\\(Pa \\amp \\mathit{HerOn}(P, {}^{a}R^{+})\\) \n\nNow to show \\(\\forall x(R^{+}(a,x) \\to Px)\\), pick an arbitrary\nobject, say \\(b\\), and further assume \\(R^{+}(a,b)\\). We then simply\nhave to show \\(Pb\\). We do this by invoking Fact (7) about \\(R^{+}\\)\n(in our subsection on the Weak Ancestral in \u00a74). Recall that Fact\n(7) is: \n\n\\([Fx \\amp R^{+}(x,y) \\amp \\mathit{Her}(F,R)] \\to Fy\\) \n\nThis is a theorem of logic containing the free variables \\(x\\), \\(y\\),\nand \\(F\\). First, we instantiate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\),\nrespectively. Then, we instantiate \\(F\\) to the concept \\([\\lambda z\n\\, R^{+}(a,z) \\amp Pz]\\) and apply \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion (though\nFrege could simply use his Rule of Substitution to achieve the same\ninference). The concept being instantiated for \\(F\\) is the concept\nmember of the R-series beginning with a and which falls under\nP. The result of instantiating the free variables in Fact (7) and\nthen applying \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion yields a rather long conditional,\nwith numerous conjuncts in the antecedent and the claim that \\(Pb\\) in\nthe consequent. Thus, if the antecedent can be established, the proof\nis done. For those following along with pencil and paper, all of the\nconjuncts in the antecedent are things we already know, with the\nexception of the claim that \\([\\lambda z \\, R^{+}(a,z)\\amp Pz]\\) is\nhereditary on \\(R\\). However, this claim can be established\nstraightforwardly from things we know to be true (and, in particular,\nfrom facts contained in the antecedent of the Principle we are trying\nto prove, which we assumed as part of our conditional proof). The\nreader is encouraged to complete the proof as an exercise. For those\nwho would like to check their work, we give the complete Proof of the\nGeneral Principle of Induction here: \n\nProof of the General Principle of Induction\n\n\nNow to derive Principle of Mathematical Induction from the General\nPrinciple of Induction, we formulate an instance of the latter by\nsetting \\(a\\) to \\(0\\) and \\(R\\) to Precedes:\n\n\\({[}F0 \\amp \\mathit{HerOn}(F, {}^{0}\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}){]} \\towide\n\\forall x{[}\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,x) \\to Fx{]}\\) \n\nWhen we expand the defined notation for \\(\\mathit{HerOn}\\), substitute\nthe notation \\(Nx\\) and \\(Ny\\) for \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,x)\\) and\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,y)\\), respectively, and then employ our\nrestricted quantifiers \\(\\forall n(\\ldots n\\ldots)\\) and \\(\\forall\nm(\\ldots m\\ldots)\\) for the claims of the form \\(\\forall y(Ny \\to\n\\ldots y\\ldots)\\) and \\(\\forall x(Nx \\to \\ldots x\\ldots)\\),\nrespectively, the result is the Principle of Mathematical Induction\n(in which the notation \\(\\mathit{HerOn}(F,N)\\) has been eliminated in\nterms of its definiens). \n5.5 Every Natural Number Has a Successor\n\nFrege uses the Principle of Mathematical Induction to prove that every\nnatural number has a successor that\u2019s a natural number. We may\nformulate the theorem as follows:\n\nTheorem 5:\n\n\\(\\forall x{[}Nx \\to \\exists y(Ny \\amp \\mathit{Precedes}(x,y)){]}\\)\n\n\nTo reconstruct Frege\u2019s strategy for proving this theorem, recall\nthat the weak ancestral of the Predecessor relation, i.e.,\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(x,y)\\), can be read as: \\(x\\) is a member of\nthe predecessor-series ending with \\(y\\). Frege then considers the\nconcept member of the predecessor-series ending with n, i.e.,\n\\([\\lambda z \\, \\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,n)]\\), where \\(n\\) is a\nnatural number. Frege then shows, by induction, that every natural\nnumber \\(n\\) precedes the number of the concept member of the\npredecessor-series ending with n. That is, Frege proves that\nevery natural number has a successor by proving the following Lemma on\nSuccessors by induction:\n\nLemma on Successors:\n\n\\(\\forall n \\mathit{Precedes}(n,\\#[\\lambda z \\,\n\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,n)])\\) \n\nThis asserts that every natural number \\(n\\) precedes the number of\nnumbers in the predecessor series ending with \\(n\\). Frege can\nestablish Theorem 5 by proving the Lemma on Successors and by showing\nthat the successor of a natural number is itself a natural number.\n\nTo see an intuitive picture of why the Lemma on Successors gives us\nwhat we want, we may temporarily regard \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}\\) as\nthe relation \u2264. (One can prove that \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}\\) has\nthe properties that \u2264 has on the natural numbers.) Although we\nhaven\u2019t yet assigned any meaning to the numerals \u20181\u2019\nand \u20182\u2019, the following intuitive sequence is driving\nFrege\u2019s strategy:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n&0 \\text{ precedes } \\#[\\lambda z \\, z \\leq 0] \\\\\n&1 \\text{ precedes } \\#[\\lambda z \\, z \\leq 1] \\\\\n&2 \\text{ precedes } \\#[\\lambda z \\, z \\leq 2] \\\\\n&\\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nFor example, the third member of this sequence is true because there\nare 3 natural numbers (0, 1, and 2) that are less than or equal to 2;\nso the number 2 precedes the number of numbers less than or equal to\n2. Frege\u2019s strategy is to show that the general claim, that\n\\(n\\) precedes the number of numbers less than or equal to \\(n\\),\nholds for every natural number. So, given this intuitive understanding\nof the Lemma on Successors, Frege has a good strategy for proving that\nevery number has a successor. (For the remainder of this subsection,\nthe reader may wish to continue to think of \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}\\)\nin terms of \\(\\leq\\).)\n\nNow to prove the Lemma on Successors by induction, we need to\nreconfigure this Lemma to a form which can be used as the consequent\nof the Principle of Mathematical Induction; i.e., we need something of\nthe form \\(\\forall n\\, Fn\\). We can get the Lemma on Successors into\nthis form by \u2018abstracting out\u2019 a concept from the Lemma\nusing the right-to-left direction of \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion (i.e.,\n\\(\\lambda\\)-Abstraction) to produce the following equivalent statement\nof the Lemma:\n\n\\(\\forall n [\\lambda y \\, \\mathit{Precedes}(y, \\#[\\lambda z \\,\n\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,y)])]n\\) \n\nThe concept \u2018abstracted out\u2019 is the following:\n\n\\([\\lambda y\\, \\mathit{Precedes}(y,\\#[\\lambda z \\,\n\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,y)])]\\) \n\nThis is the concept: being an object \\(y\\) which precedes\nthe number of the concept: member of the predecessor series ending\nin \\(y\\). Let us abbreviate the \\(\\lambda\\)-expression that\ndenotes this concept as \u2018\\(Q\\)\u2019. Our strategy is to\ninstantiate the variable \\(F\\) in the Principle of Mathematical\nInduction to \\(Q\\). The result is therefore something that has been\nproved and that we therefore know to be true: \n\n\\(Q0 \\amp \\mathit{HerOn}(Q,N) \\to \\forall nQn\\) \n\nSince the consequent is the reconfigured Lemma on Successors, Frege\ncan prove this Lemma by proving both that \\(0\\) falls under \\(Q\\) (cf.\nGg I, Theorem 154) and that \\(Q\\) is hereditary on\nthe natural numbers (cf. Gg I, Theorem 150): \n\nProof that \\(0\\) falls under \\(Q\\)\n\n\nProof that \\(Q\\) is hereditary on the natural numbers\n\n\nGiven this proof of the Lemma on Successors, Theorem 5 is not far\naway. The Lemma on Successors shows that every number precedes some\ncardinal number of the form \\(\\#F\\). We still have to show that such\nsuccessor cardinals are natural numbers. That is, it still remains to\nbe shown that if a number \\(n\\) precedes something \\(y\\), then \\(y\\)\nis a natural number: \n\nSuccessors of Natural Numbers are Natural Numbers:\n\n\\(\\forall n\\forall y (\\mathit{Precedes}(n,y) \\to Ny)\\)\n\nProof: Suppose that \\(\\mathit{Precedes}(n,a)\\). Then, by\ndefinition, since \\(n\\) is a natural number,\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,n)\\). So by Fact (3) about \\(R^{+}\\) (in the\nsubsection on the Weak Ancestral in \u00a74), it follows that\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^*(0,a)\\), and so by the definition of\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}\\), it follows that\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,a)\\); i.e., \\(a\\) is a natural number.\n\nTheorem 5 now follows from the Lemma on Successors and the fact that\nsuccessors of natural numbers are natural numbers. With the proof of\nTheorem 5, we have completed the proof of Frege\u2019s Theorem.\nBefore we turn to the last section of this entry, it is worth\nmentioning the mathematical significance of this theorem. \n5.6 Arithmetic\n\nFrom Frege\u2019s Theorem, one can derive arithmetic. It is an\nimmediate consequence Theorem 5 and the fact that Predecessor is a\nfunctional relation that every number has a unique successor.\nThat means we can define the successor function by adding definite\ndescriptions of the form \u2018the \\(x\\) such that \\(\\phi\\)\u2019 to\nour language:\n\n\\(n' \\eqdef\\) the \\(x\\) such that \\(\\mathit{Precedes}(n,x)\\) \n\nWe may then define the sequence of natural numbers succeeding \\(0\\) as\nfollows:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n&1 = 0' \\\\\n&2 = 1' \\\\\n&3 = 2' \\\\\n&\\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nMoreover, the recursive definition of addition can now be given: \n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n&n + 0 = n \\\\\n&n + m' = (n + m)'\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nWe may also officially define:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n&n \\lt  m \\eqdef \\mathit{Precedes}^*(n,m) \\\\\n&n \\le m \\eqdef \\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(n,m)\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nThese definitions constitute the foundations of arithmetic. Frege has\nthus insightfully derived the basic laws of arithmetic from\nHume\u2019s Principle in second-order logic. (Readers interested in\nhow these results are affected when Hume\u2019s Principle is combined\nwith predicative second-order logic should consult Linnebo\n2004.)\n6. Philosophical Questions Surrounding Frege\u2019s Theorem\n\nAs we\u2019ve now seen, the proof of Frege\u2019s Theorem can be carried\nout independently of the portion of Frege\u2019s system which led to\ninconsistency. Frege himself never identified \u201cFrege\u2019s\nTheorem\u201d as a \u201cresult\u201d. As previously noted, he\nattempted to derive Hume\u2019s Principle from Basic Law V in\nGg, but once the contradiction became known to him,\nhe never officially retreated to the \u2018fall-back\u2019 position\nof claiming that the proof of the Dedekind-Peano axioms from\nHume\u2019s Principle alone constituted an important result. One of\nseveral reasons why he didn\u2019t adopt this fall-back position is\nthat he didn\u2019t regard Hume\u2019s Principle as a sufficiently\ngeneral principle \u2013 he didn\u2019t believe it was strong\nenough, from an epistemological point of view, to help us answer the\nquestion, \u201cHow are numbers given to us?\u201d. We discuss the\nthinking behind this attitude, and other things, in what follows.\n\nA discussion of the philosophical questions surrounding Frege\u2019s\nTheorem should begin with some statement of how Frege conceived of his\nown project when writing Begr, Gl,\nand Gg. It seems clear that epistemological\nconsiderations in part motivated Frege\u2019s work on the foundations\nof mathematics. It is well documented that Frege had the following\ngoal, namely, to explain our knowledge of the basic laws of arithmetic\nby giving an answer to the question \u201cHow are numbers\n\u2018given\u2019 to us?\u201d without making an appeal to the\nfaculty of intuition. If Frege could show that the basic laws of\nnumber theory are derivable from analytic truths of logic, then he\ncould argue that we need only appeal to the faculty of understanding\n(as opposed to some faculty of intuition) to explain our knowledge of\nthe truths of arithmetic. Frege\u2019s goal then stands in contrast\nto the Kantian view of the exact mathematical sciences, according to\nwhich general principles of reasoning must be supplemented by a\nfaculty of intuition if we are to achieve mathematical knowledge. The\nKantian model here is that of geometry; Kant thought that our\nintuitions of figures and constructions played an essential role in\nthe demonstrations of geometrical theorems. (In Frege\u2019s own\ntime, the achievements of Frege\u2019s contemporaries Pasch (1882),\nPeano (1889b), Pieri (1898), and Hilbert (1899) showed that such\nintuitions were not essential.)\n6.1 Frege\u2019s Goals and Strategy in His Own Words\n\nFrege\u2019s strategy then was to show that no appeal to intuition is\nrequired for the derivation of the theorems of number theory. This in\nturn required that he show that the latter are derivable using only\nrules of inference, axioms, and definitions that are purely analytic\nprinciples of logic. This view has become known as\n\u2018Logicism\u2019. Here is what Frege says: \n\n\n[Begr, Preface, p. 5:]\n\nTo prevent anything intuitive from penetrating here unnoticed, I had\nto bend every effort to keep the chain of inferences free of gaps.\n[from the Bauer-Mengelberg translation in van Heijenoort 1967]\n\n[Begr, Part III, \u00a723:]\n\nThrough the present example, moreover, we see how pure thought,\nirrespective of any content given by the senses or even by an\nintuition a priori, can, solely from the content that results\nfrom its own constitution, bring forth judgements that at first sight\nappear to be possible only on the basis of some intuition. \\(\\ldots\\)\nThe propositions about sequences [\\(R\\)-series] in what follows far\nsurpass in generality all those that can be derived from any intuition\nof sequences. [from the Bauer-Mengelberg translation in van Heijenoort\n1967]\n\n[Gl, \u00a762:]\n\nHow, then, are numbers to be given to us, if we cannot have any ideas\nor intuitions of them? Since it is only in the context of a\nproposition that words have any meaning, our problem becomes this: To\ndefine the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs. [from\nthe Austin translation in Frege 1953]\n\n[Gl, \u00a787:]\n\nI hope I may claim in the present work to have made it probable that\nthe laws of arithmetic are analytic judgements and consequently a\npriori. Arithmetic thus becomes simply a development of logic, and\nevery proposition of arithmetic a law of logic, albeit a derivative\none. [from the Austin translation in Frege 1953]\n\n[Gg I, \u00a70:]\n\nIn my Grundlagen der Arithmetik, I sought to make it\nplausible that arithmetic is a branch of logic and need not borrow any\nground of proof whatever from either experience or intuition. In the\npresent book, this shall be confirmed, by the derivation of the\nsimplest laws of Numbers by logical means alone. [from the Furth\ntranslation in Frege 1967]\n\n[Gg II, Appendix:]\n\nThe prime problem of arithmetic is the question, In what way are we to\nconceive logical objects, in particular, numbers? By what means are we\njustified in recognizing numbers as objects? Even if this problem is\nnot solved to the degree I thought it was when I wrote this volume,\nstill I do not doubt that the way to the solution has been found.\n[from the Furth translation in Frege 1967]\n\n6.2 The Basic Problem for Frege\u2019s Strategy\n\nThe basic problem for Frege\u2019s strategy, however, is that for his\nlogicist project to succeed, his system must at some point include\n(either as an axiom or theorem) statements that explicitly assert the\nexistence of certain kinds of abstract entities and it is not obvious\nhow to justify the claim that we know such explicit existential\nstatements. Given the above discussion, it should be clear that Frege\nat some point in Gg endorsed existence claims, either directly\nin his formalism or in his metalanguage, for the following entities:\n\n\nconcepts (more generally, functions)\nextensions (more generally, courses-of-value or value-ranges)\ntruth-values\nnumbers\n\n\nAlthough Frege attempted to reduce the latter two kinds of entities\n(truth-values and numbers) to extensions, the fact is that the\nexistence of concepts and extensions are derivable from his Rule of\nSubstitution and Basic Law V, respectively.\n\nIn light of these existence claims, a Kantian might well suggest not\nonly that explicit existence claims are synthetic rather than analytic\n(i.e., aren\u2019t true in virtue of the meanings of the words\ninvolved) but also that since the Rule of Substitution and Basic Law V\nimply existence claims, Frege cannot claim that such principles are\npurely analytic principles of logic. If the Kantian is right, then\nsome other faculty (such as intuition) might still be needed to\naccount for our knowledge of the existence claims of arithmetic.\n6.3 The Existence of Concepts\n\nBoolos (1985) noted that the Rule of Substitution causes a problem of\nthis kind for Frege\u2019s program given that it is equivalent the\nComprehension Principle for Concepts. Boolos suggests a defense for\nFrege with respect to this particular aspect of his logic, namely, to\nreinterpret (by paraphrasing) the second-order quantifiers so as to\navoid commitment to concepts. (See Boolos (1985) for the details.)\nBoolos\u2019s suggestion, however, is one which would require Frege\nto abandon his realist theory of concepts. Moreover, although\nBoolos\u2019s suggestion might lead us to an epistemological\njustification of the Comprehension Principle for Concepts, it\ndoesn\u2019t do the same for the Comprehension Principle for\nRelations, for his reinterpretation of the quantifiers works only for\nthe \u2018monadic\u2019 quantifiers (i.e., those ranging over\nconcepts having one argument) and thus doesn\u2019t offer a\nparaphrase for quantification over relational concepts.\n\nAnother problem for a strategy of the type suggested by Boolos is that\nif the second-order quantifiers are interpreted so that they do not\nrange over a separate domain of entities, then there is nothing\nappropriate to serve as the denotations of \\(\\lambda\\)-expressions.\nAlthough Frege wouldn\u2019t quite put it this way, our\nreconstruction suggests that Frege treats open formulas with free\nobject variables as if they denoted concepts. Although Frege\ndoesn\u2019t use \\(\\lambda\\)-notation, the use of such notation seems\nto be the most logically perspicuous way of reconstructing his work.\nThe use of such notation faces the same epistemological puzzles that\nFrege\u2019s Rule of Substitution faces.\n\nTo see why, note that the Principle of \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion:\n\n\\(\\forall y([\\lambda x\\, \\phi ]y \\equiv \\phi^y_x)\\) \n\nseems to be an analytic truth of logic. It says this: \n\nAn object \\(y\\) exemplifies the complex property being such\nthat \\(\\phi\\) if and only if \\(y\\) is such that \\(\\phi\\). \n\nOne might argue that this is true in virtue of the very meaning of the\n\\(\\lambda\\)-expression, the meaning of \\(\\equiv\\), and the meaning of\nthe statement \\([\\lambda x\\, \\phi]y\\) (which has the form \\( Fx)\\).\nHowever, \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion also implies the Comprehension\nPrinciple for Concepts, for the latter follows from the former by\nexistential generalization: \n\n\\(\\exists F\\forall y(Fy \\equiv \\phi^y_x)\\) \n\nThe point here is that the fact that an existential claim is derivable\ncasts at least some doubt on the purely analytic status of\n\\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion. The question of how we obtain knowledge of\nsuch principles is still an open question in philosophy. It is an\nimportant question to address, since Frege\u2019s most insightful\ndefinitions are cast using quantifiers ranging over concepts and\nrelations (e.g., the ancestrals of a relation) and it would be useful\nto have a philosophical explanation of how such entities and the\nprinciples which govern them become known to us. In contemporary\nphilosophy, this question is still poignant, since many philosophers\ndo accept that properties and relations of various\nsorts exist. These entities are the contemporary analogues of\nFrege\u2019s concepts.\n6.4 The Existence of Extensions\n\nThough the existence of extensions falls right out of the theory of\nidentity (\u00a72.3) once terms of the form \\(\\epsilon F\\) are added\nto second-order logic, the existence of extensions that are correlated\none-to-one with concepts is a consequence of Basic Law V. The question\nfor Frege\u2019s project, then, is why should we accept as a law of\nlogic a statement that implies the existence of individuals and a\ncorrelation of this kind? Frege recognized that Basic Law V\u2019s\nstatus as a logical law could be doubted: \n\n[Gg I, Preface, p. 3:]\n\nA dispute can arise, so far as I can see, only with regard to my Basic\nLaw concerning courses-of-values (V) \\(\\ldots\\) I hold that it is a\nlaw of pure logic. [from the Furth translation in Frege 1967]\n\n\nMoreover, he thought that an appeal to extensions would answer one of\nthe questions that motivated his work: \n\n[Letter to Russell, July 28, 1902:]\n\nI myself was long reluctant to recognize ranges of values and hence\nclasses [sets]; but I saw no other possibility of placing arithmetic\non a logical foundation. But the question is, How do we apprehend\nlogical objects? And I have found no other answer to it than this, We\napprehend them as extensions of concepts, or more generally, as ranges\nof values of functions. [from the Kaal translation in Frege 1980]\n\n\nNow it is unclear why Frege thought that he could answer the question\nposed here by saying that we apprehend numbers as the extensions of\nconcepts. He seems to think we can answer the obvious next question\n\u201cHow do we apprehend extensions?\u201d by saying \u201cby way\nof Basic Law V\u201d. \n\nHis idea here seems to be that since Basic Law V is supposed to be\npurely analytic or true in virtue of the meanings of its terms, we\napprehend a pair of extensions whenever we truly judge that concepts\n\\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are materially equivalent. Some philosophers do argue\nthat certain\nconsistent principles having the same logical form as Basic\nLaw V are analytic, and that such principles justify\nreference to the entities described in the left-side\ncondition by grounding such reference in the truth of the\nright-side\n condition.[15]\n\nWhy did Frege think that Basic Law V is analytic and that the material\nequivalence of concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) is analytically equivalent to\nan identity that implies the existence of extensions? To hold that\nBasic Law V is analytic, it seems that one must hold that the\nright-side condition implies the corresponding left-side condition as\na matter of\n meaning.[16]\n This view, however, can be questioned. Suppose the right hand\ncondition implies the left-side condition as a matter of meaning. That\nis, suppose that (R) implies (L) as a matter of meaning:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\tag{R} &\\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx) \\\\\n\\tag{L} &\\epsilon F = \\epsilon G\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nNow note that (L) itself can be analyzed, from a logical point of\nview. The expression \u2018\\(\\epsilon F\\)\u2019, though constructed\nfrom a term-forming operator, is really a definite description\n(\u2018the extension of \\(F\\)\u2019) and so, using\nRussell\u2019s theory of descriptions, (L) can be logically analyzed\nas the claim: \n\nThere is an object \\(x\\) and an object \\(y\\) such that:\n\n(1) \\(x\\) is a unique extension of \\(F\\),\n\n(2) \\(y\\) is a unique extension of \\(G\\), and\n\n(3) \\(x = y\\). \n\nThat is, for some defined or primitive notion\n\\(\\mathit{Extension}(x,F)\\) (\u2018\\(x\\) is an extension of\n\\(F\\)\u2019), (L) implies the analysis (D) as a matter of\nmeaning:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\tag{D} &\\exists x\\exists\ny[\\mathit{Extension}(x,F) \\amp \\forall z(\\mathit{Extension}(z,F) \\to\nz\\eqclose x)\\ \\amp \\\\ &\\quad \\mathit{Extension}(y,G) \\amp \\forall\nz(\\mathit{Extension}(z,G) \\to z\\eqclose y) \\amp x\\eqclose y]\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nBut if (R) implies (L) as a matter of meaning, and (L) implies (D) as\na matter of meaning, then (R) implies (D) as a matter of meaning. This\nconclusion can be questioned: why should the material equivalence of\n\\(F\\) and \\(G\\) imply the existence claim (D) as a matter of meaning?\nIn other words, the suggestion that Va (i.e., the right-to-left\ndirection of Basic Law V) is analytic leads to a question that has no\nobvious answer. Below, this line of reasoning will be adapted to\nquestion the analyticity of the right-to-left direction of\nHume\u2019s Principle. See Boolos 1997 (307\u2013309), for reasons\nwhy \\(Vb\\) (the left-to-right direction of Hume\u2019s Principle) is\nnot analytic.]\n\nThe moral to be drawn here is that, even if Basic Law V were\nconsistent, it is not exactly clear how its right side analytically\nimplies the existence of extensions. In the end, we may need some\nother way of justifying our knowledge of principles like Basic Law V,\nthat imply the existence of abstract objects \u2013 the justification\ndiscussed so far seems to contain a gap. Even if we follow Frege in\nconceiving of extensions as \u2018logical objects\u2019, the\nquestion remains: how can the claims that such objects exist be true\non logical or analytic grounds alone? We might agree that there must\nbe logical objects of some sort if logic is to have a subject matter,\nbut if Frege is to achieve his goal of showing that our knowledge of\narithmetic is free of intuition, then at some point he has to address\nthe question of how we can know that numbers exist. We\u2019ll return\nto this issue in the final subsection.\n6.5 The Existence of Numbers and Truth-Values: The Julius Caesar Problem\n\nGiven that the proof of Frege\u2019s Theorem makes no appeal to Basic\nLaw V, some philosophers have argued Frege\u2019s best strategy for\nproducing an epistemologically-justified foundation for arithmetic is\nto replace the primitive term \\(\\epsilon F\\) with the primitive term\n\\(\\#F\\), replace Basic Law V with Hume\u2019s Principle, and argue\nthat Hume\u2019s Principle is an analytic principle of\n logic.[17]\n However, we have just seen one reason why such a strategy does not\nsuffice. The claim that Hume\u2019s Principle is an analytic\nprinciple of logic is subject to the same problem just posed for Basic\nLaw V. A reason must be given as to why the claim:\n\n\\(F \\approx G\\) \n\nimplies, as a matter of meaning, that:\n\n\\(\\#F = \\#G\\) \n\nAfter all, the statement \u201c\\(\\#F = \\#G\\)\u201d is analyzable in\na manner analogous to the way we analyzed \u201c\\(\\epsilon F =\n\\epsilon G\\)\u201d in the previous section, where we used\nRussell\u2019s theory of description to analyze the sentence (L) as\nthe sentence (D). Following that pattern, we take the primitive notion\n\\(\\mathit{Numbers}(x,F)\\) and analyze \\(\\#F = \\#G\\) as:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} &\\exists x\\exists y[\\mathit{Numbers}(x,F) \\amp\n\\forall z(\\mathit{Numbers}(z,F) \\to z\\eqclose x)\\ \\amp \\\\ &\\quad\n\\mathit{Numbers}(y,G) \\amp \\forall z (\\mathit{Numbers}(z,G) \\to\nz\\eqclose y) \\amp x\\eqclose y] \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nIt is not clear why we should think that this last claim is implied by\n\\(F \\approx G\\) as a matter of meaning. The right-to-left direction of\nHume\u2019s Principle is not obviously analytic.\n\nMoreover, Frege had his own reasons for not replacing Basic Law V with\nHume\u2019s Principle. One reason was that he thought Hume\u2019s\nPrinciple offered no answer to the epistemological question,\n\u2018How do we grasp or apprehend logical objects, such as the\nnumbers?\u2019. A second reason is that Hume\u2019s Principle is\nclearly subject to \u2018the Julius Caesar problem\u2019. Frege\nfirst raises this problem in connection with an inductive definition\nof \u2018\\(n = \\#F\\)\u2019 that he tries out in Gl,\n\u00a755. Concerning this definition, Frege says:\n\n[Gl, \u00a756:]\n\n\u2026 but we can never \u2013 to take a crude example \u2014\ndecide by means of our definitions whether any concept has the number\nJulius Caesar belonging to it, or whether that conqueror of Gaul is a\nnumber or is not. [from the Austin translation in Frege 1953]\n\n\nFrege raises this same concern again for a contextual definition that\ngives a \u2018criterion of identity\u2019 for the objects being\ndefined. In Gl \u00a766, Frege considers the\nfollowing contextual definition of \u2018the direction of line\n\\(x\\)\u2019: \n\nThe direction of line \\(a\\) = the direction of line \\(b\\) if and only\nif \\(a\\) is parallel to \\(b\\).\n\n\nWith regard to this definition, Frege says: \n\n[Gl, \u00a766:]\n\nIt will not, for instance, decide for us whether England is the same\nas the direction of the Earth\u2019s axis \u2013 if I may be\nforgiven an example which looks nonsensical. Naturally no one is going\nto confuse England with the direction of the Earth\u2019s axis; but\nthat is no thanks to our definition of direction. [from the Austin\ntranslation in Frege 1953]\n\n\nNow trouble for Hume\u2019s Principle begins to arise when we\nrecognize that it is a contextual definition that has the same logical\nform as this definition for directions. It is central to Frege\u2019s\nview that the numbers are objects, and so he believes that it\nis incumbent upon him to say which objects they are. But the\n\u2018Julius Caesar problem\u2019 is that Hume\u2019s Principle, if\nconsidered as the sole principle offering identity conditions for\nnumbers, doesn\u2019t describe the conditions under which an\narbitrary object, say Julius Caesar, is or is not to be identified\nwith the number of planets. That is, Hume\u2019s Principle\ndoesn\u2019t define the condition \u2018\\(\\#F = x\\)\u2019, for\narbitrary \\(x\\). It only offers identity conditions when \\(x\\) is an\nobject known to be a cardinal number (for then \\(x = \\#G\\), for some\n\\(G\\), and Hume\u2019s Principle tells us when \\(\\#F = \\#G\\)).\n\nIn Gl, Frege solves the problem by giving his\nexplicit definition of numbers in terms of extensions. (We described\nthis in \u00a74 above.) Unfortunately, this is only a stopgap measure,\nfor when Frege later systematizes extensions in Gg,\nBasic Law V has the same logical form as Hume\u2019s Principle and\nthe above contextual definition of directions. Frege is aware that the\nJulius Caesar problem affects Basic Law V, as the discussion in\nGg I, \u00a710 shows. In that section, he says\n(remembering that for Frege, \\(\\epsilon\\) binds object variables and\nis not a function term):\n\n[Gg I, \u00a710:]\n\n\\(\\ldots\\) this by no means fixes completely the denotation of a name\nlike \u2018\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\epsilon}\\!\\Phi(\\epsilon)\\)\u2019.\nWe have only a means of always recognizing a course-of-values if it is\ndesignated by a name like \u2018\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\epsilon}\\!\\Phi\n(\\epsilon)\\)\u2019, by which it is already recognizable as a\ncourse-of-values. But, we can neither decide, so far, whether an\nobject is a course-of-values that is not given us as such \\(\\ldots\\)\n[from the Furth translation in Frege 1967]\n\n\nIn other words, Basic Law V does not tell us the conditions under\nwhich an arbitrarily chosen object \\(x\\) may be identified with some\ngiven extension, such as \\(\\epsilon F\\).\n\nUntil recently, it was thought that Frege solved this problem in\n\u00a710 by restricting the universal quantifier \\(\\forall x\\) of his\nGg system so that it ranges only over extensions. If\nFrege could have successfully restricted this quantifier to\nextensions, then when the question arises, whether (arbitrarily\nchosen) object \\(x\\) is identical with \\(\\epsilon F\\), one could\nanswer that \\(x\\) has to be the extension of some concept, say \\( G\\),\nand that Basic Law V would then tell you the conditions under which\n\\(x\\) is identical to \\(\\epsilon F\\). On this interpretation of\n\u00a710, Frege is alleged to have restricted the quantifiers when he\nidentified the two truth values (The True and The False) with the two\nextensions that contain just these objects as members, respectively.\nBy doing this, it was thought that all of the objects in the range of\nhis quantifier \\(\\forall x\\) in Gg become extensions\nwhich have been identified as such, for the truth values were the only\ntwo objects of his system that had not been introduced as extensions\nor courses of value.\n\nHowever, recent work by Wehmeier (1999) suggests that, in \u00a710,\nFrege was not attempting to restrict the quantifiers of his system to\nextensions (nor, more generally, to courses-of-values). The extensive\nfootnote to \u00a710 indicates that Frege considered, but did not hold\nmuch hope of, identifying every object in the domain with the\nextension consisting of just that\n object.[18]\n But, more importantly, Frege later considers cases (in\nGg, Sections 34 and 35) which seem to presuppose that\nthe domain contains objects which aren\u2019t extensions. (In these\nsections, Frege considers what happens to the definition of \u2018\\(\nx\\) is a member of \\(y\\)\u2019 when \\(y\\) is not an\n extension.)[19]\n\nEven if Frege somehow could have successfully restricted the\nquantifiers of Gg to avoid the Julius Caesar problem,\nhe would no longer have been able to apply his system by extending it\nto include names of ordinary non-logical objects. For if he were to\nattempt to do so, the question, \u201cUnder what conditions is\n\\(\\epsilon F\\) identical with Julius Caesar?\u201d, would then be\nlegitimate but have no answer. That means his logical system could not\nbe used for the analysis of ordinary language. But it was just the\nanalysis of ordinary language that led Frege to his insight that a\nstatement of number is an assertion about a concept.\n6.6 Final Observations\n\nEven when we replace the inconsistent Basic Law V with the powerful\nHume\u2019s Principle, Frege\u2019s work still leaves two questions\nunanswered: (1) How do we know that numbers exist?, and (2) How do we\nprecisely specify which objects they are? The first question arises\nbecause Hume\u2019s Principle doesn\u2019t seem to be a purely\nanalytic truth of logic; if neither Hume\u2019s Principle nor the\nexistential claim that numbers exist is analytically true, by what\nfaculty do we come to know (the truth of) the existential claim? The\nsecond question arises because the Julius Caesar problem applies to\nHume\u2019s Principle; without a solution to that problem, Frege can\u2019t\nclaim to have precisely specified which objects the numbers are, so as\nto delineate them within the domain of all logical and non-logical\nobjects? So questions about the very existence and identity of numbers\nstill affect Frege\u2019s work.\n\nThese two questions arise because of a limitation in the logical form\nof these Fregean biconditional principles such as Hume\u2019s\nPrinciple and Basic Law V. These contextual definitions combine two\njobs which modern logicians now typically accomplish with separate\nprinciples. A properly reformulated theory of \u2018logical\u2019\nobjects should have separate principles: (1) one or more principles\nwhich assert the existence of logical objects, and (2) a\nseparate identity principle which asserts the conditions under which\nlogical objects are identical. The latter should specify\nidentity conditions for logical objects in terms of their most salient\ncharacteristic, one which distinguishes them from other objects. Such\nan identity principle would then be more specific than the global\nidentity principle for all objects (Leibniz\u2019s Law) which asserts\nthat if objects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) fall under the same concepts, they are\nidentical.\n\nBy way of example, consider modern set theory. Zermelo set theory \\(\n(Z)\\) has several distinctive set existence principles. For example,\nconsider the well-known Subset (or Separation) Axiom:\n\nSubset (Separation) Axiom of Z:\n\n\\(\\forall x[\\mathit{Set}(x) \\to \\exists y[\\mathit{Set}(y) \\amp \\forall\nz(z \\in y \\equiv (z \\in x \\amp \\phi))]]\\),\n\nwhere \\(\\phi\\) is any formula in which \\(y\\) isn\u2019t free \n\nThe Subset Axiom and the other set existence axioms in Z are distinct\nfrom Z\u2019s identity principle for sets:\n\nIdentity Principle for Sets:\n\n\\(\\mathit{Set}(x) \\amp \\mathit{Set}(y) \\to [\\forall z(z \\in x \\equiv z\n\\in y) \\to x\\eqclose y]\\) \n\nNote that the second principle offers identity conditions in terms of\nthe most salient features of sets, namely, the fact that they, unlike\nother objects, have members. The identity conditions for objects which\naren\u2019t sets, then, can be the standard principle that\nidentifies objects whenever they fall under the same concepts. This\nleads us naturally to a very general principle of identity for any\nobjects whatever:\n\nGeneral Principle of Identity: \n\n\\[\\begin{align*} &x = y \\eqdef [\\mathit{Set}(x) \\amp\n\\mathit{Set}(y) \\amp \\forall z(z \\in x \\equiv z \\in y)]\\ \\lor \\\\\n&\\quad [\\neg \\mathit{Set}(x) \\amp \\neg \\mathit{Set}(y) \\amp\n\\forall F(Fx \\equiv Fy)] \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nNow, if something is given to us as a set and we ask whether\nit is identical with an arbitrarily chosen object \\(x\\), this\nspecifies a clear condition that settles the matter. The only\nquestions that remain for the theory \\(Z\\) concern its existence\nprinciple: Do we know that the Subset Axiom and other set existence\nprinciples are true, and if so, how? The question of existence is thus\nlaid bare. We do not approach it by attempting to justify a principle\nthat implies the existence of sets via definite descriptions which we\ndon\u2019t yet know to be well-defined.\n\nIn some classic essays (1987 and 1986/87), Boolos appears to recommend\nthis very procedure of using separate existence and identity\nprinciples. In those essays, he eschews the primitive mathematical\nrelation of set membership and suggests that Frege could formulate his\ntheory of numbers (\u2018Frege Arithmetic\u2019) by using a single\nnonlogical comprehension axiom which employs a special\ninstantiation relation that holds between a concept \\(G\\) and an\nobject \\(x\\) whenever, intuitively, \\(x\\) is an extension consisting\nsolely of concepts and \\(G\\) is a concept \u2018in\u2019 \\(x\\). He\ncalls this nonlogical axiom \u2018Numbers\u2019 and uses the\nnotation \u2018\\(G\u03b7x\\)\u2019 to signify that \\(G\\) is in\n\\(x\\):\n\nNumbers:\n\n\\(\\forall F\\exists !x\\forall G(G\u03b7x \\equiv G\\approx F)\\) \n\n[See Boolos 1987 (5), 1986/87 (140).] This principle asserts that for any\nconcept \\(F\\), there is a unique object which contains in it all and\nonly those concepts \\(G\\) which are equinumerous to \\(F\\). Boolos then\nmakes two observations: (1) Frege can then define \\(\\#F\\) as\n\u201cthe unique object \\(x\\) such that for all concepts \\(G\\), \\(G\\)\nis in \\(x\\) iff \\(G\\) is equinumerous to \\(F\\)\u201d, and (2)\nHume\u2019s Principle is derivable from Numbers. [See Boolos 1986/87\n(140).] Given these observations, we know from our work in\n\u00a7\u00a74 and 5 above that Numbers suffices for the derivation of\nthe basic laws of arithmetic.\n\nSince Boolos calls this principle \u2018Numbers\u2019, it is no\nstretch to suppose that he would accept the following reformulation\n(in which \u2018\\(\\mathit{Number}(x)\\)\u2019 is an undefined,\nprimitive notion):\n\nNumbers:\n\n\\(\\forall F\\exists !x [\\mathit{Number}(x) \\amp \\forall G(G\u03b7x\n\\equiv G\\approx F)]\\) \n\nThough Boolos doesn\u2019t explicitly formulate an identity principle\nto complement Numbers, it seems clear that the following principle\nwould offer identity conditions in terms of the most distinctive\nfeature of numbers:\n\nIdentity Principle for Numbers:\n\n\\(\\mathit{Number}(x) \\amp \\mathit{Number}(y) \\to [\\forall G(G\u03b7x\n\\equiv G\u03b7y) \\to x\\eqclose y]\\) \n\nIt is then straightforward to formulate a general principle of\nidentity, as we did in the case of the set theory \\(Z\\): \n\nGeneral Principle of Identity: \n\n\\[\\begin{align*} &x = y \\eqdef [\\mathit{Number}(x)\\amp\n\\mathit{Number}(y) \\amp \\forall F(F\u03b7x \\equiv F\u03b7y)] \\:\\lor \\\\\n&\\quad [\\neg \\mathit{Number}(x) \\amp \\neg \\mathit{Number}(y) \\amp\n\\forall F(Fx\\equiv Fy)] \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nThis formulation of Frege Arithmetic, in terms of Numbers and the\nGeneral Principle of Identity, puts the Julius Caesar problem\n(described above) into better perspective; the condition \u2018\\(\\#F\n= x\\)\u2019 is defined for arbitrary concepts \\(F\\) and objects\n\\(x\\). It openly faces the epistemological questions head-on: Do we\nknow that Numbers is true, and if so, how? This is where philosophers\nneed to concentrate their energies. [For a reconstruction of Frege\nArithmetic with a more general version of the special instantiation\nrelation \u03b7, see Zalta 1999.] \n\nBy replacing Fregean biconditionals such as Hume\u2019s Principle\nwith separate existence and identity principles, we reduce two\nproblems to one and and isolate the real problem for Fregean\nfoundations of arithmetic, namely, the problem of giving an\nepistemological justification for distinctive existence claims (e.g.,\nNumbers) for abstract objects of a certain kind. For if anything like\nFrege\u2019s program is to succeed, it must at some point assert (as\nan axiom or theorem) the existence of (logical) objects of some kind.\nThose separate existence claims should be the focus of attention.",
