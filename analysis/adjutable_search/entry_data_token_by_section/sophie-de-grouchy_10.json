    "main_text": "Philosophy\n4. Philosophy\n\nThe Letters on Sympathy, where the greatest part of\nGrouchy\u2019s philosophy is to be found, are principally a response\nto Smith\u2019s Theory of Moral Sentiments. The author\nstates in the first letter that her writing was prompted by reading\nSmith\u2019s book, and that where she disagreed with him, she wanted\nto develop her own views and arguments. Later in that letter she says\nwhat specifically she disagrees with: Smith does not investigate the\norigins of sympathy, and hence his account of its effects must be\nincomplete. Elsewhere in the Letters she specifies aspects of\nher argument where she either agrees or disagrees with Smith.\n\nGrouchy is also writing in the context of the French revolution, and\nattempting, with her husband, to help bring about a number of reforms\nin France. This means that her philosophy is mostly focused on value\ntheory\u2014specifically moral, social, legal, economic and political\ntheory.\n\nTheoretical influences come from philosophers who turned to psychology\nand cognitive development such as Locke and Condillac. As far as\npolitical philosophy was concerned, we find influences from Voltaire\nand Rousseau, but also Fenelon and Montesquieu.\n\nA further influence must be noted, that of her choice of\ncorrespondent, C***. Jean-George Cabanis was a medical doctor by\ntraining, but also a writer who attempted to combine his scientific\nknowledge with moral and social philosophy. His main work, On the\nrelations between the physical and moral aspects of man in 1802\ndescribes the effects that physiology has on moral\npsychology\u2014character, he says, is inevitably affected by the\nbody\u2019s reaction to the weather, and by the function of organs,\nsuch as digestion. In her work, Grouchy also emphasizes the role of\nphysiology in morality, arguing that sympathy arises first and\nforemost out of the sensations caused by internal organs.\n",
