    "main_text": "\n\n\nPhilodemus of Gadara (ca. 110\u2013ca. 30 BCE) was an Epicurean\nphilosopher and epigrammatist who, having studied in the Epicurean\nschool at Athens when it was led by Zeno of Sidon (c. 150\u2013c. 75\nBCE), moved to Italy, probably in the 70s BCE. There he may\nhave lived in the Greek town of Naples, and perhaps also in Rome. Some\nof Philodemus\u2019 poems, which were praised by Cicero, were\npreserved in the Palatine Anthology, and these were all that\nwas known of his writing until the discovery in the\nmid-18th century of a trove of papyrus manuscripts in the\nruins of a grand villa in Herculaneum, buried by the eruption of\nVesuvius in 79 CE. The majority of these were philosophical works of\nhis.\n\n\nA self-proclaimed interpreter of Epicurus and the first generation of\nEpicureans, as well as the devoted follower of his master Zeno of\nSidon, Philodemus\u2019 claim on our attention does not rest on the\noriginality of his philosophical doctrines. There may have been scope\nfor such originality, especially in his approach to the liberal arts,\ntraditionally neglected or even deprecated by Epicureans. What we can\nsee in his work is the effort by a latter-day Epicurean to work out\npositions which the school\u2019s founders may have put forward, but\nwhich were no longer up to date in the context of continuing debate\namong the Hellenistic schools. Further, he attempts to uphold a\nparticular view of Epicurean orthodoxy against that held by rival\nEpicureans who had a different interpretation of a number of\npositions of the school, these too presumably developed in response to\nchallenges and to positions of other schools which had advanced the\nstate of the discussion in many areas. One battleground among these\nEpicurean rivals was the use of Epicurean texts, the importance of\ncollecting and studying the entire corpus of the school\u2019s\nfounders\u2019 works, their philological and philosophical exegesis,\nand the place of epitomes and compendia vis-\u00e0-vis the\nextensive and detailed works of the corpus. This concern for authority\nin the interpretation, upholding, and teaching of Epicurean\northodoxy, feeds into Philodemus\u2019 concern for the healthy\nconduct of his school, for its life as a community of philosophers,\nboth students and teachers, studying Epicurean and other texts while\ntrying to lead the kind of philosophical life commended by the\nschool.\n",
