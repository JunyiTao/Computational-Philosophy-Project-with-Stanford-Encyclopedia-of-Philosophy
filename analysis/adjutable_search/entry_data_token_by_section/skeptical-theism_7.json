    "main_text": "Outweighing Goods and Inductive Inferences || Connecting Goods\n2.3 Connecting Goods\n\nSkeptical theists object to the inference from NKG to\nNaaG. But some skeptical theists also object directly\nto NKG (see Alston 1996: 315-6; Plantinga 1998: 53;\nBergmann 2009: 382). Given ST3, it may be\nthat some outweighing goods we know of would justify\nGod\u2019s permissions of the fawn\u2019s suffering and the\ngirl\u2019s suffering. It may simply be that the connection between\nthe outweighing goods we are familiar with and God\u2019s permission\nof suffering is not known to us. Again, skeptical theists might appeal\nto analogies to clarify their position. A novice chess player knows\nthat a grandmaster\u2019s objective is to win the game. But it\ndoesn\u2019t follow that the novice chess player understands how each\nmove the grandmaster makes might contribute to the grandmaster\u2019s\nobjective. In fact, it might even seem to the novice player that\nvarious moves by the grandmaster don\u2019t contribute to that\nobjective at all.\n",
