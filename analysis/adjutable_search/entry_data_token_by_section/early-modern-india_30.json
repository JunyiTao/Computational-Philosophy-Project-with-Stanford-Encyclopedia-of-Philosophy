    "main_text": "Meaning, Understanding and Testimony || Testimony\n9.3 Testimony\n\nThe Manual of Reason says that statements are either Vedic or\nsecular. It adds that (hearing a) Vedic statement is a\npram\u0101\u1e47a, a means of knowing that which is stated,\nbecause Vedic statements are originally uttered by God. (The\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas dispute this. Not believing in God, they\nsay instead that a Vedic statement is a means of knowing precisely\nbecause it has no personal origin, and error in testimony is always a\nresult of human error in the source!) Hearing a secular statement is a\nmeans of knowing only if the speaker is an \u2018authoritative\nperson\u2019 (\u0101pta). An authoritative person is defined\nas one who speaks the truth (yath\u0101rthavakt\u0101). There\nis an ambiguity here: is an authoritative person one who is speaking\nthe truth with respect to the particular utterance in question, or one\nwho is generally truthful? Another question here is: must the\ntestifiee know that the testifier is an authority in this sense or\nnot?\n\nTo confuse matters further, The Manual of Reason says that\nthe \u2018gu\u1e47a\u2019, causal factor responsible for\nthe truth of the testifiee\u2019s belief, is\n\u2018yath\u0101rtha-yogyat\u0101-j\u00f1\u0101na\u2019,\nwhich can mean either (i) veridical cognition of semantic fitness, or\n(ii) cognition of veridical semantic fitness. In either case, the\n\u2018gu\u1e47a\u2019 has nothing to do with the\nspeaker\u2019s credentials, it seems. Option (ii), however, must be\nwrong, for it cannot be a condition upon testimony that the hearer\nalready knows that what was said is true. Option (i), however, would\nnot guarantee that the final hearer\u2019s belief is true, unless by\n\u2018fitness\u2019 The Manual of Reason now intends a\nrather stronger notion, according to which the meaning-relata\n\u2018fit\u2019 together iff they are in fact connected, i.e. if the\nutterance expresses a truth. This is, indeed, how some other\nNaiy\u0101yikas understand the notion of yogyat\u0101, but\ndoes not accord with The Manual of Reason\u2019s own\ndefinition.\n\nI propose the following resolution. The language processing mechanism\nwas described above as one which issues in the testifiee believing\nthat which the testifier says. The truth of the testifiee\u2019s\nbelief will therefore depend upon whether or not the testifier is\nspeaking truly, and so this should be called the\n\u2018gu\u1e47a\u2019 here. However, we do not always\nbelieve what we hear, especially if we have reasons to suppose that\nthe speaker is not likely to be speaking the truth. It is possible,\nthen, that the output of the language processing mechanism is not\nsimply belief in what was said, but rather belief simply\nthat it has been said. There are, roughly, two sorts of case\nwhen this can happen: (1) if the testifiee judges that the testifier\nis deceitful or unreliable or simply uninformed about the topic, and\n(2) if the testifiee knows on independent grounds that what the\ntestifier is saying is false (which is consistent with the testifier\nbelieving it and testifying sincerely), perhaps on a priori\ngrounds concerning the plausibility of the assertion. With a little\ninterpretative licence, we might think that these two conditions\ncorrespond to the two conditions imposed by The Manual of\nReason on testimony: that the testifier must be an\n\u2018authority\u2019 (\u0101pta), and that the sentence\nmust be \u2018semantically fit\u2019 (yogya).\n",
