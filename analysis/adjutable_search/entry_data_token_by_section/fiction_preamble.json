    "main_text": "\n\n\nTelling fictional stories and engaging with the fictional stories of\nothers is an important and pervasive part of human culture. But people\nnot only tell and engage with fictional stories. They also reflect on\nthe content of stories, and on the way these are told. Grappling with\nthe many issues such reflection uncovers has long been a concern of\nprofessional academics in language departments and other academic\nprograms with a focus on language. Philosophers should be included on\nthis list. The concept of fiction gives rise to a number of intriguing\nand complex philosophical issues, and the philosophy of fiction has\nnow become an acknowledged part of mainstream philosophy, with a\nhistory that goes back at least to the early debates about the role of\npoets and dramatists found in the works of Aristotle and Plato. The\nissues in question broadly relate to fiction as a mode of\nrepresentation\u2014a way of describing individuals and\nevents\u2014that is strikingly different from representation\nconcerned with truth, the latter long a dominant theme in philosophy.\nNot only is faithfulness to truth in the ordinary sense not a\nrequirement in fiction; fiction may even depart from truth in the\nthings it talks about, which typically include nonexistent\nindividuals and even members of nonexistent kinds (Holmes and hobbits,\nfor example)\u2014see the entry on \n fictional entities.\n\n\n\nThere are also more indirect reasons for taking fiction seriously as a\nphilosophical topic. The last few decades have seen a surge of\ninterest in interpreting prominent yet (arguably) philosophically\nproblematic areas of enquiry\u2014areas as far apart as mathematics\nand morality\u2014as involving something akin to fiction, a position\nknown as fictionalism about those areas. On such views, we should not\nbelieve the central claims of the area because of their commitment to\nentities like numbers and objective moral facts; instead we should\ntreat them the way we treat a distinctively fictional claim like\n\u201cSherlock Holmes was a brilliant detective\u201d: something we\nknow not to be literally true (after all, there never was a Sherlock\nHolmes) but accept as true in some derivative or at least nonliteral\nsense (unlike \u201cHolmes was a plodding policeman\u201d, say). The\ncontinuing rise of fictionalism presents us with a new reason for\ntreating fiction as a significant philosophical topic, since it is a\nposition that is difficult to motivate independently of an\nunderstanding of what is distinctive about fiction (Armour-Garb and\nWoodbridge 2015). (For more on fictionalism and its ties to fiction,\nsee the entry on\n fictionalism.)\n\n\nOne fundamental question raised by the notion of fiction is a\nconceptual one: What makes something a work of fiction as opposed to a\nwork of non-fiction? A first attempt at saying what fiction is might\nportray it as a kind of writing whose product is a written text (a\nwork of fiction) that misrepresents how the world actually is,\nalthough not in order to deceive intended readers. This opposes it to\nnon-fiction; even if a work of non-fiction misrepresents the world, it\nis not intended by its author to be recognized as something that\nmisrepresents the world. \n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to see that this rough characterization is\nin fact far too rough. A work of fiction needn\u2019t be a written\ntext, but could be a picture (or series of pictures) or a\nrepresentation in some other medium like film. And the\ncharacterization lets in too much: a newspaper article attacking some\npolitical position by engaging in the relentless use of irony, say, is\nnot a work of fiction but a work of non-fiction that uses irony.\n\n\nThe problem of saying how fiction differs from non-fiction is just one\nof the hard problems faced by the philosophical study of fiction.\nAnother problem is that of specifying the sense in which a fictional\nsentence can be true despite misdescribing how matters stand in the\nworld. (A sentence like \u201cSherlock Holmes was a brilliant\ndetective\u201d, for example, is not true if it is construed as a\nclaim about brilliant detectives our world has known, but counts as\ntrue if it is stated as an answer to a quiz question \u201cWho was\nSherlock Holmes?\u201d By contrast, \u201cSherlock Holmes was a\nplodding policeman\u201d would count as false in this context.) But\nin what sense can the sentence be true, given that the world does not\ncontain any such person as Sherlock Holmes?  One promising thought is\nthat when we hear the sentence as genuinely true we regard it as\nelliptical for something like \u201cIn the Holmes stories,\nSherlock Holmes was a brilliant detective\u201d. On this suggestion it\nis the truth of the latter prefixed sentence that provides the sense\nin which \u201cSherlock Holmes was a brilliant detective\u201d\ncounts as true.  But even if this is right, what still needs\nexplaining is what it is for such a prefixed sentence to be true.\nWhat makes \u201cIn the Holmes stories, Sherlock Holmes was\na brilliant detective\u201d true (but not \u201cIn\nthe Holmes stories, Sherlock Holmes was a plodding\npoliceman\u201d), when there never was such a person as Sherlock\nHolmes? In addition to the problem of how to understand the notion of\ntruth in a work of fiction, there is also a deep puzzle about the way\nwe respond emotionally to such truths. When we engage with fiction, we\noften do so at a highly specific emotional level\u2014we may not only\nbe enthralled by elements of the plot but also affected by what\nbefalls particular characters. Thus, we may find ourselves feeling\npity for Anna Karenina as we near the end of Tolstoy\u2019s novel\nbecause we are aware of Anna\u2019s suffering. But the claim that we\npity Anna Karenina is deeply puzzling: we know there is no Anna\nKarenina, and that it is only true in Tolstoy\u2019s novel that Anna\nKarenina is suffering, so how can there be genuine pity for Anna? This\nis the so-called paradox of fiction, one of a batch of puzzles that\nhave been raised in the philosophy of fiction about our engagement\nwith works of fiction.\n\n\nThese are by no means the only philosophical questions thrown up by\nfiction. In fact, the paradox of fiction immediately suggests others.\nTaken at face value, a statment like \u201cSherlock Holmes was a\nbrilliant detective\u201d seems at best to be true in a work of\nfiction rather than true outright. By contrast, a statement like\n\u201cMany readers pity Anna Karenina\u201d seems to be true\noutright. (The same goes for other statements relating fictional\ncharacters to the real world, for example \u201cConan Doyle created\nHolmes\u201d, \u201cFrodo doesn\u2019t exist\u201d, and\n\u201cHolmes is more famous than any real detective\u201d.) This\nraises the thorny issue of the ontological commitments of talk\ninvolving fiction. If it is genuinely true that many readers feel pity\nfor Anna Karenina or that Doyle created Holmes, then presumably there\nare things\u2014Anna Karenina and Holmes\u2014about whom this is\ntrue. But how is the claim that there are such objects consistent with\nthe obvious truth that Holmes and Anna Karenina don\u2019t exist? And\nwhat could such nonexistent objects be like? We leave detailed\ncommentary on such ontological and metaphysical questions to the entry\non\n fictional entities.\n The present entry is devoted to the nature of fiction and its\n\u201ctruths\u201d, including our emotional engagement with these\ntruths\u2014topics that can be discussed independently of whether one\nis a realist or an antirealist about fictional entities. Before we\nbegin, it is worth noting that the study of these topics is not the\nprovince of philosophers alone. Just what is fiction, for example, is\na question that also engages narratologists and historians of fiction\n(see, e.g., Gallagher 2006, Walsh 2007), although they approach the\nissue from different academic perspectives, often with somewhat\ndifferent aims in mind. The present entry focuses mainly on the work of\nphilosophers. \n",
