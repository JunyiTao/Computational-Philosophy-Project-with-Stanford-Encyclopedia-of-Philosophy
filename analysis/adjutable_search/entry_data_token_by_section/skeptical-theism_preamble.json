There\u2019s the annoyance of a\nstubbed toe, the disappointment of personal or professional setback,\nthe endless frustration of debilitating chronic pain, and the\nsoul-crushing experience of the suffering and death of those we care\nthe most about (to name a few). It doesn\u2019t require extensive\neducation to worry if suffering and evil is evidence against the\nexistence of God\u2014or, at least, God understood classically, as a\nperfect being that is an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-good creator\nof the universe. This is the problem of evil, and when these worries\nare turned into arguments, they are known as arguments from evil.\n\nBut many of us\u2014again, theist, atheist, and agnostic\nalike\u2014are impressed by what God is supposed to be: a being with\nall perfections and knowledge, unencumbered by weaknesses or faults.\nGiven our own ignorance, imperfections, and limitations, it is hard to\nfully imagine such a being and its potential plans for the world.\nAgain, it doesn\u2019t require extensive education to worry that it\nwould be incredibly challenging for us\u2014in such a comparatively\nbenighted state\u2014to predict, anticipate, or understand all of the\nplans of such a being.\n\nSkeptical theism is a family of responses to arguments from evil.\nSkeptical theists think these two types of worries are related, that\nworries of the second type raise problems for worries of the first\ntype. More specifically, skeptical theism embraces two claims. First,\neven if theism were true, we should be skeptical of our abilities to\nreasonably predict all of God\u2019s plans for organizing the world,\nincluding those about the amount and nature of evil. Second, if this\nfirst claim is true, then it undermines or otherwise greatly mitigates\narguments from evil. Now these two claims are vague and imprecise, and\ndifferent skeptical theists spell them out in different ways depending\non the argument from evil they are evaluating. Additionally, neither\nof these claims assume theism; they can be coherently\naccepted by theists, atheists, and agnostics alike. Nonetheless,\ntheists frequently appeal to skeptical theism in defense of theism.\nThus, sometimes authors use the term \u2018skeptical theism\u2019 to\nrefer to the conjunction of these kinds of conditionals with a\ncommitment to theism; sometimes it is just these kinds of conditionals\nwithout a commitment to theism. For clarity here, we\u2019ll use\n\u2018skeptical theism\u2019 and similar phrases to be neutral with\nregard to whether theism is true.\n\nSkeptical theism has a number of historical precedents (see Rudavsky\n2013). It was reintroduced into the contemporary literature in a 1984\npaper by Stephen Wykstra. Since then, a variety of authors have\ndeveloped and defended it including William Alston, Alvin Plantinga,\nPeter van Inwagen, Michael Bergmann, and Daniel Howard-Snyder. The\nliterature on the topic is extensive and technical at points.\nConsequently, this entry must be selective and simplifying. The\noverall aim is to provide a basic understanding of the key issues\nsurrounding skeptical theism, with extensive references for readers to\ndig into the meat of the debates.\n",
