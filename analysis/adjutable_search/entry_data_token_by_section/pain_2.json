    "main_text": "The common-sense conception of pain || Second thread: pain as subjective experience\n1.2 Second thread: pain as subjective experience\n\nThat pain is a subjective experience seems to be a truism. Given our\ncommon-sense understanding of pain, this seems to be the more dominant\nthread: instead of treating pains as objects of perceptual experience,\nit treats them as experiences themselves. Indeed it is this thread\nthat the official scientific definition of \u2018pain\u2019 picks up\nand emphasizes, which was first formulated in\u00a0 1979 by a\ncommittee organized by the International Association for the Study of\nPain (IASP), and has been, since then, widely accepted by the\nscientific community and\n clinicians:[1]\n\n\nPain: An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience\nassociated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in\nterms of such damage.\n\nNote: ... Pain is always subjective. Each individual learns\nthe application of the word through experiences related to injury in\nearly life. Biologists recognize that those stimuli which cause pain\nare liable to damage tissue. Accordingly, pain is that experience we\nassociate with actual or potential tissue damage. It is unquestionably\na sensation in a part or parts of the body, but it is also always\nunpleasant and therefore also an emotional experience. Experiences\nwhich resemble pain but are not unpleasant, e.g., pricking, should not\nbe called pain. Unpleasant abnormal experiences (dysesthesias) may\nalso be pain but are not necessarily so because, subjectively, they\nmay not have the usual sensory qualities of pain. Many people report\npain in the absence of tissue damage or any likely pathophysiological\ncause; usually this happens for psychological reasons. There is\nusually no way to distinguish their experience from that due to tissue\ndamage if we take the subjective report. If they regard their\nexperience as pain, and if they report it in the same ways as pain\ncaused by tissue damage, it should be accepted as pain. This\ndefinition avoids tying pain to the stimulus. Activity induced in the\nnociceptor and nociceptive pathways by a noxious stimulus is not pain,\nwhich is always a psychological state, even though we may well\nappreciate that pain most often has a proximate physical cause. (IASP\n2011 Web Edition, cf. IASP-Task-Force-On-Taxonomy 1994)\n\n\nLike other experiences as conscious episodes, pains are thought to be\nprivate, subjective, self-intimating, and the source of incorrigible\nknowledge. These elements can certainly be found in the IASP\ncharacterization, which also adds that pain experiences are\nunpleasant. Indeed, by emphasizing that pain is always a\n\u201cpsychological state\u201d the note warns against a conception\nof pain suggested by the first thread above.\n\nInterestingly, however, when we talk about pains as experiences, we\nalso, in the same breath, talk about feeling them as if these\nexperiences were also the object of some sort of inner perception,\nwhich suggests introspection. Indeed the discussion of privacy,\nsubjectivity, self-intimation, and incorrigibility naturally forces us\nto talk this way.\u00a0 These are paradigm features that many have\nthought mark the mental phenomena as such.\n\n\n\nPains are said to be private to their owners in the strong\nsense that no one else can epistemically access one\u2019s pain in\nthe way one has access to one\u2019s own pain, namely by feeling it\nand coming to know one is feeling it on that basis. This sharply\ncontrasts with the public nature of objects of standard perception,\nthat is, perception of one\u2019s immediate extramental environment\nincluding one\u2019s body. Let\u2019s call this\nexteroception, to contrast with introspection which\nis access to one\u2019s intra-mental activity. So, for instance, the\nvery same apple I see on the table can be seen by others in possibly\nthe exact same way I see it, so is not private in this sense.\n\nPains also seem to be subjective in the sense that their\nexistence depends on feeling them. There is an air of paradox when\nsomeone talks about unfelt pains. One is naturally tempted to say that\nif a pain is not being felt by its owner then it does not exist. Again\ncompare the subjectivity of pains to the \u2018objectivity\u2019 of\nthe objects of standard exteroception. The apple I see does not depend\non my perceiving it in order to exist: (pace Berkeley and\nphenomenalists) its existence is independent of my, or for that matter\nanyone else\u2019s, seeing it.\n\nNot only do people seem to have a special epistemic access to their\nown pains, they also seem to have a very special epistemic\nauthority with respect to their pain: they seem to be\nincorrigible, or even infallible, about their pains and pain\nreports. Necessarily, if I sincerely believe that I am in pain, then I\nam in pain. Conversely, if I feel pain, then I know that I am in pain.\nThis is the self-intimating aspect of pain experiences.\n\nIn short, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any room for a possible gap\nbetween the appearance of pain and being in pain (that is, no\nappearance/reality distinction is applicable to pain). As Kripke\nfamously put it:\n\n\nTo be in the same epistemic situation that would obtain if one had a\npain is to have a pain; to be in the same epistemic situation\nthat would obtain in the absence of pain is not to have a\npain\u2026. Pain \u2026 is not picked out by one of its accidental\nproperties; rather it is picked out by its immediate phenomenological\nquality\u2026. If any phenomenon is picked out in exactly the same\nway that we pick out pain, then that phenomenon is pain.\n(Kripke 1980, pp. 152\u201353)\n\n\nIf there is no appearance/reality distinction applicable to pain, then\nit seems that one cannot be mistaken about one\u2019s beliefs about\none\u2019s pain formed on the basis of feeling pain in the way one\ncan be mistaken about the existence and properties of the apple one\nsees. In the latter case, appearances can be misleading precisely\nbecause the perceptual appearance of an apple might not correspond to\nwhat the apple is like in reality. In apparent contrast to pain,\nnormal exteroception always involves the possibility of misperception,\nand thus miscategorization (that is, misapplication of concepts to the\nobjects of exteroception).\u00a0 Even with a healthy dose of\nskepticism about whether pain experiences (or, sensations in general)\nalways exhibit these features, it is clear that the strong and robust\n(almost definitional) association of these features with pain\nexperiences suffice to make pains puzzling and problematic \u2014 as\nwe will see shortly.\n\n\n",
