    "main_text": "\n\nTiantai is the name of a mountain and surrounding geographical\nlocation in China, literally meaning \u201cplatform of the\nsky\u201d, but the term is traditionally used to denote a particular\nschool of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism with historical connections to\nthat locale. In this article, the term \u201cTiantai\u201d will be\nused to refer to the philosophical ideas developed from the sixth to\neleventh centuries by this school, as expounded in the writings of its\nthree most representative figures: Tiantai Zhiyi (538\u2013597),\nJingxi Zhanran (711\u2013782) and Siming Zhili (960\u20131028).\n\nTo translate Tiantai\u2019s rather technical scholastic terminology\nand its typically Buddhist soteriological orientation into something\napproaching traditional philosophical categories, we can start by\nidentifying a few hashtag themes that are characteristic of Tiantai\nthinking. Tiantai is a thoroughgoing contextualism, regarding the\nontological status and identity of all entities as deriving entirely\nfrom their contexts, their relationships to other entities. It\nis a thoroughgoing holism, regarding these dispositive\nrelationships as incapable of definitive limitation to any finite\nsubset of what exists. It is a thoroughgoing monism,\nrejecting any notion of distinct ontological categories that are\nirreducible to one another. It is a theory of thoroughgoing\nimmanence, rejecting any possibility of any independently existing\ntranscendent realms entirely beyond what is present in immediate\nexperience. This involves a commitment to the\nclaims that all entities of any kind are impermanent,\nthat what each entity ultimately is is constitutively\nambiguous, and there exist no irreducible or\nprimary substances. Epistemologically this entails thoroughgoing\nskepticism about all unconditional claims, and thoroughgoing\nanti-realism. Ethically it implies a thoroughgoing renunciation of all\nfinite aims, as well as thoroughgoing repudiation of all determinate\nmoral rules, moral consequences, and moral virtues.\n\nBut all of these descriptions are potentially very misleading, since\nour understanding of each of these points must be thoroughly modified\nby the most characteristic premise of Tiantai thought of all, which\ndetermines the meaning we intend for the term\n\u201cthoroughgoing\u201d here: the idea of\n\u201cself-recontextualization\u201d. As we\u2019ll see in detail\nbelow, this is a thinking-through of the basic notion of universal\ncontextualization itself and its constitutive role in the construction\nof all identities, to the point of seeing it to entail the ambiguating\nof the identity not only of the contextualized but also of the\ncontextualizer. This notion brings with it a kind of turnaround\nwhereby the full expression of any element of experience, indeed the\nthorough consideration of any determinate entity at all, intrinsically\nentails its self-overcoming and self-negation, amounting to its\nreversal: it is found to include just what it had initially appeared\nto exclude. This turn of thought may be termed dialectical,\nbut in a way that differs from both Hegelian and Marxian notions of\ndialectics in that it is neither teleologically progressive nor\nhierarchical. It has roots in (1) indigenous Chinese interest in the\n\u201creversals\u201d observed in the cycles of nature,\nconceptualized according to the na\u00efve ancient generalization that\nwhen anything is pushed to its own extreme it will\n\u201creverse\u201d, that an increase in a thing\u2019s extension\nor intensity leads to its self-undermining (e,g., it keeps getting\ncolder until it gets coldest, and then it starts getting warmer), and\nin (2) the sophisticated ruminations on the nature of conditionality\ndeveloped in the Emptiness and Two Truths doctrines as expressed in\nIndian Buddhist logic. What this means is that \u201cthoroughgoing\ncontextualism\u201d will in Tiantai reverse into an\nassertion of the self-validation of every entity without exception,\nthat \u201cthoroughgoing holism\u201d will in Tiantai self-reverse\nalso into thoroughgoing individualism, \u201cthoroughgoing\nmonism\u201d also into thoroughgoing pluralism, \u201cthoroughgoing\nimmanentism\u201d also into thoroughgoing transcendentalism, along\nwith a claim that these two extremes are, when fully thought through,\nactually synonyms for one another. It will mean that for all finite\nconditional entities, exceptionless impermanence is seen to be also\nexceptionless eternalism, exceptionless anti-substantialism is seen to\nbe also exceptionless substantialism, exceptionless anti-realism is\nseen to be also exceptionless realism, again supplemented by a claim\nabout the interchangeability of these two seemingly opposed claims.\nSimilarly, thoroughgoing skepticism about all claims is seen to be\nalso a thoroughgoing \u201ctrivialism\u201d (the claim that all\npossible claims are true), thoroughgoing anti-realism also a\nfanatically absolute realism even for the most fleeting appearances,\nthoroughgoing renunciation of finite aims, moral rules, moral\nconsequences and moral virtues is seen to be also an exceptionless\nacceptance of all finite aims and the endorsement of all determinate\nmoral rules, consequences and virtues.\n\nWhen the dust from these turnarounds settles, Tiantai ends up with a\nunique view of the structure of reality: every event, function or\ncharacteristic occurring in any experience anywhere is the action of\nall sentient and insentient beings working together. Every instant of\nexperience is the whole of reality manifesting in this particular\nform, as this particular entity or experience. Each such\ninstant is however no mere accidental, dispensable form; rather, it is\nitself unconditional and ineradicable, is eternal and omnipresent.\nMoreover, this \u201cwhole of reality\u201d is irreducibly multiple\nand irreducibly unified at once, in the following way: all possible\nconflicting, contrasted and axiologically varied aspects are\nirrevocably present\u2014in the sense of\n\u201cfindable\u201d\u2014in and as each of these individual\ndeterminate totality-effects. Good and evil, delusion and\nenlightenment, Buddhahood and deviltry, are all \u201cinherently\nentailed\u201d in each and every event. These multiple entities are\nnot \u201csimply located\u201d even virtually or conceptually: the\n\u201cwhole\u201d which is the agent performing every experience is\nnot a collection of these various \u201cinherently entailed\u201d\nentities or qualities arrayed side by side, like coins in a pocket.\nRather, they are \u201cintersubsumptive\u201d. That is, any one of\nthem subsumes all the others, and yet, because of the view of what\n\u201csubsumption\u201d actually is, each is subsumed by each of the\nothers as well: all relation is subsumption, and all subsumption is\nintersubsumption. Each part is the whole, each quality subsumes all\nother qualities, and yet none are ever eradicable. A Buddha in the\nworld makes the world all Buddha, saturated in every locus with the\nquality \u201cBuddhahood\u201d; a devil in the world makes the world\nall devil, permeated with \u201cdeviltry\u201d. Both Buddha and\ndevil are always in the world. So every event in the world is always\nboth entirely Buddhahood and entirely deviltry.\nEvery moment of experience is always completely delusion, evil and\npain, through and through, and also completely enlightenment, goodness\nand joy, through and through.\n\nTraditional Buddhism gives a rather commonsensical account of sentient\nexperience: every moment of sentient experience is a sensory apparatus\nencountering an object, giving rise thereby to a particular moment of\ncontentful awareness. But in the Tiantai view, each of these\nthree\u2014sense organ, object, this moment of consciousness\u2014is\nitself the Absolute, the entirety of reality, expressed without\nremainder in the peculiar temporary form of sense organ, of object, of\nthis consciousness. Hence each moment of every being\u2019s\nexperience is redescribed, to paraphrase a canonical early Tiantai\nwork, as follows:\n\n\nThe absolute totality encounters the absolute totality, and the result\nis the arising of the absolute totality.\n(\u6cd5\u754c\u5c0d\u6cd5\u754c\u8d77\u6cd5\u754c)\n\n\nThe Absolute, the whole of reality, is one and eternal, always the\nsame and omnipresent, but it is also the kind of whole that divides\nfrom itself, encounters itself, arises anew each moment, engenders\nitself as the transient flux of each unique and individual\nmoment of experience of every sentient being.\n\nHow this view is established, and what its consequences are, is what\nis to be explained in this article.\n",
