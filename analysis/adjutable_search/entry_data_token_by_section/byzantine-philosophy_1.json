But there are many literary forms\nthat do not readily lend themselves to use in such contexts; these, then, will\nhave been cultivated for other reasons.\n\n\nOne such form is the dialogue. The philosophical dialogue endured\nthroughout the whole Byzantine era, even if perhaps it did not flourish\nas abundantly as in the contemporary West. By and large, it seems\npossible to divide the extant specimens into two subcategories: Plato\npastiche and Lucian pastiche. In the latter subcategory belongs the\nearly 12th-century satire Timarion, which offers some amusing\nmockery of contemporary or near-contemporary philosophy professors like\nMichael Psellos, John Italos, and Theodore of Smyrna. The elenctic\ndialogue in Plato\u2019s style seems to have been considered\nparticularly useful for polemical purposes. Many dialogues in this\nsubcategory have a more theological than philosophical content, but\nTheodore Prodromos\u2019 (c. 1100\u20131170) relatively good-humoured\nXenedemus, or, Predicables, and Nikephoros Gregoras\u2019\n(1293/94\u20131360/61) rather more virulent Phlorentius, or, On\nWisdom are two conspicuous exceptions. A particularly intriguing\nexample is Hermippus, or, On Astrology: this attempt at a\nreconciliation between the belief in astral influence over the natural\nworld and the Christian doctrines of divine providence and human free\nwill is one of three anonymous dialogues, probably from the\nearly 14th century, which have been variously attributed to Nikephoros\nGregoras, John Aktouarios and John Katrones (or Katrarios) (Hohlweg\n1995).\n\n\nPhilosophical treatises, vaguely defined as prose monologues on\nparticular themes arguing personal views, are found predominantly from\nthe three most philosophically productive periods (see section 1.1).\nThey were composed by numerous authors and for various purposes, some\nof them, no doubt, strictly pedagogical or scholarly; but we will here\nonly mention two examples of a slightly more topical and literary\ncharacter. The philosophical essays (Logoi) of Nikephoros\nChoumnos (c. 1250/55\u20131327) are written in a personal but hardly\noriginal style\u2014much in keeping with the views propounded in\nthem\u2014which does not always correspond to the author\u2019s\nprofessed ideal of clarity. Those of Theodore Metochites\n(S\u0113mei\u014dseis gn\u014dmikai, c. 1326) represent a\nfurther move in the direction of essays in the strict and narrow sense.\nInspired by Plutarch and anticipating Montaigne, Metochites seems to\nhave conceived of them as adding up to a \u2018self-portrait as a\nphilosopher\u2019, theorizing about, and obviously trying to put into\npractice, the proper style for philosophy.\n\n\nMetochites discussed philosophy in some of his orations\n(Logoi) and some of his hexameter poetry. Dodecasyllabic verse\nwas also put to use, notably by John Tzetzes (c. 1110\u20131180), who\nwrote a 1700-line paraphrase of Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge. The\nByzantines are also known for having enthusiastically cultivated the\nart of writing letters, in which they occasionally dealt with\nphilosophical questions (e.g., Michael Psellos, Letter to\nXiphilinos; Theodore Prodromos, On \u2018Great\u2019 and\n\u2018Small\u2019).\n\n\nTurning to those literary forms that can be assumed to have had an\neducational or scholarly purpose, the kind of texts that bring us most\nclosely into contact with the daily reality of philosophy classes are\nundoubtedly the collections of questions and answers that have been\nhanded down from the 1040s to 1070s, the most well-known of which is\nperhaps the Quaestiones quodlibetales by John Italos (c.\n1025\u2013after 1082).\n\n\nA very well-represented philosophical genre is the compendium. Most of\nthese cover only a part of philosophy, like the logic compendium by\nJohn Chortasmenos (c. 1370\u20131436/37), the Quadrivium by\nGeorge Pachymeres (1242\u2013c. 1310), or the Logic and\nQuadrivium by the anonymous of 1007 (\u2018Anonymus\nHeiberg\u2019). Some of them attempt universality, like\nPachymeres\u2019 paraphrase-compendium of Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophical writings (the Philosophia), or indeed Joseph\nRhakendytes\u2019 (died 1330) Encyclopedia, which also\nincluded rhetoric and medicine. As to the question of why the\nByzantines produced compendia, there can be little doubt that they\nmainly did so for educational purposes. Most of the compendia are\nwholly or partly concerned with logic, the most basic subject in the\nphilosophical curriculum. They do not contain detailed comments for\npeople already initiated in the subtleties of Aristotelian logic;\nrather, they are introductory texts that do not presuppose any\nsignificant knowledge of the subject. \n\n\nA large proportion of the Byzantine philosophical texts consist of\ncommentaries on ancient authorities\u2014in fact, almost invariably\nAristotle. The only Plato commentary from the period after c. 730 is\nGeorge Pachymeres\u2019 supplement to Proclus on the last 24 pages of\nthe Parmenides. These commentaries are not, however, all made\naccording to the same pattern. A few main categories can be discerned,\nand even within some of these categories, there is considerable\nvariation. The most basic type of commentary is (a) simply a\ncollection of scholia or notes, usually transmitted in the margin of\nthe Aristotelian text. The individual scholia of such a collection may\nbe the work of an indeterminate number of scholars. An example is\nArethas\u2019 scholia on the Isagoge, which draws on many\nearlier commentaries, some of which are now lost. It is Arethas\u2019\ncommentary in the sense that he copied, and possibly collected and\nedited, the scholia in his Aristotle manuscript; in terms of\nauthorship, however, it is a product of mass collaboration. Next, (b)\nthe collection may be provided with an introduction dealing with\npreliminary questions. Rules for the composition of such introductions\nwere established by the Alexandrian commentators on Porphyry and\nAristotle in the 5th\u20137th centuries. The best examples in the\nperiod after c. 730 of collections of scholia with introductions are\nprobably the commentaries on Porphyry\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s\nlogical works by Leo Magentenos (late 12th or early to mid-13th\ncentury). Further, (c) the notes can be integrated in a running\ncommentary, so as to form a quasi-independent whole, each new section\nintroduced by a lemma from the text. This is the standard type of\nso-called \u2018exegetical commentary\u2019 typified by Alexander of\nAphrodisias and cultivated in Byzantine times by Michael of Ephesus\nand Eustratios of Nicaea in the early 12th century. (d) The\nAlexandrian 6th\u20137th-century commentaries are sometimes divided\ninto more or less even chunks (praxeis), each starting with a\nlemma followed by a general explanation of its meaning\n(the\u014dria), and then proceeding to comments on particular\npoints (lexis). While there are no clear-cut examples of this\ntype of commentary from Middle or Late Byzantium, its influence can be\ntraced, for instance, in Eustratios\u2019 commentary on Posterior\nAnalytics 2. (e) An even more advanced form is represented by\nGeorge (Gennadios) Scholarios\u2019 commentaries, which, in the\nmanner of contemporary Latin works, are divided into\n\u2018lessons\u2019 (anagn\u014dseis = lectiones),\neach of which is subdivided into an introduction, a broad analysis of\nthe text into sections, a detailed analysis with interpretations of\nparticular points, and finally \u2018investigations\u2019\n(z\u0113t\u0113mata = quaestiones).\n\n\nThe genre of Aristotelian paraphrase, that is, adaptations in which\nAristotle\u2019s text is rephrased, reorganized, and amplified or\npruned, as need be, in order to make it more easily understood, was\nallegedly invented by Themistius in the mid-4th century, revived by\nMichael Psellos in the mid-11th century, and further developed by\nSophonias and others in the late 13th to early 14th centuries. It is a\ncurious fact that the only periods from which we have dated paraphrases\nof Aristotelian works are precisely these three. In addition, there is\nan Arabic paraphrase that may have been based on a lost Greek\nparaphrase, which must in that case have been composed in the late 6th\nor 7th century (D\u2019Ancona 2001). Works of uncertain date include\nthe paraphrase of the Nicomachean Ethics printed in\nCAG 19 as the work of Heliodorus of Prusa (perhaps mid-14th cent.: see\nsection 1.3). Sophonias consciously tried to blend elements of\n\u2018exegetical commentary\u2019 with his paraphrase of the De\nanima, in order to be able to preserve more of Aristotle\u2019s\noriginal wording. George Pachymeres effected another kind of hybrid\nparaphrase by organizing his Philosophia like a compendium,\nwhich deals with a given subject, rather than a commentary or a\nparaphrase, which deals with a given text.\n\n\nNot only Aristotle\u2019s works were paraphrased; there are\nChristianizing paraphrases of Proclus\u2019 Three Treatises\non Providence (the latter have since been lost in the original\nGreek) by Isaac Sebastokrator (1093\u2013after 1152) and of\nEpictetus\u2019 Encheiridion (no fewer than three of them,\nall of uncertain date; one of them, composed and provided with a\ncommentary no later than 960, when the oldest manuscript was copied,\nseems to have enjoyed considerable popularity in the 13th and 14th\ncenturies: Boter 1999, 197\u2013256). One may also note a paraphrase\nof Ptolemy\u2019s Tetrabiblos sometimes ascribed to Proclus,\nwritten before the end of the 10th century (Byd\u00e9n 2003,\n352).\n",
