Meritocracy is not a utilitarian theory, and\nfocused utilitarian objections have been lodged against it (see, e.g.,\nDurlauf 2008).\n\nMeritocracy strikes some as insufficiently attentive to the needs of\nthe poorest citizens; it is not a prioritarian theory (Wilson 2003).\n(Although if the poor are underpaid given their merit, and the rich\nare overpaid, as many meritocrats claim, then meritocracy will do\nbetter than the status quo from the prioritarian point-of-view.\nMeritocratic equal opportunity will also have an enormous effect.)\nRichard Arneson (1999) rejects Rawls\u2019s Fair Equality of\nOpportunity\n (\u00a75.1)\n as an unacceptable \u201ccompromise with meritocracy\u201d because\nit constrains the prioritarian Difference Principle.\n\nSome scholars make what is essentially an empirical argument, denying\nthe existence of an elite class of citizens on which meritocratic\ngovernance can rely (Gunn 2019; Hannon 2022; Mend\u00e9z 2022; Reiss\n2019). If the \u201cmeritocrats\u201d are not more knowledgeable\nthan common people, or if they suffer from unique and damaging biases,\nthen, whatever its theoretical virtues, meritocracy cannot be\noperationalized.\n",
