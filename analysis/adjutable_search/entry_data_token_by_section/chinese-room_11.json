    "main_text": "The Larger Philosophical Issues || Syntax and Semantics\n5.1 Syntax and Semantics\n\nSearle believes the Chinese Room argument supports a larger point,\nwhich explains the failure of the Chinese Room to produce\nunderstanding. Searle argued that programs implemented by computers\nare just syntactical. Computer operations are \u201cformal\u201d in\nthat they respond only to the physical form of the strings of symbols,\nnot to the meaning of the symbols. Minds on the other hand have states\nwith meaning, mental contents. We associate meanings with the words or\nsigns in language. We respond to signs because of their meaning, not\njust their physical appearance. In short, we understand. But, and\naccording to Searle this is the key point, \u201cSyntax is not by\nitself sufficient for, nor constitutive of, semantics.\u201d So\nalthough computers may be able to manipulate syntax to produce\nappropriate responses to natural language input, they do not\nunderstand the sentences they receive or output, for they cannot\nassociate meanings with the words.\n\nSearle (1984) presents a three premise argument that because syntax is\nnot sufficient for semantics, programs cannot produce minds.\n\nPrograms are purely formal (syntactic).\nHuman minds have mental contents (semantics).\nSyntax by itself is neither constitutive of, nor sufficient for,\nsemantic content.\nTherefore, programs by themselves are not constitutive of nor\nsufficient for minds.\n\n\nThe Chinese Room thought experiment itself is the support for the\nthird premise. The claim that syntactic manipulation is not sufficient\nfor meaning or thought is a significant issue, with wider implications\nthan AI, or attributions of understanding. Prominent theories of mind\nhold that human cognition generally is computational. In one form, it\nis held that thought involves operations on symbols in virtue of their\nphysical properties. On an alternative connectionist account, the\ncomputations are on \u201csubsymbolic\u201d states. If Searle is\nright, not only Strong AI but also these main approaches to\nunderstanding human cognition are misguided.\n\nAs we have seen, Searle holds that the Chinese Room scenario shows\nthat one cannot get semantics from syntax alone. In a symbolic logic\nsystem, a kind of artificial language, rules are given for syntax. A\nsemantics, if any, comes later. The logician specifies the basic\nsymbol set and some rules for manipulating strings to produce new\nones. These rules are purely syntactic \u2013 they are applied to\nstrings of symbols solely in virtue of their syntax or form. A\nsemantics, if any, for the symbol system must be provided separately.\nAnd if one wishes to show that interesting additional relationships\nhold between the syntactic operations and semantics, such as that the\nsymbol manipulations preserve truth, one must provide sometimes\ncomplex meta-proofs to show this. So on the face of it, semantics is\nquite independent of syntax for artificial languages, and one cannot\nget semantics from syntax alone. \u201cFormal symbols by themselves\ncan never be enough for mental contents, because the symbols, by\ndefinition, have no meaning (or interpretation, or semantics) except\ninsofar as someone outside the system gives it to them\u201d (Searle\n1989, 45).\n\nSearle\u2019s identification of meaning with interpretation in this\npassage is important. Searle\u2019s point is clearly true of the\ncausally inert formal systems of logicians. A semantic interpretation\nhas to be given to those symbols by a logician. When we move from\nformal systems to computational systems, the situation is more\ncomplex. As many of Searle\u2019s critics (e.g. Cole 1984, Dennett\n1987, Boden 1988, and Chalmers 1996) have noted, a computer running a\nprogram is not the same as \u201csyntax alone\u201d. A computer is\nan enormously complex electronic causal system. State changes in the\nsystem are physical. One can interpret the physical states,\ne.g. voltages, as syntactic 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s, but the intrinsic\nreality is electronic and the syntax is \u201cderived\u201d, a\nproduct of interpretation. The states are syntactically specified by\nprogrammers, but when implemented in a running machine they are\nelectronic states of a complex causal system embedded in the real\nworld. This is quite different from the abstract formal systems that\nlogicians study. Dennett notes that no \u201ccomputer program by\nitself\u201d (Searle\u2019s language) \u2013 e.g. a program lying\non a shelf \u2013 can cause anything, even simple addition, let alone\nmental states. The program must be running. Chalmers (1996) offers a\nparody in which it is reasoned that recipes are syntactic, syntax is\nnot sufficient for crumbliness, cakes are crumbly, so implementation\nof a recipe is not sufficient for making a cake. Implementation makes\nall the difference; an abstract entity (recipe, program) determines\nthe causal powers of a physical system embedded in the larger causal\nnexus of the world. \n\nDennett (1987) sums up the issue: \u201cSearle\u2019s view, then,\ncomes to this: take a material object (any material object) that does\nnot have the power of causing mental phenomena; you cannot turn it in\nto an object that does have the power of producing mental phenomena\nsimply by programming it \u2013 reorganizing the conditional\ndependencies of transitions between its states.\u201d Dennett\u2019s\nview is the opposite: programming \u201cis precisely what could give\nsomething a mind\u201d. But Dennett claims that in fact it is\n\u201cempirically unlikely that the right sorts of programs can be\nrun on anything but organic, human brains\u201d (325\u20136).\n\nA further related complication is that it is not clear that computers\nperform syntactic operations in quite the same sense that a human does\n\u2013 it is not clear that a computer understands syntax or\nsyntactic operations. A computer does not know that it is manipulating\n1\u2019s and 0\u2019s. A computer does not recognize that its binary\ndata strings have a certain form, and thus that certain syntactic\nrules may be applied to them, unlike the man inside the Chinese Room.\nInside a computer, there is nothing that literally reads input data,\nor that \u201cknows\u201d what symbols are. Instead, there are\nmillions of transistors that change states. A sequence of voltages\ncauses operations to be performed. We humans may choose to interpret\nthese voltages as binary numerals and the voltage changes as syntactic\noperations, but a computer does not interpret its operations as\nsyntactic or any other way. So perhaps a computer does not need to\nmake the move from syntax to semantics that Searle objects to; it\nneeds to move from complex causal connections to semantics.\nFurthermore, perhaps any causal system is describable as\nperforming syntactic operations \u2013 if we interpret a light square\nas logical \u201c0\u201d and a dark square as logical\n\u201c1\u201d, then a kitchen toaster may be described as a\ndevice that rewrites logical \u201c0\u201ds as logical\n\u201c1\u201ds. But there is no philosophical problem about getting\nfrom syntax to breakfast. \n\nIn the 1990s, Searle began to use considerations related to these to\nargue that computational views are not just false, but lack a clear\nsense. Computation, or syntax, is \u201cobserver-relative\u201d, not\nan intrinsic feature of reality: \u201c\u2026you can assign a\ncomputational interpretation to anything\u201d (Searle 2002b, p. 17),\neven the molecules in the paint on the wall. Since nothing is\nintrinsically computational, one cannot have a scientific theory that\nreduces the mental, which is not observer-relative, to computation,\nwhich is. \u201cComputation exists only relative to some agent or\nobserver who imposes a computational interpretation on some\nphenomenon. This is an obvious point. I should have seen it ten years\nago, but I did not.\u201d (Searle 2002b, p.17, originally published\n1993).\n\nCritics note that walls are not computers; unlike a wall, a computer\ngoes through state-transitions that are counterfactually described by\na program (Chalmers 1996, Block 2002, Haugeland 2002). In his 2002\npaper, Block addresses the question of whether a wall is a computer\n(in reply to Searle\u2019s charge that anything that maps onto a\nformal system is a formal system, whereas minds are quite different).\nBlock denies that whether or not something is a computer depends\nentirely on our interpretation. Block notes that Searle ignores the\ncounterfactuals that must be true of an implementing system. Haugeland\n(2002) makes the similar point that an implementation will be a causal\nprocess that reliably carries out the operations \u2013 and they must\nbe the right causal powers. Block concludes that Searle\u2019s\narguments fail, but he concedes that they \u201cdo succeed in\nsharpening our understanding of the nature of intentionality and its\nrelation to computation and representation\u201d (78).\n\nRey (2002) also addresses Searle\u2019s arguments that syntax and\nsymbols are observer-relative properties, not physical. Searle infers\nthis from the fact that syntactic properties (e.g. being a logical\n\u201c1\u201d)are not defined in physics; however Rey holds that it\ndoes not follow that they are observer-relative. Rey argues that\nSearle also misunderstands what it is to realize a program. Rey\nendorses Chalmers\u2019 reply to Putnam: a realization is not just a\nstructural mapping, but involves causation, supporting\ncounterfactuals. \u201cThis point is missed so often, it bears\nrepeating: the syntactically specifiable objects over which\ncomputations are defined can and standardly do possess a semantics;\nit\u2019s just that the semantics is not involved in the\nspecification.\u201d States of a person have their semantics in\nvirtue of computational organization and their causal relations to the\nworld. Rey concludes: Searle \u201csimply does not consider the\nsubstantial resources of functionalism and Strong AI.\u201d (222) A\nplausibly detailed story would defuse negative conclusions drawn from\nthe superficial sketch of the system in the Chinese Room.\n\nJohn Haugeland (2002) argues that there is a sense in which a\nprocessor must intrinsically understand the commands in the programs\nit runs: it executes them in accord with the specifications.\n\u201cThe only way that we can make sense of a computer as executing\na program is by understanding its processor as responding to the\nprogram prescriptions as meaningful\u201d (385). Thus operation\nsymbols have meaning to a system. Haugeland goes on to draw a\ndistinction between narrow and wide system. He argues that data can\nhave semantics in the wide system that includes representations of\nexternal objects produced by transducers. In passing, Haugeland makes\nthe unusual claim, argued for elsewhere, that genuine intelligence and\nsemantics presuppose \u201cthe capacity for a kind of commitment in\nhow one lives\u201d which is non-propositional \u2013 that is, love\n(cp. Steven Spielberg\u2019s 2001 film Artificial Intelligence:\nAI). \n\nTo Searle\u2019s claim that syntax is observer-relative, that the\nmolecules in a wall might be interpreted as implementing the Wordstar\nprogram (an early word processing program) because \u201cthere is\nsome pattern in the molecule movements which is isomorphic with the\nformal structure of Wordstar\u201d (Searle 1990b, p. 27), Haugeland\ncounters that \u201cthe very idea of a complex syntactical token\n\u2026 presupposes specified processes of writing and\nreading\u2026.\u201d The tokens must be systematically producible\nand retrievable. So no random isomorphism or pattern somewhere (e.g.\non some wall) is going to count, and hence syntax is not\nobserver-relative.\n\nWith regard to the question of whether one can get semantics from\nsyntax, William Rapaport has for many years argued for\n\u201csyntactic semantics\u201d, a view in which understanding is a\nspecial form of syntactic structure in which symbols (such as Chinese\nwords) are linked to concepts, themselves represented syntactically.\nOthers believe we are not there yet. AI futurist (The Age of\nSpiritual Machines) Ray Kurzweil holds in a 2002 follow-up book\nthat it is red herring to focus on traditional symbol-manipulating\ncomputers. Kurzweil agrees with Searle that existent computers do not\nunderstand language \u2013 as evidenced by the fact that they\ncan\u2019t engage in convincing dialog. But that failure does not\nbear on the capacity of future computers based on different\ntechnology. Kurzweil claims that Searle fails to understand that\nfuture machines will use \u201cchaotic emergent methods that are\nmassively parallel\u201d. This claim appears to be similar to that of\nconnectionists, such as Andy Clark, and the position taken by the\nChurchlands in their 1990 Scientific American article.\n\nApart from Haugeland\u2019s claim that processors understand program\ninstructions, Searle\u2019s critics can agree that computers no more\nunderstand syntax than they understand semantics, although, like all\ncausal engines, a computer has syntactic descriptions. And while it is\noften useful to programmers to treat the machine as if it performed\nsyntactic operations, it is not always so: sometimes the characters\nprogrammers use are just switches that make the machine do something,\nfor example, make a given pixel on the computer display turn red, or\nmake a car transmission shift gears. Thus it is not clear that Searle\nis correct when he says a digital computer is just \u201ca device\nwhich manipulates symbols\u201d. Computers are complex causal\nengines, and syntactic descriptions are useful in order to structure\nthe causal interconnections in the machine. AI programmers face many\ntough problems, but one can hold that they do not have to get\nsemantics from syntax. If they are to get semantics, they must get it\nfrom causality.\n\nTwo main approaches have developed that explain meaning in terms of\ncausal connections. The internalist approaches, such as Schank\u2019s\nand Rapaport\u2019s conceptual representation approaches, and also\nConceptual Role Semantics, hold that a state of a physical system gets\nits semantics from causal connections to other states of the same\nsystem. Thus a state of a computer might represent \u201ckiwi\u201d\nbecause it is connected to \u201cbird\u201d and\n\u201cflightless\u201d nodes, and perhaps also to images of\nprototypical kiwis. The state that represents the property of being\n\u201cflightless\u201d might get its content from a\nNegation-operator modifying a representation of \u201ccapable of\nairborne self-propulsion\u201d, and so forth, to form a vast\nconnected conceptual network, a kind of mental dictionary.\n\nExternalist\n approaches developed by Dennis Stampe, Fred Dretske, Hilary Putnam,\nJerry Fodor, Ruth Millikan, and others, hold that states of a physical\nsystem get their content through causal connections to the external\nreality they represent. Thus, roughly, a system with a KIWI concept is\none that has a state it uses to represent the presence of kiwis in the\nexternal environment. This kiwi-representing state can be any state\nthat is appropriately causally connected to the presence of kiwis.\nDepending on the system, the kiwi representing state could be a state\nof a brain, or of an electrical device such as a computer, or even of\na hydraulic system. The internal representing state can then in turn\nplay a causal role in the determining the behavior of the system. For\nexample, Rey (1986) endorses an indicator semantics along the lines of\nthe work of Dennis Stampe (1977) and Fodor\u2019s\nPsychosemantics. These semantic theories that locate content\nor meaning in appropriate causal relations to the world fit well with\nthe Robot Reply. A computer in a robot body might have just the causal\nconnections that could allow its inner syntactic states to have the\nsemantic property of representing states of things in its\nenvironment.\n\nThus there are at least two families of theories (and marriages of the\ntwo, as in Block 1986) about how semantics might depend upon causal\nconnections. Both of these attempt to provide accounts that are\nsubstance neutral: states of suitably organized causal systems can\nhave content, no matter what the systems are made of. On these\ntheories a computer could have states that have meaning. It is not\nnecessary that the computer be aware of its own states and know that\nthey have meaning, nor that any outsider appreciate the meaning of the\nstates. On either of these accounts meaning depends upon the (possibly\ncomplex) causal connections, and digital computers are systems\ndesigned to have states that have just such complex causal\ndependencies. It should be noted that Searle does not subscribe to\nthese theories of semantics. Instead, Searle\u2019s discussions of\nlinguistic meaning have often centered on the notion of\nintentionality.\n",
