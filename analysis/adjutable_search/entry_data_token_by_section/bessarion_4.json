    "main_text": "Works || The In calumniatorem Platonis\n2.3 The In calumniatorem Platonis\n\nGeorge of Trebizond\u2019s resentment towards Bessarion was one of\nthe driving forces behind the Comparatio philosophorum Platonis et\nAristotelis (around 1458), in which George bitterly attacked\nPlato, a philosopher for whom the Cardinal\u2019s preference was\nnotorious. In three books George attacked Plato as ignorant, impious\nand vicious, while celebrating the perfect wisdom, piety and virtue of\nAristotle. This kind of work, a comparison of the respective merits of\nPlato and Aristotle, especially in religious matters, was not uncommon\nin the Byzantine milieu, and Gemistus Pletho had composed his\nown comparatio at the time of the Council of Florence:\nPletho\u2019s booklet, written in Greek and therefore little read,\ncelebrated the piety of Platonic philosophy in an attempt to expose\nthe frail Aristotelian foundation of Scholasticism. George\u2019s\ncomparatio was by contrast intended to reinforce the role of\nAristotle as authority of reference for Christian theology, to the\nextent of making the Stagirite aware of dogmas such as Trinity and\noccasionally placing him above even Thomas Aquinas. George\u2019s\ncomparatio had an apocalyptic subtext, made explicit in the\nfinal pages of the work, in which the coming of a fourth\nPlato\u2014the second and the third were respectively Epicurus and\nMohammed\u2014is connected to the fall of the Byzantine empire, and\ncharacterized as a threat to the Latin West. The unnamed fourth Plato\nwas possibly either Pletho or Bessarion himself.\n\nGeorge\u2019s Comparatio was immediately perceived as\ndangerous by Bessarion, who needed to respond to it in order to\npreserve his reputation and that of Plato. If Plato was perceived as\nimpious, so too was the Cardinal by association. With the help of\nseveral members of his circle, Bessarion produced over the course of\nabout ten years his masterpiece: the In calumniatorem\nPlatonis (Against the Slanderer of Plato).\n\nThe preparation of the\nwork required several adjustments, both formal and theoretical. From a\nformal point of view, Bessarion realized that a work written in Greek,\nas the In calumniatorem initially was, would not have had the\ndesired impact. He therefore translated the work into Latin, and in\norder to make it stylistically appealing engaged a skilled Latinist,\nhis secretary Niccol\u00f2 Perotti, to revise the text.\nPerotti\u2019s re-elaboration made the work more accessible and\nelegant, though he occasionally struggled to do justice to the\nphilosophical concepts contained within.\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, Bessarion was interested in a\ndifferent kind of revision. Around 1457, when he was involved in a\ndebate on nature and art in an epistolary exchange with Theodore Gaza,\nBessarion had initially argued, like his master Pletho, that Plato and\nAristotle were irreconcilably opposed. Yet, the Cardinal changed this\nposition, after coming across a treatise\u2014now lost\u2014on the\nsame topic by George of Trebizond: in his own subsequent\nbooklet\u2014the De natura et arte\u2014destined to become\nthe sixth book of the In calumniatorem Platonis, Bessarion\nembraced a conciliatory view modeled on the approach of late-antique\ncommentator Simplicius. This interpretation\u2014which is adopted\nthroughout the In calumniatorem\u2014cast Aristotle as a\nnatural philosopher, and Plato as a theologian, thus explaining the\napparent disagreement between the two authors as merely a question of\ndifferent subject matter and of different levels of reality. This\nexegetical move allowed Bessarion to avoid openly attacking Aristotle,\nwhile implicitly maintaining the superiority of Plato, in particular\nas an external aid for Christian faith. It also allowed him to avoid\ncontrasts with Aristotelians in the Roman curia, and to rely on\nScholastic authorities such as Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas to\nmeet his interpretative goals.\n\nThis arsenal of sources was crucial for exposing George\u2019s scarce\nknowledge of Aristotelian philosophy and tradition, and therefore the\nunreliability of his praise of the Stagirite\u2019s alleged piety:\nthis problem is the subject of the third book of the In\ncalumniatorem Platonis, which was composed at a later stage,\nmainly relying on material provided by the Dominican theologian\nGiovanni Gatti (d. ante 1484). Finally, by defending the\nagreement between Plato and Aristotle, Bessarion could also avoid any\nassociation with Gemistus Pletho, whose ambiguous religious reputation\ncould have tainted the Cardinal.\n\nThe In calumniatorem is divided into six books: books one, two\nand four mirror the three books of George\u2019s\nComparatio.\n Book one focuses on proving Plato\u2019s wisdom, in spite of the\nelusiveness of his style and the dialogical structure of his works,\nagainst George\u2019s claim that he was ignorant. After listing\nauthors who praised Plato above Aristotle\u2014mainly Cicero and\nAugustine, and several Fathers of the Church\u2014Bessarion discusses\nthe apparent absence of certain subjects in Plato\u2019s works by\ninvoking the Pythagorean practice of secrecy. Yet, the Cardinal also\ndemonstrates that Plato was perfectly trained in all the disciplines,\nand offered an alternative encyclopedia of wisdom to the Aristotelian\none.\n\nThe second book is the closest to the Byzantine tradition of the\ncomparatio, and addresses the problem of Plato\u2019s and\nAristotle\u2019s piety. Taking exegeses from authors like Plotinus,\nProclus, the Ps.-Dionysius, Simplicius, and many others, Bessarion\ncounter-analyzes the different subjects at the center of\nGeorge\u2019s invective, suggesting that Plato offered theorizations\nof decisive topics such as creation, soul and matter that were more\nakin to Christian dogma. Bessarion resolved embarrassing impasses in\nPlato\u2019s philosophy, such as the doctrine of matter and the\ndoctrine of the metasomatosis as presented in the\nTimaeus, by employing elaborate distinctions in the first\ncase, and allegorical explanation in the second, in the process making\nthem acceptable to Christian readers. Again, Bessarion repeatedly\ninsists on the only apparent disagreement between Plato and Aristotle:\nby recovering another argument from Simplicius, he claims that the\nStagirite attacked the words, and not the meaning of Plato\u2019s\ndoctrines, so as to preserve them from distortions and\nmanipulations. Aristotle, Bessarion claims, did the same with\nParmenides and Melissus, who spoke as theologians no less than\nPlato.\n\nThe third book, as indicated above, reviews a number of problematic\nissues in George of Trebizond\u2019s treatment of Aristotle. Lighter\ntopics\u2014such as those related to sacrifices, and the reliance on\npoets and women\u2014give way to more complex issues, such as\nAristotle\u2019s purported knowledge of Trinitarian dogma, his views\non the immortality of the soul, and the place of providence in\nPeripatetic cosmology.  Particularly important here are the chapters\ncentered on the impossibility of the individual immortality of the\nsoul in via Aristotelis, since it contrasts with the eternity\nof the world defended in On the Heavens. Bessarion,\nconversely, finds both Averroes\u2019 and Alexander of\nAphrodisias\u2019 interpretations of the soul acceptable according to\nthe Aristotelian tenets, despite their contrast with the Christian\nfaith.\n\nThe fourth book deals with the problem of the virtue of Plato. Relying\non Ps.-Dionysius, Bessarion offers a spiritual interpretation of\nlove\u2014as described in the Symposium and in the\nPhaedrus\u2014in radical contrast with the sexual one\npostulated by George. In a different section Bessarion employs\nHerodotus\u2019s comparative method to justify the common use of\nwomen advocated by Plato in the Republic. Additionally,\nBessarion defuses George\u2019s millenarian prophecy about the fourth\nPlato by arguing that the fall of the Greek Empire was due to an\nunescapable cyclical decline that the adoption of Plato\u2019s\ndoctrines would have forestalled. In the final chapter of the book,\nBessarion rebukes George for his hypocrisy, since he praised Plato\nwhen he translated the Parmenides and the Laws.\n\nGeorge\u2019s translation of the Laws is the primary target\nof the fifth book, which contains a list of the errors\u2014actual\nand alleged\u2014made by Trebizond in his edition. The goal of this\nchapter is to prove George\u2019s incompetence in Platonic\nphilosophy, which in turn further proves the unreliability of his\naccusations against Plato. Yet, a peculiar concern with the\ntranslation of Platonic works runs throughout the entire In\ncalumniatorem: Bessarion was aware that Latin Europeans\u2019\nscarce knowledge of Plato might have inclined them to listen to George\nof Trebizond. Bessarion\u2019s practice of offering in his work\ntranslations of Platonic texts, accompanied by alternative exegeses to\nthose offered by George\u2014was intended to correct this knowledge\ngap in the Western world. Bessarion also presented to his Latin\nreaders Aristotelian authors, such as Alexander of Aphrodisias, who\nhad until then limited circulation in the Latin world, but whose\ninterpretations of Aristotle placed the Stagirite in contradiction\nwith Christian dogma. These insertions were part of Bessarion\u2019s\nstrategy for exposing the religious limits of Aristotelian philosophy,\nso providing implicit support for the notion that Plato could serve as\na better external aid for true faith, in the tradition of the Church\nFathers, and of Greek theologians such as Eusebius of Cesarea and\nTheodore Metochites.\n\nThe sixth book of the In calumniatorem, the above-mentioned\nDe natura et arte, is the exegesis of a passage from the\nsecond book of the Aristotelian Physics. Written before the\nother books composing the In calumniatorem, it is the only\none in which Bessarion openly names George as his adversary\nand\u2014as stated above\u2014is the first work in which Bessarion\nexpresses conciliaristic views about Plato and Aristotle. In this\nsense the De natura et arte represented a sort of\n\u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for the magnum opus applied to\na single exegetical problem, which had nonetheless significant\nimplications for crucial subjects (such as the doctrine of Ideas and\ndivine causality in the world).\n",
