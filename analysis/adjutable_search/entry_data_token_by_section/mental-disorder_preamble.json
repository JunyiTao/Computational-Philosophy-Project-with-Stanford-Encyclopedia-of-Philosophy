    "main_text": "\n\nMental disorder (earlier entitled \u201cillness\u201d or\n\u201cdisease\u201d), is ascribed to deviations from normal\nthoughts, reasoning, feelings, attitudes, and actions that are by\ntheir subjects, or by others, considered socially or personally\ndysfunctional and apt for treatment. Schizophrenia, depression,\nobsessive-compulsive disorder, substance abuse, and mania are\nexamples. The concept of mental disorder plays a role in many domains,\nincluding medicine, social sciences such as psychology and\nanthropology, and the humanities, including literature and philosophy.\nPhilosophical discussions are the primary focus of the present entry,\nwhich differs from the entry on Philosophy of Psychiatry in noting\nseveral different approaches\u2014not only those of the philosophy of\nscience and mind, but also those arising from phenomenological and\nsocial theory traditions.\n\nAs a category, mental disorder is not well fitted to the part it plays\nin contemporary psychiatry, since it is often misunderstood, and\nvariously interpreted. Although widely judged to be forms of disorder,\nconditions such as those listed above have not all always been so\nunderstood (Porter 2002). Even when deemed to be disorder, moreover,\nthat status has frequently indicated ethical, as much as other\ndeficiency (Irwin 2013). Such reminders direct our attention to\ncontemporary medical psychiatry\u2019s sometimes uncompromisingly\nneurobiological, and avowedly value-free \u201cmedical model\u201d,\nwith its incumbent analogies and assumptions, and to the general\nquestion of how the taxa of psychiatric classifications are to be\nviewed as objects of natural science. This model has received\nintensive and continuing philosophical analysis and critique,\nincluding by those denying these conditions are deficiencies at all.\nAnd along with issues arising from cognitive psychology and the\nneurosciences, such foundational matters make up much of the following\nentry. Because of their focus on ideas central to the philosophy of\nmind and ethics, such as the relation of mind to body, responsibility,\nagency and identity, analyses of mental disorder have extensive\nimplications for those fields. As clinical phenomena, they also\nreflect an inescapable, everyday, societal reality, giving theoretical\ninquiries additionally urgent practical, moral, and legal,\nimplications.\n",
