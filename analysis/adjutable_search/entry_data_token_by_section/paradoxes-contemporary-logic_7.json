According to him,\nnumber-theoretic induction and the axiom of choice constitute\nindependent intuitions, truly synthetic a priori judgements. He then\nargues against Russell\u2019s logical definition of natural numbers\nas those numbers which belong to all recurrent classes (those\nclasses which contain 0 and are closed under successor). His objection\nis that the definition is not admissible since it refers essentially\nto a totality to which the class to be defined belongs\u2014the\ndefinition is impredicative\u2014and hence it is to be\nregarded as circular. But, according to Poincar\u00e9,\nmathematical objects do not exist without a proper\ndefinition, and a proper definition must be predicative,\ni.e., it must avoid vicious circles; Poincar\u00e9 thus\nsomewhat extended Richard\u2019s diagnosis.\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s views evolved over the years and in the debate\nwith Russell. In the later period, he advanced a novel approach to\npredicativity, which, though informally sketched, is suggestive of\nlater developments in definability and proof theory (see Feferman\n1964, Heinzmann 1985). He no longer insisted on the vicious\ncircularity of the definition involved in the contradictions; instead,\nhe held the view that a predicative classification is\ncharacterized by invariance, i.e., that it cannot be affected by\nthe introduction of new elements; by contrast, impredicative notions\nare subject to constant modification whenever new elements are\nintroduced.\n\nIn the light of contemporary logic, Poincar\u00e9 is hinting at some\nform of absoluteness or invariance under extension (that will\nbe made precise by Kreisel 1960 via model theory and recursion\ntheory): his ideas will inspire the non-ramified approach to the\nfoundations of predicative analysis.\n\nIn his last contribution to Acta Mathematica (1909) and in\nhis fifth G\u00f6ttingen lecture (1910), he also gave a restatement of\nRichard\u2019s paradox, as a refinement of Cantor\u2019s theorem, in\nthe form: \u201cthere is no definable enumeration of definable\nreals\u201d.\n\nWhile mathematicians and Poincar\u00e9 himself focused on the\nproblems raised by the contradictions insofar as they involved the\nfoundations of specific mathematical notions (the continuum, the\nnatural numbers, the theory of cardinal and ordinal numbers), Russell\ndirectly attacked the comprehension principle, that is, the\nassumption that certain propositional functions determine a class (see\nalso\n 2.3\n above). The paradoxes prove that a propositional function may be\nwell-defined for every argument, and yet the collection of the values\nfor which it is defined need not be a class. So the crucial\nproblem becomes logical: to give a criterion for selecting those\npropositional functions which give rise to classes (understood as\nwell-defined objects).\n\nUnder the influence of Poincar\u00e9, Russell (1906, p. 634)\naccepted the vicious circle principle, for which he used a\nformulation in the terminology and adopting the notions of formal\nlogic as formulated by Peano:\n\nWhatever comprises an apparent variable should not be one among the\npossible values of that variable.\n\n\nIn logical terms, we are not allowed to quantify over a given class\n\\(X\\) when defining an element of \\(X\\) itself (see also the entry on\n definitions).\n\nOf course, the vicious circle principle is not itself a theory, but a\ncondition any adequate theory has to satisfy. Russell (1906, 1907)\ntentatively proposed three alternative approaches: the zigzag theory,\nthe theory of limitation of size, and the no-classes theory. The\nzigzag theory attempts to capture the idea that the right functions\nought to be \u2018simple\u2019, while according to the second view,\n\u2018predicative\u2019 would be characterized by a certain\nlimitation of the size of classes which can be predicatively defined\n(e.g., the collection of all ordinals \\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) is too large).\nIn the no-classes theory, classes are not independent entities and\nanything said about them is to be regarded as an abbreviation of a\nstatement about their members and the propositional functions defining\nthem. This is not far from Poincar\u00e9\u2019s idea that\nmathematical objects should be specified in finitely many words.\nHowever, Russell developed his own technical devices\u2014such as the\n\u2018substitution method\u2019 (Landini 1998), and the contextual\nelimination of definite descriptions (see the entry\n Russell)\n \u2013 in order to implement his ideas.\n\nIn contrast to Poincar\u00e9, Russell 1906 did not consider the\nactual infinite as an essential component of the foundational malaise,\nand he stressed that contradictions arise even if the infinite is not\ninvolved. This is clearly shown by the Liar paradox in the form\n\u2018I am lying\u2019. As far as we know, it is exactly at this\npoint in time that the (probably) most cited semantical puzzle in the\nhistory of logic regains a conspicuous position in logical\nanalysis.\n\nIn his analysis of the Liar paradox, Russell assumed that there exists\na true entity\u2014the proposition\u2014that is presupposed by a\ngenuine statement (e.g., when I say that Socrates is mortal, there is\na fact corresponding to my assertion and it is this fact that is\ncalled \u2018proposition\u2019). The same holds if the statement is\nfalse, but not in the case where the statement itself contains\nquantified variables.\n\nThe paradox is then solved by construing the Liar as \u2018there is a\nproposition that I state and that is false\u2019; hence the statement\ncontains a quantification (hence an apparent variable) over the\ncollection of all propositions, and it is not a proposition in a\nproper sense (Russell 1906, 642\u2013644). So the conclusion is that\nthe Liar is false because it does not state a proposition.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to the paradox suggested by\nBerry, which is briefly stated in Russell 1906 for the first time\nin published form, and has the merit of not going beyond the domain of\nfinite numbers.\n\nConsider the natural numbers that are definable by means of less than\n18 syllables: this set is non-empty and finite. So there exist numbers\nwhich are not definable using less than 18 syllables. Consider the\nleast such number: clearly, by definition, it is not definable with\nless than 18 syllables.\n\nOn the other hand such a number is definable with less than 18\nsyllables, since it is uniquely determined by the expression\n\u201cthe least number not definable with less than 18\nsyllables\u201d, which itself has less than 18 syllables.\n\nFor the sake of historical accuracy, we should remark that Beppo Levi,\nwho made an articulated contribution to the debate on the axiom of\nchoice in the first two decades of the 1900s, outlined an antinomy\nwhich is essentially a variant of Berry\u2019s paradox in the context\nof discussing Richard\u2019s paradox (see Levi 1908, and also Lolli\n2007 and Bruni 2013 for further comments about Levi\u2019s approach\nto paradoxes).\n",
