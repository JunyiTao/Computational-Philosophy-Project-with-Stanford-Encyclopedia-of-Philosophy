Analyses of Hope in the Psychological Literature\n\nPsychologists and psychoanalysts have systematically investigated hope\nsince the 1950s (Frank 1968, for an overview, see Gallagher et al.\n2020). In many of these first studies, hope was seen as a cognitive\nprocess of directing agency that rests on the perception of an outcome\nas important for an agent to achieve and as having a certain\nprobability (Stotland 1969). While this understanding of hope deviates\nfrom the standard philosophical account (see section 3) by requiring a\nminimal probability, it continues to play a major role in the current\npsychological literature.\n\nCurrently, the most influential psychological approach to hope is\nCharles Snyder\u2019s hope theory (for an overview, see Rand and\nCheavens 2009). Snyder defines hope as follows:\n\n\nWithin a goal-setting framework, we propose that there are two major,\ninterrelated elements of hope. First, we hypothesize that hope is\nfueled by the perception of successful agency related to goals. The\nagency component refers to a sense of successful determination in\nmeeting goals in the past, present, and future. Second, we hypothesize\nthat hope is influenced by the perceived availability of successful\npathways related to goals. (Snyder et al. 1991: 570)\n\n\nOn this basis, Snyder and others have developed various measures of\nhope, such as the Adult Hope Scale (ibid.), and the State Hope\nScale (Snyder et al. 1996) that have received strong\nexperimental support and are widely used globally (see Gallagher et\nal. 2020: 193\u2013196 and Rose and Sieben 2018 for discussion of other\nmeasures).\n\nSeveral objections have been raised against Snyder\u2019s analysis of\nhope. One is that the \u201cperception of agency\u201d relates both\nto the past and the future and therefore measures a general trait of\nhopefulness rather than the hope for specific outcomes. As a response,\npsychologists have developed further \u201cdomain-specific\u201d\nhope scales (Lopez et al. 2000: 61). A second question concerns the\nissue of whether Snyder\u2019s definition of hope is sufficiently\ndistinct from optimism (see Miceli and Castelfranchi 2010; Aspinwall\nand Leaf 2002). Snyder wants to distinguish hope from optimism by\nlinking hope to beliefs about self-efficacy (Snyder 2002; Snyder, Rand\nand Sigmon 2018; Magaletta and Oliver 1999) and reserving the term\n\u201coptimism\u201d for generalized expectations about positive\noutcomes. However, the ordinary use of the term is better captured by\nthe idea that hope can be upheld even if one does not assign a high\nprobability to the outcome.\n",
