    "main_text": "Some important conceptions\n7. Some important conceptions\n\nThe terms \u015bakyat\u0101vacchedaka and\nprav\u1e5bttinimitta signify a property which determines the\ninclusion of a particular instance within the class of possible\nentities referred to by a word. It is a property whose possession by\nan entity is the necessary and sufficient condition for a given word\nbeing used to refer to that entity. Thus, the property of potness may\nbe viewed as the \u015bakyat\u0101vacchedaka controlling the\nuse of the word \u201cpot\u201d.\n\nThe concept of lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 (\u201csecondary\nsignification function\u201d) is invoked in a situation where the\nprimary meaning of an utterance does not appear to make sense in view\nof the intention behind the utterance, and hence one looks for a\nsecondary meaning. However, the secondary meaning is always something\nthat is related to the primary meaning in some way. For example, the\nexpression ga\u1e45g\u0101y\u0101\u1e43\ngho\u1e63a\u1e25 literally refers to a cowherd-colony on\nthe Ganges. Here, it is argued that one obviously cannot have a\ncowherd-colony sitting on top of the river Ganges. This would clearly\ngo against the intention of the speaker. Thus, there is both a\ndifficulty of justifying the linkage of word-meanings\n(anvay\u0101nupapatti) and a difficulty of justifying the\nliteral or primary meaning in relation to the intention of the speaker\n(t\u0101tpary\u0101nupapatti). These interpretive\ndifficulties nudge one away from the primary meaning of the expression\nto a secondary meaning, which is related to that primary meaning.\nThus, we understand the expression as referring to a cowherd-colony\n\u201con the bank of the river Ganges\u201d.\n\nIt is the next level of meaning or vya\u00f1jan\u0101\n(\u201csuggestive signification function\u201d) which is analyzed\nand elaborated more specifically by authors like \u0100nandavardhana\nin the tradition of Sanskrit poetics. Consider the following instance\nof poetic suggestion. With her husband out on a long travel, a\nlovelorn young wife instructs a visiting young man: \u201cMy dear\nguest, I sleep here and my night-blind mother-in-law sleeps over\nthere. Please make sure you do not stumble at night.\u201d The\nsuggested meaning is an invitation to the young man to come and share\nher bed. Thus, the poetic language goes well beyond the levels of\nlexical and metaphorical meanings, and heightens the aesthetic\npleasure through such suggestions.\n",
