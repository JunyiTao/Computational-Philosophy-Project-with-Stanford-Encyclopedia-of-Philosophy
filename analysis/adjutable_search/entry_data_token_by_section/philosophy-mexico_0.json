    "main_text": "Some Metaphilosophical Questions\n1. Some Metaphilosophical Questions\n\nThroughout Latin America, philosophers have raised metaphilosophical\nquestions about the originality and peculiarity of their own\nphilosophy. Likewise, it is often claimed that philosophy in\nMexico is not the same as Mexican philosophy, and that\nwhile philosophy in Mexico has a long and distinguished history, it is\nwrong to speak of Mexican philosophy, defined by the originality or\nauthenticity of its debates or theses, the distinctness of its\nschools, or the uniqueness of its style or terminology (see Romanell\n1975). Other scholars disagree and argue that there are indeed\nsubstantive, thematic, or stylistic continuities that underlie much of\nthe philosophy produced in Mexico and that allow us to speak of\nMexican philosophy as an original and authentic tradition. Still\nothers believe that although philosophy in Mexico does not constitute\na unified and distinct tradition yet, it has the potential to\nbecome one. (For an extended discussion of the difference between\n\u201cMexican philosophy\u201d and \u201cPhilosophy in\nMexico\u201d, see Hurtado 2007, particularly chapter 2.)\n\nTo complicate the metaphilosophical discussion further, while\nphilosophy has been produced in Mexico for over 500 years, it is\nmisleading to speak of \u201cMexican philosophy\u201d before Mexico\nwon its independence from Spain in 1821. That is, with few exceptions\ndid Mexican thinkers and philosophers living under colonial rule or\nbefore think of themselves or their work as Mexican. Even\ntoday, given that the development of Mexican philosophy is emerging\nlargely as a collaborative effort among Mexican and Latinx\nphilosophers, it is perhaps more accurate to speak of\ntrans-Mexican philosophy\u2014again, as a tradition not\nneatly defined by political borders. What we call trans-Mexican\nphilosophy should not be confused with Mexican-American or\nChicanx philosophy, although they are closely related (see\nthe related entry on\n Latinx philosophy).\n Instead, it refers to a field of inquiry that focuses on the\nextension and application of Mexican philosophy outside of Mexico,\nparticularly in the United States, and on the way in which the current\ndevelopments in Mexican philosophy both in Mexico and the United\nStates are mutually supportive.\n\nEven allowing for a certain flexibility in how we define Mexican\nphilosophy, not all philosophers in Mexico think that cultivating\nMexican philosophy as a distinct tradition is a worthy goal. Many\nbelieve that we ought to leave the pursuit of national philosophies in\nthe past. So, like Roger Bartra, who coined the phrase the\npost-Mexican condition (see Bartra 2002), we might speak of a\npost-Mexican philosophy, that is, of a philosophy that is\nproduced in Mexico but which does not aim to represent Mexican culture\nat all.\n\nWe will not discuss these metaphilosophical issues further (see the\nrelated entry on\n Latin American philosophy: metaphilosophical foundations).\n Our primary concern is to provide a sketch of the history of\nphilosophy in Mexico.\n",
