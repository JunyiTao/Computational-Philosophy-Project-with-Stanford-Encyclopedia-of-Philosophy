    "main_text": "\n\nIn the 21st century, new media technologies for social\nnetworking such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and YouTube began to\ntransform the social, political and informational practices of\nindividuals and institutions across the globe, inviting philosophical\nresponses from the community of applied ethicists and philosophers of\ntechnology. While scholarly responses to social media continue to be\nchallenged by the rapidly evolving nature of these technologies, the\nurgent need for attention to the social networking phenomenon is\nunderscored by the fact that it has profoundly reshaped how many human\nbeings initiate and/or maintain virtually every type of ethically\nsignificant social bond or role: friend-to-friend, parent-to-child,\nco-worker-to co-worker, employer-to-employee, teacher-to-student,\nneighbor-to-neighbor, seller-to-buyer, doctor-to-patient, and\nvoter-to-voter, to offer just a partial list. Nor are the ethical\nimplications of these technologies strictly interpersonal, as it has\nbecome evident that social networking services (hereafter referred to\nas SNS) and other new digital media have profound implications for\ndemocracy, public institutions and the rule of law. The complex web of\ninteractions between SNS developers and users, and their online and\noffline communities, corporations and governments\u2014along with the\ndiverse and sometimes conflicting motives and interests of these\nvarious stakeholders\u2014will continue to require rigorous ethical\nanalysis for decades to come.\n\nSection 1 of the entry outlines the history and working definition of\nsocial networking services. Section 2 identifies the early\nphilosophical foundations of reflection on the ethics of online social\nnetworks, leading up to the emergence of Web 2.0 standards (supporting\nuser interactions) and full-fledged SNS. Section 3 reviews the primary\nethical topic areas around which philosophical reflections on SNS\nhave, to date, converged: privacy; identity and community; friendship,\nvirtue and the good life; democracy, free speech,\nmisinformation/disinformation and the public sphere; and cybercrime.\nFinally, Section 4 reviews some of the metaethical issues potentially\nimpacted by the emergence of SNS.\n",
