    "main_text": "\n\nDebates about scientific realism are closely connected to almost\neverything else in the philosophy of science, for they concern the\nvery nature of scientific knowledge. Scientific realism is a positive\nepistemic attitude toward the content of our best theories and models,\nrecommending belief in both observable and unobservable aspects of the\nworld described by the sciences. This epistemic attitude has important\nmetaphysical and semantic dimensions, and these various commitments\nare contested by a number of rival epistemologies of science, known\ncollectively as forms of scientific antirealism. This article explains\nwhat scientific realism is, outlines its main variants, considers the\nmost common arguments for and against the position, and contrasts it\nwith its most important antirealist counterparts.\n",
