    "main_text": "Political Thought\n6. Pietas and Philosophia Christi\n\nThe term philosophia Christi , the philosophy of Christ,\nfirst appears in patristic writings. It is an aspect of the larger\nconcept of pietas, the moral conscience governing the proper\nrelationship between individual and God as well as the individual and\nsociety. A central tenet in Erasmus\u2019 spiritual writings,\npietas thus straddles the subjects of theology and\nphilosophy.\n\nThe main sources for Erasmus\u2019 concepts of piety and the\nphilosophy centered on Christ are his Enchiridion Militis\nChristiani (Handbook of the Christian Soldier, 1503) with its\nprefatory letter to the 1518 edition (Ep. 858; CWE 6), the\nParaclesis (Summons, 1516) and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, his lampoon of human foibles, Moriae Encomium\n(The Praise of Folly, 1511). As he said in reply to indignant critics\nof his famous jeu d\u2019esprit:\n\n\nThe Folly is concerned in a playful spirit with the same\nsubject as the Handbook of the Christian Soldier. My purpose\nwas guidance and not satire; to help, not to hurt; to show men how to\nbecome better, and not stand in their way\u2026not only to cure them\nbut to amuse them, too. I had often observed that this cheerful and\nhumorous style of putting people right is with many of them most\nsuccessful. (Ep. 337: 98\u2013101, 126\u20138; CWE 3)\n\n\nWhile the Paraclesis, the Enchiridion, and the\nMoriae Encomium constitute the main sources for\nErasmus\u2019 thoughts on Christian morality, this theme is so\npervasive in his works, that any attempt to define his concept of\npietas \u201cwould be almost tantamount to summarizing and\nsynthesizing everything that has been written on Erasmus\u201d\n(O\u2019Malley in CWE 66: xv). Three characteristics stand out,\nhowever. Piety is an internal quality independent of the outward\nobservance of rites; it is perfected through divine grace; and it is\ninclusive, that is, open to all.\n\nErasmus calls pietas a quality of the mind (animi\naffectus, LB X: 1675 B) which is expressed in a person\u2019s\nway of life. Describing human nature, he notes the dichotomy of spirit\nand flesh which parallels the duality of visible and invisible things.\nPiety requires the development of a person\u2019s inner, spiritual\nqualities:\n\n\n[A person] participates in the visible world through the body, and in\nthe invisible through the soul. Since we are but pilgrims in the\nvisible world, we should never make it our fixed abode, but should\nrelate by a fitting comparison everything that occurs to the senses\neither to the angelic world or, in more practical terms, to morals and\nto that part of man that corresponds to the angelic. (CWE 66: 65)\n\n\nErasmus\u2019 emphasis on piety as an inner quality is a response to\nthe undue importance his contemporaries placed on external ceremonies.\nHe offered his definition as an alternative or rather, a corrective to\nthe ritualistic observances which he calls \u201ca kind of\nJudaism\u201d (CWE 66: 74). He used the term \u201cJudaism\u201d\nbecause in his eyes the rigid observance of rites exemplified the\nspirit of the Old Testament, which had been superseded by the new\ncovenant with Christ. His critique of ritualistic practices puts him\nin the vanguard of the Reformation, whose representatives also\nprotested against the emptiness of ceremonies in the absence of\nsincere faith. Like Luther, Erasmus demanded \u201cChristian\nliberty\u201d, that is, deliverance from the dead letter of the\nlaw.\n\nFor Erasmus, monasticism typified the superstitious observance of\nexternal rites and the reliance on human works instead of divine\ngrace. In a notorious phrase, he declared: Monachatus non est\npietas, being a member of a religious order does not amount to\npiety. \u201cI advise you to identify piety not with diet, or dress,\nor any visible thing, but with what I have taught here [in the\nEnchiridion]\u201d\u2014the priority of soul over body and\nof the inner over the outer person (CWE 66: 127).\n\nThe question of Erasmus\u2019 affiliation with ancient schools of\nphilosophy comes up often in Erasmus scholarship. Some scholars have\nassociated Erasmus\u2019 dualism with Platonic philosophy, although\nit is more readily explained as a Christian principle and more\nspecifically as Pauline teaching, which Erasmus discusses at length in\nthe Enchiridion. He does quote Plato as well, but then it is\nhis habit to cite classical sources in order to give a historical and\npan-cultural dimension to Christian values. Indeed he drew on a number\nof models, both pagan and Christian, to describe human nature. Thus he\nalso introduced the concept of a three-fold division\u2014body, soul,\nand spirit\u2014an idea for which he cited Origen. Scholars have also\npointed to the Stoic underpinnings found in Erasmus\u2019 thoughts on\npietas and even argued that he consciously embraced the Stoic\nconcept of the simultaneous working of two opposite but equally\nessential types of value: spirit and instinct (Dealy 2017). Many years\nago, R. Bultot studied the Epicurean tendencies of the early work,\nOn disdaining the World, in which Erasmus speaks of the\nspiritual pleasures of the solitary life, calling its rationale\n\u201cEpicurean\u201d (Bultot in Coppens 1969, 2: 205\u2013238).\nMore recently, John Monfasani has emphasized the role of Christian\nEpicureanism in Erasmus\u2019 work (Monfasani 2012). Most famously,\nRichard Popkin highlights the role of Erasmus in the revival of\nSkepticism in early modern Europe (Popkin 1964). For her part, Maria\nCytowska classifies Erasmus as an eclectic philosopher, indeed a\n\u201cChristian eclectic\u201d, who chooses among ancient philosophy\nwhatever is closest to Christian religion (Cytowska 1976). In the\nEnchiridion, Erasmus does not privilege one philosophy over\nanother but deliberately presents various concepts of human nature by\nway of offering a survey of philosophical positions. He\n\u201cprovided a mass of material\u201d (CWE 66: 54), illustrating\nin a general way the superiority of spiritual over material concerns.\nHis message to the reader was: You should be able to master as a\nChristian and for the love of God \u201cwhat pagan philosophers did\nnot find hard\u2026for the sake of learning or reputation\u201d\n(CWE 66: 142).\n\nErasmus described his Enchiridion as a \u201csummary\nguide\u201d to Christian living, which included not only personal,\nbut also public piety. In its social dimension, pietas equals\ncaritas, love of one\u2019s neighbor. Caritas in\nturn parallels love of God. Caring for one\u2019s neighbor is\n\u201chow our heavenly creditor taught us to pay our debt\u201d (CWE\n66: 124).\n\nThe ability to fulfill one\u2019s moral duty depends on divine grace,\nhowever, and is an aspect of pietas related to the Catholic\ndoctrine of Free Will. Thus human beings have a capacity for piety and\na moral duty as well as the power to do good, although their power is\nlimited and dependent on the efficacy of divine grace. Erasmus is\nemphatic about this aspect in his definition of the philosophia\nChristi, that is, the pursuit of pietas. In a letter to\nJan Slechta (1519), he writes:\n\n\nThe whole of Christian philosophy lies in this, our understanding that\nall our hope is placed in God, who freely gives us all things through\nJesus his son, that we were redeemed by his death and engrafted\nthrough baptism with his body, that we might be dead to the desires of\nthis world and live by his teaching and example\u2026that we may\never advance from one virtue to another, yet in such a way that we\nclaim nothing for ourselves, but ascribe any good we do to God. (Ep.\n1039: 245\u201354; CWE 7)\n\n\nThe Erasmian concept of piety was \u201cprincipled rather than\nprescriptive\u201d (as O\u2019Malley puts it, CWE 66: xix). It is\nironic (and perhaps meant ironically) that Erasmus chose to present\nhis counsel in the form of twenty-two rules since his overall message\nis that there are no fixed rules and no need for definitions and\npronouncements. These are the hallmark of institutional theology,\nwhereas the philosophy of Christ does not require formal training or\nattendance at university. It is open to anyone: \u201cno one is\nprevented from being godly; and, I shall boldly add, no one is\nprevented from being a theologian\u201d (CWE 41: 415). Every\nChristian must study the bible, however, Erasmus says.\n\n\nI would like every woman to read the Gospel, to read the Epistles of\nPaul. And oh, that these books were translated into every tongue of\nevery land so that not only the Scots and the Irish, but Turks and\nSaracens too could read and get to know them\u2026How I wish that\nthe farmer at his plow would chant some passage from these books, that\nthe weaver at his shuttles would sing something from them; that the\ntraveler would relieve the tedium of his journey with stories of this\nkind. (CWE 41: 411)\n\n\nPietas does not depend on learning. Faith is the only\nprerequisite. This is the conclusion Erasmus offers in The Praise\nof Folly. He begins his satire showing off his classical learning\nand ends it paradoxically by praising the devout fool. Those who scorn\nthe world are considered fools or madmen by the majority of people,\nErasmus says, but they will inherit God\u2019s kingdom and in their\necstasy \u201cfeel some foretaste and savour of the reward to\ncome\u201d (CWE 27: 152).\n\nPraising Christian folly in such extravagant terms, Erasmus seems to\nalign himself with the radical mystics who considered human\nintelligence worthless and studies futile. As we have seen, however,\neducation is a central concern for Erasmus, and what seems like a\ncontradiction, is merely a matter of priorities. Erasmus urges\neveryone to pursue learning, as long as it plays a supportive role to\nfaith. He repeatedly praises docta pietas, piety which\ncombines learning with a devout and humble spirit and warns against\nits opposite, impia curiositas, unholy inquisitiveness.\nDocta pietas means respecting the limits of human\nunderstanding.\n\n\nWhat is granted to you to see, fall down before it and kiss it; what\nis not granted to see--this, though concealed, worship nevertheless\nfrom afar in sincere faith, and venerate whatever it is. Let ungodly\ncuriosity be absent [absit impia curiositas],\n\n\nhe counsels students of theology in the Ratio (Vessey 2021,\n117). For Erasmus, St. Jerome is the embodiment of docta\npietas. In his Life of Jerome (which prefaces his\nedition of the works of the Church Father, 1516), he depicted him as\nthe Christian scholar par excellence, combining Ciceronian\neloquence with a thorough understanding of theology and a devout\nspirit with a holy life.\n\nIn the Paraclesis Erasmus distinguished the simple philosophy\nof Christ from that of Plato, Aristotle, and other philosophical\nwriters of antiquity, pointing out that the gospel provided the only\ncertain doctrine and Christ was the only true teacher (CWE 41: 408).\nFor Erasmus learning and knowledge were qualities that had no value\nunless they centered on Christ and contributed to an understanding of\nthe philosophia Christi. Even language studies, which formed\nthe core of his curriculum proposal, had to be subordinated to that\ngoal. He wished for an eloquence\n\n\nwhich does not simply charm the ears by a pleasure soon to die, but\nwhich leaves barbs clinging in the hearts of those who hear; an\neloquence that seizes, transforms, and sends the listener away a much\ndifferent person from the one it received. (CWE 41: 406)\n\n\nThis is the goal of a preacher\u2019s eloquence, as Erasmus explains\nin the Ecclesiastes (The Evangelical Preacher, 1535). There\nhe adapts the threefold task Cicero envisages for the speaker\u2014to\ninstruct, to move, to entertain\u2014and develops the idea that the\ninspired words of a preacher will not only move but transform the\nlisteners, that the preacher\u2019s sermon will captivate not only\nthe mind but also the soul of the hearers. This ability is \u201ca\ngift of the Holy Spirit\u201d however (CWE 67: 283).\n\nAlthough Erasmus\u2019 curriculum focused on the authors of classical\nantiquity, the philosophy of Christ required the adaption of pagan\nideas to Christian thought and their application to Christian ideals,\na process Erasmus called (after Augustine) \u201cspoiling the\nEgyptians\u201d. Accordingly he urges the preacher in the\nEcclesiastes to select suitable material from classical\nwriters but inject a Christian perspective. Erasmus himself edited and\ntranslated a number of pagan writers whose teachings he considered\ngermane to the philosophy of Christ. Among them, he singled out\nPlutarch: \u201cI have read nothing outside of Scripture with such a\nhigh moral tone\u201d (Ep. 1341A: 259\u201360; CWE 9). He had high\npraise also for the Platonists, \u201cbecause in much of their\nthinking as well as in their mode of expression they are the closest\nto the spirit of the prophets and the gospel\u201d ( CWE 66: 33).\n\nErasmus was a prolific writer. His works were translated into the\nvernacular and circulated widely. His ideas had a strong impact that\ncan be traced into the modern age. Even in his own time, the term\n\u201cErasmian\u201d denoted a certain set of values. In 1530, the\nLeuven theologian Frans Titelmans noted that enthusiasts of humanistic\nstudies were called \u201cErasmians\u201d because Erasmus was their\nchief inspiration (1530, Ei verso\u2013Eii recto). His contemporary,\nthe Swiss chronicler Johann Kessler, declared that \u201cwhatever is\nskilled, polished, learned, and wise is called Erasmian\u201d\n(1523\u20131539, 87). It was classical learning and eloquence that\ndefined Erasmus in his own time, and modern scholarship has come to\nrecognize the role that Erasmus played in the cultivation of his own\nimage (see Jardine 1993). In the Age of Enlightenment he was\ncelebrated as a rationalist, an image that held into the\n20th century (as chronicled by Mansfield 1992). Wilhelm\nDilthey, for example, called Erasmus the Voltaire of the\n16th century (GS II, 74). The emphasis shifted in the\n20th century, when Erasmus\u2019 irenicism caught\nreaders\u2019 attention. Thus Jos\u00e9 Chapiro (1950) dedicated\nhis translation of The Complaint of Peace to the United\nNations, and Erasmus\u2019 biographer Johan Huizinga identified\n\u201cErasmian\u201d with \u201cgentleness, kindliness, and\nmoderation\u201d (1912 [1957], 194). In 1999, Ralf Dahrendorf defined\nErasmus-Menschen as people guided by reason and avoiding the\npitfalls of political extremism. Their hallmark was compassion and\ntolerance. In contemporary usage, then, \u201cErasmian\u201d has\ncome to denote a liberal thinker, an attitude or modus\nvivendi rather than a school of philosophy. The newest trend\nemerging from contemporary scholarship is to recognize Erasmus as one\nof the makers of the modern book, due to his collaboration with\nprinters and book sellers and his indefatigable efforts as editor of\nclassical and patristic texts (see Vanautgaerden 2012).\n",
