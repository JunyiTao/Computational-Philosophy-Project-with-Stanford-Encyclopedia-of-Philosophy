Ceteris Paribus Laws: Metaphysics, Language, and Science \n\nIn the current literature, a number of novel trends and innovative\napproaches to cp-laws have emerged that cannot easily be subsumed\nunder the already existing accounts. For this reason they deserve\nspecial mention. We believe there are at least four clearly\ndiscernable novel tendencies in the current work on cp-laws:\n\n\n\nA reconnection to metaphysics: One of the most salient trends\nin the current literature is that the discussion of cp-laws\n(re)connects philosophy of science to analytic metaphysics in at least\nthree respects: (i) current accounts of cp-laws make use of David\nLewis\u2019s (1973) best system account of laws; moreover, (ii) the\ninterpretation of objective probabilities and (iii) the metaphysics of\ndispositions are brought into play for making progress in\nunderstanding cp-law statements. \n\nThe most vivid sign of this reconnection consists in the fact that\nseveral authors have recently defended a friendly amendment of David\nLewis\u2019s best system account of laws of nature. While\nLewis\u2019s (1973, 73) original version primarily focuses on\nfundamental laws, the amended versions are intended to capture also\nnon-fundamental laws of the special sciences. Schrenk (2007a, 2014),\nCallender and Cohen (2009, 2010), and Frisch (2014a) defend a\nso-called \u201cbetter best system\u201d account of special science\nlaws. Unterhuber (2014) develops a version of the \u201cbetter best\nsystem\u201d account utilizing generics. Jaag and Loew (forthcoming)\nargue for a pragmatic version of the best systems account that\ncaptures also central insights of the \u201cbetter best system\u201d\ntheory. On their view, the universality of laws is not an end in\nitself. If a generalization\u2019s invariance is, e.g., limited to\nour cosmic epoch only, this limited invariance arguably would be\nenough to make it useful for us and thus a law according to this\naccount. Reutlinger (2009) and Backmann and Reutlinger (2014) provide\na critical discussion of \u201cbetter best system\u201d accounts.\nBraddon-Mitchell (2001) and Wheeler (2018) present versions of a best\nsystems account deploying the idea of algorithmic compression from\ndata science. Albert (2000, 2015) and Loewer (2009) advocate a\n\u201cstatistical mechanical\u201d version of the best systems\napproach to special science laws which is, unlike the \u201cbetter\nbest system\u201d account, committed to a particular\nBoltzmann-inspired interpretation of statistical mechanics (including\nassumptions about the early history of the universe). Weslake (2014)\nand Frisch (2014b) provide critical responses, while Fenton-Glynn\n(2016) constructively uses examples by Albert and Loewer for an\nanalysis of cp-laws. Finally, Albert and Loewer\u2019s account also\nconnects the debate on cp-laws with the on-going discussion on whether\ncausation has a place in fundamental physics or whether causation is\nan \u2018emergent\u2019 phenomenon captured by the cp-law statements\nof the special sciences (Price and Corry 2007 and Frisch 2014b are\nrepresentative of the opposing views in the debate on causation in\nphysics).\n\nAlso other metaphysical issues besides Lewis\u2019s account of\nlawhood influence the recent literature on cp-laws. The metaphysics of\nprobabilities and disposition stand out in this respect. Taking up\nresults from Earman and Roberts (1999) and Schurz (2002), several\nauthors including H\u00fcttemann and Reutlinger (2013), Kowalenko\n(2014), Roberts (2014), Reutlinger (2014), and Strevens (2014) discuss\nthe prospects of a statistical approach to cp-laws (or a\n\u201csoftness\u201d approach, to use Strevens\u2019s term),\naccording to which cp-laws are statistical claims. (Notice that the\nnormality account presented in section 8 above is but a special case\nof the broader statistical approach to cp-laws).\n\nA third metaphysical trend concerns the metaphysics of dispositions:\nAs we have explained in section 7 above, H\u00fcttemann (2014) and\nPemberton and Cartwright (2014) argue in favor of a dispositionalist\naccount of cp-laws and provide responses to standard objections to the\ndispositionalist view (for instance, to objections voiced by Earman\nand Roberts 1999). \n\n\nDrawing on linguistics and philosophy of language: Several\nrecent approaches to cp-laws explicitly draw on research in\nlinguistics and philosophy of language. Taking into account linguistic\nwork on generics, Nickel (2010, 2014) argues that our understanding of\ncp-law statements is improved if one takes them to be generics and\nuses the formal semantics for generics to shed light on the meaning of\ncp-law statements (for approaches to cp-laws deploying generics, see\nalso Unterhuber and Schurz 2013; Unterhuber 2014; and Claveau und\nGirard 2019). Roberts (2014) makes contact with philosophy of language\nin analyzing cp-laws as vague and indexical statements about\nfrequencies. Ward (2007), Karbasizadeh (2008) and Nickel (2014)\nexplore the link between cp-laws and different accounts of natural\nkind terms. \n\n\nSensitivity to the sciences: Several philosophers have made\nan effort to draw attention to the fact that an adequate discussion of\nlaws has to be sensitive to the differences between distinct\nscientific disciplines. Their motivation is to provide a theory of\nlaws that fits generalizations (and models) in the life sciences, the\nsocial sciences and, more generally, the sciences of complex systems\n(for instance, see Mitchell 1997, 2002a,b; 2008, 2009; Sober 1997;\nSteel 2007; and Reiss 2008). In particular, Mitchell (2000), Strevens\n(2003, 2008), Craver (2007), H\u00fcttemann (2007), Wimsatt (2007),\nTobin (2005), Woodward (2010) and Reutlinger (2011, 2013) distinguish\nvarious dimensions of characterizing how generalizations in these\nscientific disciplines may be non-universal or allow for exceptions.\nThese dimensions include stability, robustness, specificity, and\nhistorical contingency (see Reutlinger and Unterhuber 2014b for an\noverview). In a similar vein, Schurz (2014) introduces a novel\ndistinction between ceteris paribus and ceteris\nrectis laws. Fenton-Glynn (2016) holds that some higher-level\nlaws about the macro-behavior of complex systems (his central example\nis the second law of thermodynamics) are \u201cminutis\nrectis\u201d laws and should be distinguished from cp-laws,\nbecause their non-universal character stems from a probability\ndistribution over initial micro-conditions (see Strevens 2003 for\nfurther examples). Finally, motivated by examples from population\necology, earth science, and statistical mechanics, Strevens (2008) and\nWeisberg (2013) argue for a new interpretation of laws and models\ninvolving idealized assumptions, the minimalist account of\nidealizations. Strevens (2012, 2014) proposes treating cp-laws and\nidealized laws separately. What seems to emerge from this literature\nis that the ceteris paribus character of generalizations is\nmulti-faceted. There is a number of ways in which a generalization can\nbe non-universal: due to idealizations, by expressing statistical\nregularities and probability distributions over initial conditions, by\ndrawing on the notion of normality, by being sensitive to changes in\ninitial and background conditions, and so on (see Reutlinger and\nUnterhuber 2014b for a more detailed analysis). \n\n\nUsing scientific concepts and methods: recent philosophical\nattempts of capturing cp-laws increasingly involve importing key\nconcepts from the sciences and using these concepts for developing a\ngeneral theory of cp-laws. Inspired by classical mechanics, Maudlin\n(2007) and H\u00fcttemann (2014) analyze cp-conditions in terms of\ndefault or inertial behavior. Both authors capture a violation of\ncp-conditions as a deviation from inertial behavior, where deviating\nfrom inertial behavior is itself a process governed by laws of\ndeviation (Maudlin) or laws of interaction and composition\n(H\u00fcttemann). Other philosophers are influenced by the life\nsciences such as Nickel (2014), Pemberton and Cartwright (2014), and\nStrevens (2012, 2014) who rely on the concept of a mechanism in order\nto explicate the content of cp-conditions more generally. Kowalenko\n(2014) argues that cp-laws are best understood by drawing on methods\nfrom statistics, such as multivariate regression analysis (for a\ndiscussion of similar statistical approaches see H\u00fcttemann and\nReutlinger 2013, Reutlinger 2014, Roberts 2014, and Strevens 2014).\nSchurz (2014) uses causal Bayesian networks as a formal framework for\na causal reconstruction of ceteris paribus and ceteris\nrectis laws. Finally, Jhun (2018) argues that focusing on the\nequilibrium methodology used in thermodynamics as well as in economic\nreasoning facilitates a new understanding of the explanatory role of\ncp-laws in terms of efficient performance.  \n\n",
