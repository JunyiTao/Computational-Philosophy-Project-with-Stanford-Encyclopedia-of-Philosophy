    "main_text": "Art and Technology\n6. Art and Technology\nThat Benjamin approached the symptomatic significance of the\n\u2018crisis of the arts\u2019 for the \u2018crisis of\nexperience\u2019 through the concept of Technik attests to\nthe fundamentally Marxist character of his conception of historical\ndevelopment. It is the development of the forces of production that is\nthe motor of history. However, Benjamin was no more orthodox a Marxist\nabout technology than he was with regard to the concept of progress,\nthe Marxist version of which the German Social Democratic Party (SPD)\ngrounded upon it (see Section 8, below). Not only did he recognize the\npotential for a \u201cbloodbath\u201d in a technology subjected to\n\u201cthe lust for profit\u201d (SW\u00a0 1, 487)\u2014amply\ndemonstrated in the horrors of the First World War\u2014but he came\nto distinguish between a \u2018first\u2019 and a\n\u2018second\u2019, potentially liberatory technology, the latter\nmaking possible \u201ca highly productive use of the human being\u2019s\nself-alienation\u201d (SW 3, 107; 113). It appears, in places, as the\nbasis for a kind of \u2018technological cosmopolitics\u2019 or\npolitics of a \u2018new collective technoid body\u2019 (Caygill\n2005, 225; Leslie 2000, 153, in Osborne 2005, II: 391).\n\n\nThe mastery of nature, so the imperialists teach, is the purpose of\nall technology [Technik]. But \u2026technology is not the\nmastery of nature but of the relation between nature and\nhumanity. \u2026In technology a physis is being organized\nthrough which mankind\u2019s contact with the cosmos takes a new and\ndifferent form from that which it had in nations\n[V\u00f6lkern] and families. (SW 1, 487, translation\namended)\nThe collective is a body, too. And the physis that is\nbeing organized for it in technology can, through all its political\nand factual reality, only be produced in that image sphere to which\nprofane illumination initiates us. Only when in technology body and\nimage so interpenetrate that all revolutionary tension becomes bodily\ncollective innervation, and all the bodily innervations of the\ncollective become revolutionary discharge, has reality transcended\nitself to the extent demanded by the Communist Manifesto. (SW\n2, 217\u20138)\n\nThese passages, from the concluding sections of One-Way Street\nand the \u2018Surrealism\u2019 essay, respectively, convey something\nof the ecstatic character of Benjamin\u2019s political thought at the\noutset of the 1930s, in which technology appears on a political\nknife-edge between its possibilities as \u201ca fetish of doom\u201d\nand \u201ca key to happiness\u201d (SW 2, 321). Art\u2014an art of\nthe masses\u2014appears within this scenario as the educative\nmechanism through which the body of the collective can begin to\nappropriate its own technological potential.\n\nThe first technology really sought to master nature, whereas the\nsecond aims rather at an interplay between nature and humanity. The\nprimary social function of art today is to rehearse that\ninterplay. This applies especially to film. The function of film\nis to train human beings in the apperception and reactions needed to\ndeal with a vast apparatus whose role in their lives is expanding\nalmost daily. Dealing with this apparatus also teaches them that\ntechnology will release them from their enslavement to the powers of\nthe apparatus only when humanity\u2019s whole constitution has adapted\nitself to the new productive forces which the second technology has\nset free. (SW 3, 107\u20138)\nIn his footnote to this passage from the second version of\n\u2018The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical\nReproducibility\u2019 (\u2018Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner\ntechnischen Reproduzierbarkeit\u2019, 1936), Benjamin refers us\nto the \u2018phalansteries\u2019, the \u201cself-contained agrarian\ncollectives\u201d of Fourier\u2019s socialist utopia. In the Fourier\nconvolute of the Arcades Project, these are compared to the\ntwo main articles of Benjamin\u2019s politics: \u201cthe idea of\nrevolution as an innervation of the technical organs of the\ncollective\u2026 and the idea of the \u2018cracking open of natural\nteleology\u2019\u201d (AP, [W7, 4], 631). For Benjamin, art, in the\nform of film\u2014the \u201cunfolding <result> of all the\nforms of perception, the tempos and rhythms, which lie preformed in\ntoday\u2019s machines\u201d\u2014thus harboured the possibility of\nbecoming a kind of rehearsal of the revolution. \u201c[A]ll problems\nof contemporary art\u201d, Benjamin insisted, \u201cfind their\ndefinitive formulation only in the context of film\u201d (AP, [K3,\n3], 394). In this respect, it was the combination of the communist\npedagogy and constructive devices of Brecht\u2019s epic theatre that marked\nit out for him as a theatre for the age of film (UB, 1\u201325;\nWizisla 2009).\nBenjamin\u2019s writings on film are justly renowned for their twin\ntheses of the transformation of the concept of art by its\n\u2018technical reproducibility\u2019 and the new possibilities for\ncollective experience this contains, in the wake of the historical\ndecline of the \u2018aura\u2019 of the work of art, a process that\nfilm is presented as definitively concluding. Much ink has been spilt\ndebating the thesis of the decline of the aura in Benjamin\u2019s\nwork. On the one hand, with regard to some of his writings,\nBenjamin\u2019s concept of aura has been accused of fostering a\nnostalgic, purely negative sense of modernity as loss\u2014loss of\nunity both with nature and in community (A. Benjamin 1989). On the\nother hand, in the work on film, Benjamin appears to adopt an\naffirmative technological modernism, which celebrates the consequences\nof the decline. Adorno, for one, felt betrayed by the latter position.\nHe wrote to Benjamin on 18 March 1936:\n\nIn your earlier writings\u2026 you distinguished the\nidea of the work of art as a structure from the symbol of theology on\nthe one hand, and from the taboo of magic on the other. I now find it\nsomewhat disturbing\u00a0\u2014and here I can see a sublimated\nremnant of certain Brechtian themes\u2014that you have now rather\ncasually transferred the concept of the magical aura to the\n\u2018autonomous work of work\u2019 and flatly assigned a\ncounter-revolutionary function to the latter. (BA, 128)\nBrecht himself, meanwhile, was appalled by even the residually\nnegative function of the aura, recording his response in\nhis Workbook: \u201cit is all mysticism mysticism, in a\nposture opposed to mysticism. \u2026 it is rather ghastly\u201d\n(cited in Buck-Morss 1977, 149). Yet Adorno did not defend\n\u2018auratic art\u2019 as such. (His defence of autonomous art was\ngrounded on the experience derived from following the\n\u2018autonomous\u2019 technical development of laws of form.)\n\nClearly, the concept of the aura plays a number of different roles\nin Benjamin\u2019s writings, in his various attempts to grasp his\nhistorical present in terms of the possibilities for\n\u2018experience\u2019 afforded by its new cultural forms; which he\nincreasingly came to identify (some say precipitously) with\nrevolutionary political potential. Yet Adorno was wrong to see a simple\nchange of position, rather than a complex series of inflections of what\nwas a generally consistent historical account. Benjamin had written\naffirmatively of \u201cthe emancipation of object from aura\u201d as\nearly as 1931, in his \u2018Little History of Photography\u2019, in\nwhich he described Atget\u2019s photographs as \u201csuck[ing] the\naura out of reality like water from a sinking ship\u201d (SW 2, 518).\nIt is here that we find the basic definition of aura: \u201cA strange\nweave of space and time: the unique appearance or semblance of\ndistance, no matter how close it may be.\u201d Importantly, the\nexamples given with this definition are from nature: mountains and a\nbranch observed \u201cat rest on a summer\u2019s noon \u2026 until\nthe moment or the hour become part of their appearance\u2026\u201d.\nThe \u2018destruction\u2019 of the aura by transience and\nreproducibility is judged \u201ca salutary estrangement\u201d (SW 2,\n518\u20139). Similarly, when \u2018The Storyteller\u2019 recounts\nthe \u201cdying out of the art of storytelling\u201d and \u201cthe\nincomparable aura that surrounds the storyteller\u201d, it is\nnonetheless maintained: \u201cnothing could be more fatuous than to\nwish to see it as merely a \u2018symptom of decay\u2019, let alone a\n\u2018modern symptom\u2019. It is rather, only a concomitant of the\nsecular productive forces of history\u2026\u201d (SW 3, 146; 162).\n\u2018The Work of Art\u2019 essay extends and enriches the earlier\naccount of photography\u2019s technological transformation of\nperception (\u201cthe optical unconscious\u201d) with reference to\nfilm. The difference resides in the insistent political dimension of\nthe later essay (after Hitler\u2019s taking of power in 1933), and its\ndetermination to introduce concepts \u201cthat are completely useless\nfor the purposes of fascism\u201d (SW 3, 102). The main problem with\nthe auratic (which is deemed historically residual, not eliminated,\nindeed is perhaps ineliminable [Didi-Huberman 2004]) was that, Benjamin\nbelieved, it was precisely \u201cuseful for fascism\u201d. This\ncontext over-determines the essay throughout, with its almost Manichean\noppositions between ritual and politics, cult value and exhibition\nvalue. Quite apart from the intervening technological and social\ndevelopments, it makes it a very difficult text simply to\n\u2018use\u2019 today. For some, however, it is precisely the\nconnection it draws between a certain kind of mass culture and fascism\nthat provides its continuing relevance (Buck-Morss 1992).\n",
