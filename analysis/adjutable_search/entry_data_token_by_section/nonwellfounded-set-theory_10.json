    "main_text": "Using AFA || Doing without AFA\n3.2 Doing without AFA\n\nOur work on bisimulation above can be used to effect a \nreduction of the of non-wellfounded sets to that of ordinary sets,\nmuch in the spirit of what we saw for streams and functions in\nSection 1.1.\n    There are several ways to \ndescribe such a reduction.   \n\n\nA pointed graph is a triple  (G,\u2192, g) \n such that  \u2192  is \na relation on G\n and g\u2009\u2208\u2009 G.\n   A bisimulation\n between pointed graphs  (G,\u2192, g)  and \n  (H,\u21d2, h)  \nis a bisimulation  R\n between  (G,\u2192)  and \n (H,\u21d2)   such that\ng \u2009 R \u2009 h.  \n\n\nIn the remainder of this discussion, we let \np, q,  \u2026  denote \npointed graphs.    We write   p \u2261b\nq\n if there is a bisimulation\nbetween p and q.   We write \np \u03b5\nq\n if\nthere is a pointed graph  (G,\u2192, g)\n and some g \u2192 h\nin G\n so that\n\n\n\np \u2261\n (G,\u2192, h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0\nq  \u2261\n (G,\u2192, g).\n\n\n\nSentences in the language of set theory talk about sets, and\nwe translate them to sentences about pointed graphs by \nrestricting all quantifiers to the class of pointed graphs, and then\ntranslating \u2208 to \u03b5, and \u2261 for  =.  For\nexample, the Axiom of Extensionality\n\n\n\u2200x,y(x=y \u2192 \n \u2200z(z \u2208 x \u2192\n z \u2208 y)).\n\n\n\nwould translate to (where p, q, r range over\npointed graphs):\n\n\n\n\u2200p,q(p \u2261 q \u2192\n \u2200r(r \u03b5 p \u2192\n r \u03b5 q)).\n\n\n\nThis last sentence is then provable.  (Hint: the union of any set\nof bisimulations on a graph is again a bisimulation on it.)\n\n\nIndeed, all of the axioms of ZFA are provable, including AFA.\nThis is a fairly long and tedious verification, but it is not so tricky.    \n  A version of it\n(for set theory with urelements, objects which are not sets)\nis the topic of a chapter in Barwise and Moss (1996).\n\n\nOne can also go further: instead of translating the identity relation\n =  into something more complex, we may keep the language simple\nand complicate the interpretation.   We would like to replace \u201cpointed graph\u201d\nby \u201c\u2261-class of pointed graph\u201d. Since these are not sets, we instead\nemploy Scott\u2019s trick and instead use \u201cset of \nwell-founded pointed graphs whose node sets are \n\u2261-equivalent\nand with the property that no pointed graph of smaller rank is \nalso  \u2261-equivalent to them.\u201d\n\n\nDoing all of this leads to relative consistency result:\n\n\nTheorem.\nIf   ZFC is consistent, then so is   ZFA,\nand vice-versa.\n\n",
