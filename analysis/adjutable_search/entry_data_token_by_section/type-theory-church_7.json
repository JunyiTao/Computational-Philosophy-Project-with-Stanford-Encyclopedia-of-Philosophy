The principle\nwas extended to elementary type theory by Andrews (1971) and to\nextensional type theory, that is, Henkin\u2019s general semantics\nwithout description or choice, by Benzm\u00fcller, Brown and Kohlhase\n(2004). We outline these extensions in some more detail below.\n3.3.1 Elementary Type Theory\n\nThe Unifying Principle was extended to elementary type theory (the\nsystem \\(\\cT\\) of\n Section 1.3.2)\n in Andrews 1971 by applying ideas in Takahashi 1967. This Unifying\nPrinciple for \\(\\cT\\) has been used to establish cut-elimination for\n\\(\\cT\\) in Andrews 1971 and completeness proofs for various systems of\ntype theory in Huet 1973a, Kohlhase 1995, and Miller 1983. We first\ngive a definition and then state the principle.\n\nDefinition. A property \\(\\Gamma\\) of finite sets of\nwffs\\(_{{o}}\\) is an abstract consistency property iff for\nall finite sets \\(\\cS\\) of wffs\\(_{{o}}\\), the following properties\nhold (for all wffs A, B):\n\nIf \\(\\Gamma(\\cS)\\), then there is no atom \\(\\bA\\) such that \\(\\bA\n\\in \\cS\\) and \\([\\nsim \\bA] \\in \\cS\\).\nIf \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{\\bA\\})\\), then \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup {\\downarrow}\n\\bA\\})\\).\nIf \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{\\nsim \\nsim \\bA\\})\\), then \\(\\Gamma(\\cS\n\\cup \\{\\bA\\})\\).\nIf \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{\\bA \\lor \\bB\\})\\), then \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup\n\\{\\bA\\})\\) or \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{\\bB\\})\\).\nIf \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{\\nsim[\\bA \\lor \\bB]\\})\\), then \\(\\Gamma(\\cS\n\\cup \\{\\nsim \\bA,\\nsim \\bB\\})\\).\nIf \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{\\Pi_{{o}({o}\\alpha)}\\bA_{{o}\\alpha}\\})\\),\nthen \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{\\Pi_{{o}({o}\\alpha)}\\bA_{{o}\\alpha},\n\\bA_{{o}\\alpha}\\bB_{\\alpha}\\})\\) for each wff \\(\\bB_{\\alpha}\\).\nIf \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{\\nsim\n\\Pi_{{o}({o}\\alpha)}\\bA_{{o}\\alpha}\\})\\), then \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup\n\\{\\nsim \\bA_{{o}\\alpha}\\bc_{\\alpha}\\})\\), for any variable or\nparameter \\(\\bc_{\\alpha}\\) which does not occur free in\n\\(\\bA_{{o}\\alpha}\\) or any wff in \\(\\cS\\).\n\n\nNote that consistency is an abstract consistency\nproperty.\n\nUnifying Principle for \\(\\cT\\). If \\(\\Gamma\\) is an\nabstract consistency property and \\(\\Gamma(\\cS)\\), then \\(\\cS\\) is\nconsistent in \\(\\cT\\).\n\nHere is a typical application of the Unifying Principle. Suppose there\nis a procedure \\(\\cM\\) which can be used to refute sets of sentences,\nand we wish to show it is complete for \\(\\cT\\). For any set of\nsentences, let \\(\\Gamma(\\cS)\\) mean that \\(\\cS\\) is not refutable by\n\\(\\cM\\), and show that \\(\\Gamma\\) is an abstract consistency property.\nNow suppose that \\(\\bA\\) is a theorem of \\(\\cT\\). Then \\(\\{\\nsim\n\\bA\\}\\) is inconsistent in \\(\\cT\\), so by the Unifying Principle not\n\\(\\Gamma(\\{\\nsim \\bA\\})\\), so \\(\\{\\nsim \\bA\\}\\) is refutable by\n\\(\\cM\\).\n3.3.2 Extensional Type Theory\n\nExtensions of the above Unifying principle towards Church\u2019s type\ntheory with general semantics were studied since the mid nineties. A\nprimary motivation was to support (refutational) completeness\ninvestigations for the proof calculi underlying the emerging\nhigher-order automated theorem provers (see\n Section 4\n below). The initial interest was on a fragment of Church\u2019s type\ntheory, called extensional type theory, that includes the\nextensionality axioms, but excludes \\(\\iota_{(\\alpha({o}\\alpha))}\\)\nand the axioms for it (description and choice were largely neglected\nin the automated theorem provers at the time). Analogous to before, a\ndistinction has been made between extensional type theory with\ndefined equality (as in\n Section 1.2.1,\n where equality is defined via Leibniz\u2019 principle) and\nextensional type theory with primitive equality (e.g., system\n\\(\\cQ_0\\) as in\n Section 1.4,\n or, alternatively, a system based on logical constants\n\\(\\nsim_{({o}{o})}, \\lor_{(({o}{o}){o})}\\), and the\n\\(\\Pi_{({o}({o}\\alpha))}\\)\u2019s as in\n Section 1.2.1,\n but with additional primitive logical constants\n\\(=_{{o}\\alpha\\alpha}\\) added).\n\nA first attempt towards a Unifying Principle for extensional type\ntheory with primitive equality is presented in Kohlhase 1993. The\nconditions given there, which are still\n incomplete[1],\n were subsequently modified and complemented as follows:\n\n\n\nTo obtain a Unifying Principle for extensional type theory with\ndefined equality, Benzm\u00fcller & Kohlhase 1997 added the\nfollowing conditions for boolean extensionality, functional\nextensionality and saturation to the above conditions 1.-7. for\n\\(\\cT\\) (their presentation has been adapted here; for technical reasons,\nthey also employ a slightly stronger variant for condition 2. based on\n\u03b2-conversion rather than \u03b2-normalization):\n\nIf \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\bA_{{o}} = \\bB_{{o}} \\})\\), then\n\\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\bA_{{o}}, \\bB_{{o}} \\})\\) or \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\nsim \\bA_{{o}}, \\nsim \\bB_{{o}} \\})\\)\nIf \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\bA_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\bB_{\\alpha\\beta}\n\\})\\), then \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\bA_{\\alpha\\beta} \\bc_\\beta =\n\\bB_{\\alpha\\beta} \\bc_\\beta \\})\\) for any parameter \\(\\bc_{\\beta}\\)\nwhich does not occur free in \\(\\cS\\).\n\\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\bA_{{o}} \\})\\) or \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\nsim\n\\bA_{{o}} \\})\\)\n\n\nThe saturation condition 10. was required to properly establish the\nprinciple. However, since this condition is related to the proof\ntheoretic notion of cut-elimination, it limits the utility of the\nprinciple in completeness proofs for machine-oriented calculi. The\nprinciple was nevertheless used in Benzm\u00fcller & Kohlhase\n1998a and Benzm\u00fcller 1999a,b to obtain a completeness proof for a\nsystem of extensional higher-order resolution. The principle was also\napplied in Kohlhase 1998 to study completeness for a related\nextensional higher-order tableau\n calculus,[2]\n in which the extensionality rules for Leibniz equality were adapted\nfrom Benzm\u00fcller & Kohlhase 1998a, respectively\nBenzm\u00fcller 1997.\n\n\nDifferent options for achieving a Unifying Principle for extensional\ntype theory with primitive equality are presented in Benzm\u00fcller\n1999a (in this work primitive logical constants\n\\(=_{{o}\\alpha\\alpha}\\) were used in addition to \\(\\nsim_{({o}{o})},\n\\lor_{(({o}{o}){o})}\\), and the \\(\\Pi_{({o}({o}\\alpha))}\\)\u2019s;\nsuch a redundant choice of logical constants is not rare in\nhigher-order theorem provers). One option is to introduce a\nreflexivity and substitutivity condition. An alternative is to combine\na reflexivity condition with a condition connecting primitive with\ndefined equality, so that the substitutivity condition follows. Note\nthat introducing a defined notion of equality based on the Leibniz\nprinciple is, of course, still possible in this context (defined\nequality is denoted in the remainder of this section by \\(\\doteq\\) to\nproperly distinguish it from primitive equality \\(=\\)):\n\nNot \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\nsim [\\bA_{\\alpha} = \\bA_{\\alpha}]\n\\})\\)\nIf \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\bA_{\\alpha} = \\bA_{\\alpha} \\})\\), then\n\\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\bA_{\\alpha} \\doteq \\bA_{\\alpha} \\})\\)\n\\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\bA_{{o}} \\})\\) or \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\nsim\n\\bA_{{o}} \\})\\)\n\n\nThe saturation condition 10. still has to be added independent of\nwhich option is considered. The principle was applied in\nBenzm\u00fcller 1999a,b to\nprove completeness for the extensional higher-order\n RUE-resolution[3]\n calculus underlying the higher-order automated theorem prover LEO and\nits successor LEO-II.\n\n\nIn Benzm\u00fcller et al. 2004 the principle is presented in a very\ngeneral way which allows for various possibilities concerning the\ntreatment of extensionality and equality in the range between\nelementary type theory and extensional type theory. The principle is\napplied to obtain completeness proofs for an associated range of\nnatural deduction calculi. The saturation condition is still used in\nthis work.\n\n\nBased on insights from Brown\u2019s (2004, 2007) thesis, a solution\nfor replacing the undesirable saturation condition by two weaker\nconditions is presented in Benzm\u00fcller, Brown, and Kohlhase 2009;\nthis work also further studies the relation between saturation and\ncut-elimination. The two weaker conditions, termed mating and\ndecomposition, are easier to demonstrate than saturation in\ncompleteness proofs for machine-oriented calculi. They are (omitting\nsome type information in the second one and abusing notation):\n\nIf \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\nsim \\bA_{{o}}, \\bB_{{o}} \\})\\) for atoms\n\\(\\bA_{{o}}\\) and \\(\\bB_{{o}}\\), then \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\nsim [\\bA_{{o}} \\doteq \\bB_{{o}}] \\})\\)\nIf \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\nsim [h \\overline{\\bA^n_{\\alpha^n}}\n\\doteq h \\overline{\\bB^n_{\\alpha^n}} ] \\})\\), where head symbol\n\\(h_{\\beta\\overline{\\alpha^n}}\\) is a parameter, then there is an \\(i\\\n(1 \\leq i \\leq n)\\) such that \\(\\Gamma(\\cS \\cup \\{ \\nsim [\\bA^i_{\\alpha^i} \\doteq \\bB^i_{\\alpha^i}]\n\\})\\).\n\n\nThe modified principle is applied in Benzm\u00fcller et al. 2009 to\nshow completeness for a sequent calculus for extensional type theory\nwith defined equality.\n\n\nA further extended Unifying Principle for extensional type theory with\nprimitive equality is presented and used in Backes & Brown 2011 to\nprove the completeness of a tableau calculus for type theory which\nincorporates the axiom of choice.\n\n\nA closely related and further simplified principle has also been\npresented and studied in Steen 2018, where it was applied for showing\ncompleteness of the paramodulation calculus (Steen 2018) that is\nunderlying the theorem prover Leo-III (Steen & Benzm\u00fcller\n2018).\n\n3.4 Cut-Elimination and Cut-Simulation\n\nCut-elimination proofs (see also the SEP entry on\n proof theory)\n for Church\u2019s type theory, which are often closely related to\nsuch proofs (Takahashi 1967, 1970; Prawitz 1968; Mints 1999) for other\nformulations of type theory, may be found in Andrews 1971, Dowek &\nWerner 2003, and Brown 2004. In Benzm\u00fcller et al. 2009 it is\nshown how certain wffs\\(_{{o}}\\), such as axioms of extensionality,\ndescriptions, choice (see\n Sections 1.3.3\n to\n 1.3.5),\n and induction, can be used to justify cuts in cut-free sequent\ncalculi for elementary type theory. Moreover, the notions of\ncut-simulation and cut-strong axioms are introduced\nin this work, and the need for omitting defined equality and for\neliminating cut-strong axioms such as extensionality,\ndescription, choice and induction in machine-oriented calculi (e.g.,\nby replacing them with more constrained, goal-directed rules) in order\nto reduce cut-simulation effects are discussed as a major\nchallenge for higher-order automated theorem proving. In other words,\nincluding cut-strong axioms in a machine-oriented proof calculus for\nChurch\u2019s type theory is essentially as bad as including a cut\nrule, since the cut rule can be mimicked by them.\n3.5 Expansion Proofs\n\nAn expansion proof is a generalization of the notion of a\nHerbrand expansion of a theorem of first-order logic; it provides a\nvery elegant, concise, and nonredundant representation of the\nrelationship between the theorem and a tautology which can be obtained\nfrom it by appropriate instantiations of quantifiers and which\nunderlies various proofs of the theorem. Miller (1987) proved that a\nwff \\(\\bA\\) is a theorem of elementary type theory if and only if\n\\(\\bA\\) has an expansion proof.\n\nIn Brown 2004 and 2007, this concept is generalized to that of an\nextensional expansion proof to obtain an analogous theorem\ninvolving type theory with extensionality.\n3.6 The Decision Problem\n\nSince type theory includes first-order logic, it is no surprise that\nmost systems of type theory are undecidable. However, one may look for\nsolvable special cases of the decision problem. For example, the\nsystem \\(\\cQ_{0}^1\\) obtained by adding to \\(\\cQ_0\\) the additional\naxiom \\(\\forall x_{\\imath}\\forall y_{\\imath}[x_{\\imath}=y_{\\imath}]\\)\nis decidable.\n\nAlthough the system \\(\\cT\\) of elementary type theory is analogous to\nfirst-order logic in certain respects, it is a considerably more\ncomplex language, and special cases of the decision problem for\nprovability in \\(\\cT\\) seem rather intractable for the most part.\nInformation about some very special cases of this decision problem may\nbe found in Andrews 1974, and we now summarize this.\n\nA wff of the form \\(\\exists \\bx^1 \\ldots \\exists \\bx^n [\\bA=\\bB]\\) is\na theorem of \\(\\cT\\) iff there is a substitution \\(\\theta\\) such that\n\\(\\theta \\bA \\conv \\theta \\bB\\). In particular, \\(\\vdash \\bA=\\bB\\) iff\n\\(\\bA \\conv \\bB\\), which solves the decision problem for wffs of the\nform \\([\\bA=\\bB]\\). Naturally, the circumstance that only trivial\nequality formulas are provable in \\(\\cT\\) changes drastically when\naxioms of extensionality are added to \\(\\cT\\). \\(\\vdash \\exists\n\\bx_{\\beta}[\\bA=\\bB]\\) iff there is a wff \\(\\bE_{\\beta}\\) such that\n\\(\\vdash[\\lambda \\bx_{\\beta}[\\bA=\\bB]]\\bE_{\\beta}\\), but the decision\nproblem for the class of wffs of the form \\(\\exists\n\\bx_{\\beta}[\\bA=\\bB]\\) is unsolvable.\n\nA wff of the form \\(\\forall \\bx^1 \\ldots \\forall \\bx^n\\bC\\), where\n\\(\\bC\\) is quantifier-free, is provable in \\(\\cT\\) iff \\({\\downarrow}\n\\bC\\) is tautologous. On the other hand, the decision problem for wffs\nof the form \\(\\exists \\bz\\bC\\), where \\(\\bC\\) is quantifier-free, is\nunsolvable. (By contrast, the corresponding decision problem in\nfirst-order logic with function symbols is known to be solvable\n(Maslov 1967).) Since irrelevant or vacuous quantifiers can always be\nintroduced, this shows that the only solvable classes of wffs of\n\\(\\cT\\) in prenex normal form defined solely by the structure of the\nprefix are those in which no existential quantifiers occur.\n4. Automation\n4.1 Machine-Oriented Proof Calculi\n\nThe development, respectively improvement, of machine-oriented proof\ncalculi for Church\u2019s type theory is still a challenge research\ntopic. Compared, e.g., to the theoretical and practical maturity\nachieved in first-order automated theorem proving, the area is still\nin its infancy. Obviously, the challenges are also much bigger than in\nfirst-order logic. The practically way more expressive nature of the\nterm-language of Church\u2019s type theory causes a larger, bushier\nand more difficult to traverse proof search space than in first-order\nlogic. Moreover, remember that unification, which constitutes a very\nimportant control and filter mechanism in first-order theorem proving,\nis undecidable (in general) in type theory; see\n Section 3.2.\n On the positive side, however, there is a chance to find\nsignificantly shorter proofs than in first-order logic. This is well\nillustrated with a small, concrete example in Boolos 1987. Clearly,\nmuch further progress is needed to further leverage the practical\nrelevance of existing calculi for Church\u2019s type theory and their\nimplementations (see\n Section 4.3).\n The challenges include\n\nan appropriate handling of the impredicative nature of\nChurch\u2019s type theory (some form of blind guessing cannot\ngenerally be avoided in a complete proof procedure, but must be\nintelligently guided),\nthe elimination/reduction of cut-simulation effects (see\n Section 3.4)\n caused by defined equality or cut-strong axioms (e.g.,\nextensionality, description, choice, induction) in the search\nspace,\nthe general undecidability of unification, rendering it a rather\nproblematic filter mechanism for controlling proof search,\nthe invention of suitable heuristics for traversing the search\nspace,\nthe provision of suitable term-orderings and their effective\nexploitation in term rewriting procedures,\nand the development of efficient data structures in combination\nwith strong technical support for essential operations such\n\u03bb-conversion, substitution and rewriting.\n\n\nIt is planned that future editions of this article further elaborate\non machine-oriented proof calculi for Church\u2019s type theory. For\nthe time being, however, we provide only a selection of historical and\nmore recent references for the interested reader (see also\n Section 5 below):\n\nSequent calculi: Sch\u00fctte 1960; Takahashi\n1970; Takeuti 1987; Mints 1999; Brown 2004, 2007; Benzm\u00fcller et\nal. 2009.\nMating method: Andrews 1981; Bibel 1981; Bishop\n1999.\nResolution calculi: Andrews 1971; Huet 1973a;\nJensen & Pietrzykowski 1976; Benzm\u00fcller 1997, 1999a;\nBenzm\u00fcller & Kohlhase 1998a. \nTableau method:\n Kohlhase[4]\n 1995, 1998; Brown & Smolka 2010; Backes & Brown 2011.\nParamodulation calculi: Benzm\u00fcller 1999a,b;\nSteen 2018.\n\n4.2 Early Proof Assistants\n\nEarly computer systems for proving theorems of Church\u2019s type\ntheory (or extensions of it) include HOL (Gordon 1988; Gordon &\nMelham 1993), TPS (Andrews et al. 1996; Andrews & Brown 2006),\nIsabelle (Paulson 1988, 1990), PVS (Owre et al. 1996; Shankar 2001),\nIMPS (Farmer et al. 1993), HOL\nLight (Harrison 1996), OMEGA (Siekmann et al. 2006), and \u03bbClam\n(Richardson et al. 1998). See\n Other Internet References\n section below for links to further info on these and other provers\nmentioned later. \n\nThe majority of the above systems focused (at least initially) on\ninteractive proof and provided rather limited support for additional\nproof automation. Full proof automation was pioneered, in particular,\nby the TPS project. Progress was made in the nineties, when other\nprojects started similar activities, respectively, enforced theirs.\nHowever, the resource investments and achievements were lacking much\nbehind those seen in first-order theorem proving. Significant progress\nwas fostered only later, in particular, through the development of a\ncommonly supported syntax for Church\u2019s type theory, called TPTP\nTHF (Sutcliffe & Benzm\u00fcller 2010), and the inclusion, from\n2009 onwards, of a TPTP THF division in the yearly CASC competitions\n(kind of world championships for automated theorem proving; see\nSutcliffe 2016 for further details).\n4.3 Automated Theorem Provers\n\nAn selection of theorem provers for Church\u2019s type theory is\npresented. The focus is on systems that have successfully participated\nin TPTP THF CASC competitions in the past. The latest editions of most\nmentioned systems can be accessed online via the SystemOnTPTP\ninfrastructure (Sutcliffe 2017). Nearly all mentioned systems produce\nverifiable proof certificates in the TPTP TSTP syntax. Further details\non the automation of Church\u2019s type theory are given in\nBenzm\u00fcller & Miller 2014.\n\nThe TPS prover (Andrews et al. 1996, Andrews & Brown 2006) can be\nused to prove theorems of elementary type theory or extensional type\ntheory automatically, interactively, or semi-automatically. When\nsearching for a proof automatically, TPS first searches for an\nexpansion proof (Miller 1987) or an extensional expansion proof (Brown\n2004, 2007) of the theorem. Part of this process involves searching\nfor acceptable matings (Andrews 1981, Bishop 1999). The behavior of\nTPS is controlled by sets of flags, also called modes. A simple\nscheduling mechanism is employed in the latest versions of TPS to\nsequentially run a about fifty modes for a limited amount of time. TPS\nwas the winner of the first THF CASC competition in 2009.\n\nThe LEO-II prover (Benzm\u00fcller et al. 2015) is the successor of\nLEO (Benzm\u00fcller & Kohlhase 1998b, which was hardwired with\nthe OMEGA proof assistant (LEO stands for Logical Engine of OMEGA).\nThe provers are based on the RUE-resolution calculi developed in\nBenzm\u00fcller 1999a,b. LEO\nwas the first prover to implement calculus rules for extensionality to\navoid cut-simulation effects. LEO-II inherits and adapts them, and\nprovides additional calculus rules for description and choice. The\nprover, which internally collaborates with first-order provers\n(preferably E) and SAT solvers, has pioneered cooperative\nhigher-order/first-order proof automation. Since the prover is often\ntoo weak to find a refutation among the steadily growing set of\nclauses on its own, some of the clauses in LEO-II\u2019s search space\nattain a special status: they are first-order clauses modulo the\napplication of an appropriate transformation function. Therefore,\nLEO-II progressively launches time limited calls with these clauses to\na first-order theorem prover, and when the first-order prover reports\na refutation, LEO-II also terminates. Parts of these ideas were\nalready implemented in the predecessor LEO. Communication between\nLEO-II and the cooperating first-order theorem provers uses the TPTP\nlanguage and standards. LEO-II was the winner of the second THF CASC\ncompetition in 2010.\n\nThe Satallax prover (Brown 2012) is based on a complete ground tableau\ncalculus for Church\u2019s type theory with choice (Backes &\nBrown 2011). An initial tableau branch is formed from the assumptions\nof a conjecture and negation of its conclusion. From that point on,\nSatallax tries to determine unsatisfiability or satisfiability of this\nbranch. Satallax progressively generates higher-order formulas and\ncorresponding propositional clauses. Satallax uses the SAT solver\nMiniSat as an engine to test the current set of propositional clauses\nfor unsatisfiability. If the clauses are unsatisfiable, the original\nbranch is unsatisfiable. Satallax provides calculus rules for\nextensionality, description and choice. If there are no quantifiers at\nfunction types, the generation of higher-order formulas and\ncorresponding clauses may terminate. In that case, if MiniSat reports\nthe final set of clauses as satisfiable, then the original set of\nhigher-order formulas is satisfiable (by a standard model in which all\ntypes are interpreted as finite sets). Satallax was the winner of the\nTHF CASC competition in 2011 and since 2013. \n\nThe Isabelle/HOL system (Nipkow, Wenzel, & Paulson 2002) has\noriginally been designed as an interactive prover. However, in order\nto ease user interaction several automatic proof tactics have been\nadded over the years. By appropriately scheduling a subset of these\nproof tactics, some of which are quite powerful, Isabelle/HOL has\nsince about 2011 been turned also into an automatic theorem prover for\nTPTP THF (and other TPTP syntax formats), that can be run from a\ncommand shell like other provers. The most powerful proof tactics that\nare scheduled by Isabelle/HOL include the Sledgehammer tool\n(Blanchette et al. 2013),\nwhich invokes a sequence of external first-order and higher-order\ntheorem provers, the model finder Nitpick (Blanchette &\nNipkow 2010), the equational reasoner simp, the untyped\ntableau prover blast, the simplifier and classical reasoners\nauto, force, and fast, and the best-first\nsearch procedure best. In contrast to all other automated\ntheorem provers mentioned above, the TPTP incarnation of Isabelle/HOL\ndoes not yet output proof certificates. Isabelle/HOL was the winner of\nthe THF CASC competition in 2012. \n\nThe agsyHOL prover is based on a generic lazy narrowing proof search\nalgorithm. Backtracking is employed and a comparably small search\nstate is maintained. The prover outputs proof terms in sequent style\nwhich can be verified in the Agda system. \n\ncoqATP implements (the non-inductive) part of the calculus of\nconstructions (Bertot & Cast\u00e9ran 2004). The system outputs\nproof terms which are accepted as proofs (after the addition of a few\ndefinitions) by the Coq proof assistant. The prover employs axioms for\nfunctional extensionality, choice, and excluded middle. Boolean\nextensionality is not supported. In addition to axioms, a small\nlibrary of basic lemmas is employed. \n\nThe Leo-III prover implements a paramodulation calculus for\nChurch\u2019s type theory (Steen 2018). The system, which is a\ndescendant of LEO and LEO-II, provides calculus rules for\nextensionality, description and choice. The system has put an emphasis\non the implementation of an efficient set of underlying data\nstructures, on simplification routines and on heuristic rewriting. In\nthe tradition of its predecessors, Leo-III cooperates with first-order\nreasoning tools using translations to many-sorted first-order logic.\nThe prover accepts every common TPTP syntax dialect and is thus very\nwidely applicable. Recently, the prover has also been extended to\nnatively supports almost every normal higher-order modal logic.\n\nZipperposition (Bentkamp et al. 2018) is new and inspiring\nhigher-order theorem prover which, at the current state of\ndevelopment, is still working for a comparably weak fragment of\nChurch\u2019s type theory, called lambda-free higher-order\nlogic (a comprehension-free higher-order logic,\nwhich is nevertheless supporting \u03bb-notation). The system, which\nis based on superposition calculi, is developed bottom up, and it is\nprogressively extended towards stronger fragments of Church\u2019s\ntype theory and to support other relevant extensions such datatypes,\nrecursive functions and arithmetic. \n\nVarious so called proof hammers, in the spirit of\nIsabelle\u2019s Sledgehammer tool, have recently been developed and\nintegrated with modern proof assistants. Prominent examples include\nHOL(y)Hammer (Kaliszyk & Urban 2015) for HOL Light and a similar\nhammer (Czaika & Kaliszyk 2018) for the proof assistant Coq. \n4.4 (Counter-)Model Finding\n\nSupport for finding finite models or countermodels for formulas of\nChurch\u2019s type theory was implemented already in the\ntableau-based prover HOT (Konrad 1998). Restricted (counter-)model\nfinding capabilities are also implemented in the provers Satallax,\nLEO-II and LEO-III. The most advanced (finite) model finding support\nis currently realized in the systems Nitpick, Nunchaku and Refute. These tools\nhave been integrated with the Isabelle proof assistant. Nitpick is\nalso available as a standalone tool that accepts TPTP THF syntax. The\nsystems are particularly valuable for exposing errors and\nmisconceptions in problem encodings, and for revealing bugs in the THF\ntheorem provers.\n5. Applications\n5.1 Semantics of Natural Language\n\nChurch\u2019s type theory plays an important role in the study of the\nformal semantics of natural language. Pioneering work on this was done\nby Richard Montague. See his papers \u201cEnglish as a formal\nlanguage\u201d, \u201cUniversal grammar\u201d, and \u201cThe\nproper treatment of quantification in ordinary English\u201d, which\nare reprinted in Montague 1974. A crucial component of\nMontague\u2019s analysis of natural language is the definition of a\ntensed intensional logic (Montague 1974: 256), which is an enhancement\nof Church\u2019s type theory. Montague Grammar had a huge impact, and\nhas since been developed in many further directions, not least in\nTypelogical/Categorical Grammar. Further related work on intensional\nand higher-order modal logic is presented in Gallin 1975 and Muskens\n2006.\n5.2 Mathematics and Computer Science\n\nProof assistants based on Church\u2019s Type Theory, including\nIsabelle/HOL, HOL Light, HOL4, and PVS, have been successfully\nutilized in a broad range of application in computer science and\nmathematics.\n\nApplications in computer science include the verification of hardware,\nsoftware and security protocols. A prominent example is the\nL4.verified project in which Isabelle/HOL was used to formally prove\nthat the seL4 operating system kernel implements an abstract,\nmathematical model specifying of what the kernel is supposed to do\n(Klein et al. 2018). \n\nIn mathematics proof assistants have been applied for the development\nof libraries mathematical theories and the verification of challenge\ntheorems. An early example is the mathematical library that was\ndeveloped since the eighties in the TPS project. A exemplary list of\ntheorems that were proved automatically with TPS is given in Andrews\net al. 1996. A very prominent recent example is Hales Flyspeck in\nwhich HOL Light was employed to develop a formal proof for\nKepler\u2019s conjecture (Hales et al. 2017). An example that\nstrongly exploits automation support in Isabelle/HOL with Sledgehammer\nand Nitpick is presented in Benzm\u00fcller & Scott forthcoming.\nIn this work different axiom systems for category theory were explored\nand compared. \n\nA solid overview on past and ongoing formalization projects can be\nobtained by consulting respective sources such as Isabelle\u2019s\nArchive of Formal Proofs, the Journal of Formalized Reasoning, or the\nTHF entries in Sutcliffe\u2019s TPTP problem library. \n\nFurther improving proof automation within these proof\nassistants\u2014based on proof hammering tools or on other forms of\nprover integration\u2014is relevant for minimizing interaction effort\nin future applications. \n5.3 Computational Metaphysics and Artificial Intelligence\n\nChurch\u2019s type theory is a Classical logic, but topical\napplications in philosophy and artificial intelligence often require\nexpressive non-classical logics. In order to support such applications\nwith reasoning tools for Church\u2019s type theory, the shallow\nsemantical embedding technique (see also\n Section 1.2.2)\n has been developed that generalizes and extends the ideas underlying\nthe well known standard translation of modal logics to first-order\nlogic. The technique was applied for the assessment of modern variants\nof the ontological argument with a range of higher-order theorem\nprovers, including LEO-II, Satallax, Nitpick and Isabelle/HOL. In the\ncourse of experiments, LEO-II detected an inconsistency in the\npremises of G\u00f6del\u2019s argument, while the provers succeeded\nin automatically proving Scott\u2019s emendation of it and to confirm\nthe consistency of the emended premises. More details on this work are\npresented in a related SEP entry on\n automated reasoning\n (see Section 4.6 on Logic and Philosophy). The semantical embedding\napproach has been adapted and further extended for a range of other\nnon-classical logics and related applications. In philosophy this\nincludes the encoding and formal assessment of ambitious ethical and\nmetaphysical theories, and in artificial intelligence this includes\nthe mechanization of deontic logics and normative reasoning as well as\nan automatic proof of the\n muddy children puzzle (see Appendix B of dynamic epistemic logic),\n which is a famous puzzle in epistemic reasoning, respectively dynamic\nepistemic reasoning.",
