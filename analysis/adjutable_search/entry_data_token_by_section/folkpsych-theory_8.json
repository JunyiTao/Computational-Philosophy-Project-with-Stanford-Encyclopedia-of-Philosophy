    "main_text": "Philosophical Challenges to Theory Theory || Eliminativism\n4.1 Eliminativism\n\nTTists assume that mature scientific psychology and FP both offer up\ntheories that are in precisely the same line of work\u2014namely,\nthat of causally explaining behavior. Yet, to the extent the mature\nscientific psychology and FP compete in this domain, the latter looks\nlike a poor contender.\n\nGood theories run deep. They are based on hard-won knowledge of\nunderlying causes rather than on generalizations based on surface\ndata. Good theories provide a powerful means of anticipating,\nexplaining, and controlling what happens. They do so by tapping into\nthe world of the unseen and the abstract. A good theory allows us to\nmake solid bets that pay off quickly and selectively, using minimal\nevidence. Good theories reliably guide expectations, even in novel\ncircumstances.\n\nThe key question then is: If FP is a theory of everyday human\npsychology, is it a good theory? Some argue, given what we already\nknow and are likely to discover, that is almost certainly a false\ntheory. Some think it is so poor that we have reason to think the\nstates over which it quantifies do not exist. Going by\nChurchland\u2019s (1981) assessment, we have every reason to think\nFP\u2019s principles are false and its ontology is an illusion.\nChurchland (1979, 1989, 1993) highlights FP\u2019s lack of unity and\nfit with a growing body of theory elsewhere in the sciences. Others\nagree. Rosenberg (2018), for example, maintains that modern\nneuroscience directly refutes FP proposals about the true causes of\nhuman behavior.\n\nWithout the benefit of a sustained and thriving scientific research\nprogram, FP seems to be, at most, a low-grade theory that is in\ntension with the best theories of mind that the mature cognitive\nsciences are developing. Many suppose that the advancing theories of\ncognitive science and neuroscience offer a deeper and more accurate\nmeans of understanding mind and cognition (see Carruthers 2011; Heyes\n2018; Rosenberg 2018; see Horgan & Woodward 1985 for a defense of\nFP on this score).\n\nIt has been argued that as long as we assume FP is any kind of ToM\nthen it won\u2019t remain in the theoretical running unless it allows\nfor revision and is prepared to incorporate the latest findings of\nmature scientific theorizing about minds (Murphy 2006; Gerrans 2014).\nAssuming FP is not open to such significant, open-ended revision,\nChurchland (1989) famously characterizes it as a stagnant or\ndegenerating research program.\n\nEliminativists regard FP\u2019s theoretical commitments as backward\nand outdated. FP is often compared to rejected theories that sought to\nexplain diseases by appeal to witches as opposed to germs.\nImportantly, a ToM can be an imperfect, false theory that fosters only\nillusions even if it is hardwired in our brains. If so, FP is a bad\ntheory that we, as a species, may find it hard to shake because we are\nuniversally pre-set to acquire it due to its quick and dirty utility\nin everyday contexts.\n\nOther reasons have been offered for thinking that FP is an inferior\ntheory when compared to the theories of scientific psychology. It has\nbeen argued that the contents of propositional attitudes are\nnecessarily world-relating in a way that requires us to look beyond\nthe bounds of an organism\u2019s skin when assigning contents to such\nattitudes (Stich 1983). On this analysis, the ways we attribute mental\nstate concepts and contents involves recourse to \u201csimilarity\nconditions\u201d and normative principles of charity that could not\npossibly feature in a mature science of the mind (Davidson 1984,\n1987). On this view, FP involves the ascription of contentful\nattitudes by employing interpretative methods that are inescapably\nbound up with norms of rationality. For those persuaded by such\narguments, to the extent that FP is properly characterized as a theory\nat all, it must be regarded as a domestic theory of very limited\nscope: one that is unfit to predict or explain the behavior of exotic\nsubjects, such as very young children and animals (Stich 1983). If\nthis analysis is correct, it reveals FP to be inherently wedded to an\nexplanatory schema that is incompatible with the demands of serious\nscientific psychology.\n\nTo the extent that FP embeds such features, it breaks faith with the\nalleged central tenet of any bona fide scientific\npsychology\u2014namely, that proper causal explanations should only\ncite proximate causes of action, those located physically, inside the\nskin of agents (Fodor 1981; McGinn 1989). For those persuaded by this\nline of argument FP will be incapable of providing causal explanations\nof action if it turns out that the content of propositional attitudes\nneeds to be individuated by factors that necessarily require looking\nbeyond an agent\u2019s skin.\n",
