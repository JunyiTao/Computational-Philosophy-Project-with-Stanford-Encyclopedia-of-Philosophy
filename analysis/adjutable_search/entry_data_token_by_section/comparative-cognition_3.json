    "main_text": "Evolution, Development, and Culture || Culture\n1.3 Culture\n\nIn addition to evolutionary and developmental factors, comparative\ncognition researchers aim to understand how cultural factors affect\ncognitive capacities. Philosophers and scientists have also argued\nthat understanding animal cultures has important implications for\nconservation efforts (Brakes et al. 2019) and animal welfare\n(Fitzpatrick & Andrews 2022). Broadly, culture can be defined\nas\n\n\ninformation transmitted between individuals or groups, where this\ninformation flows through and brings about the reproduction of, and a\nlasting change in, the behavioral trait. (Ramsey 2017: 348; see also\nRamsey 2013; Andrews 2015 [2020]: chapter 8; and entry on\n cultural evolution)\n\n\nFor example, the skills required to use a tool effectively might be\ntransmitted through social learning (such as copying), creating a\nlasting change in a recipient\u2019s subsequent behavioral abilities\nand reproductive fitness. Cultural transmission has been described as\na form of \u201csoft inheritance\u201d or the idea that organisms\ncan inherit phenotypic variation that is the result of non-genetic\neffects (Mayr 1982). Eva Jablonka and colleagues argue that many\nanimal traditions are transmitted in this way (Avital & Jablonka\n2000; Jablonka & Lamb 2008). For example, the behavioral\ninnovation of opening milk bottles spread quickly through Eurasian\nblue tit populations in the early twentieth century. Studies suggest\nthat this innovation spread through a mixture of local enhancement\n(na\u00efve birds learning that milk bottles are a source of food by\nspending time near birds capable of exploiting this food source) and\nobservational learning (na\u00efve birds copying the behavior of\nexperienced innovators) (Aplin, Sheldon, & Morand-Ferron\n2013).\n\nOne advantage of understanding culture in terms of soft inheritance is\nthat some of the methods and models employed in the study of\nbiological evolution can be applied to the study of culture (Mesoudi,\nWhiten, & Laland 2006). Rachael Brown (2017a) also argues that\nanimal traditions are important for understanding genetic evolution.\nFor example, recent studies suggest that the diversification of beak\nmorphologies in Gal\u00e1pagos finches is the result of behavioral\nforaging innovations spread through cultural transmission. The\npresence and spread of these behavioral innovations (e.g., using\none\u2019s beak to puncture the skin and drink the blood of sea\nbirds, as in the case of \u201cvampire finches\u201d) may have been\nrequired to allow sufficient selective pressure for morphological\nadaptation to occur. Despite the links between culture and genetic\nevolution, there remains disagreement regarding whether the modern\nsynthesis in evolutionary biology should be extended to include\nprocesses such as soft inheritance (see Pigliucci 2007; Laland et al.\n2015). Nevertheless, research on animal culture is flourishing with\nobservational and experimental studies revealing both its cognitive\nunderpinnings and effects (see Whiten 2022 for a recent review).\n",
