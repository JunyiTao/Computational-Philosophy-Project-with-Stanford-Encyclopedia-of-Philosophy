    "main_text": "Political Theory || Sovereignty and its limits\n2.3 Sovereignty and its limits\n\nCommon Sense might presume a principle of collective\nself-determination and the sovereignty of the people, but it does not\narticulate or defend it. Something like this issue does come under\nconsideration in Paine\u2019s Dissertations on Government, a\npamphlet written in 1786, defending the Bank of America and the\nprinciple that contracts formed by government ought to be respected by\nsubsequent occupants of power. \u2018Every government\u2026contains\nwithin itself a principle common to all, which is that of a sovereign\npower, or a power over which there is no control, and which controls\nall others\u2026.In republics, such as those established in America,\nthe sovereign power\u2026remains where nature placed it\u2014in the\npeople. \u2026This sovereignty is exercised in electing and deputing\na certain number of persons to represent and to act for the whole. But\nhe goes on to insist that\n\nWhen a people agree to form themselves into a republic\u2026it is\nunderstood that they mutually resolve and pledge themselves to each\nother, rich and poor alike, to support this rule of equal justice\namong them\u2026 (and) they renounce as detestable, the power of\nexercising, at any future time any species of despotism over each\nother, or of doing a thing not right in itself, because a majority of\nthem may have the strength of numbers sufficient to accomplish it. (CW\nII, 373)\n\n\nAs a result,\n\nThe sovereignty in a republic is exercised to keep right and wrong in\ntheir proper and distinct places, and never suffer the one to usurp\nthe place of the other. A republic, properly understood, is a\nsovereignty of justice, in contradistinction to a sovereignty of will.\n(CW II, 375)\n\n\nThis position sits uncomfortably with more direct and active\ninterpretations of the sovereignty of the people or any general will.\nHence Paine\u2019s claim in 1791 to be \u2018a Citizen of a country\nwhich knows no other Majesty than that of the People; no other\nGovernment than that of the Representative body; no other sovereignty\nthan that of the Laws\u2026\u2019 (CW II, 1315).\n\nPaine\u2019s account of sovereignty dramatically delimits collective\npower to the securing of civil rights, based on natural right. In\nRights of Man (1791) he quotes Lafayette\u2019s claim that\n\u2018For a nation to be free it is sufficient that she wills\nit\u2019 (CW I, 322). Lafayette most likely meant it as a call to\nreject despotism; but Paine\u2019s account is perhaps more subtle,\nseeing it as a right of the nation to determine its government, but\nalso as a right that is itself delimited by the end of\nliberty\u2014that is, by the protection of individual rights and by\nensuring their more adequate security within the collective.\n\nThat this is so helps account for Paine\u2019s account of\ngenerational sovereignty. In Rights of Man (1791) he attacks\nBurke\u2019s claim that the terms of the 1688 Revolution Settlement\n\u201cbind us,\u201d (meaning the people of the day) \u201cour\nheirs and our posterity, to them, their\nheirs and posterity, to the end of time\u201d (CW\nI, 250). Paine demurs:\n\n\nThere never did, there never will, there never can exist a parliament,\nor any description of men, or any generation of men, in any country,\npossessed of the right or the power of binding and controlling\nposterity to the \u2018end of time\u2019\u2026Every\ngeneration must be as free to act for itself, in all cases,\nas the ages and generation which preceded it.\n\n\nThis too looks like a principle that Paine worked out with Jefferson,\nin 1788\u20139, when Jefferson first mentions it in his\ncorrespondence, although the prior source is likely to be Adam\nSmith\u2019s Wealth of Nations. The principle is a powerful\none\u2014but it is negative: no generation can be bound by those\nbefore it; and none can bind those after. But equally, no generation\nis free to act unjustly. In his Dissertations of Government\n(1786), Paine had struggled with precisely this issue in wanting to\nclaim both the sovereign power of the people and the duty on the part\nof the state to respect contracts made previously by others in their\ncapacity of representatives. Paine tries to reconcile the claims by\narguing that a contract is not a law but an action, and while laws can\nbe changed, acts are binding. He does not yet claim generational\nsovereignty, although the right to change laws is clearly there. But\nthe insistence on a sovereignty of justice is designed to ensure that\nactions that involve the transfer of rights must have the protection\nof the state and cannot be justly abrogated.\n\nWhat becomes clear, is that, as Paine struggles to articulate his\naccount of rights, he comes to defend a very Lockean account in which\nthe government is there to interpret and to secure antecedently\ndefined rights and just claims that are the outcome of the exercise of\nthese rights. Rights acquired through clear contract or agreement\ndeserve every protection: even if subsequent generations are at\nliberty to question the laws of the nation and to alter them as they\nwill, they are not at liberty to invade the property rights of people\nsecured through past agreements.\n",
