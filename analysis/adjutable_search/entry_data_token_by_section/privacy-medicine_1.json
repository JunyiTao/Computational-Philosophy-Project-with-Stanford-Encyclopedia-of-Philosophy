    "main_text": "Informational Privacy || Confidentiality\n1.1 Confidentiality\n\n\u201cPrivacy\u201d in medicine often denotes the confidentiality of\npatient-provider encounters (including the very fact that an encounter\nhas taken place), along with the secrecy and security of information\nmemorialized in physical, digital, electronic and graphic records\ncreated as a consequence of patient-provider encounters (DeCew 2000;\nParent 1983). Confidentiality is defined as restricting information to\npersons belonging to a set of specifically authorized recipients\n(Allen 1997; Kenny 1982). Confidentiality can be achieved through\nprofessional silence and secure data management (Sharpe 2005; Baer et\nal. 2002). Hence Sissela Bok characterized confidentiality as\nreferring \u201cto the boundaries surrounding shared secrets and to\nthe process of guarding these boundaries\u201d (Bok 1982: 119). \n\nPhilosophers have suggested new ways of conceptualizing familiar\nprivacy and confidentiality issues, pushing the topic of privacy and\nmedicine into less traveled directions or novel frames. For example,\nit has been proposed that privacy and confidentiality in medical\npractice eschew the traditional imperative of individual patient\nautonomy in favor of a relational understanding that welcomes families\nand support networks into a confidential circle with patients and\ncaregivers (Mohapatra and Wiley 2020). It has been proposed that\ntraditional physician-patient confidentiality laws should be\nunderstood to impose potentially unwanted secrecy onto physicians, who\nbear burdens of silence they might prefer not to bear but are in\neffect coerced to bear by legal liability to do so (Allen, 2011). \n\nPhilosophers tend to agree that health is a vital component of human\nflourishing (Faden et al. 2013; Moore 2005; R\u00f6ssler 2004;\nRosenberg 2000; Schoeman 1984; Boone 1983). Maimonides maintained that\nbodily health is among the means and ends of a good life (Weiss 1991).\nModern philosophers generally hold that a just society will be\ncommitted to securing the material and political bases of public\nhealth (Powers and Faden 2008). Philosophers of medicine, ethicists\nand bioethicists tend to agree that, with a handful of exceptions,\nrespecting patient confidentiality benefits both individual and public\nhealth (Kamoie and Hodge 2004). They defend the practice of\nconfidentiality by diverse appeals to utility, dignity and virtue\n(Easter et al. 2004).\n\nBuilding on the 5th century BCE Hippocratic tradition of\nmedical caregiver secrecy, western philosophers defend confidentiality\non several utilitarian or other consequentialist grounds (Frey 2000;\nHare 1993; Freedman 1978). They argue that preventive medicine, early\ndiagnosis and treatment save human lives and money. Individuals will\nbe more inclined to get medical attention if they believe they can do\nso privately. Policy experts maintain that the cost of health care and\ninsurance would be considerably higher if people avoided routine\ncheck-ups and prompt medical attention because confidentiality was not\ncredibly promised (Fairchild et al. 2007a). Confidentiality practices\nare believed to promote both seeking care and frank disclosures of\nhealth concerns in the context of care. Symptoms of illness and\ndecline, such as incontinence, memory loss, or hallucinations can be\nembarrassing to talk about, even with sympathetic professional\nclinicians. In addition, promises of confidentiality can make persons\nmore willing to participate in health research (Presidential\nCommission 2012; Easter et al. 2004).\n\nMedical confidentiality promotes the individual\u2019s medical\nautonomy, by sheltering those seeking morally controversial medical\ncare from outside criticism and interference with decisions (Dworkin\net al. 2007; Englehardt 2000a; Feinberg 1983). Patients seeking\ncosmetic, abortion or fertility treatments might not wish others to\nknow their plans. Members of the general public have from time to time\nattempted to influence choices strangers make relating to the care of\ndisabled infants, comatose or brain dead kin, and abortions. Spouses,\npartners, parents and siblings have sought involvement, with arguably\ngreater moral warrant. H.J. McCloskey suggested that loving personal\nrelationships call for mutual accountability (McCloskey 1971). Of\ncourse some health problems\u2014morbid obesity, scoliosis,\npsoriasis, paralysis\u2014simply cannot be concealed from intimates.\nBioethicists, consistent with public health considerations and laws,\ncommonly argue that hidden contagious conditions or exposures should\nnot be concealed from vulnerable associates and in extreme cases could\njustify non-voluntary isolation or public health quarantine\n(Presidential Commission 2015a).\n\nPhilosophers have also offered deontological grounds for protecting\ninformational privacy (Pierce 2018; Benn 1988). Centuries of\nphilosophical thought depict human beings as vulnerable bodies and\nself-aware souls (Lackoff and Johnson 1999). Informational privacy\npromotes respect for human dignity, philosophers have said. Caregivers\ndisplay concern for moral persons with rational interests and feelings\nof their own when they keep information about their health and health\nneeds private (Freedman 1978).\n\nIndividuals concerned about discrimination, shame or stigma have an\ninterest in controlling the flow of information about their health,\nand arguably the moral right to do so. Mental and other behavioral\nhealth care consumers continue to face stigma and discrimination in a\nworld in which getting what they need requires a virtual surrender of\nconfidentiality to a bevy of other people, including family members,\ndoctors, social workers, teachers, hospitals, insurers, and law\nenforcement (APA 2002; AAMFT 2001; Dickson 1998).\n\nNotions of moral fairness play into arguments for confidentiality.\nConfidentiality is arguably required by fair relations with government\nand businesses (Workplace Fairness, 2009,\n Other Internet Resources).\n Since \u201cknowledge is power\u201d, special concerns have been\nraised about the manner in which government collects and manages\npersonal medical information. Pervasive ideals of fair information\npractices require that personal data collected about individuals be\nlimited, accurate, secure and disclosed to third-parties only with\nconsent. Some patients believe they own personal information about\nthemselves, and that is it only fair that they, not others, control\nits release (McGuire 2019). They may believe they own medical\ninformation because they have purchased medical services (Martin 1981:\n624\u201325). Or they may believe they own medical information,\nespecially genetic information, because it reveals information of a\nhighly personal and unique sort (Laurie 2002; Rothstein 1997).\n\nPhilosophers have identified duties of welfare promotion, care,\ndignity and fairness to support the case for privacy and\nconfidentiality (Schoeman 1984). Virtue ethics suggests its own set of\ngrounds for informational privacy in health care (van der Sloot 2017).\nJennifer Radden has argued that the special vulnerability of mental\nhealth patients and the stigma attached to their problems turns\nconfidentiality into a particular brand of excellence for mental\nhealth care practitioners (Radden 2004). She has argued that the\ndemand for confidentiality in psychiatric medicine is inadequately\naccounted for on theories that fail to take into account the virtues\nof trust and reserve that are hallmarks of mental health care. Ari\nEzra Waldman has also defended trust as a critical virtue for\nunderstanding the normative grounds of informational privacies.\n(Waldman 2018)\n\nIn the context of health research, ethics committees and institutional\nreview boards impose ethical obligations on researchers to protect the\nconfidentiality of research subjects and their medical information\n(Fisher 2006; Hiatt 2003; IOM 2000). The obligation of confidentiality\nmay require the use of \u201cidentifiers\u201d rather than names or\n\u201cde-identification\u201d procedures such as data aggregation\n(Presidential Commission 2012). Researchers may need to publish\ngenomic data in ways calculated to obscure the identities of whole\nfamilies. Patient confidentiality can be compromised in the setting of\nmedical lectures and ground rounds, and in the publication and\narchiving of medical lectures, scholarly articles and personal papers.\nThe question of whether there are privacy concerns when only\nstatistical use is made of individuals\u2019 health data has arisen.\nIt has been argued that individuals have an interest in the uses to\nwhich data sets that include their data is put, even if they are not\npersonally identified by researchers (Newcombe 1994).\n\nPrivacy theorists caution that deprivation of privacy can amount to\nsubordination, injustice and inhumanity (Skinner-Thompson 2020; Gandy\n1993). Most privacy theorists focus on the harms that stem from\ninvading the privacy people value. Theorists have begun also to\nconsider the harms that stem from voluntary self-disclosure (Allen\n2011). Individuals freely disclose medical and other sensitive\ninformation about themselves. They do it in published memoirs, in\nsocial media postings and in forums devoted to illnesses, medical\nprocedures, prescription medications, and alternative medicine. Women\nhave webcast childbirth and mastectomy, citing public health education\ngoals (Allen 2000).\n\nPrivacy is not defended as an absolute good (Hixson 1987; Boone 1983;\nLouch 1982; Pennock and Chapman 1971; Negley 1966). Confidentiality,\nfor example, is seldom described as an absolute good in health care\n(Bok 1982). Philosophers justifiably recommend major exceptions to the\npractice of confidentiality. First, all health care providers and\nresponsible adults should be obligated to report evidence of abuse or\nneglect of minor children, such as unexplained fractures and\nmalnutrition, even if the privacy interests of the children and/or\ntheir abusers would seem to suggest otherwise (Dickson 1998). Failure\nof medical workers to promptly disclose can have deadly consequences\nfor vulnerable minors. While confidentiality decisions are left to\nindividuals or their guardians in most instances, minor children are a\ndefensible exception due to their undeveloped cognitive and moral\ncapacities and due to the possibility that their guardians are abusers\nwho would benefit from confidentiality. Second, enshrined in American\nlaw as the Tarasoff Rule, mental health providers have an ethical duty\nto warn police or potential victims of mentally ill patients\u2019\nviolent imminent intentions (Gates and Arons 1999). These two\nexceptions reflect a belief that avoiding physical injury to third\nparties is more important than invariably deferring to patients\u2019\npreferences, sparing their feelings and preserving their trust in\nrelationships. Important philosophical questions arise about the\nextent of \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d duties, whistle-blowing\nobligations and the duty to warn in health care settings. Ascribing\nsuch duties potentially infringes the liberty persons otherwise enjoy\nto act and refrain from acting as they see fit so long as they do not\naffirmatively harm others. Arguably the person who declines to help or\nwarn is not the responsible cause of the abuse and violence that\nbefalls others. Yet beneficence argues for low risk, low cost\ninterventions to prevent serious harm.\n\nThird, there may be situations in which medical confidentiality should\nnot be protected because the public has a right to know. One category\nof information which the public or public health officials are\ncommonly thought to have a right to know is information about\ninstances of highly infectious contagious diseases with high rates of\nmortality and morbidity, such as ebola, COVID-19, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis\nand measles. Another category of information deemed not suitable for\nconfidentiality is information the media has a right to publish as a\nmatter of its newsworthiness. Dramatic medical rescues of automobile\naccident victims are understandably newsworthy events. It has been\nargued that the public has a right to know about public\nofficials\u2019 serious medical problems, perhaps more than\nauthorities have typically disclosed (Robins and Rothschild 1988;\nThompson 1987). In the United States, plaintiffs in personal injury\nlawsuits are asked to submit to medical examination; and lawyers and\ngrand juries have the authority to subpoena medical information for\nuse in legal proceedings and investigations, placing highly sensitive\nmedical information at risk of public disclosure (Wolf and Zandecki\n2006). Like the demands of public health surveillance, legal process\ndemands argue against unqualified rights of medical confidentiality\n(El Emam and Moher 2013).\n",
