    "main_text": "The Lockean Legacy || Animalism(s) vs. Neo-Lockeanism(s)\n2.3 Animalism(s) vs. Neo-Lockeanism(s)\n\nAnimalism\u2019s principal rival is not infrequently identified as\n\u201cneo-Lockeanism\u201d. This way of staging the debate dates\nback at least as far as a prominent exchange between Noonan (1998,\n2001) and D. Mackie (1999a). Also, the first monograph dedicated to\nanimalism mounts a sustained attack on the \u201cpsychological\napproach\u201d to personal identity\u2014an approach whose\n\u201cbest-known advocate \u2026 is, of course, Locke\u201d (Olson\n1997: 20). And the \u201canimalism vs. neo-Lockeanism\u201d\nopposition remains common in contemporary discussions (e.g., S.\nCampbell 2001; Hershenov 2012; Johnston 2010; Robinson 2016; S.\nShoemaker 2008).\n\nIn one respect, setting things up in this way is fairly harmless.\nViews classified as \u201cneo-Lockean\u201d share a common\ncommitment to a psychological criterion of personal identity (whether\nthat criterion requires direct psychological connectedness or merely\noverlapping chains of psychological continuity) that animalists\nuniversally oppose. But ultimately, the simple \u201canimalism vs.\nneo-Lockeanism\u201d dichotomy is too coarse-grained and exclusionary\nto provide a particularly informative taxonomy of the contemporary\ndebate. For example, whilst all animalists resist a psychological\ncriterion of persistence, the distinction between organic and somatic\nanimalisms\n (section 1.2)\n shows us that the source of this resistance varies significantly.\nAnd, as the list given above indicates\n (section 1.1),\n animalism\u2019s answer to the fundamental nature question is\nopposed by a wide range of views, not all of which are properly\nclassified as neo-Lockean. Moreover, as we shall see in what follows,\nthe \u201cneo-Lockeanism\u201d label both obscures importantly\ndifferent varieties of neo-Lockeanism and ignores different rationales\ngiven for those views.\n\nWhilst a comprehensive taxonomy of alternatives to animalism is\nneither feasible nor necessary in the present context, one step in the\nright direction would be to differentiate those neo-Lockean views that\nrely on the notion of material constitution from those that do not.\nThose that do\u2014call this type of view \u201cconstitutionalist\nneo-Lockeanism\u201d\u2014are today regarded as the leading\nopposition to animalism. Advocates of this form of neo-Lockeanism\n(including Baker, Johnston, and S. Shoemaker) contend that each of us\n\u201cis\u201d an animal only in the sense that (according to some)\na statue \u201cis\u201d the piece of marble, viz. by being\nmaterially colocated and yet distinguished by one or more modal,\ntemporal, and/or relational properties. On this view, we are persons\nnon-identically constituted by human animals.\n\nDespite this common reliance on the notion of material constitution,\nthere are significant differences between the views advocated by\nanimalism\u2019s constitutionalist neo-Lockean opponents. According\nto S. Shoemaker (1984), for instance, it is the capacity for thought\nthat distinguishes the mental subject you are from the human animal\nthat constitutes you. Partly because it is embedded within his\nbroader, functionalist response to the mind/body problem,\nShoemaker\u2019s arguments against animalism and animal thought are\ncomplex (see\n section 3.2\n for further discussion). But roughly, on his view, animals are\nincapable of thinking because they do not persist under the\nappropriate conditions. Psychological continuity is sufficient for the\npersistence of any being endowed with the capacity to think, and since\npsychological continuity is not sufficient for a (human) animal to\npersist, animals are not thinking beings. And because each of us is a\nthinking being, we are not animals. (For a thorough presentation of\nShoemaker\u2019s most recent thinking on this topic, see his 1999,\n2004, 2008, 2011, 2016.)\n\nPerhaps the most extensive elaboration of the constitutionalist\napproach has been given by Baker (2000, 2002, 2007). On her view, the\nproperty that distinguishes the persons we are from the human animals\nthat constitute us is a form of self-consciousness that she calls the\n\u201cfirst-person perspective\u201d (2000: ch. 3). It is from this\nperspective that \u201cone thinks of oneself as an individual facing\na world, as a subject distinct from everything else\u201d; it is what\nenables us \u201cto conceive of one\u2019s body and mental states as\none\u2019s own\u201d (2000: 60, 4). On her view, persons have their\nfirst-person perspectives essentially, and they \u201cpersist as long\nas [their] first-person perspectives are exemplified\u201d (2016: 51;\nsee also 2000: 132\u201341).\n\nAt the heart of this view is what Baker has recently labeled her\n\u201cKey Distinction\u201d (2007: 43; 2016: 53). Constitutionalists\nmaintain that constituting objects (e.g., pieces of marble) and\nconstituted objects (e.g., statues) can share some of their\nproperties. For instance, a statue shares its physical and aesthetic\nproperties with the piece of marble that constitutes it; likewise,\nBaker will claim, a person shares its physical and psychological\nproperties with the human animal that constitutes it. But these\nobjects cannot share all of their properties in the same way, or else\nthere would be no difference between the constituting and the\nconstituted. So Baker draws an exhaustive and mutually exclusive\ndistinction between two ways that objects can instantiate properties:\nderivatively or nonderivatively. Roughly, an object has a property\nderivatively if it instantiates it only in virtue of being colocated\nwith another object, whereas an object instantiates a property\nnonderivatively if it instantiates that property independently of\nbeing colocated with another object. We might express this distinction\nmore perspicuously as follows. If one object (x) constitutes\nanother object (y) and both objects instantiate some property\n(F), then\n\n x (the constituting object) instantiates F\nnonderivatively in the event it would instantiate F even if it\ndid not constitute y (the constituted object);\n y instantiates F nonderivatively in the event that\nx would fail to instantiate F if x did not\nconstitute y; and\n y instantiates F derivatively in the event that\nx would instantiate F even if it did not constitute\ny.\n\n\nConsider, for example, a marble statue of a giant ogre. In this case,\n(i) the piece of marble instantiates the property of being three\nmeters tall nonderivatively (because it would be three meters tall\neven if it did not constitute the statue); (ii) the statue\ninstantiates the property of being ugly nonderivatively (because the\npiece of marble with which it is colocated would not be ugly if it did\nnot constitute a statue); and (iii) the statue instantiates the\nproperty of being three meters tall derivatively (because the piece of\nmarble would be three meters tall even if it did not constitute the\nstatue). (Still more precise elaborations of Baker\u2019s Key\nDistinction are given in her 2000: 46\u201358 and 2007: 166\u201369.\nA number of critics have argued that the distinction generates more\nheat than light; see, e.g., Hershenov 2009; Olson 2007: ch. 3;\nZimmerman 2002; and contributions to the \nField Guide to the Philosophy of Mind \nonline symposium on Baker 2000.)\n\nBaker argues by analogy that, as it goes for marble statues, so it\ngoes for human persons. On her view, each of us is an animal, but\n(contra the animalist) only derivatively. Baker\u2019s\nanswer to the fundamental nature question is that we are persons; each\nof us possesses the first-person perspective essentially and\nnonderivatively. In the course of ordinary development, a human animal\ndevelops increasingly sophisticated psychological capacities (just\nlike the piece of marble develops aesthetic characteristics as the\nsculptor chisels away at it). Once these capacities include a\nfirst-person perspective, a person comes into existence, and this\nperson is constituted by the human animal (2000: 115\u201316; cf.\n2007: 72\u201382). Since the animal would not have a first-person\nperspective if it did not come to constitute the person, it shares\nthis perspective with the person in the same way that the piece of\nmarble shares the property of being ugly with the statue of the ogre,\nviz. derivatively.\n\nOn Baker\u2019s view, the first-person perspective is unique to\npersons. Without this perspective, she argues, a being cannot refer to\nitself using first-person pronouns, for this ability requires that one\nbe able to conceive of oneself both as the subject of mental events\nand as the object that embodies the subject of those events. Because\nthe human animal that constitutes you possesses a first-person\nperspective only derivatively, then, it is unable to self-refer. That\nsaid, Baker does not claim that person-constituting human animals lack\ncognitive and experiential capacities altogether. Nor does she claim\nthat they possess these capacities only derivatively. Like many of the\n\u201chigher\u201d nonhuman animals, human animals are subjects of\nan array of mental phenomena, including pains and pleasures, beliefs\nand desires. Such phenomena require not the \u201cstrong\u201d or\n\u201crobust\u201d first-person perspective characteristic of\npersons, but only what Baker calls a \u201cweak\u201d or\n\u201crudimentary\u201d first-person perspective\u2014roughly, the\ncapacity to experience the world from an egocentric point of view\n(2000: 60\u201364). And just as the statue inherits the property of\nbeing three meters tall from the piece of marble, so too the person\npossesses these lesser psychological capacities only derivatively\nbecause the human animal would possess these capacities even if it did\nnot constitute the person.\n\nNeo-Lockean resistance to animalism that is not linked to\nconstitutionalism is an even more diverse lot. One of the prevailing\nviews in the non-constitutionalist neo-Lockeanism category rejects\nanimalism by identifying the person with a proper part of the human\nanimal\u2014typically, the brain or one of its (spatial or temporal)\nparts. On this view, the human animal thinks only derivatively, in\nvirtue of having a thinking brain as a part. Among those who advocate\nviews along this line are Puccetti (1973), Persson (1999), McMahan\n(2002), Hudson (2001), and more recently Parfit (2012). Animalist\nresponses to these views are given by Hershenov (2005b, 2016) and\nOlson (2007: ch. 4). Also relevant are the various thought experiments\nraised by non-constitutionalist neo-Lockeans (e.g., Lewis 1976; Parfit\n1984) that seem to count against animalism; for instance, thought\nexperiments involving teletransportation and transplantation. See\n section 3.4\n for some discussion of these cases.\n",
