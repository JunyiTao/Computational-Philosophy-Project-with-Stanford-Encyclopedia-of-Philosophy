    "main_text": "Assault on Culture and Learning\n6. Assault on Culture and Learning\n\nIn the twentieth century, not a few scholars dubbed the fa\nthinkers \u201ctotalitarians\u201d (e.g., Creel 1953: 135\u2013158;\nRubin 1976: 55\u201388; Fu Zhengyuan 1996; for the criticism of this\ndesignation, see Schiele, forthcoming). Some of the aspects of the\nfa program\u2014a powerful state that overwhelms society,\nrigid control over the populace and the administrative apparatus,\nharsh laws, and the like\u2014seem to lend support to this equation.\nYet when we move to the realm of thought control\u2014a sine qua non\nfor a true totalitarian polity\u2014the results are somewhat\nequivocal. Although Shang Yang and Han Fei have much to say on matters\nof culture and learning, their message is predominantly negative: they\neagerly expose the fallacies of their opponents\u2019 views, but do\nnot necessarily provide an ideological alternative of their own.\n\nShang Yang is particularly notorious for his comprehensive assault on\ntraditional culture and on moral values. The Book of Lord\nShang abounds with controversial and highly provocative\nstatements like this one:\n\n\nPoems, Documents, rites, music, goodness,\nself-cultivation, benevolence, uprightness, argumentativeness,\ncleverness: when the state has these ten, superiors cannot induce [the\npeople] to [engage in] defense and fighting. If the state is ruled\naccording to these ten, then if the enemy arrives it will surely be\ndismembered, and if the enemy does not arrive, the state will surely\nbe impoverished. (Book of Lord Shang 3.5, \u201cAgriculture\nand warfare\u201d)\n\n\nThis and similar pronouncements, as well as the text\u2019s derisive\nlanguage (it often dubs moral values as \u201cparasites\u201d or\n\u201clice\u201d [shi \u8768]), explain why Shang Yang\ngained notoriety in the eyes of imperial literati, as well as many\nmodern scholars, as an enemy of morality. Yet this conclusion should\nbe qualified. The \u201calienating rhetoric,\u201d an example of\nwhich is cited above, is concentrated only in a few chapters of the\nBook of Lord Shang; most other display more accommodative\nviews toward traditional moral values; some even promise that\n\u201cthe sage ruler\u201d would be able to \u201cimplement\nbenevolence and righteousness in All under Heaven\u201d (Book of\nLord Shang 13.6, \u201cMaking orders strict\u201d; see also\nPines 2012). It seems that the text assaults not morality as such but\nrather moralizing discourse. It is this discourse\u2014or more\nprecisely its bearers, the peripatetic \u201cmen of service\u201d\nwho seek employment at the rulers\u2019 courts\u2014which arouse\nShang Yang\u2019s indignation.\n\nShang Yang deplores traveling intellectuals because they damage the\nfoundations of his sociopolitical model. By gaining official positions\nand emoluments outside the carefully designed system of ranks of\nmerit, they dilute the system\u2019s exclusivity. Shang Yang is less\nconcerned with the content of their doctrines; what matters to him is\nthat promotion of talkative intellectuals will cause the people engage\nin hollow talk and needless learning and \u201cbecome remiss in\nagriculture and warfare\u201d (Book of Lord Shang 3.5,\n\u201cAgriculture and warfare\u201d). Intellectuals, furthermore,\nare difficult to control, and their empty talks distract the ruler\nfrom commitment to war. Thus, learning is harmful both economically\nand politically.\n\nWhen the Book of Lord Shang speaks of \u201cteaching\u201d\nor \u201cindoctrination\u201d (jiao \u6559), it refers\nnot to imposition of a new set of values, but rather to the\ninternalization of the government\u2019s regulations. Once the people\nunderstand how the system works, they will comply with the\ngovernment\u2019s requirements without the need in coercion but\nrather because of pure self-interest. The text clarifies:\n\n\nWhat is called \u201cunification of teaching\u201d is that \u2026\nfathers and elder brothers, minor brothers, acquaintances, relatives\nby marriage, and colleagues all say: \u201cWhat we should be devoted\nto is just war and that is all.\u201d \u2026 The people\u2019s\ndesire for riches and nobility stops only when their coffin is sealed.\nAnd [entering] the gates of riches and nobility must be through\nmilitary [service]. Therefore, when they hear about war, the people\ncongratulate each other; whenever they move or rest, drink or eat,\nthey sing and chant only about war. (Book of Lord Shang 17.4,\n\u201cRewards and punishments\u201d)\n\n\nTeaching the people to \u201csing and chant only about war\u201d\ncould easily refer to military indoctrination, such as we encounter in\nother countries that employed mass armies. Yet the Book of Lord\nShang never resorts to adoration of martial spirit,\ndehumanization of the enemy, identifying martiality with masculinity,\nand similar devices employed in militaristic education elsewhere.\nRather, for Shang Yang and other contributors to \u201chis\u201d\nbook, \u201cteaching\u201d means simply the people\u2019s\ninternalization of the fact that the only way to satisfy their desires\nfor riches and glory is to excel in war. \u201cTeaching\u201d is not\nabout brainwashing; it is just about self-interested compliance with\nthe government\u2019s policies.\n\nHan Fei\u2019s views of traditional culture and of learning echo\nShang Yang\u2019s, but he is even more vehement in his dislike of\ntraveling scholars who rise up the sociopolitical ladder by selling\ntheir ideas to the rulers and to high ministers. Han Fei particularly\ndetests the moralizers\u2014followers of Confucius and Mozi\u2014who\nmislead the rulers with their arguments. He mercilessly exposes the\nmanipulativeness of their discourse, their self-serving definitions of\n\u201cworth\u201d and \u201cintelligence,\u201d their resort to\nhistorical examples which could be covertly subversive of political\npower. Yet the solution is not to devise an alternative discourse but\nrather to subjugate intellectual activity to the state\u2019s\ninterests:\n\n\nNow, when the ruler listens to [a certain] teaching, if he approves of\nits doctrine, he should promulgate it among the officials and employ\nits adherents; if he disapproves of its doctrine, he should dismiss\nits adherents and cut it off. (Han Feizi 50.4,\n\u201cIllustrious teachings\u201d)\n\n\nHan Fei does not deny in principle that some of the rival doctrines\nmay benefit the state; he just denies their proponents the right to\ndevelop and elaborate their views independently of the state. He\nleaves his rivals no illusions: the intellectuals can pursue their\nideas only within the state-ordained system of power, otherwise their\ndoctrines will be \u201ccut off.\u201d The text concludes:\n\n\nThus, in the state of a clear-sighted spvereign there are no texts\nwritten on bamboo strips, but the law is the teaching; there are no\n\u201cdiscourses\u201d of the former kings, but officials are the\nteachers; there is no private wielding of swords, but beheading\n[enemies] is valor. (Han Feizi 49.13, \u201cFive\nvermin\u201d)\n\n\nHan Fei\u2019s suggestion to eliminate the \u201ctexts written on\nbamboo strips\u201d and turn officials into teachers was implemented\nby his fellow student and nemesis, Li Si, soon after the imperial\nunification of 221 BCE. In 213 BCE, after heated court debates, Li Si\nlaunched a comprehensive assault on \u201cprivate learning,\u201d\nwhich he identified as intellectually divisive and politically\nsubversive. He then suggested eliminating copies of the canonical\nbooks of Poems and Documents, as well as\nDiscourses of the Hundred Schools (for which see Petersen\n1995) from private collections, leaving copies only in the possession\nof the court erudites (boshi \u535a\u58eb). Li Si\nconcluded his proposal by echoing Han Fei\u2019s views: \u201cAnd\nthose who want to study laws and ordinances, let them take an official\nas a teacher!\u201d (Shiji 87: 2546; Watson 1993: 185).\n\nLi Si\u2019s assault on private learning is often misinterpreted as\nthe victory of \u201cLegalist\u201d over \u201cConfucian\u201d\nideology, but this is wrong. Confucianism as such was not targeted;\nactually, it prospered among the court erudites (Kern 2000:\n188\u2013191). What mattered to Li Si\u2014as to Han Fei\u2014was\nnot doctrinal unity as such, but the imposition of the state control\nover intellectual life, like over other spheres of social activity.\nIntellectuals were not persecuted because of the content of their\nideas; but they were required either to enter government service or\nquit their pursuits. Yet Li Si\u2019s biblioclasm backfired. It\ncaused not only considerable resentment in the short term, but, more\nominously, brought about immense dislike of Qin\u2014and of the\nfa tradition in general\u2014among the overwhelming majority\nof the literati throughout the imperial period and beyond.\n",
