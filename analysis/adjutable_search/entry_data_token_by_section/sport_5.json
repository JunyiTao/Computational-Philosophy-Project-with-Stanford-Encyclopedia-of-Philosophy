According to Robert L. Simon, one\nof the pioneers of this view, \u2018broad internalism claims that in\naddition to the rules of various sports, there are underlying\nprinciples that might be embedded in overall theories or accounts of\nsport as a practice\u2019 (Simon, 2000, 7). Intrinsic principles are key for\nbroad internalists, as they provide the foundation for interpreting or\nunderstanding sport practices. Such principles are \u2018presuppositions of\nsporting practice in the sense that they must be accepted if our\nsporting practice is to make sense or, perhaps, make the best sense\u2019\n(Simon et al., 2015, 32). Formalists and conventionalists fail to give\ndue recognition to the idea that rules and conventions must be\ninterpreted and applied so as to respect and promote normative\nprinciples that determine the point of the practice.\n\n\nRonald Dworkin\u2019s interpretivist theory of law holds that law must be\ninterpreted in accordance with principles (e.g. justice) without which\nlegal practice would not make sense. Interpretivism heavily influenced\nSimon\u2019s formulation of broad internalism. This is perhaps unsurprising\nas several broad internalists consider sport to constitute a type of\nlegal system with its own jurisprudence (e.g. Russell. 2015). On\nSimon\u2019s view, sport is interpreted by appealing to intrinsic\nprinciples, separate to rules and conventions, that define the logic of\nthe practice. Justice and competitive excellence are examples of such\nprinciples. Without them, Simon\u2019s argument continues, the sporting\npractice would not make sense. Drawing on different understandings of\nthe intrinsic principles that underlie sport, three broad internalist\napproaches have been formulated: contractualism, the \u2018respect for\nthe integrity of the game\u2019 account, and mutualism.\n\n\nThe contractualist approach holds that sports are made possible by\nan implicit social contract among participants. Agreement to partake in\nthe practice and abide by a specific set of rules and conventions\nprovides normative validity to the rules and conventions upheld during\nthe game. For instance, Warren P. Fraleigh argues that sports are made\npossible not only by the rules, but also by the fact that players agree\nto follow them (Fraleigh, 1984). Inaugural events prior to sporting\nevents symbolize such an implicit pact. In the Olympic Games, for\nexample, countries parade with their respective national flags during\nthe opening ceremony and, as in the Ancient Olympic Games (Miller,\n2006), competitors swear an oath, agreeing to abide by the rules and\nthe spirit of fair play.\n\n\nThe \u2018respect for the integrity of the game\u2019 approach was\nproposed by Robert Butcher and Angela Schneider (Butcher and Schneider,\n1998). It focuses on identifying a game\u2019s interest, that is, the\ninterests of the game itself separate to the interest of players. These\ninterests, so the argument goes, must be respected by all involved. The\ngame is regarded as an intrinsically valuable entity which demands\nrespect. To flesh out the idea that a game itself may have interests,\nButcher and Schneider draw upon Kretchmar\u2019s theory of sport as a\ncontest aimed at comparing the participants\u2019 performances and Alasdair\nMacIntyre\u2019s notion of \u2018social practice.\u2019 Combining these\nviews, Butcher and Schneider argue that a game is an activity in which\nparticipants test each other both to discover who is superior in that\nsport and to achieve certain goods and excellences internal to the\npractice. These goods and excellences are connected to the distinctive\nnature of sport and the participants\u2019 experiences while engaged\nin them. For instance, the ability to kick a ball skillfully \u2013 to\nmake a beautiful pass \u2013 is an intrinsic good of soccer.\n\n\nThe foundation of the mutualist view is the understanding of\nsporting competition as a \u2018mutually acceptable quest for excellence\nthrough challenge\u2019 (Simon et al., 2015: 47). Robert L. Simon, Cesar R.\nTorres, and Peter F. Hager have provided the most detailed account of\nthis approach. They argue that mutualism is the philosophical theory\nthat best conceives sport.\n\n\nJohn S. Russell provides a similar account of sport, whereby\n\n\u2026 rules should be interpreted in such a manner that the excellences\nembodied in achieving the lusory goal of the game are not undermined\nbut are maintained and fostered. (Russell, 1999, 35)\n\n\nFor Russell, as for Simon, broad internalism \u2018generate[s] a coherent\nand principled account of the point and purposes that underlie the\ngame, attempting to show the game in its best light\u2019 (Russell, 1999,\n35).\n\n\nBy way of illustration, Russell (1999) recounts a baseball match\nfrom 1887 between Louisville and Brooklyn in which a Louisville player,\nReddy Mack, who had just crossed home plate interfered with a Brooklyn\ncatcher, preventing him from tagging another Louisville runner. While\nthe interference was ongoing, another Louisville player crossed home\nplate. Crucially, at the time of the game, the rules prohibited only\nbase runners from interfering with fielders. However, when Mack\ninterfered with the Brooklyn fielder, he was no longer a runner,\nbecause he had crossed the home plate. So, the rules did not explicitly\nprohibit Mack from interfering with the fielder. If the umpire followed\nthe rules strictly, then Mack\u2019s interference should have been\nallowed, and the runner who followed Mack to home plate should not have\nbeen ruled out. However, as Russell notes, following the rules in this\nway would have invited further interference of fielders by non-base\nrunners, so the game would likely have descended into a\n\u2018nine-inning-long wrestling match\u2019 (Russell, 1999: 28). To\nprevent such an outcome, the umpire read into existence a rule that\nprohibited non-base runners from interfering with fielders. So, he\ncalled out the runner who made it to home plate following Mack. This\nexercise of discretion was not subsequently overturned, and it\nprecipitated a rule change to prohibit non-base runners from\ninterfering with fielders. Indeed, it seemed necessary to depart from\nthe rules to protect the nature of the sport. The umpire might be\nunderstood to have considered the purpose of the sport in deciding how\nhe should rule on this incident. Baseball is a sport that tests\nexcellence in running, batting, throwing and catching \u2013 but not\nwrestling. The umpire interpreted (and amended) the rules in light of\nthe sport\u2019s underlying purpose. In short, the umpire had to\nappeal to principles that underlie the rules and conventions to decide\nhow the rules should be applied, and, in this case, to read a rule into\nexistence. In inventing a rule to govern this situation which the\nrulemakers had likely never countenanced, the umpire protected the\nintegrity of the game. For broad internalists, this example\ndemonstrates the necessity of appeal to principles that precede the\nrules and conventions. \n\n\nBroad internalist accounts closely connect sport to the pursuit of\nexcellence, as they typically view the fundamental purpose of sporting\ncompetition to be the display of sporting excellence. The connection\nbetween competition and excellence allows mutualist philosophers to\ndevelop a critical-pedagogical view of sport\u2019s competitive\nnature. This view challenges the strong emphasis placed on victory at\nthe elite level. For Simon, when victory is overemphasized, sports are\nseen as \u2018zero-sum\u2019 games (Simon, 2014), that is, games where only the\nvictor can benefit from participation. \n\n\nOn the mutualist view, sports are \u2018non-zero-sum\u2019 games. All players\ncan benefit from participation, even those who lose. Through\ncompetition, players push each other to perform and improve. While only\none player or team can win, all can benefit from competing, as\ncompetition can provide an avenue to more fully perfect one\u2019s\nabilities. When sport is at its best, competitors struggle\ncooperatively for excellence. On this view, the intrinsic principles of\nsport do not revolve around the pursuit of victory, but the cultivation\nof excellence. Drawing on MacIntyre, mutualist philosophers argue that\nthe goods more directly connected to victory are external to the\npractice, whereas those linked to excellence are internal (McFee,\n2004a). Mutualism is an Aristotelian-inspired teleological account of\nsport, whereby the purpose of sport is understood to be the promotion\nof human flourishing. This view of sport resonates with that of the\nOlympic Movement and its founder Pierre de Coubertin (Loland,\n1995).\n\n\nBroad internalism has been criticised on three principal grounds:\nfor failing to adequately acknowledge the importance of history to a\nproper normative account of sport; for its reliance on interpretive\nprinciples that are too vague to provide any practical guidance to\ndecisionmaking in sport (Morgan, 2016); and for delivering an\nincomplete account of sport (Kretchmar, 2015b; Nguyen, 2017). Drawing\non Thomas Nagel, Morgan argues that broad internalism provides a \u2018view\nfrom nowhere\u2019 notion of sport that fails to acknowledge the historical\nand social situatedness of sporting practices (Morgan, 2012). Kretchmar\ncontends that broad internalism provides a restrictive view of sport\nbuilt upon the value of work and excellence (Kretchmar, 2016). On this\nview, we should be pluralists, not monists, about the intrinsic value\nof sport. Excellence captures some of sport\u2019s intrinsic value,\nbut it is only a partial account. Paraphrasing Russell, mutualism shows\nsport in only one of its best lights. \n",
