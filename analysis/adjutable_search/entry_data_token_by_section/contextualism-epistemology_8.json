    "main_text": "Critical Reactions, Contextualist Responses || Some Initial Objections\n4.1 Some Initial Objections\nAmong objections to EC which have been made, some are more easily dealt with than others. For instance, Fred Dretske objects to the contextualist\u2019s response to skeptical problems as follows:\nSkepticism, as a doctrine about what ordinary people know, cannot be made true by being put in the mouth of a skeptic. Treating knowledge as an indexical\u2026[, however,] seems to have, or to come dangerously close to having, exactly this result. For this reason (among others) I reject it. (Dretske 1991, 192)\nTo this, however, the contextualist can reply that it is incorrect to say that EC, even where it allows the skeptic to successfully state some truth in uttering \u2018You don\u2019t know that p\u2018, thereby makes it easy for skepticism to be true. To suppose that it does requires denying the EC view that \u2018knowledge\u2019 sentences have context-sensitive contents\u2014hence that skeptic\u2019s denials are true at the expense of the truth of our ordinary claims to \u201cknow\u201d. (As we will see presently, there is another way of construing Dretske\u2019s objection, whereby it does not misfire in this way.)\nFor a second objection to EC that is not terribly effective, consider Palle Yourgrau\u2019s contention that EC licenses bizarre dialogues, such as the following:\n\nA: Is that a zebra?\nB: Yes, it is a zebra.\nA: But can you rule out its being merely a cleverly painted mule?\nB: No, I cannot.\nA: So, you admit you didn\u2019t know it was a zebra?\nB: No, I did know then that it was a zebra. But after your question, I no longer know. (1983, 183)\n\nAt least some versions of EC do not license such dialogues, however. According to them, the last reply by B is incorrect. Once the disguised zebra possibility is mentioned by A, B\u2019s \u201cknowing\u201d that it is a zebra requires B\u2019s being able to rule out that possibility and B cannot do that. According to these versions of EC, B would be speaking truly if B were then to admit that he did not \u201cknow\u201d it was a zebra (DeRose 2000).\nAccording to Keith DeRose (ibid., Section 6), what EC does license, in terms of legitimate ways for B to close out the dialogue, are only metalinguistic claims like:\nI was previously such that an utterance of \u2018B knows it is a zebra\u2019 would have expressed a true proposition, but the different and more demanding proposition which such an utterance would now express would not be true.\nNikola Kompa (2002, 5) has observed that EC would also seemingly permit B to say,\nHad I uttered \u2018I know it is a zebra\u2019 earlier, I would thereby have expressed a truth, but I do not know that it is a zebra.\nKompa calls this \u201can unpleasant consequence\u201d of EC. And one might similarly regard claims in which there is explicit relativization of \u2018know\u2019 to the relevant standards, as in,\nI knowS1 that it is a zebra, but I don\u2019t knowS2 that it is a zebra.\nAs Kent Bach (2005, 58\u201361) says, there is nothing in EC that precludes the legitimacy of such claims. After all, they merely involve making explicit what are, according to EC, the propositions expressed by the relevant utterances. But the contextualist may reply that any unpleasantness or feeling of unfamiliarity attending such claims stems from our failing to be fully aware of the context-sensitivity of the expressions in question. (Compare how Cohen (2001, 89) responds to a certain objection of Feldman\u2019s (2001, 77).) Whether this sort of error theory is problematic is a separate issue, discussed below.\nThat EC concerns \u2018knowledge\u2019, rather than knowledge, might help to defuse other concerns about EC. As noted above, Lewis says dramatic and apparently troubling things when discussing his contextualist theory. For example, he says that once certain skeptical possibilities are raised \u201c[knowledge] vanishes\u201d (1996, 560). But his theory implies this only because Lewis is using the word \u2018knowledge\u2019 in a context where skeptical possibilities are not properly ignored and not excluded by his evidence. A contextualist can contend that this is less troubling than it might seem. Lewis\u2019s theory does not imply that this vanishing extends to ordinary claims to \u201cknowledge\u201d outside of skepticial contexts. They remain true. Because it suggests otherwise, Lewis\u2019s speaking of knowledge \u201cvanishing\u201d, as opposed to the falsity of certain propositions expressed by \u2018knowledge\u2019 sentences, is misleading (see Bach 2005, 54\u201355, and DeRose 2000).\n",
