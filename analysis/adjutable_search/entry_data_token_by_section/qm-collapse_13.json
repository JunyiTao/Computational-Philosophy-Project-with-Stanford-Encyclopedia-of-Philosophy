    "main_text": "The Status of Collapse Models and Recent Positions about them\n14. Summary\n\nWe presented a comprehensive picture of the ideas, the implications,\nthe achievements and the problems of the DRP. We conclude by stressing\nonce more our position with respect to Collapse Theories. Their\ninterest derives entirely from the fact that they have given some\nhints about a possible way out from the difficulties characterizing\nstandard quantum mechanics, by proving that explicit and precise\nmodels can be worked out, which agree with all known predictions of\nthe theory and nevertheless allow, on the basis of a universal\ndynamics governing all natural processes, to overcome in a\nmathematically clean and precise way the basic problems of the\nstandard theory. In particular, Collapse Models show how one can work\nout a theory that makes perfectly legitimate to take a macrorealistic\nposition about natural processes, without contradicting any of the\nexperimentally tested predictions of standard quantum mechanics.\nFinally, they might give precise hints about where to look in order to\nput into evidence, experimentally, possible violations of the\nsuperposition principle.\n",
