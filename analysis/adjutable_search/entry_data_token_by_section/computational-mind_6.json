    "main_text": "Neural networks || Relation between neural networks and classical computation\n4.1 Relation between neural networks and classical computation\nNeural networks have a very different \u201cfeel\u201d than\nclassical (i.e., Turing-style) models. Yet classical computation and\nneural network computation are not mutually exclusive:\n\n One can implement a neural network in a classical\nmodel. Indeed, every neural network ever physically constructed\nhas been implemented on a digital computer.\n One can implement a classical model in a neural\nnetwork. Modern digital computers implement Turing-style\ncomputation in networks of logic gates.  Alternatively, one can\nimplement Turing-style computation using an analog recurrent neural\nnetwork whose nodes take continuous activation values (Graves, Wayne,\nand Danihelka 2014, Other Internet Resources; Siegelmann and Sontag\n1991; Siegelmann and Sontag 1995).\n\nAlthough some researchers suggest a fundamental opposition between\nclassical computation and neural network computation, it seems more\naccurate to identify two modeling traditions that overlap in certain\ncases but not others (cf. Boden 1991; Piccinini 2008b). In this\nconnection, it is also worth noting that classical computationalism\nand connectionist computationalism have their common origin in the\nwork of McCulloch and Pitts.\nPhilosophers often say that classical computation involves\n\u201crule-governed symbol manipulation\u201d while neural network\ncomputation is non-symbolic. The intuitive picture is that\n\u201cinformation\u201d in neural networks is globally distributed\nacross the weights and activations, rather than concentrated in\nlocalized symbols. However, the notion of \u201csymbol\u201d itself\nrequires explication, so it is often unclear what theorists mean by\ndescribing computation as symbolic versus non-symbolic. As mentioned\nin \u00a71, the Turing formalism places very few\nconditions on \u201csymbols\u201d. Regarding primitive symbols,\nTuring assumes just that there are finitely many of them and that they\ncan be inscribed in read/write memory locations. Neural networks can\nalso manipulate symbols satisfying these two conditions: as just\nnoted, one can implement a Turing-style model in a neural network.\nMany discussions of the symbolic/non-symbolic dichotomy employ a\nmore robust notion of \u201csymbol\u201d. On the more robust\napproach, a symbol is the sort of thing that represents a subject\nmatter. Thus, something is a symbol only if it has semantic or\nrepresentational properties. If we employ this more robust notion of\nsymbol, then the symbolic/non-symbolic distinction cross-cuts the\ndistinction between Turing-style computation and neural network\ncomputation. A Turing machine need not employ symbols in the more\nrobust sense. As far as the Turing formalism goes, symbols manipulated\nduring Turing computation need not have representational properties\n(Chalmers 2011). Conversely, a neural network can manipulate symbols\nwith representational properties. Indeed, an analog neural network can\nmanipulate symbols that have a combinatorial syntax and semantics\n(Horgan and Tienson 1996; Marcus 2001).\nFollowing Steven Pinker and Alan Prince (1988), we may distinguish\nbetween eliminative connectionism and implementationist\nconnectionism.\nEliminative connectionists advance connectionism as a rival to\nclassical computationalism. They argue that the Turing formalism is\nirrelevant to psychological explanation. Often, though not always,\nthey seek to revive the associationist tradition in\npsychology, a tradition that CCTM had forcefully challenged. Often,\nthough not always, they attack the mentalist, nativist linguistics\npioneered by Noam Chomsky (1965). Often, though not always, they\nmanifest overt hostility to the very notion of mental\nrepresentation. But the defining feature of eliminative connectionism\nis that it uses neural networks as replacements for\nTuring-style models. Eliminative connectionists view the mind as a\ncomputing system of a radically different kind than the Turing\nmachine. A few authors explicitly espouse eliminative connectionism\n(Churchland 1989; Rumelhart and McClelland\n1986; Horgan and Tienson\n1996), and many others incline towards it.\nImplementationist connectionism is a more ecumenical position. It\nallows a potentially valuable role for both Turing-style\nmodels and neural networks, operating harmoniously at\ndifferent levels of description (Marcus 2001; Smolensky 1988). A\nTuring-style model is higher-level, whereas a neural network model is\nlower-level.  The neural network illuminates how the brain implements\nthe Turing-style model, just as a description in terms of logic gates\nilluminates how a personal computer executes a program in a high-level\nprogramming language.\n",
