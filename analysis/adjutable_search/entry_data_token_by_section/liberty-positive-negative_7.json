    "main_text": "The Concept of Overall Freedom\n6. The Concept of Overall Freedom\n\nThe concept of overall freedom appears to play an important role both\nin everyday discourse and in contemporary political philosophy. It is\nonly recently, however, that philosophers have stopped concentrating\nexclusively on the meaning of a particular freedom \u2014 the freedom\nto do or become this or that particular thing \u2014 and have started\nasking whether we can also make sense of descriptive claims to the\neffect that one person or society is freer than another, or of liberal\nnormative claims to the effect that freedom should be maximized or\nthat people should enjoy equal freedom or that they each have a right\nto a certain minimum level of freedom. The literal meaningfulness of\nsuch claims depends on the possibility of gauging degrees of overall\nfreedom, sometimes comparatively, sometimes absolutely.\n\nTheorists disagree, however, about the importance of the notion of\noverall freedom. For some libertarian and liberal egalitarian\ntheorists, freedom is valuable as such. This suggests that more\nfreedom is better than less (at least ceteris paribus), and\nthat freedom is one of those goods that a liberal society ought to\ndistribute in a certain way among individuals. For other liberal\ntheorists, like Ronald Dworkin (1977, 2011) and the later Rawls\n(1991), freedom is not valuable as such, and all claims about maximal\nor equal freedom ought to be interpreted not as literal references to\na scalar good called \u2018liberty\u2019 but as elliptical\nreferences to the adequacy of lists of certain particular liberties,\nor types of liberties, selected on the basis of values other than\nliberty itself. Generally speaking, only the first group of theorists\nfinds the notion of overall freedom interesting.\n\nThe theoretical problems involved in measuring overall freedom include\nthat of how an agent\u2019s available actions are to be individuated,\ncounted and weighted, and that of comparing and weighting different\ntypes (but not necessarily different sources) of constraints on\nfreedom (such as physical prevention, punishability, threats and\nmanipulation). How are we to make sense of the claim that the number\nof options available to a person has increased? Should all options\ncount for the same in terms of degrees of freedom, or should they be\nweighted according to their importance in terms of other values? If\nthe latter, does the notion of overall freedom really add anything of\nsubstance to the idea that people should be granted those specific\nfreedoms that are valuable? Should the degree of variety among options\nalso count? And how are we to compare the unfreedom created by the\nphysical impossibility of an action with, say, the unfreedom created\nby the difficulty or costliness or punishability of an action? It is\nonly by comparing these different kinds of actions and constraints\nthat we shall be in a position to compare individuals\u2019 overall\ndegrees of freedom. These problems have been addressed, with differing\ndegrees of optimism, not only by political philosophers (Steiner 1983;\nCarter 1999; Kramer 2003; Garnett 2016; C\u00f4t\u00e9 2020; Carter\nand Steiner 2021) but also by social choice theorists interested in\nfinding a freedom-based alternative to the standard utilitarian or\n\u2018welfarist\u2019 framework that has tended to dominate their\ndiscipline (e.g. Pattanaik and Xu 1991, 1998; Hees 2000; Sen 2002;\nSugden 1998, 2003, 2006; Bavetta 2004; Bavetta and Navarra 2012,\n2014).\n\nMacCallum\u2019s framework is particularly well suited to the\nclarification of such issues. For this reason, theorists working on\nthe measurement of freedom tend not to refer a great deal to the\ndistinction between positive and negative freedom. This said, most of\nthem are concerned with freedom understood as the availability of\noptions. And the notion of freedom as the availability of options is\nunequivocally negative in Berlin\u2019s sense at least where two\nconditions are met: first, the source of unfreedom is limited to the\nactions of other agents, so that natural or self-inflicted obstacles\nare not seen as decreasing an agent\u2019s freedom; second, the\nactions one is free or unfree to perform are weighted in some\nvalue-neutral way, so that one is not seen as freer simply because the\noptions available to one are more valuable or conducive to one\u2019s\nself-realization. Of the above-mentioned authors, only Steiner\nembraces both conditions explicitly. Sen rejects both of them, despite\nnot endorsing anything like positive freedom in Berlin\u2019s\nsense.\n",
