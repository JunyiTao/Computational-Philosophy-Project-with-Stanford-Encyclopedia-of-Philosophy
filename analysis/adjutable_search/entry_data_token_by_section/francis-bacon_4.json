In\nDe Principiis atque Originibus, his materialistic stance with\nregard to his conception of natural law becomes evident. The\nSummary Law of Nature is a virtus\n(matter-cum-motion) or power in accordance with matter theory, or\n\nthe force implanted by God in these first particles, form the\nmultiplication thereof of all the variety of things proceeds and is\nmade up. (Bacon V [1889], 463)\n\nSimilarly, in De Sapientia Veterum he attributes to this\nforce an \n appetite or instinct of primal matter; or to speak\nmore plainly, the natural motion of the atom; which is indeed the\noriginal and unique force that constitutes and fashions all things out\nof matter. (Bacon VI [1890], 729)\n\nSuffice it to say here that Bacon, who did not reject mathematics in\nscience, was influenced by the early mathematical version of chemistry\ndeveloped in the 16th century, so that the term\n\u2018instinct\u2019 must be seen as a keyword for his theory of\nnature. The natural philosopher is urged to inquire into the\n appetites and inclination of things by which all that\nvariety of effects and changes which we see in the works of nature and\nart is brought about. (Bacon III [1887], 17\u201322; V [1889],\n422\u20136 and 510ff.: Descriptio Globi Intellectualis; cf.\nIV [1901], 349)\n\nBacon's theory of active or even vivid force in matter accounts for\nwhat he calls Cupid in De Principiis atque Originibus (Bacon\nV [1889], 463\u20135). Since his theory of matter aims at an\nexplanation of the reality which is the substratum of appearances, he\ndigs deeper than did the mechanistic physics of the 17th\ncentury (Gaukroger 2001, 132\u20137). Bacon's ideas concerning\nthe quid facti of reality presuppose the distinction \n between understanding how things are made up and of\nwhat they consist, \u2026 and by what force and in what manner they\ncome together, and how they are transformed. (Gaukroger 2001,\n137)\n\n\nThis is the point in his work where it becomes obvious that he tries\nto develop an explanatory pattern in which his theory of matter, and\nthus his atomism, are related to his cosmology, magic, and\nalchemy.\n\nIn De Augmentis, Bacon not only refers to Pan and his\nnymphs in order to illustrate the permanent atomic movement in matter\nbut in addition revives the idea of magic in a \n\u2018honourable meaning\u2019 as \n\nthe knowledge of the universal consents of\nthings \u2026. I \u2026 understand [magic] as the science which\napplies the knowledge of hidden forms to the production of wonderful\noperations; and by uniting (as they say) actives with passives,\ndisplays the wonderful works of nature. (Bacon IV [1901],\n366\u20137: De Augmentis III.5)\n\n\nBacon's notion of form is made possible by integration into\nhis matter theory, which (ideally) reduces the world of appearances to\nsome minimal parts accessible and open to manipulation by the\nknower/maker. In contrast to Aristotle, Bacon's knowing-why type\nof definition points towards the formulation of an efficient\nknowing-how type (P\u00e9rez-Ramos 1988, 119). In this sense a\nconvergence between the scope of definition and that of causation takes\nplace according to a \u2018constructivist epistemology\u2019. The\nfundamental research of Graham Rees has shown that Bacon's\nspecial mode of cosmology is deeply influenced by magic and\nsemi-Paracelsian doctrine. For Bacon, matter theory is the basic\ndoctrine, not classical mechanics as it is with Galileo. Consequently,\nBacon's purified and modified versions of chemistry, alchemy, and\nphysiology remain primary disciplines for his explanation of the\nworld.\n\n\nAccording to Rees, the Instauratio Magna comprises two\nbranches: (1) Bacon's famous scientific method, and (2) his\nsemi-Paracelsian world system as \u201ca vast, comprehensive system\nof speculative physics\u201d (Rees 1986, 418). For (2) Bacon conjoins\nhis specific version of Paracelsian cosmic chemistry to Islamic\ncelestial kinematics (especially in Alpetragius [al-Bitruji]; see Zinner 1988, 71). The chemical\nworld system is used to support Bacon's explanation of celestial\nmotion in the face of contemporary astronomical problems (Rees 1975b,\n161f.). There are thus two sections in Bacon's Instauratio,\nwhich imply the modes of their own explanation.\n\n\nBacon's speculative cosmology and matter theory had been\nplanned to constitute Part 5 of Instauratio Magna. The theory\nput forward refers in an eclectic vein to atomism, criticizes\nAristotelians and Copernicans, but also touches on Galileo, Paracelsus,\nWilliam Gilbert, Telesio, and Arabic astronomy.\n\n\nFor Bacon, \u2018magic\u2019 is classified as applied science,\nwhile he generally subsumes under \u2018science\u2019 pure science\nand technology. It is never identified with black magic, since it\nrepresents the \u201cultimate legitimate power over nature\u201d\n(Rees 2000, 66). Whereas magia was connected to crafts in the\n16th and 17th centuries, Bacon's science\nremains the knowledge of forms in order to transform them into\noperations. Knowledge in this context, however, is no longer\nexclusively based on formal proof.\n\n\nBacon's cosmological system\u2014a result of thought\nexperiments and speculation, but not proven in accordance with the\ninductive method\u2014presupposes a finite universe, a geocentric\nplenum, which means that the earth is passive and consists of\ntangible matter. The remaining universe is composed of active\nor pneumatic matter. Whereas the interior and tangible matter\nof the earth is covered by a crust which separates it from the\npneumatic heaven, the zone between earth and the \u201cmiddle region\nof the air\u201d allows a mixture of pneumatic and tangible matter,\nwhich is the origin of organic and non-organic phenomena. Bacon speaks\nhere of \u201cattached spirit\u201d (Rees 1986, 418\u201320), while\notherwise he assumes four kinds of free spirit: air and terrestrial\nfire, which refer to the sublunary realm; ether and sidereal fire,\nwhich are relevant to the celestial realm. Ether is explained as the\nmedium in which planets move around the central earth. Air and ether,\nas well as watery non-inflammable bodies, belong to Bacon's first\ngroup of substances or to the Mercury Quaternion.\n\n\nTerrestrial fire is presented as the weak variant of sidereal fire;\nit joins with oily substances and sulphur, for all of which Bacon\nintroduces the Sulphur Quaternion. These quaternions comprise\nantithetical qualities: air and ether versus fire and sidereal fire.\nThe struggle between these qualities is determined by the distance from\nthe earth as the absolute center of the world system. Air and ether\nbecome progressively weaker as the terrestrial and sidereal fire grow\nstronger. The quaternion theory functions in Bacon's thought as a\nconstructive element for constituting his own theory of planetary\nmovement and a general theory of physics. This theory differs from all\nother contemporary approaches, even though Bacon states that\n\u201cmany theories of the heavens may be supposed which agree well\nenough with the phenomena and yet differ with each other\u201d (Bacon\nIV [1901], 104). The diurnal motion of the world system (9th\nsphere) is driven by sympathy; it carries the heavens westward around\nthe earth. The sidereal fire is powerful and, accordingly, sidereal\nmotion is swift (the stars complete their revolution in 24 hours).\nSince the sidereal fire becomes weaker if it burns nearer to the earth,\nthe lower planets move more slowly and unevenly than the higher ones\n(in this way Bacon, like Alpetragius, accounts for irregular planetary\nmovement without reference to Ptolemy's epicycle theory). He\napplies his theory of consensual motion to physics generally (e.g.,\nwind and tides) and thus comes into conflict with Gilbert's\ndoctrine of the interstellar vacuum and Galileo's theory of the\ntides (for Bacon, the cycle of tides depends on the diurnal motion of\nthe heavens but, for Galileo, on the earth's motion).\n\n\nWith quaternion theory we see that, in the final analysis, Bacon was\nnot a mechanist philosopher. His theory of matter underwent an\nimportant transformation, moving in the direction of\n\u2018forms\u2019, which we would nowadays subsume under biology or\nthe life sciences rather than under physics. Bacon distinguishes\nbetween non-spiritual matter and spiritual matter. The latter, also\ncalled \u2018subtle matter\u2019 or \u2018spirit\u2019, is more\nreminiscent of Leibniz' \u2018monads\u2019 than of mechanically\ndefined and materially, as well as spatially, determined atoms. The\nspirits are seen as active agents of phenomena; they are endowed with\n\u2018appetition\u2019 and \u2018perception\u2019 (Bacon I [1889],\n320\u201321: Historia Vitae et Mortis; see also V, 63:\nSylva Sylvarum, Century IX:\n\u201cIt is certain that\nall bodies whatsoever, though they have no sense, yet they have\nperception: for when one body is applied to another, there is a kind of\nelection to embrace that which is agreeable, and to exclude or expel\nthat which is ingrate\u201d).\n\n\nThese spirits are never at rest. In the Novum Organum,\nthen, Bacon  rejected the \u201cexistence of eternal and\nimmutable atoms and the reality of the void\u201d (Kargon 1966, 47).\nHis new conception of matter was therefore \u201cclose to that of the\nchemists\u201d in the sense of Bacon's semi-Paracelsian\ncosmology (Rees 2000, 65\u201369). The careful natural philosopher\ntries to disclose the secrets of nature step by step; and therefore\n he says of his method:  \u201cI propose to establish\nprogressive stages of certainty\u201d (Bacon IV [1901], 40: Novum\nOrganum, Preface). This points towards his inductive procedure and\nhis method of tables, which is a complicated mode of induction by\nexclusion. It is necessary because nature hides her secrets. In\nAphorism XIX of Book I in his Novum Organum Bacon writes:\n\nThere are and can be only two ways of searching into and\ndiscovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars to the\nmost general axioms, and from these principles, the truth of which it\ntakes for settled and immoveable, proceeds to judgment and to the\ndiscovery of middle axioms. And this way is now in fashion. The other\nderives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by gradual and\nunbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of\nall. This is the true way, but as yet untried. (Bacon IV [1901],\n50)\n\n\nThe laws of nature, which Bacon intended to discover by means of his\nnew method, were expressed in the  \u2018forms\u2019, in which\nthe \u2018unbroken ascent\u2019 culminates. Through these forms the\nnatural philosopher understands the general causes of phenomena\n(Kargon 1966, 48). In his endeavor to learn more about the secret\nworkings of nature, Bacon came to the conclusion that the atomist\ntheory could not provide sufficient explanations for the \u201creal\nparticles, such as really exist\u201d (Bacon IV [1901], 126:\nNovum Organum, II.viii), because he thought that the\nimmutability of matter and the void (both necessary assumptions for\natomism) were untenable. His language turned from that of Greek physics\nto the usage of contemporary chemists. This is due to his insight that\n\u201csubtlety of investigation\u201d is needed, since our senses are\ntoo gross for the complexity and fineness of nature, so that method has\nto compensate for the shortcomings of our direct comprehension. Only\nmethod leads to the knowledge of nature: in Sylva Sylvarum,\nCentury I.98  Bacon deals explicitly with the question of the\nasymmetrical relationship between man's natural instrument (i.e.,\nthe senses) and the intricacy of nature's structures and\nworkings.\n\n\nBacon distinguishes \u2018animate\u2019 or vital spirits, which\nare continuous and composed of a substance similar to fire, from\nlifeless or inanimate spirits, which are cut off and resemble air: the\nspirits interact with gross matter through chemical processes (Bacon\nIV, 195\u20136 (Novum Organum, II.xl)). These spirits\nhave two different desires: self-multiplication and attraction of like\nspirits. According to Kargon (1966, 51):\n\n Bacon's later\ntheory of matter is one of the interaction of gross, visible parts of\nmatter and invisible material spirits, both of which are physically\nmixed.\n\nSpirits interact with matter by means of concoction, colliquation and\nother non-mechanical chemical processes, so that Bacon's scientific\nparadigm differs from Descartes' mechanist theory of matter in\nhis Principia Philosophiae (1644), which presupposes res\nextensa moving in space.  Bacon's theory of matter is thus\nclosely related to his speculative philosophy:\n\n The distinction between tangible and\npneumatic matter is the hinge on which the entire speculative system\nturns. (Rees 1996, 125; Paracelsus had already stated that\nknowledge inheres in the object: see Shell 2004,  32)\n\n\nBacon's theory of matter in its final version was more\ncorpuscular than atomist (Clericuzio 2000, 78). Bacon's\nparticles are semina rerum:  they are endowed  with\npowers,  which make a variety of motions possible and allow the\nproduction of all possible forms. These spirits are constitutive for\nBacon's  theory of matter. As material, fine substances,\ncomposed of particles, combined from air and fire, they can, as we have\nseen, be either inanimate or animate. Bacon thus suggests a corpuscular\nand chemical chain of being:\n\n\ninanimate objects\n\u2192\ninaugurate spirits\n\n\nvegetables\n\u2192\ninanimate + vital spirits\n\n\nanimals\n\u2192\nvital spirits\n\n\n\n\nSmall wonder, then, that Bacon's spirits are indispensable for\nhis conception of physiology: \n the vital spirits regulate all vegetative functions of\nplants and animals. Organs responsible for these functions, for\ndigestion, assimilation, etc., seem to act by perception, mere\nreaction to local stimuli, but these reactions are coordinated by the\nvital spirit. These functions flow from the spirit's airy-flamy\nconstitution. The spirit has the softness of air to receive\nimpressions and the vigour of fire to propagate its actions. (Rees in\nOFB VI, 202\u20133) \n\nThis physiological stratum of Bacon's natural philosophy was\ninfluenced by his semi-Paracelsian cosmology (on Paracelsus see\nM\u00fcller-Jahncke 1985, 67\u201388), which Graham Rees (Rees and\nUpton 1984, 20\u20131) has reconstructed from the extant parts of the\nInstauratio Magna. Detailed consideration therefore has to be\ngiven to Bacon's theory of the \u2018quaternions\u2019.\n\n\nBacon's speculative system is a hybrid based on different sources\nwhich provided him with seminal ideas: e.g., atomism, Aristotelianism,\nArabic astronomy, Copernican theory, Galileo's discoveries, the works\nof Paracelsus, and Gilbert. In his theory he combines astronomy,\nreferring to Alpetragius (see Dijksterhuis 1956, 237\u201343; Rees\nand Upton 1984, 26; Gaukroger, 2001, 172\u20135; and see Grant\n1994, 533\u201366, for discussion of the cosmology of Alpetragius),\nand chemistry (Rees 1975a, 84\u20135): \n[i]t was partly designed to fit a kinematic skeleton\nand explain, in general terms, the irregularities of planetary motion\nas consequences of the chemical constitution of the universe. (Rees\n1975b, 94) \n\nBacon had no explanation for the planetary retrogressions and saw the\nuniverse as a finite and geocentric plenum, in which the earth\nconsists of the two forms of matter (tangible and pneumatic). The\nearth has a tangible inside and is in touch with the surrounding\nuniverse, but through an intermediate zone. This zone exists between\nthe earth's crust and the pure pneumatic heavens; it reaches some\nmiles into the crust and some miles into air. In this zone, pneumatic\nmatter mixes with tangible matter, thus producing \u2018attached\nspirits\u2019, which must be distinguished from \u2018free\nspirits\u2019 outside tangible bodies.  Bacon's four kinds of free\nspirits are relevant for his \u2018quaternion theory\u2019:\n\n\n\u2013 air\n\n\u2013 ether\n\n\n\n\nsublunary\n\ncelestial\n\n\n\u2013 terrestrial fire\n\n\u2013 sidereal fire\n\n\n\n\nThe planets move around the earth in the ether (a tenuous kind of\nair), which belongs to the \u2018mercury quaternion\u2019: it\nincludes watery bodies and mercury. Terrestrial fire is a weakened\nform of sidereal fire. It is related to oily substances and sulphur,\nand constitutes the \u2018sulphur quaternion\u2019. The two\nquaternions oppose each other: air/ether vs. fire/sidereal fire. Air\nand ether loose power when terrestrial and sidereal fires grow more\nenergetic\u2014Bacon's sulphur and mercury are not principles in the\nsense of Paracelsus, but simply natural substances. The Paracelsian\nprinciple of salt is excluded by Bacon and the substance, which plays\na role only in the sublunary realm, is for him a compound of natural\nsulphur and mercury (Rees and Upton 1984, 25).\n\n\n           \nBacon used his quaternion theory for his cosmology, which differs\ngreatly from other contemporary systems (Rees 2000, 68):\n\nthe diurnal motion turns\nthe heavens about the earth towards the west;\nunder powerful sidereal\nfire (i.e., principle of celestial motion) the motion is swift: the\nrevolution of the stars takes place in twenty-four hours;\nunder weaker sidereal\nfire\u2014nearer to the earth\u2014planets move more slowly and\nmore erratic.\n\n\n\nBacon, who tried to conceive of a unified physics, rejected\ndifferent modes of motion in the superlunary and in the sublunary world\n(Bacon I [1889], 329). He did not believe in the existence of\nthe (crystalline) spheres nor in the macrocosm-microcosm analogy. He\nrevised Paracelsian ideas thoroughly. He rejected the grounding of his\ntheories in Scripture and paid no attention at all to Cabbalistic and\nHermetic tendencies (Rees 1975b, 90\u20131). But he extended the\nexplanatory powers of the quaternions to earthly phenomena such as wind\nand tides.\n\nBacon's two systems were closely connected:\n\nSystem 1: (The Two Quaternions) explained and comprised the\ncosmological aspect of his natural philosophy.\nSystem 2: (Theory of Matter) explained terrestrial nature, that is,\nit \u201cdealt with the manifold changes in the                 \nanimal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms of the frontier zone between\nthe celestial heavens and the Earth's interior\u201d (Rees\n1996, 130; the two tables are taken from Rees). \n\n\n\nSystem 2 depends on System 1, since explanations for terrestrial\nthings were subordinated to explanations of the cosmological level. The\ntable of System 2 shows Bacon's matter theory. His quaternion\ntheory is relevant for System 1. System 2 is explained in terms of\n\u2018intermediates\u2019, which combine the qualities of the items\nin one quaternion with their opposites in the other.\n\n\nBacon's system is built in a clear symmetrical way: each\nquaternion has four segments, together eight and there are four types\nof intermediates. Thus, the system distinguishes twelve segments in\nall. He wanted to explain all natural phenomena by means of this\napparatus:\n\n\nThe Two Quaternions\n\n\n Sulphur Quaternion \nMercury Quaternion\n\n\n\nTangible\nSubstances \n(With Attached Spirits) \n\nSulphur (subterranean) \nMercury (subterranean)\n\n\nOil and oily\ninflammable \nsubstances\n(terrestrial) \n\nWater and \u2018crude\u2019\nnon-inflammable\nsubstances (terrestrial)\n\n\n\n\nPneumatic Substances\n \n\nTerrestrial fire\n(sublunary) \n Air\n(sublunary)\n\n\nSidereal fire\n(planets) \nEther (medium of the planets) \n\n\n\nThe Theory of Matter\nSulphur QuaternionIntermediatesMercury Quaternion\n\nTangible Substances (with attached spirits)\nSulphur (subterranean) Salts (subterranean and in organic beings)\nMercury (subterranean)\n\n\nOil and oily inflammable substances  (terrestrial) \nJuices of animals and plants \nWater and \u2018crude\u2019 non-inflammable substances (terrestrial)\n\n\nPneumatic substances\n Terrestrial fire (sublunary) \n Attached animate and inanimate spirits (in tangible bodies)\n Air (sublunary)\n\n\nSidereal fire (planets) \n Heaven of the fixed stars \nEther (medium of planets)\n\n\n\n\nThere are two principal intermediates:\n\n\n \nThe fire-air intermediates\n\n\u2193\u2193\n\n\n\u2018attached\u2019 animate spirits\ninanimate spirits\n\n\n\u2193\u2193\n\n\n only in living bodies\n in all tangible bodies (including living bodies)\n\n\n\n\nBacon's bi-quaternion theory necessarily refers to the\nsublunary as well as to the superlunary world. Although the quaternion\ntheory is first mentioned in Thema Coeli (1612; see Bacon V\n[1889], 547\u201359), he provides a summary in his Novum\nOrganum (Bacon II [1887], 50):\n it has not been ill observed by the chemists in their\ntriad of first principles, that sulphur and mercury run through the\nwhole universe \u2026 in these two one of the most general consents\nin nature does seem to be observable. For there is consent between\nsulphur, oil and greasy exhalation, flame, and perhaps the body of a\nstar. So is there between mercury, water and watery vapors, air, and\nperhaps the pure and intersiderial ether. Yet these two quaternions or\ngreat tribes of things (each within its own limits) differ immensely\nin quantity of matter and density, but agree very well in\nconfiguration. (Bacon IV [1901], 242\u20133; see also V [1889],\n205\u20136; for tables of the two quaternions and Bacon's theory of\nmatter see Rees 1996, 126, 137; Rees 2000, 68\u20139) \n\nBacon regarded his cosmological\nworldview as a system of anticipations, which was open to revision in\nlight of further scientific results based on the inductive method\n(Rees 1975b, 171). It was primarily a qualitative system, standing\naside from both mathematical astronomers and Paracelsian chemists. It\nthus emphasized the priority which he gave to physics over mathematics\nin his general system of the sciences.\n\n\nBacon's two quaternions and his matter theory provide a\nspeculative framework for his thought, which was open to the future\nacquisition of knowledge and its technical application. His Nova\nAtlantis can be understood as a text which occupies an\nintermediate position between his theory of induction and his\nspeculative philosophy (Klein 2003c; Price 2002).\n\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that Bacon's speculative\nsystem was his way out of a dilemma which had made it impossible for\nhim to finish his Instauratio Magna. His turn towards\nspeculation can only be interpreted as an intellectual anticipation\nduring an intermediate phase of the history of science, when a gigantic\namount of research work was still to be accomplished, so that empirical\ntheories could neither be established nor sufficiently guaranteed.\nSpeculation in Bacon's sense can therefore be seen as a\npreliminary means of explaining the secrets of nature until methodical\nresearch has caught up with our speculations. The speculative stance\nremains a relative and intermediate procedure for the \u2018man of\nscience\u2019.\n",
