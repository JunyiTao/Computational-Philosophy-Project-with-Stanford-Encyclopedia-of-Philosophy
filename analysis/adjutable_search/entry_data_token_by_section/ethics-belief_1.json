    "main_text": "The Ethics of Belief: A brief history || The ethics of belief before the 19th-century\n1.2 The ethics of belief before the 19th-century\n\nThe phrase may be of 19th-century coinage, but there were\nobviously ethics of belief well before Clifford and James. Descartes\nsays in the Meditations that when forming a judgment,\n\u201cit is clear by the natural light that perception of the\nintellect should always precede (praecedere semper debere)\nthe determination of the will\u201d (1641, 7:60). In the context of a\nsearch for certain knowledge (scientia), Descartes maintains,\nwe have the obligation to withhold assent from all propositions whose\ntruth we do not clearly and distinctly perceive (clear and distinct\nperceptions themselves, by contrast, will produce belief ineluctably).\nIn other contexts, it may be both permissible and prudent to form a\nmere \u201copinion\u201d (opinio) whose truth we do not\nclearly and distinctly perceive. Even then, however, we are obliged to\nhave some sort of evidence before giving our assent. Thus\nDescartes advises Elizabeth that \u201cthough we cannot have certain\ndemonstrations of everything, still we must take sides, and in matters\nof custom embrace the opinions that seem the most probable,\nso that we may never be irresolute when we need to act\u201d (1645,\n4:295, my emphasis). \n\nLocke's ethics of belief is at least as strict: in the search for\nscientific knowledge as well as in all matters of \u201cmaximal\nconcernment,\u201d Locke says, it is to \u201ctransgress against our\nown light\u201d either to believe on insufficient evidence, or to\nfail to proportion our degree of belief to the strength of the\nevidence. In his discussion of \u201cFaith\u201d in the Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding, Locke famously moralizes:\n\nHe that believes without having any Reason for believing, may be in\nlove with his own Fancies; but neither seeks Truth as he ought, nor\npays the Obedience due to his Maker, who would have him use those\ndiscerning Faculties he has given him, to keep him out of Mistake and\nErrour. (1690, 687)\n\n\nTo form a belief about important matters without possessing sufficient\nevidence\u2014or to believe anything with a degree of firmness that\nis not proportioned to the strength of our evidence\u2014is to misuse\nour faculties and court all manner of error. It is also, for Locke, to\ncontravene the will of our \u201cMaker.\u201d Given his divine\ncommand theory of ethical rightness, it thus appears that such\nbehavior will be morally as well as epistemically wrong.\n\nBy contrast, Blaise Pascal and Immanuel Kant anticipated James by\nemphasizing that there are some very important issues regarding which\nwe do not and cannot have sufficient evidence one way or the other,\nbut which deserve our firm assent (on practical grounds) nonetheless.\n(For more on Pascal and Kant on Non-Evidentialism, see \u00a76.1\nbelow).\n",
