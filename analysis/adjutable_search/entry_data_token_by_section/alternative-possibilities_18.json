Below is one version of this dilemma, followed by two broad\ncategories of response.\n4.3.1 The Dilemma Stated\n\nAlthough it is not always explicit in FSCs, the counterfactual\nintervener appears to reply on some prior sign of what the agent is\nabout to do (Blumenfeld 1971). Black\u2019s device, for example, is\nsensitive to Jones\u2019 inclination: if it detects an inclination\n(call it \u201cPro-D\u201d) to choose the Democrat, Black will\nintervene; if it detects an inclination (\u201cPro-R\u201d) to\nchoose the Republican, Black will remain idle. As matters turn out,\nPro-R appears, Black does nothing, and Jones votes for the Republican\non his own. The dilemma is this: either Pro-R determines (or is\nassociated with something that determines\u2014a qualification to be\nleft out for simplicity) that Jones will vote for the Republican, or\nit doesn\u2019t. Either way, the FSC fails as a counterexample to\nPAP.\n\nSuppose first that Pro-R determines Jones\u2019 choice. In that case,\nit\u2019s no longer clear that Jones is responsible, for he\u2019s\nbeen locked into his choice by a prior cause. Certainly PAPs\ndefenders\u2014who tend to be libertarians about free will and moral\nresponsibility\u2014will balk at attributing responsibility to an\nagent whose actions are causally determined. Lost, then, is the\ninitially powerful appearance that Jones is morally responsible. On\nthe other hand, suppose Pro-R does not determine Jones\u2019 later\nchoice. In that case, Jones could have chosen otherwise, for the\nsign\u2014the only thing that stays Black\u2019s\nhand\u2014leaves open that Jones will vote for the Democrat. Jones\nthus has an alternative, and a robust one at that: this is no mere\nflicker.\n\nThe upshot is that there is no way of spelling out the details of this\nFSC in a way that preserves both the responsibility of the agent and\nthe lack of alternatives. Yet both are need for it to be a successful\ncounterexample. If all FSCs are structurally similar to this one, they\nare powerless against PAP. (Versions of this \u201cdilemma\ndefense\u201d include Kane 1985: 51; 1996: 142\u20133, 191\u20132;\nWiderker 1995; Ginet 1996; Wyma 1997; cp. Ekstrom 2000: 197 for a\nsimilar dilemma; and see Haji & McKenna 2004 for a critical\noverview. Vihvelin 2000 presents a different dilemma for FSCs, one\nthat nevertheless engages some of issues that will come up below; for\nan exchange on that alternative dilemma, see Fischer 2008; Vihvelin\n2008.)\n4.3.2 Responses to the Dilemma\n\nStart with the first horn and stipulate that Pro-R is a deterministic\ncause of Jones\u2019 subsequent choice. But to prevent the\nlibertarian from objecting immediately, let us suppose that\nJones\u2019 responsibility for his choice is not clear; indeed, we\ncan suppose\u2014even if initially shocking to Frankfurt\u2019s\nallies\u2014that he\u2019s not responsible for it.\nNevertheless, his being blameless is not due to something, namely\nBlack and his device, that rules out alternatives. In the actual\nscenario, Black remains passive, merely monitoring Jones\u2019 brain\nwithout interfering. The central idea here is that any factor causally\nisolated from an agent cannot be relevant to that person\u2019s moral\nresponsibility. So even if Jones isn\u2019t responsible,\nthis isn\u2019t entailed by his lacking alternatives; this\nwould be enough to refute PAP. (Fischer 1999: 113; cp. Frankfurt 2003.\nThis is just a first pass at what turns out to be a much more complex\nargument. For further refinement and criticism, see Goetz 2005;\nFischer 2010; Widerker & Goetz 2013; Fischer 2013; Palmer\n2014.)\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s defenders more often take on the second horn, on\nwhich Pro-R is not causally sufficient for Jones\u2019 choice. This\nmakes his responsibility clearer, especially for libertarians. But now\nit seems as if he could choose otherwise.\n\nPereboom (2001: ch. 1; see also Hunt 2005) replies that even with an\nindeterministic sign, we can construct a successful FSC in which Jones\nlacks alternatives. For variety, switch for a moment to\nPereboom\u2019s \u201cTax Evasion,\u201d though one could construct\nthe Black-Jones case to make similar points. Joe is an agent with\nlibertarian freedom who is considering whether to claim an illegal tax\ndeduction. He\u2019s inclined to do so, and as he deliberates, the\nonly factor that could potentially change his mind is a strong moral\nreason. Whether such a reason occurs to Joe is not determined (cp.\nMele 1995: ch. 12), and even if it does occur to him, it may not\nchange his mind. But at least a necessary condition of his\nchoosing not to evade taxes is the occurrence of such a reason\n(thereby entering a \u201cmental buffer zone\u201d\u2014these are\nthus called \u201cbuffer cases\u201d). Now add the counterfactual\nintervener, who wants Joe to break the law:\n\n\n\u2026 to ensure that [Joe] chooses to evade taxes, a neuroscientist\nnow implants a device which, were it to sense a moral reason occurring\nwith the specified force, would electronically stimulate his brain so\nthat he would choose to evade taxes. In actual fact, no moral reason\noccurs to him with such force, and he chooses to evade takes while the\ndevice remains idle (Pereboom 2001: 19).\n\n\nJoe seems responsible for his choice\u2014even by the\nlibertarian\u2019s lights\u2014but he could not have chosen\notherwise, for that would have required a moral reason, one that would\nhave triggered the intervention. In this FSC, the only overt sign is\nin the counterfactual sequence, but one might nevertheless worry that\nthe absence of this sign in the actual sequence is, contrary\nto the constraints of the second horn, causally sufficient for\nJoe\u2019s deciding to take the illegal deduction. So add that at any\nmoment leading up to the decision, a moral reason could occur to Joe.\nAs Jones deliberates, then, there\u2019s no point at which the\nabsence (up to that time) of a moral reason determines his deciding to\nevade taxes. (Critics of this buffer case include Ginet 2002; Goetz\n2002; Widerker 2006.)\n\nAnother way to avoid a causally sufficient sign of Jones\u2019 choice\nis simply to excise the sign itself, a feature, by the way, not always\nexplicit in Frankfurt\u2019s own FSCs. Suppose there is no sign or\nanything else causally sufficient for Jones\u2019 choice, and\nstipulate that the causal processes leading up to it are as the\nlibertarian sees fit. The question then is how to make Jones\u2019\nchoice inevitable, as a successful FSC requires. Filling in the\ndetails, Hunt (2000; 2003) imagines that the neural processes leading\nup to Jones\u2019 choice proceed without any outside interference.\nBut while these processes are indeterministic, it turns out that all\nof the alternative neural pathways\u2014those that might have\nrealized a decision to vote for the Democrat\u2014have been blocked.\nSuch \u201cblockage\u201d (Fischer 1999) gives Jones no alternative\nbut to vote for the Republican, yet he still makes the decision on his\nown\u2014the blockage never plays a role in his\ndeliberations\u2014and is thus morally responsible for it. In a\nrelated FSC (Mele & Robb 1998), Black has set up in Jones\u2019\nbrain a process that will, at the time of the decision, cause Jones to\nvote for the Republican, unless Jones decides at that time to\ndo so on his own. The process set up by Black does not interfere with\nJones\u2019 own deliberations which are assumed, as before, to\nsatisfy the libertarian. Nor does Black\u2019s process look for a\nsign of what Jones will decide. When, at the relevant time, Jones\ndecides on his own to vote for the Republican, it seems he is\nresponsible for the decision, even though the process Black has set up\nensures that Jones could not have decided otherwise. (It turns out\nthat this example too involves blockage, as the process set up by\nBlack has also \u201cneutralized\u201d the neural realization of any\nalternative decision.)\n\nAmong the reasons to worry about blockage cases is that they may,\ncontrary to what\u2019s intended, render Jones\u2019 choice causally\ndetermined, again putting his responsibility into question. After all,\nthe objection goes, there seems little if any difference between\nsaying (i) that structures and processes set up in Jones\u2019 brain\nblock off all alternatives other than choosing to vote for the\nRepublican, and (ii) that Jones\u2019 choice is causally determined\nby those same structures and processes. (For further critical\ndiscussion of such cases, see, e.g., O\u2019Connor 2000: 83\u201384;\nEkstrom 2002; Ginet 1996 [2001 addendum]; 2003; Kane 2003; Timpe 2013:\nch. 6. An important response to the dilemma defense not considered\nhere is Stump 1996; see also Goetz 1999; Stump 1999.)\n5. Beyond PAP\n\nSo far not much consensus has emerged from the literature on PAP.\nOptimists will still see progress of a sort: a principle taken for\ngranted through much of philosophy\u2019s history is now considered\nmore complex than it initially appeared, worth discussing, and\npossibly false. In any case, in this this final section, assume for a\nmoment that for some reason or other PAP should be rejected. What\nthen?\n5.1 Compatibilism Re-energized?\n\n\u00a71.1\n noted that combining PAP with some universal block of\nalternatives\u2014such as causal determinism\u2014rules out moral\nresponsibility. Here is a sketch of this kind of argument:\n\nP1.\n If determinism is true, then Kurt could not have done otherwise\nthan steal John\u2019s lunch.\nP2. \n If Kurt could not have done otherwise than steal John\u2019s\nlunch, then Kurt was not morally responsible for doing so.\nC. \n Therefore, if determinism is true, then Kurt was not morally\nresponsible for stealing John\u2019s lunch.\n\n\nThe first premise is supported by the Consequence Argument (see entry\non\n arguments for incompatibilism \u00a75):\n Given determinism, Kurt\u2019s theft was a necessary consequence of\nthe distant past plus the laws of nature. Kurt has no power over\neither of these, so he couldn\u2019t avoid stealing John\u2019s\nlunch. The second premise is an instance of PAP. And the conclusion\ncan be generalized to apply to any action: if determinism is true, no\none is responsible for anything they do.\n\nCompatibilists about determinism and moral responsibility reject this\nconclusion, so they must reject at least one of the premises. One\ntraditional sort of compatibilist accepts PAP (and P2), and targets P1\nand with it the Consequence Argument. This entangles the compatibilist\nin questions about the ability to do otherwise\n (\u00a71.3\n and\n \u00a74.2.1).\n However, if PAP is false, the compatibilist can avoid these\ndifficulties and reject P2 as unsupported. Without PAP in the way,\ncompatibilism receives new energy (see entry on\n compatibilism \u00a74).\n\nBut this route to compatibilism isn\u2019t straightforward. Even\nwithout the help of PAP, determinism may still preclude responsibility\ndue to the way it blocks alternatives (Frankfurt 1969;\nBlumenfeld 1971; Fischer 1982; Speak 2007). In FSCs, what makes the\naction inevitable doesn\u2019t interfere with the agent\u2019s own\ndeliberative processes or actions: the \u201cintervention\u201d in\nthese examples is merely counterfactual. By contrast, if determinism\nis true, its intervention is actual. After all, determinism entails\nthat every detail of how we choose and act is fixed by factors in the\ndistant past. As one might put it: in a deterministic world, we act as\nwe do because determinism has put us on the single track,\nbecause we could not do otherwise. So even if FSCs show that the mere\nblocking of alternatives does not preclude moral responsibility,\ndeterminism\u2019s distinctive way of blocking alternatives is still\na threat. (In light of this point, one could reformulate the above\nincompatibilist argument explicitly in terms of the particular way\ndeterminism blocks alternatives. The modified P2 would not require\nPAP, though it would need a weaker principle.)\n\nThis move shifts the burden back to compatibilists, who need to\nexplain why determinism, in spite of the way it blocks alternatives,\ndoesn\u2019t undermine responsibility. A traditional compatibilist\nreply points out that determinism\u2014unlike compulsion and other\nthreats to responsibility\u2014does not disrupt the normal operation\nof our faculties; in that sense, its \u201cinvasiveness\u201d is\nbenign (cp.\n \u00a73.1).\n A more ambitious line defends this point by developing an\nindependently plausible compatibilist account of moral responsibility.\nHere, briefly, are two such attempts (see entry on\n compatibilism\n for a detailed treatment of these and other compatibilist\noptions).\n\nOne is from Frankfurt (1971) and others, who say the morally\nresponsible agent is one who identifies with the motives that cause\nhim to act. Consider volitional necessity\n (\u00a73.3):\n While Luther is compelled by his conscience, he identifies with these\nmoral motives. Similarly, even if the willing addict can\u2019t help\nbut take the drug, he endorses the addiction. Such cases appeared\nearlier as attempted counterexamples to PAP. Now they are treated as\ncases of benign necessitation, ways of blocking alternatives, that,\nwhile operating through an agent\u2019s own deliberative processes,\nare compatible with moral responsibility. As long as the agent\nendorses (or at least does not reject) these processes, they\nneedn\u2019t preclude responsibility. If an account along these lines\ncan be independently defended, a compatibilist can claim to have met\nthe above demand, as identification, and thus responsibility, is\ncompatible with determinism.\n\nAnother influential account is from Fischer and Ravizza (1998; see\nalso Fischer 1994). One lesson of FSCs is that the explanation of\nmoral responsibility should be found in the actual sequence leading up\nto an agent\u2019s choice and action. In the Black-Jones case, what\nhappens in the alternative sequence, in which Black intervenes, is not\nrelevant to Jones\u2019 responsibility. It\u2019s not even clear\nthat Jones does anything in the alternative sequence\n (\u00a74.2.2).\n His moral responsibility, then, must be grounded in what actually\nhappens when Jones chooses on his own to vote for the Republican.\nFischer and Ravizza argue that the relevant portion of the actual\nsequence includes a \u201creasons-responsive mechanism\u201d\nproducing Jones\u2019 choice. As Jones deliberates, his deliberative\nfaculties are sensitive to reasons to vote for the Democrat as well as\nreasons to vote for the Republican. As it turns out, the latter\noutweigh the former, but there is still a scenario in which the\nreasons to vote for the Democrat to outweigh those to vote for the\nRepublican, Jones\u2019 deliberative faculties are sensitive to this\nfact, and he votes accordingly. In this sense, his deliberative\nfaculties can respond to competing reasons. (This Democratic-friendly\nscenario needn\u2019t be accessible to Jones; we can thus preserve\nFrankfurt\u2019s constraints.) Supposing that, given the appropriate\nbackground conditions, reasons-responsiveness secures moral\nresponsibility, the compatibilist has met the earlier demand, for\nhaving a reasons-responsive mechanism looks compatible with\ndeterminism.\n\nFischer and Ravizza\u2019s account allows that control of a sort is\nrequired for moral responsibility. One kind of control over\none\u2019s choices and actions is a matter of having alternatives: in\nthis sense, the control condition is equivalent to the rejected PAP;\nFischer and Ravizza call this \u201cregulative control\u201d. But\nthere\u2019s another kind, \u201cguidance control,\u201d that\ndoesn\u2019t require that the agent has alternatives available, and\nit\u2019s this that the reasons-responsiveness account attempts to\ncapture. Jones guides his action in the relevant sense, and for this\nreason can be responsible for what he does, even if, due to Black and\nhis computer, Jones lacks regulative control.\n5.2 Incompatibilism without PAP\n\nIn spite of compatibilist theories developed in the wake of FSCs, some\nphilosophers have remained convinced that even if PAP is false,\ndeterminism precludes responsibility. A compatibilist will challenge\nsuch philosophers to explain why this is so, if not because\ndeterminism blocks all alternatives.\n\nOne response to this challenge was in the previous section. Another\nmodifies the Consequence Argument so that it doesn\u2019t rely on\nPAP. This is the \u201cDirect Argument\u201d, direct\nbecause it doesn\u2019t go through PAP. It can be reconstructed along\nthe following lines (a formal version is in van Inwagen 1980):\n\nP1.\n If determinism is true, then Kurt\u2019s stealing John\u2019s\nlunch is an inevitable consequence of factors (namely, the distant\npast and laws) for which Kurt is not morally responsible.\nP2. \n If a person is not morally responsible for X, and Y\nis an inevitable consequence of X, then that person is not\nmorally responsible for Y.\nC. \n Therefore, if determinism is true, then Kurt is not morally\nresponsible for stealing John\u2019s lunch.\n\n\nThe first premise P1 follows from the definition of determinism as\nwell as some auxiliary claims about moral responsibility. P2 is the\n\u201ctransfer of blamelessness\u201d; whatever else might be said\nabout this premise, it does not require PAP. And the conclusion, which\ncan be generalized, follows from P1 and P2. But while this argument\ndoes not appeal to PAP, it appears that FSCs can be used against P2,\nthe transfer of blamelessness. The presence of Black, for which we can\nhardly blame Jones, makes the choice to vote Republican inevitable,\nbut Jones is for all that morally responsible for so-choosing (see\nFischer\u2019s introduction to his 1986; Fischer & Ravizza 1998:\nch. 6; and for more discussion, Stump 2000; McKenna 2008).\n\nA related answer to the compatibilist challenge is from the\n\u201csource incompatibilist\u201d or \u201ccausal history\nincompatibilist\u201d (Stump 1990; Klein 1990; Pereboom 1995, 2001;\nZagzebski 2000). Under determinism, you are not the source\u2014at\nleast not the ultimate source\u00ad\u2014of your actions.\nRather, the sources of your actions are found in the distant past.\nThis point seems to undermine your responsibility, at least one\ndesirable form of it (Mele 1996). Whatever the merits of source\nincompatibilism, it addresses the compatibilist challenge, for it says\nwhy determinism threatens moral responsibility\u2014namely, by ruling\nout sourcehood\u2014but without appealing to its blocking of\nalternatives, and thus without PAP. In this way, FSCs shift the\ndispute away from alternatives to the nature and importance of\nsourcehood. (Some source incompatibilists accept PAP or a closely\nrelated principle\u2014see, e.g., Kane 1996; Timpe 2013: ch.\n9\u2014but we are for now assuming PAP is false.)\n5.3 Replacement Principles\n\nOne of the results of FSCs has been a long list of principles similar\nto PAP, but intended to improve on it. Some of these keep PAP\u2019s\nfocus on action, while others switch to responsibility for\nconsequences or omissions\n (\u00a71.2).\n This final section samples a few of these replacement principles.\n5.3.1 Responsibility for Actions\n\nThis entry assumes that PAP\u2019s proposed condition is intended to\nbe explanatory, not merely necessary for responsibility. (Not all\nnecessary conditions are explanatory, as any Euthyphro-style problem\nwill show.) That is, the intent of the principle is that when a person\nlacks alternatives, it is at least in part in virtue of this\nthat she is not morally responsible (Fischer 1994: 140; Pereboom 2001:\n25). As formulated, however, PAP seems too weak for this purpose, as\nit appears to allow any alternative action to meet its requirement.\nSuppose that when Kurt stole John\u2019s lunch, he had an\nalternative, but it was so remote from his mind, so irrelevant to his\ncircumstances, that he never considered it: Kurt could have sat down\nand whistled a tune. Although this is an alternative to stealing\nJohn\u2019s lunch, it is not the sort that could potentially explain\nhis responsibility. Thus finding PAP too weak, McKenna strengthens its\nrequirements:\n\n\nPAP-significant: a person is morally responsible for\nA-ing only if she could have performed some alternative action\nB such that (i) B-ing was in her control; (ii)\nB-ing is less morally bad than A-ing; and (iii) it would\nhave been reasonable by her lights for her to consider B-ing as\nan alternative to A-ing. (simplified from McKenna 2003:\n209)\n\n\nCondition (i) brings to mind the earlier discussion of robustness\n (\u00a74.2.2),\n but (iii) is the focus at the moment, as it shows why Kurt\u2019s\nsit-and-whistle alternative is not enough to ground his\nresponsibility: it was not reasonable for him to consider this as an\noption. McKenna rejects PAP as \u201ctoo inclusive\u201d, favoring\ninstead a principle with these more significant constraints. Having\nsaid that, he argues that even this improved principle falls to an\nFSC, one that, however, leaves open plenty of insignificant\nalternatives to assuage libertarian concerns (see Robinson 2014 for\ncritical discussion).\n\nOne apparent lesson from PAP-significant is that, contrary to the\nsimplifying assumption adopted at the outset of this entry, one cannot\ncleanly separate PAP\u2019s condition on moral responsibility from\nepistemic requirements (cp. Mele 2010). In particular, in order for\nalternatives to count as explanatory in the relevant sense, they must\nbe reasonable from the point of view of the agent. Similar\nentanglements arise when one considers PAP\u2019s historical clause\n (\u00a73.3;\n see, e.g., Ginet 1996; Ekstrom 2000: 211). Luther is responsible for\nhis defiant act even if he could not have at the time done otherwise.\nHis responsibility can be \u201ctraced\u201d to past self-forming\nchoices in which he could have done otherwise. If these are to help\nexplain his responsibility when brought before Charles V, it seems as\nif Luther must in the past have known, at least in broad outline, how\nthose choices would shape his future actions. But if there are such\nepistemic conditions in PAP\u2019s historical rider, there may be\nproblems looming, ordinary cases (not FSCs) in which a person is\nresponsible for her action at t, cannot at t do\notherwise, and yet whose responsibility cannot be traced to choices in\nthe past with the appropriate epistemic credentials. (See Vargas 2005,\nand for discussion, Fischer & Tognazzini 2009; Shabo 2015.)\n\nThere are other action-focused replacements for PAP worth considering.\nBut because action has been in play for most of this entry, the\nconcluding sub-sections look at responsibility for something other\nthan action: consequences and omissions.\n5.3.2 Responsibility for Consequences\n\nIt seems clear that sometimes we are responsible for the consequences\nof our actions (for dissent, see Frankfurt 1983). Recall that Meghan\nis responsible, not just for ruining Sean\u2019s tea by putting salt\nin it (an action), but for Sean\u2019s tea being ruined (a\nconsequence). Call this consequence a \u201cstate of affairs\u201d.\nPerhaps one can also be responsible for states of affairs that\naren\u2019t the consequences of action. A homeowner is responsible\nfor the dangerous sink hole developing in her back yard, not because\nof anything she did, but due simply to negligence. However one is to\ntreat such cases, they are here set aside to focus on states of\naffairs that are more clearly the consequences of actions. And not\nsurprisingly, there is a replacement for PAP explicitly about these\n(this principle and much of what follows is adapted from van Inwagen\n1978; cp. Ginet 1996: 403):\n\n\nPAP-consequences: a person is morally responsible for\na consequence of what she has done only if she could have prevented\nit.\n\n\nThis has as much initial appeal as PAP. If the result of what Meghan\ndid would have happened anyway\u2014if it was, for her,\ninevitable\u2014then it\u2019s hard to see how she could be praised\nor blamed for it. Indeed, the examples that support PAP\n (\u00a72.2)\n could also be adapted to support this new principle. If it\u2019s\ninappropriate to praise a person\u2019s \u201cgenerous\u201d\ndonation to a charity when it\u2019s caused by a compulsion to give\nthings away, it is also inappropriate to praise that person for the\nconsequence of this act, namely the charity\u2019s windfall. And the\nreason is that the donor could not have prevented this state of\naffairs from obtaining.\n\nMore relevant to present concerns, however, is that this replacement\nmay not be vulnerable to the examples that plague PAP. Return to our\ncentral FSC: It seems as if Jones is responsible for voting Republican\n(an action) because he does so on his own, for his own reasons. But\nnow consider a resulting state of affairs, say, the Republican\u2019s\nhaving one more vote. This would have obtained no matter what Jones\ndid, or failed to do, on his own. Due to Black, the obtaining of the\nstate of affairs is not (as Jones\u2019 action is) sensitive to how\nthings proceed with Jones\u2019 own deliberative processes. One thus\nloses any sense in which Jones is the author of the consequence, and\nwith it any sense in which he is responsible. This creates some space\nbetween PAP-Consequences and PAP, permitting the former to stand when\nthe latter falls.\n\nHere a state of affairs is a universal: whether Jones votes for a\nRepublican on his own or because of Black\u2019s intervention, one\nand the same consequence obtains. In this way, the object of moral\nappraisal (the state of affairs) doesn\u2019t turn on how things\nactually go for Jones. But matters look different if the consequence\nis instead construed as a concrete particular, something produced by\nJones in the actual scenario. In that case, PAP-consequences looks\nvulnerable to FSCs in just the same way PAP is. When Jones votes for\nthe Republican, the particular consequence\u2014that event\nof one vote\u2019s being cast for a Republican\u2014seems to be\nsomething Jones produced on his own, and is thus responsible for.\n(Whether numerically the same event would have obtained in the\ncounterfactual scenario is a controversial issue, one whose resolution\ncould yield a version of the \u201cflicker\u201d strategy considered\nin\n \u00a74.2.2.)\n Let us in any case continue to assume that a consequence is a\n(universal) state of affairs.\n\nEven under this assumption, might this replacement fall to FSCs? The\nabove defense suggests not, but this has not prevented philosophers\nfrom trying, and with a variety of examples (e.g., Heinaman 1986; Rowe\n1989; Klein 1990: ch. 2; Fischer & Ravizza 1998: ch. 4). Here is\none thought to motivate such a project: Even if a consequence of an\nagent\u2019s action was inevitable, we can still make sense of her\ncausing that state of affairs to obtain, which thus looks like the\nresult of something she did, even if it would have obtained anyway.\nPerhaps this is enough to make the state of affairs sensitive to the\nactual sequence by which it was produced, grounding the agent\u2019s\nmoral responsibility, as an FSC requires. Rowe (1989), for example,\nimagines you are on a train headed down Track 2, a track that leads to\na safe stopping point. If you throw a switch, the train will go onto\nanother track, Track 1, on which a dog is tied. Unbeknownst to you,\nthere is someone (Peter) who is poised to throw that switch if you\ndon\u2019t. As it turns out, you throw the switch on your\nown\u2014Peter doesn\u2019t act at all\u2014and the train goes down\nTrack 1, killing the dog. Rowe says you caused the dog\u2019s death\nand are in fact morally responsible for it. (As usual, assume other\nstandard requirements are met.) Yet that consequence, the dog\u2019s\ndeath, was inevitable: there was nothing you could have done to\nprevent it. (For a successor to PAP-consequences, one that may handle\npotential counterexamples more easily, see Sartorio 2012.)\n5.3.3 Responsibility for Omissions\n\nSometimes a person is responsible for not acting: Blame Luke\nthe indifferent lifeguard for failing to save the drowning swimmer.\nCredit Emily for not cheating on a test. Let us formulate one more\nreplacement for PAP, using \u201comission,\u201d broadly, for any\nfailure to act:\n\n\nPAP-omissions: a person is morally responsible for\nwhat she didn\u2019t do only if she could have done it.\n\n\nAccording to this new principle, if the waters were too treacherous\nfor a rescue, Luke is blameless for his failure. (He may still be\nresponsible for failing to try, or for failing to call for help.)\nSimilarly, Emily is responsible for not cheating only if she could\nhave done so. If, due to a fear of being caught, she was unable to\ncheat, or if the means to cheat were simply unavailable to her, she\ncould not be credited for her omission, at least not on that occasion.\nPAP-omissions is here treated as its own stand-alone principle, though\nthere is some metaphysics behind such an assumption (Clarke 2012; S.\nBernstein 2015). The present question is whether it can survive the\ndemise of PAP.\n\nIt appears not, for this replacement looks vulnerable to many of the\nsame arguments\n (\u00a73).\n But to test this alleged symmetry, focus in particular on whether an\nFSC can be constructed as a counterexample to PAP-omissions (van\nInwagen 1978, 204\u20135): Bob sees a man being robbed and beaten\noutside of his house. After considering whether to call the police,\nBob decides not to get involved, calculating that it wouldn\u2019t be\nworth the trouble. For his own reasons, then, Bob refrains from\ncalling the police. What Bob didn\u2019t know, however, is that the\ndue to a technology disaster, all of the phones in the city are out of\norder and will be for hours. It seems then that Bob isn\u2019t\nresponsible for failing to call the police. And plausibly,\nPAP-omissions explains why he\u2019s off the hook: due to the\ntelephone disaster, he could not have called the police. (He might\nstill be responsible for failing to try to call the police, but trying\nis something he could have done.) Given the present assumption that\nPAP is false, what emerges from such examples is, contrary to initial\nappearances, an important asymmetry: \n\n\nmoral responsibility for an action does not require the freedom to\nrefrain from performing the action, whereas moral responsibility for\nfailure to perform an action requires the freedom to perform the\naction. (Fischer & Ravizza 1991: 262, with similar examples; they\nlater retract the asymmetry claim)\n\n\nHere\u2019s one try at explaining this asymmetry (Fischer\n1985\u201386: 267\u2013268): moral responsibility for\nanything\u2014action, consequence, omission\u2014requires a certain\nkind of control, though what kind of control is needed may vary\ndepending on the case. Now grant that FSCs show, contra PAP, that\nregulative control\n (\u00a75.1)\n isn\u2019t required for responsibility for actions: guidance control\nis enough (assuming other conditions on moral responsibility are met).\nWhen omissions are in play, however, there is no potential object of\nguidance control, for there is nothing to guide. For omissions, the\nonly kind of control available to satisfy the control requirement is\nregulative control. No wonder then that FSCs fail to refute\nPAP-omissions, as these cases remove the only sort of control one\ncould have over an omission.\n\nThat said, not everyone grants the claimed asymmetry. Both PAP and\nPAP-omissions should fall together (Frankfurt 1994; Glannon 1995;\nFischer & Ravizza 1998: ch. 5; or stand together: Swenson 2016).\nConsider one final FSC, this time bringing the omission inside to the\n\u201clocus of responsibility\u201d: a choice (or in this case, the\nlack of one). Luke the indifferent lifeguard fails to save the\nswimmer, and indeed fails even to try, for reasons entirely his own:\nhe\u2019s lazy and indifferent. But now add that unbeknownst to Luke,\nhad he even considered saving the swimmer, he would have been\nparalyzed by an overwhelming fear, compelling him to remain inactive,\nnot even choosing or trying to save the swimmer. Here there is no\noverdetermination, for the fear and the underlying pathology remain\ndormant in the actual scenario: the only causal factors relevant to\nthe omission are Luke\u2019s own cognitive states and values, which\nappear to exert a kind of responsibility-relevant control over his\nfailure. This looks like a genuine FSC, and, if so, a counterexample\nto PAP-omissions. (For more on the considerable complexities involved\nwith PAP-omissions, see McIntyre 1994; Sartorio 2005; Clarke 2014;\nFischer 2017.)",
