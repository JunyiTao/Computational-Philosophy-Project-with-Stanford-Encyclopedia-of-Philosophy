    "main_text": "\n\n\nOpen a textbook in biology and you\u2019ll find a purported\ndefinition of life, usually in the form of a list of characteristics\nthat apply to organisms, their parts, their interactions, or their\nhistory. Often these definitions will be nothing more than descriptions\nor rely on more controversial theoretical commitments. \n\n\nLike many basic concepts, it is difficult to non-controversially\ndefine life. Most people simply avoid the issue by ignoring marginal\ncases, accepting the vagueness of the boundary cases, or setting aside\nthe whole issue as beyond their scope. Nonetheless, there are many\npeople whose work seems to require a rigorous demarcation of life,\nespecially in new scientific contexts, such as astrobiology, origins of\nlife, or synthetic biology. As such, the nature of life continues to be\na hotly debated topic.\n\nThis article focuses on the subject matter of biology: life. The\nfirst half of this article will focus on attempts to characterize life\nby both philosophers and scientists. The first section will describe\nalternative accounts of definitions, its two subsections will cover\nhistorical and contemporary definitions, and section 2 covers the\nrecent countertrend in skepticism toward definitions of life.\nBecause the various stakeholders have different goals, the second half\nwill focus on those goals. Sections 3, 4, and 5 cover topics that\nsome believe require a definition of life: artificial and synthetic\nlife, the origin(s) of life, and the search for life in the Universe.\nSection 6 covers entities that are much larger or smaller than\norganisms, while section 7 covers the role life takes in the context\nof society, especially with respect to questions raised by new\ntechnology.\n",
