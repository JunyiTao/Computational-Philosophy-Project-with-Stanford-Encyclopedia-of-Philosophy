    "main_text": "Cosmology and Physics\n5. Cosmology and Physics\n\nWe have very little evidence for Archytas\u2019 cosmology, yet he was\nresponsible for one of the most famous cosmological arguments in\nantiquity, an argument which has been hailed as \u201cthe most\ncompelling argument ever produced for the infinity of space\u201d\n(Sorabji 1988, 125). The argument is ascribed to Archytas in a\nfragment of Eudemus preserved by Simplicius (= A24), and it is\nprobably to Archytas that Aristotle is referring when he describes the\nfifth and \u201cmost important\u201d reason that people believe in\nthe existence of the unlimited (Ph. 203b22 ff.). Archytas\nasks anyone who argues that the universe is limited to engage in a\nthought experiment (this is one of the first recorded thought\nexperiments in antiquity): \u201cIf I arrived at the outermost edge\nof the heaven, could I extend my hand or staff into what is outside or\nnot? It would be paradoxical [given our normal assumptions about the\nnature of space] not to be able to extend it.\u201d The end of the\nstaff, once extended will mark a new limit. Archytas can advance to\nthe new limit and ask the same question again, so that there will\nalways be something, into which his staff can be extended, beyond the\nsupposed limit, and hence that something is clearly unlimited. Neither\nPlato nor Aristotle accepted this argument, and both believed that the\nuniverse was limited. Nonetheless, Archytas\u2019 argument had great\ninfluence and was taken over and adapted by the Stoics, Epicureans\n(Lucretius I 968\u2013983), Locke and Newton, among others, while\neliciting responses from Alexander and Simplicius (Sorabji 1988,\n125\u2013141). For a discussion of the relation between\nArchytas\u2019 thought experiment and other thought experiments in\nantiquity see Ierodiakonou 2011. Not all scholars have been impressed\nby the argument (see Barnes 1982, 362), and modern notions of space\nallow for it to be finite without having an edge, and without an edge\nArchytas\u2019 argument cannot get started (but see Sorabji 1988,\n160\u2013163). Beyond this argument, there is only exiguous evidence\nfor Archytas\u2019 system of the physical world. Eudemus praises\nArchytas for recognizing that the unequal and uneven are not identical\nwith motion as Plato supposed (see Ti. 52e and 57e) but\nrather the causes of motion (A23). Another testimonium suggests that\nArchytas thought that all things are moved in accordance with\nproportion (Arist., Prob. 915a25\u201332 = A23a). The same\ntestimonium indicates that different sorts of proportion defined\ndifferent sorts of motion. Archytas asserted that \u201cthe\nproportion of equality\u201d (arithmetic proportion?) defined natural\nmotion, which he regarded as curved motion (for a different account of\nthe proportion of equality see De Groot 2014: 195\u2013207). This\nexplanation of natural motion is supposed to explain why certain parts\nof plants and animals (e.g. the stem, thighs, arms and trunk) are\nrounded rather than triangular or polygonal. Some scholars argue that\nit was the influence of Archytas that led Plato and Eudemus to\nemphasize uniform circular movement in explaining the heavens (Zhmud\n2006: 97). An explanation of motion in terms of proportion fits well\nwith the rest of evidence for Archytas, but the details remain\nobscure.\n",
