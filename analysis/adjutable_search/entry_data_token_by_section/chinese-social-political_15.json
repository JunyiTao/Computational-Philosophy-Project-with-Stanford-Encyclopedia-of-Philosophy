    "main_text": "The Neo-Confucian Era || Final Thoughts\n4.3 Final Thoughts\n\nAccording to most Neo-Confucians, revering the emperor meant both\nritual respect for the role of the emperor and obedience to the\nlegitimate authority of the emperor, but not unthinking loyalty to the\nruler no matter what he might do or say. Ultimate loyalty is owed to\nno individual but to the Way, which Neo-Confucians also discuss in\nterms of \u201ccosmic Pattern (tianli)\u201d\u2014that is,\nthe ultimate harmony of all things. Neo-Confucians lived in a public\nculture in which it was expected, at least in principle, that\nministers show their loyalty by courageously pointing out flaws and\nremonstrating with their rulers. And many Neo-Confucians, including\nZhu Xi, quietly or reluctantly acknowledged that there are cases when\none should not obey one\u2019s emperor, presumably after all attempts\nto dissuade the misguided ruler had been exhausted (Schirokauer 1978:\n141\u201343). We already saw some of this in the Donglin incident,\ndiscussed above; there are numerous other cases in which ministers,\neither individually or as a group, seek to upbraid or reform an errant\nruler. Often these disputes revolved around ritual matters, since the\nstability of human relationships as expressed through ritual was\ncentral to the overall harmony of the society and cosmos. Throughout\nmuch of the Neo-Confucian era political actors also find it necessary\nto justify their proposals through reference to classical texts, which\none contemporary scholar has therefore argued serve a partly\n\u201cconstitutional\u201d role (Song 2015). Notwithstanding the\nvarious ways in which literati can partly constrain the choices of\nrulers, though, there is little question that the power of rulers\nremains paramount. And while the deep-seated belief that harmony\nrelies on the well-being of the people is no doubt responsible for the\npeasantry living better lives than they might have otherwise, in the\nend Neo-Confucian socio-political thought grants them only one\npolitical outlet: revolt (Angle 2009: ch. 10).\n",
