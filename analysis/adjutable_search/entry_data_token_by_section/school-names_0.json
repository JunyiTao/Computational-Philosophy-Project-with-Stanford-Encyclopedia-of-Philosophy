    "main_text": "Background and Overview\n1. Background and Overview\n\nHan dynasty archivists associated seven figures with the \u201cSchool\nof Names\u201d: Deng Xi, Yin Wen, Hui Shi, Gongsun Long, Cheng-gong\nSheng, Huang Gong, and Mao Gong (Han History 30,\n\u201cBibliographical Treatise\u201d). To these we can add one\nfurther figure, Huan Tuan, whom China\u2019s earliest history of\nthought, \u201cUnder Heaven,\u201d Book 33 of the Zhuangzi,\npairs with Gongsun Long. About the last four of these men virtually\nnothing is\n known.[1]\n About the first four, we know more, but not much. There is little\nfirst-hand evidence about what they thought, since nearly none of the\nwritings attributed to them by Han bibliographers survive. With the\nexception of a few brief texts attributed to Gongsun Long, everything\nwe know comes from quotations or anecdotes in other texts, including\nthe Zhuangzi, Xunzi, Annals of L\u00fc Buwei, Hanfeizi, and\nseveral Han dynasty anthologies. These second-hand accounts typically\ndate from long after the lifetime of the figures they describe, and\nthey may be embellished or dramatized, warped to fit their\nwriters\u2019 agenda, or even fictional. \n\nContemporary studies sometimes treat these disputers together with the\n later Mohists.\n Topics associated with them are addressed in Mohist texts, and\n\u201cUnder Heaven\u201d depicts sects of Mohists engaged in\n\u201cdisputes about the hard and white and the same and\ndifferent,\u201d two central themes of the disputers. The later\nMohists probably respected the individuals identified with the School\nof Names but were critical of them. Numerous passages in the Mohist\nDialectics appear to be either rebuttals of their ideas or\ndefenses of Mohist doctrines against their arguments. On the other\nhand, insofar as \u2018the School of Names\u2019 is simply a label\nfor early thinkers interested in language and dialectics, the later\nMohists themselves largely fit under this label. \n\nHui Shi, Gongsun Long, and the others have been described as Chinese\n\u201csophists,\u201d and there are indeed superficial similarities\nbetween them and the Greek sophists, at least as the two groups were\ncharacterized by their respective enemies. Their social role and the\nsubject matter of their inquiries were generally quite\n different.[2]\n But both were interested in language and philosophical issues\ninspired by reflection on language. Both taught rhetoric and argued\nlawsuits. Both were attacked for arguing purely to win, for being\nwilling to argue either side of any issue, and for propounding\nparadoxes, all without regard for the facts. Their inquiries led a few\nthinkers in each tradition toward relativism. At least some members of\nboth groups were itinerant, the Greeks moving from place to place\ngiving public exhibitions and offering instruction, the Chinese\ntypically seeking to win the ear of rulers and influence political\npolicy. \n\nThe disputers\u2019 focal activity appears to have been a form of\npublic debate or persuasion called \u201cdisputation\u201d or\n\u201cdistinction drawing\u201d (bian), which often took\nplace in the court of a regional lord or a state sovereign.\nDisputation appears to have been rooted partly in the practice of\nlitigation, partly in the rhetoric used by court advisors in the\n\u201cexplanations\u201d (shuo, also\n\u201cpersuasions\u201d) through which they tried to influence\npolitical policy. Primarily a type of analogical argumentation,\ndisputation, like much legal rhetoric, often took the form of citing a\nprecedent, analogy, or model (fa, also \u201claw\u201d) and\nexplaining why the case at hand should be treated similarly or\n not.[3]\n\nDisputation could be pursued for a variety of ends, some extolled by\nancient writers, some condemned. Constructively, it could be a means\nof clarifying and defending the right way (dao). Through it,\none could lead others to distinguish shi/fei (this/not-this,\nright/wrong) correctly and thus obtain knowledge. Of disputation in\nthis sense, Xunzi says that \u201cthe gentleman must engage in\ndisputation\u201d and The Annals of L\u00fc Buwei remarks\nthat in the course of study, one must occasionally engage in\n\u201cdisputation and persuasion\u201d (bian shuo) in order\nto expound the Way\n (dao).[4]\n This would also be the sense in which\n Mencius\n explains that he has no choice but to engage in disputation, since as\na follower of the sages he must attempt to rectify people\u2019s\nhearts and refute the pernicious sayings of Yang Zhu and\n Mo Di\n (Mencius,\n 3B:9).[5]\n\nBut disputation could also degenerate into a superficial game of\ntrying to outtalk the opponent, an idle contest of wits aimed at\ndefending sophistries, or even a simple quarrel. This side of\ndisputation explains Mencius\u2019s chagrined response when told he\nhas a reputation for being \u201cfond of disputation\u201d (3B:9).\nEarly texts are uniformly disparaging about such empty or flippant\ndisputation. The Annals of L\u00fc Buwei complains that\n\u201cThose in the world who study engage in much disputation. Their\nsayings are facile and expressions are upside-down. They don\u2019t\nseek the facts (shi, the actual things, what is real). They\nstrive to demolish each other, with victory as their [sole]\npurpose\u201d (15.8/368). \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d says that\ndisputers \u201cexaggerate others\u2019 hearts and change\nothers\u2019 intentions. They can defeat others\u2019 mouths, but\ncannot persuade their hearts.\u201d As to Hui Shi, \u201cHe took\nopposing others as the substance of his activity and desired to make a\nname for himself by defeating others; that\u2019s why he\ncouldn\u2019t get along with people\u201d (cf. Graham 1981:\n284\u201385). Sima Qian, the Han historian who may have coined the\nlabel \u201cSchool of Names,\u201d says in his account of the six\nschools that the disputers \u201cdetermine things only by names and\nneglect people\u2019s feelings.\u201d They twist words so\n\u201cpeople cannot get back to the thought\u201d they were trying\nto express (Shi Ji, Book 130). Practitioners of this sort of\nantagonistic or frivolous disputation cared only for victory, even at\nthe cost of distorting the opponent\u2019s point, and they defended\nbizarre claims without regard for the facts. \n\nFor further discussion of disputation in the context of early Chinese\nphilosophy, see the supplementary document.\n\nDisputation in Context\n\n\nThe next section will briefly explore the general themes that early\ntexts associate with the disputers. We will then look more closely at\nthe doctrines of the four known figures the Han History\nassigns to the School of Names. \n2. Main Themes\n\nEarly texts regularly associate the disputers with four themes.\n\u201cThe same and different\u201d (tong yi) and\n\u201chard and white\u201d (jian bai) are mentioned almost\ninvariably. \u201cDeeming so the not-so, admissible the\ninadmissible\u201d (ran bu ran, ke bu ke) and \u201cthe\ndimensionless\u201d (wu hou) appear slightly less often. A\ngood example is this excerpt from \u201cAutumn Waters,\u201d Book 17\nof the Daoist anthology Zhuangzi, in which Gongsun Long\nhimself is depicted mentioning three of these themes: \n\nWhen young, I studied the way of the former kings. When I grew up, I\nunderstood the practice of benevolence and righteousness. I united the\nsame and different, separated hard from white, made so the not-so and\nadmissible the inadmissible. I confounded the wits of the hundred\nschools and exhausted the eloquence of countless speakers. I took\nmyself to have achieved the ultimate. (cf. Graham 1981: 154)\n\n\nWhat are \u201cuniting the same and different,\u201d\n\u201cseparating hard from white,\u201d and \u201cmaking so the\nnot-so and admissible the inadmissible\u201d? Given the limited\nevidence, we cannot be completely sure what these phrases\u2014along\nwith \u201cthe dimensionless\u201d\u2014allude to. But most likely\nthey denote types of sophisms or paradoxes, not specific\nstatements or\n doctrines.[6]\n And early texts, especially the Mohist Dialectics, do give\nus enough information to make reasonable conjectures about the general\nissues they involve. (See the entry on the\n Mohist Canons.)\n2.1 Same and Different\n\nAs we saw above, \u201csame\u201d (tong) and\n\u201cdifferent\u201d (yi) are central concepts in ancient\nChinese theories of language, knowledge, and disputation, as\nrepresented by the Mohists and Xunzi. According to the Mohists,\n\u201csameness\u201d can refer to at least four types of relations:\nidentity; part-whole relations; being grouped together or co-located;\nand having some intrinsic similarity and thus being part of the same\n\u201ckind\u201d. This last variety of \u201csameness\u201d is\nprobably most important for our purposes here. Names names for\n\u201ckinds\u201d (lei)\u2014one type of general\nterm\u2014 are regarded as denoting all things or stuff\n(shi) that is \u201cthe same\u201d in one or more respects,\nsuch as all horses, which share the same shape (xing) and appearance\n(mao). Speakers can use language to communicate because they are\nfamiliar with the kinds of similar things that words refer to, and\nthus upon hearing a word know what the thing referred to \u201cis\nlike.\u201d The relations of \u201csame\u201d and\n\u201cdifferent\u201d determine what counts as correct matching of\nnames and stuff and thus what knowledge is. Disputation is\nfundamentally a process of debating whether the thing in question is\n\u201cthis\u201d (shi) or \u201cnot-this\u201d\n(fei), the same as or different from some model, paradigm, or\nanalogy. The issue of how to distinguish \u201csame\u201d from\n\u201cdifferent\u201d is thus pivotal to Chinese philosophy of\nlanguage, epistemology, and disputation. \n\nSome references to the disputers\u2019 interest in \u201cthe same\nand different,\u201d then, may allude to legitimate, if widely\nmisunderstood, inquiries into the foundations of language and\nknowledge. Gongsun Long\u2019s \u201cuniting the same and\ndifferent,\u201d on the other hand, probably refers to manipulating\nstandards for distinguishing different kinds in order to produce\nsophisms. The disputer could cite features of different kinds of\nthings by which they could be treated as the same or features of\nthings of the same kind by which they could be treated as different.\n(This strategy is suggested by the fifth thesis of Hui Shi, to be\ndiscussed below.) Such shifting of criteria for distinguishing\nsameness from difference is illustrated by many of the\ndisputers\u2019 sophisms. Among other examples, Hui Shi\u2019s\n\u201cThe sky is as low as earth, mountains are level with\nmarshes\u201d deems different things similar; some of the arguments\nfor Gongsun Long\u2019s \u201cA white horse is not a horse\u201d\ntreat things of the same kind\u2014horses and white horses\u2014as\ndifferent, playing largely on the ambiguity between \u201csame\u201d\nin the sense of being of the same kind and \u201csame\u201d in the\nsense of identity. \n\nManipulating the same and the different alters the distinctions that\nground our use of words and thus our standards of knowledge. (In the\nmost extreme case, uniting everything into a \u201cGreat One\u201d\nwould leave us unable to communicate linguistically and eliminate all\nconceptual or propositional knowledge.) The notion that we can realign\nthe boundaries of the same and different without limit signals a\nradical skepticism about the existence of natural kinds. Indeed, it\nthreatens to leave us without any knowledge at all, since the\nstandards by which to judge whether one knows something are never\nfixed. It also provides an approach to winning any disputation:\ninstead of seeking objective criteria that fix the correct\ndistinctions between things, disputers just redraw the distinctions\nbetween things or kinds in whatever way needed to establish their\nclaim. \n2.2 Hard and White\n\nIn later Mohist thought, \u201chard-white\u201d or \u201cas hard to\nwhite\u201d (jian bai) is a technical term for the relation\nbetween two things or two features of a thing that are inseparable and\n\u201cmutually pervasive\u201d\u2014that is, they completely\ncoincide throughout the same spatial\n location.[7]\n The paradigm of such features is the hardness and whiteness of a\ncompletely white stone. Another example is the length and breadth of\nan object (B4). Features that are \u201cas hard to white\u201d\n\u201cfill\u201d or \u201cpervade\u201d each other (B15). Thus\nthey are in a sense \u201ctwo,\u201d but unlike a pair of shoes, one\ncannot be taken away from the other (B4). The relation of \u201cas\nhard to white\u201d contrasts with that between two measured lengths,\nwhich cannot everywhere overlap without merging to form only a single\nlength, instead of the original two, and with that between any two\nmutually exclusive features, such as being an ox and being a horse. No\nsingle object can be both an ox and a horse, but an object can be both\nhard and white. \n\n\u201cSeparating hard and white,\u201d then, is treating mutually\npervasive features as if they were separable or detachable, like two\nspatially distinct objects or two removable physical parts of a whole.\n(As Graham points out (2003: 173), in contexts where \u201chard and\nwhite\u201d is mentioned alone, with no reference to\n\u201cseparating\u201d the two, the phrase may simply be a metaphor\nfor logic-chopping or hair-splitting debate in general.) A plausible\nexample of \u201cseparating hard and white\u201d is Gongsun\nLong\u2019s treating the color of a white horse as a thing separable\nfrom the shape, as when the text reads, \u201cThe white is not the\nhorse. A white horse is a horse together with white\u201d\n(\u201cWhite Horse Discourse\u201d). \n2.3 So and Not-So\n\n\u201cSo\u201d (ran) is frequently used to indicate that a\npredicate is true of a thing. It can also mean \u201cthe case\u201d\nor \u201chow things are.\u201d According to Mohist Canon A71,\nsomething is \u201cso\u201d when its features are similar to a model\nfor a certain kind of thing. \u201cAdmissible\u201d (ke)\nrefers to statements that are semantically or logically\n\u201cpossible\u201d\u2014that is, free of logical or pragmatic\ncontradiction. In contexts concerning action, \u201cadmissible\u201d\nrefers to what is permissible by moral, social, prudential, or other\nstandards. So \u201cmaking so the not-so, admissible the\ninadmissible\u201d refers to collapsing or reversing conventional\ndistinctions governing language use, judgment, morality, and courtesy.\nThe practical upshot is roughly the same as that of \u201cuniting\nsame and different,\u201d but the latter refers to kind relations\nbetween objects, \u201cmaking so the not-so\u201d to speech and\naction. \u201cMaking admissible the inadmissible\u201d was the\ntrademark of Deng Xi, the earliest figure associated with the School\nof Names, who became famous for his doctrine of \u201cboth sides\nadmissible\u201d (liang ke). \n\nPreventing the \u201cnot-so\u201d from being treated as\n\u201cso\u201d is precisely the point of \u201ccorrecting\nnames\u201d:\n\nIf names are correct, order obtains; if names are misplaced, disorder.\nWhat cause names to be misplaced are dissolute explanations\n(shuo, also \u201cpersuasions\u201d or\n\u201carguments\u201d). If explanations are dissolute, then the\ninadmissible is deemed admissible and the not-so so, the not-right is\ndeemed right and not-wrong wrong. (The Annals of L\u00fc\nBuwei, 16.8/400)\n\n\nCollapsing the distinction between so and not-so, admissible and\ninadmissible is a prominent topic in the famous \u201cDiscourse on\nEqualizing Things,\u201d Book 2 of the\n Zhuangzi.\n Though generally critical of the disputers (among whom its author may\nnevertheless once have numbered), the text agrees that such\ndistinctions can be collapsed or reversed, depending on what standards\nof judgment we choose to adopt. It is thus firmly opposed to the\northodoxy, represented by Analects (see the entry on the\n Confucius),\n the Mohists,\n Xunzi,\n and L\u00fc Buwei, that clear, fixed public standards must be set for\nthe use of names, since without them, patterns of use will vary and\nsocial chaos is likely to ensue. The Zhuangzi suggests that\ndisorder does not invariably follow from \u201clinguistic\nliberalism,\u201d and indeed that fixed standards are unattainable\nand unnecessary for communication. \n2.4 The Dimensionless\n\nThe fourth theme, the dimensionless (wu hou, literally\n\u201clacking thickness\u201d), is more obscure, mentioned only once\nin the Xunzi and once in the Annals of L\u00fc\nBuwei. The dimensionless probably refers to a geometric point.\nAccording to the Mohists, the dimensionless does not\n\u201cfill\u201d anything (A65). A starting point (duan) is\nthe dimensionless tip of a solid object (A61). Allusions to the\ndisputers sometimes contrast the dimensionless with \u201cthe\ndimensioned\u201d (you hou, \u201chaving thickness\u201d),\nwhich the Mohists explain as having something it is bigger than (A55).\nThe dimensionless is probably associated with the disputers because of\nHui Shi\u2019s paradox that \u201cThe dimensionless cannot be\naccumulated, yet its size is a thousand miles.\u201d (Points cannot\nbe accumulated, yet a great girth or length is the sum of the points\nthat constitute it.) In passages referring to the disputers and their\nsophistries, \u201cthe dimensionless\u201d probably alludes to any\nparadox arising from the concept of a geometric point or an\ninfinitesimal. \n3. Deng Xi\n\nDeng Xi (d. 501 B.C.E.) was China\u2019s earliest renowned lawyer and\nrhetorician. He has been called the \u201cfounding father of the\nChinese logical tradition\u201d (Harbsmeier 1998: 286), though this\nis probably an overstatement, since we lack evidence that he undertook\nany explicit study of argumentation or that he influenced the theories\nof the Mohists or Xunzi. As Harbsmeier (287) rightly points out,\nhowever, Deng Xi epitomizes the roots of Chinese disputation in legal\nrhetoric. He establishes a link between disputation and litigation\nthat continues throughout the classical period. Indeed, his reputation\nas a legal and political gadfly may have contributed to later\nauthoritarian thinkers\u2019 attitude that litigators disrupt social\norder and should be banned. \n\nAll of our very limited information about Deng Xi is second-hand,\ncomprising a one-line entry in the Zuo Commentary, curt\nattacks on him in the Xunzi, three anecdotes in The\nAnnals of L\u00fc Buwei, and a few stories in texts of later\n date.[8]\n According to the Han History, he was the author of two\nscrolls (pian) of writings, neither of which survives. The\nZuo Commentary (Duke Ding, Year 9), the earliest and most\nreliable of our sources, reports that he composed a penal code on\nbamboo strips, perhaps drawn up as an alternative to the official code\nof his home state of Zheng. By the time of the Han dynasty, however,\nthe code had been lost. \n\nXunzi alludes to Deng Xi\u2019s thought in three places, each time\npairing him with\n Hui Shi,\n though the men were from different states and lived about 200 years\napart. This incongruity suggests that the pair are being used\niconically to represent a certain general intellectual style or\norientation. Thus the sophistries Xunzi ascribes to them may not be\ntheir invention, or at least not Deng Xi\u2019s. Xunzi describes them\nas \u201cfond of dealing with strange doctrines and playing with\nbizarre expressions\u201d (6.6), of which he gives these examples\n(3.1):\n\nMountains and abysses are level. \nHeaven and earth are alongside each other.\nQi [on the east coast] and Qin [in the far west] are\nadjacent.\nEnter through the ear.\nExit through the mouth.\nHooks have whiskers.\nEggs have feathers.\n\n\nThe first two of these are similar to paradoxes attributed to Hui Shi\nin \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d (Zhuangzi, Book 33); we will\ndiscuss them in the section on\n Hui Shi.\n The seventh is also listed in \u201cUnder Heaven,\u201d but not\nattributed to Hui Shi there. This suggests that the list of paradoxes\nassociated with him was still fluid at the time of Xunzi\u2019s\nwriting. The third is similar to the spatial paradoxes of Hui Shi,\nalso to be discussed below. The sixth is obscure; some commentators\nemend \u201chooks\u201d to a similar graph for \u201cold\nwomen.\u201d The fourth and fifth are puzzling, since they are not\nobviously paradoxes or sophisms. Commentators often combine them into\na single sentence, but in the text all seven seem to be independent,\nthree-word sentences. \n\nXunzi\u2019s fundamental complaint about Hui Shi and Deng Xi is that\ntheir \u201cfrivolous investigations\u201d do not conform to\ntraditional ritual propriety and righteousness (3.1), an unsurprising\ncriticism given the Confucian\u2019s commitment to ritual\ntraining\u2014and thus conventional standards for the correct use of\nnames\u2014along with his general disdain for science and\nintellectual curiosity (12.3). They are \u201cincisive\u201d and\n\u201cclever,\u201d but their ideas are \u201cuseless,\u201d yield\nfew concrete results, and have no application to government (6.6).\nThey have \u201cno regard for the facts about right and wrong, so and\nnot-so\u201d (8.3). In the eyes of a 3rd-century B.C.E. Confucian\ntraditionalist, then, the 6th-century Deng Xi was emblematic of a\nbright, talented person who wastes his energy on pointless\nintellectual games and sophistry, perhaps with a deliberate disregard\nfor the truth, instead of earnestly committing himself to moral\ntraining and political administration.\n\nFor an account of Deng Xi\u2019s legal and political career, see this\nsupplementary document:\n\nDeng Xi\u2019s Exploits\n\n4. Yin Wen\n\nLittle is known of Yin Wen (fl. late 4th century B.C.E.), and it is\nunclear why the Han History classifies him with the\n\u201cSchool of Names.\u201d Perhaps the one scroll of writings by\nhim mentioned in the \u201cBibliographical Treatise\u201d was about\nlanguage. What little information we have about him comes mainly from\ntwo sources, the \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d essay and The Annals\nof L\u00fc Buwei, both of which are considerably later than his\nlifetime and thus must be taken mainly to be reporting legend. Neither\ntext attributes to him views on language or disputation. \u201cUnder\nHeaven\u201d links him to Song Xing, his teacher or colleague, and\nthe pair were among the many scholars who gathered at Jixia in Qi\nunder the patronage of King Xuan (r. 319\u2013301\n B.C.E.).[9]\n Xunzi rebuts several of Song Xing\u2019s doctrines at length but\ndoes not mention Yin Wen.\n\n\u201cUnder Heaven\u201d portrays Yin Wen and Song Xing as tireless\ncrusaders devoted to saving the world by advocating non-aggression, a\nlife of few, easily satisfied desires, and a tolerant, unbiased frame\nof mind. To promote these doctrines, they \u201ctraveled the world,\npersuading the high and instructing the low.\u201d In relations with\nothers, to save people from fighting they taught that \u201cto be\ninsulted is no disgrace,\u201d and to save the world from war, they\ntaught \u201cforbid aggression and put troops to rest.\u201d (As the\nname suggests, the Warring States era was marked by frequent,\ncatastrophic wars.) Concerning the self, they held that the inherent\ndesires are few and shallow, a doctrine that, if true, would remove\nmany potential reasons for conflict. \u201cTheir starting point in\ndealing with things was avoiding enclosures,\u201d or psychological\nbarriers due to prejudice or dogmatic commitment which tend to result\nin biased or one-sided judgments. Such \u201cenclosures\u201d are\nfrequently also a source of conflict, since they may prevent one from\nappreciating all relevant features of a situation or understanding\nothers\u2019 point of view. Yin Wen and Song Xing emphasized that the\nheart itself has a kind of \u201cconduct,\u201d independent of\nexternal conduct. In their anti-war stance and emphasis on benefit,\nthey display affinities with Mohist thought: \u201cIf something was\nof no advantage to the world, understanding it was not as good as\nabandoning it.\u201d But the doctrines of tolerance and avoiding bias\nare genuinely novel, and are probably the reason Song Xing is singled\nout for praise in the Zhuangzi (Book 1). \n\nThe Annals of L\u00fc Buwei depicts Yin Wen in an audience\nwith King Min of Qi (r. 300\u2013284 B.C.E.), defending the doctrine\nthat to be insulted is not disgraceful. (Again, we should keep in mind\nthat the details of the story may be mostly later invention.) The\nanecdote vividly illustrates several of the main techniques by which\nthe disputers conducted their craft. Yin Wen identifies distinguishing\nfeatures for calling things by a certain name and employs models and\nanalogies to persuade the king. The context of the passage is a\ndiscussion of \u201ccorrecting names.\u201d Because he failed to\ncorrect his own use of names, King Min knew enough to be fond of\n\u201cofficers\u201d but not how to distinguish the sort of people\nproperly referred to as \u201cofficers.\u201d (Shi,\n\u201cofficer,\u201d was a social rank similar to\n\u201cknight,\u201d but by this era it had lost most of its martial\nconnotation.) Yin Wen proposes that \u201cofficers\u201d are\ndistinguished by four types of conduct: they are filial in serving\ntheir parents, loyal in serving their ruler, trustworthy toward\nfriends, and brotherly toward neighbors. The king agrees, indicating\nalso that this is just the sort of person he would appoint as a\ngovernment official. Yin Wen asks whether the king would still appoint\nsuch a person supposing that, on being insulted in public, he did not\nfight. The king replies that to be insulted is a disgrace; he would\nnot appoint a disgraced person. \n\nYin Wen said: \u201cThough when insulted he does not fight, he has\nnot strayed from the four types of conduct. Not straying from the four\ntypes of conduct, this is not losing that by which he is an officer.\nIf, not losing that by which he is an officer, in the one case the\nKing would appoint him an official, in the other case not, then is\nwhat we earlier called an \u2018officer\u2019 indeed an\n\u2018officer\u2019?\u201d\n\n\nThe King had no response.\n\nYin Wen said, \u201cSuppose there is a man here, when governing his\nstate, if people do wrong he condemns them, if people do no wrong he\ncondemns them; if people commit a crime he punishes them, if people\ncommit no crime he punishes them. Then would it be admissible for him\nto despise the people for being hard to govern?\u201d\n\nThe King said, \u201cNot admissible.\u201d \n\nYin Wen said, \u201c\u2026The King\u2019s command says: \u2018One\nwho kills another dies, one who injures another is maimed.\u2019 The\npeople, fearing the King\u2019s command, dare not fight even when\ndeeply insulted; this is fulfilling the King\u2019s command. Yet the\nKing says, \u2018Not daring to fight when insulted, this is a\ndisgrace.\u2019 Now to call it a disgrace, it\u2019s this\nthat\u2019s called \u2018condemning it\u2019. In the one case to\nappoint a person as an official, in the other not, this is deeming it\na crime. This is the King punishing someone when he has committed no\ncrime.\u201d\n\nThe King had no response. (16.8/402)\n\n\nKing Min is presented as an example of someone whose use of names,\nsuch as \u2018officer\u2019, is incorrect: name and form do not\n\u201cfit.\u201d As a result, \u201cthose he calls worthy are\nunworthy, what he calls good is depraved, and what he calls admissible\nis perverse.\u201d Interestingly, the text employs terminology that\ndovetails with later Mohist semantic theory and epistemology. It\nexplains that the King did not know the \u201creason\u201d or\n\u201cbasis\u201d for deeming people \u201cofficers,\u201d using\nthe same term as the Mohists\u2014gu\u2014and alludes to\nhis poor ability to classify or \u201csort\u201d (lun)\nthings into kinds, which in later Mohist epistemology is the mark of\nunderstanding. Though the Annals story does not make this point\nexplicitly, we can link the King\u2019s erroneous\n\u201csorting\u201d to Yin Wen\u2019s doctrine of \u201cavoiding\nenclosures.\u201d The King\u2019s judgments about officers are\n\u201cenclosed\u201d by his dogmatic conviction that to be insulted\nis a disgrace and that an officer must answer challenges to his honor\nwith violence.\n5. Hui Shi\n\nHui Shi (fl. 313 B.C.E.) is a complex figure, familiar and indistinct\nby turns. He is mentioned in at least eight early texts. Only two, the\nXunzi and the Zhuangzi \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d\nessay, give any information about his philosophical views, and they\nmerely attribute a series of theses to him without recording his\narguments. For a review of biographical information about him, see the\nsupplementary document.\n\nLife of Hui Shi\n\n\nWe have no direct evidence of Hui Shi\u2019s views on language and\nmeaning. But as Graham points out (1989: 81), a story preserved in a\nHan dynasty text suggests that he may have held a view similar to that\nof the Mohists (Canon B70) (see the entries on\n Mohism\n and the\n Mohist Canons).\n Language enables us to communicate by indicating that the objects\nreferred to are similar to things we already know, the kinds of\nobjects conventionally denoted by those words.\n\nA client said to the King of Liang, \u201cIn talking about things,\nHui Shi is fond of using analogies. If you don\u2019t let him use\nanalogies, he won\u2019t be able to speak.\u201d The King said,\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d The next day he saw Hui Shi and said, \u201cI\nwish that when you speak about things, you speak directly, without\nusing analogies.\u201d Hui Shi said, \u201cSuppose there\u2019s a\nman here who doesn\u2019t know what a dan is. If he says,\n\u2018What are the features of a dan like?\u2019 and we\nanswer, saying, \u2018The features of a dan are like a\ndan,\u2019 then would that communicate it?\u201d The King\nsaid, \u201cIt would not.\u201d \u201cThen if we instead answered,\n\u2018The features of a dan are like a bow, but with a\nbamboo string,\u2019 then would he know?\u201d The King said,\n\u201cIt can be known.\u201d Hui Shi said, \u201cExplanations are\ninherently a matter of using what a person knows to communicate what\nhe doesn\u2019t know, thereby causing him to know it. Now if you say,\n\u2018No analogies,\u2019 that\u2019s inadmissible.\u201d The King\nsaid, \u201cGood!\u201d (Shuo Yuan, Ch. 11; cf. Graham\n1989: 81)\n\n\nAs we would expect from mainstream Chinese theories of language and\ndisputation, Hui Shi is accustomed to explaining things by appeal to\nanalogies. Indeed, his answer to the king is itself an analogy, or at\nleast an illustrative example (the Chinese word for\n\u201canalogy,\u201d pi, refers to both). We can also\nnotice from the story that in seeking to learn about something\nunknown, one does not ask for a definition of the object, but\nfor a description of what its features \u201care like.\u201d The\nstandard response is to cite a familiar analogue and then point out\nthe differences between the unknown object and the familiar one.\nCommunication proceeds not by knowing \u201cmeanings,\u201d but by\nknowing how to distinguish similar from different kinds of\n things.[10]\n\n\u201cUnder Heaven\u201d is overwhelmingly critical of Hui Shi:\n\nHui Shi daily applied his wits in disputation with the others, but\nonly in comparison with the disputers of the world was he exceptional,\nthat\u2019s the bottom of it.\u2026Weak in virtue, strong on\nexternal things, his path was crooked. Viewed from the perspective of\nthe Way (dao) of Heaven and Earth, Hui Shi\u2019s abilities\nwere like the labors of a mosquito or gnat. Even with respect to\nexternal things, what use were they? (cf. Graham 1981: 285)\n\n\nThe text concludes that he wasted his talents \u201cchasing after the\nmyriad things,\u201d in his many directions of inquiry, instead of\nconcentrating on a single path. As a result, he only \u201cended with\na name for being good at disputation.\u201d This dismissal is less an\nobjective evaluation of Hui Shi\u2019s inquiries than an expression\nof the intellectual orientation of the essay\u2019s Han dynasty\nauthor, who values only moral cultivation and commitment to an ethical\nand political dao (way), not inquiry for inquiry\u2019s\nsake. It seems likely that we would have considered Hui Shi\u2019s\nexplanations of \u201cthe myriad things\u201d to be of great\ninterest. \n5.1 The Ten Theses\n\nOur only detailed information about Hui Shi\u2019s doctrines comes\nfrom two sources: the seven statements attributed jointly to him and\n Deng Xi\n in the Xunzi (3.1), which we looked at briefly above, and\nthe \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d essay, which attributes ten theses to\nhim, some paradoxical. \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d was probably written\nlong after Hui Shi\u2019s death, and only one of its ten theses\nappears in the much earlier Xunzi list. Hence we cannot be\nsure the ten theses were indeed Hui Shi\u2019s; some or all may have\nbeen the work of anonymous followers who adopted him as their\nfigurehead. Fortunately, this historical issue is irrelevant to their\nphilosophical interest. Either way, the theses are intriguing ideas\nformulated by one or more Chinese thinkers probably sometime during\nthe late 4th or the 3rd century B.C.E. The arguments for the theses\nhave been lost, and as a result some are extremely obscure. But others\nare reasonably clear or at least open to educated conjecture. \n\nThe ten theses revolve around the theme that distinctions are not\ninherently fixed, but relative to a perspective, and thus can be\nredrawn or collapsed as we like simply by shifting perspectives.\nSeveral of the paradoxes focus on negating commonsense distinctions,\nin particular spatial and temporal ones, partly by appeal to the\nrelativity of comparisons and partly by appeal to indexicals (Hansen\n1992: 262). (A high mountain is not high when seen from space; if I\nwalk southward, a spot that is south of me now will in seconds be\nnorth of me.) The fifth thesis, on \u201cthe same\u201d and\n\u201cdifferent,\u201d seems to provide a key to several, perhaps\nall of the others. It indicates that on some scale or another,\nanything can be deemed \u201cthe same\u201d or\n\u201cdifferent.\u201d \n\nThe theses are presented in \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d as follows:\n\nHui Shi had many directions (fang, also\n\u201cmethods\u201d). His books filled five carts; his dao\n(way) was contrary; his sayings did not hit the mark. Intending to\ntabulate things, he said:\n\n\nThe ultimately great has no outside, call it the Great One. The\nultimately small has no inside, call it the Small One.\nThe dimensionless cannot be accumulated, its size is a thousand\nmiles.\nHeaven is as low as earth, mountains are level with marshes. \nJust as the sun is at noon, it is declining. Just as things are\nalive, they are dying.\nThe same on a large scale but different from what is the same on a\nsmall scale, this is called \u201csame and different on a small\nscale.\u201d The myriad things all being the same or all being\ndifferent, this is called \u201csame and different on a large\nscale.\u201d \nThe south has no limit yet has a limit.\nToday go to Yue but arrive yesterday. \nLinked rings can be disconnected.\nI know the center of the world. It is north of Yan [the\nnorthernmost state] and south of Yue [the southernmost].\nUniversally care for the myriad things. Heaven and earth are one\nunit.\n\n\nHui Shi took these to be of great significance. He displayed them to\nthe world to let the disputers know of them, and the disputers of the\nworld enjoyed them with him.\n\n\nIt is unclear whether the order of the sequence is deliberate, but\nthis seems unlikely, since the temporal paradoxes are not placed\ntogether, and it is hard to see how thesis 8, about the rings, fits\ninto a deliberate, argumentative sequence. On the other hand, the last\nthesis, the only one with ethical import, reads like a grand\nconclusion and so probably belongs in the final position. The first\nforms a natural opening, with the \u201cGreat One\u201d portending\nthe \u201cone unit\u201d of the tenth, and the second may about one\nof the notions introduced in the first, the \u201cSmall One\u201d or\ninfinitesimal. The fifth is among the clearest and is probably the\nbasis for several of the others. Some scholars have suggested that the\nlist breaks into two parts, with the fifth thesis summarizing the\nfirst half, but this interpretation seems forced. The first, fifth,\nand tenth are of course neither paradoxes nor sophistries, but\nrelatively straightforward philosophical theses. Thesis 3 is a variant\nof the first two paradoxes attributed to Hui Shi and Deng Xi in\nXunzi (3.1), listed above in the section on\n Deng Xi.\n With those two exceptions, the paradoxes attributed to Hui Shi here\nare considerably more interesting philosophically than those Xunzi\nmentions. \n\nThe theses are obscure enough that, especially without knowing Hui\nShi\u2019s original arguments, any close interpretation must be\npartly speculative. Different readers are bound to arrive at different\nconclusions. With the possible exception of theses 1, 5, and 10, there\nis simply not enough contextual information to offer an authoritative\nargument for any interpretation, though at least some readings can be\nruled out for failing to cohere with any recognized issues or theories\nin early Chinese philosophical discourse. Here we will offer a\ntentative explanation of each thesis grounded in the philosophical\ncontext sketched in\n \u201cBackground and Overview\u201d\n above.[11] The theses divide fairly naturally\ninto four groups, which we will discuss one by one.\nGroup 1: Basic Principles\n\nThe first group comprises theses 1, 5, and 10, which state\nphilosophical doctrines about ontology and ethics, not paradoxes, and\nwhich are relatively easy to understand. All three deal with the\nplurality of possible ways to distinguish things, either as \u201cthe\nsame\u201d or \u201cdifferent\u201d or as parts of a whole, ranging\nfrom the smallest possible part\u2014the infinitesimal\u2014to the\nlargest possible whole, the \u201cGreat One,\u201d which includes\neverything in the cosmos. How we distinguish things is relative to the\nscale or perspective we adopt. Thesis 5 is slightly obscure, but it\nseems to describe the relative or perspectival nature of relations of\nsimilarity and difference. Two things can be the same on a large\nscale, or in some general respect, while at the same time being\ndifferent on a smaller scale, or in some more specific respect. For\nexample, two animals can be the same in being of the kind\nhorse, yet be different in color. Anything can be similar or\ndifferent on some scale or other. If we distinguish finely, every\nindividual horse is different, while if we distinguish coarsely,\nhorses are no different from other animals, or even from all other\nthings. There seems to be an unlimited range of levels on which we can\ndistinguish relations of sameness and difference, including deeming\nevery individual different or the myriad kinds of things the same.\n\n\nBecause the same/different relation comprises both kind relations and\npart-whole relations, Thesis 5 can also be taken to include part-whole\nrelations. Deeming all things \u201cthe same\u201d is deeming them\nall parts of the same whole. Deeming them \u201cdifferent\u201d can\nbe understood as separating them off as individual parts of that\nwhole. To the extent that the other theses are based on relations of\nsameness versus difference and part versus whole, then, thesis 5 may\nexplain them all. \n\nThesis 1 is nearly self-explanatory. How we distinguish\nthings\u2014in this case, how we even count \u201c1\u201d\u2014is\nrelative to some standard of division. The thesis concerns summing and\ndividing. The whole cosmos can be summed into a whole to form the\nGreat One. Or it can be divided down to the smallest possible unit,\nthe Small One, probably a geometric point. \n\nThesis 10 presents an ethical principle tied together with an\nontological one, which presumably is meant to justify it. Since\neverything can be summed into a whole\u2014the Great One\u2014heaven\nand earth and the myriad things contained therein can be considered a\nsingle \u201cbody\u201d or\n \u201cunit.\u201d[12]\n (In classical texts, the expression \u2018heaven and earth\u2019\nrefers to the cosmos, including not only the sky and earth but the\nentire natural world.) The ethical principle follows intuitively. If\neverything is one unit, then any care (ai, also\n\u201clove\u201d) we have for ourselves should also be directed at\nall of the other myriad things (wu, \u201cthings,\u201d or,\nperhaps more specifically, \u201ccreatures\u201d), since\nfundamentally we are all parts of the same vast \u201cunit\u201d or\n\u201cbody.\u201d This ethical stance takes the ideal of\nimpartiality even farther than the Mohists. Their position is that we\nmust care inclusively for every person in the world. Thesis 10\nadvocates caring for every thing as well. \nGroup 2: Infinitesimals and Part-whole\n\nThe second group concerns infinitesimals and part-whole relations.\nLike all seven of the remaining theses, these are paradoxes. Thesis 2\nis fairly clear. Geometrical points are dimensionless. The sum of two\npoints is still a point; hence points cannot be added one to another\nto form an object with thickness or length. Yet anything with\ndimensions is somehow constituted by points and divisible into\n them.[13]\n\nIn this group we can also include thesis 8, though with much less\nconfidence, as it is the most obscure of the ten. We will tentatively\nsuppose\u2014following Harbsmeier (1998: 296) and Graham (1989:\n79)\u2014that this thesis too is based on infinitesimals. The paradox\nmight then be explained in one of two ways. First, if the linked rings\nare thought of as circles, formed by points on a plane, then they have\nno thickness. They appear linked when viewed from above, but on the\nsurface of the plane nothing blocks them from being pulled apart. The\nsecond explanation extends the same idea to three dimensions. If, as\nthesis 2 suggests, two three-dimensional rings are constituted by\ndimensionless points, then they can be pulled apart: since each point\ntakes up no space, there is nothing preventing the rings from passing\nthrough each other. These interpretations are highly speculative,\nhowever. Without further contextual information, even if this sort of\nexplanation makes sense of the paradox, we have no particular reason\nto believe it is correct. \nGroup 3: Spatial Relations\n\nThe third group are based on spatial relations, including comparisons\nof size. Thesis 3, the only one also attributed to Hui Shi in the\nXunzi, can be taken to illustrate the idea that things deemed\ndifferent on one scale can be deemed the same on another. By some\nperspective or standard, such as that of the infinitely vast Great\nOne, the difference between the height of the sky and the earth or\nmountains and marshes may be insignificant. From that perspective, the\ndifferences between mountains and marshes may be only what thesis 5\ncalls \u201cdifferences on a small scale,\u201d while the two count\nas \u201cthe same\u201d on a large scale. Thesis 6 is especially\nobscure. Thematically, we can point out that like several of the other\ntheses, it attempts to collapse a distinction, in this case between\nthe finite and infinite. As Hansen (1992: 262) points out, thesis 6,\nalong with 7 and 9, all focus on indexicals. Since the referents of\nindexicals shift from context to context, they are a vivid example of\nthe fluidity of the language-world relation and the distinction\nbetween \u201cthis\u201d (shi) and \u201cnot\u201d\n(fei). This suggests at least two ways to understand the\nthesis, both too speculative to be considered justified, but perhaps\nat least roughly indicative of its point. One is that if a particular\ndirection is to be south, it must have a limit, or else the\nfour directions all merge into one and south is no longer south, since\nit is not distinguished from the other three. Another possibility is\nthat since the directions of the compass are all indexical, relative\nto our point of reference, south always has a limit: the point at\nwhich we stand. \n\nThesis 9 is another of those involving indexicals, in this case\n\u201ccenter,\u201d and is also very obscure. The thesis claims that\nthe center of the world is north of the northernmost state and south\nof the southernmost. Possibly the thesis is a variant of thesis 3,\nthat the sky is as low as the earth. The point there was that from the\nperspective of the infinitely vast whole, the difference between the\nheight of the sky and earth may be insignificant. Thesis 9 could be\nmaking the analogous point that the distance between Yan and Yue is\ninsignificant. Another possibility is that if space is infinitely\nlarge, then every standpoint can count as the center (Graham 1989: 79,\nafter the 3rd-century Sima Biao). Possibly this thesis is a variant of\nthe same idea as the third thesis in the Xunzi list, which\nwas that the far west and far east are \u201cadjacent.\u201d \nGroup 4: Temporal Relations\n\nThe fourth group deal with temporal relations. Thesis 4 is paradoxical\nbut easily intelligible. Just as from one perspective the sun is at\nits highest, from another perspective it is beginning to set. Just as\nthings are living and growing, they are also coming closer to death.\nAgain, the plurality of perspectives threatens to collapse the\ndistinction between two apparent opposites, living and dying. In\ncomparison with thesis 4, thesis 7 is extremely obscure. Clearly, it\nattempts to collapse the difference between today and yesterday or\npresent and past. Interestingly, this paradox combines spatial and\ntemporal relations, since in addition to the distinction between today\nand yesterday, there is the spatial movement from here to Yue (a state\nin the south). Hence Harbsmeier (298) and Graham (79) both propose to\ninterpret the paradox in terms of the infinite divisibility of space\nand time, suggesting that if I cross the border into Yue precisely at\nthe instant when today turns into tomorrow, the result is that I am\nsimultaneously leaving one state today and arriving in the other\ntomorrow. Another possibility is to point out that xi, the\nword rendered \u201cyesterday,\u201d is also commonly used to mean\nsimply \u201cthe past\u201d or \u201cpreviously.\u201d So thesis 7\ncan be restated, \u201cToday I go to Yue, but I arrive in the\npast.\u201d The import of the paradox could be that all\n\u201carriving\u201d is always in the past: whenever we arrive\nsomewhere, our journey is completed, or \u201cpast.\u201d \nGeneral Theme\n\nAre the ten theses merely a loose collection, or are they intended to\nsupport a particular conclusion? Clearly, several of them can be taken\nto follow from thesis 5, about the relativity of sameness and\ndifference. Thesis 5 can thus be treated as a premise or guiding\nprinciple and might be the main theme. Another possibility is that the\nten are intended to culminate in the final thesis, the only one with\nmoral import, which is not relativistic. It states that heaven and\nearth\u2014all of the natural world\u2014form a monistic unit, and\nso our moral caring should extend to all things. The question of the\noverall significance of the set in effect boils down to the question\nof whether, given the overall context, thesis 10 has a privileged\nstatus over thesis 5 and the others. From Hu Shih (1922) on, many\ninterpreters have suggested it\n does.[14]\n Clearly, the textual evidence is so sparse that there is no question\nof deciding the issue conclusively. However, there are at least three\ngood reasons for favoring the monistic interpretation. First, the\nplacement of thesis 10 at the end makes it natural to read it as the\nconclusion or main theme. Second, not only is thesis 10 placed last,\nit is the only thesis with ethical significance. A plausible\nexplanation is that whoever arranged the ten theses saw the ethical\nview as emerging out of the others. Third, and most important, unlike\ntheses 1 and 5, thesis 10 seems to make an absolutist claim. If it\nwere parallel to theses 1 and 5, we might expect it to present a\nperspectival claim, such as that heaven and earth are in one respect\none body and in another respect many. But instead it simply asserts\nthat they are one.\n\nTentatively adopting the monistic interpretation, then, we can\nreconstruct the basic \u201cHui Shi view\u201d roughly as\nfollows:\n\nThe relations of sameness and difference that underlie all use of\nlanguage can be redrawn in indefinitely many ways, all of which may be\njustified relative to one standard or another. \nSo no single way of drawing distinctions is fixed by nature\nitself.\nHence the world in itself draws no distinctions at all.\nDistinctions are established by human convention, in which we\nestablish norms for distinguishing the same and different one way or\nanother. Apart from these norms, there are no absolute, privileged\nnatural kinds or distinctions. \nTherefore, in itself, all of nature forms a single whole. (And as\nparts of this whole, we should care for all things.)\n\n\nSeveral comments about this view are in order. First, the thrust of\nthe view is not that distinctions are \u201cunreal,\u201d in the\nsense of being illusory, false, or merely an aspect of appearance, not\nunderlying reality. It is just the opposite: countless different\nschemes of distinctions are all real, with the result that\nnone are privileged. Since no scheme is privileged, the\n\u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cdefault\u201d view\u2014that of the\nworld in itself\u2014is monistic, drawing no distinctions at all. On\nthe other hand, another way of understanding \u201creal\u201d is as\nmeaning \u201cfixed by nature itself.\u201d If we take\n\u201creal\u201d this way, we can agree with Hansen (262) that the\nHui Shi position adopts a \u201cnon-realist\u201d attitude toward\ndistinctions: it holds that no single scheme of distinctions is fixed\nby the world. However, if the monistic interpretation is correct, then\nthe Hui Shi position is realist in this sense with respect to\nthe \u201cone unit\u201d or \u201cGreat One,\u201d the \u201cnull\nscheme\u201d consisting of the absence of any distinctions. That\nscheme is fixed by nature itself. \n\nSecond, the Hui Shi view does not hold that, as Graham proposes,\n\u201cSince division leads to contradiction don\u2019t divide at\nall\u201d (1989: 79). Far from regarding contradictions as a problem,\nit embraces them. It explains them by appeal to constantly shifting\nperspectives or standards for distinguishing same and different. \n\nSince Hui Shi\u2019s monism might recall that of the Eleatics (cf. Hu\n1922, Graham 1989), it is worth clarifying the similarities and\ndifferences between the two. The similarities are superficial: both\ndevelop a form of absolute monism grounded in reflection about\nlanguage or thought and its relation to reality. But the arguments for\nand consequences of the two views are fundamentally different. The\nstarting point for Parmenides\u2019s monism is reflection on the\nconcept of \u2018being\u2019 or \u2018the real\u2019, specifically\nthe claim that what is real must necessarily be. From this he draws\nthe conclusion that what is real must be ungenerable, imperishable,\nindivisible, and unchanging. Thus, in contrast to the eternal,\nunchanging world intelligible through reason, the inconstant, changing\nworld of everyday perceptual experience is in some sense not\n\u201creal.\u201d By contrast, the Hui Shi view starts from a kind\nof radical perspectivalism about distinctions. It argues that since no\nstandard for drawing distinctions has a privileged, absolute status,\nthe only way to draw distinctions given by reality itself is not to\ndraw any at all. Reality is not regarded as indivisible and\nunchanging, nor is the changing world of sense experience in any sense\n\u201cunreal.\u201d Rather, reality is divisible in indefinitely\nmany ways. All of the resulting distinctions are \u201creal\u201d in\nthe sense that the features of things on which they are based indeed\nexist. The distinctions are not delusory. The problem is that neither\nare they privileged or fixed: they can be replaced by alternative\nschemes of distinctions. The only privileged scheme is monism, drawing\nno distinctions at\n all.[15]\n\nIs this move from perspectivalism about distinctions to a kind of\nmonism justified? Hansen argues that it is not. His interpretation of\nthe argument is that it moves from the claim that we cannot know what\ndistinctions are ultimately real to the conclusion that no\ndistinctions are real (262). The move is via the hidden,\nverificationist premise that a distinction exists only if we can know\nthat it does. Hence Hansen suggests that the Hui Shi view is based on\na form of \u201cverification fallacy,\u201d which confuses what we\ncan know with what is real (263). \n\nHansen is probably right to hold that monism does not follow validly\nfrom Hui Shi\u2019s premises. All that follows is that no one scheme\nfor drawing distinctions can be justified absolutely: Justification\nmust always be contextual. But it seems unlikely that the text commits\nthe fallacy he describes. The ten theses do not mention epistemic\nissues. Certainly there is no explicit skeptical claim that we cannot\nknow which distinctions are ultimately real. Rather, there is only the\nsuggestion, in thesis 5, that there may be uncountably many ways of\ndrawing distinctions, set alongside a series of examples that collapse\nconventional distinctions. So, rather than committing a\nverificationist fallacy, it may be that the Hui Shi view is simply\ninconsistent. On the basis of thesis 5, Hui Shi should hold any scheme\nof distinctions may be deemed \u201cadmissible\u201d or\n\u201cinadmissible,\u201d by reference to some standard or other,\nyet no scheme is privileged, including the scheme that\nconsists in drawing no distinctions at all. Instead, if the monistic\ninterpretation is correct, he mistakenly takes the \u201cGreat\nOne\u201d or \u201cone unit\u201d view to be an exception to this\n rule.[16]\n The mistake is understandable, since drawing no distinctions at all\nmight seem to be a way of circumventing the perspectival nature of\ndistinctions. It is not, however, since strictly speaking it remains\none among other ways of drawing distinctions. \n\n\u201cUnder Heaven\u201d lists 21 more paradoxes, which \u201cthe\ndisputers used to respond to Hui Shi without end for their whole\nlives.\u201d All lack explanations, making some impenetrably obscure.\nFor interpretations of a handful of the relatively tractable ones,\nalong with speculations about a few of the others, see the following\nsupplementary document: \n\nMiscellaneous Paradoxes\n\n\nDespite their obscurity, at least some of the theses attributed to Hui\nShi and a few of the other paradoxes and sophistries collected in\n\u201cUnder Heaven\u201d probably grow out of legitimate theoretical\nissues and are of genuine philosophical interest. By contrast, when we\nturn to Gongsun Long, we encounter a disputer who may have been\ndevoted to sophistry purely for sophistry\u2019s sake. We cannot be\nsure of this, of course, but what we can say is that Gongsun Long won\nfame by advocating a claim that any competent speaker of his language\nwould have judged obviously false, namely that \u201ca white horse is\nnot a horse.\u201d \n6. Gongsun Long\n\nGongsun Long (c. 320\u2013250 B.C.E.) was a retainer to the Lord of\nPingyuan (d. 252 B.C.E.) in the northern state of Zhao. Anecdotes\nabout him are found in the Zhuangzi and The Annals of\nL\u00fc Buwei, in which he is depicted advising King Hui of Zhao\n(r. 298\u2013266 B.C.E.) against war (18.1, 18.7) and in disputation\nwith Kong Chuan, a descendent of Confucius, at the home of the Lord of\nPingyuan (18.5). He is mentioned in \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d as a\nleading disputer and in the Han dynasty Records of the Grand\nHistorian (Book 74) as undertaking disputation about the hard and\nwhite and the same and different. Intriguingly, the Annals\ndepicts him citing the Mohist principle of \u201call-inclusive\ncare\u201d (jian ai) to King Hui. Together with his anti-war\nstance, this suggests that he was influenced by and may once have\nnumbered among the Mohists. The Xunzi does not criticize him\nby name but does cite a version of his white horse sophism in a list\nof incorrect uses of names (22.3). \n\nIn one anecdote, Gongsun Long is shown applying his cleverness to help\nrescue a state from attack. Zhao, his state, had formed a treaty with\nQin to assist each other in anything either wished to do. Qin\nproceeded to attack Wei, Zhao\u2019s neighbor. Zhao wished to rescue\nWei, but Qin sent an envoy to the king of Zhao to complain. \n\nThe King of Qin was displeased and sent an envoy to reproach the King\nof Zhao, saying, \u201cThe treaty says, \u2018Whatever Qin wishes to\ndo, Zhao will assist it; whatever Zhao wishes to do, Qin will assist\nit.\u2019 Now Qin wishes to attack Wei, yet Zhao wishes to rescue it.\nThis is not what we agreed on.\u201d The King of Zhao told the Lord\nof Pingyuan about it. The Lord of Pingyuan told Gongsun Long about it.\nGongsun Long said, \u201cWe too can dispatch an envoy to reproach the\nKing of Qin, saying, \u2018Zhao wishes to rescue Wei, but now the\nKing of Qin alone does not assist Zhao. This is not what we agreed\non.\u2019\u201d (The Annals of L\u00fc Buwei, 18.5/457)\n\n\nAnother anecdote is valuable for what it suggests about the nature of\nGongsun Long\u2019s disputations. Gongsun Long debates with an\nopponent, Kong Chuan, at the residence of the Lord of Pingyuan. With\ngreat cleverness, he argues for the claim that \u201cJohn Doe has\nthree ears.\u201d (In Chinese, plurals are unmarked, so the sophist\ncan assert of any normal two-eared person, such as John Doe, that he\n\u201chas ear(s),\u201d and also that he has a left ear and a right\near. Therefore he has \u201cthree ears.\u201d) Eventually, Kong\nChuan is unable to reply. \n\nThe next day, Kong Chuan came to court. The Lord of Pingyuan said to\nhim, \u201cYesterday, Gongsun Long\u2019s speech was extremely\nclever.\u201d Kong Chuan said, \u201cThat\u2019s so. He was nearly\nable to make John Doe have three ears. Although he could do so,\nit\u2019s a difficult claim to accept. May I ask a question of you,\nyour Lordship? Claiming that John Doe has three ears is extremely\ndifficult and in reality is wrong. Claiming that John Doe has two ears\nis extremely easy and in reality is right. I wonder whether your\nLordship will follow what is easy and right, or what is difficult and\nwrong?\u201d (Annals, 18.5/457)\n\n\nGongsun Long\u2019s disputation is perceived as plainly not fitting\n\u201creality\u201d (shi, also the \u201cstuff\u201d\nspoken of). It is an exercise in cleverness, a kind of trick\nperformance in which the disputer attempts to make a case for a claim\nthat everyone knows does not fit its object. Harbsmeier has rightly\nemphasized this point in arguing that further attention to Gongsun\nLong\u2019s social and historical context is needed if we are to\nunderstand the white horse sophism properly (1998: 300\u2013301). He\nsuggests that Gongsun Long probably belonged to a class of\nentertainers at Chinese courts who performed various skills or tricks.\nHis was to prove, over any and all objections, that a white horse is\nnot a horse. His sophistries may have been intended primarily as a\nkind of light entertainment, not as expressions of a principled\nphilosophical position. They touch on philosophical issues, such as\ndiscriminating the same and different, but there is no reason to\nexpect them to demonstrate cogent reasoning based on a coherent\nsemantic or logical theory. The truth may be just the opposite: They\ncould have been intended to be whimsical and amusing, even comical.\nThe \u201cWhite Horse\u201d dialogue may be a record of the sort of\narguments Gongsun Long would offer in his performances. \n\nThe Han History lists Gongsun Long as the author of fourteen\nscrolls of writings. The extant text called Gongsun Longzi\ncomprises only five short dialogues and an introduction, which is\nobviously of relatively late date. A. C. Graham argued persuasively\nthat three of the dialogues are not Warring States texts, but much\nlater forgeries pieced together partly from misunderstood bits of the\nMohist Dialectics. Probably only the \u201cWhite\nHorse,\u201d the essay \u201cIndicating Things,\u201d and a bit of\nanother dialogue are genuine pre-Han\n texts.[17]\n We will look at the first of these below (the second is treated in a\nsupplement at the end of this section). \n\nThe Gongsun Longzi has inspired a vast exegetical literature\nin both Asian and European languages, with no consensus in sight as to\nthe significance and theoretical basis of its arguments. The\ninterpretation proposed here must be considered only one of several\npotentially defensible approaches (others are noted below). In the\ncase of the \u201cWhite Horse\u201d dialogue, the text is generally\nclear enough. (\u201cIndicating Things,\u201d on the other hand,\nappears to be intentionally obscure.) The scholarly controversy\nconcerns what theory and implicit premises to ascribe to the text so\nthat the arguments come out as cogent defenses of a reasonable\nposition. As Graham says, the interpretive obstacle is \u201cthe\ndifficulty of finding an angle of approach from which the arguments\nwill make sense.\u2026The arguments are clear, yet the first seems\nan obvious non sequitur\u2026and the rest seem to assume an\nelementary confusion of identity and class membership\u201d (1989:\n82). Introducing his own interpretation, he says, \u201cNo one has\nyet proposed a reading of the dialogue as a consecutive demonstration\nwhich does not turn it into an improbable medley of gross fallacies\nand logical subtleties\u201d (1990: 193). Building on\nHarbsmeier\u2019s insight that the historical context of Gongsun\nLong\u2019s disputations has been insufficiently appreciated, we may\nsuspect Graham\u2019s remarks signal interpretive charity gone too\nfar. Given what information we have about Gongsun\nLong\u2014Harbsmeier\u2019s considerations, the general reputation\nof the disputers for flippant wordplay, the denunciation of Gongsun\nLong in the \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d essay, and most important, the\nfact that his contemporaries took his most famous claim to be patently\nfalse\u2014we should expect the text to be a \u201cmedley\nof gross fallacies and logical subtleties,\u201d roughly a Chinese\nanalogue to the subtle, fallacious, and deeply amusing arguments of\nLewis Carroll. \n\nNone of this means that interpreting \u201cWhite Horse\u201d is\npointless. We can learn about the serious practice of disputation by\nstudying what is in effect a spoof of disputation, just as an\nanthropologist can learn about a culture by studying its humor. But we\nshould not expect the Gongsun Longzi to present rigorous\narguments or defend well-developed theses of philosophical substance.\nIn this case, interpretive charity may direct us to look not for true\nclaims supported by sound reasoning, but for whimsical claims defended\nby bewildering, even madcap arguments. \n6.1 \u201cWhite Horse is Not Horse\u201d\n\nThe \u201cWhite Horse Discourse\u201d has spawned nearly as many\ninterpretations as there are interpreters. One early, influential\ninterpretation took its theme to be denying the identity of the\nuniversals \u2018horse\u2019 and \u2018white horse\u2019 (Fung\n1958, Cheng 1983). There is now a fairly broad consensus, at least\namong European and American scholars, that the text is unlikely to\nconcern universals, since no ancient Chinese philosopher held a\nrealist doctrine of universals. Other interpretations have taken it to\ndeal with kind and identity relations (Cikoski 1975, Harbsmeier 1998),\npart-whole relations (Hansen 1983, Graham 1989), how the extensions of\nphrases vary from those of their constituent terms (Hansen 1992), and\neven the use/mention distinction (Thompson 1995). For examples of\nother recent approaches, see Indraccolo (2017), Fung (2020b), Jiang\n(2020), and Zhou (2020).\n\nA satisfactory interpretation must fit into the discursive context\nestablished by the Mohists, Xunzi, and The Annals of L\u00fc\nBuwei, cohere with the concerns we identified in discussing the\nbackground\n (Section 1)\n and main themes\n (Section 2)\n of the disputers\u2019 inquiries, and take into account what other\nearly texts tell us about Gongsun Long. Since we know he was an\nintellectual prankster, we cannot assume the texts will present cogent\narguments for a well-reasoned philosophical position. If we find them\npresenting plainly intelligible but specious arguments, we should take\nthese at face value, rather than seek esoteric explanations. Given the\ncontext of pre-Han thought, we should expect the text to toy with the\nproblem of distinguishing \u201csame\u201d from\n\u201cdifferent,\u201d potentially touching on identity, part-whole,\nand kind relations. And given the disputers\u2019 association with\nthe theme of \u201chard and white,\u201d we should expect that the\ntext might attempt to treat inseparable features of things as if they\nwere separable parts. A number of interpretations have the potential\nto meet these requirements, including interpretations involving\npart-whole relations, scope ambiguity, kind relations, and identity\nrelations. To decide between them, then, we need to look at the\ndetails of the text. \u201cWhite Horse\u201d contains five arguments\nfor its thesis that \u201cWhite horse is not horse.\u201d We may\nfind that some interpretive approaches work better for some of the\nfive, some for others. \n\nOne further anecdote about Gongsun Long\u2014found in two texts from\nlater eras, the introductory chapter of the Gongsun Longzi\nand the Kong Congzi\u2014provides useful context for the\ndialogue. In response to a request from Kong Chuan that he abandon his\nthesis that a white horse is not a horse, Gongsun Long defends it by\nclaiming that Confucius himself accepted the same thesis. He cites a\nversion of a story also found in the The Annals of L\u00fc\nBuwei (1.4), in which the King of Chu loses his bow.\n\nThe King\u2019s attendants asked to look for it, but the King said,\n\u201cStop. The King of Chu lost a bow. A Chu person will find it.\nWhy bother to look for it?\u201d Confucius heard about it and said:\n\u201cThe King of Chu is benevolent and righteous but hasn\u2019t\nyet reached the ultimate. He should simply have said, \u2018A person\nlost a bow, a person will find it,\u2019 that\u2019s all. Why must\nit be \u2018Chu\u2019?\u201d In this way, Confucius took Chu people\nto be different from what\u2019s called \u201cpeople.\u201d Now to\napprove of Confucius\u2019s taking Chu people to be different from\nwhat\u2019s called \u201cpeople\u201d but disapprove of my taking\nwhite horse to be different from what\u2019s called\n\u201chorse\u201d is contradictory. (Gongsun Longzi, Book\n 1)[18]\n\n\nIn one version of the story, Kong Chuan replies that when Confucius\nomits the \u2018Chu\u2019, he is broadening the scope of the\nreferent, not claiming that Chu people are not people. \n\nWhenever we say \u201cperson,\u201d we refer to persons in general,\njust as whenever we say \u201chorse,\u201d we refer to horses in\ngeneral. \u2018Chu\u2019 by itself is the state; \u2018white\u2019\nby itself is the color. Wishing to broaden the referent of\n\u2018person\u2019, it\u2019s appropriate to omit the\n\u2018Chu\u2019; wishing to fix the name of the color, it\u2019s\nnot appropriate to omit the \u2018white\u2019. (Kong\nCongzi, Book 11; cf. Graham 1989: 84)\n\n\nAs Harbsmeier points out (302), since this story appears in the\nintroduction to the Gongsun Longzi, it suggests that the\nbook\u2019s ancient editors themselves took the theme to be how the\nscope of the extension of a noun such as \u2018person\u2019 or\n\u2018horse\u2019 varies when modified by an adjective such as\n\u2018Chu\u2019 or \u2018white\u2019. The main theme is unlikely\nto be part-whole relations, since it is unlikely that the noun phrase\n\u2018Chu person\u2019 was construed as referring to a whole\ncomprising two parts, the state of Chu and a person. \n\nThis preparatory discussion in hand, let\u2019s look at the arguments\nin the \u201cWhite Horse Discourse.\u201d The text consists of a\nseries of exchanges between a sophist and an objector, who defends the\ncommonsense view that white horses are horses. For brevity, we will\ntranslate and discuss only the sophist\u2019s arguments, not the\nobjector\u2019s. To capture the flavor of the Chinese, we will render\ncertain phrases in pidgin English, omitting articles and plurals. So\nwe will translate the main thesis as \u201cWhite horse is not\nhorse,\u201d variously interpretable as \u201ca white horse is not a\nhorse,\u201d \u201cwhite horses are not horses,\u201d \u201ca\nwhite horse is not an exemplar of the kind horse,\u201d or\n\u201cthe kind white horse is not identical with the kind\n horse.\u201d[19]\n\n\nArgument 1.\n\n\u2018Horse\u2019 is that by which we name the shape.\n\u2018White\u2019 is that by which we name the color. Naming the\ncolor is not naming the shape. So white horse is not horse.\n\n\nAt first glance, it is not at all clear how the premises are expected\nto support the conclusion. Here we should recall that the argument is\nprobably intended to be perplexing and open to various\ninterpretations, the better to confuse and mystify the audience. With\nthis caveat in mind, one plausible reading is that \u2018white\nhorse\u2019 names both the color and the shape of white horses, not\nonly the shape. So \u2018white horse\u2019 names something different\nfrom what \u2018horse\u2019 names. Hence white horse, the extension\nof \u2018white horse\u2019, is not the same as (identical to) horse,\nthe extension of \u2018horse\u2019.\n\nThis argument can also be understood as \u201cseparating hard and\nwhite,\u201d in that the shape and color of white horses, which are\nin fact inseparable, are treated as two separate things. If we grant\nthe sophist that naming the color isn\u2019t naming the shape, we\nhave already allowed him to separate shape from color. Referring to\nthe color is of course different from referring to the shape. But\nnaming the object with the color is just naming the object with the\nshape. Hence we should reject the third premise and insist that naming\nthe color is naming the\n shape.[20]\n\nArgument 2.\n\nIf someone seeks a horse, then it\u2019s admissible to deliver a\nbrown or a black horse. If someone seeks a white horse, then\nit\u2019s inadmissible to deliver a brown or a black horse. Suppose\nwhite horse were indeed horse. In that case, what the person seeks in\nthose two cases would be one and the same. What he seeks being one and\nthe same is the white one not being different from horse. If what he\nseeks is not different, then how is it that the brown or black horse\nare in the one case admissible and in the other inadmissible?\nAdmissible and inadmissible, that they contradict each other is clear.\nSo brown and black horses are one and the same in being able to answer\nto \u201chaving horse\u201d but not to \u201chaving white\nhorse.\u201d This confirms that white horse is not horse.\n\n\nThis argument is fairly clearly not about part-whole relations, nor\nabout separating hard from white. The sophist plainly construes\n\u201cwhite horse is horse\u201d as \u201cwhite horse is identical\nto horse.\u201d In Chinese as in English, the sentence \u2018White\nhorses are horses\u2019 can be interpreted as predicating\n\u2018horse\u2019 of white horses, making the true claim that the\nthings picked out by \u2018white horse\u2019 are all among those\npicked out by \u2018horse\u2019, or it can be interpreted as\nexpressing an identity, making the false claim that exactly the same\nthings are picked out by \u2018white horse\u2019 as by\n\u2018horse\u2019. The argument trades on this ambiguity. Because we\nknow that modifying a noun narrows the scope of its extension, when we\nhear \u201cwhite horses are horses,\u201d we naturally apply the\nprinciple of charity, assume the speaker is not saying something\nobviously false, and take the relation in question to be predication,\nnot identity. But the sophist insists on interpreting the sentence as\nan identity. Notice that the sophist implicitly applies a principle\nroughly like Leibniz\u2019s law of indiscernibility of identicals. He\nassumes that if two things are identical, they will share all their\nfeatures, and one can be substituted for the other in any context.\nSince what can be \u201cdelivered\u201d in answer to a request for\n\u201cwhite horse\u201d is different from what can be\n\u201cdelivered\u201d for \u201chorse,\u201d white horse is not\n horse.[21]\n\nArgument 3.\n\nHorses indeed have color; thus there are white horses. Supposing\nhorses had no color, and there were simply horses and that\u2019s\nall, how could we pick out the white horses? So white is not horse.\nWhite horse is horse combined with white. Is horse combined with white\nthe same as\n horse?[22]\n So I say: White horse is not horse.\n\n\n\u201cWhite\u201d is not \u201chorse\u201d because\n\u2018horse\u2019 alone doesn\u2019t pick out the white ones; only\n\u2018white\u2019 does. The sophist takes it as obvious that\n\u201chorse\u201d combined with \u201cwhite\u201d is not simply\n\u201chorse.\u201d Here he is \u201cseparating hard and\nwhite,\u201d in that he explicitly treats \u201cwhite\u201d and\n\u201chorse\u201d (that is, the shape of the animal) as two things\nthat are combined to form something more than, and different from, a\nhorse. The argument again turns on construing \u201cWhite horse is\nhorse\u201d as the claim that the kind white horse is\nidentical to the kind horse.\n\nArgument 4.\n\n\u201cSince you take having white horse to be having horse, we can\nsay having horse is having brown horse, is that admissible?\u201d\n\u201cNot admissible.\u201d \u201cTaking having horse to be\ndifferent from having brown horse, this is taking brown horse to be\ndifferent from horse. Taking brown horse to be different from horse,\nthis is taking brown horse to be not horse. Taking brown horse to be\nnot horse while taking white horse to be having horse, this is flying\nthings entering a pond, inner and outer coffins in different places.\nThese are the most contradictory sayings and confused expressions in\nthe world.\u201d\n\n\nHere again the argument is based on construing \u201cWhite/brown\nhorse is horse\u201d as an identity claim. Recall that in early\nChinese thought the same/different relation may refer to either\nidentity or kind relations. Moreover, in classical Chinese, both types\nof relations are expressed in the same syntactic form, the Chinese\nanalogue of \u2018A is (not) B\u2019. So when the\ncontext is unambiguous, it is perfectly legitimate to express the fact\nthat A is different from B by saying\n\u201cA is not B.\u201d Taking advantage of this\ngrammatical feature, the sophist can move legitimately from the\nuncontroversial claim that having a horse is different from (that is,\nnot identical to) having a brown horse to the intermediate claim that\nbrown horse is different from (not identical to) horse and then not so\nlegitimately to the conclusion that brown horse is not horse. The\nconclusion indeed follows, but only if we allow the sophist to\nconstrue \u201cis not\u201d as \u201cis not identical to.\u201d\nNotice that this argument seems to involve neither part-whole\nrelations nor separating hard from white (that is, shape from color).\nAnalogy plays a central role, however, as the argument is based on the\nanalogy between brown and white horses. \n\nThe rhetorical flourish at the end of the argument is typical of\nWarring States disputation. To emphasize that a claim is inconsistent\nor contradictory, disputers would habitually cite contradictory or\nimpossible things as analogies (Leslie 1964). \n\nArgument 5.\n\n\u201cWhite\u201d does not fix what is white.\u2026 As to\n\u201cwhite horse,\u201d saying it fixes what is white. What fixes\nwhat is white is not white. \u201cHorse\u201d selects or excludes\nnone of the colors, so brown or black horses can all answer.\n\u201cWhite horse\u201d selects some color and excludes others;\nbrown and black horses are all excluded on the basis of color, and so\nonly white horse alone can answer. Excluding none is not excluding\nsome. Therefore white horse is not horse.\n\n\nThe sophist first \u201cseparates hard and white,\u201d establishing\nthat the shape \u201chorse\u201d is not the same thing as the color\n\u201cwhite.\u201d The color alone does not specify the location\nthat is white; saying \u201cwhite horse\u201d does. Therefore horse,\nthe shape, is not white, the color. Indeed, horse specifies no color\nat all. White horse, on the other hand, does specify a color. So again\nthe sophist has shown that white horse and horse have distinct\nfeatures. Thus white horse is not (identical to) horse. \n\nTo sum up, the most natural way to read the text is as repeatedly\nequivocating between a statement of identity and one that predicates a\nmore general term of the objects denoted by a less general term. The\nsophist refuses to distinguish the true statement that \u201c[the\nkind] white horse is not [identical to the kind] horse\u201d from the\nfalse \u201cwhite horse is not [of the kind] horse.\u201d The\nnatural way to interpret \u201cWhite horse is horse\u201d is as the\nlatter, but the sophist insists on interpreting it as the former. In a\nfew places, the sophist distinguishes the shape of the horse from the\ncolor in a way that probably corresponds to \u201cseparating hard and\nwhite.\u201d \n\nA related explanation of the sophist\u2019s view is that he confuses\nterms that refer at different levels of generality, or, equivalently,\nsimply refuses to recognize that terms can refer at different levels\nof generality. Xunzi, whose career largely overlapped with Gongsun\nLong\u2019s, introduced the concept of a \u201ccommon name\u201d\n(gong ming), or general term, which may refer to things at\ndifferent levels of generality (22.2f). Xunzi pointed out that\nsometimes we refer to things by a single name, such as\n\u2018horse\u2019, and sometimes, to communicate more precisely, we\nuse a \u201ccompound\u201d name (what we would think of as a noun\nphrase), such as \u2018white horse\u2019. Provided one of these two\nkinds of names is more general, we can use both without their\ninterfering with each other. This is roughly the same point Kong Chuan\nmade in insisting that \u2018horse\u2019 always refers to all horses\nand that adding \u2018white\u2019 to it merely narrows its reference\nby specifying the horses\u2019 color. In each case, the animals\ndenoted by \u2018horse\u2019 are still horses. \u201cWhite\nHorse\u201d deliberately ignores this point. \n\nHansen (1983, 1992) has proposed an interesting account of the\nphilosophical significance of the \u201cWhite Horse\u201d dialogue.\nThe simplest early Chinese model of the language-world relation was\n\u201cone name, one thing,\u201d according to which all names refer\nat the same level of generality. Given the Chinese concern with\n\u201ccorrecting names,\u201d so that communication can proceed\neffectively and language can guide action reliably, a natural view\nwould be that ideally each name or phrase should consistently denote\none and only one sort of thing. But as the Mohists noticed, when names\nare joined to form phrases, their reference may shift in unexpected\nways. In Chinese, the phrases \u2018oxen-and-horses\u2019 (niu\nma) and \u2018white horse\u2019 (bai ma) appear to\nhave the same syntax. But in compounds of the first type, the\nextension of the component nouns remains exactly the same as when the\nnouns are used singly: the extension of \u2018oxen-and-horses\u2019\nis simply the sum of the extensions of \u2018oxen\u2019 and\n\u2018horses\u2019. In compounds of the second type\u2014the\n\u201cas hard to white\u201d type\u2014on the other hand, the\nextension of the component words changes. The extension of\n\u2018white horse\u2019 is the intersection, not the sum, of white\nthings and horses. The extension of the words \u2018white\u2019 and\n\u2018horse\u2019 as used in the compound is thus different from\nwhat it is when they are used alone. This raises a serious problem for\nthe one-name-one-thing view. The Mohists discovered the problem and\ntook steps toward a solution. Xunzi finally solved it by explicitly\nrejecting the one-name-one-thing principle and recognizing that terms\nrefer at different levels of generality. The approach implied by\n\u201cWhite Horse,\u201d Hansen suggests, would address the problem\nby retaining the one-name-one-thing principle and reforming our\nlanguage use, so that all names pick out exactly the same portion of\nreality in all contexts, whether used singly or compounded into\nphrases. Since the extension of names changes when they are combined\nto form compounds of the \u201cas hard to white\u201d type, a\nproponent of this view must insist that the objects denoted by such\ncompounds be treated as distinct from the objects denoted by either of\ntheir constituent names: white horses are neither white nor horse, but\na distinct sort of thing. This \u201csolution\u201d is absurd, of\ncourse. But moving beyond the one-name-one-thing model and explaining\nexactly why this is absurd was a legitimate philosophical\npuzzle at the\n time.[23]\n\nThe other complete, genuine essay attributed to Gongsun Long is the\nnear-impenetrable \u201cDiscourse on Indicating Things.\u201d For a\ndiscussion of this text, see the supplementary document:\n\nIndicating and Things\n\n7. A Daoist Critique\n\nAmong Warring States texts, only two show any familiarity with the\ndetails of Hui Shi\u2019s and Gongsun Long\u2019s theses. (The\n\u201cUnder Heaven\u201d book of the Zhuangzi, the major\nsource for our discussion of Hui Shi, dates probably from the first\nfew decades of the Han dynasty.) One is the Xunzi, which as\nwe saw ascribes a list of seven paradoxes to Hui Shi and Deng Xi, as\nwell as alluding elsewhere (22.3) to the white horse sophism. The\nother is the famous \u201cDiscourse on Equalizing Things,\u201d Book\n2 of the Zhuangzi, though the text does not attribute the\ntheses to Hui Shi or Gongsun Long by name. \u201cEqualizing\nThings\u201d is critical of the disputers\u2019 ideas and in one\npassage explicitly criticizes Hui\n Shi.[24]\n But it also praises his intelligence and is not downright hostile\ntoward him, as Xunzi is. \n\n\u201cEqualizing Things\u201d alludes to versions of at least four\nof Hui Shi\u2019s theses and to both the white horse and the\n\u201cindicating\u201d sophisms. \u201cToday go to Yue and arrive\nyesterday\u201d is cited as an analogy for something impossible or\ncontradictory. \u201cJust as it is alive, it is dying\u201d is used\nfor rhetorical effect to support the point that judgments of what is\n\u201cthis\u201d (shi) and \u201cnot this\u201d\n(fei) arise together, are relative to each other, and can be\nreversed or shifted. After arguing that anything can be deemed\n\u201cthis\u201d or \u201cnot this,\u201d the text critiques\nGongsun Long: \n\nUsing indicating to show that indicating is not indicating is not as\ngood as using not-indicating to show that to indicating is not\nindicating. Using a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not\nas good as using what is not a horse to show that a horse is not a\nhorse. Heaven and earth are one \u201cindicated\u201d; the myriad\nthings are one horse. (cf. Graham 1981: 53)\n\n\nInstead of using a white horse as an example to show that it\u2019s\npossible to treat some horses as not of the kind horse, it\nwould be simpler and clearer to use something of another kind, such as\nan ox, and show that some horses can be treated as \u201cthe\nsame\u201d as that thing and different from other horses. For\ninstance, draft horses could be deemed \u201cthe same\u201d as oxen,\ngrouped together with them as draft animals, and distinguished as\ndifferent from riding horses or racehorses. For that matter, anything\nand everything can be summed into a whole and deemed a single\n\u201cindicated\u201d or \u201chorse.\u201d The text\u2019s point\nis to trivialize Gongsun Long\u2019s theses. For some purpose or\nother, by some standard or other, white horse can indeed be considered\ndifferent from horse. But in light of the pragmatic stance adopted by\n\u201cEqualizing Things,\u201d there is nothing puzzling or\nremarkable about this. \n\nThese allusions place \u201cEqualizing Things\u201d firmly within\nthe intellectual milieu of the disputers. Indeed, the text argues\nexplicitly for a view closely related to one of their signature\nthemes\u2014\u201cdeeming so the not-so, admissible the\ninadmissible.\u201d \n\nAdmissible? Admissible. Inadmissible? Inadmissible. A dao\n(way) is formed by walking it, things are made so by calling them so.\nHow are they so? They are so in respects where they are so. How are\nthey not so? They are not so in respects where they are not so. Things\ninherently have respects in which they are so; things inherently have\nrespects in which they are admissible. No thing is not so; no thing is\nnot admissible. (cf. Graham 1981: 53)\n\n\nStill, the text\u2019s stance is fundamentally critical of Hui Shi\nand Gongsun Long. In a trenchant critique, the writer mocks several\nHui Shi-style theses, including spatial and temporal paradoxes and a\nversion of the \u201cone unit\u201d view: \n\n\u201cIn the world, nothing is bigger than the tip of an autumn hair,\nyet Mount Tai is small; nothing outlives a dead child, yet Pengzu [the\nChinese Methulesah] died young. Heaven and earth were born together\nwith me, and the myriad things and I are one.\u201d\n\n\nHaving already become one, can you still say anything? Having already\ncalled it \u201cone,\u201d can you succeed in not saying\nanything? One and the saying make two; two and the one make three.\nGoing on from here, even an expert calculator can\u2019t get to the\nend of it, much less an ordinary person! So in moving from nothing to\nsomething, we arrive at three; how much worse in moving from something\nto something! Better not to move any particular way at all, but simply\nadapt what we deem shi (right) to the particular situation.\n(cf. Graham 1981: 56)\n\n\nThe text questions the coherence of the \u201ceverything is\none\u201d view. To treat the myriad things and oneself as\n\u201cone\u201d is already to distinguish them from nothing, on the\none hand, and from what is not one, on the other. Indeed, the\nproponent of the \u201cone unit\u201d view cannot even state his\nposition consistently. Merely to say that everything is\n\u201cone\u201d is to recognize something else besides the one,\nnamely our statement pointing it out. The one and the name we give it\nor what we say about it already make two. And as soon as we notice\nthat we\u2019ve got two, we\u2019ve already got three\u2014the one,\nwhat we said about it, and the \u201ctwo\u201d comprising the one\nand what we said. The playful mockery has an underlying point. The\n\u201call is one\u201d view is not more \u201creal\u201d or more\njustified than other schemes of distinctions, and it is useless as a\nsolution to the problem of what scheme of distinctions to adopt in\nguiding life and action. It yields no normative guidance\u2014not\neven Hui Shi\u2019s \u201ccomprehensively care for all\nthings.\u201d Instead of attempting to find the\n\u201cabsolute\u201d or \u201creal\u201d scheme of action-guiding\ndistinctions, our energy would be better spent simply by guiding and\njustifying our actions contextually, responding to the needs of each\nparticular situation as it arises. \n\nLike Hui Shi, then, the writer of \u201cEqualizing Things\u201d\nagrees that distinctions can be drawn in indefinitely many ways. It is\nalso true that if no distinctions are drawn, things in themselves\n\u201cconnect into one.\u201d Yet focusing one\u2019s attention\neither on establishing some particular scheme of distinctions or on\nthe \u201cone\u201d shows an equal lack of insight.\nDisputation\u2014whether in defense of Confucian ritual, Mohist\ninclusive care, the Great One, or sophistical paradoxes\u2014is\nbeside the point. Issues addressed in disputation cannot and need not\nbe settled in order to live well. In fact, they may even interfere\nwith the conduct of a good life. When we perform activities at which\nwe genuinely excel\u2014those whose performance engenders the deeply\nsatisfying experience of feeling fully at home in the world\u2014what\nguides us is not knowledge of fixed, explicit standards of\nshi/fei, nor identification with the \u201cone.\u201d It is\na combination of skill and a kind of uncodifiable knack for adapting\nto the particular situation. \n\nSo in deeming things \u201cthis\u201d (shi), whether you\nbring up a stalk or a pillar, a hag or a beauty, the odd or bizarre,\nDao (the Way) connects them as one.\u2026Only one who has\narrived knows to connect things as one. Deeming things\n\u201cthis\u201d he does not use; instead he accommodates things in\nthe ordinary. He adapts his \u201cthis\u201d to the situation,\nthat\u2019s all. Adapting without knowing things are so is called\n\u201cDao.\u201d (cf. Graham 53)\n\n\nBy contrast, wearing out one\u2019s wits deliberately deeming things\none, as Hui Shi does, instead of simply seeing and making use of the\ninnumerable ways they can be taken to be the \u201csame,\u201d is\nlike forcefully affirming that seven equals four plus three without\nalso allowing that it equals three plus four (cf. Graham 54). It is a\nway of grasping part of the right view, but darkly, without insight.\n\n\nAs for Hui Shi, \u201cEqualizing Things\u201d concludes, \u201cHis\nknow-how almost reached the pinnacle, so his reputation carried on\nuntil later years. It was only in that he was good at it [disputation]\nthat he was different from other people. Because he was good at it, he\ndesired to clarify it. It was not the sort of thing that can be\nclarified, yet he tried to clarify it. Thus he spent his whole life in\nthe obscurity of hard and\n white.\u201d[25]\n",
