A third criticism of\neliminative materialism is that it ignores the remarkable success of\nfolk psychology, success that suggests it offers a more accurate\naccount of mental processes than eliminativists appreciate. Apart from\nthe strong intuitive evidence that seems to reveal beliefs and\ndesires, we also enjoy a great deal of success when we use common\nsense psychology to predict the actions of other people. Many have\nnoted that this high degree of success provides us with something like\nan inference-to-the-best-explanation argument in favor of common sense\npsychology and against eliminativism. The best explanation for the\nsuccess we enjoy in explaining and predicting human and animal\nbehavior is that folk psychology is roughly true, and that there\nreally are beliefs (Kitcher, 1984; Fodor, 1987; Lahav, 1992).\n\nA common eliminativist response to this argument is to re-emphasize a\nlesson from the philosophy of science; namely, that any\ntheory\u2014especially one that is as near and dear to us as folk\npsychology\u2014can often appear successful even when it completely\nmisrepresents reality. History demonstrates that we often discount\nanomalies, ignore failures as insignificant, and generally attribute\nmore success to a popular theory than it deserves. Like the proponents\nof vitalism or phlogiston theory, we may be blind to the failings of\nfolk psychology until an alternative account is in hand (P. M.\nChurchland, 1981; P. S. Churchland, 1986).\n\nWhile many defenders of folk psychology insist that folk psychology is\nexplanatorily strong, some defenders have gone in the opposite\ndirection, arguing that it is committed to far less than\neliminativists have typically assumed (Horgan, 1993; Horgan and\nGraham, 1991; Jackson and Pettit, 1990). According to these writers,\nfolk psychology, while indeed a theory, is a relatively\n\u201caustere\u201d (i.e., ontologically non-committal) theory, and\nrequires very little for vindication. Consequently, these authors\nconclude that when properly described, folk psychology can be seen as\ncompatible with a very wide range of neuroscientific or cognitive\ndevelopments, making eliminative materialism possible but\nunlikely.\n\nOf course, folk theories are like any theories in that they can be\npartly right and partly wrong. Even writers who are sympathetic to\neliminativism, such as John Bickle and Patricia Churchland (Bickle,\n1992; P.M. Churchland, 1994) point out that the history of science is\nfilled with with cases where the conceptual machinery of a flawed\ntheory is neither smoothly carried over to a new theory, nor fully\neliminated. Instead, it is substantially modified and reworked, with\nperhaps only some of its posits being dropped altogether. Thus,\nfull-blown eliminative materialism and complete reductionism are\nend-points on a continuum with many possibilities falling somewhere in\nbetween. The term \u201crevisionary materialism\u201d is often\ninvoked to denote the view that the theoretical framework of folk\npsychology will only be eliminated to a degree, and that various\ndimensions of our commonsense conception of the mind will be at least\npartly vindicated.\n",
