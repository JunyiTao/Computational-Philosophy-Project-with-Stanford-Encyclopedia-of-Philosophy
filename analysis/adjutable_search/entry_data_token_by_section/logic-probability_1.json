    "main_text": "Propositional Probability Logics\n2. Propositional Probability Logics\n\nIn this section, we will present a first family of probability logics,\nwhich are used to study questions of \u2018probability\npreservation\u2019 (or dually, \u2018uncertainty\npropagation\u2019). These systems do not extend the language with any\nprobabilistic operators, but rather deal with a\n\u2018classical\u2019 propositional language \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), which\nhas a countable set of atomic propositions, and the usual\ntruth-functional (Boolean) connectives.\n\nThe main idea is that the premises of a valid argument can be\nuncertain, in which case (deductive) validity imposes no conditions on\nthe (un)certainty of the conclusion. For example, the argument with\npremises \u2018if it will rain tomorrow, I will get wet\u2019 and\n\u2018it will rain tomorrow\u2019, and conclusion \u2018I will get\nwet\u2019 is valid, but if its second premise is uncertain, its\nconclusion will typically also be uncertain. Propositional probability\nlogics represent such uncertainties as probabilities, and study how\nthey \u2018flow\u2019 from the premises to the conclusion; in other\nwords, they do not study truth preservation, but rather\nprobability preservation. The following three subsections\ndiscuss systems that deal with increasingly more general versions of\nthis issue.\n",
