    "main_text": "Inadequate Descriptions || Neoliberalism as Ideal Theory\n2.4 Neoliberalism as Ideal Theory\n\nPhilosophers have come to understand ideal theory in a number of ways,\nbut we can follow John Rawls\u2019s (1971 [1999: 7\u20138,\n215\u20136, 308\u20139]) understanding of ideal theory as describing\nthe best social and political order in light of certain high-minded\naccounts of human capacities, behavior, and natural circumstances, in\nparticular a preparedness to comply with institutions that embody the\ncorrect conception of justice. Ideal theories of justice provide\naccounts of the \u201crealistic utopia\u201d that citizens should\nstrive for, a society where everyone acts as justice demands by fully\ncomplying with just institutional rules (Rawls 2001: 4, 13).\n\nNeoliberals reject both elements of political theorizing. First, they\ntend to reject theorizing about an ideal. This is because neoliberals\nare often skeptical about our ability acquire moral knowledge; there\nis an epistemic barrier to knowing what is truly right and good.\nAgain, Friedman repeatedly says that the case for a free society is\nthat we don\u2019t know \u201cwhat sin is\u201d and Hayek argues\nthat, given the limitations of our knowledge,\n\n\nIt is at least doubtful whether at this stage a detailed blueprint of\na desirable internal order of society would be of much use\u2014or\nwhether anyone is competent to furnish it. (1944 [2007: 237])\n\n\nHayek does not think that political philosophers invent societies;\nrather, neoliberals do not think they\u2019re in a position to\ndescribe how an ideal society would function.\n\nNow, importantly, Buchanan (1975: 91\u2013106) is a philosophical\nanarchist: \u201cThe ideal society is anarchy, in which no one man or\ngroup of men coerces another\u201d. And Friedman (1974a [2017: 87])\nthinks that it is \u201cdesirable to have a vision of the\nideal\u201d and seems to embrace libertarianism as that ideal.\nFurther, he may think that many of his favored welfare-state policies\nwould not be part of an ideal social order. Yet both Friedman and\nBuchanan think attempts to reach the ideal could backfire and so\npolitical economy should focus making marginal improvements to\ninstitutions. In this way, neoliberals sometimes have political\nideals, but it is not central to their politico-economic doctrine,\nthat is, to what they actually advocate.\n\nSecond, Hayek (1944 [2007: 157\u2013170]), Friedman (1962b [2017:\n23]), and Buchanan (Buchanan and Tullock 1962) all deny that we should\nassume that people will tend to comply with what justice and the law\nrequires. People go wrong, especially when they have too much\npower. As Friedman (1962b [2017: 23]) says, \u201cthe liberal\nconceives of men as imperfect beings\u201d and assumes that\norganizing society is as much about \u201cpreventing\n\u2018bad\u2019 people from doing harm\u201d as it is about helping\nothers do good. Buchanan\u2019s project is to theorize politics\n\u201cwithout romance\u201d and deny the feasibility of a\ncontractarian agreement on principles of justice. If anything,\ncompliance is an endogenous variable in their models of social order,\nwhere different sets of social rules will produce different levels of\ncompliance and are to be chosen in part on that basis. In brief,\ncompliance is never taken for granted. Their non-ideal theory\nis also associated with their opposition to socialisms of all kinds:\nsocialism is irresponsible ideal theory whose purported feasibility\nrests entirely on the illicit assumption that human nature can be\nmodified to make persons more rational and altruistic. Society will\nnot work as socialists predict.\n",
