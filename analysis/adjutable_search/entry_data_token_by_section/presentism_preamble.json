    "main_text": "\n\nPresentism is the view that only present things exist. So understood,\npresentism is primarily an ontological doctrine; it\u2019s a view\nabout what exists, absolutely and unrestrictedly. The view is the\nsubject of extensive discussion in the literature on time and change,\nwith much of it focused on the problems that presentism allegedly\nfaces. Thus, most of the literature that frames the development of\npresentism has grown up either in formulating objections to the view\n(e.g., Sider 2001: 11\u201352), or in response to such objections\n(e.g., Bigelow 1996; Markosian 2004), with exceptions to this largely\ncoming via the ways in which presentism is motivated. This entry\nmirrors the structure of that literature, for the most part.\nHere\u2019s the plan for what follows. We begin with a more detailed\nsketch of presentism, unpacking its commitments and motivations. Then,\nwe move to consider several concerns raised for presentists. We use\nthese to illustrate the breadth and severity of the challenges that\npresentism faces, as well as the range of different versions of\npresentism developed to help meet these challenges.\n",
