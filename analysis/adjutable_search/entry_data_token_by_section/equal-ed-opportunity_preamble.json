    "main_text": "\n\nIt is widely accepted that educational opportunities for children\nought to be equal. This thesis follows from two observations about\neducation and children: first, that education significantly influences\na person\u2019s life chances in terms of labor market success,\npreparation for democratic citizenship, and general human flourishing;\nand second, that children\u2019s life chances should not be fixed by\ncertain morally arbitrary circumstances of their birth such as their\nsocial class, race, and gender. But the precise meaning of, and\nimplications for, the ideal of equality of educational opportunity is\nthe subject of substantial disagreement (see Jencks 1988). This entry\nprovides a critical review of the nature and basis of those\ndisagreements.\n\nTo frame the discussion we introduce three key factors that underscore\nthe importance of treating equality of educational opportunity as an\nindependent concern, apart from theories of equality of opportunity\nmore generally. These factors are: the central place of education in\nmodern societies and the myriad opportunities it affords; the scarcity\nof high-quality educational opportunities for many children; and the\ncritical role of the state in providing educational opportunities.\nThese factors differentiate education from many other social goods. We\nfollow this with a brief history of how equality of educational\nopportunity has been interpreted in the United States since the 1950s\nand the evolving legal understandings of equality of opportunity. Our\nsubsequent analysis has implications for issues that are at the center\nof current litigation in the United States. But our philosophical\ndiscussion is intended to have wider reach, attempting to clarify the\nmost attractive competing conceptions of the concept.\n\n",
