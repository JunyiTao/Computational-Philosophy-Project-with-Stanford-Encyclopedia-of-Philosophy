    "main_text": "Beyond analogical arguments\n5. Beyond analogical arguments\n\nAs emphasized earlier, analogical reasoning takes in a great\ndeal more than analogical arguments. In this section, we examine two\nbroad contexts in which analogical reasoning is important.\n\nThe first, still closely linked to analogical arguments, is the\nconfirmation of scientific hypotheses. Confirmation is the process by\nwhich a scientific hypothesis receives inductive support on the basis\nof evidence (see\n evidence,\n confirmation, and\n Bayes\u2019 Theorem).\n Confirmation may also signify the logical relationship of\ninductive support that obtains between a hypothesis \\(H\\) and a\nproposition \\(E\\) that expresses the relevant evidence. Can analogical\narguments play a role, either in the process or in the logical\nrelationship? Arguably yes (to both), but this role has to be\ndelineated carefully, and several obstacles remain in the way of a\nclear account.\n\nThe second context is conceptual and theoretical development\nin cutting-edge scientific research. Analogies are used to suggest\npossible extensions of theoretical concepts and ideas. The reasoning\nis linked to considerations of plausibility, but there is no\nstraightforward analysis in terms of analogical arguments.\n",
