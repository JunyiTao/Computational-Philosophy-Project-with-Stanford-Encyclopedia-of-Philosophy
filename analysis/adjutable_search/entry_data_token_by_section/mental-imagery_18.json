    "main_text": "Mental imagery in action || Pragmatic mental imagery\n4.2 Pragmatic mental imagery\n\nNot only motor imagery, but mental imagery also plays an important\nrole in action execution (see Van Leeuwen 2011). Some of our actions\n(in fact, most of them) are perceptually guided actions: our\nperceptual states trigger and guide our action. When we pick up a\ncoffee cup to drink from it, this is a perceptually guided action: our\nperceptual state represents the spatial location of the cup, which\nthen guides your reaching movement (and does so in real time, if the\nperceptual state changes, your reaching movement changes immediately\nwithout you noticing any of these changes, see e.g., Paulignan et al.\n1991).\n\nIf, after looking at the coffee cup, you close your eyes and pick up\nthe cup with your eyes closed, your action is not perceptually guided\nas you do not perceive the coffee cup anymore. It is, in this case,\nguided by your visual mental imagery. You looked at the cup, you close\nyour eyes, form mental imagery of the cup\u2019s whereabouts (as well\nas its other properties that are necessary for performing this action,\nlike its weight and size) and your reaching action is guided by this\n\u2018pragmatic mental imagery\u2019 (Nanay 2013).\n\nIn the first case, the pragmatic mental imagery was formed on the\nbasis of your perceptual state: you looked at the cup and then you\nclosed your eyes, but it is this visual information that the mental\nimagery is based on. But pragmatic mental imagery is more than just\nsome kind of echo of sensory input. Suppose that you are in your\nbedroom and it is pitch dark. You want to switch on the light, but you\ncan\u2019t see the switch. You are nonetheless in a position to\nswitch it on given your memory of the room\u2019s layout and the\nlocation of the light switch in it. In this case, your pragmatic\nmental imagery is formed on the basis of your memory. But pragmatic\nmental imagery can be triggered by completely non-perceptual means as\nwell, for example, if I blindfold you and then explain to you in great\ndetails where exactly the coffee cup is in front of you, how far\nexactly to the left and how far exactly ahead, and so on. Your\npragmatic mental imagery can still guide your action, but it does so\nwithout any (visual) input. In our everyday life many of our actions,\nespecially our routine actions, like flossing, are in fact guided by\npragmatic mental imagery.\n",
