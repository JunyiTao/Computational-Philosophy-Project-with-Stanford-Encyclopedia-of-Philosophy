    "main_text": "Early Years\n2. Early Years\n\nGustav Theodor Fechner was born on April 19, 1801, in the then Saxon\nvillage of Gro\u00dfs\u00e4rchen. His father, Samuel Traugott Fischer\n(1765\u20131806), and indeed grandfather, were pastors in the\nvillage; and his mother, Dorothea Fechner (1744\u20131806), was also\nfrom a pastoral family. This religious background had a profound\neffect on Fechner, who would attempt to rationalize it in his\nphilosophy. \n\nGustav was the second of five children. He had an older brother,\nEduard Clemens (1799\u20131861), who was an artist, and who moved to\nParis in 1825; he had three younger sisters, Emilie, Clementine, and\nMathilde. Though only a village pastor, Samuel Fechner was a man of\nthe Enlightenment: he was the first in his village to inoculate his\nchildren; he put a lightning rod on the village church; and he was the\nfirst to give sermons without wearing a wig. By all accounts he was a\ncherished father; but he died when Gustav was only five. His death\nleft the family destitute. \n\nFechner showed great promise from an early age. He could speak Latin\neven as a boy. He learned quickly and studied avidly. When he was only\nfifteen, the Rektor of his Gymnasium said to him: \u201cFechner, you\nare still very young; you must leave because there is nothing more\nthat we can teach you\u201d (Kuntze 1892: 5). But, simply because he\nwas too young for the university, he had to stay an extra year in the\nGymnasium. When he was only sixteen, he went to the University of\nLeipzig. Since he could receive little help from his family, he had to\nrely on stipends and to give tutorials. Later Fechner would support\nhimself through translations and literary work. This reliance on hack\nliterary work, as we shall soon see, would prove fateful.\n\nFechner was, in the truest sense of the word, \u201cein\nLeipziger\u201d. Though he spent his childhood in\nGro\u00dfs\u00e4rchen and Dresden, he lived almost his entire life in\nLeipzig, from 1817 to 1887. He travelled outside it only for\nvacations, and only once for a short sojourn, a three month stay in\nParis in 1827. Leipzig was not intellectually restricting, however,\nsince, in the first half of the nineteenth century, it was in many\nrespects the cultural center of Germany. It was famous for its musical\nlife, for its book trade, and for its literary salons. It was called\n\u201cthe Paris of Germany\u201d. Fechner enjoyed this cultural life\nand was fully integrated into it.\n\nFechner first studied medicine, taking his Baccalaureate and doctoral\nexams in 1822. But he quickly became dissatisfied with the subject.\nAlthough he had the right to practice medicine, he confessed that he\ndid not have the least idea how to bleed an artery, to deliver\nchildren, or to apply a bandage (Kuntze 1892: 38). Medicine also did\nnot satisfy him as an intellectual discipline because its theories\nwere based more on authority and tradition rather than observation and\nexperiment. Because of his intellectual interests, Fechner soon\ngravitated toward physics, which applied higher standards and more\nrigorous methods than medicine. He gave up most of his lectures on\nmedicine and attended only the lectures of the physiologist Ernst\nHeinrich Weber (1795\u20131878) and the mathematician Karl Mollweide\n(1774\u20131825). For a while Fechner became Mollweide\u2019s\nassistant, but he confessed that he had little talent for mathematics\n(Kuntze 1892: 37). Weber\u2019s and Mollweide\u2019s work on\nperception would prove to be a profound influence on Fechner\u2019s\nlater psychophysics. \n\nA crucial event in Fechner\u2019s intellectual development came in\n1820 with his reading of Lorenz Oken\u2019s Lehrbuch zur\nNaturphilosophie (1809). Oken was an admirer of Schelling\u2019s\nNaturphilosophie, and in his Lehrbuch he set out to\nprovide a systematic exposition of its basic ideas and to reconcile\nits many opponents (in his \u201cVorrede\u201d [1809:\n v\u2013vi]).[3]\n Fechner was excited by Oken\u2019s breathtaking speculations about\nthe whole of nature. From his study of medicine he had become\naccustomed to see nature as a mechanism; but Oken gave him an exciting\nnew way of conceiving nature as an organic whole. Fechner later said\nof his first reading of Oken\u2019s book: \u201cA new light seemed\nto me to illuminate the whole world and the sciences of the world; I\nwas dazzled by it\u201d (Kuntze 1892: 39).\n\nFor the next four years, Fechner devoted himself to\nNaturphilosophie. Although he said that he little understood\nOken\u2019s book, of which he read only the first chapter, he went on\nto read other Naturphilosophen, especially Schelling and\nSteffens. He was indeed so involved in Naturphilosophie that\nin 1823 he wrote his PhD dissertation on it, Praemissae ad\ntheoriam organismi generalem (a summary is provided by Marilyn\nMarshall 1974b), which was a general theory of organisms. In 1824, in\na collection of essays, Stapelia mixta, he made his own\nproposals for the method of Naturphilosophie\n (1824).[4]\n\n\nIn the midst of his fascination with Naturphilosophie,\nFechner started writing satires under the pseudonym \u201cDr.\nMises\u201d. His first two publications were spoofs of the\npretensions and practices of the medicine of his day: Beweis,\nda\u00df der Mond aus Jodine bestehe (1821) and Panegyrikus\nder jezigen Medicin und Naturgeschichte (1822). These satires\nalso contain a critique of the methods of Naturphilosophie,\nwhich Dr. Mises chastened for its hasty analogies and its lack of\ncareful experimentation. Despite his awareness of its flaws, Fechner\ndid not lose his enthusiasm for Naturphilosophie. He believed\nthat its problems could be overcome by finding and employing the\nproper methodology. Hence the proposals in Stapelia mixta,\nwhich were designed to put Naturphilosophie on a sounder\nmethodological footing.\n\nHowever, in 1824, the very year in which Stapelia mixta\nappeared, Fechner seemed to have lost further confidence in\nNaturphilosophie. In that year he had begun to translate the\nFrench physicists Louis Jacques Th\u00e9nard (1777\u20131857) and\nJena Baptiste Biot (1774\u20131862), whose work deeply impressed him\n(Th\u00e9nard 1813\u201316 [trans. 1825\u201328] and Biot 1817\n[trans. 1828\u201329]). By following careful methods of\nexperimentation and observation, the French physicists seemed to\nproduce definite results. Fechner asked himself if Oken and Schelling\ncould ever have produced the precise laws of optics found in\nBiot\u2019s work? (Kuntze 1892: 39\u201340). \n\nDespite such disillusionment, Naturphilosophie would remain a\nprofound influence on Fechner. There are two fundamental ideals of\nNaturphilosophie which would have an enduring effect on him:\nfirst, its ideal of a unified worldview; and, second, its organic\nconcept of nature. However much Fechner rejected the methods of\nNaturphilosophie, he was still excited by these ideals, which\nhe would never renounce. Already by 1824, then, there is a basic\ntension in Fechner\u2019s intellectual life: the hankering for\nspeculative Naturphilosophie and the demand for exact\nscience. \n\nIn the Winter Semester 1823\u201324, at the tender age of twenty-two,\nFechner began his academic career by lecturing on physiology for the\nfaculty of medicine. After the death of Ludwig Gilbert\n(1769\u20131824), the Leipzig professor of physics, in 1824, Fechner\nserved as his temporary substitute. Because he was still so young, the\nposition could not be made permanent. It was only in 1834 that Fechner\nfinally became professor of physics in Leipzig. \n\nDuring the 1820s, Fechner began his first experimental work, taking as\nhis subject the new and exciting field of electricity. He conducted\nexperiments to test, and to perfect the measurements for, Ohm\u2019s\n law,[5]\n which had been discovered in 1826, but which was at first very\ncontroversial. Fechner\u2019s exact observations and experiments were\nhighly praised and contributed to the general acceptance of\nOhm\u2019s law. The experiments were collected under the title\nMa\u00dfbestimmungen \u00fcber die galvanische Kette\n(Leipzig: Brockhaus, 1831). \n\nIn 1827 Fechner took a long journey through Bavaria, Salzburg, Tirol,\nand Switzerland, which finally ended with his three month stay in\nParis. There he finally met Biot and Th\u00e9nard as well as\nAndr\u00e9 Marie Amp\u00e8re (1775\u20131836); their exacting\nexperimental work served as a model for him. Fechner\u2019s\ntranslations of Biot and Th\u00e9nard played an important role in\ndisseminating French mathematical science in Germany. \n\nFrom 1838 to 1840 Fechner undertook experiments on the psychology of\nsense perception. In doing so he became part of a Leipzig tradition:\nin the 1830s Alfred Volkmann (1801\u20131877), and Ernst Heinrich\nWeber (1795\u20131878) and Eduard Friedrich Weber (1806\u20131871)\nhad conducted experiments on the psychology and physiology of sense\nperception. Fechner continued in that tradition by conducting\nexperiments on color perception. He wanted to investigate the\nconnection between the objective phenomenon of light and its\nsubjective perception. He discovered that the appearance of many color\nphenomena is due more to retinal fatigue rather than any property of\nlight itself. Fechner\u2019s results proved fruitful and were later\ntaken up by\n Helmholtz.[6]\n\nAlthough Fechner was making a name for himself, he was still nearly\ndestitute. His lecturing posts were either poorly paid or not paid at\nall, so he somehow had to make up for the lack of income. To keep the\nwolf from the door, he engaged in various translation and writing\nprojects. The most questionable of these projects was his editing\nBreitkopf and H\u00e4rtel\u2019s Hauslexikon, a household\nguide (1834). This work consisted in eight volumes, each containing\neight to nine hundred pages; a third of the articles had to be written\nby Fechner himself. So our philosopher found himself writing on the\nbest way to set the table and how to cut meat. Fechner\u2019s motive\nfor undertaking this work was totally financial: previous editions of\nthe Hauslexikon had been very profitable. But, as fortune\nwould have it, this edition proved to be a bust. Fechner\u2019s\nmighty labors were for very little gain. It was working on such\nprojects that so exhausted him, leading to his breakdown in 1840.\n",
