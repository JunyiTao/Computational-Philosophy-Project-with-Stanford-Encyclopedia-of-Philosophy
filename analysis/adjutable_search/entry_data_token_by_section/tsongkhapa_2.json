    "main_text": "Early Period || Explanation of the Difficult Points (Kun gzhi dka' 'grel)\n2.1 Explanation of the Difficult Points (Kun gzhi dka' 'grel)\n\nTsongkhapa's most important works from his early period are his\nExplanation of the Difficult Points (Kun gzhi dka'\n'grel) and Golden Garland (Legs bshad gser\nphreng).\n\nIn the former he gives a detailed explanation of the\n\u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na (\u201cfoundation\nconsciousness\u201d)\u2013\u2013according to Tsongkhapa the\ndistinctive eighth consciousness in the eight-consciousness system of\nAsa\u1e45ga's (fourth century) Indian Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\nBuddhism.\n\nTsongkhapa opens his work with a brief discussion of the relationship\nbetween the views of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and Asa\u1e45ga. Tsongkhapa\nthen discovers in the different usages of the term\n\u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na and its near synonyms a\nnegative connotation conveying the cause and effect nature of repeated\nsuffering existences (Sk. sa\u1e43s\u0101ra). He surveys the\nrelevant literature, limiting his discussion of gotra\n(\u201clineage,\u201d in the sense of the innate ability a person\nhas to grow up into a fully enlightened being) to the presentation\ngiven in Asa\u1e45ga's Bodhisattva Levels\n(Bodhisattva-bh\u016bmi). There the \u201cresidual\nimpression left by listening [to the correct exposition of the\ntruth]\u201d (Sk. \u015bruta-v\u0101san\u0101) is the\n\u201cseed\u201d (Sk. b\u012bja) that matures into\nenlightenment. It is little more than the innate clarity of mind when\nit is freed from limitation by habituation to a correct vision of\nreality.\n\nTsongkhapa limits the sources for his explanation to non-tantric\nworks, almost all by persons he will later describe as Indian\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra writers, demonstrating thereby the influence the\ncategories used in the recently redacted Kanjur and Tenjur (Tib.\nbsTan 'gyur, the name for the commentaries in Tibetan\ntranslation included in the canon) had on his thinking.\n\nWhen Tsongkhapa arrived in Central Tibet, the pressing philosophical\nissue of the day was Dolpopa's (Dol po pa Shes rab rgyal\nmtshan) (1292\u20131361) Great Middle Way (Tib. dBu ma chen\npo, Sk. *Mah\u0101-madhayamaka) philosophy. It\npropounded a hermeneutics based on the principle that a Buddha will\nalways tell you clearly what he means. Based on a wide array of\nsources, and without making a clear distinction between tantric and\nnon-tantric works, the central tenet of the Great Middle Way is that\nan absolute, pure, transcendental mind endowed with all good qualities\nexists radically other than the ordinary world of appearance. It is\nthe archetypical Tibetan Buddhist gzhan stong (pronounced\nshentong, \u201cemptiness of other\u201d) philosophy.\n\nDolpopa, stressing the hermeneutic stated above, says\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna and Asa\u1e45ga, writing during the golden age,\nhave the same philosophy, the Great Middle Way clearly articulated by\nthe Buddha. Dolpopa distinguishes a pure, transcendental knowledge\n(Tib. kun gzhi ye shes) that is quite other than the defiled\nfoundation consciousness (Tib. kun gzhi rnam shes), and\nequates the former with his single absolute, endowed with all the\nqualities of a Buddha.\n\nLater, in his mature period, as explained below, Tsongkhapa will be\nexplicit. He will state categorically that Asa\u1e45ga's\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhism is quite separate from, and in profundity\ninferior to, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's Middle Way school (Wangchuk 2013),\nremoving all references to a Great Middle Way school. He will say the\n\u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na, devoid of subject-object\nbifurcation, provides the essential mind-stuff for defilement\n(=sa\u1e43s\u0101ra) and carries seeds for purification\n(=nirv\u0101\u1e47a) in a Yog\u0101c\u0101ra system that is\nfundamentally wrong, and at odds with the way things actually are. He\nwill give the \u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na only a heuristic\nvalue, and say a correct view (the *Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika-madhyamaka\nview) of the workings of psycho-physical reality (the Buddhist\nskandhas) totally invalidates it. As Jeffrey Hopkins (2002,\n2006b) has shown conclusively, such statements constitute an explicit\nrejection of Dolpopa's view, a position Tsongkhapa still is\nformulating in early works like the Explanation of the Difficult\nPoints.\n\nIn his Explanation of the Difficult Points, Tsongkhapa is\ncertain he does not accept the view of Dolpopa, but he is still unsure\nexactly what he will put in its place. He ignores Dolpopa's pure,\ntranscendental knowledge called \u0101laya, mentioning it\nobliquely, only in passing, during a final brief survey of views based\non Chinese sources; he leaves unanswered the question of the final\nontological status of the eighth consciousness, but appears to accept\nit as having a provisional reality; and he allows the views of\nAsa\u1e45ga set forth in the Bodhisattva-bh\u016bmi to\nretain an authority he will later explicitly deny.\n",
