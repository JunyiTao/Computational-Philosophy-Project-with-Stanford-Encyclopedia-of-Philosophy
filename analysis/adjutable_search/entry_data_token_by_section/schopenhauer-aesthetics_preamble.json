    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe focus of this entry is on Schopenhauer\u2019s aesthetic theory,\nwhich forms part of his organic philosophical system, but which can be\nappreciated and assessed to some extent on its own terms (for ways in\nwhich his aesthetic insights may be detached from his metaphysics see\nShapshay, 2012b). The theory is found predominantly in Book 3 of\nthe World as Will and Representation (WWR I) and in the\nelaboratory essays concerning Book 3 in the second volume (WWR II), and\nit is on these texts that I will concentrate here. This entry\noffers a brief background on Schopenhauer\u2019s metaphysics before\naddressing Schopenhauer\u2019s methodology in aesthetics, his account\nof the subjective and objective sides of aesthetic experience (both of\nthe beautiful and the sublime), his hierarchy of the arts and rationale\nfor this hierarchy, his view of artistic genius, the exceptional status\nof music among the fine arts, and the relationships he theorized\nbetween aesthetics and ethics.\n",
