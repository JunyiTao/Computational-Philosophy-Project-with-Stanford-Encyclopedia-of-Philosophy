    "main_text": "Literary Forms || Commentary\n2.4 Commentary\n\nThe ancient tradition of commentary on Aristotle begins with the\nedition of Aristotle by Andronicus of Rhodes, although not much\nsurvives from this period. The study of Aristotle became part of the\nNeoplatonic school curriculum, which began with the\nCategories and progressed through the Organon to the\nPhysics and Metaphysics. The curriculum culminated\nin the study of the Platonic dialogues, ending with the\nTimaeus and Parmenides. This school context for\ncommentaries became part of the commentary texts themselves in\nintroductory remarks to the Aristotelian corpus and to individual\nworks. Thus, authors covered a certain number of introductory\nquestions about the context for studying Aristotle and the particular\nAristotelian work under consideration, responses which assume the\nNeoplatonic curriculum. (For more on the ancient commentary tradition,\nsee Sorabji 1990.) The greatest influence in the Middle Ages, both\nLatin and Islamic, is the Neoplatonic tradition of commentary\nbeginning with Porphyry. Porphyry authored a work, no longer extant,\nshowing the ultimate harmony of Plato and Aristotle. In his commentary\non the Peri Hermeneias, Boethius repeated the same view and\nthe ambition to prove it through his work of translation and\ncommentary (Boethius Com. in lib. Peri hermeneias,\n79\u201380). Porphyry also originates the view of Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories as about words not things, and more specifically\nas about words as they apply to sensible things, thus leaving open the\npossibility that words might operate in a very different way when they\nrefer to Platonic forms (Marenbon 1999, 107\u2013116). This view of\nthe categories as categories of words is also transmitted by Boethius\nto the Middle Ages where it becomes standard. The larger view of\nAristotle\u2019s teachings enshrined in this interpretive shift is\nthat Aristotle and Plato\u2019s view can both be true, and hence,\nharmonious, if they are understood as writing about different things,\nAristotle about the sublunary world and Plato about the world beyond\nmatter and change. Throughout the Middle Ages, there is some degree of\nNeoplatonic distortion of Aristotle\u2019s teaching in commentaries\non his works. It tends to be less significant in the logical works and\nin the non-theological portions of the Physics and greater in\nDe Anima and sometimes Metaphysics commentaries.\n\nThe placement of Aristotelian works in this kind of context is\ntransmitted to the Latin Middle Ages by Boethius. Boethius thus brings\nto the medieval tradition of commentary both the obvious and more\nsubtle Neoplatonic distortions of the Aristotelian corpus. First,\nBoethius\u2019s commentaries are highly indebted to Neoplatonic\nsources. The thesis that Boethius simply copied his commentaries from\na single codex\u2019s collection of Greek commentators\u2019 remarks\nis too extreme, but it is nevertheless clear that Boethius relied\nheavily on Neoplatonic sources. We can see this in his commentary on\nthe Categories, where we have all of Boethius\u2019s\nsources. Here Boethius uses Porphyry as his main source, while\nsupplementing this material with other Neoplatonic sources (Ebbesen\n1990, 376\u201377). Had Boethius managed to get to the\nPhysics or Metaphysics for commentary, we might have\nseen his own Neoplatonic interpretations of Aristotle emerge more\nstrongly. As it is, such leanings are evident, for example, in his\ncommentary on the Peri Hermeneias. In his discussion of\nfuture contingents, Boethius follows the Neoplatonists, arguing for\nthe view that while there is real contingency in the sublunary world,\nthere is also necessity operating at other levels. Though he does not\nargue for providence until writing his Consolation, he does\nmake room for such a possibility in his Peri Hermeneias\ncommentary. There he argues, following Alexander of Aphrodisias, that\nsome things are necessitated, some subject to human control, and some\nare matters of chance; Aristotle is right that some things are\nundetermined, yet the Stoics are also right that some things are\nnecessitated and all things, though not necessitated by it, are\nsubject to the divine will (Boethius 1880, 220\u2013236, Sweeney\n2006, 16\u201320; Chadwick 1981, 159\u201363). Thus, Boethius\nfollows the Neoplatonic strategy of placing Aristotle\u2019s view\ninto a larger philosophical context where it can be seen as part of\nbut not the whole truth.\n\nAverroes (Ibn Rushd), who comes to be known as \u201cthe\nCommentator\u201d in the Latin West because of his magisterial grasp\nof Aristotle, is another important influence on the medieval\ncommentary tradition. He declares on numerous occasions that his aim\nin commenting on Aristotle is to explain the Aristotelian text, a task\nhe adheres to faithfully and with great success even though he lacked\nany knowledge of Greek. He does not introduce non-Aristotelian\nmaterial to explain Aristotle; he does not even, for example, make\nreference to Porphyry\u2019s introduction to the Categories,\nthe Isagoge, to help make sense of the Categories.\nHe does, however, add to the Aristotelian text in two ways. First and\nmost ubiquitously, he divides Aristotle\u2019s text into sections and\nchapters, some of which follow the divisions we now have, some of\nwhich he devises himself. The origin of the modern textual divisions\nof Aristotle\u2019s work is not known and those divisions are not\nauthoritative. Averroes may have worked with a text that contained no\ndivisions at all; thus he would have had to supply them all\n(Butterworth 1983, 6\u20138). Further, Averroes adds explanations of\naspects of Aristotle\u2019s text that are especially unclear or\nterse, and adds references to other works in the Aristotelian corpus\nto help explain particular texts. Averroes, like other ancient and\nmedieval commentators, assumed that there was no significant change or\ndevelopment in Aristotle\u2019s views over time and therefore that\nhis different works are consistent with each other.\n\nAverroes wrote three different kinds of commentaries, which have come\nto be known as \u201cshort,\u201d \u201cmiddle,\u201d and\n\u201clong\u201d commentaries. Scholars have now shown that these\nterms, though used to describe various kinds of commentary by Averroes\nor his editors, are often very fluid and do not mark off clear cut\ngenres (Gutas 1993, 31\u201342). Nonetheless, it is clear that\nAverroes composes different kinds of commentaries to serve different\npedagogical goals. He writes summaries or synopses of\nAristotle\u2019s works, as well as full-blown commentaries. Some\ncommentaries work toward an explanation of the letter of the text; in\nthese the source text is first cited and then interpreted virtually\nword for word. This is done sometimes in the form of a continuous\ntext, other times in the form of marginal notations to the main text.\nStill other commentaries, the type traditionally known as\n\u201cmiddle\u201d commentaries, are explanations of the sense\nrather than the letter, paraphrasing rather than commenting thoroughly\non the source text (Gutas 1993, 33\u20135).\n\nIn the Latin West during the 12th and 13th centuries the goal of\ncommentary was to explain the author\u2019s intention. However, until\nthe end of the 13th century, commentators worked on the assumption\nthat the author intended to express the truth; thus every effort was\nmade to bring an author\u2019s text into harmony with the truth as\nthe author understands it from what he takes to be authoritative\nsources. This attitude toward texts is generally thought to emerge\nfrom the tradition of biblical exegesis, where the biblical text is\nassumed to be true, to be in accord with the basic articles of faith,\nand, hence, as needing to be interpreted from within those parameters.\nMoreover, as interpreters began to collect different interpretations\nof biblical texts, they tended to deal with conflicts between\nauthorities by attempting to harmonize different opinions rather than\nsimply keeping some and discarding others. So, in an analogous way,\nfor example, Aquinas supports Aristotle\u2019s astronomy even in the\nface of conflicting mathematical evidence from Ptolemy. He argues that\nPtolemy\u2019s account \u201csaves the appearances\u201d but may\nnot in fact be true since the phenomena could be saved in some other\nway (Aquinas 1964, I, lec. 3; Lohr 1982, 93\u201394). Also, Aquinas\ntries to save Aristotle from unambiguously holding the position that\nthe world is eternal, arguing that Aristotle\u2019s argument for the\neternity of motion might be merely hypothetical (Aquinas 1964, Bk. I,\nlec. 29). In general, medieval Latin commentators through the 13th\ncentury rarely abandon the principle that the text makes some kind of\nsense. Thus, even when the Aristotelian text is extremely cryptic,\ncorrupt, or terse, commentators make every effort to give the text a\nclear and consistent sense, even if it must be almost completely\nconstructed. A very striking example of the commentator\u2019s art in\nthis regard is Aquinas\u2019s commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De\nAnima, especially his commentary on the very difficult passages\non the workings of the intellect (De Anima III, 5; Aquinas\n1994, III, lec. 7\u201310). As Kenny and Pinborg note, Ockham\njustified a less literal reading of Aristotle by asserting that\nAristotle often speaks metaphorically; at the other extreme, Latin\nAverroists offered views that might be seen as contrary to Church\nteaching by maintaining that they were only interpreting Aristotle,\nnot developing their own view (Kenny and Pinborg 1982, 29\u201330). A\nless dramatic but nonetheless important change introduced by medieval\ncommentators, continuing in commentaries after 1300, is making\ndivisions of the text and adding descriptions of the overall structure\nand forward progression of its arguments. These divisions and outlines\nof the text serve to give unity and coherence to a text even if it\nmight lack these features on its own.\n\nStarting in 1255, study in the work of the arts faculty at Paris was\nofficially centered around the works of Aristotle. Further, the\ncommentaries of the masters of arts rather than of theology brought a\ndifferent hermeneutic to the interpretation of Aristotle. No longer\ncommitted to Aristotle as a source for the truth (the truth was\npossessed by theology), the masters of arts did not try to bring\nAristotle into harmony with other authoritative sources and felt free\nto expose rather than try to save Aristotle from holding what they\ntook to be erroneous positions. Because Aristotle was no longer\nconsidered an essentially error-free authoritative source,\ncommentaries shifted to an emphasis on questions arising from the text\nrather than the exposition of text (Lohr 1982, 95\u20136). This shift\nis heralded by most scholars as marking an important development\ntoward modern notions of both science and commentary.\n\nNonetheless, even with this change in the status of the Aristotelian\nworks, Aristotle remained an authority in the sense that his texts\nwere still the starting point for discussion, and medieval philosophy\nin general remained centered on authoritative texts and, hence, on\ntheir commentaries. This emphasis on the commentary points to two\nimportant differences between medieval and much contemporary\nphilosophy. First, medieval philosophical writers understood their own\nwork as emerging out of a tradition of authorities rather than in\nabstraction from or in opposition to a tradition (see below section 3,\n\u201cRole of Authorities\u201d). Second, their work emerges out of\nan encounter with texts rather than in unmediated contact with ideas,\nproblems, or arguments. (On the assumptions and characteristics of a\ncommentary-based notion of philosophy see Smith 1991, 3\u20137.)\nThese ways of doing philosophy do not mean that medieval philosophers\nwere incapable of originality, only that their original thought comes\nout of an acknowledged connection with what went before. Nor does it\nmean that medieval philosophers were not engaged with ideas but only\nwords and texts. For, they would argue, we can only confront ideas\nthrough the language in which they are expressed.\n\nThe use of the commentary form expanded beyond its use in biblical\nexegesis and ancient authors (primarily Aristotle) to commentaries on\nMedieval texts treated as authoritaties to be commented on, for\nexample Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences and Maimonides\nGuide for the Perplexed, and in the second scholastic period\nthe Summa theologiae of Thomas Aquinas (See below, section\n2.8 on commentaries on Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences and\nalso recent work on the tradition of commentary on Maimonides\nGuide, De Souza 2018).\n",
