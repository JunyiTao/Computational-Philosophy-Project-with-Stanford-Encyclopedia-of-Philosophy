The Aristotelian Corpus: Character and Primary Divisions\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s writings tend to present formidable difficulties to\nhis novice readers. To begin, he makes heavy use of unexplained\ntechnical terminology, and his sentence structure can at times prove\nfrustrating. Further, on occasion a chapter or even a full\ntreatise coming down to us under his name appears haphazardly\norganized, if organized at all; indeed, in several cases, scholars\ndispute whether a continuous treatise currently arranged under a single\ntitle was ever intended by Aristotle to be published in its present\nform or was rather stitched together by some later editor employing\nwhatever principles of organization he deemed\n suitable.[4] \n This helps explain why\nstudents who turn to Aristotle after first being introduced to the\nsupple and mellifluous prose on display in Plato\u2019s dialogues\noften find the experience frustrating. Aristotle\u2019s prose\nrequires some acclimatization.\n\n           \nAll the more puzzling, then, is Cicero\u2019s observation that if\nPlato\u2019s prose was silver, Aristotle\u2019s was a flowing river\nof gold (Ac. Pr. 38.119, cf. Top. 1.3, De\nor. 1.2.49). Cicero was arguably the greatest prose stylist of\nLatin and was also without question an accomplished and fair-minded\ncritic of the prose styles of others writing in both Latin and\nGreek. We must assume, then, that Cicero had before him works of\nAristotle other than those we possess. In fact, we know that\nAristotle wrote dialogues, presumably while still in the Academy, and\nin their few surviving remnants we are afforded a glimpse of the style\nCicero describes. In most of what we possess, unfortunately, we\nfind work of a much less polished character. Rather,\nAristotle\u2019s extant works read like what they very probably are:\nlecture notes, drafts first written and then reworked, ongoing records\nof continuing investigations, and, generally speaking, in-house\ncompilations intended not for a general audience but for an inner\ncircle of auditors. These are to be contrasted with the\n\u201cexoteric\u201d writings Aristotle sometimes mentions, his more\ngraceful compositions intended for a wider audience (Pol.\n1278b30; EE 1217b22, 1218b34). Unfortunately, then, we\nare left for the most part, though certainly not entirely, with\nunfinished works in progress rather than with finished and polished\nproductions. Still, many of those who persist with Aristotle come\nto appreciate the unembellished directness of his style.\n\n\n           \nMore importantly, the unvarnished condition of Aristotle\u2019s\nsurviving treatises does not hamper our ability to come to grips with their\nphilosophical content. His thirty-one surviving works (that is,\nthose contained in the \u201cCorpus Aristotelicum\u201d of our\nmedieval manuscripts that are judged to be authentic) all contain\nrecognizably Aristotelian doctrine; and most of these contain theses\nwhose basic purport is clear, even where matters of detail and nuance\nare subject to exegetical controversy. \n\n\n           \nThese works may be categorized in terms of the intuitive\norganizational principles preferred by Aristotle. He refers to the\nbranches of learning as \u201csciences\u201d\n(epist\u00eamai), best regarded as organized bodies of\nlearning completed for presentation rather than as ongoing records of\nempirical researches. Moreover, again in his terminology, natural\nsciences such as physics are but one branch of theoretical\nscience, which comprises both empirical and non-empirical\npursuits. He distinguishes theoretical science from more practically\noriented studies, some of which concern human conduct and others of\nwhich focus on the productive crafts. Thus, the Aristotelian sciences\ndivide into three: (i) theoretical, (ii) practical, and (iii)\nproductive.  The principles of division are straightforward:\ntheoretical science seeks knowledge for its own sake; practical\nscience concerns conduct and goodness in action, both individual and\nsocietal; and productive science aims at the creation of beautiful or\nuseful objects (Top. 145a15\u201316;\nPhys. 192b8\u201312; DC 298a27\u201332,\nDA 403a27\u2013b2; Met. 1025b25, 1026a18\u201319,\n1064a16\u201319, b1\u20133; EN 1139a26\u201328,\n1141b29\u201332).\n\n\n(i) The theoretical sciences include prominently what\nAristotle calls first philosophy, or metaphysics as we now\ncall it, but also mathematics, and physics, or\nnatural philosophy.  Physics studies the natural universe as a\nwhole, and tends in Aristotle\u2019s hands to concentrate on\nconceptual puzzles pertaining to nature rather than on empirical research;\nbut it reaches further, so that it includes also a theory of causal\nexplanation and finally even a proof of an unmoved mover thought to be\nthe first and final cause of all motion. Many of the puzzles of primary\nconcern to Aristotle have proven perennially attractive to\nphilosophers, mathematicians, and theoretically inclined natural\nscientists. They include, as a small sample, Zeno\u2019s\nparadoxes of motion, puzzles about time, the nature of place, and\ndifficulties encountered in thought about the infinite. \n\n\nNatural philosophy also incorporates the special sciences, including\nbiology, botany, and astronomical theory. Most contemporary\ncritics think that Aristotle treats psychology as a sub-branch of\nnatural philosophy, because he regards the soul (psuch\u00ea)\nas the basic principle of life, including all animal and plant\nlife. In fact, however, the evidence for this conclusion is\ninconclusive at best. It is instructive to note that earlier periods of\nAristotelian scholarship thought this controversial, so that, for\ninstance, even something as innocuous-sounding as the question of the\nproper home of psychology in Aristotle\u2019s division of the sciences\nignited a multi-decade debate in the\n Renaissance.[5] \n\n\n(ii) Practical sciences are less contentious, at least as\nregards their range. These deal with conduct and action, both\nindividual and societal. Practical science thus contrasts with\ntheoretical science, which seeks knowledge for its own sake, and, less\nobviously, with the productive sciences, which deal with the creation\nof products external to sciences themselves. Both politics and\nethics fall under this branch.\n\n\n(iii) Finally, then, the productive sciences are mainly\ncrafts aimed at the production of artefacts, or of human productions\nmore broadly construed. The productive sciences include, among\nothers, ship-building, agriculture, and medicine, but also the arts of\nmusic, theatre, and dance. Another form of productive science is\nrhetoric, which treats the principles of speech-making appropriate to\nvarious forensic and persuasive settings, including centrally political\nassemblies.\n\n\nSignificantly, Aristotle\u2019s tri-fold division of the sciences\nmakes no mention of logic. Although he did not use the word\n\u2018logic\u2019 in our sense of the term, Aristotle in fact\ndeveloped the first formalized system of logic and valid\ninference. In Aristotle\u2019s framework\u2014although he is\nnowhere explicit about this\u2014logic belongs to no one science, but\nrather formulates the principles of correct argumentation suitable to\nall areas of inquiry in common. It systematizes the principles\nlicensing acceptable inference, and helps to highlight at an abstract\nlevel seductive patterns of incorrect inference to be avoided by anyone\nwith a primary interest in truth.   So, alongside his more\ntechnical work in logic and logical theory, Aristotle investigates\ninformal styles of argumentation and seeks to expose common patterns of\nfallacious reasoning.\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s investigations into logic and the forms of\nargumentation make up part of the group of works coming down to us from\nthe Middle Ages under the heading the Organon\n(organon = tool in Greek). Although not so\ncharacterized in these terms by Aristotle, the name is apt, so long as\nit is borne in mind that intellectual inquiry requires a broad range of\ntools. Thus, in addition to logic and argumentation (treated\nprimarily in the Prior Analytics and Topics), the\nworks included in the Organon deal with category theory, the\ndoctrine of propositions and terms, the structure of scientific theory,\nand to some extent the basic principles of epistemology.\n\n\n           \nWhen we slot Aristotle\u2019s most important surviving authentic works\ninto this scheme, we end up with the following basic\ndivisions of his major writings:\n\nOrganon\n\n \nCategories (Cat.)\nDe Interpretatione (DI) [On Interpretation]\nPrior Analytics (APr)\nPosterior Analytics (APo)\nTopics (Top.)\nSophistical Refutations (SE)\n\n\nTheoretical Sciences\n\n \nPhysics (Phys.)\nGeneration and Corruption (Gen. et Corr.)\nDe Caelo (DC) [On the Heavens]\nMetaphysics (Met.)\nDe Anima (DA) [On the Soul]\nParva Naturalia (PN) [Brief Natural Treatises]\nHistory of Animals (HA)\nParts of Animals (PA)\nMovement of Animals (MA)\nMeteorology (Meteor.)\nProgression of Animals (IA)\nGeneration of Animals (GA)\n\n\nPractical Sciences\n\n \nNicomachean Ethics (EN)\nEudemian Ethics (EE)\nMagna Moralia (MM) [Great Ethics]\nPolitics (Pol.)\n\n\nProductive Science\n \n \nRhetoric (Rhet.)\nPoetics (Poet.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe titles in this list are those in most common use today in\nEnglish-language scholarship, followed by standard abbreviations in\nparentheses. For no discernible reason, Latin titles are\ncustomarily employed in some cases, English in others. Where\nLatin titles are in general use, English equivalents are given in\nsquare brackets.\n",
