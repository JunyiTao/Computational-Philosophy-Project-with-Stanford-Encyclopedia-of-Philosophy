    "main_text": "Ethics || Contract theories\n5.5 Contract theories\n\nContract theories may appear somewhat more promising than the theories\ndiscussed above. The criterion that they offer for the deterministic\ncase, namely consent among all those involved, can also be applied to\nrisky options. It could be claimed that risk impositions are\nacceptable if and only if they are supported by a consensus. Such a\nconsensus, as conceived in contract theories, is either actual or\nhypothetical. \n\nActual consensus is unrealistic in a complex society where everyone\nperforms actions with marginal but additive effects on many\npeople\u2019s lives. According to the criterion of actual consensus,\nany local citizen will have a veto against anyone else who wants to\ndrive a car in the town where she lives. In this way citizens can\nblock each other, creating a society of stalemates. \n\nHypothetical consensus has been developed as a criterion in contract\ntheory in order to deal with inter-individual problems. We are invited\nto consider a hypothetical initial situation in which the social order\nof a future society has not yet been decided. When its future citizens\nmeet to choose a social order, each of them is ignorant of her or his\nposition in any of the social arrangements which they can choose\namong. According to John Rawls\u2019s theory of justice, they will\nthen all opt for a maximin solution, i.e. a social order in which the\nworst position that anyone can have in that society is as good as\npossible. In arguing for that solution, Rawls relied heavily on the\nassumption that none of the participants knows anything at all about\nthe probability that she will end up in one or other of the positions\nin a future social order (Rawls 1957; 1971; 1974). John Harsanyi, who\ndiscussed this problem prior to Rawls, assumed that the probability of\nfinding oneself in a particular social position is equal to the share\nof the population that will have the position in question, and that\nthis is also known by all participants. Hence, if a fifth of the\npopulation in a certain type of society will be migrant workers, then\neach participant in Harsanyi\u2019s initial situation will assume\nthat she has a twenty per cent probability of becoming a migrant\nworker, whereas none of the participants in Rawls\u2019s initial\nsituation will have a clue what that probability can be. In\nHarsanyi\u2019s initial situation, the participants will choose the\nsocial order with the highest expected utility (probability-weighted\nutility), thus taking all potential future positions into account,\nrather than only the least favourable one (Harsanyi 1953; 1955;\n1975).\n\nHowever, in discussions about various risks in our existing societies\nwe do not have much use for the hypothetical initial situations of\ncontract theory. The risks and uncertainties in real life are of quite\na different nature than the hypothetical uncertainty (or ignorance)\nabout one\u2019s own social position and conditions which is a\ncrucial requirement in the initial situation. The thought experiment\nof an initial situation does not seem to provide us with any\nintellectual tools for the moral appraisal of risks in addition to\nthose to which we have access even without trying to think away who we\nare.\n",
