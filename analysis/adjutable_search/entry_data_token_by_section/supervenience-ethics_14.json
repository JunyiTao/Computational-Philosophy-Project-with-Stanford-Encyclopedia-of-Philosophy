    "main_text": "Metaphysical Supervenience and Ethical Realism || Functionalist explanations of ethical supervenience\n4.2 Functionalist explanations of ethical supervenience\n\nOne influential account of metaphysical structure, especially in the\nphilosophy of mind, has been functionalism. Here is a simplified toy\nexample of a functional analysis: any system that takes some money as\nan input, and reliably produces a candy as an output, thereby counts\nas a candy machine. On this account, the kind candy machine\nis individuated by input-output relations. A functional kind\nis any kind that can be individuated in this way. Because functional\nkinds are not individuated by the nature of the stuff that realizes\nthe functional relations, they are often claimed to be\nparadigmatically friendly to multiple realization. Thus,\ngiven my characterization of candy machines, such a machine could be\nrealized by a structure composed of metal or of plastic or perhaps\neven of spooky supernatural stuff. In light of this possibility of\nmultiple realization, the relationship of functionalism to reduction\nis controversial: many philosophers have taken multiple realizability\nto constitute a barrier to reduction, but others disagree. (See the\nentries on\n functionalism\n and\n multiple realization\n for useful discussion).\n\nNow consider a version of ethical realism that takes ethical\nproperties to be functional properties. Such a view, like the\nreductionist view, appears well-placed to explain the metaphysical\nsupervenience of the ethical. This is because functional properties\nnecessarily covary with the class of properties that are their\npossible realizers. If, for example, every complex property that could\nrealize a candy machine is a natural property, then there could be no\n\u201ccandy machine difference\u201d without a naturalistic\ndifference. Similarly, if ethical properties are functional properties\nthat could only be realized by certain of the base properties, then\nthe supervenience of the ethical on the base properties would be\nsmoothly explained.\n",
