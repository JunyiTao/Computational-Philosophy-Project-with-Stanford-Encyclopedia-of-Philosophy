    "main_text": "Minority Cultural Rights Claims || Exclusive cultural use rights (or rights against cultural appropriation)\n2.8 Exclusive cultural use rights (or rights against cultural appropriation)\n\nA final cultural right that is claimed by some is the right to control\ncultural artifacts or expressions, or the use of cultural content in\ngeneral (Matthes 2016). This is the right that is at issue in recent\ncontroversies focused on cultural appropriation, defined as the use,\nby a non-member, of \u201csomething of cultural value, usually a\nsymbol or a practice, to others\u201d (Lenard & Balint 2020).\nFamiliar examples of actions that have been accused of engaging\nin\u00a0cultural appropriation include the wearing of dreadlocks by\nwhites; the donning of Indigenous clothing as Halloween costumes; the\nuse of turbans in high fashion; the teaching of yoga by instructors\nwho do not have South Asian backgrounds. In all of these cases, a\nnon-member is accused of \u201cappropriating\u201d a particular\ncultural practice or symbol that is not their own. On this view,\ncultures have exclusive rights to use their cultural\n\u201cproducts\u201d as they see fit, often because that practice is\nunderstood to be central to their identity. This perspective is\ncontroversial, and often mocked, by those who observe that history\njust is the mingling and sharing of cultural practices and symbols,\nincluding in the spaces of cuisine, the arts, dress and spiritual\npractices; their mocking treats the rights claim as relying on an\nunderstanding of culture that is unchanging and immutable over time,\nwhich is historically inaccurate and, furthermore, undesirable.\nCorrespondingly, key cultural artifacts are best understood as\nbelonging to \u201chumanity\u201d: \u201cit isn\u2019t peoples who\nexperience and value art: it\u2019s men and women\u201d (Appiah\n2009).\n\nThe right claimed\u2014to full or exclusive use of defining cultural\npractices or symbols\u2014is perhaps not best enforced by the state,\nthough states can and do engage in practices that are attentive to the\nharms allegedly caused\u00a0by cultural appropriation. For example,\ncentralized support for the arts, in the form of grants to produce\nartistic endeavours, can be sensitive to who is asking for\nsupport to produce what, and can direct funding towards\nartists from a particular tradition who aim to produce culturally\nspecific products, and correspondingly refuse (unless very good reason\nis offered) to support endeavours by cultural outsiders to produce\n\u201cinsider\u201d art (Rowell 1995; J. O. Young 2008). The right\nclaimed is\u00a0relatively stronger where a particular cultural\ncommunity is the victim of a power imbalance, where the cultural\ncommunity has expressly requested that a particular practice or symbol\nbe \u201cleft alone\u201d by a majority community, and where members\nof the majority community are\u00a0profiting on the basis of\nits use of the particular symbol or practice (Lenard & Balint\n2020). As in other cases, the right claimed by a cultural group is\nstrongest where there are persistent inequalities between the minority\nclaimant and the majority group.\n",
