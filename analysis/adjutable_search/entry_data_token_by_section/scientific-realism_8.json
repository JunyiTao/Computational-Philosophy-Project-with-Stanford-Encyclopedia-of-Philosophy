    "main_text": "Considerations Against Scientific Realism (and Responses) || The Pessimistic Induction\n3.3 The Pessimistic Induction\n\nWorries about underdetermination and inference to the best explanation\nare generally conceptual in nature, but the so-called pessimistic\ninduction (also called the \u201cpessimistic meta-induction\u201d,\nbecause it concerns the \u201cground level\u201d inductive\ninferences that generate scientific theories and law statements) is\nintended as an argument from empirical premises. If one considers the\nhistory of scientific theories in any given discipline, what one\ntypically finds is a regular turnover of older theories in favor of\nnewer ones, as scientific knowledge develops. From the point of view\nof the present, most past theories must be considered false; indeed,\nthis will be true from the point of view of most times. Therefore, by\nenumerative induction (that is, generalizing from these cases), surely\ntheories at any given time will ultimately be replaced and regarded as\nfalse from some future perspective. Thus, current theories are also\nfalse. The general idea of the pessimistic induction has a rich\npedigree. Though neither endorse the argument, Poincar\u00e9 ([1905]\n1952: 160), for instance, describes the seeming \u201cbankruptcy of\nscience\u201d given the apparently \u201cephemeral nature\u201d of\nscientific theories, which one finds \u201cabandoned one after\nanother\u201d, and Putnam (1978: 22\u201325) describes the challenge\nin terms of the failure of reference of terms for unobservables, with\nthe consequence that theories incorporating them cannot be said to be\ntrue. (For a summary of different formulations, see Wray 2015.)\n\nContemporary discussion commonly focuses on Laudan\u2019s (1981)\nargument to the effect that the history of science furnishes vast\nevidence of empirically successful theories that were later rejected;\nfrom subsequent perspectives, their unobservable terms were judged not\nto refer and thus, they cannot not be regarded as true or even\napproximately true. (If one prefers to define realism in terms of\nscientific ontology rather than reference and truth, one may rephrase\nthe worry in terms of the mistaken ontologies of past theories from\nlater perspectives.) Responses to this argument generally take one of\ntwo forms, the first stemming from the qualifications to realism\noutlined in\n section 1.3,\n and the second from the forms of realist selectivity outlined in\n section 2.3\u2014both\n can be understood as attempts to restrict the inductive basis of the\nargument in such a way as to foil the pessimistic conclusion. For\nexample, one might contend that if only sufficiently mature and\nnon-ad hoc theories are considered, the number whose central\nterms did not refer and/or that cannot be regarded as approximately\ntrue is dramatically reduced (see references,\n section 1.3).\n Or, the realist might grant that the history of science presents a\nrecord of significant referential discontinuity, but contend that,\nnevertheless, it also presents a record of impressive continuity\nregarding what is properly endorsed by realism, as recommended by\nexplanationists, entity realists, or structural realists (see\nreferences,\n section 2.3).\n (For other responses, see Leplin 1981; McAllister 1993; Chakravartty\n2007a: ch. 2; Doppelt 2007; Nola 2008; Roush 2010, 2015; and Fahrbach\n2011. Hardin & Rosenberg 1982; Cruse & Papineau 2002; and\nPapineau 2010 explore the idea that reference is irrelevant to\napproximate truth).\n\nIn just the way that some authors suggest that the miracle argument is\nan instance of fallacious reasoning\u2014the base rate fallacy (see\n section 2.1)\u2014some\n suggest that the pessimistic induction is likewise flawed (Lewis\n2001; Lange 2002; Magnus & Callender 2004). The argument is\nanalogous: the putative failure of reference on the part of past\nsuccessful theories, or their putative lack of approximate truth,\ncannot be used to derive a conclusion regarding the chances that our\ncurrent best theories do not refer to unobservables, or that they are\nnot approximately true, unless one knows the base rate of\nnon-referring or non-approximately true theories in the relevant\npools. And since one cannot know this independently, the pessimistic\ninduction is fallacious. Again, analogously, one might argue that to\nformalize the argument in terms of probabilities, as is required in\norder to invoke the base rate fallacy, is to miss the more fundamental\npoint underlying the pessimistic induction (Saatsi 2005b). One might\nread the argument simply as cutting a supposed link between the\nempirical success of scientific theories and successful reference or\napproximate truth, as opposed to relying on an inductive inference\nper se. If even a few examples from the history of science\ndemonstrate that theories can be empirically successful and yet fail\nto refer to the central unobservables they invoke, or fail to be what\nrealists would regard as approximately true, this constitutes a\nprima facie challenge to the notion that only realism can\nexplain the success of science.\n",
