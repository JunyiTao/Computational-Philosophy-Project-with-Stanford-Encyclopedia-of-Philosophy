    "main_text": "Africana Philosophy: The African Diaspora\n5. Africana Philosophy: The African Diaspora\n\n\nThe centuries of enslaving-relocations of millions of African\npeoples to the New Worlds of colonies-cum-nation-states\ncreated by European and Euro-American settler-colonists beginning in\nthe sixteenth century, and the subsequent centuries-long continuations\nof descendants of these African peoples in, and migrations of others\nto, these locales, occasioned the formation of new peoples of\nAfrican descent in the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, and elsewhere.\nIndividuals and groupings of these peoples developed and perpetuated\nshared creative responses to the impositions of various forms of\nsystematized racialized oppression and class exploitation motivated and\nrationalized by notions of White Racial Supremacy, and further complicated by\nconsiderations of sexuality and gender. In the New Worlds, as had\nbecome the case in Africa after the colonizing and enslaving incursions\nof acquisitive peoples from Europe and the Arabian peninsula, the\nrecurrent and decisive foci of life in the racialized crucibles were\nthe struggles to endure while resolving mind- and soul-rending tensions\nthat threatened and otherwise conditioned self- and community-formation\nand living.\n\n\nThere were several major sources of these tensions. One, the traumas\nof the radical dislocations experienced by the\nmillions of persons kidnapped and purchased into relocation to\nenslavement through terrifying transport across thousands of miles of\nocean during which many thousands died. Another, the soul and\npsyche-taxing ambiguities and ambivalences of being compelled to become\nand be, in important senses, both New World \u201cAfrican\u201d\nand \u201cAmerican,\u201d \u201cCanadian,\u201d\n\u201cBrazilian,\u201d \u201cPuerto Rican,\u201d\n\u201cTrinidadian,\u201d \u201cHaitian,\u201d\n\u201cJamaican,\u201d \u201cFrench,\u201d \u201cBritish,\u201d\netc., while, as slaves, being denied full access to the resources of\nthe prevailing meanings and practical realizations of the defining\nidentities of the most highly valued anthropological categorizations\nand social positions in the socio-political orders of the new states\nand locales as well as to the material resources crucial for realizing\nlives of well-being and denied full retention of and access to\nthe self-and community-defining resources of their natal cultures.\n\n\nHow the various African-descendant persons and communities resolved\nthese tensions conditioned the formation of new identities,\nlife-agendas, and praxes for living. Fundamental were the recurrent and\nvaried quests to survive and endure. With whatever\nsuccess there followed other fundamental recurrent and varied\nendeavors. Among the most compelling were quests to define and\nsecure freedom, quests that were profoundly affected by the\nabsence of any recourse to protections of law and by severe limitations\nimposed on Black peoples\u2019 participation in what has come to be\ncalled \u201cthe public sphere.\u201d Participation in this sphere\nwith protection of laws\u2014for example, to articulate one\u2019s\ncase for impartial and fair recognition and respect as a human being,\nparticularly as a woman or man of a despised race\u2014was hardly ever\nallowed in slave-holding polities, and very infrequently even in\nlocales where slavery had been abolished as invidious discrimination\nagainst persons of African descent continued. When speaking out or\notherwise expressing oneself on one\u2019s or one\u2019s\npeople\u2019s behalf was prohibited or strenuously circumscribed and\ncould be punished by beatings, imprisonment, or death with no legal\nprotection, the tensions were indeed wretched.\n\n\nThe variety of reasons for and means of coping in such\ncircumstances, and the variety of conceptions of life to be lived and\nof freedom to be achieved in the various New World locales, were\napproached differently by activist thinkers of African descent,\nconditioned by adaptive continuations\u2014more or less\u2014of some\nOld World African cultural agendas and practices. The efforts gave rise to\ndevelopments of different traditions of thought guiding the formation\nand pursuit of what would become, over time, a variety of agendas,\nfoci, objectives, and strategies of intellectual and practical\nengagement. It is these variegated, historically conditioned, socially\ngrounded, imperatives-driven thought and praxis complexes, immersed in\nand growing out of concerns and struggles for survival, endurance, and\nhuman dignity in freedom, that are being recovered and studied as the\nearliest instances of philosophizing by diasporic persons of African\ndescent and form the bases of the unfolding of several subfields of\nAfricana philosophy.\n",
