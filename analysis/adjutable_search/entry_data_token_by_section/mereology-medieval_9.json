    "main_text": "Parts || Parts of genera and universal wholes\n3.2 Parts of genera and universal wholes\n\nGenera are divisible into their subordinate species, whereas what\nBoethius calls \u201cuniversal wholes\u201d are divisible into their\nsubordinate individuals. In the medieval tradition that follows\nBoethius, these subordinate items are said to be\n\u201csubjective\u201d parts of the universal whole or the genus,\nsince the part is a subject and the whole is predicable of the part.\nSocrates is a subjective part of Human Being and a subjective part of\nAnimal, and Human Being and Animal are predicable of Socrates. That\nis, Socrates is a human being, and Socrates is an animal. However, to\nbe a true subjective part, not only must the name of the whole be\npredicable of the part, the definition of the whole also must be\npredicable of the part. A statue of Socrates could in some contexts be\ncalled a human. For example, suppose someone points to the statue and\nsays, \u201cThat\u2019s a man.\u201d, and then she points to\nanother statue and says, \u201cAnd that\u2019s a horse.\u201d. This\nperson is saying something intelligible, but the statue of Socrates\ncannot be a subjective part of Human Being, since the statue is not a\nrational mortal animal; in substance it is some marble shaped like a\nhuman with certain features. Socrates, however, is a subjective part\nbecause he is a human being and a rational mortal animal. Likewise,\nthe statue of a horse is not a horse in the proper sense, that is, in\nthe same sense that the Black Stallion and Mr. Ed are horses.\n\nGenera and universal wholes both consist of subjective parts, but they\ndiffer with respect to the items that are their subjective parts. This\nfact might explain why Boethius places universal wholes under the\nbroader class of true wholes. Boethius offers four criteria for\ndistinguishing between genera and true wholes (On Division\n879b\u2013d):\n\nThe genus is divided by means of a qualitative difference, whereas\nthe whole is divided by means of a quantitative difference.\nThe genus is naturally prior to its species, whereas the whole is\nnaturally posterior to its parts.\nThe genus is the matter for its species, whereas the parts are the\nmatter for the whole.\nThe species is always the same thing as its genus, while the part\nis sometimes not the same thing as its whole.\n\n\nSome of these criteria could be interpreted in a manner such that the\nuniversal consisting of individuals falls under the category of true\nwholes. Consider, for example, criterion (a). The genus Animal is\ndivided by considering what sort (qualis) of animal something\nis. Human Being is a rational animal, Horse is an\nirrational animal. In contrast, Human Being is not divided\nwith respect to what sort of human being Socrates is. Socrates and\nCicero are both rational animals. The difference between Socrates and\nCicero is due to the fact that this bit of matter which makes up\nSocrates is different from that bit of matter which makes up Cicero. A\ndifference in matter is typically considered to be a quantitative\ndifference. Hence, the parts of the universal whole Human Being appear\nto be distinguished by quantity rather than quality.\n\nHowever, some of the other criteria do not clearly mark genera off\nfrom universal wholes. Consider, for example, the second criterion.\nBoethius seems to have something like this in mind when he articulates\ndifference (b): the parts of a genus are dependent upon the genus,\nwhereas the whole is dependent upon its parts. In other words, if\nthere are no animals, there can be no dogs or humans. In contrast, the\nhouse depends upon its parts. If you take away the roof and floor, the\nhouse ceases to exist. But universal wholes seem to behave like\ngenera, not houses. If we annihilate individual humans, we do not\neliminate the universal Human Being. Therefore, difference (b) does\nnot cleanly demarcate genera from universal wholes.\n\nThe third and fourth criteria present their own special problems,\nsince it is far from clear how to interpret these differences, let\nalone whether the universal whole behaves like the genus or the true\nwhole.\n\nThus, it is not clear that Boethius\u2019s four criteria adequately\nseparate universals divided into universals from universals divided\ninto individuals. It may be that the better division is that between\nuniversal wholes and integral wholes, not genera and true wholes, and\nindeed many medieval philosophers seem to take this route.\n\nThis strategy, however, only provides some relief from the puzzles\nthat seem to arise from Boethius\u2019 four criteria. As we will see\nin the next section, there is still much more to be done to secure a\nclear and principled distinction between universal wholes and integral\nwholes.\n",
