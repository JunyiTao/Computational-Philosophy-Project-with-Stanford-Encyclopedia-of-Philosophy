    "main_text": "Method\n4. Method\n\nHobbes was very much interested in scientific explanation\nof the world: both its practice (which he saw himself as engaged in)\nand also its theory. Chapter 9 of Leviathan tells us\nsomething about the differences between scientific and historical\nknowledge, and the divisions between sciences. Chapter 6 of De\nCorpore gives a much fuller treatment of issues in the philosophy\nof science, issues of what Hobbes calls method. Method tells us how to\ninvestigate things in order to achieve scientia, the best\nsort of knowledge.\n\nThose writing about Hobbes\u2019s method have tended to tell one or\nother of two stories about the sort of method he proposes and its\nhistorical roots. One story emphasizes the connections between\nHobbes\u2019s method and Aristotelian approaches. This has often been\ndeveloped into a story about the particular influence on Hobbes of the\nworks of Giacomo Zabarella, a sixteenth-century Aristotelian who\nstudied and taught at the University of Padua, which influence is then\noften said to have been somehow mediated by Galileo. The alternative\nstory emphasizes the connections between Hobbes\u2019s general views\nabout method and the traditions of thinking about method in geometry.\nHere the notions of analysis and synthesis are key. Oddly enough, both\nof these stories can be connected to anecdotes that Aubrey tells about\nHobbes: on the one hand, the report that Hobbes became friendly with\nGalileo while traveling in Italy, and on the other, the tale of how\nHobbes became fascinated with geometry at the age of forty after\nlooking at copy of Euclid\u2019s Elements, not believing a\nproposition, and tracing back the demonstration of it and the\npropositions on which it depended.\n\nThis section tells a version of the first story. (For a helpful recent\ncritical discussion of such an approach, see Hattab 2014.) Still, one\nshould note that Hobbes sometimes uses the language of mathematical\nmethod, of analysis and synthesis, in describing his general method\n(Hobbes 1655, 6.1). Several commentators have seen this, together with\nhis clear admiration for the successes of geometry, as evidence of a\nmore general use of mathematical notions in his account of method\n(Talaska 1988). Adams 2019 argues that Hobbes \u201cproceeds by a\nmethod of synthetic demonstration\u201d in both geometry and\npolitical philosophy. And it might indeed be the case that both\nstories about Hobbes\u2019s method (the Zabarellan and the\nmathematical) have some truth to them.\n \nThose writing about Hobbes often describe Zabarella\u2019s method as\nhaving two parts, resolution and composition. Resolution moves from\nthe thing to be explained, which is an effect, to its causes, and then\ncomposition brings you back from causes to effects. At a suitably\ngeneral level that is correct, but it misses much detail. Most\nimportantly, Zabarella\u2019s method \u2014 as seen for instance in\nhis work De Regressu \u2013 is better described as having\nthree parts. A crucial though somewhat mysterious third step stands\nbetween the move from effect to cause and that from effect to cause.\nThe complete sequence, the arguments from effect to cause and back\nagain, Zabarella calls regressus. This sequence improves our\nknowledge, taking us from confused to clear knowledge of something.\nBut how do we do this? The first step is to move from having confused\nknowledge of the effect to having confused knowledge of the cause.\nRoughly, you need to figure out what caused the thing you\u2019re\ntrying to explain. The second step moves from confused to clear\nknowledge of the cause. This step works, Zabarella thinks, by a sort\nof intellectual examination of the cause. The aim is not just to know\nwhat thing is the cause, but to understand that thing. The final step\nthen moves from the clear knowledge of the cause to clear knowledge of\nthe effect. That is, your new full understanding of the cause gives\nyou better understanding of the thing caused by it.\n\nChapter six of De Corpore is Hobbes\u2019s main work on\nmethod. There Hobbes lays out a model of the proper form of a\nscientific explanation. A proper explanation tells you three things:\nwhat the cause is, the nature of the cause, and how the cause gives\nrise to the effect. Thus Hobbes accepts the Aristotelian idea that to\nhave the best sort of knowledge, scientific knowledge, is to know\nsomething through its causes. Similarities to Aristotelian theories\nsuch as Zabarella\u2019s show up even in section one of chapter six.\nHere Hobbes defines philosophy as knowledge acquired by correct\nreasoning. It is both knowledge of effects that you get through\nconception of their causes and knowledge of causes that you get\nthrough conception of their visible effects. Already we see signs of\nthe Aristotelian picture in which you come to know the cause by\nknowing the visible effect and to know the effect by knowing the\ncause.\n\nMoreover, there is perhaps in Hobbes\u2019s method something like the\nmiddle step of regressus. For Hobbes, to know an effect\nthrough its causes is to know what the causes are and how they work:\n\u201cWe are said to know scientifically some effect\nwhen we know what its causes are, in what subject they are, in\nwhat subject they introduce the effect, and how they do it\u201d\n(Hobbes 1655, 6.1). The requirement to know how the cause works, not\njust what it is, is analogous to the Zabarellan requirement to have\ndistinct knowledge of a cause. Knowledge that the cause exists comes\nfrom the first step of regressus. Complete\nregressus, i.e., complete explanation, requires that you make\na fuller investigation of the cause. For Hobbes, analogously, to get\nto scientia of the effect you need to understand, not just\nwhat the causes are, but how they work.\n\nComparison of Hobbes\u2019s view to Zabarella\u2019s and other more\nfully Aristotelian ones is complicated by Hobbes\u2019s thinking that\nall causes are efficient causes and that motion is the cause of all\nchange in the natural world. In a more fully Aristotelian picture,\nexplanations are causal, but causes can be of several sorts.\nHobbes\u2019s picture is more restrictive: to find the causes is to\nfind the efficient causes. Moreover, he thinks the efficient causes\nare all motions, so the search for causes becomes the search for\nmotions and mechanisms.\n\nFor all that there do seem to be similarities between Hobbes\u2019s\nmethod and older Aristotelian approaches, one might well wonder how\nHobbes could have come to know about Zabarella\u2019s views in\nparticular. One story is that Hobbes learned about this method from\nGalileo, but that claim is problematic. Galileo did know about\nZabarella\u2019s ideas and other similar ones (Wallace 1984).\nHowever, the texts of Galileo in which signs of Zabarellan ideas are\nevident are early ones, but Hobbes knew Galileo\u2019s thought\nthrough his later published works. But even if the\nZabarella-Galileo-Hobbes story is hard to support, there are other\nways in which Hobbes might have learned of Zabarella\u2019s work.\nHarvey, whose work Hobbes greatly admired, and who studied at the\nmedical school in Padua, might also have been an intermediary (Watkins\n1973, 41\u20132). And it\u2019s far from ridiculous to contemplate\nHobbes reading the work of the popular logician Zabarella.\n",
