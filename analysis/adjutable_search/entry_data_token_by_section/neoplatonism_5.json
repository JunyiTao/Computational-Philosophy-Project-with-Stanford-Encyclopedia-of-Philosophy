    "main_text": "Ethics\n6. Ethics\nAs human beings we are, with our bodies, part of the material\nworld; but importantly, we are living organisms that can place\nourselves in opposition to the needs and concerns of the body and\nreflect upon our own condition. Nothing just material would be able do\nthat, according to the Neoplatonists, and therefore we have what the\nancients called a \u201csoul\u201d. Moreover, our souls operate on a\nlevel of consciousness and intelligence that surpasses the cognition\nof all other creatures. Finally, just as everything else that has\nbeing, we are individual units and participate, again, as the\nNeoplatonists would express it, in the form of Unity.\nLooked at from this point of view, human existence is a striking\nrepresentation of the cosmos as a whole, a microcosm in which all\nlevels of being (Unity, Consciousness, Soul, Nature, Matter) are\ncombined into one organic individual. The Neoplatonists took this to\nbe a clear indication that we, just like the entire cosmic edifice,\n\u201ccame from above\u201d. A human being is therefore in the first\ninstance not a social or political being, but a divine being, and\nlife\u2019s purpose was seen not so much in the exercise and\nrehearsal of the traditional virtues that give meaning and quality to\nour interaction with others, but in seeking \u201cto bring back the\ngod in us to the divine in the All\u201d, as Plotinus pressed upon\nhis followers on the very point of his death (Porphyry, Life of\nPlotinus 2).\nNeoplatonic ethics recognizes the social importance and value of\nthe so-called cardinal virtues (justice, prudence, temperance, and\ncourage), but the virtues\u2019 main function lies in purifying and\npreparing us for a much more momentous individual relationship, that\nwith divine Consciousness and, ultimately, the first principle itself.\nNecessarily, then, the moral precepts of the Neoplatonists concern the\nindividual person, the goal being not the mundane fulfillment of life\nwithin the bounds of what is humanly possible, but nothing less than\neudaimonia in its most expansive sense, deification.\nUnsurprisingly, the route to salvation turned out to be the\nphilosophic life, a sincere and arduous effort of the mind to return\nto the One and forever abrogate any concerns for the body. It was on\nthis basis that the Neoplatonists would most vehemently protest\nagainst the latter-day Christian dogma that human salvation has\nalready been accomplished vicariously through the life and death of a\nman revered as the son of god.\n",
