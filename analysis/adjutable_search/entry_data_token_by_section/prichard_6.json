    "main_text": "Significant Issues on Which Prichard Changed His Mind || The moral motive\n6.1 The moral motive\n\nPrichard originally thought that conscience, or a sense of obligation,\nwas a distinct species of motive from desire. \u2018A sense of\nobligation does sometimes move us to act\u2019 (15). In this he was a\nprecursor of the direction that intuitionistic moral philosophy would\ntake 60 years later. By 1928, however, he had abandoned this dualist\nview, writing \u2018Again, if we face the purely general question\n\u2018Can we really do anything whatever unless in some respect or\nother we desire to do it?\u2019 we have to answer\n\u201cNo\u201d\u2019 (38; see also 129). On this new understanding\na sense of obligation was not a motive at all, since it involved no\ndesire; to get motivation, one needs in addition a desire to do the\nright. This \u2018externalist\u2019 position, also adopted by Ross,\nopened the door to complaints that on the intuitionist picture moral\ncognition was the recognition of facts that lacked any intrinsic\nconnection to action; it should be possible to come to know that it is\nwrong to kill the innocent without thinking of that as at all relevant\nto one\u2019s choice of action. And those complaints eventually\nbecame the strongest argument for non-cognitivism in meta-ethics.\n",
