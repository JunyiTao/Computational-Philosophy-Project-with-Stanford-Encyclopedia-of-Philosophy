    "main_text": "Premises: The Structures of Assertions\n4. Premises: The Structures of Assertions\n\nSyllogisms are structures of sentences each of which can meaningfully\nbe called true or false: assertions\n(apophanseis), in Aristotle\u2019s terminology. According to\nAristotle, every such sentence must have the same structure: it must\ncontain a subject (hupokeimenon) and a\npredicate and must either affirm or deny the\npredicate of the subject. Thus, every assertion is either the\naffirmation kataphasis or the\ndenial (apophasis) of a single predicate of\na single subject.\n\nIn On Interpretation, Aristotle argues that a single\nassertion must always either affirm or deny a single predicate of a\nsingle subject. Thus, he does not recognize sentential compounds, such\nas conjunctions and disjunctions, as single assertions. This appears\nto be a deliberate choice on his part: he argues, for instance, that a\nconjunction is simply a collection of assertions, with no more\nintrinsic unity than the sequence of sentences in a lengthy account\n(e.g. the entire Iliad, to take Aristotle\u2019s own\nexample). Since he also treats denials as one of the two basic species\nof assertion, he does not view negations as sentential compounds. His\ntreatment of conditional sentences and disjunctions is more difficult\nto appraise, but it is at any rate clear that Aristotle made no\nefforts to develop a sentential logic. Some of the consequences of\nthis for his theory of demonstration are important.\n",
