    "main_text": "Equity Issues || Sciences Studying Women\n1.2 Sciences Studying Women\n\nAs more women entered scientific fields during the twentieth century\nthey begin to focus on a variety of phenomena that previously had been\noverlooked\u2014phenomena present in the lives, domains, and\nexperiences of women. This point is beautifully illustrated by the\nnote that Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss made in an article describing his\nfield work in 1936:\n\n\nthe entire village left the next day in about thirty canoes, leaving\nus alone in the abandoned houses with the women and children. (1936:\n283, translated in Eichler & Lapointe 1985: 11) \n\n\nThe anthropologist finds himself \u201calone\u201d since the proper\nsubjects of research have left the village. As women entered\nanthropology they recognized those left behind as part of the fabric\nof the culture that they sought, as social scientists, to\nunderstand.\n\nNeglect was sometimes the result of lack of access. In some cultures\nmen do not have access to women and domains identified with women due\nto cultural restrictions on the interactions among genders. In other\ncases, lack of awareness or interest in the phenomena that were\nidentified as connected to women resulted in lacunae in research. In\neconomics, for example, the failure to identify the role of (mostly)\nwomen\u2019s domestic work as labor and hence as relevant to economic\nanalysis was not a result of its invisibility\u2014domestic labor is\npresent throughout human experience\u2014but rather because of\nconceptualizing labor so that such unpaid domestic labor remains\noutside of the economic sphere. It was economically\ninvisible. Women economists noticed and sought to correct this\nomission by clarifying the ways in which paid labor depends upon\ndomestic support and the role this plays in capitalism (Dalla Costa\n& James 1972; Federici 1975 [2020]; Himmelweit & Mohun 1977).\nPerhaps in part because of roots in the Marxist tradition and so its\nassociation with a non-mainstream economics, this understanding of\nlabor is still not fully incorporated into economics research.\n\nAdditionally, the domination of economics by rational choice theory\npushes against treating gender and gendered social structure as\nrelevant. The conception of the economic agent in rational choice\ntheory relies on an abstract understanding of agents as guided by\ntheir preferences. Any variation in the choices made by different\ngenders must be interpreted as a matter of differences in preferences.\nEmbedded in rational choice theory\u2019s fundamental assumption\nabout agents is the idea that gender is irrelevant to the analysis of\nhuman behavior. A number of feminist economists have noted that the\nreliance on rational choice approaches is a factor in the failure to\nincorporate feminist interests and insights into economics (see Barker\n1995; Barker & Kuiper 2003). Although behavioral economics has\nchallenged many assumptions of rational choice theory, its emergence\nas a new approach has not necessarily ameliorated the situation.\nRecent research suggests that much work in behavioral economics is\naffected by stereotypical assumptions about differences in the\nbehavior of men and women (Sent & van Staveren 2019). Thus the\nresponses to attempts to incorporate gender analyses into economics\ncan be summarized as follows: relevant gender differences are\nidentified but there is a lack uptake (domestic labor/work); gender is\ntreated as irrelevant; or when identified as relevant, sexist\nstereotypes permeate research.\n\nMedicine provides another example of the limited responsiveness of a\nfield to feminist critique. Heart disease in women was often not\nrecognized or understood primarily because the research had focused on\nmen. Although more recent research has included women, as late as 2017\nresearch on medical practice indicated that women still are not\nscreened for heart disease as regularly as men during routine health\nexaminations. In addition, 45% of women in a nationwide survey were\nunaware that heart disease is the number one cause of fatality for\nwomen (Bairey Merz et al. 2017). Since 1993 the National Institutes of\nHealth (NIH) has required that women (and minorities) be included in\nresearch projects that are NIH funded (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n However, there are problems recruiting and retaining sufficient\nnumbers of women for such research as evidenced by the literature\nreview on the topic at the NIH website. The requirement does not, in\nitself, correct gender inequities in medical research which tend to be\nmore systematic and structural.\n\nAs a final example, consider Pamela Paxton\u2019s critique of indices\nof democracy commonly used in political science research. Paxton\nargues that often the operationalization of democracy in the most\ncommonly used indices treats one of its key indicators,\n\u201cuniversal suffrage\u201d, as universal male\nsuffrage\u2014either implicitly or explicitly. When understood as\nincluding women\u2019s suffrage, Paxton notes that many of the key\nclaims of research on democracy\u2014including a standard\ninterpretation that identifies three waves of democracy\u2014may need\nto be revised (Paxton 2000). Although decisions about how to\noperationalize a concept like democracy can have far-reaching effects\nfor theoretical explanation, this is another case where uptake has\nbeen limited. Democracy indices have not been revised following\nPaxton\u2019s critique.\n\nThese are just three examples of how attempts to challenge content,\nwhile widely recognized as legitimate, have failed to bring about\nfundamental change. Such examples suggest that feminist goals require\nmore than the inclusion of women as researcher or their lives as\nobjects of inquiry. It is not enough to \u201cadd women and\nstir\u201d\u2014as has become clear in the struggle to gain parity\nin employment, education, and research. Deeper conceptual change and\ncritique of the way scientific research is structured are needed.\n",
