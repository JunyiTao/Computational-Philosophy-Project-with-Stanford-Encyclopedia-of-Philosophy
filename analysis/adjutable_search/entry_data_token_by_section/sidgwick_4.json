Religion and Parapsychology\n\nIn an intriguing piece of retrospection written in 1887, Sidgwick\nexplained: \n\n\nSome fifteen years ago, when I was writing my book on Ethics, I was\ninclined to hold with Kant that we must postulate the\ncontinued existence of the soul, in order to effect that harmony of\nDuty with Happiness which seemed to me indispensable to rational moral\nlife. At any rate I thought I might provisionally postulate\nit, while setting out on the serious search for empirical evidence. If\nI decide that this search is a failure, shall I finally and decisively\nmake this postulate? Can I consistently with my whole view of truth\nand the method of its attainment? And if I answer \u201cno\u201d to\neach of these questions, have I any ethical system at all? (quoted in\nMemoir: 467)\n\n\nWhether Sidgwick\u2019s memory was entirely accurate is uncertain. In\na letter actually composed in 1870, he confessed to his friend Roden\nNoel:\n\n\nI have never based my belief in immortality on our consciousness of\nthe oneness of Self. I have always considered Kant\u2019s\n\u201cParalogisms\u201d conclusive as against that.\n\nWhat I really base it on (apart from the evidence supplied by\nSpiritualism, and apart from religious grounds) is on Ethics,\nas Kant, supported by Common Sense. But I do not state the argument\nquite as you answer it, but thus\n\nIn the face of the conflict between Virtue & Happiness, my own\nvoluntary life, and that of every other man constituted like me, i.e.,\nI believe, of every normal man, is reduced to hopeless anarchy.\n\nTwo authorities roughly speaking Butler\u2019s\n\u201cself-love\u201d and \u201cConscience\u201d claim to rule,\nand neither will yield to the other.\n\nThe only way of avoiding this intolerable anarchy is by the Postulate\nof Immortality. But you may say\u2014\u201cyou cannot believe it\nbecause you want to\u201d\n\nI reply; I find\n\nin me an inherited predisposition to this faith.\nIn human history the belief is that of the best part of mankind:\nit has nearly, though not quite, the authority of a belief of Common\nSense. (quoted in Schultz 2004: 441).\n\n\n\nAt any rate, he often expressed dissatisfaction with the Kantian\nsolution, devoting endless hours to \u201cthe serious search for\nempirical evidence\u201d of personal survival. He had long been\nsympathetic to this type of natural theology, devoting more effort to\nit than to exploring alternative epistemological arguments of\nrelevance to the dualism. Indeed, Sidgwick joined the Cambridge\n\u201cGhost Society\u201d as an undergraduate, and he had already\ndevoted many years to informal psychical research before the formation\nof the Society for Psychical Research, in 1882, although his efforts\nexpanded thanks to the larger formal organization (Gauld 1968;\nOppenheim 1985; McLuhan & Gauld 2020\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n He was president of the SPR from 1882\u201385 and again from\n1888\u201393. The comparative sobriety of his leadership of this\norganization, which represented an unusual combination of eminent\nintellectuals, first-rate scientists, and spiritualistic lunatics,\nundoubtedly did a great deal to enhance its respectability and insure\nits longevity. Even many of the spiritualists, who were precommitted\nto belief in disembodied human spirits, seances, and so forth, allowed\nthat Sidgwick was as fair-minded as any non-mystic could be.\n\nSidgwick\u2019s parapsychology was clearly and admittedly an\nextension of his religious studies and as such relevant to the\nsolution of the dualism of practical reason. He did not successfully\nspell out the precise chain of argument leading from evidence for\nsurvival to a unified conception of practical reason, but the general\nTheistic idea of a \u201cfriendly Universe\u201d enjoying a\nutilitarian moral government was obviously behind his efforts. Again,\nalthough he was not sure that he could rationally defend it, he was\nstrongly drawn to the Theistic view that there is a \u201cHeart and\nMind\u201d behind phenomena\u2014a \u201cSovereign Will that orders\nall things rightly\u201d (Memoir: 604)\u2014and\nthat the universe is ethically meaningful, even if the storm and\nstress that he had suffered in the 1860s had permanently distanced him\nfrom Christian orthodoxy. Interestingly, his conversion to a more\nutilitarian mode of ethical theory had even predated his break with\nAnglican orthodoxy, which involved a long and painful struggle that\nhad him studying Hebrew and German, engaging with the new biblical\ncriticism of Strauss and Renan, and arguing with some of the most\nprominent theologians of his day, including Benson. He found, however,\nthat historical and philological study of the Bible could not answer\nthe deepest philosophical and ethical questions, which called for,\namong other things, free and open inquiry into the possibility of\nmiracles and paranormal phenomena. Unfortunately, he found that\northodox religion was all too often unreceptive to such forms of\ninquiry, and that his doubts about such matters as the Virgin Birth\nwere not adequately addressed by the theologians. In a revealing\npublic letter to the Times, Sidgwick distinguished three\ndifferent approaches to the Bible: \u201cSimple Scripturalism\u201d,\nwhich took it all as literally true, \u201cHistorical\nScripturalism\u201d, which took only its theological and moral\nstatements has having that standing, and \u201cRationalism\u201d,\nwhich held that, although the \u201cmost important part of religious\ntruth \u2026 was discovered or revealed before the first century of\nChristianity was closed\u201d, nonetheless \n\n\nthe process of development which the historical scripturalist traces\nbetween the earlier and later of them has continued since, and will\ncontinue, and that we cannot forecast its limits, and that even where\nthe doctrine of the Bible, taken as a whole, is clear, an appeal lies\nalways open to the common sense, common reason, and combined\nexperience of the religious portion of mankind. (quoted in Schultz\n2004: 83) \n\n\nSidgwick identified himself with the Rationalist camp, which was\ncongenial to developing a thin Theistic account of religion\nemphasizing the moral government of the universe, personal survival of\nphysical death, and the existence of a benevolent God. Indeed, he is\nconfident \u201cthat the thought of civilised Europe is moving\nrapidly in its direction, and that it must inevitably spread and\nprevail\u201d, though he also hopes \u201cthat it may spread with\nthe least possible disruption and disorganization of existing\ninstitutions, the least possible disruption of old sympathies and\nassociations\u201d. He is also confident, as he makes plain in\nvarious works, that the day of theological censure and\nauthoritarianism is passing.\n\nSidgwick\u2019s psychical research never yielded the hard proof of\nsurvival that he sought, and although at the end of his life he\nconcluded that it had been largely a waste of time, he allowed that\nthere were some positive results from it and that, at least in the\n1890s, some promising new lines of research had emerged. The\ninvestigation of personal survival turned out to be bound up with the\ninvestigation of many other purportedly paranormal phenomena:\ntelepathy, telekinesis, hypnotism, automatic writing, trance\nmediumship, apparitions of the living as well as the dead, the claims\nof Theosophy, etc. After all, it was argued, a medium supposedly\nrelaying information from the dead might instead be in telepathic\ncommunication with living sources of that information. Thus, in order\nto establish that communication from the \u201cother world\u201d had\nactually occurred, it was essential to be able to rule out the\npossibility of telepathy (Gauld 1968, 2007).\n\nThe \u201cSidgwick Group\u201d, as it was called\u2014that is,\nHenry and Eleanor Sidgwick, Arthur and Gerald Balfour, F. W. H. Myers,\nLord Rayleigh, Edmund Gurney, Frank Podmore, and a few\nothers\u2014worked in close collaboration, and ended up establishing\nto their satisfaction the reality of telepathic communication among\nthe living, the findings being presented in the series of massive (and\nquite sophisticated) studies Phantasms of the Dead,\nPhantasms of the Living, and the Census of\nHallucinations. As Myers explained the work:\n\n\nunder our heading of \u201cPhantasms of the living\u201d, we\npropose, in fact, to deal with all classes of cases where there is\nreason to suppose that the mind of one human being has affected the\nmind of another, without speech uttered, or word written, or sign\nmade;\u2014has affected it, that is to say, by other means than\nthrough the recognised channels of sense.\n\nTo such transmissions of thoughts or feelings we have elsewhere given\nthe name of telepathy; and the records of an experimental\nproof of the reality of telepathy will form a part of the present\nwork. But \u2026 we have included among telepathic phenomena a vast\nclass of cases which seem at first sight to involve something widely\ndifferent from a mere transference of thought.\n\nI refer to apparitions; excluding, indeed, the alleged\napparitions of the dead, but including the apparitions of all\npersons who are still living, as we know life, though they may be on\nthe very brink and border of physical dissolution. And these\napparitions \u2026 are themselves extremely various in character;\nincluding not visual phenomena alone, but auditory, tactile, or even\npurely ideational and emotional impressions. All these we have\nincluded under the term phantasm; a word which, though\netymologically a mere variant of phantom, has been less often\nused, and has not become so closely identified with visual\nimpressions alone. (Myers [1886], 1975: vol. II, ix)\n\n\nPsychical research, Myers goes on to suggest, can now claim \u201ca\ncertain amount of actual achievement\u201d. Thus,\n\n\nWe hold that we have proved by direct experiment, and corroborated by\nthe narratives contained in this book, the possibility of\ncommunications between two minds, inexplicable by any recognised\nphysical laws, but capable (under certain rare spontaneous conditions)\nof taking place when the persons concerned are at an indefinite\ndistance from each other. And we claim further that by investigations\nof the higher phenomena of mesmerism, and of the automatic action of\nthe mind, we have confirmed and expanded this view in various\ndirections, and attained a standing-point from which certain even\nstranger alleged phenomena begin to assume an intelligible aspect, and\nto suggest further discoveries to come.\n\nThus far the authors of this book, and also the main group of their\nfellow-workers, are substantially agreed. (Myers [1886], 1975: vol.\nII, xx)\n\n\nThis last line indicates, in particular, that Henry Sidgwick, whose\nname did not appear among the list of authors of these works, was in\nsubstantial agreement with their claims, which certainly appears to be\nthe case. As Broad, a later sympathizer, summarized one of the main\nconclusions of the most comprehensive of the studies, the Census\nof Hallucinations: \n\n\nAbout one visual hallucination in sixty-three occurs within a\nperiod of twenty-four hours round about the death of the person whose\napparition has been \u201cseen\u201d. If such deal-coincidences were\npurely fortuitous concurrences of causally independent events the\nproportion would be about one in nineteen thousand. \n\n\nBroad concluded that the Census was \u201ca uniquely and\nmeticulously careful contribution to an important branch of their\nsubject\u201d. (Broad 1938 [1952]: 144)\n\nBut these studies suggested that much of the supposed evidence for\npersonal survival was merely evidence for telepathic communications\nfrom the living (albeit, perhaps dying), and Sidgwick consequently\nfound much of this work distressing rather than encouraging. It was\nonly in the 1890s, with the famous case of Leonora Piper, that he came\nto think that there was something resembling a \u201cprima\nfacie\u201d case for survival. Piper was an American whose trance\nmediumship produced purported communications from particular deceased\npersons, and her claims withstood the combined scrutiny of the best\nresearchers in both the American and British S.P.R.s, including\nWilliam James, the Sidgwicks, Richard Hodgson, and Frank Podmore. As\nBraude (2003) indicates, the Piper case is still being debated to this\nday (see also Berger 1987). Evidence of this nature helped persuade\nEleanor Sidgwick, in the years following Henry\u2019s death, that his\npersonality had survived physical death and succeeded in communicating\nwith her. In an extremely curious, even bizarre, chapter of this\nhistory, Eleanor and her brothers, Arthur and Gerald, along with\nvarious close friends and colleagues, apparently developed a plot,\nsupposedly with help from the \u201cother side\u201d, to bring about\nthe birth of a \u201cspirit child\u201d who could become a new\nMessiah, ushering in a reign of global peace (Roy 2008; Gray 2011;\nSchultz 2017). What the actual, historical Henry might have made of\nsuch an effort at applied esoteric morality is a very intriguing\nquestion. \n\nIf much of Sidgwick\u2019s psychical research today looks rather\ngullible, it must be allowed that his positive conclusions were always\nvery cautious and guarded, and that his work in fact had an\noverwhelmingly negative, destructive effect, akin to that of recent\ndebunkers of parapsychology. The Sidgwick Group exposed one fraud\nafter another, including the fraudulent claims of Madame Blavatsky and\nthe Theosophical movement, though Theosophists continue to dispute\nthis. Indeed, Theosophy remains an influential \u201cNew Age\u201d\nform of the esoteric spiritualism that Sidgwick found attractive\n(given its concern with the common mystical core of all religions) but\nimpossible to defend (Oppenheim 1985). Insofar as parapsychology has\never enjoyed any standing as a rigorous field of scientific inquiry,\nthis is thanks to the efforts of Sidgwick. Furthermore, the work of\nthe Sidgwick Group helped pave the way for much of the developing\nresearch in depth psychology generally, calling attention to the\nefforts of Freud, Charcot, Richet and many others whose names are not\nprimarily associated with parapsychology (Gauld 1968, 2007).\n\nThus, Sidgwick\u2019s parapsychological investigations were of\na-piece with his work on ethics and religion, and, especially in the\nlate 1880s, similarly frustrating. As he explained to his close friend\nSymonds, he had \n\n\ntried all methods in turn\u2014all that I found pointed out\nby any of those who have gone before me; and all in turn have\nfailed\u2014revelational, rational, empirical methods\u2014there is\nno proof in any of them. (Memoir: 472) \n\n\nBut Sidgwick was not eager to publicly proclaim the negative results\nof his investigations, any more than he was eager to publicly proclaim\nthe skepticism about orthodox religion with with which they were\nentangled. In the 1860s, in his work with the Free Christian Union and\nreligious investigations generally, he had been more open, freely\nidentifying himself as a Rationalist and a skeptic. But in the\naftermath of his resignation, he ceased to attack openly the religious\nbeliefs and organizations that he deemed indefensible. As he later\nexplained to an old friend:\n\n\nIn fact, the reason why I keep strict silence now for many years with\nregard to theology is that while I cannot myself discover adequate\nrational basis for the Christian hope of happy immortality, it seems\nto be that the general loss of such a hope, from the minds of average\nhuman beings as now constituted, would be an evil of which I cannot\npretend to measure the extent. I am not prepared to say that the\ndissolution of the existing social order would follow, but I think the\ndanger of such dissolution would be seriously increased, and that the\nevil would certainly be very great. (Memoir: 357)\n\n\nCaught between the \u201cGreat Either-Or\u201d of \u201cPessimism\nor Faith\u201d, Sidgwick may have regarded his position as \u201can\ninevitable point in the process of thought\u201d, but it was one he\ntook \u201cas a soldier takes a post of difficulty\u201d, and he\ncould not assume the responsibility of drawing others to it\n(Memoir: 354). He was not sure that the subject of ethics was\nsufficiently like science and unlike theology to render his academic\nposition legitimate, even if he did not have to swear belief in the\nThirty-Nine Articles. But he did allow himself the hope that \n\n\na considerable improvement in average human beings in this respect of\nsympathy is like to increase the mundane happiness for men generally,\nand to render the hope of future happiness less needed to sustain them\nin the trials of life. (Memoir: 358) \n\n\nHence, the importance of political and educational reform. It was\n\u201cpremature to despair\u201d. Indeed, if Placido Bucolo, the\nforce behind an impressive series of conferences on Sidgwick hosted by\nthe University of Catania, is correct, Sidgwick\u2019s non-despairing\nTheistic heart shone through his work and activities throughout his\nlife (Bucolo, Crisp, & Schultz [eds] 2007, [eds] 2011). But there\nis still a great deal of research to do on this subject, on the\npolitics and sociology of parapsychology (see Warner 2006), as well as\nthe way in which Sidgwick distanced himself from Kantian arguments for\nreligious belief. Such research will likely prove more fruitful if it\nresists the temptation to treat the Methods as a stand-alone\nwork, with a narrow, textualist interpretive approach that Sidgwick\nhimself would have rejected. Even Parfit failed to notice that\nSidgwick had, in his psychical research, addressed the issue of the\nphilosophical significance of a Reductionist view of personal\nidentity, albeit in richer terms than the Humean ones alluded to in\nthe Methods (Schultz 2004, 2018).\n\nStill, perhaps the larger point of Sidgwick\u2019s worries about the\ndualism and related issues is best captured by the gloss that, in the\nsecond edition of the Methods, he put on the dualism and its\npossible resolution by the appropriate Theistic premise:\n\n\nFor, if we find an ultimate and fundamental contradiction in our\napparent intuitions of what is Reasonable in conduct, we seem forced\nto the conclusion that they were not really intuitions after all, and\nthat the apparently intuitive operation of the Practical Reason is\nessentially illusory. Therefore it is, one may say, a matter of life\nand death to the Practical Reason that this premise should be somehow\nobtained\u2026. it seems plain that in proportion as man has lived\nin the exercise of the Practical Reason\u2014as he believed\u2014and\nfeels as an actual force the desire to do what is right and reasonable\nas such, his demand for this premise will be intense and imperious.\nThus we are not surprised to find Socrates\u2014the type for all ages\nof the man in whom this desire is predominant\u2014declaring with\nsimple conviction that \u201cif the Rulers of the Universe do not\nprefer the just man to the unjust, it is better to die than to\nlive\u201d. And we must observe that in the feeling that prompts to\nsuch a declaration the desire to rationalize one\u2019s own conduct\nis not the sole, nor perhaps always the most prominent, element. For\nhowever difficult it may practically be to do one\u2019s duty when it\ncomes into conflict with one\u2019s happiness, it often does not seem\nvery difficult, when we are considering the question in the abstract,\nto decide in favour of duty. When a man passionately refuses to\nbelieve that the \u201cWages of Virtue\u201d can \u201cbe\ndust\u201d, it is often less from any private reckoning about his own\nwages than from a disinterested aversion to a universe so\nfundamentally irrational that \u201cGood for the Individual\u201d is\nnot ultimately identified with \u201cUniversal Good\u201d. (Sidgwick\n1877: 468\u201369)\n\n\nIt was, plausibly, this spectre of an unfriendly universe, of a\nperverse Cosmos and a fragmented self in which reason is schizophrenic\nor indeterminate, and the Wages of Virtue all too often dust, that\nmost deeply disturbed Sidgwick, even if he sometimes articulated the\nissue in drier philosophical terms. And any successful but more\nlimited defense of one side or another of the dualism may well have\nbeen, for him, only a very partial victory, a battle rather than the\nwar. His deepest convictions were more Tennysonian\u2014the allusions\nto \u201cwages\u201d being to Tennyson\u2019s poem of that title,\nthe last stanza of which reads:\n\n\nThe wages of sin is death: if the wages of Virtue be dust,\n\nWould she have heart to endure for the life of the worm and the fly?\n\nShe desires no isles of the blest, no quiet seats of the just,\n\nTo rest in a golden grove, or to bask in a summer sky;\n\nGive her the wages of going on, and not to die.\n\n\nAt the least, as Phillips (2022: 230\u201331) observes in connection\nwith the debunking argument of de Lazari-Radek and Singer, \n\n\nif they do succeed, Sidgwick would get one thing he would certainly\nhave liked\u2014an argument for the truth of utilitarianism\u2014at\nthe cost of losing another thing he also very much wanted, an argument\nfor the existence of God. \n\n\nBut that might be better put: what concerned Sidgwick most deeply was\nhow to defend a vision of a friendly moral order of the universe in\nwhich best for all and best for oneself were happily harmonized, with\nneither sacrificed for the sake of the other. Small wonder that he did\nnot find what he was looking for.\n",
