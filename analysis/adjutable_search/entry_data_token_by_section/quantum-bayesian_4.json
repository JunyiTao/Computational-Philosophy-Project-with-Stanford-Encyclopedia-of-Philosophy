    "main_text": "QBism || Nonlocality\n1.4 Nonlocality\n\nBell\u2019s arguments (2004) have convinced some physicists and many\nphilosophers that certain patterns of correlation among spatially\nseparated events correctly predicted by quantum theory manifest\nnon-local influences between some of these events (see entry on\n action at a distance in quantum mechanics).\n QBists use their view of measurement-as-experience to reject any such\nnon-local influences.\n\nFor a QBist, what science rests on are not objective reports of\nlocalized physical events but the individual agent\u2019s\nexperiences. Being present at a single location, at no time does an\nindividual agent experience spatially separated\n events.[3]\n Correlations taken to manifest non-local influences supposedly\nconcern events in different places\u2014say where Alice is and where\nBob is. But Alice can only experience events where she is, not at\nBob\u2019s distant location. When she hears Bob\u2019s report of\nwhat he experienced at a distant location, this is an experience she\nhas where she is, not where Bob reports having had his\nexperience. So quantum theory is answerable to patterns of correlation\nnot among spatially separated physical events, but among Alice\u2019s\n(as also among Bob\u2019s) spatially coincident experiences. QBists\nargue that Alice, Bob, and any other agent can use quantum theory\nsuccessfully to account for her or his experiences with no appeal to\nany physical states (hidden or otherwise) or non-local physical\ninfluences.\n",
