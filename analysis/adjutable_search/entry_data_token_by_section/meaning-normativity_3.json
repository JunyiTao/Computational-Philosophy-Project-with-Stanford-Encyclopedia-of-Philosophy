    "main_text": "Meaning || Meaning Engendered Normativity\n2.1 Meaning Engendered Normativity\n\nIt is clear that the type of normativity Kripke has in mind is ME\nnormativity; i.e., the claim is that meaning statements such as\n\u201cexpression \\(e\\) means \\(M\\) for \\(S\\)\u201d have normative\nconsequences. Moreover, it is clear that the relevant normativity is\nthat of prescriptivity, concerning what \\(S\\) ought to\n do.[10]\n As noted above, arguments in support of the thesis that meaning is\nessentially normative need to be based on semantic\npremises\u2014the normativity in question cannot derive from external\nsources. In the case of ME normativity, the arguments may be more or\nless direct, depending on more or less substantial assumptions about\nmeaning. On one end of the spectrum are arguments that turn on the\nidea that there are direct conceptual entailments from meaning\nstatements to normative consequences; on the other end are arguments\nthat depend on substantial theoretical assumptions about meaning. In\nthe debate, direct arguments have played a prominent role since these\nfit the idea, implicit in Kripke, that the claim that meaning is\nnormative provides a pre-theoretical constraint on any acceptable\ntheory of meaning; one that has to be accepted independently of\none\u2019s specific semantic theory. Let us begin with the most well\nknown direct argument in support of ME normativity, what we call\n\u201cthe simple argument\u201d.\n2.1.1 The Simple Argument\n\nThe classic defense of ME normativity can be found in Paul Boghossian\n(1989a). According to Boghossian the normativity of meaning derives\nfrom the fact that meaningful expressions have correctness conditions.\nIf \u201cgreen\u201d means green, Boghossian argues, it\nfollows immediately that \u201cgreen\u201d applies correctly only to\ngreen objects, and this, in turn, has immediate normative consequences\nfor how a speaker \\(S\\) should apply \u201cgreen\u201d:\n\n\nThe fact that the expression means something implies, that is, a whole\nset of normative truths about my behavior with that\nexpression: namely, that my use is correct in application to certain\nobjects and not in application to others. (1989a: 513; see also\nBlackburn 1984: 281; Miller 1998: 198; Whiting 2007 and 2009.)\n\n\nThe strategy, therefore, is to move from (CM), to a normative\nconclusion, \\((\\ME_1)\\):\n\n(CM)\nFor any speaker \\(S\\), and any time \\(t\\): if \u201cgreen\u201d\nmeans green for \\(S\\) at \\(t\\), then it is correct for \\(S\\)\nto apply \u201cgreen\u201d to an object \\(x\\) iff \\(x\\) is green at\n\\(t\\).\n\\((\\ME_1)\\)\nFor any speaker \\(S\\), and any time \\(t\\): if \u201cgreen\u201d\nmeans green for \\(S\\) at \\(t\\), then \\(S\\) ought to apply\n\u201cgreen\u201d to an object \\(x\\) iff \\(x\\) is green at\n\\(t\\).\n\n\n(CM)\n can hardly be challenged: Meaningful expressions have semantic\ncorrectness conditions. Of course, there is some controversy as to how\nthese correctness conditions are to be construed, whether the basic\nnotion of semantic correctness is that of truth or warranted\nassertability, for instance. However, it cannot be questioned that\nsome notion of semantic correctness is required. This, indeed, seems\nto be part of the very concept of meaning. If, therefore, the notion\nof semantic correctness is an essentially normative notion, we would\nhave a very direct argument in support of ME normativity, based simply\non conceptual entailments. Before discussing the argument, let us make\nsome preliminary remarks concerning\n \\((\\ME_1)\\).\n\nFirst, what is it to apply an expression? It should be clear that the\nrelevant notion of application is that of predication. For\ninstance, we apply a predicate such as \u201cgreen\u201d when we use\nit in an assertion, to predicate a property of an object \\(x\\). In the\ncase of singular terms, similarly, what is of relevance is referential\n use.[11]\n The notion of application, hence, is more narrow than that of\nuse, since we use our terms in a wide variety of ways that do\nnot include the expression of judgments, as when we ask a question or\nmake a hypothetical statement (see Millar 2004: 162; Reiland\nforthcominga).\n\nSecond, how should the deontic operator in\n \\((\\ME_1)\\)\n be construed? Since \\((\\ME_1)\\) involves an embedded conditional, we\nmay in fact distinguish between three readings, a narrow scope\nreading, an intermediate and a wide scope reading:\n\n\\((\\ME_{1}')\\)\nIf \u201cgreen\u201d means green for \\(S\\) at \\(t\\),\nthen (\\(S\\) ought to (apply \u201cgreen\u201d to \\(x)\\) iff \\(x\\) is\ngreen).\n\\((\\ME_{1}'')\\)\nIf \u201cgreen\u201d means green for \\(S\\) at \\(t\\),\nthen (\\(S\\) ought to (apply \u201cgreen\u201d to \\(x\\) iff \\(x\\) is\ngreen)).\n\\((\\ME_{1}''')\\)\n\\(S\\) ought to (if \u201cgreen\u201d means green for\n\\(S\\) at \\(t\\), apply \u201cgreen\u201d to \\(x\\) iff \\(x\\) is\ngreen).\n\n\nIn the debate, all three construals can be found. Thus, it has been\nsuggested that the intermediate scope interpretation best captures the\nintuition that if \\(S\\) means green by \u201cgreen\u201d\nshe is thereby obligated to use the term in certain ways (under\ncertain conditions), without (as on the narrow scope reading) implying\nthat the obligation is conditional on \\(x\\) being green (Hattiangadi\n2006: 225, fn 4). Another issue concerns the possibility of detaching.\nSome favor the narrow scope reading, since it allows one to detach the\n\u201cought\u201d, and supports the intuition that the semantic\nobligation can only be discharged one way: in this case, by applying\n\u201cgreen\u201d to green objects (Bykvist & Hattiangadi 2007:\n283). Others prefer the wide scope reading, precisely because it does\nnot allow one to detach \u201cought\u201d and hence implies a more\ndisjunctive obligation: \\(S\\) ought either to apply\n\u201cgreen\u201d to green objects, or not mean green by\n\u201cgreen\u201d (Gampel 1997: 228; Millar 2004:\n168\u2013169).\n\nA related question is whether\n \\((\\ME_1)\\)\n clashes with the widely endorsed principle that ought\nimplies can. As it stands, \\((\\ME_1)\\) can be read as\nimplying that \\(S\\) has an obligation to apply \u201cgreen\u201d to\nall green objects, an obligation that cannot possibly be fulfilled\n(Hattiangadi 2007: 180). One response to this is to endorse the wide\nscope reading,\n \\((\\ME_1 ''')\\),\n since it allows the subject to discharge her obligation by not\nmeaning green by \u201cgreen\u201d\u2014something that\ndoes seem to be in her power. Another response consists in removing\nthe biconditional in \\((\\ME_1)\\), replacing it with a weaker principle\n(Whiting 2007: 137):\n\n\\((\\ME_2)\\)\nFor any speaker \\(S\\), and any time \\(t\\): if \u201cgreen\u201d\nmeans green for \\(S\\) at \\(t\\), then \\(S\\) ought to apply\n\u201cgreen\u201d to an object \\(x\\) only if \\(x\\) is green at\n\\(t\\).\n\n\nThe question has been raised, however, whether \\((\\ME_2)\\) is\nsufficiently strong to support ME normativity. The trouble is that\n\\((\\ME_2)\\) does not seem to place any normative constraints on the\nsubject\u2019s behavior. If \\(x\\) is green, it no longer follows that\n\\(S\\) ought to apply \u201cgreen\u201d to \\(x\\), whereas if \\(x\\) is\nnot green it just follows that it is not the case that \\(S\\) ought to\napply \u201cgreen\u201d to \\(x\\). The latter, it has been stressed,\nis distinct from the claim that \\(S\\) ought not to apply\n\u201cgreen\u201d to \\(x\\)\u2014for instance, it is compatible with\nit being permissible to apply \u201cgreen\u201d to \\(x\\) (Bykvist\n& Hattiangadi 2007: 280). This means that \\((\\ME_2)\\) fails to\nsupport the claim that when \\(S\\) applies a term in a way that is\nsemantically incorrect, then she has done what she ought not do:\n\u201csemantically incorrect\u201d and \u201cought not\u201d thus\ncome apart.\n\nIn response it has been suggested that \u201cought\u201d in (ME1) is\nreplaced by a \u201cmay\u201d. This allows the normativist to retain\nthe biconditional and yet avoid the troubles caused by the principle\nthat ought implies can: That an action is correct\nimplies only that one may do it, not that one is\nobligated to do it, and there is no principle that\nought implies can. If \u201cgreen\u201d is true of\ngreen objects only then \\(S\\) may apply \u201cgreen\u201d to an\nobject if and only if it is green, and this is not in conflict with\nthe fact that the subject is not able to apply \u201cgreen\u201d to\nevery green object there is (Whiting 2009: 544 and 2010: 216; Peregrin\n2012: 88).\n\nThere is therefore some initial unclarity as to precisely which\nprescription is supposed to follow directly from\n (CM).\n A more fundamental question is whether the strategy of the simple\nargument can succeed in the first place. Opponents of ME normativity\ndo not challenge (CM) which, again, seems trivially true. Rather, they\ndeny that (CM) has normative consequences just by itself. The crucial\nclaim here is that \u201ccorrect\u201d can be used both normatively\nand non-normatively (cf. Gl\u00fcer 2001; Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss\n2009: 36; 2015a). If that is true, the simple argument won\u2019t go\nthrough: Rather, an additional premise will be required to the effect\nthat \u201ccorrect\u201d in (CM) is used normatively. And whether or\nnot that premise can be supplied, the argument won\u2019t be direct\n anymore.[12]\n\nAnti-normativists usually go further and claim that the way\n\u201ccorrect\u201d is used in\n (CM)\n in fact is non-normative. What the appeal to correctness conditions\ngives us, it is claimed, is only a way of categorizing applications of\n\u201cgreen\u201d into two basic kinds (the true and the false, for\ninstance), and this does not in itself entail that one ought to apply\nthe term in any particular way. The notion of semantic correctness is\nnon-normative in just this sense: That an application of \\(e\\) is\ncorrect, does not entail that it ought to be made, and, conversely,\nincorrect applications do not immediately imply that \\(S\\) has\nviolated any semantic prescription. If \u201cgreen\u201d means\ngreen then \\(S\\) applying it to a red object implies that her\nstatement is false, but it does not thereby follow that she has failed\nto do what she ought, semantically, to do (Fodor 1990; Horwich 1995;\nGl\u00fcer 1999b; 2001; Wikforss 2001; Dretske 2000; Hattiangadi 2006;\n 2009a).[13]\n[14]\n\nProponents of the direct argument respond by insisting that the notion\nof semantic correctness is a normative notion. To many, this seems a\nsimple conceptual truth holding for the notion of correctness in\ngeneral, and therefore also for that of semantic correctness (Gibbard\n2005: 358; Whiting 2007: 135 and 2009:\n 538).[15]\n Normativists also appeal to ordinary usage here, suggesting that\n\u201ccorrect\u201d is normally used normatively and should\ntherefore be interpreted that way in semantics as well (Whiting 2009:\n538; Peregrin 2012: 84). That hasn\u2019t convinced anti-normativists\nwho point out that dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster\u2019s\ncommonly list normative and non-normative usages for the adjective\n\u201ccorrect\u201d (Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss\n 2015a).[16]\n\nNormativists have also argued that even if the basic semantic concept\nitself wasn\u2019t normative, the notion of semantic correctness\nstill would or could be. Semantic correctness, it is argued, is not\nsimply the same as, for instance, truth. Normativists here appeal to a\ndistinction stressed by Rosen (2001: 620) between correctness and the\n\u201ccorrectness making feature\u201d, the (non-normative) property\nsomething must have in order to count as correct. According to Rosen,\ncorrectness is a higher-order property. To say that something is\ncorrect is not just to say that the correctness making features are in\nplace (as when someone plays the notes of the Moonlight Sonata) but to\nmake the higher-order claim that the action (the piano performance)\npossesses the feature that makes for correctness in acts of that kind\n(the act of playing the Moonlight Sonata). Similarly, it is argued, to\nsay that applying \u201cgreen\u201d to a green object is correct, is\nto say that the application has a certain non-normative property (the\nexpression applies truly) but it is also to make the higher-order\nstatement that the application possesses the feature that makes it\ncorrect in a normative sense. Even if the basic word-world relation is\nnon-normative, therefore, it does not follow that the property of\ncorrectness does not have a normative dimension (Speaks 2009: 408;\nWhiting 2009: 540; Fennell 2013: 58\u201359). It is difficult to see,\nhowever, how something like \u201cthe correctness making\nfeature\u201d could strictly speaking be a second-order property\n(i.e., a property of a property). It is one and the same object that\nboth has the correctness making feature and is correct, after all.\nRather, Rosen-style correctness is a first-order, second-level\nproperty (to use the terminology of Russell\u2019s ramified theory of\ntypes). More importantly, even if that is the best way to construe the\nintuitive general notion of correctness, all this means is that it\nmight be possible to provide arguments for the claim that the notion\nof semantic correctness is normative even if we agree that the basic\nsemantic concept itself is not normative. But the basic\nanti-normativist challenge applies to Rosen-style correctness just as\nto any other construal of the intuitive, general notion of\ncorrectness: Since \u201ccorrect\u201d can be used normatively and\nnon-normatively, there is no simple, direct implication from\ncorrectness to normativity (cf. Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss 2009: 37,\nfn. 10; 2015a).\n\nThis strand in the debate might seem to suggest that behind the\ndiscussion of the simple argument lies nothing but a basic clash of\nintuitions. The anti-normativist denies what the normativist\nasserts\u2014that the concept of semantic correctness is an\nessentially normative concept. A possible conclusion, therefore, is\nthat the normativist and the anti-normativist operate with different\nconcepts of semantic correctness. This raises the question, however,\nwhether there is nevertheless co-extensionality between the two\nconcepts. As long as\n (CM)\n is the common starting point this would seem to be the case; any\nsorting effected by the normative distinction between correctness and\nincorrectness will coincide with the sorting effected by the\nnon-normative distinction. If so, it would seem that further arguments\nare required to resolve the dispute, beyond the appeal to intuitions:\nThe normativist would have to provide some reasons why the\nnon-normativist notion of correctness is not a notion of semantic\ncorrectness. This poses a special challenge to normativists who appeal\nto Rosen\u2019s distinction and grant that the basic semantic\nrelation is non-normative: If this relation is non-normative then the\nquestion is not whether the concept of semantic correctness\ncould be given a normative construal but whether semantics\nneeds such a construal (Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss 2015a).\n\nAnother strand in the discussion of the simple argument concerns the\nstatus of the relevant semantic obligations. Here it is often\nemphasized that semantic obligations are merely prima facie\nand may be overridden by other obligations, such as the obligation (in\na certain context) to tell a lie. It is therefore not an objection to\nME normativity that there are situations in which \u201cgreen\u201d\nmeans green for \\(S\\), without it being the case that \\(S\\)\nought to apply \u201cgreen\u201d to green objects only (Whiting\n2007: 139 and 2009: 546).\n\nThis appeal to prima facie obligations has been challenged.\nWhat is distinctive of a prima facie obligation, as opposed\nto a mere instrumental means-end imperative, is that it cannot be\noverridden by mere desires. However, it is argued, if \\(S\\) has no\ndesire to speak the truth, then \\(S\\) has no obligation to apply\n\u201cgreen\u201d to green objects. For instance, if neither \\(S\\),\nnor her audience, care whether \\(S\\) tells the truth, then there is no\nobligation to apply \u201cgreen\u201d correctly. Hence,\n (CM)\n does not even yield prima facie obligations (Hattiangadi\n2006: 232 and 2007:189). In response, the normativists suggest that in\nsuch a situation the speaker\u2019s use would nevertheless be\nsemantically incorrect and involve a violation of her semantic\nobligations. The violation would not be very serious, but it would\nstill be a violation (Whiting 2007: 139). This has been challenged,\ntoo. Verheggen, for instance, argues that Whiting\u2019s attempt to\nback this up by the possibility of criticising a speaker who\nmisapplies an expression out of mere desire is not convincing. After\nall, the speaker acts as she does precisely because of what she means\nby the expression\u2014therefore, there is no semantic reason to\ncriticize her (Verheggen 2011: 562).\n\nNevertheless, it would be hasty to conclude that nothing but\ninstrumental norms can be derived from meaning facts in conjunction\nwith desires. As noted above, it is clear that an appeal to merely\ninstrumental norms, or means-ends norms, fails to support the idea\nthat meaning is essentially normative. Although facts about\ncorrectness conditions may play a role in the generation of\ninstrumental norms such as \u201cIf you wish to communicate with ease\nyou ought to apply \u2018green\u2019 to \\(x\\) if and only if \\(x\\)\nis green\u201d, the ought in question derives from the agent\u2019s\ndesires and intentions (given certain empirical facts, regularities,\nor laws), not from the correctness conditions themselves. Indeed, very\nmany facts can play a role in the generation of instrumental norms\nwithout thereby being intrinsically normative\u2014for instance,\ngiven the laws of nature, facts about the weather, taken together with\nfacts about my desires, have implications for how I should dress\n(Coates 1986; Bilgrami 1993; Gl\u00fcer 2001; Wikforss 2001;\nHattiangadi 2006, 2009b). Not all hypothetical norms are\ninstrumental, or based on contingent means-ends relations, however. An\nexample would be the following: If you want to castle in chess, you\nshould (or indeed: must) move your king and one of your rooks in a\ncertain way. Similarly, it has been suggested that there is an\nimportant difference between hypothetical norms involving ordinary\nnon-normative facts (such as facts about the weather) and norms\ninvolving meaning facts: Since meaning facts are constituted\nby correctness conditions, meaning facts always dictate how I\nshould behave when I intend to produce a meaningful utterance. Even\nthough what they dictate depends on my particular desires in\nthe situation, the fact that they dictate something does not\ndepend on any desire\u2014in contrast to the dictates derivable from\nweather facts (Verheggen 2011: 563). One might wonder, though, whether\nthe cases ultimately really are disanalogous: Just as one might not\ncare whether one gets wet or stays dry, it might seem, one might just\nnot care whether what one says is semantically correct or not\u2014do\ncorrectness conditions really dictate anything if all I want to do is\nsay something\n meaningful?[17]\n\nIt is worth, in this context, to comment on the relation between\nKripke\u2019s normativity constraint and the so called \u201cproblem\nof error\u201d. As noted above, Kripke takes his normativity\nconstraint to rule out dispositionalist accounts of meaning. Although\nhe formulates his objection to dispositionalism in various ways (1982:\n29\u201337), in the debate the main focus has been on the question\nwhether the dispositionalist can account for the possibility of\nmistake or error. For an expression meaning green, for\ninstance, it is just as much a platitude that mistaken or erroneous\napplication is (in principle) possible as that the expression has\ncorrectness conditions. The question, then, is the following: If\nmeaning is determined by how \\(S\\) is disposed to use her term, then\nhow could she use the term incorrectly? It has been argued that she\ncouldn\u2019t\u2014rather, every apparent error would just indicate\na difference in meaning (Boghossian 1989a:\n 537\u2013540).[18]\n It is much disputed whether the dispositionalist can solve this\nproblem. It should be noted, however, that the problem of error does\nnot seem to have much to do with semantic normativity (Fodor 1990:\n135\u2013136; Bilgrami 1992; Wikforss 2001: 208; Hattiangadi 2006:\n229; 2007: 186). The error objection does not turn on the fact that\nthe dispositionalist cannot allow for semantic oughts but, rather, on\nthe fact that we must not construe the relation between the meaning\ndetermining facts and meaning in such a way that mistake is ruled\nout.\n\nOf course, even provided with a solution to the problem of error\ndispositionalism might come to grief with Kripke\u2019s skeptic.\nSolving the problem of error requires showing that there is a\nplausible principle \\(P\\) assigning meanings to expressions on the\nbasis of the speaker\u2019s dispositions to use them, a principle\nunderwriting plausible ascriptions of error. On a quite plausible\ninterpretation of the skeptic\u2019s main strategy\u2014i.e., that\nof \u201cquussing\u201d candidate facts\u2014this strategy is as\napplicable here as elsewhere. If, for instance, \\(P\\) assigns\naddition to \u201cplus\u201d on the basis of disposition\n\\(D\\), the skeptic will want to know why this is the right\nprinciple\u2014as opposed to some other principle \\(P'\\) assigning\nquaddition to \u201cplus\u201d on the basis of \\(D\\). As\nthe mere fact of the speaker\u2019s having \\(D\\) does nothing to\ndetermine which of these principles is the right one, dispositional\nfacts are as quussable as any of the other candidates\u2014and this\nremains the case even if your dispositionalism comes with a plausible\nprinciple of meaning determination (cf. Pagin 2002:\n 160f).[19]\n2.1.2 Using an Expression in Accordance with its Meaning\n\nAn alternative to the simple argument is to suggest that there is a\nfurther notion of semantic correctness, one that is not co-extensional\nwith that of\n (CM)\n but that is both essential to meaning and normative. Thus, it has\nbeen claimed that there is a crucial ambiguity in the notion of\ncorrect use (Millar 2004: 160). On the one hand, there is the notion\nof semantic correctness as in (CM); on the other hand there is the\nnotion of correct use as in \u201cusing an expression in accordance\nwith its meaning\u201d. That the two do not coincide is clear from\nthe fact that one may use an expression in accordance with its\nmeaning, and yet make a false statement, as when one has a false\nbelief about the world (McGinn 1984; Millar 2002; 2004: 160\u2013175;\nMoore 1954/1955: 308; Sellars 1956: 166; Buleandra 2008: 180; Fennell\n2013: 69, Reiland forthcominga). We must distinguish empirical\nmistakes from linguistic mistakes, it is argued, and it is\nessential that we are able to allow for both. Moreover, it is said,\nthis further notion of semantic correctness is an essentially\nnormative notion, one that has implications for what \\(S\\) ought to do\nor is obligated to do: if \u201cgreen\u201d means green for\n\\(S\\), then \\(S\\) ought to use \u201cgreen\u201d in accordance with\nits meaning. (This idea, too, goes back to Kripke who, at points,\nspeaks of what I should do, if my use of the term is to be \u201cin\naccordance with how it was meant\u201d (1982: 30, 37).)\n\nHow is the notion of \u201cusing an expression in accordance with its\nmeaning\u201d to be construed? According to one proposal, it concerns\nwhich expressions are \u201cappropriate\u201d or\n\u201csuitable\u201d for expressing a certain belief. The notion of\n\u201csuitability\u201d, in turn, is derived from the ordinary\nsemantic correctness conditions taken together with what I intend to\nexpress by my expressions: If \u201cgreen\u201d applies correctly\nonly to green objects, and I mean to express my belief that \\(x\\) is\ngreen, then I ought to use the term \u201cgreen\u201d and not, say,\n\u201cred\u201d. This allows for the possibility that my use is\ncorrect in the sense of\n (CM),\n and yet linguistically incorrect (if \\(x\\) is red and I use the term\n\u201cred\u201d to express my belief that \\(x\\) is green); and, vice\nversa, that my use is incorrect in the sense of (CM), but\nlinguistically correct (if \\(x\\) is red and I use the term\n\u201cgreen\u201d to express my belief that \\(x\\) is green) (McGinn\n1984: 60; Millar 2004: 162\u2013163). Hence, in the place of (CM) we\nhave:\n\n(CM*)\nFor any speaker \\(S\\), and any time \\(t\\): if \u201cgreen\u201d\nmeans green for \\(S\\) at \\(t\\), then it is correct for \\(S\\)\nat \\(t\\) to apply \u201cgreen\u201d to an object \\(x\\) iff \\(S\\)\nintends to express the belief that \\(x\\) is green at\n \\(t\\).[20]\n\n\nPossible misuses are said to include both performance errors (such as\nslips of the tongue) and so-called meaning errors (as when the speaker\nthinks \u201carcane\u201d means ancient) (Millar 2004:\n163).\n\nThis raises the question of what motivates this further notion of\ncorrectness. While it is a platitude that meaningful expressions have\nsemantic correctness conditions, it is not a platitude that an\nexpression is meaningful only if there are these further correctness\nconditions. If \u201cgreen\u201d means green for \\(S\\), and\n\\(S\\) uses \u201cred\u201d to express her belief that \\(x\\) is\ngreen, she may fail in her communicative intentions (although not\nnecessarily, consider the use of irony and metaphor), but does it\nfollow that she has used her expressions incorrectly in a semantically\nrelevant sense? The added notion of correctness, it may therefore be\nargued, simply does no semantic work. This concern has been raised by\nsome normativists as well. For instance, Whiting (2016) argues that it\nis a mistake to try to defend normativism on these grounds, and that\nthe normativist should stick to the orthodox interpretation that takes\nas its starting point\n (CM).\n\nIn the literature, the most common route to the conclusion that we\nneed some such further notion of semantic correctness goes via\nassumptions about the nature of understanding (Wright 1980:\n20; McDowell 1984; McGinn 1984:109; Kot\u0313\u00e1tko 1998; Millar\n2004; Buleandra 2008; Fennell 2012). Understanding the meaning of a\nterm, it is argued, involves using it in accordance with its meaning\nand, moreover, feeling obligated to thus using it. To learn the\nmeaning of an expression, McDowell writes for instance,\n\n\nis to acquire an understanding that obliges us subsequently \u2026\nto judge and speak in certain determinate ways, on pain of failure to\nobey the dictates of the meaning we have grasped. (1984: 45)\n\n\nThis motivates the appeal to further correctness conditions, it is\nheld, since a speaker may fully understand a term while using it in a\nfalse judgment and, conversely, use the term in a true judgment while\nfailing to understand the term properly.\n\nThe route via understanding depends on assumptions about the nature of\nlinguistic understanding that may be challenged. Thus, Timothy\nWilliamson has argued that there are no understanding-assent links of\nthe relevant sort, thereby rejecting the assumption that understanding\nthe meaning of an expression \\(e\\) involves using \\(e\\) in certain\nways (Williamson 2007). However, even if this assumption is accepted,\nit is a further supposition that this brings with it any semantic\nobligations. First, it might be held that the link between\nunderstanding and use is constitutive, and that all that follows if\n\\(S\\) fails to use e in accordance with a certain meaning \\(M\\), is\nthat e does not mean \\(M\\). For instance, if a speaker (regularly)\nuses \u201carcane\u201d in accordance with the standard meaning of\n\u201cancient\u201d, then \u201carcane\u201d means\nancient and not\n arcane.[21]\n Second, as in the case of the simple argument, it could be argued\nthat the appearance of an ought here derives from added normative\nprinciples, such as instrumental norms concerning the ease of\ncommunication, or pragmatic norms regulating speech\n acts.[22]\n\nIn response it has been suggested that the relevant normative\nconsequences should not be understood in terms of obligations but,\nrather, in terms of commitments. This is the line taken by Alan Millar\n(2002 and 2004). Meaning statements, such as\n\u201c\u2018Green\u2019 means green\u201d, Millar argues,\nare true in virtue of there being a rule-governed practice. If \\(S\\)\nuses \u201cgreen\u201d to mean green, therefore, she becomes a\nparticipant in this practice and incurs a commitment to use the term\naccordingly. To be properly committed, Millar suggests, \\(S\\) has to\nbe disposed to adjust her use if she discovers that it is not in\nkeeping with the meaning of the expression (as when \\(S\\) uses\n\u201carcane\u201d to mean ancient). The commitment is not\ndependent on one\u2019s desire to communicate, or on the intention to\nspeak the truth, but merely on \\(S\\) participating in the practice of\nusing \u201cgreen\u201d with a certain meaning. However, Millar\nstresses, it does not follow that she ought to use her expressions a\ncertain way, since it does not follow that she ought to participate in\nthe practice\u2014there may be reasons to withdraw from the practice\ninstead. Hence, one may participate in a practice without it following\nthat one ought to \u201ccarry out the performances associated with\none\u2019s role\u201d (Millar 2004:\n 173).[23]\n\nThis proposal illustrates how ME normativity might be derived from MD\nnormativity: Meaning statements have normative consequences, according\nto Millar, because meaning is determined by the speaker following\ncertain rules. Metaphysically the rules come first and make meaning\npossible. Before turning to a discussion of MD normativity, let us\nbriefly consider some other arguments put forth in support of ME\nnormativity.\n2.1.3 Alternative Arguments\n\nThe arguments above are all attempts to show that meaning statements\nhave normative implications. An alternative strategy is to suggest\nthat meaning statements simply are prescriptions. When we\nstate \u201c\u2018Green\u2019 means green\u201d we may\nappear to be making a descriptive statement whereas, in fact, we are\nprescribing how \u201cgreen\u201d ought to be used (Gauker\n2007, 2011; Lance & O\u2019Leary Hawthorne 1997; Peregrin 2012:\n96; Gibbard 2012). This proposal can either be construed as a claim\nabout the semantic content of meaning statements, or as a\nclaim about the typical use of meaning statements. Thus, a\nstatement may be used prescriptively, while having a descriptive,\nfactual content (\u201cIn this classroom we raise our hands before\nspeaking\u201d).\n\nIf the suggestion is that meaning statements have a prescriptive\ncontent it would provide another very direct argument in support of ME\nnormativity, one that does not have to proceed via the controversial\nclaim that the notion of semantic correctness is an essentially\nnormative notion. This is an advantage over the simple argument.\nHowever, there are also disadvantages. For instance, the question\narises whether the claim that meaning statements lack descriptive\ncontent can accommodate the role of such statements in inferential\ncontexts (see Gauker 2007: 194\u2013195 for a discussion). Another\nquestion concerns the implications from \u201cought\u201d-statements\nto meaning statements. According to the simple argument,\n\u201c\u2018Green\u2019 ought to be applied to \\(x\\) if and only if\n\\(x\\) is green\u201d follows immediately from\n\u201c\u2018Green\u2019 means green\u201d. According to\nthis argument the converse also holds: \u201c\u2018Green\u2019\nmeans green\u201d follows directly from\n\u201c\u2018Green\u2019 ought to be applied to \\(x\\) if and only if\n\\(x\\) is green\u201d (cf. Gibbard 2012: 12 and 113\u2013115). The\nlatter has been questioned on the grounds that even if it is true that\n\u201cgreen\u201d ought to be applied this way, the\n\u201cought\u201d in question may not have anything to do with\nsemantics but, say, with religious practices (Byrne 2002: 207).\n\nThese difficulties are avoided if, instead, meaning statements are\nsimply construed as having a prescriptive use (while having a\ndescriptive content). On either construal, however, the question\narises why we should believe that meaning statements are prescriptive.\nOne suggestion is that the prescriptive function of meaning statements\nfollows from their role in coordinating our linguistic use (Gauker\n2007 and 2012: 279). Meaning statements are proposals about how terms\nought to be used, and as such they serve to determine meaning\nand remove an otherwise irresolvable indeterminacy (see also Gibbard\n2012: 109\u2013112). As a result, \u201cwe all think of meanings as\nstandards that we are obliged to conform to\u201d (Gauker 2007: 185).\nThis defense of the normativity thesis therefore turns on\ncontroversial issues concerning indeterminacy. Another proposal shuns\nthe metaphysical questions concerning the nature of meaning and\nappeals to the function of meaning statements in our\npractices (Lance & O\u2019Leary Hawthorne 1997). Instead of\nasking for the facts that constitute meaning, it is argued, we should\nconsider the role of meaning statements in our socio-linguistic\npractices. It then emerges that such statements serve the regulative\nfunction of licensing and censoring certain uses. It should be noted\nthat unless this proposal about the function of meaning statements is\nsaid to have some metaphysical implications concerning the\nnature of meaning, it will fall short of supporting the claim that\nmeaning is essentially\n normative.[24]\n[25]\n\nIn addition, there are a variety of other arguments in support of ME\nnormativity. One such argument grants that correctness conditions are\nnot themselves normative, but suggests that we derive the normativity\nof meaning from the idea that we ought to speak the truth (Ebbs 1997;\nHaugeland 1998: Soames 1997: 221, 224). As noted above, this only\nsucceeds if the obligation in question can be said to derive purely\nfrom semantic sources. The question, then, is whether there is any\nreason to suppose that we have a semantic obligation to speak the\ntruth. The impression that there is, it has been suggested, is a\nresult of a conflation of semantics and pragmatics. Thus, it is\ncommonly held that there are rules of assertion, and some of these are\nsuch that they are violated when the speaker makes a false judgment.\nFor instance, it has been proposed that there is a \u201cknowledge\nrule\u201d: \u201cOne must: assert \\(p\\) only if one knows\n\\(p\\)\u201d (Williamson 2000: 242). However, opponents of ME\nnormativity stress, these are pragmatic rules, regulating the\nperformance of speech acts, not semantic ones. If such rules are\nessential for the possibility of assertion, then assertion is\nessentially normative, but it does not follow that meaning is\n(Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss 2009: 37\u201338; Speaks 2009). For\ndiscussion of the claim that assertion is normative, see the entry on\n assertion,\n for a suggestion as to how to connect norms of assertion to the\nmeanings of sentences by means of the Alstonian idea of meanings as\nspeech-act-potentials (Alston 2000), see Garc\u00eda-Carpintero\n2012, 2021.\n\nAnother set of arguments reject the focus on correctness conditions\nand appeal to other aspects of Kripke\u2019s normativity objection to\ndispositionalist theories. For instance, it has been suggested that\nthe claim that meaning is essentially normative is primarily a claim\nabout the justificatory role of meaning. Facts about meaning are,\nessentially, such that they are able to justify \\(S\\)\u2018s use of\nher terms, able to guide \\(S\\)\u2018s usage. In this sense, meaning\nfacts are like prescriptive rules, such as the rules of\netiquette\u2014it is of their essence that they guide action or give\ndirections. The reason dispositionalism fails, then, is not that the\ndispositionalist cannot account for error, but that facts about what I\nam disposed to do are not essentially capable of justifying (Gampel\n1997: 225\u2013231; Zalabardo 1997: 480\u2013483; Kusch 2006:\n50\u201394).\n\nWhether this argument succeeds depends on whether it can be shown that\nthe role of meaning in motivating action is equivalent to that of\nprescriptions. Thus, the fact that \u201cgreen\u201d means\ngreen may of course guide the speaker\u2019s actions in the\nsense that any facts do so\u2014i.e., if \\(S\\) believes that\n\u201cgreen\u201d means green. To show that meaning facts\nplay a normatively guiding role, therefore, it does not suffice to\nappeal to the idea that meaning facts play a role in motivating\naction; it also has to be shown that the motivating role is that of a\nprescription rather than a belief (see\n section 2.2\n below).[26]\n\nIn the discussion of ME normativity so far it is assumed that the\nrelevant norms are norms for action, prescriptions for the\nspeaker\u2019s use of her expressions. This, again, is how Kripke\ndiscusses the topic and how those writing on Kripke tend to construe\nthe relevant normativity. However, as far as ME normativity goes,\nnormative consequences might also be construed axiologically. Thus, it\nmight be argued that semantically correct applications, by themselves,\nare valuable. This, too, would show that meaning is an\nessentially normative notion, although in a different sense than the\nstandard one. And in this case too, the crucial question would be\nwhether the step from\n (CM)\n to normative consequences can be motivated. Does sorting\n\\(S\\)\u2019s applications into the semantically correct and the\nsemantically incorrect ones, by itself imply that actions of one or\nthe other of these kinds are valuable (Gl\u00fcer 2001:\n 60\u201361)?[27]\n\nAnother option would be to construe the rules or norms of meaning as\nconstitutive ones (cf.\n section 1.2\n above). Rules of meaning, the idea would be, are rules for the use of\nexpressions that determine the meaning of these expressions. Appealing\nto constitutive rules thus would mean accepting what we call MD\nnormativism: It would mean accepting that expressions have meaning\nbecause there are rules or norms in force for their use.\n2.2 Meaning Determining Normativity\n\nMeaning determining normativism (MD normativism) is the claim that\nmeaning is essentially such that it is (at least partially) determined\nby norms. This is a claim in the metaphysics of meaning, more\nprecisely, in \u201cfoundational semantics\u201d (Stalnaker 1997:\n535). It is an answer to the question in virtue of what\nlinguistic expressions have their meanings: Linguistic expressions\ncannot have meanings without norms, and the norms come first in the\norder of metaphysical determination or explanation. Normative facts,\nif you will, (at least partially) \u201cground\u201d meaning\n facts.[28]\n[29] Strong versions of MD normativism hold that\nMD norms also determine which meanings the expressions\ngoverned by them have.\n\nInitial motivation for MD normativism is furnished by the arbitrary,\ncontingent, and \u201cman-made\u201d nature of the connection\nbetween linguistic expressions and their meanings. Observed by\nphilosophers since ancient times, the nature of this connection\nsuggests that it might be established by convention. But\nplausible as such conventionalism might seem, earlier discussions have\nshown it to be quite controversial (cf. Davidson 1984a; Dummett 1986).\nIf conventions are to play a role in an informative account of\nmeaning, we cannot simply claim that it, for instance, is a convention\nof English that \u201cgreen\u201d means green. Rather, the relevant\nconventions would need to be specified in non-semantic terms (cf.\nDavidson 1984a; Gl\u00fcer 2013).\n\nMoreover, the relation between conventionalism and MD normativism is\ncomplicated. On David Lewis\u2019s influential account, for instance,\na convention is a regularity in the behavior of a community which is\narbitrary but perpetuates itself because it serves\n\n\nsome sort of common purpose. Past conformity breeds future conformity\nbecause it gives one a reason to go on conforming. (Lewis 1975: 4)\n\n\nArguably, a Lewisian convention is not normative; it does, for\ninstance, not seem to require any prescription to conform being in\nforce in the community. Yet another question concerns the requirement\nof regularity. Even if regularity of use were required for meaning\n(Davidson famously disputed this; cf. Davidson 1984a; 1986b), such\nregularity might not need to be due to either norm or convention. A\nrelevant observation here is that people, upon reflection, usually can\nprovide at least rough formulations of the rules or conventions they\nare following and cite them as reasons for their actions. But when it\ncomes to the semantic rules of natural language, this is far from\nbeing the case; the question would be why.\n\nThe connection between meaning and use provides another\nstarting point for MD normativism, the thought being that it is not\nhow we are disposed to use an expression that determines its\nmeaning, but how we are supposed to use it (cf. Glock 2000;\nBrandom 1994: 159). The most common form of MD normativism thus holds\nthat the meanings of linguistic expressions are (at least partially)\ndetermined by rules for their use. At a minimum, such MD\nnormativism claims that the following is an essential truth about\nmeaning, or more precisely about a linguistic expression \\(e\\)\u2019s\nhaving a meaning \\(M\\) (for a speaker, or group of speakers, \\(S\\) at\na time \\(t)\\):\n\n\\((\\MD_R)\\)\n\\(e\\) means \\(M\\) for \\(S\\) at \\(t\\) only if there is a rule \\(R\\)\nfor the use of \\(e\\) in force for \\(S\\) at\n \\(t\\).[30]\n\n\nThis idea was famously formulated by Ludwig Wittgenstein, who wrote in\nhis so-called \u201cMiddle Period\u201d:\n\n[W]ithout these rules the word has as yet no meaning; and if we change\nthe rules, it now has another meaning (or none), and in that case we\nmay just as well change the word, too. (PG 133)\n\n\nIt is quite plausible to read Wittgenstein as here espousing a strong\nversion of MD normativism.\n\n\\((\\MD_R)\\) is compatible with claiming that meaning is\nsolely a matter of the norms or rules governing the use of\nlinguistic expressions, no matter how they are actually used\n(e.g., Hlobil 2015), but MD normativism can take less radical forms,\ntoo. One might for instance think that speakers\u2019 dispositions to\nuse expressions do play a role in meaning determination, but argue\nthat only a certain kind of disposition is relevant, a kind that can\nonly be specified by means of its normative properties. In this vein,\nWedgwood argues more generally that it is only \u201crational\u201d\ndispositions that determine intentional content (where rationality is\ntaken to be a normative property; cf. Wedgwood 2007: 167ff; 2009).\nNormative teleosemantics can be construed as making a similar move:\nHere, it is those dispositions realizing the biological function of\nthe mechanism of using an expression that determine meaning (where\nbiological functions are taken to be something normative; cf. Millikan\n1990, Neander 1995).\n\nOne might also think that meaning is determined on a non-normative\nbasis, but by a normative principle. Davidson (1970) famously used the\nclaim that meaning and intentional content are determined by the\n\u201cprinciple of charity\u201d to argue for a kind of\nnon-reductive naturalism. According to Davidson, speakers essentially\nare by and large rational and beliefs by their nature\n\u201cveridical\u201d, i.e., by and large true (Davidson 1986a).\nAccording to the principle of charity, the best interpretation of a\nspeaker \\(S\\) therefore optimises overall coherence, or rationality,\nand truth across \\(S\\)\u2019s utterances, propositional attitudes,\nand intentional actions (e.g., Davidson 1973, 1974, 1991; see also\nGl\u00fcer 2011: ch. 3). Because of its appeal to rationality, the\nprinciple of charity has been interpreted as a normative principle,\nand Davidson as a normativist (see for instance, McDowell 1984;\nHornsby 1997: 87; Gampel 1997; Hurley 1998: 5; Glock 2000; Jackman\n2004\n [Other Internet Resources];\n Wedgwood 2007: 161ff; Kriegel 2010; Liebesman 2018). This is\ncontroversial, however; it has been argued that its constitutive role\nin fact prevents the principle of charity from being normative: It\ndetermines what meaningful utterances (contentful mental states)\nare, not how anything should be or what anyone\nshould do (cf. Gl\u00fcer 2001; Wikforss 2001; Schroeder\n2003; Engel 2007: 187ff; for a different argument, see Bilgrami 1992:\n102ff.). Quite independently, the claim that rationality is\nessentially normative is of course itself controversial (cf.\nSchn\u00e4delbach 1990; Kolodny 2005; Broome 2007; Gl\u00fcer &\nWikforss 2013a, 2018).\n\nOther influential ideas behind MD normativism include\nWittgenstein-inspired skepticism towards meanings as \u201cPlatonic\nentities\u201d; in this tradition, meanings and concepts themselves\nare construed as products of our norms or conventions (cf. for\ninstance, Baker & Hacker 1985: 269ff). Another idea derives from\nmeaning\u2019s psychological role: It has been argued that, since\ncompetent speakers are guided in their use of expressions by the\nknowledge of their meanings, a knowledge that is general in form, such\nguidance must be construed as guidance by rules (cf., for instance,\nBoghossian 2008: 489).\n\nIn the next two sections we shall look a little closer at\n\\((\\MD_R)\\).\n2.2.1 Meaning Determining Rules or Norms\n\nAssume that meaning is determined by rules. How exactly does this\nwork? What kind of rule could do this job? What does it mean for such\nrules to be \u201cin force\u201d for a speaker or group of speakers,\nand in what relation do such rules stand to the actual use of the\nexpressions they govern?\n\nQuite clearly, meaning determining rules would be constitutive\nrules (see\n section 1.2\n above). Typically, they are taken to determine not only that\nexpressions have meaning, but also which meanings they have.\nA rule \\(R\\) governing the use of an expression \\(e\\), the thought is,\ndivides possible uses of \\(e\\) into those that accord with R\nand those that do not. On the assumption that the former are\nthe semantically correct uses of \\(e, \\ R\\) thus endows \\(e\\)\nwith semantic correctness conditions, i.e., meaning. Ideas like this\nare drawn on by a great number of philosophers, including Wittgenstein\nscholars such as Baker and Hacker or Glock, as well as philosophers\nsuch as von Wright, Sellars, and Searle.\n\nStill, the question is how this exactly works. Constitutive rules\n\u201ccreate\u201d new kinds of action. Actions of these kinds are\nsuch that they cannot be performed if the rules are not in force.\nSearle suggested that such rules typically can be brought into the\nfollowing form:\n\n(CR)\nIn \\(C\\), doing \\(X\\) counts as doing \\(Y\\).\n\n\nHe also suggested that meaning is determined by such rules (1969:\n42ff). But it is not easy to see how rules of form\n (CR)\n would endow expressions with semantic correctness conditions (cf.\nGl\u00fcer & Pagin\n 1998).[31]\n\nIt might be more promising to allow meaning determining rules to be\nprescriptions (or proscriptions), endowing expressions with meanings\nby distinguishing between semantically correct (pre- or proscribed)\nand incorrect (forbidden) uses. They would be constitutive in the\nsense of its being impossible to meaningfully use the expressions they\ngovern without their being in force for the speaker (cf. Gl\u00fcer\n& Pagin 1998; Kiesselbach 2014; Hlobil 2015; Reiland\nforthcominga).\n\nWhat, then, does it mean for a meaning determining rule \\(R\\) to be in\nforce for a speaker \\(S\\)\u2019s use of an expression \\(e\\) (at a\ntime \\(t)\\)? Broadly, there are three main options for the MD\nnormativist. According to the first, using \\(e\\) (at \\(t)\\) has to be\nmotivated by or to follow \\(R\\) in the sense of\nattempting to do what is in accordance with \\(R\\). On the second\nconstrual, \\(S\\) has to accept R in some sense not requiring\n(all) particular uses of \\(e\\) to be motivated by \\(R\\). Both of these\nwould plausibly seem to require \\(S\\) to have certain intentional\nstates. But, third, \\(R\\)\u2019s being in force for \\(S\\) could also\nbe construed as independent of any of \\(S\\)\u2019s intentional states\n(with respect to \\(R)\\).\n\nThe laws of the state, for instance, would seem to fall into the third\ncategory; they are in force even for those individual citizens who do\nnot accept them. Analogously, one might claim meaning determining\nrules to be in force in a speech community quite independently of any\n(or even all) of its member\u2019s acceptance of, or attitudes\ntowards, them. Construing MD (or CD) normativism along these lines has\nrecently gained some proponents (e.g., Tracy 2020; Hlobil 2015). Many\ngames are in the second category; they are such that even though\nparticipation requires players to accept their rules, participants\nnevertheless can intentionally violate these very rules within the\ngame. For instance, intentional spearing does occur in ice hockey\ngames, and will be punished precisely because the rule against\nspearing is in force even for players who spear intentionally. Again,\nin semantics the situation might seem analogous: Speakers can\nintentionally say semantically incorrect things without their\nexpressions losing or changing their meanings (cf. Railton 2000;\nGl\u00fcer & Pagin 1998; Gl\u00fcer 1999b; 2001; Wikforss 2001,\nKiesselbach 2014, Reiland 2020;\n forthcomingb).[32]\n\nThe most common and traditional idea, however, is that expressions\n\u201cget\u201d their meanings by speakers\u2019 following the\nrules for their use (see, for instance, Baker & Hacker 1985:\n154ff; Glock 1996a: 323ff); speaking meaningfully is conceived of as a\nform of rule-guided action. Let\u2019s call this form of MD\nnormativism \u201cguidance\n normativism\u201d.[33]\n\nA crucial question for guidance normativism concerns the distinction\nbetween rule guided and merely regular behavior. As\nQuine classically noted, on pain of vicious regress, meaning\ndetermining rules or conventions cannot be explicitly and deliberately\nadopted; they must somehow be \u201cimplicit\u201d in the behavior\nof speakers. But then, Quine argued, we risk depriving the notion of a\nlinguistic rule \u201cof any explanatory force and reducing it to an\nidle label\u201d (Quine 1935 [1976: 106]). We shall look at this\nissue in the next section.\n2.2.3 Guidance by Meaning Determining Rules\n\nIt is quite natural to think that behavior guided by an (implicit or\nexplicit) rule \\(R\\) is behavior that can be explained by\nmeans of \\(R\\). More precisely, many philosophers think, the\nexplanation needs to be a reasons-explanation. Therefore, the\nthought is, there is an \u201cintentional condition\u201d on\nrule-guidance, requiring, for instance, intentions to follow \\(R\\)\n(e.g., Baker & Hacker 1985: 155; Glock 1996a: 325), or some other\nstate of accepting or internalizing \\(R\\) (Boghossian\n 2008).[34]\n\nIf there is an intentional condition, even guidance by implicit rules\nwould seem to require prior mental states with intentional content. A\nmuch-discussed question is whether this leads back into vicious\nregress. This question would seem to arise not only for those who\nthink that thought depends on language, or that thought and language\nare interdependent, but also for any kind of guidance normativism\nabout mental content (cf. Boghossian 1989a; 2008). For instance, if\nhaving a contentful intentional state is itself a matter of being\nguided by a content determining rule, then another intentional state\nis required for having the first one, and so on ad\n infinitum.[35]\n It has therefore been argued that according to Wittgenstein there\nmust be a basic form of rule following that is not subject to any\nintentional condition, but \u201cblind\u201d (Wright 2007; see also\nGarc\u00eda-Carpintero 2012). Alternatively, it has been argued that\ntherefore the late Wittgenstein did not conceive of meaningful use of\nlanguage as rule guided anymore (Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss 2010a).\nBoghossian (2008: 493f) provides an independent, general argument\nagainst an intentional condition on rule guidance. He argues that the\nrelevant intentional state would be a state with general\n(prescriptive) content, and that acting under particular circumstances\non an intentional state with general content always involves some sort\nof inference. Inference itself, however, essentially involves\nfollowing a rule, and thus a regress\u2014reminiscent of that\nfamiliar from Lewis Carroll (1895)\u2014ensues. In response, the\nassumption that inference is essentially rule guided has been\nquestioned (cf. Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss 2010a). Miller (2015) offers\na different response; he contends that Wittgensteinian\n\u201cblindness\u201d does not amount to giving up on the\nintentional condition, but to denying that application of a general\nrule to a particular case involves inference. Blind rule-following,\nMiller suggests, is to be construed in terms of a causal connection\nbetween rule-acceptance and application, where the former causes the\nlatter \u201cin the right kind of way\u201d (2015:\n 411ff).[36]\n\nTogether with the observation recorded earlier\u2014that speakers do\nnot usually seem to be able to formulate semantic rules or to cite\nthem as reasons\u2014some philosophers have looked for alternative\nways of understanding the explanatory power of meaning determining\nrules, for instance in terms of evolution. Ideas here range from using\nevolutionary explanation as a mere analogy (as in Sellars 1954 or\nSearle\n 1995)[37]\n to normative construals of the idea of a biological function in\nnormative teleosemantics (cf., e.g., Jarvis 2012), possibly in\ncombination with computational ideas about sub-personal rule following\nat the level of mental representation (cf. Jacob 2005: 200f;\nGarc\u00eda-Carpintero 2012; for some critical discussion Boghossian\n2008). There is a worry, though, that the basic question recurs: What\ndistinguishes a sub-personal regularity from a performance governed by\na sub-personal\n rule?[38]\n2.2.4 Primitive Normativity\n\nGinsborg (2011a,b; 2012; 2018a,b; 2020; forthcoming) suggests that the\nnormativity of meaning can be defended by interpreting the relevant\n\u201cought\u201d and distinguishing normativity and regularity in a\nway that is quite radically different from the dominant view in most\nof the normativity debates, i.e., by referring to a \u201cprimitive\nought\u201d. This speaks to the primitively normative attitudes\nspeakers must have towards their own uses of linguistic expressions.\nFor starters, having primitively normative attitudes does not require\nprior grasp of rules, concepts, or meanings. Moreover, the norms\nspeakers need to be primitively conscious of do not guide or justify\nthem in their use of expressions (Ginsborg 2011b:\n 170).[39]\n And finally, the primitive \u201cought\u201d relevant to meaning\ncannot be explicated in terms of, or equated with, truth\u2014to be\nprimitively correct is more fundamental than being semantically\ncorrect: Primitive normativity is not required to determine what is\nsemantically correct (and incorrect), but rather to \u201cdistinguish\nthe production of a term from mere noise\u201d (Ginsborg 2012: 132,\nquoting Blackburn 1984: 281), or, more generally, to determine which\nbehaviour is \u201csubject to normative evaluation at all\u201d\n(2011a: 243, fn.\n 21).[40]\n\nPrimitive normativity thus is what distinguishes the behaviour of the\nspeaker who uses her terms with understanding from that of\nthe parrot, or automaton. Using a term with understanding requires\nmore than just being disposed to use it a certain way, Ginsborg\nargues; it requires understanding that it has a certain\nmeaning. If a speaker for instance uses \u201cslab\u201d to\nmean slab, she needs to grasp or recognize that it means\nslab (2012: 135). Ginsborg\u2019s ambition is precisely to\nprovide necessary and sufficient conditions for what it is to have\nthis understanding.\n\nThe account of meaning determination she arrives at has two\ncomponents. Since one of them is a requirement of primitive\nnormativity, primitive normativity qualifies as a (new) kind of\nmeaning determining normativity. In rough outline, the account looks\nlike this:\n\n(G)\nAs used by a speaker \\(S\\), an expression \\(e\\) has a particular\nmeaning \\(M\\) iff\n\n\ni.\n\\(S\\) is disposed to use \\(e\\) in a certain way, and\nii.\n\\(S\\) is disposed to adopt the attitude of\ntaking-to-be-appropriate to the set of uses to which she is disposed\n(cf. 2011a: 244f; 2012: 138).\n \n\n\nIf \\(e\\) has meaning, the first disposition suffices to determine\nwhich meaning it has. But \\(e\\) has meaning only if the second\ndisposition is in place. Moreover, if both conditions are fulfilled,\nhaving the primitively normative attitude of taking the use one is\ndisposed to make of \\(e\\) amounts to understanding that \\(e\\) means\n\\(M\\).\n\nThese conditions are not only necessary, but sufficient for meaning,\nGinsborg argues, because they allow us \u201cto make sense of a given\nresponse being correct or incorrect\u201d (2011a: 245), where\ncorrectness now is semantic correctness. Once these\nconditions are fulfilled, a particular use of \\(e\\) might not only be\nsuch that you \u201cdid not do what you were disposed to do, but also\ndid not do what you were disposed to regard as appropriate\u201d\n(2011a: 245). This, Ginsborg submits, is enough to make such a use of\n\\(e\\) into a mistake. Once these conditions are fulfilled, that is,\nthe uses you are disposed to make of \\(e\\) \u201ccan retrospectively\nbe identified as the extension of [\\(e\\)]\u201d (2012: 138). And\nthen, your primitively normative attitude amounts to understanding\nthat \\(e\\) means what it does.\n\nThough Ginsborg\u2019s proposal is very interesting, and indeed\nrather different from more established interpretations of the\nnormativity of meaning, it has not gone unchallenged. Miller (2019)\nand Sultanescu (2021) both raise worries about Ginsborg\u2019s reply\nto the skeptic. Miller (2019) argues against Ginsborg\u2019s defence\nof reductive dispositionalism against Kripke\u2019s\nWittgenstein\u2019s \u201cfinitude\u201d objection. Sultanescu\n(2021) points out that Ginsborg\u2019s dispositionalism fails because\nit faces an unsolvable dilemma when it comes to the two constraints\nimposed by Kripke\u2019s skeptic, i.e., that\n\n\nthe correctness of a particular use [of \\(e\\)] be constituted\nindependently of the individual\u2019s perspective on it,\n\n\nand that\n\n\nthe individual have a perspective on the use [of \\(e\\)], on pain of\nrendering the use an instance of arbitrary behaviour.\n\n\nSultanescu points out that Ginsborg\u2019s dispositionalism is able\nto meet the second constraint, but not the first. After proposing\namends to Ginsborg\u2019s proposal in order to make room for the\nfirst constraint, Sultanescu points out that now, under this new\ninterpretation, Ginsborg fails to meet the skeptic\u2019s second\nconstraint.\n\nMiller (2019) and Sorgiovanni (2018) also raise concerns about the\nviability of Ginsborg\u2019s \u201cprimitive\u201d rule-following.\nIn particular, Miller (2019) points out that her argument for why\nrules do not guide agents, is based on the (mistaken, and disproven by\nWittgenstein himself) assumption that being guided by a rule\nnecessarily requires interpreting that rule (2019:\n 746).[41]\n What\u2019s more, Miller takes issue with her primitive normativity\nby claiming that the attitude of\n\u201ctaking-to-be-appropriate\u201d cannot really be made sense of\nunless we expect the speaker to already take e \u201cto have a\nmeaning or to be governed by a standard of correctness\u201d.\nFinally, Miller (2019: 755\u2013757) and Verheggen (2015) argue that\nwe have little reason to prefer Ginsborg\u2019s partial reductionism\nover both non-reductionism and reductionism as Ginsborg\u2019s\nproposal seems to face the same challenges raised against those two\nopposing views.\n3. Content\n\nIn the normativity debate the main focus has been on meaning: This is\ntrue of the Kripke discussion as well as of earlier discussions\nconcerning the rulishness of language. However, parallel claims have\nalso been made about mental content and recently the thesis that\ncontent is essentially normative has come into focus (McDowell &\nPettit 1986, Brandom 1994, Engel 2000, Boghossian 2003, Gibbard 2003,\nMillar 2004, Jarvis 2012, Hlobil 2015, Miller 2015, Tracy 2020, Green\n 2021).[42]\n\nContent normativism claims that the following is both necessary, and\nessential to, a mental state \\(M\\)\u2018s having a content \\(p\\):\n\n(C)\n\\(M\\) has content \\(p\\) only if there is a rule, or system of\nrules, \\(R\\) in force for\n \\(M.\\)[43]\n\n\nThe relevant notion of content is that of propositional content,\nsomething that can be judged, and the norms in question govern the\n\u201cuse\u201d of concepts. We intend the talk of propositions and\nconcepts in this context to be uncontentious, and not depend on any\nspecific construals of these notions. A proposition, simply, is\nanything that has truth conditions essentially; it is whatever the\npropositional attitudes are attitudes towards. And talking of\n\u201cconcepts\u201d should not be understood as implying a\ncommitment to either structured contents or to a language-like,\nsyntactically structured medium of representation. In this sense, a\nconcept is \u201cused\u201d whenever a subject has an intentional\nmental\n state.[44]\n\nAs in the case of meaning, we distinguish between CE normativity,\nwhich is neutral on the question how content is determined, and CD\nnormativity which takes the norms to be metaphysically primary. We\nshall begin by discussing CE normativity.\n3.1 Content Engendered Normativity\n\nAccording to CE normativity statements of the form \u201cmental state\n\\(M\\) has content \\(p\\)\u201d have normative consequences. The norms\nare typically construed as norms of action, most commonly as\nprescriptions, but could also be construed axiologically. That is, the\nclaim need not be that the relevant norms guide our use of concepts,\nbut could just be that it is a property essential to their having\ncontent that certain mental states (true beliefs, for instance) are\nvaluable.\n\nAs in the case of meaning, we may distinguish between more or less\ndirect arguments. One way to provide a direct argument for CE\nnormativity would be to proceed from the notion of correctness\nconditions, in analogy with the simple argument (Boghossian 2003: 85).\nJust as meaningful expressions have correctness conditions\nessentially, along the lines of\n (CM),\n so do concepts: The concept green, for instance, applies to\nan object \\(x\\) if and only if \\(x\\) is green. However, unlike in the\ncase of (CM), the application relation here is just that between a\nconcept and the objects that \u201cfall under\u201d it. For\nnormativity to enter some connection has to be made with the subject\nwho employs the concepts, with her mental states.\n\nThe standard normativist strategy consists in appealing to the use of\nconcepts in propositional attitudes, and to derive the normativity of\ncontent from that of the propositional attitudes. We shall consider\ntwo such common arguments: one that goes via the nature of belief, and\none that goes via ideas about concept grasp.\n3.1.1 The Argument from Belief\n\nThe argument from belief proceeds in two steps: It is argued, first,\nthat belief is essentially normative, and second, that there is an\nessential connection between belief and content such that if belief is\nessentially normative it follows that content is, too. Our main\nconcern here is not with the normativity of belief, but some comments\nconcerning the first step are required.\n\nAccording to the most common proposal, the normativity of belief\nderives from the connection between belief and truth. The proposal is\nnot merely that beliefs, essentially, have contents that are true or\nfalse, but that beliefs, by their very nature, generate a normative\nrequirement that establishes that they are correct or incorrect as a\nresult of their content being true or false. Such a requirement is\ndistinctive of belief and provides a \u201cdecisive reason\u201d for\nhaving or not having a particular belief (Wedgwood, 2002: 268. See\nalso Velleman 2000; Engel 2001, 2013; Noordhof 2021; Wedgwood 2007,\n2013; Boghossian 2003; Gibbard 2003, 2005, 2012; Shah 2003; Speaks\n2009; Nolfi 2015; Fassio 2016).\n\nIn response, it has been argued that what is essential to belief is\nmerely that beliefs have contents that are true or false, not that one\nought to believe a content if and only if it is true. The appearance\nof normativity, it is suggested, derives from other sources. For\ninstance, as epistemic agents, we seek truth. And having true beliefs\nis essential to fulfilling our goals. This just shows that true\nbeliefs have an instrumental value, and fails to support the\nnormativity of belief thesis. Moreover, it is argued, even if it is\nclaimed that truth has a non-instrumental value, the value in question\nis derived from moral or other values, not from the nature of belief\nas such (Papineau & Tanney 1999, 2013; Dretske 2000; Davidson\n2001a; Horwich 2013; Bergamaschi Ganapini 2021).\n\nQuestions have also been raised concerning how the norm of belief is\nto be understood. With respect to meaning the question arose whether\n \\((\\ME_1)\\)\n violates the principle that ought implies can. In\nthe case of belief, a similar worry arises if the norm of belief is\nformulated in a parallel fashion, by proceeding from the correctness\nconditions of beliefs to normative consequences:\n\n(CB)\nThe belief that \\(p\\) is correct if and only if \\(p\\).\n\\((\\NB_1)\\)\n\\( S\\) ought to believe that \\(p\\) if and only if \\(p\\).\n\n\nThe trouble is that\n \\((\\NB_1)\\)\n implies that \\(S\\) ought to believe everything that is true, an\nimpossible task. This difficulty, it has been argued, is not solved by\nappealing to a wide-scope reading of \u201cought\u201d since there\nare values of \\(p\\) that are such that \\(S\\) could neither bring it\nabout that \\(p\\) is false, nor bring it about that she believes \\(p\\)\n(Bykvist & Hattiangadi 2007:\n 284).[45]\n The most common reaction, instead, is to weaken the norm (Boghossian\n2003: 37):\n\n\\((\\NB_2)\\)\n\\( S\\) ought to believe that \\(p\\) only if \\(p\\).\n\n\nThis norm does not imply that \\(S\\) ought to believe everything that\nis true, and hence does not put impossible demands on \\(S\\). However,\nas noted in the discussion of\n \\((\\ME_1)\\)\n above, the question arises whether \\((\\NB_2)\\) suffices to provide\nany real constraints on \\(S\\)\u2018s belief formation. If \\(p\\) is\ntrue it does not follow that \\(S\\) ought to believe \\(p\\), and if\n\\(p\\) is false it merely follows that it is not the case that \\(S\\)\nought to believe \\(p\\)\u2014not that \\(S\\) ought not to believe \\(p\\)\n(Bykvist & Hattiangadi 2007:\n 280).[46]\n In response, normativists have made the same move as in the case of\nmeaning, and suggested that the \u201cought\u201d in\n \\((\\NB_1)\\)\n is replaced with a \u201cmay\u201d (Whiting 2010: 216\u2013217;\n2013: 125). It has been objected that this is too weak since it\nundermines the fundamental role of the norm of truth when it comes to\nexplaining other evidential and inferential norms (Bykvist &\nHattiangadi 2013: 113\u2013114) and to accounting for some key\nfeature of doxastic deliberation (Sullivan-Bissett & Noordhof\n 2020).[47]\n\nAdopting a different tack the normativist could say that the relevant\nnorms should be understood in terms of the \u201ctelos\u201d of\nbelief: Just as a map is a map (giving a correct or incorrect picture\nof the world) only insofar as it is designed to represent the world,\nand in this sense ought to represent the world correctly, so a belief\ncan be said to be correct or incorrect only insofar as representing\nthe world belongs to its telos, to what it ought to do. Since this\ntype of \u201cought\u201d applies to the representing objects (such\nas maps or beliefs) and not to agents, it is argued, they are not\naction-guiding and the principle that ought implies\ncan does not apply (Jarvis\n 2012).[48]\n\nAnother set of questions concerns the fact that\n \\((\\NB_1)\\)\n is an objective\n norm.[49]\n Unlike a subjective norm, such as \u201c\\(S\\) ought to believe that\n\\(p\\) only if \\(S\\) has evidence for \\(p\\)\u201d, \\((\\NB_1)\\) does\nnot engage with \\(S\\)\u2018s reasons, her beliefs and desires, and\nthis raises the question of how \\((\\NB_1)\\) can serve to guide our\nbelief formation. Objective norms can guide only via our beliefs, and\nit has been argued that this raises two worries for \\((\\NB_1\\)). In\norder to be guided by \\((\\NB_1\\)), \\(S\\) would have to have a belief\nabout whether \\(p\\) is true. This means, first, that in order to be\nguided by \\((\\NB_1\\)) the subject would already have had to form a\nbelief as to whether \\(p\\) and hence the guidance comes too late; and,\nsecond, that whatever conclusion the subject comes to as to whether\n\\(p\\), the norm tells her to hold that very belief (if she forms the\nbelief that \\(p\\) the norm gives her a reason to believe \\(p\\) and if\nshe forms the belief that not-\\(p\\) the norm gives her a reason to\nbelieve not-\\(p\\)) (Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss 2009:\n 44).[50]\n It is therefore disputed whether \\((\\NB_1)\\) can be said to be a norm\nof belief, regulating our belief\n formation.[51]\n\nAnother key challenge to the idea that belief is essentially normative\nis that belief seems to be subject to multiple normative standards. In\naddition to the idea that one should only believe what is true or\nfollow the evidence, there are now also several arguments for the\nclaim that at times pragmatic and moral norms govern belief as well\nand these may be normatively heavier than any epistemic norm at play\n(Maru\u0161i\u0107 2011; Reisner 2018; Basu 201; Leary 2017; Rinard\n2019) . If so, then there are no essential or constitutive normative\nrequirements for belief: though there might be distinctive correctness\nconditions for belief (as in CB) these do not appear to be genuinely\nnormative or do not seem to explain what \u201cone just plain\nought\u201d to believe such and such (Maguire & Woods 2020;\nBergamaschi Ganapini 2021).\n\nFinally, assuming that belief is intrinsically normative,\nhowever, the decisive question is whether this has any implications\nfor content. Why should the fact that belief is normative imply that\ncontent is? Indeed, it has been suggested that the opposite is true\nsince if belief is normative the appearance of normativity of content\ncan simply be explained by appealing to the normativity of belief\n(Speaks 2009: 409). According to Boghossian, the normativity of\ncontent derives from the fact that there is a constitutive connection\nbetween the notion of content and the notion of belief (Boghossian\n2003). This is so, he argues, since we could not grasp the notion of\ncontent without first grasping the role contents play in belief.\nMoreover, Boghossian argues, although contents play a role in other\nattitudes as well, there are reasons to think that the concept of\nbelief is conceptually primary: For instance, \\(S\\) could not have the\nconcept of desire without first having the concept of belief (2003:\n42\u201343). If so, the normativity of belief supports CE\nnormativity.\n\nThe claim that the concept of belief is primary to that of desire can\nbe questioned. Thus, there is empirical evidence from developmental\npsychology that children acquire the concept of desire prior to\nacquiring that of belief (Wellman 1993). It has also been argued that\nbelief and desire are conceptually interdependent (Miller 2008). More\nimportantly, even if it can be shown that the concept of belief is\nprimary to that of desire, and of the other propositional attitudes,\nthe question arises whether indeed one could not grasp the concept of\ncontent without grasping that of belief. Prima facie,\ngrasping the concept of a propositional attitude such as belief is\nrather distinct from grasping the concept of content, since it\ninvolves the idea of taking up an attitude towards\n content.[52]\n Moreover, Boghossian is committed to the strong claim that opponents\nof content normativity fail to grasp the concept of content (or,\nalternatively, that they operate with a different concept).\n\nAn alternative strategy would be to avoid the appeal to conceptual\nentailments and argue that there is a metaphysical connection between\nmental content and belief such that if belief is essentially\nnormative, content is. Such an argument may be more or less direct,\ngoing via more or less contentious assumptions about mental\n content.[53]\n\nFor instance, versions of conceptual role semantics imply that there\nis an essential link between mental content and belief as do versions\nof informational theories of content (Dretske 1981; Fodor 1990),\nalthough the latter are typically coupled with a non-normativist\naccount of belief. Another line of reasoning appeals to the idea that\nthere is a constitutive connection between grasping a concept,\nunderstanding a content, and using it in the propositional\nattitudes.\n3.1.2 Use in Keeping with Content\n\nTo possess a concept, it is sometimes suggested, is to have the\ncapacity to use the concept in various propositional attitudes. Since\nit is essential to the propositional attitudes that they stand in\ncertain rational interconnections with one another, it is argued, this\nessential normativity transfers to concepts and contents. Possessing a\nconcept, grasping it, incurs a commitment to use the concept \u201cin\nkeeping with its content\u201d, in the various propositional\nattitudes. If the speaker fails to do so, she has misused the\nconcept in question (Millar 2004; McDowell & Pettit 1986; Gibbard\n2012: chapter 6).\n\nThis argument runs parallel to the argument from understanding in\nsupport of ME normativity\n (section 2.1.2).\n Even if that argument is accepted, however, the question arises\nwhether it can be applied to concepts and content, since the notion of\nfailing to use a concept in \u201ckeeping with its content\u201d\nappears more problematic than the notion of failing to use a word in\naccordance with its meaning (McGinn 1984: 146\u2013147; Millar 2004:\n180\u2013181). It is relatively unproblematic to speak of\nunderstanding the meaning of an expression (or misunderstanding it),\nbut in the case of concepts there is nothing corresponding to the\nexpression. To \u201cunderstand\u201d a concept is simply to possess\nit, to use it in thoughts. Hence there seems to be little or no room\nfor the idea that \\(S\\) misunderstands a concept either. If \\(S\\)\nreasons as if she possesses the concept ancient rather than\nthe concept arcane, it would seem to follow not that there is\nany misuse of concepts but that she has another concept.\n\nOne strategy is to distinguish between possession conditions and\nattribution conditions (Peacocke 1992: 27\u201333). This separates\nthe conditions that determine \\(S\\)\u2019s concepts from conditions\nfor the attribution of the concept to \\(S\\). As a consequence, there\nis a potential gap between how \\(S\\) uses the concept, her grasp of\nit, and how it should be used if she were to use it in keeping with\nits content. To illustrate the distinction, it is common to appeal to\nTyler Burge\u2019s discussion of how social factors, under certain\nconditions, serve to determine content (Burge 1979; Peacocke 1992: 29;\nMillar 2004: 181\u2013188). Burge gives an account of concept\nattribution that goes via word meaning. To be attributed the concept\narcane, on this view, it suffices that \\(S\\) uses the\nexpression \u201carcane\u201d by and large correctly, \u201cin\nkeeping with its content\u201d\u2014if she is committed to her\ncommunity practice of using the corresponding expression\n\u201carcane\u201d. What determines her concept, thus, is not merely\nfacts about her use and dispositions to stand corrected, but facts\nabout the use of the term in the wider practice. It follows that\nspeakers typically have an incomplete grasp of the concepts they think\nwith and, as a result, tend to misuse these concepts.\n\nLeaving aside the controversial question of whether we can separate\npossession conditions of concepts from attribution conditions, it\nmight be asked whether Burge\u2019s social externalism can be\nemployed to support CE normativity. Burge\u2019s argument depends on\nthe (empirical) assumption that the individual is committed to the\ncommunity practice (Burge 1979: 94\u201395, 101\u2013102; Millar\n2004: 182). But if the normativity in question is made conditional on\nthe individual\u2019s commitment to the community, it does not follow\nthat content is essentially normative. After all, an individual who is\nnot thus committed would still have concepts. (Equally, in the case of\nthe experts, the suggested normative dimension would seem to drop\nout.) What would be required, rather, is an argument to the effect\nthat the concept expressed is necessarily determined by the community\npractice, independently of \\(S\\)\u2018s commitments.\n\nArguments from concept grasp, again, typically appeal to the idea that\nthere are rationality constraints on concept attributions. As noted in\nthe discussion of ME normativity, the question has been raised whether\nthe idea that there are such constraints coheres with normativism. It\nhas been suggested that this question is particularly pressing in the\ncase of content. When it comes to meaning, there is the option of\nattributing meaning errors and explaining the error by appealing to\nthe subject\u2019s mistaken conception of the meaning of an\nexpression, thereby rationalizing her reasoning and actions. In the\ncase of concepts, this option is not available, since the error is\nsaid to occur at the level of content. It would either have to be\nargued that the error can be rationalized some other way, or the claim\nthat there are rationality constraints on content attributions would\nhave to be rejected (see Brown 2004, Wikforss 2015 and 2017).\n3.2 Content Determining Normativity\n\nLike MD normativism, CD normativism is a foundational claim:\nIntentional content is (at least partially) metaphysically determined\nby rules or norms, content facts are, if you will, (at least\npartially) \u201cgrounded\u201d by normative facts. Since the\nrelevant norms or rules govern intentional mental states, the CD\nnormativist typically tries to find a particular kind of state\nplausibly subject to rules or norms that by the same token (at least\npartially) determine contents for states of this kind. As truth and\ninference are intimately connected with both content and belief, the\ndebate focuses on norms for belief.\n\nBesides truth norms like\n (\\(\\NB_1)\\)\n and \\((\\NB_2)\\) above, two further kinds of candidate norms of belief\nhave been discussed: knowledge norms, and norms of\nrationality, justification, or\n inference.[54]\n CD normativism then is the claim that beliefs cannot have content\nunless rules or norms of at least one of these kinds are in force for\nthem. Strong versions of CD normativism hold that CD norms also\ndetermine which contents beliefs have. And again, being in force can\nroughly be interpreted in three ways: As requiring the subject to\nfollow the relevant rule or norm \\(R\\), to accept\n\\(R\\) in a sense not requiring (general) following, or as\nindependent of the subject\u2019s attitudes and intentional states\ntowards \\(R\\) (see above,\n section 2.2.1).\n\nAs in the case of meaning, CD normativism most often is a form of\nguidance normativism construing belief formation as an\nessentially rule-guided activity. Those inspired by pragmatism and/or\nWittgensteinian anti-platonism might also think of the relevant rules\nas \u201cof our own making\u201d (Baker & Hacker 1985; Brandom\n1994). A fairly common idea is that believers follow basic, objective\nnorms such as truth or knowledge norms by means of being\nguided by subjective ones such as the rules of rationality (Boghossian\n2003), but others take subjective rules as\n basic,[55]\n or argue that the nature of belief is given by subjective and\nobjective norms in combination (Wedgwood 2007: 162).\n\nUnsurprisingly, norms or rules for (rational) reasoning\nreceive a lot of attention. Prime examples are inference rules such as\nmodus ponens or the law of non-contradiction. Purely formal\nrules would arguably be too weak for the purposes of strong CD\nnormativism; normative inferentialists such as Brandom (1994; 2000) or\nPeregrin (2008) therefore include norms governing material implication\namong the content determining rules. In general, principles governing\nepistemic rationality (as, for instance, formalized in Bayesian\nepistemology) are further examples, and for those who hold that there\ncan be good practical reasons for belief, principles of practical\nreasoning are also\n relevant.[56]\n\nAs we have already seen in\n section 2.2\n above, regress worries arise if CD normativism takes the form of\nguidance normativism. Here, a pragmatic conception of rule guidance\nsuch as Brandom\u2019s normative version of inferentialism (Brandom\n1994) might help. To avoid regresses, Brandom takes norms implicitly\n\u201cinstituted\u201d by our practices to be basic and proposes a\npragmatic phenomenalism about such norms. Objective\n\u201cdeontic statuses\u201d are to be explained in terms of our\nnormative attitudes. Something\u2019s being correct, that\nis, is to be explained in terms of the attitude of taking it to be\ncorrect, making the norms in question \u201cin some sense\ncreatures of ours\u201d (1994: 626); yet, the goal is to secure and\nexplain the \u201cobjectivity of concepts\u201d (1994:\n xvii).[57]\n As attitudes of taking something to be correct can themselves be\ncorrect or incorrect, being correct ultimately has to be\nexplained in terms of being correctly taken to be correct. In\nthis sense, the normativity is irreducible\u2014it is \u201cnorms\nall the way down\u201d (1994: 44; 625).\n\nQuestions that have been raised for pragmatic phenomenalism include\nwhether it in fact can account for contents the truth of which is\nindependent of our attitudes. Because it explains normative statuses\nby means of further normative statuses, pragmatic phenomenalism might\nnot be able to tell us anything informative about how we make or\n\u201cinstitute\u201d the basic norms implicit in our practices (cf.\nRosen 2001, Hattiangadi 2003) or to account for the difference between\ninstituting and merely being in accordance with a norm. Yet another\nregress worry has also been raised: if for any normative status to be\ninstituted by an implicit norm a further normative status already\nneeds to be so instituted, an infinite regress of (implicit) norms\nmight ensue despite the pragmatist nature of the proposal (cf.\nHattiangadi 2007: 197; Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss 2009: 60ff). This\nregress might not be vicious if the project is interpreted as an\nexpressivist one, however.\n\nEven if guidance normativism would inescapably lead to some form of\nregress, one might still hold on to the claim that there are\ncontentful intentional states only if for instance the rules of\nrationality are in force for them. As we noted already in the previous\nversion of this entry, such force might require acceptance, but not\n(general) guidance, or it might be completely independent of the\nattitudes of thinkers. Highlighting both these options, it has\nrecently been argued that guidance normativism is unnecessarily\ndemanding.\n\nFor one thing, even if the relevant rules require some sort of\nacceptance to be in force, not every performance governed by them\nneeds to actually be guided by them (cf. Hlobil 2015; Tracy 2020).\nPlausible as this might initially seem, especially when thinking along\nthe lines of the game analogy, a general observation of this kind does\nnot yet substantiate the claim that an account of constitutive\nrules\u2019 being in force that implements this possibility would be\napplicable to CD rules or\n norms.[58]\n Moreover, it should be noted that for CD rules or norms, making this\nmove might not just amount to acknowledging that not every instance of\nbelief formation has to be rule-guided. If the move is to stop an\nintentional condition on rule-following from giving rise to a regress,\nwe might end up having to say that every instance of rule-guided\nbelief formation requires the unguided formation of at least\none other belief or intentional state. For every rule that is followed\n(on a particular occasion), that is, there is another that governs,\nbut cannot guide, the formation of a further intentional\nstate of the rule-follower (on that\n occasion).[59]\n This is at least a surprising situation to end up in for a defender\nof the view that belief is essentially governed by rules that can\nguide belief\n formation.[60]\n CD normativism might thus prove viable only if the force of the\nrelevant rules or norms can plausibly be construed in complete\nindependence of the attitudes of the thinkers.\n4. Concluding Remarks: Normativism and Naturalism\n\nThe idea that the normative in some sense is not part of nature goes\nback at least to Kant (see, for instance, Critique of Pure\nReason [1781 [A 547]]). Already Hume (in the Treatise\n[1739\u20131740]) argued against the metaethical naturalist that\nought cannot be derived from is\u2014to try to do\nso would be to commit a so-called \u201cnaturalistic fallacy\u201d.\nWith the \u201copen question argument\u201d, Moore (in Principia\nEthica [1903]) added a weapon to the anti-naturalist\u2019s\narsenal also against giving naturalistic accounts of moral\nevaluations: According to the open question argument, there is no\nnaturalistic (set of) concept(s) analytically equivalent to the moral\nconcept of goodness, since no matter what naturalistic definition is\ngiven, the question whether all and only things satisfying it are good\nstill makes sense. Much of recent normativism about meaning/content\ncontinues in this anti-naturalist tradition; many normativists about\nmeaning/content hold that the essential normativity of meaning/content\nmakes at least (fully) reductive naturalism untenable.\n\nMany have construed Kripke\u2019s Wittgenstein as saying exactly\nthat: it is part of his skeptical campaign against semantic facts in\ngeneral that such facts cannot be reduced to whatever precisely is\nallowed in a naturalistic supervenience base for meaning/content. An\nargument for this could take a weaker, intensionalist, and a stronger,\nextensionalist, form (cf. Boghossian 1989a: 532ff). The stronger\nargument concludes that no reductive naturalist account of\nmeaning/content will be extensionally correct: For any\nmeaning/concept, such an account will either include objects in its\nextension that, intuitively, do not belong there, or exclude objects\nfrom its extension that, intuitively, do belong there, or both. As we\nsaw above\n (section 2.2.1),\n this \u201cproblem of error\u201d is a problem for many\nnaturalistic accounts of meaning/content, but as such it does not yet\nhave anything to do with normativity. To that, the normativist could\nrespond that it is precisely because of their essential normativity\nthat no naturalistic account of meaning/content can be extensionally\ncorrect. The weaker argument grants extensional correctness, but\nargues that no naturalistic reduction will get the intension of the\nnotion of meaning/content right; it will inevitably miss the normative\ncharacter of what is semantically correct, its deontic or axiologic\ncharacteristics.\n\nDespite the normativists\u2019 argument, it seems fair to say that at\nthis point in time, the case from normativism against reductive\nnaturalism about meaning/content has not yet been fully made. To make\ntheir case, the semantic normativist could resort to adopting a\nmetaethical approach: arguments in the tradition of Hume and Moore\nmight well be adaptable to their case (cf. Miller 1998, 188ff;\nHattiangadi 2007, 38ff; Gibbard 2012; Zalabardo 2012). As Hattiangadi\nargues, though, the semantic normativist\u2019s case ends up being\nhostage to whatever controversial assumptions these arguments rely on\n(motivational internalism, for instance, might be such an issue), thus\nremoving normativism further from being the pre-theoretical constraint\non acceptable accounts of meaning/content that Kripke\u2019s skeptic\nmeant it to be. What\u2019s more, one might worry that the topic of\n\u201creduction\u201d is itself more nuanced than the normativist\nmakes it to be. As we have seen in\n section 2.2,\n it is still possible to argue that some (set of) dispositions might\nplay a role in meaning-determination. Alternatively, it is possible to\nendorse partially reductive accounts construing meaning/content as\ndetermined by a dispositional and a non-semantic, but normative,\ncomponent.\n\nFurthermore, even if normativism about meaning/content might exclude\n(fully) reductive naturalism about meaning/content, it should be noted\nthat adopting normativism would not seem to be the only option for the\nanti-reductivist (cf. Mulligan 1999: 136f; Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss\n2009: 63ff). What the normativist construes as norms or rules of\nmeaning/content, principles such as\n (CM)\n or inferential rules such as modus ponens, might also be construed in\na very different way: As, or in analogy with what Frege called\n\u201claws of truth\u201d (Frege 1918 [1986: 30]). In the same vein,\nHusserl called the \u201claws of logic\u201d \u201cideal\u201d\n(Husserl 1913: 56)). These \u201claws\u201d are neither\nprescriptions for thinking, nor nomological generalities of our\npsychology. Their \u201cvalidity\u201d or necessity is sui\ngeneris; if anything, it is what we might today call\n metaphysical.[61]",
