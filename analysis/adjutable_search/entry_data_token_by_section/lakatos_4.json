    "main_text": "Lakatos\u2019s Big Ideas || Improving on Popper in the Philosophy of Science\n2.2 Improving on Popper in the Philosophy of Science\n\nThe dissidence continues with Lakatos\u2019s second major\ncontribution to philosophy, his \u201cMethodology of Scientific\nResearch Programmes\u201d or MSRP (developed in detail in in his\nFMSRP), a radical revision of Popper\u2019s Demarcation Criterion\nbetween science and non-science, leading to a novel theory of\nscientific rationality. This is arguably a lot more realistic than the\nPopperian theory it was designed to supplant (or, in earlier\nformulations, the Popperian theory that it was designed to amend). For\nPopper, a theory is only scientific if is empirically\nfalsifiable, that is if it is possible to specify observation\nstatements which would prove it wrong. A theory is good\nscience, the sort of theory you should stick with (though not the sort\nof thing you should believe since Popper did not believe in belief),\nif it is refutable, risky, and problem-solving and has stood up to\nsuccessive attempts at refutation. It must be highly falsifiable,\nwell-tested but (thus far) unfalsified.\n\nLakatos objects that although there is something to be said for\nPopper\u2019s criterion, it is far too restrictive, since it would\nrule out too much of everyday scientific practice (not to mention the\nvalue-judgments of the scientific elite) as unscientific and\nirrational. For scientists often persist\u2014and, it seems,\nrationally persist\u2014with theories, such as Newtonian\ncelestial mechanics that by Popper\u2019s standards they ought to\nhave rejected as \u201crefuted\u201d, that is theories that (in\nconjunction with other assumptions) have led to falsified predictions.\nA key example for Lakatos is the \u201cPrecession of Mercury\u201d\nthat is, the anomalous behaviour of the perihelion of Mercury, which\nshifts around the Sun in a way that it ought not to do if\nNewton\u2019s mechanics were correct and there were no other sizable\nbody influencing its orbit. The problem is that there seems to be no\nsuch body. The difficulty was well known for decades but it did not\ncause astronomers to collectively give up on Newton until\nEinstein\u2019s theory came along. Lakatos thought that the\nastronomers were right not to abandon Newton even though Newton\neventually turned out to be wrong and Einstein turned out to be\nright.\n\nAgain, Copernican heliocentric astronomy was born\n\u201crefuted\u201d because of the apparent non-existence of stellar\nparallax. If the earth goes round the sun then the apparent position\nof at least some of the fixed stars (namely the closest ones)\nought to vary with respect to the more distant ones as the earth is\nmoving with respect to them. Some parts of the night sky should look a\nlittle different at perihelion (when the earth is furthest from the\nsun) from the way that they look at aphelion (when the earth is at its\nnearest to the sun, and hence at the other end of its orbit). But for\nnearly three centuries after the publication of Copernicus\u2019\nDe Revolutionibus 1543, no such differences were observed. In\nfact, there is a very slight difference in the apparent positions of\nthe nearest stars depending on the earth\u2019s position in its\norbit, but the difference is so very slight as to be almost\nundetectable. Indeed it was completely undetectable until\n1838 when sufficiently powerful telescopes and measuring techniques\nwere able to detect it, by which time the heliocentric view had long\nbeen regarded as an established fact. Thus astronomers had not given\nup on either Copernicus or his successors despite this apparent\nfalsification.\n\nBut if scientists often persist with \u201crefuted\u201d theories,\neither the scientists are being unscientific or Popper is wrong about\nwhat constitutes good science, and hence about what scientists ought\nto do. Lakatos\u2019s idea is to construct a methodology of science,\nand with it a demarcation criterion, whose precepts are more in\naccordance with scientific practice.\n\nHow does it work? Well, falsifiability continues to play a part in\nLakatos\u2019s conception of science but its importance is somewhat\ndiminished. Instead of an individual falsifiable theory which\nought to be rejected as soon as it is refuted, we have a\nsequence of falsifiable theories characterized by shared a\nhard core of central theses that are deemed\nirrefutable\u2014or, at least, refutation-resistant\u2014by\nmethodological fiat. This sequence of theories constitutes a\nresearch programme.\n\nThe shared hard core of this sequence of theories is often\nunfalsifiable in two senses of the term.\n\nFirstly scientists working within the programme are typically (and\nrightly) reluctant to give up on the claims that constitute the hard\ncore.\n\nSecondly the hard core theses by themselves are often devoid\nof empirical consequences. For example, Newtonian mechanics by\nitself\u2014the three laws of mechanics and the law of\ngravitation\u2014won\u2019t tell you what you will see in the night\nsky. To derive empirical predictions from Newtonian mechanics you need\na whole host of auxiliary hypotheses about the positions,\nmasses and relative velocities of the heavenly bodies, including the\nearth. (This is related to Duhem\u2019s thesis that, generally\nspeaking, theoretical propositions\u2014and indeed sets of\ntheoretical propositions\u2014cannot be conclusively falsified by\nexperimental observations, since they only entail\nobservation-statements in conjunction with auxiliary hypotheses. So\nwhen something goes wrong, and the observation statements that they\nentail turn out to be false, we have two intellectual\noptions: modify the theoretical propositions or modify the auxiliary\nhypotheses. See Ariew 2014.) For Lakatos an individual theory within a\nresearch programme typically consists of two components: the (more or\nless) irrefutable hard core plus a set of auxiliary hypotheses.\nTogether with the hard core these auxiliary hypotheses entail\nempirical predictions, thus making the theory as a whole\u2014hard\ncore plus auxiliary hypotheses\u2014a falsifiable affair.\n\nWhat happens when refutation strikes, that is when the hard core in\nconjunction with the auxiliary hypotheses entails empirical\npredictions which turn out to be false? What we have essentially is a\nmodus tollens argument in which science supplies one of the\npremises and nature (plus experiment and observation) supplies the\nother:\n\n\nIf <hard core plus auxiliary hypotheses>, then O\n(where O represents some observation statement);\nNot-O (Nature shouts \u201cno\u201d: the predictions\ndon\u2019t pan out);\n\n\nTherefore\n\nNot <hard core plus auxiliary hypotheses>.\n\n\n\nBut logic leaves us with a choice. The conjunction of the\nhard core plus the auxiliary hypotheses has to go, but we can retain\neither the hard core or the auxiliary hypotheses. What Lakatos calls\nthe negative heuristic of the research programme, bids us\nretain the hard core but modify the auxiliary hypotheses:\n\n\nThe negative heuristic of the programme forbids us to direct the\nmodus tollens at this \u201chard core\u201d. Instead, we\nmust use our ingenuity to articulate or even invent \u201cauxiliary\nhypotheses\u201d, which form a protective belt around this core, and\nwe must redirect the modus tollens to these. It is this\nprotective belt of auxiliary hypotheses which has to bear the\nbrunt of tests and gets adjusted and re-adjusted, or even completely\nreplaced, to defend the thus-hardened core. (FMSRP: 48)\n\n\nThus when refutation strikes, the scientist constructs a new\ntheory, the next in the sequence, with the same hard core but a\nmodified set of auxiliary hypotheses. How is she supposed to do this?\nWell, associated with the hard core, there is what Lakatos calls the\npositive heuristic of the programme.\n\n\nThe positive heuristic consists of a partially articulated set of\nsuggestions or hints on how to change, develop the \u201crefutable\nvariants\u201d of the research programme, how to modify,\nsophisticate, the \u201crefutable\u201d protective belt. (FMSRP:\n50)\n\n\nFor example, if a planet is not moving in quite the smooth ellipse\nthat it ought to follow a) if Newtonian mechanics were correct and b)\nif there were nothing but the sun and the planet itself to worry\nabout, then the positive heuristic of the Newtonian programme bids us\nlook for another heavenly body whose gravitational force\nmight be distorting the first planet\u2019s orbit. Alternatively, if\nstellar parallax is not observed, we can try to refute this apparent\nrefutation by refining our instruments and making more careful\nmeasurements and observations.\n\nLakatos evidently thinks that when one theory in the sequence has been\nrefuted, scientists can legitimately persist with the hard core\nwithout being in too much of a hurry to construct the next refutable\ntheory in the sequence. The fact that some planetary orbits are not\nquite what they ought to be should not lead us to abandon Newtonian\ncelestial mechanics, even if we don\u2019t yet have a testable theory\nabout what exactly is distorting them. It is worth remarking too that\nthe auxiliary hypotheses play a rather paradoxical part in\nLakatos\u2019s methodology. On the one hand, they connect\nthe central theses of the hard core with experience, allowing to them\nto figure in testable, and hence, refutable theories. On the other\nhand, they insulate the theses of the hard core from\nrefutation, since when the arrow of modus tollens strikes, we\ndirect it at the auxiliary hypotheses rather than the hard core.\n\nSo far we have had an account of what scientists typically do\ndo and what Lakatos thinks that they ought to do. But what\nabout the Demarcation Criterion between science and non-science or\nbetween good science and bad? Even if it is sometimes\nrational to persist with the hard core of a theory when the hard core\nplus some set of auxiliary hypotheses has been refuted, there must\nsurely be some circumstances in which is it rational to give\nit up! The Methodology of Scientific Research Programme has got to be\nsomething more than a defence of scientific pig-headedness! As Lakatos\nhimself puts the point:\n\n\nNow, Newton\u2019s theory of gravitation, Einstein\u2019s relativity\ntheory, quantum mechanics, Marxism, Freudianism [the last two stock\nexamples of bad science or pseudo-science for Popperians], are all\nresearch programmes, each with a characteristic hard core stubbornly\ndefended, each with its more flexible protective belt and each with\nits elaborate problem-solving machinery. Each of them, at any stage of\nits development, has unsolved problems and undigested anomalies. All\ntheories, in this sense, are born refuted and die refuted. But are\nthey [all] equally good? (S&P: 4\u20135.)\n\n\nLakatos, of course, thinks not. Some science is objectively better\nthan other science and some science is so unscientific as to hardly\nqualify as science at all. So how does he distinguish between \u201ca\nscientific or progressive programme\u201d and a\n\u201cpseudoscientific or degenerating one\u201d? (S&P:\n4\u20135.)\n\nTo begin with, the unit of scientific evaluation is no longer the\nindividual theory (as with Popper), but the sequence of\ntheories, the research programme. We don\u2019t ask\nourselves whether this or that theory is scientific or not, or whether\nit constitutes good or bad science. Rather we ask ourselves whether\nthe sequence of theories, the research programme, is\nscientific or non-scientific or constitutes good or bad science.\nLakatos\u2019s basic idea is that a research programme constitutes\ngood science\u2014the sort of science it is rational to\nstick with and rational to work on\u2014if it is\nprogressive, and bad science\u2014the kind of\nscience that is, at least, intellectually suspect\u2014if it\nis degenerating. What is it for a research programme to be\nprogressive? It must meet two conditions. Firstly it must be\ntheoretically progressive. That is, each new theory in the\nsequence must have excess empirical content over its predecessor; it\nmust predict novel and hitherto unexpected facts (FMSRP: 33). Secondly\nit must be empirically progressive. Some of that novel\ncontent has to be corroborated, that is, some of the new\n\u201cfacts\u201d that the theory predicts must turn out to be true.\nAs Lakatos himself put the point, a research programme \u201cis\nprogressive if it is both theoretically and empirically\nprogressive, and degenerating if it is not\u201d (FMSRP:\n34). Thus a research programme is degenerating if the successive\ntheories do not deliver novel predictions or if the novel predictions\nthat they deliver turn out to be false.\n\nNovelty is, in part, a comparative notion. The novelty of a research\nprogramme\u2019s predictions is defined with respect to its rivals. A\nprediction is novel if the theory not only predicts something\nnot predicted by the previous theories in the sequence, but\nif the predicted observation is predicted neither by any\nrival programme that might be in the offing nor by the\nconventional wisdom. A programme gets no brownie points by predicting\nwhat everyone knows to be the case but only by predicting observations\nwhich come as some sort of a surprise. (There is some ambiguity here\nand some softening later on\u2014see below\n \u00a73.6\u2014but\n to begin with, at least, this was Lakatos\u2019s dominant idea.)\n\nOne of Lakatos\u2019s key examples is the predicted return of\nHalley\u2019s comet which was derived by observing part of its\ntrajectory and using Newtonian mechanics to calculate the elongated\nellipse in which it was moving. The comet duly turned up seventy-two\nyears later, exactly where and when Halley had predicted, a novel fact\nthat could not have been arrived at without the aid of Newton\u2019s\ntheory (S&P: 5). Before Newton, astronomers might have noticed a\ncomet arriving every seventy-two years (though they would have been\nhard put to it to distinguish that particular comet from any others),\nbut they could not have been as exact about the time and place of its\nreappearance as Halley managed to be. Newton\u2019s theory delivered\nfar more precise predictions than the rival heliocentric theory\ndeveloped by Descartes, let alone the earth-centered Ptolemaic\ncosmology that had ruled the intellectual roost for centuries.\nThat\u2019s the kind of spectacular corroboration that propels a\nresearch programme into the lead. And it was a similarly novel\nprediction, spectacularly confirmed, that dethroned Newton\u2019s\nphysics in favour of Einstein\u2019s. Here\u2019s Lakatos again:\n\n\nThis programme made the stunning prediction that if one measures the\ndistance between two stars in the night and if one measures the\ndistance between them during the day (when they are visible during an\neclipse of the sun), the two measurements will be different. Nobody\nhad thought to make such an observation before Einstein\u2019s\nprogramme. Thus, in progressive research programme, theory leads to\nthe discovery of hitherto unknown novel facts. (S&P: 5.)\n\n\nA degenerating research programme, on the other hand (unlike the\ntheories of Newton and Einstein) either fails to predict novel facts\nat all, or makes novel predictions that are systematically falsified.\nMarxism, for example, started out as theoretically progressive but\nempirically degenerate (novel predictions systematically falsified)\nand ended up as theoretically degenerate as well (no more novel\npredictions but a desperate attempt to explain away unpredicted\n\u201cobservations\u201d after the event).\n\n\nHas\u2026Marxism ever predicted a stunning novel fact successfully?\nNever! It has some famous unsuccessful predictions. It predicted the\nabsolute impoverishment of the working class. It predicted that the\nfirst socialist revolution would take place in the industrially most\ndeveloped society. It predicted that socialist societies would be free\nof revolutions. It predicted that there will be no conflict of\ninterests between socialist countries. Thus the early predictions of\nMarxism were bold and stunning but they failed. Marxists explained all\ntheir failures: they explained the rising living standards of the\nworking class by devising a theory of imperialism; they even explained\nwhy the first socialist revolution occurred in industrially backward\nRussia. They \u201cexplained\u201d Berlin 1953, Budapest 1956,\nPrague 1968. They \u201cexplained\u201d the Russian-Chinese\nconflict. But their auxiliary hypotheses were all cooked up after the\nevent to protect Marxian theory from the facts. The Newtonian\nprogramme led to novel facts; the Marxian lagged behind the facts and\nhas been running fast to catch up with them. (S&P: 4\u20135.)\n\n\nThus good science is progressive and bad science is degenerating and a\nresearch programme may either begin or end up as such a degenerate\naffair that it ceases to count as science at all. If a research\nprogramme either predicts nothing new or entails novel predictions\nthat never come to pass, then it may have reached such a pitch of\ndegeneration that it has transformed into a pseudoscience.\n\nIt is sometimes suggested that in Lakatos\u2019s opinion no theory\neither is or ought to be abandoned, unless there is a better one in\nexistence (Hacking 1983: 113). Does this mean that no research\nprogramme should be given up in the absence of a progressive\nalternative, no matter how degenerate it may be? If so, this\namounts to the radically anti-sceptical thesis that it is better to\nsubscribe to a theory that bears all the hallmarks of falsehood, such\nas the current representative of a truly degenerate programme, than to\nsit down in undeluded ignorance. (The ancient sceptics, by contrast\nthought that it is better not to believe anything at all\nrather than believe something that might be false.) We are\nnot sure that this was Lakatos\u2019 opinion, though he clearly\nthinks it a mistake to give up on a progressive research\nprogramme, unless there is a better one to shift to. But consider\nagain the case of Marxism. What Lakatos seems to be suggesting in the\npassage quoted above, is that it is rationally\npermissible\u2014perhaps even obligatory\u2014to give up on Marxism\neven if it has no progressive rival, that is, if there is\ncurrently no alternative research programme with a set of\nhard core theses about the fundamental character of capitalism and its\nultimate fate. (After all, the later Lakatos probably subscribed to\nthe Popperian thesis that history in the large is systematically\nunpredictable. In which case there could not be a genuinely\nprogressive programme which foretold the fate of capitalism. At best\nyou could have a conditional theory, such as Piketty\u2019s, which\nsays that under capitalism, inequality is likely to\ngrow\u2014unless something unexpected happens or\nunless we decide to do something about it. See Piketty 2014:\n35.) So although Lakatos thinks that the scientific community seldom\ngives up on a programme until something better comes along, it is not\nclear that he thinks that this is what they always ought to\ndo.\n\nThere are numerous departures from Popperian orthodoxy in all this. To\nbegin with, Lakatos effectively abandons falsifiability as the\nDemarcation Criterion between science and non-science. A research\nprogramme can be falsifiable (in some senses) but unscientific and\nscientific but unfalsifiable. First, the falsifiable non-science.\nEvery successive theory in a degenerating research programme can be\nfalsifiable but the programme as whole may not be scientific. This\nmight happen if it only predicted familiar facts or if its novel\npredictions were never verified. A tired purveyor of old and boring\ntruths and/or a persistent predictor of novel falsehoods might fail to\nmake the scientific grade. Secondly, the non-falsifiable science. In\nLakatos\u2019s opinion, it need not be a crime to insulate the\nhard-core of your research programme from empirical refutation. For\nPopper, it is a sin against science to defend a refuted theory by\n\u201cintroducing ad hoc some auxiliary assumption, or by\nre-interpreting the theory ad hoc in such a way that it\nescapes refutation\u201d (C&R, 48). Not so for Lakatos, though\nthis is not to say that when it comes to ad hocery \u201canything\ngoes\u201d.\n\nThirdly, Lakatos\u2019s Demarcation Criterion is a lot more forgiving\nthan Popper\u2019s. For a start, an inconsistent research\nprogramme need not be condemned to the outer darkness as hopelessly\nunscientific. This is not because any of its constituent theories\nmight be true. Lakatos rejects the Hegelian thesis that there\nare contradictions in reality. \u201cIf science aims at truth, it\nmust aim at consistency; if it resigns consistency, it resigns\ntruth.\u201d But though science aims at truth and therefore\nat consistency, this does not mean that it can\u2019t put up with a\nlittle inconsistency along the way.\n\n\nThe discovery of an inconsistency\u2014or of an anomaly\u2014[need\nnot] immediately stop the development of a programme: it may be\nrational to put the inconsistency into some temporary, ad hoc\nquarantine, and carry on with the positive heuristic of the programme\n(FMSRP: 58).\n\n\nThus it was both rational and scientific for Bohr to persist\nwith his research programme, even though its hard core theses on the\nstructure of the atom were fundamentally inconsistent (FMSRP:\n55\u201358). So although Lakatos rejects Hegel\u2019s claim that\nthere are contradictions in reality (though not, perhaps in Reality),\nhe also rejects Popper\u2019s thesis that because\ncontradictions imply everything, inconsistent theories exclude nothing\nand must therefore be rejected as unfalsifiable and unscientific. For\nLakatos, Bohr\u2019s theory of the atom is fundamentally\ninconsistent, but this does not mean that it implies that the moon is\nmade of green cheese. Thus what Lakatos seems to be suggesting is here\n(though he is not as explicit as he might be) is that, when it comes\nto assessing scientific research programmes, we should sometimes\nemploy a contradiction-tolerant logic; that is a logic that rejects\nthe principle, explicitly endorsed by Popper, that anything whatever\nfollows from a contradiction (FMSRP: 58 n. 2). In today\u2019s\nterminology, Lakatos is a paraconsistentist (since he implicitly\ndenies that from a contradiction anything follows) but not a\ndialetheist (since he explicitly denies that there are true\ncontradictions). Thus he is neither a follower of Popper with respect\nto theories nor a follower of Hegel with respect to reality. (See\nPriest 2006 and 2002, especially ch. 7, and Brown and Priest\n2015.)\n\nThere is another respect in which Lakatos\u2019s Demarcation\nCriterion is more forgiving than Popper\u2019s. For Popper, if a\ntheory is not falsifiable, then it\u2019s not scientific and\nthat\u2019s that. It\u2019s an either/or affair. For Lakatos being\nscientific is a matter of more or less, and the more the less can vary\nover time. A research programme can be scientific at one\nstage, less scientific (or non-scientific) at another (if it ceases to\ngenerate novel predictions and cannot digest its anomalies) but can\nsubsequently stage a comeback, recovering its scientific status. Thus\nthe deliverances of the Criterion are matters of degree, and they are\nmatters of degree that can vary from one time to another. We can\nseldom say absolutely that a research programme is not scientific. We\ncan only say that it is not looking very scientifically healthy\nright now, and that the prospects for a recovery do not look\ngood. Thus Lakatos is much more of a fallibilist than Popper. For\nPopper, we can tell whether a theory is scientific or not by\ninvestigating its logical implications. For Lakatos our best guesses\nmight turn out to be mistaken, since the scientific status of a\nresearch programme is determined, in part, by its history, not just by\nits logical character, and history, as Popper himself proclaimed, is\nessentially unpredictable.\n\nThere is another divergence from Popper which helps to explain the\nabove. Lakatos collapses two of Popper\u2019s distinctions into one;\nthe distinction between science and non-science and the distinction\nbetween good science and bad. As Lakatos himself put the point in his\nlectures at the LSE:\n\n\nThe demarcation problem may be formulated in the following terms: what\ndistinguishes science from pseudoscience? This is an extreme way of\nputting it, since the more general problem, called the Generalized\nDemarcation Problem, is really the problem of the appraisal of\nscientific theories, and attempts to answer the question: when is one\ntheory better than another? We are, naturally, assuming a continuous\nscale whereby the value zero corresponds to a pseudo-scientific theory\nand positive values to theories considered scientific in a higher or\nlesser degree. (F&AM: 20)\n\n\nApart from the fact that, for Lakatos, a) it can be rational to\npersist with a \u201cfalsified\u201d theory, and indeed with theory\nthat is actually inconsistent\u2014both anathema to Popper\u2014and\nthat b) that for Lakatos \u201call theories are born refuted and die\nrefuted\u201d (S&P: 5) so that there are no unrefuted\nconjectures for the virtuous scientist to stick with (thus making what\nPopper would regard as good science practically impossible),\nLakatos\u2019s methodology of scientific research programmes replaces\ntwo of Popper\u2019s criteria with one. For Popper has\none criterion to distinguish science from non-science (or\nscience from pseudoscience if it is a theory with scientific\npretensions) and another to distinguish good science from bad\nscience. In Popper\u2019s view, a theory is scientific if it is\nempirically falsifiable and non-scientific if it is not. Being\nscientific or not is an absolute affair, a matter of either/or, since\na theory is scientific so long as there are some observations\nthat would falsify it. Being good science is a matter of\ndegree, since a theory may give more or less hostages to empirical\nfortune, depending on the boldness of its empirical predictions. For\nLakatos on the other hand, non-science or pseudo-science is at one end\nof a continuum with the best science at the other end of the scale.\nThus a theory\u2014or better, a research programme\u2014can start\nout as genuinely scientific, gradually becoming less so over the\ncourse of time (which was Lakatos\u2019s view of Marxism) without\naltogether giving up the scientific ghost. Was the Marxism of\nLakatos\u2019s day bad science or pseudo-science? From Lakatos\u2019\npoint of view, the question does not have a determinate answer, the\npoint being that it isn\u2019t good science since it\nrepresents a degenerating research programme. But although Lakatos\nevidently considered Marxism to be in bad way, he could not consign it\nto the dustbin of history as definitively finished, since (as he often\ninsisted) degenerating research programmes can sometimes stage a\ncomeback.\n",
