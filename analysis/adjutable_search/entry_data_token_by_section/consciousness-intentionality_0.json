    "main_text": "The Interpretation of \u201cConsciousness\u201d\n1. The Interpretation of \u201cConsciousness\u201d\n\nOn an understanding fairly common among philosophers, consciousness is\nthe feature that makes states count as experiences in a\ncertain sense: to be a conscious state is to be an experience. Widely\n(but not universally) accepted examples would include sensory states,\nimagery, episodic thought, and emotions of the sort we commonly enjoy.\nFor instance, when you see something red, it looks somehow to\nyou; when you hear a crash, it sounds somehow to you. Its\nlooking to you as it does, and its sounding to you as it does are\nexperiences in this sense. Likewise, when you close your eyes and\nvisualize a triangle, or when you feel pain, the visualizing and the\nfeeling are experiences. Similarly, you typically have experiences in\nthinking about how to answer a math problem, or what to say in an\nemail, in recalling where you parked the car, and in feeling anger,\nshame, relief, or elation. Experiences in this sense are said to have\nvarying \u201cphenomenal character\u201d for one who has them. Where\nfeelings are concerned, these would be the varying ways they feel to\nyou. However, not all experiences are classifiable as feelings. So\nmore broadly we might say that how you experience your own\nexperience\u2014how it is \u201csubjectively\nexperienced\u201d\u2014is its phenomenal (or its\n\u201csubjective\u201d) character.\n\nThe relevant notion is also often introduced by saying that there is,\nin a certain sense, always \u201csomething it is like\u201d to be in\na given conscious state\u2014something it\u2019s like for\none who is in that state\u2014and what it\u2019s like for you to be\nin a state is what makes it a conscious state of the kind it is. The\nphenomenal character of an experience is what someone would inquire\nabout by asking, e.g., \u201cWhat is it like to experience\norgasm?\u201d\u2014and it is what we speak of when we say that we\nknow what that is like, even if we cannot convey this to one\nwho doesn\u2019t know. Coordinating this with previous\nremarks: how you experience your experiences (e.g., how your feelings\nfeel to you) is what it is like for you to have them.\n\nOur understanding of what is meant by \u201cconscious\u201d might\nalso be sharpened by contrasting conscious states with what we can\nreadily conceive of keeping from their company. A leaf\u2019s fall\nfrom a tree branch, we will likely suppose, is not a conscious state\nof the leaf\u2014an experience in the desired sense. Nor, for that\nmatter, is a person\u2019s fall off a branch a conscious\nstate of that person. Rather, it is the feeling of falling\nthat is paradigmatically conscious, if anything is. Dreaming\nof falling would also be a conscious state in this sense. By contrast:\nwe can be said to sense (and so adjust) the position of our limbs when\ndreamlessly asleep. But this proprioception, we may suppose, is not\nconscious\u2014provided it does not feel anyhow to us sleepers, as it\ncommonly does when we are awake. And in general we may understand a\ncontrast between the familiar sensory experience we have of stimuli\n(when, say, these smell or sound somehow to us), and other\ndiscriminatory responses to the same stimuli in the absence of any\nsuch experience\u2014which we may still intelligibly describe as\nsensing or perceiving. (We can readily think of the sensing or\nperceiving attributed to plants and simple artifacts in this way.)\n\nThough the terms \u201cexperience\u201d and \u201csomething\nit\u201ds like for\u2026\u2019 are commonly used more or less in\nthe way just suggested to identify the notion of consciousness, it\nmust be said right off that their interpretation is subject to doubt\nand controversy that can affect one\u2019s fundamental ideas about\nthe topics treated here. Anyone wanting to think carefully about\nconsciousness must face the fact that the basic terms of discussion\nare infused with complex disagreements from the start.\n\nTo see how the notion of experience might occasion such\ndisputes, consider: Christopher Hill (2009) acknowledges that you may\nsay that both being struck by a thought (e.g., that the email you just\nreceived is a scam), and feeling a sensation (say, a tingling in your\nfoot) are \u201cexperiences\u201d. But he maintains this is\nambiguous: only the second is properly an experience, hence conscious,\nin the phenomenal sense. On this view, it seems episodic\nthought and sensation would count as univocally experiential, hence\nconscious, only if the former is identified with imagery. By contrast,\nCharles Siewert (2012a, 2014, 2021) holds thinking and sensing are\nindeed univocally experiences, though we should take care to\ndistinguish the relevant sense from others (such as we might find, for\nexample, in saying \u201csea slugs learn from experience\u201d and\n\u201cHurricane Sandy was quite an experience\u201d). Meanwhile,\nAlex Byrne 2009 voices skepticism about the very idea of experience in\nthe \u201cspecial philosophical\u201d sense.\n\nWhen it comes to the \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d locution, Hill\nand Siewert would agree that we can speak of there being something\nit\u2019s like to be in a state whose status as\nconscious, in the target sense, can hardly be taken for\ngranted. (As Jaegwon Kim 2011 points out, we can meaningfully ask\nsomeone what it was like for her to meet the President.) However,\nSiewert (2021) argues that we can surmount this difficulty, provided\nwe think of conscious states as ones there is unconditionally\nsomething it\u2019s like for one to be in. But Kim and Hill conclude\nthat the locution is simply ill-suited to give us a grip on the notion\nof consciousness, preferring terminology that Siewert, in turn, finds\nsuspicious; for them, conscious states are states with\n\u201cqualia\u201d, or \u201cqualitative character\u201d. (After\nC.I. Lewis 1929 introduced the term \u201cqualia\u201d for what is\ngiven sensorily to the mind prior to conceptualization, it became\ncommon to use it to speak of consciousness generally. See Crane (2019)\nand Keely (2009) for illuminating histories.)\n\nOther problems of interpretation complicate recent discussion in ways\nvery germane to the present topic. As suggested above, the\nexperiential/what it\u2019s like conception of consciousness is\nsometimes marked by the term \u201cphenomenal\u201d. The qualifier\nsuggests that there are other kinds of consciousness (or perhaps,\nother senses of \u201cconsciousness\u201d). Indeed there\nare, at least, other ways of introducing notions of\nconsciousness. And these may appear to pick out features or senses\naltogether distinct from that just presented. But their relationship\nis controversial. For example, it is said that some (but not all) that\ngoes on in the mind is \u201caccessible to consciousness\u201d. This\nmay encourage the thought that consciousness itself is nothing but a\ncertain kind of access to or accessibility of information\u2014for\ninstance, to a \u201cspeech center\u201d responsible for generating\n\u201cdirect verbal reports\u201d of the contents of one\u2019s\nstates of mind\u2014as in Daniel Dennett\u2019s early (1969)\ntheorizing about consciousness. And Ned Block (1995, 2001, 2002) has\nproposed that, on one understanding of \u201cconscious\u201d, (which\nhe finds at work in psychological theories) a conscious state is just\na \u201crepresentation poised\u201d (or as he later has it,\n\u201cbroadcast\u201d) \u201cfor free use in reasoning and other\ndirect \u2018rational\u2019 control of action (including\nreporting)\u201d. Block labels consciousness in this sense access\nconsciousness. (Early examples of theories he sees as employing\nthis notion include Baars 1997 and Dennett 1978, 1991.)\n\nBut what is the relationship between various kinds of information\naccess and consciousness in the phenomenal, experiential sense? Block\ndistinguishes the notions of phenomenal and access consciousness,\narguing that a mental representation\u2019s being poised or broadcast\nfor use in reasoning and rational control of action is neither\nconceptually necessary nor sufficient for the state\u2019s being\nphenomenally conscious. Similarly he distinguishes phenomenal\nconsciousness from what he calls \u201cmonitoring\nconsciousness\u201d\u2014where this has to do with one\u2019s\ncapacity to represent one\u2019s mind\u2019s to oneself; to have,\nfor example, thoughts about one\u2019s own thoughts, feelings, or\ndesires. One need not take Block\u2019s notions of phenomenal,\naccess, and monitoring consciousness to reflect clear, definite\ndistinctions already contained in our pre-theoretical use of the term\n\u201cconscious\u201d. Block himself suggests that (on the contrary)\nour initial, ordinary concept of consciousness is too confused (too\n\u201cmongrel\u201d) even to count as ambiguous. Thus in\narticulating an interpretation of the term adequate to frame\ntheoretical issues, we cannot simply describe how it is currently\nemployed (Block 1995, 2021).\n\nThough Block\u2019s proposed threefold distinction has proven\ninfluential, some would balk at proceeding on its basis. John Searle,\nfor example, would recognize phenomenal consciousness, but deny\nBlock\u2019s other two candidates are proper senses of\n\u201cconscious\u201d at all (Searle 1992). The dispute here may\nseem no more than terminological. However, Hill 2009 doubts there is a\nclear sense in which the information in all the states theorists want\nto count as conscious actually is continually being broadcast to some\ncontrol faculty. And this is to doubt the reality of access\nconsciousness, as often understood. The reality of the forms of\nmonitoring consciousness that figure in contemporary theories (such as\n\u201cinner sense\u201d) may also be doubted (Dretske 1995; Siewert\n1998, 2012b). Finally, some raise doubts that there is a properly\nphenomenal sense we can rightly apply to ourselves and\ndistinguish from the other two (see Dennett 1988, 1991; Rey 1997;\nFrankish 2016). So it seems the issues here are not trivially\nterminological. This is evident also when we consider the idea that\nwhile phenomenal consciousness is real, and our notion of this may be\ndistinguishable from those of access or monitoring, a proper theory of\nthese latter two explains what consciousness is\u2014what it\nconsists in. So, what it is for one to have a phenomenally conscious\nvisual experience of a color or shape, for example, is just for one to\nhave a visual representation of a certain (potentially unconscious)\ntype that is poised to affect belief (Tye 1995, 2002), or that\nfurnishes information of a restricted sort to a short term memory\nstore with a special role in behavioral control (Prinz 2012). Or it is\nto have the right sort of \u201chigher-order representation\u201d of\na visual state (Armstrong 1968; Rosenthal 2021; Carruthers 2000, 2004;\nLycan 1995, 2004). However, for some (Siewert 1998, 2010) recognizing\nnothing but access or monitoring in the manner of such theories\namounts to denying the reality of phenomenal consciousness. These are\nevidently not just disputes about words; they concern what there is to\ntalk about.\n\nFor the purposes of this survey we will assume there is a reasonable\ninterpretation of the remarks in the first three paragraphs of this\nsection under which they pick out something real for us to call\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d, even if this term may be legitimately\ninterpreted in other ways. But we should acknowledge it is open to\nquestion whether, when the philosophers here under discussion use the\nterm \u201cconscious\u201d, its cognates and their standard\ntranslations, they are all talking about consciousness in that sense.\nAnd we will leave open as much as possible how precisely to relate it\nto notions such as rational control, higher-order\nrepresentation, and conceptual activity\u2014disputed\nissues important to determining its relationship to intentionality, to\nbe encountered below in various guises.\n",
