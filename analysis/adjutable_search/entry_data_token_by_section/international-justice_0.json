    "main_text": "Early Cosmopolitanism\n1. Early Cosmopolitanism\n\nWe can begin, then, with John Rawls\u2019s A Theory of\nJustice. The influence of this work on modern political\nphilosophy can hardly be overstated. It shifted the assumptions with\nwhich political philosophers have operated\u2014in part by\nresuscitating the social contract tradition, and in part by giving a\nsustained and analytically robust argument regarding the injustice of\nparticular forms of economic inequality. A full analysis of\nRawls\u2019s work is beyond the scope of this entry; readers can see\nthe related entries in this encyclopedia for more detail. Rawls\nintroduces two principles of justice, which he argues represent the\nprinciples of justice we would accept as governing the \u201cbasic\nstructure\u201d of our society were we to bargain with one another\nunder fair conditions. These principles of justice include those\naddressing political justice, and with what fairness would demand of\nthe rules allocating persons to positions within the basic structure;\nthey also include principles designed to evaluate the justice of\nparticular forms of material inequality. In particular, the only\ninequalities of \u201cprimary goods\u201d that could be justified\nare those that can be shown to be to the advantage of the least\nadvantaged representative position. This idea\u2014called the\ndifference principle\u2014represents a significant constraint on the\nexercise of the market, in that individuals are no longer entitled to\nobtain whatever share of resources their talents might obtain in a\nstandard capitalist model of the labor market.\n\nIt is not part of our current project to criticize or defend the\ndifference principle. We are, instead, simply going to highlight two\nfacts about this principle. The first is that the principle does seem\nto place a significant constraint on the types and degrees of\ninequality that might be justifiable. The difference principle\nrequires that all such inequalities of social primary goods must be\njustifiable to the representative worst-off party within society;\nappeals to utility, or to efficiency, or to other forms of social\nvalue simply will not suffice. The second thing to note is that this\nprinciple is taken by its author to apply only within the context of\nthe domestic state. Rawls is explicit, in his theory, that his\nprinciples should be taken as only describing the nature of justice\nwithin the political society represented by a territorial state. When\nRawls does deal with the issue of international justice, it is in a\nmanner markedly less reformist than that with which he approaches\ndomestic justice. Rawls argues that a just international regime would\ninvolve states agreeing to treat one another fairly in their mutual\ninteraction\u2014but that this fairness would not involve any sort of\ndistributive consideration, or demand for economic justice. Indeed,\nRawls argues that the principles to which states would agree would\nlargely resemble those found in contemporary twentieth century\ninternational law. In contrast with the radical (or at least\nsurprising) conclusions drawn domestically, Rawls argues that in\ninternational justice, there would be \u201cno surprises\u201d in\nthe principles we ought to select (Rawls 1971: 378).\n\nThis difference in treatment between the domestic and the\ninternational context was immediately troubling to many philosophers.\nOne way of highlighting this is by noting the apparent contradiction\nbetween the universalism of Rawls\u2019s moral theory and the\nlocalism of its realm of application. The first argues that what is\nmorally arbitrary should not be taken as legitimately grounding an\ninequality of wealth or income. If liberalism means anything, after\nall, it means an aversion to inherited caste privilege and other forms\nof feudal birthright privilege (Carens 1992). The second, however,\napplies this universal guarantee only within the very local context of\nthe nation-state, ignoring the fact that membership in that state was,\nitself, morally arbitrary. The net result was, for many commentators,\na sort of internal inconsistency in Rawls\u2019s theory; if Rawls was\nto regard income inequality above that permitted by the difference\nprinciple as unjust, he should do so in a thoroughgoing way, and\ncondemn the inequalities between the wealthy and the impoverished\ninternationally (see Pogge 1989, 1992, 1994; Beitz 1979a,b, 1983;\nScanlon 1973).\n\nRawls can, on this account, be taken as the originator of the modern\ndialogue on global distributive justice\u2014not because he was the\nfirst to speak out against international inequality, but because he\ndid not do so. Many of those who first did speak about international\ninequality, though, used Rawlsian ideas and concepts in their\narguments. We can therefore proceed to examine some representative\narguments used by these thinkers, to see how their cases were\nconstructed.\n\nMany initial commentators on Rawls\u2019s work argued that the proper\ninterpretation of Rawls\u2019s principles was one in which the\ndifference principle was applied at the global level. These authors\nare often referred to as \u201ccosmopolitans\u201d; this term,\nhowever, is often less than illuminating (see the accompanying\n entry on cosmopolitanism\n for more detail). We will instead refer to these authors as Left\nInstitutionalists, for reasons we hope will become clear. Left\nInstitutionalists agree on the following conclusion: that\nRawls\u2019s own limitation of his two principles of justice to the\ncircumstances of a domestic society was a morally illegitimate\nconstraint on his theory, so that a consistent liberalism taking off\nfrom Rawls\u2019s arguments must apply its liberal principles at the\nglobal level\u2014and, therefore, the well-being of the worst-off\nrepresentative member of the global society, rather than the domestic,\nought to be our starting-point for the justification of inequality. In\nthis way, liberalism is made coherent with its ideals; rather than\nseeking some arbitrary fact to serve as a limitation on the liberal\ntheory of justice, the cosmopolitans argue that we ought to live up to\nthe globalism inherent in liberalism\u2019s self-understanding. See,\nfor instance, Thomas Pogge\u2019s analysis of liberalism\u2019s\ndomestic focus:\n\n\nNationality is just one further deep contingency (like genetic\nendowment, race, gender, and social class), one more potential basis\nof institutional inequalities that are inescapable and present from\nbirth. Within Rawls\u2019s conception, there is no reason to treat\nthis case differently from the others. And so it would seem that we\ncan justify our global institutional order only if we can show that\nthe institutional inequalities it produces tend to optimize (against\nthe backdrop of feasible alternative global regimes) the worst social\nposition. (Pogge 1989: 247)\n\n\nRawls, of course, had reasons to resist this interpretation of his\nwork. His own view\u2014made more explicit in his The Law of\nPeoples (1993), but present even in A Theory of\nJustice\u2014is that what counts as justice within a given\ncontext must make reference to what that context is, and how we should\nunderstand its function and its rules. Thus, Rawls argues that his\ntheory does not have application to such private institutions as\nchurches or universities; it is only to be applied to the basic\nstructure of a society\u2014which is understood by Rawls as the major\nsocial institutions, and the ways in which they structure the rules of\nassociation and allocate the advantages of cooperation (Rawls 1971:\n7). The first task of the cosmopolitan, then, is to analyze the notion\nof the basic structure, and demonstrate that such an entity is found\ninternationally as well as domestically. Charles Beitz and Thomas\nPogge both argue that the modern system of international trade has all\nthe indicia given by Rawls to explain what makes the basic structure\nso central: international institutions allocate the advantages of\ntrade, and their rules set the basic framework for the specific\ninteractions taken among international agents. They argue, in short,\nthat the international institutional set is indeed akin to a basic\nstructure, in that this set is a site of cooperation, to which the\nprinciples of justice given in A Theory of Justice ought to\napply. As Beitz has it:\n\n\n[I]f evidence of global economic and political interdependence shows\nthe existence of a global scheme of social cooperation, we should not\nview national boundaries as having fundamental moral significance.\nSince boundaries are not coextensive with the scope of social\ncooperation, they do not mark the limits of social obligation. Thus\nthe parties to the original position cannot be assumed to know that\nthey are members of a particular national society, choosing principles\nof justice primarily for that society. The veil of ignorance must\nextend to all matters of national citizenship, and the principles\nchosen will therefore apply globally. (Beitz 1979b: 151)\n\n\nRawlsian principles must therefore apply to the set of persons in the\nworld as a whole, so that global institutions should be arranged to\nmaximize the expectations of the globally worst-off representative\nindividual.\n\nThe early Rawlsian cosmopolitans were enormously influential, and can\nbe credited with forcing the attention of the philosophical community\ntowards the issue of global underdevelopment and inequality. The\ntheories, of course, were subject to enormous criticism, and Rawls\nhimself rejected their conclusions, as we shall see. For the moment,\nwe might note only that many theorists were skeptical of the\nconclusion that Rawls\u2019s principles could apply as easily to the\nglobal community as to the domestic community. Two strands of\ncriticism here deserve note: the first begins with coercion, and the\nsecond with the issue of nationality.\n\nSome thinkers, then, have questioned whether or not the simple act of\nexchanging goods\u2014even a great many goods\u2014places people in\na relationship that is morally akin to that shared by people who are\nliable to the same territorial state. Something like this point was\nnoticed early by Brian Barry, who notes that\n\n\n[T]rade, however multilateral, does not constitute a cooperative\nscheme of the relevant kind. Trade, if freely undertaken, is\n(presumably) beneficial to the exchanging parties, but it is not, it\nseems to me, the kind of relationship giving rise to duties of fair\nplay.\u2026Trade in pottery, ornamentation, and weapons can be\ntraced back to prehistoric times, but we would hardly feel inclined to\nthink of, say, the Beaker Folk as forming a single cooperative\nenterprise with their trading partners. No more did the spice trade\nunite East and West. (Barry 1982: 233)\n\n\nBarry\u2019s intuition, here, is that there seems to be something\nnormatively distinct between what is shared by trading partners and\nwhat is felt by fellow citizens. One way of noticing this is to notice\nthat some cosmopolitans sought to sever the distributive component of\nRawls\u2019s theory from the other aspects of that theory\u2014in\nparticular, from the parts of the theory dealing with political rights\nand political justification. There is, of course, a reason for this\ndismembering: there is, internationally, no polity, and the very\nconcept of having (for example) democratic rights within that polity\nmight seem misplaced. But many have thought that something has been\nmissed that is morally relevant, and that we might better regard\nRawls\u2019s distributive conclusions and his political conclusions\nas more tightly linked than that. Some thinkers, in particular, have\nargued that Rawls\u2019s conclusions are best read as principles\nintended to justify the coercive acts of a territorial state, rather\nthan as principles applicable to cooperative ventures more generally\n(Blake 2001, 2013; Nagel 2005). These theorists have suggested that\nthe state stands in need of justification, and that the justification\nwe offer makes distributive principles applicable here\u2014but not\neverywhere.\n\nThe other critical strand we wish to highlight began with the notion\nof nationality. The idea here is that the relationships that are most\ncentral to human flourishing and human creativity are always specific\nrelationships, with specific persons and with specific cultural\ncontexts. As such, the use of abstract principles like Rawls\u2019s\nto determine what we owe to one another generally is either suspect or\noutright self-destructive. This critical posture, of course, can end\nup being a criticism of the liberal project itself (see Sandel 1982).\nBut it can also end up being a simple criticism of the attempt to do\njustice without looking at the messiness of nations, of cultures, and\nof communities. These latter entities, it might be felt, are in need\nof support\u2014and, in particular, are in need of support by\nindividuals who are taken as duty-bound to prefer the good of that\ncommunity to the abstract rights of foreign citizens (D. Miller 1995;\nKymlicka 1995a). What is missed in the cosmopolitan argument, on this\naccount, is not the presence of the coercive state, but the presence\nof the cultural nation. The nationalists, it should be noted, are not\nhostile to all notions of global justice; they are, instead, committed\nonly to the relatively modest conclusion that nationality has some\nmoral relevance\u2014and that the principles of distributive justice\nthat are right within the nation may not be right at the global level\n(D. Miller 2007).\n\nThere are a variety of ways of arguing for such a conclusion. Some\ntheorists begin with dissatisfaction at the deracinated and abstract\nforms of philosophy practiced by cosmopolitans (Walzer 1983). Some\ntheorists begin with the need for communities to preserve themselves,\nif they are to provide individuals with the goods needed to live\ndecent lives (MacIntyre 1984). More generally, these theorists argue\nthat the needs of community are such that the cosmopolitan does damage\nto what is needed by actual humans, by considering individuals without\nconsidering the communities within which they live:\n\n\n[P]atriotism requires me to exhibit peculiar devotion to my nation and\nyou to yours. It requires me to regard such contingent social facts as\nwhere I was born and what government ruled over that place at that\ntime, who my parents were, who my great-grandparents were, and so on,\nas deciding for me what the question of virtuous action is\u2014at\nleast insofar as it is the virtue of patriotism which is in question.\nHence the moral standpoint and the patriotic standpoint are\nsystematically incompatible. (MacIntyre 1984: 5)\n\n\nBoth of these criticisms seem, to some degree, to be accepted by Rawls\nhimself, in his fuller explanation of his own international theory in\nThe Law of Peoples. Rawls is more explicit in this\nwork\u2014as he is in his 1993 volume Political\nLiberalism\u2014that he takes the political dimension of the\nstate as of primary importance, and that his principles of justice\napply only within the state for that reason. He is, further, more\nexplicit about his debt to the liberal nationalist idea in this\nvolume, writing approvingly that these ideas help guide his vision of\na just international regime. We may, then, proceed to examine\nRawls\u2019s Law of Peoples directly.\n",
