    "main_text": "Key Ethical Issues in Internet Research || Recruitment\n4.2 Recruitment\n\nDepending on the type of Internet research being carried out,\nrecruitment of participants may be done in a number of ways. As with\nany form of research, the study population or participants are\nselected for specific purposes (i.e., an ethnographic study of a\nparticular group on online game players), or, can be selected from a\nrange of sampling techniques (i.e., a convenience sample gleaned from\nthe users of Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing\n platform[4]).\n In the U.S. context, a recruitment plan is considered part of the\ninformed consent process, and as such, any recruitment script or\nposting must be reviewed and approved by an REB prior to posting or\nbeginning solicitation (if the project is human subjects research).\nFurther, the selection of participants must be impartial and unbiased,\nand any risks and benefits must be justly distributed. This concept is\nchallenging to apply in Internet contexts, in which populations are\noften self-selected and can be exclusive, depending on membership and\naccess status, as well as the common disparities of online access\nbased on economic and social variables. Researchers also face\nrecruitment challenges due to online subjects\u2019 potential\nanonymity, especially as it relates to the frequent use of pseudonyms\nonline, having multiple or alternative identities online, and the\ngeneral challenges of verifying a subject\u2019s age and demographic\ninformation. Moreover, basic ethical principles for approaching and\nrecruiting participants involve protecting their privacy and\nconfidentiality. Internet research can both maximize these\nprotections, as an individual may never be known beyond a screen name\nor avatar existence; or, conversely, the use of IP addresses,\nplacement of cookies, availability and access to more information than\nnecessary for the research purposes, may minimize the protections of\nprivacy and confidentiality.\n\nMuch recruitment is taking place via social media; examples include\npush technologies, a synchronous approach in which a text or tweet is\nsent from a researcher to potential participants based on profile\ndata, platform activity, or geolocation. Other methods of pull\ntechnologies recruitment include direct email, dedicated web pages,\nYouTube videos, direct solicitation via \u201cstickies\u201d posted\non fora or web sites directing participants to a study site, or data\naggregation or scraping data for potential recruitment. Regardless of\nthe means used, researchers must follow the terms of the\nsite\u2014from the specific norms and nuances governing a site or\nlocale to the legal issues in terms of service agreements. For\nexample, early pro-anorexia web sites (see Overbeke 2008) were often\ntreated as sensitive spaces deserving spcicial consideration, and\nresearchers were asked to respect the privacy of the participants and\nnot engage in research (Walstrom 2004). In the gaming context,\nReynolds and de Zwart (2010) ask:\n\n\nHas the researcher disclosed the fact that he or she is engaged in\nresearch and is observing/interacting with other players for the\npurposes of gathering research data? How does the research project\nimpact upon the community and general game play? Is the research\nproject permitted under the Terms of Service?\n\n\nColvin and Lanigan (2005: 38) suggest researchers\n\n\nSeek permission from Web site owners and group moderators before\nposting recruitment announcements, Then, preface the recruitment\nannouncement with a statement that delineates the permission that has\nbeen granted, including the contact person and date received. Identify\na concluding date (deadline) for the research study and make every\neffort to remove recruitment postings, which often become embedded\nwithin Web site postings.\n\n\nBarratt and Lenton, among others, agree:\n\n\nIt is critical, therefore, to form partnerships with online community\nmoderators by not only asking their permission to post the request,\nbut eliciting their feedback and support as well (2010: 71).\n\n\nMendelson (2007) and Smith and Leigh (1997) note that recruitment\nnotices need to contain more information than the typical flyers or\nadvertisements used for newspaper advertisements. Mentioning the\napproval of moderators is important for establishing authenticity, and\nso is providing detailed information about the study and how to\ncontact both the researchers and the appropriate research ethics\nboard.\n\nGiven the array of techniques possible for recruitment, the concept of\n\u201cresearch spam\u201d requires attention. The Council of\nAmerican Survey Research warns\n\n\nResearch Organizations should take steps to limit the number of survey\ninvitations sent to targeted respondents by email solicitations or\nother methods over the Internet so as to avoid harassment and response\nbias caused by the repeated recruitment and participation by a given\npool (or panel) of data subjects (CASRO 2011: I.B.3).\n\n\nUltimately, researchers using Internet recruitment measures must\nensure that potential participants are getting enough information in\nboth the recruitment materials and any subsequent consent documents.\nResearchers must ensure that recruitment methods do not lead to an\nindividual being identified without their permission, and if such\nidentification is possible, are there significant risks involved?\n",
