Debate across\nschool occurs especially on epistemological issues, but no author\nwrites on knowledge independently of the sort of metaphysical\ncommitment that defines the various classical systems\n(dar\u015bana), realist and idealist, dualist and monist,\ntheist and atheist, and so on. And every one of the dozen or so major\nschools from early in its history takes a position on knowledge and\njustification, if only, as with the Buddhist skeptic\n(Prasa\u1e45gika), to attack the theories of others.  There\nare nevertheless many common epistemological assumptions or attitudes,\nthe most striking of which is a focus on a belief\u2019s source in\nquestions of justification. Mainstream classical Indian epistemology\nis dominated by theories about pedigree, i.e., views about\nknowledge-generating processes, called\npram\u0101\u1e47a, \u201cknowledge sources.\u201d The\nprincipal candidates are perception, inference, and testimony. Other\nprocesses seem not truth-conducive or reducible to one or more of the\nwidely accepted sources such as perception and inference. However,\nsurprising candidates such as non-perception (for knowledge of\nabsences) and presumption (defended as distinct from\ninference) provoke complex arguments especially in the later\ntexts\u2014from about 1000 when the number of Sanskrit philosophical works\nof some of the schools begins to proliferate almost exponentially. The\nlater texts present more intricate views and arguments than the earlier\nfrom which the later authors learned. Classical Indian philosophy is an\nunbroken tradition of reflection expressed in the pan-Subcontinent\nintellectual language of Sanskrit.

Common Presuppositions of Classical Indian Schools\n\n\nCommonalities in the classical Indian approaches to knowledge and\njustification frame the arguments and refined positions of the major\nschools. Central is a focus on occurrent knowledge coupled with a\ntheory of \u201cmental dispositions\u201d called\nsa\u1e43sk\u0101ra. Epistemic evaluation of\nmemory, and indeed of all standing belief, is seen to depend upon the\nepistemic status of the occurrent cognition or awareness or awarenesses\nthat formed the memory, i.e., the mental disposition, in the first\nplace. Occurrent knowledge in turn must have a knowledge source,\npram\u0101\u1e47a.\n1.1 Knowledge and Knowledge Sources\n\n\nA common failure of translators rendering the technical terms of the\nIndian epistemological schools into the technical terms, or even not so\ntechnical, of English and analytic philosophy, is ignorance of the\nlatter. For example, several words, the most common of which is\n\u2018j\u00f1\u0101na\u2019, are standardly rendered with the\nword \u2018knowledge\u2019 in English (e.g., Bhatt 1989). However, proper\nSanskrit usage allows \u201cfalse\u201d j\u00f1\u0101na, whereas\nthere is no false knowledge as the words are used in (analytic)\nEnglish. There is a deeper lesson here than that translators should\nstudy Western philosophy, the lesson, namely, that although there may\nbe false j\u00f1\u0101na\u2014let us say \u201ccognition\u201d:\nthere are true and false cognition\u2014it is commonly assumed in everyday\nspeech as well as by the Indian epistemologists (with a few exceptions,\nnotably, the second-century Buddhist N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and certain\nfollowers including \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a, the\neleventh-century Advaitin) that cognition is ordinarily by nature true\nor veridical. It is error and falsity that are the deviations from the\nnormal and natural. That is to say, cognition is regarded as knowledge\nas a kind of conversational default\u2014and so to translate\n\u2018j\u00f1\u0101na\u2019 as \u201cknowledge\u201d turns out\nnot to be so bad after all. When the eighth-century Advaitin\n\u015aa\u1e45kara says that from the\nperspective of spiritual knowledge (vidy\u0101) the\nknowledge we recognize in everyday speech turns out to be illusory,\nmithy\u0101-j\u00f1\u0101na,\n\u201cfalse knowledge,\u201d this is supposed to be felt as almost a\ncontradiction in terms (Brahma-s\u016btra Commentary,\npreamble).\n\n\nNow it is argued by practically everyone (save the anti-epistemology\ngroup headed by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna) that at least everyday knowledge\nis proved by our unhesitating action\n(ni\u1e63kampa-prv\u1e5btti) to\nget what we want and avoid what we want to avoid. We would not so act\nif we had doubt, guided as we are by our knowledge. Belief, which\ncognition embeds, is tied to action, and action, in turn, blunts the\nforce of skepticism, it is pointed out in several of the classical\nschools. Buddhist Yog\u0101c\u0101ra as well as\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and (most)\nVed\u0101nta view knowledge as inherently known to be true. Even\nNy\u0101ya, a school championing a view of knowledge as unselfconscious\nof itself as true, subscribes to the epistemological principle of\n\u201cInnocent until reasonably challenged\u201d (a slight weakening of the\n\u201cInnocent until proven guilty,\u201d as pointed out, e.g., by Matilal 1986,\n314: \u201cVerbal reports \u2026 are innocent until proven guilty\u201d).\nSurprisingly (given the rancor in some exchanges across school), the\nsixth-century Ny\u0101ya philosopher Uddyotakara, who is famous for his\nattacks on Yog\u0101c\u0101ra positions, takes a similarly charitable\nattitude to be a rule applying to other philosophies: \u201cFor it is a rule\nwith systems (of philosophy) that a position of another that is not\nexpressly disproved is (to be regarded as) in conformity (with one\u2019s\nown)\u201d (under Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.4:\n125).\n\n\nKnowledge is cognition that has been produced in the right way.\nCognitions are moments of consciousness, not species of belief, but we\nmay say that cognitions form beliefs in forming dispositions and that\nveridical cognitions form true beliefs. A knowledge episode\u2014to speak\nin the Indian manner\u2014is a cognition generated in the right fashion.\nWhether this be because it is (as say the realists,\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, Ny\u0101ya,\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika) that it has the right\norigins in fact, or whether it is because it guides successful action\nin helping us get our desires satisfied (as say Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\nidealists and pragmatists), knowledge is cognition that arises in the\nright way. There are different theories of truth, but everyone sees\nknowledge as not only revealing the truth but arising from it.\nKnowledge episodes form non-occurrent knowledge (it is assumed, we may\nsay), and so an examination of what is crucial to the arising of a\nknowledge episode is crucial to the evaluations of epistemology.\nKnowledge cannot arise by accident. A lucky guess, though true or\nveridical, would not count as knowledge because it would not been\ngenerated in the right fashion, would not have the right pedigree or\netiology. The central notion throughout classical Indian epistemology\nis the \u201cknowledge source,\u201d pram\u0101\u1e47a,\nwhich is a process of veridical-cognition generation.\n\n\nNow the word \u2018pram\u0101\u1e47a\u2019\n(\u201cknowledge source\u201d) and the result\n\u2018pram\u0101\u2019 (\u201cknowledge\u201d; this is a\ntechnical usage that matches, practically perfectly, the analytic\nusages of \u2018knowledge\u2019 in English) along with the words\nused for individual knowledge sources, for perception and so on, are\ncommonly used such that the truth of the resultant cognition is\nimplied. This runs counter to English usage, along with broad\nphilosophic supposition, which is different with the words\n\u2018perception\u2019 and company. For no knowledge source ever\ngenerates a false belief. Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhists\u2014who\nsubscribe to the metaphysical view known as momentariness, which is a\npresentism (only things existing right now are real)\u2014claim that\nthere is no difference between source and result, process of knowledge\nand effect, pram\u0101\u1e47a and\npram\u0101. Thus there can be no wedge driven between cause\nand effect such that there could possibly be true belief by accident. The\nVedic schools (M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101,\nVed\u0101nta, Ny\u0101ya, Vai\u015be\u1e63ika,\nS\u0101\u1e43khya, Yoga) do distinguish knowledge from\ntrue belief but also see the concepts of truth and knowledge-producing process as\nwedded in that, as indicated, no genuine knowledge source ever produces\na false belief. Only pseudo-sources do. That is to say, no\nnon-veridical cognition is knowledge-source-generated. A knowledge\nsource is then not merely a reliable doxastic practice. Being merely\nreliable does not fit the bill. The concept of a knowledge source has a\ntruth logic, like \u2018knowledge\u2019 in English; it is factive. Maybe we\nshould say perception*, inference*, testimony* to render the classical\nIndian ideas. False testimony, for example, does not count as a\nknowledge-generator; the Sanskrit word for testimony is used only for\nwhat would be termed in English \u201cepistemically successful testimony,\u201d\ni.e., with a hearer having knowledge in virtue of a speaker telling the\ntruth. A non-veridical perception is not really a perception at all but\na \u201cpseudo-perception\u201d\n(pratyak\u1e63a-\u0101bh\u0101sa),\n\u201capparent perception,\u201d a perception imitator. You don\u2019t really\nsee an illusory snake; you only think you see one.\n1.2 The Touchstone of Everyday Speech\nEveryday patterns of speech\n(vyavah\u0101ra) are taken as a starting\npoint for theorizing in epistemology as in other areas of philosophy.\nSo, for example, perception and inference\u2014more exotic candidate\nsources, too\u2014are defended as veritable knowledge-generators by the\nobservation that people commonly regard them in that way. People cite a\nbelief\u2019s pedigree in questions of justification. Note that even in\nEnglish we do commonly recognize perception and some of the others as\ncertificational. Thus this seems to be a common human practice, not\nrestricted to classical Indian civilization, for sometimes we say, for\ninstance, \u201cS is indeed over there, since I see him,\u201d and \u201cYou couldn\u2019t\nreally have perceived S because condition Y does not hold\u201d (\u201cYou can\u2019t\nsee anyone from this distance\u201d). Habits of speech are reinforced by\nsuccess in action, classical theorists recognize in accepting the\npresumptive authority of common opinion. But \u201ca knowledge source\u201d may\nbe thought of as a technical term, one that entails factivity, as we\nhave seen, as a matter of definition. Similarly with justification\n(pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya), the having of\nwhich, if veritable (or objective), as opposed to the apparent\n(\u0101bh\u0101sa), means that the justified\ncognition is true.\n1.3 Knowledge and World-Transcendence\nThere is much controversy over the religious goal of life among the\nseveral schools, both among schools accepting Vedic culture (liberation\nvs. heaven, individual dissolution into the Absolute Brahman, blissful\nyogic \u201cisolation,\u201d kaivalya, enjoyment of God\u2019s presence) and\namong outsider schools (Buddhist\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a or becoming a\nbodhi-sattva or a Jaina arhat as well as\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka\u2019s entire rejection of soteriology). But from a\ndistance, we can see common conceptions linking at least many of the\nIndian views. One is to draw a distinction between everyday and\nspiritual knowledge and to theorize about their relationship. A\nprominent position is that thinking about the world is an obstacle to\nspiritual enlightenment. Another is that proper understanding of the\nworld helps one disengage and to know oneself as separate from material\nthings, and so is an aid to transcendence. The most distinctive form of\nskepticism in classical Indian thought is that so-called worldly\nknowledge is not knowledge at all but is a perversion or deformation of\nconsciousness. Who seems a philosophical skeptic is really a saint\nhelping us achieve our truly greatest good of world-transcendence by\nhelping us see paradoxes and other failures of theory.\n2. Skepticism\nWith an eye to the alleged power of inference to prove the\nexistence of God or personal survival, the C\u0101rv\u0101ka\nmaterialist school recognizes perception as a knowledge source but not\ninference nor any other candidate. Inference depends upon\ngeneralizations which outstrip perceptual evidence, everything F as a\nG. No one can know that, C\u0101rv\u0101ka claims. Testimony is also no\ngood since it presupposes that a speaker would tell the truth and\nthus is subject to the same criticism of lack of evidence. And so on\nthrough the other candidates (M\u0101dhava,\nSarva-dar\u015bana-sa\u1e43graha). The\nstandard response is pragmatic. We could not act as we do if we could\nnot rely on inference (etc.) albeit inference does depend on\ngeneralization that (often, not invariably) outstrips experience. The\nskeptic himself relies on such generalizations when he opens his mouth\nto voice his skepticism, by using words with repeatable meanings\n(Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba, inference\nchapter, Tattva-cint\u0101-ma\u1e47i).\nThe C\u0101rv\u0101ka argument identifying the problem of induction\nis turned by both Buddhist and Ny\u0101ya philosophers into an argument\nfor fallibilism about inference. What we take to be the result of a\ngenuine inference may turn out to hinge on a fallacy, a\nhetv-\u0101bh\u0101sa, an apparent but misleading \u201creason\u201d or\nsign (see the section below on inference). But to accept that sometimes\nwe reason in ways that mimic but fail to instantiate right forms is not\nto be a skeptic. Indeed, the very concept of a fallacy\n(hetv-\u0101bh\u0101sa) presupposes that of the veritable\nreason or sign (hetu), a veritable prover making us have new\nknowledge.\n\nA different kind of skepticism is broader in scope, not restricted to\ninference or other candidate sources. It appears both in Buddhism and\nAdvaita Ved\u0101nta, but let us rehearse only the Buddhist version. By\ndiscerning absurdities that arise in viewing anything as having an\nindependent existence, one realizes, as N\u0101g\u0101rjuna says, that\neverything is ni\u1e25svabh\u0101va, \u201cwithout a\nreality of its own.\u201d Applying this to oneself, one comes to see the\ntruth of the Buddha\u2019s teaching of an\u0101tman, \u201cno-self,\u201d\nwhich is viewed as a decisive step toward the summum bonum of\nenlightenment and perfection\n(praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101). In\nparticular, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna identifies a problem of a justification\nregress in the pram\u0101\u1e47a program\n(Vigraha-vyav\u0101rtin\u012b, v. 33), which assumes\nthat process and result can be separated, along with various conundra\nor paradoxes concerning relations (such as the so-called Bradley\nproblem). The Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra argues that the\nN\u0101g\u0101rjunian type of skepticism is self-defeating (4.2.26\u201336),\nbut many of the problems identified by the Buddhist (and his\nintellectual inheritors such as\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a) occupy the\nreflections of philosophers for centuries, Buddhist as well as\nNy\u0101ya and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 among Vedic schools in particular.\n\n3. Knowing That You Know\n\n\nOne of the philosophic problems that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna raised for\nepistemology has to do with an alleged regress of justification on the\nassumption that a pram\u0101\u1e47a is\nrequired in order to know and that to identify the source of a bit of\nknowledge is to certify the proposition embedded. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\nclaims that this is absurd in that it would require an infinite series\nof pram\u0101\u1e47a, of identification of a\nmore fundamental pram\u0101\u1e47a for every\npram\u0101\u1e47a relied on.\n\n\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Ved\u0101nta\nphilosophers argue that such a threat of regress shows that knowledge\nis self-certifying, svata\u1e25\npr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya. Ved\u0101ntins connect\nthe Upanishadic teaching of a truest or deepest self\n(\u0101tman) as having \u201cself-illumining awareness\u201d\n(sva-prak\u0101\u015ba) with a\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 epistemological theory\nof self-certification: at least in the case of spiritual knowledge\n(vidy\u0101) awareness is self-aware. From this it follows\nthat only awareness is right concerning all questions about awareness,\nsince only awareness itself has, so to say, access to itself. Awareness\nitself is the only consideration relevant to any question about\nawareness itself, its existence or its nature.\n\n\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 defends Vedic truth\nby claiming that knowledge of it wears its certification on its sleeve\nlike everyday knowledge where the initial credibility of an occurrent\ncognition seems practically absolute. According to Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (from the late seventh\ncentury), no cognition that in itself purports to be veridical is\nindeed non-veridical; no cognition is absolutely wrong but at worst a\nconfusion. The same causal nexus that produces a veridical cognition\nproduces knowledge of its veridicality. According to\nBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (deriving from\nKum\u0101rila, Prabh\u0101kara\u2019s teacher), veridicality is known\nthrough the process of inference whereby a cognition itself would be\nknown as having occurred. A cognition, which is an act, produces a\nfeature in the object it cognizes, a \u201ccognizedness,\u201d and then from\napprehension of this feature both the original cognition and its\nveridicality are known. Certification is thus intrinsic to a\ncognition\u2019s being known, that is, with cognitions that are veridical.\nWith respect to knowledge of non-veridicality, extrinsic certification\nis necessary.\n\n\nNy\u0101ya takes an extrinsicality view of certification\n(parata\u1e25\npr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya)\u2014it denies that\nKp entails KKp; to know that you know requires\napperceptive certification\u2014and so seems vulnerable to the regress\ncharge. The solution involves the notion of \u201capperception\u201d\n(anuvyavas\u0101ya), which is a second-level cognition that\nhas another cognition as its object without\nitself being self-aware. Certification, psychologically considered,\ninvolves apperception, a seeing that a challenged, target cognition is\nfalse or true.\n\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana (fourth century, whose\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra commentary is the oldest extant)\nexpressly rebuts the regress charge (we do sometimes certify our claims\nwithout having to certify the certifiers) under\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 2.1.20 (448\u201349, translation\nmine):\n\n\nIf comprehension of perception or another (knowledge source) landed us\nin infinite regress, then everyday action and discourse would not go\non through comprehension of self-consciously known objects and their\nknown causes. (However) everyday action and discourse do proceed for\nsomeone comprehending self-consciously known objects and their known\ncauses: when (self-consciously) I grasp by perception an object or I\ngrasp one by inference or I grasp one by analogy or I grasp one by\ntradition or testimony (the four knowledge sources according to\nNy\u0101ya), the (apperceptive) cognition that occurs goes like this:\n\u201cMy knowledge is perceptual\u201d or \u201cMy knowledge is\ninferential\u201d or \u201cMy knowledge is from analogy\u201d or\n\u201cMy knowledge is testimonial.\u201d\n\nAnd motivation to seek righteousness (dharma), wealth,\npleasure, or liberation proceeds through these comprehensions (whereas\nif there is doubt, no such goal-directed activity would occur), as\nlikewise motivation to reject their opposites. Everyday discourse and\naction would cease (to be possible for such a subject) if what is\nalleged were indeed to hold (justificational regress).\n\n\nNy\u0101ya\u2019s strategy is then (1) to charge the objector with making a\n\u201cpragmatic contradiction,\u201d (2) to take veridicality as cognitive\ndefault, and (3) to certify cognitions by source identification as well\nas by inference from the success or failure of the activity that they\nprovoke and guide. We assume without checking that our cognition is\nveridical, but sometimes we need to check. Note that the practical\npursuits that V\u0101tsy\u0101yana mentions as guided by second-order,\nreflective knowledge are: \u201crighteousness (dharma), wealth,\npleasure, [and] liberation.\u201d\n\n4. Perception\n\n\nAll the classical schools that advance epistemologies accept\nperception as a knowledge source although there is much disagreement\nabout its nature, objects, and limitations. Are the objects of\nperception internal to consciousness or external? Are they restricted\nto individuals, e.g., a particular cow, or are universals, e.g.,\ncowhood, also perceived? How about relations? Absences or negative\nfacts (Devadatta\u2019s not being at home)? Parts or wholes? Both? A self,\nawareness itself? There are issues about perceptual media such as light\nand ether, \u0101k\u0101\u015ba, the purported medium\nof sound, and about what is perceptible yogically (God, the\n\u012b\u015bvara, the \u0101tman or\nself, puru\u1e63a). What are the environmental\nconditions that govern perception, and how do these connect with the\ndifferent sensory modalities? Are there internal conditions on\nperception (such as attention or focus, viewed by some as a voluntary\nact)? Is a recognition, e.g., \u201cThis is that Devadatta I saw yesterday,\u201d\nperceptual? And does it prove the endurance of things over time\nincluding the perceiving subject? Do we perceive only fleeting\nqualities (dharma), as Buddhists tend to say, or qualifiers as\nqualifying qualificanda (a lotus as qualified by being-blue), as say\nrealist Ny\u0101ya and\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101? Does all perception\ninvolve a sensory connection with an object that is responsible for\nproviding its content or intentionality\n(nir\u0101k\u0101ra-v\u0101da, Ny\u0101ya), or is the content\nof perception internal to itself (s\u0101k\u0101ra-v\u0101da,\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra)? How do we differentiate veritable perception,\nwhich is defined as veridical, and pseudo-perception (illusion), which\nis non-veridical? How is illusion to be explained? These are some of\nthe outstanding issues and questions that occupy the schools in all\nperiods of their literatures.\n\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra subjectivism views perception as\n\u201cconcept-free,\u201d whereas the holist grammarian\nBhart\u1e5bhari of the third century finds it all to be clothed in\nlanguage.  M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Ny\u0101ya realists\nemphasize the \u201cconcept-laden\u201d nature of at least the type\nof perception that is epistemically foundational for observation\nstatements containing basic sensory predicates. To be sure,\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and later Ny\u0101ya also admit\nconcept-free perception. Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da mentions the\ncognition of an infant as an example\n(\u015aloka-v\u0101rttika commentary on the perception\ns\u016btra of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101-s\u016btra,\nverse 112, p. 94; see also Matilal 1986, 321\u2013322). Phenomenologically\nhumans would seem to have much in common with infants and animals\nconsidering this type of perception. But according to the great\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka, perception does not so much divide into\ntypes as form a process with the concept-free as the first\nstage. Awareness of the object is only quasi-propositional in the\nfirst moment, and at the second has its content filled out to become\nthe means whereby an individual is ascertained to have a certain\ncharacter, to be a certain kind of substance or to possess a universal\nor an action, etc. (verse 120, p. 96). The object perceived, the lotus\n(or whatever), is known in the first stage as an individual whole,\nboth in its individuality and as having a character. But the\ncharacter, the thing\u2019s being blue as opposed to red, and its being\nhere right now, are not known without the mediation of concepts which\nare supplied internally. Seeing is ultimately \u201cseeing as\u201d\nand is \u201cshot through with words,\u201d to use the expression of\nBhart\u1e5bhari (V\u0101kyapad\u012bya, ch. 1, verses\n123\u2013124, p. 199; see also Matilal 1986, 342). However, the mind or\nself does not, according to the realists, have any innate ideas\n(unlike then Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, which postulates a collective\n\u201cstorehouse\nconsciousness,\u201d \u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na).\nConcepts are the records of previous experiences.\n\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra holds that all predication, including the\nsensory, depends on ideas of unreal generality. All predication\ninvolves repeatable general terms. Thus the realists\u2019 \u201cpropositional\ncontent\u201d is suspicious just because this is not raw perception which\nalone is capable of presenting the truly real, the\nsva-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a, \u201cthat\nwhich is its own mark,\u201d the unique or particular. Classical Indian\nrealists hold that perception is none the worse for being concept-laden\nin that concepts are features of the world as impressed upon the mind\nor self. Perception founds true beliefs, and the repeatable predicates\nand concepts (cowhood) perceptually acquired and re-presented and\nemployed in verbalizations pick out constituents of real objects,\nthings that do re-occur (there are lots of cows in the world). For late\nNy\u0101ya philosophers, concept-laden perception comes so to dwarf in\nimportance the indeterminate, concept-free variety that the latter\nbecomes problematic. Perception in its epistemological role is\nconcept-laden. Otherwise, it could not be certificational. Perception\nas a knowledge source is a doxastic, belief-generating process. Beliefs\n(or anyhow perceptual cognitions and their verbalizations) are\ndependent on concepts (to believe or say that there is a pot on the\nfloor, one must possess the concepts of \u201cpot\u201d and \u201cfloor\u201d).\n\nThe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhists\u2019 best argument for their\nsubjectivism\u2014which one suspects derives more fundamentally from a\ncommitment to the possibility of a universal\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a experience, although this is\nnot said\u2014is perceptual illusion. Illusion proves that a perception\u2019s\nobject is not a feature of the world but is contributed somehow from\nthe side of the subject. A rope can be perceived as a snake, with no\ndifference, from the perspective of the perceiver, between the illusion\nand a veridical snake perception. Similarly, dreams are the\n\u201cperceptions\u201d of a dreamer but do not touch reality. (Our world is a\ndream, say Buddhists, and we should try to become buddha,\n\u201cAwakened.\u201d)\n\nOne way to resist the pull of the illusion argument belongs to\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nwhich insists that not only is perception invariably veridical but also\ncognition in general, j\u00f1\u0101na. Ny\u0101ya\nphilosophers hold in contrast that illusion is a false cognition. Rich\ndebate occurs over Ny\u0101ya\u2019s \u201cmisplacement\u201d view of illusion and a\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara \u201cno-illusion\u201d or \u201comission\u201d theory (illusion is a\nfailure to cognize of a certain sort, an absence of cognition, for\nexample, an absence of cognition of the difference between a\nremembering of silver and a perceiving of mother-of-pearl when holding\nin hand a piece of shell S exclaims, \u201cSilver!\u201d). Here Ny\u0101ya agrees\nwith the subjectivists: sometimes a person S apparently perceives\na to be F\u2014has an apparently perceptual cognition embedding\nFa\u2014when a is not in fact F, while S cannot discern\nfrom her own first-person perspective that the cognition is\nnon-veridical. Nevertheless, the predication content, according to\nNy\u0101ya as also M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101,\nthe presentation or indication of F-hood, originates in things\u2019 really\nbeing F, through previous veridical experience of F-hood.\n\nHere we touch the heart of classical Indian realism. Snakehood is\navailable to become illusory predication content through previous\nveridical experience of snakes. It gets fused into a current perception\nby means of a foul-up in the normal causal process through the arousing\nof a snakehood memory-disposition\n(sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) formed by previous\nexperience. The content or intentionality\n(vi\u1e63ayat\u0101, \u201cobjecthood\u201d) of an\nillusion is to be explained causally as generated by real features of\nreal things just as is genuine perception though they are distinct\ncognitive types. Illusion involves the projection into current\n(determinate) cognition (which would be pseudo-perception) of\npredication content preserved in memory. Sometimes the fusion of an\nelement preserved in memory is cross-sensory, tasting sourness, for\ninstance, when perceiving a lemon by sight or smelling a piece of\nsandalwood which is seen at too far a distance for actual olfactory\nstimulation. These are cases of veridical perception with an obvious\nadmixture or tinge of memory. Illusion, according to Ny\u0101ya, is to\nbe analyzed similarly, but unlike veridical cases of projection\nillusion involves taking something to be what it is not, a seeing or\nperceiving it through a \u201cmisplaced\u201d qualifier. This means that\nconcept-laden perception is necessarily combinational\u2014a position taken\nby Gautama himself, the \u201cs\u016btra-maker,\u201d and much elaborated\nby V\u0101tsy\u0101yana and the other commentators in text apparently\naimed at an early form of Buddhist subjectivism\n(Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra 4.2.26\u201336). The upshot of these\ns\u016btras is that, first, the concept of illusion is\nparasitic on that of veridical experience (not all coins can be\ncounterfeit), and, second, that illusion shows a combinational\n(propositional) structure: this is a something or other. According to\nNy\u0101ya, perceptual illusion is right in part, that there is\nsomething there, but wrong about what it is. Ontologically, Ny\u0101ya takes a disjunctivist position: an illusion is a different kind of critter than a genuine perception, since its intentionality is different.\n\n\nTo fill out the realist account in late Ny\u0101ya, thought-laden\nperception, determinate perception, gets its content or intentionality\u2014its \u201cobject-directedness\u201d\u2014not only from the\nobject in connection with the sense organ but also from the\nclassificational power of the mind (or self). With the perceptual\ncognition, \u201cThat\u2019s a pot,\u201d for instance, the pot as an individual in\nconnection with a sensory faculty is responsible for the awareness of a\nproperty-bearer, for what is called the qualificandum portion of the\nperception, without admixture of memory. But the sensory connection is\nnot by itself responsible for the qualifier portion, the pothood, that\nis to say, the thing\u2019s classification as a pot. A qualificandum as\nqualified by a qualifier is perceived all at once\n(eka-v\u1e5btti-vedya), but a determinate\nperception\u2019s portions have distinct etiologies. Now the\nclassificational power of the mind (or self) is not innate, as pointed\nout, but is rather the product of presentational experience\n(anubhava) over the course of a subject\u2019s life. Repeatable\nfeatures of reality get impressed on the mind (or self) in the form of\nmemory dispositions. For most adults, prior determinate cognition\nis partly responsible for the content predicable of a particular, or a group of things,\npresented through the senses. That is, in perceiving a as an\nF, an F-sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra formed by previous\nknowledge-source-produced bits of occurrent cognition of things F would\nbe a causal factor. The perception\u2019s own content includes the\nrepeatable nature of the qualifier through the operation of this\nfactor. We see the tree as a tree.\n\nBut sometimes neither a prior determinate cognition nor a memory\ndisposition is at all responsible for the predication content, for example, when a\nchild sees a cow for the very first time. Rather, an \u201cin the raw\u201d\nperceptual grasping of the qualifier (cowhood) delivers it to an\nensuing concept-laden and verbalizable perception. In other words,\nthere are cases of determinate cognition where\nindeterminate, concept-free perception furnishes the qualifier independently and the\nensuing concept-laden perception is not tinged by memory. Normally,\nsa\u1e43sk\u0101ra, \u201cmemory-dispositions,\u201d do\nplay a causal role in determinate perception, according to Ny\u0101ya\nand M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and indeed\nepistemologists of all flags. But sometimes an immediately prior\nconcept-free perception of a qualifier plays the role of the\nsa\u1e43sk\u0101ra, furnishing by itself the concept, the\npredication content, the qualifier portion of an ensuing determinate,\nproposition-laden perception, which is the type of cognition that\nfounds our beliefs about the world.\n\nIf this were not an \u201cimmaculate perception\u201d but itself a grasping of a\nproperty through the grasping of another property, we would be faced\nwith an infinite regress and direct perception of the world would be\nimpossible. Concept-free perception need not provide the classifying not\nonly with second and third-time perceptions of something as F but not\neven, strictly speaking, with a first-time perception, since there\ncould be an intervening cognitive factor (provided, say, by analogy:\nsee below). But with that factor again the question would arise how it\ngets its content, and so since an indeterminate perception has to be\nposited at some point to block a regress it might as well be at the\nstart. This is the main argument of\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, the late Ny\u0101ya\nsystematizer, in defense of positing the concept-free as a type or\nfirst stage of perception (Phillips 2001).\n\nNevertheless, for all intents and purposes, perception embodies\nbeliefs, according to the realists. More accurately, a perceptual\nbelief is the result of the operation of perception as a knowledge\nsource. Everything that is nameable is knowable and vice-versa. There\nis nothing that when we attend to it cannot bear a name, for we can\nmake up new names. We can in principle verbalize the indications of our\nexperience, though many of them are not named since we are indifferent\n(pebbles perceived along the road). Concept-free perception is the\nclassical Indian realist rendering of our ability to form perceptual\nconcepts by attending to perception\u2019s phenomenological side.\nEpistemologically, it plays no role, since it is itself a posit and is\nunverbalizable and not directly apperceived (A. Chakrabarti 2000 gives\nthis and other reasons for jettisoning the concept from Ny\u0101ya\u2019s\nown realist point of view).\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra takes issue with the realist theory\nof perception, viewing all perception as concept-free. What is\nperceived is only the unqualified particular,\nsva-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a. The\nrealists\u2019 \u201cqualifiers\u201d such as cowhood are mental constructions,\n\u201cconvenient fictions.\u201d Various reductio arguments are put forth to show\nthe incoherence of the realists\u2019 conception of a qualificandum\nperceived at once to be qualified by a qualifier\n(eka-v\u1e5btti-vedya). The different views of\nthe objects of perception feed different views of inference.\n5. Inference\n\n\nLogic is developed in classical India within the traditions of\nepistemology. Inference is a second knowledge source, a means whereby\nwe can know things not immediately evident through perception. Oetke\n(2004) finds three roots to the earliest concerns with logic in India:\n(1) common-sense inference, (2) establishment of doctrines in the frame\nof scientific treatises (\u015b\u0101stra), and (3)\njustification of tenets in a debate. The three of these come together\n(though the latter two are predominant) within the epistemological\ntraditions in an almost universal regard of inference as a knowledge\nsource.\n\nSeeing classical Indian logic as part of epistemology, as explaining\nhow we know facts through the mediation of our knowledge of other\nfacts, makes it easy to understand why both the Buddhist and Vedic\nschools count a valid but unsound argument as fallacious: knowledge\nis not generated. Classical Indian philosophers are not focused on logic\nper se, but rather on a psychological process whereby we come to know\nthings indirectly, by way of a sign, hetu or\nli\u1e45ga, an indication of something\ncurrently beyond the range of the senses, whether at a distance\nspatially or temporally or of a sort (such as atoms or God or the\nBuddha mind) that by nature cannot be directly perceived.\n\nThe two greatest names for classical Indian logic belong to logicians\nof the Buddhist Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school, Dign\u0101ga (sixth century)\nand Dharmak\u012brti (early seventh century). Dign\u0101ga laid\nout all the possible relationships of inclusion and exclusion for the\nextensions of two terms called the prover or \u201csign,\u201d hetu, and\nthe probandum, s\u0101dhya, the property \u201cto be proved.\u201d\nThereby he revealed the underpinnings of the\npram\u0101\u1e47a of inference in terms of\nsets of particulars, which, according to Yog\u0101c\u0101ra ontology,\nare the only reals. Dharmak\u012brti classified inferences based\non the ontological nature of the class-inclusion relationship that\nunderpins all inference as a knowledge source. Earlier philosophers,\nboth Buddhist and non-Buddhist, provide examples of everyday reasoning,\nseveral of which are abductive in character, informal reasoning to the\nbest explanation, from sight of a swollen river, for example, says\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana in his commentary on the inference\ns\u016btra (1.1.5) of the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra, to the conclusion that it has\nrained upstream. But there are also instances of inferences comprised\nof deductive, extrapolative, and sometimes properly inductive reasoning\non topics of everyday life as well as philosophy in numerous\npre-Dign\u0101ga texts of several schools. It is not true, as is\nsometimes claimed, that no one before Dign\u0101ga had the notion of an\ninference-underpinning \u201cpervasion,\u201d vy\u0101pti, of a prover\nproperty by a property to be proved. Dign\u0101ga does however get the\ncredit for the earliest systematization, which employs three terms, a\nsite or subject of a proposed inference\n(pak\u1e63a, the mountain in the stock example\nof an inference from sight of smoke on a mountain to knowledge of fire\non the mountain), the prover or prover property (hetu,\nsmokiness), and the probandum (s\u0101dhya, fieriness).\n\n\nDign\u0101ga, it should be stressed, as a nominalist sees inference\nas proceeding from knowledge of particulars to other knowledge of\nparticulars (avoiding the universals of the realists, as nicely\nexplained by Hayes 1988 with reference to the Buddhist apoha,\n\u201cexclusion,\u201d theory of concepts). Dign\u0101ga formulates a threefold\ntest for a good prover, trair\u016bpya-hetu:\n\nthe prover\u2019s occurrence on the inferential subject of a proposed inference must\nbe known to the subject S\nthe prover\u2019s occurrence at least once together with the probandum\nmust be known to S\nno counter-case of a prover occurring without the probandum must\nbe known to S.\n\n\n\nUddyotakara in his Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra commentary\nincorporates Dign\u0101ga\u2019s ideas to formalize many of\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana\u2019s informal inferences. The Ny\u0101ya philosopher\nowes almost everything to his Buddhist adversaries, as opposed to his\nNy\u0101ya predecessors, but he does criticize and alter what he sees\nas the certification conditions of inference as a knowledge source,\ncombining Dign\u0101ga\u2019s second and third tests into a single\nrequirement, knowledge of pervasion. He also adds a third condition,\nthe subject\u2019s having to \u201creflect\u201d and put the information together, so\nto say:\n\npak\u1e63a-dharmat\u0101: the prover\nhas to be known to S as qualifying the inferential subject\nvy\u0101pti-smara\u1e47a: the prover\u2019s\nbeing pervaded by the probandum has to be remembered by S\nli\u1e45ga-par\u0101mar\u015ba: S\nmust connect by reflection the pervasion with the inferential subject.\n\n\n\nThe upshot of the addition may be interpreted as the recognition\nthat knowledge is not closed under deduction considered in abstraction\nfrom the psychological process of \u201creflection.\u201d But through that\nprocess, epistemic warrant\u2014or \u201ccertainty,\u201d\nni\u015bcaya\u2014passes from premises to conclusion, and\nwe act unhesitatingly, for example, to put a fire on yonder mountain\nout.\n\n\nThings are yet more complicated. Inferential knowledge is defeasible,\nor, more precisely stated, what a subject takes to be inferential\nknowledge may turn out to be pseudo, non-genuine, a false cognition\nimitating a true one, or even in Gettier-style cases an accidentally\ntrue cognition masquerading as one genuinely inference-born. Knowledge\nhas a social dimension. Not only would awareness of a counterexample\nbe a defeater, but also if someone were to present a counterinference\nto a conclusion opposed to ours, no longer would we have inferential\nknowledge. Awareness of any of several kinds of \u201cblocker\u201d\nof \u201creflection\u201d can undermine the generalization on which\nsuch reflection depends. There are potential preventers of inferential\nawareness, \u201cdefeaters,\u201d b\u0101dhaka, leading to\nbelief relinquishment by someone who has hitherto not noticed a\ncounterexample or the like and who has thus drawn a conclusion\nerroneously.\n\n\nHowever, one should not think that the epistemologists\u2019 inference is\nnon-monotonic, as established by Taber (2004) against Oetke (1996) in\nparticular. The paradigm logical form embedded in a good inference is\nmonotonic. New information is irrelevant to the validity of the\npattern itself, although it may well be relevant to a subject\u2019s\njustification for acceptance of the premises. Examples of inferences\nin classical texts often seem non-monotonic because fallibility\nattaches to the premises. Such fallibility of course passes to the\nconclusion, too. (Cf. Israel 1980 who similarly voices an\nepistemological complaint against the very idea of\nnon-monotonic logic, according to Koons 2013.)\n\n\nTargeting the relationship of pervasion in Uddyotakara\u2019s second\ncondition, vy\u0101pti-smara\u1e47a, which\nappears to be the ontological underpinning of Dign\u0101ga\u2019s conditions\n(2) and (3), Dharmak\u012brti divides inferences into three\nkinds:\n\nsva-bh\u0101va (self-nature: \u201cIt\u2019s a tree because it\u2019s a\n\u015bi\u1e43\u015bap\u0101 oak\u201d)\ntad-utpatti (causality: \u201cFire is there because\nsmoke is there\u201d)\nanupalabdhi (non-perception: \u201cThere is no pot\nhere because none is perceived\u201d).\n\n\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra holds that with the first type of inference the\nunderpinning pervasion is \u201cinternal\u201d (antar-vy\u0101pti). We\nmay think of this as an internal relation between concepts and thus as\nsimilar to the a priori of Western philosophy. But it is\nactually a technical point about whether the term that picks out the\ninferential subject or subjects\u2014think of the\npak\u1e63a as a set\u2014closes it off from being\nincluded in the inductive base of the generalization (or extrapolation,\naccording to Ganeri 2001b) that gives us knowledge of a pervasion\nrelationship. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and\nNy\u0101ya rule out this kind of inference as begging the question: we\nwant to know whether the inferential subject possesses the probandum\nproperty and so to cite that subject itself, even a part of it, runs\ncounter to the very purpose of inference.\n\nLater Ny\u0101ya divides inferences not according to the ontology of\npervasion (which is mapped onto the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika ontology and\ncausal theory, sometimes not very successfully) but rather by the way a\npervasion is known:\n\nanvaya-vyatireka (\u201cpositive and negative\u201d): inferences\nbased on positive and negative correlations where both are available,\ni.e., cases where, for example, smokiness and fieriness have been known\nto occur together, kitchen hearths, campfires, etc., like (it is\nclaimed) yonder smoky mountain where being-fiery is to be proved, taken\nalong with negative examples where the prover as well as\nthe probandum is known not to occur\nkevala-anvaya (\u201cpositive only\u201d): inferences based on\npositive correlations only, where there are no known examples of an\nabsence of the probandum property, such as would have to be the case\nwith the universally present property, knowability (there is nothing\nthat is not knowable)\nkevala-vyatireka (\u201cnegative only\u201d): inferences based on\nnegative correlations only where outside of the inferential subject there\nare no known cases of the probandum.\n\nMany of the inferences that Buddhists identify as hinging on an\n\u201cinternal pervasion\u201d (antar-vy\u0101pti)\nNy\u0101ya philosophers see as \u201cnegative only\u201d\n(kevala-vyatireka). Taking a\nparticular \u015bi\u1e43\u015bap\u0101 oak as\nthe pak\u1e63a, we have the negative correlation proving it\nis a tree: whatever is not a tree, is not a\n\u015bi\u1e43\u015bap\u0101\noak, for example, a lotus.\n\nWestern interpretations and representations of inference as classically\nconceived have often missed its unity as a knowledge source. Ganeri\n(2001b: 20) claims that it is better to understand both the Buddhist and\nearly Ny\u0101ya patterns as \u201cnot enthymematic,\u201d not skipping a step of\ngeneralization and then implicitly using universal instantiation (UI)\nand modus ponens (MP) in applying the rule to a case at hand.\nCase-based reasoning need not be interpreted as relying on universal\nquantifiers, and the representation of Schayer (1933) and others which\nuses them is misleading. Theirs is indeed misleading, and Ganeri\nappears to be right with regard to the early theories. But with late\nNy\u0101ya Schayer\u2019s argument form of UI and MP misleads for yet\nanother reason, namely, failing to be sufficiently sensitive to the\nlogic of occurrence and non-occurrence of properties at a location, or\nqualifying a property-bearer, as Staal (1973) and others have brought\nout. Furthermore, Ganeri is right that in analyzing the pattern one\ntends to miss the unity of the causal theory that has one mental state\nbrought about by another. In the Ny\u0101ya theory, everything is\nintegrated in the notion of \u201creflection,\u201d\npar\u0101mar\u015ba, as an inference\u2019s proximate\ninstrumental cause or \u201ctrigger,\u201d kara\u1e47a.\nWhile not the only necessary condition, this one is the last in place,\nsecuring the occurrence of inferential knowledge.\n\nFollowing Matilal (1998), we can reconstruct such \u201creflection\u201d as a\nsingular inference:\n\n\n(K)(SpHa) \u2192 (K)Sa\n\n\nThis says that on the condition that a subject knows that\nH-as-qualified-by-being-pervaded-by-S\nqualifies a, then the subject knows that Sa. The arrow\nshould be interpreted as depicting causal sufficiency, in line with\nUddyotakara and the later tradition.  \u201cReflection\u201d is a\ncomplex mental state that is nevertheless a unity, both as a\nparticular cognition that can be a causal factor for the rise of\nanother cognition and as having intentionality, or \u201cobjecthood,\u201d\nexpressible in a single sentence. Attempts to find a single rule are\nin consonance with both of these dimensions of the theory. But a lot\nof inductive depth is packed into the idea of a pervasion being known,\nand a lot about it is said that shows that there is generalization, at\nleast in the later Ny\u0101ya theory. Knowing a general rule is\nconsidered crucial, not just extrapolation to a next case. From\nUddyotakara on, Ny\u0101ya philosophers treat pervasion as the\nequivalent of a rule stating that\u2014to use the language of sets\nand terms\u2014the extension of the probandum term includes that of\nthe prover term, includes it entirely such that there is nothing that\nlocates the pervaded property (the prover) that does not also locate\nthe pervader (the probandum), as argued by Kisor Chakrabarti (1995)\namong others.\n\n The centralmost issue with inference, to consider the effort of\nlate Ny\u0101ya philosophers, is to make plain the logic of pervasion\nas well as how we know the universalized items, or entire extensions,\nof the terms figuring in our knowledge of such rules, the items that\nunderpin our knowledge of such inclusions, such naturally necessary\npervasions of a prover by a probandum property. Lots of work from the\nearliest focuses on fallacies and inference in the context of formal\ndebate. And there are many philosophical inferences advanced in the\nliteratures of the various schools, such as proofs of momentariness,\nthe existence of God, the possibility of liberation from birth and\nrebirth, and dozens more.\n6. Testimony\n\n\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika among the Vedic schools\nalong with Buddhists who of course impugn the \u201ctestimony\u201d of the Veda\nreject testimony as an independent knowledge source,\npram\u0101\u1e47a. Buddhists claim that their\nreligious teachings are founded on nothing other than reasoning and\nexperience, albeit mystical experience, the\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a experience that makes a\nBuddha an expert about spiritual matters. As with memory, whose\ncorrectness is dependent on the veridicality or non-veridicality of the\ncognition that forms the sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra\nmemory-impression, the veridicality of testimony depends on the\nknowledge of the testifier, the speaker, whose source has to be bona fide, namely,\ndepending on the epistemological theory,\nperception or inference or perhaps testimony in a series where an original testifier \nwould know by means of a source other than testimony . Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nand Yog\u0101c\u0101ra join together in seeing a hearer H\u2019s knowledge\nthat p which other philosophers see as flowing from testimony\nas really resulting from an inference having as one premise that the\nspeaker S is trustworthy and as another that S has said p, assuming\nthat trustworthy people who know the truth communicate it faithfully, to\nconclude that p is true. Ny\u0101ya resists such as\ninferentialist account from the earliest, in the s\u016btras of\nGautama, claiming that the inferentialist conflates inferential\ncertification of the truth of p with testimonial knowledge\nthat p at a first or unreflective level (as nicely explained\nby Mohanty 1994). V\u0101tsy\u0101yana and others argue (under\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 2.1.52) that the certification\nconditions are different for the two knowledge sources. The\neighth-century Jayanta Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\nwrites (Ny\u0101ya-ma\u00f1jar\u012b 322):\n\u201cThe conditions that determine inferential knowledge and those that\ndetermine verbal knowledge are not the same.\u201d The Ny\u0101ya position\nis that comprehension and acceptance are normally fused such that\n(normally) we do get knowledge immediately (non-inferentially) from\nbeing told. Here they join\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, though there is also\nmuch controversy on this matter between the two schools.\n\nGautama provides a definition at Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra\n1.1.7: \u201cTestimony is the (true) statement of an expert\n(\u0101pta).\u201d An \u201cexpert,\u201d \u0101pta, is a\ntrustworthy authority such that \u201cexpert\u201d is not entirely adequate as a\ntranslation. V\u0101tsy\u0101yana in defining the term outlines a moral\ndimension. An \u0101pta is a person who not only knows the\ntruth but who wants to communicate it without deception\n(V\u0101tsy\u0101yana\u2019s commentary under\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.7). The commentator also\nbrings out a certain egalitarianism in the workings of the knowledge\nsource. Contra the privilege afforded the priestly caste in matters of\nVedic interpretation, he says that even foreigners\u2014\u201cbarbarians,\u201d\nmleccha\u2014can be the experts whose statements convey to us\ntestimonial knowledge, provided, as always, they know the truth and\nwant to communicate without deception.\n\nAccording to those who accept testimony as a genuine knowledge source, the process of generating testimonial knowledge begins with a speaker S\nwho knows a proposition p by perception, inference, or\ntestimony (chains of testimony are okay) and who has a desire to\ncommunicate p to someone or other. A hearer H gains knowledge\nthrough a speech act of S communicating p to H, who has to be\ncompetent in the language in which p is expressed, to know the\nwords and grammatical forms, which H has learned, on most accounts,\nalso chiefly through testimony but also in other ways such as analogy\n(according to some).\n\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, whose leaders Kum\u0101rila and\nPrabh\u0101kara are followed by many Ved\u0101ntins and by some\nNy\u0101ya philosophers, comes to the debate about testimony with an\naxe to grind, namely, to defend Vedic authority. The words of the Veda\nare not spoken by anyone originally. Speakers are subject to error but\nnot the Veda, whose verses are not originally composed\n(apauru\u1e63eya). Ved\u0101ntic theists, in the main, along\nwith almost all Ny\u0101ya philosophers, take the position that like\nall sentences, those of the Veda should be understood as spoken (or\ncomposed, etc.) by someone with the intention to communicate. Thus\nthe Lord, \u012b\u015bvara, is the author of the Veda (the best or\nonly candidate, according to Udayana, eleventh century,\nNy\u0101ya-kusum\u0101\u00f1jal\u012b).\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, however, is atheistic, viewing the Veda\nas primordial, resounding in the ether that surrounds the universe,\nheard and memorized by great rishis in\ntheir pellucid consciousness (not cluttered by ordinary thought). Thus\naccording to M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, sentences can be meaningful\nwithout having a speaker with an intention to communicate.\nVed\u0101ntin and Ny\u0101ya theists generalize from the everyday to\nassume that, no, statements and sentences require a speaker, a\ncomposer, who, in the case of S\u2019s knowledge passing to H, must be an\n\u0101pta expert, i.e., someone who knows the truth and wants\nto tell it without a desire to deceive. The Lord is this speaker in the\ncase of the Veda, it is inferred by some.\n\nThe Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara takes the view that everyday testimonial\nknowledge wears, like all knowledge, its truth on its sleeve; similarly\nVedic knowledge. Speaker\u2019s intention is irrelevant. A parrot can make\nus know something like a tape-recorder. And even a liar (S) deceived\ninto believing p can communicate \u00acp trying\nto deceive H who nevertheless learns the truth through S\u2019s statement.\nNy\u0101ya, in contrast, champions speaker\u2019s intention,\nt\u0101tparya, as epistemically relevant. According to the\nlater writers, speaker\u2019s intention is not the trigger of testimonial\nknowledge on H\u2019s part (which is instead the transmitting sentence under\nthe interpretation of H), but is a slightly upstream causal factor\nrelevant for certification. If we knew it were a parrot or a liar who\nwas responsible for the statement, we would no longer believe. It is\ntrue that H has to understand something in the case of the parrot, etc.\nOtherwise, there would be nothing to check in finding out that the\nparrot\u2019s speaking is a case of \u201capparent testimony,\u201d\n\u015babda-\u0101bh\u0101sa (e.g.,\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba,\nTattva-cint\u0101-ma\u1e47i, testimony\nchapter, 329). But discerning speaker\u2019s intention is championed as\nnecessary for disambiguation in some cases of testimony and as relevant\nto triggering figurative speech according to many including writers in\nthe aesthetics literature called\nala\u1e45k\u0101ra-\u015b\u0101stra.\n\nTestimonial knowledge is a matter of comprehending a statement, a\ntransmitting sentence, and to be a transmitting sentence certain\nconditions must be met. The following three necessary conditions for a\nmeaningful statement are proposed and discussed throughout the\nphilosophical and grammatical literatures (Kunjunni Raja 1969:\n149\u2013169).\n\n\nwords\u2019 mutual \u201cexpectancy,\u201d\n\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101\nsemantic \u201cfittingness,\u201d yogyat\u0101\ncontiguity (or proper presentation, pronunciation and the like),\n\u0101satti\n\n\nThe words in a sentence have their \u201cexpectancy\u201d mutually\nsatisfied in the completion of the sentence as a string of words. This\nand the third condition are pretty obviously required for sentential\nmeaning, but not the second, at least not to philosophers of language\nin the West, although the notion seems related to the a priori\nas understood in early modern philosophy. In any case, semantic\n\u201cfittingness\u201d is connected to a theory of figurative meaning throughout\nthe schools including the aesthetics literature. A stock negative\nexample is \u201cThe gardener is watering the plants with fire\u201d\n(agnin\u0101 si\u00f1cati). Watering cannot be done\nwith fire, and so the meanings of the words do not fit together except\npossibly figuratively. Some define yogyat\u0101 in a positive\nfashion, but it seems easy to find counterexamples (Kunjunni Raja 1969:\n164\u2013166). Language has to be flexible so that we can report novelties.\nFurthermore, we understand something when we understand a false\nstatement. Otherwise, again, we would not know where to look to\ndetermine its falsity, or truth, for that matter.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba says explicitly that false\nstatements as well as statements of doubt meet the requirement of\nsemantic fittingness\n(Tattva-cint\u0101-ma\u1e47i,\ntestimony chapter, 372\u2013373). Even statements that are not just false\nbut that we know are false can pass the semantic-fittingness test, as,\nfor example, (in the quip by A. Chakrabarti 1994) the views of one\u2019s\nopponents! For these and other reasons,\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, for one, defines\nyogyat\u0101 negatively as \u201cabsence of knowledge of a blocker\n(of testimonial knowledge)\u201d\n(Tattva-cint\u0101-ma\u1e47i,\ntestimony chapter, Sanskrit, IV.iii.6, p. 136). This shows a coherence\ntie. We cannot even understand testimony way out of whack with what we\nknow already.\n\nTwo M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 views compete to explain sentential\nunity, along with a third, a sentence holism belonging to the\ngrammarian Bhart\u1e5bhari (third century), who holds that words have\nno meaning outside the context of the sentence, which is the basic\nsemantic unit. Words are abstractions from sentences, and a sentence\nis understood holistically \u201cin a flash\u201d\n(spho\u1e6da; Bhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s theory is\ncalled spho\u1e6da-v\u0101da). This is an easy target for\nthe M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101kas, who point to our abilities to use\nthe same words in different sentences. But the one camp, the\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara, agrees with the grammarian that words do not\nconvey meaning apart from the full sentence being understood, that is\nto say, apart from the full fact indicated being known \u201cin a\nflash,\u201d as it were. The other camp, the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da,\nwhose theory comes to be taken over by Ny\u0101ya, claims that\nindividual words have reference in isolation, and that in\nunderstanding a sentence we understand the meaning of the individual\nsemantic units which get combined not so much by the sentence as by\nthe fact that makes a true sentence true, the relation holding the\nfact together becoming reflected in the unity of the sentence, so that\neach word\u2019s meaning or referent is hooked up with every other. These\ntwo views are termed in\nSanskrit anvita-abhidh\u0101na-v\u0101da, \u201creference of\nthe connected,\u201d which Siderits (1991) translates as the\n\u201crelated designation view,\u201d\nand abhihita-anvaya-v\u0101da, \u201cconnection of the\nreferents,\u201d which Siderits translates as the\n\u201cwords-plus-relation view.\u201d However, the latter might not\nbe the best rendering, since its advocates argue that the relation is\nnothing other than the individual denotees as related.\n\nIn other words, according to the more radically referentialist view,\nwhich is incrementalist, the relation is not just an additional\nelement: it\u2019s not words-plus-relation. No word is\n\u201cunsaturated\u201d; \u2018bringing\u2019 for example,\nrequires that its referent be related to both an agent and an object\nand no reference to bringing would generate a bit of new testimonial\nknowledge if these were not also mentioned or the ideas of them\nsupplied. There are only a few purely logical and syntactically\nbinding words in Sanskrit, only a few (mainly connectives) that are\njust syncategorematic, since every other word is inflected and there\nis no need for prepositions, etc. Alternatively, we could say that\nevery word is unsaturated because no word, no single semantic unit,\nconveys the meaning of a sentence by itself alone independently of its\nrelation to at least one other unit. The main difference between the\ntwo M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 views is that the former insists that\nonly a sentence successfully refers, not the individual words of which\na sentence is composed, whose meanings have to be connected to one\nanother in order for there to be reference (abhidh\u0101, the\nprimary mode or power,\n\u015bakti, of language); whereas the latter holds\nthat words do have reference individually but not to the connection of\nthe things mentioned, which is given by the sentence as a whole. In\nboth cases, the fact or object known by way of a sentence has\nconstituents. On the second view, the fact is the relatedness of the\nwords\u2019 referents as they are in the world, a relatedness\n(anvaya) not indicated by a semantic unit. The connection is\nto one another of the things referred to, a connection in the world\nwhich we become aware of because of the order and connectedness\n(anvaya) of the words. Gopinath Bhattacharya writes apropos\n(seventeenth-century) Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2019s\ndiscussion of the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da\ntheory (Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da: 301\u2013302): \u201cIt\ncomes to this then that the understanding of a statement, i.e., of what\nis signified by the constituent terms in relation to one another,\ndepends among other things on the presentation of the terms in the\nrequired order. But the order of arrangement of the terms is not\nitself a term of the sentence, so that it cannot be said that this\norder has its own \u015bakti like the terms.\u201d\n\nJust what a word refers to is sometimes ambiguous not just apart from\nsentential context but within it. Still we know what the word means. We\nknow that a speaker wants salt when S asks for it even though in\nSanskrit the word used for salt, \u2018saindhava\u2019, is a homonym\nwith a word that means horse. S\u2019s intention to communicate p\nis in such a case crucial to disambiguation in that S speaks in a\ncontext (prakara\u1e47a). Ordinarily, the\noverall context need not be taken into account, according to New\nNy\u0101ya philosophers, to ascertain the meaning of a sentence, which\nhas to meet only the three conditions of grammaticality, semantic\nfittingness, and proper pronunciation. But we do have to take into\naccount the overall context\u2014let us say \u201cspeaker\u2019s intention,\u201d\nt\u0101tparya\u2014it is stressed (e.g., by\nAnnambha\u1e6d\u1e6da: 294\u2013295), in some\ncases of ambiguity as also of figurative speech, which involves a\nsecond power of words, the power (\u015bakti) to\nexpress meaning indirectly.\n\nHowever, we have to be able to understand a spoken sentence to be able\nto determine a speaker\u2019s intention, which we infer from what is said\nsupplemented sometimes by contextual cues. Thus knowing the intention\nis not an invariable antecedent of testimonial knowledge. Understanding\nS\u2019s intention is not a fourth condition on a statement\u2019s meaningfulness\nfrom the perspective of H\u2014except in some cases of ambiguity and\nindirect, figurative speech. But in those cases it is indeed crucial,\nand there is no way to get around the need to make it out in order to\nfix the meaning, which cannot be gathered at, so to say, a first pass.\n\nBut on a second pass, we are able to gather not only indirect,\nsecondary meaning but also more information through inference. In this\nway, Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da would explain what\nothers see as the results of the activation of a third power of words,\nnamely, dhvani, also called vya\u00f1jana,\n\u201csuggestion\u201d (289\u2013293). In other words, if a sentence contains an\nambiguous word or indirect, figurative meaning (admitted as a bona\nfide second power of words, \u015bakti), there\nmay well be no way to tell what it means without considering S\u2019s\nintention. Now advocates of the third power analyze the stock example\nof indirect speech where a village is said to be in the\nGa\u1e45g\u0101 as suggesting that the village is cool\nand purified by association with the Ga\u1e45g\u0101.\nThe whole point, they argue, of poetic use of indirect, figurative\nspeech is to release the third power of suggestion. Why otherwise not\nsimply say that the village is on the river bank? The speaker uses the\nfigurative speech to suggest the attributes of coolness and\npurification. Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da responds\nthat if one understands from the statement these attributes then the\nindirect, figurative meaning\n(lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101) of \u201cin\nthe Ga\u1e45g\u0101\u201d is not just being on the bank of\nthe river but on a bank that lends coolness and fosters purification.\nThis is then just a more complex case of\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101,\nwhich is indeed a second power of words (but there is no third),\nindicating a cool and purifying location on the indicated bank.\n\nFinally we might mention that with veridical testimonial knowledge not\ninvolving figurative meaning where all three sentential conditions are\nmet, we do not notice the grammaticality, etc., of the transmitting\nsentence or sentences. These factors have to be present, but we do not\nhave to be aware of them. For figurative meaning, in contrast, we have\nto notice a blocker (Uddyotakara under\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 2.2.59), which paradigmatically\nmay be thought of as a violation of semantic fittingness (Kunjunni Raja\n1969: 166), though this is not precisely correct according to several\ntheorists who provide examples of figures where semantic fittingness is\nnot violated. Examples of less severe misfit occur than to water with\nfire. Violating yogyat\u0101 is not the only way to trigger\nthe second power of words. Yet further exploration of figurative\nmeaning and of \u201csuggestion\u201d (dhvani) would carry us outside of\nthe epistemological into the aesthetics and grammatical\nliteratures.\n7. Analogy and Other Candidate Sources\n7.1 Analogy and Similarity\n\n\nBriefly we may consider the more exotic candidate sources proposed\nin the classical literature mainly within\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (often elaborated by\nVed\u0101ntins), beginning with analogy, which is viewed as the\npram\u0101\u1e47a for knowledge of similarity\nin M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Ved\u0101nta\nbut is rejected by the other schools, Vedic and non-Vedic alike, except\nfor Ny\u0101ya which however provides a radical reinterpretation. To\nprovide a hermeneutics of Vedic injunctions to make them suitable for\npractice in actual performances, the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 exegetes need to be\nable to designate substitutes, of one type of grain for another, for\nexample, or one animal for another, depending upon availability in the\nfirst place but upon similarity in the second place. In Ved\u0101nta,\nanalogy is useful for understanding the Upanishads which make\ncomparisons between spiritual or yogic experience and the experiences\nof ordinary humans, as pointed out by Kumar (1980: 110).\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra, Jaina, and Ny\u0101ya logicians find similarity\u2014or\nrelevant similarity\u2014to figure in inference as a knowledge-generating\nprocess. It is through cognizing similarity and dissimilarity that we\narrive at knowledge of pervasion as required for inferential knowledge.\nA kitchen hearth counts as an \u201cexample\u201d in the stock inference because\nof its relevant similarity to the mountain which is the center of\ninquiry. It is part of what is called the\nsapak\u1e63a, the set of positive correlations,\nthat make us know an inference-underpinning pervasion. Knowledge of\nsimilarity is not viewed in Ny\u0101ya (or Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, etc.) as\nthe result of analogy as a knowledge source\u2014for Ny\u0101ya, analogy is\nrestricted to a subject\u2019s learning the meaning of a word (and\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra does not countenance it as a separate\npram\u0101\u1e47a). But pervasion is known\ntypically through generalization from cases (although in some cases a single observation, some\nsay, will suffice), presupposing\nknowledge of relevant similarity which can be a matter of\nperception.\n\nVed\u0101nta and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nphilosophers, who take similarity to be a special object known through\nthis special source, give examples different from the stock scenario\nprovided by Gautama and elaborated by V\u0101tsy\u0101yana (under\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.8) who limit the scope of\nanalogy to learning the meaning of a word. But for brevity\u2019s sake, let us\ntake up only the Ny\u0101ya theory. A subject S inquires of a forester\nabout a gavaya, which is a kind of buffalo, having heard the\nword \u2018gavaya\u2019 used among his schoolmates but not knowing what\nit means, i.e., not knowing what a gavaya is. Questioned by S,\nthe forester replies that a gavaya is like a cow mentioning\ncertain specifics as also some dissimilarities. To simplify, Ny\u0101ya\nphilosophers say that the forester makes an analogical statement (\u201cA\ngavaya is like a cow\u201d), whereby our subject S now knows in\ngeneral (s\u0101m\u0101nyata\u1e25) what the\nword means, according to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba and\nfollowers (Tattva-cint\u0101-ma\u1e47i,\nanalogy chapter). But S does not yet know how it is used, does not know\nits reference, which is deemed a word\u2019s primary meaning. Later\nencountering a gavaya buffalo, S says, \u201cThis, which is similar\nto a cow, is the meaning of the word \u2018gavaya\u2019,\u201d a statement\nwhich expresses S\u2019s new analogical knowledge. The knowledge has been\ngenerated by analogy, its \u201cknowledge source,\u201d\npram\u0101\u1e47a.\n\nThe ontology of similarity is controversial. Several different theories\nare proposed, one of the best of which belongs to\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, who sees it as a relational\nproperty supervening on other properties and defined as something\u2019s\nhaving a lot of the same properties as something else. It is not a\nuniversal, he argues, for similarity relates a correlate (the\ngavaya buffalo) and a countercorrelate (the cow), whereas a\nuniversal, in contrast, rests as a unity in, for example, with cowhood,\nall individual cows. In this way it is like contact, samyoga,\nbut there are also rather obvious differences. It is not reducible to\nany single category among the traditional seven (substance, quality,\nmotion, universal, individualizer, inherence, and absence), for some\nsubstances are like one another as are certain qualities and actions.\nBut similarity also is not, pace the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara, a\ncategory over and above the recognized seven.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s main argument there is\nthat similarity is not uniform. It is to an extent a property that is\nmind-imposed in that the counterpositive (the cow) is supplied from our\nside. Moreover, it supervenes on other properties.\n7.2 \u201cPresumption\u201d (arth\u0101patti)\n\n\nAnother candidate source championed by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nand Ved\u0101nta philosophers but rejected by everyone else as an\nindependent pram\u0101\u1e47a is arth\u0101patti, a\nkind of reasoning to the best explanation which Ny\u0101ya views as\nthe same as \u201cnegative-only\u201d inference (see above). A stock\nexample: from the premise, \u201cFat Devadatta does not eat during\nthe day\u201d (known by perception and/or testimony), the conclusion\nis known (by arth\u0101patti), \u201cHe eats at\nnight.\u201d For Ny\u0101ya, the inference (which is no special\nsource) can be reconstructed where F = \u201cis fat but does not eat\nduring the day\u201d and G = \u201ceats at night\u201d: Whoso F,\nthat person G; what is not so (F) is not so (G), like Maitra (who eats\nduring the day and not at night). This would be a\n\u201cnegative-only\u201d inference so long as not only has\nDevadatta not been observed to eat at night but also there is no one\nelse known to be like him in being fat and having been observed to eat\nonly at night. We do know that he eats at night (though this has not\nbeen observed), and our inductive base is comprised only of negative\ncorrelations. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 rejects this analysis and\nholds in contrast that presumption is an independent\nknowledge source and an important one, operative in basic language\ncomprehension as well as in knowledge of various everyday facts. The\nreasoning is not inferential because no pervasion is known, it is\ncommonly argued.\n7.3 \u201cNon-cognition\u201d (anupalabdhi)\n\n\nHow do we know absences? I know that my glasses are not on the table\nbut how? Dharmak\u012brti would answer, \u201cBy inference,\u201d\ninferential knowledge of an absence being one of three fundamental\ntypes identified by the Yog\u0101c\u0101rin (see above). \u201cIf an\nelephant were in the room, I (S) would perceive it. I (S) do not\nperceive an elephant. Therefore, there is no elephant in the\nroom\u201d\u2014similarly for my glasses not being on the table (presuming the\ntable is not so cluttered that they could be concealed). Gautama and\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana, without elaborating, agree that absences are\nknown inferentially (Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra 2.2.2). But\nUddyotakara and the later tradition argue that we know absences\nsometimes perceptually. I cognize immediately my glasses\u2019 absence when\nI look for them on the table.\n\nBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 says no, there is\noperative here a special knowledge source called \u201cnon-cognition\u201d or\n\u201cnon-perception,\u201d anupalabdhi. The main arguments center on\nthe sufficiency of perception, or inference, to make known such\nnegative facts, which clearly we do know. The\nBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da argues, for example,\nthat perception makes known only presences. Indeed, Ny\u0101ya has a\ndifficult time assimilating such knowledge to its theory of perception,\nin particular since the difficulty widens into what is known in\nanalytic philosophy as the generality problem. Ny\u0101ya recognizes\nthat an absence has a peculiar relational structure, namely, to relate\na locus (the table) to a counterpositive (my glasses) and that the idea of the counterpositive\nis furnished by the cognizer entirely from memory. If memory can have such a\ncrucial role in a type of perception, how then to draw the limits on\nwhat is perceptible? The Ny\u0101ya project threatens to spin out of\ncontrol. Not surprisingly, therefore, there is a large literature on\nabsence and its epistemology.\n7.4 Gesture and Rumor\nWe learn some things from gesture\n(ce\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101), such as to\ncome when beckoned by a conventionalized movement of the hand.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba says this is an aid to\ntestimonial knowledge, not really a form of it since it depends on other\nsemanitc items, he says, being supplied \n(Tattva-cint\u0101-ma\u1e47i, testimony\nchapter, 922\u2013926). Rumor (aitihya) is defined by\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana (under Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra\n2.2.1) as a testimony chain whose originator is unknown. The Ny\u0101ya\nattitude is to regard even it as presumptively veridical in consonance\nwith the school\u2019s overall theory of testimony.\n8. \u201cSuppositional Reasoning\u201d (tarka)\n\nMany classical Indian philosophers held that apparent certification\nmay not be enough to warrant belief in some instances. Even if our\nbeliefs/cognitions have indeed been generated by processes that would\nbe counted knowledge sources did they not face counterconsiderations,\nin facing counterconsiderations\u2014in being reasonably\nchallenged\u2014they are not trustworthy and do not guide\nunhesitating effort and action.  There is a social dimension to\nknowledge, where reasoning reigns resolving controversy in ways over\nand above the sources. These are the ways of tarka,\n\u201chypothetical\u201d or \u201csuppositional reasoning.\u201d\nParadigmatically, tarka is called for in order to establish a\npresumption of truth in favor of one thesis that has putative source\nsupport against a rival thesis that also has putative source support,\na thesis and a counterthesis both backed up by, for example,\napparently genuine inferences (the most common situation) or by\ncompeting perceptual or testimonial evidence. By supposing the truth\nof the rival thesis and (in Socratic style) showing how it leads to\nunacceptable consequences or breaks another intellectual norm, one\nrepossesses a presumption of truth, provided\u2014the classical\nepistemologists never tire of emphasizing\u2014provided one\u2019s own\nthesis does indeed have at least the appearance of a knowledge source\nin its corner. The consensus across schools is that such arguments are\nnot in themselves knowledge-generators, but they can swing the balance\nconcerning what it is rational to believe.\n\nSuppositional reasoning is what a philosopher is good at, drawing out\nof implications of opposed views and testing them against mutually\naccepted positions, according to, broadly speaking, criteria of\ncoherence but also of simplicity. Here we come to the vital center of\nthe life of a classical philosopher, which is reflected in honorific\nappellations and book titles, dozens of which use \u2018tarka\u2019 as\nin \u201cCrest Jewel of Reasoning\u201d\n(tarka-\u015biro-ma\u1e47i).\n\nUdayana (Ny\u0101ya, eleventh century) appears to inherit a sixfold\ndivision of tarka according to the nature of the error in an\nopponent\u2019s position, and expressly lists five types (a sixth,\n\u201ccontradiction\u201d or \u201copposition,\u201d either being\nassumed as the most common variety, or subsumed under Udayana\u2019s fifth\ntype, \u201cunwanted consequence\u201d). Philosophers from other\nschools present distinct but overlapping lists. The Ny\u0101ya\ntextbook-writer, Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha, of the early seventeenth\ncentury, mentions ten, Udayana\u2019s five plus five more, many of which\nare used by the Advaitin \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a (probably\nUdayana\u2019s younger contemporary) among other reasoners. They are: (1)\nself-dependence (begging the question), (2) mutual dependence (mutual\npresupposition), (3) circularity (reasoning in a circle), (4) infinite\nregress, and (5) unwanted consequence (including contradiction\npresumably)\u2014Udayana\u2019s five\u2014plus (6) being presupposed by\nthe other, the first established (a form of \u201cfavorable\u201d\nsuppositional reasoning), (7) (hasty) generalization, (8)\ndifferentiation failure, (9) theoretic lightness, and (10) theoretic\nheaviness.\n\nIt is tarka that establishes a presumption against\nskepticism.  Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba (fourteenth century): \u201cWere a\nperson P, who has ascertained thoroughgoing positive\ncorrelations (F wherever G) and negative correlations\n(wherever no G, no F), to doubt that an effect might\narise without a cause, then\u2014to take up the example of smoke and\nfire\u2014why should P, as he does, resort to fire for smoke (in the\ncase, say, of a desire to get rid of mosquitoes)?  (Similarly) to food\nto allay hunger, and to speech to communicate to another\nperson?\u201d (Translation from Phillips 1995: 160\u2013161, slightly\nmodified.) The argument, which is found in the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra and other works (e.g.,\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana, preamble to\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.1), is that without the\nconfidence that presupposes knowledge, we would not act as we do.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriTex\">Primary Texts</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriTex\">Primary Texts</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da.\n<em>Tarka-sa\u1e43graha</em>, Tr.
