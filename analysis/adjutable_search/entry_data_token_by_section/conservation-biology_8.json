    "main_text": "What is Conservation Biology? || Conservation Biology and the Philosophy of Science\n2.4 Conservation Biology and the Philosophy of Science\n\nPhilosophers of science have thought of the core questions of the\ndiscipline as these. What is the structure of scientific theories?\nWhat is the logic of confirmation of theories by evidence? What is a\nscientific explanation? What is scientific objectivity and does the\npresence of values in science thwart that objectivity? With regard to\nthe Lande\u2019s metapopulation model and MacArthur and\nWilson\u2019s equilibrium model, we can ask the first three\nquestions. First, we can recognize that these are models that\nabstracted and idealized representations of objects like northern\nspotted owls and fauna on Mangrove islands in Florida. Likewise, we\ncan look at evidence that confirms and disconfirms them. Lande argues\nthat the assumption that northern spotted owls were at a demographic\nequilibrium was supported by the available evidence; Simberloff argued\nthat measures of species turnover rates disconfirmed the equilibrium\nmodel as applied to the fauna on the Mangrove islands. We can argue\nwhether there is sufficient evidence that the assumptions of the\nequilibrium model apply to mountain tops as opposed to islands. One\nmight also argue that the equilibrium model explains the species area\neffect. For those case studies the traditional questions are present\nand philosophical answers to them can be articulated. We can also ask\nwhether Lande\u2019s work was sufficiently objective given that he\ndid the analysis for \u201cpolitical\u201d purposes. However, when we consider SCP, things look very different. Consider place\nprioritization procedures and multi-criteria analysis. The former\nconsiders a set of cells, surrogates, and targets and tries to solve\nto find the smallest set of cells such that every surrogate is met at\ntheir target and find those places subject to a constraint for which\ncoverage exceeds the target. These are optimization problems to be\nsolved by an algorithm via a computer program. The latter considers a\nset of alternatives and using a suite of criteria representing our\nvalues, which determines a non-dominated set of alternatives to inform\ndesign of conservation networks. This brings tools from economics,\npolicymaking, and operations research to help identify solutions to\nproblems. In fact, much of the work that is done in systematic\nconservation planning is done using software packages like the\nfollowing:\n\n\n\nReserve design (Marxan, Zonation, TNC Sites)\n\n\nSpecies distribution modeling (Maxent, DesktopGARP, DIVA-GIS,\nopenModeller, BioMapper),\n\n\nConnectivity (Linkage Mapper, Corridor Designer, CircuitScape,\nConnectivity Analysis Toolkit, Conefor, UNICOR), \n\n\nThreat assessment (GeoCAT, Mirada),\n\n\nPopulation viability analysis (Vortex, BIOMOD, RAMAS),\n\n\nMulti-criteria analysis (EXPERTCHOICE, MultiCSync).\n\n\nThus, with regard to SCP, it would make little sense to ask are these\nprograms, their associated algorithms, and outputs \u201ctrue\u201d?\nAre they confirmed or disconfirmed? How and what do they potentially\nexplain? If we inspect the list of computer programs above, we\nsee many different things that include more than just biology (see\nentry on ecology). The tools include ones\ndrawn not just from the natural sciences, but the social sciences and\nhumanities as well. This raises the question to what extent is\nconservation biology biology? Should it simply be\nconservation science (Kareiva & Marvier 2011)?\n\n\nThere are two rival views as to what the central aims of science are.\nRealists contend it is truth and empiricists say it is empirical\nadequacy (see entry on\n scientific realism).\n Representing the realist\u2019s view, Bas van Fraassen writes,\n\n\nScience aims to give us, in its theories, a literally true story of\nwhat the world is like; and acceptance of a scientific theory involves\nthe belief that it is true. (Fraassen 1980: 8)\n\n\nHowever, van Fraassen is an empiricist (see entry on\n constructive empiricism).\n For the empiricist,\n\n\nScience aims to give us theories which are empirically adequate; and\nacceptance of a theory involves as belief only that it is empirically\nadequate. (Fraassen 1980: 12)\n\n\nIf SCP is science, then neither realism nor empiricism fit the main\naims of science as articulated by prominent philosophers of science.\nIf so much of conservation biology involves developing algorithms and\ncomputer programs and articulating various conventions, then truth and\nempirical adequacy are relevant for parts of the discipline but\nirrelevant for large swaths. Moreover, if theory structure and\nconfirmation are irrelevant to those swaths because they concern truth\nor empirical adequacy, then the topic of scientific explanation will\nbe irrelevant as well. Since there are few theories and models, then\nthe questions regarding Bayesian versus frequentist methods of\nscientific inference will find less purchase in conservation biology\npractice. Additionally, and maybe most important, socioeconomic values\nare inputs into conservation biology and it simply cannot be done\nwithout them. Or, if it is to be done, it will be the values of a\nsmall set of scientists thus privileging the wrong people (Guha 1998,\nMartin 2017). If SCP is central to conservation biology, much of\nphilosophy of science is irrelevant to conservation\nbiology. Conservation biology increasingly looks like a pragmatic or\ninstrumental endeavor. One possible response would be to develop a\npragmatist or instrumentalist philosophy of science which\nde-emphasizes truth and empirical adequacy (Dewey 1938; Laudan\n1978).\n\nLet\u2019s consider how one might develop a more pragmatic philosophy\nof science. Some philosophers distinguish between epistemic\nand non-epistemic values (Kuhn 1977; McMullin 1982; Longino\n1990, 1996; Lacey 1999; Laudan 2004; Douglas 2009, 2013; Steel\n2010). The former concern truth and related notions like justification\nand explanation whereas the latter concern topics like equality,\nprofit, health, safety, and the like. It can be very difficult to\nclearly distinguish between these two types of values and attempting\nto doing so can quickly take us into ethical and metaethical\nissues. Nevertheless, in the sciences, we have epistemic questions\nlike \u201cDo the theoretical terms of a model refer to existing\nentities?\u201d, \u201cIs this model approximately true or\nempirically accurate?\u201d, \u201cHow accurate are the predictions\nof this model?\u201d Likewise, we have non-epistemic questions like,\n\u201cIs it easy to use this model?\u201d, \u201cIs this hypothesis\naccurate enough for our present purposes?\u201d, \u201cCan this\ntheory provide results in a timely fashion?\u201d, \u201cIs the\nmodel relatively inexpensive to use?\u201d (Elliott and McKaughan,\n2014, 4\u20135). Thus, there seems to be both epistemic and\nnon-epistemic values in science even if the line between them is hard\nto draw. Additionally, we often evaluate our theories and models with\nnon-epistemic considerations As Ronald Giere has argued,\n\u201cScientists use models to represent aspects of the world for\nspecific purposes\u201d (Giere 2004, 742). These scientific\nrepresentations are used for a variety of purposes. These purposes are\nnot only epistemic; some are non-epistemic. Moreover, there are\ntradeoffs between epistemic and non-epistemic values or purposes. For\nexample, we can increase the predictive accuracy of a model by\nincreasing the number of adjustable parameters. However, this also\nincreases the amount of work needed to measure those parameters, and\nit might be too costly. As a result, some philosophers of science\nargue that non-epistemic values can have more importance than\nepistemic values when they promote the aims of scientific inquiry\n(Elliott McKaughan 2014; Hicks 2014; Intemann 2015).\n\n\nOne might object that the fundamental aims of science are epistemic\nrather than non-epistemic or that epistemic values should constrain\nnon-epistemic ones (Douglas 2009; Steel 2010, 2015; Steel and Whyte\n2012). Some still will push back. First, it is clear that practical\naims do outweigh epistemic aims at least\nsometimes. Idealizations that distort the truthfulness of models may\nbe justified by practical considerations such as greater computational\nefficiency or tractability. Second, insofar as non-epistemic values\noutweigh epistemic ones, this can be carefully reflected in\nscientists\u2019 attitudes towards their theories and models. For\nexample, instead of believing that a given model is true, they may\naccept it for predictions with regard to a given domain or for\npolicy-making in very specific scenarios. However, as Daniel Steel\nargues, if scientific inquiry does not prioritize epistemic values,\nthen it is subject to what he calls Ibsen predicaments (after\nHenrik Ibsen\u2019s An Enemy of the People). An Ibsen\npredicament occurs when (a) highly valued objectives of a community\nare linked to some activity, (b) this activity has seriously harmful\neffects, and (c) if those effects became widely known and acted upon,\nthe community would be threatened (Steel 2017, 51).\n\n\nIt appears then that there are epistemic and non-epistemic values in\nthe sciences. Whether the latter should take precedence over the\nformer is the subject of current philosophical\ndiscussions. Conservation biology might very well be such a science where\nnon-epistemic values should take precedence over epistemic\nones. Nevertheless, we are thus left with several questions. First,\nhow do we distinguish between epistemic and non-epistemic values in\nthe sciences? Second, if we can distinguish between them, are\nnon-epistemic values sometimes more important than epistemic ones?\nThird, if non-epistemic values are sometimes more important than\nepistemic ones, does this occur in conservation biology? Can these\nnon-epistemic values include moral and political\nvalues? It is to issues concerning these values that we now turn.\n",
