    "main_text": "Laws and Theories || Theories\n7.2 Theories\n\nHis non-propositional account of laws, Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 254, n. 2)\nnotes, renders theoretical laws twice removed from propositions:\n\n[Laws] are used in the same way in a theoretical system as in a\nprimary system; cause, too, if the theoretical system is temporal. Of\ncourse the theoretical system is all like a variable hypothetical in\nbeing there just to be deduced from; and a law in the theoretical\nsystem is at two removes of deduction.\n\n\nIn his paper \u201cTheories\u201d (1929a), written in the summer of\n1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii), Ramsey calls the observational language\n\u2018primary system\u2019. The non-observational (theoretical)\nlanguage is called \u2018secondary system\u2019 (see also\n \u00a72).\n The paper is thoroughly instrumentalistic, since the factual content\nof theories consists only of their primary implications. This is made\nclear in a comment on the paper, written in August 1929 ([NP] 229,\nfootnote removed; see also Ramsey (1931, [FM] 260):\n\n\nThe essence of a theory is that we make our assertions in a form\ncontaining a lot of parameters, which have to be eliminated in order\nto get our real meaning.\n\nWe mean to assert everything that can be deduced and does not contain\na parameter.\n\n\nThe \u201cparameters\u201d here are the secondary terms. And Ramsey\n([NP] 236) stresses in a note on the infinite in mathematics that\ntheir use does not entail any ontological commitment:\n\nIt is obvious that mathematics does not require the existence of an\ninfinite number of things. We say at once that imaginary things will\ndo, i.e. theoretical secondary terms. But there are no imaginary\nthings, they are just words, and mathematicians and physicists who use\nthe infinite are just manipulating symbols with some analogy to\npropositions.\n\n\nTo investigate the relation of the primary and the secondary system,\nRamsey (1929a, [FM] 215\u201319) provides a primary system for an\nagent who, in discrete time intervals, can move forwards and\nbackwards, open and close their eyes, and see blue, red, or nothing.\nIn the secondary system, Ramsey formulates a toy theory that describes\nthe movement of the agent among three locations and the sometimes\nchanging color of the locations. A dictionary defines the primary\nterms in the secondary system so that, for instance, the agent sees\nblue if and only if situated at a blue location with open eyes.\n\nRamsey (1929a, [FM] 217\u201319) shows that all the theory\u2019s\nimplications in the primary system can be listed without the use of\nthe secondary system and, contrary to \u201cRussell, Whitehead, Nicod\nand Carnap\u201d (220), that it is virtually impossible to define the\nsecondary terms in the primary system:\n\n[T]here is neither in this case nor in general any simple way of\ninverting the dictionary so as to get either a unique or an obviously\npreeminent solution which will also satisfy the axioms, the reason for\nthis lying partly in difficulties of detail in the solution of the\nequations, partly in the fact that the secondary system has a higher\nmultiplicity, i.e. more degrees of freedom, than the primary. (222)\n\n\nCarnap (1923, 100) had already noted the additional degrees of freedom\nin the secondary system, but without appreciating the implication\n(obvious for Ramsey) regarding the inversion of the dictionary.\nRamsey\u2019s qualification that there is no simple\ninversion is needed to exclude the following case: Assume that all the\nmodels of the theory and the dictionary are finite and all objects\nhave names in the primary system. Then in each model \\(M_i\\), each\nterm \\(T_j\\) of the secondary system is co-extensional with a formula\n\\(\\phi_{i,j}\\) in the primary system. If furthermore each model is\nnamed by a sentential constant \\(C_i\\) of the primary system, one can\ndefine each term \\(T_jx_1\\ldots x_n\\) as the conjunction of the\nmaterial implications \\(C_i \\to \\phi_{i,j}(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) for all\nmodels \\(M_i\\) (220\u201321). However, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 230)\nargues, apart from being cumbersome, definitions for secondary terms\nactually hinder scientific development because they require conceptual\ndecisions based on fiat rather than further empirical discoveries (cf.\nBraithwaite 1953, 52\u201376). This criticism was later rediscovered\nby Carnap (1936, 449).\n\nTo avoid these problems, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 231) suggests a way of\napplying a theory without defining the secondary terms:\n\nThe best way to write our theory seems to be this:\n\n\\((\\exists \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)\\): dictionary \\(\\cdot\\)\naxioms.\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are variables for the terms of\nthe secondary system and are interpreted purely extensionally, so that\nthe theory states \u201cThere are extensions \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\),\nand \\(\\gamma\\) that satisfy the sentences of the dictionary and the\naxioms\u201d. In contemporary presentations, the axioms are usually\ndenoted \\(T\\) (for \u2018theory\u2019), the dictionary is denoted\n\\(C\\) (for \u2018correspondence rules\u2019), and the secondary\nterms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are treated as parameters in \\(T\\) and\n\\(C\\), so that the conjunction of axioms and dictionary is written as\n\\(TC(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n)\\). What is now called the \u2018Ramsey\nsentence\u2019 \\({TC}^R\\) is then written as \n\\[ {TC}^R = \\exists X_1,\\ldots ,X_nTC(X_1,\\ldots ,X_n), \\]\n\n\nthat is, in the conjunction of all axioms and sentences of the\ndictionary, the theoretical terms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are replaced by\nvariables \\(X_1,\\ldots ,X_n\\) and bound by existential quantifiers.\nThis procedure is now known as \u2018Ramseyfication\u2019 or\n\u2018Ramsification\u2019. If some of the theoretical terms are of\nthe highest order (predicates or functions of \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\)\norder in \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) order logic), then Ramseyfication\nincreases the order of the theory by one. While higher-order\nexistential quantification was commonly used to express consistency\nwhen Ramsey wrote \u201cTheories\u201d, he was the first to quantify\non only some of the terms (Demopoulos 2003, 256). Crucially, the\nRamsey sentence contains no theoretical terms while still entailing\nthe same primary statements as \\(TC\\) (for a simple proof, see Bohnert\n1967, 342\u201343). Since all of \\(TC\\)\u2019s sentences are in the\nscope of the existential quantifiers introduced during Ramseyfication,\n\\({TC}^R\\) does not assign meaning to individual secondary sentences\nor terms. However, we can still reason with them by deriving primary\npropositions from them within the scope of the quantifiers, just as we\ncan derive propositions from variable hypotheses (1929a, [FM] 232;\nBohnert 1967, 344\u201347). Hence secondary universal sentences are\n\u201cat two removes\u201d from propositions, and secondary\nsentences and terms are only meaningful in the context of the theory\nto which they belong (1931, 260).\n\nAs an example, consider a simplification of Ramsey\u2019s toy theory\nthat states that being at a blue location with open eyes is followed\nby being at a red location with open eyes: \\(\\forall x(Bx \\wedge Ox\n\\to Rx' \\wedge Ox')\\), where \\(x'\\) is the successor of \\(x\\).\n\u2018Blue\u2019 (\\(B\\)), \u2018red\u2019 (\\(R\\)), and \u2018open\neyes\u2019 (\\(O\\)) are theoretical terms. The correspondence rules\ndefine the observational terms \u2018perceiving blue\u2019 as\n\u2018being at a blue location with open eyes\u2019, \\(\\forall x(Px\n\\leftrightarrow Bx \\wedge Ox)\\), and correspondingly \u2018perceiving\nred\u2019 \\(\\forall x(Qx \\leftrightarrow Rx \\wedge Ox)\\). The Ramsey\nsentence of \\(TC\\) is then: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\exists X_1,X_2,X_3[& \\forall x(Px \\leftrightarrow X_1x \\wedge X_2x) \\;\\wedge \\\\\n & \\forall x(Qx \\leftrightarrow X_3x \\wedge X_2x) \\;\\wedge \\\\\n & \\forall x(X_1x \\wedge X_2x \\to X_3x' \\wedge X_2x')] \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis is equivalent to the observational sentence \\(\\forall x(Px \\to\nQx')\\), which states that perceiving blue is followed by perceiving\nred. For any specific location \\(a\\), this variable hypothetical then\nbecomes the proposition \\(Pa \\to Qa'\\).\n\nWhile sentences of any order can be Ramseyfied, many technical\ndiscussions (e.g., the overview by van Benthem 1978) treat the special\ncase in which axioms and dictionary are of first order and the Ramsey\nsentence is of second order. In this case, the class of models of the\nobservational first-order implications of \\(TC\\) can be a proper\nsuperset of the class of models of \\({TC}^R\\). This has been known at\nleast since 1941 as the difference between elementary and\npseudoelementary classes (Hodges 1993, 207, 260) and is regularly\nrediscovered in philosophy (see Demopoulos 2011, 179). It entails that\n\\({TC}^R\\) can be false in a structure even though all the first order\nimplications of \\(TC\\) are true. Specifically, \\(TC\\) may only have\ntautological observational implications even though the Ramsey\nsentence is not logically true; this situation is one version of the\ndistinction between syntactic and semantic conservativeness known from\ndefinition theory (Gupta 2015, \u00a72.3; Prze\u0142\u0119cki 1969,\n52\u201353).\n\nCarnap (1963, \u00a724.D) used the Ramsey sentence for distinguishing\nbetween the analytic and synthetic components of higher-order theories\n(Uebel 2016, \u00a73.5), and Lewis (1970) significantly modified the\nRamsey sentence to arrive at explicit definitions of secondary terms\n(Andreas 2017, \u00a74.4). This Ramsey-Lewis sentence has become\ncentral in the philosophy of mind (Levin 2017, \u00a74.1) and\nphilosophical methodology (Papineau 2016, \u00a72.3).\n\nIn current terminology, the semantics of the Ramsey sentence is the\nfollowing: \\({TC}^R\\) is true in a structure \\(S\\) for the primary\nterms if and only if it is possible to add interpretations for the\nsecondary terms to \\(S\\) such that \\(TC\\) is true (Prze\u0142\u0119cki\n1969, ch. 6; Andreas 2017, \u00a74.2). Sneed (1971, 106) modified the\nsemantics of the Ramsey sentence for the use in structuralism (Schmidt\n2014, \u00a72.2.1; Stegm\u00fcller 1976, 88\u201389). Maxwell (1970,\n186\u201388) identified the Ramsey sentence with its semantics to\nargue that the Ramsey sentence expresses structural realism (see also\nLadyman 2016, \u00a73.2). Dewar (2019) argues that this is\nmisguided.\n",
