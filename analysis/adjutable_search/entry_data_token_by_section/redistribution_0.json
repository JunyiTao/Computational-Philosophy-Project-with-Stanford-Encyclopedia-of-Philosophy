Distributive Justice and Redistribution\n\n\nThe concept of distributive justice is sometimes understood as the\nmoral assessment of distributions, or as the moral assessment of\nindividual or collective decisions in light of how they affect\ndistributions. Since the publication of Rawls\u2019s \u201cTheory of\nJustice\u201d, however, discussions of distributive justice have\ntended to focus more narrowly on the moral assessment of systems of\nsocial rules in light of how they affect distributions. These\ndistributions affecting institutions include laws and other social\nrules governing what kinds of things can be owned (and by whom), how\nthey can be acquired, transferred, relinquished, and forfeited, how\nmarkets and the production systems are structured, the manner in which\ndecisions concerning trade policy and the monetary system are made,\nand so on. Because international institutions such as markets in\ncapital and labor, the structure of property rights, the international\ntrading regimes (including the World Trade Organization), the\ninternational financial institutions marked by the agreement of\nBretton Woods, and other complex systems of international rules can\nalso be assessed in terms of their effects on distributions, talk of\n\u2018international\u2019 or \u2018global\u2019 distributive\njustice has more recently become more prominent in political\ntheory (Beitz 1979, Caney 2005, Hinsch 2001, Miller 2007).\n\n\nThe concept of redistribution has been invoked extensively in\ndiscussions of distributive justice in both the domestic and global\ncontext. Indeed, the differences between popular recent approaches to\ndistributive justice, such as libertarianism, prioritarianism, and\nso-called luck egalitarianism, are sometimes characterized in terms of\ntheir attitudes towards redistribution (Scheffler 2003). Even when\nnon-philosophers debate the justice of distributions, or of\ndistribution affecting institutional arrangements, their discussions\noften take the form of questioning whether and under what circumstances\nthe \u2018redistribution\u2019 of wealth is justified. Extreme\npoverty in developed and developing countries, for example, has led\nmany to question whether affluent people or countries can and ought to\n\u2018help\u2019 or \u2018aid\u2019 the poor by redistributing\nresources to them, and whether they can be compelled by law to do so\n(for example, through the tax system) (Narveson 2002, 2003).\n\n\nGiven its robust role in discussions of distributive justice, it is\nunsurprising that disagreements concerning the permissibility of\nredistribution have often been quite heated. Robert Nozick (1974, p\n169) for example, has argued that redistribution in the form of\ncompulsory taxation is \u201cmorally on par with forced labor.\u201d\nAnd he has famously criticized egalitarian principles of distributive\njustice, such as Rawls\u2019s difference principle (which categorizes as\nunjust any national economic order generating inequalities that are\nnot to the greatest benefit of the lowest socio-economic position) on\nthe grounds that they would require extensive redistributive\ntransfers. In this vein, critics of so-called redistributive policies\noften claim that while individuals may have positive ethical\nduties to aid poor or unwell persons, it is morally impermissible to\ncompel them to do so through state-administered tax and transfer or\nother means, unless universal consent for these policies can be\nsecured (Narveson 2001, ch. 17).  Egalitarians, on the other hand,\nhave often argued that redistribution through compulsory taxation and\nother coercively imposed measures is required to meet basic material\nneeds or to promote other valuable social goals, and provide a\nlegitimate, though perhaps not morally costless means of doing so.\n\n\nThis essay aims to clarify and evaluate some of these disagreements\nby exploring the many different senses in which the concept of\nredistribution has been used. It also indicates some of the confusions\nto which equivocation among different senses of this concept has led.\nIt concludes that the use of the concept of redistribution has tended\nto obscure rather than clarify the true nature of substantive\ndisagreements about distributive justice.\n\n\nTwo kinds of questions concerning redistribution can be\nidentified:\n\nMeaning/Status: What does \u2018redistribution\u2019\nmean? Does it have a unified and coherent meaning? What kind\nof a term is \u2018redistribution\u2019: Is it purely descriptive, so\nthat we can classify practices as redistributive without evaluating \nthem? Or does the correct application of the term, like\ndemocracy, liberty, and perhaps also coercion depend on evaluative\n judgments?[1]\n To what kinds of social practices does redistribution refer, and in\nwhat sense are these practices redistributive? Does the concept of\nredistribution provide a helpful framework for understanding and\nevaluating institutional arrangements, or does it invite\nconfusion?\nMoral Significance: Can social practices that are commonly\nsaid to involve redistribution be justified? In what contexts and for\nwhat purposes is it permissible to adopt these practices? Does the fact\nthat a social practice involves redistribution count for or against it,\nor does it lack basic moral significance?\n\n\n\nWe might begin to address these questions by looking more closely at\nthe structure of the concept of redistribution.\n\n\nThe concept of redistribution can be characterized in terms of four\nparameters. (1) The subjects, such as individual persons or\nrigidly and non-rigidly defined groups whose holdings of goods are\nmodified through the redistribution; (2) The baseline, the\ninitial distribution of goods to which some other distribution is seen\nas a redistributive modification; (3) The social mechanism,\nsuch as a change in tax laws, monetary policies, or tort law, that\nengenders the redistribution of goods among these subjects; and (4)\nthe goods, such as income and property (or perhaps\nopportunities and liberties), that are redistributed through this\nmechanism.\n\n\nIn assessing whether and how redistribution has occurred, then, the\nfollowing four questions must be answered:\n\nAmong which (if any) subjects did the redistribution take\nplace?\nWhich (if any) baseline can be defined, of which the\npresent distribution can be seen as a modification?\nThrough which (if any) social mechanism was the\nredistribution brought about?\nWhich (if any) goods have been redistributed?\n\n\n\nRedistribution refers to modifications of the holdings of particular\npersons, collective agents, or groups (as defined in terms of\nnon-resource holding characteristics), or changes in holdings by groups\n(as defined by resource holdings). Sometimes those from and to whom\nresources are redistributed are defined as individuals, other times as\ngroups to which individuals are rigidly assigned (for example, Whites\nand Hispanics), and other times to groups that are defined by their\nholdings (for example, the top and bottom quintile). We can identify\npatterns in terms of rigidly identifiable persons (John and Sally) or\ngroups (Whites and Hispanics) or, alternatively,\n\u2018anonymously\u2019 (for example, as a percentile graph or Lorenz\ncurve). We can imagine a scenario in which, pursuant to some\ninstitutional reform, the average holdings of the richest quintile and\nthe poorest quintile shift from <5,3> at time\nt1 to <6,2> at time t2,\nwhile the average holdings of Whites and Hispanics or the actual\nholdings of John and Sally remain unchanged. Whether redistribution has\noccurred, then, can only be determined relative to the set of\nsubjects that is identified.\n\n\nDiscussions of redistribution are not always very specific about which\nkinds of subjects they are concerned with, or about the possible\nsignificance of the fact that policies will be more or less\nredistributive depending on how these subjects are defined. Take, for\nexample, the following claim by Harvard economist Richard\nFreeman (1999, p. 12), who claims that a set of policies he proposes\nwill result in \u201csubstantial income redistribution from those who\nhave gained so much in the past 15 to 20 years\u2026for it results\nin improving the living standards of those now at or near the\nbottom.\u201d The referent of \u2018those\u2019, in both the first\nand second clauses, could be understood as picking out groups of\nspecific individuals (a set of proper names), or group statistical\naggregates (the top or bottom quintile). If the claim refers to groups\nof particular individuals, then lack of change in the pattern of\nholdings between the top and bottom income quintiles needn\u2019t mean that\nno redistribution has taken place. If substantial numbers of people\nhave moved up or down, then redistribution (in this sense) has taken\nplace. My focus in this entry will be on the issue of the baseline,\nsince this seems most fundamental.\n",
