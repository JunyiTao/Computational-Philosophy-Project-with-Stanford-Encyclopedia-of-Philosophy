    "main_text": "Climate Modeling\n4. Climate Modeling\n\nModels of the climate system, especially computer simulation models,\nhave come to occupy a central place in both theoretical and applied\nresearch in climate science. After providing an overview of some\ncommon types of climate model\n (Section 4.1),\n this section focuses primarily on atmosphere-ocean general\ncirculation models and earth system models, discussing some noteworthy\nfeatures of their construction\n (Section 4.2),\n some of their most important uses\n (Section 4.3),\n and how they are evaluated\n (Section 4.4).\n The focus is on these complex climate models both because they have\nattracted the most attention from philosophers and, relatedly, because\nthey play particularly important roles in climate research today,\nincluding climate change research.\n",
