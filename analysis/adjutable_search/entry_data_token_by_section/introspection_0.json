    "main_text": "General Features of Introspection || Necessary Features of an Introspective Process\n1.1 Necessary Features of an Introspective Process\n\nIntrospection is generally regarded as a process by means of which we\nlearn about our own currently ongoing, or very recently past, mental\nstates or processes. Not all such processes are introspective,\nhowever: Few would say that you have introspected if you learn that\nyou\u2019re angry by seeing your facial expression in the mirror.\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear and contentious exactly what more is\nrequired for a process to qualify as introspective. A relatively\nrestrictive account of introspection might require introspection to\ninvolve attention to and direct detection of one\u2019s ongoing\nmental states; but many philosophers think attention to or direct\ndetection of mental states is impossible or at least not present in\nmany paradigmatic instances of introspection.\n\nFor a process to qualify as \u201cintrospective\u201d as the term is\nordinarily used in contemporary philosophy of mind, it must minimally\nmeet the following three conditions:\n\n\n\nThe mentality condition: Introspection is a process that\ngenerates, or is aimed at generating, knowledge, judgments, or beliefs\nabout mental events, states, or processes, and not about\naffairs outside one\u2019s mind, at least not directly. In this\nrespect, it is different from sensory processes that normally deliver\ninformation about outward events or about the non-mental aspects of\nthe individual\u2019s body. The border between introspective and\nnon-introspective knowledge can begin to seem blurry with respect to\nbodily self-knowledge such as proprioceptive knowledge about the\nposition of one\u2019s limbs or nociceptive knowledge about\none\u2019s pains. But in principle the introspective part of such\nprocesses, pertaining to judgments about one\u2019s mind\u2014e.g.,\nthat one has the feeling as though one\u2019s arms were crossed or of\ntoe-ishly located pain\u2014can be distinguished from the\nnon-introspective judgment that one\u2019s arms are in fact crossed\nor one\u2019s toe is being pinched.\n\n\nThe first-person condition: Introspection is a process that\ngenerates, or is aimed at generating, knowledge, judgments, or beliefs\nabout one\u2019s own mind only and no one else\u2019s, at\nleast not directly. Any process that in a similar manner generates\nknowledge of one\u2019s own and others\u2019 minds is by that token\nnot an introspective process. (Some philosophers have contemplated\npeculiar or science fiction cases in which we might introspect the\ncontents of others\u2019 minds directly\u2014for example in\ntelepathy or when two people\u2019s brains are directly wired\ntogether\u2014but the proper interpretation of such cases is\ndisputable see, e.g., Gertler 2000.)\n\n\nThe temporal proximity condition: Introspection is a process\nthat generates knowledge, beliefs, or judgments about one\u2019s\ncurrently ongoing mental life only; or, alternatively (or\nperhaps in addition) immediately past (or even future) mental\nlife, within a certain narrow temporal window (sometimes called the\nspecious present; see the entry on the\n experience and perception of time).\n You may know that you were thinking about Montaigne yesterday during\nyour morning walk, but you cannot know that fact by current\nintrospection alone\u2014though perhaps you can know introspectively\nthat you currently have a vivid memory of having thought about\nMontaigne. Likewise, you cannot know by introspection alone that you\nwill feel depressed if your favored candidate loses the election in\nNovember\u2014though perhaps you can know introspectively what your\ncurrent attitude is toward the election or what emotion starts to rise\nin you when you consider the possible outcomes. Whether the target of\nintrospection is best thought of as one\u2019s current mental life or\none\u2019s immediately past mental life may depend on one\u2019s\nmodel of introspection: On self-detection models of introspection,\naccording to which introspection is a causal process involving the\ndetection of a mental state (see Section 2.2 below), it\u2019s\nnatural to suppose that a brief lapse of time will transpire between\nthe occurrence of the mental state that is the introspective target\nand the final introspective judgment about that state, which invites\n(but does not strictly imply) the idea that introspective judgments\ngenerally pertain to immediately past states. On self-shaping and\nself-fulfillment models of introspection, according to which\nintrospective judgments create or embed the very state introspected\n(see Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 below), it seems more natural to think\nthat the target of introspection is one\u2019s current mental life or\nperhaps even the immediate future.\n\n\nFew contemporary philosophers of mind would call a process\n\u201cintrospective\u201d if it does not meet some version of the\nthree conditions above, though in ordinary language the temporal\nproximity condition may sometimes be violated. (For example, in\nordinary speech we might describe as \u201cintrospective\u201d a\nprocess of thinking about why you abandoned a relationship last month\nor whether you\u2019re really as kind to your children as you think\nyou are.) However, many philosophers of mind will resist calling a\nprocess that meets these three conditions \u201cintrospective\u201d\nunless it also meets some or all of the following three\nconditions:\n\n\n\nThe directness condition: Introspection yields judgments or\nknowledge about one\u2019s own current mental processes relatively\ndirectly or immediately. It\u2019s difficult to\narticulate exactly what directness or immediacy involves in the\npresent context, but some examples should make the import of this\ncondition relatively clear. Gathering sensory information about the\nworld and then drawing theoretical conclusions based on that\ninformation should not, according to this condition, count as\nintrospective, even if the process meets the three conditions above.\nSeeing that a car is twenty feet in front of you and then inferring\nfrom that fact about the external world that you are having a visual\nexperience of a certain sort does not, by this condition, count as\nintrospective. However, as we will see in Section 2.3.4 below, those\nwho embrace transparency theories of introspection may reject at least\nstrong formulations of this condition.\n\n\nThe detection condition: Introspection involves some sort of\nattunement to or detection of a\npre-existing mental state or event, where the introspective\njudgment or knowledge is (when all goes well) causally but\nnot ontologically dependent on the target mental state. For\nexample, a process that involved creating the state of mind that one\nattributes to oneself would not be introspective, according to this\ncondition. Suppose I say to myself in silent inner speech, \u201cI am\nsaying to myself in silent inner speech, \u2018haecceities of\napplesauce\u2019\u201d, without any idea ahead of time how I plan to\ncomplete the embedded quotation. Now, what I say may be true, and I\nmay know it to be true, and I may know its truth (in some sense)\ndirectly, by a means by which I could not know the truth of anyone\nelse\u2019s mind. That is, it may meet all the four conditions above\nand yet we may resist calling such a self-attribution introspective.\nSelf-shaping (Section 2.3.2 below), expressivist (Section 2.3.3\nbelow), and transparency (Section 2.3.4 below) accounts of\nself-knowledge emphasize the extent to which our self-knowledge often\ndoes not involve the detection of pre-existing mental states; and\nbecause something like the detection condition is implicitly or\nexplicitly accepted by many philosophers, some philosophers (including\nsome but not all of those who endorse self-shaping, expressivist,\nand/or transparency views) would regard it as inappropriate to regard\nsuch accounts of self-knowledge as accounts of introspection\nproper.\n\n\nThe effort condition: Introspection is not constant,\neffortless, and automatic. We are not every minute of the day\nintrospecting. Introspection involves some sort of special reflection\non one\u2019s own mental life that differs from the ordinary\nun-self-reflective flow of thought and action. The mind may monitor\nitself regularly and constantly without requiring any special act of\nreflection by the thinker\u2014for example, at a non-conscious level\ncertain parts of the brain or certain functional systems may monitor\nthe goings-on of other parts of the brain and other functional\nsystems, and this monitoring may meet all five conditions\nabove\u2014but this sort of thing is not what philosophers generally\nhave in mind when they talk of introspection. However, this condition,\nlike the directness and detection conditions, is not universally\naccepted. For example, philosophers who think that conscious\nexperience requires some sort of introspective monitoring of the mind\nand who think of conscious experience as a more or less constant\nfeature of our lives may reject the effort condition (Armstrong 1968,\n1999; Lycan 1996).\n\n\nThough not all philosophical accounts that are put forward by their\nauthors as accounts of \u201cintrospection\u201d meet all of\nconditions 4\u20136, most meet at least two of those. Because of\ndifferences in the importance accorded to conditions 4\u20136, it is\nnot unusual for authors with otherwise similar accounts of\nself-knowledge to differ in their willingness to describe their\naccounts as accounts of \u201cintrospection\u201d.\n",
