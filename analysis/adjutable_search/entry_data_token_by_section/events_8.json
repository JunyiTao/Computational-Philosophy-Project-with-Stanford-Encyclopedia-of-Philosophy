    "main_text": "Types of Events || Negative Events\n2.5 Negative Events\n\nEvents are things that happen. In some cases, however, the same sort\nof prima facie evidence that suggests a realist attitude\ntowards such things might suggest a similar attitude towards things\nthat do not actually happen, including \u201cnegative actions\u201d\nof various sorts (Danto 1966; Ryle 1973). We speak of Anita\u2019s\nwalk with the same easiness with which we speak of the talk she did\nnot deliver, the nap she did not take, the party she failed to\norganize; we seem to quantify over such things, and we normally engage\nin causal talk that seems to refer explicitly to negative causes, as\nwhen we reason that Anita\u2019s failure to turn off the gas caused\nan explosion, or that her omitting the cutlery from the wedding list\nmade Susan angry. Some authors take such evidence at face value,\ndrawing a distinction at the ontological level: a good inventory of\nthe world ought to include \u201cnegative\u201d events and actions\nalong with ordinary, \u201cpositive\u201d ones (Lee 1978; Vermazen\n1985; De Swart 1996; Przepi\u00f3rkowski 1999; Higginbotham 2000;\nMossel 2009; Silver 2018; Bernard & Champollion 2018). Others\ndissent: we often speak as though there were such things, but\ndeep down we want our words to be interpreted in such a way as to\navoid ontological commitment. Thus, either we are just engaging in\nmere counterfactual speculations, or else the putative negative events\nare just ordinary, positive events under a negative description:\n\u2018Anita\u2019s omitting the cutlery from the wedding\nlist\u2019, for example, would refer to her drawing up a wedding list\nthat contains no cutlery, \u2018Mary\u2019s not moving\u2019 would\ndescribe Mary\u2019s working hard to master urges to move, etc. (Mele\n2005; Varzi 2008). The latter view can also be construed in\nmetaphysical (as opposed to semantic) terms, at least in some cases:\nfor x to omit to \u03c6 (refrain from \u03c6-ing, etc.) at\nt would be for x to ensure, through their actual\nbehavior, that they do not \u03c6 at t (Payton 2016, 2018).\n\n\nThe case of negative causation is especially challenging, not last\nbecause of the link between causation and such ethical and legal\nmatters as passive killing (Bennett 1966; Green 1980; Foot 1984), good\nSamaritanism (Kleinig 1976) and, more generally, moral responsibility\n(Weinryb 1980; Walton 1980; Williams 1995; Fischer 1997; Clarke 2014).\nHere it is also customary to introduce finer-grained discriminations,\ndistinguishing several ways in which an agent may fail to do\nsomething, e.g. (trying and) not succeeding,\nrefraining, omitting, and allowing (Brand\n1971; Milanich 1984; Hall 1984; Bach 2010). At least with regard to\nsome such ways, it is very tempting to endorse a realist ontology. If\nso, the difficulty naturally arises of how and where to draw the line.\nFor example, the realist about omissions will have to find a\nprincipled way of refraining from treating all omissions, including\nnon-salient ones, as causes (Gorr 1979; Lewis 1986a, 2004;\nThomson 2003; Menzies 2004; McGrath 2005; Sartorio 2009; Bernstein\n2014). On the other hand, the antirealist will have to explain how one\ncan account for such causal talk while holding on to the view that\nevery causal situation develops from \u201cpositive factors\nalone\u201d (Armstrong 1999). Some would insist that every alleged\ncase of negative causation can be described in terms of positive\ncausation (Lalibert\u00e9 2013). Others\u2014the\nmajority\u2014would resist ontological commitment by recasting the\nlogical structure of the relevant causal claims in suitable ways, e.g.\nas causal statements about events that are counterfactually described\n(Hunt 2005), or as \u201cquasi-causal\u201d claims about what would\nhave been a cause if the omitted event had happened (Dowe 2001), or as\nmere causal explanations in which the explanans does not stand to the\nexplanandum as cause to effect (Beebee 2004; Varzi 2007; Lombard &\nHudson 2020).\n",
