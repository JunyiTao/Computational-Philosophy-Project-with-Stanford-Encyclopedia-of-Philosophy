    "main_text": "The Basic Structure of the Conventional Formulation || Interaction\n2.2 Interaction\n\n\nUp to this point, the aim was to develop a free field theory. Doing\nso does not only neglect interaction with other particles (fields), it\nis even unrealistic for one free particle because it interacts with\nthe field that it generates itself. For the description of\ninteractions\u2014such as scattering in particle colliders\u2014we need certain extensions and modifications of the formalism. The\nimmediate contact between scattering experiments and QFT is given by\nthe scattering or S-matrix which contains all the relevant predictive\ninformation about, e.g., scattering cross sections. \nThere are many schemes to calculate the S-matrix, among which one introduces the\nHamiltonian formalism. The Hamiltonian density can be derived from the Lagrangian density by means of a Legendre transformation.\n\n\nTo discuss interactions it is convenient to introduce a new\nrepresentation, the interaction picture, which is an\nalternative to the Schr\u00f6dinger and the Heisenberg picture. For\nthe interaction picture one splits up the Hamiltonian, which is the\ngenerator of time-translations, into two parts \\(H = H_0 +\nH_{\\textit{int}}\\), where \\(H_0\\) describes the free system, i.e.,\nwithout interaction. It is solved exactly, and gets absorbed in a\nre-definition of the fields. Then \\(H_{\\textit{int}}\\) is the\ninteraction part of the Hamiltonian, or short the \u2018interaction\nHamiltonian.\u2019 Using the interaction picture is advantageous\nbecause the equations of motion as well as, under certain conditions,\nthe commutation relations are the same for interacting fields as for\nfree fields. Therefore, various results that were established for free\nfields can still be used in the case of interacting fields. The\ncentral instrument for the description of scattering is again the\nS-matrix, which expresses the connection between in and out states by\nspecifying the transition amplitudes. In QED, for instance, a state\n\\(|\\textit{in}\\rangle\\) describes one particular configuration of electrons,\npositrons and photons, i.e., it describes how many of these particles\nthere are and which momenta, spins and polarizations they have before\nthe interaction. The S-matrix supplies the transition amplitude that\nthis state goes over to a particular \\(|\\textit{out}\\rangle\\) state,\ne.g., that a particular counter responds after the interaction. The\ntransition amplitude is squared to form a probability, and such\nprobabilities are checked in experiments.\n\n\nThe canonical formalism of QFT as introduced in the previous section\nis only applicable in the case of free fields since the inclusion of\ninteraction leads to infinities (see the historical part). Since\nlittle of realistic models can be solved exactly, perturbation theory\nmakes up a large part of most publications on QFT. The importance of\nperturbative methods is understandable realizing that they establish\nthe immediate contact between theory and experiment. Although the\ntechniques of perturbation theory have become ever more sophisticated\nit is somewhat disturbing that perturbative methods are difficult to\navoid. Some have argued this is a matter of principle. (And on the\nother hand, physicists have been astonishingly creative in developing\n\u201ctoy models\u2014 that can be solved exactly, precisely to\nescape perturbation theory.)  One reason for unease is that\nperturbation theory is felt to be rather a matter of (highly\nsophisticated) craftsmanship than of understanding\nnature. Accordingly, the corpus of perturbative methods plays a small\nrole in philosophical investigations of QFT. Two recent exceptions are\nFraser (2018) and Passon (2019). What does matter, however, is in\nwhich sense the consideration of realistic interactions affects the\ngeneral framework of QFT. An overview about perturbation theory is\ngiven in section 4.1 (\u201cPerturbation Theory\u2014Philosophy and\nExamples\u201d) of Peskin & Schroeder (1995).\n",
