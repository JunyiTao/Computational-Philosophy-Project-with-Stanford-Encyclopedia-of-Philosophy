    "main_text": "Modes of Evolution\n2. Modes of Evolution\n\nIt is essential to understand that biologists recognize many ways that\nevolution can occur, evolution by\n natural selection\n being just one of them, although it is often held to be the most\nprevalent one. Evolution can also occur through genetic drift,\nmutation, or migration. It can also occur through sexual selection,\nwhich some consider to be a form of natural selection and others\nconsider to be distinct from natural selection (the latter having been\nDarwin\u2019s 1859, 1874 view). Evolutionary theory, then, can be\ntaken to be the study (including, but not limited to, mathematical\nmodels) of these and other modes of evolution.\n\nTo see why it makes sense to think of multiple modes of evolution,\nconsider again one of the definitions of evolution presented above,\nwhere evolution is understood as \u201cany change in the frequency of\nalleles within a population from one generation to the next\u201d.\nWith natural selection, the frequency of alleles that confer greater\nfitness would tend to increase over those which confer lesser fitness.\nSexual selection would be the same, but with fitness understood\nstrictly in terms of mating ability. With genetic drift, a form of\nevolution that involves chance (see the entry on\n genetic drift\n  for explanation), there could be an increase in the frequency\nof alleles that confer greater fitness, an increase in the frequency\nof alleles that confer lesser fitness, or an increase in the frequency\nof alleles whose manifestation (if any) was neutral. If organisms\nmigrate from one population to another, it is likely that there will\nbe a change in the frequency of alleles in both populations. And if\nthere is a mutation from one allele to another, then the frequency of\nalleles in the population will likewise change, albeit by a small\namount. Distinguishing these different modes of evolution allows\nbiologists to track the various factors that are relevant to\nevolutionary changes in a population.\n\nThe careful reader may have noted that the previous paragraph invoked\nprobabilistic language: what tends to happen, what\ncould happen, what is likely to happen. Indeed,\nmathematical evolutionary models today (see the entry on\n population genetics)\n are typically statistical models. This fact about evolutionary\nmodels has given rise to a debate in the philosophy of evolution over\nwhether natural selection and genetic drift should be be understood as\ncauses of evolution, as most biologists conceive them, or as mere\nstatistical summaries of lower-level causes: births, deaths, etc. (The\n natural selection\n and\n genetic drift\n entries give more information about this debate). It is for this\nreason that this entry uses the more neutral phrase \u201cmodes of\nevolution\u201d so as not to beg any questions under dispute between\nthe causalist and the statisticalist.\n\nAlthough there is widespread agreement that there are multiple modes\nof evolution, much contemporary work in biology and philosophy of\nbiology has been focused on natural selection. Whether this focus is a\ngood thing or not is in part what the debate over\n adaptationism\n is about. That is, do we have reason to think that natural selection\nis the most prevalent or most important mode of evolution? Should\nscientific methodologies be geared toward testing natural selection\nhypotheses or toward a variety of possible evolutionary modes? The\nfocus on natural selection has also led to a large literature on the\nconcept of\n fitness,\n given that population genetics\u2019 definitions and other\ndefinitions of natural selection typically invoke fitness; a natural\nselection explanation of why X was more successful than\nY might invoke X\u2019s higher fitness. What fitness\nmeans, what entities it applies to (genes, organisms, groups,\nindividuals, types), what sort of probabilities it invokes, if any,\nand how it should be calculated, are all under philosophical dispute.\nThere is also a large literature on conceptually and empirically\ndistinguishing natural selection from genetic drift. Migration,\nmutation (as a mode of evolution), and sexual selection have received\nless attention from philosophers of biology.\n",
