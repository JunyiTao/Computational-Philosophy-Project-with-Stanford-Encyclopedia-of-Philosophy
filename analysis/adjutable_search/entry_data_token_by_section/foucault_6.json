    "main_text": "Major Works || History of the Prison\n3.4 History of the Prison\n\nDiscipline and Punish, published in 1975, is a genealogical\nstudy of the development of the \u201cgentler\u201d modern way of\nimprisoning criminals rather than torturing or killing them. While\nrecognizing the element of genuinely enlightened reform, Foucault\nparticularly emphasizes how such reform also becomes a vehicle of more\neffective control: \u201cto punish less, perhaps; but certainly to\npunish better\u201d(1975 [1977: 82]). He further argues that the new\nmode of punishment becomes the model for control of an entire society,\nwith factories, hospitals, and schools modeled on the modern prison.\nWe should not, however, think that the deployment of this model was\ndue to the explicit decisions of some central controlling agency.\nFoucault\u2019s analysis shows how techniques and institutions,\ndeveloped for different and often quite innocuous purposes, converged\nto create the modern system of disciplinary power.\n\nAt the core of Foucault\u2019s picture of modern disciplinary society\nare three primary techniques of control: hierarchical observation,\nnormalizing judgment, and the examination. To a great extent, control\nover people (power) can be achieved merely by observing them. So, for\nexample, the tiered rows of seats in a stadium not only makes it easy\nfor spectators to see but also for guards or security cameras to scan\nthe audience. A perfect system of observation would allow one guard to\nsee everything (a situation approximated, as we shall see, in Jeremy\nBentham\u2019s Panopticon). But since this is not usually possible,\nthere is a need for \u201crelays\u201d of observers, hierarchically\nordered, through whom observed data passes from lower to higher\nlevels.\n\nA distinctive feature of modern power (disciplinary control) is its\nconcern with what people have not done (nonobservence), with, that is,\na person\u2019s failure to reach required standards. This concern\nillustrates the primary function of modern disciplinary systems: to\ncorrect deviant behavior. The main goal is not revenge (as in the case\nof the tortures of premodern punishment) but reform, where reform\nmeans primarily coming to live by society\u2019s standards or norms.\nDiscipline through imposing precise and detailed norms,\n\u201cnormalization,\u201d is quite different from the older system\nof judicial punishment, which merely judges each action as either\nallowed or not allowed by the law and does not indicate whether those\njudged are \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cabnormal.\u201d This idea\nof normalization is pervasive in our society: e.g., national standards\nfor educational programs, for medical practice, for industrial\nprocesses and products.\n\nThe examination (for example, of students in schools, of patients in\nhospitals) is a method of control that combines hierarchical\nobservation with normalizing judgment. It is a prime example of what\nFoucault calls power/knowledge, since it combines into a unified whole\n\u201cthe deployment of force and the establishment of truth\u201d\n(1975 [1977: 184]). It both elicits the truth about those who undergo\nthe examination (tells what they know or what is the state of their\nhealth) and controls their behavior (by forcing them to study or\ndirecting them to a course of treatment).\n\nOn Foucault\u2019s account, the relation of power and knowledge is\nfar closer than in the familiar Baconian engineering model, for which\n\u201cknowledge is power\u201d means that knowledge is an instrument\nof power, although the two exist quite independently. Foucault\u2019s\npoint is rather that, at least for the study of human beings, the\ngoals of power and the goals of knowledge cannot be separated: in\nknowing we control and in controlling we know.\n\nThe examination also situates individuals in a \u201cfield of\ndocumentation.\u201d The results of exams are recorded in documents\nthat provide detailed information about the individuals examined and\nallow power systems to control them (e.g., absentee records for\nschools, patients\u2019 charts in hospitals). On the basis of these\nrecords, those in control can formulate categories, averages, and\nnorms that are in turn a basis for knowledge. The examination turns\nthe individual into a \u201ccase\u201d\u2014in both senses of the\nterm: a scientific example and an object of care. Caring is always\nalso an opportunity for control.\n\nBentham\u2019s Panopticon is, for Foucault, a paradigmatic\narchitectural model of modern disciplinary power. It is a design for a\nprison, built so that each inmate is separated from and invisible to\nall the others (in separate \u201ccells\u201d) and each inmate is\nalways visible to a guard situated in a central tower. Guards do not\nin fact always see each inmate; the point is that they could\nat any time. Since inmates never know whether they are being observed,\nthey must behave as if they are always seen and observed. As a result,\ncontrol is achieved more by the possibility of internal monitoring of\nthose controlled than by actual supervision or heavy physical\nconstraints.\n\nThe principle of the Panopticon can be applied not only to prisons but\nalso to any system of disciplinary power (a factory, a hospital, a\nschool). And, in fact, although Bentham himself was never able to\nbuild it, its principle has come to pervade aspects of modern society.\nIt is the instrument through which modern discipline has been able to\nreplace pre-modern sovereignty (kings, judges) as the fundamental\npower relation.\n\nFoucault\u2019s genealogy follows Nietzsche as well as existential\nphenomenology in that it aims to bring the body into the focus of\nhistory. Rather than histories of mentalities or ideas, genealogies\nare \u201chistories of the body.\u201d They examine the historical\npractices through which the body becomes an object of techniques and\ndeployments of power. In Discipline and Punish, Foucault\nshows how disciplinary techniques produce \u201cdocile bodies\u201d:\nbodies of prisoners, soldiers, workers and schoolchildren were\nsubjected to disciplinary power in order to make them more useful and\nat the same time easier to control. The human body became a machine\nthe functioning of which could be optimized, calculated, and improved.\nIts functions, movements and capabilities were broken down into narrow\nsegments, analyzed in detail and recomposed in a maximally effective\nway.\n\nBy historicizing the body, Foucault\u2019s genealogies also have\ndistinctive philosophical implications. They question the naturalistic\nexplanatory framework that understands human nature\u2014uncovered by\nscience\u2014as the basis for such complex areas of behavior as\nsexuality, insanity or criminality. A key idea in Foucault\u2019s\nhistorical analysis of the modern penal institutions is that they\noperate with markedly different rationality than those that are aimed\nsolely at retribution through pain. He effectively reveals the double\nrole of the present system: it aims at both punishing and correcting,\nand therefore it mixes juridical and scientific practices. Foucault\nargued that the intervention of criminal psychiatry in the field of\nlaw that occurred at the beginning of the nineteenth century, for\nexample, was part of the gradual shift in penal practice from a focus\non the crime to a focus on the criminal, from the action to agency and\npersonality. The new idea of the \u201cdangerous individual\u201d\nreferred to the danger potentially inherent in the criminal person.\nThe new rationality could not function in an effective way in the\nexisting system without the emergence of new forms of scientific\nknowledge such as criminal psychiatry that enabled the\ncharacterization of criminals in themselves, beneath their acts.\nFoucault suggests that this shift resulted in the emergence of new,\ninsidious forms of domination and violence. The critical impact of\nDiscipline and Punish thus lies in its ability to reveal the\nprocesses of subject formation that operate in modern penal\ninstitutions. The modern prison does not just punish by depriving its\ninmates of liberty, it categorizes them as delinquent subjects, types\nof people with a dangerous, criminal nature.\n",
