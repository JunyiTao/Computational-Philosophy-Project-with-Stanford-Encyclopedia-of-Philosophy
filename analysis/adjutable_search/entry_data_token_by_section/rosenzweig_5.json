    "main_text": "Personal and Intellectual Development || Hermann Cohen\n1.5 Hermann Cohen\n\n\nDuring the following year, Rosenzweig rededicated himself to Judaism\nby enrolling in courses at the Berlin \u201cHochschule f\u00fcr die\nWissenschaft des Judentums.\u201d Hermann Cohen, the esteemed\nneo-Kantian, had retired from his professorship in Marburg the year\nbefore and was teaching at the Hochschule, and Rosenzweig developed an\nespecially close relationship with the elder philosopher. Rosenzweig\nformulated his earliest ideas on Jewish education through a public\ncorrespondence with Cohen, and it was in the wake of that exchange that\nCohen worked together with Rosenzweig and his father\u2014in the\nmonths before both Cohen and Rosenzweig\u2019s father died\u2014to\nestablish a new \u201cAcademy for the Study of Judaism\u201d meant to\nadvance both scholarship in the field of Jewish Studies and a new\nprogram for Jewish communal education. In the month before\nhis death, furthermore, Cohen allowed Rosenzweig to read the proofs to his last\ngreat work, Religion of Reason out of the Sources of Judaism,\npublished after his death, in 1919. Rosenzweig found in this work what\nhe took to be a significant break away from Cohen\u2019s critical\nIdealism, and from the Idealist tradition in general. Moreover, in the\nbook\u2019s presentation of God and the human being as\n\u201ccorrelated,\u201d as independent but at once reciprocally\ndetermining one another, Rosenzweig believed to discover an\nanticipation of his own developing view of actuality as grounded in the\nreciprocal relations between God, self, and world.\n",
