    "main_text": "Understanding Constructive Empiricism || Contrast with Logical Positivism\n1.3 Contrast with Logical Positivism\n\nOne of the reasons constructive empiricism is viewed as significant is\nthat it carries on the tradition of the logical positivists without\nbeing saddled with the problematic aspects of the positivists\u2019\npositions. The constructive empiricist follows the logical positivists\nin rejecting metaphysical commitments in science, but she parts with\nthem regarding their endorsement of the verificationist criterion of\nmeaning, as well as their endorsement of the suggestion that\ntheory-laden discourse can and should be removed from science. Before\nvan Fraassen\u2019s The Scientific Image, some philosophers\nhad viewed scientific anti-realism as dead, because logical positivism\nwas dead. Van Fraassen showed that there were other ways to be an\nempiricist with respect to science, without following in the footsteps\nof the logical positivists.\n",
