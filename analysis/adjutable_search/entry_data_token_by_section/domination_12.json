    "main_text": "Domination and Applied Ethics\n6. Conclusion\n\nNothing is less surprising than persistent disagreement in philosophy,\nbut the persistence of disagreement about domination is connected to\nan interesting question about where the discussion should go from\nhere: What do we want a theory of domination to do? Is our theory of\ndomination supposed to tell us when people are free and when they are\nnot? Do we want our theory of domination to give us insight into the\nnature of social injustice? To diagnose political misrule? To motivate\na theory of democracy? To describe the underclass in late capitalist\nsocieties? To capture the complaint of racial minorities in oppressive\nracialized hierarchies? All of the above? All theories of domination\nare not equally suited to each of these tasks; as a consequence, the\nappeal of individual theories may differ according to which we find\nmost pressing.\n\nA related question, at present under-explored in the literature, is\nhow domination does or does not relate to other concepts often used to\ndescribe power-related injustices: for example, exploitation,\noppression, and subjugation. Young (1990 [2011])\ndistinguishes between domination and oppression, identifying the\nformer with asymmetric power over action and the contexts of action,\nand the latter with the more diffuse and sometimes unconscious shaping\nof institutions in ways that deny some social groups the capacity to\nunderstand and express themselves except from the perspective of the\nprivileged. Unfortunately, few have followed her in working out a\nsimilar division of labor between these concepts. (For an interesting\nexceptions, see Bellamy 2007: 151\u2013152.) More common is the\nneorepublican assumption that concern for injustices like oppression\ncan be folded into concern for domination (Pettit 1997: 80). Just as\nall theories of domination are not equally suited to every task we\nmight put them to, it may be that attention to domination itself\nshould be supplemented by attention to other varieties of injustice.\nIf nothing else, recent work on domination has dramatically sharpened\nour understanding of such injustice, even if all its varieties cannot\nusefully be diagnosed as manifestations of this single ill.\n",
