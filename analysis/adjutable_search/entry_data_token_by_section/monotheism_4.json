Scotus\u2019s fourth proof is based on the theistic\nintuition that God is the complete or total cause of everything else.\nHis argument is roughly this:\n\nNecessarily, if anything is a god, its creative volition is the\nnecessary and sufficient causal condition of every other concrete\nobject.\n\n\n\nSuppose, then, that\n\nContingent beings exist and there are two gods.\n\n\n\nIt follows that\n\nEach is the necessary and sufficient causal condition of the set of\ncontingent beings. (From 1 and 2.)\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe first is a sufficient causal condition of the set of contingent\nbeings. (From 3.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nThe second is not a necessary causal condition of the set of\ncontingent beings. (From 4.)\n\n\n\nAgain,\n\nThe first is a necessary causal condition of the set of contingent\nbeings. (From 3.)\n\n\n\nSo\n\nThe second is not a sufficient causal condition of the existence of\nthe set of contingent beings. (From 6.)\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe second is neither a necessary nor a sufficient causal condition\nof the set of contingent beings. (From 5 and 7.)\n\n\n\nA similar argument will show that\n\nThe first is neither a necessary nor a sufficient causal condition\nof the existence of the set of contingent beings.\n\n\n\nIt follows that\n\nNeither god is either a necessary or a sufficient condition of the\nexistence of the set of contingent beings. (From 8 and 9.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nIf contingent beings existed and there were two gods, each would be\na necessary and sufficient causal condition of the existence of the set\nof contingent beings and neither would be a necessary and sufficient\ncausal condition of the existence of the set of contingent beings.\n(From 2 through 10.)\n\n\n\nBut since\n\nThe consequent of 11 is impossible,\n\n\nIts antecedent is impossible. (From 11 and 12. If p\nentails q, and q is impossible, then p is\nimpossible.)\n\n\n\nThus,\n\nIt is impossible that contingent beings exist and there are two\ngods. (From 13.)\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIf contingent beings exist, there cannot be two gods. (From 14.)\n(Scotus, 87)\n\n\n\nScotus\u2019s argument is firmly rooted in the theistic intuition that\nGod\u2019s creative volition is the necessary and sufficient causal\ncondition of everything that exists outside him. But as it stands it\nsuffers from two weaknesses.\n\n\nFirst, the argument doesn\u2019t show that God is necessarily\nunique but only that if contingent beings exist, only one God\nexists. The second, and more serious, difficulty arises from the fact\nthat there are at least two relevant senses of \u201csufficient causal\ncondition.\u201d\n\n\nStriking a match is a causally sufficient condition of the match\u2019s\nignition in a standard sense since, under normal conditions, if one\nstrikes the match, it will ignite. Many other conditions are causally\nnecessary for this event to occur, however\u2014the presence of\noxygen, the match\u2019s not being wet, and the like. But in a stronger\nsense, x is a causally sufficient condition of y if\nand only if given x alone, y exists or occurs. And in\nthat sense, striking the match is not causally\nsufficient for the match\u2019s ignition since other conditions are needed\nas well.\n\n\nThe problem with Scotus\u2019s argument, then, is this. The inferences\nfrom 4 to 5, and from 6 to 7, are valid only upon the assumption that\nif a cause is sufficient to produce an effect no other cause is a\nnecessary condition of that effect. But this is true only if a causally\nsufficient condition is such that it alone suffices to produce its\neffect, that is, if it is causally sufficient in the strong sense. If\n\u201ccausally sufficient condition\u201d is taken in the\nstrong sense, however, there are reasons to believe that the argument\u2019s\nfirst premise is false. Suppose, for example, that Abel would exist if\nand only if Adam and Eve were to freely copulate, and Adam and Eve\nwould freely copulate if and only if God were to create them. By\ncreating Adam and Eve, God brings about Abel\u2019s existence. Furthermore,\ngiven the truth of the relevant subjunctive conditionals, there is a\nclear sense in which God\u2019s doing so is not only a necessary but also a\nsufficient causal condition of Abel\u2019s existence. For if God creates\nAdam and Eve, Adam and Eve will beget Abel. It isn\u2019t sufficient in the\nstrong sense, however, because God\u2019s creating Adam and Eve won\u2019t, all\nby itself, ensure Abel\u2019s existence. For that to occur, Adam and Eve\u2019s\nfree decision to copulate is also needed. Theistic intuitions clearly\nsupport the claim that it is necessarily true that God\u2019s creative\nvolitions are a causally sufficient condition of the existence of every\nother concrete object in at least a weak sense. It is less clear that\nthey support the claim that it is necessarily true that God\u2019s creative\nvolitions are a causally sufficient condition of the existence of every\nother concrete object in the strong sense. (Theists with robust views\nof human freedom, for example, will deny that they are.)\n\n\nThe problem, in short is this. In order to be valid,\n\u201csufficient causal condition\u201d must be used in the same\nsense throughout the argument. If \u201ccausally sufficient\ncondition\u201d is taken in the weak sense, however, then the\ninferences from 4 to 5, and from 6 to 7, are illegitimate. Yet if\n\u201ccasually sufficient condition\u201d is taken in the strong\nsense, there are reasons to believe that its first premise is false. In\neither case, the argument is unsound.\n\n\nBoth defects can be remedied, though. Even theists with robust views\nof human freedom would presumably endorse\n\n\n1*.\nNecessarily, if any x is God, then for every concrete\nobject distinct from x, the activity of x is a\ncausally necessary condition for its existence, and if there are in\nfact one or more contingent beings distinct from x, then the\nactivity of x is causally sufficient (in the strong sense)\nfor the existence of at least one of them.\n\n\n\n\n(1*) is sufficient to yield our conclusion. For if the first god is\na causally necessary condition of the existence of every other concrete\nobject, then the second god is not a causally sufficient condition (in\nthe strong sense) of the existence of any contingent being.\nSimilarly, if the first god is a causally sufficient condition (in the\nstrong sense) of the existence of at least one contingent being, then\nthe second god is not a necessary condition of the existence of at\nleast one concrete object that is distinct from itself. And, of course,\nsimilar conclusions are true of the second god.\n\n\nMoreover, if God is a necessary being as many theists believe (that\nis, if God exists and is God in every possible world), then the\nargument\u2019s first defect can be remedied as well, since the mere\npossibility of the existence of contingent beings will be\nsufficient to establish God\u2019s necessary unicity. For consider the\nfollowing argument:\n\n\n1*.\nNecessarily, if any x is God, then for every concrete\nobject distinct from x, the activity of x is a\ncausally necessary condition for its existence, and if there are in\nfact one or more contingent beings distinct from x, then the\nactivity of x is causally sufficient (in the strong sense) for\nthe existence of at least one of them.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose, then, that\n\nThere are two gods and contingent beings are possible.\n\n\n\nIt follows that\n\nThere is a possible world, w, in which contingent beings\nexist (from 16), and that, because each god is necessary,\n\n\nBoth gods exist in w. (From 16.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nEach god is a necessary causal condition of the existence of each\ncontingent being in w, and each god is the sufficient causal\ncondition (in the strong sense) of the existence of at least one\ncontingent being in w. (From 1*, 17, and 18.)\n\n\n\nBut,\n\nIt is impossible that each god is a necessary causal condition of\nthe existence of each contingent being in w, and each god is\nthe sufficient causal condition (in the strong sense) of at least one\ncontingent being in w. (For, as we have seen, if one god is a\nnecessary causal condition of the existence of each contingent being in\nw, the other is not the sufficient causal condition [in the\nstrong sense] of any of them.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nIt is impossible that there are two gods and contingent beings are\npossible, that is, it is necessarily true that if contingent beings are\npossible, it is false that there are two gods. (From 1* through 20. If\na proposition [e.g., 16] together with one or more necessary truths\n[e.g., 1*] entails another [e.g., 19], and the second is impossible,\nthe first is impossible.)\n\n\n\nBut,\n\nIt is logically possible that contingent beings exist. (For they do\nexist.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nIt is necessarily true that it is logically possible that\ncontingent beings exist. (From 22. What is possible is necessarily\npossible.)\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIt is necessarily false that there are two gods. (From 21, 23, and\nthe principle that if one proposition entails another and the first is\nnecessarily true, then the second is necessarily true.)\n\n",
