    "main_text": "Key Doctrines || The Will to Power\n6.1 The Will to Power\n\nThe will to power doctrine seems to claim that everything that exists\nrests fundamentally on an underlying basis of\n\u201cpower-centers\u201d, whose activity and interactions are\nexplained by a principle that they pursue the expansion of their\npower. But it is far from obvious what these\n\u201cpower-centers\u201d are supposed to be, and much scholarly\ncontroversy concerns what kind of doctrine Nietzsche intended to\nadvance in the first place. Some readers take it as Nietzsche\u2019s\nversion of a foundational metaphysics (see Heidegger 1961, Jaspers\n[1936] 1965, and for a sophisticated recent approach in the same broad\nvein, Richardson 1996; see also alternative accounts by Doyle 2019 and\nRemhof 2017). Others receive it as an anti-essentialist rejection of\ntraditional metaphysical theorizing in which abstract and shifting\npower-centers replace stable entities (Nehamas 1985: 74\u2013105,\nPoellner 1995: 137\u201398), or else as a psychological hypothesis\n(Kaufmann [1950] 1974, Soll 2015; Clark and Dudrick 2015), or a\n(quasi-)scientific conjecture (Schacht 1983; Abel 1984; Anderson 1994,\n2012b). Opposing all such readings of the will to power as a doctrine\nin theoretical philosophy, Maudemarie Clark (2000, see also 1990:\n205\u201344) reads the will to power as a strand of thought that\nmakes no claim about the world, but instead expresses\nNietzsche\u2019s values. As we saw (3.B.i.), the idea that the\nexpansion of power is good does have a better claim than other\nprinciples to systematize Nietzsche\u2019s various value commitments,\nand different evaluative interpretations have been developed by\nReginster (2006), Katsafanas (2013), Hussain (2011), and Richardson\n(2020: 53\u201380). But there are also a large number of other texts\nsuggesting that Nietzsche\u2019s main agenda was to argue that the\npsychological world\u2014or the world as a whole\u2014is\nfundamentally composed of centers of power exerting force against one\nanother (see GS 13; BGE 23, 36, 259; GM II,\n16\u201317; III, 13\u201315; as well as many passages from the\nnotebooks). Nietzsche\u2019s description of such \u201cpower\ncenters\u201d is sometimes fairly abstract, evoking mathematically\ncharacterized \u201cforce-centers\u201d like those sometimes\npostulated in nineteenth century physics, but at other times, concrete\npsychological or biological entities (people, drives, organisms) are\nthe things exerting will to power.\n\nReginster\u2019s (2006, 2018a) account of the will to power as a\ndrive toward overcoming resistance can marshal a large body of textual\nsupport (particularly from the notebooks), and it also has some\nparticular philosophical advantages. From a dialectical point of view,\nReginster\u2019s reading substantially clarifies the target and the\nphilosophical point of Nietzsche\u2019s views about power: they are\naimed against Schopenhauer\u2019s ideas about the will to life and\nhis use of those ideas to motivate pessimism. The will to power\nthereby contributes directly to Nietzsche\u2019s program of\ncombatting nihilism (in its guise as the evaluative claim that the\nworld ought not to exist). Reginster\u2019s reading also makes good\nsense of the apparent centrality of the will to power in\nNietzsche\u2019s psychology. In the same passage where he claims that\npsychology should \u201cbe recognized again as the queen of the\nsciences\u201d, Nietzsche proposes to understand psychology \u201cas\nthe morphology and development-theory of the will to\npower\u201d (BGE 23). Some commentators take this to\nsuggest a monistic psychology in which all drives whatsoever aim at\npower, and so count as manifestations of a single underlying drive (or\ndrive-type). That interpretation makes a poor fit for the prodigious\ndiversity of Nietzsche\u2019s actual psychological explanations (and\nfor his pluralist leanings), but Reginster\u2019s view redirects\nattention away from drives\u2019 first-order aims toward a general\nstructural feature of drives\u2014their tendency to overcome\nresistance in the course of pursuing whatever first-order activities\nthey pursue. (It thereby builds on a productive earlier line of\nthought from Richardson (1996), according to which the drives\u2019\nwilling power is not a matter of their taking power as a first-order\naim, but concerns the manner of their pursuit of various\nfirst-order aims.) The Reginster account thereby permits the will to\npower to retain an important centrality within Nietzsche\u2019s\npsychology, without needing to claim that no one (or no drive) ever\naims at anything else besides power.\n\nOther scholars have emphasized Nietzsche\u2019s speculations that\nbiological and physical phenomena could be explained by a postulated\nsystem of interacting power centers (Abel 1984; M\u00fcller-Lauter\n1999a; Moore 2002; Gemes 2013). Abel (1984) offers a particularly\nsystematic and carefully argued version of the approach, which\nhighlights important resonances between Nietzsche\u2019s ideas and\nelements of Leibniz\u2019s dynamical physics and metaphysics, whereas\nMoore (2002) pursues a fascinating line of connections between\nNietzsche\u2019s thoughts about power and certain physiological ideas\nadvanced by Wilhelm Roux (1881). Moore\u2019s reading emphasizes the\nbiologized rhetoric Nietzsche often uses in his talk about power\n(together with its connections to health and sickness, degeneration,\netc.) as part of a case that the will to power idea locates\nNietzsche\u2019s philosophy within a wider intellectual trend toward\n\u201cbiologism\u201d prevalent at the end of the nineteenth\ncentury.\n",
