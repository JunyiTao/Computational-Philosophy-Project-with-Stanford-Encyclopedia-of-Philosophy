    "main_text": "Developmental and Evolutionary Implications || Regulation and control\n4.5 Regulation and control\n\nAlready in 1958 David Nanney suggested that the difference between\ngenetic and what we would now call cellular epigenetic inheritance\nlies not in their physical location (i.e., whether they lie in the\nnucleus or the cytoplasm), but rather that the genetic system\nmaintains a set of \u201clibrary specifications\u201d while the\nepigenetic control system (to use his terminology) determines\nwhich specificities are expressed in each particular cell, accounting\nfor cell differentiation (Nanney 1958). Thus, according to Nanney, the\nepigenetic inheritance system plays a regulatory role in relation to\nthe genetic system.\n\nConsidering epigenetic control systems as providing a regulatory\nfunction allowed Nanney to suggest that they may be expected to (1) be\nless stable, (2) be more susceptible to extrinsic control than genetic\nsystems, and (3) exhibit a limited number of \u201cstates\u201d,\nsince they are constrained by the information available in the genetic\nsystem at each particular time (Nanney 1958). These properties are\nindeed exhibited by the cellular epigenetic systems that have since\nbeen identified, which play a role in cellular (e.g., genomic)\nregulation. DNA methylation and histone modifications can lead to gene\nsilencing, for example. The transgenerational hereditary properties of\nepigenetic markings may be subsequent to their regulatory function;\nhowever, in multicellular organisms, transgenerational heredity of\nepigenetic marks is constrained by their developmental role, since\nparental epigenetic markings may have to be reset in gametes so that\nthey can fulfill their developmental function anew in offspring (Shea\net al. 2011; see also Lachmann & Libby 2016).\n",
