    "main_text": "The Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t (Quatrains) || Doubt and Bewilderment\n3.4 Doubt and Bewilderment\nHumans, Khayyam tells us, are thrown into an existence they cannot make sense of:\n\nThe sphere upon which mortals come and go,\nHas no end nor beginning that we know;\nAnd none there is to tell us in plain truth:\nWhence do we come and whither do we go.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Whinfield 2001, 132)\n\nAgain, the vivid and apparent inconsistency between a seemingly senseless existence and a complex and orderly world leads to existential and philosophical doubt and bewilderment. The tension between Khayyam\u2019s philosophical writings in which he embraces the Islamic Peripatetic philosophical tradition and his Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t where he expresses his profound skepticism stems from this paradox. In his Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t Khayyam embraces, or comes very close to embracing, humanism and agnosticism, leaving the individual human being disoriented, anxious and bewildered; whereas in his philosophical writings he operates within a theistic world where the most fundamental questions, like the existence of God and explanation of evil, find (relatively) decisive solutions. Lack of certainty with regard to religious truth leaves the individual in an epistemologically suspended state where one has to live in the here and now, irrespective of the question of truth:\n\nSince neither truth nor certitude is at hand\nDo not waste your life in doubt for a fairyland\nO let us not refuse the goblet of wine\nFor, sober or drunken, in ignorance we stand\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (translation by Aminrazavi)\n\nThis skepticism towards organized religions runs deep in Khayyam\u2019s quatrains; he explicitly questions the orthodoxy and how the final disclosure of ultimate truth might be surprising to all \u201cbelievers,\u201d and perhaps \u201cnonbelievers\u201d (note: your reward is neither here nor there):\n\nAlike for those who for To-day prepare,\nAnd those that after a To-morrow stare,\nA Muezz\u00edn from the Tower of Darkness cries\n\u201cFools! your Reward is neither Here nor There!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, FitzGerald 2009, 28)\n\n",
