    "main_text": "\n\nMonroe Beardsley (1915\u20131985) was born and raised in Bridgeport,\nConnecticut, and educated at Yale University (B.A. 1936, Ph.D. 1939).\nHe taught at a number of colleges and universities, including Mt.\nHolyoke College and Yale University, but most of his career was spent\nat Swarthmore College (22 years) and Temple University (16 years).\n\nBeardsley is best known for his work in aesthetics\u2014and this\narticle will deal exclusively with his work in that area\u2014but he\nwas an extremely intellectually curious man, and published articles in\na number of areas, including the philosophy of history, action theory,\nand the history of modern philosophy. Indeed, his interests\nweren\u2019t confined to \u201cpure philosophy\u201d or even to\nphilosophy broadly conceived. Practical Logic, his first book\n(1950), was one of the first informal logic or critical thinking texts\nof the contemporary era, and Thinking Straight, (1950) a\nrelated book, saw four very different editions over a period of 25\nyears. Outside of philosophy, he wrote literary criticism and books\nand articles on style, writing, and the humanities. In short,\nBeardsley had broad humanistic interests that were centered in\nphilosophy, and aesthetics in particular.\n\nThree books and a number of articles form the core of\nBeardsley\u2019s work in aesthetics. Of the books, the first,\nAesthetics: Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism (1958;\nreissued with a postscript, 1981), is by far the most substantial,\ncomprehensive, and influential. More than that, it\u2019s also the\nfirst systematic, well-argued, and critically informed philosophy of\nart in the analytic tradition. Although not the main purpose of the\nbook, it showed that analytic philosophy and a keen interest in the\narts needn\u2019t exist in isolation but can, and should, inform each\nother. It\u2019s part of the book\u2019s achievement that\nthat\u2019s taken for granted today. It wasn\u2019t at the time it\nwas written, and many people, both in Anglo-American philosophical\ncircles and in art-critical circles, thought exactly the opposite in\nthe mid-1950s. Given the wide range of topics covered in\nAesthetics, the intelligent and philosophically informed\ntreatment accorded them, the historically unprecedented nature of the\nwork, and its effect on subsequent developments in the field, a number\nof philosophers, including some of Beardsley\u2019s critics, have\nargued that Aesthetics is the most impressive and important\nbook of twentieth century analytic aesthetics.\n\nThe Possibility of Criticism (1970), the second of the three\nbooks, is more modest in scope and less groundbreaking. Exclusively\nconcerned with literary criticism, it limits itself to four problems:\nthe \u201cself-sufficiency\u201d of a literary text, the nature of\nliterary interpretation, judging literary texts, and bad poetry. Views\npropounded and defended in Aesthetics are further explained\nand defended in The Possibility, and several new concepts,\nfor instance, that of an illocutionary act, are introduced and put to\nwork. As with all of Beardsley\u2019s writing, many poets, novelists,\nshort story writers, essayists, critics, and philosophers are quoted\nand discussed. The style, tone, and approach are also characteristic\nBeardsley: eminently clear and guileless prose, gentle in tone but\nfirm in argumentation.\n\nThe last of the books, The Aesthetic Point of View (1982), is\na collection of papers, most old, some new. The book takes its title\nfrom the lead article, but the title is also emblematic, indicating\nBeardsley\u2019s approach to the philosophy of art as a whole: the\nnecessity of taking the aesthetic point of view. Fourteen papers,\nlargely on the nature of the aesthetic and art criticism, are\nreprinted, and six new pieces are added. The new pieces are of special\ninterest because they constitute Beardsley\u2019s final word on the\ntopics covered, and the topics are themselves central ones: aesthetic\nexperience, the definition of art, judgments of value, reasons in art\ncriticism, artists\u2019 intentions and interpretation, and art and\nculture.\n",
