    "main_text": "Opinion, Conviction, Belief\n11. Opinion, Conviction, Belief\n\nMarcel draws a sharp distinction between opinion and belief. Opinion\nalways concerns that which we do not know, that with which we are not\nfamiliar. It exists in a position between impression and affirmation.\nIt is often the case that opinions have a \u201cfalse\u201d basis,\nwhich is most clear in case of stereotypes and prejudices\n(\u201ceverybody knows that\u2026\u201d). Furthermore, opinions\nare invariably \u201cexternal\u201d to the things to which they\nrefer. I have an opinion about something only when I disengage myself\nfrom it and hold it at \u201carm\u2019s length.\u201d Nevertheless,\nwe hold or maintain these opinions in front of others, and given the\nelusive foundations on which these opinions are based, it is easy to\nsee how an opinion slides slowly from an impression we have to a claim\nthat we make. This transition invariably takes place as part of an\nabsence of reflection on the given subject and the entrenchment of the\nopinion due to repetition. Our opinions are often\n\u201cunshakable\u201d precisely because of the lack of reflection\nassociated with them.\n\nWhile opinions are unreflective and external, convictions\u2014which\nare more akin to belief than opinion\u2014are the result of extensive\nreflection and invariably concern things to which one feels closely\ntied. Like opinions that have entrenched themselves to the point of\nbecoming actual claims, convictions are felt to be definitive, beyond\nmodification. However, when I claim that nothing can change my\nconviction, I must either affirm that I have already anticipated all\npossible future scenarios and no possible event can change my\nconviction, or affirm that whatever events do occur\u2014anticipated\nor unanticipated\u2014they will not shake my conviction. The first\npossibility is impossible. The second possibility is based on a\ndecision, a decision to remain constant whatever may come. However,\nupon reflection such a decision seems as over-confidant as the claim\nto have anticipated the future. By what right can I affirm that my\ninner conviction will not change in any circumstance? To do so is to\nimply that, in the future, I will cease to reflect on my conviction.\nIt seems that all I am able to say is that my conviction is such that,\nat the present moment, I cannot imagine an alteration in it.\n\nBelief is akin to conviction; it is, however, distinguished by its\nobject. Marcel insists in many places that proper use of the term\n\u201cbelief\u201d applies not to things \u201cthat\u201d we\nbelieve, but to things \u201cin which\u201d we believe. Belief is\nnot \u201cbelief that\u2026\u201d but is \u201cbelief\nin\u2026\u201d Belief that might be better characterized\nas a conviction rather than a belief; however, to believe in\nsomething is to extend credit to it, to place something at the\ndisposal of that in which we believe. The notion of credit placed at\nthe disposal of the other is another way of speaking about\ndisponibilit\u00e9. \u201cI am in no way separable from\nthat which I place at the disposal of this X\u2026\nActually, the credit I extend is, in a way, myself. I lend myself to\nX. We should note at once that this is an essentially\nmysterious act\u201d (Marcel 1951a, p. 134). This is what\ndistinguishes conviction from belief. Conviction refers to the\nX, takes a position with regard to X, but does not\nbind itself to X. While I have an opinion, I\nam a belief\u2014for belief changes the way I am in the\nworld, changes my being. We can now see how belief refers to the\nother, and how it is connected to disponibilit\u00e9:\nbelief always applies to \u201cpersonal or supra-personal\nreality\u201d (Marcel 1951a, p. 135). It always involves a thou to\nwhom I extend credit\u2014a credit that puts myself at the disposal\nof the thou\u2014and thus arises the problem of\n fidelity.[12]\n",
