Platonism is\nthe view that (a) there exist abstract mathematical objects (i.e.,\nnonspatiotemporal mathematical objects), and (b) our mathematical\nsentences and theories provide true descriptions of such objects. So,\nfor instance, on the platonist view, the sentence \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 provides a straightforward description of a certain\nobject\u2014namely, the number 3\u2014in much the same way that the\nsentence \u2018Mars is red\u2019 provides a description of Mars. But\nwhereas Mars is a physical object, the number 3 is (according to\nplatonism) an abstract object. And abstract objects,\nplatonists tell us, are wholly nonphysical, nonmental, nonspatial,\nnontemporal, and noncausal. Thus, on this view, the number 3 exists\nindependently of us and our thinking, but it does not exist in space\nor time, it is not a physical or mental object, and it does not enter\ninto causal relations with other objects. This view has been endorsed\nby Plato, Frege (1884, 1893\u20131903, 1919), G\u00f6del (1964), and\nin some of their writings, Russell (1912) and Quine (1948, 1951), not\nto mention numerous more recent philosophers of mathematics, e.g.,\nPutnam (1971), Parsons (1971), Steiner (1975), Resnik (1997), Shapiro\n(1997), Hale (1987), Wright (1983), Katz (1998), Zalta (1988), Colyvan\n(2001), McEvoy (2012), and Marcus (2015).\n\nFictionalism, on the other hand, is the view that (a) our mathematical\nsentences and theories do purport to be about abstract mathematical\nobjects, as platonism suggests, but (b) there are no such things as\nabstract objects, and so (c) our mathematical theories are not true.\nThus, the idea is that sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 are\nfalse, or untrue, for the same reason that, say, \u2018The tooth\nfairy is generous\u2019 is false or untrue\u2014because just as\nthere is no such person as the tooth fairy, so too there is no such\nthing as the number 3. It is important to note, however, that despite\nthe name, fictionalist views do not have to involve any very strong\nclaims about the analogy between mathematics and fiction. For\ninstance, there is no claim here that mathematical discourse is a kind\nof fictional discourse. Thus, fictionalists are not committed to the\nthesis that there are no important disanalogies between mathematics\nand fiction. (We will return to this issue below, in section 2.4.)\nFinally, it should also be noted at the start that fictionalism is a\nversion of mathematical nominalism, the view that there are\nno such things as mathematical objects.\n\nFictionalism was first introduced by Field (1980, 1989, 1998, 2016).\nSince then, the view has been developed\u2014in a few different\nways\u2014by Balaguer (1996a, 1998a, 2001, 2009), Rosen (2001), Yablo\n(2002a, 2002b, 2005), Leng (2005a, 2005b, 2010), and Bueno (2009),\nthough as will become clear below, one might question whether Bueno\nand Yablo are best interpreted as fictionalists. Others to endorse or\ndefend fictionalism (or views in the neighborhood of fictionalism)\ninclude Daly (2006), Liggins (2010), Contessa (2016), and Plebani\n(2018). Finally, one might also interpret Melia (2000) as defending a\nfictionalist view, though he doesn\u2019t really commit to this.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Hoffman (2004) also endorses a view that\nis a kind of fictionalism. Her view is very different from the\nfictionalist view defined above, however, because it doesn\u2019t\ninvolve a commitment to thesis (a). She reinterprets mathematics along\nthe lines of Kitcher (1984) and then endorses a fictionalist view of\nthis reinterpretation; i.e., she maintains that once mathematics is\nreinterpreted in this way, it\u2019s singular terms fail to refer and\nits sentences are not true. (It\u2019s not clear how much this view\ndiffers from Kitcher\u2019s view; one might interpret Kitcher as\nendorsing a very similar view.) In any event, it is important to note\nthat Hoffman\u2019s rejection of thesis (a) makes her view radically\ndifferent from more standard fictionalist views. As will become clear\nbelow, thesis (a) is very plausible, and its plausibility is one of\nthe main reasons for the popularity of platonism. Thus, one of the\nmain selling points of fictionalism\u2014i.e., the standard sort of\nfictionalism defined above\u2014is that it combines an acceptance of\nthesis (a) with an anti-platonistic ontology.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Lear (1982) and Corkum (2012) argue\nthat Aristotle held a version of mathematical fictionalism; but as\nCorkum notes, it\u2019s unlikely that Aristotle held the version of\nfictionalism defined above. \n\nWhen one first hears the fictionalist hypothesis, it can seem a bit\ncrazy. Are we really supposed to believe that sentences like \u20183\nis prime\u2019 and \u20182 + 2 = 4\u2019 are false? But\nthe appeal of fictionalism starts to emerge when we realize what the\nalternatives are. By thinking carefully about the issues surrounding\nthe interpretation of mathematical discourse, it can start to seem\nthat fictionalism is actually very plausible, and indeed, that it\nmight just be the least crazy view out there.\n\nSection 1 provides a formulation of what might be thought of as the\ncentral argument for fictionalism. Section 2 provides a discussion of\na number of different objections to fictionalism, as well as a number\nof different versions of fictionalism. These two things go\ntogether very naturally, because the different versions of\nfictionalism have emerged in connection with the responses that\ndifferent philosophers have given to the various objections to\nfictionalism.\n", "toc": [{"#ArgForFic": "1.

The Argument For Fictionalism\n1.1 The Main Argument\n\nThe main argument for fictionalism proceeds essentially by trying to\neliminate all of the alternatives to fictionalism. The argument can be\nput like this:\n\nMathematical sentences like \u20184 is even\u2019 should be read\nat face value; that is, they should be read as being of the form\n\u2018Fa\u2019 and, hence, as making\nstraightforward claims about the nature of certain objects; e.g.,\n\u20184 is even\u2019 should be read as making a straightforward\nclaim about the nature of the number 4. But\nIf sentences like \u20184 is even\u2019 should be read at face\nvalue, and if moreover they are true, then there must actually exist\nobjects of the kinds that they\u2019re about; for instance, if\n\u20184 is even\u2019 makes a straightforward claim about the nature\nof the number 4, and if this sentence is literally true, then there\nmust actually exist such a thing as the number 4. Therefore, from (1)\nand (2), it follows that\nIf sentences like \u20184 is even\u2019 are true, then there are\nsuch things as mathematical objects. But\nIf there are such things as mathematical objects, then they are\nabstract objects, i.e., nonspatiotemporal objects; for instance, if\nthere is such a thing as the number 4, then it is an abstract object,\nnot a physical or mental object. But\nThere are no such things as abstract objects. Therefore, from (4)\nand (5) by modus tollens, it follows that\nThere are no such things as mathematical objects. And so, from (3)\nand (6) by modus tollens, it follows that\nSentences like \u20184 is even\u2019 are not true (indeed,\nthey\u2019re not true for the reason that fictionalists give, and so\nit follows that fictionalism is true).\n\n\nThe three inferences in this argument are all pretty clearly valid,\nand so the only question is whether the four basic premises\u2014(1),\n(2), (4), and (5)\u2014are true. And the nice thing about the way\nthis argument is set up is that each of these premises is supposed to\nget rid of a different alternative to fictionalism. So the argument in\n(1)\u2013(7) is actually a shell of a much longer argument that includes\nsubarguments in favor of the basic premises and, hence, against the\nvarious alternatives to fictionalism.\n\nGiven this, we can say that there are five alternatives (or if\nyou\u2019d rather, five categories of alternatives) to\nfictionalism. Those who reject (1) can be called paraphrase\nnominalists; those who reject (2) can be called\ndeflationary-truth nominalists; those who reject (4) are\neither physicalists or psychologists; and those who\nreject (5) are platonists. In order to motivate their view,\nfictionalists need to provide arguments against all of these\nviews.\n\nThe easiest part of the fictionalist\u2019s job here is arguing\nagainst the various anti-platonist views. All of these\nviews\u2014paraphrase nominalism, deflationary-truth nominalism,\nphysicalism, and psychologism\u2014can be understood (as fictionalism\ncan) as reactions to platonism. Platonism is a very attractive view\nbecause it provides an extremely natural and pleasing account of\nmathematical practice and mathematical discourse. But despite this,\nmany philosophers do not endorse platonism because they cannot bring\nthemselves to accept its ontology. In other words, they simply\ndon\u2019t believe that there are any such things as abstract\nobjects. Because of this, much of the work that\u2019s been done in\nthe philosophy of mathematics has been dedicated to attempts to avoid\nplatonism. In particular, paraphrase nominalism, deflationary-truth\nnominalism, physicalism, and psychologism can all be understood in\nthese terms. They all attempt to undermine the platonistic view of the\ntruth conditions of mathematical sentences. But as will become clear\nbelow, there are serious problem with all of these views. And this is\nwhere fictionalism comes in: it grants the platonistic view of the\ntruth conditions of mathematical sentences but still denies the\nplatonist\u2019s ontological thesis that there exist abstract\nobjects. This makes fictionalism different from other anti-platonist\nviews in an important way. We can appreciate this by noting that\nplatonism involves two different theses, one semantic and the other\nontological. The semantic thesis is an empirical hypothesis about the\ntruth conditions of ordinary mathematical utterances, and the\nontological thesis is a deeply metaphysical hypothesis about the\nexistence of abstract objects. Every version of anti-platonism rejects\nthe platonist\u2019s ontological hypothesis, and all of the\nnon-fictionalistic versions of anti-platonism reject the semantic\nthesis as well. Fictionalism is the only anti-platonistic view that\ndoesn\u2019t reject the semantic thesis. And this is why fictionalism\ncan seem more attractive than the other versions of\nanti-platonism\u2014because the platonist\u2019s semantic hypothesis\nis extremely plausible and well-motivated. Thus, the versions of\nanti-platonism that reject this hypothesis can seem implausible and\nunmotivated.\n\nSo, again, the easy part of the argument for fictionalism (or at any\nrate, the easier part) is carried out by providing arguments\nfor premises (1), (2), and (4)\u2014or equivalently, by providing\narguments against the various non-fictionalistic versions of\nanti-platonism, i.e., paraphrase nominalism, deflationary-truth\nnominalism, physicalism, and psychologism. The next three subsections\n(1.2\u20131.4) discuss these four views as well as some arguments\nthat fictionalists might mount against them. Section 1.5 covers the\nmore difficult part of the fictionalist\u2019s argument\u2014i.e.,\npremise (5) and the question of how fictionalists might argue against\nplatonism.\n1.2 Premise (1) and Paraphrase Nominalism\n\nParaphrase nominalism is the view that ordinary mathematical sentences\nlike \u20183 is prime\u2019 should not be read at face\nvalue\u2014or more specifically, that they should not be read as\nbeing of the form \u2018Fa\u2019 and making claims\nabout mathematical objects. There are a few different versions of this\nview. Perhaps the most famous is if-thenism. On this view,\n\u20183 is prime\u2019 is best interpreted as expressing a\nconditional claim, such as \u2018If there were numbers, then 3 would\nbe prime\u2019, or perhaps \u2018Necessarily, if there are numbers,\nthen 3 is prime.\u2019 (Versions of if-thenism have been developed by\nPutnam (1967a,b), Horgan (1984), Hellman (1989), Dorr (2008), and\nYablo (2017); moreover, a precursor to this view was endorsed by the\nearly Hilbert (see his 1899 and his letters to Frege in Frege 1980).\nFinally, other versions of paraphrase nominalism have been endorsed by\nChihara (1990), Yi (2002), Hofweber (2005), Rayo (2008, 2013), and\nMoltmann (2013); and one might also interpret Curry (1951) and\nWittgenstein (1956) in this way.) \n\nThe problem with paraphrase nominalist views is very simple: they\ninvolve empirical hypotheses about the meanings of ordinary\nmathematical utterances that are extremely implausible. For instance,\nin connection with if-thenism, it\u2019s just really hard to believe\nthat the best interpretation of what ordinary speakers of mathematical\ndiscourse (ordinary mathematicians and ordinary folk) are saying when\nthey utter, e.g., \u20183 is prime\u2019 is that if there were\nnumbers then 3 would be prime. This just seems to get wrong what\npeople actually mean when they utter sentences like this. Indeed, it\nseems that a more general point can be made here. There is a good\ninterpretive principle that says something like this: we should\ninterpret people\u2019s utterances at face value unless there\u2019s\nevidence that they have positive intentions to be interpreted\nnonliterally. Given this, and given (what seems obvious) that ordinary\npeople don\u2019t have positive intentions for their mathematical\nutterances to be interpreted nonliterally\u2014e.g., as expressing\nconditional propositions\u2014it seems to follow that we ought to\ninterpret our mathematical utterances at face value. But this means\nthat we ought to accept premise (1) and reject paraphrase\nnominalism.\n\nParaphrase nominalists might try to respond to this argument by\ndenying that they are committed to the thesis that their paraphrases\nfit with the intentions of ordinary mathematicians and ordinary folk.\nIndeed, claims of this sort have been made by both Chihara (1990,\n2004) and Hellman (1998). But paraphrase nominalists cannot endorse\nthis stance, for if they do, their view will collapse into a version\nof fictionalism. If paraphrase nominalists admit that platonists and\nfictionalists are right about the meanings of real\nmathematical utterances\u2014i.e., the utterances of actual\nmathematicians\u2014then (since they also want to maintain that there\nare no such things as abstract objects) they will be committed to the\nclaim that the utterances of actual mathematicians are untrue. Thus,\nif paraphrase nominalists don\u2019t claim that their paraphrases\ncapture the actual meanings of ordinary mathematical sentences, then\ntheir view won\u2019t provide a genuine alternative to fictionalism.\nIt will collapse into a version of fictionalism. More specifically, a\nparaphrase nominalist would just be a fictionalist who thinks that we\nought to alter our mathematical language, or what we mean by\nour mathematical utterances; or perhaps the claim would simply be that\nwe could alter our mathematical language if we wanted to and\nthat this fact provides fictionalists with a way of responding to\ncertain objections.\n1.3 Premise (2) and Deflationary-Truth Nominalism\n\nDeflationary-truth nominalism is the view that (a) as platonists and\nfictionalists maintain, ordinary mathematical sentences like \u20183\nis prime\u2019 should be read at face value, i.e., as being of the\nform \u2018Fa\u2019 and hence as making claims\nabout mathematical objects, and (b) there are no such things as\nmathematical objects, but (c) our mathematical sentences are still\ntrue. Views of this kind have been endorsed by Azzouni (1994, 2004,\n2010) and Bueno (2005, 2009). It should be noted, however, that\nBueno\u2014in his (2009)\u2014calls his version of\ndeflationary-truth nominalism a version of fictionalism. This\nisn\u2019t because he really endorses the view that\u2019s being\ncalled fictionalism in this essay; it\u2019s because he uses the term\n\u2018fictionalism\u2019 differently from the way in which\nit\u2019s being used in this essay. But it\u2019s important to note\nthat Bueno\u2019s usage isn\u2019t that different; for as\nwe are about to see, deflationary-truth nominalism and fictionalism\n(as it\u2019s being defined here) are fairly similar views.\n(Bueno\u2019s view also differs from the fictionalist view defined\nhere in a second way: he endorses agnosticism about abstract\nobjects rather than full-blown anti-realism. But this difference is\neven less important than the first one; if we rephrased (b) and (c) in\nthe above definition of fictionalism so that they were consistent with\nagnosticism, virtually nothing else about the fictionalist view would\nhave to change. So fictionalists can choose whether they want to be\nagnostic or anti-realist about abstract objects, and this decision\nwon\u2019t have a very big impact on the rest of their view. Indeed,\nas will become clear in section 3, Bueno\u2019s agnosticism might be\nmore or less equivalent to the views of certain fictionalists.)\n\nBefore describing the problems with deflationary-truth nominalism,\nit\u2019s important to note that the central claim behind that view\nis an empirical hypothesis about ordinary discourse. In particular,\nit\u2019s a claim about the meaning of the term \u2018true\u2019,\nor about the concept of truth. When deflationary-truth nominalists say\nthat, e.g., \u20183 is prime\u2019 could be true even if there were\nno such thing as the number 3, they are making a claim about the\nordinary concept of truth. They are saying that that concept applies\nin certain situations that most of us\u2014platonists and\nfictionalists and just about everyone else\u2014think it\ndoesn\u2019t apply in. If deflationary-truth nominalists try\nto deny that they are making a claim about the ordinary\nconcept of truth, then their view will collapse into a version of\nfictionalism. For since they agree with fictionalists that \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 purports to be about a certain abstract object, and since\nthey also agree that there are no such things as abstract objects, it\nfollows that if they endorsed a standard view of truth\u2014i.e., a\nplatonist-fictionalist view according to which a sentence of the form\n\u2018Fa\u2019 could not be true unless\n\u2018a\u2019 referred to an actually existing\nobject\u2014then they would have to admit that \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 is untrue. Now, they might go on to argue that these\nsentences are true*\u2014where this is defined in such a way\nthat sentences of the form \u2018Fa\u2019 can be\ntrue* even if there is no such thing as a\u2014but, of\ncourse, fictionalists would agree with this. So if\ndeflationary-truth nominalism is to be genuinely distinct from\nfictionalism, it has to involve a thesis about the meaning of the\nordinary word \u2018true\u2019; in particular, the claim has to be\nthat sentences of the form \u2018Fa\u2019 can be\ntrue, in the ordinary sense of the term, even if the singular\nterm \u2018a\u2019 doesn\u2019t refer to any actually\nexisting object.\n\nGiven this, most fictionalists would probably say that the problem\nwith deflationary-truth nominalism is that it\u2019s empirically\nimplausible. In other words, the objection would be that\ndeflationary-truth nominalism flies badly in the face of our\nintuitions about the meaning of \u2018true\u2019. And there does\nseem to be some justification for this claim. For instance, it just\nseems intuitively obvious that the sentence \u2018Mars is a\nplanet\u2019 could not be literally true unless there really existed\nsuch a thing as Mars. Moreover, intuitively, the sentence \u2018Mars\nis a planet, but it doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 seems like a\ncontradiction, and this intuition seems to be incompatible with\ndeflationary-truth nominalism. If this is right\u2014if the\ndeflationary-truth semantic thesis runs counter to our semantic\nintuitions\u2014then this provides strong evidence for thinking\nit\u2019s false.\n\nBut there is also a second problem with deflationary-truth nominalism:\nit\u2019s supposed to provide us with a way of avoiding platonism,\nbut in fact, it doesn\u2019t. Prima facie, it might seem\nthat deflationary-truth nominalism does deliver a way of avoiding\nplatonism, because the argument for platonism might seem to rely upon\npremise (2) above\u2014i.e., it might seem to rely upon the\nanti-deflationary-truth claim that if sentences like \u20184 is\neven\u2019 should be read at face value, i.e., as being of the form\n\u2018Fa\u2019, and if these sentence are\nliterally true, then we are committed to believing in the objects that\nthey\u2019re about, e.g., the number 4. But, in fact, platonists can\nformulate their argument so that it doesn\u2019t rely upon this\nanti-deflationary-truth premise. To bring this point out, let\u2019s\nbegin by introducing two new terms of\nart\u2014\u2018true1\u2019 and\n\u2018true2\u2019\u2014and stipulating that\n\u2018true1\u2019 is to be taken as expressing the\nplatonist-fictionalist concept of truth, so that a sentence of the\nform \u2018Fa\u2019 cannot be true1\nunless \u2018a\u2019 refers to an actually existing object,\nwhereas \u2018true2\u2019 expresses a deflationary\nconcept of truth, so that a sentence of the form\n\u2018Fa\u2019 can be true2 even if\n\u2018a\u2019 doesn\u2019t refer to any actually existing\nobject. Given this, platonists can say the following: \n\nWe just don\u2019t care whether the word \u2018true\u2019, as\nit\u2019s used in ordinary English, expresses truth1 or\ntruth2 (or whether it\u2019s ambiguous and sometimes\nexpresses the one concept and sometimes the other). We acknowledge\nthat standard formulations of the argument for platonism involve\nclaims to the effect that ordinary mathematical sentences like\n\u20183 is prime\u2019 are true. But we could just as\neasily base our argument on the claim that sentences like this are\ntrue1. In doing this, we wouldn\u2019t weaken our argument\nin any way. For the arguments we use to motivate the truth of\nmathematics\u2014most notably, the Quine-Putnam indispensability\nargument discussed below\u2014are already arguments for the\ntruth1 of mathematics. And this shouldn\u2019t be\nsurprising; for when we say that ordinary mathematical\nsentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 are true, what we\nmean is that they\u2019re true1; so, of course,\nthe arguments that we give for the truth of mathematics are already\nsupposed to be arguments for the truth1 of mathematics.\n\n\nGiven that platonists can proceed in this way, it seems that the\nquestion of whether the deflationary-truth semantic thesis is\nright\u2014i.e., the question of whether the English word\n\u2018true\u2019 expresses the concept of truth1 or\ntruth2\u2014is simply a red herring. The real question is\nwhether platonists have any good arguments for the truth1\nof mathematics (and, of course, whether anti-platonists have any good\narguments against the truth1 of mathematics). In\nother words, if we assume that premises (1) and (4) are true, so that\nwe have to read our mathematical claims as being about (or at least\npurporting to be about) abstract objects, then the real question is\nwhether there are any good reasons for choosing between platonism and\nfictionalism.\n1.4 Premise (4) and Physicalism and Psychologism\n\nPhysicalism is the view that our mathematical sentences and theories\nare about ordinary physical objects. John Stuart Mill (1843) developed\na view of this kind. On his view, mathematics is just a very general\nnatural science. Thus, for instance, according to Mill, the sentence\n\u20182 + 3 = 5\u2019 is not a claim about abstract objects (the\nnumbers 2, 3, and 5); rather, it\u2019s a claim about piles of\nphysical objects (in particular, it tells us that if we push a pile of\ntwo objects together with a pile of three objects, we\u2019ll get a\npile of five objects. (Phillip Kitcher (1984) and the early Penelope\nMaddy (1990) have also endorsed views with \u201cphysicalistic\nleanings\u201d, but in the end, neither is plausibly interpreted as\nfalling into this camp. Maddy\u2019s early view is better thought of\nas a non-traditional sort of platonism, because according to this\nview, mathematics is about nonphysical objects that exist in space and\ntime; and Kitcher\u2019s view is best thought of as a kind of\nparaphrase nominalism, because on his view, mathematical utterances\nturn out not to be about any actually existing objects.)\n\nThere are numerous problems with physicalistic views of mathematics.\nTo mention just one of these problems, physicalism seems completely\nincapable of accounting for various kinds of claims about infinities\nthat we find in mathematics. For instance, it is a theorem of set\ntheory that there are infinitely many transfinite cardinal numbers\nthat keep getting bigger and bigger without end. Thus, set theory is\ncommitted to the existence of infinite sets that are so huge that they\nsimply dwarf garden variety infinite sets, like the set of all the\nnatural numbers. There is just no plausible way to interpret this talk\nof gigantic infinite sets as being about physical objects.\n\nPsychologism is the view that mathematical sentences and theories are\nabout mental objects. Probably the most common version of this view\nholds that numbers are something like ideas in our heads, and ordinary\nmathematical sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 provide\ndescriptions of these ideas. This view was popular in the late\n19th Century; it was endorsed by, e.g., the early Husserl\n(1891), as well as the intuitionists, Brouwer (1912, 1948) and Heyting\n(1956). But Frege (1884, 1893\u20131903) provided a host of arguments\nagainst the view and essentially buried it. To give just one argument\nhere, it seems that psychologism is just as incapable as physicalism\nis of dealing with the huge infinities in mathematics. As was just\nseen, standard set theories entail that there actually exist huge\ninfinities of mathematical objects. But it\u2019s just not believable\nthat there are that many ideas in our heads. Indeed, it seems clear\nthat there are only finitely many ideas in our heads. Therefore, it is\nnot plausible to maintain that the claims of set theory are made true\nby mental objects.\n\nIn response, one might claim that even if there aren\u2019t\ninfinitely many ideas in our heads, it seems likely that we have ideas\nof infinities in our heads. This is no doubt true\u2014there are such\nideas in our heads\u2014but this does not save psychologism from the\nabove objection. For our mathematical theories entail that there\nactually exist infinitely many different mathematical objects. E.g.,\nstandard theories of arithmetic entail that there is such a thing as\n1, and that there is such a thing as 2 (and that it\u2019s distinct\nfrom 1), and that there is such a thing as 3 (and that it\u2019s\ndistinct from both 1 and 2), and so on. So our mathematical theories\nare true descriptions of ideas in our heads only if there actually\nexist infinitely many different ideas in our heads. Thus, since there\naren\u2019t that many ideas in our heads, we cannot maintain that our\nmathematical theories are true descriptions of such things.\n\nAlternatively, one might respond to the above argument against\npsychologism by moving to a view according to which mathematical\nclaims are about ideas that we could construct, or\npossible mental objects, or some such thing. But this would\nnot be a psychologistic view, because on this view, the objects of\nmathematics would not be actual mental objects; they would be\npossible objects, which, presumably, are either abstract\nobjects or objects of some other metaphysically dubious kind.\n\nFinally, one might object to both of the arguments in this\nsubsection\u2014i.e., the arguments against physicalism and\npsychologism\u2014by saying something like this:\n\nThe arguments given here are supposed to motivate the idea that\nordinary mathematical sentences like \u20184 is even\u2019 are not\nplausibly interpreted as being about physical or mental\nobjects\u2014or more specifically, that they are better interpreted\nas being about (or at least purporting to be about) abstract objects.\nBut one might object here that, as an interpretation of ordinary\nmathematical discourse, the platonist/fictionalist view is no more\nplausible than physicalism or psychologism. For one might find it\nimplausible to suppose that when ordinary folk make mathematical\nclaims, they intend to be speaking about abstract objects.\n\nBut platonists and fictionalists are not committed to the thesis that\npeople have positive intentions to be talking about abstract objects.\nRather, they can say the following: (i) ordinary mathematical claims\nare best interpreted at face value\u2014and, hence, as making claims\nabout objects\u2014because typical mathematicians (and, indeed,\ntypical examples of ordinary folk) do not have positive intentions to\nbe speaking nonliterally when they utter mathematical sentences; and\n(ii) there are features of the intentions of typical mathematicians\nand typical folk, with respect to their mathematical utterances, that\nare inconsistent with the idea that these utterances are about\nphysical or mental objects; and (iii) there is nothing in the\nintentions of typical mathematicians or typical folk that is\ninconsistent with the idea that our mathematical sentences are about\nabstract objects. Thus, on this view, the platonist/fictionalist\nsemantic theory is better than other semantic theories of mathematical\ndiscourse because it\u2019s the only theory that\u2019s consistent\nwith the data\u2014not because mathematicians and ordinary folk have\npositive intentions to be speaking about abstract objects when they\nutter mathematical sentences.\n\n(It\u2019s worth noting, before moving on, that one can claim that\nthe existence of mathematical objects like numbers is dependent on\nus without endorsing a psychologistic view of these objects. For\none might claim that numbers are mind-dependent abstract\nobjects\u2014i.e., non-spatiotemporal objects that came into being\nbecause of the activities of human beings. Views of this general kind\nare endorsed by Liston (2003\u201304), Cole (2009), and Bueno\n(2009).) \n1.5 Premise (5) and Platonism\n\nIf the arguments given so far are correct, then the only remaining\nviews\u2014the only philosophies of mathematics that haven\u2019t\nbeen ruled out\u2014are platonism and fictionalism. Thus, to complete\ntheir argument, fictionalists need merely to provide an argument for\npremise (5); in other words, they just need to argue against\nplatonism. But this turns out to be a lot harder than arguing against\nthe various non-fictionalistic versions of anti-platonism considered\nabove. As we\u2019ve seen, fictionalists can argue against those\nviews by simply motivating a series of empirical hypotheses about\nordinary mathematical discourse and the ordinary meaning of the word\n\u2018true\u2019. More specifically, fictionalists can argue against\nthese views by arguing that (a) ordinary mathematical utterances are\nbest interpreted at face value, and (b) these utterances cannot\nplausibly be interpreted as being about physical or mental objects,\nand (c) sentences of the form \u2018The object a is an\nF\u2019 cannot be true, in the ordinary sense of the term,\nunless there really is such a thing as a. But fictionalists\ncannot argue against platonism in anything like this way, because\nfictionalists and platonists are in agreement about the meanings of\nordinary mathematical utterances (and the word \u2018true\u2019).\nIndeed, platonists and fictionalists don\u2019t disagree about\nany semantic theses. Their disagreement is about an\nontological thesis: platonists believe in abstract objects,\nwhereas fictionalists do not. Thus, if fictionalists are going to\nargue against platonism, they\u2019re going to have to use a\ndifferent kind of argument.\n\nThere are a few different arguments that have been brought against\nmathematical platonism, but the most important\u2014and the most\nfamous\u2014is what is known as the epistemological argument\nagainst platonism. This argument goes back at least to Plato. In\ncontemporary times, it received its most classical statement in a\npaper by Paul Benacerraf (1973), although most philosophers of\nmathematics agree that Benacerraf\u2019s formulation of the argument\nis problematic because of its reliance on an implausible causal theory\nof knowledge. A better way to formulate the argument is as\nfollows:\n\nHuman beings exist entirely within spacetime.\nIf there exist any abstract mathematical objects, then they exist\noutside of spacetime. Therefore, it seems likely that\nIf there exist any abstract mathematical objects, then human\nbeings could not attain knowledge of them. But\nIt\u2019s built into the platonistic view that there do exist\nabstract objects and that human beings can acquire knowledge of them\n(after all, according to platonism, mathematical knowledge just\nis knowledge of abstract objects). Therefore,\nPlatonism is false.\n\n\nPlatonists have tried to respond to this argument in a few different\nways, but the most popular (and, it can be argued, the most plausible)\nresponse is to try to undermine the inference from (i) and (ii) to\n(iii) by explaining how (iii) could be false even if (i) and (ii) are\ntrue\u2014i.e., how human beings could acquire knowledge of abstract\nobjects despite the fact that they are causally isolated from such\nobjects and, hence, do not have any information-transferring\ncontact with such objects. This strategy of response has been\npursued by Quine (1948, 1951), Steiner (1975), Katz (1981, 1998),\nResnik (1982, 1997), Shapiro (1989, 1997), Lewis (1986), Linsky and\nZalta (1995), Balaguer (1995, 1998a), and Linnebo (2006). The question\nof whether any of these responses succeeds is extremely controversial\namong philosophers of mathematics. Moreover, anti-platonists do not\nhave any compelling argument for the thesis that platonists\ncouldn\u2019t provide the required explanation\nhere\u2014i.e., that they couldn\u2019t explain how human beings\ncould acquire knowledge of abstract objects without the aid of any\ninformation-transferring contact with such objects. Thus, to make a\nvery long story short, it seems fair to say that the epistemological\nargument against platonism is, at best, controversial and\ninconclusive.\n\n(For a more complete discussion of the epistemological argument\nagainst platonism, including discussions of the various responses that\nplatonists have attempted, see the Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy entry entitled \u201cPlatonism in\nMetaphysics\u201d.)\n\nGiven that the epistemological argument does not succeed in refuting\nplatonism, fictionalists might attempt to provide some other argument\nagainst platonism. One such argument that has received considerable\nattention is the multiple-reductions argument. The classical\nstatement of this argument is given, once again, by Benacerraf (1965).\nThe argument can be run in connection with any of our mathematical\ntheories, but the point is usually made in connection with arithmetic.\nMoreover, even when we zero in on arithmetic, there are still many\ndifferent ways to formulate the argument. One way to do this is as\nfollows: (A) if there are any sequences of abstract objects that\nsatisfy our arithmetical theories, then there are infinitely many, and\nthere is nothing \u201cmetaphysically special\u201d about any of\nthese sequences that makes it stand out as the sequence of\nnatural numbers; but (B) platonism is committed to the thesis that\nthere is a unique sequence of abstract objects that is the natural\nnumbers. Therefore, (C) platonism is false.\n\nPlatonists have offered numerous responses to this argument. Probably\nthe most common strategy has been to reject (A), i.e., to argue that\nplatonists can in fact defend the claim that there is a unique\nsequence that stands out as the sequence of natural numbers.\nThis strategy has been pursued in different ways by, e.g., Resnik\n(1997), Shapiro (1997), Parsons (1990), and Linsky and Zalta (1995).\nMoreover, Balaguer (1998a) argues that even if (A) is true, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter, because (B) is false: platonists can simply\nadmit that there are numerous sequences that satisfy our arithmetical\ntheories and that it may be that none of them stands out as the one\nand only sequence of natural numbers. There is no widespread agreement\non the status of these platonistic responses, and so, as is the case\nwith the epistemological argument, it would be extremely\ncontroversial, if not downright implausible, to claim that the\nmultiple-reductions argument refutes platonism.\n\nAside from this, the only argument against platonism that has received\nmuch attention in the philosophy of mathematics is an\nOckham\u2019s-razor-based argument. We will return to this argument\n(very briefly) in section 3; for now, we can simply note that, like\nthe epistemological argument and the multiple-reductions argument, the\nOckham\u2019s-razor-based argument is very controversial, and the\nclaim that this argument refutes platonism is (at the very least)\ntendentious. Thus, the overall conclusion that we seem led to here is\nthis: even if fictionalists can motivate the platonist/fictionalist\nsemantics of mathematical discourse and, thus, eliminate all of the\nanti-platonistic alternatives to fictionalism, they do not have any\nreally compelling argument against platonism, or for the conclusion\nthat fictionalism is superior to platonism. In other words,\nfictionalists don\u2019t have any compelling argument for premise\n(5), and so the positive argument for their view is, at best,\nincomplete.\n2. Objections to Fictionalism and Responses\n\nGiven that there are no compelling arguments against platonism, the\nnext question one might naturally ask is whether there are any good\narguments against fictionalism (and hence, if platonism is really the\nonly plausible alternative to fictionalism, in favor of platonism).\nThe present section considers several such arguments. In going through\nthe fictionalist responses to these arguments, we will also see how\ndifferent philosophers have developed different versions of\nfictionalism.\n2.1 The Indispensability Argument\n\nBy far the most important and widely discussed argument against\nfictionalism is what\u2019s known as the Quine-Putnam\nindispensability argument (see, e.g., Quine (1948, 1951), Putnam\n(1971), Resnik (1997), and Colyvan (2001)). This argument has been\nformulated in a number of different ways. One very simple version of\nthe argument can be put like this: (i) mathematical sentences form an\nindispensable part of our empirical theories of the physical\nworld\u2014i.e., our theories of physics, chemistry, and so on; (ii)\nwe have good reasons for thinking that these empirical theories are\ntrue, i.e., that they give us accurate pictures of the world;\ntherefore, (iii) we have good reasons to think that our mathematical\nsentences are true and, hence, that fictionalism is false.\n\nFictionalists have developed two different kinds of responses to this\nargument. The first one, due to Field (1980, 2016), can be called the\nnominalization response, and the version of fictionalism it\ngives us can be called hard-road fictionalism. The second\nresponse, developed by Balaguer (1996a, 1998a), Melia (2000), Rosen\n(2001), Yablo (2005), Bueno (2009), and Leng (2010), can be called the\nno-nominalization response, and the version of fictionalism\nit gives us can be called easy-road fictionalism, or\nweasel fictionalism. Moreover, (The names here are due to\nColyvan and Melia; the former speaks of \u2018hard-road\nnominalism\u2019 and \u2018easy-road nominalism\u2019, and the\nlatter speaks of \u2018weasel nominalism\u2019.)\n\nField\u2019s hard-road response is based on the rejection of premise\n(i). He argues that mathematics is, in fact, not\nindispensable to empirical science. Field tries to establish this\nthesis by arguing that our empirical theories can be\nnominalized, i.e., reformulated in a way that avoids\nreference to, and existential quantification over, abstract objects.\nThis is an extremely controversial claim, and it is very difficult to\nestablish, for presumably, one would have to actually carry out the\nnominalization for every one of our empirical theories\u2014thus, the\nname hard-road fictionalism. Field did not try to do this for\nall of our empirical theories. Rather, he tried to motivate his\nposition by explaining how the nominalization would go for one\nempirical theory, namely, Newtonian Gravitation Theory. Now, some\npeople have complained that even if Field\u2019s strategy could work\nfor this one theory, it might not work for other theories, and in\nparticular, Malament (1982) has argued that his strategy would\nnot work in connection with Quantum Mechanics (but see\nBalaguer (1996b and 1998a) for an argument that Field\u2019s strategy\ncan be extended to the case of quantum mechanics, and see\nBueno (2003) for a response). Moreover, there are several other\nobjections that have been raised against Field\u2019s\nprogram\u2014see, e.g., Malament (1982), Shapiro (1983), Resnik\n(1985), and Chihara (1990, chapter 8, section 5). On the other hand,\nthere are other works that develop, or provide motivation for,\nhard-road nominalist views; e.g., Arntzenius and Dorr (2012) develop a\nway to nominalize the theory of differentiable manifolds. At present,\nthe status of the Fieldian hard-road response to the Quine-Putnam\nargument remains controversial.\n\nBalaguer\u2019s easy-road response begins by granting premise (i) of\nthe Quine-Putnam argument\u2014i.e., by granting (for the sake of\nargument) that there do exist indispensable applications of\nmathematics to empirical science. Balaguer\u2019s strategy is simply\nto account for these applications from a fictionalist point of view.\nHis argument can be summarized as follows: If there are any such\nthings as abstract objects, then they are causally inert. But given\nthis, it follows that the truth of empirical science depends upon two\nsets of facts that hold or don\u2019t hold independently of one\nanother. One of these sets of facts is purely platonistic and\nmathematical, and the other is purely physical (or more precisely,\npurely anti-platonistic). Since these two sets of facts hold or\ndon\u2019t hold independently of one another, fictionalists can\nmaintain that (a) there does obtain a set of purely physical facts of\nthe sort required here, i.e., the sort needed to make empirical\nscience true, but (b) there doesn\u2019t obtain a set of purely\nplatonistic facts of the sort required for the truth of empirical\nscience (because there are no such things as abstract objects).\nTherefore, fictionalism is consistent with an essentially realistic\nview of empirical science, because fictionalists can maintain that\neven if there are no such things as mathematical objects and, hence,\nour empirical theories aren\u2019t strictly true, these theories\nstill paint an essentially accurate picture of the physical world,\nbecause the physical world is just the way it needs to be for\nempirical science to be true. In other words, fictionalists can\nmaintain that the physical world \u201cholds up its end of\nthe empirical-science bargain\u201d. Finally, to provide a view of\nwhat mathematics is doing in empirical science, the claim is that it\nfunctions as a descriptive or representational aid. In other words, it\ngives us an easy way of making claims about the physical world. For\ninstance, by making reference to real numbers\u2014or, better, by\nusing terms that purport to refer to real numbers\u2014we\ngive ourselves an easy way of describing the temperature states of\nphysical systems. And Balaguer argues that mathematics can succeed in\nits role as a descriptive aid even if it isn\u2019t true; indeed, he\nargues that truth is simply no help at all in this connection.\n\nOthers have developed similar views. For instance, Melia (2000) argues\nthat we can assert our empirical theories and then simply take\nback the platonistic/mathematical consequences of those\nassertions. And Rosen (2001) argues that fictionalism is epistemically\npermissible because another community of scientists could accept the\nvery same theories that we do while endorsing\u2014or, more to the\npoint, rationally endorsing\u2014a fictionalist attitude\ntoward the mathematical components of their theories. And Bueno (2009)\nargues that mathematics plays a descriptive role in empirical science,\nand because of this, it needn\u2019t be true in order to be\napplicable. And Leng (2010) argues that the indispensability argument\ndoes not refute fictionalism because fictionalists can provide an\nadequate account of the success of science.\n\nYablo (2005, 2002a, 2002b) also develops a view like this (and\nit\u2019s worth noting that his view here draws heavily on the work\nof Walton (1990)). Yablo claims that mathematics appears in science as\na representational aid and that it doesn\u2019t need to be true in\norder to do this well. But his version of the view is a bit different\nbecause he thinks that the sentences of our platonistically formulated\nempirical theories\u2014or at least typical utterances of these\nsentences\u2014are actually true, because their real\ncontents are nominalistic. To use a trivial sort of example,\nconsider the sentence\n\n(M) The number of Martian moons is 2.\n\nAccording to Yablo, typical utterances of sentences like (M) are\nanalogous to ordinary instances of figurative speech, e.g., sentences\nlike\n\n(A) The average mum has 2.4 children.\n\nThe syntactic form of (A) seems to suggest that it\u2019s about an\nactual object known as the average mum; but, of course, it\nisn\u2019t\u2014to read it in this way would be to misunderstand\nwhat people mean when they utter sentences like (A). Likewise,\naccording to Yablo, while it might seem that (M) is making a claim\npartially about an actual object known as 2, it really\nisn\u2019t. Rather, the real content of (M)\u2014i.e., what typical\nutterances of this sentence really say\u2014is that there\nare two Martian moons. And, of course, this claim\u2014i.e., the\nclaim that there are two Martian moons\u2014is not a claim about the\nnumber 2 or any other abstract object; it is nominalistically kosher.\nIn sum, then, the idea here is that fictionalists about pure\nmathematics can endorse a paraphrase nominalist view of mixed\nmathematical sentences.\n\n(It is worth noting that Yablo also seems to think that, at least\nsometimes, pure mathematical sentences have real\ncontents\u2014i.e., really say things\u2014that are nominalistic and\ntrue. For instance, he thinks that, at least sometimes, sentences like\n\u20183 + 2 = 5\u2019 say things like if there are three Fs and\ntwo Gs, then (barring overlap) there are five F-or-Gs. Moreover,\nat times, Yablo seems to at least hint at the view that, at least\nsometimes, when we utter sentences like \u20183 is prime,\u2019 what\nwe\u2019re really saying is that \u20183 is prime\u2019 is true or\nacceptable according to the theory (or the story, or the game) of\narithmetic. It\u2019s not clear how seriously Yablo takes this idea,\nhowever; at any rate, it seems pretty clear that if he endorses it at\nall, he thinks it\u2019s true in only some contexts, i.e., of only\nsome pure mathematical utterances. Whatever Yablo\u2019s view is,\nthough, it\u2019s important to note that views of this general\nkind\u2014i.e., views that take pure mathematical sentences to have\nreal contents, or really say things, that are nominalistic and\ntrue\u2014are not versions of fictionalism at all, as that\nview has been defined here. They are rather versions of paraphrase\nnominalism, and so they are subject to the argument against that view\ngiven in section 1.2. We will return (very briefly) to the issue of\nwhether Yablo\u2019s view is really a version of fictionalism in\nsection 2.3.)\n\nFor more on views like Yablo\u2019s, see Plebani (2018) and Berto and\nPlebani (2015). \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that proponents of easy-road nominalism do not\nprefer their view to Field\u2019s simply because it\u2019s\n\u201ceasier\u201d, or because it doesn\u2019t involve a commitment\nto the controversial claim that our empirical theories can be\nnominalized. Melia, Yablo, and Balaguer all argue that the view is\nindependently superior to Field\u2019s view because it fits better\nwith actual scientific practice.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that easy-road responses to the\nQuine-Putnam argument have been developed by people who don\u2019t\nendorse fictionalism\u2014e.g., Sober (1993), Maddy (1995, 1997),\nMortensen (1998), and Azzouni (2004). \n\nA response to the easy-road view has been given by Colyvan (2002,\n2010) and Baker (2005, 2009). They argue that mathematics\ndoesn\u2019t just play a descriptive role in science. It also plays\nan explanatory role. For instance, Baker considers a case\ninvolving various species of periodic cicadas in which the nymphal\nstage is either 13 or 17 years. Why are the nymphal stages 13 or 17\nyears? According to evolutionary biologists, the answer is that 13 and\n17 are prime numbers, and this minimizes intersections with other\nperiodic species. Colyvan and Baker argue that cases like\nthis\u2014cases in which mathematical objects play an indispensable\nrole in the explanations of physical phenomena\u2014provide us with a\nbetter and more powerful version of the indispensability argument.\nIndeed, they argue that if there really are cases involving genuinely\nmathematical explanations of physical phenomena, then easy-road\nversions of fictionalism cannot succeed. But this claim is open to\ndebate, and responses to these explanatory versions of the\nindispensability argument have been given by Melia (2002), Leng\n(2005b), Bangu (2008), Daly and Langford (2009), and Yablo (2012).\n2.2 Objectivity\n\nA second objection to fictionalism is based on the idea that\nfictionalists cannot account for the objectivity of\nmathematics. It is an obvious fact about mathematical practice that\nthere\u2019s some sort of objectivity at work in that practice.\nThere\u2019s an important difference in mathematics between sentences\nlike \u20182 + 2 = 4\u2019 and \u20183 is prime\u2019 on the one\nhand and \u20182 + 2 = 5\u2019 and \u20183 is composite\u2019 on\nthe other. There\u2019s obviously some sense in which the\nfirst two sentences, but not the second two, are\n\u201ccorrect\u201d, or \u201cright\u201d, or \u201cgood\u201d,\nor some such thing. The most obvious thing to say here is that the\nfirst two sentence are true whereas the latter two are\nfalse. But fictionalists cannot say this; they\u2019re\ncommitted to saying that all four of these sentences are untrue. Thus,\nthe question arises whether fictionalists have any adequate account of\nthe objectivity of mathematics\u2014i.e., of the differences between\nthese two kinds of sentences.\n\nOnce again, there are two different responses that fictionalists have\ngiven to this problem. These two responses give us versions of\nfictionalism that, for lack of a better pair of terms, can be called\nformalistic fictionalism and non-formalistic\nfictionalism.\n\nThe formalistic view has been developed by Field (1980, 1989, 1998).\nOn his view, the difference between \u20183 is prime\u2019 and\n\u20183 is composite\u2019 is analogous to the difference between,\nsay, \u2018Santa Claus wears a red suit\u2019 and \u2018Santa Claus\nwears a green suit\u2019. More specifically, Field\u2019s idea is\nthat the difference between sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019\nand \u20183 is composite\u2019 is that the former (but not the\nlatter) are part of a certain well-known \u201cstory\u201d, namely,\nthe story of mathematics. Field puts this point by saying that while\n\u20183 is prime\u2019 and \u20183 is composite\u2019 are both\nstrictly untrue, the former is true in the story of\nmathematics, whereas the latter is not. Now, most of\nField\u2019s view here is consistent with both formalistic\nfictionalism and non-formalistic fictionalism. The difference between\nthese two views has to do with what fictionalists take the story of\nmathematics to consist in. For Field, the story of mathematics\nconsists essentially in a bunch of formal systems, namely, the ones\nthat we currently accept. More precisely, he says (1998, p. 391) that\na mathematical sentence is fictionalistically correct if and only if\nit is \u201ca consequence of accepted axioms [in\na]\u2026sense of consequence that goes a bit beyond first-order\nconsequence in including the logic of the quantifier \u2018only\nfinitely many\u2019\u201d. So on this view, the difference between\nsentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 and \u20183 is\ncomposite\u2019\u2014the reason the former are \u201ccorrect\u201d\nand the latter are not\u2014is that the former follow from accepted\nmathematical axioms. (This view has also been endorsed by Leng (2010);\nshe says that mathematical acceptability comes down to following from\naccepted axioms.)\n\nBalaguer (2001, 2009) argues that Field\u2019s formalistic view\ncan\u2019t be right, and he develops a non-formalistic alternative to\nit. His argument against the formalistic view is that it cannot\naccount for all of the objectivity that we find in mathematics. Most\nimportantly, the formalistic view entails (incorrectly) that there can\nbe no objectively correct answers to questions that ask about the\ntruth values of mathematical sentences that are undecidable in\ncurrently accepted mathematical theories. The most famous example here\nis probably the continuum hypothesis (CH), which is undecidable in\ncurrently accepted set theories, e.g., Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory\n(ZF). (In other words, ZF is consistent with both CH and ~CH; i.e.,\nZF+CH and ZF+~CH are both consistent set theories.) Given this, it\nfollows from Field\u2019s view that neither CH nor ~CH is part of the\nstory of mathematics and, hence, that there is no objectively correct\nanswer to the CH question. This, however, seems unacceptable, because\nit could turn out that mathematicians are going to discover\nan objectively correct answer to the CH question. For instance,\nsuppose that some mathematician came up with a new axiom candidate AX\nsuch that (i) all mathematicians agreed that AX was an intuitively\nobvious claim about sets, and (ii) ZF+AX entailed CH. If this\nhappened, then mathematicians would say that they had proven\nCH, and that they had discovered that CH was correct, and so\non. Field\u2019s view would force us to say that if we endorsed AX,\nthen CH would become true in the story of mathematics. But\nthis seems to get things wrong. Given the intuitive obviousness of AX,\nit seems very natural to say that, in this scenario, mathematicians\ndiscovered that CH had been true (or \u201ccorrect\u201d, or true in\nthe story of mathematics, or whatever we want to call it) all\nalong\u2014i.e., that we didn\u2019t just make this up by\nendorsing a new theory. And, again, it seems that this is what\nmathematicians would say. So, Balaguer argues, Field\u2019s\nformalistic view of the objectivity of mathematics is\nunacceptable.\n\nBalaguer\u2019s non-formalistic version of fictionalism retains\nField\u2019s thesis that mathematical \u201ccorrectness\u201d has\nto do with being true in the story of mathematics, but it abandons the\nFieldian view that the story of mathematics consists in currently\naccepted axioms. According to Balaguer, the so-called \u201cstory of\nmathematics\u201d consists in the thesis that there actually exist\nabstract mathematical objects of the kinds that platonists have in\nmind, i.e., the kinds that our mathematical theories purport to be\nabout. Thus, on this view, a mathematical sentence is\nfictionalistically correct if and only if it would have been true if\nthere had actually existed abstract mathematical objects of the kinds\nthat platonists have in mind. Balaguer argues that if fictionalists\nadopt this view, they can avoid the above problem with Field\u2019s\nview and, more generally, they can completely solve the problem of\nobjectivity because they can mimic everything platonists say about\nobjectivity. \n2.3 Revolutionism and Hermeneuticism\n\nAnother objection to fictionalism is put forward by Burgess\n(2004)\u2014and it should be noted that the argument here has roots\nin Burgess (1983) and Burgess and Rosen (1997). The argument can be\nput like this:\n\nFictionalists face a dilemma: they have to endorse either hermeneutic\nfictionalism or revolutionary fictionalism, but neither is plausible.\nWe can define hermeneutic fictionalism as the view that mathematicians\n(and perhaps ordinary folk) intend their mathematical talk to be taken\nas a form of fiction; more specifically, the view here is that,\naccording to ordinary mathematical intentions, singular terms like\n\u20183\u2019 are not supposed to refer, and sentences like \u20183\nis prime\u2019 are not supposed to be true. But hermeneutic\nfictionalism is implausible and unmotivated; as an empirical\nhypothesis about what mathematicians intend, there is simply no good\nevidence for it, and it seems obviously false. Revolutionary\nfictionalism, on the other hand, is the view that (a) mathematicians\ndo not intend their utterances to be taken as fiction, or as\nnon-literal in any other way; and so (b) we should interpret\nmathematicians as really asserting what their sentences say, i.e., as\nmaking assertions that are about (or that purport to be about)\nmathematical objects; but (c) since there are no such things as\nmathematical objects, the assertions of mathematicians are simply\nuntrue claims. But revolutionary fictionalism is implausible as well;\ngiven the track records of philosophers and mathematicians, it would\nbe \u201ccomically immodest\u201d for philosophers to presume that\nthey had discovered a problem with mathematics (Burgess, 2004, p.\n30).\n\nNo one has ever defended hermeneutic fictionalism, as it\u2019s\ndefined above. Yablo (2002a) claims that his view is a version of\nhermeneutic fictionalism\u2014and Plebani (2018) follows him in this\nway of talking\u2014but the view that these philosophers have in mind\nis a bit different from the hermeneutic fictionalist view described\nabove. Yablo does not claim that mathematicians intend their\nutterances of sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 to be taken as\nfictional claims. Rather, he thinks these utterances are (at least\nsometimes, or perhaps typically) analogous to ordinary examples of\nfigurative speech, e.g., sentences like \u2018The back burner is\nwhere you put things to let them simmer.\u2019 This sentence contains\na singular term\u2014\u2018the back burner\u2019\u2014that seems\n(syntactically) to be a denoting expression; but it\u2019s not really\na denoting expression (at least in typical cases) and to interpret it\nas a genuine denoting expression in sentences like the above would be\nto badly misunderstand what typical speakers of sentences like this\nintend to be saying. Yablo thinks that something like this is true in\nconnection with typical utterances of (pure and mixed) mathematical\nsentences, e.g., sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 and\n\u2018The number of Martian moons is 2.\u2019 So Yablo is certainly\nproposing a hermeneutic nominalist view, but it\u2019s not\nclear that his view is best thought of as a kind of hermeneutic\nfictionalism. As was noted above (section 2.1), the view\nmight be better classified as a sort of paraphrase nominalism. Yablo\ncalls his view figuralism, and he talks as if it is a version\nof fictionalism. But he seems to be using the term\n\u2018fictionalism\u2019 differently from how it\u2019s been\ndefined here. What he likely has in mind is this: on a\nliteral reading, mathematical sentences are untrue, as\nfictionalism says, but there\u2019s an alternative reading on which\nthey come out true (and nominalistically kosher). But what makes it\nawkward to take Yablo\u2019s view as a version of fictionalism is\nthat he seems to think that what (pure and mixed) mathematical\nsentences really say\u2014or, more precisely, what typical\nutterances of these sentences really say\u2014is true and\nnominalistic in content. This sounds more like paraphrase nominalism\nthan fictionalism.\n\nStanley (2001) has mounted several arguments against hermeneutic\nfictionalism. Responses to his arguments are given by Yablo (2002a)\nand Liggins (2010). \n\nIn contrast to Yablo, Leng (2005a, 2010), Daly (2006), and Balaguer\n(2009) respond to Burgess\u2019s argument by defending revolutionary\nfictionalism. Leng\u2019s version of the response is based on the\nclaim that it is acceptable for philosophers to evaluate and criticize\nthe work of mathematicians. Of course, Leng acknowledges that\nmathematics is a very successful practice and that philosophers have\nto respect this, but her claim is that we can account for the success\nof mathematics without supposing that it\u2019s true. And\ngiven this, she argues, we can rationally evaluate and criticize\nmathematical practice from the outside, from a philosophical point of\nview.\n\nBut there\u2019s another kind of revolutionary fictionalism that\ndoesn\u2019t involve any sort of criticism of mathematics.\nAs it\u2019s formulated above, revolutionary fictionalism is simply\nthe view that (i) we should interpret mathematicians as\nasserting what their sentences say, so that (ii) their\nutterances are untrue claims about abstract objects. But it\ndoesn\u2019t follow from this that there\u2019s something\nwrong with mathematics\u2014something worthy of criticism.\nThis suggests that \u2018revolutionary fictionalism\u2019\nisn\u2019t a very good name for the view. \u2018Assertional\nfictionalism\u2019 would be a better name. If we spoke this way, then\nwe could say that there are both revolutionary and non-revolutionary\nkinds of assertional fictionalism. Revolutionary assertional\nfictionalists would say that we should change what we\u2019re doing\nin mathematics so that we\u2019re no longer making untrue claims;\ne.g., we should start intending our mathematical claims to be taken as\nfictions, or we should start using our mathematical sentences to mean\nwhat if-thenists think they mean, or some such thing.\nNon-revolutionary assertional fictionalists, on the other hand, would\nsay that there\u2019s nothing wrong with mathematics, as it\u2019s\ncurrently practiced; they would admit that mathematical sentences like\n\u20184 is even\u2019 aren\u2019t true; but they would maintain\nthat there\u2019s nothing wrong with this because the mark of\ngoodness in mathematics isn\u2019t truth\u2014it\u2019s truth in\nthe story of mathematics, or some such thing. \n\nField seems to endorse some view in the neighborhood of this sort of\nnon-revolutionism. In discussing Burgess\u2019s argument in the\npreface to the second edition of Science Without Numbers, he\nsays this: \u201cIn my view, this is a false dichotomy. I certainly\ndidn\u2019t think that the account I was providing was\n\u2018hermeneutic,\u2019 but it wasn\u2019t\n\u2018revolutionary\u2019 either: I took what I was doing, rather,\nas providing an account that explains why ordinary mathematical\npractice is perfectly fine.\u201d (Field, 2016, p. 4.)\n\nFinally, Balaguer (2009) argues that there are ways for fictionalists\nto avoid both hermeneuticism and assertionalism and, hence, that they\nmight be able to avoid Burgess\u2019s dilemma altogether. Moreover,\nField (2016) seems to endorse a view like this as well. But\nArmour-Garb (2011) has argued that the version of (non-hermeneuticist,\nnon-assertional) fictionalism that Balaguer proposes here is\nuntenable. \n2.4 Similarity to Fiction\n\nA few people\u2014e.g., Katz (1998), Thomas (2000 and 2002), Hoffman\n(2004), Burgess (2004), and Thomasson (2013)\u2014have objected to\nfictionalism on the grounds that there are obvious disanalogies\nbetween mathematics and fiction. (What exactly the disanalogies are\ndiffers in different versions of the objection. E.g., Katz argues that\nconsistency is an important criterion for goodness in mathematics but\nnot in fiction. And Burgess argues that the question of whether\nmathematical objects exist is not empirically meaningful, whereas the\nquestion of whether the (non-abstract) objects in our fictional\nstories exist is empirically meaningful.)\n\nOne way that fictionalists can respond to this objection is to claim\nthat it\u2019s simply irrelevant because fictionalism does not\ninvolve the claim that there are no important disanalogies between\nmathematics and fiction. As it was defined above, fictionalism is the\nview that (a) our mathematical sentences and theories do purport to be\nabout abstract mathematical objects, as platonism suggests, but (b)\nthere are no such things as abstract objects, and so (c) our\nmathematical theories are not true. There is no claim about fictional\ndiscourse at all here, and so fictionalists can simply deny that their\nview entails that there are no important disanalogies between\nmathematics and fiction.\n\nNow, this does not mean that fictionalists can\u2019t claim that\nthere are some relevant analogies between mathematics and fiction.\nThey can of course claim that there are; e.g., they might\nwant to say that, as is the case in mathematics, there are no such\nthings as fictional objects and, because of this, typical fictional\nsentences are not literally true. But by making such claims,\nfictionalists do not commit themselves to any stronger claims about\nthe analogy between mathematics and fiction\u2014e.g., that\nmathematical discourse is a kind of fictional discourse\u2014and they\ncertainly don\u2019t commit themselves to the claim that there are no\nimportant disanalogies between the two enterprises. In short,\nfictionalism is perfectly consistent with the claim that there are\nnumerous important disanalogies between mathematics and fiction.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that there are some fictionalists\nwho do seem to want to make some stronger claims about the analogy\nbetween mathematics and fiction. Such people might have to take\nobjections of the above kind more seriously. But none of the\nfictionalists discussed in this essay endorses any very strong claims\nof this kind; in particular, none of them says anything that entails\nthat there are no important disanalogies between mathematics and\nfiction. On the other hand, it should be noted that Yablo and Bueno\nhave made some claims in this connection that go beyond what\nfictionalists need to say. For instance, Bueno (2009) says that\nmathematical objects are similar to fictional characters in that they\nare abstract artifacts (in saying this, he follows\nThomasson\u2019s (1999) view of fictional characters). And Yablo has\nmade some relatively strong claims about an analogy that he thinks\nholds between mathematical utterances and metaphorical\nutterances, or figurative utterances. Thus, Yablo\u2019s particular\nversion of fictionalism is open to objections to the effect that\nmathematical utterances are in fact not similar or analogous\nto metaphorical utterances. Some objections of this kind have been\nraised by Stanley (2001), and Yablo responds to them in his (2002a).\nBut since Yablo doesn\u2019t claim that mathematical utterances are\nanalogous to fictional utterances, he does not have to\nrespond to objections of the kind mentioned at the start of the\npresent subsection.\n2.5 Accepting and Believing\n\nAs became clear in section 2.2, while fictionalists think that\nsentences like \u20182 + 2 = 4\u2019 are strictly speaking false,\nthey nonetheless think they\u2019re \u201ccorrect\u201d in some\nsense of the term. What, then, is the fictionalist\u2019s\nattitude toward these sentences? Following Bas van Fraassen\n(1980), who endorses a similar view with respect to empirical science,\nthe standard fictionalist line here is that they accept\nsentences like \u20182 + 2 = 4\u2019 without believing\nthem. How exactly acceptance should be defined is a matter of some\ncontroversy, but one obvious way to proceed here is to claim that\nfictionalists accept a pure mathematical sentence S if and\nonly if they believe that S is true in the story of mathematics. \n\nSome people object to the distinction between belief and acceptance.\nHorwich (1991), O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne (1997), and Burgess and Rosen\n(1997) present arguments for the claim that there is no real\ndifference between acceptance and belief because, roughly, (a) to\nbelieve something is just to be disposed to behave in certain ways,\nand (b) those who believe that 2 + 2 = 4 and those who allegedly only\naccept that 2 + 2 = 4 are presumably disposed to behave in exactly the\nsame ways. \n\nDaly (2008) and Leng (2010) provide a number of responses to this\nargument. One point Daly makes is that fictionalists are in fact\nnot disposed to behave in the same ways that platonists are.\nThey\u2019re disposed to behave very differently in response to\nquestions like, \u201cDo there actually exist any such things as\nnumbers?\u201d \n2.6 Mysterious Extra Content\n\nThomasson (2013) raises an objection to Yablo\u2019s specific version\nof fictionalism. As we saw above, Yablo (2005, 2002a, 2002b)\ndistinguishes between the literal contents and the real\ncontents of sentences like \n\n(M) The number of Martian moons is 2.\n\nThomasson argues that Yablo is committed to the claim that\nsomething more is needed for the truth of the literal\ncontents of sentences like (M) than is needed for the truth of the\nreal contents of these sentences. But what could this extra\nsomething be? According to Thomasson, this is obscure, and unless\nYablo can say something more about this, we ought not to accept his\nview. \n\nOne response to this\u2014given by Contessa (2016, p. 771)\u2014is\nthat it\u2019s obvious what more is needed; it needs to be the case\nthat there are \u201cmind-independent, non-spatiotemporally located,\ncausally inert abstract objects.\u201d \n\nA different response is given by Plebani (2018). He argues that\nregardless of whether Yablovian fictionalists can articulate two\ndifferent truth conditions for sentences like (M), the real and\nliteral contents of these sentences can be distinguished because they\nhave different subject matters. \n2.7 Other Objections\n\nThere are, of course, other objections to fictionalism. Probably the\nmost widely discussed is based on the claim that fictionalism is not a\ngenuinely nominalistic view because the very formulation of\nfictionalism includes statements that involve ontological commitments\nto abstract objects. It would be difficult to address this objection\nhere, though, because it takes a different form in connection with\neach different version of fictionalism, and as the foregoing\ndiscussion makes clear, there are many different versions of\nfictionalism (e.g., one can endorse either hard-road fictionalism or\neasy-road fictionalism; and both of these views can be combined with\neither formalistic fictionalism or non-formalistic fictionalism; and\nany of these views can be combined with hermeneutic fictionalism or\nrevolutionary assertional fictionalism or non-revolutionary\nassertional fictionalism; and so on). It should be noted, though, that\nseveral different defenders of fictionalism have responded to worries\nabout the nominalistic status of their own particular versions of\nfictionalism. In particular, Field (1989) defends his version of\nfictionalism against the charge that it is commits to the existence of\nspacetime points, which one might think are not\nnominalistically kosher; and Balaguer (1998a) defends his version\nagainst the charge that it (and, indeed, Field\u2019s version) are\ncommitted to the existence of stories, which would presumably\nbe abstract objects if they existed; and finally, Rosen (2001) defends\nhis view against the charge that it commits to theories and\npossible worlds. Balaguer and Rosen are both concerned with\nthe worry that ficitionalists are committed to the existence of\nsentence types, which would presumably be abstract objects.\nDaly presents a version of this worry in his (2008), and he provides a\ncounter to Balaguer\u2019s response to the worry. He also provides a\ncounter to a response that Rosen had given earlier, in his (1990).\n\nAnother objection to fictionalism (or, more precisely, to easy-road\nfictionalism) is raised by Szabo (2001). Let S be some mathematical\nsentence like \u20184 is even\u2019. Szabo argues against easy-road\nfictionalists on the grounds that if they deny that S is true but\ncontinue to use it in ways that seem indistinguishable from the ways\nthat platonists use it, then they\u2019re essentially committed to\nsaying things like \u20184 is even, but I don\u2019t believe\nit\u2019\u2014which, according to Szabo, gets them into trouble with\nrespect to Moore\u2019s paradox. \n\nFinally, Chihara (2010) raises objections to the fictionalist views of\nboth Field and Balaguer. \n3. Conclusion\n\nThere are several different objections to fictionalism out there,\nbut fictionalists have responses to all of them, and it is not at all\nobvious that any of the objections succeeds in refuting fictionalism.\nThus, at the present time, it seems at least prima facie plausible to\nsuppose that fictionalism can be defended. On the other hand, if the\nclaims of section 1 are correct, then fictionalists do not have a\ncompelling positive argument in favor of their view. The arguments of\nsections 1.2\u20131.4 suggest that there are good reasons for\nrejecting the various anti-platonistic alternatives to fictionalism\nand, hence, for thinking that platonism and fictionalism are the two\nbest views of mathematics, but there does not seem to be any good\nargument for favoring fictionalism over platonism or vice\nversa. Now, most fictionalists would probably say\u2014and some\nhave said (see, e.g., Leng, 2010)\u2014that this situation\nitself already gives us a good reason to favor fictionalism over\nplatonism. For if we take the claim that there is no good positive\nargument for platonism and we combine it with Ockham\u2019s razor\n(i.e., the principle that tells us that if two theories account for\nall the same facts, then, ceteris parabis, we ought to\nendorse the more ontologically parsimonious of the two), then we seem\nto be led to the result that fictionalism is superior to platonism. It\nshould be noted, however, that this argument is explicitly rejected by\nat least two of the defenders of fictionalism discussed above. Rosen\n(see, e.g., Burgess and Rosen, 1997) doubts that there is any good\nreason to accept Ockham\u2019s razor, and Balaguer (1998a) argues\nthat even if we accept it, there are reasons to think that it is not\napplicable in the present case. Thus, Rosen and Balaguer both think\nthat, at present, we do not have any good reason to endorse platonism\nor fictionalism. Moreover, as was noted in section 1.3, Bueno (2009)\nthinks fictionalists should be agnostic about the existence\nof abstract objects; this seems to be more or less equivalent to\nRosen\u2019s view; Balaguer\u2019s view is a bit different because\nhe actually thinks that there\u2019s no fact of the matter whether\nabstract objects exist. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Armour-Garb, B., 2011, \u201cUnderstanding Mathematical\nFictionalism,\u201d <em>Philosophia Mathematica</em>, 19:\n335\u201344.", "Arnzenius, F. and C.
