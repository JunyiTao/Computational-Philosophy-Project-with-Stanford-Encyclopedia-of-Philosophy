    "main_text": "\n\nBeauty is an important part of our lives. Ugliness too. It is no\nsurprise then that philosophers since antiquity have been interested\nin our experiences of and judgments about beauty and ugliness. They\nhave tried to understand the nature of these experiences and\njudgments, and they have also wanted to know whether these experiences\nand judgments were legitimate. Both these projects took a sharpened\nform in the twentieth century, when this part of our lives came under\na sustained attack in both European and North American intellectual\ncircles. Much of the discourse about beauty since the eighteenth\ncentury had deployed a notion of the \u201caesthetic\u201d, and so\nthat notion in particular came in for criticism. This disdain for the\naesthetic may have roots in a broader cultural Puritanism, which fears\nthe connection between the aesthetic and pleasure. At one time, from\nthe 1960s to the 1990s, even to suggest that an artwork might be good\nbecause it is pleasurable, as opposed to cognitively, morally or\npolitically beneficial, was to court derision. (This is less true\nnow.) The twentieth century was not kind to the notions of beauty or\nthe aesthetic. Nevertheless, there were always some\nthinkers\u2014philosophers, as well as others in the study of\nparticular arts\u2014who persisted in thinking seriously about beauty\nand the aesthetic. In the first part of this essay, we will look at\nthe particularly rich account of judgments of beauty given to us by\nImmanuel Kant. The notion of a \u201cjudgment of taste\u201d is\ncentral to Kant\u2019s account and also to virtually everyone working\nin traditional aesthetics; so we begin by examining Kant\u2019s\ncharacterization of the judgment of taste. In the second part, we look\nat the issues that twentieth century thinkers raised. In the third\npart, we consider disinterestedness, which is taken by Kant to be part\nof the judgment of taste. We end, in the fourth part, by drawing on\nKant\u2019s account of the judgment of taste to consider whether the\nnotion of the aesthetic is viable.\n",
