    "main_text": "The DN Model || Motivation for the DN Model: Nomic Expectability and a Regularity Account of Causation\n2.4 Motivation for the DN Model: Nomic Expectability and a Regularity Account of Causation\n\nWhy suppose that all (or even some) explanations have a DN or\nIS structure? There are two ideas which play a central\nmotivating role in Hempel\u2019s (1965b) discussion. The first connects the information provided by\na DN argument with a certain conception of what it is to\nachieve understanding of why something happens\u2014it appeals to an\nidea about the object or point of giving an explanation. Hempel\nwrites\n\n\n\u2026 a DN explanation answers the question\n\u201cWhy did the explanandum-phenomenon occur?\u201d by\nshowing that the phenomenon resulted from certain particular\ncircumstances, specified in \\(C_1,C_2,\\ldots,C_k\\), in accordance with\nthe laws \\(L_1,L_2,\\ldots,L_{\\gamma}\\). By pointing this out, the\nargument shows that, given the particular circumstances and the laws\nin question, the occurrence of the phenomenon was to be\nexpected; and it is in this sense that the explanation enables us\nto understand why the phenomenon occurred. (1965b: 337,\nitalics in original)\n\n\nOne can think of IS explanation as involving a natural\ngeneralization of this idea. While an IS explanation does not\nshow that the explanandum-phenomenon was to be expected with\ncertainty, it does the next best thing: it shows that the\nexplanandum-phenomenon is at least to be expected with high\nprobability and in this way provides understanding. Stated more\ngenerally, both the DN and IS models, share the\ncommon idea that, as Salmon (1989) puts it, \n\n\nthe essence of scientific explanation can be described as nomic\nexpectability\u2014that is expectability on the basis of lawful\nconnections. (1989: 57)\n\n\nThe second main motivation for the DN/IS model has to do with\nthe role of causal claims in scientific explanation. There is\nconsiderable disagreement among philosophers about whether all\nexplanations in science and in ordinary life are causal and also\ndisagreement about what the distinction (if any) between causal and\nnon-causal explanations consists in. Nonetheless, virtually everyone,\nincluding Hempel, agrees that many scientific explanations cite\ninformation about causes. However, Hempel, along with most other early\nadvocates of the DN model, is unwilling to take the notion of\ncausation as primitive in the theory of explanation\u2014that is, he\nwas unwilling to simply say that X figures in an explanation of\nY if and only if X causes Y. Instead, adherents\nof the DN model have generally looked for an account of\ncausation that satisfies the empiricist requirements described in\n Section 1.\n In particular, advocates of the DN model have generally\naccepted a broadly Humean or regularity theory of causation, according\nto which (very roughly) all causal claims imply the existence of some\ncorresponding regularity (a \u201claw\u201d) linking cause to\neffect. This is then taken to show that all causal explanations\n\u201cimply,\u201d perhaps only \u201cimplicitly,\u201d that such\na law/regularity exists and hence that laws are \u201cinvolved\u201d\nin all such explanations, just as the DN model claims.\n\nTo illustrate this line of argument, consider\n\n(3)\n The impact of my knee on the desk caused the tipping over of the\ninkwell.\n\n\n(3)\n is a so-called singular causal explanation, advanced by Michael\nScriven (1962) as a counterexample to the claim that the DN\nmodel describes necessary conditions for successful explanation.\nAccording to Scriven,\n (3)\n explains the tipping over of the inkwell even though no law or\ngeneralization figures explicitly in\n (3)\n and\n (3)\n appears to consist of a single sentence, rather than a deductive\nargument. Hempel\u2019s response (1965b: 360ff) is that the\noccurrence of \u201ccaused\u201d in\n (3)\n should not be left unanalyzed or taken as explanatory just as it\nstands. Instead\n (3)\n should be understood as \u201cimplicitly\u201d or\n\u201ctacitly\u201d claiming there is a \u201claw\u201d or\nregularity linking knee impacts to tipping over of inkwells. According\nto Hempel, it is the implicit claim that some such law holds that\n\u201cdistinguishes\u201d\n (3)\n from \u201ca mere sequential narrative\u201d in which the spilling\nis said to follow the impact but without any claim of causal\nconnection\u2014a narrative that (Hempel thinks) would clearly not be\nexplanatory. This linking law is the nomological premise in the\nDN argument that, according to Hempel, is\n\u201cimplicitly\u201d asserted by\n (3).\n\nThe basic idea is thus that a proper explication of the role of causal\nclaims in explanation leads via a Humean or regularity theory of\ncausation, to the conclusion that, at least ideally, explanations\nshould satisfy the DN/IS model. Let us call this line of\nargument the \u201chidden structure\u201d argument in recognition of\nthe role it assigns to a hidden (or at least non-explicit) DN\nstructure that is claimed to be associated with\n (3).\n\nAt this point a comment is in order regarding a feature of this\nproposal that may seem puzzling. The boundaries of the category\n\u201cscientific explanation\u201d are far from clear, but while\n (3)\n is arguably an explanation, it is not what one usually thinks of as\n\u201cscience\u201d\u2014instead it is a claim from \u201cordinary\nlife\u201d or \u201ccommon sense\u201d. This raises the question of\nwhy adherents of the DN/IS model don\u2019t simply respond\nto the alleged counterexample\n (3)\n by denying that it is an instance of the category \u201cscientific\nexplanation\u201d\u2014that is, by claiming that the DN/IS\nmodel is not an attempt to reconstruct the structure of explanations\nlike\n (3)\n but is rather only meant to apply to explanations that are properly\nregarded as \u201cscientific\u201d. The fact that this response is\nnot often adopted by advocates of the DN model is an\nindication of the extent to which, as noted in\n Section 1,\n it is implicitly assumed in most discussions of scientific\nexplanation that there are important similarities or continuities in\nstructure between explanations like\n (3)\n and explanations that are more obviously scientific and that these\nsimilarities that should be captured by some common account that\napplies to both. Indeed, it is a striking feature not just of Hempel\n(1965b) but of many other\ntreatments of scientific explanation that much of the discussion in\nfact focuses on \u201cordinary life\u201d singular causal\nexplanations similar to\n (3),\n the tacit assumption being that conclusions about the structure of\nsuch explanations have fairly direct implications for understanding\nexplanation in science.\n",
