    "main_text": "\n\nPragmatic theories of truth are usually associated either with C.S.\nPeirce\u2019s proposal that true beliefs will be accepted \u201cat\nthe end of inquiry\u201d or with William James\u2019 proposal that\ntruth be defined in terms of utility. More broadly, however, pragmatic\ntheories of truth focus on the connection between truth and epistemic\npractices, notably practices of inquiry and assertion. Depending on\nthe particular pragmatic theory, true statements might be those that\nare useful to believe, that are the result of inquiry, that have\nwithstood ongoing examination, that meet a standard of warranted\nassertibility, or that represent norms of assertoric discourse. Like\nother theories of truth (e.g., coherence and deflationary theories)\npragmatic theories of truth are often put forward as an alternative to\ncorrespondence theories of truth. Unlike correspondence theories,\nwhich tend to see truth as a static relation between a truth-bearer\nand a truth-maker, pragmatic theories of truth tend to view truth as a\nfunction of the practices people engage in, and the commitments people\nmake, when they solve problems, make assertions, or conduct scientific\ninquiry. More broadly, pragmatic theories tend to emphasize the\nsignificant role the concept of truth plays across a range of\ndisciplines and discourses: not just scientific and fact-stating\ndiscourse but also ethical, legal, and political discourse as\nwell.\n\nPragmatic theories of truth have the effect of shifting attention away\nfrom what makes a statement true and toward what people mean or do in\ndescribing a statement as true. While sharing many of the impulses\nbehind deflationary theories of truth (in particular, the idea that\ntruth is not a substantial property), pragmatic theories also tend to\nview truth as more than just a useful tool for making generalizations.\nPragmatic theories of truth thus emphasize the broader practical and\nperformative dimensions of truth-talk, stressing the role truth plays\nin shaping certain kinds of discourse. These practical dimensions,\naccording to pragmatic theories, are essential to understanding the\nconcept of truth.\n\nAs these references to pragmatic theories (in the plural) would\nsuggest, over the years a number of different approaches have been\nclassified as \u201cpragmatic\u201d. This points to a degree of\nambiguity that has been present since the earliest formulations of the\npragmatic theory of truth: for example, the difference between\nPeirce\u2019s (1878 [1986: 273]) claim that truth is \u201cthe\nopinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who\ninvestigate\u201d and James\u2019 (1907 [1975: 106]) claim that\ntruth \u201cis only the expedient in the way of our thinking\u201d.\nSince then the situation has arguably gotten worse, not better. The\noften-significant differences between various pragmatic theories of\ntruth can make it difficult to determine their shared commitments (if\nany), while also making it difficult to critique these theories\noverall. Issues with one version may not apply to other versions,\nwhich means that pragmatic theories of truth may well present more of\na moving target than do other theories of truth. While few today would\nequate truth with expediency or utility (as James often seems to do)\nthere remains the question of what the pragmatic theory of truth\nstands for and how it is related to other theories. Still, pragmatic\ntheories of truth continue to be put forward and defended, often as\nserious alternatives to more widely accepted theories of truth\n",
