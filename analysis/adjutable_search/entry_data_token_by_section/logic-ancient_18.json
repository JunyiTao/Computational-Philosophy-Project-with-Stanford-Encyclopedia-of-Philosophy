    "main_text": "The Stoics || Logical Paradoxes\n5.5 Logical Paradoxes\n\n\nThe Stoics recognized the importance of both the Liar and the Sorites\nparadoxes (Cicero Acad. 2.95\u20138, Plut.\nComm.Not. 1059D\u2013E, Chrys. Log. Zet. col.IX).\nChrysippus may have tried to solve the Liar as follows: there is an\nineliminable ambiguity in the Liar sentence (\u2018I am speaking\nfalsely\u2019, uttered in isolation) between the assertibles (i)\n\u2018I falsely say I speak falsely\u2019 and (ii) \u2018I\nam speaking falsely\u2019 (i.e. I am doing what I\u2019m saying,\nviz. speaking falsely), of which, at any time the Liar sentence is\nuttered, precisely one is true, but it is arbitrary which one. (i)\nentails (iii) \u2018I am speaking truly\u2019 and is\nincompatible with (ii) and with (iv) \u2018I truly say I speak\nfalsely\u2019. (ii) entails (iv) and is incompatible with (i) and\n(iii). Thus bivalence is preserved (cf. Cavini 1993). Chrysippus\u2019\nstand on the Sorites seems to have been that vague borderline\nsentences uttered in the context of a Sorites series have no\nassertibles corresponding to them, and that it is obscure to us where\nthe borderline cases start, so that it is rational for us to stop\nanswering while still on safe ground (i.e. before we might begin to\nmake utterances with no assertible corresponding to them). The latter\nremark suggests Chrysippus was aware of the problem of higher order\nvagueness. Again, bivalence of assertibles is preserved (cf. Bobzien\n2002). The Stoics also discussed various other well-known\nparadoxes. In particular, for the paradoxes of presupposition, known\nin antiquity as the Horned One, they produced a Russellian-type\nsolution based on a hidden scope ambiguity of negation (cf. Bobzien\n2012)\n",
