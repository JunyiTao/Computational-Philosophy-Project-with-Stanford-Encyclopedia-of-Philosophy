    "main_text": "Heisenberg || Uncertainty relations or uncertainty principle?\n2.4 Uncertainty relations or uncertainty principle?\n\nLet us now move to another question about Heisenberg\u2019s\nrelations: do they express a principle of quantum theory?\nProbably the first influential author to call these relations a\n\u201cprinciple\u201d was Eddington, who, in his Gifford Lectures of\n1928 referred to them as the \u201cPrinciple of Indeterminacy\u201d.\nIn the English literature the name uncertainty principle became most\ncommon. It is used both by Condon and Robertson in 1929, and also in\nthe English version of Heisenberg\u2019s Chicago Lectures (Heisenberg\n1930), although, remarkably, nowhere in the original German version of\nthe same book (see also Cassidy 1998). Indeed, Heisenberg never seems\nto have endorsed the name \u201cprinciple\u201d for his relations.\nHis favourite terminology was \u201cinaccuracy relations\u201d\n(Ungenauigkeitsrelationen) or \u201cindeterminacy\nrelations\u201d (Unbestimmtheitsrelationen). We know only\none passage, in Heisenberg\u2019s own Gifford lectures, delivered in\n1955\u201356 (Heisenberg 1958: 43), where he mentioned that his\nrelations \u201care usually called relations of uncertainty or\nprinciple of indeterminacy\u201d. But this can well be read as his\nyielding to common practice rather than his own preference.\n\nBut does the relation\n (2)\n qualify as a principle of quantum mechanics? Several authors,\nforemost Karl Popper (1967), have contested this view. Popper argued\nthat the uncertainty relations cannot be granted the status of a\nprinciple on the grounds that they are derivable from the theory,\nwhereas one cannot obtain the theory from the uncertainty relations.\n(The argument being that one can never derive any equation, say, the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, or the commutation relation\n (1),\n from an inequality.)\n\nPopper\u2019s argument is, of course, correct but we think it misses\nthe point. There are many statements in physical theories which are\ncalled principles even though they are in fact derivable from other\nstatements in the theory in question. A more appropriate departing\npoint for this issue is not the question of logical priority but\nrather Einstein\u2019s distinction between \u201cconstructive\ntheories\u201d and \u201cprinciple theories\u201d.\n\nEinstein proposed this famous classification in Einstein 1919.\nConstructive theories are theories which postulate the existence of\nsimple entities behind the phenomena. They endeavour to reconstruct\nthe phenomena by framing hypotheses about these entities. Principle\ntheories, on the other hand, start from empirical principles, i.e.,\ngeneral statements of empirical regularities, employing no or only a\nbare minimum of theoretical terms. The purpose is to build up the\ntheory from such principles. That is, one aims to show how these\nempirical principles provide sufficient conditions for the\nintroduction of further theoretical concepts and structure.\n\nThe prime example of a theory of principle is thermodynamics. Here the\nrole of the empirical principles is played by the statements of the\nimpossibility of various kinds of perpetual motion machines. These are\nregarded as expressions of brute empirical fact, providing the\nappropriate conditions for the introduction of the concepts of energy\nand entropy and their properties. (There is a lot to be said about the\ntenability of this view, but that is not our topic here.)\n\nNow obviously, once the formal thermodynamic theory is built, one can\nalso derive the impossibility of the various kinds of\nperpetual motion. (They would violate the laws of energy conservation\nand entropy increase.) But this derivation should not misguide one\ninto thinking that they were no principles of the theory after all.\nThe point is just that empirical principles are statements that do not\nrely on the theoretical concepts (in this case entropy and energy) for\ntheir meaning. They are interpretable independently of these concepts\nand, further, their validity on the empirical level still provides the\nphysical content of the theory.\n\nA similar example is provided by special relativity, another theory of\nprinciple, which Einstein deliberately designed after the ideal of\nthermodynamics. Here, the empirical principles are the light postulate\nand the relativity principle. Again, once we have built up the modern\ntheoretical formalism of the theory (Minkowski space-time), it is\nstraightforward to prove the validity of these principles. But again\nthis does not count as an argument for claiming that they were no\nprinciples after all. So the question whether the term\n\u201cprinciple\u201d is justified for Heisenberg\u2019s relations,\nshould, in our view, be understood as the question whether they are\nconceived of as empirical principles.\n\nOne can easily show that this idea was never far from\nHeisenberg\u2019s intentions. We have already seen that Heisenberg\npresented the relations as the result of a \u201cpure fact of\nexperience\u201d. A few months after his 1927 paper, he wrote a\npopular paper \u201c\u00dcber die Grundprincipien der\nQuantenmechanik\u201d (\u201cOn the fundamental principles of\nquantum mechanics\u201d) where he made the point even more clearly.\nHere Heisenberg described his recent break-through in the\ninterpretation of the theory as follows: \u201cIt seems to be a\ngeneral law of nature that we cannot determine position and velocity\nsimultaneously with arbitrary accuracy\u201d. Now actually, and in\nspite of its title, the paper does not identify or discuss any\n\u201cfundamental principle\u201d of quantum mechanics. So, it must\nhave seemed obvious to his readers that he intended to claim that the\nuncertainty relation was a fundamental principle, forced upon us as an\nempirical law of nature, rather than a result derived from the\nformalism of the theory.\n\nThis reading of Heisenberg\u2019s intentions is corroborated by the\nfact that, even in his 1927 paper, applications of his relation\nfrequently present the conclusion as a matter of principle. For\nexample, he says \u201cIn a stationary state of an atom its phase is\nin principle indeterminate\u201d (Heisenberg 1927: 177,\n[emphasis added]). Similarly, in a paper of 1928, he described the\ncontent of his relations as: \n\n\nIt has turned out that it is in principle impossible to know,\nto measure the position and velocity of a piece of matter with\narbitrary accuracy. (Heisenberg 1984: 26, [emphasis added])\n\n\nSo, although Heisenberg did not originate the tradition of calling his\nrelations a principle, it is not implausible to attribute the view to\nhim that the uncertainty relations represent an empirical principle\nthat could serve as a foundation of quantum mechanics. In fact, his\n1927 paper expressed this desire explicitly: \n\n\nSurely, one would like to be able to deduce the quantitative laws of\nquantum mechanics directly from their anschaulich\nfoundations, that is, essentially, relation\n [(2)].\n (ibid: 196) \n\n\nThis is not to say that Heisenberg was successful in reaching this\ngoal, or that he did not express other opinions on other\noccasions.\n\nLet us conclude this section with three remarks. First, if the\nuncertainty relation is to serve as an empirical principle, one might\nwell ask what its direct empirical support is. In Heisenberg\u2019s\nanalysis, no such support is mentioned. His arguments concerned\nthought experiments in which the validity of the theory, at least at a\nrudimentary level, is implicitly taken for granted. Jammer (1974: 82)\nconducted a literature search for high precision experiments that\ncould seriously test the uncertainty relations and concluded they were\nstill scarce in 1974. Real experimental support for the uncertainty\nrelations in experiments in which the inaccuracies are close to the\nquantum limit have come about only more recently (see Kaiser, Werner,\nand George 1983; Uffink 1985; Nairz, Andt, and Zeilinger 2002).\n\nA second point is the question whether the theoretical structure or\nthe quantitative laws of quantum theory can indeed be derived on the\nbasis of the uncertainty principle, as Heisenberg wished. Serious\nattempts to build up quantum theory as a full-fledged Theory of\nPrinciple on the basis of the uncertainty principle have never been\ncarried out. Indeed, the most Heisenberg could and did claim in this\nrespect was that the uncertainty relations created \u201croom\u201d\n(Heisenberg 1927: 180) or \u201cfreedom\u201d (Heisenberg 1931: 43)\nfor the introduction of some non-classical mode of description of\nexperimental data, not that they uniquely lead to the formalism of\nquantum mechanics. A serious proposal to approach quantum mechanics as\na theory of principle was provided more recently by Bub (2000) and\nChiribella & Spekkens (2016). But, remarkably, this proposal does\nnot use the uncertainty relation as one of its fundamental principles.\nThird, it is remarkable that in his later years Heisenberg put a\nsomewhat different gloss on his relations. In his autobiography\nDer Teil und das Ganze of 1969 he described how he had found\nhis relations inspired by a remark by Einstein that \u201cit is the\ntheory which decides what one can observe\u201d\u2014thus giving\nprecedence to theory above experience, rather than the other way\naround. Some years later he even admitted that his famous discussions\nof thought experiments were actually trivial since \n\n\n\u2026 if the process of observation itself is subject to the laws\nof quantum theory, it must be possible to represent its result in the\nmathematical scheme of this theory.
