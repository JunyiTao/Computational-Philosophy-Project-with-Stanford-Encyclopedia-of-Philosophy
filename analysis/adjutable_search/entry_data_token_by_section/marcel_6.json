    "main_text": "Primary and Secondary Reflection\n7. Primary and Secondary Reflection\n\nThe distinction between two kinds of questions\u2014problem and\nmystery\u2014brings to light two different kinds of thinking or\nreflection. The problematic is addressed with thinking that is\ndetached and technical, while the mysterious is encountered in\nreflection that is involved, participatory and decidedly\nnon-technical. Marcel calls these two kinds of thinking\n\u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d reflection. Primary\nreflection examines its object by abstraction, by analytically\nbreaking it down into its constituent parts. It is concerned with\ndefinitions, essences and technical solutions to problems. In\ncontrast, secondary reflection is synthetic; it unifies rather than\ndivides. \u201cRoughly, we can say that where primary reflection\ntends to dissolve the unity of experience which is first put before\nit, the function of secondary reflection is essentially recuperative;\nit reconquers that unity\u201d (Marcel 1951a, p. 83).\n\nIn the most general sense, reflection is nothing other than attention\nbrought to bear on something. However, different objects require\ndifferent kinds of reflection. In keeping with their respective\napplication to problem and mystery, primary reflection is directed at\nthat which is outside of me or \u201cbefore me,\u201d while\nsecondary reflection is directed at that which is not merely before\nme\u2014that is, either that which is in me, which I am, or those\nareas where the distinctions \u201cin me\u201d and \u201cbefore\nme\u201d tend to break down. The parallels between having and being,\nproblem and mystery, and primary and secondary reflection are clear,\neach pair helping to illuminate the others.\n\nThus, secondary reflection is one important aspect of our access to\nthe self. It is the properly philosophical mode of reflection because,\nin Marcel\u2019s view, philosophy must return to concrete situations\nif it is to merit the name \u201cphilosophy.\u201d These difficult\nreflections are \u201cproperly philosophical\u201d insofar as they\nlead to a more truthful, more intimate communication with both myself\nand with any other person whom these reflections include (Marcel\n1951a, pp. 79\u201380). Secondary reflection, which recoups the unity\nof experience, points the way toward a fuller understanding of the\nparticipation alluded to in examples of the mysterious. Marcel\nargues that secondary reflection helps us to recover the experiences\nof the mysterious in human life. Secondary reflection is best\nunderstood as an act of critical reflection on primary reflection, and\nas a process of recovery of the \u201cmysteries of being.\u201d It\nbegins as the act of critical reflection (a \u201csecond\u201d\nreflection) on ordinary conceptual thinking (primary reflection). This\n\u201csecond\u201d or critical reflection enables the philosopher to\ndiscover that the categories of primary reflection are not adequate to\nprovide a true account of the nature of the self, or of the\nself\u2019s most profound experiences. Here secondary reflection\ninvolves ordinary reflection, but unlike ordinary reflection, it is a\ncritical reflection directed at the nature of thought itself. The act\nof secondary reflection then culminates in a discovery or in an\nassurance of the realm of mystery, and motivates human actions\nappropriate to this realm. This discovery is a kind of intuitive grasp\nor experiential insight into various experiences that are non\nconceptual, and that conceptual knowledge can never fully express\n(Sweetman, 2008, pp. 55-60). Marcel therefore develops the view that\nhuman beings are fundamentally beings-in-situations first, and then\nthinking or reflective beings second. Yet, in developing a critique of\nthe obsession with primary reflection (with the world of\n\u201chaving\u201d), he is not advocating any kind of relativism, or\neven suggesting that conceptual knowledge is not important; his aim is\nto illustrate where it fits into the analysis of the human subject,\nand to point out that it is important not to overstate its range or\nits value. In presenting these themes, Marcel wishes to do justice to,\nand to maintain the priority of, human subjectivity and individuality\nwhile at the same time avoiding the relativism and skepticism that has\ntended to accompany such notions. In this way, many of his admirers\nbelieve that he avoids the relativistic and skeptical excesses that\nhave plagued recent European thought since Heidegger and Sartre.\n\n",
