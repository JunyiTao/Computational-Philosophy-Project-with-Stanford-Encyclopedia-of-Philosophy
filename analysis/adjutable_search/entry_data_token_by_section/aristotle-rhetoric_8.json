    "main_text": "The Three Means of Persuasion\n5. The Three Means of Persuasion\n\nThe methodical core of Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric is the\ntheorem that there are three \u2018technical\u2019 pisteis,\ni.e. \u2018persuaders\u2019 or \u2018means of persuasion\u2019.\nPersuasion comes about either through the character\n(\u00eathos) of the speaker, the emotional state\n(pathos) of the hearer, or the argument (logos)\nitself. The structure of Rhetoric I & II & is\ndetermined by this tripartition (see\n \u00a7 2\n above). The attribute \u2018technical\u2019 seems to imply several\nthings: (i) Technical persuasion must rest on a method or art\n(techn\u00ea), and this, in turn, is to say that we must\nknow the reason why some things are persuasive and some are not. (ii)\nFurther, technical persuasion must rest on a complete analysis of what\nis possibly persuasive (see above\n \u00a7 4.1),\n and not on the random use of scattered persuasive factors. (iii)\nTechnical means of persuasion must be provided by the speakers\nthemselves and through the speech, whereas pre-existing facts, such as\noaths, witnesses, testimonies, etc. are non-technical, since they\ncannot be brought about by the speaker. (iv) Given that Aristotle\ncriticizes his predecessors, because they deal with non-technical\npersuasive devices instructing how to speak \u201coutside the\nsubject\u201d (see section\n \u00a7 4.4\n above), one might speculate whether the technical means of persuasion\nare required, vice versa, to actually address the things at\nissue.\n\nWhy just these three? And why only these three? Aristotle does not\ngive an elaborate defence of this tripartition. However, he says in a\ndifferent context that a speech consists of three things: the speaker,\nthe subject that is treated in the speech, and the listener to whom\nthe speech is addressed (Rhet. I.3, 1358a37ff.). Probably, he\nthinks that each of these three ingredients of a speech contributes to\npersuasion in a specific way, in that persuasion either flows from the\nperson of speaker, namely that he or she comes across as credible, or\nfrom the condition of the hearer, i.e. whether they are in an\nemotional state and which emotional state they are in or from the subject\nthat is treated in the speech, i.e. from the arguments or proofs that\nare meant to support a suggested point of view. Summarizing the\naccount of the three pisteis in a later section of the book,\nAristotle actually insists that there can be no other technical means\nof persuasion:\n\nIt has already been spoken about the means of persuasion\n(pisteis), from how many things they are, namely that they\nare from three things, and what kind of things these are, and why\nthere are only these three; for all people who are casting judgements\nare persuaded either because they themselves are affected, or because\nthey assume that the speakers are a certain kind of person or because\nsomething has been proven. (Rhet. III.1, 1403b10\u201313)\n\n",
