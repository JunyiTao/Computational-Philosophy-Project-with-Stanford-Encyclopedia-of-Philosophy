    "main_text": "Fair Equality of Opportunity\n6. Fair Equality of Opportunity\n\nOne prominent substantive conception of Equality of Opportunity which\naddresses factors such as the investment in sword skill tuition by\nparents in the wealthy social class is the one offered by John Rawls\nthat he labels Fair Equality of Opportunity (FEO). There are two\ncomponents to FEO. First, offices and positions are to be open to all\nin a formal sense under \u201ccareers open to talent\u201d, or, as\nit has been labelled above, the meritocratic conception (Rawls 1999:\n53, 57, 62). This is supplemented with the further requirement that\nall should have the fair chance to attain those offices and\npositions (Rawls 1999: 63; 2001: 43\u201344). A fair chance here\nmeans that\n\n\nthose who have the same level or talent and ability and the same\nwillingness to use these gifts should have the same prospects of\nsuccess regardless of their social class of origin. (Rawls 2001:\n44)\n\n\nIn other words, it is consistent with FEO that persons\u2019\nprospects for success vary depending on their levels of talent and\nabilities and their willingness to use them, however persons\u2019\nsocial class should not differentially affect those prospects (see\nalso Miller 1996).\n\nRawls\u2019s FEO is substantive by way of taking account of the\nbackground conditions which differentially affect persons\u2019\nrespective chances of fulfilling the meritocratic selection criteria.\nFEO does not obtain when social class structure results in persons\nfrom some social classes facing diminished prospects for obtaining the\nskills and qualifications necessary to compete on relevantly equal\nterms with others. For instance, if children from less privileged\nsocial backgrounds face lower quality education which results in\nlesser prospects for developing the skills and self-discipline to\ncompete for rewarding jobs, FEO fails to obtain, even though selection\nfor those jobs is based on meritocratic criteria. In this context,\nincome inequalities between social classes and the education system,\nbroadly construed, are plausibly important factors in determining how\nfar persons face relevantly equal prospects.\n\nOn its face, Rawls\u2019s FEO is a simple idea. Talent and effort are\nappropriate criteria for success in the competition for socially\nadvantageous positions and roles, but differences in social class\nbackground should neither directly influence the competition, nor\nindirectly influence how far persons can develop talent or make an\neffort. That simplicity belies many further complications, however\n(for a forthright critique see Arneson 1999).\n\nFirst, Rawls frames FEO as opposing the unequal effects of\n\u201csocial class\u201d (Rawls 1999: 63). At other times, Rawls\npresents FEO as addressing differences in \u201cincome class\u201d\n(Rawls 1999: 270). He also uses the term \u201csectors in\nsociety\u201d to seemingly refer to the same idea (Rawls 1999: 63).\nIt is not clear whether Rawls intends these different terms to be\nequivalent. After all, one can in principle envisage a society in\nwhich income levels are all equal and yet a social class system of\nsome form exists, whereby there is a hierarchy of rank and status and\ncitizens in the upper echelons enjoy social goods and opportunities\nunrelated to income (for some discussion of the relation between\nmaterial inequality and social inequality, see B. Barry 1998; Wolff\n2017). If only income class differences are objectionable\ninfluences on persons\u2019 opportunities under FEO, then this social\nhierarchy is unobjectionable, even if it has a profound effect on the\nchances different persons have to compete for social positions. A\nsensible reading of Rawls takes him to understand social class to\ninclude income differences without being exhausted by such\ndifferences. This, of course, raises the further question of what is\nto count as a \u201csocial class\u201d or \u201csocial\nsector\u201d based inequality.\n\nThe focus on social class specifically also makes FEO appear\nrelatively narrow. Insofar as FEO holds that social class should not\naffect persons\u2019 prospects to succeed, it seems to imply that\nunequal prospects within social classes are unobjectionable.\nFor instance, if children from rich backgrounds generally receive a\nbetter education which gives them a substantial advantage in the job\nmarket, this would be clearly incompatible with FEO. However, consider\nthe case where this is not true as a general matter but simply that\nonly some rich families invest heavily in their\nchildren\u2019s education such that only that subset of children from\nrich backgrounds have substantial advantages. Alternatively, in a\nstill more contrived example, suppose that social class is completely\nuncorrelated with public educational development and that state\neducation is equalized across society but that particular families,\nrandomly distributed across different social classes, invest heavily\nin their children\u2019s education to give them a competitive\nadvantage in later life. In both instances, the inequalities in\nprospects do not appear to be objectionable under FEO if FEO is\nunderstood to object to inequalities resulting from social\nclass. However, if FEO is designed to ensure a fair chance to\nobtain jobs and positions and this means, in Rawls\u2019s terms,\n\u201cthat those with similar abilities and skills should have\nsimilar life chances\u201d (Rawls 1999: 63), then it seems that these\nother non-class-based inequalities should also be deemed\nobjectionable.\n\nSecond, it might be argued that there is a tension inherent in FEO. On\nthe one hand social class inequality is considered to be an\ninappropriate source of competitive advantage. On the other hand,\nunder FEO, differences in talent and effort are appropriate\ncriteria for competitive selection for jobs. And yet, it is natural to\nsuppose that social class affects the development of talent and has an\nimpact on how much effort people are willing to make (Anderson 2004;\nElford 2016; Swift & Marshall 1997; for related discussion see\nChambers 2009: 379\u2013381). One option to avoid this tension would\nbe to say that differences in native talent and\nnative disposition to make an effort are appropriate\ndeterminants of success in competition for social advantage. So even\nthough developed levels of talent and effort will differ due to social\nclass influences, we should select for jobs based on the native\ncharacteristics. The problem, here, is that it is not clear whether\nnative talent and native disposition to make an effort pick out\nanything especially socially significant (Anderson 2004), or\nstraightforwardly measurable. And this seems to be a radical departure\nfrom most ways of understanding what makes a candidate\n\u201cbest-qualified\u201d under the meritocratic element of FEO. A\ntall, well-coordinated and exceptionally athletic person might have\nvery high native talent for becoming a basketball player, but if they\nhave not spent any of their life developing a talent for basketball\nthey are hardly more \u201cwell-qualified\u201d for team selection\nthan someone with less native talent but who has otherwise much more\nadvanced skill at basketball. In short, it seems to be talent and\neffort at the more developed end (or at least with enough remaining\npotential to be developed) which seem to matter under the meritocratic\nconception, and yet the \u201cfair chance\u201d element of FEO seems\nto hold that it is inappropriate for those with superior developed\ntalent to have an advantage in the competition for positions when the\nsuperiority of that talent is the result of social class factors\n(James Fishkin 1983: 30\u201332).\n\nA third complication when thinking about FEO is that social class\ncleavages might reflect factors which account for unequal\nopportunities without it being straightforwardly the case that social\nclass directly causes those unequal opportunities. Suppose social\nclass stratification is well-correlated with later success in the\ncompetition for jobs, such that social class is a strong predictor for\njob market success. As illustrated above, one typical way in which\nsocial class might result in unfair chances to compete for socially\nadvantageous positions is by giving children from privileged social\nclasses better education, broadly construed, in order to give them a\nbetter prospect at becoming the best qualified. Consider a possible\nalternative explanation of the correlation. It could be the case that\nthere is a higher level of native talent in the more\nadvantaged social class and very little inter-class mixing, such that\ncitizens in the advantaged social class only tend to meet, partner up\nwith, and bear children with fellow members of the same social class.\nPerhaps this results in native talent levels being inherited by the\nchildren born in that same social class, leading to the same process\ncontinuing. In that way, the high native talent levels are\nself-perpetuating and the lack of inter-class mixing results in the\ncorrelation between social class and job market success continuing\nover time. The question is what should FEO say about this? Social\nclass position is a strong predictor of job market success, but not\nbecause social class factors influence the development of talent and\neffort. Of course, it could still be said that social class plays a\nformative role in the relationship between social class and job market\nsuccess precisely because social class norms and expectations shape\nand condition the degree of inter-class mixing in the society. So, the\nresulting stratification of talent and effort along class lines is not\nitself independent of the operation of social class. Still, although\nsocial class is a part of the explanation for the inequalities in the\ncompetition for social positions, the role it plays seems importantly\ndifferent. In this case social class does not directly influence the\ndevelopment of talent and effort for children who already\nexist\u2014by way of greater educational resources for some children\nover others, for instance\u2014but, rather, social class determines\nwhich children are born in which social classes to begin with.\n\nA further case in which social class and the development of talent\nmight be connected is in the development of native talent\nduring gestation. For instance, if pregnant women from less advantaged\nsocial classes lack the means for adequate nutrition, this may affect\nthe \u201cnative talent\u201d of the children they bear. In that\nsense social class might differentially affect a child\u2019s\nprospects in the competition for socially advantageous position even\nbefore birth, and not simply by way of post-birth education and\ndevelopment (B. Barry 2005: 47\u201350; Kollar & Loi 2015; Loi,\nDel Savio, & Stupka 2013).\n\nFourth, as with formal equality of opportunity, FEO does not itself\naddress which rewards ought to be attached to the different roles and\npositions (although other parts of Rawls\u2019 theory constrain\npermissible inequalities). As a consequence, it\u2019s possible that,\nunder FEO, winning or losing in the competition for certain social\npositions will have substantial implications for one\u2019s later\nopportunities. The clearest illustration of this are the opportunities\nafforded in later life through success in the education system.\nSuccess in the competition for school and university places results in\nthe development of merit and the enhancement of qualifications for\nthose successful candidates, which in turn gives them advantages when\nit comes to the competition for desirable social roles and positions.\nThe cycle continues where success in that later competition for entry\nlevel social roles can similarly offer advantages in competition for\nfurther social roles. Success within the education system can thereby\nset some those successful candidates on a pathway towards a range of\nsubsequent opportunities whilst cleaving away unsuccessful candidates\nto a position of disadvantage, unable to compete for a range of roles\nand positions for which success in an earlier competition in education\nwas required. And yet, this is apparently consistent with FEO,\nprovided all individuals enjoyed a relevantly fair chance to compete\non the basis of merit for those earlier opportunities in education.\nJoseph Fishkin (2014) labels this type of structure of opportunities a\n\u201cbottleneck\u201d and commends a mechanism of\n\u201copportunity pluralism\u201d to address it. Under opportunity\npluralism there are a larger number of pathways over the course of\npersons\u2019 lives to successfully compete for different goods,\nrather than a narrower route to securing those goods through success\nin a limited range of competitions earlier in life (Joseph Fishkin\n2014: ch. 3). Similarly, Jacobs (2004) argues that a defensible\nconception of Equality of Opportunity ought to regulate the rewards\nand losses (the \u201cstakes\u201d) in competitions for role and\npositions and both broaden the distribution of opportunities to gain\nas well as limit the degree to which individuals can gain and lose in\neach competition.\n\nA fifth complication again relates to the potential narrowness of FEO\nas Rawls states the idea. Social class is typically understood to\nrelate to a stratification of persons along a rough cluster of social\nand economic dimensions. In that sense it is different from other ways\nin which people might be grouped together and face disadvantages as\nmembers of a group. It is different, for example, from racialized\ngroup membership, gender, and sex. Insofar as FEO addresses only\nsocial class disadvantages, rather than these other potential\nsources of unfair disadvantages, it might be thought to fail to\naddress other factors which undermine meaningful Equality of\nOpportunity (Wolff 2017). For instance, although direct race, gender,\nand sex discrimination in hiring is ruled out under FEO (by dint of\nthe requirement that positions be \u201copen to all\u201d),\nracialized group membership, gender, and sex might be a source of\nunfair disadvantage in less direct ways (Rawls 1999: 129\u2013130).\nSusan Moller Okin (1989) argues, for example, that the gendered\nstructure of the family is a major obstacle to Equality of Opportunity\nfor women and girls, particularly because women are usually the\nprimary caregivers for children. The unequal share of household labour\nundercuts Equality of Opportunity for women, both within and outside\nthe family unit itself, given that women\u2019s opportunities for\neconomic success and attainment of political office are so constrained\nby what is required of them in the home (Okin 1989: 116, 123; for\ndiscussion of some of the measures which might be taken to equalize\nopportunities between men and women in relation to this, see Bergmann\n2008; Brighouse & Wright 2008; Gheaus & Robeyns 2011; Gornick\n& Meyers 2008).\n\nThere are at least four mechanisms by which such factors might affect\nhow far people enjoy meaningfully equal opportunities. First, societal\nfactors related to racialized group membership and gender might\ninfluence the development of the talents relevant for selection under\nthe meritocratic conception. For instance, suppose conceptions of\nchildren\u2019s aptitude for certain subjects in schools are\nprejudiced on racialized or gender lines, resulting in members of some\nracialized groups or one gender being disproportionately streamed into\nclasses where the quality of education is lower. In this case, their\nprospects for future success in the job market are diminished by\nfactors other than social class. Second, societal factors other than\nsocial class might be thought to affect the development of ambition\nand the disposition to make an effort. Take a society where\nconceptions of race and gender are socially salient, and\nchildren\u2019s pursuit of career paths tends to be heavily\ninfluenced by whether or not they see others with the same racialized\nor gender characteristics succeeding in those vocations. Children\nmight simply fail to recognize a vocation as a possible path\n\u201cfor someone like them\u201d if there are very few others\nsucceeding in that vocation who share their characteristics. In this\nway, it might be argued that factors other than social class can\ndampen ambition and effort-making dispositions in ways that undercut\nmeaningful equal opportunity for certain jobs and roles. Third, there\nmight be certain social constraints on participation in the\ncompetition for socially advantageous positions that are\nnon-developmental but reflect more general norms and expectations\nconcerning who should apply for jobs and what a person has to\nsacrifice to do so (Phillips 2006). For instance, dominant social\nexpectations concerning women\u2019s role as primary caregivers might\nbe thought to constrain equal opportunity for participation in the\nlabour market beyond the household. Fourth, and relatedly, as noted\nabove in\n section 5,\n because FEO leaves open what constitutes a talent, a scheme of FEO\nmight, in principle, leave in place systematic disadvantages for\nmembers of certain groups. For instance, even if there is no direct\nsex-based discrimination against women in employment selection, a lack\nof workplace accommodation for leave during pregnancy, and measures\ndesigned to ensure that such absence is not disadvantageous, might be\nconsidered indirect discrimination against women. To address such\npotential sources of inequality, it might be argued that FEO should be\nbroadened (Miller 2013: 122\u2013123, although Miller is skeptical\nthat Rawls can accommodate all of the inequality upsetting effects of\nfamily life). Under such an adapted version of FEO, then, enjoyment of\na \u201cfair chance\u201d to develop the talent and effort required\nfor success in the competition for role and offices must take account\nof factors beyond \u201csocial class\u201d. Which factors do and do\nnot undermine a \u201cfair chance\u201d will, of course, be a matter\nof further debate between different conceptions of FEO thus\nconstrued.\n",
