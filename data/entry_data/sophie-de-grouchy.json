    "preamble": "\n\nSophie de Grouchy (1764\u20131822) was a French philosopher whose\nbook The Letters on Sympathy offers clear and original\nperspectives on a number of important moral, political, and legal\nphilosophical issues. As well as this book, which she published\ntogether with her translation of Smiths\u2019s The Theory of\nMoral Sentiments in 1798, Grouchy wrote and published other texts\npseudonomously and anonymously. In particular, Grouchy published\narticles defending republicanism and participated in the writing and\nediting of her husband\u2019s (Condorcet) last work, the Sketch\nof Human Progress. Unfortunately her work remained in the shadow\nfor many years. The fact that it is now coming to be known in the\nphilosophical community is a function of the general effort in the\nlast twenty years to recover work by women philosophers of the past.\nGrouchy is particularly relevant to philosophers working on (feminist)\nrepublicanism, eighteenth century philosophy, Adam Smith, and social\nand legal philosophy.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nMarie-Louise-Sophie de Grouchy, Marquise de Condorcet was born in 1764\nat the Chateau de Meulan. She died in 1822 of an unknown disease. Her\nparents were Marie Gilberte Henriette Fr\u00e9teau de P\u00e9ny\nand Francois-Jacques, Marquis de Grouchy. She was the eldest of four.\nHer sister, Charlotte, married Grouchy\u2019s close friend and\ncollaborator, Pierre-Georges Cabanis. One of her two brothers,\nEmmanuel de Grouchy, Marshall under Napoleon, was reputedly\nresponsible for the French losing at Waterloo because he chose to\nfinish a dish of strawberries before answering a call to battle.\n\nGrouchy was educated at home, benefiting from her brothers\u2019\ntutors and her highly cultured mother\u2019s teachings. At eighteen,\nshe was sent to the Chanoinesse school of Neuville, a convent\nfinishing school for the very rich. There she continued her studies,\nreading Rousseau and Voltaire and learning English and Italian by\ntranslating texts by Edward Young and Torquato Tasso. This is also\nwhere she became an atheist.\n\nAt the age of 22, she married Nicolas, Marquis de Condorcet,\nmathematician and philosopher, who held the post of officer of the\nmint under Turgot. Together they moved to the Hotel of the Mint in\nParis, and there they started a salon, hosting members of the\npolitical and literary international scene.\n\nIn 1791, together with Condorcet, Thomas Paine, the Girondin Brissot,\nand a few others, she started a journal designed to raise awareness of\nrepublican political thought in France. This journal, Le\nR\u00e9publicain, only lasted a few months as Condorcet\ndemanded it be discontinued after the Champ de Mars massacre, at which\nGrouchy and her daughter, Eliza, born in 1790, had been present.\n\nGrouchy contributed several pieces to that publication (unsigned or\nsigned \u201cLa V\u00e9rit\u00e9\u201d\u2014Truth) and she also\ntranslated others by Paine. It was probably around that time that\nGrouchy wrote the first draft of her Letters on Sympathy, a\nresponse to and commentary on Adam Smith\u2019s The Theory of\nMoral Sentiments.\n\nIn 1793, Condorcet was added to a list of men and women who were\n\u201cproscribed\u201d by the government of the Terror and had to go\ninto hiding to evade arrest. Condorcet remained in hiding until spring\nof 1794 when he attempted to run and died under an assumed name in a\nsmall town outside Paris. During his time in hiding, he completed the\nintroduction to a encyclopedic work on the progress of humanity which\nhe had started several decades earlier. There is evidence that Grouchy\nhelped him with this work during her frequent visits. At the very\nleast, she edited an incomplete manuscript, adding several passages\nwhich were deleted by a later editor.\n\nAfter Condorcet\u2019s death, Grouchy, whose wealth had been\nconfiscated, lived by painting miniature portraits. By the time the\nTerror was over, she decided to publish her Letters on\nSympathy, addressed to her her brother-in-law, Cabanis, together\nwith a translation of Adam Smith\u2019s The Theory of Moral\nSentiments which greatly surpassed existing translations.\n\nFrom 1795 until her death in 1822, she dedicated her writing time to\nediting her husband\u2019s works. She continued to participate in\nFrance\u2019s philosophical life through her salon and kept in\nregular touch with Cabanis who worked on physiology and later,\nStoicism.\n2. Enlightenment and Revolution\n\nGrouchy was very much a product of the Enlightenment ideas that\ninfluenced the French Revolution. As a teenager, she gave up religion\nand embraced Voltaire, Rousseau, and social justice. Her salon was the\nheart of the revolutionary faction that had the most contact with\nforeigners such as Thomas Paine. She was also, through Brissot,\nclosely connected to the Girondins, and through him and her husband,\nCondorcet, to the French abolitionist movement. Although she did not\nherself write about women\u2019s rights, it is not unlikely that she\nhad some influence over her husband\u2019s short piece on this\nsubject written in 1790: \u201cOn the Right of Women to the\nCity\u201d.\n2.1 Enlightenment Philosophy and the French Revolution\n\nThe Revolution was a time when philosophers came into the limelight,\nbooks inspired acts and reforms, and the words of Rousseau, Voltaire,\nAdam Smith, Thomas Paine and the Marquis de Condorcet were (at least\nfor some time) authoritative. But it\u2019s important to note that\nsome of the philosophers who influenced the ideals and the course of\nthe French Revolution were women. Sophie de Grouchy was one of\nthem.\n\nVoltaire and Rousseau were almost universally\ninfluential\u2014everyone who could read had heard of them, and while\nsome preferred one to the other, both figured in the collective\nimagination as a model for thinking social and political reforms.\nGrouchy had read both at convent school and Voltaire had been\nCondorcet\u2019s friend and mentor. Unfortunately, his acquaintance\nwith Voltaire began after the death of Voltaire\u2019s partner,\nphilosopher Emilie du Chatelet, which meant that there was no direct\nconnection between her and Grouchy.\n\nThe main external influences for late eighteenth century French\nRevolutionary philosophers were Adam Smith and Thomas Paine.\nSmith\u2019s Wealth of Nations had been a huge success in\nFrance and his economic thought was particularly influential for\nTurgot, France\u2019s finance minister before Necker, and Condorcet,\nofficer of the mint. Condorcet offered a copy of his Life of\nTurgot to Smith. While Smith and Turgot seem to have developed\ntheir theory of economics independently, there was certainly some\ncorrespondence between the two at a later stage.\n\nThomas Paine spent much of the period of the French Revolution in\nParis, and he was a good friend of the\nCondorcets\u2014Grouchy\u2019s command of English must have been\npart of the reason why he liked them, but also the couple and their\nfriends favored an American style of republicanism and Paine\u2019s\nknowledge and ideas were very useful in helping define what that\nmeant. Paine played a key role in the founding of the journal Le\nR\u00e9publicain, providing several pieces, which were almost\ncertainly translated by Grouchy.\n2.2 Saloni\u00e8res\n\nAlthough Grouchy was a philosopher who participated fully in the\nintellectual debates of her time\u2014including those that led to\npolitical reforms\u2014her status was never quite the same as that of\nher male counterparts because she was a woman.\n\nThe women who had any influence of the political life of the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries are very often dubbed\n\u201csaloni\u00e8res\u201d. In other words, they were hostesses,\nwhose job was to make sure that the men who came to share important\nphilosophical insight in their home did not go about with an empty\nglass. Famous saloni\u00e8res of the French Revolution include\nMadame Helvetius, widow of the philosopher of that name, Madame de\nStael, Madame Roland, wife of the Girondin minister of the interior,\nand Sophie de Grouchy. Although these women were hostesses, their\nmotivation for hosting was perhaps as much the desire to be part of\nthe debate as to facilitate it. It was easier for a woman to talk\npolitics in her own home than anywhere else. Although women could\nattend men\u2019s clubs\u2014at least until 1793\u2014and the\nAssembly, they could only listen. Several of the saloni\u00e8res of\nthe revolution became writers of note, including Madame Roland, Madame\nde Stael, and Sophie de Grouchy. Unfortunately, historians of the\nrevolution, starting with Michelet but continuing to these days,\nensured that they only became famous as hostesses rather than as the\nthinkers and writers they were.\n2.3 The Gironde\n\nOne faction of the Revolution that was particularly welcoming to women\nwas the Gironde. This was in part at least because their unofficial\nleader, Brissot, found it easy to admire and respect women\u2019s\nintellect. He had known Catharine Macaulay in England and been\ninstrumental in her republican History of England being\ntranslated to French. He was a close friend and correspondent of Manon\nRoland and had published (anonymously, following her wishes) several\nof her reflections on the Revolution in his paper Le Patriote\nFrancois. Brissot was also a close friend and collaborator of\nfellow editor Louise Keralio-Robert. It was he who convinced the\nFrench Theatre to put on Olympe de Gouges\u2019s abolitionist play,\nZamore and Mirza, and then invited her to join his Society of\nFriends of the Black. He was also on the editorial board of Le\nR\u00e9publicain, and advertised it in Le\nPatriote.\n\nCondorcet was strongly implicated in the Girondist party by February\n1793 as he drafted the Gironde\u2019s constitutional project. In July\n1793, a list of 21 \u201cproscribed\u201d Girondins was issued, and\n39 names (including Condorcet\u2019s) were added shortly afterwards.\nBrissot and twenty-one others were arrested. They were tried on 24\nOctober and executed on the last day of that month. It took just over\nhalf an hour for the twenty-two heads to fall. Others who had escaped,\nincluding Manon Roland\u2019s husband (the interior minister\nJean-Marie Roland) and her lover (the politician Fran\u00e7ois\nBuzot) committed suicide shortly afterwards. After several months\nspent in hiding in Paris, Condorcet too attempted to escape. He died\nin prison in Bourg-la-Reine in March 1795, either by swallowing poison\nhidden for him in a ring by his brother in law Cabanis or from a heart\nattack brought on by his long walk from Paris.\n\nMany of the projects began by the Gironde were more or less given up\nby those who came after, including the abolition of slavery and the\nemancipation of women.\n3. Works\n\nSophie de Grouchy only published one book in her own name: a short\ntext entitled Huit Lettres sur la Sympathie translated as\nThe Letters on Sympathy, which she appended to her\ntranslation of two texts by Adam Smith: The Theory of Moral\nSentiments and The Origins of Language. We do, however,\nhave evidence that she wrote other texts. Grouchy edited a republican\njournal with her husband in 1791 and there are two articles that,\nalthough unsigned, can be attributed to her. She also contributed\ntranslations and articles by Thomas Paine to the journal, and later\npublished her own translation of Adam Smith\u2019s works. There is\nalso evidence of some unpublished (and possibly unfinished) work,\nwhich Condorcet refers to in a letter to his daughter.\n3.1 The Letters on Sympathy\n\nThe Letters on Sympathy were first drafted in 1791 or 1792,\nbut published in 1798 alongside a translation of Smith\u2019s\nTheory of Moral Sentiment and Origins of Language.\nAccording to Grouchy\u2019s daughter, Grouchy decided to translate\nSmith because she needed money. It also provided her with the\nopportunity to publish her own response to Smith. She ensured that it\ndid not get mistaken for a simple introduction by printing it at the\nend of the translations, rather than the beginning.\n\nGrouchy is enthusiastic about Smith\u2019s views\u2014she agrees\nwith him that moral sentiments and judgments can be derived from\nsympathy and that we need to develop our rational abilities in order\nto render this capacity useful. But she takes issue with certain\naspects of those views. In particular, she feels that he has not dug\nsufficiently deep in order to understand what sympathy is. He has\nnoted \u201cits existence, and its principal effects\u201d, but not\ngone back to \u201cits first cause, showing how it must belong to all\nsensible beings capable of reflection\u201d (Letter I, p.3). This\nfirst cause she traces back to infanthood, and to the very physical\nrelationship of a baby with its nurse. Grouchy does not talk about\nmothers there. She is careful to distinguish between the physical\nrelationship, skin on skin, feeding, and the moral one, the duty a\nmother may have to nurture her children, and the duties of the\nchildren to love and respect their mother. In that she differs from\nManon Roland and Mary Wollstonecraft who thought that an infant needed\nto be fed by his own mother in order to flourish morally. What Grouchy\nis looking for is a physical trigger to the sensations of pleasure and\npain that will eventually give rise to sentiments of sympathy, and\nthis trigger has to be common to all human beings in order to account\nfor the ubiquitous presence of sympathy in human societies. Every baby\nthat survives to an age where they may develop sentiments will have\nbeen fed by another human, and there will have been no previous\nuniversal experience suited to stimulate the sensations that can lead\nto these sentiments. Grouchy not only traces sympathy back to its\norigins, but her account is distinctly naturalistic. This cashes out\nin her description of the growth of sympathy and the birth of\nmorality.\n\nThe text takes the form of eight letters, addressed to C***. Although\nsome readers have conjectured that C*** was her husband, Condorcet,\nthere is evidence that the letters are addressed to her\nbrother-in-law, close friend and collaborator Pierre-George Cabanis.\nCabanis shared an interest with Grouchy on the role of physiology in\nhuman behavior and morality, as well as in social reforms.\n\nThe eight letters function like chapters and take the reader through\nthe argument, which starts with the origins of sympathy, and end with\nthe application of the theory developed to social, legal and political\nreform. Although the format is epistolary, there is no question that\nthese are not real letters but chapters of a short treatise. The\nargument sustained throughout the text and the addresses to C*** at\nthe beginning and at the end serve as transition passages from one\npart of the argument to the other.\n\nThe first letter explains how the author is going to depart from\nSmith\u2019s own argument. Smith, she says, has merely postulated\nsympathy as a human disposition, but what is needed in order to\nunderstand more fully the workings of sympathy is an inquiry into its\norigins. She then goes on to argue that these origins are\nphysiological in nature, arising from an infant\u2019s first human,\nskin on skin contact (with her nurse) and the discovery of pleasure\nand pain. The next two letters offer a theory of the development of\nsympathy through reason, showing how we extend our sympathy to a\ngreater circle as we develop, and distinguishing between different\nsorts of sympathies. Letters IV and V offer an account of the origins\nof morality out of sympathy, in which the author mostly agrees with\nSmith. In the final three letters Grouchy explores the implications of\nher theory for the legal, social, economic and political reforms\ncalled for, and made possible, by the French Revolution.\n3.2 Political Journalism and Translations\n\nLe R\u00e9publicain, edited by the founding members of the\nSociety of the same name (Condorcet, Brissot, Paine, Duchatelet,\nDumont, and Sophie de Grouchy) lasted for four issues in the\nspring/summer 1791. Grouchy seems to have been quite involved in the\nproduction of the journal. In the first issue, she translated two\npieces by Thomas Paine (one of which is signed Duchastellet, despite\nhaving been written by Paine). The third piece in that first issue is\nsigned \u201cLa V\u00e9rit\u00e9\u201d (Truth) which featured as\na signature on Grouchy\u2019s stationary. Stylistically, it appears\nto have been a collaboration between Grouchy and Condorcet. Its\nargument is a justification of the revolution to foreigners, an\nexplanation of how the republican principles it embodied contribute to\nfreeing the people of France and how they will, at the right time, do\nthe same for other countries. The main piece of the second issue is\nthe first half of a long paper discussing a letter written by Louis\nXVI to the people of France before his attempted escape. It offers a\nrepublican analysis of the pitfalls of monarchy, even when the monarch\nin question is not a tyrant. The article was first drafted by Dumont,\nbut he later withdrew it and it was significantly rewritten using\narguments, phrases and style that can be found in the Letters on\nSympathy. The third issue contains the end of that article,\nanother letter by Paine, translated by Grouchy, and a short piece\nentitled \u201cLetter from a Young Mechanic\u201d which is unsigned\nbut attributed to Grouchy in which the fictional mechanical inventor\nwho is a student of Vaucanson proposes that the royal family be\nreplaced by a set of automata. Even though such machines are\nexpensive, it says, they will cost a fraction of what the French\npeople are spending on their actual king. And what\u2019s more, the\nmechanical king, far from being a tyrant, will raise its pen and sign\neverything its government wants it to! Jacques Vaucanson, the putative\nteacher of the fictional author was a famous inventor, and one whose\ninventions Condorcet had praised in his works as an example of the\nsort of technical activity that could be just as inspirational as\ntheories (Condorcet, Oeuvres, 413\u2013437, and Belhoste\n1994: 127).\n\nA recurrent theme both in the \u201cLetter from a Young\nMechanic\u201d and \u201cObservations on the King\u2019s\nLetter\u201d is the financial cost of maintaining a royal family.\nGrouchy, who had lived for some years in the Hotel de Monnaies while\nCondorcet was the inspector general of the Monnaie de Paris under\nNecker, had some knowledge of economics. Condorcet himself advocated a\nliberal economy, much closer to his previous superior, Turgot, a\nPhysiocrat who believed in a laisser-faire economy. Together Turgot\nand Condorcet had attempted in 1774 to solve the problem of the\ngrowing price of bread by letting the farmers decide how they sold\ntheir flour, instead of controlling the market. Unfortunately their\nreform was followed by a drought and later severe hail storms so that\nwhatever grain had managed to push through the dry soil was destroyed\nbecause it could not be harvested. The king, rather than following\nNecker\u2019s advice and waiting for his reforms to have their\neffect\u2014after all no amount of reform could change the\nweather\u2014sacked Turgot and gave his job to Necker. This did\nnothing to prevent the people from starving and France found itself in\nthe midst of the \u201cflour wars\u201d with riots in Paris and\npillages in the countryside by people who could no longer afford to\nbuy bread, or who spent their entire income on it, leaving nothing for\nclothes or housing. The final issue of the journal contains a long\nessay on the creation of an electoral council, a piece later reprinted\nas part of Condorcet\u2019s works.\n\nIn 1798, Grouchy published a two volume translation of Adam\nSmith\u2019s The Theory of Moral Sentiments and A\nDissertation on the Origins of Languages. Her translation was\nnotable in that it was based on the seventh (1792) and most\nauthoritative edition of Smiths\u2019s work. Also, unlike previous\ntranslators of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Grouchy\nfollowed the text closely, without summarizing, interpreting, adding,\nor deleting parts. Her translation remained in print until the late\ntwentieth century.\n3.3 The Sketch of Human Progress\n\nIn 1794, while Condorcet was in hiding, Grouchy advised him to work on\nthe introduction of his unfinished history of human progress. There is\nevidence that the couple worked closely together at that time.\nMoreover, there are discrepancies between the final manuscript in\nCondorcet\u2019s hand, and the first published version, edited and\nintroduced by Grouchy. There are notable passages added that deal with\nthe role of women and families in the evolution of humanity. On the\nfirst page of the first part, \u201cMen united into hordes\u201d,\nCondorcet writes that human groups are always family based and this is\nbecause mothers and fathers have a natural tendency to form strong\nemotional attachments towards their children:\n\n\nA family society seems to be natural to man. Its origin is to be found\nin the child\u2019s need for its parents and in the natural\nsolicitude of the mother and\u2014though to a lesser extent\u2014of\nthe father for their offspring. But the child\u2019s need lasts long\nenough to bring into existence and foster a desire to perpetuate this\nlife together and to awaken a lively sense of its advantages. A family\nthat lived in a region offering ready means of subsistence could\nincrease and become a tribe. (Lukes and Urbinati 2012: 9)\n\n\nThese passages were deleted in a later edition by Fran\u00e7ois\nArago who preferred to see them as inauthentic than as the product of\na collaboration between Condorcet and Grouchy.\n\nCondorcet\u2019s discussion of the importance of the family for human\nsociety in these first paragraphs does not lead, as one might expect,\nto further discussion of how the family develops, and how it\ninfluences the progress of humanity. But in Grouchy\u2019s 1795\nedition, the idea that studying families is important in order to\nunderstand human progress is reintroduced in the last pages\n(Condorcet, 1795, p.322):\n\n\nUntil now, political history, as indeed, the history of philosophy and\nof science has always been the history of a few men. But what the\nhuman species actually consists in, the families, subsisting nearly\nentirely from their labor, has been forgotten.(my translation)\n\n\nA history of families, Grouchy and Condorcet conclude, is what we need\nto study in order to truly understand human progress because focusing\non isolated individuals, exceptionally bred royalty, or heroes whose\npaths are exceptional, cannot give us an accurate picture of how\nhumanity in general changed through the ages.\n\nIf we take into account the influence of Sophie de Grouchy as his\ncollaborator, we can interpret this framing of the work with\nconsiderations about family life as hers. It does give the work a\ndistinctly proto-feminist flavor of the kind that goes beyond\nCondorcet\u2019s principles. Focusing on the family and its\nimportance for human development is crucial to the proper integration\nof women into the history of humanity and to make their lives central\nto any plans for future progress. Not only does it allow us to look\nbeyond the odd, isolated woman who against all historical odds\nsucceeded in asserting herself at the top of some discipline or other,\nbut it also reminds men that they have a life and a set of duties\nwithin the family unit, that they are not free individuals moving\nhistory along with the sheer force of their courage or intellect, but\nfathers who need to change a nappy and help their daughters with their\nhomework so that they too have a chance at participating in human\nprogress.\n3.4 Other Writings\n\nWe have evidence that Grouchy wrote other texts beside those listed in\nthe previous sections. In his 1794 \u201cAdvice to his\ndaughter\u201d, Condorcet refers to texts and fragments by his wife,\nbesides the eight letters on sympathy, dealing with moral philosophy.\nIn 1792 Grouchy wrote to Etienne Dumont to ask him to read a draft of\nthe Letters and the beginning of a philosophical novel. The\nfragments have not been found so far, and it is possible that they\nwere destroyed.\n4. Philosophy\n\nThe Letters on Sympathy, where the greatest part of\nGrouchy\u2019s philosophy is to be found, are principally a response\nto Smith\u2019s Theory of Moral Sentiments. The author\nstates in the first letter that her writing was prompted by reading\nSmith\u2019s book, and that where she disagreed with him, she wanted\nto develop her own views and arguments. Later in that letter she says\nwhat specifically she disagrees with: Smith does not investigate the\norigins of sympathy, and hence his account of its effects must be\nincomplete. Elsewhere in the Letters she specifies aspects of\nher argument where she either agrees or disagrees with Smith.\n\nGrouchy is also writing in the context of the French revolution, and\nattempting, with her husband, to help bring about a number of reforms\nin France. This means that her philosophy is mostly focused on value\ntheory\u2014specifically moral, social, legal, economic and political\ntheory.\n\nTheoretical influences come from philosophers who turned to psychology\nand cognitive development such as Locke and Condillac. As far as\npolitical philosophy was concerned, we find influences from Voltaire\nand Rousseau, but also Fenelon and Montesquieu.\n\nA further influence must be noted, that of her choice of\ncorrespondent, C***. Jean-George Cabanis was a medical doctor by\ntraining, but also a writer who attempted to combine his scientific\nknowledge with moral and social philosophy. His main work, On the\nrelations between the physical and moral aspects of man in 1802\ndescribes the effects that physiology has on moral\npsychology\u2014character, he says, is inevitably affected by the\nbody\u2019s reaction to the weather, and by the function of organs,\nsuch as digestion. In her work, Grouchy also emphasizes the role of\nphysiology in morality, arguing that sympathy arises first and\nforemost out of the sensations caused by internal organs.\n4.1 Moral Psychology\n\nGrouchy\u2019s moral philosophy cannot be defined in terms of one\nparticular influence. Her arguments carefully weave together elements\nfrom what we would recognize now as distinct ethical theories: ancient\nvirtue ethics, stoicism, and utilitarianism.\n4.1.1 Early modern developmental psychology\n\nLocke was a major influence in eighteenth century moral psychology,\nespecially through his Thoughts on Education in which he\nargued that every aspect of an infant\u2019s experience contributes\nto her moral and cognitive development. Like him, Grouchy traces the\ndevelopment of morality to infancy, arguing that its first sources\noccur \u201cin the cradle\u201d when an infant experiences the pain\nof being separated from her nurse and the pleasure of being reunited\nwith her.\n\nFrom Locke, but also Condillac, Grouchy takes the idea that cognitive\ndevelopment is primarily physiological at source, but can lead, with\nthe proper education, to the development of moral sentiment on the one\nhand (the soul) and of abstract ideas on the other (the mind). The two\ntogether, for Grouchy, gives us the idea of justice.\n4.1.2 Physiology\n\nThe most important physiologist thinker during Grouchy\u2019s\nlifetime was her brother in law Pierre-Georges Cabanis. In 1796, two\nyears before the publication of the Letters, but four years\nafter they were first drafted, Cabanis presented a number of lectures\non a topic that was central to the most original parts of\nGrouchy\u2019s response to Smith, namely, the role of the sensations\nof pleasure and pain in bringing about sympathy, and ultimately\nmorality. His lectures were printed in 1802 under the title Les\nRapports du Physique et du Moral. Arguing that morality was the\nresult of reasoning about sensations, Cabanis proposed that\n\u201cmoral properties were nothing but physical properties\nconsidered from certain particular points of view\u201d and that\n\n\n[i]t is from that point of view that the physical study of man is\nprincipally interesting: this is where the philosopher, the moralist,\nthe legislator must direct their gaze, and where they can find at the\nsame time new lights on human nature, and fundamental ideas on its\nperfectioning. (Cabanis 1802: 78, 80)\n\n\nGrouchy agrees with Cabanis that the ultimate source of human\ndevelopment is physical, and this is how she departs from\nSmith\u2019s account of sympathy. Smith acknowledges that sympathy\nexists as part of human psychology, but Grouchy insists on tracing its\norigins and finds them in sensations of pleasure and pain. While\nCabanis is mostly interested in finding physiological correspondences\nfor particular moral or psychological phenomena, Grouchy, starting\nfrom simply physiological sources, builds a complex and complete\ntheory of moral development, which starts from particular and personal\nattachments and ends in the love of humanity in general.\n4.1.3 Pleasure and pain\n\nThe first causes of sympathy, Grouchy argues, are the sensations of\npains and pleasure one experiences as part of our relationship to\nanother. A baby who finds comfort at the breast of its nurse will\nexperience pain when it is separated from it, and later learn to\nrecognize and care for the pain experienced by the nurse. Grouchy\ndistinguishes between physical and moral pleasures and pains on the\none hand, and present and remembered pleasures and pains on the other.\nShe also argues that we can derive abstract ideas of pleasures and\npains.\n4.1.4 Stoicism\n\nThe principal Stoic element in the Letters on Sympathy is the\nway in which Grouchy describes the development of sympathy as\nreminiscent of the Stoic \u201ccradle arguments,\u201d that is,\noffering a description of infant behavior as evidence of what is\nnatural to human beings and not merely conventional. Stoic cradle\narguments often invoke the concept of oikeiosis. The Stoics\nclaim that what can be observed in infants is a natural concern for\nself-preservation. This tendency, oikeiosis, naturally grows\nto extend one\u2019s tendencies towards self-preservation to an\nimpartial concern for all (Annas 1993: 265). Animals and young\nchildren are capable of the early stages of the process\u2014that of\nrecognizing their own bodies as belonging to them, and learning how to\nuse them for their own survival. Mature animals are also able to\nengage in later stage of oikeiosis, that of caring for their\nyoung. Human oikeiosis starts as it does with animals, but\ndevelops further\u2014as far as cosmopolitanism.\n\nThe development of sympathy in Grouchy follows a similar pattern. We\nstart in infancy by recognizing our own pains and pleasures, those\nthat signal to us what we need to stay alive. From this the circle of\nsympathy is widened to include others who form part of our life,\nstarting with the observations of physical pleasures and pains, in\noneself and in others, then moving towards psychological sufferings,\nand extending the circle further to humanity in general.\n4.1.5 Utilitarianism\n\nGrouchy\u2019s strong emphasis on pain and pleasure might suggest\nthat her moral theoretical leanings are towards consequentialism\nrather than Stoicism. And indeed some of her discussions of what it\nmeans to do the right thing seem to be informed by consequentialism.\nIn Letter V, she claims that acts receive reason\u2019s approval\ndepending on the extent to which they benefit humanity. In Letter\nVIII, she suggests that the value of the law can be measured in part\nin terms of the pleasure and pain it produces.\n\nCabanis (C***) agreed with Grouchy that the ability to see and\nrecognize pain was central to sympathy and ultimately to morality, but\nhe also sought to reconcile this with a form of Stoicism. What\nattracted Cabanis\u2014and presumably Grouchy\u2014to Stoic\nphilosophy was the possibility it opened for a form of atheism that\nnonetheless saw something divinely pleasing in all living things.\nCabanis\u2019s last work is a defense of hylozoism rather than the\nmaterialism he is known for, i.e., the view that spirit, as reason, is\neverywhere, and most especially in humans and \u201chigher\u201d\nanimals. But nonetheless, Cabanis explicitly rejects the Stoic view\nthat pains and pleasure don\u2019t matter morally, and indeed,\nsuggests that even the Stoics did not believe this:\n\n\nWe cannot possibly agree with the Stoics that pain is not bad. Perhaps\npain is not always bad in its effects\u2014it can offer useful\nwarnings, sometimes even strengthens physical organs just as it\nimpresses greater energy and strength of will to morality. [\u2026]\nBut if pain was not an evil it would not be so for others anymore than\nfor ourselves. We should discount it in others and in ourselves. So\nwhy this tender humaneness that characterizes the greatest stoics much\nmore than the firmness and the constancy of their virtues? (Cabanis\n1824: 84)\n\n\nCabanis goes on to cite Cato, who gave up his horse for his companion\non a scorching road in Sicily, and Brutus, who gave his coat to a sick\nslave on a freezing winter night. Stoics themselves do not countenance\nthe view that pain should be ignored when it comes to acting.\nTherefore, one can be an ethical stoic and make the relief of pain\ncentral to one\u2019s morality.\n4.2 Political Philosophy\n4.2.1 Liberty\n\nSince the revival of neo-republican thought in contemporary political\nphilosophy, several philosophers of the past have been re-interpreted\nas republican thinkers. This is the case, for instance, with Mary\nWollstonecraft, who until recently was thought of as a liberal\nthinker, is now seen by many as an important source for feminist\nrepublicanism (Halldenius 2015; Berges & Coffee 2016). Although we\nshould be weary of reading too much contemporary political theory into\npast thinkers, in particular when it comes to very technical arguments\nand definitions, it is nonetheless often helpful to focus on the\ncentral themes of republican thought in order to understand these\nthinkers. In particular, the Revolutionary engagement with liberty was\nvery often framed in Roman terms with arguments that to become a\nrepublic was to become free from domination by an arbitrary power.\nThese thoughts resonated particularly strongly, and sometimes\ndifferently for women philosophers as they considered whether their\npositions as wives and daughters in a patriarchal society meant that\nthey too were dominated, and would carry on being so in a republic\nunless marriage and family laws were reformed. This was the focus of\nMary Wollstonecraft and Olympe de Gouges, but it was less so in the\ncase of Grouchy, who to some extent relied on her husband\u2019s more\npowerful and influential voice to propose feminist reforms.\n\nPlacing Grouchy in a republican context highlights the importance of\nher work for the French Revolution and vice versa. Few political\nphilosophers write in a vacuum; most are influenced by or wish to\ninfluence the events unfolding around them. But when the events are as\nremarkable as a revolution, then it makes no sense to ignore their\nimpact on the work we are looking at. In the case of Grouchy, it is\neven clearer that she wished to participate, through her writings, in\nthe making of the new Republic; in the summer of 1791, together with\nCondorcet and a few friends, she established a political journal,\nLe R\u00e9publicain, the purpose of which was to enlighten\nthe public as to what republicanism was.\n\nLe R\u00e9publicain lasted for just over a month, framed by\ntwo events: Louis XVI\u2019s attempted escape from France, and the\nChamp de Mars Massacre. The aim of Le R\u00e9publicain\nstated in its opening article, \u201cAvis aux Fran\u00e7ais,\u201d\nwas to promote the ideal of republicanism, attempting to make it more\nrespectable and better understood than it was at the time: \u201cto\nenlighten minds on the subject of republicanism, which is slandered\nbecause it is misunderstood\u201d. (Condorcet and Paine 1792, p.5\n\nA theme that is strongly present in all the articles of Le\nR\u00e9publicain, including the ones attributed to Grouchy, is\nthe threat to freedom constituted by any monarchy, no matter how\nwell-intentioned the monarch is. In this, Grouchy and the other\nauthors of the R\u00e9publicain differ from republicans\ninspired by Montesquieu, such as Siey\u00e8s, who believed that the\nform of government was incidental to a republican constitution as long\nas the ruler always acted in the public interest. Grouchy and others\ndisagreed on the grounds that the hereditary power granted to a\nmonarch is always arbitrary, so that even if it is benign, it is not\nreliably so. It does not matter, says Paine, whether a monarch is\n\u201ca fool a hypocrite or a tyrant\u201d\u2014what matters is\nthat this individual has \u201cabsolute power\u201d over everyone,\nincluding those who are not yet born (Condorcet and Paine 1792, p.5. A\nmonarch who is well intentioned may change his attitude for personal\nreasons and become a tyrant, or he may die and leave the power in the\nhands of a tyrannical successor.\n4.2.2 Equality\n\nPhilosophers of the French revolution were interested in equality as\nwell as liberty (fraternity was added later to the motto), but the\nequality that concerned them was equality of status, specifically\ncivic status, rather than political status. Very few of them even\nthought about economic equality. Sophie de Grouchy wrote that all\ncitizens are owed the same respect, and this implies that there should\nnot be extreme economic inequality.\n\nThe central argument of Grouchy\u2019s Letters is that\nvirtue, moral or political, is born out of sympathy, the ability and\npropensity to feel others\u2019 pain and to want to relieve it.\nGrouchy claims that we first experience sympathy as an infant in the\narms of a nurse, and that we learn progressively to feel sympathy for\nthe physical and mental pain that any other person experiences,\nwhether or not we are close to them. But in order for this to be\npossible, we do need to see the suffering other as a human being, as\nsomeone just as capable of experiencing pain as we are. Extreme\ninequality means that this does not happen: the very rich and the very\npoor do not regard each other as being part of the same species, so\nthat they cannot sympathize with each other and will not apply the\nlaws of morality and justice in their dealings with each other (Letter\nVIII).\n\nGrouchy\u2019s concrete proposal to reduce extreme inequality does\nnot include even the possibility of future inequality. She assumes\nthat without legally supported inequality, natural inequalities (in\nintelligence and fecundity) would result in three quarters of the land\nbeing distributed randomly according to luck and skill and one quarter\ndistributed equally between families. But this, she argues, with\nfigures at hand, would still exclude extreme poverty or extreme wealth\nand would be sufficient to ensure that all citizens recognized each\nother as equally worthy of respect.\n\nAlthough there is definitely a feminist background to Grouchy\u2019s\nLetters, one which reflects her husband\u2019s 1790 paper on\nthe inclusion of women to the rights of the city, and perhaps in fact\ninspired that paper, it does not have a clear or central feminist\nagenda. Humanity in general is the focus of her discussion; women are\nexplicitly included in the arguments (indeed, the very first teacher\nof sympathy is the wet-nurse, the most prominent example given of a\ngood teacher is Sophie\u2019s own mother, and mothers and fathers are\nequally enjoined to participate in a child\u2019s proper education)\nbut they are not given separate consideration. In her discussion of\nfamily law, she does mention reforms that would affect women more\nparticularly.\n4.3 Legal Philosophy\n4.3.1 Citizenship\n\nIn her defense of equality, Sophie de Grouchy considers the problems\nbrought about by inequality of status, privileges, and wealth and the\nway in which the law contributes to these problems by maintaining\nprivileges. She is in agreement with the principles debated in the\nearly days of the French revolution, in particular by Emmanuel\nSiey\u00e8s who argued that to be unequal in the eyes of the law is\nto be potentially dominated. That is, a citizen can use a privileged\nrelationship to the law to abuse another. Grouchy argues that this was\none the greatest wrongs of the Ancient R\u00e9gime, i.e., when the\nlaw is not applied equally to all, those who cannot manipulate it\nperceive themselves as dominated:\n\n\n[When the law allows for] privileges, hereditary, personal or local\nwhich offer a legal loophole, direct or indirect, [t]hen the people\nare tempted to see criminal laws as made against them and in favor of\nthe rich, as the result of an association designed to oppress them.\n(Letter VIII, p. 152\n\n4.3.2 Punishment\n\nMuch of Grouchy\u2019s discussion of the law focuses of the question\nof punishment. Before 1789, there were a number of ways in which the\nlaw could kill its criminals depending both on the kind of crime they\nhad committed and their station. Aristocrats were decapitated with a\nsword. This was regarded as the most honorable death, although it was\nnot always the least painful or horrible. The Count Lally-Tollendal,\nwho received the death penalty in 1766 for having betrayed the\nKing\u2019s interest at war, had to be hit three times by the sword\nbefore his neck could be broken and the head detached. Sanson, the\nexecutor of the Revolution, cited his example when defending the\nproposed new machine that would cut heads off neatly and instantly.\nNonetheless, decapitation was more honorable than the sentences\nreserved for commoners of death by hanging (murderers) or the wheel\n(thieves, highway robbers). The crime women were most commonly accused\nof was infanticide or performing abortions. These were punished by\nhanging when they were found guilty of having killed their infants,\nbut, as was most often the case, when evidence was lacking, they would\ndo prison time for fornication, or be freed until more evidence could\nbe found.\n\nGrouchy\u2019s discussion of punishment is clearly influenced by the\nwritings of the Milanese criminologist Cesare Beccaria. Beccaria had\nalready argued for the necessity of equal penalties for all as even\nprivileges must rest on an equal respect for the law. His book On\nCrimes and Punishment published in 1764 was translated in French\nthat same year and published with a lengthy commentary from Voltaire.\nBeccaria came to Paris and spent much of 1776 in Madame\nHelvetius\u2019s salon in Auteuil. His influence was no doubt still\npresent some years later when the Marquis de Condorcet, and their\nfuture brother-in-law Pierre-George Cabanis, and later\nCondorcet\u2019s wife Sophie de Grouchy also became frequent\nvisitors. This, as well as Condorcet\u2019s close connection with\nVoltaire, and his own engagement at the time Beccaria\u2019s book was\npublished in penal reform, goes some way towards explaining\nGrouchy\u2019s affinities with Beccaria\u2019s claims. In her\nLetters on Sympathy, she argues that:\n\n\nIn order for the fear of a sentence to be effective and beneficial the\nsentence must not outrage. Its justice must be perceptible to average\nreason, and it must especially awaken the conscience, at the same time\nas it punishes its silence and slumber. But this will not be so\n[\u2026] if a judge can arbitrarily harden or soften a sentence; if\nthere are privileges, hereditary, personal or local which offer a\nlegal loophole, direct or indirect. (Letter VIII)\n\n4.3.3 Marriage and family laws\n\nDivorce was legalized and made more accessible for a brief period\nduring the French Revolution before it was codified under Napoleon in\na way that made much more difficult to obtain, especially for women.\nGrouchy in her Letters argues in favor not only of divorce,\nbut of short-term, renewable marriage contracts and clear rights for\nchildren born outside marriage and for their mothers. In these she is\nin agreement with another woman philosopher of the Revolution, Olympe\nde Gouges. Grouchy derived these arguments at least in part from\nMontesquieu\u2019s analysis of the Roman law in the Spirit of the\nLaw.\n4.3.4 Commercial law\n\nGrouchy also argued that a heavily regulated market increased poverty,\nforcing the poor to remain poor, or even become poorer because they\ncouldn\u2019t regulate their exchanges or negotiate their work and\nproduction fairly. Grouchy, like Condorcet and Turgot, believed that\nshackling the market with strict laws was a form of domination and\nthat allowing farmers and merchants to set their own prices would go\nsome way towards relieving poverty in the country. Thus she can be\ninterpreted as one of the original defenders of commercial\nrepublicanism (Berg\u00e8s 2018a).\n",
