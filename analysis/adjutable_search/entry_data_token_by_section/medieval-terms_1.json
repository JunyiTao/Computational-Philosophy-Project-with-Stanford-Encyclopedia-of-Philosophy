    "main_text": "Signification\n2. Signification\n\nSignification contrasts with the other properties of terms in one\nmajor respect, for the other properties (perhaps with the exception of\nappellation in some authors, and natural supposition) are all\nproperties of terms relative to their occurrence in particular\npropositions \u2013 indeed, they are properties of occurrences of\n terms.[7]\n Signification, however, is independent of a term\u2019s particular\nuses or occurrences: \u201cSignification differs from supposition in\nthis that signification is prior to supposition\u201d (Lambert, tr.\nMaloney, p.\n 254).[8]\n Indeed, the other properties are dependent on the signification of\nthe term. For example, an occurrence of a term can only supposit\npersonally (see\n section 3)\n for certain objects in virtue of its signifying them, among others,\nor signifying some property they share.\n\nA twelfth-century commentary on the Perihermeneias reports\nPorphyry as saying that at the time of Aristotle, there was a great\ndebate over the principal signification of utterances: was it\n\u2018res\u2019 (things) or incorporeal natures (Plato) or\nsensus (sensations) or imaginationes\n(representations) or intellectus\n (concepts)?[9]\n In fact, medieval philosophers of language were heir to two\nconflicting semantic theories. According to Aristotle, the greatest\nauthority from the ancient world, words name things by signifying\nconcepts in the mind (Boethius translated Aristotle\u2019s term as\npassiones animae \u2013 affections of the soul) which are\nlikenesses abstracted from them. But Augustine, the greatest of the\nChurch fathers, had held that words signify things by means of those\n concepts.[10]\n This led the medievals to the question: do words signify concepts or\nthings? The question had already been asked by Alexander of\nAphrodisias and his answer was transmitted to the medievals in\nBoethius\u2019 second commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nPerihermeneias (De Interpretatione):\n\u201cAlexander asks, if they are the names of things, why has\nAristotle said that spoken sounds are in the first place signs of\nthoughts \u2026 But perhaps, he says, he puts it this way because\nalthough spoken sounds are the names of things we do not use spoken\nsounds to signify things, but [to signify] affections of the soul that\nare produced in us by the things. Then in view of what spoken sounds\nthemselves are used to signify he was right to say they are primarily\nsigns of them\u201d (tr. Smith, pp.\n 36\u201337).[11]\n So words primarily signify concepts.\n\nBut the matter was not settled, other than that whatever view a\nmedieval philosopher took, it had to be made to accord with the\nauthority of Aristotle, perhaps in extremis by reinterpreting\nAristotle\u2019s words. Abelard refers to a distinction between\nsignificatio intellectuum (signification of concepts) and\nsignificatio rei (signification of the thing), more properly\ncalled nomination or appellation (see De Rijk, Logica\nModernorum, vol. II(1), pp. 192\u20135). Similarly, the\nTractatus de proprietatibus sermonum asks whether words\nsignify concepts or things, and responds: both (intellectum et\nrem), but primarily a thing via a concept as medium (op.cit. II\n(2), p. 707).\n\nA particular novelty of the thirteenth century, however, was to\nconceive of the concept itself as a sign. We find this in Lambert of\nAuxerre: \u201cThe signification of a term is the concept of a thing,\nfor which concept of a thing (intellectus rei) a vocal sound\nis imposed at the will of the one instituting it, for, as Aristotle\nproposes in Book One of On Interpretation vocal sounds are\nsigns of affections (passiones) that are in a soul, that is,\nin an intellect, whereas concepts are signs of things\u201d (tr.\nMaloney, p.\n 253).[12]\n Hence by transitivity, utterances which are signs of concepts which\nare signs of things are themselves signs of things: \u201cA vocal\nsign that is a sign of a sign \u2026 [will be directly] a sign of\nthe concept and indirectly a sign of the thing\u201d (tr. Maloney, p.\n 254).[13]\n For example, \u2018man\u2019 immediately signifies the concept man,\nbut by mediation of the concept it signifies the second substance or\nform of man. Accordingly, it can supposit for what fall under man,\ne.g., Plato and Socrates. But it does not signify Plato or\nSocrates.\n\nAs noted above, this last distinction was elided by Ockham, in making\nthe mental act the universal, a name of the things. \u2018Man\u2019,\nhe says, signifies Plato and Socrates and all men equally, by virtue\nof its subordination to the mental act. Once signification is treated\nextensionally in this way, its only difference from supposition lies\nin its priority: a general term signifies all those things of which it\ncan be truly predicated (Ockham, Summa Logicae I c. 33).\n",
