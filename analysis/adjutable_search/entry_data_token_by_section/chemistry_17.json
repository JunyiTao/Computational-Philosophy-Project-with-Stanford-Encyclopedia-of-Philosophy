    "main_text": "Structure in Chemistry || Microessentialism: Is Water H2O?\n4.5 Microessentialism: Is Water H2O?\n\nIn the final part of this section about structure, we consider a\nfavorite example of philosophers: the thesis that \u201cWater is\nH2O.\u201d This thesis is often taken to be\nuncontroversially true and is used as evidence for semantic\nexternalism and for essentialism about natural kinds (Kripke 1980;\nPutnam 1975,  1990). Since general theses about the theory of reference\nand semantic externalism are beyond the scope of this article, we\nfocus narrowly on chemical essentialism. Is having a common essential\nmicrostructure sufficient to individuate chemical kinds and explain\ntheir general features? And if so, is \u201cbeing\nH2O\u201d sufficient to individuate water?\n\nThe essentialist thesis is often stylized by writing \u201cwater =\nH2O\u201d or \u201c(all and only) water is\nH2O\u201d. Ignoring the issue of whether the identity\nmakes sense (Needham 2000) and of understanding what the predicates\napply to in the second formulation (Needham 2010a), it is not clear\nthat either formulation expresses the kind of thesis that\nessentialists intend. \u201cH2O\u201d is not a\ndescription of any microstructure. Rather,\n\u201cH2O\u201d is a compositional formula, describing\nthe combining proportions of hydrogen and oxygen to make water.\n\nA reasonable paraphrase of the standard formulation would be\n\u201cWater is a collection of H2O molecules.\u201d\nHowever, although the expression \u201cH2O molecule\u201d\ndescribes a particular microentity, it by no means exhausts the kinds\nof microparticles in water, and says nothing of the\nmicrostructure by which they are related in water. Describing\nthe microstructure of water completely involves elaborating the\ndetails of this interconnected structure, as well as detailing how\nthey depend on temperature and pressure, and how they change over time\n(Finney 2004).\n\nLike many other substances, water cannot simply be described as a\ncollection of individual molecules. Here are just a few examples of\nthe complexities of its microstructure: water self-ionizes, which\nmeans that hydrogen and hydroxide ions co-exist with H2O\nmolecules in liquid water, continually recombining to form\nH2O molecules. At the same time, the H2O\nmolecules associate into larger polymeric species. Mentioning these\ncomplexities isn\u2019t just pedantic because they are often what give rise\nto the most striking characteristics of substances. For example, the\nelectrical conductivity of water is due to a mechanism in which a\npositive charge (hydrogen ion) attaches at one point of a polymeric\ncluster, inducing a co-ordinated transfer of charge across the\ncluster, releasing a hydrogen ion at some distant point. The effect is\nthat charge is transferred from one point to another without a\ntransfer of matter to carry it. The hydrogen bonding underlying the\nformation of clusters is also at the root of many other distinctive\nproperties of water including its high melting and boiling points and\nits increase in density upon melting. As van Brakel has argued (1986,\n2000), water is practically the poster child for such\n\u201cnon-molecular\u201d substances.\n\nMaybe water isn\u2019t simply a collection of H2O molecules, but\nit certainly has a microstructure and perhaps the essentialist thesis\ncould be recast along the lines of \u201cWater is whatever has its\nmicrostructure,\u201d writing in the information that would save this\nfrom tautology. But this thesis still endorses the idea that\n\u201cwater\u201d is a predicate characterized by what Putnam calls\nstereotypical features. This neglects the importance of macroscopic,\nyet scientifically important, properties such as boiling points,\nspecific heats, latent heats, and so on, from which much of the\nmicrostructure is actually inferred. Indeed, many of the criteria that\nchemists use to determine the sameness and purity of substances are\nmacroscopic, not microscopic. In fact, international standards for\ndetermining the purity of substances like water depend on the careful\ndetermination of macroscopic properties such as the triple-point, the\ntemperature and pressure where liquid, gaseous, and solid phases exist\nsimultaneously (Needham 2011).\n\nSo is water H2O? In the end, the answer to this question\ncomes down to how one interprets this sentence. Many chemists would be\nsurprised to find out that water wasn\u2019t H2O, but perhaps\nthis is because they read \u201cH2O\u201d as a shorthand\n(Weisberg 2005) or as a compositional formula in the manner we\ndiscussed in the opening of this section. Water is actually\ncharacterized by making reference to both its microstructural and\nmacroscopic features, so this can\u2019t on its own provide a justification\nfor microessentialism.\n\nFor these reasons, microessentialist claims would need to be grounded\nin chemical classification and explanation: the systems of\nnomenclature developed by IUPAC are based entirely on microstructure,\nas are theoretical explanations of the chemical and spectroscopic\nbehaviour of substances (see Hendry 2016). On the other hand,\nH2O content fails to track usage of the term\n\u201cwater\u201d by ordinary-language speakers, who seem to have\ndifferent interests to chemists (Malt 1994). Pluralism is one\nresponse to these tensions: Hasok Chang (2012) urges that even within\nscience, water\u2019s identity with H2O should be left open;\nJulia Bursten (2014) tries to reconcile the special role of\nmicrostructure in chemistry with the failure of microessentialism; and\nJoyce Havstad (2018) argues that chemists\u2019 use of substance concepts\nis just as messy and disunified as biologists\u2019 use of various species\nconcepts.\n",
