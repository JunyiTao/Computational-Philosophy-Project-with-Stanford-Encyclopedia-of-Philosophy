    "main_text": "First Meditation Doubting Arguments || Dreaming Doubts\n3.1 Dreaming Doubts\n\nHistorically, there are at least two distinct dream-related doubts.\nThe one doubt undermines the judgment that I am presently\nawake \u2013 call this the \u2018Now Dreaming Doubt\u2019. The\nother doubt undermines the judgment that I am ever awake\n(i.e., in the way normally supposed) \u2013 call this the\n\u2018Always Dreaming Doubt\u2019. A textual case can be made on\nbehalf of both formulations being raised in the\nMeditations.\n\nBoth doubts appeal to some version of the thesis that the experiences\nwe take as dreams are (at their best) qualitatively similar to those\nwe take as waking \u2013 call this the \u2018Similarity\nThesis\u2019. The Similarity Thesis may be formulated in a variety of\nstrengths. A strong Similarity Thesis might contend that some dreams\nseem experientially similar to waking, even on hindsight, subsequent\nto waking; a weaker rendering of the thesis might contend merely that\ndreams seem similar to waking while having them, but\nnot upon waking. Arguably, the sceptical doubt is equally potent on\neither rendering. Even so, on the most natural reading the First\nMeditation passage seems to suggest the stronger view, with its\nreference to \u201cexactly similar thoughts\u201d:\n\nHow often, asleep at night, am I convinced of just such familiar\nevents \u2013 that I am here in my dressing-gown, sitting by the fire\n\u2013 when in fact I am lying undressed in bed! Yet at the moment my\neyes are certainly wide awake when I look at this piece of paper; I\nshake my head and it is not asleep; as I stretch out and feel my hand\nI do so deliberately, and I know what I am doing. All this would not\nhappen with such distinctness to someone asleep. Indeed! As if I did\nnot remember other occasions when I have been tricked by exactly\nsimilar thoughts while asleep! (AT 7:19, CSM 2:13)\n\n\nAs for the range of experiences that we can suppose dreams to be \ncapable of imitating, Descartes looks to hold that every\nkind of sensory experience is plausibly reproducible in dreams,\nand thereby subject to doubt. He writes: \u201cevery sensory \nexperience I have ever thought I was having while awake I can\nalso think of myself as sometimes having while asleep\u201d\n(Med. 6, AT 7:77, CSM 2:53).\n\nThe Similarity Thesis is sufficient to generate straightaway\nthe Now Dreaming Doubt. Since I can think of a dream as being \nqualitatively similar to my present experience, then, for all\nI know, I am now dreaming. I might be awake. But if,\nfor all I know, I am now dreaming, then I lack perfect knowledge\nof any matters whose truth presupposes that I am now awake. The\nNow Dreaming Doubt does its epistemic damage so long as it\nundermines my reasons for believing I\u2019m awake. And at this\nstage of the Meditations, Descartes thinks that it does: \n\u201cthere are never any sure signs by means of which being\nawake can be distinguished from being asleep\u201d (Med. 1, AT\n7:19, CSM 2:13).\n\nThe Now Dreaming Doubt generates widespread sceptical\nconsequences. For if I do not perfectly know that I am now\nawake, then neither do I know that I\u2019m now \u201cholding \nthis piece of paper in my hands,\u201d to cite an example \nthe First Meditation meditator had supposed to be \u201cquite \nimpossible\u201d to doubt. Reflection on the sceptical doubt\nchanges his mind, and he comes around to the view that, for all\nhe knows, the sensible objects of his present experience are\nmere figments of a vivid dream.\n\nMuch ado has been made about whether dreaming arguments are\nself-refuting. According to an influential objection, similarity\ntheses presuppose that we can reliably distinguish dreams\nand waking \u2013 we need first to distinguish them, in order to \ncompare them; yet the conclusion of dreaming arguments entails that\nwe cannot reliably distinguish them. Therefore, if the \nconclusion of such an argument is true, then the premise invoking\nthe Similarity Thesis cannot be.\n\nSome formulations of dreaming arguments are indeed self-refuting\nin this way. Of present interest is whether all\nare \u2013 specifically, whether Descartes makes the mistake.\nIt would appear that he does not, based on a Sixth Meditation\npassage summarizing the earlier doubts. There, his formulation \npresupposes simply the truism that we do, in fact, make a\ndistinction between waking and dreaming (never mind whether\nreliably). He states the relevant premise in terms of what we \nthink of as waking, versus what we think of\nas dreaming: \u201cevery sensory experience I have ever \nthought I was having while awake I can also think\nof myself as sometimes having while asleep\u201d (AT 7:77, CSM\n2:53, italics added). This formulation avoids the charge of\nself-refutation, for it is compatible with the conclusion that\nwe cannot reliably distinguish dreams and waking.\n\nDoes Descartes also put forward a second dreaming argument, the Always\nDreaming Doubt? There is strong textual evidence to support this (see\nNewman 1994), though it is by no means the standard interpretation.\nThe conclusion of the Always Dreaming Doubt is generated from the very\nsame Similarity Thesis, together with a further sceptical assumption,\nnamely: that for all I know, the processes producing what I take as\nwaking are no more veridical than those producing what I take as\ndreams. As the meditator puts it: \n\n[E]very sensory experience I have ever thought I was having while\nawake I can also think of myself as sometimes having while asleep; and\nsince I do not believe that what I seem to perceive in sleep comes\nfrom things located outside me, I did not see why I should be any more\ninclined to believe this of what I think I perceive while awake. (Med.\n6, AT 7:77, CSM 2:53)\n\n\nThe aim of the Always Dreaming Doubt is to undermine not whether\nI\u2019m now awake, but whether so-called \u201csensation\u201d is\nproduced by external objects even on the assumption that I am\nnow awake. For in the cases of both waking and dreaming, my cognitive\naccess extends only to the productive result, but not the\nproductive process. On what basis, then, do I conclude that\nthe productive processes are different \u2013 with external objects\nplaying more of a role in waking than in dreaming? For all I know,\nboth sorts of experience are produced by some subconscious faculty\nof my mind. As Descartes has his meditator say:\n\n[T]here may be some other faculty [of my mind] not yet fully known to\nme, which produces these ideas without any assistance from external\nthings; this is, after all, just how I have always thought ideas are\nproduced in me when I am dreaming. (Med. 3, AT 7:39, CSM 2:27)\n\n\nThe sceptical consequences of the Always Dreaming Doubt are even\nmore devastating than those of the Now Dreaming Doubt. If I do not\nperfectly know that \u201cnormal waking\u201d experience is\nproduced by external objects, then, for all I know, all\nof my experiences might be dreams of a sort. For all I\nknow, there might not be an external world. My best\nevidence of an external world derives from my preconceived opinion\nthat external world objects produce my waking experiences. Yet the \nAlways Dreaming Doubt calls this into question:\n\nAll these considerations are enough to establish that it is not\nreliable judgement but merely some blind impulse that has made me\nbelieve up till now that there exist things distinct from myself which\ntransmit to me ideas or images of themselves through the sense organs\nor in some other way. (Med. 3, AT 7:40, CSM 2:27)\n\n\nThe two dreaming doubts are parasitic on the same Similarity Thesis,\nthough their sceptical consequences differ. The Now Dreaming Doubt\nraises the universal possibility of delusion: for any one of\nmy sensory experiences, it is possible (for all I know) that the\nexperience is delusive. The Always Dreaming Doubt raises the\npossibility of universal delusion: it is possible (for all I\nknow) that all my sensory experiences are delusions (say, from a\nGod\u2019s-eye perspective).\n",
