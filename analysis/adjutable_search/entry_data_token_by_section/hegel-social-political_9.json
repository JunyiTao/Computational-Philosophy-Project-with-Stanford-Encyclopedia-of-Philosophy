    "main_text": "Ethical Life\n6. Ethical Life\n\nHegel\u2019s concept of \u2018Ethical Life\u2019\n[Sittlichkeit] plays a pivotal role in his political and legal\nthought. It is here that Hegel takes other concepts considered earlier\nfound in Abstract Right (such as contract, property and punishment) and\nMorality to grasp them anew but now in their social \u2013 and more\n\u201cconcrete\u201d context. The following discussion retains an\nabstract character insofar as Hegel discusses institutions that existed\nat his time \u2013 like the family, civil society and the state\n\u2013 but in ways meant to bring out the rational within the actual\n(and actual within the rational) (see Stern 2006). For example, core\nideas about what constitutes a wrong from his discussion of punishment\nreturn, but with a deeper and evolved understanding of their place in a\nsocial context that brings out a different character and complexity to\nhis views \u2013 which is intended to unpack the character and\ncomplexity of the inner rationality that Hegel believes we can discern\nin the world.\n\nEthical Life is divided into three parts where each builds off of\nthe analysis thus far into the nature of Abstract Right and Morality,\nbut where each part, in turn, develops after the other. This ordering\nis not chronological, but dialectical. We are not a member of civil\nsociety or the state after we join a family, but the concepts of the\nformer are further developments from the latter as the following\nsections bear out.\n",
