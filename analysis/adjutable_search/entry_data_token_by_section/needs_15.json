    "main_text": "Distribution According to Need || Effectiveness Principle\n5.5 Effectiveness Principle\n\n\nA variant on the weighted priority view has been proposed by Hassoun\nin the form of her \u2018effectiveness principle\u2019, defined as\nfollows:\n\n\n\nFirst, rank the possible policies from best to worst according to how\nmuch weighted need they alleviate. Second, rank the possible policies\nfrom best to worst according to the number of people they help. Third,\nfor each policy, combine its ranking in terms of how much weighted\nneed it alleviates with its ranking for how many people it helps to\nyield its final score (Hassoun 2009, 259\u201360).\n\n\nThe new element introduced by Hassoun here is the idea that needs\npolicies are better to the extent that they help more people rather\nthan fewer even if the overall improvement in (weighted)\nneed-satisfaction remains the same. Of course this would be liable to\nmake matters worse in the kind of case that worries Crisp. Where the\nweighted priority principle can be faulted for allowing many\nrelatively minor need claims to outweigh the more serious claims of a\nfew badly-off people, adding in a component that gives credit simply\nfor the number of people who are aided only adds to the\nproblem. Nonetheless, it is worth asking whether the justice of an\nallocation should be sensitive to the sheer number of people whose\nneeds are met.\n\n\nOne reason for thinking so might be that it always shows respect for a\nperson to attend practically to their needs, even if only in a small\nway. So the more people who are treated when an allocation is\nperformed, the more recognition is extended to those in need. The\nchallenge, however, is to understand why sufficient respect is not\nbeing shown when everyone\u2019s claims are properly\nconsidered by whoever is performing an allocation, even if the\nend result is that some people get nothing because whatever claim they\nmight have is justifiably outweighed by the stronger claims of other\npeople. So one might question whether the numbers being aided has\nthe deeper significance that Hassoun\u2019s effectiveness principle\nimplies, as opposed merely to providing evidence that no-one\u2019s\nclaim has been overlooked.\n\n\nThe upshot of this discussion is that in conditions of scarcity, there\nis no uniquely defensible way of spelling out the principle of\ndistribution according to need. We face conflicting imperatives: to\nmeet as many needs as possible, taking into account how much each\ncosts to satisfy, and to preserve comparative justice by ensuring that\npeople whose needs are similar are treated in the same way. This can\nbe presented as a trade-off between efficiency and justice, but since\nas noted earlier we are often required to meet needs as a matter of\njustice, it can also be seen as a clash between non-comparative and\ncomparative justice.\n",
