Introductory Preliminaries\n\nPhilosophical reflection upon the notion of omnipotence raises many\npuzzling questions about whether or not a consistent notion of\nomnipotence places limitations on the power of an omnipotent agent.\nCould an omnipotent agent create a stone so massive that that agent\ncould not move it? Paradoxically, it appears that however this\nquestion is answered, an omnipotent agent turns out not to be\nall-powerful. Could such an agent have the power to create or overturn\nnecessary truths of logic and mathematics? Could an agent of this kind\nbring about or alter the past? Is the notion of an omnipotent agent\nother than God an intelligible one? Could two omnipotent\nagents coexist? If there are states of affairs that an omnipotent\nagent is powerless to bring about, then how is the notion of\nomnipotence intelligibly to be defined? Moreover, an obstacle to\ntraditional Western theism arises if it is impossible for God to be\nmorally perfect and omnipotent. If an omnipotent God is powerless to\ndo evil, then how can he be omnipotent? Rational theology seeks an\nanalysis of the concept of omnipotence that provides sufficient\ngranularity about the powers of an omnipotent agent to resolve the\npuzzles and apparent paradoxes that surround this concept. If the\nnotion of omnipotence were found to be unintelligible, or incompatible\nwith moral perfection, then traditional Western theism would be\nfalse.\n\nAccording to some philosophers, omnipotence should be understood in\nterms of the power to perform certain tasks, for instance, to\nkill oneself, to make \\(2+2=4\\), or to make oneself non-omniscient.\nHowever, in recent philosophical discussion, omnipotence has been\nanalyzed in terms of the power to bring about certain possible\nstates of affairs, understood as propositional entities which\neither obtain or fail to obtain (Rosenkrantz & Hoffman 1980; Flint\n& Freddoso 1983; and Wierenga 1989). Because we believe that it\ncan yield an adequate analysis of omnipotence, we take this latter\napproach in what follows.\n\nSome philosophers have sought to understand omnipotence in terms of\ninfinite power. One example of such a philosopher is John\nLocke. In 1689, he writes that:\n\nIt is Infinity, which joined to our ideas of Existence, Power\nKnowledge, & c. makes that complex Idea, whereby we represent to\nourselves the best we can, the Supreme Being. (An Essay Concerning\nHuman Understanding, Book II, Ch. 23, \u00b6 35.)\n\n\nThis quotation suggests that omnipotence can be defined as infinite\npower. Leaving aside for the moment the historical question of how\nLocke understood infinite power, let us explore the suggested\ndefinition of omnipotence in the light of the prevailing mathematical\nunderstanding of infinity.\n\nThis mathematical understanding of infinity views it through the lens\nof transfinite arithmetic. Transfinite arithmetic presupposes that\nthere are infinitely many natural numbers. According to transfinite\narithmetic, the cardinal number of the set of natural numbers is\n\\(\\aleph_0\\) (aleph-null). (A cardinal number is a number\nthat can be used to answer the question \u201c How many?\u201d) In\nother words, if it is asked \u201c How many natural numbers are\nthere?\u201d, the correct answer is \\(\\aleph_0\\).\n\nThe founder of transfinite arithmetic, Georg Cantor (1845\u20131918),\nis also a founding father of set theory. He famously proved that\nthe set of real numbers has a larger cardinal number\nthan the set of natural numbers; the set of reals has the\nsame cardinality as the power set (the set of all\nsubsets) of the set of naturals. Cantor further argued that\n\\(\\aleph_0\\) is the first (and smallest) transfinite cardinal\nnumber in an infinite series of increasingly larger transfinite\ncardinals, \\(\\aleph_0,\\) \\(\\aleph_1,\\) \\(\\aleph_2\\), and so on. But\nnote that the numerical subscripts of these alephs do not refer to\ncardinal numbers, but rather refer to ordinal (or ordering)\nnumbers, e.g., first, second, third, and so forth. According\nto Cantor, there is no largest transfinite cardinal number, and\nalthough there are infinitely many transfinite cardinal numbers, there\nis no cardinal number of them. Rather, the totality of transfinite\ncardinals is absolutely infinite in a sui generis\nnon-arithmetical sense. Similarly, in Zermelo-Fraenkl set theory (ZF),\nand its extension ZFC (ZF + the axiom of choice), the totality of\ntransfinite cardinal numbers does not qualify as a set having\na definite cardinal number of members. Such a set would be too large;\nwere such a set to exist, paradoxical consequences would ensue akin to\nRussell\u2019s paradox. ZF avoids these paradoxical consequences by\ncharacterizing the totality of transfinite cardinals as an infinitely\nlarge proper class. Within the forms of axiomatic set theory\nthat have attracted significant support it cannot be proved that one\nproper class is larger than another.\n\nTransfinite cardinals may be used to quantify an amount of energy or\nforce, e.g., \\(\\aleph_0\\) joules, or \\(\\aleph_0\\) newtons. Or they may\nbe be used to state the cardinal number of a totality of objects,\ne.g., \\(\\aleph_2\\) states of affairs. Thus, one [first] way in which\n\u2018power\u2019 might be interpreted is as a power (or range of\npowers) to produce an energy or force quantified by a transfinite\ncardinal. One such option is that \u2018infinite power\u2019 means\nthe power to produce a specific transfinite quantity of\njoules or newtons, e.g., \\(\\aleph_0\\). The other option is that\n\u2018infinite power\u2019 means the power to produce any\ntransfinite quantity of joules or newtons, i.e., \\(\\aleph_0,\\)\n\\(\\aleph_1,\\) \\(\\aleph_2,\\) and so on ad infinitum. A third,\nmore radical option, is that \u2018infinite power\u2019 means the\npower to produce more joules or newtons than can be\nquantified by any transfinite cardinal number. Such energy or\nforce would appear to qualify as energy or force than which none\ngreater is possible.\n\nThe alternative way of interpreting \u2018infinite power\u2019 is as\nthe power to bring about infinitely many states of affairs. The three\noptions relevant to this interpretation of \u2018infinite\npower\u2019 parallel the three options just described. First, that\n\u2018infinite power\u2019 is the power to bring about a\nspecific transfinite cardinal number of states of affairs.\nSecond, that \u2018infinite power\u2019 is the power to bring about\nany transfinite cardinal number of states of affairs. Third,\nthat \u2018infinite power\u2019 is the power to bring about\nmore states of affairs than any transfinite cardinal\nnumber can quantify.\n\nThe standard view is that there is no greatest transfinite cardinal,\nand that there are proper classes containing more objects than can be\nquantified by any transfinite cardinal. Moreover, there could\nnot be an agent who has greater power than an\nomnipotent agent. Thus, with regards to the two interpretations\noffered, there is some reason to conclude that in each case the\nthird option is best.\n\nHowever, a philosopher who has positivistic or naturalistic\nleanings might argue that one should posit transfinite cardinals\nof only those sizes required by prevailing scientific\ntheories. Arguably, the prevailing theory of the space-time\ncontinuum in physics is committed to the existence of infinite\nsets which have the cardinality of the set of space-time points\ncontained within such a continuum (which is at least \\(\\aleph_1\\)). If\nan argument of that sort is correct, this scientific theory is, in\naddition, committed to the existence of the power set of the foregoing\nset of space-time points \u2013 which is needed to accommodate\ncontinuous and discontinuous linear paths. (This power set has the\ncardinality of the set of mathematical functions from reals to reals.)\nBut scientific theories do not appear to require the\nexistence of any set larger than that power set. So,\na philosopher who has positivistic inclinations might tentatively\nconclude that the cardinal number of this power set (which is at least\n\\(\\aleph_2\\)) is in fact the largest cardinal. In a related\nvein, W. V. O. Quine dismisses \u201cexcessive\u201d magnitudes, for\ninstance, \u201c\\(\\beth_\\omega\\) and inaccessible numbers,\u201d as\nmere fancies of \u201crecreational mathematics\u201d bereft of of\nontological import (Quine 1986, p. 400; cf. Quine 1960, Ch. 7). If a\nreader is unfamiliar with Quine\u2019s illustrations of\nscientifically gratuitous magnitudes, please note that \\(\\beth_0 =\n\\aleph_0\\), \\(\\omega\\) (omega) is \\(\\aleph_0\\)\u2019s [infinite]\nordinal counterpart, i.e., \\(\\aleph_0\\) is the \\(\\omega\\)-th\ncardinal number, and \\(\\beth_\\omega\\) is the \\(\\omega\\)-th iteration\nof the power set of \\(\\beth\\)0; inaccessible\nnumbers (roughly speaking) are (putative) uncountable large\ncardinals which cannot be derived via summations of, or power\nset operations on, smaller cardinals. Quine judges that such\nmagnitudes exceed the theoretical demands of the empirical sciences\nbecause admitting them would not contribute to the simplication of our\nscientific computations and generalizations. Even so, there is a view\nof the cumulative set-theoretical hierarchy to which Quine seems\n(reluctantly) willing to accede, at least in part because it provides\na \u201cconvenient cut-off\u201d limiting the extent of that\nhierarchy. According to this view, all sets are constructible\n(in a sense defined by Kurt G\u00f6del) from more elementary sets, a\nposition significantly more restrictive than is needed to avoid the\nknown set-theoretical paradoxes. But, arguably, when examining\nomnipotence, given its robust theological and metaphysical dimensions,\na less positivistic or naturalistic, more expansive, criterion of\nontological commitment is appropriate. After all, it would be natural\nto assume that the Supreme Being has the power to create any number of\npossible worlds governed by different laws of nature. Given that\nassumption, it appears that an omnipotent agent\u2019s power would\nnot be circumscribed by theoretical scientific laws governing the\nactual world.\n\nEven so, the notions of more energy or force than can be\nquantified by any transfinite cardinal, and of more states of\naffairs than can be quantified by any transfinite cardinal, are\nmind-boggling. Moreover, arguably, that much energy or force,\nor the power to bring about that many states of affairs, is\nimpossible. For this reason, with respect to each of the\ninterpretations of \u2018infinite power\u2019 on offer, there are\ndoubts about the viability of the corresponding third option. Thus,\nwith respect to each of these alternate interpretations of\n\u2018infinite power\u2019, it is an open question which of the\nthree corresponding options is best. Until greater clarity is attained\nabout this matter, a definition of omnipotence as infinite power is\nproblematic.\n\nMoreover, it can be plausibly argued that having the power to bring\nabout infinitely many states of affairs does not entail omnipotence.\nE.g., intuitively, an agent who has the power to move a feather into\nany of infinitely many positions, but lacks the power to move a heavy\nboulder, would not be omnipotent, despite having the power to bring\nabout infinitely many states of affairs.\n\nIt may be thought that, necessarily, any agent who has the power to\nproduce an infinitely large amount of energy or force is omnipotent.\nYet, this seems not to be true. After all, it seems possible for there\nto be an agent who is infinitely powerful in this sense, but who\nnonetheless lacks complete command and control of the\nenergies or forces it has the power to produce. If so, an\nagent\u2019s possessing the power to produce an infinite amount of\nenergy or force does not entail that the agent in question is\nomnipotent. As illustrated by the example described above of an agent\nwho has the power to move a feather into infinitely many positions,\nbut who lacks the power to move a heavy boulder, an agent\u2019s\n(S\u2019s) having the power to bring about infinitely many\nthings of one sort, does not guarantee that S has\nthe power to bring about things of another sort.\n\nBut even if there is some sort of infinite power such that,\nnecessarily, an agent, A, is omnipotent if and only if\nA has that sort of infinite power, the definitional claim\nthat omnipotence is such power is far too general to\nprovide a granular analysis of omnipotence \u2013 the kind\nof analysis of omnipotence which we are seeking. Proposed granular\nanalyses of omnipotence offer considerably greater\nspecificity about the powers of an omnipotent agent.\n\nLet us return to the historical question of Locke\u2019s\nunderstanding of infinite power. Locke explicitly rejects the notion\nthat there is an infinite cardinal number. He takes the contention\nthat there is such a number to be absurd. Rather, Locke appears to\nunderstand infinite power as unlimited power, consistent with the\nAristotelean notion that infinities are \u201cpotential\u201d and\nnever completed, as well as with the empiricist idea that infinity is\na wholly negative notion. The infinite sets discussed earlier are\n\u201cactual\u201d or completed infinities. According to one fairly\ncommon understanding of unlimited power, such power includes the power\nto bring about or undo necessary states of affairs, e.g., necessities\nof logic, mathematics, metaphysics, or ethics. Yet, it does not appear\nthat Locke means to attribute this power to an omnipotent agent; he\nnever contends that the Supreme Being has the power to bring about or\nundo necessities. In any event, we will critically examine the thesis\nthat an omnipotent agent has the power to bring about or undo\nnecessary states of affairs in what follows.\n\nOne sense of \u2018omnipotence\u2019 is, literally, that of having\nthe power to bring about any state of affairs whatsoever,\nincluding necessary and impossible states of affairs. Descartes seems\nto have had such a notion (Meditations, Section 1). Yet,\nAquinas and Maimonides held the view that this sense of\n\u2018omnipotence\u2019 is incoherent. Their view can be defended as\nfollows. It is not possible for an agent to bring about an\nimpossible state of affairs (e.g., that there is a\nshapeless cube), since if it were, it would be possible for an\nimpossible state of affairs to obtain, which is a contradiction (see\nAquinas, Summa Theologiae, Ia, 25, 3; and Maimonides,\nGuide for the Perplexed, Part I, Ch. 15). Nor is it possible\nfor an agent to bring about a necessary state of affairs\n(e.g., that all cubes are shaped). It is possible for an\nagent, \\(a\\), to bring about a necessary state of\naffairs, \\(s\\), only if possibly, (1) \\(a\\)\nbrings about \\(s\\), and (2) if \\(a\\)\nhad not acted, then \\(s\\) would have\nfailed to obtain. Because a necessary state of affairs obtains whether\nor not anyone acts, (2) is false. As a consequence, it is impossible\nfor an agent to bring about either a necessary or an impossible state\nof affairs. Many philosophers accept the principle that if an agent\nhas the power to bring about a state of affairs, then this\nentails that, possibly, the agent brings about that state of\naffairs. If this principle is correct, then the foregoing\nabsolute sense of \u2018omnipotence\u2019 is incoherent.\nAmong contemporary philosophers, Earl Conee (1991) rejects this\nprinciple in order to defend the view that an omnipotent being would\nhave the power to bring about any state of affairs whatsoever.\n\nA second sense of \u2018omnipotence\u2019 is that of maximal\npower, meaning just that no being could exceed the overall power\nof an omnipotent being. It does not follow that a maximally powerful\nbeing can bring about any state of affairs, since, as\nobserved above, bringing about some such states of affairs is\nimpossible. Nor does it follow that a being with maximal power can\nbring about whatever any other agent can bring about. If \\(a\\)\ncan bring about \\(s\\), and \\(b\\)\ncannot, it does not follow that \\(b\\)\nis not overall more powerful than \\(a\\), since\nit could be that \\(b\\) can bring about more states of\naffairs than \\(a\\) can, rather than the other way\naround. For the remainder of this entry the discussion concentrates on\nthis comparative sense of \u2018omnipotence\u2019 as\nmaximal power. Within the context of that discussion, it will be\nassumed that it is not possible for an agent to have the\npower to bring about any state of affairs whatsoever.\n\nThat a being is omnipotent just provided that its overall power is\nnot possibly exceeded by any being may be adopted as the most\ngeneral definition of omnipotence in this sense (Hoffman &\nRosenkrantz 2010). Still, the availability of a more fine-grained and\ninformative analysis, directly applicable to the full range of problem\ncases, is highly desirable. A number of prominent proposals for such a\nmore fine-grained and informative analysis of omnipotence will be\ndiscussed later.\n\nPower should be distinguished from ability. Power is\nability plus opportunity: a being which has maximal ability but which\nis prevented by circumstances from exercising those abilities would\nnot be omnipotent. Nothing could prevent an omnipotent agent from\nexercising its powers, if it were to endeavor to do so.\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, is it possible that there be a\nplurality of coexistent omnipotent agents? Among contemporary\nphilosophers of religion, Richard Swinburne (2008) holds that a\nplurality of coexistent omnipotent agents is possible.\n\nIf a plurality of coexistent omnipotent agents were even possible,\nthen possibly, at a time, \\(t\\), some\nomnipotent agent, \\(x\\), while retaining its\nomnipotence, endeavors to move a feather, and at \\(t\\),\nanother omnipotent agent, \\(y\\), while retaining its\nomnipotence, endeavors to keep that feather motionless. Intuitively,\nin this case, neither \\(x\\) nor \\(y\\)\nwould affect the feather as to its motion or rest. Thus, in this case,\nat \\(t\\), \\(x\\) would be powerless to\nmove the feather, and at \\(t\\), \\(y\\)\nwould be powerless to keep the feather motionless! But it is absurd to\nsuppose that an omnipotent agent could lack the power to move a\nfeather or the power to keep it motionless. Therefore, neither \\(x\\)\nnor \\(y\\) is omnipotent. This line of\nreasoning appears to reduce the notion of a plurality of coexistent\nomnipotent agents to absurdity. If such a reductio ad\nabsurdum is sound, then a plurality of coexistent omnipotent\nagents is impossible.\n\nIt might be replied that while neither of the omnipotent agents in\nquestion brings about what it endeavors to bring about, each of them\ncan do so, since each of them has the ability to do\nso; they fail to bring about what they endeavor to bring about only\nbecause they lack the opportunity to do so. But earlier\nobservations about the difference between power and ability and how\neach of them is related to omnipotence entail that omnipotence should\nbe understood in terms of the ability plus opportunity sense\nof \u2018can\u2019. If those earlier observations are correct, then,\nsince neither of the omnipotent agents under discussion can\ndo [in the ability plus opportunity sense] what it endeavors to do,\nthe possible reply under discussion does not succeed.\n\nOr it might be replied that the possible pair(s) of coexistent\nomnipotent agents would necessarily avoid stalemates of the\nforegoing sort in virtue of the members of each pair resembling one\nanother in some respect. This reply seems suspiciously ad\nhoc. It appears that the members of any possible pair of\ngenetically identical human twins could be stalemated, e.g., in an\narm-wrestling match. Why would not the same be true of a pair of\nsimilar coexistent omnipotent agents? It might be answered that each\nof the members of any possible pair of coexistent omnipotent agents\nwould be necessarily omniscient and necessarily morally perfect.\nMoreover, if two omnipotent agents are necessarily\nomniscient, they won\u2019t disagree about any\nfact, and if they are necessarily morally perfect, they\nwon\u2019t disagree about what is morally required\nor about whether they want so to act. It might then be\ninferred that any states of affairs that a pair of coexistent\nomnipotent agents would endeavor to bring about at a given time are\ncompatible. In the literature, the controversial social\ntrinitarianism of Richard Swinburne (2008), implies that the\nFather, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are a trio of coexistent\nomnipotent agents each of whom is necessarily omniscient and\nnecessarily morally perfect.\n\nHowever, one might object to the preceding reply on the grounds that\nif there is a pair of coexistent necessarily omniscient and\nnecessarily morally perfect omnipotent agents, then there is a pair of\nincompatible contingent states of affairs each of which is\nmorally optional for these agents, that is, neither morally\nprohibited nor morally required for them. The objection then proceeds\nas follows. It may be assumed that that the feather moves at\nt and that the feather remains motionless at t are a\npair of states of affairs of the sort in question. Apparently, also,\npossibly, under such circumstances, the state of affairs that the\nomnipotent agents in question are stalemated in their endeavors to\naffect the feather as to its motion or rest at t is morally\noptional for those agents. Analogously, in an arm-wrestling match\nbetween \\(A_1 \\amp A_2\\), possibly, the states of affairs\nthat \\(A_1\\) wins the match, that \\(A_2\\) wins the\nmatch, and that \\(A_1 \\amp A_2\\) are stalemated in the\nmatch are morally optional for \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\). In the light\nof the foregoing observations, it appears that if it is possible that\nthere are omnipotent agents of the sort in question, then possibly,\none of them endeavors to make the feather move at \\(t\\),\nwhile the other endeavors to keep it motionless at\n\\(t\\), even given their hypothesized necessary\nareas of epistemic and moral agreement. The foregoing defense of\nthe possibility of a plurality of coexistent omnipotent agents is\npersuasive only if there is a cogent reply to this objection.\n\nWould it strengthen such a defense to further require that the\ncoexistent omnipotent agents are necessarily aesthetically\nperfect, and hence, won\u2019t disagree about what\nis aesthetically required or about whether they want so to\nact? It appears not. After all, there appear to be incompatible,\ncontingent, aesthetically optional states of affairs, i.e.,\nstates of affairs which are neither aesthetically required nor\naesthetically prohibited for some agent, and considerations parallel\nto those adduced above apply. Moreover, it is not clear that\nfutile striving necessarily has negative aesthetic\nvalue, witness, e.g., Camus\u2019s The Myth of Sisyphus, and\nin any case, it can be argued plausibly that the equipoise of\nopposing forces possibly has positive aesthetic value,\nimplying that opposed volitional activities of coexistent omnipotent\nbeings would not necessarily be futile.\n\nFurther doubts about the possibility of a plurality of coexistent\nomnipotent beings are raised by considerations outlined below which\nseem to show that if some possible world is maximally good,\nin other words, is a best possible world, then no\npossible world is [uniquely] the best possible world, and\nlikewise with respect to a possible world that is second best, third\nbest, and so on.\n\nHere it is assumed that if there is a best possible world, then there\nis at least one such possible world containing contingently existing\nindividual substantial individuals. A parallel assumption is made\nabout any possible world good enough to be actualized by an\nomnipotent, omniscient, morally perfect, aesthetically perfect being,\ne.g., by a maximally great divinity such as God. But, with respect to\nany possible world containing contingently existing substantial\nindividuals, it appears that there is another possible world\nexactly resembling it but populated by different\ncontingently existing substantial individuals. It further appears that\nthe value of one of these worlds is equal to the value of another of\nthese worlds. So, it appears that if one of these possible worlds is\nbest, second best, third best, etc., then there is another possible\nworld of the ordinal rank in question.\n\nMoreover, different possible goods combined in different possible ways\nmay constitute different, logically independent, possible total goods\nof the same value. The following simple example illustrates this\npoint. Let it be assumed that the pleasure which would be produced by\nJohn\u2019s eating a mushroom pizza for dinner tonight and the\npleasure that would be produced by John\u2019s eating a garlic pizza\nfor dinner tonight are logically independent possible goods of the\nsame value. All other things being equal, a possible world containing\nJohn\u2019s eating a mushroom pizza for dinner tonight and\nJohn\u2019s not eating a garlic pizza tonight, and a possible world\ncontaining John\u2019s eating a garlic pizza for dinner tonight and\nJohn\u2019s not eating a mushroom pizza for dinner tonight,\nconstitute different possible goods of the same value. Generalizing\nfrom examples of this kind, it appears that if some possible world is\nbest, second best, third best, and so on, then there are\nother possible worlds, not exactly resembling them,\nwhich are best, second best, third best, and so on.\n\nSo, for any possible pair of coexistent God-like omnipotent agents, it\nappears that one member of that pair could endeavor to\nactualize a different, equally good, world than the other member\nof that pair, even given their hypothesized necessary epistemic,\nmoral, and aesthetic perfection. In the light of the reductio ad\nabsurdum presented earlier, it appears to follow that such pairs\nare impossible.\n\nLeibniz argued that there is a uniquely optimal possible world by\nappealing to the Principle of Sufficient Reason and the\nIdentity of Indiscernibles, notoriously concluding that the\nactual world is the best of all possible worlds. Among\ncontemporary philosophers, both the Principle of Sufficient\nReason and the Identity of Indiscernibles are\ncontroversial.\n\nAnother possible defense of the possibility of a plurality of\ncoexistent omnipotent agents appeals to quantum mechanics. Quantum\nentanglement seems to be a unique physical phenomenon whereby\nconcurrent activities of diverse contingently existing substantial\nindividuals are directly coordinated in virtue of a necessary linkage\nof some sort between those substantial individuals. By drawing an\nanalogy with this phenomenon, one might argue that there could be\ncoexistent omnipotent agents who necessarily avoid stalemates. Quantum\nmechanics implies that there exist pairs of entangled micro-particles\nsuch that it is causally necessary that one member of the pair is\nspin up if and only if the other member of the pair is\nspin up, independently of the locations of those\nmicro-particles. Albert Einstein skeptically described the theoretical\nphenomenon of entanglement as \u201cspukhafte Fernwirkung,\u201d\nthat is, as \u201cspooky action at a distance.\u201d Nowadays,\nhowever, entanglement is an experimentally confirmed part of physics.\nArguably, by analogy with entanglement, if a plurality of coexistent\nomnipotent agents is possible, then there could be\n\u201centangled\u201d omnipotent agents, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), such\nthat it is metaphysically necessary that \\(A_1\\) endeavors to bring\nabout a certain state of affairs if and only if \\(A_2\\) endeavors to\nbring about the same state of affairs. But quantum mechanics further\nimplies that there are entangled pairs of micro-particles such that it\nis causally necessary that one member of the pair is spin up\nif and only if the other member of the pair is spin down. The\nproperties of being spin up and being spin down are\ncontraries. Thus, if the analogy with quantum entanglement is taken\nseriously, then by parity of reasoning, one should conclude that if a\nplurality of necessarily cooperating coexistent omnipotent agents is\npossible, then possibly, there are \u201centangled\u201d\nomnipotent agents, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), such that it is metaphysically\nnecessary that \\(A_1\\) endeavors to act in some way if and only if\n\\(A_2\\) endeavors to act in a contrary way. Given this\nconclusion, and in the light of the reductio ad absurdum of\nthe possibility of a plurality of coexistent omnipotent agents\npresented earlier, an argument in favor of such a possibility by\nanalogy with quantum entanglement undermines itself, thereby\nreinforcing that reductio. So, one cannot credibly defend the\nmetaphysical possibility of a plurality of coexistent omnipotent\nagents by drawing an analogy with the phenomenon of quantum\nentanglement.\n\nFinally, could one credibly defend such a metaphysical possibility via\nthe hypothesis that it is metaphysically possible for there to be a\nplurality of necessarily indiscernible omnipotent God-like beings (in\nthe Leibnizian sense of indiscernible)? Because a plurality\nof necessarily indiscernible objects is of dubious\nintelligibility, such a defense would not be credible. Doubts about\nthe intelligibility of such a plurality arise because of perplexities\nconcerning the individuation and separation of any pair of necessarily\nindiscernible objects, and because positing the existence of a\nplurality of such objects is metaphysically extravagant and\ngratuitous. Indeed it seems that there is just as much reason to posit\nindefinitely many objects of the sort in question as there is to posit\na pair of them, whereas the intelligibility of a necessarily\nself-indiscernible object is not in doubt. A representative\nexample of a hypothetical plurality of necessarily indiscernible\nobjects is a plurality of necessarily coincident geometrical\npoints. In addition to the perplexities concerning the individuation\nand separation of any pair of such points, the assumption that it is\nmetaphysically possible for there to be a plurality of necessarily\ncoincident points is metaphysically frivolous. Post-Scholastic\nridicule of the sort that was directed at the alleged ontological\nexcesses of the Schoolmen, e.g., the query \u201cHow many angels may\nfit upon the point of a needle?\u201d, is quite appropriately\ndirected at metaphysical hypotheses of this sort. For these reasons,\nthe intelligibility of a plurality of necessarily coincident\ngeometrical points is suspect; the same is true of the intelligibility\nof a plurality of necessarily indiscernible omnipotent God-like\nbeings.\n\nCould an agent be accidentally omnipotent? At first glance, this\nappears possible, but there is the following argument for the opposite\nview. On the assumption that God exists, he has necessary existence,\nis essentially not temporally limited, and is essentially omnipotent.\nBut there could not be two coexistent omnipotent agents. Thus, on the\nassumption that God exists, an accidentally omnipotent being is\nimpossible.\n\nThis argument against the possibility of accidental omnipotence\npresupposes traditional Western theism. However, traditional Western\ntheism is highly controversial, and neutrality about whether\nGod exists has some advantages. If one is neutral about whether God\nexists, then omnipotence should not be assumed to be\nattributable only to the God of traditional Western theism or\nonly to an essentially omnipotent being.\n",
