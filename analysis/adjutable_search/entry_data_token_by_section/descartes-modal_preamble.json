    "main_text": "\n\nDescartes sometimes speaks of things that have possible existence, in\naddition to speaking of things as having actual existence. He also\nspeaks of eternal and necessary truths that are the product of\nGod\u2019s free and wholly unconstrained activity. One of the\ninterpretive projects that is inspired by Descartes\u2019 sometimes\nprovocative claims about possibility and necessity is the construction\nof a general Cartesian theory of modality. Any such theory would of\ncourse need to be sensitive to all of the claims that Descartes makes\nthat bear on possibility and necessity, but it would also need to\nunderstand and interpret those claims in the light of the terminology\nand commitments of his larger metaphysical system.\n",
