    "main_text": "The Nature of Players || Iterated Removal of Dominated Strategies\n3.4 Iterated Removal of Dominated Strategies\n\nIterative reasoning strategies akin to Backward Induction also exist\nfor games in strategic form. Rather than defining a new unary\nmove-predicate \\(\\best\\), however, these procedures work by\neliminating suboptimal actions. An action a is labeled\nsuboptimal or dominated if there is some other available\naction, b, that guarantees a better result than a, no\nmatter what the opponents do. In this case a rational player should\ndrop a from her space of admissible acts, as she would never\nplay it.\n\nJust as Backward Induction, dominance reasoning has an iterative\nflavor. Assuming common belief of rationality, players can expect\ntheir opponents to also drop dominated actions from consideration.\nDoing so reduces the game and might render further moves dominated, as\nis illustrated in the following example. Within the left-to-right\ntemporal progression, moves are greyed out as they get discarded.\nPlayers\u2019 preferences are represented with numerical values with\n1 the best and 4 the worst.\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nd \n\na\n1,1\n4,3 \n\nb\n2,2\n3,4  \n\n\n\n\n\nc\nd \n\na\n1,1\n4,3 \n\nb\n2,2\n3,4  \n\n\n\n\n\nc\nd \n\na\n1,1\n4,3 \n\nb\n2,2\n3,4  \n\n\n\nThe fact that further strategies may become dominated suggests to\nrepeat the procedure, turning removal of dominated strategies into an\niterated process. When games are finite, this process is guaranteed to\nconverge in finite time. Iterated removal of dominated strategies on\nbinary preference relations is a qualitative variant of the version\nemployed in classical game theory, where cardinal utility values are\nassumed (Leyton-Brown & Shoham\n2008).\n\nA closely related process is iterated removal of weakly\ndominated strategies, where some move a is deleted if\nthere exists a b that outperforms a on some of the\nopponents\u2019 moves, while being at least as good on the remaining\nones. Unlike its strict counterpart, iterated removal of weakly\ndominated strategies suffers from a number of technical and conceptual\nintricacies, such as order dependence of iterated deletion (Samuelson\n1992; Pacuit & Roy 2011).\n\n",
