    "main_text": "\n\n\nPhilosopher, poet, literary and cultural critic, George Santayana is\na principal figure in Classical American Philosophy. His naturalism and\nemphasis on creative imagination were harbingers of important\nintellectual turns on both sides of the Atlantic. He was a naturalist\nbefore naturalism grew popular; he appreciated multiple perfections\nbefore multiculturalism became an issue; he thought of philosophy as\nliterature before it became a theme in American and European scholarly\ncircles; and he managed to naturalize Platonism, update Aristotle,\nfight off idealisms, and provide a striking and sensitive account of\nthe spiritual life without being a religious believer. His Hispanic\nheritage, shaded by his sense of being an outsider in America, captures\nmany qualities of American life missed by insiders, and presents views\nequal to Tocqueville in quality and importance. Beyond philosophy, only\nEmerson may match his literary production. As a public figure, he\nappeared on the front cover of Time (3 February 1936), and his\nautobiography (Persons and Places, 1944) and only novel\n(The Last Puritan, 1936) were the best-selling books in the\nUnited States as Book-of-the-Month Club selections. The novel was\nnominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and Edmund Wilson ranked Persons\nand Places among the few first-rate autobiographies, comparing it\nfavorably to Yeats\u2019s memoirs, The Education of Henry Adams,\nand Proust\u2019s Remembrance of Things Past. Remarkably, Santayana\nachieved this stature in American thought without being an American\ncitizen. He proudly retained his Spanish citizenship throughout his\nlife. Yet, as he readily admitted, it is as an American that his\nphilosophical and literary corpuses are to be judged. Using\ncontemporary classifications, Santayana is the first and foremost\nHispanic-American philosopher.\n",
