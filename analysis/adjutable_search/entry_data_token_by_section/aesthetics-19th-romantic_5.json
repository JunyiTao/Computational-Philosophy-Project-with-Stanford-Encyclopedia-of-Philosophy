    "main_text": "Aesthetics, Epistemology and Metaphysics || Aesthetic Feeling\n3.2 Aesthetic Feeling\n\nIn the introduction to the Critique of the Power of Judgment,\nKant writes that the feeling of pleasure in general, and aesthetic\npleasure in particular, is the only representation that can never\n\u201cbecome an element of cognition at all\u201d (AK 5: 189).\n\nOne might think that feelings are thus placed outside of rationality.\nBut this would be a mistake. On Kant\u2019s picture, aesthetic\nfeeling is rational insofar as it is grounded in a universal mental\nstate that underlies our capacity to judge in general (the free play\nof the imagination and the understanding), and insofar as it is,\nthrough this mental state, responsive to the claims that beautiful\nobjects make on everyone\u2019s satisfaction (AK 5: 282).\nRationality, then, is irreducible to cognition both in the Kantian\nframework and in its romantic inheritance. Aesthetic feeling is\nrational because of its ground and responsiveness to a claim, but\nnon-cognitive insofar as it cannot be subsumed under concepts. Feeling\ndoes not determine any concrete property that its object has\nindependently of subjectivity (as cognition would), but is rather\nresponsive to a relation between a subject and an object. Aesthetic\npleasure, particularly, is a non-determining mode of reflecting on the\nrelation, not between a particular subject and a particular object,\nbut between subjectivity and objectivity as such.\n\nThis rational but non-cognitive nature of feeling, in general, and of\naesthetic feeling, in particular, is perhaps the central feature that\nrenders aesthetic feeling an attractive ingredient in addressing the\nepistemic and metaphysical concerns that occupied the romantics. For\nwhile all cognition is determination through concepts, Kant\u2019s\naesthetics suggests a mode of reflective awareness that is not\ndetermining, but yet a way of being aware of and responsive to aspects\nof the world. This is exactly what the romantics have been looking\nfor\u2014a non-discursive, but rational and normatively governed mode\nof awareness. And they found it in poetry, regarding it as grounded in\nfeeling:\n\n\nNot art and artworks make the artist, but feeling and inspiration and\nimpulse. (F. Schlegel, CF: #63)\n\nPoetry is passion. (Wordsworth, \u201cNote to the Thorn\u201d in LB:\n 136)\n\nAll good poetry [originates in] the spontaneous overflow of powerful\nfeelings. (Wordsworth, Preface to Lyrical Ballads (1800), paragraph\n26, in LB)\n\n\nIf, then, feelings and passions are constitutive of art, and if\naesthetic or poetic feeling is a key ingredient in the pursuit of the\nAbsolute, then philosophy should become poetic and \u201cpoetry and\nphilosophy should be made unified\u201d (F. Schlegel, CF: #115). We\nare now in a position to appreciate that this romantic imperative is\nexplained partly by the view that philosophy cannot be reduced to\nconcepts and propositions, but must also include certain kinds of\naffective mental states. To paraphrase Wittgenstein, discursive\nreasoning comes to an end. \n",
