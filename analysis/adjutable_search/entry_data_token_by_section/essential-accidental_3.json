Some Varieties of Essentialism\n\nA variety of particular forms of essentialism have been advocated.\nStarting at one extreme, there is maximal essentialism. Although\nLeibniz famously held this view, it nearly goes without saying that\nthis view has had relatively few adherents. According to a less\nextreme and correspondingly more popular form of essentialism,\norigin essentialism, an object could not have had a radically\ndifferent origin than it in fact had. The view that a particular table\ncould not have been originally made from completely different material\nthan the material from which it was actually originally made and the\nview that a person could not have originated from a different sperm\nand egg than those from which he or she actually originated are both\nforms of origin essentialism. Origin essentialism has been defended by\nKripke (1972/1980) Salmon (1981), and Forbes (1985), among others.\nAccording to another moderate form of essentialism, sortal\nessentialism, an object could not have been of a radically\ndifferent kind\u2014at least for certain kinds\u2014than it in fact\nis. Both the view that being human (or being human if existent) is an\nessential property of Socrates and the view that Socrates could not\nhave been a credit card account are forms of sortal essentialism. The\nmildest form of essentialism is minimal essentialism. Mackie (2006)\noffers a sustained defense of roughly this view.\n\nIn addition to these sorts of claims about the essential properties of\nordinary individuals, claims about the essential properties of natural\nkinds have figured prominently in the literature, since Kripke\n(1972/1980) and Putnam (1975) made essentialist claims concerning, for\nexample, cats and water. The core intuitions are that in any possible\nworld anything that is not an animal is not a cat and that in any\npossible world anything that is not composed of molecules of\nH2O is not water. Since we discovered empirically that cats\nare animals (and not, for example, robots) and that water is\nH2O (and not some other type of molecule), each of these\nclaims asserts a necessary a posteriori connection between\ntwo properties. In the first case, what is asserted is that it is\nnecessary that anything that is a cat is an animal. In the second\ncase, what is asserted is that necessarily anything that is (a sample\nof) water is composed of molecules of\n H2O.[6]\n It is natural to construe these claims on the model of the\nessentialist claims we have so far considered: it is essential to a\nparticular object, namely the species cat, to be such that\nall of its instances are also instances of the kind animal; it is\nessential to a particular object, namely the kind water, to\nbe such that all samples of it are composed of molecules of\nH2O. Notice that one may hold that cats are essentially\nanimals in the sense that there is a necessary a posteriori\nconnection between the property of being a cat and the property of\nbeing an animal, without holding that any particular cat is\nessentially an animal. In other words, from the fact that it is\nnecessary that every individual that is a cat is an animal, it does\nnot follow that every individual that is in fact a cat is such that\nnecessarily it is an animal. In still other words, this type of\nessentialism about natural kinds does not entail sortal\nessentialism.\n\nIt is perhaps worth mentioning that similar remarks apply to the case\nof a necessary a priori connection between properties. It is\na necessary a priori truth that all mathematicians are\nrational. Following our model, we can say that it is essential to\nthe kind mathematician to be such that all of its instances\nare also instances of the kind rational (thing). It does not\nfollow that Andrew Wiles, who is in fact a mathematician, could not\nfail to be rational\u2014in which case he would also fail to be a\nmathematician. To give an even more perspicuous example, it is a\nnecessary a priori truth that all bachelors are unmarried. It\ndoes not follow that Michael, who is in fact a bachelor, could not be\nmarried.\n\nPhilosophers have thought not only about whether an object has this or\nthat particular property essentially but also about whether an object\nhas a special kind of essential property, an individual\nessence, a property that in addition to being essential to the\nobject is also unique to it in the sense that having that property is\nmodally sufficient for being that object (that is, it is not possible\nthat something distinct from that object has that property). A trivial\nexample of an individual essence is a haecceity or\nthisness of an object, the property of being (identical to)\nthat very object. Some have defended the claim that there are\nsubstantive examples of individual essences. Leibniz famously held\nthat there are, and that they can be given by purely qualitative\n(general) properties. Forbes (1985) also holds that there are\nsubstantive individual essences, but he disagrees with Leibniz that\nthey can be given by purely qualitative properties. Instead, he\nthinks, an individual essence involves non-purely qualitative\n(singular) properties: for example, Socrates\u2019s essence involves\noriginating from the particular sperm and egg from which he actually\noriginated.
