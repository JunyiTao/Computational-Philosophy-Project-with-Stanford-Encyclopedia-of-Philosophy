A causal account differs\nfrom intentionalism in that one can cause something without intending\nto do so. Indeed, one can cause a certain state of affairs even when\none is unaware that one\u2019s actions could do so. One needn\u2019t\nhave grasped the connection between sexual intercourse and pregnancy\nin order to be the cause of a child\u2019s existence.\n\nOne of the attractions of causalism is its promise to account for the\nplausibility of genetic, labor-based, and intentional accounts of\nparenthood. Genetic, gestational, and caregiving relationships\ncontribute to the child\u2019s existence or development, and, in the\ncases that some intentionalists appeal to, the commissioning couple\nare a cause of the child\u2019s existence. Causalism offers to\nexplain its competitors.\n\nBut causal accounts face problems: first, what is meant by\n\u201ccausation\u201d in this context? \u2018But-for\u2019\ncausation is too weak to ground parenthood, because its scope is so\nwide: for example, procreation might not have occurred\n\u2018but-for\u2019 the urgings of would-be grandparents or the\nactions of the match-making friend who introduced the parents. This is\nthe \u201ctoo many parents\u201d problem (Hanna 2019). But it is\nunclear what notion of causation the causal theorist should adopt\ninstead of \u2018but-for\u2019 causation (Blustein 1997). Second,\nwhat implications does the causal account have? Even with a\nsatisfactory account of causation it may be unclear whom the account\nascribes parenthood to in any particular case\u2014or if it is clear\nenough, there is a risk of an ad hoc account of causation tailor-made\nfor this purpose. Concern with the arbitrariness of the causal chain\nby means of which a child may be created leads writers such as\nFuscaldo (2006) to emphasize that what is wanted is not a theory of\ncausation but of agency (see also Austin 2004, 2007). This leads\ncausal theorists back in the direction of intentionalism.\n\nA related problem is that causal accounts often leave it unclear how\ncausal responsibility generates moral responsibility. Sometimes it\nappears that the thought is that procreators, by causing a child to\nexist, have placed it in a needy position and so owe it, as\ncompensation, \u201cprocreative costs.\u201d But these costs are\narguably not equivalent to the weighty responsibilities of parenthood\n(Brake 2010). The question is whether, as a result of causal\nresponsibility for their existence, parents merely owe children repair\nof their needy condition, by fostering survival to adulthood, or\nwhether such \u201cprocreative costs\u201d include a richer set of\nparental responsibilities, such as a duty to love and to make the\nchild \u201ccontent with his condition\u201d (Prusak 2011b, 67).\n\nOne final alternative, as noted above, is a \u2018pluralist\u2019\naccount which allows that more than one of these relations (such as\ncausation or intention) may be sufficient, but not necessary, for\nparenthood (Bayne and Kolers 2003). Pluralist accounts have not yet\nbeen developed in depth.\n\nHaving outlined the main theories of the grounds of parenthood, we\nturn now to questions concerning the morality of being a parent.\n",
