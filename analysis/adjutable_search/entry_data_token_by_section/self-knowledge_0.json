    "main_text": "The Distinctiveness of Self-Knowledge\n1. The Distinctiveness of Self-Knowledge\n\nWhat is special about self-knowledge, compared to knowledge in other\ndomains? Self-knowledge is thought to differ from other sorts of\nknowledge in one or more of the following ways.\n\nSelf-knowledge is especially secure, epistemically.\nSelf-knowledge is (sometimes) acquired by use of an exclusively\nfirst-personal method.\nOur capacity for self-knowledge reflects our cognitive\nagency.\nOne\u2019s pronouncements about one\u2019s own mental states\ncarry a special authority or presumption of truth.\n\n\nThe differences between these are subtle. Statement (1) identifies the\ndistinctive feature of self-knowledge as the epistemic status of a\ncertain class of beliefs, whereas statement (2) identifies it by the\nmethod one uses in forming these beliefs. Statement (3) emphasizes the\nsubject\u2019s agency, typically in relation to attitudes like\nbeliefs and intentions, which are sensitive to reasons. Statement (4)\nfocuses on the way that self-ascriptions of mental states, such as\nsaying \u201cI\u2019m in pain\u201d, are treated by others.\nStatements (1) and (2) are ways of cashing out the notion that we\nenjoy \u201cprivileged access\u201d to our own mental states. Only\nthese first two statements construe the distinctive feature of\nself-knowledge as plainly epistemic; however, most who endorse (3)\nalso claim that this agential relation grounds a special epistemic\nrelation. A minority of philosophers denies that self-knowledge is\nspecial at all (see Section 2).\n",
