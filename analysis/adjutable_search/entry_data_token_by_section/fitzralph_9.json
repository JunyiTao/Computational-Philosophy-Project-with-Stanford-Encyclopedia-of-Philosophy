    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Divine Foreknowledge and future contingents\n6.3 Divine Foreknowledge and future contingents\n\n\nOne of the topics which exercised the minds of FitzRalph and his\ncontemporaries was the topic of the revelation of future contingents.\nIndeed, FitzRalph discussed it on three separate occasions. His first\ntreatment occurs in the Sentences commentary, where he\nconsiders the matter so important that he promises his audience he will\nreturn to it He kept this promise a few months later when he gave his\nQuaestio biblica and before he left for Paris in October, 1329\n(Genest 1991) . Again, he returned to the problem in his Summa de\nquaestionibus Armenorum, where the matter is treated in a dialogue\nform.\n\n\nThe specific way in which FitzRalph addresses the problem is in terms\nof the revelation of future contingents. Given that future contingents\nhave a determinate truth\u2014namely, that they will happen and cannot\nnot happen\u2014how can their truth, as known by God, be revealed by\nhim to a created intellect without their losing their contingency? As\nLeff points out, the problem as set out by his contemporaries was\nwhether God\u2019s knowledge of the future was different from that of\nthe present and the past (Leff 1963: 40). According to Wodeham,\nBuckingham, and Holcot, God\u2019s knowledge about the future must be\nrelated to the contingency of the future, and, therefore, this\nknowledge is of a different kind from God\u2019s knowledge of the past\nand present. FitzRalph accepts the distinction, seeking to defend his\nposition as being consonant with Augustine in the 83 Questions\nand De Trinitate. It was, in fact, a position rejected by\nBradwardine and Gregory of Rimini.\n\n\nFrom the sources which we have FitzRalph is the first to devote an\nentire question to the problem of the revelation of future contingents\nand that it is no less remarkable that it is six times the length of\nhis question on divine foreknowledge (Genest 1991: 240). Again,\nFitzRalph\u2019s treatment of the topic marks a turning point in the\nhistory of the problem, as is clear from comparing it what Ockham had\nwritten on the topic just before 1324 (in his Quodlibet IV,\nqu. 4). Whereas Ockham dealt with the problem in 800 words,\nFitzRalph\u2014in a sign of the growing complexity of the\nproblem\u2014writes 20,000 words on the matter. While Ockham sought to\nremove all necessity from the proposition, \u201cThis was\nrevealed\u201d, by seeking to disassociate it from any temporal\nimplication on God\u2019s part, FitzRalph, without contesting this\nthesis (then nearly universally accepted), has to resolve a series of\ndifficulties that this thesis leaves open. Against the possibility of a\nrevelation of the future, FitzRalph lists fourteen arguments, which\nGenest examines in some detail. One of the central themes that emerge\nis a disjunction between the certitude of revelation and the conditions\nof acting for a creature, conditions which presuppose that in order to\nbe free, there must be a certain ignorance of the future on the part of\nthe creature. To take but one example: if God reveals to a just man\nthat he will be damned, should he pray for his salvation? FitzRalph\nmakes a distinction between a prophesy through which people are\ndeceived, on the one hand, and lying on the other; thus a person may be\ndeceived by the prophesy and yet God did not lie to them.\n\n\nFor FitzRalph God is good and does not act arbitrarily or\nirrationally. The revelation of free actions is contingent so that, if\nGod should reveal to someone that he will be ultimately damned, this\ncannot relate to the person\u2019s present state of grace but to\nactions freely undertaken in the future. This is because, for\nFitzRalph, if someone were to act necessarily his or her actions would\nbe neither just nor unjust. Someone might freely sin even if the future\nconsequences were revealed to him, but that does not mean that he is\ncompelled to sin.\n\n\nWith the exception of the final argument, all of the quod\nnons are based upon \u201ccases\u201d or particular\ncircumstances (in isto casu, in casu posito) (Genest\n1991: 242\u20133). Some are examples taken from Scripture, others we might\ncall scholastic \u201cthought experiments,\u201d but most of them are\naccompanied by cases of conscience. According to Genest, many of\nthem had already been put forward by his predecessors and many are to\nbe found in the Lectura of the Franciscan John of Rodington,\nwho read the Sentences at roughly the same time as FitzRalph;\nRodington\u2019s treatment is briefer, however (Genest 1991: 243). The\nstock of hypotheses must have been more or less complete when FitzRalph\ncomposed his question, but it is the breadth of the treatment which\nmarks FitzRalph\u2019s text as an important witness to the debate at\nOxford at the end of the 1320s. A sign of this importance is the\nattention given to FitzRalph\u2019s text by Wodeham in his Lectura\noxoniensis (1333\u20131334), where he devotes five long questions\nto the topic (Sent. III, qu. 5\u20139). Again, when Holcot\ncame to deal with the matter, he practically repeated what FitzRalph\nhad said.\n",
