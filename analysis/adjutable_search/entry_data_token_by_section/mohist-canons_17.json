    "main_text": "Argumentation and Logic || Methods of Argumentation in the \u201cLesser Selection\u201d\n7.2 Methods of Argumentation in the \u201cLesser Selection\u201d\n\nWe quoted the opening paragraph of the \u201cLesser Selection\u201d\n above:[26]\n The text depicts disputation as the general method of achieving\nunderstanding in virtually all areas of inquiry. Specifically, it is\nthe means by which we can determine \u201cwhat is so\u201d of\nthings\u2014what terms are predicable of them, and thus what claims\nare correct\u2014and \u201csort out parallels\u201d between various\ntypes of statements, thus determining what relations between\nstatements might provide good grounds for accepting one statement on\nthe basis of another. The text continues by introducing basic concepts\nand principles of disputation: \n\nBy names (m\u00edng \u540d), present stuff\n(sh\u00ed \u5be6); by expressions (c\u00ed\n\u8fad), put across thoughts (y\u00ec \u610f); by\nexplanations (shu\u014d \u8aaa), bring out reasons\n(g\u00f9 \u6545). Accept and propose on the basis of\nkinds (l\u00e8i \u985e). Having it in our case, we do not\nreject it in the other\u2019s; lacking it in our case, we do not\ndemand it in the other\u2019s.\n\n\nFrom the perspective of comparative philosophy, this statement is of\nfar-reaching significance. Here, in an explicit, systematic\npresentation of their theory of dialectics, the most logically\ninclined thinkers in the Chinese tradition tell us directly that\nassertions are put forth and accepted or rejected on the basis of\nanalogical extension, by deeming things to be of the same kind or not.\nThey add a principle of fairness, stipulating that the same grounds or\ndemands be applied whether evaluating our own claims or the\nopponent\u2019s. They thus indicate that their dialectics is\nprimarily not the study of deductive logic, or formally valid\ninference. It is the study of fair or unbiased analogical persuasion.\nInterestingly, this is an instance of the explicit study of logic in a\nculture reflecting prevailing patterns of reasoning across other\nfields. Early Chinese mathematics and science are likewise based on\nanalogical reasoning and taxonomy, rather than on the model of the\ndeductive system that dominates ancient Greek thought. \n\nThe passage is also significant for what it tells us about the\ncomponents and structure of disputation. Three sorts of linguistic\nunits are mentioned, all of them explained in terms of function, not\nstructure. \u201cNames,\u201d or words, are used to\n\u201cpresent\u201d or talk about things. \u201cExpressions\u201d\nare used to express thoughts and thus to make assertions.\n\u201cExpressions\u201d overlap functionally with what we would\nidentify as sentences. However, a sentence is a grammatical unit,\ncomposed of a subject and a predicate. The Mohists do not characterize\nexpressions as grammatical units, nor as comprising a subject and\npredicate. They see them simply as strings of names that enable us to\nexpress thoughts. Since in classical Chinese a predicate term standing\nalone can express a thought, presumably such a term can also be an\n\u201cexpression.\u201d \u201cExplanations\u201d are used to\nelucidate the reasons for drawing distinctions one way or another.\nFunctionally, an \u201cexplanation\u201d is roughly analogous to an\nargument, or, more precisely, to the premises of an argument, in that\nit serves to support an assertion by giving reasons. However, an\nexplanation is not described as having any particular structure, nor\nany particular logical relation to an assertion other than giving\nreasons for it. \n\nThe text next introduces several further notions, including that of\n\u201cemulation,\u201d or the use of models to distinguish\nsh\u00ec/f\u0113i, before explaining four standard\nrhetorical techniques used in disputation. The four techniques and the\ntext\u2019s explanation of them are as\n follows:[27]\n\n\n\nAnalogy (p\u00ec \u8b6c): \u201cPresenting other\nthings and using them to clarify it.\u201d \n\u201cParalleling\u201d (m\u00f3u \u4f94):\n\u201cPlacing expressions side by side and jointly proceeding.\u201d\n\n\u201cPulling\u201d (yu\u00e1n \u63f4):\n\u201cSaying, \u2018You are so, how is it that I alone cannot be\nso?\u2019\u201d \n\u201cPushing\u201d (tu\u012b \u63a8): \u201cOn the\ngrounds that what they don\u2019t accept is the same as what they do\naccept, propose it.\u201d \n\n\n\nScholars have debated the relationship between these four techniques,\nsome suggesting that they are a sequence of steps employed in the\nprocess of establishing a claim, others that they are inference\nprocedures. It is unlikely they form a fixed sequence of steps, since\nrhetorically in many cases giving an analogy might make presenting\nparallel claims unnecessary, or \u201cpulling\u201d (appealing to\nthe opponent\u2019s precedent) alone might be sufficient to establish\none\u2019s point. Probably there is no fixed relation between the\nfour, and disputers may apply one or more of them as needed to make\ntheir case. Frequently, using just one may be sufficient. \n\nA key point to note about the four techniques, relating back to the\nprinciple that we \u201caccept and propose on the basis of\nkinds,\u201d is that all are specifically procedures for analogical\nargumentation, aimed at distinguishing similarities and differences\nbetween kinds of things and assertions about them. This point is\nunderscored by the next line of the text, which describes the two\nstandard responses to the four rhetorical moves: \u201c\u2018This is\nlike what\u2019s been said\u2019 is \u2018the same.\u2019\n\u2018How can I call it that?\u2019 is\n\u2018different.\u2019\u201d However, the four techniques apply\nanalogical judgment and reasoning in different ways. A concise way of\ncapturing the differences between them is that analogy is grounded in\nsimilarities between things, \u201cparalleling\u201d in similarities\nin phrasing, and \u201cpulling\u201d and \u201cpushing\u201d in\nsimilarities between the discursive commitments of the two\nopponents\u2014between claims one side has previously accepted and\nanalogous claims the other side now seeks to\n establish.[28]\n\nA further point is that these techniques\u2014along with the general\nMohist practice of citing models or exemplars to support one\u2019s\nclaims\u2014are not the proprietary methods of the Mohist school. As\nany reader of the ancient literature will notice, three of them, at\nleast, are standard rhetorical moves employed by classical Chinese\nthinkers and debaters of all stripes. (\u201cParalleling\u201d seems\nto be used less frequently, but examples can be found nonetheless.)\nThe Mozi contains numerous arguments matching these\ndescriptions. But so too do the scores of essays and anecdotes\ncollected in The Annals of L\u00fc Buwei (L\u00fcshi\nChunqiu), for instance.\n Mencius,\n not a thinker one normally associates with the study of logic, is\ndepicted as using them regularly (though not always correctly or\nintelligibly; see Mencius 6A:3). The four moves are thus\nprobably representative of the art of disputation as generally\npracticed in the 3rd century B.C.E. \n\nAnalogy (p\u00ec \u8b6c) is the easiest of the four to\nexplain. It refers to drawing an analogy between one case and another,\nmore familiar or easily understood one, in order to clarify the case\nat hand and presumably to establish a claim about it. It is based on\nan analogical inference from a similarity between selected features of\nthe analogue and features of the case at hand to some further\nsimilarity between the two. Analogies are used regularly in\nargumentation throughout the Mozi and in the \u201cLesser\nSelection\u201d as well. \n\nTwo of the techniques, \u201cpulling\u201d and\n\u201cpushing,\u201d are technically forms of argument ad\nhominem, in that the immediate basis for an assertion is the\nopponent\u2019s commitment to a similar assertion concerning what we\ntake to be a similar case. Rhetorically, these two moves attempt to\nsupport a claim not directly by appeal to features of the thing we are\ntalking about, nor its similarity to something else, as in analogy,\nbut by appeal to a claim the opponent has already accepted.\n\u201cPulling\u201d refers to citing the opponent\u2019s precedent\nin accepting an assertion about something and challenging the opponent\nto explain how the precedent is distinct from the case at hand. It is\ntypically signaled by a rhetorical question asking how the present\ncase is any different from the precedent. If no explanation is\nforthcoming, a similar assertion about the case at hand stands.\n\u201cPulling\u201d thus amounts to shifting the burden of argument\nto the other side and inviting them to try to block an implicit\nanalogical inference from the precedent to the case at hand by showing\nhow the two are actually dissimilar. \u201cPushing\u201d refers to\nproposing a claim about something on the basis of similarity to\nanother claim the opponent has already accepted. In early Chinese\nthought, the term for \u201cpushing,\u201d tu\u012b\n\u63a8, is typically used to refer to analogical extension, and\n\u201cpushing\u201d indeed involves an extension from one claim to a\nnew one on grounds that the cases are similar. \n\nSince \u201cpulling\u201d and \u201cpushing\u201d are primarily\nad hominem techniques used in face-to-face debate, not in\nargumentative writing, they appear in early Chinese texts mainly in\ncontexts depicting speakers engaged in debate (bi\u00e0n\n\u8faf) or attempting to persuade each other of something. The\n\u201cLesser Selection\u201d itself contains two examples of\n\u201cpushing,\u201d one of which is presented in\n section 7.3.\n Clear-cut examples of \u201cpulling\u201d in the Mozi are\ndifficult to find. What we generally see instead are instances in\nwhich Mozi challenges the audience to explain how a case under\ndiscussion is any different from a simpler, analogous case. For\ninstance, in the third \u201cHeaven\u2019s Intention\u201d essay,\nMozi cites the case of people who \u201cdo not know the difference\nbetween black and white,\u201d for on seeing a small amount of black,\nthey say it is \u201cblack,\u201d while on seeing a large amount,\nthey say it is \u201cwhite.\u201d He compares this to the case of\nwarlike rulers who forbid murder\u2014the killing of a single\nperson\u2014yet deem it right for their soldiers to kill as many\npeople of a neighboring state as possible. Of this way of\ndistinguishing right from wrong, he asks, \u201cHow is this any\ndifferent from confusing the difference between white and\n black?\u201d[29]\n\n\nA more unambiguous example of \u201cpulling\u201d comes from the\nfamous dialogue between Mencius and King Xuan in section 1A7 of the\nMencius. Mencius argues that the king has the ability to be a\ngenuine king\u2014and not merely a king in name only\u2014because of\nthe compassion he displayed in sparing a frightened ox from\nsacrificial slaughter. He offers two examples of people who claim to\nbe able to perform a difficult feat but not an easy, related task: a\nperson who claims to be able to lift a heavy weight but not a feather\nand one who claims to be able to see the tip of an autumn hair but not\na cartload of firewood. The king agrees that such claims would be\nunacceptable. Mencius then points out that the king\u2019s\nbenevolence is sufficient to reach animals\u2014a\n\u201cdifficult\u201d feat, he thinks, insofar as feeling compassion\nfor an ox comes less naturally to us than feeling it for other\nhumans\u2014yet the benefits of this benevolence do not reach his\npeople\u2014an \u201ceasy\u201d task, since being moved to help\nother people should be easier for us than being moved to help animals.\nHe then asks how the king\u2019s case is any different from the\npreceding examples. The implicit conclusion is that the claim that the\nKing is unable to benefit his people is as unacceptable as a strong\nman saying he cannot lift a feather. Thus the king\u2019s failure is\nnot due to a lack of ability. \n\nThe remaining technique, \u201cparalleling\u201d\n(m\u00f3u \u4f94), or presenting parallel, syntactically\nanalogous utterances, is the most intriguing of the four and the most\ndifficult and controversial to interpret. A variety of accounts have\nbeen\n proposed.[30]\n The interpretive difficulty is due partly to the unfamiliarity of the\ntechnique, which has no obvious counterpart in other logical\ntraditions, partly to the absence of any clearly specified examples in\nthe text, and partly to the terminology the Mohists use to explain it.\nTo paraphrase the text, \u201cparalleling\u201d is lining up\nexpressions side-by-side and jointly proceeding with them all\n(b\u01d0 c\u00ed \u00e9r j\u00f9 x\u00edng\n\u6bd4\u8fad\u800c\u4ff1\u884c). This description is\nextremely general, telling us little more than that paralleling\ninvolves some form of linguistic comparison in which strings of\nutterances are extended or developed in some parallel or analogous\nway. What exactly is referred to by \u201cexpressions\u201d\n(c\u00ed \u8fad) is vague, since, as we saw above, the\nonly explanation the Mohists give is functional, that\n\u201cexpressions\u201d are used to express thoughts.\n\u201cExpressions\u201d could conceivably refer to anything from a\nphrase to a sentence to several sentences. \u201cProceeding\u201d\n(x\u00edng \u884c) is also ambiguous.\n\u201cProceed\u201d is used in relation to semantics in two other\nplaces in the Dialectics, Canons B1 and B72. In both, it\nseems to refer to \u201cproceeding\u201d to using a general term\nconsistently of similar kinds of things. So \u201cproceeding\u201d\nin the present context could refer to going on to make consistent,\nunproblematic utterances. But perhaps it might refer to drawing\ninferences or simply to uttering strings of interrelated\n\u201cexpressions.\u201d Even the conjunction \u201cand\u201d\n(er \u800c) here is open to different interpretations, as\nit could refer to a two-step process of first comparing expressions\nand then jointly proceeding with them or, more likely, to a single\nstep of jointly proceeding with them in parallel. \n\nLet me tentatively suggest that the following, relatively simple\ninterpretation may have the greatest explanatory\n value:[31]\n \u201cparalleling\u201d (m\u00f3u \u4f94) refers very\ngenerally to presenting a series of syntactically parallel utterances,\none or more of which are used to argue by analogy that one or more\nothers should be accepted. The formal similarity between the structure\nor phrasing of the utterances is supposed to lead us to also see an\nanalogical relation between the things or situations described, such\nthat if we accept some of the parallels, we should accept them all.\nThe following is one example of paralleling: \n\nWhite horses are horses; riding white horses is riding horses.\n\nBlack horses are horses; riding black horses is riding horses.\n\n\nOn the proposed interpretation, the first utterance above could be\ntaken as grounds for asserting the second. Alternatively, both\nutterances together could be taken as grounds for asserting a further\nparallel utterance: \n\nBrown horses are horses; riding brown horses is riding horses.\n\n\n\nAs the Mohists understand paralleling, these examples could also\nsupport utterances unrelated to riding horses, such as the following:\n\n\nYellow dogs are dogs; feeding yellow dogs is feeding dogs.\n\nOxen are animals; feeding oxen is feeding animals.\n\n\n\nThe point of paralleling is to employ similarity in syntax or phrasing\nto persuade us to accept new, parallel utterances. The formal\nparallelism is intended to guide us to recognize that the cases in the\nutterances about brown horses, yellow dogs, and oxen are analogous to\nthose in the ones about white and black horses.\n\nThe form of the above examples is \u201cx is y,\nFx is Fy,\u201d where \u201cF\u201d is a\npredicate applied to both x and y. Paralleling is\nnot limited to utterances of this form,\n however.[32]\n On the basis of the Mohists\u2019 discussion in the \u201cLesser\nSelection,\u201d paralleling can be used with a variety of structural\npatterns, including the following, for\n example:[33]\n\n\n\nReading books isn\u2019t books; liking reading books is liking books.\n\nCockfights aren\u2019t gamecocks; liking cockfighting is liking\ngamecocks.\n\nBeing about to fall into a well isn\u2019t falling into a well;\nstopping someone about to fall into a well is stopping someone from\nfalling into a well.\n\nBeing about to go out the door isn\u2019t going out the door;\nstopping someone about to go out the door is stopping someone from\ngoing out the door.\n\n\nBy analogy to this list of parallel utterances, the Mohists contend we\nshould also accept the following:\n\n\nBeing about to die young isn\u2019t dying young; stopping someone\nfrom being about to die young is stopping someone from dying young.\n\nHolding there is fate isn\u2019t fate; rejecting holding there is\nfate is rejecting fate.\n\n\nThe litany of parallel examples is intended to prime us to accept the\nnew, parallel utterances and to see them as identifying further cases\nin which, although x is not y, Fx is\nFy. \n\nThe latter half of the \u201cLesser Selection\u201d presents a\ntaxonomy of cases in which the Mohists contend that syntactic\nparallels between utterances can indeed help justify similar, parallel\nutterances, along with examples of cases in which they cannot. One of\nthe text\u2019s central claims is that parallelism\u2014and indeed\nall four of the rhetorical techniques introduced\u2014is potentially\nmisleading and can be used only with meticulous attention to the\nsemantic grounds underlying the correct use of names and expressions.\nThis claim underscores the nature of the logical inquiries in the\n\u201cLesser Selection.\u201d The text is not exploring formally\nvalid, truth-functional inference procedures, but examining ways in\nwhich analogical inferences\u2014in particular those based on\nsyntactic parallelism\u2014do or do not yield what the writers\nconsider semantically correct utterances. When they do not, the\nMohists reject the results by appeal to what they take to be basic\nnorms governing the semantics of names and expressions, which they see\nas more fundamental than syntactical or formal features. As this\ncharacterization suggests, although their observations about the\nmisleading nature of syntactic parallels may have helped point them\naway from any significant study of formal, truth-functional logic,\ntheir inquiries were oriented in a different direction from the start.\n\n",
