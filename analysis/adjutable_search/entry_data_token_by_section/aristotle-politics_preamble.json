    "main_text": "\n\nAristotle (b. 384\u2013d. 322 BCE), was a Greek philosopher,\nlogician, and scientist. Along with his teacher Plato, Aristotle is\ngenerally regarded as one of the most influential ancient thinkers in\na number of philosophical fields, including political theory.\nAristotle was born in Stagira in northern Greece, and his father was a\ncourt physician to the king of Macedon. As a young man he studied in\nPlato\u2019s Academy in Athens. After Plato\u2019s death he left Athens to\nconduct philosophical and biological research in Asia Minor and\nLesbos, and he was then invited by King Philip II of Macedon to tutor\nhis young son, Alexander the Great. Soon after Alexander succeeded his\nfather, consolidated the conquest of the Greek city-states, and\nlaunched the invasion of the Persian Empire. Aristotle returned as a\nresident alien to Athens, and was a close friend of Antipater, the\nMacedonian viceroy. At this time (335\u2013323 BCE) he wrote, or at\nleast worked on, some of his major treatises, including the\nPolitics. When Alexander died suddenly, Aristotle had to flee\nfrom Athens because of his Macedonian connections, and he died soon\nafter. Aristotle\u2019s life seems to have influenced his political thought\nin various ways: his interest in biology seems to be reflected in\nthe naturalism of his politics; his interest in comparative politics\nand his qualified sympathies for democracy as well as monarchy may\nhave been encouraged by his travels and experience of diverse\npolitical systems; he reacts critically to his teacher Plato, while\nborrowing extensively, from Plato\u2019s Republic,\nStatesman, and Laws; and his own Politics\nis intended to guide rulers and statesmen, reflecting the high\npolitical circles in which he moved.\n",
