    "main_text": "Concepts of information || Information in Colloquial Speech\n1.1 Information in Colloquial Speech\n\nThe term \u201cinformation\u201d in colloquial speech is currently\npredominantly used as an abstract mass-noun used to denote any amount\nof data, code or text that is stored, sent, received or manipulated in\nany medium. The lack of preciseness and the universal usefulness of\nthe term \u201cinformation\u201d go hand in hand. In our society, in\nwhich we explore reality by means of instruments and installations of\never increasing complexity (telescopes, cyclotrons) and communicate\nvia more advanced media (newspapers, radio, television, SMS, the\nInternet), it is useful to have an abstract mass-noun for the\n\u201cstuff\u201d that is created by the instruments and that\n\u201cflows\u201d through these media. Historically this general\nmeaning emerged rather late and seems to be associated with the rise\nof mass media and intelligence agencies (Devlin & Rosenberg 2008;\nAdriaans & van Benthem 2008b).\n\nIn present colloquial speech the term information is used in various\nloosely defined and often even conflicting ways. Most people, for\ninstance, would consider the following inference prima facie\nto be valid:\n\nIf I get the information that p then I know that p.\n\nThe same people would probably have no problems with the statement\nthat \u201cSecret services sometimes distribute false\ninformation\u201d, or with the sentence \u201cThe information\nprovided by the witnesses of the accident was vague and\nconflicting\u201d. The first statement implies that information\nnecessarily is true, while the other statements allow for the\npossibility that information is false, conflicting and vague . In\neveryday communication these inconsistencies do not seem to create\ngreat trouble and in general it is clear from the pragmatic context\nwhat type of information is designated. These examples suffice to\nargue that references to our intuitions as speakers of the English\nlanguage are of little help in the development of a rigorous\nphilosophical theory of information. There seems to be no pragmatic\npressure in everyday communication to converge to a more exact\ndefinition of the notion of information.\n",
