    "main_text": "Applications of Many-Valued Logic || Applications to Mathematics\n5.  History of Many-Valued Logic\n Many-valued logic as a separate subject was created by the Polish\nlogician and philosopher \u0141ukasiewicz (1920), and developed first\nin Poland. His first intention was to use a third, additional truth\nvalue for \u201cpossible\u201d, and to model in this way the\nmodalities \u201cit is necessary that\u201d and \u201cit is\npossible that\u201d. This intended application to modal logic did not\nmaterialize. The outcome of these investigations are, however, the\n\u0141ukasiewicz systems, and a series of theoretical results\nconcerning these systems.\n\n\nEssentially parallel to the \u0141ukasiewicz approach, the American\nmathematician Post (1921) introduced the basic idea of additional truth\ndegrees, and applied it to problems of the representability of\nfunctions.\n\n\nLater on, G\u00f6del (1932) tried to understand intuitionistic logic\nin terms of many truth degrees. The outcome was the family of\nG\u00f6del systems, and a result, namely, that intuitionistic logic\ndoes not have a characteristic logical matrix with only finitely many\ntruth degrees. A few years later, Jaskowski (1936) constructed an\ninfinite valued characteristic matrix for intuitionistic logic. It\nseems, however, that the truth degrees of this matrix do not have a\nnice and simple intuitive interpretation.\n\n\nA philosophical application of 3-valued logic to the discussion of\nparadoxes was proposed by the Russian logician Bochvar (1938), and a\nmathematical one to partial function and relations by the American\nlogician Kleene (1938). Much later Kleene\u2019s connectives also became\nphilosophically interesting as a technical tool to determine fixed\npoints in the revision theory of truth initiated by Kripke (1975).\n\n\nThe 1950s saw (i) an analytical characterization of the class of\ntruth degree functions definable in the infinite valued propositional\n\u0141ukasiewicz system by McNaughton (1951), (ii) a completeness proof\nfor the same system by Chang (1958, 1959) introducing the notion of\nMV-algebra and a more traditional one by Rose/Rosser (1958), as well as\n(iii) a completeness proof for the infinite valued propositional\nG\u00f6del system by Dummett (1959). The 1950s also saw an approach of\nSkolem (1957) toward proving the consistency of set theory in the realm\nof infinite valued logic.\n\n\nIn the 1960s, Scarpellini (1962) made clear that the first-order\ninfinite valued \u0141ukasiewicz system is not (recursively)\naxiomatizable. Hay (1963) as well as Belluce/Chang (1963) proved that\nthe addition of one infinitary inference rule leads to an\naxiomatization of \\(\\rL_{\\infty}\\). And Horn (1969) presented a\ncompleteness proof for first-order infinite valued G\u00f6del logic.\nBesides these developments inside pure many-valued logic, Zadeh (1965)\nstarted an (application oriented) approach toward the formalization of\nvague notions by generalized set theoretic means, which soon was\nrelated by Goguen (1968/69) to philosophical applications, and which\nlater on inspired also a lot of theoretical considerations inside\nMVL.\n\n\nThe 1970s mark a period of restricted activity in pure many-valued\nlogic. There was, however, a lot of work in the closely related area of\n(computer science) applications of vague notions formalized as fuzzy\nsets, initiated e.g. by Zadeh (1975, 1979). And there was an important\nextension of MVL by a graded notion of inference and entailment in\nPavelka (1979).\n\n\nIn the 1980s, fuzzy sets and their applications remained a hot topic\nthat called for theoretical foundations by methods of many-valued\nlogic. In addition, there were the first complexity results e.g.\nconcerning the set of logically valid formulas in first-order infinite\nvalued \u0141ukasiewicz logic, by Ragaz (1983). Mundici (1986) started\na deeper study of MV-algebras.\n\n\nThese trends have continued since the 1980s. Research has included\napplications of MVL to fuzzy set theory and their applications,\ndetailed investigations of algebraic structures related to systems of\nMVL, the study of graded notions of entailment, and investigations into\ncomplexity issues for different problems in systems of MVL. This\nresearch was complemented by interesting work on proof theory, on\nautomated theorem proving, by different applications in artificial\nintelligence matters, and by a detailed study of infinite valued\nsystems based on t-norms \u2013 which now often are called\n(mathematical) fuzzy logics.\n",
