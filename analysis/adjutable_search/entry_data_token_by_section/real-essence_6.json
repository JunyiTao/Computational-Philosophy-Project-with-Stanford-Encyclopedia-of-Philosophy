Scientific disciplines categorize the objects they study\ninto kinds. To say that a kind is natural is to say\nthat a grouping of similar individuals exists independently of human\ndecisions. The hope of each scientific discipline is to identify as\nmany natural kinds as possible within their domain and to determine\ntheir properties accurately. To this end, we create scientific\ntaxonomies, like the periodic table of elements, the phylogenetic\ntree, etc., to organize the kinds we have identified and to study\ntheir properties. On the face of it, the question of whether there are\nnatural kinds in Locke seems to be the same as the question of whether\nthere are species, and as we saw above (in \u00a7\u00a71\u20133)\nLocke denies that there are natural species. However, it is possible\nto distinguish between a species (a classification humans make based\non observed similarities) and a natural kind (a grouping that occurs\nnaturally and independently of human naming practices). Locke is\nclearly aware of this distinction, so it is possible that what he has\nsaid about sorting and nominal essences only reveals what he thinks\nabout nominal essences and our practice of sorting, which is a\nsemantic issue, not about the metaphysics of nature.\n\nTo be sure, there are passages in the Essay that seem to\nindicate that Locke was a natural kind realist even if he was a\nconventionalist about taxonomical practices. For example:\n\n\nThe other, and more rational Opinion, is of those, who look on all\nnatural Things to have a real, but unknown Constitution of their\ninsensible Parts, from which flow those sensible Qualities, which\nserve us to distinguish them one from another, according as we have\nOccasion to rank them into sorts, under common Denominations.\n(III.iii.17)\n\n\nIn other words, one might argue, if real essences cause the observable\nqualities of bodies, and we sort things into species based on\nobservable similarities, then if we assume that similarities among the\nreal essences always results in similar observable qualities, and\nsimilar observable qualities are always caused by similar real\nessences, there is reason to think that Locke assumed that our nominal\nessences track, at least to some degree, real kinds in nature.\n\nThere are places in the Essay where Locke seems to think\nalong these lines. In III.vi.36 he says \u201cNature makes many\nparticular Things, which do agree one with another, in many\nsensible Qualities, and probably too, in their internal frame and\nConstitution.\u201d In a letter to Molyneux, Locke says:\n\n\nI hope I have no where said, there is no such sort of creatures in\nnature as birds; if I have, it is both contrary to the truth and to my\nopinion. This I do say, that there are real constitutions in things\nfrom whence these simple ideas flow, which we observ\u2019d combined\nin them. And this I farther say, that there are real distinctions and\ndifferences in those real constitutions one from another; whereby they\nare distinguished one from another, whether we think of them or name\nthem or no. (Locke, Works, vol. IV, pp. 305\u20136)\n\n\nIndeed, there are passages where Locke speaks of the\n\u201cimperfection\u201d of our species ideas and the need to make\nthem better conform to nature. For example, in III.xi.24 he says\nthat:\n\n\nAnd therefore in Substances, we are not always to rest in the ordinary\ncomplex Idea, commonly received as the signification of that\nWord, but must go a little farther, and enquire into the Nature and\nProperties of the Things themselves, and thereby perfect, as much as\nwe can, our Ideas of their distinct Species\u2026\n\n\nThere is no reason, so one may argue, to suspect that our species\nideas could be either perfected or imperfect if there is no natural\nkind archetype. On the other hand, there is some evidence that Locke\nanticipated this kind of account and rejected it. For example, he\nsays:\n\n\n\u2026That we find many of the Individuals that are ranked into one\nSort, called by one common Name, and so received as being of one\nSpecies, have yet Qualities depending on their real\nConstitutions, as far different one from another, as from others, from\nwhich they are accounted to differ specifically. This, as it\nis easy to be observed by all, who have to do with natural Bodies; so\nChymists especially are often, by sad Experience, convinced of it,\nwhen they, sometimes in vain, seek for the same Qualities in one\nparcel of Sulphur, Antimony, or Vitriol, which they have found in\nothers. For though they are Bodies of the same Species,\nhaving the same nominal Essence, under the same Name; yet do\nthey often, upon severe ways of examination, betray Qualities so\ndifferent one from another, as to frustrate the Expectation and Labour\nof very wary Chymists. But if Things were distinguished into\nSpecies, according to their real Essences, it would be as\nimpossible to find different Properties in any two individual\nSubstances of the same Species, as it is to find different\nProperties in two Circles, or two equilateral Triangles.\n(III.vi.8)\n\n\nThis argument is a modus tollens: if the members of a\nnominally defined species had the same type of real essence, then they\nshould all exhibit the same qualities (including those not included in\nthe nominal essence), but they do not exhibit all of the same\nqualities, therefore they do not all have the same type of real\nessence.\n\nThis question of whether real essences could be the foundation of\nnatural kinds for Locke is as old as the Essay itself. Both\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Edward Stillingfleet, Lord Bishop of\nWorcester, point out that Locke\u2019s position on real essences\nseems to entail that there are natural kinds based on similarities\namong the real essences. As Leibniz put it in his critique of the\nEssay entitled New Essays on Human Understanding\n(1704),\n\n\n[i]t is true that we cannot define a species in terms of something\nwhich is unknown to us [e.g., real essences]; but the outer features\nserve in place of it\u2026. (Leibniz 1704, p. 311)\n\n\nLater, he reiterates this point:\n\n\n[when] I think of a body which is at once yellow, fusible and\nresistant to cupellation, I am thinking of a body whose specific\nessence, though hidden from me within it, gives rise to these\nqualities and reveals itself, at least confusedly, through them.\n(Leibniz 1704, p. 405)\n\n\nLocke died before Leibniz\u2019s New Essays on Human\nUnderstanding were published (they were not published until 1765,\nsixty-one years after Locke\u2019s death and nearly fifty years after\nLeibniz\u2019s death), so we do not have Locke\u2019s response to\nLeibniz\u2019s arguments, nevertheless, Stillingfleet gave a similar\nargument and we have Locke\u2019s replies to him.\n\nLike Leibniz, Stillingfleet appeals to the concept of real essence as\na \u201cnatural kind\u201d concept, claiming that there are types of\nreal essences, and belonging to the same natural kind is a function of\npossessing the same kind of real essence:\n\n\nBut in this one sun there is a real essence, and not a mere nominal or\nabstracted essence; but suppose there were more suns; would not each\nof them have the real essence of the sun? For what is it makes the\nsecond sun to be a true sun, but having the same real essence with the\nfirst? If it were but a nominal essence, then the second would have\nnothing but the name. (Locke, Works, vol. IV, p. 83. Here\nLocke is quoting from Stillingfleet\u2019s Discourse in\nVindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity, where the latter\ncriticizes Locke\u2019s Essay.)\n\n\nLocke\u2019s response is to turn the whole discussion away from real\nessences and back onto the nominal essences:\n\n\nYour lordship\u2019s proof here brought out of my Essay,\nconcerning the sun, I humbly conceive will not reach it; because what\nis said there, does not at all concern the real, but nominal essence;\nas is evident from hence, that the idea I speak of there, is a complex\nidea; but we have no complex idea of the internal constitution, or\nreal essence of the sun. Besides, I say expressly, that our\ndistinguishing substances into species by names, is not at all founded\non their real essences. So that the sun being one of these substances,\nI cannot, in the place quoted by your lordship, be supposed to mean by\nessence of the sun, the real essence of the sun, unless I had so\nexpressed it. But all this argument will be at an end, when your\nlordship shall have explained what you mean by these words,\n\u201ctrue sun.\u201d In my sense of them, any thing will be a true\nsun, to which the name sun may be truly and properly applied; and to\nthat substance or thing, the name sun may be truly and properly\napplied, which has united in it that combination of sensible\nqualities, by which any thing else that is called sun is distinguished\nfrom other substances, i.e. by the nominal essence\u2026. (Locke,\nWorks, vol. IV, pp. 83\u20134)\n\n\nAlthough this is controversial exegetical territory, it appears that\nLocke is aware of this \u2018real essence\u2019 version of natural\nkinds, but it further appears that he is unwilling to discuss it; his\nresponse was to steer clear of the metaphysical claim and return to\nthe semantic issue of nominal essences.\n\nAs natural as it is to interpret Locke as a natural kind realist,\nthere are problematic passages for that interpretation. With respect\nto the similarities among real essences, which was the main concern of\nLeibniz and Stillingfleet, in IV.vi.4 Locke argues that the assumption\nthat species are determined by real essences fails to tell us what\nwould count as a member of any species. That is, because we have no\nknowledge of real essences, no general claims about species would be\njustified and no individual would obviously belong to a particular\nspecies. So the assumption that Leibniz and Stillingfleet propose\nappears to be theoretically unmotivated. Moreover, as Locke\u2019s\nargument in III.vi.39 suggests, similarities in structure of the real\nessences, even if known, would still require us to decide which\nsimilarities (not to mention what degrees of similarity) would amount\nto similar enough to belong together in the same class:\n\n\nFor what is sufficient in the inward Contrivance, to make a new\nSpecies? There are some Watches, that are made with\nfour Wheels, others with five: Is this a specifick difference to the\nWorkman? Some have Strings and Physies, and others none; some have the\nBalance loose, and others regulated by a spiral Spring, and others by\nHogs Bristles: Are any, or all of these enough to make a specifick\ndifference to the Workman, that knows each of these, and several other\ndifferent contrivances, in the internal Constitutions of\nWatches? \u2018Tis certain, each of these hath a real\ndifference from the rest: But whether it be an essential, a specifick\ndifference or no, relates only to the complex Idea, to which\nthe name Watch is given: as long as they all agree in the\nIdea which that name stands for, and that name does not as a\ngenerical name comprehend different Species under it, they\nare not essentially nor specifically different. (III.vi.39; see also\nIII.vi.30)\n\n\nOf course, this view has been challenged recently. Allison Kuklok\n(2018) argues that this watch passage does not show that Locke took\nour sorting practices (at either the phenomenal or microphysical\nlevel) to be arbitrary. For her, a mistake that interpreters of Locke\nmake is to claim that the watch passage asserts that there is no fact\nof the matter about how things should be classified, and therefore,\nour classifications are arbitrary. According to Kuklok, this watch\nanalogy is intended to show the irrelevance of hidden internal\ndifferences to species whose boundaries are antecedently drawn at the\nphenomenal level by our natural sorting practices. By her lights, once\nwe acknowledge that passages like the watch analogy do not concern\nclassification, we see that Locke never argued that classification is\narbitrary.\n\nOn her reading, Locke thinks that species are made by the vulgar prior\nto our theorizing about internal constitutions, and these species\ncannot plausibly be understood as the result of arbitrary choice.\nAccording to Kuklok, the naturalness of our classifications stems from\nthe fact that Locke holds that humans have a natural disposition\ntoward species realism, and the fact that nature presents us with\nclusters of \u2018leading qualities\u2019 that appear as patterns or\nstandards. A relevant passage from Locke comes from II.xxxii.14: \u201cGod\nin His wisdom\u2026set [simple ideas] as Marks of Distinction in Things,\nwhereby we may be able to discern one Thing from\nanother\u201d. Given the vulgar realism and the leading patterns in\nnature, the vulgar classify based on non-arbitrary natural\nsimilarities. It is implausible \u201cto say that the similarities and\ndifferences between things leave it undetermined how we are to group\nand distinguish them\u201d (2022, p. 318). \n\nHowever, those who interpret the watch passage as implying\narbitrariness in classification (see Uzgalis (1988) and Jones (2010))\nwould have at least two replies. First, that \u2018arbitrary\u2019\ndoes not mean \u2018random\u2019 or that all qualities are equally\nadequate as differentia. The vulgar have good empirical\nreasons for their taxonomies, however, there are lots of similarly\ngood and natural reasons for different taxonomies. That does not imply\nthat every taxonomy is equally as acceptable. Moreover, given the\nbackground of corpuscularians who appeal to corpuscular forms as a\nground for natural kind realism, and given that Locke\u2019s focus is\nthe internal structure and arrangement of objects, it is plausible to\nsee the watch passage as insisting that real essences are not an\nadequate foundation for a theory of natural kinds.\n\nAs we can see, whether, in fact, Locke employed real essences as the\nfoundations of natural kinds is currently one of the hottest debates\namong Locke scholars, and there have been a number of good studies\nwritten in recent years.\n",
