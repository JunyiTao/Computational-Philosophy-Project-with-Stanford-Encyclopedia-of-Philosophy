    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nDiagrams or pictures probably rank among the oldest forms of human\ncommunication. They are not only used for representation but can also\nbe used to carry out certain types of reasoning, and hence play a\nparticular role in logic and mathematics. However, sentential\nrepresentation systems (e.g., first-order logic) have been dominant in\nthe modern history of logic, while diagrams have largely been seen as\nonly of marginal interest. Diagrams are usually adopted as a heuristic\ntool in exploring a proof, but not as part of a\n proof.[2]\n It is a quite recent movement among philosophers, logicians,\ncognitive scientists and computer scientists to focus on different\ntypes of representation systems, and much research has been focussed\non diagrammatic representation systems in particular.\n\nChallenging a long-standing prejudice against diagrammatic\nrepresentation, those working on multi-modal reasoning have taken\ndifferent kinds of approaches which we may categorize into three\ndistinct groups. One branch of research can be found in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive science. Since the limits of linguistic forms are\nclear to those who have been working on mental representation and\nreasoning, some philosophers and cognitive scientists have embraced\nthis new direction of multi-modal reasoning with enthusiasm and have\nexplored human reasoning and mental representation involving\nnon-linguistic forms (Cummins\n 1996;\n Chandrasekaran et al.\n 1995).\n Another strand of work on diagrammatic reasoning shows that there is\nno intrinsic difference between symbolic and diagrammatic systems as\nfar as their logical status goes. Some logicians have presented case\nstudies to prove that diagrammatic systems can be sound and complete\nin the same sense as symbolic systems. This type of result directly\nrefuted a widely-held assumption that diagrams are inherently\nmisleading, and abolished theoretical objections to diagrams being\nused in proofs (Shin\n 1994;\n Hammer\n 1995a).\n A third direction in multi-modal reasoning has been taken by computer\nscientists, whose interest is much more practical than those of the\nother groups. Not so surprisingly, those working in many areas in\ncomputer science\u2014for example, knowledge representation, systems\ndesign, visual programming, GUI design, and so on\u2014found new and\nexciting opportunities in this new concept of \u2018heterogeneous\nsystem\u2019 and have implemented diagrammatic representations in\ntheir research areas.\n\nWe have the following goals for this entry. First of all, we would\nlike to acquaint the reader with the details of some specific\ndiagrammatic systems. At the same time, the entry will address\ntheoretical issues, by exploring the nature of diagrammatic\nrepresentation and reasoning in terms of expressive power and\ncorrectness. The case study of the second section will not only\nsatisfy our first goal but also provide us with solid material for the\nmore theoretical and general discussion in the third section. The\nfourth section presents another case study and considers it in light\nof the third section\u2019s general discussion. As mentioned above,\nthe topic of diagrams has attracted much attention with important\nresults from many different research areas. Hence, our fifth section\naims to introduce various approaches to diagrammatic reasoning taken\nin different areas.\n\nFor further discussion, we need to clarify two related but distinct\nuses of the word \u2018diagram\u2019: diagram as internal mental\nrepresentation and diagram as external representation. The following\nquotation from Chandrasekaran et al.\n (1995:\n p. xvii) succinctly sums up the distinction between internal versus\nexternal diagrammatic representations:\n\nExternal diagrammatic representations: These are\nconstructed by the agent in a medium in the external world (paper,\netc), but are meant as representations by the agent.\nInternal diagrams or images: These comprise the\n(controversial) internal representations that are posited to have some\npictorial properties.\n\n\nAs we will see below, logicians focus on external diagrammatic\nsystems, the imagery debate among philosophers of mind and cognitive\nscientists is mainly about internal diagrams, and research on the\ncognitive role of diagrams touches on both forms.\n",
