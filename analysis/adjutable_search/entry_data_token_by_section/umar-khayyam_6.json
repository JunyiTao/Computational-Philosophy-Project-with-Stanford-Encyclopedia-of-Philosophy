    "main_text": "The Philosophical Works and Thoughts of Umar Khayyam || Subjects, Predicates, and Attributes\n2.6 Subjects, Predicates, and Attributes\nIn a complex discussion, Khayyam presents his views on the relationship between the subject, predicate, and attributes using a mixture of original insight and Aristotelian precedent. Dividing the attributes (al-aw\u1e63\u0101f) into two categories, essential and accidental, he discusses both categories and their subdivisions, such as concomitant accidental attributes vs. detachable accidental attributes (and the latter, in turn, is divided into merely detachable in estimation vs. detachable in estimation and in existence) in details (On Existence, Jamsh\u012bd Nij\u0101d Awwal (ed.), 101\u20132).\nDeveloping the same line of argument in The Necessity of Contrariety (N\u0101j\u012b I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b (ed.) 2000, 164), Khayyam proposes the following characterization of an \u201cessential attribute\u201d:\n\n[An attribute (wa\u1e63f)] is essential if [1] it is not possible to conceive the subject (al-maw\u1e63\u016bf) [of the attribution] except by conceiving that as having the attribute in the first place, and it is required for it [2] to belong to the subject [of the attribution] with no [extra] cause, like animality [as an essential attribute] of human, and [3 it is required for it] to be prior to the subject [of the attribution] essentially (bi al-\u1e0f\u0101t), that is, it [i.e. the essential attribute] is the cause of the subject [of the attribution] and not its effect, like animal [as an essential attribute] of human and [also] rational [as an essential attribute of human] (The Necessity of Contrariety, N\u0101j\u012b I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b 2000, 164; emphasis is ours).\n\n(We have translated wa\u1e63f as attribute and maw\u1e63\u016bf as the subject of attribution.) Khayyam\u2019s explication includes three conditions for an essential attribute (in relation to the subject of attribution): (1) conceptual priority, (2) no causal dependence (or posteriority), and (3) causal priority. First, conceptual priority indicates that Khayyam understands \u201cessential attributes\u201d not merely as metaphysically essential properties; they should satisfy some epistemological condition as well. Second, \u201cno causal dependence\u201d distinguishes essential attributes from all other attributes that do not follow from the essence of something (and thus their attribution to the subject requires a cause distinct from the subject). This is a strong, and well-known, metaphysical condition in the Islamic Aristotelian tradition. Nonetheless, \u201cconcomitants\u201d may satisfy \u201cno causal dependence\u201d requirement as well, because their attribution to the subject does not require any extra cause. Third, causal priority is supposed to exclude concomitants. So, no concomitant, even though necessarily predicable of its subject, is an essential attribute in the sense under discussion.\nAccording to Aminrazavi\u2019s interpretation of the above quote, \u201cessential attributes are those which are not possible to conceive of without the preconception of these a priori (badaw\u012b) attributes, such as \u2018animality which is an essential attribute of man\u2019\u201d (Aminrazavi 2007, 183). The term badaw\u012b is not in the original Arabic text, in fact it can only be found in a Persian translation of The Necessity of Contrariety (N\u0101j\u012b I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b 2000, 171). Moreover, badaw\u012b can be translated in many ways and \u201ca priori\u201d is not its most straightforward translation, if a proper translation in the first place. Finally, the above observations suggest that Khayyam\u2019s notion of \u201cessential attributes\u201d only implies conceptual priority (not a prioricity) of the essential attribute(s) to its subject. Conceiving animal is prior to conceiving human; this does not imply that the attribute animal is a priori (in its Kantian sense). If one could find further pieces of evidence in Khayyam\u2019s philosophy, with regard to a priori concepts or innate ideas, in its Cartesian sense, one might attempt to bolster Aminrazavi\u2019s claim. At present, we are not aware of any such evidence or argument.\nKhayyam also divides (essential and accidental) attributes into considerational (i\u2018tib\u0101r\u012b) and existential (wuj\u016bd\u012b) (i\u2018tib\u0101r\u012b has also been translated in the literature of Islamic/Arabic philosophy as item of consideration, abstract, secondary, fictional, intentional, mental, and conceptual; see, for example, Online Dictionary of Arabic Philosophical Terms. In this context, these translations may have misleading connotations. Thus, we suggest considerational, and use it in contrast with existential). Khayyam attempts to provide different criteria for this distinction:\n\nAnd the existential [attribute] is like the attribute black [attributed to a] material object (jism), when [in fact] it is black. Thus, being black is an existential attribute, that is, it is an additional meaning to the essence [to which] black [is attributed], as [it is] existing in re (mawj\u016bdun f\u012b al-a\u2018y\u0101n). Thus, if being black is an existential attribute (wa\u1e63f), then black is [called] an existential description (\u1e63ifa). (On Existence, Jamsh\u012bd Nij\u0101d Awwal (ed.) 2000, 102)\n\nAccordingly, an existential attribute is something that exists in re as an additional attribute of its subject. This point, i.e. being additional to the subject as it exists in re, is crucial to Khayyam\u2019s formulation of existential attributes since considerational attributes are only additional to their subject in intellectu (or, more specifically, in the intellect or in the estimative faculty). Khayyam finds existential attributes easily understandable and then quickly moves to introduce considerational attributes:[7]\n\nIf the intellect intellects a meaning (ma\u2018n\u0101) and details that intelligible [meaning] in an intelligible manner and considers its status/conditions (al-a\u1e25w\u0101l), if that meaning happens/occurs to some simple, not multiple, [meaning] like all existing accidents in re (f\u012b al-a\u2018y\u0101n), and it [i.e., the simple meaning] happens to have some attributes, then [the intellect] knows that all those attributes belong to that [simple meaning] on the basis of consideration, not on the basis of the existence in re. (On Existence, Jamsh\u012bd Nij\u0101d Awwal (ed.) 2000, 103)\n\nA considerational attribute is an intelligible meaning whose subject of attribution is another intelligible meaning that is simple, not multiple, in re and has multiple attributes. These attributes of the simple meaning are considerational attributes. This is because simple things, with no multiplicity in re, are not hylomorphically composite, that is, they are not composed of matter and form. So, their attributes are not grounded on real multiplicity or composition. And according to the Peripatetic philosophical school, accidents (in the sense of the nine Aristotelian categories) are simple in re, with no matter or form. If black is an accident (quality), being a color is a considerational attribute of that. Likewise, if two is an accident (quantity), being half of four is a considerational attribute of that as well. Let us explain these two examples in more detail.\nConsiderational attributes, as well as existential ones, come in two varieties: essential and accidental. Khayyam illustrates both cases. An example of an essential considerational attribute is being a color as an attribute of black. Conceiving being a color is conceptually prior to conceiving black and is the cause of black, that is, being a color is essentially prior to black (or white). Furthermore, an existential attribute of a subject is additional to its essence. But black itself is an accident and, here Khayyam seems to assume that, no accident can be the subject (in the metaphysical sense) of another accident. Finally, being a color and black cannot be accidents of the same subject because if this were the case, then black could come apart from being a color, at least in estimation, but this is impossible. So, being a color is an essential considerational attribute of black (On Existence, Jamsh\u012bd Nij\u0101d Awwal (ed.) 2000, 103\u20134). An example of an accidental considerational attribute is being half of four as an attribute of two. Conceiving being half of four is not conceptually prior to conceiving two, nor is being half of four the cause of two. So, being half of four is not an essential attribute of two. Hence, being half of four is an accidental attribute of two. Furthermore, an existential attribute of a subject is additional to its essence. If being half of four were something additional (za\u2019id) to two (in re), then two would have infinite meanings added to its essence (in re). But this is impossible, according to Khayyam. Therefore, being half of four is not an accidental existential attribute of two. Therefore, being half of four is an accidental considerational attribute of two (On Existence, Jamsh\u012bd Nij\u0101d Awwal (ed.) 2000, 102\u20133). (This example suggests that two, as an accident, is a simple meaning, with no matter or form, even though it is true of two entities.)\nBy way of analogy, and in some respects, the problem of considerational vs. existential attributes, as Khayyam discusses, is like the problem of non-natural vs. natural properties in contemporary analytic philosophy. This semantic division plays a significant metaphysical role in Khayyam\u2019s metaphysics, to which we shall turn next.\n",
