    "main_text": "Morality and freedom || The fact of reason\n5.3 The fact of reason\n\nCan we know that we are free in this transcendental sense?\nKant\u2019s response is tricky. On the one hand, he distinguishes\nbetween theoretical knowledge and morally justified belief\n(A820\u2013831/B848\u2013859). We do not have theoretical knowledge\nthat we are free or about anything beyond the limits of possible\nexperience, but we are morally justified in believing that we are free\nin this sense. On the other hand, Kant also uses stronger language\nthan this when discussing freedom. For example, he says that\n\u201camong all the ideas of speculative reason freedom is the only\none the possibility of which we know a priori, though without having\nany insight into it, because it is the condition of the moral law,\nwhich we do know.\u201d In a footnote to this passage, Kant explains\nthat we know freedom a priori because \u201cwere there no freedom,\nthe moral law would not be encountered at all in ourselves,\u201d and\non Kant\u2019s view everyone does encounter the moral law a priori\n(5:4). For this reason, Kant claims that the moral law\n\u201cproves\u201d the objective, \u201cthough only practical,\nundoubted reality\u201d of freedom (5:48\u201349). So Kant wants to\nsay that we do have knowledge of the reality of freedom, but that this\nis practical knowledge of a practical reality, or cognition\n\u201conly for practical purposes,\u201d by which he means to\ndistinguish it from theoretical knowledge based on experience or\nreflection on the conditions of experience (5:133). Our practical\nknowledge of freedom is based instead on the moral law. The difference\nbetween Kant\u2019s stronger and weaker language seems mainly to be\nthat his stronger language emphasizes that our belief or practical\nknowledge about freedom is unshakeable and that it in turn provides\nsupport for other morally grounded beliefs in God and the immortality\nof the soul. \n\nKant calls our consciousness of the moral law, our awareness that the\nmoral law binds us or has authority over us, the \u201cfact of\nreason\u201d (5:31\u201332, 42\u201343, 47, 55). So, on his view,\nthe fact of reason is the practical basis for our belief or practical\nknowledge that we are free. Kant insists that this moral consciousness\nis \u201cundeniable,\u201d \u201ca priori,\u201d and\n\u201cunavoidable\u201d (5:32, 47, 55). Every human being has a\nconscience, a common sense grasp of morality, and a firm conviction\nthat he or she is morally accountable. We may have different beliefs\nabout the source of morality\u2019s authority \u2013 God, social\nconvention, human reason. We may arrive at different conclusions about\nwhat morality requires in specific situations. And we may violate our\nown sense of duty. But we all have a conscience, and an unshakeable\nbelief that morality applies to us. According to Kant, this belief\ncannot and does not need to be justified or \u201cproved by any\ndeduction\u201d (5:47). It is just a ground-level fact about human\nbeings that we hold ourselves morally accountable. But Kant is making\na normative claim here as well: it is also a fact, which cannot and\ndoes not need to be justified, that we are morally accountable, that\nmorality does have authority over us. Kant holds that philosophy\nshould be in the business of defending this common sense moral belief,\nand that in any case we could never prove or disprove it (4:459).\n\nKant may hold that the fact of reason, or our consciousness of moral\nobligation, implies that we are free on the grounds that ought implies\ncan. In other words, Kant may believe that it follows from the fact\nthat we ought (morally) to do something that we can or are able to do\nit. This is suggested, for example, by a passage in which Kant asks us\nto imagine someone threatened by his prince with immediate execution\nunless he \u201cgive[s] false testimony against an honorable man whom\nthe prince would like to destroy under a plausible pretext.\u201d\nKant says that \u201c[h]e would perhaps not venture to assert whether\nhe would do it or not, but he must admit without hesitation that it\nwould be possible for him. He judges, therefore, that he can do\nsomething because he is aware that he ought to do it and cognizes\nfreedom within him, which, without the moral law, would have remained\nunknown to him\u201d (5:30). This is a hypothetical example of an\naction not yet carried out. It seems that pangs of guilt about the\nimmorality of an action that you carried out in the past, on this\nreasoning, would imply more directly that you have (or at least had)\nthe ability to act otherwise than you did, and therefore that you are\nfree in Kant\u2019s sense.\n",
