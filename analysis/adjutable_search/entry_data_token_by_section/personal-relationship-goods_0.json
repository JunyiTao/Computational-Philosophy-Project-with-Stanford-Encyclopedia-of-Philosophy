    "main_text": "Preliminary Distinctions\n1. Preliminary Distinctions\n\nHere, \u201crelationship goods\u201d refers to those goods of\nconstitutive (as well as, often, instrumental) value that accrue to\nindividuals in virtue of them being in relationships with other\npeople, and that could not be enjoyed outside relationships. Examples\ninclude companionship, affection, intimacy, attachment, love,\nfriendship, empathy, social respect, solidarity, trust. The\ndistinction between relationships and some of the relationship goods\nidentified here may be purely analytical: Relationships partly consist\nof these goods, as they would not exists\u2014or would not be the\nkind of relationships they are\u2014in the absence of these\n\u201cgoods\u201d. To some extent, our language bears witness to\nthis: we use \u201clove\u201d or \u201cfriendship\u201d both in\norder to refer to types of relationships and to refer to the things\nthat individuals \u201cget\u201d out of relationships. Therefore,\ntalking about relationship goods\u2014as well as about distributing\nthem\u2014is artificial, yet helpful for the purpose of the present\nnormative analysis.\n\nOne sub-category of relationship goods that has received philosophical\nattention recently are familial relationship goods: these are\nrelationship goods that accrue to individuals in virtue of them being\nin an adequate parent-child relationship (Macleod 2002; Brighouse\n& Swift 2014). They include things such as providing authoritative\ncare for a child, the special spontaneous love and intimacy that (it\nhas been argued) is only possible between a child and a parental\nfigure, and a sense of continuity with the past and the future that is\ncreated by being part of a family. Another example of relationship\ngoods are political relationship goods: These are relationship goods\nthat accrue to individuals in virtue of them being in political\nrelationships with each other (personal or not)\u2014for instance\nwith co-citizens or co-nationals, fellow members of the same political\norganization such as a party or a trade union. Examples include voting\nrights, social respect, social trust, social solidarity, as well as\nthose goods that are the focus of relational egalitarianism\u2014a\nstrand of egalitarianism interested in how we relate to each others as\nequals\u2014such as respect, recognition, inclusion, and community\n(Honneth 1992; Wolff 1998; Anderson 1999; Young 1990; Gheaus\n2018).\n\nThe subject of this entry is a large sub-class of relationship goods,\n\u201cpersonal relationship goods\u201d; they accrue to individuals\nin virtue of them being in relationships that involve some kind of\ndirect, personalized interaction\u2014for instance with friends,\nfamily members, neighbors, colleagues, people who are active in the\nsame political or social movement, or even strangers with whom one\ngets into direct contact that is substantial enough to be personal.\nRelationships that don\u2019t qualify for this description are often\nanonymous interactions, like one-off interactions with a clerk or a\nmall employee often are. People involved in some personal\nrelationships may also stand in a political relationship, and then the\ngoods realized in the relationships are also political. Examples are\nthe personalized trust, solidarity or loyalty that can bind\nindividuals who relate directly to each other as part of a political\nmovement. Other such goods are personal relationship goods realized in\nnon-political relationships. Examples are companionship, affection,\nattention, sympathy, encouragement, acceptance or loyalty and trust\nthat one gives and receives qua part of a personal\nrelationship.\n\nExamples of relationship goods that are not personal\nrelationship goods are social solidarity\u2014expressed through the\nexistence of a social security net\u2014social\ninclusion\u2014expressed, for instance, in anti-discrimination\nlaws\u2014or voting rights. One can enjoy these goods even in the\nabsence of direct, personal encounters with other individuals.\n\nBecause the scope of this entry includes goods that are realized in\nrelationships that are personal but not close, or intimate, this\ndefinition of relationship goods is wider than that implicit in Chiara\nCordelli\u2019s notion of relational resources. These are resources\nmade available through\n\n\nintimate relationships such as relationships of familial love,\nfriendship, and kinship, as well as non-intimate relationships between\ncolleagues, neighbors, members of voluntary associations, and\nparticipants in a common social network\n\n\nbut not through\n\n\nthe more abstract relation of political citizenship. (Cordelli 2015a:\n90)\n\n\nAt the same time, it is a narrower understanding of relational goods\nthan other notions discussed in recent literature (Seglow 2013), which\ninclude relationship goods that do not flow from personal, but from\nmore anonymous, relationships such as those between co-citizens.\n\n\u201cPersonal relationship goods in general\u201d are personal\nrelationship goods that are accessible to, valuable for, and possibly\nowed to people of any age. For the purpose of this entry,\n\u201cpersonal relationship goods for children\u201d are personal\nrelationship goods that have only been said to be owed to\nchildren.\n\nThe main philosophical issue raised by personal relationship goods is\nthe following: They are highly valuable for all individuals (in ways\nexplained below) both non-instrumentally and instrumentally. And they\nare especially important for children, because they are essential for\ntheir survival, for flourishing qua children and for\ndevelopmental reasons. For these reasons, it is clear that personal\nrelationships generate weighty reasons for action. The main\ntask of practical philosophers is then to see how weighty these\nreasons are, and, in particular, whether personal relationship goods\nalso generate moral duties: Are there any duties to ensure people\nenjoy (opportunities to) them? And if so, are some of these duties\nduties of justice? Are they enforceable as in a) feasible to enforce\nand b) legitimate to enforce? And what kind of measures can states\ntake to ensure a fairer distribution of these goods?\n",
