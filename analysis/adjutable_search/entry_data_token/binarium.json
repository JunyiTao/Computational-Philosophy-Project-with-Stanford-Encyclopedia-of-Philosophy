The \u201cmost famous pair\u201d\n\n\nSome historians of medieval philosophy describe what they see as an\nAugustinian \u201cdoctrinal complex\u201d that emerged in the late twelfth and\nearly thirteenth centuries and that was the \u201ccommon teaching\u201d among\nscholastics after the \n 1220s.[1]\n Weisheipl [1980], pp. 242\u201343, lists five ingredients of this\n\u201cAugustinian\u201d \n synthesis:[2]\n\nvoluntarism (an emphasis on the role of the will as distinct from\nthe intellect)\nuniversal hylomorphism\nplurality of forms\ndivine illumination, interpreted through the influence of\nAvicenna\nthe real identity of the soul with its powers or faculties.\n\n\n\nThe second and third items on this list together make up what is\nsometimes called the \u201cbinarium famosissimum,\u201d the \u201cmost famous\npair.\u201d\n1.1 Universal hylomorphism\n\n\nPaul Woodruff has defined hylomorphism as \u201cthe doctrine, first\ntaught by Aristotle, that concrete substance consists of forms in\nmatter (hyle)\u201d (Audi [1999], p. 408). One might therefore\nexpect universal hylomorphism to be the doctrine that\nall substances consist of forms in matter. But in fact the\nmedieval theory of universal hylomorphism maintained something slightly\nweaker than that; it held that all substances except God were\ncomposed of matter and form, whereas God is entirely immaterial.\n\n\nThis view seems to be the result of two more basic theses:\n\nthe explicit claim that only God is metaphysically simple in all\nrespects, so that all creatures are metaphysically composite;\nthe view, not always explicitly spelled\nout, that all composition is in some way a composition of matter and\nform, an indeterminate factor and a determining element.\n\n\n\nThe reasoning behind the second thesis is murky. On the other hand,\nit is easy to find medieval authors who argue in detail for the\nfirst\n claim.[3]\n Still, it is surprisingly hard to find any medieval author who gives\na good motivation for it. That is, why should it be\nimportant to maintain that God and only God is metaphysically\nsimple? What rests on the claim?\n\n\nIt it tempting, and plausible, to suppose that the implicit\nreasoning goes something like this: \u201cComposite\u201d (com +\npositus = \u201cput together\u201d) things don't just happen to\nbe composite; something put them together. In short, composition\nrequires an efficient cause. It follows therefore that God, as first\ncause, cannot be composite. Conversely, anything that is caused is in\nsome sense composite. Hence, since everything besides God is created\nand therefore caused, everything other than God is composite. In short,\nthe unique simplicity of God is important to maintain because it is\nrequired by the doctrine of creation. Nevertheless, while this line of\nreasoning is plausible, it is not found clearly stated in any medieval\nauthor I know\n of.[4]\n\n\nThe notion that all creatures are composites of matter and form\nrequires that something be said about what we might otherwise call\n\u201cimmaterial\u201d substances\u2014angels, Aristotelian \u201cseparated\nsubstances,\u201d the human soul after death. For universal hylomorphism,\nsuch entities cannot be truly immaterial, and yet they are obviously\nquite unlike familiar physical objects. As a result, universal\nhylomorphists distinguished between \u201ccorporeal\u201d matter, i.e., the\nmatter of physical, sensible objects, and another kind of matter\nsometimes called\n \u201cspiritual matter.\u201d[5]\n1.2 Plurality of forms\n\n\nThe theory known as \u201cplurality of forms\u201d is not just the theory that\nthere are typically many forms in a material substance. That would\nhave been an innocuous claim; everyone agreed that material substances\nroutinely have many accidental forms. The theory of plurality\nof forms is instead the theory that there is a plurality of\nsubstantial forms in a given material substance. Details of\nthe theory varied widely from author to\n author.[6]\n There was some disagreement over how many substantial forms were\ninvolved. Most people who held a version of this theory agreed that at\nleast a \u201cform of corporeity\u201d was required in all physical substances,\nbut they disagreed over how many additional substantial forms were\nrequired for a given kind of body. Particular attention was given to\nthe case of the human body.\n\n\nThe arguments in support of this theory were quite diverse, and come\nfrom a variety of directions. William of Ockham, for instance, held\nthat if the form of corporeity were not distinct from the intellective\nsoul and were not essentially present in the human being both during\nhis life and after the intellective soul departs at death, then once a\nsaint had died it would be false to say that the body that remains is\nthe body that saint ever had. Hence the cult of venerating the bodies\nof the saints would make no sense. (Quodlibet II, q.\n 11.[7])\n\n\nAgain, Thomas Aquinas, although he rejects plurality or forms,\nnevertheless records several arguments given on its behalf. Among\n them[8]\n\n\n\nFurthermore, before the coming of the rational soul the body in the\nwomb of the mother has some form. Now when the rational soul comes, it\ncannot be said that this form disappears, because it does not lapse\ninto nothingness, nor would it be possible to specify anything into\nwhich it might return. Therefore, some form exists in the matter\nprevious to the rational soul \u2026\n\n\nFurthermore, in VII Metaphysica [11, 1036a 26] it is said\nthat every definition has parts, and that the parts of a definition are\nforms. In anything that is defined, therefore, there must be several\nforms. Since, therefore, man is a kind of defined thing, it is\nnecessary to posit in him several forms; and so some form exists before\nthe rational soul.\n\n2. Proponents and opponents\n\n\nThe theories of universal hylomorphism and plurality of forms are\nfound together in many authors from the twelfth and thirteenth\ncentury.  They are both held, for instance, by the author known to the\nscholastics as \u201cAvicebron\u201d (or Avicebrol, Avencebrol, etc.), who is to\nbe identified with the Spanish Jewish philosopher and poet Solomon Ibn\nGabirol (c. 1022\u2013c. 1052/c. 1070), and whose Mekor Hayyim\n(=\u00a0Fons vitae, \u201cFountain of Life\u201d) was translated into Latin\nin the late-twelfth\n century.[9]\n Indeed, medieval as well as modern scholars have sometimes looked to\nIbn Gabirol as the main source for the two doctrines in the thirteenth\n century.[10]\n Other authors who held both theories included the translator of the\nFons vitae, one Dominic Gundisalvi \n (Gundissalinus)[11]\n as well as people as diverse as Thomas of \n York,[12]\n St. \n Bonaventure,[13]\n the anonymous thirteenth-century Summa philosophiae once\nascribed to Robert\n Grosseteste,[14]\n John Pecham, Richard of\n Mediavilla,[15]\n and many\n others.[16]\n\n\nBut other authors rejected these two views. The best known is no\ndoubt Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas held that the\nuniqueness of God's absolute simplicity does not require positing a\nkind of matter in all creatures. Rather all creatures, including\nincorporeal substances such as angels or human souls, are composite\ninsofar as they have a composition of essence and esse (\u201cto\nbe,\u201d the act of existing), whether or not they have an additional\ncomposition or matter and\n form.[17]\n Again, he argues that if any substance has a plurality of forms, only\nthe first form that comes to it can be a substantial form;\nall the others must be accidental\n forms.[18]\n Godfrey of Fontaines likewise rejected both theories. John Duns\nScotus accepted plurality of forms, but denied universal\n hylomorphism.[19]\n3. The expression \u201cbinarium famosissimum\u201d\n\n\nThe expression \u201cbinarium famosissimum\u201d is not a medieval label\nfor this pairing of doctrines; its use in this sense appears to be\npurely a twentieth-century development. Oddly enough, only a single\noccurrence of the expression has been found in a medieval text,\nthe anonymous Summa philosophiae cited\n above.[20]\n But it clear that this author uses the expression to refer not to a\npair of doctrines, whether to universal hylomorphism and plurality of\nforms or to any other pair, but to the division of substance into\ncorporeal and\n incorporeal[21]:\n\n Now the first contrariety in the categorial line of substance, from\nthe nature of genus, partly by reason of the matter related to both\nsides [i.e., to corporeal and incorporeal], partly from the nature of\nthe most common form tending to particularity by degrees according to\nthe proportion of the matter's receptivity, contains the binarium\nfamosissimum, that is, corporeal and incorporeal.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, as early as 1943 Daniel Callus writes of a\ncertain John Blund, an early-thirteenth century Englishman who rejected\nboth universal hylomorphism and plurality of forms. Callus says [1943], p. 252:\n\n More than Gundissalinus, we see delineated in Blund the great\nquestions which in the second half of that century were to divide the\ndifferent schools into two opposing armies, the outlining of the\nconflict between philosophers and theologians, Aristotelians and the\nso-called Augustinians. In Blund we meet with the earliest, clear, and\nunmistakable account of the binarium famosissimum of the\nAugustinians, Plurality of Forms and hylomorphic composition of\nspiritual substances, the angels and the human soul.\n \n\n\nAgain, in a paper delivered in 1946, Callus [1955], p. 4, mentions\nthe \u201cbinarium famosissimum, the twofold pillar on which the\nwhole structure of the Augustinian school was supposed to stand.\u201d\nAlthough he does not there say what this \u201ctwofold pillar\u201d is, a few\npages later (p. 9) he cites \u201cthe famosissimum binarium\nAugustinianum, namely, the hylomorphic composition of all created\nbeings, not only corporeal but also spiritual substances, the angels\nand the human soul; and plurality of forms in one and the same\nindividual.\u201d\n\n\nA few years later \u00c9tienne Gilson [1955], p. 377, in the\ndiscussion of Thomas Aquinas in his monumental History of Christian\nPhilosophy in the Middle Ages, says:\n\n\n The radical elimination of the binarium famosissimum, i.e.,\nhylomorphism and the plurality of forms, was not due to a more correct\nunderstanding of the metaphysics of Aristotle but to the introduction,\nby Thomas Aquinas, of a new metaphysical notion of being.\n\n\n\nAgain, Weisheipl [1980], p. 250, writing about Albert the Great,\nsays (the emphasis is Weisheipl's):\n\nThus Albert is quick to point out that Avicebron in the Fons\nvitae is \u201cthe only [philosopher] who says that from one simple\nprinciple two [things] must immediately proceed in the order of\nnature, since the number \u2018two\u2019 follows upon unity.\u201d And\nSaint Thomas notes: \u201cSome say that the soul and absolutely every\nsubstance besides God is composed of matter and form; indeed the\nfirst author to hold this position is Avicebron, the author\nof Liber fons vitae.\u201d This is the origin of the later\nbinarium famosissimum: after One must come Two.\n \n\n\nIn this passage, Weisheipl uses the phrase \u201cbinarium\nfamosissimum\u201d in a sense perhaps loosely related to that used by\nthe author of the Summa philosophiae. But he also links it,\nvia the quotation from Aquinas, to the doctrine of universal\n hylomorphism.[22]\n\n\nA few years later, Weisheipl ([1984], p. 451), speaking about Robert Grosseteste, remarks that he:\n\nsaw no problem whatever in accepting universal hylomorphism or a plurality of forms in a single material composite. Not only were these two tenets, known as the binarium famosissimum, common in the 1220s and 1230s, they were accepted as 'traditional' teaching by Franciscans at Oxford and Paris throughout the thirteenth century. John Peckham, Matthew of Aquasparta, Richard of Mediavilla, Roger Bacon, the pseudo-Grosseteste and even John Duns Scotus took the binarium famosissimum as orthodox Augustinian doctrine against the 'novelties' of Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas.[23]\n\n\n\nAgain, E. A. Synan [1993], p. 236, refers to Aquinas's denial that\nthere can be a plurality of substantial forms in any given substance,\nand calls it a \u201crejection of one half of the binarium\nfamosissimum.\u201d\n4. Conceptual issues\n\n\nThus, although Gilson and some other twentieth-century scholars have\npaired the theories of universal hylomorphism and plurality of forms\nunder the title \u201cbinarium famosissimum,\u201d and although it is\ncertainly true that many medieval authors held both theories, there is\nno evidence that in medieval times they were ever thought of as a\n\u201cpair\u201d in this way.\n\n\nWhy then have some recent scholars linked the two theories so\nclosely? They certainly have done so. Weisheipl ([1980], p. 243), for\nexample, describes the plurality of forms as \u201csimply a logical\nconsequence of\u201d universal hylomorphism. And Zavalloni ([1951], p. 437,\nn. 61) likewise claims that universal hylomorphism necessarily implies\nplurality of forms, although he says the latter does not imply the\n former.[24]\n\n\nWhat may be going on is this. The theory of universal hylomorphism\nclosely fits the view that the structure of what we truly say about\nthings mirrors the structure of the things themselves. Thus, if I truly\nsay \u2018The cat is black\u2019, then there is a cat that corresponds to the\nsubject term, and that cat is qualified by the quality blackness corresponding to the predicate term.\nWithout the blackness, the cat is to that extent indeterminate. It is\nthe addition of blackness that determines the cat to the particular\ncolor it has. In general then, the relation of subject to predicate in\na true affirmative judgment is the relation of what is at least\nrelatively indeterminate to what at least partially determines it. Now\nthe relation of something indeterminate to what determines it is a\nrelation of \u201cmatter\u201d to \n \u201cform.\u201d[25]\n Hence everything we can truly say about a subject reflects the fact\nthat the thing is composed of an indeterminate side and a determining\nelement\u2014of matter and form.  In short, hylomorphic composition\nis involved in anything we can make true affirmations\nabout\u2014thus, universal\n hylomorphism.[26]\n\n\nOf course, we can truly say many things about a given subject.  (E.g.,\n\u2018The cat is black\u2019, \u2018The cat is fat\u2019,\n\u2018The cat is asleep\u2019, etc.)  The predicates of all these\ntrue statements correspond to forms really inhering in the relatively\nindeterminate subject. Hence we can speak of a \u201cplurality of forms.\u201d\nBut the \u201cplurality of forms,\u201d in the sense in which our authors speak\nof it, refers to something more restricted, to the fact that we can\npredicate predicates of a given subject in a certain \u201cnested\u201d\norder. We can, for example, while taking about the very same cat,\nsay \u201cThis is a body\u201d (i.e., it is corporeal), \u201cThis body is alive\u201d\n(i.e., it is an organism), \u201cThis organism is sensate\u201d (i.e., it has\nsensation, it is an animal), \u201cThis animal is a cat,\u201d \u201cThis cat is\nblack,\u201d etc. Each such predication attributes a form to the\nunderlying, \u201cmaterial,\u201d indeterminate subject, and each such subject\nis in turn a composite of a form and a deeper, underlying\nmaterial subject. The picture we get then is the picture of some kind\nof primordial matter, corresponding to the bare \u2018this'\nof the first predication (\u201cThis is a body\u201d), to which is added a\nseries of forms one on top of the other in a certain order,\neach one limiting and narrowing down the preceding ones. The structure\nthat results is a kind of laminated structure, a metaphysical \u201conion\u201d\nwith several layers. On this picture, of course, substantial and\naccidental forms are both \u201clayers of the onion\u201d in exactly the same\nsense. The distinction between essential and accidental features of a\nthing would therefore have to be drawn in some other way.\n\n\nIf this reconstruction is more or less correct, then it is clear why\nuniversal hylomorphism and plurality of forms can be viewed as\nconceptually linked. Both fit nicely with the view that the structure\nof reality is accurately mirrored in true predication. Ibn Gabirol,\nwho held both theories, seems to have been thinking along\napproximately these lines. But some of the arguments cited above in\nfavor of plurality of forms show that at least that half of the \u201cpair\u201d\nwas sometimes held for entirely different reasons.\n\n\nBy contrast with the above reasoning, there is another view of\npredication, an \u201cAristotelian\u201d (and later, Thomistic) view that\nrejects this picture. On this view, true predication in language is\nnot a reliable guide to the metaphysical structure of what makes it\ntrue. One can truly describe a given subject in narrower and\nnarrower terms without there being any corresponding distinction of\nreal metaphysical components in what we are describing. We can, for\nexample, describe our cat as a body, as an organism, as an animal, and\nas in particular a cat, all the while referring to a single\nmetaphysical configuration, a particular combination (in this case) of\nmatter and a feline form. Calling it a body, an organism, an animal,\nbefore calling it a cat in no way reflects any sequence of\nmetaphysical distinctions in the entity itself. It is only when we\ncall it \u201cblack\u201d that we introduce a new entity into the structure, an\naccident. In short, on this alternative view, the structure\nof reality is not accurately mirrored in true predication, at\nleast not in any straightforward way. This view is not committed to\nany \u201cplurality\u201d of substantial forms, and is not committed to\nuniversal hylomorphism\n either.[27]\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nThe issues here are complex and the historical facts are not yet\nwell sorted out. But it appears that twentieth-century scholars who saw\na close conceptual link between universal hylomorphism and the\nplurality of forms were perhaps thinking of the two theories as\nmotivated by a common commitment to the first theory of predication\ndescribed in \u00a7 4 above. In some cases (for example the Fons vitae),\nthey probably were so motivated. Still, the fact that the two theories\nare regarded as a \u201cpair\u201d is a recent phenomenon, not a medieval\none. It seems to have arisen first in the writings of Daniel Callus.[28]\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aquinas, Thomas. 1949. <em>On Spiritual Creatures (De Spiritualibus\nCreaturis).</em> Mary C.
