    "main_text": "Origins of Evil: Moral and Natural || Moral Evil\n4.1 Moral Evil\n\nMoral evil is metaphysical or empirical evil that arises out\nof the acts or intentions of agents: other traditional terms for it\ninclude \u201csin\u201d, \u201cwickedness\u201d,\n\u201ctrespass\u201d, and \u201ciniquity\u201d.\n\nPhilosophers in the Abrahamic tradition typically hold that we can be\ndamaged by moral evil even before we have performed any\nactions whatsoever. Augustine, for example, characterizes Original Sin\nas a result of a primordial choice that damaged our very\nnature such that each member of the species is born already worthy of\ninfinite punishment and strongly inclined to engage in further moral\nevil. So this is a case of metaphysical evil that has its origin in\nmoral evil: bad choices on the part of the forefather led to damaged\nnatures all the way down the spermatic line.\n\nSuch metaphysical evil will often manifest in empirical evil (although\nit need not do so); it also makes it likely that there will be further\nmetaphysical evil. Thus an initial moral choice starts off a kind of\nsnowballing into hellishness. It is clear why ancient and medieval and\neven some contemporary responses to the \u201cUnde\nMalum?\u201d question focus on how a morally uncorrupted\ncreature (Adam, Eve, or Lucifer) could have started the process in the\nfirst place (see, e.g., Anselm De Casu Diaboli, vol.1 and\nJohnston forthcoming).\n\nKant appropriates this idea in a modern context, arguing that we are\nall originally afflicted by a propensity to moral evil\n(Hang zum B\u00f6sen), even apart from any specific actions\nthat we perform. This \u201cradical evil\u201d\u2014the\nmetaphysical evil at the root of our nature\n(\u201cradix\u201d = Latin for \u201croot\u201d)\u2014is\nsomething for which not Adam but we as individual agents (or\nperhaps the species itself) are somehow responsible. And this\nis reflected even in garden-variety peccadillos: any act that\nsubordinates commitment to the moral law to something else is an\nexpression of radical evil. This makes it clear that people who use\n\u201cradical evil\u201d to refer to something particularly\nhorrendous or awful (Arendt 1951, Bernstein 2002) are departing from\nthe Kantian concept (see\n Section 7\n below). That said, whether it is intelligible to say that we are\nculpable for a status that is not temporal is a notoriously\nopen question in Kant-interpretation (see Card 2010, Wood 2010, and\nother essays in Anderson-Gold & Muchnik 2010).\n\nAlthough moral evildoing often leads to empirical evil, it\nneedn\u2019t do so, at least on non-utilitarian accounts. Some crimes\ncan be \u201cvictimless\u201d at the empirical level.\n\nOnce again, the four traditional theoretical templates can be used to\nfurther characterize the evil acts and intentions that make an evil\n\u201cmoral\u201d.  Absence Theory says that the\nabsence of a good will\u2014either because something lacks a\nwill altogether, or because its will is not good\u2014is evil just by\nway of being an absence. Privation Theory says that a will is\nevil when it ought not have the absence of good orientation\nthat it does. Matter Theory says that our embodiment and\nother engagements with matter explain the misorientation of our will.\nReal Property Theory insists that a will that is oriented to\nthe bad is a real thing, and that its orientation to the bad\nis a real feature of it, not just a privation.\n\nDeclaring that moral evil is rooted in the will does not fully\nexplain it. We would need a further account of how\nevil choices are made\u2014of what sort of moral psychology could\nexplain them. For Kant, explanation ceases at some point; evil\nchoices, at bottom, are irrational\u2014surds that we can identify\nand impute, but never fully explain. \u201cThere is no conceivable\nground for us, therefore, from which moral evil could first have come\nin us\u201d (Kant 1793 [AK 6:43; 1998: 64]).\n\nOther philosophers offer partial explanations. Augustine says that\nalthough there is no determining cause of the devil\u2019s\nchoice, it is able to be partly \u201crationalized\u201d in terms of\nSatan\u2019s self-obsessed delight in his own powers (see King 2019).\nThis is an early version of what is now called a\n\u201cdispositional\u201d account of evil agency (L. Russell 2014:\nch.10; Kamtekar 2019). Early Islamic interpreters of the Qu\u2019ran,\nby contrast, offer explanations in terms of ignorance: there is\nsomething that the supremely evil agent (Iblis) didn\u2019t realize,\nor an inference that he failed to make, and this is what explains his\norientation to the bad (see Germann 2019).\n\nMoral evil is what contemporary people\u2014including\nphilosophers\u2014tend to have in mind when they talk of\n\u201cevil\u201d. Extreme forms of it are viewed by many\nphilosophers view as \u201cunintelligible\u201d\u2014as defying\nordinary explanation in significant and threatening ways. Such extreme\nand unintelligible moral evils are what many philosophers (though not\nKant) are referring to when they speak of \u201cradical\u201d evil\n(Arendt 1951; L. Russell 2014; see also\n Section 7).\n",
