    "main_text": "The Ethics of the Revival of the Religious Sciences\n5. The Ethics of the Revival of the Religious Sciences\n\nSoon after al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee had published his two refutations of\nfalsafa and Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelism he left his position\nat the Niz\u00e2miyya madrasa in Baghdad. During this period he began\nwriting what most Muslim scholars regard as his major work, The\nRevival of the Religious Sciences (Ihy\u00e2\u2019\n\u2018ul\u00fbm al-d\u00een). The voluminous Revival\nis a comprehensive guide to ethical behavior in the everyday life of\nMuslims (Garden 2014: 63\u2013122). It is divided into four sections, each\ncontaining ten books. The first section deals with ritual practices\n(\u2018ib\u00e2d\u00e2t), the second with social customs\n(\u2018\u00e2d\u00e2t), the third with those things that\nlead to perdition (muhlik\u00e2t) and hence should be\navoided, and the fourth with those that lead to salvation\n(munjiy\u00e2t) and should be sought. In the forty books of\nthe Revival al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee severely criticizes the\ncoveting of worldly matters and reminds his readers that human life is\na path towards Judgment Day and the reward or punishment gained\nthrough it. Compared with the eternity of the next life, this life is\nalmost insignificant, yet it seals our fate in the world to come. In\nhis autobiography al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee writes that reading Sufi\nliterature made him realize that our theological convictions are by\nthemselves irrelevant for gaining redemption in the afterlife. Not our\ngood beliefs or intentions count; only our good and virtuous actions\nwill determine our life in the world to come. This insight prompted\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee to change his lifestyle and adopt the Sufi path\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1959a, 35\u201338 = 2000b, 77\u201380). In\nthe Revival he composed a book about human actions\n(mu\u2019\u00e2mal\u00e2t) that wishes to steer clear of\nany deeper discussion of theological insights\n(muk\u00e2shaf\u00e2t). Rather, it aims at guiding people\ntowards ethical behavior that God will reward in this world and the\nnext (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 1:4\u20135).\n\nIn the Revival al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee attacks his colleagues\nin Muslim scholarship, questioning their intellectual capacities and\nindependence as well as their commitment to gaining reward in the\nworld to come. This increased moral consciousness brings\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee close to Sufi attitudes, which have a profound\ninfluence on his subsequent works such as The Niche of Lights\n(Mishk\u00e2t al-anw\u00e2r). These later works also reveal\na significant philosophical influence on al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee. In\nthe Revival he teaches ethics that are based on the\ndevelopment of character traits (singl., khulq, pl.\nakhl\u00e2q). Performing praiseworthy deeds is an effect of\npraiseworthy character traits that warrant salvation in the next life\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 1:34.4\u20135). He criticizes\nthe more traditional concept of Sunni ethics that is limited to\ncompliance with the ordinances of the religious law\n(shar\u00ee\u2019a) and following the example of the\nProphet Muhammad. Traditional Sunni ethics are closely linked to\njurisprudence (fiqh) and limit itself, according to\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee, to determining and teaching the rules of\nshar\u00ee\u2019a. Traditional Sunni jurisprudents are mere\n\u201cscholars of this world\u201d (\u2018ulam\u00e2\u2019\nal-duny\u00e2) who cannot guide Muslims on the best way to gain\nthe afterlife (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 1:30\u201338,\n98\u2013140).\n\nIn his own ethics al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee stresses that the\nProphet\u2014and no other teacher\u2014should be the one person a\nMuslim emulates. He supplements this key Sunni notion with the concept\nof \u201cdisciplining the soul\u201d (riy\u00e2dat\nal-nafs). At birth the essence of the human is deficient and\nignoble and only strict efforts and patient treatment can lead it\ntowards developing virtuous character traits (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\n1937\u201338, book 23). The human soul\u2019s temperament, for\ninstance, becomes imbalanced through the influence of other people and\nneeds to undergo constant disciplining (riy\u00e2da) and\ntraining (tarbiya) in order to keep these character traits at\nequilibrium. Behind this kind of ethics stands the Aristotelian notion\nof entelechy: humans have a natural potential to develop\nrationality and through it acquire virtuous character. Education,\nliterature, religion, and politics should help realizing this\npotential. Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee became acquainted with an ethic that\nfocuses on the development of virtuous character traits through the\nworks of Muslim fal\u00e2sifa like Miskawayh (d. 1030) and\nMuslim scholars like al-R\u00e2ghib al-Isfah\u00e2n\u00ee (d.\nc.1025), who strove to make philosophical notions compatible\nwith Muslim religious scholarship (Madelung 1974). As a result\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee rejected the notion, for instance, that one\nshould try to give up potentially harmful affections like anger or\nsexual desire. These character traits are part of human nature,\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee teaches, and cannot be given up. Rather,\ndisciplining the soul means controlling these potentially harmful\ntraits through one\u2019s rationality (\u2018aql). The\nhuman soul has to undergo constant training and needs to be\ndisciplined similar to a young horse that needs to be broken in,\nschooled, and treated well.\n\nAt no point does al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee reveal the philosophical\norigins of his ethics. He himself saw a close connection between the\nethics of the fal\u00e2sifa and Sufi notions of an ascetic\nand virtuous lifestyle. In his Revival he merges these two\nethical traditions to a successful and influential fusion. In his\nautobiography al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee says that the ethics of the\nfal\u00e2sifa and that of the Sufis are one and the same.\nCongruent with his position that many teachings and arguments of the\nfal\u00e2sifa are taken from earlier revelations and from\nthe divinely inspired insights of mystics, who existed already in\npre-Islamic religions (Treiger 2012, 99\u2013101) he adds that the\nfal\u00e2sifa have taken their ethics from the Sufis,\nmeaning here mystics among the earlier religions\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1959a, 24 = 2000b, 67).\n\nAnother important field where al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee introduced\nAvicennan ideas into Ash\u2019arite kal\u00e2m in a way\nthat this tradition eventually adopted them is human psychology and\nthe rational explanation of prophecy (Griffel 2004, al-Akiti 2004).\nBased on partly mis-translated texts by Aristotle (Hansberger 2011),\nAvicenna developed a psychology that assumes the existence of several\ndistinct faculties of the soul. These faculties are stronger or weaker\nin individual humans. Prophecy is the combination of three faculties\nwhich the prophet has in an extraordinarily strong measure. These\nfaculties firstly allow the prophet to acquire theoretical knowledge\ninstantly without learning, secondly represent this knowledge through\nsymbols and parables as well as divine future events, and thirdly to\nbring about effects outside of his body such as rain or earthquakes.\nThese three faculties exist in every human in a small measure, a fact\nproven by the experience of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, for\ninstance, a phenomenon referred to in the Arabic philosophic tradition\nas \u201cthe veridical dream\u201d (al-man\u00e2m\nal-s\u00e2diq). Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee adopted these teachings\nand appropriated them for his own purposes (Treiger 2012). The\nexistence of the three faculties in human souls that make up prophecy\nserves for him as an explanation of the higher insights that mystics\nsuch as Sufi masters have in comparison to other people. While\nprophets have strong prophetic faculties and ordinary humans very weak\nones, the \u201cfriends of God\u201d (awliy\u00e2\u2019,\ni.e. Sufi masters) stand in between these two. They are endowed with\n\u201cinspiration\u201d (ilh\u00e2m), which is similar to\nprophecy and which serves in al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee as one of the most\nimportant sources of human knoweldge. Unlike Avicenna, for whom\nprophets and maybe also some particularly talented humans\n(\u2019\u00e2rif\u00fbn in his language) acquire the same\nknowledge that philosophers reach through apodictic reasoning, in\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee the prophets and awliy\u00e2\u2019\nhave access to knowledge that is superior to that available solely\nthrough reason. \n\nDespite the significant philosophical influence on\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s ethics, he maintained in Islamic law\n(fiqh) the anti-rationalist Ash\u2019arite position that\nhuman rationality is mute with regard to normative judgments about\nhuman actions and cannot decide whether an action is\n\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d When humans think they know,\nfor instance, that lying is bad, their judgment is determined by a\nconsideration of their benefits. With regard to the ethical value of\nour actions we have a tendency to confuse moral value with benefit. We\ngenerally tend to assume that whatever benefits our collective\ninterest is morally good, while whatever harms us collectively is bad.\nThese judgments, however, are ultimately fallacious and cannot be the\nbasis of jurisprudence (fiqh). \u201cGood\u201d actions are\nthose that are rewarded in the afterlife and \u201cbad\u201d actions\nare those that are punished (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1904\u201307,\n1:61). The kind of connection between human actions and reward or\npunishment in the afterlife can only be learned from revelation\n(Hourani 1976, Marmura 1968\u201369). Muslim jurisprudence is the\nscience that extracts general rules from revelation. Like most\nreligious sciences it aims at advancing humans\u2019 prospect of\nredemption in the world to come. Therefore it must be based on the\nQur\u2019an and the sunna of the Prophet while it uses logic\nand other rational means to extract general rules.\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee was one of the first Muslim jurists who\nintroduced the consideration of a \u201cpublic benefit\u201d\n(maslaha) into Muslim jurisprudence. In addition to\ndeveloping clear guidance of how to gain redemption in the afterlife,\nreligious law (shar\u00ee\u2019a) also aims at creating an\nenvironment that allows each individual wellbeing and the pursuit of a\nvirtuous and pious lifestyle. Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee argues that when\nGod revealed divine law (shar\u00ee\u2019a) He did so with\nthe purpose (maqsad) of advancing human benefits in this\nworld and the next. Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee identifies five\nessential components for wellbeing in this world: religion, life,\nintellect, offspring, and property. Whatever protects these\n\u201cfive necessities\u201d (al-dar\u00fbriyy\u00e2t\nal-khamsa) is considered public benefit (maslaha) and\nshould be advanced, while whatever harms them should be avoided. The\njurisprudent (faq\u00eeh) should aim at safeguarding these\nfive necessities in his legal judgments. In recommending this,\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee practically implies that a \u201cmaslaha\nmursala,\u201d a public benefit that is not mentioned in the\nrevealed text, is considered a valid source of legislation (Opwis 2007\nand 2010, 65\u201388).\n",
