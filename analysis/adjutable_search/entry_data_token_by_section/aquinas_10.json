Around half of the Summa theologiae, the\nmassive second part, is concerned with moral questions, suggesting\nsomething of the importance Aquinas ascribes to ethics in theology. To\nbring some order to this large topic, we can distinguish between three\nparts of the theory:\n\nhis conception of happiness as the goal of human life;\nhis framework for the moral law, grounded in a theory of natural\nlaw;\nhis understanding of the virtues as essential to human\nhappiness.\n\n\n(For wide-ranging treatments of Aquinas\u2019s ethics see McInerny\n1997; MacDonald and Stump 1998; Pope 2002; Irwin 2007: chs\n16\u201324; DeYoung, McCluskey, and Van Dyke 2009; McCluskey\n2017.)\n",
