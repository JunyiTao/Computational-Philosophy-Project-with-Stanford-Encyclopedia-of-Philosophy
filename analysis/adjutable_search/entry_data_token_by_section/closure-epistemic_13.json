    "main_text": "The Argument From Skepticism || Safe Indication and Skepticism\n5.3 Safe Indication and Skepticism\n\nAdvocates of the safe indication theory accept the gist of the\ntracking theorist explanation of the appeal of skepticism but retain\nthe principle of closure. One reason skepticism tempts us is that we\ntend to confuse CR with SI (Sosa 1999, Luper 1984,\n1987c, 2003a). After all, CR\u2014if p were false,\nR would not hold\u2014closely resembles\nSI\u2014R would hold only if p were true.\nWhen we run the two together, we sometimes apply CR and\nconclude that we do not know that skeptical scenarios do not hold.\nThen we shift back to the safe indication account, and go along with\nskeptics when they appeal to the principle of entailment, which is\nsustained by the safe indication account, and conclude that ordinary\nknowledge claims are false. But, as Moore claimed, skeptics are wrong\nwhen they say we do not know that skeptical hypotheses are false.\nRoughly, we know skeptical possibilities do not hold since (given our\ncircumstances) they are remote.\n\nSkepticism might also result from the assumption that, if a belief\nformation method M were, in some situation, to yield a belief\nwithout enabling us to know the truth of that belief, then it cannot\never generate bona fide knowledge (of that sort of belief), no matter\nwhat circumstances it is used in. (M must be strengthened\nsomehow, say with a supplemental method, or with evidence about the\ncircumstances at hand, if knowledge is to be procured.) This\nassumption might rest on the idea that any belief M yields\nis, at best, accidentally correct, if in any circumstances M\nyields a false or an accidentally correct belief (Luper 1987b,c). On\nthis assumption, we can rule out a method of belief formation\nM as a source of knowledge merely by sketching circumstances\nin which M yields a belief that is false or accidentally\ncorrect. Traditional skeptical scenarios suffice; so do Gettieresque\nsituations. Externalist theorists reject the assumption, saying that\nM can generate knowledge when used in circumstances under\nwhich the belief it yields is not accidentally correct. In highly\nGettierized circumstances M must put us in an especially\nstrong epistemic position if M is to generate knowledge; in\nordinary circumstances, less exacting methods can produce knowledge.\nThe standards a method must meet to produce knowledge depend on the\ncontext in which it is used. This view, on which the requirements for\na subject or agent S to know p vary with\nS\u2019s context (e.g., how exacting S\u2019s method of belief\nformation must be to yield knowledge depend on S\u2019s\ncircumstances), might be called agent-centered (or\nsubject) contextualism. Both tracking theorists and\nsafe indication theorists defend agent-centered contextualism.\n",
