How ought the interests of people in the distant future to\nbe taken into account when we make our own decisions? How much of its\noutput should a nation invest for the future? In which assets should\nthat investment be made? What should be the balance among private,\npublic, and communitarian investments in the overall investment that a\ngeneration makes for the future? How much should the world spend in\ncountering global climate change?\n\n\nIn a remarkable paper Frank Ramsey developed a framework in which each\nof these questions can be studied in a form that is precise and\ntractable enough to elicit answers (Ramsey 1928; see, also, Misak\n2020). His approach was to apply the Classical-Utilitarian calculus to\nidentify the best match from among attainable and desirable utility\nstreams over time and across generations. Although very famous today,\nthe paper had no initial impact. Some economists have attributed the\nlack of interest to the paper\u2019s technical character. In\nanswering the question he posed (\u201cHow much of a nation\u2019s\noutput should it save?\u201d), Ramsey had to use the calculus of\nvariations. There is no question but that few economists then knew the\nrequired technicalities. But it is difficult to imagine that there\nwere no economists capable of learning the necessary mathematics had\nthey wished to do so. The reason there was little interest in\nRamsey\u2019s paper lay elsewhere. In the years following the\npublication, a period now known as The Great Depression, the central\neconomic problem in industrialised countries was to find ways to\nincrease employment. Factories lay idle, as did people. The\nunemployment rate in Europe and USA was in the region of 25%. Policies\nthat were needed then had to do with creating incentives for employers\nto hire workers. Even though there were controversies among economists\non what those policies should be, no one doubted that industrialized\nsocieties were facing a problem of the short run. In contrast, Ramsey\naddressed a question involving the long run; and, so as to have an\nuncluttered problem to analyse, he took it as given that there is full\nemployment at every date of both capital and labour.\n\n\nWith the emergence of post-colonial nations following the Second\nWorld War, long run economic development became prominent in economic\nstudies. By the early 1960s it had become clear that Ramsey\u2019s paper is\nthe natural starting point for studying the welfare economics of the\nlong run, not only for pursuing optimum development in centrally\nplanned economies (Chakravarty 1969), but also for use in social\ncost-benefit analysis of public investment in mixed economies (Arrow\nand Kurz 1970), the choice of technology in labour-surplus economies\n(Little and Mirrlees 1968, 1974), and more recently, the welfare\neconomics of climate change (Cline 1992; Nordhaus 1994; Stern 2007).\nThe number of trails Ramsey laid was remarkable. In academic economics\nit is one of the dozen or so most influential papers of the 20th\ncentury.\n\n\nClassical Utilitarianism takes the good to be the expected value of\nthe sum of utilities over time and across the generations (Sidgwick\n1907). Ramsey\u2019s formulation was built on that moral reasoning. He even\nused the term \u201cenjoyment\u201d to interpret utility. The article embodies\nthe sort of ethical deliberation Sen and Williams (1982) called\n\u201cGovernment House Utilitarianism.\u201d But Ramsey\u2019s article thrives today\nbecause Government House needs ethical guidance that isn\u2019t a prop for\npaid Officials to act in nepotistic, never mind predatory ways, but are\ninstead impartial over people\u2019s needs and sensitivities. Although\nRamsey used the Utilitarian language, a generous reading of his paper\nsays that much would be gained if, instead of \u201cenjoyment,\u201d we were to\nwork with the broader notion of \u201cwell-being.\u201d Such a move allows one to\npay greater attention to the factors, be they material or otherwise,\nthat make for flourishing lives.\n",
