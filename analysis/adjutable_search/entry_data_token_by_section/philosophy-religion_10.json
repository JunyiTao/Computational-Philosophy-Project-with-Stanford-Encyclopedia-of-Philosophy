    "main_text": "Philosophical Reflection on Theism and Its Alternatives || God\u2019s Existence\n5.2 God\u2019s Existence\n\nIn some introductory philosophy textbooks and anthologies, the\narguments for God\u2019s existence are presented as ostensible proofs\nwhich are then shown to be fallible. For example, an argument from the\napparent order and purposive nature of the cosmos will be criticized\non the grounds that, at best, the argument would establish there is a\npurposive, designing intelligence at work in the cosmos. This falls\nfar short of establishing that there is a God who is omnipotent,\nomniscient, benevolent, and so on. But two comments need to be made:\nFirst, that \u201cmeager\u201d conclusion alone would be enough to\ndisturb a scientific naturalist who wishes to rule out all such\ntranscendent intelligence. Second, few philosophers today advance a\nsingle argument as a proof. Customarily, a design argument might be\nadvanced alongside an argument from religious experience, and the\nother arguments to be considered below. True to Hempel\u2019s advice\n(cited earlier) about comprehensive inquiry, it is increasingly common\nto see philosophies\u2014scientific naturalism or\ntheism\u2014advanced with cumulative arguments, a whole range of\nconsiderations, and not with a supposed knock-down, single proof.\n\nThis section surveys some of the main theistic arguments.\n5.2.1 Ontological arguments\n\nThere is a host of arguments under this title; version of the argument\nworks, then it can be deployed using only the concept of God as\nmaximally excellent and some modal principles of inference, that is,\nprinciples concerning possibility and necessity. The argument need not\nresist all empirical support, however, as shall be indicated. The\nfocus of the argument is the thesis that, if there is a God, then\nGod\u2019s existence is necessary. In other words, God\u2019s\nexistence is not contingent\u2014God is not the sort of being that\njust happens to exist or not exist. That necessary existence is built\ninto the concept of God can be supported by appealing to the way God\nis conceived in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. This would\ninvolve some a posteriori, empirical research into the way\nGod is thought of in these traditions. Alternatively, a defender of\nthe ontological argument might hope to convince others that the\nconcept of God is the concept of a being that exists necessarily by\nbeginning with the idea of a maximally perfect being. If there were a\nmaximally perfect being, what would it be like? It has been argued\nthat among its array of great-making qualities (omniscience and\nomnipotence) would be necessary existence. Once fully articulated, it\ncan be argued that a maximally perfect being which existed necessarily\ncould be called \u201cGod\u201d. For an interesting, recent\ntreatment of the relationship between the concept of there being a\nnecessarily existing being and there being a God, see Necessary\nExistence by Alexander Pruss and Joshua Rasmussen (2018: chapters\none to three).\n\nThe ontological argument goes back to St. Anselm (1033/34\u20131109),\nbut this section shall explore a current version relying heavily on\nthe principle that if something is possibly necessarily the case, then\nit is necessarily the case (or, to put it redundantly, it is\nnecessarily necessary). The principle can be illustrated in the case\nof propositions. That six is the smallest perfect number (that number\nwhich is equal to the sum of its divisors including one but not\nincluding itself) does not seem to be the sort of thing that might\njust happen to be true. Rather, either it is necessarily true or\nnecessarily false. If the latter, it is not possible, if the former,\nit is possible. If one knows that it is possible that six is the\nsmallest perfect number, then one has good reason to believe that.\nDoes one have reason to think it is possible that God exists\nnecessarily? Defenders of the argument answer in the affirmative and\ninfer that God exists. There have been hundreds of objections and\nreplies to this argument. Perhaps the most ambitious objection is that\nthe same sort of reasoning can be used to argue that God cannot exist;\nfor if it is possible that God not exist and necessary existence is\npart of the meaning of \u201cGod\u201d, then it follows that God\ncannot exist.\n\nClassical, alternative versions of the ontological argument are\npropounded by Anselm, Spinoza, and Descartes, with current versions by\nAlvin Plantinga, Charles Hartshorne, Norman Malcolm, and C. Dore;\nclassical critics include Gaunilo and Kant, and current critics are\nmany, including William Rowe, J. Barnes, G. Oppy, and J. L. Mackie.\nThe latest book-length treatments of the ontological argument are two\ndefenses: Rethinking the Ontological Argument by Daniel\nDombrowski (2006) and Yujin Nagasawa\u2019s Maximal God; A New\nDefence of Perfect Being Theism (2017). Not every advocate of\nperfect being theology embraces the ontological argument. Famously\nThomas Aquinas did not accept the ontological argument. Alvin\nPlantinga, who is one of the philosophers responsible for the revival\nof interest in the ontological argument, contends that while he,\npersonally, takes the argument to be sound (because he believes that\nthe conclusion that God exists necessarily is true, which entails that\nthe premise, that it is possible that God exists necessarily is true)\nhe does not think the argument has sufficient force to convince an\natheist. (Plantinga 1974: 216\u2013217) For a recent new contribution\nto the ontological argument, see Brian Leftow\u2019s\nAnselm\u2019s Argument; Divine Necessity . \n5.2.2 Cosmological arguments\n\nArguments in this vein are more firmly planted in empirical, a\nposteriori reflection than the ontological argument, but some\nversions employ a priori reasons as well. There are various\nversions. Some argue that the cosmos had an initial cause outside it,\na First Cause in time. Others argue that the cosmos has a necessary,\nsustaining cause from instant to instant, whether or not the cosmos\nhad a temporal origin. The two versions are not mutually exclusive,\nfor it is possible both that the cosmos had a First Cause and that it\nhas a continuous, sustaining cause.\n\nThe cosmological argument relies on the intelligibility of the notion\nof there being at least one powerful being which is self-existing or\nwhose origin and continued being does not depend on any other being.\nThis could be either the all-out necessity of supreme pre-eminence\nacross all possible worlds used in versions of the ontological\nargument, or a more local, limited notion of a being that is uncaused\nin the actual world. If successful, the argument would provide reason\nfor thinking there is at least one such being of extraordinary power\nresponsible for the existence of the cosmos. At best, it may not\njustify a full picture of the God of religion (a First Cause would be\npowerful, but not necessarily omnipotent), but it would nonetheless\nchallenge naturalistic alternatives and provide some reason theism.\n(The later point is analogous to the idea that evidence that there was\nsome life on another planet would not establish that such life is\nintelligent, but it increases\u2014perhaps only slightly\u2014the\nhypothesis that there is intelligent life on another planet.)\n\nBoth versions of the argument ask us to consider the cosmos in its\npresent state. Is the world as we know it something that necessarily\nexists? At least with respect to ourselves, the planet, the solar\nsystem and the galaxy, it appears not. With respect to these items in\nthe cosmos, it makes sense to ask why they exist rather than not. In\nrelation to scientific accounts of the natural world, such enquiries\ninto causes make abundant sense and are perhaps even essential\npresuppositions of the natural sciences. Some proponents of the\nargument contend that we know a priori that if something\nexists there is a reason for its existence. So, why does the cosmos\nexist? Arguably, if explanations of the contingent existence of the\ncosmos (or states of the cosmos) are only in terms of other contingent\nthings (earlier states of the cosmos, say), then a full cosmic\nexplanation will never be attained. However, if there is at least one\nnecessarily (non-contingent) being causally responsible for the\ncosmos, the cosmos does have an explanation. At this point the two\nversions of the argument divide.\n\nArguments to a First Cause in time contend that a continuous temporal\nregress from one contingent existence to another would never account\nfor the existence of the cosmos, and they conclude that it is more\nreasonable to accept there was a First Cause than to accept either a\nregress or the claim that the cosmos just came into being from\nnothing. Arguments to a sustaining cause of the cosmos claim that\nexplanations of why something exists now cannot be adequate without\nassuming a present, contemporaneous sustaining cause. The arguments\nhave been based on the denial of all actual infinities or on the\nacceptance of some infinities (for instance, the coherence of\nsupposing there to be infinitely many stars) combined with the\nrejection of an infinite regress of explanations solely involving\ncontingent states of affairs. The latter has been described as a\nvicious regress as opposed to one that is benign. There are plausible\nexamples of vicious infinite regresses that do not generate\nexplanations: for instance, imagine that Tom explains his possession\nof a book by reporting that he got it from A who got it from\nB, and so on to infinity. This would not explain how Tom got\nthe book. Alternatively, imagine a mirror with light reflected in it.\nWould the presence of light be successfully explained if one claimed\nthat the light was a reflection of light from another mirror, and the\nlight in that mirror came from yet another mirror, and so on to\ninfinity? Consider a final case. You come across a word you do not\nunderstand; let it be \u201congggt\u201d. You ask its meaning and\nare given another word which is unintelligible to you, and so on,\nforming an infinite regress. Would you ever know the meaning of the\nfirst term? The force of these cases is to show how similar they are\nto the regress of contingent explanations.\n\nVersions of the argument that reject all actual infinities face the\nembarrassment of explaining what is to be made of the First Cause,\nespecially since it might have some features that are actually\ninfinite. In reply, Craig and others have contended that they have no\nobjection to potential infinities (although the First Cause will never\ncease to be, it will never become an actual infinity). They further\naccept that prior to the creation, the First Cause was not in time, a\nposition relying on the theory that time is relational rather than\nabsolute. The current scientific popularity of the relational view may\noffer support to defenders of the argument.\n\nIt has been objected that both versions of the cosmological argument\nset out an inflated picture of what explanations are reasonable. Why\nshould the cosmos as a whole need an explanation? If everything in the\ncosmos can be explained, albeit through infinite, regressive accounts,\nwhat is left to explain? One may reply either by denying that infinite\nregresses actually do satisfactorily explain, or by charging that the\nfailure to seek an explanation for the whole is arbitrary. The\nquestion, \u201cWhy is there a cosmos?\u201d seems a perfectly\nintelligible one. If there are accounts for things in the cosmos, why\nnot for the whole? The argument is not built on the fallacy of\ntreating every whole as having all the properties of its parts. But if\neverything in the cosmos is contingent, it seems just as reasonable to\nbelieve that the whole cosmos is contingent as it is to believe that\nif everything in the cosmos were invisible, the cosmos as a whole\nwould be invisible.\n\nAnother objection is that rather than explaining the contingent\ncosmos, the cosmological argument introduces a mysterious entity of\nwhich we can make very little philosophical or scientific sense. How\ncan positing at least one First Cause provide a better account of the\ncosmos than simply concluding that the cosmos lacks an ultimate\naccount? In the end, the theist seems bound to admit that why the\nFirst Cause created at all was a contingent matter. If, on the\ncontrary, the theist has to claim that the First Cause had to do what\nit did, would not the cosmos be necessary rather than contingent?\n\nSome theists come close to concluding that it was indeed essential\nthat God created the cosmos. If God is supremely good, there had to be\nsome overflowing of goodness in the form of a cosmos (see Stump &\nKretzmann 1981, on the ideas of Dionysius the Areopagite; see Rowe\n2004 for arguments that God is not free). But theists typically\nreserve some role for the freedom of God and thus seek to retain the\nidea that the cosmos is contingent. Defenders of the cosmological\nargument still contend that its account of the cosmos has a\ncomprehensive simplicity lacking in alternative views. God\u2019s\nchoices may be contingent, but not God\u2019s existence and the\nDivine choice of creating the cosmos can be understood to be\nprofoundly simple in its supreme, overriding endeavor, namely to\ncreate something good. Swinburne has argued that accounting for\nnatural laws in terms of God\u2019s will provides for a simple,\noverarching framework within which to comprehend the order and\npurposive character of the cosmos (see also Foster 2004).\n\nDefenders of the cosmological argument include Swinburne, Richard\nTaylor, Hugo Meynell, Timothy O\u2019Connor, Bruce Reichenbach,\nRobert Koons, Alexander Pruss, and William Rowe; prominent opponents\ninclude Antony Flew, Michael Martin, Howard Sobel, Graham Oppy,\nNicholas Everitt, and J. L Mackie. While Rowe had defended the\ncosmological argument, his reservations about the principle of\nsufficient reason prevents his accepting the argument as fully\nsatisfying.\n5.2.3 Teleological arguments\n\nThese arguments focus on characteristics of the cosmos that seem to\nreflect the design or intentionality of God or, more modestly, of one\nor more powerful, intelligent God-like, purposive forces. Part of the\nargument may be formulated as providing evidence that the cosmos is\nthe sort of reality that would be produced by an intelligent being,\nand then arguing that positing this source is more reasonable than\nagnosticism or denying it. As in the case of the cosmological\nargument, the defender of the teleological argument may want to claim\nit only provides some reason for thinking there is a God. It\nmay be that some kind of cumulative case for theism would require\nconstruing various arguments as mutually reinforcing. If successful in\narguing for an intelligent, trans-cosmos cause, the teleological\nargument may provide some reason for thinking that the First Cause of\nthe cosmological argument (if it is successful) is purposive, while\nthe ontological argument (if it has some probative force) may provides\nsome reason for thinking that it makes sense to posit a being that has\nDivine attributes and necessarily exists. Behind all of them an\nargument from religious experience (to be addressed below) may provide\nsome reasons to seek further support for a religious conception of the\ncosmos and to question the adequacy of naturalism.\n\nOne version of the teleological argument will depend on the\nintelligibility of purposive explanation. In our own human case it\nappears that intentional, purposive explanations are legitimate and\ncan truly account for the nature and occurrence of events. In thinking\nabout an explanation for the ultimate character of the cosmos, is it\nmore likely for the cosmos to be accounted for in terms of a powerful,\nintelligent agent or in terms of a naturalistic scheme of final laws\nwith no intelligence behind them? Theists employing the teleological\nargument draw attention to the order and stability of the cosmos, the\nemergence of vegetative and animal life, the existence of\nconsciousness, morality, rational agents and the like, in an effort to\nidentify what might plausibly be seen as purposive explicable features\nof the cosmos. Naturalistic explanations, whether in biology or\nphysics, are then cast as being comparatively local in application\nwhen held up against the broader schema of a theistic metaphysics.\nDarwinian accounts of biological evolution will not necessarily assist\nus in thinking through why there are either any such laws or any\norganisms to begin with. Arguments supporting and opposing the\nteleological argument will then resemble arguments about the\ncosmological argument, with the negative side contending that there is\nno need to move beyond a naturalistic account, and the positive side\naiming to establish that failing to go beyond naturalism is\nunreasonable.\n\nIn assessing the teleological argument, consider the objection from\nuniqueness. The cosmos is utterly unique. There is no access to\nmultiple universes, some of which are known to be designed and some\nare known not to be. Without being able o compare the cosmos to\nalternative sets of cosmic worlds, the argument fails. Replies to this\nobjection have contended that were we to insist that inferences in\nunique cases are out of order, then this would rule out otherwise\nrespectable scientific accounts of the origin of the cosmos. Besides,\nwhile it is not possible to compare the layout of different cosmic\nhistories, it is in principle possible to envisage worlds that seem\nchaotic, random, or based on laws that cripple the emergence of life.\nNow we can envisage an intelligent being creating such worlds, but,\nthrough considering their features, we can articulate some marks of\npurposive design to help judge whether the cosmos is more reasonably\nbelieved to be designed rather than not designed. Some critics appeal\nto the possibility that the cosmos has an infinite history to bolster\nand re-introduce the uniqueness objection. Given infinite time and\nchance, it seems likely that something like our world will come into\nexistence, with all its appearance of design. If so, why should we\ntake it to be so shocking that our world has its apparent design, and\nwhy should explaining the world require positing one or more\nintelligent designers? Replies repeat the earlier move of insisting\nthat if the objection were to be decisive, then many seemingly\nrespectable accounts would also have to fall by the wayside. It is\noften conceded that the teleological argument does not demonstrate\nthat one or more designers are required; it seeks rather to establish\nthat positing such purposive intelligence is reasonable and preferable\nto naturalism. Recent defenders of the argument include George\nSchlesinger, Robin Collins, and Richard Swinburne. It is rejected by\nJ. L. Mackie, Michael Martin, Nicholas Everitt, and many others.\n\nOne feature of the teleological argument currently receiving increased\nattention focuses on epistemology. It has been argued by Richard\nTaylor (1963), Alvin Plantinga (2011 and in Beilby 2002), and others\nthat if we reasonably rely on our cognitive faculties, it is\nreasonable to believe that these are not brought about by naturalistic\nforces\u2014forces that are entirely driven by chance or are the\noutcome of processes not formed by an overriding intelligence. An\nillustration may help to understand the argument. Imagine Tom coming\nacross what appears to be a sign reporting some information about his\ncurrent altitude (some rocks in a configuration giving him his current\nlocation and precise height above sea-level in meters). If he had\nreason to believe that this \u201csign\u201d was totally the result\nof chance configurations, would he be reasonable to trust it? Some\ntheists argue that it would not be reasonable, and that trusting our\ncognitive faculties requires us to accept that they were formed by an\noverarching, good, creative agent. This rekindles Descartes\u2019\npoint about relying on the goodness of God to ensure that our\ncognitive faculties are in good working order. Objections to this\nargument center on naturalistic explanations, especially those\nfriendly to evolution. In evolutionary epistemology, one tries to\naccount for the reliability of cognitive faculties in terms of trial\nand error leading to survival. A rejoinder by theists is that survival\nalone is not necessarily linked to true beliefs. It could, in\nprinciple, be false beliefs that enhance survival. In fact, some\natheists think that believing in God has been crucial to\npeople\u2019s survival, though the belief is radically false.\nEvolutionary epistemologists reply that the lack of a\nnecessary link between beliefs that promote survival and\ntruth and the fact that some false beliefs or unreliable belief\nproducing mechanisms promote survival nor falls far short of\nundermining evolutionary epistemology. See Martin (1990), Mackie\n(1983), and Tooley (see Tooley\u2019s chapters 2, 4, and 6 in\nPlantinga & Tooley 2008), among others, object to the epistemic\nteleological argument.\n\nAnother recent development in teleological argumentation has involved\nan argument from fine-tuning.\n\nFine tuning arguments contend that life would not exist were it not\nfor the fact that multiple physical parameters (e.g., the cosmological\nconstant and the ratio of the mass of the neutron to the mass of the\nproton) have numerical values that fall within a range of values known\nto be life-permitting that is very narrow compared to the range of\nvalues that are compatible with current physical theory and are known\nto be life-prohibiting. For example, even minor changes to the nuclear\nweak force would not have allowed for stars, nor would stars have\nendured if the ratio of electromagnetism to gravity had been much\ndifferent. John Leslie observes: \n\n\nAlterations by less than one part in a billion to the expansion speed\nearly in the Big Bang would have led to runaway expansion, everything\nquickly becoming so dilute that no stars could have formed, or else to\ngravitational collapse inside under a second. (Leslie 2007: 76) \n\n\nRobin Collins and others have argued that theism better accounts for\nthe fine tuning than naturalism (see Collins 2009; for criticism of\nthe argument, see Craig & Smith 1993). For a collection of\narticles covering both sides of the debate and both biological and\ncosmological design arguments, see Manson 2003.\n\nA more sustained objection against virtually all versions of the\nteleological argument takes issue with the assumption that the cosmos\nis good or that it is the sort of thing that would be brought about by\nan intelligent, completely benevolent being. This leads us directly to\nthe next central concern of the philosophy of God. \n5.2.4 Problems of evil\n\nIf there is a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and completely good,\nwhy is there evil? The problem of evil is the most widely considered\nobjection to theism in both Western and Eastern philosophy. There are\ntwo general versions of the problem: the deductive or logical version,\nwhich asserts that the existence of any evil at all (regardless of its\nrole in producing good) is incompatible with God\u2019s existence;\nand the probabilistic version, which asserts that given the quantity\nand severity of evil that actually exists, it is unlikely that God\nexists. The deductive problem is currently less commonly debated\nbecause many (but not all) philosophers acknowledge that a thoroughly\ngood being might allow or inflict some harm under certain morally\ncompelling conditions (such as causing a child pain when removing a\nsplinter). More intense debate concerns the likelihood (or even\npossibility) that there is a completely good God given the vast amount\nof evil in the cosmos. Such evidential arguments from evil may be\ndeductive or inductive arguments but they include some attempt to show\nthat some known fact about evil bears a negative evidence relation to\ntheism (e.g., it lowers its probability or renders it improbable)\nwhether or not it is logically incompatible with theism. Consider\nhuman and animal suffering caused by death, predation, birth defects,\nravaging diseases, virtually unchecked human wickedness, torture,\nrape, oppression, and \u201cnatural disasters\u201d. Consider how\noften those who suffer are innocent. Why should there be so much\ngratuitous, apparently pointless evil?\n\nIn the face of the problem of evil, some philosophers and theologians\ndeny that God is all-powerful and all-knowing. John Stuart Mill took\nthis line, and panentheist theologians today also question the\ntraditional treatments of Divine power. According to panentheism, God\nis immanent in the world, suffering with the oppressed and working to\nbring good out of evil, although in spite of God\u2019s efforts, evil\nwill invariably mar the created order. Another response is to think of\nGod as being very different from a moral agent. Brian Davies and\nothers have contended that what it means for God to be good is\ndifferent from what it means for an agent to be morally good (Davies\n2006). See also Mark Murphy\u2019s 2017 book God\u2019s Own\nEthics; Norms of Divine Agency and the Argument from Evil. A\ndifferent, more substantial strategy is to deny the existence of evil,\nbut it is difficult to reconcile traditional monotheism with moral\nskepticism. Also, insofar as we believe there to be a God worthy of\nworship and a fitting object of human love, the appeal to moral\nskepticism will carry little weight. The idea that evil is a privation\nor twisting of the good may have some currency in thinking through the\nproblem of evil, but it is difficult to see how it alone could go very\nfar to vindicate belief in God\u2019s goodness. Searing pain and\nendless suffering seem altogether real even if they are analyzed as\nbeing philosophically parasitic on something valuable. The three great\nmonotheistic, Abrahamic traditions, with their ample insistence on the\nreality of evil, offer little reason to try to defuse the problem of\nevil by this route. Indeed, classical Judaism, Christianity, and Islam\nare so committed to the existence of evil that a reason to reject evil\nwould be a reason to reject these religious traditions. What would be\nthe point of the Judaic teaching about the Exodus (God liberating the\npeople of Israel from slavery), or the Christian teaching about the\nincarnation (Christ revealing God as love and releasing a Divine power\nthat will, in the end, conquer death), or the Islamic teaching of\nMohammed (the holy prophet of Allah, whom is all-just and\nall-merciful) if slavery, hate, death, and injustice did not\nexist?\n\nIn part, the magnitude of the difficulty one takes the problem of evil\nto pose for theism will depend upon one\u2019s commitments in other\nareas of philosophy, especially ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics.\nIf in ethics you hold that there should be no preventable suffering\nfor any reason, regardless of the cause or consequence, then the\nproblem of evil will conflict with your acceptance of traditional\ntheism. Moreover, if you hold that any solution to the problem of evil\nshould be evident to all persons, then again traditional theism is in\njeopardy, for clearly the \u201csolution\u201d is not evident to\nall. Debate has largely centered on the legitimacy of adopting some\nmiddle position: a theory of values that would preserve a clear\nassessment of the profound evil in the cosmos as well as some\nunderstanding of how this might be compatible with the existence of an\nall powerful, completely good Creator. Could there be reasons why God\nwould permit cosmic ills? If we do not know what those reasons might\nbe, are we in a position to conclude that there are none or that there\ncould not be any? Exploring different possibilities will be shaped by\none\u2019s metaphysics. For example, if you do not believe there is\nfree will, then you will not be moved by any appeal to the positive\nvalue of free will and its role in bringing about good as offsetting\nits role in bringing about evil.\n\nTheistic responses to the problem of evil distinguish between a\ndefense and a theodicy. A defense seeks to establish that rational\nbelief that God exists is still possible (when the defense is employed\nagainst the logical version of the problem of evil) and that the\nexistence of evil does not make it improbable that God exists (when\nused against the probabilistic version). Some have adopted the defense\nstrategy while arguing that we are in a position to have rational\nbelief in the existence of evil and in a completely good God who hates\nthis evil, even though we may be unable to see how these two beliefs\nare compatible. A theodicy is more ambitious and is typically part of\na broader project, arguing that it is reasonable to believe that God\nexists on the basis of the good as well as the evident evil of the\ncosmos. In a theodicy, the project is not to account for each and\nevery evil, but to provide an overarching framework within which to\nunderstand at least roughly how the evil that occurs is part of some\noverall good\u2014for instance, the overcoming of evil is itself a\ngreat good. In practice, a defense and a theodicy often appeal to\nsimilar factors, the first and foremost being what many call the\nGreater Good Defense.\n5.2.5 Evil and the greater good\n\nIn the Greater Good Defense, it is contended that evil can be\nunderstood as either a necessary accompaniment to bringing about\ngreater goods or an integral part of these goods. Thus, in a version\noften called the Free Will Defense, it is proposed that free creatures\nwho are able to care for each other and whose welfare depends on each\nother\u2019s freely chosen action constitute a good. For this good to\nbe realized, it is argued, there must be the bona fide\npossibility of persons harming each other. The free will defense is\nsometimes used narrowly only to cover evil that occurs as a result,\ndirect or indirect, of human action. But it has been speculatively\nextended by those proposing a defense rather than a theodicy to cover\nother evils which might be brought about by supernatural agents other\nthan God. According to the Greater Good case, evil provides an\nopportunity to realize great values, such as the virtues of courage\nand the pursuit of justice. Reichenbach (1982), Tennant (1930),\nSwinburne (1979), and van Inwagen (2006) have also underscored the\ngood of a stable world of natural laws in which animals and humans\nlearn about the cosmos and develop autonomously, independent of the\ncertainty that God exists. Some atheists accord value to the good of\nliving in a world without God, and these views have been used by\ntheists to back up the claim that God might have had reason to create\na cosmos in which Divine existence is not overwhelmingly obvious to\nus. If God\u2019s existence were overwhelmingly obvious, then\nmotivations to virtue might be clouded by self-interest and by the\nbare fear of offending an omnipotent being. Further, there may even be\nsome good to acting virtuously even if circumstances guarantee a\ntragic outcome. John Hick (1966 [1977]) so argued and has developed\nwhat he construes to be an Irenaean approach to the problem of evil\n(named after St. Irenaeus of the second century). On this approach, it\nis deemed good that humanity develops the life of virtue gradually,\nevolving to a life of grace, maturity, and love. This contrasts with a\ntheodicy associated with St. Augustine, according to which God made us\nperfect and then allowed us to fall into perdition, only to be\nredeemed later by Christ. Hick thinks the Augustinian model fails\nwhereas the Irenaean one is credible.\n\nSome have based an argument from the problem of evil on the charge\nthat this is not the best possible world. If there were a supreme,\nmaximally excellent God, surely God would bring about the best\npossible creation. Because this is not the best possible creation,\nthere is no supreme, maximally excellent God. Following Adams (1987),\nmany now reply that the whole notion of a best possible world, like\nthe highest possible number, is incoherent. For any world that can be\nimagined with such and such happiness, goodness, virtue and so on, a\nhigher one can be imagined. If the notion of a best possible world is\nincoherent, would this count against belief that there could be a\nsupreme, maximally excellent being? It has been argued on the contrary\nthat Divine excellences admit of upper limits or maxima that are not\nquantifiable in a serial fashion (for example, Divine omnipotence\ninvolves being able to do anything logically or metaphysically\npossible, but does not require actually doing the greatest number of\nacts or a series of acts of which there can be no more).\n\nThose concerned with the problem of evil clash over the question of\nhow one assesses the likelihood of Divine existence. Someone who\nreports seeing no point to the existence of evil or no justification\nfor God to allow it seems to imply that if there were a point they\nwould see it. Note the difference between seeing no point and not\nseeing a point. In the cosmic case, is it clear that if there were a\nreason justifying the existence of evil, we would see it? William Rowe\nthinks some plausible understanding of God\u2019s justificatory\nreason for allowing the evil should be detectable, but that there are\ncases of evil that are altogether gratuitous. Defenders like William\nHasker (1989) and Stephen Wykstra (1984) reply that these cases are\nnot decisive counter-examples to the claim that there is a good God.\nThese philosophers hold that we can recognize evil and grasp our duty\nto do all in our power to prevent or alleviate it. But we should not\ntake our failure to see what reason God might have for allowing evil\nto count as grounds for thinking that there is no reason. This later\nmove has led to a position commonly called skeptical theism.\nMichael Bergmann, Michael Rea, William Alston and others have argued\nthat we have good reason to be skeptical about whether we can assess\nwhether ostensibly gratuitous evils may or may not be permitted by an\nall-good God (Bergmann 2012a and 2012b, 2001; Bergmann & Rea 2005;\nfor criticism see Almeida & Oppy 2003; Draper 2014, 2013, 1996).\nOverall, it needs to be noted that from the alleged fact that we would\nbe unlikely to see a reason for God to allow some evil if there were\none, it only follows that our failure to see such a reason is not\nstrong evidence against theism.\n\nFor an interesting practical application of the traditional problem of\nevil to the topic of the ethics of procreation, see Marsh 2015. It has\nbeen argued that if one does believe that the world is not good, then\nthat can provide a prima facie reason against procreation.\nWhy should one bring children into a world that is not good? Another\ninteresting, recent development in the philosophy of religion\nliterature has been the engagement of philosophers with ostensible\nevils that God commands in the Bible (see Bergmann, Murray, & Rea\n2010). For a fascinating engagement with the problem of evil that\nemploys Biblical narratives, see Eleonore Stumps\u2019 Wandering\nin Darkness (2010). The treatment of the problem of evil has also\nextended to important reflection on the suffering of non-human animals\n(see S. Clark 1987, 1995, 2017; Murray 2008; Meister 2018). Problems\nraised by evil and suffering are multifarious and are being addressed\nby contemporary philosophers across the religious and non-religious\nspectrums. See, for example, The History of Evil edited by\nMeister and Taliaferro, in six volumes with over 130 contributors from\nvirtually all religious and secular points of view, and the recent\nThe Cambridge Companion to the Problem of Evil edited by\nMeister and Moser (2017).\n\nSome portraits of an afterlife seem to have little bearing on our\nresponse to the magnitude of evil here and now. Does it help to\nunderstand why God allows evil if all victims will receive happiness\nlater? But it is difficult to treat the possibility of an afterlife as\nentirely irrelevant. Is death the annihilation of persons or an event\ninvolving a transfiguration to a higher state? If you do not think\nthat it matters whether persons continue to exist after death, then\nsuch speculation is of little consequence. But suppose that the\nafterlife is understood as being morally intertwined with this life,\nwith opportunity for moral and spiritual reformation, transfiguration\nof the wicked, rejuvenation and occasions for new life, perhaps even\nreconciliation and communion between oppressors seeking forgiveness\nand their victims. Then these considerations might help to defend\nagainst arguments based on the existence of evil. Insofar as one\ncannot rule out the possibility of an afterlife morally tied to our\nlife, one cannot rule out the possibility that God brings some good\nout of cosmic ills. For two recent arguments against a positive\ntheistic appeal to an afterlife, see Sterba 2019 141\u2013156, and\nEkstrom 2021;131\u2013155 \u2014 compare with Mawson 2016. \n\nThe most recent work on the afterlife in philosophy of religion has\nfocused on the compatibility of an individual afterlife with some\nforms of physicalism. Arguably, a dualist treatment of human persons\nis more promising. If you are not metaphysically identical with your\nbody, then perhaps the annihilation of your body is not the\nannihilation of you. Today, a range of philosophers have argued that\neven if physicalism is true, an afterlife is still possible (Peter van\nInwagen, Lynne Baker, Trenton Merricks, Kevin Corcoran). The import of\nthis work for the problem of evil is that the possible redemptive\nvalue of an afterlife should not be ruled out (without argument) if\none assumes physicalism to be true. (For an extraordinary, rich\nresource on the relevant literature, see The Oxford Handbook of\nEschatology, edited by J. Walls, 2007.)\n5.2.6 Religious experience\n\nPerhaps the justification most widely offered for religious belief\nconcerns the occurrence of religious experience or the cumulative\nweight of testimony of those claiming to have had religious\nexperiences. Putting the latter case in theistic terms, the argument\nappeals to the fact that many people have testified that they have\nfelt God\u2019s presence. Does such testimony provide evidence that\nGod exists? That it is evidence has been argued by Jerome Gellman,\nKeith Yandell, William Alston, Caroline Davis, Gary Gutting, Kai-Man\nKwan, Richard Swinburne, Charles Taliaferro, and others. That it is\nnot (or that its evidential force is trivial) is argued by Michael\nMartin, J. L. Mackie, Kai Nielson, Matthew Bagger, John Schellenberg,\nWilliam Rowe, Graham Oppy, and others. In an effort to stimulate\nfurther investigation, consider the following sketch of some of the\nmoves and countermoves in the debate. \n\nObjection: Religious experience cannot be experience\nof God for perceptual experience is only sensory and if God is\nnon-physical, God cannot be sensed.\n\nReply: The thesis that perceptual experience is only\nsensory can be challenged. Yandell marks out some experiences (as when\none has \u201ca feeling\u201d someone is present but without having\nany accompanying sensations) that might provide grounds for\nquestioning a narrow sensory notion of perceptual experience.\n\nObjection: Testimony to have experienced God is only\ntestimony that one thinks one has experienced God; it is only\ntestimony of a conviction, not evidence.\n\nReply: The literature on religious experience\ntestifies to the existence of experience of some Divine being on the\nbasis of which the subject comes to think the experience is of God. If\nread charitably, the testimony is not testimony to a conviction, but\nto experiences that form the grounds for the conviction. (See Bagger\n1999 for a vigorous articulation of this objection, and note the reply\nby Kai-man Kwam 2003).\n\nObjection: Because religious experience is unique,\nhow could one ever determine whether it is reliable? We simply lack\nthe ability to examine the object of religious experience in order to\ntest whether the reported experiences are indeed reliable.\n\nReply: As we learned from Descartes, all our\nexperiences of external objects face a problem of uniqueness. It is\npossible in principle that all our senses are mistaken and we do not\nhave the public, embodied life we think we lead. We cannot step out of\nour own subjectivity to vindicate our ordinary perceptual beliefs any\nmore than in the religious case. (See the debate between William\nAlston [2004] and Evan Fales [2004]).\n\nObjection: Reports of religious experience differ\nradically and the testimony of one religious party neutralizes the\ntestimony of others. The testimony of Hindus cancels out the testimony\nof Christians. The testimony of atheists to experience God\u2019s\nabsence cancels out the testimony of \u201cbelievers\u201d.\n\nReply: Several replies might be offered here.\nTestimony to experience the absence of God might be better understood\nas testimony not to experience God. Failing to experience God might be\njustification for believing that there is no God only to the extent\nthat we have reason to believe that if God exists God would be\nexperienced by all. Theists might even appeal to the claim by many\natheists that it can be virtuous to live ethically with atheist\nbeliefs. Perhaps if there is a God, God does not think this is\naltogether bad, and actually desires religious belief to be fashioned\nunder conditions of trust and faith rather than knowledge. The\ndiversity of religious experiences has caused some defenders of the\nargument from religious experience to mute their conclusion. Thus,\nGutting (1982) contends that the argument is not strong enough to\nfully vindicate a specific religious tradition, but that it is strong\nenough to overturn an anti-religious naturalism. Other defenders use\ntheir specific tradition to deal with ostensibly competing claims\nbased on different sorts of religious experiences. Theists have\nproposed that more impersonal experiences of the Divine represent only\none aspect of God. God is a person or is person-like, but God can also\nbe experienced, for example, as sheer luminous unity. Hindus have\nclaimed the experience of God as personal is only one stage in the\noverall journey of the soul to truth, the highest truth being that\nBrahman transcends personhood. (For a discussion of these objections\nand replies and references, see Taliaferro 1998.)\n\nHow one settles the argument will depend on one\u2019s overall\nconvictions in many areas of philosophy. The holistic, interwoven\nnature of both theistic and atheistic arguments can be readily\nillustrated. If you diminish the implications of religious experience\nand have a high standard regarding the burden of proof for any sort of\nreligious outlook, then it is highly likely that the classical\narguments for God\u2019s existence will not be persuasive. Moreover,\nif one thinks that theism can be shown to be intellectually confused\nfrom the start, then theistic arguments from religious experience will\ncarry little weight. Testimony to have experienced God will have no\nmore weight than testimony to have experienced a round square, and\nnon-religious explanations of religious experience\u2014like those of\nFreud (a result of wish-fulfillment), Marx (a reflection of the\neconomic base), or Durkheim (a product of social forces)\u2014will\nincrease their appeal. If, on the other hand, you think the theistic\npicture is coherent and that the testimony of religious experience\nprovides some evidence for theism, then your assessment of the\nclassical theistic arguments might be more favorable, for they would\nserve to corroborate and further support what you already have some\nreason to believe. From such a vantage point, appeal to\nwish-fulfillment, economics, and social forces might have a role, but\nthe role is to explain why some parties do not have experiences of God\nand to counter the charge that failure to have such experiences\nprovides evidence that there is no religious reality. (For an\nexcellent collection of recent work on explaining the emergence and\ncontinuation of religious experience, see Schloss & Murray (eds.)\n2009.)\n\nThere is not space to cover the many other arguments for and against\nthe existence of God, but several additional arguments are briefly\nnoted. The argument from miracles starts from specific extraordinary\nevents, arguing that they provide reasons for believing there to be a\nsupernatural agent or, more modestly, reasons for skepticism about the\nsufficiency of a naturalistic world view. The argument has attracted\nmuch philosophical attention, especially since David Hume\u2019s\nrejection of miracles. The debate has turned mainly on how one defines\na miracle, understands the laws of nature, and specifies the\nprinciples of evidence that govern the explanation of highly unusual\nhistorical occurrences. There is considerable debate over whether\nHume\u2019s case against miracles simply begs the question against\n\u201cbelievers\u201d. Detailed exposition is impossible in this\nshort entry. Taliaferro has argued elsewhere that Hume\u2019s case\nagainst the rationality of belief in miracles is best seen as part of\nhis overall case for a form of naturalism (Taliaferro 2005b).\n\nThere are various arguments that are advanced to motivate religious\nbelief. One of the most interesting and popular is a wager argument\noften associated with Pascal (1623\u20131662). It is designed to\noffer practical reasons to cultivate a belief in God. Imagine that you\nare unsure whether there is or is not a God. You have it within your\npower to live on either assumption and perhaps, through various\npractices, to get yourself to believe one or the other. There would be\ngood consequences of believing in God even if your belief were false,\nand if the belief were true you would receive even greater good. There\nwould also be good consequences of believing that there is no God, but\nin this case the consequences would not alter if you were correct. If,\nhowever, you believe that there is no God and you are wrong, then you\nwould risk losing the many goods which follow from the belief that God\nexists and from actual Divine existence. On this basis, it may seem\nreasonable to believe there is a God.\n\nIn different forms the argument may be given a rough edge (for\nexample, imagine that if you do not believe in God and there is a God,\nhell is waiting). It may be put as an appeal to individual\nself-interest (you will be better off) or more generally (believers\nwhose lives are bound together can realize some of the goods\ncomprising a mature religious life). Objectors worry about whether one\never is able to bring choices down to just such a narrow\nselection\u2014for example, to choose either theism or naturalism.\nSome think the argument is too thoroughly egotistic and thus offensive\nto religion. Many of these objections have generated some plausible\nreplies (Rescher 1985). (For a thoroughgoing exploration of the\nrelevant arguments, see the collection of essays edited by Jeffrey\nJordan (1994).)\n\nRecent work on Pascalian wagering has a bearing on work on the nature\nof faith (is it voluntary or involuntary?), its value (when, if ever,\nis it a virtue?), and relation to evidence (insofar as faith involves\nbelief, is it possible to have faith without evidence?). For an\noverview and promising analysis, see Chappell (1996), Swinburne\n(1979), Schellenberg (2005), and Rota (2016). A promising feature of\nsuch new work is that it is often accompanied by a rich understanding\nof revelation that is not limited to a sacred scripture, but sees a\nrevelatory role in scripture plus the history of its interpretation,\nthe use of creeds, icons, and so on (see the work of William Abraham\n[1998]).\n\nA burgeoning question in recent years is whether the cognitive science\nof religion (CSR) has significance for the truth or rationality of\nreligious commitment. According to CSR, belief in supernatural agents\nappears to be cognitively natural (Barrett 2004, Kelemen 2004, Dennett\n2006, De Cruz, H., & De Smedt, J. 2010) and easy to spread (Boyer\n2001). The naturalness of religion thesis has led some, including\nAlvin Plantinga it seems (2011: 60), to imply that we have scientific\nevidence for Calvin\u2019s sensus divinitatis. But others\nhave argued that CSR can intensify the problem of divine hiddenness,\nsince diverse religious concepts are cognitively natural and early\nhumans seem to have lacked anything like a theistic concept (Marsh\n2013). There are many other questions being investigated about CSR,\nsuch as whether it provides a debunking challenge to religion (Murray\n& Schloss 2009), whether it poses a cultural challenge for\nreligious outlooks like Schellenberg\u2019s Ultimism (Marsh 2014),\nand whether it challenges human dignity (Audi 2013). Needless to say,\nat the present time, there is nothing like a clear consensus on\nwhether CSR should be seen as worrisome, welcome, or neither, by\nreligious believers.\n\nFor some further work on the framework of assessing the evidence for\nand against theism (and other religious and secular worldviews) see C.\nS. Evans 2010, Chandler and Harrison 2012. In the last twenty years\nthere has been increasing attention given to the aesthetic dimension\nof arguments for and against religiously significant conceptions of\nultimate reality and of the meaning of life (see Brown 2004; Wynn\n2013; Hedley 2016; Mawson 2016; Taliaferro & Evans 2010, 2013,\n2021). For its breadth and nuanced use of philosophy and\naesthetics, see Anthony O\u2019Hear\u2019s 2020 work\nTranscendence, Creation and Incarnation.\n\n6. Religious Pluralism\n\nIn the midst of the new work on religious traditions, there has been a\nsteady, growing representation of non-monotheistic traditions. An\nearly proponent of this expanded format was Ninian Smart\n(1927\u20132001), who, through many publications, scholarly as well\nas popular, secured philosophies of Hinduism and Buddhism as\ncomponents in the standard canon of English-speaking philosophy of\nreligion. \n\nSmart championed the thesis that there are genuine differences between\nreligious traditions. He therefore resisted seeing some core\nexperience as capturing the essential identity of being religious.\nUnder Smart\u2019s tutelage, there has been considerable growth in\ncross-cultural philosophy of religion. Wilfred Cantwell Smith\n(1916\u20132000) also did a great deal to improve the representation\nof non-Western religions and reflection. See, for example, the\nRoutledge series Investigating Philosophy of Religion with\nRoutledge with volumes already published or forthcoming on Buddhism\n(Burton 2017), Hinduism (Ranganathan 2018), Daoism, and Confucianism.\nThe five volume Encyclopedia of Philosophy of Religion\n(mentioned earlier) to be published by Wiley Blackwell (projected for\n2021) will have ample contributions on the widest spectrum of\nphilosophical treatments of diverse religions to date.\n\nThe explanation of philosophy of religion has involved fresh\ntranslations of philosophical and religious texts from India, China,\nSoutheast Asia, and Africa. Exceptional figures from non-Western\ntraditions have an increased role in cross-cultural philosophy of\nreligion and religious dialogue. The late Bimal Krishna Matilal\n(1935\u20131991) made salient contributions to enrich Western\nexposure to Indian philosophy of religion (see Matilal 1882). Among\nthe mid-twentieth-century Asian philosophers, two who stand out for\nspecial note are T.R.V. Murti (1955) and S.N. Dasgupta\n(1922\u20131955). Both brought high philosophical standards along\nwith the essential philology to educate Western thinkers. As evidence\nof non-Western productivity in the Anglophone world, see Arvind Sharma\n1990 and 1995. There are now extensive treatments of pantheism and\nstudent-friendly guides to diverse religious conceptions of the\ncosmos. \n\nThe expanded interest in religious pluralism has led to extensive\nreflection on the compatibility and possible synthesis of religions.\nJohn Hick is the preeminent synthesizer of religious traditions. Hick\n(1973 a and b)) advanced a complex picture of the afterlife involving\ncomponents from diverse traditions. Over many publications and many\nyears, Hick has moved from a broadly based theistic view of God to\nwhat Hick calls \u201cthe Real\u201d, a noumenal sacred reality.\nHick claims that different religions provide us with a glimpse or\npartial access to the Real. In an influential article, \u201cThe New\nMap of the Universe of Faiths\u201d (1973a), Hick raised the\npossibility that many of the great world religions are revelatory of\nthe Real. \n\n\nSeen in [an] historical context these movements of faith\u2014the\nJudaic-Christian, the Buddhist, the Hindu, the Muslim\u2014are not\nessentially rivals. They began at different times and in different\nplaces, and each expanded outwards into the surrounding world of\nprimitive natural religion until most of the world was drawn up into\none or the other of the great revealed faiths. And once this global\npattern had become established it has ever since remained fairly\nstable\u2026 Then in Persia the great prophet Zoroaster appeared;\nChina produced Lao-tzu and then the Buddha lived, the Mahavira, the\nfounder of the Jain religion and, probably about the end of this\nperiod, the writing of the Bhagavad Gita; and Greece produced\nPythagoras and then, ending this golden age, Socrates and Plato. Then\nafter the gap of some three hundred years came Jesus of Nazareth and\nthe emergence of Christianity; and after another gap the prophet\nMohammed and the rise of Islam. The suggestion that we must\nconsider is that these were all movements of the divine\nrevelation. (Hick 1989: 136; emphasis added)\n\n\nHick sees these traditions, and others as well, as different meeting\npoints in which a person might be in relation to the same reality or\nthe Real: \n\n\nThe great world faiths embody different perceptions and conceptions\nof, and correspondingly different responses to, the Real from within\nthe major variant ways of being human; and that within each of them\nthe transformation of human existence from self-centeredness to\nReality-centeredness is taking place. (1989: 240) \n\n\nHick uses Kant to develop his central thesis. \n\n\nKant distinguishes between noumenon and phenomenon, or between a\nDing an sich [the thing itself] and the thing as it appears\nto human consciousness\u2026. In this strand of Kant\u2019s\nthought\u2014not the only strand, but the one which I am seeking to\npress into service in the epistemology of religion\u2014the noumenal\nworld exists independently of our perception of it and the phenomenal\nworld is that same world as it appears to our human\nconsciousness\u2026. I want to say that the noumenal Real is\nexperienced and thought by different human mentalities, forming and\nformed by different religious traditions, as the range of gods and\nabsolutes which the phenomenology of religion reports. (1989:\n241\u2013242)\n\n\nOne advantage of Hick\u2019s position is that it undermines a\nrationale for religious conflict. If successful, this approach would\noffer a way to accommodate diverse communities and undermine what has\nbeen a source of grave conflict in the past. \n\nHick\u2019s work since the early 1980s provided an impetus for not\ntaking what appears to be religious conflict as outright\ncontradictions. He advanced a philosophy of religion that paid careful\nattention to the historical and social context. By doing so, Hick\nthought that apparently conflicting descriptions of the sacred could\nbe reconciled as representing different perspectives on the same\nreality, the Real (see Hick 2004, 2006).\n\nThe response to Hick\u2019s proposal has been mixed. Some contend\nthat the very concept of \u201cthe Real\u201d is incoherent or not\nreligiously adequate. Indeed, articulating the nature of the Real is\nno easy task. Hick writes that the Real \n\n\ncannot be said to be one thing or many, person or thing, substance or\nprocess, good or bad, purposive or non-purposive. None of the concrete\ndescriptions that apply within the realm of human experience can apply\nliterally to the unexperienceable ground of that realm\u2026. We\ncannot even speak of this as a thing or an entity. (1989: 246). \n\n\nIt has been argued that Hick has secured not the equal acceptability\nof diverse religions but rather their unacceptability. In their\nclassical forms, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity diverge. If, say,\nthe Incarnation of God in Christ did not occur, isn\u2019t\nChristianity false? In reply, Hick has sought to interpret specific\nclaims about the Incarnation in ways that do not commit Christians to\nthe \u201cliteral truth\u201d of God becoming enfleshed. The\n\u201ctruth\u201d of the Incarnation has been interpreted in such\nterms as these: in Jesus Christ (or in the narratives about Christ)\nGod is disclosed. Or: Jesus Christ was so united with God\u2019s will\nthat his actions were and are the functional display of God\u2019s\ncharacter. Perhaps as a result of Hick\u2019s challenge,\nphilosophical work on the incarnation and other beliefs and practice\nspecific to religious traditions have received renewed attention (see,\nfor example, Taliaferro and Meister 2009). Hick has been a leading,\nwidely appreciated force in the expansion of philosophy of religion in\nthe late twentieth century. \n\nIn addition to the expansion of philosophy of religion to take into\naccount a wider set of religions, the field has also seen an expansion\nin terms of methodology. Philosophers of religion have re-discovered\nmedieval philosophy\u2014the new translations and commentaries of\nmedieval Christian, Jewish, and Islamic texts have blossomed. There is\nnow a self-conscious, deliberate effort to combine work on the\nconcepts in religious belief alongside a critical understanding of\ntheir social and political roots (the work of Foucault has been\ninfluential on this point), feminist philosophy of religion has been\nespecially important in re-thinking what may be called the ethics of\nmethodology and, as this is in some respects the most current debate\nin the field, it is a fitting point to end this entry by highlighting\nthe work of Pamela Sue Anderson (1955\u20132017) and others.\n\nAnderson (1997 and 2012) seeks to question respects in which gender\nenters into traditional conceptions of God and in their moral and\npolitical repercussions. She also advances a concept of method which\ndelimits justice and human flourishing. A mark of legitimation of\nphilosophy should be the extent to which it contributes to human\nwelfare. In a sense, this is a venerable thesis in some ancient,\nspecifically Platonic philosophy that envisaged the goal and method of\nphilosophy in terms of virtue and the good. Feminist philosophy today\nis not exclusively a critical undertaking, critiquing\n\u201cpatriarchy\u201d. For a constructive, subtle treatment of\nreligious contemplation and practice, see Coakley 2002. Another key\nmovement that is developing has come to be called Continental\nPhilosophy of Religion. A major advocate of this new turn is John\nCaputo. This movement approaches the themes of this entry (the concept\nof God, pluralism, religious experience, metaphysics and epistemology)\nin light of Heidegger, Derrida, and other continental philosophers.\n(For a good representation of this movement, see Caputo 2001 and\nCrocket, Putt, & Robins 2014.)",
