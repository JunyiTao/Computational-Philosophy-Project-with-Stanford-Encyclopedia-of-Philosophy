    "main_text": "Features of Civil Disobedience || Civility\n1.2 Civility\n\nWhat makes an act of disobedience civil? Scholars commonly\nconsider all or some of the five features below to define civil\ndisobedience.\n1.2.1 Communication\n\nTypically, a person who commits an offense has no wish to communicate\nwith her government or society. This is evinced by the fact that\nusually such a person does not intend to make it known that she has\noffended. In contrast, civil disobedience is understood as a\ncommunicative act \u2013 a kind of symbolic speech, which aims to\nconvey a message to a certain audience, such as the government and\npublic. Civil disobedients are thought to contribute arguments to the\npublic sphere. Typically, their message is a call for reform or\nredress; and their audience is the majority. Civil disobedience is\nvariously described as an act by which \u201cone addresses the sense\nof justice of the majority of the community\u201d (Rawls 1999, 320),\nas \u201ca plea for reconsideration\u201d (Singer 1973,\n84\u201392), and as a \u201csymbolic\u2026 appeal to the capacity\nfor reason and sense of justice of the majority\u201d (Habermas 1985,\n99). Even when scholars expand the central criteria for civil\ndisobedience, they agree that civil disobedience is essentially\ncommunicative. In comparison, other types of principled disobedience\nare not necessarily communicative. For instance, animal rescue\nprimarily seeks to relieve the suffering of the rescued animals; the\ntactic of environmental sabotage known as \u2018tree-spiking\u2019\nprimarily seeks to prevent or stall the cutting down of trees (Delmas\n2018a, 44\u201345). Both types of action can of course be understood\nin terms of their messages, too, but communicating such a message is\nnot their primary aim in each case.\n1.2.2 Publicity\n\nOn many accounts, civil disobedience must be not only communicative,\nbut also public in a specific way. Publicity may designate\ndifferent features: (i) the openness of the act, (ii) non-anonymity of\nthe agent, (iii) advance warning of planned action, (iv)\nresponsibility-taking for the action, or (v) an appeal based in\npublicly shared principles of justice. The first four requirements may\nbe classified together under the umbrella of\npublicity-as-visibility, while the fifth can be dubbed\npublicity-as-appeal. Since the latter requirement matters\nmainly for the justification of civil disobedience, it is discussed\nbelow (\u00a73.2). That said, Rawls (1999, 321), for one, clarifies\nthe publicity of civil disobedience by describing it as a\n\u201cpolitical act,\u201d to wit, \u201can act guided and\njustified by political principles, that is, by the principles of\njustice which regulate the constitution and social institutions\ngenerally,\u201d thereby suggesting that publicity-as-appeal is in\nfact part of the definition of civil disobedience.\n\nRawls and Hugo Bedau (1961, 655), on whom Rawls relies, defend all of\nthe features of publicity-as-visibility, arguing that civil\ndisobedience could never be covert or secretive but could only ever be\ncommitted in public, openly, and with advance warning to authorities\n(per (i)\u2013(iii); and additionally that it involves\nresponsibility-taking (iv). The thought is that publicity is crucial\nto the civil disobedient\u2019s communicative aims and that any\nviolation of these features of publicity would obscure or muddy the\nnature of civil disobedience as a communicative act. Critics have\nrejected the requirement to give advance warning as a defining\ncriterion of civil disobedience. If a person publicizes her intention\nto breach the law, by giving advance notice about it, then she\nprovides legal authorities with the opportunity to abort her action\n(Dworkin 1985, 115; Smart 1991, 206\u20137). For instance,\nanti-nuclear activists who advertise their planned trespass on\nmilitary property would simply be prevented from executing their\naction. In this case, not giving advance warning is necessary to\naccomplish the communicative act.\n\nSome theorists have also denied the first two publicity requirements\nabove that civil disobedients need to act openly and non-anonymously.\nSome argue that publicity is compatible with covertness and anonymity,\nso long as agents claim responsibility for their actions after the\nfact (Greenawalt 1987, 239; Brownlee 2012, 160; Scheuerman 2018,\n43\u20135). For instance, Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks of classified\ninformation about the National Security Agency (NSA)\u2019s massive\nsurveillance programs constitute acts of civil disobedience in this\nview because, although Snowden obtained and leaked the documents\ncovertly, he eventually claimed responsibility and sought to publicly\njustify his actions (Scheuerman 2014, 617\u201321; Brownlee 2016,\n966). In this view, the only publicity requirement is (iv) that agents\ntake self-identifying responsibility for their actions after the fact.\nThe other requirements of publicity-as-visibility \u2013 openness,\nnon-anonymity, and advance warning \u2013 can in fact detract from or\nundermine the attempt to communicate through civil disobedience and\nare therefore not necessary to identify civil disobedience. Given,\nhowever, that there is often widespread reluctance to regard as\n\u201ccivil\u201d covert and anonymous acts of disobedience such as\nassistance to undocumented migrants or anonymous hacktivism, other\nthinkers accept (i), (ii), and (iv) as standard requirements of\npublicity-as-visibility and deem covert acts to be uncivil without\npre-judging their degree of justifiability (Delmas 2018a,\n44\u20135).\n1.2.3 Non-violence\n\nLike publicity, non-violence is supposed to be essential to the\ncommunicativeness of a civilly disobedient act, non-violence being\npart of its legibility as a mode of address. \u201cTo engage in\nviolent acts likely to injure and to hurt is incompatible with civil\ndisobedience as a mode of address. Indeed, any interference with the\ncivil liberties of others tends to obscure the civilly disobedient\nquality of one\u2019s act\u201d (Rawls 1999, 321). (The strategic\nand tactical value of non-violence is discussed in \u00a73.3.) Critics\nhave objected to the supposed incompatibility between violence and\ncommunication, arguing that violence, depending on its form and\ntargets, does not necessarily obscure the communicative quality of a\ndisobedient\u2019s act. Burning a police car or vandalizing a\nConfederate monument, as some protesters did under the Black Lives\nMatter banner, conveys a clear message of opposition to police\nbrutality and anger at the state\u2019s failure to address systemic\nracism. The compatibility between violence and communication is\nfurther underscored in cases of self-directed violence:\nself-immolation may provide \u201can eloquent statement of both the\ndissenter\u2019s frustration and the importance of the issues he\naddresses\u201d (Brownlee 2012, 21\u20132). On this basis, some\nscholars deny altogether the requirement that civil disobedience be\nnon-violent (M. Cohen 1970, 103; Brownlee 2012, 198\u20139; Moraro\n2019, 96\u2013101).\n\nSome scholars also see nothing inherently contradictory in the notion\nof \u201cviolent civil disobedience\u201d independent of its\ncommunicative aims. John Morreall views a person\u2019s physical\nassault on a slave owner chasing a runaway slave, in violation of the\nFugitive Slave Act of 1850, as a case of \u201cjustifiable violent\ncivil disobedience\u201d (1976, 42\u20133). Jennifer Welchman\nconsiders \u201cviolence, threats of violence, covert acts of\nsabotage, blackmail, and even assault\u201d as means that civil\ndisobedients can justifiably use to obstruct and frustrate injustice\n(2001, 105). But, arguably this route is too hasty, as it disregards\nwhat seems to be an essential and powerful association between civil\ndisobedience and non-violence: the civility of civil disobedience\nseems to entail non-violence. The difficulty is to specify the\nappropriate notions of violence and\nnon-violence.\n\nThis is a difficult task in part given its high political stakes:\nprotests labeled as non-violent are more likely to be perceived\nfavorably; protests labeled as violent are more likely to alienate the\npublic and to be met with violent repression. In addition, the\nlabeling of protests, as Robin Celikates notes, \u201cfar from being\na neutral observation, is always a politically charged speech act that\ncan reproduce forms of marginalization and exclusion that are often\nracialized and gendered\u201d and tends to serve the interests of\nsocially dominant or mainstream voices (2016, 983). On this basis,\nCelikates casts doubt on the usefulness of \u201ca fixed category of\nnon-violence \u2026 for a philosophical analysis of disobedience\ninformed by its social and political reality\u201d (ibid.).\nNonetheless, specifying the categories of violence and non-violence is\nimportant to push back against disingenuous uses of these categories,\nas when the police declare a peaceful protest a \u2018riot\u2019\n\u2013 a common occurrence in the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests\n(ACLED 2020).\n\nOne way to conceive of violence is as the use of physical\nforce causing or likely to cause injury (Rawls 1999, 321). However,\nnon-violent acts or even legal acts may indirectly yet foreseeably\ncause more harm to others than do direct acts of physical force. A\nlegal strike by ambulance workers or a roadblock on an important\nhighway may well have more severe consequences than minor acts of\nvandalism (Raz 1979, 267). Psychological violence can also cause\ninjury to others. Philosophers typically reject the childhood chant\nthat \u201csticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never\nhurt me,\u201d recognizing that harm and injury do not come solely\nfrom the use of physical force. For one thing, words can incite\nphysical violence. Words can also hurt even without the threat of\nphysical injury, such as verbal insult and harassment, which can\nundermine the recipient\u2019s sense of equal standing, self-worth,\nand safety. The implication for civil disobedience is that the\nrequirement of non-violence prohibits the use of tactics likely to\ninflict psychological violence on one\u2019s opponents. Aggressive\nconfrontations designed to denigrate and humiliate (distinct from\nattempts to elicit shame through displays of unearned suffering and\nappeals to conscience) are incompatible with the civility and\nnon-violence of civil disobedience.\n\nRawls does not mention, and it is unclear whether, non-violence\nprohibits certain actions that don\u2019t physically or\npsychologically injure others but still cause harms, such as property\ndamage (e.g., vandalism), violence to self (e.g., hunger strikes), and\ncoercion (e.g., forceful occupation).\n\nProperty damage: Authorities, much of the public, and many\nscholars tend to conceive of non-violence strictly, as excluding any\ndamage to property (Fortas 1968, 48\u20139, 123\u20136; Smith 2013,\n3, 33; Smith and Brownlee 2017, 5; Regan 2004). Two broad reasons may\nexplain the inclusion of property damage within the category of\nviolence. One is the classical liberal understanding of private\nproperty as an extension of one\u2019s person; the other is the\nassumption that property damage is likely to lead to violence against\npersons. John Locke formulates both when he argues it is \u201clawful\nfor a man to kill a thief, who has not in the least hurt him, nor\ndeclared any design upon his life \u2026 [because] I have no reason\nto suppose, that he, who would take away my liberty, would not, when\nhe had me in his power, take away every thing else\u201d (Locke 1690,\nIII \u00a718). By counting all instances of property destruction as\nviolent, such a view dissuades one from drawing evaluative\ndistinctions among different cases, methods, targets, and aims.\nHowever, not all property damage is or should be viewed as equal:\nburning one\u2019s Selective Service card to protest the military\ndraft is not equivalent to burning crosses to intimidate African\nAmericans and Jews; smashing a stained-glass window depicting enslaved\npersons in a cotton field (as a Yale janitor did in 2016) is not\nequivalent to smashing the windows of a store in order to loot it. For\nsome thinkers, such differences are not only issues of justification.\nThey insist that violence and non-violence simply do not exhaust the\ndescriptive possibilities and that we should think of property damage\nas a third conceptual category distinct from the other two and\nrequiring its own evaluative assessment (Sharp 2012a, 307; Delmas\n2018a, 49, 244\u20135). Other scholars have instead argued that\nnon-violence can encompass property damage (Milligan 2013, ch. 2;\nScheuerman 2018, 46\u20137, 77, 87). They hold that civil\ndisobedients can remain non-violent while engaging in selective\ndestruction of property, assuming the damage is minor and relates\nclearly to the civil disobedient\u2019s message, such as when\npacifists hammer warhead nose cones.\n\nSelf-violence: Self-violent protests include tactics such as\nlip-sewing, self-cutting, hunger strikes, self-exposure to the\nelements, and self-immolation. When theorists list hunger strikes\namong the tactics of civil disobedience, they often do not address the\nquestion of whether self-violence is compatible with non-violence\nproperly conceived, but simply assume an affirmative answer. Some\nscholars cast doubt on this notion, given the violence of\nself-destructive protests and given activists\u2019\nself-understanding of their own actions (see Bargu\u2019s 2014\ncritical ethnographic study on the 2000\u20132007 death fast by\nleft-wing militants in Turkish prisons). A notable exception to the\ntheoretical neglect of self-violence is Gandhi (1973, 103\u20135,\n120\u20135), who thought that hunger strikes were coercive and\nviolent but that fasts of moral pressure and Satyagrahic fasts were\npersuasive and non-violent (Sharp 2012a, 134, 151, 262); and likewise,\nthat self-immolation could accord with non-violence (ahimsa)\nand be fueled by satyagraha (\u2018Truth-force\u2019 in\nSanskrit) under the right circumstances (Gandhi 1999, 79.177; Milligan\n2014, 295\u20139).\n\nCoercion and persuasion: Theorists often complete the\ndichotomy between violence and non-violence by seeing violence as a\nmeans of coercion, non-violence as a means of persuasion, and the two\nas incompatible. Coercion can be defined as \u201cany interference by\nan agent, A, in the choices of another agent, B, with the aim of\ncompelling B to behave in a way that they would not otherwise\ndo\u201d (Aitchison 2018a, 668; see also entry on\n coercion).\n Persuasion, by contrast, requires initiating a dialogue with an\ninterlocutor and aiming to elicit a change of position or even their\nmoral conversion. Coercive tactics impose costs on opponents. For\ninstance, land occupation by environmental activists is designed to\nprevent or delay oil pipeline construction. Boycotts are also\nconsidered to be coercive tactics to the extent that they impose acute\ncosts on businesses (through lost revenue) and sometimes involve\nintimidation and the threat of force to ensure maximum compliance with\nthe boycott (Umoja 2013, 135\u201342). Some theorists of civil\ndisobedience hold that civil disobedients cannot resort to coercion;\nthey can only seek to persuade and appeal to their opponent\u2019s\nmoral conscience, which excludes confrontational and coercive tactics\n(Lefkowitz 2007, 216; Brownlee 2012, 24).\n\nPractitioners and other critics maintain that this dichotomy between\nnon-violent persuasion and violent coercion is false on the grounds\nthat there is such a thing as \u2018non-violent coercion\u2019,\nwhich is furthermore compatible with the goal of moral suasion.\nNon-violence appeals to the conscience of the public, by eliciting\nshame and indignation at the witnessing of civil disobedients\u2019\nsuffering and their discipline in the face of violent repression.\nAfter the 1955\u201356 Montgomery bus boycott, which unleashed\nspectacular white retaliatory violence, Martin Luther King, Jr., saw\nappeals to conscience as insufficient without disruption and\n\u201csome form of constructive coercive power\u201d (King 1968,\n137). \u201cNonviolent coercion always brings tension to the\nsurface\u201d, he wrote (ibid.), affirming \u201cthe coercive face\nof nonviolence\u201d along with its persuasive face (Livingston\n2020a, 704; see also Terry 2018, 305). \u201cThe purpose of our\ndirect action program,\u201d King proclaimed in his \u2018Letter\nfrom a Birmingham Jail\u2019, \u201cis to create a situation so\ncrisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to\nnegotiation\u201d (King 1991). Non-violent action is thus the means\nto the goal of both forcing negotiations \u2013 an essential\n\u201cmechanism for social change\u201d (Atack 2012, 139) \u2013\nand of persuading \u2013 its corresponding mechanism for moral and\ncultural change. This leaves open the question whether confrontational\nattacks that single out particular persons through harassment, doxing,\nand \u2018calling out\u2019 are compatible with non-violence. Such\nacts are coercive and, like verbal insults, they may be said to\ninflict psychological violence on the target.\n1.2.4 Non-evasion\n\nCivil disobedients are standardly expected to take responsibility for,\nand accept the legal consequences of, their lawbreaking. Their evading\npunishment would make their acts ordinary crimes or acts of rebellion;\ntheir willingness to invite punishment is supposed to demonstrate\ntheir endorsement of the legal system\u2019s legitimacy and their\n\u201cintense concern over the issue at hand\u201d (C. Cohen 1966,\n6; see also Brownlee 2012 ch. 1; Tai 2017, 146). Non-evasion is an\nessential correlate of the conscientiousness and non-violence of civil\ndisobedience: submitting to law enforcement is part of the dramatic\ndisplay of suffering required by non-violence. That said, theorists\nhave fleshed out this requirement of non-evasion in different ways,\narguing variously that the agent must (i) willingly submit to arrest\nand prosecution, (ii) plead guilty in court, (iii) not try to defend\nher crime, and/or (iv) not complain about the punishment received\n(Delmas 2019, arguing that only (i) is necessarily entailed by\nnon-evasion). Some theorists reject (ii) and (iii), proposing instead\nthat agents plead \u2018not guilty\u2019 in court, so as to deny the\nstate\u2019s characterization of the civil disobedient act as a\npublic wrong (in this view, disobedients should either deny\nresponsibility of having committed the action as alleged by the\nprosecutor or admit responsibility but deny criminal liability)\n(Moraro 2019, 143\u20137). Indeed, while the civil disobedient who\npleads \u2018guilty\u2019 and does not try to defend her\n\u2018crime\u2019 highlights her willingness to self-sacrifice, a\n\u2018not guilty\u2019 plea accompanied by a defense of her action\nmight be more effective at communicating her convictions and\npersuading others, including by inviting jury nullification. By\ncontrast, some thinkers reject (i) and (iv) on the grounds that when\ncivil disobedience is morally justified, the state\u2019s imposition\nof punishment is itself problematic and arguably impermissible, so\nthat further protests against civil disobedients\u2019 arrests,\nprosecutions, and sentences are justified (Zinn 2002, 27\u201331).\nCritics have also noted that punishment can be detrimental to\ndissenters\u2019 efforts by compromising future attempts to assist\nothers through protest (Greenawalt 1987, 239) and that willingness to\naccept punishment cannot be reasonably expected when agents know they\nrisk heavy fines or very long sentences for their actions (Scheuerman\n2018, 49\u201351).\n1.2.5 Decorum\n\nIn some views, being civil means that civil disobedients behave in a\ndignified and respectful manner by following the conventional social\nscripts that spell out displays of dignity and ways of showing respect\nin their society. Some theorists understand civility itself as respect\nfor \u201cminimal civil norms\u201d (Milligan 2013, ch. 2); others\ncount decorum as an additional, implicit requirement of civility in\nline with manifestations of self-restraint (Delmas in\n\u00c7\u0131dam, et al. 2020, 524\u20135). Decorum may be\nunderstood to prohibit conduct that would be seen as offensive,\ninsulting, or obscene (with the standards for each varying widely\nacross cultures). In Scheuerman\u2019s view, Gandhi and King, but not\nliberals and democrats, thought that politeness and decorum had a role\nto play (2018, 11\u201331). Yet one reason to think that decorum has\nseeped into the common understanding of civil disobedience is that it\nhelps to explain why some protests by Pussy Riot, ACT UP, and Black\nLives Matter, among others, which were conscientious, communicative,\npublic, non-violent, and non-evasive, were denied the label\ncivil: to wit, because protesters shouted down their\nopponents, expressed anger, used offensive language, or disrespected\nreligious sites (Delmas 2020, 18\u20139). Critics, however, deny that\ncivil disobedience needs to be decorous and push back against denials\nof civility, insofar as these are often deployed to silence activists\n(Harcourt 2012; Zerilli 2014). They deem expressions of anger and\noffensive or obscene displays to be compatible with civility\n(Scheuerman 2019, 5\u20137; \u00c7\u0131dam, et al. 2020,\n517\u20138) and insist on dissociating the politics of\n\u2018respectability\u2019 from civil disobedience (Pineda 2021a,\n161\u20133).\n1.3 Fidelity to Law\n\nWhat makes an act of civil disobedience special? On some accounts, an\nact that satisfies the criteria of civility identified above,\nespecially non-evasion, signals disobedients\u2019 respect for and\nfidelity to the legal system in which they carry out their protest, in\ncontrast with ordinary offenders and revolutionary agents (Rawls 1999,\n322). Signaling one\u2019s fidelity to law by abiding the demands of\ncivility is seen as necessary to thwart fears of disorder or counter\nthe impression that civil disobedients are contemptuous of democratic\nprocedures. Critics point out that agents do not necessarily respect,\nnor have any reasons to respect, the legal system in which they carry\nout their civil disobedience (Lyons 1998, 33\u20136). It is thus\nuseful to distinguish the outward features of the civilly disobedient\nact from the inward attitudes of the civilly disobedient agent.\n\nMany thinkers argue that the link between the disobedient act\u2019s\ncivility and her fidelity to law or endorsement of the legal system\ncan indeed be pulled apart. For one thing, agents intent on\noverthrowing their government may well resort to civil tactics simply\nbecause civil disobedience works (Sharp 2012b). Some theorists\nnonetheless hold on to the connection between civility and fidelity to\nlaw. For instance, some discard some of the requirements of civility\nbut maintain that the civilly disobedient agent can still be motivated\nby respect for law and act within the limits of fidelity to law while\ndisobeying covertly, evading punishment, damaging property, or\noffending the public (Brownlee 2012, 24\u20139; Scheuerman 2018,\n49\u201353; Moraro 2019, 96\u2013101). Others hold that it is\nworthwhile to maintain the link between the act\u2019s civility and\nits conveying fidelity to law, whether or not agents actually endorse\nthe system\u2019s legitimacy, insofar as its self-restraint holds the\nkey to civil disobedience\u2019s place in democratic culture (Smith\n2013, 32\u20135; Delmas 2019, 173\u20134).\n\nOther theorists deny that civil disobedients need to demonstrate\nfidelity to law, taking what Scheuerman (2015) dubs an anti-legal\nturn. Civility, on a number of recent accounts (Brownlee 2012 ch.\n1; Moraro 2019, ch. 2; M. Cooke 2021), is satisfied when agents aim to\ncommunicate with an audience and engage with the public sphere. On a\nradical understanding, the civility of civil disobedience is\ncompatible with tactics \u201cthat will be regarded as uncivil\nbecause of their confrontational or even violent character, including\nmassive disruption, the destruction of property, and the use of\nrestrained force in self-defense,\u201d only excluding para-military\nconfrontation (Celikates 2021, 143).\n\nThis anti-legal turn goes along with what we may call a critical\nturn in scholarship on civil disobedience. Not only do theorists\ncritique the liberal account of civil disobedience as unduly narrow\nand restrictive (as contemporary critics of Rawls already did) and\narticulate a more inclusive concept; but they also critique the\nideology that undergirds the common account, uncovering the ways in\nwhich it distorts the reality of the practice, deters resistance, and\nbuttresses the status quo (Celikates 2014, 2016; Delmas 2018a, ch. 1;\nPineda 2021b, ch. 1). In this vein, several scholars have reassessed\nthe complex legacy of Thoreau and Gandhi to the civil disobedience\ntradition, in order to both show the misappropriation of their\nwritings on political resistance and to call for a reappropriation and\nappreciation of their visions (Mantena 2012; Hanson 2021; Livingston\n2018; Scheuerman 2018, ch. 1, 4). Scholars have also reconsidered the\nhistorical record of the American Civil Rights Movement to excavate\nthe radical understanding of civil disobedience forged by actors\nthemselves, in lieu of the romantic and sanitized version that\ndominates public perception of the Movement (Hooker 2016; Livingston\n2020a, 2020b; Pineda 2021b, ch. 2\u20135; Mantena 2018; and Shelby\nand Terry 2018). Setting the record straight matters not just for\nhistorical accuracy but also because the Civil Rights Movement is used\nas the benchmark to judge contemporary protest movements such as Black\nLives Matter, unfavorably comparing today\u2019s activists with an\nidealized standard with the effect of prejudicing the public against\nthem.\n2. Other Types of Protest\n\nAlthough civil disobedience often overlaps broadly with other types of\ndissent, nevertheless some distinctions may be drawn between the key\nfeatures of civil disobedience and the key features of these other\npractices.\n2.1 Legal Protest\n\nThe obvious difference between legal protest and civil disobedience is\nthat the former lies within the bounds of the law, but the latter does\nnot. Legal ways of protesting include, among many others, making\nspeeches, signing petitions, organizing for a cause, donating money,\ntaking part in authorized demonstrations, and boycotting. Some of\nthese can become illegal, for instance when law enforcement declares\nan assembly unlawful and orders the crowd to disperse, or under\nanti-boycott legislation. Some causes may also be declared illegal,\nsuch that one cannot be associated with the cause or donate to it\n(such as the Communist Party in the U.S.). Most of the features\nexemplified in civil disobedience \u2013 other than its illegality\n\u2013 can be found in legal protest: a conscientious and\ncommunicative demonstration of protest, a desire to bring about\nthrough moral dialogue some lasting change in policy or principle, an\nattempt to educate and to raise awareness, and so on.\n2.2 Rule Departures\n\nA practice distinct from, but related to, civil disobedience is rule\ndeparture on the part of authorities. Rule departure is essentially\nthe deliberate decision by an official, for conscientious reasons, not\nto discharge the duties of her office (Feinberg 1992, 152). If an\nofficial\u2019s breach of a specific duty is more in keeping with the\nspirit and overall aims of the office than a painstaking respect for\nits particular duties is, then the former might be said to adhere\nbetter than the latter does to the demands of the office (Greenawalt\n1987, 281). Rule departures resemble civil disobedience in that both\ncommunicate the agent\u2019s dissociation from and condemnation of\ncertain policies and practices. Civil disobedience and rule departure\ndiffer mainly in the identity of their practitioners and in their\nlegality. First, whereas rule departure typically is done by an agent\nof the state (including citizens serving in juries), civil\ndisobedience typically is done by citizens (including officials acting\nas ordinary citizens and not in the capacity of their official role).\nSecond, whereas the civil disobedient breaks the law, the official who\ndeparts from the rules associated with her role is not usually\nviolating the law, unless the rule she breaks is also codified in law.\nFor instance, jurors may refuse to convict a person for violating an\nunjust law. When they do, they nullify the law. However, many judges\nforbid any mention of jury nullification in their courtroom, so that\njurors are not allowed to advise each other of the possibility to\nrefuse to convict (Brooks 2004).\n2.3 Conscientious Objection\n\nConscientious objection may be defined as a refusal to conform to some\nrule, mandate, or legal directive on grounds of personal opposition to\nit. Examples include conscripts refusing to serve in the army; public\nofficials refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses; and parents\nrefusing to vaccinate their children as mandated by state law. Public\nofficials\u2019 conscientious objection is indistinguishable from\nrule departures insofar as the agent refuses to discharge the set of\nduties associated with her official role. Conscientious\nobjectors\u2019 non-conformity may stem from very different kinds of\nmotives: the conscript\u2019s religious pacifism or moral and\npolitical opposition to a particular war or military occupation, for\ninstance, has little in common with anti-vaxxers\u2019\npseudo-scientific beliefs. But, in many views, conscientious objection\nis conscientious in the sense identified above, that is to say,\nsincere, serious, and reflecting the depth of the person\u2019s\nconviction. In other views, however, when an objector seeks to keep\nher act private and to avoid detection, this casts doubt on her\nsincerity and seriousness (Brownlee 2012, ch. 1). As an objection,\nconscientious objection also shares with civil disobedience the\nagent\u2019s opposition to the law, since the conscientious objector\nrefuses to conform with the law because she considers it bad or wrong,\ntotally or in part, and thus seeks to disassociate herself from\nit.\n\nConscientious objection is often considered to be the private\ncounterpart of civil disobedience: where civil disobedients address\nthe public, are motivated by and appeal to general considerations of\njustice, and seek to bring about reform, conscientious objectors are\nsupposed to be animated by personal convictions and to simply seek to\npreserve their own moral integrity through exemption (Smith and\nBrownlee 2017). For instance, consider that the refusal of\nJehovah\u2019s Witnesses to salute the flag is a matter of private\nreligious morality; they do not seek to abolish the practice of\nsaluting the flag for all citizens. Their example is instructive in\nanother way: Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 refusal is legally\nprotected. Conscientious objection, unlike civil disobedience, is not\nnecessarily unlawful. Indeed, the law protects conscientious objectors\nin many contexts, including in the military and healthcare, by carving\nout exemptions for them.\n\nSome thinkers distinguish conscientious objection from conscientious\nevasion and stress that we should not overstate the private and\npersonal characteristics of the former. Conscientious objectors often\nact openly and non-anonymously and take responsibility for their\nnon-conforming act by attempting or being willing to justify it to\nauthorities. To that extent, they may be said to meet the\npublicity-as-visibility requirement. Some agents, in contrast,\nundertake their conscientious objection covertly and evasively as\nconscientious evasion. A young man drafted to fight a war he opposes,\nfor instance, may openly refuse to serve and be arrested and charged\nfor his refusal, or covertly dodge the draft by going AWOL. While\nconscientious evasion is incompatible with the intention to\ncommunicate, conscientious objection may have a public or\ncommunicative component, as Thoreau clearly did with his conscientious\ntax refusal, in a way that blurs the distinction with civil\ndisobedience. Moreover, when such actions are taken by many people\n\u2013 as they often are \u2013 their collective impact can\napproximate the kind of communicative protest exemplified in civil\ndisobedience (Delmas 2018a, ch. 7). In this vein, Emanuela Ceva (2015)\nhighlights the public and political character of conscientious\nobjection (what we call publicity-as-appeal above), which she\nconceives of as \u2018a form of political participation\u2019.\n2.4 Immigration Disobedience\n\nWritings on immigration and on civil disobedience have merged into an\narea of research devoted to principled disobedience in response to\nanti-immigration policies. One view, which focuses on what individual\nactors should do about immigration, examines various unlawful tactics\nof resistance, including evasion, deception, use of force against\nstate officials, and smuggling (Hidalgo 2019, chs. 5\u20136). Another\nview conceives of illegal migration as a form of resistance to global\npoverty (Blunt 2019, ch. 4), while a third sees unauthorized border\ncrossing as a type of conscientious evasion (Cabrera 2010,\n136\u201343, 165). It is further useful to distinguish transnational\ncivil disobedience from global civil disobedience.\nTransnational (or trans-state) civil disobedience is the\nprincipled violation of a state\u2019s law or policy (a) by\nindividuals who are not citizens or authorized permanent residents of\nthat state, such as asylum-seekers marching from Hungary to Austria\nagainst E.U. regulations; or (b) by the state\u2019s own citizens on\nbehalf of outsiders, such as U.S. citizens active in the Sanctuary\nmovement who provided illegal assistance to asylum-seekers from\nCentral America in the 1980s. Both kinds of cases involve at root the\n\u201cprincipled claim\u2026 that the state\u2019s law is\nmisaligned with the foundational moral principles of the current\nglobal system\u201d (Cabrera 2021, 322). Acts of global\ncivil disobedience, on this view, involve \u201cclaims implicating\nstructural principles of the global system itself, as misaligned with\nits foundational moral principles\u201d (Cabrera ibid.). For\ninstance, when the sans-papiers in France openly protest\nagainst their socio-political and legal exclusion through occupations,\ndemonstrations, and hunger strikes, they may be viewed as engaged in\nacts of global civil disobedience. One last useful category of\nprincipled disobedience that relates to immigration restrictions,\nalthough it overlaps with rule departures and conscientious objection,\nis official or local disobedience, as when local\nauthorities declare themselves \u2018Sanctuary cities\u2019 to\nprotect immigrants by refusing to cooperate with federal authorities\n(Blake and Hereth 2020, 468\u201371. See also Applbaum 1999, ch. 9 on\n\u2018official disobedience\u2019 and Scheuerman 2020 on\n\u2018state-based\u2019 or \u2018political institutional civil\ndisobedience\u2019).\n2.5 Digital disobedience\n\nDigitalization \u2013 access to personal computers and the Internet\n\u2013 has transformed not only our lives and interactions, but also\nour disobedient practices. From piracy to DDoS attacks and from\nopen-access coding to Digital Care Packages (which provide tools to\ncircumvent censorship and surveillance), digital disobedience has\nemerged as a rich terrain for theoretical inquiry. Scholars disagree\nabout the application of the defining features of civil disobedience\nto the digital, e.g., whether client-sided DDoS actions, which involve\nonly voluntary botnets, amount to \u201cvirtual sit-ins\u201d;\nwhether hacktivists such as Anonymous may be considered civil\ndisobedients despite their covert and evasive actions, their penchant\nfor pranks, and their singling out of particular individuals for\ndoxing and retaliation (such as in Operation Hunt Hunter which\ntargeted \u2018revenge porn\u2019 magnate Hunter Moore); or whether\nthe use of zombie botnets in DDoS attacks and the cost of updating\nsecurity systems for the target evinces the violation of non-violence\n(see, e.g., Critical Art Ensemble 1998; Himma 2006; Scheuerman 2018,\nch. 6; Celikates 2015, 2016; Sauter 2016; Delmas 2018b; Z\u00fcger\n2021).\n\nThese debates aside, it is useful to distinguish different kinds of\ndigital tools, sites, strategies, and aims. First, activists use\ndigital technology as tools to organize, document, communicate, raise\nfunds, and make decisions. For instance, Black Lives Matter activists\nuse social media to promote their cause, raise consciousness about\nsystemic racism, and publicize instances of police brutality. They use\ncrowdfunding platforms for fundraising to cover bail and other legal\nexpenses for those arrested. They encourage people to use police\nscanner apps to watch police activity and legal assistance apps to\nrecord encounters with law enforcement officials. Second, the digital\nis itself a crucial site and object of activism. Hacktivists envision\na different Internet \u2013 one that is democratic and democratically\ncontrolled, free, respectful of privacy, and creative. They protest\nagainst the digital architecture of surveillance and control that has\nbeen imposed on netizens without their consent. For instance, a number\nof websites, search engines, and online communities launched\ncoordinated actions in 2012 to protest against the Stop Online Piracy\nAct (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA), whose overbroad scope they\nsaw as threats to online freedom of speech. Third, some properly\ndigital strategies of principled disobedience have emerged, such as\nDDoS actions, web defacement, and hacking. For instance, the No Border\nnetwork created a fake Lufthansa website touting its\n\u201cDeportation Class service \u2026 the most economic way to\ntravel the world\u201d (\u201cspecial restrictions apply \u2026 no\nround trips available\u201d). The Open Access Movement, which\nadvocates for open-source software and an open-source repository of\nacademic and scientific research, combines all three dimensions of\ndigital disobedience: it uses networked computers to organize and\ncommunicate; it seeks to bring about a free Internet characterized by\nthe free flow of software, science, and culture and has developed a\ncoherent political platform in its defense; and it deploys properly\ndigital strategies, such as illegal downloads and peer-to-peer file\nsharing (which is illegal when the content torrented is copyrighted\nmaterial). The Open Access Movement epitomizes a public,\ngeeks-and-grassroots mass movement that not only promotes online\ndemocratic governance, but also enacts it within the movement (Swartz 2008\n[Other Internet Resources]; Delmas 2018b, 79\u201380).\n2.6 Uncivil disobedience\n\nUncivil disobedience is not a distinct category of political\naction, but a cluster concept or umbrella term that can be used to\ndesignate acts of principled disobedience that may or may not be\ncommunicative, and which violate one or more of the marks of civility\nby being covert, violent, evasive, or offensive (Delmas 2018a, 2020;\nLai 2019). Examples include animal rescue, Sanctuary assistance,\nsabotage, ecotage (e.g., monkeywrenching and tree-spiking), graffiti,\nleaks, government whistleblowing, hacktivism (including DDoS attacks),\nguerrilla protests, and riots. These various act-types do not share\nany essential property, besides violating one or more of the commonly\naccepted criteria of civility. Each form of uncivil disobedience must\nbe examined (conceptualized and assessed) on its own. By\nconceptualizing uncivil disobedience, scholars intend to counter the\ntheoretical impetus to make the concept of civil disobedience ever\nbroader to encompass protests that one approves of, but which do not\nfit the standard account and may not even fit activists\u2019\nself-understanding either. For instance, in her 1913 speech\n\u201cFreedom or Death\u201d, the suffragist Emmeline Pankhurst\ndescribed herself as a \u201csoldier\u201d in a \u201ccivil\nwar\u201d waged against the state and defended the use of militant\ntactics, including heckling, window-smashing, sabotage, arson, and\nhunger strikes: radical defiance was the point of such uncivil\ntactics. Identifying some principled disobedient acts as uncivil makes\nroom to focus on their justification. Scholars have defended such\nuncivil disobedience as political rioting (Pasternak 2019), vandalism\n(Lim 2020; Lai 2020), violent protest (Kling and Mitchell 2019),\ncoercive strike tactics (Gourevitch 2018), and direct action (Smith\n2018).\n2.7 Revolutionary Action\n\nWhile a civil disobedient does not necessarily oppose the regime in\nwhich she acts, the revolutionary agent is deeply opposed to that\nregime (or a core aspect of that regime). Revolutionary agents may not\nseek to persuade others of the merits of their position \u2013\ncommunication is usually not their primary aim, although they convey\nthe urgency of a regime change. When revolution is called for, such as\nunder colonial occupation, there is no need to justify constrained\nacts of protest like civil disobedience. Indeed, more forceful\nresistance can be justified as we pass into the realm of just war\ntheory (Buchanan 2013; Finlay 2015). This is not to say that all\nviolent tactics, including terror, are permissible, since the use of\nviolence must not only pursue a just cause but also accord with\nproportionality and necessity (i.e., be undertaken in last resort and\nwith a reasonable chance of success). As will be discussed in the next\nsection, revolutionary activists and thinkers like Frantz Fanon (2004,\nch. 1) and Gandhi disagreed about the effectiveness of violence in\nemancipatory struggles, but not about its justifiability, as Karuna\nMantena (2018, 83\u20134) has shown.\n3. Justification\n\nThe task of defending civil disobedience is commonly undertaken with\nthe assumption that in reasonably just, liberal societies people have\na general moral duty to follow the law (often called political\nobligation). It is on the basis of such an assumption that civil\ndisobedience requires justification. This section examines common\nunderstandings of the problem of disobedience (3.1), before presenting\nprominent accounts and critiques of the conditions under which civil\ndisobedience may be justified (3.2). Whether or not theorists assume\nthat civil disobedience is presumptively impermissible and in need of\njustification, their analyses also articulate the value and role of\ncivil disobedience in non-ideal, nearly just or less-than-nearly-just\nliberal democracies (3.3).\n3.1 The Problem of Disobedience\n\nPhilosophers have given many arguments in favor of the moral duty to\nobey the law (see entry on\n political obligation).\n Despite the many critiques of, and general skepticism toward,\narguments for the moral duty to obey the law, most prominently\nfollowing A. John Simmons (1979), theorists of civil disobedience have\ncontinued to conceive of the practice\u2019s illegality as a hurdle\nto surmount (see Lyons 1998 for an analysis of the endurance of such a\nproblematic assumption). They conceive of principled disobedience in\ngeneral as presumptively wrong because it violates political\nobligation, undermines the rule of law, and destabilizes society both\nthrough example, by signaling to others that anyone can disobey if\nthey feel the urge, and in principle, by expressing disrespect for\nlaw\u2019s authority. They contend that civil disobedience in\nparticular is presumptively wrong because of its anti-democratic\nnature. The agent who violates the outcomes of democratic\ndecision-making processes because she disapproves of them puts herself\nabove the law and threatens the legal and democratic order. Some see\nin it a violation of reciprocity, a kind of political\n\u201cblackmail\u201d and a sign of \u201cmoral\nself-indulgence\u201d and arrogance, insofar as a minority, whose\nviews didn\u2019t prevail, disregards democratic processes and\nimposes on the majority its own view of the good and just (C. Cohen\n1971, 138\u201345; Dworkin 1985, 112; Weinstock 2016, 709; for a\nresponse to the charge of \u2018epistemic arrogance\u2019, see\nHindkj\u00e6r Madsen 2021).\n\nRecent scholarship on civil disobedience has taken what may be dubbed\nan anarchist turn, as theorists tend to no longer approach\ncivil disobedience as presumptively wrong and in tension with\npolitical obligation. Although some theorists still defend the latter\n(Smith 2013), most start from skepticism vis-\u00e0-vis the moral\nduty to obey the law (Brownlee 2012; Celikates 2014, 2016). Others\ndefend a disjunctive moral duty to obey the law or disobey it civilly\n(Lefkowitz 2007); and still others argue that the grounds commonly\nused to support political obligation \u2013 the natural duty of\njustice, the principle of fairness, the Samaritan duty, and\nassociative obligations \u2013 yield duties to resist injustice,\nthrough civil and uncivil disobedience, under non-ideal circumstances,\nand that such duties should be considered among our political\nobligations (Delmas 2018a). Likewise, on a virtue-ethical account,\npolitical obligation can be understood as an obligation to respect\nrather than to obey the law, which can sometimes give rise to a duty\nto engage in civil disobedience (Moraro 2019, ch. 6).\n3.2 Justificatory Conditions\n\nGiven the assumption that people have a moral duty to obey the law and\nthe concern that civil disobedience has the potential to destabilize\nsociety, Rawls famously raised the bar for the justified use of the\npractice, requiring acts of civil disobedience 1) to target serious\nand long-standing injustice and at the same time appeal to widely\naccepted principles of justice, 2) to be undertaken as a last resort,\nand 3) to be done in coordination with other minority groups with\nsimilar grievances (Rawls 1999, 326\u20139). These conditions for the\njustification of civil disobedience, which are critically examined in\nthis part, are closely tied not only to the ostensible need to diffuse\nits destabilizing potential and discourage proliferation of the\npractice, but also to the efficacy and role of civil disobedience in\nsociety (which is explored further in 3.3).\n\nLongstanding Injustice: Why did Rawls restrict the target of\ncivil disobedience to entrenched, longstanding injustices \u2013 in\nparticular, violations of the principle of equal basic liberties? For\nRawls, civil disobedience\u2019s chance of success rests on the\nclarity of the injustice: everyone must be able to recognize the\nviolation as an injustice, given widely accepted principles of\npolitical morality. Racial segregation fell in this category,\naccording to Rawls, but not economic inequality. Rawls thinks that\nappeals to publicly shared principles of constitutional morality (per\nthe publicity-as-appeal requirement) are more likely to persuade the\nmajority and succeed to bring about reform. Rawls, Ju\u0308rgen\nHabermas, and Ronald Dworkin restrict both civil disobedients\u2019\nappeals and their possible targets: they exclude matters of policy, as\nwell as injustices that do not consist of incontrovertible violations\nof widely accepted principles of justice.\n\nCritics reject this justificatory condition because it arbitrarily\nexcludes both progressive but not widely shared conceptions of justice\n(such as cosmopolitanism) and appeals to other principles of morality\nbesides justice (say, regarding the ethical treatment of animals;\nSinger 1973, 86\u201392). And whereas Dworkin (1985, 111\u20132)\nfinds anti-nuclear protest unjustifiable to the extent that it turns\non judgments of policy instead of appealing to fundamental principles\nof political morality, Robert Goodin (1987) counters that the\njustice/policy distinction is flimsy and arbitrarily drawn and insists\nthat civil disobedients should pursue the common good by protesting\ninternational and climate policies. Scholars also include in the class\nof justifiable targets private agents such as trade unions, banks,\nhealth insurance companies, labs, farm factories, and private\nuniversities (Walzer 1982, ch.2; Smith 2013, 55\u20136; Milligan\n2013, ch. 11\u201312; S. Cooke 2016). Finally, observation of past\nand present social movements, including the Abolitionist movement,\n#MeToo, and Black Lives Matter, suggests that, rather than appealing\nto the public principles of political morality, civil disobedients may\nin fact seek to transform common sense morality.\n\nLast Resort: What grounds the widely accepted requirement\nthat civil disobedience be undertaken as a last resort? How do we know\nagents have met it? One position is that, in a liberal democracy,\ncitizens should use proper legal channels of political participation\nto express their grievances (Raz 1979; though Raz grants that\nindividual acts of disobedience can be justified in liberal regimes).\nBut, since causes defended by a minority are often those most opposed\nby persons in power, legal channels may be less than wholly effective\n(Rawls 1999, 327). Moreover, it is unclear when a person could claim\nto have reached a situation of last resort; she could continue to use\nthe same tired legal methods without end. To ward off such challenges,\nRawls suggests that, if past actions, including by others, have shown\nthe majority to be immovable or apathetic, then further attempts may\nreasonably be thought fruitless and the dissenter may be confident her\ncivil disobedience is a last resort (1999, 328).\n\nMinority Group Coordination: The coordination requirement is\ndesigned to regulate the overall level of dissent (Rawls 1999, 327).\nThe idea is that since minority groups are equally justified in\nresorting to civil disobedience when they have sufficiently weighty\nobjections, these groups should avoid undermining each other\u2019s\nefforts through simultaneous appeals to the attention of society and\ngovernment. While there is some merit to this condition, arguably\ncivil disobedience that does not meet it can still be justifiable. In\nsome cases, there will be no time or opportunity to coordinate with\nother minorities. In other cases, other minority groups may be unable\nor unwilling to coordinate. The refusal or inability of other groups\nto cooperate should arguably not affect the ultimate defensibility of\na person\u2019s or group\u2019s use of civil disobedience.\n\nA reason for Rawls to defend this coordination requirement is that\noften coordination serves a more important concern, namely, the\nachievement of good consequences. It is often argued that civil\ndisobedience can only be justified if there is a high probability that\nit will produce positive change, since only such change can justify\nexposing society to the risks of harm usually associated with civil\ndisobedience \u2013 namely, its destabilizing and divisive potential\nand the risk that it could encourage lawbreaking or escalate into\nuncivil disobedience. In response to these challenges, one might\nquestion the empirical claims that civil disobedience is divisive and\nthat it has the consequence of leading others to use disobedience to\nachieve changes in policy. One might also question whether it\nnecessarily would be a bad thing if civil disobedience had these\nconsequences. Concerning likelihood of success, civil disobedience can\nseem most justifiable when the situation appears hopeless and when the\ngovernment refuses to listen to conventional forms of communication.\nAdditionally, even when general success seems unlikely, civil\ndisobedience might be defended for any reprieve from harm that it\nbrings to victims of a bad law or policy. Tree-hugging, for example,\ncan delay or curtail a clear-cut logging scheme and thereby prolong\nthe protection of an ecosystem.\n3.3 Value\n\nThe justification of civil disobedience further articulates the\nconditions for its effective role in society. Far from undermining the\nrule of law or destabilizing society, civil disobedience could\nstrengthen the social and legal order. Civil disobedience can have a\njustice-enhancing value: it can serve \u201cto inhibit departures\nfrom justice and to correct them when they occur\u201d (Rawls 1999,\n336). Equally, it can have a legitimacy-enhancing function, with some\nthinkers conceiving of civil disobedience as \u2018the guardian of\nlegitimacy\u2019 (Habermas 1985, 103). Both ideas deem the practice\nof civil disobedience to be a valuable component of the public\npolitical culture of a near-just constitutional democratic society.\nHabermas even took the state\u2019s treatment of civil disobedience\nas a \u2018litmus test\u2019 for the maturity of the political\nculture of a constitutional democracy: \u201cEvery constitutional\ndemocracy that is sure of itself considers civil disobedience as a\nnormalized \u2013 because necessary \u2013 component of its\npolitical culture\u201d (Habermas 1985, 99).\n\nWhile Habermas\u2019s account resembles Rawls\u2019s liberal\napproach in many ways, its distinctive deliberative strand has also\ninfluenced democracy-based accounts, which defend the justification\nand role of civil disobedience on the basis of its contribution to\ndemocracy. Deliberative democrats (Markovits 2005; Smith 2013, ch.\n1\u20133), republican democrats (Arendt 1972), and radical democrats\n(Celikates 2014, 2016) focus on the potential of civil disobedience to\nenhance democratic legitimacy and to constitute in itself a form of\ndemocratic empowerment. Agents engaged in civil disobedience can\nenhance democratic legitimacy in a number of ways, including by\nputting a heretofore-neglected issue on the political agenda and\nraising awareness about its stakes; contributing to and informing\ndemocratic deliberation; highlighting the outsize influence of\npowerful players and the exclusionary effects of certain processes of\npublic deliberation, and working to make the latter more inclusive.\nCivil disobedience does not only aim to invigorate democratic\nsovereignty, but also can constitute a form of democratic empowerment\nin itself \u2013 an exercise of political agency that is especially\nmeaningful for marginalized groups. Through civil disobedience,\nindividuals discover and realize their power. They work together and\nforge bonds of solidarity. They engage in democratic politics.\nTheorists\u2019 examples to illustrate democratic civil disobedience\ninclude: the Occupy Movement, pro-democracy movements around the\nworld, anti-globalization and anti-austerity protests, climate justice\nactivism, and Campesino movements for land redistribution and agrarian\nreform. Many activists further enact within their movement the norms\nand values that guide their struggles, for instance through radical\ninclusion, direct democratic decision-making, aspiration to consensus,\nand leaderless organizational structures. Some theorists insist on the\nneed to align the means of protest with its aims, by deploying only\npersuasive, non-violent forms of protest that reflect democratic\nideals (Habermas 1997, 383\u20134; M. Cooke 2016), while others\ncontend that civil disobedience can be confrontational and coercive\nwithout betraying its democratic aims (Smith 2021; Fung 2005,\n409).\n\nA third approach to the value of civil disobedience, besides the\nliberal and democratic lenses, comes from the political realist\nperspective. Robert Jubb (2019) critiques Rawlsian accounts of civil\ndisobedience for the binary theory of political authority they rest\non: they take the whole political order to be either legitimate or\nillegitimate, and thereby ignore or deny the possibility that a regime\nmay be authoritative in virtue of having a democratic mandate, yet\nfail to protect everyone\u2019s basic liberties or to treat all its\nmembers as equals, for example. Jubb proposes instead to\n\u201cdisaggregate\u201d political authority, that is, to\ndistinguish between the different forms of authority which a political\norder may possess or lack, in order to make sense of the conditions\nunder which different forms of protest and resistance may be\nappropriate. Other realists criticize both liberal and deliberative\ndemocratic perspectives for their deductive, top-down approach to\nmoral analysis, their quest for rational consensus, and their\nassumption that people can be persuaded by rational arguments alone\n(Sabl 2001, 2021; Mantena 2012). Realist accounts of civil\ndisobedience stress instead \u201cthe ubiquity of moral disagreement\nand the permanence of political conflict\u201d (Sabl 2021, 153).\nAndrew Sabl, for instance, envisions civil disobedience as a properly\n\u2018political technology\u2019 (2021, 165), situated between\nsubmission and revolution, through which agents seek to effect change\nin the basic allocation of burdens and benefits by raising costs for\nadversaries, but without undermining the state\u2019s basic functions\nsuch as its provision of public goods.\n\nFor her part, Mantena debunks the common understanding of Gandhi and\nKing as committed in principle and absolutely to non-violence, showing\nthat their endorsement of non-violence reflected concerns of political\nefficacy. They considered political violence to be\n\u201cfutile\u201d, that is, ineffective for social change and\nlikely to bring about \u201cdangerous and perverse consequences in\npolitics\u201d (Mantena 2018, 84). In Gandhi\u2019s view, violence\nwould cultivate the wrong kind of independence for India and breed the\nwrong kind of polity, amounting to a mere change of personnel in a\nviolent state and generating unstable conditions. Mantena identifies\n\u201cthree faces of nonviolent action\u201d, which we can reframe\nas realists\u2019 account of the triple value of civil disobedience:\n1) morally, civil disobedience is the right means by which oppressed\npeople can regain dignity and self-respect; 2) strategically, it is a\nnecessary means to just and stable political results and future\ndemocratic concord; and 3) tactically, the dramatization of civil\ndisobedients\u2019 discipline works effectively to persuade\nopponents. Recent social scientific research has corroborated the\neffectiveness of non-violence in campaigns of civil resistance, which\nseek to topple dictatorships or colonial powers (Chenoweth and Stephan\n2011; Schock 2015).\n\nMany democratic theorists incorporate political realism in their\napproach as they strive to think about and \u201clearn from the\nstreets\u201d (Celikates 2014), in a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach\ndesigned to understand particular contemporary protest movements. This\napproach constitutes a stark departure from \u201ctop-down\u201d\nliberal approaches like Rawls\u2019s and Dworkin\u2019s that require\nagents justify their disobedient protest before engaging in it. As\nAlexander Livingston puts it, many democratic and critical theorists\ntoday seek to draw \u201ctheoretical insights from protest movements\nthemselves around the globe rather than legislating moral guidelines\nfor activist praxis from the sidelines\u201d (\u00c7\u0131dam et al\n2020, 540). Guy Aitchison sees this as a central feature of the\n\u2018new civil disobedience debate\u2019, in which scholars seek to\nrespond to \u2018a new era of political protest and unrest\u2019\ncharacterized by \u201cthe proliferation and intensification of\noppositional political action by groups challenging economic\ninequality, racist policing, immigration enforcement, austerity, war,\nclimate change, financial oligarchy, privatization, and corporate\ndomination of cyberspace\u201d (Aitchison 2018b, 5, 7\u20138)\n\u2013 which theorists tend to be in broad sympathy with. Such\nbottom-up approach also diverges from David Lefkowitz\u2019s and\nKimberley Brownlee\u2019s defenses of a moral right to civil\ndisobedience that applies impartially to all acts of civil\ndisobedience, justified or not (see 4.2).\n4. Responding to Civil Disobedience\n\nHow should the state respond to civil disobedience? The question of\nappropriate legal response applies, first, to the actions of\nlaw-enforcers when deciding whether and how to intervene in a civilly\ndisobedient action. It applies, second, to the actions of prosecutors\nwhen deciding whether to file charges and proceed to trial. Finally,\nit applies to the actions of judges (and juries) when deciding whether\nto convict and (for judges) how much to punish. All three contexts of\nlegal sanctions beg the question of criminal law\u2019s function.\n4.1 Punishing Civil Disobedience\n\nHow much punishment is appropriate for civil disobedients? Is\npunishment appropriate at all? If there is a right to civil\ndisobedience, then, as we saw, it protects people from punishment.\nEven if there isn\u2019t, is punishment indefensible if it sanctions\nmorally justified civil disobedience? The tensions become clear when\nwe consider the criminal law\u2019s function, which is to punish and\nprevent crimes, that is, to tackle wrongful conduct. Unlike civil\nwrongs, which are privately brought, criminal wrongs are public\nwrongs: the polity, not the victim (there may not be any), prosecutes\nthe alleged wrongdoer. Punishment, depending on one\u2019s\noverarching account, serves to: dissuade people from committing the\ntypes of conduct identified as wrongful (Bentham 1789 [1970]);\nappropriately respond to those who culpably commit them (Moore 1997),\nincluding by engaging with them in a moral dialogue so that they\nrepent and reform (Duff 1998); and/or express the community\u2019s\nmoral disapproval of such conduct (Feinberg 1994). So, we may ask,\nfrom the consequentialist, forward-looking standpoint, whether the\nstate should deter civil disobedience; and, from a retributivist\n(desert-based) or communicative, backward-looking perspective, whether\ncivil disobedients deserve the community\u2019s censure (Bennett and\nBrownlee 2021).\n\nIf civilly disobedient breaches of law are public wrongs, comparable\nto or worse than ordinary offenses, then civil disobedients should be\npunished similarly or more severely than those who commit ordinary\noffenses. Kent Greenawalt lays out reasons to hold that civil\ndisobedients deserve the same punishment as others who breach the same\nlaws. First, the demands of proportionality would seem to recommend a\nuniform application of legal prohibitions. Since trespass is\nprohibited, persons who breach trespass laws in protest of either\nthose laws or other laws would seem to be equally liable to persons\nwho breach trespass laws for private purposes. Second, any principle\nthat officials may use to excuse justified illegal acts will result in\nsome failures to punish unjustified acts, for which the purposes of\npunishment would be more fully served. Even when officials make\ncorrect judgments about which acts to excuse, citizens may draw\nmistaken inferences, and restraints of deterrence and norm acceptance\nmay be weakened for unjustified acts that resemble justified ones\n(Greenawalt 1987, 273). What follows is that all such violations,\njustified and unjustified, should be treated the same.\n\nThere also are reasons to believe that civil disobedients should be\ndealt with more severely than are others who have offended. First, as\nmentioned above, disobedients seem to have put themselves above the\nlaw in preferring their own moral judgment about a certain issue to\nthat of the democratic decision-making process and the rule of law.\nSecond, the communicative aspect of civil disobedience could be said\nto aggravate disobedient offenses since their communication usually is\nattended by much greater publicity than most covert violations are.\nThis forces legal authorities to concern themselves with the\npossibility that law-abiding citizens will feel distressed, insecure,\nand perhaps imposed on, if no action is taken. So, notes Greenawalt,\nwhile authorities may quietly let minor breaches pass, failure to\nrespond to violations performed, in some respect, in the presence of\nauthority, may undercut claims that the rules and the persons who\nadministered them deserve respect (1987, 351\u20132). Third, and\nrelated, civil disobedients often invite, and might inspire, other\ncitizens to do what they do. Such risk of proliferation of civil\ndisobedience and, further, of its escalation into lawlessness and\nviolence, may support the imposition of more severe punishment for\nagents engaged in civil disobedience.\n\nHowever, both the models of civil disobedience presented above, which\nstress its role and value in liberal democracies, and the arguments\nfor the right to civil disobedience examined below, strongly push for\nthe opposite view that civil disobedients, if punished at all, should\nbe dealt with more leniently than others who have offended. The\npreceding discussion highlights that civil disobedience is in fact a\npublic good \u2013 a crucial component of democratic culture, in\nHabermas\u2019s words \u2013 and, hence, many theorists defend the\nstate\u2019s responsibility to treat civil disobedients\nleniently.\n\nDworkin argues that the state has a \u201cspecial responsibility to\ntry to protect [the civil disobedient], and soften his predicament,\nwhenever it can do so without great damage to other policies\u201d\n(Dworkin 1978, 260). The government can exercise its responsibility of\nleniency by not prosecuting civil disobedience at all, depending on\nthe balance of reasons, including individual rights, state interests,\nsocial costs, and constitutional benefits. Reasons for prosecuting in\nany particular case are \u2018practical\u2019, not intrinsic or\ndeontological, and always potentially defeasible. In general,\nprosecutors should not charge disobedients with the most serious\noffenses applicable and judges should give them light sentences.\nLeniency follows from the recognition of the special constitutional\nstatus of civil disobedience.\n\nIn this view, officials at all levels have the discretion to not\nsanction civil disobedients, and they should use it. Prosecutors have\nand should use their discretion not to press charges against civil\ndisobedients in some cases, or to charge them with the least serious\noffense possible. Dworkin (1985) urges judges to engage in an open\ndialogue with civil disobedients (at least those who articulate legal\narguments in defense of their actions) and dismiss their charges after\nhearing them, or to use their discretion in sentencing, for instance\nby accepting guilty pleas or guilty verdicts but imposing trivial\npunishments.\n\nHowever, this proposal could amount to letting judges evaluate the\nworthiness of individual civil disobedients\u2019 causes, which would\nnot on its own guarantee judicial leniency. To the contrary, judges\nmight well systematically decide against civil disobedients, upholding\nthe special interests of the ruling class of which they are part. The\nproceduralist insistence on courts\u2019 neutrality avoids this\npitfall, and generally warns against turning courtrooms into political\nforums. Yet the transformation of courts into public fora might not be\nso insidious, and may indeed be part of a necessary institutional\nreform to provide civil disobedients with a platform, perhaps along\nthe lines of Arendt\u2019s (1972, 101\u20132) proposal to treat\ncivil disobedients as a kind of people\u2019s lobbyists (see Smith\n2011).\n4.2 A Right to Civil Disobedience\n\nFor Rawls, there is only a moral right to engage in justified\ncivil disobedience. But many other theorists defend at least a limited\nright to engage in civil disobedience irrespective of a particular\nact\u2019s justification, given the general value of the practice.\nDworkin (1978) outlines what such a right of conduct might look like,\nanalogizing civil disobedients with Supreme Court justices, who test\nthe constitutional validity of (unjust) law through direct\ndisobedience of that law. In doing so, they can make law more faithful\nto the principles of justice and fairness that justify it (on\nDworkin\u2019s theory of law). Some theorists accept the value of\nconstitutional challenges but argue that once the law is found by a\nhigh court to be constitutional and disobedients\u2019 initial\nconviction is upheld, disobedients have a duty to accept their\npunishment and recognize the law\u2019s validity (Fortas 1968;\nNussbaum 2019, 177). In contrast, Dworkin argues that forcing citizens\nto obey court decisions \u2013 including the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\u2013 would mean forcing them to do something their conscience\nforbids them to do, which would contravene the constitutional\nimperative, entrenched in the First Amendment and rooted in dignity,\nto respect individuals\u2019 \u201cright to conscience\u201d and\nprotect their freedom of speech.\n\nThe right to conscience, on this account, thus grounds a weak\n\u201cright to break the law\u201d. It is a right in the sense that\none \u201cdoes the right thing to break the law, so that we should\nall respect\u201d the agent when she follows her conscientious\njudgment about doubtful law and refuses to comply with a law that\nrequires her to do what her conscience forbids (Dworkin 1978,\n228\u201337), but it does not ground a right in the strong sense that\nthe government would do wrong to stop her from disobeying. In other\nwords, on this view, the right to disobedience is deemed to be\ncompatible with the state\u2019s right to punish. Contra Cohen (1966,\n6), Rawls (1999, 322), and others, however, Dworkin does not defend\nagents\u2019 moral duty to accept punishment (1985, 114\u20135). He\nconsiders non-evasion of legal sanctions to be a good strategy for\ncivil disobedients denouncing unconstitutional law and unjust policy\n(justice- and policy-based civil disobedience on his\nview) but denies that accepting punishment is a conceptual, moral, or\ntactical requirement for civil disobedience motivated by personal\nconvictions (\u2018integrity-based\u2019 civil disobedience). For\nthe latter, Dworkin argues that utilitarian reasons for punishing\nshould be weighed against the fact that the accused acted out of\nprincipled convictions, and that the balance should generally favor\nleniency.\n\nJoseph Raz puts forward a different account of the right to civil\ndisobedience, insisting that this right extends to cases in which\npeople ought not to exercise the right: it is part of the nature and\npurpose of rights of conduct that they give persons a protected sphere\nin which to act rightly or wrongly. To say that there is a right to\ncivil disobedience is to allow the legitimacy of resorting to this\nform of political action for causes one opposes (Raz 1979, 268). That\nsaid, Raz places great emphasis on the kind of regime in which a\ndisobedient acts, arguing that only in an illiberal regime could\nindividuals have a right to civil disobedience to reclaim their\npolitical participation rights which their illiberal state is\nviolating: they are entitled to \u201cdisregard the offending laws\nand exercise their moral right as if it were recognized by law.\u201d\nRaz adds that \u201cmembers of the illiberal state do have a right to\ncivil disobedience which is roughly that part of their moral right to\npolitical participation which is not recognized in law\u201d (Raz\n1979, 272\u20133). By contrast, in a liberal state, the right to\npolitical activity is, by hypothesis, adequately protected by law and,\nhence, the right to political participation cannot ground a right to\ncivil disobedience.\n\nA different view of rights holds that when a person appeals to\npolitical participation rights to defend her disobedience, she does\nnot necessarily criticize the law for outlawing her action. Lefkowitz\nmaintains that members of minorities can appreciate that democratic\ndiscussions often must be cut short so that decisions may be taken,\nand those who engage in civil disobedience may view current policy as\nthe best compromise between the need to act and the need to\naccommodate continued debate. Nonetheless, they also can point out\nthat, with greater resources or further time for debate, their view\nmight have held sway. Given this possibility, the right to political\nparticipation must include a right to continue to contest the result\nafter the votes are counted or the decisions taken. And this right\nshould include suitably constrained civil disobedience because the\nbest conception of political participation rights is one that reduces\nas much as possible the impact that luck has on the popularity of a\nview (Lefkowitz 2007; see also Smith 2013, ch. 4; Ceva 2015).\n\nAn alternative response to Raz questions whether the right to civil\ndisobedience must be derived from rights to political participation.\nBrownlee (2012, ch. 4) bases the right to civil disobedience on a\nright to object on the basis of sincere conviction. Whether such a\nright would fall under participation rights depends on the\nexpansiveness of the latter rights. When the right to participate is\nunderstood to accommodate only legal protest, then the right\nconscientiously to object, which commonsensically includes civil\ndisobedience, must be viewed as distinct from political participation\nrights.\n\nA further challenge to a regime-focused account is that real societies\ndo not align with a dichotomy between liberal and illiberal regimes;\nrather they fall along a spectrum of liberality and illiberality,\nbeing both more or less liberal relative to each other and being more\nor less liberal in some domains than in others. Perhaps, in a society\nthat approximates a liberal regime, the political-participation case\nfor a right to civil disobedience diminishes, but to make legally\nprotected participation fully adequate, a liberal society would have\nto address Bertrand Russell\u2019s charge that controllers of the\nmedia give defenders of unpopular views few opportunities to make\ntheir case unless they resort to sensational methods such as\ndisobedience (1998, 635).\n4.3 Accommodating Civil Disobedience\n\nPhilosophers have typically focused on the question of how courts\nshould treat civil disobedients, while neglecting to apply that\nquestion to law enforcement. Yet the police have much discretion in\nhow to deal with civil disobedients. In particular, they have no\nobligation to arrest protesters when they commit minor violations of\nthe law such as traffic obstruction: accommodation of and\ncommunication with protesters is something they can but all too rarely\ndecide to do. Instead, many governments practice militarized\nrepression of protests. Local police departments in the U.S. often\nrespond to demonstrations with riot gear and other military equipment.\nAlso, the British government sought to strengthen public order laws\nand secure new police powers to crack down on Extinction Rebellion\n(XR), the global environmental movement whose street protests,\ndie-ins, and roadblocks for climate justice have brought cities to a\nstandstill.\n\nOne notable exception to the theoretical neglect of law enforcement is\nSmith\u2019s (2013, ch. 5) articulation of a \u201cpolicing\nphilosophy\u201d that orientates policing strategies toward\naccommodation, rather than prevention or repression, of civil\ndisobedience. On Smith\u2019s view, \u201cthe police should, where\npossible, cooperate with civilly disobedient activists in order to\nassist in their commission of a protest that is effective as an\nexpression of their grievance against law or policy\u201d (2013,\n111). Accommodation requires communication channels between police and\nactivists and involves strategies such as pre-negotiated arrests.\nWhile the U.S. often implements punitive and strong-handed law\nenforcement strategies, the U.K.\u2019s current goal (at the time of\nwriting) is, according to one senior police source, to develop\n\u2018move forward\u2019 \u2013 proactive and preventive \u2013\ntactics that are designed to clear the streets of XR demonstrators.\nNeither approach respects anything like a right to civil\ndisobedience.\n\nA constitutional government committed to recognizing the right to\ncivil disobedience would also have to reform part of its criminal laws\nand make available certain defenses. Brownlee proposes two. First,\ndisobedients should have access to a\n\u201cdemands-of-conviction,\u201d excusatory defense to point to\nthe deep and sincere reasons they had for believing they were\njustified in acting the way they did (Brownlee 2012, ch. 5). Second,\nstates should accept necessity as a justificatory defense for civil\ndisobedience undertaken as a reasonable and parsimonious response to\nviolations of and threats to non-contingent basic needs (Brownlee\n2012, ch. 6). As these defenses suggest, constitutionally recognizing\ncivil disobedience does not mean making civil disobedience legal.\nDisobedients would still be arrested and prosecuted, but they would\nget to explain and defend their actions in court. They would be\nheard.\n5. Conclusion\n\nThere have been shifts in the paradigm forms and goals of civil\ndisobedience over the past century, from the suffragettes\u2019\nmilitant activism in pursuit of their basic rights of citizenship to\nthe youth climate movement\u2019s school walkouts and mass\ndemonstrations to demand governments take urgent action to combat the\nclimate crisis. Even so, civil disobedience remains an enduring,\nvibrant part of political activism and, increasingly, benefits from\ntransnational alliances.\n\nTheorists have long assumed that civil disobedience only begs\njustification in liberal, democratic societies \u2013 the best\nreal-world candidates for legitimate states. However, civil\ndisobedience also raises questions in undemocratic and illegitimate\ncontexts, regarding its overall role, strategic value, and tactical\nefficacy. For instance, disobedient protests in support of democracy\nin Hong Kong may not be presumptively impermissible given\nChina\u2019s authoritarian rule. Yet they still beg significant\nquestions concerning the proper contours of extra-institutional\ndissident politics and the justification of uncivil and forceful\ntactics in repressive contexts, including violence against police and\nthe destruction of pro-China shops and Chinese banks.\n\nFinally, whereas theorists have tended to think of civil disobedience\nas generally undertaken to achieve worthy public goals, liberal\ndemocratic states have recently witnessed much disobedience in pursuit\nof anti-democratic and illiberal goals, including conscientious\nrefusal to abide by antidiscrimination statutes and violations of, and\nprotests against, laws requiring the provision of reproductive\nservices and the public health measures enacted to slow the spread of\nthe coronavirus. We may need a different lens than liberal and\ndemocratic theorists have offered to evaluate the full range of\nconservative social movements, counter-movements, and reactionary\nmovements which resort to civil (and other forms of) disobedience.",
