    "main_text": "Premise I: The Interaction Principle || Mental Causation\n2.2 Mental Causation\n\nThough this will be focused on separately below\n (6),\n it is also important to recognize that we are beginning with the\nassumption that mental events cause and are caused by physical events.\nMany critics of Anomalous Monism have claimed that it is difficult to\nsee how the position avoids epiphenomenalism\u2014the view that\nmental events are causally/explanatorily impotent\u2014and that\nAnomalous Monism is therefore unacceptable as an account of the place\nof the mental in the physical world. However, since Anomalous Monism\nis based upon the interaction principle, Davidson can claim\nin response that if Anomalous Monism is true, then mental events are\nalready known to have a kind of causal efficacy. As we shall see, this\npoint is not by itself sufficient to ward off all epiphenomenalist\nconcerns about Anomalous Monism. But it does serve to remind us of the\nfull framework within which challenges to Anomalous Monism must be\nassessed, and in particular brings out the reliance of that framework\non specific assumptions about causality (see Sections\n 4.3,\n 6, and Yalowitz 1998a).\n\nWhat needs to be noted at this point is that Davidson argued early on\nfor the claim that mental events have causal efficacy, through noting\na problem for non-causal accounts of action explanation (Davidson\n1963). Mental events and states explain action by making it\nintelligible\u2014rational\u2014in light of the agent\u2019s\nbeliefs and purposes. The challenge that Davidson raised for\nnon-causal theories of action explanation was to account for the fact\nthat, for any action performed, there may well be a large number of\nmental events and states true of the agent, and capable of\nrationalizing the action, but that don\u2019t thereby\nexplain that action. The agent acted because of some\nspecific beliefs and purposes, but other beliefs and purposes of his\ncould just as easily rationalize that action, and thus be cited in its\nexplanation. Was the agent moving his hand as he did because he wanted\nto swat the fly, relieve a cramp, or wave in greeting? He may well\nhave wanted to achieve all three of these aims, but still only in fact\nperformed the action because of one of these reasons. How do\nwe understand \u2018because\u2019 so as to rule out the pretenders?\nDavidson\u2019s claim was that it is only if we understand\n\u2018because\u2019 as \u2018was caused by\u2019 that we can\njustifiably pick out the genuine explanans\u2014thereby\nimputing causal potency to mental events.\n\nWhat exactly does this argument show? It is intended to tell against\nnon-causal theories of action, which deny that reasons explain actions\nby causing them. There have been sophisticated attempts, on the behalf\nof non-causal theories of action explanation, to respond to this\nchallenge (von Wright 1971; Wilson 1985; Ginet 1995; for a good\noverview, see Stoutland 1976; and see related discussion in\n 6.3.)\n However, assuming the argument is successful, while it does establish\nmental efficacy of a kind, it does not by itself establish the\ninteraction principle. Establishing that reasons explain actions by\ncausing them, and that therefore reasons causally interact with\nactions, does not establish that reasons causally interact\nwith physical events. Dualists who reject the identity of\nmental and physical events will surely object.\n\nA key point to grasp in many of the issues raised by Anomalous Monism\nis that there is an important distinction between action and behavior.\nAccording to Davidson, action is intentionally described\nbehavior\u2014the moving of a hand through space in a certain way\nmay, but need not, be an action of waving or swatting or any action at\nall. It may simply be mere bodily behavior\u2014as happens as the\nresult of a muscle twitch or a strong gust of wind. The behavior must\nbe caused by an agent\u2019s beliefs and desires in order to be\naction. However, while this is necessary for action, it is not,\naccording to Davidson, sufficient. The behavior must be caused in\nthe right way by the beliefs and desires. Davidson notes the\npossibility of cases where an agent\u2019s beliefs and desires cause\nbehavior which is not rationalized by those states, and thus not\naction. A mountain climber might become so unnerved by his desire to\nrid himself of an annoying second climber sharing his rope and belief\nthat jiggling the rope is a means for doing so that he unintentionally\njiggles the rope, leading to the loss of the second climber. This is\nnot an action\u2014it is mere behavior that happens to him, no\ndifferent than if caused by a muscle twitch or gust of wind. It is\ncaused in the wrong way\u2014a \u201cdeviant causal\nchain\u201d\u2014by the belief and desire, and so is not an action.\nDavidson is skeptical about the possibility of cashing out what it\nmeans to be caused in the right way (Davidson 1973b,\n78\u20139), for reasons relating to mental anomalism (Davidson 1973b,\n80; see\n 4\n for explicit discussion). The key point for now is that because\nDavidson rejects the possibility of analyzing action in terms of\nbehavior caused in a particular way by reasons, the point made by the\n\u2018because\u2019 argument cannot be used to establish that mental\nevents cause physical events. It does not follow from the fact that\nreasons must cause actions in order to explain them that\nreasons must cause behavior or (the interaction principle)\nthat reasons do cause behavior. It does not entail that\nactions are physical behavior.\n\nThis point is important when one considers the wider framework to\nwhich the interaction principle contributes. Since Davidson is\nattempting to derive monism from it and other principles that are\nthemselves neutral about the metaphysics of mind, he cannot assume\nthat action is (identical with) behavior on pain of circularity. Once\nmonism has been established, Davidson will be in a position to deploy\nthe \u2018because\u2019 point in order to argue for the claim that\nmental events are causally efficacious with respect to physical\nevents. How this relates to the wave of epiphenomenalist criticism\nabout Anomalous Monism will be explored in detail below\n (6,\n and see the supplement on\n Mental Properties and Causal Relevance).\n To summarize, the interaction principle is an unargued assumption in\nthe Davidsonian framework, one that does not assume monism, and the\n\u2018because\u2019 argument, while important for ruling out\nnon-causal theories of action, does not itself establish the\ninteraction principle.\n",
