    "main_text": "\n\n\nA miracle (from the Latin mirari, to wonder), at a first\nand very rough approximation, is an event that is not explicable by\nnatural causes alone. A reported miracle excites wonder because it\nappears to require, as its cause, something beyond the reach of human\naction and natural causes. Historically, the appeal to miracles has\nformed one of the primary lines of argument in favor of specific forms\nof theism, the argument typically being that the event in question can\nbest (or can only) be explained as the act of a particular deity.\n",
