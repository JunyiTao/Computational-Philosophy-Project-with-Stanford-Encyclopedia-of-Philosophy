    "main_text": "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847) || Hypothetical Syllogisms\n3.7 Hypothetical Syllogisms\n\nOn p. 48 of MAL Boole said: \n\nA hypothetical Proposition is defined to be two or more\ncategoricals united by a copula (or conjunction), and the\ndifferent kinds of hypothetical Propositions are named from their\nrespective conjunctions, viz. conditional (if), disjunctive (either,\nor), &c.\n\n\nBoole analyzed the seven hypothetical syllogisms that were\nstandard in Aristotelian logic, from the Constructive and Destructive\nConditionals to the Complex Destructive Dilemma. Letting capital\nletters \\(X, Y, \\ldots\\) represent categorical propositions, the\nhypothetical propositions traditionally involved in\nhypothetical syllogisms were in one of the forms \\(X\\) is\ntrue, \\(X\\) is false, If \\(X\\) is true\nthen \\(Y\\) is true, \\(X\\) is true or \\(Y\\) is true or \n\u2026, \nas well as \n\\(X\\) is true and \\(Y\\) is true and \u2026  \nAt the end of the\nchapter on hypothetical syllogisms he noted that it was easy to create\nnew ones, and one could enrich the collection by using mixed\nhypothetical propositions such as If \\(X\\) is true, then\neither \\(Y\\) is true, or \\(Z\\) is true. \n\nMost important in this chapter was Boole\u2019s \nclaim that his algebra of\nlogic for categorical propositions was equally suited to the study of\nhypothetical syllogisms. This was based on adopting the standard\nreduction of hypothetical propositions to propositions about classes\nby letting the hypothetical universe, also denoted by 1, \n\u201ccomprehend all conceivable\ncases and conjunctures of circumstances\u201d.\nEvidently his notion of a case \nwas an assignment of truth values to the propositional variables.\nFor \\(X\\) a categorical proposition Boole let \\(x\\) denote the elective\noperator that selects the cases for which \\(X\\) is true.  \n\n Boole said the universe of a categorical proposition has two\ncases, true and false. To find an equational\nexpression for a hypothetical proposition Boole resorted to a near\nrelative of truth tables (MAL, p. 50). To each case, that is,\nassignment of truth values to \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), he associated an\nelective expression as follows:\n\n\nCases\nElective Expressions\n\n\nX true, Y true\n\\(xy\\)\n\n\nX true, Y false\n\\(x(1- y)\\)\n\n\nX false, Y true\n\\((1 - x)y\\)\n\n\nX false, Y false\n\\((1 - x)(1 - y)\\)\n\n\n\n\nThese elective expressions are, of course, the constituents\nof \\(x\\), \\(y\\).\n\n\n\nBoole expressed a propositional formula \\(\\Phi(X,Y, \\ldots)\\) by\nan elective equation \\(\\phi(x,y, \\ldots)\\) = 1 by ascertaining all the\ndistinct cases (assignments of truth values) for which the formula\nholds,\nand summing their corresponding elective expressions to obtain \\(\\phi\\).\n\n\nFor example, the elective expression for \\(X\\) is true or \\(Y\\) is true, with\nor inclusive, is thus \\(xy + x(1 - y) + (1 - x)y = 1\\),\nwhich simplifies to \\(x + y - xy = 1\\). \n\n\n\nBoole did not have the modern view that a propositional formula can be\nconsidered as a function on the truth values \\(\\{\\rT, \\rF\\}\\), taking \nvalues in \\(\\{\\rT,\\rF\\}\\).\n \nThe function viewpoint gives us an algorithm to determine which\nconstituents are to be summed to give the desired elective expression,\nnamely those constituents associated with the cases for which the\npropositional formula has the value \\(\\rT\\).  \n\n\nBy not viewing propositional formulas as functions on \\(\\{\\)T, F\\(\\}\\) Boole\nmissed out on being the inventor of truth tables. His algebraic\nmethod of analyzing hypothetical syllogisms was to transform each of\nthe hypothetical premises into an elective equation, and then apply\nhis algebra of logic (which was developed for categorical\npropositions). For example, the premises \\(X\\) is true\nor \\(Y\\) is true, with or inclusive, and \\(X\\) is false \nare expressed by the equations\n\\(x + y - xy = 1\\) and\n\\(x = 0\\). From these it immediately follows that\n\\(y = 1\\), giving the conclusion\n\\(Y\\) is true.\n\n\n\nBoole only considered rather simple hypothetical propositions on the\ngrounds these were the only ones encountered in common usage (see\nLT, p. 172). His algebraic approach to propositional logic\nis easily extended to all propositional formulas as follows. For\n\\(\\Phi\\) a propositional formula the associated elective function\n\\(\\Phi^*\\) is defined recursively as follows:\n\n\n\\(0^* = 0\\); \\(1^* = 1\\); \\(X^* = x\\);\n\\((\\text{not-}\\Phi)^* = 1 - \\Phi^*\\);\n\\((\\Phi \\text{ and } \\Psi)^* = \\Phi^* \\cdot \\Psi^*\\);\n\\((\\Phi \\text{ or } \\Psi)^* = \\Phi^* + \\Psi^* - \\Phi^* \\cdot\n\\Psi^*\\), \u00a0where \u201cor\u201d is inclusive;\n\\((\\Phi \\text{ or } \\Psi)^* = \\Phi^* + \\Psi^* - 2\\Phi^* \\cdot \\Psi^*\\),\n\u00a0where \u201cor\u201d is exclusive; \n\\((\\Phi \\text{ implies } \\Psi)^* = 1 - \\Phi^* + \\Phi^* \\cdot\n\\Psi^*\\);\n\\((\\Phi \\text{ iff } \\Psi)^* = \\Phi^* \\cdot \\Psi^* + (1 - \\Phi^*)\n\\cdot(1 - \\Psi^*)\\).\n\n\nThen one has:\n\n\\(\\Phi\\) is a tautology iff \\(\\Phi^* = 1\\) \nis valid in Boole\u2019s algebra.\n\\(\\Phi_1\\), ... , \\(\\Phi_k \\therefore \\Phi\\) is valid in\npropositional logic iff \\(\\Phi_{1}^* = 1, \\ldots , \\Phi_{k}^* = 1\n\\therefore \\Phi^* = 1\\) is valid in Boole\u2019s algebra.\n\n\n\nThis looks quite different from modern propositional logic where one\ntakes a few tautologies, such as \\(X \\rightarrow(Y \\rightarrow X)\\), as axioms, and inference rules such as modus ponens to\nform a deductive system. \n\nThis translation, from \\(\\Phi\\) to \\(\\Phi^*\\), viewed as mapping\nexpressions from modern Boolean algebra to polynomials, would be\npresented in the 1933 paper Characteristic functions and the algebra of logic\n by Hassler Whitney (1907\u20131989), with\nthe objective of showing that one does not need to learn the algebra\nof logic [modern Boolean algebra] to verify the equational laws and\nequational arguments of Boolean algebra\u2014they can be translated\ninto the ordinary algebra with which one is familiar. Howard Aiken\n(1900\u20131973), Director of the Harvard Computation Laboratory,\nwould use such translations of logical functions into ordinary algebra\nin his 1951 book Synthesis of Electronic Computing and Control\nCircuits, specifically stating that he preferred Boole\u2019s\nnumerical function approach to that of Boolean algebra or\npropositional logic.\n\n",
