    "main_text": "\n\nAlthough the Japanese have been producing great art and writing about\nit for many centuries, including a rich tradition of poetics going\nback a millennium, the philosophical discipline in Japan corresponding\nto Western \u201caesthetics\u201d did not get underway until the\nnineteenth century. A good way to survey the broader field is to\nexamine the most important aesthetic ideas that have arisen in the\ncourse of the tradition, all of them before aesthetics was formally\nestablished as a discipline: namely, mono no aware (the\npathos of things), wabi (subdued, austere beauty),\nsabi (rustic patina), y\u016bgen (mysterious\nprofundity), iki (refined style), and kire\n(cutting). (This last term is pronounced as two evenly accented\nsyllables, kee-reh. The macrons over some vowels signify a\nvowel sound of double length. When a person name is used, the order is\nthe conventional Japanese one: family name, then given name.)\n",
