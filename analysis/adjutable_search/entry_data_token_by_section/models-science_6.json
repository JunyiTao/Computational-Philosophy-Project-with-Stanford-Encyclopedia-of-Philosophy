Epistemology: The Cognitive Functions of Models\n\nOne of the main reasons why models play such an important role in\nscience is that they perform a number of cognitive functions. For\nexample, models are vehicles for learning about the world. Significant\nparts of scientific investigation are carried out on models rather\nthan on reality itself because by studying a model we can discover\nfeatures of, and ascertain facts about, the system the model stands\nfor: models allow for \u201csurrogative reasoning\u201d (Swoyer\n1991). For instance, we study the nature of the hydrogen atom, the\ndynamics of a population, or the behavior of a polymer by studying\ntheir respective models. This cognitive function of models has been\nwidely acknowledged in the literature, and some even suggest that\nmodels give rise to a new style of reasoning, \u201cmodel-based\nreasoning\u201d, according to which \u201cinferences are made by\nmeans of creating models and manipulating, adapting, and evaluating\nthem\u201d (Nersessian 2010: 12; see also Magnani, Nersessian, and\nThagard 1999; Magnani and Nersessian 2002; and Magnani and Casadio\n2016).\n",
