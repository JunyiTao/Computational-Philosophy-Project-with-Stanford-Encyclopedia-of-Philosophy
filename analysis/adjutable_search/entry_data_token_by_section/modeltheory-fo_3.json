We have already\nseen several constructions in the theorems above: for example the\nomitting types construction and the initial model construction. Here\nare three more. \n4.1 Products and reduced products\n\n\nIf A and B are L-structures, we form their\nproduct C = A \u00d7 B as\nfollows. The elements of C are the ordered pairs\n(a,b) where a is an element of A\nand b is an element of B. The predicate symbols are\ninterpreted \u2018pointwise\u2019, i.e. so that for example \n(a,b) is in PC if and only if\na is in PA and b is in\nPB.\n\n\nThe structures A and B are called the\nfactors of A \u00d7 B. In the same way\nwe can form products of any number of structures. If all the factors of\na product are the same structure A, the product is called a\npower of A. A theorem called the Feferman-Vaught\ntheorem tells us how to work out the complete theory of the\nproduct from the complete theories of its factors. \n\n\nThis construction has some variants. We can define an equivalence\nrelation on the domain of a product C, and then take a\nstructure D whose elements are the equivalence classes; the\npredicate symbols are interpreted in D so as to make the\nnatural map from dom(C) to dom(D) a homomorphism. In\nthis case the structure D is called a reduced product\nof the factors of C. It is a reduced power of\nA if all the factors are equal to A; in this case the\ndiagonal map from A to D is the one got by\ntaking each element a to the equivalence class of the element\n(a,a,\u2026).\n\n\nSuppose we use a set I to index the factors in a product\nC. An ultrafilter over I is a set U\nof subsets of I with the properties\n\nif sets X and Y are in U then so is\ntheir intersection X \u2229 Y;\nif X is in U and X \u2286 Y \u2286 I\nthen Y is in U;\nfor each subset X of I, exactly one of X\nand its complement I \\ X is in U.\n\n\n\nIf we have an ultrafilter U over I, then we can\nconstruct a reduced product from C by making two elements of\nC equivalent if and only if the set of indices at which they\nare equal is a set in the ultrafilter U. This is indeed an\nequivalence relation on the domain of C, and the resulting\nreduced product is called an ultraproduct of the factors of\nC. If C is a power of A then this\nultraproduct is called an ultrapower of A, and it is\nsometimes written U-prod A. A theorem called\n\u0141o\u015b\u2019s theorem describes what sentences are true in\nan ultraproduct. Its most useful consequence is the following: \nIf U is an ultrafilter then the diagonal map from\nA to U-prod A is an elementary\nembedding.\n\n\nIf the ultrafilter U is nonprincipal, i.e. contains\nno finite sets, then the diagonal map is not onto the domain of\nU-prod A, and in fact U-prod A is\ngenerally much larger than A. So we have a way of constructing\nlarge elementary extensions. The axiom of choice guarantees that every\ninfinite set has many nonprincipal ultrafilters over it. Ultrapowers\nare an essential tool for handling large cardinals in set theory (see\nthe entry on\n set theory).\n\n\nA remarkable (but in practice not terribly useful) theorem of\nSaharon Shelah tells us that a pair of structures A and\nB are elementarily equivalent if and only if they have\nultrapowers that are isomorphic to each other.\n4.2 Saturation\n\n\nSuppose A is an L-structure, X is a set of elements\nof A, B is an elementary extension of A and\nb, c are two elements of B. Then b\nand c are said to have the same type over X if for\nevery formula\n\u03c6(v1,\u2026,vn+1)\nof L and every n-tuple d of elements of X, \nB\n \u22a8\n\u03c6[b,d] \u21d4 B\n \u22a8\n \u03c6[c,d].\n\n\nWe say that A is saturated if whenever X is\na set of elements of A, of cardinality less than that of\nA, and B is any elementary extension of A,\nwe always have that every element of B has the same type over\nX as some element already in A. \n\n\nThis rather heavy definition gives little clue how useful saturated\nstructures are. If every structure had a saturated elementary\nextension, many of the results of model theory would be much easier to\nprove. Unfortunately the existence of saturated elementary extensions\ndepends on features of the surrounding universe of sets. There are\ntechnical ways around this obstacle, for example using weakenings of\nthe notion of saturation. We have two main ways of constructing\nelementary extensions with some degree of saturation. One is by\nultrapowers, using cleverly constructed ultrafilters. The other is by\ntaking unions of elementary chains, generalising the proof we gave for\nthe upward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem.\n\n\nThe existence of partially saturated elementary extensions of the\nfield R of real numbers is the main technical\nfact behind Abraham Robinson\u2019s nonstandard analysis. See\nSection 4 of the entry on\n model theory\nfor more information on this. Though model theory provided the first\nsteps in nonstandard analysis, this branch of analysis rapidly became a\nsubject in its own right, and its links with first-order model theory\ntoday are rather slim.\n4.3 Ehrenfeucht-Mostowski models\n\n\nLet A be an L-structure, X a set of elements of\nA and < a linear ordering of X (not necessarily\ndefinable by a first-order formula). We say that (X,<) is\nan indiscernible sequence in A if for every natural\nnumber n, and all elements\na1,\u2026,an,b\n1,\u2026,b n of A such\nthat a1 < \u2026 <\nan and b1 <\n\u2026 < bn, the map taking each\nai to the corresponding\nbi is an elementary map. If T is a theory\nwith infinite models, then T has models that are the Skolem hulls (see\nthe entry on\n classical logic)\n of\nindiscernible sequences. These models are known as\nEhrenfeucht-Mostowski models, after the two Polish model\ntheorists who first carried out this construction in the mid 1950s.\nThese models tend to be the opposite of saturated; we can arrange that\nvery few types over sets of elements are represented among their\nelements. Some important distinctions between different models of set\ntheory can be expressed in terms of the indiscernible sequences within\nthese models; see the entry on\n set theory.\n",
