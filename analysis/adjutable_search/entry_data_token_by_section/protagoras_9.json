    "main_text": "Protagoras\u2019 Political Thought || Protagoras on technai\n5.2 Protagoras on technai\n\nThe comparison with the testimonies at our disposal on human\ncivilisation shows what is distinctive, and remarkable, of\nProtagoras\u2019 myth. Scholars insist on the parallels between the\nmyth and these other texts. The differences, however, are even more\ninteresting than the affinities. These texts all share a similar\naccount of the history of human civilisation, underlining the\nimportance of technical skills as the key condition for human\nprogress. From Aeschylus and the other tragic poets to the corpus\nhippocraticum and Diodorus/Democritus, the history of human\nprogress depends on technai, which are praised for enabling\nhuman beings to overcome natural needs and the perils of an hostile\nenvironment and thus to live a prosperous life (for a collection of\nthese texts see Cole 1967 or Guthrie 1971: 79\u201384; the only\nremarkable exception is the Sisyphus fragment, 88B25 DK,\nwhich is later and clearly reminiscent of sophistical ideas).\nTechne is what marks the distinction between civilisation and\nsavagery, and between human beings and animals. In Protagoras\u2019\nmyth, on the contrary, technai do not play a decisive\nrole\u2014they do not suffice to warrant human survival and\nprosperity. Protagoras rather insists on the fact that\ntechnai, alone, are not able to warrant human progress, nor\nhuman survival, for the problem is not external, natural necessities,\nbut internal, the human tendency to prevaricate and commit injustice:\n\n\n\nwhen they gathered together, they committed injustice against one\nanother\u2026so that they scattered once again and were destroyed.\n(Protagoras 322b) \n\n\nThis is a remarkable difference, which changes the terms of the\nproblem. Technical skills can help with natural necessities, but are\nnot useful with human relations, which is by far a much more\ncomplicated problem. The emphasis on technai turns out to be\nexcessive. What warrant human prosperity is the enactment of norms and\nlaws (the problem of dike, justice), along with ethical and\nmoral values (aidos, shame). These ideas are only sketched in\nthe myth, but will be extensively developed in the second part of his\nspeech, where Protagoras repeatedly underlines the political nature of\nhuman beings (see Protagoras 323a, 323b\u2013c, 324c\u2013325a).\nProtagoras\u2019 myth, by underlining this point, presents a very\nsubtle attack against technai and forcefully defends the\nimportance of political art, which is the object of his teaching.\n\nInterestingly, Protagoras\u2019 critical attitude towards\ntechnai is also confirmed by other Platonic and, even more\nimportant, non-Platonic testimonies. In Protagoras 318e\u2013319a\nProtagoras attacks Prodicus and Hippias because by only teaching\ntechnai such as \u201carithmetic, astronomy, geometry, and\nmusic\u201d they do not teach the pupils what is really important for\nthe polis (that is, political art). Protagoras\u2019\nargument seems to be that these specialised kinds of expertise are not\nreally useful to the life of the polis, contrary to what is\nclaimed by its supporters. Analogously, Aristotle\n(Metaphysics 998a2-4 = 80B7 DK) and Philodemus (On\nPoems, fr. 11 = 80B7a DK; but the reconstruction of this text is\ncontroversial, see Romeo 1992) inform us that Protagoras attacked\ngeometry and perhaps astronomy and geodesics by arguing that their\nabstract investigations are hardly compatible with the results of\nempirical observation (\u201ca hoop does not touch a straight edge at\na point\u201d, Protagoras argued according to Aristotle,\nMetaphysics 998a2-4 = 80B7 DK); therefore they amount to an\ninsignificant verbal game of no utility. These are probably the\narguments to which Plato himself was alluding to in the\nSophist (232d\u2013e = 80B8 DK) when he reports that Protagoras\nwas teaching how \u201cto contradict each of the artisans\u201d in\nOn Wrestling and the Other Arts. In Protagoras we therefore\nfind two lines of attack against the technai. The first goes\nagainst the widespread view that the technai played a decisive\nrole in achieving civilised society by arguing that they are necessary\nbut not sufficient. Secondly, he attacked some specific\ntechnai such as geometry or astronomy as useless. These are\nadmittedly different arguments and criticisms. But combined together,\nthey seem to confirm the importance of politics and the political art,\nwhich are the objects of Protagoras\u2019 teaching.\n",
