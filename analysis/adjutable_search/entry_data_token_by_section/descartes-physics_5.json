    "main_text": "The Laws of Motion and the Cartesian Conservation Principle\n4. The Laws of Motion and the Cartesian Conservation Principle\n\nForemost among the achievements of Descartes\u2019 physics are the\nthree laws of nature (which, essentially, are laws of bodily motion).\nNewton\u2019s own laws of motion would be modeled on this Cartesian\nbreakthrough, as is readily apparent in Descartes\u2019 first two\nlaws of nature: the first states \u201cthat each thing, as far as is\nin its power, always remains in the same state; and that consequently,\nwhen it is once moved, it always continues to move\u201d (Pr II 37),\nwhile the second holds that \u201call movement is, of itself, along\nstraight lines\u201d (Pr II 39; these two would later be incorporated\ninto Newton\u2019s first law of motion). By declaring that motion and\nrest are primitive states of material bodies without need of\nfurther explanation, and that bodies only change their state when\nacted upon by an external cause, it is not an exaggeration to claim\nthat Descartes helped to lay the foundation for the modern theory of\ndynamics (which studies the motion of bodies under the action of\nforces). For the Aristotelian-influenced Scholastics who had\nendeavored to ascertain the causal principles responsible for the\n\u201cviolent\u201d motions of terrestrial bodies (as opposed to\ntheir \u201cnatural\u201d motions to specific regions of the\nplenum), the explanation for these forced, unnatural motions seemed to\nlie in some type of internal bodily property, or external agent, that\nwas temporarily possessed by, or applied to, a body\u2014an\nexplanation that accounts for the fact that the body\u2019s motion\nboth originates and concludes in a state of rest (since, while on the\nearth\u2019s surface, the terrestrial element has no natural\nmotions). According to the medieval \u201cimpetus\u201d theory, for\nexample, these violent motions occur when a quality is directly\ntransferred to a body from a moving or constrained source, say, from a\nstretched bow to the waiting arrow. This property causes the observed\nbodily motion until such time that it is completely exhausted, thus\nbringing about a cessation of the violent movement (and the\narrow\u2019s fall back to earth). Implicit in the Scholastic view is\nthe basic belief that a terrestrial body continuously resists change\nfrom a state of rest while situated upon the earth, since the\ndepletion of the impetus property eventually effects a corresponding\nreturn of the body\u2019s original motionless, earthbound condition.\nDescartes, on the other hand, interpreted the phenomena of motion in\nan entirely new light, for he accepts the existence of inertial motion\n(uniform or non-accelerating motion) as a natural bodily state\nalongside, and on equal footing with, the notion of bodily rest. He\nargues, \u201cbecause experience seems to have proved it to us on\nmany occasions, we are still inclined to believe that all movements\ncease by virtue of their own nature, or that bodies have a tendency\ntowards rest. Yet this is assuredly in complete contradiction to the\nlaws of nature; for rest is the opposite of movement, and nothing\nmoves by virtue of its own nature towards its opposite or own\ndestruction\u201d (Pr II 37). While one can find several natural\nphilosophers whose earlier or contemporary work strongly foreshadowed\nDescartes\u2019 achievement in the first and second\nlaws\u2014namely, Galileo and Isaac Beeckman (see Arthur\n2007)\u2014the precise formulation put forward in the Principles\nof Philosophy is quite unique (especially as regards the second\nlaw, since both Galileo and Beeckman appear to sanction a form of\ncircular inertial motion, which possibly betrays the influence of the\nScholastic\u2019s circular motion of the celestial element). A\nfascinating blending of Scholasticism and the new physics is also\nevident in the above quotation, since Descartes invokes the logic of\ncontrary properties in his statement that \u201cnothing moves by\nvirtue of its own nature towards its opposite or own\ndestruction\u201d. That is, rest and motion are opposite or contrary\nstates, and since opposite states cannot (via the Scholastic\nprinciple) transform into one another, it follows that a body at rest\nwill remains at rest and a body in motion will remains in motion.\nConsequently, Descartes has employed a Scholastic/Medieval argument to\nground what is possibly the most important concept in the formation of\nmodern physics, namely inertia. Yet, it is important to note that\nDescartes\u2019 first and second laws do not correspond to the modern\nconcept of inertia, since he incorrectly regards (uniform,\nnon-accelerating) motion and rest as different bodily states, whereas\nmodern theory dictates that they are the same state.\n\nWhile Descartes\u2019 first and second laws deal with the rest and\nmotion of individual bodies, the third law of motion is expressly\ndesigned to reveal the properties exhibited among several bodies\nduring their collisions and interactions. In short, the third law\naddresses the behavior of bodies under the normal conditions in his\nmatter-filled world; when they collide: \u201cThe third law: that a\nbody, upon coming in contact with a stronger one, loses none of its\nmotion; but that, upon coming in contact with a weaker one, it loses\nas much as it transfers to that weaker body\u201d (Pr II 40). In the\nfollowing sections of the Principles, Descartes makes\nexplicit the conserved quantity mentioned in this third law:\n\nWe must however notice carefully at this time in what the force of\neach body to act against another or resist the action of that other\nconsists: namely, in the single fact that each thing strives, as far\nas in its power, to remain in the same state, in accordance with the\nfirst law stated above\u2026.This force must be measured not only by\nthe size of the body in which it is, and by the [area of the] surface\nwhich separates this body from those around it; but also by the speed\nand nature of its movement, and by the different ways in which bodies\ncome in contact with one another. (Pr II 43)\n\n\nAs a consequence of his first law of motion, Descartes insists that\nthe quantity conserved in collisions equals the combined sum of the\nproducts of size and speed of each impacting body. Although a\ndifficult concept, the \u201csize\u201d of a body roughly\ncorresponds to its volume, with surface area playing an indirect role\nas well. This conserved quantity, which Descartes refers to\nindiscriminately as \u201cmotion\u201d or \u201cquantity of\nmotion\u201d, is historically significant in that it marks one of the\nfirst attempts to locate an invariant or unchanging feature of bodily\ninteractions. To give an example, if a body B of size 3 and\nspeed 5 collides with a body C of size 2 and speed 4, then\nthe total quantity of motion of the system is 23, a quantity which\nremains preserved after the collision even though the bodies may\npossess different speeds.\n\nMoreover, Descartes envisions the conservation of quantity of motion\nas one of the fundamental governing principles of the entire cosmos.\nWhen God created the universe, he reasons, a certain finite amount of\nmotion (quantity of motion) was transmitted to its material occupants;\na quantity, moreover, that God continuously preserves at each\nsucceeding moment. (For more on the difficult issue of God\u2019s\ncontinuous recreation or preservation of the material world, see,\ne.g., Gorham 2004, Hattab 2007, and Schmaltz 2008).\n\nIt is obvious that when God first created the world, He not only moved\nits parts in various ways, but also simultaneously caused some of the\nparts to push others and to transfer their motion to these others. So\nin now maintaining the world by the same action and with the same laws\nwith which He created it, He conserves motion; not always contained in\nthe same parts of matter, but transferred from some parts to others\ndepending on the ways in which they come in contact. (Pr II 62)\n\n\nIn the Principles, Descartes conservation law only recognizes\na body\u2019s degree of motion, which correlates to the scalar\nquantity \u201cspeed\u201d, rather than the vectorial notion\n\u201cvelocity\u201d (which is speed in a given direction). This\ndistinction, between speed and velocity, surfaces in Descartes\u2019\nseven rules of impact, which spell out in precise detail the outcomes\nof bodily collisions (although these rules only describe the\ncollisions between two bodies traveling along the same straight line).\nDescartes\u2019 utilization of the concept of speed is manifest\nthroughout the rules. For example:\n\nFourth, if the body C were entirely at rest,\u2026and if\nC were slightly larger than B; the latter could\nnever have the force to move C, no matter how great the speed\nat which B might approach C. Rather, B\nwould be driven back by C in the opposite direction:\nbecause\u2026a body which is at rest puts up more resistance to high\nspeed than to low speed; and this increases in proportion to the\ndifferences in the speeds. Consequently, there would always be more\nforce in C to resist than in B to drive, \u2026.\n(Pr II 49F)\n\n\nAstonishingly, Descartes claims that a smaller body, regardless of its\nspeed, can never move a larger stationary body. While obviously\ncontradicting common experience, the fourth collision rule does nicely\ndemonstrate the scalar nature of speed, as well as the primary\nimportance of quantity of motion, in Cartesian dynamics. In this rule,\nDescartes faces the problem of preserving the total quantity of motion\nin situations distinguished by the larger body\u2019s complete rest,\nand thus zero value of quantity of motion. Descartes conserves the\njoint quantity of motion by equipping the stationary object C\nwith a resisting force sufficient to deflect the moving body\nB, a solution that does uphold the quantity of motion in\ncases where C is at rest. That is, since B merely\nchanges its direction of inertial motion, and not its size or degree\nof speed (and C equals zero throughout the interaction), the\ntotal quantity of motion of the system is preserved. For Descartes,\nreversing the direction of B\u2019s motion does not alter\nthe total quantity of motion, a conclusion that is in sharp contrast\nto the later hypothesis, usually associated with Newton and Leibniz,\nthat regards a change in direction as a negation of the initial speed\n(i.e., velocity). Thus, by failing to foresee the importance of\nconjoining direction and speed, Descartes\u2019 law falls just short\nof the modern law for the conservation of momentum.\n\nIn this context, the complex notion of \u201cdetermination\u201d\nshould be discussed, since it approximately corresponds to the\ncomposite direction of a body\u2019s quantity of motion. In some\npassages, Descartes apparently refers to the direction of a\nbody\u2019s motion as its determination: \u201cthere is a difference\nbetween motion considered in itself, and its determination in some\ndirection; this difference makes it possible for the determination to\nbe changed while the quantity of motion remains intact\u201d (Pr II\n41). Yet, a single motion does not have just one determination, as is\nclear in his critique of Hobbes\u2019 interpretation of\ndeterminations: \u201cWhat he [Hobbes] goes on to say, namely that a\n\u2018motion has only one determination,\u2019 is just like my\nsaying that an extended thing has only a single shape. Yet this does\nnot prevent the shape being divided into several components, just as\ncan be done with the determination of motion\u201d (April 21, 1641;\nAT III 356). In the same way that a particular shape can be\npartitioned into diverse component figures, so a particular\ndetermination can be decomposed into various constituent directions.\nIn his Optics, published in 1637, Descartes\u2019 derivation\nof his law of refraction seemingly endorses this interpretation of\ndeterminations. If a ball is propelled downwards from left to right at\na 45 degree angle, and then pierces a thin linen sheet, it will\ncontinue to move to the right after piercing the sheet but now at an\nangle nearly parallel with the horizon. Descartes reasons that this\nmodification of direction (from the 45 degree angle to a smaller\nangle) is the net result of a reduction in the ball\u2019s downward\ndetermination through collision with the sheet, \u201cwhile the one\n[determination] which was making the ball tend to the right must\nalways remain the same as it was, because the sheet offers no\nopposition at all to the determination in this direction\u201d (see\nFigure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Diagram from the\nOptics.\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 determination hypothesis also incorporates a certain\nquantitative element, as revealed in a further controversial\nhypothesis that is often described as the \u201cprinciple of least\nmodal action\u201d. In a letter to Clerselier (February 17th, 1645),\nDescartes explains:\n\nWhen two bodies collide, and they contain incompatible modes,\n[either different states of speed, or different determinations of\nmotion] then there must occur some change in these modes in order\nto make them compatible; but this change is always the least that may\noccur. In other words, if these modes can become compatible\nwhen a certain quantity of them is changed, then no larger quantity\nwill change (AT IV 185).\n\n\nThis principle can be illustrated with respect to our previous example\ninvolving the fourth collision rule. If both B and C\nwere to depart at the same speed and in the same direction after\nimpact, it would be necessary for the smaller body B to\ntransfer at least half of its quantity of motion to the larger\nstationary body C. Yet, Descartes reasons that it is easier\nfor B in this situation to merely reverse it direction than\nto transfer its motion:\n\nWhen C is the larger [body], B cannot push it in\nfront of itself unless it transfers to C more than half of\nits speed, together with more than half of its determination to travel\nfrom left to right in so far as this determination is linked with its\nspeed. Instead it rebounds without moving body C, and changes\nonly its whole determination, which is a smaller change than the one\nthat would come about from more than half of this determination\ntogether with more than half of its speed (AT IV 186).\n\n\nConsequently, reversing B\u2019s direction of motion, a\nchange of one mode (determination), constitutes a lesser modal change\nthan a transference of motion between two bodies, which alters two\nmodes (speed and determination). In this passage, it is important to\nnote that if B were to transfer motion to C, it\nwould change both half of B\u2019s speed and half of its\ndetermination, even though the direction of B\u2019s\nquantity of motion is preserved. As a result, a body\u2019s\ndetermination is apparently linked to its magnitude of speed.\n",
