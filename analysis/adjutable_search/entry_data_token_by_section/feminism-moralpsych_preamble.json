    "main_text": "\n\nMoral psychology, broadly construed, deals with issues relating to\nmotivation of moral action. More specifically, it concerns how we see\nor fail to see moral issues, why we act or fail to act morally, and\nwhether and to what extent we are responsible for our actions.\nFundamentally, it is concerned with our moral agency, the kind of\nbeings we are or ought to be, morally speaking.\n\nFeminist moral psychology deals with what feminists, in particular,\nhave contributed to the field of moral psychology, or the ways in\nwhich their approach to these issues is motivated by feminist\nconcerns, especially in connection to understanding and attempting to\nend women\u2019s oppression. The feminist contribution to moral\npsychology has been at least three-fold. First, some feminists\nemphasize the role of emotion in action; in particular, they stress\nthe motive of care in prompting action. They do so for the reason that\nemotion in general, and care in particular, have been ignored or\ndenigrated in traditional moral theory due to their association with\nwomen. They believe that if we are to end women\u2019s oppression, we\nshould incorporate into our philosophical theories things associated\nwith women and with the feminine and so previously left out. Other\nfeminists, though, worry about how care in particular can be harmful\nto women, and believe that incorporating care into moral theory will\nperpetuate women\u2019s oppression. Still other feminists challenge\nthe internalist thesis that motivation is necessarily present in the\nrational agent who recognizes a reason to act morally. Second,\nfeminist attention to oppression has led those feminists working in\nthe field of moral psychology to acknowledge the role of systematic\noppression in the psychology of both victims of oppression and\noppressors themselves. One issue is the role that patriarchy plays in\na person\u2019s motivation and subsequent action. How does patriarchy\naffect women\u2019s desires? Can women be autonomous if their desires\nare deformed by patriarchy? Does the satisfaction of women\u2019s\ndeformed desires contribute to their own oppression? What motivates\nthose who perform sexist acts that contribute to women\u2019s\noppression? A related issue, the third that feminists working in the\nfield of moral psychology are concerned with, is that of\nresponsibility. To what extent are we responsible for our actions when\nthey are motivated by desires deformed by patriarchy? Are victims of\noppression in any way responsible for their own oppression? Are they\nresponsible for resisting oppression? Are members of the dominant\nsocial group responsible for understanding oppression, and how can\nthey come to understand it? Are men collectively responsible for\nwomen\u2019s oppression, even when it is not the case that each man\nharbors sexist intentions? \n",
