    "main_text": "Philosophy || Moral Psychology\n3.2 Moral Psychology\n\nIn several dialogues Scud\u00e9ry examines the psychology animating\nthe moral life. This psychology consists primarily of the interplay\nbetween personal temperament, largely determined by biological\nfactors, and the personal exercise of free will. In this theory,\ntemperament shapes the moral tone of a particular personality but\nmoral character rests largely on how a moral agent exercises his or\nher personal freedom.\n\nThe variations in human personality derive largely from the different\ntemperaments human beings possess. Contrasting temperaments conceive\npain and pleasure in divergent ways; judgments concerning the worth of\na particular action or object naturally vary. \n\n\nThe diversity of temperaments causes the variations in pleasure. The\npleasures are different according to such factors as one\u2019s age\nand one\u2019s personal qualities. Ordinarily the only thing which\ndetermines this divergence are the different passions which govern the\nvarious pursuits of pleasure. [CDS, 1: 79] \n\n\nPredominantly determined by biological factors, temperament colors a\nmoral agent\u2019s distinctive perspective and inclinations toward\naction. Even the wise use of reason to discipline one\u2019s action\ncannot alter the basic temperament with which the moral agent must\nconfront ethical dilemmas.\n\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s account of temperament rests squarely on the\nclassical-medieval theory of the humors. Despite idiosyncratic\nvariations, human personality expresses four basic humors: choleric,\nmelancholic, sanguine, and phlegmatic. \n\n\nThe humors often carry the mind away and seduce it according to their\ncaprices. This is what accounts for the great diversity of sentiments\namong the most reasonable people. Without the humors, all reasonable\npeople would like equally everything meriting to be liked, whether in\nthe sciences, in the arts, or in simple pleasures. In fact, different\ntemperaments, which reflect different humors, tend to prefer different\nobjects, despite the weight of reason. This is what explains this\nvariety of emotional inclinations of which society is full.\n[CN, 2: 458] \n\n\nThis differential in humor explains how equally rational human agents\ncan have very different experiences of and judgments concerning the\nsame external object or activity. It also explains the unusual power\nof moods, such as ennui, on the moral perception and decisions of the\nhuman person.\n\nTemperament is particularly powerful in influencing the moral agent\nwhen it fabricates strong desires. Unlike ideas or even simple wishes,\ndesires rarely submit to the discipline of reason. \n\n\nWishes must be the work of reason, but desires are nearly always blind\npowers which are born from temperament. Several times in my life\nI\u2019ve had desires for several things I never wished for, because\nreason was opposed to them. [MM, 1: 344] \n\n\nThe arational empire of desire can easily motivate violent action in\nthe interest of neither the moral agent nor his or her neighbor. \n\nDespite the power of temperament, the moral agent can correct it\nthrough the use of free will. It is precisely in the emergence of free\nwill\u2019s combat against the inclinations of temperament that\npersonal moral responsibility arises. Of Inclination\ndescribes the emergence of the moral responsibility which rightly\nmerits the moral agent praise or blame for actions. \n\n\nWe are born with the inclinations which heaven was pleased to give us,\nbut we enter into the possession of praise or blame only at the moment\nwe begin to act through reason. Up to this point, nothing is truly up\nto us; after that point, we are responsible for everything we do,\nwhether good or evil. Therefore, it is up to us to see what\ninclinations we should follow and those we should change. Having known\nthe true path of glory and virtue, we should walk in it despite all\nthe repugnance we might find within ourselves. [CN, 1: 319]\n\n\n\nIn the transformation of temperament to suit the demands of the moral\norder, reason must often contradict the pull of emotions surrounding a\ndistorted humor.\n\nTo illustrate the mastery of temperament by reason, Of Anger\ndepicts the obligatory transformation of excessive anger by the agent\nwho possesses such a temperament. \n\n\nExcessive anger is the ordinary fault of all weak people. As\nrepentance is the greatest manifestation of human reason, it is\nnecessary from the earliest moments to habituate oneself to overcome a\npassion which is practically always followed and which makes the\nbearer of it hated and despised. [MM, 1: 359] \n\n\nRather than abolishing the passions, a morally mature reason\ntransforms them. In the case of a choleric temperament, the flames of\nanger are transformed into the sentiments of restraint, remorse, and\nrepentance for the damage inflected by excessive anger.\n",
