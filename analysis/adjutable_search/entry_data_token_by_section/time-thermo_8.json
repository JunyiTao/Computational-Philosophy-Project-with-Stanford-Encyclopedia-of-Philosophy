    "main_text": "The Problem of the Direction of Time II || The Thermodynamic Reduction\n3.2 The Statistical Mechanical Reduction\n\nPresumably for these reasons, contemporary theories abandon the\nattempt to ground the arrows of time on thermodynamic entropy.\nInstead, they turn to statistical mechanics, that which grounds the\nthermodynamic arrow. This more general basis is regarded as more\nfertile ground for the other arrows. In effect, the thermodynamic\narrow is just regarded as another non-basic arrow like those four\nmention above. Horwich (1987) traces the arrows back to initial\nmicro-chaos. Albert (2000, 2015) and Loewer (2012) instead trace them\nto a package dubbed the Mentaculus (after the Coen\nbrothers\u2019 film, A Serious Man, 2009). Let\u2019s\nbriefly consider how Albert and Loewer propose to derive the\nthermodynamic arrow, the epistemic arrow, and the causal arrow all\nfrom the Mentaculus.\n\nIn the Coen brothers\u2019 film, the character Arthur Gopnik, a\nmathematician, spends his days on a couch filling a notebook with a\nprobability map of the universe, the Mentaculus. It is an apt name for\nwhat statistical mechanics provides us according to Albert and Loewer.\nIn effect, it provides us with a probability map for every macroscopic\ngeneralization because it provides probabilities over all the\nmicrostates realizing these macrostates. The package is composed of\nthe following elements: the past hypothesis (that the entropy of\ninitial macrostate \\(M(0)\\) is extremely low), a uniform probability\ndistribution over the microstates that realize \\(M(0)\\), the present\nmacrostate \\(M(t)\\), and the dynamical laws of the microlevel.\n\nThis package, they say, implies the thermodynamic arrow. We\n\u201cderive\u201d it from basic physics by making a case at time\n\\(t\\) that \n\\[ P(S \\text{ increases } \\mid M(t) \\amp M(0) \\amp\n\\text{uniform-probability-over-}M(0)) = \\text{high} \\]\n\n\nBoltzmann, Gibbs and many others make the case, although it\u2019s\nworth bearing in mind that they do so rigorously only in ideal cases\nand much remains controversial (see above). Still, it strikes many as\nphysically plausible. One could say a lot more, but let\u2019s grant\nthis. Then notice that the first problem of the direction of time is\nblocked by the Past Hypothesis. One conditionalizes on the uniform\ndistribution given \\(M(0)\\) and \\(M(t)\\), not merely \\(M(t)\\). The\nconstraint at one end of the universe makes the claim that earlier\nentropy was higher unlikely. If correct, we have an honest-to-goodness\nreduction of a special science law \u201cthe second law of\nthermodynamics\u201d from the bottom.\n\nBut this package also implies more. Turn to the causal arrow. As a\nvery rough first approximation, causation can be analyzed\nprobabilistically. Cause \\(C\\) causes effect \\(E\\) just in case \\(C\\)\nis prior to \\(E\\) and the probability of \\(E\\) given \\(C\\) and\nbackground \\(B\\) is greater than the probability of \\(E\\) given \\(B\\)\nalone. Of course, there are major problems with this account (see the\nentry on Probabilistic Causation). Yet the core intuition appears to\ncome from the package, as one gets the temporal priority of causes\nfrom the Past Hypothesis and the probabilities from statistical\nmechanics. Together, they are claimed to explain why we can manipulate\ncauses to produce effects but not vice versa. Turn to the epistemic\narrow. Reflect on the nature of records. When you weigh yourself on a\nscale, one produces a record of one\u2019s weight. This record is\nbased on an inference comparing the states of the scale at two\ndifferent times. I\u2019m (say) 180 lbs if the scale was in its\nfunctioning ready state at 0 lbs before I stepped on it. The idea,\nvery loosely (see Albert 2000, 2015 and Loewer 2012 for the details)\nis that the Past Hypothesis effectively is the world\u2019s Ready\nState. This highly constrained state is what causes there to be\nmacroscopic traces of the past in the present but not macroscopic\ntraces of the future in the present.\n\nNaturally, this ambitious program met with vigorous criticism. The\nidea that statistical mechanics implies (probabilistically) the truth\nor falsity of virtually every counterfactual-supporting generalization\nin all of science and everyday life strikes many as going too far. See\nCallender and Cohen 2010, Earman 2006, Frisch 2010, Leeds 2003, North\n2011, Westlake 2014, Winsberg 2004 and some essays in Wilson 2014.\n\nLong ago Boltzmann (e.g., 1895) suggested that the temporal\nasymmetries discussed above are explained by the direction of\nincreasing entropy. A lot of progress has been made developing this\ntantalizing thesis. Nevertheless, just as work on the first problem of\nthe origins of the thermodynamic arrow remains active, so too does\nresearch on the second.\n",
