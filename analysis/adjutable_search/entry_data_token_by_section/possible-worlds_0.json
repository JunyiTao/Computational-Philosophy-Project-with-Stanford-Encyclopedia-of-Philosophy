    "main_text": "Possible Worlds and Modal Logic\n1. Possible Worlds and Modal Logic\n\nAlthough \u2018possible world\u2019 has been part of the\nphilosophical lexicon at least since Leibniz, the notion became firmly\nentrenched in contemporary philosophy with the development of\npossible world semantics for the languages of propositional and\nfirst-order modal logic. In addition to the usual sentence operators\nof\n classical logic\n such as \u2018and\u2019 (\u2018\u2227\u2019), \u2018or\u2019\n(\u2018\u2228\u2019), \u2018not\u2019 (\u2018\u00ac\u2019),\n\u2018if...then\u2019 (\u2018\u2192\u2019), and, in the\nfirst-order case, the quantifiers \u2018all\u2019\n(\u2018\u2200\u2019) and \u2018some\u2019\n(\u2018\u2203\u2019), these languages contain operators intended to\nrepresent the modal adverbs \u2018necessarily\u2019\n(\u2018\u25a1\u2019) and \u2018possibly\u2019\n(\u2018\u25c7\u2019). Although a prominent aspect of logic in both\nAristotle's work and the work of many medieval philosophers, modal\nlogic was largely ignored from the modern period to the mid-20th\ncentury. And even though a variety of modal deductive systems had in\nfact been rigorously developed in the early 20th century, notably by\nLewis and Langford (1932), there was for the languages of those\nsystems nothing comparable to the elegant semantics that Tarski had\nprovided for the languages of classical first-order logic.\nConsequently, there was no rigorous account of what it means for a\nsentence in those languages to be true and, hence, no account\nof the critical semantic notions of validity and logical consequence\nto underwrite the corresponding deductive notions of theoremhood and\nprovability. A concomitant philosophical consequence of this void in\nmodal logic was a deep skepticism, voiced most prominently by Quine,\ntoward any appeal to modal notions in metaphysics generally, notably,\nthe notion of an essential property. (See Quine 1953 and 1956, and the\nappendix to Plantinga 1974.) The purpose of the following two\nsubsections is to provide a simple and largely ahistorical overview of\nhow possible world semantics fills this void; the final subsection\npresents two important applications of the semantics. (Readers\nfamiliar with basic possible world semantics can skip to \u00a72 with\nno significant loss of continuity.) \n",
