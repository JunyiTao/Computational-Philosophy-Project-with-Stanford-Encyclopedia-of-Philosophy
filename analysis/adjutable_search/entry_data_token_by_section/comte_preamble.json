    "main_text": "\n\nAuguste Comte (1798\u20131857) is the founder of positivism, a\nphilosophical and political movement which enjoyed a very wide\ndiffusion in the second half of the nineteenth century. It sank into\nan almost complete oblivion during the twentieth, when it was eclipsed\nby neopositivism. However, Comte\u2019s decision to develop\nsuccessively a philosophy of mathematics, a philosophy of physics, a\nphilosophy of chemistry and a philosophy of biology, makes him the\nfirst philosopher of science in the modern sense, and his constant\nattention to the social dimension of science resonates in many\nrespects with current points of view. His political philosophy, on the\nother hand, is even less known, because it differs substantially from\nthe classical political philosophy we have inherited.\n\nComte\u2019s most important works are (1) the Course on Positive\nPhilosophy (1830\u20131842, six volumes, translated and\ncondensed by Harriet Martineau as The Positive Philosophy of\nAuguste Comte); (2) the System of Positive Polity, or\nTreatise on Sociology, Instituting the Religion of Humanity,\n(1851\u20131854, four volumes); and (3) the Early Writings\n(1820\u20131829), where one can see the influence of Saint-Simon, for\nwhom Comte served as secretary from 1817 to 1824. The Early\nWritings are still the best introduction to Comte\u2019s\nthought. In the Course, Comte said, science was transformed\ninto philosophy; in the System, philosophy was transformed\ninto religion. The second transformation met with strong opposition;\nas a result, it has become customary to distinguish, with Mill,\nbetween a \u201cgood Comte\u201d (the author of the Course)\nand a \u201cbad Comte\u201d (the author of the System).\nToday\u2019s common conception of positivism corresponds mainly to\nwhat can be found in the Course.\n",
