But that is regarded as a contentious\nstandpoint by some theater and performance theorists. And the\ndistinction between theater and performance, even if only alleged, has\nbeen a growing concern in theater studies and performance theories\nsince at least the beginnings of the twentieth century, when Spingarn\nand Matthews debated whether one should emphasize either the\n\u201ctheatricality\u201d of theater or the adherence of a\nperformance to a written script (Matthews 1910; Spingarn 1911 [1931]).\nTheir debate concerned text-based theater, and they each thought of\n\u201cperformance\u201d in terms of theatrical performances\nof texts. But the wrinkle is that if there is a profound\ndifference between performance as an art and theater as\nan art, then before one can describe an instance of theater, one\nhas to know it is one and not an instance of performance art\ninstead.\n\nDespite the differences in the background thinking used in developing\ntheir theories, some theater studies and performance theorists have\nnevertheless held one view in common, namely, that there is a distinct\ndifference between acting and performance. Roughly that difference has\nbeen explained this way: when acting one is not being oneself, but one\nis being oneself when performing. This has turned out to be a troubled\nexplanation. For what then are we to say about the actor in a\nplay\u2014the real, flesh and blood actor (Auslander 1986\n [2002])?[1]\n\nA leading approach to this problem in theater studies and performance\ntheory relies on anthropological investigations into ritual, turning\nthem into a theory of performance that distinguishes between the\nrole of performer and the role of actor as\nexhibiting different kinds of human behavior (Turner 1982; Schechner\n1988). This way of distinguishing between the practice of theater and\nthe practice of performance has been persuasive to some theater and\nperformance theorists because of a feature of the avant garde\ntheater practices in the traditions of Antonin Artaud and Jerzy\nGrotowski (Artaud 1938 [1958]; Grotowski 1968 [2002]). It is alleged\nthat in those practices the actor seeks to be, or at least to appear\nto be, metaphysically present to the\nspectator\u2014appearing to speak spontaneously even when scripted,\nappearing to have authority in the theater about the direction of the\nplot, again even when scripted, and appearing to deliver words that\nare meant, perhaps unambiguously, and could be taken as\nthough spontaneously delivered. In the latter case especially, actors\nre-enforced what theorists following Derrida called\n\u201clogocentrism\u201d. In contrast, some theorists held the\nperformer (the non-actor) is free to be, as it were,\n\u201cabsent\u201d (Fuchs 1986).\n\nResponding to the challenge posed by these proposals, and noting both\nthe absence of any definition of performance and any attention to the\nhistorical facts about the ways the relevant practices actually\ndeveloped (see\n \u00a73.1\n below), it has been argued that the most plausible way to\ncharacterize \u201cperformance\u201d has its roots in standard\nethnological and ethological theories, and characterizes\n\u201cperformance\u201d as a kind of \u201cdisplay behavior\u201d\nthat is exhibited by members of various species, including our own\n(Hamilton 2013). In this account, however, performance is not an\nalternative to acting but more like acting\u2019s \u201cgenus\u201d\nto which it corresponds as a \u201cspecies\u201d.\n\nIf right, this would dissolve the issues raised among performance and\ntheater theorists. For rather than being different kinds of human\nbehavior, they would be modeled as the same kind, but with different\nscope. However this proposal confronts a robust history of thought to\nthe contrary, conflicts with a sizable amount of the common discourses\namong theater and performance artists themselves, and challenges the\nleading theory of acting among those philosophers and cognitive\nscientists who study the phenomena of pretense and imagination, and\nwho either might or do think of acting as pretending rather than as\ndisplay behavior (Searle 1975; Lewis 1978; Harris et al. 1993;\nKavanaugh and Harris 1999; Nicholls and Stitch 2000; Goldstein and\nBloom 2011; Brown 2017).\n",
