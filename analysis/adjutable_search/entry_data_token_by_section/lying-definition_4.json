    "main_text": "Traditional Definition of Lying || Intention to Deceive the Addressee Condition\n1.4 Intention to Deceive the Addressee Condition\n\n\nAccording to the intention to deceive the addressee condition, lying\nrequires that a person make an untruthful statement to another person\nwith the intention that that other person believe that\nuntruthful statement to be true. Making ironic statements, telling jokes,\nwriting fiction, acting in a play, and so forth, without the\nintention that the addressee believe these untruthful statements to be\ntrue, is not lying (Morris 1976, 391).\n\n\nIf x makes an untruthful statement to y,\nwithout the intention that y believe that untruthful\nstatement to be true, but with the intention that y\nbelieve something else to be true that x\nbelieves to be true, then x is not lying to\ny, according to L1. Examples of such non-deceptive untruthful\nstatements include polite untruths (Kant 1997, 27; Mahon 2003,\n109). For example, if servant Igor makes the untruthful statement to\nunwelcome visitor Damian, \u201cMadam is not at home,\u201d\nwithout the intention that Damian believe it to be true that\nshe is not home (that would be lying on Igor\u2019s part), but\nwith the intention that Damian believe it to be true that it\nis inconvenient for Madam to see Damian now, something that Igor\nbelieves to be true, then according to L1, Igor is not lying to Damian\n(Isenberg 1973, 256). However, for Igor to intend that Damian believe\nthis, it must be the case that Igor believes that this is how\nDamian understands \u201cMadam is not at home.\u201d Polite untruths\nmay be said to be examples of \u201cfalsifications but not\nlies,\u201d since the person \u201csays just what etiquette\ndemands\u201d (Shiffrin 2014, 19). As it has been said about\nuntruthful statements situations \u201cin which politeness requires\nsome sort of remark\u201d and the other person \u201cknows quite well\nthat the statement is false,\u201d such statements \u201care not\nreally lies\u201d (Coleman and Kay 1981, 29). They are better\nconsidered as cases of speaking in code. Another example of a\nnon-deceptive untruthful statement is what has been called an\n\u201caltruistic lie\u201d (Fallis 2009, 50; cf. Augustine\n1952, 57), such as when a speaker makes an untruthful statement to a\nhearer whom he believes distrusts him, in order that the hearer will\nbelieve something that the speaker believes to be true.\nThis is not a lie according to L1.\n\n\nSuch non-deceptive untruths are not to be confused with white\nlies, i.e., harmless lies (Bok 1978, 58; Sweetser 1987, 54; 52 n.\n73) or prosocial lies (also called social lies),\ni.e., lies that do not harm social life but protect it (Meibauer 2014,\n152; Sweetser 1987, 54), or fibs, i.e., inconsequential lies\ntold for selfish reasons (Sweetser 1987, 54). White lies, prosocial\nlies, and fibs are all intentionally deceptive, and are all lies\naccording to L1 (Green 2001, 169). For example, \u201cboth American\nand Ecuadorian cultures would probably consider Jacobo\u2019s reply\nto be a white lie,\u201d and hence deceptive, in the following case\npresented to Ecuadorians by linguists: \u201cTeresa just bought a new\ndress. Upon trying it on for the first time, she asks her husband\nJacobo, \u2018Does it look good on me?\u2019 Jacobo responds,\n\u2018Yes\u2019 even though he really thinks that the dress is ugly\nand too tight\u201d (Hardin 2010, 3207; cf. Dynel 2011, 160). Or, to\ntake another example, \u201cSome people would call it a white lie to\ntell a dying person whatever he or she needs to hear to die in\npeace\u201d (Sweetser 1987, 54). Note that both white lies and\nprosocial lies are to be distinguished from \u201clies which most\npeople would think justified by some higher good achieved but which\nwould not be called white lies [or prosocial lies], since their\ninformational consequences are too major (however moral),\u201d such\nas \u201cto lie to the Gestapo about the location of a Jew\u201d\n(Sweetser 1987, 54).\n\n\nAccording to the untruthfulness condition, it is not merely the case\nthat the person who makes the untruthful statement intends that some\nother person believe the untruthful statement to be true; the person\nintends that the addressee believe the untruthful statement\nto be true. Also, according to this condition, it is not merely the\ncase that the person intends that the addressee believe some statement\nto be true that the person believes to be false; the person intends\nthat the addressee believe to be true the untruthful statement\nthat is made to the addressee. If Maximilian is a crime boss, and\nAlessandro is one of his henchmen, whom he secretly believes is a\npolice informant, and Maximilian makes the untruthful statement to\nAlessandro \u201cThere are no informants in my organization,\u201d\nwithout the intention that Alessandro believe that statement to be\ntrue, but with the intention that Alessandro believe that\nMaximilian believes that statement to be true, then\nMaximilian is not lying according to L1 (Mahon 2008, 220). (Maximilian\nhas, of course, attempted to deceive Alessandro). This conclusion has\nprompted some to revise L1 to include more than one intention to\ndeceive.\n\n\nAccording to the untruthfulness condition, it is sufficient for lying that the\nperson who makes the untruthful statement intends that the\naddressee believe the untruthful statement to be true; it is not\nnecessary that the addressee believe the untruthful statement to be\ntrue. That is, a lie remains a lie if it is disbelieved. If\nSophie makes the untruthful statement to Nicole \u201cI didn\u2019t\nget any homework today,\u201d with the intention that Nicole believe\nthat statement to be true, and if Nicole does not believe that\nstatement to be true, then Sophie is still lying. This is because\n\u2018lie\u2019 is not an achievement or success verb, and an act of\nlying is not a perlocutionary act. The existence of an act of lying\ndoes not depend upon the production of a particular response or state\nin the addressee (Mannison 1969, 135; Wood 1973: 199; MacCormick 1983,\n9 n. 23; but see Reboul 1994). As it has been said, \u201cIt is very\nodd to think that whether a speaker lies\nhinges upon the persuasiveness of the speaker or the credulity\nof the listener\u201d (Shiffrin 2014, 13).\n\n\nBecause L1 does not have an assertion condition, however, according to\nL1 it is possible to lie by making ironic statements, telling jokes,\nwriting fiction, acting in a play, and so forth, if the person making\nthe untruthful statement (somehow) intends that it be believed to be\ntrue, as in the case of the \u2018irony lie\u2019 above. Similarly,\nif someone intends to deceive using a joke\u2014for example, if con\nartist David says \u201cYeah, I am a billionaire. That's why I am in\nthis dive\u201d to his mark, Greg, at a bar, intending that Greg\nbelieve that David is a billionaire who is attempting to to pass\nincognito in a bar\u2014then this \u2018joke lie\u2019 is a lie\naccording to L1. If a novelist were to write a novel with the\nintention that her audience believe that this was a true story\ndisguised as a novel\u2014a pretend roman \u00e0 \nclef\u2014then this \u2018fiction lie\u2019 would be a lie according\nto L1. If an actor in a play were to deliver an untruthful statement\nwith the intention that his audience believe the statement to be \ntrue\u2014say, if an an actor delivered a line about his life being too\nshort with the intention that the audience believed that the actor\nwas actually dying from some disease (\u201cit is possible that the\nperformance is part of an elaborate deception aimed at getting members\nof the audience to believe that the particular line from the play is\nactually true\u201d (Fallis 2009, 56))\u2014then this\n\u2018acting lie\u2019 would be a lie according to L1. \n",
