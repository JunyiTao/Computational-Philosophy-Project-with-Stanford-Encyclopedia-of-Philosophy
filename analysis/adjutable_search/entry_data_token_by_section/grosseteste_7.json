    "main_text": "Modality and God\u2019s Power\n8.  Modality and God\u2019s Power\nWhen Grosseteste wrote On Free Decision modal concepts were\ntypically understood in terms of the notion of change and thus of\ntime. Thus, Grosseteste speaks of a necessary proposition, in this\nsense, as one that is true and cannot become false, or as one\nwhose truth is unable to cease to be. A contingent proposition\ncan change its truth value; a possible proposition, if false, can\nbecome true, and an impossible proposition is false and cannot become\ntrue. Conceptions of modality along these lines were sometimes\ndescribed as per accidens conceptions, since in many cases a\nproposition\u2019s modal status could change with the passage of time; its\nmodal status, as it were, happens to or is incidental to it\n(accidit).  \u201cCaesar crossed the Rubicon,\u201d for\nexample, was once false and not necessary, but became true and\nnecessary, because unable to become false, after Caesar crossed the\nRubicon. Indeed, true propositions about the past were the standard\nexamples of propositions necessary in the sense that their truth\ncannot cease. \nGrosseteste holds that true propositions about the present may well\nbe contingent on this conception of contingency, since they can become\nfalse; he gives \u201cSocrates is pale\u201d as an example (Lewis\n2017, 41).  But he holds that all true propositions about the future\nare necessary.  It might be thought that this is incorrect, since it\nis not hard to think of cases in which a true proposition about the\nfuture becomes false after the occurrence of an event it predicts.\nBut closer inspection reveals that Grosseteste thinks that true\npropositions about the future are necessary because they cannot become\nfalse prior to the obtaining of the state of affairs they are\nabout; he has a limited unchangeability of truth in mind.\nGrosseteste does not reject this conception of per accidens\nmodalities.  Rather, he introduces another family of modal notions\nunconnected to considerations of time or change, a family of\nnon-temporal modal notions. And he holds that many true propositions\nabout the future, including those about future free acts, are\ncontingent in the sense of contingency belonging to this family, as\nindeed also are true propositions regarding God\u2019s knowledge of those\nacts, past prophecies of them or even statements to the effect that it\nwas the case that the acts would occur.  Ideas along these lines, we\nmay note, were not original to Grosseteste; they are implicit\nin some of his predecessors, such as Peter Lombard, whom\nGrosseteste cites. But they, unlike Grosseteste, had not attempted to\nwork out in any detail a theory of modality severing a link\nwith considerations of time and change (the twelfth-century thinker,\nPeter Abelard, is an exception, but his theory of non-temporal\nmodality, which takes as its central notion that of a thing\u2019s nature,\nis very different from Grosseteste\u2019s and had little\ninfluence). Thinkers after Grosseteste, such as Duns Scotus, developed\naccounts of non-temporal modality in even more detail that share\nelements found in Grosseteste\u2019s account and were perhaps influenced by\nit (see Lewis 1996).\nThe guiding idea behind Grosseteste\u2019s approach to a notion of\nnon-temporal contingency is that even if a proposition such as\n\u201cAntichrist will exist\u201d (to use his standard example of a\ntrue, future contingent proposition) is true now and cannot become\nfalse until Antichrist comes into existence, the world might\nnevertheless have been such that \u201cAntichrist will exist\u201d\nwas never true.  A present-day thinker might spell this idea out in\nterms of alternative possible worlds, but Grosseteste spells it out in\nterms of the notion of a proposition\u2019s eternal power or capacity for truth or\nfalsity without beginning, and grounds such powers ultimately in God\u2019s\neternal power to know or will propositions.\nGrosseteste\u2019s discussion of non-temporal modalities and their\nrelation to God\u2019s power is most fully set out in the earlier\nrecension of On Free Decision.  Focusing on necessity, he\nwrites that \u201csomething is called necessary in that it has no\ncapacity, either not to be, or not to have been, or not to be going to\nbe. [The dictum] \u2018that two and three are five\u2019 is\nnecessary in this sense, because it has no capacity not to be true in\nthe present, or in the future, or in the past, or ever, be it with or\nwithout a beginning\u201d (Lewis 2017, 39,41). He goes on to describe\nthe corresponding notion of contingency as a matter of a\nproposition\u2019s having \u201ca capacity for being true and being\nfalse without a beginning.\u201d What is necessary in this sense\nutterly lacks a power to be false. What is contingent, in the\ncorresponding sense, could have had from the beginning a different\ntruth-value, though it may well lack a power to change its truth-value\nfrom that which it actually has. Grosseteste holds that this kind of\ncontingency of propositions about future events or things implies that\nthe things or events the proposition is about may themselves be called\ncontingent, and that this kind of contingency is sufficient for the\nfreedom of our future acts.\nMuch of Grosseteste\u2019s account of modality is concerned with\ndifficulties posed by the notion of the eternal power of a proposition\nto be true or false without beginning. He seems to hold such powers to\nbe possessed not in time, but in eternity. He notes that God too has\neternal powers, namely to know or will without beginning, and that the\ndifficulties confronting the eternal powers of propositions also\nconfront the eternal powers of God. In fact, Grosseteste explains the\neternal powers of propositions in terms of God\u2019s eternal powers\nto know and will propositions, effectively grounding non-temporal\nmodality in God\u2019s powers or lack thereof (in the case of\nnecessity and impossibility). He notes, for example, that \u201cthe\neternal capacity for [the dictum] \u2018that Antichrist was\ngoing to exist\u2019 to have had truth and not to have had truth\nwithout a beginning is nothing but the capacity of God by which God\nwas able from eternity and without a beginning to will or not to will\nthat Antichrist will exist, or to know or not to know that Antichrist\nwill exist\u201d (Lewis 2017, 55).\n The difficulties facing the notion of eternal powers stem from the\nidea that there are unexercised but nonetheless genuine eternal\npowers, as Grosseteste\u2019s account of non-temporal contingency seems to\nrequire.  Put in terms of God\u2019s powers to know or will, one problem is\nwhat it could mean to say that God could have not known or\nwilled what he in fact knows or wills (or the converse), as is\nimplied, Grosseteste thinks, by the doctrine that God has the power to\nnot know or not will what he knows or wills.  For \u201ccould\nhave\u201d expresses the priority of power to act, the idea that\nprior to God\u2019s willing that p, he had a power not to will that p. But\nGod is not in time and thus \u201ccould have\u201d cannot express a\ntemporal priority of God\u2019s power to its act.  Grosseteste\u2019s solution\nto this problem is to hold that it expresses a so-called causal\npriority, a notion he drew from Eriugena (Grosseteste prefers not to\ncall it a natural priority since there is no distinction of natures\ninvolved in God\u2019s power and act) (see Lewis 1996).\n The notion of unexercised eternal powers also faces the difficulty\nthat unexercised powers appear to be powers for future acts and, if\ngenuine, can be exercised in the future.  But how could a timeless\nbeing, as God is, exercise at a future time his power to know or will\nwhat he in fact does not know or will; indeed, are not such powers\ndescribed as powers to know or will without beginning? Such\nan attribution of power to God therefore seems to be empty\n(frustra).  The problem Grosseteste confronts here is central\nto anyone who, like him, takes God to be timeless and yet to have\npowers to do what he does not do, and it is to Grosseteste\u2019s credit\nthat he puts the problem squarely on the table. His solution appeals\nto the idea that God\u2019s powers to know or will are rational powers,\npowers that can be exercised in more than one way (the concept of a\nrational power is drawn from Aristotle).  Thus the power to know that\np is the same as the power to not-know that p. But\ngiven such a conception of power, if God knows that p, then\nhis power to not-know that p is ipso facto\nexercised, since it is the very same power as the power to know that\np. So there are no unexercised powers in God after\nall. Thomas Bradwardine noted in criticism of this account that a more\nplausible requirement on exercisability is that if an agent has a\npower to know that p and does not know that p, then\nhe can exercise that power by knowing that p.  Grosseteste\nhas no reply to this objection; its answer would require a more\nthoroughgoing examination of the relation of power to time and change\nthan Grosseteste gives (see Lewis 1996).\n",
