    "main_text": "The Problem of Evil\n5. The Problem of Evil\n\nThe arguments of Hume\u2019s that we have considered so far may all\nbe described as sceptical arguments that are critical of efforts to\nprove the existence of God. No argument considered so far aims to\nprove that God does not or cannot exist. However, in the\nDialogues Hume considers an ancient argument based on the\nexistence of evil that is intended to establish this negative\nconclusion. It comes in the form of \u201cEpicurus\u2019s old\nquestions\u201d which remain \u201cunanswered\u201d (D, 10.25/198).\nThe questions are these: Is God willing to prevent evil but unable to\ndo so? Then he is not omnipotent. Is God able to prevent evil but\nunwilling to do so? Then he is malevolent (or at least less than\nperfectly good). If God is both willing and able to prevent evil then\nwhy is there evil in the world? (See the entry on the\n problem of evil.)\n What is at stake here is the possibility of vindicating God\u2019s\nmoral attributes in face of the existence of evil in this world. It is\nclear, as Cleanthes acknowledges, that if this cannot be done then the\ncase for theism in any traditional form will collapse (D,\n10.28/199).\n\nSeveral different strategies are available to the theist to defuse\nthis problem \u2014 that is, theodicies of various kinds. One\nstrategy is to deny the reality of evil and insist that the evils we\nexperience or observe in the world are really \u201cgoods to the\nuniverse\u201d which are essential for a perfectly good whole. In\nother words, these are only evils relative to our individual, narrow,\nhuman perspective. From the divine perspective, viewing the universe\nas one system, the removal of such ills or afflictions would produce\ngreater ill or diminish the total amount of good in the world. This\nstrategy may be interpreted as arguing either that there are no real\nevils in the world (i.e., only apparent evils) or that there are real\nevils in the world but they are all necessary evils \u2014 without\nwhich the whole system of nature would not be so perfect (Cp. D,\n10.5\u20137/194; EU, 8.34/101).\n\nIn respect of the first view, that there is no real evil, Hume takes\nthe view that it is plainly contrary to human experience. The reality\nof the distinction between good and evil \u2014 whether physical or\nmoral \u2014 depends on \u201cthe natural sentiments of the human\nmind\u201d. These distinctions, based on feeling, cannot be altered\nor amended \u201cby any philosophical theory or speculation\nwhatsoever\u201d (EU, 8.34\u20135/101\u201303). In the\nDialogues Hume opens his discussion of the problem of evil by\nhaving Philo (the sceptic) run through a long catalogue of the variety\nand extent of misery and suffering in this world. He begins with\nanimal suffering of various kinds (the strong preying on the weak\netc.) and moves on to human suffering in its numerous forms (illness,\nemotional torments, war etc.). Even religion (i.e.,\n\u201csuperstition\u201d) is a source of fear and anxiety. Despite\nthis catalogue of human suffering and grief, we find ourselves too\nafraid of death to put an end to our miserable existence. \u201cWe\nare terrified, not bribed to the continuance of our existence.\u201d\n(D, 10.17/197) The conclusion that Philo draws from all this is that\n\u201cthe course of nature tends not to human or animal\nfelicity\u201d \u2013which brings us back to \u201cEpicurus\u2019s\nold questions\u201d (D, 10.25/198).\n\nThe first line of reply to this comes from Demea (the mystic) who\nargues that \u201cthe present evil phenomena \u2026 are rectified\nin other regions, and in some future period of existence\u201d (D,\n10.29/199). This is a view that is immediately corrected by Cleanthes\nalong similar lines to those that Hume also presents in the first\nEnquiry. The problem here is that if we grant, with Demea,\nthe reality of evil in this world then in so far as our understanding\nof God\u2019s attributes is based on the evidence of his creation in\nthis world, we are in no position to infer the \u201cperfect goodness\nof the Deity\u201d.\n\nNow without some such license of supposition, it is impossible for us\nto argue from the cause, or infer any alteration in the effect, beyond\nwhat has immediately fallen under our observation. Greater good\nproduced by this Being must still prove a greater degree of goodness:\na more impartial distribution of rewards and punishments must proceed\nfrom a greater regard to justice and equity. Every supposed addition\nto the works of nature makes an addition to the attributes of the\nAuthor of nature; and consequently, being entirely unsupported by any\nreason or argument, can never be admitted but as a mere conjecture and\nhypothesis. (EU, 11.26/ 145)\n\n\nHume\u2019s point is not that the reality of evil proves that God\ncannot be both omnipotent and perfectly good but that we are in no\nposition to claim that we know that God will \u201crectify\u201d the\nevil of this world (e.g., its unjust distribution of good and evil) in\na future state, since the evidence of this world does not support such\na conjecture. Our predicament is like that of a person who stands in\nthe porch that leads into a very different building or structure and\nmust conjecture what the complete or whole plan is like. We may hope\nor imagine that something better awaits us but the present phenomena\ndo not license a conjecture or hypothesis of this kind (EU, 11.21,24/\n141,143).\n\nFaced with this difficulty, Cleanthes insists that contrary to all\nthat Philo and Demea have claimed, we must allow that there is more\nhappiness than misery, more pleasure than pain, in this world. Failing\nthis, \u201cthere is an end at once of all religion\u201d (D,\n10.28/199). Philo\u2019s response is that this is a fatal concession.\nNot only will it be hard to prove that there is more happiness than\nmisery in the world, much more than this is needed to vindicate\nGod\u2019s moral attributes. Unless all evil is essential or\nnecessary the religious position will collapse. Any degree or kind of\nunnecessary evil \u2014 however small \u2014 would tell against the\nexistence of God as an infinitely powerful and perfectly good being.\nThe usual reply to this (echoing God\u2019s answer to Job) is that we\nhumans are in no position to tell whether there is any unnecessary\nevil in this world \u2013for all we know, all the evil in this world\nis indeed necessary evil. It is arrogance to question God\u2019s\nexistence and goodness when we lack understanding of the infinite\ncomplexities of his creation.\n\nThe central thrust of Hume\u2019s discussion of evil in the\nDialogues is to show that this kind of theodicy fails.\n\nI will allow, that pain or misery in man is compatible with\ninfinite power and goodness in the Deity, even in your sense of these\nattributes: What have you advanced by all these concessions? A mere\npossible compatibility is not sufficient. You must prove these pure\nunmixed, and uncontrollable attributes from the present mixed and\nconfused phenomena, and from these alone. (D,10.35/201)\n\n\nPhilo goes on to point out that even if the phenomena of nature were\n\u201cpure and unmixed\u201d (i.e., entirely good) they are still\nfinite and so insufficient to prove God\u2019s infinite perfection\nand goodness. The phenomena of nature are, in any case, not only\nfinite, they are a mixture of good and evil, so any effort to prove\nGod\u2019s \u201cinfinite power and goodness\u201d on this basis is\na hopeless task. Here Philo claims to \u201ctriumph\u201d (D,\n10.36/201). Further on, Philo returns to this point.\n\n\u2026 as this goodness is not antecedently established, but must be\ninferred from the phenomena, there can be no grounds for such an\ninference, while there are so many ills in the universe, and while\nthese ills might so easily have been remedied, as far as human\nunderstanding can be allowed to judge on such a subject. I am sceptic\nenough to allow, that the bad appearances, notwithstanding all my\nreasonings, may be compatible with such attributes as you suppose: But\nsurely they can never prove these attributes. (D, 11.12/211)\n\n\nClearly, then, the task required of traditional theism cannot be to\nestablish merely the possibility that the existence of evil is\nconsistent with God\u2019s existence, it is to explain how we can\ninfer God\u2019s infinite power and goodness on the basis of our\nexperience of finite phenomena that presents us with a mixture of good\nand evil in this world. It is this task, Philo maintains, that\nCleanthes has failed to perform.\n\nThe subtlety of Hume\u2019s argument is now clear. There is no need\nfor the sceptic to launch a strong argument that aims to prove that\nGod cannot exist on the basis of the real existence of evil in this\nworld. All that the sceptic needs to do is to show that the theist is\nunable to prove or establish God\u2019s attributes of infinite power\nand goodness given the evidence of creation as we observe it. What the\ntheist must do, in order to meet this challenge, is to show that all\nthe evil that exists in this world (i.e., every last degree and\nmeasure of it) is necessary and unavoidable. It is clear that the\ntheist is in no position to support this claim. The mere possibility\nthat this is the case will not suffice to justify the inference to\nGod\u2019s infinite power and goodness. We cannot, therefore,\nestablish God\u2019s moral attributes along the lines that Cleanthes\nhas suggested.\n\nHume\u2019s \u201cconcession\u201d that evil and God\u2019s\nexistence are compatible may have the appearance of (another)\n\u201cretreat\u201d from a stronger sceptical position. The\nsignificance of this concession should not be exaggerated. While the\nsceptic cannot prove that there does indeed exist some unnecessary\nevil in the world, it is nevertheless possible to show that this view\nof things is in no way unreasonable. Hume describes a fourfold\ncatalogue of causes of evil in this world none of which \u201cappear\nto human reason, in the least degree, necessary or unavoidable\u201d\n(D, 11.5/205). He asks, for example, why animal creation is not\nanimated entirely by pleasure, as it appears \u201cplainly possible\nto carry on the business of life without any pain\u201d (D,\n11.6/206). Similarly, why could God not have been more generous in\nproviding his creatures with better endowments for their survival and\nhappiness (i.e., why is God not more of an \u201cindulgent\nparent\u201d)? (D, 11.9/208) Again, why does nature run into such\nextremes in relation to heat and cold, rains, winds, and so on? Surely\nthings could have been arranged so that these extremes and their\ndestructive consequences could be avoided? Finally, Hume asks why God\ndoes not act through particular volitions to prevent specific\ncatastrophes and disasters (e.g., why not ensure there is no storm\nblowing when a fleet is out at sea)? (D,11.8/206) In all these cases,\nHume grants, there may \u201cbe good reasons, why providence\ninterposes not in this manner; but they are unknown to us\u201d (D,\n11.8/207). The implication of all this is not just that we have no\nreason to infer the existence of an infinitely powerful and good God\nbut that we have considerable reason for doubting it.\n\nGiven these considerations regarding the causes of evil, and the\nlimits of human understanding, what is the most reasonable hypothesis\nconcerning the first cause of the universe? Philo dismisses the\nsuggestion that the first cause is either perfectly good or perfectly\nmalevolent on the ground that \u201cmixed phenomena\u201d can never\nprove either of the unmixed principles as the first cause. This leaves\nonly two other possibilities. Either the first cause has both goodness\nand malice or it has neither. Philo argues that the steady and orderly\nnature of the world suggests that no such (Manichean)\n\u201ccombat\u201d between good and evil is going on. So the most\nplausible hypothesis is that \u201cthe original source of all\nthings\u201d is just as indifferent about \u201cgood above\nill\u201d as it is about heat above cold (D, 11.14/211\u20132).\nNature is blind and uncaring regarding such matters and there is no\nbasis for the supposition that the world has been created with human\nor animal happiness or comfort in mind. Any supposition of this kind\nis nothing better than an anthropomorphic prejudice (EU, 11.27/146;\ncp. D, 10.31/200).\n\nThe tendency of Hume\u2019s discussion of evil, in both the\nEnquiry and Dialogues, is to insist on the reality\nof evil and the doubts that this casts on any claim that the beauty,\nharmony and order of this world provides us with clear evidence that\nan infinitely powerful and good being created and governs it. As we\nhave noted, Hume\u2019s argument falls short of categorically denying\nthat God exists on the ground that there is unnecessary evil in this\nworld. What Hume\u2019s arguments do show, however, is that while it\nis possible that the reality of evil is consistent with the existence\nof God this leaves theism with a large and significant problem that\nremains unanswered. The enormous degree of evil in this world, and the\nvast range of forms that it takes, are impossible to explain or\njustify from our human perspective (i.e., given the limits of human\nunderstanding). There is, therefore, no basis for inferring the\nexistence of an infinitely powerful and good God in face of contrary\nevidence of this kind \u2014 evidence that provides us with\nconsiderable grounds for doubting this conjecture or hypothesis.\n",
