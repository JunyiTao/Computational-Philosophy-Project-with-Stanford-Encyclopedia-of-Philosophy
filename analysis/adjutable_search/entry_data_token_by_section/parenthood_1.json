    "main_text": "Procreative Autonomy\n2. Procreative Autonomy\n\n20th-century international human rights documents\nexplicitly codify the right \u201cto marry and found a family\u201d\n(United Nations 1948, Article 16), and thus some writers argue that\nliberal constitutions implicitly enshrine a right to procreate (Hill\n1991). A right to procreate could be construed negatively or\npositively. As a negative right, it would be a right against coercive\ninterference in decisions regarding procreation. As a positive right,\nit would be an entitlement to assistance in procreation.\n\nThis entry does not consider abortion. Although positions on\nprocreative autonomy are not independent of positions on abortion, the\nextensive philosophical debate about abortion must be dealt with\nindependently. The issue of contraception can be touched on briefly\nhere. While some religious views oppose contraception, this position\nis not widely defended in philosophical ethics. However, philosophical\ndebate has recently emerged over \u201cconscientious\nobjections\u201d by pharmacists. In some jurisdictions, pharmacists\nopposing abortion have a legal right to refuse to dispense emergency\ncontraception, on the (medically controversial) basis that it acts as\nan abortifacient. This right has been defended on the grounds that\npharmacists\u2019 freedom of conscience outweighs the inconvenience\nto women (if they can obtain the drug elsewhere). Others have argued\nthat such refusals constitute serious harms to women, not mere\ninconveniences, and that similar objections would not be permitted in\nnon-procreative cases, such as a vegetarian pharmacist who refused to\ndispense materials tested on animals (LaFollette and LaFollette 2007;\nFenton and Lomasky 2005; McLeod 2010; Kelleher 2010; McLeod 2020).\n",
