    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Universals\n6.4 Universals\n\nBrito\u2019s contribution to the debate about the ontological status\nof universals can be found in his reply to the set of questions left\nunresolved in Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge. In his commentary on\nthis text, Brito raises the question whether the universal exists\nindependently of any intellectual operation. His reply is negative or\npositive depending on whether the question concerns the actual or the\npotential universal. In doing so, Brito puts forth a moderate realist\nposition with respect to the external existence of universals (see\nalso Sirridge 2008).\n\nOn the one hand, the actual universal does not exist independently\nfrom the intellect, because its being depends on a separation from\nmatter performed by the active power of the intellect (QsP;\nsee Pinborg 1980: 86). The actual universal is, indeed, the cognition\nof an essence, and hence it is evidently dependent on the\nintellect\u2019s activity (QsP; see Pinborg 1980: 100). \n\nOn the other hand, the potential universal exists independently of the\nintellect, because it is an essence that as one of its modes of being\nhas the capacity to be separated from matter by the agent intellect.\nBut the essence and its modes of being are in themselves external and\nindependent of such an intellectual separation (QsP; see\nPinborg 1980: 86 and 92). Therefore, the potential universal exists\nindependently from any intellectual operation.\n\nHowever, in a subsequent question (QsP; q.8) Brito also\npresents a way in which the actual universal can be said to exist in\nthe external world. For, as was explained above in Brito\u2019s\nlogic, any cognition is an abstract or concrete intention depending on\nwhether we consider it from the perspective of the cognitive subject\nor from the perspective of the thing understood. Hence, the actual\nuniversal understood as a concrete intention (i.e., as the thing\nunderstood) has external existence, although not independently of the\nintellect. But understood as an abstract intention (i.e., from the\nperspective of the cognitive subject) the actual universal exists only\nin the soul (QsP; see Pinborg 1980: 114).\n\nIn sum, Brito\u2019s realist position states that the universal has\nexternal existence in at least two senses: first, potentially, in the\nessence with the intrinsic capacity of becoming the object of\nuniversal cognition; second, actually, in the essence actually known\nthrough universal cognition by virtue of some of its modes of being.\n\n",
