    "main_text": "The Harm Principle\n4. The Harm Principle\n\nFar and away the best-known proposal for a principled limit to the law\nis the \u201charm principle\u201d from John Stuart Mill\u2019s\nOn Liberty. The pivotal sentence of its most famous passage\nreads:\n\n\nthe only purpose for which power can rightfully be exercised over any\nmember of a civilised community against his will is to prevent harm to\nothers. (Mill On Liberty, Ch. 1, para 9)\n\n\nHarm to others, can be contrasted with moral\nwrongfulness or immorality\u2014the legal moralist\u2019s\nstarting point; with offence to others; and with harm to\npersons choosing to engage in, or consenting to, the relevant\nconduct (anti-paternalism). At least as far as Mill\u2019s\ncanonical statement is concerned, moralism, offence and paternalism\nare ruled out as legitimate bases for legal coercion. The State may\nlegitimately stop A from beating up B, thereby limiting his freedom of\naction, because this prevents harm to B. And it may stop A from\nstealing from B for the same reason. But the State oversteps its\nproper limits on this view if it purports to stop A smashing up his\nown property; or to protect C from the distaste she will feel knowing\nthat A is doing this. And it may not treat the wrongfulness of\nconduct, in the absence of any unconsented-to harm, as a basis for\nlegal coercion: it may not for example prevent \u201cbloody\ngladiatorial contests presented by voluntary performers before\nconsenting audiences\u201d (Feinberg 1984: 13). For the harm\nprinciple, says Mill, is \u201centitled to govern absolutely the\ndealing of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and\ncontrol\u201d (Mill On Liberty, Ch. 1, para 9)\n\nIn his four-volume work, the Moral Limits of the Criminal Law\nJoel Feinberg sets out to defend a version of the harm principle that\nhe takes to be firmly in the spirit of Mill (Feinberg 1984, 1985,\n1986, 1990).\n\n\nThe Liberal Position: The harm and offense principles, duly\nclarified and qualified, between them exhaust the class of good\nreasons for criminal prohibitions.\n\n\nThis is compounded, first, of Feinberg\u2019s \u201charm to\nothers\u201d principle stating, as we saw in\n section 1:\n\n\nHarm to others: It is always a good reason in support of\npenal legislation that it would be effective in preventing\n(eliminating, reducing) harm to persons other than the actor (the one\nprohibited from acting) and that there is probably no other means that\nis equally effective at no greater cost to other values. (Feinberg\n1984: 26)\n\n\nBut Feinberg goes beyond Mill\u2019s officially stated position in\nadding, secondly, the offense principle:\n\n\nOffense to others: It is always a good reason in support of a\nproposed criminal prohibition that it is probably necessary to prevent\nserious offense to persons other than the actor and would probably be\nan effective means to that end if enacted. (Feinberg 1984: 26)\n\n\nThough this \u201coffense to others principle\u201d goes beyond\nMill\u2019s canonical position, Feinberg believed there to be support\nin Mill\u2019s writings for the addition of offense as a ground and\nin any case argued that there are independent grounds for thinking the\naddition of the offense principle strengthens the Millian position.\nThe place of offense and relatedly \u201cmoral distress\u201d\nremains controversial and has inspired an extensive literature\n(Feinberg 1985; Hart 1963 [1982: 46]; Waldron 1987 [1993]; Simester\n& von Hirsch 2011: 99\u2013140; Edwards 2019)\n\nThere is an important qualification to be made to Feinberg\u2019s\n\u201charm to others\u201d principle. One reason why one might want\nto treat harm as special is the yearning for a concept for practical\nuse that is \u201csimple, determinate\u201d and \u201cpurely\nempirical\u201d (Feinberg 1984: 214). Such a determinate empirical\nconcept, if it exists, could function free of the controversies that\nusually attend normative concepts. Everyone, from vastly diverse\ncultures, philosophies and opinions could get behind it, without fear\nof compromising what they hold dear. It is clear, however, that\nFeinberg abandons any hope, if this ever was a feasible ambition, of\nblocking out any such purely empirical notion. Instead he builds into\nhis harm principle a strong element of moral wrongfulness. As we have\nobserved, his harm principle is designed to reject moral\nwrongfulness as a legitimating ground for legal coercion, but the\ncrucial qualification here is that it rejects wrongfulness without\nmore as a legitimate basis for legal coercion. Moral wrongs,\nhowever, remain highly significant to the account. For harms\n\u201cproduced by justified or excused conduct (\u2018harms that are\nnot wrongs\u2019)\u201d are said by him not to count as\n\u201charms\u201d for the sake of his harm principle. It is thus not\nany harm to others that constitutes a good reason in support\nof legal coercion. It is the harms that are produced by \u201cmorally\nindefensible conduct\u201d that matter (Feinberg 1984: 215). In other\nwords, the proponent of Feinberg\u2019s harm principle must be highly\nconcerned with moral wrongs and immorality, perhaps almost as\nconcerned as the legal moralist.\n\nOn the one hand, this allows Feinberg to deal satisfyingly with a raft\nof potential counterexamples. Since, for him, a good reason for\ncoercion will present itself only if the harm in question is wrongful,\nhe can avoid designating as harmful setbacks to persons of the order\nof losing a professional tennis competition or of being driven out of\nbusiness by a rival\u2019s superior product, even if the consequences\nfeel like, and are, terrible events in the lives of the individuals\nconcerned. Be they so terrible they are not harms in the relevant\nsense for Feinberg, as they do not spring from any wrongdoing. On the\nother hand, the necessity of a moral wrong in his account of harms\nopens him up to potential criticism. For example, it might be claimed\nthat it is the wrongs that are doing the essential explanatory work,\nwhile harm is a redundant or near-redundant addition. Or the strong\nmoral wrongness element in the account might be taken as a tacit\nadmission that the reason the relevant harms matter in the first place\nis that they are morally wrongful; and if that point goes through, the\nnext question may be: why, then do wrongs that are not harms not\nalso matter enough to form, on occasion (and subject to\npotential defeating conditions), a valid reason for legal\ncoercion?\n\nFeinberg, however, is clearly Millian in his rejection of\npaternalism.\n\n\nPaternalism: It is always a good reason in support of a\nprohibition that it is probably necessary to prevent harm (physical,\npsychological, or economic) to the actor himself and that there is\nprobably no other means that is equally effective at no greater cost\nto other values. (Feinberg 1984: 26\u201327; Feinberg 1986)\n\n\nHis strong anti-paternalism is not equally hostile to everything that\nmight be described as legal paternalism. He distinguishes \u201csoft\npaternalism\u201d from \u201chard paternalism\u201d. In many cases\nthe forcible implementation of a person\u2019s will can accord with\nhis personal autonomy. Feinberg describes such cases as involving\n\u201csoft paternalism\u201d and contrasts them with those involving\n\u201chard paternalism\u201d (Feinberg 1986: 26). It is the\n\u201chard\u201d variety that Feinberg sets himself against, the\nforcible coercion of a person against her will for her own good. This\nhe rules out on grounds of legitimacy. In fact, he does not believe\nthat \u201csoft\u201d paternalism is really paternalism at all\nproperly so-called and so stops short of adding it to his list of\npotentially legitimating reasons for legal coercion (G. Dworkin\n2020).\n\nWhether or not Feinberg broke significantly with Mill on the question\nof offense, a much larger break with Mill is evident in the respective\ndefences of the harm principle offered by H.L.A Hart and Joseph Raz.\nSpeaking of Hart, Devlin observed that he \u201cmutinied\u201d\nagainst Mill and \u201cran paternalism up the mast\u201d (Devlin\n1965: 132). Hart indeed accuses Mill of carrying \u201chis protests\nagainst paternalism to lengths that may now appear to us\nfantastic\u201d (Hart 1963 [1982: 32]). Furthermore, anticipating\nparts of the \u201cNudge\u201d movement that emerged fully this\ncentury (Sunstein 2014), Hart speaks of\n\n\na general decline in the belief that individuals know their own\ninterests best, and to an increased awareness that a great range of\nfactors which diminish the significance to be attached to an\napparently free choice or consent. (Hart 1963 [1982: 32\u201333])\n\n\nRaz in turn speaks of his \u201cready embrace of various\npaternalistic measures\u201d, asserting it is \u201csenseless to\nformulate either a general pro- or a general anti-paternalistic\nconclusion\u201d (Raz 1986: 422: Simester & von Hirsch 2011: Part\nIV; Stanton-Ife 2020: 211\u2013220). The issue of paternalism is of\nconsiderable importance to the limits of the law, but for a deeper\ndiscussion beyond the brief remarks just made see the entry on\n paternalism\n (G. Dworkin 2020; cf. Hurd 2018; De Marneffe 2018; Conly 2018).\n\nHence Hart and Raz defend a \u201charm principle\u201d, not a\n\u201charm to others\u201d principle. Both nevertheless\nargue that it will often be the case that the state should not act\npaternalistically, only not in such a way that an exclusionary\nprinciple is merited. The dramatic differences between major\nproponents of the harm principle makes it misleading to speak of\nthe harm principle as one principle, although one suspects\nthe term is too far embedded in the debate to be dislodged. Therefore\nwe continue to speak of the harm principle, though strictly speaking,\nthere is more than one. The table below illustrates the divergence in\nthe views of the leading thinkers associated with the harm principle.\nNo one of them has an account with conclusions identical to any of the\nothers (see also Edwards 2014). What unites them all is the rejection\nof legal moralism.\n\n\nA family of harm-principle accounts:\n\npotentially legitimating grounds for legal coercion\n\n\nLegitimate basis for coercion?\nHarm to Others?\nOffence to Others?\nHarm to Self?\nLegal Moralism?  \n\n\nMill\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo \n\nFeinberg\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo \n\nHart\nYes\nYes, can be\nYes, can be\nNo \n\nRaz\nYes\nNo[11]\nYes, can be\nNo  \n\n\n",
