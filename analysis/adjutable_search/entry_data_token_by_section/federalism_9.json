The great variation and how the\nfeatures interact require careful comparative studies to understand\ntheir impact on law and politics (Palermo and K\u00f6ssler 2017). The\ndesign of federal orders raise peculiar and intriguing issues of\nnormative political theory (Watts 1998; Norman 2006).\n\n\n\nComposition: How to determine the boundaries of the member units,\ne.g., along geographical, ethnic or cultural lines; whether\nestablishment of new member units from old should require\nconstitutional changes, whether to allow secession and if so how,\netc. \n\n\nDistribution of Power: The allocation of legislative, executive,\njudicial and constitution-amending power between the member\nunits and the central institutions. In asymmetric arrangements some of\nthese may differ among member units. \n\n\nPower Sharing: The form of influence by member units in central\ndecision-making bodies within the interlocking political systems.\n\n\n\nThese tasks must be resolved taking due account of several important\nconsiderations noted below.\n",
