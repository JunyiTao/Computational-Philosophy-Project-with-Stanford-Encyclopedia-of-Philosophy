    "main_text": "John Buridan\n8. John Buridan\n\nJohn Buridan (c. 1300\u20131361) was the foremost logician of the\nlater Middle Ages and in his hands the theory of the syllogism was\nreworked and developed well beyond anything seen before in the history\nof logic. His two most important logical works are the Treatise on\nConsequence and the Summulae de Dialectica. The\npresentation here is primarily based on the Treatise (for\nfurther discussion, see Lagerlund 2000, Chapter 5, and Zupko 2003,\nChapters 5\u20136). \n\nIn the Treatise, Buridan bases his discussion of the\nsyllogism on a philosophical semantics that views syllogistic\ninference as a special case of the much more comprehensive theory of\nconsequences. Like his immediate predecessors, he was for the most\npart uninterested in assertoric syllogisms and moves on quickly to\ntemporal, oblique, variation, and modal syllogisms, though this does\nnot prevent him from making some original contributions to the theory\nof the assertoric syllogism.\n\nAccording to Buridan, a syllogism is a formal consequence, and so\nsyllogistic becomes a branch of the theory of formal consequence. As\nconsequences, syllogisms are distinguished by their conjunctive\nantecedent and single-sentence consequent, and furthermore by their\nthree terms \u2014 though this last condition is not necessary since\nBuridan also treats of syllogisms with more than three terms.\n\nBuridan treats of the three famous figures and notes that a conclusion\ncan be either direct or indirect. In an indirect conclusion, the minor\nterm is predicated of the major instead of the other way around. Since\nthe premises are part of a conjunction and together form the\nantecedent of a consequent, they can easily switch places, which means\nthat Buridan can define the fourth figure as a first figure with\ntransposed premises and an indirect conclusion. Hence, he does not\nneed to discuss it independently of the first figure.\n\nFor Buridan, a formal consequence holds by the principle of uniform\nsubstitution. It is valid for any uniform substitution of its\ncategorematic terms. A syllogism is a special kind of formal\nconsequence since it requires for its validity that terms be conjoined\nacross sentences. How the principle of uniform substitution is\nsupposed to work here is a bit tricky and forces him to bring into\nplay his general semantics as well as the notion of distribution. To\nspell out the relation of their terms and hence the validity of the\nfirst figure syllogisms, he reformulates the traditional dici de\nomni et nullo rules (see King 1985: 71):\n\n(8:1)\nAny two terms, which are called the same as a third by reason of\nthe same thing for which that third term supposits, not collectively,\nare correctly called the same as each other.\n(8:2)\nAny two terms, of which one is called the same as some third term\nof which the other is called not the same by reason of the same thing\nfor which that third term supposits, are correctly called not the same\nas each other.\n\n\nOne could say a great deal about these rules, but the term that does\nmost of the heavy lifting is \u2018supposits\u2019. Supposition is a\ntheory of reference and it is the coreferentiality of terms in the\ndifferent sentences in a syllogism that is the decisive factor in\ndetermining whether the principle of uniform substitution is satisfied\nor not. It is at this point that he introduces the theory of\ndistribution.\n\nThe rules governing the distribution of terms in a sentence are given\nas part of his account of common personal supposition. A term is\ndistributed in a sentence if it is taken to refer to everything it\nsignifies, such as if the term is in the scope of a universal\nquantifier. To indicate when a term is distributed he gives five\nrules, according to which universals distribute subjects, negatives\ndistribute predicates, and no other terms are distributed. If we stay\nwithin the square of opposition (Buridan\u2019s theory of distribution, and\nhence his syllogistic, has wide application, extending far beyond the\ntraditional A, E, I, and O sentences), this implies that universal\naffirmative sentences have their subject terms distributed, universal\nnegatives have both terms distributed, particular affirmatives have\nneither term distributed, and particular negatives have only their\npredicate terms distributed. (For an influential criticism of this\ntheory of distribution see Geach 1962, and King 1985 for a reply.)\n\nWith his theory of distribution in place, Buridan turns to the\nsyllogisms, and we see now that in order for a combination of premises\nto be acceptable, the middle terms must be distributed \u2014\notherwise we will not have a formally acceptable consequence. Buridan\napproaches the problem in combinatorial fashion. Given the four\nsentences and two possible positions for each we get 16 possible\ncombinations. Some of these can be ruled out immediately based on the\nrules for distribution. A combination with only negative premises will\nnot work at all; hence EE, EO, OE, and OO must be rejected. II has\nboth middle terms undistributed and can thus be rejected. In the first\nfigure, IA, OA, and OI have an undistributed middle. The other eight\nare accepted. In the second figure, we see that AA, AI, and IA must be\nrejected because of an undistributed middle. The other eight are\naccepted. In the third figure, IO and OI have an undistributed middle\nbut the remaining nine combinations are accepted.\n\nAt first glance, there are some surprises in Buridan\u2019s presentation of\nassertoric syllogistic. In the second figure he accepts indirect\nconclusions for IEO (Tifesno) and OAO (Robaco), and in the third\nfigure indirect conclusions for AOO (Carbodo), AEO (Lapfeton), and IEO\n(Rifeson). He also accepts syllogisms concluding to what he calls an\n\u201cuncommon idiom for negatives,\u201d that is, when the\npredicate term precedes the negation, as in \u2018Some B A is\nnot\u2019 (Quaedam B A est non). Such sentences make no\nsense in English, but Buridan treats them as equivalent to sentences\nwhere the predicate term quantified, as in \u2018Some B is not some\nA\u2019. He writes the sentences in this way because otherwise they\nwould violate his rules for distribution and scope. Syllogisms\nconcluding to an \u201cuncommon idiom for negatives\u201d add\nanother three valid forms in the first figure and two in the second.\nIf we tally this up and include all of the indirect conclusions, we\nget 33 valid moods, as opposed to 19 in Aristotelian syllogistic. If\nwe then add the supplementary subalternate conclusions, we get 24\nvalid moods in traditional syllogistic but 38 in Buridan\u2019s\nsystematization.\n\nBuridan is quite right to accept these additional 14 moods. They are\nvalid. But his result is not as dramatic as it seems since the middle\nterms are either in the subject or predicate position. In the second\nand third figure an indirect conclusion becomes equivalent to\ntransposing the premises. Hence Buridan\u2019s Tifesno, Robaco, Carbodo,\nLapfeton, and Rifeson reduce to Festino, Baroco, Bocardo, Felapton,\nand Ferison, respectively. This is also obvious if we look at the\nnames of these syllogisms, which suggest that Buridan has only\nreshuffled the letters of the names of the standard Aristotelian\nsyllogisms. After having done all this over just a few pages \u2014\nas mentioned above, Buridan is rather uninterested in assertoric\nsyllogistic \u2014 he turns to the temporal, oblique, and modal\nsyllogistic. Of these, it is modal syllogistic to which he devotes the\nmost time.\n\nA temporal syllogism consists of sentences whose copulas involve\ntemporal ampliation. In such sentences, the supposition of the subject\nterm is extended to include past and future things as well as present\nthings. The syllogistic for sentences involving oblique terms is\nimportant for Buridan\u2019s general theory of consequence, since this is\nwhere we find rules governing the behavior of oblique terms in\ndistributive contexts. His investigation is extraordinarily detailed\nand extremely rigorous, qualities all the more impressive when we\nconsider that he did not have the representational tools of modern\nsymbolic logic.\n\nThe syllogistic for composite modal sentences is straightforward and\nBuridan uses only a couple of pages in the Treatise to sketch\nits basic structure. The theory of the syllogism for divided modal\nsentences is given a much more thorough treatment. For Buridan, a\nmodal copula always ampliates its subject term to stand not only for\npresent, past, and future things but also possible things, unless the\nsupposition of the subject term is explicitly restricted to what is\nactual. On this basis, he can give an exhaustive account of the\nlogical relations between quantified divided modal sentences, which he\npresents in the octagon of opposition. Slightly simplified, and\nassuming that the complete octagon can be formed by some trivial\nequivalences holding between the modalities, it can be depicted as in\nFigure 1:\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nTogether with the octagon he also uses some consequences to prove the\nvalid syllogisms. He first states the valid conversion rules:\n\n(8:3)\nEvery B is possibly A \\(\\supset\\) Some A is possibly B\n(8:4)\nSome B is possibly A \\(\\equiv\\) Some A is possibly B\n(8:5)\nEvery B is necessarily not A \\(\\equiv\\) Every A is necessarily not B\n(8:6)\n(Quantity) B is contingently A \\(\\equiv\\) (Quantity) B is\ncontingently not A\n\n\nAll these are valid assuming their subject terms are ampliated. He\nalso employs the following consequences:\n\n(8:7)\nEvery B is necessarily not A \\(\\supset\\) Every B is not A\n(8:8)\n(Quantity) which is B is necessarily A \\(\\supset\\) (Quantity) B is A\n(8:9)\n(Quantity) B is A \\(\\supset\\) Some B is possibly A\n(8:10)\n(Quantity) B is necessarily (quality) A \\(\\supset\\) (Quantity) B\nis possibly (quality) A\n(8:11)\n(Quantity) B is contingently (quality) A \\(\\supset\\) (Quantity) B is \npossibly (quality) A\n\n\nBy stating these consequences and the octagon of opposition, Buridan\nhas presented a virtually exhaustive syntactical account of modal\nlogic, and, together with his semantics of supposition and\ndistribution, constructed a powerful logic unmatched by anything\npresented in the history of logic before him.\n\nBuridan uses four methods to prove the valid syllogistic moods. All\nfirst figure moods are proved by the rules of class inclusion, that\nis, the dici de omni and dici de nullo rules. The\nsecond and third figure moods are proved using three different\nmethods: either by conversion \u2014 that is, by (8:3), (8:4), (8:5)\nor (8:6) \u2014 by reductio ad impossibile, or by expository\nsyllogism. Proof by impossibility is used on a few occasions, but\nBuridan\u2019s approach here differs in no way from Aristotle\u2019s. This\nfourth way is frequently used to prove the valid third figure moods.\nSince the number of possible combinations of premises and conclusions\nin modal syllogistic is quite extensive, he limits himself to\ndiscussing those moods whose assertoric counterparts are valid, but\neven so he manages to discuss a large number of valid and invalid\nsyllogisms (see Hughes 1989, Lagerlund 2000, Thom 2003, Klima 2008,\nand Dutilh Novaes 2008).\n\nThere has been considerable scholarly discussion of Buridan\u2019s modal\nsyllogistic. It has been asked in particular whether it corresponds to\nany modern system of modal logic. The most popular answer is S5 (King\n1985). Some have argued that Buridan must have been thinking in terms\nof some kind of possible worlds model (Hughes 1989 and Knuuttila\n1993). Such comparisons of course reflect the extent to which these\nscholars have been impressed by Buridan\u2019s modal logic, which was\nwithout equal until the late twentieth century.(For an example of just\nhow powerful his general logic was see Parsons 2014.)\n",
