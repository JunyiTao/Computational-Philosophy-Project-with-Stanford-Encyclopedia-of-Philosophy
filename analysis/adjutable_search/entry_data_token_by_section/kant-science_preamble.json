    "main_text": "\n\nKant\u2019s philosophy of science has received attention from several\ndifferent audiences and for a variety of reasons. It is of interest to\ncontemporary philosophers of science because of the way in which Kant\nattempts to articulate a philosophical framework that places\nsubstantive conditions on our scientific knowledge of the world while\nstill respecting the autonomy and diverse claims of particular\nsciences. Of enduring interest is also his doctrine of laws, including\nthose of scientific theories.\n\nKant\u2019s scientific writings are also of interest to historians of\nmodern philosophy, historians of science, and historians of philosophy\nof science. Historians of modern philosophy are especially interested\nin determining how Kant\u2019s views on science might complement or\nclarify his distinctive metaphysical and epistemological doctrines\n(e.g., as expressed in the Critique of Pure Reason).\nHistorians of science reflect on how Kant\u2019s position fits in\nwith the views of other natural philosophers of the period, such as\nNewton and Leibniz. Historians of philosophy of science investigate,\namong other things, Kant\u2019s work in the conceptual foundations of\nphysics \u2014 in particular, his matter theory, his theory of\nmotion, and his account of the basic laws of mechanics.\n\nBecause physics was Kant\u2019s primary (though not exclusive) focus\nover the course of his lengthy career, his views on physics during his\npre-Critical (1746\u201370), Critical (1781\u201390), and Post-Critical periods\n(after 1790) will be discussed in separate sections. Subsections will\nbe devoted to each of the chapters of Kant\u2019s most influential\nwork in philosophy of science, the Metaphysical Foundations of\nNatural Science (1786). Kant\u2019s basic positions on other\nsciences, including psychology, chemistry, and history, will be\npresented thereafter.\n",
