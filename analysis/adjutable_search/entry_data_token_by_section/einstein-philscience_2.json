    "main_text": "Simplicity and Theory Choice\n3. Simplicity and Theory Choice\n\nFor Einstein, as for many others, simplicity is the criterion that\nmainly steers theory choice in domains where experiment and\nobservation no longer provide an unambiguous guide. This, too, is a\ntheme sounded early and late in Einstein\u2019s philosophical reflections\n(for more detail, see Howard 1998, Norton 2000, van Dongen 2002, 2010,\nGiovanelli 2018). For example, the just-quoted remark from 1918 about\nthe apparent determination of theory choice in practice, contrasted\nwith in-principle underdetermination continues:\n\nFurthermore this conceptual system that is univocally coordinated with\nthe world of experience is reducible to a few basic laws from which\nthe whole system can be developed logically. With every new important\nadvance the researcher here sees his expectations surpassed, in that\nthose basic laws are more and more simplified under the press of\nexperience. With astonishment he sees apparent chaos resolved into a\nsublime order that is to be attributed not to the rule of the\nindividual mind, but to the constitution of the world of experience;\nthis is what Leibniz so happily characterized as\n\u201cpre-established harmony.\u201d Physicists strenuously reproach\nmany epistemologists for their insufficient appreciation of this\ncircumstance. Herein, it seems to me, lie the roots of the controversy\ncarried on some years ago between Mach and Planck. (Einstein 1918, p.\n31)\n\n\nThere is more than a little autobiography here, for as Einstein\nstressed repeatedly in later years, he understood the success of his\nown quest for a general theory of relativity as a result of his\nseeking the simplest set of field equations satisfying a given set of\nconstraints.\n\nEinstein\u2019s celebration of simplicity as a guide to theory choice comes\nclearly to the fore in the early 1930s, when he was immersed his\nproject of a unified field theory (see, van Dongen 2010 for a\nreconstruction of the philosophical underpinning of Einstein\u2019s search\nof a unified field theory). Witness what he wrote in his 1933 Herbert\nSpencer lecture:\n\nIf, then, it is true that the axiomatic foundation of theoretical\nphysics cannot be extracted from experience but must be freely\ninvented, may we ever hope to find the right way? Furthermore, does\nthis right way exist anywhere other than in our illusions? May we hope\nto be guided safely by experience at all, if there exist theories\n(such as classical mechanics) which to a large extent do justice to\nexperience, without comprehending the matter in a deep way?\n\n\nTo these questions, I answer with complete confidence, that, in my\nopinion, the right way exists, and that we are capable of finding it.\nOur experience hitherto justifies us in trusting that nature is the\nrealization of the simplest that is mathematically conceivable. I am\nconvinced that purely mathematical construction enables us to find\nthose concepts and those lawlike connections between them that provide\nthe key to the understanding of natural phenomena. Useful mathematical\nconcepts may well be suggested by experience, but in no way can they\nbe derived from it. Experience naturally remains the sole criterion of\nthe usefulness of a mathematical construction for physics. But the\nactual creative principle lies in mathematics. Thus, in a certain\nsense, I take it to be true that pure thought can grasp the real, as\nthe ancients had dreamed. (Einstein 1933, p. 183; Howard\u2019s\ntranslation)\n\n\nEinstein\u2019s conviction that the theoretical physicist must trust\nsimplicity is that his work was moving steadily into domains ever\nfurther removed from direct contact with observation and experiment.\nEinstein started to routinely claim that this was the lesson he had\ndrawn from the way in which he had found general relativity (Norton\n2000). There are, however, good reasons to think that Einstein\u2019s\nselective recollections (Jannsen and Renn 2007) were instrumental to\nhis defense of relying on a purely mathematical strategy in the search\nfor a unified field theory (van Dongen 2010): \n\nThe theory of relativity is a beautiful example of the basic character\nof the modern development of theory. That is to say, the hypotheses\nfrom which one starts become ever more abstract and more remote from\nexperience. But in return one comes closer to the preeminent goal of\nscience, that of encompassing a maximum of empirical contents through\nlogical deduction with a minimum of hypotheses or axioms. The\nintellectual path from the axioms to the empirical contents or to the\ntestable consequences becomes, thereby, ever longer and more subtle.\nThe theoretician is forced, ever more, to allow himself to be directed\nby purely mathematical, formal points of view in the search for\ntheories, because the physical experience of the experimenter is not\ncapable of leading us up to the regions of the highest abstraction.\nTentative deduction takes the place of the predominantly inductive\nmethods appropriate to the youthful state of science. Such a\ntheoretical structure must be quite thoroughly elaborated in order for\nit to lead to consequences that can be compared with experience. It is\ncertainly the case that here, as well, the empirical fact is the\nall-powerful judge. But its judgment can be handed down only on the\nbasis of great and difficult intellectual effort that first bridges\nthe wide space between the axioms and the testable consequences. The\ntheorist must accomplish this Herculean task with the clear\nunderstanding that this effort may only be destined to prepare the way\nfor a death sentence for his theory. One should not reproach the\ntheorist who undertakes such a task by calling him a fantast; instead,\none must allow him his fantasizing, since for him there is no other\nway to his goal whatsoever. Indeed, it is no planless fantasizing, but\nrather a search for the logically simplest possibilities and their\nconsequences. (Einstein 1954, 238\u2013239; Howard\u2019s translation)\n\n\nWhat warrant is there for thus trusting in simplicity? At best one can\ndo a kind of meta-induction. That \u201cthe totality of all sensory\nexperience can be \u2018comprehended\u2019 on the basis of a\nconceptual system built on premises of great simplicity\u201d will be\nderided by skeptics as a \u201cmiracle creed,\u201d but, Einstein\nadds, \u201cit is a miracle creed which has been borne out to an\namazing extent by the development of science\u201d (Einstein 1950, p.\n342). The success of previous physical theories justifies our trusting\nthat nature is the realization of the simplest that is mathematically\nconceivable\n\nBut for all that Einstein\u2019s faith in simplicity was strong, he\ndespaired of giving a precise, formal characterization of how we\nassess the simplicity of a theory. In 1946 he wrote about the\nperspective of simplicity (here termed the \u201cinner\nperfection\u201d of a theory):\n\nThis point of view, whose exact formulation meets with great\ndifficulties, has played an important role in the selection and\nevaluation of theories from time immemorial. The problem here is not\nsimply one of a kind of enumeration of the logically independent\npremises (if anything like this were at all possible without\nambiguity), but one of a kind of reciprocal weighing of\nincommensurable qualities.\u2026 I shall not attempt to excuse the\nlack of precision of [these] assertions \u2026 on the grounds of\ninsufficient space at my disposal; I must confess herewith that I\ncannot at this point, and perhaps not at all, replace these hints by\nmore precise definitions. I believe, however, that a sharper\nformulation would be possible. In any case it turns out that among the\n\u201coracles\u201d there usually is agreement in judging the\n\u201cinner perfection\u201d of the theories and even more so\nconcerning the degree of \u201cexternal confirmation.\u201d\n(Einstein 1946, pp. 21, 23).\n\n\nAs in 1918, so in 1946 and beyond, Einstein continues to be impressed\nthat the \u201coracles,\u201d presumably the leaders of the relevant\nscientific community, tend to agree in their judgments of simplicity.\nThat is why, in practice, simplicity seems to determine theory choice\nunivocally.\n",
