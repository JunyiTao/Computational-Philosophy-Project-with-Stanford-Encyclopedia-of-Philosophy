Inferential Theories of Causation\n\nInferential theories of causation are driven by the idea that causal\nrelations can be characterized by inferential relations. In essence,\n\\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) are actual events, and\n(ii)\n\\(E\\) can be inferred from \\(C\\) in the context of a suitable\nbackground theory using a suitable logic.\n\n\nInferential theories may be seen as refinements and generalizations of\nregularity theories. For example, one can explain INUS conditions in\nterms of relatively simple inferences between the presumed cause and\nthe putative effect. In this explanation, the distinctive feature of\nMackie\u2019s theory is explained by the logical form of the\nbackground theory. In a propositional setting, this background theory\nhas the logical form of a biconditional \n\n\\[(C_{1,1} \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge C_{1,n}) \\vee \\ldots \\vee (C_{k,1} \\wedge C_{k,m}) \\leftrightarrow E.\\]\n\n\nEach \\(C_{i,j}\\) that co-occurs with all conjuncts of one conjunction\non the left-hand side of this biconditional is at least an INUS\ncondition for the effect \\(E\\). Obviously, we can infer \\(E\\) from\nsuch a \\(C_{i,j}\\) in the context of the biconditional and the other\nconjuncts that form, together with \\(C_{i,j}\\), a sufficient condition\nfor \\(E\\). However, the exposition of the INUS account in Mackie\n(1965, 1974) is not explicitly inferential. Likewise, Hume\u2019s\noriginal regularity theory can be interpreted inferentially, but it is\nnot an explicitly logical or inferential account.\n\nWe understand the notion of an inference relation in a broad way. In\nessence, an inference relation maps sets of sentences to sets of\nsentences such that this mapping is guided by some idea of truth\npreservation: if all members of a given set of premises are true, then\nall sentences inferable from this set must be true as well. Moreover,\nthere are inference relations that are guided by a weaker requirement:\nif all members of a given set of premises are believed, then it is\nrational to believe a certain set of conclusions. Nonmononotonic\nlogics and formal theories of belief revision define inference\nrelations in this sense. We shall say more about such inference\nsystems in\n Section 2.2.\n Suffice it to say for now that an inference relation understood in\nour broad way may be defined syntactically in terms of relations of\nderivability, or semantically in terms of possible worlds and\nmodel-theoretic interpretations, or both ways.\n\nInferential theories seek to improve on regularity theories. Recall\nfrom\n Section 1.1\n that virtually all regularity theories face two problems of\nextension. First, in the case of singular causal relations, we have a\ncausal relation without regularity. Second, in the case of spurious\ncausation, we have a regularity that is not considered to be causal. A\nsophisticated inferential theory may allow us to infer singular\nevents, such as the nuclear disaster in Fukushima and the extinction\nof the dinosaurs, from a rich background theory and certain further\nhypotheses about presumed causes and the context of the presumed\ncausal process. At least some inferential theories hold the promise to\ndistinguish between spurious and genuine causal relations. The idea is\nthat genuine causal relations may be characterized by distinctive\ninferential relations, and so be distinguished from spurious causal\nrelations.\n",
