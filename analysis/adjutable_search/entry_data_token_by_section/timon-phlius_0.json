    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nOn the basis of a number of slender indications, Timon\u2019s date of\nbirth is generally set at around 325\u2013320 BCE and his date of\ndeath at around 235\u2013230 BCE. For the details of his life we are\nwholly dependent on the brief account in Diogenes Laertius\n(9.109\u2013115) (see the entry on\n doxography of ancient philosophy);\n Diogenes wrote perhaps in the early to mid-third century CE, but his\naccount claims to be drawn from several earlier sources. According to\nDiogenes, Timon initially studied (after an early career as a dancer\nin his home town of Phlius, an inland city of the Peloponnese not far\nfrom the gulf of Corinth) with Stilpo of Megara. After an interval in\nwhich he returned home and married, he then went to Elis, in the\nnorthwest corner of the Peloponnese, to study with Pyrrho. Diogenes\nmakes it sound as if his stay at Elis was relatively brief; he says\nthat it lasted until Timon had children (9.109), and that at that\npoint he was compelled to go elsewhere to make money as a sophist, or\npaid teacher of philosophical and other theory to late adolescent\nyoung men. But whatever the length of his association with Pyrrho,\nTimon became an adherent of Pyrrho\u2019s philosophy from then on.\nHis activities as a sophist (whatever exactly these involved) appear\nto have left him financially secure; we are told that he then went to\nAthens and lived there (except for a short stay at Thebes) until his\ndeath. Diogenes names two kings with whom he was acquainted, and\nseveral poets with whom he collaborated; it is difficult to know what\nto make of this information, although the work of Clayman (2009) has\nshown, by means of detailed parallels with contemporary poetry, that\nhe was deeply immersed in the poetic world of his time. During his\ntime at Athens\u2014probably several decades\u2014he is likely also\nto have made the acquaintance of the leading philosophers of the time;\nDiogenes includes anecdotes featuring him making fun of\n Arcesilaus,\n who was head of the Academy during most or all of this time, but he\nno doubt encountered Stoics and Epicureans as well. That no\nrepresentatives of any of these schools refer to him in any surviving\nrecords is perhaps not surprising, given the scathing critiques that\nare implicit in his portraits of them in the Silloi.\n",
