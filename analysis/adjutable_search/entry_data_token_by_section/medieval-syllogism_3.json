    "main_text": "Peter Abelard\n4. Peter Abelard\n\nPeter Abelard (1079\u20131142) was one of the first original medieval\nlogicians in the Latin West. His most thorough treatment of the theory\nof the syllogism can be found in the Dialectica, though he\noccasionally discusses it in other works as well, such as the\nLogica ingredientibus (Minio-Paluello 1958). It is only in\nthe Dialectica, however, that the theory is outlined in full.\n\n\nSince the logic of the Dialectica is based on Boethius\u2019\ncommentaries and monographs, we find in it a treatise on categorical\nsentences and categorical syllogisms (Tractatus II), and\nanother on hypothetical sentences and hypothetical syllogisms\n(Tractatus IV). But neither of these discussions is very\nextensive. Taken together, they are shorter than the discussion of\ntopical inferences, which indicates that Abelard was most interested\nin developing a logic for sentences (Green-Pedersen 1984 and Martin\n1987). His presentation of syllogistic is condensed but highly\noriginal. It reveals that he was not able to study the text of\nAristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics in any detail. He must have seen\nit, but he cannot have had access to a copy himself.\n\nAbelard gives the four standard figures and shows how the second,\nthird, and fourth (he treats the fourth figure as part of the first\nfigure with the terms in the conclusion converted) can be reduced to\nthe first in the standard ways using conversion rules and proofs\nthrough impossibility, but to clarify and simply the theory he also\npresents rules showing the validity of the different moods. In the\nfirst figure he gives these rules (I have included the terms A, B, C\nto clarify the rules, though they are not in Abelard\u2019s text):\n\n(4:1)\nIf something A is predicated of something else B universally and\na third thing C places the subject B under it universally, then the\nsame thing C also places the predicate A under it with the same mode,\nnamely universally.\n(4:2)\nIf something A is removed from something else B universally and a\nthird thing C places the subject B under it universally, then the\nfirst predicate A is removed from the second subject C\nuniversally.\n(4:3)\nIf something A is predicated of something else B universally and\nsome third thing C places the subject B under it particularly, then\nthat thing C also places the predicate A under it particularly.\n(4:4)\nIf something A is removed from something else B and a third thing\nC places the subject B under it particularly, then the first predicate\nA is removed from the second subject C particularly.\n\n\nTo these he adds two more rules for the second figure:\n\n(4:5)\nIf something B is removed from some other thing A and a third\nthing C places that predicate B under it, then the first subject A is\nremoved from the second subject C universally.\n(4:6)\nIf something B is predicated of some other thing A universally and\nthat predicate is removed from a third thing C universally, then the\n[first] subject is removed from the same [subject] C\nuniversally.\n\n\nThere are three more rules for the third figure:\n\n(4:7)\nIf two different things A and C are predicated of the same B\nuniversally, then the first A predicated of the second comes together\nparticularly.\n(4.8)\nIf something B is removed from something A universally and\nsomething third C is predicated of the same subject B universally,\nthen the first predicate A is removed from the second C\nparticularly.\n(4:9)\nIf something A is predicated of something B particularly and the\nsame B with another predicate C supposits universally, then the first\nA is predicated of the second C particularly.\n\n\nIf we allow that the conjuncts in the antecedent of these conditional\nstatements can switch places, and that a universal implies a\nparticular, these rules exhaust the 24 valid syllogisms.\n\nAbelard\u2019s rules 1 and 2 are equivalent to the rules of class inclusion\nthat later became the subject of much discussion, i.e., the so-called\ndici de omni et nullo rules. These rules are based on the\ntransitivity of class inclusion and were the standard way in which\nlater medieval logicians explained how the first figure moods are\nperfect or evident.\n\nIt was elegant of Abelard to lay out these rules that entail the valid\nmoods, but then again, the theory of the syllogism is an elegant and\nsimple system. The simplicity of his nine rules reflects the\nsimplicity of Aristotelian syllogistic, since on Aristotle\u2019s view only\nthe first two syllogisms and the rules of conversion plus the method\nof proof by impossibility and a couple of other consequences are\nneeded to demonstrate all 24 valid moods.\n\nAbelard\u2019s hypothetical syllogistic does not repeat Boethius\u2019 mistake\nof mixing a term logic like the theory of the syllogism with a\nsentential logic. Rather, Abelard\u2019s work should be seen as a very\nsophisticated development of a sentential logic. I will therefore not\ntreat it in this overview, since it belongs to the history of\nsentential logic rather than syllogistic. It seems that the medievals\nalso rather quickly stopped associating the word\n\u2018syllogism\u2019 with this theory.\n\nAbelard is also associated with the history of modal logic. He is\nfamous as the philosopher who introduced the distinction between\nde dicto and de re modal sentences. The basic\nnotions of Abelard\u2019s modal theory are to be found in the introduction\nto Chapters XII and XIII of his longer commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nDe interpretatione (ed. Minio-Paluello 1958). Abelard\nconcentrates his analysis on the logical structure of modal sentences,\nintroducing some new distinctions and concepts that were later\ncommonly used by medieval logicians.\n\nAccording to Abelard, modal terms are strictly speaking adverbs\nexpressing how something said of the subject is actualized, e.g.,\n\u2018well\u2019 or \u2018quickly\u2019 or\n\u2018necessarily\u2019. Adverbs that do not modify an actual\ninherence, e.g., \u2018possibly\u2019, are called secondary modal\nterms due to their position in a sentence. Abelard also noticed that\nin De interpretatione 12\u201313, Aristotle operates with\nnominal rather than adverbial modes, e.g. \u2018it is necessary\nthat\u2019 or \u2018it is possible that\u2019. He seems to have\nassumed that Aristotle did this because the nominal modes lead to many\nmore problems than simple adverbial modes. This is more clearly seen\nfrom the fact that sentences including nominal modes, such as\n\u2018Necesse est Socratem currere\u2019, can be understood\neither adverbially, \u2018Socrates runs necessarily\u2019, or, as\nsuggested by the grammar, \u2018That Socrates runs is\nnecessary\u2019. He calls these two alternatives de re\nnecessity sentences and de sensu (or de dicto)\nnecessity sentences, respectively. Abelard seems to be the first to\nemploy this terminology. A de re modal sentence expresses the\nmode through which the predicate belongs to the subject. The mode is,\ntherefore, associated with a thing, whereas the mode in the de\ndicto case (as he also calls it) is said of what is expressed by\na non-modal sentence.\n\nAbelard also referred to this distinction as the distinction between\npersonal and impersonal readings of a modal sentence, the de\nre sense corresponding to the personal reading and the de\ndicto sense to the impersonal reading because when the expression\n\u2018necesse est\u2019 or \u2018possibile\nest\u2019 is used at the beginning of a sentence, it lacks a\npersonal subject. Abelard states that this distinction is related to\nAristotle\u2019s distinction between per divisionem and per\ncompositionem in the Sophistici Elenchi (4,\n166a23\u201331). What is new is Abelard\u2019s contention that modal\ndiscussions should proceed by distinguishing the different possible\nreadings of modal sentences, moving on to consider their quantity,\nquality, and conversion as well as their equipollence and any other\nrelations holding between them on these different readings.\nAbelard\u2019s program thus became the standard operating procedure in\nmedieval treatises on logic.\n\nAfter Abelard, equipollence and other relations between modal\nsentences were commonly presented with the help of the square of\nopposition, which Abelard mentions though it does not appear as such\nin his works. The square can be taken to refer to de dicto\nmodal sentences or to singular de re modal sentences.\nAlthough the distinction between de dicto and de re\nmodal sentences was common in logical treatises on the properties of\nthe terms, syncategorematic terms, and the solution of sophisms,\ntwelfth- and thirteenth-century logicians were mainly interested in\nthe logical properties of singular de re modal sentences.\nThere is no detailed theory of quantified de re modal\nsentences from this period, and the first movements in this direction\nby Abelard and his followers were rather confused. A satisfactory\ntheory of de re modal sentences did not appear until the\nfourteenth century, when the various relations between such sentences\nwas presented by John Buridan in his octagon of opposition.\n\nMedieval logicians generally assumed that Aristotle dealt with de\ndicto modal sentences in the De Interpretatione and\nde re modal sentences in the Prior Analytics. In\nearly commentaries on the Prior Analytics, there is usually\nno mention of Abelard\u2019s distinction between them. One reason may be\nthat the only theory available concentrated on singular de re\nmodal sentences, which are not part of modal syllogistic as developed\nby Aristotle.\n\nWhile the de dicto/de re terminology was used, it was not all\nthat common. Medieval logicians preferred to use what they took to be\nAristotle\u2019s terminology, talking about modal sentences in the\ncomposite sense (in sensu composito) and divided sense\n(in sensu diviso). The structure of a composite modal\nsentence can be represented as follows:\n\n(quantity/subject/copula, [quality]/predicate)mode\n\n\nA composite modal sentence corresponds to a de dicto modal\nsentence. The word \u2018composite\u2019 is used because the mode is\nsaid to qualify the composition of the subject and the predicate. The\nstructure of a divided modal sentence can be represented as\nfollows:\n\nquantity/subject/copula, mode, [quality]/predicate\n\n\nHere, the mode is thought to qualify the copula and thus to divide the\nsentence into two parts (hence the name, \u2018divided modal\nsentence\u2019). This type of modal sentence was characterized as\nde re because what is modified is how things (res)\nare related to each other, rather than the truth of what is said by\nthe sentence (dictum) (see Lagerlund 2000: 35\u201339, and\nthe entry on\n medieval theories of modality\n for further details).\n\nLike virtually all medievals, Abelard thought that Aristotle\u2019s modal\nsyllogistic was a theory for de re modal sentences. He says\nvery little about it in his logical works, however. In less than five\npages in the Dialectica (245\u2013249) he treats modal,\noblique, and temporal syllogistic logic. Earlier in the same work, he\nsays a little about conversion rules. He argues in both the\nDialectica (195\u2013196) and the Logica\n(15\u201316) that the conversion rules can be defended even on a\nde re reading, but the conversions he discusses are not modal\nconversions since the mode must be attached to the predicate and\nfollow the term in the conversion, making the conversion into the\nconversion of an assertoric sentence. The conversions of de\nre modal sentences, as Abelard has defined them, do not hold, as\nPaul Thom has convincingly shown. (Thom 2003: 57\u201358.)\n\nThere is no modal syllogistic explicitly outlined in any of Abelard\u2019s\nlogical works, though in the Dialectica, he exemplifies some\nof the valid mixed moods: M\u2013M in the first figure, MM\u2013 in\nthe second, and M\u2013M in the third (M represents a possibility\nsentence and \u2018\u2013\u2019 an assertoric). He also shows that\nuniform modal syllogisms are not generally valid, so that MMM is not\nvalid unless the middle term in the major premise is read with the\nmode attached to it, as in:\n\nEverything which is possibly B is possibly A\nEvery C is possibly B\nEvery C is possibly A\n\n\nA consequence of this, of course, is that the middle term in the minor\npremise is \u2018possibly B\u2019 and hence no longer a modal\nsentence. MMM is consequently reduced to M\u2013M.\n\nAnything more systematic than this has to be drawn out from Abelard\u2019s\ndefinition of modal sentences and their semantic interpretation. Thom\nhas done this in his book (Thom 2003), where he claims that there is a\nvery specific system developed that is not at all similar to\nAristotle\u2019s modal system. Abelard was therefore not attempting an\ninterpretation of Aristotle, but must be seen as developing a new\nsystem based on his reading of de re sentences. But this\nproject must overcome several problems, particularly since Abelard\ncannot use the conversion rule.\n",
