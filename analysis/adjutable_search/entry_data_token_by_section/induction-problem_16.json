    "main_text": "Alternative Conceptions of Justification || Meta-induction\n5.5 Meta-induction\n\nAnother approach to pursuing a broadly Reichenbachian programme is\nGerhard Schurz\u2019s strategy based on meta-induction (Schurz 2008,\n2017, 2019). Schurz draws a distinction between applying inductive\nmethods at the level of events\u2014so-called\n\u201cobject-level\u201d induction (OI), and applying inductive\nmethods at the level of competing prediction methods\u2014so-called\n\u201cmeta-induction\u201d (MI). Whereas object-level inductive\nmethods make predictions based on the events which have been observed\nto occur, meta-inductive methods make predictions based on aggregating\nthe predictions of different available prediction methods according to\ntheir success rates. Here, the success rate of a method is defined\naccording to some precise way of scoring success in making\npredictions.\n\nThe starting point of the meta-inductive approach is that the aim of\ninductive inference is not just, as Reichenbach had it, finding\nlong-run limiting frequencies, but also predicting successfully in\nboth the long and short run. Even if Hume has precluded showing that\nthe inductive method is reliable in achieving successful prediction,\nperhaps it can still be shown that it is \u201cpredictively\noptimal\u201d. A method is \u201cpredictively optimal\u201d if it\nsucceeds best in making successful predictions out of all competing\nmethods, no matter what data is received. Schurz brings to bear\nresults from the regret-based learning framework in machine learning\nthat show that there is a meta-inductive strategy that is predictively\noptimal among all predictive methods that are accessible to an\nepistemic agent (Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi 2006, Schurz 2008, 2017,\n2019). This meta-inductive strategy, which Schurz calls\n\u201cwMI\u201d, predicts a weighted average of the predictions of\nthe accessible methods, where the weights are\n\u201cattractivities\u201d, which measure the difference between the\nmethod\u2019s own success rate and the success rate of wMI.\n\nThe main result is that the wMI strategy is long-run optimal in the\nsense that it converges to the maximum success rate of the accessible\nprediction methods. Worst-case bounds for short-run performance can\nalso be derived. The optimality result forms the basis for an a\npriori means-ends justification for the use of wMI. Namely, the\nthought is, it is reasonable to use wMI, since it achieves the best\nsuccess rates possible in the long run out of the given methods.\n\nSchurz also claims that this a priori justification of wMI,\ntogether with the contingent fact that inductive methods have so far\nbeen much more successful than non-inductive methods, gives rise to an\na posteriori non-circular justification of induction. Since\nwMI will achieve in the long run the maximal success rate of the\navailable prediction methods, it is reasonable to use it. But as a\nmatter of fact, object-inductive prediction methods have been more\nsuccessful than non-inductive methods so far. Therefore Schurz says\n\u201cit is meta-inductively justified to favor object-inductivistic\nstrategies in the future\u201d (Schurz 2019: 85). This justification,\nhe claims, is not circular because meta-induction has an a\npriori independent justification. The idea is that since it is\na priori justified to use wMI, it is also a priori\njustified to use the maximally successful method at the object level.\nSince it turns out that that the maximally successful method is\nobject-induction, then we have a non-circular a posteriori\nargument that it is reasonable to use object-induction.\n\nSchurz\u2019s original theorems on the optimality of wMI apply to the\ncase where there are finitely many predictive methods. One point of\ndiscussion is whether this amounts to an important limitation on its\nclaims to provide a full solution of the problem of induction. The\nquestion then is whether it is necessary that the optimality results\nbe extended to an infinite, or perhaps an expanding pool of strategies\n(Eckhardt 2010, Sterkenburg 2019, Schurz 2021a).\n\nAnother important issue concerns what it means for object-induction to\nbe \u201cmeta-inductively justified\u201d. The meta-inductive\nstrategy wMI and object-induction are clearly different strategies.\nThey could result in different predictions tomorrow, if OI would stop\nworking and another method would start to do better. In that case, wMI\nwould begin to favour the other method, and wMI would start to come\napart from OI. The optimality results provide a reason to follow wMI.\nHow exactly does object-induction inherit that justification? At most,\nit seems that we get a justification for following OI on the next\ntime-step, on the grounds that OI\u2019s prediction approximately\ncoincides with that of wMI (Sterkenburg 2020, Sterkenburg\n(forthcoming)). However, this requires a stronger empirical postulate\nthan simply the observation that OI has been more successful than\nnon-inductive methods. It also requires something like that \u201cas\na matter of empirical fact, the strategy OI has been so much more\nsuccessful than its competitors, that the meta-inductivist attributes\nit such a large share of the total weight that its prediction\n(approximately) coincides with OI\u2019s prediction\u201d\n(Sterkenburg 2020: 538). Furthermore, even if we allow that the\nempirical evidence does back up such a strong claim, the issue remains\nthat the meta-inductive justification is in support of following the\nstrategy of meta-induction, not in support of the strategy of\nfollowing OI (Sterkenburg (2020), sec. 3.3.2).\n",
