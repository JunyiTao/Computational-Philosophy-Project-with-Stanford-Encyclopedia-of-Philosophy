    "main_text": "The Curry-Howard Correspondence\n7. The Curry-Howard Correspondence\n\nHaskell Curry was also to play an important role in\ndevelopments linking logic to computer science which some argue can\nlend support to formalism in mathematics. His work on combinatory\nlogic along with work of W.A. Howard\u2019s led to the\n\u2018Curry-Howard correspondence\u2019 (\u2018Curry-Howard\u2019\nhenceforth written \u2018CH\u2019) or \u2018CH isomorphism\u2019\nlinking logic, proof theory and computer science.\n\nCurry intended to provide a general theory of functionality as part of\na foundation for logic, \u201cpre-logic\u201d, as Curry called it.\nSee in particular (Curry 1934) and, with Robert Feys, (Curry and Feys\n1958). At around the same time as Curry\u2019s first publications in\nthe area, Alonzo Church developed his untyped \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus, also\ndesigned to provide a foundation for logic, indeed mathematics more\ngenerally, and also taking functions, very generally applicable, as\nfundamental. In these functional calculi, (for a comprehensive account\nsee Barendregt (1984), also the entry on\n the lambda calculus)\n a concatenation \\(fg\\) is used to represent the application of\nfunction \\(f\\) to argument \\(g\\) yielding an output value, where\nboth argument and value can themselves be functions and where\nself-application is allowed. Whereas Curry\u2019s system is\nvariable-free, variable binding in Church\u2019s occurs by means of\nthe \\(\\lambda\\) term, the variable \\(x\\) if and where it occurs in\n\\(N\\) being bound in \\(\\lambda x.N\\). The fundamental\noperation in \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus is \\(\\beta\\)-reduction, the transformation\nwhich takes us from \\((\\lambda x.N)M\\) to\n\\(N[x := M].\\) Here \\(N[x := M]\\) is\nthe result of substituting \\(M\\) for all free occurrences of\n\\(x\\) in\n \\(N\\).[1]\n So, for example, \\((\\lambda x.xx)f\\) \\(\\beta\\)-reduces\nto \\(ff\\). We can write this as: \n\n\\[\n(\\lambda x.xx)f \\rhd ff\n\\]\n\n\nThus these calculi achieve what Wittgenstein in the Tractatus\n(see above) seems to be gesturing at in his operations/function\ndistinction, for in Church and Curry we have a fully developed theory\nof \u2018operations\u2019, that is functions which can take\nfunctions as arguments and values. Of course self-application, as in\nthe infinite looping \\(\\beta\\)-reduction:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\lambda x.xx)(\\lambda x.xx) &\\rhd (\\lambda x.xx)(\\lambda x.xx) \\\\\n &\\rhd (\\lambda x.xx)(\\lambda x.xx) \\\\\n &\\vdots\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nraises worries that paradox may emerge. Church thought that eschewing\nthe use of free variables and restricting excluded middle (Church,\n1932: 346\u20137) blocked paradox but Kleene and Rosser showed\n(1935), using a strategy based on Richard\u2019s paradox, that the\nsystem was trivial: every formula could be derived using the rules.\nChurch fixed this up to produce a consistent untyped \\(\\lambda\\)\ncalculus, but the important step with regard to the CH correspondence\nwas the development of typed \\(\\lambda\\) calculi.\n\nNow \u2018type\u2019 is a very overworked word. Tokens of that type,\nto use one of its meanings (roughly as abstract syntactic object),\nhave sometimes been used to stand for properties, including\nhigher-order properties, as in Russell\u2019s various type theories.\nChurch was to continue this tradition in his simple typed version of\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus (Church, 1940). In this usage, types, such as the\nproperty of caninity or of being a shape, have instances such as Fido,\nin the first case, or the lower-order property of being square in the\nsecond case. Thus instances of types in this sense need not be\nabstract entities. Another usage is syntactic, as when the basic\nexpressions of a language are divided into various disjoint categories\n(\u2018types\u2019) and formation rules for generating well-formed\nexpressions are set down making use of the type distinctions. In this\nusage \u2018type\u2019 is an expression in the syntactic metatheory\nof the language of some object theory. In some cases the syntactic\ntheory is in fact part of the object theory under discussion.\nIndependently of this, some presentations of syntactic type theories\n\u2018push down\u2019 the syntactic metatheory into the object\ntheory under discussion by stipulating that the well-formed\nexpressions of the object language contain syntactic proper parts,\ntags as it were, which are correlated with the metatheoretic type of\nthe expression and have no semantic role. In Howard (1969), for\nexample, the well-formed formula of the conditional fragment of\npropositional logic are used as type symbols superscripting terms of\nthe type theory. \n\nThe expression \u00ab\\(N: \\tau\\)\u00bb which is usually read\nalong the lines of: \n\n\\[\n\\text{term } N \\text{ is of type } \\tau\n\\]\n\n\ncan be, therefore, read in a number of ways, for example: \n\nI: Non-syntactic: the entity referred to by \\(N\\) is an instance of\nthe class/set/property referred to by \\(\\tau\\), an instance which need\nnot be syntactic nor, more generally, abstract. \n\nII: Meta-syntactic: the expression referred to by \\(N\\) is an\ninstance of the syntactic category \\(\\tau\\). The syntactic theory in\nwhich the ascription of term to type occurs is \u2018meta\u2019,\nrelative to a background intellectual context, in that it is not there\npresented as (under its intended interpretation) part of a more\ngeneral, non-syntactic theory expressed in a language for which it\nitself provides the syntax. \n\nIII: Syntactic: the expression \\(N\\) is an instance of the\nsyntactic category \\(\\tau\\) and the type theory \\(is\\) a syntactic\ntheory for the language which it itself belongs to. \n\nWhilst some textbooks on type theory can seem, to the logician, to be\nrather hazy on exactly which, if any, of the above interpretations of\n\u2018type\u2019 is at issue this is certainly not generally the\ncase with the pioneers of these theories. Howard, for example, writes\nin his classic paper \u2018The Formula-as-Types Notion of\nConstruction\u2019:\n\nThe title has a second defect; namely, a type should be\nregarded as a [sic] abstract object whereas a formula is the\nname of a type. (1969: 479)\n\n\nand distinguishes between types and type symbols (480).\n\nThere are non-syntactic models of various type theories, though these\nwere developed later, for example (Scott, 1970), and make fairly\nstrong set-theoretic cardinality assumptions, such as the existence of\ninaccessible cardinals. Much more relevant for the formalist are\n\u2018term models\u2019, syntactic models similar to the\ninterpretations of languages which make use of their own symbols as\nthe members of the domain, interpretations to be found in Henkin\ncompleteness proofs; and especially \u2018syntactic semantic\u2019\napproaches, as in some interpretations of Per Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s\nintuitionist type theory (see the entry on\n intuitionistic type theory),\n or the \u2018proof-theoretic semantics\u2019 of Peter\nSchroeder-Heister\n (see the entry on proof-theoretic semantics)\n which eschew attempts to give meanings to types and terms by\nreference to \u2018external\u2019 truth-conditions: mathematical\nlanguage is not to be taken as a representation of some independent\nreality. \n\nIn such a context, the distinction between meta-syntactic and\nsyntactic readings of \u2018type\u2019 is not very important. Even\nif \u2018type\u2019 is taken to be a purely metatheoretic notion,\nthe axioms and rules of inference of type theory enable us to prove\nmeta-theorems about types. The situation can be compared to the\nrelation between sequent calculus and natural deduction, with the\nturnstile \\(\\vdash\\) of the former interpretable as a relation of\nderivability in some underlying natural deduction system, and the\nsequent calculus providing higher-order theorems about object language\nderivability. Thus whether or not one thinks of types as\nmeta-theoretic notions, the calculi of type theory are such that one\ncan prove theorems to the effect that term \\(N\\) is of type \\(\\tau\\).\n\n\nNow Curry\u2019s work in (1934) and more fully with Feys in (1958)\nhad shown a certain correspondence between provable formulae in the\ntheory of the conditional and the types of basic combinators in type\ntheory. In particular, with \\(\\rightarrow\\) as the conditional and\n\\(\\alpha \\Rightarrow \\beta\\) representing function types, that is\ntypes (construed non-syntactically) whose inputs are type \\(\\alpha\\)\nfunctions and outputs type \\(\\beta\\) functions, we have, (here\n\\(\\vdash_{T\\rightarrow}\\) means provability in the positive\n(non-relevantist) theory of the conditional and \\(\\vdash_{CL}\\) means\nprovability in a suitable combinatory logic): \n\n\n\\[\n\\vdash_{T\\rightarrow} \\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B} \\text{ iff for some }\nN, \\vdash_{CL} N : \\alpha \\Rightarrow \\beta\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(N\\) is a term built from basic combinators and \\(\\alpha\\) is\nstructurally isomorphic to A (likewise \\(\\beta\\) to B). That is, one\ncan generate A \\(\\Rightarrow\\) B from A \\(\\rightarrow\\) B by replacing\neach occurrence of \\(\\rightarrow\\) by \\(\\Rightarrow\\), given a uniform\nsubstitution (perhaps the trivial identity one) of sentential letters\nin the formulae of the propositional language by names for basic\ntypes. \n\nCurry and Feys (1958) extended the correspondence idea to one between\ntype theory and Gentzen\u2019s sequent calculus. In the paper already\ncited, circulated in 1969, but only published in a volume in a\nFestschrift for Curry in 1980, W.A. Howard (1969) deepened the CH\ncorrespondence by demonstrating a correspondence between\nintuitionistic sequent form natural deduction and type theory in\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus format, generalising to encompass intuitionist\narithmetic- \u2018Heyting arithmetic\u2019 (HA)- (thus requiring an\nextension from all of propositional to predicate logic), all as part\nof a project of investigation of the constructivist notion of a\nconstruction. Howard deepened the results by making clear not only a\ncorrespondence between provable formulae in the sequent calculus and\ntype ascriptions, but also between the terms in the type ascriptions\nand proofs of the corresponding\n formulae.[2]\n For example, (to the horror of relevantists) A \\(\\rightarrow\\) (B\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) A) is provable in T\\(_{\\rightarrow}\\). The\ncorresponding type is \\(\\alpha \\Rightarrow(\\beta \\Rightarrow\n\\alpha)\\), the type of the basic operator K, whose action is \n\n\\[\nNM \\rhd N\n\\]\n\n\nand whose \\(\\lambda\\) representation is\n\\((\\lambda x.(\\lambda y.x))\\) (usually abbreviated\n\\(\\lambda xy.x)\\), as can be seen by the \\(\\beta\\)-reduction\n chain:[3]\n\n\\[\n(\\lambda x.(\\lambda y.x)N)M \\rhd (\\lambda y.N)M \\rhd N.\n\\]\n\n\nThe simplest proof of A \\(\\rightarrow\\) (B \\(\\rightarrow\\) A) in T\\(_{\\rightarrow}\\) is:\n\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{\\dfrac{\\dfrac{}{A}\\scriptsize{1}}{B \\to A}}{A \\to (B \\to A)}\\scriptsize{1}\n\\]\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nin which the second step, to the intermediate conclusion B \\(\\rightarrow\\) A,\nis an instance of \\(\\rightarrow\\)I(ntroduction) with vacuous discharge of the\nunassumed antecedent B (in a sequent calculus version, the rule of\nthinning, adding extra assumptions in the sequent antecedent, would be\nused). The type theoretic proof in type theory\n TT[4]\n of the construction of a term \u201cinhabiting\u201d the type \\(\\alpha\n \\Rightarrow(\\beta \\Rightarrow \\alpha)\\) takes the form: \n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{\\dfrac{\\dfrac{}{x:\\alpha}\\scriptsize{x}}{\\lambda y.x:\\beta \\Rightarrow \\alpha}}{\\lambda xy.x:\\alpha \\Rightarrow (\\beta \\Rightarrow \\alpha)}\\scriptsize{x}\n\\]\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nHere \\(\\lambda\\) abstraction, the introduction of \\(\\lambda\\) terms,\ncorresponds to \\(\\rightarrow\\)I, so the \\(\\lambda\\) term\n\\(\\lambda xy.x\\) which is shown to have type \\(\\alpha \\Rightarrow \n(\\beta \\Rightarrow \\alpha)\\) \u2018codes\u2019 two steps of the type\ncorrelate of \\(\\rightarrow\\)I, namely the rule \\(\\Rightarrow\\)I introducing function\ntypes, and we can recover the above proof of the propositional\ntheorem. Moreover given the tight connection between type theoretical\ncalculi and programs in certain types of programming languages, we can\nalso see the TT proof as a program of steps in the construction of a\ncertain type of computational object.\n\nIn natural deduction systems, normalisation is the procedure by which\nredundant inferential loops are eliminated. In certain logics (such as\nintuitionistic logic), a normalisation metatheorem holds and tells us\nthat any proof can be stripped of its redundancy and reduced to a\nnormal form. A further level of correspondence, brought out by Howard,\nlinks normalisation with the \u2018evaluation\u2019 of programs in\nwhich complex terms are reduced to their simplest forms (this is not\nalways possible in the more expressively powerful type systems). \n\nIt seems to be Kreisel who introduced the slogan \u2018formulae as\ntypes\u2019, with Martin-L\u00f6f responsible for the more widespread\n\u2018propositions as types\u2019 slogan (See again, Wadler, 2015).\nIn the philosophical context, \u2018proposition\u2019 is often used\nto mean something like the meaning of a sentence, i.e. of a formula of\na certain sort. Using this terminology, a widespread intuitionist\nposition is that that the proposition expressed by a formula is the\nset (or species, for the intuitionist) of all proofs of the formula.\nGiven that different provable formulae will correspond to different\ntypes, the CH correspondence allows us to rephrase this\n\u2018syntactico-semantics\u2019 position as: the proposition\nexpressed by a formula of HA is the type of its proofs, where\n\u2018type\u2019 is not a straightforward synonym for\n\u2018set\u2019 or \u2018species\u2019 but the notion from\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus. As noted, this calculus is a formal system with\nrich interconnections with programming and computer science and\nreadings in which the instances of types are purely syntactic, for\nexample proof-theoretic entities. Hence the meaning of a formula, the\nproposition expressed, on such readings, does not represent a reality\ndistinct from the linguistic system in which the formula occurs. \n\nThe connection with intuitionism, then, is clear: but what is the\nrelevance of the CH correspondence to formalism? There are, in the\nfirst place, clear overlaps between some forms of intuitionism and\ncertain formalist positions. Not the philosophical intuitionism of the\nfounding father Brouwer, of course, with its ontology of mathematical\nobjects as mental constructions and an epistemology in which\nmathematical knowledge is based on internal reflection on the\nsuccession of ideas; this is a mathematical metaphysics far removed\nfrom formalism. But many constructivists have embraced, without\naccepting his metaphysics, the Brouwerian identification, or close\nlinkage, of mathematical correctness (truth, if one is prepared to\nspeak of mathematical truth) with provability. This sort of\nidentification is more than congenial to a certain brand of formalism,\none which rejects the idea that mathematical theses represent a\nmind-independent reality and which also divides the sheep from the\ngoats on the basis of those which are provable, in some formal system,\nversus those which are disprovable.\n\nBut there are also substantial differences between the intuitionist\nand the formalist. For one thing, not only Brouwer but also many later\nconstructivists refuse to identify provability with provability in\nsome formal system. For another, formalists have generally felt free\nto help themselves to classical logic, and have emphasised the free\ncreativity of the mathematician: she should be free to generate\nwhatever mathematical theories she wishes, subject only to withdrawing\nthem if they turn out to be inconsistent (in the chosen background\nlogic). \n\nOn the first point the formalist will, of course, be a formalist! She\nwill link correctness, at least at the most fundamental level, to\nformal proof. Here, then, the CH correspondence, or better\ncorrespondences, are surely very attractive to the formalist. The\nlinkage between propositions and computations, algorithmic reductions\nof terms coding proofs to irreducible normal forms in particular, fits\nvery snugly with those versions of formalism which take mathematics to\nbe, at heart, shuffling of symbols with no external reference.\n\nOn the second point, further work on the CH correspondences\ngeneralised the results from intuitionistic logic to a wide variety of\nother logics, in particular to classical logic (Griffin, 1990), as\nwell as to other logical frameworks such as modal logic and linear\nlogic. There is no burdensome logical restriction imposed by\n\u2018Formulae-as-Types\u2019 then, no need for the formalist to\nfight with one hand tied behind her back.\n\nWhat of the free creativity the formalist cherishes? Constructivist\ntype theory has, of course, been extended well beyond Heyting\narithmetic, particularly ambitious extensions are to be found in the\nunivalent foundations project based on homotopy type theory (Awodey,\n2014). This, then, is an avenue a formalism based on Formulae-as-Types\nmight pursue. But for a formalist who wishes to be non-revisionist\nabout non-constructivist mathematics the prospects are perhaps less\nclear. It is not enough just to add in the extra axioms or inference\nrules which yield the particular theory, in a standard framework, e.g.\nof a first-order or higher-order language. For one needs to do the\nfurther work needed to show that an extension of the CH correspondence\nobtains in this system. \n\nMoreover there is also an issue with primeness in the sense of the\nproof-theoretic property (which intuitionist logic satisfies) that\nwhen \\(\\vdash\\) A \\(\\vee\\) B then either \\(\\vdash\\) A or \\(\\vdash\\) B. Classical\ntheories typically do not have this property and this will pose\nproblems for generalising the CH correspondence and for justifying\nexcluded middle (assuming the formalist does not simply take all\nnon-trivial calculi as legitimate without need of justification). If\ncorrectness of a mathematical claim, relative to a particular\nframework, is identified with provability and if a disjunction can be\ncorrect where neither disjunct is provable then the formalist would\nseem to require some fancy footwork\u2014supervaluationalism is not\nobviously appropriate here\u2014to justify using classical logic.\n\n\nThere is also the problem of applicability, which Frege thought an\ninsuperable one for formalists. What can the meaning be of applied\nmathematical notions, such as \u00abthe number of \\(\\phi\\)s\u00bb,\nwhere mathematical and non-mathematical discourse is mixed together?\nUnless the formalist wishes to go down the Dummettian anti-realist\nroute and generalise the notion of proof to a notion of verification\nappropriate for empirical language, she will have to find a way of\ncombining, without too much ad hocness, a proof-theoretic semantics\nfor pure mathematics with a different, perhaps a realist,\ntruth-conditional semantics, for empirical language. \n\nFinally it should be noted that CH formalism, if we can call it such,\nwill be unacceptable to the formalist who is motivated by\nanti-platonist concerns and wishes to exclude abstract objects from\nall mathematics, including metamathematics. For the meanings of\nconcrete utterances of mathematical formulae, according to CH\nformalism, are sets/species/types of proofs, and the latter are\nabstract objects, infinitely many of them, of arbitrarily long finite\nlength. The problem of the metatheory, in other words, has not been\nmet. The anti-platonist cannot straightforwardly lift the ideas of\nsyntactico-semantics and apply the CH correspondence in support of\nanti-platonism; a great deal more philosophical work is required.\n",
