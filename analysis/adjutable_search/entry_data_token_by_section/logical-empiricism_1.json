    "main_text": "Background\n2. Background\n\nWith a movement as large and complex as logical empiricism a great\nmany factors went into raising the questions it would address, making\nthem seem urgent, and making it seem as though the intellectual\nresources it would need to address these questions were either at hand\nor could be developed.\n\nOne long-term process with profound implications was the steady\ndeparture of the various sciences from philosophy to form autonomous\ndisciplines. By early in the twentieth century mathematics, physics,\nchemistry, biology, and the social sciences were all pursued\nprofessionally and independently from philosophy. And psychology was\njust separating from philosophy. Yes, there were polymaths who could\nand did pursue a science and philosophy professionally. Those were\nincreasingly rare, though single-discipline scientists did from time\nto time make philosophic-seeming pronouncements. But they did so from\noutside the field. This pattern of steady departures raised the\npressing question: What sort of thing remained behind? Once\nmathematics and the empirical sciences all left, what was left for\nphilosophy?\n\nThe nature of philosophy was always a vexed philosophic question, but\nnow it was particularly insistent. Surely there was no domain of\nempirical facts that philosophy could call its own. All that real\nestate had been parceled out. One answer available at the time that\nlogical empiricism flourished was that the genuinely philosophic\nremainder after the departure of the sciences is somehow deeper than\nthe empirical sciences and gets at matters, perhaps cultural ones,\nthat are more profound and important than anything that empirical\nscience even can address. This is either because on this conception\nphilosophy has a mode of access or \u201cevidence\u201d that the\nempirical sciences do not and cannot have, or because the very idea of\nfidelity to evidence and punctilious argument is somehow\nsmall-minded.\n\nThe logical empiricists found this answer unappealing. Indeed, this\nconception of philosophy is precisely what Carnap means by\n\u2018metaphysics\u2019. (As a consequence, what Carnap meant by\nthat word is different from what late twentieth and early twenty-first\ncentury philosophers generally mean in describing their own work as\nanalytic metaphysics.) The logical empiricists were eager to conceive\nof their enterprise as scientific and to engage in philosophy only\ninsofar as it was also scientific. This science need not be empirical\nand need not include all that was traditional in philosophy that had\nnot been incorporated into the independent sciences. The decision to\nbe scientific can hardly be the end of the story. It requires rather\nbetter and more detailed answers to questions about what scientific\nmethods are, how the mathematical (and other apparently non-empirical\nsciences) fit together with the empirical ones, and what, more\nprecisely, philosophy\u2019s role was.\n\nA second series of developments that raised questions for logical\nempiricism to address were developments in the sciences themselves,\nespecially the rise of non-Euclidean geometries in mathematics and the\nestablishment of relativity theory in physics. These posed a serious\nchallenge to what would otherwise be an attractive scientific\nphilosophy, namely some version of Kantianism. Kant had recognized\nthat the best of modern science was often mathematical in character\nand had labored to integrate both geometry and arithmetic into our\nempirical picture of the world. He had held that we could not\nrepresent the world except as a Euclidean structure and hence\nEuclidean geometry was, a priori, a permanent feature of any future\nphysics. The demonstration that non-Euclidean pure geometrical\nstructures were as consistent as Euclidean ones and that spaces can\nindeed be represented as a non-Euclidean manifolds was one half of the\nproblem. The other half came when Einstein argued convincingly that\nphysical space was best described as a non-Euclidean manifold of\nnon-constant curvature. Plainly Euclidean geometry could not be\nguaranteed a future physics. Modern mathematical logic also posed a\nproblem for other Kantian claims, but not in the same wrenching\nway.\n\nMany logical empiricists started out as neo-Kantians: Reichenbach,\nCarnap, Schlick, and even Hempel (until he studied with Reichenbach,\nwho by that time had revised his view). The difficulties with geometry\nand relativity certainly do not refute all forms of neo-Kantianism,\nbut the difficulties are quite real nonetheless. The need is to\nunderstand how mathematics can be integrated into what is otherwise an\nempirical enterprise, i.e., physics, chemistry, biology, etc.\nAddressing this need was to be a major part of the logical empiricist\nprogram.\n\nThe background of logical empiricism described so far has been\nconfined to the academic world, but events outside that domain shaped\nthe movement as well. World War I was an unmitigated disaster for\ncentral Europe, followed by economic turmoil in the 20s and political\nupheavals of the 30s. It is hard to exaggerate these changes.\nMonarchies that had stood for centuries disappeared overnight and\ntheir empires disintegrated. This level of political convulsion had\nnot been seen since the French Revolution, and that earlier upheaval\nwas comparatively confined. Cultural changes were equally profound,\nand these were reflected by radical departures in the arts such as\npainting, music, and architecture, and even more importantly in new\nmodes of living.\n\nThe logical empiricists were no mere bystanders. They, or at least the\nmain leaders of the movement, were politically and culturally engaged.\nEven more important, this engagement was accompanied by the conviction\nthat their cultures were incapable of the necessary reform and renewal\nbecause people were in effect enslaved by unscientific, metaphysical\nways of thinking. Such ways of thinking might be exemplified in\ntheology, in the racial hatreds of the day, in conceptions of\nproperty, and in traditional ideas about the \u201cproper\u201d\nroles of men and women in society. So to articulate a\n\u201cscientific world conception\u201d and to defend it against\nmetaphysics was not just to express an academic position in the narrow\nsense. It was a political act as well; it was to strike a blow for the\nliberation of the mind. To articulate scientific methods and a\nscientific conception of philosophy was the essential first step in\nthe reform of society and in the emancipation of humankind (Carnap\n1958/2017, Creath 2009, Uebel 2012.\n\nIf all of this sounds like something out of the 18th\ncentury Enlightenment, the analogy was not lost on the logical\nempiricists themselves. Andr\u00e9 Carus has argued that this is\nexactly what Carnap had in mind by \u201cexplication\u201d (Carus\n2007). Neurath frequently drew parallels between the logical\nempiricists\u2019 anti-metaphysical program and the earlier\nEnlightenment ambitions. Certainly Kant had inveighed against the\nmetaphysics of his time, and the anti-metaphysical tradition remained\nstrong within the scientific community through the 19th\ncentury.\n\nThe point so far was not to ask whether the logical empiricists were\nright in any of this. That question will come up later. So far the\nissue has been only to see the motivations that the logical\nempiricists had\u2014and from their point of view\u2014for\naddressing certain questions and for thinking that answers to those\nquestions were urgently needed. None of this, however, says why the\nlogical empiricists thought they had or could have the means to answer\nthese questions. To that we now turn.\n\nSince Newton the most paradigmatic examples of empirical science were\nthose claims, usually quantitative ones, that were properly inferred\nfrom or appropriately confirmed by experience. Speaking very\ninformally, these are the ones that we have good reason to believe or\nat least better reason to believe than the available alternatives. The\nproblem, of course, is to specify the form of proper inferences, the\nform of an appropriate confirmation relation, and/or the structure of\ngood reasons. The task is daunting, but logic in a suitably broad\nsense seems to be the right tool. Still speaking informally, logic\nseems to give us the structure of (good) reasoning. There are other\nconceptions of logic, of course, but this is a standard one and pretty\nwell describes what the movement needed.\n\nIf logic was the tool that was wanted, it was newly ready for service.\nThe progress of modern mathematical logic from Bolzano through Russell\nand beyond was truly impressive. Arguably, it could now express all\nparts of classical mathematics. Besides the first order predicate\ncalculus one would need either set theory or higher order logic, but\nthese were recent developments as well. Logic, like the empirical\nsciences, was progressive and could be approached cooperatively by\nmore than one investigator. In Our Knowledge of the External\nWorld (1914) Russell had even positioned logic as the\nlocus of scientific method in philosophy. It is small wonder then that\nthose who were looking for something scientific in what was left of\nphilosophy turned to logic. Wittgenstein\u2019s no-content theory of\nlogic in the Tractatus (1921/1922) was tantalizingly\nsuggestive about how mathematics could be integrated into an overall\nempirical theory of the world. Wittgenstein also expressed a radical\nverificationism in the early 1930s in his conversations with Schlick,\nWaismann, and other members of the Vienna Circle. Many of the logical\nempiricists in turn could see in some version of that verificationism\nthe ideal tool with which to carry out their anti-metaphysical\nprogram. There was, naturally, much left to accomplish, but even with\nG\u00f6del\u2019s results one could expect that further impressive\nstrides in logic could be made. Indeed, much was accomplished even if\nthe perfect account of scientific reasoning proved elusive. Perfection\nis elusive in all the sciences, but that is no reason for despair.\n",
