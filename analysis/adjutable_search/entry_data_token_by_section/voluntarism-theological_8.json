    "main_text": "Perennial difficulties for metaethical theological voluntarism\n3. Perennial difficulties for metaethical theological voluntarism\n\nApart from the difficulties that must be handled by particular\nformulations of theological voluntarism, there are a number of\nobjections that have been levelled against theological voluntarist\nviews as such. A wide variety of these objections are helpfully\ndiscussed in Quinn 1999 (pp. 65\u201371) and Evans 2013 (pp.\n88\u2013117). Here I will consider only two objections, but they are\nthe two that are characteristically taken to be the most powerful\nperennial objections to theological voluntarism: first, that\ntheological voluntarism is incompatible with any substantive sense in\nwhich God is good; second, that theological voluntarism entails the\narbitrariness of morality. While these objections have been answered\nplausibly in recent formulations of theological voluntarism, the way\nthat these objections have been answered leave theological\nvoluntarists open to a different objection: that theological\nvoluntarism is not adequately motivated as a philosophical position,\neven for theists. I conclude with a brief discussion of this\nworry.\n",
