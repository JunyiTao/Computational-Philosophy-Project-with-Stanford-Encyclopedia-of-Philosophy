    "main_text": "Three structuralist programs || Interactions between the three structuralist programs\n6. Summary\n\nWe have sketched three structuralistic programs which have been\ndeveloped since the 1970s in order to tackle problems in philosophy of\nphysics, some of which are relevant also for physics itself. Any\nprogram which employs a weighty formal apparatus in order to describe\na domain and to solve specific problems has to be scrutinized with\nrespect to the economy of its tools: to what extent is this apparatus\nreally necessary to achieve its goals? Or is it concerned mainly with\nself-generated problems? We have tried to provide some arguments and\nmaterial for the reader who ultimately has to answer these questions\nfor him- or herself.\n",
