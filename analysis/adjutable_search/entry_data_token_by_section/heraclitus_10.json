    "main_text": "Influence\n8. Addendum\n\nThe recently published Derveni Papyrus, discovered in a tomb in\nnorthern Greece, contains a commentary on an Orphic poem. The\ncommentator discusses some passages of Heraclitus in connection with\nthe poem, namely B3 + B94 (which may have been thus joined in\nHeraclitus\u2019 book) (column 4). See Betegh 2004. The Oxyrhynchus\nPapyri (vol. 53, no. 3710) also show that Heraclitus was interested in\ndetermining the days of the lunar month and thus in scientific\nquestions. See Burkert 1993. On the Derveni Papyrus material, see\nBetegh & Piano 2019, 2022; Ranocchia 2019; and Hladky 2022.\n\nIn recent work, scholars have devoted special attention to\nHeraclitus\u2019 moral and political theory (Fattal 2011, Sider 2013,\nRobitzsch 2018), to questions of logos and rationality (H\u00fclsz\n2013, Long 2013), to the material character of soul (Betegh 2007), and\nto the theory of elemental change (Neels 2018).\n\nThere is an important new edition of the Presocratics, which contains\na volume mostly dedicated to Heraclitus, with a generous selection of\ntexts including many dedicated to reception (Laks and Most 2016).\nThere is also an important new study of Heraclitus that defends a\ntraditional interpretation of the sources (Finkelberg 2017).\n\nHeraclitus\u2019 influence on culture seems undiminished, appearing\nprominently in studies of fields as diverse as business management and\nveterinary medicine. Often cited as the philosopher of flux,\nHeraclitus now seems to be emerging as the standard-bearer for process\nphilosophy, having displaced more recent icons such as Henri Bergson\nand Alfred North Whitehead. See, for instance, van Geert and de Ruiter\n2022, a major contribution to the discipline of psychology. (On\nHeraclitus as a process philosopher, see Graham 2011.)\n",
