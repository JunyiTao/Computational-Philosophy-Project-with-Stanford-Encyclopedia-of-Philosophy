    "main_text": "\n\nCharles Darwin and Alfred Wallace are the two co-discoverers of\nnatural selection (Darwin & Wallace 1858), though, between the\ntwo, Darwin is the principal theorist of the notion whose most famous\nwork on the topic is On the Origin of Species (Darwin 1859).\nFor Darwin, natural selection is a drawn-out, complex process\ninvolving multiple interconnected causes. Natural selection requires\nvariation in a population of organisms. For the process to work, at\nleast some of that variation must be heritable and passed on to\norganisms\u2019 descendants in some way. That variation is acted upon\nby the struggle for existence, a process that in effect\n\u201cselects\u201d variations conducive to the survival and\nreproduction of their bearers. Much like breeders choose which of\ntheir animals will reproduce and thereby create the various breeds of\ndomesticated dogs, pigeons, and cattle, nature effectively\n\u201cselects\u201d which animals will breed and creates\nevolutionary change just as breeders do. Such \u201cselection\u201d\nby nature, natural selection, occurs as a result of the struggle for\nexistence and, in the case of sexual populations, the struggle for\nmating opportunities. That struggle is itself the result of checks on\nthe geometric population increase that would occur in the absence of\nthe checks. All populations, even slow-breeding ones such as those of\nelephants, will increase in size in the absence of limitations on\ngrowth that are imposed by nature. These checks take different forms\nin different populations. Such limitations may take the form of\nlimited food supply, limited nesting sites, predation, disease, harsh\nclimactic conditions, and much else besides. One way or another, only\nsome of the candidate reproducers in natural populations actually do\nreproduce, often because others simply die before maturity. Owing to\nthe variations among the candidate reproducers, some have better\nchances of making it into the sample of actual reproducers than do\nothers. If such variations are heritable, the offspring of those with\nthe \u201cbeneficial\u201d traits will be likely to produce\nespecially many further descendants themselves. To use one of\nDarwin\u2019s own examples, wolves with especially long legs that\nallow them to run more quickly will be more likely to catch prey and\nthereby avoid starvation and so produce offspring that have especially\nlong legs that allow them, in turn, to breed and produce still more\nlong-legged descendants, and so on. By means of this iterative\nprocess, a trait conducive to reproduction that is initially found in\none or a few population members will spread through the\npopulation.\n\nMultiple bouts of Darwin\u2019s process involving different traits,\nacting sequentially or in concert, may then explain both how\nspeciation and the evolution of complex adaptations occur through the\ngradual evolution (change over time) of natural populations. Darwin\naimed to convince his audience that even such structures as the\nvertebrate eye, which at first seem explicable only as the product of\ndesign, could instead be explained by incremental, directional\nevolution, a complex but still naturalistic process (Darwin 1859: ch.\n6). What is initially a light sensitive patch may be transformed into\nan eye by means of a great many bouts of selection that gradually\nimprove and enhance its sensitivity. Showing that something is\nexplicable is importantly different from explaining it (Lennox 1991);\nstill, a theory must be an explanatory sort of theory for it to\naccomplish either task. After Darwin, the appearance of novel species\nin the geological record and the existence of designed-appearing\nadaptations cannot be used as grounds for invoking supernatural causes\nas a matter of last explanatory resort.\n",
