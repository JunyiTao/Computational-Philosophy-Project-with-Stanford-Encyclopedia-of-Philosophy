    "main_text": "Relationships between nonbelief and evil\n1. Relationships between nonbelief and evil\n\nSeveral relationships between nonbelief and evil appear when we view\nthem as providing evidence for atheism.\n\n(A) It is customary to distinguish \u201clogical\u201d\n(\u201cdeductive\u201d) arguments from evil from\n\u201cevidential\u201d (\u201cinductive\u201d,\n\u201cabductive\u201d, \u201cprobabilistic\u201d) arguments from\nevil. There are different ways to draw that distinction. On one way\n(Howard-Snyder 1996c), a logical argument from evil affirms of some\nknown fact about evil that it is incompatible with theism (e.g.,\nMackie 1955; Schellenberg 2007a), while an evidential argument from\nevil does not\u2014either because it affirms that the fact in\nquestion, although incompatible with theism, is not known but only\nreasonably believed to be the case (e.g., Rowe 1979), or because it\naffirms that the fact in question, though known, is more unlikely on\ntheism than on some competing hypothesis (e.g., Draper 1989; Oppy\n2013). Likewise for nonbelief. A logical argument from nonbelief\naffirms of some known fact about nonbelief that it is incompatible\nwith the existence of God (Drange 1998), while an evidential argument\nfrom nonbelief does not\u2014either because it affirms that the fact\nin question, although incompatible with theism, is not known but only\nreasonably believed (Schellenberg 1993, 2015), or because it affirms\nthat the fact in question, though known, is more unlikely on theism\nthan on some competing hypothesis (Maitzen 2006; Marsh 2013; Anderson\nand Russell forthcoming).\n\n(B) It is a matter of dispute whether nonbelief provides evidence for\natheism independently of evil. Those in favor of independence invite\nus to imagine a world with no pain, suffering, or moral\nvice/wrongdoing. No one in such a world would appeal to evil as\nevidence for atheism, but someone might appeal to nonbelief as\nevidence for atheism (van Inwagen 2002, 2008; Schellenberg 2010a).\nThose in favor of dependence tend to define \u201cevil\u201d more\nbroadly. For example, they might say that evils are just bad states of\naffairs, whether pain, suffering, or moral vice/wrongdoing, on the one\nhand, or nonbelief, on the other hand (Kvanvig 2002; Evans 2010).\nAlternatively, they might argue in an Augustinian spirit that, since\nevil just is a lack of a good that should exist, and since belief in\nGod\u2019s existence is a good that should exist, nonbelief is an\nevil. One can also affirm that nonbelief is evidence for atheism in\nthe absence of evil while still thinking that the evidential value of\nnonbelief in this world must account for its interaction with the\nexistence of suffering (Anderson and Russell forthcoming). Indeed, one\nmight argue that the interaction is this: if God has a reason to allow\nevil, then God has a reason to allow something to act as a defeater\nfor belief in God\u2019s existence (Dumsday 2016).\n\n(C) Even if nonbelief provides evidence for atheism independently of\nevil, critical responses to arguments from nonbelief and evil share\nimportant similarities. For example, just as some critics try to\nexplain why God permits evil, so some critics try to explain why God\npermits nonbelief. Moreover, just as some critics argue that we are in\nno position to say that there are no unknown reasons for God to permit\nevil, so some critics argue that we are in no position to say that\nthere are no unknown reasons for God to permit nonbelief. Furthermore,\njust as some critics deny the relevant facts about evil, so some\ncritics deny the relevant facts about nonbelief. In addition, just as\nsome people say evil provides evidence against theism only if we\nconceive of God in certain ways, and so we should conceive of God\ndifferently, so some people say that nonbelief provides evidence\nagainst theism only if we conceive of God in certain ways, and so we\nshould conceive of God differently. Finally, just as some people grant\nthat evil gives atheism some weight and yet insist that other things\ngive theism much more weight, so some people grant that nonbelief\ngives atheism some weight and yet insist that other things give theism\nmuch more weight.\n\n(D) We can see another connection between arguments from evil and\nnonbelief by way of one of William Rowe\u2019s evidential arguments\nfrom evil. Obviously enough, there is horrific suffering in the world;\nbut, says Rowe, God exists only if there is a reason for God to permit\nsuch suffering. However, since there is no reason that we know of,\nit\u2019s reasonable to infer that there is no reason, period (Rowe\n1979). Thus, it\u2019s reasonable to infer that God does not exist.\nSome critics question the reasonableness of Rowe\u2019s inference\nfrom \u201cthere is no reason we know of\u201d to \u201cthere is no\nreason, period\u201d, on the grounds that it assumes that we are in a\ngood position to tell whether there is a reason, an assumption they\nregard as dubious since it would not be the least bit surprising if\nthere were a reason that was accessible to God but not to us. These\ncritics are too quick, however. For we must distinguish two ways in\nwhich we might be in a good position to tell whether something exists.\nThe first way is direct: we are in a position to see or mentally\napprehend it for ourselves. The second way is indirect: although we\nare not in a good position to see or mentally apprehend it for\nourselves, we are in a good position to see or apprehend something\nelse and, seeing or apprehending that other thing, we are in a good\nposition to infer reasonably that the first thing exists. The critics\nare too quick because they ignore the second, indirect way in which we\nmight be in a good position to tell whether something exists. This is\nwhere nonbelief might come into play. For one might argue that if\nGod\u2019s reasons for permitting a person to undergo horrific\nsuffering were inaccessible to them, then God would make it clear to\nthem that there is such a reason through clear assurances of\nGod\u2019s love and care, clear enough so that they are in a good\nposition to believe that God has a reason to permit their suffering.\nBut many people who suffer do not believe that God has a reason to\npermit their suffering, not least because they do not believe that God\nexists. So it is that nonbelief arguably vindicates Rowe\u2019s\nassumption and inference (Bergmann 2001; Howard-Snyder 1992, 1996b;\nRowe 2001; Trakakis 2007b).\n\n(E) An additional connection between evil and nonbelief consists in\ntrying to use various theistically friendly explanations of the facts\nabout evil to address concerns regarding the facts about nonbelief\nand, conversely, trying to use various theistically friendly\nexplanations of the facts about nonbelief to address concerns\nregarding the facts about evil. For example, one might argue that just\nas deep responsibility for each other\u2019s wellbeing explains\nGod\u2019s permission of some sin and suffering, so it explains\nGod\u2019s permission of some nonbelief (Swinburne 1998). Or,\nalternatively, if there is a good reason for God to permit nonbelief,\nthen God also has good reason not to intervene systematically to\nprevent or undo the consequences of wrongdoing (for if God did so\nintervene, God\u2019s existence would be clear enough to prevent\nnonbelief), and so God has some reason to permit some of the suffering\nthat is a natural consequence of wrongdoing (Dumsday 2015c).\n\n(F) Just as we must distinguish evil providing an argumentative basis\nfor atheism from evil providing a non-argumentative basis for atheism,\nso we must distinguish nonbelief providing an argumentative basis for\natheism from nonbelief providing a non-argumentative basis for\natheism. In the case of evil, this might work by\n\u201cseeing right there in the evil that the world was\nGodless or that the evil was so repugnant as to be irredeemable\u201d\n(Gellman 2013: 11). Likewise, in the case of nonbelief, this might\nwork by seeing right there in the nonresistant nonbeliever that the\nworld was Godless or that the nonresistant nonbelief was so repugnant\nas to be divinely impermissible.\n",
