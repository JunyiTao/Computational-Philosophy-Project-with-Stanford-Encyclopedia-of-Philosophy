Intention and Specification\n\nIntention refers to a cognitive state outside the computational system\nwhich expresses the formulation of a computational problem to be\nsolved.\u00a0Specifications describe the functions that the\ncomputational system to be developed must fulfil. Whereas\nintentions,\u00a0per se, do not pose\u00a0specific\nphilosophical controversies inside\u00a0the philosophy of computer\nscience, issues arise in connection with the definition of what a\nspecification is and its relation with intentions.\n",
