    "main_text": "Epistemology || The Problem of Religious Diversity\n9.6 The Problem of Religious Diversity\n\nEssentialists and others often rely on the alleged uniformity of\nclaims of mystics around the world. In William James\u2019s words,\nthere is an alleged \u201ceternal unanimity\u201d among mystics\n(James 1958, 321). But as he also realized, \u201cif we take the\nlarger mass as seriously as religious mysticism has historically taken\nitself, we find that the supposed unanimity largely\ndisappears\u201d (James 1958, 325). Constructivists in particular\nemphasize the diversity of mystical experiences, indeed for\nthem each mystical experience is utterly unique.\n\nDiversity of claims, and especially any genuinely conflicting claims,\nwould impact the Argument from Experience for the epistemic value of\nmystical experiences. In the history of religions, we find innumerable\ngods, with different characteristics. Shall we say they all exist? Can\nbelief in all of them be rational? In addition, there are experiences\nof non-personal ultimate realities, such as the Brahman of Advaita\nVedanta. Brahman cannot be an ultimate reality if God is\n(Hick 1984, 234\u2013235) since it is devoid of all personal\nfeatures. Furthermore, different theistic faiths claim experience of\nthe one and only God, ostensibly justifying beliefs that are in\ncontradiction with one another (see Flew 1966, 126). If theistic\nmystical experiences lead to such contradictory results,\nthey cannot provide evidence in favor of their validity\nas experiences of God.\n\nConflicting mystical claims thus lead to the issue of the\nreliability of mystical experiences as a source of\nknowledge: whatever the correct understanding of each type of mystical\nexperience is, many (perhaps most) mystics have\nmisunderstood their own experiences. Mystical experiences may put\nmystics in contact with a previously unrealized reality, but\nmystics\u2019 diverse and conflicting understandings of that reality\ndamaged their claim to have gained actual knowledge. Once mystics are\naware of competing claims, whether the experiences can be\nauthoritative even for the experiencers themselves, as James believed\n(James 1958, 324, 414), becomes an issue.\n\nIn reply, many discount experiences of polytheistic gods straight away\nbecause of their being embedded in settings we today take to be\nbizarre, and because of the relative paucity of reports of actual\nexperiences of such beings. Regarding clashing experiences within\ntheistic settings, Richard Swinburne (1991, 266) has proposed an\nascent to generality as a harmonizing mechanism. He believes that\nconflicting descriptions of the objects of religious experience pose a\nchallenge only to detailed doctrinal claims, not to general claims of\nhaving experienced a supernal being.\n\nPhilosophers and theologians may rank different types of mystical\nexperiences according to their cognitive importance. For example,\nMichael Stoeber ranks theistic experiences occurring after a mystical\nexperience empty of all differentiated content to be higher in\nimportance, calling them \u201ctheo-monistic\u201d experiences (Stoeber\n1994). But Advaitins would discount all theistic\nexperiences as instances in which the mind is not yet clear of\nillusory content.\n\nJohn Hick (1984, chap. 14) has proposed a pluralistic\nhypothesis to deal with the problem. According to this\nhypothesis, the great world faiths embody different perceptions and\nconceptions of one reality that Hick christens \u201cthe Real.\u201d The\nReal itself is indescribable and is never experienced\ndirectly but has \u201cmasks\u201d or \u201cfaces\u201d that depend on\nhow a particular culture or religion thinks of the Real that are\nexperienced. The Real itself is, therefore, neither personal nor\nnonpersonal, these categories being imposed upon the Real by different\ncultural contexts. Hence, the typical experiences of the major faiths\nare to be taken as validly of the Real through mediation by the\nlocal face of the Real.\n\nHick has been criticized for infidelity to the world\u2019s religious\ntraditions (d\u2019Costa 1987). However, Hick is providing\na second-order philosophical theory about the nature of\nreligions rather than an exposition of religions themselves that\nmembers necessarily would endorse.\n\nSome propose harmonizing some conflicting experiences by reference to\nGod\u2019s \u201cinexhaustible fullness\u201d (Gellman 1997, chap.\n4). In at least some mystical experiences of God, a subject\nexperiences what is presented as proceeding from an intimation of\ninfinite plenitude. Given this feature, a claim to experience a\npersonal ultimate (God) can be squared with an experience of a\nnonpersonal ultimate (e.g., the \u201cunspeakable\u201d Dao): the same one\nreality can be experienced in its personal attributes or in its\nnonpersonal attributes from out of its inexhaustible plenitude\n\u2014 e.g., nontheists experience the sheer being of the reality\nwhile theists experience its personal nature.\n\nWhether any of these solutions succeed, the body of experiential data\nis too large to simply scrap on the grounds of contradictory\nclaims. We should endeavor to retain as much of the conflicting data\nas possible by seeking some means of conciliation.\n\nBut it must be noted that religious theorists are just as willing\nas naturalists to tell mystics that they are mistaken about the\ncontent of their experiences. For example, Caroline Franks Davis has\nto twist the Advaitins\u2019 and Buddhists\u2019 accounts to show\nthat mystical experiences really support a \u201cbroad theism\u201d \u2014\ni.e., Shankara was really experiencing God although he explicitly\nargued that the nonpersonal and non-loving Brahman alone is real, and\nthe Buddha was totally unaware that he was experiencing a god. She\nclaims that all mystics, despite what they say, really experience \u201ca\nloving presence . . . with whom individuals can have a personal\nrelationship\u201d (Franks Davis 1989, 191). That is just what\none would expect someone raised a Christian to see as the true\n\u201ccommon core\u201d of all mystical experiences. But the same\nprocess, mutatis mutandis, would be available for nontheists\nraised in other traditions for their claims. \n\nAs things stand, the diversity problem raises the issue of how much is\ngiven in mystical experiences and how much is a matter of\ninterpretation based on a tradition\u2019s beliefs. This limits how much\nactual knowledge mystics can claim.\n",
