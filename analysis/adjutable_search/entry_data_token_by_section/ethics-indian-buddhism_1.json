    "main_text": "Forms of Buddhist Ethics\n2. Forms of Buddhist Ethics\n\nThe lineages of Buddhism that have survived to the present day can be\ngrouped into three traditions: Therav\u0101da, Mah\u0101y\u0101na, and\nVajray\u0101na. The Therav\u0101da, or \u201cTeaching of the\nElders,\u201d is the dominant form of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and in\nthe Southeast Asian nations of Thailand, Cambodia, Burma, and Laos.\nThe Mah\u0101y\u0101na, or \u201cGreat Way,\u201d originated in\nIndia, but is now the principal form of Buddhism in the Chinese\ncultural sphere, which includes China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. East\nAsian forms of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na are outside the scope of this\narticle, but I will discuss Indian texts from the early period of this\ntradition. The Vajray\u0101na, or \u201cDiamond Way,\u201d is\npracticed by Buddhists in the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia,\nincluding Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and Mongolia. A small number of\nJapanese Buddhists also belong to the Vajray\u0101na.\n\nBoth historically and doctrinally, the principal difference between\nthe Therav\u0101da and the Mah\u0101y\u0101na lies in the goals they\nrecommend. Most Therav\u0101da practitioners aspire to become Saints\n(Skt. Arhat, P\u0101li Arahant). The life in which\nsomeone becomes a Saint is that person\u2019s last life; this person\nwill no longer be reborn, but will instead enter Nirvana at death. A\nsmall minority of Therav\u0101dins, however, aspire to become Buddhas.\nAs they understand that goal, a Buddha is someone who rediscovers the\ntruths of Buddhism after they have been lost to the world, and teaches\nthem to others so as to benefit them. The Therav\u0101da tradition\nmaintains that, like Saints, Buddhas pass into Nirvana at death.\nBecoming a Buddha is believed to be more difficult and take more time\nthan becoming a Saint; it is a demanding path for a small minority. A\npractitioner who is on the way to becoming a Buddha is known in\nSanskrit as a bodhisattva (P\u0101li bodhisatta).\n\nBy contrast, all serious Mah\u0101y\u0101nists take the bodhisattva\nvow, promising to become Buddhas in order to help all beings. Indeed,\nsome scholars have concluded that the Mah\u0101y\u0101na movement\nbegan within the framework of early Buddhism as a group of\npractitioners holding the same doctrines and embracing the same\nrituals as their fellow Buddhists, and distinguished only by their\ncommon choice to follow the path to Buddhahood. However, over time,\nmany other differences evolved. In particular, mature\nMah\u0101y\u0101na traditions tend to hold that those who have become\nBuddhas, even after they die, continue to manifest in various forms\nand in various parts of cyclic existence in order to carry on the work\nof benefiting beings. They will remain in cyclic existence until all\nsentient beings have reached liberation.\n\nFollowers of Vajray\u0101na also embrace the commitment to become\nBuddhas for the benefit of all beings. The Vajray\u0101na can be seen\nas a branch of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na, since it shares the same\nspiritual goal. The main differences between the Vajray\u0101na and\nother forms of Mah\u0101y\u0101na concern ritual, iconography, and\nmeditation techniques. Those who practice Vajray\u0101na seek to\nattain Mah\u0101y\u0101na goals using Tantric means.\n\nThe Therav\u0101da is the only surviving tradition of Buddhism that is\nnot Mah\u0101y\u0101na. But at one time, there were many such\ntraditions: eighteen, according to one influential classification.\nHowever, apart from the Therav\u0101da, all of these traditions have\ndied out. There is no generally accepted term to refer collectively to\nall the Buddhist lineages that held Sainthood as their primary\nspiritual aspiration. In Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts, these forms of\nBuddhism are called H\u012bnay\u0101na, the \u201clesser\nvehicle\u201d, a pejorative term. More neutrally, these texts\nsometimes refer to Buddhists who aspire to Sainthood as Disciples\n(Skt. \u015ar\u0101vaka) and their path as the Way of the\nDisciples (Skt. \u015ar\u0101vaka-y\u0101na). Some scholars\nhave proposed the term \u201cMainstream Buddhism.\u201d\n\nMah\u0101y\u0101na texts repeatedly affirm the superiority of their\napproach to the non-Mah\u0101y\u0101na forms of Buddhist practice.\nAccording to these texts, the Disciples wish to attain Nirvana for\nthemselves alone, so that they disregard the needs of others. Since\nthey choose a less difficult path, their aspiration is inferior. Since\nthey propose to abandon other beings trapped in the prison of cyclic\nexistence, on this account, the Disciples lack compassion.\n\nThese criticisms may be unfair; it can be argued that they are\ndirected at a straw man and not at the real Therav\u0101da tradition.\nMost lineages of Buddhism, including the Therav\u0101da, value and\npractice the Four Divine Abidings (P\u0101li\nbrahma-vih\u0101ra), also known as the Four Immeasurables.\nThese are lovingkindness (P\u0101li metta), compassion\n(karu\u1e47\u0101), joy (pamudita) and equanimity\n(upekkh\u0101). The content of lovingkindness is a wish for\nothers to be happy. Lovingkindness, which can be a very enjoyable\nstate, is a kind of opening to others and to the reality of their\nlives. The content of compassion is a wish for others to be free from\nsuffering. This quality makes it possible to be fully aware and\npresent in the face of others\u2019 suffering. Joy is traditionally\nunderstood as the ability to rejoice in the happiness and good\nqualities of others. To operate in someone, joy requires the absence\nof envy, jealousy and self-hatred. Equanimity makes it possible to see\nsituations as they are, without preference or prejudice. It makes it\npossible to extend the other three Divine Abidings equally to all\nbeings.\n\nMost emotions that ordinary people experience are overcome or\ntransformed by the path; someone who was fully awake would not abide\nin or act from greed, hatred, competitiveness, or pride, for example.\nBut the Four Divine Abidings are emotions in which awake people rest\nand from which they act. Not only are these qualities recognized in\nthe Therav\u0101da, they are extensively practiced in that tradition.\nIn fact, the Metta Sutta, the Discourse on\nLovingkindness, is one of the most important and frequently\nrecited scriptures in Southeast Asia today. Any discussion of\nsimilarities and differences between Therav\u0101da and\nMah\u0101y\u0101na should take these facts into account.\n\nThe Mah\u0101y\u0101na path to awakening, like many textual\ndiscussions of that path, is organized around the qualities known as\nthe Six Perfections (Skt. p\u0101ramit\u0101). The Six\nPerfections are:\n\nGenerosity (d\u0101na)\nMoral discipline (\u015b\u012bla)\nPatient endurance (k\u1e63\u0101nti)\nPerseverance (v\u012brya)\nMeditative stability (dhy\u0101na)\nWisdom (praj\u00f1\u0101)\n\n\nK\u1e63\u0101nti, the third perfection, is a complex\nconcept, difficult to render with a single English word. It has three\nmain aspects. One is the ability to endure and maintain one\u2019s\ncalm and clarity of intention in the face of obstacles such as\nfrustrations, delays, and unpleasant sensations.\n\u201cPatience\u201d would be a plausible translation for this\naspect of k\u1e63\u0101nti. The second, and most important,\naspect of the perfection is the ability to remain peaceful, not\nbecoming angry, when other people harm us or cause difficulties for\nus. This second and primary aspect could justify a translation as\n\u201cforbearance\u201d. When insulted, someone with strong moral\ndiscipline would not retaliate, but might become angry and restrain\nthe expression of the anger; someone with strong patient endurance\nwould not become angry in the first place. The term\nk\u1e63\u0101nti is also often used to refer to the ability\nto remain calm and not react with fear or anger when hearing\npresentations of the ultimate truth, the way things really are.\n\nPerseverance, the fourth perfection, is the ability to pour energy\nenthusiastically into constructive activities that benefit oneself and\nothers. Meditative stability, the fifth perfection, is the ability to\nmaintain clear, stable attention during meditation practice. Though\nthoughts may arise during meditation, they do not cause distraction in\nsomeone with strong meditative stability, but merely appear as\nmovements of mind. Praj\u00f1\u0101, which could be\ntranslated as \u201cwisdom\u201d or as \u201cdiscernment,\u201d is\ndifficult to define and varies subtly in meaning among different\nBuddhist lineages. This quality allows those who have it to make\ndistinctions between phenomena and to understand things as they\nactually are. It is often described as intuitively based and can only\npartially be put into words.\n\nThe term p\u0101ramit\u0101, which I have been translating as\n\u201cperfection,\u201d could also be rendered as\n\u201ctranscendence.\u201d In order to awaken fully, a bodhisattva\nmust train in these qualities so deeply as to transcend how they are\nordinarily understood. This is done by achieving what is known as\n\u201cthe threefold purity,\u201d meaning that the bodhisattva does\nnot regard either herself, the action being performed, or the object\nof that action as being a real, objectively existing thing. So, for\nexample, someone who thinks that he has a substantial self and is\ngiving real food to an objectively existing recipient would be showing\nworldly generosity. But someone who can give while regarding herself,\nthe gift, and the recipient as like mirages, existing only from a\ncertain point of view and not in objective reality, can practice the\ntransmundane perfection of generosity.
