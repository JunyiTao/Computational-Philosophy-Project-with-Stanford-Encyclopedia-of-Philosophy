    "main_text": "Extensions of Classical Quantificational Logic || Propositional Quantifiers\n3.5 Propositional Quantifiers\n\nIt is not uncommon to let the vocabulary of classical quantificational\nlogic include 0-place predicates, which are treated as propositional\nvariables. This approach makes propositional logic a proper fragment\nof pure quantificational logic, and it construes quantification into\nthe position of a sentence as a species of second-order\nquantification, i.e., quantification into the position of a 0-place\npredicate.\n\nOr we may supplement the language of propositional logic with a\npropositional quantifier, \\(\\forall\\), which is allowed to bind\npropositional letters such as \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\), \u2026. This is,\nfor example, the course of action taken by Prior (1971), who outlines\na system of propositional quantification. Prior insisted that\npropositional quantification should not be confused with either\nobjectual quantification over propositions or substitutional\nquantification over sentences. Rather, propositional quantification is\na species of non-nominal quantification, since it is quantification\ninto sentence position.\n3.5.1 Quantified Propositional Logic\n\nThe vocabulary of quantified propositional logic contains\npropositional letters \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\), \\(p_1\\), \u2026 and\npropositional connectives \\(\\neg, \\rightarrow, \\wedge, \\vee,\n\\leftrightarrow\\). We may as usual treat \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\rightarrow\\)\nas primitive and take the others as defined. The usual recursive\ndefinition of a formula for propositional logic is appropriately\nsupplemented with a clause that states that \\(\\forall p A\\) is a\nformula whenever \\(A\\) is a formula.\n3.5.2 Axioms for Propositional Quantification\n\nThe axioms for propositional quantification are direct counterparts of\n\\((\\forall 1)-(\\forall 3)\\). Call a sentence \\(B\\) free for a\npropositional variable \\(p\\) in \\(A\\) if, and only if, no free\noccurrences of \\(p\\) lies within the scope of a quantification on\n\\(q\\), \\(\\forall q\\) or \\(\\exists q\\), where \\(q\\) is a propositional\nvariable which occurs in \\(B\\). Now:\n\n(\\(\\forall^{P}1\\)) \\(\\forall\np A \\rightarrow A(B/p)\\)\n\nprovided \\(B\\) is free for \\(p\\) in \\(A\\).\n(\\(\\forall^{P}2\\)) \\(\\forall\np(A \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow (A \\rightarrow\n\\forall pB)\\)\n\nprovided \\(p\\) is not free in \\(A\\).\n(\\(\\forall^{P}3\\)) from\n\\(A\\), to infer \\(\\forall p A\\)\n\n\nFor a taste of what they can do, notice that they yield a succinct\njustification of a rule of Uniform Substitution, whereby a formula of\nthe form \\(A(B/p)\\) is a theorem whenever \\(A\\) is a theorem, provided\nthat \\(B\\) is free for \\(p\\) in \\(A\\). So, for example, if\n\\(p\\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p)\\) is a theorem, then \\(\\neg r\n\\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow \\neg r)\\) is likewise a theorem, since this\nlast formula is just \\(p\\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p)(\\neg\n r/p)\\).[14]\n\nThe axioms immediately deliver every instance of a propositional\ncomprehension schema as a theorem:\n\n \\(\\exists p(p\n\\leftrightarrow A)\\),\n\nprovided \\(p\\) is not free in \\(A\\).\n\n\nThis is one important difference with respect to second-order\nquantification generally, since we are not automatically able derive\nevery instance of second-order comprehension from the other\nquantificational axioms. On the other hand, a simple instance of\nexistential generalization allows one to move from suitable formulas\nof the form \\(A \\leftrightarrow A\\) to an instance of propositional\ncomprehension of the form \\(\\exists p(p \\leftrightarrow A)\\). \n3.5.3 Propositional Quantification and Truth\n\nPropositional quantification has been used in order to present a\ndeflationary theory of truth. Grover, Camp, & Belnap (1975) and\nGrover (1992) have, for example, proposed to make use of propositional\nquantification in order to provide a variation on Ramsey\u2019s\nredundancy theory of truth. The main claim they make is that we can\nconceive of phrases like \u201cthat is true\u201d or \u201cit is\ntrue\u201d as protosentences, which are supposed to stand to\nsentences as pronouns stand to nouns; unlike pronouns like\n\u201cit\u201d, protosentences occupy sentence position, but just\nlike pronouns may be used for purposes of cross-reference to earlier\nnouns, protosentences may be used for purposes of cross-reference to\nsentences uttered earlier in a conversation. Thus phrases like\n\u201cthat is true\u201d or \u201cit is true\u201d are akin to\npropositional variables, which may be bound by propositional\nquantifiers.\n3.5.4 Intensional Paradoxes\n\nPrior (1961) makes use of propositional quantification in order to\nprovide an intensional version of the Liar Paradox. In particular, if\n\\(T\\) is a sentential operator of the appropriate sort, then the\nfollowing is a consequence of the axioms for propositional\nquantification:\n\n(P) \\(T \\forall p(Tp\n\\rightarrow \\neg p) \\rightarrow (\\exists p(Tp \\wedge p) \\wedge\n\\exists p(Tp \\wedge \\neg p))\\)\n\n\nIf we take \\(T\\) as Prior did, to stand for the sentential operator\n\u201cIt is said by a Cretan that\u201d, then we may read the\ntheorem as the claim that if it is said by a Cretan that whatever is\nsaid by a Cretan is not the case, then there are at least two things\nsaid by a Cretan. So, quite unexpectedly, we learn that it is\ninconsistent to assume that the only thing said by a Cretan is that\nnothing a Cretan says is the case.\n\nPrior\u2019s observation makes no special appeal to special\nprinciples governing the behavior of the sentential operator he chose,\nand the result carries over to a range of propositional attitude\noperators such as \u201cS believes that\u201d, \u201cS hopes\nthat\u201d, \u201cS writes on the board at midnight that\u201d,\netc. It is, for example, inconsistent to suppose that the only thing S\nwrites on the board at midnight is that everything S writes on the\nboard at midnight is false. \n\nKaplan (1995) makes use of a related observation to raise a problem\nfor the standard model theory for quantified propositional modal\nlogic. He observed, in particular, that if \\(Q\\) is a sentential\noperator of the appropriate sort, then the sentence (K) below is not\nsatisfiable in anny possible worlds model \\(\\langle W, \\mathcal{I}\n\\rangle\\) consisting of a set of possible worlds \\(W\\) and an\ninterpretation function, \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) assigning a set of sets of\npossible worlds to the sentential operator:\n\n(K) \\(\\forall p\n\\Diamond \\forall q (Qq \\leftrightarrow p=q)\\) \n\n\nWhen we let the propositional quantifier range over sets of worlds in\n\\(W\\), we find that Kaplan\u2019s sentence can only be satisfied in\nsuch a model if there is a map from the set of sets of worlds in \\(W\\)\ninto \\(W\\), which is not possible on account of Cantor\u2019s\ntheorem. Kaplan thought this is a problem because the model theory for\nquantified propositional model should not unduly constrain the space\nof intuitive possibilities. If we interpret \\(Qp\\) to mean that \\(p\\)\nis Queried, i.e., it is asked whether it is the case that \\(p\\), then\n(K) states that for every proposition, \\(p\\), it is possible that\n\\(p\\) and only \\(p\\) is Queried.\n\nThe two observations are related. Prior\u2019s theorem provides a\nwitness to the claim that some propositions cannot be Queried\nuniquely. If the proposition expressed by the condition \\(\\forall\np(Qp\\rightarrow \\neg p)\\) is the only proposition that is Queried,\nthen it is true if and only if it is false. So, it can only be Queried\nif it is false. But it is false only if something true is\n Queried.[15]\n\n3.5.5 Quantified Propositional Modal Logic\n\nPropositional quantification made an early appearance in Lewis,\nLangford, & Lamprecht 1932, which is commonly acknowledged to have\npioneered the study of modal logic. They outlined a formal system of\nmodal logic with propositional quantification, which they used to\nformulate an Existence Postulate designed to guarantee the\nexistence of at least two propositions that are consistent and\nindependent from each other. (This is postulate B9 in the entry on the\n modern origins of modal logic.)\n They used the postulate to make sure strict implication did not\ncollapse into material\n implication.[16]\n\nKripke (1959), Fine (1970), and Kaplan (1970) went on to consider\nsystems of propositional modal logic supplemented with propositional\nquantifiers governed by appropriate axioms and rules of inference.\nMoreover, they explained how to generalize the Kripkean model theory\nfor propositional modal logic in order to accommodate the presence of\npropositional quantification. A Kripke model for the language of\npropositional modal logic is an ordered triple, \\(\\langle W, R,\n\\mathcal{I} \\rangle\\), in which \\(W\\) is a non-empty set of worlds,\n\\(R\\) is a binary relation on \\(W\\), and \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) is an\ninterpretation function, which can be taken to assign a set of\npossible worlds to each sentence letter in the language. This suggests\nwe interpret propositional quantification in terms of quantification\nover sets of worlds in \\(W\\). An assignment of values to the\npropositional variables \\(s\\) will map each propositional variable\ninto a set of worlds, and we define satisfaction at a world by an\nassignment \\(s\\) as usual, except for an appropriate clause for the\nquantifier: \\(\\forall p A\\) is satisfied at a world \\(w\\) in \\(W\\)\nin \\(\\langle W, R, \\mathcal{I} \\rangle\\) by assignment \\(s\\) if, and\nonly if, \\(A\\) is satisfied at \\(w\\) by every assignment \\(s[p/S]\\) in\nwhich \\(S\\) is a subset of \\(W\\). The definitions of truth at a world\nand truth in a Kripke model then proceed as usual.\n\nThe axioms for propositional quantification are sound with respect to\nthe class of extended Kripke models for quantified propositional modal\nlogic. Unfortunately, they are not complete with respect to the same\nclass, since they do not allow us to derive the following as a\ntheorem:\n\n \\(\\exists p(p \\wedge\n\\forall q(q \\rightarrow \\Box (p \\rightarrow q)))\\)\n\n\nHowever, this formula is valid in every extended Kripke model for the\nsimple reason that its truth at a world in a model only requires the\nexistence of a maximally specific proposition, one which is true at\nexactly one world.\n3.5.6 How to Understand Propositional Quantification\n\nThe question remains of how to understand quantification into sentence\nposition. One may in fact be tempted to assimilate propositional\nquantification to either singular quantification over propositions or\nto substitutional quantification over a range of sentences. While\nPrior (1971) and Grover (1972), for example, take propositional\nquantification to be importantly different from singular and\nsubstitutional quantification, Richard (1996) suggests that\npropositional quantification should at the end of the day be treated\nas a species of singular quantification, e.g., singular quantification\nover propositions. Indeed, one may be tempted by this option by\nreflecting on what we did above. We expanded the language of\npropositional modal logic with a new style of quantification, but the\nmodel theory explained the truth conditions associated with the\npropositional quantifier, \\(\\forall p A\\), in terms of singular\nquantification over sets of worlds in the model.\n\nOne question is how to develop a fruitful model theory for the\nlanguage of quantified propositional logic and another question is\nwhether there is an intelligible interpretation of the formalism on\nwhich propositional quantification is construed as neither singular\nquantification over propositions nor as substitutional quantification\nover a range of sentences. One option at this point is to deny again\nthat the interpretation of propositional quantification should be\ndetermined by either the model theory for the language or by\ntranslation into some fragment of natural language. Indeed, one may\nadopt the line we mentioned above in connection to second-order\nquantification. The best method to learn what is meant by a\npropositional quantifier is through immersion and triangulation with\nnatural language by reflection on the fact that propositional\nquantifiers stand to sentences as first-order quantifiers stand to\nsingular terms. \n4. Quantification and Ontology\n\nMuch of contemporary ontology builds on the assumption that existence\nis to be understood in terms of quantification: in a slogan, to exist\nis to be something. Ontology is largely concerned with the domain of\nthe existential quantifier. This assumption can be traced\nback to the work of Frege and Russell, both of whom analyzed\nquantification in terms of predication, and plays a crucial role in\nQuine\u2019s admonition to transform ontology into the study of the\nontological commitments of our global theory of the world regimented\nin the language of quantificational logic and identity.\n4.1 Quantification, Predication, and Existence: Frege and Russell\n\nBy the link between quantification and existence, we mean the claim\nthat to exist is to be identical to something. This view can be traced\nback to Frege and Russell, who offered roughly the same broad analysis\nof quantification in terms of predication. The entry on\n existence\n provides a helpful overview and discussion of their account of\nexistence against the background of the historical context in which\nthey produced it. In what follows, we highlight a distinction between\nthe Frege-Russell analysis of quantification in terms of predication,\non the one hand, and the link between quantification and existence, on\nthe other.\n4.1.1 Quantification and Predication\n\nFrege (1980a, 1980b) explicitly analyzed quantification in terms of\npredication. For Frege, first-level predicates express concepts under\nwhich objects fall. A quantifier expresses a second-level concept\nunder which first-level concepts fall. In particular, he proposed to\ntake a sentence like (3) below to predicate of a first-level concept\nthat it has instances:\n\n(3) There is at least\none square root of 4.\n(4) The concept\nsquare root of 4 is instantiated.\n\n\nThe existential quantifier, \\(\\exists\\), is, for Frege, a second-level\npredicate, which expresses a second-level concept under which a\nfirst-level concept such as square root of 4 falls if and\nonly if it has some instances. Likewise, the universal quantifier,\n\\(\\forall\\), is a second-level predicate, which expresses a\nsecond-level concept under which a first-level concept such as\nself-identical falls if and only if it has all objects as\ninstances.\n\nRussell (1905) offered a similar account of quantification. On\nRussell\u2019s analysis, the proposition expressed by (5) predicates\nof a certain propositional function that it maps every object whatever\ninto a true proposition. (The entry on\n propositional functions\n provides more detail on the role of propositional functions in the\nearly development of modern logic.)\n\n(5)Everything is\nself-identical.\n(6)The propositional\nfunction \\(x\\) is self-identical is always true.\n\n\nThe propositional function \\(x\\) is self-identical maps the\nMoon to the true proposition that the Moon is self-identical, it maps\nthe Sun to the true proposition that the Sun is self-identical, etc.\nThe thrust of (5) is the proposition that no matter what object we\nsupply as argument, the propositional function \\(x\\) is\nself-identical will map it into a true proposition. The only\nsalient difference between Frege and Russell\u2019s account of\nquantification lies in the choice of concepts and propositional\nfunctions, respectively, as the objects of predication; while Frege\ntakes each quantifier to correspond broadly to a second-level concept,\nRussell analyzes them in terms of certain properties of propositional\nfunctions.\n4.1.2 Quantification and Existence\n\nBoth Frege and Russell combine their account of quantification in\nterms of predication with the substantive thesis that existence is to\nbe understood in terms of quantification. For Frege, existence is to\nbe identified with the second-level concept expressed by the\nsecond-level predicate expressed by \\(\\exists\\). For Russell,\nexistence is identified with a certain property of propositional\nfunctions, e.g., being sometimes true. This may seem overkill; if\ntrue, it might seem that only first-level concepts exist, not the\nobjects they instantiate. For only first-level concepts are instances\nof the second-level concept expressed by\n \\(\\exists\\).[17]\n Instead, they are mostly concerned with the thesis that statements of\nexistence such as (7) are not cases in which a primitive\nproperty of existence is predicated of an object, but rather should be\nunderstood as an implicitly quantified statement such as (8), which is\nto be analyzed in terms of predication in (9) and (10) for Frege and\nRussell, respectively:\n\n(7) 2\nexists.\n(8) Something is\nidentical to 2.\n(9) The concept\nidentical to 2 is instantiated.\n(10) The propositional\nfunction \\(x\\) is identical to 2 is sometimes\ntrue.\n\n\nThis point is perfectly compatible with the existence of a first-level\nconcept under which all and only those objects that exist fall. Take,\nfor example, the concept being self-identical. Likewise for\nRussell. The propositional function \\(x\\) is self-identical\nwill map all objects that exist into a true proposition.\n\nNote, however, that one could in principle retain their analysis and\ndeny, for example, that first-level concepts and propositional\nfunctions, respectively, can only be saturated by objects that exist.\nOne could take the view that some great philosophers who once existed,\nno longer exist. Socrates, for example, was a great philosopher who no\nlonger exists. He can nevertheless instantiate the first-level concept\nadmired by many philosophers. Or consider the bookcase I\nwould have built, had I finally assembled all the materials I\npurchased according to the assembly instructions that came with them.\nI have had concrete plans to build the bookcase for ages now; never\nmind the fact that I may never find the skill, time or energy to\nassemble it. My planned bookcase does not exist yet, and knowing\nmyself, it might well never exist. But one might take the view that we\ncan refer to it and that it instantiates many first-level concepts\nsuch as being a planned bookcase. On a view like this, the\nassertion that there are planned bookcases that do not exist would\nremain true even if none of its instances exist.\n\nA view like this would be classified as a form of Meinongianism by\nNelson (2012), and it would be subject to some of the difficulties\nother forms of Meinongianism face. Suffice it to say, for present\npurposes, that it would, however, require a radical departure from a\nvery influential approach to ontology advocated by Quine and endorsed\nby philosophers like Peter van Inwagen and David Lewis and their\nfollowers.\n4.2 Quine\u2019s Criterion of Ontological Commitment\n\nQuine (1948) explicitly characterizes ontology as an attempt to answer\nthe question \u201cwhat is there?\u201d As he observed, the question\nmay seem deceptively simple, since it may be answered in a word:\n\u201ceverything\u201d. The problem with this answer is that it is\nlargely uninformative. All parties agree that everything is something,\nbut there is still plenty of room of disagreement as to what kinds of\nobjects are there. Are there mereologically composite objects? Are\nthere concrete possible worlds? Are there mathematical objects? If\nthere are such objects, then they will of course lie in the domain of\nthe quantifier \u201ceverything\u201d. However, philosophers are\nstill intensely divided as to whether they do.\n\nQuine\u2019s strategy for the regimentation and resolution of\nontological disputes has informed much of contemporary ontology. He\nadvised philosophers to look at the ontological commitments incurred\nby our best global theory of the word\u2014best by ordinary\nscientific standards or principled extensions thereof\u2014when\nappropriately regimented in the language of pure quantificational\nlogic with\n identity.[18]\n One may perhaps think of the ontological commitments of our best\nglobal theory of the world as the demands that the truth of our total\ntheory imposes on the world. For example, we are committed to the\nexistence of objects of kind \\(K\\) if a proper regimentation of our\nbest global theory includes\u2014or entails\u2014a sentence of the\nform \\(\\exists x Fx\\), where \\(F\\) is a predicate under which only\nobjects of kind \\(K\\) fall. Quine\u2019s advice comes accompanied\nwith a criterion of ontological commitment whereby an appropriately\nregimented body of doctrine is ontologically committed to objects of\nkind \\(K\\) just in case objects of kind \\(K\\) must lie in the\nrange of our bound variables for the sentences of our theory to be\ntrue. More details are given in section 5 of the entry on\n Quine.\n\nAs Cartwright (1954) observed, it is far from clear how one is\nsupposed to interpret the modality in Quine\u2019s official\nformulation of the criterion. A purely extensional version of the\ncriterion is plainly inadequate: \\(T\\) is ontologically committed to\nobjects of kind \\(K\\) if, and only if, \\(T\\) is true only if\nthe variables range over objects of kind \\(K\\). But the material\nconditional is much too weak for Quine\u2019s purposes as it makes\nany false theory to be ontologically committed to all kinds of\n objects.[19]\n Quine\u2019s general hostility to non-extensional notions makes the\nproblem all the more delicate for him.\n\nUnder Quine\u2019s approach to ontology, an argument for the\nexistence of objects of kind \\(K\\)\u2014whether mereologically\ncomplex objects, or concrete possible worlds, or mathematical\nobjects\u2014takes the form of an argument for the thesis that\nquantification over such objects is indispensable to our best global\ntheory of the world. One of the most familiar instances of such\narguments is the Quine-Putnam argument for the existence of\nmathematical objects. Since mathematical objects are indispensable for\nscientific purposes, we should expect the quantifiers of our best\nglobal theory of the world to range over them. But once we settle the\nquestion of whether the quantifiers of our best global theory of the\nworld range over mathematical objects, we have settled the ontological\nquestion of whether such objects exist. The entry on\n indispensability arguments in mathematics\n includes extensive discussion of this and related indispensability\narguments in mathematics. Similar arguments have been deployed outside\nmathematics to argue for the existence of possible worlds,\nmereologically complex objects, and the like.\n\nThis brings us to a family of applications for different styles of\nquantification explored above. It is not uncommon to respond to\nindispensability arguments for the existence of objects of a certain\nkind by means of a paraphrase strategy, which if successful, would\nshow how to make do without the ontological commitment to objects of\nthe offending kind. Oftentimes, the paraphrase will involve a\ndifferent style of quantification, whether an alternative to classical\nquantification or an extension thereof. For example, Gottlieb (1980)\nattempted to respond to the Quine-Putnam indispensability argument for\nthe existence of numbers by dispensing with objectual quantification\nin favor of substitutional quantification in arithmetic. Burgess &\nRosen (1997) provides an extensive catalogue of different expressive\nresources philosophers have used in order to bypass apparent\ncommitment to mathematical objects. Or take the question, for example,\nwhether there are composite objects of various kinds. Dorr & Rosen\n(2002), Hossack (2000); and van Inwagen (1995) have each argued that\nplural quantification can be used to paraphrase away apparent\nontological commitment to composite objects\u2014other than organisms\nin van Inwagen\u2019s case: we need only replace apparent singular\nquantification over composite objects with plural quantification over\nits alleged parts, and replace apparent singular predications of a\ncomposite object with plural predications of their\n parts.[20]\n4.3 Unrestricted Quantification\n\nWhen Quine answers \u201ceverything\u201d to the fundamental\nontological question of what there is, he presumably intends the\nquantifier to range unrestrictedly over all objects at once. This\nobservation applies to ontological inquiry more generally. When a\nnominalist asserts that there are no mathematical objects, she does\nnot intend the thesis to be qualified by a restriction to a domain of\nconcrete objects; otherwise, the thesis would be devoid of interest.\nBut unrestricted quantification is not a very common phenomenon\noutside highly theoretical contexts such as logic and ontology. Take a\ntypical use of a quantifier expression in English as exemplified in a\ntypical utterance of the sentence:\n\n(11) Everything is on\nsale.\n\n\nIn a typical context, the use of the quantifier\n\u201ceverything\u201d is tacitly restricted to a domain of\ncontextually salient objects. In particular, it would be inappropriate\nfor another participant in the conversation to point out that the Moon\nis not on sale. The Moon is not an exception to the statement made by\nmy utterance of (11) because the Moon does not lie in the domain of\nquantification associated to my use of the quantifier.\n\nBut the fact that unrestricted quantification is relatively uncommon\nis no reason to doubt it is attainable in certain contexts.\nUnfortunately, many philosophers have recently doubted that genuinely\nunrestricted quantification is even coherent, much less\n attainable.[21]\n Note that these philosophers face at least two preliminary\nchallenges, both of which are forcefully pressed by Williamson (2003).\nFirst, they face the question of what to make of the prospects of\nontological inquiry without unrestricted generality. How should we\nformulate substantive ontological positions such as nominalism, if we\ncannot hope to quantify over all objects at once? The second challenge\nfor the skeptics is to state their own position. To the extent to\nwhich the thesis that we cannot quantify over everything appears to\nentail that there is something over which cannot quantify, skeptics\nseem to find themselves in a bind by inadvertently quantifying over\nwhat, by their own lights, lies beyond a legitimate domain of\n quantification.[22]\n Typical responses to each problem involve a surrogate for\nunrestricted generality in the form of either schematic generality or\nthe use of certain modal operators to simulate quantification over a\nseries of ever more comprehensive domains of\n quantification.[23]\n\nAt the core of the problem lies the assumption that the set-theoretic\nparadoxes cast doubt upon the existence of a comprehensive domain of\nall objects. What they reveal, according to Dummett (1991, 1993), is\nthe existence of indefinitely extensible concepts like set,\nordinal, and object. For Dummett, the indefinite\nextensibility of set is incompatible with the existence of a\ncomprehensive domain of all sets, since no matter what putative domain\nof all sets we isolate, we find that we can employ Russell\u2019s\nreasoning to characterize further sets that lie beyond the putative\ndomain of all sets with which we began. The set of all\nnon-self-membered sets in the initial domain cannot, on pain of\ncontradiction, be in that domain, which means that it must lie in a\nmore comprehensive domain of all sets. If there is no domain of all\nsets, there is, the thought continues, no hope for a domain of all\nobjects. One may respond to this line of argument by contesting\nDummett\u2019s diagnosis of the set-theoretic antinomies. Boolos\n(1993) suggests that we take Russell\u2019s paradox, for example, to\nestablish that not every condition determines a set. The moral of\nRussell\u2019s paradox is that there is no set of all\nnon-self-membered sets, not that it lies beyond the initial domain of\nquantification.\n\nFor another line of attack against the coherence of unrestricted\nquantification, one may ask what exactly is a domain of quantification\nsupposed to be. Skeptics often take a page from modern model theory\nand think of a domain of quantification as a set\u2014or at least as\na set-like object, which contains as members all objects over which\nthe putatively unrestricted quantifier is supposed to range. They take\nfor granted that for a speaker to be able to quantify over some\nobjects, they must all be members of some set-like object, which\nconstitutes a domain of quantification. Cartwright (1994) called this\nthesis the All-in-One Principle. Now, if there is unrestricted\nquantification, then the domain of quantification associated to it\ncannot be a set-like object. For we could then deploy a suitable\nvariation on Russell\u2019s paradox in order to obtain a\n contradiction.[24]\n Many have concluded from this that there is no genuinely unrestricted\nquantification over all objects at once.\n\nThe All-in-One principle is not beyond doubt. One application of\nplural quantification, which is explored by Cartwright (1994), is to\nabandon the All-in-One principle and to understand talk of a domain of\nquantification not as singular talk of collections but rather as\nplural talk of its members. To speak of a domain of certain objects is\njust to speak of the objects themselves\u2014or to speak of a\nfirst-level concept under which they all fall; and to claim of a given\nobject that it lies in the domain is to claim of the object that it is\none of them. Alternatively, one may opt for the expressive resources\nof second-order quantification with the second-order quantifiers taken\nto range over Fregean concepts. Williamson (2003) outlines a\nconception of a domain of quantification as a Fregean concept under\nwhich certain objects may fall. To speak of a domain of all objects on\nthis view is to speak of a Fregean concept under which all\nobjects\u2014without restriction\u2014fall, and to claim of a given\nobject that it lies in the domain is merely to claim that the object\nfalls under the relevant Fregean concept.\n4.4 Quantification, Tense and Modality\n\nThe combination of quantification and modality traces back to Barcan\n(1946, 1947) and Carnap (1946). Historically, however, this\ncombination came under sustained attack by Quine, who, like Carnap,\nassumed that \\(\\Box\\) could only interpreted in terms of logical\nnecessity or analyticity. As Carnap himself recognized, the linguistic\nconception of necessity raises the question of how to assign\nintelligible truth conditions to de re modal generalizations\nof the form \\(\\exists x \\Box\n Px\\).[25]\n For the truth conditions for such a sentence appear to require one to\nmake sense of the truth of an open formula of the form \\(\\Box Px\\)\nwith respect to an assignment of a value to the variable \\(x\\). If we\nread \\(\\Box\\) to mean: \u201cit is analytic that\u201d, then one may\nwonder what sense could be made of the claim that an open formula\n\\(Px\\) is analytic with respect to an assignment of an object to\n\\(x\\). Quine had anticipated the issue in Quine (1943), and he pressed\nthe criticism again in Quine (1953, 1960). Quine\u2019s objections\nare commonly taken not to apply to other interpretations of \\(\\Box\\)\nin terms of metaphysical necessity as discussed, for example, in\nKripke (1980). When we move past Quine\u2019s criticisms and combine\npure quantificational logic with propositional modal logic, we obtain\nquantified modal logic.\n\nThe interaction of quantification and modality turns out to raise\ndifficult philosophical problems. As we will see, some of these\ndifficulties have, in fact, inclined some philosophers to rethink the\nscope of pure quantificational logic. The problem is that certain\ntheorems of quantified modal logic suggest that everything is\nnecessarily something. The subject matter of ontology is necessary:\nnothing could have failed to be something.\n4.4.1 Quantification and Modality\n\nQuantified modal logic is the system that combines pure\nquantificational logic with propositional modal logic. Propositional\nmodal logic investigates the logic of the modal operators \\(\\Box\\) and\n\\(\\Diamond\\) and is discussed in the entry on\n modal logic.\n The language of propositional modal logic supplements the language of\npropositional logic with the sentential operator \\(\\Box\\), and\n\\(\\Diamond\\) may then be explicitly defined as \\(\\neg \\Box \\neg\\). A\nweak propositional modal logic called K logic includes as axioms all\ntautologies and all instances of schema K:\n\n(K)\\(\\Box(A \\rightarrow\nB) \\rightarrow (\\Box A \\rightarrow \\Box B)\\)\n\n\nThe rules of inference of the system include modus ponens and\nwhat is often known as a rule of necessitation:\n\n(RN)from \\(A\\), infer\n\\(\\Box A\\)\n\n\nThe combination of propositional modal logic and pure quantificational\nlogic is often called quantified modal logic and is discussed in\nsection 13 of the entry on\n modal logic\n and the entry on the\n possibilism-actualism debate.\n This combination immediately delivers what we may call the\nnecessity of being:\n\n(NB)\\(\\forall x \\Box\n\\exists y(x=y)\\)\n\n\nThe key to this observation is that the open formula \\(\\exists y (x =\ny)\\) is a theorem of pure quantificational logic. Successive\napplications of the rule of necessitation and universal generalization\nare all it takes to complete the proof.\n\nOn the alethic interpretation of \\(\\Box\\) in terms of metaphysical\nnecessity, this theorem reads as the claim that everything is\nnecessarily something. Take the Griffith Observatory, for example. It\nis a consequence of the theorem that it is necessarily something. The\nGriffith Observatory would have been something even if no funds had\nbeen available for construction and nothing had ever been built in the\nsite it occupies. And what is true of the Griffith Observatory is true\nof us: each of us is necessarily something. When we combine this\nresult with the link between quantification and existence, we conclude\nthat everything exists necessarily, which flies in the face of the\nassumption that we exist only contingently.\n\nWith the help of schema K, one may prove the Converse Barcan\nFormula:\n\n(CBF)\\(\\Box \\forall x A\n\\rightarrow \\forall x \\Box \\ A\\)\n\n\nOn the alethic interpretation of the modality, this states that if\nnecessarily, everything is \\(A\\), everything is necessarily \\(A\\). The\nproof is given, for example, in one of the supplements to the entry on\nthe\n possibilism-actualism debate.\n But this provides another route to the necessity of being: since\nnecessarily, everything is something, everything is necessarily\nsomething. In the presence of a further plausible modal principle, B,\nwe may even prove the Barcan Formula. The Brouwerian principle, B,\nstates that whatever is the case is necessarily, possibly the\ncase:\n\n(B)\\(A \\rightarrow \\Box\n\\Diamond A\\)\n\n\nThe Barcan Formula states that if everything is necessarily \\(A\\),\nthen necessarily, everything is \\(A\\):\n\n(BF)\\(\\forall x \\Box\nA \\rightarrow \\Box \\forall x A\\)\n\n\nOr, equivalently:\n\n\\(\\Diamond \\exists x\nA \\rightarrow \\exists x \\Diamond A\\)\n\n\nThe entry on the\n possibilism-actualism debate\n includes a supplement with a proof of BF against the background of\n(B). But this formula is deemed unacceptable by many philosophers.\nConsider my plans to build a bookcase. Even if I never manage to build\none, it is certainly possible for me to build one. So, it is possible\nfor there to be some bookcase I have built. By the Barcan Formula, it\nseems to follow that something is possibly a bookcase I build. The\nBarcan Formula does not settle whether or not this object is in fact a\nconcrete object, much less a bookcase one may in fact use to store\none\u2019s books. In fact, to deny this is one way to come to terms\nwith the Barcan Formula.\n4.4.2 Quantification and Tense\n\nWhat is true of the combination of pure quantificational logic with\npropositional modal logic is mutatis mutandis true of the\ncombination of pure quantificational logic and propositional tense\nlogic. Certain theorems of quantified tense logic suggest that\neverything has always been, is, and will always be something. The\ndomain of ontology is immutable: nothing ever fails to be\nsomething.\n\nPropositional tense logic investigates the logic of tense operators\nlike \\(H\\), read: \u201cit has always been the case that\u201d,\n\\(P\\), read: \u201cit was the case that\u201d, \\(G\\), read:\n\u201cit will always be the case that\u201d, and \\(F\\), read:\n\u201cit will be the case that\u201d. In place of K, we have\ndistribution axioms:\n\n\\(H(A \\rightarrow B)\n\\rightarrow (HA \\rightarrow HB)\\)\n\\(G(A \\rightarrow B)\n\\rightarrow (GA \\rightarrow GB)\\)\n\n\nAnd in place of the rule of necessitation, we have rules of temporal\ngeneralization:\n\nfrom \\(A\\), infer\n\\(HA\\)\nfrom \\(A\\), infer\n\\(GA\\)\n\n\nMore details are provided in the entry on\n temporal logic.\n\nThe combination of propositional tense logic and pure quantificational\nlogic immediately delivers the eternality of being:\n\n(EB)\\(\\forall x\n(G\\exists y(x = y) \\wedge \\exists y(x = y) \\ \\wedge F\\exists y(x =\ny))\\),\n\n\nwhich states that everything has has always been, is, and will always\nbe, something. The Griffith Observatory was something even before it\nwas built in 1935\u2014and will always be something\u2014even\nbillions of years from now. And what is true of the Griffith\nObservatory is true of us: each of us has always been, is, and will be\nsomething\u2014even before our birth and long after our death.\n\nQuantified tense logic proves temporal versions of CBF:\n\n\\(H \\forall xA\n\\rightarrow \\forall x H A\\)\n\\(G\\forall x A\n\\rightarrow \\forall x G A\\)\n\n\nAnd, finally, we have two temporal versions of BF:\n\n\\(\\forall x H A\n\\rightarrow H \\forall x A\\)\n\\(\\forall x G A\n\\rightarrow G \\forall x A\\)\n\n\nIn order to appreciate the difficulty, we may take the contrapositive\nof the temporal version of BF for \\(H\\), where \\(P\\) is defined as\nusual, as: \\(\\neg H \\neg\\):\n\n\\(P \\exists x A\n\\rightarrow \\exists x P A\\)\n\n\nWe infer, for example, that there were dinosaurs only if there are\npast dinosaurs. If to exist is to be something, then past dinosaurs\nexist. But whether this commits us to flesh-and-blood dinosaurs is of\ncourse a different matter, since being a past dinosaur need not\nrequire being a dinosaur.\n4.4.3 From Logic to Ontology\n\nThe interaction between pure quantificational logic and tense and\nmodality suggests the domain of ontology is immutable and necessary.\nBut we can only draw these conclusions by making use of some auxiliary\nassumptions, some of which are far from obvious. The highly\ncounterintuitive character of the conclusions has consequently led\nmany philosophers to place some of the auxiliary assumptions under\nclose scrutiny. Other philosophers have followed argument where it\nleads, and they have sought to reconcile the eternal and necessary\ncharacter of the domain of ontology with the apparent temporary and\ncontingent character of existence. In fact, Williamson 2013 set out to\nprovide a separate battery of arguments for the necessity and\nimmutability of ontology.\n\nOne auxiliary assumption one may question is the traditional link\nbetween quantification and existence. Even if there is no change in\nthe domain of quantification, you may nevertheless think that\nexistence is only temporary. Socrates did not exist either before 490\nBCE or after 399 BCE, and the mere fact that he is, has and will\nalways be something is not reason to attribute existence to him. One\nvariant of this move is a direct descendant of Meinong\u2019s view on\nexistence as a mere species of being. But to the extent to which\nMeinongianism may be accompanied with the implausible thesis that no\nmatter what condition we substitute for \\(F\\) in \u201cthe \\(F\\) is\n\\(F\\)\u201d gives rise to a true sentence, it would seem to entail\nthat \u201cthe round square is a round square\u201d is true, which\nseems hopeless. But the Meinongian thesis is not compulsory for more\nplausible developments of the view that not everything exists, even\nthough everything is\n something.[26]\n What is not negotiable, though, is the thesis that existence should\nnot be taken to be expressed by a quantificational expression, but\nrather by a predicate which may or not apply to objects in the domain.\nThe moral of the temporal versions of BF and CBF is only that\nunrestricted quantification ranges over an immutable and necessary\ndomain of objects, whether or not they enjoy temporary and contingent\nexistence. The difficult question remains of how to answer\nQuine\u2019s question \u201cwhat is there?\u201d once one abandons\nthe thesis that no matter what condition \\(F\\) may be, there are\nobjects that satisfy the condition. For more on different variants of\nMeinongianism, the reader may consult the entry on\n existence.\n\nThere is, in the second place, the assumption that the axioms of pure\nquantificational logic remain true when we expand the language to\ninclude other sentential operators, whether temporal, modal or\n otherwise.[27]\n What is perhaps the most common response to our predicament is to\nrecoil from pure quantificational logic into a suitably weakened\nvariant of it. This is, for example, the path taken in Kripke (1963),\nwhere Kripke proposes to weaken the axiom of universal instantiation\nin line with the first version of inclusive quantificational logic\ndiscussed earlier. Since \\(\\exists y(x = y)\\) is not a theorem of\ninclusive quantificational logic, we are not in a position to\nnecessitate, which blocks the derivation of the necessity of\n being.[28]\n Kripke\u2019s quantified modal logic is discussed in the entry on\nthe\n possibilism-actualism debate.\n Others have fallen back into alternative forms of free logic, but\nthere appears to be no consensus as to which one is the best\nalternative to pure quantificational logic. It may be helpful to note,\nhowever, that some of the relevant free logics merely restrict the\naxiom of universal instantiation by means of an existence predicate\nand do nothing to block the derivation of other allegedly problematic\nprinciples such as the necessity of identity, which is the thesis that\neverything is necessarily self-identical. Since, presumably, an object\ncan only be necessarily self-identical if it exists necessarily,\nopponents of CBF will also want to have some resources to block the\nnecessity of identity.\n\nThe derivability of the necessity of identity from the axioms of\nidentity and the rule of necessitation may perhaps invite one to\nconsider another option. Maybe the culprit is not pure\nquantificational logic, but rather the indiscriminate use of the rule\nof necessitation. The rationale for necessitation is that every\nprovable sentence should be necessarily true, but it is not clear how\nthis thought is supposed to generalize to open formulas, which,\nstrictly speaking, are not true or false. Open formulas are merely\ntrue or false under an assignment of values to their free variables.\nBut the fact that \\(x = x\\), for example, is true under an assignment\n\\(s\\) on which \\(x\\) is assigned a table is no reason to think that\n\\(x = x\\) is necessarily true under such an assignment if you think\nthat the table could have not been\nthere.[29]\nOne problem for\nthis strategy is that it is of little help when we allow closed terms\nsuch as constant symbols into the language of quantified modal\nlogic. In the presence of constant symbols, classical quantificational\nlogic allows us to derive the sentence \\(\\exists x (a = x)\\) as a\ntheorem, whence, by necessitation for complete sentences, we infer\n\\(\\Box \\exists x(a = x)\\), which seems objectionable if \\(a\\) is\nsuppose to regiment a name for an object that exists only\ncontingently. One could avoid the problems by barring closed terms\nfrom the language, but such a radical exclusion seems ad hoc\nand artificial. So, if one chooses to restrict necessitation, one must\nprovide a different rationale for it. Deutsch (1990) provides an\nexample of this strategy.\n\nThe fourth and final option to consider is to take the derivability of\nCBF in tense and modal logic at face value, and embrace the conclusion\nthat existence is indeed immutable and necessary. These are the theses\nthat Williamson (2013) calls \u201cpermanentism\u201d and\n\u201cnecessitism\u201d. The task for each approach is to explain\nour initial reluctance to embrace them in the first place. Take the\napparent resistance to accept the claim that Socrates will always be\nsomething despite the fact that he died in 399 BCE. The permanentist\nmay respond that if we are initially disinclined to accept this claim,\nit is only because we mistakenly think that because a person, for\nexample, is a concrete object, a past or a future person must be\nconcrete as well. Socrates, which is a past person, was not a person\neither before 490 BCE or after 399 BCE; indeed, Socrates is now not a\nperson, nor will he be one in the future. Likewise, a merely possible\nperson need not be a person either and neither the Barcan nor the\nConverse Barcan Formula threaten the temporary and contingent\ncharacter of concreteness. Since I could have found the time, skill\nand energy to build a bookcase, some object is possibly a bookcase\nbuilt by me. But the necessitist will be at pains to add that to be a\npossible bookcase built by me is not to be a bookcase built by me,\nmuch less a bookcase. This outlook is defended by Linsky & Zalta\n(1994) and Williamson (2013). But there are other points of contact.\nFor example, all versions of necessitism must reject unqualified\n\u201cessentialist\u201d theses such as the view that a person is\nnecessarily a person; at most, one can perhaps maintain the weaker\nthesis that a person is necessarily if concrete, a person. Likewise,\nall versions of necessitism seem committed to the actual existence of\nmany more nonsets than can form a set. Sider (2009), for example,\nargues that necessitism is committed to the actual existence of at\nleast \\(\\kappa\\) nonsets for each set-theoretic cardinal \\(\\kappa\\).\nAnd Hawthorne & Uzquiano (2011) raises other cardinality problems\nfor a combination of necessitism with certain common mereological\nassumptions.",
