    "main_text": "The Quantum Potential\n5. The Quantum Potential\n\nBohmian mechanics as presented here is a first-order theory, in which\nit is the velocity, the rate of change of position, that is\nfundamental. It is this quantity, given by\n the guiding equation,\n that the theory specifies directly and simply. The second-order\n(Newtonian) concepts of acceleration and force, work and energy do not\nplay any fundamental role. Bohm, however, did not regard his theory in\nthis way. He regarded it, fundamentally, as a second-order theory,\ndescribing particles moving under the influence of forces, among\nwhich, however, is a force stemming from a \u201cquantum\npotential\u201d.\n\nIn his 1952 hidden-variables paper, Bohm arrived at his theory by\nwriting the wave function in the polar form \\(\\psi =\nR\\)exp\\((iS/\\hslash)\\), where \\(S\\) and \\(R\\) are real, with \\(R\\)\nnonnegative, and rewriting Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation in terms\nof these new variables to obtain a pair of coupled evolution\nequations: the continuity equation for \\(\\varrho = R^2\\) and a\nmodified Hamilton-Jacobi equation for \\(S\\). This differs from the\nusual classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation only by the appearance of an\nextra term, the quantum potential \n\n\\[\nU = {-}\\sum_k (\\hslash^2 /2m_k) (\\partial_{k}^2 R / R ),\n\\]\n\n alongside the\nclassical potential energy term. \n\nBohm then used the modified Hamilton-Jacobi equation to define\nparticle trajectories just as one does for the classical\nHamilton-Jacobi equation, that is, by identifying \\(\\partial_k S\\)\nwith \\(m_k\\boldsymbol{v}_k\\), i.e., by setting \n\n\\[\nd\\mathbf{Q}_k /dt = \\partial_k S / m_k.\n\\]\n\n This is\nequivalent to\n the guiding equation\n for particles without spin. [In this form the (pre-Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation) de Broglie relation \\(\\boldsymbol{p} = \\hslash\n\\boldsymbol{k}\\), as well as by the eikonal equation of classical\noptics, already suggest the guiding equation.] The resulting motion is\nprecisely what would be obtained classically if the particles were\nacted upon by the force generated by the quantum potential, in\naddition to the usual forces.\n\nThe quantum potential formulation of the de Broglie-Bohm theory is\nstill fairly widely used. For example, the monographs by Bohm and\nHiley and by Holland present the theory in this way. And regardless of\nwhether or not we regard the quantum potential as fundamental, it can\nin fact be quite useful. In order to see most clearly that Newtonian\nmechanics should be expected to emerge from Bohmian mechanics in the\nclassical limit, it is convenient to transform the theory into\nBohm\u2019s Hamilton-Jacobi form. Then the (size of the) quantum\npotential provides a measure of the deviation of Bohmian mechanics\nfrom its classical approximation. Moreover, the quantum potential is\nalso useful for developing approximation schemes for solutions to\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation (Nerukh & Frederick 2000, Wyatt 2006).\n\nHowever, Bohm\u2019s rewriting of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation\nin terms of variables that seem interpretable in classical terms is\nnot without a cost. The most obvious is an increase in complexity:\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation is rather simple, and it is linear,\nwhereas the modified Hamilton-Jacobi equation is somewhat complicated,\nand highly nonlinear. Moreover the latter, since it involves \\(R\\),\nrequires the continuity equation for its closure. The quantum\npotential itself is neither simple nor natural. Even to Bohm it seemed\n\u201crather strange and arbitrary\u201d (Bohm 1980: 80). And it is\nnot very satisfying to think of the quantum revolution as amounting to\nthe insight that nature is classical after all, except that there is\nin nature what appears to be a rather ad hoc additional force\nterm, the one arising from the quantum potential. The artificiality\nthat the quantum potential suggests is the price one pays for casting\na highly nonclassical theory into a classical mold.\n\nMoreover, the connection between classical mechanics and Bohmian\nmechanics that the quantum potential suggests is rather misleading.\nBohmian mechanics is not simply classical mechanics with an additional\nforce term. In Bohmian mechanics the velocities are not independent of\npositions, as they are classically, but are constrained by the guiding\nequation. (In classical Hamilton-Jacobi theory we also have this\nequation for the velocity, but there the Hamilton-Jacobi function\n\\(S\\) can be entirely eliminated and the description in terms of \\(S\\)\nsimplified and reduced to a finite-dimensional description, with basic\nvariables the positions and the (unconstrained) momenta of all the\nparticles, given by Hamilton\u2019s or Newton\u2019s equations.)\n\nArguably, the most serious flaw in the quantum potential formulation\nof Bohmian mechanics is that it gives a completely false impression of\nthe lengths to which we must go in order to convert orthodox quantum\ntheory into something more rational. The quantum potential suggests,\nas has often been stated, that transforming Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\nequation into a theory that can account in \u201crealistic\u201d\nterms for quantum phenomena, many of which are dramatically nonlocal,\nrequires adding to the theory a complicated quantum potential of a\ngrossly nonlocal character. It should be clear that this view is\ninappropriate. After all, the quantum potential need not even be\nmentioned in the formulation of Bohmian mechanics, and it in\nany case merely reflects the wave function, which Bohmian mechanics\nshares with orthodox quantum theory.\n",
