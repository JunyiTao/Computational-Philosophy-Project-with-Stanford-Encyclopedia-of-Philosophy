    "main_text": "Ontology and Metaphysics || Sistology\n3.2 Sistology\n\n\nIn late life, Sylvan aimed at enriching the ideas defended in Routley\n(1980) by developing what he calls \u201csistology\u201d. On the one\nhand, sistology adopts all the fundamental ideas of noneism. Like\nnoneism, sistology includes items that do not exist (cf. Sylvan 1991,\n837; 1997, 11\u201312) and it accepts that those items have\nproperties (cf. 1991, 838\u201339). On the other hand, sistology\ndevelops and enriches noneism in the following ways.\n\n\nTo begin with, Sylvan tried to move the focus of his attention from\nthe existence (or non-existence) of items to their being\nitems. Using Sylvan\u2019s words, sistology is concerned with\n\u201call items as having standing\u201d (1991, 838).\nThus, sistology aims at casting a new light on what it means to be\nan item instead of showing that it is possible to have\nnon-existent items. The latter project was the unique task of\nnoneism.\n\n\nSecondly, Sylvan tried to extend and deepen the catalogue of items he\ndealt with in Routley (1980). In an unpublished manuscript, Sylvan\ndescribed an imaginary museum in which all sorts of items are\naccepted. Among those items that have not been (comprehensively)\ndiscussed in his (1980), Sylvan listed:\n\nvacancies, vacuums (such as holes, empty bowls,\nvalleys, and absences);\nwholes, aggregations (such as the totality, everything,\nthe universal set, and the Cosmos);\nsignificant ideological objects (such as the Tao,\nBuddhist ultimate reality, Nirvana, Jehovah); and\ninconsistent objects (such as the square circle).\n\n\n\nIn particular, Sylvan devoted significant effort to this last cluster\nof items, underscoring the idea they require the employment of a\nparaconsistent logic. Given that inconsistent items have inconsistent\nproperties, if classical logic is employed then triviality immediately\nfollows. In order to avoid trivialism, the adoption of a\nparaconsistent logic is required.\n\n\nConsider, for instance, inconsistent objects. (\u2026) By virtue of\nwhat they are, they have contradictory properties, thereby\ntrivializing any theory built upon mainstream logic. An authentic\nsistology requires logical reformulation of a more demanding\nparaconsistent type (Sylvan 1991, 839).\n\n\nThe third and last attempt to develop noneism is represented by a\nserious engagement with the notion of a \u201csource\u201d. As he\nhad already discussed, a \u201csource\u201d is what allows us to\nunderstand the charactering properties that an item (cf. 1980, 463;\n1995a). The source of Anna Karenina\u2019s characterizing properties\nis Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina. In sistology, Sylvan aims\nat deepening our understanding of sources by admitting that not all of\nthem are equally reliable. For instance, optical illusions teach us\nthat visual perceptions are not always a trustworthy source for\ncharacterizing the items we see. For this reason, Sylvan suggests\nintroducing two kinds of predicates. The first kind (call them\n\u201cordinary predicates\u201d) tell us how items look;\nthe second kind (call them \u201cnon-ordinary\npredicates\u201d) tell us how items really are.\n\n\nNot all sources are always reliable or otherwise satisfactory; for\nexample, perceptual sources are notoriously unreliable as to how\nthings really are. (\u2026) Thus, [the] division of\n[ordinary and non-ordinary] properties is presumed (1991, 839; italics\nours).\n\n\nSistology, which is only sketched by Sylvan, nevertheless anticipates\nsome of the ideas currently debated among neo-Meinongians, for\nexample, as discussed above, with \u201citems in general\u201d.\nRegardless of the existence or non-existence of these items, sistology\nconcerns their \u201chaving standing\u201d (1991, 839). In so doing,\nSylvan focuses his attention on one of the most under-researched\nnotions of Meinong\u2019s theory of objects, that is, the so-called\ndoctrine of Outsidebeing [Aussersein]. Only recently\nhave neo-Meinongian started to turn their attention to this topic\n(Casati and Priest 2017; Grossman 1974; Jacquette 2015). So too with\nthe very particular kind of object that is \u201cnothingness\u201d\n(cf. Sylvan 1995a). After a long-standing lack of interest in these\ntopics, neo-Meinongians have begun to take them into serious\nconsideration as well (Casati and Fujikawa 2019; Priest 2014a and\n2014b; Jacquette 2013).\n",
