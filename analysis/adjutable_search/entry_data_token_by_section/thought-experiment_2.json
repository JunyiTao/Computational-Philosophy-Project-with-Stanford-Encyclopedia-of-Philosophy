That fact may be obscured by the dominance of scientific\nexamples in the lively discussions about thouht experiments today. The\nPre-Socratics \u201cinvented thought experimentation as a cognitive\nprocedure and practiced it with great dedication and\nversatility\u201d (Rescher 2005, p. 2). \u201cThere is no ancient\nGreek term corresponding to what we nowadays refer to as a thought\nexperiment, and presumably ancient philosophers did not have our\nmodern notion of a thought experiment. But there is no doubt that they\ndid use thought experiments. In fact, they often employed them in ways\nsimilar to those of contemporary philosophers, that is, both for\ndefending their own theories as well as for refuting the theories of\ntheir opponents \u201d (Ierodiakonou 2018, p. 31). (See also Becker\n2018; Diamond 2002, pp. 229\u2013232; Fuhrer 2009; Glas 1999;\nIerodiakonou 2005; Ierodiakonou and Roux (eds.) 2011; Irvine 1991;\nRescher 1991 and 2005, pp. 61\u201372). The situation is similar with\nrespect to medieval natural philosophy, although there are further\nnuances to be considered (see King 1991). According to Edward Grant,\nduring the late Middle Ages \u201cthe imagination became a formidable\ninstrument in natural philosophy and theology in ways that would have\nastonished ancient Greek natural philosophers, especially\nAristotle\u201d (Grant 2007, p. 201). But this doesn\u2019t mean\nthat we have reason to think of Aristotle as an opponent of the\nconduct of thought experiments tout court. On the contrary,\n\u201cAristotle uses thought experiments for argumentative persuasion\nand in places where, due to the obscure nature of the subject matter\nor the counterintuitive nature of the thesis they are meant to\nsupport, insight cannot be readily communicated by appeal to\nobservational facts\u201d (Corcilius 2018, p. 73). With a few\nexceptions that involved problems of motion, \u201cthe\nscholastics\u201d of the medieval period made no meaningful effort to\ntransform their hypothetical conclusions into specific knowledge about\nthe physical world. They did, however, assume that although these\nhypothetical conclusions were naturally impossible, God could produce\nthem supernaturally if he wished. Special attention received also a\nclass of medieval thought experiments that does not rely on\ncounterfactuals but depends on theological assumptions to study\nmatters non-theological, namely those thought experiments involving\nangels, whose existence were affirmed at that time (see Perler 2008).\nAngels are gone by now (see Clark 1992), but not thought experiments.\nWhile most thought experiments involving angels have Christianity as\ntheir context, there is evidence of the practice of thought\nexperiments also in the context of Islam and Judaism (see McGinnis\n2018; Fisch 2019). In fact, the case has been made \u201cthat Ibn\nSina is the first philosopher in the Aristotelian tradition, and thus\nperhaps the first in Western philosophy overall, to try to identify\nthe psychological processes that go into postulating a hypothetical\nscenario. Ibn Sina also exhibits an interest in accounting for why,\nand to what extent, such psychological acts are thought to carry\nweight in our study of nature\u201d (Kukkonen 2014, p. 434).\n\nErnst Mach is commonly credited with introducing the word\n\u201cthought experiment\u201d (Gadankenexperiment) and\nthereby coining a term for philosophical discussion (recently done,\nfor instance, by Krauthausen 2015, p. 15). \u201c This view is\nincorrect, however! [\u2026] it can be substantiated that it was\nused [\u2026] already in 1811\u201d (Witt-Hansen 1976, p. 48; see\nalso Buzzoni 2008, pp. 14\u201315; 61\u201365; K\u00fchne 2005, pp.\n92\u2013224; Moue et al. 2006, p. 63). The conceptual history of\n\u201cthought experiment\u201d goes back at least to the Danish\n\u201cTankeexperiment,\u201d as it was used by Hans-Christian\n\u00d8rsted. We can go back even further and find in the work of the\nGerman philosopher-scientist Georg Lichtenberg (1742\u20131799) a\ntacit theory of \u201cexperiments with thoughts and ideas.\u201d\nThese experiments help to overcome habits of thought that can inhibit\nscientific progress, and make possible an enlightened philosophy (see\nSchildknecht 1990, pp. 21; 123\u2013169; Sch\u00f6ne 1982).\nLichtenberg\u2019s \u201caphoristic experiments\u201d (see Stern\n1963, pp. 112\u2013126) reflect \u201cthat Lichtenberg\u2019s\nscientific preoccupations are the formal and thematic prolegomena to\nhis work as a literary artist\u201d (Stern 1963, p. 126).\nLichtenberg\u2019s reflections on thought experimentation resemble\nthose of Popper and Thomas S. Kuhn, and it is plausible to think of\nhim as one important figure of the very first period in the history of\nphilosophical inquiry into thought experiments (see Fehige and Stuart\n2014).\n\nAccordingly, the modern history of the philosophical investigation\ninto thought experiments can be divided into four stages: in the 18th\nand 19th century the awareness of the importance of thought\nexperiments in philosophy and science emerges. In addition to\nLichtenberg and Hans-Christian \u00d8rsted, special mention should\nbe made of Novalis (see Daiber 2001). The topic reemerges in a more\nsystematic manner at the beginning of the 20th century with little\nrelation to the attempts made at the first stage. The stakeholders of\nthe second stage were Pierre Duhem, Mach, and Alexius Meinong (see\nDuhem 1913, pp. 304\u2013311; Mach, 1883, pp. 48\u201358, 1897 and\n1905; Meinong 1907). A third stage, probably due to the rediscovery of\nthe importance of scientific practice for a proper understanding of\nscience, followed in the first part of the second half of the 20th\ncentury. Again, the contributions of this stage bear little relation\nto the two previous stages. While the third period has seen a number\nof noteworthy contributions (Cole 1983; Dancy 1985; Dennett 1985;\nFodor 1964; Helm and Gilbert 1985; Helm et al. 1985; Krimsky 1973;\nMcMullin 1985; Myers 1986; Poser 1984; Prudovsky 1989; Rehder 1980a,b;\nYourgrau 1962 and 1967), the protagonists of this period were\nAlexandre Koyr\u00e9, Kuhn and Popper. The ongoing philosophical\nexploration of thought experiments began in the 1980s, and marks the\nfourth stage. Arguably, it has been the most prolific one of all four\nstages. With some very important sign-postings in place (Horowitz and\nMassey (eds.) 1991; Sorensen 1992; Wilkes 1988), the ongoing\ndiscussion took off in light of a debate between James Robert Brown\nand John D. Norton (see for a concise statement of each position Brown\n2004 and Norton 2004), which many have found useful to establish a\ncontrast with their own alternative accounts of thought experiments.\nThese views \u201crepresent the extremes of platonic rationalism and\nclassic empiricism, respectively\u201d (Moue et al. 2006, p. 69).\nThey will be described below.\n",
