This presentation, Humboldt emphasized, must be imbued with\naesthetic feeling\u2014which includes the feeling of pleasure, but\nalso feelings of awe and wonder, fear and shock, loneliness, sadness,\nthe sense of constraint and bewilderment.\n\nAs Humboldt saw it, art had a twofold significance. On the one hand,\nby presenting the natural world in an aesthetic way, art has the\npotential to transport the reader or viewer to a place she may not\notherwise visit (DA 1: 61\u201362; EGP: 75). On the other hand, the\naesthetic presentation of nature can reveal the extent to which we are\nourselves part of nature, and can thus shift the way we think about\nand engage with nature. Accordingly, an aesthetic presentation of\nnature offers an alternative mode of knowledge\u2014one that is not\nobjective, distanced, or pure, but embodied and embedded, and, in the\nwords of Caroline Schaumann \u201cdirty\u201d (Schaumann 2011).\n\nHumboldt introduces the idea of \u201ctruth to nature\u201d in his\nexamination of the poem \u201cThe Messenger of Clouds\n[Megaduta]\u201d. Composed by the fourth-century Sanskrit\npoet, Kalidasa, the poem, Humboldt writes, \n\n\ndescribes with admirable truth to nature [Naturwahrheit] the\njoy which, after long drought, the first appearance of a rising cloud\nis hailed as the harbinger of the approaching season of rain.\n(Kosmos 2: 207; CO 2: 51) \n\n\nWhat Humboldt describes as \u201ctruth to nature\u201d is not only a\nportrait of a natural event but also the \u201cjoy\u201d associated\nwith it. To this he adds a reference to the Sanskrit scholar, Theodor\nGoldst\u00fccker. According to Goldst\u00fccker, the poem depicts\n\u201cthe influence of external nature on human feelings\u201d\n(Kosmos 2: 209; CO 2: 53).\n\nNot all writing, Humboldt emphasizes, achieves \u201ctruth to\nnature\u201d. He criticizes Buffon\u2019s works, for instance, on\naccount of their \u201cstyle and rhetorical pomp\u201d, which\ninspire a feeling of the \u201csublime\u201d in the reader that has\nless to do with what is presented, and more to do with Buffon\u2019s\nstyle. By contrast, the works of Rousseau, Bernardin de St. Pierre,\nand Chateaubriand express a \u201cdepth of feeling\u201d through\n\u201cindividualizing true depictions [individualisirend\nwahr]\u201d (Kosmos 2: 220; CO 2: 75\u20136).\n\nIn the works of these authors, the feelings depicted are inspired by\nthe landscape and thus speak of and about the\nlandscape. They are thus neither subjective and interior feelings\n(having only to do with the specific individual experiencing them) nor\narbitrary (random associations, for instance). Rather, they reveal\nsomething about the landscape. Furthermore, as feelings for the\nlandscape, they heighten one\u2019s interest in the landscape. They\ndraw the observer\u2019s attention to the landscape, leading her to\nbecome aware of aspects of the landscape she may have otherwise\nmissed. \n\nHumboldt\u2019s notion of \u201ctruth to nature\u201d involves a\nform of presentation in which thinking and feeling mutually support\none another\u2014where thinking is imbued by and anchored in feeling,\nand feeling inspires thinking. Both feeling and thinking reflect and\nrefer to a natural landscape or a natural process and are connected to\ncareful observations. Yet, as feeling and thinking, they also belong\nto a human subject. Thus, \u201ctruth to nature\u201d occupies a\nspace between inner and outer, subjective and objective. It is truth\nthat emerges in the embodied encounter with a living world\u2014and,\nas Humboldt sees it, it is truth that has cognitive and moral value.\nIt can transform the way we think about nature and the way we relate\nto nature.\n\nWhile Humboldt described a number of works as achieving truth to\nnature, the question remains as to whether Humboldt himself was\nsuccessful in realizing truth to nature in his own works. In other\nwords, do Humboldt\u2019s Naturgem\u00e4lde achieve the\n\u201cdual direction\u201d he set out for them?\n",
