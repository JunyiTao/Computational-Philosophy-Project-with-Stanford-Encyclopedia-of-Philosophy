Only persons reflect on and care about their\nmotivations. According to Frankfurt, this reflective evaluation of our\nmotives usually results in the formation of second-order desires:\ndesires that are directed at first-order desires (which are directed\nat goals and actions). When a person wants to have a certain desire\nand wants to be moved by it, then he or she is said to\n\u201cidentify\u201d with the desire and its motivational efficacy.\nOn this hierarchical account of agency, the role of higher-order\nattitudes is essential to the kind of agency that distinguishes\npersons from other agents. Taylor (1977) took this as a starting point\nfor an account of distinctively human agency, under the\nassumption that the distinction between persons and non-persons is,\nessentially, the distinction between human and non-human agents. It is\nnot entirely clear whether Frankfurt and Taylor meant to provide an\nalternative to the standard theory of agency or an extension\nof it.[8] On one\nreading, they accepted the account of intentional agency provided by\nthe standard theory, and they proposed a hierarchical extension of the\nstandard theory that captures the kind of agency that is distinctive\nof persons or human agents. (For an influential critique of such\nhierarchical accounts see Watson 1975.)\nAccording to Velleman (1992), Frankfurt\u2019s observation that an\nagent may fail to identify with a particular motive points to a\nfundamental flaw in the standard theory. As it seems always possible\nthat an agent \u201cdisowns\u201d the mental attitudes that cause an\naction, those attitudes do not \u201cadd up to the agent\u2019s\nbeing involved\u201d (1992: 463). This shows, according to Velleman,\nthat the standard theory captures, at best, actions that are\ndefective. It fails, in particular, to capture \u201chuman\naction par excellence\u201d, because it fails to account for\nthe agent\u2019s participation. Velleman rejects the appeal to\nirreducible agent-causation (see\nsection 3.1), and he argues that this leaves only one strategy for solving the\nproblem: we must find a mental attitude that the agent cannot disown\nand that is, therefore, fit to play the role of the agent. We must,\nthat is, find a mental attitude that is the agent,\nfunctionally speaking. According to Velleman, the desire to act in\naccordance with reasons is fit to play this role.\nBratman (2000, 2001) agrees with Velleman that the standard theory\ndoes not explain genuine self-governance. On his view, though, an\naccount of \u201cfull-blown agency\u201d, as he calls it, does not\nrequire reference to a mental attitude that the agent cannot disown.\nBuilding on his work on temporally extended planning agency (Bratman\n1987), he argues that an agent\u2019s \u201cself-governing\npolicies\u201d have the \u201cauthority to speak for the\nagent\u201d, because they help to establish and support the\nagent\u2019s identity across time, and because they specify which\ndesires are to be treated as providing justifying reasons in practical\ndeliberation. According to Bratman, these self-governing policies\nexplain what it is for an agent \u201cto take a stand in favor of or\nagainst certain motivations, a stand that can itself be subject to\nreexamination and revision\u201d (2000: 50\u201351). (For a critical\ndiscussion of Bratman\u2019s account see Hornsby 2004 and Franklin 2017.)\nIn defense of the standard theory, Mele (2003: Ch. 10) has argued\nthat the search for a mental attitude that plays the role of the agent\nis misguided and that Velleman\u2019s critique of the view is off\ntarget. As Mele points out, it seems clear that a desire cannot\npossibly be the agent, because agents deliberate, decide, and act.\nDesires do none of these things. He suggests that any talk of a mental\nattitude as playing the role of the agent can at best be metaphorical.\nFurther, there is no obvious reason why an agent\u2019s failure to\nidentify with a motive should be diagnosed in terms of the\nagent\u2019s failure to participate. It seems more plausible to\nsuggest that the agent does participate in such cases, but in a\ndefective manner. Once defective participation is distinguished from a\nfailure to participate, it is easy to avoid Velleman\u2019s\nconclusion that the standard theory \u201cleaves out the\nagent\u201d. Moreover, one can then separate the question of whether\nthe standard theory accounts for the agent\u2019s participation from\nthe question of whether it captures human action par\nexcellence. According to Mele, the human agent is simply a human\nbeing who acts. On this view, the agent does play some role in all\ninstances of agency, no matter how deficient. The standard theory\nprovides, first and foremost, an account of what it is for an agent to\nperform intentional actions. It does not claim that the capacity to\nperform intentional actions is the capacity that separates human from\nnon-human agency, and it does not claim to give an account of more\nrefined or excellent kinds of human agency, such as self-controlled,\nautonomous, wholehearted, or free agency. It is an interesting and\nimportant task to investigate whether or not the standard theory can\nbe extended so as to account for the more refined or excellent kinds\nof human agency (Mele 1995; Bratman 2007, for instance). But to reject\nthe view because it fails to do so is to misconstrue its aim and scope\n(see also\nsection 3.3).\n\n",
