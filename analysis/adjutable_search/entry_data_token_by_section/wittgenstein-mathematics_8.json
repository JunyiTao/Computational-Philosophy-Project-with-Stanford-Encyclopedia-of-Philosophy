    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein on Mathematics: Some Preliminaries\n3. The Later Wittgenstein on Mathematics: Some Preliminaries\n\nThe first and most important thing to note about Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlater Philosophy of Mathematics is that RFM, first published\nin 1956, consists of selections taken from a number of\nmanuscripts (1937\u20131944), most of one large typescript (1938),\nand three short typescripts (1938), each of which constitutes an\nAppendix to (RFM I). For this reason and because some\nmanuscripts containing much material on mathematics (e.g., MS 123)\nwere not used at all for\nRFM, philosophers have not been able to read\nWittgenstein\u2019s later remarks on mathematics as they were written\nin the manscripts used for RFM and they have not had access\n(until the 2000\u20132001 release of the Nachlass on CD-ROM)\nto much of Wittgenstein\u2019s later work on mathematics. It must be\nemphasized, therefore, that this Encyclopedia article is\nbeing written during a transitional period. Until philosophers have\nused the Nachlass to build a comprehensive picture of\nWittgenstein\u2019s complete and evolving Philosophy of Mathematics,\nwe will not be able to say definitively which views the later\nWittgenstein retained, which he changed, and which he dropped. In the\ninterim, this article will outline Wittgenstein\u2019s later\nPhilosophy of Mathematics, drawing primarily on RFM, to a\nmuch lesser extent LFM (1939 Cambridge lectures), and, where\npossible, previously unpublished material in Wittgenstein\u2019s\nNachlass.\n\nIt should also be noted at the outset that commentators disagree about\nthe continuity of Wittgenstein\u2019s middle and later Philosophies\nof Mathematics. Some argue that the later views are significantly\ndifferent from the intermediate views (Frascolla 1994; Gerrard 1991:\n127, 131\u201332; Floyd 2005: 105\u2013106), while others argue\nthat, for the most part, Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophy of\nMathematics evolves from the middle to the later period without\nsignificant changes or renunciations (Wrigley 1993; Marion 1998). The remainder of this article adopts the\nsecond interpretation, explicating Wittgenstein\u2019s later\nPhilosophy of Mathematics as largely continuous with his intermediate\nviews, except for the important introduction of an extra-mathematical\napplication criterion.\n",
