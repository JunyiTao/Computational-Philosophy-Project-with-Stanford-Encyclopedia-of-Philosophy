    "main_text": "The State\n11. War and International Relations\n\nThe state has an \u201cimmediate actuality\u201d in terms of its\ninternal organization as discussed above, but it further determines\nitself internationally in relation to other states (PR\n\u00a7259). This part of the PR is the least worked out and\ndetailed.\n\nHegel accepts a broadly Westphalian and realist view of\ninternational relations whereby the primary actors are states each\nprioritizing the pursuit of their individual welfare (PR\n\u00a7336, Smith 1983). States interact with each other like\nindividuals in an anarchic global space. Without any governing global\nauthority, states can come into conflict with each other. He says\n\u201cwars must be regarded as necessary because independent peoples\nexist alongside one another\u201d (LNR \u00a7160 Remark).\nThis is not a justification or glorification of war, but a recognition\nthat states are in a state of nature where war is occasionally\nunavoidable (see LNR \u00a7162 Remark). States should aim to\nenable other states \u201cto live at peace with it\u201d and\n\u201cwar is that of something which ought to come to an end\u201d\n(PR \u00a7338).\n\nBut it is also the case that Hegel saw war as testing the relative\nhealth of states where those most rationally organized should triumph\nover less well ethically structured states. Combined with his rejection\nof Kant\u2019s proposals for perpetual peace, it has led some to\nquestion whether or not war plays a positive, and troubling, role in\nhis philosophy (Avineri 1961, Black 1973, Shelton 2000, Walt 1989).\nHegel also comments that \u201cmodern wars are accordingly waged in a\nhumane manner, and all persons do not confront each other in\nhatred\u201d which can give the impression that modern wars are of an\nimproved ethical quality than past wars \u2013 when the opposite\nappears true (PR \u00a7338 Addition).\n\nThe only judge of relative rights and wrongs in the international\nsphere is \u201cworld history as the world\u2019s court of\njudgement\u201d (PR \u00a7340). The PR then\ntransitions to the start of an account of the philosophy of history in\nthe next part of his system, which presupposes all parts preceding it\nnot least the PR itself.\n",
