    "main_text": "Ontology || Imagination\n3.3 Imagination\n\nImagination (khay\u00e2l), as Corbin has shown, plays a\nmajor role in Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s writings. In the\nOpenings, for example, he says about it, \u201cAfter the\nknowledge of the divine names and of self-disclosure and its\nall-pervadingness, no pillar of knowledge is more complete\u201d (Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee, al-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition,\n2:309.17). He frequently criticizes philosophers and theologians for\ntheir failure to acknowledge its cognitive significance. In his view,\n\u2018aql or reason, a word that derives from the same root\nas \u2018iq\u00e2l, fetter, can only delimit, define, and\nanalyze. It perceives difference and distinction, and quickly grasps\nthe divine transcendence and incomparability. In contrast, properly\ndisciplined imagination has the capacity to perceive God\u2019s\nself-disclosure in all Three Books. The symbolic and mythic language\nof scripture, like the constantly shifting and never-repeated\nself-disclosures that are cosmos and soul, cannot be interpreted away\nwith reason\u2019s strictures. What Corbin calls \u201ccreative\nimagination\u201d (a term that does not have an exact equivalent in\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s vocabulary) must complement rational\nperception.\n\nIn Koranic terms, the locus of awareness and consciousness is the\nheart (qalb), a word that has the verbal sense of fluctuation\nand transmutation (taqallub). According to Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee, the heart has two eyes, reason and imagination,\nand the dominance of either distorts perception and awareness. The\nrational path of philosophers and theologians needs to be complemented\nby the mystical intuition of the Sufis, the \u201cunveiling\u201d\n(kashf) that allows for imaginal\u2014not\n\u201cimaginary\u201d\u2014vision. The heart, which in itself is\nunitary consciousness, must become attuned to its own fluctuation, at\none beat seeing God\u2019s incomparability with the eye of reason, at\nthe next seeing his similarity with the eye of imagination. Its two\nvisions are prefigured in the two primary names of the Scripture,\nal-qur\u2019\u00e2n, \u201cthat which brings\ntogether\u201d, and al-furq\u00e2n, \u201cthat which\ndifferentiates\u201d. These two demarcate the contours of ontology\nand epistemology. The first alludes to the unifying oneness of Being\n(perceived by imagination), and the second to the differentiating\nmanyness of knowledge and discernment (perceived by reason). The Real,\nas Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee often says, is the One/the Many\n(al-w\u00e2hid al-kath\u00eer), that is, One in Essence and\nmany in names, the names being the principles of all multiplicity,\nlimitation, and definition. In effect, with the eye of imagination,\nthe heart sees Being present in all things, and with the eye of reason\nit discerns its transcendence and the diversity of the divine\nfaces.\n\nHe who stops with the Koran inasmuch as it is a\nqur\u2019\u00e2n has but a single eye that unifies and\nbrings together. For those who stop with it inasmuch as it is a\ntotality of things brought together, however, it is a\nfurq\u00e2n\u2026. When I tasted the latter\u2026, I\nsaid, \u201cThis is lawful, that is unlawful, and this is\nindifferent. The schools have become various and the religions\ndiverse. The levels have been distinguished, the divine names and the\nengendered traces have become manifest, and the names and the gods\nhave become many in the world\u201d. (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee,\nal-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition, 3:94.16)\n\n\nWhen Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee talks about imagination as one of the\nheart\u2019s two eyes, he is using the language that philosophers\nestablished in speaking of the soul\u2019s faculties. But he is more\nconcerned with imagination\u2019s ontological status, about which the\nearly philosophers had little to say. Here his use of\nkhay\u00e2l accords with its everyday meaning, which is\ncloser to image than imagination. It was employed to designate mirror\nimages, shadows, scarecrows, and everything that appears in dreams and\nvisions; in this sense it is synonymous with the term\nmith\u00e2l, which was often preferred by later authors. Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee stresses that an image brings together two sides\nand unites them as one; it is both the same as and different from the\ntwo. A mirror image is both the mirror and the object that it\nreflects, or, it is neither the mirror nor the object. A dream is both\nthe soul and what is seen, or, it is neither the soul nor what is\nseen. By nature images are/are not. In the eye of reason, a notion is\neither true or false. Imagination perceives notions as images and\nrecognizes that they are simultaneously true and false, or neither\ntrue nor false. The implications for ontology become clear when we\nlook at the three \u201cworlds of imagination\u201d.\n\nIn the broadest sense of the term, imagination/image designates\neverything other than God, the entire cosmos inasmuch as it is\ncontingent and evanescent. This is what Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee calls\n\u201cNondelimited Imagination\u201d (al-khay\u00e2l\nal-mutlaq). Each of the infinite words articulated in the\nAll-Merciful Breath discloses Being in a limited form. Everything\nwithout exception is both God\u2019s face (wajh), revealing\ncertain divine names, and God\u2019s veil (hij\u00e2b),\nconcealing other names. Inasmuch as a thing exists, it can be nothing\nbut that which is, the Real Being; inasmuch as it does not exist, it\nmust be other than the Real. Each thing, in Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s most succinct expression, is He/not He\n(huwa/l\u00e2 huwa)\u2014Real/unreal, Being/nonexistence,\nFace/veil. \u201cIn reality, the \u2018other\u2019 is affirmed/not\naffirmed, He/not He\u201d (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee,\nal-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition, 2:501.4).\n\nIn a narrower sense of the word, imagination denotes what Corbin calls\nthe mundus imaginalis (\u2018\u00e2lam\nal-khay\u00e2l). Like most traditions, Islam conceives of the\ncosmos as a hierarchy of worlds, usually two or three; the Koran\ncontrasts the Unseen (ghayb) with the Visible\n(shah\u00e2da), and these are typically called the world of\nspirits and the world of bodies, or, in philosophical terms, the\nintelligible and the sensible realms. The Koran also speaks of\n\u201cheaven, earth, and everything in between\u201d, and one of Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s contributions was to bring out the full\nimplications of the in-between realm, which in one respect is unseen,\nspiritual, and intelligible, and in another respect visible,\ncorporeal, and sensible. This is precisely the mundus\nimaginalis, where spiritual beings are corporealized, as when\nGabriel appeared in human form to the Virgin Mary; and where corporeal\nbeings are spiritualized, as when bodily pleasure or pain is\nexperienced in the posthumous realms. The mundus imaginalis\nis a real, external realm in the Cosmic Book, more real than the\nvisible, sensible, physical realm, but less real than the invisible,\nintelligible, spiritual realm. Only its actual existence can account\nfor angelic and demonic apparitions, bodily resurrection, visionary\nexperience, and other nonphysical yet sensory phenomena that\nphilosophers typically explain away. Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s\nforegrounding of the in-between realm was one of several factors that\nprevented Islamic philosophy from falling into the trap of a mind/body\ndichotomy or a dualistic worldview.\n\nThe third world of imagination belongs to the microcosmic human book,\nin which it is identical with the soul or self (nafs), which\nis the meeting place of spirit (r\u00fbh) and body\n(jism). Human experience is always imaginal or soulish\n(nafs\u00e2n\u00ee), which is to say that it is\nsimultaneously spiritual and bodily. Human becoming wavers between\nspirit and body, light and darkness, wakefulness and sleep, knowledge\nand ignorance, virtue and vice. Only because the soul dwells in an\nin-between realm can it choose to strive for transformation and\nrealization. Only as an imaginal reality can it travel\n\u201cup\u201d toward the luminosity of the spirit or\n\u201cdown\u201d toward the darkness of matter.\n",
