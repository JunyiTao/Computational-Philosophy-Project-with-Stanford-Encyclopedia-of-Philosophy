    "main_text": "Reconciling Morality and Prudential Rationality || Limitations of the Reconciliation Project\n3.4 Limitations of the Reconciliation Project\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, game theory has been incorporated into each of\nthe main approaches to the Reconciliation Project. However,\ngame-theoretic analysis can also show why each of these strategies may\nfall short of fully reconciling morality with prudential rationality.\nFor instance, for the inseparable goods strategy to be effective,\nagents like the Foole must be persuaded that the goods intrinsic to\njust conduct are either of such great value, or that the costs\nassociated with injustice are so substantial, that one would be\nfoolish to risk acting unjustly. But it\u2019s far from obvious that\nthis is always (or even usually) true.\n\nSimilarly, although one can present social sanctions arguments for\nacting morally to agents like the Foole, these arguments depend on\nmembers of society being willing to sanction bad behavior and capable\nof doing so effectively, and this is by no means guaranteed. In fact\nthis is a difficulty that the functional analysis of norms clearly\nanticipates. For example, in addition to highlighting the importance\nof conditional strategies and the willingness to sanction bad behavior\nAxelrod (1984) also emphasized the importance of employing strategies\nthat are easy for others to interpret. While Bicchieri (2006)\nemphasizes the problems that are prone to arise in circumstances where\nit\u2019s not clear which norm applies, and Boyd & Richerson\n(2005) have drawn attention to the costs associated with policing\nnorms. Accordingly, the Foole can object that, even if all the members\nof her community were committed to following something like the Humean\nstrategy to the best of their abilities, it\u2019s not obvious that\nthey would be able to reliably follow it. In fact, the Humean strategy\nrests upon some rather demanding epistemic assumptions, including\nespecially that community members can reliably distinguish between\nguilty and innocent partners, something that may become increasingly\nunlikely as the size of a community increases.\n\nFurthermore, as the folk theorem implies, although it\u2019s\ncertainly possible that all of the members of a community could follow\na strategy like \\(h^{*}\\) in a situation like the Foole finds herself\nin, there are likely to be many other equilibria as well. Moreover,\nsome of these equilibria may be hard to distinguish from one another,\nespecially if agents like the Foole are sufficiently rare, and in some\nof these equilibria it may be in the Foole\u2019s interest to\noffensively violate covenants. The effectiveness of the social\nsanctions strategy, then, is plainly dependent upon the ability of\ncommunity members to build and maintain reliable reputations, and to\nrely on this information in their interactions with one another.\n\nFinally, the revisionary principles at the heart of the reformed\ndecision theory strategy proposed by Gauthier and McClennen rest upon\nan agent\u2019s ability to adopt a disposition to conditionally\nfollow certain pro-social strategies regardless of whether doing so is\nin an agent\u2019s best interest at the moment of action. Critics of\nthis strategy, however, have questioned what it means to bind oneself\nto her past commitments in this way, and they have also identified\nnumerous cases where doing so would be in neither an agent\u2019s\nshort nor long-run interest. Furthermore, while Gauthier\u2019s\nanalysis of the benefits of constrained maximization is analogous in\nsome ways to Bicchieri\u2019s analysis of how social norms can\ntransform mixed-motive social dilemmas into coordination games, the\nlatter depend on sanctions (or expectations of sanctions) in a way\nthat the former do not. As a result, even if agents could credibly\nadopt dispositions to constrain their future behavior, for a rule like\nconstrained maximization to do its practical work, agents must be able\nto recognize who has and has not adopted the dispositions in\nquestion. However, some critics doubt that we can reliably recognize\nwho adopts such dispositions. Of course, proponents of the reformed\ndecision theory strategy are well aware of these criticisms and have\ndeveloped careful responses in their works. So far, though, its\ncritics have not been assuaged and the reformed decision theory\nstrategy has been the least influential of the approaches described\nhere.\n",
