A conception of the common good is not just a\ncriterion for correct action, such that citizens would satisfy the\nconception so long as they performed the correct action, regardless of\ntheir subjective reasons for doing so. The point of a conception of\nthe common good is to define a pattern of practical reasoning, a way\nof thinking and acting that constitutes the appropriate form of mutual\nconcern among members. In order to satisfy the conception, the\nactivities of the members of the community must be organized, at some\nlevel, by thought processes that embody the relevant\n pattern.[10]\n\n",
