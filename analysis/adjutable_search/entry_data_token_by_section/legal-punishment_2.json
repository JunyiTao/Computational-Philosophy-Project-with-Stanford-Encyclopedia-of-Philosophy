Consequentialist Accounts\n\nMany people, including those who do not take a consequentialist view\nof other matters, think that any adequate justification of punishment\nmust be basically consequentialist. For we have here a practice that\ninflicts, indeed seeks to inflict, significant hardship or burdens:\nhow else could we hope to justify it than by showing that it brings\nconsequential benefits sufficiently large to outweigh, and thus to\njustify, those burdens? We need not be Benthamite utilitarians to be\nmoved by Bentham\u2019s famous remark that \u201call punishment in\nitself is evil. ... [I]f it ought at all to be admitted, it ought only\nto be admitted in as far as it promises to exclude some greater\nevil\u201d (Bentham 1789: ch. XIII.2). However, when we try to flesh\nout this simple consequentialist thought into something closer to a\nfull normative account of punishment, problems begin to appear.\n\nA consequentialist must justify punishment (if she is to justify it at\nall) as a cost-effective means to certain independently identifiable\ngoods (for two simple examples of such theories, see Wilson 1983;\nWalker 1991). Whatever account she gives of the final good or goods at\nwhich all action ultimately aims, the most plausible immediate good\nthat a system of punishment can bring is the reduction of crime. A\nrational consequentialist system of law will define as criminal only\nconduct that is in some way harmful; in reducing crime we will thus be\nreducing the harms that crime causes. It is commonly suggested that\npunishment can help to reduce crime by deterring, incapacitating, or\nreforming potential offenders (though for an argument that\nincapacitation is not a genuinely punitive aim, see Hoskins 2016:\n260). (There are of course other goods that a system of punishment can\nbring. It can reassure those who fear crime that the state is taking\nsteps to protect them\u2014though this is a good that, in a\nwell-informed society, will be achieved only insofar as the more\nimmediate preventive goods are achieved. It can also bring\nsatisfaction to those who want to see wrongdoers suffer \u2014 though\nto show that to be a genuine good, rather than merely a means of\naverting vigilantism and private revenge, we would need to show that\nit involves something more than mere vengeance, which would be to make\nsense of some version of retributivism.)\n\nIn consequentialist terms, punishment will be justified if it is an\neffective means of achieiving its aim, if its benefits outweigh its\ncosts, and if there is no less burdensome means of achieving the same\naim. It is a contingent question whether punishment can satisfy these\nconditions, and some objections to punishment rest on the empirical\nclaim that it cannot \u2014 that there are more effective and less\nburdensome methods of crime reduction (see Wootton 1963; Menninger\n1968; Golash 2005: chs. 2 and 8; Boonin 2008: 53, 264-67). Our focus\nhere, however, will be on the moral objections to consequentialist\naccounts of punishment \u2014 objections, basically, that\ncrime-reductive efficiency does not suffice to justify a system of\npunishment.\n\nThe most familiar line of objection to consequentialist penal theories\ncontends that consequentialists would be committed to regarding\nmanifestly unjust punishments (the punishment of those known to be\ninnocent, for instance, or excessively harsh punishment of the guilty)\nto be in principle justified if they would efficiently serve the aim\nof crime reduction: but such punishments would be wrong, because they\nwould be unjust (see e.g., McCloskey 1957: 468-69; Hart 1968, chs.\n1\u20132; Ten 1987; Primoratz 1999, chs. 2\u20133; Boonin 2008: ch.\n2).\n\nThere are some equally familiar consequentialist responses to this\nobjection. One is to argue that such \u2018unjust\u2019punishments\nwould be justified if they would really produce the best\nconsequences (see e.g., Smart 1973: 69\u201372; Bagaric and\nAmarasekara 2000) \u2014 to which the critic will reply that we\ncannot thus put aside the moral significance of injustice. Another is\nto argue that in the real world it is extremely unlikely that such\npunishments would ever be for the best, and even less likely that the\nagents involved could be trusted reliably to pick out those rare cases\nin which they would be: thus we, and especially our penal officials,\nwill do best if we think and act as if such punishments are\nintrinsically wrong and unjustifiable (see e.g., Rawls 1955; Hare\n1981, chs. 3, 9.7) \u2014 to which the critic will respond that this\nstill makes the wrongness of punishing a known innocent contingent on\nits effects, and fails to recognise the intrinsic wrong that such\npunishment does (see e.g., Duff 1986: 151\u201364; Primoratz 1999,\nchs. 3.3, 6.5). Another response is to argue that a richer or subtler\naccount of the ends that the criminal law should serve will generate\nsuitable protection against unjust punishments (see Braithwaite and\nPettit 1990, especially 71\u201376, on \u2018dominion\u2019 as the\nend of criminal law); but the objection remains that any purely\nconsequentialist account will make the protection of the innocent\nagainst injustice contingent on its instrumental contribution to the\nsystem\u2019s aims (on Braithwaite and Pettit, see von Hirsch and\nAshworth 1992; Duff 1996: 20\u201325; Pettit 1997).\n\nAnother objection to consequentialist accounts focuses not on\npotential wrongs done to the innocent but rather on the wrong\nallegedly done to the guilty. Consequentialist punishment, on this\nobjection, fails to respect the person punished as an autonomous moral\nagent. In Kantian terms, such punishment treats those punished as mere\nmeans to achieving some social good, rather than respecting them as\nends in themselves (Kant 1797: 473; Murphy 1973). The Kantian\nprohibition on treating each other \u2018merely as means\u2019 is\nadmittedly unclear in its implications (for a useful discussion of how\nwe should understand \u2018the means principle\u2019, see Tadros\n2011: ch. 6). One might argue that if punishment is reserved for those\nwho voluntarily break the law, it does not treat them merely\nas means. Indeed, Kant himself suggested that as long as we\nreserve punishment only for those found guilty of crimes, then it is\npermissible to punish with an eye toward potential benefits (Kant\n1797: 473). As we have seen, though, insofar as such an approach\nrelies on endorsing prohibitions on punishment of the innocent or\ndisproportionate punishment of the guilty, the challenge remains that\nsuch constraints appear to be merely contingent if grounded in\nconsequentialist considerations. Conversely, if the constraints are\nmore than merely contingent, it appears that they will be based on\nsome deontological considerations, in which case the overall theory\nwill no longer be purely consequentialist, but rather a mixed theory\n(see s. 6).\n\nA more recent objection (Duff 2011: 75\u201379) charges that\nconsequentialist systems of punishment are inappropriately\nexclusionary insofar as they treat offenders as dangerous\n\u2018outsiders\u2019 who must be threatened, incapacitated, or\nreformed to ensure the safety of the law-abiding members of society.\nThe criminal law, and the institution of punishment, in a liberal\nsociety should treat offenders as (still) members of the polity who\ndespite having violated its values could, and should, nonetheless\n(re)commit to these values. A possible response is that a penal system\naimed at crime reduction through deterrence need not be exclusionary,\nas it treats all community members equally, namely as potential\noffenders (Hoskins 2011a: 379\u201381). Also, insofar as such a\nsystem \u2018promotes social cooperation under stable public\ninstitutions\u2019, it thus helps to protect the freedom of everyone\n(Chiao 2018: 36).\n",
