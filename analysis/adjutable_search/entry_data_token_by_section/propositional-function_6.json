    "main_text": "Propositional Functions in Ramified Type Theory\n7. Propositional Functions in Ramified Type Theory\nAfter the Principles, however, Russell comes to believe\nthat the simple theory of types is insufficient. The reason for\nit has to do with the\n  liar paradox. Suppose that \u2018L\u2019 is a name\nfor the proposition:\n\nL is false.\nThis statement is false if and only if it is true.\nThe problem here has something to do with self-reference, but it\ncannot be avoided by the simple theory of types alone. For simple\ntypes only give us a hierarchy of types of propositional functions.\nIn simple type theory, all propositions have the same type. \nThe idea behind ramified type theory is to introduce a\nhierarchy of propositions as well. On this view, propositions and\npropositional functions have an\norder. If a propositional function is applied to a\nproposition of a particular order, then it yields a proposition of a\nhigher order. And every function must have a higher order than its\narguments. Thus, we avoid the liar paradox by banning a proposition\nfrom occurring within itself. If a proposition p occurs\nwithin another proposition, as the argument of a function such as\nx is false, then the resulting proposition is of a higher\norder than p.\nUnfortunately, Russell never gives a precise formulation of\nramified type theory. Perhaps the best formulation is due to Alonzo\nChurch (1976).[1]\nAlmost at the same time as he adopts the ramified theory of types,\nRussell abandons propositions. From about 1908 until 1918, although\nRussell retains the idea that there are true propositions, he denies\nthat there are false ones. When we think about something that is\nfalse, say, Zermela is a cat, we are not thinking about a\nfalse proposition, but rather the objects of our thought are just\nZermela and the property of being a cat. It might seem odd to have a\nhierarchy especially designed to stratify the propositions and then\nclaim that there are no propositions. Some interpreters, however,\nhave claimed that Russell's denial of the existence of propositions\nshould not be taken seriously and that there are very good reasons to\nread Principia as being largely a theory of propositions\n(see Church 1984).\nOne reason to take the ramified theory of types seriously (even\nwithout accepting propositions) is that it can be usefully\nincorporated into a substitutional theory of quantification. On the\nsubstitutional interpretation of the quantifiers, a universally\nquantified formula such as (\u2200x)Fx is true if\nand only if all of its instances\nFa1, Fa2, Fa3,\u2026\nare true. Similarly, (\u2200x)Fa is true if and\nonly if at least one of its instances is true.\n\nConsider a substitutional interpretation of quantifiers with\nvariables ranging over predicates, as in the formula,\n(\u2200P)Pa. This formula is true if and only if all\nof its instances are true. On a simple theory of types, the type of\nthe variable\nP is <i>, since its arguments are all\nindividuals (or singular terms). But the simple type of the function,\n(\u2200P)Px is also <i>. So an instance of\n(\u2200P)Pa is (\u2200P)Pa\nitself. A substitutional interpretation of the quantifiers requires\nthat instances be simpler than the formulas of which they are\ninstances. In this case, all we find out is that a particular formula\nis true only if it is true. This is uninformative and it seems\nviciously circular.\nTo block this sort of circularity, we can turn to the ramified\ntheory of types. On the ramified theory, the propositional function\n(\u2200P)Px is of order 2, because of the presence\nof the quantifier binding a variable of order 1. In this way, the\nramified theory forces formulas to be simpler (at least in terms of\norder) than the formulas of which they are instances (see Hazen and\nDavoren 2000).\n",
