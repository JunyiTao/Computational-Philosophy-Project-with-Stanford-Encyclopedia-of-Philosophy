    "main_text": "Many-Valued Logic || Indeterminism and the Third Value\n5.2 Indeterminism and the Third Value\n\nThis final remark reveals the motivation of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s\ndrive to replace the old bivalent logic with the new trivalent one. It\nwas in order to defend indeterminism and freedom. In fact the idea had\ncome to fruition some three years earlier. Having been appointed to an\nadministrative position in the Ministry of Education in 1918, and\nbeing about to leave academic life for an indefinite period,\n\u0141ukasiewicz delivered a \u201cfarewell lecture\u201d to the\nUniversity of Warsaw on 17 March, in which he announced dramatically,\n\u201cI have declared a spiritual war upon all coercion that\nrestricts man\u2019s free creative activity.\u201d The logical form\nof this coercion, in \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s view, was Aristotelian\nlogic, which restricted propositions to true or false. His own weapon\nin this war was three-valued logic. Recalling his 1910 monograph, he\nnotes that:\n\nEven then I strove to construct non-Aristotelian logic, but in vain.\nNow I believe I have succeeded in this. My path was indicated to me by\nantinomies, which prove that there is a gap in Aristotle\u2019s\nlogic. Filling that gap led me to a transformation of the traditional\nprinciples of logic. Examination of that issue was the subject-matter\nof my last lectures. I have proved that in addition to true and false\npropositions there are possible propositions, to which\nobjective possibility corresponds as a third in addition to being and\nnon-being. This gave rise to a system of three-valued logic, which I\nworked out in detail last summer. That system is as coherent and\nself-consistent as Aristotle\u2019s logic, and is much richer in laws\nand formulae. That new logic, by introducing the concept of objective\npossibility, destroys the former concept of science, based on\nnecessity. Possible phenomena have no causes, although they themselves\ncan be the beginning of a causal sequence. An act of a creative\nindividual can be free and at the same time affect the course of the\nworld. (SW, 86)\n\n\nBecause \u0141ukasiewicz was involved in government until the end of\n1919, it took until 1920 for his discoveries of 1917 to be revealed to\na wider academic public. \u0141ukasiewicz returned to the subject of\ndeterminism for his inaugural lecture as Rector of the University of\nWarsaw on 16 October 1922. That lecture, delivered without notes but\nlater written down, was reworked, though not in essentials, up until\n1946. It was published only posthumously in 1961 as \u201cOn\nDeterminism\u201d. Distinguishing logical from causal determinism,\n\u0141ukasiewicz claims that if a prediction of a future contingent\nevent such as an action is true at the time the prediction is made,\nthe event must occur, so the only way to rescue the agent\u2019s\nfreedom of action is to deny that the prediction is true, and assign\nit instead the third truth-value of possibility.\n\nHere is not the place to go into the problems with\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s argumentation. Suffice it to say that the\nprinciple EpLp need not be accepted by determinists, and that\nother logicians who have considered adding a third value to logic,\nsuch as (unbeknown to \u0141ukasiewicz) William of Ockham, concluded\nthat there was no reason to reject bivalence while upholding freedom.\nThis is without even considering compatibilist views.\n",
