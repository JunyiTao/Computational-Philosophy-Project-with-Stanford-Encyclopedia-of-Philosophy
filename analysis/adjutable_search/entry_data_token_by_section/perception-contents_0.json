    "main_text": "What are Perceptual Experiences?\n1. What are Perceptual Experiences?\n\nThis entry will focus exclusively on the contents of perceptual\nexperiences. It is definitional of experience, as the term is\nused here, that they have some phenomenal character, or more briefly,\nsome phenomenology. The phenomenology of an experience is what it is\nlike for the subject to have it. At any given waking moment, one\nnormally has experiences in some (perhaps all) of the five sense\nmodalities, along with proprioceptive experience of some sort. Like\noccurrent emotions and background moods, these contribute to\none\u2019s overall experience. Each of five sense modalities\nseems to be accompanied by a distinctive kind of phenomenology.\nSometimes the boundaries between them can be hard to draw, for example\nbetween olfactory and gustatory phenomenology, kinesthetic experience\nand haptic-tactile experience (that is, tactile experiences involving\nmovement rather than just pressure sensation), and perhaps, in some\ncases, between the latter two and visual experience (on the last point\nsee Press et al. 2004, Kennett et al. 2001,\nFotopoulou et al. 2009; on distinguishing the senses, see\nStokes, Matthen and Briggs 2014, Wilson and Macpherson 2018). Despite\nthese difficulties, some rough distinctions can be drawn: the\ndifference between seeing red and seeing blue is not a difference in\nhow things sound, or in how one\u2019s body feels.\n\nIn what follows, \u201cexperiences\u201d will be restricted to\nexperiences in any of the five modalities or kinesthetic experience or\nsome combination. In the analytic tradition, most of the questions\ndiscussed in this entry have been addressed with regard to visual\nexperience and pain. In contrast, the phenomenological tradition\nexplored similar questions with respect to other modalities. For\ninstance, Husserl\u2019s exploration of auditory experience of\nhearing a melody is central to his discussion of the experience of\ntime (see the entries on\n phenomenology,\n auditory perception, and the\n perception of time).\n In principle, however, the questions addressed here could be raised\nwith respect to any kind of experience.\n",
