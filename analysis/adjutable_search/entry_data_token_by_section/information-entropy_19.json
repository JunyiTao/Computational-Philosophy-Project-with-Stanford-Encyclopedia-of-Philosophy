    "main_text": "The Role of Quantum Theory\n6. Discussion\n\n\nThroughout the literature, there are widely different motivations\nand standards of proof accepted, so that at times it can be hard to see\nany coherent body of work. Maxwell's original intention was to\ndemonstrate that the second law had only limited validity, and that\nviolations were possible. Although he originally described the demon as a\nliving being, he later reduced its role to that of being a valve.\nSmoluchowski sought to tame the demon, by formulating a modified second\nlaw that it did not violate. His exorcism applied only to mechanical\ndevices and he left open the question of whether intelligent\nintervention could reverse the second law. As the literature developed,\nboth the scope of the exorcism and the nature of the demon changed. The\nconcept of intelligence became reduced to that of information\nprocessing performed by a mechanical device. Rather than investigate\nhow a tame demon might be constrained by physical laws the aim became\nto exclude demons altogether. Much of the resulting literature proceeds\non a case-by-case basis, where individual examples of demons are argued\nto fail and it is simply extrapolated that all demons will fail for\nsimilar reasons.\n\n\nSzilard's original intention was to analyse whether intelligence\ncould be used to defeat the second law. His argument did not analyse\nwhat was meant by intelligence. He argued that any being, however\nintelligent, would still have to perform measurements. If these\nmeasurements came with a sufficient entropic cost, the second law would\nbe safe without needing to consider further the constitution of an\nintelligent being. This clearly does not require intelligence to be\nreduced to performing measurements and processing the results of such\nmeasurements.\n\n\nUnder the analysis of von Neumann, Brillouin and Gabor, a more\ngeneral conception developed of information processing having a\nfundamental entropic cost. The possession of information could indeed\nbe regarded as reducing entropy and therefore capable of producing\nthermodynamic work. However, as the acquisition of information, through\nmeasurement, was still believed to require a dissipation of heat, there\nwas no threat to a generalised form of the second law. No explicit\nconsideration needed to be made regarding exactly what kind of being\nthe possessor of information had to be.\n\n\nLandauer's analysis led to the argument that measurement did not\nreduce the degrees of freedom needed to represent the combined system\nof object and measuring device, so did not lead to the necessity of\nheat generation. The models of measurement proposed by Szilard, Gabor\nand Brillouin were insufficiently general. Landauer's early papers did\nnot explicitly consider the Szilard engine and the problem of Maxwell's\ndemon, so they did not address what implications this had for the\nconsistency of statistical mechanics. It appears that Landauer believed\nthat logically reversible computation could not be achieved without\naccumulating a large amount of irrelevant information. That\naccumulation would ultimately require erasure, so that the cost of a\nlogically irreversible computation could not be avoided. It took\nBennett to demonstrate that this cost could be avoided in logically\nreversible computation.\n\n\nNevertheless Bennett also argued that the Szilard engine was a process\nwhere the logically irreversible erasure step could not be avoided to\ncomplete the cycle. The information acquired during the\nnon-dissipative measurement had to be stored in the state of the\ndemon's memory. While this information allowed the demon to extract\nwork from the engine, this memory could not be reset without incurring\nan erasure cost at least equal to the work extracted. Unlike the\nanalysis from Szilard to Brillouin, the consistency of statistical\nmechanics now requires us to say at least something about the demon\nitself as a physical being, constrained by a particular kind of\nphysical law. The demon may be able to perform measurements\nnon-dissipatively, but its memory must be representable by a\nphysical device, and this device must be included in the statistical\nmechanical description. This contrasts sharply with Brillouin.\nBrillouin characterised information as \u201cbound\u201d if it was\nembodied in the states of a physical device, but he explicitly stated\nthat information contained only in the mind was \u201cfree\u201d,\nnot \u201cbound\u201d.\n\n\nThe relationship between entropy and information now becomes less\nclear. With the demon left out of the system, it is free to be\nconsidered an agent, who has information about the system. The\nuncertainty in the description of the system may be thought of as the\ndemon's lack of knowledge about the exact state of the system. If the\ndemon has more information, the entropy of the system is\nless. However, once the demon can acquire information\nnon-dissipatively, the entropy of the system goes down and the only\ncompensation seems to be an increase in the uncertainty of the demon's\nstate itself.\n\n\nIf the state of the demon's own mind must now be included\nin the system, with uncertainty over which state the demon is\nin, that raises the question: \u201cWhose\nuncertainty?\u201d. Perhaps it is the uncertainty the demon has at\nthe start of the process about which state it will be in? Perhaps the\nstatistical distribution should be abandoned, as the demon is not\nuncertain about its own state, but that another property\u2014such as\nthe proposal of Zurek\u2014has changed by a compensating amount?\nPerhaps the demon has been naturalised to the point that it no longer\nrepresents an intelligent agent, possessing and acting on information,\nand the uncertainty is now another, external agent's uncertainty? In\nthe latter case it would appear any hope of using the Szilard engine\nto answer Smoluchowski's original concern, about intelligent\nintervention, has been lost entirely.\n\n\nFor Penrose and Bennett's resolution to succeed, it is necessary that\nthe demon be conceived of as a particular type of physical system, as\nthe physical constitution of the demon's memory must now be taken into\naccount. If the demon is presumed to be representable by a Hamiltonian\nsystem, then it has been reduced to a mechanical device, not too\ndissimilar to Smoluchowski's trapdoor and spring. It is not so\nsurprising that being a Hamiltonian system, and subject to Liouville's\nTheorem, might naturally lay some physical constraint upon a demon,\nrendering it tamable. However, the existence and exact nature of this\nconstraint, and the possibility of a corresponding modified second\nlaw, remains open to debate and depends in a large measure on the\napproach taken to understanding statistical mechanics.\n\n\nIn the dissipationless measurements of Landauer et al., measurement\nstill requires the development of correlations between physical\nsystems, through interaction. The demonless engines of Popper et al.\nindicate that the only physical aspect of this process that is\nrelevant is precisely this correlated interaction, and that the\nquestion of whether the interaction is for the purpose of information\ngathering is not, in itself, of significance. While advocates of the\ninformation theoretic approach might argue that the\ncorrelation is information, the arguments of Maroney and of\nShenker and Hemmo would appear to challenge whether maintaining this\ncorrelation is even necessary to understand the operation of the\nengine. It may be asked whether the characterisation of the\ncorrelation as \u201cinformation\u201d is actually playing any role,\nor whether this is just a trivial relabelling exercise? If the term\ninformation adds nothing to the understanding of statistical mechanics\nthen it could be purged from the description (of course, this still\nleaves open the possibility that statistical mechanics has non-trivial\nimplications for the physics of information processing).\n\n\nBoth the Szilard engine and Landauer's principle seem to raise a\nsimilar problem about the relationship between knowledge and\nthermodynamic entropy: if one could know which side of the\nengine the molecule was located, one could extract work; if one could\nknow which logical state the device was in, one could set it\nto zero without work. Without this knowledge, it is necessary to design\na process that acts independently of the specific state the system is\nin. But it is plain that this does not tell us that, even\nwithout the knowledge, it is impossible to design a clever\nprocess that can still extract the work from engine without\ncompensation, or a clever process that can still reset the bit without\nwork. Hamiltonian mechanics and Liouville's Theorem seems to play a\nvital, if largely unnoticed, role. As Zhang and Zhang's demon\ndemonstrates, unconstrained violations of the second law are clearly\npossible given non-Hamiltonian flows and no appeal to information\ntheory or computation would seem able to avoid this.\n",
