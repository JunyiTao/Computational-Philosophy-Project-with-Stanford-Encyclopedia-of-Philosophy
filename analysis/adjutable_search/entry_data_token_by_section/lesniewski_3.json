    "main_text": "Development of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Logical Systems || Early Mereology\n3.1 Early Mereology\n\n \nThe original (1916) formulation of Mereology, not yet so called, and\nnot yet formalized with special symbols, had the primitive concept\n\u2018part\u2019, four axioms and three definitions at its basis.\nThey are:\n\n\nAxiom I. If object \\(A\\) is part of object \\(B\\), then\n\\(B\\) is not part of \\(A\\)\n\n \nAxiom II. If object \\(A\\) is part of object \\(B\\), and\nobject \\(B\\) is part of object \\(C\\), then \\(A\\) is part\nof C.\n\n\n \nThese specify respectively the asymmetry and transitivity of the\npart relation.\n\n \nDefinition I. The expression \u2018ingredient of object\n\\(A\\)\u2019 is used to denote \\(A\\), and every part of\n\\(A\\).\n\n\n\n \nThat is: Object \\(B\\) is an ingredient of object \\(A\\) if\nand only if either \\(B\\) is \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is part of\n\\(A\\). Nowadays the term \u2018ingredient\u2019 is often simply\nrendered as \u2018part\u2019 and Le\u015bniewski\u2019s\n\u2018part\u2019 is called \u2018proper part\u2019.\n\n \nDefinition II. The expression \u2018set\n[mnogo\u015b\u0107] of objects \\(m\\)\u2019 is used to\ndenote every object \\(A\\) such that if \\(B\\) is any\ningredient of \\(A\\), then some ingredient of \\(B\\) is an\ningredient of some \\(m\\), and this \\(m\\) is an ingredient of\n\\(A\\).\n\n\n\n \nThat is: \\(A\\) is a set of \\(m\\) if and only if every\ningredient of \\(A\\) has a common ingredient with (mereologically\noverlaps) some \\(m\\), and this \\(m\\) is part of \\(A\\).\nIntuitively, a set of \\(m\\) is what we would now call a\nmereological sum, consisting of one or more \\(m\\), but not\nnecessarily all of the \\(m\\).\n\n \nDefinition III. The expressions \u2018set of all objects\n\\(m\\)\u2019 and \u2018class [klasa] of objects\n\\(m\\)\u2019 are used to denote every object \\(A\\) such that\n(i) every \\(m\\) is an ingredient of \\(A\\), and (ii) if\n\\(B\\) is an ingredient of \\(A\\), then some ingredient of\n\\(B\\) is an ingredient of some \\(m\\).\n\n\n\n \nThat is: a class of \\(m\\) is a set of all the \\(m\\). The\nremaining two axioms state that such classes exist and are unique:\n\n\n Axiom III. If some object is (an) \\(m\\), then some object is a\nclass of objects \\(m\\).\n\n \nAxiom IV. If \\(A\\) is a class of objects \\(m\\), and\n\\(B\\) is a class of objects \\(m\\), then \\(A\\) is\n\\(B\\).\n\n\n \nWith these axioms we may speak of \u2018the class of\n\\(m\\)\u2019 whenever there is at least one \\(m\\).\n\n In terms of these basic principles, Le\u015bniewski proves a number of\ntheorems and defines several important mereological concepts, such as\noverlapping (having an ingredient in common) and being exterior to\n(having no ingredient in common). It is characteristic of this essay\nthat Le\u015bniewski is keen to appropriate the terminology of set\ntheory for his own purposes. Further terminology includes\n\u2018element\u2019, which is defined as follows:\n\n \nDefinition IV. The term \u2018element of object \\(A\\)\u2019\nis used to denote any object \\(B\\) which, for some meaning of the\nexpression \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019, is such that (i) \\(A\\) is the\nclass of objects \\(x\\), and (ii) \\(B\\) is (an)\n\\(x\\).\n\n\n\n \nIt is swiftly proved that the ingredients of \\(A\\) and the\nelements of \\(A\\) are the same. The definition illustrates how\nLe\u015bniewski formulated the idea of quantification in his early\nsemi-prose work: instead of \u201cfor some \\(x\\)\u201d he says\n\u201cfor some meaning of the expression \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019\n\u201d. When showing all ingredients of an object are its elements,\nLe\u015bniewski instantiates the bound variable by saying \u201cUsing\nthe expression \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 with the meaning of the\nexpression \u2018ingredient of the object \\(A\\)\u2019\n\u2026\u201d. We will return to this below when discussing\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s understanding of the quantifiers.\n\n By Le\u015bniewski\u2019s own later and very exacting standards, this\nfirst formulation of Mereology is methodologically imperfect, because\nit intersperses axioms and definitions. A cleaner formulation would\nexpress all axioms in terms of the mereological primitive (here\n\u2018part\u2019) only. This would be possible in this case simply by\nsubstituting the definitions of defined terms in Axioms III and IV, but\nit would not be especially enlightening. It also results in an axiom\nsystem that can be substantially simplified, both by reducing the\nnumber of axioms and by simplifying and shortening them. These\ndesiderata (fewer, shorter, and more perspicuous axioms) often\npull in different directions.\n",
