    "main_text": "Key Ethical Issues in Internet Research || Internet Research and Industry Ethics\n4.6 Internet Research and Industry Ethics\n\nThe Facebook emotional contagion experiment, discussed above, is just\none example in a larger trend of big data research conducted outside\nof traditional university-based research ethics oversight mechanisms.\nNearly all online companies and platforms analyze data and test\ntheories that often rely on data from individual users. Industry-based\ndata research, once limited to marketing-oriented \u201cA/B\ntesting\u201d of benign changes in interface designs or corporate\ncommunication messages, now encompasses information about how users\nbehave online, what they click and read, how they move, eat, and\nsleep, the content they consume online, and even how they move about\ntheir homes. Such research produces inferences about\nindividuals\u2019 tastes and preferences, social relations,\ncommunications, movements, and work habits. It implies pervasive\ntesting of products and services that are an integral part of intimate\ndaily life, ranging from connected home products to social networks to\nsmart cars. Except in cases where they are partnering with academic\ninstitutions, companies typically do not put internal research\nactivities through a formal ethical review process, since results are\ntypically never shared publicly and the perceived impact on users is\nminimal.\n\nThe growth of industry-based big data research, however, presents new\nrisks to individuals\u2019 privacy, on the one hand, and to\norganizations\u2019 legal compliance, reputation, and brand, on the\nother hand. When organizations process personal data outside of their\noriginal context, individuals may in some cases greatly benefit, but\nin other cases may be surprised, outraged, or even harmed. Soliciting\nconsent from affected individuals can be impractical: Organizations\nmight collect data indirectly or based on identifiers that do not\ndirectly match individuals\u2019 contact details. Moreover, by\ndefinition, some non-contextual uses\u2014including the retention of\ndata for longer than envisaged for purposes of a newly emergent\nuse\u2014may be unforeseen at the time of collection. As Crawford and\nSchultz (2014) note,\n\n\nhow does one give notice and get consent for innumerable and perhaps\neven yet-to-be-determined queries that one might run that create\n\u201cpersonal data\u201d? (2014: 108)\n\n\nWith corporations developing vast \u201cliving laboratories\u201d\nfor big data research, research ethics has become a critical component\nof the design and oversight of these activities. For example, in\nresponse to the controversy surrounding the emotional contagion\nexperiment, Facebook developed an internal ethical review process\nthat, according to its facilitators,\n\n\nleverages the company\u2019s organizational structure, creating\nmultiple training opportunities and research review checkpoints in the\nexisting organizational flow (Jackman & Kanerva 2016: 444).\n\n\nWhile such efforts are important and laudable, they remain open for\nimprovement. Hoffmann (2016), for example, has criticized Facebook for\nlaunching\n\n\nan ethics review process that innovates on process but tells us little\nabout the ethical values informing their product development.\n\n\nFurther, in their study of employees doing the work of ethics inside\nof numerous Silicon Valley companies, Metcalf and colleagues found\nconsiderable tension between trying to resolve thorny ethical dilemmas\nthat emerge within an organization\u2019s data practices and the\nbroader business model and corporate logic that dominates internal\ndecision-making (Metcalf, Moss, & boyd 2019).\n",
