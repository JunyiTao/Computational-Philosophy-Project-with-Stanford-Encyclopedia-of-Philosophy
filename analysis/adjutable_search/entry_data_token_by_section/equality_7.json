    "main_text": "Conceptions of Distributive Equality: Equality of What? || Simple Equality and Objections to Equality in General\n3.1 Simple Equality and Objections to Equality in General\n\nSimple equality, meaning everyone being furnished with the\nsame material level of goods and services, represents a strict\nposition as far as distributive justice is concerned. It is generally\nrejected as untenable.\n\nHence, with the possible exception of Babeuf (1796) and Shaw (1928),\nno prominent author or movement has demanded strict equality. Since\negalitarianism has come to be widely associated with the demand for\neconomic equality, and this in turn with communistic or socialistic\nideas, it is important to stress that neither communism nor socialism\n\u2013 despite their protest against poverty and exploitation and\ntheir demand for social security for all citizens \u2013 calls for\nabsolute economic equality. The orthodox Marxist view of economic\nequality was expounded in the Critique of the Gotha Program\n(1875). Marx here rejects the idea of legal equality, on three\ngrounds. First, he indicates, equality draws on a limited number of\nmorally relevant perspectives and neglects others, thus having unequal\neffects. In Marx\u2019s view, the economic structure is the most\nfundamental basis for the historical development of society, and is\nthus the point of reference for explaining its features. Second,\ntheories of justice have concentrated excessively on distribution\ninstead of the basic questions of production. Third, a future\ncommunist society needs no law and no justice, since social conflicts\nwill have vanished.\n\nAs an idea, simple equality fails because of problems that\nare raised in regards to equality in general. It is useful to review\nthese problems, as they require resolution in any plausible approach\nto equality.\n\n(i) We need adequate indices for the measurement of the equality of\nthe goods to be distributed. Through what concepts should equality and\ninequality be understood? It is thus clear that equality of material\ngoods can lead to unequal satisfaction. Money constitutes a typical,\nthough inadequate, index; at the very least, equal opportunity has to\nbe conceived in other terms.\n\n(ii) The time span needs to be indicated for realizing the desired\nmodel of equal distribution (McKerlie 1989, Sikora 1989). Should we\nseek to equalize the goods in question over complete individual\nlifetimes, or should we seek to ensure that various life segments are\nas equally provisioned as possible?\n\n(iii) Equality distorts incentives promoting achievement in the\neconomic field, and the administrative costs of redistribution produce\nwasteful inefficiencies (Okun 1975). Equality and efficiency need to\nbe balanced. Often, Pareto-optimality is demanded in this respect,\nusually by economists. A social condition is Pareto-optimal or\nPareto-efficient when it is not possible to shift to another condition\njudged better by at least one person and worse by none (Sen 1970,\nchap. 2, 2*). A widely discussed alternative to the Pareto principle\nis the Kaldor-Hicks welfare criterion. This stipulates that a rise in\nsocial welfare is always present when the benefits accruing through\nthe distribution of value in a society exceed the corresponding costs.\nA change thus becomes desirable when the winners in such a change\ncould compensate the losers for their losses, and still retain a\nsubstantial profit. In contrast to the Pareto-criterion, the\nKaldor-Hicks criterion contains a compensation rule (Kaldor 1939). For\npurposes of economic analysis, such theoretical models of optimal\nefficiency make a great deal of sense. However, the analysis is always\nmade relative to a starting situation that can itself be unjust and\nunequal. A society can thus be (close to) Pareto-optimality \u2013\ni.e., no one can increase his or her material goods or freedoms\nwithout diminishing those of someone else \u2013 while also\ndisplaying enormous inequalities in the distribution of the same goods\nand freedoms. For this reason, egalitarians claim that it may be\nnecessary to reduce Pareto-optimality for the sake of justice, if\nthere is no more egalitarian distribution that is also Pareto-optimal.\nIn the eyes of their critics, equality of whatever kind should not\nlead to some people having to make do with less, when this equalizing\ndown does not benefit any of those who are in a worse position.\n\n(iv) Moral objections: A strict and mechanical equal\ndistribution between all individuals does not sufficiently take into\naccount the differences among individuals and their situations. In\nessence, since individuals desire different things, why should\neveryone receive the same goods? Intuitively, for example, we can\nrecognize that a sick person has other claims than a healthy person,\nand furnishing each with the same goods would be mistaken. With simple\nequality, personal freedoms are unacceptably limited and distinctive\nindividual qualities insufficiently acknowledged; in this way they are\nin fact unequally regarded. Furthermore, persons not only have a moral\nright to their own needs being considered, but a right and a duty to\ntake responsibility for their own decisions and the resulting\nconsequences.\n\nWorking against the identification of distributive justice with simple\nequality, a basic postulate of many present-day egalitarians\nis as follows: human beings are themselves responsible for certain\ninequalities resulting from their free decisions; aside from minimum\naid in emergencies, they deserve no recompense for such inequalities\n(but cf. relational egalatarians, discussed in Section\n 4).\nOn the other hand, they are due compensation for inequalities that are\nnot the result of self-chosen options. For egalitarians, the world is\nmorally better when equality of life conditions prevail. This\nis an amorphous ideal demanding further clarification. Why is such\nequality an ideal, and what precise currency of equality does it\ninvolve?\n\nBy the same token, most egalitarians do not advocate an equality of\noutcome, but different kinds of equality of opportunity, due to their\nemphasis on a pair of morally central points: that individuals are\nresponsible for their decisions, and that the only things to be\nconsidered objects of equality are those which serve the real\ninterests of individuals. The opportunities to be equalized between\npeople can be opportunities for well-being (i.e. objective welfare),\nor for preference satisfaction (i.e., subjective welfare), or for\nresources. It is not equality of objective or subjective well-being or\nresources themselves that should be equalized, but an equal\nopportunity to gain the well-being or resources one aspires to. Such\nequality depends on their being a realm of options for each individual\nequal to the options enjoyed by all other persons, in the sense of the\nsame prospects for fulfillment of preferences or the possession of\nresources. The opportunity must consist of possibilities one can\nreally take advantage of. Equal opportunity prevails when human beings\neffectively enjoy equal realms of possibility.\n\n(v) Simple equality is very often associated with equality of results\n(although these are two distinct concepts). However, to strive only\nfor equality of results is problematic. To illustrate the point, let\nus briefly limit the discussion to a single action and the event or\nstate of affairs resulting from it. Arguably, actions should not be\njudged solely by the moral quality of their results, as important as\nthis may be. One must also consider the way in which the events or\ncircumstances to be evaluated have come about. Generally speaking, a\nmoral judgement requires not only the assessment of the results of the\naction in question (the consequentialist aspect) but, first and\nforemost, the assessment of the intention of the actor (the\ndeontological aspect). The source and its moral quality influence the\nmoral judgement of the results (Pogge 1999, sect. V). For example, if\nyou strike me, your blow will hurt me; the pain I feel may be\nconsidered bad in itself, but the moral status of your blow will also\ndepend on whether you were (morally) allowed such a gesture (perhaps\nthrough parental status, although that is controversial) or even\nobliged to execute it (e.g. as a police officer preventing me from\ndoing harm to others), or whether it was in fact prohibited but not\nprevented. What is true of individual actions (or their omission) has\nto be true mutatis mutandis of social institutions and\ncircumstances like distributions resulting from collective social\nactions (or their omission). Social institutions should therefore be\nassessed not only on the basis of information about how they affect\nindividual quality of life. A society in which people starve on the\nstreets is certainly marked by inequality; nevertheless, its moral\nquality, i.e., whether the society is just or unjust with regard to\nthis problem, also depends on the suffering\u2019s causes. Does the society\nallow starvation as an unintended but tolerable side effect of what\nits members see as a just distributive scheme? Indeed, does it even\ndefend the suffering as a necessary means, as with forms of Social\nDarwinism? Or has the society taken measures against starvation which\nhave turned out to be insufficient? In the latter case, whether the\nsociety has taken such steps for reasons of political morality or\nefficiency again makes a moral difference. Hence even for\negalitarians, equality of results is too narrow and one-sided a\nfocus.\n\n(vi) Finally, there is a danger of (strict) equality leading to\nuniformity, rather than to a respect for pluralism and democracy\n(Cohen 1989; Arneson 1993). In the contemporary debate, this complaint\nhas been mainly articulated in feminist and multiculturalist theory. A\ncentral tenet of feminist theory is that gender has been and remains a\nhistorically variable and internally differentiated relation of\ndomination. The same holds for so-called racial and ethnic\ndifferences, which are often still conceived of as marking different\nvalues. The different groups involved here rightly object to their\ndiscrimination, marginalization, and domination, and an appeal to\nequality of status thus seems a solution. However, as feminists and\nmulticulturalists have pointed out, equality, as usually understood\nand practiced, is constituted in part by a denial and ranking of\ndifferences; as a result it seems less useful as an antidote to\nrelations of domination. \u201cEquality\u201d can often mean the\nassimilation to a pre-existing and problematic \u2018male\u2019 or\n\u2018white\u2019 or \u2018middle class\u2019 norm. In short,\ndomination and a fortiori inequality often arises out of an inability\nto appreciate and nurture differences, not out of a failure to see\neveryone as the same. To recognize these differences should however\nnot lead to an essentialism grounded in sexual or cultural\ncharacteristics. There is a crucial debate between those who insist\nthat sexual, racial, and ethnic differences should become irrelevant,\non the one hand, and those believing that such differences, even\nthough culturally relevant, should not furnish a basis for inequality:\nthat one should rather find mechanisms for securing equality, despite\nvalued differences. Neither of these strategies involves rejecting\nequality. The dispute is about how equality is to be attained\n(McKinnon 1989, Taylor 1992).\n\nProposing a connection between equality and pluralism, Michael\nWalzer\u2019s theory (1983) aims at what he calls \u201ccomplex\nequality\u201d. According to Walzer, relevant reasons can only speak\nin favor of distributing specific types of goods in specific spheres,\nnot in several or all spheres. Against a theory of simple equality\npromoting equal distribution of dominant goods, which underestimates\nthe complexity of the criteria at work in each given sphere, the\ndominance of particular goods needs to be ended. For instance,\npurchasing power in the political sphere through means derived from\nthe economic sphere (i.e., money) must be prevented. Walzer\u2019s theory\nof complex equality is not actually aimed at equality per se, but at\nthe separation of spheres of justice; the theory\u2019s designation is\nmisleading. Any theory of equality should, however, as per Walzer,\navoid monistic conceptions and recognize instead the complexity of\nlife and the plurality of criteria for justice.\n\nThe preceding considerations yield the following desideratum: instead\nof simple equality, a more complex equality needs to\nbe conceptualized. That concept should resolve the problems discussed\nabove through a distinction of various classes of goods, a separation\nof spheres, and a differentiation of relevant criteria.\n",
