Usually, we seem to have no trouble engaging with\ntime-travel or space-exploration stories, superhero movies, or talking\nnon-human animal fables. At other times, we do not seem to be able to\nplay along that easily; for instance, when we are presented with an\nalternative Macbeth where\n\n\nthe facts of [Duncan\u2019s] murder remain as they are in fact\npresented in the play, but it is prescribed in this alternate fiction\nthat this was unfortunate only for having interfered with\nMacbeth\u2019s sleep. (Moran 1994: 95)\n\n\nThe imaginative resistance debate came about as an attempt to unpack\nwhat\u2019s going on in these special, puzzling cases. It is no\nsurprise that Tamar Szab\u00f3 Gendler referred to the phenomenon as\n\u201cthe puzzle of imaginative resistance\u201d (2000). Since the\nphenomenon seems to be relatively narrow, the driving force behind\nscholars\u2019 interest in it has been the possibility of drawing\ninsights from analyses of this relatively insulated phenomenon for\nbroader, hard-to-pin-down issues, such as the ethics-aesthetics\nrelation, the nature of fiction and imagination, the functional role\nof imagination, and how imagination relates to belief and other\nstates. (See Gendler and Liao 2016: 412\u201315, for a detailed\nsurvey of various accounts that use imaginative resistance related\ninsights for solving a range of different philosophical problems.)\nHowever, as with any new and rapidly growing area of research, there\nhas been much disagreement and confusion among scholars as to the\nprecise nature of the phenomenon. Indeed, scholars disagree on\n\nwhether such a phenomenon exists;\nwhether it is really puzzling;\nwhether it is puzzling for various reasons, and if so, whether\nthese reasons are reducible to others;\nwhether we resist imagining only moral deviations or whether the\nphenomenon is broader than that;\nwhether the resistance to engaging in the imaginative activity is\na result of the subject\u2019s inability to engage in the prompted\nactivity or the subject\u2019s unwillingness to do so; and\nwhether imaginative resistance cases put constraints on our\ncognitive imagination or conative imagination, or whether they have\nnothing to do with imagination at all.\n\n\nAs Kendall Walton puts it, the only thing that has been uncontested is\nthe word \u201cof\u201d in \u201cthe puzzle of imaginative\nresistance\u201d (2006: 146).\n\nThis entry is an attempt to get clear on the central issues\nsurrounding imaginative resistance and examines the proposed solutions\nto the puzzle(s).\n", "toc": [{"#WhatPuzzAbouImagResi": "What is Puzzling About Imaginative Resistance?"}, {"#PuzzImagResiOrig": "1.1 The Puzzle of Imaginative Resistance: The Origins"}, {"#PuzzImagResi": "1.2 Puzzle(s) of Imaginative Resistance"}, {"#DepeFundRelaBetwPuzz": "1.3 Dependency and Fundamentality Relations between the Puzzles"}, {"#Resi": "2.

It is this\narticle by Moran, as well as Kendall Walton\u2019s article from the\nsame year, \u201cMorals in Fiction and Fictional Morality\u201d,\nthat have ignited the interest in imaginative resistance. These\narticles respectively grow out of Moran\u2019s talk at the 1992\nAmerican Society for Aesthetics Annual Meeting\u2014then titled\n\u201cArt, Imagination, and Resistance\u201d\u2014and\nWalton\u2019s commentary on Moran\u2019s talk. Moran\u2019s main\naim in \u201cThe Expression of Feeling in Imagination\u201d is to\ncriticize Walton\u2019s account of fictional emotions and more\nspecifically what Moran perceives as a discontinuity in the account\nbetween the uses of imagination in our real-life engagements and in\nour engagements with fictional works. In doing so, he discusses a\nspecial phenomenon\u2014he dubs it \u201cimaginative\nresistance\u201d\u2014that, he believes, helps him to problematize\nWalton\u2019s account. Walton himself mentions the phenomenon in his\n1990 book Mimesis as Make-believe and describes it as a\ncurious psychological reluctance to allow fictional worlds to differ\nfrom the actual world in certain moral aspects (see Walton 1990:\n154\u20135). However, this is not the first time this phenomenon is\ndiscussed in philosophical aesthetics. \n\nWalton refers to David Hume as the first philosopher to diagnose the\nphenomenon of imaginative resistance. All of Hume\u2019s remarks on\nimaginative resistance take place in few paragraphs towards the end of\nhis essay \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d (1757). There, Hume\nstates that, even though it requires some effort, we can still engage\nwith artworks that depict variations or deviations from what we are\naccustomed to, such as \u201cprincesses carrying water from the\nspring, and kings and heroes dressing their own victuals\u201d or any\nother \u201cinnocent peculiarities of manners\u201d and\n\u201cspeculative errors\u201d (1757 [1875: 245\u20136]). However,\nhe claims, there is a stark contrast between the ease of our\nengagement with such works and with works that depict moral deviations\nwithout proper approbation and blame. He writes,\n\n\nwhere the ideas of morality and decency alter from one age to another,\nand where vicious manners are described, without being marked with the\nproper characters of blame and disapprobation; this must be allowed to\ndisfigure the poem, and to be a real deformity. I cannot, nor is it\nproper I should, enter into such sentiments; and however I may excuse\nthe poet, on account of the manners of his age, I never can relish the\ncomposition. (1757 [1875: 246\u20137])\n\n\nHume\u2019s view is not merely that we resist engaging with works\nthat depict certain moral content that we disapprove of. Rather, the\nlack of blame or disapprobation on the side of the author is what we\nfind bothersome and it requires \u201ca very violent effort\u201d on\nthe side of the audience to \n\n\nchange\u2026 [their] judgment of manners, and excite sentiments of\napprobation or blame, love or hatred, different from those to which\nthe mind from long custom has been familiarized. (247) \n\n\n(See Walton 1994, Dadlez 2002, Gendler 2006, Dorsch 2016: 48\u201351\nfor more detailed examinations of Hume\u2019s remarks.) \n\nTwo things informed contemporary philosophers\u2019 initial\ncharacterization of imaginative resistance. The first is the curious\nasymmetry Hume detected between imagining morally and nonmorally\ndeviant content. The second is the blurring of the division between\nwhat is actual and what is fictional when it comes to depictions of\nmoral deviance (see Moran 1994, Walton 1994, Gendler 2000, Currie\n2002, Matravers 2003). Gendler identifies \u201cthe puzzle of\nimaginative resistance\u201d as \u201cthe puzzle of explaining our\ncomparative difficulty in imagining fictional worlds that we take to\nbe morally deviant\u201d (2000: 56). She further elaborates on the\npuzzle by pointing out the relative restrictions imposed on the\nauthor\u2019s authority to make things true in the world of the\nmorally deviant fiction: even though the author seems to exercise a\ngreat deal of freedom when it comes to depictions of such things as\nflying cars and talking mice, it is rather puzzling that this freedom\nseems to be taken away or restricted once the author describes,\nlet\u2019s say, female infanticide or slavery as morally correct. In\nthese cases, she claims, we experience a \u201cdoubling of the\nnarrator\u201d (2000: 64). We regard the moral justification of\nfemale infanticide or slavery not as true in the story but as\nmerely something that the narrator thinks. It is as if we\nwant to respond to the narrator by saying \u201cThat\u2019s what you\nthink\u201d. What is puzzling is that in these special cases we\nbecome so aware of narrators themselves that it undermines the whole\npractice of producing and consuming fiction.\n1.2 Puzzle(s) of Imaginative Resistance\n\nThe use of the word \u201cpuzzle\u201d in \u201cthe puzzle of\nimaginative resistance\u201d has been criticized for masking the\nmultiplicity of puzzles related the phenomenon and this has led to a\nchange in the term with consensus among the believers in imaginative\nresistance from \u201cpuzzle\u201d to \u201cpuzzles\u201d. Four of\nthese puzzles are first identified by Brian Weatherson (2004).\n\nConsider the following story by Weatherson (2004: 1):\n\n\nDeath on a Freeway\n\nJack and Jill were arguing again. This was not in itself unusual, but\nthis time they were standing in the fast lane of I-95 having their\nargument. This was causing traffic to bank up a bit. It wasn\u2019t\nsignificantly worse than normally happened around Providence, not that\nyou could have told that from the reactions of passing motorists. They\nwere convinced that Jack and Jill, and not the volume of traffic, were\nthe primary causes of the slowdown. They all forgot how bad traffic\nnormally is along there. When Craig saw that the cause of the backup\nhad been Jack and Jill, he took his gun out of the glovebox and shot\nthem. People then started driving over their bodies, and while the new\nspeed hump caused some people to slow down a bit, mostly traffic\nreturned to its normal speed. So Craig did the right thing, because\nJack and Jill should have taken their argument somewhere else where\nthey wouldn\u2019t get in anyone\u2019s way.\n\n\nThe last sentence of Death triggers a variety of reactions\nthat give rise to distinct puzzles:\n\nImaginative puzzle: Even though we have no trouble imagining the\nrest of the story as it is, we experience difficulties in imagining\nthat Craig did the right thing. While we generally play along with\nworks of fiction in the sense that we imagine what the work asks us to\nimagine, in some instances like the moral justification of\nCraig\u2019s action, we resist imagining what we are asked to. Why\ndon\u2019t we play along in such cases?\nFictionality puzzle (previously called \u201cAlethic\npuzzle\u201d by Weatherson (2004); renamed by Walton (2006)): Even\nthough we have no trouble accepting the rest of the story as\nfictionally true (that it is fictionally true that there was a traffic\njam in I-95, that Craig has a gun in his glovebox and that he shot\nJack and Jill, etc.), we experience difficulties accepting that it is\nfictionally true that Craig did the right thing. Given that the author\nis supposed to have sole authority to make things true in the world of\nthe fiction, it is rather surprising that there is an authorial\nbreakdown when it comes to making Craig\u2019s action morally\nright.\nPhenomenological puzzle: The last sentence of Death pops\nout as striking or jarring. It has an odd \u2018feel\u2019 that the\nother sentences in the story don\u2019t. What explains this\ndistinctive phenomenological feature? (See Gendler 2006: 156\u201362\non the pop-out effect)\nAesthetic puzzle (sometimes called \u201cAesthetic-Value\nPuzzle\u201d): Does the inclusion of sentences like the last sentence\nof Death compromise works of fiction aesthetically? There are\ntwo different ways to interpret the aesthetic puzzle.\n\n\nThe aesthetic puzzle as an extension of the fictionality puzzle:\nWorks of fiction which include moral claims that do not line up with\nthe descriptions provided of the fictional situation are aesthetically\ncompromised. The aesthetic puzzle involves figuring out why this is\nso. The aesthetic defect caused by a deviant sentence lies, at least\npartially, in its problematic fictionality status. (See Weatherson\n2004: 2 for this formulation of the aesthetic puzzle.)\nThe aesthetic puzzle as an extension of the imaginative puzzle:\nThere might be various reasons for moral failings of a work to affect\naesthetic engagement. The aesthetic puzzle concerns a very specific\nkind of reason. Here, the issue is not merely that there is something\nmorally problematic in the work. Surely, one can morally object to an\nartwork on the grounds of their moral disagreement, let\u2019s say,\nwith the work\u2019s message. For instance, one can object to the\nmovie American Psycho on the grounds that it glorifies\nviolence. Whether and how in these cases moral defects can or should\ncount as aesthetic defects has been discussed under the rubric of\nethical criticism of artworks (for survey, see Carroll 2000; for an\nupdate, see Eaton 2016). The aesthetic puzzle is not directly related\nto ethical criticism although insights drawn from analyzing the\naesthetic puzzle can be used to defend a view within the ethical\ncriticism debate. (See Eaton 2012 for her defense of immoralism where\nshe argues that lack of imaginative resistance toward morally deviant\nscenarios should count as an aesthetic merit.) In the cases of\nimaginative resistance, we see that we cannot easily compartmentalize\nand separate our ethical and aesthetic considerations. The aesthetic\npuzzle arises when even the idea of engaging with a work that has\nmorally repugnant content, say, one that glorifies white supremacy,\nitself feels completely wrong and repulsive. This is rather puzzling\nbecause after all, it is all supposed to be fictional, make-believe.\nWhy do we have so much anxiety over imaging something the author asks\nus to imagine and aesthetically engage with the work? This puzzling\nreaction is an extension of the reaction that is discussed under the\nimaginative puzzle. In these cases, as Walton writes,\n\n\n\n[w]hen moral considerations prevent us from appreciating a work of\nfiction, this is often, though not always, because we are unable or\nunwilling to imagine in the way the work calls for. This is the link\nbetween the aesthetic puzzle and the imaginative one. (2006: 140)\n\n \n\n\nDistinguishing the puzzles more precisely not only allows for greater\nconceptual clarity but also helps with reevaluating the previous work\ndone on imaginative resistance, giving us the ability to distinguish\nreal disagreements from pseudo-disagreements. We can reposition these\naccounts with respect to one another depending on which puzzles they\nare addressing. For instance, while Stephen Yablo (2002) focuses\nsolely on the fictionality puzzle, Gregory Currie (2002), Currie and\nRavenscroft (2002), Peter Goldie (2003), and Shaun Nichols (2006a)\naddress merely the imaginative puzzle. Moran (1994) and Walton (1994)\ntalk about all the puzzles except for the phenomenological puzzle.\nGendler (2000) and Derek Matravers (2003) discuss both the imaginative\nand fictionality puzzle. Gendler (2000) has been criticized heavily\nfor conflating the imaginative and fictionality puzzles; she\nacknowledges this problem and provides a revised version of her\naccount (2006). \n1.3 Dependency and Fundamentality Relations between the Puzzles\n\nEven though there is a consensus among believers in imaginative\nresistance that there are puzzles of imaginative resistance, there is\na dissensus on which puzzles to include. This dissensus is also\nindicative of disagreements concerning the dependency and\nfundamentality relations between the puzzles. \n\nWalton has been pushing the line on disentangling the imaginative and\nfictionality puzzles. He states that while the fictionality puzzle\nconcerns what is and isn\u2019t fictional,\n\n\n[t]he imaginative puzzle concerns not what is or isn\u2019t\nfictional, but what we do or do not imagine. These are different; I\nmay recognize that something is fictional, true in the world of a\nstory, without actually imagining it, or imagine something that I take\nnot to be fictional. (2006: 140)\n\n\nWalton (2006) claims that the fictionality puzzle is more\nphilosophically interesting than its counterpart. The imaginative\npuzzle concerns why we refuse to, or are unable to, engage with the\nprompted imagining. Walton thinks that refusal-based imaginative\npuzzles are not puzzling at all and that it is a matter of empirical\nstudy to determine when and how and why they happen (2006: 143). (See\nLiao et al. 2014 for an empirical study which concludes, contra\nWalton, that reactions to the imaginative puzzle and fictionality\npuzzle correlate). Nevertheless, Walton remarks that both puzzles\nshould be connected since fictionality is defined in terms of\nimagining (2006: 144). \n\nIt is questionable the degree of credence he continues to assign to\nthis view, given that Walton (2015), recanting his earlier reductive\naccount of fictionality\u2014according to which \u201c[a]\nproposition is fictional\u2026 just in case there is a prescription\nto the effect that it is to be imagined\u201d\u2014claims that\n\u201cprescriptions to imagine are necessary but not sufficient for\nfictionality\u201d (2015: 17). Walton (2015) states that fictionality\nturns out to be more fundamental than he had originally thought\n(Walton 1990\u2014up to 2015). \n\nKathleen Stock (2017), defending a different theory of truth in\nfiction, i.e., extreme intentionalism, dismisses the fictionality\npuzzle as a pseudo-puzzle. According to extreme intentionalism, \n\n\nthe fictional content of a particular text is equivalent to exactly\nwhat the author of the text intended the reader to imagine. (2017: 1)\n\n\n\nTherefore, as long as a proposition is written into a work of fiction\nwith the intention that it is to be imagined, it is fictional (2017:\n123). In this regard, Stock (2017) agrees that there are puzzles of\nimaginative resistance but disagrees that the fictionality puzzle is\none of them. \n\nCain Samuel Todd (2009), similar to Walton and Stock, states that the\nfictionality and imaginative puzzles must be separated. He claims that\n\u201cfictional truth is neither reducible to, nor straightforwardly\ndepends on, imaginability\u201d (2009: 200). Instead of arguing for\nthe fundamentality of one over the other, he denies that they are\npuzzling at all due to the fact that our resistant reactions might\ndiffer due to various factors, such as further beliefs, commitments,\nand values we hold (2009: 198). Todd is one of the representatives of\n\u201celiminativism\u201d which states that imaginative resistance\nis not a real phenomenon and does not exist outside\nphilosophers\u2019 carefully concocted scenarios. (For more on\neliminativism, see\n section 2.1.3.)\n \n\nThere are other accounts that hold the relation between the\nimaginative and fictionality puzzles to be more tightly connected.\nNils-Hennes Stear (2015) argues for the interconnectivity between the\npuzzles. The main move he makes in this regard is to conceive of the\nimaginative puzzle as normative in character, rather than\npsychological (2015: 8). With respect to the psychological construal\nof the imaginative puzzle, Stear agrees with Todd that it is not\npuzzling at all. The puzzling aspect of the imaginative puzzle on his\naccount concerns the norms of proper engagement with works of fiction,\nas does the fictionality puzzle. How do they differ? Stear writes,\n\u201cimaginative failure is a datum we must explain, and\nfictionality failure is the theoretical posit via which we explain\nit\u201d (2015: 8). (See also Gendler 2006, for an elucidation of the\nfictionality puzzle as dependent on the imaginative puzzle.)\n2. Resistance\n\nThe use of the word \u201cresistance\u201d in \u201cimaginative\nresistance\u201d has been criticized for privileging one of the rival\nexplanations of imaginative resistance over the others. Three main\nrival explanations of imaginative resistance have been provided thus\nfar: the Cantian, the Wontian, and the Eliminativist (Gendler 2006\ncoined the first two terms; Gendler and Liao 2016 the third one).\nEliminativists deny that the phenomenon exists outside\nphilosophers\u2019 carefully constructed vignettes. The remaining\ncamps, while accepting the existence of the phenomenon, present\ncompeting explanations of it. Cantians claim that imaginative\nresistance occurs when we can\u2019t engage in the prompted\nimaginative activity. Wontians, by contrast take the phenomenon to\ninvolve unwillingness (rather than inability) to engage on\nthe part of the reader or the audience. Cantians and eliminativists\nhave been critical of the use of the word \u201cresistance\u201d\nbecause the term itself seems to privilege the Wontian explanation.\nEven though some philosophers choose to use \u201cimaginative\nfailure\u201d instead of \u201cimaginative resistance\u201d, the\nreplacement term has not stuck\u2014after all, this entry itself is\ntitled \u201cimaginative resistance\u201d (see Stock 2005, Brock\n2012, Stear 2015, Tooming 2018). With the acknowledgment that\n\u201cimaginative resistance\u201d is an umbrella term for the\nphenomenon that some prefer to explain not in terms of\nresistance but inability, let\u2019s have a closer\nlook at competing explanations of imaginative resistance. \n2.1 The Sources of Resistance\n2.1.1 Cantian theories\n\nCantians take the puzzles of imaginative resistance to arise due to an\ninability. A number of different versions of cantian theories have\nbeen offered and they differ with respect to what they take to be the\ncause of the inability. There are two main strands of cantian\ntheories: (1) ones that take the cause of inability to be a violation\nof some type of dependency or grounding relation (dependency-violation\ntheories), and (2) ones that take the cause to be due to a cognitive\nmismatch (mismatch theories).\nDependency-Violation Theories\n\nThe first formulation of a cantian position appears in Walton 1994. He\nclaims that the reason why imaginers experience difficulties in\nengaging with a fictional work, say one that involves the proposition,\n\u2018In killing her baby, Giselda did the right thing; after all, it\nwas a girl\u2019 (I will refer to this proposition as G) is\nthat they cannot allow the fictional world to differ morally from the\nactual world (1994: 37). Walton writes, \n\n\nMy best suspicion [as to why we resist allowing fictional worlds to\ndiffer from the real world when we do] is that it has something to do\nwith an inability to imagine [certain kinds of dependence] relations\nbeing different from how we think they are, perhaps an inability to\nunderstand fully what it would be like for them to be different.\n(Walton 1994: 46; see also Walton 2006: 145)\n\n\nFor Walton, moral principles or properties depend or supervene on\nnatural properties or facts (1994: 45). Being morally wrong rests on\ncertain actions such as the deliberate killing of a newborn female\nchild. That\u2019s why we cannot imagine female infanticide being\nmorally right; we cannot comprehend what it even means. The dependency\nrelations obtain in all worlds\u2014in the actual world as well as in\nany fictional world. We cannot imagine the violation of these\ndependency relations even just for the sake of a story. That\u2019s\nwhy we cannot accept it as fictionally true that female infanticide is\nmorally right. \n\nWalton\u2019s explanation of the cause of the inability in terms of\nviolation of a dependency relation inspired other accounts (Yablo\n2002, Weatherson 2004, Stear 2015). Stephen Yablo claims that a\nproposition like G triggers imaginative resistance because the\nconcept it expresses is \u2018grokking\u2019 or response-enabled\n(2002: 485). Yablo defines a grokking concept as \u201cone that\nidentifies its object in part by aspects of our experience of it that\ndon\u2019t purport to be representational\u201d (2000\n Other Internet Resources).\n Their extension in a particular context depends on how we\nourselves react to them, not how we are represented as reacting or\nought to react in the fictional world (2002: 485). That\u2019s why\nthe extension of the term \u201cmorally right\u201d in the context\nof G does not depend on what the author says but on how it\nstrikes us. In this case, its extension to female infanticide strikes\nus as false, not fictionally true. \n\nWeatherson, building upon the insights he has drawn from Walton and\nYablo, suggests that the dependency relation that we are invited to\nviolate in the cases of imaginative resistance is not supervenience\nbut \u201cvirtue\u201d:\n\n\nVirtue: If p is the kind of claim that, if true,\nmust be true in virtue of lower-level facts, and if the story is about\nthose lower-level facts, then it must be true in the story that there\nis some true proposition r which is about those lower-level\nfacts such that p is true in virtue of r. (2004:\n18).\n\n\nWe cannot accept it as fictionally true that Giselda did the right\nthing because there are no lower-level facts that are specified by the\nnarrator or imported by us from our world to support it. (For more on\nexport-import relations in understanding our engagement with works of\nfiction, see\n section 2.1.2.)\n The same also holds for Craig in Death on a Freeway. The\nclaim that Craig did the right thing in killing Jack and Jill cannot\nhold in virtue of any of the lower-level facts that are specified in\nthe story, such as the fact that Craig believed that Jack and Jill\nwere the cause of the traffic jam. The higher-level facts that what\nGiselda or Craig did was wrong are not primitive but they obtain in\nvirtue of lower-level facts, such as facts about the physical features\nof their actions (2004: 16). The fictionality puzzle arises only when\nthere is a violation of virtue (2004: 24). This violation is\nresponsible for the authorial breakdown. The phenomenological and\nimaginative puzzles follow from the incoherence created by the\nviolation (2004: 18\u201320). \n\nStear (2015) presents a version of cantianism, but his version does\nnot take the imaginative failure or fictionality failure to result\nfrom a violation of some kind of metaphysical or conceptual necessity\nbut rather takes it to result from lack of a proper grounding\nrelation. Taking up on some of the insights provided by the\neliminativist theories, he claims that imaginative and fictionality\nfailure arise when a work of fiction embeds a proposition that is\ninadequately and exhaustively grounded (2015: 12). G is\ninadequately grounded because we are on the lookout for a context that\ncan help us to make sense of the claim. G is exhaustively\ngrounded because no additional context can make it right. \nMismatch Theories\n\nAnother strand within cantian explanations of the phenomenon of\nimaginative resistance takes the inability on the side of the\nimaginers to result from a kind of a cognitive mismatch or conflict.\nJonathan M. Weinberg and Aaron Meskin offer a solution to the puzzle\nof imaginative resistance (or as they prefer to call it \u201cthe\npuzzle of imaginative blockage\u201d) on the basis of an empirically\ninformed cognitive model of imagination developed on the basis of\nShaun Nichols\u2019 and Stephen Stich\u2019s work on imagination\n(Nichols & Stich 2000, 2003a, 2003b; Nichols 2004). On this model,\nimaginative resistance arises from a conflict between different\ncognitive systems. As elements of our cognitive architecture, Weinberg\nand Meskin identify a belief-box (containing one\u2019s\ncurrent beliefs) and an imagination-box (containing\none\u2019s current imaginings) and the consistency between them is\nsecured by a mechanism called updater which updates\none\u2019s beliefs in the face of new information. Another mechanism\nis called inputter and it is in charge of putting any content\nwhatsoever in one\u2019s imagination box on the basis of one\u2019s\ndecision to do so. There are also domain-specific processes that\ninteract with both the belief-box and the imagination-box, such as\nmoral judgment system(s). In the case of imaginative resistance, a\nconflict arises between the inputter and the moral judgment system.\nUpon encountering the sentence G, while the inputter is putting\nG into the imagination-box, the moral judgment system imposes\nan independent moral judgment ~G on the basis of the relevant\ninformation provided by the work of fiction. This conflict is noticed\nby the updater and the newly added G is cancelled out.\nTherefore, G cannot be held in the imagination-box. \n\nTooming (2018), drawing on the insights provided by some of the\nwontian and eliminativist theories, differentiates between imagination\nand mere supposition (for an overview of other accounts that make this\ndistinction, see section 2.5 of the entry on\n imagination).\n On Tooming\u2019s picture, (engaged) imagination, unlike mere\nsupposition, requires mental imagery (2018: 690; see the entry on\n mental imagery\n and section 2.3 of the entry on\n imagination).\n Imagining the truth of a proposition in an engaged manner involves\nalso imagining \n\n\na fine-grained sensory array or various arrays that are meant to\ncorrespond to the way that the state of affairs represented by the\nproposition would appear to us. (2018: 691) \n\n\nFor instance, when we form a mental image of Giselda, we\nmight imagine Giselda\u2019s baby wrapped in a pink blanket being\nhanded to her by the nurse, the look on Giselda\u2019s face while\nkilling her baby, etc. But all these details are regulated by the\nproposition we are asked to imagine, namely G. For a unitary\nact of engaged imagining, Tooming posits that the mental imaginary and\nthe proposition must match up. In the cases of imaginative resistance,\nthey do not match. We cannot imagine G to be true because our\nmental imagery of G does not match the content of G. One\nof the distinguishing features of Tooming\u2019s cantian theory is\nthat it does not presuppose a realist conception of truth in fiction\nas others do (e.g., the dependency-violation theories of Walton,\nWeatherson, and Yablo). \n\nStock (2017) also proposes a version of mismatch cantianism. She\nargues that imaginative resistance arises in very particular pragmatic\ncontexts which contain invitations not to imagine per se but\nto counterfactually imagine. Invitations to counterfactually imagine\nusually involve narrators implying the appropriateness of\ncounterfactual beliefs about what would follow from some of the\ninitial premises in the work of fiction. Counterfactual imagining is a\ntool that narrators have used to make their audience take on new\nbeliefs: If the imaginers accept all the premises in the work of\nfiction they will arrive at a new belief, usually a new moral belief.\nStock gives the examples of \n\n\nmorally didactic fictions such as Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin,\nTo Kill a Mockingbird, or Dickens\u2019s Hard Times\n\n\n\nas works that \n\n\nexplicitly have the aim of inculcating certain moral beliefs in this\nway (roughly: if this\u2014indicating some scenario\u2014was real,\nit would be wrong). (2017: 129) \n\n\nThe resistance raises when an imaginer rejects the beliefs in\nquestions because they are in conflict with their antecedent beliefs.\nIn the Giselda case, one is not merely refusing to imagine\nthat G is true, but instead refusing to believe that G\nis true because they already believe ~G. The resistance arises\nbecause of a mismatch between one\u2019s antecedent beliefs and what\nthe narrator invites them to believe. \n2.1.2 Wontian theories\n\nWontian theories explain the phenomenon of imaginative resistance in\nterms of unwillingness or lack of desire on the side of the imaginer.\nDifferent versions of wontian theories have been proposed and they\ndiffer with respect to how they explain the cause of unwillingness.\n\n\nGendler (2000) develops the first contemporary version of a wontian\ntheory in response to what she perceives as intractable difficulties\nfacing cantian accounts. Focusing on dependency-violation cantian\ntheories, she conceives of these accounts as premised on the\nunimaginability of impossibilities. The reason we cannot imagine a\nproposition such as G is that it represents a conceptually\nimpossible state of affairs and the conceptual impossibility of that\nstate of affairs renders G unimaginable (Gendler 2000: 66 calls\nthis \u201cthe impossibility hypothesis\u201d; see Walton 2006: 145\nfor his rejection of Gendler\u2019s characterization of his account).\nGendler then argues that impossibilities are indeed imaginable because\nimagination does not require possibility but rather only\nconceivability. To demonstrate this, she concocts a story, The\nTower of Goldbach, where twelve turns out to both be and not be\nthe sum of five and seven (2000: 68, cf. Graham Priest\u2019s (1997)\nSylvan\u2019s Box, where Sylvan finds an empty box that\ncontains a statue). Even if we are asked to imagine something that is\nconceptually impossible, we can do so according to Gendler by\nexploiting our capacity for selective attention. By paying attention\nto different parts of the story at different times and ignoring others\nwe can ultimately succeed in imagining a conceptual impossibility.\nGiven that we can imagine what is conceptually impossible,\nsome further explanation is required as to why we resist imagining\nGiselda or Death on the Freeway. \n\nGendler limits her discussion to cases of imaginative resistance that\noccur within realist fictions (she calls them \u201cnon-distorting\nfictions\u201d (2000: 77)). When we read realist works of fiction, we\nfeel free to import real world facts into the world of fiction.\nIndeed, authors presuppose that, in line with the facts they\nexplicitly state, readers will bring in real world facts to fill in\nwhat is left unsaid in the story. For instance, while reading a\nrealist fiction, let\u2019s call it Doctors, about the\nintersecting lives of a group of doctors working at a San Francisco\nhospital, we might import various facts from our world into the\nfictional world of the story, such as the laws of physics, Northern\nCalifornian weather conditions, facts and norms about social\ninteraction, and so on. At the same time, we feel free to export\nfictional truths from Doctors that we believe not only hold\nin the fictional world of Doctors but also in the actual\nworld. Some of these truths can be added to our repertoire in the same\nway that knowledge by testimony is added. For instance, we can export\nmedical facts from the fiction such as the fact that Graves\u2019\ndisease can manifest itself as both hyperthyroidism and as an\ninflammation of the eyes, or that there is a likelihood that\none\u2019s thyroid can grow back even after a total thyroidectomy. We\nmight also export facts that we come to learn as a result of\nreflecting on Doctors. We can add such facts as that\nworkplace romances can get too complicated to our cognitive stock in\nthe same way that we add knowledge gained by modelling.\n\nIn encountering cases of imaginative resistance such as\nGiselda, we come to feel that it is not just part of the\nstory that the author wants us to imagine that G is true, but\nrather that the author actually endorses G (the doubling of the\nnarrator). In this regard, we cannot simply treat the Giselda\ncase like any other typical case of imagining. In the Giselda case, we\nfeel that we are being asked to export G into our world.\nGendler thinks that we are unwilling to engage in the imaginative\nactivity because in doing so we might export the morally deviant\noutlooks to the actual world, something we would naturally want to\navoid. She claims that the \n\n\ncases that evoke genuine imaginative resistance will be cases where\nthe reader feels that she is being asked to export a way of looking at\nthe actual world which she does not wish to add to her conceptual\nrepertoire. (2000: 77)\n\n\nHere again Gendler stresses that the wontian explanation she provides\nis premised on how imagination is distinct from mere supposition and\nbelief. The difference between them explains our general capacity to\nimagine morally deviant situations (because imagination is distinct\nfrom belief) and our general unwillingness to do so (because\nimagination is distinct from mere supposition) (2000: 81). \n\nGendler (2006) makes revisions to her earlier explanation of\nimaginative resistance by downplaying the role of desire and\naccentuating the role of principles governing the generation of\nfictional truth in works of fiction. \n\nGendler\u2019s wontianism focuses solely on the interactions between\ncognitive imagination and desire while other wontian theories shift\nthe focus towards the role of conative imagination. Gregory Currie\n(2002) differentiates between two modes of imagining, belief-like\n(cognitive) imagining and desire-like (conative) imagining. He claims\nthat imaginative resistance arises due to a lack of relevant\nantecedent desire that can ground one\u2019s desire-like imaginings.\nSome imaginings are belief-like with respect to their inferential\nrole: imagining that P can lead to new imaginings just as\nbelieving that P would lead to new beliefs. If one engages in\nbelief-like imagining some proposition P in the course of\nreading a story, then they accept P as true within the story\nand make the appropriate connections and inferences that having such a\nbelief requires. An example would be imagining that Don Quixote is\nfighting a windmill. Desire-like imaginings, on the other hand, are\nrather more constrained. Even though we do not seem to have any\nproblem belief-like imagining something we do not believe, we cannot\nas easily desire-like imagine something we do not desire. This is\nbecause desire-like imagining requires there to be an antecedent\ndesire. There are also internal connections between belief-like\nimaginings and desire-like imaginings when it comes to moral matters,\njust as there are internal connections between moral beliefs and\ndesires (e.g., believing that X is good also involves desiring\nX). In an imaginative resistance case such as Giselda,\nto belief-like imagine that G is true requires one to have a\ndesire-like imagining for female infanticide to occur. Since\none\u2019s desire-like imagining is conditioned by their antecedent\ndesires, to have a desire-like imagining that female infants should be\nkilled requires one to have an antecedent desire that female infants\nshould be killed. When one lacks such an antecedent desire, one\nexperiences imaginative resistance. \n\nDustin Stokes (2006) provides a version of wontianism that involves\nrevising Currie\u2019s account by giving the role played by\ndesire-like imaginings to what he calls \u201cvalue-like\nimaginings\u201d. By drawing on David Lewis\u2019 account of valuing\n(to value x is to desire that one desire x\u2014namely,\nto have a second-order desire for x), Stokes claims that\nvalue-like imagining involves imaginatively desiring to desire that\nthe world be in a certain way. Imaginative resistance arises for\ninstance in the case of Giselda, when we don\u2019t\nimaginatively desire that we desire for female infanticide to occur.\n\n\nJulia Driver (2008) proposes a solution to imaginative resistance that\nbuilds on the work done by Gendler and Weatherson. It would be\nincorrect to call it either a strict wontian or cantian account but\nultimately she explains resistance reactions in terms of psychological\nnecessity. She suggests that it is the psychological necessity of the\nclaims we take to be morally true that leads to the difficulties we\nexperience when we are invited to imagine their negations. In some\ncases the resistance is due to our unwillingness. In others, \n\n\nwe are not simply unwilling to entertain their negations,\nbut, rather, we do not now have the desires needed to do so.\n(2008: 312) \n\n2.1.3 Eliminativist theories\n\nEliminativist theories reject the notion that there is a puzzling\nphenomenon called imaginative resistance. They claim that what is\ndepicted by the cantian and the wontian theories alike is that\nsome people might experience some difficulties in\nengaging with some imaginative activities prompted by\nsome works of fiction. But there is nothing unique about this\nsituation. According to eliminativists, depending on one\u2019s own\ncontext and the context specified by the work, resistance reactions\nmight differ but there is nothing puzzling about this. \n\nStock (2005) focuses on the importance of context. She claims that the\nreason why we seem to fail to imagine G and fail to accept\nG as true is that we lack a proper context to make it true and\nimaginable. When such a context is provided, the resistance reaction\ndissipates. G, in the absence of such a context, is not\nconceptually coherent and that is why we cannot comprehend what\nG really means. Stock writes, \n\n\n[t]o demonstrate conceptual coherence for [G], the right sort\nof fictional context needs to be supplied: for instance, the\nconceptual coherence of [G] is demonstrated once one imagines\nthat in the town in which Giselda lives, girl children inevitably face\natrocious lives\u2014are placed into unspeakable slavery, for\ninstance\u2014if they are allowed to live. (2005: 617)\n\n\nShe claims that imaginative failure results from \u201cthe contingent\nincomprehensibility of the relevant proposition\u201d because one\ncannot think of a context that would make the proposition we are\nprompted to imagine true (2005: 608). The account has been criticized\nfor disregarding what Weatherson calls the \u201cThat\u2019s\nall\u201d clause that is implicitly embedded in works that trigger\nresistance (Weatherson 2004: 20). Of course, the addition of the life\nof slavery into the context may affect resistance reactions, but the\nwhole issue is that there is no such elaborate context supplied by the\nauthor. As long as no such context is implied or explicitly stated, we\nshould assume that there is nothing more to the Giselda story\nother than that Giselda did the right thing by killing her baby just\nbecause she was a girl. The question posed by the phenomenon of\nimaginative resistance is why we experience imagining Giselda\nin the way that we do given that we know that it is just fiction. (See\nNanay 2010, for an explanation of imaginative resistance as involving\nanother type of incomprehensibility. According to Nanay, resistance\narises because the narrator appears to the imaginer to be violating a\nmaxim akin to Grice\u2019s Cooperative Principle. This turns the\nimaginer\u2019s attention away from the fiction and towards its\nauthor, hence producing the doubling of the narrator effect discussed\nby Gendler (Nanay 2010: 591).) \n\nTodd points out that differences in the context of the fictional\nworks, as well as differences in our own context as imaginers,\ngenerate a range of possible resistance reactions to the same deviant\ncontents. Our own context, which is constituted partially by our\nfurther beliefs, commitments, and values, influences not only how we\ninterpret the proposition we are invited to imagine but also our\nevaluations. Todd claims that the strong reactions cantian theories\ndepict as the \u201cappropriate\u201d responses to scenarios such as\nGiselda or Death on the Freeway are far-fetched and\nthat only those who share cantians\u2019 realist commitments when it\ncomes to morality or truth in fiction would react in those ways.\nFurthermore, not all moral violations are on a par: Thick moral\nconcepts, as opposed to thin ones, require stronger descriptive and\nevaluative conditions. The context specified by the work and our\ninterpretative context themselves might also have effects on how we\ninterpret the thickness of concepts. Todd concludes, \n\n\n[f]or, although psychologically interesting, it appears to be a\n\u2018natural\u2019 and entirely un-puzzling feature of imagination\nthat it should be so relative; where by \u2018natural\u2019 is meant\nmerely that imagining just is a capacity that is subject to degree,\nand dependent on and relative to a range of further beliefs,\ncommitments, values and so on. (2009: 198)\n\n\nThe variety of resistance reactions due to the context of the fiction\nas well as the imaginer\u2019s own context leads eliminativists to\ndismiss the phenomenon of imaginative resistance as a genuine\nphenomenon (see Tanner 1994 and Mothersill 2003 for other defenses of\neliminativism). However, their insights concerning context relativity\nhave led to further research on imaginative resistance (more on that\nin\n section 2.3).\n2.2 The Object of Resistance\n\nAnother point of contention within imaginative resistance research\nconcerns the object of resistance. What is involved in our resisting\nto engage with a fictional work? So far we have seen various accounts\nthat attempt to give explanations of imaginative resistance while\nassuming that what is resisted is propositional content. There are\nother options. According to Moran (1994), our engagement with works of\nfiction cannot be reduced merely to imagining propositional contents\nbut also includes interpretive and emotional responses to fiction. In\npoint of fact, the content of our engagement is largely\nnon-propositional. He rejects the clear-cut distinction between the\nactual and the fictional and claims that our interpretative and\nemotional responses to fiction are actual rather than imagined. Moran\ndistinguishes between hypothetical and dramatic imagination (1994:\n104\u20135). Hypothetical imagining involves seeing what would follow\nfrom a propositional content you are given, entertaining the\nassumption of its truth. Dramatic imagining or imagining with respect\nto emotional attitudes involves trying on a perspective, a dramatic\nrehearsal so to speak. The phenomenon of imaginative resistance\ninvolves both kinds of imagining. A resistance triggering scenario\nwould do so because (1) we have difficulties entertaining the\nassumption of its truth because the storyline does not add up and (2)\nwe have difficulties inhabiting the perspective because it is alien to\nus. \n\nOne of the problems with Moran\u2019s account is that it is not clear\nhow we can account for what Elizabeth Camp (2017) calls\n\u201cdisparate response\u201d. Disparate response refers to \n\n\nreaders\u2019 ability and willingness to alter their emotional, moral\nand other evaluative responses from those they would have to the same\nsituation in real life. (2017: 73) \n\n\nSince Moran challenges the strict actual/fictional divide, he seems to\nrun into a problem when it comes to explaining disparate response.\nCamp (2017), drawing on Moran\u2019s work, presents a unified\nexplanation of both imaginative resistance and disparate responses by\nappealing to perspectives. She defines perspective as \n\n\nan open-ended disposition to notice, explain, and respond to\nsituations in the world \u2014 an ability to \u201cgo on the same\nway\u201d in assimilating and responding to whatever information and\nexperiences one encounters. (2017: 78) \n\n\nEngaging with works of fiction involves taking on perspectives that\nare prescribed by the narrators. That is how non-propositional content\nis communicated to audiences. In cases of imaginative resistance, what\nwe resist is taking on alien perspectives. Our resistance might be\ncaused by various types of inconsistencies embedded in the work or we\nmight resist on prudential, moral, or aesthetic grounds. One important\naspect of Camp\u2019s theory is that these resistance reactions are\nnot always voluntary (2017: 92\u20133). She also argues that her\naccount has an advantage over competing theories because she does not\nreduce the content of imaginings to propositional content. (See also\nGoldie 2003, for a similar explanation of imaginative resistance.)\n2.3 The Scope of Resistance\n\nThe proposals put forward by cantians, wontians, and eliminativists\nhave reshaped the scope of imaginative resistance. Its scope has been\nboth narrowed down and expanded in different respects. \n2.3.1 Inclusivity\n\nCantian theories have opened up a theoretical space in which to\nquestion the assumed asymmetry between the imaginability of morally\nand nonmorally deviant content. Given that\ndependence/supervenience/virtue relations also hold between different\nkinds of higher-level and lower-level properties or facts other than\nmoral kinds, violations of these relations can trigger resistance as\nwell. Therefore, our list of resistance-triggering claims should be\nmore inclusive and include not only counter-evaluative claims but also\ncounter-descriptive claims (inclusivity thesis). Kendall Walton (1994)\nclaims that other kinds of normative deviances such as aesthetic\ndeviance can also trigger resistance. Imagine that a comedian in a\nstory tells a dumb knock knock joke (e.g., \u201cKnock, knock\u201d.\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d \u201cCow says\u201d. \u201cCow\nsays who?\u201d \u201cNo, a cow says mooooo!\u201d) No matter how\nmuch effort the author thereafter expends, we would not be persuaded\nof its hilarity. \n\nYablo (2002) argues that imaginative resistance arises due to deviant\nuse of response-dependent descriptive concepts, such as shape. We\nmight thereby experience resistance when we are asked to imagine the\nbeauty and elegance of a monster truck competition or that the\nfive-fingered maple leaf that Sally is holding is oval. Weatherson\n(2004) goes even further to claim that, alongside deviant attribution\nof thick moral concepts and deviant evaluative sentences, other\ntriggers of imaginative resistance include sentences expressing\ndeviant epistemic evaluations, attributions of mental states,\nattributions of mental or linguistic content, deviant use of some\nshape predicates, some deviant ontological claims, and deviant claims\nabout constitution. For instance, according to Weatherson, we cannot\nimagine, in an alternative Quixote story of his own concoction, that\nQuixote\u2019s favorite item of furniture is a television which is\nfor all intents and purposes indistinguishable from a common knife.\nWhat counts as a television is tied to certain functional roles and\nthese roles are missing in the story. (See Barnes & Black 2016 and\nKim, Kneer, & Stuart 2019 for empirical studies that examine\nwhether the type of the deviant claim\u2014its being\ncounter-evaluative or counter-descriptive\u2014makes a difference in\nresistance reactions. On the basis of their studies, Black and Barnes\ncome to the conclusion that the type of the claim makes vast\nindividual differences between resistance reactions, while Kim et al.\nconclude that \u201cimaginative resistance depends on the weirdness\nof content, not whether the claim is evaluative or descriptive\u201d\n(2019: 160).)\n\nAnna Mahtani (2012) questions whether it is the case that imaginative\nresistance only arises in situations that involve conflict between\nsome fictional proposition and what we believe to be the case.\nJustifications of female infanticide, slavery, or genocide\nnon-controversially are in conflict with our moral norms. Mahtani\nargues against the notion that conflict is a necessary element of\nimaginative resistance by claiming that there are cases which (i)\ngenerate imaginative resistance and (ii) are not properly\ncharacterizable as involving a conflict between an utterance in the\nfiction and the reader\u2019s beliefs. She gives the example of a\nstory involving a character named Lucy who performs a morally\nambiguous action (2012: 419). Mahtani claims that the author\u2019s\npronouncement of the rightness of this morally ambiguous action will\nbe met with resistance, even though the author\u2019s claim does not\ndirectly conflict with our beliefs regarding Lucy\u2019s action. \n2.3.2 Genre\n\nOne of the main contributions of eliminativist accounts to discussions\nregarding the scope of imaginative resistance comes from their\ninsistence on the importance of context. When this insight is combined\nwith Gendler\u2019s (2000) emphasis on the importance of the realist\ngenre, the result has been a proliferation of accounts defending the\nrelevance of genre in determining the quantitative differences between\npeople\u2019s resistance reactions (Weinberg 2008, Nanay 2010, Liao\net al. 2014, Liao 2016). The main idea is that our reactions to the\nsame moral deviation, let\u2019s say female infanticide, can differ\ndepending on the genre of the work in which they occur. One might take\nplace in the context of an Aztec or a Greek myth, or science-fiction,\nand the other might take place in the context of a realist fiction.\nLiao et al. (2014) conducted two empirical studies to put this idea to\nthe test and demonstrate that genre is salient in explaining\nresistance reactions and variations. On the basis of their Study 1,\nthey concluded that lack of genre competence strongly correlates with\ncomparative difficulties in imagining a morally deviant proposition\nand accepting it as true. On the basis of their Study 2, they\nconcluded that genre manipulation can lead to variation in the\nresistance reactions triggered by the same proposition. (See Phelan\n2017 in\n Other Internet Resources\n for a replication of the studies; see Black et al. 2018 for a study\nthat examines the salience of genre familiarity to resistance\nreactions.) \n\nIn his 2016 article, Liao expands on the results of this previous\ncollaborative research and paper. He claims that the empirical studies\nshow that genre conventions limit the types of propositions that can\nappear within the context of a work, so the fictionality puzzle arises\ndue to genre convention-discordant propositions (2016; 474). He adds\nthat each genre convention is associated with different expectations\nas to what kind of propositions can appear within this genre (2016:\n471). Therefore, the imaginability puzzle arises because we find it\ncomparatively difficult to imagine genre expectation-discordant\npropositions. For instance, in a realistic fiction, we expect all the\npropositions to be in compliance with our real-world moral norms. This\nexpectation does not apply if the work is an Aztec myth or a Greek\ntragedy.\n2.3.3 Bias\n\nAnother ripple effect of eliminativists\u2019 theories, particularly\nTodd\u2019s theory, has been the focus on the importance of the\nimaginer\u2019s own context for generating variations in imaginative\nresistance reactions. Adriana Clavel-Vazquez (2018) discusses a\nspecial kind of imaginative resistance case which makes it clear that\nit is not only the context of the fictional work (its genre) that has\neffects on our engagement but also our own context as well. The case\nshe discusses involves rough heroines. \n\nRough heroes are deeply morally flawed protagonists that demand\nappreciators\u2019 allegiance. We owe the term \u201crough\nheroes\u201d to David Hume (1757 [1875: 322]); however it is Anne\nEaton who gives us the list of conditions for being a rough hero\n(2012: 281\u2013292). Clavel-Vazquez improves on Eaton\u2019s list\n(2018: 203): \n\nhis moral flaws are grievous, \nhis flaws are an integral part of his personality,\nthe rough hero intentionally engages in immoral actions and his\nremorse is not a central part of the narrative,\nthe audience is not prescribed to forgive him or dismiss his\nactions as the result of misfortune, weakness, or ignorance,\nhis vices are not outweighed by other morally relevant features.\n\n\n\nSome examples given of rough heroes are Breaking Bad\u2019s\nWalter White and Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs. The\ninteresting aspect of rough heroes is that even though they have all\nthese negative characteristics, we still end up aligning ourselves\nwith them due to pro-attitudes prescribed by the narrative despite the\ninitial resistance we feel. Indeed, the created tension is necessary\nfor proper appreciation: the tension between condemning the hero due\nto his moral flaws and developing pro-attitudes towards the hero due\nto narrative encouragement eventually leads to overcoming our initial\nresistance to the hero and to aligning ourselves with him. Eaton\nconsiders this created tension and the subsequent overcoming of the\ntension to be the narrative\u2019s artistic achievement (2012: 285).\n\n\nClavel-Vazquez argues that there exists an asymmetry between rough\nheroes and rough heroines (she calls this the \u201caffective\npuzzle\u201d). In the case of the rough heroines, it is less likely\nfor us to overcome our resistance. Indeed, the almost nonexistence of\nrough heroines, she claims, attests to that fact. The narrative does\nnot seem to have equal success when it comes to rough heroines, and\nthis might be the narrative\u2019s fault. We have various examples of\nalmost-workable rough heroines, such as Amy Dunne in Gone\nGirl, Claire Underwood in House of Cards, and so on. But\nwe are either not able to feel allegiance with them, or they are not\nas ethically transgressive as their male counterparts. (One exception\nseems to be Villanelle in Killing Eve so far.) Clavel-Vazquez\nargues that we resist aligning ourselves with rough heroines because\nin being morally transgressive they break with gender norms and\nexpectations. Our sexist biases affect our resistance reactions.\nAccording to her, this means that when we examine the cause of\nimaginative resistance, we need to keep in mind our own interpretative\nhorizons, which are shaped by our sociocultural context. \n\nThe existence of variation in imaginative resistance reactions led the\neliminativists to conclude that imaginative resistance is not a\ngenuine phenomenon. Starting with a second wave of research on\nimaginative resistance (around 2010), variation is taken to be\nsomething that can be accounted for (see Gendler and Liao 2016 for the\nfirst and second wave distinction). According to some, it should be\naccounted for by an all-encompassing theory (e.g., Peterson 2019), and\naccording to others it should be addressed by adopting explanatory\npluralism (e.g., Liao et al. 2014). This variation-sensitivity has\nsince been one of the general themes in imaginative resistance\nresearch and one of the influences responsible for the proliferation\nof empirical research in the field. (See Black and Barnes 2017 for a\npsychological study that aims to show that there are different\ninfluences on our resistance reactions, such as disgust\nsensitivity.)\n3. Imagination\n\nThe use of the word \u201cimaginative\u201d in \u201cimaginative\nresistance\u201d has been criticized for disregarding the fact that\nnot all resistance reactions are related to the imagination and it has\nbeen suggested that perhaps imagination might have nothing to do with\nthe resistance reactions. One of the debates on imaginative resistance\nhas dealt with whether imaginative resistance cases put constraints on\nour cognitive imagination (belief-like imagining) or conative\nimagination (desire-like imagining), or fail to put any constraints on\nthe imagination at all (see sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the entry on\n imagination\n for explanations of the relation between imagination and belief, on\nthe one hand, and the relation between imagination and desire, on the\nother). It is possible to regroup some of the theories of imaginative\nresistance that have been covered in\n Section 2,\n alongside other theories, with respect to this debate. \n\nMiyazono and Liao (2016) take on this task and provide a detailed\ntaxonomy of the positions in the imaginative resistance literature\nwith respect to what psychological components of the human mind they\ntake to be necessary for explaining imaginative resistance. The\ntheories can be divided into three main groups: cognitive imagination\ntheories, conative imagination theories, and no-imagination\ntheories.\n3.1 Imagination Theories\n\nAccording to cognitive imagination theories, imaginative resistance\nreactions reflect either our inability or unwillingness to take on\nbelief-like imaginings. We might not be able to take on the imaginings\nbecause cognitive imaginings are processed by the same system that is\nin charge of processing similar beliefs (see Nichols 2004, 2006a;\nWeinberg & Meskin 2006). Or we might not be able to cognitively\nimagine higher-level claims in the absence of support from lower-level\nfacts because such belief-like imaginings are possible only when they\nreceive adequate lower-level support as ordinary beliefs do (see\nWalton 1994, 2006; Weatherson 2004; Stear 2015). Or we might be unable\nor unwilling to take on the belief-like imaginings because we do not\nwant to export them or believe them given a conflicting belief we hold\nor our lack of trust for the narrator (Gendler 2000, 2006; Matravers\n2003; Stock 2017). \n\nAccording to conative imagination theories, we cannot desire-like or\nvalue-like imagine what we are asked to because we lack the necessary\ndesire or second-order desire to do so (see Currie 2002 and Stokes\n2006). \n3.2 No-Imagination Theories\n\nNo-imagination theories appeal neither to cognitive imagination nor to\nconative imagination in their explanations of the mechanism(s)\ninvolved in the resistance reactions. \n\nGendler (2008a, 2008b) claims that alief, which she proposes as an\ninnate propensity to automatically respond to a real or apparent\nstimulus, is what is responsible for resistance reactions, not\nimagination (for more on alief, see section 3.3 of the entry on\n imagination).\n Alief is more primitive and fundamental than cognitive or conative\nimagination. It is responsible for generating a resistance response to\nprompted imaginings due to the perceived (perhaps unconsciously\nperceived or registered) possibility of contagion. \n\nAnother explanation of imaginative resistance that locates the source\nof resistance reactions somewhere other than the imagination puts\nemotions center stage. Ronald de Sousa (2010) claims that what is\ngoing on in resistance cases is not that we are unable to make sense\nof the content of the imagined situation but that we fail to\nexperience certain emotional responses or fail to respond altogether\nto certain imagined prospects. For instance, Giselda\nengenders moral repulsion on the side of the imaginer while\nprescribing that they feel moral allegiance or approval. The\nknock-knock joke, on the other hand, fails to engender amusement while\nthe author insists that we find it hilarious.\n4. Conclusion\n\nAs we have seen, in \u201cthe puzzle of imaginative resistance\u201d\nso far only the word \u201cof\u201d has been uncontentious. However,\nthis should not be taken as a sign of impasse. Instead of engendering\nconfusion and disorientation, the liveliness of the debate points to\nthe richness of the topic and openings for new fronts in imaginative\nresistance research. This area of inquiry is still in its early stages\nand further research is needed on all of the topics discussed above.\nSome of most pressing research questions include: Are there\nungrounded/unjustified imaginative resistance reactions? How can one\novercome ungrounded/unjustified imaginative resistance reactions? How\ncan we revise the extant theories to account for variation in\nresistance reactions and diversity of resistance-triggering claims?\nThere is much more we can gather from further empirical research on\nthe topic, and there is plenty of opportunity for further research on\nthe broader implications imaginative resistance has for fields such as\nmoral psychology, aesthetic psychology, cognitive architecture,\nsemantics and pragmatics of evaluative terms, modal epistemology, and\nso on (building on the work of scholars such as Levy 2005, Driver\n2008, Levin 2012).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Barnes, Jennifer and Jessica E.
