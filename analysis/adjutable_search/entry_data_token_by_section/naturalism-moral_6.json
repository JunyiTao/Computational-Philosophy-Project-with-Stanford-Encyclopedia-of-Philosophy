    "main_text": "Why be a Moral Naturalist? || Arguments from Anti-Skepticism\n3.2 Arguments from Anti-Skepticism\n\nA second family of arguments for naturalism are epistemic. Scientific\nmethods (broadly construed) are very powerful tools for coming to have\nknowledge of the world so, if moral facts are the kinds of facts that\nwe can know about by scientific methods, then we have powerful tools\nfor obtaining moral knowledge. Non-naturalists, by contrast, say that\nwe know about moral facts via non-empirical methods, typically\nintuition. This seems like a much less firm footing for our moral\nknowledge than the scientific method. This is controversial, of\ncourse. Intuitionist moral epistemology is popular (Huemer 2005;\nChudnoff 2013; Bengson, Cuneo, and Shafer-Landau 2020). And it\u2019s\nnot clear how we can use empirical methods to learn about moral facts\n(although we\u2019ll look at some proposals in Sections 5\u20137)\n(Shafer-Landau 2003, Ch 3). But it\u2019s widely believed that moral\nnaturalists have an easier time answering moral skeptics than\nnon-naturalists, and that\u2019s a reason to be a moral\nnaturalist.\n\nLet\u2019s sharpen this point by looking at one influential family of\nskeptical challenges: explanationist challenges. Explanationist\nchallenges begin from the premise that our moral beliefs are explained\nby something other than the moral facts. What else? Different versions\nof the explanationist challenge focus on different things. According\nto the traditional version of the challenge from Gilbert Harman, our\nmoral beliefs are explained by our personal psychological attitudes\n(Harman 1977, Ch 1). Other versions of the explanationist challenge\nfocus on more distant causes of our moral beliefs. Disagreement\narguments note that moral beliefs tend to cluster along cultural\nlines, which suggests that our moral beliefs are explained by cultural\npressures (Mackie 1977, 37). Evolutionary debunking arguments posit\nthat our moral beliefs are ultimately explained by evolutionary\npressures (Joyce 2006; Street 2006). The common thought is that our\nmoral beliefs are not explained by the moral facts; they\u2019re\nexplained by a tangle of other naturalistic factors. Exactly why this\nwould lead to a skeptical conclusion is controversial, but many\nphilosophers think that explanationist challenges make a strong case\nfor skepticism. (For critical discussion, see, e.g., Enoch 2009;\nFitzPatrick 2015; Vavova 2015; Schechter 2017).\n\nNaturalists have an easy way to answer explanationist challenges. The\nnaturalist claims our moral beliefs are indeed explained by a tangle\nof naturalist facts, but they hold that some of those natural facts\nare the moral facts. For instance, Sturgeon argues that we think\nHitler was evil because Hitler was evil. Hitler\u2019s evil is a\nnatural feature of his character, and that feature both explains why\nHitler did the things that he did and why we judge him harshly as a\nresult (Sturgeon 1988). Similarly, David Copp argues that to be good\njust is to be conducive to social cooperation. So when the\nevolutionary debunker claims that we are naturally inclined, by\nevolution, to think that things which are conducive to social\ncooperation are good, this just amounts to the observation that we\njudge that things are good because they\u2019re good (Copp 2008).\nThis is a compelling enough response that many advocates of\nexplanationist challenges construe them as challenges for\nnon-naturalists, but not for naturalists (Joyce 2006; Bedke 2009; Lutz\n2018).\n",
