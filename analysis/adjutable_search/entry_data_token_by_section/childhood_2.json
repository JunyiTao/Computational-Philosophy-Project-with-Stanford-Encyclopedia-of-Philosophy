    "main_text": "Theories of Moral Development\n3. Theories of Moral Development\n\nMany philosophers in the history of ethics have devoted serious\nattention to the issue of moral development. Thus Plato, for example,\noffers a model curriculum in his dialogue, Republic, aimed at\ndeveloping virtue in rulers. Aristotle\u2019s account of the logical\nstructure of the virtues in his Nicomachean Ethics provides a\nscaffolding for understanding how moral development takes place. And\nthe Stoics (Turner and Matthews, 1998, 45\u201364) devoted special\nattention to dynamics of moral development.\n\nAmong modern philosophers, it is again Rousseau (1762) who devotes the\nmost attention to issues of development. He offers a sequence of five\nage-related stages through which a person must pass to reach moral\nmaturity: (i) infancy (birth to age 2); (ii) the age of sensation (3\nto 12); (iii) the age of ideas (13 to puberty); (iv) the age of\nsentiment (puberty to age 20); and (v) the age of marriage and social\nresponsibility (age 21 on). Although he allows that an adult may\neffectively modify the behavior of children by explaining that bad\nactions are those that will bring punishment (1762 [1979, 90]), he\ninsists that genuinely moral reasoning will not be appreciated until\nthe age of ideas, at 13 and older. In keeping with his stage theory of\nmoral development he explicitly rejects Locke\u2019s maxim,\n\u2018Reason with children\u2019 (Locke, JLE), on the ground that\nattempting to reason with a child younger than thirteen years of age\nis developmentally inappropriate.\n\nHowever, the cognitive theory of moral development formulated by\nPiaget in The Moral Judgment of the Child (1965) and the\nsomewhat later theory of Lawrence Kohlberg (1981, 1984) are the ones\nthat have had most influence on psychologists, educators, and even\nphilosophers. Thus, for example, what John Rawls has to say about\nchildren in his classic work, A Theory of Justice (1971)\nrests heavily on the work of Piaget and Kohlberg.\n\nKohlberg presents a theory according to which morality develops in\napproximately six stages, though according to his research, few adults\nactually reach the fifth or sixth stages. In this respect\nKohlberg\u2019s theory departs from classic stage theory, as in\nPiaget, since the sequence of stages does not culminate in the\ncapacity shared by normal adults. However, Kohlberg maintained that no\none skips a stage or regresses to an earlier stage. Although Kohlberg\nsometimes considered the possibility of a seventh or eighth stage,\nthese are his basic six: the premoral (the 1st involving punishment\nand obedience, and the 2nd naive hedonism), the morality of\nconventional role conformity (the 3rd involving seeking good\nrelations, the 4th maintaining authority) and the morality of accepted\nprinciples (the 5th involving the morality of contract, individual\nrights and accepted law, the 6th individual principles of conscience).\n\n\nKohlberg developed a test, which has been widely used, to determine\nthe stage of any individual at any given time. The test requires\nresponses to ethical dilemmas and is to be scored by consulting an\nelaborate manual.\n\nOne of the most influential critiques of the Kohlberg theory is to be\nfound in Carol Gilligan\u2019s In a Different Voice (1982).\nGilligan argues that Kohlberg\u2019s rule-oriented conception of\nmorality has an orientation toward justice, which she associates with\nstereotypically male thinking, whereas women and girls are perhaps\nmore likely to approach moral dilemmas with a \u201ccare\u201d\norientation. One important issue in moral theory that the\nKohlberg-Gilligan debate raises is that of the role and importance of\nmoral feelings in the moral life (see the entry on\n feminist ethics).\n\nAnother line of approach to moral development is to be found in the\nwork of Martin Hoffman (1982). Hoffman describes the development of\nempathetic feelings and responses in four stages. Hoffman\u2019s\napproach allows one to appreciate the possibility of genuine moral\nfeelings, and so of genuine moral agency, in a very small child. By\ncontrast, Kohlberg\u2019s moral-dilemma tests will assign\npre-schoolers and even early elementary-school children to a pre-moral\nlevel.\n\nA philosophically astute and balanced assessment of the\nKohlberg-Gilligan debate, with appropriate attention to the work of\nMartin Hoffman, can be found in Pritchard (1991). See also Friedman\n(1987), Likona (1976), Kagan and Lamb (1987), and Pritchard\n(1996).\n\nWhile much of the discussion of children\u2019s moral development has\noccurred within psychology, some recent philosophical work on the\ntopic has emerged, with a particular focus on questions about whether\nchildren can be held resposible for either or both of morally\npraiseworthy actions and those that would be considered morally\nblameworthy if performed by adults (Burroughs 2020, Tiboris 2014).\n",
