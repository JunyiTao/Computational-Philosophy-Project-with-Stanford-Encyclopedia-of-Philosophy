    "main_text": "Humboldt\u2019s Life || A Linguistic Turn in Paris\n1.3 A Linguistic Turn in Paris\n\nDuring his Parisian sojourn Humboldt met and had contact with the\nforemost French politicians, scholars and intellectuals of the period\nsuch as Siey\u00e8s, Tracy, Roederer, Garat, Cabanis,\nDeg\u00e9rando, La Romigui\u00e8re, Dupont de Nemours, Benjamin\nConstant and Madame de Sta\u00ebl whose literary salon he frequented.\nHe attended meetings of the Institut National (as the\nAcademie Fran\u00e7aise was called then) and debated\nKantian philosophy with the leading French philosophers (GS Vol 14:\n483\u201387), visited the theater regularly, and from a cultural\nanthropologist\u2019s point of view, he observed and analyzed its different\nforms and varieties from the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise\nand the Th\u00e9atre de la R\u00e9publique to the\nVaudeville. Meanwhile he studied and commented upon\neffectively the entire canon of classical and modern,\u2014i.e.,\neighteenth century\u2014French literature and philosophy, for example\nRousseau, Diderot and Madame de Sta\u00ebl. His comments on these\nwriters and his astute critique of the philosophy of Condillac and his\nfollowers found in his Parisian diaries offer important clues for an\nunderstanding of his own philosophical position. Goethe meanwhile\npublished two essays by him on French theater and art in his journal\nDie Propyl\u00e4en. Humboldt\u2019s Parisian diaries reveal the\nextraordinary scope and intensity of his involvement with the complex\ncultural, social, political and cultural life-world of France under\nthe Directoire (GS Vol 14: 361\u2013643; Vol 15:\n 1\u201346).[1]\n\nIn Paris, Humboldt completed his major work on aesthetics, his\nAesthetische Versuche I. Ueber Goethes Herrman und Dorothea\n(Essays in Aesthetics I. On Goethe\u2019s Herrmann und Dorothea)\nin 1799. In the same year he also published in French for the benefit\nof Madame de Sta\u00ebl and her circle a concise summary of its major\narguments with emphasis on his new theory of the imagination in the\nParisian journal Magasin Encyclop\u00e9dique. A decisive\nturning point in his intellectual career occurred with his discovery\nand pioneering investigations of the Basque language, an idiom whose\norigin and structure had defied hitherto all attempts at an\nexplanation by historians, philosophers and linguists following\nconventional methodologies. He disproved all existing theories about\nits descent and affiliation but instead of advancing new theories he\ndecided first to set out to study the language itself using all\npossible means at his disposal, from written documents, native\ninformants, statistics, historical, ethnological and sociological\ninformation to inventing and actually conducting what is known today\nas \u201cfield work\u201d. His Basque studies coincided with his\nformulation of a new conception of language questioning and defying\nthe representational view of language that had been dominant in\nWestern thinking from Aristotle all the way to the empiricist and\nrationalist thinkers of his day. This new conception would find its\nexpression in Humboldt\u2019s philosophy of language and linguistics that\nfrom this moment on became of central concern to him.\n",
