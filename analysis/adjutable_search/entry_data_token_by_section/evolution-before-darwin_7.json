    "main_text": "Buffon\u2019s Transformation of Enlightenment Natural History || Buffon and the Methodology of Natural History\n3.1 Buffon and the Methodology of Natural History\n\nBuffon\u2019s development of a broad theoretical inquiry into natural\nhistory within the framework of a state-sponsored institutional\nstructure warrants the special attention given here to his\ncontribution in the history of evolutionary theory. These included:\n(1) his methodological revolution in the epistemology of the\nnatural-historical sciences; (2) his analysis and proposed solution to\nthe problem of animal and plant generation; (3) his\nreconceptualization of the concept of biological species; (4) his bio-\ngeographical approach to the issues of animal distribution and\nvariation; (5) his renewed theoretical attention to issues of\ncosmology and the \u201ctheory of the earth;\u201d and finally (6),\nhis concluding synthesis of earth and life history in the grand\nnaturalistic account published as his monumental Les\n(originally Des) \u00c9poques de la Nature\n(Epochs of Nature) of 1778\u20139, which provided a model\nfor similar syntheses of the nineteenth century. Through this\ncombination of several lines of earlier inquiry, Buffon posed a series\nof theoretical questions that were further explored by important\nsuccessors associated with the Paris Museum in the nineteenth century\nand by natural historians of the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncentury more generally.\n\nIn his position as a natural philosopher, in dialogue with the works\nof Newton, Descartes, Leibniz, Clairaut, Du Ch\u00e2telet, the French\nEncyclopedists, and major English philosophers of his period,\nBuffon explored foundational methodological and philosophical\nquestions of the Enlightenment in combination with his analysis of\nempirical questions. One expression of this wider vision was the\nunusual way in which he sought to validate the inquiry into natural\nhistory in relation to a naturalized epistemology that scholars have\nseen as novel for its time (Hoquet 2005; Sloan 2006b; Roger 1997a,\nchp. 9, 1997b, chp. 6). In developing a new methodological approach to\nnatural history, Buffon claimed to ground his arguments on a form of\nempirical certitude\u2014\u201cphysical truth\u201d\n[verit\u00e9 physique]\u2014attained through inquiries\ninto the concrete relations of beings in their material relations.\nThis he opposed to the \u201cabstractions\u201d of mathematical\nphysics, extending the Leibnizian-inspired critique of Newtonian\nmethodology as developed in \u00c9milie Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s\n(1706\u20131749) Institutions de Physique, a work Buffon is\nknown to have read and admired as he made his transition into his\ncareer in natural history (Ch\u00e2telet, 1740). Developing this\nargument in a long \u201cDiscourse on Method\u201d that opened the\nfirst volume of his Histoire naturelle, g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et\nparticuli\u00e8re, avec la description du cabinet du roi\n(Buffon [HN]) (1749), Buffon argued that a science based on repeated\nobservation of concrete material relations of bodies can achieve a\ndegree of epistemic certitude which surpasses that available from the\nmathematical analysis of nature (Hoquet 2005; Grene & Depew 2004;\nRoger 1997a, chp. 6; Sloan 2006b). On the basis of this novel\nepistemological framework, oriented to the search for\n\u201cphysical\u201d truth, Buffon thus directed natural history\naway from a primarily classificatory project. The latter project,\nexemplified by the work of his contemporary Linnaeus, Buffon\ncriticized for imposing \u201cabstract\u201d categories on nature.\nIn its place, Buffon sought to analyze living beings in relation to\ntheir material conditions of existence. This was to be focused on\ntheir reproductive relationships, biogeographical distribution, and in\nhis later work, on their connections to cosmology and historical\ngeology.\n\nThese insights formed an epistemological framework for the subsequent\ndevelopment of the Histoire naturelle. In these discussions\nBuffon dealt both with issues in the foundational epistemology and\nmethodology of the natural-historical sciences as well as with the\ngeneralities and specifics of organic beings. Although the work was\noriginally intended as a survey of the entire range of animals,\nplants, and minerals, in its actual realization, it was more limited.\nThe first series of fourteen volumes (Buffon HN) appeared between 1749\nand 1767 and dealt with the genesis of the solar system and the earth,\nthe generation of animals, the varieties of the human species, and the\nnatural history of the primary quadrupeds and apes. The main quadruped\nvolumes of the first series, beginning in 1753, were written in\ncollaboration with the comparative anatomist Marie-Louis Daubenton\n(1716\u20131800). A series of seven volumes of Supplements\n(1774\u201389) offered additional reflections and additions to these\narticles and expanded on his views on the history of the earth, the\nquadrupeds, and anthropology. These also reported on experiments on\nthe strength of wood and the cooling of metals that he applied to\ndating the age of the earth. In the fifth supplementary volume (1778),\nBuffon presented his grand synthesis of cosmology, earth history, and\nthe history of life, the \u00c9poques de la nature (English\ntrans., Zalasiewicz et. al, 2018) (see below, 3.3). An additional five\nvolumes (1783\u201388) dealt with issues of mineralogy, chemistry,\nfire, and the main forces of nature, especially electricity and\nmagnetism.\n",
