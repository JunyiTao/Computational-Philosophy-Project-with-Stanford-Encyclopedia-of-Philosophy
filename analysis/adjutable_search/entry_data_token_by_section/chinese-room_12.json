    "main_text": "The Larger Philosophical Issues || Intentionality\n5.2 Intentionality\n\nIntentionality\n is the property of being about something, having content. In the 19th\nCentury, psychologist Franz Brentano re-introduced this term from\nMedieval philosophy and held that intentionality was the \u201cmark\nof the mental\u201d. Beliefs and desires are intentional states: they\nhave propositional content (one believes that p, one desires\nthat p, where sentences that represent propositions substitute\nfor \u201cp\u201d). Searle\u2019s views regarding\nintentionality are complex; of relevance here is that he makes a\ndistinction between the original or intrinsic intentionality of\ngenuine mental states, and the derived intentionality of language. A\nwritten or spoken sentence only has derivative intentionality insofar\nas it is interpreted by someone. It appears that on Searle\u2019s\nview, original intentionality can at least potentially be conscious.\nSearle then argues that the distinction between original and derived\nintentionality applies to computers. We can interpret the states of a\ncomputer as having content, but the states themselves do not have\noriginal intentionality. Many philosophers endorse this intentionality\ndualism, including Sayre (1986) and even Fodor (2009), despite\nFodor\u2019s many differences with Searle.\n\nIn a section of her 1988 book, Computer Models of the Mind,\nMargaret Boden notes that intentionality is not well-understood\n\u2013 reason to not put too much weight on arguments that turn on\nintentionality. Furthermore, insofar as we understand the brain, we\nfocus on informational functions, not unspecified causal powers of the\nbrain: \u201c\u2026from the psychological point of view, it is not\nthe biochemistry as such which matters but the information-bearing\nfunctions grounded in it.\u201d (241) Searle sees intentionality as a\ncausal power of the brain, uniquely produced by biological processes.\nDale Jacquette 1989 argues against a reduction of intentionality\n\u2013 intentionality, he says, is an \u201cineliminable,\nirreducible primitive concept.\u201d However most AI sympathizers\nhave seen intentionality, aboutness, as bound up with information, and\nnon-biological states can bear information as well as can brain\nstates. Hence many responders to Searle have argued that he displays\nsubstance chauvinism, in holding that brains understand but systems\nmade of silicon with comparable information processing capabilities\ncannot, even in principle. Papers on both sides of the issue appeared,\nsuch as J. Maloney\u2019s 1987 paper \u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d,\ndefending Searle, and R. Sharvy\u2019s 1983 critique, \u201cIt\nAin\u2019t the Meat, it\u2019s the Motion\u201d. AI proponents such\nas Kurzweil (1999, see also Richards 2002) have continued to hold that\nAI systems can potentially have such mental properties as\nunderstanding, intelligence, consciousness and intentionality, and\nwill exceed human abilities in these areas.\n\nOther critics of Searle\u2019s position take intentionality more\nseriously than Boden does, but deny his dualistic distinction between\noriginal and derived intentionality. Dennett (1987, e.g.) argues that\nall intentionality is derived, in that attributions of intentionality\n\u2013 to animals, other people, and even ourselves \u2013 are\ninstrumental and allow us to predict behavior, but they are not\ndescriptions of intrinsic properties. As we have seen, Dennett is\nconcerned about the slow speed of things in the Chinese Room, but he\nargues that once a system is working up to speed, it has all that is\nneeded for intelligence and derived intentionality \u2013 and derived\nintentionality is the only kind that there is, according to Dennett. A\nmachine can be an intentional system because intentional explanations\nwork in predicting the machine\u2019s behavior. Dennett also suggests\nthat Searle conflates intentionality with awareness of intentionality.\nIn his syntax-semantic arguments, \u201cSearle has apparently\nconfused a claim about the underivability of semantics from syntax\nwith a claim about the underivability of the consciousness of\nsemantics from syntax\u201d (336). The emphasis on consciousness\nforces us to think about things from a first-person point of view, but\nDennett 2017 continues to press the claim that this is a fundamental\nmistake if we want to understand the mental. \n\nWe might also worry that Searle conflates meaning and interpretation,\nand that Searle\u2019s original or underived intentionality is just\nsecond-order intentionality, a representation of what an intentional\nobject represents or means. Dretske and others have seen\nintentionality as information-based. One state of the world, including\na state in a computer, may carry information about other states in the\nworld, and this informational aboutness is a mind-independent feature\nof states. Hence it is a mistake to hold that conscious attributions\nof meaning are the source of intentionality. \n\nOthers have noted that Searle\u2019s discussion has shown a shift\nover time from issues of intentionality and understanding to issues of\nconsciousness. Searle links intentionality to awareness of\nintentionality, in holding that intentional states are at least\npotentially conscious. In his 1996 book, The Conscious Mind,\nDavid Chalmers notes that although Searle originally directs his\nargument against machine intentionality, it is clear from later\nwritings that the real issue is consciousness, which Searle holds is a\nnecessary condition of intentionality. It is consciousness that is\nlacking in digital computers. Chalmers uses thought experiments to\nargue that it is implausible that one system has some basic mental\nproperty (such as having qualia) that another system lacks, if it is\npossible to imagine transforming one system into the other, either\ngradually (as replacing neurons one at a time by digital circuits), or\nall at once, switching back and forth between flesh and silicon.\n\nA second strategy regarding the attribution of intentionality is taken\nby critics who in effect argue that intentionality is an intrinsic\nfeature of states of physical systems that are causally connected with\nthe world in the right way, independently of interpretation (see the\npreceding Syntax and Semantics section). Fodor\u2019s semantic\nexternalism is influenced by Fred Dretske, but they come to different\nconclusions with regard to the semantics of states of computers. Over\na period of years, Dretske developed an historical account of meaning\nor mental content that would preclude attributing beliefs and\nunderstanding to most machines. Dretske (1985) agrees with Searle that\nadding machines don\u2019t literally add; we do the adding,\nusing the machines. Dretske emphasizes the crucial role of natural\nselection and learning in producing states that have genuine content.\nHuman built systems will be, at best, like Swampmen (beings that\nresult from a lightning strike in a swamp and by chance happen to be a\nmolecule by molecule copy of some human being, say, you) \u2013 they\nappear to have intentionality or mental states, but do not, because\nsuch states require the right history. AI states will generally be\ncounterfeits of real mental states; like counterfeit money, they may\nappear perfectly identical but lack the right pedigree. But\nDretske\u2019s account of belief appears to make it distinct from\nconscious awareness of the belief or intentional state (if that is\ntaken to require a higher order thought), and so would apparently\nallow attribution of intentionality to artificial systems that can get\nthe right history by learning.\n\nHoward Gardiner endorses Zenon Pylyshyn\u2019s criticisms of\nSearle\u2019s view of the relation of brain and intentionality, as\nsupposing that intentionality is somehow a stuff \u201csecreted by\nthe brain\u201d, and Pylyshyn\u2019s own counter-thought experiment\nin which one\u2019s neurons are replaced one by one with integrated\ncircuit workalikes (see also Cole and Foelber (1984) and Chalmers\n(1996) for exploration of neuron replacement scenarios). Gardiner\nholds that Searle owes us a more precise account of intentionality\nthan Searle has given so far, and until then it is an open question\nwhether AI can produce it, or whether it is beyond its scope. Gardiner\nconcludes with the possibility that the dispute between Searle and his\ncritics is not scientific, but (quasi?) religious.\n",
