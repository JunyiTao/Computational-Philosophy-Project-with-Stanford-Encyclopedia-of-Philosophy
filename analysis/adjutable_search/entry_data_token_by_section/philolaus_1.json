    "main_text": "Life and Writings || The Authenticity Question\n1.2 The Authenticity Question\n\nIn the case of most ancient authors, the assumption is that a text\nhanded down in their name is genuine, unless strong reasons can be\ngiven for regarding it as a forgery. This standard assumption does not\napply to the Pythagorean tradition. Many more demonstrably spurious\ntexts have survived (collected in Thesleff 1965) than texts that can\nwith confidence be regarded as genuine. Some forgeries may have been\nproduced for monetary reasons; a text of a \u201crare\u201d work by\na Pythagorean author could fetch a large sum from book collectors.\nThere were characteristics unique to the Pythagorean tradition,\nhowever, that led to a proliferation of forgeries. Pythagoras himself\nwrote nothing. Starting as early as the later fourth century BC\n(Burkert 1972a, 53\u201383; Huffman 1993, 22\u20136), however, he\ncame to be regarded, in some circles, as the philosopher par\nexcellence, to whom all truth had been revealed. All later philosophy,\ninsofar as it was true, was a restatement of this original revelation\n(see, e.g., O\u2019Meara 1989). In order to support this view of\nPythagoras, texts were forged in the name of Pythagoras and other\nearly Pythagoreans, showing that they had, in fact, anticipated the\nmost important ideas of Plato and Aristotle. These pseudo-Pythagorean\ntexts are thus characterized by the use of central Platonic and\nAristotelian ideas, expressed in technical Platonic and Aristotelian\nterminology. The date and place of origin of these pseudo-Pythagorean\ntreatises is difficult to determine, but most seem to have been\ncomposed between 150 BC and 100 AD (Burkert 1972b; Centrone 1990 and\n2014; Moraux 1984); Rome (Burkert 1972b) and Alexandria (Centrone 1990\nand 2014) are the most likely places of origin. As a result of these\nunique features of the Pythagorean tradition, any fragment assigned to\na Pythagorean philosopher such as Philolaus must be examined carefully\nbefore it can be accepted as genuine.\n\nIn 1962, Guthrie, in his History of Greek Philosophy,\nregarded the issue of the authenticity of the fragments handed down in\nPhilolaus\u2019 name as undecided, although he commented that opponents of\nauthenticity did \u201cnot seem to be at their best on the\nsubject\u201d (331). In that same year Burkert provided decisive\narguments, which have led to a consensus that a core of the fragments\nof Philolaus are authentic. Earlier discussions of the authenticity of\nthe fragments were often based on the faulty assumption that the\nfragments were either all genuine or all spurious. Opponents of\nauthenticity typically showed that a few of the fragments were\nspurious and then assumed that all the rest were as well (e.g.,\nBywater 1868). Given the amount of forgery in the Pythagorean\ntradition, however, even if fragments from a genuine book of Philolaus\nsurvive, it is likely that fragments from spurious works survive as\nwell. Burkert made a crucial distinction between two traditions\nconcerning Pythagoreanism. One begins already in Plato\u2019s Academy and\ntreats Pythagoreanism as largely identical with later Platonic\nthought, including the postulation of the one and the indefinite dyad\nas first principles (1972a, 53\u201383). This is the tradition which\ncame to dominate among later Neoplatonists and which served as the\nbasis for the production of the pseudo-Pythagorean writings. The\nsecond tradition is represented by Aristotle, who presents\nfifth-century Pythagoreanism as having had some influence on Plato but\nas radically different from Plato in making no distinction between the\nintelligible and sensible world (1972a, 28\u201352). Burkert then\nshowed that, while some of the fragments of Philolaus did employ\nPlatonic and Aristotelian ideas and hence were spurious, other\nfragments were in very close agreement with Aristotle\u2019s account of\nfifth-century Pythagoreanism and hence likely to be authentic.\n\nAristotle\u2019s testimony on the Pythagoreans gives rise to one remaining\npuzzle, which is relevant to the authenticity of the core of fragments\nidentified by Burkert. Aristotle specifically identifies the\nPythagoreanism that he discusses as contemporary with or a little\nearlier than the atomists (Metaph. 985b23 ff.). This dating\nfits Philolaus exactly. Aristotle discusses the Pythagoreans in many\nplaces and he is clearly not always referring to Philolaus.\nNonetheless, the central Pythagorean metaphysical and cosmological\nsystem to which Aristotle refers repeatedly, with limiters and\nunlimiteds as first principles, the emphasis on the role of harmony in\nthe cosmos and the peculiar astronomical system, which makes the earth\na planet orbiting around the central fire, corresponds in great detail\nwith the fragments and testimonia preserved in the later tradition as\ncoming from Philolaus\u2019 book (Metaph. 986a8\u201321,\n987a13\u201317,990a8\u201310 etc.; for an opposing view see Zhmud\n1998). The problem is that Aristotle never explicitly describes the\nPythagoreanism which he discusses as derived from Philolaus\u2019 book. He\nonly refers to Philolaus once by name, and that is in relation to an\napothegm which has no obvious connection to his general presentation\nof Pythagoreanism (EE 1225a30 = Fr. 16). Everywhere else\nAristotle refers to the system he describes as the work of \u201cthe\nso-called Pythagoreans\u201d or the Italian philosophers. The former\nexpression shows that Aristotle has his doubts about the connections\nbetween these philosophers and Pythagoras himself. Aristotle never\nmentions Pythagoras himself in connection with the system of\n\u201cthe so-called Pythagoreans\u201d and clearly dates that system\nafter the time of Pythagoras. If Aristotle is relying heavily on\nPhilolaus\u2019 book, however, why does he never mention Philolaus by name\nwhen describing the Pythagorean system? Some might argue that\nAristotle did not know of a book by Philolaus and hence that there was\nno such book. Two considerations suggest another explanation. First,\nAristotle discusses the Pythagorean system in considerable detail and\nin at least one passage strongly implies that what he is reporting is\nbased on a written text (Metaph. 1091a13). As Burkert notes,\nthat written source cannot have been ascribed to \u201cthe so-called\nPythagoreans\u201d and must have been assigned to some author. The\nevidence suggests that Philolaus\u2019 book was the only book by a\nPythagorean circulating in the fifth century (see 1.3 below), and, as\nwe have seen, the reports of the contents of that book agree with what\nAristotle reports quite closely. There simply is no other plausible\ncandidate for Aristotle\u2019s written source. Second, Philolaus\u2019 book\nseems to have been available to Aristotle\u2019s pupil Meno (DK 44\nA27\u20138) and hence is likely to have been available to Aristotle\nas well. The most reasonable conclusion is that Aristotle is relying\nlargely on Philolaus\u2019 book for his description of fifth-century\nPythagoreanism but chooses not to refer to him explicitly. Aristotle\nmakes clear that there are several groups of people included under the\nheading \u201cso-called Pythagoreans,\u201d by explicitly\ndistinguishing those Pythagoreans who posited the table of opposites\nfrom the main Pythagorean system which he describes (Metaph.\n986a22). For whatever reason, it was the fashion to refer to a group\nof related figures as Pythagoreans, and Aristotle follows this fashion\nrather than singling Philolaus out from the group, even though he\nrelies heavily on Philolaus\u2019 book. Primavesi has recently suggested\nthat some of the puzzles about Aristotle\u2019s account of Pythagoreanism\ncan be mitigated if we recognize that he presents a developmental\nacount by reconstructing a gradual transition from early\narithmological speculations to Philolaus\u2019 theory of principles (2014).\n\n",
