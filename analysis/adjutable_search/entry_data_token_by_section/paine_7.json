    "main_text": "Political Theory || Property\n2.6 Property\n\nThe ad hoc turn to welfare in the second part of Rights\nof Man (1792) finds some compensation in the short pamphlet,\nAgrarian Justice (1795\u20136), that Paine wrote after his\nrelease from prison in response to the unrest in 1795 in Paris as\nprotests spread against the economic hardship suffered in the capital,\nstimulating culminating in Babeuf\u2019s conspiracy of equals. Unlike\nthe final chapter of Rights of Man, Agrarian Justice provides\na principled defense for welfare provision, rooted in a conception of\nthe original equality of man and the equal right to a subsistence from\nthe earth. He acknowledges that there are benefits to allowing private\nproperty in land and its cultivation, but argues that every proprietor\nowes the community a ground-rent for the land he holds, which should\nbe used as a right of inheritance for all, paying the sum of \u00a315\nas a compensation for the loss of natural inheritance at the age of\ntwenty-one and an annual grant to the aged. These payments are a\nmatter of right, not of charity. A claim against the common stock that\nall may make, on the ground that \u2018no person ought to be in a\nworse condition when born under what is called a state of\ncivilization, than he would have been had he been born in a state of\nnature\u2026\u2019 (I, 613). The money is to be raised from\nprogressive taxation in inherited wealth and will contribute to its\nmore equal distribution.\n\nTo modern critics it may seem odd to couple the essentially\nlibertarian sentiments of the opening of the second part of Rights\nof Man with a major raft of welfare reforms. But Paine clearly\ndid not think about these reforms as an extension of\ngovernment. Although he does not make the point, they seem to\nbe more a matter of administration, and that is in keeping with his\nessentially consensual view of the formal exercise of responsibilities\nby those invested with the confidence of the nation as a whole.\n\nPaine\u2019s proposals probably had little practical effect on the\nemergence of the welfare state, but they helped influence early\nsocialist doctrines and working men\u2019s associations, and they\nhave since been taken up by those advocating a right to basic income\nor a child inheritance as a way of ensuring that the young need not\ninherit their parents\u2019 poverty.(See Van Parijs and Vanderborght,\n2017)\n",
