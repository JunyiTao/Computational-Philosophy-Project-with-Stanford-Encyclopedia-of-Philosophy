    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nKazimierz (or Kasimir) Jerzy Skrzypna-Twardowski, Ritter von\nOgo\u0144czyk was born to Polish parents on October 20, 1866 in\nVienna, which was then the capital of the Habsburg Empire. From 1877\nto 1885 he attended the Theresian Academy (Theresianum), the secondary\nschool of Vienna's bourgeoise elite. Like many other high-school\nstudents at the time, his philosophy textbook was the\nPhilosophische Propedaeutik by Robert Zimmermann, Bolzano's\n\u2018favorite pupil\u2019 (Herzensjunge). The book covered\nempirical psychology, logic, and the introduction to philosophy.\n\nIn 1885 Twardowski enrolled at the University of Vienna. The year\nafter he became a student of Franz Brentano, for whom he felt\n\u201cthe most sincere awe and veneration\u201d and whom he\nremembered as \u201cuncompromising and relentless in his quest for\nrigor in formulation, consistency in expression, and precision in the\nworking out of proofs\u201d (Twardowski 1926, 20). In addition to\nphilosophy, Twardowski also studied history, mathematics, physics, and\nphysiology (with Sigmund Exner, the son of Bolzano's correspondent\nFranz Exner; ibid., 21). While a student, Twardowski was a close\nfriend of Alois H\u00f6fler, Christian von Ehrenfels, Josef Klemens\nKreibig, and Hans Schmidkunz\u2014the latter initiated regular\nmeetings between younger and older students of Brentano and founded\nthe Vienna Philosophical Society in 1888. Twardowski defended his\ndoctoral dissertation, Idea and Perception\u2014An Epistemological\nInvestigation of Descartes (published in 1892), in the Fall of\n1891. Since Brentano had resigned from his chair in 1880, Twardowski's\nofficial PhD supervisor was Robert Zimmermann. In 1891\u20131892\nTwardowski spent time as a researcher both in Leipzig, where he\nfollowed courses by Wilhelm Wundt and Oswald K\u00fclpe, and in\nMunich, where he attended the lectures of Carl Stumpf, another pupil\nof Brentano. Between 1892 and 1895 Twardowski earned a living working\nfor an insurance company and writing for German-language and\nPolish-language newspapers about philosophy, literature, and music\nwhile working on his Habilitation thesis, On the Content and Object\nof Presentations\u2014A Psychological Investigation (1894), and\nteaching as Privatdozent at the University of Vienna, where he gave\ncourses in logic, on the immortality of the soul and a\npracticum on Hume's Enquiry concerning Human\nUnderstanding.\n\nIn 1895 Twardowski, then 29, was appointed as extraordinarius\nat the University of Lvov (then Lemberg, now Lviv, in Polish\nLw\u00f3w), one of the two Polish-speaking Universities of the\nEmpire. He saw it as his duty to export Brentano's style of\nphilosophizing to Poland and spent most of his time organizing Lvov's\nphilosophical life. He reanimated the Lvov Philosophical Circle and\ngave lectures aimed at a broader public. He organized his teaching in\ngeneral \u2018core courses\u2019 in logic, psychology, ethics, and\nthe history of philosophy (given and updated every four years), and\nplaced less emphasis on specialized courses. Further, he inaugurated a\nphilosophical seminar and reading room, where he made his private\nlibrary available to students, with whom he always maintained close\nand frequent personal contacts. Relatively many of Twardowski's\nstudents were women (among others, Izydora D\u0105mbska, Maria\nLutman-Kokoszy\u0144ska, and Seweryna \u0141uszczewska-Romahnowa, all\nof whom held philosophy chairs later). At a certain point, Twardowski\nhad managed to create three concentric circles of philosophical\ninfluence: there was the Philosophical Circle, open to all university\ndepartments, the Polish Philosophical Society (1904), open to\nprofessional philosophers, and the journal Ruch Filozoficzny,\nconceived as an organ of promotion of philosophy at large and open to\neveryone (1911). Twardowski also established a laboratory of\npsychology in 1907. As he writes, he was waging \u201ca most\naggressive propaganda campaign on behalf of philosophy\u201d\n(Twardowski 1926, 20). The campaign soon resulted in his lectures\nbeing moved to the Great Concert Hall of the Lvov Musical Society when\nthe number of students reached two thousand (in the mid-Twenties he\nlectured in the Apollo movie theater, at 7 a.m. in the summer and 8\na.m. in the winter, without academic quarter). All this amounted to\nthe establishment of a philosophical movement that soon became known\nas a proper school: first, until the First World War, it was known as\nthe Lvov School; then, when the Russian-speaking University of Warsaw\nagain became Polish-speaking, and Twardowski's students starting\ngetting positions and having their own students there, it was known as\nthe Lvov-Warsaw School (see\n Lvov-Warsaw School).\n The name is somewhat inaccurate, for Twardowski's students occupied\nphilosophy chairs in all post-war Polish universities, not only in\nLvov and Warsaw. As has often been pointed out, what all students of\nTwardowski had in common was not a particular set of views, but a\nrather distinctive attitude to philosophical problems informed by\nprecision and clarity that they inherited from Twardowski's general\nconception of methodology, and which he valued most highly. According\nto Jordan, Twardowski led his students\n\nto undertake painstaking analysis of specific problems which were rich\nin conceptual and terminological distinctions, and directed rather to\nthe clarification than to the solution of the problems involved.\n(Jordan 1963,\n 7f)[2]\n\n\nIn this, Twardowski's students learned what he had learned from\nBrentano, namely \n\nhow to strive relentlessly after matter-of-factness, and how to pursue\na method of analysis and investigation that, insofar as that is\npossible, guarantees that matter-of-factness. He proved to me by\nexample that the most difficult problems can be clearly formulated,\nand the attempts at their solution no less clearly presented, provided\none is clear within oneself. The emphasis he placed on sharp\nconceptual distinctions that did not lapse into fruitless nit-picking\nwas an important guideline for my own writings. (Twardowski 1926, 20)\n\n\nTwardowski was convinced that the philosophical way of thinking he\nadvocated, namely precision in thought and writing and rigor in\nargumentation, was directly beneficial to practical life. It was with\nthe idea of proving exactly this point\u2014by way of his personal\nexample\u2014that he accepted to head various kinds of committees\n(among others, the University Lectures Series, the Society for Women\nin Higher Education, the Society for Teachers in High Education, the\nFederation of Austrian Middle-School Teacher Candidates) and to be\nDean twice and Rector three times in a row (though he repeatedly\nrefused to be Minister of Education). All these activities cost him a\nlot of time: in fact, Twardowski's choice to be most of all an\neducator and an organizer left him very little time for academic\nwriting. Besides, as he reports, Twardowski wasn't much interested in\nthe publication of his ideas. Thus, since he placed high demands on\nthe clarity and the logical cogency of philosophical work, he set out\nto publish only when it was required by external circumstances\n(Twardowski 1926, 30). As a consequence, in his Lvov years, Twardowski\npublished little. He officially retired in 1930.\n\nTwardowski died on February 11, 1938.\n\nOn Twardowski's life and education in Vienna up to 1895 (as well as\nTwardowski's early activity in Lvov and Vienna's \u2018war\nparenthesis\u2019 in 1914-1915) see Bro\u017cek 2012; Twardowski's\nheritage and his achievements as an educator and organizer in Lvov,\nsee Cze\u017cowski 1948, Ingarden 1948; Ajdukiewicz 1959,\nKotarbi\u0144ski 1959 (in Polish: excerpts in English are to be found\nin Bro\u017cek 2014), D\u0105mbska 1978, Wole\u0144ski 1989, 1997 and\n1998.
