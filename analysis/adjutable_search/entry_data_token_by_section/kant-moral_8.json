    "main_text": "The Unity of the Formulas\n9. The Unity of the Formulas\n\nKant claimed that all of these CI formulas were equivalent.\nUnfortunately, he does not say in what sense. What he says is\nthat these \u201care basically only so many formulations of precisely\nthe same law, each one of them by itself uniting the other two within\nit,\u201d and that the differences between them are \u201cmore\nsubjectively than objectively practical\u201d in the sense that each\naims \u201cto bring an Idea of reason closer to intuition (by means\nof a certain analogy) and thus nearer to feeling\u201d (G 4:435). He\nalso says that one formula \u201cfollows from\u201d another (G\n4:431), and that the concept foundational to one formula \u201cleads\nto a closely connected\u201d concept at the basis of another formula\n(G 4:433). Thus, his claim that the formulations are equivalent could\nbe interpreted in a number of ways.\n\nKant\u2019s statement that each formula \u201cunites the other two\nwithin it\u201d initially suggests that the formulas are equivalent\nin meaning, or at least one could analytically derive one\nformula from another. Some of Kant\u2019s commentators, for example,\nhave argued along the following lines: That I should always treat\nhumanity as an end in itself entails that I should act only on maxims\nthat are consistent with themselves as universal laws of nature\n(O\u2019Neill 1975, 1990; Engstrom 2009; Sensen 2011). There are\nremaining doubts some commentators have, however, about whether this\nstrategy can capture the full meaning of the Humanity Formula or\nexplain all of the duties that Kant claims to derive from it (Wood\n1999, 2007; Cureton 2013).\n\nPerhaps, then, if the formulas are not equivalent in meaning, they are\nnevertheless logically interderivable and hence equivalent in this\nsense. The universal law formula is not itself derived, as some of\nKant\u2019s interpreters have suggested, from the principle of\nnon-contradiction. That would have the consequence that the CI is a\nlogical truth, and Kant insists that it is not or at least that it is\nnot analytic. Since the CI formulas are not logical truths, then, it\nis possible that they could be logically interderivable. However,\ndespite his claim that each contains the others within it, what we\nfind in the Groundwork seems best interpreted as a derivation\nof each successive formula from the immediately preceding formula.\nThere are, nonetheless, a few places in which it seems that Kant is\ntrying to work in the opposite direction. One is found in his\ndiscussion of the Humanity Formula. There Kant says that only\nsomething \u201cwhose existence in itself had an absolute\nworth\u201d could be the ground of a categorically binding law (G\n4:428). He then boldly proclaims that humanity is this absolutely\nvaluable thing, referring to this as a \u201cpostulate\u201d that he\nwill argue for in the final chapter of the Groundwork (G\n4:429n). One might take this as expressing Kant\u2019s intention to\nderive thereby the universal law formula from the Humanity Formula:\nIf something is absolutely valuable, then we must\nact only on maxims that can be universal laws. But (he postulates)\nhumanity is absolutely valuable. Thus, we must act only on\nmaxims that can be universal laws. This (we think) anomalous\ndiscussion may well get at some deep sense in which Kant thought the\nformulations were equivalent. Nonetheless, this derivation of the\nuniversal law formulation from the Humanity Formulation seems to\nrequire a substantive, synthetic claim, namely, that humanity\nis indeed absolutely valuable. And if it does require this, then,\ncontrary to Kant\u2019s own insistence, the argument of\nGroundwork II does not appear to be merely an\nanalytic argument meant simply to establish the content of the moral\nlaw.\n\nThe most straightforward interpretation of the claim that the formulas\nare equivalent is as the claim that following or applying each formula\nwould generate all and only the same duties (Allison 2011). This seems\nto be supported by the fact that Kant used the same examples through\nthe Law of Nature Formula and the Humanity Formula. Thus, the\nUniversal Law Formulation generates a duty to \u03c6 if and only if the\nHumanity Formula generates a duty to \u03c6, (and so on for the other\nformulations). In other words, respect for humanity as an end in\nitself could never lead you to act on maxims that would generate a\ncontradiction when universalized, and vice versa. This way of\nunderstanding Kant\u2019s claim also fits with his statement that\nthere is no \u201cobjective practical difference\u201d between the\nformulations although there are \u201csubjective\u201d differences.\nThe subjective differences between formulas are presumably differences\nthat appeal in different ways to various conceptions of what morality\ndemands of us. But this difference in meaning is compatible with there\nbeing no practical difference, in the sense that conformity to one\nformulation cannot lead one to violate another formulation.\n",
