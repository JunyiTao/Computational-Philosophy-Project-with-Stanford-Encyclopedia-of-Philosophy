    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of Fictional Entities || Creationism\n1.3 Creationism\n\nThe intuition that story-tellers have some kind of creative role to\nplay is accounted for by so called artifactualist, or\ncreationist, accounts of fictional entities (see Searle 1979,\nSalmon 1998, Thomasson 1999, Voltolini 2006; the position was also\ndefended in Kripke 2013, and elements of the position are found in van\nInwagen\u2019s (1977) theory of fictional objects as posits of\nliterary criticism; Ingarden 1931 is a significant historical\nforerunner). According to such accounts, fictional objects are\nartifacts since they come into being once they are conceived by their\nauthors; to that extent, they are authorial creations. Moreover, they\nare abstract entities, just as abstract neo-Meinongians believe.\nUnlike Platonic abstracta, however, they not only have a\nbeginning in time, but they are also dependent entities since\nthey depend on other entities for their existence. (Roughly speaking,\nan entity O existentially depends on another entity\nO\u2032 just if O couldn\u2019t exist without\nO\u2032 existing (cf. Thomasson 1999). For a more\ndiscriminating account, one that avoids the consequence that\neverything existentially depends on necessary existents like natural\nnumbers, see Fine 1994.) More specifically, fictional objects depend\nhistorically rigidly on the authors who create them (necessarily, if\nO comes into being at t, then the author(s) who\ncreates O exists at some time t\u2032 before\nt) and constantly generically on the literary works that\nfeature them (necessarily, if O goes on existing, then some\nliterary work W or other featuring O exists during\nO\u2019s time of existence) (see Thomasson 1999 for an\nextended discussion of such dependencies). While historical rigid\ndependence accounts for a fictional object\u2019s coming into being,\nconstant generic dependence accounts for its continued existence or\npersistence. Such an account of the persistence of fictional objects\nseems as intuitive as the account of their generation. Not only do we\nsay that some given fictional object was created at a certain point of\ntime, but we might also describe it as having a certain age\n(Hamlet, we might point out, is now over 400 years old).\n\nNote that creationism thus characterized earns its keep from the\n\u2018obviousness\u2019 of the thought that authors somehow create\nfictional characters through the creation of fictional works in which\nthey appear. Language seems to support this thought: we routinely hear\nstatements like \u201cHamlet is one of Shakespeare\u2019s most\ncomplex creations\u201d. It is on the basis of this thought that\ncreationists then hypothesize that fictional objects literally are the\ncreations of their authors: not concrete creations, clearly, so\ntherefore non-concrete, abstract creations. But this move is far from\ninnocent. Yagisawa (2001), for example, argues that creationism\nconflicts sharply with other seemingly obvious thoughts, for example\nthe nonexistence datum that fictional characters like Hamlet\ndon\u2019t exist (for a response, see Goodman 2004). At an even more\nfundamental level, Brock (2010) argues that the creationist\u2019s\nappeal to creation is explanatorily void, leaving more questions than\nanswers. Not only is it left unclear when a fictional object\nis created, but also how it is created. Appealing to\nauthorial intentions, for example, is inadequate, for such intentions\nmay be lacking or overridden. (Brock considers an imaginary scenario\nin which Doyle intended Holmes and Watson to be the same character,\nbut died before writing the story that revealed this (361\u2013362).\nArguably, this wouldn\u2019t change the fact that Holmes is distinct\nfrom Watson.) Some creationists have responded to such cases by\narguing for models of creation on which the creation of fictional\nobjects may be inadvertent, perhaps because of the role played by\nreaders or because of authorial confusion. (Lee 2022, Zvolenszky\n2016).\n\nCreationists themselves claim that the appeal to creation does solve a\nnumber of significant problems that afflict other metaphysical\ntheories. There is, for example, no mythical god Moloch, for nobody\nhas created such an object by gathering various properties and\nembedding them in a certain narrative. And although they share all the\nproperties attributed to them in the respective renditions of Don\nQuixote, there are two Don Quixotes, Cervantes\u2019s\nand Menard\u2019s, not just one, because there were two utterly\nindependent acts of authorial generation (cf. Voltolini 2006: 32ff.).\nIt is not clear, however, how creationists can deal with a related\nproblem that affects their theory, the problem of indiscriminable\nfictional objects (Everett 2013: 191ff., Kroon 2015). Intuitively,\nthere were thousands of fictional dwarves who took part in\nTolkien\u2019s War between the Dwarves and Orcs, without\nTolkien\u2019s engaging in thousands of acts of dwarf-creation. (In\nresponse to this worry, some creationists have denied that there are\nsuch characters; see, for example, Voltolini 2006: 209\u201311,\nSchnieder & von Solodkoff 2009: 147.)\n\nIt is evident, then, that creationism is not without its problems.\nPerhaps the most significant ones have to do with the nature of the\ncreative process and the relation between the creative process and the\nidentity of fictional objects. It seems, for example, that what comes\ninto existence on the above account of the generating process (which\ntalks of authors\u2019 conceiving of their literary creations) is not\na fictional object as such, but rather a (mere) intentional object,\nthe target of a certain authorial thought. A mere intentional object\nis not yet a fictional object, as Thomasson (1999:89) agrees, so what\nmakes it one? Does it become one by being able to be\n\u2018shared\u2019 by more than one person through appearing in a\ntext (maybe not a physical copy but one stored in memory)? Or is there\na more discriminating criterion to single out which intentional\nobjects are fictional objects?\n\nThis question is perhaps best answered by giving a somewhat different\naccount of the generating process. Thus, some creationists (Schiffer\n1996, 2003; Thomasson 2003a,b) say that a fictional object comes into\nbeing as an abstract artifact not when an author first conceives of\nit, but only once a certain make-believe process has come to an end,\nnamely, the process in which someone\u2014typically, a\nstory-teller\u2014pretends that there is an individual who is\nsuch-and-such and does so-and-so. It is disputable whether this\nprovides a sufficient condition for ficta generation; perhaps\nsomething else is needed, such as a reflexive stance on the very\nmake-believe process itself (Voltolini 2006, 2015a, 2020a).\n\nCreationists may even choose to downplay the issue of ficta\ngeneration. Fictional objects can perhaps be construed as\ninstitutional entities along the model of baptisms and marriages,\nentities that figure in the general inventory of what there is, but do\nso for free. Just as one can allow for the existence of baptisms and\nmarriages simply by appealing to constitutive rules along the model of\nSearle\u2019s (1969) account of illocutionary acts, so one can say\nthat fictional objects come to exist once certain practices having do\nwith make-believe (and possibly also its recognition) are in force\n(Thomasson 2003a,b, 2014; Voltolini 2020b). Alternatively, one may\nappeal to regulative rules and say that, just like driving or\nqueueing, fiction requires an equilibrium solution to a coordination\nproblem in the communication, among consumers of fiction, of the\ncontent of their imaginings. Fictional objects arguably provide\nstability in such imaginings. On this picture, fictional objects,\nqua institutional entities, are simply generated by the fact\nthat giving expression to such imaginings also counts as declaring\nthat things stand in a certain way, thereby constituting the very fact\nthey declare, much like standard declarations such as a declaration of\nmarriage (Abell 2020). (It is of course important for this view to\njustify how the use of language resulting in ficta generation\ncan count as authoritative in the very same sense as the words of an\nofficer declaring, and thereby generating, a marriage.)\n\nBut whatever the right account, another question remains: even if we\nagree on the nature of the process-type that gives rise to a fictional\nobject, what is the thing that is purportedly generated in\nthis way? What are the identity conditions for fictional objects?\nCreationists typically do not think that a fictional object possesses\nthe properties that characterize it in the story in which it appears.\nA fictional object simply has those properties according to the\nstory. It is not true of Holmes, for instance, that\n\u2018he\u2019 (or it) is a detective\u2014only physical objects,\nnot an abstract artifact, can be a detective. In Williamson\u2019s\nterms (2000: 203), it is not true that Holmes, as a cultural artifact,\nis a detective that is fictional. Instead, what is true of Holmes is\nthat \u2018he\u2019 is a detective according to the Holmes stories\n(equally, Holmes is male according to those stories, and so deserving\nof the masculine pronoun \u201che\u201d). In general, for\ncreationists the only properties that fictional objects genuinely\npossess are the properties that neo-Meinongians would call\nextranuclear or take to be externally predicated: properties like\nbeing a fictional detective or being Doyle\u2019s\ncreation or even being a detective according to the Holmes\nstories (cf. Thomasson 1999). The approach thus fails to account\nfor the idea, mentioned earlier, that there must be a sense in which\nfictional objects actually have the properties that\ncharacterize them in the relevant stories.\n\nIn addition, the restricted nature of such properties makes it hard to\nsee how to individuate a fictional entity. Thomasson gives sufficient\nidentity conditions for fictional entities within a literary\nwork: x and y are the same fictional object\nF if x and y are ascribed exactly the same\nproperties in the work (1999: 63). But what do we say in the case of\nfictional objects that appear in different works? Thomasson admits\nthat in this case one can only provide a necessary condition:\nx and y are the same fictional object only if the\nauthor of the second work \\(W'\\) is competently acquainted with\nx of the previous work \\(W\\), and intends to import\nx into \\(W'\\) as y (1999: 67). The reason why she\nthinks this cannot be a sufficient condition is that, no matter what\nthe author\u2019s intentions are, he does not succeed in importing\nx (an entity that appears in W) into \\(W'\\) as\ny if he attributes properties to y that are too\nradically different from the properties that were attributed to\nx in W (1999: 68). (There are other cases that show\neven more clearly how authorial intention can be thwarted. Thus,\nconsider a case of a fusion of characters, in which an author\nintends to import into \\(W'\\) two characters x and\ny from a previous work W as a single character\nz. Clearly, given the transitivity of identity, z is\nnot identical with either x or y, so the author\nfails in her attempt. Analogous problems arise in the converse\nsituation of character fission: cf. Voltolini 2012.)\n\nThe problem of the reliability of authorial intentions also arises in\nanother account, close to creationism, that has recently been\ndeveloped: the hylomorphist account (Evnine 2016). Just as ordinary\nartifacts (chairs, tables, statues ...) amount to the particular\narrangements of certain materials in accordance with certain creative\nintentions, so fictional objects come into play by arranging material\nof a specific kind, viz., the properties predicated in a certain\nfiction, in accordance with certain authorial intentions. On this\nmodel, fictional objects have their characterizing properties, albeit\nmerely contingently (the authorial plan may change). Once again,\nhowever, what specific authorial intention is in play and how it may\nbe put into force is a matter of debate. As before, there may be no\ncreative intention, or it may be overridden (to come back to a\nprevious example, few would take Holmes to be assembled out of\nproperties that include being identical to Watson, even if\nConan Doyle had, perversely, intended this).\n\nTo conclude this discussion of the metaphysics of fictional objects,\nit is worth noting that neo-Meinongian and creationist theories seem\nto suffer from complementary defects. On the one hand, neo-Meinongians\nprovide exact identity criteria for fictional objects, but these\ncriteria are clearly insufficient in that they do not take into\naccount the fact that such objects are products of the human mind. On\nthe other hand, creationists do account for this fact, but they only\nprovide relatively non-specific identity criteria for such entities.\nThose theories are normally taken to be incompatible, for they appeal\nto different metaphysical models\u2014broadly speaking, a Platonic\nmodel as opposed to a constructivist one. This claim of\nincompatibility should not be taken as definitive, however; there may\nwell be ways in which the two theories, or perhaps the most promising\nelements of each theory, can somehow be combined (for recent attempts\nto go in such a direction, cf. Zalta 2000, Voltolini 2006).\n",
