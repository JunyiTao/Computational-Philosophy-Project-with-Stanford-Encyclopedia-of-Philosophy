    "main_text": "Camus and the World of Violence: The Rebel\n4. Camus and the World of Violence: The Rebel\n\nThis meditation on absurdity and suicide follows closely on the\npublication of Camus\u2019s first novel, The Stranger, which\nalso centered on individual experience and revolves around its\nprotagonist\u2019s senseless murder of an Arab on a beach in Algiers\nand concludes with his execution by guillotine. And it is often\nforgotten that this absurdist novelist and philosopher was also a\npolitical activist\u2014he had been a member of the Algerian branch\nof the French Communist Party in the mid-1930s and was organizer of an\nAlgiers theater company that performed avant-garde and political\nplays\u2014as well as a crusading journalist. From October 1938 until\nJanuary 1940 he worked on Alger r\u00e9publicain and a\nsister newspaper. In June 1939 he wrote a series of reports on famine\nand poverty in the mountainous coastal region of Kabylie, among the\nfirst detailed articles ever written by a European Algerian describing\nthe wretched living conditions of the native population.\n\nAfter the start of World War II, Camus became editor of Le Soir\nr\u00e9publicain and as a pacifist opposed French entry into\nthe war. The spectacle of Camus and his mentor Pascal Pia running\ntheir left-wing daily into the ground because they rejected the\nurgency of fighting Nazism is one of the most striking but least\ncommented-on periods of his life. Misunderstanding Nazism at the\nbeginning of the war, he advocated negotiations with Hitler that would\nin part reverse the humiliations of the Treaty of Versailles. His\npacifism was in keeping with a time-honored French tradition, and\nCamus nevertheless reported for military service out of solidarity\nwith those young men, like his brother, who had become soldiers.\nIntending to serve loyally and to advocate a negotiated peace in the\nbarracks, he was angered that his tuberculosis disqualified him\n(Lottman, 201\u201331; Aronson 2004, 25\u201328).\n\nThese biographical facts are relevant to Camus\u2019s philosophical\ndevelopment after The Myth of Sisyphus. Moving to France and\neventually becoming engaged in the resistance to the German\noccupation, in two \u201cLetters to a German Friend\u201d published\nclandestinely in 1943 and 1944, Camus pondered the question whether\nviolence against the occupiers was justified. He spoke of the\n\u201cloathing we [French] had for all war,\u201d and the need\n\u201cto find out if we had the right to kill men, if we were allowed\nto add to the frightful misery of this world\u201d (RRD, 8).\nDespising war, suspicious of heroism, he claimed that the occupied\nFrench paid dearly for this detour \u201cwith prison sentences and\nexecutions at dawn, with desertions and separations, with daily pangs\nof hunger, with emaciated children, and above all, with humiliation of\nour human dignity\u201d (RRD, 8). Only when we were\n\u201cat death\u2019s door,\u201d and \u201cfar behind\u201d the\nGermans, did we understand the reasons for fighting, so that\nhenceforth we would struggle with a clear conscience and \u201cclean\nhands.\u201d In other words killing was morally permissible only\nwithin strict limits and after great provocation. Our moral strength\nwas rooted in the fact that we were fighting for justice and national\nsurvival. The subsequent letters continued to contrast the French with\nthe Germans on moral grounds drawn directly from Camus\u2019s\nevolving philosophy, and suggested the transition from The Myth of\nSisyphus to The Rebel: if both adversaries began with a\nsense of the world\u2019s absurdity, Camus claimed that the French\nacknowledged and lived within this awareness, while the Germans sought\nto overcome it by dominating the world.\n\nCamus\u2019s anti-Nazi commitment and newspaper experience led to him\nsucceeding Pia in March 1944 as editor of Combat, the main\nunderground newspaper of the non-Communist left. During this period\nCamus worked on The Plague which, as he later said,\n\u201chas as its obvious content the struggle of the European\nresistance movements against Nazism\u201d (LCE, 339). The\nnovel, begun during the war, describes an epidemic of the bubonic\nplague in the small Algerian city of Oran, which transforms every\naspect of daily life and shuts off the city from the surrounding\nworld. The only possible response besides quarantine is refusing to\npassively accept disease and death and to actively organize\n\u201csanitary squads\u201d to combat it. The Plague\nphilosophically anticipates The Rebel: despite\nindividuals\u2019 most ambitious goals, for example of Tarrou who\nseeks to end the death penalty and Father Paneloux, who demands that\nthe people of Oran embrace their guilt and God\u2019s love, the\nactual situation calls for a very limited and specific activity.\nIndividuals must act without fanfare or heroics and above all, in\nsolidarity with each other in seeking to limit the effects of the\nplague. Like Sisyphus, they act in full consciousness of their limits,\nexcept now as a we. The Plague depicts a collective and nonviolent\nresistance to an unexplained pestilence, and thus quite deliberately\ndoes not raise the tactical, strategic, and moral issues built into\nthe struggle of the Resistance against human occupiers (LCE,\n340\u20131). If readers did not see this as an issue in 1947, it\nbecame contentious as the political climate changed, and the novel was\nattacked by Roland Barthes and later by Sartre (Aronson 2004,\n228\u20139). In point of fact, after the Liberation the question of\nviolence continued to occupy Camus both politically and\nphilosophically. In 1945 his was one of the few voices raised in\nprotest against the American use of nuclear weapons to defeat Japan\n(Aronson 2004, 61\u201363). After the Liberation he opposed the death\npenalty for collaborators, then turned against Marxism and Communism\nfor embracing revolution, while rejecting the looming cold war and its\nthreatening violence. And then in The Rebel, Camus began to\nspell out his deeper understanding of violence.\n",
