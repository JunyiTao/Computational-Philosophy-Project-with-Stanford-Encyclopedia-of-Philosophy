    "main_text": "J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha || Life and works\n7.1 Life and works\n\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha, who was most probably the teacher of\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, probably lived in the early eighth\ncentury. Because his presentation of Madhyamaka incorporates much of\nthe terminology used by Dharmak\u012brti, a member of the\nepistemological tradition founded by Dign\u0101ga, he is usually\nportrayed as a follower of Bh\u0101vaviveka\u2019s approach to\nMadhyamaka. Like his disciple \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita,\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha also incorporates aspects of the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophy into his presentation of Madhyamaka and\ncan therefore be seen as a source of inspiration to those who strove\nto find a synthesis of the two principal schools of Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nBuddhism. He wrote a commentary to a key Mah\u0101y\u0101na scripture,\nSandhinirmocanas\u016btra, which was one of the principal\nsources of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophy. He is best known for an\nindependent treatise called\nSatya-dvaya-vibha\u1e45ga-k\u0101rik\u0101 (Verses on the\ndistinction between the two truths), on which he also provided a prose\ncommentary. The verse text along with its commentary can be referred\nto together as Satyadvayavibha\u1e45ga.\n",
