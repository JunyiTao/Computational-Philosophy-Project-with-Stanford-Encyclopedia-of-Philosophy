Empirical Challenges to Turiel\u2019s Definition of Morality: Does it Fail with \u201cNon-Prototypical\u201d Transgressions?\n\nThus far our focus has been on work that sought to test\nShweder\u2019s contention that Turiel\u2019s definition of morality\nwould not travel well because people in other cultures would offer\nmoral-pattern criterion judgments about transgressions that do not\ninvolve harm or justice or rights. But Haidt\u2019s analysis of the\nresponses of low SES American participants to transgressions that are\nedgier than the ones Turiel and his colleagues typically use suggests\nthat we do not have to travel abroad to gather data that might\nchallenge Turiel\u2019s definition of morality. This was an idea that\nhad occurred to Turiel quite independently. Two years before\nHaidt\u2019s study appeared, Turiel, Hildebrandt, and Wainryb (1991)\npublished a lengthy monograph in which they explored judgments of\nAmerican high school and college students about a variety of what they\nlabeled \u201cnonprototypical\u201d transgressions. \u201cIn the\nmoral domain\u201d, they tell us,\n\n\nprototypical stimuli essentially present actions entailing harm,\nfairness, or violations of rights in the absence of strong conflicting\nconcerns. (1991: 7)\n\n\nThe prototypical moral transgressions they used in these studies were\nkilling and rape; the non-prototypical transgressions were abortion,\npornography, homosexuality, and incest. Though they did not explicitly\nask whether anyone was harmed by these behaviors, they used responses\nto the justification questions to determine whether participants\nthought that the behaviors were harmful. Not surprisingly, many of the\nparticipants who thought that abortion was \u201cnot all right\u201d\njustified their judgment by appealing to the harm done to the unborn\nchild. Many participants also thought that pornography caused harm,\nand they used this belief to justify their negative evaluation of\npornography. The role of these beliefs is similar to the role of Hindu\nbeliefs about the consequences of eating chicken the day after\none\u2019s father has died. Participants who have these beliefs see\nharm, and offer negative assessments about actions that people who\ndon\u2019t share the beliefs find unproblematic.\n\nBut for our purposes, the most interesting nonprototypical\ntransgression used by Turiel and his colleagues was incest. \u201cOf\nall the nonprototypical issues we investigated\u201d, they tell us,\n\u201cincest was most closely assimilated to reasoning in the moral\ndomain\u201d (1991: 78). A substantial number of participants judged\nthat incest was \u201cnot all right\u201d, they generalized the\njudgment to other countries, and they indicated that their judgment\nwas authority independent\u2014not contingent on the laws or\npractices that prevailed in the United States or elsewhere. So their\nresponses fit the \u201cmoral\u201d pattern of criterion judgments.\nBut typically these participants did not justify their judgments by\nappeal to harm, justice or rights. Rather, they appealed to what\nTuriel and colleagues labeled \u201cdeterministic beliefs\u201d,\nwhich are \u201cstandards dictated by psychological normality,\nbiological order or religious order\u201d or to \u201ccustom and\ntradition\u201d (1991: 24 & 78). So the pattern of criterion\njudgments about incest provided by these participants looks to pose a\ndirect challenge to Turiel\u2019s definition of morality. They\nexhibit the \u201cmoral\u201d criterion judgment pattern, but they\ndo not judge that the transgression is harmful.\n\nIntriguingly, in summing up these findings, Turiel and his colleagues\nappear to walk back the claim that \u201c[t]he meaning of\n\u2018morality\u2019 is something discovered, not stipulated\u201d.\nThey recognize that the judgments about incest offered by some\nparticipants would be classified as moral on the basis of their\ncriterion judgments. But for several reasons the authors have\n\u201cnot chosen this alternative\u201d. They\n\n\nbelieve that it is more precise to restrict \u201cmoral\u201d to\nprototypical judgments and use different terms for judgments that are\nsomewhat different\u2026.\n\n\nAlso, and\n\n\nmost important, our terminology reflects a concern with identifying\nthe components of reasoning, as well as assumptions about reality,\nthat form part of social and moral judgments. (1991: 86)\n\n\nThough this passage, like much of Turiel\u2019s writing, is less than\ncrystal clear, it seems to be saying that restricting the term\n\u201cmoral\u201d to judgments about \u201cprototypical\u201d\ntransgressions (those that involve \u201charm, fairness, or\nviolations of rights in the absence of strong conflicting\nconcerns\u201d) and not applying it to judgments about incest is just\na terminological choice.\n",
