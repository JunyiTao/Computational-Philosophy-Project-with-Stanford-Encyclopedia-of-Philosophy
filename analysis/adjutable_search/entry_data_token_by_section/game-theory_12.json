    "main_text": "Commitment\n6. Commitment\n\nIn some games, a player can improve her outcome by taking an action\nthat makes it impossible for her to take what would be her best action\nin the corresponding simultaneous-move game. Such actions are referred\nto as commitments, and they can serve as alternatives to\nexternal enforcement in games which would otherwise settle on\nPareto-inefficient equilibria.\n\nConsider the following hypothetical example (which is not a\nPD). Suppose you own a piece of land adjacent to mine, and I\u2019d\nlike to buy it so as to expand my lot. Unfortunately, you don\u2019t\nwant to sell at the price I\u2019m willing to pay. If we move\nsimultaneously\u2014you post a selling price and I independently give\nmy agent an asking price\u2014there will be no sale. So I might try\nto change your incentives by playing an opening move in which I\nannounce that I\u2019ll build a putrid-smelling sewage disposal plant\non my land beside yours unless you sell, thereby inducing you to lower\nyour price. I\u2019ve now turned this into a sequential-move game.\nHowever, this move so far changes nothing. If you refuse to sell in\nthe face of my threat, it is then not in my interest to carry it out,\nbecause in damaging you I also damage myself. Since you know this you\nshould ignore my threat. My threat is incredible, a case of\ncheap talk.\n\nHowever, I could make my threat credible by committing\nmyself. For example, I could sign a contract with some farmers\npromising to supply them with treated sewage (fertilizer) from my\nplant, but including an escape clause in the contract releasing me\nfrom my obligation only if I can double my lot size and so put it to\nsome other use. Now my threat is credible: if you don\u2019t sell,\nI\u2019m committed to building the sewage plant. Since you know this,\nyou now have an incentive to sell me your land in order to escape its\nruination.\n\nThis sort of case exposes one of many fundamental differences between\nthe logic of non-parametric and parametric maximization. In parametric\nsituations, an agent can never be made worse off by having more\noptions. (Even if a new option is worse than the options with which\nshe began, she can just ignore it.) But where circumstances are\nnon-parametric, one agent\u2019s strategy can be influenced in\nanother\u2019s favour if options are visibly restricted.\nCortez\u2019s burning of his boats (see\n Section 1)\n is, of course, an instance of this, one which serves to make the\nusual metaphor literal.\n\nAnother example will illustrate this, as well as the applicability of\nprinciples across game-types. Here we will build an imaginary\nsituation that is not a PD\u2014since only one player has an\nincentive to defect\u2014but which is a social dilemma insofar as its\nNE in the absence of commitment is Pareto-inferior to an outcome that\nis achievable with a commitment device. Suppose that two of\nus wish to poach a rare antelope from a national park in order to sell\nthe trophy. One of us must flush the animal down towards the second\nperson, who waits in a blind to shoot it and load it onto a truck. You\npromise, of course, to share the proceeds with me. However, your\npromise is not credible. Once you\u2019ve got the buck, you have no\nreason not to drive it away and pocket the full value from it. After\nall, I can\u2019t very well complain to the police without getting\nmyself arrested too. But now suppose I add the following opening move\nto the game. Before our hunt, I rig out the truck with an alarm that\ncan be turned off only by punching in a code. Only I know the code. If\nyou try to drive off without me, the alarm will sound and we\u2019ll\nboth get caught. You, knowing this, now have an incentive to wait for\nme. What is crucial to notice here is that you prefer that I\nrig up the alarm, since this makes your promise to give me my share\ncredible. If I don\u2019t do this, leaving your promise\nincredible, we\u2019ll be unable to agree to try the crime\nin the first place, and both of us will lose our shot at the profit\nfrom selling the trophy. Thus, you benefit from my preventing you from\ndoing what\u2019s optimal for you in a subgame.\n\nWe may now combine our analysis of PDs and commitment devices in\ndiscussion of the application that first made game theory famous\noutside of the academic community. The nuclear stand-off between the\nsuperpowers during the Cold War was intensively studied by the first\ngeneration of game theorists, many of whom received direct or indirect\nfunding support from the US military.\n Poundstone 1992\n provides the relatively \u2018sanitized\u2019 history of this\ninvolvement that has long been available to the casual historian who\nrelies on secondary sources in addition to theorists\u2019 public\nreminiscences. Recently, a more skeptically alert and professional\nhistorical study has been produced by\n Amadae (2016),\n which provides scholarly context for the still more hair-raising\nmemoir of a pioneer of applied game theory, participant in the\ndevelopment of Cold War nuclear strategy, and famous leaker of the\nPentagon\u2019s secret files on the Vietnam War, Daniel Ellsberg\n (Ellsberg 2017).\n History consistent with these accounts but stimulating less pupil\ndilation in the reader is\n Erickson (2015).\n \n\nIn the conventional telling of the tale, the nuclear stand-off between\nthe USA and the USSR attributes the following policy to both parties.\nEach threatened to answer a first strike by the other with a\ndevastating counter-strike. This pair of reciprocal strategies, which\nby the late 1960s would effectively have meant blowing up the world,\nwas known as \u2018Mutually Assured Destruction\u2019, or\n\u2018MAD\u2019. Game theorists at the time objected that MAD was\nmad, because it set up a PD as a result of the fact that the\nreciprocal threats were incredible. The reasoning behind this\ndiagnosis went as follows. Suppose the USSR launches a first strike\nagainst the USA. At that point, the American President finds his\ncountry already destroyed. He doesn\u2019t bring it back to life by\nnow blowing up the world, so he has no incentive to carry out his\noriginal threat to retaliate, which has now manifestly failed to\nachieve its point. Since the Russians can anticipate this, they should\nignore the threat to retaliate and strike first. Of course, the\nAmericans are in an exactly symmetric position, so they too should\nstrike first. Each power recognizes this incentive on the part of the\nother, and so anticipates an attack if they don\u2019t rush to\npreempt it. What we should therefore expect, because it is the only NE\nof the game, is a race between the two powers to be the first to\nattack. The clear implication is the destruction of the world.\n\nThis game-theoretic analysis caused genuine consternation and fear on\nboth sides during the Cold War, and is reputed to have produced some\nstriking attempts at setting up strategic commitment devices. Some\nanecdotes, for example, allege that President Nixon had the CIA try to\nconvince the Russians that he was insane or frequently drunk, so that\nthey\u2019d believe that he\u2019d launch a retaliatory strike even\nwhen it was no longer in his interest to do so. Similarly, the Soviet\nKGB is sometimes claimed, during Brezhnev\u2019s later years, to to\nhave fabricated medical reports exaggerating the extent of his\nsenility with the same end in mind. Even if these stories aren\u2019t\ntrue, their persistent circulation indicates understanding of the\nlogic of strategic commitment. Ultimately, the strategic symmetry that\nconcerned the Pentagon\u2019s analysts was complicated and perhaps\nbroken by changes in American missile deployment tactics. They\nequipped a worldwide fleet of submarines with enough missiles to\nlaunch a devastating counterattack by themselves. This made the\nreliability of the US military communications network less\nstraightforward, and in so doing introduced an element of\nstrategically relevant uncertainty. The President probably could be\nless sure to be able to reach the submarines and cancel their orders\nto attack if prospects of American survival had become hopeless. Of\ncourse, the value of this in breaking symmetry depended on the\nRussians being aware of the potential problem. In Stanley\nKubrick\u2019s classic film Dr. Strangelove, the world is\ndestroyed by accident because the Soviets build a doomsday machine\nthat will automatically trigger a retaliatory strike regardless of\ntheir leadership\u2019s resolve to follow through on the implicit MAD\nthreat but then keep it a secret. As a result, when an\nunequivocally mad American colonel launches missiles at Russia on his\nown accord, and the American President tries to convince his Soviet\ncounterpart that the attack was unintended, the latter sheepishly\ntells him about the secret doomsday machine. Now the two leaders can\ndo nothing but watch in dismay as the world is blown up due to a\ngame-theoretic mistake.\n\nThis example of the Cold War standoff, while famous and of\nconsiderable importance in the history of game theory and its popular\nreception, relied at the time on analyses that weren\u2019t very\nsubtle. The military game theorists were almost certainly mistaken to\nthe extent that they modeled the Cold War as a one-shot PD in the\nfirst place. For one thing, the nuclear balancing game was enmeshed in\nlarger global power games of great complexity. For another, it is far\nfrom clear that, for either superpower, annihilating the other while\navoiding self-annihilation was in fact the highest-ranked outcome. If\nit wasn\u2019t, in either or both cases, then the game wasn\u2019t a\nPD. A cynic might suggest that the operations researchers on both\nsides were playing a cunning strategy in a game over funding, one that\ninvolved them cooperating with one another in order to convince their\npoliticians to allocate more resources to weapons. \n\nIn more mundane circumstances, most people exploit a ubiquitous\ncommitment device that Adam Smith long ago made the centerpiece of his\ntheory of social order: the value to people of their own\nreputations. Even if I am secretly stingy, I may wish to\ncause others to think me generous by tipping in restaurants, including\nrestaurants in which I never intend to eat again. The more I do this\nsort of thing, the more I invest in a valuable reputation which I\ncould badly damage through a single act of obvious, and observed,\nmean-ness. Thus my hard-earned reputation for generosity functions as\na commitment mechanism in specific games, itself enforcing continued\nre-investment. In time, my benevolence may become habitual, and\nconsequently insensitive to circumstantial variations, to the point\nwhere an analyst has no remaining empirical justification for\ncontinuing to model me as having a preference for stinginess. There is\na good deal of evidence that the hyper-sociality of humans is\nsupported by evolved biological dispositions (found in most but not\nall people) to suffer emotionally from negative gossip and the fear of\nit. People are also naturally disposed to enjoy gossiping,\nwhich means that punishing others by spreading the news when their\ncommitment devices fail is a form of social policing they don\u2019t\nfind costly and happily take up. A nice feature of this form of\npunishment is that it can, unlike (say) hitting people with sticks, be\nwithdrawn without leaving long-term damage to the punished. This is a\nhappy property of a device that has as its point the maintenance of\nincentives to contribute to joint social projects; collaboration is\ngenerally more fruitful with team-mates whose bones aren\u2019t\nbroken. Thus forgiveness conventions also play a strategic role in\nthis elegant commitment mechanism that natural selection built for us.\nA \u2018forgiveness convention\u2019 is itself an instance of a\nnorm, as discussed in\n Section 4,\n and a community\u2019s norms provide crucial social scaffolding for\nreputation management. As an approximate generalization, people as\nthey move into adulthood choose between investments in one of three\nbroad kinds of reputational profiles: (i) upholder of most majority\nnorms (which may involve preference falsification), (ii)\ndiscriminating upholder of mixes of majority and novel, minority norms\n(a \u2018trendsetter\u2019, to use the terminology of\n Bicchieri (2017)),\n or (iii) individualistic rebel. People tend to find all three of\nthese normative personality types decipherable, which is the crucial\nrequirement for a useful reputation. The idea of a useful\nreputation should be distinguished from the idea of a generally\napproved reputation. Trendsetters and rebels are typically widely\ndisapproved of, but this can itself help them to avoid games in which\nthey would have to choose between undermining their reputations and\nearning low material payoffs; social disapprobation typically helps\ntrendsetters and rebels coordinate with one another.\nReligious stories, or philosophical ones involving Kantian moral\n\u2018rationality\u2019, are especially likely to be told in\nexplanation of norms because the underlying game-theoretic basis\ndoesn\u2019t occur to people; and the norms in question may function\nto support reputations more effectively for that very reason, because\nthe religious or philosophical stories hide the extent to which\nreputations are under individuals\u2019 strategic control.\n(Existentialist philosophers call this mechanism \u2018bad\nfaith\u2019). The stories trigger sincere emotions, particularly\nanger, which are direct commitment mechanisms that mutually reinforce\nthe investment value of reputations.\n\nThough the so-called \u2018moral emotions\u2019are extremely useful\nfor maintaining commitment, they are not necessary for it. Larger\nhuman institutions are, famously, highly morally obtuse; however,\ncommitment is typically crucial to their functional logic. For\nexample, a government tempted to negotiate with terrorists to secure\nthe release of hostages on a particular occasion may commit to a\n\u2018line in the sand\u2019 strategy for the sake of maintaining a\nreputation for toughness intended to reduce terrorists\u2019\nincentives to launch future attacks. A different sort of example is\nprovided by Qantas Airlines of Australia. Qantas has never suffered a\nfatal accident, and for a time (until it suffered some embarrassing\nnon-fatal accidents to which it likely feared drawing attention) made\nmuch of this in its advertising. This means that its planes, at least\nduring that period, probably were safer than average even if\nthe initial advantage was merely a bit of statistical good fortune,\nbecause the value of its ability to claim a perfect record rose the\nlonger it lasted, and so gave the airline continuous incentives to\nincur greater costs in safety assurance. It likely still has incentive\nto take extra care to prevent its record of fatalities from crossing\nthe magic reputational line between 0 and 1.\n\nCertain conditions must hold if reputation effects are to underwrite\ncommitment. A person\u2019s reputation can have a standing value\nacross a range of games she plays, but in that case her concern for\nits value should be factored into payoffs in specifying each specific\ngame into which she enters. Reputation can be built up\nthrough play of a game only in a case of a repeated game.\nThen the value of the reputation must be greater to its cultivator\nthan the value to her of sacrificing it in any particular\nround of the repeated game. Thus players may establish commitment by\nreducing the value of each round so that the temptation to defect in\nany round never gets high enough to constitute a hard-to-resist\ntemptation. For example, parties to a contract may exchange their\nobligations in small increments to reduce incentives on both sides to\nrenege. Thus builders in construction projects may be paid in weekly\nor monthly installments. Similarly, the International Monetary Fund\noften dispenses loans to governments in small tranches, thereby\nreducing governments\u2019 incentives to violate loan conditions once\nthe money is in hand; and governments may actually prefer such\narrangements in order to remove domestic political pressure for\nnon-compliant use of the money. Of course, we are all familiar with\ncases in which the payoff from a defection in a current round becomes\ntoo great relative to the longer-run value of reputation to future\ncooperation, and we awake to find that the society treasurer has\nabsconded overnight with the funds. Commitment through concern for\nreputation is the cement of society, but any such natural bonding\nagent will be far from perfectly effective.\n",
