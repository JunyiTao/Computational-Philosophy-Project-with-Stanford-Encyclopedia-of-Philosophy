    "main_text": "Medicine and the Doubts\n4. Medicine and the Doubts\n\nAs yet, al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s extensive medical corpus has barely\nbeen explored with a view to its philosophical significance. An\naccount of the human body and its primary organs in the Spiritual\nLife\u2014here ascribed to Plato\u2014echoes what he says on\nthis topic in medical works (Adamson 2021: 57\u201358). His view,\nfollowing both Galen and the Timaeus, is that humans have\nthree general powers or faculties (quwan), the rational,\nanimal or irascible, and vegetative or desiderative, associated\nrespectively with the brain, heart, and liver. The rational soul is\nnot really seated in the brain, as the other two faculties are seated\nin their organs; it uses the brain only as an instrument. In medical\ncontexts al-R\u0101z\u012b makes the same three organs to be the seats\nof these powers, albeit that the power in the brain is instead called\n\u201cpsychic (nafs\u0101n\u012b)\u201d, perhaps to\nacknowledge the fact that its powers of voluntary self-motion and\nsensation also belong to irrational animals.\n\nAl-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s views on medical epistemology are also\nGalenic, and presuppose that the best doctor should understand the\nhuman body at a theoretical level while also drawing on a wealth of\nexperience (Pormann 2008). This provides a methodological context for\nunderstanding the aforementioned Comprehensive Book, which as\nmentioned collects book-learning on medical theory, but uses\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s own empirical observations to confirm or\ndisconfirm those theories.\n\nBut the most rewarding medical text for philosophical readers is\nDoubts about Galen. Or rather, it should be said that this\nwork deals with a range of philosophical, as well as medical, issues,\nincluding the relation between soul and body, vision, atomism, and\npleasure (see the ample introduction by Koetschet in\nal-R\u0101z\u012b, DG). Regarding the first of these issues,\nal-R\u0101z\u012b criticizes Galen for suggesting that the soul is\nentirely dependent on bodily states or \u201ctemperament\u201d, that\nis, the mixture of the body\u2019s constituents. As in the\nSpiritual Medicine, he defends Plato\u2019s idea that the\nrational part of the soul only uses the brain as an \u201cinstrument\n(\u0101la)\u201d, and that injury to the brain impedes\nrational function only in the way that damage to a flute would make it\nharder for the flute player to perform (al-R\u0101z\u012b, DG:\n\u00a721.4). When it comes to vision, al-R\u0101z\u012b strikes a less\nPlatonist note, since he rejects Galen\u2019s\n\u201cextramissionist\u201d theory, which is in part inspired by\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus. According to Galen, spirit\n(pneuma) is sent forth from the eyes and transforms air,\nmaking it into an instrument for contacting the visual object\n(Ierodiakonou 2014). Instead, al-R\u0101z\u012b defends the view that\nincorporeal images are sent from the seen object and arrive at the eye\n(Koetschet 2017a).\n\nOne of the more elaborate philosophical discussions in the Doubts\nabout Galen comes early in the work, and is devoted to the\neternity of the world (this section is translated in PWL).\nAl-R\u0101z\u012b here takes issue with Galen\u2019s suggestion that\nempirical observation shows that the world was not created after not\nexisting. Galen\u2019s idea, based on a passage in Aristotle (On\nthe Heavens 1.3, 270b11\u201316), is that the universe seems to\nbe unchanging in its general features. If it is unchanging then it is\nnot liable to corruption, and what is incorruptible is also\nungenerable. Thus the universe has always existed, and always will.\nAl-R\u0101z\u012b has little difficulty poking holes in this argument:\nhe points out that the universe could be unchanging for a long time,\nand then be destroyed all at once, like a glass being smashed or a\nbuilding collapsing when previously solid ground under it gives way\n(al-R\u0101z\u012b, DG: \u00a72.3). Furthermore, the incorruptibility\nof the universe would not be guaranteed by its lacking a natural\ntendency to decay. One also needs to rule out that there is some\nexternal cause that could destroy it (al-R\u0101z\u012b, DG:\n\u00a72.5). As often in the Doubts, al-R\u0101z\u012b is here\nnot trying to show that Galen\u2019s conclusion is wrong\u2014though\nin this case, we know that he thinks it is wrong\u2014but that the\nargument offered for the conclusion is not sufficient. Ironically,\nthis seems to be in accord with Galen\u2019s own original intention.\nGalen\u2019s argument is taken from his On Demonstration and\nwas actually offered as an example of a proof that is not\ndemonstrative (Koetschet 2015). Al-R\u0101z\u012b is either being\nremarkably contentious, or has lost sight of the context of the\nargument: he even accuses Galen of being inconsistent, as he elsewhere\nstates that it cannot be proven whether or not the universe is\neternal.\n",
