    "main_text": "The End of Human Life\n7. Reception History and Influence\n\n\nOne of the most surprising features concerning the reception history\nof the Dialoghi is that a work of Jewish philosophy would\nsubsequently become a European bestseller among non-Jews. In the\nyears immediately following its Italian publication, the\nDialoghi was translated into virtually every European\nvernacular. This popularity might be the result of the prominent\nrole that grace (grazia) plays in the Dialoghi or the\nfact that Judah frequently stresses the interlocking relationship\nbetween the corporeal and the spiritual, something that seems to have\nresonated with contemporaneous Christian treatments of the incarnation\nin literary\n fiction.[67]\n\n\nThis popularity of the work has led some to posit that Judah\nAbrabanel\u2019s thought is epigonic, responsible for disseminating\nthe thought of \u201cgreat thinkers\u201d such as Marsilio Ficino\n(1433\u20131499) and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463\u20131494) to a wider\naudience. This essay\u2019s point of departure, however, has\nbeen that the thought of Judah Abrabanel, while dependent upon certain\nfeatures of these earlier thinkers, nevertheless makes significant\ndepartures from them in terms of his construction of an overarching\nsystem that revolves around the twin principles of love and beauty\n\n\nParadoxically, the initial response of Jews to the Dialoghi\nwas for the most part negative. Some of the earliest criticisms,\nespecially those of Saul ha-Kohen Ashkenazi, fault Judah with\nrationalizing kabbalistic principles. Ashkenazi, in a letter to\nDon Isaac Abrabanel, criticizes Judah for his lack of philosophical\nesotericism, and for spending too much time on linguistic matters, such\nas riddles and eloquence. Such antagonism reflects the broader\ncontext of the Maimonidean controversies, in which philosophers sought\nto make philosophy known to a broader Jewish public often by means of\ndramatic dialogues or philosophical novels. Those opposed to the\nAristotelian-Maimonidean paradigm of philosophy often blamed such\ntreatises for weakening the faith of Jews by diminishing their\ncommitment to the halakhah (law) and, thus, making them more\nsusceptible to conversion.   Despite such initial criticisms,\nhowever, subsequent generations stressed the interrelationship between\nPlatonism and kabbalah on the one hand, and philosophy and aesthetics\non the other. Notable individuals include Azariah de Rossi (d.\nca. 1578) and Judah Moscato (d. ca. 1594).\n\n\nThe actual influence that the Dialoghi would have on\nsubsequent thinkers is more difficult to judge. Essentially,\nJudah adopted certain trajectories of medieval cosmology and\npsychology, combined them with Renaissance notions of beauty, and\nthereby created a full-blown aesthetics of Judaism. This led him\nto conceive of the universe as a living, dynamic structure, in which\nall levels share in a symbiotic and organic relationship. Unlike\nmany of his medieval predecessors, he did not define this world, the\nworld of form and matter, in terms of privation or its distance from\nthe divine. On the contrary, he envisages this world as the arena\nwherein individuals encounter, through sensual particulars, the beauty\nand love of the divine.   Abrabanel\u2019s emphasis, like\nthat of many of his Renaissance contemporaries, on aesthetics and the\nphenomenal world would eventually become an important dimension of\n16th- and 17th -century natural philosophy. We do know, for\nexample, that Baruch Spinoza had a copy of the Dialoghi in his\nlibrary.\n",
