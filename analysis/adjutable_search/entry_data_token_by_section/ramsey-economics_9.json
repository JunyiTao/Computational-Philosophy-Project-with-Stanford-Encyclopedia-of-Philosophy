    "main_text": "The Ramsey Rule and Its Ramifications || The Variational Argument\n4.1 The Variational Argument\n\n\nWrite \\(dU/dC = U_C\\) and \\(d^2 U/dC^2 = U_{CC}.\\) Let \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) be\na feasible consumption stream. We first deduce a formal expression for\nthe marginal rate of ethically indifferent substitution between\nconsumption at any two brief periods of time. Suppose the intention is\nto reduce consumption at some future date \\(t\\) by a small quantity\n\\(\\Delta C(t)\\) and raise consumption at a nearby date \\(t+\\Delta t\\)\nwhile keeping consumption at all other dates the same as in\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\). The loss in well-being that would follow from the move\nis \\(e^{-\\delta t}U_{C(t)}\\Delta C(t)\\).  We now seek to\ndetermine the percentage increase in consumption that would be\nrequired at \\(t+\\Delta t\\) if \\(V(0)\\) is to remain unchanged; because\nthat\u2019s the marginal rate of ethically indifferent substitution\nbetween consumption at \\(t\\) and consumption at \\(t+\\Delta t\\). Denote\nthat rate by \\(\\varrho(t)\\). Then \\(\\varrho(t)\\) must be the\npercentage rate at which discounted marginal well-being declines at\n\\(t\\). It also follows that \\(\\varrho(t)\\) is the rate the DM at \\(t =\n0\\) would use to discount a unit of consumption at \\(t\\) so as to\nbring it to the present (because that\u2019s what is meant by the\npercentage rate at which discounted marginal well-being declines at\n\\(t\\) \u2013 for a formal demonstration, see Dasgupta, 2008). Some\neconomists call \\(\\varrho(t)\\) the consumption rate of\ninterest (Little and Mirrlees 1974), others call it\nthe social rate of discount (Arrow and Kurz\n1970). \\(\\varrho(t)\\) is a fundamental object in social cost-benefit\nanalysis.\n\n\nLet \\(\\Delta\\) be vanishingly small. Then, by definition\n\n\\[\\tag{7}\n\\varrho(t) = - [d(e^{-\\delta t}U_{C(t)})/dt]/e^{-\\delta t}U_{C(t)}\n\\]\n\n\n\nSo as to simplify the notation let \\(g(C(t))\\) denote the percentage\nrate of growth in \\(C(t)\\) (i.e. \\(g(C(t)) = [dC(t)/dt]/C(t)\\), which\ncan be negative), and let \\(\\sigma(C)\\) denote the elasticity of\nmarginal well-being (i.e., \\(\\sigma(C) = -CU_{CC}/U_C \\gt\n0)\\). Equation (7) then simplifies to\n\n\\[\\tag{8}\n\\varrho(t) = \\delta + \\sigma(C(t))g(C(t))\n\\]\n\n\n\nBecause \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) is by assumption the optimum, no feasible\ndeviation from \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) can increase \\(V(0)\\). That means the\nconsumption rate of interest \\((\\varrho(t))\\) must equal the social\nrate of return on investment \\((F_{K(t)})\\) at every \\(t\\). To see\nwhy, suppose in some vanishingly small interval of time \\(F_{K(t)} \\gt\n\\varrho(t)\\).  Then \\(V(0)\\) could be increased by consuming a unit\nless at \\(t\\) and enjoying the return of \\((1+F_{K(t)})\\) soon after.\nAlternatively, if \\(F_{K(t)} \\lt \\varrho(t), V(0)\\) could be increased\nby consuming a unit more at \\(t\\) and reducing consumption soon after\nby an amount equal to the return \\((1+F_{K(t)})\\).  But that means\nthe consumption rate of interest \\(\\varrho(t)\\) equals the social rate\nof return \\(F_{K(t)}\\) along \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) at every date. Using\nequation (8) we have,\n\n\\[\\tag{9}\n\\delta + \\sigma(C(t))g(C(t)) = F_{K(t)}\n\\]\n\n\n\nEquation (9) is the Ramsey Rule. It is a necessary condition for\noptimality in Ramsey Mark III and is unarguably the most\nfamous equation in intertemporal welfare economics. The rule is a\nformal statement of the requirement of \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\), that\nthe marginal rate of substitution between consumption at two nearby\ndates (the left-hand-side of eq. 9) equals the marginal rate of\ntransformation between consumption at those same pair of nearby dates\n(the right-hand-side of eq. (9). It is simple to confirm that equation\n(9) is invariant under positive affine transformations of the\n\\(U\\)-function.\n",
