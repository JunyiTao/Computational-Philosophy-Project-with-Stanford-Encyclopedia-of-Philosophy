    "main_text": "Logic\n3. Logic\n\nTwo definitions emerge for the role of Logic after looking at\nKaspi\u2019s comments:\n\nLogic determines the correctness of our beliefs.  It is not a\nmatter of psychological rules, but of regulative rules that serve as a\nmarker and a guide to the correct way of thinking.\nLogic determines the proper use of the language. This is not a\nmatter of conventional rules that result from the structure of a\ncertain language, but of the rules of a universal syntax that\napplies to all languages. The delineation of the work of logic is\nnothing more than a match between \u201cexternal\u201d and\n\u201cinternal\u201d speech (Sharshot Kesef, p. 1), a\ncommonplace in his philosophical antecedents.\n\n\nKaspi accused his predecessors of misunderstanding Scripture because\nthey had not used logic:\n\nThe truth has evaded some of the commentators in this, and other\nmatters, in many places, for they are ignorant of the science of\nlogic, and even if some of them do know it, they do not remember its\nfoundations when they comment (Commentary on Esther, p. 32).\n\n\nAs noted above, Kaspi himself, wrote a brief compendium on logic\n(\u1e92eror ha-Kesef) in which he summarized what he\nbelieved were important principles for a correct interpretation of\nScripture. He omitted discussion of dialectic, rhetoric, and poetics,\nwhich he considered irrelevant to his task.  His exegesis\napplies various techniques: categorizing genera and species,\ndistinguishing between essential and non-essential qualities,\nasserting the symmetry of relation, understanding the law of\ncontradiction, and recognizing valid and invalid syllogisms, in\naddition to logical fallacies. For example, he criticizes commentators\nwho conclude from the truth of a proposition that its parts are also\ntrue. To illustrate this, he cites the verse \u201cThere was no man\nto till the soil\u201d (Genesis 2:5). This verse does not imply that\nthere were no human beings at the time, a proposition at variance with\nthe Aristotelian thesis (to which Kaspi apparently subscribed) that\nthe world has always existed alongside God.\n",
