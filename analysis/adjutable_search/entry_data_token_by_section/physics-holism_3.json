    "main_text": "Property/Relational Holism\n4. Property/Relational Holism\n\nWhile some form of\n ontological holism\n has occasionally been considered, the variety of metaphysical holism\nmost clearly at issue in quantum mechanics and in gauge theory is\nproperty holism. But to see just what the issue is we need a more\ncareful formulation of that thesis.\n\nFirst the thesis should be contextualized to physical\nproperties of composite physical objects. We are interested\nhere in how far a physical object\u2019s properties are fixed by\nthose of its parts, not in some more general determinationist\nphysicalism. Next, to arrive at an interesting formulation of property\nholism we must accept that this thesis is not only concerned with\nproperties, and not concerned with all properties. The properties of a\nwhole will typically depend upon relations among its proper\nparts as well as on properties of the individual parts. But if we are\npermitted to consider all properties and relations among the\nparts, then these trivially determine the properties of the whole they\ncompose. For one relation among the parts is what we might call the\ncomplete composition relation\u2014that relation among the parts\nwhich holds just in case they compose this very whole with all its\nproperties.\n\nLet us call a canonical set of properties and relations of the parts\nwhich may or may not determine the properties and relations of the\nwhole the supervenience basis. To avoid trivializing the theses we are\ntrying to formulate, only certain properties and relations can be\nallowed in the supervenience basis. The intuition as to which these\nare is simple\u2014the supervenience basis is to include just the\nqualitative intrinsic properties and relations of the parts, i.e., the\nproperties and relations which these bear in and of themselves,\nwithout regard to any other objects, and irrespective of any further\nconsequences of their bearing these properties for the properties of\nany wholes they might compose. Unfortunately, this simple intuition\nresists precise formulation. It is notoriously difficult to say\nprecisely what is meant either by an\n intrinsic property\n or relation, or by a purely qualitative property or relation. And the\nother notions appealed to in expressing the simple intuition are\nhardly less problematic. But, imprecise as it is, this statement\nserves already to exclude certain unwanted properties and relations,\nincluding the complete composition relation, from the supervenience\nbasis.\n\nFinally, we arrive at the following opposing theses:\n\nPhysical Property Determination:\n Every qualitative intrinsic physical property and relation of a set\nof physical objects from any domain D subject only\nto type P processes supervenes on qualitative\nintrinsic physical properties and relations in the supervenience basis\nof their\n basic physical parts\n relative to D and P.\n\n\nPhysical Property Holism:\n There is some set of physical objects from a domain D\nsubject only to type P processes,\nnot all of whose qualitative intrinsic physical properties and\nrelations supervene on qualitative intrinsic physical properties and\nrelations in the supervenience basis of their\n basic physical parts\n (relative to D and \\(P)\\).\n\n\nIf we take the real state of a set of physical objects to be given by\ntheir qualitative intrinsic physical properties and relations, then\nphysical property determination says (while physical property holism\ndenies) that the real state of wholes is determined by the real state\nof their parts.\n\nThere is some residual unclarity in the notion of supervenience that\nfigures in these theses. The idea is familiar enough\u2014that there\ncan be no relevant difference in objects in D\nwithout a relevant difference in their basic physical parts. I take it\nthat the modality involved here is not logical but broadly physical.\nOne might try to explicate the notion of supervenience here in terms\nof models of a true, descriptively complete, physical theory. At issue\nis whether such a physical theory has two models which agree on the\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties and relations of the basic\nparts of one or more objects in D but disagree on\nsome qualitative intrinsic property or relation of these objects.\n\nTeller (1989) has introduced the related idea of what he calls\nrelational holism.\n\nRelational Holism:\n There are non-supervening relations\u2014that is, relations that do\nnot supervene on the nonrelational properties of the relata. (p. 214)\n\n\nWithin physics, this specializes to a close relative of physical\nproperty holism, namely:\n\nPhysical Relational Holism: There are physical relations\nbetween some physical objects that do not supervene on their\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties.\n\n\nPhysical property holism entails physical relational holism, but not\nvice versa. For suppose that F is some qualitative\nintrinsic physical property or relation of one or more elements of D\nthat fails to supervene on qualitative intrinsic\nphysical properties and relations in the supervenience basis of their\nbasic physical parts. We may define a (non-intrinsic) physical\nrelation \\(R_{F}\\) to hold of the basic physical parts of elements of\nD if and only if F holds of\nthese elements. Clearly \\(R_{F}\\) does not supervene on the\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties of these parts. So physical\nproperty holism entails physical relational holism. But the converse\nentailment fails. For let \\(R_{G}\\) be a physical relation that holds\nbetween the basic parts of some elements in D when\nand only when those elements are in the relation \\(S_{G}\\). \\(R_{G}\\)\nmay fail to supervene on the qualitative intrinsic physical properties\nof these basic parts, even though all qualitative intrinsic physical\nproperties and relations of elements of D\n(including \\(S_{G}\\)) supervene on the qualitative intrinsic physical\nproperties and relations of their basic parts.\n\nPhysical relational holism seems at first sight too weak to capture\nany distinctive feature of quantum phenomena: even in classical\nphysics the spatiotemporal relations between physical objects seem not\nto supervene on their qualitative intrinsic physical properties. But\nwhen he introduced relational holism Teller (1987) maintained a view\nof spacetime as a quantity: On this view spatiotemporal relations do\nin fact supervene on qualitative intrinsic physical properties of\nordinary physical objects, since these include their spatiotemporal\nproperties.\n",
