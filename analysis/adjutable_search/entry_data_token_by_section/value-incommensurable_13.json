    "main_text": "Deliberation and Choice || Cyclical Choice\n4.2 Cyclical Choice\n\nOne objection voiced against accounts that permit justified choice\nbetween alternatives that are roughly equal or on a par or between\nincomparable alternatives is that such accounts may justify a series\nof choices that leaves a person worse off. Consider Raz\u2019s\nexample of career choice. Suppose the person chooses the musical\ncareer over the legal career. At a future time, she has the\nopportunity to pursue a legal career that is slightly worse than the\ninitial legal career. Suppose this slightly worse legal career and the\nmusical career are judged roughly equal or on a par. If justified\nchoice permits her to choose either of two alternatives when they are\nroughly equal or on a par, then she would be justified in choosing the\nslightly worse legal career. Similarly, if justified choice does not\nrequire the comparability of alternatives, she could be justified in\nchoosing the slightly worse legal career. Through a series of such\napparently justified choices, she would be left significantly worse\noff in a manner analogous to a \u201cmoney pump\u201d (Chang 1997,\n11).\n\nOne response is to question whether the problem posed by choices of\nthis sort is serious. John Broome, for example, notes that after\nhaving chosen one kind of career, a person may change her mind and\nchoose the kind of career she previously rejected. According to\nBroome, there would be a puzzle only if she did not repudiate her\nprevious choice (2000, 34).\n\nAnother line of response is that the considerations that make some\nalternatives worthy of choice count against the constant switching\namong alternatives envisioned in this objection. First, the constant\nswitching among alternatives is akin to not choosing an alternative.\nIf the alternatives are such that choosing either is better than\nchoosing neither, then the considerations that make the alternatives\nworthy of choice count against constantly switching among them.\nSecond, to switch constantly among careers appears to misunderstand\nwhat makes the alternatives worthy of choice. Not only is pursuing a\ncareer the kind of activity that depends upon continued engagement for\nits success, but it is also the kind of activity that is unlikely to\nbe judged truly successful unless one demonstrates some commitment to\nit. Third, for a career to be considered successful, it may require\nthe chooser to adopt a favorable attitude toward the considerations\nthat favor it over other careers. In turn, when subsequently presented\nwith the choice of a legal career, the considerations favoring it may\nno longer apply to her in the same way as they did before (Hsieh\n2007).\n\nRuth Chang advances a hybrid view on rational choice to meet the\nchallenge of cyclical choice. She distinguishes \u201cgiven\nreasons\u201d from \u201cwill-based\u201d reasons. Roughly put,\ngiven reasons could here be understood as those that are grounded in\nnormative facts while will-based reasons are \u201creasons in virtue\nof some act of the will; they are a matter of our creation. They are\nvoluntarist in their normative source. In short, we create will-based\nreasons and receive given ones.\u201d (Chang 2013, 177). Will-based\nreasons come into play when the given reasons no longer can guide our\nactions. When two alternatives are on a par, given reasons fail to\nguide us and at this stage, will-based reasons can provide guidance\nand guarantee that the agent commits to her choice. Anders Herlitz\n(2019) argues that Chang\u2019s approach and other \u201ctwo-step\nmodels\u201d violate an intuitively plausible constraint on rational\nchoice called Basic Contraction Consistency. By violating this\nconstraint two-step models also allow for money pumps. This could,\nhowever, possibly be avoided by introducing additional formal\nconditions for the second step in the model (Herlitz 2019,\n299\u2013307).\n",
