Simple Versions of the Correspondence Theory\n\n\nThe traditional centerpiece of any correspondence theory is a\ndefinition of truth. Nowadays, a correspondence definition is most\nlikely intended as a \u201creal definition\u201d, i.e., as a\ndefinition of the property, which does not commit its advocate to the\nclaim that the definition provides a synonym for the term\n\u201ctrue\u201d. Most correspondence theorists would consider it\nimplausible and unnecessarily bold to maintain that\n\u201ctrue\u201d means the same as \u201ccorresponds with\na fact\u201d. Some simple forms of correspondence definitions of\ntruth should be distinguished (\u201ciff\u201d means \u201cif and\nonly if\u201d; the variable, \u201cx\u201d, ranges over\nwhatever truthbearers are taken as primary; the notion of\ncorrespondence might be replaced by various related notions):\n\n\n\n(1)\nx is true iff x corresponds to some fact;\n\nx is false iff x does not correspond to any fact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\nx is true iff x corresponds to some state of\naffairs that obtains; \nx is false iff x corresponds to some state of\naffairs that does not obtain.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth forms invoke portions of reality\u2014facts/states of\naffairs\u2014that are typically denoted by that-clauses or by\nsentential gerundives, viz. the fact/state of affairs that snow is\nwhite, or the fact/state of affairs of snow\u2019s being\nwhite. (2)\u2019s definition of falsehood is committed to there\nbeing (existing) entities of this sort that nevertheless fail to\nobtain, such as snow\u2019s being green. (1)\u2019s\ndefinition of falsehood is not so committed: to say that a fact does\nnot obtain means, at best, that there is no such fact, that no such\nfact exists. It should be noted that this terminology is not\nstandardized: some authors use \u201cstate of affairs\u201d much\nlike \u201cfact\u201d is used here (e.g. Armstrong 1997). The\nquestion whether non-obtaining beings of the relevant sort are to be\naccepted is the substantive issue behind such terminological\nvariations. The difference between (2) and (1) is akin to the\ndifference between Platonism about properties (embraces uninstantiated\nproperties) and Aristotelianism about properties (rejects\nuninstantiated properties).\n\n\nAdvocates of (2) hold that facts are states of affairs that\nobtain, i.e., they hold that their account of truth is in effect an\nanalysis of (1)\u2019s account of truth. So disagreement turns\nlargely on the treatment of falsehood, which (1) simply identifies\nwith the absence of truth.\n\n\nThe following points might be made for preferring (2) over (1):\n(a) Form (2) does not imply that things outside the category\nof truthbearers (tables, dogs) are false just because they don\u2019t\ncorrespond to any facts. One might think this \u201cflaw\u201d of\n(1) is easily repaired: just put an explicit specification of the\ndesired category of truthbearers into both sides of (1). However, some\nworry that truthbearer categories, e.g. declarative sentences or\npropositions, cannot be defined without invoking truth and falsehood,\nwhich would make the resultant definition implicitly\ncircular. (b) Form (2) allows for items within the category\nof truthbearers that are neither true nor false, i.e., it allows for\nthe failure of bivalence. Some, though not all, will regard this as a\nsignificant advantage. (c) If the primary truthbearers are\nsentences or mental states, then states of affairs could be their\nmeanings or contents, and the correspondence relation in (2) could be\nunderstood accordingly, as the relation of representation,\nsignification, meaning, or having-as-content. Facts, on the other\nhand, cannot be identified with the meanings or contents of sentences\nor mental states, on pain of the absurd consequence that false\nsentences and beliefs have no meaning or content. (d) Take a\ntruth of the form \u2018p or q\u2019, where\n\u2018p\u2019 is true and \u2018q\u2019\nfalse. What are the constituents of the corresponding fact? Since\n\u2018q\u2019 is false, they cannot both be facts\n(cf. Russell 1906-07, p. 47f.). Form (2) allows that the fact\ncorresponding to \u2018p or q\u2019 is an\nobtaining disjunctive state of affairs composed of a state of affairs\nthat obtains and a state of affairs that does not obtain.\n\n\nThe main point in favor of (1) over (2) is that (1) is not committed\nto counting non-obtaining states of affairs, like the state of affairs\nthat snow is green, as constituents of reality.\n\n\n(One might observe that, strictly speaking, (1) and (2), being\nbiconditionals, are not ontologically committed to anything. Their\nrespective commitments to facts and states of affairs arise only when\nthey are combined with claims to the effect that there is something\nthat is true and something that is false. The discussion assumes some\nsuch claims as given.)\n\n\nBoth forms, (1) and (2), should be distinguished from:\n\n\n\n(3)\nx is true iff x corresponds to some fact that exists; \nx is false iff x corresponds to some fact that does not exist,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich is a confused version of (1), or a confused version of (2), or,\nif unconfused, signals commitment to Meinongianism, i.e., the thesis\nthat there are things/facts that do not exist. The lure of (3) stems\nfrom the desire to offer more than a purely negative correspondence\naccount of falsehood while avoiding commitment to non-obtaining states\nof affairs. Moore at times succumbs to (3)\u2019s temptations\n(1910-11, pp. 267 & 269, but see p. 277). It can also be found in\nthe 1961 translation of Wittgenstein (1921, 4.25), who uses\n\u201cstate of affairs\u201d (Sachverhalt) to refer to\n(atomic) facts. The translation has Wittgenstein saying that an\nelementary proposition is false, when the corresponding state of\naffairs (atomic fact) does not exist\u2014but the German original of\nthe same passage looks rather like a version of (2). Somewhat\nironically, a definition of form (3) reintroduces Plato\u2019s\nproblem of falsehood into a fact-based correspondence theory, i.e.,\ninto a theory of the sort that was supposed to provide an alternative\nsolution to that very problem (see Section 1.2).\n\n\nA fourth simple form of correspondence definition was popular for a\ntime (cf. Russell 1918, secs. 1 & 3; Broad 1933, IV.2.23; Austin\n1950, fn. 23), but seems to have fallen out of favor:\n\n\n\n(4) x is true iff x\ncorresponds (agrees) with some fact; \nx is false iff x mis-corresponds (disagrees) with some fact.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis formulation attempts to avoid (2)\u2019s commitment to\nnon-obtaining states of affairs and (3)\u2019s commitment to\nnon-existent facts by invoking the relation of mis-correspondence, or\ndisagreement, to account for falsehood. It differs from (1) in that it\nattempts to keep items outside the intended category\nof x\u2019s from being false: supposedly, tables and dogs\ncannot mis-correspond with a fact. Main worries about (4) are:\n(a) its invocation of an additional, potentially mysterious,\nrelation, which (b) seems difficult to tame: Which fact is\nthe one that mis-corresponds with a given falsehood?  and: What keeps\na truth, which by definition corresponds with some fact, from also\nmis-corresponding with some other fact, i.e., from being a falsehood\nas well?\n\n\nIn the following, I will treat definitions (1) and (2) as\nparadigmatic; moreover, since advocates of (2) agree that obtaining\nstates of affairs are facts, it is often convenient to\ncondense the correspondence theory into the simpler formula provided\nby (1), \u201ctruth is correspondence to a fact\u201d, at least as\nlong as one is not particularly concerned with issues raised by\nfalsehood.\n",
