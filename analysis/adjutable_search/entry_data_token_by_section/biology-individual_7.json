Groups as Evolutionary Individuals: Superorganisms, Trait Groups, Species, Clades\n\nAs the discussion of evolutionary individuals in\n section 3\n indicated, responses to the question of whether natural selection has\ncreated groups that are themselves biological individuals has been\nimportant to the history of the Focal Question. Groups here might\nrange from temporary dyads of individuals, such as two crickets\nsharing a ride on a leaf (Sober & Wilson 1998), through to\nhigher-level taxonomic groups whose members are largely separated in\nspace and time, such as planktotrophic mollusks (Jablonski 1986,\n1987). One fundamental distinction that emerged with the revival of\ngroup selection, largely through the work of David Sloan Wilson (1975,\n1977, 1980, 1983) and Elliott Sober (D.S. Wilson & Sober 1989;\nSober & Wilson 1994, 1998), is between two sorts of groups:\nsuperorganisms and trait groups.\n\nThe term superorganism was introduced by the entomologist\nWilliam Morton Wheeler in his 1920 essay \u201cTermitodoxa, or\nBiology and Society\u201d, although he had talked of ant colonies as\norganisms as early as his 1911 essay \u201cThe Ant-Colony as an\nOrganism\u201d. Paradigm examples of superorganisms are colonies of\nsocial insects, e.g., Hymenoptera such as ants, wasps, and\nbees, together with the taxonomically distinct termites, which are\ntypically viewed as a special kind of biological individual arising\nfrom the specific genetics and reproductive division of labor in those\ncolonies. \n\nTrait group was introduced by D.S. Wilson, by contrast,\nspecifically to name a type of group that he thought was pervasive in\nnature, one that could be a unit of selection just as individual\norganisms were. The intuitive idea behind a trait group is that\npopulations can feature evolutionarily relevant structure wherein\norganisms belonging to one part of the population are subject to\ncausal influences on fitness that do not extend to the population as a\nwhole. A population of such structured demes would then\nfunction as a metapopulation, with natural selection operating between\nthe trait groups that make up that metapopulation. The individuals in\na trait group could thus be seen as evolutionary individuals, being\nthe agents for evolutionary change over time.\n\nA common two-pronged response to this distinction (e.g., Sterelny\n1996) has been to concede the reality of superorganismic group\nselection (but underscore its rarity) and argue that instances of\ntrait group selection are better described as cases of genic or\nindividual selection relativized to a particular environment,\nwhere part of that environment is composed of other individual\norganisms (see also Okasha 2006, 2018). In effect, this is to\nallow for superorganisms as a special kind of biological individual,\nbut to reject a more expansive conception of evolutionary individual\nat the group level. On this view, eusocial insects may be evolutionary\n(and even physiological) individuals, but trait groups are\nneither.\n\nA distinct pathway taken by appeals to group selection has focused on\nspecies and clade selection, particularly in work by paleobiologists\nand paleontologists (Grantham 1995; see also Doolittle 2017). Clades\nare monophyletic groups of organisms or species, groups defined by an\nancestor and all and only its descendants. Steven Stanley and Stephen\nJay Gould have been two of the most prominent defenders of the idea\nthat there are large-scale patterns of evolutionary change that are\ndue to species of clade selection, and both have done so in part by\nexplicitly developing an extended analogy between individual organisms\nand species (e.g., Stanley 1979: 189; Gould 2002: 703\u2013744).\nAmongst putative examples of clade selection are the evolution of\nplanktotrophic mollusks in the late Cretaceous, being selected for\ngreater geographic dispersal and so longevity (Jablonski 1986, 1987),\nthe evolution of larger body size in males, selected via population\ndensity and geographic range (Brown & Maurer 1987, 1989), and the\nevolution of flowering plants, selected via vector-mediated pollen\ndispersal (Stanley 1981: 90\u201391).\n\nThere is a similar caution in discussions of species or clades as\nevolutionary or physiological individuals as there is with trait\ngroups. One of the chief threads to the debate over species and clade\nselection also parallels that over trait group selection: are species\nor clades themselves really the agents of selection, the units that\nare being selected, or do they simply tag along for the ride, with\nselection operating exclusively on organisms and genes? Elisabeth Vrba\n(1984, 1989; Vrba & Gould 1986), for example, has distinguished\nbetween species sorting and species selection,\narguing that while a sorting of species may be the product of\nevolution by natural selection (see Barker & Wilson 2010), this\noutcome is typically brought about not by species selection but by\nindividual selection. On this view, species or clades may be a\nproduct of natural selection, and so in some sense\nevolutionary individuals, but they are not themselves agents in the\nprocess of natural selection. Rather, they are epiphenomena\nof that process, lacking the kind of agency that full-blown\nevolutionary individuals have.\n\nThe much-discussed claim that species are individuals (Ghiselin 1974;\nHull 1976, 1978), which developed as part of a response to the\nperceived failure of essentialism about species (Barker 2013, Sober\n1980), might be viewed in this same light. The species-as-individuals\nthesis reflects the way in which species were treated within\nsystematics and evolutionary biology not as kinds but instead as\nspatiotemporally restricted lineages, with individual\norganisms as their physical parts (Ereshefsky 1992; R.A. Wilson\n1999b). The species-as-individuals thesis was originally presented and\nseen as making a radical break with previous views of the ontological\nstatus of species, as it implied that biologists and philosophers\nalike had misidentified the basic ontological category to which\nspecies belonged. But over time, both as its proponents have clarified\nwhat the thesis implied (e.g., gravitating to talk of historical\nentities rather than individuals) and as more sophisticated options\nfor defenders of the view that species are kinds were developed (e.g.,\nBoyd 1999, Griffiths 1999, R.A. Wilson 1999a), this radical edge to\nthe thesis has diminished. A now widely accepted insight clarified in\nthe process is that in the case of many species, organisms belong to\nthem (as parts or members) by virtue of their interactions and their\nextrinsic rather than intrinsic properties (Barker 2010; cf. Devitt\n2008). Whether this combats (or instead exemplifies) what the\nhistorian James Elwick has recently called \u201cresilient\nessentialisms\u201d (Elwick 2017; cf. Hull 1965) remains contentious.\n\n\nFinally here, Mariscal and Doolittle (forthcoming) have recently\nsuggested that all of life, i.e., the Last Universal Common Ancestor\nand all of its descendants, is a biological individual in the sense in\nwhich Ghiselin and Hull argued that species were. They take life to be\n\u201ca monophyletic clade that originated with a last universal\ncommon ancestor, and includes all of its descendants\u201d\n(forthcoming: abstract). Complementing this is their adaption of\nEreshefsky\u2019s (1992) eliminative pluralism about living things as\na kind, arguing for eliminativism about living things as a natural\nkind. \n",
