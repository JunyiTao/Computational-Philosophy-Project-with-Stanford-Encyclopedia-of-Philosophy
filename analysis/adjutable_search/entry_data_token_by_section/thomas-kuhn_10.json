    "main_text": "Criticism and Influence || Scientific Change\n6.1 Scientific Change\nIn The Structure of Scientific Revolutions periods of\nnormal science and revolutionary science are clearly distinguished.\nIn particular paradigms and their theories are not questioned and not\nchanged in normal science whereas they are questioned and are changed\nin revolutionary science.  Thus a revolution is, by definition\nrevisionary, and normal science is not (as regards\nparadigms). Furthermore, normal science does not suffer from the\nconceptual discontinuities that lead to incommensurability whereas\nrevolutions do. This gives the impression, confirmed by Kuhn\u2019s\nexamples, that revolutions are particularly significant and reasonably\nrare episodes in the history of science.\nThis picture has been questioned for its accuracy.  Stephen Toulmin\n(1970) argues that a more realistic picture shows that revisionary\nchanges in science are far more common and correspondingly less\ndramatic than Kuhn supposes, and that perfectly \u2018normal\u2019\nscience experiences these changes also.  Kuhn could reply that such\nrevisions are not revisions to the paradigm but to the non-paradigm\npuzzle-solutions provided by normal science.  But that in turn\nrequires a clear distinction between paradigmatic and non-paradigmatic\ncomponents of science, a distinction that, arguably, Kuhn has not\nsupplied in any detail.\nAt the same time, by making revisionary change a necessary\ncondition of revolutionary science, Kuhn ignores important discoveries\nand developments that are widely regarded as revolutionary, such as\nthe discovery of the structure of DNA and the revolution in molecular\nbiology. Kuhn\u2019s view is that discoveries and revolutions come about\nonly as a consequence of the appearance of anomalies. Yet it is also\nclear that a discovery might come about in the course of normal\nscience and initiate a \u2018revolution\u2019 (in a non-Kuhnian\nsense) in a field because of the unexpected insight it provides and\nthe way it opens up opportunities for new avenues of research.  The\ndouble-helical structure of DNA was not expected but immediately\nsuggested a mechanism for the duplication of genetic information\n(e.g. in mitosis), which had enormous consequences for subsequent\nbiological research.\n",
