This lends an air of negative dogmatism to M. However,\nthis is merely stylistic: there is also no doubt that Sextus frequently\nemphasizes in M that we shouldn\u2019t take his arguments\ndogmatically, e.g., at M VII 444; VIII 159, 476 (Frede 1973:\n808), or that the upshot of his argumentation is that one should\nsuspend judgment e.g., M VII 443; VIII 298; IX 137: 191\u20132; X\n168 (Bett 1997: xxix). But there are some passages in \u2018Against\nthe Ethicists\u2019 which are harder, at least at first sight, to\nbring into line with the doctrine of suspension of judgment in\nPH. Sextus stresses in the ethical section of PH III\nthat one should suspend judgment as to whether anything is good or bad\nby nature (e.g., PH III 235), and so it is no surprise that\n\u2018M XI argues for the conclusion that nothing is\nby nature good or bad\u2019 (Bett 1997: xiv)\u2014so much one would\nexpect by way of counterarguments to the Dogmatists\u2019 positive\narguments. But Sextus gets perilously close to saying that the skeptic\nshould embrace the conclusions of these counterarguments (Bett\n1997: xiv): \n\nthe freedom \u2018from the trouble associated with the opinion\nthat something bad or good is present\u2019 will \u2018come to him\nfrom his thinking nothing good or bad by nature\u2019\n(M XI 118; my emphasis);\n\u2018when reason has established that none of these\nthings is by nature good or by nature bad, there will be a release\nfrom disturbance and a peaceful life will await us\u2019 (M\nXI 130; my emphasis);\n\u2018It will only be possible to avoid this [sc. trouble], then,\nif we show to the person who is disturbed on account of his\navoidance of the bad or his pursuit of the good, that there is not\nanything either good or bad by nature\u2019 (M XI 140; my\nemphasis). \n\n\n The way to avoid saddling Sextus with an inconsistency is to\nsee that Sextus is not suggesting that the Skeptic must\nbelieve that nothing is good or bad by nature, but rather that\nthe Skeptic must have equally convincing arguments up his sleeve\nthat conclude that nothing is by nature good or bad\u2014once\nwe have managed that, \u2018there will be a release from disturbance\nand a peaceful life will await us\u2019. (For pushback against this, see Bett 2018: 13n. 24.)\n",
