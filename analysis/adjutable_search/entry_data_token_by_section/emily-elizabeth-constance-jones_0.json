    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nBorn in Wales in 1848, Emily Elizabeth Constance Jones matriculated at\nGirton College, Cambridge University\u2019s newly established\nwomen\u2019s college, in 1875. She studied for the Moral Sciences\nTripos under Henry Sidgwick, James Ward and John Neville Keynes,\nreceiving a \u201cFirst Class\u201d, Sidgwick being among her\nexaminers. (Her brothers\u2019 education took priority over her own,\ndelaying her entry into the academy and occasioning subsequent\ninterruptions.) It was due to the interventions of Sidgwick and Ward\nthat Jones, fluent from childhood in both German and French, was\noffered to complete, upon graduation, the remaining half of a\ntranslation of Hermann Lotze\u2019s massive Mikrocosmos,\nleft unfinished by Elizabeth Hamilton (the recently deceased daughter\nof Sir William Hamilton). Jones later went on to become\nSidgwick\u2019s literary executor. Her research in philosophical\nlogic dates from 1884, when she began her career at Girton College as\nResident Lecturer in Moral Sciences and was called upon to teach\ncourses in logic; she later became Vice-Mistress and, subsequently,\nMistress of Girton. During this period, Jones wrote a number of\nintroductory logic texts, some of which went through several\nprintings. By 1890, in her Elements of Logic as a Science of\nPropositions, whose main philosophical themes are summarized in\n\u201cThe Import of Categorical Propositions\u201d (Jones 1893a),\nshe developed her \u201claw of significant assertion\u201d\u2014the\n\u201cnew law of thought\u201d which would become the focus of her\nsubsequent work in philosophical logic, culminating in the\neponymously-titled monograph, published by Cambridge University Press\nin 1911. During the same period Jones also published numerous papers,\nas well as an introductory text (Jones 1909), in ethics. While her\nwork in this area was primarily devoted to the exposition,\ninterpretation and defense of Sidgwick\u2019s work, she arguably broke\nnew ground in her attempt at resolving Sidgwick\u2019s dualism of\npractical reason. Jones was also a capable administrator. When she\nbecame Mistress of Girton in 1903, the college was \u00a343,000 in\ndebt (equivalent to \u00a35,185,069 in 2020); at the time of her\nretirement in 1916, the debt had been paid off and funds had been\nraised to finance several fellowships. Her death in 1922 was marked by\nthe appearance of substantial obituaries in Mind,\nProceedings of the Aristotelian Society and The\nInternational Journal of Ethics (now Ethics).\n",
