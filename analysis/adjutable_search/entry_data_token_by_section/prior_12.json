    "main_text": "Life and Philosophical Development || Personal Courage, Bleak Times\n3.5 Personal Courage, Bleak Times\n\n\nDuring the first months of 1940 Prior worked on what he described as\n\u2018a large book, on \u201cThe Theology of the Church of\nScotland\u201d\u2019. Life in London went on almost normally during\nthis time of Phoney War, but the situation worsened dramatically after\nthe fall of France in June. A German invasion of Britain seemed\nimminent. Chillingly, Winston Churchill warned of the coming fighting\n\u2018in the fields and in the streets\u2019 (Churchill 1940/2007).\nFor the Priors, it was time to go home.\n\n\nOnce back on New Zealand soil, Prior met with criticism and\nhostility for failing to stay and play his part in the war. But the\njourney home was certainly no cowardly retreat: more than 12,000 miles\nof unfriendly ocean lay between the Priors and New Zealand. At the\nbeginning of August 1940, in Glasgow, they boarded an armed New Zealand\nliner, the MV Rangitiki, bound for Wellington via the Panama\nCanal. Their route lay across the North Atlantic, where German\nsubmarines and aircraft had sunk a total of 81 civilian vessels during\nthe preceding two months, with a further 144 civilian vessels going\ndown in British coastal waters in the same period (Roskill 1954). There\nwere also armed German surface vessels preying on shipping in the\nwaters around New Zealand, even laying minefields in the approaches\n(Waters 1956). During June\u2013August these armed raiders sank\nseveral defenceless ships close to New Zealand\u2014news that, like\nnews of the Atlantic sinkings, could hardly have failed to reach the\nPriors. All in all, it must have been a nerve-racking journey.\n\n\nLuckily the voyage passed without incident, and in September the\nPriors disembarked from the Rangitiki in Wellington. The ship\nwas not so fortunate on her return journey to England, when she was\nattacked by a German battleship in the North Atlantic\u2014in the same\nmonth that her sister liner the Rangitane was sunk while also\nen route from New Zealand to the UK. It had been a narrow escape for\nthe Priors. As they started to pick up the threads of life in\nWellington, the Luftwaffe\u2019s bombs devastated their previous home\nof Lambeth.\n\n\nThe couple took an apartment in central Wellington, and in October\nArthur started teaching French, English and History at a secondary\nschool in the suburb of Rongotai. He gave this up in March 1941 and the\nPriors returned to Dunedin, joining the household of fellow pacifists\nJack Brailsford and his wife Ruth\u2014Arthur\u2019s \u2018Aunty\nRuth\u2019, who had cared for him when his mother died not long after\nhis birth. Jack, a conscientious objector in the first world war, had\nbeen imprisoned for his pacifism in 1916 and was not released until\njust before the end of the fighting in 1918 (Brodie 1999).\n\n\nIt was while the Priors were living with the Brailsfords that Clare\nfell for their adopted Russian son Victor Roussin\u2014at that time\nknown as Norman Brailsford\u2014and her marriage to Arthur\ndisintegrated. Arthur, who did not want the relationship to end,\neventually fled to Christchurch. The divorce became final in March\n1943. What might have been a lengthy period of sadness for him was cut\nshort in January of that year. He met Mary Wilkinson, the daughter of a\nPresbyterian minister, while attending a Student Christian Movement\nconference in Christchurch. They said afterwards that it was love at\nfirst sight. \u2018We got engaged after meeting four times\u2019,\nMary remembered. The marriage began in October 1943 and lasted for the\nrest of Arthur\u2019s life.\n\n\nDuring 1941 Arthur had come to view his pacifism as untenable,\nthough in December he wrote two letters to the Otago Daily\nTimes defending \u2018liberty of conscience\u2019 and the right\nto be a conscientious objector. In January 1942, while he and Clare\nwere still living with the Brailsfords in Dunedin, Arthur was called\nup, and instead of appealing for conscientious objector status himself,\nhe applied to enlist in the Royal New Zealand Air Force (perhaps\nbecause, under the regulations in force at that time, such an appeal\nwould have required him to say \u2018that it is wrong to engage in\nwarfare in any circumstances\u2019). There is no evidence that\nClare\u2019s pacifism had also weakened, and Arthur\u2019s thinking\nwas manifestly undergoing other fundamental changes at this time. His\nenlistment papers contained the brief but telling entry\n\u2018Religion: Atheist\u2019. It seems that a philosophical and\nspiritual chasm had opened up between him and Clare.\n\n\nThe Air Force finally embraced him in November 1942 and he became a\nwireless mechanic, servicing aircraft radio equipment in New Zealand\nuntil January 1945, when he was posted to the New Hebrides islands (now\nVanuatu), some 2000 miles to the north of New Zealand. There he\nremained until the Pacific war ended, returning to New Zealand in\nOctober 1945.\n",
