Transcendental Arguments in Ethics\n\nAs we have seen, then, when it comes to transcendental arguments in\nepistemology, most of the effort in recent years has been concentrated\nat the meta-level, concerning what transcendental arguments are and\nwhat they can be expected to achieve: when it comes to examples of\ntranscendental arguments themselves, very few new ones have actually\nbeen proposed (for exceptions, see Lockie 2018, Cheng 2022). However,\nthe picture is different in ethics, where attempts to produce such\narguments are still being made, so that while epistemology perhaps\nremains their natural home, the use of transcendental arguments in\nethics is of undoubted significance (see for example Brune, Stern and\nWerner (eds.) 2017). Moreover, as with such arguments in epistemology,\nwhen it comes to transcendental claims in ethics, Kant may again be\ntaken as an important inspiration, especially Kant 1785.\n\nIn fact, in view of what was said previously regarding the problems of\ntranscendental arguments, it is perhaps not really surprising that\nethicists have had fewer qualms in producing them. For, as we saw, the\ndifficulty when it comes to external world scepticism, other minds\nscepticism, and the like, is in finding an argument that will\nsuccessfully cross Stroud\u2019s \u2018bridge of necessity\u2019,\nand establish a conclusion concerning how things are, rather than how\nthings must appear or how we must believe them to be, and so reach a\nconclusion that will satisfy the realist about such matters. However,\nin ethics, it is much more acceptable to reject realism, and to adopt\na more anti-realist position of some sort at the outset (cf.\nR\u00e4hme 2017); as a result, the most that will be called for is a\nmodest transcendental argument which is not world-directed, as many\nethicists do not want to treat moral values and norms as part of the\n\u2018world\u2019 anyway, and so see no victory for the sceptic in\nfailing to establish any more ambitious conclusion, where this may\nstill be a worry in the epistemological cases.\n\nWhile until recently there was only a limited discussion of\ntranscendental arguments in ethics within the \u2018analytic\u2019\ntradition of Anglo-American philosophy (see e.g., Phillips-Griffiths\n1957\u20138; Watt 1975; Harrison 1976; Cooper 1976; Finnis 1977\nargues for the value of truth), they have played a significant role in\nthe social philosophy of thinkers such as Karl-Otto Apel and\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas (for a broader discussion of transcendental\narguments concerning intersubjectivity in the\n\u2018continental\u2019 tradition more generally, see Chase &\nReynolds 2011: 89\u2013114 and Russell & Reynolds 2011). Apel has\nargued that an ethical perspective is required as a condition for a\ncommitment to truth, inquiry and successful communication. Habermas\ndenies this, where instead he thinks that we are committed to\ncommunication and discourse by the pragmatic implications of speech\noriented towards reaching understanding of each other, which for us,\nas speaking beings, is unavoidable. Both may be said to be inspired by\nC. S. Peirce\u2019s insistence on the relation between truth and\nconsensus, where the search for consensus is said to require as a\nnecessary condition that we have certain ethical attitudes to others,\nsuch as equal respect and tolerance for their views and commitments.\nIn this way the suggestion is also made in the practical case, it is\neasier for transcendental arguments to take a so-called\n\u2018retorsive\u2019 rather than a deductive form, aiming to more\nmodestly show that to make inquiries in this context we simply must\nnot question certain things to make inquiries in this context (See\nApel 1976b vol II/1980 and 1976a; Habermas 1983. For further\ndiscussion see Benhabib and Dallmayr (eds.) 1995; Illies 2003:\n64\u201392 and Kuhlmann 2017. A comparable form of transcendental\nargument is attributed to Emmanuel Levinas in Perpich 2008:\n124\u2013149; For a critical discussion of the value of this approach\nsee Stern 2016).\n\nMoreover, transcendental claims have been given a more prominent role\nwithin recent Anglo-American ethical theory, largely through the work\nof Alan Gewirth and Christine Korsgaard. These arguments start not\nfrom claims about truth and communication, but from claims about our\nnature as human agents, and what we must then presuppose about the\nmoral status of ourselves and others. As in epistemology, the promise\nof such arguments in ethics has generated much interest and attention.\nFor illustration, we will discuss a transcendental argument in ethics\nproposed by Korsgaard. (For Gewirth, see Gewirth 1981; Beyleveld 1991;\nand Illies 2003: 93\u2013128.)\n\nKorsgaard\u2019s use of a transcendental argument in fact forms only\npart of a wider response to sceptical worries about the demands of\nmorality (\u2018the normative question\u2019), and is deployed\nmerely to convince the sceptic that her own humanity has value, from\nwhich a further argument concerning the publicity of reasons is used\nto show that she must also then value the humanity of others. The\ntranscendental argument that Korsgaard proposes is modelled on a\nposition which she finds in Kant and which she outlines as\nfollows:\n\n[Kant] started from the fact that when we make a choice we must regard\nits object as good. His point is the one I have been making\u2014that\nbeing human we must endorse our impulses before we can act on them. He\nasked what it is that makes these objects good, and, rejecting one\nform of realism, he decided that the goodness was not in the objects\nthemselves. Were it not for our desires and inclinations\u2014and for\nthe various physiological, psychological, and social conditions which\ngave rise to those desires and inclinations\u2014we would not find\ntheir objects good. Kant saw that we take things to be important\nbecause they are important to us\u2014and he concluded that we must\ntherefore take ourselves to be important. In this way, the value of\nhumanity itself is implicit in every human choice. If complete\nnormative scepticism is to be avoided\u2014if there is such a thing\nas a reason for action\u2014then humanity, as the source of all\nreasons and values, must be valued for its own sake. (Korsgaard 1996:\n122)\n\n\nThis argument can be laid out as follows:\n\n(1) To rationally\nchoose to do X, you must regard doing X as\ngood.\n(2) You cannot regard\ndoing X as good in itself, but can only regard doing\nX as good because it satisfies your needs, desires,\ninclinations, etc.\n(3) You cannot regard\nyour desiring or needing to do X as making it good unless you\nregard yourself as valuable.\n(4) Therefore, you must\nregard yourself as valuable, if you are to make any rational\nchoice.\n\n\nConsider this example. To rationally choose to eat this piece of\nchocolate cake, I must think that eating the cake is good in some way.\nHow can I regard it as good? It seems implausible to say that eating\nthe cake is good in itself, of intrinsic value. It also seems\nimplausible to say that it is good just because it satisfies a desire\nas such: for even if I was bulimic it might do that, but still not be\nregarded as good. A third suggestion, then, is that it can be seen as\ngood because it is good for me, as satisfying a genuine need or desire\nof mine. But if I think this is what makes eating the piece of cake\ngood, I must value myself, as otherwise I could not hold that\nsatisfying me is sufficient to make something good enough for it to be\nrational for me to choose to do it; so I must regard myself as\nvaluable. Put conversely: suppose that you thought that you and your\nlife were utterly worthless, pointless, meaningless\u2014that in your\neyes, you were valueless. And suppose that you are faced with a piece\nof cake: on what basis would you choose it eat it? It seems unlikely\nthat there is something intrinsically good about eating it, or that\nyou should do so just because you find yourself with a desire to do\nso, even while finding your existence valueless. It seems that the\nonly reason to do so would be if you thought eating the cake brought\nyou some genuine benefit\u2014but if you thought your life was\nworthless, how could you see this as a reason either? Why is bringing\nbenefit to something that in your eyes is so utterly without value a\nreasonable thing to do?\n\nThere are some dangers in this argument, however. One, which Korsgaard\nconsiders, is that it might lead to \u2018self-conceit\u2019\n(Korsgaard 1998: 54. Cf. also Korsgaard 1996: 249\u201350): that is,\nI might conclude from this that I am supremely valuable, simply as\nmyself, which could obviously then get in the way of my ethical\ntreatment of others. But, this worry might be lessened by the thought\nthat while the argument gets me to see that I must find something\nvaluable about me, it need not be anything about me in particular, and\nperhaps could instead be something about me that is more\ngeneral\u2014such as my humanity or personhood. However, while\nKorsgaard says that reflection will indeed lead us in this more\ngeneral direction, we will need to see how. A second, perhaps related,\nworry is that this argument has a troubling parallel in the case of\nSatan, where Satan goes through (1) to (4) above, and concludes that\nhe must regard his devilish nature as valuable. If this argument\nsomehow entitles us to regard our own humanity or personhood as\nvaluable, why doesn\u2019t it entitle Satan to think the same about\nhis nature? This is not the same as self-conceit, because he is not\nvaluing himself as Satan just qua Satan; he is valuing his\nnature, just as we are valuing ours. Nor does devilishness seem any\nless central to his nature than humanity is to ours. So it is hard to\nsee how the Satanic parallel can be avoided by the argument as it\nstands.\n\nNonetheless, it is possible that something can be built on the central\nidea of the argument, which seems to be this: As long as we think we\ncan act for reasons based on the value of things, but at the same time\nreject any realism about that value applying to things independently\nof us, then we must be treated as the source of value and in a way\nthat makes rational choice possible. We can therefore see\nKorsgaard\u2019s second argument as attempting something along these\nlines, using her notion of practical identity to perhaps avoid the two\nproblems we have identified with the Kantian argument.\n\nHere, then, is an outline of Korsgaard\u2019s second argument:\n\n(1) To rationally\nchoose to do X, you must take it that doing X is the\nrational thing to do.\n(2) Since there is no\nreason in itself to do X, you can take it that X is\nthe rational thing to do only if you regard your practical identity as\nmaking X the rational thing to do.\n(3) You cannot regard\nyour practical identity as making doing X the rational thing\nto do unless you can see some value in that practical\nidentity.\n(4) You cannot see any\nvalue in any particular practical identity as such, but can regard it\nas valuable only because of the contribution it makes to giving you\nreasons and values by which to live.\n(5) You cannot see\nhaving a practical identity as valuable in this way unless you think\nyour having a life containing reasons and values is\nimportant.\n(6) You cannot regard\nit as important that your life contain reasons and values unless you\nregard your leading a rationally structured life as\nvaluable.\n(7) You cannot regard\nyour leading a rationally structured life as valuable unless you value\nyourself qua rational agent.\n(8) Therefore, you must\nvalue yourself qua rational agent, if you are to make any\nrational choice.\n\n\nThe first step is now familiar: To act is to do or choose something\nfor a reason that may be conscious or uncomscious. The second step is\nbased on Korsgaard\u2019s idea that we have reasons to act because of\nour practical identities (such as one\u2019s identity as a father, or\nlecturer, or Englishman), not because acts have reasons attached to\nthem in themselves. Once again, realists might demur, claiming that\nsome actions are rational things to do, because some things have value\nas such: so, perhaps knowledge is valuable in itself, thereby making\nit rational to seek it. But let us leave such worries aside and assume\nwith Korsgaard that nothing is objectively rational for us to do.\n\nThe third step asks how a practical identity can make something into a\nreason for an agent: how can the fact that I am a father make it\nrational for me to buy my daughter this toy? The thought here is that\nit can only do so if you see value in that identity. Korsgaard\nstresses this when she writes:\n\nThe conception of one\u2019s identity in question here is not a\ntheoretical one, a view about what as a matter of inescapable\nscientific fact you are. It is better understood as a description\nunder which you value yourself, a description under which you find\nyour life to be worth living and your actions to be worth undertaking.\n(Korsgaard 1996: 101)\n\n\nSo, being a father, whether contingently or essentially, gives one no\nreason to be a caring or devoted father of a sort that would have good\nreason to buy a daughter a gift; rather, valuing one\u2019s\nfatherhood does this.\n\nBut (moving on to step (4)), how can I see my particular practical\nidentity as valuable? Korsgaard\u2019s position here is that I cannot\nsee any value in any particular practical identity as such: for, to do\nso would mean being committed to realism, to thinking that being a\nfather, an Englishman, a university lecturer or whatever matters as\nsuch; or (in a way that is in the end equally realist), it matters\nbecause of the intrinsically valuable things it leads you to do. But,\nKorsgaard takes such realist positions to be problematic, and so\nthinks this will not do as an answer.\n\nSo suppose we allow that no particular practical identity can be seen\nto have value in itself; Korsgaard then offers as the only remaining\nexplanation of its value to the agent that has that identity, that\nsuch identities have the general capacity of enabling the agent to\nlive a life containing reasons: because I have whatever particular\npractical identities I do (father, Englishman, university\nlecturer\u2026), I can then find things to be valuable and act\nrationally accordingly, in a way that gives me unity as a subject.\n\nBut then (step (5)), to think that this makes having some sort of\nparticular practical identity important, you must think that it\nmatters that your life have the sort of rational structure that having\nsuch identities provides; but (step (6)), to see that as mattering,\nyou must see value in your leading a rationally structured life. And\nthen, finally, to see value in your leading such a life, you must see\nyour rational nature as valuable, which is to value your humanity.\n\nDoes this Korsgaardian argument avoid the pitfalls of the Kantian one\ndiscussed earlier? It seems to avoid the problem of self-conceit,\nbecause it does seem that what you end up valuing is not yourself\nsimply as such, but yourself qua rational agent. And as\npresented here, it avoids the problem of the Satanic parallel, because\nall it shows is that Satan must value his rational nature, not his\ndevilishness.\n\nFor both these problems to be avoided, however, it is important to run\nthe argument as outlined above, not as it is sometimes presented by\nKorsgaard, which is via the notion of need (cf. Korsgaard 1996: 121\nand 125). This would follow the same premises as before for\n(1)\u2013(5), and then go as follows:\n\n(6*)  You cannot regard\nit as important that your life contain reasons and values unless you\ntake your need to lead this sort of life as important.\n(7*) You cannot take\nthis need to be important unless you take yourself to be\nvaluable.\n(8*) Therefore, you\nmust value yourself, if you are to make any rational\nchoice.\n\n\nThe difficulty with (6*)\u2013(8*), we think, is that (8*) does not\nstipulate what it is about yourself that you are required to value, so\nthat this could be my sheer particularity (self-conceit), or if I am\nnot in fact human, my non-human nature (Satan). This is because (6*)\njust identifies a need, and says that this need could not be important\nunless the agent who has the need were seen to be valuable\nsomehow\u2014whereas the previous argument narrows value down to\nrational agency, and so rules out both self-conceit and\ndevilishness.\n\nWe have therefore reconstructed that part of Korsgaard\u2019s\nstrategy who offers an argument to the effect that you must value\nyour humanity, as a transcendental argument: it is transcendental as\nit claims that valuing humanity is a necessary condition of being an\nagent which makes rational choice. It turns out that if it is to be\nmade plausible in this way, a lot depends on accepting\nKorsgaard\u2019s arguments against realism; but then, as we have\nseen, many have always suspected that some commitment to anti-realism\nis required to make a transcendental argument convincing. A further\nworry when it comes to external world scepticism, as we discussed\nabove\n (\u00a73),\n is that this commitment can appear to make the argument redundant,\nbecause anti-realism appears sufficient as a response to scepticism on\nits own. However, in this ethical case, this worry is perhaps less of\na concern, because a sceptic could endorse an anti-realist position in\nmetaethics, without accepting that they or others have value as a\nmatter of their normative ethics, so that there is still work left for\nthe transcendental argument to do. To this extent, therefore, it is\nnot surprising that Korsgaard\u2019s claims have given further\nimpetus to the debate concerning what transcendental arguments are,\nand what they can contribute. (For further discussion of\nKorsgaard\u2019s position as an interpretation of Kant, see Wood\n1999: 125\u201332 and Timmermann 2006; and for further discussion,\nsee Skorupski 1998, Skidmore 2002, Enoch 2006, Stern 2011, Stern and\nWatts 2019).\n",
