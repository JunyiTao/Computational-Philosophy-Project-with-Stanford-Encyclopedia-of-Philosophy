    "main_text": "Japanese Pure Land Buddhism\u2019s Encounter with Modernity || The Modernization of Buddhist Thought: Intellectual Reform\n5.2 The Modernization of Buddhist Thought: Intellectual Reform\n\nThe Japanese Buddhist response to modernity from the beginning of the\ntwentieth century tended to be dominated by two interrelated trends:\nthe attempt to reinterpret the nature of the Buddhist and Christian\ntraditions and the relationship between them, and the attempt to\nmodernize Buddhist teachings by adopting modes of understanding\nreligious life discerned in Western thought and Christian conceptual\nmotifs.\n\nUntil the latter half of the nineteenth century, there were no terms\nin Japanese corresponding to the abstract categories of\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d and \u201creligion.\u201d Nevertheless, the\nstudy of Western philosophy began to be diligently pursued, even\nbefore the Meiji restoration, as an important body of Western learning\ncrucial for modern Japan, an accompaniment to the natural sciences.\nThe accepted term corresponding to \u201creligion,\u201d\nsh\u016bky\u014d\u5b97\u6559, came into use as the\nstandard equivalent for the Western concept from the 1860\u2019s,\nwhen it was required for the translation of diplomatic documents\nexchanged with Western nations. In terms of actual content, therefore,\nit was at first closely associated with Christianity.\n\nFor Buddhists, philosophy and religion became a means not only to\nposition Buddhism in relation to Christianity, but also to distance it\nfrom Christianity to its own advantage, particularly in relation to\nmodern scientific knowledge. The central figure here was Inoue\nEnry\u014d (1858\u20131919), who was born into the family of a Pure Land\ntemple priest of the Shin Buddhist tradition and was active throughout\nhis life as an educator and public intellectual.\n\nInoue\u2019s strategy was to view Buddhism as a religion in the mode\nof a philosophy. He employed both categories in characterizing the\naims and approach of Buddhism, seeking to demonstrate its superiority\nto Christianity. On the one hand, Buddhism shares the core concern of\nall religion, which is \u201cthe world of the absolute\u201d\n(zettai sekai): \u201cReligion teaches the way for our\nrelative mind to enter into the absolute world. In Buddhism, this is\nnamely the overturning of delusional thought and the awakening of\nenlightenment. Delusional thought indicates the finite, while\nenlightenment signifies the infinite\u201d (Meishin to\nSh\u016bky\u014d [Superstition and Religion], 1916, quoted in\nJosephson 2012, p. 159). On the other hand, when the superstitious\npractices that have attached themselves to Buddhist life are stripped\naway, its fundamental mode of thought, rooted in reason and causality,\nis seen to resemble scientific and philosophical thought. In this, it\nis distinct from Christianity, which Inoue believes is grounded in\nrevelation and divine creation. To counter the notion of creationism\nthat Gordon proposed as the foundation of genuine religion, Japanese\nBuddhists drew on the Western science of evolution as the razor that\nwould shear superstition from a more properly\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d version of religion.\n\nInoue draws on concepts and frameworks that were current in the West\nin the field of \u201ccomparative religion\u201d or the\n\u201cscientific study of religion.\u201d Max M\u00fcller, whose\nthinking informed the spirit of the World\u2019s Parliament of\nReligions in which a number of Japanese Buddhists participated, speaks\nof a human faith in the infinite or absolute within the historical\nworld, and of the \u201cstruggle to conceive the inconceivable\u201d\n(Introduction to the Science of Religions, 1870, quoted in\nKetelaar 1990, p. 146). This language was seen to resonate with the\nBuddhist tradition, providing it with broad categories by which\nJapanese Buddhists were able to situate their traditions in modern,\nphilosophically recognizable frameworks.\n",
