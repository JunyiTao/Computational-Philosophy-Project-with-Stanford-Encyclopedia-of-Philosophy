Goals and Interests\n\nIn one of the most influential papers in the history of research\nethics, Hans Jonas (1969) argues that the progress clinical research\noffers is normatively optional, whereas the need to protect\nindividuals from the harms to which clinical research exposes them is\nmandatory. He writes:\n\n\u2026 unless the present state is intolerable, the melioristic goal\n[of biomedical research] is in a sense gratuitous, and this is not\nonly from the vantage point of the present. Our descendants have a\nright to be left an unplundered planet; they do not have a right to\nnew miracle cures. We have sinned against them if by our doing, we\nhave destroyed their inheritance not if by the time they come around\narthritis has not yet been conquered (unless by sheer neglect). (Jonas\n1969, 230\u2013231)\n\n\nJonas\u2019s view does not imply that clinical research is\nnecessarily unethical, but the conditions on when it may be conducted\nare very strict. This argument may seem plausible to the extent that\none regards, as Jonas does, the benefits of clinical research to be\nones that make an acceptable state in life even better. The example of\narthritis cited by Jonas characterizes this view. Curing arthritis,\nlike curing dyspepsia, baldness, and the minor aches and pains of\nliving and aging, may be nice, but may be thought to address no\nprofound problem in our lives. If this were all that clinical research\nhad to offer, we might be reluctant to accept many risks in order to\nachieve its goals. We should not, in particular, take much chance of\nwronging individuals, or exploiting them to realize these goals.\n\nThis argument makes sense to the extent that one regards the status\nquo as acceptable. Yet, without further argument, it is not clear why\none should accept this view; it seems almost certain that those\nsuffering from serious illness that might be addressed by future\nresearch will not accept it. Judgments regarding the present state of\nsociety concern very general level considerations and a determination\nthat society overall is doing fairly well is consistent with many\nindividuals suffering terrible diseases. Presumably, the suffering of\nthese individuals provides some reason to conduct clinical research.\nIn response, one might understand Jonas to be arguing that the present\nstate of affairs involves sufficiently good medicine and adequately\nflourishing lives such that the needs which could now be addressed by\nadditional clinical research are not of sufficient importance to\njustify the risks raised by conducting it. It might have been the\ncase, at some point in the past, that life was sufficiently nasty,\nbrutish and short to justify running the risk of exploiting research\nparticipants in the process of identifying ways to improve the human\nlot. But, we have advanced, in part thanks to clinical research,\nwell beyond that point. This reading need not interpret Jonas as\nignoring the fact that there remain serious ills to be cured. Instead,\nhe might be arguing that these ills, while real and unfortunate, are\nnot of sufficient gravity, or perhaps prevalence to justify the risks\nof conducting clinical research.\n\nThis view implicitly expands the ethical concerns raised by clinical\nresearch. We have been focusing on the importance of protecting\nindividual research participants. However, Jonas assumes that clinical\nresearch also threatens society in some sense. There are at least two\npossibilities here. First, it might be thought that the conduct of\nunethical research reaches beyond individual investigators to taint\nsociety as a whole. This does not seem unreasonable given that\nclinical research typically is conducted in the name of and often for\nthe benefit of society. Second, one might be concerned that allowing\ninvestigators to expose research participants to some risks for the\nbenefit of others might put us on a slippery slope that ends with\nserious abuses throughout society.\n\nAn alternative reading would be to interpret Jonas as arguing from a\nversion of the active-passive distinction. It is often claimed that\nthere is a profound moral difference between actively causing harm\nversus merely allowing harm to occur, between killing someone versus\nallowing them to die, for example. Jonas often seems to appeal to this\ndistinction when evaluating the ethics of clinical research. The idea\nis that conducting clinical research involves investigators actively\nexposing individuals to risks of harm and, when those harms are\nrealized, it involves investigators actively harming them. The\ninvestigator who injects a participant with an experimental\nmedication actively exposes the individual to risks for the\nbenefit of others and actively harms, perhaps even kills those who\nsuffer harm as a result. And, to the extent that clinical research is\nconducted in the name of and for the benefit of society in general,\none can say without too much difficulty that society is complicit in\nthese harms. Not conducting clinical research, in contrast, involves\nour allowing individuals to be subject to diseases that we might\notherwise have been able to avoid or cure. And this situation, albeit\ntragic and unfortunate, has the virtue of not involving clear moral\nwrongdoing.\n\nThe problem with at least this version of the argument is that the\nbenefits of clinical research often involve finding safer ways to\ntreat disease. The benefits of this type of clinical research, to the\nextent they are realized, involve clinicians being able to provide\nless harmful, less toxic medications to patients. Put differently,\nmany types of clinical research offer the potential to identify\nmedical treatments which harm patients less than current ones. This\nnot an idle goal. One study found that the incidence of serious\nadverse events from the appropriate use of clinical medications (i.e.\nexcluding such things as errors in drug administration, noncompliance,\noverdose, and drug abuse) in hospitalized patients was 6.7%. The same\nstudy, using data from 1994, concludes that the approved and properly\nprescribed use of medications is likely the 5th leading\ncause of death in the US (Lazarou, Pomeranz, and Corey 1998).\n\nThese data suggest that the normative calculus is significantly more\ncomplicated than the present reading of Jonas suggests. The question\nis not whether it is permissible to risk harming some individuals in\norder to make other individuals slightly better off. Instead, we have\nto decide how to trade off the possibility of clinicians exposing\npatients to greater risks of harm (albeit with a still favorable\nrisk-benefit ratio) in the process of treating them versus clinical\nresearchers exposing participants to risk of harm in the process of\ntrying to identify improved methods to treat others. This is not to\nsay that there is no normative difference between these two\nactivities, only that that difference is not accurately described as\nthe difference between harming individuals versus improving their lot\nbeyond some already acceptable status quo. It is not even a difference\nbetween harming some individuals versus allowing other individuals to\nsuffer harms. The argument that needs to be made is that harming\nindividuals in the process of conducting clinical research potentially\ninvolves a significant moral wrong not present when clinicians harm\npatients in the process of treating them.\n\nThe primary concern here is that, by exposing participants to risks of\nharm, the process of conducting clinical research involves the threat\nof exploitation of a particular kind. It runs the risk of\ninvestigators treating persons as things, devoid of any interests of\ntheir own. The worry here is not so much that investigators and\nparticipants enter together into the shared activity of clinical\nresearch with different, perhaps even conflicting goals. The concern\nis rather that, in the process of conducting clinical research,\ninvestigators treat participants as if they had no goals at all or,\nperhaps, that any goals they might have are normatively\nirrelevant.\n\nJonas argues that this concern can be addressed, and the process of\nexperimenting on some to benefit others made ethically acceptable,\nonly when the research participants share the goals of the research\nstudy. Ethically appropriate research, on Jonas\u2019s view, is\nmarked by: \u201cappropriation of the research purpose into the\nperson\u2019s own scheme of ends\u201d (Jonas 1969, 236). And\nassuming that it is in one\u2019s interests to achieve one\u2019s,\nat least, proper goals, it follows that, by participating in research,\nparticipants will be acting in their own interests, despite the fact\nthat they are thereby being exposed to risky procedures which are\nperformed to collect information to benefit others.\n\nJonas claims in some passages that research participants, at least\nthose with an illness, can share the goals of a clinical research\nstudy only when they have the condition or illness under study (Jonas\n1969). These passages reveal something of the account of human\ninterests on which Jonas\u2019s arguments rely. On standard\npreference satisfaction accounts of human interests, what is in a\ngiven individual\u2019s interests depends on what the individual\nhappens to want or prefer, or the goals the individual happens to\nendorse, or the goals the individual would endorse in some idealized\nstate scrubbed clean of the delusions, misconceptions and confusion\nwhich inform their actual preferences (Griffin 1986). On this view,\nparticipation in clinical research would promote an individual\u2019s\ninterests as long as she was well informed and wanted to participate.\nThis would be so whether or not she had the condition being studied.\nJonas\u2019s view, in contrast, seems to be that there are objective\nconditions under which individuals can share the goals of a given\nresearch study. They can endorse the cause of curing or at least\nfinding treatments for Alzheimer disease only if they suffer from the\ndisease themselves.\n\nOne possible objection would be to argue that there are many reasons\nwhy an individual might endorse the goals of a given study, apart\nfrom having the disease themselves. One might have family members\nwith the disease, or co-religionists, or have adopted improved\ntreatment of the disease as an important personal goal. The larger\nquestion is whether participants endorsing the goals of a clinical\nresearch study is a necessary condition on its acceptability. Recent\ncommentators and guidelines rarely, if ever, endorse this condition,\nalthough at least some of them might be assuming that the requirement\nto obtain free and informed consent will ensure its satisfaction. It\nmight be assumed, that is, that competent, informed, and free\nindividuals will enroll in research only when they share the goals of\nthe study in question.\n\nJonas was cognizant of the extent to which the normative concerns\nraised by clinical research are not exhausted by the risks to which\nparticipants are exposed, but also include the extent to which\ninvestigators and by implication society are the agents of their\nexposure to risks. For this reason, he recognized that the libertarian\nresponse is inadequate, even with respect to competent adults who\ntruly understand. Finally, to the extent Jonas\u2019s claims rely on\nan objective account of human interests, one may wonder whether he\nadopts an overly restrictive one. Why should we think, on an objective\naccount, that individuals will have an interest in contributing to the\ngoals of a given study only when they have the disease it addresses?\nMoreover, although we will not pursue the point here, appeal to an\nobjective account of human interests raises the possibility of\njustifying the process of exposing research participants to risks for\nthe benefit of others on the grounds that contributing to valuable\nprojects, including presumably some clinical research\nstudies, promotes (most) individuals\u2019 interests (Wendler\n2010).\n",
