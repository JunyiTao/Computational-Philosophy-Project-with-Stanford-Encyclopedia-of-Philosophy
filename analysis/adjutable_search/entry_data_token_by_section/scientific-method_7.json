    "main_text": "Method in Practice || Creative and exploratory practices\n5.1 Creative and exploratory practices\n\nA problem with the distinction between the contexts of discovery and\njustification that figured so prominently in philosophy of science in\nthe first half of the 20th century (see\n section 2)\n is that no such distinction can be clearly seen in scientific\nactivity (see Arabatzis 2006). Thus, in recent decades, it has been\nrecognized that study of conceptual innovation and change should not\nbe confined to psychology and sociology of science, but are also\nimportant aspects of scientific practice which philosophy of science\nshould address (see also the entry on\n scientific discovery).\n Looking for the practices that drive conceptual innovation has led\nphilosophers to examine both the reasoning practices of scientists and\nthe wide realm of experimental practices that are not directed\nnarrowly at testing hypotheses, that is, exploratory\nexperimentation.\n\nExamining the reasoning practices of historical and contemporary\nscientists, Nersessian (2008) has argued that new scientific concepts\nare constructed as solutions to specific problems by systematic\nreasoning, and that of analogy, visual representation and\nthought-experimentation are among the important reasoning practices\nemployed. These ubiquitous forms of reasoning are reliable\u2014but\nalso fallible\u2014methods of conceptual development and change. On\nher account, model-based reasoning consists of cycles of construction,\nsimulation, evaluation and adaption of models that serve as interim\ninterpretations of the target problem to be solved. Often, this\nprocess will lead to modifications or extensions, and a new cycle of\nsimulation and evaluation. However, Nersessian also emphasizes\nthat\n\n\ncreative model-based reasoning cannot be applied as a simple recipe,\nis not always productive of solutions, and even its most exemplary\nusages can lead to incorrect solutions. (Nersessian 2008: 11)\n\n\nThus, while on the one hand she agrees with many previous philosophers\nthat there is no logic of discovery, discoveries can derive from\nreasoned processes, such that a large and integral part of scientific\npractice is\n\n\nthe creation of concepts through which to comprehend, structure, and\ncommunicate about physical phenomena \u2026. (Nersessian 1987:\n11)\n\n\nSimilarly, work on heuristics for discovery and theory construction by\nscholars such as Darden (1991) and Bechtel & Richardson (1993)\npresent science as problem solving and investigate scientific problem\nsolving as a special case of problem-solving in general. Drawing\nlargely on cases from the biological sciences, much of their focus has\nbeen on reasoning strategies for the generation, evaluation, and\nrevision of mechanistic explanations of complex systems.\n\nAddressing another aspect of the context distinction, namely the\ntraditional view that the primary role of experiments is to test\ntheoretical hypotheses according to the H-D model, other philosophers\nof science have argued for additional roles that experiments can play.\nThe notion of exploratory experimentation was introduced to describe\nexperiments driven by the desire to obtain empirical regularities and\nto develop concepts and classifications in which these regularities\ncan be described (Steinle 1997, 2002; Burian 1997; Waters 2007)).\nHowever the difference between theory driven experimentation and\nexploratory experimentation should not be seen as a sharp distinction.\nTheory driven experiments are not always directed at testing\nhypothesis, but may also be directed at various kinds of\nfact-gathering, such as determining numerical parameters. Vice\nversa, exploratory experiments are usually informed by theory in\nvarious ways and are therefore not theory-free. Instead, in\nexploratory experiments phenomena are investigated without first\nlimiting the possible outcomes of the experiment on the basis of\nextant theory about the phenomena.\n\nThe development of high throughput instrumentation in molecular\nbiology and neighbouring fields has given rise to a special type of\nexploratory experimentation that collects and analyses very large\namounts of data, and these new \u2018omics\u2019 disciplines are\noften said to represent a break with the ideal of hypothesis-driven\nscience (Burian 2007; Elliott 2007; Waters 2007; O\u2019Malley 2007)\nand instead described as data-driven research (Leonelli 2012; Strasser\n2012) or as a special kind of \u201cconvenience\nexperimentation\u201d in which many experiments are done simply\nbecause they are extraordinarily convenient to perform (Krohs\n2012).\n5.2 Computer methods and \u2018new ways\u2019 of doing science\n\nThe field of omics just described is possible because of the ability\nof computers to process, in a reasonable amount of time, the huge\nquantities of data required. Computers allow for more elaborate\nexperimentation (higher speed, better filtering, more variables,\nsophisticated coordination and control), but also, through modelling\nand simulations, might constitute a form of experimentation\nthemselves. Here, too, we can pose a version of the general question\nof method versus practice: does the practice of using computers\nfundamentally change scientific method, or merely provide a more\nefficient means of implementing standard methods?\n\nBecause computers can be used to automate measurements,\nquantifications, calculations, and statistical analyses where, for\npractical reasons, these operations cannot be otherwise carried out,\nmany of the steps involved in reaching a conclusion on the basis of an\nexperiment are now made inside a \u201cblack box\u201d, without the\ndirect involvement or awareness of a human. This has epistemological\nimplications, regarding what we can know, and how we can know it. To\nhave confidence in the results, computer methods are therefore\nsubjected to tests of verification and validation.\n\nThe distinction between verification and validation is easiest to\ncharacterize in the case of computer simulations. In a typical\ncomputer simulation scenario computers are used to numerically\nintegrate differential equations for which no analytic solution is\navailable. The equations are part of the model the scientist uses to\nrepresent a phenomenon or system under investigation. Verifying a\ncomputer simulation means checking that the equations of the model are\nbeing correctly approximated. Validating a simulation means checking\nthat the equations of the model are adequate for the inferences one\nwants to make on the basis of that model.\n\nA number of issues related to computer simulations have been raised.\nThe identification of validity and verification as the testing methods\nhas been criticized. Oreskes et al. (1994) raise concerns that\n\u201cvalidiation\u201d, because it suggests deductive inference,\nmight lead to over-confidence in the results of simulations. The\ndistinction itself is probably too clean, since actual practice in the\ntesting of simulations mixes and moves back and forth between the two\n(Weissart 1997; Parker 2008a; Winsberg 2010). Computer simulations do\nseem to have a non-inductive character, given that the principles by\nwhich they operate are built in by the programmers, and any results of\nthe simulation follow from those in-built principles in such a way\nthat those results could, in principle, be deduced from the program\ncode and its inputs. The status of simulations as experiments has\ntherefore been examined (Kaufmann and Smarr 1993; Humphreys 1995;\nHughes 1999; Norton and Suppe 2001). This literature considers the\nepistemology of these experiments: what we can learn by simulation,\nand also the kinds of justifications which can be given in applying\nthat knowledge to the \u201creal\u201d world. (Mayo 1996; Parker\n2008b). As pointed out, part of the advantage of computer simulation\nderives from the fact that huge numbers of calculations can be carried\nout without requiring direct observation by the\nexperimenter/\u200bsimulator. At the same time, many of these\ncalculations are approximations to the calculations which would be\nperformed first-hand in an ideal situation. Both factors introduce\nuncertainties into the inferences drawn from what is observed in the\nsimulation.\n\nFor many of the reasons described above, computer simulations do not\nseem to belong clearly to either the experimental or theoretical\ndomain. Rather, they seem to crucially involve aspects of both. This\nhas led some authors, such as Fox Keller (2003: 200) to argue that we\nought to consider computer simulation a \u201cqualitatively different\nway of doing science\u201d. The literature in general tends to follow\nKaufmann and Smarr (1993) in referring to computer simulation as a\n\u201cthird way\u201d for scientific methodology (theoretical\nreasoning and experimental practice are the first two ways.). It\nshould also be noted that the debates around these issues have tended\nto focus on the form of computer simulation typical in the physical\nsciences, where models are based on dynamical equations. Other forms\nof simulation might not have the same problems, or have problems of\ntheir own (see the entry on\n computer simulations in science).\n\nIn recent years, the rapid development of machine learning techniques\nhas prompted some scholars to suggest that the scientific method has\nbecome \u201cobsolete\u201d (Anderson 2008, Carrol and Goodstein\n2009). This has resulted in an intense debate on the relative merit of\ndata-driven and hypothesis-driven research (for samples, see e.g.\nMazzocchi 2015 or Succi and Coveney 2018). For a detailed treatment of\nthis topic, we refer to the entry\n scientific research and big data.\n6. Discourse on scientific method\n\nDespite philosophical disagreements, the idea of the\nscientific method still figures prominently in contemporary discourse\non many different topics, both within science and in society at large.\nOften, reference to scientific method is used in ways that convey\neither the legend of a single, universal method characteristic of all\nscience, or grants to a particular method or set of methods privilege\nas a special \u2018gold standard\u2019, often with reference to\nparticular philosophers to vindicate the claims. Discourse on\nscientific method also typically arises when there is a need to\ndistinguish between science and other activities, or for justifying\nthe special status conveyed to science. In these areas, the\nphilosophical attempts at identifying a set of methods characteristic\nfor scientific endeavors are closely related to the philosophy of\nscience\u2019s classical problem of demarcation (see the entry on\n science and pseudo-science)\n and to the philosophical analysis of the social dimension of\nscientific knowledge and the role of science in democratic\nsociety.\n6.1 \u201cThe scientific method\u201d in science education and as seen by scientists\n\nOne of the settings in which the legend of a single, universal\nscientific method has been particularly strong is science education\n(see, e.g., Bauer 1992; McComas 1996; Wivagg & Allchin\n 2002).[5]\n Often, \u2018the scientific method\u2019 is presented in textbooks\nand educational web pages as a fixed four or five step procedure\nstarting from observations and description of a phenomenon and\nprogressing over formulation of a hypothesis which explains the\nphenomenon, designing and conducting experiments to test the\nhypothesis, analyzing the results, and ending with drawing a\nconclusion. Such references to a universal scientific method can be\nfound in educational material at all levels of science education\n(Blachowicz 2009), and numerous studies have shown that the idea of a\ngeneral and universal scientific method often form part of both\nstudents\u2019 and teachers\u2019 conception of science (see, e.g.,\nAikenhead 1987; Osborne et al. 2003). In response, it has been argued\nthat science education need to focus more on teaching about the nature\nof science, although views have differed on whether this is best done\nthrough student-led investigations, contemporary cases, or historical\ncases (Allchin, Andersen & Nielsen 2014)\n\nAlthough occasionally phrased with reference to the H-D method,\nimportant historical roots of the legend in science education of a\nsingle, universal scientific method are the American philosopher and\npsychologist Dewey\u2019s account of inquiry in How We Think\n(1910) and the British mathematician Karl Pearson\u2019s account of\nscience in Grammar of Science (1892). On Dewey\u2019s\naccount, inquiry is divided into the five steps of\n\n\n(i) a felt difficulty, (ii) its location and definition, (iii)\nsuggestion of a possible solution, (iv) development by reasoning of\nthe bearing of the suggestions, (v) further observation and experiment\nleading to its acceptance or rejection. (Dewey 1910: 72)\n\n\nSimilarly, on Pearson\u2019s account, scientific investigations start\nwith measurement of data and observation of their correction and\nsequence from which scientific laws can be discovered with the aid of\ncreative imagination. These laws have to be subject to criticism, and\ntheir final acceptance will have equal validity for \u201call\nnormally constituted minds\u201d. Both Dewey\u2019s and\nPearson\u2019s accounts should be seen as generalized abstractions of\ninquiry and not restricted to the realm of science\u2014although both\nDewey and Pearson referred to their respective accounts as \u2018the\nscientific method\u2019.\n\nOccasionally, scientists make sweeping statements about a simple and\ndistinct scientific method, as exemplified by Feynman\u2019s\nsimplified version of a conjectures and refutations method presented,\nfor example, in the last of his 1964 Cornell Messenger\n lectures.[6]\n However, just as often scientists have come to the same conclusion as\nrecent philosophy of science that there is not any unique, easily\ndescribed scientific method. For example, the physicist and Nobel\nLaureate Weinberg described in the paper \u201cThe Methods of Science\n\u2026 And Those By Which We Live\u201d (1995) how\n\n\nThe fact that the standards of scientific success shift with time does\nnot only make the philosophy of science difficult; it also raises\nproblems for the public understanding of science. We do not have a\nfixed scientific method to rally around and defend. (1995: 8)\n\n\nInterview studies with scientists on their conception of method shows\nthat scientists often find it hard to figure out whether available\nevidence confirms their hypothesis, and that there are no direct\ntranslations between general ideas about method and specific\nstrategies to guide how research is conducted (Schickore & Hangel\n2019, Hangel & Schickore 2017)\n6.2 Privileged methods and \u2018gold standards\u2019\n\nReference to the scientific method has also often been used to argue\nfor the scientific nature or special status of a particular activity.\nPhilosophical positions that argue for a simple and unique scientific\nmethod as a criterion of demarcation, such as Popperian falsification,\nhave often attracted practitioners who felt that they had a need to\ndefend their domain of practice. For example, references to\nconjectures and refutation as the scientific method are abundant in\nmuch of the literature on complementary and alternative medicine\n(CAM)\u2014alongside the competing position that CAM, as an\nalternative to conventional biomedicine, needs to develop its own\nmethodology different from that of science.\n\nAlso within mainstream science, reference to the scientific method is\nused in arguments regarding the internal hierarchy of disciplines and\ndomains. A frequently seen argument is that research based on the H-D\nmethod is superior to research based on induction from observations\nbecause in deductive inferences the conclusion follows necessarily\nfrom the premises. (See, e.g., Parascandola 1998 for an analysis of\nhow this argument has been made to downgrade epidemiology compared to\nthe laboratory sciences.) Similarly, based on an examination of the\npractices of major funding institutions such as the National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF) and\nthe Biomedical Sciences Research Practices (BBSRC) in the UK,\nO\u2019Malley et al. (2009) have argued that funding agencies seem to\nhave a tendency to adhere to the view that the primary activity of\nscience is to test hypotheses, while descriptive and exploratory\nresearch is seen as merely preparatory activities that are valuable\nonly insofar as they fuel hypothesis-driven research.\n\nIn some areas of science, scholarly publications are structured in a\nway that may convey the impression of a neat and linear process of\ninquiry from stating a question, devising the methods by which to\nanswer it, collecting the data, to drawing a conclusion from the\nanalysis of data. For example, the codified format of publications in\nmost biomedical journals known as the IMRAD format (Introduction,\nMethod, Results, Analysis, Discussion) is explicitly described by the\njournal editors as \u201cnot an arbitrary publication format but\nrather a direct reflection of the process of scientific\ndiscovery\u201d (see the so-called \u201cVancouver\nRecommendations\u201d, ICMJE 2013: 11). However, scientific\npublications do not in general reflect the process by which the\nreported scientific results were produced. For example, under the\nprovocative title \u201cIs the scientific paper a fraud?\u201d,\nMedawar argued that scientific papers generally misrepresent how the\nresults have been produced (Medawar 1963/1996). Similar views have\nbeen advanced by philosophers, historians and sociologists of science\n(Gilbert 1976; Holmes 1987; Knorr-Cetina 1981; Schickore 2008; Suppe\n1998) who have argued that scientists\u2019 experimental practices\nare messy and often do not follow any recognizable pattern.\nPublications of research results, they argue, are retrospective\nreconstructions of these activities that often do not preserve the\ntemporal order or the logic of these activities, but are instead often\nconstructed in order to screen off potential criticism (see Schickore\n2008 for a review of this work).\n6.3 Scientific method in the court room\n\nPhilosophical positions on the scientific method have also made it\ninto the court room, especially in the US where judges have drawn on\nphilosophy of science in deciding when to confer special status to\nscientific expert testimony. A key case is Daubert vs Merrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals (92\u2013102, 509 U.S. 579, 1993). In this case,\nthe Supreme Court argued in its 1993 ruling that trial judges must\nensure that expert testimony is reliable, and that in doing this the\ncourt must look at the expert\u2019s methodology to determine whether\nthe proffered evidence is actually scientific knowledge. Further,\nreferring to works of Popper and Hempel the court stated that\n\n\nordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether a\ntheory or technique is scientific knowledge \u2026 is whether it can\nbe (and has been) tested. (Justice Blackmun, Daubert v. Merrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals; see Other Internet Resources for a link to the\nopinion)\n\n\nBut as argued by Haack (2005a,b, 2010) and by Foster & Hubner\n(1999), by equating the question of whether a piece of testimony is\nreliable with the question whether it is scientific as indicated by a\nspecial methodology, the court was producing an inconsistent mixture\nof Popper\u2019s and Hempel\u2019s philosophies, and this has later\nled to considerable confusion in subsequent case rulings that drew on\nthe Daubert case (see Haack 2010 for a detailed exposition).\n6.4 Deviating practices\n\nThe difficulties around identifying the methods of science are also\nreflected in the difficulties of identifying scientific misconduct in\nthe form of improper application of the method or methods of science.\nOne of the first and most influential attempts at defining misconduct\nin science was the US definition from 1989 that defined misconduct\nas\n\n\nfabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other practices that\nseriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the\nscientific community. (Code of Federal Regulations, part 50,\nsubpart A., August 8, 1989, italics added)\n\n\nHowever, the \u201cother practices that seriously deviate\u201d\nclause was heavily criticized because it could be used to suppress\ncreative or novel science. For example, the National Academy of\nScience stated in their report Responsible Science (1992)\nthat it\n\n\nwishes to discourage the possibility that a misconduct complaint could\nbe lodged against scientists based solely on their use of novel or\nunorthodox research methods. (NAS: 27)\n\n\nThis clause was therefore later removed from the definition. For an\nentry into the key philosophical literature on conduct in science, see\nShamoo & Resnick (2009).\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe question of the source of the success of science has been at the\ncore of philosophy since the beginning of modern science. If viewed as\na matter of epistemology more generally, scientific method is a part\nof the entire history of philosophy. Over that time, science and\nwhatever methods its practitioners may employ have changed\ndramatically. Today, many philosophers have taken up the banners of\npluralism or of practice to focus on what are, in effect, fine-grained\nand contextually limited examinations of scientific method. Others\nhope to shift perspectives in order to provide a renewed general\naccount of what characterizes the activity we call science.\n\nOne such perspective has been offered recently by Hoyningen-Huene\n(2008, 2013), who argues from the history of philosophy of science\nthat after three lengthy phases of characterizing science by its\nmethod, we are now in a phase where the belief in the existence of a\npositive scientific method has eroded and what has been left to\ncharacterize science is only its fallibility. First was a phase from\nPlato and Aristotle up until the 17th century where the\nspecificity of scientific knowledge was seen in its absolute certainty\nestablished by proof from evident axioms; next was a phase up to the\nmid-19th century in which the means to establish the\ncertainty of scientific knowledge had been generalized to include\ninductive procedures as well. In the third phase, which lasted until\nthe last decades of the 20th century, it was recognized\nthat empirical knowledge was fallible, but it was still granted a\nspecial status due to its distinctive mode of production. But now in\nthe fourth phase, according to Hoyningen-Huene, historical and\nphilosophical studies have shown how \u201cscientific methods with\nthe characteristics as posited in the second and third phase do not\nexist\u201d (2008: 168) and there is no longer any consensus among\nphilosophers and historians of science about the nature of science.\nFor Hoyningen-Huene, this is too negative a stance, and he therefore\nurges the question about the nature of science anew. His own answer to\nthis question is that \u201cscientific knowledge differs from other\nkinds of knowledge, especially everyday knowledge, primarily by being\nmore systematic\u201d (Hoyningen-Huene 2013: 14). Systematicity can\nhave several different dimensions: among them are more systematic\ndescriptions, explanations, predictions, defense of knowledge claims,\nepistemic connectedness, ideal of completeness, knowledge generation,\nrepresentation of knowledge and critical discourse. Hence, what\ncharacterizes science is the greater care in excluding possible\nalternative explanations, the more detailed elaboration with respect\nto data on which predictions are based, the greater care in detecting\nand eliminating sources of error, the more articulate connections to\nother pieces of knowledge, etc. On this position, what characterizes\nscience is not that the methods employed are unique to science, but\nthat the methods are more carefully employed.\n\nAnother, similar approach has been offered by Haack (2003). She sets\noff, similar to Hoyningen-Huene, from a dissatisfaction with the\nrecent clash between what she calls Old Deferentialism and New\nCynicism. The Old Deferentialist position is that science progressed\ninductively by accumulating true theories confirmed by empirical\nevidence or deductively by testing conjectures against basic\nstatements; while the New Cynics position is that science has no\nepistemic authority and no uniquely rational method and is merely just\npolitics. Haack insists that contrary to the views of the New Cynics,\nthere are objective epistemic standards, and there is something\nepistemologically special about science, even though the Old\nDeferentialists pictured this in a wrong way. Instead, she offers a\nnew Critical Commonsensist account on which standards of good, strong,\nsupportive evidence and well-conducted, honest, thorough and\nimaginative inquiry are not exclusive to the sciences, but the\nstandards by which we judge all inquirers. In this sense, science does\nnot differ in kind from other kinds of inquiry, but it may differ in\nthe degree to which it requires broad and detailed background\nknowledge and a familiarity with a technical vocabulary that only\nspecialists may possess.",
