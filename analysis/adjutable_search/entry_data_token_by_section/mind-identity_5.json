    "main_text": "Type and Token Identity Theories\n6. Type and Token Identity Theories\n\n\nThe notion \u2018type\u2019 and \u2018token\u2019 here comes by\nanalogy from \u2018type\u2019 and \u2018token\u2019 as applied to\nwords. A telegram \u2018love and love and love\u2019 contains only\ntwo type words but in another sense, as the telegraph clerk would\ninsist, it contains five words (\u2018token words\u2019). Similarly a\nparticular pain (more exactly a having a pain) according to the token\nidentity theory is identical to a particular brain process. A\nfunctionalist could agree to this. Functionalism came to be seen as an\nimprovement on the identity theory, and as inconsistent with it,\nbecause of the correct assertion that a functional state can be\nrealised by quite different brain states: thus a functional state might\nbe realised by a silicon based brain as well as by a carbon based\nbrain, and leaving robotics or science fiction aside, my feeling of\ntoothache could be realised by a different neural process from what\nrealises your toothache. \n\n\nAs far as this goes a functionalist can at any rate accept token\nidentities. Functionalists commonly deny type identities. However\nJackson, Pargetter and Prior (1982) and Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson\n(1996) argue that this is an over-reaction on the part of the\nfunctionalist. (Indeed they see functionalism as a route to the\nidentity theory.) The functionalist may define mental states as having\nsome state or other (e.g., carbon based or silicon based) which\naccounts for the functional properties. The functionalist second order\nstate is a state of having some first order state or other which causes\nor is caused by the behaviour to which the functionalist alludes. In\nthis way we have a second order type theory. Compare brittleness. The\nbrittleness of glass and the brittleness of biscuits are both the state\nof having some property which explains their breaking, though the first\norder physical property may be different in the two cases. This way of\nlooking at the matter is perhaps more plausible in relation to mental\nstates such as beliefs and desires than it is to immediately reported\nexperiences. When I report a toothache I do seem to be concerned with\nfirst order properties, even though topic neutral ones.\n\n\nIf we continue to concern ourselves with first order properties, we\ncould say that the type-token distinction is not an all or nothing\naffair. We could say that human experiences are brain processes of one\nlot of sorts and Alpha Centaurian experiences are brain processes of\nanother lot of sorts. We could indeed propose much finer\nclassifications without going to the limit of mere token\nidentities.\n\n\nHow restricted should be the restriction of a restricted type\ntheory? How many hairs must a bald man have no more of? An identity\ntheorist would expect his toothache today to be very similar to his\ntoothache yesterday. He would expect his toothache to be quite similar\nto his wife's toothache. He would expect his toothache to be somewhat\nsimilar to his cat's toothache. He would not be confident about\nsimilarity to an extra-terrestrial's pain. Even here, however, he might\nexpect some similarities of wave form or the like.\n\n\nEven in the case of the similarity of my pain now to my pain ten\nminutes ago, there will be unimportant dissimilarities, and also\nbetween my pain and your pain. Compare topiary, making use of an\nanalogy exploited by Quine in a different connection. In English\ncountry gardens the tops of box hedges are often cut in various shapes,\nfor example peacock shapes. One might make generalizations about\npeacock shapes on box hedges, and one might say that all the imitation\npeacocks on a particular hedge have the same shape. However if we\napproach the two imitation peacocks and peer into them to note the\nprecise shapes of the twigs that make them up we will find differences.\nWhether we say that two things are similar or not is a matter of\nabstractness of description. If we were to go to the limit of\nconcreteness the types would shrink to single membered types, but there\nwould still be no ontological difference between identity theory and\nfunctionalism.\n\n\nAn interesting form of token identity theory is the anomalous monism\nof Davidson 1980. Davidson argues that causal relations occur under the\nneural descriptions but not under the descriptions of psychological\nlanguage. The latter descriptions use intentional predicates, but\nbecause of indeterminacy of translation and of interpretation, these\npredicates do not occur in law statements. It follows that mind-brain\nidentities can occur only on the level of individual (token) events. It\nwould be beyond the scope of the present essay to consider Davidson's\ningenious approach, since it differs importantly from the more usual\nforms of identity theory.\n",
