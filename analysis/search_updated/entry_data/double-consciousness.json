    "preamble": "\n\nDouble-consciousness is a concept in social philosophy\nreferring, originally, to a source of inward \u201ctwoness\u201d\nputatively experienced by African-Americans because of their\nracialized oppression and disvaluation in a white-dominated society.\nThe concept is associated with William Edward Burghardt Du Bois, who\nintroduced the term into social thought in his groundbreaking The\nSouls of Black Folk (1903). Its source has been traced back from\nthere, by recent commentators, to the development of clinical\npsychology in the nineteenth-century North Atlantic, and to trends in\nidealist philosophies of self \u2013 the transcendentalism of Ralph\nWaldo Emerson and G.W.F. Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology of\nSpirit. It is thus indirectly related to other nineteenth- and\ntwentieth-century riffs on Hegelian themes, such as false\nconsciousness and bad faith. In our day it continues to be used by\nnumerous commentators on racialized cultures, societies, and\nliteratures; by cultural and literary theorists; and by students and\nresearchers of Africana Philosophy. Recent philosophical debates\ncenter on the significance of the concept for Du Bois\u2019s thought\noverall, its theoretical coherence, and its relevance given current\nsocial conditions.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Trajectory of the Concept\n\nIn an 1897 Atlantic Monthly article and again in his 1903\nSouls of Black Folk, Du Bois innovated by using a term\nalready in currency \u2013 and with multiple associations in a\nvariety of literary, philosophical, and scientific discourses \u2013\nin a distinctive and original way to name a theretofore largely\nunremarked phenomenon. The innovation was part of an account of the\nlife-experience he ascribed to \u201cblack folk\u201d in America\ngenerally in then-current social circumstances \u2013 Jim Crow in the\nsouth, de facto segregation in the North, and the threat and\nactuality of racist violence throughout the nation.\n\nThe term he used \u2013 \u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d \u2013\ndropped entirely, after just these two uses, from his published\nwriting. Those uses nonetheless struck a chord; use of the term,\ninterpreted in a number of ways, has frequently recurred as the\ncentury since its appearance has passed. While the disappearance of\nthe term from Du Bois\u2019s writing after 1903 has fueled questions\nabout the significance of the concept in the overall assessment of his\nwork, some commentators insist nonetheless on the centrality of the\nconcept for Du Bois\u2019s legacy.\n\nDu Bois was engaged throughout his long career in the attempt to\nunderstand both the socio-historic conditions facing \u201cBlack\nfolk\u201d in the American twentieth century, and the impacts of\nthose conditions on the consciousness and \u201cinner world\u201d of\nthe human beings subject to them. In Souls of Black Folk that\nsecond concern was with capturing in words \u201cthe strange meaning\nof being black\u201d, with describing the \u201cspiritual\nworld\u201d and the \u201cspiritual strivings\u201d of \u201cthe\nAmerican Negro\u201d. Du Bois continued to articulate responses to\nthese concerns in his later works: one finds formulations addressing\nthem even in his posthumously published Autobiography (1968).\nAs the contexts of Du Bois\u2019s writing, research, and activism\nchanged, these responses shifted in focus, emphasis, and perspective.\nBroadly speaking, as his reflections on what he initially termed the\n\u201cspiritual world\u201d of Black folk came to be more richly\nfilled out in the variety and extent of its details, Du Bois\u2019s\naccount of the phenomena he originally identified with the term\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d both overflowed the initial\nassociations of that term and became stratified under pressure from\nhis shifts in perspective. In what follows, we trace the fate of Du\nBois\u2019s 1903 account in his later work and then assess the\nreconstructed account on its own terms.\n\nThis article will, first, briefly survey some of the attempts to\nexplicate and contextualize the use of the concept by Du Bois in\nThe Souls of Black Folk of 1903 (hereafter Souls),\nand give a brief overview of controversies regarding the viability of\nthe concept and its significance for contemporary Africana thought.\nAfter presenting suggestions concerning the development of Du\nBois\u2019s understanding of the phenomenon after Souls,\nwe\u2019ll look briefly at three recent distinctive uses of it\n\u2018beyond the black/white binary\u2019. (The term Du Bois used\nwas \u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d, with the hyphen intact; more\nrecent writers have generally abandoned the hyphen. In this article\nthe hyphen is retained in discussing Du Bois\u2019s 1903 term and\nconcept, and interpretive attempts to get at it. But \u201cdouble\nconsciousness\u201d simpliciter is used when discussing the\nterm more generally in relation to current debates.)\n2. Double-Consciousness in The Souls of Black Folk\n\nThe locus classicus for the Du Boisian conception occurs in\nthe third paragraph of \u201cOf our Spiritual Strivings\u201d, the\nfirst chapter of Du Bois\u2019s 1903 Souls (a slightly\nmodified version of \u201cThe Strivings of the Negro People\u201d,\npublished in The Atlantic Monthly in August, 1897,\nwhere he first uses the term):\n\nAfter the Egyptian and Indian, the Greek and Roman, the Teuton and\nMongolian, the Negro is a sort of seventh son, born with a veil, and\ngifted with second-sight in this American world, \u2013 a world which\nyields him no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself\nthrough the revelation of the other world. It is a peculiar sensation,\nthis double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one\u2019s\nself through the eyes of others, of measuring one\u2019s soul by the\ntape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever\nfeels his two-ness, \u2013 an American, a Negro; two souls, two\nthoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark\nbody, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\n(1997 [1903]: 38) [This passage henceforth referred to as the\n\u201cStrivings\u201d text.]\n\n\nAn inspection of the passage reveals the complexity of its object.\nDouble-consciousness is identified as a \u201csensation\u201d, a\nconsciousness of one\u2019s self, but which falls short of a unified,\n\u201ctrue\u201d self-consciousness. It is part of a more complex\nfeeling of \u201ctwo-ness\u201d, of disparate and competing\n\u201cthoughts\u201d, \u201cstrivings\u201d, and\n\u201cideals\u201d. This is not an episodic or occasional sensation,\nbut a persistent form of consciousness. Ascribed to \u201cthe Negro\n\u2026 in this American world\u201d, it is a socio-cultural\nconstruct rather than a baldly bio-racial given, attributed\nspecifically to people of African descent in America. The\n\u201ctwo-ness\u201d of which it is a consciousness thus is not\ninherent, accidental, nor benign: the condition is presented here as\nboth imposed and fraught with psychic danger.\n\nDouble-consciousness is presented in conjunction with two other\nphenomena, related to two other figures \u2013 the\n\u201cveil\u201d, and the \u201cgift\u201d of\n\u201csecond-sight\u201d. Of these, \u201cthe veil\u201d is the\nmore insistent motif, recurring regularly throughout Souls as\nwell as other of Du Bois\u2019s writings. By contrast, the terms\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d and \u201csecond-sight\u201d seem\nnot to have been used in print by Du Bois after 1903. Still, this\npassage has come to have a singular significance in the philosophical\ninterpretation of Du Bois\u2019s thought as well as for the influence\nof his views. Only his oft-repeated claim at the very beginning of\nSouls, that \u201cthe problem of the Twentieth Century is\nthe problem of the color line,\u201d may be more widely known. The\nparagraph immediately following makes clear that, for Du Bois, this is\nnot only a \u201csensation\u201d but constitutes a crucial object of\n\u201cstriving\u201d and political struggle for black folk in the\nUnited States:\n\nThe history of the American Negro is the history of this strife,\n\u2013 this longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his\ndouble self into a better and truer self. In this merging he wishes\nneither of the older selves to be lost.\n\n\nThe phenomenon is identified again \u2013 but without being so named\nagain \u2013 in the tenth chapter of Souls, \u201cOf the\nFaith of the Fathers\u201d, an essay on \u201cNegro religious\nlife\u201d. Du Bois writes:\n\nFrom the double life every American Negro must live, as a Negro and as\nan American, as swept on by the current of the nineteenth while yet\nstruggling in the eddies of the fifteenth century, \u2013 from this\nmust arise a painful self-consciousness, an almost morbid sense of\npersonality, and a moral hesitancy which is fatal to self-confidence.\nThe worlds within and without the Veil of Color are changing, and\nchanging rapidly, but not at the same rate, not in the same way; and\nthis must produce a peculiar wrenching of the soul, a peculiar sense\nof doubt and bewilderment. Such a double life, with double thoughts,\ndouble duties, and double social classes, must give rise to double\nwords and double ideals, and tempt the mind to pretence or revolt, to\nhypocrisy or radicalism. (1997 [1903]: 155\u20136) [This passage\nhenceforth referred to as the \u201cFaith\u201d text.]\n\n\nHere double-consciousness, unnamed, is set in a more dynamic context\nthan in the earlier, \u201cStrivings\u201d text. The two passages,\nparallel in form, are subtly different in tone. Here Du Bois clearly\ndistinguishes two social \u201cworlds\u201d and the \u201cdouble\nlives\u201d that result. This text sweeps us along, showing a\ncausality, a coming-into-being of consciousness. And it concludes by\nnoting, in its final twenty words, the social and political\nconsequences of this \u201cpainful\u201d double-consciousness. Yet,\noddly, the \u201cFaith\u201d text is largely neglected in critical\ndiscussions.\n\nThe current relevance of double consciousness to an understanding of\nBlack lives, and of contemporary American reality, is debated in\nrecent commentary and scholarship. In an interview, the late Toni\nMorrison recalled the Du Boisian motif in characterizing the\nliterary work of Black men:\n\n\u2026 African American male writers justifiably write books about\ntheir oppression,\n\n\nshe says.\n\nConfronting the oppressor who is white male or white woman. It\u2019s\nrace. And the person who defines you under those circumstances is a\nwhite mind \u2013 tells you whether you\u2019re worthy or what have\nyou. And as long as that\u2019s your preoccupation, you\u2019re\ndefending yourself against that. Reacting to it. Reacting to the\ndefinition \u2013 saying it\u2019s not true.\n\n\nMorrison contrasts this to her own approach, which is to \u201ctake\naway the gaze of the white male. Once you take that out, the whole\nworld opens up\u201d. (Morrison 2012)\n\nAlso, the New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow has more\nthan once cited the \u201cStrivings\u201d text in commenting on the\ncontemporary paradoxes of black life brought into the open by some of\nPresident Obama\u2019s public statements in the wake of recent\ncriminal justice controversies (Blow 2013).\n\nA number of academic writers have worked to contextualize and\ninterpret Du Bois\u2019s notion of double-consciousness \u2013 most\noften focusing on the \u201cStrivings\u201d text, and neglecting the\n\u201cFaith\u201d text \u2013 to identify sources and antecedents\nthat influenced his conception, and to clarify the concerns he was\naddressing and his intentions in putting it forward. A brief resume of\nthat interpretive record follows.\n2.1 Americanist Romantic Longing\n\nIn his 1992 article \u201cW.E.B. Du Bois and the Idea of Double\nConsciousness\u201d, Dickson D. Bruce Jr. suggests a variety of\nsources of the complex of meanings marshaled at the time by Du\nBois\u2019s use of the term. The \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d\nfigure stems from the European romantic opposition between an innate\nhuman affinity for the transcendent and a pragmatic\n\u201cmaterialism\u201d grounded in a utilitarian attitude, oriented\nto mundane need and commercial enterprise. Tracing this understanding\nof double consciousness back to the American philosopher Ralph Waldo\nEmerson (and before him to Goethe), who used the term in his essay,\n\u201cThe Transcendentalist\u201d (1842), Bruce maintains that this\nanti-bourgeois romanticism is a \u201cfigurative background\u201d of\nDu Bois\u2019s use of the term, to which Du Bois brought the idea\nthat\n\nthe essence of a distinctive African consciousness was its\nspirituality\u2026 revealed among African Americans in their\nfolklore, their history of patient suffering, and their faith. (Bruce\n1999 [1992]: 238)\n\n\nBruce also briefly traces the trajectory of\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d in the medical and psychological\nliterature of the nineteenth century. An early appearance of the term\nin the Medical Repository in 1817 (Mitchill 1817: 185) used\nit to name the condition of one Mary Reynolds, who, for a period of\nabout fifteen years beginning in her nineteenth, alternately lived two\ndistinct lives, with wholly different personalities,\n\u2018uncognizant of\u2019 and inaccessible to each other. This use\nof the term had some currency throughout the nineteenth century;\nWilliam James, one of Du Bois\u2019s Harvard philosophy professors,\ndescribed such cases as alternating between \u201cprimary and\nsecondary consciousnesses\u201d in his considerable discussion of\nthem in the Principles of Psychology (1890: see esp. Vol. I,\n379\u2013393), published while Du Bois was at Harvard (although James\ndoes not seem to have used the term\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d) (Bruce 1999 [1992]: 240\u20131).\nBruce comments that\n\n\u2026based on Du Bois\u2019s use of\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d in his Atlantic essay he\ncertainly seems to have known the term\u2019s psychological\nbackground, because he used it in ways quite consistent with that\nbackground. (1999: 242)\n\n\n[Bruce does not note the appearance of the term, in French \u2013\n\u201cdouble conscience\u201d \u2013 in Josef Breuer and\nSigmund Freud\u2019s \u201cOn the Psychical Mechanism of Hysterical\nPhenomena\u201d published in 1893 in Neurologisches\nCentralblatt, Nos. 1 and 2. This paper was later reprinted as the\nfirst chapter of Studies on Hysteria, published in 1895.\nBreuer and Freud appear to use the French term in responding to and\ndeveloping its earlier use by Pierre Janet, relating it to\n\u201csplitting of consciousness\u201d and psychic\n\u201cdissociation\u201d. (For a discussion of the\nBreuer-Freud-Janet connection, see James Strachey\u2019s introduction\nto Studies on Hysteria.)]\n\nThe diverse associations of these senses of the term were crucial,\nBruce argues, to the resonance and suggestiveness of Du Bois\u2019s\ndistinctive use of the term: connotations of spiritual longing and\nunbridgeable opposition between two viewpoints, of the real\ndistinctiveness and moral parity of the two personae and the\npossibility of their merging in a new synthetic unity signifying a\ncure, a fact reported in a number of cases of the psychological\nmalady.\n2.2 Color-Line Hegelianism\n\nThe first book-length study thematizing Du Boisian\ndouble-consciousness was Sandra Adell\u2019s\nDouble-Consciousness/ Double Bind: Theoretical Issues in\nTwentieth-Century Black Literature (1994). Engaging debates over\ntheoretical approaches to Black literature, Adell argues for an\nintertextualism inspired by Derridean deconstruction, and aimed at\ntranscending the \u201cAfrocentric/ Eurocentric\u201d divide. The\nbook begins with a chapter on Du Bois\u2019s \u201cStrivings\u201d\ntext; Adell, following the lead of Joel Williamson\u2019s earlier\narticle, \u201cW.E.B. Du Bois as a Hegelian\u201d (1978), presents\nDu Bois\u2019s text as a reading and use of crucial passages in\nHegel. Du Boisian double-consciousness, she claims, \u201cemerges\nfrom the philosophy of Hegel as it is articulated in the\nPhenomenology of Spirit\u201d (1994: 8). She adduces as\nevidence for the Hegelian reading of Souls Du Bois\u2019s\nstudies with William James and Josiah Royce, references to Hegel in Du\nBois\u2019s Philosophy IV notebook from his time at Harvard, as well\nas his studies with von Trietschke in Berlin \u201c(in the midst of a\n\u2018Hegelian revival\u2019 when he arrived)\u201d (1994: 12).\n\nAdell identifies three \u201cinstances\u201d of the \u201cdoubling\nof consciousness\u201d in Hegel\u2019s text (in the section on\n\u201cSelf-Consciousness\u201d; in \u201cLordship and\nBondage\u201d; and in \u201cThe Unhappy Consciousness\u201d); it is\nthe third of these that, she claims, forms the basic pattern for the\n\u201cStrivings\u201d text:\n\nDu Bois\u2019s \u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d decontextualizes\nHegel\u2019s \u201cUnhappy Consciousness\u201d \u2026 and opens\nit up to other contexts. In this case, the new context is one upon\nwhich is inscribed the problem of the twentieth century: the problem\nof the color line. (1994: 19)\n\n\nAdell then sketches a reading of the entire text of Souls as\na detailed \u201csociological, psychological, and\nphilosophical\u201d account of \u201cthe Negro\u2019s\nbeing-in-the-world\u201d (1994: 19). Her reading identifies other\nborrowings from German Idealism, noting along the way that\n\nthe title of Du Bois\u2019s text itself, The Souls of Black\nFolk, remarks and reiterates the two concepts \u2013 soul and\nfolk (Volk) \u2013 that are central, not only to\nHerder\u2019s aesthetics, but to that of Hegel as well. (1994: 23)\n\n2.3 A Deflationist Reading\n\nWhat I\u2019ll call a \u201cdeflationist\u201d interpretation of Du\nBois\u2019s conception is pursued by Adolph Reed, Jr., in his 1997\nbook on Du Bois\u2019s political philosophy, W.E.B. Du Bois and\nAmerican Political Thought: Fabianism and the Color Line.\nReed\u2019s book offers a critique of what he dubs\n\u201cvindicationist\u201d approaches to Afro-American political\nthought \u2013 approaches attempting to show the significance of\nAfrican-American theorists by tracing analogies and connections\nbetween their work and the \u201cgreats\u201d of the (white)\nEuropean tradition (1997: 12). The double polemical thrust of\nReed\u2019s text questions the alleged sources of influence on Du\nBois\u2019s thinking, and rejects the claim that Du Boisian\ndouble-consciousness refers to a transhistorical feature of black life\nin America. He points to the disappearance of the term from Du\nBois\u2019s texts after 1903 to undercut the claims that it\n\u201cwas a definitive element, a key organizing principle of his\nthought\u201d or \u201ca moment in a distinctively black\nsocial-theoretical discourse or tradition\u201d (1997: 124). Reed\nconcludes that the claim\n\nthat millions of individuals experience a peculiar form of bifurcated\nidentity, simply by virtue of common racial status\u2026 seems\npreposterous on its face. (1997: 125)\n\n\nSetting out a contextualizing account, Reed shows the considerable\ncachet of ideas of duality current when Du Bois wrote, and argues that\nthe claims connecting Du Bois\u2019s use of double-consciousness to\nEmerson, James or Hegel fail. Reed aligns Du Bois\u2019s concept with\nevolutionary and Lamarckian social-scientific views instead. He argues\nthat an emphasis on double-consciousness emerges in Du Bois\ninterpretation only after the 1960s, when it supplants critical\nattention to the critique of Booker T. Washington\u2019s strategy of\n\u201caccommodation\u201d in the third essay of the book. Reed\nattributes this shift in focus to \u201can ideological current within\nthe post-segregation-era black petite bourgeoisie\u201d (1997: 130)\n\u201ccentered on assertion of black presence within hermetically\nconstituted communities of academic discourse\u201d (1997:\n94\u20135).\n\nErnest Allen Jr. presents a similarly deflationist case in his\narticle, \u201cDu Boisian Double Consciousness: The Unsustainable\nArgument\u201d (2002), arguing that the Du Boisian conception of\ndouble-consciousness was a \u201ctactical, political\u201d attempt\nto gain support among sympathetic white philanthropists for the\nefforts of cultural uplift and organization on the part of a\n\u201cTalented Tenth\u201d, an \u201ceducated black elite\u201d.\nThe rhetorical construction of a model of double-consciousness in\nSouls involves for Allen a \u201cdouble sleight of\nhand\u201d (2002: 25), requiring a slippage between a putative\nconflict of ideals within the minds of the black elite and a more\ngeneral problem for African Americans \u201cwho could not help but\nhave internalized some of the negative sentiments that white society\nheld towards them\u201d (2002: 29).\n\nThe attribution of distinctive \u201cAmerican\u201d and\n\u201cNegro\u201d ideals is empty, Allen argues: there are no clear\nexamples of \u201cNegro\u201d ideals in the offing in Du\nBois\u2019s text. Though there is no conflict between\n\u201cwarring\u201d ideals as claimed by Du Bois, there is\na conflict between white racial prejudice, intransigent hostility and\nexclusion of blacks, on the one hand, and the ideal of civic equality\nfor all emblazoned on the ideological banners of the American\nrepublic, on the other. This \u2013 what Allen calls \u201cthe\ninstitutionalized as well as everyday double consciousness and double\ndealings of white Americans\u201d \u2013 is, he claims, \u201cthe\nsocial foundation\u201d of the \u201cAfrican American ideological\nambivalence\u201d (2002: 38) that Du Boisian double-consciousness\nexpresses.\n2.4 An Analytic Politico-Philosophic Reconstruction\n\nRobert Gooding-Williams develops a tripartite account of the concept\nof double-consciousness as a keystone in Du Bois\u2019s\npolitical-philosophical project in his In the Shadow of Du Bois:\nAfro-Modern Political Thought in America (2009).\nDouble-consciousness functions as part of an account of the subjective\nexperience of African-Americans in conditions dominated by Jim Crow\nand the \u201ccolor line\u201d; it serves as an essential component\nof Du Bois\u2019s critique of certain forms of black political\nleadership under those conditions; and it underwrites Du Bois\u2019s\nown positive theory of \u201cpolitical expressivism\u201d.\nGooding-Williams, like Allen, distinguishes double-consciousness from\nthe more general idea of \u201ctwo-ness\u201d that Du Bois connects\nit to, arguing also that \u201csecond sight\u201d is a distinctive\nfeature of Du Bois\u2019s conception.\n\nGooding-Williams emphasizes that Du Bois presents the concept in\nSouls in a passage that begins with the question, \u201cHow\ndoes it feel to be a problem?\u201d \u2013 a question which\nreferences the so-called \u201cNegro problem\u201d. This indicates\nan inward approach to the \u201csubjective\u201d felt experience of\n\u201cthe Negro\u201d, an approach relating double-consciousness to\n\u201csecond sight\u201d, which Du Bois characterizes as a\n\u201cgift\u201d in this American world. Gooding-Williams finds two\nsources for the idea of second sight \u2013 one in African-American\nfolklore, and one in the nineteenth-century literature on animal\nmagnetism. Both these present it as a capacity for a sort of\nextra-sensory perception (e.g., of ghosts) or a kind of vision into\nthe future \u2013 a capacity to see what is not generally visible.\nGooding-Williams argues that Du Bois uses \u201csecond sight\u201d\nto identify \u201cthe Negro\u2019s\u201d capacity to see himself\nthrough the eyes of white Americans. Because white Americans\nconstitute what Du Bois refers to as \u201cthe other world\u201d, a\nsocial group distinct from that of black folk, whites\u2019\nperceptions of and views about blacks would not \u201cnormally\u201d\nbe available to blacks, for Gooding-Williams; it is second sight that\ngives such access. In \u201cthis American world\u201d, however,\nwhites\u2019 perspectives on blacks are deeply distorted by racial\nprejudice. It is the \u201cgift\u201d of second sight, then, that\nmakes blacks\u2019 self-consciousness into a \u201cfalse\nself-consciousness\u201d, Gooding-Williams claims, by fostering in\nthem a self-concept molded by contempt and a presumption of\ninferiority.\n\nThus, Gooding-Williams presents double-consciousness as a \u201cfalse\nself-consciousness\u201d arising through second sight exercised in\nconditions of a racially prejudiced dominant culture. This false\nconsciousness can make way for a \u201ctrue self-consciousness\u201d\nonly when those conditions have been transformed and whites no longer\nperceive blacks as \u201ccontemptible\u201d or\n\u201cinferior\u201d (for only then will the Negro\u2019s\n\u201csecond sight\u201d reflect a perception of himself undistorted\nby prejudice). This eventuality, neither inevitable nor unattainable,\nrequires the achievement of reciprocal recognition that has been\ndenied the Negro by the white \u201cother world\u201d throughout\nAmerican history, and is a prime object of the Du Boisian political\nproject. That project\u2019s broader object \u2013 indeed, the goal\nof the history of African-American striving \u2013 is for black\nAmericans to be recognized as \u201cco-workers in the kingdom of\nculture\u201d. Gooding-Williams concludes that the overcoming of\ndouble-consciousness is a necessary and sufficient condition for the\nachievement of full equality: equality grounded in reciprocal\nrecognition cannot be won without eradicating the basis for\ndouble-consciousness.\n\nGooding-Williams argues that Du Bois was concerned with\ndouble-consciousness not only as a correlate of the disenfranchised\ncondition that constitutes the so-called Negro problem, but also as a\ncrucial test of the effectiveness of those leading the struggle to\novercome that condition. In his discussions of Booker T. Washington\nand Alexander Crummell (in chapters III and XII of Souls), Du\nBois makes a case that both fell victim to double-consciousness,\nvitiating their effectiveness as leaders of the freedom struggle.\nSpecifically, Washington\u2019s \u201cAtlanta Compromise\u201d was\na strategy that undermined the struggle for recognition, reinforcing\ndouble-consciousness by failing to challenge the white perception of\nNegro \u201cinferiority\u201d.\n2.5 Rousseauian Self-Estrangement\n\nFrank Kirkland notes Du Bois\u2019s description of\ndouble-consciousness as a \u201cfeeling\u201d, and articulates that\nfeeling through Rousseau\u2019s notion of amour-propre, the\nform of \u201ccivilized\u201d self-love that is reflective,\ncontrastive, and radically corrosive of social solidarity.\n(Rousseau\u2019s account distinguishes amour-propre from\namour de soi, an instinctual urge to self-preservation;\namour-propre is a purely social feeling.)\n\nDu Bois\u2019 \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d refers to a black\nperson\u2019s felt awareness of the harmfully comparative measures of\nothers on her character and self-esteem, by which s\u2044he takes\nherself to be a problem in and of a social arrangement permitting such\nmeasures or obliging them. (2013: 144)\n\n\nFor Kirkland, Du Bois\u2019 conception of double-consciousness is\ninherently comparative, the consequence of amour-propre in\nconditions of the color line. Du Bois, according to Kirkland, began\nfrom the \u201cinflamed amour-propre of others\u201d:\n\nthose (of the darker races) have their own respect and esteem \u2026\ndenied or underestimated by others (of the lighter races), thereby\nagitating and worsening the color line. (2013: 140)\n\n\nFor Kirkland amour-propre is not the cause of the color-line,\nbut it does spread its reach and intensify its effects. Kirkland also\nstresses the element of awareness within double-consciousness, in\nkeeping with the Rousseauian analogy:\n\n[F]or Du Bois, this comparison gone awry is a matter about which black\npeople are, at least, sentient, awake to, even if they have not\ngrasped it conceptually,\n\n\nwrites Kirkland, adding that this is \u201ctheir sentience to the\ncomparison by which they are made a problem\u201d (2013: 140).\n\nKirkland follows the \u201cFaith\u201d text in identifying two forms\nof the danger double-consciousness poses for African-Americans: a\n\u201cdual/duelist\u201d threat of internally conflicted aspirations\nand expectations, and a \u201cduplicitous\u201d hypocritical stance.\nBoth these arise from the felt need to maintain self-esteem given\nhostility to one\u2019s ideals. Notably, Kirkland also identifies a\nthird, \u201cdyadic\u201d form of double-consciousness which\n\nwould reflect, via education, the result of an individual coming to a\ntrue, non-estranged comprehension of the position s\u2044he deserves\nin comparison to others as both a citizen and a person of color with\ncertain talents and competences. (2013: 142)\n\n\nThis \u201cnon-estranged\u201d mode of double-consciousness is a\n\u201csolution to the hazards\u201d of the other two forms,\naccording to Kirkland.\n2.6 Uses and Extensions of the Concept\n\nCornel West extends the analytic grasp of the concept as part of a\ncritical discussion of double-consciousness in his first book,\nProphecy Deliverance! (1982). In the first chapter, West\nsuggests an ingredient missing from Du Bois\u2019s analysis of the\nself-consciousness of Africans in America, claiming that\n\nDu Bois overlooked the broader dialectic of being American yet feeling\nEuropean, of being provincial but yearning for British\ncosmopolitanism, of being at once incompletely civilized and\nmaterially prosperous, a genteel Brahmin amid uncouth conditions.\nBlack Americans labored rather under the burden of a triple crisis of\nself-consciousness. Their cultural predicament was comprised of\nAfrican appearance and unconscious cultural mores, involuntary\ndisplacement to America without American status, and American\nalienation from the European ethos complicated through domination by\nincompletely European Americans. (1982: 30\u20131)\n\n\nWest further complicates his own enumeration of the tangled elements\nof the African-American cultural dialectic, referring to the\n\u201canxiety-ridden provinciality\u201d of Protestant-American\nself-identity, and the \u201cdistinctly antimodern values and\nsensibilities\u201d dominant in the southern states, the\n\u201cgeographic cradle of black America\u201d (1982: 31).\n\nWest\u2019s formulations do not unmake but add refinements on Du\nBois\u2019s basic claim. It\u2019s worth noting that, near the end\nof West\u2019s discussion, he acknowledges that, in the first\nattempts to shape their own self-identity, \u201cBlack people were\nrelatively uninformed about British culture\u2026\u201d. This seems\nto minimize the significance of \u201cBritish cosmopolitanism\u201d\nand \u201calienation from the European ethos\u201d as issues for\nblack folk in America generally.\n\nIn The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness\n(1993) Paul Gilroy extends Du Boisian double-consciousness both beyond\nthe American context and at odds with an essentialist understanding of\nrace. Gilroy claims double consciousness as an overriding thematic\nelement in Du Bois\u2019s thought and writing, both in and beyond\nSouls, part of Du Bois\u2019s attempt to subvert rigidly\nfixed racial identities as imposed categories keyed to the oppressive\nsocial structures of white supremacy. The \u201cStrivings\u201d text\nis taken as one early expression of Du Bois\u2019s own ambivalence\ntoward modernity \u2013 an ambivalence shared widely in diasporic\nblack cultures and political debates \u2013 and as prefiguring the\nincreasingly transnational and pan-racial scope of Du Bois\u2019s\nevolving concerns.\n\nIn a reading of Souls that is central to his book, Gilroy\nhighlights the\n\nnagging anxiety over the inner contradictions of modernity and a\nradical scepticism towards the ideology of progress with which it is\nassociated (1993: 117)\n\n\nhe finds there in germ form. Elements of an implicit global-diasporic\n\u2013 hence \u201cBlack Atlantic\u201d \u2013 perspective on\n\u201cthe meaning of being black\u201d in that text are in tension\nwith, and textually submerged under, the \u201csmooth flow of\nAfrican-American exceptionalisms\u201d (1993: 120). These elements\nwithin the discourse of Souls point to the wider significance\nof double consciousness, according to Gilroy. He claims this\nglobal-diasporic theme would, subsequent to Souls, come\n\u201cto illuminate the experience of post-slave populations in\ngeneral\u201d and to \u201canimate a dream of global co-operation\namong people of color which came to full fruition only in [Du\nBois\u2019] later work\u201d (1993: 126).\n\nPaget Henry\u2019s phenomenological treatment of Du Bois\u2019s\nconception in his \u201cAfricana Phenomenology: Its Philosophical\nImplications\u201d (2005) identifies a \u201ctheory\u201d of double\nconsciousness as part of a \u201ccomprehensive phenomenology of\nAfricana self-consciousness\u201d (2005: 85). Henry distinguishes Du\nBoisian double-consciousness from the double consciousness found in\nHegel\u2019s discussion of lordship and bondage in the\nPhenomenology by its focus on \u2018the Africana\nsubject\u2019 Hegel neglected entirely. Henry offers further\nan explication of Du Boisian \u201csecond sight\u201d: on his view,\nit is\n\nthe ability of the racialized Africana subject to see him/herself as\n\u201ca negro\u201d, that is, through the eyes of the white other.\n(2005: 89)\n\n\nHenry characterizes this as a \u201ccategoric form of self-blindness\n\u2026 a classic case of false consciousness\u201d (2005: 90). But\nHenry claims a further, ethically propitious form of second sight is\npossible \u2013 what he calls \u201cpotentiated second sight\u201d.\nThis is a \u201cvery special access and insight into the dehumanizing\n\u2018will to power\u2019 of the European imperial subject\u201d.\nThis \u201cpotentiating\u201d of second sight can occur, according\nto Henry, when an Africana subject is able to uproot the\n\u201cblackface\u201d stereotype from her consciousness and\nreconceive herself as \u201can African\u201d by operating\n\u201cwithin the creative codes of African discourses and\nsymbols\u201d (2005: 91). Henry cites the Rastafarians as an example\nof this route to potentiated second sight. An alternate route is\nthrough an individually acquired standpoint on the world, independent\nof white supremacy: Du Bois himself is an exemplar.\n\nHenry sees a close relation between Du Boisian double-consciousness\nand Frantz Fanon\u2019s existential-psychoanalytic account of black\nself-consciousness, found in Fanon\u2019s Black Skin, White\nMasks (1967). Noting the Freudian and Sartrean idiom in which\nFanon carries through his analyses in that text, Henry writes that\n\u201cthere is no finer or more detailed account of the state of\nracial double consciousness\u201d (2005: 95). In the very first pages\nof that text, Fanon makes clear his psychoanalytic orientation,\nwriting of the black\u2019s \u201cinferiority complex\u201d \u2013\na term first appearing in the book in an epigraph from Aim\u00e9\nC\u00e9saire\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism. Fanon\nobserves that\n\nThe effective disalienation of the black man entails an immediate\nrecognition of social and economic realities. If there is an\ninferiority complex, it is the outcome of a double process: primarily,\neconomic; subsequently, the internalization \u2013 or better, the\nepidermalization \u2013 of this inferiority. (1967: 10\u201311)\n\n\nHenry details a process he dubs \u201cnegrification\u201d, to which\nthe black is subject in the confines of the West. In that process,\n\u201ccolonized Africana people lost their earlier cultural\nidentities and became identified by the color of their skin\u201d\n(2005: 96). The white colonizer projects the most reprehensible and\nforbidden aspects of himself onto the black man, thereby bringing\nabout the stereotype of \u201cthe Negro\u201d. Fanon also borrows\nJungian formulations for his account, writing of the \u201ccollective\nunconscious of homo occidentalis\u201d, in which the black\nman \u201csymbolizes evil, sin, wretchedness, death, war,\nfamine\u201d. Referring to his native land, Fanon writes\n\n[i]n Martinique, whose collective unconscious makes it a European\ncountry, when a \u201cblue\u201d Negro \u2013 a coal-black one\n\u2013 comes to visit, one reacts at once: \u201cWhat bad luck is he\nbringing?\u201d (1967: 191)\n\n\nIn an earlier text, Caliban\u2019s Reason (2000), Henry uses\nthe Shakespearean motif, from The Tempest, of the clash of\nthe European colonizer Prospero with the native Caliban. He cites the\n\u201cCalibanization\u201d of the Africans imported by European\nslavers to the Caribbean:\n\n[C]olor eclipsed culture. \u2026 Africans were transformed into\nnegroes and niggers in the minds of Europeans. This racial violence\nshattered the cultural foundations of the African self\u2026. Race\nbecame the primary signifier of Europeans and Africans and of the\ndifferences between them. Consequently, the identities of these two\ngroups were rigidly inscribed in a set of binary oppositions that\nlinked the binary black/white to other binaries such as\nprimitive/civilized, irrational/rational, body/mind,\nprelogical/logical, flesh/spirit. (2000: 11\u20132)\n\n\nHenry sees Calibanization \u2013 the imposition of a racialized\nidentity based on a set of insidiously contrastive binaries on top of\nan original and native cultural identity grounded in African ways of\nlife \u2013 as the production of a form of double consciousness.\n\nLewis Gordon touches on double consciousness in his Introduction\nto Africana Philosophy (2008). Gordon starts from Du Bois\u2019s\n\u2018unasked\u2019 question, \u201cHow does it feel to be a\nproblem?\u201d For Gordon, this question presupposes the\nsubjectivity, and the humanity, of the black person being addressed.\nAnd yet, the ascription of the status of a \u201cproblem\u201d to\nthat person involves at the same time a denial of the\nhumanity of that black addressee. Gordon notes that \u201c[t]he\nappeal to blacks as problem-people is an assertion of their ultimate\nlocation outside the system of order and rationality\u201d (2008:\n76). This outsider status, Gordon suggests, is crucial to the\nformation of double consciousness, leading as it does to \u201cthe\nsplitting of worlds and consciousness itself according to the norms of\nU.S. society and its contradictions\u201d. Those norms instantiate\nthe fact that \u201c\u2018American\u2019 was persistently defined\nas \u2018white\u2019 in North America and the rest of the\nAmericas\u201d (2008: 77).\n\nGordon takes the \u201cnegative version\u201d of double\nconsciousness to result when the self-image of the black person is\nwholly determined by how racial others view her \u2013 her view of\nherself is a \u201cwhite point of view\u201d (2008: 78), relegating\nher to the status of noncitizen or second class citizen. Its\nepistemological significance is that one of the two perspectives\nimplicit in it \u2013 that of the white world \u2013 is necessarily\npartial, yet positions itself as universal, and so, is \u201ca form\nof consciousness that hides itself\u201d (2008: 79). But this\ndominant white self-concept brings into being a\n\u201csubaltern\u201d consciousness, a consciousness of the\ncontradictions of that dominant self-concept. This, Gordon claims, is\nthe second, doubling consciousness in its affirmative, fully realized\nmanifestation.\n3. Double-Consciousness in Souls of Black Folk: Problems\n\nThe preceding survey yields several points of contention: issues\nconcerning the source(s) of Du Bois\u2019s conception and\nterminology, of its putative Rousseauian, Hegelian and/or American\nphilosophical connections; the scope of the conception, that is, how\nwidely and to whom Du Bois thought it applied; the relation between\ndouble-consciousness and the psychic duality he associated it with;\nthe nature of \u201csecond sight\u201d, and its relation to\ndouble-consciousness; double-consciousness\u2019s relation to alleged\n\u201cpathology,\u201d and to critical awareness or critique; the\nconception\u2019s usefulness for an understanding of the situation of\nblack folk, both at the turn of the twentieth century when Du Bois put\nit forward, and today. Here we briefly recapitulate several of\nthese.\n\nThe first question, one Gooding-Williams identifies as a paradox,\nconcerns Du Bois\u2019s own invulnerability to double-consciousness.\nIf double-consciousness is indeed endemic to \u201cNegroes\u201d\n\u2013 if it was, in a sense, a structural problem for any\nNegro consciousness under conditions of Jim Crow \u2013 then how\ncould Du Bois himself write as if transcending it, as having\n\u201ctrue self-conscious manhood\u201d? Although Du Bois never\nexplicitly makes the claim that he himself is free from\ndouble-consciousness, his text hints at no such internal\nsoul-struggle. And yet, his conception of double-consciousness is\nintroduced as part of an account of his own personal experience and as\nbased on that experience.\n\nGooding-Williams tries to overcome this paradox by distinguishing the\nnarrative authority of Souls from the historical author of\nthe text. It is the narrator of Souls, and not Du Bois\nhimself, who has escaped double-consciousness. This may save\nSouls as a literary text, but it doesn\u2019t rescue the\nidea of black political leadership, implying that no actual black\npolitical leader is immune from double-consciousness. Another possible\nresolution to the paradox involves the notion of a second sight awake\nto the contradictions of the dominant white cultural milieu, allowing\na rejection of its biased assumption about black folk (what Henry\ncalls \u201cpotentiated second sight\u201d).\n\nDu Bois often insisted that his accounting of \u201cthe Negro\nproblem\u201d \u2013 or, alternatively, of \u201cthe race\nconcept\u201d \u2013 involves leading his readers \u201cwithin the\nVeil\u201d \u2013 making it possible for his (presumably mostly\nwhite) readers to gain some sense of the experience of \u201cbeing\nblack\u201d. This involves, as he puts it in Dusk of Dawn\n(1940), \u201celucidating the inner meaning and significance of that\nrace problem by explaining it in terms of the one human life that I\nknow best\u201d (1968 [1940]: viii). But that one life was one lived\nat the top of \u201cthe upper layers of educated and ambitious\nNegroes\u201d (1968 [1940]: 185), and so, it was exceptional. This\nreturns us to the question of the scope of double-consciousness.\n\nWhile Du Bois presents double-consciousness in the 1903 texts as a\nproblem for black folks generally given conditions of segregation and\nhistorically persisting inequality, a closer inspection of the text\nsuggests that the phenomenon might be specific to black leadership or\nthose who are most fully caught between the white world and\nthe world of color, who have deliberately undertaken the \u201cthe\nmoral uplift\u201d of the \u201cbackward\u201d black masses, and\nwho stand as \u201crepresentatives\u201d of these\n\u201cworlds\u201d to each other. The \u201cStrivings\u201d\npassage cites as illustrative examples only educated,\n\u201cbetter\u201d Negroes: the \u2018black artisan\u2019, the\nNegro minister or doctor, the \u201cwould be black\nsavant\u201d and the black artist. Du Bois also devotes\nseveral further chapters in Souls to detailed\ncharacterizations of the inner struggles of actual or fictional\nleaders \u2013 Washington, Crummell, and the fictional John Jones.\nYet much of the force of the claim for double-consciousness in the\n\u201cStrivings\u201d text is its universal attribution to\n\u201cthe Negro in this American world\u201d.\n\nSome recent commentators have rejected the claim that\ndouble-consciousness, in the sense of a self-perception of\ninferiority, has been a universal feature of black life. Molefi Kete\nAsante, discussing his own experience growing up in Valdosta, Georgia,\nin the 1950s, writes that\n\n[t]he tightly knit community of Africans who lived on the dirt roads\nof Valdosta never saw themselves as intellectually or physically\ninferior to whites. There existed no reference points outside of\nourselves despite the economic and psychological poverty of our\nsituation. (1993: 133)\n\n\nSeveral pages later Asante states flat-out, \u201cI was never\naffected by the Du Boisian double-consciousness\u201d (1993: 136). He\ndoes go on to acknowledge his distinct circumstances\n\nIt might have been another matter if I had gone to school and to\nchurch with whites when I was younger. I might have suffered\nconfusion, double-consciousness, but I did not. (1993: 137)\n\n\nA third issue for Du Bois\u2019s conception of double-consciousness\nconcerns its putative relation to the \u201ctwo-ness\u201d of the\nNegro psyche, which he never clarifies. Du Bois was concerned early on\nto establish a distinct contribution of \u201cthe Negro\u201d to\nworld culture and civilization, since lynch law and the backlash\nagainst Reconstruction raised the specter of genocidal extermination\nof black folk in America. A distinctly \u201cNegro\u201d cultural\ncontribution seems to require distinctive Negro \u201cideals\u201d.\nAllen and others have argued that Du Bois presents vague, seemingly\nempty, or contradictory accounts of just what the conflicting American\nand Negro \u201cideals\u201d are. The question, then, is whether Du\nBois\u2019s reference to such ideals can be sustained as an\nindependent source of the \u201ctwo-ness\u201d which Du Bois\nconnects to double-consciousness. If there are indeed such (non-empty)\nideals, and they are an independent source of conflictual two-ness,\nthen double-consciousness might turn out to be a more complex\nphenomenon yet.\n\nThe Du Boisian conception has been criticized as well for\noversimplifying the complex multidimensionality of contemporary\nselves, harboring a nostalgia for a unitary, integral self that never\nexisted, an unachievable ideal. Thus Darlene Clark Hine asserts:\n\nhad Du Bois specifically included the experiences and lives of black\nwomen in his lament, \u2026 instead of writing, \u201cOne ever\nfeels his twoness\u201d, he would have mused about how one ever feels\nher \u201cfiveness\u201d: Negro, American, woman, poor, black woman.\n(Hines 1993: 338)\n\n\nCritiques of Du Bois\u2019s conception along these lines have become\nwidespread, but, it might be argued, they are in one sense beside the\npoint. That the 1903 text is masculinist seems undeniable. But\nit\u2019s also true that Du Bois\u2019s\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d was not proposed as a comprehensive\naccount of the reality of human being, was not addressed to the\nvariety of sources of human social identity per se. His\nconception was an attempt to capture the lived experience of black\nfolk as black folk in the United States under conditions of\nJim Crow. So it would be wholly consistent with his conception if,\nadded to the doubling of consciousness due to racial oppression, other\nforms of psychic doubling or fragmentation, responses to other forms\nof inequality, might exist.\n\nHenry Louis Gates Jr. addresses the normative thrust of Du\nBois\u2019s conception in noting that\n\ncultural multiplicity is no longer seen as the problem, but as a\nsolution \u2013 a solution to the confines of identity itself. Double\nconsciousness, once a disorder, is now the cure. (2006: xv)\n\n\nThis remark depends on confusing a general duality or psychic\n\u201ctwo-ness\u201d with Du Bois\u2019s double-consciousness\nconception itself. Surely even if \u201ccultural multiplicity\u201d\nhas come to be valuable in itself, as Gates has it, the \u201camused\ncontempt and pity\u201d directed against oneself, crucial to Du\nBois\u2019s formulation, cannot be part of any\n\u201ccure\u201d.\n\nFinally, a question might be raised about the relation of Du\nBois\u2019s double-consciousness conception and the sorts of\nself-doubts, troubled feelings, and \u201cidentity issues\u201d that\nhave been linked to biracial or mixed-race appearance or identity in\nour persisting, harshly racialized American social world. White\nsupremacy has presented particular difficulties for persons of\nambivalent racial descent, visibly marked as brought into being by\n\u201crace mixing\u201d. Mixed-race persons have encountered\nhostility from \u201cboth sides\u201d, and are often deemed weak or\ninferior just because they are mixed, as Naomi Zack documents\nin her Race and Mixed-Race (1993: chapters 11, 12). Indeed,\nDu Bois was personally familiar with this issue. His \u201cmost\ninteresting\u201d professor during his university days in Berlin was\nHeinrich von Trietschke;\n\n[o]ne day he startled me by suddenly declaring during a lecture on\nAmerica: \u201cDie Mulattin sind niedrig! Sie fuhlen sich\nniedrig!\u201d [Mulattoes are inferior; they feel themselves\ninferior.] I felt as if he were pointing me out; but I presume he was\nquite unaware of my presence. However my presence or absence would\nhave made no difference to him. \u2026 My fellow students gave no\nevidence of connecting what he said with me. (Du Bois 1968: 165)\n\n\nYet when Du Bois formulated \u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d in\nSouls, mixed-race and skin-color discriminations within the\nblack racial designation were not topics he addressed in print. The\nduality posited in the texts of 1903 is one between\n\u201cNegro\u201d \u2013 an identity then typically keyed to a\nmetaphysically conceived racial designation \u2013 and\n\u201cAmerican\u201d \u2013 one based on a putative citizenship\nstatus. Racial designation at that time was determined primarily\nthrough hypodescent, and the citizenship status of black folk had\nrecently been impugned by Plessy v. Ferguson (1896).\n4. Du Boisian Double-Consciousness after Souls?\n\nCommentators are agreed that while Du Bois names\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d and uses the concept in his own way\nin that 1903 text, the term does not reappear in any of his subsequent\ntexts. That does not mean he abandons the concept, of course, yet most\nof the commentary on the concept focuses on the\n\u201cStrivings\u201d text in Souls. There have been some\nattempts to interpret various of his other works in terms of the\nconception, but these tend to focus on his fictional writings, and the\nuse made of these is not primarily to develop the conception but\nrather to show its uses by Du Bois in other contexts. This is\nundoubtedly due both to the canonical status of that 1903 text in\nAfrican-American literature and social criticism and to the fact of\nits very singular use there. More than one writer has asserted that\nthe passage in which Du Bois presents the term is the most-referenced\ntext in all African-American letters.\n\nIt seems problematic, however, to pin a full-blown account of and\ntheoretical reconstruction on one passage in one work, however seminal\nor influential it may have been. So it may be useful to examine\nseveral later texts of Du Bois\u2019s to see if the claim some\ncommentators have made that Du Bois abandons the conception after 1903\ncan be substantiated or rejected. There are discussions in later texts\nthat seem to involve aspects, at least, of the 1903 conception.\n4.1 \u201cThe Souls of White Folks\u201d in Darkwater (1920)\n\nWhile Du Bois does not present the \u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d\nconcept in so many words in Darkwater, published in 1920, the\nsecond chapter of that text, \u201cThe Souls of White Folks\u201d,\nseems to invoke it. There, Du Bois characterizes the development of\nwhat he calls \u201cthe religion of whiteness\u201d and discusses\nits impact on social relations in the nineteenth and the early\ntwentieth centuries. Du Bois makes a claim for a special kind of\nknowledge of the psychology of white people. He writes of himself\nthat, about them, \u201cI am singularly clairvoyant\u201d. After\nspecifying that his knowledge is not that of the foreigner, nor of the\nservant or the worker, he writes:\n\nI see these souls undressed and from the back and sides. I see the\nworking of their entrails. I know their thoughts and they know that I\nknow. (Du Bois 1920: 17)\n\n\nDu Bois here claims an insight into the psyches of whites that depends\nin part on an awareness of their beliefs and attitudes concerning\nrace, of their falseness. This insight is of the kind that\ndouble-consciousness makes possible. But what Du Bois claims here also\nseems to go beyond the 1903 conception, since that conception did not\nspecifically and explicitly refer to knowledge of the souls\nof white folks. Several pages into the \u201cSouls of White\nFolks\u201d chapter, after identifying the \u201cdiscovery of\npersonal whiteness\u201d as an historically recent phenomenon\nassociated with \u201cthis new religion of whiteness\u201d, Du Bois\nindicates that it is black folk generally \u2013 \u201cwe\u201d\n\u2013 who have such powers of \u201cclairvoyance\u201d:\n\nWe whose shame, humiliation and deep insult [the white man\u2019s]\naggrandizement so often involved were never deceived. We looked at him\nclearly, with world-old eyes, and saw simply a human being, weak and\npitiable and cruel, even as we are and were. (1920: 20)\n\n\nHere is a condition of consciousness that allows \u201cthe\nhumiliated\u201d to see more clearly the reality of the lives of\nthose who humiliate than the humiliators themselves do. While such\nknowledge does not involve \u201cknow[ing] the thoughts\u201d of the\nhumiliators in detail, it does require that one know some\npatterns of what and how they think and feel. Du Bois is here\nconsidering the ideology of white supremacy, tracing out the\nhistorical conditions of its development and some of the psychological\nconsequences it has for whites who accept it and live in and on the\nbasis of it. To the extent that whites accept the premises of white\nsupremacy, and live and act upon them, they are deceived about\nthemselves and act out a deception that the blacks who are\nsubject to the consequences of those premises are in a position to see\nthrough. This is not the core of double-consciousness, though it seems\nto be the sort of thing Du Bois had in mind when he referred in 1903\nto \u201csecond sight\u201d, a key adjunct to double-consciousness,\nin the \u201cStrivings\u201d passage. This matches the reading found\nin Henry, Gordon, and Kirkland as well.\n\nBut there is a bit more here, and other than, \u201csecond\nsight\u201d. For what Du Bois presents in this chapter is a critical\nanalysis of the American ideology of white supremacy that is informed\nby sociological analysis and backed up by historical and\nsocial-scientific understanding. Du Bois both begins and ends the\nchapter by noting his own position \u201chigh in the tower\u201d.\nThis presumably refers both to his distanced, observer status, and,\nrelatedly, to his own achieved position as an academically trained\nsocial scientist \u2013 indeed, one of the most highly trained minds\nin America at the time \u2013 bringing his powers of analysis to bear\non the \u201csouls of white folk\u201d. Du Bois gives a\nscientifically-informed, nuanced historical analysis built on a\n\u201cclairvoyant\u201d insight into the psyche of the white person\n\u201cunder the influence\u201d of white supremacist ideology, one\npredicated on both the second sight and a kind of\nideology-critique.\n4.2 \u201cOn Being Ashamed of Oneself: An Essay on Race Pride\u201d (1933)\n\nDu Bois begins the essay, published in Crisis in September,\n1933, with a story about his grandfather, who indignantly rejected an\ninvitation to a \u201cNegro\u201d picnic:\n\n[i]t meant close association with poverty, ignorance and suppressed\nand disadvantaged people, dirty and with bad manners. (Du Bois 1933:\n199)\n\n\nHe then succinctly captures the whole dilemma of those in the Negro\n\u2018upper crust\u2019:\n\nbecause the upper colored group is desperately afraid of being\nrepresented before American whites by this lower group, or being\nmistaken for them, or being treated as though they were part of it,\nthey are pushed to the extreme of effort to avoid contact with the\npoorest classes of Negroes. This exaggerates, at once, the secret\nshame of being identified with such people and the anomaly of\ninsisting that the physical characteristics of these folk which the\nupper class shares, are not the stigmata of degradation. (1933: 199)\n\n\nHere Du Bois draws out the intra-racial implications and grounds of\nthis aspect of double consciousness \u2013 what he identifies as\n\u201cbeing ashamed\u201d of members of one\u2019s group, and, so,\nindirectly and implicitly, of oneself. He also reiterates a theme\narising from the first in his thinking about double-consciousness\n\u2013 its close connection to divergent personal and political\nstrategies for managing, and working to transform, its social\nconditions. He identified these especially in the 1903\n\u201cFaith\u201d text, where he speaks both of \u201cdouble\nclasses\u201d and of \u201cpretense or revolt\u201d,\n\u201chypocrisy or radicalism\u201d. In the 1920 text, Du Bois notes\nthat such feelings of shame can motivate the strategy of \u201crace\nsuicide\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe attempt to escape from\nourselves\u201d, as he describes assimilation. This attempt involves\n\u2013 and also is grounded in \u2013 \u201ca drawing of class\nlines inside the Negro race\u201d and \u201cthe emergence of a\ncertain social aristocracy\u201d defined by \u201clooks\u201d\n\u2013 by which Du Bois presumably means complexion \u2013 as well\nas education, income, cultivation, and aspiration.\n\nBut this sense of shame is both impediment and adjunct of any strategy\nbased on race pride and solidarity, as well, since it can undermine\nany concerted political action, which demands racial unity in common\ncause, and under the leadership of the \u201ctalented tenth\u201d of\nrace aristocrats, to be successful. While calling for efforts\n\u201cto build up a racial ethos\u201d, Du Bois thus warns against\ntoo extreme a version of such \u201cpropaganda for race pride\u201d,\ncounseling Blacks to avoid reproducing what he describes as a\n\u201csuperiority complex among the white and the yellow\nrace\u201d.\n4.3 Dusk of Dawn (1940)\n\nThere is a discussion of something like double-consciousness in Du\nBois\u2019s book Dusk of Dawn, published in 1940, two years\nafter Du Bois turned seventy. Indeed, since Dusk of Dawn is\nmore nearly autobiographical in design than Souls (its\nsubtitle is An Essay Toward an Autobiography of a Race\nConcept) it\u2019s not surprising that Du Bois writes more\nexpansively there of black life in conditions of segregation and white\nsupremacy, even though he doesn\u2019t use the term employed in\nSouls. But also, by this time, his conception of race itself\nhas opened up even further beyond that of any linear historical\ndevelopment. As he writes at the end of the central chapter of that\nbook, \u201cThe Concept of Race\u201d,\n\nIt had as I have tried to show all kinds of illogical trends and\nirreconcilable tendencies. Perhaps it is wrong to speak of it at all\nas \u201ca concept\u201d rather than as a group of contradictory\nforces, facts, and tendencies. (1940: 133)\n\n\nA number of things change in the account given by Du Bois in Dusk\nof Dawn of the phenomena that, in Souls, are brought\nunder the sign of double-consciousness.\n\nThe first is that the Dusk of Dawn treatment of the issues is\nsubsumed much more fully under a thematics of\n\u201cenvironment\u201d, articulated as socio-political,\ngeographical, and cultural in its dimensions, and both dynamic and\nrelatively stable in historical terms. Writing about \u201cthe facts\nof the Negro\u2019s double environment\u201d, Du Bois explains:\n\nThe Negro American has for his environment not only the white\nsurrounding world, but also, and touching him usually much more nearly\nand compellingly, is the environment furnished by his own colored\ngroup. There are exceptions, of course, but this is the rule. The\nAmerican Negro, therefore, is surrounded and conditioned by the\nconcept which he has of white people and he is treated in accordance\nwith the concept they have of him. On the other hand, so far as his\nown people are concerned, he is in direct contact with individuals and\nfacts. (1940: 173)\n\n\nThis way of putting it is prefigured in the \u201cFaith\u201d text\nof Souls, in which Du Bois writes of the \u201cdouble\nlife\u201d of Black folk and of the \u201cworlds within and without\nthe Veil of Color\u201d. Note also the claim that, while the\ninhabitants of the \u201cwhite world\u201d and the \u201ccolored\nworld\u201d look at one other each through \u201cthe concept\u201d\nthey have of one another, individuals within the \u201ccolored\nworld\u201d know each other through \u201cdirect contact\u201d.\nThis is the impact of the veil, the color line. Writing of his own\npersonal experience, Du Bois details the effect of this environing\nwhite world on him:\n\nI was by long education and continual compulsion and daily reminder, a\ncolored man in a white world; and that white world often existed\nprimarily, so far as I was concerned, to see with sleepless vigilance\nthat I was kept within bounds. All this made me limited in physical\nmovement and provincial in thought and dream. I could not stir, I\ncould not act, I could not live, without taking into careful daily\naccount the reaction of my white environing world. (1940: 135\u20136)\n\n\nThere is in this account, in addition to the definite limitation of\npossibilities imposed by the veil \u2013 and consequent to it \u2013\nan active appropriation, and employment in strategic thinking by Du\nBois, of the understanding he has of the white world. This suggests\nanother, practical mode in which double consciousness \u2013 which is\nwhat we are dealing with here \u2013 can operate. If double\nconsciousness also is practical consciousness, \u201ctaking\ninto careful daily account\u201d whites\u2019 reactions \u2013\ntinged as they are by prejudice, by expectations grounded in that\nprejudice \u2013 in one\u2019s plans, one\u2019s own expectations,\nthat would not necessarily involve internalizing the prejudicial\nracist viewpoint itself, though it might nonetheless produce profound\ndisturbance of the soul. Double consciousness would then also yield a\npractical, and affective, rather than a strictly cognitive, impact of\nthe environing conditions on the black soul.\n\nThere is also, on the Dusk of Dawn account, a further, more\ntelling and insidious effect of the white world on the black soul,\nhere exemplified by Du Bois:\n\n\u2026 this fact of racial distinction based on color was the\ngreatest thing in my life and absolutely determined it, because this\nsurrounding group, in alliance and agreement with the white European\nworld, was settled and determined upon the fact that I was and must be\na thing apart. It was impossible to gainsay this. It was impossible\nfor any time and to any distance to withdraw myself and look down upon\nthese absurd assumptions with philosophical calm and humorous\nself-control. (1940: 136)\n\n\nThe \u201cabsurd assumptions\u201d can and do infiltrate the\nNegro\u2019s psyche, affecting how she thinks and feels about herself\nin ways that stubbornly resist her own efforts to override or ignore\nthem. More rarely, perhaps, they elicit fierce and abiding anger, even\nrage. Writing in a less autobiographical vein, Du Bois notes that\ndespair of racial progress \u201ctoo often\u201d results from the\nNegro\u2019s \u201clack of faith in essential Negro possibilities\nparallel to similar attitudes on the part of the whites\u201d. This\nattitude itself is, he continues, \u201ca natural phenomenon\u201d,\nsince Negroes share \u201caverage American culture and current\nAmerican prejudices\u201d. Because of this, it is\n\nalmost impossible for a Negro boy trained in a white Northern high\nschool and a white college to come out with any high idea of his own\npeople or any abiding faith in what they can do. (1940: 191)\n\n\nThis, arguably, is Du Boisian double-consciousness as set out in\nSouls.\n\nBut the 1940 text never asserts a basic inner duality within the\nNegro: missing entirely from the Dusk of Dawn account is any\nmention of inward two-ness, of the psychic splitting that was so\ncrucial to the account given in Souls. In the 1940 text the\nissue is characterized in the terminology of \u201cNegro\nself-criticism\u201d (1940: 179), a \u201clack of faith in essential\nNegro possibilities\u201d (1940: 191), and the \u201cinner\ncontradiction and frustration which [segregation and white racist\nintransigence] involves\u201d (1940: 187) \u2013 a terminology that\nconveys the ambivalence and complexity of the earlier text, but falls\nfar short of asserting an overriding psychic duality. And this is not\nbecause the text does not address the \u201cfelt experience\u201d of\nbeing black in America: the central, longest, chapter in Dusk of\nDawn is \u201cThe Colored World Within\u201d.\n\nThere are, \u2018naturally\u2019, problems with the unitary\nconsciousness of a soul within the double environment Du Bois depicts,\nbut these fall short of causing a split in the psyche itself. There is\nresentment, frustration, and anger; there is a faithlessness, and,\noften, consequent despair; there are the temptations to turning\none\u2019s back on \u2018the folk\u2019; and also temptations to\nreject absolutely anything the \u201cenvironing\u201d white world\noffers or proposes. And there is what Du Bois calls\n\nthat bitter inner criticism of Negroes directed in upon themselves,\nwhich is widespread. It tends often to fierce, angry, contemptuous\njudgment of nearly all that Negroes do, say, and believe\u2026.\n(1940: 179)\n\n\nWhat two-ness there is in the Dusk of Dawn account has been\nrelocated from the inwardness of souls to the \u201cenvironing\u201d\nworld.\n\nThere are two other ways the Dusk of Dawn account diverges\nsignificantly from that of Souls. First, the brute facticity\nof what Du Bois calls the \u201cinferiority\u201d of the colored\nworld is asserted in this text explicitly, and its effect upon the\nattitudes of Negroes described tellingly. Du Bois presents this stark\nreality as undeniable, while at the same time rejecting the related\nclaims made by racist prejudice:\n\nIt is true, as I have argued, that Negroes are not inherently ugly nor\ncongenitally stupid. They are not naturally criminal and their poverty\nand ignorance today have clear and well-known and remediable causes.\nAll this is true: and yet what every colored man living today knows is\nthat by practical present measurements Negroes today are inferior to\nwhites. The white folk of the world are richer and more intelligent;\nthey live better; have better government; have better legal systems;\nhave built more impressive cities; larger systems of communication and\nthey control a larger part of the earth than all the colored peoples\ntogether. (1940: 173\u20134)\n\n\nBy invoking these facts, Du Bois is citing historically contingent yet\npalpably certain realities that, he claims, \u201cevery colored man\nliving today knows\u201d. Consequently, \u201cNegro\nself-criticism\u201d is, in part, grounded in \u201ca perfectly\nobvious fact\u201d (1940: 179), \u201cthat most Negroes in the\nUnited States today occupy a low cultural status\u201d and a\n\u201clow social condition\u201d (1940: 180). Among these, he\ndiscusses \u201cNegro ignorance\u201d, death rate, \u201ccriminal\ntendencies\u201d, poverty, and \u201csocial degradation\u201d. Du\nBois lists these not as representations of white prejudice but in\nacknowledgment of patent observable realities. Though their causes,\npresent and past, count against the prejudiced conclusions often drawn\nin the white world, these causes are less visible, less obvious.\n\nAnother important departure of Dusk of Dawn from\nSouls is an explicit recognition in the later text that the\npsychic phenomena attributed to Negro Americans are not distinctive of\ntheir experience alone. Du Bois writes,\n\n[s]imilar phenomena may be noticed always among undeveloped or\nsuppressed peoples or groups undergoing extraordinary experience. None\nhave more pitilessly castigated the Jews than the Jewish prophets,\nancient and modern. (1940: 179)\n\n\nHe goes on to cite as further cases the Irish and the Germans of the\nSturm und Drang period. In 1940 Du Bois makes a broader\nhistorical claim, that \u201cthe imprisoning of a human group with\nchains in the hands of an environing group\u201d was not \u201ca\nsingularly unusual characteristic of the Negro in the United States in\nthe nineteenth century\u201d, but, rather, \u201cthe majority of\nmankind has struggled through this inner spiritual\nslavery\u2026\u201d (1940: 137).\n5. Beyond the Black/White Binary, Beyond Double Consciousness\n\nSo far we have considered applications and extensions of the original\ndouble consciousness notion to encompass the experiences of persons of\nAfrican heritage, within the United States, and more broadly in the\nAfrican diaspora. There have been other recent deployments of the\nconcept that extend its reach to the other side of, and then beyond,\nwhat\u2019s been called the \u2018black/white binary.\u2019 We note\nthree of them here.\n\nOne recent inquiry \u2013 Nelson Maldonado-Torres\u2019s 2006\narticle, \u201cPost-continental Philosophy: Its Definition, Contours,\nand Fundamental Sources\u201d \u2013 explores a version of double\nconsciousness of normative subjects of \u2018dominant (white)\nEuropean\u2019 cultures, citing the oeuvre of J-P Sartre as\na case study. The increasing diversity of evolving U.S. society, and\nthe approaching \u2018tipping point\u2019 into a\n\u2018majority-minority\u2019 \u2018non-white\u2019 population,\nhave shifted theoretical interest onto the decline of\n\u2018whiteness\u2019 and issues related to double consciousness but\nin a pluralist rather than a racial-binary context. Linda Alcoff, who\nhas argued for the need to get beyond a binary conception of U.S.\nracial dynamics, considers the rise of \u2018white double\nconsciousness\u2019. Finally, Jos\u00e9 Medina advocates for a\nrelated \u2018kaleidoscopic consciousness\u2019 as a personal tactic\nfor resisting epistemic injustice in conditions of the fight for\npluralist democracy.\n5.1 A \u2018Post-Continental\u2019 Turn\n\nA distinctive application of \u2018double consciousness\u2019 comes\nout of \u2018decolonial\u2019 theory. Of and from non-dominant\ncultures and social groupings, these theorists\u2019 commitment to\nsocial struggles at the \u2018borderlands,\u2019 in geopolitically\nliminal spaces, yields arguments from doubled perspectives, both\nwithin and outside the dominant, \u2018North Atlantic\u2019 system.\nThinkers like Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Sylvia Wynter, and Walter\nMignolo, among others, came to constitute this movement, featuring\ndistinctive styles of inquiry and writing, advocating a\n\u2019decolonial turn\u2019 in humanistic research. A philosophical\nargument associated with this group, making explicit use of the notion\nof double consciousness, is Nelson Maldonado-Torres\u2019s account of\n\u2018Post-Continental Philosophy\u2019.\n\nOne guiding purpose of the de-colonial project is simply to make the\ncharge of Eurocentrism stick against the dominant modern\n\u2018Western\u2019 intellectual tradition initiated at the time of\nDescartes. Maldonado-Torres\u2019 use of double consciousness takes\nit in its original bivalent Du Boisian form \u2013 as a source of\nboth potentially deleterious illusion and of veridical insights; he\nemploys it as an interpretive strategy for critiquing the\n20th-century Continental tradition in philosophy, and\nthrough it the entire modern European tradition. He does so by\nsituating that philosophical tradition in global anti-systemic\nstruggles originating and developing in Western-hemispheric societies.\nIn this connection the term \u2018post-Continental\u2019 alludes not\nonly to the commonly accepted name of the primarily French- and\nGerman-speaking European phenomenological tradition.\n\u2018Post-Continental\u2019 also signifies its rejection of the\nprevailing \u2018geography of power,\u2019 the largely implicit\nnotion that the (European) continent is the locus of all significant\nmodern philosophical production.\n\nOf the canonical figures in that continental tradition, it is Sartre\nwho Maldonado-Torres sees as expressing the double consciousness of\nEuropean modernity, its intellectual guilty conscience. Double\nconsciousness serves as an interpretive schema for reevaluating the\nmeaning of both Sartre\u2019s overall intellectual activity as well\nas the Sartrean conception of bad faith. This is now read as an\nimplicit critique of the complicity of the intellectual culture of\nmodernity in domination, with particular reference to the colonialist\nentanglements of its dominant philosophical traditions. Developing the\npolitical argument and its philosophical critique involves arguing\nthat for Sartre, bad faith should be understood not only in an\nindividual, but also in a social, collective sense, cutting against\nits standard, individualist interpretation. \u201cFor Sartre,\nEuropean modernity is a project of bad faith\u201d (2006, 13).\n\nMaldonado-Torres distinguishes the double consciousness of the\n\u2018normative subject,\u2019 privileged member of the dominant\nsocial order, from that of the \u2018damned\u2019 \u2013 a term\ntaken from Fanon\u2019s Les Damn\u00e9s de la Terre (1961)\n(translated as The Wretched of the Earth, for which Sartre\nwrote a preface) referring to those peopling the\n\u2018underworld\u2019 at the bottom of the world-system. The double\nconsciousness of the oppressed arises in their direct experience with\nthe system in which their very being and daily existence confront them\nwith the lies and willed ignorance \u2013 the falsehoods, the\n\u2018looking away\u2019 and complicity of those who benefit \u2013\non which that system depends for its reproduction. The contradiction\nbetween the purported ideals of the oppressive system and the reality\nof their lives is, for them, starkly apparent.\n\nFor the normative subjects, however, the lie is, in a sense, within\nthem, insofar as they are complicit with the regime; their\nconfrontation with that lie demands self-scrutiny and self-critique.\nThis complicity with oppression and the lies it involves, and the\nself\u2019s confrontation with its own duplicity, can be understood\nin terms of Sartre\u2019s account of bad faith. As Maldonado-Torres\nputs it, there is within the normative subject a struggle whether to\ntake on fully the dominant culture\u2019s \u201cdemand \u2026 to\noccupy the center of the world.\u201d This demand represents a\nrequirement that the self, \u201cwith the help of an impressive\ncultural, symbolic, material, and epistemological arsenal, posits\nitself as normative,\u201d and thereby accedes to playing a part in\nthe \u201cdehumanization of Europe\u2019s racialized and colonized\npopulations.\u201d Bad faith, which, in Sartre\u2019s terms, is the\nsubject\u2019s refusal of its own freedom, a flight from\nresponsibility and into conformism, finds a political expression in\nthe dominant culture\u2019s demand for normative subjects\u2019\nconformity.\n\nBad faith is the conceptual hinge of Sartre\u2019s entire critical\nresponse to the situation of European \u2018civilization\u2019 as he\nfound it already at the inception of his philosophical career. The\nculmination of European anti-Semitism in the Holocaust and the war\nagainst fascism \u2013Maldonado-Torres calls this the \u2018crisis\nof genocidal Europe\u2019 \u2013 fueled by the active participation\nor silent complacence of much of the intellectual middle classes, was\nthe original condition for Sartre\u2019s political-philosophical\nauthorship. Sartre\u2019s engagement with the global anti-colonial\nstruggle that followed the allied victory, and particularly the\nAlgerian revolution, confirmed and focused Sartre\u2019s increasingly\npolitical opposition to the policies of the dominant European\npowers.\n\nHis engagement with the work of the Afro-Caribbean theorists\nAim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire and Frantz Fanon pushed him further, adding\nenergy to his sometimes explicitly anti-racist critical reflection.\nSartre\u2019s engagement with their thought make him, for\nMaldonado-Torres, a \u2018border subject\u2019 as well, grounded in\nthe split allegiances of a kind of \u2018double life,\u2019 itself a\nproduct of this basic rift at the heart of Europe\u2019s empire.\nMaldonado-Torres quotes a passage from Sartre\u2019s\n\u201cPreface\u201d to Fanon\u2019s The Wretched of the\nEarth, in which Sartre addresses the book\u2019s [presumably\nwhite] French reader. The quotation reads, in part:\n\n\nThis fat and pallid continent has ended up lapsing into what Fanon\nrightly calls \u2018narcissism.\u2019 Cocteau was irritated by\nParis, \u2018the city which is always thinking about itself.\u2019\nWhat else is Europe doing? Or that super-European monster, North\nAmerica? What empty chatter: liberty, equality, fraternity, love,\nhonour, country, and who knows what else? That did not prevent us from\nholding forth at the same time in racist language: filthy n***er,\nfilthy Jew, filthy North Africans. Enlightened, liberal and sensitive\nsouls \u2013 in short, neocolonialists \u2013 claimed to be shocked\nby this inconsistency; that is an error or bad faith. Nothing is more\nconsistent, among us, than racist humanism, since Europeans have only\nbeen able to make themselves human beings by creating slaves and\nmonsters.\n\n\nHere, then, through Sartre, double consciousness takes the form of\nboth a confession and a self-critique, an admission and a renunciation\nof duplicity. Maldonado-Torres\u2019s use of double consciousness as\na lens through which to read Sartre\u2019s conception of bad faith\nsharpens Sartre\u2019s account of European culture\u2019s willing\nracial ignorance, its foundational self-deception, and shows his\nambivalence toward Europe\u2019s oppressive civilizational\nhierarchies. It is what Maldonado-Torres calls Sartre\u2019s\n\u2018potentiated\u2019 double consciousness that, he claims, yields\nSartre\u2019s critical relation to the colonialist complicity of the\ncontinental tradition. Sartre\u2019s focus on the self-deceptive\naspects of the modern European tradition\u2019s intellectual\nidentity, taken as the historical work of double consciousness, both\nreveals and subverts the hypocritical complicity of the philosophical\nmainstream with the geopolitics of colonialism.\n5.2 White Double Consciousness\n\nA similar argument about the applicability of Du Bois\u2019s notion\nto \u2018white folk\u2019, in the American vortex, is presented by\nLinda Alcoff. In The Future of Whiteness (2015), she claims\nthat many white Americans are subject to \u2018white double\nconsciousness\u2019 due in part to recent social changes. The\nbook\u2019s argument \u2013 part of an anti-racist \u2018project to\nrearticulate whiteness\u2019 \u2013 describes what she calls the\n\u2018crisis of white hegemony\u2019 and the pressure exerted by\nthis crisis on white individuals\u2019 racial identity and\nself-understanding. Her account specifically addresses the\ndisaffection of many \u2018progressive\u2019 whites from the\ndominant, mainstream cultural form of whiteness, and from its\njustification by what she calls \u2018white vanguardism,\u2019 a\nfalse historical narrative of a decidedly racist cast. (Alcoff notes\nthe existence, but foregoes the analysis, of a reactionary, right-wing\nwhite double consciousness, claiming it lacks any significant\nfact-based theoretical basis for critical argument.) White double\nconsciousness is a specific kind of disaffection with whiteness, an\nalienation from whiteness as norm, \u201ca turmoil in white\nsubjectivity\u201d (174).\n\nThe crisis of white hegemony results partly from demographic changes\nunder way that will transform the U.S. into a\n\u2018minority-majority\u2019 society by mid-century, and an\nacknowledgment of these impending changes by white Americans still\nable and willing to face social reality. These demographic shifts\nportend a shifting spectrum of political contestation. Citing the work\nof historian Nell Irvin Painter charting the historic formation of\nwhiteness, Alcoff\u2019s argument identifies other broader social and\npolitical changes to U.S. society that track what might be called\n\u2018the declining significance of whiteness\u2019. These include a\ndiminished capacity of white identity to secure for its possessors the\ndifferential advantages once available to them; an increasing\ncontestation in the terms of public discourse on race, given changes\nin the federal government\u2019s identification and counting of race\ncategories, and recent theoretical uncertainties in academic and\njournalistic writing about race categories; a declining possibility of\nliving in whites-only communities and for restricting one\u2019s\ndaily life to segregated spaces; the end of state-sanctioned racial\nhierarchy, enabling the increasing openness of new generations of\nwhites to interracial contact, interaction, relationships, families,\nand multiracial community.\n\nAlcoff\u2019s focus on these and other actual social conditions\nforming the matrix for white double consciousness resembles Du\nBois\u2019s own increasing attention to the \u2018environing\nconditions\u2019 materially grounding changes in double consciousness\nin the developing century of his life. Whiteness is not an ideology\nfor Alcoff, but an \u2018organically emergent\u2019 social reality.\nAlcoff takes as a given both the fluidity of all such racial\ndeterminations of identity and the relative stability of the lived,\nmaterial reality of whiteness. Her broader account is aimed to counter\nrecent arguments that whiteness is too closely tied to white supremacy\nin its origins and motivations to be freed from its racist past, on\nthe one hand, and, on the other, that it is an ideological formation\nwhich can be simply given up and left behind as part of the struggle\nto overcome that historic legacy. Rejecting these claims, she argues\nwhiteness may well be de-linked from racism and white supremacy, a\npossibility that white double consciousness prefigures in its\nspecific, binary form.\n\nThe ideology of \u2018white vanguardism,\u2019 which Alcoff\ncharacterizes as the \u201cillusion \u2026 that has configured\nEuropean whites as the scientific, technological, moral, artistic, and\npolitical leader of the human race\u201d (24), has increasingly lost\nplausibility to significant numbers of whites themselves. This\n\u2018illusion,\u2019 which once supplied some sense of dignity and\nsocial standing to the many whites without other cultural or economic\nresources, has been increasingly contested both in the academy and the\npublic forum, and is at odds with changing social realities. Thus,\nwhite double consciousness is a growing reflection in significant\nsections of the population of the deep crisis of whiteness. At the\nsame time, Alcoff argues, whites affected with double consciousness\nare living out their disillusion with their own previous white\nvanguardist assumptions.\n\nAlcoff relies on a variety of sources to support her account. These\ninclude, in addition to philosophical critiques of the racial\nformation and of whiteness, ethnographic studies of local white\ncommunities, narrative accounts of anti-racist and anti-klan activists\nin the South and episodes from her own life and experience. She\npresents as a paradigmatic case the \u2018Beat\u2019 writer Jack\nKerouac \u2013 who exemplified the anxiety about whiteness in the\nform of a lived creative artistic rebellion, one nonetheless\nidentified by the culture as racially white. Alcoff characterizes\nKerouac as exhibiting such white double consciousness in his\ndeportment and self-presentation, saying that his \u2018alienated\nconsciousness\u2019 \u201cmanifested as discomfort with his embodied\nidentity.\u201d She adds that:\n\n\nJack Kerouac expressed a poignant alienation from his white identity\nand the general normative whiteness of heterosexual suburbia, and he\nemphatically identified with the more intense existential registers of\nnonwhite affect that he took to be common among African Americans and\nMexicans. (169)\n\n\nAnother noteworthy example is the description by Simone de Beauvoir of\nher own experience, during a visit with Richard Wright in New York, as\na white person walking through Harlem and experiencing a measure of\ndiscomfort on confronting the accusatory glances of the\nneighborhood\u2019s residents. \u201cBeauvoir notes the hostile\nglances and feels herself \u2018stiffen with a bad\nconscience\u2019\u201d (139). This provides Alcoff with an example\nillustrating the role that reactive emotions such as guilt and shame\ncan have in triggering the formation of white double consciousness.\nSuch encounters with racialized others in conditions of daily life can\nprod whites into seeing the disparity between how they view themselves\nand how they are seen outside of their own segregated communities, as\nthey begin to \u201cintuit how they are viewed by nonwhite\nothers\u201d (170). For many whites, Alcoff argues, the guilt and\ndiscomfort with whiteness which results provokes a critical rethinking\nand attempt to reshape their identity even as, for others, it drives a\ndesire to escape the attribution of racial whiteness altogether, an\nultimately dead-end path.\n\nA growing disaffection with the mainstream condition of whiteness\n\u2013 and with its dependence on the ideology of \u2018white\nvanguardism\u2019 \u2013 is the core of white double consciousness\nfor Alcoff. It is linked, for many whites, with a close daily lived\nassociation with communities of brown and black people. Nonetheless,\nan honest, fact-based and realistic approach to their lives requires\ntheir acknowledging the actuality of whiteness as their own personal\nracial identity and their understanding it as an historically shifting\nsocial construct. Acknowledging whiteness as a social construct\ninvolves both accepting its connection with historical and ongoing\nbrutal racial oppression and questioning its core ideology of white\nvanguardism. The double consciousness this acceptance/suspicion\nelicits involves, to some extent, a self-ascription of whiteness as\nidentity, a critical distance from it as a form of life, and a\nrejection of its \u2018white vanguardist\u2019 ideology as false,\nand falsely justifying continued white supremacy.\n\nWhite double consciousness can lead whites to a deeper understanding\nof the realities of U.S. social conditions and the history shaping\nthem. It thus represents a resource and potentially a trigger for\nworking through their false views about race and moving toward\nanti-racism. Unlike the case of black double consciousness \u2013\nwhich is the native understanding of their own lives, achieved through\nintraracial communal cultural associations and solidarities, that\nmakes possible blacks\u2019 understanding of the lies upholding white\ndomination \u2013 whites\u2019 double consciousness \u201cinvolves\ncoming to see themselves through both the dominant and non-dominant\nlens and recognizing the latter as a critical corrective truth\u201d\n(140).\n5.3 Kaleidoscopic Consciousness\n\nAlcoff\u2019s reflections on whiteness and white double consciousness\ncome in the wake of her arguments for transcending the black/white\nbinary in Visible Identities. Jos\u00e9 Medina does Alcoff\none better, in a sense, by opening up the possibility of a\nmultiplicitous version of double consciousness as an epistemic tactic\nin the struggle for a more expansive democratic society.\n\nMedina discusses double consciousness \u2013 and its hypothetical\nmultiplicitous twin \u2013 in relation to his core argument, in\nEpistemic Resistance (2013), about the epistemic conditions\nof democratic citizenship and participation, that \u201ca crucial\npart of th[e] perfectionist ongoing struggle toward democracy is the\nresistance against epistemic injustices\u201d (4). \u2018Epistemic\ninjustice\u2019 is the term Medina takes from Miranda Fricker\u2019s\nnaming and analysis of that phenomenon, referring most broadly to a\n\u2018credibility deficit\u2019 \u2013 the discrediting of the\ntestimony or epistemic contributions of persons on the basis of their\nracial, gender, or other elements of \u2018visible identity\u2019.\nMedina\u2019s project is to develop methods to resist the domination\nof such oppressive epistemic circumstances.\n\nAddressing Du Bois\u2019s 1903 formulation, Medina argues that double\nconsciousness is inadequate for addressing the diverse forms of\nracialization of experience in the contemporary U.S., in which a\nmultiplicity of racially oppressed groups exist, as well as other\ngroups facing various other oppressions, on the basis of gender,\nsexuality, and other aspects of identity. The theory of democratic\nresistant consciousness Medina develops is also expansive in aiming to\nencompass the epistemic effects of not only racial but also gender,\nclass, sexual, and other forms of oppression, and the forms of\nepistemic injustice related to these, and so it necessarily transcends\nDu Bois\u2019 binary conception. Medina thus invokes a multiplicitous\nconsciousness \u2013 he actually dubs it \u2018kaleidoscopic\u2019\n\u2013 instead, but one that shares crucial similarities in profile\nwith Du Bois\u2019s original conception.\n\nMedina\u2019s conceptualizations emerge out of a pragmatist approach\nto democratic political theory. He assumes that the achievement of\nprogressive democratic socio-political objectives involves prolonged\nperiods of struggle, in which oppressive ideologies continue to exert\ntheir influence on social agents. Democratic activists \u2013 and,\nindeed, all moral agents in such circumstances \u2013 must therefore\ndevelop and use strategies of epistemic resistance to the deleterious\neffects of oppressive structures on their own internal patterns of\nresponse to racialized and \u2018othered\u2019 social actors\ngenerally. These forms of structural silencing and social ignorance\nfoster internalized blockages impeding agents\u2019 self-awareness,\nblockages which not only impair cognition but also impact the\nsensibilities, feelings, and imaginations of those agents as well.\nBecause he, as theorist, pragmatically adopts as well an activist\nperspective, Medina\u2019s concerns are not only diagnostic. He\ndevelops normative proposals for democratic forms of\n\u2018resistant\u2019 epistemic practices.\n\nMedina interprets Du Bois\u2019s account of double consciousness as\nan indication of how oppressed subjects can utilize their social\nposition to achieve a kind of clarity about both their own position\n\u2013 as having internalized the false dominant viewpoint about them\n\u2013 as well as about the position of those beneficiaries of\noppression \u2013 the ignorance and lack of self-knowledge of those\nin the dominant group itself. This is because those who are subject to\noppression have, as a function of double consciousness, access to both\nsocial viewpoints, and also are compelled by their situation to\nquestion the basis of their social standing and their\nself-understanding in a way those in the dominant positions are not.\nIndeed, according to Medina, those situated in the position of\noppressors, or who benefit from the oppressive regime, are often\n\u2018actively ignorant\u2019 \u2013 that is, ignorant in a way\ntheir own mode of life and activity helps to maintain and reproduce\n\u2013 of the basis and consequences of their standing and the social\ncontext of their own lives.\n\nTo bring about the epistemic resistance required, Medina argues for an\nepistemic stance he terms \u201ckaleidoscopic consciousness\u201d.\nThis is Medina\u2019s expanded version of Du Boisian double\nconsciousness, now explicitly presented as a norm of epistemic\npractice rather than an account of a pre-given social reality.\nKaleidoscopic consciousness involves an open, always anticipatory\nstance toward the possibility of new forms of oppressive social\nrelations and their related modes of \u2018active ignorance.\u2019\nSince forms of active ignorance as Medina calls them are in a sense\nself-fulfilling, blinding one to their own existence, and producing\nwhat he calls \u2018meta-blindness\u2019 \u2013 it is always\npossible \u2013 in some cases likely \u2013 that there are forms of\nblindness one suffers from without even knowing that fact.\n\nThis counter-hegemonic project is not confined to a reform of the\nindividual\u2019s consciousness alone: it involves a corresponding\nrecognition of and commitment to open, exploratory, and conscious\ninteractions with diverse social \u2018others.\u2019 Virtuous\nepistemic agents must be guided by what Medina calls an\n\u2018imperative of epistemic interaction,\u2019 of attunement to\nand reliance on regular encounters with those who are\n\u2018othered,\u2019 in various ways, by the system. This set of\nextended and socially distributed interactions is aimed at producing\nepistemic friction as a necessary condition for an adequate epistemic\norientation to the diversity of agents\u2019 viewpoints, and to\nresisting the diverse forms of socially functional blindness to the\nperspectives of socially \u2018othered\u2019 persons. Such\nunderstanding is a key component of a successful democratic political\nproject, according to Medina, and can only be achieved through what is\nitself a form of socially transformative epistemic practice.\n6. Conclusion\n\nAny account of double consciousness rooted in the sweep of Du\nBois\u2019s writings must acknowledge his taking it as both a state\nof consciousness of individual African-Americans as members of an\noppressed group and also as a form of social recognition of the status\nof that group in the wider culture. Such an account must also confront\nthe glaringly peculiar fact of the singular use of the term by Du Bois\ndespite his revisiting in his writing, on various occasions in\ndifferent contexts of publication, what seems to be an increasingly\nexpansive repertoire of similar or closely related phenomena.\n\nDu Bois gave up the moniker \u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d,\narguably, for a variety of reasons, but in part to resist the\nimpression that this is simply and only a problem of\nconsciousness, a problem only of and for black folk,\nunconnected with any palpable social facts. Also, as we have seen, the\nclose association of some of the original senses of\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d with pathological psychic states,\nmay have given Du Bois pause after his initial use of the term. He\nalso increasingly wanted to distance himself from the idea \u2013\nexplicitly rejected in Dusk of Dawn \u2013 that\ncollectivities are entities with their own consciousnesses, reified in\nwhat he came to regard as mistaken idealist overreach. Finally, Du\nBois seems to have opened up and expanded the range of phenomena\nrelated to double consciousness beyond the exemplar in the 1903\ntexts.\n\nBut Du Bois did not characterize the matter succinctly in one place so\nas to embrace both all its effects on consciousness and affect\nand the correlative reality of an \u2018environing\u2019\ncondition. Rather, he employs, alternately, two strategies of writing\nto capture its fullness. He presents first- and third-personal\naccounts of \u201cwhat it is like\u201d, \u201cspiritually\u201d,\nto live subject to double consciousness, through autobiographical\nwriting or by personifying the feelings, attitudes, and thoughts\nassociated with double consciousness in fictional or composite\ncharacters. And he describes social environments along with the\n\u201ccustoms\u201d and \u201cirrational\u201d,\n\u201csubconscious\u201d attitudes and modes of being typical of\nsocial groups living in those environments.\n\nNear the end of his life, in the posthumously published\nAutobiography, Du Bois revisited his original formulation of\n\u201ctwo-ness\u201d:\n\nI began to feel that dichotomy which all my life has characterized my\nthought: how far can love for my oppressed race accord with love for\nthe oppressing country? And when these loyalties diverge, where shall\nmy soul find refuge? (1968: 169)\n\n\nThis passage relates the feelings triggered in young Du Bois while\nobserving \u201cthe pageantry and patriotism of Germany in\n1892\u201d. This plainly autobiographical formulation in no way\nsuggests anything like a basic psychic split; it reflects an\nambivalence, a conflict of affections and loyalties within an integral\nself.\n\nAll previous critical attention has been fixed steadily on the\nspiritual aspect of the phenomena of double consciousness, virtually\nnone on the environing conditions Du Bois saw as giving rise to it.\nThose environing conditions might be summed up thus:\n\na social and political regime grounded in oppression and the\nmaintenance of vastly unequal and segregated living conditions of\nsocial groups ideologically and culturally identified as racially\ndistinct and unequal, creating a \u201cdouble environment\u201d\ninimical to members of the subordinate racial group.\n\n\nThe spiritual correlate of these environing conditions would\ninclude some combination of at least some of these sorts of emergent\naspects:\n\nharboring a view of oneself premised on false, demeaning, or\nderogatory estimations of one\u2019s capabilities, preferences,\naptitudes and desires \u2013 estimations made primarily or\nexclusively due to one\u2019s racial identity \u2013 and a\nconsequent determination of a life course and practical orientation to\none\u2019s goals and to others based upon those estimations;\na tendency to confuse two distinct sets of attitudes, feelings,\nand beliefs about oneself and one\u2019s disfavored racial group, to\nbeing \u201call mixed up\u201d and/or in a state of\ndouble-mindedness, ambivalence, inner turmoil or indecision in\nrelation to conflicting or opposed views and feelings about oneself\nand/or one\u2019s social situation;\nan awareness of oneself as characterized by others in an\nunfavorable or demeaning way in keeping with disparaging descriptors\nassociated with one\u2019s racial identity;\na reflective confrontation with a stable social situation\ncharacterized by consistent disparities in the life-prospects,\nachievements, social station, power, wealth, and cultural recognition\ntypically available to members of one\u2019s race relative to a\ndominant race;\na consciousness of and feelings related to a tension associated\nwith being taken for, or acting as, a member or representative of a\ndevalued race to members of the dominant race, in either a cultural,\nsocial, or a political capacity;\na practical attitude or orientation, for strategic purposes\nrelated to the pursuit of socially recognized goods or personal goals,\ninvolving the ascription to others of beliefs, intentions,\nexpectations or reactions to one\u2019s acts or words predicated on a\nfalsely degrading, fearful, or dismissive judgment of who or what one\nis, on the basis of one\u2019s race, and revision or adjustment of\none\u2019s plans on the basis of such ascriptions;\na pervasive sense of uncertainty regarding the reception of\noneself, one\u2019s activities and projects by others, under the\nweight of inappropriate, prejudicial, false and/or demeaning\ngeneralizations based on one\u2019s race;\nthe experience of a feeling or feelings of despair, rage, anger,\nfrustration, distress, or some combination of these, arising from and\nin keeping with recognition or awareness of any of the sorts of\nexperiences listed above.\n\n\nThis list, while including the sense of\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d as Du Bois develops the idea in\nSouls (particularly the first three items), also expands the\nsense of \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d to include more active,\npractical, and critical appropriations of the situation established by\nthe color line. Finally, and in this practical spirit, Medina has put\n\u2018kaleidoscopic consciousness\u2019 forward as an activist,\nresistant form of epistemic sensitivity to the socially corrosive\neffects of the multiplicitous oppressive structures in modern\nsocieties.\n",
