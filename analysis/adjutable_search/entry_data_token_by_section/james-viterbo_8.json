    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy (The Doctrine of Seminal Reasons)\n4. Natural Philosophy (The Doctrine of Seminal Reasons)\n\nThe belief that matter contains the \u2018seeds\u2019 of all the\nforms that can possibly accrue to it is one of the hallmarks of James\nof Viterbo\u2019s thought, as is the belief that the soul\npre-contains, in the shape of \u201cfitnesses\u201d\n(idoneitates), all the sensitive, intellective, and\nvolitional forms it is able to take on, though, as we will see, there\nis an important difference between both cases. I will present\nJames\u2019 doctrine of \u201cfitnesses\u201d in the intellect in\n Section 6,\n and his doctrine of fitnesses in the will in\n Section 6.\n In this section, I review James\u2019 arguments in favor of seminal\nreasons (For a full account see Pickav\u00e9 and C\u00f4t\u00e9\n2018). \n\nJames takes as the point of departure of his analysis of change the\nview commonly attributed to Aristotle by the medievals according to\nwhich substantial change involves a natural agent educing a form from\nthe potency of matter. His contention is that for the form to be\neduced from prime matter it has to preexist in prime matter in an\n\u201cincipient or inchoate\u201d state. Otherwise the forms would\nhave to be put into matter by an external cause. That cause could only\nbe a natural agent or a supernatural one. It cannot be the latter, for\nthen change would no longer be natural; but nor can it be the former\nbecause James holds that forms do not \u201cmigrate\u201d from one\nsubstance to another. Hence the forms must preexist in matter. \n\nJames holds that the inchoate form present in matter is the same as\nthe full-fledged, actualized form, differing from it only modally\n(Quodl. II, q. 5, p. 70, 386\u2013388). To the objection\nthat if this were true nothing \u201cnew\u201d would result from the\nprocess of change, he responded by pointing out that the assumption\nthat natural change results in the emergence of new things is rejected\nby no less an authority than Averroes himself, who denies that natural\nagents \u201cinduce something extrinsic in matter\u201d\n(Quodl. II, q. 5, p. 77, 621). What newness does result from\nnatural change is accounted for by the modal difference between the\npotential and the actualized form.\n\nJames holds that natural change requires two active principles: that\nof the potential form existing in potency in matter, i.e., the seminal\nreason, and that of the extrinsic natural agent acting on the matter.\nHe explicitly denies that the potential form on its own is a\nsufficient cause of change (Quodl. II, q. 5, p. 89,\n1012\u20131014). The first active principle is that of the inchoate\nform itself: it is active \u201cby means of inclination\u201d, that\nis, it is active inasmuch as it naturally tends to its actualization.\nThe second active principle is the extrinsic agent that educes the\nform from matter; it is active by means of transmutation,\ni.e., by efficiently causing the change by virtue of the power of\nacting (virtus agendi) conferred upon it by God. Both causes\ncooperate in the production of the effect.\n\nAlthough James teaches that there are preexisting ideas and volitions\nin the soul similarly to the way in which seminal reasons preexist in\nmatter, there is an important difference between the two cases. For\nthe \u201cinclining principles\u201d in matter, he explains in\nQuodl. III, q. 4 (p. 70, 416\u2013424), stand farther from\ntheir actualization than do the inclining principles in the soul. They\nthus require more on the part of the extrinsic transmutative cause\nthan do the soul\u2019s inclining principles. So much so, James\nexplains, that it sometimes appears that all the work is being done by\nthe extrinsic agent. This is not so, of course, as the\n\u201cintrinsic inclining principle\u201d also plays a role. Because\nJames assigns such an important role to external agent causes in his\naccount of natural change, one of the common complaints directed\nagainst theories of seminal reasons, namely that they deny the reality\nof secondary causes, clearly does not apply to his version of the\ntheory. \n\nJames\u2019 doctrine of seminal reasons would elicit considerable\ncriticism in the early fourteenth century and beyond (Phelps 1980).\nThe initial reaction came from Dominicans. Bernard of Auvergne wrote a\nseries of Impugnationes (i.e., refutations) contra\nJacobum de Viterbio (see Pattin 1962 and C\u00f4t\u00e9 2016),\nattacking various aspects of James\u2019 metaphysics, including his\ntheory of seminal reasons; and John of Naples later argued against\nJames\u2019 distinction between the potency of matter and matter \ntout court.  James\u2019 theory also encountered resistance from\nwithin the Augustinian Order, e.g., from Alphonsus Vargas of Toledo.\nEven arts masters entered the fray. The Milanese arts master Maino de\nMaineri devoted a lengthy section of one of his questions in his\nquestion-commentary on Averroes\u2019 De substantia orbis\ndating from 1315\u20131317 to a presentation and rebuttal of James\u2019\ntheory of natural change (see C\u00f4t\u00e9 2019). \n",
