    "main_text": "Correctness\n7. Correctness\n\nEach of the different approaches on software verification examined in\nthe previous section assumes a different understanding of correctness\nfor software. Standardly, correctness has been understood as a\nrelation holding between an abstraction and its implementation, such\nthat it holds if the latter fulfills the properties formulated by the\nformer. Once computational systems are described as having a layered\nontology, correctness needs to be reformulated as the relation that\nany structural level entertains with respect to its functional level\n(Primiero, 2020). Hence, correctness can still be considered as a\nmathematical relationship when formulated between abstract and\nfunctional level; while it can be considered as an empirical\nrelationship when formulated between the functional and the\nimplementation levels. One of the earlier debates in the philosophy of\ncomputer science (De Millo et al. 1979; Fetzer 1988) was\nindeed around this distinction.\n",
