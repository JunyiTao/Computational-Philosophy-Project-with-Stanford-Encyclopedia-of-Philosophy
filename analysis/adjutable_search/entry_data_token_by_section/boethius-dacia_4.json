    "main_text": "Philosophy || Language\n3.2 Language\n\nBoethius is a towering figure among the so-called\n\u201cmodists\u201d, the thinkers in whose linguistic theory\nmodus significandi \u201cmode/way of signifying\u201d is a\ncentral concept. On modism and Boethius\u2019 linguistic theory in\ngeneral, the fundamental works are Pinborg 1967, Rosier\n(Rosier-Catach) 1983, and Marmo 1994. Also important is Beuerle\n2010.\n\nThere is no clear starting date for modism, and it only gradually\ndisappears in the late Middle Ages, but the height of creativity was\nreached in the last third of the thirteenth century. The basic idea is\nsimple: the verb \u201cto run\u201d and the noun \u201ca run\u201d\nsignify the same \u201cthing\u201d, but in different ways. This\ncould be generalized to cover cases like the concrete\n\u201cwhite\u201d and the abstract \u201cwhiteness\u201d, as well\nas other parts of speech than just nouns and verbs: \u201ca\npain\u201d \u201cit hurts\u201d \u201churting\u201d\n\u201cpainfully\u201d \u201couch!\u201d could all be seen as\nhaving a common significate, only signified in different ways.\nSimilarly, the different cases of a noun, or the different tenses or\npersons of a verb could be described as different ways of signifying\n(modi significandi) the same, and in general all grammatical\ncategories could be understood to be based on different modi\nsignificandi. Add to this (a) a series of rules about how two\nwords may be construed with each other in a sentence depending on\nwhich modes of signifying they possess, and (b) the assumption that at\nbottom all languages share the same grammar with the same repertoire\nof modes of signifying, and you have a fairly strong linguistic\ntheory.\n\nThe claim about the identity of grammar across languages is based on\nthe assumption that (1) all humans conceptualize external reality in\nthe same way, even though they express their concepts in ways that are\nculture dependent (as taught by Aristotle in De\ninterpretatione 1); and (2) that this conceptualization does not\nonly result in core concepts like run, pain but also in an awareness\nof different modifications of the core things underlying the concepts,\ndifferent modi essendi \u201cmodes of being\u201d. This\nawareness, in turn, means that we harbor different corresponding\nmodi intelligendi \u201cways of understanding\u201d, that\nwe can then encode in sound, creating words with different modi\nsignificandi. How this encoding is done, is a matter of\nconvention, as Boethius repeatedly stresses. What one language\nexpresses by means of case endings, e.g., may be lexicalized in\nanother; the difference is only skin-deep (\u201caccidental\u201d),\nhe holds. He may have held that all languages actually have the\nresources for expressing all reality-based modes of signifying; at\nleast he held that all languages hold the potential for so doing. One\nof the consequences of Boethius\u2019 views is that although grammar\nmaps the ways in which words may signify, it does not allow one to\npredict what any actual word in any language means, and whatever some\nword means is irrelevant for its grammatical categorization:\n\u201cchimera\u201d and \u201cnothing\u201d are nouns as truly as\n\u201chorse\u201d and \u201cthing\u201d, for grammar is about\nhow, not what, words signify. Boethius\u2019\nconception of grammar as a science of linguistic structure, not\ncontent, was matched by a similar conception of logic (Ebbesen\n2016).\n\nSome of Boethius\u2019 contemporaries considered the step from modes\nof being to modes of understanding to be so automatic that they\nclaimed that the two types of mode were fundamentally identical.\nBoethius disagreed. According to him, there is not an exact one-to-one\ncorrespondence between features of external things and their\nreflections in the intellect. The intellect has a certain degree of\nfreedom. It can grasp the same mode of being in two slightly different\nways. Thus the same real property (mode of being) can give rise to the\nmode of understanding that results in the mode of signifying of a\nproper name and to the \u201cintention\u201d (concept) of a\nparticular; and similarly with the mode of signifying of an\nappellative name and the intention of a universal. The intentions, in\nturn, are the basis for \u201clocal habitudes\u201d (habitudines\nlocales), i.e., relationships between them, such as that between\nthe particular and the universal, which can be fleshed out in rules\nabout inferences. Thus, in some cases the same feature of reality may\nbe reflected in grammar and in logic, but somewhat differently (more\ndetails in Ebbesen 2016 and Green-Pedersen 1984: 228\u201330).\n\nWhile holding that the signification of words reflects our concepts,\nBoethius rejected the time-honoured notion that words signify concepts\ndirectly and things indirectly. In his view, they directly signify\nwhatever the corresponding concepts are concepts of\n(Mora-M\u00e1rquez 2014, 2015).\n",
