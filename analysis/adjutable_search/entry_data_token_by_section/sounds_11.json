    "main_text": "Aspatial Theories\n4. Aspatial Theories\n\nWe divided up existing accounts of sounds according to the spatial\nlocation they assign to sounds. However, there are aspatial theories\nof sounds as well. Aspatial theories deny either (i) that sounds are\nintrinsically spatial, or (ii) that auditory perception is\nintrinsically spatial. Arguably, claim (i) implies claim (ii), but the\nconverse is not true, which leaves room for an interesting aspatial\ntheory of auditory perception which nevertheless acknowledges that\nsounds have some spatial locations.\n",
