    "main_text": "Applications || Virtual worlds, games, and interactive fiction\n10.6 Virtual worlds, games, and interactive fiction\n\nText-based adventure (quest) games, such as Dungeons and Dragons, Hunt\nthe Wumpus (in its original version), and Advent began to be developed\nin the early and middle 1970s, and typically featured textual\ndescriptions of the setting and challenges confronting the player, and\nallowed for simple command-line input from the player to select\navailable actions (such as \u201copen box\u201d, \u201ctake\nsword\u201d or \u201cread note\u201d). While the descriptions of\nthe settings (often accompanied by pictures) could be quite elaborate,\nmuch as in adventure fiction, the input options available to the\nplayer were, and have largely remained, restricted to simple\nutterances of the sort that can be anticipated or collected in\npre-release testing by the game programmers, and for which responses\ncan be manually prepared. Certainly more flexible use of NL (\n\u201cfend off the gremlin with the sword!\u201d, \u201cIf I give\nyou the gold, will you open the gate for me?\u201d) would enliven the\ninteraction between player and the game world and the characters in\nit. In the 1980s and 90s text-based games declined in favor of games\nbased primarily on graphics and animation, though an online\ninteractive fiction community grew over the years that drove the\nevolution of effective interactive fiction development software. A\nhighly touted program (in the year 2000) was Emily Short's\n\u2018Galatea\u2019, which enabled dialogue with an animated\nsculpture. However, this is still an elaborately scripted program,\nallowing only for inputs that can be heuristically mapped to one of\nvarious preprogrammed responses. Many games in this genre also make\nuse of chatbot-like input-output response patterns in order to gain a\nmeasure of robustness for unanticipated user inputs.\n\n\nThe most popular PC video games in the 1990s and beyond were Robyn and\nRand Miller's Myst, a first-person adventure game, and Maxis Software's\nThe Sims, a life-simulation game. Myst, though relying on messages in\nbooks and journals, was largely nonverbal, and The Sims' chief\ndeveloper, Will Wright, finessed the problem of natural language\ndialogue by having the inhabitants of SimCity babble in Simlish, a\nnonsense language incorporating elements of Ukrainian, French and\nTagalog.\nCommercial adventure games and visual novels continue to rely on\nscripted dialogue trees\u2014essentially branching alternative\ndirections in which the dialogue can be expected to turn, with\nELIZA-like technology supporting the alternatives. More sophisticated\napproaches to interaction between users and virtual characters are\nunder development in various research laboratories, for example at the\nCenter for Human Modeling and Simulation at the University of\nPennsylvania, and the USC-affiliated Institute for Creative\nTechnologies. While the dialogues in these scenarios are still based\non carefully designed scripts, the interpretation of the user's spoken\nutterances exploits an array of well-founded techniques in speech\nrecognition, dialogue management, and reasoning. Ongoing research can\nbe tracked at venues such as IVA (Intelligent Virtual Agents), AIIDE\n(AI and Interactive Digital Entertainment), and AAMAS (Autonomous\nAgents and Multiagent Systems).\n",
