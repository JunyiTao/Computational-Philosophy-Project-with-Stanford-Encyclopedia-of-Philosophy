    "main_text": "Difficulties and Objections || Internal consistency\n11.1 Internal consistency\nThe issue of internal consistency has been raised\nby Kent (1997) and\nby Bassi & Ghirardi (1999, 2000) on\nthe grounds that the rules for reasoning using histories, summarized\nin section 5, lead to contradictions: certain\nassumptions allow one to derive both a proposition and its\ncontradiction. Equivalently, a quantum property can be assigned, on\nthe basis of the same initial data, probabilities of both 0 and\n1. These criticisms have been answered\nin Griffiths & Hartle (1998) and in \nGriffiths (2000a, 2000b).\nIn addition there is a general argument for the\nconsistency of the histories approach in Ch. 16\nof Griffiths (2002a). The key point,\neasily overlooked as it has no close analogy in classical physics, is\nthe single framework rule R3 of section 5. In\nsituations that involve quantum properties at a single time the use of\na single framework means the use of a particular projective\ndecomposition of the identity and the associated Boolean event\nalgebra. When reasoning is restricted to this algebra the usual rules\nof propositional logic apply, so an inconsistency at this level would\nimply the inconsistency of standard logic. If the framework in\nquestion consists of a family of histories of a closed system, it\ncannot be assigned probabilities using the extended Born\nrule, subsection 4.2, unless the consistency\nconditions are satisfied. But in those cases where probabilities can\nbe assigned they satisfy the usual rules of probabilistic reasoning,\nthus ruling out contradictions.\n",
