    "main_text": "Life and Works || The Character of the Meditations\n1.1 The Character of the Meditations\n\n\nMarcus\u2019 Meditations reads very differently from other ancient Greek and Roman \nphilosophical texts. Outside of Book I, which acknowledges various relatives and teachers for benefiting\nMarcus by being exemplars of some virtue or bearers of some useful\nlesson (and concludes by acknowledging the gods for providing him with such exemplars and with other circumstances conducive to his moral development), it is difficult even to tell how the work is organized, for\ninstance whether the order of the books and chapters is evidence of the order of events in Marcus\u2019 life or follows some logical or topical order,\nor whether the chapter divisions reflect breaks in Marcus\u2019\nthought. Marcus returns insistently to issues that must have arisen\nfrom his experiences, such as the imminence of death and his\nirritation with his associates\u2019 faults. Our own perennial concern with\nthese topics, Marcus\u2019 gift for vivid imagery, and the apparent\nextractability of individual sentences from the text given its lack of\nclear structure, have all contributed to making Marcus among the most\nquotable of philosophers. But the reader who wants to understand\nMarcus\u2019 thought as a whole is bound to be frustrated; sometimes\nreading Marcus feels like reading the sententiae-spoofing lines given to Hamlet\u2019s\nPolonius. Philosophical treatments of Marcus have to bring their own\nstructure to the work. \n\nWe may begin with the work\u2019s genre.  The first clear mention of Marcus Aurelius\u2019 Meditations in antiquity is by\nThemistius in the 4th c. CE, who calls it Marcus\u2019\n\u2018precepts\u2019 (parangelmata); in 900,\nSuidas\u2019 dictionary calls it a leading or directing\n(ag\u00f4g\u00ea) and the 10th-century bishop Arethas calls it \u2018the\n[writings] to himself\u2019 (ta eis\nheauton).[2]\nScholars now generally agree (following\nBrunt 1974) that Marcus wrote for his own moral improvement, to remind\nhimself of and render concrete the Stoic doctrines he wanted to live\nby, such as that the world is governed by Providence; that happiness\nlies in virtue, which is wholly in one\u2019s own power; and that one\nshould not be angry at one\u2019s associates but regard them as\nsiblings, offspring of the same God. While we do not have other\nexamples of this kind of private writing from antiquity, we do have\nEpictetus\u2019 advice to write down (as well as to rehearse) daily\nthe sorts of responses one ought to have to situations one encounters,\nso that one might have them ready at hand (procheiron) when\ncircumstances demand (Epictetus Discourses i.1.21\u201325, iv.1.111; cf.\niii.5.11, iii.26.39 on moral improvement being the appropriate aim of\nreading and writing). And Marcus describes his own writings as\nsupports (parast\u00eamata, iii.11), records\n(parap\u00eagmata, ix.3.2) and rules (kanones, v.22,\nx.2).\n\n\nMarcus\u2019 purpose of mentally equipping himself to deal with\nwhat comes his way explains the Meditations\u2019\noften aphoristic and sloganeering style (e.g. \u2018Erase\nimpressions!\u2019; \u2018Do nothing at random!\u2019;\n\u2018Those who now bury will soon be buried!\u2019): as Marcus\nsays, for the one who has been bitten by true doctrines even the\nbriefest saying suffices as a reminder (hupomn\u00easis) of\nfreedom from pain and fear (x.34). In i.7, Marcus speaks of\nreading Epictetus\u2019 \u2018hupomn\u00eamata\u2019; Arrian,\nwho wrote down Epictetus\u2019 teachings, named them \nhupomn\u00eamata,  apparently in reference to\nXenophon\u2019s Memorabilia (whose Greek title was \u2018hupomn\u00eamata\u2019) of Socrates. Marcus\u2019 purpose also explains why\nwhen Marcus refers to events in his life, he does not specify them in a\nway that would allow anyone else to identify them, and why he uses\ntechnical Stoic terminology without\n explanation.[3]\nMarcus\u2019 purpose also makes sense of his collecting sayings of philosophers without much scruple\nas to whether the philosophical system from which the sayings come is consistent\nwith Stoicism. Finally, this purpose suggests that the reader should look for the personal\nfaults that Marcus is trying to combat, or the correct\nattitude he is trying to inculcate, when he brings up some doctrine or\nargument, whether Stoic or not. So for example, xi.18, which\nbegins by saying that human beings came into the world for the sake of\neach other and that the metaphysical alternatives are atoms or Nature\n(see below, 4.1), is a list of ten prescriptions against anger, a particularly consequential failing in those with power (cf.\nix.42). Again, ix.28 invokes the Stoic doctrine of eternal\nrecurrence to bring to mind the insignificance of mortal things.\nThis suggests that despite the quotability of individual assertions in\nthe Meditations, we should approach them by studying their\n\u2018therapeutic\u2019 context, that is, by asking: what moral and\npsychological effects is Marcus trying to achieve by saying\nthis? When Marcus says \u2018p\u2019, he is not always simply\nexpressing his belief that p.\nBuilding on this point about the genre of the Meditations and seeking to establish its particular philosophical content, Hadot 1998 organizes Marcus\u2019 thoughts around the Epictetan disciplines of\n(i) desire, (ii) impulse and (iii) assent; according to Hadot, these\nappear in Marcus as the rules of (i) being contented with whatever\nhappens, (ii) conducting oneself justly towards others, and (iii)\nexercising discernment in one\u2019s judgments\n(35\u201336).[4] \nBy contrast Gill 2013 identifies four recurring \u2018strands\u2019\nin Marcus: (i) aspiration to an ethical ideal conceived in Stoic terms\nas the understanding that only virtue is good and that all human\nbeings are akin, which involves (ii) acceptance of death and\ntransience as features of our existence that are not up to us; both\n(i) and (ii) are enabled by (iii) our rationality and (iv) our\nsociality, two aspects of human nature that make us a special part of\nthe whole cosmos; according to Gill, Marcus assumes the Stoic theory\nof the ethical development of (iii) and (iv) by appropriation\n(oikei\u00f4sis) and focuses on its last stage, which is the\nbringing about of (i) by self-cultivation.\n\nThe approach taken in this article follows Hadot\u2019s (1998, 5) idea that\nfor the ancients philosophy was a way of life, and that Marcus\u2019\nMeditations show us what it was like for an individual to try to live a\nStoic life. However, rather than trying to cover all the themes\nin Marcus in this light\u2014in addition to the topics discussed\nbelow, he talks about time, fate, death, the cycles of change in the\ncosmos\u2014I focus on one basic question for Marcus\u2019 project of\nliving Stoically: what does a Stoic use to guide his own conduct?\nAddressing this basic question leads into discussion of the two virtues\nMarcus has the most to say about: justice and piety.\n",
