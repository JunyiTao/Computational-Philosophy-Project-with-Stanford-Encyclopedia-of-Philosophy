This objection says that the mind makes use of a\nrange of concepts which it could not have acquired, and which do not\noperate, through the senses: e.g., \u201cexistence,\u201d\n\u201csameness,\u201d \u201cdifference.\u201d So there is a part\nof thought, and hence of knowledge, which has nothing to do with\nperception. Therefore knowledge is not perception.\n\n\nUnitarians and Revisionists will read this last argument against\nD1 in line with their general\norientations. Unitarians will suggest that Socrates\u2019 range of concepts\ncommon to the senses is a list of Forms. They will point to the\nsimilarities between the image of the senses as soldiers in a wooden\nhorse that Socrates offers at 184d1 ff., and the picture of a\nHeracleitean self, existing only in its awareness of particular\nperceptions, that he drew at 156\u2013160.\n\n\nRevisionists will retort that there are important differences between\nthe Heracleitean self and the wooden-horse self, differences that show\nthat Heracleiteanism is no longer in force in 184\u2013187. They will\ninsist that the view of perception in play in 184\u2013187 is Plato\u2019s own\nnon-Heracleitean view of perception. Thus Burnyeat 1990: 55\u201356 argues\nthat, since Heracleiteanism has been refuted by 184, \u201cthe organs\nand subjects dealt with [in the Wooden Horse passage] are the ordinary\nstable kind which continue in being from one moment to the\nnext.\u201d On the other hand, notice that Plato\u2019s equivalent for\nBurnyeat\u2019s \u201corgans and subjects\u201d is the single word\naisth\u00easeis (184d2). On its own, the word can mean\neither \u201csenses\u201d or \u201csensings\u201d; but it seems\nsignificant that it was the word Plato used at 156b1 for one of the\ntwo sorts of Heracleitean \u201coffspring.\u201d Plato speaks of the\naisth\u00easeis concealed \u201cas if within a Wooden\nHorse\u201d as pollai tines (184d1), \u201cindefinitely\nmany.\u201d But while there are indefinitely many Heracleitean\nsensings, there are not, of course, indefinitely many\nsenses. Indeed even the claim that we have many\nsenses (pollai), rather than several\n(enioi, tines), does not sound quite right, either\nin English or in Greek. This is perhaps why most translators, assuming\nthat aisth\u00easeis means \u201csenses,\u201d put\n\u201ca number of senses\u201d for pollai tines\naisth\u00easeis. Perhaps this is a mistake, and what\naisth\u00easeis means here is \u201cHeracleitean\nsensings.\u201d  If so, this explains how the\naisth\u00easeis inside any given Wooden Horse can be\npollai tines.\n\n\nIf the aisth\u00easeis in the Wooden Horse are Heracleitean\nsensings, not ordinary, un-Heracleitean senses, this\nsupports the Unitarian idea that 184\u2013187 is contrasting Heracleitean\nperceiving of particulars with Platonic knowing of the Forms (or\nknowing of particulars via, and in terms of, the\nForms).\n\n\nAnother piece of evidence pointing in the same direction is the\nsimilarity between Plato\u2019s list of the \u201ccommon notions\u201d at\nTheaetetus 186a and closely contemporary lists that he gives\nof the Forms, such as the list of Forms (likeness,\nmultitude, rest and their opposites) given at\nParmenides 129d, with ethical additions at\nParmenides 130b. There are also the megista\ngen\u00ea (\u201cgreatest kinds\u201d) of Sophist\n254b\u2013258e (being, sameness, otherness,\nrest and change); though whether these\ngen\u00ea are Forms is controversial.\n",
