The Idea of Necessary Connection\n\nThe early modern causation debate revolved around a family of\n\u201cnearly synonymous\u201d key ideas, the most prominent of which\nwere the ideas of power and necessary connection.\nFor Hume, \u201cthere are no ideas, which occur in metaphysics, more\nobscure and uncertain\u201d. He showcases the critical and\nconstructive uses of his account of definition as he attempts\n\u201cto fix \u2026 the precise meaning of these terms\u201d, in\norder to \u201cremove some part of that obscurity, which is so much\ncomplained of in this species of philosophy\u201d (EHU\n7.1.3/61\u201362).\n",
