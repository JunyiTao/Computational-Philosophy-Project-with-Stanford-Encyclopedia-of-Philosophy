    "main_text": "Some versions of proof-theoretic semantics || Atomic systems\n2.6 Atomic systems\n\nProof-theoretic semantics is predominantly concerned with logical\nconstants. Even if one agrees with this orientation \u2014 the theory\nof definitional reflection (see section\n 2.3.2)\n is an exception to it \u2014 we must nonetheless fix the status of\natomic sentences and their proofs. In model-theoretic semantics the\ntruth of a logically complex sentence is defined with respect to a\nstructure, which is called a \u201cmodel\u201d of this sentence.\nThis structure determines, which atomic sentences are true and which\nare not. Whether a complex sentence is true hinges on its atomic\nconstituents. This is quite analogous in proof-theoretic semantics.\nWhether a proof of a complex sentence is valid depends on the atomic\nbase of the system under consideration. Here an atomic base is\nnormally considered a calculus for the generation of atomic sentences:\nProofs of atomic sentences in the atomic base are per se valid.\nSimilar to the model-theoretic definition of logical truth as truth\nwith respect to all structures, in proof-theoretic semantics one would\ndefine logically valid proofs as proofs which are valid with respect\nto all atomic bases.\n\nThere are various options which atomic systems should be considered to\nbe candidates for atomic bases. (1) The simplest would be Herbrand\nmodels as used in the theory of logic programming, which are just\ncollections of atomic sentences. Proof-theoretically, these would be\ncalculi consisting of axioms only, without proper rules of inference.\n(2) In the writings of Lorenzen (see section\n 2.1.1)\n and Prawitz (see section\n 2.2.2)\n atomic systems are considered lists of production rules, that is,\ncalculi with axioms and rules of the form \\(A_1,\\ldots,A_n \\Rightarrow\nB\\) allowing one to generate \\(B\\) from \\(A_1,\\ldots,A_n\\). (3) More\ninvolved systems may contain atomic rules that allow one to discharge\nassumptions, quite in analogy to logical rules such as implication\nintroduction. (4) Generalizing this idea one may admit rules for atoms\nthat discharge rules themselves, that is, rules of higher levels (see\nsection\n 2.1.3).\n (5) Even further advanced would be atomic systems that incorporate\nrules of definitional reflection (see section\n 2.3.2).\n \u2014 Many other sorts of rules for atoms constituting atomic\nsystems may be imagined.\n\nFor proof-theoretic semantics, the critical point here is that certain\nformal results depend on which types of atomic systems are admitted.\nThis holds in particular for the issue of semantical completeness (see\nsection\n 2.8).\n The investigation of which atomic systems, when taken as atomic bases\nof proof-theoretic semantics, lead to which formal system at the\nlogical level, has just begun (see Sandqvist 2015b; Piecha and\nSchroeder-Heister, 2016a; Stafford 2023, other internet resources). It\nshould be noted that this is an intensional feature of proof-theoretic\nsemantics: We are not just interested in which atoms are generated by\nthe various forms of atomic systems, but how this is done, that is, by\nwhich type of rules this is achieved. This is a crucial difference to\nmodel-theoretic semantics, which is purely extensional in this\nrespect. For further intensional features of proof-theoretic semantics\nsee section\n 3.7.\n",
