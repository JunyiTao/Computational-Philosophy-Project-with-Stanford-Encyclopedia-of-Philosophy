    "main_text": "The Second Period: An Encyclopedia of Philosophy || Ethical Theory\n6.2 Ethical Theory\n\nCicero\u2019s principal work on ethical theory, On Ends\nor On Moral Ends (in Latin De Finibus), offers\nperhaps the most vivid example of his use of the sceptical method to\nengage critically with questions about the nature of philosophy\nitself. The title abbreviates a longer Latin title (De Finibus\nBonorum et Malorum) whose meaning \u2013 literally, On Ends\nof Goods and Evils \u2013 raises puzzles of its own (on which\nsee Allen 2014), but refers, to simplify a little, to the question of\nwhat are the highest goods, the attainment of which will bring about a\nhappy human life. Cicero considers three leading ethical theories of\nhis day: Epicureanism, which proposes that pleasure is the highest\ngood; Stoicism, which holds that virtue is not just the highest but\nthe only good; and the theory of the so-called Old Academy, which,\nwhile including goods other than virtue within its conception of the\nsupreme good, ranks virtue higher than the rest. The structure of the\nwork is once again dialogical: for each theory, Cicero puts into the\nmouth of a proponent an exposition of that theory, followed by a\ncritical response delivered by Cicero himself.\n\nCicero allows himself a head start on the exposition of Epicurean\nhedonism by its proponent Torquatus with an initial, critical outline\nof the theory in Book 1. At 1.23\u201324 he appeals to the behaviour\nof two of Torquatus\u2019 ancestors, both stern military men who\ntreated their sons harshly (execution for cowardice and banishment for\ntaking bribes, respectively), behaviour which in Cicero\u2019s view\ncan only be explained by their having put the wider public interest\nahead of their own pleasure, contrary to Epicurean prescription.\n\nCicero chooses examples that, in combining military with family, evoke\ncore ancient Roman values. Torquatus then defends his ancestors\u2019\nbehaviour in terms compatible with Epicurean theory. Focusing in\nparticular on the first Torquatus, he argues that he acted to uphold\nhis authority at a time of war, and therefore to enhance his own\nsecurity and so, ultimately, pleasure. More striking than the details\nof Torquatus\u2019 explanation is that he feels the need to give it.\nWhy could he not have said that his ancestors were misguided and that\nit took later generations to see the Epicurean light? Torquatus says\nexplicitly that he has no reason to fear that he cannot\n\u2018accommodate\u2019 his ancestors to the Epicurean view (1.34).\nThat he rises to Cicero\u2019s challenge in this way indicates that\nancestral behaviour has normative force for him: his ancestors must be\nread as acting from (what he considers) the correct motives.\n\nInterestingly, it appears that Torquatus\u2019 own father was an\nEpicurean, whom Torquatus evidently admired. He reports with\nenthusiasm his father\u2019s rebuttal of a Stoic argument against\nhedonism (1.39); and, though this is not said explicitly, perhaps was\ninfluenced by his father in adopting Epicureanism himself. Cicero thus\nslyly reinforces the sense that ancestral piety is an ineliminable\npart of the value system that Torquatus shares. He has induced\nTorquatus to agree that it would be a problem for the\nvalidity of Epicurean ethics if it did not sit comfortably with the\nnorms of Roman culture. The reader is thus encouraged to reflect on\nwhether, and if so how, the abstract and general features of an\nethical theory are to fit with outlooks and practices which, at least\nin part, carry normative weight precisely because they represent\nadherence to a particular tradition: a strategy that Cicero further\ndeploys in his more lengthy critique of Epicurean ethics in Book 2\n(see Inwood 1990).\n\nHowever difficult it might be for Torquatus himself, it seems open to\nan Epicurean to respond that they have no obligation to simply accept\nRoman values as authoritative. Epicurean theory is professedly a\nradical one that sees most humans as having been corrupted by false\nvalues. What, then, should we, as non-Roman readers, make of\nCicero\u2019s discussion? Even if we accepted that he demonstrates an\nincompatibility between Roman and Epicurean values, it is not clear\nthat this should have any hold on us. We are surely both able and\nentitled to assess the Epicurean case on its own merits. On the other\nhand, we are no less the inheritors of cultural assumptions and\noutlooks than the Romans, even if ours are different, and even if the\n\u2018we\u2019 implied are a great and diverse plurality.\nDisentangling a thing\u2019s \u2018own merits\u2019 from the values\nwe bring to an encounter with it is neither a simple nor perhaps a\nviable task.\n\nThis is not of course to say that our perspectives cannot be changed\nby such philosophical encounters. Ethical theory, particularly of the\nprofessedly radical sort that many ancient philosophers propounded,\nwould hardly have a point if that were the case; and Cicero\u2019s\nproject of communicating such theories would be equally unintelligible\nin that light. But coming to a theory from outside of any perspective\nis unintelligible. What Cicero\u2019s holding up of\nEpicurean ethics against the canvas of Roman tradition conveys is a\npoint about how ethical theory in particular must conform, not so much\nto specific values and traditions, as to certain basic elements of\nwhat makes us human, without which it would be hard to discern how an\nethical theory could have purchase on us at all: above all, perhaps,\nour status as social creatures shaped by our relation to specific\nhistories and traditions.\n\nWhen it comes to Stoic theory, as laid out next by its spokesman Cato\nthe Younger, things look more promising. Cato was historically the\narch-defender of the traditional values of the Roman republic, while\nStoicism, with its emphasis on the supremacy of virtue and the value\nof political participation, seems on the face of it to conform to the\nRoman way much more readily than Epicureanism does. Nonetheless, the\nstringency of Stoic theory, which holds that virtue is the only good\nthing, and vice the only bad thing, and takes virtue not to admit of\ndegrees \u2013 without complete virtue one is not virtuous at all\n\u2013 allows Cicero to mount his critique.\n\nHe invites us to consider whether the Stoics have a theory which, in\nthe terms they express it, can be proclaimed in those contexts that\ndefine the sphere of public life for a Roman: courts, assembly, Senate\nhouse, and battlefield. A lawyer, observes Cicero, could not credibly\nconclude the case for the defence by declaring that the punishments of\nexile and confiscation were not evils, but merely to be\n\u2018rejected\u2019 (the Stoic technical term for aversion toward\nthings that nonetheless cannot affect one\u2019s happiness); nor\ncould an orator announce, with Hannibal at the gates, that captivity,\nenslavement, and death were no evils (4.22). Moreover, the Senate\nwould not be able to speak of Scipio Africanus\u2019 triumph as\nhaving been won by his valour, since he did not meet the standards of\nperfection required, in Stoic terms, for virtue (4.22).\n\nThis sort of objection seems especially damaging for the Stoics, with\ntheir emphasis on agency and public participation. In effect Cicero\nargues that the Stoics can have their integrity, or their theory, but\nnot both. They cannot express their doctrines about virtue in public\ncontexts without incurring ridicule or incomprehension. What they are\nleft with, according to Cicero, is hypocrisy: the use of ordinary\nlanguage in public, their own language in their writings (4.22).\n\nWhether or not Cicero is fair to the detail of Stoic and Epicurean\nethics, his aim, as exemplified by the dialogical structure, is to\nprovoke debate. In particular, his readers are invited to consider to\nwhat extent ethical theory must be answerable to social reality. Is\nnot an ethical theory that cannot be lived consistently thereby flawed\nas a theory? In keeping with this question, Cicero moves next to a\ntheory that seems on the face of it rather more congenial to lived\nexperience, with an exposition by his interlocutor Piso of the ethics\nof the Old Academy, broadly in line with what we now think of as\nAristotelian ethics.\n\nCrucially, this theory recognises a plurality of goods. Piso holds\nthat virtue is sufficient for happiness but that there are also bodily\ngoods such as health and freedom from pain, the possession of which,\nwhen added to virtue, will render the subject not just happy, as\nvirtue on its own does, but \u2018supremely happy\u2019 (5.71).\nCicero wonders whether treating such things as goods will not simply\nmean adopting the view of Aristotle\u2019s distinguished successor\nTheophrastus who, while providing a good deal of the resources for\nPiso\u2019s account (5.12), also acts as something of an outlier for\nhaving claimed that no life could be happy if caught up in pain or\nmisfortune (5.77).\n\nCicero asks Piso to consider whether, even if one were to allow that a\nsingle misfortune might not affect the happiness of the virtuous, an\naccumulation of them would: could someone wracked by pain, disease,\nand other misfortunes plausibly be thought of as happy, let alone\nhappiest? (5.84). Shrewdly turning against him the Aristotelian method\nof canvassing the views of both the many and the wise, to which Piso\nhad appealed at 5.63 in support of his view of the supremacy of\nvirtue, Cicero declares that ordinary folk would deny, and experts be\nunsure, that someone being tortured could be happy (5.85). Piso\nresponds by giving a more worked-out \u2018lexical\u2019 account of\nthe relation between virtue and the other goods, so as to underpin his\nview that virtue suffices for a happy (even if not for the happiest)\nlife: the smallest amount of excellence of character is ranked ahead\nof all bodily goods; and no foul-but-pleasant action is better than\nany honourable-but-painful one (5.93). Virtue can thus be equated with\nhappiness, while happiness can be enhanced through the addition of\nother goods (5.95).\n\nOne might think, however, that this theoretical tightening comes at a\ncost. The advantage of Piso\u2019s originally looser pluralism is\nthat it accords with the views about value of those who, as Cicero\nputs it, have never come across a philosopher even in a painting\n(5.80). Piso is allowed to reiterate the criticism \u2013 indicating\nits importance for Cicero \u2013 that the Stoics adopt one set of\nterms in real life and another in the lecture room (5.89). But when\nPiso asks disapprovingly whether philosophers should speak in a\ndifferent way from human beings (5.89), it is hard to avoid the\nthought that in his case the terminology of the street now dresses a\nmore rigid substance. In becoming full-fledged theory, his discourse\nis in danger of losing what made it distinctive and attractive as an\naccount of the good human life.\n\nCicero does not tell us which, if any, of the ethical theories that he\ndiscusses we should adopt. Matters are left explicitly unresolved at\nthe close of On Ends (5.95\u20136). Cicero, however, not\nonly offers us tools to think through the issues for ourselves, but in\nso doing, utilises the series of expositions and critiques that he\nlays out to raise pertinent questions, befitting the sceptical stance,\nabout the status of ethical theory itself.\n",
