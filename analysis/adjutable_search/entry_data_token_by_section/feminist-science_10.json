    "main_text": "Queer Science Studies and the New Materialisms\n5. Queer Science Studies and the New Materialisms\n\nSeveral ways of thinking about science that are closely related to or\nbuild on feminist perspectives have emerged in recent scholarship. Two\nof these will be discussed here. The first, queer science studies,\nprovides an extension of feminist thought in that it challenges the\ntraditional assumptions about gender, many of which are also targets\nof feminist work. Another, the \u201cnew materialisms\u201d,\nchallenges the idea that knowledge should be understood as\nrepresenting passive matter, arguing that such an analysis is not\nsufficiently attentive to the material aspects of embodiment. These\napproaches are related to each other (and to feminist perspectives) in\ntheir focus on the embodied nature of human subjects, and the\nimportance of lived experience as evidence (see also\n Biology and the New Materialisms).\n",
