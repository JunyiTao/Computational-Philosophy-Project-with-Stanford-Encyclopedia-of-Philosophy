    "main_text": "Early Action-Based Theories || Objections to Berkeley\u2019s Theory\n1.2 Objections to Berkeley\u2019s Theory\n\nCritics of Berkeley\u2019s theory in the 18th and\n19th centuries (for reviews, see Bain 1868; Smith 2000;\nAtherton 2005) principally targeted three claims:\n\n(a)\nthat \u201cdistance, of it self and immediately, cannot be\nseen\u201d (Berkeley 1709: \u00a71);\n(b)\nthat sight depends on learned connections with experiences of\nmovement and touch for its outward, spatial significance; and\n(c)\nthat \u201chabitual connexion\u201d, i.e., association, would by\nitself enable touch to \u201ceducate\u201d vision in the manner\nrequired by (b).\n\n\nMost philosophers and perceptual psychologists now concur with\nArmstrong\u2019s (1960) assessment that the \u201csingle\npoint\u201d argument for claim (a)\u2014\u201cdistance being a line\ndirected end-wise to the eye, it projects only one point in the fund\nof the eye, which point remains invariably the same, whether the\ndistance be longer or shorter\u201d (Berkeley 1709:\n\u00a72)\u2014conflates spatial properties of the retinal image with\nthose of the objects of sight (also see Condillac 1746/2001: 102;\nAbbott 1864: chap. 1). In contrast with claim (a), we should note,\nboth contemporary \u201cecological\u201d and information-processing\napproaches in vision science assume that the spatial representational\ncontents of visual experience are robustly three-dimensional: vision\nis no less a distance sense than touch.\n\nThree sorts of objections targeted on claim (b) were prominent. First,\nit is not evident to introspection that visual experiences reliably\nelicit tactile and kinaesthetic images as Berkeley suggests. As Bain\nsuccinctly formulates this objection:\n\n\nIn perceiving distance, we are not conscious of tactual feelings or\nlocomotive reminiscences; what we see is a visible quality, and\nnothing more. (1868: 194)\n\n\nSecond, sight is often the refractory party when conflicts with touch\narise. Consider the experience of seeing a three-dimensional scene in\na painting: \u201cI know, without any doubt\u201d, writes\nCondillac,\n\n\nthat it is painted on a flat surface; I have touched it, and yet this\nknowledge, repeated experience, and all the judgments I can make do\nnot prevent me from seeing convex figures. Why does this appearance\npersist? (1746/2001: I, \u00a76, 3)\n\n\nLast, vision in many animals does not need tutoring by touch before it\nis able to guide spatially directed movement and action. Cases in\nwhich non-human neonates respond adaptively to the distal sources of\nvisual stimulation\n\n\nimply that external objects are seen to be so\u2026. They prove, at\nleast, the possibility that the opening of the eye may be at once\nfollowed by the perception of external objects as such, or, in other\nwords, by the perception or sensation of outness. (Bailey 1842: 30;\nfor replies, see Smith 1811: 385\u2013390)\n\n\nHere it would be in principle possible for a proponent of\nBerkeley\u2019s position to maintain that, at least for such animals,\nthe connection between visual ideas and ideas of touch is innate and\nnot learned (see Stewart 1829: 241\u2013243; Mill 1842:\n106\u2013110). While this would abandon Berkeley\u2019s empiricism\nand associationism, it would maintain the claim that vision provides\ndepth information only because its ideas are connected to tangible\nideas.\n\nRegarding claim (c), many critics denied that the supposed\n\u201chabitual connexion\u201d between vision and touch actually\nobtains. Suppose that the novice perceiver sees a remote tree at\ntime1 and walks in its direction until she makes contact\nwith it at time2. The problem is that the perceiver\u2019s\ninitial visual experience of the tree at time1 is not\ntemporally contiguous with the locomotion-based experience of the\ntree\u2019s distance completed at time2. Indeed, at\ntime2 the former experience no longer exists. \u201cThe\nassociation required\u201d, Abbott thus writes,\n\n\ncannot take place, for the simple reason that the ideas to be\nassociated cannot co-exist. We cannot at one and the same moment be\nlooking at an object five, ten, fifty yards off, and be achieving our\nlast step towards it. (1864: 24)\n\n\nFinally, findings from perceptual psychology have more recently been\nleveled against the view that vision is educated by touch. Numerous\nstudies of how subjects respond to lens-, mirror-, and prism-induced\ndistortions of visual experience (Gibson 1933; Harris 1965, 1980; Hay\net al. 1965; Rock & Harris 1967) indicate that not only\nis sight resistant to correction from touch, it will often dominate or\n\u201ccapture\u201d the latter when intermodal conflicts arise. This\npoint will be discussed in greater depth in\n Section 3\n below.\n",
