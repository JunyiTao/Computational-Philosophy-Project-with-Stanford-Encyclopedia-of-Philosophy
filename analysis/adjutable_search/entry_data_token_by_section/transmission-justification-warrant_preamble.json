    "main_text": "\n\nTed is on his way to the Philosophy Department, early in the freezing\nmorning. Although he doesn\u2019t know how cold it is, Ted\nconjectures that the temperature must be below 0\u00b0C. Out of\ncuriosity, he checks the weather app of his smartphone. To his\nastonishment, he sees it is \u221230\u00b0C. He concludes that this is\nthe least temperature to which he has been exposed ever. Ted\u2019s\nbelief about his personal record owes its justification to Ted\u2019s\nbelief that it is \u221230\u00b0C, justified by the evidence supplied\nby his smartphone, and Ted\u2019s acknowledging that if it is\n\u221230\u00b0C, then this is the least temperature to which he has\nbeen exposed ever. When one\u2019s belief that \\(q\\) derives its\njustification from the justification that one has for another belief\nthat \\(p\\) in this way, it has become customary to say that the\njustification for \\(p\\) transmits to \\(q\\) across the\ninferential link from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\).\n\nTransmission of justification across inference is a valuable and\nubiquitous epistemic phenomenon in everyday life and science. Thanks\nto epistemic transmission, inferential reasoning can substantiate\npredictions of future events and, more generally, can expand the\nsphere of our justified beliefs or reinforce the justification of\nbeliefs we already entertain. However, transmission of justification\nis not without exceptions. As some epistemologists have come to\nrealize, more or less trivial forms of circularity can prevent\njustification from transmitting from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\) even if one has\njustification for \\(p\\) and one is aware of the inferential link from\n\\(p\\) to \\(q\\). In interesting cases this happens because one can\nacquire justification for \\(p\\) only if one has independent\njustification for \\(q\\). In this case the justification for \\(q\\)\ncannot depend on the justification for \\(p\\) and the inferential link\nfrom \\(p\\) to \\(q\\), as genuine transmission would require.\n\nThe phenomenon of transmission failure seems to shed light on\nphilosophical puzzles, such as Moore\u2019s proof of a material world\nand McKinsey\u2019s paradox, and it plays a central role in various\nphilosophical debates. For this reason it is granted continued and\nincreasing attention.\n",
