Collective Acceptance Theory of Institutions\n\nCollective acceptance accounts and, for that matter teleological\naccounts, of social action in general, and of social institutions in\nparticular, fall within the rationalist, individualist, philosophy of\naction tradition that has its roots in Aristotle, Hume and Kant and is\nassociated with contemporary analytic philosophers of social action\nsuch as Michael Bratman (1987), John Searle (1995), and Raimo Tuomela\n(2002). However, this way of proceeding also has a place outside\nphilosophy, in sociological theory. Broadly speaking, it is the\nstarting point for the voluntaristic theory of social action\nassociated with the likes of Georg Simmel (1971), Max Weber (1949),\n(the early) Talcott Parsons (1968) and Alfred Schutz (Schutz\nand Parsons 1978). For example, the following idea in relation to\nsocial action is expressed by Parsons (1968: 229): \n\nactions do not take place separately each with a separate, discrete\nend in relation to the situation, but in long complicated\n\u2018chains\u2019 \u2026 [and] the total complex of means-end\nrelationships is not to be thought of as similar to a large number of\nparallel threads, but as a complicated web (if not a tangle).\n\n\nHowever, unsurprisingly, the teleological account lays much greater\nexplanatory emphasis on the means-end relationship in collective\naction contexts and much less on collective acceptance. \n\nThat said, the starting point for both kinds of theory has been the\nnotion of a joint action and its constitutive conative notions (or,at\nleast, terminology) of shared intentions (Bratman 2014), we-intentions\n(Tuomela 2013), collective intentions (Searle 1990), collective ends\n(Miller 2001: Chapter 2), depending on which theorist is in question.\nExamples of joint action are two people lifting a table together, and\ntwo men jointly pushing a car. However, such basic two person joint\nactions exist at one end of a spectrum. At the other end are much more\ncomplex, multi-person, joint actions, such as a large group of\nengineers, tradesmen and construction workers jointly building a\nskyscraper or the members of an army jointly fighting a battle.\n\nOver the last several decades a number of analyses of joint action\nhave emerged (Gilbert 1989; Miller 2001: Chapter 2; Searle 1990 and\n1995; Tuomela 2002; Schmid 2009; Ludwig 2016). A number of these\ntheorists have developed and applied their favoured basic accounts of\njoint action in order to account for a range of social phenomena,\nincluding conventions, social norms and social institutions.\n\nIndividualism (of which more below) is committed to an analysis of\njoint action such that ultimately a joint action consists of: (1) a\nnumber of singular actions; and (2) relations among these singular\nactions. Moreover, the constitutive conative attitudes involved in\njoint actions are individual attitudes; there are no sui generis\nwe-attitudes.\n\nBy contrast, according to supra-individualists (Gilbert 1989), when a\nplurality of individual agents perform a joint action, then the agents\nhave the relevant propositional attitudes (beliefs, intentions etc.)\nin an irreducible \u2018we-form\u2019, which is sui generis (Searle\n1990) and as such not analysable in terms of individual or I-attitudes\nTuomela 2013). Moreover, the individual agents constitute a new\nentity, a supra-individual entity not reducible to the individual\nagents and the relations among them (Epstein 2015).\n\nIf the starting point for theorists in this strand of contemporary\nphilosophy of action is joint action (and its associated collective\nintentionality), it is by no means the endpoint. Specifically, there\nis the important matter of the relationship between joint action and\nsocial institutions. For example, while joint actions per se do not\nseem to necessarily involve rights, duties and other deontic\nproperties (see Gilbert 1989 for a contrary view), it is self-evident\nthat social institutions do so. Theorists within this recent tradition\nagree that joint actions\u2014or perhaps the collective\nintentionality definitive of joint actions\u2014is at least one of\nthe building blocks of social institutions. However, the question\nremains as to the precise relationship between joint actions (and its\nassociated collective intentionality) on the one hand, and social\ninstitutions on the other. More specifically, there is the question of\nhow, or if, we-intentions can generate deontic properties, such as the\ninstitutional rights and duties definitive of institutional roles.\n\n\nAccording to collective acceptance accounts (Searle 1995 and 2010;\nTuomela 2002; Ludwig 2017), social institutions are created and\nmaintained by collective acceptance. Collective acceptance accounts\nare constructivist; institutional facts and, therefore, institutions\nexist only in so far as they are collectively believed to exist or are\notherwise the content of a collective attitude, such as a\nwe-intention. Typically, such collective attitudes are not to be\nunderstood as reducible to individual attitudes or aggregates thereof.\n(Ludwig is an exception among collective acceptance adherents.\nAccording to him the so-called we-intentions constitutive of\ncollective acceptance (Ludwig 2017: 132) are analysable in terms of\ninterlocking individual intentions to achieve some outcome by means of\na shared plan (Ludwig 2017: 26)). Thus Searle claims his notion of a\ncollective intention or we-intention is a primitive notion that is not\nreducible to an individual intention, nor to an individual intention\nin conjunction with other individual attitudes such as individual\nbeliefs (Searle 1995: 24\u20136; Searle 2010: Chapter 3). Searle\u2019s\ninvocation of an unanalysed allegedly primitive notion is\ncontroversial in the context of reductive accounts (Miller 2001;\nBratman 2014; Ludwig 2016). On the other hand, Tuomela provides a\nnon-reductive analysis of we-intentions. He makes a distinction\nbetween irreducibly collective we-mode attitudes and individualistic\npro-group I-mode attitudes (Tuomela 2013: 6\u20137) and does so on the\ngrounds that the former involve the intention to act together as a\ngroup. However, Tuomela is open to the objection that the notion of\nacting qua member of a group can itself be analysed as acting in\naccording with an individual end which each agent has interdependently\nwith the others (a shared interdependent end) (Miller 2010: 52\u201354).\n\n\nCollective acceptance is not simply a matter of psychological\nattitudes standing in some straightforward causal relation to the\nexternal world as is the case, for instance, with common or\ngarden-variety intentions, including the joint intentions definitive\nof basic joint actions. The idea is not that a group forms a joint\nintention to (say) push a boulder up a hill and, thereby, jointly\ncause the boulder to be relocated to the top of the hill. Rather the\nnotion of a performative is typically invoked (Austin 1962; Searle\n2010: 11).\n\nExamples of performatives are: \u2018I name this ship the Queen\nElizabeth\u2019\u2014as uttered when smashing the bottle against the\nstem; \u2018I give and bequeath my watch to my\nbrother\u2019\u2014as occurring in a will (Austin 1962: 5).\nPerformative are speech acts which bring about an outcome in the\nexternal world (e.g. that the name of the ship is the Queen Elizabeth\nor that my brother is the owner of what used to be my watch).\nSpecifically, performatives are sayings which are also doings. In\nSearle\u2019s terminology, merely saying something (\u2018I\ndo\u2019) counts as something else (becoming a wife). An important\nspecies of performatives are declarative speech acts (e.g. saying\n\u2018I declare war\u2019 in a certain context counts as going to\nwar). A key point about performatives appears to be that it is by\nvirtue of a convention that saying such and such in a given context\nbrings the outcome about (Miller 1984). Accordingly, the outcome\ndepends on collective acceptance (in the sense of compliance with the\nconvention) and, indeed, to this extent the outcome is in part\nconstituted by collective acceptance (in this sense). Searle himself\nspeaks of constitutive rules at this point; rules that have the form\n\u2018X counts as Y in context C\u2019 (Searle 2010: 95).\n\nAs mentioned above, Guala denies a central role to constitutive rules.\nAccording to Guala, (following Hindriks 2009), constitutive\nrules are essentially naming devices; they state the conditions of\napplication of theoretical terms used to refer to institutions. For\ninstance, a dollar note (X) counts as money (Y) if it is issued by the\nrelevant authority. Here the Y term simply names a pattern of activity\ngoverned by regulative rules, e.g. \u2018Use the note as a medium of\nexchange\u2019. Other theorists who have, in effect, reduced or\notherwise down-graded Searle\u2019s notion of constitutive rules in\nfavour of regulative rules, including systems of regulative rules are\nMiller (2001: 191) and, more recently, Ludwig (2017).\nAccording to Ludwig, constitutive rules are regulative rules such that\nintentionally following them constitutes the activity they govern\n(Ludwig 2017: 262).\n\nFavourite examples of collective acceptance theorists are money,\npolitical authorities, and, most importantly for our concerns here,\nso-called status roles. Thus Tuomela says (2007: 183):\n\u201c\u2018performative\u2019 collective acceptance must have been\nin place for squirrel pelt to become money.\u201d And Searle says\n(2010: 101): \u201cBut when we count pieces of paper of a\nparticular sort as twenty-dollar bills we are making them twenty\ndollar bills by Declaration. The Declaration makes something the case\nby counting it as, that, by declaring it to be, the case.\u201d The\nproblem with this view of money (in its role purely as a medium of\nexchange) is that Tuomela\u2019s invocation of performatives and\nSearle\u2019s invocation of declaratives seem unnecessary. The fact\nthat squirrel pelts, shells or bit of inked paper are used as mediums\nof exchange is sufficient for them to be money. For a squirrel pelt to\ncount as money or to be treated as money or to be collectively\naccepted as money is just for it to be used as a medium of exchange.\nThe notion of collective acceptance either collapses into regular,\ninterdependent, use or it is superfluous. Nor do such informal\nexchange systems necessarily generate deontic properties; if your\nsquirrel pelt is refused as a medium of exchange by someone then your\nexpectation (in the sense of belief with respect to the future) has\nbeen dashed, but no institutional right has been violated (given the\ninformal character of the arrangement). Of course it would add greatly\nto the stability of this arrangement if these pelts (or, more likely,\nbits of inked paper) were somehow authorised as an official medium of\nexchange, and if a (rule constituted) system of institutional rights\nand duties in relation to the exchange of these shells was introduced\nand enforced. However, such a deontological structure does not seem to\nbe a necessary feature of the system of exchange (Miller 2001: 182;\nGuala 2016: 40). Naturally, it could be replied to this that,\nnevertheless, institutional rights and duties, as opposed to the\nunderlying functionality of the arrangement, requires performatives\nand, specifically, declaratives. \n\nWhat of political authorities? Searle says (1995: 91\u20132):\n\u201cMore spectacular examples are provided by the collapse of the\nSoviet empire in the annus mirabilis, 1989.\u2026 It collapsed when\nthe system of status-functions was no longer accepted.\u201d However,\nsuch collapses of political systems seem to demonstrate a special\nfeature of institutional positions of authority rather than of\ninstitutional roles in general. Specifically, it is a necessary\ncondition of wielding authority that subordinates obey the commands of\ntheir superior. Presumably, they do so because they believe the person\nin question has a moral right to be obeyed and/or they fear sanctions\nif they do not obey (Miller 2001: 189).\n\nWhat of status roles, i.e. institutional roles, in general? These are\nthe most important for our purposes in this entry. According to Searle\n(see also Ludwig 2017: Chapter 8), institutions necessarily involve\nwhat he calls status-functions, and something has a\nstatus-function\u2014as opposed to a mere function\u2014if it has,\nor those who use it have, deontic properties (institutional rights and\nduties) and, therefore, deontic powers (Searle 2018). Thus an\northopaedic surgeon has a status-function, and therefore a set of\ndeontic powers, including rights to perform operations and charge\npeople for doing so, and duties not to perform operations he or she is\nnot accredited to perform, e.g. brain surgery. These status-functions,\nand therefore deontic powers, have been created by collectively\naccepted constitutive rules (constitutive rules, as we have seen, have\nfor Searle the general form \u2018X counts as Y in context C\u2019).\nImportantly, as we saw above, according to Searle, constitutive rules\ndo not regulate a pre-existing activity; rather the activity is\ncreated by, and consists in acting in accordance with, constitutive\n(and related regulative) rules. Accordingly, institutional roles are\nof the same general kind as pieces in a game of chess (to use one of\nSearle\u2019s favourite examples (Searle 2018: 305)) and, therefore,\nunlike driving a car (which, according to Searle, pre-exists the\nregulative rules that govern it (Searle 2018: 305)); institutional\nroles and their defining deontic properties, are institutional facts\ncreated by collectively accepted constitutive rules. \n\nThe first point to be made here is that contra Searle many\ninstitutional roles seem more akin to regularly driving a car than to\nchess pieces. The institutional role of surgeon is a case point. The\nability and activity definitive of a surgeon, i.e. cutting and\nstitching human bodies, is evidently logically prior to the\ninstitutional rights and duties that attach to the institutional role\nof a surgeon (Miller 2001: 186). More generally, a surgeon could\nseemingly carry out surgical operations on willing patients\nirrespective not only of whether she was professionally accredited\n(and, therefore, possessed of the requisite institutional rights and\nduties), but also of whether she was widely regarded as a surgeon in\nher community. Consider, for instance, a morally motivated, skilful,\nsurgeon whose full-time job is transplanting hearts in a jurisdiction\nin which organ transplantation is illegal.\n\nIf this is correct then the crucial issue that now arises concerns the\nrelationship between possession of the deontic properties, i.e.\ninstitutional rights and duties, at least in part constitutive of an\ninstitutional role, on the one hand, and the actual ability to\nundertake that role, bearing in mind that the activity is, at least in\nsome cases of institutional roles, logically prior to its\ninstitutional raiment. Specifically, are the institutional rights and\nduties in part definitive of institutional roles, such as that of a\nsurgeon, merely the creation of collectively accepted constitutive\nrules, irrespective of how collective acceptance and constitutive\nrules are understood (see, for instance, Ludwig (2017: Chapter\n8) for a view that derives from, but is somewhat different to,\nSearle\u2019s), or are they based on more than this? For instance,\nare institutional rights and duties in large part based on moral\nconsiderations, such as needs, e.g. the institutional right to perform\nheart transplants is based on the needs of patient for a new heart, as\nper the teleological account of social institutions (section 4 below)?\nOne response favoured by collective acceptance theorists, such as\nTuomela (2013: 126) and Ludwig (2017: 129\u2013130), is to\ninvoke the notion of an explicit or implicit agreement (and,\ntherefore, promise or quasi-promise) as in part constitutive of\ncollective acceptance (because either constitutive of we-intentions or\nof conventions). However, this reliance on the notion of an agreement\nultimately grounds deontic properties on a contractualist moral theory\nand, therefore, brings with it all the objections to such theories,\ne.g. that there typically no explicit agreements and a lack of\nevidence of many implicit agreements.\n3. The Teleological Account of Institutions\n\nAs noted above, the central concept in the teleological account of\nsocial institutions (Miller 2010) is that of joint action. On the\nteleological account, joint actions consist of the intentional\nindividual actions of a number of agents directed to the realisation\nof a collective end. (Note that intentions are not the same things as\nends, e.g. an agent who intentionally and gratuitously raises\nhis arm ex hypothesi has no end or purpose in doing so.)\nImportantly, on the teleological account, a collective\nend\u2014notwithstanding its name\u2014is a species of individual\nend; it is an end possessed by each of the individuals involved in the\njoint action. However it is an end, which is not realised by the\naction of any one of the individuals; the actions of all or most\nrealise the end. So contra anti-reductionist theorists such as\nGilbert, Tuomela and Searle, the teleological account holds that joint\nactions can be analysed in terms of individualist notions. A second\nmajor point of differentiation from collective acceptance accounts is\nthat on the teleological account conative notions, such as\nwe-intentions and, more relevantly, collective ends, cannot in and of\nthemselves generate deontic properties, specifically institutional\nrights and duties. Accordingly, the basis for deontic properties must\nlie elsewhere. As we shall see, on the teleological account, the basis\nfor deontological properties is to be found in large part in the\ncollective goods provided by institutions.\n\nCollective ends can be unconsciously pursued, and have not necessarily\nbeen at any time explicitly formulated in the minds of those pursuing\nthem; collective ends can be implicit in the behaviour and\nattitudes of agents without ceasing to be ends as such. Further, in\nthe case of a collective end pursued over a long period of time, e.g.\nby members of an institution over generations, the collective end can\nbe latent at a specific point in time, i.e. it is not\nactually being pursued, explicitly or implicitly, at that point in\ntime. However, it does not thereby cease to be an end of that\ninstitution\u2014which is to say, of those persons\u2014even at\nthose times when it is not being pursued.\n\nAs we saw above, organisations consist of an (embodied) formal\nstructure of interlocking roles. These roles can be defined\nin terms of tasks, regularities in action and the like. Moreover,\nunlike social groups, organisations are individuated by the kind of\nactivity which they undertake, and also by their characteristic\nends. So we have governments, universities, business\ncorporations, armies, and so on. Perhaps governments have as an end or\ngoal the ordering and leading of societies, universities the end of\ndiscovering and disseminating knowledge, and so on (Miller 2010: Part\nB). Here it is important to reiterate that these ends are, firstly,\ncollective ends and, secondly, often the latent and/or implicit\n(collective) ends of individual institutional actors.\n\nOn the teleological account, a further defining feature of\norganisations is that organisational action typically consists in,\nwhat has elsewhere been termed, a layered structure of joint\nactions. One illustration of the notion of a layered structure of\njoint actions is an armed force fighting a battle. Suppose at an\norganisation level a number of \u201cactions\u201d are severally\nnecessary and jointly sufficient to achieve some collective end. Thus\nthe \u201cactions\u201d of the mortar squad destroying enemy gun\nemplacements, the flight of military planes providing air-cover and\nthe infantry platoon taking and holding the ground might be severally\nnecessary and jointly sufficient to achieve the collective end of\ndefeating the enemy; as such these \u201cactions\u201d constitute a\njoint action. Call each of these \u201cactions\u201d level-two\nactions. Suppose, in addition, that each of these level-two\n\u201cactions\u201d is itself\u2014at least in part\u2014a joint\naction whose component actions are severally necessary and jointly\nsufficient for the performance of the level-two \u201caction\u201d\nin question. Call these component actions, level-one actions. So the\ncollective end of the level-one actions is the performance of the\nlevel-two \u201caction\u201d. Thus the individual members of the\nmortar squad jointly operate the mortar in order to realise the\ncollective end of destroying enemy gun emplacements. Each pilot,\njointly with the other pilots, strafes enemy soldiers in order to\nrealise the collective end of providing air-cover for their advancing\nfoot soldiers. Finally, the set of foot soldiers jointly advance in\norder to take and hold the ground vacated by the members of the\nretreating enemy force. The actions of each of the individual foot\nsoldiers, mortar squad members and individual pilots are level-one\nactions.\n\nOn the teleological account a further feature of many social\ninstitutions is their use of joint institutional mechanisms.\nExamples of joint institutional mechanisms are the device of tossing a\ncoin to resolve a dispute and voting to elect a candidate to political\noffice.\n\nJoint institutional mechanisms consist of: (a) a complex of\ndifferentiated but interlocking actions (the input to the mechanism);\n(b)the result of the performance of those actions (the output of the\nmechanism), and; (c) the mechanism itself. Thus a given agent might\nvote for a candidate. He will do so only if others also vote. But\nfurther to this, there is the action of the candidates, namely, that\nthey present themselves as candidates. That they present themselves as\ncandidates is (in part) constitutive of the input to the voting\nmechanism. Voters vote for candidates. So there is\ninterlocking and differentiated action (the input). Further there is\nsome result (as opposed to consequence) of the joint action; the joint\naction consisting of the actions of putting oneself forward as a\ncandidate and of the actions of voting. The result is that some\ncandidate, say, Barack Obama is voted in (the output). That there is a\nresult is (in part) constitutive of the mechanism. That to receive the\nmost number of votes is to be voted in, is (in part) constitutive of\nthe voting mechanism. Moreover that Obama is voted in is not a\ncollective end of all the voters. (Although it is a collective end of\nthose who voted for Obama.) However, that the one who gets the most\nvotes\u2014whoever that happens to be\u2014is voted in is a\ncollective end of all the voters, including those who voted for some\ncandidate other than Obama. \n\nIf the end realised in joint action, and organisational action in\nparticular, is not merely a collective end, but also a collective\ngood, then moral properties may well be generated. In the first place,\nthe collective good might consist in an aggregate of basic human needs\nthat have been met, as in the case of food producers, schools,\nhospitals and police organisations. But, arguably, such needs generate\nmoral obligations; other things being equal, the desperately poor (for\nexample) morally ought to be assisted by the ongoing, organised joint\naction of those able to assist.\n\nIn the second place\u2014at the, so to speak, production, as opposed\nto the consumption, end of joint action\u2014the realisation of\ncollective ends that are also collective goods may well generate joint\nmoral rights. It is easy to see why some agents, and not other agents,\nwould have a right to such a good; they are the ones responsible for\nits existence, or continued existence. In this connection consider the\nmanagers and workers in a factory that produces cars which are sold\nfor profit. Managers and workers in the factory\u2014but not\nnecessarily others\u2014have a joint moral right to be remunerated\nfrom the sales of the cars that they jointly produced\u2014and not\nsimply on the basis of some contractual arrangement that they have\nentered into. It is also clear that if one participating agent has a\nmoral right to the good, then\u2014other things being equal\u2014so\ndo the others. That is, there is interdependence of moral rights with\nrespect to the good. Moreover, these moral rights generate correlative\nmoral duties on the part of others to respect these rights. Naturally\nthese prior joint right and duties can be, and are, institutionalised\nincluding by way of contract based legal rights and duties that to\nsome extent respect the relative contributions made by the\nparticipants. \n\nUnlike the collective acceptance account the teleological account\nintroduces moral deontology at the ground floor (so to speak) and\ntries to generate institutional deontology on the back of this prior\nmoral deontology, e.g. institutional moral rights are\ninter-subjectively believed moral rights. As such it is open to the\ncharge that moral deontology presupposes institutional forms. The\nconcept of a right, for example, might be held to make no sense\noutside an institutional environment. Indeed, Searle (2010:\nChapter 8) offers this kind of argument, including in relation to\nhuman rights (Burman 2018). Another objection is that many members of\norganisations do not have the collective ends of the institution of\nwhich they are members as an end; rather they perform their roles\nbecause they are paid to do so. However, joint actions can be\nperformed for individual ends; there can be quasi-joint actions\n(Miller 2001: 180)\n\nIn this section the teleological account of social institutions has\nbeen elaborated. In the following section issues of institutions and\nagency are discussed.\n4. Institutions and Agency\n\nAs mentioned above, it is convenient to conceive of social\ninstitutions as possessed of three dimensions, namely, structure,\nfunction and culture. While the structure, function and culture of an\ninstitution provide a framework within which individuals act, they do\nnot fully determine the actions of individuals. There are a number of\nreasons why this is so. For one thing, rules, norms and ends cannot\ncover every contingency that might arise; for another, rules, norms\nand so on, themselves need to be interpreted and applied. Moreover,\nchanging circumstances and unforeseeable problems make it desirable to\nvest institutional role occupants (individually or jointly) with\ndiscretionary powers to rethink and adjust old rules, norms, and ends,\nand sometimes elaborate new ones (Warwick 1981)\n\nLegitimate individual or collective discretionary activity undertaken\nwithin an institution is typically facilitated by a rational internal\nstructure\u2014including role structure\u2014, and by a rational\ninstitutional culture. By rational, it is here meant internally\nconsistent, as well as rational in the light of the\ninstitution\u2019s purposes. For instance, a hierarchical role\nstructure might be rational in one institution, e.g. a defence force,\nbut not another, e.g. a university. Again, a culture of greed might\nundermine an institution\u2019s purposes, e.g. in a financial\ninstitution.\n\nAside from the internal dimensions of an institution, there are its\nexternal relationships, including its relationships to other\ninstitutions. In particular, there is the extent of the independence\nof an institution from other institutions, including government. One\nthinks here of the separation of powers among the legislative,\nexecutive and judicial institutions in the United States of America\nand elsewhere.\n\nIt should be noted that, strictly speaking, independence is not the\nsame thing as autonomy, but is rather a necessary condition for it. An\ninstitution possessed of independence from other institutions might\nnevertheless lack autonomy, if it lacked the kinds of rational\ninternal structure and culture noted above. Indeed, internal conflicts\ncan paralyse an institution to the point where it becomes incapable of\npursuing its institutional purposes, e.g. a bitterly divided\nlegislature.\n\nGranted that institutional actors have a degree of discretionary\npower, nevertheless, they are constrained by institutional structure,\nand specifically the role structure, of the role that they occupy. As\nis often pointed out, institutional structure also enables the action\nof institutional actors (Giddens 1984). Police officers, for example,\nhave significant powers not possessed by ordinary citizens. \n\nA much-discussed issue in the philosophical literature that arises at\nthis point concerns the alleged agency of of institutions;\nspecifically, the view that institutions (and other collective\nentities) per se are agents. As mentioned, advocates of this view in\none form or another, include French (1984), Gilbert (1989), List and\nPettit (2011), Tollefsen (2015) and Epstein (2015).\n\nList and Pettit provide an argument based on judgement aggregation in\nsupport of their view and suggest, further, that the actions of\ncollective entities supervene on those of their members. The judgement\naggregation paradox (see also Copp 2007), are supposed to demonstrate\nthe existence of processes of irreducibly collective reasoning from\nwhich irreducibly collective intentions and judgements\u2014and,\nultimately, group minds\u2014are inferred. (See Szigeti 2013) for\ncounter-arguments to List and Pettit). A key question is whether the\nexamples provided by Copp, by List and Pettit and by others can be\naccommodated by an analysis which does not help itself to irreducibly\nprocesses of collective reasoning, e.g. the notion of joint\n(epistemic) institutional mechanisms (Miller 2018) mentioned in\nsection 3. Consider the well-known tenure committee example (Copp\n2007).\n\nThe tenure committee consists of three members and the criteria for\nassessment are excellence in teaching, research and administration.\nEach of the members of the committee believes the candidate is\nexcellent in only two of the areas. However, the committee can reach\nits conclusion to deny or confirm tenure on the basis of a\nconclusion-driven procedure or a premise-driven procedure. If the\nconclusion-driven procedure is used tenure will be denied since on\nthis procedure each votes to confirm tenure only if he or she judges\nthe candidate to be excellent in all three areas. If the\npremise-driven procedure is used tenure will be confirmed. For on this\nprocedure each votes on each criterion and if a majority judge the\ncandidate to be excellent on that criterion the candidate is deemed to\nbe excellent on that criterion. Since with respect to each of the\ncriteria a majority vote that the candidate is excellent, the result\nis that the candidate is deemed to be excellent in all three areas.\nThe adherents of irreducibly collectivist reasoning claim that that\nthe choice between the premise-driven way and the conclusion-driven\nway is a choice between submitting to individual reason and submitting\nto collective reason. However, both procedures involve a voting\nprocedure and to that extent involve a joint institutional mechanism\nanalysable in wholly individualist terms (as per section 3 above). In\naddition, both procedures involve a process of reasoning from premises\nto a conclusion; however, this process is one of logic, and in the\ntenure example it is a process carried out in the heads of the members\nof the tenure committee. In the premise-driven procedure the premises\nfrom which each committee member will individually infer the\nconclusion that the candidate is excellent in all three areas are\ndetermined by voting, whereas in the case of the conclusion-driven\nprocedure the conclusion that the candidate is not excellent in all\nthree areas is inferred from premises that have been individually\nchosen. Accordingly, there is no process of collective reasoning as\nsuch in the use of either procedure.\n\nSupposing institutions, in particular, are collective agents there\nremains the question of the relationship between these collective\nagents and their human members. The favoured relationship, e.g. by\nList and Pettit, is that of supervenience. Epstein has provided\ndetailed arguments against the supervenience thesis. He distinguishes\nbetween what he refers as the grounding and the anchoring of social\nphenomena, including institutions and institutional objects, and\nutilizes H. L. A. Hart\u2019s distinction between primary rules and\nsecondary rule in doing so (Hart 1961). Roughly speaking, primary\nrules directly govern the behaviour of citizens, e.g. laws against\nmurder. Secondary rules determine what the primary rules are, e.g. the\nlegislative processes for enacting primary rules. According to\nEpstein, the grounds of a primary rule against murder consist of facts\nsuch as intentional killing, whereas secondary rules, e.g. the\nlegislative enactment process, would anchor the primary rule. Let us\nnow see how this grounding/anchoring distinction works by way of the\nexample of the Supreme Court of the US. According to Epstein (2015:\n223), the fact that the Supreme Court issues a particular opinion is\ngrounded in facts such as that its members voted in particular\nways. Moreover, their powers, e.g. to vote, are anchored in part by\nthe US Constitution and the Judiciary Acts (which established the US\ncourts). However, says Epstein, some grounding facts are external to\nfacts about the members of the institution in question, e.g. external\nto facts about the justices of the Supreme Court.  Therefore, the\nactions of a group depend on more than the actions of the members of\nthe group. For instance, the issuance of an opinion by the Supreme\nCourt depends on more than the votes and other actions of the justices\nof the Supreme Court, it also depends on the constraints on their\nactions (Epstein 2015: 227), e.g. constraints imposed by,\ni.e. anchored in, the US Constitution and the Judicial Acts. Epstein\ntakes this dependence of the actions of the Supreme Court on external\nfacts, and specifically the actions of persons other than the members\nof the Supreme Court, to undermine the supervenience claim. This is\nplausible. However, since the argument at this point simply assumes\nthat the Supreme Court per se performs actions, it does not\ndemonstrate that the actions of the Supreme Court are not simply the\nactions of the members of the Supreme Court. For if we assume contra\nEpstein that the Supreme Court per se is not an agent and does not\nperform actions, then his argument merely demonstrates what is clearly\ncorrect, namely, that the actions of the members of the Supreme Court\nare to some extent dependent on the actions of persons other than the\nmembers of the Supreme Court, e.g. the framers of the US Constitution\nand of the Judicial Acts. Indeed, arguably, it is the view that\ninstitutions per se are agents that is the root of the problem and the\ndifficulties identified by Epstein that arise from positing the\nsupervenience relation merely symptoms. For if institutions are not\nagents per se and, therefore, do not perform actions and are not\npossessed of mental states, then there is no need to posit this\nsupervenience relation. \n\nAnother important issue in relation to agency concerns the nature of\nthe relationship between institutional structure and the agency of\ninstitutional actors (Pleasants 2019). More specifically, a question\narises as to whether or not one of these is logically prior to the\nother (or whether neither is). Thus some theorists, e.g. Emile\nDurkheim (1964) are held to conceive of structure as sui\ngeneris in relation to individual agency; and indeed, at least in the\ncase of structuralists such as Althusser (1971), explanatory\nof human \u2018agency\u2019. The proposition of structuralists such\nas Althusser is that institutional structures (in the sense of a\nstructure of social roles and social norms) are a basic, non-reducible\nfeature of the world and the actions, values, self-images and the like\nof individual human agents must conform to these structures because\nindividual agency, properly understood, is in fact constituted by such\nstructures. An individual human agent is simply the repository of the\nroles and values of the institutions in which the \u2018agent\u2019\nlives his or her life. Other theorists, e.g., arguably Max Weber\n(1949) and methodological individualists, conceive of\ninstitutional structure as simply an abstraction from the habitual and\ninterdependent actions of individual human beings actors. Social\nreality is wholly compromised of individual human agents and their\nongoing, patterned interactions; there is no structure as such.\n(Theorists such as Durkheim occupy a mid-position in which there is\nboth sui generis structure and non-reducible agency; such theorists\nnow confront the problem of conflict between structure and individual\nagency\u2014which overrides which?) \n\nIn relation to this issue Anthony Giddens (1976 and 1984) has\nattempted to reconcile the felt reality of individual agency with the\napparent need to posit some form of institutional structure that\ntranscends individual agency.\n\nAccording to Giddens, structure is both constituted by human agency\nand is the medium in which human action takes place (Giddens 1976, p.\n121). This seems to mean, firstly, that structure is nothing other\nthan the repetition over time of the related actions of many\ninstitutional actors. So the structure consists of: (i) the habitual\nactions of each institutional agent; (ii) the set of such agents; and\n(iii) the relationship of interdependence between the actions of any\none agent and the actions of the other agents. But it means, secondly,\nthat this repetition over time of the related actions of many agents\nprovides not just the context, but the framework, within which the\naction of a single agent at a particular spatio-temporal point is\nperformed. Structure qua framework constrains any given\nagent\u2019s action at a particular spatio-temporal point. (In\naddition, and as Giddens is at pains to point out, structure qua\nframework enables various actions not otherwise possible,\ne.g. linguistic structure enables speech acts to be performed.)\n\nThis seems plausible as far as it goes; however, we are owed an\naccount of the interdependence among the actions of different\nagents. On a teleological account of institutions this interdependence\nis in large part generated by the ends of the institutions.\n\n\nHere we need to remind ourselves of a characteristic feature of\ninstitutions, namely, their reproductive capacity. Institutions\nreproduce themselves, or at least are disposed to do so. On the\nteleological account of institutions, this is in large part because\nthe members of institutions strongly identify with the institutional\nends and social norms that are definitive of those institutions, and\ntherefore make relatively long term commitments to institutions and\ninduct others into those institutions.\n\nHowever, it has been suggested by, for example, Roy Bhaskar (1979: 44)\nthat this reproduction of institutions is the unintended result of the\nfree actions of institutional actors in institutional settings. (See\nalso Merton 1968: Part 1 Section 3.) By way of support for this\nproposition Bhaskar claims that people do not marry to reproduce the\nnuclear family or work to reproduce the capitalist system. \n\nThe first point to be made by way of response to Bhaskar is that even\nif the reproduction of an institution was an unintended\nconsequence of the intentional participation of agents in that\ninstitution it would not follow that those agents did not have various\nother institutional outcomes as an end. For example, members of a\nbusiness might have the maximisation of profit as an explicit\ncollective end, even if the reproduction of the company was not\nintended by anyone. \n\nThe second point is that having an outcome as an implicit\nand/or latent collective end is not equivalent to\nindividually explicitly intending to bring about that outcome. But it\nis the former, and not the latter that is in question. What is the\nevidence for the former in relation to Bhaskar\u2019s chosen\nexamples?\n\nConsider a market-based institution, such as a company. Assume that\nthe owners and managers of this company work to maintain the existence\nof their company and\u2014through training, recruitment and so\non\u2014to ensure that it continues beyond their retirement or\nresignation. Moreover, assume that in their ongoing interaction with\ncustomers and with other businesses, they knowingly\u2014and in the\ncase of sales and marketing personnel, intentionally\u2014establish\nand maintain specific economic relationships. More generally\u2014let\nus assume\u2014they express, often explicitly, not only their\ncommitment to their own business, but to the market system in general.\nFurther, let us assume that where appropriate and possible, they\nassist in the maintenance and further development of that system, e.g.\nby voting for a market oriented political party. Now consider a set of\nsuch companies. Arguably\u2014given these fairly plausible\nassumptions\u2014each of owner and manager of any of these companies\nhas\u2014jointly with the others\u2014an implicit and (much of the\ntime) latent collective end to reproduce the market system.\n\nFurther, there are institutions, such as schools and churches, and\npolicymaking bodies, such as governments, that are explicitly\nengaged in the enterprise of reproducing a variety of social\ninstitutions other than themselves. They contribute to the\nreproduction of various social institutions by propagating the\n\u201cideology\u201d of these institutions, but also by advocating\nand, in the case of government, by implementing specific policies to\nensure the reproduction of these institutions.\n\nDoubtless, unintended consequences\u2014or, more precisely,\nconsequences not aimed at as an end\u2014have an important role in\nthe life and for that matter, the death, of institutions (Hirschman\n1970). Such consequences might include ones produced by evolutionary\nstyle causal mechanisms, or ones involved in so-called \u201chidden\nhand\u201d mechanisms. (Albeit, as we saw above, \u201chidden\nhand\u201d mechanisms are often the product of deliberate\ninstitutional design, and so their consequences are in a general sense\naimed at by the designers, if not by the participating institutional\nactors themselves.)\n\nMore specifically, habitual action is a necessary feature of\nindividual and collective\u2014including institutional\u2014life;\nand each single action performed on the basis of a habit, contributes\nin turn, and often unintentionally, to the maintenance and\nreinforcement of that habit. So the fact that institutional actors\nnecessarily act in large part on the basis of habit means that many of\ntheir actions unintentionally contribute to the reproduction of the\ninstitution. However, this is consistent with a teleological account\nof social institutions\u2014since, as noted above, there are outcomes\nother than institutional reproduction, and many of these are outcomes\nthat are clearly aimed at. Moreover, it is consistent even with a\nteleological explanation of the reproduction of social institutions,\nsince the establishment and periodic justificatory review of\nhabits are themselves susceptible to teleological explanation.",
