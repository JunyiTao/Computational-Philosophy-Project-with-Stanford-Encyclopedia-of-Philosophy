    "main_text": "Formulating Dignity || Dignity\u2019s defining properties vs. dignity\u2019s grounds\n2.1 Dignity\u2019s defining properties vs. dignity\u2019s grounds\n\nThe previous section offered examples of how the general schema of\ndignity\u2019s meaning gets modified in existing theory, as well as\nhow each category of meaning might be fleshed out. More examples could\nbe given. But to decide between any of them, it seems crucial to ask,\nhow should we formulate the concept of dignity? In other\nwords, instead of simply cataloging first-order views about its\nmeaning, we need to introduce some second-order criteria.\n\nOn the one hand, we need to determine the defining properties\nof dignity: the distinguishing characteristics or explanatory demands\nthat are supposed to apply to any contentful account of dignity. Such\ncriteria might include, for example, that dignity is\n\u201cinherent\u201d; that it is \u201cincommensurable\u201d with\nother values; that it has a \u201cdistinctive normative\nfunction\u201d; that it has an essential connection to rights; and so\non.\n\nOn the other hand, we need to determine what grounds dignity:\nwe need to say what it is about humans, or any being with dignity,\nthat satisfies the defining properties. In other words, we need to\nanswer the question: In virtue of what do we have dignity? The most\ncommon answer to this question, historically speaking, especially when\nit comes to human dignity, involves a claim about autonomy. Or if not\nautonomy tout court, then the \u201ccapabilities\u201d for such\nautonomy (see, e.g., Nussbaum 1995, 2006a, and 2006b). Thus, one\nfinds many variations of the claim that humans have dignity in virtue\nof their capacity for (or exercise of) \u201cchoice\u201d or\n\u201crational agency\u201d\u2014claims that are often tethered to\nthe earlier discussed historical platitude about Kant. This said,\nalternatives to the grounding question about human dignity include\nbrute species membership, sentience, the creative power of humanity,\ncreation \u201cin the image of God\u201d, a politically conferred\nstatus as \u201crights bearer\u201d, the capacity for empathy and\ncaring relationships, the earlier mentioned \u201cpersonality\u201d,\nthe concrete \u201cparticularity\u201d of an individual person, and\nthe possession of \u201cperspective\u201d.\n\nSorting these views is not easy for a few reasons. First, some of the\noperative concepts, such as \u201cautonomy\u201d, are themselves\nhotly disputed. Second, there is no pre-theoretical reason to deny\nmultiple ways of satisfying any given definitional criteria. That is,\nany given proposal for the defining properties of dignity might be\nsatisfied by more than one ground. For example, depending on the\ncriteria, humans might \u201chave\u201d dignity in virtue of both\nautonomy and sentience, or both divine creation and\nour capacity for empathy, and so on. Third, twentieth century\ntheorists rarely took a second-order view on their subject and\nmethods. In turn, they often confused or at least failed to clarify\nwhich of the two foregoing challenges they were trying to tackle,\narticulating dignity\u2019s defining properties or articulating\ndignity\u2019s grounds.\n\nThankfully, twenty-first century formulations of dignity are marked by\nincreasingly conscientious attempts to articulate the defining\nproperties of dignity, and to do so in a way that might guide\ndiscussion about dignity\u2019s grounds. For example, in\n\u201cBedrock Truths and the Dignity of the Individual\u201d,\nIglesias (2001) distinguishes between historically older,\n\u201crestricted\u201d meanings of dignity associated with general\nschema\n (1),\n (2), and\n (3);\n and, on the other hand, what she calls \u201cuniversal\u201d\nmeanings associated with schema\n (4),\n \u201chuman dignity\u201d. She further argues that any satisfactory\nuniversalist account must render human dignity as \n (4a) \n in some sense \u201cinherent\u201d or \u201cintrinsic\u201d; and \n (4b) \n the \u201cgrounds\u201d of basic rights. Regarding the latter, Iglesias\nwrites:\n\n\nThe connection is essential. It is rooted in the concept of the human\nperson, in human self-understanding as constituted by the bedrock\ntruths about what and who we are\u2026The universal meaning of the\nconcept of dignity, as inherent to every human being,\nexpresses the intrinsic good that the human being is. The\ndistinct human rights articulate those basic intrinsic\ngoods proper to, and expressive of, each one\u2019s dignity,\nindividually and in community relationships\u2014as dimensions of our\nvery being. These basic goods\u2014guaranteed as rights\u2014must be\nrecognized, respected, and promoted so that the intrinsic good that\nthe human being is himself or herself, personally and as an\nindividual, may be preserved and assured. Thus, the ground for\nadvocacy and defense of human rights resides on what and who the human\nbeing is, as a human being, namely on his or her dignity.\n(2001: 130)\n\n\nBy comparison, Shultziner (2007) adopts a\n\u201cphilosophical-linguistic\u201d method to distinguish\nmoral-philosophical uses of dignity from political and legal\n\u201cfunctions\u201d of the concept, especially the use of dignity\nto ground specific rights and enforceable duties. Regarding the\nlatter, Shultziner stresses that in real world contexts, the rights\nwhich the concept of dignity is used to ground vary considerably:\n\n\nThere is no fixed and universal content that spouts out of human\ndignity and, hence, its content and meanings are determined separately\nin each legal document in accordance with the political agreement\nachieved at the time. (2007: 78)\n\n\nThis might seem to express skepticism about the possibility of any\ngeneral, stable concept of dignity. In fact, it underlines the point\nof Iglesias\u2019s final criterion\n (4b);\n namely, that a defining property of dignity is the grounding\nconnection to rights. In other words, strictly speaking, Shultziner\nagrees with Iglesias that at least one defining property of\nhuman dignity\u2014in political contexts\u2014is that dignity\ngrounds rights, even though the content of these rights vary greatly\nbecause the grounds of dignity itself vary greatly.\n [4]\n\nAnother example of second-order thinking can be found in Debes (2009),\nwho argues that any satisfactory \u201cformal\u201d account of human\ndignity\u2014by which he means an account of its defining\nproperties\u2014must pick out a \u201cdistinctive\u201d value or\nstatus belonging to humans. And it must be distinctive in the sense\nthat it (a) is not merit based, but instead unearned; (b) is in some\nsense \u201cincommensurable\u201d with other values; and (c) makes\nsense of the basic \u201cnormative function\u201d of the concept.\nRegarding (c), Debes argues that the concept of dignity does not\npurport to be only or even mainly descriptive. Instead, it has a\nnormative purpose or role, namely, \u201cto set off in our\npractical deliberations whatever \u2018dignity\u2019 is applied\nto\u2014to guard or protect what has dignity\u201d (2009:\n61\u20132).\n\nOr consider Waldron (2012), who tracks a confusion in legal\ndiscussions of dignity between (on the one hand) definitional claims\nabout dignity\u2019s defining properties and (on the other hand)\nclaims about dignity\u2019s practical conditions; that is, the\nconditions of its moral, social, or political recognition. Thus,\nWaldron notes the way that various human rights charters claim that\ndignity is \u201cinherent\u201d in the human person; but also\n\u201ccommand us to make heroic efforts to establish\neveryone\u2019s dignity\u201d (2012: 16, emphasis added). Such\nclaims, he writes, may look like an equivocation akin to claiming, as\nRousseau once did, that \u201cMan is born free but everywhere is in\nchains\u201d\u2014a claim that Jeremy Bentham later called\n\u201cmiserable nonsense\u201d. However, Waldron argues that Bentham\nmissed an easy explanation of Rousseau:\n\n\n[A person] might be identified as a free man in a juridical\nsense\u2014that is his legal status\u2014even though he is found in\nconditions of slavery\u2026So, similarly, one might say that every\nhuman person is free as a matter of status\u2014the status accorded\nto him by his creator\u2014even though it is the case that some\nhumans are actually in chains and need to have their freedom\nrepresented as the content of a normative demand. (2012:\n16\u201317)\n\n\nTo be clear, Waldron quickly adds that one might shy away from the\nspecific premise of divine creation as a way of grounding human\nfreedom. That metaphysical premise is only an example. His overarching\npoint is that it is not incoherent to make this kind of\nclaim. Because the operative claim about the status of human\npersons\u2014namely, that they are free\u2014is a claim about a\ndefining property of the concept of \u201cman\u201d (in a juridical\nsense), it follows that we can distinguish this claim from any further\nclaim about what grounds this \u201cfree\u201d status, as well any\nclaim about the worldly conditions that are required for this status\nto be expressed, realized, or recognized.\n\nKeeping this in mind, we can now understand why Waldron thinks that we\nare not necessarily equivocating if we claim that dignity is\ninherent, but nevertheless enjoin others to\nestablish it in practice. He writes,\n\n\nOn the one hand, the term [\u201cdignity\u201d] may be used to\nconvey something about the inherent rank or status of human beings; on\nthe other hand, it may be used concomitantly to convey the demand that\nrank or status should actually be recognized. (2012: 17)\n\n\nImportantly Waldron further argues that dignity finds its proper\nconceptual home not in morality, but in the legal context of rights.\nHe writes, \u201claw is its natural habitat\u201d (2012: 13). This\nis because, he argues, rights articulate, or flesh out, the kind of\nstatus that modern conceptions of dignity typically include or allude\nto; but also, which his own theory depends on. Thus, for Waldron, it\nis historically mistaken and theoretically confused to ground our\ncontemporary concept of human dignity on thick metaphysical\nbases\u2014some inviolable value that \u201cinheres\u201d in\nhumans, whether by dint of divine creation or otherwise. Instead, on\nWaldron\u2019s view, the contemporary notion of human dignity is\nessentially Samuel Johnson\u2019s old idea of \u201celevated\nrank\u201d, albeit refashioned in the modern consciousness\nto apply to all humans.\n\nIn other words, Waldron explains the historical revolution in our\nconcept of dignity as turning on a leveling up of all people\nto the kind of social status once reserved only for the noble elite.\nWe simply reappropriated the term \u201cdignity\u201d to describe\nthis high status, ditching its original \u201csortal\u201d\nconnotation for a new egalitarian one (2012: 57\u201361).\nFurthermore, he claims that all this happened through (or mainly\nthrough) the paradigm of rights. Oversimplifying for sake of argument:\nWaldron thinks that people of lower social rank successfully annexed\nthe rights reserved to those of higher ranks, by reinterpreting those\nrights as human rights. Hence why rights remain the critical\napparatus for fleshing out the kind of status relevant to\n\u201cdignity\u201d, and why the proper home of dignity is law, not\nmorality.\n\nWaldron\u2019s view on dignity has been influential, so a few more\nnotes about it are fitting. First, in making these claims about\ndignity-as-elevated-rank, Waldron partly aligns himself with Appiah\n(2010), although Waldron does not seem to notice this. Second,\nWaldron\u2019s claim about the \u201chome\u201d of dignity is\ncontentious. It is prima facie hard to square with everyday\nclaims about human dignity, which seem evenly spread over moral,\npolitical, and legal contexts. And it contradicts Shultziner (2007),\ndiscussed above. Moreover, Dimock (2012), Herzog (2012), and Rosen\n(2012b) challenge it directly, among others (see, e.g., Bird\n2013).\n\nMost important, however, in the greater context of discussing the\ndefining prosperities of dignity, it is to register Waldron\u2019s\nunderlying suggestion about an \u201cessential\u201d connection\nbetween dignity and rights. As we have seen, this claim finds wide\ntraction in the literature, even in accounts of dignity that are at\nodds with the Appiah-Waldron view of\n\u201cdignity-as-elevated-rank\u201d. For example, considering only\naccounts reviewed so far, Iglesias (2001) made the same claim; Darwall\n(2017) implies it; and both Kateb (2011) and Killmister (2020) endorse\nit in different ways. This raises an obvious question: What exactly is\nthe connection between dignity and rights?\n",
