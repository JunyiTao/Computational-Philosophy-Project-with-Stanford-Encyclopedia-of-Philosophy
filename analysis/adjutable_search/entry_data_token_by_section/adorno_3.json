    "main_text": "Aesthetic Theory\n4. Aesthetic Theory\n\n\nPhilosophical and sociological studies of the arts and literature make\nup more than half of Adorno's collected works (Gesammelte\nSchriften). All of his most important social-theoretical claims\nshow up in these studies. Yet his \u201caesthetic writings\u201d are\nnot simply \u201capplications\u201d or \u201ctest cases\u201d for\ntheses developed in \u201cnonaesthetic\u201d texts. Adorno rejects\nany such separation of subject matter from methodology and all neat\ndivisions of philosophy into specialized subdisciplines. This is one\nreason why academic specialists find his texts so challenging, not\nonly musicologists and literary critics but also epistemologists and\naestheticians.  All of his writings contribute to a comprehensive and\ninterdisciplinary social philosophy (Zuidervaart 2007).\n\n\nFirst published the year after Adorno died, Aesthetic Theory\nmarks the unfinished culmination of his remarkably rich body of\naesthetic reflections. It casts retrospective light on the entire\ncorpus. It also comes closest to the model of \u201cparatactical\npresentation\u201d (Hullot-Kentor in AT xi-xxi) that Adorno, inspired\nespecially by Walter Benjamin, found most appropriate for his own\n\u201catonal philosophy.\u201d Relentlessly tracing concentric circles,\nAesthetic Theory carries out a dialectical double\nreconstruction. It reconstructs the modern art movement from the\nperspective of philosophical aesthetics. It simultaneously\nreconstructs philosophical aesthetics, especially that of Kant and\nHegel, from the perspective of modern art. From both sides Adorno\ntries to elicit the sociohistorical significance of the art and\nphilosophy discussed.\n\n\nAdorno's claims about art in general stem from his reconstruction of\nthe modern art movement. So a summary of his philosophy of art\nsometimes needs to signal this by putting \u201cmodern\u201d in\nparentheses. The book begins and ends with reflections on the social\ncharacter of (modern) art. Two themes stand out in these\nreflections. One is an updated Hegelian question whether art can\nsurvive in a late capitalist world. The other is an updated Marxian\nquestion whether art can contribute to the transformation of this\nworld. When addressing both questions, Adorno retains from Kant the\nnotion that art proper (\u201cfine art\u201d or \u201cbeautiful\nart\u201d\u2014sch\u00f6ne Kunst\u2014in Kant's\nvocabulary) is characterized by formal autonomy. But Adorno combines\nthis Kantian emphasis on form with Hegel's emphasis on intellectual\nimport (geistiger Gehalt) and Marx's emphasis on art's\nembeddedness in society as a whole. The result is a complex account of\nthe simultaneous necessity and illusoriness of the artwork's autonomy.\nThe artwork's necessary and illusory autonomy, in turn, is the key to\n(modern) art's social character, namely, to be \u201cthe social\nantithesis of society\u201d (AT 8).\n\n\nAdorno regards authentic works of (modern) art as social monads. The\nunavoidable tensions within them express unavoidable conflicts within\nthe larger sociohistorical process from which they arise and to which\nthey belong. These tensions enter the artwork through the artist's\nstruggle with sociohistorically laden materials, and they call forth\nconflicting interpretations, many of which misread either the\nwork-internal tensions or their connection to conflicts in society as a\nwhole. Adorno sees all of these tensions and conflicts as\n\u201ccontradictions\u201d to be worked through and eventually to be resolved.\nTheir complete resolution, however, would require a transformation in\nsociety as a whole, which, given his social theory, does not seem\nimminent.\n\n\nAs commentary and criticism, Adorno's aesthetic writings are\nunparalleled in the subtlety and sophistication with which they trace\nwork-internal tensions and relate them to unavoidable sociohistorical\nconflicts. One gets frequent glimpses of this in Aesthetic\nTheory. For the most part, however, the book proceeds at the level\nof \u201cthird reflections\u201d\u2014reflections on categories employed in actual\ncommentary and criticism, with a view to their suitability for what\nartworks express and to their societal implications. Typically he\nelaborates these categories as polarities or dialectical pairs.\n\n\nOne such polarity, and a central one in Adorno's theory of artworks\nas social monads, occurs between the categories of import\n(Gehalt) and function (Funktion). Adorno's account of\nthese categories distinguishes his sociology of art from both\nhermeneutical and empirical approaches. A hermeneutical approach would\nemphasize the artwork's inherent meaning or its cultural significance\nand downplay the artwork's political or economic functions. An\nempirical approach would investigate causal connections between the\nartwork and various social factors without asking hermeneutical\nquestions about its meaning or significance. Adorno, by contrast,\nargues that, both as categories and as phenomena, import and function\nneed to be understood in terms of each other. On the one hand, an\nartwork's import and its functions in society can be diametrically\nopposed. On the other hand, one cannot give a proper account of an\nartwork's social functions if one does not raise import-related\nquestions about their significance. So too, an artwork's import\nembodies the work's social functions and has potential relevance for\nvarious social contexts. In general, however, and in line with his\ncritiques of positivism and instrumentalized reason, Adorno gives priority\nto import, understood as societally mediated and socially significant\nmeaning. The social functions emphasized in his own commentaries and\ncriticisms are primarily intellectual functions rather than\nstraightforwardly political or economic functions. This is consistent\nwith a hyperbolic version of the claim that (modern) art is society's\nsocial antithesis: \u201cInsofar as a social function can be predicated for\nartworks, it is their functionlessness\u201d (AT 227).\n\n\nThe priority of import also informs Adorno's stance on art and\npolitics, which derives from debates with Luk\u00e1cs, Benjamin, and\nBertolt Brecht in the 1930s (Lunn 1982; Zuidervaart 1991,\n28\u201343). Because of the shift in capitalism's structure, and because of\nAdorno's own complex emphasis on (modern) art's autonomy, he doubts\nboth the effectiveness and the legitimacy of tendentious, agitative,\nor deliberately consciousness-raising art. Yet he does see politically\nengaged art as a partial corrective to the bankrupt aestheticism of\nmuch mainstream art.  Under the conditions of late capitalism, the\nbest art, and politically the most effective, so thoroughly works out\nits own internal contradictions that the hidden contradictions in\nsociety can no longer be ignored. The plays of Samuel Beckett, to whom\nAdorno had intended to dedicate Aesthetic Theory, are\nemblematic in that regard.  Adorno finds them more true than many\nother artworks.\n\n\nArguably, the idea of \u201ctruth content\u201d (Wahrheitsgehalt) is\nthe pivotal center around which all the concentric circles of Adorno's\naesthetics turn (Zuidervaart 1991; Wellmer 1991, 1\u201335 ; Jarvis 1998,\n90\u2013123). To gain access to this center, one must temporarily suspend\nstandard theories about the nature of truth (whether as\ncorrespondence, coherence, or pragmatic success) and allow for\nartistic truth to be dialectical, disclosive, and\nnonpropositional. According to Adorno, each artwork has its own import\n(Gehalt) by virtue of an internal dialectic between content\n(Inhalt) and form (Form). This import invites\ncritical judgments about its truth or falsity. To do justice to the\nartwork and its import, such critical judgments need to grasp both the\nartwork's complex internal dynamics and the dynamics of the\nsociohistorical totality to which the artwork belongs. The artwork has\nan internal truth content to the extent that the artwork's import can\nbe found internally and externally either true or false. Such truth\ncontent is not a metaphysical idea or essence hovering outside the\nartwork. But neither is it a merely human construct. It is historical\nbut not arbitrary; nonpropositional, yet calling for propositional\nclaims to be made about it; utopian in its reach, yet firmly tied to\nspecific societal conditions. Truth content is the way in which an\nartwork simultaneously challenges the way things are and suggests how\nthings could be better, but leaves things practically unchanged: \u201cArt\nhas truth as the semblance of the illusionless\u201d (AT 132).\n",
