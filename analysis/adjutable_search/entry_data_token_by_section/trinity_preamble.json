    "main_text": "\n\nA Trinity doctrine is commonly expressed as the statement that the one\nGod exists as or in three equally divine \u201cPersons\u201d, the\nFather, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Every term in this statement\n(God, exists, as or in, equally divine, Person) has been variously\nunderstood. The guiding principle has been the creedal declaration\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit of the New Testament are\nconsubstantial (i.e. the same in substance or essence, Greek:\nhomoousios). Because this shared substance or essence is a\ndivine one, this is understood to imply that all three named\nindividuals are divine, and equally so. Yet the three in some sense\n\u201care\u201d the one God of the Bible.\n\nAfter its formulation and imperial enforcement towards the end of the\nfourth century, this sort of Christian theology reigned more or less\nunchallenged. But before this, and again in post-Reformation\nmodernity, the origin, meaning, and justification of trinitarian\ndoctrine has been repeatedly disputed. These debates are discussed in\nsupplementary documents to this entry. One aspect of these debates\nconcerns the self-consistency of trinitarian theology. If there are\nthree who are equally divine, isn\u2019t that to say there are at\nleast three gods? Yet the tradition asserts exactly one god. Is the\ntradition, then, incoherent, and so self-refuting? Since the revival\nof analytic philosophy of religion in the 1960s, many Christian\nphilosophers have pursued what is now called analytic theology, in\nwhich religious doctrines are given formulations which are precise,\nand it is hoped self-consistent and otherwise defensible. This article\nsurveys these recent \u201crational reconstructions\u201d of the\nTrinity doctrine, which employ concepts from contemporary analytic\nmetaphysics, logic, and epistemology.\n",
