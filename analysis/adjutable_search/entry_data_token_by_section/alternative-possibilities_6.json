    "main_text": "Arguments for PAP || Is the Principle Self-Evident?\n2.1 Is the Principle Self-Evident?\n\nOne quick argument is that PAP is self-evident; alternatively, it is\nimmediately known a priori, intuitively obvious, or analytic.\nThose who deny it are thereby convicted of confusion about moral\nresponsibility, the ability to do otherwise, or both. If PAP does\nenjoy such a high epistemic status, this explains its wide acceptance\nin the major historical periods of philosophy, a discipline not\nusually known for producing even approximate consensus. But in spite\nof this agreement, the principle has turned out not to be so obvious,\nand in fact appears to make a substantive, controversial claim about\nresponsibility. Witness some notable dissenters, including the Stoics,\nAugustine, Aquinas, and Hobbes (see, respectively,\n \u00a73.2;\n Hunt 1999; Stump 1997; Martinich 2005). Moreover, PAP has come under\nsustained attack in recent decades due in large part to the early\nefforts of Frankfurt (1969), Fischer (1982), and Dennett (1984a,b).\nThis is enough to show that, however plausible PAP might first appear,\nit requires more than this quick defense.\n",
