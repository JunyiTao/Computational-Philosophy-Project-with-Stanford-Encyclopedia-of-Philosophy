According to believers, God governs creation as a loving\nfather, working all things for good. Moreover, it is said, God is an\nabsolutely perfect being. He is, first of all, omniscient or\nall-knowing: he knows of all truths that they are true, and of all\nfalsehoods that they are false, whether they pertain to past, present\nor future. And God\u2019s knowledge does not change. Nothing is\nlearned or forgotten with him; what he knows, he knows from eternity\nand infallibly. Second, God is omnipotent or all-powerful: anything\nthat is logically possible, he can do. Finally, God is perfectly good:\nin all circumstances he acts for the best, intending the best possible\noutcome. Given these suppositions, our initial expectation would be\nthat all of creation, animate and inanimate, is ordained to perfect\ngood: that as creator God pitches his efforts, which none can resist,\ntoward accomplishing the greatest good imaginable, and hence that the\nworld in which we find ourselves is, as Leibniz put it, the best of\nall possible worlds. But alas, the evidence is otherwise. The world\nmay contain much good, but it is also a place of suffering,\ndestruction, and death. Life is brief, and afflicted with sorrows of\nevery kind\u2014as often as not with no discernible purpose at all,\nmuch less a good one. And it ends for each of us in personal\ndestruction\u2014in death, which trumps all worldly hopes, and\nconceals impenetrably any experience that may lie beyond. Nor are\nthese mere human hardships. Every living thing dies, all that is\nbeautiful perishes, everything nature builds is destroyed. Indeed, on\none scientific account of the end of things not an atom, not a photon\nwill escape the cauldron of the universe\u2019s final collapse. And\nthat is not all. In human affairs there is the additional evil of sin:\nthe willful wrongdoing of which we all are at times victims and at\nother times perpetrators. How can all of this be, if God\u2019s\nnature is as tradition postulates?\n", "toc": [{"#LogConIndEvi": "1. Logical Consistency and Inductive Evidence"}, {"#FreWilDef": "2.

Logical Consistency and Inductive Evidence\n\nWhat is described above is the problem of evil. Because evil\nposes the most difficult problems for traditional views of divine\nprovidence, this discussion will be organized around the theme of\nevil. In its classical formulation, the problem of evil is a problem\nof logical consistency. The opponent of theism alleges that a triad of\nproperties traditionally held to belong to God\u2019s nature \u2014\nomniscience, omnipotence and omnibenevolence \u2014 are not jointly\nconsistent with the existence of evil in the world. An omniscient God,\nwe must assume, would have knowledge of the evil in the world. An\nomnibenevolent God would desire to halt or prevent it, and an\nomnipotent God should be able to do so. Yet evil is rife. It must be,\nthen, that God lacks at least one of the triad of attributes, and\nperhaps all of them. Perhaps as creator he is somewhat in the dark as\nto what evils may occur, and once they appear it is too late to\nforestall them. On the other hand, it may be that evil is endemic\n\u2014 built into the structure of any world, so that even God is\npowerless to prevent it. Or, maybe he just doesn\u2019t care, and has\nlong since turned his attention to projects more interesting than\nnurturing our feeble destinies. Whatever the reason, the argument\nruns, he is not the God of Abraham, of Jesus, and of Mohammed. Their\nGod simply would not permit wanton wrongdoing, nor would he allow the\nsuffering and duress under which all creation labors. So while the\npresence of evil in the world does not serve to prove there is no God\nat all, it does show there is no God of the kind adumbrated in\nreligious tradition.\n\nThe logical problem of evil may be countered with a logical rejoinder.\nThe fact is that the three perfections described above are not by\nthemselves sufficient to exclude the existence of evil in creation. To\nget that result we have to add a crucial premise to the argument put\nforth by opponents of theism: that there can be no justification for\nevil, no good reason why a God with the attributes in question would\ncreate a world that contained it. But why suppose this is so? Perhaps\nthere is some good or goods that are possible only in a world that\ncontains or at least permits evil, and without which creation would be\nvastly inferior to what it is. If that were true, then an all-good and\nall-loving God would not shrink from creating a world that contained\nthe evil necessary for that good or goods to be\n achieved.[1]\n So there is no final inconsistency here, and the theist may wish to\nconclude on that basis that the problem of evil is resolved. But not\nyet. For the opponent may concede that the presence of evil in the\nworld does not entail that there is no God of the kind\nreligious tradition postulates. Still, he may hold, it gives us good\ninductive reason for thinking there is no such God. The pervasiveness\nand profundity of the evil that occurs, the fact that it so often\nfalls upon the innocent and helpless, and the simple fact that we can\nsee no good coming from most of it are more than enough reason,\naccording to this argument, for any rational person to reject the God\nof tradition. What good could possibly justify the Holocaust, or\nwholesale destruction of civilian populations in war? Or, lest the\nnumbers submerge the agony, consider just a single case of innocent\nsuffering, posed by William Rowe: a fawn burned horribly in a forest\nfire somewhere removed from any human awareness, doomed to days of\nlingering suffering before inevitable death (1979, 337). We are unable\nto discern any good coming from this single instance of evil, and the\nsame could doubtless be said for millions of others. What more reason\ncould a rational person demand for rejecting the God of our\nfathers?\n\nThis so-called inductive or evidential argument from evil may be met\nwith a response similar to the one directed against the logical\nargument, for the fact is that it too involves assumptions which, when\nbrought to light, seem questionable. It assumes that for each instance\nof evil that occurs, we humans will be able to detect any good toward\nwhich it might be directed, and that we will be able to tell whether\nthe good is achieved, whether it was worth the evil sustained in\nreaching it, and whether it could better have been achieved without\nthe attendant evil. Again, however, why assume any of this is so? It\nis not obvious, in the first place, that goods and evils are\ncommensurable in the way this argument seems to suppose\u2014that is,\nthat we are able to grade goods and evils on a common scale, and then\nmeasure the value of the good against the bad (Swinburne 1998, ch.\n13). But even if we could do this, an all-powerful, all-knowing and\nall-loving God could easily have aims exceeding any we have ever\nimagined. How they are achieved at all, much less the role sin and\nsuffering may play in their achievement, could in principle escape us\nutterly (Howard-Snyder 1996). If so, then we would still be in no\nposition to make the kinds of determinations about the role evil plays\nin the world, and how dispensable it may be, that the evidential\nargument presupposes. Still less should we expect to be able to make\nsuch determinations in every case, which is what the argument demands.\nAs with the logical problem of evil, then, the theist may greet the\nexperiential problem with a stand-pat position. Neither argument goes\nthrough unless we make assumptions we have no reason to make, and\nwhich when brought to light seem positively implausible.\n\nStill, evil is troubling, and anyone troubled by it is likely to be\nleft unsatisfied by the stand-pat response. For one thing, the\nargument cuts both ways. If we are unable to discern God\u2019s\npurposes then just as he may turn out to be a far better being than\nour experience would indicate, so also he may turn out to be far\nworse: a positively evil or incompetent God, undeserving even of\nregard, let alone worship. Moreover, this response seems out of\nkeeping with the spirit of the Western religious tradition. That\ntradition is at home with the concept of mystery: it speaks often of\naspects of God and his relationship to the world that outreach us, in\nthat our intellects are not finally able to grasp them. But seldom if\never does the tradition treat mystery as totally impenetrable. Just\nthe opposite: the whole point of the theological enterprise is to\nenable the believer to understand, however imperfectly, the nature of\nGod and the plan of salvation. It is hard to see how this aim can be\nachieved if a phenomenon as central as evil must be held to escape all\ncomprehension, nor is there any special reason to expect such a thing.\nRather, it is in keeping with the hope of the believer that there\nshould be available some glimpse of the good accomplished through the\npresence of sin and suffering in the world, even if in the actual\nstruggle with them one\u2019s best ally is faith. If this is correct,\nthen the theist should not limit his options to the negative. Beyond\npointing out the shortcomings of the opponent\u2019s arguments, he\ncan and should try to offer a positive theodicy \u2014 that\nis, an account of the role evil plays in the world, and a\njustification for its presence. Such an effort is likely, of course,\nto end up incomplete. In particular, the theist may be unable in many\ncases to point to a good to which some evil that occurs is\nindispensable. But he may want to be able to offer a general\njustification for the presence of evil, and to describe some good or\ngoods which but for the occurrence of evil could not be achieved. The\nquestion is whether he can do so without compromising divine\nperfection.\n2. The Free Will Defense\n\nIt may be possible to minimize God\u2019s involvement in the evil of\nthe universe. That is the aim of what is perhaps the most prominent\nstrategy employed in recent theodicy, which is based on the concept of\nfree will, and its importance in the plan of creation. The free will\ndefense begins by distinguishing two kinds of evil. Moral\nevil is evil that occurs through rational action \u2014 that is,\nthrough wrongful exercises of will on the part of rational beings.\nNatural evil, by contrast, is owing entirely to the operation\nof natural causes. To see how this distinction works, we need to\nrealize that moral evil can itself be divided into several categories.\nFirst come exercises of will that are sinful in themselves, and these\nare of two kinds. They include wrongful acts of intention formation,\nas when one maliciously decides to kill another, and the volitional\nactivity through which we execute wrong intentions \u2014 e.g., the\neffort of will aimed at carrying out the intention to murder. The\nmoral wrong of these exercises of will is intrinsic to them.\nThey are sinful in themselves, and would be so even if, through some\nfortuitous circumstance, the attempt to kill went awry, and the\nintended victim was not harmed at all. Suppose, however, that the\naction succeeds, as it does in most instances of wrongful willing. If\nso, further evil will occur \u2014 in the present case, the death of\nthe victim. Now if the victim had died entirely as a result of natural\ncauses, his death would have counted as a natural evil. In this case,\nhowever, it counts as a kind of moral evil, for while its occurrence\nrequires the cooperation of natural causes, those causes are set in\nmotion by the killer\u2019s volitional activity. Harm and suffering\nthat are caused by wrongful willing count as extrinsic moral\nevil, in that they are caused by acts of will that are morally evil in\nthemselves, or intrinsically.\n\nThe significance and pervasiveness of extrinsic moral evil is easy to\nunderestimate, because a lot of the suffering and hardship that\nbelongs in this category tends to masquerade as merely part of the\nhuman condition, and hence as natural evil. But it is not so. Many of\nthe hardships that befall humankind \u2014 disease, ignorance,\npoverty and the like \u2014 owe their existence at least in part to\nwrongful willing. The poverty of some is owing to the greed of others;\nsuffering and deprivation may occur because of institutionalized\nracial and ethnic hatred, or because leaders use their positions to\nadvance their own power and prosperity at the expense of their\ncitizenry, or simply because the cost of defense against foreign\nenemies brings economic hardship to a nation or some of its members.\nIn other cases the cause is sheer laziness, or the fact that time and\ntalent that might have been devoted to good are instead consumed by\nselfish ends. Who can estimate how much of suffering and disease, of\npoverty and ignorance, or of the threat posed by natural disasters\nwould by now have been conquered were not so much of our energy and\nresources diverted either to the pursuit of wrongful goals, or to\nguarding ourselves against those who do pursue them, and mending as\nwell as we can the harm they cause? If human wills were not so often\nmisdirected, human life would be transformed, and the struggles\nagainst those evils that seem to us no one\u2019s fault much further\nadvanced. A great deal, then, of what we are likely to view as natural\nevil actually falls under the heading of extrinsic moral evil.\n\nThat all of sin and so much of suffering counts as moral evil is\nadvantageous to free will theodicy, for according to the free will\ndefense moral evil is not to be blamed upon God. It is entirely our\nfault \u2014 that is, entirely the fault of rational beings who\nemploy their wills to pursue evil. This is because we have free\nwill, which is to be understood here in what is known as the\nlibertarian sense. We exercise libertarian freedom in forming\nor executing an intention only if our deciding or willing is not the\nproduct of deterministic causation \u2014 that is, provided there is\nno set of conditions independent of our exercise of will which,\ntogether with scientific law, make it certain that we shall decide or\nwill as we do. Independent conditions \u2014 our motives and beliefs,\nfor example \u2014 may incline us toward one or another intention or\naction. But they cannot guarantee it, because what we decide and what\nwe strive to achieve is finally up to us. Were it not so, we could not\nbe held accountable for our actions. We would be no more responsible\nthan someone who acted out of a psychological compulsion such as\nkleptomania, or who was a victim of addiction, hypnosis or the\nlike.\n\nGiven the nature of libertarian freedom, then, our actions are up to\nus, in that they are not brought about by independent events. And\nbecause this is so, according to free will theodicy, moral evil is\nentirely our fault. God is not to be blamed for it, because it owes\nits existence to our wills, not to his (Plantinga 1974, 30). God is,\nof course, responsible for the risk he takes in creating a world that\ncontains beings with free will. But proponents of the free will\ndefense can point to two reasons that could justify God in populating\nthe universe with such creatures. First, they are an enhancement to\ncreation. Creatures with free will are sources of spontaneity in the\nworld, able to choose for themselves the principles by which their\nconduct will be guided. As such, they display the kind of liberty we\ntake God himself to have, and so are made in the image of their\ncreator (Swinburne 1998, 106). Second, God endows us with this power\nbecause he desires creatures who will accept him freely, who will love\nand obey him not because they are programmed to do so, but as a matter\nof spontaneous choice. That we should come to love God in this way is\nfar more satisfactory than that we should be driven to accept him. As\nin strictly human affairs, forced affection is a pale substitute for\nlove voluntarily bestowed. But, the argument goes, God cannot endow us\nwith free will without running the risk that some of us, at least,\nwill turn against him, and use our freedom to seek evil ends. True,\nsuch ends are usually not achieved unless nature, which is God\u2019s\ncreation, cooperates. The bullet could not find its mark or the poison\nbe effective unless the relevant natural laws stayed in place. In\nprinciple, then, God could allow us free choice and yet prevent any\nchoice that is evil from having its intended outcome. But freedom\nwould be a sham if an evil will could never have its way, and the\nlocus of sin lies not in the consequences of evil willing but in the\nwilling itself. Moreover, even though the harm we cause through our\nactions requires God\u2019s cooperation, it too would not occur but\nfor our choosing and willing as we do. The price of freedom, then, is\nmoral evil. But moral evil is to be laid at our doorstep, not\nGod\u2019s, for it is we who choose it. God merely permits our\nchoices and makes them efficacious. In this he is justified, first\nbecause of the good of there being free creatures in the universe, and\nsecond because some, and perhaps many or even all, of these creatures\nwill come to enjoy God\u2019s eternal friendship, by choosing freely\nto love and serve him.\n\nThe free will defense does not, in most formulations, attempt a\ncomplete solution to the problem of evil. It deals only with moral\nevil, and although we have seen that this category covers more than\nmight at first be supposed, it certainly does not appear that all of\nthe sorrows and failures of the world can be gathered under it. Even\nif the free will defense succeeds then, there will remain a residuum\nof natural evil to be addressed. It may, however, be questioned\nwhether the defense succeeds even in the limited project it\nundertakes. One criticism of it raises a question about the relation\nbetween creaturely freedom and God\u2019s activity as creator. J. L.\nMackie has argued that if God is truly all-powerful, he ought to have\nbeen able to create creatures who possessed free will, but who never\ndid wrong (1955, 209). If that were possible, then we would have had a\nuniverse free of moral evil, even though it contained creatures with\nfree will. Perhaps the sinful populace that presently inhabits the\nworld would have lost out on such a scenario: maybe God would have had\nto create an entirely different crowd. Still, moral evil would have\nbeen banished, and the condition of the world doubtless vastly\nimproved. But could God have exerted such control over creation?\nProponents of the free will defense have tended to think not. In order\nfor God to provide creatures with meaningful freedom, they argue, God\nmust relinquish control over how that freedom is exercised. Were it\nnot so, libertarian freedom would be destroyed: our decisions and\nactions would not finally be up to us, but would instead be\nmanipulated by God (Plantinga 1974, 41\u201342; Flint 1998,\n84\u201390). Even if they were exempt from natural causation, they\nwould still be determined by God\u2019s will, and so would be unfree.\nIndeed, the argument runs, it would be logically impossible for God to\ncreate creatures possessed of libertarian freedom, and at the same\ntime have the operations of their will fall under his creative\nfiat. Now it is not usually considered a failure of\nomnipotence for God to be unable to do what is logically impossible.\nWe need not, therefore, relinquish the claim that God is all-powerful.\nRather, the theist concludes, Mackie is simply mistaken in thinking\nsuch a God could create free creatures with a guarantee that they\nwould never sin.\n\nIt should be pointed out that in giving this response, proponents of\nthe free will defense are making an important assumption about the\nrelationship between God\u2019s will as creator and ours as creatures\n\u2014 namely, that God\u2019s will operates in the same way natural\ncauses do. That is, his fiat as creator counts as an\nindependent condition or event, which causes the occurrence of what he\nwills in just the way natural causes produce their effects. So if, as\ncreator, God wills that I decide to attend a concert this evening,\nthen my decision to do so is causally determined, just as it would be\nhad I been driven to it by an insatiable desire for Beethoven.\nOtherwise, we would not have a violation of the criterion for\nlibertarian free will given earlier. Now we shall eventually see that\nthis model of the relation between God\u2019s will and the world is\nat best unlikely, but let us suppose for now that the theist\u2019s\nanswer to Mackie\u2019s complaint stands. Is the free will defense\nthen successful? Again, it seems not, for the antitheist can still\nraise two complaints, and these amount to two challenges that any\ntheory of providence which desires to avail itself of the free will\ndefense must overcome.\n\nFirst, he may argue, even if the free will defense does not violate\nGod\u2019s omnipotence, it still violates his sovereignty. If God\nwere fully sovereign over the universe his rule would be complete. All\nthat occurs would be under his direct control, down to the smallest\ndetail. According to the free will defense, however, this is not so.\nRather, as we have just seen, proponents of this kind of theodicy\ninsist that some of what goes on in the world is not under God\u2019s\ncontrol, but under that of his creatures. To be sure, God need not\nhave created free beings, and when they engage in sinful willing he\ncan always thwart their ends by manipulating natural causes. But he\ncannot stop them from sinning (or, for that matter, from willing\nwell), for both of these lie with the will itself. So in creating free\ncreatures God relinquishes part of his sovereignty over the universe\n(Mackie 1955, 209\u201310; Flint 1998, 84\u201385). Furthermore,\nunless God regularly interferes with his creatures achieving their own\nobjectives\u2014that is, unless he deprives them of a meaningful and\nefficacious freedom\u2014his own objectives in creating the universe\nare likely to be thwarted. However great a good it may be to have in\nthe universe creatures who exercise libertatian freedom, this would\nseem a high and unseemly price for an otherwise sovereign God to pay\nfor their existence.\n\nSecond, the antitheist may argue, the free will defense violates\ndivine omniscience. For if I possess libertarian freedom, then whether\nI decide to go to the concert tonight is neither under God\u2019s\ndirect control nor controlled by natural causes. And if that is the\ncase then God has no way of knowing what I will decide. Like anyone,\nhe can make a lucky guess: he may believe devoutly that I will decide\nto attend the concert, and that may turn out to be correct. But lucky\nguesses do not count as knowledge. Knowledge requires reasons, and God\ncan have no satisfactory reason for his belief, if by\n\u201csatisfactory\u201d we understand what the infallible\nomniscience usually attributed to him would require \u2014 namely, a\nreason that guarantees correctness. Rather, like any observer, God\nmust wait to learn what my decision will be in order to be sure of it.\nBut then throughout the time prior to my act, God is not omniscient.\nThere is a truth about the future that he does not know. Thus, the\nantitheist may conclude, the free will defense is in fact a failure.\nIt exonerates God from direct responsibility for sin, but it does so\nonly by surrendering part of God\u2019s sovereignty, and by making\nhim fail, as creator, to be omniscient.\n3. God\u2019s Knowledge of the Future and Open Theism\n\nIt is fair to say that philosophers responding to these difficulties\nhave been more concerned to preserve God\u2019s omniscience than his\nsovereignty. Perhaps this is in part because philosophy is itself a\nmatter of pursuing knowledge, so that philosophers are led to value\nomniscience more highly. Were we generals, say, or politicians, our\npriorities might be quite the opposite. In any case, most discussions\nof the seeming conflict between creaturely freedom and divine\nperfection have concentrated on the task of reconciling as far as\npossible the assertion that we have free will with the claim that God\nis all-knowing. One especially important way of doing so is to hold\nthat God\u2019s position with respect to time is such that unlike us,\nhe does not have to wait for the future to unfold in order to know its\ncontents. Such was the view of Boethius, who held that God exists\nentirely outside of time, in a kind of eternal present to which all\nthat occurs in time is equally accessible (Consolation, Bk. V, pr.\n6). Thus, God is able in a single act of awareness to comprehend\nall of history, the past and future as well as the present, just as\nthough they were now occurring. Many philosophers have followed\nBoethius in this, holding that God is in no way a temporal being, but\nis rather the creator of time, with complete and equal access to all\nof its\n contents.[2]\n And it may well appear that on such a view God\u2019s omniscience is\nrestored, in that he has immediate cognitive access to everything that\nwill ever occur. Moreover, there is no conflict with libertarian\nfreedom, since on this account God\u2019s knowledge of our future\ndecisions and actions is not really foreknowledge. Rather,\nthe vantage point from which God knows our decisions and actions is\ncompletely external to time. This makes all talk about\n\u201cwhen\u201d God knows about our actions pointless. He simply\nknows them, in a unified, timeless and unchanging act of comprehension\nthat comprises all that ever was or will be.\n\nThere are criticisms of the idea that God is timeless (Wolterstorff\n1982). But even if the Boethian position is correct on this score, the\nusefulness of this means of reconciling divine omniscience and human\nfreedom is highly questionable. The difficulty is that in order for\nGod to exercise full providence over the world, he needs to know\nas creator how the decisions and actions of creatures with\nlibertarian freedom will go. It is hard to see how that is possible on\nthe Boethian view, for even if God is outside of time, his activity as\ncreator is still ontologically prior to the activities of\nfree creatures on this account, whereas his knowledge of those\nactivities is posterior to them. Thus, it seems impossible\nthat God\u2019s creative will could be guided by his knowledge of our\nactions, even if, from his timeless perspective, such knowledge is\nfinally available to him. If this is correct, then even the Boethian\nGod runs an immense risk in creating the world. He can only hope that\nwe will use our freedom justly and wisely, perhaps making some\nallowance for the possibility that we will not, but otherwise simply\ntrusting in the outcome. So although God\u2019s omniscience may be\nrestored by placing him outside of time, he is in no way empowered by\nit. (Whether the Boethian God\u2019s simple foreknowledge grants any\nprovidential advantage at all is a matter of dispute, but undeniably\nthe Boethian God must run significant risks in creating the world. For\nan entry into the debate, see Hunt 2009, Hasker 2009, and Zimmerman\n2012.)\n\nIt may be questioned, furthermore, whether this view of things really\nis consistent with the claim that God is timeless. The Boethian\npicture appears to call for a kind of transition, wherein God first\ncreates free creatures in ignorance of what their actions will be and\nthen learns about those actions by observation. But if that is so then\nthere appears to be change in God, in which case he would have to be a\ntemporal being after all. Now perhaps there is some way around this\nproblem: maybe as creator God somehow operates in isolation from\ncertain parts of his knowledge, while having access to all of it in\nhis role as knower \u2014 and yet remains timeless in both\ncapacities. Still, it is not satisfying that God should be limited in\nthis way. His activity as creator ought to be completely unhampered.\nMoreover, the bifurcation in God\u2019s thinking called for by this\nadjustment only reinforces the difficulty of treating creaturely\ndecisions and actions as falling under divine providence. As creator,\non this account, God really does not know what kind of world he is\ncreating: how evil it will be, whence the evil will arise, and how to\nanticipate it in detail in the plan of creation.\n\nOne may be tempted at this point simply to throw in the towel, to give\nup the endeavor to reconcile libertarian freedom with divine\nsovereignty and omniscience. If so, we may still insist on libertarian\nfreedom for creatures. But if we are convinced this is incompatible\nwith holding that God is omniscient, and that everything that takes\nplace in the created world falls under his complete governance, then\nthese claims will go by the board. On this type of theory, commonly\ncalled the \u201cOpen\u201d view or Open Theism, God is a temporal\nbeing who, like us, must await the actions of free creatures in order\nto know with certainty what they will be. And much that occurs, most\nespecially sinful decisions and willings, will not be of his choosing.\nNot that he is completely in the dark: God can still have\nprobabilistic knowledge of how his creatures will act, and he can\ncontrive to place them in circumstances designed to elicit if possible\nwhatever behavior will achieve the most good. And of course he still\nhas the power to motivate and punish, so creatures may be guided\ntoward right paths. Accordingly, God is still able to exercise a sort\nof general providence over the world, guiding it in the direction of\nhis objectives as creator, or at least something approximating them\n(Rhoda 2010a). But his providence can never be, as is sometimes said,\n\u201cmeticulous.\u201d Rather, on this scenario God\u2019s aims as\ncreator can only be achieved \u2014 assuming they will be achieved at\nall \u2014 by taking risks. Inevitably, creaturely free will makes\nfor a setting of uncertainty, and only within that setting can God\nattempt to bring creation to a happy outcome. Yet he proceeds, and his\ndoing so is a measure of his love for us.(See Hasker 1989 and Pinnock\net. al. 1994.)\n\nSuch a position may appeal to philosophers who find the God of perfect\nbeing theology too remote and mysterious to equate with the God of\nscripture. But this viewpoint faces serious problems. Some are\nrelatively specific. For example, it is hard to see how, if even God\ndoes not know what they will be, the actions of free creatures could\nbe the subject of prophecy. Yet they often are, in scripture (Flint\n1998, 100\u201302). Also, there will no doubt be many cases where\nmultiple free actions impinge on some outcome God desires. When that\nis so, the probabilities of those actions need to be multiplied to\ndetermine God\u2019s assurance of the outcome, which as a result\ncould be minuscule (Flint 1998, 104). But the biggest difficulty is\nthat this view places God\u2019s fate as creator almost completely in\nthe hands of his creatures. No matter how concerned and loving he may\nbe, or how powerfully he attempts to win us over, we are on this view\nout of God\u2019s control. There is always the chance, therefore,\nthat his plans as creator will be utterly dashed, that his overtures\nto us will be rejected \u2014 even to the point, one supposes, of our\nall being lost \u2014 that we will use our freedom and advancing\nknowledge to wreak ever greater horror, and that creation will turn\nout to be a disaster. Willingness to take chances may be laudable in\nsome cases, but surely this level of risk is irresponsible. Moreover,\nit is completely out of keeping with both scripture and tradition,\nboth of which portray God as above the fray of the world, unperturbed\nby its mishaps, and governing its course with complete power and\nassurance. On the Open view, divine governance is a hit or miss\naffair, in which we can only wait to see whether a somewhat poorly\ninformed God will manage to bootstrap his way to his objectives.\nSurely, opponents argue, this gives away too much of the traditional\nnotion of providence.\n\nOne tactic for preserving omniscience even while accepting the basic\nopen theist view just described is to hold that God cannot be faulted\nfor not knowing in advance how we will exercise our freedom, since\nuntil we do there is simply nothing to know. According to views of\nthis kind, not all propositions about the future have a truth value.\nSome do, of course: it is a necessary truth that 2 + 2 = 4, and this\nproposition has as much bearing on the future as it does on the\npresent and past. Similarly, a proposition concerning the future may\nhave a truth value when its truth is causally determined. Consider,\nfor example, the proposition that the sun will rise tomorrow. Most\nlikely, it is true. True or false, however, this proposition\u2019s\ntruth value is fixed by causes already in place, causes that determine\neither that the sun will rise tomorrow or that it will not. But now\nconsider the claim that I will decide an hour from now to attend a\nconcert this evening. If I have free will, there are no conditions\npresently in place that determine whether I will so decide. This being\nthe case, according to the present view, the proposition that I will\ndecide in an hour to attend the concert is neither true nor false. It\nhas no truth value at all, nor does any other proposition that\ndescribes a future free decision or action. But then, the argument\nruns, it is not a mark against his omniscience that in creating us,\nGod does not know how we will exercise our freedom. It is logically\nimpossible to know of a proposition that it is true or that it is\nfalse if it is neither. And inability to know what logically cannot be\nknown does not harm God\u2019s omniscience, any more than inability\nto do what logically cannot be done harms his omnipotence (Swinburne\n1993, 180\u201381). A distinct but related view is that all future\ncontingents are in fact false, because there is nothing in the future\nto make them true, and so the fact that God does not know ahead of\ntime which of them becomes true is not an epistemic failure on his\npart (see Todd 2016).\n\nIf correct, this view would indeed reconcile divine omniscience and\ncreaturely freedom, leaving only the problem of sovereignty to be\naddressed. But there are telling arguments against it. Propositions\nthat venture to predict future free decisions and actions do appear to\nhave truth values, and some of them appear to be true. One indication\nof this is that we believe and disbelieve such propositions, and what\nis it to believe a proposition but to believe it is true, or to\ndisbelieve it but to believe it is false? Nor does it seem possible to\nworm our way out of this. Let p be the proposition that I\nwill decide to attend a concert this evening. It might be protested\nthat for someone to believe I will so decide is only to believe\np will become true at the appointed time \u2014\ni.e., at the time of my decision. But that does not solve the problem,\nfor to believe this is simply to believe another future-tensed\nproposition \u2014 namely, \u201cp will become true\u201d\n\u2014 which is just as dependent on my decision for its truth as is\np. Similarly, it will not do to claim that to believe\np is not to believe it is true but only that it is likely or\nprobable. For to hold these beliefs is just to hold, respectively,\nthat it is likely that p is true, or probable that it is\ntrue. In short, there seems no avoiding the fact that to believe\np is to be committed to its truth, pure and simple. Moreover,\nanyone thus committed would, if I later decide to attend the concert,\nbe justified in saying they had been right about what I would decide,\nthat their earlier belief had been correct. And again, what is it for\na belief to be right or correct except for it to be true? (For a\nrelated argument, see Pruss 2010, to which Rhoda 2010b replies.)\n\nIn any case, the concern remains that open theism leaves the\ntraditional strong view of divine providence in tatters in favor of a\nrisk-taking God. A better solution would be preferable, if one can be\nhad.\n4. Middle Knowledge\n\nA possible way to reconcile libertarian views of freedom with a strong\nview of divine providence was posed by the sixteenth-century Spanish\nJesuit, Luis de Molina\n (1588).[3]\n According to Molina, God is able to know as creator how any\nexercise of creaturely freedom will go. That is, God knows, for any\ncreature he might create, how that creature will behave in whatever\ncircumstances he might be placed. God is able to know this, moreover,\neven though the creatures in question will, if created, enjoy\nlibertarian freedom. This kind of knowledge, which Molina called\nmiddle\n knowledge,[4]\n is comprised in what we may call subjunctives of freedom.\nConsider, for example, the situation in which I will find myself later\ntoday, when I deliberate about whether to attend the concert tonight.\nIt is possible to formulate two subjunctive conditional propositions\nabout that situation. The first states that if ever I were placed in\nthe circumstances (call them C) that will then obtain, I\nwould decide (freely) to attend the concert; the second states that in\nthose circumstances, I would not so decide. Let these be symbolized as\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p and\nC\u00a0>\u00a0~p, respectively. Both\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p and\nC\u00a0>\u00a0~p count as subjunctives of\nfreedom, and since we are imagining that I will be placed in\nC later today, it is plausible to think that one or the other\nof them is true. Let us suppose it is\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p. According to defenders of middle\nknowledge, God knows prior to any creative act on his part that\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p is true; hence he knows this\nprior to my existence, and prior to any act of mine. We need not take\nthe \u201cprior\u201d here as temporal, if we hold that God exists\noutside of time. The idea, rather, is that the truth of\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p is logically or ontologically\nprior to any creative decision on God\u2019s part, and to any doing\nof mine, in that its truth is fixed independently of these matters.\nFurther, God is able to know that\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p is true independently of any\ndecision of his, and without appealing to any actual decision on my\npart as evidence. Finally, God is armed with true subjunctives of\nfreedom for every other set of circumstances in which I might ever\nhave been placed, and the same for every other free individual he has\nthe option of creating, whether he actually chooses to create the\ncreature or not. In effect, then, middle knowledge gives God advance\nnotice of every free decision or action that would ever occur, on the\npart of any creature he might create (Flint 1998, 37\u201341).\n\nAssuming it is a legitimate notion, middle knowledge does much to\nrestore God\u2019s providence in creating free creatures. Once armed\nwith information about how such a creature would decide and act in the\nvarious circumstances in which he might be placed, God has the option\nof not creating the creature, or of creating him in whatever\ncircumstances are called for by the subjunctives of freedom God wishes\nto be realized in the actual world. Now of course the circumstances in\nwhich one creature is placed may depend in part on how others choose\nto exercise their freedom. But the willings of those others can in\nturn be providentially arranged, since they too fall under middle\nknowledge. In principle, then, nothing need occur in the actual world\nthat does not have God\u2019s prior recognition and consent, at\nleast. There may, of course, be much that does not go as God would\nprefer. It is important to realize that middle knowledge does not\nrestore complete sovereignty to God. If\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p is true, then there is no way for\nGod to create me in circumstances C and have me do anything\nbut decide to go to the concert. The best he can do is alter my\ncircumstances to fit some true subjunctive of freedom that has another\noutcome. And the same goes for the subjunctives of freedom that hold\nof all other creatures God might create. This means there is quite a\nrange of worlds which, though logically possible, are not\nfeasible for God, in that they are beyond his reach as\ncreator (Flint 1998, 71). From God\u2019s point of view, free\ncreatures will behave as they will behave, and that is that. Still,\nGod can know in advance of creation what worlds are feasible, and can\nplan accordingly, which is a vast improvement over the Boethian view.\nThe position as regards omniscience is also improved. There is still a\nkind of transition called for \u2014 this time commencing from a\npoint at which God merely contemplates the possibilities of how things\nmight go with creation, to a point at which, having decided\nwhat creatures and circumstances will in fact populate the world, he\nknows how things will go. Again, however, it might be\npossible to work out a way in which the transition can be understood\nnon-temporally. And the Molinist position offers a further advantage\nover that of Boethius, in that now God\u2019s knowledge about how\nexercises of creaturely freedom will actually go will be guaranteed\nsimply by his decision as to what creatures and circumstances he will\ncreate, rather than awaiting the actual decisions and actions of free\nbeings. This diminishes God\u2019s passivity; it enables him to know\nas creator how the history of creation will\n unfold.[5]\n\nBut is middle knowledge a legitimate notion? Many have\nthought not. One serious objection against it is that there does not\nappear to be any way God could come by such knowledge. Knowledge, as\nwe have seen, is not merely a matter of conceiving a proposition and\ncorrectly believing it to be true. It requires justification:\none must have good reasons for believing. But what justification could\nGod have for believing the propositions that are supposed to\nconstitute middle knowledge? The truth of subjunctives of freedom\ncannot be discerned a priori, for they are contingent. It is not a\nnecessary truth that if placed in circumstances C, I will\ndecide to attend the concert tonight. Nor can we allow that God might\nlearn the truth of C\u00a0>\u00a0p from my actual\nbehavior \u2014 that is, by observing that I actually do, in\ncircumstances C, decide to attend the concert. For God could\nnot make observations like this without also finding out what creative\ndecisions he is actually going to make, which would destroy the whole\npurpose of middle knowledge. Instead of being guided in his creative\nchoices by knowing what decisions creatures would make if\nthey were created, God would be presented from the beginning with a\nfait accompli \u2014 with the reality that he was\ngoing to create certain creatures, and they were going to\nbehave in certain ways. For God\u2019s options as creator to remain\ntruly open, middle knowledge must have some other justification.\nFurthermore, it seems clear that observation of the actual behavior of\ncreatures could not possibly inform God of the truth of those\nsubjunctives of freedom that delineate the behavior of creatures he\nwill not choose to create, for in their case there is no\npertinent reality to consult. Yet Molinism wishes to allow for the\npossibility of such creatures. It is apparent, then, that neither\nconceptual resources nor resources founded in the concrete world will\nenable God to know in advance of his decisions as creator which\ncounterfactuals of freedom are true. If there is a third resource, no\none has said what it is. Thus, while God may firmly believe certain\nsubjunctives of freedom, there appears to be no justification\navailable to him that would allow such beliefs to constitute middle\n knowledge.[6]\n\nNote that the above objection is not based on the claim some have\nmade, that subjunctives of freedom lack truth values, or that their\ntruth is not properly grounded (R.M. Adams 1977; Hasker 1989). That\nmay indeed be a problem for some subjunctives of freedom, but it is\nnot a problem for C\u00a0>\u00a0p. On the usual\nunderstanding, a subjunctive of freedom counts as true provided that,\namong worlds in which its antecedent is satisfied, there is at least\none in which the consequent is satisfied as well, and which is more\nsimilar to our world than any in which the consequent is not\nsatisfied. Now no world can be as similar to the actual world as that\nworld is to itself, and we are assuming that C and p\nare true in the actual world. Accordingly,\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p must be true as well. The only\nway to avoid this outcome is to deny that propositions like p\n\u2014 that is, propositions which describe future free decisions in\nthe actual world \u2014 have truth values, and we have already seen\nthat this will not do. So C\u00a0>\u00a0p is\nperfectly well grounded. The problem is only that it is not grounded\nin the way it needs to be to serve as middle knowledge. It is not\ngrounded independently of God\u2019s or my free decisions.\nIn light of this, we can only conclude that the Molinist effort to\nreconcile creaturely freedom with God\u2019s omniscience and\nsovereignty as creator fails. We have yet to see how God can know as\ncreator what decisions and actions his creatures will engage in, while\nat the same time upholding the idea that those decisions and actions\nare manifestations of libertarian freedom.\n\nThe objections to Molinism presented in the last two paragraphs are\ntypical of most objections to Molinism in that they focus on the key\nidea of the subjunctive of freedom, also often called a counterfactual\nof creaturely freedom (CCF). Ken Perszyk, in his survey of the debate\nover Molinism, divides those objections up into three categories: (1)\narguments that there can be no true CCFs, or at least not enough true\nCCFs for Molinist purposes, (2) arguments that there cannot be true\nCCFs prior to God\u2019s creative decisions, and (3) the argument\nthat we have seen already, that God cannot know CCFs prior to his\ncreative decisions. See Perszyk 2013 for a more thorough discussion of\nthe varieties of such arguments.\n5. An Epistemic Alternative\n\nIt is commonly supposed that Molinism represents the only middle\nground between, on the one hand, a risk-taking God of the sort\nenvisioned by both open theism and simple foreknowledge views (like\nthe Boethian view described above) according to which whatever\nforeknowledge God does have is not of much (or any) providential use,\nand, on the other hand, full-blown theological determinism. It has\nbeen suggested recently (in Kvanvig 2011, chapter 8), however, that\nthere may be space for views other than Molinism in the area between\nthose two extremes. Molinist \u201cmiddle knowledge\u201d is\nknowledge of subjunctive conditionals (\u201cwere Jeff to be put in\ncircumstances C, he would do X\u201d), which God then employs to\nguide his decisions as to what circumstances to actualize. But there\nare a number of other sorts of conditionals that might be of use to\nGod in his decision-making. One is a particular type of indicative\nconditional, an epistemic conditional: \u201cif Booth didn\u2019t\nkill Lincoln, someone else did.\u201d This is a different sort of\nconditional than the subjunctive, for it is true while the\ncorresponding subjunctive (\u201cif Booth hadn\u2019t killed\nLincoln, someone else would have\u201d) is false. An epistemic\nconditional is true when knowing the antecedent puts one in a position\nto know the consequent, such that one\u2019s belief in the consequent\n(on the basis of the antecedent) will count as knowledge so long as\nthe consequent is true and the evidence is undefeated (by contrary\nevidence one has or by external pieces of information that result in a\nGettier situation).\n\nIf Molinist subjunctive conditionals are replaced by these epistemic\nconditionals, a different, \u201cepistemic\u201d theory of creation\nand providence may be generated. God reasons suppositionally: suppose\nI do X, what am I in a position to know would result? He uses his\nknowledge of the epistemic conditionals to infer what he can, and then\nsupposes further actions on his part, inferring further information.\nImportantly, some of these conditionals will describe human free\ndecisions, for even on libertarian views of the will it is still\npossible sometimes to know what someone will freely do on the basis of\nother information about them. Sometimes God will come to a point where\nhe cannot infer anything further because there just isn\u2019t enough\ninformation, but sometimes he will be able to generate a complete\nhistory of the world in this manner, a complete plan or story of the\nworld. Such complete plans or stories are the possible worlds that he\nwill be able to ensure actually come about (by actualizing all the\nstates of affairs he had supposed throughout the reasoning process);\nthey are the feasible worlds on this account of providence. So, like\nMolinism, there are possible worlds that God cannot bring about, but\n(also like Molinism) he has quite a bit more control over the ones he\ncan bring about than is allowed by open theism. The limitations on God\nare subtly different on this view than on Molinism. On Molinism the\nlimitations are the simple facts about what free beings would do in\nany given situation, while on the epistemic account the limitations\nare the availability of evidence with respect to what free beings will\ndo in any given situation.\n\nPerhaps the greatest strength of the epistemic account is that it may\navoid the central problem of Molinism: the question of how the\nconditionals in question can be grounded, and grounded in such a way\nthat God can know them independently of his decision to create. If\nepistemic principles are necessary truths, then God can know a host of\nepistemic conditionals simply on the basis of his knowledge of\nnecessary truths. One problem with the epistemic account is simply the\nquestion of whether there really are sufficient true epistemic\nconditionals for God to come to know enough about what free beings\nwill do with their freedom to generate a whole history of the world.\nPerhaps the profoundest problem for this view, however, is the\nquestion of the infallibility of divine foreknowledge. It is a key\nfeature of the view that the reasoning from antecedent to consequent\nlicensed by the epistemic conditionals is the sort involved in\nordinary judgments of knowledge, and so is defeasible (subject to\noverturning by further information) and fallible. But surely\nGod\u2019s knowledge cannot be defeasible and fallible.\nKvanvig\u2019s solution to this problem is to argue that once the\ndivine course of suppositional reasoning reaches completion and\ndescribes a full possible world, it transforms from fallible and\ndefeasible to infallible and indefeasible precisely because of its\ncompleteness; there are no further pieces of information that God\ncould learn which would undermine the reasoning (an internal defeater)\nor put God into a Gettier situation (an external defeater). But it is\nhard to intuitively reconcile Kvanvig\u2019s solution here with the\nreality that all of this reasoning is merely suppositional and each\nstep on its own is fallible; couldn\u2019t it turn out to be mistaken\nat some point once the suppositions are made reality and the divine\nfallible reasoning collides with what actually happens? (See Kvanvig\n2011 and Hasker 2016 for discussion of these objections.)\n6. The Traditional Solution\n\nIf the views considered thus far all fail, theists have no choice but\nto place the decisions and willings of rational creatures under\nGod\u2019s creative authority. Only by so doing is it possible to\nrestore to him complete control over the course of events in the\nworld, and only in this way can he know as creator what world\nhe is creating, and so be omniscient. If all of our decisions and\nactions occur by God\u2019s creative decree, then all possible worlds\nare made feasible for him. He can create as he wishes, with full\nassurance as to the outcome. And he can know how things will go, in\nparticular how we will decide and act, simply by knowing his own\nintentions as to what our decisions and actions will be. Clearly,\nthere are respects in which this approach is to be preferred. From the\nperspective of piety, the versions of the free will defense we have\nseen so far are all troublesome: they seem to place our concern for\nourselves above our regard for God, by maximizing our options at the\nexpense of his. One can readily anticipate the response that if\ncomplete sovereignty for God and libertarian freedom for his creatures\ncannot both be had, then the devout (not to say Godfearing)\nphilosopher would be well served to endorse the former, that anything\nless is not just out of keeping with the mainstream of theological\ntradition, but actually borders on blasphemy. Yet we have seen that\nfree creatures are of greater value than the unfree, if only because\ntheir greater likeness to God makes them a desirable enhancement to\ncreation. The question, then, is whether placing our decisions and\nactions under God\u2019s creative fiat leaves in place\nanything of creaturely freedom, or of the free will defense.\n\nIt may seem obvious that neither can survive: that once the operations\nof creaturely wills are subordinated to God\u2019s will, libertarian\nfreedom disappears, and with it any hope of absolving God of moral\nevil. But at least where freedom is concerned, traditional theology\nasserts the opposite. Augustine, for example, held that God moves our\nwills, working in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure, as\nscripture says (Phil. 2:13). Yet he insists that this does not\ndiminish our freedom, for if it did we would not be told in the same\npassage to work out our salvation in fear and trembling (On Grace\nand Free Will, 750). Similarly, Thomas Aquinas maintains that all\nof our doings, even those in which we sin, are on a par with the rest\nof creation in having God as their first cause. Only the defect of\nthose actions which is their sinfulness derives from us. Sin, he says,\nis like limping, in which the defective motion arises from the\ncrookedness of the limb, rather than the power of locomotion that\nimpels it (Summa Theologica I-II, Q. 79, Art 2). Like\nAugustine, moreover, Aquinas sees no conflict between God\u2019s\nactivity as creator and ours as free creatures. On the contrary: he\nholds that God\u2019s activity as first cause is actually the cause\nof our freedom, since he moves us in accordance with our voluntary\nnature (Summa Theologica I-II, Q. 18, Art 1, ad 3).\nWhat to make of these suggestions is, however, less than clear. In\nAugustine\u2019s case it may be argued that his later writings\nabandon any earlier flirtation with libertarian ideas, so that the\nnotion of freedom endorsed in the passage referrred to above is in\nfact a version of what today is known as compatibilism (Baker 2003).\nWith Aquinas, however, the situation is less clear (Stump 2003, ch.\n9). Much turns on how it might be possible for God to move us in a way\nthat is truly consistent with our voluntary nature, where\n\u201cvoluntary is taken to signify libertarian freedom\u201d. And\nit has to be said that Aquinas offers little by way of explanation.\nThere is, however, an interesting suggestion in the Summa Contra\nGentiles, where Thomas maintains that if the will were moved by\nan external principle as agent, the movement would be violent, and\nthen proceeds to the conclusion that God alone is able to\nmove the creaturely will as agent without violence, since he alone is\nthe cause and sustainer of its being, and thus is able to move it from\nwithin (Book III, Ch. 88).\n\nThere are two things that may be said in favor of this suggestion here\n(see also McCann 1995 and 2005, Shanley 1998, and Grant 2010 and\n2017). The first concerns libertarian free agency itself, which is\noften portrayed as a power by which we cause, or confer existence\nupon, our own actions. Such a view would not accord with\nAquinas\u2019s claim that only God can move the creaturely will in\nthis way, and in fact it is hard to see how this portrayal of agency\ncan be right. If I confer existence on my decision to attend the\nconcert tonight, I must do so either through some act separate from\nthe decision, or as an aspect of the decision itself. If it is through\na separate act, the problem of freedom simply shifts its location. We\nhave to be convinced that this act in turn receives its existence from\nme, and we appear headed for a vicious regress. But neither does it\nseem possible for me to confer existence on my act of deciding as an\naspect of the act itself. For prior to the act\u2019s appearance\nthere is nothing to do the conferring, and once it appears, the\nconferral is no longer needed. So whatever agency and voluntariness\nconsist in, it does not appear to be an ability to confer existence on\nour own actions. That is important, because it means that unless we\ncan find a way to ground libertarian freedom in the creative activity\nof God, the decisions and actions in which it is manifested are likely\nto have no cause, no accounting whatever \u2014 a situation\nfew philosophers are likely to find satisfying, and which hardly puts\nme in control of my act of\n deciding.[7]\n\nA second important consideration has to do with the relationship\nbetween God\u2019s creative will and the things he creates. We are\nprone to think of this as an event-causal relation, in which God\nissues a kind of command, and the command in turn produces the\nmandated effect. Applied to our example, this would mean that God\ncreatively wills that I decide to attend the concert, and his willing\nthen causes me to decide. And of course this sounds exactly like what\nAquinas describes as the violent operation of an external principle.\nOn this scenario my deciding is passive, and hence involuntary,\nbecause God\u2019s creative fiat is an event independent of\nmy decision, which by acting upon me robs me of my autonomy. I am\nreduced to a puppet manipulated by God, rather than a free agent.\nClearly, however, this scenario does not reflect the way Aquinas\nthinks creation works, and on that score there is reason to think\nAquinas is right. For consider again the causal relation alleged to\nobtain between God\u2019s willing and mine. Whatever we take this to\nconsist in, it must exist contingently, for causal connections are not\nnecessary beings. But then this supposed causal connection must also\nbe created by God, and if that occurs through another process of\ncommand and causation, we would be facing another regress. The only\nway out is to hold that God directly creates the causal nexus\n\u2014 which is to say that in its creation, the nexus itself, not\nsome command, is the first manifestation of God\u2019s\ncreative activity. But if God\u2019s creative will can be directly\nefficacious in this task, then it can also be so in his creation of us\nand our actions. There is, then, no need for a nexus to explain the\nefficacy of God\u2019s creative will, nor is there any causal\ndistance whatever between God and either us or our behavior. Rather,\nwe and all that we do have our being in God, and the first\nmanifestation of his creative activity regarding our decisions and\nactions is nothing short of the acts themselves. This is why it may be\nmisleading to call this traditional view by its common name,\n\u201ctheological determinism,\u201d because the sort of\ndetermination involved in God\u2019s providential ordering of\ncreation is very different than ordinary causal determination within\nthe created order.\n\nA useful analogy that may be drawn here is to the relationship between\nthe author of a story, and the characters within it. The author does\nnot enter into the story herself, nor does she act upon the\ncharacters in such a way as to force them to do the things they do.\nRather, she creates them in their doings, so that they are\nable to behave freely in the world of the novel. On the traditional\naccount, God\u2019s relation to his creatures is similar. As creator,\nhe is the \u201cfirst cause\u201d of us and of our actions, but his\ncausality works in such a way that we are not acted upon, and\nso are able to exercise our wills freely in deciding and acting. If\nthis is correct, then as Aquinas at least seems to suggest,\nGod\u2019s creative activity does not violate libertarian freedom,\nfor it does not count as an independent determining condition of\ncreaturely decision and action. On the contrary: assuming God\u2019s\nown will is free, there is no event in heaven or earth that is\nindependent of my deciding to attend the concert tonight, and which\ncauses my decision. God\u2019s creative activity does not act upon me\nor render me passive in any way, for it consists solely in God\u2019s\nfreely giving himself over to being the ground of being for\nme and all that I do. Accordingly, I can still display libertarian\nfreedom. My decision is a spontaneous display of creaturely agency,\nfree in the libertarian sense because it does not occur through event\ncausality, and because in it I am fully and intentionally committed\nboth to deciding and to deciding exactly as I do. There are no further\nlegitimate requirements for libertarian freedom. There is, of course,\nsomething that cannot happen on this view: it is not possible for\nGod\u2019s activity as creator to be devoted to my deciding to attend\nthe concert, and yet that I should forebear to decide at all, or\ndecide to do something else. But that is not because if I were to try\nit, I would find myself in a losing battle with God\u2019s\nefficacious will. It is because there is no manifestation of that will\nregarding my decision short of the decision itself. The impossibility\nthat God\u2019s will as creator and mine as creature should diverge\nsuggests trouble because we can view what goes on either from\nGod\u2019s perspective or from mine. That suggests two events, and a\npotential conflict between them. Properly interpreted, however, the\ntraditional view appears to call for only one event, and as far as\nit is concerned, all the impossibility comes to is that I\ncannot at once both make a decision and not make it. To be incapable\nof the logically impossible is not a failure of freedom, libertarian\nor otherwise.\n\nSo far it has been argued that theological determinism, by virtue of\nthe nature of the determination involved (which may yield the result\nthat it is even misleading to describe it as determination at all),\nmay well be compatible with a basically libertarian view of free will.\nAn alternative for proponents of theological determinism is to accept\na classically compatibilist view of free will, according to which\nfreedom is compatible even with determination by causal factors within\nthe created order, so long as those causal factors are of the right\nsort. The most famous proponent of such a view is Jonathan Edwards,\nand such views are common in the contemporary free will literature.\nThis discussion will proceed by focusing on the libertarian view of\nthe will, but many of the same approaches can be taken by the\ncompatibilist as well.\n7. Authorship of Sin\n\nThe traditional view is enigmatic, and a lot more would need to be\nsaid to make it convincing. But if an account along these lines can be\nmade to work, creaturely freedom is indeed reconcilable with divine\nsovereignty and omniscience. Our destinies are entirely subordinate to\nGod\u2019s creative will; he exercises full control in all that we\ndo, notwithstanding the fact that our deeds are fully voluntary, and\nwe have every reason to expect that all that takes place in the world\nwill reflect the providence of a perfectly loving father. As for\nomniscience, here too there is no difficulty. God knows about our\ndecisions and actions simply by knowing his own intentions, for he\nwills that they occur. Nor is his will exercised from the fastidious\ndistance preferred by Molinists, in which God creates us knowing what\nwe will do, but has no hand in our actually doing it. Rather, God is\nas much the cause of our sinful actions as of our virtuous ones, or of\nany other event.\n\nYet, Augustine and Aquinas would both insist, he remains perfectly\ngood and absolutely holy, a being deserving of our complete reverence\nand absolute devotion. How might such a thing be possible? Does not\nthe traditional view entail that God is the author of sin in some\nobjectionable way? This objection must be carefully distinguished from\nthe ordinary axiological problem of evil: the question of whether God\nhas sufficiently good reason to allow the evil and suffering which\nexist. The author of sin objection says that the traditional view\ninvolves God too intimately in evil even if he has sufficiently good\nreason for allowing it.\n\nPart of the answer lies in the fact that even if my act of deciding to\ngo to the concert tonight has its existence grounded in God\u2019s\ncreatively willing that I so decide, it is still I who act,\nstill I who decide. God\u2019s willing that I decide as I do does not\nmake my decision God\u2019s. Indeed, if it did, if my decision were\npredicated of God rather than me, his will would fail to achieve its\nobject. But it is not possible for God\u2019s will to be frustrated,\nas long as what he wills is consistent. So regardless of what we may\nthink of the traditional view\u2019s contention that divine\nsovereignty and creaturely freedom are fully compatible, that view\ndoes not take the operations of our will, or the actions founded upon\nthem, away from us. They remain our own. Consequently, any sin they\ninvolve remains ours also. Thus, if I decide sinfully to go to the\nconcert tonight \u2014 if, say, I am neglecting duties I know should\ntake priority \u2014 the sin is mine, not God\u2019s. If he is to be\nfaulted, it must be for some other reason. It should be noted,\nmoreover, that God\u2019s position in this respect is not much\ndifferent from what it is on the Molinist account. True, that view\ntakes certain things out of God\u2019s hands. Whether I would decide\nto go to the concert in the circumstances in which I will find myself\ntonight is not, according to Molinism, up to God. But it is up to him\nwhether I shall be created in those circumstances, and indeed whether\nI shall exist at all. On both views, God knowingly and willingly\ncreates a world in which rational creatures sin. The difference is\nthat on the traditional view God does have complete control: he can\ncreate any possible world, and he is as much involved as creator in\nthose acts in which we sin as he is in any others.\n\nThis is not a complete answer to the author of sin charge, simply\nbecause the author of sin objection is not one objection at all but a\nfamily of objections. It has as many different versions as there are\nobjectionable relations to sin that the traditional view might be\nthought to entail God bears. It might be argued that the traditional\nview entails that God is the cause of sin, or that God intends sin, or\nthat God desires that sin occur, or that God loses his moral standing to blame sinners for their sins, or that God fails to love the damned.\nEach of these charges must be treated individually (for a variety of\nresponses, see the collected essays in Alexander and Johnson 2016; see also Todd 2018 for a discussion of God\u2019s moral standing to blame sinners).\nHere it may suffice to point out that with respect to each individual\ncharge it is not obvious both that theological determinism entails\nthat God bears the property and that God\u2019s bearing the property\nwould be incompatible with divine perfection. For instance, as the\nabove author-storyteller model makes clear, theological determinism\ndoes not entail that God causes evil in the same way that created\nagents cause evil, and if the traditional privation theory of evil is\ntrue, then theological determinism does not entail that God causes\nevil at all (for more discussion of this appeal to the privation theory of evil, see White 2016, Furlong 2019, chapter 4, and Grant 2019, chapter 6). Nor it is clear that, on the correct view of creation,\ntheological determinism entails that God intends any evil at all;\nperhaps God selects the possible world he wishes to create all at\nonce, so to speak, intending only the good aspects of creation and\nmerely foreseeing (as an unintended side effect) all the evil that is\ncaught up with it (White 2016). God may even love the damned and\ndecide to decree their damnation, if there is a sufficiently great\ngood that cannot be brought about without it; a general may,\nconsistent with perfect love, order his son (a captain in his army,\nwhom he loves) to a certain death in defense of a city in order to\nprevent the greater tragedy of the city\u2019s sacking (Johnson\n2016). The question is whether there is such a great good; and this is\nthe ordinary, axiological problem of evil.\n8. Moral Evil and Defeasibility\n\nIf the author of sin objection does not succeed in defeating the\ntraditional view, then what is left is the question of whether God has\nsufficiently good reason for decreeing the evil that exists. The\nstandard free will defense, which works only by diminishing\nGod\u2019s authority and circumscribing his providence, is not\navailable to the theological determinist. Can the theist\u2019s\nresponse to the argument from evil survive the loss of the standard\nfree will defense?\n\nAnother free will defense may yet be available (McCann 2005). (For\nother attempts to modify a variety of free will defenses so as to make\nthem compatible with theological determinism, see Byerly 2017\nand Almeida 2017.) It must be remembered that even though the actions\nof free creatures do not escape providence, such creatures are still\nan enhancement to creation, in that their nature reflects more closely\nwhat we suppose to be God\u2019s own nature. As such, free creatures\nare more suited to the kind of fellowship with God that believers\nunderstand to be their ultimate destiny. It may be, however, that the\nachievement of that destiny inevitably involves sin. In part, this is\nbecause to have free will is to have a nature that is incomplete, in\nthe sense that what we are never fully determines what we shall do.\nRather, we have to complete our own nature, by establishing an\nidentity for ourselves \u2014 that is, by adopting the patterns of\nbehavior and long term objectives that define our lives. And it may be\nthat in so doing we inevitably find ourselves in rebellion against\nGod, simply because as free beings we are apt to assume we can\nestablish our destiny in a way that escapes providence \u2014 that\nis, entirely by our own choice \u2014 and so make that enterprise\ninstead of obedience to God our first priority. Second, it has to be\nremembered that true friendship is always voluntary. If God only\nexacts devotion from us, we are reduced to being his\nsubjects. To be friends with him requires a meaningful and responsible\ndecision on our part to accept the offer of friendship he presents to\nus. But a responsible choice in God\u2019s favor requires that we\nunderstand the alternative \u2014 which is to be at enmity with him.\nAnd there is good reason to think such an understanding requires that\nwe sin. Guilt, remorse, a sense of defilement, and the hopeless\ndesolation of being cut off from God cannot be understood in the\nabstract, because if they are only understood abstractly they are not\nours. Only through experience can we understand what it means\nto be in rebellion against God, and we gain that experience by\nsinning. By turning away from God we realize what it means to be\nalone, and we learn that however successful they may be, our own\nprojects cannot satisfy us. Only then are we in a position to choose\nresponsibly to accept God\u2019s offer of fellowship. Finally, we\nmust remember the simple fact that if we are to experience a\ntransition that ends in our being united to God, that transition can\nonly begin from a place where we are separated from him. It is\nplausible to think, however, that there is no morally neutral ground\nhere: that unless we are within the circle of God\u2019s love, we\nmust be outside it, and that once we choose voluntarily to stand\nalone, we are already in an attitude of hostility toward God. In\nshort, if we are to come to God as voluntary agents, it may well be\nthat we can only approach him from a position of sinfulness.\n\nIf this is correct, there is a great good that God, as a loving\ncreator, is able blamelessly to will for us, but which in its exercise\ninevitably leads us into blameworthiness. That good is our\nautonomy \u2014 the thing that makes us most like God, and is the\nsole means by which we are able to reach friendship with him, but\nwhich can be responsibly exercised to enter that friendship only if\nfirst employed in a conceit of rebellion, wherein we learn our\nlimitations, and come to appreciate the emptiness of a life based on\nsubjective independence. Only thus are we able to reach a position of\nmoral autonomy from which an authentic choice to enter into fellowship\nwith God is possible. Thus, freedom is indeed crucial to moral evil:\nthe implications of libertarian agency are such that its purpose in\nGod\u2019s plan could not be achieved without the occurrence of sin.\nUnlike the standard free will defense, however, this approach does not\nendanger God\u2019s sovereignty or omniscience. As creator, he is\nfully involved in those acts in which we sin, for they can occur only\nthrough his will. But he incurs no blame for them, for they are our\nacts, not his, and although they place us in rebellion against him,\nthey do not put God in rebellion against himself. Indeed, no\nindividual can be in rebellion against his own will. So if the essence\nof sin is rebellion against the will of God, then even though God is\nthe first cause of those acts in which we sin, it is not possible that\nhe himself sin in their occurrence. It is worth noting, too, that the\npresent view makes it possible to explain what, on the standard free\nwill defense, can only be a mystery \u2014 namely, that although all\nof us possess libertarian freedom, and so have the option of serving\nGod, still all humans sin. The reason for this is not that\nGod suffers a terrible run of bad luck in a grand lottery of his own\ninstitution. Rather, it is because only by passing through sin that\nthe saved are able to achieve their destiny. By creating us in our\nsinfulness, God assures that each individual will develop an authentic\nmoral identity, and, if the theistic tradition concerning divine\njustice is correct, prepares each for the eternal recompense\nappropriate to his character.\n\nAn objection may be raised at this point. It is not a part of our\nreligious tradition that all are saved. St. Paul, for example, seems\nclearly to have believed that some, the elect, are destined from the\nbeginning for salvation, and others not\n(Rom. 9:10\u201324), and the same appears true of Jesus\nhimself (Matt. 26:24, Luke 10:20). And it is part of\nstandard theology that, after death, the saved are joined to God in\nthe beatific vision, a state of eternal and indescribable joy. The\nlost fare far worse. They are condemned to the bitter and devastating\nfrustration of permanent separation from their creator, and on many\naccounts to a lot of other miseries as well. Now on the present view,\nGod is as much involved in the rebellion of the reprobate as in the\nconversion of the saved. And one may well wonder what could justify\nthis. Why should a loving God create creatures destined for\ndamnation?\n\nMany have found the idea that some creatures are destined for final\nreprobation troubling, if not downright incompatible with divine\nomnibenevolence (M.M. Adams 1993). One option here is to reject the\nconcept of reprobation, opting instead for one or another form of\nuniversalism \u2014 the view that in the end all are saved,\nor at least that salvation is never completely foreclosed to anyone.\nPerhaps in the end the will of those who would reject God is simply\noverwhelmed, so that they have no choice but to accept him.\nAlternatively, it may be that those who would reject God\u2019s\nfriendship are never able to do so with finality, so that the\nopportunity for salvation is always available to them even if they\nnever opt for it. But universalist views face the twin challenges of\napparent unorthodoxy and of seeming to trivialize earthly moral\nexistence, which most religions treat as of paramount importance. \n\nFor those who find universalism unacceptable the problem is to find\nadequate justification for the idea that some may be irretrievably\nlost. Here it should be pointed out that whatever the sufferings of\nthe lost may be, theologians have always agreed that the greatest evil\nthey sustain is final and irremediable separation from God. Nothing\ncould be worse than to be cut off from the love and friendship of a\nfather whose power extends to every detail of the universe, and who\ninvites us to a share in his very life. But if this is the greatest\nevil of damnation, then no one who ends that way is treated unfairly,\nfor this separation is precisely what one chooses by insisting on a\nlife of rebellion rather than seeking reconciliation with God. Indeed,\nhaving once created beings destined to be lost, it is hard to see how\na loving God could do anything but honor their choice in the matter\n(Kvanvig 1993, ch. 4). What is troubling, rather, is that he should\ncreate such beings at all, much less will their performance of the\nvery actions through which they reject him. It may be argued, however,\nthat even here God\u2019s love is at work. He cannot, of course,\ndirectly intend the rebellion of sinners, nor the destruction of the\nfinally unrepentant. But the lost are full participants in securing\ntheir tragic destiny; and while a life ruined by final rebellion is\nmorally indefensible, it is still morally meaningful. Through their\nactions, the lost carve out for themselves a character which, though\nnot upright, represents a real option for a free creature. Thus, the\nargument runs, to the extent that moral autonomy is a good it can be\nwilled for a creature by God even when it takes this form.\nFurthermore, it is claimed, it is a mistake to think that God is not\nlovingly involved in the lives of the reprobate, or that he would have\nbeen more loving had he not created them. On the contrary: what is\nmeaningless is to suppose that God would have shown greater love\ntoward the lost by omitting them from creation. What is not there\ncannot be loved. Equally, it is meaningless to think the lost would be\nbetter off had they not\n existed.[8]\n What does not exist is neither well nor poorly off, nor anywhere in\nbetween; and it is as good for the reprobate to have life, the\nopportunity for salvation, and an autonomous choice as to whether to\naccept it, as it is for the saved. What is not good for them is the\nuse they make of the opportunity, in choosing to be without God. But\nthat is fully their decision, and its consequences are fully\nearned.\n\nIf the sort of view outlined above is correct, there is ample reason\nfor God to create a universe in which there is moral evil, for only\nthrough the presence of moral evil is it possible for creatures like\nus to develop a legitimate moral identity, and make an informed and\nresponsible choice to accept or reject God\u2019s offer of friendship\nwith us. It is important to see that on such a view, moral evil is not\ntreated as a causal means to the good of our having friendship with\nGod. If that were so, opponents could justly object that God could\nsimply have created us in such friendship from the start, and the\ndefense would fail. Rather, the good on which this kind of theodicy is\nbased is a free and informed choice that can only be made from a\nposition of sinfulness. Rather than constituting a causal\nmeans to our establishing our own stance toward God, sin is\nan indispensable part of the process \u2014 something\nwithout which a legitimate choice for or against God\u2019s\nfriendship is not just causally but conceptually impossible. But that\nis not all. In the case of those who choose in God\u2019s favor, at\nleast, moral evil is defeated in that it is bound up in a\ntotal state of affairs that counts as a far greater good, in which the\nevil is addressed and overcome. The very autonomy that the sinner once\ninsisted upon is surrendered to God, thus becoming the foundation for\na new understanding and a richer relationship, in which one is able to\nact as an informed and wholehearted participant in the divine\nenterprise of working good. Sin does not function as a causal means in\nthis process, nor is it simply overbalanced by some other good with\nwhich it coexists. It encountered and overcome, through the\nprovidential operation of God, as manifested in creaturely\nfreedom.\n\nThe idea that evil is defeasible was developed first by Roderick\nChisholm (1968). It is an especially useful notion for theodicy, in\nthat when evil is defeated, the usual objections to the presence of\nevil in the plan of providence are turned aside. If evil were only a\nmeans to good, and were simply outweighed by the goods to which it\nleads, antitheists could legitimately object that God could have\ncreated a better world simply by omitting the evil and creating those\ngoods outright, or obtaining them through means that were not evil. By\ncontrast, when evil is defeated it is caught up in a larger state of\naffairs that constitutes a far greater good, but not by containing\ncomponents that might have occurred independent of the evil in\nquestion, and simply outweigh it. Rather, the evil is addressed within\nthe larger state of affairs in such a way that it becomes integral to\nthe good through which it is defeated. The defeat of evil is,\nmoreover, an especially impressive sort of good. That Beethoven should\nhave overcome the natural evil of his deafness to write the music he\ndid, for example, strikes us as an amazing good \u2014 one far\ngreater than what would have been accomplished had Beethoven written\nthe same music (assuming that to have been possible) with good\nhearing. Similarly, that moral evil is overcome through the process by\nwhich sinners are brought into a right relationship with God may be\nconsidered a far greater good than would have been accomplished had he\nmade us a community of spiritual lotus eaters, whose relationship to\nhim, if any, was founded on no meaningful decision, but simply upon\nour never having had the experience that would make anything else\npossible. Indeed, given the moral vacuity of such an existence, it is\nnot obvious that such creatures would even be fit for divine\nfriendship, much less able to make the decision through which that\nrelationship is brought to pass.\n\nBut of course the same does not occur in the case of any who might be\nlost. Their rebellion is permanent, and is not overcome through any\naction of theirs. The antitheist may wish to argue that in this case\nit is evil that triumphs over good. The character of the lost is\npermanently corrupted: any virtue that was theirs is turned to\nwrongdoing, and any hope that they might even achieve peace with God,\nmuch less be of useful service to him, comes to nothing. Thus, it\nmight be claimed, the very existence of the reprobate stands as a\ngratuitous and unanswered defilement of creation, in which evil is\nvictorious. Can the theist point to anything that might reverse this\nverdict? One possibility is that God himself could take action\nspecifically aimed at defeating all moral evil. This, of course is the\ndefining theme of Christian soteriology. In that tradition, all sin is\ndefeated through the paramount manifestation of God\u2019s love for\nthe world, the redemptive suffering of Christ, which could not have\noccurred unless there were sin, and which makes possible God\u2019s\noffer of salvation to humankind. Not all sinners may accept the offer,\nbut God is reconciled to all, in the sense that the substitutionary\natonement of Christ covers all wrongfulness. For the Christian\nbeliever this is a sine qua non: nothing but the sacrifice of\na being who participates fully in the divine nature is sufficient to\nsatisfy fully the demand of divine justice, and unless that demand is\nsatisfied friendship between God and humankind is impossible. Thus the\nredemptive suffering of Christ is for Christians the ultimate act of\nmercy and compassion on God\u2019s part toward all sinners, and the\nultimate defeat of moral evil (see Plantinga 2004).\n\nThis kind of answer is, however, confined to a particular religious\ntradition. Is a more general solution possible? There are at least two\nlines of response the theist can take up at this point. First, he can\nargue that the moral evil wrought by unrepentant sinners is defeated\nthrough divine justice. Evildoers who refuse reconciliation with God\nreceive a recompense addressed precisely to their offense: a permanent\nstate of separation from the God they reject. The destruction this\nentails befits their situation, but it is also a destruction the\nwrongdoer chooses, and his choice is honored by God in the outcome.\nThus, religious apologists argue, the fate of the reprobate is a\nmanifestation not only of God\u2019s love for them, but also of his\njustice. Without sin, it is held, much of God\u2019s goodness could\nbe displayed in the world, but his justice could not. Not that God\ndoes not forgive the unrepentant; he does, but his forgiveness is\nrejected, and that is what seals the sinner\u2019s fate. So while the\nsinfulness of the unrepentant is not overcome through their accepting\nsalvation, it is defeated through God\u2019s justice in honoring\ntheir rebellion. This display of God\u2019s character is what some\nhave identified as \u201cglory,\u201d and so this is a version of\nthe divine glory defense (see Johnson 2016; for another version of the\ndivine glory defense, see Green 2016 and Hart 2016.) Secondly, there\nis the fact that the sinner\u2019s deeds are visited upon others in\nthe world, who must cope not only with the suffering and hardship that\nresults, but also with the very fact of sin: with knowing they have\nbeen denied the dignity appropriate to rational beings, and instead\nmade the object of malice. Here too, the theist might argue, it is\npossible for sin to be defeated, by being pointed out and corrected,\nand above all by being forgiven. In admonishing and forgiving those\nwho sin toward us, we ally ourselves with God in the struggle against\nmoral evil, by refusing to lapse into vengefulness and self-pity, and\ninstead focusing ourselves, and if possible the sinner as well, on the\nhigher things of God. This also is a good to which sin is integral,\nrather than constituting a mere causal means, and which makes the\nworld far better than it would be if sin never occurred.\n9. Suffering\n\nThe position outlined above depends heavily on the idea that in the\nplan of providence moral evil is defeated, rather than simply being\noutweighed by some good to which it is a means. The evil of sinful\nwilling is overcome when autonomy that is wrongfully exercised is\nsurrendered to God in repentance and conversion, or when the sinner is\nleft to the just deserts of willing to be separated from God. It may\nfairly be argued, however, that the defeat here pertains primarily to\nintrinsic moral evil \u2014 that is, to sinful willing itself \u2014\nrather than to the harm caused by it. Both conversion and reprobation\nmay refute the sinful will, but they do not seem to alleviate or\notherwise overcome the suffering caused by it. The idea of forgiveness\nmay address the latter to some extent, but it is not entirely clear\nhow. And even so, it may be claimed, much suffering is not, or at\nleast not obviously, the result of wrongdoing. The pains and anxieties\nof daily living would doubtless be lessened if wrongful willing did\nnot occur, but there would still be danger and disease, accidents,\nnatural disasters, occasional deprivation, the sufferings of old age,\nand eventual death. Theodicy has to deal with these evils too, and as\nin the case of sin, it will not do to claim simply that they lead to\nsome greater good that outweighs them. For as in the case of sin, the\nantitheist could then argue that God could as easily have created the\nworld so that the resultant good would be achieved by means that did\nnot involve suffering, or would simply appear without any means at\nall. How, then, might the theist respond here? Can the concept of\ndefeasibility be developed so as to cover suffering as well as\nsin?\n\nOne indication that it can is the disdain we would have for a world in\nwhich there were no suffering or hardship to be faced, but instead\nonly endless gratification. As usually formulated, the argument from\nevil is based on what appears to be a false presumption. It imagines\nthat the ideal world for a loving and compassionate God to create must\nbe what John Hick describes as a hedonistic paradise: a place devoted\nto human enjoyment, in which comfort and convenience are maximized,\nand pain and deprivation have little or no place (1966, 292\u201393).\nIf not banished completely, they must be held to the minimum necessary\nto guarantee to God\u2019s creatures the most pleasant existence\npossible. Now obviously, that is not the sort of world we have. The\namount of suffering is immense \u2014 far more, certainly, than it\nwould be if God\u2019s aim were to maximize worldly joy. But the\nappropriate conclusion, the theist may argue, is not that the universe\nis not the creation of a provident God. For consider how we react to\npeople whose lives have little to distinguish them except that they\nappear \u2014 perhaps deceptively \u2014 to be filled with\nenjoyment. There is a tendency, when we suffer one or another of\nlife\u2019s ills, to envy such people: to wish our own existence\ncould be as theirs seems to be, rather than the painful drudgery of\nthe moment. But the truth is that we seldom admire those who appear to\nhave a life of ease, nor are we likely to consider that kind of life\nvery well spent. What we admire are lives of courage and sacrifice:\npersons who overcome hardship, deprivation, or weakness to achieve\nsome notable success; who stand, perhaps not even successfully,\nagainst some great evil; or who relinquish their own happiness to\nalleviate the suffering of others. How would such lives be possible if\nnatural evil did not exist? (For a related view, see Swinburne\n1978.)\n\nStill less would we respect an entire world devoted to nothing but\nenjoyment. Imagine a society in which everyone has an electrode\nimplanted in their brain, which, when a current is passed through it,\ncauses intense euphoria, unmatched by any other pleasure. One simply\nneeds to be attached to a power source, and the simple push of a\nbutton yields ecstasy. And that is all anyone cares about.\nAgriculture, commerce, government, and social institutions are\norganized toward but one goal: to maximize the time each person can\nspend plugged in, lost in self-stimulation. Individual lives are\nconducted with the same aim. Work is still necessary, but it is held\nto a minimum, and contact with fellow human beings has no purpose\nother than to keep things running smoothly, so that the pleasure of\nall can be maximized. Now if the antitheist ideal of creation were\ncorrect, this type of society ought to represent a high order of human\nexistence \u2014 better by far than the world in which we presently\nfind ourselves. In fact, however, it is beneath contempt, a level of\nexistence so low as to be barely human. The enterprises we value most\nwould shrivel to near nothingness in such a world: there would be no\nart or culture, no important public works, little technology and\nscience \u2014 above all, no real human fellowship, no caring, no\nsacrifice (Hick 1966, 359\u201361). Perversely enough, in fact, all\nwe have to add to a world like this is war, and we get a situation not\nat all unlike Hobbes\u2019s state of nature, the very antithesis of\nanything we could value. Clearly, says the theist, we wish more for\nourselves than this. A life without challenge is a life without\ninterest.\n\nIf theism is correct on these matters, then a God interested in\ncreating the best of worlds cannot have as his top priority the\nmaximization of creaturely pleasure. Rather, a significant part of the\nenterprise of creation itself ought to be the confrontation and defeat\nof evil \u2014 an accomplishment far greater than merely guaranteeing\nthe unperturbed pleasure of all. And if human beings are created in\nGod\u2019s image, and called to friendship with him, it is to be\nexpected that they will have an important share in this enterprise.\nThe central role in every human life of the struggle against evil\nbears this out. The battle is fought within each of us: the foremost\nchallenge we face is that posed by our own sinfulness, which is\novercome when we acknowledge that control of our destiny lies finally\nwith God, and give up our false claim to ourselves. But for believers\nthat is by no means the end of the matter. In the wake of repentance\nthere should occur a gradual transformation of the individual, in\nwhich the damage wrought by sin is repaired, and the character traits\nappropriate for friendship with God are nourished. Remorse, anger and\nbitterness have to be replaced by gratitude, peace and hope; attitudes\nof failure must be supplanted by a sense of worth; rationalization has\nto give way to self-understanding. Above all, the believer has to\ndevelop such virtues as humility, patience, courage, and concern for\nothers \u2014 to give up selfishness in favor of charity. Hick calls\nthis process \u201csoul-making\u201d (1966, 289-97) In it, the\nindividual is transformed into a being suited for full friendship with\nGod, because through the achievement of virtue he is made over into\nGod\u2019s likeness. And much of the process takes place through our\nlearning to deal with natural evil, with pain, sorrow and deprivation,\nin ourselves and others. By having to cope with our own suffering, we\ndevelop peace, humility, perseverance, and trust in God. We also learn\nsympathy for others who suffer, and by working to improve their lot we\nestablish mercy and justice, in ourselves and in society. Indeed, much\nof human fellowship and solidarity is founded upon the support and\ncomfort we lend to each other in times of need, and in the common\nenterprises by which we seek to secure ourselves and one another\nagainst the depredations of natural evil.\n\nAccording to soul-making theodicy, then, by undergoing the soul-making\nprocess we develop the traits required for true friendship with God,\nin the only way that is suitable for humans. Some might object that\nGod could have created virtuous people without their having to go\nthrough the troubles that afflict our present existence, that\ndispositions to good behavior need not be established through\nsuffering (Mackie 1955, 205\u201306). Theists can respond, though,\nthat this objection fails to grasp the nature of soul-making. Human\nvirtues are not mere behavioral dispositions, of the kind found in the\ninanimate world. There are, no doubt, natural dispositions of\npatience, courage, kindness and the like \u2014 behavioral\npropensities we are born with, and that vary in strength from one\nindividual to another. But these are not what we have in mind when we\nspeak of moral virtue in the proper sense. True virtue has to be\ntested and refined. Someone with the virtue of patience must have\ntasted affliction and disappointment, and seen things through; the\ncourageous person has to have endured danger and risk; the\ncompassionate must have struggled with temptation, sorrow and\nhardship. The point of such experiences is not merely to strengthen\nour tendency to act rightly. Virtue is much more than an abiding\nbehavioral propensity. It is a matter of practical wisdom. It requires\nthat we know trial and suffering, and human weakness in the face of\nthem, in the only way they truly can be known: through experience.\nSuffering, like sin, cannot be understood in the abstract. Only first\nhand awareness of the world\u2019s pain enables us to comprehend\nfully the options for good and ill in the situations we face, to judge\ncorrectly what action is called for, and to perform it with an\nattitude of humble submission to God, and loving concern for others.\nIn short, true virtue requires knowledge of good and evil \u2014 not\njust as they are manifested in our own struggle with sin, but as they\nare played out in the travail of the whole world. As we gain this\nknowledge, we become more suited for God\u2019s friendship; indeed,\nthe process of gaining it is the beginning of the friendship. For to\naddress virtuously the hardships of life is not only to improve\nourselves; it is to take up the role God has planned for us in the\ncrucial creative enterprise of overcoming natural evil.\n\nSoul-making, according to its defenders, is not possible except\nthrough the experience of suffering. Because this is so, and because a\nworld in which humans are brought to spiritual maturity through this\nprocess is incomparably better than a hedonistic paradise, there is\nevery reason to expect that a perfectly good and loving God would\ncreate a world in which there is suffering. Still, the opponent may\nobject that this answer is at best incomplete. For, he will argue, not\nall of the suffering of the world enters into soul-making. Consider\nagain the case that was mentioned earlier, of the fawn caught in a\nforest fire. By and large, the sufferings of lower animals pass\nwithout even being remarked by rational beings, and seem to serve no\npurpose whatever. Even among humans, intense suffering is often\nfollowed simply by death, and contributes to no apparent moral\ndevelopment. Or, it may simply be that a person dies suddenly. What\nend of soul-making does that serve? And in any case, the complaint\ncontinues, surely the sheer amount of natural evil that\nexists in the world is incommensurate with the purposes described. In\nmuch of human pain and hardship we see little or nothing of the\nheroic, but only misery. Virtue is a fine thing, but could not God\nhave contrived to purchase it less expensively?\n\nIt is difficult for the theist to give a fully satisfying answer at\nthis point. Perhaps the best strategy is to invoke again the concept\nof defeasibility. For a theodicy that emphasizes that notion,\nGod\u2019s full purpose in creating a world that includes pain and\naffliction includes more than the spiritual maturation of his\ncreatures. Indeed, that effect is only concomitant to the objective\nthat is first and foremost: that evil be defeated. We should expect,\ntherefore, that evil will be found in the world to such a degree and\nin such variety as best to serve this overarching purpose. If anything\nless were so \u2014 if God, as creator, should shrink from some evil\nas too diabolical to be overcome, or too bitter to be endured \u2014\nhe would already have fled the field, and the battle would be lost\nbefore it had begun. But as to the actual degree and diversity of evil\nnecessary for its defeat, that is very difficult for humans to judge.\nOur perspective on creation is vastly incomplete, and in any case we\nhave no reason to expect to be privy to God\u2019s purposes regarding\neach detail of creation \u2014 especially, as we are about to see,\nwhen it comes to suffering. Still, some helpful points are available\nto the theist.\n\nFirst, as regards the claim that there is too much evil, or that much\nof it serves no purpose, it is not obvious that each instance of\nsuffering must be defeated separately from all others, or in the\nexperience of the individual who endures\n it.[9]\n The death of another can be as much a reminder to me of my finitude\nas my own impending death, sudden or lingering. The sufferings of\nothers \u2014 even of lower animals \u2014 can be effective in\narousing me to works of mercy and charity. Indeed, while particular\nacts of compassion must perforce be directed toward this or that\nspecific instance of suffering, the attitude of compassion is not. Its\nobject is all suffering, even suffering of which none but the\nsufferer will ever be specifically aware; and compassion can be\nawakened and reinforced by the very realization that much suffering\ngoes unnoticed and unrequited. The same goes for other virtues. We may\nbe prompted to greater efforts to secure justice in the world\nprecisely because we know that much injustice is never redressed; we\nmay seek to accomplish some difficult goal for which others suffered\nwithout success, and in whose memory we want to see it attained. One\nof the benefits of evil that seems unrequited, then, is that it\nelicits greater effort to deal with those ills we can address, and\ngreater urgency to assist the forgotten. In this sense, at least,\nthere is no such thing as suffering that serves no purpose.\n\nA second important point concerns the way in which suffering\nis defeated in the process of soul-making. It is not simply that it is\ncaught up in a larger process that is very good. That would be\ncompatible with suffering merely being outweighed in the larger\nprocess, or with it serving only as a causal means to the achievement\nof virtue \u2014 neither of which is enough to secure its defeat.\nRather, suffering is addressed in the process of soul-making and, as\nit were, refuted. To see how this occurs, we need to understand the\nnature of suffering. It is rarely a matter of sheer physical pain, and\neven when it is, we are often quite prepared to bear it. A distance\nrunner might endure a lot of pain, or a student considerable hardship,\nin pursuit of their goals. Yet both might maintain an optimistic\nspirit, and even deny they were really suffering. True suffering\noccurs when reason is left groping, and hope is called into question.\nWe suffer when pain seems too great to bear and to serve no\ncommensurate end: when the loss of a loved one leaves us dazed, empty\nand alone; when hateful assaults leave us feeling wounded and\nviolated; when we are distressed by disease, or the ravages of old\nage. Experiences like these tend to crowd all else out of our\nconsciousness. They make us feel dismayed, vulnerable and incomplete;\nthey make our projects appear trivial, our ambitions unreachable.\nAbove all, the experience undermines our confidence in the essential\ngoodness of the world, and our hope that all will be well. Indeed,\nwhat suffering does is to raise for each of us, in a way mere argument\ncannot, the problem of evil \u2014 and with it the inevitable\ntemptation to sullenness, self-pity, and enmity toward whatever God\nthere may be. But when we face the problem, and work through\nsuffering, it is defeated. The defeat can manifest itself in many\nways. Almost always, our capacity to endure future hardships, and to\ncomfort others in theirs, is increased. We may come to see more\naccurately our place in the universe, to deepen our devotion to God,\nto resolve to assist in attacking the sources of suffering, in human\nwrongdoing as well as the vagaries of nature. In all of this, the\ntheist may argue, natural evil is defeated: the very experience that\nthreatens to overwhelm confidence in the good becomes the\nindispensable foundation for attitudes of character that serve to\ndiminish its effects and aim at wiping it out. Above all, however,\nsuffering is defeated in the simple fact that it is borne with good\ngrace \u2014 that we refuse to submit to the temptation to descend\ninto repining and bitterness, and resolve instead to continue in hope.\nMuch of the heroism of those who suffer lies simply in this: that they\nstrive to go on \u2014 something even a fawn can do.\n\nThe problem of suffering is not just an intellectual challenge, but a\nmoral one as well. Evil calls for a certain reaction on our part, a\nreaction of striving, and it is defeated when that reaction occurs. It\nmade be protested that this reaction is available only to believers,\nand hence that this approach to the problem of evil begs the question.\nThat is not true. The theist is not required to produce a theodicy\nthat will work even if there is no God, only one that will work if\nthere is. And in any case, there seems to be no reason to think\nnonbelievers are precluded from participating in the defeat of evil.\nThey can and do gain from suffering much as believers do \u2014 even\nto the point of reacting to it with hope in the final goodness of\nthings, and with reverence for any source this goodness may have,\nwhatever its nature. It does have to be admitted, of course, that\nparticular instances of pain and misery do not always meet with a\npositive response in the sufferer. There may not be sufficient time,\nand when there is the individual may lack the intelligence or\nunderstanding to react in ways we would recognize. Where we do\nunderstand the reaction, there may be a mix between good and bad\nmanifestations of character. And of course there are cases where\nnatural evil is borne with anything but good will \u2014 with furious\nanger, or morose despair. Faced with this reality, the theist can only\npoint out what was mentioned above, that the evils which befall some\ncan and do work to encourage virtue in others, and this can occur by\nnegative example also. If this seems insufficient, the theist can\nargue that in a world where each an every instance of evil was\nthoroughly and obviously defeated \u2014 so that a perfectly\nsatisfying response to opponents of theism would always be available\n\u2014 an important dimension of evil would be missing. It is\nessential to the challenge of evil that it frequently appears\ngratuitous, that there seems to be too much of it, that as far as we\ncan see, it often goes\n unaddressed.[10]\n Anything less could not bring out the best in us. And then we would\nbe far less suited to God\u2019s friendship, and this world would be\nfar less than is needed for it to be a creation worthy of God: the\nbest of all possible worlds.\n10. Mystery\n\nThe last few sections outlined a variety of approaches to theodicy\nwhich are compatible with theological determinism; they represent\nattempts to explain why God might allow evil which do not rely on the\ntraditional free will defense. Equally prominent in the\ntradition\u2019s treatment of evil, however, is the theme of mystery:\nan unwillingness to identify with any surety why God would allow evil.\nThat theme is prominent in scriptural treatments of evil, such as\nthose found in Job and Ecclesiastes. Perhaps the most plausible way to\ninterpret the tradition\u2019s emphasis on mystery is as a\ncombination of what philosophers now call skeptical theism and the\nMoore Switch.\n\nSkeptical theism\n notes that the basis of the argument from evil is often, perhaps\nalways, an inference from what is not seen, a \u201cnoseeum\u201d\ninference: \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason God could have for\nallowing evil, so there isn\u2019t one.\u201d Sometimes inferences\nof that sort are good ones, as when I infer that there are no\nelephants in the classroom on the basis of the fact that I don\u2019t\nsee any. But often inferences of that sort are fallacious, as when I\ninfer that there are no germs in the room on the basis of the fact\nthat I don\u2019t see any. The difference seems to be, roughly\nspeaking, that I would expect to see any elephants if there were any,\nbut I wouldn\u2019t expect to see the germs. Which are God\u2019s\nreasons most like, the elephants or the germs? Arguably, given the\nepistemic distance between God and man, his reasons would be more like\nthe germs, and so the fact that we can\u2019t identify a reason for\nGod to allow evil doesn\u2019t justify the inference that there is no\nsuch reason. Such, in outline, is the basic idea behind skeptical\ntheism. (See Dougherty and McBrayer 2014 for debate over the\nview.)\n\nThe Moore Switch (Rowe 1979) is a related but different move. If one\ncan know that God exists, and perhaps that Christianity or some other\nreligion is true, on the basis of other evidence, and that evidence is\nsufficiently great so as to overwhelm the evidence against the\nexistence of God provided by the existence of evil, then the problem\nof evil might become simply a puzzle to solve instead of a decisive\nreason against belief in God, even without a full explanation for\nevil. Particularly, if there exists a sort of direct perception of God\nor God\u2019s works or properties of created things that directly\nimply the existence of God, then the evidence provided by such direct\nperception could overwhelm the evidence for the premises of an\nargument from evil against theism. The movement of Reformed\nepistemology has claimed to identify such direct perceptions or\nsomething analogous to such direct perceptions, and as such\nconstitutes a distinct response to the problem of evil that still\namounts to a kind of appeal to, or justification of, mystery with\nrespect to God\u2019s reasons for allowing evil (See Alston 1991 and\nPlantinga 2000).\n11.Conclusion\n\nThe hallmark of the traditional free will defense is its\nfastidiousness: it seeks to distance God from as much evil as\npossible, so that his goodness will not be tainted by it. The God of\nthe Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions is not so fastidious. He is\nactive in all our deeds, turning our hearts where he wills\n(Prov. 21:1), and working in us to will and to do as he\npleases. Part of his purpose in this, the tradition holds, is that we\nbe creatures with the moral authenticity that can only come with free\nwill. The inevitable accompaniment, however, is that we sin. God does\nnot will this for its own sake, but if God\u2019s providence is\ncomplete he does will for us the independence that amounts to our\nrebellion, for it is indispensable to his purpose. The question the\ntradition faces is whether God\u2019s providence can be complete\nhere, whether he can have full sovereignty if we are truly free. The\nsecond focus of concern is the fact of suffering, which also falls\nunder God\u2019s will. According to theodicies that emphasize\nsoul-making and defeasibility, this is not because God is malevolent,\nbut so that we can share with him the knowledge that evil is\ncreation\u2019s enemy, and partake in the glory of its defeat. The\nscriptural God evinces no fear that he will be tainted by any of this,\nnor does he distance himself from evil in any way. On the contrary:\neven after Adam\u2019s sin God remains fully engaged with humankind,\nsparing no effort to secure our rescue, and treating our suffering\nwith healing concern and compassion. In the Christian tradition, he is\neven willing to send his son to bear our sorrows with us, and to be\nsacrificed so that we may again find acceptance with God in\nrepentance. The fallenness of creation is not, then, an object of\nheavenly disdain, and for defenders of divine providence it is not\ncause for philosophical disappointment. Rather, they hold, the task of\novercoming evil is central to the creative enterprise. We sin and\nsuffer because God is out to defeat sin and suffering, and to see that\nall who are ordained to share in the victory do so. The theist is\nforced to admit, however, that we do not always understand in detail\nhow this occurs, and some sort of appeal to mystery may in fact be\nnecessary. In that respect, at least, any theodicy has to be\nincomplete.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Almeida, M., 2017, \u201cCompatibilism and the Free Will\nDefense,\u201d in H.
