    "main_text": "Arguments for Broad Content || Putnam\u2019s Argument: Twin Earth and Natural Kinds\n2.1 Putnam\u2019s Argument: Twin Earth and Natural Kinds\n\nAmong the earliest and most influential arguments for broad content\nwere Hilary Putnam\u2019s arguments in such essays as \u201cThe\nMeaning of \u2018Meaning\u2019\u201d (1975). Putnam\u2019s\narguments were not designed specifically with mental content\nin mind. They applied in the first instance to linguistic\ncontent, more specifically to the reference of terms in a natural\nlanguage. However, they have been widely applied to mental content. I\nwill first discuss Putnam\u2019s argument concerning linguistic\ncontent, and then note how it can be extended to mental content.\n\nPutnam\u2019s most famous examples involve \u201cTwin Earth,\u201d\nan imaginary planet which is molecule-for-molecule identical to Earth,\nincluding having exact duplicates of Earth\u2019s inhabitants,\nexcept for a systematic change in certain parts of the\nnatural environment. In a particularly well-known version of this\nexample, we consider Earth as it was around 1750, before the chemical\nstructure of water was discovered, and we consider an inhabitant of\nEarth named \u201cOscar\u201d who is a competent user of the term\n\u2018water\u2019. We then imagine a Twin Earth which is exactly\nlike Earth in every way, including having an exact duplicate of Oscar,\nwith one exception: for every place on Earth that contains\nH2O, the Twin Earthly duplicate of that place instead\ncontains XYZ, a substance with a different microstructure from water\nbut with similar observable properties. On Twin Earth, it is XYZ, not\nH2O, that falls from the skies and fills the lakes and\noceans.\n\nPutnam argues that the stuff that falls from the skies and fills the\nlakes on Twin Earth is not water. According to Putnam, when\npeople used the term \u2018water\u2019, even in 1750, they intended\nto refer to a natural kind, a kind of thing whose instances\nshare a common nature, not directly observable, which explains the\nobservable properties of instances of the kind. They identified water\nby observable characteristics like colorlessness and odorlessness, but\nthey also assumed that there was a microstructure which explains these\nobservable properties. Since 1750, we have learned what this\nmicrostructure is, namely that water consists of molecules of\nH2O. But water was H2O even in 1750,\nbefore we learned this. (Other natural kind terms work in the same\nway. For instance, we identify diseases by their symptoms, but we\nassume that there is an underlying cause of these symptoms, for\nexample a particular microorganism, and that even before we know what\nthis underlying cause is, it makes the disease what it is.)\n\nNow Twin Oscar, being an exact duplicate of Earth\u2019s Oscar, will\nhave many of the same properties Oscar has. For instance, he will be\ndisposed to accept a sentence of Twin English that is written and\npronounced exactly like the English sentence \u201cWater is\nwet.\u201d However, Putnam argues, Twin Oscar\u2019s word\n\u2018water\u2019 does not refer to water. There\nis no water on Twin Earth, only XYZ; Twin Oscar has never seen water,\ntalked about water, or interacted with water in any way. So it seems\nthat he cannot possibly refer to water.\n\n(Two points should be made parenthetically about this example. (1) The\nobservable properties of XYZ do not need to be identical to\nthose of water; all that is needed is that Oscar and Twin Oscar have\nnot observed the differences. (2) In some ways it is unfortunate that\nthe water/XYZ example has become Putnam\u2019s best known example,\nbecause it has a failing that many of his other examples lack, namely\nthat most of the human body consists of water. This has the\nconsequence that Twin Oscar cannot be an exact duplicate of Oscar\nunless Twin Oscar also consists largely of water. Other examples\nPutnam considers involve switching aluminum and molybdenum, beeches\nand elms, diseases, and so on, and these examples do not suffer from\nthe same problem.)\n\nIt is important for this example that, although 1750 residents of\nEarth did not yet realize this, all water was in fact H2O.\nHad it turned out instead that some of the stuff called\n\u201cwater\u201d was H2O while other stuff called\n\u201cwater\u201d was XYZ, then water would not have turned out to\nbe a single \u201cnatural kind.\u201d In that case the English word\n\u201cwater\u201d would refer to anything that was either\nH2O or XYZ, and we could say that the Earthly and\nTwin-Earthly \u2018water\u2019-words referred to the same thing.\nAgain, if it had turned out that there were a huge number of different\nmicrostructures that produced the observable properties of water, then\nwater would not have been a natural kind at all. In that case we would\nprobably say that anything with the right observable properties was\nwater, and in that case again we could say both\n\u2018water\u2019-words were coreferential. In fact, though, neither\nof these possibilities obtains. Water is a natural kind whose\nessential nature is that it has the chemical structure H2O;\nsince there is no H2O on Twin Earth, there is no water\nthere. Twin Earthlings never had occasion to give a label to water,\nsince there is none on their planet, so their word \u201cwater\u201d\ndoes not refer to water.\n\nSince Oscar and Twin Oscar have exactly the same intrinsic properties,\nyet refer to different substances when they use their\n\u2018water\u2019-words, their intrinsic properties cannot suffice\nto determine what they refer to. If the meaning of a word suffices to\ndetermine its reference, then meaning cannot be determined by\nintrinsic properties either. As Putnam famously puts it,\n\u201c\u2018meanings\u2019 just ain\u2019t in the\nhead!\u201d (1975, p. 227).\n\nAlthough the argument as presented so far concerns the reference of\n\u2018water\u2019 and other natural kind terms, it is natural to\nextend it to mental content as well (McGinn 1977; Burge 1979, note 2).\nNot only does Twin Oscar not refer to water when he uses the term\n\u2018water\u2019, he does not have beliefs about water either. To\nbe sure, he has beliefs that play the same role in his mental life\nthat Oscar\u2019s water-beliefs play in his. But in Twin\nOscar\u2019s case, those beliefs are not about water. In particular,\nwhile Oscar believes that water is wet, Twin Oscar does not. Since\nOscar and Twin Oscar have identical intrinsic properties, yet Oscar\nbelieves that water is wet while Twin Oscar does not, mental content\ncannot be determined solely by intrinsic properties.\n",
