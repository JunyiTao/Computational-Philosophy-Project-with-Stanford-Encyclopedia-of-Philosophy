The Augustinian Understanding of Hell\n\nBehind the Augustinian understanding of hell lies a commitment to a\nretributive theory of punishment, according to which the primary\npurpose of punishment is to satisfy the demands of justice or, as some\nmight say, to balance the scales of justice. And the Augustinian\ncommitment to such a theory is hardly surprising. For based upon his\ninterpretation of various New Testament texts, Augustine insisted that\nhell is a literal lake of fire in which the damned will experience the\nhorror of everlasting torment; they will experience, that is, the\nunbearable physical pain of literally being burned forever. The\nprimary purpose of such unending torment, according to Augustine, is\nnot correction, or deterrence, or even the protection of the innocent;\nnor did he make any claim for it except that it is fully deserved and\ntherefore just. As for how such torment could be even physically\npossible, Augustine insisted further that \u201cby a miracle of their\nmost omnipotent Creator, they [living creatures who are damned] can\nburn without being consumed, and suffer without dying\u201d (City\nof God, Bk. 21, Ch. 9). Such is the metaphysics of hell, as\nAugustine understood it.\n\nIt would be unfair, however, to imply that all Augustinians, as\nclassified above, accept Augustine\u2019s own understanding of an\neternal torture chamber. For many Augustinians view the agony of hell\nas essentially psychological and spiritual in nature, consisting of\nthe knowledge that every possibility for joy and happiness has been\nlost forever. Hell, as they see it, is thus a condition in which\nself-loathing, hatred of others, hopelessness, and infinite despair\nconsumes the soul like a metaphorical fire. Still, virtually all\nAugustinians agree with Jonathan Edwards concerning this: whatever the\nprecise nature of the suffering, \u201cIn hell God manifests his\nbeing and perfections only in hatred and wrath, and hatred without\nlove\u201d (Edwards 1738, 390). In fact, according to Edwards, the\ndamned never were an object of God\u2019s electing love in the first\nplace: \u201cThe saints in glory will know concerning the damned in\nhell, that God never loved them, but that he hates them, and [that\nthey] will be for ever hated of God\u201d (Edwards 1834, sec. III).\nSo why are Christians required to love even those whom God has always\nhated? Because, says Edwards, we have no way of knowing in this life\nwho is, and who is not, an object of God\u2019s eternal hatred.\n\u201cWe ought now to love all, and even wicked men\u201d because\n\u201cwe know not but that God loves them\u201d (sec. III). In the\nnext life, however, \u201cthe heavenly inhabitants will know that\n[the damned] \u2026 are the objects of God\u2019s eternal\nhatred\u201d (sec. II). Edwards and other Augustinians thus hold that\nthe damned differ from the saved in one respect only: even before the\ndamned were born, God had already freely chosen to exclude them from\nthe grace and the redemptive love that God lavishes upon on the\nelect.\n\nSo why, one may wonder at this point, do the Augustinians believe that\nanyone\u2014whether it be Judas Iscariot, Saul of Tarsus, or Adolph\nHitler\u2014actually deserves unending torment as a just recompense\nfor their sins? The typical Augustinian answer appeals to the\nseriousness or the heinous character of even the most minor offense\nagainst God. In Cur Deus Homo (or Why God Became\nMan), a classic statement of the substitution theory of\natonement, St. Anselm illustrated such an appeal with the following\nexample. Suppose that God were to forbid you to look in a certain\ndirection, even though it seemed to you that by doing so you could\npreserve the entire creation from destruction. If you were to disobey\nGod and to look in that forbidden direction, you would sin so gravely,\nAnselm declared, that you could never do anything to pay for that sin\nadequately. As a proponent of the retributive theory, Anselm first\ninsisted that \u201cGod demands satisfaction in proportion to the\nextent of the sin.\u201d He then went on to insist that \u201cyou do\nnot make satisfaction [for any sin] unless you pay something greater\nthan is that for whose sake [namely God\u2019s] you ought not to have\nsinned\u201d (Cur Deus Homo I, Ch. 21). Anselm\u2019s\nargument, then, appears to run as follows: Because God is infinitely\ngreat, the slightest offense against God is also infinitely serious;\nand if an offense is infinitely serious, then no suffering the sinner\nmight endure over a finite period of time could possibly pay for it.\nSo either the sinner does not pay for the sin at all, or the sinner\nmust pay for it by enduring everlasting suffering (or at least a\npermanent loss of happiness).\n\nBut what about those who never commit any offense against God at all,\nsuch as those who die in infancy or those who, because of severe brain\ndamage or some other factor, never develop into minimally rational\nagents? These too, according to Augustine, deserve to be condemned\nalong with the human race as a whole. \u201cFor \u2026 the whole\nhuman race,\u201d he insisted, \u201cwas condemned in its apostate\nhead by a divine judgment so just that even if not a single member of\nthe race [including, therefore, those who die in infancy] were ever\nsaved from it, no one could rail against God\u2019s justice\u201d\n(Enchiridion,\n 99).[3]\n Registering his agreement with Augustine, Calvin likewise wrote:\n\u201cHence, as Augustine says, whether a man is a guilty unbeliever\nor an innocent believer, he begets not innocent but guilty\nchildren, for he begets them from a corrupted nature\u201d (Calvin\n1536, Bk. II, Ch. I, sec. 7 \u2014italics added). Augustine and\nCalvin both believed, then, that God justly condemns some who die in\ninfancy; indeed, if their innocence required that God unite with them,\nthen the ground of their salvation would lie in themselves rather\nthan, as Augustine saw it, in God\u2019s own free decision to save\nthem from their inherited\n guilt.[4]\n With respect to the unborn twins Jacob and Esau, Augustine thus\nwrote: \u201cboth the twins were \u2018by nature children of\nwrath,\u2019 not because of any works of their own, but because they\nwere both bound in the fetters of damnation originally forged by\nAdam\u201d (Enchiridion, 98).\n\nAs these remarks illustrate, the Augustinian understanding of original\nsin implies that we are all born guilty of a heinous sin against God,\nand this inherited guilt relieves God of any responsibility for our\nspiritual welfare. In Augustine\u2019s own words, \u201cNow it is\nclear that the one sin originally inherited, even if it were the\nonly one involved, makes men liable to condemnation\u201d\n(Enchiridion, 50\u2014italics added). Augustine thus\nconcluded that God can freely decide whom to save and whom to damn\nwithout committing any injustice at all. \u201cNow, who but a\nfool,\u201d he declared, \u201cwould think God unfair either when he\nimposes penal judgment on the deserving or when he shows mercy to the\nundeserving\u201d (Enchiridion, 98). For the Augustinians, then, the\nbottom line is that, even as our Creator, God owes us nothing in our\npresent condition because, thanks to original sin, we come into this\nearthly life already deserving nothing but everlasting punishment in\nhell as a just recompense for original sin.\n\nAlthough this Augustinian rationale for the justice of hell has had a\nprofound influence on the Western theological tradition, particularly\nin the past, critics of Augustinian theology, both ancient and\ncontemporary, have raised a number of powerful objections to it.\n",
