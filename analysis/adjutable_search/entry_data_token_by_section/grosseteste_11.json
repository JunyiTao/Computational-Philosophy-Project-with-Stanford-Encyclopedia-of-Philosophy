    "main_text": "Exemplarism, Truth and Illumination || Illumination\n10.3  Illumination\nUnder Augustine\u2019s influence Grosseteste subscribes to an\nilluminationist account of human knowledge, according to which human\nknowledge is understood by analogy to bodily vision: as a body can\nonly be seen if light is shed on it and the eyes, so something can\nonly be known if a spiritual light is shed on it and the mind\u2019s\neye. Grosseteste presents versions of such an account in his\ntreatise On Truth and in his commentary on the Posterior\nAnalytics.\nIn On Truth Grosseteste presents an illuminationist theory\nof knowledge after outlining his theory of truth. Because created\ntruth is a conformity between things and their eternal reasons, we can\nonly know created truth if we know that a created thing conforms to\nits eternal reason in God. But as we can only see a body as colored if\nan external light is shed on its color, rendering it actually visible\nto us, so in order for us to see a created thing as true, an external\nlight must be shed on its truth, rendering it actually visible to\nus. This truth is the adequation of the thing and its eternal reason\nin God\u2019s mind, and thus an external light, the light of the Supreme\nTruth, God, must be shed on both the thing and its eternal reason if\nit is to be visible to the mind. Grosseteste hastens to point out that\nthis doesn\u2019t require that the knower see God himself or even be aware\nof God, for only the pure of heart see God as he is in himself in the\nface-to-face vision of God. All the same, all who know truth must in\nsome way have at least an unwitting cognition of the Supreme Truth and\nits light, and in it a vision of the eternal reasons, that falls short\nof the direct vision of God.\nGrosseteste makes no reference to Aristotle\u2019s views on knowledge\nin On Truth but draws on Augustine and Anselm. But in the\ncommentary on the Posterior Analytics, which appears to be\nthe earlier of the two works, he relates an illuminationist conception\nof knowledge to Aristotle\u2019s account of scientific knowledge. Scholars\ndisagree, however, regarding Grosseteste\u2019s intentions in this\nregard. Some (Gilson 1926\u20137, Lynch 1941, McEvoy 1982) take his\ntreatment of Aristotle\u2019s account of scientific knowledge to accord no\nrole to Aristotle\u2019s notion of abstraction, in whose place Grosseteste\ninstead employs an Augustinian conception of divine\nillumination. Others (Marrone 1983), treating On Truth as the\nearlier work, take Grosseteste now to reject an account of divine\nillumination in our knowledge in this life and hold his references to\nillumination in the context of scientific knowledge to refer to a\nlight the human soul itself sheds on intelligible things in a process\nof abstraction understood along Aristotle\u2019s lines. The truth, however,\nas Van Dyke 2009 argues, seems to be that Grosseteste is concerned to\nsubsume Aristotle\u2019s account of scientific knowledge under a broader\naccount of cognition in which divine illumination plays a crucial role\nin all cognition, while at the same time he endorses the account of\nscientific knowledge and abstraction presented in the Posterior\nAnalytics. The following remarks briefly examine some aspects of\nthis attempt. (For further discussion and more technical aspects of\nGrosseteste\u2019s account of demonstrative science, see the entry on\nMedieval Theories of Demonstration, as well as Crombie 1953, Evans 1983, Laird\n1987, Longeway 2007, McEvoy 1982, Marrone 1983, 1986, Rossi 1995, Serene 1979, Van\nDyke 2009 and 2010, and Wallace 1972.)\nThe Posterior Analytics is concerned to provide an account\nof scientia or \u201cscientific knowledge.\u201d By this is\nmeant not scientific knowledge in the modern sense of a body of theory\nbased on the experimental testing of hypotheses, but rather an\nunderstanding of the reason why a given fact obtains\n(knowledge propter quid), as opposed to knowledge simply that\nthe fact does obtain (knowledge quia), what might be\ndescribed as a certain kind of explanatory knowledge. An Aristotelian\nscience is a systematization of such knowledge based on the structure\nof Euclid\u2019s axiomatic geometry and employing Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic\nlogic. One arrives at scientia of a given fact by deriving it\nas the conclusion of a syllogism whose premises meets certain\nstringent conditions that render them explanatory of that fact. As\nGrosseteste puts it, the premises or principles\u2013i.e., starting\npoints\u2013of such a syllogism must be true, immediate, prior and\nbetter known than the conclusion, must state causes, be necessary,\nconcern essential connections, be universal, everlasting, and\nincorruptible. A syllogism that meets these conditions is called a\ndemonstrative syllogism or demonstration and will provide explanatory\nknowledge of its conclusion. At one point Grosseteste states that only\nmathematics is comprised of demonstrations in this strict sense,\nthough in another passage he suggests that theology would most fully\nmeet these conditions, apparently meaning that the demonstrative\nknowledge possible for us in this life (mathematics) is to be\ndistinguished from that which is possible in the afterlife\n(theology). The sciences of natural phenomena do not, Grosseteste\nclaims, fully meet the requirements for a fully demonstrative science,\nthough if we relax the conditions governing demonstrations somewhat we\nmay speak of a demonstrative science of natural phenomena (see the\nentry on Medieval Theories of Demonstration for details).\nAccording to Grosseteste, the Posterior Analytics is not\nconcerned to provide a method for arriving at demonstrations but\nrather to provide criteria to evaluate whether a given syllogism\ncounts as a demonstration. Nevertheless, Aristotle does discuss the\nsource of the principles and definitions employed in demonstrations,\nand it is in considering these remarks, in particular, that\nGrosseteste introduces the ideas of mental vision and the illumination\nof the mind.\nAccording to Aristotle, it is from sense experience that we obtain\nthe universal concepts and principles of a science. Thus, if someone\nlacks a sense, he will also lack the scientific knowledge involving\nthe concepts and principles derived from exercise of that sense. But\nGrosseteste holds that God and the intelligences (i.e., angels) know\nwithout reliance on the senses, and the intellective power, the\nhighest part of the human soul, relies on no bodily sense or organ in\nits proper operation. Instead, its proper operation involves a mental\nvision in which one arrives at knowledge of things by viewing their\nexemplar forms or reasons in an irradiation received from God or an\nintelligence.\nGrosseteste reconciles this doctrine with Aristotle\u2019s teachings by\nholding that with rare exceptions most individuals in the present life\ndo not have knowledge of this sort; their intellective power is\n\u201csick\u201d and unable to perform its proper operation. In the\npresent life the highest form of knowledge possible for most human\nbeings is Aristotelian demonstrative science, and for this sense\nexperience is indeed required.\nThis might suggest that Grosseteste reserves the notion of mental\nillumination simply for the proper operation of the intellective part\nof the soul. But this is not so. Mental vision and an illumination of\nthe mind are involved even in the operation of our rational power in\ndemonstrative science.\nAlluding to Wisdom 9: 15, Grosseteste holds the\nintellective power is sick because it is darkened and weighed down by\nthe corrupt body. He intimates that human beings are born in this\ncondition, presumably as a consequence of the fall. He likens this\ndarkening of the mind to a cloudy day: as bodily vision is darkened by\nclouds, so the operation of the cognitive powers is darkened by bodily\nappearances (phantasmata), which obstruct our mental vision\nand render it unable to see intelligible items in their purity. This\ndarkening of the mind, Grosseteste holds, is the source of all\nerror. In grasping the principles of demonstration, reason is\nstimulated to leave this darkness. In a newborn human being the powers\nof the rational soul are as if asleep and unable to act. But sense\nexperience in some way involves reason, and through repeated sense\nexperience reason is woken up and carried by the senses to perceptible\nthings. Reason then begins to distinguish and view apart the features\nconfused in sense experience, thereby formulating universal\nconcepts. Repeated experience of correlated perceptible phenomena\nleads the senses to estimate an imperceptible relationship between\nthem\u2014a causal connection, for example. This too awakens reason\nand leads it to wonder whether this connection in fact\nobtains. Grosseteste uses an example, drawn from Avicenna, of the\nclaim that scammony of itself causes the discharge of red\nbile. Wondering whether this is true, we set up what we should now\ncall a controlled experiment in which we exclude other known causes of\nthe discharge of red bile and give someone scammony to see what will\nhappen. And in this way, Grosseteste writes, we arrive \u201cfrom\nsense at an observational (experimentale) universal\nprinciple\u201d (Rossi 1981, 215).\nGrosseteste describes this as the process in which the mind is\nstimulated on the occasion of sense experience to seek and find its\nown light\u2014to turn from corruptible corporeal objects to\nintelligible things. The mind moves out of the darkness it is in to\nfind a trace of its light, which stands to it as the sun stands to the\neyes in bodily vision. As he puts it in discussing certainty,\n\u201cthere is a spiritual light shed on intelligible things and the\nmind\u2019s eye, and this light is related to the inner eye and\nintelligible things in the way the bodily sun is related to bodily\neyes and visible bodily things\u201d (Rossi 1981,\n240\u2013241). Understanding (intellectus) and demonstrative\nknowledge are \u201clike the vision of healthy eyes through the\nmedium of pure air with clear light spread over the colored\nobject\u2026Understanding and demonstrative knowledge apprehend\nthings in the purity of their essence, as they are in\nthemselves\u201d (Rossi 1981, 279\u2013280).\nThese remarks indicate that for Grosseteste some sort of spiritual\nlight and vision is involved in scientific knowledge, but they also\nstrongly suggest that Grosseteste is wedded to an Aristotelian account\nin which the human mind abstracts intelligible items from the data of\nsense. These intelligible items would appear to be the genera and\nspecies of created things, viewed as immanent Aristotelian universals,\nthe second lowest level of a hierarchy of universals Grosseteste sets\nout in the commentary, the highest being the reasons of things in the\ndivine mind. But what exactly is the nature of the vision and\nillumination involved in scientific knowledge? In particular, in his\naccount of demonstrative science, and thus of the sort of knowledge\npossible for most of us in this life, is Grosseteste employing a\nnotion of divine illumination, as he clearly does in his\ntreatise On Truth?\nMarrone 1983, ch. 6, suggests he is not: the light Grosseteste\nmentions is a light, he thinks, that the mind itself sheds on items to\nrender them intelligible and the notions of light and vision play no\nessential role in Grosseteste\u2019s understanding of Aristotelian science:\nthe commentary displays a movement away from the conception of\nknowledge in On Truth in terms of divine illumination towards\na purely naturalistic conception of knowledge. But this view\npresupposes the implausible chronology according to which On\nTruth was written before the commentary and, as van Dyke 2009\npoints out, fits poorly with Grosseteste\u2019s analogy between the light\ninvolved in scientific knowledge and the light shed by the sun in\nbodily vision, which comes from a source apart from the\nsenses. So too, it seems, the light involved in scientific knowledge\nis a light that a source apart from the mind, namely God (or possibly\nan intelligence), sheds on objects of scientific knowledge so as to\nrender them actually intelligible, in the way the light the sun sheds\non bodies makes them actually visible. \n",
