This attention has yet to yield a settled\nconsensus about the merits or the meaning of Berlin\u2019s work\n\u2013 and not only because Berlin evokes strong personal reactions,\nattracting admiration and affection, if not outright veneration as a\nliberal saint (see e.g. Annan 1980, 1990, 1999; Hausheer 1979 and\n2004), and inspiring hostility from critics on both the right and\nleft, who have detected in Berlin\u2019s stance complacency,\nhypocrisy, a want of courage and an excess of tolerance (see e.g.\nScruton 1989, Hitchens 1998). This is to be expected, given\nBerlin\u2019s fierce opposition to Communism, combined with his\nrefusal to ally himself to extreme anti-Communism, as well as his\nambivalence or reticence on many divisive political issues of his own\nday.\n\nHowever, even as the ideological battles of the Cold War recede into\nthe past (not everywhere: in post-Communist Europe, in China and\nRussia and elsewhere they are still very much alive), Berlin remains\nthe object of varying interpretations and evaluations. This may appear\nodd in a thinker who wrote clearly, and without obfuscating jargon.\nBut it is unsurprising, given the complexity of Berlin\u2019s vision,\nhis aversion to systematic exposition or theorising, the multifaceted\nnature of his work, and the uniqueness of his position in the\nintellectual life of his times. These qualities make it difficult not\nonly to evaluate Berlin, but also to situate him in the history of\nideas; for he appears at once typical and atypical of the period in\nwhich he lived, and also both ahead of his time and somewhat\nold-fashioned.\n\nIn his youth, Berlin\u2019s intellectual development followed that of\nEnglish-language philosophy; yet he drifted away from the analytic\nphilosophy in which he had once been deeply involved, and his later\nwritings are a world away from most Anglo-American philosophy of their\ntime. On the other hand, for all his range of historical and cultural\nreference, and his concern with moral and aesthetic questions, and\ndespite the influence of Kant and Kant\u2019s successors on his\nthought, Berlin seems out of place in the world of Continental\nphilosophy. Yet it would be a mistake to accept Berlin\u2019s own\njudgement that he had departed from the realm of philosophy\naltogether. For both the views he had formed while working as a\nprofessional philosopher, and his tendency to connect political,\nhistorical and cultural issues to deeper moral and epistemological\nquestions, set his work apart from that of other historians and\n\u2018public intellectuals\u2019 of his day.\n\nBerlin was, for much of his life, an intellectually lonely figure,\npursuing the history of ideas in an academic setting that was\nunreceptive to it, and advocating a moderate liberalism in a time\ndominated by ideological extremism. And yet this plea for moderation\nand advocacy of liberalism was shared and taken up by many others at\nthe\n time.[30]\n His interest in political philosophy and his dedication to the\ndefence of liberalism anticipated the work of John Rawls (who had been\ninfluenced by Berlin during a stay at Oxford while a young academic);\nyet the resurgence of normative political theory initiated by\nRawls\u2019s work coincided with a period of eclipse in\nBerlin\u2019s reputation. Berlin\u2019s concern with the nature of\nculture anticipated the centrality in political theory of questions of\nidentity and membership that began in the 1990s; his sympathy for the\nsentiments and needs underlying nationalism, which set him apart from\nmany liberal theorists of his own time, presaged the revival of\n\u2018liberal nationalism\u2019 in the works of younger thinkers\nsuch as Michael Walzer, David Miller, Yael Tamir and Michael\nIgnatieff. His attack on monism, on the quest for certainty and the\nproject of systematic knowledge, has led him to be embraced by some\ncritics of foundationalism such as Richard Rorty and John Gray. Yet\nBerlin\u2019s work remains difficult to assimilate to intellectual\nmovements or projects such as postmodernism or multiculturalism, the\nexcesses and obscurities of which provoked quizzical scepticism in him\ntowards the end of his life.\n\nNor is Berlin easy to identify seamlessly with those intellectual\npositions that he explicitly propounded \u2013 liberalism and\npluralism. Although he appears as an important, and indeed emblematic,\nexponent of liberalism \u2013 along with Rawls, one of the most\nimportant liberal theorists of his century \u2013 his ideas may\nnevertheless in the end help to undermine, or at least challenge,\nconventional, often monistic, liberalism. This question has come to\npreoccupy many readers of Berlin\u2019s work, and predominate in\ndiscussions of his legacy, to the extent of threatening to overshadow\nother aspects of his thought.\n\nThe debate over pluralism and liberalism raises important conceptual\nissues; yet it becomes somewhat misleading, both in itself and\nparticularly as a guide to Berlin\u2019s thought, if pluralism and\nliberalism are taken to be comprehensive doctrines, or if they are\nreified into independently existing, systematic entities.\n\u2018Pluralism\u2019 and \u2018liberalism\u2019 as general terms\nare abstractions which can help to group, analyse and compare the\npositions of different thinkers, or to characterise different facets\nof the thought of a single thinker. Neither, however, is likely to\ncapture the whole of an individual position; and neither in itself\nencompasses or sums up Berlin\u2019s own outlook.\n\nBerlin himself insisted that political and ethical theories arise from\na thinker\u2019s basic conception of human nature, which in turn is\nfounded on an entire philosophical outlook, a conception of the nature\nof the universe, reality, knowledge etc. The vision underlying\nBerlin\u2019s political and ethical theory, while it may have been\ncoherent (this is itself arguable), was not systematic, and, again, it\ncannot be accurately characterised simply as pluralistic or liberal.\n\u2018Pluralism\u2019 can be used, more narrowly, to describe\nBerlin\u2019s theory of values. It can also be employed more broadly,\nto capture something of his vision of reality, the universe and human\nnature \u2013 that is, the view that all of these things are\ncomplexes made up of separate and conflicting parts: that the self is\nprotean and open-ended, that the universe is not a harmonious cosmos,\nthat reality presents many separate aspects, which can and should be\nviewed from different perspectives. But \u2018pluralism\u2019, as\nexplicitly defined by Berlin and others, does not cover Berlin\u2019s\nempiricism, or his historicism, or his awareness of the fallibility of\nhuman knowledge, or his belief in the primary importance of\nindividuals as opposed to generalisations and abstractions, or his\nemphasis on the importance of free choice (which, while he sought to\nfound it on pluralism, in fact appears to be partly independent of\nit). Nor does pluralism, with its emphasis on the place of tragic\nconflict and loss in human life, capture the affirmative zest for life\nand delighted enthusiasm for human beings that was central to\nBerlin\u2019s persona as a man and thinker. Berlin\u2019s thought,\nlike his writing, is made up both of swathes of sharp colour and of\nminutely variegated and subtle shades of light and darkness; it thus\nresists summary and simple conclusions, and repays persistent and\nopen-ended study.\n",
