    "main_text": "Epistemic Value\n6. Epistemic Value\n\nWhat is the nature of epistemic value and how is knowledge\ndistinctively epistemically valuable? In particular, why is knowledge\nmore valuable than mere true belief, especially if true belief serves\njust as well for guiding action? Such questions have occupied center\nstage in recent epistemology and date back at least to Plato\u2019s\nMeno (see Pritchard & Turri 2014 for an overview). Many\nvirtue epistemologists think that their approach is uniquely suited to\nprovide satisfying answers to these questions.\n\nZagzebski (2003) argues that an adequate account of knowledge must\nexplain why knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. This is\nknown as \u201cthe value problem\u201d. VE is well positioned to\nsolve it, she argues, because the correct solution must help us see\nhow knowledge possesses value independently of anything\n\u201cexternal\u201d to its production. A good cup of coffee is not\nbetter simply because it was made by a good, reliable coffee machine.\nLikewise a true belief is not made better simply because it was formed\nby a reliable method. The added value must come from something\n\u201cinternal\u201d to it. The solution is to view knowledge as a\ncredit-worthy state of the agent, produced or sustained by her\nvirtuous agency.\n\nGreco (2009, 2012) and Sosa (2003, 2007, 2020) contend that knowledge\nis a kind of achievement\u2014intellectual success through ability,\nfor which the knower is creditable. And in general, success through\nvirtue is more valuable than mere success, especially accidental\nsuccess. So knowledge is more valuable than true belief. Riggs (2009:\n342; see also Riggs 1998 & 2002) puts the point succinctly:\n\n\nThe reason that credit-worthiness views of knowledge can solve the\nvalue problem is that they introduce a new vector of value:\ncredit\u2026. If knowing that p always entails that one\ndeserves credit for having achieved a true belief, then this\nintroduces something besides true belief that is valuable\n\n\nCarter, Jarvis and Rubin (2015) propose a taxonomy of varieties of\ncognitive achievement based on the relative weights given to achieving\nsuccess versus avoiding failure; for example, having a suspicion that\np is a cognitive attempt that puts more weight on achieving\nsuccess, whereas Cartesian certainty that p is a cognitive\nattempt to puts almost exclusive weight on avoiding failure.\n\nAristotle made a related distinction between achieving some end by\nluck or accident, and achieving it through the exercise of one\u2019s\nabilities or virtues. It is only the latter kind of action, he argues,\nthat is both intrinsically valuable and constitutive of human\nflourishing. \u201cHuman good\u201d, he writes, \u201cturns out to\nbe activity of soul exhibiting excellence\u201d (Nicomachean\nEthics 1098a15\u201316; translation by W. D. Ross 1984, p. 1735). The\nsuccessful exercise of one\u2019s intellectual virtues is both\nintrinsically good and constitutive of human flourishing. This\npertains to moral and intellectual virtue. Assuming the basic VE line\non knowledge is correct, we get a straightforward solution to the\nvalue problem.\n",
