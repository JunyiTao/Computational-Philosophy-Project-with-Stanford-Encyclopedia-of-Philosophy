The development of hybrid logic since Prior\n\nThe first completely rigorous definition of hybrid logic was given in\nBull (1970), which appeared in a special issue of the journal\nTheoria in memory of Prior. Bull introduces a third sort of\npropositional symbols where a propositional symbol is assumed to be\ntrue exactly at one branch (\u201ccourse of events\u201d) in a\nbranching time model. This idea of sorting propositional symbols\naccording to restrictions on their interpretations has been developed\nfurther by a number of authors, see Section 5 of the paper Blackburn\nand Tzakova (1999) and also Blackburn and Goranko (2001).\n\nThe hybrid logical approach originally invented by Prior in the late\n1960s was reinvented in the 1980s by Solomon Passy and Tinko Tinchev\nfrom Bulgaria, see Passy and Tinchev (1985) as well as Passy and\nTinchev (1991). Rather than ordinary modal logic, this work took place\nin connection with the much more expressive Propositional Dynamic\nLogic.\n\nA major contribution in the 1990s was the introduction of the\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder. An early version of the downarrow\nbinder was introduced by Valentin Goranko in the papers Goranko (1994)\nand Goranko (1996). The version of the present paper was introduced in\nBlackburn and Seligman (1995). Since then, hybrid logic with the\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder has been extensively studied, see for\nexample the paper Areces, Blackburn, and Marx (2001) on\nmodel-theoretic aspects of this logic. A comprehensive study of the\nmodel-theory of hybrid logic is the PhD thesis of ten Cate (2004). The\npaper Areces, Fervari, Hoffmann, and Martel (2018) considers the\nrelationship between strong hybrid logics with the\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder and what are called relation-changing\nmodal logics.\n\nAlso the weaker hybrid logic obtained by omitting both of the binders\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) has been the subject\nof extensive exploration. It turns out that this binder-free logic and\na number of variants of it are decidable. In the paper Areces,\nBlackburn, and Marx (1999), a number of complexity results are given\nfor hybrid modal and tense logics over various classes of frames, for\nexample arbitrary, transitive, linear, and branching. It is remarkable\nthat the satisfiability problem of the binder-free hybrid logic over\narbitrary frames is decidable in PSPACE, which is the same as the\ncomplexity of deciding satisfiability in ordinary modal logic. Thus,\nhybridizing ordinary modal logic gives more expressive power, but the\ncomplexity stays the same. Some work has been carried out on\nsimulating nominals inside modal logic, see Kracht and Wolter\n(1997).\n\nAny ordinary modal formula expresses a monadic second-order property\non frames, and it is well-known that for some modal formulas,\nincluding what are called Sahlqvist formulas, the second-order\nproperty is equivalent to a first-order property. In the paper Goranko\nand Vakarelov (2006) this is shown to hold also for a class of\nhybrid-logical formulas, including nominals. Several algorithms exists\nfor calculating first-order equivalents of ordinary modal formulas.\nOne such algorithm, SQEMA, is in the paper Conradie, Goranko, and\nVakarelov (2006) extended to encompass the hybrid-logical formulas\nconsidered in Goranko and Vakarelov (2006).\n\nAs described in the previous section, Prior introduced hybrid tense\nlogic to deal with a particular issue in the philosophy of time, but\nin Prior (1968), Chapter XIV (also Chapter XIV in the new edition\nPrior (2003)), he also showed that hybrid tense logic can replace a\ntwo-dimensional temporal logic introduced by Hans Kamp in unpublished\nmaterial circulated in 1967, and later included in Kamp (1971). The\ndimension is simply the number of instants a formula is evaluated\nrelative to, so adding hybrid-logical machinery enables two dimensions\nto be replaced by one. This work has recently been followed up in a\nnumber of papers by Blackburn and J\u00f8rgensen, see Blackburn and\nJ\u00f8rgensen (2016a) for an overview. We now give a brief sketch\nof this line of work, adapted to the terminology of the present entry.\nThe version of hybrid logic in question has a designated nominal\n\\(\\mathtt{now}\\) and each model comes with a designated time \\( t_0 \\)\nsuch that i) any stand-alone formula is evaluated relative to \\( t_0\n\\) and ii) the nominal \\(\\mathtt{now}\\) refers to \\( t_0 \\). More\nformally, we adopt the convention that \\((M,t_0), g \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) means \\(M, g, t_0 \\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\) and we only\nconsider assignments \\(g\\) where \\(g(\\mathtt{now})=t_0\\). Note that\nthe nominal \\(\\mathtt{now}\\), considered as a stand-alone formula, is\nvalid in this semantics, but this is not the case for any other\nnominal. This new notion of validity is by Blackburn and\nJ\u00f8rgensen called contextual validity. The paper\nBlackburn and J\u00f8rgensen (2013) gives an axiom system which is\ncomplete wrt. this notion of contextual validity. The paper Blackburn\nand J\u00f8rgensen (2012) gives a complete tableau system, but the\nsemantics of this paper is in line with Kamp\u2019s original\ntwo-dimensional semantics. Both papers also consider further\nindexicals like \\(\\mathtt{yesterday}\\), \\(\\mathtt{today}\\) and\n\\(\\mathtt{tomorrow}\\). \n\nThe paper Blackburn and J\u00f8rgensen (2016b) uses hybrid tense\nlogic to combine ideas of Prior with those of Hans Reichenbach on how\nto represent natural language tenses. Prior preferred the well-known\ntense operators described above, whereas Reichenbach preferred\ntemporal references, that is, references to specific times,\nReichenbach (1947). It turns out that the two approaches can be\ncombined, which was not the route taken by Prior\nhimself\u2013\u2013see the account given in Blackburn and\nJ\u00f8rgensen (2016b), \n\nHybrid-logical notions have been applied in many different places, for\nexample, the paper Areces and Fervari (2021) adds hybrid operators to\nXPath, which is a widely used query language for XML, a markup\nlanguage for describing digital text. Hybrid-logical has also been\nused to add expressive power to specification logics to capture\ncertain properties of computational systems, see Neves, Madeira,\nMartins, Barbosa (2016). It should, moreover, be mentioned that logics\nsimilar to hybrid logics play a central role within the area of\ndescription logic, which is a family of logics used for knowledge\nrepresentation in Artificial Intelligence, see the paper Blackburn and\nTzakova (1998) and Carlos Areces\u2019 PhD thesis (2000).\n",
