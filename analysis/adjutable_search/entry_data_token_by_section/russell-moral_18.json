One argument, subsequently popularized by J.L. Mackie (1977)\nas \u201cthe Argument from Relativity\u201d, starts with the\ndiversity of moral opinion and the supposed impossibility of proof\nwhen it comes to ultimate values.\n\n\nIf our views as to what ought to be done were to be truly rational, we\nought to have a rational way of ascertaining what things are such as\nought to exist on their own account [that is, what things are good]\n\u2026. On [this] point, no argument is possible. There can be\nnothing beyond an appeal to individual tastes. If, for example, one\nman thinks vindictive punishment desirable in itself, apart from any\nreformatory or deterrent effects, while another man thinks it\nundesirable in itself, it is impossible to bring any arguments in\nsupport of either side. (RoE: 112/Papers 13:\n186)\n\n\nNow it is, of course, a consequence of Russell\u2019s later view\nboth a) that it is impossible to have a rational argument about\n\u201cwhat things are such as ought to exist on their own\naccount\u201d and b) that in such disputes there can be nothing\nbeyond \u201can appeal to individual tastes\u201d. But though you\ncan argue from emotivism and the non-existence of objective\ngoodness to the truth of a) and b), can you argue\nfrom a) and b) to the non-existence of objective\ngoodness?\n\nThe argument, I suggest, is best construed as an inference to the best\nexplanation. The best explanation of a) that it is impossible to have\na rational argument about what is good or bad in itself and b) that in\nsuch disputes there can be nothing beyond \u201can appeal to\nindividual tastes\u201d is the hypothesis c) that there is nothing\nobjective to disagree about since there is no such thing as\ngoodness\u2014rather our opinions on these topics are somehow\ndependent on, or expressive of, our disparate desires and perhaps our\ndiverse upbringings.\n\nIs this a good argument? Not by itself, no. For it is not clear that\ntheses a) and b) represent genuine facts. And even if a) and b)\nare true and do represent genuine facts, is c) the\nbest explanation? Perhaps there is a property of goodness but it\nhappens to be a property that it is difficult to discern. Some people\nare just better at seeing what is good or bad than others. As Russell\nhimself put it in 1909 \u201cthe difficulty of discovering the truth\ndoes not prove that there is no truth to be discovered\u201d\n(Philosophical Essays: 20/Papers 6: 222).\n\nHowever, the Argument From Relativity looks a little better if we\nfollow Russell\u2019s hints and combine it with the Argument from\nExplanatory Impotence.\n",
