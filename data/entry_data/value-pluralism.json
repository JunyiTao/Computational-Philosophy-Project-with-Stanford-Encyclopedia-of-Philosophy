    "preamble": "\n\nThe word \u2018pluralism\u2019 generally refers to the view that\nthere are many of the things in question (concepts, scientific world\nviews, discourses, viewpoints etc.) The issues arising from there\nbeing many differ widely from subject area to subject area. This entry\nis concerned with moral pluralism\u2014the view that there are many\ndifferent moral values.\n\nMoral value pluralism should be distinguished from political\npluralism. Political pluralism, which, like moral value pluralism, is\noften referred to as \u2018value pluralism\u2019, is a view\nassociated with political liberalism. Political pluralism is concerned\nwith the question of what sort of restrictions governments can put on\npeople\u2019s freedom to act according to their values. One version\nof political pluralism is based on moral value pluralism, claiming\nthat there are irreducibly plural moral values and that this justifies\na liberal political system. (See Isaiah Berlin 1969; George Crowder\n2002, 2019; William Galston 2002, and for a more detailed discussion\nof this see the entry on\n Isaiah Berlin).\n Political Liberalism need not be based on value pluralism: a defence\nof toleration of different value systems need not rely on the claim\nthat there are plural moral values. We shall leave political pluralism\naside for the purposes of this entry, and concentrate on moral value\npluralism.\n\nIt is also worth emphasising that moral value pluralism does not\nentail relativism. The idea is not that all values or value systems\nare equally true. Value pluralism is independent of any particular\nmeta-ethical view. It is a claim about the normative domain: about\nwhat value looks like.\n\nCommonsensically we talk about lots of different\nvalues\u2014happiness, liberty, friendship, and so on. The question\nabout pluralism in moral theory is whether these apparently different\nvalues are all reducible to one supervalue, or whether we should think\nthat there really are several distinct values.\n\nThere are different ways that value might be conceived, but the debate\nabout pluralism should be able to cut across different sorts of moral\ntheory. Traditionally, moral philosophers recognize three different\nways of thinking about morality: the deontological way, the\nconsequentialist way, and the virtue ethics way, although there is\ndebate about the cogency of these\n distinctions.[1]\n The term \u2018value\u2019 as it appears in \u2018value\npluralism\u2019 is neutral between these three theories.\nDeontologists think of morality as being fundamentally about moral\nprinciples. Thus the question of whether a deontological theory is\npluralist is a question about how many fundamental principles there\nare. The consequentialist, by contrast, tends to see value as being\nrealized by goods in the world, such as friendship, knowledge, beauty\nand so on, and the question of pluralism is thus a question about how\nmany fundamental goods there are. Virtue ethicists focus on how agents\nshould be, so are interested both in principles of action (or\nmotivation) and the pursuit of goods, such as friendship.\n\nDeontologists can clearly be monists or pluralists. Kant can be\nunderstood as a monist\u2014arguing that there is one overarching\nprinciple, and that all other principles are derived from it. Ross, by\ncontrast, is a pluralist, because he thinks that there is a plurality\nof prima facie duties. (See Kant (1948), Ross\n (1930).)[2]\n\nMany utilitarians are monists, arguing that there is only one\nfundamental value and that is well-being or pleasure or happiness, or\nsomething of that sort. In other words, some utilitarians are\ncommitted to hedonism. Monist utilitarians must claim that all other\nputative values, such as friendship, knowledge and so on, are only\ninstrumental values, which are valuable in so far as they contribute\nto the foundational value. But utilitarians need not be monists.\nAmartya Sen, for example, argues that utilitarians can take a\n\u2018vector view of utility\u2019, according to which there are\ndifferences in the qualities as well of the quantities of utility in\ngoods in the world. According to Sen, we should interpret Mill as a\npluralist in this way. (We return to Mill below: it is not entirely\nclear how we should understand his view). Sen points out that desire\nsatisfaction theorists can be pluralists too. Just as different sorts\nof pleasure might have different sorts of value, so different desires\nmight have different sorts of value. (Sen, 1981). Even utilitarians\nwho claim that the value to be maximized is well-being can be\npluralist: a prominent view of well-being is that well-being itself is\nplural, an objective list of things that are fundamentally plural.\n(See Finnis 1980; Griffin 1986; for recent defences see Fletcher 2013;\nLin 2014). Another reason to think that hedonistic utilitarians should\nbe pluralists is that it seems essential to say something about the\ndisvalue of pain. As Shelly Kagan points out (2014), we need an\naccount of ill-being in addition to an account of well-being.\n\nIn what follows, the presentation will be as neutral as possible\nbetween different theoretical approaches to morality, and will focus\non the debate between monists and pluralists. Monists claim that there\nis only one ultimate value. Pluralists argue that there really are\nseveral different values, and that these values are not reducible to\neach other or to a supervalue. Monism has the advantage of relative\nsimplicity: once it has been determined what the supervalue is\n(whether we think of the super value in terms of the goods approach or\nany other approach) much of the hard work has been done. On the other\nhand, monism may be too simple: it may not capture the real texture of\nour ethical lives. However, pluralism faces the difficulty of\nexplaining how different fundamental values relate to each other, and\nhow they can be compared.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Some Preliminary Clarifications\n1.1 Foundational and Non-foundational Pluralism\n\nIt is important to clarify the levels at which a moral theory might be\npluralistic. Let us distinguish between two levels of pluralism:\nfoundational and non-foundational. Foundational pluralism is the view\nthat there are plural moral values at the most basic level\u2014that\nis to say, there is no one value that subsumes all other values, no\none property of goodness, and no overarching principle of action.\nNon-foundational pluralism is the view that there are plural values at\nthe level of choice, but these apparently plural values can be\nunderstood in terms of their contribution to one more fundamental\n value.[3]\n\nJudith Jarvis Thomson, a foundational pluralist, argues that when we\nsay that something is good we are never ascribing a property of\ngoodness, rather we are always saying that the thing in question is\ngood in some way. If we say that a fountain pen is good we mean\nsomething different from when we say that a logic book is good, or a\nfilm is good. As Thomson puts it, all goodness is a goodness in a way.\nThomson focusses her argument on Moore, who argues that when we say\n\u2018x is good\u2019 we do not mean \u2018x is\nconducive to pleasure\u2019, or \u2018x is in accordance\nwith a given set of rules\u2019 and nor do we mean anything else that\nis purely descriptive. As Moore points out, we can always query\nwhether any purely descriptive property really is good\u2014so he\nconcludes that goodness is simple and\n unanalyzable.[4]\n Moore is thus a foundational monist, he thinks that there is one\nnon-natural property of goodness, and that all good things are good in\nvirtue of having this property. Thomson finds this preposterous. In\nThomson\u2019s own words:\n\nMoore says that the question he will be addressing himself to in what\nfollows is the question \u2018What is good?\u2019, and he rightly\nthinks that we are going to need a bit of help in seeing exactly what\nquestion he is expressing in those words. He proposes to help us by\ndrawing attention to a possible answer to the question he is\nexpressing\u2014that is, to something that would be an answer to it,\nwhether or not it is the correct answer to it. Here is what he offers\nus: \u201cBooks are good.\u201d Books are good? What would you mean\nif you said \u2018Books are good\u2019? Moore, however, goes\nplacidly on: \u201cthough [that would be] an answer obviously false;\nfor some books are very bad indeed\u201d. Well some books are bad to\nread or to look at, some are bad for use in teaching philosophy, some\nare bad for children. What sense could be made of a person who said,\n\u201cNo. no. I meant that some books are just plain bad\nthings\u201d? (Thomson 1997, pp. 275\u2013276)\n\n\nAccording to Thomson there is a fundamental plurality of ways of being\ngood. We cannot reduce them to something they all have in common, or\nsensibly claim that there is a disjunctive property of goodness (such\nthat goodness is \u2018goodness in one of the various ways\u2019.\nThomson argues that that could not be an interesting property as each\ndisjunct is truly different from every other disjunct. Thomson (1997),\np. 277). Thomson is thus a foundational pluralist\u2014she does not\nthink that there is any one property of value at the most basic\nlevel.\n\nW.D. Ross is a foundational pluralist in a rather complex way. Most\nstraightforwardly, Ross thinks that there are several prima facie\nduties, and there is nothing that they all have in common: they are\nirreducibly plural. This is the aspect of Ross\u2019s view that is\nreferred to with the phrase, \u2018Ross-style pluralism\u2019.\nHowever, Ross also thinks that there are goods in the world (justice\nand pleasure, for example), and that these are good because of some\nproperty they share. Goodness and rightness are not reducible to one\nanother, so Ross is a pluralist about types of value as well as about\nprinciples.\n\nWriters do not always make the distinction between foundational and\nother forms of pluralism, but as well as Thomson and Ross, at least\nBernard Williams (1981), Charles Taylor (1982), Stuart Hampshire\n(1983), Charles Larmore (1987), John Kekes (1993), Michael Stocker\n(1990 and 1997), David Wiggins (1997), Christine Swanton (2001), and\nJonathan Dancy (2004) are all committed to foundational pluralism.\n\nNon-foundational pluralism is less radical\u2014it posits a plurality\nof bearers of value. In fact, almost everyone accepts that there are\nplural bearers of value. This is compatible with thinking that there\nis only one ultimate value. G.E. Moore (1903), Thomson\u2019s target,\nis a foundational monist, but he accepts that there are\nnon-foundational plural values. Moore thinks that there are many\ndifferent bearers of value, but he thinks that there is one property\nof goodness, and that it is a simple non-natural property that bearers\nof value possess in varying degrees. Moore is clear that comparison\nbetween plural goods proceeds in terms of the amount of goodness they\nhave.\n\nThis is not to say that the amount of goodness is always a matter of\nsimple addition. Moore thinks that there can be organic unities, where\nthe amount of goodness contributed by a certain value will vary\naccording to the combination of values such as love and friendship.\nThus Moore\u2019s view is pluralist at the level of ordinary choices,\nand that is not without interesting consequences. (We return to the\nissue of how a foundational monist like Moore can account for organic\nunities in section 3.)\n\nMill, a classic utilitarian, could be and often has been interpreted\nas thinking that there are irreducibly different sorts of pleasure.\nMill argues that there are higher and lower pleasures, and that the\nhigher pleasures (pleasures of the intellect as opposed to the body)\nare superior, in that higher pleasures can outweigh lower pleasures\nregardless of the quantity of the latter. As Mill puts it: \u201cIt\nis quite compatible with the principle of utility to recognize the\nfact, that some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable\nthan others.\u201d (2002, p. 241). On the foundational pluralist\ninterpretation of Mill, there is not one ultimate good, but two (at\nleast): higher and lower pleasures. Mill goes on to give an account of\nwhat he means:\n\nIf I am asked, what I mean by difference in quality in pleasures, or\nwhat makes one pleasure more valuable than another, merely as a\npleasure, except its being greater in amount, there is but one\npossible answer. Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or\nalmost all who have experience of both give a decided preference,\nirrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is\nthe more desirable pleasure. (2002, p. 241).\n\n\nThe passage is ambiguous, it is not clear what role the expert judges\nplay in the theory. On the pluralist interpretation of this passage we\nmust take Mill as intending the role of the expert judges as a purely\nheuristic device: thinking about what such people would prefer is a\nway of discovering which pleasures are higher and which are lower, but\nthe respective values of the pleasure is independent of the\njudges\u2019 judgment. On a monist interpretation we must understand\nMill as a preference utilitarian: the preferences of the judges\ndetermine value. On this interpretation there is one property of value\n(being preferred by expert judges) and many bearers of value (whatever\nthe judges\n prefer).[5]\n\nBefore moving on, it is worth noting that a theory might be\nfoundationally monist in its account of what values there are, but not\nrecommend that people attempt to think or make decisions on the basis\nof the supervalue. A distinction between decision procedures and\ncriteria of right has become commonplace in moral philosophy. For\nexample, a certain form of consequentialism has as its criterion of\nright action: act so as to maximize good consequences. This might\ninvite the complaint that an agent who is constantly trying to\nmaximize good consequences will often, in virtue of that fact, fail to\ndo so. Sometimes concentrating too hard on the goal will make it less\nlikely that the goal is achieved. A distinction between decision\nprocedure and right action can provide a response\u2014the\nconsequentialist can say that the criterion of right action, (act so\nas to maximize good consequences) is not intended as a decision\nprocedure\u2014the agent should use whichever decision procedure is\nmost likely to result in success. If, then, there is some attraction\nor instrumental advantage from the point of view of a particular\ntheory to thinking in pluralist terms, then it is open to that theory\nto have a decision procedure that deals with apparently plural values,\neven if the theory is monist in every other way.\n [6]\n1.2 A Purely Verbal Dispute?\n\nOne final clarification about different understandings of pluralism\nought to be made. There is an ambiguity between the name for a group\nof values and the name for one unitary value. There are really two\nproblems here: distinguishing between the terms that refer to groups\nand the terms that refer to individuals (a merely linguistic problem)\nand defending the view that there really is a candidate for a unitary\nvalue (a metaphysical problem). The linguistic problem comes about\nbecause in natural language we may use a singular term as\n\u2018shorthand\u2019: conceptual analysis may reveal that surface\ngrammar does not reflect the real nature of the concept. For example,\nwe use the term \u2018well-being\u2019 as if it refers to one single\nthing, but it is not hard to see that it may not.\n\u2018Well-being\u2019 may be a term that we use to refer to a group\nof things such as pleasure, health, a sense of achievement and so on.\nA theory that tells us that well-being is the only value may only be\nnominally monist. The metaphysical question is more difficult, and\nconcerns whether there are any genuinely unitary values at all.\n\nThe metaphysical question is rather different for naturalist and\nnon-naturalist accounts of value. On Moore\u2019s non-naturalist\naccount, goodness is a unitary property but it is not a natural\nproperty: it is not empirically available to us, but is known by a\nspecial faculty of intuition. It is very clear that Moore thinks that\ngoodness is a genuinely unitary property:\n\n\u2018Good\u2019, then, if we mean by it that quality which we\nassert to belong to a thing, when we say that the thing is good, is\nincapable of any definition, in the most important sense of that word.\nThe most important sense of \u2018definition\u2019 is that in which\na definition states what are the parts which invariably compose a\ncertain whole; and in this sense \u2018good\u2019 has no definition\nbecause it is simple and has no parts. (Moore, 1903, p. 9)\n\n\nThe question of whether there could be such a thing is no more easy or\ndifficult than any question about the existence of non-natural\nentities. The issue of whether the entity is genuinely unitary is not\nan especially difficult part of that issue.\n\nBy contrast, naturalist views do face a particular difficulty in\ngiving an account of a value that is genuinely unitary. On the goods\napproach, for example, the claim must be that there is one good that\nis genuinely singular, not a composite of other goods. So for example,\na monist hedonist must claim that pleasure really is just one thing.\nPleasure is a concept we use to refer to something we take to be in\nthe natural world, and conceptual analysis may or may not confirm that\npleasure really is one thing. Perhaps, for example, we refer both to\nintellectual and sensual experiences as pleasure. Or, take another\ngood often suggested by proponents of the goods approach to value,\nfriendship. It seems highly unlikely that there is one thing that we\ncall friendship, even if there are good reasons to use one umbrella\nconcept to refer to all those different things. Many of the plausible\ncandidates for the good seem plausible precisely because they are very\nbroad terms. If a theory is to be properly monist then, it must have\nan account of the good that is satisfactorily unitary.\n\nThe problem applies to the deontological approach to value too. It is\noften relatively easy to determine whether a principle is really two\nor more principles in disguise\u2014the presence of a conjunction or\na disjunction, for example, is a clear giveaway. However, principles\ncan contain terms that are unclear. Take for example a deontological\ntheory that tells us to respect friendship. As mentioned previously,\nit is not clear whether there is one thing that is friendship or more\nthan one, so it is not clear whether this is one principle about one\nthing, or one principle about several things, or whether it is really\nmore than one principle.\n\nQuestions about what makes individuals individuals and what the\nrelationship is between parts and wholes have been discussed in the\ncontext of metaphysics but these issues have not been much discussed\nin the literature on pluralism and monism in moral philosophy.\nHowever, these issues are implicit in discussions of the well-being,\nnature of friendship and pleasure, and in the literature on\nKant\u2019s categorical imperative, or on Aristotelian accounts of\neudaimonia. Part of an investigation into the nature of these things\nis an investigation into whether there really is one thing or not.\n [7]\n\nThe upshot of this brief discussion is that monists must be able to\ndefend their claim that the value they cite is genuinely one value.\nThere may be fewer monist theories than it first appears. Further, the\nmonist must accept the implications of a genuinely monist view. As\nRuth Chang points out, (2015, p. 24) the simpler the monist\u2019s\naccount of the good is, the less likely it is that the monist will be\nable to give a good account of the various complexities in choice that\nseem an inevitable part of our experience of value. But on the other\nhand, if the monist starts to admit that the good is complex, the view\ngets closer and closer to being a pluralist view.\n\nHowever, the dispute between monists and pluralists is not merely\nverbal: there is no prima facie reason to think that there are no\ngenuinely unitary properties, goods or principles.\n2. The Attraction of Pluralism\n\nIf values are plural, then choices between them will be complex.\nPluralists have pressed the point that choices are complex, and so we\nshould not shy away from the hypothesis that values are plural. In\nbrief, the attraction of pluralism is that it seems to allow for the\ncomplexity and conflict that is part of our moral experience. We do\nnot experience our moral choices as simple additive puzzles.\nPluralists have argued that there are incommensurabilities and\ndiscontinuities in value comparisons, value remainders (or residues)\nwhen choices are made, and complexities in appropriate responses to\nvalue. Recent empirical work confirms that our ethical experience is\nof apparently irreducible plural values. (See Gill and Nichols,\n2008.)\n2.1 Discontinuities\n\nJohn Stuart Mill suggested that there are higher and lower pleasures\n(Mill 2002, p. 241), the idea being that the value of higher and lower\npleasures is measured on different scales. In other words, there are\ndiscontinuities in the measurement of value. As mentioned previously,\nit is unclear whether we should interpret Mill as a foundational\npluralist, but the notion of higher and lower pleasures is a very\nuseful one to illustrate the attraction of thinking that there are\ndiscontinuities in value. The distinction between higher and lower\npleasures allows us to say that no amount of lower pleasures can\noutweigh some amount of higher pleasures. As Mill puts it, it is\nbetter to be an unhappy human being than a happy pig. In other words,\nthe distinction allows us to say that there are discontinuities in\nvalue addition. As James Griffin (1986, p. 87) puts it: \u201cWe do\nseem, when informed, to rank a certain amount of life at a very high\nlevel above any amount of life at a very low level.\u201d\nGriffin\u2019s point is that there are discontinuities in the way we\nrank values, and this suggests that there are different\n values.[8]\n The phenomenon of discontinuities in our value rankings seems to\nsupport pluralism: if higher pleasures are not outweighed by lower\npleasures, that suggests that they are not the same sort of thing. For\nif they were just the same sort of thing, there seems to be no reason\nwhy lower pleasures will not eventually outweigh higher pleasures.\n\nRuth Chang argues that values form organic unities, which is to say\nthat adding more of one value to a situation may not make it better\noverall, the balance of values in the situation is also important. For\nexample, a life where extra pleasure is added, and all other value\ncontributions left untouched, may not be better overall, because now\nthe pleasure is unbalanced (Chang 2002). As Chang puts it, the Pareto\nprinciple of improvement (if something is better along one dimension\nand at least as good on all the others it will be better overall) does\nnot hold here.\n\nThe most extreme form of discontinuity is incommensurability or\nincomparability, when two values cannot be ranked at all. Pluralists\ndiffer on whether pluralism entails incommensurabilities, and on what\nincommensurability entails for the possibility of choice. Griffin\ndenies that pluralism entails incommensurability (Griffin uses the\nterm incomparability) whereas other pluralists embrace\nincommensurability, but deny that it entails that rational choice is\nimpossible. Some pluralists accept that there are sometimes cases\nwhere incommensurability precludes rational choice. We shall return to\nthese issues in Section 4.\n2.2 Value Conflicts and Rational Regret\n\nMichael Stocker (1990) and Bernard Williams (1973 and 1981) and others\nhave argued that it can be rational to regret the outcome of a correct\nmoral choice. That is, even when the right choice has been made, the\nrejected option can reasonably be regretted, and so the choice\ninvolves a genuine value conflict. This seems strange if the options\nare being compared in terms of a supervalue. How can we regret having\nchosen more rather than less of the same thing? Yet the phenomenon\nseems undeniable, and pluralism can explain it. If there are plural\nvalues, then one can rationally regret not having chosen something\nwhich though less good, was different.\n\nIt is worth noting that the pluralist argument is not that all cases\nof value conflict point to pluralism. There may be conflicts because\nof ignorance, for example, or because of irrationality, and these do\nnot require positing plural values. Stocker argues that there are (at\nleast) two sorts of value conflict that require plural values. The\nfirst is conflict that involves choices between doing things at\ndifferent times. Stocker argues that goods become different values in\ndifferent temporal situations, and the monist cannot accommodate this\nthought. The other sort of case (which Williams also points to) is\nwhen there is a conflict between things that have different advantages\nand disadvantages. The better option may be better, but it does not\n\u2018make up for\u2019 the lesser option, because it isn\u2019t\nthe same sort of thing. Thus there is a remainder\u2014a moral value\nthat is lost in the choice, and that it is rational to regret.\n\nBoth Martha Nussbaum (1986) and David Wiggins (1980) have argued for\npluralism on the grounds that only pluralism can explain akrasia, or\nweakness of will. An agent is said to suffer from weakness of will\nwhen she knowingly chooses a less good option over a better one. On\nthe face of it, this is a puzzling thing to do\u2014why would someone\nknowingly do what they know to be worse? A pluralist has a plausible\nanswer\u2014when the choice is between two different sorts of value,\nthe agent is preferring A to B, rather than preferring less of A to\nmore of A. Wiggins explains the akratic choice by suggesting that the\nagent is \u2018charmed\u2019 by some aspect of the choice, and is\nswayed by that to choose what she knows to be worse overall (Wiggins\n1980, p. 257). However, even Michael Stocker, the arch pluralist, does\nnot accept that this argument works. As Stocker points out, Wiggins is\nusing a distinction between a cognitive and an affective element to\nthe choice, and this distinction can explain akrasia on a monist\naccount of value too. Imagine that a monist hedonist agent is faced\nwith a choice between something that will give her more pleasure and\nsomething that will give her less pleasure. The cognitive aspect to\nthe choice is clear\u2014the agent knows that one option is more\npleasurable than the other, and hence on her theory better. However,\nto say that the agent believes that more pleasure is better is not to\nsay that she will always be attracted to the option that is most\npleasurable. She may, on occasion, be attracted to the option that is\nmore unusual or interesting. Hence she may act akratically because she\nwas charmed by some aspect of the less good choice\u2014and as\nStocker says, there is no need to posit plural values to make sense of\nthis\u2014being charmed is not the same as valuing. (Stocker 1990,\np.219).\n2.3 Appropriate Responses to Value\n\nAnother argument for pluralism starts from the observation that there\nare many and diverse appropriate responses to value. Christine Swanton\n(2003, ch. 2) and Elizabeth Anderson (1993) both take this line. As\nSwanton puts it:\n\nAccording to value centered monism, the rightness of moral\nresponsiveness is determined entirely by degree or strength of\nvalue\u2026I shall argue, on the contrary, that just how things are\nto be pursued, nurtured, respected, loved, preserved, protected, and\nso forth may often depend on further general features of those things,\nand their relations to other things, particularly the moral agent.\n(Swanton 2003, p. 41).\n\n\nThe crucial thought is that there are various bases of moral\nresponsiveness, and these bases are irreducibly plural. A monist could\nargue that there are different appropriate responses to value, but the\nmonist would have to explain why there are different appropriate\nresponses to the same value. Swanton\u2019s point is that the only\nexplanation the monist has is that different degrees of value merit\ndifferent responses. According to Swanton, this does not capture what\nis really going on when we appropriately honor or respect a value\nrather than promoting it. Anderson and Swanton both argue that the\ncomplexity of our responses to value can only be explained by a\npluralistic theory.\n\nElizabeth Anderson argues that it is a mistake to understand moral\ngoods on the maximising model. She uses the example of parental love\n(Anderson 1997, p. 98). Parents should not see their love for their\nchildren as being directed towards an \u201caggregate child\ncollective\u201d. Such a view would entail that trade offs were\npossible, that one child could be sacrificed for another. On\nAnderson\u2019s view we can make rational choices between conflicting\nvalues without ranking values: \u201c\u2026choices concerning those\ngoods or their continued existence do not generally require that we\nrank their values on a common scale and choose the more valuable good;\nthey require that we give each good its due\u201d (Anderson 1997, p.\n104).\n3. Monist Solutions\n\nThe last section begins by saying that if foundational values are\nplural, then choices between them will be complex. It is clear that\nour choices are complex. However, it would be invalid to conclude from\nthat that values are plural\u2014the challenge for monists is to\nexplain how they too can make sense of the complexity of our value\nchoices.\n3.1 Different Bearers of Value\n\nOne way for monists to make sense of complexity in value choice is to\npoint out that there are different bearers of value, and this makes a\nbig difference to the experience of choice. (See Hurka, 1996; Schaber,\n1999; Klocksiem 2011). Here is the challenge to monism in Michael\nStocker\u2019s words (Stocker, 1990, p. 272): \u201c[if monism is\ntrue] there is no ground for rational conflict because the better\noption lacks nothing that would be made good by the lesser.\u201d In\nother words, there are no relevant differences between the better and\nworse options except that the better option is better. Thomas Hurka\nobjects that there can be such differences. For example, in a choice\nbetween giving five units of pleasure to A and ten units to\nB, the best option (more pleasure for B) involves\ngiving no pleasure at all to A. So there is something to\nrationally regret, namely, that A had no pleasure. The\nargument can be expanded to deal with all sorts of choice situation:\nin each situation, a monist can say something sensible about an\nunavoidable loss, a loss that really is a loss. If, of two options one\nwill contribute more basic value, the monist must obviously choose\nthat one. But the lesser of the options may contribute value via\npleasure, while the superior option contributes value via knowledge,\nand so there is a loss in choosing the option with the greater value\ncontribution\u2014a loss in pleasure\u2014 and it is rational for us\nto regret this.\n\nThere is one difficulty with this answer. The loss described by Hurka\nis not a moral loss, and so the regret is not moral regret. In\nHurka\u2019s example, the relevant loss is that A does not\nget any pleasure. The agent doing the choosing may be rational to\nregret this if she cares about A, or even if she just feels\nsorry for A, but there has been no moral loss, as\n\u2018pleasure for A\u2019 as opposed to pleasure itself is\nnot a moral value. According to the view under consideration, pleasure\nitself is what matters morally, and so although A\u2019s\npleasure matters qua pleasure, the moral point of view takes\nB\u2019s pleasure into account in just the same way, and\nthere is nothing to regret, as there is more pleasure than there would\notherwise have been. Stocker and Williams would surely insist that the\npoint of their argument was not just that there is a loss, but that\nthere is a moral loss. The monist cannot accommodate that\npoint, as the monist can only consider the quantity of the value, not\nits distribution, and so we are at an impasse.\n\nHowever, the initial question was whether the monist has succeeded in\nexplaining the phenomenon of \u2018moral regret\u2019, and perhaps\nHurka has done that by positing a conflation of moral and non-moral\nregret in our experience. From our point of view, there is regret, and\nthe monist can explain why that is without appealing to irrationality.\nOn the other hand the monist cannot appeal to anything other than\nquantity of value in appraising the morality of the situation. So\nalthough Hurka is clearly right in so far as he is saying that a\ncorrect moral choice can be regretted for non-moral reasons, he can go\nno further than that.\n3.2 Diminishing Marginal Value\n\nAnother promising strategy that the monist can use in order to explain\nthe complexity in our value choices is the appeal to\n\u2018diminishing marginal value\u2019. The value that is added to\nthe sum by a source of value will tend to diminish after a certain\npoint\u2014this phenomenon is known as diminishing marginal value\n(or, sometimes, diminishing marginal utility). Mill\u2019s higher and\nlower pleasures, which seem to be plural values, might be accommodated\nby the monist in this way. The monist makes sense of discontinuities\nin value by insisting on the distinction between sources of value,\nwhich are often ambiguously referred to as \u2018values\u2019, and\nthe super value. Using a monist utilitarian account of value, we can\ndistinguish between the non-evaluative description of options, the\nintermediate description, and the evaluative description as\nfollows:\n\n\n\nNon-evaluative\n\ndescription\u00a0of\u00a0option\nIntermediate\n\ndescription\u00a0of\u00a0option\nEvaluative\n\ndescription\u00a0of\u00a0option \n\nPainting a picture\n\u2192\nProducing x units\n\nof beauty\n\u2192\nProducing y units\n\nof value \n\nReading a book\n\u2192\nProducing x units\n\nof knowledge\n\u2192\nProducing y units\n\nof value  \n\n\nOn this account, painting produces beauty, and beauty (which is not a\nvalue but the intermediate source of value) produces value. Similarly,\nreading a book produces knowledge, and gaining knowledge produces\nvalue. Now it should be clear how the monist can make sense of\nphenomena like higher and lower pleasures. The non-evaluative options\n(e.g. eating donuts) have diminishing marginal non-basic value.\n\nOn top of that, the intermediate effect, or non-basic value, (e.g.\nexperiencing pleasure) can have a diminishing contribution to value.\nVarying diminishing marginal value in these cases is easily explained\npsychologically. It is just the way we are\u2014we get less and less\nenjoyment from donuts as we eat more and more (at least in one\nsitting). However, we may well get the same amount of enjoyment from\nthe tenth Johnny Cash song that we did from the first. In order to\ndeal with the higher and lower pleasures case the monist will have to\nargue that pleasures themselves can have diminishing marginal\nutility\u2014the monist can argue that gustatory pleasure gets boring\nafter a while, and hence contributes less and less to the super\nvalue\u2014well being, or whatever it\n is.[9]\n\nThis picture brings us back to the distinction between foundational\nand non-foundational pluralism. Notice that the monist theories being\nimagined here are foundationally monist, because they claim that there\nis fundamentally one value, such as pleasure, and they are pluralist\nat the level of ordinary choice because they claim that there are\nintermediate values, such as knowledge and beauty, which are valuable\nbecause of the amount of pleasure they produce (or realize, or\ncontain\u2014the exact relationship will vary from theory to\ntheory).\n3.3 Theoretical Virtues\n\nThe main advantage of pluralism is that it seems true to our\nexperience of value. We experience values as plural, and pluralism\ntells is that values are indeed plural. The monist can respond, as we\nhave seen, that there are ways to explain the apparent plurality of\nvalues without positing fundamentally plural values. Another,\ncomplementary strategy that the monist can pursue is to argue that\nmonism has theoretical virtues that pluralism lacks. In general, it\nseems that theories should be as simple and coherent as possible, and\nthat other things being equal, we should prefer a more coherent theory\nto a less coherent one. Thus so long as monism can make sense of\nenough of our intuitive judgments about the nature of value, then it\nis to be preferred to pluralism because it does better on the\ntheoretical virtue of coherence.\n\nAnother way to put this point is in terms of explanation. The monist\ncan point out that the pluralist picture lacks explanatory depth. It\nseems that a list of values needs some further explanation: what makes\nthese things values? (See Bradley 2009, p.16). The monist picture is\nsuperior, because the monist can provide an explanation for the value\nof the (non-foundational) plurality of values: these things are values\nbecause they contribute to well-being, or pleasure, or whatever the\nfoundational monist value is. (See also the discussion of this in the\nentry on\n value theory).\n\nPatricia Marino argues against this strategy (2015). She argues that\n\u2018systematicity\u2019 (the idea that it is better to have fewer\nprinciples) is not a good argument in favour of monism. Marino points\nout that explanation in terms of fewer fundamental principles is not\nnecessarily better explanation. If there are plural values,\nthen the explanation that appeals to plural values is a better one, in\nthe sense that it is the true one: it doesn\u2019t deny the plurality\nof values. Even if we could give a monist explanation without having\nto trade off against our pluralist intuitions, Marino argues, we have\nno particular reason to think that explanations appealing to fewer\nprinciples are superior.\n3.4 Preference Satisfaction Views\n\nThere is a different account of value that we ought to consider here:\nthe view that value consists in preference or desire satisfaction. On\nthis view, knowledge and pleasure and so on are valuable when they are\ndesired, and if they are not desired anymore they are not valuable\nanymore. There is no need to appeal to complicated accounts of\ndiminishing marginal utility: it is uncontroversial that we sometimes\ndesire something and sometimes don\u2019t. Thus complexities in\nchoices are explained by complexities in our desires, and it is\nuncontroversial that our desires are complex.\n\nImagine a one person preference satisfaction account of value that\nsays simply that what is valuable is what P desires.\nApparently this view is foundationally monist: there is only one thing\nthat confers value (being desired by P), yet at the\nnon-foundational level there are many values (whatever P\ndesires). Let us say that P desires hot baths, donuts and\nknowledge. The structure of P\u2019s desires is such that\nthere is a complicated ranking of these things, which will vary from\ncircumstance to circumstance. The ranking is not explained by the\nvalue of the objects,rather, her desire explains the ranking and\ndetermines the value of the objects. So it might be that P\nsometimes desires a hot bath and a donut equally, and cannot choose\nbetween them; it might be that sometimes she would choose knowledge\nover a hot bath and a donut, but sometimes she would choose a hot bath\nover knowledge. On James Griffin\u2019s slightly more complex view,\nwell-being consist in the fulfillment of informed desire, and Griffin\npoints out that his view can explain discontinuities in value without\nhaving to appeal to diminishing marginal utility:\n\nthere may well turn out to be cases in which, when informed, I want,\nsay, a certain amount of one thing more than any amount of another,\nand not because the second thing cloys, and so adding to it merely\nproduces diminishing marginal values. I may want it even though the\nsecond thing does not, with addition, lose its value; it may be that I\nthink that no increase in that kind of value, even if constant and\npositive, can overtake a certain amount of this kind of value. (1986,\np. 76).\n\n\nThis version of foundational monism/normative pluralism escapes some\nof the problems that attend the goods approach. First, this view can\naccount for deep complexities in choice. The plural goods that P is\nchoosing between do not seem merely instrumental. Donuts are not good\nbecause they contribute to another value, and P does not desire donuts\nfor any reason other than their donuty nature. On this view, if it is\nhard to choose between donuts and hot baths it is because of the\nintrinsic nature of the objects. The key here is that value is\nconferred by desire, not by contribution to another value. Second,\nthis view can accommodate incomparabilities: if P desires a hot bath\nbecause of its hot bathy nature, and a donut because of its donuty\nnature, she may not be able to choose between them.\n\nHowever, it is not entirely clear that a view like Griffin\u2019s is\ngenuinely monist at the foundational level: the question arises, what\nis constraining the desires that qualify as value conferring? If the\nanswer is \u2018nothing\u2019, then the view seems genuinely monist,\nbut is probably implausible. Unconstrained desire accounts of value\nseem implausible because our desires can be for all sorts of\nthings\u2014we may desire things that are bad for us, or we may\ndesire things because of some mistake we have made. If the answer is\nthat there is something constraining the desires that count as value\nconferring, then of course the question is, \u2018what?\u2019 Is it\nthe values of the things desired? A desire satisfaction view that\nrestricts the qualifying desires must give an account of what\nrestricts them, and obviously, the account may commit the view to\nfoundational pluralism.\n\nGriffin addresses this question at the very beginning of his book on\nwell being (Griffin, 1986,\n ch.2).[10]\n As he puts it,\n\nThe danger is that desire accounts get plausible only by, in effect,\nceasing to be desire accounts. We had to qualify desire with informed,\nand that gave prominence to the features or qualities of the objects\nof desire, and not to the mere existence of desire. (1986, p. 26).\n\n\nGriffin\u2019s account of the relationship between desire and value\nis subtle, and (partly because Griffin himself does not distinguish\nbetween foundational and normative pluralism) it is difficult to say\nwhether his view is foundationally pluralist or not. Griffin argues\nthat it is a mistake to see desire as a blind motivational\nforce\u2014we desire things that we perceive in a favorable light- we\ntake them to have a desirability feature. When we try to explain what\ninvolved in seeing things in a favorable light, we cannot, according\nto Griffin, separate understanding from desire:\n\n\u2026we cannot, even in the case of a desirability feature such as\naccomplishment, separate understanding and desire. Once we see\nsomething as \u2018accomplishment\u2019, as \u2018giving weight and\nsubstance to our lives\u2019, there is no space left for desire to\nfollow along in a secondary subordinate position. Desire is not blind.\nUnderstanding is not bloodless. Neither is the slave of the other.\nThere is no priority. (1986, p. 30)\n\n\nThis suggests that the view is indeed pluralist at the\nfoundation\u2014values are not defined entirely by desire, but partly\nby other features of the situation, and so at the most fundamental\nlevel there is more than one value making feature. Griffin himself\nsays that \u201cthe desire account is compatible with a strong form\nof pluralism about values\u201d (p. 31).\n\nThe question whether or not Griffin is a foundational pluralist is not\npursued further here. The aim in this section is to show first, that\nmonist preference satisfaction accounts of value may have more\ncompelling ways of explaining complexities in value comparison than\nmonist goods approaches, but second, to point out that any constrained\ndesire account may well actually be foundationally pluralist. As soon\nas something is introduced to constrain the desires that qualify as\nvalue conferring, it looks as though another value is operating.\n4. Pluralism and Rational Choice\n\nThe big question facing pluralism is whether rational choices can be\nmade between irreducibly plural values. Irreducible plurality appears\nto imply incommensurability\u2014that is to say, that there is no\ncommon measure which can be used to compare two different values. (See\nthe entry on\n incommensurable values.)\n Value incommensurability seems worrying: if values are\nincommensurable, then either we are forced into an ad hoc ranking, or\nwe cannot rank the values at all. Neither of these are very appealing\noptions.\n\nHowever, pluralists reject this dilemma. Bernard Williams argues that\nit is a mistake to think that pluralism implies that comparisons are\nimpossible. He says:\n\nThere is one motive for reductivism that does not operate simply on\nthe ethical, or on the non-ethical, but tends to reduce every\nconsideration to one basic kind. This rests on an assumption about\nrationality, to the effect that two considerations cannot be\nrationally weighed against each other unless there is a common\nconsideration in terms of which they can be compared. This assumption\nis at once very powerful and utterly baseless. Quite apart from the\nethical, aesthetic considerations can be weighed against economic ones\n(for instance) without being an application of them, and without their\nboth being an example of a third kind of consideration. (Williams\n1985, p. 17)\n\n\nMaking a similar point, Ruth Chang points out that incommensurability\nis often conflated with incomparability. She provides clear\ndefinitions of each: incommensurability is the lack of a common unit\nof value by which precise comparisons can be made. Two items are\nincomparable, if there is no possible relation of comparison, such as\n\u2018better than\u2019, or \u2018as good as\u2019 (1997,\nIntroduction). Chang points out that incommensurability is often\nthought to entail incomparability, but it does not.\n\nDefenders of pluralism have used various strategies to show that it is\npossible to make rational choices between plural values.\n4.1 Practical Wisdom\n\nThe pluralist\u2019s most common strategy in the face of worries\nabout choices between incommensurable values is to appeal to practical\nwisdom\u2014the faculty described by Aristotle\u2014a faculty of\njudgment that the wise and virtuous person has, which enables him to\nsee the right answer. Practical wisdom is not just a question of being\nable to see and collate the facts, it goes beyond that in some\nway\u2014the wise person will see things that only a wise person\ncould see. So plural values can be compared in that a wise person will\n\u2018just see\u2019 that one course of action rather than another\nis to be taken. This strategy is used (explicitly or implicitly) by\nMcDowell (1979), Nagel (1979), Larmore (1987), Skorupski (1996),\nAnderson (1993 and 1997) Wiggins (1997 and 1998), Chappell (1998),\nSwanton (2003). Here it is in Nagel\u2019s words:\n\nProvided one has taken the process of practical justification as far\nas it will go in the course of arriving at the conflict, one may be\nable to proceed without further justification, but without\nirrationality either. What makes this possible is\njudgment\u2014essentially the faculty Aristotle described as\npractical wisdom, which reveals itself over time in individual\ndecisions rather than in the enunciation of general principles. (1979,\np. 135)\n\n\nThe main issue for this solution to the comparison problem is to come\nup with an account of what practical wisdom is. It is not easy to\nunderstand what sort of thing the faculty of judgment might be, or how\nit might work. Obviously pluralists who appeal to this strategy do not\nwant to end up saying that the wise judge can see which of the options\nhas more goodness, as that would constitute collapsing back into\nmonism. So the pluralist has to maintain that the wise judge makes a\njudgment about what the right thing to do is without making any\nquantitative judgment. The danger is that the faculty seems entirely\nmysterious: it is a kind of magical vision, unrelated to our natural\nsenses. As a solution to the comparison problem, the appeal to\npractical wisdom looks rather like way of shifting the problem to\nanother level. Thus the appeal to practical wisdom cannot be left at\nthat. The pluralist owes more explanation of what is involved in\npractical wisdom. What follows below are various pluralists\u2019\naccounts of how choice between plural values is possible, and whether\nsuch choice is rational.\n4.2 Super Scales\n\nOne direction that pluralists have taken is to argue that although\nvalues are plural, there is nonetheless an available scale on which to\nrank them. This scale is not rationalized by something that the values\nhave in common (that would be monism), but by something over and above\nthe values, which is not itself a super value. Williams sometimes\nwrites as if this is his intention, as do Griffin (1986 and 1997),\nStocker (1990), Chang (1997 and 2004), Taylor (1982 and 1997). James\nGriffin (1986) develops this suggestion in his discussion of plural\nprudential values. According to Griffin, we do not need to have a\nsuper-value to have super-scale. Griffin says:\n\n\u2026it does not follow from there being no super-value that there\nis no super-scale. To think so would be to misunderstand how the\nnotion of \u2018quantity\u2019 of well-being enters. It enters\nthrough ranking; quantitative differences are defined on qualitative\nones. The quantity we are talking about is \u2018prudential\nvalue\u2019 defined on informed rankings. All that we need for the\nall-encompassing-scale is the possibility of ranking items on the\nbasis of their nature. And we can, in fact, rank them in that way. We\ncan work out trade-offs between different dimensions of pleasure or\nhappiness. And when we do, we rank in a strong sense: not just choose\none rather than the other, but regard it as worth more. That is the\nultimate scale here: worth to one\u2019s life. (Griffin 1986, p. 90)\n\n\nThis passage is slightly hard to interpret (for more on why see my\nearlier discussion of Griffin in the section on preference\nsatisfaction accounts). On one interpretation, Griffin is in fact\nespousing a sophisticated monism. The basic value is \u2018worth to\none\u2019s life\u2019, and though it is important to talk about\nnon-basic values, such as the different dimensions of pleasure and\nhappiness, they are ultimately judged in terms of their contribution\nto the worth of lives.\n\nThe second possible interpretation takes Griffin\u2019s claim that\nworth to life is not a supervalue seriously. On this interpretation,\nit is hard to see what worth to life is, if not a supervalue. Perhaps\nit is only a value that we should resort to when faced with\nincomparabilities. However, this interpretation invites the criticism\nthat Griffin is introducing a non-moral value, perhaps prudential\nvalue, to arbitrate when moral values are incommensurable. In other\nwords, we cannot decide between incommensurable values on moral\ngrounds, so we should decide on prudential grounds. This seems\nreasonable when applied to incommensurabilities in aesthetic values.\nOne might not be able to say whether Guernica is better than War and\nPeace, but one might choose to have Guernica displayed on the wall\nbecause it will impress one\u2019s friends, or because it is worth\nmore money, or even because one just enjoys it more. In the case of\nmoral choices this is a less convincing strategy: it introduces a\nlevel of frivolity into morality that seems out of place.\n\nStocker\u2019s main strategy is to argue that values are plural, and\ncomparisons are made, so it must be possible to make rational\ncomparisons. He suggests that a \u201chigher level synthesizing\ncategory\u201d can explain how comparisons are made (1990, p. 172).\nAccording to Stocker these comparisons are not quantitative, they are\nevaluative:\n\nSuppose we are trying to choose between lying on a beach and\ndiscussing philosophy\u2014or more particularly, between the pleasure\nof the former and the gain in understanding from the latter. To\ncompare them we may invoke what might be called a higher-level\nsynthesizing category. So, we may ask which will conduce to a more\npleasing day, or to a day that is better spent. Once we have fixed\nupon the higher synthesizing category, we can often easily ask which\noption is better in regard to that category and judge which to choose\non the basis of that. Even if it seems a mystery how we might\n\u2018directly\u2019 compare lying on the beach and discussing\nphilosophy, it is a commonplace that we do compare them, e.g. in\nregard to their contribution to a pleasing day. (Stocker 1990, p. 72)\n\n\nStocker claims that goodness is just the highest level synthesizing\ncategory, and that lower goods are constitutive means to the good.\nRuth Chang\u2019s approach to comparisons of plural values is very\nsimilar (Chang 1997 (introduction) and 2004). Chang claims that\ncomparisons can only be made in terms of a covering value\u2014a more\ncomprehensive value that has the plural values as parts.\n\nA recent suggestion by Brian Hedden and Daniel Munoz is that by\ndefinition, overall value supervenes on the dimensions of value\n(Hedden and Munoz 2023). The basic point is that if overall value is\naffected, then there must be a relevant and distinct way that goodness\nor badness has been contributed. So, for example, in Chang\u2019s\ncase of adding more pleasure disrupting balance (see section 2.1),\nHedden and Munoz argue that balance is a dimension of value, and it is\nbecause balance has been adversely affected that there is less value\noverall.\n\nThere is a problem in understanding quite what a \u2018synthesizing\ncategory\u2019 or \u2018covering value\u2019 is. How does the\ncovering value determine the relative weightings of the constituent\nvalues? One possibility is that it does it by pure\nstipulation\u2014as a martini just is a certain proportion of gin and\nvermouth. However, stipulation does not have the right sort of\nexplanatory power. On the other hand, if a view is to remain\npluralist, it must avoid conflating the super scale with a super\nvalue. Chang argues that her covering values are sufficiently unitary\nto provide a basis for comparison, and yet preserve the separateness\nof the other values. Chang\u2019s argument goes as follows: the\nvalues at stake in a situation (for example, prudence and morality)\ncannot on their own determine how heavily they weigh in a particular\nchoice situation\u2014the values weigh differently depending on the\ncircumstances of the choice. However, the values plus the\ncircumstances cannot determine relevant weightings\neither\u2014because (simplifying here) the internal circumstances of\nthe choice will affect the weighting of the values differently\ndepending on the external circumstances. To use Chang\u2019s own\nexample, when the values at stake are prudence and morality\n(specifically, the duty to help an innocent victim), and the\ncircumstances include the fact that the victim is far away, the effect\nthis circumstance will have on the weighting of the values depends on\nexternal circumstances, which fix what matters in the choice. So, as\nChang puts it, \u201c\u2018What matters\u2019 must therefore have\ncontent beyond the values and the circumstances of the choice\u201d\n(2004, p. 134).\n\nStocker is aware of the worry that appeal to something in terms of\nwhich comparisons can be made reduces the view to monism: Stocker\ninsists that the synthesizing category (such as a good life) is not a\nunitary value\u2014it is at most \u2018nominal monism\u2019 in my\nterminology. Stocker argues that it is a philosophical prejudice to\nthink that rational judgment must be quantitative, and so he claims\nthat he does not need to give an account of how we form and use the\nhigher level synthesizing categories.\n4.3 Basic Preferences\n\nAnother approach to the comparison problem appeals to basic\npreferences. Joseph Raz takes the line that we can explain choice\nbetween irreducibly plural goods by talking about basic preferences.\nRaz approaches the issue of incommensurability by talking about the\nnature of agency and rationality instead of about the nature of value.\nHe distinguishes between two conceptions of human agency: the\nrationalist conception, and the classical conception. The rationalist\nconception corresponds to what we have called the stronger use of the\nterm rational. According to the rationalist conception, reasons\nrequire action. The classical conception, by contrast, \u201cregards\nreasons as rendering options eligible\u201d (Raz 1999, p. 47). Raz\nfavors the classical conception, which regards the will as something\nseparate from desire:\n\nThe will is the ability to choose and perform intentional actions. We\nexercise our will when we endorse the verdict of reason that we must\nperform an action, and we do so, whether willingly, reluctantly, or\nregretting the need, etc. According to the classical conception,\nhowever, the most typical exercise or manifestation of the will is in\nchoosing among options that reason merely renders eligible. Commonly\nwhen we so choose, we do what we want, and we choose what we want,\nfrom among the eligible options. Sometimes speaking of wanting one\noption (or its consequences) in preference to the other eligible ones\nis out of place. When I choose one tin of soup from a row of identical\ntins in the shop, it would be wrong and misleading to say that I\nwanted that tin rather than, or in preference to, the others.\nSimilarly, when faced with unpalatable but unavoidable and\nincommensurate options (as when financial need forces me to give up\none or another of incommensurate goods), it would be incorrect to say\nthat I want to give up the one I choose to give up. I do not want to\ndo so. I have to, and I would equally have regretted the loss of\neither good. I simply choose to give up one of them. (Raz, 1999, p.\n48)\n\n\nRaz\u2019s view about the nature of agency is defended in great\ndetail over the course of many articles, and all of those arguments\ncannot be examined in detail here. What is crucial in the context of\nthis discussion of pluralism is whether Raz gives us a satisfactory\naccount of the weaker sense of rational. Raz\u2019s solution to the\nproblem of incommensurability hangs on the claim that it can be\nrational (in the weak sense) to choose A over B when there are no\nfurther reasons favouring A over B. We shall restrict ourselves to\nmentioning one objection to the view in the context of moral choices\nbetween plural goods. Though Raz\u2019s account of choice may seem\nplausible in cases where we choose between non-moral values, it seems\nto do violence to the concept of morality. Consider one of Raz\u2019s\nown examples, the choice between a banana and a pear. It may be that\none has to choose between them, and there is no objective reason to\nchoose one or the other. In this case, it seems Raz\u2019s account of\nchoice is plausible. If one feels like eating a banana, then in this\ncase, desire does provide a reason. As Raz puts it, \u201cA want can\nnever tip the balance of reasons in and of itself. Rather, our wants\nbecome relevant when reasons have run their course.\u201d In the\nexample where we choose between a banana and a pear, this sounds fine.\nHowever, if we apply it to a moral choice it seems a lot less\nplausible. Raz admits that \u201cIf of the options available to\nagents in typical situations of choice and decision, several are\nincommensurate, then reason can neither determine nor completely\nexplain their choices or actions\u201d (Raz, 1999, p. 48). Thus many\nmoral choices are not directed by reason but by a basic preference. It\nis not fair to call it a desire, because on Raz\u2019s account we\ndesire things for reasons\u2014we take the object of our desire to be\ndesirable. On Raz\u2019s picture then, when reasons have run their\ncourse, we are choosing without reasons. It doesn\u2019t matter\nhugely whether we call that \u2018rational\u2019 (it is not rational\nin the strong sense, but it is in the weak sense). What matters is\nwhether this weak sense of rational is sufficient to satisfy our\nconcept of moral choice as being objectively defensible. The problem\nis that choosing without reasons look rather like plumping. Plumping\nmay be an intelligible form of choice, but it is questionable whether\nit is a satisfactory account of moral choice.\n4.4 Accepting Incomparability\n\nOne philosopher who is happy to accept that there may be situations\nwhere we just cannot make reasoned choices between plural values is\nIsaiah Berlin, who claimed that goods such as liberty and equality\nconflict at the fundamental level. Berlin is primarily concerned with\npolitical pluralism, and with defending political liberalism, but his\nviews about incomparability have been very influential in discussions\non moral pluralism. Bernard Williams (1981), Charles Larmore (1987),\nJohn Kekes (1993), Michael Stocker (1990 and 1997), David Wiggins\n(1997) have all argued that there are at least some genuinely\nirresolvable conflicts between values, and that to expect a rational\nresolution is a mistake. (See also the entry on\n moral dilemmas).\n For Williams this is part of a more general mistake made by\ncontemporary moral philosophers\u2014he thinks that philosophy tries\nto make ethics too easy, too much like arithmetic. Williams insists\nthroughout his writings that ethics is a much more complex and\nmulti-faceted beast than its treatment at the hands of moral\nphilosophers would suggest, and so it is not surprising to him that\nthere should be situations where values conflict irresolvably. Stocker\n(1990) discusses the nature of moral conflict at great length, and\nalthough he thinks that many apparent conflicts can be dissolved or\nare not serious, like Williams, he argues that much of contemporary\nphilosophy\u2019s demand for simplicity is mistaken. Stocker argues\nthat ethics need not always be action guiding, that value is much more\ncomplex than Kantians and utilitarians would have us think, and that\nas the world is complicated we will inevitably face conflicts. Several\npluralists have argued that accepting the inevitability of value\nconflicts does not result in a breakdown of moral argument, but rather\nthe reverse. Kekes (1993), for example, claims that pluralism enables\nus to see that irresolvable disagreements are not due to wickedness on\nthe part of our interlocutor, but may be due to the plural nature of\nvalues.\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe battle lines in the debate between pluralism and monism are not\nalways clear. This entry has outlined some of them, and discussed some\nof the main arguments. Pluralists need to be clear about whether they\nare foundational or non-foundational pluralists. Monists must defend\ntheir claim that there really is a unitary value. Much of the debate\nbetween pluralists and monists has focussed on the issue of whether\nthe complexity of moral choice implies that values really are\nplural\u2014a pattern emerges in which the monist claims to be able\nto explain the appearance of plurality away, and the pluralist insists\nthat the appearance reflects a pluralist reality. Finally, pluralists\nmust explain how comparisons between values are made, or defend the\nconsequence that incommensurability is widespread.\n",
