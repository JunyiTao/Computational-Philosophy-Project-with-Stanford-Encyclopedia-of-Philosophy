    "main_text": "\n\nScientific objectivity is a property of various aspects of science. It\nexpresses the idea that scientific claims, methods, results\u2014and\nscientists themselves\u2014are not, or should not be, influenced by\nparticular perspectives, value judgments, community bias or personal\ninterests, to name a few relevant factors. Objectivity is often\nconsidered to be an ideal for scientific inquiry, a good reason for\nvaluing scientific knowledge, and the basis of the authority of\nscience in society.\n\nMany central debates in the philosophy of science have, in one way or\nanother, to do with objectivity: confirmation and the problem of\ninduction; theory choice and scientific change; realism; scientific\nexplanation; experimentation; measurement and quantification;\nstatistical evidence; reproducibility; evidence-based science;\nfeminism and values in science. Understanding the role of objectivity\nin science is therefore integral to a full appreciation of these\ndebates. As this article testifies, the reverse is true too: it is\nimpossible to fully appreciate the notion of scientific objectivity\nwithout touching upon many of these debates.\n\nThe ideal of objectivity has been criticized repeatedly in philosophy\nof science, questioning both its desirability and its attainability.\nThis article focuses on the question of how scientific objectivity\nshould be defined, whether the ideal of objectivity is\ndesirable, and to what extent scientists can achieve\nit.\n",
