    "main_text": "The structure of loyalty || Universalism and particularism\n3.3 Universalism and particularism\n\nLoyalty is generally seen as involving particularistic, or special,\nobligations to the individual or groups to whom one is loyal and thus\nas a particularistic virtue (as contrasted with, say, the virtue of\nhonesty, which is to be exercized toward all). Although Royce elevated\n\u201cloyalty to loyalty\u201d into a universalistic principle,\nthere has been much debate concerning the relation between\nparticularistic obligations, such as those associated with loyalty and\ngratitude (McConnell, 1983), and universalistic, or general,\nobligations owed to all by virtue of their humanity. Are\nparticularistic obligations subsumable under universalistic ones or\nare they independently derived? If the latter, do they stand in\npermanent tension (obligations to the poor vs. obligations to\none\u2019s children)? How, if at all, are conflicts to be resolved?\nThe discussion has its modern roots in Enlightenment ideas of equal\nrespect and of what is therefore owed to all by virtue of their common\nhumanity. Both consequentialism and Kantian universalism have some\ndifficulty in accommodating virtues such as loyalty, and on occasion\nhave eschewed the latter. As the consequentialist William Godwin\nnotoriously asked: \u201cWhat magic is there in the pronoun\n\u2018my,\u2019 that should justify us in overturning the decisions\nof impartial truth?\u201d (Godwin, 1946, vol. 1, 127).\n\nAlthough most classical theorists have tended to accord moral priority\nto universalistic obligations, there have been important exceptions.\nAndrew Oldenquist has argued for the primacy of certain communal\ndomains defined by our loyalties (\u201call morality is tribal\nmorality\u201d), within which considerations of impartiality may\noperate: \u201cour wide and narrow loyalties define moral communities\nor domains within which we are willing to universalize moral\njudgments, treat equals equally, protect the common good, and in other\nways adopt the familiar machinery of impersonal morality\u201d\n(Oldenquist, 1982, 178, 177; cf. MacIntyre, 1984). Although Oldenquist\ndenies that there is a nontribal, universalist morality, thus seeking\nto deprive the universalist of any independent traction, he does not\ndo much to establish the primacy of the tribal apart, perhaps, from a\ncertain temporal developmental priority.\n\nBernard Williams argued that if the claims of universalism (whether of\nthe consequentialist or Kantian kind) are given pre-eminence, they\nwill alienate people from their \u201cground projects,\u201d where\nthe latter include the deep attachments associated with loyalties.\nWilliams obviously has a point, though even he conceded that such\nprojects are not impervious to universalistic challenges (Williams,\n1981, 17\u201318).\n\nMany systematic moral theorists attempt to subsume particularistic\nobligations such as loyalty under larger universalistic obligations.\nR.M. Hare, for example, adopted a two-tiered consequentialist position\nthat seeks to justify the particularistic obligations of loyalty\nwithin a broader consequentialist schema: we contribute more\neffectively to overall well-being if we foster particularistic\nobligations. Reflecting on the particularism of mother love and\nloyalty, he writes: \u201cIf mothers had the propensity to care\nequally for all the children in the world, it is unlikely that\nchildren would be as well provided for even as they are. The dilution\nof the responsibility would weaken it out of existence\u201d (Hare,\n1981, 137). Unfortunately, simply being aware of the general\nobligation may be sufficient to evacuate the particularistic\nobligation of much of its power\u2014and, indeed, to call it into\nquestion. Moreover, it may overlook the distinctive source of the\nparticularistic obligation\u2014not in the needs of children so much\nas in their being one\u2019s own.\n\nPeter Railton has attempted to find a place for loyalties within a\nbroadly consequentialist framework that avoids both alienation and the\nproblems confronting Hare\u2019s two-tiered system. According to\nRailton, there are good consequentialist reasons for acting on\nparticularistic preferences, consequentialist reasons that do not\nundercut but honor the particularism of those preferences.\nRailton\u2019s defense trades on a distinction between subjective and\nobjective consequentialism, the objective consequentialist (whom he\nsupports) being committed to the course of action available to an\nagent that would maximize the good (Railton, 1984, 152). That, he\nbelieves, does not require that the agent consciously decide to\nmaximize the good\u2014indeed, it may require that the agent not make\nsuch calculations. Overall, then, a loyalty to friends and family, and\ncommitment to ground projects may maximize good, even though, were one\nto make a subjective calculation, it would undermine the loyalty or\ncommitment. Although there is some debate about the success of this\nstrategy (Wilcox, 1987; Conee, 2001), it goes some way to countering\nthe common perception that universalistic (or impersonal) theories can\nfind no place for particularist obligations.\n\nAnother two-tiered system, but of a nonconsequentialist variety, is\nsuggested by Alan Gewirth (1988), who accords primacy to the principle\nthat it is a necessary condition for human agency that all be accorded\nequal rights to freedom and well-being. That commitment, he believes,\nwill also be sufficient to ground special obligations such as those\nfinding expression in personal, familial, and national loyalties. It\nserves as such a ground because the commitment to individual freedom\npermits the formation of voluntary associations, including\n\u201cexclusive\u201d ones, as long as they do not interfere with\nothers\u2019 basic freedom. Such voluntary associations are formed\nnot merely for instrumental purposes, as contributions to our freedom,\nbut are expressive of it. A persisting problem for this account\nconcerns the resolution of conflicts between obligations that arise\nout of our associational commitments (say, to our families) and those\nthat arise directly out of the general principle (say, to assist the\nworld\u2019s needy). This is of course a general problem, and not\njust one for Gewirth; but it raises a question about the success of\nGewirth\u2019s distinctive project, which was to develop a systematic\nalternative to the moral pluralism that he associates with Isaiah\nBerlin, Michael Walzer, and Thomas Nagel.\n\nIt may be that particularistic obligations such as those of loyalty\nhave to be considered as sui generis, products not simply of our\ncommon humanity but of our sociality, of the self-realizing\nsignificance of associational bonds\u2014most particularly\nfriendships, but also various other associational connections that\ncome to be constitutive of our identity and ingredients in our\nflourishing. That leaves, of course, the problem of resolving\nconflicts with universalistic obligations when they occur. We may,\nwith Scheffler, wish to argue that the reasons generated by\nparticularistic associations are \u201cpresumptively decisive\u201d\nin cases in which conflict arises (Scheffler, 1997, 196), though that\nwould need to be integrated in some way with judgments about the value\nto be attributed to particular associations.\n",
