    "main_text": "Why Set Theory? || The Frege-Russell definition of the natural numbers\n1.2 The Frege-Russell definition of the natural numbers\n\nFrege (1884) and Russell (1903) suggested that the simpler concept\n\u201cnatural number\u201d also admits analysis in terms of sets.\nThe simplest application of natural numbers is to count finite sets.\nWe are all familiar with finite collections with 1, 2, 3, \u2026\nelements. Additional sophistication may acquaint us with the empty set\nwith 0 elements.\n\nNow consider the number 3. It is associated with a particular property\nof finite sets: having three elements. With that property it may be\nargued that we may naturally associate an object, the collection of\nall sets with three elements. It seems reasonable to identify this set\nas the number 3. This definition might seem circular (3 is the set of\nall sets with 3 elements?) but can actually be put on a firm,\nnon-circular footing.\n\nDefine 0 as the set whose only element is the empty set. Let \\(A\\) be\nany set; define \\(A + 1\\) as the collection of all sets \\(a \\cup\n\\{x\\}\\) where \\(a \\in A\\) and \\(x \\not\\in a\\) (all sets obtained by\nadding a new element to an element of \\(A)\\). Then \\(0 + 1\\) is\nclearly the set we want to understand as \\(1, 1 + 1\\) is the set we\nwant to understand as \\(2, 2 + 1\\) is the set we want to understand as\n3, and so forth.\n\nWe can go further and define the set \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) of natural\nnumbers. 0 is a natural number and if \\(A\\) is a natural number, so is\n\\(A + 1\\). If a set \\(S\\) contains 0 and is closed under successor, it\nwill contain all natural numbers (this is one form of the principle of\nmathematical induction). Define \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) as the intersection of\nall sets \\(I\\) which contain 0 and contain \\(A + 1\\) whenever \\(A\\) is\nin \\(I\\) and \\(A + 1\\) exists. One might doubt that there is any\ninductive set, but consider the set \\(V\\) of all \\(x\\) such that \\(x =\nx\\) (the universe). There is a formal possibility that \\(V\\) itself is\nfinite, in which case there would be a last natural number \\(\\{V\\}\\);\none usually assumes an Axiom of Infinity to rule out such\npossibilities.\n",
