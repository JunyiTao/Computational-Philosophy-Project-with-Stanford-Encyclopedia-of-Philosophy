    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe extraordinary long life and active teaching career of Albert the\nGreat (c.1193\u20131280) produced many benefits for the inception of\nphilosophy in medieval Germany. Besides the vast corpus of his\nwritings that fostered a generation of Dominican scholars in the\nGerman-speaking province, Albert lived long enough to impart\ncontinuity to this generation, which included Ulrich of\nStra\u00dfburg (c.1225\u20131277), Dietrich of Freiberg\n(1250\u20131310), and Meister Eckhart (c. 1260\u2013c. 1327). All\nof these men made extraordinary contributions to medieval philosophy,\ntheology, and in the case of Dietrich of Freiberg, natural\nscience. However, of all those who were formed in the shadow of\nAlbert, Dietrich showed the most marked tendency to Albert\u2019s\nuniversality of interests.\n",
