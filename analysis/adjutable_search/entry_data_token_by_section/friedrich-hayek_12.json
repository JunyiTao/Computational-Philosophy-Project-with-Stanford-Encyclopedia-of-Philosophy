    "main_text": "Hayek Against Justice || Fair Practices\n5.4 Just Price\n\nWhether we realize gains requires only that we trade, not that we\ntrade at any particular price. Thus, we don\u2019t want to focus on\nprice when the wealth of nations has everything to do with gains from\ntrade and nothing to do with price.\n\nIndeed, Hayek observes, being obsessed with just price would make\ntrading less likely, which would tend to squander some of the\ncooperative surplus. Much of Hayek\u2019s aversion to justice stems\nfrom a sense that (for thousands of years) talk of justice has had a\nway of turning into talk of just price (Hayek 1976, 73). This\nmakes prices appear morally important, which to Hayek is a\n mirage.[13]\n Of Adam Smith\u2019s butchers and bakers, Hayek says,\n\n\nPrecisely because they were interested only in who would offer the\nbest price for their products, they reached persons wholly unknown to\nthem, whose standard of life they thereby enhanced much more than they\ncould have that of their neighbors\u2026 (Hayek 1978b, 60).\n\n\nHayek\u2019s dismissal of social justice as a mirage is a\ngratuitously tendentious way of packaging his actual view. However,\nthe motive for his dismissal is understandable: namely his dread of\nthe prospect of licensing a justice czar to intervene to make sure\nprices are fair, thus derailing the wealth-creating spontaneous\ntrading of a free society within the rule of law. Paraphrasing Michael\nMunger (2013), the closest thing we have to an omniscient social\nplanner are the twin forces of supply and demand, but those forces\nspeak to people through prices. When the state makes it a crime to\ncharge what the market will bear, it can thereby become illegal for\ninsulin users to respond to a power failure by outbidding beer\ndrinkers for insulin-preserving ice as supply runs short. In a case\nlike that, the law has struck dumb the only voice that could give\npeople reliable, timely advice on how resources need to be allocated\nright now. This is Hayek\u2019s ultimate concern throughout his writings,\nand it also underlies his otherwise ill-fitting polemic against social\njustice. To Hayek, it is simply a mirage to think fairness has\nanything to do with stopping the price mechanism from telling us where\nour services are most in need.\n\nHayek never doubts that we sometimes need legislation, but he thinks\nthe aim of legislation should be to make things better, not fairer; to\nmake things more productive, not more level; to channel innovative\nthinking in the direction of wealth creation, not wealth capture.\nHayek in fact endorses norms of pure procedural justice, and would\nagree that there is such a thing, after all, as fairness. True\nfairness, he would say, is about letting players play on a more or\nless level playing field, but he would insist that this is not about\nmaking sure everyone wins their share. Hayek saw a free society as one\nwhere people stand or fall on the basis of how well they perform, not\nhow hard they try\u2014what they produce, not what they intend. \n6. The Austrian School\n\nHayek\u2019s economic education at the University of Vienna was\nwithin the law faculty. Hayek\u2019s degrees were in political\nscience, jurisprudence, and economics. His dissertation work was on\nthe technical topic of the imputation of value in a capital-using\neconomy, and his early professional work focused on monetary theory\nand business cycle statistics. As with other scholars of the Austrian\nSchool of Economics, the institutional framework within which economic\nactivity takes place was never far from the foreground of even the\nmost technical economic analysis. Law, politics, and social mores all\nare critical to the way Austrian economists see economic forces\nplaying out in the real world. \n\nCritical to the Austrian examination of the operation of the\ncompetitive market process is the primacy placed on property rights,\nrelative prices, and profit-and-loss accounting. The emphasis on\ninstitutional infrastructure informed Austrian perspectives on price\ntheory and the market system, on monetary and capital theory, and on\nobstacles to socialist economic planning in particular and to\ninterventionism more generally. To Hayek, the idea of prices without\nproperty is a grand illusion, and efforts to control economic activity\nthrough prohibitions and regulations are plagued by unintended\nconsequences and unforeseen costs.\n\nHayek\u2019s growing frustration with the conversation among elite\neconomists during the 1930s and 1940s was born out his utter surprise\nthat the institutional wisdom passed down from classical political\neconomists to the early neoclassical economists was being lost. He saw\nwanted to know why. He explored the rise of formalism and an emerging\nshift toward macro-theory emphasizing relationships between aggregate\nvariables unconnected to the choices of individuals. To Hayek, these\nshifts were technical in part, but the technicality was masking (and\npartly driven by) a deeper philosophical shift from seeing the human\ncondition as complex as a relatively simple machine that a good\nmechanic could tinker with and perfect. The whole idea of studying the\nhuman condition as a complex spontaneous order came to seem\nunscientific. Thus, in \u201cThe Use of Knowledge in Society\u201d,\nHayek says the maximizing and equilibrium thinking of mathematical\neconomics \u201chabitually disregards\u201d essential parts of the\nphenomena to be explained, and in so doing \u201cmisleads some of our\nleading thinkers\u201d (1944, 91). \n\nThe issue Hayek concerns himself with in The Counter-Revolution of\nScience was the wrong turn in the philosophy and history of ideas that\nconfused the current generation about the nature of the social\nsciences and the institutions of liberalism and the principles of\njustice. His sustained explorations of legal philosophy and political\ntheory sought to counter excessive formalism, excessive aggregation,\nand a na\u00efve empiricism that in his mind conspired to produce the\nintellectual dead-end of scientism: that is, an inappropriate and\nuncritical application of the methods of the natural sciences to the\nproblems of social science. In articulating his critique, Hayek would\nstress over the next several decades the case for methodological\ndualism, and the method and approach for the sciences of complex\nphenomena.\n6.1 Subjectivism\n\nAs a student of the Austrian School of Economics, Hayek was a\nsubjectivist as well as a marginalist in his approach to studying\nhuman decision making. The value of goods and services resides in the\njudgment of the individual chooser, and is not inherent in the goods\nand services themselves. Neither are prices posted in the market\nmerely a summation of costs of production. Value, costs and the\nexpectations of individuals choosers are driven individual buyers and\nsellers assessing tradeoffs. (To give a concrete example, owners of\ngas stations may hike the retail price of gasoline in response to\nbreaking news of a supply problem in the middle east. The news does\nnot affect the price of gas already in their storage tanks, but it\ndoes affect their assessment of what the wholesale price of gasoline\nwill be next time they are buying new supplies so that they can stay\nin business. Retail customers see the hike as gouging because they\ndon\u2019t understand that profit from current sales is what has to\npay for new supplies.) Thus, Hayek\u2019s point in calling the valuation\nprocess subjective is not to say it is a matter of opinion. Rather, it\nis a process of perceiving reality as needing one response rather than\nanother. \n\nEconomic science begins with purposeful human action. And, as social\nscientists we can interpret human action in terms of beliefs, desires\nand intentions. \u201cTo employ a useful metaphor,\u201d Hayek\nargued, \u201cwhile in the world of nature we look from the outside,\nwe look at society from the inside; while, as far as nature is\nconcerned, our concepts are about the facts and have to be adapted to\nthe facts, in the world of society at least some of the most familiar\nconcepts are the stuff from which the world is made\u201d (1948,\n76).\n\nHayek\u2019s mentor, Ludwig Mises, stated the argument as follows in\nhis treatise of economics, Human Action (1949, 92):\n\u201cEconomics is not about things and tangible material objects; it\nis about men, their meanings and actions. Goods, commodities, and\nwealth are all the other notions of conduct are not elements of\nnature; they are elements of human meaning and conduct. He who wants\nto deal with them must not look at the external world; he must search\nfor them in the meaning of acting man.\u201d\n\nA favorite example among Austrian School economists was to imagine a\nscientist from Mars studying patterns in the New York subway Our\nscientific Martian will observe that at 8:00am that there will be\nbodies and boxes, and the boxes will pick up the bodies and move.\nThen, at 5:00pm, those boxes will come back to the same places and\nbodies will leave the boxes. This observer could develop a study of\nmoving boxes and bodies and offer predictions. But can our observer\ntruly understand the phenomena under investigation without reference\nto the purposes and plans of the actors involved, and thus rather than\nseeing boxes and bodies, we come to understand the pattern of action\nassociated with commuting to work. Fritz Machlup tried to capture this\nidea when he penned an essay under the title: \u201cWhat if Matter\nCould Talk?\u201d The social sciences are indeed engaged in\nscientific inquiry, but the subject of study was radically different\nbecause we are what we study.\n6.2 Complexity\n\nIn addition to the uniqueness of the human sciences, the Austrian\nSchool of Economics emphasized the passage of time, the uncertainty\ninherent in human decision making, and the complexity of the economic\norder. The complexity aspect is not new to the Viennese economists,\nbut can be seen in Adam Smith\u2019s discussion at the beginning of\nThe Wealth of Nations of the division of labor and the\nspontaneous far-flung patterns of cooperation required to such mundane\nthings as a worker\u2019s woolen coat. The number of exchanges, Smith\nstates, exceeds all computation. The Austrian School added to this\ncomputational complexity the idea of ceaseless change that requires\nconstant adaptation and adjustment to the shift in circumstances,\nincluding changes in tastes, technology and resource availability. The\nunderstanding of the price theory and the market system from the early\ndevelopment by Menger and Bohm-Bawerk, and the more mature formulation\nin Mises and Hayek argued that a proper understanding of the market\neconomy did not strive to depict the efficiency properties of the\nend-state, but the adaptive and learning aspects of the system. \n\nHayek\u2019s intellectual adversaries shifted in the second half of\nhis career, though of course there are common themes. But the German\nHistoricist and the Collectivist Positivist were no longer the\nanimating force they were in the first half of the 20th century.\nLogical positivism was also transformed. One of the remnants from the\ninfluence of Scientism, however, was in Hayek\u2019s mind a failure\nto address the essential complexity of the social world. As a\nconsequence, his methodological writings in the 1960s and 1970s tend\nto stress not subjectivism and the human sciences, but the differences\nbetween the sciences of simple phenomena and the sciences of essential\ncomplexity.\n6.3 Toward a Science of the Open Society\n\nAgain, Hayek was born in 1899, and born in Vienna. That is to say,\nHayek grew up in a glorious age of Viennese culture only to see it\nevaporate before his eyes with WWI, the Great Depression, the rise of\nsocialism and fascism, WWII, and the Cold War. Hayek fought in WWI. He\nwas among those who left Vienna in the early 1930s never to return. He\nexperienced WWII in his adopted home of Great Britain. Like others of\nhis generation, these experiences were pivotal. He saw totalitarianism\ndistorting science and scholarship, as did two of his philosophical\nfriends: Michael Polanyi and Karl Popper. Despite their differences,\nHayek drew inspiration from and helped promote the work of Polanyi and\nPopper. Totalitarian systems inevitably end up being hostile to the\ncritical attitude at the heart of scientific inquiry. Hayek, Polanyi\nand Popper all saw this in the 1930s and 1940s, and in their separate\nways sought to describe and defend the science of a free society.\n",
