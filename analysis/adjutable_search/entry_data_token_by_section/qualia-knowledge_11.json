She thus has\nacquired a new concept of phenomenal blueness. Using this new\nconcept she can form new beliefs (and acquire new knowledge) about\nphenomenal blueness. Formulated in this way, the view may appear\nsimilar to Conee\u2019s acquaintance account. According to both views,\nMary\u2019s progress consists primarily in getting acquainted with\nphenomenal blueness from an inner perspective. But contrary to Conee\u2019s\nthesis, according to the New Knowledge/Old Fact View, acquaintance\nwith phenomenal blueness from an experiential perspective enables the\nsubject to form a new concept of phenomenal blueness and\nthereby implies the capacity to acquire new beliefs.\n\nAn example of a more explicit theoretical account of phenomenal\ncharacter, phenomenal content and their relation can be found in Tye\n(1995). He proposes a representationalist account of phenomenal\ncharacter. For a state to have phenomenal character is to represent\ninternal or external physical items in an \u2018abstract\u2019 and\nnonconceptual way that is \u201cappropriately poised for use by the\ncognitive system\u201d (see Tye 1995, 137\u2013144). According to\nTye, there are two kinds of phenomenal concepts: indexical concepts\n(an example is the concept applied when thinking of a particular shade\nof red as \u201cthis particular hue\u201d while having a red\nexperience) and what he calls \u201cpredicative phenomenal\nconcepts\u201d that are based on the capacity to make certain\ndiscriminations. Tye wishes to accommodate the natural intuition that\nMary before release cannot fully understand the nature of phenomenal\nblueness (she doesn\u2019t really know what it is to have a blue\nexperience). One might think that his view is incompatible with the\nintuition at issue. Phenomenal blueness, according to his view, has a\nphysical nature and one might expect that physical natures are fully\ndescribable in physical terms and fully understandable under a\nphysical conceptualization. But Tye has a surprising response:\nalthough phenomenal blueness has a physical nature, a person cannot\nfully understand its nature unless she thinks of phenomenal blueness\nunder a phenomenal concept.\n\nAnother representationalist view about phenomenal character is\ncombined with the New Knowledge/Old Fact View in Lycan (1990a) and\n(1996). Lycan\u2019s account of Mary\u2019s epistemic progress can be put,\nroughly, like this: Only after release Mary can form\n\u201cintrospective second order representations\u201d of her own\ncolor experiences. One may think of an introspective representation as\nof \u201ca token in one of the subject\u2019s languages of thought, his or\nher Introspectorese\u201d. It has often been said that what Mary\nlearns is in some sense \u201cineffable\u201d, that it cannot be\ncommunicated in public language. Lycan is led to a similar conclusion\nwithin his computational theory. In his view, when Mary finally has an\nexperience of blue she \u201ctokens a semantically primitive mental\nword for the type of first-order state being inwardly sensed\u201d,\nwhere this word in Mary\u2019s language of thought has an\n\u201cinferential and/or conceptual role\u201d that is \u201cunique\nto its subject, in that no other subject could deploy a functionally\nsimilar representation whose designatum was that (the subject\u2019s) very\nsame first-order state-token, \u2026.\u201d And he concludes that\n\u201cthe introspective word would certainly not be synonymous with\nany primitive or composite expression of public\nEnglish,\u2026\u201d (Lycan 1996, 101).\n\nPapineau (1996) distinguishes third person and first person thoughts\nabout experiences. First person thoughts involve the imagination of an\nexperience of the relevant kind. The basic idea may be put like this:\nWhen Mary is finally released and after some time sufficiently\nacquainted with color experiences she can \u2018reproduce\u2019 blue\nexperiences in her imagination. These imaginations of experiences of a\nparticular kind can be used to refer to experiences of the kind at\nissue and to think about them. Obviously, Mary could not have first\nperson thoughts about color experiences (she could not use imagined\nblue experiences in order to refer and to think about blue\nexperiences) before she ever had blue experiences. After release, Mary\ncan acquire new beliefs: first person beliefs about blue experiences.\nBut for every such new first person belief about a given kind\nof experience, there will be one of her old third person\nbeliefs which refers to the same kind of experience and has the same\nfactual content.\n\nAnother way to understand phenomenal concepts is as a species of\nindexical concepts. For instance, Perry (2001) argues that Mary\u2019s new\nknowledge after release does not pose a problem to physicalism any\nmore than indexical thoughts like \u201cI am a philosopher\u201d or\n\u201ctoday is Sunday\u201d (for a defense of this claim see also\nMcMullen 1985). Perry treats Mary\u2019s new knowledge as a particular case\nof demonstrative belief (and he proposes an account of Mary\u2019s new\nbeliefs after release in terms of his theory of token-reflexive\nthoughts). After release, when seeing the sky, Mary may think\n\u201cOh, so having blue experiences is like this\u201d\nwhere \u201cthis\u201d refers to a physical property (the phenomenal\ncharacter) of her present color experience. She could not have had a\ndemonstrative belief of this kind before release. But, again, the fact\nthat makes the thought true is simply the fact that blue experiences\nhave the particular physical property at issue. Therefore, she does\nnot learn any new fact.\n\nDoubts about Perry\u2019s proposal have been raised along the following\nlines. In normal cases of demonstrative reference the demonstrated\nobject is in some way given to the epistemic subject (when pointing to\na table and referring to it by \u201cthis table\u201d, the object\nmay be given as \u201cthe next table left to me\u201d). But what is\nthe way the kind of experience is given to Mary when she thinks of\nphenomenal blueness under the demonstrative concept \u201cthis kind\nof experience?\u201d It cannot be the way it feels to have an\nexperience with that property, since this solution, so one may argue,\nintroduces phenomenal characters of phenomenal characters and thus\nreintroduces the original problem. Maybe \u201cthe kind of experience\nI am now having\u201d is the appropriate candidate. But there are\nproblems with this proposal too (see Chalmers 2002). There are also\nproblems with suggesting that the demonstrative concept is\n\u2018thin\u2019, in the sense that it has no reference-fixing mode\nof presentation associated with it (for some of these problems see\nDemircioglu 2013, 263\u2013269).\n\nRobert Stalnaker (2008) raises further doubts regarding Perry\u2019s\ntreatment of Mary\u2019s new knowledge. Drawing on a distinction between\nthe two stages of Mary\u2019s epistemic progress (see Section 3.3 above),\nhe argues that the cases of acquiring demonstrative beliefs which\nPerry compares with Mary\u2019s new knowledge are akin to the second\nstage of Mary\u2019s progress, but \u201cIt is at stage one that the\nproblematic cognitive achievement \u2013 the learning \u2018what\nit is like\u2019 to see red \u2013 takes place\u201d (2008,\n44).\n\nStalnaker suggests an alternative way in which Mary\u2019s new knowledge\nis demonstrative in character. On this proposal, what Mary acquires is\nessentially contextual information, where \u201cthe content of what\nis expressed or believed in a context is not detachable from the\ncontext in which it is expressed or believed\u201d (2008, 81). As an\nexample of such information, Stalnaker describes a bomb disposal\nexpert pointing at the ground and saying \u201cA bomb is buried\nthere, and unless we defuse it now it will explode within five\nminutes\u201d (2008, 85). This information, Stalnaker suggests,\ncannot be known by someone who was not in that situation at that time,\neven if they know the exact co-ordinates of where the bomb is located\nand when it will detonate. Daniel Stoljar (2011) argues that\nphenomenal knowledge is not essentially contextual. In defence of this\nclaim, he suggests there is an important dis-analogy between the\ndifference between Mary, pre- and post-release, and the difference\nbetween the bomb disposal expert and anyone who was not with her when\nshe made her utterance. The thought which the bomb disposal expert\nexpressed in her utterance could not even be entertained by someone\nwho was not present at that time; it is for this reason that someone\nnot there could not know what the expert knew. In contrast, Stoljar\nsuggests that \u201cthe fact that post-release Mary learnt could have\nbeen entertained by pre-release Mary (e.g., she can wonder whether it\nobtains)\u201d (2011, 441). This suggests that what Mary learns upon\nrelease is not essentially contextual, at least not in the sense which\nStalnaker has in mind.\n\nAnother worry about demonstrative accounts is that they do not seem to\ndo duty to the way in which the subjective character itself is present\nto the mind of the thinker when employing a phenomenal concept of that\ncharacter. This worry is sometimes put in terms of acquaintance: the\nspecific way in which the thinker is acquainted with the referent of\nher thought in using phenomenal concepts does not seem to be captured\nby the demonstrative account (see Levine 2007; Howell 2007,\n164\u2013166). Several attempts have been made to answer objections\nof this kind. Papineau (2002) and Balog (2012a) argue that the\ncognitive intimacy to be accounted for is well explained by a\nquotational theory of phenomenal concepts: in thoughts involving\nphenomenal concepts token experiences are used in order to refer to\nthe kind those tokens belong to. Levine (2007) argues that even these\nrefined theories do not account for the specific intimate way in which\nthe thinker is related to the referents of phenomenal concepts.\nContrary to this Levin (2007) does not see any need to\n\u2018embellish\u2019 the original simple demonstrative account.\nWhile Balog\u2019s current position is an elaborated version of the\nquotational account, Papineau has abandoned the quotational theory and\nargues in Papineau (2007) that phenomenal concepts are special cases\nof perceptual concepts where perceptual concepts do not involve\ndemonstration.\n\nAn influential view about phenomenal concepts which answers the\nknowledge argument admitting that Mary gains new knowledge but no\nknowledge of new facts is developed in Loar (1990/1997): Phenomenal\nconcepts are recognitional concepts. To have the phenomenal concept of\nblueness is to be able to recognize experiences of blueness while\nhaving them. The recognitional concept of blueness refers\ndirectly to its referent (the physical property of blueness)\nwhere this means (in Loar\u2019s terminology): there is no other\nproperty (no property of that property) involved in the reference\nfixing.  According to Loar\u2019s view the recognitional concept of\nphenomenal blueness refers to the physical property phenomenal\nblueness in virtue of being \u2018triggered\u2019 by that\nproperty. It has been doubted that \u2018directness\u2019 in\nLoar\u2019s sense provides an account for what one might call\nacquaintance: for the way in which the phenomenal character is present\nto the mind when a thinker employs phenomenal concepts (see Levine\n2007). White (2007) argues against Loar that the account cannot\nexplain the a posteriori character of mind-brain identity statements\nin a satisfying manner.\n4.8. Objections Against the New Knowledge/Old Fact View\n\nAn objection to the New Knowledge/Old Fact View can be made as\nfollows. In standard cases, if a subject does not know a given fact in\none way that it does know in some other way, this can be explained by\ntwo modes of presentation: the subject knows the fact under one mode\nof presentation and does not know it under some other mode of\npresentation. So, for example, a person may know the fact that Venus\nis a planet under the mode of presentation associated with \u201cthe\nmorning star is a planet\u201d and fail to know the very same fact\nunder the mode of presentation associated with \u201cthe evening star\nis a planet.\u201d In this particular case, as in many others, the\ndifference in the mode of presentation involves two different\nproperties that are used to fix the referent. In one mode of\npresentation Venus is given as the heavenly body visible late in the\nmorning (or some similar property), whereas in the other mode of\npresentation the object is given as the heavenly body visible early in\nthe evening.\n\nIf the New Knowledge/Old Fact View involves two modes of presentation\nof this sort, then it cannot be used to defend physicalism because\nthis kind of explanation of the supposed double epistemic access to\nfacts concerning phenomenal types would reintroduce non-physical\nproperties at a higher level: the subject would have to be described\nas referring to the phenomenal type at issue by some physical property\nin case it believes the relevant fact under its physical mode of\npresentation and as referring to that phenomenal type by some\nnon-physical property in case it believes the relevant fact under its\nphenomenal mode of presentation.\n\nIt has been argued by several authors that the different modes of\npresentation at issue in the case of beliefs about phenomenal states\ndo involve the introduction of different reference-fixing properties\nand that therefore the proposal is unsuccessful. Arguments of that\nkind are found in Lockwood (1989, chap. 8) and McConnell (1994). White\n(2007) develops the objection in detail. Block (2007) gives a detailed\nanswer to White (2007) based on a distinction between what he labels\ncognitive and metaphysical modes of presentation. Chalmers (1996,\n2002, 2010) makes a similar point as White (2007) using his framework\nof primary and secondary intensions. In that framework, primary\nintensions describe the way a concept picks out its referent in the\nactual world and the cognitive independence of phenomenal and physical\nconcepts is explained by their different primary intensions. If one\nsingular fact can be known under a physical mode of presentation as\nwell as under a phenomenal mode of presentation, then the two items of\nknowledge involve two concepts (a phenomenal and a physical concept)\nwith different primary intensions and these different primary\nintensions correspond to different properties.\n\nA two-dimensional framework is used in a different manner in\nNida-R\u00fcmelin (2007) to develop the idea that the nature of\nphenomenal properties is present to the mind of the thinker when using\nphenomenal properties \u2013 an idea which leads to the result that the\nNew Knowledge/Old Fact View is mistaken. This idea is also suggested\nby Philip Goff (2017). He suggests that the knowledge argument does\nnot by itself refute physicalism because it does not overcome the New\nKnowledge/Old Fact View. However, things are different if the\nphenomenal concept which Mary acquires is transparent (i.e.,\nit reveals the nature or essence of the phenomenal property which\nsatisfies it):\n\nin this case Mary\u2019s new knowledge is knowledge of the nature of red\nexperiences, but if pure physicalism is true, she already knew the\ncomplete nature of red experiences in knowing the pure physical\ntruths, and hence there ought to be nothing more she can learn about\ntheir nature (2017, 74\u201375; see also F\u00fcrst 2011,\n69\u201370; Demircioglu 2013, 274\u2013275).\n\n\nA general argument against the materialist strategy of appealing to\nphenomenal concepts is developed in Chalmers (2004; 2007); for\ncritical discussion see Balog (2012b). \n\nAnyone who wishes to argue in the way just mentioned, that the two\nmodes of presentation do involve the introduction of two different\nreference-fixing properties, must deal with Loar\u2019s proposal (see 4.7).\nLoar avoids the problem of two reference fixing properties by his\nclaim that phenomenal concepts refer directly to their referent. It\nhas been argued against Loar that his causal account of how phenomenal\nconcepts manage to directly refer to their referent (namely by being\ntriggered by them) cannot appropriately describe the particular\ncognitive role of phenomenal concepts (see McConnell 1994 and White\n2007).\n\nA final issue concerning both the New Knowledge/Old Facts View and the\nknowledge argument itself is whether there are any phenomenal\nconcepts. Derek Ball (2009) and Michael Tye (2009) argue that there\nare no such concepts, at least as defined above: in particular, both\ndeny claim (4) outlined in Section 4.6, that a subject can possess\nphenomenal concepts only if it has or has had experiences of the\nrelevant kind. Ball and Tye appeal to work on social externalism\nregarding the content of our concepts to argue that even prior to her\nrelease, Mary possesses the same concepts which she uses to think\nabout her experiences after her release. Specifically, she possesses\nsuch concepts \u2018deferentially\u2019, in virtue of interacting\nwith her linguistic community; a crucial part of social externalism\nabout content is that one can possess concepts deferentially even\nthough one is largely ignorant of the nature of what satisfies these\nconcepts (Ball 2009, 947\u2013954; Tye 2009,\n 63\u201370).[6]\n This result threatens to undermine the New Knowledge / Old Facts\nView, but Ball suggests it also undermines the knowledge argument\nitself, since the knowledge argument itself depends on there being\nphenomenal concepts (2009, 940\u2013943).\n\nTorin Alter (2013) responds to these arguments by focusing on the\ndistinction between deferential and non-deferential concept possession\n(the latter is conceptual mastery). He suggests that it is\nmastery of phenomenal concepts rather than mere deferential possession\nwhich matters for the knowledge argument: \u201cMary makes epistemic\nprogress when she leaves the room because she comes to master or\nnon-deferentially possess phenomenal colour concepts\u201d (2013,\n486). And defenders of the knowledge argument can claim that mastery\nof a phenomenal concept requires actually having experiences with the\nrelevant phenomenal character.\n4.9 The Knowledge Argument and Objectivism\n\nThe Knowledge Argument has traditionally been understood as an\nargument against physicalism or perhaps against reductive versions of\nphysicalism. But an influential alternative approach sees the argument\nas working not against physicalism per se, but against a different\nposition which can be termed\n objectivism.[7]\n Objectivism is the view that an objective description of what exists\ncan be complete; that there are no aspects of reality which can only\nbe understood by having experiences of a specific type. This notion is\nclosely related to Nagel\u2019s characterization of the physical nature\nof organisms as \u201ca domain of objective facts par\nexcellence \u2013 the kind that can be observed and understood\nfrom many points of view and by individuals with differing perceptual\nsystems\u201d (1974, 442). On this view, the point of Jackson\u2019s\nthought experiment is to bring out that Mary learns something which\ncan only be known by having an experience of a certain kind (e.g., a\nperceptual experience). If this is correct, then this shows that no\nobjective description of what exist can be complete. As Howell\nformulates it, the argument understood in this way runs as\nfollows:\n\nbefore leaving the room, Mary knew all the objective information about\nthe world. When she left the room, she gained further understanding\nabout the world. Therefore, all the objective information about the\nworld is insufficient for a complete understanding of the world (2007,\n147).\n\n\nA number of proponents of this interpretation of the Knowledge\nArgument suggest that it is compatible with a specific form of\nphysicalism, on which all facts are physical or metaphysically\nnecessitated by microphysical facts but some facts can only be\nunderstood by having specific experiences (see, e.g., Kallestrup 2006;\nHowell 2007; for slightly different formulations see Crane 2003; Zhao\n2012). That said, it is worth asking how the \u2018physical\u2019 is\nto be understood, such that facts which can only be known if one has\ncertain experiences can count as physical. Furthermore, it is worth\nquestioning whether a view on which facts are either physical or\nmetaphysically necessitated by microphysical facts thereby counts as a\nform of physicalism. It has been argued that such a view is compatible\nwith non-physicalist positions such as emergentism or certain forms of\nethical non-naturalism (see Horgan 1993, 559-566; 2010, 311-314; Crane\n2010; for discussion see Stoljar 2017, section 9).\n5. The Dualist View About the Knowledge Argument\n\nThere has not been much discussion of the knowledge argument from a\ndualist perspective. This is unsurprising given the small number of\ncontemporary philosophers who defend a dualist position (for a\nprominent exception see Chalmers (1996); the knowledge argument is\ndiscussed on pp. 140\u2013146). There are two possible strategies for\na dualist to take who wishes to defend the knowledge argument. The\nfirst is merely defensive or \u2018destructive\u2019 in that it\ntries to refute the positive theoretical proposals one by one that\nhave been used by physicalists in their objections against the\nknowledge argument. The second is more \u2018constructive\u2019 in\nthat it aims at developing an alternative positive dualist account of\nphenomenal concepts, phenomenal properties and their relations such\nthat on that account Mary does learn new and nonphysical facts upon\nrelease. Examples (or partial examples) for the first strategy may\noccasionally be found in the literature (compare Warner 1986, Gertler\n1999, Raymont 1995, 1999 and Connell 1994). Examples for the second\nare hard to find, but Chalmers (1996, 2002) and Nida-R\u00fcmelin\n(2007) exemplify the second strategy. Using his framework of primary\nand secondary intensions he develops a positive account of what he\ncalls \u201cpure phenomenal concepts\u201d that can be described as\nincorporating the old and natural intuition that in the case of qualia\n(phenomenal characters) there is no distinction between appearance and\nreality, in other words: qualia \u2018reveal their nature\u2019 in\nexperience.\n\nThe intuitive idea just mentioned has been expressed in different\nways. Some say that qualia \u2018have no hidden sides\u2019. Others\nsay that qualia are not natural kind terms in that it is not\nup to the sciences to tell us what having an experience of a\nparticular kind amounts to (we know what it amounts to by having them\nand attending to the quality at issue). It is quite clear that an\naccount of this intuitive idea has to be one of the ingredients of a\ndualist defense of the knowledge argument. Nida-R\u00fcmelin (2007)\ndevelops a technical notion of grasping properties which is intended\nto serve the purposes of dualists who argue against materialism using\nthe assumption that in the special case of phenomenal concepts the\nrelation that the thinker bears to the property he conceptualizes is\nmore intimate than in other cases: the thinker understands what having\nthe property essentially consists in. This idea can be used to block\nfamiliar objections to the knowledge argument in particular those\nfalling into the Old fact/ New Knowledge category. A similar basic\nidea but formulated within a different theoretical framework is\nelaborated in Stephen White (2007). \n\nAccording to mainstream opinion the most serious problem for property\ndualism is the danger of being driven into epiphenomenalism. If\nphenomenal characters are non-physical properties and if every\nphysical event has a physical cause and if we exclude the possibility\nof overdetermination (where something is caused by two different\ncauses that are both sufficient), then, arguably, whether or not a\nstate has a particular phenomenal character cannot have any causal\nrelevance. But if qualia are causally impotent, how can a person know\nthat she has an experience with a particular phenomenal character?\nMany take it to be obvious that a person cannot know that she now has\na blue experience unless her blue experience plays a prominent causal\nrole in the formation of her belief at issue. This particular problem\nhas been formulated as an objection against the knowledge argument in\nWatkins (1989). Until some time ago Jackson was one of the very few\nphilosophers who embraced epiphenomenalism. But Jackson changed his\nmind. Jackson (1995) argues that knowledge about qualia is impossible\nif qualia are epiphenomenal and he concludes that something must be\nwrong with the knowledge argument. In Jackson (2003) and Jackson\n(2007) he argues that the argument goes wrong in presupposing a false\nview about sensory experience and that it can be answered by endorsing\nstrong representationalism: the view that to be in a phenomenal state\nis to represent objective properties where the properties represented\nas well as the representing itself can be given a physicalist account.\nJackson admits that there is a specific phenomenal way of representing\nbut he now insists that the phenomenal way of representing can be\naccounted for in physicalist terms. Doubts about the latter claim are\ndeveloped in Alter (2007). Other possible reactions to the threat of\nepiphenomenalism for dualism would be either to doubt that a property\ndualist must embrace epiphenomenalism or to develop an account of\nknowledge about one\u2019s own phenomenal states that does not imply a\ncausal relation between qualia and phenomenal knowledge about qualia\n(see Chalmers 2002).\n6. Concluding Remark\n\nThe appropriate evaluation of the knowledge argument remains\ncontroversial. The acceptability of its second premise P2 (Mary lacks\nfactual knowledge before release) and of the inferences from P1 (Mary\nhas complete physical knowledge before release) to C1 (Mary knows all\nthe physical facts) and from P2 to C2 (Mary does not know some facts\nbefore release) depend on quite technical and controversial issues\nabout (a) the appropriate theory of property concepts and their\nrelation to the properties they express and (b) the appropriate theory\nof belief content. It is therefore safe to predict that the discussion\nabout the knowledge argument will not come to an end in the near\nfuture.",
