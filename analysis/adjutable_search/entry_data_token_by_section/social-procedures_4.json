    "main_text": "Fairness || Solomon\u2019s Judgement\n2.3 Solomon\u2019s Judgement\n\nA variation on Divide and choose was played by\nKing Solomon in the famous Judgement of Solomon, in a dispute among\ntwo women who both claimed to be the mother of a child. The full story\nis in 1 Kings 3:16\u201328. Two women who lived in the same house\nboth had an infant son. One of the women claimed that the other woman\nhad stolen her child, after accidentally smothering her own son during\nsleep. The other woman denied this and reversed the charge. After\nhearing their stories, King Solomon called for a sword and declared\nthat there was only one fair solution: cut the living child in two and\ngive both women half of it. Upon hearing this, the true mother cried\nout that she was willing to give up the child if it could be spared,\nwhile the fake mother agreed with the judgement. This behaviour\nrevealed to Solomon who was the real mother, and her child was given\nback to her.\n\nThis procedure is not repeatable. As the Bible story puts it:\n\n\nAnd all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and\nthey feared the king; for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him,\nto do justice.\n\n\nObviously, in a second similar dispute, both women would exclaim\n\u201cGive it to her, but let it live!\u201d\n\nSolomon\u2019s handling of the situation can be turned into a social\nprocedure that is repeatable, as follows. Solomon does not call for a\nsword, but instead explains to the two women the following procedure.\nFirst he is going to ask the first woman if she is willing to give up\nthe child. If the answer is \u201cyes\u201d, the dispute is\nresolved, with no further questions asked. Otherwise he will ask the\nother woman if she is willing to give up the child. Again, if the\nanswer is \u201cyes\u201d the dispute is resolved. If they both\nrefuse, then the child is his, and then he will allow one of the women\nto buy it back, at a price that is to be determined as follows. They\nwill both write an amount of money on a sheet of paper, without their\nnames. If the two bids are \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), then the price of the\nchild is set at \\(\\frac{A + B}{2}\\), and fate will determine which\nwoman is going to get the child at that price, where the other woman\nhas to pay a small fine. If the two women are rational, one of them\nwill give up the child when being first asked (see Moore\n1992 and Pauly 2005; for philosophical\ndiscussions of rationality, see the entries on\n practical reason\n &\n game theory and ethics).\n\nBoth Moore (1992) and Pauly (2005)\ndiscuss the importance of reasoning\nabout common knowledge and ignorance in the King Solomon cases. For\nexample, King Solomon is ignorant of who is the real mother, but both\nwomen commonly know from the start who is the true mother, and that\nthe true mother will therefore bid much higher than the other one.\nThis makes the procedure safe. Again, epistemic logic and in\nparticular common knowledge help to shed light on a tricky social\nprocedure. For a more traditionally philosophical introduction to the\nfair division problem, including more extensive explanations of\nfairness, manipulability and envy-freeness, see the entry on\n economics [normative] and economic justice.\n\nThe next section shows that the perspective of social software can\nalso shed light on social matching problems. These range from\nmarriages to the assignment of resident doctors to hospitals, college\nadmission procedures, and the assignment of students to housing.\n",
