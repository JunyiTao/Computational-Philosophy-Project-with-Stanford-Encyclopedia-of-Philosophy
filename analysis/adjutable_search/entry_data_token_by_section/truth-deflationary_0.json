    "main_text": "Central Themes in Deflationism || The Equivalence Schema\n1.1 The Equivalence Schema\n\nWhile deflationism can be developed in different ways, it is possible\nto isolate some central themes emphasized by most philosophers who\nthink of themselves as deflationists. These shared themes pertain to\nendorsing a kind of metaphysical parsimony and positing a\n\u201cdeflated\u201d role for what we can call the alethic\nlocutions (most centrally, the expressions \u2018true\u2019 and\n\u2018false\u2019) in the instances of what is often called\ntruth-talk. In this section, we will isolate three of these\nthemes. The first, and perhaps most overarching, one has already been\nmentioned: According to deflationists, there is some strong\nequivalence between a statement like \u2018snow is white\u2019 and a\nstatement like \u201c\u2018snow is white\u2019 is true,\u201d and\nthis is all that can significantly be said about that application of\nthe notion of truth.\n\nWe may capture this idea more generally with the help of a schema,\nwhat is sometimes called the equivalence schema:\n\n(ES)\n\\(\\langle p\\rangle\\) is true if, and only if, \\(p\\).\n\n\nIn this schema, the angle brackets indicate an appropriate\nname-forming or nominalizing device, e.g., quotation marks or\n\u2018the proposition that \u2026\u2019, and the occurrences of\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 are replaced with matching declarative sentences\nto yield instances of the schema.\n\nThe equivalence schema is often associated with the formal work of\n Alfred Tarski\n (1935 [1956], 1944), which introduced the schema,\n\n(T)\n\\(X\\) is true if, and only if, \\(p\\).\n\n\nIn the instances of schema (T) (sometimes called \u201cConvention\n(T)\u201d), the \u2018\\(X\\)\u2019 gets filled in with a name of the\nsentence that goes in for the \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019, making (T) a\nversion of (ES). Tarski considered (T) to provide a criterion of\nadequacy for any theory of truth, thereby allowing that there could be\nmore to say about truth than what the instances of the schema cover.\nGiven that, together with the fact that he took the instances of (T)\nto be contingent, his theory does not qualify as deflationary.\n\nBy contrast with the Tarskian perspective on (T)/(ES), we can\nformulate the central theme of deflationism under consideration as the\nview, roughly, that the instances of (some version of) this schema do\ncapture everything significant that can be said about applications of\nthe notion of truth; in a slogan, the instances of the schema\nexhaust the notion of truth. Approaches which depart from\ndeflationism don\u2019t disagree that (ES) tells us something about\ntruth; what they (with Tarski) deny is that it is exhaustive, that it\ntells us the whole truth about truth. Since such approaches add\nsubstantive explanations of why the instances of the equivalence\nschema hold, they are now often called inflationary\napproaches to truth. Inflationism is the general approach shared by\nsuch traditional views as the\n correspondence theory of truth,\n coherence theory of truth,\n pragmatic theory of truth,\n identity theory of truth, and primitivist theory of truth, These theories all share\na collection of connected assumptions about the alethic locutions, the\nconcept of truth, and the property of truth. Inflationary theories all\nassume that the expression \u2018is true\u2019 is a descriptive\npredicate, expressing an explanatory concept of truth, which\ndetermines a substantive property of truth. From that shared set of\npresuppositions, the various traditional inflationary theories then\ndiverge from one another by providing different accounts of the\nassumed truth property. On inflationary views, the nature of the truth\nproperty explains why the instances of (ES) hold. Deflationary views,\nby contrast, reject some if not all of the standard assumptions that\nlead to inflationary theories, resisting at least their move to\npositing any substantive truth property. Instead, deflationists offer\na different understanding of both the concept of truth and the\nfunctioning of the alethic locutions. A deflationist will take the\ninstances of (ES) to be \u201cconceptually basic and explanatorily\nfundamental\u201d (Horwich 1998a, 21, n. 4; 50), or to be direct\nconsequences of how the expression \u2018true\u2019 operates (cf.\nQuine 1970 [1986], Brandom 1988, and Field 1994a).\n\nIt is important to notice that even among deflationists the\nequivalence schema may be interpreted in different ways, and this is\none way to distinguish different versions of deflationism from one\nanother. One question about (ES) concerns the issue of what instances\nof the schema are assumed to be about (equivalently: to what the names\nin instances of (ES) are assumed to refer). According to one view, the\ninstances of this schema are about sentences, where a name for a\nsentence can be formulated simply by putting quotation marks around\nit. In other words, for those who hold what might be called a\nsententialist version of deflationism, the equivalence schema\nhas instances like (1):\n\n(1)\n\u2018Brutus killed Caesar\u2019 is true if, and only if, Brutus\nkilled Caesar.\n\n\nTo make this explicit, we might say that, according to sententialist\ndeflationism, the equivalence schema is:\n\n(ES-sent)\nThe sentence \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is true if, and only if,\n\\(p\\).\n\n\nNotice that in this schema, the angle-brackets of (ES) have been\nreplaced by quotation marks.\n\nAccording to those who hold what might be called a\npropositionalist version of deflationism, by contrast,\ninstances of the equivalence schema are about propositions, where\nnames of propositions are, or can be taken to be, expressions of the\nform \u2018the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019, where\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is filled in with a declarative sentence. For the\npropositionalist, in other words, instances of the equivalence schema\nare properly interpreted not as being about sentences but instead as\nbeing about propositions, i.e., as biconditionals like (2) rather than\n(1):\n\n(2)\nThe proposition that Brutus killed Caesar is true if, and only if,\nBrutus killed Caesar.\n\n\nTo make this explicit, we might say that, according to\npropositionalist deflationism, the equivalence schema is:\n\n(ES-prop)\nThe proposition that \\(p\\) is true if, and only if, \\(p\\).\n\n\nInterpreting the equivalence schema as (ES-sent) rather than as\n(ES-prop), or vice versa, thus yields different versions of\ndeflationism, sententialist and propositionalist versions,\nrespectively.\n\nAnother aspect that different readings of (ES) can vary across\nconcerns the nature of the equivalence that its instances assert. On\none view, the right-hand side and the left-hand side of such instances\nare synonymous or analytically equivalent. Thus, for sententialists\nwho endorse this level of equivalence, (1) asserts that,\n\u201c\u2018Brutus killed Caesar\u2019 is true\u201d means just\nwhat \u2018Brutus killed Caesar\u2019 means; while for\npropositionalists who endorse analytic equivalence, (2) asserts that\n\u2018the proposition that Brutus killed Caesar is true\u2019 means\nthe same as \u2018Brutus killed Caesar\u2019. A second view is that\nthe right-hand and left-hand sides of claims such as (1) and (2) are\nnot synonymous but are nonetheless necessarily equivalent; this view\nmaintains that the two sides of each equivalence stand or fall\ntogether in every possible world, despite having different meanings.\nAnd a third possible view is that claims such as (1) and (2) assert\nonly a material equivalence; this view interprets the \u2018if and\nonly if\u2019 in both (1) and (2) as simply the biconditional of\nclassical logic.\n\nThis tripartite distinction between analytic, necessary, and material\nequivalence, when combined with the distinction between sententialism\nand propositionalism, yields six different possible (although not\nexhaustive) readings of the instances of (ES):\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSentential\nPropositional  \n\n\nAnalytic\n\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) \n\nNecessary\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{D}\\) \n\nMaterial\n\\(\\mathbf{E}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{F}\\)  \n\n\nWhile different versions of deflationism can be correlated to some\nextent with different positions in this chart, some chart positions\nhave also been occupied by more than one version of deflationism. The\nlabels \u2018redundancy theory\u2019, \u2018disappearance\ntheory\u2019 and \u2018no-truth theory\u2019 have been used to\napply to analytic versions of deflationism: positions \\(\\mathbf{A}\\)\nor \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). But there is a sense in which position\n\\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is also occupied by versions of what is called\n\u201cdisquotationalism\u201d (although the most prominent\ndisquotationalists tend to be leary of the notions of analyticity or\nsynonymy), and what is called \u201cprosententialism\u201d also\nposits an equivalence of what is said with the left- and right-hand\nsides of the instances of (ES). The latter version of deflationism,\nhowever, does this without making the left-hand sides about sentences\nnamed via quotation or about propositions understood as abstract\nentities. No deflationist has offered an account occupying position\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\), \\(\\mathbf{E}\\), or \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) (although the\nexplicit inspiration some disquotationalists have found in\nTarski\u2019s work and his deployment of material equivalence might\nmisleadingly suggest position \\(\\mathbf{E})\\). Paul Horwich (1998a)\nuses the label \u2018minimalism\u2019 for a version of\npropositionalist deflationism that takes the instances of (ES-prop) to\ninvolve a necessary equivalence, thereby occupying position\n\\(\\mathbf{D}\\). To a large extent, philosophers prefer one or another\n(or none) of the positions in the chart on the basis of their views\nfrom other parts of philosophy, typically their views about the\nphilosophy of language and metaphysics.\n",
