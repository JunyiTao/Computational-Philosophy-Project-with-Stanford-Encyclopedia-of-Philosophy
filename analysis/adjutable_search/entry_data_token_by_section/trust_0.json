    "main_text": "The Nature of Trust and Trustworthiness\n1. The Nature of Trust and Trustworthiness\n\nTrust is an attitude we have towards people whom we hope will be\ntrustworthy, where trustworthiness is a property not an attitude.\nTrust and trustworthiness are therefore distinct although, ideally,\nthose whom we trust will be trustworthy, and those who are trustworthy\nwill be trusted. For trust to be plausible in a relationship, the\nparties to the relationship must have attitudes toward one another\nthat permit trust. Moreover, for trust to be well-grounded, both\nparties must be trustworthy. (Note that here and throughout, unless\nspecified otherwise, \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d is understood in a\nthin sense according to which X is trustworthy for me just in\ncase I can trust X.)\n\nTrusting requires that we can, (1) be vulnerable to\nothers\u2014vulnerable to betrayal in particular; (2) rely on others\nto be competent to do what we wish to trust them to do; and (3) rely\non them to be willing to do\n it.[2]\n Notice that the second two conditions refer to a connection between\ntrust and reliance. For most philosophers, trust is a kind of reliance\nalthough it is not mere reliance (Goldberg 2020). Rather,\ntrust involves reliance \u201cplus some extra factor\u201d (Hawley\n2014: 5). Controversy surrounds this extra factor, which generally\nconcerns why the trustor (i.e., the one trusting) would rely on the\ntrustee to be willing to do what they are trusted to do.\n\nTrustworthiness is likewise a kind of reliability, although it\u2019s\nnot obvious what kind. Clear conditions for trustworthiness are that\nthe trustworthy person is competent and willing to do what they are\ntrusted to do. Yet this person may also have to be willing for certain\nreasons or as a result of having a certain kind of motive for acting\n(e.g., they care about the trustor).\n\nThis section explains these various conditions for trust and\ntrustworthiness and highlights the controversy that surrounds the\ncondition about motive and relatedly how trust differs from mere\nreliance. Included at the end is some discussion about the nature of\ndistrust.\n\nLet me begin with the idea that the trustor must accept some level of\nvulnerability or risk (Becker 1996; Baier 1986). Minimally, what this\nperson risks, or is vulnerable to, is the failure by the trustee to do\nwhat the trustor is depending on them to do. The trustor might try to\nreduce this risk by monitoring or imposing certain constraints on the\nbehavior of the trustee; but after a certain threshold perhaps, the\nmore monitoring and constraining they do, the less they trust this\nperson. Trust is relevant \u201cbefore one can monitor the actions of\n\u2026 others\u201d (Dasgupta 1988: 51) or when out of respect for\nothers one refuses to monitor them. One must be content with them\nhaving some discretionary power or freedom, and as a result, with\nbeing somewhat vulnerable to them (Baier 1986; Dasgupta 1988).\n\nOne might think that if one is relying while trusting\u2014that is,\nif trust is a species of reliance\u2014then accepted vulnerability\nwould not be essential for trust. Do we not rely on things only when\nwe believe they will actually happen? And if we believe that, then we\ndon\u2019t perceive ourselves as being vulnerable. Many philosophers\nwriting on trust and reliance say otherwise. They endorse the view of\nRichard Holton, who writes, \u201cWhen I rely on something happening\n\u2026 I [only] need to plan on it happening; I need to work around\nthe supposition that it will [happen]\u201d (Holton 1994: 3). I need\nnot be certain of it happening and I could even have doubts that it\nwill happen (Goldberg 2020). I could therefore accept that I am\nvulnerable. I could do that while trusting if trust is a form of\nreliance.\n\nWhat does trusting make us vulnerable to, in particular? Annette Baier\nwrites that \u201ctrusting can be betrayed, or at least let down, and\nnot just disappointed\u201d (1986: 235). In her view, disappointment\nis the appropriate response when one merely relied on someone to do\nsomething but did not trust them to do it. To elaborate, although\npeople who monitor and constrain others\u2019 behavior may rely on\nthem, they do not trust them if their reliance can only be\ndisappointed rather than betrayed. One can rely on inanimate objects,\nsuch as alarm clocks, but when they break, one is not betrayed though\none might be disappointed. This point reveals that reliance without\nthe possibility of betrayal (or at least \u201clet down\u201d) is\nnot trust; people who rely on one another in a way that makes this\nreaction impossible do not trust one another.\n\nBut does trust always involve the potential for betrayal?\n\u201cTherapeutic trust\u201d may be an exception (Nickel 2007: 318;\nand for further exceptions, see, e.g., Hinchman 2017). To illustrate\nthis type of trust, consider parents who\n\n\ntrust their teenagers with the house or the family car, believing that\ntheir [children] may well abuse their trust, but hoping by such trust\nto elicit, in the fullness of time, more responsible and responsive\ntrustworthy behaviour. (McGeer 2008: 241, her emphasis; see also\nHorsburgh 1960 and Pettit 1995)\n\n\nTherapeutic trust is not likely to be betrayed rather than merely be\ndisappointed. It is unusual in this respect (arguably) and in other\nrespects that will become evident later on in this entry. The rest of\nthis section deals with usual rather than unusual forms of trust and\ntrustworthiness.\n\nWithout relying on people to display some competence, we also\ncan\u2019t trust them. We usually trust people to do certain things,\nsuch as look after our children, give us advice, or be honest with us,\nwhich we wouldn\u2019t do that if we thought they lacked the relevant\nskills, including potentially moral skills of knowing what it means to\nbe honest or caring (Jones 1996: 7). Rarely do we trust people\ncompletely (i.e., A simply trusts B). Instead,\n\u201ctrust is generally a three-part relation: A trusts\nB to do X\u201d (Hardin 2002: 9)\u2014or\n\u201cA trusts B with valued item C\u201d\n(Baier 1986) or A trusts B in domain D\n(D\u2019Cruz 2019; Jones\n 2019).[3]\n To have trust in a relationship, we do not need to assume that the\nother person will be competent in every way. Optimism about the\nperson\u2019s competence in at least one area is essential,\nhowever.\n\nWhen we trust people, we rely on them not only to be competent to do\nwhat we trust them to do, but also to be willing or motivated to do\nit. We could talk about this matter either in terms of what the\ntrustor expects of the trustee or in terms of what the trustee\npossesses: that is, as a condition for trust or for trustworthiness\n(and the same is true, of course, of the competence condition). For\nsimplicity\u2019s sake and to focus some of this section on\ntrustworthiness rather than trust, the following refers to the\nmotivation of the trustee mostly as a condition for\ntrustworthiness.\n\nAlthough both the competence and motivational elements of\ntrustworthiness are crucial, the exact nature of the latter is\nunclear. For some philosophers, it matters only that the trustee is\nmotivated, where the central problem of trustworthiness in their view\nconcerns the probability that this motivation will exist or endure\n(see, e.g., Hardin 2002: 28; Gambetta 1988b). Jones calls these\n\u201crisk-assessment views\u201d about trust (1999: 68). According\nto them, we trust people whenever we perceive that the risk of relying\non them to act a certain way is low and so we rely on (i.e.,\n\u201ctrust\u201d) them. They are trustworthy if they are willing,\nfor whatever reason, to do what they are trusted to do.\nRisk-assessment theories make no attempt to distinguish between trust\nand mere reliance and have been criticized for this reason (see, e.g.,\nJones 1999).\n\nBy contrast, other philosophers say that just being motivated to act\nin the relevant way is not sufficient for trustworthiness; according\nto them, the nature of the motivation matters, not just its existence\nor duration. It matters in particular, they say, for explaining the\ntrust-reliance distinction, which is something they aim to do. The\ncentral problem of trustworthiness for them is not simply whether but\nalso how the trustee is motivated to act. Will that person have the\nkind of motivation that makes trust appropriate? Katherine Hawley\nidentifies theories that respond to this question as\n\u201cmotives-based\u201d theories (2014).\n\nTo complicate matters, there are \u201cnon-motives-based\ntheories\u201d, which are also not risk-assessment theories (Hawley\n2014). They strive to distinguish between trust and mere reliance,\nthough not by associating a particular kind of motive with\ntrustworthiness. Since most philosophical debate about the nature of\ntrust and trustworthiness centers on theories that are either\nmotives-based or non-motives-based, let me expand on each of these\ncategories.\n",
