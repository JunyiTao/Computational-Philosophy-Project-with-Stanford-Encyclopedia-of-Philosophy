    "main_text": "Semantics of \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus || Model Constructions\n7.2 Model Constructions\n\nThe term model we\u2019ve seen in section\n 7.1\n is rather trivial: it directly reflects the syntactic structure of\nthe \\(\\lambda\\)-terms by modeling precisely syntactic equality modulo\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}\\)-provable equality. This makes the term model\nmathematically and philosophically rather uninteresting. The\nconstruction and study of more interesting concrete \\(\\lambda\\)-models\nis one of the principal aims of the model theory for the\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus.\n\nWe\u2019ve already mentioned what\u2019s perhaps the most important,\nbut was definitely the first non-trivial model for the\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus: Scott\u2019s \\(D_\\infty\\). But there are also\nother interesting model constructions, such as Plotkin and\nScott\u2019s graph model \\(P_\\omega\\), first described in (Plotkin\n1972) and (Scott, 1974). These model constructions, however, usually\nrely on fairly involved mathematical methods, both for their\ndefinitions and for verifying that they are indeed \\(\\lambda\\)-models.\nConsequently, covering these constructions goes beyond the scope of\nthis entry; see (Hinley and Seldin, 2008, chapter 16F) for an overview\nof various model constructions and (Barendregt, 1985, chapter 18) for\nmany of the formal details.\n\nOne of the advantages of having different models is that one sees\ndifferent aspects of equality in the \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus: each of the\ndifferent models takes a different view on what \\(\\lambda\\)-terms get\nidentified. An interesting question in this context is: What is\nthe \\(\\lambda\\)-theory of a given class of models? In this\ncontext, we call a class \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) of \\(\\lambda\\)-models\ncomplete just in case every (consistent) \\(\\lambda\\)-theory\nis satisfied by some model in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). See (Salibra, 2003) for\nan overview of various completeness and incompleteness\nresults for interesting classes of \\(\\lambda\\)-models.\n",
