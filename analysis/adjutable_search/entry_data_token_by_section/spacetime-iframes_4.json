Its starting point was a critical\nquestion about the law of inertia: relative to what is the motion of a\nfree particle uniform and rectilinear? If the answer is\n\u201cabsolute space,\u201d then the law would appear to be\nsomething other than an empirical claim, for no one can observe the\ntrajectory of a particle relative to absolute space. Two quite\ndifferent answers to the question were offered in 1870, in the form of\nrevised statements of the law of inertia. Carl Neumann proposed that\nwhen we state the law, we must suppose that there is a body somewhere\nin the universe\u2014the \u201cbody Alpha\u201d\u2014with respect\nto which the motion of a free particle is rectilinear, and that there\nis a time-scale somewhere relative to which it is uniform (Neumann\n1870). Ernst Mach (1883) claimed that the law of inertia, and\nNewton\u2019s laws generally, implicitly appeal to the fixed stars as\na spatial reference-frame, and to the rotation of the earth as a\ntime-scale. At any rate, he maintained, such is the basis for any\ngenuine empirical content that the laws can claim. The notion of\nabsolute space, it followed, was only an unwarranted abstraction from\nthe practice of measuring motions relative to the fixed stars.\n\nMach\u2019s proposal had the advantage of a clear empirical\nmotivation; Neumann\u2019s \u201cbody Alpha\u201d seemed no less\nmysterious than absolute space, and almost sounds comical to the\nmodern reader. But Neumann\u2019s discussion of a time-scale was\nsomewhat more fruitful, and employed the principle that Euler had\nalready expressed (1748): the law of inertia defines a time-scale, by\nwhich equal intervals of time are those in which a free particle\ntravels equal distances. He also noted, however, that this definition\nis quite arbitrary. For, in the absence of a prior definition of equal\ntimes, any motion whatever can be stipulated to be uniform. It is no\nhelp to appeal to the requirement of freedom from external forces,\nsince the free particles presumably are known to us only by their\nuniform motion. We have a genuine empirical claim only when we state\nof at least two free particles that their motions are\nmutually proportional. Equal intervals of time can then be\ndefined as those in which two free particles travel mutually\nproportional distances.\n",
