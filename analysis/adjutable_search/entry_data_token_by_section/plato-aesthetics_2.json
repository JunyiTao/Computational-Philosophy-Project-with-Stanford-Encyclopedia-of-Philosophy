    "main_text": "Beauty || Beauty and art\n1.2 Beauty and art\n\nThe three features of beauty in the Hippias Major also apply\nin the Symposium, Plato\u2019s other major analysis of beauty. In\nthe Symposium Socrates claims to be quoting his teacher\nDiotima on the subject of love, and in the lesson attributed to her\nshe calls beauty the object of every love\u2019s yearning. She spells out\nthe soul\u2019s progress toward ever-purer beauty, from one body to all,\nthen through all beautiful souls to laws and kinds of knowledge,\nfinally reaching beauty itself (210a\u2013211d).\n\nDiotima describes the poet\u2019s task as the begetting of wisdom and other\nvirtues (209a). Ultimately desiring what is beautiful the poet\nproduces works of verse. And who would not envy Homer or Hesiod\n(209d)? But aside from these passages the Symposium seems\nprepared to treat anything but a poem as an exemplar of\nbeauty. In a similar spirit the Philebus\u2019s examples of pure\nsensory beauty exclude pictures (51b\u2013d).\n\nThe Republic contains tokens of Plato\u2019s reluctance to\nassociate poetry with beauty. The dialogue\u2019s first discussion of\npoetry, whose context is education, censors poems that corrupt the\nyoung (377b\u2013398b). Then almost immediately Socrates speaks of\ncultivating a fondness for beauty among the young guardians. Let them\nsee gracefulness (eusch\u00eamosun\u00ea) in paintings and\nillustrative weaving, a sibling to virtue (401a). Their taste for\nbeauty will help them prefer noble deeds over ugly vulgar ones\n(401b\u2013d, 403c). How can Plato have seen the value of beauty to\neducation and not mentioned the subject in his earlier criticisms? Why\ncouldn\u2019t this part of the Republic concede that false and\npernicious poems affect the young through their beauty?\n\nBut the Republic takes pains to deny that beauty appears in\npoetry. Republic 10 calls the beauty of poetic lines\ndeceptive. Take away the decorative language that makes a poetic\nsentiment sound right and put it into ordinary words, and it becomes\nunremarkable, as young people\u2019s faces beautified by youth later show\nthemselves as the plain looks they are (601b).\n",
