    "main_text": "Why Interrogate Chinese Philosophical Texts? || Introduction\n3.1 Introduction\nThere are almost as many answers to this question as there are\ncomparative philosophers working in the field of Chinese thought.\nHerein we may cover only a few of them as illustrative of more general\ntrends and tendencies. Moreover, the reader must bear in mind that a\ngreat many translations and accounts of Chinese philosophy have been\nand still are made by non-philosophers, adding more answers to the\nquestion of why the texts are deemed worthy of interrogation than can\nbe taken up herein.\nDespite the multiplicity of appropriate responses to the questions,\nhowever, the reasons for asking them basically reduce to two, and they\nhold not only for Chinese writings, but all foreign philosophical\ntexts. We translate and interpret them in order to 1) learn more about\nthe people in the culture whence the text came; and/or 2) to learn\nmore about ourselves and our own culture. That is to say, most texts\nworthy of translation and exegesis are both windows on the culture\nthat produced them and mirrors of our own.\nThere are numerous ways these goals can be achieved individually,\nand together, depending on the nature of the approach to the\ntexts. First we will examine briefly the interrogation of Chinese\ntexts against the background of the problems, patterns of\nargument and standards of rational justification in the Western\nphilosophical tradition; its \u201cgrammar\u201d, so to speak\n(Makeham 2012: xii). The governing idea is that although surely\ndifferent, Chinese thinkers have enough in common with their Western\ncounterparts to make associative and contrastive comparisons between\nthem and/or their ideas a useful method of engagement with the\ntext.\nThen, in the following section (3.3) the\ntexts are interrogated a little differently, with the governing idea\nbeing something like a \u201chermeneutics of suspicion\u201d in\nreverse. With this approach the \u201cgrammar\u201d of the Western\nphilosophical tradition is downplayed to the extent possible, the\nexegetes and translators believing that it distorts the Chinese\nmaterials by overwriting them with distinctly Western concerns; we\nshould not look for theodicean writings in a culture without a concept\nof an all-good creator God. Instead of asking \u201cTo what extent do\nthese texts suggest answers to philosophical questions that vex\nus?\u201d they tend to ask \u201c To what extent do these texts\nsuggest we might ask different philosophical questions?\u201d\nFinally, in \u00a73.4 we will sketch quickly\nthe problematik of Chinese philosophers in China, and how and\nwhy it overlaps only slightly at present with the Western\napproaches.\n",
