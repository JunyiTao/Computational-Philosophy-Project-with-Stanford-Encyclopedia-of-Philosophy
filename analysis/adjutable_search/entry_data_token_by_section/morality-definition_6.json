Moreover, it is consistent with advocating\na code, that one does not plan on following that code oneself. Just as\nasserting something one believes to be false still counts as asserting\nit, hypocritical advocacy of a code still counts as advocacy of that\ncode. When endorsement is understood as advocacy, it can be used in\ndefinitions of morality, in the descriptive sense, as long as it is\nthe morality of a group or society. And advocacy can also be used as\nan interpretation of endorsement when providing a definition of\nmorality in the normative sense. Of course those who accept a\ndefinition of morality in any of these senses\u2014as the code that a\ngroup or society endorses, or as the code that would be universally\nadvocated by all rational agents under certain conditions\u2014do not\nhold that the advocacy would necessarily, or even probably, be\nhypocritical. But they do hold that the important thing about a moral\ncode\u2014what picks it out as a moral code\u2014is that it would be\nput forward by all the relevant agents, not that it would be\nfollowed by all of them. The notion of advocacy has less of a\nplace in a descriptive account of a single person\u2019s morality,\nsince when someone is hypocritical we often deny that they really hold\nthe moral view that they advocate.\n\nMill (1861), in addition to offering a moral theory, takes pains to\nexplain how morality differs from other normative systems. For him,\nnorms that simply promote utility are norms of expediency. In order to\nqualify as morally wrong, an act must be one that ought to be\npunished. Thinking that an act of a certain kind ought to be punished\nis a third-personal matter, so it seems plausible to put Mill\u2019s\nview of what is definitional of morality into the category being\ndiscussed in this section. It is worth noting that hypocrisy is, for\nMill, not only a possibility, but\u2014given the present sorry state\nof moral education\u2014virtually unavoidable. That is because being\nmotivated to advocate punishment for a certain kind of act is quite\ndifferent from being motivated to refrain from that same kind of act.\nAdvocating punishment for a certain kind of act might be one\u2019s\nutility-maximizing choice, while actually performing that kind of act\n(trying, of course, to avoid detection) might also be\nutility-maximizing. And for Mill what determines what a person will\nadvocate, and how a person will act, are the foreseeable consequences\nfor that person.\n\nBernard Gert\u2019s (2005) moral view also operates with a definition\nof morality that understands endorsement as advocacy, in the sense of\nputting forward as a guide for all rational agents. Gert offers the\nfollowing two conditions as those under which all rational persons\nwould put forward a universal guide for governing the behavior of all\nmoral agents. The first condition is that they are seeking agreement\nwith all other rational persons or moral agents. The second condition\nis that they use only those beliefs that are shared by all rational\npersons: for example, that they themselves are fallible and vulnerable\nand that all those to whom morality applies are also fallible and\nvulnerable. The second condition rules out both religious beliefs and\nscientific beliefs since there are no religious beliefs or scientific\nbeliefs that all rational persons share. This condition is plausible\nbecause no universal guide to behavior that applies to all rational\npersons can be based on beliefs that some of these rational persons do\nnot share.\n",
