    "preamble": "\n\nDemocritus, known in antiquity as the \u2018laughing\nphilosopher\u2019 because of his emphasis on the value of\n\u2018cheerfulness,\u2019 was one of the two founders of ancient\natomist theory. He elaborated a system originated by his teacher\nLeucippus into a materialist account of the natural world. The\natomists held that there are smallest indivisible bodies from which\neverything else is composed, and that these move about in an infinite\nvoid. Of the ancient materialist accounts of the natural world which\ndid not rely on some kind of teleology or purpose to account for the\napparent order and regularity found in the world, atomism was the most\ninfluential. Even its chief critic, Aristotle, praised Democritus for\narguing from sound considerations appropriate to natural\nphilosophy.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nAccording to ancient reports, Democritus was born about 460 BCE (thus,\nhe was a younger contemporary of Socrates) and was a citizen of\nAbdera, although some reports mention Miletus. As well as his\nassociate or teacher Leucippus, Democritus is said to have known\nAnaxagoras, and to have been forty years younger than the latter (DK\n68A1). A number of anecdotes concern his life, but their authenticity\nis uncertain.\n\nThe work of Democritus has survived only in secondhand reports,\nsometimes unreliable or conflicting: the reasoning behind the\npositions taken often needs to be reconstructed. Much of the best\nevidence is that reported by Aristotle, who regarded him as an\nimportant rival in natural philosophy. Aristotle wrote a monograph on\nDemocritus, of which only a few passages quoted in other sources have\nsurvived. Democritus seems to have taken over and systematized the\nviews of Leucippus, of whom little is known. Although it is possible\nto distinguish some contributions as those of Leucippus, the\noverwhelming majority of reports refer either to both figures, or to\nDemocritus alone; the developed atomist system is often regarded as\nessentially Democritus\u2019.\n\nDiogenes Laertius lists a large number of works by Democritus on many\nfields, including ethics, physics, mathematics, music and cosmology.\nTwo works, the Great World System and the Little World\nSystem (see the entry on\n doxography of ancient philosophy),\n are sometimes ascribed to Democritus, although Theophrastus reports\nthat the former is by Leucippus (DK 68A33). There is more uncertainty\nconcerning the authenticity of the reports of Democritus\u2019 ethical\nsayings. Two collections of sayings are recorded in the fifth-century\nanthology of Stobaeus, one ascribed to Democritus and another ascribed\nto an otherwise unknown philosopher \u2018Democrates\u2019. DK\naccepts both as relating to Democritus, but the authenticity of\nsayings in both collections is a matter of scholarly discussion, as is\nthe relationship between Democritus\u2019 atomism and his ethics.\n2. Atomist Doctrine\n\nAncient sources describe atomism as one of a number of attempts by\nearly Greek natural philosophers to respond to the challenge offered\nby Parmenides. Despite occasional challenges (Osborne 2004), this is\nhow its motivation is generally interpreted by scholars today.\nAlthough the exact interpretation of Parmenides is disputed, he was\ntaken to have argued that change is merely illusory because of some\nabsurdities inherent in the idea of \u2018what is not\u2019. In\nresponse, Leucippus and Democritus, along with other Presocratic\npluralists such as Empedocles and Anaxagoras, developed systems that\nclarified how change does not require that something should come to be\nfrom nothing.  These responses to Parmenides suppose that there are\nmultiple unchanging material principles, which persist and merely\nrearrange themselves to form the changing world of appearances. In the\natomist version, these unchanging material principles are indivisible\nparticles, the atoms. The idea that there is a lower limit to\ndivisibility is sometimes taken as an answer to Zeno\u2019s paradoxes about\nthe impossibility of traversing infinitely divisible magnitudes\n(Hasper 2006). Reconstructions offered by Wardy (1988) and Sedley\n(2008) argue, instead, that atomism was developed as a response to\nParmenidean arguments.\n\nThe atomists held that there are two fundamentally different kinds of\nrealities composing the natural world, atoms and void. Atoms, from the\nGreek adjective atomos or atomon,\n\u2018indivisible,\u2019 are infinite in number and various in size\nand shape, and perfectly solid, with no internal gaps. They move about\nin an infinite void, repelling one another when they collide or\ncombining into clusters by means of tiny hooks and barbs on their\nsurfaces, which become entangled. Other than changing place, they are\nunchangeable, ungenerated and indestructible. All changes in the\nvisible objects of the world of appearance are brought about by\nrelocations of these atoms: in Aristotelian terms, the atomists reduce\nall change to change of place. Macroscopic objects in the world that\nwe experience are really clusters of these atoms; changes in the\nobjects we see\u2014qualitative changes or growth, say\u2014are\ncaused by rearrangements or additions to the atoms composing them.\nWhile the atoms are eternal, the objects compounded out of them are\nnot. Clusters of atoms moving in the infinite void come to form\nkosmoi or worlds as a result of a circular motion that\ngathers atoms up into a whirl, creating clusters within it (DK\n68B167); these kosmoi are impermanent. Our world and the\nspecies within it have arisen from the collision of atoms moving about\nin such a whirl, and will likewise disintegrate in time.\n\nIn supposing that void exists, the atomists deliberately embraced an\napparent contradiction, claiming that \u2018what is not\u2019\nexists. Apparently addressing an argument by Melissus, a follower of\nParmenides, the atomists paired the term for \u2018nothing\u2019\nwith what it negates, \u2018thing,\u2019 and claimed that\u2014in a\nphrase typical of the atomists\u2014the one \u2018no more\u2019\nexists than the other (DK 67A6). Schofield (2002) argues that this\nparticular phrase originated with Democritus and not his teacher\nLeucippus. By putting the full (or solid) and the void ontologically\non a par, the atomists were apparently denying the impossibility of\nvoid. Void they considered to be a necessary condition for local\nmotion: if there were no unoccupied places, where could bodies move\ninto? Melissus had argued from the impossibility of void to the\nimpossibility of motion; the atomists apparently reasoned in reverse,\narguing from the fact that motion exists to the necessity for void\nspace to exist (DK 67A7). It has been suggested that Democritus\u2019\nconception of void is that of the (temporarily) unfilled regions\nbetween atoms rather than a concept of absolute space (Sedley 1982).\nVoid does not impede the motion of atoms because its essential quality\nis that of \u2018yielding,\u2019 in contrast to the mutual\nresistance of atoms. Later atomist accounts attest that this\n\u2018yielding\u2019 explains the tendency of bodies to drift into\nemptier spaces, driven out by collision from more densely packed\nregions (Lucretius DRN 6.906\u20131089).\n\nSome controversy surrounds the properties of the atoms. They vary in\nsize: one report\u2014which some scholars question\u2014suggests\nthat atoms could, in principle, be as large as a cosmos, although at\nleast in this cosmos they all seem to be too small to perceive (DK\n68A47). They can take on an infinite variety of shapes: there are\nreports of an argument that there is \u2018no more\u2019 reason for\nthe atoms to be one shape than another. Many kinds of atoms can\ninterlock with one another because of their irregular shapes and hooks\nat their surface, accounting for the cohesiveness of some compounds.\nIt is not clear whether the early atomists regarded atoms as\nconceptually indivisible or merely physically indivisible (Furley\n1967). The idea that there is a smallest possible magnitude seems to\nsuggest that this is the lower limit of size for atoms, although\nnotions like being in contact or having shape seem to entail that even\nthe smallest atoms have parts in some sense, if only mathematically or\nconceptually.\n\nThere are conflicting reports on whether atoms move in a particular\ndirection as a result of their weight: a number of scholars have tried\nto reconcile these by supposing that weight is not intrinsic to the\natoms, but is a result of the centripetal tendencies set up in the\ncosmic whirl (cf. O\u2019Brien 1981; Furley 1989, pp. 91\u2013102). Atoms\nmay have an inherent tendency to a kind of vibratory motion, although\nthe evidence for this is uncertain (McDiarmid 1958). However, their\nprimary movement seems to result from collision with other atoms,\nwherein their mutual resistance or antitupia causes them to\nmove away from one another when struck. Democritus is criticized by\nAristotle for supposing that the sequence of colliding atoms has no\nbeginning, and thus for not offering an explanation of the existence\nof atomic motion per se, even though the prior collision with\nanother atom can account for the direction of each individual atomic\nmotion (see O\u2019Keefe 1996). Although the ancient atomists are often\ncompared to modern \u2018mechanistic\u2019 theories, Balme warned of\nthe danger of assuming that the atomists share modern ideas about the\nnature of atomic motion, particularly the idea that motion is inertial\n(Balme 1941).\n\nAccording to different reports, Democritus ascribed the causes of\nthings to necessity, and also to chance. Probably the latter term\nshould be understood as \u2018absence of purpose\u2019 rather than a\ndenial of necessity (Barnes 1982, pp. 423\u20136). Democritus\napparently recognized a need to account for the fact that the\ndisorderly motion of individual distinct atoms could produce an\norderly cosmos in which atoms are not just randomly scattered, but\ncluster to form masses of distinct types. He is reported to have\nrelied on a tendency of \u2018like to like\u2019 which exists in\nnature: just as animals of a kind cluster together, so atoms of\nsimilar kinds cluster by size and shape. He compares this to the\nwinnowing of grains in a sieve, or the sorting of pebbles riffled by\nthe tide: it is as if there were a kind of attraction of like\nto like (DK 68B164). Although this claim has been interpreted\ndifferently (e.g. Taylor 1999b p. 188), it seems to be an attempt to\nshow how an apparently ordered arrangement can arise automatically, as\na byproduct of the random collisions of bodies in motion (Furley 1989,\np. 79). No attractive forces or purposes need be introduced to explain\nthe sorting by the tide or in the sieve: it is probable that this is\nan attempt to show how apparently orderly effects can be produced\nwithout goal-directioned forces or purpose.\n\nDemocritus regards the properties of atoms in combination as\nsufficient to account for the multitude of differences among the\nobjects in the world that appears to us. Aristotle cites an analogy to\nthe letters of the alphabet, which can produce a multitude of\ndifferent words from a few elements in combinations; the differences\nall stem from the shape (sch\u00eama) of the letters, as A\ndiffers from N; by their arrangement (taxis), as AN differs\nfrom NA; and by their positional orientation (thesis), as N\ndiffers from Z (DK 67A6). These terms are Aristotle\u2019s interpretation\nof Democritus\u2019 own terminology, which has a more dynamic sense\n(Mourelatos 2004). This passage omits differences of size, perhaps\nbecause it is focused on the analogy to letters of the alphabet: it is\nquite clear from other texts that Democritus thinks that atoms also\ndiffer in size.\n\nHe famously denies that perceptible qualities other than shape and\nsize (and, perhaps, weight) really exist in the atoms themselves: one\ndirect quotation surviving from Democritus claims that \u2018by\nconvention sweet and by convention bitter, by convention hot, by\nconvention cold, by convention color; but in reality atoms and\nvoid\u2019 (DK 68B9, trans. Taylor 1999a).  There are different\naccounts of this distinction.  Furley argues that the translation\n\u2018convention\u2019 should not be taken to suggest that there is\nanything arbitrary about the perception of certain colors,\nsay: the same configuration of atoms may be regularly associated with\na given color (Furley 1993; cf. Barnes 1982, pp. 370\u20137). What\nDemocritus rejects with the label \u2018merely conventional\u2019\nis, perhaps, the imputation of the qualities in question to the atoms,\nor perhaps even to macroscopic bodies.  Mourelatos (2005) draws\nthe contrast as that between intrinsic and relational properties.\n\nWhile several reports of Democritus\u2019 view, apparently direct\nquotations, mention exclusively sensible qualities as being unreal, a\nreport of Plutarch includes in the list of things that exist only by\nconvention the notion of \u2018combination\u2019 or\nsunkrisis. If this report is genuinely Democritean, it would\nbroaden the scope of the claim considerably: the idea that any\ncombination\u2014by which he presumably means any cluster of\natoms\u2014is \u2018unreal\u2019 or merely\n\u2018conventional\u2019 suggests that Democritus is drawing a more\nradical distinction than that between sensible and nonsensible\nqualities. The implication would be that anything perceived, because\nit is a perception of combinations of atoms and not atoms themselves,\nwould be suspect, not merely the qualia experienced by means\nof individual sense organs. One report indeed attributes to Democritus\na denial that two things could become one, or vice versa (DK 68A42),\nthus suggesting that combinations are regarded as conventional.\n\nCommentators differ as to the authenticity of Plutarch\u2019s report. As\nthe word sunkrisis does not occur in other reports, Furley\n(following Sandbach) suggests that it is most likely an error for\npikron, \u2018bitter\u2019 which occurs instead in another\nreport. However, Furley concedes that Plutarch at least\nunderstands the earliest atomists to be committed to the view that all\ncombinations of atoms, as much as sensible qualities, should be\nunderstood as conventional rather than real (Furley 1993 pp.\n76\u20137n7). This would suggest that everything at the macroscopic\nlevel\u2014or, strictly, everything available to perception\u2014is\nregarded as unreal. The ontological status of arrangement or\ncombination of atoms for Democritus is a vexed question, that affects\nour understanding of his metaphysics, his historical relationship to\nMelissus, and the similarity of his views to the modern\nprimary-secondary quality distinction (Wardy 1988; Curd 1998; Lee\n2005; Mourelatos 2005; Pasnau 2007). If we take the\n\u2018conventionality\u2019 thesis to be restricted to sensible\nqualities, there is still an open question about Democritus\u2019 reason\nfor denying their \u2018reality\u2019 (Wardy 1988; O\u2019Keefe 1997;\nGanson 1999).\n3. Theory of Perception\n\nDemocritus\u2019 theory of perception depends on the claim that\neid\u00f4la or images, thin layers of atoms, are constantly\nsloughed off from the surfaces of macroscopic bodies and carried\nthrough the air. Later atomists cite as evidence for this the gradual\nerosion of bodies over time. These films of atoms shrink and expand;\nonly those that shrink sufficiently can enter the eye. It is the\nimpact of these on our sense organs that enables us to perceive.\nVisible properties of macroscopic objects, like their size and shape,\nare conveyed to us by these films, which tend to be distorted as they\npass through greater distances in the air, since they are subject to\nmore collisions with air atoms. A different or complementary account\nclaims that the object seen impresses the air by the\neid\u00f4la, and the compacted air thus conveys the image to\nthe eye (DK 68A135; Baldes 1975). The properties perceived by other\nsenses are also conveyed by contact of some kind. Democritus\u2019 theory\nof taste, for example, shows how different taste sensations are\nregularly produced by contact with different shapes of atoms.\n\nTheophrastus, who gives us the most thorough report of Democritus\u2019\ntheory, criticizes it for raising the expectation that the same kinds\nof atoms would always cause similar appearances. However, it may be\nthat most explanations are directed towards the normal case\nof a typical observer, and that a different account is given as to the\nperceptions of a nontypical observer, such as someone who is\nill. Democritus\u2019 account why honey sometimes tastes bitter to people\nwho are ill depends on two factors, neither of which undercut the\nnotion that certain atomic shapes regularly affect us in a given way.\nOne is that a given substance like honey is not quite homogeneous, but\ncontains atoms of different shapes. While it takes its normal\ncharacter from the predominant type of atom present, there are other\natom-types present within. The other is that our sense-organs need to\nbe suitably harmonized to admit a given atom-type, and the disposition\nof our passageways can be affected by illness or other conditions.\nThus someone who is ill may become unusually receptive to an atom-type\nthat is only a small part of honey\u2019s overall constitution.\n\nOther observed effects, however, require a theory whereby the same\natoms can produce different effects without supposing that the\nobserver has changed. The change must then occur in the object seen.\nThe explanation of color seems to be of this variety: Aristotle\nreports that things acquire their color by \u2018turning,\u2019\ntrop\u00ea (GC 1.2, 315b34). This is the\nDemocritean term that Aristotle had translated as\n\u2018position,\u2019 thesis, i.e. one of the three\nfundamental ways in which atoms can alter and thus appear differently\nto us. Aristotle gives this as the reason why color is not ascribed to\nthe atoms themselves. Lucretius\u2019 account of why color cannot belong to\natoms may help clarify the point here. We are told that if the sea\u2019s\natoms were really blue, they could not undergo some change and look\nwhite (DRN 2.774\u20135), as when we observe the sea\u2019s\nsurface changing from blue to white. This seems to assume that, while\nan appearance of a property P can be produced by something that is\nneither P nor not-P, nonetheless something P cannot appear not-P.\nSince atoms do not change their intrinsic properties, it seems that\nchange in a relational property, such as the relative position of\natoms, is most likely to be the cause of differing perceptions. In the\nshifting surface of the sea or the flutter of the pigeon with its\nirridescent neck, it is evident that the parts of the object are\nmoving and shifting in their positional relations.\n\nBy ascribing the causes of sensible qualities to relational properties\nof atoms, Democritus forfeits the prima facie plausibility of\nclaiming that things seem P because they are P. Much\nof Theophrastus\u2019 report seems to focus on the need to make it\nplausible that a composite can produce an appearance of properties it\ndoes not intrinsically possess. Democritus is flying in the face of at\nleast one strand of commonsense when he claims that textures produce\nthe appearance of hot or cold, impacts cause colour sensations. The\nlists of examples offered, drawing on commonsense associations or\nanecdotal experience, are attempts to make such claims persuasive.\nHeat is said to be caused by spherical atoms, because these move\nfreely: the commonsense association of quick movement with heating may\nbe employed here. Betegh (2020) suggests that larger void spaces are\ndirectly associated with heating, rather than that rarefaction\nindirectly causes heat by allowing freer and more frequent atomic\nmotion.\n\nAristotle sometimes criticizes Democritus for claiming that visible,\naudible, olfactory and gustatory sensations are all caused by touch\n(DK 68A119). Quite how this affects the account of perception is not\nclear, as the sources tells us little about how touch is thought to\nwork. Democritus does not, however, seem to distinguish between touch\nand contact, and may take it to be unproblematic that bodies\ncommunicate their size, shape and surface texture by physical\nimpact.\n4. The Soul and the Nature of Living Things\n\nIn common with other early ancient theories of living things,\nDemocritus seems to have used the term psych\u00ea to refer\nto that distinctive feature of living things that accounts for their\nability to perform their life-functions. According to Aristotle,\nDemocritus regarded the soul as composed of one kind of atom, in\nparticular fire atoms. This seems to have been because of the\nassociation of life with heat, and because spherical fire atoms are\nreadily mobile, and the soul is regarded as causing motion. Democritus\nseems to have considered thought to be caused by physical movements of\natoms also. This is sometimes taken as evidence that Democritus denied\nthe survival of a personal soul after death, although the reports are\nnot univocal on this.\n\nOne difficulty faced by materialist theories of living things is to\naccount for the existence and regular reproduction of functionally\nadapted forms in the natural world. Although the atomists have\nconsiderable success in making it plausible that a simple ontology of\natoms and void, with the minimal properties of the former, can account\nfor a wide variety of differences in the objects in the perceptible\nworld, and also that a number of apparently orderly effects can be\nproduced as a byproduct of disorderly atomic collisions, the kind of\nfunctional organization found in organisms is much harder to\nexplain.\n\nDemocritus seems to have developed a view of reproduction according to\nwhich all parts of the body contribute to the seed from which the new\nanimal grows, and that both parents contribute seed (DK 68A141; 143).\nThe theory seems to presuppose that the presence of some material from\neach organ in the seed accounts for the development of that organ in\nthe new organism. Parental characteristics are inherited when the\ncontribution of one or other parent predominates in supplying the\nappropriate part. The offspring is male or female according to which\nof the two seeds predominates in contributing material from the\ngenitals. In an atomist cosmos, the existence of particular species is\nnot considered to be eternal. Like some other early materialist\naccounts, Democritus held that human beings arose from the earth (DK\n68A139), although the reports give little detail.\n5. Theory of Knowledge\n\nOne report credits Democritus and Leucippus with the view that thought\nas well as sensation are caused by images impinging on the body from\noutside, and that thought as much as perception depends on images (DK\n67A30). Thought as well as perception are described as changes in the\nbody. Democritus apparently recognized that his view gives rise to an\nepistemological problem: it takes our knowledge of the world to be\nderived from our sense experience, but the senses themselves not to be\nin direct contact with the nature of things, thus leaving room for\nomission or error. A famous fragment may be responding to such a\nskeptical line of thought by accusing the mind of overthrowing the\nsenses, though those are its only access to the truth (DK68B125).\nOther passages talk of a gap between what we can perceive and what\nreally exists (DK 68B6\u201310; 117). But the fact that atoms are not\nperceptible means that our knowledge of their properties is always\nbased on analogy from the things of the visible world. Moreover, the\nsenses report properties that the atoms don\u2019t really possess, like\ncolors and tastes. Thus the potential for doubt about our knowledge of\nthe external world looms large.\n\nLater philosophers adapted a Democritean phrase ou mallon or\n\u2018no more\u2019 in the argument that something that seems both P\nand not-P is \u2018no more\u2019 P than not-P. Arguments of this\nform were used for sceptical purposes, citing the conflicting evidence\nof the senses in order to raise concern about our knowledge of the\nworld (de Lacy 1958). Democritus does not seem to be pursuing a\nconsistently skeptical program, although he does express concern about\nthe basis for our knowledge.\n\nThe idea that our knowledge is based on the reception of images from\noutside us is employed in Democritus\u2019 discussion of the gods, wherein\nit is clear that our knowledge of the gods comes from\neid\u00f4la or giant films of atoms with the characteristics\nwe attribute to the gods, although Democritus denies that they are\nimmortal. Some scholars take this to be a deflationary attack on\ntraditional theology as based on mere images (Barnes 1982, pp.\n456\u201361), but others suppose that the theory posits that these\neid\u00f4la are really living beings (Taylor 1999a, pp.\n211\u20136). Although atomism is often identified as an atheist\ndoctrine in later times, it is not clear whether this is really\nDemocritus\u2019 view.\n6. Indivisibility and Mathematics\n\nThe reasons for supposing that there are indivisible magnitudes\napparently stem from Zeno of Elea\u2019s account of paradoxes that arise if\nextension is understood to be infinitely divisible, i.e. composed of\nan infinite number of parts. The atomists may have sought to avoid\nthese paradoxes by supposing that there is a limit to\ndivisibility.\n\nIt is not clear, however, in what sense the atoms are said to be\nindivisible, and how the need for smallest magnitudes is related to\nthe claim that atoms are indivisible. Furley suggests that the\natomists may not have distinguished between physical and theoretical\nindivisibility of the atoms (Furley 1967, p. 94). The physical\nindivisibility of the atoms seems to be independent of the argument\nfor indivisible magnitudes, since the solidity of atoms\u2014the fact\nthat there is no void within them\u2014is said to be the reason why\nthey cannot be split. The existence of void space between\natoms is cited as the reason why they can be separated: one late\nsource, Philoponus, even suggests that atoms could never actually\ntouch, lest they fuse (DK 67A7). Whether or not Democritus himself saw\nthis consequence, it seems that atoms are taken to be indivisible\nwhatever their size. Presumably, though, there is a smallest size of\natom, and this is thought to be enough to avoid the paradoxes of\ninfinite divisibility.\n\nA reductio ad absurdum argument reported by Aristotle\nsuggests that the atomists argued from the assumption that, if a\nmagnitude is infinitely divisible, nothing prevents it actually having\nbeen divided at every point. The atomist then asks what would remain:\nif the answer is some extended particles, such as dust, then the\nhypothesized division has not yet been completed. If the answer is\nnothing or points, then the question is how an extended magnitude\ncould be composed from what does not have extension (DK 68A48b,\n123). \n\nDemocritus is also said to have contributed to mathematics, and to\nhave posed a problem about the nature of the cone. He argues that if a\ncone is sliced anywhere parallel to its base, the two faces thus\nproduced must either be the same in size or different. If they are the\nsame, however, the cone would seem to be a cylinder; but if they are\ndifferent, the cone would turn out to have step-like rather than\ncontinuous sides. Although it is not clear from Plutarch\u2019s report how\n(or if) Democritus solved the problem, it does seem that he was\nconscious of questions about the relationship between atomism as a\nphysical theory and the nature of mathematical objects.\n7. Ethics\n\nThe reports concerning Democritus\u2019 ethical views pose a number of\ninterpretative problems, including the difficulty of deciding which\nfragments are genuinely Democritean (see above, section 1). In\ncontrast to the evidence for his physical theories, many of the\nethical fragments are lists of sayings quoted without context, rather\nthan critical philosophical discussions of atomist views. Many seem\nlike commonsense platitudes that would be consistent with quite\ndifferent philosophical positions. Thus, despite the large number of\nethical sayings, it is difficult to construct a coherent account of\nhis ethical views. Annas notes the Socratic character of a number of\nthe sayings, and thinks there is a consistent theme about the role of\none\u2019s own intellect in happiness (Annas 2002). The sayings contain\nelements that can be seen as anticipating the more developed ethical\nviews of Epicurus (Warren 2002).\n\nIt is also a matter of controversy whether any conceptual link can be\nfound between atomist physics and the ethical commitments attributed\nto Democritus. Vlastos argued that a number of features of Democritus\u2019\nnaturalistic ethics can be traced to his materialist account of the\nsoul and his rejection of a supernatural grounding for ethics (Vlastos\n1975). Taylor is more sceptical about the closeness of the connection\nbetween Democritus\u2019 ethical views and his atomist physics (Taylor\n1999a, pp. 232\u20134).\n\nThe reports indicate that Democritus was committed to a kind of\nenlightened hedonism, in which the good was held to be an internal\nstate of mind rather than something external to it (see Hasper 2014).\nThe good is given many names, amongst them euthymia or\ncheerfulness, as well as privative terms, e.g. for the absence of\nfear. Some fragments suggest that moderation and mindfulness in one\u2019s\npursuit of pleasures is beneficial; others focus on the need to free\noneself from dependence on fortune by moderating desire. Several\npassages focus on the human ability to act on nature by means of\nteaching and art, and on a notion of balance and moderation that\nsuggests that ethics is conceived as an art of caring for the soul\nanalogous to medicine\u2019s care for the body (Vlastos 1975, pp.\n386\u201394). Others discuss political community, suggesting that\nthere is a natural tendency to form communities.\n8. Anthropology\n\nAlthough the evidence is not certain, Democritus may be the originator\nof an ancient theory about the historical development of human\ncommunities. In contrast to the Hesiodic view that the human past\nincluded a golden age from which the present day is a decline, an\nalternative tradition that may derive from Democritus suggests that\nhuman life was originally like that of animals; it describes the\ngradual development of human communities for purposes of mutual aid,\nthe origin of language, crafts and agriculture. Although the text in\nquestion does not mention Democritus by name, he is the most plausible\nsource (Cole 1967; Cartledge 1997).\n\nIf Democritus is the source for this theory, it suggests that he took\nseriously the need to account for the origin of all aspects of the\nworld of our experience. Human institutions could not be assumed to be\npermanent features or divine gifts. The explanations offered suggest\nthat human culture developed as a response to necessity and the\nhardships of our environment. It has been suggested that the sheer\ninfinite size of the atomist universe and thus the number of possible\ncombinations and arrangements that would occur by chance alone are\nimportant in the development of an account that can show how human\ninstitutions arise without assuming teleological or theological\norigins (Cole 1967). Although here, as on other questions, the\nevidence is less than certain, it is plausible that Democritus\ndeveloped a powerful and consistent explanation of much of the natural\nworld from a very few fundamentals.\n\nFor the reception and subsequent history of Democritean atomism, see\nthe related entry on ancient atomism.\n",
