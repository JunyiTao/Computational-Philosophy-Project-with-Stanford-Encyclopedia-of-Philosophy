    "main_text": "Pragmatic demarcations\n8. Problem or pseudoproblem?\n\n\nNow that we have gotten a sense for the tremendous variety of\napproaches to the problem of logical constants, let us step back and\nreflect on the problem itself and its motivation. We can distinguish\nfour general attitudes toward the problem of logical constants: those\nof the Demarcater, the Debunker, the Relativist, and the Deflater.\n\nDemarcaters hold that the demarcation of logical constants\nis a genuine and important problem, whose solution can be expected to\nilluminate the nature and special status of logic. On their view, the\ntask of logic is to study features that arguments possess in virtue of\ntheir logical forms or\n structures.[25]\n Although there may be some sense in\nwhich the argument\n\n\\[\\label{chicago-north}\n\\frac{\\text{Chicago is north of New Orleans}}\n{\\text{New Orleans is south of Chicago}}\n\\]\n\n\nis a good or \u201cvalid\u201d argument, it is not formally valid.  On\nthe Demarcater\u2019s view, logicians who investigate the (non-formal) kind\nof \u201cvalidity\u201d possessed by \\(\\refp{chicago-north}\\) are straying from\nthe proper province\nof logic into some neighboring domain (here, geography or lexicography;\nin other cases, mathematics or metaphysics). For the Demarcater, then,\nunderstanding the distinction between logical and nonlogical constants\nis essential for understanding what logic is about. (For a forceful\nstatement of the Demarcater\u2019s point of view, see Kneale 1956.)\n\nDebunkers, on the other hand, hold that the so-called\n\u201cproblem of logical constants\u201d is a pseudoproblem (Bolzano 1929,\n\u00a7186; Lakoff 1970, 252\u20134; Coffa 1975; Etchemendy 1983, 1990,\nch.\u00a09; Barwise and Feferman 1985, 6; Read 1994). They do not\ndispute that logicians have traditionally concerned themselves with\nargument forms in which a limited number of expressions occur\nessentially. What they deny is that these expressions and argument\nforms define the subject matter of logic. On their view, logic\nis concerned with validity simpliciter, not just validity that\nholds in virtue of a limited set of \u201clogical forms.\u201d The logician\u2019s\nmethod for studying validity is to classify arguments by their\nforms, but these forms (and the logical constants that in part define\nthem) are logic\u2019s tools, not its subject matter. The forms and\nconstants with which logicians are concerned at a particular point in\nthe development of logic are just a reflection of the logicians\u2019\nprogress (up to that point) in systematically classifying valid\ninferences. Asking what is special about these forms and constants is\nthus a bit like asking what is special about the mountains that can be\nclimbed in a day: \u201cThe information so derived will be too closely\ndependent upon the skill of the climber to tell us much about\ngeography\u201d (Coffa 1975, 114). What makes people logicians is not their\nconcern with \u201cand\u201d, \u201cor\u201d, and \u201cnot\u201d, but their concern with validity,\nconsequence, consistency, and proof, and the distinctive methods they\nbring to their investigations.\n\n\nA good way to see the practical difference between Debunkers and\nDemarcaters is by contrasting their views on the use of counterexamples\nto show invalidity. Demarcaters typically hold that one can show an\nargument to be invalid by exhibiting another argument with the same\nlogical form that has true premises and a false conclusion. Of course,\nan argument will always instantiate multiple forms. For example, the\nargument\n\n\\[\\label{firefighter}\n\\frac{\\text{Firefighter(Joe)}}\n{\\exists x\\,\\text{Firefighter}(x)}\n\\]\n\ncan be seen as an instance of the propositional logical form\n\n\\[\\label{propform}\n\\frac{P}{Q}\n\\]\n\nas well as the more articulated form\n\n\\[\\label{quantform}\n\\frac{F(a)}\n{\\exists x F(x)}.\n\\]\n\n\nAs Massey (1975) reminds us, the fact that there are other arguments\nwith the form \\(\\refp{propform}\\) that have true premises and a false conclusion does\nnot show that \\(\\refp{firefighter}\\) is invalid (or even that it is\n\u201cformally\u201d invalid).\nThe Demarcater will insist that a genuine counterexample to the formal\nvalidity of \\(\\refp{firefighter}\\) would have to exhibit the full\nlogical structure of \\(\\refp{firefighter}\\), which is not \\(\\refp{propform}\\) but\n\\(\\refp{quantform}\\).  Thus the Demarcater\u2019s\nuse of counterexamples to demonstrate the formal invalidity of\narguments presupposes a principled way of discerning the full\nlogical structure of an argument, and hence of distinguishing logical\nconstants from nonlogical\n constants.[26]\n\n\nThe Debunker, by contrast, rejects the idea that one of the many\nargument forms \\(\\refp{firefighter}\\) instantiates should be privileged as\nthe logical form of \\(\\refp{firefighter}\\). On the Debunker\u2019s\nview, counterexamples never\nshow anything about a particular argument. All they show is that a\nform is invalid (that is, that it has invalid instances). To\nshow that a particular argument is invalid, one sort of Debunker\nholds, one needs to describe a possible situation in which the premises\nwould be true and the conclusion false, and to give a formal\ncounterexample is not to do that.\n\n\nThe Demarcater will object that the Debunker\u2019s tolerant attitude\nleaves us with no coherent distinction between logic and other\ndisciplines. For surely it is the chemist, not the logician, who will\nbe called upon to tell us whether the following argument is a good\none:\n\n\\[\\label{litmus}\n\\frac{\\text{HCl turns litmus paper red}}\n{\\text{HCl is an acid}}.\n\\]\n\n\nWithout a principled distinction between logical and nonlogical\nconstants, it seems, logic would need to be a kind of universal\nscience: not just a canon for inference, but an encyclopedia. If logic\nis to be a distinctive discipline, the Demarcater will argue, it must\nconcern itself not with all kinds of validity or goodness of arguments,\nbut with a special, privileged kind: formal validity.\n\n\nAgainst this, the Debunker might insist that deductive validity is a\nfeature arguments have by virtue of the meanings of the terms contained\nin them, so that anyone who understands the premises and conclusion of\nan argument must be in a position to determine, without recourse to\nempirical investigation, whether it is valid. On this conception, logic\nis the study of analytic truth, consequence, consistency, and\nvalidity. Because the relation between premise and conclusion in\n\\(\\refp{litmus}\\)\ndepends on empirical facts, not the meanings of terms, \\(\\refp{litmus}\\) is not\ndeductively\n valid.[27]\n\n\nThis response will not be available to those who have reservations\nabout the\n analytic/synthetic distinction.\n An important example is Tarski (1936a; 1936b; 1983;\n1987; 2002), who was much concerned to define logical truth and\nconsequence in purely mathematical terms, without appealing to suspect\nmodal or epistemic notions. On Tarski\u2019s account, an argument is valid\njust in case there is no interpretation of its nonlogical constants on\nwhich the premises are true and the conclusion false. On this account,\nan argument containing no nonlogical constants is valid just in case it\nis materially truth-preserving (it is not the case that its premises\nare true and its conclusion false). Thus, as Tarski notes, if\nevery expression of a language counted as a logical constant,\nlogical validity would reduce to material truth preservation (or, on\nlater versions of Tarski\u2019s definition, to material truth preservation\non every nonempty domain) (1983, 419). Someone who found this result\nintolerable might take it to show either that there must be a\nprincipled distinction between logical and nonlogical constants (the\nDemarcater\u2019s conclusion), or that Tarski\u2019s definition is misguided (the\nDebunker\u2019s conclusion; see Etchemendy 1990, ch. 9).\n\n\nTarski\u2019s own reaction was more cautious. After concluding that the\ndistinction is \u201ccertainly not quite arbitrary\u201d (1983, 418), he\nwrites:\nPerhaps it will be possible to find important objective\narguments which will enable us to justify the traditional boundary\nbetween logical and extra-logical expressions. But I also consider it\nto be quite possible that investigations will bring no positive\nresults in this direction, so that we shall be compelled to regard\nsuch concepts as \u2018logical consequence\u2019, \u2018analytical\nstatement\u2019, and \u2018tautology\u2019 as relative concepts\nwhich must, on each occasion, be related to a definite, although in\ngreater or less degree arbitrary, division of terms into logical and\nextra-logical. (420; see also Tarski 1987)\n\n\nHere Tarski is describing a position distinct from both the\nDemarcater\u2019s position and the Debunker\u2019s. The Relativist\nagrees with the Demarcater that logical consequence must be understood\nas formal consequence, and so presupposes a distinction\nbetween logical and nonlogical constants. But she agrees with the\nDebunker that we should not ask, \u201cWhich expressions are logical\nconstants and which are not?\u201d The way she reconciles these apparently\nconflicting positions is by relativizing logical consequence\nto a choice of logical constants. For each set C of logical\nconstants, there will be a corresponding notion of\nC-consequence. None of these notions is to be identified with\nconsequence simpliciter; different ones are useful for\ndifferent purposes. In the limiting case, where every expression of the\nlanguage is taken to be a logical constant, we get material\nconsequence, but this is no more (and no less) the consequence\nrelation than any of the others.\n\n\nLike the Relativist, the Deflater seeks a moderate middle\nground between the Demarcater and the Debunker. The Deflater agrees\nwith the Demarcater that there is a real distinction between logical\nand nonlogical constants, and between formally and materially valid\narguments. She rejects the Relativist\u2019s position that logical\nconsequence is a relative notion. But she also rejects the Demarcater\u2019s\nproject of finding precise and illuminating necessary and sufficient\nconditions for logical constancy. \u201cLogical constant\u201d, she holds, is a\n\u201cfamily resemblance\u201d term, so we should not expect to uncover a hidden\nessence that all logical constants share. As Wittgenstein said about\nthe concept of number: \u201cthe strength of the thread does not reside in\nthe fact that some one fibre runs through its whole length, but in the\noverlapping of many fibres\u201d (Wittgenstein 1958, \u00a767). That does\nnot mean that there is no distinction between logical and nonlogical\nconstants, any more than our inability to give a precise definition of\n\u201cgame\u201d means that there is no difference between games and other\nactivities. Nor does it mean that the distinction does not matter. What\nit means is that we should not expect a principled criterion for\nlogical constancy that explains why logic has a privileged\nepistemological or semantic status. (For a nice articulation of this\nkind of view, see G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2002.)\n\n\nThe debate between these four positions cannot be resolved here,\nbecause to some extent \u201cthe proof is in the pudding.\u201d A compelling and\nilluminating account of logical constants\u2014one that vindicated a\ndisciplinary segregation of \\(\\refp{chicago-north}\\) from\n\\(\\refp{firefighter}\\) by showing how these arguments are importantly\ndifferent\u2014might give us reason to be Demarcaters. But it is\nimportant not to get so caught up in the debates between different\nDemarcaters, or between Demarcaters and Debunkers, that one loses sight\nof the other positions one might take toward the problem of logical\n constants.\nFurther reading\n\n\nOther recent general discussions of the problem of logical constants\ninclude Peacocke 1976, McCarthy 1998, Warmbrod 1999, Sainsbury 2001,\nch. 6, and G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2002. Tarski 1936b is essential\nbackground to all of these.\n\n\nFor a discussion of grammatical criteria for logical terms, see\nQuine 1980 and F\u00f8llesdal\u2019s (1980) reply.\n\n\nFor a discussion of the Davidsonian approach, see\nDavidson 1984, Evans 1976, Lycan 1989, Lepore and Ludwig 2002,\nand Edwards 2002.\n\n\nTarski 1986 is a brief and cogent exposition of the\npermutation-invariance approach. For elaboration and\ncriticism, see McCarthy 1981, van Bentham 1989,\nSher 1991, McGee 1996, Feferman 1999 and 2010, Bonnay 2008,\nand Dutilh Novaes 2014. Bonnay 2014 surveys recent work\nin this area.\n\n\n\nHacking 1979 and Peacocke 1987 are good representatives of the two\nversions of the inferential characterization approach discussed above.\nPopper\u2019s papers (1946\u20137, 1947) are still worth reading; see\nSchroeder-Heister 1984 for critical discussion and Koslow 1999 for a\nmodern approach reminiscent of Popper\u2019s.

A different kind of pragmatic approach can\nbe found in Brandom (2000, ch. 1; 2008, ch. 2), who characterizes\nlogical vocabulary in terms of its expressive role.\n\n\nFor critiques of the whole project of demarcating the logical\nconstants, see Coffa 1975, Etchemendy (1983; 1990, ch. 9), and Read\n1994.\n",
