Dummett\nhimself stressed parallels between anti-realism and intuitionism in\nthe philosophy of mathematics.\n\nAnother view on truth which returns to pragmatist themes is the\n\u2018internal realism\u2019 of Putnam (1981). There Putnam glosses\ntruth as what would be justified under ideal epistemic conditions.\nWith the pragmatists, Putnam sees the ideal conditions as something\nwhich can be approximated, echoing the idea of truth as the end of\ninquiry.\n\nPutnam is cautious about calling his view anti-realism, preferring the\nlabel \u2018internal realism\u2019. But he is clear that he sees his\nview as opposed to realism (\u2018metaphysical realism\u2019, as he\ncalls it).\n\nDavidson\u2019s views on truth have also been associated with\npragmatism, notably by Rorty (1986). Davidson has distanced himself\nfrom this interpretation (e.g., 1990), but he does highlight\nconnections between truth and belief and meaning. Insofar as these are\nhuman attitudes or relate to human actions, Davidson grants there is\nsome affinity between his views and those of some pragmatists\n(especially, he says, Dewey).\n",
