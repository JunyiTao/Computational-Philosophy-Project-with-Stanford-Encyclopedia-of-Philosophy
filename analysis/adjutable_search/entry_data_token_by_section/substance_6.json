    "main_text": "History of the Philosophical Debate on Substance || Hume and Kant on substance\n2.6 Hume and Kant on substance\n\nIt is plausible to maintain the general thesis that there are many\nissues on which Hume was a sceptic or nihilist, but where his legacy\nis more reductionist than sceptical or nihilist. This general thesis\ncan be explained and illustrated by considering his treatment of\nsubstance, for it is a case in question.\n\nAccording to Hume, in the Treatise, our belief in substance\nis the result of a mistake or illusion.\n\nWhen we gradually follow an object in its successive changes, the\nsmooth progress of the thought makes us ascribe an identity to the\nsuccession\u2026When we compare its situation after a considerable\nchange the progress of the thought is broken; and consequently we are\npresented with the idea of diversity: In order to reconcile which\ncontradictions, the imagination is apt to feign something unknown and\ninvisible, which it supposes to continue the same under all these\nvariations; and this unintelligible something it calls a\nsubstance, or original and first matter. (1978: 220)\n\n\nHume\u2019s target is any account that postulates a unifying\n\u2018something\u2019 that underlies change, whether this be a\ncharacterless substratum, a substantial form or (though this is not\nexplicitly mentioned) something like the \u2018continuing life\u2019\nthat Locke sees as passed on in living things. The crucial point is\nthat a succession of very similar things does not constitute the real\ncontinuation of anything, only the illusion of real continuation.\n\nThus Hume\u2019s treatment of substance is like his treatment of\ncausation, in that he sees both as the projection onto the world of a\ntendency of our minds either to pass from one thing to another or to\nassociate them in some way. He either doubts that there are such\nthings as substance or causation (scepticism) or even positively\ndenies that there are (nihilism). Out of Hume\u2019s very forthright\nnegative attitude there developed two more subtle variants. One of\nthese variants is in the empiricist tradition. That tradition modified\nHume\u2019s approach by developing it into a form of reductionism.\nThe experiences that gave rise, through habit, to the mistaken belief\n(in, for example, substance or causation) are presented as what the\nbelief really affirms. That is, the empirical basis for what Hume\ndeems to be an illusion, is reinterpreted as the reductive account of\nthe concept. Causation then becomes constant conjunction, or substance\na name for a bundle of properties organised in a certain way or the\ncontinuing of the possibility of certain sensations.\n\nKant developed the other variant. He took Hume\u2019s\n\u2018tendencies of the mind to pass\u2019 from one idea to another,\nwithout which we could not construct the world, and canonised them as\na priori categories of the understanding. Hume\u2019s empiricist\nemphasis is psychological. It concerns what we are habituated to do.\nBecause of his empiricism, he will not bring non-psychological\nnecessity into it. Nevertheless, there is the implication that making\nthese transitions is the only way in which one can understand\nthe world. Kant drops the empirical psychology and makes it a matter\nof a priori psychology, that only by employing certain categories\ncould we have experience as of a physical world. It is only by\nunderstanding the world as possessing enduring spatio-temporal\nobjects, which enter into causal relations with each other (that is,\nit is only by applying the categories of substance and causation) that\nwe can have intelligible experience. Substances\u2014that is, a\nframework of stable, enduring objects\u2014are essential, but the\nsource of this necessity lies not in how the world is in itself, but\nin the framework that we are obliged to impose.\n\nIn the Kantian philosophy of P. F. Strawson (1959, 1966), this\nframework of necessity is taken in a more common-sense and realist\nspirit. The world must possess such enduring objects for it to be\nintelligible for us\u2014indeed, for us to be part of it, for we are\nessentially stable bodies amongst other stable bodies. The important\npoint for both Strawson and Kant is that there must be substances for\nthere to be a coherent empirical, spatio-temporal world.\nSubstance has become a formal concept of central\nimportance\u2014that is a concept with a special central role in the\nstructure of our conceptual scheme\u2014rather than being the name\nfor certain kinds of important things in the world. This distinction,\nhowever, is one that has to be handled carefully, especially within a\nrealist Kantian framework, such as Strawson provides. This should\nbecome clear below when we discuss Wiggins\u2019s theory, which is\nboth Aristotelian and Strawsonian. Nevertheless, it gives ground for\nadding the seventh of the marks of substance mentioned in the\nIntroduction, namely that substances are those enduring particulars\nthat give unity to our spatio-temporal framework and individuation and\nre-identification of which enables us to locate ourselves in that\nframework.\n",
