    "main_text": "Criteria for evaluating analogical arguments || Other theories\n3.5 Other theories\n3.5.1 Connectionist models\n\nDuring the past thirty-five years, cognitive scientists have conducted\nextensive research on analogy. Gentner\u2019s SME is just one of many\ncomputational theories, implemented in programs that construct and use\nanalogies. Three helpful anthologies that span this period are Helman\n1988; Gentner, Holyoak, and Kokinov 2001; and Kokinov, Holyoak, and\nGentner 2009.\n\nOne predominant objective of this research has been to model the\ncognitive processes involved in using analogies. Early models tended\nto be oriented towards \u201cunderstanding the basic constraints that\ngovern human analogical thinking\u201d (Hummel and Holyoak 1997:\n458). Recent connectionist models have been directed towards\nuncovering the psychological mechanisms that come into play when we\nuse analogies: retrieval of a relevant source domain,\nanalogical mapping across domains, and transfer of\ninformation and learning of new categories or schemas.\n\nIn some cases, such as the structure-mapping theory (\u00a73.4), this\nresearch overlaps directly with the normative questions that are the\nfocus of this entry; indeed, Gentner\u2019s Systematicity\nPrinciple may be interpreted normatively. In other cases, we\nmight view the projects as displacing those traditional\nnormative questions with up-to-date, computational forms of\n naturalized epistemology.\n Two approaches are singled out here because both raise important\nchallenges to the very idea of finding sharp answers to those\nquestions, and both suggest that connectionist models offer a more\nfruitful approach to understanding analogical reasoning.\n\nThe first is the constraint-satisfaction\nmodel (also known as the multiconstraint\ntheory), developed by Holyoak and Thagard (1989, 1995).\nLike Gentner, Holyoak and Thagard regard the heart of analogical\nreasoning as analogy mapping, and they stress the importance\nof systematicity, which they refer to as a structural\nconstraint. Unlike Gentner, they acknowledge two additional types of\nconstraints. Pragmatic constraints take into account the\ngoals and purposes of the agent, recognizing that \u201cthe purpose\nwill guide selection\u201d of relevant similarities.\nSemantic constraints represent estimates of the degree to\nwhich people regard source and target items as being alike, rather\nlike Hesse\u2019s \u201cpre-theoretic\u201d similarities.\n\nThe novelty of the multiconstraint theory is that these\nstructural, semantic and pragmatic\nconstraints are implemented not as rigid rules, but rather as\n\u2018pressures\u2019 supporting or inhibiting potential pairwise\ncorrespondences. The theory is implemented in a connectionist program\ncalled ACME (Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine),\nwhich assigns an initial activation value to each possible pairing\nbetween elements in the source and target domains (based on semantic\nand pragmatic constraints), and then runs through cycles that update\nthe activation values based on overall coherence (structural\nconstraints). The best global analogy mapping emerges under the\npressure of these constraints. Subsequent connectionist models, such\nas Hummel and Holyoak\u2019s LISA program (1997, 2003), have made\nsignificant advances and hold promise for offering a more complete\ntheory of analogical reasoning.\n\nThe second example is Hofstadter and Mitchell\u2019s\nCopycat program (Hofstadter 1995; Mitchell\n1993). The program is \u201cdesigned to discover insightful\nanalogies, and to do so in a psychologically realistic way\u201d\n(Hofstadter 1995: 205). Copycat operates in the domain of\nletter-strings. The program handles the following type of problem:\n\nSuppose the letter-string abc were changed to abd;\nhow would you change the letter-string ijk in \u201cthe same\nway\u201d?\n\nMost people would answer ijl, since it is natural to think\nthat abc was changed to abd by the\n\u201ctransformation rule\u201d: replace the rightmost letter with\nits successor. Alternative answers are possible, but do not agree with\nmost people\u2019s sense of what counts as the natural analogy.\n\nHofstadter and Mitchell believe that analogy-making is in large part\nabout the perception of novel patterns, and that such\nperception requires concepts with \u201cfluid\u201d boundaries.\nGenuine analogy-making involves \u201cslippage\u201d of concepts.\nThe Copycat program combines a set of core concepts pertaining to\nletter-sequences (successor, leftmost and so forth)\nwith probabilistic \u201chalos\u201d that link distinct concepts\ndynamically. Orderly structures emerge out of random low-level\nprocesses and the program produces plausible solutions. Copycat thus\nshows that analogy-making can be modeled as a process akin to\nperception, even if the program employs mechanisms distinct from those\nin human perception.\n\nThe multiconstraint theory and Copycat share the idea that analogical\ncognition involves cognitive processes that operate below the level of\nabstract reasoning. Both computational models\u2014to the extent that\nthey are capable of performing successful analogical\nreasoning\u2014challenge the idea that a successful model of\nanalogical reasoning must take the form of a set of quasi-logical\ncriteria. Efforts to develop a quasi-logical theory of\nanalogical reasoning, it might be argued, have failed. In place of\nfaulty inference schemes such as those described earlier\n (\u00a72.2,\n \u00a72.4), computational models substitute procedures\nthat can be judged on their performance rather than on traditional\nphilosophical standards.\n\nIn response to this argument, we should recognize the value of the\nconnectionist models while acknowledging that we still need a theory\nthat offers normative principles for evaluating analogical arguments.\nIn the first place, even if the construction and recognition of\nanalogies are largely a matter of perception, this does not eliminate\nthe need for subsequent critical evaluation of analogical inferences.\nSecond and more importantly, we need to look not just at the\nconstruction of analogy mappings but at the ways in which individual\nanalogical arguments are debated in fields such as mathematics,\nphysics, philosophy and the law. These high-level debates require\nreasoning that bears little resemblance to the computational processes\nof ACME or Copycat. (Ashley\u2019s HYPO (Ashley 1990) is one example\nof a non-connectionist program that focuses on this aspect of\nanalogical reasoning.) There is, accordingly, room for both\ncomputational and traditional philosophical models of analogical\nreasoning.\n3.5.2 Articulation model\n\nMost prominent theories of analogy, philosophical and computational,\nare based on overall similarity between source and target\ndomains\u2014defined in terms of some favoured subset of\nHesse\u2019s horizontal relations (see\n \u00a72.2).\n Aristotle and Mill, whose approach is echoed in textbook discussions,\nsuggest counting similarities. Hesse\u2019s theory\n (\u00a73.3)\n favours \u201cpre-theoretic\u201d correspondences. The\nstructure-mapping theory and its successors\n (\u00a73.4)\n look to systematicity, i.e., to correspondences involving complex,\nhigh-level networks of relations. In each of these approaches, the\nproblem is twofold: overall similarity is not a reliable guide to\nplausibility, and it fails to explain the plausibility of any\nanalogical argument.\n\nBartha\u2019s articulation model (2010)\nproposes a different approach, beginning not with horizontal\nrelations, but rather with a classification of analogical arguments on\nthe basis of the vertical relations within each domain. The\nfundamental idea is that a good analogical argument must satisfy two\nconditions:\n\nPrior Association. There must be a clear connection, in the\nsource domain, between the known similarities (the positive analogy)\nand the further similarity that is projected to hold in the target\ndomain (the hypothetical analogy). This relationship determines which\nfeatures of the source are critical to the analogical\ninference.\n\nPotential for Generalization. There must be reason to think\nthat the same kind of connection could obtain in the target domain.\nMore pointedly: there must be no critical disanalogy between\nthe domains.\n\nThe first order of business is to make the prior association explicit.\nThe standards of explicitness vary depending on the nature of this\nassociation (causal relation, mathematical proof, functional\nrelationship, and so forth). The two general principles are fleshed\nout via a set of subordinate models that allow us to identify critical\nfeatures and hence critical disanalogies.\n\nTo see how this works, consider\n Example 7\n (Rectangles and boxes). In this analogical argument, the source\ndomain is two-dimensional geometry: we know that of all rectangles\nwith a fixed perimeter, the square has maximum area. The target domain\nis three-dimensional geometry: by analogy, we conjecture that of all\nboxes with a fixed surface area, the cube has maximum volume. This\nargument should be evaluated not by counting similarities,\nlooking to pre-theoretic resemblances between rectangles and boxes, or\nconstructing connectionist representations of the domains and\ncomputing a systematicity score for possible mappings. Instead, we\nshould begin with a precise articulation of the prior association in\nthe source domain, which amounts to a specific proof for the result\nabout rectangles. We should then identify, relative to that proof, the\ncritical features of the source domain: namely, the concepts and\nassumptions used in the proof. Finally, we should assess the potential\nfor generalization: whether, in the three-dimensional setting, those\ncritical features are known to lack analogues in the target domain.\nThe articulation model is meant to reflect the conversations that can\nand do take place between an advocate and a critic\nof an analogical argument.\n",
