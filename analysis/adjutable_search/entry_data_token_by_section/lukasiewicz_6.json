    "main_text": "Many-Valued Logic || Possibility and the Third Value\n5.1 Possibility and the Third Value\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s most celebrated achievement was his\ndevelopment of many-valued logics. This revolutionary development came\nin the context of discussing modality, in particular possibility. To\nmodern logicians, used to the idea of modal logic being grafted onto\nclassical bivalent logic, this may seem odd. But let us consider how\n\u0141ukasiewicz arrived at the idea. If \\(p\\) be any proposition, let\n\\(Lp\\) notate that it is necessary that \\(p\\) and \\(Mp\\) that it is\npossible that \\(p\\). The two modal operators are connected by the\nusual equivalence \\(ENLpMNp\\). Everyone accepts the implications\n\\(CLpp\\) and \\(CpMp\\). \u0141ukasiewicz supposes one accepts also the\nconverse implications \\(CpLp\\) and \\(CMpp\\), as one would from a\ndeterministic point of view. That gives the equivalences \\(EpLp\\) and\n\\(EpMp\\), which effectively collapse modal distinctions. Now add in\nthe idea that possibility is two-sided: if something is possible, then\nso is its negation: \\(EMpMNp\\). From these it immediately follows that\n\\(EpNp\\), and this is paradoxical in two-valued logic. The way out, as\n\u0141ukasiewicz portrays it, is to uncollapse the modal distinctions,\nnot by rejecting any of the principles above but by finding a case\nwhere \\(EpNp\\) is true. We entertain the idea of the\nproposition \\(Mp\\) being true when \\(p\\) is neither true nor false. In\naddition to the truth-values true (1) and\nfalse (0), allow then a third value,\npossible, which we write\n\u2018\\(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\)\u2019, so that when \\(p\\) is neither true nor\nfalse, it is possible, and so is its negation \\(Np\\), for if \\(Np\\)\nwere true, \\(p\\) would be false, and vice versa. If \\(Epq\\) is true\nwhen \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have the same truth-value, then when \\(p\\) is\npossible (we write \u2018\\(\\tval{p}\\)\u2019 for the truth-value of\n\\(p\\), so \\(\\tval{p}=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\)) we have \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n& \\tval{EpNp} = \\tval{E \\tfrac{1}{2} \\tfrac{1}{2}} = 1 \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nThis is, with minor changes, the way in which \u0141ukasiewicz\nintroduces the third value in his first published paper on the\nsubject, which bears the title \u201cOn the Concept of\nPossibility\u201d. This short paper is based on a talk given on 5\nJune 1920 in Lw\u00f3w. Two weeks later a second talk in the same\nplace was more transparently titled \u201cOn Three-Valued\nLogic\u201d. In this, \u0141ukasiewicz sets out principles governing\nimplication and equivalence involving the third value. These in effect\ndetermine the\n truth-tables[2]\n for these connectives:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(C\\)\n1\n\u00bd\n0 \n\n1\n1\n\u00bd\n0 \n\n\u00bd\n1\n1\n\u00bd \n\n0\n1\n1\n1  \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\\(E\\)\n1\n\u00bd\n0 \n\n1\n1\n\u00bd\n0 \n\n\u00bd\n\u00bd\n1\n\u00bd \n\n0\n0\n\u00bd\n1  \n   \n\n\nTogether with the assumed definitions of negation, conjunction and\ndisjunction as, respectively \n\\[ \\begin{align}\nNp & = Cp0 \\\\\n Apq & = CCpqq \\\\\n Kpq & = NANpNq \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nthis yields truth-tables for these connectives as\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(N\\)\n\u00a0 \n\n1\n0 \n\n\u00bd\n\u00bd \n\n0\n1  \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\\(A\\)\n1\n\u00bd\n0 \n\n1\n1\n1\n1 \n\n\u00bd\n1\n\u00bd\n\u00bd \n\n0\n1\n\u00bd\n0  \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\\(K\\)\n1\n\u00bd\n0 \n\n1\n1\n\u00bd\n0 \n\n\u00bd\n\u00bd\n\u00bd\n0 \n\n0\n0\n0\n0  \n   \n\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz proudly declares \u201cthat three-valued logic has,\nabove all, theoretical significance as the first attempt to create a\nnon-Aristotelian logic\u201d (PL, 18; SW, 88). What\nits practical significance is, he thinks awaits to be seen, and for\nthis we need \u201cto compare with experience the consequences of the\nindeterministic view which is the metaphysical basis of the new\nlogic\u201d (ibid.).\n",
