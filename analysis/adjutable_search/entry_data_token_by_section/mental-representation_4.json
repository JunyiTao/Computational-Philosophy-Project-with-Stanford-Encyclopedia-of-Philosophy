    "main_text": "Content Determination\n6. Content Determination\n\nThe contents of mental representations are typically taken to be\nabstract objects (properties, relations, propositions, sets, etc.). A\npressing question, especially for the naturalist, is how mental\nrepresentations come to have their contents. Here the issue is not how\nto naturalize content (abstract objects can\u2019t be\nnaturalized), but, rather, how to specify naturalistic\ncontent-determining relations between mental representations\nand the abstract objects they express. There are two basic types of\ncontemporary naturalistic theories of content-determination and\ncausal-informational and\n functional.[3]\n\nCausal-informational theories (Dretske 1981, 1988, 1995) hold that the\ncontent of a mental representation is grounded in the information it\ncarries about what does (Devitt 1996) or would\n(Fodor 1987, 1990a) cause it to\n occur.[4]\n There is, however, widespread agreement that causal-informational\nrelations are not sufficient to determine the content of mental\nrepresentations. Such relations are common, but representation is not.\nTree trunks, smoke, thermostats and ringing telephones carry\ninformation about what they are causally related to, but they do not\nrepresent (in the relevant sense) what they carry information about. A\nmental representation can be caused by something it does not\nrepresent, and can represent something that has not caused it, whereas\nnothing can be caused by something that doesn\u2019t cause it.\n\nThe main attempts to specify what makes a causal-informational state a\nmental representation are Asymmetric Dependency Theories\n(e.g., Fodor 1987, 1990a, 1994) and Teleological Theories\n(Dretske 1988, 1995, Fodor 1990b, Millikan 1984, Neander 2017,\nPapineau 1987). The Asymmetric Dependency Theory distinguishes merely\ninformational relations from representational relations on the basis\nof their higher-order relations to each other: informational relations\ndepend upon representational relations, but not vice versa. For\nexample, if tokens of a mental state type are reliably caused by\nhorses, cows-on-dark-nights, zebras-in-the-mist and Great Danes, then\nthey carry information about horses, etc. If, however, such tokens are\ncaused by cows-on-dark-nights, etc. because they were caused\nby horses, but not vice versa, then they represent horses (or the\nproperty horse).\n\nAccording to Teleological Theories, representational relations are\nthose a representation-producing mechanism has the selected\n(by evolution or learning) function of establishing. For\nexample, zebra-caused horse-representations do not mean\nzebra, because the mechanism by which such tokens are\nproduced has the selected function of indicating horses, not zebras.\nThe horse-representation-producing mechanism that responds to zebras\nis malfunctioning.\n\nSee the entries on\n  teleological theories of mental content\n and\n  causal theories of mental content.\n\nFunctional theories (Block 1986, Harman 1973), hold that the content\nof a mental representation is determined, at least in part, by its\n(causal, computational, inferential) relations to other mental\nrepresentations. They differ on whether relata should include all\nother mental representations or only some of them, and on whether to\ninclude external states of affairs. The view that the content of a\nmental representation is determined by its inferential/computational\nrelations with all other representations is holism;\nthe view it is determined by relations to only some other\nmental states is localism (or molecularism). (The\nnon-functional view that the content of a mental state depends on\nnone of its relations to other mental states is\natomism.) Functional theories that recognize no\ncontent-determining external relata have been called\nsolipsistic (Harman 1987). Some theorists posit distinct\nroles for internal and external connections, the former determining\nsemantic properties analogous to sense, the latter determining\nsemantic properties analogous to reference (McGinn 1982, Sterelny\n1989).\n\n(Reductive) representationalists (Dretske, Lycan, Tye) usually take\none or another of these theories to provide an explanation of the\n(non-conceptual) content of experiential states. They thus tend to be\nexternalists (see the next section) about phenomenological as well as\nconceptual content. Phenomenalists and non-reductive\nrepresentationalists (Block, Chalmers, Loar, Peacocke, Siewert), on\nthe other hand, take it that the representational content of such\nstates is (at least in part) determined by their intrinsic phenomenal\nproperties. Further, those who advocate a phenomenally-based approach\nto conceptual content (Horgan and Tienson, Kriegel, Loar,\nPitt, Searle, Siewert) also seem to be committed to internalist\nindividuation of the content (if not the reference) of such\nstates.\n\nPersistent indeterminacy problems with\ncausal-informational-teleological theories of content determination\nhave motivated a growing number of (analytic) philosophers to seek a\ndifferent approach, grounded not in external relations of\nrepresentational states but in their intrinsic phenomenal properties.\nThis approach has come to be known as the \u201cPhenomenal\nIntentionality Research Program\u201d (Kriegel 2013), or, simply\n\u201cPhenomenal Intentionality.\u201d These philosophers (including\nBourget, Kriegel, Loar, Mendelovici, Montague, Pitt, Searle, Smithies\n(2012, 2013a and b, 2019), Strawson and Siewert), argue that\ncausal-informational-teleological relations cannot yield the\nfine-grained, determinate content conceptual and perceptual\nrepresentations possess, and that such content can only be delivered\nby phenomenal character. The cognitive phenomenology thesis (discussed\nabove) is an important component of this overall approach. \n",
