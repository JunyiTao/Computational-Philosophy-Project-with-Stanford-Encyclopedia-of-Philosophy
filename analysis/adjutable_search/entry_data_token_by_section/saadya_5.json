    "main_text": "Prooftexts, Revelation and Faith\n6. Prooftexts, Revelation and Faith\n\n In further support of a sense in which Saadya identifies revelation\nas a ground, we may look to the very methodology and structure of the\nAm\u00e2n\u00e2t itself. In particular, consider the\nAm\u00e2n\u00e2t's liberal employment of Biblical prooftexts:\nevery reason-exemplifying analysis or argument is, within Saadya's\nwork, ultimately rooted in a scriptural verse.  Beckoning, we might\nsay, to the lived experience of faith (as opposed to the important,\nthough limited, cognitive experience of reason), these prooftexts\nthemselves stand as testaments to both the centrality and\nphenomenological uniqueness of \u2018knowing by tradition\u2019 (or,\nrevelation) in Saadya's world-view.  Evocative and transformative in\ntheir scope, these Biblical verses are themselves revelations \u2014\nand enactments \u2014 of faith in the very fabric of Saadya's\nreason-based endeavor. In this way, we may say that the method and\nform of Saadya's writing (viz. his use of prooftexts in\naddition to his use of reasoned arguments) helps emphasize the\nimportance for Saadya of revelation and knowledge-from-tradition as\nseparate from reason-based knowing. As such, we may say in particular\nof those Biblical prooftexts employed by Saadya in support of the\nimportance of reasoning, that they simultaneously (one might even\nsay, paradoxically) beckon us to (a) the limitations of reasoning, (b)\nthe need for (and consistency with reason of) revealed Knowledge, and\neven (c) the need to ground a life of reasoned reflection in a life of\nrevealed tradition. Through his constant engagement with revealed\ntexts to support the importance of reason, Saadya, in the very act of\nchampioning reason, can be seen as planting reason on the ground of\nrevelation. \n\n Saadya's liberal peppering of his analyses and arguments with\nBiblical prooftexts can in this way be seen as incarnations of faith\nin his text, incarnations which speak volumes about his complex\nunderstanding of reason's relation to revelation. It would seem that\nfaith \u2014 and not simply reason \u2014 runs throughout and\ngrounds Saadya's text, itself a model for Saadya's conception of the\nwell-lived life.\n",
