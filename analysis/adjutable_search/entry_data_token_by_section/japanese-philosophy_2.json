    "main_text": "Hallmarks of Japanese Philosophical Analysis || Holographic Relation between Whole and Part\n2.2 Holographic Relation between Whole and Part\n\nModels of reality built on external relations often resemble a mosaic\nin which individual entities are like tiles whose meaning in relation\nto the whole can only be determined by applying an extrinsic blueprint\nor template representing the external relations linking them. Each\nindividual tile in itself gives little or no information about how it\nrelates to other tiles. By contrast, models of reality built on\ninternal relations are typically more like jigsaw puzzles in which we\ndiscover the relation of one piece to another by looking more closely\nat the information already within each individual piece: its\nprotuberances, indentations, and coloration. Each piece has within it\nthe information about how it links with its adjacent pieces. In some\ninstances the configuration within the internal relation is even more\nrevealing such that each piece has information not only about adjacent\npieces, but also about all the other pieces in the whole.\nThat paradigm can be called holographic in the etymological\nsense that the whole (holo-) is considered to be inscribed\n(-graph) in each of its parts. That is, the whole is not\nsimply made of its parts, but also, each part contains the pattern or\nconfiguration of the whole of which it is a part. Such holographic\nrelations between whole and part are common in Japanese philosophical\nsystems.\n\nIn the West the holographic paradigm permeated animistic cultures\ntracing back to prehistoric times and persisted in the later magical\narts wherein a fingernail or hair could give a wizard or witch power\nover the whole person from which the part was pilfered. It continued\nin the cult of relics throughout the Middle Ages. But the\nEnlightenment\u2019s rationalism stripped the holographic paradigm of\nits ontological connections, restricting it to being no more than a\nfigure of speech (such as a metonym) or other form of conventionalized\nsymbol. In general the Western intellectual tradition limited\nholographic thinking to the literary (e.g., William Blake\u2019s\nuniverse in a grain of sand) and the psychological (e.g.,\nFreud\u2019s symbolic dream analysis), rather than the\nphilosophical.\n\nMore recently, however, in a scientific world increasingly attracted\nto frames of recursiveness, fractals, the multiple expressions of stem\ncells, and so forth, the holographic paradigm has once again begun to\nhave ontological and not just figurative relevance in the West. To a\nforensic scientist, for example, a drop of blood or a single hair from\na crime scene, is not only part of a person\u2019s anatomy, but is\nalso an item inscribed with the dna pattern of\nthe person\u2019s entire anatomy. The relevant contrast is that in\nthe history of Japanese thought the holographical paradigm of the\nwhole-inscribed-in-each-of-its-parts never went out of philosophical\nfashion as having potentially ontological significance. It was never\ndemoted to the status of being only a primitive, magical, or\nmetaphorical way of engaging the world. Indeed, holographic relations\noften figure prominently in many Japanese philosophical theories.\n\nTwo Western misinterpretations of the political theory behind\nJapan\u2019s imperial polity illustrate the point. In the nineteenth\nand early twentieth centuries, when Westerners first encountered the\nJapanese ideology of the emperor, they noted the emperor was referred\nto as kami, a term translated as \u201cgod\u201d when it\nrefers to a celestial deity. The (mistaken) inference was that the\nJapanese believed the emperor, like Yahweh or Zeus, was deemed to be a\ntranscendent being in an external relation to the state and the people\nin it. That interpretation missed the internal relation between the\nemperor and the Japanese people that establishes their logical\ninseparability such that neither could maintain its full identity\nwithout the other. Thus, in the logic of the kamikaze pilot,\ndying for the emperor was not a simple act of sacrificing one\u2019s\nself to a higher being or even a higher value. Instead, to die for the\nemperor could not be completely separated from dying for oneself and\ndying for all other Japanese. To deny that connection would reduce the\npilot to a crescent of his full identity, that is, for him to die for\nthe emperor was an act of self-fulfillment rather than\nself-sacrifice.\n\nThe second misunderstanding of the political theory behind the\nimperial system arose later in the twentieth century with Western\nintellectual historians influenced by Hayden White's theory of\nhistorical discourse and its analysis of tropes (White 1973). One\nclaim was that in the nineteenth century Japanese Native Studies\n(Kokugaku) had developed a new form of historical narrative centering\non the trope of kokutai. The emperor is the body,\nessence, or formation (tai) of the\ncountry, nation, and its people\n(koku). Thus the term kokutai applies to both the\nemperor and to Japan. The new ideological narrative, the critics\nclaimed, deceptively used a metonym (the emperor as a part of the\nstate used to symbolize the state) to claim the emperor is\nthe state (Harootunian 1978). Despite its virtues on other counts\n(see the entry on \n philosophy of history, section 3.4),\nmetahistorical criticism ill fits the Japanese situation inasmuch as\nit overlooks the long-standing Japanese emphasis on internal and\nholographic relations. That is, the internal relation between emperor\nand Japan establishes a holographic relation such that each person\ncontains the configuration of the whole Japanese nation. From the\nstandpoint of the traditional Japanese kokutai theory, to\nclaim the emperor is really only a symbol or metonym for Japan is a\ncategory mistake comparable to saying the dna\nfound in the blood at the crime scene is only a symbol or metonym for\nthe perpetrator. The philosophical claim (leaving aside here the truth\nvalue of that claim) is that the relations among the emperor, the\nJapanese people, and the state are comparable to the relations among\nthe dna, the blood, and the person from the\ncrime scene. It is simply a false premise (and certainly not one\nassumed in the history of Japanese thought) that there is no possible\nsense in which the whole can be contained in one of its parts and that\nany such claim must be no more than a trope.\n\nAnother area where ignorance of Japanese holographic thinking has led\nto Western misinterpretation is in the so-called aesthetic of\nminimalism. Once we are attuned to the holographic paradigm it becomes\nclear that Japanese minimalism is not about eliminating the extraneous\nor omitting the unnecessary, but rather (as in the case of the\nforensic scientist) about focusing on the particular as revealing the\nwhole from which it was taken. If we recall that the Japanese work of\nart is the creative presentation of the kokoro (the total\ninteractive field that generates the artist, medium, and audience as a\nsingle event) then what is normally considered in the West to be the\nwork of art is that precise point in the kokoro through which\nwe can experience the configuration of the whole of the\nkokoro. Japanese minimalism does not exclude or eliminate; by\nfocusing on the particular it enables us to attend to the whole\naesthetic event that produces it and of which it is a part. To the\ndiscerning reader, the haiku with its meager seventeen\nsyllables omits nothing; rather, it is holographic of the whole.\n",
