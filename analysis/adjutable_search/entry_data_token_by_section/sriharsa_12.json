    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind || Self-Knowledge\n4.1 Self-Knowledge\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s view, in a nutshell, is this. All\nconscious mental occurrences are self-intimating: when\nsomeone is undergoing a conscious mental occurrence, that very mental\noccurrence constitutes a veridical awareness of itself. Therefore, an\nagent needs nothing other than a conscious mental occurrence in order\nto know consciousness is ultimately real. In this respect,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a endorses a form of reflexivism, a\nview commonly associated with the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school of Indian\nBuddhism, on which conscious mental states are reflexively aware of\nthemselves (Ganeri 1995, 2012; Williams 1998; Yao 2005; Arnold 2005;\nGarfield 2006; MacKenzie 2007, 2008; Thompson 2011; Kellner 2011;\nCoseru 2012: Ch. 8).\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a opens his defense of reflexivism with the\nfollowing argument (KKh 41\u201342). Whenever a person undergoes a\nconscious mental occurrence, she neither doubts whether she is\nundergoing that mental occurrence, nor does she mistake that mental\noccurrence for a different one, nor does she become sure of its\nabsence. So, the agent must have a veridical awareness that the\nrelevant mental occurrence exists. Now, suppose conscious mental\noccurrences don\u2019t constitute an awareness of themselves. Hence,\nan agent can only become awareness of such conscious mental\noccurrences by some other means, e.g., on the basis of some episode of\nhigher-order awareness. If this were the case, then it would be\npossible for the first-order conscious mental occurrence to be present\nwithout there being any higher-order awareness of it. But then the\nagent could doubt or be mistaken about whether she is undergoing the\nrelevant conscious mental occurrence. In order to block this\nconclusion, therefore, we must accept the conclusion that conscious\nmental occurrences constitute a veridical awareness of their own\nexistence. An agent needs nothing further in order to know that such\noccurrences are ultimately real.\n\nHowever, this argument doesn\u2019t seem great. The\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher, who thinks that our\nawareness of our conscious mental occurrences always involves an\nepisode of introspective higher-order awareness, could offer a\ndifferent explanation of why we cannot doubt or be wrong about whether\nwe are undergoing certain conscious mental occurrences. She could say\nthat whenever an agent is in a conscious mental state, there is a\nveridical higher-order awareness-episode in virtue of which the agent\nis aware that she is undergoing the relevant mental occurrence.\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a responds to this objection with a regress\nargument. Suppose an agent is undergoing a conscious mental\noccurrence. Ordinarily, when we are aware of a conscious mental\noccurrence, we are also aware that we are aware of it, we are aware\nthat we are aware that we are aware of it, and so on. Since the\n\u201chigher-order awareness\u201d (henceforth, HOA) theorist\nexplains such awareness of one\u2019s own mental occurrences by\nappealing to episodes of higher-order awareness, she faces a choice:\neither she should posit an infinite hierarchy of such episodes of\nhigher-order awareness, or she shouldn\u2019t. If she takes the\nsecond route, she would have to say that for any conscious mental\noccurrence, an agent is aware of that conscious mental occurrence, and\naware that she is aware of that mental occurrence, and aware that she\nis aware that she is aware of that mental occurrence,\u2026, and so\non, until she reaches some higher-order awareness-episode which isn't\nthe object of any further higher-order awareness-episode. But if that\nis the case, the agent can indeed doubt whether that final\nhigher-order awareness-episode exists. On that basis, she can doubt\nthe existence of the higher-order awareness-episode that the final\nhigher-order awareness-episode has as its object, and so on. In this\nway, the agent can indeed come to doubt whether she is undergoing to\nthe relevant conscious mental occurrence. Therefore, the HOA theorist\nmust posit an infinite hierarchy of higher-order awareness episodes.\nBut then there will be a regress. So, the HOA awareness theorist\ncannot really explain why conscious mental occurrences are immune to\ndoubt (KKh 43).\n\nThis regress argument isn\u2019t airtight either: the HOA theorist\nmight just reject the premise that conscious mental occurrences are\nnot subject to doubt or error. She might just be comfortable with the\nclaim that sometimes, even though we are undergoing a certain\nconscious mental occurrence, we are not aware that we are undergoing\nthat conscious mental occurrence. \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a thinks that\nthis move will be difficult to pull off.\n\nIn response, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a offers an argument that starts\nout from the following principle:\n\n\nawareness-existence principle If an agent\nis not aware of her own awareness-episode e, then she cannot\nrationally ascertain that the object that e is about\n exists.[23]\n\n\n\nThe awareness-existence principle is a\nprinciple about rationality: it says that a rational\n(pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ika) agent\u2014i.e., someone who\ndoesn\u2019t overstep the bounds of her evidence\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a)\u2014cannot be sure that the object of\nher awareness exists if she is not aware of her own awareness. This is\nbecause in order to ascertain the existence of the object of her\nawareness, the rational agent will have to cite evidence for the\nexistence of that object. But in the absence of any awareness of her\nawareness, she won\u2019t be able to appeal to her own awareness as\nevidence for the existence of the object. As a result, she won\u2019t\nbe able to ascertain that the relevant object exists.\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s final argument is this (KKh\n45\u201346). It is uncontroversial that even in rational agents,\nconscious awareness-episodes can be action-guiding: a\nrational agent\u2019s conscious awareness of an object is capable of\nmaking her engage in physical and linguistic behavior under the\npresupposition that the relevant object exists. For instance, a\nrational agent\u2019s perceptual experience as of there being a chair\nbefore her could motivate her to perform certain chair-related\nlinguistic and physical acts, e.g., saying, \u201cThat\u2019s a\nchair!\u201d, or trying to grab the chair and sit on it. However, if\nthe agent weren\u2019t aware of her experience as of there being a\nchair before her, then, by the awareness-existence\nprinciple, she couldn\u2019t ascertain that there is a chair\nbefore her. And if she couldn\u2019t ascertain the existence of the\nchair, the relevant patterns of physical and linguistic behavior\nwouldn\u2019t arise. The upshot is that if object-directed conscious\nawareness-episodes, e.g., perceptual experiences, are to be\naction-guiding in the case of rational agents, rational agents must be\naware of such mental occurrences whenever they take place. \n\nBut now, if this awareness of awareness is an episode of higher-order\nawareness (as the HOA theorist intends it to be), then there will be a\nregress (KKh 45\u201346). Unless the HOA theorist posits an infinite\nhierarchy of awareness-episodes, by the awareness-existence\nprinciple, no rational agent\nwill be able to ascertain the existence of her initial\nawareness-episode, and therefore also won\u2019t be able to ascertain\nthe existence of its object. Since that\u2019s bad, the HOA theorist\nhas to accept the conclusion that at least all object-directed\nconscious awareness-episodes of rational agents involve awareness of\nthemselves. But if the HOA theorist is comfortable with this\nconclusion, it might just be better for her to accept the more general\nthesis that all awareness-episodes (or even conscious mental\noccurrences) involve awareness of themselves.\n",
