    "main_text": "Knowledge and Perception || Sensory perception\n3.2 Sensory perception\n\nLet\u2019s turn now to Austin\u2019s views specifically about\nperception\n ((5) and (6) above).\n Once we have detailed the facts on which a perception-based judgment\nof ours relies, a more general challenge arises concerning our access\nto those facts. In order to exploit the bird\u2019s head shape as the\nbasis for our judgment that it is a goldfinch, it is arguable that we\nmust be able to see (or perhaps feel) the bird and its shape. On some\nviews of perception, however, birds and their shapes are not amongst\nthe things that one can perceive. Austin\u2019s main aim in Sense\n& Sensibilia is to undermine considerations that have been\noffered in favour of the general doctrine that, as he puts it,\n\n\n\u2026we never see or otherwise perceive (or \u201csense\u201d),\nor anyhow we never directly perceive or sense, material\nobjects (or material things), but only sense-data (or our own ideas,\nimpressions, sense, sense-perceptions, percepts, &c.). (1962a:\n2)\n\n\nCentral to those considerations are those organized by versions of\nwhat is known as the argument from illusion\n ((6) above).[21]\n The version of the argument that Austin criticizes can be\nreconstructed as follows. (i) There are cases of illusion in which we\nhave a sensory experience as of seeing something of some sort with\nspecific features but in which nothing has those specific features.\nThis might be because, although we experience something of the sort in\nquestion, the thing we experience lacks the features in question; or\nit might be because we don\u2019t experience a thing of the sort in\nquestion at all. (ii) In those cases, there must be something we\nexperience that has the features in question. Call the things we\nexperience in such cases sense-data. (iii) Since the cases in\nwhich we experience sense-data include cases in which no material\nthings of the sort in question, or with the features in question, are\nexperienced, it follows that sense-data are not (in general) material\nthings, or elements in the environment independent of the individual\nexperiencer. It follows that, in the cases in question, we experience\nthings (or directly experience things) that are distinct from\nmaterial things and we do not thereby experience (or directly\nexperience) material things. (iv) Now it is a general principle about\nexperiences that if we cannot discriminate the objects of two\nexperiences on the basis of introspection, then those experiences must\nhave objects of the same sort. Hence, if one experience has only\nsense-data as its objects, and not material things, and a second\nexperience has as its objects something that we cannot discriminate on\nthe basis of introspection from the objects of the first experience,\nthen the second experience also has sense-data rather than material\nthings as its objects. (v) Since every experience stands in the\nrequired relation to an experience with only sense-data as its\nobjects, every experience has sense-data rather than material things\nas its objects. Hence, we never experience\u2014or never\ndirectly experience\u2014material things\n\nAustin objects to every step in the argument just reconstructed.\nAmongst other complaints, he argues that key terms in the argument\nhave not been properly defined or explained\u2014for instance,\n\u201cmaterial thing\u201d and \u201csense-data\u201d (1962a: 4,\n7\u201314, 55), and \u201cdirectly\u201d (1962a: 14\u201319). And\nhe objects to the general principle, to which appeal was made in (iv),\npointing out that there are no grounds for thinking that we cannot\nhave experiences with different kinds of object that we nonetheless\ncan\u2019t discriminate on the basis of introspection. For instance,\nwe might experience a bar of soap that looks just like a lemon, and be\nin a position where we couldn\u2019t discriminate the soap from the\nlemon on the basis of introspection. Nonetheless, we would hold that\nthe two experiences have different kinds of objects (1962a:\n 50\u201352).[22]\n However, what are perhaps his most important complaints target (i)\nand (ii) by exploiting the distinction, initially articulated in\n\u201cOther Minds\u201d (1946), between two elements in perceptually\nbased judgment: the opportunity afforded by sensory perception and\njudgmental acumen.\n\nThe distinction between sensory perception and judgmental acumen\nenables Austin to distinguish between central cases of\nillusion and central cases of delusion, and also to\nsketch explanations of what is going on in those cases that do not\nmake appeal to sense-data. Austin takes the defender of (i) and (ii)\nto argue as follows. First, consider an illusion, for example a stick\nthat looks bent but really isn\u2019t. Such an illusion has two key\nfeatures. First, it clearly involves a distinctive sensory experience.\nSecond, the distinctive sensory experience that it involves is apt to\ngive rise to an erroneous perceptual judgment, to the effect that the\nstick is bent. Now one way of explaining the erroneous perceptual\njudgment is to view it as dictated by the sensory\nexperience\u2014that is, to view it as accurately representing\nfeatures presented in the experience: the bent-ness of that which is\nexperienced. Since the stick is not in fact bent, and that\nwhich is experienced is bent, we have reason to claim that\nthat which is experienced is not identical with the stick. What we\nexperience is sense-data rather than a stick. Moreover, we\nmight also consider more extreme cases in which we make erroneous\nperceptual judgments: cases of delusion or hallucination. For example,\nthere is the case in which an alcoholic person judges that pink rats\nare visible, when in fact there are none. Now, given the proposed\naccount of the case of illusion, that case cannot be distinguished\nfrom the case of delusion by appeal to the fact that, in the former,\nan environmental feature is experienced while, in the latter, there is\nno suitable environmental feature to be experienced. It therefore\nseems natural to treat the two cases as of the same basic type, and to\noffer the same type of explanation for both. Thus, one might be\ntempted to view the rat-delusion as having the following three\nfeatures. First, it involves a distinctive sensory experience. Second,\nthe distinctive sensory experience that it involves dictates\nan erroneous perceptual judgment to the effect that pink rats are\nvisible. Third, that judgment is dictated because it accurately\nrepresents features present in the experience.\n\nAustin responds as follows. First, he exploits the role of judgmental\nacumen in perceptual judgment in order to provide an alternative\nexplanation of cases of illusion (or more generally of things looking\nways that they are not). He allows that some things really do\nlook the way they are sometimes taken to be\u2014the stick\nlooks bent, even though it is not in fact bent. But he holds that\nthose looks are not private features of individual\u2019s\nexperiences. For example, they are available to other perceivers and\nmight be recorded in a photograph. (Austin discusses talk about how\nthings look, and distinguishes it from talk about how things\nseem\u2014which he associates with judgment rather than with\nexperience, in Sense and Sensibilia (1962a: 33\u201343). See\nalso Jackson 1977: 30\u201349; Martin 2010; Travis 2004.) However,\nthe way the stick looks, just as much as features like the\nstick\u2019s straightness, can be the basis for perceptual judgments.\nWe can explain why someone is prone to judge that the stick is bent by\nappeal to the stick\u2019s looking bent, rather to\nanything\u2019s being bent, together with the ways in which exercises\nof judgmental acumen can respond erroneously to looks. More generally,\nthere needn\u2019t be anything in particular\u2014any specific\nfeature of what is experienced or any specific look\u2014that figures\nin explaining why individuals are prone to make a specific type of\njudgment on the basis of the experience. For the explanation for each\nindividual\u2019s judgment will depend, not only on what they\nexperience, but also on the types of judgmental capacities that they\nhave. In support of this form of explanation, Austin notes that not\neveryone would be inclined to judge that the stick is bent. For\nexample, noting the presence of water, those whose judgmental\ncapacities are sufficiently well trained might withhold judgment about\nthe stick\u2019s shape (Hinton 1973: 114ff includes a useful\ndiscussion of some of Austin\u2019s claims about illusions).\n\nStandard cases of illusion or misleading appearance of the sort\nwe\u2019ve just considered involve sensory experiences of ordinary\nthings and their features, including their looks, feels, and so forth.\nHowever, because the connection between what is experienced and what\none judges on its basis is not straightforward\u2014because\njudgmental acumen is involved in moving from one to the\nother\u2014there is no general way to read back from the judgments\nsomeone is prone to make to specific features of their sensory\nexperiences. Because such cases of illusion involve experience of\nordinary things, while standard cases of delusion do not, we thus have\na ground on which to distinguish the two sorts of case. For example,\nwe have grounds to distinguish the case in which someone erroneously\njudges that a submerged stick is bent from the case of the alcoholic\nperson who judges that pink rats are visible. But having distinguished\nthe cases in that way, we are liable to become open to two new\nquestions. First, should we allow that the judgment in the delusory\ncase is based on sensory experience? Perhaps, for example, some cases\nof delusion involve dysfunction in the systems responsible for\nperceptual judgment of a sort that give rise to perceptual judgments\nin the absence of any sense-experiential basis for those judgments.\nSecond, even if we allow that a particular delusory judgment is based\nupon sensory experience, should we allow that it involves sensory\nexperience of anything other than elements that are present in the\ndeluded subject\u2019s environment? Perhaps some cases of delusion\ninvolve dysfunctional judgmental responses to what is seen or heard.\nFor example, an alcoholic subject judgment that a pink rat is visible\nmight be a disordered response to an experience of a shadow. Unless we\nare forced to answer both questions affirmatively, we lack the basis\nfor an argument that the deluded subject experiences anything distinct\nfrom the ordinary things and features that they can see, hear,\netc.\n\nAustin doesn\u2019t suggest that there could be no grounds for giving\naffirmative answers to either of those questions. Moreover, it is very\nplausible that such grounds can be provided. It is plausible,\nfor example, that there are distinctive sensory experiences involved\nin what we call seeing double, or seeing afterimages, that cannot be\nexplained simply by appeal to what is present in subjects\u2019\nenvironments. And it is plausible that genuine sensory hallucinations\nare possible\u2014indeed, it is plausible that such hallucinations\nmight figure in explaining the alcoholic person\u2019s judgment.\nHowever, although the style of response just considered is indecisive\nagainst such additional developments of the argument, the resources\nthat it deploys will surely figure in serious engagement with those\ndevelopments. Austin sketches an approach to issues raised by such\nexperiences by attempting to give an account of the reports we are\ninclined to make in such cases\u2014\u201cI see two pieces of\npaper\u201d, \u201cI see pink rats\u201d. Austin\u2019s sketch\naims to explain how such reports can be non-committal about the nature\nof the experiences so-reported, and in particular about whether such\nexperiences have objects at all (1962a: 84\u2013103). It is here in\nparticular that Austin comes close to endorsing a form of\ndisjunctivism about perception (see Soteriou 2009).\n\n(For critical engagement with Austin\u2019s work on perception, see\nAyer 1967, 1969; Burnyeat 1979; Firth 1964; Forguson 1969b; Garvey\n2014; Hinton 1973: 114ff; Hirst 1963; Jackson 1977; Travis and\nKalderon 2013; Leite 2011; Longworth 2019, Marion 2000a,b; Martin ms (Other Internet\nResources), 2000, 2010; Pears 1979; Putnam 1994; Schwartz 2004, 2018;\nSnowdon 2014; Soames 2003: 171\u2013193; Thau 2004; Travis 2004; van\nHulst and Cresswell 2016; Warnock 1989: 11\u201331.)\n",
