    "main_text": "The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika Concepts of Universal, Inherence, and Basic Differentium || Universals\n10.1 Universals\n\nThe Manual of Reason reports the standard\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika definition of a universal\n(s\u0101m\u0101nya, j\u0101ti):\n\nA universal is something which is (i) eternal, (ii) unitary, and (iii)\nlocated in a plurality of things (substances, qualities or motions).\n(TS 82)\n\n\nUniversals are thus conceived of as unstructured, objective properties\nwhich necessarily reside in individuals. The postulation of such\nentities in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika schema has explanatory force,\naccounting for the distinction between \u2018natural\u2019 and\n\u2018conventional\u2019 classifications. Intuitively, this is the\ndistinction between groupings such as the class of cows or horses,\nwhich reflect natural divisions (\u201ccut nature at the\njoints\u201d), and those such as the class of Cabinet Ministers or\nthe class of endangered species, which reflect anthropocentric\nconcerns. The Naiy\u0101yikas mark this distinction by calling natural\nproperties \u201cuniversals\u201d (j\u0101ti) and\nanthropocentric properties \u201cimposed\u201d or\n\u201cnominal\u201d properties (up\u0101dhi).\nCorrelatively, a semantic distinction is drawn between \u201cnatural\nkind terms\u201d (naimittik\u012b), i.e. terms the basis for\nwhose application is a universal, and \u201cimposed kind\nterms\u201d, terms whose basis for application is an anthropocentric\nproperty. Udayana tried to make this distinction more precise by\ngiving a list of criteria for a property to count as natural.\nExamination of his list (which are called the\n\u201cj\u0101ti-b\u0101dhakas\u201d\u2014impediments\ndistinguishing natural properties) will reveal something further about\nthe nature of the natural properties according to Ny\u0101ya.\n\nThe six impediments are (1) \u2018non-plurality\u2019\u2014a\ngenuine universal must be plurally instantiated; (2)\n\u2018equipollence\u2019 (tulyatva)\u2014two co-extensive\nproperties cannot both be genuine universals; (3)\n\u2018cross-connection\u2019 (sa\u1e43kara)\u2014two\ngenuine universals must not partially overlap; (4)\n\u2018regress\u2019\u2014a property like universality cannot itself\nbe a universal, on pain of infinite regress (universality-hood, etc.\netc.); (5) a property like differentia-hood cannot be a genuine\nuniversal, for by definition the basic differentia share no common\nuniversal property; (6) a property like inherence-hood cannot be a\nuniversal, since it does not inhere in its loci. Of these six, the\nlast three are there basically to maintain the internal consistency of\nthe Vai\u015be\u1e63ika system, and the first is a straightforward\nconsequence of the definition of a universal. It debars a\nsingly-instanced properties such as space-hood from the status of\ngenuine natural kind, perhaps motivated by the thought that the very\nnature of a universal consists in its grounding judgements of the form\n\u201cx is of the same kind as y\u201d, which\npresuppose that there are at least two entities.\n\nThe second and third criteria are the most important, and can be\nstated more formally as follows. If P and Q are\ndistinct properties, then (equipollence, tulyatva):\n\n[P] = [Q] \u2192 either P or Q (or\nboth) is not a universal,\n\n\nwhere \u2018[P]\u2019 denotes the extension of P.\nThe contraposed form is:\n\nP and Q are universals \u2192 [P] \u2260\n[Q].\n\n\nNote that this does not entail that universal properties are\nextensionally individuated or equivalent to classes, as some have\nmaintained. It shows only that corresponding to each class, there is\nat most one universal. Although, within the domain of universals, a\nuniversal is uniquely determined by its extension, the distinction\nbetween a universal and a co-extensive imposed property (e.g. pothood\nand conch-shell-like-neck-hood) is an intensional distinction.\n\nAs for the third impediment (s\u0101\u1e43karya), if\nP and Q are distinct properties, then\n\n[P] partially overlaps [Q] \u2192 either P\nor Q (or both) is not a universal.\n\n\nThe contraposed form is:\n\nP and Q are universals \u2192 [P] \u2282\n[Q] or [P] \u2283 [Q] or [P] \u2229\n[Q] = \u2205.\n\n\n(The inclusion is strict because of the \u2018equipollence\u2019\nconstraint.) In other words, genuine universals are arranged in a\nhierarchy: given two universals, either they are related as genus and\nspecies, all instances of one being instances of the other, or else\nthey are completely disjoint, having no instance in common (e.g.\ncowhood-animalhood, cowhood-treehood). The Ny\u0101ya say that, if one\nuniversal is thus subsumed by another, the former is\n\u2018lower\u2019 (apara) and the latter is\n\u2018higher\u2019 (para) (cf. TS 6). The\n\u2018highest\u2019 universal of all is \u2018existentness\u2019\n(satt\u0101), into whose extension falls every substance,\nquality and motion. The demand that universals be organised\nhierarchically shows that the Ny\u0101ya took as their paradigm the\nbiological species, which tend to exhibit this structure. Bearing in\nmind that the term for \u201cuniversal\u201d, i.e.\n\u201cj\u0101ti\u201d is also the word for caste, Matilal\n(1971: 76) speculates that\n\n[O]ne might discover in the Ny\u0101ya doctrine of generic property a\nremote influence of the socio-religious ideas of the Brahmins.\nTranslated into biological terms, the \u2026 principle of\n\u2018non-overlapping\u2019 becomes a principle which opposes\ncross-breeding. There is thus some evidence that the Ny\u0101ya bias\nfor real generic properties was partly influenced by the Brahmanical\nconcept of an ideal social order where intermixture of classes is not\nto be permitted.\n\n\nSome Naiy\u0101yikas, especially Bh\u0101sarvaj\u00f1a and\nRaghun\u0101tha, reject the \u2018cross-connection\u2019 impediment,\npointing out the problems encountered trying to apply it to\nnon-biological natural kinds (e.g. redness and greenness overlap, as\ndo pothood and goldhood). Raghun\u0101tha suggests that consistent\napplication of this principle would eliminate virtually all universals\nfrom the ontology. Udayana\u2019s criterion of a property to be\n\u2018natural\u2019 is thus not a necessary one, and neither is it\nsufficient: none of his impediments shows why the pair\n\u2018blue-green\u2019 is more natural than Goodman\u2019s pair\n\u2018grue-bleen\u2019 (where x is grue iff x is green and examined\nbefore time t, and is blue otherwise, and vice versa for bleen.)\n\nThe idea that universals are, in some sense, \u2018located\u2019 in\nparticulars generated two distinctive objections to the theory.\nDi\u1e45n\u0101ga trades on the spatial metaphor to argue that the\nNy\u0101ya conception of universals is incoherent. For, if a universal\nis \u2018unitary\u2019, it can be located in at most one place, and\nthus not \u2018plurally instanced\u2019. If, conversely, if is\nlocated simultaneously at many places, that can only be because it has\nparts, each located at a different place, and hence is not\n\u2018unitary\u2019. This argument plays on the ambiguity of the\nnotion of \u2018being located\u2019, and pretends that a universal\nlike cowhood is located in individual cows in just the same sense that\na cow is located in a field. Nevertheless, it forces the Ny\u0101ya to\nbe more careful in its account of the universal-particular relation.\nAs The Manual of Reason notes (TS 84), a universal is said to\nreside in its instances by the relation of \u2018inherence\u2019\n(samav\u0101ya), defined as an \u201cinseparability\u201d\n(ayutasiddhi) relation. Of two entities, x and\ny,\n\nx is inseparable from y iff x cannot exist\nunless y exists.\n\n\nThe idea is that a cow cannot exist unless the universal cowhood\nexists, and that it is in this sense that cowhood is located in the\ncow. (The same relation is claimed to occur between non-repeatable\n\u2018qualities\u2019 (gu\u1e47a) and substances, a whole\nand its parts, and the basic differentia and the atoms.) Spatial\nlocation, on the other hand, involves a quite different relation,\nnamely contact (sa\u1e43yoga). In this way, the term\n\u2018location\u2019 is disambiguated.\n\nThe other problem is the classic one: what happens to a universal if\nall its instances are destroyed? Can universals exist without being\ninstantiated? The definition of the inherence relation permits this,\nfor the requirement is that cows cannot exist without cowhood, not\nvice versa. We might say that the cow\u2019s existence supervenes on\nthat of the universal cowhood. However, it is not so clear that we can\nsay in the same way that the parts (of a car, say) cannot exist unless\nthe whole (car) exists.\n",
