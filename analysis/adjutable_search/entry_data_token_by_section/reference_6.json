Roughly, they are expressions the reference\nof which appears to co-vary with certain very regular aspects of the\ncontexts in which they are used. Here, \u2018context\u2019 should be\nunderstood as incorporating, inter alia, a speaker, hearer,\ntime, and place. In contrast, the reference of \u2018impure\u2019\nindexicals is supposed to be more difficult to characterize in terms\nof picking out some distinct, repeatable feature of a context. While\nboth the existence and the significance of this distinction are\ncontroversial (see the entry on\n indexicals\n for further discussion; see also Radulescu (2018)), examples of each\nsort of term\u2014should the distinction prove both real and\nsignificant\u2014typically are not. Standard examples of pure\nindexicals include \u2018I\u2019, \u2018here\u2019,\n\u2018now\u2019, and arguably \u2018you\u2019. The list of impure\nindexicals, on the other hand, is generally agreed to include\n\u2018this\u2019, \u2018that\u2019, \u2018he\u2019,\n\u2018she\u2019, and \u2018it\u2019.\n\nThe traditional approach to indexicals, dating back once more to Frege\nand Russell, has it that the reference of such expressions is fixed by\nsome sort of descriptive content associated by the speaker with the\nexpression. This reference-fixing description is the meaning of a\ngiven utterance of the expression. The motivation for such a view is\nlargely intuitive. Indexicals certainly do appear to mean something,\nand their meanings presumably have something to do with how these\nexpressions refer. For instance, the meaning of \u2018I\u2019 is\narguably the speaker of this utterance and refers to that\nindividual; the meaning of \u2018now\u2019 is arguably the time\nof this utterance and refers to that time. And so on. \n\nOne obvious objection to this view is that what the term\n\u2018I\u2019 refers to does not appear to be sensitive to whatever\nsort of descriptive content a speaker might happen to associate with\nthat term. For instance, the fact that I might happen to associate the\ndescription the previous U.S. president with the term\n\u2018I\u2019 does not mean that I can somehow succeed in using the\nterm \u2018I\u2019 to refer to Barack Obama. Another problem with\nthis view, discussed extensively in Kaplan (1989b), is that taking\nthese reference-determining descriptions to be part of what we assert\nwhen we use indexicals can lead to our making some rather odd\npredictions. Consider an assertive utterance of: \n\nI am hungry.\n\n\nSuppose, first, that I am the speaker. I utter (8). Now, suppose that\nyou are the speaker. You utter (8). While there may be a sense in\nwhich we \u2018said the same thing\u2019\u2014that is, the sense\nin which we uttered the same sentence-type\u2014there is another\nsense in which we clearly did not. We could also put this as: we\nasserted very different things. And yet, according to the classical\ndescriptivist, we\u2019ve both asserted the very same thing. Namely, we\u2019ve\nboth asserted that the speaker is hungry. All that differs is the\ncontext in which we asserted this.\n\nNow, to be clear, there are ways of tinkering with the view to avoid\nboth these objections. Some, like Hans Reichenbach (1947) or more\nrecently Manuel Garcia-Carpintero (1998) and John Perry (2001), have\nargued that indexicals are \u2018token reflexives\u2019, meaning\nthat the descriptions that should be associated with them will need to\ninvolve explicit reference to the utterance of that very token use of\nthe term. So, for instance, the description for \u2018I\u2019 might\nbe: the speaker of this very token of \u2018I\u2019. Since different\ntokens will be involved when each of us utters (8), we\u2019ll no longer be\nasserting the very same thing. If we add that, for token indexicals at\nleast, the relevant descriptions aren\u2019t under the speaker\u2019s control,\nbut are rather associated with particular terms via the rules of\nlanguage, then we can avoid the former objection as well.\n\nA different sort of approach was developed by Reichenbach\u2019s student,\nDavid Kaplan. Kaplan (1989b) took many of the same elements that\nReichenbach was working with, but put them into a direct reference\nframework where the meaning of an indexical in context\u2014its\ncontribution to what is said or asserted\u2014is just an object.\nAccording to Kaplan, we need to distinguish between two types of\nmeaning, which he called \u2018character\u2019 and\n\u2018content\u2019. Content is basically what we have been calling\nmeaning to this point; it is what the utterance of an individual term\ncontributes to what is said or asserted by the utterance of a complete\nsentence of which it is a part. On direct reference theories, this is\nan object, thereby making the truth or falsity of what is said or\nasserted object-dependent. Character, on the other hand, is more akin\nto a rule of use; a character tells us, for any given context, what\nthe content of a given expression is. Names, on Kaplan\u2019s way of\nthinking about them, have constant characters: in any two arbitrary\ncontexts, uses of the same name will be mapped to the same referent\n(recall that Kaplan thinks of names in a fine-grained way, such that they\nare never shared). The rule for any name \u2018N\u2019 thus\nturns out to be: in any context whatsoever, return N as the\nreferent. Not so for terms like \u2018I\u2019 or \u2018here\u2019,\nwhich Kaplan takes to be associated with rules like return the\nspeaker and  return the location of the utterance. So in\na context where I am speaking in Foyle\u2019s, utterances of these\nindexicals will refer to me and to Foyle\u2019s, respectively. When you are\nspeaking at the American Bar, they will refer to you and to the\nAmerican Bar.\n\nImportantly, the characters of the pure indexicals are supposed to be\ninsensitive to speakers\u2019 mental states. That rules out any possibility\nof my using the term \u2018I\u2019 to refer to Barack Obama. Nor are\nyour and my utterances of (8) predicted to assert the same thing.\nWhat\u2019s more, as Kaplan points out, the view allows us to productively\ndistinguish between \u2018metaphysical\u2019 necessity and what\nKaplan calls \u2018logical\u2019 necessity. The sentence \u201cI am\nhere now,\u201d Kaplan claims, represents a logical necessity: in\nvirtue of what the indexicals \u2018I\u2019, \u2018here\u2019, and\n\u2018now\u2019 all mean, this sentence cannot be uttered falsely.\nYet clearly it is not necessary in any sort of metaphysical sense that\na particular speaker must be wherever she happens to be at the time of\nutterance; she could just as easily have been somewhere\n else.[7]\n\nNow we have three basic models of reference, of the metasemantics of\nreferential terms, on the table: the descriptivist model, the causal\nchain model, and the character model. With the last of these in view,\nwe can clarify an important aspect of the indexical theory of names\nthat was discussed at the end of the last section. Essentially, that\ntheory proposed to hybridize our second and third models. Instead of\nnames having constant characters, as Kaplan would have it, the\nproposal is to assign them more interesting ones. For instance, we\nmight try stipulating that the context, in addition to containing a\nspeaker, place, time, etc., must also include a most salient\nindividual bearing a given name. Names, the idea runs, always refer to\ntheir most salient bearer at a context. Since names no longer have\nconstant characters, they are more like indexicals than we might\ninitially have thought. On the other hand, we can preserve a good\namount of the causal theory by re-characterizing it as a theory about\nwho counts as a name-bearer in a given\n context.[8]\n\n\nThis way of developing the indexical theory is not without its\ndownsides, however. For instance, it hardly seems to be true that we\nalways use names to refer to the most salient bearer of that name in a\ncontext, particularly once we consider utterances of names prefixed\nwith phrases like \u2018the other\u2019 (e.g. \u201cThe other David\nis not here yet, though I can hear him down the hall.\u201d). What\u2019s\nmore, there is reason to worry that embracing this sort of indexical\ntheory entails giving up on one of the purported advantages of the\ncausal theory: its ability to explain how it is that we can pass on\nthe capacity to think about objects merely by passing on names for\nthose objects. Since names are causally anchored to the objects they\nname, according to the causal theory, acquiring a new name should\nsuffice to put us in causal contact with the object named. On the\nindexical theory of names, on the other hand, we do not pass on names\nfor things; rather, we use names to refer to the most salient bearer\nof that name in a given context. Perhaps this suffices to pass on a\nuse of a name\u2014loaded, as it were, with a \nreferent\u2014where the listener doesn\u2019t already have that use in her\nrepertoire. But if the listener fails to have this use in her\nrepertoire, then it becomes hard to see how the referent of that use\ncould count as the most salient bearer of the relevant name in the\ncontext. \n",
