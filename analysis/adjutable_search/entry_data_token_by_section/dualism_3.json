    "main_text": "Varieties of Dualism: Ontology || Property Dualism\n2.2 Property Dualism\n\n\nWhereas predicate dualism says that there are two essentially\ndifferent kinds of predicates in our language,\nproperty dualism says that there are two essentially different kinds of\nproperty out in the world. Property dualism can be seen as a\nstep stronger than predicate dualism. Although the predicate\n\u2018hurricane\u2019 is not equivalent to any single description\nusing the language of physics, we believe that each individual\nhurricane is nothing but a collection of physical atoms\nbehaving in a certain way: one need have no more than the physical\natoms, with their normal physical properties, following normal physical\nlaws, for there to be a hurricane. One might say that we need more than\nthe language of physics to describe and explain the weather,\nbut we do not need more than its ontology. There is token\nidentity between each individual hurricane and a mass of atoms,\neven if there is no type identity between hurricanes as kinds\nand some particular structure of atoms as a kind. Genuine property\ndualism occurs when, even at the individual level, the ontology of\nphysics is not sufficient to constitute what is there. The irreducible\nlanguage is not just another way of describing what there is, it\nrequires that there be something more there than was allowed for in the\ninitial ontology. Until the early part of the twentieth century, it was\ncommon to think that biological phenomena (\u2018life\u2019) required\nproperty dualism (an irreducible \u2018vital force\u2019), but nowadays the\nspecial physical sciences other than psychology are generally thought\nto involve only predicate dualism. In the case of mind, property\ndualism is defended by those who argue that the qualitative nature of\nconsciousness is not merely another way of categorizing states of the\nbrain or of behaviour, but a genuinely emergent phenomenon.\n",
