    "main_text": "Life and Writings\n1. Life and Writings\n\nAlthough Robert Desgabets (1610\u20131678) is perhaps the most\noriginal of the Cartesian thinkers, even lauded by his most famous\nstudent, Pierre-Sylvain R\u00e9gis, as \u201cone of the greatest\nmetaphysicians of our century\u201d (Regis, 1704, 328), only one book\nand two small works were published anonymously during his\n lifetime.[2]\n His correspondence indicates that he was interested in mechanics\nbefore 1644, prior to his acquaintance with the writings of Descartes.\nFor a metaphysical thinker like Desgabets, it was Descartes, not\nGalileo or Bacon, who offered a new and complete philosophic system.\nIn Desgabets\u2019s estimation, the only legitimate rival system to\nDescartes\u2019s was the one developed by Pierre Gassendi, but in the\nfinal analysis, the \u201cnew scientific discoveries\u201d weighed\ndecisively in Descartes\u2019s favor.\n\nIn 1658 Desgabets participated in the Cartesian conferences held at M.\nde Montmort\u2019s where he reportedly participated in discussions\nwith Rohault, Clerselier, and Cordemoy. Desgabets delivered a lecture\nwhich outlined his invention of an apparatus and procedure for blood\ntransfusion, but he seems to have abandoned its study shortly\nthereafter. In 1667, after a controversy erupted between the English\nand the French over who first invented the procedure, a French\nphysician by the name of Jean Denis was spurred to publish the written\nversion of Desgabets\u2019s lecture. This appeared in 1668, four\nyears after the physicians Clark and Henshaw of England had attempted\nthe operation on animals without success (Desgabets, 1668). Prior to\nthis research, in 1656, Christopher Wren successfully injected\nmedications directly into the veins of animals, after which in 1665,\nanother Englishman and physician, Richard Lower, a teacher and friend\nof John Locke, successfully injected blood into animals using this\nsame method. Genevieve Rodis-Lewis has sorted out many of the details\nof this history and shows that the two procedures created by Lower and\nDesgabets are so different as to confirm the independence of their\ninventions (Rodis-Lewis, 1974). But whether and when Desgabets\nexperimented with his procedure has not been firmly established. What\nis evident, however, is that Desgabets, like Wren, was inspired by\nHarvey\u2019s discovery of the circulation of blood. Once Harvey had\nshown how the circulation of blood is best understood as a mechanistic\nprocess operating according to lawful movements, he opened the way for\nblood transfusion to be understood along similar lines, as a species\nof the communication of movement. Where evidence of Desgabets\u2019s\nactual experimentation with blood transfusion is lacking, his\ndescriptions of it show that he was aware of the possibility of shock\nif the quantities transferred were too great for the subject\n(Rodis-Lewis, 1974).\n\nThroughout his lifetime Desgabets engaged in many theological and\nphilosophical controversies with distinguished seventeenth-century\nthinkers such as Mabillon, Rapin, Foucher, Malebranche, Cordemoy,\nArnauld and Poisson. One of his more famous interlocutors was the\nCartesian G\u00e9rauld de Cordemoy (1626\u20131684). Despite his\nadmiration for Cordemoy, Desgabets was dismayed by the atomism in the\nDiscernement du corps et de l\u2019\u00e2me (1666), a copy\nof which had been sent to him by Clerselier. Desgabets subsequently\nwrote to Clerselier, opposing Cordemoy\u2019s arguments for the\nexistence of the void and against the infinite divisibility of\nextension. In an unpublished letter to Clerselier, Desgabets comments\nthat the marriage of Cartesian and anti-Cartesian elements in this\nwork formed an irreconcilable schism in the Cartesian philosophy.\n(Prost, 1907, 158) Although Desgabets himself was not one to adopt\nCartesianism in its entirety, in his view his criticisms perfected and\nmaintained the integrity of the Cartesian principles, while\nCordemoy\u2019s adoption of atoms and the void was a direct affront\nto the Cartesian\n metaphysics.[3]\n\nAnother, much more scandalous exchange took place between Desgabets\nand Thomas Le G\u00e9ant between 1671\u20131672 over\nDesgabets\u2019s thoughts on the Eucharist. Desgabets published his\nviews anonymously in Consid\u00e9rations sur l\u2019\u00e9tat\npr\u00e9sent de la controverse touchant le T. S. Sacrement de\nl\u2019autel (1671). Lemaire credited this work with having been\nthe primary cause of the persecution of Cartesianism in France, since\nit brought to light the incompatibility of the Cartesian philosophy\nwith the official Church doctrine on the mystery of the Eucharist\n(Lemaire, 1901, 124). Desgabets had entered the on-going debate\nregarding Christ\u2019s real presence in the host in 1654 at\nClerselier\u2019s request. Desgabets set out to defend the Cartesian\ndoctrine of material substance against the Peripatetic doctrine of\nsubstantial forms in his explication of real presence and\ntransubstantiation. Clerselier and Rohault had defended\nDescartes\u2019s ideas on the subject along similar lines, but no one\nhad been willing, either privately or publicly, to argue as Desgabets\neventually did, that the body of Christ is extended in the host. In\naddition, Desgabets\u2019s persistence and perhaps even imprudence,\npushed the issue into the open. For, it was shortly after the\npublication of the anonymous Consid\u00e9rations that\nDesgabets sent additional writings on the topic to Abbey Le Roi, who\ncommunicated them to Nicole and Arnauld. The latter found\nDesgabets\u2019s views dangerous and completely against tradition. It\nwas through his acquaintance with Nicole and Arnauld, that the\nnon-Cartesian Le G\u00e9ant learned of the document and the identity\nof its author. Le G\u00e9ant alerted the Procurer General of the\nCongregation of Benedictines, who ordered Desgabets to report to his\nsuperiors concerning the matter. This led to an interrogation and the\nsubsequent issuance of an order on the 15th of December 1672, which\ndemanded that Desgabets renounce his views on the Eucharist\n(Armogathe, 1977, 104\u2013105; Lemaire, 1901, 51; 127\u2013128).\nDesgabets obeyed and retreated to a monastery at Breuil. Fortunately\nthis did not end his philosophical productivity. The controversy\nattracted the attention of Cardinal de Retz, who was known for his\nradical spirit of reform among conservative ecclesiastics in France.\nCardinal de Retz, who was a partisan of the new Cartesian philosophy,\nprovided protection for Desgabets and invited him to the Cartesian\nconferences held at Chateau de Commercy. It was here that Desgabets\ncriticized and corrected what he saw as the errors of Descartes, and\ncompleted his \u201cindefectibility thesis,\u201d which he had\nstarted in 1653\u20131654.\n\nDesgabets\u2019s last published work, Critique de la critique de\nla Recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 (1675), was intended as a\ndefense of Malebranche against the skeptic Simon Foucher. The\ncontroversy began with the publication of Malebranche\u2019s\nRecherche de la Verit\u00e9 (1674), followed by\nFoucher\u2019s critique, Critique de La Recherche de la\nVerit\u00e9 (1675), and Desgabets\u2019s rejoinder,\nCritique de la Critique de La Recherche de la Verit\u00e9\n(1675). Foucher presses Malebranche on a number of issues he\nsees as errors of dogmatism, centering on how ideas can be said to\nrepresent external objects to us. Foucher argues that ideas fail to\nrepresent if ideas share no likeness or similitude to their objects.\nDesgabets replies that ideas have an intentional or representational\nresemblance not a strict resemblance in the sense in which a painting\npictures its subject. Desgabets\u2019s response on behalf of\nMalebranche did not settle the controversy, nor was it appreciated by\nMalebranche himself. Malebranche wrote that although he was pleased\nwith the person, he was not pleased with the contents of his book; he\nfurther lamented that Desgabets ought to have better understood his\nideas before taking on a defense. Desgabets himself was never to see\nMalebranche\u2019s scolding assessment which was published in the\n\u201cAdvertissement\u201d of the third edition of the Search\nAfter Truth (Malebranche, 1958\u201384, v2, 500\u2013503).\nDesgabets died at Breuil on March 13, 1678, just fourteen days before\nit appeared.\n\nDesgabets\u2019s most important philosophical text,\nSuppl\u00e9ment \u00e0 la philosophie de M. Descartes\n(1675), was intended as a supplement to Descartes\u2019s\nMeditationes de prima philosophia (1641). In this\nwork, Desgabets examines many of Descartes\u2019s important doctrines\nand arguments. Desgabets defends the Cartesian doctrines of sensible\nqualities, matter as extended substance and mind as thinking\nsubstance, mind-body dualism, mind-body union and interaction in man,\nwhile criticizing Descartes\u2019s argument for the cogito\nas the first principle of knowledge, as well as Descartes\u2019s\narguments for pure intellection, innate ideas, and ideas having\nobjective reality (pure possibility). What is particularly interesting\nis the central importance that Desgabets gives to the role of\nsensation in knowledge, and his development of Descartes\u2019s\ntreatment of truth as both eternal and immutable but in some sense\n(one much contested in the literature) contingent. Desgabets more than\nonce remarks in this work that \u201cM. Descartes is not always a\ngood Cartesian,\u201d which typifies his conviction that Cartesianism\nis more than the sum of the particulars set down by Descartes\nhimself.\n\nViewing Desgabets\u2019s work as a whole, there is no doubt that what\nhe viewed as a revision or perfection of the Cartesian philosophy\nothers have viewed as a fundamental departure. In his favor, he never\nstrayed from the Cartesian metaphysics, i.e., its substance dualism of\nmind and matter, substance-mode ontology, mind-body union and\ninteraction, and the view that extension is the essence of matter and\nthought the essence of mind; and he remained loyal to the Cartesian\nphysics against the atomists. However, heretically to some, he\nstrongly rejected several key rationalist doctrines which often\ndominate in Descartes and argued that Descartes\u2019s own principles\nfavor a sensory foundation for knowledge.\n",
