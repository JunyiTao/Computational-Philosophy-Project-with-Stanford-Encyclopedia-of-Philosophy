It seems that we\nmust ascribe to God perfect rationality: God is a rational agent, and\nit seems obvious that if we hold that God is in any way suboptimal,\nrationally speaking, then that would count as a defect in God.\n\nTo be perfectly rational is to have one\u2019s agency shaped by the\nreasons that bear on one\u2019s agency in the way that those reasons\ndictate. It is not assumed by this characterization of perfect\nrationality that reasons are the only thing that shape one\u2019s\nagency; the only requirement here is that one\u2019s agency does not\nflout what the relevant reasons require. \n\nDo God\u2019s perfect rationality and God\u2019s perfect moral\ngoodness cohere? Can one be perfectly rational and perfectly morally\ngood? If the requirements of rationality can require an action that is\nruled out by the requirements of morality, or vice versa, then we have\na problem: the absolutely perfect being cannot be both perfectly\nrational and perfectly morally good. So anyone who wishes to defend\nperfect moral goodness as a feature of the absolutely perfect being\nmust hold that what moral goodness requires is at least compatible\nwith the requirements of rationality. \n\nThe compatibility of the requirements of rationality with the\nrequirements of moral goodness is a relatively weak constraint, one\nthat could be satisfied by holding merely that what rationality\nrequires is thin compared to what morality requires: perhaps\nrationality leaves a lot of open space within which agents are not\nrationally constrained to choose one way or the other, and one of the\nways that they might choose is the way required by morality. But one\nmight argue that this weak constraint is not enough, given that God is\nmorally good necessarily. For what is to explain why God\nnecessarily acts in accordance with the requirements of moral\ngoodness, if God is perfectly free? Perhaps a perfectly free being\nwill conform to the reasons that are relevant in the situation of\nchoice; but is it compatible with perfect freedom to hold that God\nmust act in a certain way, even though there are (ex\nhypothesi) entirely adequate reasons to act some other,\nincompatible way?\n\nThe tension being discussed here could be resolved if we were to\naccept a certain sort of internalist thesis about moral norms, a\nthesis that Michael Smith calls \u201crationalism\u201d (Smith 1994,\np. 62), though it would need to be affirmed in a somewhat stronger\nform than that which Smith affirms. The rationalist thesis as Smith\ndescribes it holds no more than that the fact that an act is morally\nright for an agent to perform entails that the agent has a good reason\nfor performing it. The strengthened rationalist thesis holds that the\nfact that an action is the morally best action for an agent to perform\nentails that it is the action that the agent has most reason to\nperform. What is being supposed here is that rationality, vis-a-vis\nmorality, is very demanding: moral requirements just are rational\nrequirements, so that a failure to act morally is a failure to act\nrationally.\n\nThis strengthened rationalist thesis is of course a controversial\nmetaethical view: some would deny that there must be any reason at all\nfor an agent to do what morality requires, much less that there is\ndecisive reason to do so. But it is one route to the reconciliation of\ndivine rationality and freedom with perfect moral goodness.\n\nThose who incline toward a compatibilist account of divine freedom\nmight think that there is less of a problem here. Why must we try to\npreserve divine freedom by holding that God\u2019s adherence to the\nnorms of morality is a matter of God taking the route most supported\nby reasons? Why not just say that the structure of divine character\n\u2013 God\u2019s virtues \u2013 is that of a morally perfect\nbeing? Since divine action proceeds from the divine nature itself, one\nmight say, it counts as free; and since that nature is morally\nperfect, the action that proceeds from it will be perfectly good as\nwell. We do not need to advert to any controversial metaethical\nthesis, then, to explain how divine freedom and rationality fit with\nperfect moral goodness.\n\nWhile this is an open strategy, there are some worries that can be\nraised with respect to it. The first is that it is unclear whether\ndivine freedom is really being adequately respected. One might wonder\nhow it could be that God\u2019s agency counts as free if God is\nunable to take seriously in choice options that God nevertheless\nrecognizes that there are adequate reasons to perform. But that is an\nimplication of the view as described: because rationality does not\nrule out immoral options, yet the structure of God\u2019s desires\nprecludes God from taking those options, God is unable to take\nseriously options that there are entirely sufficient reasons to carry\nout. This has an appearance of a lack of freedom, not the perfection\nof it.\n\nThe second is about how we should think about the perfection of moral\ngoodness on this view. One of the key issues within the methodology of\nperfect being theology is how the presence of certain items on the\nlist of perfections is to be justified. There are some uncontroversial\nways of ruling items off the list \u2013 if the perfection\npresupposes an imperfection, for example \u2013 but whether some\nfeature that passes these negative tests counts as an intrinsically\ngood-making feature is a more difficult question. If moral goodness is\na requirement of rationality, it seems much easier to make a case that\nmoral goodness is a divine perfection. For it seems undeniable that\nrationality counts as a perfection for God, as it must for any agent.\nAnd so if moral goodness is itself a matter of responding\nappropriately to reasons, as it is on the strong rationalist thesis\ndescribed above, then moral goodness must count as a perfection as\nwell. But if moral goodness is not a requirement of reason, is it so\nclear that moral goodness is a divine perfection? What considerations\nmight one forward for the view that moral goodness is a perfection, if\nGod has adequate reasons not to act in the morally best way?\n\nIn order to square perfect moral goodness with perfect rationality and\nperfect freedom, one must either (a) affirm a strong account of the\nreason-giving character of moral norms or (b) explain both why\nGod\u2019s freedom is not compromised by not being able to make a\nchoice fully supported by reasons and why moral goodness counts as a\ndivine perfection (Murphy 2017).\n",
