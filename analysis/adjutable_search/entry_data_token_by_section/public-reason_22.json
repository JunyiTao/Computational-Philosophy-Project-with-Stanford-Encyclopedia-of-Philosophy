Paul Weithman suggests that public reason also plays\nan essential role\u2014at least in Rawls\u2019s Political\nLiberalism\u2014in establishing mutual assurance with regard to\na commitment to a public conception of justice amongst citizens who\nare deeply divided about religious, moral, and philosophical matters\n(Weithman 2010, 326\u2013335). On this view, citizens need to be\nassured that others are committed to justice in order to know that\nacting from their own sense of justice is not something to regret.\nWithout this assurance, citizens might reasonably worry that acting\njustly conflicts too deeply with their narrow conception of the good,\nin which case society would not be stable and well-ordered in\nRawls\u2019s senses (see also Hadfield and Macedo 2012; Macedo 2010,\nOther Internet Resources).\n\nThe extent to which the idea of public reason does or can perform this\nsocial function depends on the answers to several further questions\n(Kogelman and Stich 2016; Lister 2017; Thrasher and Vallier 2015). For\nexample, the potential of public reason to function as a mechanism of\nmutual assurance depends on how we interpret the duties that public\nreason imposes on ordinary citizens. How can ordinary citizens provide\nsatisfactory assurance to one another that they are, in fact,\nsincerely committed to a conception of public reason? Is there an\nanswer to this latter question that also meets the criterion of\npublicity, that is one where the specific duties of public reason are\nsomething each person can know, and where the conformity of each with\nthose requirements can be common knowledge (for this construal of\npublicity, see Rawls 1999a, 48\u201349)? Some argue that while\nRawls\u2019s conception of public reason cannot serve as an effective\nassurance mechanism, convergence models of public reason can more\nsuccessfully perform this role (Kogelman and Stich 2016). Others have\nargued that a form of public justification is necessary to facilitate\nsufficient trust amongst citizens in a diverse society (Vallier\n2019).\n",
