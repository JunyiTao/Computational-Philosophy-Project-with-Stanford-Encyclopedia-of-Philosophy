    "main_text": "Ethics and Ethical Theory || Consequentialist Elements and Interpretations\n3.3 Consequentialist Elements and Interpretations\n\nSeveral scholars have advanced consequentialist interpretations of the\noverall moral view expressed in \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s works (see\nSiderits 2000; Clayton 2006: 112\u201318; Goodman 2008, 2009). One of\nthe best pieces of textual evidence in favor of such interpretations\noccurs at \u015aS 15, where \u015a\u0101ntideva writes in his\nown voice:\n\n\nOn this topic, for those who have taken the vow, a universal\ncharacteristic of downfalls will be stated, so that whenever they\nperceive anything that has that characteristic, they should abandon\nit, and so that they will not become confused by merely apparent\ndownfalls, or things that merely appear not to be downfalls.\n\nIf a bodhisattva does not make a sincere, unwavering effort in\nthought, word, and deed to stop all the present and future pain and\nsuffering of all sentient beings, and to bring about all present and\nfuture pleasure and happiness, or does not seek the collection of\nconditions for that, or does not strive to prevent what is opposed to\nthat, or does not bring about small pain and suffering as a way of\npreventing great pain and suffering, or does not abandon a small\nbenefit in order to accomplish a greater benefit, if he neglects to do\nthese things even for a moment, he undergoes a downfall. (see SS-G:\n17)\n\n\nThe intention of this passage is to present a general account of what\nconstitutes a \u201cdownfall\u201d (Sanskrit \u0101patti).\nThe term \u0101patti has as its primary meaning a violation\nor breach of some morally significant commitment that an agent has\nundertaken in the past. In this context, the commitment in question is\nthe bodhisattva vow, the aspiration to attain Awakening (Sanskrit\nbodhi) for the benefit of all sentient beings. So\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s goal in this passage is to give a general,\naction-guiding characterization of what it would mean to violate the\nbodhisattva vow.\n\nIn doing so, \u015a\u0101ntideva offers a formulation with several\nstriking similarities to a theory that has been hugely influential in\nthe history of Western ethical thought, a theory now normally called\n\u201cclassical utilitarianism\u201d. As articulated by a number of\nBritish writers in the nineteenth century, most notably Jeremy\nBentham, John Stuart Mill, and Henry Sidgwick, classical\nutilitarianism holds that the criterion of right action is based on\nthe consequences of our actions for the happiness of sentient beings.\nMill once formulated this view as holding\n\n\nthat actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote\nhappiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By\nhappiness is intended pleasure and the absence of pain; by\nunhappiness, pain and the privation of pleasure. (Mill 2001 [1861]:\n7)\n\n\nIn rationally evaluating different options on this basis, many\nutilitarians claim that we should aggregate all the different\nconsequences of each action, weighting possibilities by the\nprobability they will occur, and then maximize, choosing the action\nwith the highest expected value for all those affected, counting\neveryone equally. \n\nSimilarly, for \u015a\u0101ntideva, we can evaluate our actions as\nregards their compatibility with the bodhisattva vow by asking whether\nthey tend to relieve the suffering and promote the happiness of all\nsentient beings. Moreover, where there is a choice between bringing\nabout a greater good or a lesser one, \u015a\u0101ntideva holds that\nthe bodhisattva vow requires us to maximize, sacrificing the lesser\ngood to achieve the greater one. And \u015a\u0101ntideva explicitly\ncommits himself to what many contemporary authors find to be an\nobjectionable feature of utilitarianism: namely, its demands on the\nindividual agent. Bodhisattvas are to devote all their time and all\ntheir efforts to alleviating the suffering and promoting the happiness\nof the world; to neglect this imperative \u201ceven for a\nmoment\u201d is a moral failure for them.\n\nIf the quotation above from \u015aS 15 really is an\nexposition of utilitarianism, it may be the very earliest clearly\narticulated statement of that view, preceding Jeremy Bentham by\napproximately a thousand years. \u015a\u0101ntideva was not the first\nconsequentialist ethical theorist; that distinction may go to the\nChinese philosopher Mozi. Yet there is not a single passage in\nMozi\u2019s writings that comes nearly as close to a statement of a\nmature form of utilitarianism as \u015a\u0101ntideva does in\n\u015aS 15. This passage constitutes a remarkable, and\nlong-neglected, intellectual achievement.\n\nOne concern that might be raised about the passage at \u015aS\n15 is that it is not quite as explicit as we would like about how to\nmake tradeoffs between two distinct others. So if A has to\nchoose whether to harm B in order to save C from some\ngreater harm, how should A make this choice? Such a situation\nwould seem to be an instance of \u201cbring[ing] about small pain and\nsuffering as a way of preventing great pain and suffering\u201d; yet\nneither here nor anywhere else in his work does \u015a\u0101ntideva\nexplicitly describe a choice that has this exact form. What he does do\nis consider tradeoffs between the wellbeing of the agent A and\nof some other person B; and what he says about these tradeoffs\nhas an unambiguously consequentialist structure. This is especially\nclear in the case of the famous verse on the gift of the body,\nBCA V.87:\n\n\nTherefore one should not relinquish one\u2019s life for someone whose\ndisposition to compassion is not as pure. But for someone whose\ndisposition is comparable, one should relinquish it. That way, there\nis no overall loss. (C&S: 41\u201342; for discussion, see Ohnuma\n2000, especially pp. 60\u201361)\n\n\nHere \u015a\u0101ntideva, who repeatedly advocates extreme and\nfrightening forms of self-sacrifice in contexts where such actions\nwould make things better, teaches that such self-sacrifice is not\nrequired, and indeed, is not advisable, where it would fail to promote\nthe good. What is more, there is at least one context in which\n\u015a\u0101ntideva argues that the bodhisattva is allowed to harm\nother sentient beings in order to support her own spiritual practice.\nThis occurs in the discussion of meat-eating at \u015aS\n132\u2013135. After quoting a passage that argues at length against\nthe consumption of meat, \u015a\u0101ntideva cites and endorses the\nview of another source holding that \u201cif it leads to a great\nbenefit, there is no problem\u201d (SS-G: 130). This will be true\ndespite the harm done to the animal whose meat is eaten.\n\nNumerous other passages in the BCA and the \u015aS\ncan be, and have been, read as providing additional evidence for\nconsequentialism as a crucial commitment and, indeed, as a central\nmessage of these texts. Several of these concern the issue of when it\nis acceptable to infringe what would normally be binding rules of\nBuddhist moral discipline. Several important Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts\nthat preceded \u015a\u0101ntideva, such as the S\u016btra on\nSkillful Means (Tatz 1994) and Asa\u1e45ga\u2019s Chapter\non Moral Discipline (Tatz 1986), had explained that particular\nrules and precepts of moral discipline in the Mah\u0101y\u0101na were\nintended to be flexible, so that they could permissibly be broken\nunder certain special circumstances without generating any unfavorable\nkarmic consequences. \u015a\u0101ntideva appears to have reflected\ncarefully on these teachings, developed their implications and\nexplored their theoretical basis. His position on the flexibility of\nthe rules is stated in full generality at BCA V.84:\n\u201cEven what is proscribed is permitted for a compassionate person\nwho sees it will be of benefit\u201d (C&S: 41). In various\npassages scattered through the \u015aS, \u015a\u0101ntideva\nexplains how this general perspective works as regards a number of\nspecific kinds of normally impermissible actions, such as theft\n(\u015aS 133), sexual misconduct (\u015aS\n166\u201367), and giving people alcohol and weapons (\u015aS\n271). In each case, \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s view is that when an\naction that is usually harmful occurs under special circumstances that\nwill lead it to have good consequences, and when the agent has a\nsufficiently pure compassionate motivation to benefit others, it is\npermissible. Similar reasoning is found at \u015aS\n144\u201345, where \u015a\u0101ntideva examines the circumstances\nunder which not giving something away is the appropriate\nchoice for a bodhisattva; these are characterized in terms of the\nundesirable consequences that would result from the gift. \n\nAt \u015aS 145\u2013146, we find further evidence\nreinforcing the consequentialist interpretation of\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s ethics:\n\n\nAs the bodhisattva S\u0101rthav\u0101ha said in the S\u016btra on\nChanting the Dharma Together, \u201cBlessed One, when a\nbodhisattva longs for Awakening first of all for all sentient beings,\nnot for himself \u2026 this, Blessed One, is chanting the Dharma\ntogether.\u201d\n\nIt is only by giving things up that his own welfare is accomplished.\nNevertheless, for fear of losing benefits for sentient beings, he does\nnot place his own burden on unworthy sentient beings. But where no\nbenefits to sentient beings will be lost, what difference does it make\nif the welfare of the world is promoted by him or by somebody\nelse?\n\nSuppose that he fails to discard what is wholesome of his own in order\nto bring about what is wholesome for other bodhisattvas. Well, if he\nfears the suffering of the lower realms for himself, what others fear\nis also suffering. If he is indifferent, thinking \u201cThat\nsuffering has nothing to do with me\u201d, then as the s\u016btras\nsay, he undergoes a downfall. (SS-G: 141)\n\n\nAccording to this passage, bodhisattvas should focus their aspirations\non the Awakening of all sentient beings, and should even be prepared\nto sacrifice their own virtues (\u201cwhat is wholesome of his\nown\u201d) to enable other practitioners to advance along their own\npaths to spiritual maturity. The core argument for doing so, that\n\u201cwhat others fear is also suffering\u201d, recalls the\nreasoning of BCA VIII.96. \n\nProbably the most important aspect of this rich and complex passage is\nthe rhetorical question it raises: \u201cwhat difference does it make\nif the welfare of the world is promoted by him or by somebody\nelse?\u201d If we answer \u201cno difference\u201d, as\n\u015a\u0101ntideva seems to wish us to, then we may thereby be\ncommitted to a strong form of what philosophers call\n\u201cagent-neutrality\u201d. In Reasons and Persons,\nParfit explains this concept as follows. If a normative theory gives\ndifferent agents different moral aims, then it is an agent-relative\ntheory. So, for example, many moral theories hold that parents have a\nspecial obligation to take care of their own children; such views\nwould give each parent the aim that his or her own children flourish,\nand these aims would differ from one person to the next. A theory is\nagent-neutral in virtue of giving all agents the very same set of\nmoral aims. So a theory that told everyone to adopt the sole aim that\nall children should flourish would be an agent-neutral theory.\n\nNow a view that claims that it does not matter whether, say, Martha or\nVivek promotes the welfare of the world, but only how much the welfare\nof the world is promoted, is an agent-neutral view, in that it gives\nboth Martha and Vivek the same, common aim: that all sentient beings\nshould enjoy the best lives possible. In terms of such a view, Martha\nshould, for example, abandon an opportunity to produce a small benefit\nfor others if she can, thereby, create the conditions for Vivek to\nbring about a greater benefit for others. This kind of\nagent-neutrality is a central element of most consequentialist views,\nand plays a crucial role in generating many of their most frequently\ndiscussed implications. So \u015aS 145\u201346, and other\npassages in the texts that are suggestive of agent-neutrality, provide\nevidence in favor of reading \u015a\u0101ntideva as an early\nconsequentialist theorist. And even if we were to conclude that\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s normative perspective is not a form of\nconsequentialism, if we also conclude that it is fully agent-neutral,\nthat will be enough to guarantee that it has much in common with many\nWestern consequentialist theories.\n",
