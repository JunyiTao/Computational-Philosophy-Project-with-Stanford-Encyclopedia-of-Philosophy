    "main_text": "Decomposition Principles || Strong Supplementation and Extensionality\n3.2 Strong Supplementation and Extensionality\n\nWe may also ask the opposite question: Are there any stronger ways of\nexpressing the supplementation intuition besides (P.4)? In classical\nmereology, the standard answer is in the affirmative, the main\ncandidate being the following:\n\n\n(P.5)\nStrong Supplementation\n\n\u00acPyx \u2192 \u2203z(Pzy \u2227\n\u00acOzx). \n\n\nIntuitively, this says that if an object fails to include\nanother among its parts, then there must be a remainder, something\nthat makes up for the difference. It is easily seen that, given\nM, (P.5) implies (P.4), so any\nM-theory violating (P.4) will a fortiori\nviolate (P.5). For instance, on Whitehead's boundary-free theory of\nextensive connection, a closed region is not part of its interior even\nthough each part of the former overlaps the latter. More generally,\nthe entailment holds as long as parthood is antisymmetric (see again\nFigure 3, center, for a non-antisymmetric counterexample). However,\nthe converse is not true. The diagram in Figure 4 illustrates an\nM-model in which (P.4) is satisfied, since each\nproper part counts as a supplement of the other; yet (P.5) is\nfalse.\n\n\nFigure 4. A supplemented model violating Strong\nSupplementation.\n\n\nThe theory obtained by adding (P.5) to (P.1)\u2013(P.3) is thus a\nproper extension of MM. We label this stronger theory\nEM, for Extensional Mereology, the attribute\n\u2018extensional\u2019 being justified precisely by the exclusion\nof countermodels that, like the one in Figure 4, contain distinct\nobjects with the same proper parts. In fact, it is a theorem of\nEM that no composite objects with the same\nproper parts can be distinguished:\n\n\n(27)\n(\u2203zPPzx \u2228\n\u2203zPPzy) \u2192 (x=y \u2194\n\u2200z(PPzx \u2194 PPzy)). \n\n\n(The analogue for \u2018P\u2019 is already provable in\nM, since P is reflexive and antisymmetric.) This goes\nfar beyond the intuition that lies behind the basic Supplementation\nprinciple (P.4). Does it go too far?\n\nOn the face of it, it is not difficult to envisage scenarios that\nwould correspond to the diagram in Figure 4. For example, we may take\nx and y to be the sets {{z}, {z,\nw}} and {{w},{z, w}}, respectively\n(i.e., the ordered pairs \u27e8z, w\u27e9 and\n\u27e8w, z\u27e9), interpreting \u2018P\u2019\nas the ancestral of the improper membership relation (i.e., of the\nunion of \u2208 and =). But sets are abstract entities, and the\nancestral relation does not generally satisfy (P.4) (the singleton of\nthe empty set, for instance, or the singleton of any urelement, would\nhave only one proper part on the suggested construal of\n\u2018P\u2019). Can we also envisage similar scenarios in the domain\nof concrete, spatially extended entities, granting (P.4) in its\ngenerality? Admittedly, it is difficult to picture two\nconcrete objects mereologically structured as in Figure 4. It is\ndifficult, for example, to draw two extended objects composed of the\nsame proper parts because drawing something is drawing its\nproper parts; once the parts are drawn, there is nothing left to be\ndone to get a drawing of the whole. Yet this only proves that pictures\nare biased towards (P.5). Are there any philosophical reasons to\nresist the extensional force of (P.5) beyond the domain of abstract\nentities, and in the presence of (P.4)?\n\nTwo sorts of reason are worth examining. On the one hand, it is\nsometimes argued that sameness of proper parts is not\nsufficient for identity. For example, it is argued that: (i)\ntwo words can be made up of the same letters (Hempel 1953: 110;\nRescher 1955: 10), two tunes of the same notes (Rosen and Dorr 2002:\n154), and so on; or (ii) the same flowers can compose a nice bunch or\na scattered bundle, depending on the arrangements of the individual\nflowers (Eberle 1970: \u00a72.10); or (iii) two groups can have\nco-extensive memberships, say, the Library Committee and the\nPhilosophy Department football team (Simons 1987: 114; Gilbert 1989:\n273); or (iv) a cat must be distinguished from the corresponding\namount of feline tissue, for the former can survive the annihilation\nof certain parts (the tail, for instance) whereas the latter cannot by\ndefinition (Wiggins 1968; see also Doepke 1982, Lowe 1989, Johnston\n1992, Baker 1997, Meirav 2003, Sanford 2003, and Crane 2012, inter\nalia, for similar or related arguments). On the other hand, it is\nsometimes argued that sameness of parts is not necessary for\nidentity, as some entities may survive mereological change. If a cat\nsurvives the annihilation of its tail, then the tailed cat (before the\naccident) and the tailless cat (after the accident) are numerically\nthe same in spite of their having different proper parts (Wiggins\n1980). If any of these arguments is accepted, then clearly (27) is too\nstrong a principle to be imposed on the parthood relation. And since\n(27) follows from (P.5), it might be concluded that\nEM is on the wrong track.\n\nLet us look at these objections separately. Concerning the necessity\naspect of mereological extensionality, i.e., the left-to-right\nconditional in the consequent of (27),\n\n\n(28)\n x=y \u2192 \u2200z(PPzx\n\u2194 PPzy),  \n\n\nit is perhaps enough to remark that the difficulty is not peculiar to\nextensional mereology. The objection proceeds from the consideration\nthat ordinary entities such as cats and other living organisms (and\npossibly other entities as well, such as statues and ships) survive\nall sorts of gradual mereological change. This a legitimate thought,\nlest one be forced into some form of \u201cmereological\nessentialism\u201d (Chisholm 1973, 1975, 1976; Plantinga 1975;\nWiggins 1979). However, the same can be said of other types of change\nas well: bananas ripen, houses deteriorate, people sleep at night and\neat at lunch. How can we say that they are the same things, if they\nare not quite the same? Indeed, (28) is essentially an instance of the\nidentity axiom schema\n\n\n(ID)\nx=y \u2192 (\u03c6x \u2194\n\u03c6y),  \n\n\nand it is well known that this axiom schema runs into trouble when\n\u2018=\u2019 is given a diachronic reading. (See the entries on\n change\n and\n identity over time.)\n The problem is a general one. Whatever the solution, it will\ntherefore apply to the case at issue as well, and in this sense the\nabove-mentioned objection to (28) can be disregarded. For example, the\nproblem would dissolve immediately if the variables in (28) were taken\nto range over four-dimensional entities whose parts may extend in time\nas well as in space (Heller 1984, Lewis 1986b, Sider 2001), or if\nidentity itself were construed as a contingent relation that may hold\nat some times or worlds but not at others (Gibbard 1975, Myro 1985,\nGallois 1998). Alternatively, on a more traditional, three-dimensional\nconception of material objects, the problem of change is often\naccounted for by relativizing properties and relations to times,\nrewriting (ID) as\n\n\n(ID\u2032)\n x=y \u2192\n\u2200t(\u03c6tx \u2194\n\u03c6ty).  \n\n\n(This may be understood in various ways; see e.g. the papers in\nHaslanger and Kurtz 2006, Part III.) If so, then again the specific\nworry about (28) would dissolve, as the relativized version of (P.5)\nwould only warrant the following variant of the conditional in\nquestion:\n\n\n(28\u2032)\n x=y \u2192\n\u2200t\u2200z(PPtzx \u2194\nPPtzy).  \n\n\n(See Thomson 1983, Simons 1987: \u00a75.2, Masolo 2009, Giaretta and\nSpolaore 2011; see also Kazmi 1990 and Hovda 2013 for tensed versions\nof this strategy.) The need to relativize parthood to time, and\nperhaps to other parameters such as space, possible worlds, etc., has\nrecently been motivated also on independent grounds, from the\nso-called \u201cproblem of the many\u201d (Hudson 2001) to material\nconstitution (Bittner and Donnelly 2007), modal realism (McDaniel\n2004), vagueness (Donnelly 2009), relativistic spacetime (Balashov\n2008), or the general theory of location (Gilmore 2009, Donnelly\n2010). One way or the other, then, such revisions may be regarded as\nan indicator of the limited ontological neutrality of extensional\nmereology. But their independent motivation also bears witness to the\nfact that controversies about (28) stem from genuine and fundamental\nphilosophical conundrums and cannot be assessed by appealing to our\nintuitions about the meaning of \u2018part\u2019.\n\nThe worry about the sufficiency aspect of mereological extensionality,\ni.e., the right-to-left conditional in the consequent of (27),\n\n\n(29)\n \u2200z(PPzx \u2194 PPzy) \u2192\nx=y,  \n\n\nis more to the point. However, here too there are various ways of\nresponding on behalf of EM. Consider counterexample\n(i)\u2014say, two words made up of the same letters, as in\n\u2018else\u2019 and \u2018seel\u2019. If these are taken as\nword-types, a lot depends on how exactly one construes such things\nmereologically, and one might simply dismiss the challenge by\nrejecting, or improving on, the dime-store thought that word-types are\nletter-type composites (see above ad (14)). Indeed, if they\nwere, then word-types would not only violate extensionality, hence the\nStrong Supplementation principle (P.5); they would violate the basic\nSupplementation principle (P.4), since \u2018seel\u2019 (for\ninstance) would contain a proper part (the string \u2018ee\u2019)\nthat consists of a single proper part (the letter \u2018e\u2019). On\nthe other hand, if the items in question are taken as word-tokens,\nthen presumably they are made up of distinct letter-tokens, so again\nthere is no violation of (29), hence no reason to reject (P.5) on\nthese grounds. Of course, we may suppose that one of the two\nword-tokens is obtained from the other by rearranging the same\nletter-tokens. If so, however, the issue becomes once again one of\ndiachronic non-identity, with all that it entails, and it is not\nobvious that we have a counterexample to (29). (See Lewis 1991: 78f.)\nWhat if our letter-tokens are suitably arranged so as to form both\nwords at the same time? For example, suppose they are arranged in a\ncircle (Simons 1987: 114). In this case one might be inclined to say\nthat we have a genuine counterexample. But one may equally well insist\nthat we have got just one circular inscription that, curiously, can be\nread as two different words depending on where we start. Compare: I\ndraw a rabbit that to you looks like a duck. Have I thereby made two\ndrawings? I write \u2018p\u2019 on my office glass door; from the\noutside you read \u2018q\u2019. Have I therefore produced two\nletter-tokens? And what if Mary joins you and reads it upside down;\nhave I also written the letter \u2018b\u2019? Surely then I have\nalso written the letter \u2018d\u2019, as my upside-down office mate\nJohn points out. This multiplication of entities seems preposterous.\nThere is just one thing there, one inscription, and what it looks (or\nmean) to you or me or Mary or John is irrelevant to what that thing\nis. Similarly\u2014it may be argued\u2014there is just one\ninscription in our example, a circular display of four letter-tokens,\nand whether we read it as an \u2018else\u2019-inscription or a\n\u2018seel\u2019-inscription is irrelevant to its mereological\nstructure. (Varzi 2008)\n\nCase (ii)\u2014the flowers\u2014is not significantly different. The\nsame, concrete flowers cannot compose a nice bunch and a scattered\nbundle at the same time. Similarly for many other cases of\nthis sort that may come to mind, including much less frivolous\nprima facie counterexamples offered by the natural\nsciences\u2014from the different phases of matter (solids, liquids,\nand gases) to the different possibilities of chemical binding; see\ne.g. Harr\u00e9 and Llored (2011, 2013) and Sukumar (2013). (Not all\ncases are so easily dismissed, though. In particular, several\nauthors\u2014from Maudlin 1998 to Krause 2011\u2014have argued that\nthe world of quantum mechanics provides genuine type-(ii)\ncounterexamples to extensionality. A full treatment of such arguments\ngoes beyond the scope of this entry, but see e.g. Calosi et\nal. 2011 and Calosi and Tarozzi 2014 for counter-arguments.)\n\nCase (iii) is more delicate, as it depends on one's metaphysics of\nsuch things as committees, teams, and groups generally. If one denies\nthat the relevant structural relation is a genuine case of parthood\n(see Section 1, ad (11)), then of course the counterexample\nmisfires. If, on the other hand, one takes groups to be bona\nfide mereological composites\u2014and composites consisting of\nenduring persons as opposed to, say, person-stages, as in Copp\n(1984)\u2014then a lot depends on one's reasons to treat groups with\nco-extensive memberships as in fact distinct. Typically such reasons\nare just taken for granted, as if the distinctness were obvious. But\nsometimes informal arguments are offered to the effect that, say, the\ncoextensive Library Committee and football team must be distinguished\ninsofar as they have different persistence conditions, or different\nproperties broadly understood. For instance, the players of the team\ncan change even though the Committee remains the same, or one group\ncan be dismantled even though the other continues to operate, or one\ngroup has different legal obligations than the other, and so on (see\ne.g. Moltmann 1997). If so, then case (iii) becomes relevantly similar\nto case (iv). There, too, the intuition is that a living animal such\nas a cat is something \u201cover and above\u201d the mere lump of\nfeline tissue that constitutes its body\u2014that they have different\nsurvival conditions and, hence, different properties\u2014so it\nappears that here we have a genuine counterexample to mereological\nextensionality (via Leibniz's Law). It is for similar reasons that\nsome philosophers are inclined to treat a vase and the corresponding\nlump of clay as distinct in spite of their sharing the same proper\nparts\u2014possibly even the same improper parts, contrary to (P.3),\nas seen in Section\n 2.2.[14]\n Two responses may nonetheless be offered in such cases on behalf of\nEM (besides rejecting the intuition in question on\nthe basis of a specific metaphysics of persistence).\n\nFocusing on (iv), the first response is to insist that, on the face of\nit, a cat and the corresponding lump of feline tissue (or a statue and\nthe lump of clay that constitutes it) do not share the same proper\nparts after all. For, on the one hand, if one believes that at least\none such thing, x, is part of the other, y, then it\nmust be a proper part; and insofar as nothing can be a proper part of\nitself, it follows immediately that such things do not in fact\nconstitute a counterexample to (29). (This would also follow from\nSupplementation, as emphasized e.g. in Olson 2006, since the\nassumption that x and y have the same proper parts\nentails that no part of y is disjoint from x, at\nleast so long as parthood is reflexive; but there is no need to invoke\n(P.4) here.) On the other hand, if one believes that neither\nx nor y is part of the other, then presumably the\nsame belief will also apply to some of their proper parts\u2014say,\nthe cat's tail and the corresponding lump of tissue. And if the tail\nis not part of that lump, then presumably it is also not part\nof the larger lump of tissue that constitutes the whole cat (as\nexplicitly acknowledged by some anti-extensionalists, e.g. Lowe 2001:\n148 and Fine 2003: 198, n. 5, though see Hershenov 2008 for\nmisgivings). Thus, again, it would appear that x and\ny do not have the same proper parts after all and do not,\ntherefore, constitute a counterexample to (29). (For more on this line\nof argument, see Varzi 2008.)\n\nThe second and more general response on behalf of EM\nis that the appeal to Leibniz's law in this context is illegitimate.\nLet \u2018Tibbles\u2019 name our cat and \u2018Tail\u2019 its\ntail, and grant the truth of\n\n\n(30)\nTibbles can survive the annihilation of Tail. \n\n\nThere is, indeed, an intuitive sense in which the following is also\ntrue:\n\n\n(31)\nThe lump of feline tissue constituting Tail and the rest of\nTibbles's body cannot survive the annihilation of Tail. \n\n\nHowever, this intuitive sense corresponds to a de dicto\nreading of the modality, where the definite description in (31) has\nnarrow scope:\n\n\n(31a)\nIn every possible world, the lump of feline tissue constituting\nTail and the rest of Tibbles's body ceases to exist if Tail is\nannihilated. \n\n\nOn this reading, (31) is hardly negotiable. Yet this is irrelevant in\nthe present context, for (31a) does not amount to an ascription of a\nmodal property and cannot be used in connection with Leibniz's law.\n(Compare: 8 is necessarily even; the number of planets might have been\nodd; hence the number of planets is not 8.) On the other hand,\nconsider a de re reading of (31), where the definite\ndescription has wide scope:\n\n\n(31b)\nThe lump of feline tissue constituting Tail and the rest of\nTibbles's body is such that, in every possible world, it ceases to\nexist if Tail is annihilated. \n\n\nOn this reading, the appeal to Leibniz's law would be legitimate\n(modulo any concerns about the status of modal properties) and one\ncould rely on the truth of (30) and (31) (i.e., (31b)) to conclude\nthat Tibbles is distinct from the relevant lump of feline tissue.\nHowever, there is no obvious reason why (31) should be regarded as\ntrue on this reading. That is, there is no obvious reason to suppose\nthat the lump of feline tissue that in the actual world constitutes\nTail and the rest of Tibbles's body\u2014that lump of feline\ntissue that is now resting on the carpet\u2014cannot survive the\nannihilation of Tail. Indeed, it would appear that any reason in favor\nof this claim vis-\u00e0-vis the truth of (30) would have\nto presuppose the distinctness of the entities in question,\nso no appeal to Leibniz's law would be legitimate to\ndetermine the distinctess (on pain of circularity). This is\nnot to say that the putative counterexample to (29) is wrong-headed.\nBut it requires genuine metaphysical work to establish it and it makes\nthe rejection of extensionality, and with it the rejection of the\nStrong Supplementation principle (P.5), a matter of genuine\nphilosophical controversy. (Similar remarks would apply to any\nargument intended to reject extensionality on the basis of competing\nmodal intuitions regarding the possibility of mereological\nrearrangement, rather than mereological change, as\nwith the flowers example. On a de re reading, the claim that\na bunch of flowers could not survive rearrangement of the\nparts\u2014while the aggregate of the individual flowers composing it\ncould\u2014must be backed up by a genuine metaphysical theory about\nthose entities. For more on this general line of defense on behalf of\n(29), see e.g. Lewis 1971: 204ff, Jubien 1993: 118ff, and Varzi 2000:\n291ff. See also King's 2006 reply to Fine 2003 for a more general\ndiagnosis of the semantic mechanisms at issue here.)\n",
