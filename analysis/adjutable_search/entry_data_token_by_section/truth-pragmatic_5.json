    "main_text": "Truth as a Norm of Inquiry and Assertion\n3. Truth as a Norm of Inquiry and Assertion\n\nMore recently\u2014since roughly the turn of the twenty-first\ncentury\u2014pragmatic theories of truth have focused on\ntruth\u2019s role as a norm of assertion or inquiry. These theories\nare sometimes referred to as \u201cnew pragmatic\u201d theories to\ndistinguish them from both classical and neo-pragmatic accounts (Misak\n2007b; Legg and Hookway 2021). Like neo-pragmatic accounts, these\ntheories often build on, or react to, positions besides the\ncorrespondence theory: for example, deflationary, minimal, and\npluralistic theories of truth. Unlike some of the neo-pragmatic\naccounts discussed above, these theories give relativism a wide berth,\navoid defining truth in terms of concepts such as warranted\nassertibility, and treat correspondence theories of truth with deep\nsuspicion.\n\nOn these accounts truth plays a unique and necessary role in\nassertoric discourse (Price 1998, 2003, 2011; Misak 2000, 2007a,\n2015): without the concept of truth there would be no difference\nbetween making assertions and, to use Frank Ramsey\u2019s nice\nphrase, \u201ccomparing notes\u201d (1925 [1990: 247]). Instead,\ntruth provides the \u201cconvenient friction\u201d that \u201cmakes\nour individual opinions engage with one another\u201d (Price 2003:\n169) and \u201cis internally related to inquiry, reasons, and\nevidence\u201d (Misak 2000: 73).\n\nLike all pragmatic theories of truth, these \u201cnew\u201d\npragmatic accounts focus on the use and function of truth. However,\nwhile classical pragmatists were responding primarily to the\ncorrespondence theory of truth, new pragmatic theories also respond to\ncontemporary disquotational, deflationary, and minimal theories of\ntruth (Misak 1998, 2007a). As a result, new pragmatic accounts aim to\nshow that there is more to truth than its disquotational and\ngeneralizing function (for a dissenting view see Freedman 2006).\nSpecifically, this \u201cmore\u201d is that the concept of truth\nalso functions as a norm that places clear expectations on speakers\nand their assertions. In asserting something to be true, speakers take\non an obligation to specify the consequences of their assertion, to\nconsider how their assertions can be verified, and to offer reasons in\nsupport of their claims:\n\n\nonce we see that truth and assertion are intimately\nconnected\u2014once we see that to assert that p is true is\nto assert p\u2014we can and must look to our practices of\nassertion and to the commitments incurred in them so as to say\nsomething more substantial about truth. (Misak 2007a: 70)\n\n\nThis would mean that truth is not just a goal of inquiry, as Dewey\nclaimed, but actually a norm of inquiry that sets expectations for how\ninquirers conduct themselves.\n\nMore specifically, without the norm of truth assertoric discourse\nwould be degraded nearly beyond recognition. Without the norm of\ntruth, speakers could be held accountable only for either insincerely\nasserting things they don\u2019t themselves believe (thus violating\nthe norm of \u201csubjective assertibility\u201d) or for asserting\nthings they don\u2019t have enough evidence for (thus violating the\nnorm of \u201cpersonal warranted assertibility\u201d) (Price 2003:\n173\u2013174). The norm of truth is a condition for genuine\ndisagreement between people who speak sincerely and with, from their\nown perspective, good enough reasons. It provides the\n\u201cfriction\u201d we need to treat disagreements as genuinely\nneeding resolution: otherwise, \u201cdifferences of opinion would\nsimply slide past one another\u201d (Price 2003: 180\u2013181). In\nsum, the concept of truth plays an essential role in making assertoric\ndiscourse possible, ensuring that assertions come with obligations and\nthat conflicting assertions get attention. Without truth, it is no\nlonger clear to what degree assertions would still be assertions, as\nopposed to impromptu speculations or musings. (Correspondence theories\nshould find little reason to object: they too can recognize that truth\nfunctions as a norm. Of course, correspondence theorists will want to\nadd that truth also requires correspondence to reality, a step\n\u201cnew\u201d pragmatists will resist taking.)\n\nIt is important that this account of truth is not a definition or\ntheory of truth, at least in the narrow sense of specifying necessary\nand sufficient conditions for a proposition being true. (That is,\nthere is no proposal along the lines of \u201cS is true\niff\u2026\u201d; though see Brown (2015: 69) for a Deweyan\ndefinition of truth and Heney (2015) for a Peircean response.) As\nopposed to some versions of neo-pragmatism, which viewed truth as\n\u201cindefinable\u201d in part because of its supposed simplicity\nand transparency, this approach avoids definitions because the concept\nof truth is implicated in a complex range of assertoric practices.\nInstead, this approach offers something closer to a \u201cpragmatic\nelucidation\u201d of truth that gives \u201can account of the role\nthe concept plays in practical endeavors\u201d (Misak 2007a: 68; see\nalso Wiggins 2002: 317).\n\nThe proposal to treat truth as a norm of inquiry and assertion can be\ntraced back to both classical and neo-pragmatist accounts. In one\nrespect, this account can be viewed as adding on to neo-pragmatic\ntheories that reduce truth to justification or \u201cpersonal\nwarranted assertibility\u201d. In this respect, these newer pragmatic\naccounts are a response to the problems facing neo-pragmatism. In\nanother respect, new pragmatic accounts can be seen as a return to the\ninsights of classical pragmatists updated for a contemporary audience.\nFor example, while Peirce wrote of beliefs being \u201cfated\u201d\nto be agreed upon at the \u201cideal limit\u201d of\ninquiry\u2014conditions that to critics sounded metaphysical and\nunverifiable\u2014a better approach is to treat true beliefs as those\n\u201cthat would withstand doubt, were we to inquire as far as we\nfruitfully could on the matter\u201d (Misak 2000: 49). On this\naccount, to say that a belief is true is shorthand for saying that it\n\u201cgets thing right\u201d and \u201cstands up and would continue\nto stand up to reasons and evidence\u201d (Misak 2015: 263, 265).\nThis pragmatic elucidation of the concept of truth thus attempts to\ncapture both what speakers say and what they do when they describe a\nclaim as true. In a narrow sense the meaning of truth\u2014what\nspeakers are saying when they use this word\u2014is that true beliefs\nare indefeasible. However, in a broader sense the meaning of truth is\nalso what speakers are doing when they use this word, with the\nproposal here that truth functions as a norm that is constitutive of\nassertoric discourse.\n\nAs we have seen, pragmatic accounts of truth focus on the function the\nconcept plays: specifically, the practical difference made by having\nand using the concept of truth. Early pragmatic accounts tended to\nanalyze this function in terms of the practical implications of\nlabeling a belief as true: depending on the version, to say that a\nbelief is true is to signal one\u2019s confidence, or that the belief\nis widely accepted, or that it has been scientifically verified, or\nthat it would be assertible under ideal circumstances, among other\npossible implications. These earlier accounts focus on the function of\ntruth in conversational contexts or in the context of ongoing\ninquiries. The newer pragmatic theories discussed in this section take\na broader approach to truth\u2019s function, addressing its role not\njust in conversations and inquiries but in making certain kinds of\nconversations and inquiries possible in the first place. By viewing\ntruth as a norm of assertion and inquiry, these more recent pragmatic\ntheories make the function of truth independent of what individual\nspeakers might imply in specific contexts. Truth is not just what is\nassertible or verifiable (under either ideal or non-ideal\ncircumstances), but sets objective expectations for making assertions\nand engaging in inquiry. Unlike neo-pragmatists such as Rorty and\nPutnam, new pragmatists such as Misak and Price argue that truth plays\na role entirely distinct from justification or warranted\nassertibility. This means that, without the concept of truth and the\nnorm it represents, assertoric discourse (and inquiry in general)\nwould dwindle into mere \u201ccomparing notes\u201d.\n",
