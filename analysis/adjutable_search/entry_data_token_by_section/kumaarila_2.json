    "main_text": "Life, works, and influence || The works of Kum\u0101rila as commentaries on foundational texts\n1.3 The works of Kum\u0101rila as commentaries on foundational texts\n\n\nTypifying the \u201cs\u016btra\u201d genre of mnemonic concision,\nJaimini\u2019s aphorisms are often intelligible only with reference to\ncommentaries; the earliest of the completely extant commentaries on\nJaimini\u2019s s\u016btras is that of \u015aabara (fl. c. 400 c.e.),\nwhose commentary (which itself quotes from at least one\nno-longer-extant earlier commentary) defines the basic parameters of\nthe tradition\u2019s unfolding. The divergent elaborations of the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka project represented by Kum\u0101rila and\nPrabh\u0101kara are therefore framed, in turn, as commenting on\n\u015aabara\u2019s interpretation of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nS\u016btras. It is typical, then, for passages from\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s corpus to be cited with reference to the section\nof \u015aabara\u2019s commentary from which they depart\u2014which\neffectively means that Kum\u0101rila\u2019s topics can usually be\nreferred to by the particular s\u016btras of Jaimini upon which\n\u015aabara was himself commenting. So, for example,\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s elaboration of the svata\u1e25\npr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya (\u201cimmediate justification\u201d)\ndoctrine in epistemology is framed in terms of \u015aabara\u2019s\ncommentary on Jaimini\u2019s \u201ccodan\u0101\ns\u016btra\u201d\u2014the s\u016btra, that is, that specifies\nthat Vedic \u201cinjunction\u201d (codan\u0101) is the only\nvalid way of knowing dharma. References, then, to the passages\nin which Kum\u0101rila develops his signal epistemological contribution\nare typically to the numbered verses of the \u201ccodan\u0101\ns\u016btra\u201d chapter of his\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika.\n\n\nThe latter title names one of four works attributed to Kum\u0101rila,\nand one of the two most important; it is the\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika that is typically taken to be of\ngreatest philosophical significance, and it was surely this work that\nwas most recurrently engaged by other Indian philosophers. The\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika is framed by \u015aabara\u2019s\ncommentary on the beginning of the first chapter of Jaimini\u2019s\nwork\u2014the part of \u015aabara\u2019s commentary traditionally\nstyled \u201cTarkap\u0101da,\u201d or the \u201cpart\nconcerning reasoning,\u201d wherein \u015aabara considers as a\npreliminary matter questions pertaining to whether Vedic texts\nought in the first place to be thought an epistemically reliable basis\nfor action. It is thus in the \u015alokav\u0101rttika\nthat Kum\u0101rila argues for the epistemological and metaphysical\ncommitments relevant to the governing claim that the Vedas are uniquely\nauthoritative for matters of ultimate concern. Typically of the\n\u201cv\u0101rttika\u201d genre of commentary,\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s \u201ccommentary\u201d often significantly\nrevises or elaborates on the thoughts advanced in \u015aabara\u2019s\ntext, and the novelty of some of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s arguments is\ntherefore often clear. Typically, as well, of the inter-traditionally\ncontested period in which he wrote, the epistemological and other\narguments of the \u015alokav\u0101rttika generally involve\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s heavily engaging rival Indian schools of thought\nand showing their alternative positions to fail as defeaters. While the\narguments are in the service of claims (such as that the Vedas are\neternal) that are unlikely to be attractive to modern readers, this\ntext is often a model of philosophical subtlety and sophistication.\n\n\nThe philosophically rich \u015alokav\u0101rttika can be\nunderstood, however, as a prolegomenon to the real, hermeneutical\nbusiness of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, which is most significantly\nadvanced in Kum\u0101rila\u2019s Tantrav\u0101rttika. Framed\nas a commentary on the remainder of \u015aabara\u2019s chapter 1\nthrough his chapter 3, this massive work addresses questions raised by\nthe different kinds of sentences to be found in the Vedas, the status\nof Brahmanical literature that is not part of the Vedic corpus, and all\nmanner of grammatical and metaphysical issues pertaining to the\nperformance of Vedic ritual as that is enjoined by sometimes\ninterpretively obscure Vedic texts. In this under-studied text, then,\nthere is much to be learned about Kum\u0101rila\u2019s highly ramified\nphilosophy of language, as well as about the ideological and practical\nparticulars of the ritualistic Vedic worldview. In addition to the\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika and the Tantrav\u0101rttika,\nKum\u0101rila authored the Tup\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101, which\ncomments on the remaining balance of \u015aabara\u2019s commentary;\nand the no-longer-extant B\u1e5bhat\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101,\nwhose extensive treatment of many of the concerns of the\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika is recoverable from the large parts of\nit that are preserved in the Buddhist\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s Tattvasa\u1e43graha (see\nFrauwallner 1962).\n",
