There\nare more in depth treatments of the matter, to which an interested\nreader should turn (Bedau & Cleland 2010, Riskin 2015, Mix 2018).\nApproaches to this issue vary widely across historians, philosophers,\nand scientists, so some skepticism about any individual author\u2019s\napproach to the topic is warranted.\nWe begin with the Greeks. In several dialogues, notably the\nPhaedrus, Timeaus, and Republic, Plato\ndivided life into three parts: vegetable life, animal life, and\nrational life. All living creatures possessed the first in the form of\nnutrition and reproduction, animals were additionally capable of\nsensation and locomotion, and humans also had rational souls.\nPlato\u2019s subsequent influence in Christian theology may be\napparent in spirit if not in detail. In Christian theology, human life\nwas not only rational, but also involved an eternal, spiritual soul and\nan internal, conscious life.\nPlato\u2019s student, Aristotle, had a different notion in which\nliving things had an appropriate form, material, and goal-directedness\n(De Anima, 412a1\u2013416b). Aristotle held life to be a\nform of self-motion, perpetuation, or self-alteration (Byers 2006). For\nAristotle, the capacity to resist internal and external perturbations\nwas the essential distinction between living beings and non-living\nobjects. Other features were accidental. This quest for demarcating the\nessential from the accidental for life has persisted to this day in\nsearches for theoretical definitions of life as well as in attacks\nagainst those not interested in such definitions.\nCenturies later, Descartes drew a sharper distinction between animal\nlife and rational life than between inanimate objects and animal life.\nThis was a turn away from medieval approaches, which had taken the gap\nbetween vegetables and animals to be broader. For Descartes, animals\nare analogous to complex clocks and lack the inner or spiritual life\ncentral to the human experience (Descartes 2010/1664). As such,\nDescartes\u2019 category of life neither mapped onto Greek conceptions\nnor current conceptual frameworks. The mechanistic view developed by\nDescartes and his followers is often thought to be continuous with\ncurrent scientific thinking, but this is perhaps anachronistic, as much\nof the theoretical underpinning separating animal life and rational\nlife is no longer accepted.\n The responses to Descartes came to be grouped under the\nheading \u2018vitalism.\u2019 Vitalism, which spanned three\ncenturies, was a heterogenous philosophical position unified by\nadherents\u2019 doubt of a fully mechanistic view of life. Vitalists\nhad ontologies of defining features of life as varied as immaterial\ncauses, particular arrangements of matter, a special life fluid, a\nparticular end goal, or even mental forces. A whiggish history of\nbiology will declare the death of vitalism with Friedrich\nW\u00f6hler\u2019s synthesis of urea from ammonium cyanate. The\nsuggestion is that if biological chemicals can be produced from mere\nchemistry, then biology is also mere chemistry. Although this was an\nimportant step, many chemists already had accepted a mechanistic world\nview, and many other researchers continued to develop vitalist theories\nwell into the 20th century (Bergson 1959, Driesch 1905/1914).\n",
