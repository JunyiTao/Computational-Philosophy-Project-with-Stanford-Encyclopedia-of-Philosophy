    "main_text": "The functional question: Why does consciousness exist? || Freedom of will\n6.6 Freedom of will\n\nIncreased freedom of choice or free will. The issue of free\nwill remains a perennial philosophical problem, not only with regard to\nwhether or not it exists but even as to what it might or should consist\nin (Dennett 1984, van Inwagen 1983, Hasker 1999, Wegner 2002). (See\nthe entry on\n free will.)\n The notion of free will may itself remain too murky and contentious\nto shed any clear light on the role of consciousness, but there is a\ntraditional intuition that the two are deeply linked.\n\n\nConsciousness has been thought to open a realm of possibilities, a\nsphere of options within which the conscious self might choose or act\nfreely. At a minimum, consciousness might seem a necessary precondition\nfor any such freedom or self-determination (Hasker 1999). How could one\nengage in the requisite sort of free choice, while remaining solely\nwithin the unconscious domain? How can one determine one's own will\nwithout being conscious of it and of the options one has to shape\nit.\n\n\nThe freedom to chose one's actions and the ability to determine\none's own nature and future development may admit of many interesting\nvariations and degrees rather than being a simple all or nothing matter,\nand various forms or levels of consciousness might be correlated with\ncorresponding degrees or types of freedom and self-determination\n(Dennett 1984, 2003). The link with freedom seems strongest for the\nmeta-mental form of consciousness given its emphasis on self-awareness,\nbut potential connections also seem possible for most of the other\nsorts as well.\n",
