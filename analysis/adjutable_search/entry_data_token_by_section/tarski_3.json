    "main_text": "Logical constants\n4. Logical constants\n\nTarski did not think that the construction of section 3 completely\nsolved the problem of offering \u201ca materially adequate definition\nof the concept of consequence\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 418). According\nto Tarski, perhaps the most important difficulty that remained toward\nsolving that problem is created by the fact that \u201cunderlying our\nwhole construction is the division of all terms of the language\ndiscussed into logical and extra-logical\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p.\n418). This situation is tolerable because, as Tarski says in a letter\nof 1944, \u201cit is clear that for all languages which are familiar\nto us such definitions [of \u2018logical term\u2019 and\n\u2018logical truth\u2019] can be given (or rather: have been\ngiven); moreover, they prove fruitful, and this is really the most\nimportant. We can define \u2018logical terms\u2019, e.g., by\nenumeration\u201d (Tarski 1987, p. 29). But since the division is not\nbased on a previous characterization of logical terms generally\napplicable to arbitrary languages, to that extent the definition of\nlogical consequence is not fully general, and hence unsatisfactory. In\nthe final paragraph of the consequence paper Tarski says that a\npositive solution to the problem would \u201cenable us to justify the\ntraditional boundary between logical and extra-logical\nexpressions\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 420). In fact, this is the\nboundary which for Tarski is \u201cunderlying our whole\ndiscussion\u201d.\n\nTarski says that the distinction between logical and extra-logical\nterms is not entirely arbitrary, because if we were to include signs\nlike the implication sign or the universal quantifier among the\nextra-logical terms, \u201cour definition of the concept of\nconsequence would lead to results which obviously contradict ordinary\nusage\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 418). This is so because in this case\nthe definition would not declare logical consequences many instances\nof the relation consecrated by the common usage of logicians. However,\nTarski does not seem to worry that the opposite problem may arise. The\npossibility exists, according to him, of extending the set of logical\nterms without making the definition of logical consequence useless.\nEven if all terms of the language are considered logical, the\ndefinition results in a characterization of a special concept of\nconsequence, that of material consequence.\n\nWhen he speaks of extending liberally the set of logical terms, Tarski\nis perhaps thinking of the phenomenon of what he calls the\n\u201cdisciplines preceding a given discipline\u201d in Tarski\n(1937) (see p. 80). He speaks of logic as preceding every discipline,\nin the sense that logical constants and logical laws are presupposed\nby and form part of every science. But similarly, in developing a\ncertain theory, not only logic but other theories may be taken for\ngranted; thus Tarski speaks of logic and arithmetic as a conveniently\npresupposed basis of theories for the development of geometry. This\nwould account naturally for the fact that Tarski was skeptical about\nthe possibility of finding a sharp distinction between logical and\nextra-logical terms, for it might very well depend on the context of\ninvestigation what terms and what laws are considered as forming part\nof the \u201clogic\u201d of the investigation. \n\nAn example which we know Tarski had in mind is the sign for the\nmembership relation. We find him saying: \u201csometimes it seems to\nme convenient to include mathematical terms, like the \u2208-relation,\nin the class of logical ones, and sometimes I prefer to restrict\nmyself to terms of \u2018elementary logic\u2019. Is any problem\ninvolved here?\u201d (Tarski 1987, p. 29). We may take the sign for\nmembership as a logical sign in some formalizations of the theory of\ntypes (which can in turn be used to formalize theories with arbitrary\nuniverses of individuals). But when doing set theory for its own sake,\nthe appropriate thing is not to take membership as a logical notion,\nand not to assume principles about membership as forming part of the\n\u201clogic\u201d of the theory, but as postulates thereof.\nTarski\u2019s final remarks in the paper on logical consequence again\nput forward the view that the notion of logical constant may be of a\nrelative character. In different contexts different terms may be taken\nas logical and therefore so may vary the extension of the relation of\nlogical consequence. He says that \u201cthe fluctuation in the common\nusage of the concept of consequence would\u2014in part at\nleast\u2014be quite naturally reflected in such a compulsory\nsituation\u201d of relativity (Tarski 1983c, p. 420).\n\nBut this does not mean that no desiderata could or should be imposed\non a definition of the concept of a logical constant. Many years after\nwriting his paper on logical consequence, Tarski returned to the\nproblem of the definition of the concept of a logical term, advancing\nan attempt at a positive solution. Tarski thought that this solution\naccommodated his conviction that the notion of a logical term is not\nan absolute, but a relative one.\n\nThe basis for the proposed solution appears in Tarski\u2019s 1966\nlecture \u201cWhat are Logical Notions?\u201d (published\nposthumously as Tarski 1986a). Here Tarski first makes some remarks\nabout the general nature of his proposal. He says that an answer to a\nquestion like the one that gives title to the lecture may take several\nforms. It may give an account of the prevailing usage of the term\n\u201clogical notion\u201d, or of the prevailing usage of the term\namong people who are qualified to use it. It may be a normative\nproposal, a suggestion that the term be used in a certain way,\nindependently of its actual use. As a third possibility, some other\nanswers \n\nseem to aim at something very different (\u2026); people speak of\ncatching the proper, true meaning of a notion, something independent\nof actual usage, and independent of any normative proposals, something\nlike the platonic idea behind the notion. This last approach is so\nforeign and strange to me that I shall simply ignore it for I cannot\nsay anything intelligent on such matters (Tarski 1986a, p. 145).\n\n\nImmediately Tarski makes it clear that he is also not concerned with\ndeveloping a normative proposal, but an account which captures a\ncertain common use of the concept of logical notion: \u201cin\nanswering the question \u2018What are logical notions?\u2019 what I\nshall do is make a suggestion or proposal about a possible use of the\nterm \u2018logical notion\u2019. This suggestion seems to me to be\nin agreement, if not with a prevailing usage of the term\n\u2018logical notion\u2019, at least with one usage which actually\nis encountered in practice\u201d (Tarski 1986a, p. 145). \n\nWhat are notions? Tarski says:\n\nI use the term \u201cnotion\u201d in a rather loose and general\nsense, to mean, roughly speaking, objects of all possible types in\nsome hierarchy of types like that in Principia mathematica.\nThus notions include individuals (\u2026), classes of individuals,\nrelations of individuals, classes of classes of individuals, and so on\n(Tarski 1986a, p. 147).\n\n\nHe then proposes to define logical notions as those notions invariant\nunder all one-one transformations of the universe of discourse onto\nitself:\n\nconsider the class of all one-one transformations of the\nspace, or universe of discourse, or \u201cworld\u201d, onto itself.\nWhat will be the science which deals with the notions invariant under\nthis widest class of transformations? Here we will have very few\nnotions, all of a very general character. I suggest that they are the\nlogical notions, that we call a notion \u201clogical\u201d if it is\ninvariant under all possible one-one transformations of the world onto\nitself (Tarski 1986a, p. 149).\n\n\nA one-one transformation of a class onto itself, also called a\npermutation, induces permutations of all the types in the hierarchy of\ntypes of \u201cnotions\u201d determined by the class. Thus, a\npermutation P of a domain of individuals D induces a\npermutation of the class of n-ary relations of elements of\nD, a permutation of the class of functions with n arguments\nwith domain Dn and range included in\nD, a permutation of the class of n-ary relations\namong relations of elements of D, etc. A notion or object\nO of a certain type t is invariant under all\npermutations of the universe of discourse if, for every permutation\nP of this universe, the permutation P\u0303 induced\nby P in the class of notions of type t is such that\nP\u0303(O)=O.\n\nThere is no straightforward way in which the truth-functions and the\nquantifiers (over any type of objects) are identifiable with notions\nin the sense of Tarski. According to John Corcoran (see footnote 6 in\nTarski 1986a, p. 150), in one version of the lecture Tarski indicated\nthat the truth-functions and classical quantifiers can be constructed\nas certain objects in the type hierarchy that are invariant under all\npermutations, and, in this sense, are logical notions. (Clearly,\nTarski took the logicality of these notions almost for granted, and\nwas concerned with a definition which gave some account of the status\nof other more substantive notions in various mathematical languages.)\nFor example, the truth-values \u201ctrue\u201d and\n\u201cfalse\u201d can be identified with the universe of individuals\nand the null set, respectively, and the truth-functions in turn with\nfunctions having (tuples of) these classes as arguments and values;\nand the classical universal and existential quantifiers over a type of\nobjects t can be identified with certain functions from the\nclass of sets of objects of type t into the class of\ntruth-values\u2014identifying \u201ctrue\u201d with the universal\nset of objects of type t and \u201cfalse\u201d with the\nempty set of that type. (A universal quantifier will assign\n\u201ctrue\u201d to the set of all objects of type t, and\n\u201cfalse\u201d to all other subsets of t; and the\nexistential quantifier will assign \u201ctrue\u201d to the non-empty\nsubsets, and \u201cfalse\u201d to the empty subset.)\n\nIn 1966 Tarski does not propose a definition of the concept of logical\nconstant. One such definition, based on the 1966 idea, appears in a\nbook Tarski wrote in collaboration with Steven Givant, published in\n1987, four years after Tarski\u2019s death. The main concern of\nTarski and Givant (1987) is to indicate how to develop set theory in\nseveral different languages and to compare their expressive power.\nThey define the concept of logical constant for constants in the\nvocabulary of a certain class of languages\u2014all of which are in a\ncertain sense extensions of a basic language in which they are\nparticularly interested, weaker than the languages in which set theory\nis usually developed in means of expression, and yet sufficiently\npowerful for many purposes. The vocabulary of the basic language is\ncomposed of three two-place predicate constants of the second type and\nfour two-place function constants of the third type; the vocabulary of\nthe extensions considered by Tarski and Givant can only include\nconstants of those two kinds. (However, as we will see, there does not\nseem to be any problem in extending the range of applicability of\ntheir definition to wider classes of languages.) They then prove\nseveral results about that class of languages, results that involve\nthe defined concept of logical constant.\n\nTarski and Givant introduce informally the concept of a derivative\nuniverse of a given basic universe U. A derivative universe\nU\u0303 of a given basic universe U is what we have\nbeen calling the class of all objects of a certain type, generated\nfrom that basic universe U. Thus, the class of n-ary\nrelations of elements of U (for any given n), the\nclass of n-ary relations among relations of elements of\nU, etc., are derivative universes of U. After\nintroducing in the same way as above the concepts of a permutation of\nthe universe and of invariance of a member of a derivative universe\nunder every permutation of the basic universe, Tarski and Givant give\nthe following definitions:\n\n\n\nGiven a basic universe U, a member M of any\nderivative universe U\u0303 is said to be logical, or a\nlogical object, if it is invariant under every permutation P\nof U.\n\n(Strictly speaking, since an object M can be a member of many\nderivative universes, we should use in (i) the phrase \u201cis said\nto be logical, or a logical object, as a member of\nU\u0303\u201d.) \nA symbol S of [a language in the class considered by\nTarski and Givant] is said to be logical, or a logical constant, if,\nfor every given realization U of this [language] with\nthe universe U, S denotes a logical object in some\nderivative universe U\u0303 (Tarski and Givant 1987, p.\n57).\n\n\n(i) and the parenthetical comment that comes after it embody fairly\naccurately the basic idea behind the (relativized) definition of a\nlogical notion offered in Tarski (1986a), and (ii) offers the\n(absolute) definition of the concept of logical constant. There is no\napparent obstacle to applying (ii) to wider classes of languages than\nthe class considered for special purposes of their investigation by\nTarski and Givant. It seems safe to assume that the definition can be\napplied to a large class of languages in the classical hierarchy of\nquantificational languages. Tarski and Givant themselves say that the\nusual logical constants of languages not in the class considered by\nthem, like the symbols for the truth-functional connectives and\nquantifiers, \u201ccan also be subsumed under logical constants in\nthe sense of (ii)\u201d (Tarski and Givant 1987, p. 57), presumably\nthrough some artifice in the style of the one discussed above. (As we\nwill soon see, at the very least Tarski clearly would want his\ndefinition to be applicable to some languages whose set of sentences\nis that of some formulations of the simple theory of types.)\n\nIn Tarski and Lindenbaum (1935) the authors had proved that given a\nbasic universe U, all the notions in derivative universes of\nU which can be defined in the language of the simple theory\nof types are invariant under all permutations of U. In\ngeneral the Tarski-Lindenbaum theorem guarantees that all mathematical\nnotions definable in the logicist fashion in the simple theory of\ntypes are logical notions no matter what the universe of individuals\nis taken to be (Tarski says that \u201cwe may interpret [the universe\nof the intended interpretation of the language of the theory of types]\nas the universe of physical objects, although there is nothing in\nPrincipia mathematica which compels us to accept such an\ninterpretation\u201d (Tarski 1986a, p. 152)). Since the theorem\napplies to every universe U supplying an interpretation of\nthe language of the theory of types, the definition of the concept of\nlogical constant in Tarski and Givant (1987) implies that all\nprimitive symbols denoting notions in that language (e.g. quantifiers\nof all orders) are Tarskian logical constants; also, if the definition\nwere applicable to defined symbols, all these symbols would be\nTarskian logical constants. Such results agree well with a\n\u201cusage actually encountered in practice\u201d (for example, the\npractice of the logicists, but of others as well) according to which\nthe constants of the language of the theory of types are logical\nconstants.\n\nWhen the Tarski-Givant definition is applied to interpreted languages\nof mathematical theories with undefined mathematical primitives, it\nwill generally yield the result that the notions denoted by these\nprimitives are not Tarskian logical constants. Tarski\u2019s example\nis set theory formalized in first-order with a single primitive\npredicate for membership as a relation among elements of the universe\n(see Tarski 1986a, p. 153). Obviously membership as a relation over a\ndomain of individuals and sets is not invariant under all permutations\nof that domain, so it is not declared a logical notion of the language\nof set theory by Tarski\u2019s proposed definition. Similarly, the\nclass of all sets will be declared non-logical provided the class of\nindividuals that are not sets is not empty. A predicate whose intended\nmeaning is membership (among elements of the universe) is not a\nTarskian logical constant, simply because there is a universe in which\nit denotes a non-logical object (with respect to that universe);\nsimilarly, a predicate \u201cS\u201d whose intended meaning\nis \u201cis a set\u201d (such as is used in some formalizations of\nset theory suitable for contemplating individuals other than sets in\nthe universe) is not a Tarskian logical constant, for there is a\nuniverse in which \u201cS\u201d denotes a non-logical\nobject (in such a universe, the class of objects that are not sets\nmust be non-empty). These results are again in agreement with actual\nusage, for example in the model theory of first-order set theory,\nwhere the membership predicate is taken as a non-logical constant.\n\nFrom the consideration of the examples provided by the theory of types\nand first-order set theory, Tarski extracts a conclusion that he\nwelcomed. This is the conclusion that, in a certain sense, the\ndistinction between logical and non-logical constants is relative to a\ncontext of investigation. Recall Tarski\u2019s remarks about the sign\nfor membership in a letter of 1944. In the 1966 lecture Tarski says\nthat membership is a logical notion in some formalizations of the\ntheory of types. He says:\n\nUsing this method [of Principia Mathematica], it is clear\nthat the membership relation is certainly a logical notion. It occurs\nin several types, for individuals are elements of classes of\nindividuals, classes of individuals are elements of classes of classes\nof individuals, and so on. And by the very definition of an induced\ntransformation it is invariant under every transformation of the world\nonto itself (Tarski 1986a, pp. 152\u20133).\n\n\nIt is a bit unclear that the \u201cnotions\u201d of membership that\nTarski talks about are notions in the sense introduced by him earlier\nin the lecture. They do not \u201coccur\u201d in any type, given the\nstandard formulations of the theory of types (even in formulations in\nwhich a sign for membership is used), for they are relations among\nobjects of different types, which do not occur in a non-cumulative\nhierarchy. But Tarski is perhaps thinking of some non-standard,\ncumulative type hierarchy. Under a suitable expansion of the concept\nof a notion, the notions of membership Tarski has in mind will indeed\nbe invariant under permutations of any universe, and hence logical;\nand the sign or signs for these notions of membership will be Tarskian\nlogical constants. On the other hand, as pointed out above, membership\nas a relation over the domain of individuals and sets will not be a\nlogical notion in that domain, and hence the sign for this concept of\nmembership will not be a Tarskian logical constant. Thus,\ninterestingly, Tarski\u2019s definition of the concept of logical\nconstant respects in a sense his early relativistic view in the paper\non logical consequence. Tarski describes the situation in the\nfollowing passage:\n\nSince it is now well known that the whole of mathematics can be\nconstructed within set theory, or the theory of classes, the problem\n[of whether mathematical notions are logical notions] reduces to the\nfollowing one: Are set-theoretical notions logical notions or not?\nAgain, since it is known that all usual set-theoretical notions can be\ndefined in terms of one, the notion of belonging, or the membership\nrelation, the final form of our question is whether the membership\nrelation is a logical one in the sense of my suggestion. The answer\nwill seem disappointing. For we can develop set theory, the theory of\nthe membership relation, in such a way that the answer to this\nquestion is affirmative, or we can proceed in such a way that the\nanswer is negative (Tarski 1986a, pp. 151\u20132).\n\n",
