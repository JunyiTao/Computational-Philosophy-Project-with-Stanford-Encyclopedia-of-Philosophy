    "main_text": "The Linguistic Argument || The Details of the Intellectualist Proposal\n4.1 The Details of the Intellectualist Proposal\n\nThe linguistic argument concludes that Intellectualism is true:\n\n\nIntellectualism about knowing how S knows how\nto \u03a6 just in case S knows a proposition answering the\nquestion \u201chow to \u03a6\u201d.\n\n\nBut what is the proposition that one knows by knowing how to \u03a6?\n\n\nFirst, note that the subject of the infinitival construction\n(\u201cHow to \u03a6\u201d), or PRO, can either be interpreted de\nse (de se PRO) or generically (generic PRO). According\nto the first interpretation, that an agent knows how to perform a ski\nstunt requires their knowing how to perform a ski stunt\nthemselves. According to the latter interpretation, it\nrequires knowing how one (as a generic agent or any other\nagent) would perform a ski stunt. When it comes to ascriptions of\nknowledge-how, we care about de se, and not generic, readings\nof knowing how. If an agent knows how to \u03a6 in the relevant sense,\nthey know how to \u03a6 themselves. \n\nSecondly, infinitival interrogatives such as \u201chow to\n\u03a6\u201d and \u201cwhat to \u03a6\u201d are ambiguous between a\ndeontic reading (how to \u03a6 = how one should\n\u03a6; what to \u03a6 = what one should do) and an\nability reading (how to \u03a6 = how one could \u03a6;\nwhat to \u03a6 = what one could do). The deontic\nreading does not seem relevant when we ascribe knowledge-how. Hence\nthe relevant reading must be an ability reading. Joining these two\ndisambiguations, the truth conditions of knowledge-how ascriptions are\n(cf. Schroeder 2012):\n\n\n(Truth conditions) \u201cS knows how to\n\u03a6\u201d is true just in case S knows a proposition\nanswering the question \u201cHow could they themselves\n\u03a6?\u201d\n\n\nNow, what counts as an answer to the question? Linguists distinguish\nbetween different kinds of answers that one might give to a question.\nAn exhaustive answer to \u201cHow could S\n\u03a6?\u201d would specify all the ways in which S could\n\u03a6; a mention-some answer, instead, would specify only one\nway in which S could \u03a6. For example, an exhaustive answer\nto the question \u201cHow could S make pasta?\u201d would\nspecify all different recipes for making pasta. A mention-some answer\nto the same question, instead, would specify (at least) only one\nrecipe. When we ascribe knowledge-how, we don\u2019t expect people to\nknow all the possible ways of performing the relevant task. For\nexample, \u201cMary knows how to make pasta\u201d can be true, even\nif Mary only knows one recipe for pasta. This gives us the following\ntruth conditions:\n\n\nIntellectualism* \u201cS knows how to\n\u03a6\u201d is true just in case S knows, for some way w\nof \u03a6-ing, that w is a way he himself could\n\u03a6.\n\n\nAs we have seen in\n section 2,\n in addition to knowing that a way to \u03a6 is a way to \u03a6, one\nneeds to think of that way under a practical mode of presentation. Let\nPr be a practical way of thinking of a way and let way\nof \u03a6-ing be a way of thinking of the property of\nbeing a way of \u03a6-ing; finally let \u29bc be a way of composing\nways of thinking into a proposition. Then <Pr \u29bc way\nof \u03a6-ing> is the practical proposition that one\ncomes to know when coming to know how to \u03a6. On how to implement\nFregean senses in the compositional semantics, see Yalcin (2015).\n",
