    "main_text": "Value Creation\n3. Value Creation\n\nUnfortunately, neither Nietzsche\u2019s ideas about the nature of\nvalue creation nor his suggestions about what specific values should\nbe \u201ccreated\u201d have seemed as clear to readers as his\nnegative critique of traditional values. (The disparity is often\nmarked in the literature by doubts about whether Nietzsche has a\n\u201cpositive\u201d ethics to offer.) There is something to this\nreaction: Nietzsche\u2019s critique has a clear target and is\ndeveloped at an extended scale, whereas his suggestions about\nalternative values can seem scattered or telegraphic. That said, it is\nnot as though Nietzsche is the least bit shy about making evaluatively\nloaded claims, including \u201cpositive\u201d ones. To some extent,\ndisappointment among commentators in search of \u201cpositive\nviews\u201d arises from our looking for the wrong things\u2014for\nexample, seeking a systematically organized axiological theory when\nNietzsche himself is skeptical of any such project, or expecting any\n\u201cpositive\u201d ethics to accommodate certain \u201cmoral\nintuitions\u201d which Nietzsche is more inclined to challenge than\nto save. This section surveys some territory Nietzsche covers under\nthe heading \u201cvalue creation\u201d. After mentioning different\noptions for understanding the nature of such \u201ccreation\u201d,\nit explores some of the values he promotes.\n",
