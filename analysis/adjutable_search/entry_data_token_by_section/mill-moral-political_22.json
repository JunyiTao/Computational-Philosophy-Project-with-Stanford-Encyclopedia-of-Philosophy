    "main_text": "Liberal Democracy\n4. Liberal Democracy\n\nWe get a somewhat different perspective on Mill\u2019s utilitarian\nand liberal principles by seeing how he applies them to social and\npolitical issues. We might begin by focusing on Mill\u2019s defense\nof a democratic form of liberalism in Considerations on\nRepresentative Government and Principles of Political\nEconomy.\n\nIn Considerations on Representative Government Mill argues\nthat a form of representative democracy is the best ideal form of\ngovernment. It is not an invariant ideal that holds regardless of\nhistorical or social circumstances. But he does think that it is the\nbest form of government for societies with sufficient resources,\nsecurity, and culture of self-reliance. In particular, Mill thinks\nthat representative democracy is best, when it is best, because it\nbest satisfies two criteria of all good government: (1) that\ngovernment is good insofar as it promotes the common good, where this\nis conceived of as promoting the moral, intellectual, and active\ntraits of its citizens, and (2) that government is good insofar as it\nmakes effective use of institutions and the resources of its citizens\nto promote the common good (CRG 390, 392). Insofar as (2) is\nreally a component of (1), Mill\u2019s ultimate criterion is that\ngood government should promote the common good of its citizens. Mill\ndoes not explicitly invoke his version of utilitarianism. Perhaps he\nwants his defense of representative democracy to rest on more\necumenical premises. But he clearly understands this political\ncriterion of the common good in broadly consequentialist or\nresult-oriented terms. Moreover, though he may not mention the higher\npleasures doctrine explicitly, it is also clear that Mill understands\nthe good of each in broadly perfectionist terms that emphasize the\nimportance of an active and autonomous form of life that exercises\nintellectual, deliberative, and creative capacities.\n",
