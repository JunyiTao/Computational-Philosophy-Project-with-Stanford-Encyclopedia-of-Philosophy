    "main_text": "Grounds of Moral Status || Capacity to Develop Sophisticated Cognitive Capacities\n5.2 Capacity to Develop Sophisticated Cognitive Capacities\n\nThe problem, at least from the standpoint of the commonsense view, of\n5.1\u2019s underinclusion of infants can be avoided while still\nretaining a shared source of FMS. The accounts can be modified as\nfollows: sophisticated cognitive capacities or the capacity\nto develop these sophisticated capacities (without losing one\u2019s\nidentity) are necessary and sufficient for FMS. This is usually\nlabeled the \u201cpotential\u201d account in the literature (e.g.,\nStone 1987), although some authors do not use this terminology, but\nrather speak, for example, of the wrongness of killing due to the loss\nof a \u201cfuture like ours\u201d (Marquis 1989 and 1995). One can\nalso treat potentiality as a ground for some, but not full, moral\nstatus (Harman 1999, notwithstanding the revisions in Harman 2003) or\nas only an enhancer of moral status (Steinbock 1992, p. 68). Views\ndiffer in their interpretation of potentiality. For example, some deny\nthat a fetus that will die while still a fetus (of any cause) has the\nrelevant potential (Harman 1999, p. 311).\n\nThese potentiality accounts, like the accounts in 5.1, avoid\nanthropocentrism without according most animals the same elevation in\nmoral status. But, unlike the accounts in 5.1, they also include very\nunderdeveloped human beings: not only infants and one-year-olds, but\neven early fetuses have the capacity to develop sophisticated\ncognitive capacities (barring unusual cases). (Of course, these\naccounts are of no help to those interested in according moral status\nto non-human animals, trees, species, and ecosystems.)\n\nAlthough Boonin (2003) denies that his view is a potentiality account\n(p. 62), his view does implicitly appeal to potentiality, albeit with\nsomewhat different implications than those above. He defends having\nthe conjunction of \u201ca future-like-ours\u201d (a kind of\npotentiality) and \u201cactual conscious desires that can be\nsatisfied only if [one\u2019s] personal future is preserved\u201d as\nsufficient for FMS (p. 84). Barring early death, most two-year-olds\nand older children meet both conditions: they have a future like ours\nwhile also having conscious desires (e.g., for avocado tomorrow),\nwhich can only be satisfied if the child lives until the next day.\nEarly fetuses also typically have a future like ours, but they lack\nmental states such as desires, and thus are excluded from FMS. Boonin\nis explicitly neutral on the question whether animals have a\nfuture-like-ours, so his proposal is compatible with several different\nviews about the moral status of animals (p. 84, note 36).\n\nAny attempt to ground moral status in potentiality introduces its own\nchallenges. One could argue that mere potential cognitive capacity is\ninsufficient for FMS or even a weaker moral status. A potential US\npresident has neither rights nor even a claim to command the military;\nlikewise in the case of potentially cognitively sophisticated beings\nand the rights associated with moral status (Feinberg 1980, p.193).\nWhile this particular analogy has been contested (Wilkins 1993, pp.\n126\u2013127 and Boonin 2003, pp. 46\u201349), one can appeal to\nother analogies: a small child (a potential adult) doesn\u2019t have\nthe rights of adults to own property or to watch any television\nprogram it wants (Boonin 2003, p. 48).\n\nStill, there is room to press back on some aspects of this objection.\nWe do, after all, often treat people with potential differently from\nthose without it. We provide extra music instruction, music\nscholarships, and create music camps for those with the potential to\nbecome great musicians, whereas we do not do so for those lacking such\npotentiality. While being a potential adult human does not give one a\nright to vote, perhaps it gives us reason to act as trustees with\nregard to childrens\u2019 future status and interests and thus to\neducate and prepare them to become voters by the time they are adults;\nit does seem that children would be wronged if we neglected to so\nprepare them. In this way, we treat children differently from dogs who\nlack the potential to become adult humans, even though neither is now\nan adult human. And perhaps this difference in treatment would extend\neven to not taking certain actions (e.g., killing) that would result\nin the loss of the relevant potentiality. But this line of response\nmight only go so far when it comes to fetuses. With respect to a\nfuture-like-ours, some argue that the loss of this potentiality is\nmorally problematic only if the being is sufficiently psychologically\nconnected to that future person, and a fetus arguably lacks this\nsufficient connection (McInerney 1990).\n\nEven though the potentiality accounts come closer to capturing the\ncommonsense view than the Sophisticated Cognitive Capacities accounts,\nthey still are, from that point of view, underinclusive. Many\nconscious human beings whose cognitive impairment is both severe and\npermanent cannot meet these accounts\u2019 conditions for an elevated\nmoral status. It might be that humans who currently suffer from\nsevere, permanent cognitive impairment, but once had sophisticated\ncognitive capacities, have FMS in virtue of the past possession of\nthese capacities. But it is unclear how to defend such a claim.\nMoreover, the moral status of permanently severely cognitively\nimpaired humans who never had sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities remains unaccounted for (see the entry on\n cognitive disability and moral status).\n Even the versions of the accounts that offer only sufficient\nconditions for FMS still leave their moral status open and possibly on\na par with animals who similarly lack both the sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities and the capacity to develop them. In Boonin\u2019s case,\nsince he is agnostic about animals and so, presumably, about\ncognitively impaired human beings with similar prospects, his view\nwill either overinclude the former or underinclude the latter, as both\ntypes of beings will be treated on a par.\n",
