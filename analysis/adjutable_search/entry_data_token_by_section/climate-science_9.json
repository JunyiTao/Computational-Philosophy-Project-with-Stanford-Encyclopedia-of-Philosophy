    "main_text": "Climate Modeling || Uses of Climate Models\n4.3 Uses of Climate Models\n\nClimate models are used for many types of purpose; just a few will be\nmentioned here (see also Petersen 2012: Ch.5). One important use is in\ncharacterizing features of the climate system that are\ndifficult to learn about via available observations. For example, the\ninternal variability of the climate system is often estimated from the\nvariability seen in long GCM/ESM simulations in which external\nconditions are held constant at pre-industrial levels (Bindoff et al.\n2013). Internal variability is difficult to estimate from the\ninstrumental record, because the record is relatively short and\nreflects the influence not just of natural internal processes but also\nof changing external conditions, such as rising greenhouse gas\nconcentrations. Estimates of internal variability in turn play an\nimportant role in studies that seek to detect climate change in\nobservations (see\n Section 5.1).\n\nClimate models are also used as scientists seek explanations\nand understanding. Typically, explanations sought in climate\nscience are causal; climate scientists seek accurate accounts of how\ncombinations of climate system processes, conditions and features\ntogether bring about climate phenomena of interest, including climate\nchange. Parker (2014b) identifies several ways in which climate models\nhave facilitated such explanation: by serving as a surrogate for\nobservations, the analysis of which can suggest explanatory hypotheses\nand help to fill in gaps in how-possibly/plausibly explanations; by\nallowing scientists to test hypotheses relevant to explanation, e.g.,\nthat a set of causal factors represented in the model is sufficient to\nproduce a phenomenon (see also Lorenz 1970); and by serving as\nexperimental systems that can be manipulated and studied in order to\ngain insight into their workings, which can inform thinking about how\nthe climate system itself works. In connection with the latter, Held\n(2005) calls for increased efforts to develop and systematically study\n\u201chierarchies of lasting value\u201d\u2014sets of models,\nranging from the highly idealized to the very complex, that are\nconstructed such that they stand in known relations to one another so\nthat the sources of differences in their behavior can be more readily\ndiagnosed; he contends that the study of such hierarchies is essential\nto the development of climate theory in the twenty-first century.\n\nIn addition, climate models are used to make predictions. It\nmight be thought that, due to chaos, climate prediction is impossible.\nBut chaos is an obstacle to precisely predicting the trajectory of a\nsystem\u2014the time-ordered sequence of its states over a\nperiod\u2014not (necessarily) for predicting the statistical\nproperties of one or more trajectories; climate prediction is\nconcerned with the latter. Short-term predictions of climate for\nperiods ranging from a year to a decade or so are made with both\nphysics-based and empirical models (e.g., Meehl et al. 2014; Krueger\n& von Storch 2011). For these predictions, assumptions are made\nabout what external conditions actually will be like over the forecast\nperiod, and the forecasts begin from an observationally-based estimate\nof the recent state of the climate system. Better known, however, is\nthe use of climate models to make longer-term conditional predictions,\nknown as projections. These are predictions of what future\nclimate would be like under particular external condition\nscenarios, without assuming that any of those scenarios will\nactually occur, and they are often launched from an initial state that\nis meant to be representative of the climate at the start of the\nsimulated period, though not estimated directly from observations (see\n Section 4.4).\n Climate change projections have become a major focus of climate\nresearch and will be discussed further in\n Section 5.2\n below.\n\nRecently there have been calls for discipline-level changes in the\npractice of climate modeling, in order to better serve some of the\npurposes just mentioned. To improve climate change projections, for\ninstance, Shukla et al. (2009) call for a \u201crevolution\u201d in\nclimate modeling, such that both expertise and computing power are\nconsolidated in a few international modeling centers, allowing for\nmuch-higher-resolution simulations. Katzav and Parker (2015)\ncritically examine this and other leading proposals and reflect on\ntheir potential benefits and costs.\n",
