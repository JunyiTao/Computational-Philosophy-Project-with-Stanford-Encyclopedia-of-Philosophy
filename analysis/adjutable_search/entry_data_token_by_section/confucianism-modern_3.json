    "main_text": "Modernity and Tradition || Chinese Humanistic Culture and Western Materialist Culture\n2.2 Chinese Humanistic Culture and Western Materialist Culture\n\nTang Junyi was the most preoccupied with cultural questions and\ncarried out the most thorough analysis of the cultural differences\nbetween China and the West, though even he was not immune from\nsimplifying \u201cthe West\u201d into one. His views on the starting\npoints of Chinese and Greek philosophy are very similar, but he was\nmore thoughtful about what constitutes culture and why an\nunderstanding of culture is important. Culture is what separate humans\nfrom other animals. He writes,\n\n\nCulture is the manifestation or creation of human spiritual\nactivity\u2026. By spiritual activity, I mean activity which is led\nby a self-conscious ideal or purpose, and which self-consciously seeks\nto realize this ideal or purpose. (TJCW 12: 1)\n\n\nAnimals have awareness and perhaps form concepts, but do not\nself-consciously guide their behavior in order to realize particular\nideals in the world: this is uniquely human (TJCW 12: 379). This is\nprecisely what Tang means by spirit and spiritual activity:\n\n\nWhat makes spirit become spirit is that the mind must self-consciously\naffirm or uphold an ideal, and make realizing this ideal and value its\naspiration. (TJCW 12: 3)\n\n\nVarious cultural practices and institutions, which for Tang\nencompasses everything from the family to the economy, art, the\nsciences, and more, are products of action to realize some ideal (Tan\n2009: 548). Chinese culture is the result of attempts to realize\nChinese ideals.\n\nA conclusion he draws from this, that he never makes fully explicit,\nis that we can use this concept as a standard to evaluate at least\ncertain aspects of a culture. A culture may fail to realize its ideals\nor pursue them through inefficient means. It might have conflicting\nideals which cannot be simultaneously realized. More controversially,\nTang believes we can evaluate the ideals themselves according to\nwhether they are reasonable or not. One aspect of this is logical\nconsistency, but it also includes cohering with human nature and the\njudgments of moral intuition (liangzhi \u826f\u77e5)\n(Fr\u00f6hlich 2017: 143). Ideals that are not reflective of human\nnature will not lead to a good culture even if realized fully. Mou and\nXu would certainly agree. While all found much to admire in modern\nWestern culture, they were also strongly critical of excessive\nindividualism, social alienation, undue focus on satisfying desires,\nand attenuated moral and spiritual life. While others in China at the\ntime favored complete Westernization to sweep away the old culture,\nthey were convinced\u00a0that this would be a mistake (Ro\u0161ker\n2016: 110). What they wanted were the aspects of modernity that would\nbetter realize traditional Chinese ideals.\n\nTang Junyi\u2019s examination of Western culture illustrates these\ncriticisms in more detail. Since culture is a human creation, the\nspirit underlying all culture (wenhua \u6587\u5316) is\nthe humanistic (renwen \u4eba\u6587) spirit (TJCW 11: 1).\nTrue humanism for Tang affirms and respects the existence and value of\nhuman nature, personality, human relationships, culture, and history\n(TJCW 11: 2). Western culture excelled at non-humanism (science and\nmathematics) and trans-humanism (religion), but not humanism (TJCW 11:\n25). Western humanism ended up turning to either God or nature and\nfailed to affirm properly the existence of the virtuous person. It\neither treated people as objects to be investigated like other parts\nof nature (as in science) or as essentially flawed products of\noriginal sin. It was always caught between science and religion (TJCW\n11: 63). It failed to put the person as subject first. The basis of\nhumanism has to be the value of the individual, and the unlimited\nvalue of the individual and basis for the ultimate dignity of\nindividual is the moral mind inherent in everyone (TJCW 11: 185). This\nis precisely the strength of Chinese humanism, and why Chinese culture\nmust be the basis of a healthy humanistic tradition.\n\nTang was critical of monotheistic religions (Christianity in\nparticular) for being overly focused on the transcendent and not\nenough on this world, but the modern world is even worse because it\ndisregards the transcendent aspect of humanity entirely. Tang credited\nChristianity with recognizing the absolute significance and highest\ndignity of the person, which made it the origin of modern Western\nhumanism (TJCW 11: 34\u201335). However, religion centered on a\ntranscendent god cannot be a stable foundation for humanism.\nChristianity does not affirm the ultimate value of the person. What\nhas ultimate value is God, the creator of the person, not the person,\nand the person can never become God (TJCW 26: 2.201, 265). As a result\nChristianity did not sufficiently affirm the value of the person or\naction in this world, instead seeking transcendence. Still, it\naffirmed the importance of morality and spirituality in a way that was\nlost in the transition to modernity.\n\nModern Western culture has the opposite problem, treating people as\nobjects of study and losing the importance of the subject and\nspiritual aspect of humanity. In Tang\u2019s scheme, a life that\nrecognizes the moral and spiritual qualities of human beings and the\nworld, recognizing that these have a transcendent aspect beyond the\nmaterial, is on a higher level than one that focuses only on the\nmaterial world (Chiu 2016:\n 133).[1]\n And that turn away from the higher level of transcendence toward the\nsensible is precisely what happened during the modern period, in his\nview (Metzger 2005: 248\u201351; Van den Stock 2021: 233).\nEnlightenment developments in mathematics and science treated the\nworld as an object for study and increasingly such study was\nabstracted in general laws and mathematical formulas. The British\nempirical tradition strongly emphasized that sensory experience is the\nfoundation of all knowledge. Art and literature turned from spiritual\nto worldly themes as well. This focus on the sensible led to\nutilitarianism, which focused on satisfying felt desires, and the\ndevelopment of modern economics which treats people as independent\nindividuals pursuing their personal preferences (TJCW 26:\n2.345\u201346). Individualism emphasized uniqueness of personality,\nnot common humanity (Metzger 1977: 42\u201345). This reduced people\nto animals who just follow their desires (TJCW 9: 328\u201329;\nFr\u00f6hlich 2017: 83\u201384). The dignity of being human was lost,\nand that is the fundamental cause of cultural problems. Morality needs\nto be built on spiritual value, not instrumental or utilitarian value\n(Chiu 2023: 4\u20135; Van den Stock 2016: 253). This is why\npreserving Chinese culture is critical, because it properly recognizes\nthe inner spiritual value of humanity.\n\nThe distaste for utilitarianism and treating desires as central is\ncommon in modern Confucianism, as is the belief that the strength of\nChinese culture is that it recognizes that people have values beyond\ndesire satisfaction. Xu Fuguan said that Western utilitarian\nindividualism has nothing to do with Chinese culture (Xu 1952 [2022:\n133]). The distinctive feature of Chinese culture is valuing the\nheart-mind which is distinct from and above desires (Xu 1953 [2022:\n174\u201376]). Mou Zongsan similarly distinguished moral values from\ndesires based on biology, which are fundamentally different categories\n(MZCW 22: 5\u20136). Xiong Shili did not discuss utilitarianism in\nany detail, but like Tang, condemned treating people as objects for\nstudy and making objective analysis the basis for all knowledge (Xiong\n1932 [2015: 181\u201382]). Chinese culture correctly emphasized\nseeking wisdom in oneself and one\u2019s fundamental nature. This is\nthe wisdom worth having (Xiong 1932 [2015: 298\u201399]). The common\nthread is that while modern Western culture (\u201cmodern\u201d and\n\u201cWestern\u201d are virtually synonyms in this discourse)\n(Ro\u0161ker 2016: 16) has great achievements worth learning from,\nmorally it is completely deficient. They have been aptly called\ncultural nationalists because of their commitment to certain Chinese\ncultural values, inspired by Xiong Shili (N. S. Chan 2011:\n65\u201394; Fr\u00f6hlich 2017: 85\u201386; Xu 1980b). The strength\nof Chinese culture, and why it must be preserved and indeed spread, is\nthat it values the person correctly, as a subject with ultimate value.\nModernity can help realize this value by improving people\u2019s\nmaterial lives, but the humanistic values must be preserved.\n",
