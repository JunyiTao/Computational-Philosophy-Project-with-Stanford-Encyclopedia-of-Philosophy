    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThere are three questions raised by the title of this entry. The first\nis whether it is anachronistic. Is empiricism not a modern view? Can\nwe attribute it to ancient and medieval thinkers? The charge of\nanachronism might, perhaps, be warranted if empiricism referred to a\nsingle set of beliefs. As we shall see, however, the term covers a\nvariety of views regarding knowledge\n (sect. 2).\n Even among modern thinkers, the empiricism of John Locke\n(1632\u20131704) is not identical with that of Francis Bacon\n(1561\u20131626), and neither bears much resemblance to the\nempiricism of Rudolf Carnap (1891\u20131970), A. J. Ayer\n(1910\u20131989), or Hans Reichenbach (1891\u20131953). Yet all\nthese thinkers have an attitude in common: they adopt a certain\n\u201cstance\u201d towards knowledge (van Fraassen 2002:\n47\u201348). They all desire to keep factual claims (in the sense of\nclaims regarding contingent matters) closely related to the\ndeliverances of the senses. That attitude has ancient roots. Modern\nempiricism was not a creatio e nihilo. It revived views\nalready found in the ancient world, particularly among Hellenistic\nphilosophers (Scott 1995: 238), and the particular questions it was\nseeking to answer arose from late medieval developments.\n\nA second question has to do with the article\u2019s association of\nancient and medieval views. The philosophers discussed here are\nseparated by a thousand years. Why bring them together? This question\nis more easily answered. The intellectual renaissance of the twelfth\nand thirteenth centuries involved a revival of the work of the\nancients. In the field of philosophy this took the form of a\nrediscovery of the works of Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE), by way of\nLatin translations from Arabic sources and Greek texts from the\nByzantine world. Indeed much of the philosophical writing of this\nperiod was done by way of commentaries on Aristotle. Medieval\nphilosophers were also influenced by writers from a later age, such as\nPlotinus (205\u2013270 CE), Dionysius the Areopagite (5th\u20136th\ncentury CE), and St Augustine (354\u2013430 CE). But since these\nwriters were themselves influenced by Aristotle\u2019s predecessor,\nPlato (427\u2013347 BCE), this aspect of medieval philosophy also has\nancient roots.\n\nA third question has to do with the scope of the discussion. The\ntradition of philosophy being discussed here is that which began in\nthe Greek city states of the sixth and fifth centuries BCE. But\nempiricist views are also found outside of what is (somewhat\nmisleadingly) called the \u2018Western\u2019 philosophical\ntradition. The closest parallels are to be found among the\nLok\u0101yata (C\u0101rv\u0101ka), one of the n\u0101stika\n(non-orthodox) schools of Indian philosophy that existed in the sixth\nand seventh centuries CE. These thinkers are reported to have held\nthat sensory perception is the only reliable means of knowledge and to\nhave rejected the validity of inferences to unobservable entities\n(Chatterjee & Datta 2004: 54\u201359). The Buddha (ca.\n485\u2013405 BCE) could be said to be an empiricist, insofar as he\nbased his dharma (teaching) on experience rather than\nauthority or reason. But the Buddhist idea of experience is broader\nthan that held by most empiricists (Jayatilleke 1963: 463\u201364\n[para. 793]). The twelve \u0101yatanas (sensory domains) of\nBuddhist tradition include the mind as well as the bodily senses and\nmeditation is thought capable of producing higher forms of knowledge\n(the abhij\u00f1\u0101s) that are independent of sensory\nperception. Finally, we can find discussions of sense perception\nwithin classical Chinese philosophy. Mozi (Mo Tzu, ca. 480\u2013392\nBCE), for instance, ranked everyday experience among the three\ncriteria of reliable knowledge (Mozi 35.3), while the more sceptical\nXunzi (Hs\u00fcn Tzu, ca. 312\u2013210 BCE) pointed out how easily\nthe senses are deceived (Xunzi 21.8). But while it would be\ninteresting to explore these traditions, empiricism does not play as\ncentral a role in any of them as it does in the history of Western\nphilosophy.\n\nThe question of scope also arises when it comes to the subject matter\nof the article, which is empiricism as a doctrine rather than as a\npractice. From the very beginning of what the Greeks called \u201cthe\ninvestigation of nature\u201d (h\u0113 peri phuse\u014ds\nhistoria), there have been those who studied the natural world by\nmeans of careful observation. There were medical writers who observed\nand recorded symptoms, astronomers who observed the movements of the\nheavens, and students of music who placed their ears \u201cclose [to\ntheir instruments] as though trying to hear what their neighbours were\nsaying\u201d (Plato Rep. 531a6\u20137). These people\nbelieved it was important to learn from experience (empeiria,\nin Aristotle\u2019s Greek). But they did not formulate a theory about\nlearning from experience. It is the theory of learning from experience\nthat will be the focus of the present study.\n",
