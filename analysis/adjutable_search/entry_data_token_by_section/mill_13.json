    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Practical Philosophy || Equality, the Sexes, and the Nineteenth Century\n4.4 Equality, the Sexes, and the Nineteenth Century\n\nThe nineteenth century was a period coming to terms with the rise of\ndemocracy, and this is reflected in the concerns of its social\nphilosophy. Mill\u2019s writings in this area are no exception. His\nengagement with the question of how society and its institutions ought\nto be organized is of course guided by an abstract commitment to\ngeneral happiness as the measure of the success of all human\npractice\u2014but it is also deeply attentive to the concrete\npossibilities and dangers of the newly emerging democratic era, and\nhow they relate to this overarching goal (Skorupski 2006).\n\nInfluenced by Tocqueville, Mill held that the great trend of his own\nperiod was a falling away of aristocratic mores and a growth\nof\n equality.[7]\n Mill\u2019s distinctively English take on modern Europe\u2019s\n\u201cirresistible tendency to equality of conditions\u201d\ncharacterised the spread of equality as a manifestation of \u201cthe\ngrowth of the middle class\u201d (De Tocqueville on Democracy in\nAmerica [II], XVIII: 150, 196). Although modern Europe had not\nannihilated the class distinctions of earlier periods, in Mill\u2019s\nview, such differences were becoming less and less influential on\nsocial norms. Wealth, education, status, and therefore power, he held,\nwere amassing with a socially and politically dominant middle class,\nwhose shared commercial traits and interests dictated equality as the\nemerging rule.\n\nMill believes that this trend presents a chance for the improvement of\nsociety\u2014in this sense, he stands as the heir to Bentham and\nJames Mill in trying to drive forward the agenda of modernisation.\nBut, like many of his nineteenth-century contemporaries\u2014in\nparticular, conservative social critics such as Coleridge and\nCarlyle\u2014he also sees that the newly emerging order carries with\nit newly emerging dangers. His aim was therefore to ameliorate the\nnegative effects of the rise of equality, while capitalising on the\nopportunity it presented for reform.\n\nThe most pressing need for reform in this situation, Mill thought, was\nthe removal of structures of discrimination and oppression against\nwomen. Mill held, on the grounds of associationist psychology, that\nhuman character is wholly a product of upbringing. As such, he was\nsuspicious of the then common claim that women had a different nature\nfrom men\u2014and that the sexes were therefore naturally suited for\ndifferent roles within the family and society more broadly.\n\n\n[N]o one can safely pronounce that if women\u2019s nature were left\nto choose its direction as freely as men\u2019s, and if no artificial\nbent were attempted to be given to it except that required by the\nconditions of human society, and given to both sexes alike, there\nwould be any material difference, or perhaps any difference at all, in\nthe character and capacities that would unfold themselves.\n(Subjection, XXI: 305)\n\n\nTo the extent that the sexes in general exhibit different character\ntraits, these traits are the product of upbringing into\nstereotypes, rather the justification for such stereotypes.\nSo too for differences that are claimed to exist naturally between the\nraces, and to justify the authority of one set of individuals over\nanother (The Negro Question, XII: 93). With the growth of\nequality that came with a dominant middle class, Mill held, these\nforms of oppression stood out all the more clearly, and the time was\ntherefore ripe to dismantle such practices of discrimination.\n\nSuch practices were, Mill held, objectionable on the grounds of\n\u201csocial expediency\u201d\u2014that they were detrimental to\noverall utility (Subjection, XXI: 64; cf. Admission of\nWomen to Franchise, XXVIII: 152). The denial of the vote harmed\nthe disenfranchised on two grounds. Firstly, their\ninterests\u2014interests which might diverge in significant ways from\nother groups (Autobiography, I: 107)\u2014went unrepresented\nin Parliament, and were therefore liable to frustration. Secondly, to\ndeny individuals access to political participation was to deny them\naccess to an important aspect of the good and happy life.\n\n\n[A]n equal right to be heard\u2014to have a share in influencing the\naffairs of the country\u2014to be consulted, to be spoken to, and to\nhave agreements and considerations turning upon politics addressed to\none\u2014tended to elevate and educate the self-respect of the man\n[\u2026] To give people an interest in politics and in the\nmanagement of their own affairs was the grand cultivator of mankind\n[\u2026] That was one of the reasons why he wanted women to have\nvotes; they needed cultivation as well as men. (Westminster\nElection 1865 [4], XXVIII: 39; see also Considerations,\nXIX: 469)\n\n\nFor these reasons, Mill fought against political discrimination\nthroughout his life, both as a philosopher and a Member of Parliament\n(Kinzer, Robson and Robson 1992; Varouxakis 2013). We shall return to\nthe complexities of Mill\u2019s views on political democracy below\n (section 4.7),\n but in the context of discussion of equality, we should note that\nMill was just as critical of social forms of discrimination as of the\ndenial of the vote to women. Barriers to education and the\nprofessions, he held, were as much in need of reform as barriers to\nrepresentation (Subjection, XXI: 300). But his most vehement\ncriticisms were made of the institution of marriage, as practiced in\nhis own time.\n\nMarriage\u2014which in this period deprived the wife of property and\nlegal personhood, and forced total obedience to a husband\u2014was,\nMill held, akin to slavery (Subjection, XXI: 271). Often, he\nobserved, it involved physical violence. But even where this was not\nthe case, the preparation for and participation in such unequal\npartnerships caused women to develop constrained, artificial, and\nsubmissive personalities. And not only was it degrading for women to\nbe held in such a position of slavery\u2014exercising such domination\nwas debasing to men, corrupting their personalities, too\n(Subjection, XXI: 321). The prevalence of such a vicious\npower-relationship in a central area of human life cried out for\nrenovation. The only circumstances in which marriage could be a\npositive institution, adding to human happiness, was one in which men\nand women were treated with total equality (Miller 2017).\n",
