(Turing 1936 [2004: 59, 75])\n\n\nHe also described argument I as a \u201cdirect appeal to\nintuition\u201d (Turing 1936 [2004: 75]). The appeal he is talking\nabout concerns our understanding of which features of human\ncomputation are the essential features (some examples of\ninessential features are that human computers eat, breathe,\nand sleep).\n\nIn outline, argument I runs as follows: Given that human computation\nhas these (and only these) essential features\u2014and here\nTuring supplied a list of features\u2014then, whichever human\ncomputation is specified, a Turing machine can be designed to carry\nout the computation. Therefore, the Turing-machine computable numbers\ninclude all numbers that would naturally be regarded as computable\n(Turing\u2019s thesis).\n4.3.1 Turing\u2019s analysis\n\nTuring\u2019s list of the essential features of human computation is\nas follows (Turing 1936 [2004: 75\u201376]):\n\nComputers write symbols on two-dimensional sheets of\npaper, which may be considered to be (or may actually be) divided up\ninto squares, each square containing no more than a single individual\nsymbol.\nThe computer is not able to recognize, or print,\nmore than a finite number of different types of individual\nsymbol.\nThe computer is not able to observe an unlimited\nnumber of squares all at once\u2014if he or she wishes to observe\nmore squares than can be taken in at one time, then successive\nobservations must be made. (Say the maximum number of squares the\ncomputer can observe at any one moment is \\(B\\), where \\(B\\) is some\npositive integer.)\nWhen the computer makes a fresh observation in order\nto view more squares, none of the newly observed squares will be more\nthan a certain fixed distance away from the nearest previously\nobserved square. (Say this fixed distance consists of \\(L\\) squares,\nwhere \\(L\\) is some positive integer.)\nIn order to alter a symbol (e.g., to replace it by a\ndifferent symbol), the computer needs to be actually observing the\nsquare containing the symbol.\nThe computer\u2019s behavior at any moment is\ndetermined by the symbols that he or she is observing and his or her\n\u201cstate of mind\u201d at that moment. Moreover, the\ncomputer\u2019s state of mind at any given moment, together with the\nsymbols he or she is observing at that moment, determine the\ncomputer\u2019s state of mind at the next moment.\nThe number of states of mind that need to be taken\ninto account when describing the computer\u2019s behavior is\nfinite.\nThe operations the computer performs can be split up\ninto elementary operations. These are so simple that no more than one\nsymbol is altered in a single elementary operation.\nAll elementary operations are of one or other of the\nfollowing forms:\n\n\nA change of state of mind.\nA change of observed squares, together with a possible change of\nstate of mind.\nA change of symbol, together with a possible change of state of\nmind.\n \n\n4.3.2 Next step: \\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type Turing machines\n\nThe next step of argument I is to establish that if human computation\nhas those and only those essential features, then, whatever human\ncomputation is specified, a Turing machine can be designed to perform\nthe computation. In order to show this, Turing introduced a modified\nform of Turing machine, which can be called a\n\u201c\\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type\u201d Turing machine. A \\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type\nTuring machine has much in common with an ordinary Turing machine:\n\nA\u00a0\\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type Turing machine consists of a scanner and a\none-dimensional paper tape; the tape is divided into squares.\nThe scanner contains mechanisms that enable it to move the tape to\nthe left or right.\nThe scanner\u2019s mechanisms also enable it recognize, delete,\nand print symbols.\nThe scanner is able to recognize and print only a finite number of\ndifferent types of individual symbol.\nAt any moment, the control mechanism of the scanner will be in any\none of a finite number of internal states. Turing terms these\n\u201c\\(m\\)-configurations\u201d. He included an explanatory remark\nabout \\(m\\)-configurations in a summary in French of the central ideas\nof \u201cOn Computable Numbers\u201d: Inside the machine,\n\u201clevers, wheels, et cetera can be arranged in several ways,\ncalled \u2018\\(m\\)-configurations\u2019\u201d. (The complete\nsummary is translated in Copeland & Fan 2022.)\nThe machine\u2019s behavior at any moment is determined by its\n\\(m\\)-configuration and the symbols it is observing (i.e.,\nscanning).\nThe machine\u2019s possible behaviors are limited to moving the\ntape, deleting the symbol on an observed square, and printing a symbol\non an observed square. Each of these behaviors may be accompanied by a\nchange in \\(m\\)-configuration.\n\n\nMoving on now to the differences between ordinary Turing machines and\n\\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type machines:\n\nThe scanner of a \\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type machine can observe up to \\(B\\)\nsquares at once; whereas the scanner of an ordinary Turing machine can\nobserve only a single square of the tape at any one moment. A Turing\nmachine that is able to survey a sequence of squares all at once like\nthis is sometimes known by the (perhaps inelegant) term \u201cstring\nmachine\u201d.\nThe scanner of a \\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type machine can, in a single\noperation, move the tape up to \\(L\\) squares at once (to the left or\nright of any one of the immediately previously observed squares);\nwhereas the scanner of an ordinary machine can move the tape by only\none square in a single elementary operation.\n\n\nReturning to the argument, Turing asserted that, given his account\n1\u20139 of the essential features of human computation, a\n\\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type machine can \u201cdo the work\u201d of any human\ncomputer (1936: 77). This is because the \\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type machine\neither duplicates or can simulate each of\n features 1\u20139.\n Let us take these features in turn.\n\nFeature 1\n is simulated by the machine: The \\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type machine uses its\none-dimensional tape to mimic the computer\u2019s two-dimensional\nsheets of paper. Turing said:\n\n\nI think it will be agreed that the two-dimensional character of paper\nis no essential of computation. (Turing 1936 [2004: 75])\n\n\nHowever, some commentators note that there is room for doubt about\nthis matter. Gandy complained that Turing here argued \u201cmuch too\nbriefly\u201d, saying:\n\n\nIt is not totally obvious that calculations carried out in two (or\nthree) dimensions can be put on a one-dimensional tape and yet\npreserve the \u201clocal\u201d properties. (Gandy 1988: 81,\n82\u201383)\n\n\nDershowitz and Gurevich ask:\n\n\n[H]ow certain is it that each and every elaborate data structure used\nduring a computation can be encoded as a string, and its operations\nsimulated by effective string manipulations? (Dershowitz &\nGurevich 2008: 305)\n\n\nProgressing to the other features on Turing\u2019s list: 2, 3, 4 and\n5 are straightforwardly duplicated in the machine.\n Features 6 and 7\n are simulated, by letting the machine\u2019s \\(m\\)-configurations do\nduty for the computer\u2019s states of mind (more on that below).\n Feature 8\n is duplicated in the machine: the machine\u2019s complex operations\n(such as long multiplication and division) are built up out of\nelementary operations. Feature 9 is simulated, again by letting the\n\\(m\\)-configurations to do duty for human states of mind.\n4.3.3 Final step\n\nThe next and final step of argument I involves the statement that any\ncomputation done by a \\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type machine can also be done by an\nordinary Turing machine. This is straightforward, since by means of a\nsequence of single-square moves, the ordinary machine can simulate a\n\\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type machine\u2019s tape-moves of up to \\(L\\) squares at\nonce; and the ordinary machine can also simulate the \\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type\nmachine\u2019s scanning of up to \\(B\\) squares at once, by means of a\nsequence of single-square scannings (interspersed where necessary with\nchanges of \\(m\\)-configuration). Thus, if a \\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type machine\ncan \u201cdo the work\u201d of a human computer, so can an ordinary\nTuring machine.\n\nIn summary, Turing has shown the following\u2014provided his claim is\naccepted that \u201cTo each state of mind of the computer corresponds\nan \u2018\\(m\\)-configuration\u2019 of the machine\u201d: Given\nthe above account of the essential features of human computation, an\nordinary Turing machine is able to do the work of any human\ncomputer. In other words: Subject to that proviso and that given,\nhe has established his thesis that the numbers computable by an\nordinary Turing machine include all numbers which would naturally be\nregarded as computable.\n4.3.4 States of mind, and argument III\n\nBut should Turing\u2019s claim about the correspondence of states of\nmind and \\(m\\)-configurations be accepted? Might not human states of\nmind greatly surpass arrangements of levers and wheels? Might not the\ncomputer\u2019s states of mind sometimes determine him or her to\nchange the symbols in a way that a \\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type machine\ncannot?\n\nTuring addressed worries about the correspondence between states of\nmind and \\(m\\)-configurations in his supplementary argument III, which\nhe said \u201cmay be regarded as a modification of I\u201d (1936:\n79). Here he argued that reference to the computer\u2019s states of\nmind can be avoided altogether, by talking instead about what he\ncalled a \u201cnote of instructions\u201d. A note of instructions,\nhe said, is \u201ca more definite and physical counterpart\u201d of\na state of mind. Each step of the human computation can be regarded as\nbeing governed by a note of instructions\u2014by means of following\nthe instructions in the note, the computer will know what operation to\nperform at that step (erase, print, or move). Turing envisaged the\ncomputer preparing new notes on the fly, as the computation\nprogresses: \u201cThe note of instructions must enable him [the\ncomputer] to carry out one step and write the next note\u201d. Each\nnote is in effect a tiny computer program, which both carries out a\nsingle step of the computation and also writes the program that is to\nbe used at the next step.\n\nOnce instruction notes are in the picture, there is no need to refer\nto the human computer\u2019s states of mind:\n\n\nthe state of progress of the computation at any stage is completely\ndetermined by the note of instructions and the symbols on the tape.\n(Turing 1936 [2004: 79])\n\n\nAnother\u2014related\u2014way of answering the worry that human\nstates of mind might surpass the machine\u2019s \\(m\\)-configurations\nis to point out that, even if this were true, it would make no\nessential difference to argument I. This is because of\n feature 3\n and\n feature 7\n (Section 4.3.1): The number of states of mind that need to be taken\ninto account is finite, and the maximum number of squares that the\ncomputer can observe at any one moment is \\(B\\) (a finite number).\n\nGiven\n feature 7,\n it follows that no matter how fancy a state of mind might be, the\ncomputer\u2019s relevant behaviors when in that state of mind can be\nencapsulated by means of finite table. Each row of the table will be\nof the following form: If the observed symbols are such-and-such, then\nperform elementary operation so-and-so (where the elementary\noperations are as specified in\n feature 9).\n Since only a finite number of states of mind are in consideration\n (feature 3)\u2014say\n \\(n\\)\u2014all necessary information about the computer\u2019s\nstates of mind can be encapsulated in a list of \\(n\\) such tables.\nThis list consists of finitely many symbols, and therefore it can be\nplaced on the tape of a \\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type machine in advance of the\nmachine beginning its emulation of the human computer. (This is akin\nto writing a program on the tape of a universal Turing machine.) The\n\\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type machine consults the list at each step of the\ncomputation, and the machine\u2019s behavior at every step is\ncompletely determined by the list together with the currently observed\nsymbols.\n\nTo conclude: no matter what powers might be accorded to the human\ncomputer\u2019s states of mind, a \\(B\\)-\\(L\\)-type machine can\nnevertheless \u201cdo the work\u201d of the computer, so long as\nonly finitely many states of mind need be taken into consideration\n(given, of course, the remainder of Turing\u2019s account of the\nessential features of computation).\n4.3.5 Turing\u2019s theorem\n\nNow that the proviso mentioned above about states of mind has been\ncleared out of the way, Turing\u2019s achievement in argument I can\nbe summed up like this: He has, in Gandy\u2019s phrase,\n\u201coutlined a proof\u201d of a theorem (Gandy 1980: 124).\n\n\nTuring\u2019s computation theorem:\n\nThis account of the essential features of human computation implies\nTuring\u2019s thesis.\n\n\nIt should by now be completely clear why Turing called argument I a\n\u201cdirect appeal to intuition\u201d. If one\u2019s intuition\ntells one that Turing\u2019s account of the essential features of\nhuman computation is correct, then the theorem can be applied and\nTuring\u2019s thesis is secured.\n\nHowever, Turing\u2019s account is not immune from skepticism. Some\nskeptical questions are: Might there be aspects of human computation\nthat Turing has overlooked? Might a computer who is limited by\n1\u20139 be unable to perform some calculations that can be\ndone by a human computer not so restricted? Also, must the number of\nstates of mind that need to be taken into account when describing the\ncomputer\u2019s behavior always be finite? G\u00f6del thought the\nnumber of Turing\u2019s \u201cdistinguishable states of mind\u201d\nmay \u201cconverge toward infinity\u201d, saying\n\n\nWhat Turing disregards completely is the fact that mind, in its\nuse, is not static, but constantly developing. (G\u00f6del 1972:\n306)\n\n\nIndeed, what are the grounds supposed to be for thinking that\n1\u20139 are true? Are these claims supposed to be grounded in the\nnature and limitations of the human sense organs and the human mind?\nOr are they supposed to be grounded in some other way, e.g., in the\nfundamental nature of effective methods?\n\nTuring\u2019s argument I is a towering landmark and there is now a\nsizable literature on these and other questions concerning it. For\nmore about this important argument see, for starters, Sieg 1994, 2008;\nShagrir 2006; and Copeland & Shagrir 2013.\n4.4 Turing\u2019s argument II\n4.4.1 Calculating in a logic\n\nKleene, in his survey of evidence for the Church-Turing thesis, listed\na type of argument based on symbolic logic (Kleene 1952: 322\u20133).\n(He called these category \u201cD\u201d arguments.) Arguments of\nthis type commence by introducing a plausible alternative method of\ncharacterizing effectively calculable functions (or, in Turing\u2019s\ncase, computable functions or numbers). The alternative method\ninvolves derivability in one or another symbolic logic: The concept of\neffective calculability (or of computability) is characterized in\nterms of calculability within the logic (see\n Section 3.3).\n Schematically, the characterization is of the form: A function is\neffectively calculable (or computable) if each successive value of the\nfunction is derivable within the logic. The next step of the argument\nis then to establish that the new characterization (whatever it is) is\nequivalent to the old. In Church\u2019s case, this amounts to arguing\nthat the new characterization is equivalent to his characterization in\nterms of either recursiveness or \u03bb-definability. Finally, the\nconclusion that the new and previous characterizations are equivalent\nis claimed as further evidence in favor of the Church-Turing\nthesis.\n\nIn his survey, Kleene illustrated this approach by describing an\nargument of Church\u2019s (Church 1936a: 357\u2013358).\nTuring\u2019s argument II is also of this type, but, curiously,\nKleene did not mention it (despite assigning five pages of his 1952\nsurvey to Turing\u2019s argument I).\n4.4.2 Church\u2019s \u201cstep-by-step\u201d argument\n\nIt is instructive to examine Church\u2019s argument\u2014which Gandy\ndubbed the \u201cstep-by-step\u201d argument (Gandy 1988:\n77)\u2014before considering Turing\u2019s II. Church introduced the\nfollowing alternative method, describing it as among the\n\u201cmethods which naturally suggest themselves\u201d in connection\nwith defining effective calculability:\n\n\na function \\(F\\) (of one positive integer) [is defined] to be\neffectively calculable if, for every positive integer \\(m\\), there\nexists a positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(F(m) = n\\) is a provable\ntheorem. (Church 1936a: 358)\n\n\nChurch did not specify any particular symbolic logic. He merely\nstipulated a number of general conditions that the logic must satisfy\n(1936a: 357). These included the stipulations that the list of axioms\nof the logic must be either finite or enumerably infinite, and that\neach rule of the logic must specify an \u201ceffectively calculable\noperation\u201d (the latter is necessary, he said, if the logic\n\u201cis to serve at all the purposes for which a system of symbolic\nlogic is usually intended\u201d). Having introduced this alternative\nmethod of characterizing effective calculability, Church then went on\nto argue that every function (of one positive integer) that is\n\u201ccalculable within the logic\u201d in this way is also\nrecursive. He concluded, in support of Church\u2019s thesis, that the\nnew method produces \u201cno more general definition of effective\ncalculability than that proposed\u201d, i.e., in terms of\nrecursiveness (1936a: 358).\n4.4.3 Turing\u2019s variant\n\nTuring\u2019s prefatory remarks to argument II bring out its broad\nsimilarity to Church\u2019s argument. Turing described II as being a\n\u201cproof of the equivalence of two definitions\u201d,\nadding\u2014\u201cin case the new definition has a greater intuitive\nappeal\u201d (1936 [2004: 75]).\n\nTuring\u2019s argument, unlike Church\u2019s, does involve a\nspecific symbolic logic, namely Hilbert\u2019s first-order predicate\ncalculus. Argument II hinges on a proposition that can be called\n\n\nTuring\u2019s provability theorem:\n\nEvery formula provable in Hilbert\u2019s first-order predicate\ncalculus can be proved by the universal Turing machine. (See Turing\n1936 [2004: 77].)\n\n\nThe alternative method considered by Turing (which is similar to\nChurch\u2019s) characterizes a computable number (or sequence) in\nterms of statements each of which supplies the next digit of the\nnumber (or sequence). The number (sequence) is said to be computable\nif each such statement is provable in Hilbert\u2019s calculus (the\nidea being that, if this is so, then Hilbert\u2019s calculus may be\nused to calculate\u2014or compute\u2014the digits of the number one\nby one). Employing the provability theorem, Turing then showed the\nfollowing: Every number that is computable according to this\nalternative definition is also computable according to the\nTuring-machine definition (i.e., the digits of the number can be\nwritten out progressively by a Turing machine), and vice versa (Turing\n1936 [2004: 78]). In other words, he proved the equivalence of the two\ndefinitions, as promised.\n4.4.4 Comparing the Church and Turing arguments\n\nReturning to Church\u2019s step-by-step argument, there is an air of\njiggery-pokery about it. Church wished to conclude that functions\n\u201ccalculable within the logic\u201d are recursive, and, in the\ncourse of arguing for this, he found it necessary to assert that each\nrule of the logic is a recursive operation, on the basis that each\nrule is required to be an effectively calculable operation. In a\ndifferent context, he might have supported this assertion by appealing\nto Church\u2019s thesis (which says, after all, that what is\neffectively calculable is recursive). But in the present context, such\nan appeal would naturally be question-begging.\n\nNor did Church make any such appeal. (Sieg described Church\u2019s\nreasoning as \u201csemi-circular\u201d, but this seems too\nharsh\u2014there is nothing circular about it; Sieg 1994: 87, 2002:\n394.) But nor did Church offer any compelling reasons in support of\nhis assertion. He merely gave examples of systems whose rules\nare recursive operations; and also said\u2014having\nstipulated that each rule of procedure must be an effectively\ncalculable operation\u2014that he will \u201cinterpret this to\nmean that \u2026 each rule of procedure must be a recursive\noperation\u201d (1936: 357, italics added.) In short, a crucial step\nof Church\u2019s argument for Church\u2019s thesis receives\ninadequate support. Sieg famously dubbed this step the\n\u201cstumbling block\u201d in Church\u2019s argument (Sieg 1994:\n87).\n\nThere is no such difficulty in Turing\u2019s argument. Having\nselected a specific logic (Hilbert\u2019s calculus), Turing was able\nspecify a Turing machine that would \u201cfind all the provable\nformulae of the calculus\u201d, so making it indubitable that\nfunctions calculable in the logic are Turing-machine computable\n(Turing 1936 [2004: 77]). For this reason, Turing\u2019s argument II\nis to be preferred to Church\u2019s step-by-step argument.\n4.5 Kripke\u2019s version of argument II\n\nA significant recent contribution to the area has been made by Kripke\n(2013). A conventional view of the status of the Church-Turing thesis\nis that, while \u201cvery considerable intuitive evidence\u201d has\namassed for the thesis, the thesis is \u201cnot a precise enough\nissue to be itself susceptible to mathematical treatment\u201d\n(Kripke 2013: 77). Kleene gave an early expression of this now\nconventional view:\n\n\nSince our original notion of effective calculability of a function\n\u2026 is a somewhat vague intuitive one, the thesis cannot be\nproved. \u2026 While we cannot prove Church\u2019s thesis, since\nits role is to delimit precisely an hitherto vaguely conceived\ntotality, we require evidence \u2026. (Kleene 1952: 318)\n\n\nRejecting the conventional view, Kripke suggests that, on the\ncontrary, the Church-Turing thesis is susceptible to mathematical\nproof. Furthermore, he canvasses the idea that Turing himself sketched\nan argument that serves to prove the thesis.\n\nKripke attempts to build a mathematical demonstration of the\nChurch-Turing thesis around Turing\u2019s argument II. He claims that\nhis demonstration is \u201cvery close\u201d to Turing\u2019s\n(Kripke 2013: 80). However, this is debatable, since, in its detail,\nthe Kripke argument differs considerably from argument II. But one can\nat least say that Kripke\u2019s argument was inspired by\nTuring\u2019s argument II, and belongs in Kleene\u2019s category\n\u201cD\u201d (along with II and Church\u2019s step-by-step\nargument).\n\nKripke argues that the Church-Turing thesis is a corollary of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s completeness theorem for first-order predicate\ncalculus with identity. Put somewhat crudely, the latter theorem\nstates that every valid deduction (couched in the language of\nfirst-order predicate calculus with identity) is provable in\nthe calculus. In other words, the deduction of \\(B\\) from premises\n\\(A_{1},\\) \\(A_{2},\\) \u2026 \\(A_{n}\\) (where statements \\(A_{1},\\)\n\\(A_{2},\\) \u2026 \\(A_{n},\\) \\(B\\) are all in the language of\nfirst-order predicate calculus with identity) is logically valid if\nand only if \\(B\\) can be proved from \\(A_{1},\\) \\(A_{2},\\) \u2026\n\\(A_{n}\\) in the calculus.\n\nThe first step of the Kripke argument is his claim that (error-free,\nhuman) computation is itself a form of deduction:\n\n\n[A] computation is a special form of mathematical argument. One is\ngiven a set of instructions, and the steps in the computation are\nsupposed to follow\u2014follow deductively\u2014from the\ninstructions as given. So a computation is just another\nmathematical deduction, albeit one of a very specialized form.\n(Kripke 2013: 80)\n\n\nThe following two-line program in pseudo-code illustrates\nKripke\u2019s claim. The symbol \u201c\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u201d is read\n\u201cbecomes\u201d, and \u201c=\u201d as usual means identity.\nThe first instruction in the program is \\(r \\rightarrow 2\\). This\ntells the computer to place the value 2 in storage location \\(r\\)\n(assumed to be initially empty). The second instruction \\(r\n\\rightarrow r + 3\\) tells the computer to add 3 to the content of\n\\(r\\) and store the result in \\(r\\) (over-writing the previous content\nof \\(r\\)). The execution of this two-line program can be represented\nas a deduction:\n\n\n{Execution of \\(r \\rightarrow 2\\), followed immediately by execution\nof \\(r \\rightarrow r + 3\\)} logically entails that \\(r = 5\\) in the\nimmediately resulting state.\n\n\nIn the case of Turing-machine programs, Turing developed a detailed\nlogical notation for expressing all such deductions (Turing 1936).\n\n(In fact, the successful execution of any string of\ninstructions can be represented deductively in this\nfashion\u2014Kripke has not drawn attention to a feature special to\ncomputation. The instructions do not need to be ones that a computer\ncan carry out.)\n\nThe second step of Kripke\u2019s argument is to appeal to what he\nrefers to as Hilbert\u2019s thesis: this is the thesis that\nthe steps of any mathematical argument can be expressed \u201cin a\nlanguage based on first-order logic (with identity)\u201d (Kripke\n2013: 81). The practice of calling this claim \u201cHilbert\u2019s\nthesis\u201d originated in Barwise (1977: 41), but it should be noted\nthat since Hilbert regarded second-order logic as indispensable (see,\ne.g., Hilbert & Ackermann 1928: 86), the name\n\u201cHilbert\u2019s thesis\u201d is potentially misleading.\n\nApplying \u201cHilbert\u2019s thesis\u201d to Kripke\u2019s above\nquoted claim that \u201ca computation is just another mathematical\ndeduction\u201d (2013: 80) yields:\n\n\nevery (human) computation can be formalized as a valid deduction\ncouched in the language of first-order predicate calculus with\nidentity.\n\n\nNow, applying G\u00f6del\u2019s completeness theorem to this yields\nin turn:\n\n\nevery (human) computation is provable in first-order predicate\ncalculus with identity, in the sense that, given an appropriate\nformalization, each step of the computation can be derived from the\ninstructions (possibly in conjunction with ancillary premises, e.g.,\nwell-known mathematical premises, or premises concerning numbers that\nare supplied to the computer at the start of the computation).\n\n\nFinally, applying Turing\u2019s provability theorem to this\nintermediate conclusion yields the Church-Turing thesis:\n\n\nevery (human) computation can be done by Turing machine.\n\n4.6 Turing on the status of the thesis\n\nAs\n Section 3.4\n mentioned, Dershowitz and Gurevich have also argued that the\nChurch-Turing thesis is susceptible to mathematical proof (Dershowitz\n& Gurevich 2008). They offer \u201ca proof of Church\u2019s\nThesis, as G\u00f6del and others suggested may be possible\u201d\n(2008: 299), and they add:\n\n\nIn a similar way, but with a different set of basic operations, one\ncan prove Turing\u2019s Thesis, \u2026 . (Dershowitz & Gurevich\n2008: 299)\n\n\nYet Turing\u2019s own view of the status of his thesis is very\ndifferent from that expressed by Kripke, Dershowitz and Gurevich.\nAccording to Turing, his thesis is not susceptible to mathematical\nproof. He did not consider either argument I or argument II to be a\nmathematical demonstration of his thesis: he asserted that I and II,\nand indeed \u201c[a]ll arguments which can be given\u201d for the\nthesis, are\n\n\nfundamentally, appeals to intuition, and for this reason rather\nunsatisfactory mathematically. (Turing 1936 [2004: 74])\n\n\nIndeed, Turing might have regarded \u201cHilbert\u2019s\nthesis\u201d as itself an example of a proposition that can be\njustified only by appeals to intuition.\n\nTuring discussed a thesis closely related to Turing\u2019s thesis,\nnamely for every systematic method there is a corresponding\nsubstitution-puzzle (where \u201csubstitution-puzzle\u201d,\nlike \u201ccomputable by Turing machine\u201d, is a rigorously\ndefined concept). He said:\n\n\nThe statement is \u2026 one which one does not attempt to prove.\nPropaganda is more appropriate to it than proof, for its status is\nsomething between a theorem and a definition. (Turing 1954 [2004:\n588])\n\n\nProbably Turing would have taken this remark to apply equally to the\nthesis (Turing\u2019s thesis) that for every systematic method\nthere is a corresponding Turing machine.\n\nTuring also said (in handwritten material published in 2004) that the\nphrase \u201csystematic method\u201d\n\n\nis a phrase which, like many others e.g., \u201cvegetable\u201d one\nunderstands well enough in the ordinary way. But one can have\ndifficulties when speaking to greengrocers or microbiologists or when\nplaying \u201ctwenty questions\u201d. Are rhubarb and tomatoes\nvegetables or fruits? Is coal vegetable or mineral? What about coal\ngas, marrow, fossilised trees, streptococci, viruses? Has the lettuce\nI ate at lunch yet become animal? \u2026 The same sort of difficulty\narises about question c) above [Is there a systematic method by\nwhich I can answer such-and-such questions?]. An ordinary sort of\nacquaintance with the meaning of the phrase \u201csystematic\nmethod\u201d won\u2019t do, because one has got to be able to say\nquite clearly about any kind of method that might be proposed whether\nit is allowable or not. (Turing in Copeland 2004: 590)\n\n\nHere Turing is emphasizing that the term \u201csystematic\nmethod\u201d is not exact, and so in that respect is like the term\n\u201cvegetable\u201d, and unlike mathematically precise terms such\nas \u201c\u03bb-definable\u201d, \u201cTuring-machine\ncomputable\u201d, and \u201csubstitution-puzzle\u201d. Kleene\nclaimed that, since terms like \u201csystematic method\u201d and\n\u201ceffectively calculable\u201d are not exact, theses involving\nthem cannot be proved (op. cit.). Turing however did not voice a\nsimilar argument (perhaps because he saw a difficulty). The fact that\nthe term \u201csystematic method\u201d is inexact is not\nenough to show that there could be no mathematically acceptable proof\nof a thesis involving the term. Mendelson gave a graphic statement of\nthis point, writing about what is called above \u201cthe converse\nof Church\u2019s thesis\u201d\n (Section 1.5):\n\n\nThe assumption that a proof connecting intuitive and precise\nmathematical notions is impossible is patently false. In fact, half of\nCT (the \u201ceasier\u201d half), the assertion that all\npartial-recursive functions are effectively computable, is\nacknowledged to be obvious in all textbooks in recursion theory. A\nstraightforward argument can be given for it\u2026. This simple\nargument is as clear a proof as I have seen in mathematics, and it is\na proof in spite of the fact that it involves the intuitive notion of\neffective computability. (Mendelson 1990: 232\u2013233)\n\n\nYet the point that the \u201cintuitive\u201d nature of some of its\nterms does not rule out the thesis\u2019s being provable is not to\nsay that the thesis is provable. If the status of the\nChurch-Turing thesis is \u201csomething between a theorem and a\ndefinition\u201d, then the definition is presumably Church\u2019s\nproposal to \u201cdefine the notion \u2026 of an effectively\ncalculable function\u201d\n (Section 1.5)\n and the theorem is Turing\u2019s computation theorem\n (Section 4.3.5),\n i.e., that given Turing\u2019s account of the essential features of\nhuman computation, Turing\u2019s thesis is true. This theorem is\ndemonstrable, but to prove the thesis itself from the theorem, it\nwould be necessary to show, with mathematical certainty, that\nTuring\u2019s account of the essential features of human computation\nis correct. So far, no one has done this. Propaganda does seem more\nappropriate than proof.\n5. The Church-Turing Thesis and the Limits of Machines\n5.1 Two distinct theses\n\nCan the universal Turing machine perfectly simulate the behavior of\neach and any machine? The Church-Turing thesis is sometimes\nregarded as providing a statement of the logical limits of machinery,\nto the effect that the universal Turing machine is the most general\nmachine possible (and so the answer to the question just posed is\nyes.) For example:\n\n\nThat there exists a most general formulation of machine and that it\nleads to a unique set of input-output functions has come to be called\nChurch\u2019s thesis. (Newell 1980: 150)\n\n\nYet the Church-Turing thesis is a thesis about the extent of\neffective methods (therein lies its mathematical importance).\nPutting this another way, the thesis concerns what a human\nbeing can achieve when calculating by rote, using paper and\npencil (absent contingencies such as boredom, death, or insufficiency\nof paper). What a human rote-worker can achieve, and what a machine\ncan achieve, may be different.\n\nGandy was perhaps the first to distinguish explicitly between\nTuring\u2019s thesis and the very different proposition that\nwhatever can be calculated by a machine can be calculated by a\nTuring machine (Gandy 1980). Gandy called this proposition\n\u201cThesis M\u201d. He pointed out that Thesis M is in fact false\nin the case of some \u201cmachines obeying Newtonian\nmechanics\u201d, where \u201cthere may be rigid rods of arbitrary\nlengths and messengers travelling with arbitrary large\nvelocities\u201d (1980: 145). He also pointed out that Thesis M fails\nto apply to what he calls \u201cessentially analogue machines\u201d\n(1980: 125). A most interesting question is whether Thesis M is true\nof all discrete (i.e., non-analogue) machines that are\nconsistent with the actual laws of physics. This question is\ndiscussed in\n Section 6.4.\n\nThesis M is imprecise, since Gandy never explicitly specified quite\nwhat he meant by \u201ccalculated by a machine\u201d. It is useful\nto state a more definite proposition that captures the spirit of\nThesis M. This might be called the strong Church-Turing\nthesis, but on balance it seems preferable to avoid that name,\nsince the proposition in question is very different from the\nChurch-Turing thesis of 1936. The proposition will be called the\n\u201cmaximality thesis\u201d.\n\nSome more terminology: A machine \\(m\\) will be said to\ngenerate (borrowing this word from Turing 1937: 153) a\ncertain function (e.g., \\(x\\) squared) if \\(m\\) can be set up so that,\nif \\(m\\) is presented with any of the function\u2019s arguments\n(e.g., 4), \\(m\\) will carry out some sequence of processing steps, at\nthe end of which \\(m\\) produces the corresponding value of the\nfunction (16 in the example). Mutatis mutandis for functions\nthat, like addition, demand more than one argument.\n\n\nMaximality thesis:\n\nAll functions that can be generated by machine are effectively\ncomputable.\n\n\n\u201cEffectively computable\u201d is a commonly used term: A\nfunction is said to be effectively computable if (and only if) there\nis an effective method for obtaining its values. When phrased in terms\nof effective computability, the Church-Turing thesis says: All\neffectively computable functions are Turing-machine computable.\n\nClearly the Church-Turing thesis and the maximality thesis are\ndifferent theses.\n5.2 The \u201cequivalence fallacy\u201d\n\nA common argument for the maximality thesis, or an equivalent, cites\nthe fact, noted above, that many different attempts to analyse the\ninformal notion of computability in precise terms\u2014attempts by\nTuring, Church, Post, Markov, and others\u2014turned out to be\nequivalent to one another, in the sense that each analysis\nprovably picks out the same class of functions, namely those functions\ncomputable by Turing machines.\n\nAs previously mentioned, this convergence of analyses is often\nconsidered strong evidence for the Church-Turing thesis (this is the\nequivalence argument for the\n thesis\u2014Section 4.1).\n Some go further and take this convergence to be evidence also for the\nmaximality thesis. Newell, for example, presented the convergence of\nthe analyses given by Turing, Church, Post, Markov, et al., as showing\nthat\n\n\nall attempts to \u2026 formulate \u2026 general notions of\nmechanism \u2026 lead to classes of machines that are equivalent in\nthat they encompass in toto exactly the same set of\ninput-output functions. (Newell 1980: 150)\n\n\nThe various equivalent analyses, said Newell, constitute a\n\n\nlarge zoo of different formulations of maximal classes of machines.\n(ibid.)\n\n\nArguably there is a fallacy here. The analyses Newell is discussing\nare of the concept of an effective method: The equivalence of the\nanalyses bears only on the question of the extent of what is\nhumanly computable, not on the further question whether\nfunctions generatable by machines could extend beyond what is\nin principle humanly computable.\n5.3 Watching our words\n\nIt may be helpful at this point to survey some standard technical\nterminology that could set traps for the unwary.\n5.3.1 The word \u201ccomputable\u201d\n\nAs already emphasized, when Turing talks about computable numbers, he\nis talking about humanly computable numbers. He says: \u201cComputing\nis normally done by writing certain symbols on paper\u201d (1936\n[2004: 75])\u2014and normally done \u201cby human clerical labour,\nworking to fixed rules\u201d (1945 [2005: 386]). \u201cThe\ncomputer\u201d, he says, might proceed \u201cin such a desultory\nmanner that he never does more than one step at a sitting\u201d (1936\n[2004: 79]). The work of the human computer is mechanizable: \u201cWe\nmay now construct a machine\u201d\u2014the Turing\nmachine\u2014\u201cto do the work of this computer\u201d (1936\n[2004: 77]). See also\n Section 7\n for more quotations relating to this crucial point.\n\nThus, the various results in \u201cOn Computable Numbers\u201d to\nthe effect that such-and-such functions are uncomputable are\naccordingly about human computers. Turing should not be construed as\nintending to state results about the limitations of machinery. Gandy\nwrote:\n\n\nit is by no means obvious that the limitations described in\n [Section 4.3\n above] apply to mechanical devices; Turing does not claim this.\n(Gandy 1988: 84)\n\n5.3.2 Two instructive quotations\n\n\n[C]ertain functions are uncomputable in an absolute sense:\nuncomputable even by [Turing machine], and, therefore, uncomputable by\nany past, present, or future real machine. (Boolos & Jeffrey 1974:\n55)\n\n\nIn the technical logical literature, the term \u201ccomputable\u201d\nis usually used to mean \u201ceffectively computable\u201d (although\nnot always\u2014see\n Section 5.3.3).\n (\u201cEffectively computable\u201d was defined in\n Section 5.1.)\n Since Boolos and Jeffrey are using \u201ccomputable\u201d to mean\n\u201ceffectively computable\u201d, what they are saying in this\nquotation comes down to the statement that the functions in question\nare not effectively computable by any past, present, or\nfuture real machine\u2014which is true, since the functions are,\nex hypothesi, not effectively computable. However,\nto a casual reader of the literature, this statement (and others like\nit) might appear to say more than it in fact does. That a function is\nuncomputable (i.e., is effectively uncomputable), by any\npast, present, or future real machine, does not entail per se\nthat the function in question cannot be generated by some\nreal machine.\n\nThe second quotation:\n\n\nFORMAL LIMITS OF MACHINE BEHAVIORS \u2026 There are certain\nbehaviors that are \u201cuncomputable\u201d\u2014behaviors for\nwhich no formal specification can be given for a machine that\nwill exhibit that behavior. The classic example of this sort of\nlimitation is Turing\u2019s famous Halting Problem: can we\ngive a formal specification for a machine which, when provided with\nthe description of any other machine together with its\ninitial state, will \u2026 determine whether or not that machine\nwill reach its halt state? Turing proved that no such machine can be\nspecified. (Langton 1989: 12)\n\n\nWhat is proved is that no Turing machine can always\ndetermine, when provided with the description of any Turing\nmachine together with its initial state, whether or not that machine\nwill reach its halt state. Turing certainly proved nothing entailing\nthat it is impossible to specify a machine of some sort or\nother that can do what Langton describes. Thus, the\nconsiderations Langton presents do not impose any general formal\nlimits on machine behaviors\u2014only on the behaviors of Turing\nmachines. Yet the quotation gives a different impression. (In passing,\nit is worth pointing out that although the Halting Problem is very\ncommonly attributed to Turing, as Langton does here, Turing did not in\nfact formulate it. The Halting Problem originated with Davis in the\nearly 1950s (Davis 1958: 70).)\n5.3.3 Beyond effective\n\nSome authors use phrases such as \u201ccomputation in a broad\nsense\u201d, or simply \u201ccomputation\u201d, to refer to\ncomputation of a type that potentially transcends effective\ncomputation (e.g., Doyle 2002; MacLennan 2003; Shagrir & Pitowsky\n2003; Siegelmann 2003; Andr\u00e9ka, N\u00e9meti, &\nN\u00e9meti 2009; Copeland & Shagrir 2019).\n\nDoyle, for instance, suggested that equilibrating systems\nwith discrete spectra (e.g., molecules or other quantum many-body\nsystems) may illustrate a concept of computation that is wider than\neffective computation. Since \u201cequilibrating can be so easily,\nreproducibly, and mindlessly accomplished\u201d, Doyle said, we may\n\u201ctake the operation of equilibrating\u201d to be a\ncomputational operation, even if the functions computable in principle\nusing Turing-machine operations plus equilibrating include\nfunctions that are not computable by an unaided Turing machine (Doyle\n2002: 519).\n5.3.4 The word \u201cmechanical\u201d\n\nThere is a world of difference between the technical and everyday\nmeanings of \u201cmechanical\u201d. In the technical literature,\n\u201cmechanical\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d are usually used\ninterchangeably: A \u201cmechanical\u201d procedure is simply an\neffective procedure. Gandy 1988 outlines the history of this use of\nthe word \u201cmechanical\u201d.\n\nStatements like the following occur in the literature:\n\n\nTuring proposed that a certain class of abstract machines [Turing\nmachines] could perform any \u201cmechanical\u201d computing\nprocedure. (Mendelson 1964: 229)\n\n\nThis could be mistaken for Thesis M. However, \u201cmechanical\u201d\nis here being used in its technical sense, and the statement is\nnothing more than the Church-Turing thesis:\n\n\nTuring proposed that a certain class of abstract machines could\nperform any effective computing procedure.\n\n\nThe technical usage of \u201cmechanical\u201d has a tendency to\nobscure the conceptual possibility that not all machine-generatable\nfunctions are Turing-machine computable. The question \u201cCan a\nmachine implement a procedure that is not mechanical?\u201d\nmay appear self-answering\u2014yet this is what is being asked if\nThesis M and the maximality thesis are questioned.\n5.4 The strong maximality thesis\n\nThe maximality thesis has two interpretations, depending whether the\nphrase \u201ccan be generated by machine\u201d is taken in the sense\nof \u201ccan be generated by a machine conforming to the physical\nlaws of the actual world\u201d (the weak form of the thesis), or in a\nsense that quantifies over all machines, irrespective of\nconformity to the actual laws of physics (the strong form). (The\nstrong-weak terminology reflects the fact that the strong form entails\nthe weak, but not vice versa.)\n\nThe weak form will be discussed in\n Section 6.4.\n The strong form is known to be false. This can be shown by giving an\nexample of a notional machine that is capable of generating a function\nthat is not effectively computable. A single example will be provided\nhere; further examples may be found in Andr\u00e9ka et al. 2009,\nDavies 2001, Hogarth 1994, Pitowsky 1990, Siegelmann 2003, and other\npapers mentioned below.\n5.4.1 Accelerating Turing machines\n\nAccelerating Turing machines (ATMs) are exactly like standard Turing\nmachines except that their speed of operation accelerates as the\ncomputation proceeds (Stewart 1991; Copeland 1998a,b, 2002a; Copeland\n& Shagrir 2011). An ATM performs the second operation called for\nby its program in half the time taken to perform the first, the third\nin half the time taken to perform the second, and so on.\n\nIf the time taken to perform the first operation is called one\n\u201cmoment\u201d, then the second operation is performed in half a\nmoment, the third operation in quarter of a moment, and so on.\nSince \n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{2n} + \\frac{1}{2n+1} + \\ldots \\le 1, \\]\n\n\nan ATM is able to perform infinitely many operations in two moments of\noperating time. This enables ATMs to generate functions that cannot be\ncomputed by any standard Turing machine (and so, by the Church-Turing\nthesis, these functions are not effectively computable).\n\nOne example of such a function is the halting function \\(h\\).\n\\(h(n) = 1\\) if the \\(n\\)th Turing machine halts, and \\(h(n) = 0\\) if\nthe \\(n\\)th Turing machine runs on endlessly. It is well known that no\nstandard Turing machine can compute this function (Davis 1958); but an\nATM can produce any of the function\u2019s values in a finite period\nof time.\n\nWhen computing \\(h(n)\\), the ATM\u2019s first step is write\n\u201c0\u201d on a square of the tape called the answer square\n(\\(A\\)). The ATM then proceeds to simulate the actions of the \\(n\\)th\nTuring machine. If the ATM finds that the \\(n\\)th machine halts, then\nthe ATM goes on to erase the \u201c0\u201d it previously wrote on\n\\(A\\), replacing this by \u201c1\u201d. If, on the other hand, the\n\\(n\\)th machine does not halt, the ATM never returns to square \\(A\\)\nto erase the \u201c0\u201d originally written there. Either way,\nonce two moments of operating time have elapsed, \\(A\\) contains the\nvalue \\(h(n)\\) (Copeland 1998a).\n\nThis notional machine is a counterexample to the strong maximality\nthesis.\n6. Modern Versions of the Church-Turing Thesis\n6.1 The algorithmic version\n\nIn modern computer science, algorithms and effective procedures are\nassociated not primarily with humans but with machines. Accordingly,\nmany computer science textbooks formulate the Church-Turing thesis\nwithout mentioning human computers (e.g., Hopcroft & Ullman 1979;\nLewis & Papadimitriou 1981). This is despite the fact that the\nconcept of human computation lay at the heart of Turing\u2019s and\nChurch\u2019s analyses.\n\nThe variety of algorithms studied by modern computer science eclipses\nthe field as it was in Turing\u2019s day. There are now parallel\nalgorithms, distributed algorithms, interactive algorithms, analog\nalgorithms, hybrid algorithms, quantum algorithms, enzymatic\nalgorithms, bacterial foraging algorithms, slime-mold algorithms and\nmore (see e.g., Gurevich 2012; Copeland & Shagrir 2019). The\nuniversal Turing machine cannot even perform the atomic steps of\nalgorithms carried out by, e.g., a parallel system where every cell\nupdates simultaneously (in contrast to the serial Turing machine), or\nan enzymatic system (where the atomic steps involve operations such as\nselective enzyme binding).\n\nNevertheless, the universal Turing machine is still able to\ncalculate the behavior of parallel systems and enzymematic\nsystems. The algorithmic version of the Church-Turing thesis\nstates that this is true of every algorithmic system. Thus\nLewis and Papadimitriou said: \u201cwe take the Turing machine to be\na precise formal equivalent of the intuitive notion of\n\u2018algorithm\u2019\u201d (1981: 223). David Harel gave the\nfollowing (famous) formulation of the algorithmic version of the\nthesis:\n\n\nany algorithmic problem for which we can find an algorithm that can be\nprogrammed in some programming language, any language,\n\u2026 is also solvable by a Turing machine. This statement is one\nversion of the so-called Church/Turing thesis. (Harel 1992: 233)\n\n\nGiven the extent to which the concept of an algorithm has evolved\nsince the 1930s\u2014from the step-by-step labors of human computers\nto the growth of slime mold\u2014interesting questions arise. Will\nthe concept continue to evolve? What are the limits, if any, on this\nevolution? Could the concept evolve in such that a way that the\nalgorithmic version of the Church-Turing thesis is no longer\nuniversally true? Returning to Doyle\u2019s suggestions about\nequilibrating systems (in\n Section 5.3.3),\n Doyle\u2019s claim is essentially that the operation of\nequilibrating could reasonably be regarded as a basic step of some\neffective procedures or algorithms\u2014whether or not the\nresulting algorithms satisfy the algorithmic version of the\nChurch-Turing thesis. (See Copeland & Shagrir 2019 for further\ndiscussion.)\n\nIn summary, the algorithmic version of the Church-Turing thesis is\nbroader than the original thesis, in that Church and Turing considered\nessentially only a single type of algorithm, effective step-by-step\ncalculations on paper. The algorithmic version is also perhaps less\nsecure than the original thesis.\n6.2 Computational complexity: the Extended Church-Turing thesis\n\nThe Turing machine now holds a central place not only in computability\ntheory but also in complexity theory. Quantum computation researchers\nBernstein and Vazirani say:\n\n\nJust as the theory of computability has its foundations in the\nChurch-Turing thesis, computational complexity theory rests upon a\nmodern strengthening of this thesis. (Bernstein & Vazirani 1997:\n1411)\n\n\nThere are in fact two different complexity-theoretic versions of the\nChurch-Turing thesis in the modern computer science literature. Both\nare referred to as the \u201cExtended Church-Turing thesis\u201d.\nThe first was presented by Yao in 2003:\n\n\nThe Extended Church-Turing Thesis (ECT) makes the \u2026\nassertion that the Turing machine model is also as efficient as any\ncomputing device can be. That is, if a function is computable by some\nhardware device in time \\(T(n)\\) for input of size \\(n\\), then it is\ncomputable by a Turing machine in time \\((T(n))^k\\) for some fixed\n\\(k\\) (dependent on the problem). (Yao 2003: 100\u2013101)\n\n\nYao points out that ECT has a powerful implication:\n\n\nat least in principle, to make future computers more efficient, one\nonly needs to focus on improving the implementation technology of\npresent-day computer designs. (2003: 101)\n\n\nUnlike the original Church-Turing thesis (whose status is\n\u201csomething between\u201d a theorem and a definition) ECT is\nneither a logico-mathematical theorem nor a definition. If it is true,\nthen its truth is a consequence of the laws of physics\u2014and it\nmight not be true. (Although it is trivial if, contrary to a standard\nbut unproved assumption in computer science, P = NP.)\n\nThe second complexity-theoretic version of the thesis involves the\nconcept of a probabilistic Turing machine (due to Rabin &\nScott 1959). Vazirani and Aharonov state the thesis:\n\n\n[T]he extended Church-Turing thesis \u2026 asserts that any\nreasonable computational model can be simulated efficiently by the\nstandard model of classical computation, namely, a probabilistic\nTuring machine. (Aharonov & Vazirani 2013: 329)\n\n\nThese two related theses differ considerably from the original\nChurch-Turing thesis, not least in that both extended theses are\nempirical hypotheses. Moreover, there is ongoing debate as to\nwhether quantum computers in fact falsify these theses. (For an\nintroduction to this debate see Copeland & Shagrir 2019, and for a\nmore detailed treatment see Aharonov & Vazirani 2013.)\n6.3 Brain simulation and the Church-Turing thesis\n\nIt is sometimes said that the Church-Turing thesis has implications\nconcerning the scope of computational simulation. For example, Searle\nwrites:\n\n\nCan the operations of the brain be simulated on a digital computer?\n\u2026 The answer seems to me \u2026 demonstrably\n\u201cYes\u201d \u2026 That is, naturally interpreted, the\nquestion means: Is there some description of the brain such that under\nthat description you could do a computational simulation of the\noperations of the brain. But given Church\u2019s thesis that anything\nthat can be given a precise enough characterization as a set of steps\ncan be simulated on a digital computer, it follows trivially that the\nquestion has an affirmative answer. (Searle 1992: 200)\n\n\nAnother example:\n\n\nwe can depend on there being a Turing machine that captures the\nfunctional relations of the brain,\n\n\nfor so long as\n\n\nthese relations between input and output are functionally well-behaved\nenough to be describable by \u2026 mathematical relationships\n\u2026 we know that some specific version of a Turing machine will\nbe able to mimic them. (Guttenplan 1994: 595)\n\n\nAndr\u00e9ka, N\u00e9meti and N\u00e9meti state a more general\nthesis about the power of Turing machines to simulate other\nsystems:\n\n\n[T]he Physical Church-Turing Thesis \u2026 is the conjecture that\nwhatever physical computing device (in the broader sense) or physical\nthought-experiment will be designed by any future civilization, it\nwill always be simulateable by a Turing machine. (Andr\u00e9ka,\nN\u00e9meti, & N\u00e9meti 2009: 500)\n\n\nAndr\u00e9ka, N\u00e9meti, and N\u00e9meti even say that the\nthesis they state here \u201cwas formulated and generally accepted in\nthe 1930s\u201d (ibid.).\n\nYet it was not a thesis about the simulation of physical\nsystems that Church and Turing formulated in the 1930s, but rather a\ncompletely different thesis concerning human computation\u2014and it\nwas the latter thesis that became generally accepted during the 1930s\nand 1940s.\n\nIt certainly muddies the waters to call a thesis about simulation\n\u201cChurch\u2019s thesis\u201d or the \u201cChurch-Turing\nthesis\u201d, because the arguments that Church and Turing used to\nsupport their actual theses go no way at all towards supporting the\ntheses set out in the several quotations above. Nevertheless, what can\nbe termed the \u201cSimulation thesis\u201d has its place in the\npresent catalogue of modern forms of the Church-Turing thesis:\n\n\nSimulation thesis:\n\nAny system whose operations can be characterized as a set of steps\n(Searle) or whose input-output relations are describable by\nmathematical relationships (Guttenplan) can be simulated by a Turing\nmachine.\n\n\nIf the Simulation thesis is intended to cover all possible systems\nthen it is surely false, since Doyle\u2019s envisaged equilibrating\nsystems falsify it\n (Section 5.3.3).\n If, on the other hand, the thesis is intended to cover only actual\nphysical systems, including brains, then the Simulation thesis is,\nlike the Extended Church-Turing thesis, an empirical\nthesis\u2014and so is very different from Turing\u2019s thesis and\nChurch\u2019s thesis. The truth of the \u201cactual physical\nsystems\u201d version of the Simulation thesis depends on the laws of\nphysics.\n\nOne potential objection that any upholder of the Simulation thesis\nwill need to confront parallels a difficulty that Gandy raised for\nThesis M\n (Section 5.1).\n Physical systems that are not discrete\u2014such as Gandy\u2019s\n\u201cessentially analogue machines\u201d\u2014appear to falsify\nthe Simulation thesis, since the variables of a system with continuous\ndynamics take arbitrary real numbers as their values, whereas a Turing\nmachine is restricted to computable real numbers, and so\ncannot fully simulate the continuous system.\n\nThis brings the discussion squarely to one of the most interesting\ntopics in the area, so-called \u201cphysical versions\u201d of the\nChurch-Turing thesis.\n6.4 The Church-Turing thesis and physics\n6.4.1 The Deutsch-Wolfram thesis\n\nIn 1985, Wolfram formulated a thesis that he described as \u201ca\nphysical form of the Church-Turing hypothesis\u201d:\n\n\n[U]niversal computers are as powerful in their computational\ncapacities as any physically realizable system can be, so that they\ncan simulate any physical system. (Wolfram 1985: 735)\n\n\nDeutsch (who laid the foundations of quantum computation)\nindependently stated a similar thesis, again in 1985, and also\ndescribed it as a \u201cphysical version\u201d of the Church-Turing\nthesis:\n\n\nI can now state the physical version of the Church-Turing principle:\n\u201cEvery finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly\nsimulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite\nmeans\u201d. This formulation is both better defined and more\nphysical than Turing\u2019s own way of expressing it. (Deutsch 1985:\n99)\n\n\nThis thesis is certainly \u201cmore physical\u201d than\nTuring\u2019s thesis. It is, however, a completely different\nclaim from Turing\u2019s own, so it is potentially confusing to\npresent it as a \u201cbetter defined\u201d version of what Turing\nsaid. As already emphasized, Turing was talking about effective\nmethods, whereas the theses presented by Deutsch and Wolfram\nconcern all (finitely realizable) physical systems\u2014no matter\nwhether or not the system\u2019s activity is effective.\n\nIn the wake of this early work by Deutsch and Wolfram, the phrases\n\u201cphysical form of the Church-Turing thesis\u201d,\n\u201cphysical version of the Church-Turing thesis\u201d\u2014and\neven \u201cthe physical Church-Turing\nthesis\u201d\u2014are now quite common in the current literature.\nHowever, such terms are probably better avoided, since these physical\ntheses are very distant from Turing\u2019s thesis and Church\u2019s\nthesis.\n\nIn his 1985 paper, Deutsch went on to point out that if the\ndescription \u201ca universal model computing machine operating by\nfinite means\u201d is replaced in his physical thesis by \u201ca\nuniversal Turing machine\u201d, then the result:\n\n\nEvery finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated\nby a universal Turing machine\n\n\nis not true. His reason for saying so is the point discussed at the\nend of\n Section 6.3,\n concerning non-discrete physical systems. Deutsch argued that a\nuniversal Turing machine \u201ccannot perfectly simulate any\nclassical dynamical system\u201d, since \u201c[o]wing to the\ncontinuity of classical dynamics, the possible states of a classical\nsystem necessarily form a continuum\u201d, whereas the universal\nTuring machine is a discrete system (Deutsch 1985: 100). Deutsch then\nwent on to introduce the important concept of a universal quantum\ncomputer, saying (but without proof) that this is \u201ccapable of\nperfectly simulating every finite, realizable physical system\u201d\n(1985: 102).\n\nThe following formulation differs in its details from both\nWolfram\u2019s and Deutsch\u2019s theses, but arguably captures the\nspirit of both. In view of the Deutsch-Gandy point about continuous\nsystems, the idea of perfect simulation is replaced by the concept of\nsimulation to any desired degree of accuracy:\n\n\nDeutsch-Wolfram Thesis:\n\nEvery finite physical system can be simulated to any specified degree\nof accuracy by a universal Turing machine. (Copeland & Shagrir\n2019)\n\n\nRelated physical theses were advanced by Earman 1986, Pour-El and\nRichards 1989, Pitowsky 1990, Blum et al. 1998, and others. The\nDeutsch-Wolfram thesis is closely related to Gandy\u2019s Thesis M,\nand to the weak maximality thesis\n (Section 5.4).\n In fact the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis entails the latter (but not vice\nversa, since the maximality thesis concerns only machines,\nwhereas the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis concerns the behavior of\nall finite physical systems\u2014although any who think that\nevery finite physical system is a computing machine will disagree; see\ne.g., Pitowsky 1990).\n\nIs the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis true? This is an open question (Copeland\n& Shagrir 2020)\u2014so too for the weak maximality thesis. One\nfocus of debate is whether physical randomness, if it exists,\nfalsifies these theses (Calude et al. 2010; Calude & Svozil 2008;\nCopeland 2000). But even in the case of non-random systems,\nspeculation stretches back over at least six decades that there may be\nreal physical processes (and so, potentially, machine-operations)\nwhose behavior is neither computable nor approximable by a universal\nTuring machine. See, for example, Scarpellini 1963, Pour-El and\nRichards 1979, 1981, Kreisel 1967, 1974, 1982, Geroch and Hartle 1986,\nPitowsky 1990, Stannett 1990, da Costa and Doria 1991, 1994, Hogarth\n1994, Siegelmann and Sontag 1994, Copeland and Sylvan 1999, Kieu 2004,\n2006 (see Other Internet Resources), Penrose 1994, 2011, 2016.\n\nTo select, by way of example, just one paper from this list: Pour-El\nand Richards showed in their 1981 article that a system evolving from\ncomputable initial conditions in accordance with the familiar\nthree-dimensional wave equation is capable of exhibiting behavior that\nfalsifies the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis. However, now as then, it is an\nopen question whether these initial conditions are physically\npossible.\n6.4.2 The \u201cGandy argument\u201d\n\nGandy (1980) gave a profound discussion of whether there could be\ndeterministic, discrete systems whose behavior cannot be calculated by\na universal Turing machine. The now famous \u201cGandy\nargument\u201d aims to show that, given certain reasonable physical\nassumptions, the behavior of every discrete deterministic\nmechanism is calculable by Turing machine. In some respects, the Gandy\nargument resembles and extends Turing\u2019s argument I, and Gandy\nregarded it as an improved and more general alternative to\nTuring\u2019s I (1980: 145). He emphasized that (unlike\nTuring\u2019s argument), his argument takes \u201cparallel working\ninto account\u201d (1980: 124\u20135); and it is this that accounts\nfor much of the additional complexity of Gandy\u2019s analysis as\ncompared to Turing\u2019s.\n\nGandy viewed the conclusion of his argument (that the behavior of\nevery discrete deterministic mechanism is calculable by Turing\nmachine) as relatively a priori, provable on the basis of a\nset-theoretic derivation that makes very general physical assumptions\n(namely, the four axioms mentioned in\n Section 3.4).\n These assumptions include, for instance, a lower bound on the\ndimensions of a mechanism\u2019s components, and an upper bound on\nthe speed of propagation of effects and signals. (The argument aims to\ncover only mechanisms obeying the principles of Relativity.) Gandy\nexpressed his various physical assumptions set-theoretically, by means\nof precise axioms, which he called Principles I \u2013 IV. Principle\nIII, for example, captures the idea that there is a bound on the\nnumber of types of basic parts (atoms) from which the states of the\nmachine are uniquely assembled; and Principle IV\u2014which Gandy\ncalled the \u201cprinciple of local causation\u201d\u2014captures\nthe idea that each state-transition must be determined by the\nlocal environments of the parts of the mechanism that change\nin the transition.\n\nGandy was very clear that his argument does not apply to continuous\nsystems\u2014analogue machines, as he called them\u2014and\nnon-relativistic systems. (Extracts from unpublished work by Gandy, in\nwhich he attempted to develop a companion argument for analogue\nmachines, are included in Copeland & Shagrir 2007.) However, the\nscope of the Gandy argument is also limited in other ways, not noted\nby Gandy himself. For example, some asynchronous algorithms fall\noutside the scope of Gandy\u2019s principles (Gurevich 2012; Copeland\n& Shagrir 2007). Gurevich concludes that Gandy has not shown\n\u201cthat his axioms are satisfied by all discrete mechanical\ndevices\u201d, and Shagrir says there is no \u201cbasis for claiming\nthat Gandy characterized finite machine computation\u201d (Gurevich\n2012: 36, Shagrir 2002: 234). It will be useful to give some examples\nof discrete deterministic systems that, in one way or another, evade\nGandy\u2019s conclusion that the behavior of every such system is\ncalculable by Turing machine.\n\nFirst, it is relatively trivial that mechanisms satisfying\nGandy\u2019s four principles may nevertheless produce uncomputable\noutput from computable input if embedded in a universe whose physical\nlaws have Turing-uncomputability built into them, e.g., via a temporal\nvariable (Copeland & Shagrir 2007). Moreover, some asynchronous\nalgorithms fall outside the scope of Gandy\u2019s principles\n(Gurevich 2012; Copeland & Shagrir 2007). Second, certain\n(notional) discrete deterministic \u201crelativistic computers\u201d\nalso fall outside the scope of Gandy\u2019s principles. Relativistic\ncomputers were described in a 1987 lecture by Pitowsky (Pitowsky\n1990), and in Hogarth 1994 and Etesi & N\u00e9meti 2002. The\nidea is outlined in the entry on\n computation in physical systems;\n for further discussion see Shagrir and Pitowsky 2003, Copeland and\nShagrir 2020.\n\nThe N\u00e9meti relativistic computer makes use of gravitational\ntime-dilation effects in order to compute (in a broad sense) a\nfunction that provably cannot be computed by a universal Turing\nmachine (e.g., the halting function). N\u00e9meti and his colleagues\nemphasize that the N\u00e9meti computer is \u201cnot in conflict\nwith presently accepted scientific principles\u201d and that, in\nparticular, \u201cthe principles of quantum mechanics are not\nviolated\u201d. They suggest moreover that humans might \u201ceven\nbuild\u201d a relativistic computer \u201csometime in the\nfuture\u201d (Andr\u00e9ka, N\u00e9meti, & N\u00e9meti\n2009: 501).\n\nAccording to Gandy,\n\n\u201cA discrete deterministic mechanical device satisfies\nprinciples I-IV\u201d (he called this \u201cThesis P\u201d; Gandy\n1980: 126), and\n\u201cWhat can be calculated by a device satisfying principles\nI-IV is computable\u201d (he labelled this\n\u201cTheorem\u201d).\n\n\n1 and 2 together yield: What can be calculated by a discrete\ndeterministic mechanical device is (Turing-machine)\ncomputable.\n\nHowever, the N\u00e9meti computer is a discrete, deterministic\nmechanical device, and yet is able to calculate functions that are not\nTuring-machine computable. That is to say, relativistic computers are\ncounterexamples to Gandy\u2019s Thesis P. In brief, the reason for\nthis is that the sense of \u201cdeterministic\u201d implicitly\nspecified in Gandy\u2019s Principles\n(\u201cGandy-deterministic\u201d) is narrower than the intuitive\nsense of \u201cdeterministic\u201d, where a deterministic system is\none obeying laws that involve no randomness or stochasticity.\nRelativistic computers are deterministic but not Gandy-deterministic.\n(For a fuller discussion, see Copeland, Shagrir, & Sprevak\n2018.)\n\nIn conclusion, Gandy\u2019s analysis has made a considerable\ncontribution to the current understanding of machine computation. But,\nimportant and illuminating though the Gandy argument is, it certainly\ndoes not settle the question whether the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis is\ntrue.\n6.4.3 Quantum effects and the \u201cTotal\u201d thesis\n\nThere is a stronger form of the\n Deutsch-Wolfram thesis,\n dubbed the \u201cTotal thesis\u201d in Copeland and Shagrir\n2019.\n\n\nThe Total Thesis:\n\nEvery physical aspect of the behavior of any physical system can be\ncalculated (to any specified degree of accuracy) by a universal Turing\nmachine.\n\n\nLogically, the Total thesis is counter-exampled by the universal\nTuring machine itself (assuming that the universal machine, with its\nindefinitely long tape, is at least a notional physical system; see\nCopeland & Shagrir 2020 for discussion of this assumption). This\nis because there is no algorithm for calculating whether a universal\nTuring machine halts on every given input\u2014i.e., there is no\nalgorithm for calculating that aspect of the machine\u2019s behavior.\nThe question remains, however, whether the Total thesis is infringed\nby any systems that are \u201cmore physical\u201d than the universal\nmachine. (Notice that such systems, if any exist, do not necessarily\nalso infringe the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis, since it is possible that,\neven though answers to certain physical questions about the system are\nuncomputable, the system is nevertheless able to be simulated by a\nTuring machine.)\n\nInterestingly, recent work in condensed matter quantum physics\nindicates that\u2014possibly\u2014quantum many-body systems could\ninfringe the Total thesis. In 2012, Eisert, M\u00fcller and Gogolin\nestablished the surprising result that\n\n\nthe very natural physical problem of determining whether certain\noutcome sequences cannot occur in repeated quantum measurements is\nundecidable, even though the same problem for classical measurements\nis readily decidable. (Eisert, M\u00fcller & Gogolin 2012:\n260501.1)\n\n\nThis was a curtain-raiser to a series of dramatic results about the\nuncomputability of quantum phase transitions, by Cubitt and his group\n(Cubitt, Perez-Garcia, & Wolf 2015; Bausch, Cubitt, Lucia, &\nPerez-Garcia 2020; Bausch, Cubitt, & Watson 2021). These results\nconcern the \u201cspectral gap\u201d, an important determinant of\nthe properties of a substance. A quantum many-body system is said to\nbe \u201cgapped\u201d if the system has a well-defined next least\nenergy-level above the system\u2019s ground energy-level, and is said\nto be \u201cgapless\u201d otherwise (i.e., if the energy spectrum is\ncontinuous). The \u201cspectral gap problem\u201d is the problem of\ndetermining whether a given many-body system is gapped or gapless.\n\nThe uncomputability results of Cubitt et al. stem from their discovery\nthat the halting problem can be encoded in the spectral gap problem.\nDeciding whether a model system of the type they have studied is\ngapped or gapless, given a description of the local interactions, is\n\u201cat least as hard as solving the Halting Problem\u201d (Bausch,\nCubitt, & Watson 2021: 2). Moreover, this is not just a case of\nuncomputability in, uncomputability out. Uncomputability\narises even though the initial conditions are computable (as with the\nnotional system described in Pour-El and Richards 1981, mentioned in\n Section 6.4.1).\n Cubitt et al. emphasize:\n\n\nthe phase diagram is uncomputable even for computable (or\neven algebraic) values of its parameter \\(\\phi\\). Indeed, it is\nuncomputable at a countably-infinite set of computable (or algebraic)\nvalues of \\(\\phi\\). (Bausch, Cubitt, & Watson 2019: 8)\n\n\nHowever, Cubitt admits that the models used in the proofs are somewhat\nartificial:\n\n\nWhether the results can be extended to more natural models is yet to\nbe determined. (Cubitt, Perez-Garcia & Wolf 2015: 211)\n\n\nIn short, it is an open\u2014and fascinating\u2014question whether\nthere are realistic physical systems that fail to satisfy the Total\nthesis.\n7. Some Key Remarks by Turing and Church\n7.1 Turing machines\n\nTuring prefaced his first description of a Turing machine with the\nwords:\n\n\nWe may compare a man in the process of computing a \u2026 number to\na machine. (Turing 1936 [2004: 59])\n\n\nThe Turing machine is a model, idealized in certain respects, of a\nhuman being calculating in accordance with an effective\nmethod.\n\nWittgenstein put this point in a striking way:\n\n\nTuring\u2019s \u201cMachines\u201d. These machines are\nhumans who calculate. (Wittgenstein 1947 [1980: 1096])\n\n\nIt is a point that Turing was to emphasize, in various forms, again\nand again. For example:\n\n\nA man provided with paper, pencil, and rubber, and subject to strict\ndiscipline, is in effect a universal machine. (Turing 1948 [2004:\n416])\n\n\nIn order to understand Turing\u2019s \u201cOn Computable\nNumbers\u201d and later texts, it is essential to keep in mind that\nwhen he used the words \u201ccomputer\u201d,\n\u201ccomputable\u201d and \u201ccomputation\u201d, he employed\nthem not in their modern sense as pertaining to machines, but as\npertaining to human calculators. For example:\n\n\nComputers always spend just as long in writing numbers down and\ndeciding what to do next as they do in actual multiplications, and it\nis just the same with ACE [the Automatic Computing Engine] \u2026\n[T]he ACE will do the work of about 10,000 computers \u2026\nComputers will still be employed on small calculations \u2026\n(Turing 1947 [2004: 387, 391])\n\n\nTuring\u2019s ACE, an early electronic stored-program digital\ncomputer, was built at the National Physical Laboratory, London; a\npilot version\u2014at the time the fastest functioning computer in\nthe world\u2014first ran in 1950, and a commercial model, the DEUCE,\nwas marketed very successfully by English Electric.\n7.2 Human computation and machine computation\n\nThe electronic stored-program digital computers for which the\nuniversal Turing machine was a blueprint are, each of them,\ncomputationally equivalent to a Turing machine, and so they too are,\nin a sense, models of human beings engaged in computation. Turing\nchose to emphasize this when explaining these electronic machines in a\nmanner suitable for an audience of uninitiates:\n\n\nThe idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that\nthese machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be\ndone by a human computer. (Turing 1950a [2004: 444])\n\n\nHe made the point a little more precisely in the technical document\ncontaining his design for the ACE:\n\n\nThe class of problems capable of solution by the machine [the ACE] can\nbe defined fairly specifically. They are [a subset of] those problems\nwhich can be solved by human clerical labour, working to fixed rules,\nand without understanding. (Turing 1945 [2005: 386])\n\n\nTuring went on to characterize this subset in terms of the\namount of paper and time available to the human clerk.\n\nIt was presumably because he considered the point to be essential for\nunderstanding the nature of the new electronic machines that he chose\nto begin his Programmers\u2019 Handbook for Manchester Electronic\nComputer Mark II with this explanation:\n\n\nElectronic computers are intended to carry out any definite rule of\nthumb process which could have been done by a human operator working\nin a disciplined but unintelligent manner. (Turing c1950:\n1)\n\n\nIt was not some deficiency of imagination that led Turing to model his\nL.C.M.s on what could be achieved by a human computer. The\npurpose for which he invented the Turing machine demanded it. The\nEntscheidungsproblem is the problem of finding a humanly\nexecutable method of a certain sort, and, as was explained\nearlier, Turing\u2019s aim was to show that there is no such method\nin the case of the full first-order predicate calculus.\n7.3 Church and the human computer\n\nTuring placed the human computer center stage in his 1936 paper. Not\nso Church. Church did not mention computation or human computers\nexplicitly in either of his two groundbreaking papers on the\nEntscheidungsproblem (Church 1936a,b). He spoke of \u201ceffective\ncalculability\u201d, taking it for granted his readers would\nunderstand this term to be referring to human calculation. He\nalso used the term \u201ceffective method\u201d, again taking it for\ngranted that readers would understand him to be speaking of a humanly\nexecutable method.\n\nChurch also used the term \u201calgorithm\u201d, saying\n\n\nIt is clear that for any recursive function of positive integers there\nexists an algorithm using which any required particular value of the\nfunction can be effectively calculated. (Church 1936a: 351)\n\n\nHe said further that the notion of effective calculability could be\nspelled out as follows:\n\n\nby defining a function to be effectively calculable if there exists an\nalgorithm for the calculation of its values. (Church 1936a: 358)\n\n\nIt was in Church\u2019s review of Turing\u2019s 1936 paper that he\nbrought the human computer out of the shadows. He wrote:\n\n\n[A] human calculator, provided with pencil and paper and explicit\ninstructions, can be regarded as a kind of Turing machine. It is thus\nimmediately clear that computability, so defined [i.e., computability\nby a Turing machine], can be identified with (especially, is no less\ngeneral than) the notion of effectiveness as it appears in certain\nmathematical problems \u2026 and in general any problem which\nconcerns the discovery of an algorithm. (Church 1937a: 43)\n\n7.4 Turing\u2019s use of \u201cmachine\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that, when Turing used the word\n\u201cmachine\u201d, he often meant not machine-in-general but, as\nwe would now say, Turing machine. At one point he explicitly drew\nattention to this usage:\n\n\nThe expression \u201cmachine process\u201d of course means one which\ncould be carried out by the type of machine I was considering [in\n\u201cOn Computable Numbers\u201d]. (Turing 1947 [2004:\n378\u20139])\n\n\nThus when, a few pages later, Turing asserted that \u201cmachine\nprocesses and rule of thumb processes are synonymous\u201d (1947\n[2004: 383]), he is to be understood as advancing the Church-Turing\nthesis (and its converse), not a version of the maximality thesis.\nUnless his intended usage is borne in mind, misunderstanding could\nensue. Especially liable to mislead are statements like the following,\nwhich a casual reader might mistake for a formulation of the\nmaximality thesis:\n\n\nThe importance of the universal machine is clear. We do not need to\nhave an infinity of different machines doing different jobs. A single\none will suffice. The engineering problem of producing various\nmachines for various jobs is replaced by the office work of\n\u201cprogramming\u201d the universal machine to do these jobs.\n(Turing 1948 [2004: 414])\n\n\nIn context it is perfectly clear that these remarks concern machines\nequivalent to Turing machines; the passage is embedded in a discussion\nof L.C.M.s.\n\nWhether or not Turing would, if queried, have assented to the weak\nmaximality thesis is unknown. There is certainly no textual evidence\nin favor of the view that he did so assent. The same is true of the\n Deutsch-Wolfram thesis\n and its cognates: there is no textual evidence that Turing would have\nassented to any such thesis.\n7.5 Church\u2019s version of Turing\u2019s thesis\n\nInterestingly, the summary of Turing\u2019s account of computability\ngiven by Church in his 1937 review was not entirely correct. Church\nsaid:\n\n\nThe author [Turing] proposes as a criterion that an infinite sequence\nof digits 0 and 1 be \u201ccomputable\u201d that it shall be\npossible to devise a computing machine, occupying a finite space and\nwith working parts of a finite size, which will write down the\nsequence to any desired number of terms if allowed to run for a\nsufficiently long time. (Church 1937a: 42)\n\n\nHowever, there was no requirement proposed in Turing\u2019s 1936\npaper that Turing machines occupy \u201ca finite space\u201d or have\n\u201cworking parts of a finite size\u201d. Nor did Turing couch\nmatters in terms of the machine\u2019s writing down \u201cany\ndesired number of terms\u201d of the sequence, \u201cif allowed to\nrun for a sufficiently long time\u201d. Turing said, on the contrary,\nthat a sequence is \u201ccomputable if it can be computed by a\ncircle-free machine\u201d (Turing 1936 [2004: 61]); where a machine\nis circle-free if it is not one that\n\n\nnever writes down more than a finite number of symbols [0s and 1s].\n(Turing 1936 [2004: 60])\n\n\nIn consequence, Church\u2019s version of Turing\u2019s thesis is\nsubtly different from Turing\u2019s own:\n\n\nChurch\u2019s Turing\u2019s thesis:\n\nAn infinite sequence of digits is \u201ccomputable\u201d if (and\nonly if) it is possible to devise a computing machine, occupying a\nfinite space and with working parts of a finite size, that will write\ndown the sequence to any desired number of terms if allowed to run for\na sufficiently long time.\n\n\nIn so far as Church includes these three finiteness requirements\n(i.e., that the machine occupy a finite space, have finite-sized\nparts, and produce finite numbers of digits), his version of\nTuring\u2019s thesis can perhaps be said to be \u201cmore\nphysical\u201d than any of Turing\u2019s formulations of the thesis.\nChurch\u2019s finiteness requirements are in some respects\nreminiscent of Gandy\u2019s idea that the states of a discrete\ndeterministic calculating machine must be built up iteratively from a\nbounded number of types of basic components, the dimensions of which\nhave a lower bound (see\n Section 6.4.2).\n Although, as explained there, Gandy imposes further requirements on a\ndiscrete deterministic calculating machine, and these go far beyond\nChurch\u2019s finiteness requirements.\n\nNotwithstanding Church\u2019s efforts to inject additional physical\nrealism into the concept of a Turing machine, it is\u2014as in\nTuring\u2019s case\u2014unknown whether Church would, if queried,\nhave assented to the\n Deutsch-Wolfram thesis\n or any cognate thesis. There seems to be no textual evidence either\nway. Church was simply silent about such matters.",
