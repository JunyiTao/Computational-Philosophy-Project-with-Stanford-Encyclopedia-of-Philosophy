Historical Overview\n\nAlthough in Western philosophy the earliest formulation of a version\nof the cosmological argument is found in Plato\u2019s Laws,\n893\u201396, the classical argument is firmly rooted in\nAristotle\u2019s Physics (VIII, 4\u20136) and\nMetaphysics (XII, 1\u20136). Islamic philosophy enriches the\ntradition, developing two types of arguments. Arabic philosophers\n(falasifa), such as Ibn Sina (c. 980\u20131037), developed\nthe argument from contingency, which was taken up by Thomas Aquinas\n(1225\u201374) in his Summa Theologica (I,q.2,a.3) and in\nhis Summa Contra Gentiles (I, 13). Influenced by the\nNeoplatonist John Philoponus (5th c) (Davidson 1969), the\nmutakallim\u016bm\u2014theologians who used reason and\nargumentation to support their revealed Islamic\nbeliefs\u2014developed the temporal version of the argument from the\nimpossibility of an infinite regress, now referred to as the\nkal\u0101m cosmological argument. For example,\nal-Gh\u0101z\u0101li (1058\u20131111) argued that everything that\nbegins to exist requires a cause of its beginning. The world is\ncomposed of temporal phenomena preceded by other temporally-ordered\nphenomena. Since such a series of temporal phenomena cannot continue\nto infinity because an actual infinite is impossible, the world must\nhave had a beginning and a cause of its existence, termed Allah or God\n(Craig 1979: part 1). This version of the cosmological argument\nentered the medieval Christian tradition through Bonaventure\n(1221\u201374) in his Sentences (II Sent.\nD.1,p.1,a.1,q.2).\n\nEnlightenment thinkers, such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Samuel\nClarke, reaffirmed the cosmological argument. Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716) appealed to a strengthened principle of sufficient\nreason, according to which \u201cno fact can be real or existing and\nno statement true without a sufficient reason for its being so and not\notherwise\u201d (Monadology, \u00a732). Leibniz uses the\nprinciple to argue that the sufficient reason for the \u201cseries of\nthings comprehended in the universe of creatures\u201d (\u00a736)\nmust exist outside this series of contingencies and is found in a\nnecessary being that we call God (\u00a738). Samuel Clarke likewise\nemployed the principle of sufficient reason in his cosmological\nargument (Rowe 1975: chap. 2).\n\nAlthough the cosmological argument does not figure prominently in\nAsian philosophy, a very abbreviated version of it, proceeding from\ndependence, can be found in Udayana\u2019s\nNy\u0101yakusum\u0101\u00f1jali I,4. In general,\nphilosophers in the Ny\u0101ya tradition argue that since the universe\nhas parts that come into existence at one occasion and not another, it\nmust have a cause. We could admit an infinite regress of causes if we\nhad evidence for such, but lacking such evidence, God must exist as\nthe non-dependent cause. Many of the objections to the argument\ncontend that God is an inappropriate cause because of God\u2019s\nnature. For example, since God is immobile and has no body, he cannot\nproperly be said to cause anything. The Naiy\u0101yikas reply that God\ncould assume a body at certain times, and in any case, God need not\ncreate in the same way humans do (Potter 1977: 100\u201307).\n\nRen\u00e9 Descartes advances his version of the cosmological\nargument not only as a piece of natural theology that proves\nGod\u2019s existence by natural reason, but also serving an epistemic\nfunction of guaranteeing that God could not be deceiving him\n(Meditations on First Philosophy, Preface & Meditation\n3). The cosmological argument came under serious assault in the\n18th century, first by David Hume and then by Immanuel Kant.\nHume (1748) attacked both the view of causation presupposed in the\nargument (that causation is an objective, productive, necessary power\nrelation that holds between two things) and the Causal\nPrinciple\u2014every contingent being has a cause of its\nexistence\u2014that lies at the heart of the argument. Kant contended\nthat the cosmological argument, in identifying the necessary being,\nrelies on the ontological argument, which in turn is suspect. We will\nreturn to these criticisms below.\n\nIn the first part of the 20th century, with the rise of Positivism,\nthe argument was largely abandoned. For critics like J.J.C. Smart\n(1955), the claim of the cosmological argument that God necessarily\nexists is equivalent to \u201cNecessarily, God exists.\u201d But\nsince existence claims cannot be logically necessary, the statement is\nabsurd. However, he notes, within us lies a deep-seated question: why\nshould anything exist at all? Smart does not know what sort of\nquestion this is for it fails to fit his conception of propositions as\neither necessary truths or empirical claims. However, he continues,\nthis awe-inspiring theological question appeals to those with a\nreligious attitude. In this, the cosmological argument is reduced to a\nmystical role, catering to our emotions but devoid of rational\ncontent.\n\nBoth theists and nontheists in the last part of the 20th\ncentury and the first part of the 21st century generally\nshow a healthy skepticism about the argument. Alvin Plantinga\nconcludes \u201cthat this piece of natural theology is\nineffective\u201d (1967: chap. 1), and from his later Reformed\nEpistemology, it is unnecessary since belief in God can be properly\nbasic. Richard Gale contends, in Kantian fashion, that since the\nconclusion of all versions of the cosmological argument invokes an\nimpossibility, no cosmological arguments can provide examples of sound\nreasoning (1991: chap. 7). (However, Gale seems to have changed his\nmind and in recent writings proposed and defended his own version of\nthe cosmological argument, which we will consider below.) Similarly,\nMichael Martin (1990: chap. 4), John Mackie (1982: chap. 5), Quentin\nSmith (Craig and Smith 1993), Bede Rundle (2004), Wes Morriston (2000,\n2002a, 2003, 2010), and Graham Oppy (2006: chap. 3), among numerous\nothers, reason that no current version of the cosmological argument is\nsound or provides probabilistic evidence. Yet dissenting voices can be\nheard. Robert Koons (1997) employs mereology and modal and\nnonmonotonic logic in taking a \u201cnew look\u201d at the argument\nfrom contingency. In his widely discussed writings William Lane Craig\nmarshals multidisciplinary evidence for the truth of the premises\nfound in the kal\u0101m argument. Richard Gale and Alexander\nPruss propose a version based on a so-called weak principle of\nsufficient reason that leads to a finite God that is not\nomnibenevolent, while Michael Almeida constructs a version of the\nargument based on modal realism and a strong principle of sufficient\nreason. Richard Swinburne, though rejecting deductive versions of the\ncosmological argument, proposes an inductive argument that is part of\na larger cumulative case for God\u2019s existence. \n\n\nThere is quite a chance that if there is a God he will make something\nof the finitude and complexity of a universe. It is very unlikely that\na universe would exist uncaused, but rather more likely that God would\nexist uncaused. The existence of the universe\u2026can be made\ncomprehensible if we suppose that it is brought about by God.\n(Swinburne 1979: 131\u201332) \n\n\nIn short, in contrast to the first half of the last century,\ncontemporary philosophers contribute increasingly detailed, complex,\nand sophisticated arguments on both sides of the debate, some\nconnected to natural theology, many others unconnected but important\nfor their philosophically complex and subtle reasoning.\n",
