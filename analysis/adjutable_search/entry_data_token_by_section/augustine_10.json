    "main_text": "Ethics || Virtue\n7.2 Virtue\n\nIn principle Augustine follows the view of the ancient eudaimonists\nthat virtue is sufficient or at least relevant for happiness. There\nare however several important modifications. (1) The entire structure\nis made dependent on God\u2019s prevenient grace. True virtue\nguarantees true happiness, but there is no true virtue that is not a\ngift of grace.\n (2) Augustine accepts Cicero\u2019s definition of virtue as the art\nof \u201cliving well\u201d but emphatically rejects his equation of\nliving well and living happily, i.e., the Stoicizing claim that a\nvirtuous disposition is equivalent to happiness (De libero\narbitrio 2.50; De civitate dei 4.21; De moribus\n1.10; contrast Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 5.53). Our\npostlapsarian life on earth is inevitably the locus of sin and\npunishment, and even the saints are unable to overcome the permanent\ninner conflict between \u201cthe spirit\u201d and \u201cthe\nflesh\u201d, i.e., between good and evil volitions or rational and\nirrational desires in this life (De civitate dei 19.4,\nquoting Galatians 5:17). The perfect inner tranquility virtue strives\nfor will only be achieved in the afterlife. (3) Augustine replaces the\nancient definition of virtue as \u201cright reason\u201d (as in\nStoicism) or \u201cactivity in accordance with reason\u201d (as in\nthe Aristotelian tradition) with a definition of virtue as love of God\nor, in later texts, as love of God and neighbor. Virtue is an inner\ndisposition or motivational habit that enables us to perform every\naction we perform out of right love.\n There are several catalogues of the traditional four cardinal virtues\nprudence, justice, courage and temperance that redefine these as\nvarieties of the love of God either in this life or in the eschaton\n(De moribus 1.25; Letter 155.12; cf. Letter\n155.16 for the cardinal virtues as varieties of love of the neighbor;\nDe libero arbitrio 1.27 for descriptions of the virtues in\nterms of good will). His briefest definition of virtue is\n\u201cordered love\u201d (De civitate dei 15.22). This does\nnot mean that virtue becomes non-rational (for Augustine love and will\nare essential features of the rational mind; see\n 6.2 The Human Mind as an Image of God),\n but it does mean that it becomes essentially intentional. The\ncriterion of true virtue is that it is oriented toward God. Even if\nAugustine occasionally talks as if the four cardinal virtues could be\nadded to the Pauline or theological virtues of love, faith and hope to\nmake a sum of seven (Letter 171A.2), they are best taken as a\nsubdivision of love, the only one of the Pauline virtues that persists\nin the eschaton (Soliloquia 1.14).\n\nThese modifications have several interesting consequences. Even though\nAugustine postpones the happiness that is the reward of virtue to the\nafterlife, he does not make virtue a means to an end in the sense that\nvirtue becomes superfluous when happiness is reached. To the contrary,\nhe insists that virtue will persist in the eschaton where it will be\ntransformed into eternal unimpeded fruition of God and of the neighbor\nin God. Then it will indeed be its own reward and identical with\nhappiness (Letter 155.2; 12). Both eschatological virtue and\nvirtue in this life are thus love of God; they only differ in that the\nlatter is subject to hindrances and temptation. For this reason, those\nwho have true love of God\u2014e.g., Christian martyrs\u2014are\nhappy already in this life, at least in hope (e.g.,\nConfessiones 10.29; Tornau 2015). Augustine\u2019s\ndescription of eschatological and non-eschatological virtues\n(Letter 155) is partly modelled on the Neoplatonic doctrine\nof the scale of virtues with its ascending hierarchy of social or\ncivic, purificatory and contemplative virtues (Tornau 2013; Dodaro\n2004a: 206\u2013212; Dodaro 2004b). When analyzing virtue in this\nlife, Augustine takes up the Stoic distinction, familiar to him from\nCicero (De officiis 1.7\u20138), between a virtue\u2019s\nfinal end (finis) and its appropriate action\n(officium; cf., e.g., Contra Iulianum 4.21; De\ncivitate dei 10.18). The appropriate action that characterizes\nvirtue in this life but is no longer needed in eternal bliss is to\nsubdue the lower parts of soul to reason and to resist the temptations\nthat emerge from the permanent conflict between good and bad volitions\n(as it were, a permanent \u201cakratic\u201d state; see\n 7.4 Will and Freedom)\n that results from our fallen condition (De civitate dei\n19.4). As the examples of the best philosophers and the heroes of\nRome\u2019s glorious past teach, whom Augustine regularly accuses of\nlove of glory, these actions may easily spring from other motivations\nthan the true love of God. Augustine therefore distinguishes between\ntrue (i.e., Christian) virtue that is motivated by love of God and\n\u201cvirtue as such\u201d (virtus ipsa: De civitate dei\n5.19) that performs the same appropriate actions but is, in the last\nresort, guided by self-love or pride (ib. 5.12; 19.25). Among other\nthings, this distinction underpins his solution of the so-called\nproblem of pagan virtue (Harding 2008; Tornau 2006b; Dodaro 2004a: 27\u201371; Rist 1994:\n168\u2013173) because it permits ascribing virtue in a meaningful\nsense to pagan and pre-Christian paradigms of virtue like Socrates\nwithout having to admit that they were eligible for salvation. If a\n\u201cteleological\u201d perspective on virtue is adopted that\nexclusively focuses on ends, the virtues of the pagan must be judged\nvices rather than virtues and will be punished accordingly (De\ncivitate dei 19.25, the passage from which the non-Augustinian\nphrase that pagan virtues are \u201csplendid vices\u201d seems to be\nderived; see Irwin 1999). An \u201coperative\u201d perspective\nhowever reveals that as far as appropriate actions are concerned,\nvirtuous non-Christians differ from the foolish and wicked but are\nindistinguishable from virtuous Christians. From this point of view,\nSocrates is closer to Paul than to Nero, even though his virtue will\nnot bring him happiness, i.e., eternal bliss. That he envisages a\nperspective on virtue that abstracts from the causal nexus of virtue\nand happiness is perhaps Augustine\u2019s most significant departure\nfrom ancient eudaimonism.\n",
