    "main_text": "Metaphysics: Leibnizian Idealism || Perspective and Divine Emanation\n5.3 Perspective and Divine Emanation\n\n\nStill Leibniz's version of idealism tends to produce confusion\nprecisely because of these two strands: the commitment to the\n\u201cembodiment\u201d of monads along with the rejection of the\nreality of bodies; the view that monads are not spatial but have a\npoint of view. Leibniz's point, however, is that, while monads\nare not extended, they do have a situation insofar as they bear an\nordered relation to other bodies through the body in which they are\npresent or through the body to which they represent themselves as being\nattached. (G II 253/AG 178) In other words, in the Leibnizian\nmonadology, simple substances are mind-like entities that do not,\nstrictly speaking, exist in space but that represent the universe from\na unique perspective.\n\n\nLeibniz's conception of such a perspectival universe has,\nhowever, a distinctively Platonist origin. Again, each mind-like simple\nsubstance represents itself as having a body and a position relative to\nother bodies, but in doing so each simple substance offers a\nperspective on the world for the divine mind. This idea comes out very\nclearly in the Discourse on Metaphysics \u00a714, where\nLeibniz writes the following:\n\n\nNow, first of all, it is very evident that created substances depend\nupon God, who preserves them and who even produces them continually by\na kind of emanation, just as we produce our thoughts. For God, so to\nspeak, turns on all sides and in all ways the general system of\nphenomena which he finds it good to produce in order to manifest his\nglory, and he views all the faces of the world in all ways possible,\nsince there is no relation that escapes his omniscience. The result of\neach view of the universe, as seen from a certain position, is a\nsubstance which expresses the universe in conformity with this view,\nshould God see fit to render his thought actual and to produce this\nsubstance. (A VI iv 1549\u201350/AG 46\u201347)\n\n\nThis is a striking passage. Leibniz is telling us that each finite\nsubstance is the result of a different perspective that God can take of\nthe universe and that each created substance is an emanation of God.\nThe argument here can be expressed in several different ways. First,\nsince God could occupy any and all points of view of the\nuniverse, there must be a simple substance to represent the world from\nthat perspective. (And since the simple substance must have\nrepresentations of its unique perspective, it must be a mind-like\nsubstance, a monad, capable of having perceptions.) Second, and\nstronger, God's omniscience entails knowledge of the world from\nevery perspective simultaneously, and the infinite perspectives of the\nworld originating from God's nature simply are\nmonads.\n",
