    "main_text": "The Grounds of Special Obligations\n7. The Grounds of Special Obligations\n\nSo far we have examined some contrasts between special obligations and\nboth consequentialist duties and natural duties, and have also\ndiscussed two objections to special obligations, the voluntarist\nobjection and the distributive objection. In discussing responses to\nthe voluntarist objection, some accounts of the grounds of special\nobligations were considered. But there are some other important\naccounts that deserve mention. Given the number of types of special\nobligations that commonsense recognizes, presenting the various\naccounts that have been offered of their grounds would be a\nbook-length task. So the following discussion of the grounds of\nspecial obligations should not be taken as in any way exhaustive.\n\nAs indicated above, voluntarists have often tried to assimilate all\nspecial obligations to promissory or contractual obligations. Even if\nsuch an assimilation were to be successful, we would still need an\naccount of the basis of promissory obligations. Some have attempted to\nground obligations to keep promises on the fact that when one makes a\npromise, one raises expectations in the one to whom the promise has\nbeen made. The promisee, then, has a right to have her expectations\nmet, given the promisor\u2019s voluntary raising of her expectations.\nIf you voluntarily lead me to expect that you will perform a given\naction, then I am likely to make plans on the basis of that\nexpectation. You are obligated not to upset the plans that I have made\non the basis of your voluntary actions that you knew would raise my\nexpectations. This account of the basis of promissory obligations has\nbeen extended into other contexts, including those of friendship and\nthe family (see especially Hoff Sommers\u2019 account of filial\nobligations). Our friends and family members come to rely upon us to\nact in certain ways with respect to them, and their reliance is due to\nour own voluntary past actions. Thus, as with our promisees, our\nfriends and family members have a right not to be disappointed in\ntheir expectations, a right correlated with a duty on our part to meet\ntheir expectations.\n\nOne serious difficulty with this sort of grounding of special\nobligations is that it appeals to the psychological states of those to\nwhom the obligations are owed. But consider a case in which the person\nto whom a promise is made does not expect the one making the promise\nto comply (Scanlon calls this the case of the Profligate Pal). If such\nexpectations are not raised, are no obligations created? Parents often\nhave little expectation that their children will care for them when\nthey are elderly, but that does not seem sufficient to defeat the\nclaim that children do in fact have special obligations to care for\ntheir parents. The defender of the expectations account could try\nappealing to legitimate even if only hypothetical expectations at this\npoint, but we are still left wondering why I ought to meet\nexpectations that have never actually been raised.\n\nWith respect to friendship, some have defended what can be called an\n\u2018Aristotelian\u2019 account of special obligations. Jennifer\nWhiting, for example, argues that we ought to take special care of our\nfriends if they are worthy of such concern. Thus, if I have a virtuous\nfriend, I am required to care for her because her character renders\nher deserving and a suitable object of such concern. The obvious worry\nabout any such Aristotelian account is its distance from commonsense.\nAccording to the Aristotelian account, I have special obligations to\nfriends and family if they are deserving of special concern. But\ncommonsense allows that I have special obligations to friends and\nfamily members even if they are not particularly or especially\nvirtuous. It seems that I have special obligations to help my\nintimates be virtuous, even if they are not yet virtuous. The\nAristotelian view only accounts for our special obligations to those\nof our friends or loved ones who are virtuous. But what about our less\nthan virtuous intimates? The Aristotelian must either deny that we\nhave special obligations to our non-virtuous intimates or allow that\nsomething other than virtuous character grounds special obligations to\nmost of our intimates. So the Aristotelian account is either\nimplausible or radically incomplete as an account of special\nobligations.\n\nSome defenders of special obligations have tried to draw upon claims\nabout personal identity to support their views (see especially David\nBrink). If defenders of what is known as psychological reductionism\nare right, then me now is co-personal with me later as a result of the\npsychological relationship existing between me now and me later. Me\nlater bears many psychological connections (either direct or indirect)\nto me now, and those connections form a causal chain from me now to me\nlater. But these connections can also exist in the interpersonal case,\ne.g., I can share traits with my friends and this sharing of traits\nmay be due to the interaction between us. If the relation of\n\u2018identity\u2019 between me now and me later supports reasons of\nprudence, we might suppose that the similar relation in the\ninterpersonal case supports reasons of special obligation. Of course,\nthis account requires far more development. Why suppose that we do in\nfact have reasons of prudence? Why suppose that similarity of relation\ngrounds similarity of reasons? These questions need to be answered\nbefore any appeal to the metaphysics of personal identity can be used\nto ground special obligations.\n\nRichard J. Arneson raises another worry about this type of appeal to\npsychological connections to ground special obligations. As both he\nand the advocates of such accounts point out, my strongest\npsychological connections are those that I bear to myself. But if such\npsychological connections are supposed to underlie obligations to take\nspecial care of those to whom I bear such connections, then it follows\nthat my strongest special obligations are to myself, and so I am\nmorally obligated to give special weight to my own interests. Arneson\nargues that any account of \u201cspecial-ties partiality\u201d, in\norder to be acceptable, must not have the consequence that we each\nhave special obligations to be partial to ourselves. Perhaps, however,\none could meet Arneson\u2019s objection, by refusing to use the word\n\u2018obligation\u2019: we have various kinds of fundamental\nagent-relative reasons, and one of those reasons is to take special\ncare of ourselves. Couched in terms of reasons, rather than in terms\nof obligations, the latter claim does not seem at all implausible.\n\nLet\u2019s consider one last account of the grounds of special\nobligations. The difficulties with the consequentialist account of\nspecial obligations arise from its only granting instrumental\nsignificance to special relationships, i.e., special relationships\nprovide unique opportunities for promoting intrinsic value. But\ncommonsense seems to accord moral significance to special\nrelationships considered for their own sake, not in virtue of the\nopportunities that they afford. One could then argue that reasons of\nspecial obligation supervene upon relationships between friends,\nbetween promisor and promisee, etc. So there is no deeper account of\nspecial obligations: truths about reasons and the relationships upon\nwhich they supervene are self-evident. This was the intuitionist line\nadopted by W. D. Ross. Defense of this account of the grounds of\nspecial obligation requires meeting objections to an intuitionist\nmoral epistemology, which, as a version of foundationalism, is a\nfrequent target of attack in recent philosophical work.\n",
