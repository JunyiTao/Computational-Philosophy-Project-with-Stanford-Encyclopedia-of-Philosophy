    "main_text": "Organ Retrieval from the Dead || Proposals for reform\n1.2 Proposals for reform\n\nThe persistent scarcity of organs has given rise to several proposals\nto reform the system for consent. The main ones are:\n\nEncourage or mandate clearer choices by the deceased.\nEnd the family\u2019s power of veto.\nChange defaults so that organs are taken except when the deceased\nformally objected.\nConscript organs.\nPay for organs.\n\n\n(1)\u2013(4) are discussed below; for (5), see the entry on\n the sale of human organs.\n Before evaluating the proposals, we describe the claims of the main\naffected parties. In determining what the rules for retrieval ought to\nbe, three main claims are in play. These are the claims of the\ndeceased, the deceased\u2019s family, and potential recipients of\norgans. Transplant professionals have claims too, which are probably\nbest thought of as matters of professional conscience, but these are\nnot discussed further here.\n\nThe dead. The \u201cclaims of the dead over their\nbodies\u201d is almost invariably shorthand for \u201cthe claims of\nthe living over their post-mortem bodies\u201d, and that is how it\nwill be understood here. While it is widely accepted that living\npeople have strong claims over their own bodies, especially when it\ncomes to vetoing invasions of their bodily integrity, it is much less\nwidely accepted that the dead have such claims. Among the views that\nthe dead have claims, we may distinguish between those which hold that\nevents after death can harm the interests of the formerly-living and\nthose which hold that it is only the fears and concerns of the living\nthat have weight. Thus if it is asked why we should attach weight to a\nperson\u2019s refusal of organ retrieval, the first sort of view may\nsay \u201cbecause to take the organ of a person who refused damages\nhis interest\u201d and the second sort may say \u201cbecause the\nanticipation of retrieval against his wishes will be bad for the\nliving person\u201d. The first sort of view is the subject of\nposthumous interests (see the entry on\n death).\n\nEven if we accept that people may have posthumous interests, the\ncontent of those interests will often be unknown or indeterminate.\nMany people do not think about organ donation, which is quite\nreasonable given the low chance that they will die in such a way as to\npermit organ retrieval. In cases where they have not thought or not\nrevealed their thoughts, it seems plausible to say that they have no\ninterest to be taken into account in deciding whether to proceed with\nretrieval.\n\nIn some cases, the claims of the deceased will be in conflict with\nthose of their families and/or the claims of potential recipients. The\nquestion arises of how to weigh the claims of the deceased. Some\nwriters accept that the deceased can have posthumous interests, but\nbelieve them to be of little weight, particularly compared with the\nneeds for organs of those with organ failure (Harris 2002, 2003). They\nmay believe that people are not affected by their posthumous interests\nbeing set back or they may think the fear of retrieval is of little\nweight. In their view, any roughly consequentialist calculation would\njustify setting aside the objections of the deceased to organ\nretrieval. Other writers argue that if we accept posthumous interests\nand accept that people have strong claims over their bodies while\nalive, we have grounds to attribute rights to the living over their\npost-mortem bodies (T.M. Wilkinson 2011). Such a view needs to explain\nhow posthumous rights are possible, since some writers in political\nand legal theory believe that rights could not protect posthumous\ninterests for technical reasons to do with the nature of rights\n(Steiner 1994; Fabre 2008).\n\nThe family. If one accepts that the deceased have a claim,\nthen families may acquire a claim by transfer. That is, the deceased\nmay delegate decision-making power to their families, as is possible\nin some jurisdictions. Some authors have even suggested that the\norgans of the dead should be treated as something akin to inheritable\nproperty (Voo and Holm 2014). Acquiring a claim by transfer however is\nno more controversial than the deceased\u2019s having a claim in the\nfirst place. What is the subject of dispute is whether the family\nshould have a claim in their own right which could be set against the\nclaims of the deceased or potential recipients.\n\nSome argue for family decision-making on cultural grounds (Fan and\nWang 2019). For them, giving priority to the deceased is unacceptably\nindividualist either in all cases or in cases where individualism is\nculturally abnormal (Boddington 1998). Among the difficulties for such\nviews is to explain why, if individualism is mistaken, the decision\nabout retrieval should be made by individual families rather than in\nthe interests of the wider community, which may well require taking\norgans against the families\u2019 wishes so as to meet the needs of\npotential recipients.\n\nIf families were overridden, it is reasonable to suppose that they\nwould suffer extra distress: that is, even more distress than they\nwould already be experiencing upon the often untimely and\nunanticipated death of the relative. Few writers deny that avoiding\ndistress would be a good reason, although some believe (without much\nevidence) that a norm of taking organs and overriding families\u2019\nopposition would come to be accepted (Harris 2003). What is\ncontroversial is how strong a claim the family would acquire not to be\ndistressed.\n\nFinally, families are not monolithic, and sometimes they disagree\namong themselves about whether to endorse organ retrieval. How\ninternal disagreement affects the families is not widely\ndiscussed.\n\nPotential recipients. As was said at the start of this entry,\npotential recipients stand to gain a great deal from receiving an\norgan in terms of both the quantity and quality of their lives. They\nare also badly off, in a medical sense, in that they suffer from organ\nfailure. Utilitarian, prioritarian, and egalitarian views of justice\nand benevolence would, therefore, give considerable weight to the\nneeds of potential recipients.\n\nWe now turn to consider the proposals for reform listed above.\n1.2.1 Encourage or mandate clearer choices by the deceased\n\nAccording to some, an important cause of family refusal of organ\nretrieval is uncertainty about the wishes of the deceased. Families\nthat do not know what their relatives wanted often default to\n\u201cno\u201d (den Hartogh 2008a). To avoid the default, some\nwriters would encourage people to decide about donation in a way\nothers will know, for instance by paying them (De Wispelaere and\nStirton 2010) and others suggest mandating choice by, for instance,\nwithholding driving licenses from those who do not choose. The\nsuggestion is not, or not in all cases, that people be steered into\nagreeing to donate or penalized if they refuse. It is that people be\nsteered to make clear choices, yes or no.\n\nSome ethical questions are raised by penalizing people for not\nchoosing or for introducing monetary encouragement. It may be replied\nthat no one is pressured to donate, as opposed to choose; that the\npenalties or encouragement are slight; and that transplants are of\nsuch value to the needy that any ethical objections are easily\noverridden. The real difficulty is that mandated choice may not\nincrease retrieval rates by much. In some places where it has been\ntried (such as the U.S. states of Virginia and Texas), people who are\npressured to choose themselves default to \u201cno\u201d (den\nHartogh 2008a). In New Zealand, where one must choose as a condition\nof getting a driving license, the choice is often ignored by intensive\ncare doctors and families because it does not seem like a genuine\ndecision.\n1.2.2 End the family\u2019s power of veto\n\nFamilies usually have at least the de facto power to veto\nretrieval from the deceased, even those who adamantly wanted to donate\ntheir organs. Does this power not give excessive weight to the\ninterests of families as against the interests of both the deceased\nand potential recipients (Liberman 2015; Zambrano 2017)?\n\nAs it happens, it appears that families rarely override the\ndonors\u2019 known wishes. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that many\npeople would want to donate no matter how upset their families were,\nso allowing families to veto retrieval is unlikely to be against the\nall-things-considered wishes of many of the deceased.\n\nIn any case, transplant professionals have a practical reason not to\noverride the family: they fear bad publicity. One version of their\nargument is this:\n\n\nthere are already urban myths about people having their deaths\nhastened so as to make their organs available; few people understand\nbrain-death; donation would fall if families publicly claimed that\ntheir views were overridden and their relatives were not dead; thus\nending the family veto would reduce the supply of organs, not increase\nit.\n\n\nIf the practical argument is correct, it is understandable why\nfamilies have a medically-created power of veto. Moreover, it is hard\nto see that the veto is contrary to the claims of the deceased. While\nthe deceased may have a claim to block retrieval, no one has a claim\nthat other people use his or her organs. If the veto is in the\ninterests of potential recipients, doctors may refuse the offer of\norgans by the deceased without infringing on the deceased\u2019s\nclaim (T.M. Wilkinson 2007a).\n\nSome states in the U.S. have implemented \u201cfirst person\u201d\nconsent laws that mandate overriding families in cases where the\ndeceased has ticked the \u201cdonate\u201d box or its equivalent on\na form. It is unclear how far such laws are upheld. In principle, it\nmight be possible to get some data on the effect of overriding\nfamilies on the organ supply, thus testing the practical argument in\nthe previous paragraphs. Ethically, first person consent laws arguably\ndo not respect the wishes of the deceased, at least in cases where the\ndeceased donors who ticked the box did not fully grasp that their\nfamilies\u2019 wishes would be overridden.\n1.2.3 Change defaults so that organs are taken except when the deceased formally objected\n\nThis proposal favors what is variously called \u201copt-out\u201d or\n\u201cpresumed consent\u201d. A \u201chard\u201d version would\ntake organs even when the deceased\u2019s family objected (with all\nthe problems mentioned in the previous sub-section); a\n\u201csoft\u201d version would allow the family to veto retrieval.\nThe leading argument for opt-out claims that many people want to\ndonate but through inertia do not get round to opting in. In an\nopt-out system, inertia would prevent them opting out so their organs\ncould be taken and, since most people do want to donate, the deceased\nwould be more likely to get what they want and more organs would be\navailable (Thaler and Sunstein 2008).\n\nThe proposal envisages taking organs without the explicit consent of\nthe deceased. One may object that people\u2019s rights over their\nbodies establish a duty of non-interference which can be lifted only\nwith the consent of the rightholder (Kluge 2000). A different\nobjection points out that taking organs without consent would\nsometimes be against the wishes of the deceased; and while not taking\nwould be against the wishes of the deceased who had wanted to donate,\ntaking in error is a worse mistake than not taking in error, because\npeople have a right not to have their organs taken but no right to\nhave their organs taken (Veatch and Ross 2015; for criticism\nspecifically of their views see den Hartogh 2019). As against these\nviews, we must dispose of the bodies of the dead in some way, even if\nnot consented to; and we give unconsented medical treatment to the\nunconscious even though some would have opposed treatment (Gill 2004;\nT.M. Wilkinson 2011).\n\nIs it right to use the bodies of the deceased without either their\nconsent or knowing that they had wanted the use? The question is an\nimportant and difficult one. It is very important to note, however,\nthat this question is raised by virtually all existing organ\nprocurement systems To restate: all systems allow organs to be\ntaken without the deceased\u2019s consent. It follows that the\nsimple inertia argument for shifting defaults is flawed. There is no\ndefault of non-retrieval in the absence of the deceased\u2019s\nconsent. Other arguments for variations of opting out turn on the\nempirical question of effects on retrieval. Since many different\nfactors affect retrieval rates, it is often hard to be confident about\nthe difference that changes to consent would make.\n1.2.4 Conscript Organs\n\nThe idea of conscription is to take organs in all suitable cases even\nwhen the deceased or family objected (except, perhaps, in cases of\nconscientious objection). Unlike the other reform proposals,\nconscription seems to have little political support. Nonetheless, some\npowerful philosophical arguments can be given for it. One argument,\nmentioned above, compares the strength of the interests of the\ndeceased, families, and potential recipients, and claims that the need\nfor transplants of those with organ failure is much greater than the\nneeds of the deceased or their families (Kamm 1993; Harris 2002,\n2003). Another argument draws an analogy with the relief of poverty.\nMany people think the state may use its coercive powers to transfer\nmaterial resources from those with a surplus to those with little. In\nother words, we think that people have welfare rights to resources.\nOne way to fulfill those rights is to tax the estates of the deceased.\nBy parity of reasoning, because organs are also resources and no\nlonger of use to the dead, they too should be coercively transferred\nto fulfill the welfare rights of those with organ failure (Fabre\n2006).\n\nConscription may be politically infeasible or be subject to practical\nobjections. But what of principled ethical objections? One could point\nto the distress that families would suffer (Brazier 2002), but what of\nthe distress of the families of people who die for want of an organ?\nOne could point to the interests of the deceased, but the arguments\nabove need not deny that the deceased have interests; they claim that\nthose interests are outweighed. One could claim that the deceased have\nrights that protect their interests and deny that potential recipients\nhave rights to organs. Even if the deceased have rights and potential\nrecipients do not, it would have to be shown that the rights of the\ndeceased are not outweighed by the needs of those with organ\nfailure.\n1.2.5 Further Proposals\n\nAs noted above, many factors affect the supply of organs and\ntransplantation systems have made clinical, logistical, and marketing\nattempts to increase supply. Some of these raise ethical questions.\nConsider preparing for organ retrieval patients who are not yet dead,\nfor example by ventilating patients thought likely to die in the near\nfuture. If the preparatory measures are permitted, more donors would\nbecome available than if they are not. But these measures would not be\ndone for the therapeutic benefit of the patient. They would be\ncontrary to a duty to act only in the best interests of the patient,\nat least when \u201cbest interests\u201d are understood as only\nmedical interests. On the other hand, if \u201cbest interests\u201d\nwere understood more broadly, as explained in\n 2.1\n below, then in some cases, such as where the patient had agreed to\ndonate, the preparatory measures might be in the patient\u2019s\nnon-medical interests. In any case, the measures need not be against\nthe patient\u2019s medical interests.\n\nAs for social marketing (or \u201cnudging\u201d) to try to increase\nconsent rates, these might target potential donors, as with campaigns\nto increase the number on a donor registry, or the families of those\nwho have died, say by using specially trained people to ask their\nconsent. In some cases, these ideas invite the question of whether\nthey involve manipulation and whether any consent obtained is valid\n(Sharif and Moorlock 2018; T.M. Wilkinson 2011). They also raise again\nthe question of how much it would matter if consent were not valid if\nthe supply of organs increased.\n2. Organ Retrieval from Living Donors\n\nThe successful early transplants used organs taken from living donors.\nFor a long time the hope was that, when technical problems were\novercome, enough organs would be supplied by dead donors (Price 2009).\nThat way, healthy living people need not undergo the risk and\ndiscomfort of non-therapeutic organ retrieval. That hope however was\nfalse and the persistent shortage of donors has led to the increasing\nuse of living donors. It has been reported that 37,360 live donor\nkidney transplants occurred in 2019\n (Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation),\n over 37% of the global total. For livers, the global total from\nliving donors was 7,610, over 21% of the total. Rules governing living\ndonation have generally become more permissive, allowing donations\nfrom close genetic relatives, then spouses, then partners and friends,\nand, in some jurisdictions, even strangers.\n\nThe primary ethical question raised by living donation is to do with\nthe risk of having an organ taken. Having an organ taken imposes risks\nof death, disease, and discomfort from trauma, infection, the use of a\ngeneral anaesthetic, and the loss of all or part of an organ (although\nthe liver will usually regenerate, replacing the part removed). These\nrisks are not negligible. However, the risk of death is not enormous.\nFocusing on the kidney, the most frequently donated organ and the\nsafest to take from live donors, it has been estimated that the risk\nof death from kidney retrieval is 1/3000. There appears to be no\ndifference between healthy screened living kidney donors and the\ngeneral population in long-term survival and the risk of kidney\nfailure. (Ibrahim et al. 2009). That said, the general population is\nless healthy on average than the healthy screened living donors, who\ndo in fact undergo some extra risk of long-term renal failure as a\nresult of one kidney being removed (Grams et al. 2016).\n\nUnder what conditions, if any, is it permissible to impose such a risk\non someone who will receive no therapeutic benefit? For competent\npeople, it is overwhelmingly accepted that their valid consent is a\nnecessary condition of morally permissible retrieval. (A very few\nwriters disagree, e.g., Rakowski 1991 and, less clearly, Fabre 2006).\nBut even if consent is necessary, it may not be sufficient, and a\nfurther question is how much risk it is permissible to impose even on\nthose who consent. Living donor transplantation also raises important\nquestions about the validity of consent and about whether organs may\never be taken from healthy non-competent people, such as children.\n2.1 \u201cDo no harm\u201d\n\nMedical ethics traditionally instructs clinicians not to harm people.\nTaking organs from healthy people does seem to harm them, so living\ndonor transplantation appears contrary to traditional medical ethics.\nOne reply is to say that the \u201cdo no harm\u201d rule is a relic\nof the medical profession\u2019s paternalism; if people want to\ndonate their organs and know what they are doing, why stop them\n(Veatch and Ross 2015)? This reply raises the difficult problem,\ndiscussed below, of how far consent justifies harm. Another reply is\nto say that taking organs from willing living donors may not be\nall-things-considered harmful to them (Spital 2004). This reply\nusually draws on one of the following normative views: (a) that living\ndonation is only permissible when we expect the donor not to be\nharmed; or (b) that it is only permissible when we expect the donor to\nbenefit (in both cases, all things considered, taking account of a\nwider range of factors than just physical wellbeing) (Williams\n2018).\n\nSuppose a person were prevented from donating an organ. On the one\nhand, the person would avoid the risks of physical harm. But, on the\nother, the person may suffer what are, in the medical literature,\ncalled \u201cpsychosocial harms\u201d. These could include\nloneliness from losing a relative, having to act as caregiver to a\nperson with organ failure, and survivor guilt. In philosophical terms,\na person may also suffer vicarious harm. People whose welfare is\nintertwined with others suffer a loss when the other person does\n(Feinberg 1984; Raz 1986). Quite possibly, then, a person who donates\nmay not suffer harm all-things-considered, that is, when all the\ndifferent instances of harm are weighed up.\n\nThe \u201cdo no harm\u201d argument against living donation is not\nwidely accepted\u2014that is why living donation proceeds apace.\nNonetheless, even if the physical harm can be outweighed by the need\nto avoid other harms, or by consent, or both, one may think that as a\nmatter of policy living donation should be discouraged. One fear is\nthat increasing the use of living donors relieves the pressure to find\nways to get more organs from other sources, notably the deceased.\n2.2 Valid Consent\n\nAssuming consent is ethically necessary before taking organs from\nliving competent people, questions arise about what makes consent\nvalid. The usual answer in medical ethics is that consent must be free\n(voluntary), sufficiently informed, and made by someone with the\ncapacity (competence) to consent. Thus, in the context of living\ndonation, people must know what living donation involves, including\nthe risks to them and the chances of success for the recipient, they\nmust be able to decide freely whether to donate, and they must be\ncompetent to do so. (See the entry on\n informed consent.)\n\nCan people freely give consent when considering whether to donate to a\nclose relative? It may be thought that consent in such a case is\nsuspect because potential donors would be: (1) desperate to save their\nrelatives (2) subject to a feeling of moral obligation or (3) subject\nto family pressure. The first two reasons are not good ones. People\ngive valid consent in other desperate circumstances, for instance to a\nlifesaving operation, and acting out of a reasonable sense of moral\nobligation is a way of exercising one\u2019s freedom rather than a\nconstraint upon it (we consider below unusual senses of obligation in\nthe context of religious stranger donation) (Radcliffe-Richards 2006;\nT.M. Wilkinson and Moore 1997).\n\nFamily pressure is different. Family pressure may take the form of\ncredible threats of violence, in which case the potential donor is\ncoerced and any consent invalid. Family pressure may be felt as a form\nof moral obligation on the part of the donor, in which case (see\nabove) consent would not be made invalid for that reason. Somewhat\nharder to think through is family pressure that consists of the\nimplicit threat of ostracism. On the one hand, that pressure may be\nvery effective. On the other, it works by family members withdrawing\ntheir goodwill, something people are generally entitled to do. Some\nviews of coercion and valid consent imply that consent to avoid\nostracism would be valid (e.g., Nozick 1974); others do not (e.g.,\nCohen 1988). As it happens, transplanters will often furnish reluctant\ndonors with \u201cwhite lies\u201d to enable them to avoid donating\nwhile retaining the appearance of honour. For instance, reluctant\ndonors may be told to say they are clinically unsuitable on anatomical\ngrounds. Whether \u201cwhite lies\u201d are mandatory or even\npermissible depends partly on resolving the question of when family\npressure undercuts valid consent (den Hartogh 2008b).\n\nMany living donor programs use extensive psychosocial screening as\nwell as a lengthy consent process (Price 2000). Potential donors are\nscreened for physical health, which is largely uncontroversial, but\nthey are also screened for their motivations. The typical advice is to\nscreen for excessive sense of duty, undue influence, unconscious\ninternal neurotic influences, and abnormal emotional involvement.\nScreening of this nature is more controversial since it involves\nmaking difficult judgments about what counts as excessive in a sense\nof duty, undue in influence, and abnormal in emotional involvement,\nand it requires spotting neurotic influences. At least in the past,\nsome critics have thought that transplant professionals have overused\ntheir power to refuse people as donors (MacFarquhar 2009).\n\nTo take one example, consider whether a member of a religious sect,\nsuch as the Jesus Christians, should be allowed to donate to a\nstranger. It may be thought that such a person could not be giving\nvalid consent, perhaps because of what a sect has done (the\n\u201cbrainwashing\u201d worry) or because of some psychological\nvulnerability. However, it is often difficult to decide whether a way\nof influencing someone is illegitimate or whether motivations and\nbeliefs are signs of mental illness (see entry on\n mental disorder).\n2.3 The moral force of consent\n\nAssuming a potential donor would give valid consent, how far would\nthat justify retrieval of organs? The \u201cdo no harm\u201d rule\nimplies that people should not be harmed even with their consent\nalthough, as was said earlier, some living organ donation may not harm\nthe donor all-things-considered. Suppose a man wanted to donate his\nsecond kidney to his second son, having already donated a kidney to\nanother son, thus paying the price of a life on dialysis. Suppose a\nparent wanted to donate her heart to her child, thus causing her own\ndeath. Would transplant teams act wrongly if they took organs in such\ncases? And\u2014what is a separate question\u2014should they be\nallowed to?\n\nIt cannot be assumed that, in these desperate cases, the parents would\nbe all-things-considered harmed by retrieval. Whether they are would\ndepend on how the correct specification of harm handles vicarious\nharms and psychosocial harms. Perhaps a parent could be better off\ndead than to have to live without her child (which is not to say that\nher reason to donate is self-interest).\n\nSuppose, though, that genuinely consensual organ retrieval would\nall-things-considered harm the donor. One way to try to decide when\nretrieval should nonetheless be permitted is to compare the values of\nautonomy with well-being. The question would then become an aspect of\nfamiliar debates about paternalism and the limits of consent. Living\ndonation does have the unusual twist that, if one were to prevent\ndonation, one would prevent an act of considerable value to a badly\noff person, the potential recipient. Moreover, to prevent living\ndonation would be dissimilar to many acts of state paternalism, such\nas mandatory wearing of seat belts or the prohibition of certain\ndrugs, in that donating an organ would not generally be the result of\ninattention, weak-will, addiction, or excessive short-sightedness.\nBecause of its value to the recipient and because donors\u2019\nchoices are not obviously flawed, living donation of the sorts that\nactually take place should be allowed and seems ethically\npermissible.\n\nWhat about organ donation that goes beyond what is currently\npermitted, such as the donation of the second kidney or donation of an\norgan necessary for life? Liberal democracies do not generally allow\nconsent to be a defense to bodily harm at or well below the level of\ndeath (Price 2000), but should they? The answer turns in part on how\nfar third parties\u2014transplant teams in this case\u2014may\ninflict harms on those who genuinely give autonomous consent or, to\nput it another way, the extent to which autonomous people can waive\ntheir rights of bodily integrity. But policy considerations are also\nrelevant. Can one be sure that consent is genuine? Would some people\nbe forced into consenting in a way that a screening process would fail\nto detect? If so, how much weight should be attached to cases where\norgans are taken without genuine consent? These questions arise for\nliving donation in general, but the errors are worse in cases where\nsevere harm or death is the certain consequence of donation. (The\nquestions also arise in the debates about whether voluntary slavery or\neuthanasia should be permitted (Feinberg 1986)).\n2.4 Incompetent living donors\n\nAlthough rules and practices governing living donation have generally\nbecome more permissive in most respects, they have become stricter in\nthe case of incompetent donors (Price 2000). Only six living kidney\ndonations by minors were performed between 2000 and 2015 in the U.S.,\nfor example. Additionally, in the U.S., just 20 minors have donated a\nliver lobe or segment since 1987. In Europe, only three cases of\nliving kidney donation by minors have been reported, all involving\nadolescents and occurring in the U.K. prior to 2006 (Van Assche et\nal. 2016).\n\nAs the discussion above of psychosocial screening implies, competence\nis not always easily determined, but let us assume in this section\nthat we are considering clearly incompetent donors, namely\nrelatively young children and people with severe mental disabilities\nor illnesses.\n\nIf valid consent were a necessary condition of ethically permissible\norgan retrieval from the living, then retrieval from incompetent\ndonors would be wrong. However, it is not clear why consent should be\na necessary condition in all cases rather than only in those cases\nwhere people are capable of giving it.\n\nSeveral arguments have been given for permitting retrieval from\nincompetent people. Utilitarian arguments appear to permit retrieval\nbecause the donor loses less than the recipient gains. On the face of\nit, however, that argument would support organ conscription from\nliving competent people too. Some people have argued in specific cases\nthat the person would have wanted to donate, thus using the idea of\nsubstituted judgment familiar in other cases of deciding for\nincompetent patients. However, substituted judgment is misapplied in\ncases where the person is not, and never has been, competent (Buchanan\nand Brock 1990). More plausibly, it may be thought that, at least in\nsome cases, incompetent donors are not harmed by donating an organ. If\na child\u2019s donation would save the life of a sibling with organ\nfailure, the donor may gain in the psychosocial and vicarious senses\ndescribed above in the discussion of the \u201cdo no harm\u201d\nrule. Donors may be no worse off for donating, in which case organ\nretrieval would not infringe the \u201cdo no harm\u201d rule (T.M.\nWilkinson 2011).\n\nEven if organ retrieval from an incompetent donor were ethically\npermissible in a given case, it may be that policy considerations,\nsuch as the risk of abuse, would justify an outright ban. Some\nwriters, though, believe that legal safeguards would be enough to\nprotect incompetent donors from abuse (Munson 2002).\n3. The Allocation of Organs\n\nThe scarcity of organs creates an allocation problem. A great deal has\nbeen written in philosophy on the principles of the allocation of\nscarce resources, although not much on the allocation of organs\nspecifically (see the entries on\n distributive justice;\n equality;\n justice and access to health care).\n Unsurprisingly, many of the principles cited in official\ntransplantation allocation documents are familiar (see\n Other Internet Resources:\n TSANZ 2014; NHSBT 2013). These principles include allocating to those\nwho would benefit the most (a proxy for utility), to those who are the\nsickest (a proxy for helping the worst off), to those whose medical\ncondition will deteriorate the soonest (urgency), and to those who\nhave been waiting the longest (often linked to equity). Official\ndocuments also stress principles of non-discrimination, which are\ntaken to exclude allocating according to judgments of social worth, as\nwell as race, sex, religion etc. In practice, the principles conflict;\nthe person waiting the longest may not be the one who would gain the\nmost from a transplant, for example. So official allocation protocols\nalso have to say how the conflict between principles should be\nresolved. (For a philosophical discussion of the principles and their\napplication to organ allocation see Kamm 1993.)\n\nThis entry does not provide a full account of allocation principles\nfor organs. Rather, it aims to do three specific things. First, it\nexplains some of the features of allocation of organs that need to be\ntaken into account when applying basic principles. This section draws\nto the attention of philosophers the real-world complexity of applying\nabstract principles of allocation. Second, it discusses the problems\nof responsibility for condition and social value. These problems are\nboth ethically interesting and, while not unique to organ allocation,\nare more poignant than for other scarce resources because they often\ncannot be avoided just by making more money available. Third, it\ndescribes some transplantation-specific cases of the interaction\nbetween allocation rules and the number of organs retrieved for\ntransplantation. These cases raise doubts about the coherence of some\nactually existing allocation practices.\n3.1 The complexity of organ allocation\n\nThe allocation of organs is certainly not just a medical problem to be\nsolved with medical expertise (Veatch and Ross 2015). The principles\nthat apply to allocation are quintessentially ethical principles.\nHowever, applying those principles correctly to produce final answers\nas to who receives organs does require medical knowledge and much\nother knowledge besides. To see the point, imagine that we have to\ndesign an organ allocation scheme.\n\nSuppose we start with first-best principles, such as allocation\naccording to need, or urgency, or benefit, or equity, or some mix of\nthese principles based on some judgment of their relative weight.\nClearly, applying these principles requires considering what organs\ndo. Organs differ in many ways that matter to allocation, such as\n\n\nalternative treatments to transplantation, the ability to stratify\nrisk, the different factors that affect patient and/or graft survival,\nand differences in the interactions between donor graft and recipients\non outcomes. (NHSBT 2013, p. 8)\n\n\nTo explain just one of these factors, nearly all patients in rich\ncountries whose kidneys have failed have the alternative of dialysis,\nwhereas most of those with acute liver failure have no alternative to\ntransplantation but death. Liver allocation, to a much greater extent\nthan kidney allocation, must thus make some judgment about the\nimportance of saving lives immediately compared with, for instance,\nimproving quality or extending lifespan.\n\nNext, the application of the principles ought to range across all the\nstages of transplantation. Details vary from place to place and organ\nto organ but in general the pathway to transplantation can be thought\nof as having these steps: being referred for assessment; being\nassessed and then listed; and receiving an organ once listed. People\nmay be halted at each step, perhaps for medical reasons, perhaps\nbecause they cannot pay (the so-called \u201cgreen screen\u201d) or\nbecause the public system will not pay. Principles need to range over\nall steps. For instance, scrupulous fairness to those on a waiting\nlist may obscure injustice in access to the list.\n\nImplementing first-best principles can have important secondary\nconsequences. To take one example, the scheme the U.S. introduced in\n1989 to allocate kidneys increased the weighting for immune system\ncompatibility and the effect was to reduce the proportion of\nAfrican-Americans transplanted (Elster 1992: ch. 5). Many thought the\nresult inequitable because of the disparate impact even though the\ndifference was not due to overt discrimination (see the entry on\n justice, inequality, and health).\n\nIn addition, a scheme must take account of procedural values such as\ntransparency, non-arbitrariness, and public deliberation (Miller 1999,\nch.5). For instance, we may think that time spent waiting on a list is\nonly a rough proxy for fairness. Perhaps someone entered a list late\nbecause of the difficulties in finding the time and resources to\ncomplete the requirements for listing; in perfect fairness that person\nshould not be disadvantaged as a result. And yet time waiting is a\nvisible and checkable criterion, whereas taking account of diverse\nsocial and economic circumstances would be procedurally fraught when\nit comes to ordering a priority list.\n\nFinally, allocation must take account of incentives in two distinct\nways. It must consider how the scheme would be operated. The ideal\napplication of first-best principles would require considerable\nflexibility and discretion. Fixed rules or algorithms inevitably fail\nto capture all the relevant information. And yet flexibility and\ndiscretion are open to gaming by doctors and patients, for instance in\nexaggerating the urgency of transplanting a patient. Thus incentive\neffects may make an ideal method sub-ideal in practice.\n\nAllocation must also consider the incentive effects of an allocation\nscheme on the size of the donor pool.\n\nThis topic is discussed below.\n3.2 Self-inflicted illness and social value\n\nTwo other specific allocation questions are:\n\nShould people who have caused themselves to be in need of a\ntransplant by leading a \u201chigh risk\u201d life be assigned lower\npriority?\nShould people who are more \u201csocially valuable\u201d be\nassigned higher priority?\n\n\nSome people increase their chances of needing a transplant organ by\nleading what they know to be unhealthy lifestyles. Many of those who\nsmoke, or drink alcohol excessively, or eat too much know that they\nare acting unhealthily (whether or not they know that smoking\nincreases the risks of heart and lung failure, that drinking increases\nthe risk of liver failure, and that obesity increases the risk of\nkidney and pancreas failure). It has been suggested that such people\nforfeit or weaken their claims to medical treatment (Brown 2013; Buyx\n2008; Smart 1994; Walker 2010).\n\nThere is one \u201cnon-ethical\u201d argument for this view, called\nthe Medical Argument. According to this:\n\n\n\u2026 patients with self-inflicted illness \u2026 should have\nlower priority in access to health care because they are more likely\nto experience poor medical outcomes. (Sharkley and Gillam 2010:\n661)\n\n\nOn the factual premise, it seems false that as a class those with\n\u201cself-inflicted\u201d illness would do so badly they should be\ndeprioritized (Munson 2002), although transplant systems often do try\nto screen out those who would continue to act in ways that jeopardize\ntheir new organs. In any case, the Medical Argument is essentially\njust an application of more general cost-effectiveness criteria and\nnot something that requires a special ethical justification. The\narguments considered below, in contrast, are ones which claim that\n(for example) heavy drinkers and smokers should have lower priority\naccess to organs even if they are no more likely than others\nto experience poor transplant outcomes. There are three main ethical\narguments for this claim, two of which are clearly quite weak; a\nthird, the Restoration Argument, is worth taking more seriously.\n\nThe first argument concerns incentives. It says that if (for\nexample) we refuse to provide heavy drinkers with liver transplants\nthen this will discourage irresponsible drinking. Similar things are\nsaid about overeating and obesity.\n\nThe argument however is problematic. To continue with alcohol, would\norgan allocation policy really make much difference to people\u2019s\ndrinking-behavior? Some reasons for thinking not include:\n\nThe very long-term nature of the calculation that drinkers would\nbe required to make. They would need to gamble on organ allocation\npolicies staying as they are for perhaps many decades and would need\nto trade off highly speculative longer-term gains (maybe needing and\nthen getting an organ many years down the line) against short-term\npleasure and reward (having another drink now).\nSerious liver disease ought to be incentive enough. If the\nprospect of serious organ failure is not acting as an incentive then\nwhat are the chances of allocation policy doing so?\nMany heavy drinkers are dependent on alcohol and so incentives may\nnot engage them effectively. Similar things might be said about\nsmoking, illegal drug use, and even diet (Walker 2010).\n\n\nAnother challenge for the incentives approach is that if the rationale\nfor deprioritising heavy drinkers, say, is simply incentivisation then\nthere is no reason to restrict these measures to cases of organ\nfailure. Why not instead remove their driving licenses, or their\naccess to non-urgent healthcare, or subject them to punitive rates of\ntax? Such measures could all be incentives to stop drinking\nand would surely be more effective\u2014not least because their\neffects would be felt straightaway, rather than many years down the\nline.\n\nThe next argument suggests that heavy drinkers and smokers should be\ndeprioritised on transplant waiting lists as a punishment for\nwrongdoing. There are several reasons to reject such a position:\n\nUnhealthy behavior such as excessive drinking, overeating, and\nsmoking may well not be morally wrong nor merit punishment.\nIf punishing wrongdoing is the purpose of the allocation exercise\nthen there are probably more deserving candidates for punishment than\nthose who overindulge (even if there is something morally\nwrong with such overindulgence).\nUsing healthcare resource allocation as a mode of punishment is\nimpracticable and unfair, and may have adverse consequences (such as\nnegative effects on public attitudes to organ donation and to\ndoctors). Selecting only certain risky behavior as immoral seems\narbitrary. Waiving that problem, how are judgments about causal and\nmoral responsibility to be made in a timely and cost-effective way,\nand how are doctors going to make them? Punishment should only be\nmeted out by state bodies (i) for prohibited acts (so not, in most\ncountries, drinking, overeating, and smoking) and (ii) following\n\u201cdue process\u201d in a court (Harris 1985).\n\n\nA version of objection (c) applies to an opposite policy proposal:\nthat higher priority should be given to patients with\nhigh social value. This \u201csocial value\u201d could\neither be instrumental (doctors, nurses, parents of young children\nperhaps) or moral (prioritising the virtuous). The fundamental\nobjection to rewarding social value is that it infringes a principle\nof equal treatment but, putting that aside, it has the practical and\nfairness problems of the punishment proposal. How is social value to\nbe determined and then how is it to be applied in a timely and\ncost-effective manner? And, given the potentially dire consequences of\nbeing assigned low social value (which could in practice be a\n\u201cdeath sentence\u201d), procedurally it seems reasonable to\nexpect something akin to a court hearing. A version of allocating\naccording to perceived social value (among other criteria) was tried\nin Seattle in the 1960s in allocating very scarce dialysis (Alexander\n1962). The result seems to have removed any enthusiasm among\ntransplant systems for trying it again.\n\nPerhaps one exception to this is giving higher priority to frontline\nhealthcare workers in situations where such workers are themselves a\nscarce resource, and where therefore there would be fewer transplants\noverall if sick healthcare workers were not prioritised. The\njustification here is that whereas many other \u201csocial\nvalue\u201d based allocation decisions are zero-sum games,\nprioritising healthcare workers could instead increase the total\nnumber of available transplants. This argument has some merit but is\nnot fundamentally so much about social value per se as about\nthe pragmatics of maximising lives saved. Thus, social value\nnotwithstanding, if the healthcare labor market was oversupplied and\ndoctors and nurses could easily be replaced then this pragmatic\nargument would not apply. Conversely, this pragmatic argument could\napply to any shortage profession: e.g. in a situation where,\nbecause of a shortage of Human Resources consultants in the health\nsector, fewer operations are taking place than would otherwise be the\ncase.\n\nThe most promising argument in favor of deprioritising those with\n\u201cunhealthy\u201d lifestyles is the Restoration Argument, which\ngoes as follows (Harris 1985; Smart 1994; S. Wilkinson 1999).\n\nSome people (risk-takers) knowingly and voluntarily have\nunhealthy and/or dangerous lifestyles.\nRisk-takers are more likely to need transplant organs\nthan the general population (non-risk-takers).\nTransplant organs are in short supply.\nBecause of (2) and (3), if we allocate on the basis of clinical\nneed or clinical outcomes alone, non-risk-takers will be\nharmed by the risk-takers\u2019 lifestyle choices;\nthe non-risk-takers\u2019 chances of getting a transplant\norgan will be lower because of the risk-takers\u2019\nincreased demands on the system.\nTo allow the non-risk-takers to be harmed by the\nrisk-takers would be unfair. Why should\nnon-risk-takers have to pay the price for\nrisk-takers\u2019 lifestyle choices?\nIn order to avoid this unfairness, risk-takers\u2019\nentitlements should be reduced such that there is no harm to the\nnon-risk-takers.\n\n\nOne of the most attractive features of this argument is that it\ngrounds the deprioritisation of those with unhealthy lifestyles not in\nvalue judgments about their lifestyles, but rather in a more neutral\nset of concerns about preventing harm to innocent third parties. Thus\nthis argument could apply regardless of whether the risk-taking\nbehavior in question is virtuous or vicious.\n\nEven this argument faces difficulties though. One is that risk-taking\nmay not generate additional healthcare costs or demand for organs.\nIndeed, some kinds of risk-taking behavior (motor sports perhaps)\ncould even increase the supply of high-quality cadaveric organs\navailable for transplant.\n\nS. Wilkinson (1999) takes this fact as a point of departure for a\ndeeper critique of the Restoration Argument. He claims that, if it\nturned out (as is possible in many European countries) that smokers\ncost the state less than non-smokers overall (because on\naverage they die younger, and hence consume fewer health and social\ncare resources in retirement) then proponents of the Restoration\nArgument would be committed to the unpalatable conclusion that smokers\nshould be given not lower but higher priority than other\npatients. Otherwise smokers would be harmed by the non-smokers\u2019\ndeliberate attempts to extend their own lives by avoiding smoking. His\nargument is about financial resources but similar considerations would\napply to organs in relevantly similar situations of scarcity.\n\nWilkinson concludes that this objection seriously weakens the\nRestoration Argument. Either it is simply a reductio ad\nabsurdum of the Restoration Argument, in which case the argument\nmust be rejected wholesale. Or at least its defenders will need to\nappeal to something else, such as moral or social value, in order to\navoid the argument\u2019s unacceptable consequences\u2014thus making\nit vulnerable to some of the problems with appealing to social value\nnoted above (Walker 2010; S. Wilkinson 1999).\n\nAnother wider issue with all of the arguments in this section is that\nassigning responsibility for patterns of action and saying what\nresponsibility amounts to in such cases will be complex, often\ninvolving the interaction of multiple agents and multiple\nenvironmental, genetic, and social factors (Brown & Savulescu\n2019). Therefore, at least in practice, ascertaining for which health\nstates an individual is sufficiently responsible will be too difficult\nand multi-faceted for use in allocation decisions.\n3.3 The interaction of allocation and donation\n\nIn the economy, the amount produced depends in part on how production\nwill be allocated, at least insofar as people respond to incentives\n(see the entry on\n distributive justice).\n For instance, a guaranteed equal share gives no self-interested\nincentive to work hard or in an efficient job. In organ\ntransplantation, the number of organs available also depends on how\nthey would be allocated. In the economy, ideal allocation principles\nmay have to yield to the reality of incentives, which is why it is\noften thought that strict equality is precluded by concern for\nefficiency. Similarly, transplantation seems to face a choice; it can\nkeep its ideal principles and have fewer organs or compromise them and\nhave more. Some examples discussed here are live donation, kidney\nexchanges, directed deceased donation, priority to donors, and\npriority to children. These examples are diverse so one cannot\nstraightforwardly tell whether practice in one is consistent with\npractice in another. Nonetheless, they have in common the question:\nwhat if the usual principles of allocation led to fewer organs being\ndonated than would deviating from those principles? That they have\nthis question in common has not been widely appreciated, which may\nexplain why the question has been answered in different ways in the\nexamples described below.\n\nLive donation. Most live organ donations have a designated\nrecipient, usually a relative or friend (Baily et al. 2020). Usually\nthe designated recipient is not the person who would have got the\norgan if it were allocated via the method for deceased donor organs.\nTransplantation systems could refuse such offers for the sake of their\nnormal allocation principles\u2014but they do not. One obvious\nsufficient reason is that, if the organs were not allocated to the\nperson the donor designates, the donor would not donate and an organ\nwould be forgone.\n\nThe suspension of normal allocation principles when live donation is\ninvolved often passes by without notice, although one recent exception\nis a debate over people on transplant waiting lists who use social\nmedia campaigns to find willing donors (Moorlock 2015; Moorlock and\nDraper 2018). Such cases are a good illustration of the shape of the\nunderlying issue. If these donors were merely being redirected \u2013 that\nis, if they were intending to donate anyway, even without a social\nmedia campaign \u2013 then arguably suspending the normal principles would\nbe tantamount to unfair queue jumping via what has been termed a\n\u201cbeauty contest\u201d. But if these social media campaigns\nbring new donors and extra organs into the system, and provided that\nother ethical conditions are met (notably the valid consent of the\ndonor), then it would seem churlish to reject such offers, given their\ncapacity to extend and/or improve recipients\u2019 lives.\n\nKidney exchange. Sometimes potential live kidney donors\ncannot donate to the recipients they wish because their kidneys are\nincompatible with the recipient\u2019s body. Many systems now arrange\ncomplicated swaps whereby pairs or more than pairs of live donors give\nto each other\u2019s recipients (Fortin 2013). Sometimes people\ndonate into the general pool in exchange for their preferred recipient\ngetting the next available deceased donor kidney. Unless the preferred\nrecipients would happen to get the deceased donor organ anyway under\nnormal allocation rules, they jump the queue. As with more common\nmethods of live donation, the normal allocation principles are\nsuspended so as not to forgo extra organs.\n\nDirected deceased donation. Much more controversial is\ndirected deceased donation. The direction can take the form of naming\na recipient, as when a dying person stipulates that she wants her\norgan to go to her daughter. Or it can take the form of specifying a\ngroup either to receive or be denied the organ. The most controversial\ndirection has been ethnic, when donors or their families have tried to\nprevent organs going to members of certain ethnic groups (T.M.\nWilkinson 2007b). On the face of it, refusing directed donations\nforgoes organs for the sake of a principle of allocation, which is the\nopposite of practice with live donation. Matters are more complicated\nbecause the overall incentive effects of accepting directed donations\nare unclear. However, jurisdictions such as the U.K. have banned\naccepting directed donation for reasons besides the overall effect on\nthe organ supply (U.K. Department of Health 2000 in\n Other Internet Resources).\n They have cited principles such as allocation according to need as\ngiving sufficient reason, independent of effect on numbers. A\nconsistency argument can be put to them: why do they accept deviations\nfrom allocation according to need in the case of live donation but\nreject them for deceased donation?\n\nPriority to donors. A minority of jurisdictions give some\npriority in receiving organs to those who have declared their\nwillingness to donate (Cronin 2014). One reason is the supposed\nincentive effect of giving priority to donors of encouraging more\ndonations. Priority schemes have been criticized on practical grounds\nbut some criticism invokes principles, such as allocation according to\nneed (Quigley et al. 2012). As before, the principles are supposed by\nthose who cite them to be sufficient to defeat priority schemes even\nif they would produce more organs. By contrast, the principles are not\nthought to outweigh getting more organs with live donation and kidney\nexchange.\n\nPriority to children. Nearly all jurisdictions give priority\nto children when allocating kidneys from deceased donors. One upshot\nseems to be a reduction in the overall supply of organs, at least in\nthe United States (Axelrod et al. 2010). People who would have been\nlive donors to children do not donate when the children get rapid\naccess to deceased donor kidneys. Perhaps potential living donors\nwould rather have the child get a deceased donor organ than run the\nrisk for themselves; perhaps they would like to hold their kidneys in\nreserve in case the children need retransplantation or other children\nneed them. One might think that if priority to children reduces the\nnumber of living donors to them it should increase the number of\nliving donors to adults. Nonetheless, the overall effect is negative.\nAs before, those who endorse the principle of priority to children\nhave some choosing to do; how many organs are they willing to forgo\nfor the sake of the principle, and is the answer consistent with their\nwillingness to accept designated live organ donations (T.M. Wilkinson\nand Dittmer 2016)? A more unpalatable choice would arise if\ndiscriminating against children produced more organs via live\ndonation.",
