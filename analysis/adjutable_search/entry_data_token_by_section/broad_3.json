    "main_text": "Perception || Prehension: the Core Notion of Perceptual Immediacy\n2.2 Prehension: the Core Notion of Perceptual Immediacy\n\nWhen we visually perceive the apple we have an experience in which its\nfacing red surface is a sensuously manifested objective constituent;\nwe perceive the apple but are, strictly speaking, only acquainted with\na portion of\n it.[2]\n Broad sometimes prefers to say that we prehend the facing\nsurface (or ostensibly prehend the surface). Now the notion of\nprehension is fundamental for an understanding of Na\u00efve Realism\nas well as Representational Realism, so it seems advisable to briefly\ntake a somewhat closer look on Broad\u2019s account of it.\n\nBroad does not think it is possible to give a strict definition of\nphrases such as \u201cS prehends x as red\u201d or\nthe equivalent phrase \u201cx sensibly presents itself to\nS as\n red\u201d.[3]\n What one can do is to contrast the notion of prehension with other\nnotions: \u201cThe meaning of these phrases cannot be defined, it can\nonly be exemplified. One thing that is certain is that to prehend\nx as red is utterly different from judging that it\nis red or knowing that it is red\u201d (1952a, p. 13;\nitalics in original). For example, in the dark and with my eyes shut I\nmay very well judge (or know) that the apple is red. But in such\nconditions I am \u201cnot prehending anything as red, or, what is\nprecisely equivalent, nothing is sensibly presented to me as\nred\u201d (ibid, p. 14). Broad notes that this is\nsubstantiated by the fact that a cat or a dog that lacked concepts\nmight, it seems, have a prehension of something as red even though it\ncannot (lacking the requisite concepts) literally know or judge that\nit is red.\n\nPrehension is, however, intimately related to knowledge. Broad asks us\nto consider a subject \u201cwhich has appropriate general concepts\nand is capable of making judgements and knowing facts\u201d. Suppose\nthis subject prehends a certain particular object as red. Then this\n\u201csuffices to enable him to know the fact that it is\nred. Whether he does or does not actually contemplate this\nfact at the time depends on various contingent circumstances\u201d\n(1952a, p. 14; Broad\u2019s\n emphasis).[4]\n",
