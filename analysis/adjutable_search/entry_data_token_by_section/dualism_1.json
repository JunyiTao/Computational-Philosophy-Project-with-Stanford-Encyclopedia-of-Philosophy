    "main_text": "Varieties of Dualism: Ontology\n2. Varieties of Dualism: Ontology\n\n\nThere are various ways of dividing up kinds of dualism. One natural\nway is in terms of what sorts of things one chooses to be dualistic\nabout. The most common categories lighted upon for these purposes are\nsubstance and property, giving one substance\ndualism and property dualism. There is, however, an\nimportant third category, namely predicate dualism. As this\nlast is the weakest theory, in the sense that it claims least, I shall\nbegin by characterizing it.\n",
