Perception, Concepts and Sense-Object Relations\n\nNoticing something coiled up in the corner of the room, I perceive it\nto be a piece of rope. Looking out of the window, I see that the sky\nis blue and see also, perhaps, the blueness of the sky. I see too that\nthe air is cold, and that there is nobody on the street. What do all\nthese experiences have in common, in virtue of which they are all acts\nof perception? The Manual of Reason (TS 46) gives the\nclassical Ny\u0101ya answer:\n\nPrinciple 1: In each case of perceptual experience,\nthe experience has as its special instrumental cause a\n\u2018connection\u2019 (sannikar\u1e63a) between the\nobject perceived and the perceiver\u2019s sense-faculty.\n\n\nAll seeings are the product of a sensory connection (of a type to be\nspecified) with the thing seen. This basic idea must be embellished in\ntwo ways before it is can serve as a proper a theory of perception:\n(i) some account must be given of the fact that, in all the cases\ncited above, the content of perception is semantically structured\n(e.g. that the thing in the corner is a piece of rope), for otherwise\nperceptual experiences would not be capable of being true, and hence\nfail to qualify as knowledge-episodes; (ii) an account must be given\nof the type of \u2018connection\u2019 involved here. Only then can\nwe evaluate the merits of the Ny\u0101ya theory.\n",
