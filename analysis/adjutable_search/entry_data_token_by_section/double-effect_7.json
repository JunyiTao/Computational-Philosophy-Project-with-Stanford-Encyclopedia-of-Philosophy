Double effect might seem to explain the contrasting\nimpermissibility of pushing someone onto the track in front of the\nspeeding trolley in order to stop it in order to protect five people\nwho cannot escape on the track ahead. In both scenarios, a person\nwould be killed as part of one\u2019s plan for saving the five.\nBecause of this, the difference in permissibility might seem to depend\non whether the death of that person is a means to saving the five or a\nside effect of doing so.\n\nDiscussions of the Trolley Problem and the relevance of the principle\nof double effect to explaining our intuition that it is permissible to\nswerve the trolley can be divided into three groups. First, there are\nthose who take the paired intuitions in the Trolley Problem as proof\nof the fundamental role of the distinction between intended means and\nforeseen side effects in an implicit principle guiding moral judgment\n(Mikhail, 2011). Second, some argue that it would be wrong for a\nbystander to switch the trolley (Thomson, 2008, contradicting Thomson\n1976 and 1985) and suggest that people\u2019s willingness to view it\nas permissible is a result of inadequate reflection. This group would\ninclude those who uphold an absolutist version of the principle of\ndouble effect and deny that it provides a permission to swerve the\ntrolley (Anscombe, 1982). Third, one could reject the claim that the\nprinciple of double effect could explain the permissibility of\nswitching the trolley (McIntyre, 2001), while remaining neutral about\nwhat verdict to render about such artificial cases.\n\nCan our intuitions about the Trolley Problem be generalized to other\ncases? Autonomous vehicles might be equipped with algorithms that\ntreat the alleged permissibility of swerving the trolley away from the\nfive and onto the one as an important precedent. Avoiding dangerous\ncollisions with other vehicles by swerving onto sidewalks where\npedestrians may or may not be be present might be viewed as ethically\nsimilar to swerving the trolley. Or, as Patrick Lin suggests (2016,\n76\u20137), an autonomous car driving on a cliffside roadway that\nencounters a school bus with many passengers that has moved into its\nlane as it rounds a sharp corner, might decide to sacrifice itself and\nits passengers to avoid the more dangerous collision with a school bus\nand the greater predicted loss of life. This should make us all\nconsider whether the highly abstract and context-less trolley problem\nelicits reliable moral judgments that can be used as a precedent in\nprogramming autonomous vehicles (see also discussion of the trolley\nproblem and autonomous vehicles in Nyholm and Smids 2016). You, as the\nBystander at the Switch, have no special positive duty toward the five\nthat requires you to assist them, and you have no special negative\nduty toward the one that requires you not to harm him. What duties\ndoes an autonomous vehicle have to its driver, other drivers, and\nnearby pedestrians? Have drivers assumed a risk simply by driving that\npedestrians have not assumed by using a sidewalk? Should the\nalgorithms promote ethical concerns or the interests of drivers? Who\nwould buy an autonomous vehicle that would always sacrifice its\npassengers to prevent greater loss of life?\n",
