It claims to be a revival of a broadly\nAristotelian hylomorphism, but it comes mainly from disputes in\nmereology.\n\nDavid Lewis famously propounded the doctrine of Unrestricted\nComposition: that is, any combination of things in the world\nconstitutes a further thing (e.g., 1986, 211). So my left foot and any\narbitrary stone at the bottom of the sea constitutes an object, though\nan object of no descriptive or explanatory interest. In the opposite\ncorner, Peter van Inwagen (1990) denied that there was any such thing\nas composition, at least for inanimate material objects.\n\nVan Inwagen\u2019s main argument is that necessary and sufficient\n(particularly sufficient) conditions cannot be given for the kind of\ncohesion of parts that is supposed to bind atoms into complexes. None\nof the standard candidates\u2014contact, fastening, adhesion, fusion,\nnor any acceptable disjunction of them\u2014will suffice. They all\nhave counterexamples. So the notion cannot be well defined. The\narguments are subtle and interesting. The question might be raised\nwhether van Inwagen gives sufficient consideration to the possibility\nof taking a line similar to that taken by Putnam on natural kinds. One\nfixes putative paradigm cases of non-living complexes, and says that\nthe kind of cohesion required is whatever sort of bonding holds in\nthose cases. It seems unlikely that there will not be a reasonably\ntidy, scientific account of how atoms bond. Nevertheless, van\nInwagen\u2019s mereological nihilism has a stopping point, namely\nthat he believes that he, though a composite material object, really\ndoes exist. So organisms do exist.\n\nVan Inwagen\u2019s unwillingness (unlike the early Unger (1975)) to\napply the nihilism to himself, and others like him, prompted the\nthought in other philosophers that there may be a way of having a\ndoctrine of Restricted Composition on the basis of being things of the\nright kind\u2014namely having a structure of the right kind\u2014and\nthat this idea resembled Aristotle\u2019s notion of form and his\ndoctrine of hylomorphism. Philosophers following this line of thought\nincluded Fine (1999, 2010), Johnston (2006), Lowe (2011), Koslicki\n(2008), Rea (2011) and Jaworski (2011, 2012). It is difficult to\nprovide a compact account of these philosophers\u2019 positions, as\nit can seem that all they have in common is a belief in some form of\nrestricted composition and a sense that the Aristotelian label\n\u2019hylomorphism\u2019 helps to give their theories a pedigree. My\nstrategy here will be to illustrate modern hylomorphism mainly using\nthe examples of Jaworski and Johnston, then citing a major problem for\nany theory of this general kind, and illustrating this by reference to\nMarmodoro (2013), where good discussions of Lowe, Koslicki and Rea can\nbe found.\n\nIf there is a single notion that plays a role in the rationale of the\nrestriction of composition, it is probably structure. Jaworski\nprobably deploys this notion in the most straightforward way. He and\nRea both use the following illustration. If you compact a human being\nin a machine or waterproof bag, you retain the same matter, but lose\nthe human being, because you have destroyed the structure. Structure\nis, therefore, a real and essential element in many or most complex\nobjects. He explains his theory as follows. \n\n\nHylomorphism claims\u2026[t]hat structure is a basic ontological and\nexplanatory category. (2011: 169)\n\nStructure is also a basic explanatory principle in that it explains\nwhy members of this or that kind are able to engage in the behaviors\nthey do. It is because humans are organized as they are, for instance,\nthat they are able to speak, to learn, to engage in the range of\nactivities that distinguish them from other living things and from\nnon-living ones. (2011: 172)\n\n\nI think all the hylomorphists would agree with these statements, but\nthey each have their own way of stating the theory and it is not easy\nto fit them together. Johnston\u2019s central account is as follows.\n\n\n\nA statement of the genuine parts and principle of unity of an\nitem\u2026takes the following canonical form:\n\nWhat it is for\u2026(the item is specified here)\u2026to\nbe is for\u2026(some parts are specified here)...to have the\nproperty or stand in the relation\u2026(the principle of unity\nis specified here).\n\n\nAs in: What it is for this hydrochloric acid molecule to be\nis for this positive hydrogen ion and this negative chlorine ion\nto be bonded together. \u2026 The idea that each complex item\nwill have some such canonical statement true of it might be fairly\ncalled \u2018Hylomorphism\u2019. For it is the idea that each\ncomplex item admits of a real definition, or statement of its essence,\nin terms of its matter, understood as parts or components, and its\nform, understood as a principle of unity. (2006: 658)\n\n\nBut Johnston\u2019s notion of a \u2018principle of unity\u2019\nturns out to be so generous that his theory almost collapses into\nLewis\u2019s.\n\nConsider then all the myriad ways of constructing putative wholes from\nitems gravitationally related to other items. Are they all genuine\nwholes? Given Hylomorphism, there does not seem to be any happy way to\ninsist that they are not all wholes, even though very few of\nthem will be material objects or stable physical systems\u2026A\nwhole consisting of your eyeglasses and Pluto is too far from [normal\nphysical object] paradigms in respect of compactness and maximality to\ncount as a genuine whole in the ordinary sense. But it is fully,\ncompletely and genuinely true that it is a whole. (2006: 697)\n\n\nOne might wonder whether such an apparatus preserves what one might\nwant to save from a common-sense notion of composition.\n\nA general worry about the hylomorphist approach might be put as\nfollows. The modern hylomorphists do not claim to be interpreting\nAristotle, but to be inspired by his concept of form. This means that\nit is out of place simply to argue that they have not interpreted him\nin a scholarly fashion. Nevertheless, it is relevant to point it out\nif they have totally misunderstood his deployment of the concept of\nform, for if this is the case, it might suggest that they are\npretending to a solution to the composition problem that they do not\npossess. Someone who was sceptical about their claim to a solution\nmight start by pointing out that all the moderns reject the\n\u2019traditional\u2019 Aristotelian idea that form has a role as an\nefficient cause, actually making a difference to the way that its\nmatter behaves. They deny this because they all want their theories to\nbe consistent with the closure of the world under physics. At the same\ntime, they seem to intend their composites to have full ontological\nweight, and to have causal efficacy.\n\nJaworski is particularly clear in emphasising that he is a causal\npluralist and that the structural level is in no sense\nepiphenomenal or a mere logical construct out of the lower properties\n(see his 2011: 174). But one might query whether this is consistent\nwith accepting the possibility of closure under physics. Such closure\nnaturally raises the question of the causal claims made for form or\nstructure, and, hence, for their ontological weight. The importance of\nexplanations at the level of complex structures is not\ndisputed, but whether these represent just ways of\nconceptualising a fundamental level that we cannot normally\naccess, is another matter. Johnston raises this question (2006:\n660\u201362) but leaves it unresolved. Jaworski insists on causal\npluralism, but admits \u201call forces are operating at a fundamental\nphysical level\u201d: This latter remark seems to concede that what\none has in fact is an explanatory pluralism, with causation\nincluded in the domain of explanation, but all the brute force\nis confined to physics. Johnston is keen to deny that\nexplanation is a subjective or psychological phenomenon, but\nadmitting this does not place explanation in the world, in the sense\nin which the forces that actually make things happen are in the world:\nit only gives them the Platonic objectivity of propositions or\ntheories. \n\nIt seems that modern hylomorphism faces the following dilemma. The\nfollowing argument has appeal. \n\nThe concept of structure is essential to all or most natural\nsciences.\nIf something is essential to a valid mode of explanation or\nunderstanding, then it should be conceived realistically.\n\n\ntherefore\n\nThere are real structures in the world.\n\n\nBut the following also has appeal.\n\nIt is sufficient for the concept of structure to be applicable\nthat elements be appropriately arranged in the world, and these\narrangements can be characterised without employing the notion of\nstructure. This could be done by specifying the spatio-temporal\nlocation of the elements and their causal influence on each\nother.\n\n\nIf (4) is correct, it looks as if, though our structural concepts are\nwell grounded in reality, structures are not part of the basic\nfurniture of the world. This is, in fact, the same issue as whether\nKim\u2019s exclusion principle applies to the special sciences: that\nis, if physics gives a sufficient causal account of the location of\nall matter, are the other sciences merely heuristics, but strictly\nepiphenomenal? (see Kim 2005 and Robinson 2014). Perhaps the status of\nform and structure cannot be solved in a modern context without\nsolving the exclusion issue. \n\nAnna Marmodoro (2013) argues that the modern hylomorphists have\nmisunderstood Aristotle in a radical fashion, in a way that is\ndirectly connected with their concern about the unity and hence\nreality of composites. She claims, with strong backing from the text,\nthat form is not structure, because it is not a combination of parts.\nThe essence of form is its unity, and its unity depends essentially on\nthe fact that the matter that comes to compose it loses its previous\nidentity. By contrast, in any kind of structure of parts this identity\nis not lost; the parts are merely organised in a certain way.\n\nOn this interpretation, Aristotle must deny the core of (4), which is\nthat the behaviour of complexes derives necessarily from the primitive\ncausal powers of the elements and their spatial relations\u2014this\nis a \u2019bottom up\u2019 atomist principle., and presupposes that\nthe parts retain their identity within composites. But without this\ncore idea in (4), it is difficult to see how there can be\n\u2018closure under physics\u2019, for if the atoms did not retain\ntheir identity, how could the nomic structure that rests on them be\npreserved?\n\nThere seems to be, therefore, a tension between two principles the\nmodern hylomorphists seem to want to preserve. The tension is between\nthe role of form as the creator of a genuine, non-conventional unity\nin composites, and an openness to the modern belief in the closure of\nthe world under physics.\n\nMarmodoro\u2019s concern about Aristotelian unity also indicates a\ndifference between hylomorphism and the actual nature of substances,\nnamely concerning the vagueness that attaches to most of our substance\nconcepts. For most of our concepts, there are paradigm cases, but also\nmarginal cases. This is an almost inevitable consequence of taking\nseriously the atomic constitution of objects, for there will be no\nvery neat constraints on how they might combine. There are many\ntheories about how one should react to vagueness, but one of the most\ncommon and intuitive is to say that it is a conceptual\nmatter\u2014reality itself cannot be vague. This tends against a\nrealist and in favour of a conceptualist approach to our substance\nconcepts: if our macro\u2013substance concepts are prone to\nvagueness, and if vagueness is a sign that the concept in question is\nnot to be taken in a realist fashion, then Locke would be right that\nwhat we normally regard as substances are just our ways of classifying\nthings.\n\nThis conceptualist approach is reinforced if one accepts both what has\nbeen called the Eleatic Principle, namely that something can be a\nreal, concrete entity only if it has causal powers of its own, and,\nthat the physical world is \u201cclosed under physics\u201d. The\nlatter entails that only the entities of physics influence the\ndistribution and motion of matter, so that higher-order entities,\nthough they may figure in essential forms of explanation, have no\ninfluence on that on which everything physical supervenes. Applying\nthe Eleatic Principle to this, macro \u201centities\u201d are not\nreal in the way that anything worth calling hylomorphism, in the\nAristotelian tradition, requires (Robinson 2016: Part II).\n",
