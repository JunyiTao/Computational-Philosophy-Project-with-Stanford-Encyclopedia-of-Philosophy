    "main_text": "Pre-systematic conceptions of language in Vedic texts\n1. Pre-systematic conceptions of language in Vedic texts\n\nThe Vedic scriptural texts (1500\u2013500 bce)\nconsist of the four ancient collections, i.e.,\nthe \u1e5agveda, the S\u0101maveda, the\nYajurveda, and the Atharvaveda. The next layer of\nVedic texts, the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, consists of prose\nritual commentaries that offer procedures, justifications, and\nexplanations. The last two categories of Vedic literature are the\n\u0100ra\u1e47yakas, \u201cForest Texts\u201d, and the\nUpani\u1e63ads, \u201cSecret Mystical Doctrines\u201d.\n\nThe word sa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta is not known as a label of a\nlanguage variety during the Vedic period. The general term used for\nlanguage in the Vedic texts is v\u0101k, a word historically\nrelated to \u201cvoice\u201d. The Vedic poet-sages perceived\nsignificant differences between their own language and the languages\nof the outsiders. Similarly, they perceived important differences\nbetween their own use of language in mundane contexts and the use of\nlanguage directed toward Gods. The Gods are generically referred to by\nthe term deva, and the language of the hymns is said to be\ndev\u012b v\u0101k, \u201cdivine language.\u201d\nThis language is believed to have been created by the Gods themselves.\nThe language thus created by the Gods is then spoken by the animate\nworld in various forms. The divine language in its ultimate form is so\nmysterious that three-quarters of it are said to be hidden from the\nhumans who have access only to a quarter of it. The Vedic poet-sages\nsay that this divine language enters into their hearts and that they\ndiscover it through mystical introspection. Just as the language used\nby the Vedic poet-sages is the divine language, the language used by\nthe non-Vedic people is said to be un-godly (adev\u012b) or\ndemonic (asury\u0101).\n\nIn the Vedic literature, one observes the development of mystical and\nritual approaches to language. Language was perceived as an essential\ntool for approaching the gods, invoking them, asking their favors, and\nthus for the successful completion of a ritual performance. While the\nGods were the powers that finally yielded the wishes of their human\nworshipers, one could legitimately look at the resulting reward as\nensuing from the power of the religious language, or the power of the\nperforming priest. This way, the language came to be looked upon as\nhaving mysterious creative powers, and as a divine power that needed\nto be propitiated before it could be successfully used to invoke other\ngods. This approach to language ultimately led to deification of\nlanguage and the emergence of the Goddess of Speech (v\u0101k\ndev\u012b), and a number of other gods who are called\n\u201cLord of Speech\u201d (brahma\u1e47aspati,\nb\u1e5bhaspati, v\u0101kpati).\n\nIn contrast with the valorous deeds of the divine language, the\nlanguage of the non-Vedic people neither yields fruit nor blossom\n(\u1e5agveda, 10.71.5). \u201cYielding fruit and\nblossom\u201d is a phrase indicative of the creative power of speech\nthat produces the rewards for the worshiper. From being a created but\ndivine entity, the speech rises to the heights of being a divinity in\nher own right and eventually to becoming the substratum of the\nexistence of the whole universe. The deification of speech is seen in\nhymn 10.125 of the \u1e5agveda where the Goddess of Speech\nsings her own glory. In this hymn, one no longer hears of the creation\nof the speech, but one begins to see the speech as a primordial\ndivinity that creates and controls other gods, sages, and the human\nbeings. Here the goddess of speech demands worship in her own right,\nbefore her powers may be used for other purposes. The mystery of\nlanguage is comprehensible only to a special class of people, the wise\nBr\u0101hma\u1e47as, while the commoners have access to and\nunderstanding of only a limited portion of this transcendental\nphenomenon.\n\nThe \u201cLord of Speech\u201d divinities typically emerge as\ncreator divinities, e.g., Brahm\u0101,\nB\u1e5bhaspati, and Brahma\u1e47aspati, and the\nword brahman which earlier refers, with differing accents, to\nthe creative incantation and the priest, eventually comes to assume in\nthe Upani\u1e63ads the meaning of the creative force behind\nthe entire universe. While the Vedic hymns were looked upon as being\ncrafted by particular poet-sages in the earlier period, gradually a\nrising perception of their mysterious power and their preservation by\nthe successive generations led to the emergence of a new conception of\nthe scriptural texts. Already in the late parts of the\n\u1e5agveda (10.90.9), we hear that the verses\n(\u1e5bk), the songs (s\u0101ma), and the ritual\nformulas (yajus) arose from the primordial sacrifice offered\nby the gods. They arose from the sacrificed body of the cosmic person,\nthe ultimate ground of existence. This tendency of increasingly\nlooking at the scriptural texts as not being produced by any human\nauthors takes many forms in subsequent religious and philosophical\nmaterials, finally leading to a wide-spread notion that the Vedas are\nnot authored by any human beings (apauru\u1e63eya), and are\nin fact uncreated and eternal, beyond the cycles of creation and\ndestruction of the world. In late Vedic texts, we hear the notion that\nthe real Vedas are infinite (ananta) and that the Vedas known\nto human poet-sages are a mere fraction of the real infinite\nVedas.\n\nIn the late Vedic traditions of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, we\nare told that there is perfection of the ritual form\n(r\u016bpasam\u1e5bddhi) when a recited incantation echoes\nthe ritual action that is being performed. This shows a notion that\nideally there should be a match between the contents of a ritual\nformula and the ritual action in which it is recited, further\nsuggesting a notion that language mirrors the external world in some\nway. In the \u0100ra\u1e47yakas and\nUpani\u1e63ads, language acquires importance in different\nways. The Upani\u1e63ads, emphasizing the painful nature of\ncycles of rebirths, point out that the ideal goal should be to put an\nend to these cycles of birth and rebirth and to find one\u2019s permanent\nidentity with the original ground of the universal existence, i.e.,\nBrahman. The term brahman, originally referring to\ncreative ritual chants and the chanters, has now acquired this new\nmeaning, the ultimate creative force behind the universe. As part of\nthe meditative practice, one is asked to focus on the sacred syllable\nOM, which is the symbolic linguistic representation of Brahman. Here\nthe language, in the form of OM, becomes an important tool for the\nattainment of one\u2019s mystical union with Brahman. The Sanskrit word\nak\u1e63ara refers to a syllable, but it also means\n\u201cindestructible.\u201d Thus, the word ak\u1e63ara\nallowed the meditational use of the holy syllable OM to ultimately\nlead to one\u2019s experiential identity with the indestructible reality of\nBrahman.\n\nThe role of language and scripture in the Upani\u1e63adic mode of\nreligious life is complicated. Here, the use of language to invoke the\nVedic gods becomes a lower form of religious practice. Can Brahman be\nreached through language? Since Brahman is beyond all\ncharacterizations and all modes of human perception, no linguistic\nexpression can properly describe it. Hence all linguistic expressions\nand all knowledge framed in language are deemed to be inadequate for\nthe purpose of reaching Brahman. In fact, it is silence that\ncharacterizes Brahman, and not words. Even so, the use of OM-focused\nmeditation is emphasized, at least in the pre-final stages of\nBrahman-realization.\n\nBy the time we come to the classical philosophical systems in India,\none more assumption is made by almost all Hindu systems, i.e., that\nall the Vedas together form a coherent whole. The human authorship of\nthe Vedic texts has long been rejected, and they are now perceived\neither as being entirely uncreated and eternal or created by God at\nthe beginning of each cycle of creation. Under the assumption that\nthey are entirely uncreated, their innate ability to convey truthful\nmeaning is unhampered by human limitations. Thus if all the Vedic\ntexts convey truth, there cannot be any internal contradictions. If an\nomniscient God, who by his very nature is compassionate and beyond\nhuman limitations, created the Vedas, one reaches the same conclusion,\ni.e., there cannot be any internal contradictions. The traditional\ninterpretation of the Vedas proceeds under these assumptions. If there\nare seeming contradictions in Vedic passages, the burden of finding\nways to remove those seeming contradictions is upon the interpreter,\nbut there can be no admission of internal contradictions in the texts\nthemselves.\n",
