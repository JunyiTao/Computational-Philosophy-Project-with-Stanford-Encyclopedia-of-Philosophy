    "main_text": "Ethics || Happiness\n7.1 Happiness\n\nThe basic structure of Augustine\u2019s ethics is that of ancient\neudaimonism (Holte 1962), but he defers happiness to the afterlife and\nblames the ancient ethicists for their arrogant\nconviction\u2014resulting from their ignorance of the fallen\ncondition of humankind\u2014that they could reach happiness in this\nlife by philosophical endeavor (De civitate dei 19.4;\nWolterstorff 2012; for a more optimistic view, cf. the early De\nordine 2.26). He takes it as axiomatic that happiness is the\nultimate goal pursued by all human beings (e.g., De beata\nvita 10; De civitate dei 10.1; De trinitate\n13.7, quoting Cicero\u2019s Hortensius; for an interesting\ndiscussion of how the desire for happiness relates to our equally\nnatural desires for pleasure and for truth cf. Confessiones\n10.29\u201334; Matthews 2005: 134\u2013145; Menn 2014: 80\u201395).\nHappiness or the good life is brought about by the possession of the\ngreatest good in nature that humans can attain and that one cannot\nlose against one\u2019s will (e.g., lib. arb. 1.10\u201312;\nespecially in his early work Augustine shares the Stoics\u2019\nconcern about the self-sufficiency and independence of the wise and\nhappy person, cf. Wetzel 1992, 42\u201355). This structure Augustine\ninscribes into his Neoplatonically inspired three-tiered ontological\nhierarchy (Letter 18.2)\n and concludes that the only thing able to fulfil the requirements for\nthe supreme good set by eudaimonism is the immutable God himself. The\nSupreme Being is also the greatest good; the desire of created being\nfor happiness can only be satisfied by the creator. As Augustine puts\nin concisely in De beata vita (11): \u201cHappy is he who\nhas God\u201d. Alternative formulations are \u201cenjoyment of\nGod\u201d (De civitate dei 8.8; De trinitate\n13.10), \u201ccontemplation of God\u201d or \u201cenjoyment of\ntruth\u201d (De libero arbitrio 2.35). To \u201chave\u201d\nGod means in fact to know and, especially, to love God; Augustine\ntherefore interprets Psalm 72:28 (\u201cFor me it is good to cling to\nGod\u201d) as a biblical telos formula or definition of the\nsupreme and beatifying good (De civitate dei 10.18; Tornau\n2015: 265\u2013266). We are, in other words, happy, wise and virtuous\nif we turn to or \u201cconvert\u201d to God. If we turn away from\nhim and direct our attention and love to the bodies\u2014which are\nnot per se bad, as in Manicheism, but an infinitely lesser good than\nGod\u2014or to ourselves, who are a great good but still subordinate\nto God, we become miserable, foolish and wicked (Letter 18.2;\nDe libero arbitrio 2.52\u201354; In Iohannis evangelium\ntractatus 20.11). Virtue is \u201clove that knows its\npriorities\u201d (ordo amoris, De civitate dei 15.22)\nwhereas vice or sin perverts the natural order. Just as after the Fall\nall human beings are inevitably tainted by sin, we need to be purified\nthrough faith in order to live well and to restore our ability to know\nand love God (De diversis quaestionibus 68.3; Cary 2008a:\n12\u201313). Augustine does not discard the intellectual element\ninherited from the ancient (Socratic) ethical tradition, and his\nnotion of conversion is certainly inspired by Neoplatonist\n\u201creturn\u201d (epistrophe), but Augustine enhances the\nethical relevance of conversion and aversion by emphasizing their\nvoluntary character (cf. already De immortalitate animae\n11\u201312).\n The element of will or love is also crucial to the distinction between\n\u201cenjoyment\u201d (frui) and \u201cuse\u201d\n(uti) that is first fully developed in De doctrina\nchristiana, bk. 1 (c. 396) and remains basic for his ethical\nthought. Following the ancient insight that we pursue some goods for\ntheir own sake and others for the sake of other and greater goods,\nAugustine states that to \u201cenjoy\u201d a thing means to cling to\nit with love for its own sake whereas to \u201cuse\u201d it means to\nlove it for the sake of another thing which we want to enjoy. We love\nabsolutely only what we enjoy, whereas our love for things we use is\nrelative and even instrumental (De doctrina christiana 1.4).\nThe only proper object of enjoyment is God (cf. De civitate\ndei 8.8 where the same view is attributed to the Platonists).\nWickedness and confusion of the moral order results from a reversal of\nuse and enjoyment, when we want to enjoy what we ought to use (all\ncreated things, e.g., wealth, bodies or ourselves) and to use what we\nought to enjoy (this probably refers to the \u201ccarnal\u201d\nunderstanding of religion of which Augustine often accuses the Jews).\nAn obvious problem of this system is the categorization of the\nbiblically prescribed love of the neighbor. Are we to enjoy our\nneighbor or to use her? Whereas natural moral intuition suggests the\nformer, Augustine\u2019s systematic seems to require the latter. The\nproblem is inherited from ancient eudaimonism, where it takes some\nphilosophical effort to reconcile the intuition that concern for\nothers is morally relevant with the assumption that ethics is\nprimarily about the virtue and happiness of the individual. Augustine\nis aware of the problem and gives a differentiated answer. In De\ndoctrina christiana (1.20\u201321) he somewhat tentatively\nsuggests that to love our neighbor means to use him, not because he is\nmerely instrumental to our happiness but because we are enjoined to\nlove him as ourselves and because we love ourselves rightly only if we\nrefer our self-love to our desire to enjoy God. Love of the neighbor\nthus means to desire his true happiness in the same way as we desire\nour own. In substance, this remains Augustine\u2019s view also in his\nlater work (cf., e.g., In epistulam Iohannis ad Parthos tractatus\ndecem 1.9), but he then prefers to avoid the counter-intuitive\nand potentially misleading talk about \u201cusing\u201d fellow\nhumans and replaces it by a description of fraternal love as\n\u201cmutual enjoyment in God\u201d (e.g., De trinitate\n9.13; cf. already De doctrina christiana 1.35; 3.16; Rist\n1994: 159\u2013168; O\u2019Donovan 1980: 32\u201336;\n112\u2013136). \u201cIn God\u201d is presumably added to prevent\nthe misunderstanding that we are to enjoy the neighbor \u201cin\nherself\u201d or \u201cin ourselves\u201d without reference to God.\nThis would mean that we expect our true happiness from her, which no\nhuman can give; the result of this misdirection would be extreme\nmisery in the case of the neighbor\u2019s loss (cf.\nConfessiones 4.9\u201311 on Augustine\u2019s excessive\ngrief after the death of his friend; Nawar 2014).\n",
