    "main_text": "Philosophy of Physics || Quantum Mechanics and 3-Valued Logic\n4.5 Quantum Mechanics and 3-Valued Logic\n\nReichenbach\u2019s discussion of quantum mechanics contains a (then)\nstandard presentation of the formalism of the theory, including the\nBorn rule and, without stating it, the Projection Postulate (see the\nentry on\n quantum mechanics).\n It is marked, however, by Reichenbach\u2019s empiricism about\nmeaning, by his frequency interpretation of probability, by a\nthree-valued \u201cquantum logic\u201d and by a curious neglect of\nthe major problems and of some the most important previous\nfoundational literature. For later philosophical readers, the missing\npiece in Reichenbach\u2019s discussion of the theory is the\nmeasurement problem (see the section on the measurement problem in the\nentry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory):\n he gives no account of how the dynamical equation of the theory can\naccount for uncorrelated measurement and object systems becoming\ncorrelated in a measurement interaction. \n\nThere was a considerable history of \u201cquantum logics\u201d\nbefore Reichenbach\u2019s work (see the entry on\n quantum logic).\n Martin Strauss had published a theory similar in spirit, but not in\ndetail, to Kochen and Speckers\u2019 partial Boolean algebras (which\nappeared only thirty years later; see the entry on the\n Kochen-Specker theorem),\n characterized by the fact that propositional connectives were allowed\nonly among simultaneously \u201cverifiable\u201d propositions.\nReichenbach objects that some quantum mechanical propositions whose\nlogical form contains no propositional operators may be unverifiable.\nPaulette Fevrier had also introduced a three-valued logic, to which\nReichenbach makes a similar objection. Strikingly absent is any\nreference to Birkhoff and von Neumann\u2019s 1936 paper on the\nlogical structure of quantum mechanics, which introduces a logical\nstructure for orthocomplemented lattices and projective geometries. We\ncan scarcely believe Reichenbach did not know of it and the neglect is\ndifficult to explain. Reichenbach seems to know of everything else,\nand he was in correspondence with Bargmann at the Institute for\nAdvanced Study. Reichenbach cites von Neumann\u2019s Mathematical\nFoundations of Quantum Mechanics (1932), but only with regard to\nvon Neumann\u2019s no hidden variable theorem (see the entry\non\n quantum logic\n and the section on the measurement problem in the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory).\n\nReichenbach\u2019s quantum logic has three values, True,\nIndeterminate, and False. Indeterminate is\nthe value of propositions that quantum theory implies cannot be\nassessed to be either true or false. Three unary propositional\nfunctions are defined, one corresponding to classical negation, as\nwell as seven binary functions, including classical disjunction,\nconjunction and equivalence. \n\nReichenbach gives no axiomatization and no rules of inference\n(although passages suggest he intended an analog of modus ponens to\nhold for his two new conditional functions) and of course he therefore\nprovides neither soundness nor completeness theorems. Nor does he\ncharacterize the class of functions that may be defined by composition\nof his propositional functions. He does derive various properties of\nthe new connectives from their definitions. \n\nReichenbach was quite explicit that logic is not empirical. \u201cThe\nrules of logic cannot be affected by physical experience.\u201d (p.\n102). His logic with Indeterminate as a value of propositions\nis the same as logic with \u201cnot empirically meaningful\u201d as\na value. In Reichenbach\u2019s view that is the logic, as it\nwere, with or without quantum mechanics. It is only that, before\nquantum mechanics, the principle of equivalent descriptions precluded\nany need to pay attention to the Indeterminate value. \n",
