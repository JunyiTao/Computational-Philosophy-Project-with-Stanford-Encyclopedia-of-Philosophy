    "main_text": "Conclusion || The Sublunary World: Matter and Evil\n6.3 Concluding Remarks\n\nHence, through the concept of emanation, Avicenna explains the\nGod-world relationship and, more generally, efficient causality. The\ncausality of motion (ta\u1e25r\u012bk) and of influence\n(ta\u02bea\u1e6f\u1e6fur) are both added to and subsumed\nunder the causality of emanation, which is sustained by the ideas of\nboth donation and reception. With his metaphysics Avicenna provides a\nfoundation for every level of his theory: physics and then psychology,\ngnoseology or epistemology, prophecy (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, X,\n2\u20133) and even eschatology (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 7;\nMichot 1986) find their ultimate explanation in the metaphysical\nconcept of the flow of forms. Consequently, if the\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t of the Kit\u0101b\nal-\u0160if\u0101\u02be and the metaphysical parts of the other\nsummae (Salvation, Remarks, Science, Guidance)\ntogether with the Kit\u0101b al-Ta\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t\n(The Book of Notes) and other writings like the\nKit\u0101b al-Mabda\u02be wa-l-ma\u02bf\u0101d (The Book of\nProvenance and Destination), are essential to the study of\nmetaphysics, it is no exaggeration to state that every work Avicenna\ndevoted to philosophy can be relevant to the understanding of his\nmetaphysical ideas and that metaphysical works clarify the other parts\nof Avicenna\u2019s system: metaphysics is omni-comprehensive.\n",
