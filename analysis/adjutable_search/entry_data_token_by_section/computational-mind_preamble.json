    "main_text": "\nCould a machine think? Could the mind itself be a thinking machine?\nThe computer revolution transformed discussion of these questions,\noffering our best prospects yet for machines that emulate reasoning,\ndecision-making, problem solving, perception, linguistic\ncomprehension, and other mental processes. Advances in\ncomputing raise the prospect that the mind itself is a computational\nsystem\u2014a position known as the computational theory of\nmind (CTM). Computationalists are researchers who\nendorse CTM, at least as applied to certain important mental\nprocesses. CTM played a central role within cognitive science during\nthe 1960s and 1970s. For many years, it enjoyed orthodox status. More\nrecently, it has come under pressure from various rival paradigms. A\nkey task facing computationalists is to explain what one means when\none says that the mind \u201ccomputes\u201d. A second task is to\nargue that the mind \u201ccomputes\u201d in the relevant sense. A\nthird task is to elucidate how computational description relates to\nother common types of description, especially neurophysiological\ndescription (which cites neurophysiological properties of the\norganism\u2019s brain or body) and intentional description\n(which cites representational properties of mental states).\n",
