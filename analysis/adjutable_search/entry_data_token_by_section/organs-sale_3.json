    "main_text": "The Case for Organ Sale || The Saving of Lives\n2.2 The Saving of Lives\n\n\nThis argument is straightforward. Permitting (or encouraging)\norgan sale will, it is claimed, save lives by (at least partially)\nalleviating the shortage of transplant organs. The saving of\nlives is a good end and organ sale is then defensible as a means of\nachieving that positive end.\n\n\nThe shortage of transplant organs is a major worldwide public health\nproblem.  According to the US Department of Health and Human Services\nOrgan Procurement and Transplantation Network, there are approximately\n123,000 patients on transplant waiting lists in the US and around\n300,000 patients waiting for an organ transplant in China (The\nEconomist 2014). In the US in 2014, the overall median waiting time\nfor a kidney transplant was over three and a half years (National\nKidney Foundation 2014).  The situation is similar in the UK\n(Department of Health 2014). Furthermore, waiting list sizes do not\neven fully reflect the actual level of need because doctors are\nsometimes reluctant even to list patients who they feel do not stand a\nrealistic chance of getting an organ in\ntime. (see Other Internet Resources section\nbelow).\n\n\nOpposition to the Saving of Lives Argument takes one of two\nforms. It may be objected to empirically, with the critic arguing\neither that permitting organ sale would be ineffective or that an\nalternative system would work better: for example, the ways in which we\napproach bereaved relatives could be improved, as could the ways in\nwhich the possibility of (unpaid) living donation is publicized, or\nthere could be a move to a Mandated Choice or Presumed Consent\nsystem (Hinkley 2005). Alternatively, one might concede\nthe empirical point that allowing organ sale would be an effective\noption, but nonetheless argue that there are sufficiently strong\ncountervailing (moral or practical) reasons to justify leaving the\nprohibition on sale in place. These reasons are the subject of\nsome later sections.\n\n\nThe Saving of Lives Argument (unless rejected on empirical grounds)\nhas an important role in placing the onus of proof on the shoulders of\nthe prohibitionists (those who wish organ sale to be banned). For\ngiven that this prohibition may, in effect, be causing deaths (or at\nleast preventing the saving of lives) a strong reason to continue with\nit will be required.\n",
