Cosmology in the Revival of the Religious Sciences\n\nDespite his declared reluctance to enter into theological discussions,\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee addresses in his Revival important\nphilosophical problems related to human actions. In the 35th book on\n\u201cBelief in Divine Unity and Trust in God\u201d (Kit\u00e2b\nal-Tawh\u00eed wa-l-tawakkul) he discusses the relationship\nbetween human actions and God\u2019s omnipotence as creator of the\nworld. In this and other books of the Revival\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee teaches a strictly determinist position with\nregard to events in the universe. God creates and determines\neverything, including the actions of humans. God is the only\n\u201cagent\u201d or the only \u201cefficient cause\u201d\n(f\u00e2\u2019il, the Arabic term means both) in the world.\nEvery event in creation follows a pre-determined plan that is\neternally present in God\u2019s knowledge. God\u2019s knowledge\nexists in a timeless realm and does not contain individual\n\u201ccognitions\u201d (\u2018ul\u00fbm) like human\nknowledge does. God\u2019s knowledge does not change, for instance,\nwhen its object, the world, changes. While the events that are\ncontained in God\u2019s knowledge are ordered in \u201cbefore\u201d\nand \u201cafter\u201d, there is no past, present, and future.\nGod\u2019s knowledge contains the first moment of creation just as\nthe last, and He knows \u201cin His eternity,\u201d for instance,\nwhether a certain individual will end up in paradise or hell (Griffel\n2009, 175\u2013213).\n\nFor all practical purposes it befits humans to assume that God\ncontrols everything through chains of causes (Marmura 1965,\n193\u201396). We witness in nature causal processes that add up to\nlonger causal chains. Would we be able to follow a causal chain like\nan \u201cinquiring wayfarer\u201d (s\u00e2lik\ns\u00e2\u2019il), who follows a chain of events to its origin,\nwe would be led through causal processes in the sub-lunar sphere, the\n\u201cworld of dominion\u201d (\u2018\u00e2lam al-mulk),\nfurther to causes that exist in the celestial spheres, the\n\u201cworld of sovereignty\u201d (\u2018\u00e2lam\nal-malak\u00fbt), until we would finally reach the highest\ncelestial intellect, which is caused by the being beyond it, God\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 13:2497\u2013509 = 2001,\n15\u201333; see also idem 1964a, 220\u201321). God is the starting\npoint of all causal chains and He creates and controls all elements\ntherein. God is \u201cthe one who makes the causes function as\ncauses\u201d (musabbib al-asb\u00e2b) (Frank 1992, 18).\n\nGod\u2019s \u201ccausal\u201d determination of all events also\nextends to human actions. Every human action is caused by the\nperson\u2019s volition, which is caused by a certain motive\n(d\u00e2\u2019iya). The person\u2019s volition and motive\nare, in turn, caused by the person\u2019s convictions and his or her\nknowledge (\u2018ilm). Human knowledge is caused by various\nfactors, like one\u2019s experience of the world, one\u2019s\nknowledge of revelation, or the books one has read\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 13:2509\u201311 = 2001,\n34\u201337). There is no single event in this world that is not\ndetermined by God\u2019s will. While humans are under the impression\nthat they have a free will, their actions are in reality compelled by\ncauses that exist within them as well as outside (Griffel 2009,\n213\u201334).\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee viewed the world as a conglomerate of\nconnections that are all pre-determined and meticulously planned in\nGod\u2019s timeless knowledge. God creates the universe as a huge\napparatus and employs it in order to pursue a certain goal\n(qasd). In two of his later works al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\ncompares the universe with a water-clock. Here he describes three\nstages of its creation. The builder of the water-clock first has to\nmake a plan of it, secondly execute this plan and build the clock, and\nthirdly he has to make the clock going by supplying it with a constant\nsource of energy, namely the flow of water. That energy needs to be\ncarefully measured, because only the right amount of energy will\nproduce the desired result. In God\u2019s creation of the universe\nthese three stages are called judgment (hukm), decree\n(qad\u00e2\u2019), and pre-destination (qadar)\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1971, 98\u2013102; 1964a, 12\u201314). God\ndesigns the universe in His timeless knowledge, puts it into being at\none point in time, and provides it with a constant and well-measured\nsupply of \u201cbeing\u201d (wuj\u00fbd). According to\nAvicenna\u2019s explanation of creation\u2014which\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee was not opposed to\u2014\u201cbeing\u201d is\npassed down from God to the first and ontologically highest creation\nand from there in a chain of secondary efficient causes to all other\nexistents. It is important to acknowledge, however, that God is the\nonly true efficient cause (f\u00e2\u2019il) in this chain.\nHe is the only \u201cagent,\u201d all other beings are merely\nemployed in His service (Griffel 2009, 236\u201353).\n\nNature is a process in which all elements harmoniously dovetail with\none another. Celestial movements, natural processes, human actions,\neven redemption in the afterlife are all \u201ccausally\u201d\ndetermined. Whether we will be rewarded or punished in the afterlife\ncan be understood, according to al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee, as the mere\ncausal effect of our actions in this world. In the 32nd book of his\nRevival al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee explains how knowing the\nQur\u2019an causes the conviction (i\u2019tiq\u00e2d) that\none is punished for bad deeds, and how that conviction may cause\nsalvation in the afterlife:\n\n\u2026and the conviction [that some humans will be punished] is a\ncause (sabab) for the setting in of fear, and the setting in\nof fear is a cause for abandoning the passions and retreating from the\nabode of delusions. This is a cause for arriving at the vicinity of\nGod, and God is the one who makes the causes function as causes\n(musabbib al-asb\u00e2b) and who arranges them\n(murattibuh\u00e2). These causes have been made easy for\nhim, who has been predestined in eternity to earn redemption, so that\nthrough their chaining-together the causes will lead him to paradise.\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 11:2225.)\n\n\nAll these are teachings that are very close to those of Avicenna\n(Frank 1992, 24\u201325). Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee also followed\nAvicenna in his conviction that this universe is the best of all\npossible worlds and that \u201cthere is in possibility nothing more\nwondrous than what is\u201d (laysa f\u00ee-l-imk\u00e2n\nabda\u2019 mimm\u00e2 k\u00e2n) (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\n1937\u201338, 13:2515\u201318 = 2001, 47\u201350). This led to a\nlong-lasting debate among later Muslim theologians about what is meant\nby this sentence and whether al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee is, in fact, right\n(Ormsby 1984). It must be stressed, however, that contrary to\nAvicenna\u2014and contrary to Frank\u2019s (1992, 55\u201363)\nunderstanding of him\u2014al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee firmly held that God\nexercises a genuine free will and that when He creates, He chooses\nbetween alternatives. God\u2019s will is not in any way determined by\nGod\u2019s nature or essence. God\u2019s will is the undetermined\ndeterminator of everything in this world.\n",
