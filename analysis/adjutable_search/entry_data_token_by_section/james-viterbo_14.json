    "main_text": "Ethics || Love of Self vs. Love of God\n8. Political Thought\n\nAlthough James touches briefly on political issues in Quodl.\nI, q. 17 (see Kempshall, 1999, and C\u00f4t\u00e9, 2012), his most\nextensive discussions occur in his celebrated De regimine\nchristiano (On Christian Government), written in 1302\nduring the conflict pitting Boniface VIII against the king of France\nPhilip IV (the Fair). De regimine christiano is often\ncompared in aim and content with Giles of Rome\u2019s De\necclesiastica potestate (On Ecclesiastical Power), which\noffers one of the most extreme statements of pontifical supremacy in\nthe thirteenth century; indeed, in the words of De\nregimine\u2019s editor, James\u2019 goal is \u201cto formulate\na theory of papal monarchy that is every bit as imposing and ambitious\nas that of [Giles]\u201d (De regimine christiano: xxxiv).\nHowever, as scholars have also recognized, James shows a greater\nsensitivity to the distinction between nature and grace than Giles did\n(Arquilli\u00e8re 1926).\u00a0\n\nDe regimine christiano is divided into two parts. The first,\ndealing with the theory of the Church, is of little philosophical\ninterest, save for James\u2019 enlisting of Aristotle to show that\nall human communities, including the Church, are rooted in the\n\u201cnatural inclination of mankind.\u201d The second and longest\npart is devoted to defining the nature and extent of Christ\u2019s\nand the pope\u2019s power. One of James\u2019 most characteristic\ndoctrines is found in Book II, chapter 7, where he turns to the\nquestion of whether temporal power must be \u201cinstituted\u201d by\nspiritual power, in other words, whether it derives its legitimacy\nfrom the spiritual, or possesses a legitimacy of its own. James states\noutright that spiritual power does institute temporal power, but notes\nthat there have been two views in this regard. Some, e. g., the\nproponents of the so-called \u201cdualist\u201d position such as\nJohn Quidort of Paris, hold that the temporal power derives directly\nfrom God and thus in no way needs to be instituted by the spiritual,\nwhile others, such as Giles of Rome in De ecclesiastica\npotestate, contend that the temporal derives wholly from the\nspiritual and is devoid of any legitimacy whatsoever \u201cunless it\nis united with spiritual power in the same person or instituted by the\nspiritual power\u201d (De regimine christiano: 211).\n\nJames is dissatisfied with both positions and, as he so often does,\nendeavors to find a \u201cmiddle way\u201d between them. His\nsolution is to say that the \u201cbeing\u201d of the temporal\npower\u2019s institution comes both from God\u2014by way of\nman\u2019s natural inclination\u2014in \u201ca material and\nincomplete sense,\u201d and from the spiritual power by which it is\n\u201cperfected and formed.\u201d This is a very clever solution. On\nthe one hand, by rooting the temporal power in man\u2019s natural\ninclination, albeit in the imperfect sense just mentioned, James was\nacknowledging the legitimacy of temporal rule independently of its\nconnection to the spiritual, thus \u201cavoid[ing] the extreme and\nimplausible view of [Giles of Rome]\u201d (Dyson 2009: xxix). On the\nother hand, making the natural origins of temporal power merely the\nincomplete matter of its being was a way of stressing its\nsubordination and inferiority to the spiritual order, in keeping with\nhis papalist convictions. Still, James\u2019 very choice of analogies\nto illustrate the relationship between the spiritual and temporal\nrealms showed that his solution lay much closer to the theocratic\nposition espoused by Giles of Rome than his efforts to find a\n\u201cmiddle way\u201d would have us believe. Thus, comparing the\nspiritual power\u2019s relation to the temporal in terms of the\nrelation of light to color, he explains that although \u201ccolor has\nsomething of the nature of light, (\u2026) it has such a feeble\nlight that, unless there is present a more excellent light by which it\nmay be formed, not in its own nature but in its power, it cannot move\nthe vision\u201d (De regimine christiano: 211). In other\nwords, James is telling us that although temporal power does originate\nin man\u2019s natural inclinations, it is ineffectual qua power\nunless it is informed by the spiritual.\n",
