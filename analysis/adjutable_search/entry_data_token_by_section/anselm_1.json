This motto lends itself to at\nleast two misunderstandings. First, many philosophers have taken it to\nmean that Anselm hopes to replace faith with understanding.\nIf one takes \u2018faith\u2019 to mean roughly \u2018belief on the\nbasis of testimony\u2019 and \u2018understanding\u2019 to mean\n\u2018belief on the basis of philosophical insight\u2019, one is\nlikely to regard faith as an epistemically substandard position; any\nself-respecting philosopher would surely want to leave faith behind as\nquickly as possible. The theistic proofs are then interpreted as the\nmeans by which we come to have philosophical insight into things we\npreviously believed solely on testimony. But Anselm is not hoping to\nreplace faith with understanding. Faith for Anselm is more a\nvolitional state than an epistemic state: it is love for God and a\ndrive to act as God wills. In fact, Anselm describes the sort of faith\nthat \u201cmerely believes what it ought to believe\u201d as\n\u201cdead\u201d (M 78). (For the abbreviations used in\nreferences, see the Bibliography below.) So \u201cfaith seeking\nunderstanding\u201d means something like \u201can active love of God\nseeking a deeper knowledge of God.\u201d\n\nOther philosophers have noted that \u201cfaith seeking\nunderstanding\u201d begins with \u201cfaith,\u201d not with doubt\nor suspension of belief.  Hence, they argue, the theistic\narguments proposed by faith seeking understanding are not really meant\nto convince unbelievers; they are intended solely for the edification\nof those who already believe.  This too is a misreading of\nAnselm\u2019s motto. For although the theistic proofs are borne of an\nactive love of God seeking a deeper knowledge of the beloved, the\nproofs themselves are intended to be convincing even to unbelievers.\nThus Anselm opens the Monologion with these words:\n\nIf anyone does not know, either because he has not heard or because he\ndoes not believe, that there is one nature, supreme among all existing\nthings, who alone is self-sufficient in his eternal happiness, who\nthrough his omnipotent goodness grants and brings it about that all\nother things exist or have any sort of well-being, and a great many\nother things that we must believe about God or his creation, I think\nhe could at least convince himself of most of these things by reason\nalone, if he is even moderately intelligent. (M 1)\n\n\nAnd in the Proslogion Anselm sets out to convince \u201cthe\nfool,\u201d that is, the person who \u201chas said in his heart,\n\u2018There is no God\u2019 \u201d (Psalm 14:1; 53:1).\n",
