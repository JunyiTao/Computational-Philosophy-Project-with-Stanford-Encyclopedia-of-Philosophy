    "main_text": "Temporal Passage\n8. Relativistic Physics\n\nIn preceding sections, we examined problems facing presentism that\ncome from metaphysical quarters. In particular, we looked at a problem\nof \u201ccross-temporal relations\u201d\n (\u00a74),\n and discussed two instances of that general problem, which pose\nspecial problems for presentism (\u00a7\u00a75\u20136), before\nexamining a related challenge concerning temporal passage. Now, though\nthere are many worries for presentism that come from metaphysics,\nperhaps the most serious objection to presentism comes from physics.\nIn particular, the special theory of relativity (\u201cSTR\u201d)\nhas been presented as in direct tension with presentism. [See the\nentry on\n being and becoming in modern physics.]\n\nSimon Saunders (2002) gives us a clear picture of how things\nsupposedly stand with respect to presentism and STR, as follows:\n\n\nAccording to presentism, all that is physically real is the\npresent\u2014a system of physical events all of which are\nsimultaneous with each other. No other events are real. Precisely what\nthis system of events may be, now, as I snap my fingers, may not be\nknown to me; but there is a fact of the matter as to what it is, and\nit is a universal fact which embraces us all. It is an intersubjective\nreality\u2014now, as a snap my fingers\u2014and it is a reality\nwhich contains us only as an incidental part. But even if one knew all\nthat there is to know, consistent with special relativity, one would\nnot be able to say what this system of events might be. According to\npresentism, therefore, special relativity is radically deficient as a\ndescription of reality. It is blind to the sequencing of what is\nphysically real. (2002: 279\u201380)\n\n\nA quick and dirty reply on behalf of presentism is to suggest that\nmetaphysics and science are, in some sense, demarcated disciplines.\nThat is, the findings of physics are of no relevance to our best\nmetaphysics (and vice versa). But this doesn\u2019t seem to be a move\nthat we should make. Both metaphysicians and physicists are, surely,\ntrying to uncover the structure of the world and to theorize about the\nnature of reality (fundamental or otherwise). To ignore one another is\nno way for protagonists to carry on when both aim at the same basic\ngoal. Of course, this means that we must say something in reply to\nSaunders and others, who raise the same sort of objection (e.g.,\nPutnam 1967; Stein 1968, 1970; Savitt 1994, 2000; Sider 2001:\n42\u201352; W\u00fcthrich 2013; cf. Emery 2019, 2021). But what can\nbe said?\n\nKatherine Hawley (2006) suggests two routes: \u201cUndermining\u201d\nor \u201cCounterargument\u201d (we introduce each in turn). Suppose\nthat, as seems to be the case in the debate concerning STR, we want to\nargue that some metaphysics, posited by science, is false. That is,\nthe science, as it\u2019s traditionally interpreted, delivers the\n\u201cwrong\u201d metaphysics. There are options (though, as Hawley\nnotes, it seems likely that any genuine attempt to respond to the\nobjection from relativity may require a little of each). First,\n\u201cUndermining\u201d:\n\n\nThis is the attempt to show that the scientific metaphysics is not\ninvolved in generating novel prediction, and thus that its appearance\nin a scientific theory does not give us reason to think it true.\n(2006: 463)\n\n\nAs Hawley notes, there\u2019s a second step to Undermining, since\nmerely establishing that the metaphysics implied by the traditional\ninterpretation of a scientific hypothesis isn\u2019t essential to the\nscientific theory, doesn\u2019t establish that the metaphysics with\nwhich we would seek to replace the scientific metaphysics is\npreferable. We need to do more than show that the metaphysics implied\nby traditional interpretation and the metaphysics that we prefer are\non a par. We need to show that the\n\u201cmetaphysically-supported\u201d metaphysics is on a stronger\nfooting than the \u201cscientifically-supported\u201d\nmetaphysics.\n\nUndermining is a strategy that a number of metaphysicians have\nplausibly looked to deploy, arguing that there are empirically\nequivalent theories that differ with respect to metaphysical\ncommitments, but yield the same predictions. For instance, see Craig\n(2001) and Markosian (2004); Zimmerman (2011) explores a range of\noptions.\n\nConsider a case: if a rod, R, is traveling in direction d and\nis observed by an observer, O, who is stationary with respect\nto R, then R will appear to be length l.\nIf, however, O is in motion with respect to R,\nmoving toward it, then the length of R will appear, to\nO, to be less than l. There are two competing\nexplanations we might give, a standard \u201cspace-time\u201d\ninterpretation, as well as a \u201cneo-Lorentzian\u201d\ninterpretation. (For philosophical defenders of the neo-Lorentzian\npicture, see Tooley 1997 and Craig 2001.)\u00a0As Balashov &\nJanssen (2003) have it:\n\n\n\u2026the space-time interpretation and the neo-Lorentzian\ninterpretation provide constructive theory explanations. In the\nspace-time interpretation, the model is Minkowski space-time and\nlength contraction is explained by showing that two observers who are\nin relative motion to one another and therefore use different sets of\nspace-time axes disagree about which cross section of the\n\u201cworld-tube\u201d of a physical system give the length of the\nsystem. In the neo-Lorentzian interpretation, length contraction is\nexplained by a combination of dynamical effects of measurement. (2003:\n331)\n\n\nNow, to endorse this \u201cUndermining\u201d approach, we would have\nto say that the neo-Lorentzian account is preferable to the space-time\naccount. And, problematically, that looks to be false. The problem is\nas follows. There\u2019s an explanatory advantage to treating length\ncontraction as explained by geometric features of space-time, rather\nthan by a dynamically occurring process. This, as we see below, will\nrequire us to postulate an unexplained brute fact as to why length\ncontraction and time dilation appear in laws governing all matter.\nSince unexplained coincidences, or treating certain facts as\n\u201cbrute\u201d, is suboptimal (particularly when, as Balashov\n& Janssen argue (2003: 341\u20132), the space-time interpretation\noffers a better explanation\u2014one that does not treat Lorentz\ninvariance as brute or mysterious), so we ought to deny the\nneo-Lorentzian interpretation of relativity.\n\nLet\u2019s try to get a better sense of this. What\u2019s the brute\nfact required of us? And why should we worry about it? Why should we\nthink that the neo-Lorentzian theory, which is acknowledged to be\nempirically equivalent to STR (Balashov & Janssen 2003: 23;\nCallender 2008: 52\u201353), offers an inferior explanation of both\nlength contraction and time dilation than does STR? Janssen (2002)\nputs the point as follows:\n\n\nFor Einstein, the Lorentz-transformed quantities are the correctly\nmeasured real quantities. In the final version of Lorentz\u2019s\ntheory, measurements never reveal the real quantities because all\nmeasurements are made with devices that are systematically distorted\nand improperly synchronized as a result of their and the\nobserver\u2019s motion through the ether. (2002: 429)\n\n\nThus, where for Lorentz, \u201cLorentz-invariance\u201d is a product\nof a law governing the dynamical behavior of entities in motion, for\nEinstein, Lorentz-invariance is simply a product of the geometry of\nspace-time. As Balashov & Janssen go on to argue:\n\n\nCompare the status of Lorentz invariance in the two interpretations.\nIn the former, Lorentz invariance reflects the structure of space-time\nposited by the theory. In the latter, Lorentz invariance is a property\naccidentally shared by all laws effectively governing systems in\nNewtonian space and time\u2026In the neo-Lorentzian interpretation\nit is, in the final analysis, an unexplained coincidence that the laws\neffectively governing different sorts of matter all share the property\nof Lorentz invariance. (2003: 341)\n\n\nSo, here\u2019s the detail of the objection. Lorentz\u2019s theory\nwas born of Newtonian mechanics and Maxwellian electrodynamics\n(Janssen 2002: 423): the latter incorporated electric and magnetic\nfields, but made no pronouncements at all concerning other forms of\nmatter. Thus, although we can extend the Lorentzian theory to\nall laws governing matter, we have no reason to do so. It just happens\nto turn out that the laws governing matter all instantiate this\nproperty. Craig Callender (2008) makes the point clearly, as\nfollows:\n\n\nThe matter fields are Lorentz invariant but the space-time is not. For\nthis reason, all else being equal, one ought to prefer the Einstein\nMinkowski interpretation to the Lorentz interpretation. Positing\notherwise unnecessary unobservable structure\u2014absolute\nsimultaneity\u2014does violence to Ockham\u2019s razor. (2008:\n53)\n\n\nCallender goes on to point out that once we grant that the Lorentz\ninterpretation is logically consistent and empirically adequate, the\nquestion becomes, \u201c[w]hat are a few lost explanatory virtues in\ncontrast to _______ (fill in the blank with whatever tenses\nexplain)?\u201d (2008: 53). After all, we have to posit an\nunobservable frame of reference and we don\u2019t, typically, posit\nunobservables without good reason. At the moment, we lack good reason,\nunless we think that the motivations for presentism (e.g., those\ndescribed in\n \u00a72)\n serve to persuade us that a neo-Lorentzian interpretation of the\nphysics of space-time is preferable to the space-time interpretation.\nUndermining thus looks to be a difficult road to plough.\n\nThe second option that Hawley (2006) describes,\n\u201cCounterargument\u201d, is as follows:\n\n\nThis alternative to Undermining accepts that the scientific\nmetaphysics is genuinely confirmed by the role it plays in generating\nempirical success, but claims that independent reasons to believe the\ntraditional metaphysics outweigh this scientific support. (2006:\n464)\n\n\nCounterargument is bold in the extreme. It seems to require that we\nsimply overturn the best physics on the basis of metaphysical\narguments. Perhaps we could take this line (but it seems a very\nchallenging route. The arguments for presentism (those stated in\n \u00a72,\n for instance) look somewhat underpowered when it comes to delivering\nthat result. The way in which counterarguers have typically tried to\nproceed, then, is by giving independent motivations for rejecting the\nspecial theory of relativity (both Crisp 2008 and Monton 2006 may be\nread as doing this).\u00a0An\u00a0interesting way to pursue this\nproject is to argue that STR is to be rejected on scientific grounds,\nrather than for some purely philosophical reason, suggesting that\nanother scientific theory (Quantum Mechanics, perhaps) requires\nabsolute simultaneity. This is the approach taken by\u00a0Tooley\n(1997: 335\u201371), though in defence of the growing block theory\nrather than presentism. Nonetheless, the orthodoxy remains strongly\nopposed to this kind of approach.\n",
