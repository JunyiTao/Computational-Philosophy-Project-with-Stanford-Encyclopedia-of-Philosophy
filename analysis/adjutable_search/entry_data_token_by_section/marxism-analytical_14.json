However, preliminary reflection on the issue of\nsocialist transition\u2014of how to get from \u201chere\u201d to\n\u201cthere\u201d\u2014might still be useful. The many examples of\nsuch reflection from within analytical Marxism include: Cohen\u2019s\ndiscussion of the proletariat as a collective agent (2000a:\n101\u2013115); Adam Przeworski\u2019s account of the electoral\ndilemmas of social democracy (1985); and Erik Olin Wright\u2019s\nreflections on socialist strategy. An outline of the latter is\nprovided here.\n\nWright\u2019s ambition\u2014looking both \u201cbehind\u201d and\n\u201cahead\u201d\u2014is to move beyond the tired and limited\ncontrast between \u201creform\u201d and \u201crevolution\u201d. He\noffers a conceptual map of socialist\u2014and, more broadly,\nanti-capitalist\u2014strategies that have been historically\nimportant, as well as suggesting how they might be combined in a\nstrategic vision for those seeking to escape the harms of contemporary\ncapitalism (2010: 273\u2013365).\n\nWright (2019: 38\u201353) identifies five \u201cstrategic\nlogics\u201d embodied in anti-capitalist struggles (historical\nexamples of movements adopting them are in parentheses). The initial\npair of examples share a revolutionary goal\u2014replacing capitalism\nwith a very different kind of economic structure\u2014but have\ncompeting accounts of how that might be\naccomplished. First, smashing capitalism: according to which\n\u201ca decisive, ruptural break\u201d with a system that is, at\nroot, unreformable is necessary (see early twentieth-century\nrevolutionary communism). Second,\ndismantling capitalism: according to which democratic\npolitics facilitate state-directed reforms gradually replacing\ncapitalist elements with alternatives (see \u201cdemocratic\nsocialism\u201d). Third, taming capitalism: which typically\nuses state policies of regulation and redistribution in order to\n\u201cneutralise\u201d the harms of capitalism, without trying to\ndestroy their underlying causes (see post-war social democracy). Those\nlast two strategies rely heavily on the exercise of state power, and\nin this respect differ from Wright\u2019s final two models. Fourth,\nresisting capitalism: which involves more or less organised\nattempts within civil society\u2014and not primarily the\nstate\u2014to alleviate the harms of capitalism (see trade unions,\nboycotts, consumer movements, and anarchist-inflected social\nmovements). And fifth, escaping capitalism: which pursues a\nmore separatist strategy, not tackling capitalism directly, but rather\nseeking to isolate a group from its harms (see intentional\ncommunities, communes, and certain religious communities).\n\nWright locates these five \u201cstrategic logics\u201d within a\nschematic typology with two dimensions (2019: 53\u201358). The first\ndimension differentiates between \u201cneutralising harms\u201d and\n\u201ctranscending structures\u201d. The \u201ctaming\u201d and\n\u201cresistance\u201d models aim to neutralise harms; and the\n\u201csmashing\u201d, \u201cdismantling\u201d, and\n\u201cescaping\u201d, models aim to transcend structures. The second\ndimension differentiates between three \u201ctransformative\nlogics\u201d using the metaphor of a \u201cgame\u201d. The\n\u201cruptural\u201d strategy seeks to change the game being played,\nand is exemplified by the \u201csmashing\u201d model. The\n\u201csymbiotic\u201d strategy seeks to change the rules of the game\nbeing played, and is exemplified by the \u201ctaming\u201d and\n\u201cdismantling\u201d models. And the \u201cinterstitial\u201d\nstrategy seeks to change the way in which one plays within a given set\nof rules, and is exemplified by the \u201cresisting\u201d and\n\u201cescaping\u201d models. Anyone seeking to visualise a grid with\nthese two dimensions will realise that one of the six resulting cells\nis empty. No-one presumably uses a sledgehammer to crack a nut, or, a\nlittle less figuratively, no-one thinking that the most effective way\nof neutralising harms is to change the game itself.\n\nWright\u2019s evaluation of these historical movements is broadly\nnegative; they all seem to have either failed at the time, or to have\nonly limited current purchase. From the political vantagepoint of\ndeveloped capitalist countries: revolutionary communism and democratic\nsocialism have largely disappeared; social democracy has declined, and\nlost its connection with labour militancy; and, whilst\n\u201canarchist inflected social movements\u201d survive as perhaps\nthe most dynamic form of anti-capitalism, they often remain\ndisconnected from political projects and parties. Wright appears most\ncritical of the ruptural strategy, doubting that democratic support\nfor a sharp break and rapid transition is sustainable given the nature\nof the \u201ctransition trough\u201d\u2014a concept adopted from\nPrzeworski\u2014faced by the middle classes, in particular (2010:\n308\u2013320). (A \u201ctransition trough\u201d refers to the\ninitial decline in production and living standards that is\nlikely to follow a ruptural break with capitalism. Depending on the\ndepth and extent of these troughs, it might not be in the material\ninterests of individuals to support a ruptural path to socialism even\nwhere they plausibly believe that the material conditions of life\nunder socialism will eventually come to exceed those of\npreviously-existing capitalism.)\n\nLooking forwards, Wright recommends the strategy of eroding\ncapitalism (2019: 59\u201364). Existing economic systems are said to\ncombine capitalism with other economic arrangements, including what we\nmight call proto-socialist alternatives (embodying democracy,\nequality, and community). The eroding strategy combines elements of\ninterstitial and symbiotic approaches. In the former mode, it involves\na \u201cbottom-up\u201d strategy focused on civil society,\nparticipating in various marginal alternative economic activities. In\nthe latter mode, it involves a \u201ctop-down\u201d strategy focused\non the state, seeking to secure and expand those alternatives through\nlaw and public policy. The ambition of this mixed approach is\ngradually to allow proto-socialist economic relations and practices to\nsucceed and displace their capitalist counterparts.\n\nThe strategic vision of eroding capitalism corresponds only\nuncertainly to real world movements, but Wright suggests that certain\nmovements in Latin America and Southern Europe (including Podemos in\nSpain) may capture something of its spirit. He also portrays it as\nanalogous to the process by which capitalism itself historically\ndisplaced feudalism. Proto-capitalist forms of economic life emerged\nin the niches of feudalism, and slowly grew to the point where they\ndisplaced the dominant feudal structures. Political upheavals occurred\nas part of this process, but they typically served to consolidate and\nrationalise socioeconomic changes that had already taken place (Wright\n2019: 61).\n",
