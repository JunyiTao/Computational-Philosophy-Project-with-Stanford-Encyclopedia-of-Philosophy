Some philosophers have taken the\nkind of certainty characteristic of mathematical knowledge to be the\ngoal at which philosophy should aim. In the Republic,\nPlato says that geometry \u201cdraws the soul towards truth and produces\nphilosophic thought by directing upwards what we now wrongly direct\ndownwards\u201d (527b). Descartes also thought that a philosophical method\nthat proceeds in a mathematical way, enumerating and ordering\neverything exactly, \u201ccontains everything that gives certainty to the\nrules of mathematics\u201d (Discourse on the Method, PW 1, p.\n121). Other philosophers have adopted different models for how to best\nunderstand certainty. For example, Aristotle and Aquinas take\nscientific explanation to be essential to certainty (see Pasnau 2017,\npp. 5\u20137), while Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b thought that certainty\narose out of religious practice (see Albertini 2005). For many\nempiricists, certainty with respect to empirical matters is to be\nfound in basic beliefs that are grounded in some fundamental aspect of\nperceptual experience (see, e.g., Lewis 1952).\n\nLike knowledge, certainty is an epistemic property of beliefs. (In a\nderivative way, certainty is also an epistemic property of subjects:\nS is certain that p just in case S\u2019s\nbelief that p is certain.) Although some philosophers have\nthought that there is no difference between knowledge and certainty,\nit has become increasingly common to distinguish them. On this\nconception, then, certainty is either the highest form of knowledge or\nis the only epistemic property superior to knowledge. One of the\nprimary motivations for allowing kinds of knowledge less than\ncertainty is the widespread sense that skeptical arguments are\nsuccessful in showing that we rarely or never have beliefs that are\ncertain (see Unger 1975 for this kind of skeptical argument) but do\nnot succeed in showing that our beliefs are altogether without\nepistemic worth (see, for example, Lehrer 1974, Williams 1999, and\nFeldman 2003; see Fumerton 1995 for an argument that skepticism\nundermines every epistemic status a belief might have; and see Klein\n1981 for the argument that knowledge requires certainty, which we are\ncapable of having).\n\nAs with knowledge, it is difficult to provide an uncontentious\nanalysis of certainty. There are several reasons for this. One is that\nthere are different kinds of certainty, which are easy to conflate.\nAnother is that the full value of certainty is surprisingly hard to\ncapture. A third reason is that there are two dimensions to certainty:\na belief can be individually certain at a particular moment, or it can\nbe certain over some greater length of time in a system of\nbeliefs.\n", "toc": [{"#KinCer": "1.

Kinds of certainty\n\nThere are various kinds of certainty (Russell 1948, p. 396). A belief\nis psychologically certain when the subject who has it is\nsupremely convinced of its truth. Certainty in this sense is similar\nto incorrigibility, which is the property a belief has of\nbeing such that the subject is incapable of giving it up. But\npsychological certainty is not the same thing as incorrigibility. A\nbelief can be certain in this sense without being incorrigible; this\nmay happen, for example, when the subject receives a very compelling\nbit of counterevidence to the (previously) certain belief and gives it\nup for that reason. Moreover, a belief can be incorrigible without\nbeing psychologically certain. For example, a mother may be incapable\nof giving up the belief that her son did not commit a gruesome murder,\nand yet, compatible with that inextinguishable belief, she may be\ntortured by doubt.\n\nA second kind of certainty is epistemic. Roughly\ncharacterized, a belief is certain in this sense when it has the\nhighest possible epistemic status. Epistemic certainty is often\naccompanied by psychological certainty, but it need not be. It is\npossible that a subject may have a belief that enjoys the highest\npossible epistemic status and yet be unaware that it does. (More\ngenerally, a subject\u2019s being certain that p does not\nentail that she is certain that she is certain that p; on\nthis point, see Van Cleve 1979, and see Alston 1980 on level\nconfusions in epistemology.) In such a case, the subject may feel less\nthan the full confidence that her epistemic position warrants. I will\nsay more below about the analysis of epistemic certainty and its\nrelation to psychological certainty.\n\nSome philosophers also make use of the notion of moral\ncertainty (see Markie 1986; James 2020). For example, in the Latin\nversion of Part IV of the Principles of Philosophy, Descartes\nsays that \u201csome things are considered as morally certain, that\nis, as having sufficient certainty for application to ordinary life,\neven though they may be uncertain in relation to the absolute power of\nGod\u201d (PW 1, pp. 289\u201390). Thus characterized, moral\ncertainty appears to be epistemic in nature, though it is a lesser\nstatus than epistemic certainty (see Matthen 2014 for a\nsimilar account of what he calls \u201cempirical certainty\u201d). In the\nFrench version of this passage, however, Descartes says that\n\u201cmoral certainty is certainty which is sufficient to regulate\nour behaviour, or which measures up to the certainty we have on\nmatters relating to the conduct of life which we never normally doubt,\nthough we know that it is possible, absolutely speaking, that they may\nbe false\u201d (PW 1, p. 289 n. 2). Understood in this way, it does\nnot appear to be a species of knowledge, given that a belief can be\nmorally certain and yet false (contra Markie 1986, p. 36). Rather, on\nthis view, for a belief to be morally certain is for it to be\nsubjectively rational to a high degree. In a similar way, Spinoza\ndistinguishes moral certainty from mathematical certainty and says\nthat the former should not be rejected when \u201cit is confirmed by the\ntestimonies of so many prophets, is a source of great solace for those\nwhose capacity to reason is limited, is of great value to the state,\nand may be believed unreservedly without danger or damage\u201d\n(Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, ch. 15; see James 2020, ch.\n1). Moral certainty understood in this way is not merely a form of\npsychological certainty, as someone who has the highest degree of\nconfidence in a particular claim might nevertheless do so for\nmanifestly irrational or frivolous reasons.\n\nAlthough all three kinds of certainty are philosophically interesting,\nit is epistemic certainty that has traditionally been of central\nimportance. In what follows, then, I shall focus mainly on this kind\nof certainty.\n2. Conceptions of certainty\n\nThere have been many different conceptions of certainty. Each of them\ncaptures some central part of our intuitive understanding of\ncertainty, but, as we shall see, none of them is free from\nproblems.\n2.1 Indubitability\n\nCertainty is often explicated in terms of indubitability.\nThis has been done in a variety of ways (see, e.g., Goodman 1952;\nUnger 1978, p. 328). One prominent account of certainty is suggested\nby Descartes\u2019s presentation of his famous Archimedean point, the\ncogito (I am thinking, therefore I exist). In the Second\nMeditation, Descartes reviews the extensive doubts of the First\nMeditation before saying that even if \u201cthere is a deceiver of\nsupreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving\nme,\u201d still \u201che will never bring it about that I am nothing\nso long as I am something\u201d (PW 2, p. 17). Descartes then\nconcludes that the proposition that he himself exists is true whenever\nhe considers it. It is often thought that the cogito has a\nunique epistemic status in virtue of its ability to resist even the\n\u201chyperbolic\u201d doubts raised in the First Meditation (see\nMarkie 1992 and Broughton 2002). However, even if Descartes took this\nview of the certainty of the cogito, he did not accept the\ngeneral claim that certainty is grounded in indubitability. In the\nThird Meditation, Descartes says that he is certain that he is a\nthinking thing, and he explains the certainty of this \u201cfirst\nitem of knowledge\u201d (it is unclear whether he regards it as\ndistinct from the cogito) as resulting from the fact that it\nis a clear and distinct perception (PW 2, p. 24). (Matters are\ncomplicated, however, by the fact that Descartes also says in the\nThird Meditation that certainty depends on knowing that God exists and\nis not a deceiver.)\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein also seems to connect certainty with\nindubitability. He says that \u201cIf you tried to doubt everything\nyou would not get as far as doubting anything. The game of doubting\nitself presupposes certainty\u201d (1969, \u00a7115). What makes\npossible doubting is \u201cthe fact that some propositions are exempt\nfrom doubt, are as it were like hinges on which those turn\u201d\n(1969, \u00a7341). Although Wittgenstein\u2019s view is sometimes\ntaken to be\u2014or to provide the basis for\u2014an epistemically\nsatisfying response to skepticism (see, e.g., Wright 2003 and 2004),\nit is hard to see the kind of certainty he has characterized as being\nepistemic, rather than merely psychological or moral, in nature (on\nthis point, see Pritchard 2005; Coliva 2010 and 2012). Thus, when\nWittgenstein says, \u201cThe difficulty is to realize the\ngroundlessness of our believing\u201d (1969, \u00a7166) it seems\nclear that the so-called hinge propositions are ones that we are\npsychologically incapable of calling into question. This is, of\ncourse, compatible with their being false.\n\nIn general, every indubitability account of certainty will face a\ndilemma: when the subject finds herself incapable of doubting one of\nher beliefs, either she has good reasons for being incapable of\ndoubting it, or she does not. If she does not have good reasons for\nbeing unable to doubt the belief, the type of certainty in question\ncan be only psychological, not epistemic, in nature. On the other\nhand, if the subject does have good reasons for being unable to doubt\nthe belief, the belief may be epistemically certain. But, in this\ncase, what grounds the certainty of the belief will be the\nsubject\u2019s reasons for holding it, and not the fact that the\nbelief is indubitable.\n\nA second problem for indubitability accounts of certainty is that, in\none sense, even beliefs that are epistemically certain can be\nreasonably doubted. I shall say more about this in \u00a73 below.\n2.2 Infallibility\n\nAccording to a second conception, a subject\u2019s belief is certain\njust in case it could not have been mistaken\u2014i.e.,\nfalse (see, e.g., Lewis 1929). Alternatively, the subject\u2019s\nbelief is certain when it is guaranteed to be true. This is\nwhat Roderick Firth calls the \u201ctruth-evaluating\u201d sense of\ncertainty (1967, pp. 7\u20138). As with knowing that p,\nbeing certain that p entails that it is true that p.\nCertainty is, however, significantly stronger than lesser forms of\nknowledge (contra Mizrahi 2019, who conflates knowledge with certainty\non the grounds that knowledge is factive). In cases where the subject\nknows without being certain that p, it is actually true that\np, though it could have been false. In that case, of course,\nthe subject would no longer know that p. But, where the\nsubject is certain that p, it does not merely turn out to be\ntrue that p\u2014in some sense it could not have been\notherwise.\n\nThe difficulty for this conception of certainty is specifying the\nprecise sense in which the belief could not have been false. What is\nmeant cannot be what is called metaphysical or broadly logical\nimpossibility. Although some of the paradigmatically certain beliefs\nare necessarily true in this sense, many others are not. For example,\nthough I am certain of the truth of the cogito, it is not\nnecessarily true (in the metaphysical sense) that I exist. That is, it\nis possible that I might not have existed. We might attempt to solve\nthis difficulty by saying that the belief is guaranteed to be true by\nthe subject\u2019s grounds for it (see, e.g., Audi 1998, pp.\n218\u20139). But this opens up two further problems for this\nconception of certainty. First, if the truth of the belief is\nguaranteed by the subject\u2019s grounds for holding it, then it\nlooks as though the certainty of the belief ought to be attributed to\nthose grounds as well. That is to say, the belief would be certain,\nnot in virtue of the fact that it is guaranteed to be true, but rather\nin virtue of its relation to the grounds that make that guarantee\npossible. This would be so because the grounds would provide a deeper\nexplanation for the certainty of the belief than would the fact that\nthe belief is guaranteed to be true. Moreover, some further account of\nthe certainty of the grounds will still need to be provided.\n\nThe second problem is very similar to one that arises for philosophers\nattempting to provide an account of fallibilistic knowledge (i.e.,\nknowledge that is less than certain). According to the standard\naccount, the subject has fallibilistic knowledge that p when\nshe knows that p on the basis of some justification\nj, and yet the subject\u2019s belief could have been false\nwhile still held on the basis of j (see, e.g., BonJour 1985,\np. 26; Lehrer 1990, p. 45). Alternatively, the subject knows that\np on the basis of some justification j, but\nj does not entail the truth that p (see, e.g., Cohen\n1988, p. 91; Fogelin 1994, pp. 88\u20139; Jeshion 2000, pp.\n334\u20135; Brown 2018, pp. 15\u201321). The problem with the\nstandard account, in either version, is that it does not allow for\nfallibilistic knowledge of necessary truths. If it is necessarily true\nthat p, then the subject\u2019s belief that p could\nnot have been false, regardless of what her justification for it may\nbe like. And, if it is necessarily true that p, then\neverything\u2014including the subject\u2019s justification for her\nbelief\u2014will entail or guarantee that p. Our attempt to\naccount for certainty encounters the opposite problem: it does not\nallow for a subject to have a belief regarding a necessary truth that\ndoes not count as certain. If the belief is necessarily true,\nit cannot be false\u2014even when the subject has come to hold the\nbelief for a very bad reason (say, as the result of guessing or\nwishful thinking). And, given that the beliefs are necessarily true,\neven these bad grounds for holding the belief will entail or guarantee\nthat it is true.\n\nOne way to solve the problem for the analysis of fallibilistic\nknowledge is to focus, not on the entailment relation, but rather on\nthe probabilistic relation holding between the subject\u2019s\njustification and the proposition believed (see Reed 2002 and 2013).\nWhen the subject knows that p on the basis of justification\nj, and P(p/j) is less than 1, the\nsubject\u2019s knowledge is fallibilistic. (Although epistemologists\nwill disagree about what the appropriate conception of probability is,\nhere is a crude example of how probability may figure in a\nfallibilistic epistemology. A basic historical reliabilist will say\nthat a belief is justified just in case it has been produced by a\nprocess that has yielded a preponderance of true beliefs. So, if the\nprocess has yielded a true belief, say, 90% of the time, the\nprobability that the next belief will be true is 90%; this is so even\nif the belief in question is necessarily true and has been logically\ndeduced from a set of beliefs, each of which is necessarily true.)\nAdapting this solution to the problem for certainty, we can say that\nthe subject is certain that p when\nP(p/j) = 1, where j is the\njustification or grounds for the belief (see Van Cleve 1977 and Lewis\n1952). However, in order for j to impart a probability of 1\nto p, it must also be the case that P(j) =\n1. That is to say, j must be certain for the subject before\nit can make anything else certain. But, if we are to explain the\ncertainty that p by appeal to the certainty that j,\nwe fall into a vicious regress. The only way to stop it is to allow\nthat some beliefs may have an intrinsic probability of 1 (see Russell\n1948, p. 396, and Van Cleve 1977). It is, however, difficult to see\nhow intrinsic probability of this sort is possible (barring, of\ncourse, a subjectivist account of probability, which could, in any\ncase, capture only psychological certainty).\n\nTimothy Williamson (2000, pp. 213\u20137) rejects the connection\nbetween a belief having probability 1 and its being absolutely\ncertain. (On his view, one\u2019s evidence is identical with what one\nknows, so what one knows will be evidence for itself. In a trivial\nsense, then, everything one knows will have probability 1.) He argues\nthat the connection can be broken by denying that beliefs that have\nprobability 1 at a particular time will always thereafter remain at\nthat probability. Further evidence may be acquired that destroys the\nknowledge in question; when that happens, it is no longer evidence,\nlet alone evidence for itself. Williamson finds this result congenial\nbecause, he says, \u201cit is hard to see\nhow any empirical proposition could have the\nintertemporal and intersubjective certainty which the\nconditionalization account demands of evidence\u201d (p. 215). In breaking\nthe connection between certainty and probability 1, then, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that Williamson has done so only for\nabsolute certainty (or certainty over time), but not for certainty at\na time. See\n section 3 below\n for more on the distinction between these two dimensions of\ncertainty.\n2.3 Inimitability\n\nAccording to a third conception of certainty, a subject\u2019s belief\nthat p is certain when it is\ninimitable--i.e., justified in the highest degree (see,\ne.g., Stanley 2008). This is what Firth calls the\n\u201cwarrant-evaluating\u201d sense of certainty (1967, pp.\n8\u201312). Thus, Bertrand Russell says that \u201cA proposition is\ncertain when it has the highest degree of credibility, either\nintrinsically or as a result of argument\u201d (1948, p. 396). There\nare various ways to understand what it means for a belief to be\ncredible or justified in the highest degree. It could mean simply that\nthe belief in question is justified as highly as any belief the\nsubject happens to hold. But, in cases where the subject does not have\nany beliefs that are highly justified, this will imply that even a\nbelief with relatively low justification is epistemically certain.\nPerhaps we could say instead that a belief is justified to the highest\ndegree when it is justified as highly as any belief that\nanyone happens to hold. But this, too, leaves open the\npossibility that a belief with relatively low justification is\nepistemically certain: if all the subjects in existence are in a\ncondition of universal ignorance, all of their beliefs\u2014including\nthe best of them\u2014will have only a low level of justification.\nPerhaps, then, we should say that a belief is justified in the highest\ndegree when it has the highest level of justification\npossible. But even this account is unsatisfactory. Suppose\nthat global skepticism is necessarily true: it is a necessary truth\nthat no subject is capable of having much justification for any of her\nbeliefs; although it may seem to us as though a significant degree of\njustification is possible, this in fact is incorrect. It would then be\nintuitively correct to say that every belief falls far short of\ncertainty, though this would not be permitted by the account of\ncertainty under consideration. We may of course doubt that skepticism\nof this strong variety is correct; nevertheless, it should not be\nsimply ruled out as a matter of definition.\n\nRoderick Chisholm offers a variation on the above approach. According\nto his first definition of certainty (where h, S,\nand t are variables for propositions, subjects, and times,\nrespectively):\n\nh is certain for S at t =df (i)\nAccepting h is more reasonable for S at t\nthan withholding h (i.e., not accepting h and not\naccepting not-h) and (ii) there is no i such that\naccepting i is more reasonable for S at t\nthan accepting h. (1976, p. 27)\n\n\nClause (i) ensures that the subject has some measure of positive\njustification for h\u2014if she had no justification for it,\nit would be more reasonable for her to withhold with respect to\nh. Clause (ii) then says that those beliefs of the subject\nare certain which are at the highest levels of justification for her.\nHowever, this still leaves open the following possibility: h\nis the most highly justified belief the subject has, but it is still\nnot very highly justified (e.g., it may not even be sufficiently\njustified to count as knowledge).\n\nPerhaps for this reason, Chisholm later offered a different definition\nof certainty:\n\np is certain for S =df For every\nq, believing p is more justified for S than\nwithholding q, and believing p is at least as\njustified for S as is believing q. (1989, p. 12)\n\n\nThis definition still has the equivalent of clause (ii) above, and\ntherefore requires the belief that is certain for the subject be the\none that is most highly justified for her. But the second definition\nappears to be more successful in requiring that p be\njustified to a significant degree. Now, believing that p must\nnot only be more justified for the subject than withholding\np, it must also be more justified than withholding with\nrespect to any other proposition. There are many propositions that we\nare capable of entertaining\u2014e.g., the proposition that the\nnumber of people alive at this precise moment is even\u2014where\nthere is not the slightest reason for thinking them to be either true\nor false (though, of course, they must be one or the other). In fact,\ngiven the perfect lack of evidence with respect to propositions of\nthis sort, Chisholm\u2019s definition may set the standard for\ncertainty too high, for it is hard to see how there could be\nany proposition one is more justified in believing than one\nis in withholding belief regarding, say, the parity of the number of\npeople alive at this very moment.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that Chisholm\u2019s definition works\nonly by implicitly relying on what is a contingent feature of our\nepistemic situation. It so happens that we find ourselves in a\nposition of total ignorance with respect to some propositions. But\nthat need not have been the case. We could have ended up in a world\nwhere there is a moderate amount of evidence either for or against\nevery proposition. If one of a subject\u2019s beliefs then happened\nto have slightly more justification than any of the others, it would\nmeet Chisholm\u2019s definition of certainty, though it might still\nhave what we would intuitively take to be a less than ideal level of\njustification.\n\nThere is one further problem with both of Chisholm\u2019s\ndefinitions. Because they both relativize certainty to a particular\nsubject, they make possible the following situation. Two subjects each\nbelieve that p, and in each case the belief is justified to\ndegree n. For the first subject, the belief counts as certain\nbecause none of her other beliefs have a higher level of\njustification. But, for the second subject, the belief in question is\nnot certain because she does have another belief that is slightly more\njustified. If certainty really is grounded in epistemic justification,\nthough, this should not be possible. If a given justification makes a\nbelief certain for one subject, it should do so for everyone.\n\nThere is another approach that Chisholm might take. According to\nparticularism, his favored method in epistemology, we should\nuse particular instances of knowledge and justification as our guide\nin formulating an epistemology (Chisholm 1973 and 1989, pp.\n6\u20137). (By contrast, methodism begins with criteria for\nknowledge and justification and then attempts to ascertain whether, on\nthese criteria, we actually have any knowledge or justified beliefs.)\nAdapting this approach to our present concern, the suggestion is that\nwe formulate an account of certainty in light of paradigmatic\ninstances of beliefs held with certainty. Thus, after giving the\nsecond definition above, Chisholm says that the concept of certainty\nis illustrated by propositions about what he calls\n\u201cself-presenting\u201d mental states and by some logical and\nmetaphysical axioms (1989, p. 12).\n\nAlthough this particularist approach probably is the way in which most\nphilosophers think of certainty, it faces several difficulties. One is\nthat the epistemology of the a priori is far from clear.\nGiven that we do not, apparently, causally interact with necessary\ntruths, it is hard to see how our minds can have access to them. A\nsecond difficulty has to do with knowledge of our own mental\nstates\u2014sometimes referred to as knowledge by\nacquaintance. According to the \u201cspeckled hen\u201d\nproblem, there are aspects of our mental states, such as the rich\ndetail of one\u2019s present visual experience, that we are not\ncapable of knowing\u2014e.g., if one is looking at a speckled hen,\nthere will be a determinate number of speckles in one\u2019s visual\nexperience, which one will not be able to know just in virtue of\nhaving the experience (Ayer 1940, Chisholm 1989, Fumerton 2005). But\nthose aspects we cannot know merely by being conscious of them are\npart of our conscious experience in just the same way as those aspects\nwe are supposed to be able to know; the difficulty is\nspecifying a principled difference between the two. Much more could be\nsaid about the first two problems, but they lie beyond the scope of\nthis article. A third difficulty is that, at least prima\nfacie, knowledge of one\u2019s mental states seems to be of a\nfairly different kind from knowledge of necessary truths. It is not\nclear, at the outset, that we are warranted in taking them to be\nparadigmatic instances of a genuine epistemological kind.\n2.4 Indefeasibility\n\nAccording to a fourth conception of certainty, defended by Peter\nKlein, a belief \u201cis absolutely certain just in case it is\nsubjectively and objectively immune to doubt\u201d\n(1992, p. 63; see also Miller 1978). He explicates this in the\nfollowing way:\n\np is absolutely certain for S if and only if (1)\np is warranted for S and (2) S is warranted\nin denying every proposition, g, such that if g is\nadded to S\u2019s beliefs, the warrant for p is\nreduced (even if only very slightly) and (3) there is no true\nproposition, d, such that if d is added to\nS\u2019s true beliefs the warrant for p is reduced\n(even if only very slightly). (1992, p. 63)\n\n\nKlein says that the second condition is what makes the belief\nsubjectively immune to doubt, presumably because it is the beliefs and\nexperiences that constitute S\u2019s subjective perspective\nthat render her warranted in denying all propositions that would\nreduce the warrant for p. However, S\u2019s belief\nsystem might contain false beliefs that could warrant her in denying\nevery g relevant to p\u2014even, in some cases,\nwhere the g in question is itself true\u2014and so her\nbelief that p might meet condition (2) and yet still be\nfalse. Condition (3) is meant to prevent this situation; if p\nis false, the true belief that ~p can be added to\nS\u2019s belief system, thereby reducing the warrant\nS has for p. In requiring both (2) and (3), then,\nthe account focuses on beliefs where the subject\u2019s subjective\nsituation is in a sense properly aligned with an objective structure\nof reasons (for a similar view, see Pollock 1986).\n\nThere are two major difficulties facing a view of this sort. First, it\nis not clear how one belief is supposed to reduce the warrant for\nanother. Suppose that I correctly believe that I have a headache and\nthat my belief is, in an intuitive sense, absolutely certain. The\nfirst condition of Klein\u2019s account is satisfied: the belief is\nwarranted in virtue of my experiencing the headache. But is the second\ncondition also satisfied? That is, would I be warranted in denying,\nsay, the proposition that I do not in fact have a headache? If this\nwere to be a belief added to my belief system, I would of course have\ncontradictory beliefs. Would that entail that the warrant for both\nbeliefs should be diminished? If the answer is yes, then my belief\nthat I have a headache is not absolutely certain. Moreover, it is hard\nto see how any belief could then be absolutely certain, given\nthat we can always add to our belief systems the contradictory of any\nof our beliefs. If the answer is no, however, there should be some\nexplanation for why the proposition that I do not have a headache can\nbe denied. Presumably, the explanation would have something to do with\nmy experiencing the headache. But then what explains the certainty of\nthe belief is the fact that it is grounded in the experience; the\nbelief\u2019s being subjectively immune to doubt is merely a\nconsequence of its certainty, and not the explanation for it. This\nwould mean that the focus of the view has shifted from subjective\nimmunity to doubt to some sort of special warrant. How there could be\nsuch a special warrant, though, would need an account. To see the\npoint more clearly, notice that subjective immunity to doubt will be\npossible only in cases where the subject\u2019s belief is\n(intuitively) absolutely certain. For any belief b that is\nless than certain, the following belief could be added to the\nsubject\u2019s belief system: the warrant for b could be\nmisleading. That belief would reduce the subject\u2019s warrant for\nb (even if only slightly) were it to be added to her belief\nsystem, but it is not a proposition the subject can deny without being\nabsolutely certain that b is true. The upshot, then, is that\nsubjective immunity to doubt is not well-suited to playing a role in\nan account of certainty. Instead, it looks as though our understanding\nof subjective immunity to doubt depends on a prior grasp of what\ncertainty is.\n\nThe second difficulty has to do with condition (3), which is supposed\nto secure objective immunity to doubt. Although it is undeniable that\na subject for whom condition (3) is satisfied would be in a desirable\nsituation, it does not seem to be attributable to her in the right\nsort of way\u2014and, especially, not in the way that we expect\ncertainty to be attributable to the person who is certain. To see\nthis, suppose that my warrant for the belief that p is only\nmoderately good. Nevertheless, my guardian angel protects my belief by\nmaking sure that any proposition such that, if it were true, would\n(when added to my belief system) reduce my warrant for p, is\nfalse. That is, my guardian angel makes sure that all potential\ndefeaters for my belief are removed. Suppose, for example, that I see\nfrom a great distance what looks like a hawk. My guardian angel\nimmediately annihilates all non-hawk flying objects in the area; the\npotential defeater, that there are flying objects indistinguishable\nfrom a hawk in the vicinity, has thus been rendered false. Although\nthis would make my belief that p objectively immune to doubt,\ninsofar as (3) is satisfied, it does not seem as though it would carry\nmy belief any closer to certainty. The fact that the warrant for my\nbelief is only moderately good renders irrelevant the work my guardian\nangel does in the world outsid of my beliefs. (Nor would the situation\nbe helped if we stipulated that condition (2) is also satisfied. Given\nthat my belief system could contain many false beliefs that might\nwarrant me in rejecting all potential defeaters, my belief might be\nboth subjectively and objectively immune to doubt\u2014and yet still\nhave a relatively low degree of warrant.)\n\nIt may be that one of the four conceptions of certainty discussed\nabove could be improved so as to answer all objections. But, until\nthat happens, it is safe to say that there is at present no completely\nsatisfactory conception of certainty.\n3. Two dimensions of certainty\n\nTypically, epistemologists are concerned with the conditions under\nwhich a subject may know or be certain that p at a particular\nmoment. Interestingly, however, somewhat different issues arise for\ncertainty over time. As this was a primary concern for Descartes, who\ntells us in the First Meditation that he wants to establish something\n\u201cin the sciences that was stable and likely to last,\u201d we\ncan best see how those issues arise in the context of\nDescartes\u2019s epistemology (PW 2, p. 12).\n\nIn the Second Set of Objections, Mersenne poses the following problem:\nalthough Descartes has argued that our ability to know anything\ndepends on our first knowing that God exists and is not a deceiver, it\nseems clear that an atheist mathematician can have the same sort of\nmathematical knowledge as a theist. In response, Descartes allows that\nthe atheist does have a clear awareness (cognitio) of simple\nmathematical truths, but he denies that this clear awareness is\n\u201ctrue knowledge [scientia]\u201d (PW 2, p. 101). At\nfirst glance, it seems that Descartes draws the distinction between\ncognitio and scientia precisely so he can deny\ncertainty to the atheist mathematician. But there is good reason to\nthink that this is not what he has in mind.\n\nTo see this, notice that, if Descartes does not allow the atheist to\nbe able to acquire knowledge through clear and distinct perception, he\nwill fall into the so-called Cartesian Circle. This problem, first\nidentified by Arnauld in the Fourth Set of Objections, arises if\nDescartes holds both of the following claims: (i) I can know that my\nclear and distinct perceptions are true only if I first know that a\nnon-deceiving God exists, and (ii) I can know that a non-deceiving God\nexists only if I first know that my clear and distinct perceptions are\ntrue. Because knowing one thing is a precondition for knowing the\nother, and vice versa, I cannot know either of them. In fact,\nhowever, it does not look as though Descartes does fall into the\ncircle. Although it is pretty clear that he is committed to\n(1)\u2014in the Third Meditation, he says that, \u201cif I do not\nknow [whether there is a non-deceiving God], it seems that I can never\nbe quite certain about anything else\u201d (PW 2, p. 25)\u2014there\nis no reason to take him to be committed to (ii). Descartes is willing\nto permit the meditator to use clear and distinct perceptions before\nknowing that they are generally true. The clearest example, of course,\nis the cogito; the meditator first comes to know that he\nexists as a thinking thing and only later comes to know that his\nknowledge of the cogito is grounded in its clarity and\ndistinctness. The same, then, can be said for the meditator\u2019s\nknowledge\u2014grounded in some clearly and distinctly perceived\ncausal principles\u2014that God exists. In using those principles,\nthe meditator does not first need to have the general knowledge that\nclear and distinct perceptions are true (see Van Cleve 1979).\n\nStill, some philosophers might object that the meditator has no\nbusiness using principles that he does not know to be true. Descartes\nwould not be sympathetic to this objection. As he says in his\nconversation with Burman, so long as the meditator is using the causal\nprinciples, \u201che is actually paying attention to them. And for as\nlong as he does pay attention to them, he is certain that he is not\nbeing deceived, and he is compelled to give his assent to them\u201d\n(PW 3, p. 334; see also PW 2, pp. 25, 48; see also Cottingham 1986, p.\n67). So, the doubt that Descartes raises with respect to clear and\ndistinct perceptions does not extend to the moments at which one is\nactually enjoying them. Rather, it is a doubt that, in\ngeneral, clear and distinct perception may not be a reliable\nsource of beliefs (Kenny 1968, p. 194). When Descartes introduces the\nevil demon hypothesis in the First Meditation, it is meant to\nencapsulate his ignorance of his own origin\u2014and, in particular,\nignorance of the construction of his own mind. Without knowing that a\nnon-deceiving God exists, it is possible for the meditator that his\nmind works in such a way that it falls into error even when it is\ncontemplating the simplest questions. This doubt is chased away when\nhe actually does contemplate such a question, but it can\neasily return at a later time when his thoughts are turned elsewhere.\nThis is the sense in which the atheist mathematician\u2019s\ncognitio, or clear awareness, is imperfect. Although it is\ncertain at the time the atheist has the perception, it can always be\nrendered doubtful at another time. The theist has no\nadvantage over the atheist at the time each enjoys a clear and\ndistinct perception. Rather, the theist\u2019s advantage lies in the\nfact that, armed with the certainty that a non-deceiving God exists,\nshe will always remain free from doubt (Descartes PW 2, p.\n48; see also Kenny 1968, p. 193; Reed 2012). Consequently, she will be\nable to construct her scientific theories without ever falling prey to\nworries about whether her work has value, and\u2014perhaps even more\nimportantly\u2014she will be in a position to definitively put an end\nto theoretical disagreements with others. (The Stoics make a similar\ndistinction; see Cicero On Academic Scepticism, p. 84.)\n\nGiven this account of Descartes\u2019s epistemology, we can now see\nthat both cognitio and scientia are varieties of,\nnot only knowledge, but certainty as well. This is an important point\nto note, for it means that certainty cannot be straightforwardly\ncharacterized in terms of indubitability. For a belief known with\ncertainty to be immune to doubt\u2014not merely at a moment but\nabsolutely\u2014it must be embedded in a coherent system of beliefs,\nall of which are known with certainty (for a similar account of\nDescartes\u2019s epistemology, see Sosa 1997, though Sosa takes\ncognitio to be a lower grade of knowledge than\nscientia; also, see Loeb 1992 on the importance of stability\nfor Descartes\u2019s epistemology). Scientia, or systematic\ncertainty, represents an admirable, but probably unattainable, goal.\nIf humans are capable of certainty at all, it is surely of the sort\nthat is capable of mixing with doubts.\n4. Applications of certainty\n\nEdward Craig (1990) has argued that we can better understand the\nconcept of knowledge by examining the purpose or purposes it serves.\nIn a similar way, perhaps, the concept of certainty can be rendered\nclearer by looking at the ways in which philosophers have tried to put\ncertainty to use. Most fundamentally, certainties provide us with\ninputs to inference that are stable and secure. If they are immune to\ndoubt, they can put an end to the demand for reasons that feature in\nthe Pyrrhonist\u2019s argument for general skepticism (see Sextus\nEmpiricus, Outlines of Scepticism; Sosa 1997; Sienkiewicz\n2019). If they have probability 1, they can simplify reasoning by\nallowing the reasoner to treat them as simply given, without having to\nattend to the risk of error for each individual premise or the\naccumulation of error as uncertain premises are combined. If they are\nindefeasible, they can allow us to reject any potential\ncounterevidence as misleading.\n\nSome philosophers have argued that certainty is the norm of assertion:\none can assert that p just in case one is certain\nthat p (Stanley 2008; Peterson 2019; Beddor 2020b).\nThe norm is often defended by adapting Moore\u2019s paradox to certainty\n(Moore 1942). According to the original form of the paradox, there is\nsomething infelicitous about assertions like, \u201cIt\u2019s raining, but I\ndon\u2019t believe it is.\u201d Defenders of the certainty norm of assertion\nargue that assertions like, \u201cDogs bark, but I\u2019m not certain that they\ndo,\u201d are just as odd (Stanley 2008, p. 47). The explanation\nof this infelicity is then provided by the fact that\ncertainty is the norm of assertion. When the speaker asserts, \u201cDogs\nbark,\u201d but then goes on to deny being certain of that claim, she has\nundermined her own assertion, contradicting in practice what she has\njust said.\n\nWilliamson (2000) and Turri (2016) reject the certainty norm of\nassertion. Although a certainty version of Moore\u2019s paradox does\nsound infelicitous, it doesn\u2019t sound quite so bad as a knowledge\nversion. Moreover, the oddity of the certainty version can be\nexplained by the fact that there is generally \u201ca reluctance to allow\nthe contextually set standards for knowledge and certainty to diverge\u201d\n(Williamson 2000, p. 254). That is, the standards for what counts as\nknowledge and as certainty typically match one another. Nevertheless,\nin some contexts we can pull them apart. When that happens, Williamson\nsuggests that we assess assertions in accordance with the knowledge\nnorm. Turri (2016) reports empirical results confirming that this is\nin fact the way ordinary speakers assess assertions.\n\nSome philosophers have also argued that certainty is the norm of\npractical reasoning: one can rely on p in relevant\npractical reasoning just in case one is certain\nthat p (Beddor 2020a). The argument for the\ncertainty norm depends on two premises. First, if one is genuinely\nrelying on the premise that p, one is psychologically\ncertain that p. If one has a lower credence with respect\nto whether p, one is not in fact relying\non p but instead on the proposition that it is\nlikely that p. Second, the epistemic norm for psychological\ncertainty is epistemic certainty. To be psychologically certain with\nrespect to a proposition for which one does not have epistemic\ncertainty is to violate Hume\u2019s dictum that \u201cA wise man...proportions\nhis belief to the evidence\u201d (Hume 1748 [2007]).\n\nAlthough the second premise of the argument seems reasonable enough,\nthe first premise is overly rigorous. In many cases, the chance of a\npremise being false is negligible, though not quite zero.  We\nmight well rely on it simply because it isn\u2019t worth the effort to\nformulate a more precise premise. For example, in choosing a path to\nwalk home on a day when I am in no particular hurry, I might rely on\nthe thought that the path I\u2019m on is as good as any other--and I don\u2019t\nbother to calculate the possibility that I\u2019m wrong. Even in cases\nwhere I am, in fact, trying to be more careful, I\u2019ll often have to\nrely on an uncertain belief at some point. Suppose I\u2019m trying to\ndecide whether to rely on the proposition\nthat p but come to see that it is uncertain. So, I\npull back to the claim that it is likely that p. But I\nmay not be certain that it\u2019s likely that p. If so, I can\neither pull back even further--to the proposition that it is likely\nthat it is likely that p--or I can simply rely, albeit\ntentatively, on the proposition that p. In almost every\ncase, the latter is the more natural course of action to take.\n\nA common objection to both the claim that certainty is the norm of\nassertion and the claim that certainty is the norm of practical action\nis that certainty is scarce (see Unger 1975). If so, this will mean\nthat we rarely make proper assertions or behave in a practically\nrational way. Defenders of these norms typically respond by offering a\ncontextualist account of certainty (Stanley 2008, p. 54; Beddor 2020a,\np. 722). On such a view, the epistemic standards governing\nattributions of certainty can vary from one context to another.\n(Variations in conversational context will yield a contextualist view\nof the sort DeRose 1995 defends for knowledge attributions;\nvariations in practical context will yield a subjective-sensitive or\ninterest-relative view like those Hawthorne 2004 and Stanley 2005\ndefend with respect to knowledge.) So, what is certain in one context\nmay fail to be in another, if the relevant standards have risen in the\nlatter context. Although some contexts will have relatively stringent\nstandards for what counts as certain, others may have standards that\nare relatively lax. In the latter contexts, then, attaining certainty\nshouldn\u2019t be overly challenging.\n\nThe debate regarding contextualism is too enormous to enter into here.\nStill, it is worth asking whether certainty that is protected by the\ncontextualist strategy really should count as genuine certainty. After\nall, the idea was that a belief one knew with certainty to be correct\nwas one that made one immune from doubt full stop, and\nnot just immune from doubt in the present circumstances. It was\nsupposed to be a belief that one could rely on without hesitation in\ndrawing inferences, evaluating new evidence, and answering questions\nand challenges from others. Contextually protected certainty is\ncapable of nothing quite so stable and secure. In fact, it looks more\nlike the epistemic version of moral certainty--good enough for most\npurposes, but not as good as it might be (see Matthen 2014\nand Locke 2015 for views that more explicitly eschew the label of\n\u201cepistemic certainty\u201d in fleshing out this kind of epistemic\nstatus).\n\nPhilosophers who defend fallibilism about knowledge will be untroubled\nby this outcome (see Hetherington 2001; Reed 2013; Brown 2018). Others\nmay lament the fading of certainty as an epistemic ideal while arguing\nthat its abandonment is nevertheless better than going down to\nepistemic defeat (Pasnau 2017). A hardy few may continue to press\nahead, like Descartes, in the attempt to \u201cscale the heights of human\nknowledge\u201d (PW 1, p. 11; Klein 1981).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Albertini, Tamara, 2005. \u201cCrisis and Certainty of Knowledge in\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (1058\u20131111) and Descartes\n(1596\u20131650),\u201d <em>Philosophy East and West</em>, 55:\n1\u201314.", "Alston, William, 1980. \u201cLevel Confusions in\nEpistemology,\u201d <em>Midwest Studies in Philosophy</em>, 5:\n135\u201350.", "Audi, Robert, 1998. <em>Epistemology</em>, London: Routledge.", "Ayer, A.J., 1940. <em>The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge</em>,\nNew York: Macmillan.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1956. <em>The Problem of Knowledge</em>,\nLondon: Penguin.", "Beddor, Bob, 2020a. \u201cCertainty in Action,\u201d\n<em>Philosophical Quarterly</em>, 70: 711\u201337.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2020b. \u201cNew Work for\nCertainty,\u201d <em>Philosopher\u2019s Imprint</em>, 20:\n1\u201325.", "BonJour, Laurence, 1985. <em>The Structure of Empirical\nKnowledge</em>, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.", "Broughton, Janet, 2002. <em>Descartes\u2019s Method of\nDoubt</em>, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.", "Brown, Jessica, 2018. <em>Fallibilism: Evidence and\nKnowledge</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Chisholm, Roderick, 1966. <em>Theory of Knowledge</em>, Englewood\nCliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1973. <em>The Problem of the\nCriterion</em>, Milwaukee, WI: Marquette University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1976. <em>Person and Object</em>, La Salle,\nIL: Open Court.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1989. <em>Theory of Knowledge</em>,\n3<sup>rd</sup> edition, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.", "Cicero, <em>On Academic Scepticism</em>, C.
