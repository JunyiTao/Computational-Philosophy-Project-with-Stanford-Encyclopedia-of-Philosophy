    "main_text": "Unity Reconsidered\n13. Unity Reconsidered\n\nIn \u0397.6, Aristotle returns to the problem of the unity of\ndefinition\n (discussed above in Section 9)\n and offers a new solution based on the concepts of potentiality and\nactuality. He begins by pointing out (recalling the language of\n\u0396.17) that the things whose unity he is trying to explain are\nthose \u201cthat have several parts and where the totality of them is\nnot like a heap, but the whole is something beyond the parts\u201d\n(1045a8\u201310). His task is to explain the unity of such\ncomplexes.\n\nThe problem is insoluble, he says, unless one realizes that\n\u201cthere is on the one hand matter and on the other shape (or\nform, morph\u00ea), and the one is potentially and the other\nactively.\u201d Once one realizes this, \u201cthen what we are\ninquiring into will no longer seem to be a puzzle\u201d\n(1045a20\u201325). He offers the following example\n(1045a26\u201335). Suppose round bronze were the\ndefinition of \u2018cloak\u2019. If someone were to ask \u201cwhat\nmakes a cloak one thing, a unity?\u201d the answer would be obvious.\nFor bronze is the matter, and roundness is the form. The bronze is\npotentially round, and round is what the bronze actually is when it\nhas received this form. The cause of the unity of the cloak (in this\nsense of \u2018cloak\u2019) is just the cause of bronze being made\nround. Since the cloak is something that was produced, or brought into\nbeing, there is no cause of its unity other than the agent who put the\nform into the matter. Bronze (the matter) is a potential sphere, and\nthe cloak is an actual sphere. But round bronze is equally\nthe essence of both the actual sphere and the potential one. The\nbronze and the roundness are not two separate things. The bronze is\npotentially a sphere, and when it is made round it constitutes an\nactual one\u2014a single sphere of bronze.\n\nIt is easy to see how this hylomorphic analysis explains the unity of\na substantial material particular, since neither the matter nor the\nform of such a particular is by itself a single material individual,\nand it is only when they are taken together that they constitute such\nan individual. But the question Aristotle is trying to answer is this:\n\u201cwhy on earth is something one when the account of it is what we\ncall a defnition?\u201d (\u0396.12, 1037b11). Since proper\ndefinables are universals, it remains to be seen how the proposed\nsolution applies to them. After all, universals are not material\nobjects, and so it is not clear how they can be viewed as hylomorphic\ncompounds. But Aristotle has at his disposal a concept that can fill\nthis bill perfectly, viz., the concept of intelligible matter\n(hul\u00ea no\u00eat\u00ea). (The main purpose of\nintelligible matter is to provide something quasi-material for pure\ngeometrical objects that are not realized in bronze or stone, for\nexample, to be made of.) So we surmise that it is for this reason that\nAristotle goes on (1045a33) to introduce matter into the\ncurrent context. If this is so, we may conclude that the material\ncomponent in the definition of a species is intelligible matter.\nElsewhere, he explicitly describes genus as matter: \u201cthe genus\nis the matter of what it is said to be the genus of\u201d (\u0399.8,\n1058a23). So a species too, although it is not itself a material\nobject, can be considered a hylomorphic compound. Its matter is its\ngenus, which is only potentially the species defined; its differentia\nis the form that actualizes the matter. The genus does not actually\nexist independently of its species any more than bronze exists apart\nfrom all form. The genus animal, for example, is just that\nwhich is potentially some specific kind of animal or other. Aristotle\nconcludes (1045b17\u201321) that \u201cthe ultimate\nmatter and the form (morph\u00ea) are one and the same, the\none potentially, the other actively \u2026 and what potentially is\nand what actively is are in a way one.\u201d\n\nThis solution, of course, applies only to hylomorphic compounds. But\nthat is all it needs to do, according to Aristotle. For he ends the\nchapter by claiming that the problem of unity does not arise for other\nkinds of compounds that are not material: \u201cThings that have no\nmatter \u2026 are all unconditionally just what is a one\u201d\n(1045b23).\n",
