He used this account in order to argue against\nCollins\u2019s view of the viciousness of the experimenter\u2019s\nregress. Yet other accounts of calibration explaining the process of\nmeasurement evoke similar worries.\n\nE. Tal defines calibration as \u201cthe activity of establishing a\ncorrelation between indications of a measuring instrument and quantity\nvalues associated with a measurement standard\u201d (Tal 2017a, 243).\nMere \u201cinstrument indications\u201d (Tal 2017a) become\n\u201cmeasurement outcomes\u201d when interpreted in a larger\ncontext of theoretical background and calibration of the measuring\ninstrument. Yet Boyd (2021, 43) worries that this leaves the\nmeasurement open to the vicious regress akin to the\nexperimenter\u2019s regress H. Collins has argued for (see Section\n2.2.1), since the experimenters  do not \u201chave access to\ntrue values of the measurand [i.e., whatever is measured] to use as\nstandards of calibration\u201d.\n\nThe regress may be blocked by comparisons across measuring outcomes\nperformed in differently modeled measurements, i.e. across different\nmeasurement contexts (the context being constituted by intricacies of\nthe operational and theoretical background of apparata). (Tal 2017a,\n239) These different contexts are idealized and then compared in order\nto establish whether they cohere to the predictions concerning the\nmeasurand. Thus, calibration is \u201cthe activity of modeling\ndifferent processes and testing the consequences of such models for\nmutual compatibility\u201d (Tal 2017a, 246). An act of calibration is\neffectively the comparison of idealized models across measuring\nprocesses, where an act of measurement becomes justified by the\nmodels\u2019 mutual coherence.\n\nBoyd (2021, 46) states that idealizations of measurement processes\ncannot provide the foundation for objective measurement since\nidealizations strip the context of its key details. In fact, the\nmeasurement has an epistemic utility by virtue of the\ncontext-sensitive details. The measurement outcomes gain epistemic\nvalue only as \u201cenriched evidence\u201d, i.e., in the wider\nempirical and theoretical context.\n\nMoreover, Tal\u2019s view conflates prediction and calibration (Boyd\n2021, 48) taking us back to the viciousness of the\nexperimenter\u2019s regress. Thus, \u201cCalibration was supposed to\ndisrupt the regress because an instrument could be judged to be\nworking correctly in virtue of something other than success at its\nprincipal aim\u201d (Boyd 2021, 48). Calibration has to provide a\npoint outside the web of cohering predictions if it is to break the\nregress, e.g. by the subtle processing of instrument indications.\n\nProgressive coherentism\u2019s attempted way out of the vicious\nregress, as proposed by Hasok Chang (2004, 2007), points to a\nhistorical trajectory of the development of measuring procedures and\ncalibration. The web of cohering measuring process is dynamic: it\nunfolds in time as a spiral. And the measurement process that\ninitially aims at prediction eventually becomes a result used for\ncalibrating processes. Yet, such spiraling progress may be just an\nelaborate dynamic coherence web of Collins\u2019 type where\ninter-subjective agreement is the foundation, if other non-empirical\nvirtues such as \u201ccreative achievement\u201d play as important\nrole as the empirical ones as claimed by Chang (2007). If so,\ncalibration does not offer an independent leverage to the measurement\noutcomes after all.\n\nPerovi\u0107 (2017) analyzes in-situ calibration procedures in the\nLarge Hadron Collider pointing out that calibration serves as an\nepistemic leverage of Franklin\u2019s type during the commissioning\nphase of the experimental apparatus. But various calibration\nprocedures continue all along and gradually feed into the measurement\nitself during the entire measurement process. Boyd (2021) further\nexplores commissioning procedures and the gradual transition from\n\u201cengineering data\u201c to \u201cscience data\u201d, where\ncriteria of prediction significantly change. The apparatus initially\nrelies on the existing well-known data but then coherence with other\napparata that Tal insists on becomes increasingly less significant in\njustifying the measurement outcomes.\n",
