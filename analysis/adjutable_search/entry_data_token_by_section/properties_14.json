This criterion can hardly work,\nhowever, since there are seemingly distinct properties with the same\nextension, such as having a heart and having\nkidneys, and even wildly different properties such as\nspherical and weighing 2 kilos could by accident be\nco-extensive.\n\nOne could then try the following intensional identity\nconditions: two properties are identical iff they are\nco-intensional, i.e., necessarily co-extensional, where the\nnecessity in question is logical necessity. This guarantees that\nspherical and weighing 2 kilos are different even if\nthey happen to be co-extensional. Following this line, one may take\nproperties to be intensions, understood as, roughly,\nfunctions that assign extensions (sets of objects) to predicates at\nlogically possible worlds. Thus, for instance, the predicates\n\u201chas a heart\u201d and \u201chas kidneys\u201d stand for\ndifferent intensions, for even if they have the same extension in the\nactual world they have different extensions at worlds where there are\ncreatures with heart and no kidneys or vice versa. This approach is\nfollowed by Montague (1974) in his pioneering work in natural language\nsemantics, and in a similar way by Lewis (1986b), who reduces\nproperties to sets of possible objects in his modal realism,\nexplicitly committed to possible worlds and mere possibilia\ninhabiting them. Most philosophers find this commitment unappealing.\nMoreover, one may wonder how properties can do their causal work if\nthey are conceived of in this way (for further criticisms see Bealer\n1982: 13\u201319, and 1998: \u00a74; Egan 2004). However, the\ncriterion of co-intensionality may be accepted without also buying the\nreduction of properties to sets of possibilia (Bealer views\nthis as the identity condition for his conception 1 properties; see\nbelow). Still, co-intensionality must face two challenges coming from\nopposite fronts.\n\nOn the one hand, from the perspective of empirical science,\nco-intensionality may appear too strong as a criterion of identity.\nFor the identity statements of scientific reductions, such as that of\ntemperature to mean kinetic energy, could suggest that some properties\nare identical even if not co-intensional. For example, one may accept\nthat having absolute temperature of 300K is having mean\nmolecular kinetic energy of \\(6.21 \\times 10^{-21}\\) (Achinstein\n1974: 259; Putnam (1970: \u00a71)\u00a0and Causey (1972)\u00a0speak of\n\u201csynthetic identity\u201d and \u201ccontingent\nidentity\u201d, respectively). Rather than logical necessity, it is\nnomological necessity, necessity on the basis of the causal\nlaws of nature, that becomes central in this line of thought.\nFollowing it, some have focused on the causal and\nnomological roles of properties, i.e., roughly, the causes\nand effects of their being instantiated, and their involvement in laws\nof nature, respectively. They have thus advanced causal or\nnomic criteria. According to them, two properties are identical\niff they have the same causal (Achinstein 1974: \u00a7XI; Shoemaker\n1980) or nomological role (Swoyer 1982; Kistler 2002). This line has\nbeen influential, as it connects to the \u201cpure\ndispositionalism\u201d discussed in\n \u00a75.2.\n There is however a suspicion of circularity here, since causal and\nnomological roles may be viewed as higher-order properties (see entry\non\n dispositions, \u00a73).\n\nOn the other hand, once matters of meaning and mental content are\ntaken into account, co-intensionality might seem too weak, for it\nmakes a property \\(P\\) identical to any logically equivalent property,\ne.g., assuming classical logic, \\(P\\) and (\\(Q\\) or not\n\\(Q\\)). And with a sufficiently broad notion of logical\nnecessity, even, for example, being triangular and being\ntrilateral are identical. However, one could insist that\n\u201ctrilateral\u201d and \u201ctriangular\u201d appear to have\ndifferent meanings, which somehow involve the different geometrical\nproperties having a side, and having an angle,\nrespectively. And if being triangular were really identical\nto being trilateral, from the fact that John believes that a\ncertain object has the former property, one should be able to infer\nthat John also believes that such an object has the latter property.\nYet, John\u2019s ignorance may make this conclusion unwarranted. In\nthe light of this, borrowing a term from Cresswell (1975), one may\nmove from intensional to hyperintensional identity\nconditions, according to which two properties, such as trilaterality\nand triangularity, may be different even if they are co-intensional.\nIn order to implement this idea, Bealer (1982) take two properties to\nbe identical iff they have the same analysis, i.e., roughly, they\nresult from the same ultimate primitive properties and the same\nlogical operations applied to them (see also Menzel 1986; 1993). Zalta\n(1983; 1988) has developed an alternative available to those who admit\ntwo modes of predication (see\n \u00a71.4):\n two properties are identical iff they are (necessarily) encoded by\nthe same objects.\n\nHyperintensional conditions make of course for finer distinctions\namong entities than the other criteria we considered. Accordingly, the\nformer are often called \u201cfine-grained\u201d and the latter\n\u201ccoarse-grained\u201d, and the same denominations are\ncorrespondingly reserved for the entities that obey the conditions in\nquestion. Coarse- or fine-grainedness is a relative matter. The\nextensional criterion is more coarse-grained than the intensional or\ncausal/nomological ones. And hyperintensional conditions themselves\nmay be more or less fine-grained: properties could be individuated\nalmost as finely as the predicates expressing them, to the point that,\ne.g., even being \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) and being \\(Q\\) and\n\\(P\\) are kept distinct, but one may also envisage less stringent\nconditions that make for the identification of properties of that sort\n(Bealer 1982: 54). It is conceivable, however, that one could be\nlogically obtuse to the point of believing that something has a\ncertain property without believing that it has a trivially equivalent\nproperty. Thus, to properly account for mental content,\nmaximal hyperintensionality appears to be required, and it is\nin fact preferred by Bealer. Even so, the paradox of analysis\nraises a serious issue.\nOne could say, for example, that being a circle is being\na locus of points equidistant from a point, since the latter\nprovides the analysis of the former. In reply, Bealer distinguishes\nbetween \u201cbeing a circle\u201d as designating a simple\n\u201cundefined\u201d property, which is an analysandum\ndistinct from the analysans, being a locus of points\nequidistant from a point, and \u201cbeing a circle\u201d as\ndesignating a complex \u201cdefined\u201d property, which is indeed\nidentical to that analysans. Orilia (1999: \u00a75.5)\nsimilarly distinguishes between the simple analysans and the\ncomplex analysandum, without admitting that expressions for\nproperties such as \u201cbeing a circle\u201d could be ambiguous in\nthe way Bealer suggests. Orilia rather argues that the\n\u201cis\u201d of analysis does not express identity but a weaker\nrelation, which is asymmetrical in that analysans and\nanalysandum play different roles in it. The matter keeps\nbeing discussed. Rosen (2015) appeals to grounding to characterize the\ndifferent role played by the analysans. Dorr (2016) provides\na formal account of the \u201cis\u201d used in identity statements\ninvolving properties, according to which it stands for a symmetric\n\u201cidentification\u201d relation.\n",
