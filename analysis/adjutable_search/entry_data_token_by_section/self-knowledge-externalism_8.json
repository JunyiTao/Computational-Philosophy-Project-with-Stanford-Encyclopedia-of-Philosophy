    "main_text": "Slow Switching Arguments || Reply 1: Self-Verifying Judgments\n3.1 Reply 1: Self-Verifying Judgments\n\nAs concerns the (A) to (B) maneuver, Burge protests that this glosses\nover an especially secure type of armchair self-knowledge. The claim\nis that some judgments about one\u2019s own thought contents (a.k.a.,\n\u201csecond order\u201d judgments) are self-verifying.\nRoughly, these are judgments where \u201cthinking makes it\nso\u201d\u2014where judging \u201cI am now thinking that p\n\u201d is enough to make it true that one is now thinking\nthat p. Importantly, however, this self-verifying feature is\nlimited to one\u2019s occurrent thinking of p (in\ncontrast to any standing or dispositional thoughts).\n\nTo illustrate the self-verifying feature, consider the judgment:\n\n\n\n(W)\nI am thinking, with this very thought, that water is wet.\n\n\n\n\nBurge\u2019s idea is that in executing this judgment, one \u201cruns\nthrough\u201d the very thought that the judgment is about. That is,\njudging (W) necessitates thinking the thought that water is\nwet\u2014and thinking this thought is precisely what (W) contends. So\nthe very act of judging (W) suffices to render the judgment true. It\nis in that sense that the judgment is self-fulfilling or\nself-verifying. Besides Burge, self-verifying judgments were touted\naround the same time by Davidson (1987; 1988) and Heil (1988; 1992),\nthough others have subsequently embraced them as well (e.g., Falvey\nand Owens 1994, Gibbons 1996, Bar-On 2004, Parent 2007, 2017, chs. 3\nand 7).\n\nNevertheless, the suggestion that certain judgments are\ninfallible can seem exceedingly strong. But for one,\ninfallibility does not imply that the judgment is\nindubitable. A judgment could de facto be perfectly reliable,\nyet the subject might still have some unanswered questions about it.\nSecond, it is crucial that \u2018thinking\u2019 is construed\nminimally, in that to \u201cthink\u201d that p is not\nnecessarily to believe that p. \u201cThinking\u201d\nthat p just means having some mental state or other with the\ncontent p \u2014it does not imply any particular\nattitude toward that content.\n\nIn light of things like Freudian repression, it can be easy to dismiss\nBurge\u2019s view. But it is important that it pertains only to a\nlimited class of rather atypical judgments. For instance, it applies\nonly when the second-order judgment contains a\n\u201cself-referential\u201d mechanism, expressed in (W) by the\nphrase \u2018with this very\n thought\u2019.[21]\n Moreover, the infallibility concerns occurrent judgments that\nattribute the co-occurrent first-order thought. And the\njudgment that (W) can be true even if the subject\u2019s mind also\nharbors, consciously or unconsciously, a variety of other\nthoughts.\n\nAlthough self-verifying judgments are atypical, Burge still thinks\nthey are sufficient to block the inference from (A) to (B). For\napparently, they provide a kind of Cartesian access to one\u2019s own\nthought-contents\u2014meaning that (B) is false even if (A) is true.\nGranted, self-verifying judgments are a rarefied kind of judgment, so\nthe view is not satisfying as a general view of self-knowledge\n(Boghossian 1989, pp. 19\u201322). Still, the main goal was to block\nthe inference from (A) to (B), and self-verifying judgments seem to do\nthat.\n\nQuite a detailed literature has ensued concerning self-verifying\njudgments; the interested reader is directed to the supplemental\ndocuments,\n The Epistemic Status of Self-Verifying Judgments,\n and\n A Problem with Critical Reasoning.\n",
