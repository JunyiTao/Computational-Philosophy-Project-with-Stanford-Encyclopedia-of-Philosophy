    "main_text": "Short biography\n1. Short biography\n\nErnst Bloch was born on the eighth of July 1885 in Ludwigshafen am\nRhein, to a family of a railway employee, almost fully alien to\nacademic life. But this did not upset his early interest in\nphilosophy, supported and reinforced by his experiences in the library\nand the theater of the neighboring city of Mannheim, as well as by his\ncorrespondence with important thinkers of the time (Ernst Mach,\nTheodor Lipps, Eduard von Hartmann and Wilhelm Windelband). Between\n1905 and 1908 Bloch studied philosophy (but also physics and musical\ntheory as minors) in Munich and W\u00fcrzburg, eventually defending\nhis doctoral dissertation, later published under the title\nCritical Reflections on Heinrich Rickert and the Problem of the\nModern Theory of Knowledge (Bloch 1909). He then moved to Berlin,\nwhere he participated in the private colloquium around Georg Simmel\nbetween 1908 and 1911, and to Heidelberg (between 1912 and 1914),\nwhere the circle around Max Weber was Bloch\u2019s main attraction.\nIn these years, a close friendship with Georg Luk\u00e1cs played a\nprominent role in Bloch\u2019s intellectual\ndevelopment\u2014something Luk\u00e1cs also acknowledged for\nhimself while recollecting the encounter with Bloch.\n\nDuring the World War I, Bloch lived in Swiss exile: he firmly opposed\nthe war from the beginning, thus radically differing from most German\nintellectuals at that time. In Switzerland, he was working on his\nfirst major book, The Spirit of Utopia (1918 [2000]). Its\ngeneral spiritualist sentiment was very much due to his first wife,\nElse Bloch-von Stritzki, a devoted Christian. This book contained, as\na relatively autonomous part, Bloch\u2019s most extensive work on the\nphilosophy of music. Another project was a book on formal logic (Bloch\n1985c: 253), which remained a manuscript and was lost in the 1930s\n(Zudeick 1985). Parallel to this work, Bloch was active as a\npolitically engaged public intellectual (Bloch 1923 [1964]; 1985a),\ncriticizing both the militarist Germany and the authoritarian\nbolshevist Soviet Russia (Franz 1985). In 1919, he went back to\nBerlin, where he lived most of the years till 1933, with long stays in\nMunich, Paris, and in different places in Italy and France. In these\nyears Bloch, being both a Jew and an unorthodox thinker, had no\nprospects for an academic career in Germany and mostly worked as a\nfree essayist (Bloch 2007). The major writings from that period\ninclude an historically and philosophically informed biography\nThomas M\u00fcntzer as Theologian of Revolution (1921 [GA\n2]); the new, 1923 edition of The Spirit of Utopia (of which\nthe ultimate version appeared in 1964, see Bloch 1918 [2000], [GA 3]);\nTraces (1930 [2006], [GA 1]), the collection of essays,\nanecdotes and short stories, mostly dating back to the 1910s; and the\nbook on politics and ideology Heritage of Our Times (1935\n[1991], [GA 4]). In the 1930s, Bloch was also working on a long\nsystematic manuscript on the theory and history of materialism\n(Theory-Praxis of Matter), parts of which were eventually\npublished in 1972 as The Problem of Materialism, Its History and\nSubstance (GA 7) and in 2000 as The Logos of Matter\n(Bloch 2000a).\n\nIn 1933, Bloch had to flee to Switzerland, and began roaming around\nEurope (Vienna, Paris, Prague), not least because his wife, Karola,\nwas active as a secret agent of German and Austrian communist party.\nAt that time, he became a resolute Marxist (Bloch 1972b) and even paid\ntribute to the Stalinist hysteria by supporting the show trials of\n1937\u20131938. Still, in 1938 he emigrated not to the Soviet Union,\nas did Luk\u00e1cs, but to the United States. There, he lived (in\nNew York; Marlborough, New Hampshire; and, in 1942\u20131949, in\nCambridge, Massachusetts) concentrated on writing and isolated both\nfrom the American intellectual scene (he hardly spoke English) and\nfrom his fellow emigr\u00e9s (his relations with Adorno\u2019s and\nHorkheimer\u2019s Institute of Social Research were strained). In\n1949, Bloch moved with his family to the newly formed German\nDemocratic Republic to teach philosophy at the University of Leipzig\n(Bloch 1985b). His magnum opus written mostly in the US,\nThe Principle of Hope, was published there and in West\nGermany in 1954\u201359 (GA 5).\n\nThough enthusiastic in the beginning, having received some academic\nrecognition, Bloch came increasingly under pressure and, from 1957 on,\nwhen he was made emeritus, was facing a total isolation, while his\nphilosophy was declared reactionary. The loyalty to Communist power he\nhad been demonstrating, sometimes in quite conformist ways, since the\n1930s, did not change much in the fact that his thinking was clearly\nat odds with the official Marxist doctrine (Caysa et al. 1992). In\n1961, while being on holiday and having learned about the building of\nthe Berlin Wall, Bloch decided to stay in West Germany and to make, as\nhe formulated himself a bit later, the leap from the realm of\nnecessity into the realm of freedom (interview with J. R\u00fchle\n1964, in Traub & Wieser 1975: 21). Bloch then became, not without\ndifficulties, a guest professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen.\nThere, he was teaching and working on the edition of his complete\nworks (published in 1959\u20131978). In these years, his work became\nwidely known, he received numerous awards and honorary degrees, was\nactive as a public speaker (Bloch 1980) and became an icon of the\nGerman Left. In 1961, Natural Law and Human Dignity was\npublished (GA 6), completed in the beginning of the 1940s (see Bloch\n1985c: 528), followed by other key systematic and historical texts,\nsuch as T\u00fcbingen Introduction to Philosophy (1963/64, GA\n13), Atheism in Christianity (1968, GA 14), and\nExperimentum Mundi (1975, GA 15). Bloch remained politically\nactive throughout this last period of his life. He died on the fourth\nof August 1977 in T\u00fcbingen.\n",
