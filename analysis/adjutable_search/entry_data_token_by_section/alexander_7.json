    "main_text": "Late Writings || Art and Other Forms of Value\n4.2 Art and Other Forms of Value\n\nAlexander\u2019s writing on art falls into two kinds. First, there\nare essays on literature and art. These are all reprinted in\nAlexander\u2019s (1939), and cover a wide range of\ntopics: from the art of Jane Austen, to the writings of Pascal,\nto the origin of the creative impulse. Second, there are the pieces\ncomprising Alexander\u2019s account of value. Alexander\u2019s early\ninterest in ethics\u2014exemplified in his first monograph\n(1889)\u2014survived in his later work as a preoccupation with the\nnature of value, albeit with a focus on the aesthetic value of beauty.\nAlexander\u2019s (1920) contained several chapters on the nature of\nvalue, and he goes on to supplement these with further papers on the\nsame theme. These include \u201cNaturalism and Value\u201d, and\n\u201cValue\u201d, both reprinted in Alexander\u2019s\nPhilosophical and Literary Pieces (1939); and \u201cMorality\nas An Art\u201d (1928). These papers culminate in another monograph,\nBeauty and Other Forms of Value\n(1933), Alexander\u2019s most important work on the topic. His\nwritings on value are of greater philosophic interest than those on\nliterature and art.\n\nThe views that Alexander expresses in \u201cMorality as An Art\u201d\nprovide a useful introduction to his full account. In this paper,\nAlexander argues we can fruitfully understand morality by comparing it\nwith fine art. He argues that, just as the value of beauty found in\nart is a human construction, so are moral values:\n\n\nFor it is the most obvious feature of fine art that it is a human\nconstruction. But it is not so evident that truth and morality are as\nmuch constructions of ours as beauty is\u2026 I am here to plead the\nopposite doctrine. The highest so-called values, truth, beauty, and\ngoodness, are all of them human inventions, and the valuable is what\nsatisfies certain human instincts or impulses. (Alexander 1928:\n143)\n\n\nAn objection to this view is that beauty is not constructed; we might\nfind it in a natural landscape, for example. Alexander replies to this\nthat landscapes and other natural phenomena are rendered beautiful by\nthe parts that we pick out, akin to a photographer composing a\npicture. As such, the beauty of nature is composed by us (Alexander\n1928:149). This entails that there is no difference in kind between\nnatural beauty and art; for more on this, see Alexander\u2019s\n\u201cArt and the Material\u201d (reprinted in Alexander 1939).\n\nAlexander argues we construct values in response to certain needs. For\nexample, beauty satisfies the impulse of constructiveness in humans.\nIn \u201cValue\u201d, Alexander connects human art to the dam\nbuilding of beavers (Alexander 1939: 296). Analogously, morality\nsatisfies the impulse of gregariousness or sociality in humans.\n\n\n[I]t is humanized out of the purely animal sociality\u2026 which we\nfind in animals that live in herds like wild dogs, or form societies\nlike bees. (Alexander 1928: 150)\n\n\nBeauty and other forms of Value (1933) expands on this\naccount. Alexander perceives his naturalistic account of value to be\nsimilar to that offered by Spinoza. In \u201cNaturalism and\nValue\u201d, Alexander tells us that Spinoza\u2019s is the\n\u201ctrue\u201d naturalism: everything is extension, including\nvalue, and yet everything is still divine (Alexander 1939: 279).\n\nBuilding on the many smaller pieces that preceded it, Beauty and\nOther Forms of Value provides a full naturalist account of value.\nAlexander\u2019s approach is to discuss the supreme values in\nturn, beginning with beauty, and moving on to truth and goodnes.\nHe continues down to lesser values. He aims to explain not just\nwhat values are, but also how they came to be.\n\nAlexander argues that anything can have value if it matters to a\nthing. In this sense, food is valuable to an animal, and moisture is\nvaluable to a plant. However, the \u201csupreme\u201d\nvalues\u2014beauty, goodness and truth\u2014can be distinguished\nfrom others because they are the only values that are valuable in\nthemselves, for their own sake:\n\n\nWhen we come to the highest values, the beautiful, the true and the\ngood, these in one respect are like wheat and apples: they are objects\nof a certain constitution\u2014statues and sonatas, landscapes,\ngenerous deeds, chemistry. Their pre-eminence as values is that they\nhave no being apart from their value. That is because they are not\nmerely found, like apples, and their value, like the value of apples\nfor food, then discovered, but are made to have value, come into\nexistence along with their value. (Alexander 1933: 293)\n\n\nThe claim that these values come into existence along with their value\nis of course referring to Alexander\u2019s thesis, also given in\nhis Beauty and other forms of Value (1933), that the\nsupreme values are human inventions.\n\nAs we saw above, Alexander argues that humans construct values in\nresponse to certain needs or instincts. The final part of Beauty\nand Other Forms of Value identifies the animal origin of our\nsupreme values. For example, there is an analogy to be drawn between\nthe social impulse in humans and in bees. \u201cNaturalism and\nValue\u201d explains that in the same way that bees\u2019\ninstinct for finding honey once seemed to be\n\u201cmagical\u201d and yet has been explained by biology in\nnaturalistic terms, similarly values appear to be magical and yet can\nbe explained naturally (Alexander 1939: 282). He goes on to argue that\nDarwin\u2019s theory of evolution plays an important role in the\ndevelopment of value:\n\n\n[T]he doctrine of natural selection may be described as the history of\nhow value makes its entry into the organic world. So far as it is a\nnecessary part of the process by which species are established, it is\nthe principle which constitutes the history of value, for it shows how\nthe mere interests of individual organisms come to be well-founded and\nto be values. (Alexander 1933: 287)\n\n\nThe idea is that, for animals, things that have value are usually\nthose that will further the survival of the species, such as food.\nAnimals whose interests do not help to maintain their existence\nsuccumb under the conditions of their existence, and \u201cleave the\nfield\u201d for others. In this way, natural selection provides a\nhistory of value. More on this can be found in Alexander\u2019s\n\u201cNaturalism and Value\u201d (reprinted in Alexander 1939). This\nintegration of the theory of evolution into Alexander\u2019s\naesthetics should come as no surprise to us, being as it is a theme in\nAlexander\u2019s larger work.\n\nAlexander\u2019s writings on art and value were well received in\ntheir day:\n\n\n[Alexander\u2019s] happy blending of Herbert Spencer\u2019s patient\nempiricism with the bolder systematic sweep of Bradley and the giant\nfigures of German idealism was nowhere more fruitful than in his\ntreatment of aesthetics. (Listowel 1939: 183)\n\n\nThe secondary literature includes Listowel (1939), Fox (1934),\nHooper (1950), and Innis (2017).\n",
