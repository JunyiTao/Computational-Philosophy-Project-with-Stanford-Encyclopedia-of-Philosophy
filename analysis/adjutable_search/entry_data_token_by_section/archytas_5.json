    "main_text": "Life and Works || Pseudepigrapha Ascribed to Archytas\n1.6 Pseudepigrapha Ascribed to Archytas\n\nThe treatises under Archytas\u2019 name collected in Thesleff 1965\nhave been almost universally regarded as not by the historical\nArchytas, except for On Law and Justice, where there has been\nconsiderable controversy. Most are only preserved in fragments,\nalthough there are two brief complete works. The most famous of these\npseudepigrapha is Concerning the Whole System [sc. of\nCategories] or Concerning the Ten Categories (preserved\ncomplete, see Szlezak 1972). This work along with the treatise On\nOpposites (Thesleff 1965, 15.3\u201319.2) and the much later\nTen Universal Assertions (preserved complete, first ascribed\nto Archytas in the 15th century AD; see Szlezak 1972)\nrepresent the attempt to claim Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of\ncategories for Archytas and the Pythagoreans (see also Griffin 2015).\nThis attempt was to some extent successful; both Simplicius and\nIamblichus regarded the Archytan works on categories as genuine\nanticipations of Aristotle (CAG VIII. 2, 9\u201325).\nConcerning the Ten Categories and On Opposites are\nvery frequently cited in the ancient commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories. Pseudo-Archytas identifies ten categories with\nnames that are virtually identical to those used by Aristotle, and his\nlanguage follows Aristotle closely in many places. The division of\nArchytas\u2019 work into two treatises, Concerning the Ten\nCategories and On Opposites, reflects the work of\nAndronicus of Rhodes, who first separated the last six chapters of\nAristotle\u2019s Categories from the rest. Thus, the works\nin Archytas\u2019 name must have been composed after\nAndronicus\u2019 work in the first century BC. Other pseudepigrapha\nin metaphysics and epistemology include On Principles\n(Thesleff 1965, 19.3 \u2013 20.17) and On Intelligence and\nPerception (Thesleff 1965, 36.12\u201339.25), which includes a\nparaphrase of the divided line passage in Plato\u2019s\nRepublic. Mansfeld has recently shown that Fragment 1 of the\nlatter work in Thesleff\u2019s collection belongs to the former work\n(Mansfeld 2019). De Cesaris and Horky (2018) provide commentary on\nOn Intelligence and Perception, but much remains obscure in\nthis difficult work. Mansfeld (2019) shows that On Intelligence\nand Perception is not likely to have been an influence on the\naccount of Pythagorean principles in Aetius Placita 1.3.8 as\nhas been suggested by De Cesaris and Horky (2018). Ulacco (2017)\nestablishes new texts (with commentary) for On Principles,\nOn Intelligence and Perception and On Opposites.\nFurther metaphysical and epistemological works include On\nBeing (Thesleff 1965, 40.1\u201316) and On Wisdom\n(Thesleff 1965, 43.24\u201345.4). The authenticity of this latter\nwork has recently been defended on the grounds that its admitted\nsimilarities to passages in Aristotle are a result of Archytas\u2019\ninfluence on Aristotle rather than an indication that the work was\nforged on the basis of Aristotle (Johnson 2008, 193\u2013194). It is\nindeed true that Aristotle devoted several lost works to Archytas and\nmust have been familiar with his thought. However, the issue of\nauthenticity within the Pythagorean tradition has a different\ncharacter than is the case with other ancient authors. In the case of\nan author such as Plato, where the vast majority of surviving works\nare surely authentic, the onus of proof is on anyone who wants to\nargue that a work is spurious. In the Pythagorean tradition, on the\nother hand, where surely spurious works far outnumber genuine ones,\nthe situation is reversed. The onus of proof rests on anyone who\nregards a Pythagorean work as genuine to show that it does not fit the\npattern of the forged Pythagorean treatises and that its contents can\nbe corroborated by evidence dating before the third century, when the\nPythagorean pseudepigrapha start to be generated. Since On\nWisdom does share with the pseudepigrapha the characteristic of\nusing important Aristotelian distinctions (Huffman 2005,\n598\u2013599), even if it is not as blatant a copy of\nAristotle\u2019s ideas as the works on categories ascribed to\nArchytas, it is much more likely that it was forged on the basis of\nAristotle than that Aristotle is using On Wisdom without\nattribution. In order for the latter situation to be probable there\nwould need to be fourth-century evidence independent of On\nWisdom which ascribed the ideas found in it to Archytas. Horky\n2015 includes On Wisdom among the pseudepigrapha and provides\nanalysis of it. For recent discussions of the nature of the\npseudepigrapha ascribed to Archytas see Bonazzi 2013 and Centrone\n2014. For the nature of the appropriation of Aristotle in\npseudepigrapha ascribed to Archytas and other early Pythagoreans see\nUlacco 2016.\n\nThere are also fragments of two pseudepigrapha on ethics and politics,\nwhich have recent editions with commentary: On the Good and Happy\nMan (Centrone 1990), which shows connections to Arius Didymus, an\nauthor of the first century BC, and On Moral Education\n(Centrone 1990), which has ties to Carneades (2nd c. BC). The status\nof one final treatise is less clear. The fragments of On Law and\nJustice (Thesleff 1965, 33.1\u201336.11) were studied in some\ndetail by Delatte (1922), who showed that the treatise deals with the\npolitical conceptions of the fourth century and who came to the modest\nconclusion that the work might be by Archytas, since there were no\npositive indications of late composition. Thesleff similarly concluded\nthat the treatise \u201cmay be authentic or at least comparatively\nold\u201d (1961, 112), while Minar maintained that \u201cit has an\nexcellent claim to authenticity\u201d (1942, 111). Its authenticity\nwas supported by Johnson (2008, 194\u2013198) but more recently Horky\nand Johnson argue that it was not written by Archytas himself and\npropose the somewhat Byzantine theory that it was written by an author\nwho based it on a speech which they hypothesize that Aristoxenus\nassigned to Archytas in his Life of Archytas (2020:\n459\u2013460). On the other hand, DK did not include the fragments of\nOn Law and Justice among the genuine fragments, and most\nrecent scholars have argued that the treatise is spurious. Aalders\nprovides the most detailed treatment, although a number of his\narguments are inconclusive (1968, 13\u201320). Other opponents of\nauthenticity are Burkert (1972a), Moraux (1984, 670\u2013677),\nCentrone (2000) and most recently Schofield (2014). The connections of\nOn Law and Justice to the genuine Fr. B2 of Archytas speak\nfor its authenticity, but its similarities, sometimes word for word,\nto pseudo-Pythagorean treatises by \u201cDiotogenes\u201d (Thesleff\n76.2\u20133, 71. 21\u20132), \u201cDamippos\u201d (Thesleff 68.26)\nand \u201cMetopos\u201d (Thesleff 119.28) argue for its\nspuriousness. Moreover, the authentic Fr. 3 of Archytas shows that\ncalculation (logismos) was the key concept in his political\nphilosophy. Its total absence from On Law and Justice, whose\nfocus is political philosophy, along with the absence of other key\nterms in Fr. 3 (e.g., pleonexia,  homonoia and\nisot\u0113s) is hard to explain, if On Law and\nJustice is authentic (Huffman 2005, 599\u2013606). For a recent\nargument against the authenticity of On Law and Justice,\nwhich further contrasts it with the authentic Fr. 3, see Schofield\n2014: 82\u20135. Even if the work belongs among the pseudepigrapha\nHorky and Johnson are surely right that the controversy about its\nauthenticity has led scholars to neglect the philosophic content of\nthe treatise (Horky and Johnson 2020: 487) and they provide a\ncommentary that attempts to elucidate this difficult text. They regard\nthe text as closely tied to genuine fragments of Archytas and suggest\nthat it can help us understand those fragments, but the similarities\nare of a very general sort. As Zhmud has recently argued there is very\nlittle that is genuinely Pythagorean in the pseudepigrapha (Zhmud\n2019) and that also appears to be true of On Law and Justice.\n\n\nSome testimonia suggest that there were even more pseudo-Archytan\ntreatises, which have not survived even in fragments (Thesleff 47.8\nff.). Two spurious letters of Archytas survive. One is the letter to\nwhich the pseudo-Platonic Twelfth Letter is responding (D.L.\nVIII 79\u201380), and the other is the purported letter of Archytas\nto Dionysius II, which was sent along with the ship in order to secure\nPlato\u2019s release in 361 (D.L. III 21\u20132). Archytas was a\npopular figure in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance, when works\ncontinued to be written in his name, usually with the spelling\nArchitas or Archita. The Ars geometriae, which is ascribed to\nBoethius, but was in reality composed in the 12th century\n(Folkerts 1970, 105), ascribes discoveries in mathematics to Architas\nwhich are clearly spurious (Burkert 1972a, 406). Several alchemical\nrecipes involving the wax of the left ear of a dog and the heart of a\nwolf are ascribed to Architas in ps.-Albertus Magnus, The Marvels\nof the World (De mirabilibus mundi \u2013\n13th century AD). Numerous selections from a book entitled\nOn Events in Nature (de eventibus in natura, also\ncited as de effectibus in natura and as de eventibus\nfuturorum) by Archita Tharentinus (or Tharentinus, or just\nTharen) are preserved in the medieval texts known as The Light of\nthe Soul (Lumen Animae), which were composed in the\nfourteenth century and circulated widely in Europe in the fifteenth\ncentury as a manual for preachers (Rouse 1971; Thorndike 1934, III\n546\u201360). An apocryphal work, The Circular Theory of the\nThings in the Heaven, by Archytas Maximus [!], which has never\nbeen published in full, is preserved in Codex Ambrosianus D 27 sup.\n(See Catalogus Codicum Astrologorum Graecorum, ed. F. Cumont\net al., Vol. III, p. 11). \n",
