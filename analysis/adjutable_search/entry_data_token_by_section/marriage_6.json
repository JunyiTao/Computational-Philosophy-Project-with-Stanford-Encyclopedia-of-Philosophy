    "main_text": "The Politics of Marriage || Marriage and Legal Contract\n4.1 Marriage and Legal Contract\n\nMarriage is a legal contract, but it has long been recognized to be an\nanomalous one. Until the 1970s in the U.S., marriage law restricted\ndivorce and defined the terms of marriage on the basis of gender.\nMarking a shift towards greater alignment of marriage with contractual\nprinciples of individualization, marriage law no longer imposes\ngender-specific obligations, it allows pre-nuptial property\nagreements, and it permits easier exit through no-fault divorce. But\nmarriage remains (at least in U.S. federal law) an anomalous contract:\n\u201cthere is no written document, each party gives up its right to\nself-protection, the terms of the contract cannot be re-negotiated,\nneither party need understand its terms, it must be between two and\nonly two people, and [until 2015, when the US Supreme Court decision\nin Obergefell v. Hodges established same-sex marriage in the\nUS] these two people must be one man and one woman\u201d (Kymlicka\n1991, 88).\n\nProponents of the contractualization, or privatization, of marriage\nhave argued that marriage should be brought further into line with the\ncontractual paradigm. A default assumption for some liberals, as for\nlibertarians, is that competent adults should be legally permitted to\nchoose the terms of their interaction. In a society characterized by\nfreedom of contract, restrictions on entry to or exit from marriage,\nor the content of its legal obligations, appear to be an illiberal\nanomaly. Full contractualization would imply that there should be no\nlaw of marriage at all\u2014marriage officiation would be left to\nreligions or private organizations, with the state enforcing whatever\nprivate contracts individuals make and otherwise not interfering\n(Vanderheiden 1999, Sunstein and Thaler 2008, Chartier 2016; for a\ncritique of contractualization, see Chambers 2016). The many legal\nimplications of marriage for benefit entitlements, inheritance,\ntaxation, and so on, can also be seen as a form of state interference\nin private choice. By conferring these benefits, as well as merely\nrecognizing marriage as a legal status, the state encourages the\nrelationships thereby formalized (Waldron 1988\u201389,\n 1149\u20131152).[2]\n\nMarriage is the basis for legal discrimination in a number of\ncontexts; such discrimination requires justification, as does the\nresource allocation involved in providing marital benefits (Cave 2004,\nVanderheiden 1999). In the absence of such justification, providing\nbenefits through marriage may treat the unmarried unjustly, as their\nexclusion from such benefits would then be arbitrary (Card 1996).\nThus, there is an onus to provide a rationale justifying such resource\nallocations and legal discrimination on the basis of marriage, as well\nas for restricting marriage in ways that other contracts are not\nrestricted.\n\nBefore exploring some common rationales, it is worth noting that\ncritics of the social contract model of the state and of freedom of\ncontract have used the example of marriage against contractual\nprinciples. First, Marxists have argued that freedom of contract is\ncompatible with exploitation and oppression\u2014and Marxist\nfeminists have taken marriage as a special example, arguing against\ncontractualizing it on these grounds (Pateman 1988, 162\u2013188).\nSuch points, as we will see, suggest the need for rules governing\nproperty division on divorce. Second, communitarians have argued that\ncontractual relations are inferior to those characterized by trust and\naffection\u2014again, using marriage as a special example (Sandel\n1982, 31\u201335, cf. Hegel 1821, \u00a775, \u00a7161A). This\nobjection applies not only to contractualizing marriage, but more\ngenerally, to treating it as a case for application of principles of\njustice: the concern is that a rights-based perspective will undermine\nthe morally superior affection between family members, importing\nconsiderations of individual desert which alienate family members from\ntheir previous unselfish identification with the whole (Sandel 1982,\n31\u201335). However, although marriages are not merely an exchange\nof rights, spousal rights protect spouses\u2019 interests when\naffection fails; given the existence of abuse and economic inequality\nwithin marriage, these rights are especially important for protecting\nindividuals within, and after, marriage (Kleingeld 1998, Shanley 2004,\n3\u201330, Waldron 1988).\n",
