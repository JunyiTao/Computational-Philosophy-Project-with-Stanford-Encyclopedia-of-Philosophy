    "main_text": "Contemporary Compatibilism || Compatibilism about the Freedom to Do Otherwise\n4.1 Compatibilism about the Freedom to Do Otherwise\n\nThe Consequence Argument (section 3.1) makes a strong case for the\nincompatibility of determinism and the freedom to do otherwise.\nAssuming that determinism is true, it states that:\n\nNo one has power over the facts of the past and the laws of\nnature.\nNo one has power over the fact that the facts of the past and the\nlaws of nature entail every fact of the future (i.e., determinism is\ntrue).\nTherefore, no one has power over the facts of the future.\n\n\nCompatibilists who accept that alternative possibilities are necessary\nfor moral responsibility must show what is wrong with this powerful\nargument. They also should offer some account of what John Martin\nFischer (1994) has called regulative control\u2014a form of\ncontrol agents possess when they can bring about X and can refrain\nfrom bringing about X\u2014 that makes clear how it is possible even\nat a determined world. We will first consider three different\ncompatibilist attempts to unseat the Consequence Argument. Then we\nwill consider how some compatibilists, the so-called New\nDispositionalists, explain regulative control, that is, how they might\nexplain the freedom to do otherwise in a way that is compatible with\ncausal determinism.\n4.1.1 Challenging Power Necessity and the Past\n\nSome compatibilists have argued against the first premise of the\nConsequence Argument by attempting to show that a person can\nact in such a way that the past would be different. Consider the\ndifference between a person in the present who has the ability to act\nin such a way that she alters the past, as opposed to a\nperson who has the ability to act in such a way such that, if she\ndid so act, the past would have been different. Notice that the\nformer ability is outlandish; it would require magical powers. But the\nlatter ability is, at least by comparison, uncontroversial. It merely\nindicates that a person who acted a certain way at a certain time\npossessed abilities to act in various sorts of ways. Had she exercised\none of those abilities, and thereby acted differently, then the past\nleading up to her action would have been different. To illustrate how\ncomparatively mild such a claim about an agent\u2019s ability and the\npast might be, think about a logically similar sort of claim that is\nsimply about what would be required for an agent to act differently.\nFor example, consider the claim, If I were dancing on the French\nRiviera right now, I\u2019d be a lot richer than I am. Certainly\nthis claim does not mean that if I go to the French Riviera to dance,\nI will thereby be made richer. It only means that were I to\nhave gone there to tango, I would have to have had a lot more cash\nbeforehand in order to finance my escapades. Some compatibilists\n(e.g., Saunders 1968; Perry 2010; Dorr 2016) have argued that\nincompatibilist defenders of the Consequence Argument rely upon the\noutlandish notion of ability in the first premise of their argument.\nBut, these compatibilists maintain, the first premise is falsified\nwhen interpreted with a milder notion of ability.\n4.1.2 Challenging Power Necessity and the Laws of Nature\n\nOther compatibilists have argued against the first premise of the\nConsequence Argument in a parallel way by attempting to show that a\nperson can act in such a way that a law of nature would not\nobtain. As with the distinction drawn regarding ability and the past,\nconsider the difference between a person who has the ability to act in\nsuch a way that she violates a law of nature, as opposed to a\nperson (at a deterministic world) who has the ability to act in such a\nway that, if she were to so act, some law of nature that does\nobtain would not. Notice that the former ability would require\nmagical powers. According to the compatibilist, the latter, by\ncontrast, would require nothing outlandish. It merely tells us that a\nperson who acted a certain way at a certain time possessed abilities\nto act in various sorts of ways. Had she exercised one of those\nabilities, and thereby acted differently, then the laws of nature that\nwould have entailed what she did in that hypothetical situation would\nbe different from the actual laws of nature that did entail what she\ndid actually do. This latter ability does not assume that agents are\nable to violate laws of nature; it just assumes that whatever the laws\nof nature are (at least at deterministic worlds), they must be such as\nto entail, given the past, what an agent will do. If an agent acts\ndifferently in some possible world than she acts in the actual world,\nthen some other set of laws will be the ones that entail what she does\nin that world. Some compatibilists (most notably Lewis 1981, but see\nalso Graham 2008 and Pendergraft 2011), fixing upon ability\npertaining to the laws of nature, have argued that incompatibilist\ndefenders of the Consequence Argument rely upon the outlandish notion\nof ability in the first premise of their argument. But, these\ncompatibilists maintain, that first premise is falsified when\ninterpreted with an uncontroversial notion of ability.\n4.1.3 Challenging the Inferences Based upon Power Necessity\n\nMichael Slote (1982) attempted to refute the Consequence Argument by\nshowing that its central inference is invalid. The central point\ntowards which Slote works is that notions like unavoidability\n(or power necessity) are sensitive to contexts in a way that\nonly \u201cselectively\u201d permits the sort of inference at work\nin the Consequence Argument. Let us work with the idea of\nunavoidability. According to Slote, when we say that something is\nunavoidable for a person, we have in mind \u201cselective\u201d\ncontexts in which the facts pertaining to the unavoidability have\nnothing to do with that person \u2014 the facts bypass that\nperson\u2019s agency altogether (Slote 1982, p.19). It is\nunavoidable for me, for instance, that Caesar crossed the Rubicon, or\nthat most motor vehicles now run on gasoline. Nothing about my agency\n\u2014 about what I can do \u2014 can alter such facts. This\nsuggests that unavoidability is misapplied when it concerns aspects of\na person\u2019s own agency. But notice that in the Consequence\nArgument unavoidability (or power necessity) trades between a context\nin which the notion is appropriately applied, and one in which,\naccording to Slote, it is not. The first premise cites considerations\nthat have nothing to do with a person\u2019s agency \u2014 facts\nprior to her birth, and the laws of nature. It is claimed that these\nfacts are unavoidable for a person, but from this a conclusion is\ndrawn that the very actions a person performs are unavoidable for her.\nYet this, Slote and other compatibilists (such as Dennett 1984a;\nMcKay & Johnson 1996) have suggested, is to draw incompatibilist\nconclusions illicitly from reasonable claims regarding\nunavoidability.\n4.1.4 Accounting for the Freedom to Do Otherwise\n\nEven if some compatibilist reply proves that the Consequence Argument\nis unsound, this alone would not amount to a positive argument for\ncompatibilism. It would merely mean that one key argument for the\nincompatibility of determinism and regulative control is untenable.\nBut that is consistent with the incompatibility of\ndeterminism and regulative control. Indeed, some argue for this\nincompatibility without relying upon the potentially problematic\nassumptions about power necessity at work in the Consequence Argument\n(Fischer 1994; and Ginet 1990, 2003). Furthermore, even if the\ncompatibilist could discredit all current arguments for the\nincompatibility of determinism and regulative control, it still\nbehooves her to offer a positive argument demonstrating the\ncompatibility of determinism and regulative control. Compatibilists\nwishing to defend regulative control, such Berofsky (1987, 1995,\n2012), Campbell (1997), Nelkin (2011), and Vihvelin (2013), still have\ntheir work cut out for them.\n4.1.5 The New Dispositionalism\n\nRecently several compatibilists have offered a positive account of\nregulative control (e.g., Fara 2008; M. Smith 2003; and Vihvelin 2004,\n2013). Call the view these compatibilists advance, the new\ndispositionalism.\n\nIn advancing a compatibilist thesis, Vihvelin speaks of the ability to\ndo otherwise (and especially choose otherwise) in terms of a bundle of\ndispositions (2004, p. 429). Likewise, Fara proposes a dispositional\nanalysis of the ability to do otherwise. And Smith speaks of the\nrational capacities to believe and desire otherwise (and so,\npresumably, do otherwise) in terms of a \u201craft of\npossibilities\u201d (2003, p.27). For Fara, Vihvelin, and Smith, we\nassess claims about the disposition constitutive of the ability to do\notherwise, or the dispositions in the bundle, or the possibilities in\nthe raft, by attending to the intrinsic properties of an agent in\nvirtue of which she acts when she tries (Fara 2008, p.861), or the\ncausal bases of the pertinent dispositions (Vihvelin 2004, p. 436), or\nthe underlying structure of a rational capacity (Smith, p. 29). How\nso?  Fara does not say, though it seems likely he would agree to\nsomething like the proposals offered by Vihvelin and Smith. According\nto them, we hold fixed the relevant causal base or underlying\nstructure of an agent\u2019s disposition to, say, wave hello to a\nfriend, or tell the truth under interrogation, and we consider various\ncounterfactual conditions in which that causal base or underlying\nstructure operates unimpaired. Does the agent in an appropriately rich\nrange of such counterfactual conditions wave hello or tell the truth?\nIf she does, then even if in the actual world she does not wave hello\nor tell the truth, she was able to do so. She had at the time of\naction the pertinent agential abilities or capacities. And this is\ntrue even if that world is determined (see, e.g., Vihvelin 2004,\n437). Why?  Because there is no basis for contending that when we test\nthe relevant dispositions at other possible worlds, we have to\nrestrict the worlds to ones in which we hold fixed the past and the\nlaws. Note how the problems with the classical compatibilists\u2019\ncounterfactual analysis are circumvented. If we are attending to the\ncausal base of the relevant dispositions, we can easily see how\nDanielle\u2019s relevant causal base is ill-equipped for picking up\nblond haired dogs.\n\nThe new dispositionalism clearly improves upon classical\ncompatibilism. But how does it fare in its own right? Do we have here\na compelling positive account of the ability\u2014and so the\nfreedom\u2014to do otherwise that is compatible with determinism? One\nslippery matter has to do with the way the relevant worlds are\nidentified in the preceding paragraph. We have to restrict our\nattention to possible worlds in which the causal base of, or\nunderlying structure for, the ability operates unimpaired. Some will\nclaim that this restriction is not dialectically innocent. Consider a\nFrankfurt example (section 4.2). Suppose Jones freely shoots Smith,\nbut if he were about to do otherwise, Black would cause Jones to do so\nagainst his (Jones\u2019s) will. When Jones shoots Smith on his own,\nhe does so freely and is morally responsible, despite the fact that,\ndue to Black\u2019s presence, he was not free to do otherwise. Fara\n(2008, pp.854\u20135), Nelkin (2012), Smith (2003, p. 19), and\nVihvelin (2000, 2004, pp.445\u20138, 2013) say otherwise. They say\nJones could have done otherwise, was able to do otherwise, and was\nfree to do otherwise when he shot Smith on his own. Why? Roughly,\nbecause if we fix on the underlying causal structure implicated in\nSmith\u2019s shooting Jones on his own, and if we go only to other\nworlds in which that causal structure operates unimpeded, we will rule\nout worlds in which the counterfactual intervener Black is at play.\nThen we will be able to specify a range of true counterfactuals in\nwhich an agent had some reason, for instance, to do otherwise, and she\ndid otherwise. The delicate question here, one which we will not\nattempt to resolve, is whether in accounting for the freedom to do\notherwise the new dispositionalists are entitled to restrict\nattention only to worlds in which the relevant causal base operates\nunimpeded.\n\nOther compatibilists, most notably, John Martin Fischer (1994), and\nFischer and Mark Ravizza (1998) (see section 5.5 below), have appealed\nto similar restrictions. But in doing so, they only mean to explain\nthe nature of the freedom or control exhibited in how the agent did\nact\u2014that is, what Fischer has termed her guidance\ncontrol. In striking contrast to how the new dispositionalists\nreason, they do not think they are thereby entitled to claim that an\nagent in a Frankfurt example is free to do otherwise. So it is\npossible that what the new dispositionalists have identified with the\npertinent counterfactuals they fix upon is not the freedom to do\notherwise, but instead, a freedom located in what an agent does do\n(which is a matter of guidance control, not regulative control). This,\nat least, is how compatibilists like Fischer and Ravizza would reason.\n[For a lively debate over just this issue, see the exchange between\nFischer (2008) and Vihvelin (2008).]\n",
