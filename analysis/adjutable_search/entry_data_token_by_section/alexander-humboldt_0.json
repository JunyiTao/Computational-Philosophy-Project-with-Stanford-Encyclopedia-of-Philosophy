    "main_text": "Life and Works || Early Life and Education\n1.1 Early Life and Education\n\nAlexander von Humboldt\u2014the son of Alexander Georg Humboldt, a\nPrussian army officer, and the widow Marie-Elisabeth von Holwede\n(n\u00e9e Colomb)\u2014was born in Berlin on 14 September 1769. His\nbrother, Wilhelm, was born two years earlier, and both children were\nraised at the Tegel Castle, in the east of Berlin. The later King\nFriedrich Wilhelm II was Humboldt\u2019s godfather.\n\nAs was common for aristocratic families at the time, the Humboldt\nbrothers received their education from private tutors, including\nJoachim Heinrich Campe and Gottlob Johann Christian Kunth, and had\nlessons with Kant\u2019s former student, Markus Herz. Herz introduced\nthem to physical geography, and to his wife\u2019s salon. The two\nbrothers were regular attendees at Henriette Herz\u2019s salon, and\nAlexander exchanged a significant set of letters with Herz\n(Hey\u2019l 2007). In addition, the brothers were tutored by the\nbotanist, Karl Ludwig Willdenow (1765\u20131812), whose writing on\nBerlin\u2019s flora influenced Humboldt.\n\nFollowing his mother\u2019s wishes, Humboldt (alongside his brother)\nmatriculated at the University of Frankfurt an der Oder in 1787 to\nstudy law, with the goal of becoming a Prussian government servant. In\n1789, the two brothers moved to the University of G\u00f6ttingen,\nwhere Humboldt studied under (among others) Blumenbach. In\nG\u00f6ttingen, he met August Wilhelm Schlegel, Friedrich Heinrich\nJacobi, and Georg Forster, the explorer and radical thinker who had\ntravelled with Captain Cook on his second world trip (1772) and\nauthored (with his father) Reise um die Welt [Voyage\nAround the World] (1777). From March to July 1790, Humboldt\ntravelled with Forster across western Europe, and went on to dedicate\nhis first publication, Beobachtungen \u00fcber einige Basalte am\nRhein [Observations of some Basalt at the Rhine] (1790),\nto Forster. Like Forster, Humboldt sought to detail both the\nenvironmental and the cultural landscapes, and describe their mutual\ninfluence.\n\nIn 1791, Humboldt began training at the Freiberg School of Mines\n(where Friedrich von Hardenberg [i.e., Novalis] also trained), under\nthe geologist Abraham Werner. Following successful completion, he\nassumed a post in the Prussian Department of Mines.\n",
