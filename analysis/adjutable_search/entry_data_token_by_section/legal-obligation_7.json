    "main_text": "Non-Transactional Theories\n5. Non-Transactional Theories\n\nThe appeal of transactional theories is that it seems intuitively\nplausible that political obligation has something to do with the\nduties generated by the important benefits that states provide to\ntheir members. The problem is that the mere provision of benefits\nseems insufficient to generate obligations unless certain\npsychological conditions are fulfilled by those who receive the\nbenefits, and possibly also by those who provide them. But, as we have\nseen, it is doubtful that these conditions will be fulfilled by all\nthose over whom states claim authority.\n\nThis has led some to abandon the idea that political obligation can be\ngrounded in some sort of transaction whereby we offer our allegiance\nto our state in return for the services it provides. Some of the most\ninteresting developments in the contemporary debate consists in\nexploring viable alternatives to this strategy.\n",
