    "main_text": "Consistent and Inconsistent Change\n5. Consistent and Inconsistent Change\n\n\nIf a changing thing has different and incompatible properties then a\ncontradiction is threatened. The obvious move to make when confronted\nwith the fact that things change, is to say with Kant (1781) that\nthey change in relation to time, which avoids the inconsistency. But\nthen another problem emerges. In what sense can one thing persist\nthrough change? Identity across time and space is the mark of\nuniversals, but we also account particulars such as billiard balls\nand persons as having self-identity across time.\n\n Aristotle\u2019s views on the persistence of things are worth noting here.\nAt the risk of gross oversimplification of what is treated thoroughly\nelsewhere (see the entry on \n Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics, it\ncan be said that early on he took the view that what persists over\ntime and through change, the substrate, can be identified\nwith matter, and that it is the form of matter which\nis acquired or lost (Physics I, 5\u20137). When he wrote the\nCategories, it is substance which is said to be\nsusceptible of contrary attributions; and as such substance itself has\nno opposites. (Categories 4a10). In the Metaphysics \\(Z\\), a more\ncomplex doctrine of substance, that which \\(is\\), is worked\nout. Substance is not the substrate, matter, since that lacks\nparticularity. Its substance, what it is to be that\nthing, that without which it does not exist, is its\nessence. Aristotle then links essence with his theory of\ncauses, being identified variously with its final cause and with its\nformal cause. \n\n Although Aristotle\u2019s views about change \u2014 in particular, his\ndistinction between essence and accident \u2014 have sometimes been\nthought to contain a solution to the problem of persistent identity\nthrough change, it seems to this author that they do not really get a\ngrip on the problem in its most fundamental form. This is perhaps\nclearest in the Categories, where the ability of substance to admit\nincompatible accidental features is more-or-less definitional.\n\n The problem can be made sharper by reflection upon the law of the\nindiscernibility of identicals. If a thing-at-\\(t_{1}\\)\nwere identical with a thing-at-\\(t_{2}\\), then they\nshould share all their properties. What sort of identity is it, if\nnot that? But if the properties at different times are incompatible,\nthen a contradiction follows. Because they emphatically took the view\nthat contradictions are never true, the great Buddhist logicians\nDharmakirti (C7th CE) and his commentator Dharmottara (C8\u20139th CE),\nwho had certainly read their Aristotle, deduced that identity over\ntime does not exist (see Scherbatsky (1930) vol 2). This is the\nBuddhist doctrine of moments, essentially an ontology of\ninstantaneous temporal slices. The doctrine of the momentariness of\nexistence is felicitously in accord with the core Buddhist doctrine\nof the impermanence of all things. The doctrine of moments might seem\nto be an unnecessarily strong application of impermanence, certainly\nunnecessary for soteriological purposes, were it not for the evident\nstrength of the argument in its favour, not to mention its accord\nwith the spacetime ontology of modern physics. On the other hand, it\nis of course psychologically very difficult to believe that one\u2019s own\nself, as something genuinely self-identical, has not endured from\nmoment-to-moment in the past. Even so, the thesis of the\nmomentariness of human existence has had a recent defender in Derek\nParfit (1984), who asks what sort of principle could unify the\ntemporal stages sufficiently closely to be worth calling identity. He\nargues that none could, and proposes that internalising the\nmomentariness of our lives has a beneficial effect on how we should\nface our deaths.\n\n This theme is echoed in a recent debate on the topic of\n\u2018temporary intrinsics\u2019, which also connects with the\nearlier-mentioned concept of Cambridge change. Cambridge change in a\nthing is still change in something or other, but it is not\nalways change in the thing itself. Thus we might seek to\nisolate change in the thing itself by change in its\nintrinsic properties. But then we have the problem of in\nwhat sense it continues to be just one thing through a change in its\nintrinsic properties. Now obviously this raises the question of how\nto define the concept of intrinsicality. We do not address that here,\nsince it is discussed elsewhere in this Encyclopedia, see\nWeatherson (2002). So assuming a prima facie distinction\nbetween the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of a thing, how does a\nthing persist through changes in its intrinsic properties? David\nLewis and others debated this question, e.g., Lewis\n(1986), (1988). Several options for a solution were canvassed, three\nof which were as follows.\n\n (1) The basic existents are things indexed by times, that is\ntime-slices. What primarily exist are things-at-a-time:\n\u201c\\(a\\) is red at \\(t\\)\u201d is rendered\n\u201c\\(a\\)-at-\\(t\\) is red\u201d. Things that persist over\ntime are then wholes made up of such parts, and one says that\npersisting things perdure rather than endure. This\nis the solution favoured by Lewis, by the present author, and by\nspace-time theory.\n\n (2) A second option is to say that, instead of indexing things, one\nindexes properties: \u201c\\(a\\) is red at \\(t\\)\u201d is\nrendered as \u201c\\(a\\) is red-at-\\(t\\)\u201d. This option\ndoes not seem to have had any defenders, perhaps because those\nproperties which are universals are supposed to be wholly in each of\ntheir instances, which the indexing apparently denies.\n\n (3) A third option takes as its basic minimal idea that the index\nmodifies the whole event: \\((a\\)\u2019s being red) holds at \\(t\\). A\nvariant is to take the index as modifying the exemplification\n\u2018relation\u2019: \\(a\\) exemplifies-at-\\(t\\) redness. Versions\nof this position were urged by several contributors: Johnston (1987),\nLowe (1987), (1988), Haslanger (1989). However, the problem for\nadverbial-style analyses anywhere is to provide enough semantics,\nenough logical structure for the event, to account for the logical\nimplications of the sentences under analysis, as Davidson (1967)\npointed out. So for example one has things like: \\((((Fa)\\) at \\(t)\n\\amp a=b)\\) implies \\(((Fb)\\) at \\(t)\\); or \\((((Fa)\\) at \\(t_{1})\n\\amp((Ga)\\) at \\(t_{2}) \\amp(F\\) is incompatible with \\(G))\\) implies\nnot \\(t_{1}=t_{2}\\); or \\((((Fa)\\) at \\(t) \\amp((Gb)\\) at \\(t)\n\\amp(F\\) is incompatible with \\(G))\\) implies not \\(a=b\\). One thus\ncannot rest with a minimalist position. At least Lewis\u2019 has the\nmerit of providing a viable semantics, a direct parallel with\ncounterpart theory in modal semantics. Of course, the basic ontology\nof Lewis\u2019 favoured position was Dharmakirti\u2019s though Lewis\ndid not note that fact. More to the point, Dharmakirti\u2019s\nstrategy did not depend on the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction. The\nproblem of contradictory attributions occurs even if the attributions\nare extrinsic, and Dharmakirti\u2019s argument is a straightforward\napplication of Leibniz\u2019 law to things-at-a-time. If time-slices\nare admitted at all, and it is hard not to do so if they are\nsanctioned by relativity theory, then Dharmakirti\u2019s argument\ngoes through. \n\n\nOthers have taken a different course on the issue of the consistency\nof change. Herakleitos (C6th BCE) wrote in a suggestive fashion, with\nhis doctrine of the unity of opposites. However, his few surviving\nsentences are too obscure and fragmentary to give much confidence in\ninterpretation. He spoke of the same river having different waters at\ndifferent times, but there is no development of the\nobservation. Similarly he spoke of the sea as being at one time both\nlife-preserving (to fish) and death-dealing (to humans), and\n\u201cthe path up and the path down are one and the same.\u201d These\nexamples hardly force one to believe in true contradictions,\nhowever.\n\n\nThere is also in Herakleitos the idea that everything is in a state\nof flux, always changing, and that it is the struggle between\nopposites (opposed tendencies) which drives change. This can be seen\nas an early version of the Marxist dynamic of dialectical\nmaterialism. But without a separate argument for the inconsistency of\nchange, there is no reason to think that it remains anything but a\nformally consistent theory.\n\n\nHegel was more explicit. In The Science of Logic he said\nthat only insofar as something has contradiction in itself does it\nmove, have impulse or activity. Indeed, movement is existing\ncontradiction itself. \u201cSomething moves not because at one moment\nof time it is here and at another there, but because at one and the\nsame moment it is here and not here.\u201d (Hegel (1812) p. 440).\n\n\nThere is something appealing in this argument. As Priest and Routley\nput it, \u201cin change\u2026 there is at each stage a moment when\nthe changing item is both in a given state, because it has just\nreached that state, but also not in that state, because it is not\nstationary but moving through and beyond that state\u201d (Priest,\nRoutley and Norman, 1989, p. 7). Think of a body coming to rest at a\ngiven time, and compare it with the same body proceeding on to\nfurther motion. There must be something about the body at that\ninstant which distinguishes the two scenarios, or there could be\nnothing at the time to count as continuing change. Cause cannot do\nit, for a body can continue in its state of motion without being\nimpressed by an external force, as Newton taught us. Nor can mere\nvelocity do it, since velocity is a relation to surrounding\npoints. Indeed, there is no difference in velocity between a body\nmomentarily at rest, and a body at rest for a period around the\ninstant; yet one is changing and the other not.\n\n\nWe will look more closely at this argument in the next\nsection. However, here we can remind ourselves of Hegel\u2019s\nidealism. Just about everyone agrees that contradictions within ideas\nare easier to swallow than contradictions in the external world. In\nthe special case of the phenomenology of motion, it is not such an\nabsurd speculation that what distinguishes the direct perception of\nmotion from the mere static memory of difference in position, is that\nnearby small variations in the stimulus are read into a kind of\nbuffer where they are not compared as static memory does so much as\noverlapped or superimposed in the way that contradictions are. After\nall, we are not at all good at discriminating small intervals of\ntime, as the success of 25 frames per second makes apparent. Thus,\nthe mind constructs a kind of contradictory theory which undergoes\nconstant update. Indeed, this may well be the source of the\ntroublesome intuition we noted earlier, that it is one and the same\nthing which endures through change, even though it is acknowledged\nthat it has different properties at different (nearby) times. If this\nis right, then if one thinks with Hegel that the world is a kind of\nidea, then the contradictoriness of ideas such as motion is apt to\nspill over to the contradictoriness of their realisations in the\nworld. Indeed, even without the assumption of full-blown idealism,\nthere is always the caution that if a theory (consistent or not) can\nbe made out which describes an epistemic state, i.e., a cognitive\nstate, then how can we be entirely confident that the world simply\ncould not be that way? \n\n\nTaking a far less ambitious view than Hegel, Von Wright (1968)\nnonetheless proposed an interesting account of conditions in which\nchange would have to be regarded as inconsistent. The account\nrequires two conditions. The first condition is that time is regarded\nas structured as nested intervals rather than an assemblage of atomic\npoint-instants. This is an attractive proposal, if only because\nno-one has ever seen a temporal or spatial point. Of course, standard\nrelativity theory proposes that spacetime is punctate, as does the\nusual mathematics of the continuum. But a successful non-punctate\nmathematics using intervals instead can be worked out, albeit with\nconsiderably extra complexity. (see e.g., Weyl 1960). Now in the\nontology of intervals, since there are no atomic points to attach a\nunique proposition to, the most one can say is that a proposition\nholds somewhere in the interval, with the limiting case that it holds\nthroughout the interval.\n\n\nVon Wright\u2019s second condition was then to suppose that an interval\nmight be so structured that a given proposition \\(p\\) and its\nnegation \\(\\neg p\\) are dense in each other throughout the\ninterval. This means that no subinterval, no matter how small, can be\nfound in which just \\(p\\) holds throughout that subinterval, and\nno subinterval can be found in which just \\(\\neg p\\) holds\nthroughout the subinterval: every subinterval in which one holds, the\nother holds as well. From an external point of view admitting\ninstants, we can see that this is a genuine consistent possibility, if\nfor example we think of\n\\(p\\) as the proposition that a rational number of seconds has\npassed, and \\(\\neg p\\) as the proposition that an irrational\nnumber of seconds has passed. These are dense in each other on the\nclassical real line regarded as time. Thus, there is no subinterval\nwhich is purely \\(p\\) throughout and no subinterval which is\npurely \\(\\neg p\\) throughout.\n\n\nThis was von Wright\u2019s proposed account of a continuous change in\nan ontology of intervals. The state \\(\\neg p\\) changes continuously to\n\\(p\\) if there is a preceding interval which is \\(\\neg p\\) throughout,\nthen an interval with \\(\\neg p\\) and \\(p\\) dense in each other, then a\nsucceeding interval with p holding throughout. Von Wright described\nthis as a kind of inconsistency. Unfortunately it is not clear from\nhis written words whether he had in mind that the situation was\ninconsistent or only possibly inconsistent. His argument seems to be\nthis. In an ontology of intervals we begin with descriptions like\n\u201cIt rained here yesterday\u201d which means that it rained\nsometime here yesterday. The basic description is thus \u201c\\(p\\)\nholds (somewhere) in the interval \\(I\\).\u201d The special case where\n\\(p\\) holds throughout \\(I\\) is noted, where to hold throughout is for\nthere to be no subinterval in which \\(\\neg p\\) holds. Now\n\\(p\\)\u2019s holding in \\(I\\) is of course compatible with \\(\\neg\np\\)\u2019s holding in \\(I\\). But there is no contradiction here, as\nlong as there is a partition of \\(I\\) into subintervals such that\n\\(p\\) holds throughout the subinterval or \\(\\neg p\\) holds throughout\nthe subinterval. Thus if we take in that a disjunction holds in an\ninterval just in case there is a partition in which each of the\ndisjuncts holds throughout its subintervals, we can say that if there\nis such a partition for \\(p\\), then the law of excluded middle \\(p\n\\vee \\neg p\\) holds throughout the interval. Von Wright introduced the\nmodal operator \\(Np\\) for \u201cNecessarily \\(p\\).\u201d If we\ndefine \u201c\\(Np\\) holds in \\(I\\)\u201d to mean that \\(p\\) holds\nthroughout \\(I\\), we can say that if there is no continuous change in\nthe above sense, then Excluded Middle LEM holds necessarily, \\(N(p\n\\vee \\neg p)\\). However, defining the modal \u201cPossibly\u201d in\nthe usual way as \\(M =df \\neg N\\neg\\) and assuming de Morgan\u2019s\nLaws, Double Negation and Commutativity, we get the result that in an\ninterval in which there is continuous change, \\(M(p \\amp \\neg p)\\)\nholds, i.e.. a contradiction is possible. Presumably it further\nfollows that in a subinterval which has continuous change throughout,\n\\(N(p \\amp \\neg p)\\) holds. Needless to say this implies that a\ncontradiction is true in that subinterval. We might note that the\nresult that continuous change is a true contradiction follows without\nthe detour through modal logic, since if LEM is false then \\(\\neg(p\n\\vee \\neg p)\\) holds for some \\(p\\), and so by de Morgan and Double\nNegation, \\(p \\amp \\neg p\\) holds (throughout).\n\n\nThis ingenious construction has its problems. It is certainly\ndangerous to assume De Morgan\u2019s Laws and Double Negation when the\nlogic of intervals is the case in point. They both fail for open set\nlogic, which is to say intuitionism, just as they both fail for its\ntopological dual, closed set logic. On the other hand, what is one to\nsay if the world is structured as intervals, non-punctate, and if\nthere are subintervals in which propositions and their negations are\ndense in each other, interspersed with intervals where one of the\npropositions holds throughout? The latter are clearly periods of\nnon-change, and the former are reasonably described as intervals of\nchange. And yet it would seem that the best one can do is to say that\n\\(p \\amp \\neg p\\) holds in the transition periods: there\nappears to be no consistent way of describing what is happening in the\nsituation which adheres to intervals and eschews points.\n",
