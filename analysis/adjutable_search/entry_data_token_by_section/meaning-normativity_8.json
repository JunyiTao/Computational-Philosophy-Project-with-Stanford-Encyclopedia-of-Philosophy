    "main_text": "Content || Content Determining Normativity\n4. Concluding Remarks: Normativism and Naturalism\n\nThe idea that the normative in some sense is not part of nature goes\nback at least to Kant (see, for instance, Critique of Pure\nReason [1781 [A 547]]). Already Hume (in the Treatise\n[1739\u20131740]) argued against the metaethical naturalist that\nought cannot be derived from is\u2014to try to do\nso would be to commit a so-called \u201cnaturalistic fallacy\u201d.\nWith the \u201copen question argument\u201d, Moore (in Principia\nEthica [1903]) added a weapon to the anti-naturalist\u2019s\narsenal also against giving naturalistic accounts of moral\nevaluations: According to the open question argument, there is no\nnaturalistic (set of) concept(s) analytically equivalent to the moral\nconcept of goodness, since no matter what naturalistic definition is\ngiven, the question whether all and only things satisfying it are good\nstill makes sense. Much of recent normativism about meaning/content\ncontinues in this anti-naturalist tradition; many normativists about\nmeaning/content hold that the essential normativity of meaning/content\nmakes at least (fully) reductive naturalism untenable.\n\nMany have construed Kripke\u2019s Wittgenstein as saying exactly\nthat: it is part of his skeptical campaign against semantic facts in\ngeneral that such facts cannot be reduced to whatever precisely is\nallowed in a naturalistic supervenience base for meaning/content. An\nargument for this could take a weaker, intensionalist, and a stronger,\nextensionalist, form (cf. Boghossian 1989a: 532ff). The stronger\nargument concludes that no reductive naturalist account of\nmeaning/content will be extensionally correct: For any\nmeaning/concept, such an account will either include objects in its\nextension that, intuitively, do not belong there, or exclude objects\nfrom its extension that, intuitively, do belong there, or both. As we\nsaw above\n (section 2.2.1),\n this \u201cproblem of error\u201d is a problem for many\nnaturalistic accounts of meaning/content, but as such it does not yet\nhave anything to do with normativity. To that, the normativist could\nrespond that it is precisely because of their essential normativity\nthat no naturalistic account of meaning/content can be extensionally\ncorrect. The weaker argument grants extensional correctness, but\nargues that no naturalistic reduction will get the intension of the\nnotion of meaning/content right; it will inevitably miss the normative\ncharacter of what is semantically correct, its deontic or axiologic\ncharacteristics.\n\nDespite the normativists\u2019 argument, it seems fair to say that at\nthis point in time, the case from normativism against reductive\nnaturalism about meaning/content has not yet been fully made. To make\ntheir case, the semantic normativist could resort to adopting a\nmetaethical approach: arguments in the tradition of Hume and Moore\nmight well be adaptable to their case (cf. Miller 1998, 188ff;\nHattiangadi 2007, 38ff; Gibbard 2012; Zalabardo 2012). As Hattiangadi\nargues, though, the semantic normativist\u2019s case ends up being\nhostage to whatever controversial assumptions these arguments rely on\n(motivational internalism, for instance, might be such an issue), thus\nremoving normativism further from being the pre-theoretical constraint\non acceptable accounts of meaning/content that Kripke\u2019s skeptic\nmeant it to be. What\u2019s more, one might worry that the topic of\n\u201creduction\u201d is itself more nuanced than the normativist\nmakes it to be. As we have seen in\n section 2.2,\n it is still possible to argue that some (set of) dispositions might\nplay a role in meaning-determination. Alternatively, it is possible to\nendorse partially reductive accounts construing meaning/content as\ndetermined by a dispositional and a non-semantic, but normative,\ncomponent.\n\nFurthermore, even if normativism about meaning/content might exclude\n(fully) reductive naturalism about meaning/content, it should be noted\nthat adopting normativism would not seem to be the only option for the\nanti-reductivist (cf. Mulligan 1999: 136f; Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss\n2009: 63ff). What the normativist construes as norms or rules of\nmeaning/content, principles such as\n (CM)\n or inferential rules such as modus ponens, might also be construed in\na very different way: As, or in analogy with what Frege called\n\u201claws of truth\u201d (Frege 1918 [1986: 30]). In the same vein,\nHusserl called the \u201claws of logic\u201d \u201cideal\u201d\n(Husserl 1913: 56)). These \u201claws\u201d are neither\nprescriptions for thinking, nor nomological generalities of our\npsychology. Their \u201cvalidity\u201d or necessity is sui\ngeneris; if anything, it is what we might today call\n metaphysical.[61]\n",
