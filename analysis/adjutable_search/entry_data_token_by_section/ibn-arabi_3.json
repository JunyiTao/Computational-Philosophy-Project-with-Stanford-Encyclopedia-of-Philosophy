    "main_text": "Methodology || Deiformity\n2.2 Deiformity\n\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s basic project is to map out the\npossibilities of human becoming, to clarify the distinction between\nhaqq and b\u00e2til\u2014truth and falsehood,\nreality and unreality, right and wrong\u2014and to point his readers\ntoward perfection, that is, realization of the Real \u201cto the\nextent of human capacity\u201d (\u2018al\u00e2 qadr t\u00e2qat\nal-bashar), as the philosophers liked to put it. This in turn\nrequires becoming characterized by the divine names (al-takhalluq\nbi asm\u00e2\u2019 All\u00e2h), a process discussed by\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee among others and called by Avicenna\nal-ta\u2019alluh, being like unto God, or deiformity. God\ncreated human beings in the form of the name Allah itself, which is\ncalled \u201cthe all-comprehensive name\u201d (al-ism\nal-j\u00e2mi\u2018), because it is the referent of all other\ndivine names. Realization is then the process of actualizing knowledge\nof the Three Books and bringing the soul into perfect harmony with the\nReal, a harmony that becomes apparent in the transformation of\ncharacter and the flowering of virtue. The science of\n\u201cethics\u201d (akhl\u00e2q, pl. of khuluq,\ncharacter) does not concern itself simply with knowledge of right\nbehavior, but aims rather at understanding the soul\u2019s rootedness\nin the divine names and mapping out the path of becoming characterized\nby them. The Koran sets up Muhammad as the perfect model here with the\nwords it directs at him, \u201cYou have a magnificent character\n[khuluq \u2018az\u00eem]\u201d (68:4). This can be nothing\nbut the full realization of the divine speech, \u201cthe magnificent\nKoran\u201d (al-qur\u2019\u00e2n al-\u2018az\u00eem,\n15:87). According to Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee, this is why\nMuhammad\u2019s wife \u2018\u00c2\u2019isha said about him,\n\u201cHis character was the Koran.\u201d\n",
