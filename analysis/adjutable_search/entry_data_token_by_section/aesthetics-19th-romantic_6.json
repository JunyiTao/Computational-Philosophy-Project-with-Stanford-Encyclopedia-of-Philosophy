    "main_text": "Aesthetics, Epistemology and Metaphysics || Sui-Generis Normativity\n3.3 Sui-Generis Normativity\n\nThe non-determining character of aesthetic feeling is related to the\ndistinctive kind of normativity that characterizes artistic production\nand aesthetic appreciation. An expression borrowed from Kant is\nfitting here: on the romantic picture, both artistic production and\naesthetic appreciation are \u201clawful without a law\u201d. Both\nare the source of their own normativity, without being subject to any\nexternal law. Given that, they are appropriate for approximating the\nAbsolute insofar as this approximation must be non-determining\n(applying no conditions), but normatively governed rather than\narbitrary.\n\nFollowing Kant\u2019s account of the genius, the romantics developed\nan understanding of the artist as, on the one hand, original and\nimaginative (rather than submitting to any law of nature or principle\nborrowed from the tradition of art), and, on the other hand, receptive\nto nature: \u201cEvery good poem must be wholly intentional and\nwholly instinctive\u201d (F. Schlegel, CF: #23). This combination of\nbeing independent of given rules and attuned to\nsomething other than yourself is required not only for the genius, but\nalso for approximating the Absolute. And it is this requirement that\nexplains \u201cthe categorical imperative of genius[:] You should\ndemand genius from everyone\u201d (F. Schlegel, CF: #16). If everyone\nis to approximate the Absolute, then everyone should model herself\nafter the genius.\n\nCriticism consists of a related combination of features. While it is\nbased on no prior rules, it is also open and receptive to the work it\nconcerns. And it is through the engagement with the work that each\ncritical judgment constitutes its own norms. Although we can and\nshould legitimize our judgments of beauty and art, we cannot do so by\nappeal to any given concepts or norms that are external to the work at\nstake. The artwork, on this picture, is sui generis\u2014it\nprovides its own standards of appreciation: \u201cPoetry is a\nrepublican speech: a speech which is its own law and end unto\nitself\u201d (F. Schlegel, CF: #65). The critic should seek to\nexpress the work in a way that is faithful to its individual nature\nand be responsive to the specific norms that it constitutes:\n\n\nTo judge [Goethe\u2019s Wilhelm Meister] according to an\nidea of genre drawn from custom and belief, accidental experiences and\narbitrary demands is as if a child tried to clutch the stars and the\nmoon in his hand and pack them in his satchel\u2026. Fortunately,\n[the novel] turns out to be one of those books, which carries its own\njudgment within it. (F. Schlegel, WM: 275)\n\n\nThat means that beauty makes demands on us, demands that, according to\nthe romantics, are analogous to the demands that other persons make on\nus. Beautiful objects make a claim on us to respond to them as the\nspecific individuals that they are, on their own terms: \u201cSee\nyour statues, your paintings, your friends as they are\u201d\n(Diderot, Salon of 1767). Hence, the romantic declaration,\n\u201cone cannot really speak of poetry except in the language of\npoetry\u201d (F. Schlegel, DP). \n\nThis lawfulness without a law fits the requirements of the Absolute.\nFor, if we adopt this structure of normativity and expression in our\npursuit of the Absolute, we may approach it in a normatively governed\nand committed way, without determining and thus conditioning it\naccording to any given law, principle, or concept. Here, then, is\nanother reason why philosophy should become poetic, and the true\nphilosopher, not merely a \u201chalf critic\u201d (as the romantics\nalleged against Kant), but a complete critic: philosophy should be\nopen and attuned to the Absolute without trying to subsume it under\nany principle of reason, just as criticism is open and attuned to each\nwork without subsuming it under any external\n law.[5]\n",
