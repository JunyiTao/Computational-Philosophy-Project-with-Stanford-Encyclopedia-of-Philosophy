A theory is called\ndecidable if the set of its theorems (sentences derivable in\nit) is decidable, that is (by the Church-Turing thesis) recursive.\nOtherwise, the theory is undecidable. Informally, being decidable\nmeans that there is a mechanical procedure which enables one to decide\nwhether an arbitrary given sentence (of the language of the theory) is\na theorem or not.\n\nIf a theory is complete, it is decidable (proof sketch: given a\nsentence \\(A\\), systematically generate the theorems of the theory;\nby completeness, eventually either \\(A\\) or \\(\\neg A\\) will be\nproduced in a finite time). The converse, though, does not always\nhold: there are incomplete theories which are decidable. Nevertheless,\nincompleteness at least opens the possibility of undecidability.\nMoreover, all theories which contain Robinson arithmetic\nQ (either directly, or Q can be\ninterpreted in them) are both incomplete and undecidable. Thus, for a\nvery wide class of theories, incompleteness and undecidability go hand\nin hand.\n\nOne elegant and simple way of demonstrating the undecidability of\nextensions of Q goes, roughly, as follows: Let \\(F\\) be any\nconsistent theory that contains Q.  Assume then that the set of\nits theorems is decidable, that is (by the Church-Turing thesis),\nrecursive. It would then follow that the set (of the G\u00f6del\nnumbers) of the theorems of \\(F\\) is strongly representable\nin \\(F\\) itself. Recall that this means that there is some formula\n\\(B(x)\\) of the language of \\(F\\) such that not only \\(F \\vdash\nB(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner)\\) whenever \\(F \\vdash A\\) (which even weak\nrepresentability guarantees), but also that \\(F \\vdash \\neg\nB(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner)\\) whenever \\(F \\not\\vdash A\\). However, the\ntechnique used in the proof of the first incompleteness theorem also\nshows that there are always sentences for which the latter does not\nhold: it is possible to construct a G\u00f6del sentence \\(G^B\\)\nrelative to \\(B(x)\\) for \\(F\\) such that:\n\n\\[\\tag{D}\nF \\vdash G^B \\leftrightarrow \\neg B(\\ulcorner G^B\\urcorner).\n\\]\n\n\nAs before, it follows that \\(F \\not\\vdash G^B\\). It\nhas been assumed that \\(B(x)\\) strongly represents the set\nof theorems, so this entails \\(F \\vdash \\neg B(\\ulcorner G^B \\urcorner)\\),\nand therefore, by (D), \\(F \\vdash G^B\\), a contradiction. Therefore, \\(F\\) must\nbe undecidable. \n\nA theory \\(F\\) is called essentially undecidable if every\nconsistent extension of it in the language of \\(F\\) is undecidable.\nThe above proof sketch in fact establishes that Q is\nessentially undecidable. (There are some very weak theories that are\nundecidable but not essentially undecidable.)\n\nRecall that Q has only finitely many axioms and let\n\\(A_Q\\) stand for the single sentence consisting\nof the conjunction of the axioms of Q. Then for any\nsentence \\(B\\) of the language of arithmetic,\n\n\\(\\mathbf{Q} \\vdash B\\) if and only if it is a theorem\nof first-order logic that \\(A_Q \\rightarrow B\\).\n\n\nBut then a decision procedure for first-order logic would provide a\ndecision method for Q. The latter, however, is\nimpossible, as it has already been shown. Therefore, it can be\nconcluded:\n\nChurch\u2019s Theorem\n\nFirst-order predicate logic is undecidable.\n\n\n(This undecidability result was first established by Church 1936a, b;\nthe method of deriving it via the undecidability of Q\nis due to Tarski, Mostowski and Robinson 1953.)\n\nSubsequently, a number of theories and problems from different areas\nof mathematics have been shown to be undedicable (see, e.g., Davis\n1977; Murawski 1999: Ch 3).\n4.3 Reflection Principles and L\u00f6b\u2019s Theorem\n\nHeuristically, one may view the G\u00f6del sentence\n\\(G_F\\) as expressing its own\nunprovability\u2014saying \u201cI am not\nprovable\u201d\u2014though, as was already emphasized, such claims\nshould be taken with a grain of salt. Leon Henkin put forward the\nquestion whether the sentence expressing its own provability\n(\u201cI am provable\u201d) is true or false, and provable or not\n(Henkin 1952). Georg Kreisel soon pointed out that this depends\nvitally on how provability is expressed; with different choices, one\ngets opposite answers (Kreisel 1953). \n\nThe paper of Martin Hugo L\u00f6b (1955), augmented by comments of a\nreferee, brought substantial advances on various fronts. First, it\nintroduces the now standard L\u00f6b derivability conditions discussed\npreviously in the context of the second incompleteness theorem.\nSecond, it contains L\u00f6b\u2019s solution of Henkin\u2019s\nproblem about sentences \u201cexpressing their own\nprovability\u201d. Third, it contains a generalization now called\n\u201cL\u00f6b\u2019s Theorem\u201d, but which L\u00f6b actually\ncredits to the anonymous referee (who happened to be none other than\nHenkin himself; the whole story is told in Smory\u0144ski 1991.)\n\nIn order to understand L\u00f6b\u2019s theorem properly it is useful\nto first consider the so-called \u201creflection principles\u201d.\nAbove, the focus has been on expressing, inside a formal system, that\nthe system is consistent, i.e., on \\(\\Cons(F)\\). But\nnaturally the theory should not merely be consistent but also\nsound, i.e., prove only true sentences. How should the\nsoundness of a system, i.e., the claim that everything derivable in\nthe system is true, be expressed? If one wants to express this in the\nlanguage of the system itself, it cannot be done by a single statement\nsaying this, because there is, by the undefinability of truth, no\nsuitable truth predicate available in the language. Various restricted\nand unrestricted soundness claims can, however, be expressed in the\nform of a scheme, the so-called Reflection Principles:\n\n\\[\\tag{Ref}\n\\Prov_F(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner) \\rightarrow A.\n\\]\n\n\nBy taking \\(A\\) to be \\(\\bot\\), and noting that \\(\\bot\\) is refutable\nin \\(F\\), it is easy to see that Reflection Principle entails the\nconsistency statement Cons\\((F)\\), i.e., \\(\\neg\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner \\bot\n\\urcorner)\\); hence it cannot be generally provable in the system.\n\nThe scheme can also be restricted. Equivalent to the assumption of\n1-consistency, or \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-soundness, for example, is the\nReflection Principle restricted to \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-sentences (i.e.,\nthe sentence \\(A\\) in the scheme is required to be a\n\\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-sentence.)  Or, it can be restricted to the universal\n\\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-sentences; and so forth.\n\nExactly which instances of the reflection scheme are actually provable\nin the system? L\u00f6b\u2019s Theorem gives a precise answer to this\nquestion (assuming that \\(\\Prov_F (x)\\)\nsatisfies the derivability conditions):\n\nL\u00f6b\u2019s Theorem\n\nLet \\(A\\) be any sentence of the language of \\(F\\). Then: \\(F\n\\vdash\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner A\\urcorner) \\rightarrow A\\) if, and only if,\n\\(F \\vdash A.\\)\n\n\nHence, the instances of soundness (reflection principle) provable in a\nsystem are exactly the ones which concern sentences which are\nthemselves provable in the system. As a consequence, this also settles\nHenkin\u2019s original problem: assuming that the arithmetized\nprovability predicate is again \u201cnormal\u201d (i.e., satisfies\nL\u00f6b\u2019s derivability conditions), all sentences\n\u201casserting their own provability\u201d are provable.\n\nActually, L\u00f6b\u2019s theorem can be proved quite quickly as a\nconsequence of the second incompleteness theorem. Kreisel has also\nnoted that, in the opposite direction, the second incompleteness\ntheorem can also be easily derived as a consequence of\nL\u00f6b\u2019s theorem.\n4.4 Hilbert\u2019s Tenth Problem and the MRDP Theorem\n\nThe tenth on Hilbert\u2019s famous list of important open problem in\nmathematics from 1900 asks for a decision method for the so-called\nDiophantine equations. Despite the unfamiliar term\n\u201cDiophantine,\u201d what is at issue here is truly elementary.\nConsider any equation with one or more variables and with integer\ncoefficients, which involves only addition and multiplication, such as\n\\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\), or \\(3x^2 + 5y^2 + 2xy = 0\\). If real-number\nsolutions are sought, one usually speaks simply about an\n\u201cequation\u201d. However, in number theory, typically a\nsolution is sought consisting only of integers. That makes a great\ndifference. The former of the above equations has infinitely many\nsolutions among real numbers, but only four among integers. The\nequation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 3\\) also has infinitely many real solutions but\nno integer solutions. When the focus is on the integer solutions, one\ntalks about \u201cDiophantine equations\u201d (after the ancient\nnumber theorist Diophantus of Alexandria). \n\nFor a positive solution of Hilbert\u2019s tenth problem, it would\nhave sufficed to present a particular concrete method which would have\nintuitively been a \u201cmechanical\u201d decision method. However,\nTuring\u2019s pioneering analysis of the notion of decision method\nbrought into focus the possibility of a negative solution. Beginning\nin the early 1950s, Julia Robinson and Martin Davis worked on this\nproblem, later joined by Hilary Putnam. As a result of their\ncollaboration, the first important result in this direction was\nachieved. Call an equation \u201can exponential Diophantine\nequation\u201d if it involves also exponentiation, as well as\naddition and multiplication (that is, one can have both constants and\nvariables as exponents); naturally, the focus is still in the integer\nsolutions. Davis, Putnam, and Robinson (1961), showed that the problem\nof solvability of exponential Diophantine equations is undecidable. In\n1970, Yuri Matiyasevich added the final missing piece, and\ndemonstrated that the problem of the solvability of Diophantine\nequations is undecidable. Hence the overall result is often called\nMRDP Theorem (for an exposition, see, e.g., Davis 1973; Matiyasevich\n1993).\n\nThe essential technical achievement was that all semi-decidable\n(recursively enumerable) sets can be given a Diophantine\nrepresentation, i.e., they can be represented by a simple formula of\nthe form \\(\\exists x_1 \\ldots \\exists x_n (s = t)\\), where \\((s = t)\\)\nis a Diophantine equation. More exactly, for any given recursively\nenumerable set \\(S\\), there is a Diophantine equation \\((s(y, x_1 ,\n\\ldots ,x_n) = t(y, x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n))\\) such that \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\n\\in S\\) if and only if \\(\\exists x_1 \\ldots \\exists x_n\n(s(\\underline{n}, x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n) = t(\\underline{n}, x_1 , \\ldots\n,x_n))\\).\n\nAs there are semi-decidable (recursively enumerable) sets which are\nnot decidable (recursive), the general conclusion follows immediately:\n\n\nMRDP Theorem\n\nThere is no general method for deciding whether or not a given\nDiophantine equation has a solution.\n\n\nThis also provides an elegant variant of the incompleteness theorems\ndealing with Diophantine equations:\n\nCorollary\n\nFor any 1-consistent axiomatizable formal system \\(F\\) there are\nDiophantine equations which have no solutions but cannot be proved in\n\\(F\\) to have no solutions.\n\n\n(The question of avoiding the requirement of 1-consistency here is\ntricky; see Dyson, Jones and Shepherson 1982.)\n4.5 Concrete Cases of Unprovable Statements\n\nThe undecidable sentences provided by G\u00f6del\u2019s proofs are\n(if written out) extremely complicated formulas with no intuitive\nsignificance, construed only for the purposes of the incompleteness\nproofs. The question then arises whether there are any simple and\nnatural mathematical statements which are likewise undecidable in\nchosen basic theories, e.g., in PA. There are now\nvarious specific statements with clear mathematical content which are\nknown to be undecidable in some standard theories (though, just how\nnatural even these are has been disputed; see Feferman 1989b). Some\nwell known, natural examples are listed below, beginning with some\nquite natural mathematical statements which are independent of\nPA, and proceeding to more and more powerful\ntheories. Sometimes such results are called variants of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorem, or their proofs of independence\nalternative proofs of G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem, but this is\nmisleading: interesting as they may be, they don\u2019t have the\ngenerality of G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems proper, but only provide\nstatements independent of a particular theory.\n\nIt is often stated that before the celebrated Paris-Harrington theorem\n(see below), no such natural independent mathematical statements were\nknown. This is not, however, strictly speaking, correct. Already much\nearlier, around 1935, Gerhard Gentzen (see the entry on the\n development of proof theory)\n had provided such a statement. It is very natural to generalize the\nidea of induction from the domain of natural numbers to the domain of\nordinal numbers. In set theory, such generalizations are called\nprinciples of transfinite induction. Though some constructivists may\nbe sceptical about the legitimacy of full set theory, there are\nlimited and more concrete cases of transfinite induction (only dealing\nwith some well-defined classes of countable ordinals) that are\nperfectly acceptable even from the constructivist or intuitionist\nviewpoint. One important case is the principle of transfinite\ninduction up to the ordinal called \\(\\varepsilon_0\\). Gentzen\nshowed that the consistency of PA can be proved if\nthis transfinite induction principle is assumed. Therefore, because of\nthe second incompleteness theorem, the principle itself cannot be\nprovable in PA (Gentzen 1936).\n\nRamsey\u2019s theorem is a result in infinitary combinatorics,\nestablished by Frank Ramsey (1930), and deals with possibilities of\n\u201ccolouring\u201d for certain graphs. Jeff Paris and Leo\nHarrington formulated a finitary variant of Ramsey\u2019s theorem,\nand showed that it is not provable in PA (Paris &\nHarrington 1977). This provides a quite natural statement of finite\ncombinatorics which is independent of PA. Perhaps an\neven cleaner example is Goodstein\u2019s theorem, due to Reuben\nGoodstein (1944), which is purely number theoretic in nature. First\none defines a certain natural class of sequences of natural numbers,\nnow called \u201cGoodstein sequences\u201d. The theorem states that\nevery Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at 0. Goodstein\u2019s\ntheorem is certainly a natural mathematical statement, for it was\nformulated and proved (obviously by proof methods that go beyond\nPA) by Goodstein long before (that is, in 1944) it\nwas shown, in 1982, that the theorem is not provable in\nPA (Kirby & Paris 1982). \n\nMoving now to stronger theories beyond PA, one can\nmention, for example, Kruskal\u2019s Theorem. This is a theorem which\nconcerns certain orderings of finite trees (Kruskal 1960). Harvey\nFriedman showed that this theorem is unprovable even in subsystems of\nsecond-order arithmetic much stronger than PA (see\nSimpson 1985). In particular, it is not provable in any theory which\nis predicatively justified (under a widely accepted explication of\n\u201cpredicative\u201d, cf. the section on predicativism in the\nentry on the\n philosophy of mathematics).\n\nThere are some concrete examples of mathematical statements undecided\neven in stronger theories which come from the so-called descriptive\nset theory. This field of mathematics is related to topology and was\ninitiated by the French semi-intuitionists (Lebesgue, Baire, Borel;\nsee the section on descriptive set theory, etc., in the entry on\n intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics).\n It studies sets which possess relatively simple definitions (in\ncontradistinction to the ideas of arbitrary sets and various higher\npower-sets, which the semi-intuitionists rejected as meaningless)\ncalled projective or analytic sets. Classically these were defined as\nthe sets that can be built up from a countable intersection of open\nsets by taking continuous images and complements finitely many times;\nthey coincide with the sets which are definable in the language of\nP\\(^2\\). In particular, the so-called Borel sets can\nbe simply defined both by a formula of the form \\(\\exists XA(x)\\) and\nby a formula of the form \\(\\forall XB(x)\\), where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) do\nnot contain any set variables (in logician\u2019s terminology, Borel\nsets are the \\(\\Delta^{1}_1\\) sets). A Borel function is defined\nanalogously (see, e.g., Martin 1977).\n\nHarvey Friedman has established the following theorem: roughly, if\n\\(S\\) is a Borel set, then there exists a Borel function \\(f\\)\nsuch that the graph of \\(f\\) is either included in or disjoint from\n\\(S\\). Friedman showed that this simple-sounding theorem is not\nprovable even in full second-order arithmetic\nP\\(^2\\), but proving it necessarily requires\nthe full power of ZFC (see Simpson 1999: 23).\n\nFurther, it was a traditional question of descriptive set theory (a\nquestion which can be formulated in the language of second order\narithmetic) whether all projective sets (see above) are Lebesque\nmeasurable. This remained an open problem for many decades, and for a\ngood reason: it turned out that the statement is independent even of\nthe full ZFC set theory (see Solovay 1970). Only by\npostulating the existence of some extremely large cardinals (so-called\nWoodin cardinals) can the hypothesis that all projective sets are\nLebesque measurable be proved (this was achieved as a consequence of\ntheir work on so-called projective determinacy by Woodin, Martin and\nSteel; see Woodin 1988; Martin & Steel 1988, 1989). \n\nSometimes Paul Cohen\u2019s celebrated result that the Continuum\nHypothesis (CH) is independent of ZFC (Cohen 1963,\n1964; see the entry on\n independence and large cardinals).\n However, this case is very different. In all the above independence\nresults the relevant statements are still theorems of mathematics,\ntaken as shown to be true (the last case, which requires large\ncardinal axioms that go beyond ZFC, is more\ncontroversial; still, at least many set-theoreticians find such axioms\nplausible). And with the first incompleteness theorem itself, the\ntruth of the unprovable statement easily follows, given that the\nassumption of the consistency of the system is indeed correct.\nHowever, in the case of Cohen\u2019s result, there is absolutely no\nindication whether CH should be considered true, false, or perhaps\nlacking a truth-value. \n5. The History and Early Reception of the Incompleteness Theorems\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s results were certainly surprising, but some sort of\nincompleteness phenomenon was not totally unexpected. The possibility\nof incompleteness in the context of set theory was discussed by\nBernays and Tarski already in 1928, and von Neumann, in contrast to\nthe dominant spirit in Hilbert\u2019s program, had considered it\npossible that logic and mathematics were not decidable. G\u00f6del\nhimself had mentioned the possibility of an undecidable problem\nconcerning real numbers in his thesis in 1929 (see Dawson 1985).\nHilbert (1928), on the other hand, had assumed that Peano Arithmetic\nand other standard theories were complete. Apparently G\u00f6del was\nalso impressed by Brouwer, who in his lecture in Vienna in 1928 had\nsuggested that mathematics is inexhaustible and cannot be completely\nformalized (see Wang 1987, 84; and the section on Brouwer\u2019s view\nof the formalist program in the entry on\n the development of intuitionistic logic).\n\nBe that as it may, it seems that G\u00f6del actually arrived at the\nfirst exact observations about incompleteness via a different route,\nduring his attempts to contribute to Hilbert\u2019s program,\nand not to undermine it (see Dawson 1997: Ch. IV). Namely, in 1930,\nG\u00f6del made an effort to advance Hilbert\u2019s program by\nattempting to prove the consistency of analysis (or, second-order\narithmetic) with the resources of arithmetic, and thus reduce the\nconsistency of the former to the consistency of the latter. In his\nattempted proof, he needed the notion of truth. G\u00f6del soon faced\nvarious paradoxes (such as the Liar paradox), and had to conclude that\narithmetical truth cannot be defined in arithmetic. Hence, G\u00f6del\nfirst arrived at a version of the undefinability of truth theorem,\nusually associated with Tarski (cf. Murawski 1998). This also easily\nyields a weak version of the incompleteness result: the set of\nsentences provable in arithmetic can be defined in the language of\narithmetic, but the set of true arithmetical sentences cannot;\ntherefore the two cannot coincide. Moreover, under the assumption that\nall provable sentences are true, it follows that there must be true\nsentences which are not provable. This approach, though, does not\nexhibit any particular such sentence.\n\nHowever, the intellectual environment of G\u00f6del was that of the\nVienna Circle with its radically anti-metaphysical attitude. In\nparticular, even the notion of truth was considered as suspicious or\neven nonsensical at the time, at least by some logical positivists\n(e.g., Neurath, Hempel). Therefore, G\u00f6del worked hard to\neliminate any appeal to the notion of truth and attempted to do\nwithout it. He therefore introduced the notion of \\(\\omega\\)-consistency,\nwhich can be defined rigorously and purely syntactically. This led to\nthe incompleteness theorems in the form that they are now known.\n\nAs to the Diagonalization Lemma, actually G\u00f6del himself\noriginally demonstrated only a special case of it, that is, only for\nthe provability predicate. The general lemma was apparently first\ndiscovered by Carnap 1934 (see G\u00f6del 1934, 1935). Still more\ngeneral versions, for formulas with free variables, were presented in\nEhrenfeucht & Feferman 1960 and Montague 1962 (see Smory\u0144ski\n1981).\n\nThe reception of G\u00f6del\u2019s results was mixed. Some important\nfigures in the field of logic and the foundations of mathematics quite\nquickly assimilated the results and understood their relevance, but\nthere was also quite a lot of misunderstanding and resistance (for\ndetailed accounts of the reception, see Dawson 1985; Mancosu\n1999).\n\nG\u00f6del revealed his results to Carnap in Vienna on 26 August 1930,\nand announced his result (the first theorem) in a casual discussion\nremark in the famous K\u00f6nigsberg Conference on September 7, 1930.\nJohn von Neumann, who was in the audience and was at the time working\nin the context of Hilbert\u2019s program, immediately understood the\ngreat importance of the result. On 20 November he wrote a letter to\nG\u00f6del on a \u201cremarkable\u201d corollary of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s result he had discovered: the unprovability of\nconsistency (the second theorem). Meanwhile G\u00f6del himself,\nhowever, had found the same idea and had already sent the final\nversion of his article, which now contained also a statement of the\nsecond incompleteness theorem, for publication. The article was\npublished in January 1931 (G\u00f6del 1931; helpful introductions to\nG\u00f6del\u2019s original paper are Kleene 1986 and Zach 2005). The\nword quickly started to spread of these results which apparently had\ngreat importance for the foundations of mathematics\u2014though views\non what really was the moral varied. Paul Bernays, perhaps the most\nimportant collaborator of Hilbert, showed great interest in the\nresults, though he first had difficulties in understanding them\nproperly. His active correspondence with G\u00f6del also shows that\nG\u00f6del was already at the time fully aware of the undefinability\nof truth.\n\nAs G\u00f6del\u2019s original approach focused on his specific though\nvery comprehensive system P and its (primitive\nrecursive) extensions, some doubted the generality of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s results. Alonzo Church, for example, in a letter to\nG\u00f6del in July 1932, suggested that G\u00f6del\u2019s results\nwould not apply to his system of \\(\\lambda\\)-conversion (the system was\nlater proved to be inconsistent by Kleene and Rosser). G\u00f6del was\nanxious to generalize his discoveries, and extended the results to a\nwider class of systems in papers in 1932 and 1934. He also suggested\nthat his methods would be applicable to standard systems of set theory\n(however, it was only after the satisfactory characterization of\ndecidability and the Church-Turing thesis a few years later that it\nwas possible to give a fully general formulation of the incompleteness\ntheorems (see above); this was first done in Kleene 1936). The eminent\nset-theorist Ernst Zermelo directed some rather harsh criticism\ntowards G\u00f6del\u2019s work, but the two also corresponded on the\ntopic. Zermelo seems to have had serious difficulties in understanding\nthe relevant concepts and results.\n\nIn March 1933, G\u00f6del received a letter from Paul Finsler, from\nZ\u00fcrich, who suggested that he had already earlier (in Finsler\n1926) done closely related work but with a more general relevance.\nG\u00f6del replied that Finsler\u2019s system was not really defined\nat all. In his heated response, Finsler claimed that it was not\nnecessary to be able to study a system for it to be sharply defined,\nand that there was no difference in principle between his ideas and\nG\u00f6del\u2019s. In retrospect, it is quite clear that the\napproaches of Finsler and G\u00f6del were very different: for\nG\u00f6del\u2019s work, the notion of formalized system was\nessential, whereas Finsler rejected the very notion as artificially\nrestrictive. In fact, it is far from clear that Finsler\u2019s ideas\nmake any sense\u2014whatever vague analogies there may be between\nthem and G\u00f6del\u2019s proof.\n\nOn the other hand, it is fair to say that Emil Post had in some\nrespects anticipated G\u00f6del\u2019s discoveries. He obtained\nabstract versions of incompleteness results apparently already in\n1922. In particular, he observed that his methods would provide a\nstatement undecidable in Principia Mathematica. These results\nwere, however, based on Post\u2019s own version of the\n\u201cChurch-Turing thesis\u201d, with which he was dissatisfied,\nand his work was left unpublished. It was reported much later in (Post\n1941). \n\nThe correctness of G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems remained the subject of\nlively debate throughout the 1930s (see Dawson 1985). In 1939, Hilbert\nand Bernays\u2019 second volume of Die Grundlagen der\nMathematik appeared, including a detailed proof of the second\nincompleteness theorem. Thereafter, serious opposition to\nG\u00f6del\u2019s conclusions disappeared at least among those who\nwere working actively in mathematical logic and the foundations of\nmathematics. However, in more philosophical circles, some resistance\nremained. Most famously, Wittgenstein made some critical remarks\nconcerning G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem in his posthumously published\nRemarks on the Foundations of Mathematics. The dominant initial\nreaction was that Wittgenstein simply failed to understand the result.\nMore charitable interpretations have emerged, and the debate is still\nvery much alive (see the section on G\u00f6del and undecidable\npropositions in the entry on\n Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy of mathematics).\n6. Philosophical Implications\u2014Real and Alleged\n6.1 Philosophy of Mathematics\n\nOf the various fields of philosophy, G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems are\nobviously most immediately relevant for the philosophy of mathematics.\nTo begin with, they pose, at least prima facie, serious\nproblems for Hilbert\u2019s program (this issue is discussed in some\ndetail in the section on the impact of incompleteness in the entry on\n Hilbert\u2019s Program).\n Then again, they have important consequences for intuitionism\n(see the entry on\n intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics)\n (see also G\u00f6del 1933, 1941; Raatikainen 2005).\n\nThere has been some dispute on the issue as to whether\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems conclusively refute logicism (see\nthe entry on\n logicism).\n Henkin (1962) and Musgrave (1977), for example, argue it does;\nSternfeld (1976) and Rodr\u00edguez-Consuegra (1993) disagree (see\nalso Hellman 1981; Raatikainen 2005).\n\nG\u00f6del himself developed an argument against the conventionalist\nphilosophy of mathematics of logical positivism, and of Carnap\u2019s\nin particular, based on the incompleteness results (G\u00f6del\n1953/9). It is discussed in Goldfarb and Ricketts 1992; Ricketts 1995;\nGoldfarb 1995; Crocco 2003; Awodey & Carus 2003, 2004; Tennant\n2008. \n6.2 Self-evident and analytical truths\n\nOne can also give more general epistemological interpretations of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems. Quine and Ullian (1978), for example,\nconsider the traditional philosophical picture that all truths could\nbe proved by self-evident steps from self-evident truths and\nobservation. They then point out that even the truths of elementary\nnumber theory are presumably not in general derivable by self-evident\nsteps from self-evident truths (Quine & Ullian 1978: 64\u201365.)\nHilary Putnam (1975) in turn submits that, under a certain natural\nunderstanding of \u201canalytic\u201d, there must be, by\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems, synthetic truths in mathematics. In fact,\nG\u00f6del himself made remarks in a very similar spirit that even the\ntheory of integers is demonstrably non-analytic (G\u00f6del 1944).\n6.3 \u2018G\u00f6delian\u2019 arguments against mechanism\n\nThere have been repeated attempts to apply G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems\nto demonstrate that the powers of the human mind outrun any mechanism\nor formal system. Such a G\u00f6delian argument against mechanism was\nconsidered, if only in order to refute it, already by Turing in the\nlate 1940s (see Piccinini 2003). An unqualified anti-mechanist\nconclusion was drawn from the incompleteness theorems in a widely read\npopular exposition, G\u00f6del\u2019s Theorem, by Nagel and\nNewman (1958). Shortly afterwards, J.R. Lucas (1961) famously\nproclaimed that G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem\n\n\nproves that Mechanism is false, that is, that minds cannot be\nexplained as machines. \n\n\nHe stated that \n\n\ngiven any machine which is consistent and capable of doing simple\narithmetic, there is a formula it is incapable of producing as being\ntrue \u2026 but which we can see to be true.\n\n\nMore recently, very similar claims have been put forward by Roger\nPenrose (1989, 1994). John Searle (1997) has joined the discussion and\npartly defended Penrose against his critics. Crispin Wright (1994,\n1995) has endorsed related ideas from an intuitionistic point of view\n(for criticism, see Detlefsen 1995). They all insist that\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems imply that the human mind infinitely\nsurpasses the power of any finite machine or formal system.\n\nThese G\u00f6delian anti-mechanist arguments are, however,\nproblematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail. The standard\nresponse to this argument goes along the following lines (this\nobjection goes back to Putnam 1960; see also Boolos 1968, Shapiro\n1998): The argument assumes that for any formalized system, or a\nfinite machine, there exists the G\u00f6del sentence which is\nunprovable in that system, but which the human mind can see to be\ntrue. Yet G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem has in reality a conditional\nform, and the alleged truth of the G\u00f6del sentence of a system\ndepends on the assumption of the consistency of the system. The\nanti-mechanist\u2019s argument thus also requires that the human mind\ncan always see whether or not a given formalized theory is consistent.\nHowever, this is highly implausible (cf. Davis 1990). Lucas, Penrose\nand others have attempted to reply to such criticism (see, e.g., Lucas\n1996; Penrose 1995, 1997). For detailed criticism of Penrose, see\nBoolos 1990; Davis 1990, 1993; Feferman 1995; Lindstr\u00f6m 2001;\nPudl\u00e1k 1999; Shapiro 2003; many of these considerations are\nalso relevant for what Lucas says).\n6.4 G\u00f6del and Benacerraf on Mechanism and Platonism\n\nInterestingly, G\u00f6del himself also presented an anti-mechanist\nargument although it was more cautious and only published posthumously\n(in his Collected Works, Vol. III, in 1995). That is, in his\n1951 Gibbs lecture, G\u00f6del drew the following disjunctive\nconclusion from the incompleteness theorems: \n\n\neither \u2026 the human mind (even within the realm of pure\nmathematics) infinitely surpasses the power of any finite machine, or\nelse there exist absolutely unsolvable diophantine problems. \n\n\nG\u00f6del speaks about this statement as a \u201cmathematically\nestablished fact\u201d (G\u00f6del 1951; for more discussion on\nG\u00f6del\u2019s disjunctive claim, see, e.g., Shapiro 1998).\nAccording to G\u00f6del, the second alternative \n\n\nseems to disprove the view that mathematics is only our own creation\n\u2026 that mathematical objects and facts \u2026 exist\nobjectively and independently of our mental acts and decisions. \n\n\nG\u00f6del was nonetheless inclined to deny the possibility of\nabsolutely unsolvable problems, and although he did believe in\nmathematical Platonism, his reasons for this conviction were\ndifferent, and he did not maintain that the incompleteness theorems\nalone establish Platonism. Thus G\u00f6del believed in the first\ndisjunct, that the human mind infinitely surpasses the power of any\nfinite machine. Still, this conclusion of G\u00f6del follows, as\nG\u00f6del himself clearly explains, only if one denies, as does\nG\u00f6del, the possibility of humanly unsolvable problems. It is not\na necessary consequence of incompleteness theorems.\n\nNow G\u00f6del was, unlike the later advocates of the so-called\nG\u00f6delian anti-mechanist argument, sensitive enough to admit that\nboth mechanism and the alternative that there are humanly absolutely\nunsolvable problems are consistent with his incompleteness theorems.\nHis fundamental reasons for disliking the latter alternative are much\nmore philosophical. G\u00f6del thought in a somewhat Kantian way that\nhuman reason would be fatally irrational if it asked questions it\ncould not answer (for critical discussion, see Kreisel 1967; Boolos\n1995; Raatikainen 2005).\n\nAs a reaction to Lucas\u2019 argument, but before the publication of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s Gibbs Lecture, Paul Benacerraf (1967) put forward\nmore qualified conclusions that interestingly resemble some ideas of\nG\u00f6del. He argued that it is consistent with all the facts that I\nam indeed a Turing machine, but that I cannot ascertain which one. For\nsome critical discussion, see Chihara 1972 and Hanson 1971.\n6.5 Mysticism and the existence of God?\n\nSometimes quite fantastic conclusions are drawn from\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems. It has been even suggested that\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems, if not exactly prove, at least give\nstrong support for mysticism or the existence of God. These\ninterpretations seem to assume one or more misunderstandings which\nhave already been discussed above: it is either assumed that\nG\u00f6del provided an absolutely unprovable sentence, or that\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems imply Platonism, or anti-mechanism, or\nboth.\n\nFor more discussion about the philosophical aspects of the\nincompleteness theorems, see Raatikainen 2005 and Franz\u00e9n\n2005.\nFurther reading\n\nA standard reference for the incompleteness theorems is:\n\nSmory\u0144ski, C., 1977, \u201cThe incompleteness\ntheorems,\u201d in Handbook of Mathematical Logic, J.\nBarwise (ed.), Amsterdam: North-Holland, pp. 821\u2013866\n [available online].\n\n\nThere are several introductory textbooks in mathematical logic which\ngive a good exposition of the incompleteness theorems and related\ntopics; for example:\n\nBoolos, G., and R.
