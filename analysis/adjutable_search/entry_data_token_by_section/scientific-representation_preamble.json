    "main_text": "\n\nScience provides us with representations of atoms, elementary\nparticles, polymers, populations, pandemics, economies, rational\ndecisions, aeroplanes, earthquakes, forest fires, irrigation systems,\nand the world\u2019s climate. It\u2019s through these\nrepresentations that we learn about the world. This entry explores\nvarious different accounts of scientific representation, with a\nparticular focus on how scientific models represent their\ntarget systems. As philosophers of science are increasingly\nacknowledging the importance, if not the primacy, of scientific models\nas representational units of science, it\u2019s important to stress\nthat how they represent plays a fundamental role in how we are to\nanswer other questions in the philosophy of science (for instance in\nthe scientific realism debate). This entry begins by disentangling\n\u201cthe\u201d problem of scientific representation, and then\ncritically evaluates the current options available in the\nliterature.\n",
