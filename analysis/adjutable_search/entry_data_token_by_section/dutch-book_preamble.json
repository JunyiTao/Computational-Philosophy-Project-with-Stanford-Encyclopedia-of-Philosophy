    "main_text": "\n\nThe Dutch Book argument (DBA) for probabilism (namely the view that an\nagent\u2019s degrees of belief should satisfy the axioms of\nprobability) traces to Ramsey\u2019s work in \u201cTruth and\nProbability\u201d. He mentioned only in passing that an agent who\nviolates the probability axioms would be vulnerable to having a book\nmade against him and this has led to considerable debate and confusion\nboth about exactly what Ramsey intended to show and about if, and how,\na cogent version of the argument can be given. The basic idea behind\nthe argument has also been applied in defense of a variety of\nprinciples, some of which place additional constraints on an\nagent\u2019s current beliefs, with others, such as\nConditionalization, purporting to govern how degrees of belief should\nevolve over time.\n",
