    "main_text": "Quaker thought and practice || Liberty of conscience\n2.3 Liberty of conscience\n\n\nIn some of her writings, Fell provides religio-political defences of\nliberty of conscience (freedom of religious belief and worship) for\nQuakers. In a direct appeal to Charles II, Fell calls upon the king\n\n\n\nto a Consideration, according to Reason, Righteousness, and Equity,\nconcerning us, as a People, to maintain our just Liberties and Rights,\nas he is engaged by Promise, to defend us from Wrongs, Injuries, and\nViolence, done to us by Military and Merciless Men. (Fell 1710, 28)\n\n\n\nBy \u201cliberty\u201d here Fell means freedom from coercion and\npersecution for one\u2019s religious beliefs and practices. She\nlaments \u201cThat the State should pretend Love to the Truth, and yet\nsuffer such things to be of Force, that all Bloody Persecutors may have\ntheir Wills, so far as the Lord gives them Power, upon those that live\nin the Truth\u201d (Fell 1710, 43). Using gender-inclusive language,\nshe calls on the authorities to respect the rights of \u201cfree-born\nEnglish men and women\u201d (Fell 1664, 1). Unlike her fellow\nQuaker William Penn (who anticipates the tolerationist views of John\nLocke), Fell does not offer detailed arguments for liberty of\nconscience based on pragmatic, political, or epistemological\nprinciples. She does point out, however, that \u201cto use Violence\nand Cruelty, is absolutely contrary to the Doctrine and Command of\nChrist\u201d (Fell 1667b, 45). She calls upon the political\nauthorities to exemplify the Christian virtues in their treatment of\nreligious dissenters.\n",
