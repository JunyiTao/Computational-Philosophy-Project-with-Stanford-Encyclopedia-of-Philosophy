    "main_text": "How Is Intrinsic Value to Be Computed?\n6. What Is Extrinsic Value?\n\nAt the beginning of this article, extrinsic value was said\nsimply\u2014too simply\u2014to be value that is not intrinsic.\nLater, once intrinsic value had been characterized as nonderivative\nvalue of a certain, perhaps moral kind, extrinsic value was said more\nparticularly to be derivative value of that same kind. That\nwhich is extrinsically good is good, not (insofar as its extrinsic\nvalue is concerned) for its own sake, but for the sake of something\nelse to which it is related in some way. For example, the goodness of\nhelping others in time of need is plausibly thought to be extrinsic\n(at least in part), being derivative (at least in part) from the\ngoodness of something else, such as these people\u2019s needs being\nsatisfied, or their experiencing pleasure, to which helping them is\nrelated in some causal way.\n\nTwo questions arise. The first is whether so-called extrinsic value is\nreally a type of value at all. There would seem to be a sense in which\nit is not, for it does not add to or detract from the value in the\nworld. Consider some long chain of derivation. Suppose that the\nextrinsic value of A can be traced to the intrinsic value of\nZ by way of B, C, D\u2026 Thus\nA is good (for example) because of B, which is good\nbecause of C, and so on, until we get to Y\u2019s\nbeing good because of Z; when it comes to Z,\nhowever, we have something that is good, not because of something\nelse, but \u201cbecause of itself,\u201d i.e., for its own sake. In\nthis sort of case, the values of A, B, \u2026,\nY are all parasitic on the value of Z. It is\nZ\u2019s value that contributes to the value there is in the\nworld; A, B, \u2026, Y contribute no\nvalue of their own. (As long as the value of Z is the only\nintrinsic value at stake, no change of value would be effected in or\nimparted to the world if a shorter route from A to Z\nwere discovered, one that bypassed some letters in the middle of the\nalphabet.)\n\nWhy talk of \u201cextrinsic value\u201d at all, then? The answer can\nonly be that we just do say that certain things are good, and others\nbad, not for their own sake but for the sake of something else to\nwhich they are related in some way. To say that these things are good\nand bad only in a derivative sense, that their value is merely\nparasitic on or reflective of the value of something else, is one\nthing; to deny that they are good or bad in any respectable sense is\nquite another. The former claim is accurate; hence the latter would\nappear unwarranted.\n\nIf we accept that talk of \u201cextrinsic value\u201d can be\nappropriate, however, a second question then arises: what sort of\nrelation must obtain between A and Z if A\nis to be said to be good \u201cbecause of\u201d Z? It is\nnot clear just what the answer to this question is. Philosophers have\ntended to focus on just one particular causal relation, the means-end\nrelation. This is the relation at issue in the example given earlier:\nhelping others is a means to their needs being satisfied, which is\nitself a means to their experiencing pleasure. The term most often\nused to refer to this type of extrinsic value is \u201cinstrumental\nvalue,\u201d although there is some dispute as to just how this term\nis to be employed. (Remember also, from Section 3 above, that on some\nviews \u201cinstrumental value\u201d may refer to a type of\nintrinsic, or final, value.) Suppose that A is a\nmeans to Z, and that Z is intrinsically good. Should\nwe therefore say that A is instrumentally good? What if\nA has another consequence, Y, and this consequence\nis intrinsically bad? What, especially, if the intrinsic badness of\nY is greater than the intrinsic goodness of Z? Some\nwould say that in such a case A is both instrumentally good\n(because of Z) and instrumentally bad (because of\nY). Others would say that it is correct to say that\nA is instrumentally good only if all of A\u2019s\ncausal consequences that have intrinsic value are, taken as a whole,\nintrinsically good. Still others would say that whether something is\ninstrumentally good depends not only on what it causes to happen but\nalso on what it prevents from happening (cf. Bradley 1998). For\nexample, if pain is intrinsically bad, and taking an aspirin puts a\nstop to your pain but causes nothing of any positive intrinsic value,\nsome would say that taking the aspirin is instrumentally good despite\nits having no intrinsically good consequences.\n\nMany philosophers write as if instrumental value is the only type of\nextrinsic value, but that is a mistake. Suppose, for instance, that\nthe results of a certain medical test indicate that the patient is in\ngood health, and suppose that this patient\u2019s having good health\nis intrinsically good. Then we may well want to say that the results\nare themselves (extrinsically) good. But notice that the results are\nof course not a means to good health; they are simply indicative of\nit. Or suppose that making your home available to a struggling artist\nwhile you spend a year abroad provides him with an opportunity he\nwould otherwise not have to create some masterpieces, and suppose that\neither the process or the product of this creation would be\nintrinsically good. Then we may well want to say that your making your\nhome available to him is (extrinsically) good because of the\nopportunity it provides him, even if he goes on to squander the\nopportunity and nothing good comes of it. Or suppose that\nsomeone\u2019s appreciating the beauty of the Mona Lisa\nwould be intrinsically good. Then we may well want to say that the\npainting itself has value in light of this fact, a kind of value that\nsome have called \u201cinherent value\u201d (Lewis 1946, p. 391; cf.\nFrankena 1973, p. 82). (\u201cInherent value\u201d may not\nbe the most suitable term to use here, since it may well suggest\nintrinsic value, whereas the sort of value at issue is\nsupposed to be a type of extrinsic value. The value\nattributed to the painting is one that it is said to have in virtue of\nits relation to something else that would supposedly be intrinsically\ngood if it occurred, namely, the appreciation of its beauty.) Many\nother instances could be given of cases in which we are inclined to\ncall something good in virtue of its relation to something else that\nis or would be intrinsically good, even though the relation in\nquestion is not a means-end relation.\n\nOne final point. It is sometimes said that there can be no extrinsic\nvalue without intrinsic value. This thesis admits of several\ninterpretations. First, it might mean that nothing can occur that is\nextrinsically good unless something else occurs that is intrinsically\ngood, and that nothing can occur that is extrinsically bad unless\nsomething else occurs that is intrinsically bad. Second, it might mean\nthat nothing can occur that is either extrinsically good or\nextrinsically bad unless something else occurs that is either\nintrinsically good or intrinsically bad. On both these\ninterpretations, the thesis is dubious. Suppose that no one ever\nappreciates the beauty of Leonardo\u2019s masterpiece, and that\nnothing else that is intrinsically either good or bad ever occurs;\nstill his painting may be said to be inherently good. Or suppose that\nthe aspirin prevents your pain from even starting, and hence inhibits\nthe occurrence of something intrinsically bad, but nothing else that\nis intrinsically either good or bad ever occurs; still your taking the\naspirin may be said to be instrumentally good. On a third\ninterpretation, however, the thesis might be true. That interpretation\nis this: nothing can occur that is either extrinsically good or\nextrinsically neutral or extrinsically bad unless something else\noccurs that is either intrinsically good or intrinsically neutral or\nintrinsically bad. This would be trivially true if, as some maintain,\nthe nonoccurrence of something intrinsically either good or bad\nentails the occurrence of something intrinsically neutral. But even if\nthe thesis should turn out to be false on this third interpretation,\ntoo, it would nonetheless seem to be true on a fourth interpretation,\naccording to which the concept of extrinsic value, in all its\nvarieties, is to be understood in terms of the concept of intrinsic\nvalue.\n",
