    "main_text": "Methodological Naturalism || Mathematical Anti-Revisionism\n1.1 Mathematical Anti-Revisionism\n\n\nNaturalism\u2014\u2018methodological\u2019 and \u2018in the\nphilosophy of mathematics\u2019 hereafter understood\u2014seems to\nhave anti-revisionary consequences for mathematics. The\nmathematician-philosopher L.E.J. Brouwer developed intuitionistic\nmathematics, which sought to overthrow and replace standard\n(\u2018classical\u2019) mathematics. Brouwer attempted to motivate\nintuitionistic mathematics philosophically with an intuition-based\naccount of mathematical truth. A more recent exponent of\nintuitionistic mathematics is Michael Dummett, who has developed\narguments from the philosophy of language, in particular the theory of\nmeaning, on its behalf. Yet scientific standards arguably condone\nclassical over intuitionistic mathematics: even if present-day science\ncould be entirely recast intuitionistically\u2014a\nbig if\u2014it would be less simple and more cumbersome than\nits current classically-based version. Mathematicians also tend to\nview intuitionistic mathematics as inferior to classical mathematics\nif construed as a rival to it. Hence neither Brouwer nor Dummett's\nintuitionism is apparently sanctioned by scientific or mathematical\nstandards, so naturalism rules them out of court.  Indeed, for\nmany of its adherents, that is precisely naturalism's point. Its\npoint, it is often thought, is to block fanciful attacks on\nestablished disciplines such as mathematics by disciplines with less secure\nmethodologies.\n",
