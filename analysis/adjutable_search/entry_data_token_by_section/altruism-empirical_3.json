Altruism in the Social Sciences\n\nIn recent decades there has been an enormous amount of discussion of\naltruism in psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology and\nprimatology. Much of the work in psychology, including all of the work\nrecounted in\n section 5,\n has adopted the \u201cstandard account\u201d of altruism. But some\npsychologists, and many researchers in other disciplines, have\nsomething very different in mind. In a useful review of recent\ndiscussions of altruism, Clavien and Chapuisat lament the fact\nthat \n\n\n[t]he notion of altruism has become so plastic that it is often hard\nto understand what is really meant by the authors using the term, and\neven harder to evaluate the degree to which results from one research\nfield\u2014e.g., experimental economics\u2014may facilitate the\nresolution of debates in another research field\u2014e.g.,\nevolutionary biology or philosophy. (2013: 134) \n\n\nOne of the notions that Clavien and Chapuisat find playing a role in\nevolutionary anthropology, evolutionary game theory and experimental\neconomics is what they call \u201cpreference altruism\u201d.\n\u201cAn action is altruistic\u201d, in this sense, \u201cif it\nresults from preferences for improving others\u2019 interests and\nwelfare at some cost to oneself\u201d (2013: 131). Though the\nagent\u2019s psychology is relevant, on this account of altruism,\nthere is no mention of the agent\u2019s ultimate desires.\nThus an action can be preference altruistic even if the agent\u2019s\npreference for improving someone else\u2019s welfare is an\ninstrumental preference engendered by the belief that improving the\nrecipient\u2019s welfare will contribute to the agent\u2019s own\npleasure or treasure. \n\nA second, quite different, concept of altruism invoked in these\ndisciplines is what Clavien and Chapuisat call \u201cbehavioral\naltruism\u201d. On this interpretation of altruism, an agent\u2019s\npsychology plays no role in determining whether her action is\naltruistic. \n\n\nA behavior is altruistic if it brings any kind of benefit to other\nindividuals at some cost for the agent, and if there is no foreseeable\nway for the agent to reap compensatory benefits from her behavior.\n(2013: 131)\n\n\nRamsey (2016) makes a plausible case that some eminent primatologists\nand psychologists (including de Waal (2008) and Warneken and Tomasello\n(2008)) invoke an even less demanding account of altruism, one that\nrequires that the recipient benefit but drops the requirement that\naltruistic behavior must involve some cost to the agent. Ramsey labels\nthis notion \u201chelping altruism\u201d.\n\nCombining accounts from philosophy, biology and the social sciences,\nPiccinini and Schulz (2019) offer a multidimensional taxonomy for\ndifferent accounts of altruism, and argue that the distinctions they\ndraw are essential for assessing the moral status of different kinds\nof altruism. \n\nIn reviewing the many different ways in which the term\n\u201caltruism\u201d has been used in the empirical and\nphilosophical literature, it is hard to resist allusions to the\nbiblical Tower of Babel. But for the remainder of this entry, these\ninterpretations of \u201caltruism\u201d will be left behind. From\nhere on, the focus will be on altruism as it is understood in the\nstandard account.\n",
