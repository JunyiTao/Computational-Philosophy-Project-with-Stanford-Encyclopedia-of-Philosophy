    "main_text": "Critiques of conservatism || Liberal critique\n3.2 Liberal critique\n\nWhile acknowledging his prescience about the Terror, liberals found\nBurke\u2019s fears concerning the French Revolution excessive.They\ntook a different view when confronted with the Bolshevik Revolution of\nOctober 1917, which Marxists regard as completing its\n\u201cbourgeois\u201d predecessor. Thus conservative historian\nRichard Pipes holds that the French Terror was a \u201cbrief\u2026\ncountercurrent\u201d, while the Red Terror was an \u201cessential\nelement of the regime\u201d (Pipes 1990: 789; see Trotsky quotation\nin discussion of revolutionary utopianism earlier in this entry).\n\nConservatives criticise \u201catomistic\u201d liberalism for\ntreating society as a mere collection of self-regarding individuals,\nheld together by rational norms and abstract laws rather than gaining\ntheir identity through an organic community; like communitarians,\nconservatives object to the primacy of abstract rights. Liberals reply\nthat \u201catomism\u201d refers simply to the conviction that\nalthough people live in society, individuals are, as Rawls writes,\n\u201cself-authenticating sources of valid claims\u201d, claims that\ndo not require validation by larger social structures. (Millian\nliberalism is less subject to the conservative charge of rationalism.)\nAs Gamble puts it,\n\n\nOakeshott rejects the universal claims of liberalism, because he is\ninterested only in claims grounded in English political\nexperience.\n\n\nThe great American charters of the late 18th century are,\nfor him,\n\n\nabridgements of British political experience, solidified into an\neternal document. (Gamble 2012: 161)\n\n\nBentham and\u2014on some views\u2014Burke seem to conceive only of\nlegal rights; but if one can make sense of moral obligation, one can\nmake sense of abstract rights.\n",
