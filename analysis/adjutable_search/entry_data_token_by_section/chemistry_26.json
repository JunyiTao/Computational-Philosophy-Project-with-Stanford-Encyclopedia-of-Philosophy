    "main_text": "Modeling and Chemical Explanation || Physical Modeling\n7.1 Physical Modeling\n\nChemistry\u2019s modeling tradition began with physical models of atoms and\nmolecules. In contemporary chemical education, much emphasis is placed\non the construction and manipulation of such models. Students in\norganic chemistry classes are often required to purchase plastic\nmolecular modeling kits, and it is not uncommon to see complex\nmolecular structures built from such kits in professional laboratory\nsettings.\n\nThe use of molecular models gained special prominence in the middle of\nthe 19th, helping chemists to understand the significance\nof molecular shape (Brock 2000). While such structures could be\nrepresented on paper, physical models gave an immediacy and an ease of\nvisualization that sketches alone did not provide. In the middle of\nthe twentieth century, the discovery of the double helical structure\nof DNA was aided by the manipulation of physical models (Watson\n1968).\n7.2. Mathematical Modeling\n\nWhile physical modeling has been important historically, and is still\na central part of chemical education and some investigations in\nstereochemistry, contemporary chemical models are almost always\nmathematical. Families of partially overlapping, partially\nincompatible models such as the valence bond, molecular\norbital, and semi-empirical models are used to explain\nand predict molecular structure and reactivity. Molecular\nmechanical models are used to explain some aspects of reaction\nkinetics and transport processes. And lattice models are used\nto explain thermodynamic properties such as phase. These and other\nmathematical models are ubiquitous in chemistry textbooks and\narticles, and chemists see them as central to chemical theory.\n\nChemists are very permissive about which kinds of mathematical\nstructures can serve as models. But while just about any kind of\nmathematical structure can serve as a chemical model, different types\nof systems lend themselves to particular kinds of mathematical\nstructures used in modeling. For example, the most common kinds of\nmathematical structures employed in quantum chemistry are state\nspaces, which typically correlate sub-molecular particle distances\nwith the total energy of chemical systems. Other parts of chemical\nmodeling are dynamic, hence they employ trajectory spaces, which can\nrepresent the course of a reaction over time. Still other kinds of\nmathematical structures such as graphs and groups can be employed to\nmodel molecular structure and symmetry.\n\nThe purpose of many exercises in chemical modeling is to learn about\nreal systems. In these cases, the model must bear certain\nrelationships to real-world systems. But these relationships needn\u2019t\nalways be of extremely high fidelity. For example, Linus Pauling\n(1939) and early proponents of the simple valence bond model believed\nthat this model captured the essential physical interactions that give\nrise to chemical bonding. This method is closely related to Lewis\u2019\nconception of bonding, treating molecules as composed of atomic cores\n(nuclei together with inner-shell electrons) and valence electrons\nwhich give rise to localized bonds. It stands in contrast to the\nmolecular orbital method, which doesn\u2019t localize the bonding electrons\nto any particular part of the molecule. Modern quantum chemists think\nof the valence bond model as a template for building models of greater\ncomplexity. Thus if a modern quantum chemist deploys the simple\nvalence bond model to study a real molecule, she does so with a much\nlower standard of fidelity than Pauling would have. Her use of the\nmodel is only intended to give a first approximation to the most\nimportant features of the system.\n7.3. Modeling and Explanation\n\nMuch of contemporary theoretical research in chemistry involves the\napplication of quantum mechanics to chemistry. While exact solutions\nto the quantum mechanical descriptions of chemical phenomena have not\nbeen achieved, advances in theoretical physics, applied mathematics,\nand computation have made it possible to calculate the chemical\nproperties of many molecules very accurately and with few\nidealizations. The approach of striving for ever more accurate\ncalculations with decreasing levels of idealization is endorsed by\nmany quantum chemists. For example, the development team of Gaussian,\none of the leading packages for doing quantum chemical calculations,\nexplicitly endorses this position. While they admit that there are\nmany considerations that enter into the choice of the degree of\napproximation or \u201clevel of theory\u201d for any calculation,\nthe goal is to de-idealize the models as much as possible. They argue\nthat quantum chemical calculations which are arbitrarily close to the\nexact solutions are the \u201climit to which all approximate methods\nstrive\u201d (Foresman & Frisch 1996).\n\nThis method of developing chemical theory relies on a systematic\nrefinement of theories, attempting to bring them closer to the truth.\nPhilosophers of science have called this process Galilean\nidealization, because as in Galileo\u2019s work, idealizations are\nintroduced for reasons of tractability and are removed as soon as\npossible (McMullin 1985; Weisberg 2007b). But not all chemists have\nshared this focus on ever more accurate calculations. Reflecting on\nwhy he didn\u2019t choose this path in his own career, theorist Roald\nHoffmann wrote:\n\nI took a different turn, moving from being a calculator \u2026 to\nbeing an explainer, the builder of simple molecular orbital models\n\u2026 [and] I feel that actually there is a deeper need than before\nfor [this] kind of work \u2026 analyzing a phenomenon within its own\ndiscipline and seeing its relationship to other concepts of equal\ncomplexity (1998).\n\n\nElsewhere in this article, Hoffmann admits that quantum chemistry is\nenormously successful in its predictive power, and continues to give\nus better approximations to the fundamental theory. Yet the attitude\nexpressed in this paragraph seems to be that simple, idealized models\nare needed for chemical theorizing. Thus, the central philosophical\nquestion arises: Given the availability of models that are closer to\nthe truth, why work with idealized ones?\n\nOne answer is given by Felix Carroll, a physical organic chemist:\n\nWhy then do not we just talk about high-level theoretical calculations\nand ignore the simple theory? We must choose the model that is\nsufficiently accurate for our computational purposes, yet still simple\nenough that we have some understanding of what the model describes.\nOtherwise, the model is a black box, and we have no understanding of\nwhat it does, perhaps even no idea whether the answers it produces are\nphysically reasonable (Carroll 1998).\n\n\nCarroll does not elaborate on these issues, but this passage contains\nthe central message: Simple models prevent our theories from having a\n\u201cblack-box\u201d character, meaning that they will not simply\nbe a recipe for calculating without giving any physical insight.\nCarroll claims that simple models are necessary in order to expose the\nmechanisms by which chemical phenomena come about. High-level\ntheoretical calculations are not capable of showing us these\nmechanistic relationships, even though they are based on the quantum\nmechanical principles that describe the fundamental physics of the\nsystem. Or, as Hoffmann puts the point: \u201c[I]f understanding is\nsought, simpler models, not necessarily the best in predicting all\nobservables in detail, will have value. Such models may highlight the\nimportant causes and channels\u201d (Hoffmann, Minkin, &\nCarpenter 1996).\n\nWhy should it be the case that simple models have less black-box\ncharacter than others? One explanation appeals to our cognitive\nlimitations. We can only hold a couple of steps of an argument in our\nmind at once. Modern, high-level calculations can take hours or days\nto compute using fast computers. Even if every step was made explicit\nby the computer, it would be impossible to hold the calculational\nsteps in mind and hence hard to understand the reason for the result,\neven if one was convinced that the answer was correct. Paul Humphreys\nhas called this the epistemic opacity of simulations\n(2004).\n\nThere is a second reason for employing simple, more highly idealized\nmodels in chemistry, which stems from the explanatory traditions of\nchemistry. In developing this point, Hoffmann argues that there are\ntwo modes of explanation that can be directed at chemical systems:\nhorizontal and vertical (Hoffmann 1997). Vertical\nexplanations are what philosophers of science call deductive\nnomological explanations. These explain a chemical phenomenon by\nderiving its occurrence from quantum mechanics. Calculations in\nquantum chemistry are often used to make predictions, but insofar as\nthey are taken to explain chemical phenomena, they follow this\npattern. By showing that a molecular structure is stable, the quantum\nchemist is reasoning that this structure was to be expected given the\nunderlying physics.\n\nIn contrast with vertical mode, the horizontal mode of explanation\nattempts to explain chemical phenomena with chemical concepts. For\nexample, all first year organic chemistry students learn about the\nrelative reaction rates of different substrates undergoing the\nSN2 reaction. An organic chemist might ask \u201cWhy does\nmethyl bromide undergo the SN2 reaction faster than methyl\nchloride?\u201d One answer is that \u201cthe leaving group\nBr\u2212 is a weaker base than Cl\u2212, and\nall things being equal, weaker bases are better leaving groups.\u201d\nThis explains a chemical reaction by appealing to a chemical property,\nin this case, the weakness of bases.\n\nHoffmann doesn\u2019t say much about the differing value of the horizontal\nand vertical explanations, but one important difference is that they\ngive us different kinds of explanatory information. Vertical\nexplanations demonstrate that chemical phenomena can be derived from\nquantum mechanics. They show that, given the (approximate) truth of\nquantum mechanics, the phenomenon observed had to have happened.\nHorizontal explanations are especially good for making\ncontrastive explanations, which allows the explanation of\ntrends. Consider again our example of the rate of an SN2\nreaction. By appealing to the weakness of Br\u2212 as a\nbase, the chemist invokes a chemical property, shared across other\nmolecules. This allows her to explain methyl bromide\u2019s reactivity as\ncompared to methyl chloride, and also methyl fluoride, methyl iodide,\netc. Insofar as chemists want to explain trends, they make contrastive\nexplanations using chemical concepts.\n\nReflecting on the nature of chemical theorizing, the eminent chemical\ntheorist Charles Coulson (1910\u20131974) makes a similar point. He\nwrote:\n\n[T]he role of quantum chemistry is to understand these concepts and\nshow what are the essential features in chemical behavior. [Chemists]\nare anxious to be told \u2026 why the H\u2013F bond is so strong,\nwhen the F\u2013F bond is so weak. They are content to let\nspectroscopists or physical chemists make the measurements; they\nexpect from the quantum mechanician that he will explain why the\ndifference exists. \u2026 So the explanation must not be that the\ncomputer shows that [the bonds are of different length], since this is\nnot an explanation at all, but merely a confirmation of experiment\n(Coulson 1960, p. 173).\n\n\nAlthough Coulson, Carroll, and Hoffmann defend the use of simple,\nidealized models to generate horizontal explanations, it is not clear\nthat quantum calculations can never generate contrastive explanations.\nAlthough single vertical explanations are not contrastive, a theorist\ncan conduct multiple calculations and in so doing, generate the\ninformation needed to make contrastive explanations. Many of the best\nexamples of quantum chemistry have this character: a series of closely\nrelated calculations, attempting to get at chemically relevant\ntrends.\n",
