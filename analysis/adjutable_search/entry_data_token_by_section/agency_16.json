    "main_text": "Empirical challenges and the role of consciousness || The sense of agency\n4.5 The sense of agency\nThere has been some debate concerning the kind of knowledge we have\nof our own actions. Most prominently, Anscombe (1957) argued that the\nknowledge of our actions is direct, in the sense that it is not based\non observation or inference (see the entry on\naction). \nThis section provides an overview of the closely related debate on the\nso called \u201csense of agency\u201d. It seems that when we act, we\nhave a sense of doing something: a sense of control and of being the\nagent or owner of the action. The debate about this has been driven\nlargely by empirical findings from psychology and cognitive science,\nand it has become common to distinguish between the following three\nmain positions.\n\nThe first is largely due to Wegner\u2019s work on the \u201cmodel of\napparent mental causation\u201d (Wegner and Wheatley 1999; Wegner\n2002). According to this view, the sense of agency (or the\n\u201cexperience of conscious will\u201d, as Wegner called it)\narises when we interpret a conscious intention to perform a\ncertain action as its cause. It says, in particular, that an agent\ninterprets an intention as the cause of an action when the following\nconditions obtain: the intention proximately precedes the action, the\naction is consistent with the intention, and the agent is not aware of\nany factors that could provide an alternative\nexplanation. Wegner\u2019s argument for the model of apparent mental\ncausation is based on various experiments, studies, and observations\nconcerning illusions of control and failures in the ascription of\nagency. This work initiated the empirical study of the sense of\nagency, but Wegner\u2019s model is now widely rejected. Philosophers\nhave criticized the view for various conceptual ambiguities and flaws\nin the interpretation and use of the evidence (Nahmias 2002; Bayne\n2006; Dennett 2008; and Mele 2009a, for instance). Moreover, there is\nnow plenty of empirical evidence to suggest that the sense of agency\nis not merely a matter of self-interpretation (Haggard 2005; Bayne and\nPacherie 2007; Gallagher 2007; and Synofzik et al. 2008).\n\nThe second account of the sense of agency is based on a\nfeedback-comparator model of motor control. According to this model,\nthe motor control system uses copies of motor commands in order to\ngenerate predictions of the ensuing bodily movements. Those\npredictions (so called \u201cforward models\u201d) are then used for\ncomparisons between the predicted and the intended trajectories of\nmovements, and for comparisons between the predicted and actual\ntrajectories (based on information from sensory feedback). The model\nholds that a sub-personal system of motor control uses those\npredictions and comparisons in order to adjust and fine-tune the\nexecution of bodily movements (Wolpert and Kawato 1998; Frith et\nal. 2000; Haggard 2005). It has been suggested that this system may\nalso play a crucial role in the generation of the sense of agency. On\nthis view, positive matches in the comparator system generate a sense\nof agency, whereas mismatches generate error signals that disrupt the\nsense of agency. This model can explain a wide range of phenomena\nconcerning the sense and control of agency (Frith et al. 2000;\nBlakemore et al. 2002). More recently it has been argued, however,\nthat this comparator model provides at best a partial explanation of\nthe sense of agency (Haggard 2005; Bayne and Pacherie 2007; Gallagher\n2007; Synofzik et al. 2008).\n\nThe third account of the sense of agency is a hybrid of the first\ntwo. Proponents of this approach usually distinguish between a basic\nsense of agency and post-act judgments concerning one\u2019s agency.\nThe basic sense of agency is construed as an online and\nphenomenologically rather thin experience that accompanies the\nperformance of actions, and that does not necessarily require the\npresence of a conscious intention. Judgments about one\u2019s agency,\nin contrast, are offline and usually post-act, and they are, thereby,\nsubject to various biases that may distort the interpretation of\none\u2019s own agency. The feedback-comparator model is well suited\nto explain the basic sense of agency, whereas a self-interpretation\ntheory, akin to Wegner\u2019s, can explain why judgments about\none\u2019s own agency tend to be distorted or illusory under certain\nconditions (Bayne and Pacherie 2007; Gallagher 2007; Synofzik et\nal. 2008).\n\nPacherie (2008) develops the feedback-comparator model into an account\nof the phenomenology of agency that postulates three integrated\nfeedback loops at three different levels of intention: the level of\ndistal (or future-directed) intention, proximal (or present-directed)\nintention, and motor intention. These are levels of action\nspecification in which progressively more detailed representations of\nthe action are generated, at the later stages in response to\nperceptual and proprioceptive feedback. Pacherie\u2019s main thesis\nis that the component representations of the stages in the process of\naction specification are strongly interconnected with the components\nand contents of the phenomenology of agency. At the level of proximal\nintentions, for instance, the model explains how the conceptual\ninformation that is inherited from the distal intention is integrated\nwith perceptual input and situational constraints. Concerning the\nsense of agency, the model distinguishes between the awareness of what\n(the goal), awareness of how (the means), the sense of intentionality,\nthe sense of initiation, the sense of situational control, and the\nsense of motor control. Shepherd (2017) argues that the components in\nthe phenomenology of agency are so richly integrated that they can be\nregarded as fused in the total experience.\n",
