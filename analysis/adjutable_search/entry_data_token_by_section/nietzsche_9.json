    "main_text": "Key Doctrines || Perspectivism\n6.2 Perspectivism\n\nMuch of Nietzsche\u2019s reaction to the philosophy of his\npredecessors is mediated through his interest in the notion of\nperspective. He thought that past philosophers had largely ignored the\ninfluence of their own perspectives on their work, and had therefore\nfailed to control those perspectival effects (BGE 6; see\nBGE I more generally). Commentators have been both fascinated\nand perplexed by what has come to be called Nietzsche\u2019s\n\u201cperspectivism\u201d, and it has been a major concern in a\nnumber of large-scale Nietzsche commentaries (see, e.g., Danto 1965;\nKaulbach 1980, 1990; Schacht 1983; Abel 1984; Nehamas 1985; Clark\n1990; Poellner 1995; Richardson 1996; Benne 2005). There has been as\nmuch contestation over exactly what doctrine or group of commitments\nbelong under that heading as about their philosophical merits, but a\nfew points are relatively uncontroversial and can provide a useful way\ninto this strand of Nietzsche\u2019s thinking.\n\nNietzsche\u2019s appeals to the notion of perspective (or,\nequivalently in his usage, to an \u201coptics\u201d of knowledge)\nhave a positive, as well as a critical side. Nietzsche frequently\ncriticizes \u201cdogmatic\u201d philosophers for ignoring the\nperspectival limitations on their theorizing, but as we saw, he\nsimultaneously holds that the operation of perspective makes a\npositive contribution to our cognitive endeavors. Speaking of (what he\ntakes to be) the perversely counterintuitive doctrines of some past\nphilosophers, he writes,\n\n\nParticularly as knowers, let us not be ungrateful toward such resolute\nreversals of the familiar perspectives and valuations with which the\nspirit has raged against itself all too long\u2026 : to see\ndifferently in this way for once, to want to see differently,\nis no small discipline and preparation of the intellect for its future\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d\u2014the latter understood not as\n\u201cdisinterested contemplation\u201d (which is a non-concept and\nabsurdity), but rather as the capacity to have one\u2019s Pro and\nContra in one\u2019s power, and to shift them in and out, so\nthat one knows how to make precisely the difference in\nperspectives and affective interpretations useful for knowledge.\n(GM III, 12)\n\n\nThis famous passage bluntly rejects the idea, dominant in philosophy\nat least since Plato, that knowledge essentially involves a form of\nobjectivity that penetrates behind all subjective appearances to\nreveal the way things really are, independently of any point of view\nwhatsoever. Instead, the proposal is to approach\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d (in a revised conception) asymptotically, by\nexploiting the difference between one perspective and another, using\neach to overcome the limitations of others, without assuming that\nanything like a \u201cview from nowhere\u201d is so much as\npossible. There is of course an implicit criticism of the traditional\npicture of a-perspectival objectivity here, but there is equally a\npositive set of recommendations about how to pursue knowledge as a\nfinite, limited cognitive agent.\n\nIn working out his perspective optics of cognition, Nietzsche built on\ncontemporary developments in the theory of\ncognition\u2014particularly the work of non-orthodox neo-Kantians\nlike Friedrich Lange and positivists like Ernst Mach, who proposed\nnaturalized, psychologically-based versions of the broad type of\ntheory of cognition initially developed by Kant and Schopenhauer (see\nClark 1990; Kaulbach 1980, 1990; Anderson 1998, 2002, 2005; Green\n2002; Hill 2003; Hussain 2004). The Kantian thought was that certain\nvery basic structural features of the world we know (space, time,\ncausal relations, etc.) were artifacts of our subjective cognitive\nfaculties rather than properties or relations of things in themselves;\nbut where Kant and Schopenhauer had treated these structures as\nnecessary, a priori conditions of any possible experience whatsoever,\nthe more naturalistically oriented figures who influenced Nietzsche\nsought to trace them to sources in human empirical psychology, which\nwould of course be contingent. The potential of these ineliminable\nsubject-side influences to vary suggests the idea of treating\nthem as a kind of perspective, which Nietzsche found\ndeveloped in an idealist version by Gustav Teichm\u00fcller (1882).\nLeaving Teichm\u00fcller\u2019s idealism to one side, Nietzsche\ndevelops the idea by tying cognitively important perspectives back to\nhis own psychology. In particular, the Genealogy passage\nemphasizes that for him, perspectives are always rooted in\naffects and their associated patterns of valuation. For that\nreason, Nietzsche holds that \u201cevery great philosophy so\nfar\u201d has been \u201cthe personal confession of its author and a\nkind of involuntary and unconscious memoir\u201d (BGE 6).\nThus, theoretical claims not only need to be analyzed from the point\nof view of truth, but can also be diagnosed as symptoms and\nthereby traced back to the complex configurations of drive and affect\nfrom the point of view of which they make sense. Nietzsche\u2019s\nperspectivism thus connects to his \u201cgenealogical\u201d program\nof criticizing philosophical theories by exposing the psychological\nneeds they satisfy; perspectivism serves both to motivate the program,\nand to provide it with methodological guidance.\n\nBut Nietzsche\u2019s perspectivism and his arguments for it go beyond\nepistemology, or the \u201ctheory of cognition\u201d\n(Erkenntnistheorie), as it was practiced in the broadly\nKantian milieu of his contemporary philosophy. (One should say, they\n\u201cgo beyond\u201d the theory of cognition at least;\nGemes (2009c, 2013) argues that epistemological interpretations of\nperspectivism are altogether mistaken, and that it should be taken\ninstead as fundamentally a doctrine within moral psychology, about the\ndrives and affects.) Nietzsche makes perspectivist claims not only\nconcerning the side of the cognitive subject, but also about the side\nof the truth, or reality, we aim to know. His views on this topic have\nbeen highly controversial, with some scholars emphasizing\nNietzsche\u2019s apparent denials of truth (either skeptical denials\nthat any truth is ever knowable, or more radical claims that the very\nidea of truth is somehow incoherent), and others highlighting his own\nfrequent and routine claims for the truth of his own views, as well as\nthe valorization of truthfulness and honesty we saw above (3.B.iv.). A\nnumber of different strategies have been proposed for reconciling the\ntensions between these different strands of text, including the\nsupposition that at least some of Nietzsche\u2019s own claims must\nfall outside the scope of his denials of truth (Hales and Welshon\n2000), the idea that Nietzsche distinguished different senses of\n\u201ctruth\u201d (Schacht 1983; Anderson 1998, 2005), and the\ndevelopmental proposal that Nietzsche eventually gave up on his\ndenials of truth late in his career (Clark 1990, 1998). (See recent\nexchanges on this topic between Clark (2018) and Nehamas (2015, 2017,\n2018).) In addition to work focused on Nietzsche\u2019s understanding\nof truth per se, a good deal of scholarly effort has explored\nthe way Nietzsche attempts to build his perspectivism down into the\nontology of the world by understanding reality itself as a system of\never-shifting force-centers which themselves constitute a variety of\npoints of view on the whole (notable contributions include Deleuze\n[1962] 1983; Abel 1984; Poellner 1995; Richardson 1996;\nM\u00fcller-Lauter 1999a; Hales and Welshon 2000; Gemes 2013). These\nefforts argue for strong connections between perspectivism and the\nwill to power doctrine\n (section 6.1).\n",
