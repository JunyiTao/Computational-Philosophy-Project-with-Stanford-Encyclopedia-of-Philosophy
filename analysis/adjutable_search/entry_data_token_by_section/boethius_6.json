    "main_text": "Interpreting the Consolation\n8. Boethius\u2019s Influence and Importance\n\nThe influence of each area of Boethius\u2019s philosophical writing\nwas vast in the Middle Ages. Along with Augustine and Aristotle, he is\nthe fundamental philosophical and theological author in the\nLatin tradition.\n\nIn logic, Boethius\u2019s translations of Aristotle and Porphyry\n(except for that of the Posterior Analytics, which was lost)\nremained standard throughout the Middle Ages. His\ncommentaries\u2014especially that on the Categories, the\nsecond commentary on the Isagoge and the second, more\nadvanced commentary on On Interpretation\u2014were the main\ninstruments by which logicians from the ninth to the twelfth centuries\ncame to understand the Aristotelian texts he had translated, and to\ngrapple with their problems and the wider range of related\nphilosophical issues raised by the late ancient tradition. Even\ntwelfth-century philosophers as independently-minded as Abelard and\nGilbert of Poitiers were deeply indebted to these commentaries. The\nlogical text-books were equally important. Before the Prior\nAnalytics became generally available in the later twelfth\ncentury, students learned syllogistic from Boethius\u2019s monographs\non it. The theory of topical argument, acquired especially from On\nTopical Differentiae, provided a framework for twelfth-century\nphilosophers in propounding and analysing arguments, and from the\ncombination of studying topical argument and the theory of\nhypothetical syllogisms as Boethius presented it, Abelard was led\ntowards his rediscovery of propositional logic (cf. Martin (1987)).\nFrom the thirteenth century, onwards, however, both Boethius\u2019s\ncommentaries and his treatises became less influential. On Topical\nDifferentiae, and On Division, continued to be studied,\nbut not the treatises on categorical and hypothetical syllogisms.\nUsers of the commentaries were infrequent, but they include Thomas\nAquinas.\n\nThe theological treatises were probably already known by the pupils of\nAlcuin at the court of Charlemagne around 800, and a tradition of\nglosses to the text probably goes back to the School of Auxerre in the\nlater ninth century. The opuscula sacra provided a model for\nearly medieval thinkers who wanted to use their logical training in\nthinking about Christian doctrine. Anselm was certainly aware of them,\nthough he looked more closely to Augustine; Abelard\u2019s first\ntheological work, the Theologia Summi Boni, despite its\noriginality, is clearly inspired by Boethius\u2019s first treatise\n(on the Trinity). In the 1140s, Gilbert of Poitiers expounded his\nmetaphysics and his view of theology in a detailed exegesis of the\nopuscula sacra, which came to be the standard commentary,\nalthough the treatises were also commented on by other, more\nPlatonically-minded twelfth-century scholars. Although the\nopuscula sacra were not formally a part of the theology\ncurriculum in most later medieval universities, they continued to be\nstudied, and Aquinas wrote commentaries on Treatises I and III.\n\nThough the influence of these other works was great, the popularity\nand importance of the Consolation far exceeded it. The text\nalready echoes in what must be one of the earliest pieces of genuinely\nmedieval Latin philosophy, the little treatise \u2018On True\nPhilosophy\u2019 with which Alcuin prefaced his De\ngrammatica, and it remained a favourite through the later Middle\nAges and into the Renaissance. Not until the time of Gibbon had it\nbeen reduced to an object of the historian\u2019s condescending\nadmiration. One measure of the extent and character of its readership\nis the translations, not merely into almost every medieval vernacular,\nbut also into Greek and even Hebrew. Among the translators were two of\nthe greatest vernacular writers of the whole epoch: Jean de Meun, who\nput the Consolation into Old French in the later thirteenth\ncentury, and Chaucer, who translated it into Middle English about a\ncentury later. As their involvement suggests, Boethius\u2019s\ndialogue was a text which popularized philosophy outside the\nuniversities, and its literary features, as well as its arguments,\ninspired imitations and creative adaptations, from Alain of\nLille\u2019s De planctu Naturae (\u2018Nature\u2019s\nLament\u2019) to, more distantly, Dante\u2019s Convivio and\neven Chaucer\u2019s Troilus and Criseyde. Philosophers and\ntheologians, too, used the work; it was part of the school syllabus\nfrom the ninth to the twelfth centuries, and although\nAristotle\u2019s treatises left no room for it in the university\ncurriculum, it continued to be studied by students and teachers there.\nFor example, Aquinas\u2019s account of the highest good in his\nSumma Theologiae IaIIe builds on the Consolation,\nand the definition of eternity given by Philosophy in Book V became\nthe starting-point for almost every later medieval discussion of God\nand time. Moreover, the Consolation continued to be important\nin philosophical discussions right up to the end of the seventeenth\ncentury (cf. Belli 2011).\n\nThe Consolation had many medieval commentaries\u2014mostly\non the whole text, although some just examined Book III, m. 9. In the\ntenth and eleventh centuries, the commentary written by Remigius of\nAuxerre was the most widely read (and often adapted). William of\nConches\u2019s commentary, written in the 1120s, became standard in\nthe twelfth and thirteenth centuries and the commentary by the English\nDominican, Nicholas Trivet, from the beginning of the fourteenth\ncentury, was the most popular in the late Middle Ages. One of the\ncentral problems which faced any commentator was the relation of the\ntext to Christian teaching. Remigius and, in a subtler way, William\nboth took Boethius, whom they knew to be a Christian, to be putting\nforward Christian doctrine without seeming to do so; Trivet\u2019s\napproach is less syncretistic, although he finds nothing unacceptable\nfor Christians in the Consolation. \n\nThe preceding paragraphs in this section might seem to indicate that\nthere is no doubt about Boethius\u2019s importance as a philosopher.\nYet the very size of his medieval influence has led to an attitude,\nwidespread among historians of philosophy (see especially Courcelle\n(1967)), which makes Boethius almost disappear as a figure in his own\nright. He is seen, rather, as a conduit through which Greek\nphilosophical ideas were transmitted to the Latin tradition. Of\ncourse, one aspect of Boethius\u2019s influence is indeed that he\nmade available ideas and arguments deriving from Plato, Aristotle,\nAlexander of Aphrodisias, Porphyry and Iamblichus. But he was also an\nindividual thinker, with pronounced tastes and views, no less (if no\nmore) original than his Greek contemporaries; and also, in the\nConsolation, one of the rare philosophers whose thought, like\nPlato\u2019s, cannot be neatly separated from the complex literary\nform in which it is expressed.\n",
