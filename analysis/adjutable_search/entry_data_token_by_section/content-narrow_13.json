    "main_text": "Conceptions of Narrow Content || Diagonal Propositions\n4.4 Diagonal Propositions\n\nThe complaint that on the mapping conception, narrow contents are not\ntruth conditional, and hence perhaps should not be called\n\u201ccontents\u201d at all, can be met by an interesting twist on\nthe mapping conception. Instead of considering a function from\ncontexts of acquisition to broad contents in its full generality, we\ncan focus our attention on a narrower function, the \u201cdiagonal\nproposition\u201d determined by a Fodorian narrow content. The idea,\nand the term \u201cdiagonal proposition,\u201d were originally\nintroduced by Robert Stalnaker in a different context (Stalnaker 1999,\nespecially papers 4, 6, and 7), but it turns out to be useful here. It\nis not clear that anyone has actually proposed this idea as an account\nof narrow content, but Stalnaker has suggested it as an interpretation\nof Loar\u2019s view (Stalnaker 1990, discussing Loar 1988), and the\nview of Chalmers (1996) has sometimes been understood in this way\n(e.g. by Block and Stalnaker 1999).\n\nRecall that on the mapping conception, a narrow content is a function\nfrom environments or contexts of acquisition to broad contents. Broad\ncontents in turn are thought of as determining truth conditions; that\nis, a broad content will be true in some situations and false in\nothers. How should we think of the environments or contexts that\ndetermine broad content, and the situations in which broad contents\nare true or false? One reasonably natural suggestion is the following.\nOscar and Twin Oscar both actually exist (in Putnam\u2019s fantasy),\nbut they have different environments, different contexts of\nacquisition. We can think of their contexts as including all\nthe objective or nonperspectival facts about the actual world,\nplus a bit more, namely information about their locations in\nthat world. This may be more information than we need, but it gives us\na simple way to characterize contexts, and it is guaranteed to include\neverything relevant to the contribution of the natural and social\nenvironment to the contents of their beliefs. And of course, in\naddition to the actual contexts of Oscar and Twin Oscar, we can\nconsider other possible contexts, other environments that they might\nhave inhabited. In general, we can say that a context of an individual\nat a time is a centered world, a possible world that we\nregard as centered on the relevant individual and time.\n\nWith this background, we can consider a way to visualize the mapping\nconception. We will consider how the account applies to an example\nsimilar to that of Oscar and Twin Oscar. To keep things simple, we\nwill change the example slightly. Instead of regarding Earth and Twin\nEarth as two different planets both of which exist in the actual\nworld, we will consider them as different ways things could have\nturned out to be on our actual planet. In the actual world, the watery\nstuff on Earth is H2O; in a possible counterfactual world,\nit is XYZ instead. We will envision Oscar looking at a beaker full of\na colorless, odorless liquid and thinking a thought that he would\nexpress by saying \u201cthat beaker contains water.\u201d\n\nNow, we consider three possible environments or contexts, which we are\nthinking of as centered worlds. These are:\n\ncontext 1: Oscar\u2019s \u2018water\u2019-thoughts have been\nacquired in an environment in which the colorless, odorless liquid\nthat falls from the sky and fills the lakes is XYZ. For short, let us\nsay that Oscar\u2019s \u2018water\u2019-thoughts are\nanchored in XYZ. Moreover, the substance in the beaker in\nfront of him is in fact XYZ.\ncontext 2: Oscar\u2019s \u2018water\u2019-thoughts are anchored\nin H2O. Moreover, the substance in the beaker in front of\nhim is in fact H2O.\ncontext 3: As in context 2, Oscar\u2019s\n\u2018water\u2019-thoughts are anchored in H2O. However,\nin context 3, the substance in the beaker is neither H2O\nnor XYZ, but sulfuric acid, H2SO4.\n\n\nIn context 2 and context 3, Oscar\u2019s \u2018water\u2019-thoughts\nare about water, i.e. H2O, while in context 1 they are\nabout XYZ. Whether Oscar\u2019s thought about the substance in the\nbeaker is true or not depends on two things: what his thought means,\ni.e. its broad content, and a certain fact about the world, namely\nwhat substance is in the beaker. Since a context includes all the\nobjective facts about a world plus additional information about the\n\u201ccenter\u201d of the world, each context determines a unique\npossible world. For example, if we take context 1 and subtract the\ninformation about the time and individual on which the context is\ncentered, we obtain a possible world we could call w(context 1).\n\nWe can summarize the situation in the following table:\n\n\n\n\nw(context 1)\n\nsubstance:\n\nXYZ\nw(context 2)\n\nsubstance:\n\nH2O\nw(context 3)\n\nsubstance:\n\nH2SO4 \n\n1\n anchor: XYZ;\n\nsubstance: XYZ\nT\nF\nF \n\n2\n anchor: H20;\n\nsubstance: H2O\nF\nT\nF \n\n3\n anchor: H2O;\n\nsubstance: H2SO4\nF\nT\nF \n\n\nThe items in the left-hand column of our table are contexts. The\nhorizontal row to the right of each context represents the truth\nconditions or broad content Oscar\u2019s thought has if it originated\nin the indicated context. For instance, in context 1, Oscar\u2019s\nthought has the broad content that there is XYZ in the beaker. This\nthought is true in the world of context 1, false in the world of\ncontext 2 (since the beaker contains H2O in that world),\nand false in the world of context 3. A suitably extended version of\nour table, then, could be regarded as visually representing the narrow\ncontent of Oscar\u2019s thought about the substance in the beaker, on\nthe mapping conception of narrow content, since it would illustrate,\nfor each context, the broad content associated with Oscar\u2019s\nthought by that context.\n\nNow we can say what the \u201cdiagonal proposition\u201d is. It is\nsimply the proposition represented by the diagonal from the upper left\nto the lower right of the above table. This represents the truth value\nOscar\u2019s belief has, for any context, in the world of that\ncontext. The truth conditions this gives us are different from\nany of the three broad contents Oscar\u2019s belief might have\ndepending on his context. But arguably they also give a better account\nof his narrow content than any of the horizontal propositions does.\nUnaware as he is of the chemical structure of water, Oscar has no\ndirect access to which possible context is his actual context, and\nthus in a sense does not know what broad content his thoughts have. He\nalso does not know for certain what liquid the beaker contains. What\nhe does know is that if his\n\u2018water\u2019-thoughts are anchored in XYZ and the substance in\nthe glass is also XYZ, then his belief is true; and if his\n\u2018water\u2019-thoughts are anchored in H2O and the\nsubstance in the glass is also H2O, then his belief is\ntrue; and if his \u2018water\u2019-thoughts are anchored in\nH2O and the substance in the glass is\nH2SO4, then his belief is false; and so on. In\nshort, although his internal state does not suffice to determine any\nof the horizontal propositions, it does suffice to determine the\ndiagonal proposition, which therefore seems to do a better job of\ncapturing Oscar\u2019s state of mind than the horizontal propositions\ndo.\n\nThe diagonal proposition view seems to avoid many of the difficulties\nof other approaches to narrow content. In particular, it does provide\ntruth conditions, and hence seems clearly to be a kind of content.\n(However, Kriegel (2008) points out that, while two-dimensional\naccounts like this one and the epistemic account to be discussed next\ncan provide truth conditions for \u201cthe mental analog of a\nsentence\u201d and thus explain how it \u201cputs us in cognitive\ncontact with a state of affairs that constitutes its potential truth\nmaker\u201d (305), it is not so clear how the account can associate\nthe mental analogs of subsentential expressions with worldly things\nand properties. Kriegel offers an account according to which concepts,\nthe mental analogs of predicate terms, denote response-dependent\nproperties.)\n\nThe main difficulties for the diagonal proposition account concern (1)\nhow to apply it in order to determine the narrow content of a given\nmental state, and (2) the fact that it gives a way of defining the\ntruth conditions of a mental state only in centered worlds in which\nthe state actually exists. In the example above, for instance, Oscar\nis presumed to be in the same mental state in each context, although\ndifferences in how he came to be in that state affect its content. But\nthis raises the problem of what we need to \u201chold constant\u201d\nin considering various counterfactual contexts in order to be\nconsidering a context in which Oscar is in the relevant state. These\nissues are considered briefly in section 5.1.\n",
