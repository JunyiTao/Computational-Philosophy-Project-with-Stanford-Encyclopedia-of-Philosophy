    "main_text": "Later Developments || An Oddity\n5.3 An Oddity\n\n\nThere is one odd view that occurs at least twice, which may have as a\nconsequence that there are no empty terms. In the thirteenth century,\nLambert of Lagny (sometimes identified as Lambert of Auxerre) proposed\nthat a term such as \u2018chimera\u2019 which stands for no existing\nthing must \u201crevert to nonexistent things.\u201d So if we\nsuppose that no roses exist, then the term \u2018rose\u2019 stands\nfor nonexistent\n things.[19] \n A related view also occurs much later;\nAshworth reports that Menghus Blanchellus Faventinus held that\nnegative terms such as \u2018nonman\u2019 are true of non-beings,\nand he concluded from this that \u2018A nonman is a chimera\u2019 is\ntrue (apparently assuming that \u2018chimera\u2019 is also true of\nnonbeings).[20]\nHowever, neither of these views seems to have been clearly developed,\nand neither was widely\n adopted.[21]\n Nor is it clear that either of them is\nsupposed to have the consequence that there are no empty terms.\n",
