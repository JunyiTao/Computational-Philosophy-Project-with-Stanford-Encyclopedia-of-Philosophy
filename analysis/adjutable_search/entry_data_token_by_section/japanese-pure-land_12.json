Philosophical Issues in Japanese Pure Land Buddhist Thought\n\nThe question of the relationship between a person\u2019s act of\nnembutsu and Amida Buddha\u2019s Other Power\u2014or between trust\nin Amida\u2019s vow, which infuses each human act of nembutsu with\nOther Power, and the practice of the nembutsu, which has been devised\nand made efficacious for beings by the Buddha\u2014raises profound\nquestions concerning the sources and significance of human\nsubjectivity and agency. Above all, the emergence of such issues\nwithin the context of a thoroughgoing application of the general\nMahayana critique of self-attachment in religious praxis gave rise to\nthe most innovative philosophical reflection in the Japanese Pure Land\ntradition. Thus, it is among disciples of H\u014dnen who tended toward\nthe pole of emphasis on trust or on the adequacy of a single utterance\nan engagement with issues that have a distinct resonance with\nintellectual concerns today. This is because such disciples found it\nnecessary to take up questions of one\u2019s self-awareness in the\nrelationship between being and Buddha in the immediate present and to\ndelineate a groundwork for deconstructing commonsense subject-object\ndualisms applied to this relationship without recourse to abstract\nconceptions of mystical transcendence.\n\nAt the same time, all of H\u014dnen\u2019s disciples found it\nnecessary to formulate responses to the relentless criticisms of the\ntraditional schools, which led periodically to state suppression of\nthe nembutsu teaching, and some resorted to adjustment of various\npositions H\u014dnen\u2019s logic led him to. For example, one of the\nleading disciples, Sh\u014dk\u014d (1162\u20131238), founder of the\ndominant Chinzei branch of the J\u014ddo school, abandoned\nH\u014dnen\u2019s view that only the nembutsu could lead to birth in\nthe Pure Land and recognized the efficacy of the traditional\npractices. Others, however, such as Shinran, Sh\u014dk\u016b\n(1177\u20131247), and Ippen (1239\u20131289), pursued the\ndevelopment of H\u014dnen\u2019s radical teaching, each in his own\ndistinctive way, and it is among such figures that we find the more\nphilosophical strains of thinking.\n\nLet us turn here to several basic issues in Pure Land Buddhist thought\nthat (1) emerged from problems of practical engagement but were given\ncharacteristic treatment specifically in Japan, and (2) may be\nconsidered to have received philosophical attention in the sense that,\nregarding them, Japanese Pure Land Buddhists were forced, by\nintra-sectarian debate, to seek a degree of intellectual\nself-understanding distinct both from scholastic Buddhist discourse\nand from the kind of realization achieved through religious\nengagement.\n\nIn addition, for convenience, I will discuss these issues under the\nheadings of metaphysics, anthropology, hermeneutics, and ethics. It\nshould be borne in mind, however, that these Western categories, while\nhelpful in establishing a starting point and pursuing the comparative\nconcerns implied in a \u201cphilosophical\u201d approach to Buddhist\nthought, suggest conceptual contours that must in fact be continually\nbreached in seeking to accommodate the fundamentally pragmatic\norientation of the Japanese Pure Land tradition and its roots in\nMahayana Buddhist thought. In fact, the four headings are best\nunderstood as slightly differing perspectives on essentially the same\ncentral problem: the apprehension of what is true and real from within\na stance of radical conditionedness. What enables such apprehension?\nWhat is its significance for human existence? How does it come about?\nAnd what implications does it hold for the conduct of life?\n",
