    "main_text": "Problems of Interpretation\n11. Conclusion\n\n\nBurke\u2019s thought is philosophical in at least two senses. One is that\nit is constituted in part by thinking in terms of philosophical\nconceptions, especially complex ideas, particularly those of relation,\nas well as involving significant positions in philosophical psychology\nand the philosophy of language. The other sense is that it develops an\naccount of the American, British and European past which is\nphilosophical history, as the eighteenth-century understood the\nterm. These senses, once put together, inform a style of practical\nthinking about politics which emphasizes the importance of synthetic\nas well as analytical thinking for practice, and suggests that a\nprogressive practice requires not only the yields of past effort but\nalso the intelligent application of mind to their further development\nif progress, rather than regress, is to result. Burke is perhaps the\nleast studied of political classics, but he is certainly amongst the\nsmall number with whom anyone who aspires to have an adequate\npolitical education must engage.\n",
