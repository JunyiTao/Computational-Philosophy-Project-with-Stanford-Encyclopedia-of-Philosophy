    "main_text": "Other Concerns || Does Modal Fictionalism Deliver Possible Worlds Semantics?\n4.6 Three More Concerns\n\nModal fictionalism has attracted a range of other objections and\nconcerns. Some of these can be generalised to other fictionalist\nprojects; some generalise to other approaches to possible worlds; and\nsome seem to rely on specific features of modal fictionalist\nproposals. Rather than trying to describe each controversy in detail,\nI will briefly outline three with some references for those who wish\nto track down the relevant\n literature.[8]\n\nThe Threat from Abstractionism: Fictionalists seem to\nneed fictions, in the sense of stories or story-like entities. Some\nrealists about possible worlds treat possible worlds themselves as\nrepresentational entities of the same general sort that fictions seem\nto be: these theorists are \u201cabstractionists\u201d in the\nterminology of van Inwagen 1986, or \u201cersatzers\u201d in the\nterminology of Lewis 1986. Abstractionists may take worlds to be\nconstructions out of sentences, or perhaps more commonly identify\nworlds with maximal propositions or with constructions out of\npropositions (e.g. sets of propositions). Once we have representations\nthat are rich enough to represent every possibility, fictionalists\nneed to explain why they prefer to be be fictionalists rather than\nidentifying possible worlds with the appropriate representations.\n\nAbstractionist realism seems more straightforward than fictionalism in\na number of ways, so fictionalists, particularly platonist\nfictionalists, risk being victims of their own success and collapsing\ninto a kind of realism. (Nolan 1997a p 272 mentions this worry.) Rosen\n1990, particulary on pp 328\u20139, mentions some motivations for a\nfictionalist to not be an abstractionist. Turp 2011 discusses a\nsimilar challenge: on many accounts of the ontology of fiction,\nfictional worlds would themselves be some sort of existing abstract\nobject, of the sort that a fictionalist who wishes to reject\nabstractionism seems committed to rejecting. Finally, Dombrovszki 2017\nendorses the existence of the possible worlds postulated by a modal\nfiction: in his \u201chybrid modal fiction\u201d possible worlds are\ncreatures of fiction but nevertheless exist (much as so-called\n\u201cfictional realists\u201d hold that Sherlock Holmes is a\nfictional object that exists). If Dombrovszki is right, this is not so\nmuch a threat from abstractionism as an opportunity to be a modal\nfictionalist and a realist about possible worlds at the same time.\n\nConcern About Concern: Rosen 1990 (pp 349\u2013354)\ndiscusses an \u201cargument for concern\u201d against modal\nfictionalism, analogous to an argument from concern famously offered\nby Saul Kripke against David Lewis\u2019s counterpart theory. (Kripke\n1980 p 45) Hubert Humphrey, upon losing an election, cares that he\ncould have won. On the face of it, he does not care that someone like\nhim elsewhere in reality does win. Yet according to David\nLewis\u2019s analysis of what it is for Humphrey to have possibly\nwon, his possibly winning amounts to a \u201ccounterpart\u201d of\nHumphrey winning a (counterpart) election in another possible\nworld.\n\nLikewise, Humphrey presumably does not care very much whether a\nspecial story about him claims that he wins in an alternative\nuniverse. Rosen, along with many other philosophers, thinks that this\nwould not directly show there was any problem with a theory that\naccounted for the possibility of Humphrey winning in terms of the\ngoings-on in another concrete universe, or the contents of a\ndistinctive fiction: Humphrey might care about a fact without\nrealising what the analysis of that fact involves (Rosen 1990 p 349).\nRosen instead suggests there may be a \u201cpragmatic\u201d cost to\nthe view: those who come to accept it may have to revise substantially\nwhat they care about, either by caring more about the goings-on of a\nstory, or less about what could have happened. There is also the\nquestion of why we should care about what happens in any of the\nplausible candidate fictions: this perhaps touches on the question of\nchoosing a fiction discussed in 4.3, above.\n\nLewis 1986 pp 195\u2013197 argues that a version of the argument from\nconcern can be at least raised about any realist possible worlds\ntheory account of possibility: and, he would likely add, any\nfictionalist account as well. If Humphrey is unfamiliar with\npossible-worlds-jargon, he may not take himself to have any concern\nwith possible worlds when it hurts that he could have won. Of course,\ntheorists may wish to offer reasons why some accounts do better in\nrespecting the facts about what we are concerned with than others. (Or\nindeed give general reasons why no argument from concern is a\nchallenge to theories of possibility.)\n\nAbout Aboutness: Armour-Garb (2015, 1212\u20131218)\nraises a concern for a modal fictionalist seeking an \u201celliptical\nrendering\u201d of modal claims in terms of a claim about what is true\naccording to a fiction of possible worlds. It is that the modal claims\nwe begin with are not about the same things as the paraphrases in\nterms of a fiction of possible worlds. For example, instead of the claim that possibly, there are blue swans, which seems to be about swans and their color, we in effect get a claim about a fiction (we get a claim that means \u201caccording to MF, there are blue swans in a possible world\u201d). \n This is a problem, according to\nArmour-Garb, because the point of modal claims involves them being\nabout the things they normally seem to be about, so the modal\nfictionalist\u2019s substitute is inadequate. A theorist could, of\ncourse, endorse the fictionalist biconditional without thinking that\nmodal claims are about a fiction of worlds at all. Rosen 1990 does\ntalk, in the case of strong modal fictionalism, of an\n\u201canalysis\u201d of modal claims in terms of claims about what\nis true according to the modal fiction, so modal fictionalists who\nwant to follow him in this need to be clear about whether they think\nthis analysis gives the meaning of the modal claims they use. And if\nthe analysis is intended to give the meaning of modal expressions, they should make clear why\nit does not change the subject from what we took ourselves to be\nsaying all along.\n",
