    "main_text": "The Status of Determinism in Physical Theories || Special Relativistic physics\n4.2 Special Relativistic physics\n\nTwo features of special relativistic physics make it perhaps the most\nhospitable environment for determinism of any major theoretical\ncontext: the fact that no process or signal can travel faster than the\nspeed of light, and the static, unchanging spacetime structure. The\nformer feature, including a prohibition against tachyons (hypothetical\nparticles travelling faster than\n light)[5]),\n rules out space invaders and other unbounded-velocity systems. The\nlatter feature makes the space-time itself nice and stable and\nnon-singular\u2014unlike the dynamic space-time of General\nRelativity, as we shall see below. For source-free electromagnetic\nfields in special-relativistic space-time, a nice form of Laplacean\ndeterminism is provable. Unfortunately, interesting physics needs more\nthan source-free electromagnetic fields. Earman (1986) ch. IV surveys\nin depth the pitfalls for determinism that arise once things are\nallowed to get more interesting (e.g. by the addition of particles\ninteracting gravitationally).\n\n",
