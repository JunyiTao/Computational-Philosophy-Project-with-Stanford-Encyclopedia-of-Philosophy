The importance of social\ndiversity has long been emphasized in feminist epistemology, both for\nethical and epistemic reasons. For instance, many have pointed out\nthat social diversity is an important catalyst for cognitive\ndiversity, which in turn is vital for the diversity of perspectives,\nand therefore for scientific objectivity (Longino 1990, 2002; Haraway\n1989; Wylie 1992, 2002; Grasswick 2011; Anderson 1995; for a\ndiscussion on different notions of diversity in the context of\nscientific inquiry see Steel et al. 2018). \n\nMoreover, in the field of social psychology and organizational\nsciences, it has been argued that social diversity is epistemically\nbeneficial even if it doesn\u2019t promote cognitive diversity.\nInstead, it may counteract epistemically pernicious tendencies of\nhomogeneous groups, such as unwarranted trust in each other\u2019s\ntestimony or unwillingness to share dissenting opinions (for an\noverview of the literature see Page 2017; Fazelpour & Steel 2022).\nWhile these hypotheses have received support in virtue of empirical\nstudies, ABMs have proved a complementary testing ground, allowing for\nan investigation of minimal sets of conditions which need to hold for\nsocial diversity to be epistemically beneficial.\n\nAnother problem tackled by means of ABMs concerns factors that can\nundermine social diversity or disadvantage members of minorities in\nscience. For instance, how does one\u2019s minority status impact\none\u2019s position in a collaborative environment, given the norms\nof collaboration that can emerge in scientific communities? Or how\ndoes one\u2019s social identity impact the uptake of their ideas? We\nwill look at the models studying these issues in\n Section 4.4\n and\n Section 4.7.\n",
