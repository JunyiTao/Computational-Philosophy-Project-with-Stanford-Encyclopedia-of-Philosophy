    "main_text": "Issues || Democracy and Global Governance\n3.4 Democracy and Global Governance\n\nAs with human rights, feminist philosophers have argued that\nglobalization has contradictory implications for democratic\ngovernance. On the one hand, neoliberalism has diminished national\nsovereignty, further excluding women and the poor from democratic\nprocesses (Herr 2003). Yet globalization also connects people across\nnational borders, creating transnational communities that offer new\navenues for democratic participation. \n\nGlobalization has been accompanied by the establishment of formal\ndemocracy in some countries and the number of women serving in\nnational legislatures has increased in some nations. However, some\nfeminist philosophers are quick to argue that neoliberalism has not\nresulted in increased political influence for women on the whole,\nespecially at the level of global politics. One important reason is\nthat global economic institutions are neither adequately\nrepresentative nor fully democratic. Women are virtually absent from\nthe formal decision-making bodies of institutions such as the WTO and\nthe World Bank, and these institutions tend to be unofficially\ndominated by the interests of wealthy nations and multinational\ncorporations. \n\nFeminists argue that women\u2019s lack of political influence at the\nglobal level has not been compensated for by their increased influence\nin national politics because globalization has undermined national\nsovereignty, especially in poor nations. Structural adjustment\npolicies require debtor nations to implement specific domestic\npolicies that disproportionately harm women, such as austerity\nmeasures, despite strong local opposition. Trade rules issued by the\nWorld Trade Organization also supersede the national laws of signatory\nnations, including those pertaining to matters of ethics and public\npolicy, such as environmental protections and health and safety\nstandards for imported goods, as well as trade tariffs (Jaggar 2001,\n2002a). \n\nNor does women\u2019s participation in NGOs or other organizations\nwithin civil society guarantee that their interests will be fairly\nrepresented. Indeed, some feminists charge that foreign-funded NGOs\nare \u201ca new form of colonialism because they create dependence on\nnonelected overseas funders and their locally appointed officials,\nundermining the development of social programs administered by elected\nofficials accountable to local people\u201d (Jaggar 2001, 309). Even\nlocal, women-run NGOs sometimes fail to live up to their democratic\naspirations. NGO projects are often shaped by the agendas of their\ncorporate funders, to the detriment of the expressed needs of the\nwomen they serve. Demands for accountability to donors also limit the\ninternal democracy of NGOs by encouraging the professionalization of\ngrassroots organizations (Jaggar 2001, 2005a).\n\nWhile feminist philosophers agree that globalization has concentrated\npower in the hands of wealthy nations and corporations, further\nmarginalizing women and the global poor, some believe the conditions\nof globalization also enable new forms of democratic accountability.\nFor instance, Gould argues that participants in transnational\nassociations have equal rights to participate in decisions about their\ncommon activities. She also suggests that the Internet and other\ncommunication and information technologies, such open source software\nand online deliberative forums, can \u201chelp to increase both\ndemocratic participation and representation in the functioning of\ntransnational institutions\u201d (Gould 2009, 38).\n\nFraser (2009) further suggests that globalization has created new\ntransnational public spheres in which public opinion can be created\nand marshaled to hold political leaders democratically accountable.\nTraditional public sphere theory, such as that developed by Habermas,\ndefines the public sphere as an area of social life in which\nindividuals come together to reach a common public opinion about\nsocial issues. Insofar as the process of deliberation is fair and\ninclusive, the resulting public opinion is normatively legitimate;\nbecause it expresses the considered will of civil society, it can be\nmobilized as a political force to hold public power democratically\naccountable.\n\nHowever, Fraser points out that these essential features of\npublicity\u2014normative legitimacy and political efficacy\u2014are\nnot easily associated with new transnational communicative arenas, in\nwhich territorially dispersed interlocutors interact through various\ndiscursive forms. The reason is that traditional public sphere theory\nimplicitly assumes a Westaphalian political model, in which\nco-citizens, with equal rights to participate, create public opinion\naddressed to a particular state. Thus, in her words:\n\n[i]t is difficult to associate the notion of legitimate public opinion\nwith communicative arenas in which the interlocutors are not fellow\nmembers of a political community, with equal rights to participate in\npolitical life. And it is hard to associate the notion of efficacious\ncommunicative power with discursive spaces that do not correlate with\nsovereign states (Fraser 2009, 77).\n\n\nNevertheless, she argues, we should not jettison the idea of a\ntransnational public sphere, provided that the notions of normative\nlegitimacy and political efficacy can be reformulated to apply to\ncommunication in transnational discursive arenas.\n",
