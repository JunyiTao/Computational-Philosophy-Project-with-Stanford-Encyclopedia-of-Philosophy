    "main_text": "Arguments Against Constructive Empiricism || The Hermeneutic Circle\n3.7 The Hermeneutic Circle\n\nAs noted in Section 1.6 above, the constructive empiricist says that\nwhat counts as observable is relative to who the observer is and what\nepistemic community that observer is part of. Since the observer is\nher- or himself the subject of scientific theory, what counts as\nobservable is also the subject of scientific theory. Here are two\nworries about the use of scientific theory as the determiner of\nobservability:\n\n\nRelativity: If a theory of observability determines\nwhat is observable, and empirical adequacy is assessed in terms of\nwhat is observable, then a theory of observability can name the terms\nof its own empirical adequacy. Empirical adequacy becomes radically\nrelative. With no objective, theory-independent constraints on\nempirical adequacy, it\u2019s \u201canything goes\u201d when it\ncomes to theory acceptance: one simply adopts the theory of\nobservability that underwrites the empirical adequacy of whichever\ntheory one is interested in accepting.\n\nCircularity: if scientific theory is the arbiter of\nobservability, then an individual has no choice but to use the theory\nof observability she accepts as a guide to observability, and hence as\na guide to empirical adequacy, and hence as a guide to whether or not\nto accept that very theory. But to use the theory as a guide to\nwhether or not to accept that theory involves the individual in\nepistemic circularity.\n\n\nThe constructive empiricist might reply to Relativity by insisting\nthat while we must look to science for an account of observability,\nobservability is not a theory-dependent notion. What counts as\nobservable is an objective, theory-independent fact. So there\u2019s\nno danger of relativism about empirical adequacy (van Fraassen 1980,\n57\u201358).\n\nThis response only addresses Relativity; the objectivity of\nobservability does not save us from the epistemic circularity that\ncomes about from our having to use a theory of observability as the\nstandard of empirical adequacy by which we assess that theory\u2019s\nown empirical adequacy. The epistemic circularity has to do with how\nwe come to certain beliefs about observability, not with the\nobjectivity of the observability facts.\n\nIf such circularity were avoidable, then it would be good for us to\navoid it. Unfortunately for us, the constructive empiricist might say,\nit is not avoidable (Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 415\u2013416,\nmaintains this line). Advocates of constructive empiricism might\ninsist that any search for a Cartesian-style guarantee of the\ncorrectness of our theory of observability is a search in vain. We\nhave to accept some such theory, imperfect though it may be, and\nmodify our acceptance if experience proves that acceptance to be\nmisplaced.\n",
