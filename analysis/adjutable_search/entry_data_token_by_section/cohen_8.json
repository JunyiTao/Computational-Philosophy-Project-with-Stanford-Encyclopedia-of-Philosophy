    "main_text": "Monotheism and Prophetic Messianism\n9. Monotheism and Prophetic Messianism\n\nCohen\u2019s second aim in the Religion is to show that\nJudaism has what he calls a special \u201cmethodological\u201d\nsignificance for philosophy of religion, because it is the original\nhistorical source of a religion of reason (Cohen 1972 [1919], 8).\nJudaism has this special status because it was, Cohen contends, the\noriginal monotheistic religion, and only monotheistic religions can be\nreligions of reason. The polytheism of the ancient world posited\ndifferent gods for different peoples in different places. But, Cohen\nargues, since reason is a \u201cuniversal human power\u201d that\nbelongs to all humanity (Cohen 1972 [1919], 7\u20138), a religion of\nreason cannot recognize different gods for different people, but must\nrecognize a single, unique God for all humanity. Since the idea of\nsuch a God first emerged in history with Judaism, it is the original\nsource of a religion of reason. Consequently, the investigation of a\nreligion of reason must recover that religion\u2019s source by\ninterpreting the historical scriptures and liturgical practices of\nJudaism (Kepnes 2007, Ch. 2).\n\nAccording to Cohen, monotheism, and so too Judaism, was the historical\nsource of the idea that all humanity could be unified by a single set\nof ethical laws. As Cohen sees it, God is the set of ideal ethical\nlaws. To assert that there is only one God for all of humanity is thus\nto assert a universal ethical ideal, one on which individuals see all\npeople as \u201cfellow humans,\u201d and not as \u201cothers\u201d\nwho can be excluded from the moral community (Cohen 1972 [1919],\n14ff). Later religion scholars such as Wendell Dietrich would call\nthis doctrine \u201cethical monotheism\u201d (Cf. Dietrich 1986 and\nTheodore and Hadley 2001). Cohen thinks that because monotheism has an\nethical dimension, it culminates in\u2014its highest form is\u2014a\nview he calls prophetic messianism. For Cohen, messianism just is\n\u201cthe dominion of the good on earth.\u201d It is the view that\nthe Messiah\u2019s coming consists in nothing but the ultimate end of\ninjustice (Cohen 1972 [1919], 21). Prophetic messianism is thus an\nexpression of faith that humanity is making progress towards realizing\nideal ethical laws.\n\nCohen\u2019s conception of the essentially ethical nature of Judaism\nhad important consequences for his view of Judaism\u2019s relation to\nother religions, as well as his views of Zionism and the Jews\u2019\nplace in Wilhelmine Germany. Because Cohen thought the ethical nature\nof Judaism was expressed by its monotheism, he believed that at least\nsome forms of Christianity had the same ethical nature. While for\nCohen Judaism was the original religion of reason, liberal\nProtestantism expresses universal ethical ideals and is a religion of\nreason as well. (He thought Catholicism failed to express properly\nuniversal ideals. He seems not to have considered Islam.) At the same\ntime, because for Cohen Judaism ultimately aims at an ethical ideal\nthat includes all humanity, he rejected the nationalism he saw in\nnon-liberal forms of Judaism and was a vocal critic of Zionism. In a\npublic exchange with Martin Buber, Cohen argued that Jews had an\nobligation to remain in their countries of birth, so that their\nreligious communities could serve as exemplars for the rest of\nhumanity of communities unified by ethical laws. He died in 1918,\nbefore the increasing virulence of antisemitism in Germany could make\nhim reconsider this argument.\n",
