    "main_text": "Omnipotence and the Shared Histories Approach\n5. Omnipotence and Divine Moral Perfection\n\nIt has been argued that the traditional God has incompatible\nattributes, namely, necessary existence, essential omnipotence,\nessential omniscience, and essential moral perfection (Pike\n 1969).[7]\n The contention has been that it is impossible for God to have the\npower to bring about evil, while non-omnipotent (and morally\nimperfect) beings may have this power. The precise form of such an\nargument varies depending on what precisely the relation between God\nand evil is assumed to be. However, generally speaking, it is argued\nthat divine moral perfection and omnipotence are incompatible because\ndivine omnipotence entails that God has the power to bring about evil,\nwhereas divine moral perfection entails that God is powerless to bring\nabout evil.\n\nOne can respond to arguments of this kind as follows. Assume that if\nGod exists, then this is a best possible\n world.[8]\n In that case, if God exists, there could not be an evil unless it\nwere necessary for some greater good, in which case any state of\naffairs containing evil incompatible with there being a maximally good\nworld is impossible. But it be may be assumed that it is not\npossible for any agent to bring about an impossible state of\naffairs. Thus, if God exists, any moral evil, that is, any evil\nbrought about by anyone, and any natural evil, or any evil which has\nan impersonal, natural cause, must be necessary for some greater\ngood.\n\nSuppose that God exists and that some other person, for example, Cain,\nbrings it about that an evil, \\(E\\), exists. There are\ntwo possibilities that need to be considered here. The first is that\nCain\u2019s decisions and actions are causally determined, as are all\noccurrences in the created universe. Then, given our assumptions,\nsince Cain\u2019s bringing it about that \\(E\\) exists\nis necessary for some good which more than compensates for \\(E\\)\u2019s\nexistence, it is consistent with God\u2019s\nmoral perfection that God [remotely] brings it about that Cain brings\nit about that \\(E\\) exists.\n\nThe second possibility is that Cain\u2019s decision to do evil is\nuncaused by anything other than Cain and free in the libertarian\nsense. In that case, God did not [remotely cause Cain freely\nto] bring it about that \\(E\\) exists, while [let us\nassume] Cain did freely bring it about that \\(E\\)\nexists. If so, then it must be the case that\nGod\u2019s creating Cain and permitting Cain freely to do what he\nchooses to do [in the context of the entire creation] brings about\nmore good than his not creating Cain and thus not\npermitting him freely to do what he chooses to do. It might be\nobjected that if Cain can bring about a state of affairs that God\ncannot, namely, that E exists, then God is not omnipotent.\nBut, as we have seen, an agent\u2019s being omnipotent does not\nrequire of that agent that it be able to bring about every\nstate of affairs which any other agent can bring about. It\ndoes, of course, require that an omnipotent agent have more\npower than any other agent. And God, of course, would have\nmore power than Cain, even though Cain could bring about something\nthat God could not. For there are many more states of affairs that God\ncould bring about and that Cain could not, than vice versa.\nAt this point, it might further be objected that an omnipotent agent,\none that was morally imperfect, who could bring it about that\n\\(E\\) exists, as well as all the other states of\naffairs that God could bring about, would be more powerful than God.\nBut recall that if God exists, then he exists eternally in every\npossible world. Recall, too, that apparently there cannot be more than\none omnipotent agent. Thus, it appears that if God exists, then an\nomnipotent agent who is morally imperfect is impossible.\nThus, this second objection is based on an assumption that seems to be\nimpossible, namely, that if God exists there could exist another\nomnipotent agent who is morally imperfect and who is therefore more\npowerful than God.\n\nOf course, if God exists, then any evil state of affairs, \\(s\\),\nwhich is incompatible with a maximally good\nworld is impossible. And if \\(s\\) is\nimpossible, then neither God nor any other agent has the power to\nbring it about that \\(s\\) obtains. God would lack the\npower to bring it about that \\(s\\) obtains because of\nhis moral perfection, and any created agent would lack the power to\nbring it about that \\(s\\) obtains either because (i)\nGod would not create an agent who had the power to bring it about that\n\\(s\\) obtains, or (ii) God would not permit any created\nagent to bring it about that \\(s\\) obtains. Thus, to\nthe extent indicated, if God\u2019s attributes impose moral\nrestrictions on the nature of the universe and on what he can bring\nabout, then they impose parallel restrictions on what any other agents\ncan bring about.\n\nThe foregoing line of reasoning implies that God\u2019s moral\nperfection and omnipotence are not\n incompatible.[9]\n\nThis argument about God and the possibility of evil has been disputed\nby theists such as Alvin Plantinga, who do not hold that God\u2019s\nexistence implies the existence of a maximally good world, but do hold\nthat God seeks to create as good a world as he\n can.[10]\n Theists such as Plantinga allow for there to be evil that is\n unnecessary for any greater good that outweighs it. An evil\nof this kind involves free decisions of non-divine agents, which God\ndoes not prevent, but which these other agents can prevent. Plantinga\ncontends that God is not wrong to permit an evil of this kind, since\nGod cannot bring about a vital good, the existence of free human\nagents, without there being such an evil. Alternatively, it might be\nargued that God does no wrong in this sort of case, because he does\nnot know how to do better (knowledge of the future free actions of\ncreated agents being impossible). However, as an omnipotent God is\nnot required to have power over the free decisions of\nnon-divine agents, it follows that on these views, his omnipotence and\nmoral perfection are compatible, roughly to the extent indicated\nearlier in our discussion of the view that God\u2019s existence\nimplies a maximally good world. Of course, nothing that has been said\nhere answers the question of how much, if any, evil is compatible with\nthe existence of the traditional God. This question is central to the\nproblem of evil for theism.\n",
