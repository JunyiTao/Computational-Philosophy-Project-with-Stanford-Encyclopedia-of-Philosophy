    "main_text": "Model-theoretic definition\n2. Model-theoretic definition\n\nA sentence \\(S\\) divides all its possible interpretations into two\nclasses, those that are models of it and those that are not. In this\nway it defines a class, namely the class of all its models, written\n\\(\\Mod(S)\\). To take a legal example, the sentence \n\nThe first person has transferred the property to the second person,\nwho thereby holds the property for the benefit of the third person.\n\n\ndefines a class of structures which take the form of labelled\n4-tuples, as for example (writing the label on the left): \n\nthe first person = Alfonso Arblaster;\nthe property = the derelict land behind Alfonso\u2019s\nhouse;\nthe second person = John Doe;\nthe third person = Richard Roe.\n\n\nThis is a typical model-theoretic definition, defining a class of\nstructures (in this case, the class known to the lawyers as\ntrusts). \n\nWe can extend the idea of model-theoretic definition from a single\nsentence \\(S\\) to a set \\(T\\) of sentences; \\(\\Mod(T)\\) is the class\nof all interpretations that are simultaneously models of all the\nsentences in \\(T\\). When a set \\(T\\) of sentences is used to define a\nclass in this way, mathematicians say that \\(T\\) is a theory\nor a set of axioms, and that \\(T\\) axiomatises the\nclass \\(\\Mod(T)\\).\n\nTake for example the following set of first-order sentences:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\forall x\\forall y\\forall z (x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z). \\\\\n& \\forall x (x + 0 = x). \\\\\n& \\forall x (x + (-x) = 0). \\\\\n& \\forall x\\forall y (x + y = y + x). \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nHere the labels are the addition symbol \u2018+\u2019, the minus\nsymbol \u2018\\(-\\)\u2019 and the constant symbol \u20180\u2019. An\ninterpretation also needs to specify a domain for the quantifiers.\nWith one proviso, the models of this set of sentences are precisely\nthe structures that mathematicians know as abelian groups.\nThe proviso is that in an abelian group \\(A\\), the domain should\ncontain the interpretation of the symbol 0, and it should be closed\nunder the interpretations of the symbols + and \\(-\\). In mathematical\nmodel theory one builds this condition (or the corresponding\nconditions for other function and constant symbols) into the\ndefinition of a structure. \n\nEach mathematical structure is tied to a particular first-order\nlanguage. A structure contains interpretations of certain predicate,\nfunction and constant symbols; each predicate or function symbol has a\nfixed arity. The collection \\(K\\) of these symbols is called the\nsignature of the structure. Symbols in the signature are\noften called nonlogical constants, and an older name for them\nis primitives. The first-order language of signature \\(K\\) is\nthe first-order language built up using the symbols in \\(K\\), together\nwith the equality sign =, to build up its atomic formulas. (See the\nentry on\n classical logic.)\n If \\(K\\) is a signature, \\(S\\) is a sentence of the language of\nsignature \\(K\\) and \\(A\\) is a structure whose signature is \\(K\\),\nthen because the symbols match up, we know that \\(A\\) makes \\(S\\)\neither true or false. So one defines the class of abelian groups to be\nthe class of all those structures of signature \\(+\\), \\(-\\), \\(0\\) which are\nmodels of the sentences above. Apart from the fact that it uses a\nformal first-order language, this is exactly the algebraists\u2019\nusual definition of the class of abelian groups; model theory\nformalises a kind of definition that is extremely common in\nmathematics.\n\nNow the defining axioms for abelian groups have three kinds of symbol\n(apart from punctuation). First there is the logical symbol = with a\nfixed meaning. Second there are the nonlogical constants, which get\ntheir interpretation by being applied to a particular structure; one\nshould group the quantifier symbols with them, because the structure\nalso determines the domain over which the quantifiers range. And third\nthere are the variables \\(x, y\\) etc. This three-level pattern of\nsymbols allows us to define classes in a second way. Instead of\nlooking for the interpretations of the nonlogical constants that will\nmake a sentence true, we fix the interpretations of the\nnonlogical constants by choosing a particular structure \\(A\\), and we\nlook for assignments of elements of \\(A\\) to variables which will make\na given formula true in \\(A\\).\n\nFor example let \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) be the additive group of integers. Its\nelements are the integers (positive, negative and 0), and the symbols\n\\(+\\), \\(-\\), \\(0\\) have their usual meanings. Consider the formula\n\n\\[\nv_1 + v_1 = v_2.\n\\]\n\n\nIf we assign the number \\(-3\\) to \\(v_1\\) and the number \\(-6\\) to\n\\(v_2\\), the formula works out as true in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). We express\nthis by saying that the pair \\((-3,-6)\\) satisfies this\nformula in \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\). Likewise (15,30) and (0,0) satisfy\nit, but \\((2,-4)\\) and (3,3) don\u2019t. Thus the formula\ndefines a binary relation on the integers, namely the set of\npairs of integers that satisfy it. A relation defined in this way in a\nstructure \\(A\\) is called a first-order definable relation in\n\\(A\\). A useful generalisation is to allow the defining formula to use\nadded names for some specific elements of \\(A\\); these elements are\ncalled parameters and the relation is then definable with\nparameters. \n\nThis second type of definition, defining relations inside a structure\nrather than classes of structure, also formalises a common\nmathematical practice. But this time the practice belongs to geometry\nrather than to algebra. You may recognise the relation in the field of\nreal numbers defined by the formula \n\n\\[\nv_1^2 + v_2^2 = 1.\n\\]\n\n\nIt\u2019s the circle of radius 1 around the origin in the real plane.\nAlgebraic geometry is full of definitions of this kind. \n\nDuring the 1940s it occurred to several people (chiefly Anatolii\nMal\u2019tsev in Russia, Alfred Tarski in the USA and Abraham\nRobinson in Britain) that the metatheorems of classical logic could be\nused to prove mathematical theorems about classes defined in the two\nways we have just described. In 1950 both Robinson and Tarski were\ninvited to address the International Congress of Mathematicians at\nCambridge Mass. on this new discipline (which as yet had no name\n\u2013 Tarski proposed the name \u2018theory of models\u2019 in\n1954). The conclusion of Robinson\u2019s address to that Congress is\nworth quoting:\n\n[The] concrete examples produced in the present paper will have shown\nthat contemporary symbolic logic can produce useful tools \u2013\nthough by no means omnipotent ones \u2013 for the development of\nactual mathematics, more particularly for the development of algebra\nand, it would appear, of algebraic geometry. This is the realisation\nof an ambition which was expressed by Leibniz in a letter to Huyghens\nas long ago as 1679. (Robinson 1952, 694)\n\n\nIn fact Mal\u2019tsev had already made quite deep applications of\nmodel theory in group theory several years earlier, but under the\npolitical conditions of the time his work in Russia was not yet known\nin the West. By the end of the twentieth century, Robinson\u2019s\nhopes had been amply fulfilled; see the entry on\n first-order model theory.\n\nThere are at least two other kinds of definition in model theory\nbesides these two above. The third is known as interpretation\n(a special case of the interpretations that we began with). Here we\nstart with a structure \\(A\\), and we build another structure \\(B\\)\nwhose signature need not be related to that of \\(A\\), by defining the\ndomain \\(X\\) of \\(B\\) and all the labelled relations and functions of\n\\(B\\) to be the relations definable in \\(A\\) by certain formulas with\nparameters. A further refinement is to find a definable equivalence\nrelation on \\(X\\) and take the domain of \\(B\\) to be not \\(X\\) itself\nbut the set of equivalence classes of this relation. The structure\n\\(B\\) built in this way is said to be interpreted in the\nstructure \\(A\\).\n\nA simple example, again from standard mathematics, is the\ninterpretation of the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) of integers in the\nstructure \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) consisting of the natural numbers 0, 1, 2\netc. with labels for 0, 1 and +. To construct the domain of\n\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) we first take the set \\(X\\) of all ordered pairs of\nnatural numbers (clearly a definable relation in \\(\\mathbb{N})\\), and\non this set \\(X\\) we define the equivalence relation \\(\\sim\\) by\n\n\\[\n(a,b) \\sim(c,d) \\text{ if and only if } a + d = b + c\n\\]\n\n\n(again definable). The domain of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) consists of the\nequivalence classes of this relation. We define addition on\n\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) by  \n\n\\[\n(a,b) + (c,d) = (e,f) \\text{ if and only if } a + c + f = b + d + e.\n\\]\n\n\nThe equivalence class of \\((a,b)\\) becomes the integer \\(a - b\\). \n\nWhen a structure \\(B\\) is interpreted in a structure \\(A\\), every\nfirst-order statement about \\(B\\) can be translated back into a\nfirst-order statement about \\(A\\), and in this way we can read off the\ncomplete theory of \\(B\\) from that of \\(A\\). In fact if we carry out\nthis construction not just for a single structure \\(A\\) but for a\nfamily of models of a theory \\(T\\), always using the same defining\nformulas, then the resulting structures will all be models of a theory\n\\(T'\\) that can be read off from \\(T\\) and the defining formulas. This\ngives a precise sense to the statement that the theory \\(T'\\) is\ninterpreted in the theory \\(T\\). Philosophers of science have\nsometimes experimented with this notion of interpretation as a way of\nmaking precise what it means for one theory to be reducible to\nanother. But realistic examples of reductions between scientific\ntheories seem generally to be much subtler than this simple-minded\nmodel-theoretic idea will allow. See the entry on\n intertheory relations in physics.\n\nThe fourth kind of definability is a pair of notions, implicit\ndefinability and explicit definability of a particular relation in a\ntheory. See section 3.3 of the entry on\n first-order model theory.\n\nUnfortunately there used to be a very confused theory about\nmodel-theoretic axioms, that also went under the name of implicit\ndefinition. By the end of the nineteenth century, mathematical\ngeometry had generally ceased to be a study of space, and it had\nbecome the study of classes of structures which satisfy certain\n\u2018geometric\u2019 axioms. Geometric terms like\n\u2018point\u2019, \u2018line\u2019 and \u2018between\u2019\nsurvived, but only as the primitive symbols in axioms; they no longer\nhad any meaning associated with them. So the old question, whether\nEuclid\u2019s parallel postulate (as a statement about space) was\ndeducible from Euclid\u2019s other assumptions about space, was no\nlonger interesting to geometers. Instead, geometers showed that if one\nwrote down an up-to-date version of Euclid\u2019s other assumptions,\nin the form of a theory \\(T\\), then it was possible to find models of\n\\(T\\) which fail to satisfy the parallel postulate. (See the entry on\n geometry in the 19th century\n for the contributions of Lobachevski and Klein to this achievement.)\nIn 1899 David Hilbert published a book in which he constructed such\nmodels, using exactly the method of interpretation that we have just\ndescribed.\n\nProblems arose because of the way that Hilbert and others described\nwhat they were doing. The history is complicated, but roughly the\nfollowing happened. Around the middle of the nineteenth century people\nnoticed, for example, that in an abelian group the minus function is\ndefinable in terms of 0 and + (namely: \\(-a\\) is the element \\(b\\)\nsuch that \\(a + b = 0)\\). Since this description of minus is in fact\none of the axioms defining abelian groups, we can say (using a term\ntaken from J. D. Gergonne, who should not be held responsible for the\nlater use made of it) that the axioms for abelian groups\nimplicitly define minus. In the jargon of the time, one said\nnot that the axioms define the function minus, but that they define\nthe concept minus. Now suppose we switch around and try to\ndefine plus in terms of minus and 0. This way round it can\u2019t be\ndone, since one can have two abelian groups with the same 0 and minus\nbut different plus functions. Rather than say this, the nineteenth\ncentury mathematicians concluded that the axioms only partially define\nplus in terms of minus and 0. Having swallowed that much, they went on\nto say that the axioms together form an implicit definition of the\nconcepts plus, minus and 0 together, and that this implicit definition\nis only partial but it says about these concepts precisely as much as\nwe need to know.\n\nOne wonders how it could happen that for fifty years nobody challenged\nthis nonsense. In fact some people did challenge it, notably the\ngeometer Moritz Pasch who in section 12 of his Vorlesungen\n\u00fcber Neuere Geometrie (1882) insisted that geometric axioms\ntell us nothing whatever about the meanings of \u2018point\u2019,\n\u2018line\u2019 etc. Instead, he said, the axioms give us\nrelations between the concepts. If one thinks of a structure\nas a kind of ordered \\(n\\)-tuple of sets etc., then a class\n\\(\\Mod(T)\\) becomes an \\(n\\)-ary relation, and Pasch\u2019s account\nagrees with ours. But he was unable to spell out the details, and\nthere is some evidence that his contemporaries (and some more recent\ncommentators) thought he was saying that the axioms may not determine\nthe meanings of \u2018point\u2019 and \u2018line\u2019, but they\ndo determine those of relational terms such as \u2018between\u2019\nand \u2018incident with\u2019! Frege\u2019s demolition of the\nimplicit definition doctrine was masterly, but it came too late to\nsave Hilbert from saying, at the beginning of his Grundlagen der\nGeometrie, that his axioms give \u2018the exact and\nmathematically adequate description\u2019 of the relations\n\u2018lie\u2019, \u2018between\u2019 and \u2018congruent\u2019.\nFortunately Hilbert\u2019s mathematics speaks for itself, and one can\nsimply bypass these philosophical faux pas. The model-theoretic\naccount that we now take as a correct description of this line of work\nseems to have surfaced first in the group around Giuseppe Peano in the\n1890s, and it reached the English-speaking world through Bertrand\nRussell\u2019s Principles of Mathematics in 1903.\n",
