Female Dependency and Didactic Texts for Women\n\nAs a person of nei, ritually speaking, a woman is without\nrank, title, or name of her own. And hence it is by necessity that a\nwoman throughout her life cycle is dictated by the doctrine of\n\u201cthree-fold following/dependency\u201d (sancong\n\u4e09\u5f9e): when young, she follows her father, when married,\nher husband, when widowed, her sons. The advantage of translating\ncong \u5f9e as following/dependency instead of obedience is\nthat the principle of generational seniority is one of the mitigating\nfactors in the Chinese gender system where not only is the position of\nmother accorded with accolades textually and ritually, but also is in\nactual possession of a tremendous amount of power over the sons\nhowever grand the sons\u2019 social stations may be: emperors,\ngenerals, prime ministers, or famed scholars.\n\nThe iconic maternal model of Mengmu\u2014the widowed mother of\nMencius\u2014is a case in point. As recorded in the Exemplary\nWomen\u2019s Biographies (Lien\u00fc zhuan) 1.11,\nMencius was displeased with his wife for what he perceived as her lack\nof ritual propriety in their private quarter; instead of sending her\ndaughter-in-law back to her natal family, Mengmu reprimanded Mencius\nfor his own lack of ritual propriety by entering their private quarter\nwithout first announcing himself as the instigating cause of this\nfamilial discord (for translation see Kinney 2014). It is clear from\nthis famed tale of Mengmu that the widowed mother continued to\nexercise her maternal authority over the adult son, overriding his\ndecisions even on his spousal relations. Nonetheless, even a revered\nwidowed mother is still ritually a person without rank, title, or name\nof her own. The iconic case of Mengmu is after all memorialized as the\nmother of Mencius who went on to achieve great literary and political\nfame!\n",
