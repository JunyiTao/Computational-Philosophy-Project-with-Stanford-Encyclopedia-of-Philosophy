    "main_text": "The System of Necessity || Reid\u2019s alternative\n1.1 Reid\u2019s alternative\n\nIn Reid\u2019s view, then, the System of Necessity fails to offer an\naccurate account of human agency. What alternative account of agency\ndid Reid propose? One that accepts the following three claims:\n\n\n(1\u2032) Every human action has a cause, which in the case of free\nhuman action is not itself a motive, but the agent himself.\n\n(2\u2032) Motives are not mental states but the ends for which an\nagent acts.\n\n(3\u2032) Human action is nomic only to this extent: If an agent\nfails to exercise autonomy when deliberating (and he is not in a state\nof indifference), then his strongest desire to act in a certain way\nwill prevail. If he exercises autonomy when deliberating, however,\nthen he will act on the motive that seems to him most rationally\nappropriate.\n\n\nLet us consider these three claims in turn.\n\nThe first statement, (1\u2032), expresses Reid\u2019s commitment to\nan agent causal account of human free action. Reid presents various\narguments for this view in Essays on the Active Powers of\nMan, but it is worth emphasizing that a central consideration\nthat Reid furnishes in its favor appeals not to common sense but to\nwhat science appears to tell us. Reid, like most of his\ncontemporaries, was a Newtonian. In Reid\u2019s judgment, however,\nNewtonian science is committed to the claim \u201cthat matter is a\nsubstance altogether inert, and merely passive; that gravitation, and\nthe other attractive or repulsive powers \u2026 are not inherent in\nits nature, but impressed upon it by some external cause\u201d (EAP\nI.vi: 34). Matter, according to this view, does not cause anything. On\nthe assumptions that there is genuine causality in the world and that\nagents are causes, it follows that agents, who are not material\nthings, in Reid\u2019s view, are the only causes. Reid takes\nNewtonian science to imply a mitigated version of occasionalism\naccording to which the only genuine causation in the world is agent\ncausation.\n\nThe second statement above, (2\u2032), expresses Reid\u2019s\ncommitment to a broadly teleological account of human agency,\naccording to which autonomous human action is explained not by the\nimpulses that present themselves to an agent when deliberating but by\nthe ends for which she acts. In his defense of this view, Reid argues\nthat, contrary to the adherents of the System of Necessity, motives\nare not mental states that cause us to act, for motives are not the\nright sort of thing to be causes: They are not agents. In some places,\nin fact, Reid says that motives (as he thinks of them) have no\n\u201creal existence,\u201d by which he seems to mean (at least)\nthat they are not part of the spatio-temporal manifold but are\nabstracta (see EAP IV.iv: 214).\n\nThese claims might take us aback: Motives are not causes and have no\nreal existence? How could that be? When evaluating these claims, two\nthings should be noted. First, Reid is working with a rather narrow\nunderstanding of what it is for something to be a cause (and to\nexist)\u2014an understanding, we\u2019ve seen, he thinks fits best\nwith a Newtonian understanding of the world. Second, Reid\u2019s\nconsidered view about the role of motives is actually more complicated\nthan (2\u2032) would have us believe. (2\u2032) expresses the view\nthat Reid defends in Essay IV of Essays on the Active Powers,\n\u201cOf the Liberty of Moral Agents.\u201d But anyone who has read\nEssay III, \u201cOf the Principles of Action,\u201d knows that Reid\nclaims that motives or \u201cprinciples of action\u201d divide into\nthree kinds: mechanical, animal, and rational. Mechanical principles\nof action are what we would call instincts, such as the unreflective\nimpulse to protect oneself from perceived harm. Animal principles of\naction are a more varied lot. Under this category, Reid places the\nso-called benevolent affections, such as the affection felt between\nkin, gratitude to benefactors, pity and compassion, friendship, public\nspirit, and the like (see EAP III.iii.iv). He also includes the\nso-called malevolent affections, such as resentment and the desire to\ndominate others. (In section III, we will see a reason to believe that\nsome animal principles, by Reid\u2019s own lights, are not ones that\ncould be had by the animals.)\n\nAll this complicates Reid\u2019s picture. Reid seems to want to allow\nthat motives come in two varieties. On the one hand, Reid says that\nrational motives function as \u201cadvice\u201d or\n\u201cexhortation\u201d which do not push but pull us to action. On\nthe other, he describes the mechanical and animal motives as\n\u201cimpulses,\u201d which do not pull but push us to action (EAP\nII.ii and IV.iv). How best to understand what Reid is saying? Perhaps\nthe best conclusion to draw is that Reid does not have a unified\naccount of motives. Some of the rational motives are best described as\nbeing either those ends for which we act or principles by which we\nevaluate those ends for which we act. Other motives\u2014the\nmechanical and a range of the animal ones\u2014are not; they are what\npush or impel us to action (see Cuneo and Harp 2016).\n\nAre these latter motives best described as having a causal influence\non behavior? Perhaps they are, according to a more relaxed\nunderstanding of causality than that with which Reid officially works.\nFor suppose we agree that there are processes that are instigated by\nthe exercise of active power, such as the process that is instigated\nby an agent\u2019s willing to raise her arm. In Reid\u2019s view,\nthis process includes the exercise of active power, which is the\nagent\u2019s willing to raise her arm, the activity of nerves and\nmuscles and, finally, the raising of her arm. If we allow ourselves to\ntalk of elements of this process as causes in a \u201clax and popular\nsense,\u201d then perhaps some motives, in Reid\u2019s view, could\nbe called causes. Of course Reid would have to say that in some cases\nthe motives that \u201ccause\u201d us to act are not part of a\ncausal process that we ourselves instigate. Not every desire or mental\nstate we have is the causal consequence of the exercise of our active\npower in a given way. (That I desire to eat an ice cream cone, for\nexample, appears to be a causal consequence not of the exercise of my\nactive power but of your handing me an ice cream cone.) Reid would\nhave to say, then, that those mental states and events that are not\nsimply the causal consequence of the exercise of active power are\nparts of processes instigated by some other agent cause, such as God.\nThis may seem odd. But it seems to be the broader picture within which\nReid operated. All causal processes in nature (which are not due to\nus) are instigated by the exercise of God\u2019s active power. A\ntypical case of human action involves the coincidence of the exercise\nof our active power with God\u2019s (see EAP I.vi and Cuneo\n2011a).\n\nLet us now turn to the third statement above, namely, (3\u2032). This\nclaim expresses Reid\u2019s two-fold conviction that free human\naction is (i) not in any interesting sense nomic, and (ii) that we can\nassess our motives along two dimensions. We can assess them, first,\naccording to their psychological strength and, second, according to\ntheir rational authority.\n\nThat free human action is not nomic is simply an implication of\nReid\u2019s conviction that we are endowed with libertarian free\nwill, the exercise of which does not fall under any natural law in the\nsense described by Newtonian science. That our motives can be assessed\nalong two dimensions, by contrast, is an implication of Reid\u2019s\nregulation account of autonomy.\n\nTo see how Reid is thinking about the strength of motives, consider a\ncase in which you are moved to action by some animal principle of\naction. Imagine, for example, you are incited to reprimand someone in\nyour family because you believe that he or she has acted irresponsibly\nby leaving a kitchen light on during the night. One way to assess this\naction would be to ask whether it conforms to the rational principles\nof action. Let us suppose that, in the case we are considering, by\nreprimanding you risk alienating yourself from those with whom you\nlive; the circumstances you\u2019re in call for a calm and measured\nresponse. While there may be good reasons to alienate yourself from\nothers, expressing your anger in these circumstances is not one of\nthem. This motive in these circumstances, then, has no rational\nauthority.\n\nNow consider the same motive not with respect to its rational\nauthority but with regard to its psychological strength. Is this\nmotive the strongest of your motives? Reid maintains that this is a\ndifficult question to answer. One of the complaints Reid raises about\nthe System of Necessity is that it sheds no light on the matter.\nAlthough advocates of the System of Necessity claim that human actions\ncan be subsumed under natural laws, the laws to which they appeal in\norder to assess the strength of motives are either false or trivial.\nFor recall that, according to the System of Necessity:\n\n(3) Every human action is subsumable under a law, which specifies that\nfor any agent S, set of motives M, and action\nA at t, necessarily, if S performs\nA, then there is some member of M that is\nS\u2019s strongest motive, which causes S to\nperform A at t.\n\n\nReid finds this claim totally unpersuasive. It is worth quoting at\nlength what he has to say about it:\n\nIt is a question of fact, whether the influence of motives be fixed by\nlaws of nature, so that they shall always have the same effect in the\nsame circumstance. Upon this, indeed, the question about liberty and\nnecessity hangs. But I have never seen any proof that there are such\nlaws of nature, far less any proof that the strongest motive always\nprevails. However much our late fatalists have boasted of this\nprinciple as of a law of nature, without telling us what they mean by\nthe strongest motive, I am persuaded that, whenever they shall be\npleased to give us any measure of the strength of motives distinct\nfrom their prevalence, it will appear, from experience, that the\nstrongest motive does not always prevail. If no other test or measure\nof the strength of motives can be found but their prevailing, then\nthis boasted principle will be only an identical proposition, and\nsignify only that the strongest motive is the strongest motive\n\u2026 which proves nothing. (C, 176\u201377)\n\n\nAccording to Reid, (3), then, is either false or trivial (for\ndiscussion, see Yaffe 2004, Ch. 6).\n\nWe should now have a better picture of Reid\u2019s favored account of\nhuman agency. It is one according to which agents are causes, at least\nsome motives are not causes but ends, and autonomous action is\nnon-nomic. Earlier I said that this picture of agency grounds his\nnon-naturalist account of the ethical domain. Let me now explain\nhow.\n",
