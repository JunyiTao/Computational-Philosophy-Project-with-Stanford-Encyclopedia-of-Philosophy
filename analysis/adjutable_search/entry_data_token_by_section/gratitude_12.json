    "main_text": "Accounts of Gratitude || Gratitude as Virtue\n4.4 Gratitude as Virtue\n\nSeveral philosophers have argued that gratitude is best construed as a\nvirtue (Meilaender 1984; Wellman 1999b). Virtues are morally positive\ncharacter traits\u2014stable dispositions to think, feel and act in\ncertain ways under certain circumstances. Construed as a virtue,\ngratitude would be the stable disposition to respond to\ngratitude-worthy acts of beneficence with the beliefs, feelings and\nbehavioral tendencies (outlined in\n section 3)\n that characterize the properly grateful response (Manela 2019).\nConceiving of gratitude as a virtue has some plausibility. Like the\nconcept of emotion, virtue as a concept seems well-suited to\nintegrating the affective and motivational elements of the grateful\nresponse. Unlike emotions, though, virtues are dispositions,\nnot episodes, so they can be possessed without being occurrent.\nConceiving of gratitude as a virtue thus allows us to attribute\ngratitude to a beneficiary who may not be experiencing any grateful\nfeelings, beliefs or motivations in a given moment. Moreover,\nconstruing gratitude as a virtue captures nicely the moral\nphenomenology of how we tend to respond to evidence of ingratitude.\nWhen we respond critically to a beneficiary\u2019s act of ingratitude\nor lack of grateful feeling on some particular occasion, we are often\ncriticizing his character rather than some specific action or inaction\nor decision on his part (Wellman 1999b: 285). Furthermore, gratitude\nfits nicely into Aristotle\u2019s picture of virtue as a mean between\nan excess and a deficiency, with gratitude being a mean between the\nvices of arrogant, prideful or envious ingratitude, on one hand, and\nthe obsequiousness or servility of overgratitude, on the other (see\n section 3.5).\n Construing gratitude as a character trait that straddles two vices\nhas allowed philosophers to contribute to practical debates about\nteaching or training children to be properly grateful (see, e.g., Carr\net al. 2015; Manela 2019). And construing gratitude as a character\ntrait may provide a way for environmental ethicists to argue that we\nought to be grateful to nature even if, strictly speaking, nature is\nnot the sort of thing that can deserve gratitude (Hill 1983; cf.\nManela 2018).\n\nConceptualizing gratitude as a virtue, however, presents certain\ntheoretical pitfalls and drawbacks. For instance, conceptualizing\ngratitude as a virtue has tempted some philosophers (e.g., Wellman\n1999b) to infer that there is no such thing as an obligation\nof gratitude, though this inference may not be warranted (Manela\n2019). Furthermore, if gratitude were a virtue, then it should be\nnatural to ascribe it to certain people as a general, global character\ntrait, the way temperance, patience, or thoughtfulness might be\nascribed to someone. More often than not, however, people are not\ngrateful or ungrateful tout court, but grateful only\nvis-\u00e0-vis certain people, and ungrateful vis-\u00e0-vis\ncertain others. A man might be reliably predisposed to form and\nmaintain grateful feelings, beliefs and conations in response to\nbenevolence from strangers, but radically disinclined to form them in\nresponse to, say, a sibling or a parent. A person might not generally\nbe disposed to form grateful dispositions toward anyone, but might\nstill form a proper and lasting grateful disposition toward a\nparticular benefactor for a particular act of beneficence she\nperformed for him. Alternatively, a person might be generally inclined\nto form grateful dispositions toward the right people at the right\ntimes, but might lapse and fail to do so toward a particular person on\na particular occasion. Are such beneficiaries grateful? The lack of an\neasy answer, and the commonness of such cases, reminds us that when it\ncomes to gratitude, we are often interested in particular episodes or\ninstances of gratitude, not always global character traits like the\nvirtue of gratitude (Carr 2013; Manela 2019). \n",
