    "main_text": "Epistemology || Intuition and Authority, Knowledge and Faith\n2.2 Intuition and Authority, Knowledge and Faith\n\nAstell offers her account of knowledge and faith in order to explain\nthat people should become aware of how these two different ways of\napprehending truth are not just different, but rather that there are\nways in which faith is superior to knowledge. Many people hold that\nknowledge should be praised over faith because knowledge cannot be\ndisbelieved, whereas faith can. But Astell resists this view. She\nexplains that there are some aspects of faith that make it even more\npraiseworthy than knowledge, even though what is grasped by faith can\nbe disbelieved. Her account of knowledge is explained first, then her\naccount of faith, then her discussion of the different \u201cmodes of\nunderstanding\u201d that can arise from these when used in\ncombination. We conclude with a practical reason for why Astell finds\nthis discussion so important\u2014it is integral to current\ndiscussions about education and privilege, namely about the education\nof workers of all sexes and women of the gentry. \n\nOne of the first things to note about Astell\u2019s account of\nknowledge is how different it is from the view that is so often held\nby analytic philosophers of the 20th and 21st\ncenturies. According to the latter\u2019s view, knowledge is true,\njustified belief. Astell, however, holds a view of knowledge according\nto which it is marked by its origin, clarity, distinctness, and the\nmeans by which it is affirmed. On her view, the highest form of\nepistemic grasp that we have of truth is via an ability she calls\n\u201cintuition\u201d (146). She writes that intuition yields just a\nfew truths, each of which is self-evident (150). At one point she\ndescribes intuition as an \u201cimmediate View\u201d (Astell SP,\n149). As such, intuition is a capacity that directly apprehends\ntruths; this means that these direct apprehensions are not first\nbeliefs that later are found to be justified. Rather Astellian\nintuitions are themselves self-evident, not needing external\njustification. In the context of this discussion, Astell directly\ncites Descartes\u2019s words from Principles of Philosophy,\nPart I, section 45 (AT VIIIA 21\u20132; CSM I 207):\n\nThat (to use the Words of a Celebrated Author) may be said to be\n\u201cClear which is Present and Manifest to an attentive\nMind;\u201d so as we say we see Objects Clearly, when being present\nto our Eyes they sufficiently Act on \u2019em, and our Eyes are\ndispos\u2019d to regard \u2019em. And that Distinct, which is so\nClear, Particular, and Different from all other things, that it\ncontains not any thing in it self which appears not manifestly to him\nwho considers it as he ought. (Astell SP, 172)\n\nThough Astell uses some of Descartes\u2019s language when describing\nintuitions, she diverges from his views on issues of which ideas are\nclear and distinct, holding that ideas of God and of our own souls are\nclear, but not distinct (173), noting that although we can know some\nof the attributes of these substances, we cannot know their true\nnatures (173). In addition, she explains that we do not have a\ndistinct idea of God because he is infinite, and she notes that there\nare additional reasons for offering this view, though the\n\u201cReasons [are] too long to be mentioned here\u201d (173).\n\nShe does, however, explain that the idea of God is gained by\nintuition, and that according to this intuition we apprehend that\n\u201cGOD is One Simple Essence, Undivided, and Infinite in all\nPerfection\u201d (147). Astell explains that once we have some\nintuitions, we can draw deductions from them and thus attain\nadditional truths that themselves cannot be doubted. Astell uses the\nterm \u2018science\u2019 to describe this kind of knowledge (149).\nAstell does not give an example, but perhaps she has in mind\nDescartes\u2019s deductions of the laws of physics from the clear and\ndistinct perceptions of God and corporeal substance, for example, his\ndeduction of the law of conservation of motion and the law of inertia\n(Principles II, 36 and 37; CSM I 239\u201340; AT VIIIA\n61\u20133).\n\nBut there is another kind of truth that we hold, one apprehended in a\nquite different way from how we apprehend via intuition. This is\nfaith. Truths apprehended by faith are brought to us via authority\nversus intuition. When the authority is Divine (that is, when it is\nbrought by revelation), then we gain \u201cDivine faith\u201d (149).\nOur perceptions of these truths are clear or distinct (149). Astell\nuses the term \u2018opinion\u2019 to describe these apprehensions\nand all the additional truths that are deduced from them. \n\nIn some cases, we apprehend two truths, but we do not have a third\n\u201cmiddle\u201d term to compare them. For example, we apprehend\n(by both intuition and authority) that God is one simple\nessence that is undivided and infinite. In addition, we also apprehend\nby authority that God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (147). How can\nthese both be true? Astell explains that we have no third idea that we\ncould use to compare them. She explains that God did not impart this\nthird idea to us because it would be \u201ctoo dazzling, too bright\nfor Mortality to bear.\u201d Does this mean that it is unreasonable\nto accept these two truths? Not for Astell. She explains that we know\nboth, though we do not know the manner in which both are true\n(148). Though Astell does not give further explanation here of how a\n\u201cmiddle term\u201d would function to help us know the manner in\nwhich they are both true, she likely has in mind something like the\nfollowing: though we can apprehend both a triangle and a straight\nangle, we might be perplexed if someone told us that they were\nequivalent. Our confusion would be relieved once we realized that each\none measured 180 degrees. Thus \u201camount of degrees\u201d is the\nmanner in which the triangle and straight angle are\nequivalent. Similarly, we lack an idea that allows us to square (so to\nspeak) the seemingly opposed truths that God is simple and undivided\nwith the truth that God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Thus we must\nhold the congruity of two truths as a matter of faith. Astell gives\nadditional examples: we know and feel the mind-body union, but we know\nneither the \u201csecret ties\u201d that unite them nor how they\ninteract; we know we have liberty and we know God governs all, but we\ndo not have a middle term to reconcile these (see section 1.2 for a\nrelated discussion of these passages).\n\nWe can now address Astell\u2019s claim that knowledge (science) and\nfaith (opinion) are not merely on a par, but that there are ways in\nwhich faith is superior to knowledge. Note first that the two are\ndifferent in at least two ways: (1) they are the results of different\nabilities\u2014intuition (for knowledge/science) and authority (for\nfaith/opinion); and (2) they have different aspects to them, science\nbeing immutable and opinion being variable (150). However, as Astell\nexplains, these differences do not imply that one is rationally proved\nand thus certain and that the other is not. Rather, Astell emphasizes\nthat they are proved in different ways: \u201cScience Demonstrates\nthings that are Seen, so Faith is the Evidence of such as are Not\nSeen\u201d (150; note that Astell here references Hebrews\n11:1\u20136 from the Christian Bible). We should not expect that\nknowledge and faith work in the same way, as they are the results of\nsuch different capacities; as every sense has its proper object (the\neyes have colors, the ears have sounds, etc.), so every capacity of\nthe understanding has its proper object: science has as its objects\ntruths that can cannot be disbelieved (because of their clarity and/or\ndistinctness), whereas faith has as its objects truths that are not\nmarked by distinctness or clarity, and thus can admit of disbelief\n(151). Thus faith requires a deliberate activity of the will that\nknowledge does not: when we have knowledge, our will is compelled by\nthe clarity of the perception; but when we have faith, our will is not\nso compelled. Given this, faith has a special result that knowledge\nlacks; that is, faith involves an activity of the will that is capable\nof reward (151).\n\nIn addition, Astell explains that we should not claim that science is\nsomehow more certain than faith. In comparison with truths held by\nscience, we can gain as much if not more certainty when we hold a\ntruth via faith if we show (1) that God gave us the truth and (2) God\nis not deceived or a deceiver (151). Indeed, Astell holds that\nrevelation is an improvement on reason (147). \n\nFor Astell, what is most important is that we align our abilities with\ntheir proper objects: we should believe objects of faith, we should\nknow objects of knowledge (152). That is, we should not place faith in\nwhat is an object of science, nor should we adhere \u201cblindly to\nthe Dictates of some famous Philosopher in Physical Truths, the\nPrinciples of which we have as much right to examine, and to make\ndeductions from \u2018em as he had\u201d (152). \n\nThis connects to Astell\u2019s view on wisdom: \u201cto Know what is\nto be Known, and to Believe what is to be Believ\u2019d is the\nproperty of a Wise person\u201d (152). It also provides one of the\ntheoretical bases for Astell\u2019s views on education, which focuses\nin part on how to grasp truths that can be self-evident (see section\n3.2). Astell points out how this distinction between knowledge and\nbelief was playing a role in current controversies about gender,\neducation, and social rank (close to what we today understand as\nsocial class). Some of this discussion centered around issues of\npeople\u2019s free time that could be used for study. Locke, for\nexample, thought that men of the gentry and nobility had the time and\nmeans to gain knowledge, but that everyone else without these\ngendered, financial, and social privileges who lacked this time and/or\nthe means to improve themselves (and their \u201ccapacities\u201d)\ncould make do with belief. Consider what Locke writes in On the\nReasonableness of Christianity: \n\nThe greatest part of mankind want leisure or capacity for\ndemonstration, nor can they carry a train of proofs, which in that way\nthey must always depend upon for conviction, and cannot be required to\nassent to till they see the demonstration. Whenever they stick, the\nteachers are always put upon proof, and must clear the doubt, by a\nthread of coherent deductions from the first principle, how long, or\nhow intricate soever that be. And you may as soon hope to have all the\nday-labourers and tradesmen, the spinsters and dairy-maids, perfect\nmathematicians, as to have them perfect in ethics this way: hearing\nplain commands, is the sure and only course to bring them to obedience\nand practice. The greatest part cannot know, and therefore they must\nbelieve. (Reasonabless of Christianity, section 243 in\nLocke\u2019s Works, vol 7, p. 143, and see also\nReasonableness, section 302; see also Essay Concerning\nHuman Understanding 4.20.2\u20133; for a discussion of these\nissues, see Wolterstorff 1996, p. 71 ff.)\n\n\nWith his reference to \u201cday-labourers,\u201d\n\u201ctradesmen,\u201d \u201cspinsters,\u201d and\n\u201cdairy-maids,\u201d Locke is explicitly speaking of people of\nall genders who work with their hands. But the term\n\u2018spinster\u2019 can also refer to the single gentry\nwoman\u2014that is, to someone like Astell herself. Thus\nLocke\u2019s statement lends itself to the following interpretation:\nwhereas people with greater gendered, financial, and social privilege\nshould think for themselves, people who are without such privilege\nshould listen \u201cto plain commands.\u201d That is, they should be\ntold what to think without fully understanding why they should think\nthose things. In other words, they should follow authority, whether\nthat be God\u2019s authority or human authority. \n\nThere are important issues of consent involved here. Consider even on\nthe most charitable reading of Locke\u2019s statement, according to\nwhich he is speaking about wanting to make life easier for people who\ndo not have time and resources to gain education in religious matters\nand thus aim to serve them in their best interests. Who is to prevent\nthe kind of manipulation that can happen when a religious teacher\noversteps their bounds and issues \u201cplain commands\u201d that\nmanipulate people against their best interests? Shouldn\u2019t the\nsocially marginalized people be able to defend themselves against this\nkind of situation by fully understanding for themselves the truths\nthat are in their best interests? \n\nIt is for these kinds of reasons that Astell resists this view. In\ncontrast to Locke\u2019s view, she argues that all people,\nregardless of gender and social station (and thus temporal\nconstraints), have the ability to have clear and distinct ideas that\nare obtained by spiritual practices like the ones of philosophical\nmeditation that she and Descartes each offers. As she puts it,\n\u201cFor the difference between a plow-man and a Doctor does not\nseem to me to consist in this, That the Business of the one is to\nsearch after Knowledge, and that the other has nothing to do with\nit\u201d (Astell SP, 153). Further she writes: \u201cThe Meanest\nPerson shou\u2019d Think as Justly, tho\u2019 not as\nCapaciously, as the greatest Philosopher\u201d (168).\nAccording to Astell, no matter where a person is situated within the\nsocial strata of society and no matter what their gender is, they\nshould be able to have well-ordered thoughts\u2014that is, thoughts\nthat are \u201cjust.\u201d She admits that everyone may not have\ntime to have as many thoughts as someone else\u2014that is,\nthey may not have time to do vast amounts of empirical study, book\nlearning, and language learning as someone else who has more time to\ndedicate to these kinds of endeavors that would give them\n\u201ccapacious\u201d learning. But for Astell, such\ncapacious thinking is not as important as just\nthinking. In addition, the process of attaining just thinking does not\ntake a long amount of time, and everyone should be given the\nopportunity to think in this way. Thus, Astell advocates for\neveryone\u2019s need to have the kind of philosophical meditation\nthat yields well-ordered, harmonious thinking. \n",
