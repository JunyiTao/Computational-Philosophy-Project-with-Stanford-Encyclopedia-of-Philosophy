    "main_text": "Ontology and Categories\n6. Atomism\n\nCrathorn is less well known than other fourteenth-century atomists\nsuch as the Oxford thinkers Henry of Harclay (d. 1317) and Walter\nChatton (c. 1285\u20131344), or the Parisians Gerard of Odo\n(1290\u20131349), Nicolas Bonet (d. 1343), and Nicolas of Autrecourt\n(1299\u20131369) (Murdoch 1974, 1982; Grellard and Robert 2009), yet\nwe find several questions on the divisibility of the continuum in his\nSentences commentary (particularly I Sent., q. 3,\nbut also qq. 4 and 14\u201316). He affirms that a continuum is\ndivisible into a finite number of atoms that are not mathematical\npoints but its real, physical parts (I Sent., q. 3; for\ndiscussion, see Wood 1988, Robert 2009a). Atoms are thus real singular\nentities with discrete magnitude or quantity and a proper nature. For\nexample, he says that there are atoms of gold and atoms of lead, and\nthat these are different kinds of things (I Sent., q. 14).\nCrathorn\u2019s atomism is far from that of Democritus.\n\nThe most difficult problem for atomists arises from book VI of\nAristotle\u2019s Physics, where it becomes necessary to\ndefine the contiguity of atoms. Since an atom by definition has no\nparts, how can we say that they touch each other? If they are actually\nin contact, they should be in one and the same place (if not, then\nthere is no continuity since continuity requires contiguity). Crathorn\nreplies by saying that this is a problem only for those who think of\natoms as mathematical points. But since he holds that atoms have a\nproper magnitude and that they are defined by the fact that they\noccupy a single location (situs or locus), a\nquantity that is simply the place occupied by the quantified thing (I\nSent., qq. 3 and 14\u201315), the contiguity and continuity\nof atoms can be explained in terms of the contiguity of places. Atoms\ncan form a continuous magnitude if all of them are contiguous, i.e.,\nif they all occupy contiguous atomic places.\n\nThe implications of Crathorn\u2019s atomism are truly astonishing.\nFirst, every movement boils down to local motion of atoms in the void.\nThus, Crathorn affirms that a continuous motion has only one possible\nspeed, which is the greatest speed it could ever reach (Murdoch 1984).\nIn other words, movement is continuous when an atom changes from one\natomic place to another contiguous atomic place. The proportion of\ntime and place (i.e., the speed) is always equal to one. So how can he\nexplain the fact that things appear to move at different speeds? The\nanswer is quite simple: to every varying speed there corresponds a\ndiscontinuous motion, with times of rest between some of the atomic\nplaces occupied by the moving atoms (I Sent., q. 16, concl.\n6). For example, the normal speed of an atom a corresponds to\nits local motion from a place p1 to another contiguous place\np2 in a given atomic time. Variation of speed occurs if\na moves from p1 to p2 but with a time of\nrest equivalent to two atoms of time. We may infer that speed can also\nvary if a goes from p1 to another place p3\nthat is not directly contiguous with p1.\n\nAlthough Crathorn does not describe himself this way, he seems to be\none of the most radical atomists of the fourteenth century (Robert\n2010a), sharing with his Parisian contemporary Nicholas of Autrecourt\nmuch of the same anti-Aristotelian bent in his metaphysics and natural\nphilosophy. Combined with his epistemology and philosophy of language,\nhis philosophy is certainly one of the most original forms of\nreductionism in later medieval philosophy.\n",
