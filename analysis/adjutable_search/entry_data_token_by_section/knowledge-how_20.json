    "main_text": "Varieties of Anti-Intellectualism || Revisionary Intellectualism\n8.1 Revisionary Intellectualism\n\nAccording to orthodox intellectualism, knowledge-how is a species of\npropositional knowledge. Revisionary intellectualism, instead,\ncontends that although knowledge-how is a kind of knowledge-that, the\nrelevant knowledge is sui generis and differs from standard\npropositional knowledge in some important ways. For example, Brogaard\n(2009, 2011) argues that, in general, knowledge can have cognitive\nabilities or practical abilities as its justificatory grounds. In the\nlatter case, agents know in virtue of ability states that are not\nsubject to the usual epistemic constraints that characterize belief\nstates generated by cognitive abilities. Correspondingly,\nknowledge-how fits the bill for this practically grounded knowledge.\nCath (2015b) argues that we should distinguish between\ntheoretical knowledge-that and practical\nknowledge-that. The former is subject to the usual epistemic\nconstraints, like being sensitive to Gettierization (cf. also Zardini\n2013). The latter, instead, is not sensitive to the usual epistemic\nconstraints of theoretical knowledge-that\u2014and can therefore\nconstitute knowledge-that even if Gettierized. Waights Hickman (2019)\nsuggests that knowledge-how is a distinct kind of knowledge-that\nrelation, characterized by knowing something in \u201cthe executive\nway\u201d, which requires \n\n\npossession of (a) dispositions to attend to features of an\naction-context on which one\u2019s knowledge (how) bears; and (b)\ndispositions to adjust one\u2019s use of that knowledge accordingly.\n(2019: 333).\n\n\nAs we have seen\n (section 4),\n Bengson & Moffett (2007, 2011b) defend Non-propositional (or\nObjectualist) Intellectualism. On this view, knowing how to \u03a6\nnecessarily involves having objectual knowledge of a way of\n\u03a6-ing but having objectual knowledge of a way of \u03a6-ing is not\nsufficient to know how to \u03a6. For example, a tropical swimmer may\nbe acquainted with a way of escaping an avalanche, namely making\nswimming motions. Yet, if this swimmer had no conception whatsoever of\nan avalanche or of snow, he would not know how to escape an avalanche.\nThis suggests that there must be some propositional/representational\naspect of knowing how to \u03a6. Hence, according to this view for one\nto know how to \u03a6, (i) one must have objectual knowledge of a way\nof \u03a6-ing and (ii) one must grasp a correct and complete conception\nof this way.\n",
