    "main_text": "Game Theory and Behavioral Evidence || Game Theory in the Laboratory\n8.1 Game Theory in the Laboratory\n\nEconomists have been testing theories by running laboratory\nexperiments with human and other animal subjects since pioneering work\nby\n Thurstone (1931).\n In recent decades, the volume of such work has become gigantic. The\nvast majority of it sets subjects in microeconomic problem\nenvironments that are imperfectly competitive. Since this is precisely\nthe condition in which microeconomics collapses into game theory, most\nexperimental economics has been experimental game theory. It is thus\ndifficult to distinguish between experimentally motivated questions\nabout the empirical adequacy of microeconomic theory and questions\nabout the empirical adequacy of game theory.\n\nWe can here give only a broad overview of an enormous and complicated\nliterature. Readers are referred to critical surveys in\n Kagel and Roth (1995),\n Camerer (2003),\n Samuelson (2005),\n and the methodological review by\n Guala (2005).\n A useful high-level principle for sorting the literature indexes it\nto the different auxiliary assumptions with which game-theoretic\naxioms are applied. It is often said in popular presentations (e.g.,\n Ormerod 1994)\n that the experimental data generally refute the hypothesis that\npeople are rational economic agents. Such claims are too imprecise to\nbe sustainable interpretations of the results. All data are consistent\nwith the view that people are approximate economic agents, at\nleast for stretches of time long enough to permit game-theoretic\nanalysis of particular scenarios, in the minimal sense that their\nbehavior can be modeled compatibly with Revealed Preference Theory\n(see\n Section 2.1).\n However, RPT makes so little in the way of empirical demands that\nthis is not nearly as surprising as many non-economists suppose\n (Ross 2005a).\n What is really at issue in many of the debates around the general\ninterpretation of experimental evidence is the extent to which people\nare maximizers of expected utility. As we saw in\n Section 3,\n expected utility theory (EUT) is generally applied in tandem with\ngame theory in order to model situations involving\nuncertainty\u2014which is to say, most situations of interest in\nbehavioral science. However, a variety of alternative structural\nmodels of utility lend themselves to Von Neumann-Morgenstern\ncardinalization of preferences and are definable in terms of subsets\nof the\n Savage (1954)\n axioms of subjective utility. The empirical usefulness of game theory\nwould be called into question only if we thought that people\u2019s\nbehavior is not generally describable by means of cardinal vNMufs.\n\nWhat the experimental literature truly appears to show is a world of\nbehavior that is usually noisy from the theorist\u2019s point of\nview. The noise in question arises from substantial heterogeneity,\nboth among people and among (person, situation) vectors. There is no\nsingle structural utility function such that all people act so as to\nmaximize a function of that structure in all circumstances. Faced with\nwell-learned problems in contexts that are not unduly demanding, or\nthat are highly institutionally structured people often behave like\nexpected utility maximizers. For general reviews of theoretical issues\nand evidence, see\n Smith (2008)\n and\n Binmore (2007).\n For an extended sequence of examples of empirical studies, see the\nso-called \u2018continuous double auction\u2019 experiments\ndiscussed in\n Plott and Smith 1978\n and Smith\n 1962,\n 1964,\n 1965,\n 1976,\n 1982.\n As a result, classical game theory can be used in such domains with\nhigh reliability to predict behavior and implement public policy, as\nis demonstrated by the dozens of extremely successful government\nauctions of utilities and other assets designed by game theorists to\nincrease public revenue\n (Binmore and Klemperer 2002).\n\nIn other contexts, interpreting people\u2019s behavior as\ngenerally expected-utility maximizing requires undue violence\nto the need for generality in theory construction. We get better\nprediction using fewer case-specific restrictions if we suppose that\nsubjects are maximizing according to one or (typically) more\nof several alternatives (which will not be described here because they\nare not directly about game theory): rank-dependent utility theory\n (Quiggin 1982,\n Yaari 1987), or alpha-nu utility theory\n (Chew and MacCrimmon 1979).\n The first alternative in fact denotes a family of alternative\nspecifications. One of these, the specification of\n Prelec (1998),\n has emerged in an accumulating mass of empirical estimations as the\nstatistically most useful model of observed human choice under risk\nand uncertainty.\n Harrison and Rutstrom (2008)\n show how to design and code maximum likelihood mixture\nmodels, which allow an empirical modeler to apply a range of\nthese decision functions to a single set of choice data. The resulting\nanalysis identifies the proportion of the total choice set best\nexplained by each model in the mixture.\n Andersen et al (2014)\n take this approach to the current state of the art, demonstrating the\nempirical value of including a model of non-maximizing psychological\nprocesses in a mixture along with maximizing economic models. This\neffective flexibility with respect to the decision modeling that can\nbe deployed in empirical applications of game theory relieves most\npressure to seek adjustments in the game theoretic structures\nthemselves. Thus it fits well with the interpretation of game theory\nas part of the behavioral scientist\u2019s mathematical toolkit,\nrather than as a first-order empirical model of human psychology.\n\nA more serious threat to the usefulness of game theory is evidence of\nsystematic reversal of preferences, in both humans and other animals.\nThis is more serious both because it extends beyond the human case,\nand because it challenges Revealed Preference Theory (RPT) rather than\njust unnecessarily rigid commitment to EUT. As explained in\n Section 2.1,\n RPT, unlike EUT, is among the axiomatic foundations of game theory\ninterpreted non-psychologically. (Not all writers agree that apparent\npreference reversal phenomena threaten RPT rather than EUT; but see\nthe discussions in\n Camerer (1995),\n pp. 660\u2013665, and\n Ross (2005a),\n pp. 177\u2013181.) A basis for preference reversals that seems to be\ncommon in animals with brains is hyperbolic discounting of the\nfuture\n (Strotz 1956,\n Ainslie 1992). This is the phenomenon whereby agents discount future\nrewards more steeply in close temporal distances from the current\nreference point than at more remote temporal distances. This is best\nunderstood by contrast with the idea found in most traditional\neconomic models of exponential discounting, in which there is\na linear relationship between the rate of change in the distance to a\npayoff and the rate at which the value of the payoff from the\nreference point declines. The figure below shows exponential and\nhyperbolic curves for the same interval from a reference point to a\nfuture payoff. The bottom one graphs the hyperbolic function; the\nbowed shape results from the change in the rate of discounting.\n\n\n\nFigure 15\n\n\nA result of this is that, as later prospects come closer to the point\nof possible consumption, people and other animals will sometimes spend\nresources undoing the consequences of previous actions that also cost\nthem resources. For example: deciding today whether to mark a pile of\nundergraduate essays or watch a baseball game, I procrastinate,\ndespite knowing that by doing so I put out of reach some even more fun\npossibility that might come up for tomorrow (when there\u2019s an\nequally attractive ball game on if the better option doesn\u2019t\narise). So far, this can be accounted for in a way that preserves\nconsistency of preferences: if the world might end tonight, with a\ntiny but nonzero probability, then there\u2019s some level of risk\naversion at which I\u2019d rather leave the essays unmarked. The\nfigure below compares two exponential discount curves, the lower one\nfor the value of the game I watch before finishing my marking, and the\nhigher one for the more valuable game I enjoy after completing the\njob. Both have higher value from the reference point the closer they\nare to it; but the curves do not cross, so my revealed preferences are\nconsistent over time no matter how impatient I might be.\n\n\n\nFigure 16\n\n\nHowever, if I bind myself against procrastination by buying a ticket\nfor tomorrow\u2019s game, when in the absence of the awful task I\nwouldn\u2019t have done so, then I\u2019ve violated intertemporal\npreference consistency. More vividly, had I been in a position to\nchoose last week whether to procrastinate today, I\u2019d have chosen\nnot to. In this case, my discount curve drawn from the reference point\nof last week crosses the curve drawn from the perspective of today,\nand my preferences reverse. The figure below shows this situation.\n\n\n\nFigure 17\n\n\nThis phenomenon complicates applications of classical game theory to\nintelligent animals. However, it clearly doesn\u2019t vitiate it\naltogether, since people (and other animals) often\ndon\u2019t reverse their preferences. (If this weren\u2019t\ntrue, the successful auction models and other s-called\n\u2018mechanism designs\u2019 would be mysterious.) Interestingly,\nthe leading theories that aim to explain why hyperbolic discounters\nmight often behave in accordance with RPT themselves appeal to game\ntheoretic principles.\n Ainslie (1992,\n 2001) has produced an account of people as communities of\ninternal bargaining interests, in which subunits based on short-term,\nmedium-term and long-term interests face conflict that they must\nresolve because if they don\u2019t, and instead generate an internal\nHobbesian breakdown\n (Section 1),\n outside agents who avoid the Hobbesian outcome can ruin them all. The\ndevice of the Hobbesian tyrant is unavailable to the brain. Therefore,\nits behavior (when system-level insanity is avoided) is a sequence of\nself-enforcing equilibria of the sort studied by game-theoretic public\nchoice literature on coalitional bargaining in democratic\nlegislatures. That is, the internal politics of the brain consists in\n\u2018logrolling\u2019\n (Stratmann 1997).\n These internal dynamics are then partly regulated and stabilized by\nthe wider social games in which coalitions (people as wholes over\ntemporal subparts of their biographies) are embedded\n (Ross 2005a ,\n pp. 334\u2013353). (For example: social expectations about\nsomeone\u2019s role as a salesperson set behavioral equilibrium\ntargets for the logrolling processes in their brain.) This potentially\nadds further relevant elements to the explanation of why and how\nstable institutions with relatively transparent rules are key\nconditions that help people more closely resemble straightforward\neconomic agents, such that classical game theory finds reliable\napplication to them as entire units.\n\nOne important note of caution is in order here. Much of the recent\nbehavioral literature takes for granted that temporally inconsistent\ndiscounting is the standard or default case for people. However,\n Andersen et al (2008)\n show empirically that this arises from (i) assuming that groups of\npeople are homogenous with respect to which functional forms best\ndescribe their discounting behavior, and (ii) failure to independently\nelicit and control for people\u2019s differing levels of risk\naversion in estimating their discount functions. In a range of\npopulations that have been studied with these two considerations in\nmind, data suggest that temporally consistent discounting describes\nsubstantially higher proportions of choices than does temporally\ninconsistent choices. Over-generalization of hyperbolic discounting\nmodels should thus be avoided. \n",
