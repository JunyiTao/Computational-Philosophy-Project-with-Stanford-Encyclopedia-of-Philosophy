    "main_text": "The neo-classical theories of truth || The coherence theory\n1.2 The coherence theory\n\nThough initially the correspondence theory was seen by its developers\nas a competitor to the identity theory of truth, it was also\nunderstood as opposed to the coherence theory of truth.\n\nWe will be much briefer with the historical origins of the coherence\ntheory than we were with the correspondence theory. Like the\ncorrespondence theory, versions of the coherence theory can be seen\nthroughout the history of philosophy. (See, for instance, Walker\n(1989) for a discussion of its early modern lineage.) Like the\ncorrespondence theory, it was important in the early 20th century\nBritish origins of analytic philosophy. Particularly, the coherence\ntheory of truth is associated with the British idealists to whom Moore\nand Russell were reacting.\n\nMany idealists at that time did indeed hold coherence theories. Let us\ntake as an example Joachim (1906). (This is the theory that Russell\n(1910a) attacks.) Joachim says that:\n\nTruth in its essential nature is that systematic coherence which is\nthe character of a significant whole (p. 76).\n\n\nWe will not attempt a full exposition of Joachim\u2019s view, which\nwould take us well beyond the discussion of truth into the details of\nBritish idealism. But a few remarks about his theory will help to give\nsubstance to the quoted passage.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Joachim talks of \u2018truth\u2019 in the\nsingular. This is not merely a turn of phrase, but a reflection of his\nmonistic idealism. Joachim insists that what is true is the\n\u201cwhole complete truth\u201d (p. 90). Individual judgments or\nbeliefs are certainly not the whole complete truth. Such judgments\nare, according to Joachim, only true to a degree. One aspect of this\ndoctrine is a kind of holism about content, which holds that any\nindividual belief or judgment gets its content only in virtue of being\npart of a system of judgments. But even these systems are only true to\na degree, measuring the extent to which they express the content of\nthe single \u2018whole complete truth\u2019. Any real judgment we\nmight make will only be partially true.\n\nTo flesh out Joachim\u2019s theory, we would have to explain what a\nsignificant whole is. We will not attempt that, as it leads us to some\nof the more formidable aspects of his view, e.g., that it is a\n\u201cprocess of self-fulfillment\u201d (p. 77). But it is clear\nthat Joachim takes \u2018systematic coherence\u2019 to be stronger\nthan consistency. In keeping with his holism about content, he rejects\nthe idea that coherence is a relation between independently identified\ncontents, and so finds it necessary to appeal to \u2018significant\nwholes\u2019.\n\nAs with the correspondence theory, it will be useful to recast the\ncoherence theory in a more modern form, which will abstract away from\nsome of the difficult features of British idealism. As with the\ncorrespondence theory, it can be put in a slogan:\n\nA belief is true if and only if it is part of a coherent system of\nbeliefs.\n\n\nTo further the contrast with the neo-classical correspondence theory,\nwe may add that a proposition is true if it is the content of a belief\nin the system, or entailed by a belief in the system. We may assume,\nwith Joachim, that the condition of coherence will be stronger than\nconsistency. With the idealists generally, we might suppose that\nfeatures of the believing subject will come into play. \n\nThis theory is offered as an analysis of the nature of truth, and not\nsimply a test or criterion for truth. Put as such, it is clearly not\nJoachim\u2019s theory (it lacks his monism, and he rejects\npropositions), but it is a standard take on coherence in the\ncontemporary literature. (It is the way the coherence theory is given\nin Walker (1989), for instance. See also Young (2001) for a recent\ndefense of a coherence theory.) Let us take this as our neo-classical\nversion of the coherence theory. The contrast with the correspondence\ntheory of truth is clear. Far from being a matter of whether the world\nprovides a suitable object to mirror a proposition, truth is a matter\nof how beliefs are related to each-other.\n\nThe coherence theory of truth enjoys two sorts of motivations. One is\nprimarily epistemological. Most coherence theorists also hold a\ncoherence theory of knowledge; more specifically, a coherence theory\nof justification. According to this theory, to be justified is to be\npart of a coherent system of beliefs. An argument for this is often\nbased on the claim that only another belief could stand in a\njustification relation to a belief, allowing nothing but properties of\nsystems of belief, including coherence, to be conditions for\njustification. Combining this with the thesis that a fully justified\nbelief is true forms an argument for the coherence theory of truth.\n(An argument along these lines is found in Blanshard (1939), who holds\na form of the coherence theory closely related to\nJoachim\u2019s.)\n\nThe steps in this argument may be questioned by a number of\ncontemporary epistemological views. But the coherence theory also goes\nhand-in-hand with its own metaphysics as well. The coherence theory is\ntypically associated with idealism. As we have already discussed,\nforms of it were held by British idealists such as Joachim, and later\nby Blanshard (in America). An idealist should see the last step in the\njustification argument as quite natural. More generally, an idealist\nwill see little (if any) room between a system of beliefs and the\nworld it is about, leaving the coherence theory of truth as an\nextremely natural option.\n\nIt is possible to be an idealist without adopting a coherence theory.\n(For instance, many scholars read Bradley as holding a version of the\nidentity theory of truth. See Baldwin (1991) for some discussion.)\nHowever, it is hard to see much of a way to hold the coherence theory\nof truth without maintaining some form of idealism. If there is\nnothing to truth beyond what is to be found in an appropriate system\nof beliefs, then it would seem one\u2019s beliefs constitute the\nworld in a way that amounts to idealism. (Walker (1989) argues that\nevery coherence theorist must be an idealist, but not vice-versa.)\n\nThe neo-classical correspondence theory seeks to capture the intuition\nthat truth is a content-to-world relation. It captures this in the\nmost straightforward way, by asking for an object in the world to pair\nup with a true proposition. The neo-classical coherence theory, in\ncontrast, insists that truth is not a content-to-world relation at\nall; rather, it is a content-to-content, or belief-to-belief,\nrelation. The coherence theory requires some metaphysics which can\nmake the world somehow reflect this, and idealism appears to be it. (A\ndistant descendant of the neo-classical coherence theory that does not\nrequire idealism will be discussed in section 6.5 below.)\n\nFor more on the coherence theory, see Walker (2018) and the entry on\nthe\n coherence theory of truth.\n",
