    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nMichel Henry was born on January 10, 1922 in Haiphong, Vietnam (then,\nFrench Indochina). After the accidental death of his father, the\nfamily returned to Paris in 1929. In Paris, Henry became a student at\nthe prestigious Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV, then graduated with a Master\nthesis on Spinoza in 1943 with Jean Grenier as director. Soon after\nhaving turned in his thesis, partially published in the Revue\nd\u2019histoire de la philosophie et d\u2019histoire\ng\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la civilisation in 1944 and 1946, Henry\njoined the French Resistance and was assigned to the\n\u201cPericles\u201d division in the region of Haut Jura. He\nreturned to Paris at the end of 1944, obtaining the\nAgr\u00e9gation in philosophy in 1945. As a researcher at\nthe French National Research Center CNRS and the Fondation\nThiers, he began working under the supervision of both Jean Wahl\nand Jean Hyppolite on his Ph.D. thesis, which would be published in\n1963 and become one of his major works: The Essence of\nManifestation. His second book, Philosophy and Phenomenology\nof the Body, although published two years later, was already\nfinished around 1950, having first been planned as a part of the main\nthesis but, due to its length, was presented as Henry\u2019s\nsecondary thesis (a requirement in the French academic system at that\ntime). In 1963, the dissertation committee, composed of Jean Wahl,\nJean Hyppolite, Ferdinand Alqui\u00e9, Paul Ricoeur, and Henri\nGouhier, was impressed by Henry\u2019s main Ph.D. thesis, a work that\ntranslates almost a decade of research into more than 900 pages of\ncomplex philosophical argument. Preferring a position in southern\nFrance to one at the Sorbonne, Henry had already been appointed to the University\nof Montpellier in 1960 where he remained a professor until his\nretirement in 1982. He devoted his entire philosophical career to the\ndevelopment of his phenomenology of life with, among other\npublications, Marx (1976), Genealogy of\nPsychoanalysis (1985), Seeing the Invisible (1988),\nMaterial Phenomenology (1990), I Am the Truth\n(1996), Incarnation (2000). In addition, he authored four\nnovels, one of which\u2014L\u2019amour les yeux\nferm\u00e9s\u2014was awarded the Prix Renaudot in\n1976. He died on July 3, 2002 in Albi, France. \n",
