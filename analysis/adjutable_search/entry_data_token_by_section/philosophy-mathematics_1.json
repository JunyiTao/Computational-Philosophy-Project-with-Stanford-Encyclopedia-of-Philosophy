    "main_text": "Four schools\n2. Four schools\n\nThe general philosophical and scientific outlook in the nineteenth\ncentury tended toward the empirical: platonistic aspects of\nrationalistic theories of mathematics were rapidly losing support.\nEspecially the once highly praised faculty of rational intuition of\nideas was regarded with suspicion. Thus it became a challenge to\nformulate a philosophical theory of mathematics that was free of\nplatonistic elements. In the first decades of the twentieth century,\nthree non-platonistic accounts of mathematics were developed:\nlogicism, formalism, and intuitionism. There emerged in the beginning\nof the twentieth century also a fourth program: predicativism. Due to\ncontingent historical circumstances, its true potential was not\nbrought out until the 1960s. However it deserves a place beside the\nthree traditional schools that are discussed in most standard\ncontemporary introductions to philosophy of mathematics, such as\n(Shapiro 2000) and (Linnebo 2017).\n",
