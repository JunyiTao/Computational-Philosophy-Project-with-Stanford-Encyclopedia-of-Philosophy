    "main_text": "\n\nIn the early years of the twentieth century, Gottlob Frege and David\nHilbert, two titans of mathematical logic, engaged in a controversy\nregarding the correct understanding of the role of axioms in\nmathematical theories, and the correct way to demonstrate consistency\nand independence results for such axioms. The controversy touches on a\nnumber of difficult questions in logic and the philosophy of logic,\nand marks an important turning-point in the development of modern\nlogic. This entry gives an overview of that controversy and of its\nphilosophical underpinnings.\n",
