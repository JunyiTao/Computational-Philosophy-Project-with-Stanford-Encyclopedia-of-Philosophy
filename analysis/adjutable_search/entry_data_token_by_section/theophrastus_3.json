    "main_text": "Psychology\n4. Psychology\n\nTheophrastus is reported to have written a treatise with the title\nOn the Soul, which was a commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nOn the Soul and comprised at least two books. Nearly all we\nknow about this Theophrastean work comes from Themistius\u2019\nparaphrase of Aristotle\u2019s On the Soul, which was used\nheavily in Arabic philosophical writings, as well as from Priscian of\nLydia\u2019s paraphrase of Theophrastus\u2019 work. In this\ntreatise, just like in his Metaphysics, Theophrastus pointed\nout difficulties in Aristotle\u2019s text, suggested conceptual\ndistinctions and clarified the implications of obscure Aristotelian\ndoctrines like, for instance, the definition of perception as\nassimilation of the sensible form of an object without its matter (see\nLaks 2002, 2019; Caston 2019). It is debatable, however, whether\nTheophrastus also offered clear and unambiguous solutions to the\nproblems he raised.\n\nIn particular, it has been proposed that his questions and remarks\nconcerning Aristotle\u2019s theory of the intellect do not pose\nserious challenges (frs. 307\u2013327 FHS&G). Theophrastus\naccepted the basic Aristotelian assumptions and simply tried to\nelucidate the opaque statements in Aristotle\u2019s On the\nSoul 2.5\u20133.5. For instance, he raised the issue of how the\nintellect differs from matter; how the descriptions of the intellect\nas passive and as productive can both be true of one and the same\nentity; whether the passive intellect is actualized by the\nintelligibles or by the productive intellect; what the relation is\nbetween the intellect and the intelligibles; why is it that the\nintellect sometimes thinks and sometimes does not. Every question\nraised in this treatise receives an answer, or at least a suggestion\nof an answer. For instance, Theophrastus replied that while matter\nreceives individual forms, intellect receives universal forms. As to\nhis suggestion concerning the relation between the passive and the\nproductive intellect, different interpretations have been offered; it\nhas been argued that Theophrastus treated them both as immanent parts\nof the soul, but it has also been argued that he thought of the\nproductive intellect as a transcendent separate entity. Also, he seems\nto have claimed that the productive intellect is the principle of\nthought, not by operating directly on the passive intellect but by\nactualizing the intelligibles, and thus by enabling them to affect the\npassive intellect; in this way, the productive intellect is\nresponsible for thought just like light, which actualizes colours and\nrenders them perceptible, is responsible for vision. All such\nTheophrastean suggestions, however, were most probably not intended as\ndiversions from nor as developments of Aristotle\u2019s views, but\nrather as reformulations and clarifications of the Aristotelian\ndoctrine (see Barbotin 1954; Devereux 1992; Magrin 2011).\n\nIn addition, we are fortunate to have some information about\nTheophrastus\u2019 theory of knowledge, mainly thanks to a passage in\nSextus Empiricus\u2019 Against the Logicians, in which\nSextus presents the different views of preceding philosophers on the\ncriterion of truth (fr. 301A FHS&G). There are many ambiguous\nstatements in this passage, but it clearly ascribes to Theophrastus\nthe view that sensation (aisth\u0113sis) and thought\n(no\u0113sis) are the sources of knowledge, while\nself-evidence (to enarges) is the basic criterion for both.\nSo, Theophrastus is said to have claimed that our senses are moved by\nthe sense object and, when the sensation is self-evident, a reliable\nmemory of the sensation and an appearance or an imagination\n(phantasia) of the sense object follow; for instance, the\nmemory and the phantasia of Socrates existing in the minds of\nthose who knew him directly. A third movement is added, namely\nrational phantasia, which results from our judgement and\nchoice, and which involves the production of a model by the\naggregation of individuals in the universal, for instance the rational\nphantasia of man; hence, rational phantasia\nconstitutes, with regard to being potential, understanding\n(dianoia) and, with regard to being actual, intellect\n(nous). Finally, from understanding and intellect concepts\narise, and thus knowledge (epist\u0113m\u0113) and skill\n(techn\u0113). Sextus\u2019 passage has been used as\nevidence for the interpretation, according to which Theophrastus\nmanaged to sort out an ambiguity in Aristotle\u2019s use of the term\nphantasia, by distinguishing the rational phantasia,\nwhich is tied up with speech and reason, from the formation of the\nphantasia, which is nothing but a by-phenomenon of sensation\n(see Huby 1989).\n\nThe other Theophrastean treatise in psychology has the title On\nthe Senses or On Sensations (peri\naisth\u0113se\u014dn). This work survived for the most part\nintact and was edited by Hermann Diels, in his Doxographi\nGraeci (1879), as part of Theophrastus\u2019 Opinions of the\nNatural Philosophers or Opinions in Natural Philosophy;\nit was, therefore, treated as a mere source for the physical doctrines\nof previous philosophers and considered as the origin of the rest of\nthe doxographic tradition. It is rather recently that scholars have\neventually recognized it as an independent work, whose study would\nprobably benefit from a new critical edition (see McDiarmid 1962;\nBaltussen 2019; Mansfeld 2019). More specifically, On the\nSenses or On Sensations deals with the theories of sense\nperception put forward by Parmenides, Empedocles, Alcmaeon,\nAnaxagoras, Cleidemus, Diogenes of Apollonia, Plato and Democritus. It\npresents and criticizes the views of these philosophers about the\nsenses and their objects, among which vision and colour occupy a\ncentral place; it also discusses pain and pleasure, as well as the\nphysiology of thought. Theophrastus applied throughout this work the\nmethod of division: The first and main division, already found in\nAristotle, is between those who believe sense perception to be by\nsimilarity, i.e., in accordance with the principle \u201clike by\nlike\u201d, and those who assume it is through contrast. But another\ndivision that is not Aristotelian also plays a part, namely between\nthose who believe that sense perception differs from thought, and\nthose who do not. The last philosopher whom this treatise discusses is\nDemocritus and not Plato, because Democritus argued, in\nTheophrastus\u2019 view, both that sense perception is by like and\nthat it is by unlike, and so failed to fit the main division (see\nMansfeld 1996; Johansen 2019).\n\nTheophrastus\u2019 reconstruction of previous theories has been at\nthe centre of the scholarly discussion on this work. Detailed studies\nconcerning the way he summarized preceding opinions have been written,\nand it has been interestingly suggested that he often proves to have\nbeen more reliable and careful than Aristotle in expounding accurately\nwhat each one of his predecessors advocated (see McDiarmid 1959a,\n1959b, 1960; Sedley 1985, 1992; Sharples 1985b; Laks 1990; Long 1996;\nBredlow 2011; van Raalte 2015; Ierodiakonou 2019b; Rudolph 2019). In\naddition, more attention has lately been given to Theophrastus\u2019\nown analysis of earlier arguments as well as to his critical\nevaluations, so that this treatise is no longer thought of as a mere\nreport of past doctrines but rather as a document of Peripatetic\ndialectic (see Baltussen 2000).\n",
