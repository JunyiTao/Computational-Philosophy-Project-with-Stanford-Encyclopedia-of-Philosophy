    "main_text": "Moral Rights and Side-Constraints || The Attenuation of Rights\n2.4 The Attenuation of Rights\n\nNozick\u2019s account of rights takes a surprising turn in his very\ncomplex chapter 4 on \u201cProhibition, Compensation, and Risk\u201d\n(Mack 1981). Employing the language of rights as moral boundaries,\nNozick asks whether all actions that cross boundaries may be\nprohibited, i.e., may permissibly be\n punished.[11]\n His unexpected answer is that not all boundary crossings may be\nprohibited. Some boundary crossings are to be allowed\u2014without\nthe consent of those subject to them\u2014as long as due compensation\nis paid to those subjects. Nozick\u2019s presumption within this\nchapter is that it does not follow from\nB\u2019s having a right against A to\nA\u2019s not inflicting treatment T on B\nthat A\u2019s inflicting T on A may be\nprohibited (59). All that follows from B\u2019s\nhaving that right is that A may not inflict T on\nB unless A also duly compensates\n B.[12]\n All that follows is that B has a claim against\nA that A\u2019s infliction of T on\nB not leave B\u2019s utility or welfare on net\ndiminished.\n\nWe can describe Nozick\u2019s position here by utilizing the now\ncommon distinction between claims that are protected by property rules\nand claims that are protected by liability rules (338n6). One\u2019s\nclaim with respect to some object O is protected by a\nproperty rule if one must be allowed to do as one sees fit with\nO\u2014as long as one abides by the applicable side\nconstraints. Others may not deprive one of one\u2019s choice with\nrespect to O\u2014even if they also compensate one for the\nutility or welfare loss of being precluded from doing as one sees fit\nwith O. In contrast, one\u2019s claim with respect to\nO is merely protected by a liability rule if others may\ndetermine (without one\u2019s consent) what is done with O\nas long as they duly compensate one for the associated utility or\nwelfare loss. In chapter 4, Nozick\u2019s presumption seems to be\nthat all that follows from one\u2019s having a right is that\none has a claim that is protected by a liability rule.\n\nOf course, it may be impossible or severely difficult for A\nto duly compensate B for inflicting treatment\nT\u2014as when T consists in killing B.\nMoreover, if it is impossible or severely difficult for A to\nduly compensate B for a given boundary crossing, A\nmust not cross that boundary without B\u2019s consent. The\nconjunction of the liability rule claim and the impossibility\nor difficulty of due compensation yields (the equivalent of) a\nproperty rule claim for B against A\u2019s imposing\nT on B. The further conditions that render due\ncompensation impossible or difficult boost what would otherwise merely\nbe a liability rule claim against being subject to T into\n(the equivalent of) a property rule claim against being subject to\nT. As we see in the next section, Nozick thinks that such\nboosting conditions are pervasive. So, one of the things that Nozick\nis suggesting in his intricate chapter 4 is that, even the\nseparateness of persons in itself only underwrites claims protected by\nliability rules, those claims need to be treated as though they are\nprotected by property rules whenever due compensation for infringing\nupon them would be impossible or not feasible.\n\nPerhaps, we ought not to be too surprised by Nozick\u2019s chapter 4\npresumption that in themselves rights are merely claims that are\nprotected by liability rules. For recall the crucial role ascribed to\nnatural rights within Nozick\u2019s separateness of persons argument.\nThat role is to provide individuals with moral protection against\nhaving sacrifices (i.e., net losses) imposed upon them. All that\nrights must do in order to play this role is to require that\nall boundary-crossings be accompanied by due compensation (and that\nthey not be done if the provision of due accompanying compensation is\nnot feasible).\n\nHowever, Nozick\u2019s focus on rights having the role of protecting\nindividuals from net losses being imposed upon them raised concerns\nfor him about whether invocations of rights would deliver the strong\nanti-paternalism that he\n favored.[13]\n If rights are in themselves merely claims against having one\u2019s\nutility or welfare on net lowered by certain interferences, then one\nwill have no right against interferences that on net raise one\u2019s\nutility or welfare. Arguments that \u201cwill prohibit sacrificing\none person to benefit another\u201d will not themselves deliver\n\u201ca prohibition on paternalist aggression\u201d (34). Rights\nagainst paternalist interventions that really do serve interests of\nthe paternalized party must protect the choices of that\nparty\u2014even choices that will lower her utility or welfare.\n\nMoreover, the view that rights in themselves are claims protected by\nliability rules does not comport well with the overall tone of\nAnarchy, State, and Utopia. Nozick does not begin this work\nby declaring that there are things that may not be done to individuals\nunless, of course, they are duly compensated. Nor does the\nliability rule construal of rights fit well with Nozick\u2019s\naffirmation of the inviolability of individuals, the Kantian claim\nthat individuals \u201cmay not be sacrificed or used for the\nachieving of other ends without their consent\u201d (31,\nemphasis added), or the moral sovereignty of individuals (34). Indeed,\nat one point Nozick himself says that \u201ca system permitting\nboundary crossing, provided compensation is paid, embodies the use\nof persons as means\u2026\u201d (71, emphasis added). It\nembodies the use of persons as means because it allows such use as\nlong as the utility or welfare of the used party is not on net\ndiminished. The provision of due compensation may counteract the\nimposed loss of utility or welfare; but it does not counteract the\nwrong of the use.\n\nIn the next section, we shall focus on Nozick\u2019s use of this\nliability rule attenuation of rights in his response to the anarchist.\nWe should note, however, that after disposing of the anarchist Nozick\nreverts to the more robust property rule understanding of rights.\nThus, in chapter 7, on \u201cDistributive Justice\u201d, Nozick says\nthat,\n\n\nThe central core of the notion of a property rights in X\n\u2026 is the right to determine what shall be done with X,\nthe right to choose which of the constrained set of options concerning\nX shall be realized or attempted. (171)\n\n\nTo have a right in X is to have a claim protected by a\nproperty rule. Others\u2019 interference with one\u2019s doing as\none sees fit with X is impermissible\u2014even if one is\nduly compensated for imposed utility or welfare losses. And Nozick\ngoes on to extend this property rule construal to people\u2019s\nrights in themselves and their labor.\n\n\nThis notion of property helps us understand why earlier theorists\nspoke of people as having property in themselves and their labor. They\nviewed each person as having a right to decide what would become of\nhimself and what he would do\u2026 (171)\n\n\nIndeed, in chapter 7, Nozick argues that seizing the fruits of a\nperson\u2019s labor is impermissible because this involves taking the\ntime that this person devoted to this labor without that\nperson\u2019s consent. There is no hint that the taking of that time\nwithout that party\u2019s consent would be permissible if only that\nparty were duly compensated. There is no hint that the requirement\nthat this individual consent to any taking depends upon due\ncompensation for such a taking being impossible or severely\ndifficult.\n\nWe should also note that this passage about earlier theorists speaking\nof people as having property in themselves is the closest Nozick ever\ncomes to formulating his own position in terms of a doctrine of\nself-ownership. Contrary to common presentations of\nNozick\u2019s doctrine, there is no mention of self-ownership within\nhis Part I discussion of state of nature\n theory.[14]\n Throughout Part I, Nozick is content to have his readers fill in the\ncontent of moral side constraints by drawing on their intuitions that,\nif there are any moral side constraints, they must include constraints\nagainst (unprovoked) killing, assaulting, maiming, enslaving. There\nis, at most, a hint that all of these constraints can be subsumed\nunder a general constraint against aggression (34). (It seems,\nhowever, that aggression itself requires explication on the basis of a\nprior and independent specification of persons\u2019 rights.)\n\nOverall, Nozick maintains that there is something about the\nseparateness of persons\u2014something about the propriety of each\nseeking his own good in his own chosen way\u2014that does not merely\nundermine the view that individuals should sacrifice themselves (and\nothers) for the social good. Beyond that undermining, the separateness\nof persons positively supports each individual\u2019s possession of\nfundamental, broad, natural, and negative moral claims that hold\nagainst all other agents. What Nozick needs is a more clearly\narticulated and persuasive transition from each individual having ends\nof his own that he is rational to pursue (and, hence, there being no\nproper moral balancing across persons) to each individual having a\nmoral status vis-\u00e1-vis others that provides others\nwith reason not to interfere with his chosen pursuits even in ways\nthat would be on net beneficial to that individual. Nozick provides\nmaterial that is suggestive of this transition but certainly not a\ncompelling case for it. Nozick also fails to address the hard question\nof why\u2014except perhaps to avoid \u201ccatastrophic moral\nhorror\u201d (29 footnote*)\u2014rights always trump considerations\nof personal or social well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, it would certainly be unfair to Nozick to insist\nthat there be one or a few core foundationalist arguments on which all\nof the rest of his doctrine firmly rests. It is clear that Nozick\nthinks that the coherence that obtains among the stances he develops\nwithin ASU enhances the plausibility of each of those\nstances. For instance, while his historical entitlement theory of\njustice in holdings is largely grounded in his critique of alternative\nconceptions of economic justice, Nozick takes the coherence between\nthis theory with his affirmation of basic moral side constraints to\nincrease the plausibility of his doctrine as a whole. Similarly,\nNozick takes the coherence of his rights based defense of the minimal\nstate in Part I of ASU with his less moralistic defense of\nthe minimal state as a framework for utopia in Part III to enhance the\noverall case for the minimal\n state.[15]\n",
