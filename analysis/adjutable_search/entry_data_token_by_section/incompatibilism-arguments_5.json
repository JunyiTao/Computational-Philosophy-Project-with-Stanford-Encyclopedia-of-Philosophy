    "main_text": "Sourcehood Arguments\n5. Choice and the Consequence Argument\n\nWe think that we make choices, and we think that our choices typically\nmake a difference to our future. We think that there is a point to\ndeliberation: how we deliberate\u2014what reasons we\nconsider\u2014makes a difference to what we choose and thus to what\nwe do. We also think that when we deliberate there really is\nmore than one choice we are able to make, more than one action we are\nable to perform, and more than one future which is, at least partly,\nin our power to bring about.\n\nOur beliefs about our powers with respect to the future contrast\nsharply with our beliefs about our lack of power with respect to the\npast. We don\u2019t think we have any choice about the past.\nWe don\u2019t deliberate about the past; we think it irrational to do\nanything aimed at trying to change or affect the past (\u201cYou had\nyour chance; you blew it. It\u2019s too late now to do anything about\nit\u201d). Our beliefs about our options, opportunities,\nalternatives, possibilities, abilities, powers, and so on, are all\nfuture-directed. We may summarize this contrast by saying that we\nthink that the future is \u201copen\u201d in some sense that\ncontrasts with the non-openness or \u201cfixity\u201d of the\npast.\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t think we (now) have a choice about the past,\nwe have beliefs about what was possible for us in the past.\nWhen called upon to defend what we did, or when we blame or reproach\nourselves, or simply wonder whether we did the right thing (or the\nsensible thing, the rational thing, and so on), we evaluate our action\nby comparing it to what we believe were our other possible actions,\nat that time. We blame, criticize, reproach, regret, and so\non, only insofar as we believe we had alternatives. And if we later\ndiscover that we were mistaken in believing that some action \\(X\\) was\namong our alternatives, we think it is irrational to criticize or\nregret our failure to do \\(X\\).\n\nIs determinism compatible with the truth of these beliefs? In\nparticular, is it compatible with the belief that we are often able to\nchoose and do more than one action?\n\nIncompatibilists have traditionally said \u201cNo\u201d. And\nit\u2019s not hard to see why. If we think of \u2018can\u2019 in\nthe \u201copen future\u201d way suggested by the commonsense view,\nthen it\u2019s tempting to think that the past is necessary in some\nabsolute sense. And it\u2019s natural to think that we are able to do\notherwise only if we can do otherwise given this \u201cfixed\u201d\npast; that is, only if our doing otherwise is a possible\ncontinuation of the actual past. If we follow this train of thought,\nwe will conclude that we are able to do otherwise only if our doing\notherwise is a possible continuation of the past consistent with\nthe laws. But if determinism is true, there is only one\npossible continuation of the past consistent with the laws. And thus\nwe get the incompatibilist conclusion. If determinism is true, our\nactual future is our only possible future. What we actually do is the\nonly thing we are able to do.\n\nBut this argument is too quick. It rests on assumptions about the\nnature of time which are arguably at odds with what physics tells us.\n(Hoefer 2003 [2016], Ismael 2016.) There is an alternative explanation\nfor our beliefs about the \u201copen\u201d future as opposed to the\n\u201cfixed\u201d past\u2014the direction of causation. Causes are\nalways earlier than their effects. Our deliberation causes our\nchoices, which cause our actions. But not the other way around. Our\nchoices cause future events; they never cause past events. Why\ncausation works this way is a deep and difficult question, but the\nleading view, among philosophers of science, is that the temporal\nasymmetry of causation is a fundamental but contingent fact about our\nuniverse. If things were different enough\u2014if we could travel\nbackwards in time\u2014then we would sometimes have an ability that\nwe don\u2019t actually have\u2014the ability to causally affect past\npersons and things (Horwich 1987; D. Lewis 1976). If this is right,\nthen we don\u2019t need to suppose that the past is metaphysically or\nabsolutely necessary in order to explain the fixed past/open future\ncontrast. The past could have been different. But, given the\nway things actually are, there is nothing that we are able to do\nthat would causally affect the past.\n\nThis alternative explanation of our commonsense belief about the\ncontrast between fixed past and open future allows the compatibilist\nto say the kind of things that compatibilists have traditionally\nwanted to say: The \u2018can\u2019 of our freedom of will and\nfreedom of action is the \u2018can\u2019 of causal and\ncounterfactual dependence. Our future is open because it depends,\ncausally and counterfactually, on our choices, which in turn depend,\ncausally and counterfactually, on our deliberation and on the reasons\nwe take ourselves to have. (At least in the normal case, where there\nis neither external constraint nor internal compulsion or other\npathology.) If our reasons were different (in some appropriate way),\nwe would choose otherwise, and if we chose otherwise, we would do\notherwise. And our reasons can be different, at least in the\nsense that we, unlike simpler creatures and young children, have the\nability to critically evaluate our reasons (beliefs, desires,\nvalues, principles, and so on) and that we have, and at least\nsometimes exercise, the ability to change our reasons (Bok\n1998; Dennett 1984; Fischer 1994; Fischer & Ravizza 1998;\nFrankfurt 1971, 1988; Lehrer 1976, 1980, 2004; Watson 1975, 1987,\n2004; Wolf 1990; Smith 1997, 2004; Pettit & Smith 1996; Nelkin\n2011; Vihvelin 2004, 2013). All this is compatible with determinism.\nSo the truth of determinism is compatible with the truth of our\ncommonsense belief that we really do have a choice about the future,\nthat we really can choose and do other than what we actually do.\n\nIncompatibilists think that this, and any compatibilist\naccount of the \u2018can\u2019 of freedom of choice, is, and\nmust be, mistaken. The Consequence Argument (Ginet 1966,\n1983, 1990; van Inwagen 1975, 1983, 2000; Wiggins 1973; Lamb 1977) is\nwidely regarded as the best argument for this conclusion. In the\nremainder of this section we will take a closer look at van\nInwagen\u2019s version of this important and influential\nargument.\n\nIn An Essay on Free Will (1983), van Inwagen presents three\nformal arguments which, he says, are intended as three versions of the\nsame basic argument, which he characterized as follows:\n\n\nIf determinism is true, then our acts are the consequence of laws of\nnature and events in the remote past. But it\u2019s not up to us what\nwent on before we were born, and neither is it up to us what the laws\nof nature are. Therefore, the consequences of these things (including\nour present acts) are not up to us. (1983: 56)\n\n\nWe will begin by looking at the third version of the argument (the\nRule Beta argument). The Rule Beta argument uses a modal sentential\noperator which van Inwagen defines as follows:\n\u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}p\\)\u2019 abbreviates \u2018\\(p\\) and no one has,\nor ever had, any choice about whether \\(p\\)\u2019. Van Inwagen tells\nus that the logic of \u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)\u2019 includes these two\ninference rules, where \\(\\Box p\\) asserts that it is logically\nnecessity that \\(p\\):\n\n\nAlpha: From \\(\\Box p\\), we may infer\n\\(\\mathbf{N}p\\).\n\nBeta: From \\(\\mathbf{N}p\\) and \\(\\mathbf{N}(p \\supset\nq)\\), we may infer \\(\\mathbf{N}q\\).\n\n\nIn the argument below, \u2018\\(L\\)\u2019 is an abbreviation for a\nsentence expressing a conjunction of all the laws of nature;\n\u2018\\(H\\)\u2019 is a sentence expressing a true proposition about\nthe total state of the world at some time in the distant past before\nany agents existed; \u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019 is \u2018it is logically\nnecessary that\u2019; \u2018\\(\\supset\\)\u2019 is the material\nconditional, and \u2018\\(P\\)\u2019 is a dummy for which we may\nsubstitute any sentence which expresses a true proposition.\n\nThe argument is a conditional proof: Assume determinism and show that\nit follows that no one has, or ever had, a choice about any\ntrue proposition, including propositions about the apparently free\nactions of human beings.\n\n\n\n1.\n\\(\\Box((H \\amp L) \\supset P)\\)\ndefinition of determinism \n\n2.\n\\(\\Box(H \\supset(L \\supset P)\\)\nfrom 1, by modal and sentential logic \n\n3.\n\\(\\mathbf{N}(H \\supset(L \\supset P))\\)\nfrom 2, by rule Alpha \n\n4.\n\\(\\mathbf{N}H\\)\npremise, fixity of past \n\n5.\n\\(\\mathbf{N}(L \\supset P)\\)\nfrom 3, 4, by rule Beta \n\n6.\n\\(\\mathbf{N}L\\)\npremise, fixity of laws \n\n7.\n\\(\\mathbf{N}P\\)\nfrom 5, 6, by rule Beta  \n\n\nPremises (1) and (2) follow from determinism. (3) follows from (2), by\napplication of rule Alpha. Rule Alpha seems uncontroversial. (But see\nSpencer 2017).\n\nPremises 4 and 6 also look uncontroversial. \\(N\\) necessity\nisn\u2019t logical or metaphysical necessity. We can insist that the\nlaws and the distant past could, in the broadly logical\nsense, have been different, so neither \\(\\Box H\\) nor \\(\\Box L\\) are\ntrue. But it still seems undeniably true that we have no\nchoice about whether the laws and the distant past are the way\nthey are; there is nothing that we are able to do that would\nmake it the case that either the laws or the distant past are\ndifferent from the way they actually are.\n\nRule Beta is the key to the argument. It\u2019s what makes the\ndifference between this version of the Consequence Argument and an\nargument widely agreed to be fallacious.\n\n\n\\(\\Box(P \\supset Q)\\)\n\n\\(P\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\Box Q\\)\n\n\nAn example of this invalid inference is an argument sometimes called\n\u201cthe fatalist fallacy\u201d:\n\n\n\\(\\Box\\)(it\u2019s true that it will rain tomorrow \\(\\supset\\) it\nwill rain tomorrow)\n\nIt\u2019s true that it will rain tomorrow\n\nTherefore, \\(\\Box\\)(it will rain tomorrow)\n\n\nAnother example:\n\n\n\\(\\Box((H \\amp L) \\supset P)\\)\n\n\\(H \\amp L\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\Box P\\)\n\n\nOn the other hand, the following is a valid inference:\n\n\n\\(\\Box P\\)\n\n\\(\\Box(P \\supset Q)\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\Box Q\\)\n\n\nThe necessity expressed by the \u2018no choice about\u2019 operator\nis not logical or metaphysical necessity. But it might nevertheless be\nsimilar enough for Beta to be a valid rule of inference. Or so argued\nvan Inwagen, and gave examples:\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)(The sun explodes in the year 2000)\n\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)(The sun explodes in the year 2000 \\(\\supset\\) All life\non earth ends in the year 2000)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\mathbf{N}\\)(All life on earth ends in the year 2000)\n\n\nAn early response to the Consequence argument was to argue that Beta\nis invalid because a compatibilist account of the ability to do\notherwise is correct (Gallois 1977; Foley 1979; Slote 1982; Flint\n1987). For instance, if \u201c\\(S\\) is able to do \\(X\\)\u201d means\n\u201cif \\(S\\) tried to do \\(X\\), \\(S\\) would do \\(X\\)\u201d, then\nthe premises of the argument are true (since even if \\(S\\) tried to\nchange the laws or the past, she would not succeed), but the\nconclusion is false (since determinism is consistent with the truth of\ncounterfactuals like \u201cif \\(S\\) tried to raise her hand, she\nwould\u201d).\n\nIncompatibilists were unmoved by this response, saying, in effect,\nthat the validity of Beta is more plausible than the truth of any\ncompatibilist account of ability to do otherwise. They pointed out\nthat there was no agreement, even among compatibilists, about how such\nan account should go, and that the simplest accounts (so-called\n\u201cConditional Analyses\u201d, originally proposed by Hume) had\nbeen rejected, even by compatibilists.\n\n(For criticism of Simple Conditional Analyses, see Austin 1956;\nChisholm 1964; Lehrer 1968, 1976; van Inwagen 1983. For defense of a\ncompatibilist account of ability to do otherwise, see Moore 1912;\nHobart 1934; Kapitan 1991, 1996, 2011; Lehrer 1980, 2004; Bok 1998;\nSmith 1997, 2004; Campbell 2005; Perry 2004, 2008, 2010; Vihvelin\n2004, 2013; Fara 2008; Schlosser 2017; Menzies 2017; List 2019.)\n\nMore recently, van Inwagen has conceded that Beta is invalid (van\nInwagen 2000). McKay and Johnson (1996) showed that Beta entails\nAgglomeration:\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{N}p\\)\n\n\\(\\mathbf{N}q\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\mathbf{N}(p \\amp q)\\)\n\n\nAgglomeration is uncontroversially invalid. To see this, let\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 abbreviate \u2018The coin does not land\nheads\u2019, let \u2018q\u2019 abbreviate \u2018The coin does not\nland tails\u2019, and suppose that it\u2019s a fair coin which\nisn\u2019t tossed but someone could have tossed it (McKay and Johnson\n1996).\n\n(For counterexamples to Beta, see Widerker 1987, Huemer 2000, and\nCarlson 2000.)\n\nVan Inwagen proposed to repair the Consequence argument by replacing\n\u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)\u2019 with \u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)*\u2019,\nwhere \u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}*p\\)\u2019\nsays \u201c\\(p\\) and\nno one can, or ever could, do anything such that if she did it, \\(p\\)\nmight be false\u201d. Agglomeration is valid for \u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)*\u2019,\nand thus this\nparticular objection to the validity of Beta does not apply.\n\nIt has also been suggested (Finch & Warfield 1998) that the\nConsequence argument can be repaired by keeping \u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)\u2019\nand replacing Beta with\nBeta 2:\n\n\nBeta 2: From \\(\\mathbf{N}p\\) and \\(\\Box(p \\supset\nq)\\), we may infer \\(\\mathbf{N}q\\)\n\n\nThis would yield the following argument:\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{N}(L \\amp H)\\)\nfixity of laws and past \n\n\\(\\Box((L \\amp H) \\supset P)\\)\ndeterminism \n\nNP\nfrom 1, 2 by Beta 2  \n\n\nOther ways of repairing the argument have been proposed by\nO\u2019Connor 1993 and Huemer 2000.\n\nSo it still looks as though the compatibilist is in trouble. For it\nseems plausible to suppose that there is nothing that we are able to\ndo that might make it the case that either \\(H\\) or \\(L\\) is\nfalse. And it seems plausible to suppose that we have no choice about\nwhether \\((H \\amp L)\\). We need to dig deeper to criticize the\nargument.\n\nDavid Lewis tells us to think of the argument as a reductio (Lewis\n1981). A compatibilist is someone who claims that the truth of\ndeterminism is compatible with the existence of the kinds of abilities\nthat we assume we have in typical choice situations. Let\u2019s call\nthese \u2018ordinary abilities\u2019. The Consequence argument, as\nLewis articulates it, says that if we assume that a deterministic\nagent has ordinary abilities, we are forced to credit her with\nincredible abilities as well.\n\nHere, with some modifications, is Lewis\u2019s statement of the\nargument:\n\nPretend that determinism is true, and that I did not raise my hand (at\nthat department meeting, to vote on that proposal) but had the ability\nto do so. If I had exercised my ability\u2014if I had raised my\nhand\u2014then either the remote past or the laws of physics would\nhave been different (would have to have been different). But if\nthat\u2019s so, then I have at least one of two incredible\nabilities\u2014the ability to change the remote past or the ability\nto change the laws. But to suppose that I have either of these\nabilities is absurd. So we must reject the claim that I had the\nability to raise my hand.\n\nThis counterfactual version of the Consequence argument nicely\nhighlights a point that the rule Beta version glosses over. The\nargument relies on a claim about counterfactuals. The\nargument says that if determinism is true, then at least one of these\ncounterfactuals is true:\n\n\nDifferent Past: If I had raised my hand, the remote\npast would have been different.\n\nDifferent Laws: If I had raised my hand, the laws\nwould have been different.\n\n\nBoth these counterfactuals strike many people as incredible. But there\nis a reason for that\u2014we are not used to thinking in terms of\ndeterminism and we are not accustomed to counterfactual speculation\nabout what would have been the case, beforehand, if anything\nat a deterministic world had happened in any way other than the way it\nactually happened.\n\nOn the other hand, we are good at evaluating counterfactuals, or at\nleast some counterfactuals, and we are especially good at evaluating\nthose counterfactuals that we entertain in contexts of choice, when we\nask questions about the causal upshots of our contemplated actions.\n(What would happen if\u2026 I struck this match, put my finger in\nthe fire, threw this rock at that window, raised my hand?) And when we\ncontemplate our options, we take for granted the existence of many\nfacts\u2014including facts about the laws and the past.\n\nIn other words, when we evaluate counterfactuals in real life, we do\nso by considering imaginary situations which are very like the\nsituation we are actually in, and we do not suppose that there are any\ngratuitous departures from actuality. And to suppose a\ndifference in the past or the laws seems like a gratuitous\ndifference.\n\nSo it is no surprise that when our attention is directed to\n Different Past\n and\n Different Laws,\n these counterfactuals strike us as incredible, or at least\nodd. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they are false, and if\ndeterminism is true, then either\n Different Past\n or\n Different Laws\nis true.\n\nSo the first point is that we all need a theory of counterfactuals,\nand if determinism is true, the true counterfactuals will include\neither\n Different Past\n or\n Different Laws.\n\nThe second point is that the details of the correct compatibilist\nsolution to the free will/determinism problem will turn on the details\nof the correct theory of counterfactuals.\n\n(For similar criticisms of the Consequence argument, see Fischer 1983,\n1988; Horgan 1985; Watson 1987; Vihvelin 1988, 2008, 2013; Rummens\n2021.)\n\nIf Lewis\u2019s theory of counterfactuals (D. Lewis 1973, 1979) is\ncorrect, or even more or less correct (Schaffer 2004), then the\nrelevant counterfactuals about the past and laws, at a deterministic\nworld, are:\n\n\nAlmost the Same Past: If I had raised my hand, the\npast would have been exactly the same until a time shortly before the\ntime of my decision to raise my hand.\n\nSlightly Different Laws: If I had raised my hand, the\nlaws would have been ever so slightly different in a way that\npermitted a divergence from the lawful course of actual history\nshortly before the time of my decision to raise my hand.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if Lewis\u2019s theory is wrong, and\ncounterfactuals are always evaluated by holding the laws constant,\nthen the relevant counterfactuals, at a deterministic world, are:\n\n\nSame Laws: If I had raised my hand, the laws would\nstill have been exactly the same.\n\nDifferent Past: If I had raised my hand, past history\nwould have been at least somewhat different all the way back to the\nBig Bang.\n\n\n(For critique of Lewis\u2019s theory, and defense of a theory of\ncounterfactuals that holds the laws fixed, see Bennett 1984; Dorr\n2016; Vihvelin 2017b.)\n\nWe\u2019ve got to choose. We all need a theory of counterfactuals,\nand our theory should provide the correct verdicts for the\nuncontroversially true counterfactuals at deterministic as well as\nindeterministic worlds. Our choice is limited to a theory that accepts\n Different Laws\n or\n Different Past.\n Which theory we choose has nothing to do with the free\nwill/determinism problem and everything with how we evaluate\ncounterfactuals.\n\nWe can now explain the essence of Lewis\u2019s reply to the\ncounterfactual version of the Consequence argument in a way that\ndoesn\u2019t require you to accept Lewis\u2019s theory of\ncounterfactuals.\n\nThe argument trades on an equivocation between two\ncounterfactuals.\n\n(C1)\nIf I had raised my hand, the laws (or the past) would have been\ndifferent.\n(C2)\nIf I had raised my hand, I would thereby have caused the\nlaws (or the past) to be different.\n\n\nThere is a corresponding equivocation between two ability claims:\n\n(A1)\nI had the ability to do something (raise my hand) such that if I\nhad exercised my ability, the laws (or the past) would have been\ndifferent.\n(A2)\nI had the ability to do something (raise my hand) such that if I\nhad exercised my ability, I would thereby have caused the\nlaws (or the past) to be different.\n\n\nThe problem with the argument, says Lewis, is that it equivocates\nbetween these two ability claims. To count as a reductio against the\ncompatibilist, the argument must establish that the compatibilist is\ncommitted to\n (A2).\n But the compatibilist is committed only to\n (C1)\n and thus only to\n (A1).\n The compatibilist is committed only to saying that if determinism is\ntrue, we have abilities we would exercise only if the past\n(or the laws) had been different in the appropriate ways. And while\nthis may sound odd, it is no more incredible than the claim that the\nsuccessful exercise of our abilities depends, not only on us, but also\non the co-operation of things not in our control: the good or bad luck\nof our immediate surroundings. Since we are neither superheroes nor\ngods, we are always in this position, regardless of the truth or\nfalsity of determinism.\n\nThe Consequence Argument was intended as an argument from premises\nthat we must all accept\u2014premises about our lack of control over\nthe past and the laws\u2014to the conclusion that if determinism is\ntrue, we don\u2019t have the free will common sense says we have. The\ncounterfactual version of the argument claims that if we attribute\nordinary abilities to deterministic agents, we are forced to credit\nthem with incredible past or law-changing abilities as well. But no\nsuch incredible conclusion follows. All that follows is something that\nwe must accept anyway, as the price of our non-godlike nature: that\nthe exercise of our abilities always depends, in part, on\ncircumstances outside our control. (See also Fischer 1983, 1988, 1994;\nWatson 1987; Nelkin 2001; Vihvelin 2008, 2011, 2013, 2017; Kapitan\n1991, 2011; Carlson 2000.)\n\nIf the aim of the Consequence argument was to show that no\ncompatibilist account of \u2018could have done otherwise\u2019\ncan succeed, then Lewis is surely right; the reductio fails.\nThe distinction between\n (A1)\n and\n (A2)\n permits the compatibilist to avoid making incredible claims about the\npowers of free determined agents. On the other hand, the\nincompatibilist surely has a point when she complains that it is\ndifficult to believe that anyone has the ability described by\n (A1).\n We believe that our powers as agents are constrained by the past and\nby the laws. One way to understand this belief is compatible with\ndeterminism: we lack causal power over the past and\nthe laws. But it\u2019s natural to understand the constraint\nin a different, simpler way: we are able to do only those things which\nare such that our doing of them does not counterfactually require a\ndifference in either the past or the laws. And this leads more or less\ndirectly to the incompatibilist conclusion that if determinism is\ntrue, then we are never able to do otherwise.\n\nThis brings us back to our starting point. Our common sense web of\nbeliefs about ourselves as deliberators, choosers, and agents includes\nthe belief that the future is open in some sense that the past is not.\nIt also includes the belief that our abilities and powers are\nconstrained by the laws. One way of understanding these beliefs leads\nto incompatibilism; another way does not. Which one is right?\n\nThe Consequence argument is an attempt to provide an argument\nin defense of the incompatibilist\u2019s way of understanding these\ncommon sense beliefs. Even if it fails as a reductio, it has been\nsuccessful in other ways. It has made it clear that the free\nwill/determinism problem is a metaphysical problem and that the\nunderlying issues concern questions about our abilities and powers, as\nwell as more general questions about the nature of causation,\ncounterfactuals, and laws of nature. Can the abilities or powers of\nchoosers and agents be understood as a kind of natural capacity or\ndisposition? Is there a viable incompatibilist alternative? How should\nwe understand counterfactuals about the alternative actions and\nchoices of agents at deterministic worlds? Is the compatibilist\nproposal about the way in which the laws and past constrain us\ndefensible? Are incompatibilists committed to the defense of a\nparticular view about the nature of laws of nature? Are they committed\nto the rejection of a Humean view, for instance?\n\nInsofar as the Consequence argument has pointed us in the direction of\nthese deep and difficult underlying metaphysical questions, it\nrepresents a significant step forward in the discussion of one of the\nmost intractable problems of philosophy.
