    "main_text": "Thought || The Esoteric View of the Buddha: The Four Embodiments of Truth (the Dharma)\n3.3 The Esoteric View of the Buddha: The Four Embodiments of Truth (the Dharma)\n\nIn order to understand the above-mentioned distinctions made by\nK\u016bkai, we need to comprehend what exactly the Buddha signifies\nfor K\u016bkai. This is also important as his esoteric view of the\nBuddha underlies all of the major points of his philosophy that we\nshall be discussing further below.\n\nIn traditional Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist theory, the Buddha is\nconceived in terms of three modes or forms of embodiments\n(trik\u0101ya): dharmak\u0101ya (Jpn:\nhosshin), nirmanak\u0101ya, and\nsambhogak\u0101ya. While originally the term buddha,\nmeaning \u201cenlightened one,\u201d was reserved for\n\u015aakyamuni, the historical founder of Buddhism, it eventually came\nto designate the ideal for humanity. This ideal became equated with\nthe \u201ctruth\u201d (Skrt: Dharma; Jpn:\nh\u014d), taught by the Buddha, of the nature of being. To be\na \u201cbuddha\u201d is then to be enlightened to that truth, which\ncame to also mean the realization of one\u2019s non-duality with the\nDharma. It is in this significance that one way of understanding the\nBuddha is in terms of the universal \u201cembodiment of the\nDharma\u201d (Skrt: dharmak\u0101ya; Jpn: hosshin).\nFor traditional Mah\u0101y\u0101na, this hosshin is an\nabstract principle and hence impersonal and non-preaching. However as\nimplied in the foregoing section, for K\u016bkai the hosshin\nis identified with the Buddha Dainichi. That is, in one aspect the\nhosshin may be understood to be a personal being who preaches\nthe Dharma by concretizing it in the cosmos as his own body. (Of\ncourse though to avoid anthropomorphism, the hosshin cannot\nbe reduced to this aspect.) In the traditional three-body doctrine,\nhowever, it is the other two forms of embodiment that preach. The\nBuddha, when regarded as embodying the Dharma in an historical earthly\nbeing, such as \u015aakyamuni, who preaches the Dharma to humans, is\ncalled the nirmanak\u0101ya (\u201cembodiment of\ntransformation\u201d). And the Buddha as enjoying his fruits of\nenlightenment by residing in a celestial buddha-realm, while unfolding\nfurther truths for advanced bodhisattva beings and acting as a savior\nto the earthly, is called the sambhogak\u0101ya\n(\u201cembodiment of bliss\u201d). An example of would be Amida\nresiding in his \u201cPure Land.\u201d\n\nWhat distinguishes K\u016bkai\u2019s understanding of the Buddha is\nthat he takes the notion of the \u201cembodiment of the Dharma\u201d\nliterally and radically. Hosshin in Shingon thought is not an\nabstract truth transcending the mundane world. Rather all\nphenomena and thing-events of this cosmos, in their very transience,\nare each themselves embodiments of truth and the cosmos as a whole\ncomprised of these impermanent and interdependent beings is eternally\nan embodiment of truth, the hosshin. Moreover this concrete\ncosmic identification between Buddha, truth, and the cosmos of\nthing-events, was \u201cpersonal.\u201d That is, hosshin\nwas equated with the Buddha Dainichi. The cosmos as the\nmanifestation of truth, the Dharma, was itself hence equated with the\nbody of the personal Buddha Dainichi. And in turn, Dainichi with his\ncosmic body is then the embodied personification of the universal\nBuddha-nature inherent in all beings and the Dharma that is manifest\neverywhere. Prior to Hui-kuo, this identification of Dainichi with the\nhosshin in Mantray\u0101na Buddhism was ambiguous and not\nthorough. In the Dainichi-ky\u014d, a sun metaphor is used to\nname its central Buddha, \u201cDainichi\u201d\n(Mah\u0101vairocana, transliterated as\nMakabirushana), meaning \u201cGreat Sun,\u201d as the being\nwhose light illuminates and enlightens all beings in a way akin to the\nsun\u2019s life-giving light. All other deities are seen as\nmanifestations of this light. Dainichi\u2019s identification with the\nhosshin nevertheless remains ambiguous. While he probably\ninfluenced K\u016bkai in regards to this equation, Hui-kuo himself\nhowever left no written explications. K\u016bkai thus has been\nregarded as the first to provide a complete and systematic exposition\nof the nature of the Buddha Dainichi as the hosshin.\nThe sun metaphor of illumination \u2013 as the source of both being\nand of knowledge (enlightenment) \u2013 befits the universality of\nthe hosshin perfectly. The illumination of the \u201cGreat\nSun\u201d (Dainichi) becomes accordingly understood to mean the\nomnipresencing of the Dharma throughout the cosmos, an omnipresencing\nin turn equated with the Buddha\u2019s preaching. This\n\u201cproof\u201d that the hosshin does in fact preach\nhelped K\u016bkai in distinguishing his esoteric doctrines from those\nof exoteric Buddhism.\n\nThis identification between Dainichi and hosshin held many\nimplications for K\u016bkai, which became worked out in his various\ndoctrines. For example, the equation of Dainichi\u2019s body-and-mind\nwith the cosmos itself also means the immanent presence of the Buddha\nwithin, and as, the body-and-mind of each and every one of\nus. And so Dainichi\u2019s \u201cenlightened mind\u201d\n(bodhicitta) becomes synonymous with the Mah\u0101y\u0101na\ndoctrine of \u201coriginal enlightenment\u201d (hongaku)\nwithin all beings. But as the Dharma signifies the interdependent\norigination, hence, emptiness (k\u016b) of all beings, its\nembodiment may be said to be an \u201cempty body.\u201d We will\nexamine these ideas in greater detail later.\n\nK\u016bkai\u2019s Shingon Buddhism postulated four forms of\nembodiment as the hosshin itself. This notion of the\nfour forms of the hosshin (shishu hosshin) roughly\ncorresponds to, while reworking, the Mah\u0101y\u0101na\ntrik\u0101ya doctrine. 1) First there is the hosshin\nin its absolute sense, called jish\u014d hosshin.\nThis is the embodiment of the Dharma as Dainichi eternally remaining\nin the state of samadhi but also engaging in a monologue,\nwhich reveals its \u201cself-nature\u201d and unfolds the Dharma\nthrough its omni-presencing manifestations in the cosmos. 2) Secondly\nthere is the juy\u016b hosshin, which is the\nhosshin enjoying bliss. But this is characterized in its two\naspects: A) \u201cthe self-oriented embodiment\u201d\n(jijuy\u016bshin) describing the hosshin as enjoying\nits own state of samadhic bliss; and B) \u201cthe\nother-oriented embodiment\u201d (tajuy\u016bshin) describing\nthe hosshin in the form of various celestial buddhas\ndirecting the blissful fruits of self-enlightenment for the benefit of\nothers. 3) Thirdly there is the hosshin in its historical and\nearthly transformation, called henge hosshin as\nmanifest in the enlightened personage of \u015aakyamuni. This\nhistorical Buddha guides ordinary, ignorant, and irreligious people\ntowards the Dharma, but for this sake must improvise skillful (or:\nexpedient) means (Skrt: up\u0101ya; Jpn: h\u014dben)\nappropriate to the time, place, and comprehension of a given audience.\n4) And fourthly there is the hosshin in its universal\nemanation, called t\u014dru hosshin. This is its\nmanifestation in all sorts of bodily forms appropriate to the\nsituation in order to expound the Dharma, often appearing in the same\nform as the listener in order to share in his suffering. This\nconception also became generalized by K\u016bkai to include all\nphenomenal thing-events \u2013 together with their respective\nenvironments or \u201crealms\u201d \u2013 as \u201cbodies\u201d\nfilling up the entire cosmos. As such every phenomenon plays the role\nof a \u201cbuddha,\u201d teaching some aspect of the Dharma and\nexpressing the Buddha\u2019s enlightened wisdom and compassion, to\nrealize the original enlightenment of all. Interestingly this implies\nthat each one of us are already buddhas expounding some\naspect of the Dharma to one another, but which we must then become\naware of in order to realize our own Buddhahood.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the celestial buddhas and the\nhistorical buddha (\u015aakyamuni) are here included as themselves\nforms of the hosshin, when in the traditional\ntrik\u0101ya doctrine of Mah\u0101y\u0101na, they were\ndistinguished from the hosshin, which in turn was seen as\nabstract and impersonal. Furthermore, according to this doctrine of\nthe four forms of the hosshin, it is not only the celestial\nbuddhas in the heavens and the historical buddha on earth who preach,\nbut all four forms. From K\u016bkai\u2019s esoteric\nstandpoint, the hosshin even in its samadhic\nself-enjoyment is preaching the Dharma in its cosmic monologue \u2013\nfor its very embodiment is the cosmos itself so that its\nsamadhic experiencing of the Dharma permeates everywhere and\neverywhen. Simply put, Dainichi as the hosshin and\nas the personification of the Dharma concretely embodied in\nthe cosmos, is directly preaching the Dharma to the world via\nhis omni-presencing being. And while in the broader sense the\nhosshin is thus preaching via the cosmos, in the\nnarrower sense its preaching is manifest in the teachings of esoteric\nBuddhism itself. On the other hand the doctrines of what K\u016bkai\nclassified as exoteric are traced to either what the historical\nbuddha, \u015aakyamuni, preached or what the celestial buddhas are\npreaching in the heavenly dimensions. Insofar as they themselves are\nembodiments of the hosshin, what they preach are indirectly\nteachings of the hosshin. But their teachings are\nprovisional, relative only to the comprehension of their audience and\nthe circumstance of time and place wherein they are preached.\nK\u016bkai claims, however, that through training in Shingon\nesotericism, one can receive the teachings of the hosshin\ndirectly \u2013 that is, receive the timeless and absolute,\ncosmic and holistic, truth of the Dharma in its very embodiment. This\nwas a radical and heterodox claim at the time since the teaching\ncommon to all orthodox Buddhist schools was that the s\u016btras can\nall be traced back to the preachings of \u015aakyamuni and this\nlineage is what legitimated their use of the s\u016btras. But for\nK\u016bkai, the historical Buddha was but one manifestation of the\ncosmic Buddha, Dainichi, who embodies the truth (Dharma,\nh\u014d) it preaches as the hosshin.\n",
