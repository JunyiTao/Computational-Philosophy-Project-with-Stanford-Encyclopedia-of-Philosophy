    "main_text": "Counterfactuals and Philosophy\n1. Counterfactuals and Philosophy\n\nThis section begins with some terminological issues\n (\u00a71.1).\n It then provides two broad surveys of research that places\ncounterfactuals at the center of key philosophical issues.\n Section 1.2\n covers the role of counterfactuals in theories of rational agency,\nmental representation, and knowledge.\n Section 1.3\n focuses on the central role of counterfactuals in metaphysics and the\nphilosophy of science.\n Section 1.4\n will then bring a bit of drama to the narrative by explaining how\ncounterfactuals are deeply puzzling from the perspective of classical\nand modal logics alike.\n",
