Anscombe\ndescribes knowledge without observation as a form of practical\nknowledge. In a nutshell, knowing that your legs are crossed is not\nfeeling them to be crossed; it is knowing how to uncross them. Along\nthe same lines, Merleau-Ponty claims that the lived body is a space of\npossibilities for actions. There is, however, a major difference. For\nthe phenomenologist tradition, what we feel is determined by\nwhat we know how to do. For Anscombe, on the contrary, we do not feel\nanything. Instead, one should say that what we report is\ndetermined by what we know how to do. Furthermore, the emphasis on\naction does not necessarily entail giving up the perceptual model of\nbodily awareness and one should be careful distinguishing the two\nclaims.\n\nTwo main sensorimotor views of perceptual awareness have indeed\nrecently been proposed (see Entry on Action-based theories of\nperception). According to the enactive approach, perceptual\nexperiences consist in sensorimotor expectations (O\u2019Regan &\nNo\u00eb 2001; No\u00eb 2004; Hurley 1998; Thompson 2005;\nO\u2019Regan 2011). According to the dispositional approach, the\nspatial content of perceptual experiences is made possible by\ndispositions to act (Evans 1982; Brewer 1995; Briscoe 2009; A. J. T.\nSmith 2009; Mandrigin forthcoming). Despite apparent similarities, the\ntwo views make different claims. The enactive view aims to account for\nconsciousness in general, for its phenomenal character (O\u2019Regan\n2011). By contrast, the dispositional account applies only to\negocentric content. Furthermore, the enactive view makes a\nconstitutive claim: bodily experiences are inseparable from\nsensorimotor expectations (for discussion of the constitutive claim,\nsee Block 2005). By contrast, the dispositional view does not claim\nthat the spatial content represents dispositions to act. It only makes\n\u201ca claim about the conditions under which a visual experience\nwill have such content\u201d (Briscoe 2014: 208). \n\nA major challenge for the sensorimotor approaches is to account for\ndissociations between perception and action. Such dissociations have\nbeen found for vision, leading Milner and Goodale (1995) to propose\na dual model of visual processing: the ventral pathway is dedicated to\nconscious perception whereas the dorsal pathway is dedicated to\nvisuomotor transformation perception. Dissociations have also been\nreported in the case of bodily awareness. For instance, patients with\nnumbsense have no tactile awareness, but retain a surprising ability\nto point to where they were touched (Paillard et al., 1983; see also\nAnema et al. 2009 for further dissociation). The rubber hand illusion\nas well indicates that bodily know-how can be at odds with bodily\nexperiences: participants accurately grasp the stimulated hand with\ntheir opposite hand at its real location, and not at the illusory\nlocation that they report (Kammers et al. 2009). Proponents of the\nenactive view may have difficulties accounting for this type of\nresults, which indicate that sensorimotor knowledge is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient for bodily experiences (Vignemont 2011).\nHowever, perception-action dissociations are less problematic for the\ndispositional view (Mandrigin forthcoming).\n\nWe have just asked whether bodily awareness requires action. But one\nmay also ask whether action requires bodily awareness\n(O\u2019Shaughnessy 2000; Wong 2015). Action requires detailed\ninformation about the long-term and short-term properties of the\nbodily effectors. But does the information need to reach the threshold\nof awareness, even at the margin? Action requires fast processing of\ninformation, whereas bodily awareness takes time. Furthermore,\ndeafferented subjects who have no kinaesthetic and tactile awareness\nof their body retain their ability to control their movements as long\nas they receive visual feedback. Hence, kinaesthetic experiences do\nnot seem to be necessary for action. The body is not always\nimmediately present in all its details to the subject, even when\nacting. Yet as Descartes pointed out, we are not like pilots in a\nship. The difference is that we are able to feel our ship from the\ninside. Hence, there must still be a connection, still to be explored,\nbetween our capacity to act directly with our body and our capacity to\nfeel our body from the inside (Wong 2015).\n",
