Let us now view the result\nin the context of Tarski\u2019s approach to truth.\n\nTarski clearly distinguished the object language, i.e., the language\nthe truth of whose sentences is at stake, and the metalanguage in\nwhich the former is discussed. He also required (see the entry on\n Tarski\u2019s truth definitions)\n that any satisfactory definition of truth \\(\\True(x)\\) for\nthe object language should satisfy his \u201cConvention T\u201d,\nthat is, it should have as its consequence all equivalences\n(\u201cT-equivalences\u201d) of the form\n\n\\[\\tag{T}\n\\True(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow B,\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner\\) is a name of a\nsentence of the object language, and \\(B\\) its translation in the\nmetalanguage. If the metalanguage is identical with the object\nlanguage, or is an extension of the object language, \\(B\\) is\nsimply \\(A\\) itself, and the T-equivalences are of the form:\n\n\\[\n\\True(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow A.\n\\]\n\n\nWhat the undefinability theorem shows is that the object language and\nthe metalanguage cannot coincide, but must be distinct.\n\n\nTarski\u2019s Undefinability Theorem\n\nLet \\(F\\) be a consistent formalized system that contains a sufficient\namount of arithmetic. Then there is no formula \\(Tr(x)\\) in the\nlanguage of \\(F\\) such that for every sentence \\(A\\) of the language\nof \\(F\\):\n\n\\[\nF \\vdash Tr(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow A.\n\\]\n\nThe idea of the proof: If there were such a formula\nof the language of \\(F\\), an easy application of the Diagonalization\nLemma to its negation would result in the paradoxical sentence \\(L\\)\n(for \u201cLiar\u201d; see the Liar paradox)), such that:\n\n\\[\nF \\vdash \\neg Tr(\\ulcorner L\\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow L,\n\\]\n\nwhich, together with the T-equivalences, which were assumed to be\nderivable, would quickly give an explicit contradiction, thus\ncontradicting the assumption that \\(F\\) is consistent.\n\n\nSimilarly, it can be proved that the set of true sentences of \\(F\\)\nis not definable in the intended interpretation of \\(F\\)\u2014in\nthe now standard sense of \u201cdefinability\u201d (see above). \n",
