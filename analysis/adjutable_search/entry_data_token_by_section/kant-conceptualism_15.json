One version or other of this point\nhas been noted by a variety of scholars (Wilson 1975; Aquila 1994;\nFalkenstein 1995: 139; Mohr 1998: 112\u2013113; Aquila 2001; Bell\n2001; Fichant 2004; Banham 2005: ch.6; Messina 2014; McLear 2015;\nAllison 2015, 410ff; Onof and Schulting 2015; Guyer 2018; Roche 2018).\nHere, in brief, is the most straightforward version of the argument\nchallenging Intellectualism:\n\nThe structure of pure intuition (or its content) is one according\nto which the parts of the representation are determined by the\nwhole\nThe structure of a representation that depends for its generation\non an act of synthesis is one according to which the whole is\ndetermined by its parts\n\u2234 The pure representations of space and time cannot be\ndependent on synthetic acts for their generation.\n\n\nThe evidence for premise (1) comes in part from the third argument in\nthe Metaphysical Exposition of space (fourth in the case of time):\n\n\n[I]f one speaks of many spaces, one understands by that only parts of\none and the same unique space. And these parts cannot as it were\nprecede the single all-encompassing space as its components (from\nwhich its composition would be possible), but rather are only thought\nin it. It is essentially single [einig]; the manifold in it,\nthus also the general concept of spaces in general, rests merely on\nlimitations. (A24\u20135/B39)\n\n\nEvidence for premise (2) comes in consideration of both Kant\u2019s\npositive characterization of our intellectual activity (this is meant\nto include the activity of the productive imagination) and his\ncontrast of our intellectual forms of representation with God\u2019s\nintuitive intellect.\n\nKant characterizes our intellectual activity as\n\u2018discursive\u2019 to denote the manner in which the\nunderstanding acts\u2014viz. moving to and fro, from part to\npart\u2014rather than merely as a synonym for\n\u2018conceptual\u2019, \u2018linguistic\u2019, or\n\u2018rational\u2019. It is this notion he means to indicate in his\ntalk of \u201crunning through\u201d and \u201cgathering\ntogether\u201d (A99) representations.\n\nIt is this activity of moving from part to part in the connection of\nrepresentations that also informs Kant\u2019s general\ncharacterization of synthesis:\n\n\nBy synthesis in the most general sense, however, I understand the\naction of putting different representations together with each other\nand comprehending their manifoldness in one cognition. (A77/B103)\n\n\nAdditional support for both premises comes in reflecting on the\nmereological manner in which Kant contrasts our discursive intellect\nwith God\u2019s intuitive intellect:\n\n\n[W]e can also conceive of an understanding which, since it is not\ndiscursive like ours but is intuitive, goes from the\nsynthetically universal (of the intuition of a whole\nas such) to the particular, i.e., from the whole to the parts, in\nwhich, therefore, and in whose representation of the whole, there is\nno contingency in the combination of the parts, in\norder to make possible a determinate form of the whole, which is\nneeded by our understanding, which must progress from the parts, as\nuniversally conceived grounds, to the different possible forms, as\nconsequences, that can be subsumed under it. (KU, 5:407)\n\n\nThus, if the content of pure intuition is such that the (intuited)\nwhole is prior to its parts, and synthesis is a process that\nessentially moves from part to part, resulting in the reverse\nmereological relation, it cannot be the case that the pure intuitions\nresult from a synthesis.\n\nHere an Intellectualist might deny that all \u2018higher\u2019\ncognitive activity should be understood as \u2018discursive\u2019 in\nthe above sense. Hence, a central issue concerns whether it makes\nsense to say that there is a form of synthesis that is non-discursive\nin a manner that does not threaten Kant\u2019s characterization of\nthe structure of pure intuition (Williams 2018). Now, it certainly is\npossible for Intellectualism to defend a more limited claim,\nconcerning only empirical intuition (McLear 2015: 93\u201395;\nGr\u00fcne 2016). But such a restricted version gives up the\ndialectically central motivation that Intellectualism, in claiming a\ndependence of the pure forms of intuition on the intellect, is the\nonly means of making intelligible the argument of the Deduction. Thus,\nretreat to a restricted form of Intellectualism claiming merely that\nparticular empirical intuitions depend on the intellect undermines one\nof the central pillars sustaining the Intellectualist interpretation\n(McLear 2015: 94).\n",
