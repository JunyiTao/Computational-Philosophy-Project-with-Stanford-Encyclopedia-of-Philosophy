Analytic proof methods for hybrid logic\n\nTableau, Gentzen, and natural deduction style proof-theory for hybrid\nlogic work very well compared to ordinary modal logic. Usually, when a\nmodal tableau, Gentzen, or natural deduction system is given, it is\nfor one particular modal logic and it has turned out to be problematic\nto formulate such systems for modal logics in a uniform way without\nintroducing metalinguistic machinery. This can be remedied by\nhybridization, that is, hybridization of modal logics enables the\nformulation of uniform tableau, Gentzen, and natural deduction systems\nfor wide classes of logics. The paper Blackburn (2000) introduces a\ntableau system for hybrid logic that has this desirable feature:\nAnalogous to the axiom system of Blackburn and Tzakova (1999),\ncompleteness is preserved if the tableau system is extended with a set\nof pure axioms, that is, a set of pure formulas that are allowed to be\nadded to a tableau during the tableau construction. The tableau system\nof Blackburn (2000) is the basis for a decision procedure for the\nbinder-free fragment of hybrid logic given in Bolander and\nBra\u00fcner (2006). This line of work has been continued in the\npapers Bolander and Blackburn (2007) and Bolander and Blackburn\n(2009). The paper Cerrito and Cialdea (2010) presents another\ntableau-based decision procedure for hybrid logic. Other decision\nprocedures for hybrid logics, which also are based on proof-theory,\nare given in the paper Kaminski and Smolka (2009). The procedures of\nthe latter paper are based on a higher-order formulation of hybrid\nlogic involving the simply typed lambda calculus.\n\nThe article Hansen, Bolander, and Bra\u00fcner (2018) gives a\ntableau-based decision procedure for many-valued hybrid logic, that\nis, hybrid logic where the two-valued classical logic basis has been\ngeneralized to a many-valued logic basis involving a truth-value space\nhaving the structure of a finite Heyting algebra. Hansen (2010) gives\na tableau-based decision procedure for a hybridized version of a\ndynamic epistemic logic called public annoucement logic. This is also\na major issue of the PhD thesis Hansen (2011).\n\nNatural deduction style proof-theory of hybrid logic has been explored\nin the book Bra\u00fcner (2011a). This book also gives a cut-free\nGentzen sequent system for hybrid logic. Cut-freeness is proved via a\nnormalizing natural deduction system, but such a result can also be\nproved directly, see Indrzejczak (2016). The natural deduction and\nGentzen systems of Bra\u00fcner (2011a) can be extended with\nadditional proof-rules corresponding to first-order conditions on the\naccessibility relations expressed by so-called geometric\ntheories (this is of course analogous to extending tableau and\naxiom systems with pure axioms). See also Bra\u00fcner and de Paiva\n(2006) where a natural deduction system is given for intuitionistic\nhybrid logic (Chapter 8 of Bra\u00fcner (2011a)).\n\nGentzen and natural deduction systems for logics similar to hybrid\nlogics were explored already in the 1990s by Jerry Seligman, see the\noverview in Seligman (2001). In particular, Seligman developed\nproof-systems that work with arbitrary formulas, not just satisfaction\nstatements, the latter being the case for most proof-systems for\nhybrid logic, where satisfaction operators are used to access\ninformation hidden behind modalities. A natural deduction system in\nthis style was introduced in Seligman (1997) and this system has been\nfurther developed in Chapter 4 of the book Bra\u00fcner (2011a). A\ntableau systems in Seligman\u2019s proof-style has been considered in\nBlackburn, Bolander, Bra\u00fcner, and J\u00f8rgensen (2017) where a\nsyntactic completeness proof is given. A semantic completenes proof of\nthe tableau system is given in J\u00f8rgensen, Blackburn, Bolander,\nBra\u00fcner (2016). Reasoning in these systems does not directly rely\non the global encodings that satisfaction operators make possible,\nhence, these systems can be considered more in line with the local\ncharacter of the standard Kripke semantics for modal logic. In fact,\nthis more local reasoning style makes these systems suitable for\nformalizing the perspectival reasoning taking place in certain\npsychological reasoning tasks, see Bra\u00fcner (2014b) as well as\nBra\u00fcner, Blackburn, and Polyanskaya (2016).\n\nAs mentioned above, the papers Blackburn, Bolander, Bra\u00fcner, and\nJ\u00f8rgensen (2017) and J\u00f8rgensen, Blackburn, Bolander,\nBra\u00fcner (2016) gave completenes proofs for Seligman-style tableau\nsystems for hybrid logic. Based on these results, completeness for\nthese systems have in From (2021) and From, Blackburn, and Villadsen\n(2020) been fully formalised using the proof assistant\nIsabelle/HOL.\n\nSome work in resolution calculi and model checking has been carried\nout, see Areces, de Rijke, and de Nivelle (2001) as well as Areces and\nGorin (2011) for resolution calculi and see as Franceschet and de\nRijke (2006) as well as Lange (2009) for results on model\nchecking.\n",
