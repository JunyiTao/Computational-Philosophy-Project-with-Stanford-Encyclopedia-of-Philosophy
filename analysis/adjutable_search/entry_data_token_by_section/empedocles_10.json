    "main_text": "Relation of On Nature to Purifications\n5. Influence\n\nAs a testament to the success of Empedocles\u2019 philosophy in its\nafterlife, the philosopher boasts the largest number of preserved\nPresocratic fragments. His popularity soon after his death is assured\nby a reference to him in the Hippocratic Ancient Medicine, in\nwhich the author protests that:\n\n\nSome doctors and experts (sophistae) say that it is\nimpossible for anyone to know medicine who does not know what a human\nbeing is [\u2026]. But what they are talking about belongs to\nphilosophy (philosophi\u0113), like Empedocles and other\npeople who have written about nature\u2014what a human being is from\nthe beginning, how he came about at first and what things he is\nconstituted of. (A 71 = R 6)\n\n\nPart of this success must be attributed to Empedocles\u2019\nreputation as a poet rivaling Homer for his inspired use of expression\nand metaphor (A 1 = R 1b).\n\nYet Empedocles\u2019 philosophical theories too excited great\ninterest in his successors. Plato regularly refers to him by name, and\nin the Symposium he puts in the mouth of the comic poet\nAristophanes a re-worked version of the origin of the human that\nlampoons Empedoclean Love and Strife and Empedocles\u2019\ninterpretation of the evolutionary development of the human species: a\nformer spherical unity is split into two and then only comes together\nthrough the influence of erotic Love (O\u2019Brien 2002). Aristotle\nwas similarly influenced by him; he mentions no philosopher with\ngreater frequency except Plato. His critiques range from\nEmpedocles\u2019 treatment of the generation of elements (R 8a), to\nthe problems of Love and Strife as motive principles (A 42 = R 12 and\n13), to the motionlessness of the earth (R 14), to the growth of\nplants and animals (A 70 = R 17), to the generation of animal\norganisms (R 19). His successor, Theophrastus, devotes a long,\nagonistic section of his On Sensations to attacking\nEmpedocles\u2019 interpretations of sight, sound, smell, and thought\n(A 86 = R 25). Timon of Phlius\u2019 Silloi ridiculed his\nuse of elements (A 1 = R 37). Empedocles remained a touchstone among\nthe Stoics and Epicureans as well: a pupil of Epicurus\u2019,\nHermarchus, wrote an Against Empedocles in twenty-two books\n(Obbink 1988), while in his De Rerum Natura, Lucretius offers\nfulsome\u2014though not unqualified\u2014praise of the Agrigentine,\nwho \u201cscarcely seems to have been born of human stock\u201d (A\n21.21 = R 31.733; complete translation of the entire work is in Rouse\n1924). Chrysippus is said to have interpreted passages of his poetry\n(R 40a\u2013b) and the Stoics were associated with the element of\nfire that Empedocles may have given some prominence to (A 31 = R\n41). Sallust composed an entire Empedoclea, which Cicero\ncommended to his brother (A 27 = R 36). Thanks to this robust early\ntradition, rich exegesis on Empedocles continued in commentaries\nwritten on these authors and by the early Christians until well into\nlate antiquity. Empedocles\u2019 immortal hold on his readers\ncontinues. Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s unfinished drafts of\nDer Tod des Empedokles continue to inspire modern analysis\n(Foti 2006), and Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cstillbirth\u201d tragedy on\nEmpedocles has been well-treated recently (Most 2005), as has Matthew\nArnold\u2019s \u201cEmpedocles on Etna\u201d (Kenny 2005).\n",
