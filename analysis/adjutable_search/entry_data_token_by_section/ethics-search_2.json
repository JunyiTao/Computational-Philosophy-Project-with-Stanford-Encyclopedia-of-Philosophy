Yet, the early work in search/information\nretrieval systems was carried out independently of developments in\nelectronic computing. Whereas the first (general purpose) electronic\ncomputer\u2014the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And\nComputer)\u2014was completed in November 1945 and announced in\nFebruary 1946 (Palfreman and Swade, 1991), several decades would pass\nbefore Internet search engines became available. Because ENIAC and\nother early computers were designed primarily to \u201ccrunch\nnumbers,\u201d relatively little thought had been given to the kinds\nof information-retrieval systems that could be used to search\nthrough the large amount of data that those non-networked (or\n\u201cstand-alone\u201d) computers were capable of storing. However,\nsome information-retrieval theorists, as we shall see, had already\nbegun to worry about the amount of information that was becoming\navailable during this period and that, in all likelihood, would\nproliferate with the advent of computers. In particular, they were\nconcerned about how an ever-expanding repository of information could\nbe organized and retrieved in a practical way.  Halavais (2009, 13)\nnotes that early computers \u201cdrew on the ideas of librarians and\nfiling clerks\u201d for arranging the stored information that would\nbe retrieved. But some of the leading thinkers in the emerging field\nof information retrieval (or IR), which Van Couvering (2008) describes\nas a \u201chybrid\u201d academic discipline combining elements of\ninformation science and computer science, saw that traditional methods\nfor retrieving information would not be effective in the era of\nelectronic computer systems.\n\n\nOne visionary who saw the need for a new kind of organizing and\nretrieval scheme to manage the expanding volume of information was\nVannevar Bush, perhaps the most important figure in the history of\ninformation-retrieval/search-engine theory in the pre-Internet era. In\nhis classic article, \u201cAs We May Think\u201d (Atlantic\nMonthly, July 1945), published approximately six months before\nENIAC\u2019s official announcement, Bush remarked,\n\nThe summation of human experience is being expanded at a\nprodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the\nconsequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was\nused in the days of square-rigged ships.\n\n\n\nHowever, Bush believed that a technological solution to this problem\nwas possible through a system he called memex, which he\ndescribed as a\n\ndevice in which an individual stores all his\nbooks, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it\ncan be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.\n\n\n Bush\nenvisioned the memex behaving like an \u201cintricate web of\ntrails\u201d similar to the function of the human mind, which he\nbelieved works by a method of \u201cassociation\u201d and not via an\nalphabetical index (of the kind typically used in libraries and other\ncataloging schemes). According to Levy (2008, 508), the most\n\u201cinnovative feature\u201d of Bush\u2019s memex system was the\nestablishing of\n\nassociative indices between portions of\nmicrofilmed text\u2014what we now call hypertext links\u2014so\nthat researchers could follow trails of useful information through\nmasses of literature.\n\n Via Bush\u2019s \u201cassociative\nindexing\u201d scheme, different pieces of information could be linked\nor tied together, \u201cas any single item may be caused at will to\nselect immediately and automatically another.\u201d Thus, Bush is\noften credited with having anticipated the kinds of search engine\nfunctions that would eventually be used on the Internet and the World\nWide Web.\n\n\nTwo other important figures in the history of search engine theory\nwho made significant contributions during the pre-Internet era\nwere Gerald Salton and Ted Nelson. Salton, who some consider the\n\u201cfather of modern search technology,\u201d developed the SMART\n(Salton\u2019s Magic Automatic Retriever of Text) information\nretrieval system. And Nelson, who developed hypertext in 1963,\nsignificantly influenced search engine theory through his Project\nXanadu (Wall 2011). Although several years passed before Salton\u2019s\nand Nelson\u2019s contributions could be incorporated into modern\nsearch engines, it is worth noting that some very\n\u201cprimitive\u201d search functions had been built into the\noperating systems for some pre-Internet-era computers. For example,\nHalavais points out that the UNIX operating system supported a search\nutility called \u201cFinger.\u201d Via the Finger command, a UNIX\nuser could search for one or more users who also had active accounts on\na particular UNIX system. To inquire about a UNIX user named\n\u201cJones,\u201d for example, one could simply enter the command\n\u201cFinger Jones\u201d at the user prompt on the command line.\nHowever, this search function was very limited, since the only kind of\ninformation that could be retrieved was information about whether one\nor more users were currently logged into the system and about which\ntime those users logged in/out. But, as Halavais points out, this\nrudimentary search facility also enabled UNIX users to arrange limited\nsocial gatherings\u2014e.g., users could \u201cFinger\u201d one\nanother to set up a time to play tennis after work (provided, of\ncourse, that the users were logged into their UNIX accounts at that\ntime).\n\n\nSome of the conceptual/technological breakthroughs that occurred\nduring the pre-Internet era of search engine development made possible\ntwo kinds of ethical issues examined in Section 3. \nFirst,\nBush\u2019s \u201cassociative indexing\u201d scheme for retrieving\ninformation, as opposed to more traditional cataloging schemes based\non straight-forward inferential rules and techniques, enabled (even if\nunintentionally) some of the kinds of \u201cbias\u201d and\nobjectivity-related concerns affecting users\u2019 search\nresults that we examine in Sections 3.1 and 4.1. \nSecond, the kind of\nsearch function made possible by the UNIX \u201cFinger\u201d utility,\nenabling UNIX users to retrieve information about the availability of\nfellow UNIX users and to acquire information about which times those\nusers logged into and logged out from the system, generated some\nprivacy-and-monitoring-related concerns that are included among the\nethical issues we examine in Sections 3.2 and \n3.3.\n",
