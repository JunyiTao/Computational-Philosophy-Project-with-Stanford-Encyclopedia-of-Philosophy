Objectivity as a Feature of Scientific Communities and Their Practices\n\nThis section addresses various accounts that regard scientific\nobjectivity essentially as a function of social practices in science\nand the social organization of the scientific community. All these\naccounts reject the characterization of scientific objectivity as a\nfunction of correspondence between theories and the world, as a\nfeature of individual reasoning practices, or as pertaining to\nindividual studies and experiments (see also Douglas 2011). Instead,\nthey evaluate the objectivity of a collective of studies, as\nwell as the methods and community practices that structure and guide\nscientific research. More precisely, they adopt a meta-analytic\nperspective for assessing the reliability of scientific results\n(section 5.1), and they construct objectivity from a feminist\nperspective: as an open interchange of mutual criticism, or as being\nanchored in the \u201csituatedness\u201d of our scientific practices\nand the knowledge we gain\n (section 5.2).\n",
