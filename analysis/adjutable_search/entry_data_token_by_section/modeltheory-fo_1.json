    "main_text": "Elementary maps\n2. Elementary maps\n\n\nLet L be a first-order language and let A and B be\nL-structures. Suppose e is a function which takes some\nelements of A to elements of B. We say that\ne is an elementary map if whenever a sequence of\nelements a1, \u2026,\nan in the domain of e satisfy a\nformula\n\u03c6(x1,\u2026,xn)\nof L in A, their images under e satisfy the same\nformula in B; in symbols \nA\n \u22a8\n\u03c6(a1,\u2026,an)\n\u21d2 B\n \u22a8\n\u03c6(e(a1),\u2026,e(an)).\n\n\nWe say that e is an elementary embedding of\nA into B if e is an elementary map and its\ndomain is the whole domain of A. As the name implies,\nelementary embeddings are always embeddings. \n\n\nIf there is an elementary embedding from A to B\nthen A and B are elementarily equivalent. On the\nother hand an embedding between elementarily equivalent structures, or\neven between isomorphic structures, need not be elementary. (For\nexample, writing Z for the abelian group of\nthe integers with signature consisting of 0 and +, the embedding from\nZ to Z that takes\neach integer n to 2n is an embedding, and of course\nZ is isomorphic to itself; but this embedding\nis not elementary, since 1 satisfies the formula\n\u00ac\u2203y(y + y =\nv1), but 2 doesn\u2019t.)\n\n\nWe say that A is an elementary substructure of\nB, and B is an elementary extension of\nA, if A is a substructure of B and the\ninclusion map is an elementary embedding. It\u2019s immediate from the\ndefinitions that an elementary extension of an elementary extension of\nA is again an elementary extension of A.\n\n\nElementary embeddings are natural maps to consider within\nfirst-order model theory. Around 1950 Abraham Robinson was impressed\nthat maps between algebraic structures in general seem hardly ever to\nbe elementary, whereas some important maps (such as embeddings between\ntwo algebraically closed fields, or between two real-closed fields)\nturn out to be elementary. He was also surprised to find that this fact\nabout algebraically closed fields is another way of stating a\ncelebrated theorem called the Hilbert Nullstellensatz. These\nobservations of Robinson have had a huge effect on the development of\nmodel theory. In Robinson\u2019s terminology, a first-order theory is\nmodel-complete if every embedding between models of the theory\nis elementary. This notion has found many uses, and it often appears in\napplications of model theory in algebra.\n\nA notion that is closely related to model-completeness, but should not\nbe confused with it, is elimination of quantifiers.  Suppose L is a\nfirst-order language, T is a theory in L, and \u03a6 is a set of\nformulas of L.  We say that T has elimination of quantifiers down\nto \u03a6 if for every formula\n\u03c6(x1,\u2026,xn)\nof L there is a formula\n\u03c8(x1,\u2026,xn)\nin \u03a6 such that in every model of T, \u03c6 and \u03c8 are satisfied\nby exactly the same n-tuples of elements\n(a1,\u2026,an).  (The\n\u2018method of elimination of quantifiers\u2019 discussed in section 2.2\nof Tarski\u2019s truth definitions) was a\nsyntactic and pre-model-theoretic method for proving elimination of\nquantifiers down to a particular set of formulas.)  A theory is said\nto have quantifier elimination if it has elimination of\nquantifiers down to quantifier-free formulas. \n\n\nThe connection between model-completeness and elimination of\nquantifiers is as follows.  Robinson showed that a theory is\nmodel-complete if and only if it has elimination of quantifiers down\nto existential formulas (i.e. formulas that either are quantifier-free\nor consist of one or more existential quantifiers followed by a\nquantifier-free formula).  So theories that have quantifier\nelimination are model-complete, but the converse need not hold.\nStill, showing that a theory is model-complete is sometimes a useful\nfirst step towards showing that it has quantifier elimination.\n\n\nTo return to elementary embeddings: They have a number of properties\nthat make them useful. We have space for four.\nThe downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem:\n\nSuppose L is a first-order language which has \u03ba formulas,\nA is an L-structure and \u03bb is a cardinal which is at\nleast \u03ba but less than the cardinality of A. Suppose also\nthat X is a set of at most \u03bb elements of A.\nThen A has an elementary substructure which has cardinality\nexactly \u03bb and contains all the elements in\nX.\n\n\nThere is a proof of this in the entry on\n classical logic,\n using Skolem hulls.\nNote that \u03bb must be infinite since every first-order language\nhas infinitely many formulas. \nThe elementary chain theorem:\n\n Suppose that L is a first-order language and A0,\nA1, \u2026 is a sequence (of any length) of\nL-structures such that any structure in the sequence is an elementary\nsubstructure of all the later structures in the sequence. Then there is\na unique smallest L-structure B which contains all the\nstructures in the sequence as substructures; this structure B\nis an elementary extension of all the structures in the sequence. \n\n\nThe elementary amalgamation theorem:\n\n Suppose L is a first-order language, A is an L-structure and\nB, C are two elementary extensions of A.\nThen there are an elementary extension D of B and an\nelementary embedding e of C into D such that\n(i) for each element a of A, e(a) =\na, and (ii) if c is an element of C but not\nof A, then e(c) is not in B.\n\n\n\nThe elementary amalgamation theorem is a consequence of the\ncompactness theorem in the next section. \nThe upward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem:\n\n Suppose L is a first-order language which has \u03ba formulas,\nA is an L-structure whose cardinality is an infinite cardinal\n\u03bc, and \u03bb is a cardinal which is at least as great as both\n\u03ba and \u03bc. Then A has an elementary extension whose\ncardinality is \u03bb.\n\n\nThis also follows from the compactness theorem, as shown in the entry on\n classical logic.\n The name of the theorem\nis a little unfortunate, since the theorem was first proved by Tarski,\nand Skolem didn\u2019t even believe it (because he didn\u2019t believe in\nuncountable cardinals). \n\n\nThere is another proof using the elementary amalgamation theorem and\nthe elementary chain theorem. One can show that the\nstructure A has a proper elementary\nextension A\u2032.  (There is a proof of this using the\ncompactness theorem and the diagram lemma \u2014 see 3.1 and 3.2\nbelow; another proof is by ultrapowers \u2014 see 4.1 below.)  Now\nuse A\u2032 and again A\u2032 for the\nstructures B and C in the elementary amalgamation\ntheorem. Then D as in the theorem is an elementary extension\nof A, and by (ii) in the theorem, it must contain elements\nthat are not in A\u2032, so that it is a proper elementary\nextension. Repeat to get a proper elementary extension of D,\nand so on until you have an infinite elementary chain. Use the\nelementary chain theorem to find an elementary extension of A\nthat sits on top of this chain. Keep repeating these moves until you\nhave an elementary extension of\nA that has cardinality at least \u03bb. Then if necessary\nuse the downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem to pull the cardinality down\nto exactly \u03bb. This kind of argument is very common in\nfirst-order model theory.  By careful choice of the amalgams at the steps in the\nconstruction, we can often ensure that the top structure has further properties\nthat we might want (such as saturation, see 4.2 below).\n",
