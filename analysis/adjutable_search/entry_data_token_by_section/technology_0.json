    "main_text": "Historical Developments || The Greeks\n1.1 The Greeks\n\nPhilosophical reflection on technology is about as old as philosophy\nitself. Our oldest testimony is from ancient Greece. There are four\nprominent themes. One early theme is the thesis that technology learns\nfrom or imitates nature (Plato, Laws X 899a ff.). According\nto Democritus, for example, house-building and weaving were first\ninvented by imitating swallows and spiders building their nests and\nnets, respectively (Diels 1903 and Freeman 1948: 154). Perhaps the\noldest extant source for the exemplary role of nature is Heraclitus\n(Diels 1903 and Freeman 1948: 112). Aristotle referred to this\ntradition by repeating Democritus\u2019 examples, but he did not\nmaintain that technology can only imitate nature: \u201cgenerally\ntechn\u00e8 in some cases completes what nature cannot\nbring to a finish, and in others imitates nature\u201d\n(Physics II.8, 199a15; see also Physics II.2, and\nsee Schummer 2001 and this encyclopedia\u2019s entry on\n episteme and techne\n for discussion).\n\nA second theme is the thesis that there is a fundamental ontological\ndistinction between natural things and artifacts. According to\nAristotle (Physics II.1), the former have their principles of\ngeneration and motion inside, whereas the latter, insofar as they are\nartifacts, are generated only by outward causes, namely human aims and\nforms in the human soul. Natural products (animals and their parts,\nplants, and the four elements) move, grow, change, and reproduce\nthemselves by inner final causes; they are driven by purposes of\nnature. Artifacts, on the other hand, cannot reproduce themselves.\nWithout human care and intervention, they vanish after some time by\nlosing their artificial forms and decomposing into (natural)\nmaterials. For instance, if a wooden bed is buried, it decomposes to\nearth or changes back into its botanical nature by putting forth a\nshoot.\n\nThe thesis that there is a fundamental difference between man-made\nproducts and natural substances has had a long-lasting influence. In\nthe Middle Ages, Avicenna criticized alchemy on the ground that it can\nnever produce \u2018genuine\u2019 substances (Briffault 1930: 147).\nEven today, some still maintain that there is a difference between,\nfor example, natural and synthetic vitamin C. The modern discussion of\nthis theme is taken up in\n Section 2.5.\n\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine of the four causes\u2014material, formal,\nefficient and final\u2014can be regarded as a third early\ncontribution to the philosophy of technology. Aristotle explained this\ndoctrine by referring to technical artifacts such as houses and\nstatues (Physics II.3). The four causes are still very much\npresent in modern discussions related to the metaphysics of artifacts.\nDiscussions of the notion of function, for example, focus on its\ninherent teleological or \u2018final\u2019 character and the\ndifficulties this presents to its use in biology. And the notorious\ncase of the ship of Theseus\u2014see this encyclopedia\u2019s\nentries on\n material constitution,\n identity over time,\n relative identity,\n and\n sortals\u2014was\n introduced in modern philosophy by Hobbes as showing a conflict\nbetween unity of matter and unity of form as principles of\nindividuation. This conflict is seen by many as characteristic of\nartifacts. David Wiggins (1980: 89) takes it even to be the defining\ncharacteristic of artifacts.\n\nA fourth point that deserves mentioning is the extensive employment of\ntechnological images by Plato and Aristotle. In his Timaeus,\nPlato described the world as the work of an Artisan, the Demiurge. His\naccount of the details of creation is full of images drawn from\ncarpentry, weaving, ceramics, metallurgy, and agricultural technology.\nAristotle used comparisons drawn from the arts and crafts to\nillustrate how final causes are at work in natural processes. Despite\ntheir negative appreciation of the life led by artisans, who they\nconsidered too much occupied by the concerns of their profession and\nthe need to earn a living to qualify as free individuals, both Plato\nand Aristotle found technological imagery indispensable for expressing\ntheir belief in the rational design of the universe (Lloyd 1973:\n61).\n",
