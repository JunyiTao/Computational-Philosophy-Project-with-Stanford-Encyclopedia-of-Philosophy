The obvious place to look for\nsuch a presentation is in the so-called \u201cPhysical\nInterlude\u201d (hereinafter PI) following IIp13s, in which Spinoza\ngives his most extended and detailed discussion of his own views about\nthe nature of bodies and their principles of distinction and\nindividuation. But the PI seems to offer little\n help.[6]\n First, at least at the time of letter 83, Spinoza thought that what\nwas needed to help explain variety in matter was an appeal to an\nattribute that expresses infinite and eternal essence. Yet the text of\nthe PI makes no appeal to the infinitude, eternality or expressive\nnature of extension or any other attribute. More importantly, at least\non the face of it, the account of the individuation of bodies\npresented in the PI moves in much the same futile circle as that\noffered by Descartes. That motion serves to individuate bodies is\nquite explicit in PIDL1: \u201cBodies are distinguished from one\nanother by reason of motion and rest, speed and slowness.\u201d PID5\ngoes on to define \u201cbody, or Individual\u201d, in terms of\nmotion, and in a way that presupposes a plurality of bodies:\n\nWhen a number of bodies, whether of the same or of different size, are\nso constrained by other bodies that they lie upon one another, or, if\nthey so move, whether with the same degree or different degrees of\nspeed, that they communicate their motions to each other in a certain\nfixed manner, we shall say that those bodies are united with one\nanother and that they all together compose one body or Individual,\nwhich is distinguished from the others by this union of bodies.\n\n\nSince \u201cbody or individual\u201d is here defined in terms of the\nrelations among a plurality of bodies, PID5, to the extent it is meant\nto cover all bodies, is at best an inductive step of an inductive\ndefinition of body. The obvious candidates for the base case are what\nSpinoza calls \u201cthe simplest bodies\u201d, but the description\nand differentiation of these is likewise in terms of their motion and\nrest. Indeed, they \u201care distinguished from one another\nonly by motion and rest\u201d (PIL7s, italics\nadded).[7]\nSpinoza, then, appears to\naccord with Descartes in taking bodies to be distinguished by their\nrespective motion and rest. But motion and rest seem in the first\ninstance to be determinations of bodies. So the motion of\nbodies seems to presuppose a prior ground of their individuation.\n\nCommentators have tried various strategies for finessing the apparent\ncircularity in the PI's account of the diversity in matter. Klever\n(1988) urges that the key to understanding Spinoza's concept of matter\nis to see that physical nature is not to be conceived as an infinite\nextended expanse that somehow is put into motion, but as,\nfundamentally, matter-in-motion (\u201cmoles in\nmotu\u201d). According to Klever, \u201cmovement and rest in\nextension are examples of immediate production by God, whereas the\nface of the universe with its infinite variations is an example of the\nmediate effects, which are a product of movement in its turn.\u201d\nOn this interpretation, Spinoza, rather than seeing motion as a\nreceived quality of matter, conceives \u201cmatter as consequence of\nmotion\u201d (Klever 1988, p. 171). This reading arguably answers\nSpinoza's call to explain the variety in matter through an attribute\nthat expresses eternal and infinite essence. If God creates extended\nmatter, and then, in a separate act, sets it in motion, the attribute\nof Extension would not suffice as an eternal expression of infinite\nessence, since it requires God's additional action in its expression\nof power.\n",
