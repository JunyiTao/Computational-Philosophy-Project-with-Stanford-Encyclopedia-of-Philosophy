According to\nthem, a universe with different laws, constants, and boundary\nconditions would almost certainly not give rise to any form\nof life. A common worry about such considerations is that they are\nill-founded due to lack of a widely accepted definition of\n\u201clife\u201d. Another worry is that we may seriously\nunderestimate life\u2019s propensity to appear under different laws,\nconstants, and boundary conditions because we are biased to assume\nthat all possible kinds of life will resemble life as we know it. A\njoint response to both worries is that, according to the fine-tuning\nconsiderations, universes with different laws, constants, and boundary\nconditions would typically give rise to much less structure and\ncomplexity, which would seem to make them life-hostile, irrespective\nof how exactly one defines \u201clife\u201d (Lewis & Barnes\n2016: 255\u2013274).\n\nVictor Stenger (2011) is extremely critical of considerations\naccording to which the laws, constants, and boundary conditions of our\nuniverse are fine-tuned. According to Stenger, the form of the laws of\nnature is fixed by the reasonable\u2014very weak\u2014requirement\nthat they be \u201cpoint-of-view-invariant\u201d in that, as he\nclaims, the laws \u201cwill be the same in any universe where no\nspecial point of view is present\u201d (p. 91). Luke Barnes\ncriticizes this claim (2012: sect. 4.1), arguing that it relies on\nconfusingly identifying point-of-view-invariance with non-trivial\nsymmetry properties that the laws in our universe happen to exhibit.\nNotably, as Barnes emphasizes, neither general relativity nor the\nStandard Model of elementary particle physics are without conceptually\nviable, though perhaps empirically disfavoured, alternatives.\n\nA further criticism by Stenger is that considerations according to\nwhich the conditions in our universe are fine-tuned for life routinely\nfail to consider the consequences of varying more than one parameter\nat a time. In response to this criticism, Barnes (2012: sect. 4.2)\ngives an overview of various studies such as Barr and Khan 2007 and\nTegmark et al. 2006 that explore the complete parameter space of\n(segments of) the Standard Model and arrives at the conclusion that\nthe life-permitting range in multidimensional parameter space is\nlikely very small.\n\nFred Adams (2019) cautions against claims that the universe is\nextremely fine-tuned for life. According to him, the range of\nparameters for which the universe would have been habitable is quite\nconsiderable. In addition, as he sees it, the universe could have been\nmore, rather than less, life-friendly. Notably, if the vacuum energy\ndensity had been smaller, the primordial fluctuations (quantified by\nQ) had been larger, the baryon-to-photon ratio had been larger, the\nstrong force had been slightly stronger, and gravity slightly weaker,\nthere might have been more opportunities for life to develop (Adams\n2019: sect. 10.3). If Adams is right, our universe may just be\ngarden-variety habitable rather than maximally life-supporting.\n",
