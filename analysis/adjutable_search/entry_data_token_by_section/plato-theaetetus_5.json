First Definition (D1): \u201cKnowledge is Perception\u201d: 151e\u2013187a\n\n\nBetween Stephanus pages 151 and 187, and leaving aside the Digression,\n172\u2013177 (section 6d), 31 pages of close and complex argument state,\ndiscuss, and eventually refute the first of Theaetetus\u2019 three serious\nattempts at a definition of knowledge (D1):\n\u201cKnowledge is perception.\u201d\n\n\nAs before, there are two main alternative readings of 151\u2013187: the\nUnitarian and the Revisionist. On the Unitarian reading, Plato\u2019s\npurpose is to salvage as much as possible of the theories of\nProtagoras and Heracleitus (each respectfully described as ou\nphaulon: 151e8, 152d2). Plato\u2019s strategy is to show that these\ntheories have their own distinctive area of application, the\nperceptible or sensible world, within which they are true. However,\nthe sensible world is not the whole world, and so these theories are\nnot the whole truth. We get absurdities if we try to take them as\nunrestrictedly true. To avoid these absurdities it is necessary to\nposit the intelligible world (the world of the Forms)\nalongside the sensible world (the world of perception). When\nthis is done, Platonism subsumes the theories of Protagoras and\nHeracleitus as partial truths. On this reading, the strategy of the\ndiscussion of D1 is to transcend Protagoras and\nHeracleitus: to explain their views by showing how they are, not the\ntruth, but parts of a larger truth. In the process the discussion\nreveals logical pressures that may push us towards the two-worlds\nPlatonism that many readers, e.g., Ross and Cornford, find in the\nRepublic and Timaeus.\n\n\nOn the Revisionist reading, Plato\u2019s purpose is to refute the theories\nof Protagoras and Heracleitus. He thinks that the absurdities those\ntheories give rise to, come not from trying to take the theories as\nunrestrictedly true, but from trying to take them as true\nat all, even of the sensible world. Anyone who tries to take\nseriously the thesis that knowledge is perception has to adopt\ntheories of knowledge and perception like Protagoras\u2019 and\nHeracleitus\u2019. But their theories are untenable. By modus\ntollens this shows that D1 itself is\nuntenable. On this reading, the strategy of the discussion of\nD1 is to move us towards the view that sensible\nphenomena have to fall under the same general metaphysical theory as\nintelligible phenomena.\n\n\nThis outline of the two main alternatives for 151\u2013187 shows how\nstrategic and tactical issues of Plato interpretation interlock. For\ninstance, the outline shows how important it is for an overall\nunderstanding of the Theaetetus to have a view on the\nfollowing questions of detail (more about them later): \n\nAt 156a\u2013157c, is Socrates just reporting, or also endorsing, a\nHeracleitean flux theory of perception?\nWhat is the date of the Timaeus, which seems (28\u201329, 45b\u201346c,\n49e) to present a very similar theory of perception to that found in\nTheaetetus 156\u20137?\nWhat does Plato take to be the logical relations between the three\npositions under discussion in 151\u2013184 (D1,\nProtagoras\u2019 theory, and Heracleitus\u2019 theory)? The closer he takes them\nto be, the more support that seems to give to the Revisionist view\nthat the whole of 151\u2013187 is one gigantic modus tollens. The\nmore separate they are, the better for those versions of Unitarianism\nthat suggest that Plato wants to pick and choose among the positions\noffered in 151\u2013187.\n\n\n     \nSo much for the overall structure of 151\u2013187; now for the parts.\n",
