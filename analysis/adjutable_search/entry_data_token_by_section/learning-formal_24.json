    "main_text": "Reliable Learning for Statistical Hypotheses\n7. Other Approaches: Categorical vs. Hypothetical Imperatives\n\nKant distinguished between categorical imperatives that one ought to\nfollow regardless of one\u2019s personal aim and circumstances, and\nhypothetical imperatives that direct us to employ our means towards\nour chosen end. One way to think of learning theory is as the study of\nhypothetical imperatives for empirical inquiry. Many epistemologists\nhave proposed various categorical imperatives for inductive inquiry,\nfor example in the form of an \u201cinductive logic\u201d or norms\nof \u201cepistemic rationality\u201d. In principle, there are three\npossible relationships between hypothetical and categorical\nimperatives for empirical inquiry.\n\n1. The categorical imperative will lead an inquirer to obtain his\ncognitive goals. In that case means-ends analysis vindicates\nthe categorical imperative. For example, when faced with a simple\nuniversal generalization such as \u201call ravens are black\u201d,\nwe saw above that following the Popperian recipe of adopting the\nfalsifiable generalization and sticking to it until a counterexample\nappears leads to a reliable method.\n\n2. The categorical imperative may prevent an inquirer from\nachieving his aims. In that case the categorical imperative\nrestricts the scope of inquiry. For example, in the case of\nthe two alternative generalizations with exceptions, the principle of\nmaintaining a universal generalization until it is falsified leads to\nan unreliable method (cf. [Kelly 1996, Ch. 9.4]).\n\n3. Some methods meet both the categorical imperative and the\ngoals of inquiry, and others don\u2019t. Then we may take the best of\nboth worlds and choose those methods that attain the goals of inquiry\nand satisfy categorical imperatives. (See the further discussion in\nthis section.)\n\nFor a proposed norm of inquiry, we can apply means-ends analysis to\nask whether the norm helps or hinders the aims of inquiry. This was\nthe spirit of Putnam\u2019s critique of Carnap\u2019s confirmation\nfunctions [Putnam 1963]: the thrust of his essay was that\nCarnap\u2019s methods were not as reliable in detecting general\npatterns as other methods would be. More recently, learning theorists\nhave investigated the power of Bayesian conditioning (see the entry on\n Bayesian epistemology).\n John Earman has conjectured that if there is any reliable method for\na given problem, then there is a reliable method that proceeds by\nBayesian updating [Earman 1992, Ch.9, Sec.6]. Cory Juhl [1997]\nprovided a partial confirmation of Earman\u2019s conjecture: He\nproved that it holds when there are only two potential evidence items\n(e.g., \u201cemerald is green\u201d vs. \u201cemerald is\nblue\u201d). The general case is still open.\n\nEpistemic conservatism is a methodological norm that has been\nprominent in philosophy at least since Quine\u2019s notion of\n\u201cminimal mutilation\u201d of our beliefs [1951]. One version of\nepistemic conservatism, as we saw above, holds that inquiry should\nseek stable belief. Another formulation, closer to Quine\u2019s, is\nthe general precept that belief changes in light of new evidence\nshould be minimal. Fairly recent work in philosophical logic has\nproposed a number of criteria for minimal belief change known\nas the AGM axioms [G\u00e4rdenfors 1988]. Learning theorists have\nshown that whenever there is a reliable method for investigating an\nempirical question, there is one that proceeds via minimal changes (as\ndefined by the AGM postulates). The properties of reliable inquiry\nwith minimal belief changes are investigated in [Martin and Osherson\n1998, Kelly 1999, Baltag et al. 2011, Baltag et al. 2015].\n\nMuch of computational learning theory focuses on inquirers with\nbounded rationality, that is, agents with cognitive\nlimitations such as a finite memory or bounded computational\ncapacities. Many categorical norms that do not interfere with\nempirical success for logically omniscient agents nonetheless limit\nthe scope of cognitively bounded agents. For example, consider the\nnorm of consistency: Believe that a hypothesis is false as soon as the\nevidence is logically inconsistent with it. The consistency principle\nis part of both Bayesian confirmation theory and AGM belief revision.\nKelly and Schulte [1995] show that consistency prevents even agents\nwith infinitely uncomputable cognitive powers from reliably assessing\ncertain hypotheses. The moral is that if a theory is sufficiently\ncomplex, agents who are not logically omniscient may be unable to\ndetermine immediately whether a given piece of evidence is consistent\nwith the theory, and need to collect more data to detect the\ninconsistency. But the consistency principle\u2014and a fortiori,\nBayesian updating and AGM belief revision\u2014 do not acknowledge\nthe usefulness of \u201cwait and see more\u201d as a scientific\nstrategy.\n\nMore reflection on these and other philosophical issues in means-ends\nepistemology can be found in sources such as Huber [2018], [Glymour\n1991], [Kelly 1996, Chs. 2,3], [Glymour and Kelly 1992], [Kelly et\nal. 1997], [Glymour 1994], [Bub 1994]. Of particular interest in\nthe philosophy of science may be learning-theoretic models that\naccommodate historicist and relativist conceptions of inquiry, chiefly\nby expanding the notion of an inductive method so that methods may\nactively select paradigms for inquiry; for more details on this topic,\nsee [Kelly 2000, Kelly 1996, Ch.13]. Booklength introductions to the\nmathematics of learning theory are [Kelly 1996, Martin and Osherson\n1998, Jain et al. 1999]. \u201cInduction, Algorithmic Learning Theory\nand Philosophy\u201d is a recent collection of writings on learning\ntheory [Friend et al. 2007]. Contributions include introductory papers\n(Harizanov, Schulte), mathematical advances (Martin, Sharma, Stephan,\nKalantari), philosophical reflections on the strengths and\nimplications of learning theory (Glymour, Larvor, Friend),\napplications of the theory to philosophical problems (Kelly), and a\ndiscussion of learning-theoretic thinking in the history of philosophy\n(Goethe).\nSupplementary Document: Basic Formal Definitions\n",
