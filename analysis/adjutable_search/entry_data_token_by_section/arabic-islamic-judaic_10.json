Christian Arabic Authors\n\nSome Christian Arabic philosophers working in the 9th and\n10th centuries give evidence of having exerted their\n\u2019influence\u2019 upon Medieval Judaic thought. The first of\nthem was Abd al-Masih Ibn Na\u2018ima al-Himsi, a collaborator of\nal-Kindi: his famous Arabic philosophical work, the \u201cshorter\nversion\u201d of the Theology of Aristotle (a reworking of\nparts of books four, five, and six of Plotinus\u2019\nEnneads), as well as other Arabic texts connected to it (the\nSayings of the Greek Sage, the De causis and\npseudo-Empedocles\u2019 Book of the Five Substances), might\nhave exerted their direct influence over Solomon Ibn Gabirol, as\nsuggested by Jacques Schlanger (see Schlanger 1968, 52\u2013109).\nMoreover, a \u201clonger version\u201d of the Theology of\nAristotle might have been written by a Judaeo-Arabic scholar in\n10th- or 11th-century Egypt: it was apparently\nquoted by Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera (Langermann 1999), who in any case\nknew and employed also the \u201cshorter version\u201d of it (Fenton\n1992), and was translated into Hebrew in the 16th century\nby Moses Arovas (about this translation, now lost, see Fenton 1986).\nFalaquera wrote also a summary of the Book of the Five\nSubstances (edited in Kaufmann 1899, 17\u201337), which proves\nto be useful for reconstructing the contents of the lost original text\n(see the French translation by Gy\u0151ngy Heged\u00fcs in De Smet\n1998, 208\u2013231). The main role in influencing Jewish philosophy\nwas played by the De causis, an Arabic work mixing up some\naspects of Plotinus\u2019 and Proclus\u2019 theology and probably\nwritten in the 9th century in al-Kindi\u2019s circle by a\nstill unidentified author (a Christian-Arabic one?): it was translated\ninto Hebrew four times in the period 1260\u20131480, and exerted its\n\u2018influence\u2019 over a number of Jewish philosophers (see\nRothschild 1985, 1994).\n\nAlso a minor philosophical work by a 9th-century Christian\nArabic author, the Book On the Difference between Spirit and\nSoul (Kitab al-fasl bayna l-ruh wa-l-nafs), was\ntranslated into Hebrew in the Middle Ages (Steinschneider 1893, 289):\nit was quoted by some Medieval Jewish authors. Finally, in the first\nhalf of the 10th century, in the circle of\nal-Farabi\u2019s followers there was an \u201cexchange of\nopinions\u201d about some metaphysical doctrines: it involved the\nChristian Arabic philosopher Yahya Ibn \u2018Adi and two minor Jewish\nscholars, Ibn Abi Sa\u2018id al-Mawsili and Bishr ibn Sam\u2018an\nibn \u2018Irs, as shown by Shlomo Pines (Pines 1955).\n",
