Methodology\n\nQ\u00fbnaw\u00ee differentiates Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s\nposition from that of falsafa and scholastic theology (Kalam)\nby calling it mashrab al-tahq\u00eeq, \u201cthe school of\nrealization\u201d. Tahq\u00eeq is indeed the cornerstone of\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s vast corpus, so it is important to have\na sense of what it means. The word is derived from the same root as\nhaqq and haq\u00eeqa, key terms in all the\nsciences. Haqq means true, real, right, worthy, and\nappropriate (in modern times, it is used to speak of human\n\u201crights\u201d); haq\u00eeqa means reality and truth.\nThe Koran uses haqq, the conceptual opposite of\nb\u00e2til (false, vain, unreal, inappropriate), in a\nvariety of senses, not least as a divine name, \u201cthe Real, the\nTrue\u201d, and to designate the content of revelation (the Koran and\nearlier scriptures). Haq\u00eeqa is not a Koranic term, but\nit was used in the Hadith literature and given special attention in\nphilosophy. Tahq\u00eeq or \u201crealization\u201d means\nto speak, affirm, and actualize haqq and\nhaq\u00eeqa\u2014truth, reality, rightness,\nappropriateness. Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee finds its role in human\nbecoming encapsulated in the Prophet\u2019s saying, \u201cEverything\nhas a haqq, so give to each that has a haqq its\nhaqq\u201d. In other words, everything in the universe,\nsociety, and the soul has a rightness and an appropriateness, and the\nhuman task vis-\u00e0-vis each thing is to act rightly and\nappropriately; or, everything has rights, and people have the\nresponsibility (that is, the haqq \u201cagainst them\u201d,\n\u2018alayhim) to observe those rights.\n\nAnother hadith explains that the primary haqq, upon which all\nother haqqs are based, is that \u201cThere is no god but\nGod\u201d, which is to say that there is nothing truly real but the\nReal, there is nothing truly right but the Right. In Islamic theology,\nunderstanding this notion is called tawh\u00eed or\n\u201cthe acknowledgement of [divine] unity\u201d and is considered\nthe first of the three principles of faith; tawh\u00eed also\nunderlies the standpoints of the philosophers, even if some of them\nseldom spoke of God per se, preferring terms like the First, the Good,\nand the Necessary. This particular hadith tells us that God\u2019s\nhaqq against people (that is, their responsibility toward\nhim) is for them to acknowledge tawh\u00eed, and, if they do\nso, their right against God (his responsibility toward them) is for\nthem to receive everlasting happiness,\nsa\u2018\u00e2da\u2014the term philosophers used to\ntranslate eudaimonia.\n\nFrom earliest times, Muslim philosophers recognized that\nhaqq\u2014truth, reality, rightness\u2014was basic to the\nquest for wisdom and the happiness of the soul. Already\nal-Kind\u00ee, at the beginning of his most famous work, On First\nPhilosophy, writes that the goal of the philosopher is to reach\nhaqq and to practice haqq. Scholars translate the\nword here and in similar contexts as \u201ctruth\u201d, but doing so\nsuggests that the issue was logical and epistemological, when in fact\nit was ontological and existential; for the philosophers, the goal of\nthe quest for wisdom was transformation of the soul, and that could\nnot be achieved simply by logic and argumentation.\nAl-Kind\u00ee\u2019s statement is in fact an early definition of\ntahq\u00eeq, and the term itself became common in\nphilosophical texts, though it seldom has the same urgency that it has\nin Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s works. For him it is the guiding\nprinciple of all knowledge and activity and the highest goal to which\na human soul can aspire. It means knowing the truth and reality of the\ncosmos, the soul, and human affairs on the basis of the Supreme\nReality, al-Haqq; knowing the Supreme Reality inasmuch as it\nreveals itself in the haqqs of all things; and acting in\nkeeping with these haqqs at every moment and in every\nsituation. In short, the \u201crealizers\u201d\n(muhaqqiq\u00fbn) are those who fully actualize the\nspiritual, cosmic, and divine potential of the soul (Chittick 2005,\nchap. 5).\n\nSome of the implications of tahq\u00eeq can be understood\nwhen it is contrasted with its conceptual opposite,\ntaql\u00eed, which means imitation or following authority.\nKnowledge can be divided into two sorts, which in Arabic were often\ncalled naql\u00ee, transmitted, and\n\u2018aql\u00ee, intellectual; or\nhus\u00fbl\u00ee, acquired, and\nhud\u00fbr\u00ee, presential. Transmitted knowledge is\neverything that one can learn only by imitating others, like language,\nculture, scripture, history, law, and science. Intellectual knowledge\nis what one comes to know by realizing its truth within oneself, like\nmathematics and metaphysics, even if these are initially learned by\nimitation. Mull\u00e2 Sadr\u00e2 calls intellectual knowledge\n\u201cnon-instrumental\u201d (al-ghayr al-\u00e2l\u00ee),\nbecause it accrues to the soul not by the instruments of sense\nperception, imagination, and rational argumentation, but by the\nsoul\u2019s conformity with reason or intelligence\n(\u2018aql), which, in its fullest reality, is nothing but\nthe shining light of the Real. In short, Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee, like\nmany of the Islamic philosophers, holds that real knowledge cannot\ncome from imitating others, but must be discovered by realization,\nwhich is the actualization of the soul\u2019s potential. Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee differs from most philosophers in maintaining that\nfull realization can only be achieved by following in the footsteps of\nthe prophets.\n",
