One\u2019s answer to this question\nobviously depends on how one defines the terms used in the question.\nIf critical thinking is conceived broadly to cover any careful\nthinking about any topic for any purpose, then problem solving and\ndecision making will be kinds of critical thinking, if they are done\ncarefully. Historically, \u2018critical thinking\u2019 and\n\u2018problem solving\u2019 were two names for the same thing. If\ncritical thinking is conceived more narrowly as consisting solely of\nappraisal of intellectual products, then it will be disjoint with\nproblem solving and decision making, which are constructive.\n\nBloom\u2019s taxonomy of educational objectives used the phrase\n\u201cintellectual abilities and skills\u201d for what had been\nlabeled \u201ccritical thinking\u201d by some, \u201creflective\nthinking\u201d by Dewey and others, and \u201cproblem solving\u201d\nby still others (Bloom et al. 1956: 38). Thus, the so-called\n\u201chigher-order thinking skills\u201d at the taxonomy\u2019s top\nlevels of analysis, synthesis and evaluation are just critical\nthinking skills, although they do not come with general criteria for\ntheir assessment (Ennis 1981b). The revised version of Bloom\u2019s\ntaxonomy (Anderson et al. 2001) likewise treats critical thinking as\ncutting across those types of cognitive process that involve more than\nremembering (Anderson et al. 2001: 269\u2013270). For details, see\nthe\n Supplement on History.\n\nAs to creative thinking, it overlaps with critical thinking (Bailin\n1987, 1988). Thinking about the explanation of some phenomenon or\nevent, as in\n Ferryboat,\n requires creative imagination in constructing plausible explanatory\nhypotheses. Likewise, thinking about a policy question, as in\n Candidate,\n requires creativity in coming up with options. Conversely, creativity\nin any field needs to be balanced by critical appraisal of the draft\npainting or novel or mathematical theory.\n",
