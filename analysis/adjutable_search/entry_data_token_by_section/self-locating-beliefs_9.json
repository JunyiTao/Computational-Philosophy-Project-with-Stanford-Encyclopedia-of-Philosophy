    "main_text": "Theoretical Responses || Other options\n3.3 Other options\n\nThere are other theoretical options in the literature. See for example\nthose offered in Recanati (2007), Higginbotham (1995, 2010), Chisholm\n(1981), and Stalnaker (2008). But the Lewis/Perry contrast, where\nLewis responds by complicating the objects of belief, and Perry\nresponds by complicating the relations between believers and objects\nof belief, provides a useful classificatory scheme. Like Lewis,\nRecanati and Chisholm propose a more complicated account of content\nthan that of the Simple Picture, though their proposed alternatives\ndiffer. Higginbotham\u2019s token reflexive account is, we think,\nusefully grouped with Perry\u2019s view as accounting for\nself-locating phenomena with the mechanisms by which believers are\nrelated to the objects of belief; though again, the theoretically\nload-bearing features of the relations are different.\nStalnaker\u2019s (2008) account also likely belongs with\nPerry\u2019s. Rather than going into detail about other accounts of\nself-locating belief, we refer the interested reader to the works\ncited above.\n",
