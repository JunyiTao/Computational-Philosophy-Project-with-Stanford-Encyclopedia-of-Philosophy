    "main_text": "Neuroscience and Psychosemantics\n3. Neuroscience and Psychosemantics\n\nDeveloping and defending theories of content is a central topic in\ncontemporary philosophy of mind. A common desideratum in this debate\nis a theory of cognitive representation consistent with a physical or\nnaturalistic ontology. We\u2019ll here describe a few contributions\nneurophilosophers have made to this project.\n\nWhen one perceives or remembers that he is out of coffee, his brain\nstate possesses intentionality or \u201caboutness\u201d. The percept\nor memory is about one\u2019s being out of coffee; it represents one\nas being out of coffee. The representational state has content. A\npsychosemantics seeks to explain what it is for a representational\nstate to be about something, to provide an account of how states and\nevents can have specific representational content. A physicalist\npsychosemantics seeks to do this using resources of the physical\nsciences exclusively. Neurophilosophers have contributed to two types\nof physicalist psychosemantics: the Functional Role approach and the\nInformational approach. For a description of these and other theories\nof mental content, see the entries on\n causal theories of mental content,\n mental representation, and\n teleological theories of mental content.\n\nThe core claim of a functional role semantics is that a representation\nhas its specific content in virtue of relations it bears to other\nrepresentations. Its paradigm application is to concepts of\ntruth-functional logic, like the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d or\ndisjunctive \u201cor\u201d. A physical event instantiates the\n\u201cand\u201d function just in case it maps two true inputs onto a\nsingle true output. Thus it is the relations an expression bears to\nothers that give it the semantic content of \u201cand\u201d.\nProponents of functional role semantics propose similar analyses for\nthe content of all representations (Block 1995). A physical event\nrepresents birds, for example, if it bears the right relations to\nevents representing feathers and others representing beaks. By\ncontrast, informational semantics ascribe content to a state depending\nupon the causal relations obtaining between the state and the object\nit represents. A physical state represents birds, for example, just in\ncase an appropriate causal relation obtains between it and birds. At\nthe heart of informational semantics is a causal account of\ninformation (Dretske 1981, 1988). Red spots on a face carry the\ninformation that one has measles because the red spots are caused by\nthe measles virus. A common criticism of informational semantics holds\nthat mere causal covariation is insufficient for representation, since\ninformation (in the causal sense) is by definition always veridical\nwhile representations can misrepresent. A popular solution to this\nchallenge invokes a teleological analysis of \u201cfunction\u201d. A\nbrain state represents X by virtue of having the function of\ncarrying information about being caused by X (Dretske 1988).\nThese two approaches do not exhaust the popular options for a\npsychosemantics, but are the ones to which neurophilosophers have most\ncontributed.\n\nPaul Churchland\u2019s allegiance to functional role semantics goes\nback to his earliest views about the semantics of terms in a language.\nIn his (1979) book, he insisted that the semantic identity (content)\nof a term derives from its place in the network of sentences of the\nentire language. The functional economies envisioned by early\nfunctional role semanticists were networks with nodes corresponding to\nthe objects and properties denoted by expressions in a language. Thus\none node, appropriately connected, might represent birds, another\nfeathers, and another beaks. Activation of one of these would tend to\nspread activation to the others. As \u201cconnectionist\u201d neural\nnetwork modeling developed (as discussed in the previous section\nabove), alternatives arose to this one-representation-per-node\n\u201clocalist\u201d approach. By the time Churchland (1989)\nprovided a neuroscientific elaboration of functional role semantics\nfor cognitive representations generally, he too had abandoned the\n\u201clocalist\u201d interpretation. Instead, he offered a\n\u201cstate-space semantics\u201d.\n\nWe saw in the previous section how (vector) state spaces provide an\ninterpretation for activity patterns in neural networks, both\nbiological and artificial. A state-space semantics for cognitive\nrepresentations is a species of a functional role semantics because\nthe individuation of a particular state depends upon the relations\nobtaining between it and other states. A representation is a point in\nan appropriate state space, and points (or subvolumes) in a space are\nindividuated by their relations to other points (locations,\ngeometrical proximity). Paul Churchland (1989, 1995) illustrated a\nstate-space semantics for neural states by appealing to sensory\nsystems. One popular theory in sensory neuroscience of how the brain\ncodes for sensory qualities (like color) is the opponent process\naccount (Hardin 1988). Churchland (1995) describes a\nthree-dimensional activation vector state-space in which every color\nperceivable by humans is represented as a point (or subvolume). Each\ndimension corresponds to activity rates in one of three classes of\nphotoreceptors present in the human retina and their efferent paths:\nthe red-green opponent pathway, yellow-blue opponent pathway, and\nblack-white (contrast) opponent pathway. Photons striking the retina\nare transduced by photoreceptors, producing an activity rate in each\nof the segregated pathways. A represented color is hence a triplet of\nneuronal activation frequency rates. As an illustration, consider\nagain\n Figure 3.\n Each dimension in that three-dimensional space will represent average\nfrequency of action potentials in the axons of one class of ganglion\ncells projecting out of the retina. Each color perceivable by humans\nwill be a region of that space. For example, an orange stimulus\nproduces a relatively low level of activity in both the red-green and\nyellow-blue opponent pathways (x-axis and y-axis,\nrespectively), and middle-range activity in the black-white (contrast)\nopponent pathway (z-axis). Pink stimuli, on the other hand,\nproduce low activity in the red-green opponent pathway, middle-range\nactivity in the yellow-blue opponent pathway, and high activity in the\nblack-white (contrast) opponent\n pathway.[7]\n The location of each color in the space generates a \u201ccolor\nsolid\u201d. Location on the solid, and geometrical proximity between\nthese locations, reflect structural similarities between the perceived\ncolors. Human gustatory representations are points in a\nfour-dimensional state space, with each dimension coding for activity\nrates generated by gustatory stimuli in each type of taste receptor\n(sweet, salty, sour, and bitter) and their segregated efferent\npathways. When implemented in a neural network with structural\nresources, and hence computational resources as vast as the human\nbrain, the state space approach to psychosemantics generates a theory\nof content for a huge number of cognitive\n states.[8]\n\nJerry Fodor and Ernest LePore (1992) raised an important challenge to\nChurchland\u2019s psychosemantics. Location in a state space alone\nseems insufficient to fix a state\u2019s representational content.\nChurchland never explains why a point in a three-dimensional state\nspace represents a color, as opposed to any other quality,\nobject, or event that varies along three\n dimensions.[9].\n So Churchland\u2019s account achieves its explanatory power by the\ninterpretation imposed on the dimensions. Fodor and LePore alleged\nthat Churchland never specified how a dimension comes to represent,\ne.g., degree of saltiness, as opposed to yellow-blue wavelength\nopposition. One obvious answer appeals to the stimuli that form the\n\u201cexternal\u201d inputs to the neural network in question. Then,\nfor example, the individuating conditions on neural representations of\ncolors are that opponent processing neurons receive input from a\nspecific class of photoreceptors. The latter in turn have\nelectromagnetic radiation (of a specific portion of the visible\nspectrum) as their activating stimuli. However, this appeal to\n\u201cexternal\u201d stimuli as the ultimate individuating\nconditions for representational content makes the resulting approach a\nversion of informational semantics. Is this approach consonant with\nother neurobiological details?\n\nThe neurobiological paradigm for informational semantics is the\nfeature detector: one or more neurons that are (i) maximally\nresponsive to a particular type of stimulus, and (ii) have the\nfunction of indicating the presence of that stimulus type. Examples of\nsuch stimulus-types for visual feature detectors include high-contrast\nedges, motion direction, and colors. A favorite feature detector among\nphilosophers is the alleged fly detector in the frog. Lettvin et al.\n(1959) identified cells in the frog retina that responded maximally to\nsmall shapes moving across the visual field. The idea that these\ncells\u2019 activity functioned to detect flies rested upon knowledge\nof the frogs\u2019 diet. (Bechtel 1998 provides a useful discussion.)\nUsing experimental techniques ranging from single-cell recording to\nsophisticated functional imaging, neuroscientists discovered a host of\nneurons that are maximally responsive to a variety of complex stimuli.\nHowever, establishing condition (ii) on a feature detector is much\nmore difficult. Even some paradigm examples have been called into\nquestion. David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel\u2019s (1962) Nobel\nPrize-winning work establishing the receptive fields of neurons in\nstriate (visual) cortex is often interpreted as revealing cells whose\nfunction is edge detection. However, Lehky and Sejnowski (1988)\nchallenged this interpretation. They trained an artificial neural\nnetwork to distinguish the three-dimensional shape and orientation of\nan object from its two-dimensional shading pattern. Their network\nincorporates many features of visual neurophysiology. Nodes in the\ntrained network turned out to be maximally responsive to edge\ncontrasts, but did not appear to have the function of edge detection.\n(See Churchland and Sejnowski 1992 for a review.)\n\nKathleen Akins (1996) offered a different neurophilosophical challenge\nto informational semantics and its affiliated feature-detection view\nof sensory representation. We saw in the previous section that Akins\nargued that the physiology of thermoreception violates three necessary\nconditions on \u201cveridical\u201d representation. From this fact\nshe raised doubts about looking for feature-detecting neurons to\nground a psychosemantics generally, including for thought contents.\nHuman thoughts about flies, for example, are sensitive to numerical\ndistinctions between particular flies and the particular locations\nthey can occupy. But the ends of frog nutrition are well served\nwithout a representational system sensitive to such ontological\nniceties. Whether a fly seen now is numerically identical to one seen\na moment ago need not, and perhaps cannot, figure into the\nfrog\u2019s feature detection repertoire. Akins\u2019 critique cast\ndoubt on whether details of sensory transduction will scale up to\nprovide an adequate unified psychosemantics for all concepts. It also\nraised new questions for human intentionality. How do we get from\nactivity patterns in \u201cnarcissistic\u201d sensory receptors,\nkeyed not to \u201cobjective\u201d environmental features but rather\nonly to effects of the stimuli on the patch of tissue innervated, to\nhuman ontologies replete with enduring objects with stable\nconfigurations of properties and relations, types and their tokens (as\nthe \u201cfly-thought\u201d example presented above reveals), and\nthe rest? And how did the development of a stable, rich ontology\nconfer survival advantages to human ancestors?\n",
