The mystical allusions to wine pertain to a type of intoxication which stands opposed to discursive thought. The esoteric use of wine and drinking, which has a long history in Persian Sufi literature, refers to the state of ecstasy in which one is intoxicated with Divine love. Those supporting the Sufi interpretation of Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t rely on this literary genre. While Khayyam was not a Sufi in the traditional sense of the word, he includes the mystical use of wine among his allusions.\nKhayyam\u2019s use of wine in the profound sense in his Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t is a type of Sophia that provides a sage with philosophical wisdom, allowing one to come to terms with the temporality of life and to live in the here and now:\n\nThose imprisoned by the intellect\u2019s need to decipher\nHumbled; knowing being from non-being, they proffer\nSeek ignorance and drink the juice of the grape\nThose fools acting as wise, scoffer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (translation by Aminrazavi)\n\nKhirad is the type of wisdom that brings about a rapprochement between the poetic and discursive modes of thought, one that sees the fundamental irony in what appears to be a senseless human existence within an orderly and complex physical universe. For Khayyam the mathematician-astronomer, the universe cannot be the result of a random chance; on the other hand, Khayyam the poet fails to find any purpose for an individual human existence in this orderly universe.\n\nAs Spring and Fall make their appointed turn,\nThe leaves of life one aft another turn;\nDrink wine and brood not\u2014as the Sage has said:\n\u201cLife\u2019s cares are poison, wine the cure in turn.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, Sa\u2018id\u012b 1994, 58)\n\n",
