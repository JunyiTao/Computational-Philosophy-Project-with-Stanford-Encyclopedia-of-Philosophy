    "main_text": "Applying the notion of nonconceptual content || Subpersonal computational states and nonconceptual content\n4.2 Subpersonal computational states and nonconceptual content\n\nThe dominant paradigm within cognitive science involves postulating\nrepresentational states at the subpersonal or subdoxastic levels (for\nphilosophical discussion see Stich 1978, Davies 1989). Examples are\nthe representational states implicated in tacit knowledge of the rules\nof syntax. It is a fundamental tenet of a broadly Chomskyan approach\nto syntax that speakers are credited with tacit knowledge of a grammar\nfor their language and that this tacit knowledge is deployed in\nunderstanding spoken language. Yet when linguists give theoretical\nspecifications of the syntactic rules contained within the grammar\nthey frequently employ concepts that are not in the conceptual\nrepertoire of the language-user. That is, the language-user is\nascribed knowledge of rules formulated in terms of concepts that he\ndoes not possess. A similar point holds for the representational\nstates postulated in computational theories of vision such as that put\nforward by Marr (1980). The contents of such states are formulated in\nterms of concepts (such as the concept of a zero-crossing) that are\nclearly not possessed by the average perceiver.\n\nWhy should it be thought that the language-user does not possess the\nrelevant concepts? How could he grasp the rule if he did not possess\nthe concepts required to spell it out? The point is not just that\nlanguage-users are not aware of the beliefs in question. Not all\nunconscious mental states are nonconceptual, e.g., my having the\nbelief that the earth revolves around the sun, often unconsciously,\nrequires that I possess the concepts of which its content is composed.\nThe point, rather, is that their representations of the linguistic\nrules are inferentially insulated from the rest of their beliefs and\npropositional attitudes, in a way that is fundamentally incompatible\nwith the holistic nature of conceptual contents. This is also the case\nfor representations at the early stages of visual processing. The\nrepresentations whose function is to register zero-crossings for\nsubsequent perceptual analysis, for example, operate independently of\nthe person\u2019s propositional attitudes, and so their content does\nnot depend on the person\u2019s conceptual repertoire.\n\nRecently such a view of the nature of representational content has\nbeen explored by Raftopoulos and M\u00fcller (2006). They suggest that\nwhat makes the content of a representation nonconceptual is precisely\nthe fact that its content is insulated from other knowledge structures\navailable to the person. Indeed, according to Raftopoulos and\nM\u00fcller, \u201cthe existence of cognitively impenetrable\nmechanisms is a necessary and sufficient condition for nonconceptual\ncontent\u201d (Raftopoulos and M\u00fcller 2006, p. 190). They review\nevidence to the effect that various early stages of visual processing,\ne.g., those responsible for attending to, and tracking, objects in\nspace and time, operate in purely bottom-up fashion. As such, they\nargue, the representations underlying such capacities are produced in\na conceptually unmediated way and hence their content is\nnonconceptual. Thus, they say, \u201c[t]he content of the states of\nzero-crossings is nonconceptual \u2026 because that content is\nretrieved bottom-up from a visual scene. To justify the nonconceptual\ncharacter of the contents of either phenomenal and subdoxastic stages\n[sic] \u2026 it suffices to invoke the fact that these\ncontents are retrieved from visual scenes in conceptually unmediated\nways\u201d (Raftopoulos and M\u00fcller 2006, p. 215).\n\nHowever, though Raftopoulos and M\u00fcller attempt to argue that\ninsulation from the propositional attitudes of the person is a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for any representation to\nhave nonconceptual content, this does not seem to be the case with\nrepresentations in general and certain personal level\nrepresentations in particular. At least with regards to\npersonal level representations, Tye (1995) argues that\none\u2019s conceptual capacities often are involved in determining\nthe content of a perceptual representation, and yet that the content\nof that representation is nonconceptual. This is the case, for\nexample, in the process of perceptually disambiguating an ambiguous\nfigure (e.g., the two faces/vase figure). Though the production of a\ndisambiguated perceptual representation (e.g., experiencing the figure\nas a vase) might involve more than merely information recovered\nbottom-up (e.g., it might employ the concept vase), it does\nnot follow that the resulting perception is conceptual. This is so\nsince for the content of a representation to be nonconceptual it\nmerely needs to be the case that one can undergo a state with\nsuch representational content without possessing the concepts that\nenter into a correct specification of its content, and it seems\nreasonable that one can undergo the same disambiguated experience of\nthe figure without possessing any concepts (and in particular, without\npossessing the concept vase).\n\nA similar suggestion concerning cognitive penetrability and its\npotential impact on the nonconceptual status of the penetrated states\nis explored by Macpherson (2012, 2015). One of her favorite examples\ncomes from Delk & Fillenbaum (1965), who demonstrate that\nfamiliarity with exemplars of a standardly colored category, e.g.,\nfamiliarity with (red) apples or (yellow) bananas, influences the\nperceived color of instances of that category. In a more recent study,\nHansen et al. (2006) obtained the same effect by presenting subjects\nwith a picture of a banana on a uniform grey background and asking\nthem to adjust the color of the fruit until it appears grey. Their\nresults show that \u201c\u2026subjects adjusted the banana to a slightly\nbluish hue--its opponent color--in order for it to appear neutral\ngray. At the point where the banana was actually achromatic, at the\norigin of the color space, it still appeared yellowish.\u201d(p. 1367) In\nthis case, it appears that one\u2019s knowledge of bananas\n\u2018penetrates\u2019 one\u2019s experience of bananas. She calls this form of\ncognitive penetration, cognitive penetration \u2018lite\u2019, where\npossession of some concepts may causally influence the type of\nexperience one undergoes. Yet she argues that in these cases, though\nthe token-experience of the banana\u2019s color is influenced by one\u2019s\nprior knowledge \u2013 one undergoes a deeper yellow type of experience \u2013\nit is an experience-type that one who does not have concepts\npertaining to such colors can nonetheless undergo.\n\nThus, it is consistent with the notion of nonconceptual content that\nthe representation in question is in fact produced in what Raftopoulos\nand M\u00fcller would call a conceptually mediated way,\nwhereby concepts in the subject\u2019s possession influence the\ncontent of a personal level representation, without the content of the\nrepresentation being specifiable in terms of concepts available to the\nsubject. That is, it does not seem to be a necessary\ncondition on the nonconceptual content of representations in general\nthat they be insulated from the propositional attitudes; at least in\nthe case of personal level representations this necessity\ncondition fails. Furthermore, Toribio (2014) argues that even in the\ncase of early vision, the specific target of Raftopoulos and M\u00fcller\n(2006), the claim that cognitive impenetrability is a necessary and\nsufficient condition on the contents of early vision being\nnonconceptual is false. (However, see Raftopoulos 2014a, 2014b, 2017\nfor possible replies.)\n\nStill, it is open to a critic of nonconceptual content to deny that\nascriptions of content at the subpersonal level should be taken\nliterally. John McDowell takes this view (McDowell 1994b), suggesting\nthat subpersonal content is merely \u201cas if\u201d content (an\nargument for the same conclusion is offered in Searle 1990).\nAlternatively, it might be argued (as in Connolly 2010) that the\nsubpersonal information processing actually involves concepts.\nHowever, these lines of argument fly in the face not just of the\npractice of cognitive scientists, but also of some important\nphilosophical analyses of the notion of subpersonal representation\n(Burge 1986, Egan 1992, Berm\u00fadez 1995).\n",
