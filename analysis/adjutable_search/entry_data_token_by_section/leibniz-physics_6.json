    "main_text": "Leibniz\u2019s Dynamics || A Brief Demonstration\n3.1 A Brief Demonstration\n\n\nIn his Principles of Philosophy, Descartes had argued that \nthe quantity of motion in the world remains constant, where the \nquantity of motion of a body is determined by its speed times its \nsize. So, for example, at Principles 2:36, Descartes argues \nthat \u201cif one part of matter moves twice as fast as another \nwhich is twice as large, we must consider that there is the same \nquantity of motion in each part; and if one part slows down, we must \nsuppose that some other part of equal size speeds up by the same \namount\u201d (AT VIIIA 61/CSM 240). This general conservation \nprinciple, which Descartes takes to be grounded in God\u2019s immutable \nnature, in turn serves as the foundation for his three laws of motion\nas well as his rules of impact. \n\n\nIn a short piece fully and tellingly entitled A Brief \nDemonstration of a Notable Error of Descartes and Others Concerning a\nNatural Law, According to which God is Said Always to Conserve the \nSame Quantity of Motion; a Law which They also Misuse in \nMechanics, Leibniz publicly attacked Descartes\u2019s conservation \nprinciple and thereby the foundations of Cartesian physics (GM \nVI.117\u2013119/L 296\u2013302). The central argument of the Brief \nDemonstration is ingenious and elegant, but only deceptively \nstraightforward, and Leibniz continued to develop and expand upon its\ncentral theme for many years after its initial public presentation in\n 1686.[15]\n\n\n\nAt the heart of Leibniz\u2019s main line of argument lie four premises: \n(1) The amount of force a body acquires in virtue of falling from a \ncertain altitude is equal to the amount of force that would be \nrequired to raise that same body to the same altitude. (2) The amount\nof force a one pound body acquires by falling from a height of four \nmeters is equal to the amount of force a four pound body acquires by \nfalling from a height of one meter. (3) Galileo\u2019s Law: the distance \ntraveled by a falling body is directly proportional to the square of \nthe time it falls (i.e. d = at2 where a \nis a constant); so, to illustrate, a falling body traveling a \ndistance of one meter in one second will travel four meters in two \nseconds, nine meters in three seconds, and sixteen meters in four \nseconds, \n etc.[16]\n (4) The total amount of force in the world is conserved both locally \nand globally with the result that there is always as much force in a \ncause as in its effect.\n\n\nUsing these four premises, Leibniz attempts to establish three \nprincipal conclusions. First, he argues that Descartes\u2019s quantity of \nmotion is not an adequate measure of force. To see this, suppose that\na four pound brick falls from a height of one meter in one second. \nIts quantity of motion = 1 m/s \u00d7 4lbs = 4 units. By Galileo\u2019s \nLaw it follows that a one pound brick dropped under similar \ncircumstances will travel four meters in two seconds (since the \ndistance traversed is proportional to the square of time). \nThe quantity of motion of a one pound brick falling through a \ndistance of four meters therefore = 2 m/s \u00d7 1lbs = 2 units. \nSince by the second premise the force of the two bodies is equal, but\ntheir quantities of motion are unequal, Leibniz concludes that \nquantity of motion is an inadequate measure of force. \n\n\nSecond, Leibniz is similarly able to argue that the quantity of \nvis viva (mv2) is an adequate \nmeasure of force. For, the quantity of vis viva of \nthe four pound brick falling from a height of one meter = \n(1m/s)2 \u00d7 4 lbs = 1 m/s \u00d7 4lbs = 4 units, and\nthe quantity of vis viva of the one pound brick \nfalling from a height of four meters = (2 m/s)2 \u00d7 1 \nlbs = 4 m/s \u00d7 1 lbs = 4 units. Thus if force is measured by \nthe quantity of vis viva rather than the quantity \nof motion the equality of the force acquired by the one pound body \nduring its four meter fall will be equal to the force acquired by the\nfour pound body during its one meter fall. \n\n\nThird, Leibniz is further able to argue that the quantity of vis \nviva rather than the quantity of motion is conserved. To see \nthis, suppose that a one pound brick, having been raised to a height \nof four meters, falls on the end of a teeter-totter imparting a \nmotion to a four pound brick on the other end. Now if the amount of \nactive force is conserved \u2013 if there is as much force in the \neffect as in the cause \u2013 then (by the first premise) the brick \nshould be raised to a height of one meter. That being the case, \nhowever, it is clear from the preceding demonstrations that the \nquantity of vis viva but not the quantity of motion will be \nconserved (since the quantity of motion has decreased from 4 units to\n2 units).[17]\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the fourth premise plays a crucial role \nnot only in Leibniz\u2019s proof, but also in the larger picture of what \nhe takes his proof to show. Early in his career, Leibniz took the \nprinciple of the equality of cause and effect to be a necessary \n truth.[18]\n Later, however, he came to hold that it is only hypothetically or \nmorally necessary \u2013 a contingent feature that must nonetheless \nbe found in the best of all possible worlds (see, for example, G IV \n281/L272). From the status of the principle of equality of cause and \neffect, Leibniz in turn drew two important conclusions, one \nmetaphysical, one methodological. With respect to metaphysics, he \ntook the contingent status of the principle of equality of cause and \neffect to be evidence that the laws of motion and force are \nthemselves contingent, and thus he argued that the elegance of the \nlaws of nature provides evidence of God\u2019s benevolent design of the \nuniverse. With respect to methodology, he took the derivation of the \nconservation of vis viva as confirmation of the utility \n\u2013 indeed the practical necessity \u2013 of considerations of \ndivine teleology in making scientific discoveries even in the domain \nof physics. \n",
