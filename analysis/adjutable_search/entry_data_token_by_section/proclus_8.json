    "main_text": "Philosophical views || Ethics (Providence, fate, freedom of choice, evil)\n3.4 Ethics (Providence, fate, freedom of choice, evil)\n\n\nProclus devoted three entire books or \u2018monographs\u2019\n(monobiblia) to problems of providence, fate, free choice, and\nevil. The first treatise (Ten problems concerning providence)\nexamines ten different problems on providence that were commonly\ndiscussed in the Platonic school. For Proclus providence\n(pronoia) is the beneficent activity of the first principle\n(the \u2018source of goods\u2019) and the gods (henads), who have\ntheir existence before intellect (pro-nou). One of\nthe problems discussed is the question of how divine foreknowledge and\nhuman free choice can be reconciled. For if god knows not only past and\npresent, but also future events, the outcome of future events is\nalready pre-determined (as god has a determinate knowledge of all\nthings), and hence there is no free choice for humans. Proclus\u2019\nanswer, which ultimately goes back to Iamblichus, consists in applying\nthe principle that the mode of knowledge is not conditioned by the\nobject known but by the knower. In the case of gods, this entails\nthat they know the contingent event in a non contingent manner, the\nmutable immutably. They have an undivided knowledge of things divided\nand a timeless knowledge of things temporal (Elem.\nTheol. \u00a7 124, cf. De decem dub. \u00a7 6\u20138).\nProclus\u2019 answer was later taken up by Ammonius in his\nCommentary on the De Interpretatione IX and in Boethius\u2019\nConsolation of Philosophy V 6 as well as in his Commentary\non the De Interpretatione IX.\n\n\nThe second treatise (On providence fate and what depends on\nus) replies to a letter of Theodore, a former friend of Proclus.\nIn this letter Theodore, an engineer, had defended with several\narguments a radical determinism, thus entirely excluding free choice.\nBefore refuting Theodore\u2019s arguments, Proclus introduces some\nfundamental distinctions in order to solve the problems raised by his\nold friend. The first distinction is between providence and fate:\n\n\nProvidence is essentially a god, whereas fate is something\ndivine, but not a god. This is because it depends upon providence and\nis as it were an image of it. (De prov. \u00a7 14) \n\n\nThe second distinction is that between two types of soul: the rational soul\nis separable from the body, the irrational resides in the body is\ninseparable from its substrate; \u201cthe latter depends in its being\nupon fate, the former upon providence\u201d (De prov. \u00a7\n15 ff.). The third distinction concerns knowledge and truth:\n\n\nOne type of knowledge exists in souls that are bound to the\nprocess of generation; [\u2026] another type is present in souls that\nhave escaped from this place. (De prov. \u00a7\n3.1\u20134.3) \n \n\nThese three distinctions taken together make it possible for\nProclus to ultimately reconcile providence, fate, and free choice. In so\nfar as we are rational agents and let ourselves being determined in our\nchoices only by intelligible principles, we may transcend the\ndeterminism of fate to which we belong as corporeal beings. Yet, our\nactions are integrated into the providential order, as we willingly\nobey the divine principles.\n\n\nThe third treatise (On the existence of evils) asks why and\nhow evil can exist if the world is governed by divine providence.\nProclus argues that evil does not have an existence of its own, but\nonly a derivative or parasitic existence (par-hypostasis, sc.\non the good) (De mal. \u00a7 50). \n\n\nIn order to exist in a proper sense, an effect must result from a cause which\nproceeds according to its nature towards a goal that is intended.\n[\u2026] Whenever an effect is produced that was not intended or is\nnot related by nature or per se to the agent, it is\nsaid to exist besides (para) the intended effect,\nparasitically upon it, as it were. (Opsomer-Steel 2003, 25) \n\n\nThis is precisely the case with evils, which are shortcomings and mistakes.\nAs a failure is never intended qua failure by an agent, but is\nan unfortunate by-effect of its action, so is evil qua evil\nnever caused by a cause. Therefore, Proclus continues, it is better to\ncall its mode of existence a parhupostasis, rather than a hupostasis, a\nterm that belongs to those beings \u201cthat proceed from causes\ntowards a goal.\u201d Parhupostasis or \u201cparasitic\nexistence,\u201d on the contrary, is the mode of existence of\n\u201cbeings that neither appear through causes in accordance with\nnature nor result in a definite end.\u201d \n\n\nEvils are not the outcome of goal-directed processes, but happen per accidens,\nas incidental by-products which fall outside the intention of the\nagents. [\u2026] Therefore it is appropriate to call such generation\na parasitic existence (parhupostasis), in that it is without\nend and unintended, uncaused in a way (anaition\np\u00f4s) and indefinite. (De mal.\n\u00a7 50.3\u20139, 29\u201331, transl. by Opsomer-Steel 2003) \n\n\nDionysius the Areopagite adopted Proclus\u2019 views on evil in his\nwork On the Divine Names. Thanks to this adaptation\nProclus\u2019 doctrine of evil had an enormous influence on the later\nmedieval discussions on evil both in Byzantium and in the Latin West\nand dominated the philosophical debates on evil up to the\n19th century.\n",
