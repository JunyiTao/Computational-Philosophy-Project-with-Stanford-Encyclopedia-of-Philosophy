    "main_text": "Historical Background and Locke\u2019s Life\n1. Historical Background and Locke\u2019s Life\n\nJohn Locke (1632\u20131704) was one of the greatest philosophers in\nEurope at the end of the seventeenth century. Locke grew up and lived\nthrough one of the most extraordinary centuries of English political\nand intellectual history. It was a century in which conflicts between\nCrown and Parliament and the overlapping conflicts between\nProtestants, Anglicans and Catholics swirled into civil war in the\n1640s. With the defeat and death of Charles I, there began a great\nexperiment in governmental institutions including the abolishment of\nthe monarchy, the House of Lords and the Anglican church, and the\nestablishment of Oliver Cromwell\u2019s Protectorate in the 1650s.\nThe collapse of the Protectorate after the death of Cromwell was\nfollowed by the Restoration of Charles II\u2014the return of the\nmonarchy, the House of Lords and the Anglican Church. This period\nlasted from 1660 to 1688. It was marked by continued conflicts between\nKing and Parliament and debates over religious toleration for\nProtestant dissenters and Catholics. This period ends with the\nGlorious Revolution of 1688 in which James II was driven from England\nand replaced by William of Orange and his wife Mary. The final period\nduring which Locke lived involved the consolidation of power by\nWilliam and Mary, and the beginning of William\u2019s efforts to\noppose the domination of Europe by the France of Louis XIV, which\nlater culminated in the military victories of John Churchill\u2014the\nDuke of Marlborough.\n",
