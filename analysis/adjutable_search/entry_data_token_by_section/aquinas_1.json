    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works\n1.2 Works\n\nOver a mere two decades of literary activity, Aquinas left behind more\nthan eight million words (eight times more than has survived, for\ninstance, from Aristotle). It is a measure of Aquinas\u2019s\nimmediate and lasting influence that\u2014quite unlike the situation\nwith other medieval philosophers\u2014essentially everything he wrote\nhas survived and has been lovingly edited and translated into English\nand many other modern languages. In outline, there are five categories\nof works:\n\nencyclopedic theological treatises, such as the Summa\ntheologiae and the Summa contra gentiles;\ndisputed questions, such as the Questions on Truth, often\nmore detailed than his summae;\nbrief works (opuscula), such as On Being and\nEssence;\ncommentaries on Aristotle and on other philosophical texts;\nbiblical commentaries.\n\n\nThe bibliography below contains further details about individual works\nand their chronology.\n\nThe Summa theologiae (ST) generally represents\nAquinas\u2019s most considered thought on a given topic, and the work\nis comprehensive enough that it contains at least some discussion of\nalmost all of Aquinas\u2019s intellectual concerns. It divides into\nfour parts:\n\nthe prima pars (1a): the nature of God and the created\nworld, including human nature;\nthe prima secundae (1a2ae): human action and what shapes\nit (passion, virtue, vice, law, grace);\nthe secunda secundae (2a2ae): the theological and\nphilosophical virtues, in detail;\nthe tertia pars (3a): Christ and the sacraments (complete\nthrough q. 90; his disciples drew on earlier texts to produce a\n\u201csupplement\u201d that brings the work to its intended\nend).\n\n\nThe treatments in ST are deliberately brief. Aquinas writes\nin the preface that \u201cour intent in this work is to develop those\nissues that concern the Christian religion in a way that suits the\neducation of those who are just beginning.\u201d Today, no one thinks\nof ST as a work for beginners, although its scope and\nconcision make it a useful place to start. A serious engagement with\nAquinas\u2019s work, however, requires comparing ST with\nparallel treatments elsewhere, such as the earlier Summa contra\ngentiles (SCG) and the still earlier commentary on\nLombard\u2019s Sentences. Moreover, since all three of these\nlong works are written as theological treatises, it is useful\nalso to compare these discussions with his accounts in the more\nphilosophically focused and often more detailed disputed questions. In\ngeneral, given how much Aquinas wrote and how often he reconsidered\nthe same issue from a slightly different perspective, a careful study\nof his work requires comparing multiple treatments of the same issue.\nAnd since he did not begin to circulate his work until he was 30, and\nlived for only two decades more, those various treatments tend to\nreinforce rather than conflict with each other. (Naturally, scholars\nhave long debated whether his thought evolves on one topic or another,\non which see Pini 2012.)\n\nMost of Aquinas\u2019s central texts are written in the distinctive\nscholastic style of the disputed question, in which the topic to be\ndiscussed is posed at the start as a question. The dispute begins with\na series of arguments on one side. These, however, almost always\nrepresent the opposite of Aquinas\u2019s own position, and so, after\nthe initial arguments, one or more arguments are posed to the contrary\n(sed contra), and then Aquinas makes his own main reply in\nthe body (corpus) of the article, and finally he responds to\nthe initial arguments (ad 1, ad 2, etc.). This structure is\nbased on actual classroom procedures, even if Aquinas\u2019s\ncarefully composed works are never a literal record of an actual\nclassroom debate. It is a method that lends itself to argumentative\nrigor, but often is best digested by reading the text in something\nother than the order in which it appears on the page. (I myself like\nto begin with the main reply.)\n\nAn important exception to the disputed-question format is\nAquinas\u2019s commentaries. These are often extremely useful for\nunderstanding his own philosophical thought. This is true most\nobviously of the philosophical commentaries, which cover most of\nAristotle\u2019s key works. The point holds true, however, for his\nbiblical commentaries as well, because they regularly contain\ninteresting discussions of wide-ranging philosophical topics (Stump\n2010). One has to approach all of Aquinas\u2019s commentaries with\nsome caution, however, because his principal method of commentary is\nto produce a word-by-word paraphrase. This means that, if one does not\nread these works with one eye on the text being commented upon, a\npassage that may seem to represent Aquinas\u2019s thought may instead\nbe a rephrased version of what Aristotle (or Isaiah or Paul) said.\nWhether or not Aquinas\u2019s paraphrase of a passage from Aristotle\nshould be treated as a reflection of Aquinas\u2019s own thought is a\nmatter of some dispute (Jenkins 1996; Elders 2009), but readers should\nat least be aware of how these commentaries are structured. The\npassages most likely to shed light on Aquinas\u2019s own thought are\nthose where he breaks away from his line-by-line paraphrase to offer a\nbrief lecture on some issue germane to a proper understanding of the\nunderlying text.\n\nIt is tempting, for modern readers, to divide Aquinas\u2019s work\ninto the theological and philosophical, but lines here are difficult\nto draw. The medieval university did formally distinguish between the\nhigher-level discipline of theology and the undergraduate arts\nfaculty, whose curriculum consisted largely in the works of Aristotle.\nBut many of the questions of the theologians\u2014such as the\nworkings of intellect, the nature of freedom, the systematization of\nethical theory\u2014are now seen as paradigmatically philosophical.\nAt the same time, much of Aristotle, and therefore much of the arts\nfaculty curriculum, looks to us more scientific than philosophical.\nAquinas, unlike his teacher Albert the Great, only occasionally\ndwelled on what we now think of as scientific questions. Conversely,\nas a professor of theology, he considered at great length various\nmatters that depend on\n divine revelation, such as the\nnature of the Trinity and the character of Christ\u2019s humanity. A\ncomplete understanding of Aquinas\u2019s thought thus requires\nspending considerable time with such properly theological\nquestions. At the same time, it is appropriate today to number Aquinas\namong the philosophers, because he was particularly interested in and\nhad particularly innovative things to say about what we now think of\nas philosophical questions. The tremendous energy he put into\ncommenting on Aristotle\u2019s works is a testimony both to the\nimportance he gives philosophy for a proper understanding of theology,\nand to his confidence that progress in philosophy will only benefit\nthe Christian faith. As he famously wrote, \u201cif anything is found\nin the words of the philosophers that is contrary to the faith, this\nis not philosophy but rather an abuse of philosophy, due to a failure\nof reason\u201d (Comm. Boethius De trinitate 2.3c).  \n\n\nFor book-length general surveys of Aquinas's thought see Stump 2003,\nDavies and Stump 2012, Shields and Pasnau 2016, Stump and White\n2022.\n",
