    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe government requires people to contribute to a pension system\n(Social Security). It requires motorcyclists to wear helmets. It\nforbids people from swimming at a public beach when lifeguards are not\npresent. It forbids the sale of various drugs deemed to be\nineffective. It forbids the sale of various drugs believed to be\nharmful. It does not allow consent to certain forms of assault to be a\ndefense against prosecution for that assault.\n\nThe civil law does not allow the enforcement of certain kinds of\ncontracts, e.g., for gambling debts. It requires minors to have blood\ntransfusions even if their religious beliefs forbid it. Persons may be\ncivilly committed if they are a danger to themselves.\n\nDoctors do not tell their patients the truth about their medical\ncondition. A physician may tell the wife of a man whose car went off a\nbridge into the water and drowned that he died instantly when in fact\nhe died a rather ghastly death.\n\nA husband may hide the sleeping pills from a depressed wife. A\nphilosophy department may require a student to take logic courses.\n\nA teacher may be less than honest about telling a student that he has\nlittle philosophical ability.\n\nAll of these rules, policies, and actions may be done for various\nreasons; may be justified by various considerations. When they are\njustified solely on the grounds that the person affected would be\nbetter off, or would be less harmed, as a result of the rule, policy,\netc., and the person in question would prefer not to be treated this\nway, we have an instance of paternalism.\n\nAs the examples indicate the question of paternalism is one that\narises in many different areas of our personal and public life. As\nsuch, it is an important realm of applied ethics. But it also raises\ncertain theoretical issues. Perhaps the most important is: what powers\nit is legitimate for a state, operating both coercively and in terms\nof incentives, to possess? It also raises questions about the proper\nways in which individuals, either in an institutional or purely\npersonal setting, should relate to one another. How should we think\nabout individual autonomy and its limits? What is it to respect the\npersonhood of others? What is the trade-off, if any, between regard\nfor the welfare of another and respect for their right to make their\nown decisions?\n\nThis entry examines some of the conceptual issues involved in\nanalyzing paternalism, and then discusses the normative issues\nconcerning the legitimacy of paternalism by the state and various\ncivil institutions.\n",
