    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nVery little is known about Crathorn\u2019s life. He might have been\nborn in the village of Crathorne in north Yorkshire. He became a\nDominican friar before going to Oxford, where he lectured on the first\nbook of Peter the Lombard\u2019s Sentences in the years\n1330\u201332, a work we can date because of a passage in which\nCrathorn mentions an eclipse that we know occurred on July 16, 1330.\nHis Dominican contemporary, Robert Holkot, also tells us that that he\nlectured at the same time (1331\u201333) as a Dominican named\nCrathorn (Courtenay 1978; Schepers 1970 and 1972)\n\nWilliam Crathorn also lectured on the Bible, and Holkot is presumably\nresponding to Crathorn\u2019s arguments in his Sex articuli.\nA manuscript in Vienna contains what could be Crathorn\u2019s\nforty-two quodlibetal questions (Richter 1972), but most of these\nquestions are similar to the ones contained in his Questions on\nthe Sentences (Quaestiones super librum\nsententiarum).\n",
