    "main_text": "Authenticity || Heidegger\u2019s Resolute Dasein\n5.4 Heidegger\u2019s Resolute Dasein\nHeidegger devotes much of the second half of Being and\nTime to an analysis of authenticity, employing the German term\nEigentlichkeit\u2014formed from the stem of the adjective\neigen (\u201cown\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d)\u2014that\nliterally means \u201cbeing own\u2019s own\u201d or\n\u201cownnness.\u201d But he sets up his analysis of authenticity by\nfirst claiming that self-deception or \u201cinauthenticity\u201d is\nunavoidable; it is a structure of the human condition, one that he\nrefers to as \u201cfalling\u201d (Verfallen). What this\nmeans is that in our everyday lives we invariably conform (or\n\u201cfall prey\u201d) to the norms and values of the public world.\nThis results in a kind of complacency and indifference about the\nquestion of existence, where we are not our own selves, where\n\u201ceveryone is the other, and no one is himself\u201d (1927\n[1962, 128]). Falling creates the illusion that our existence (or\nbeing-in-the-world) is secure and thing-like because we are doing what\neveryone else does. But, for Heidegger, there is nothing that\nfundamentally secures our existence. As a self-making activity, I am\nnot a stable thing. I am nothing, a \u201cnot yet\u201d (noch\nnicht) that is always unsettled, always in the process of\nmaking myself. The awareness of our own unsettledness emerges in\nmoments of anxiety when the familiar and routinized world\n\u201ccollapses into itself\u201d (1927 [1962, 186]), and I\n\u201cdie\u201d (sterben) because I am no longer\nable-to-be, that is, to understand or make sense of who I\n am.[8]\nLike Kierkegaard, Heidegger interprets anxiety as an\nindividualizing mood, one that momentarily \u201csnatches one\nback\u201d from the tranquilizing routines of \u201cthe They,\u201d\nleaving us vulnerable and exposed to confront our lives (1927 [1962,\n384]). And this is potentially liberating because it can temporarily\nfree us from patterns of self-deception, providing insight, a\n\u201cmoment of vision\u201d (Augenblick) that can give our\nlives a renewed sense of urgency and focus. But this experience of\nindividuation does not detach me from the world, turning me into a\nradical subject or \u201cfree floating \u2018I\u2019\u201d (1927\n[1962, 298]). Heidegger claims that our self-defining choices are\nalways guided in advance by our historical embeddedness, what he calls\n\u201chistoricity\u201d (Geschichtlichkeit). The meanings we\nchoose to give to our lives, then, are not created out of thin air;\nthey have already been interpreted and made intelligible by a\nhistorical community or \u201cpeople\u201d\n(Volk).[9]\nThe moment of vision\nshakes me out of my fallen, everyday existence and allows me to come\nback to my historical world with fresh eyes, to seize hold of the\npublicly interpreted meanings that matter to me and make them\n\u201cmine\u201d (Jemeinig). \nHeidegger refers to this authentic attitude in terms of\n\u201cresoluteness\u201d (Entschlossenheit), where I\n\u201cpull [myself] together,\u201d giving life a sense of cohesion\nand focus that was missing when I was lost and scattered in \u201cthe\nThey.\u201d But being resolute does not mean that I stubbornly cling\nto whatever possibilities I happen to choose. For Heidegger,\nauthenticity demands an openness and flexibility with how I\ninterpret\n myself.[10]\nUnderstanding that existence is a situated process of self-making,\nwhatever values or meanings I commit myself to, I must also be willing\nto let go or give up on them depending on the circumstances of my life,\nthat is, to \u201chold [myself] free for the possibility of taking\nit back\u201d (1927 [1962, 308]). Resoluteness, on this view,\ndoes not mean \u201cbecoming rigid\u201d and holding fast to a chosen\nidentity because my self-understanding is always insecure; it can die\nat any time. For this reason, authenticity requires\n\u201creadiness\u201d or \u201canticipation\u201d\n(Vorgriff), where we passionately hold ourselves open and free\nfor the inescapable breakdowns and emergencies of life. It is, in\nHeidegger\u2019s words, \u201can impassioned freedom towards\ndeath\u2014a freedom which has been released from the illusions of the\n\u2018They\u2019\u201d (1927 [1962, 266]). \n",
