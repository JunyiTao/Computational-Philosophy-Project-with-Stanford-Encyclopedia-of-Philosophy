    "main_text": "The Concept of a Nonexistent Object || The Logics of Nonexistent Objects\n1.1 The Logics of Nonexistent Objects\n\nIn those logics that stand in the Frege-Quine tradition, both\n\u201cthere is\u201d and \u201cexists\u201d are expressed by means\nof the \u201cexistential quantifier\u201d (\u201c\\(\\exists\\)\u201d),\nwhich is, consequently, interpreted as having \u201contological\nimport\u201d. Thus, in these formal systems, there is no means to\ndistinguish between \u201cthere is\u201d and \u201cexists\u201d.\nHowever, it has been shown that the distinction between the two can be\ncoherently regimented in various ways. In the systems of Terence\nParsons, Edward N. Zalta and Dale Jacquette, for instance,\n\u201cthere is an \\(x\\) such that \\(\\ldots x\\ldots\\)\u201d is expressed by\n\u201c\\(\\exists x(\\ldots x\\ldots)\\)\u201d, whereas\n\u201cthere exists an \\(x\\) such that \\(\\ldots x\\ldots\\)\u201d is expressed by\n\u201c\\(\\exists x\\rE !x \\amp \\ldots x\\ldots)\\)\u201d, where \u201cE!\u201d is the\nexistence predicate (Parsons 1980, Zalta 1983, Zalta 1988, Jacquette\n1996). \u201cSome things do not exist\u201d could thus be rendered\nin logical notation as follows:\n\u201c\\(\\exists x(\\neg\\rE !x)\\)\u201d; \u201cPegasus\ndoes not exist\u201d as \u201c\\(\\neg\\rE !p\\)\u201d; and so\nforth.\n\nGraham Priest (2005) has proposed a theory of nonexistent objects that\ntreats \u201cthere is\u201d and \u201cexists\u201d as synonyms. He\ninterprets quantification as utterly ontologically neutral. The\nquantifier should express neither \u201cthere is\u201d nor\n\u201cthere exists\u201d. Rather, quantifier expressions should be\nread \u201cFor some \\(x, \\ldots x\\ldots\\)\u201d,\nwhere \u201cFor some \\(x, \\ldots x\\ldots\\)\u201d\ndoes not imply that \u201cthere is (or exists) an \\(x\\) such\nthat \\(\\ldots x\\ldots\\)\u201d.\n\nThus, Priest belongs to those philosophers who distinguish between\n\u201cquantifier commitment\u201d and \u201contological\ncommitment\u201d (see Azzouni 2004), claiming that to\n\u201cquantifier over\u201d objects of a certain kind does not\nentail an ontological commitment to objects of this\n kind.[2]\n\nThe various logics of nonexistent objects cannot be described and\ndiscussed here in detail. However, it is now clear that there is no\nformal obstacle to a theory of nonexistent objects. The only\nquestions are philosophical: can the concepts that such theories aim\nto formalize be explained, and do we have good reason to accept a\ntheory formulated in these terms? In the following two sections, the\nmain motivations for believing in nonexistent objects are\ndelineated.\n",
