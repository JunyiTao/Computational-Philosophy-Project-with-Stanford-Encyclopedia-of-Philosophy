    "main_text": "Not-Being and Being || The Blending of Kinds\n5.5 The Blending of Kinds\n\n\nThe second part of the treatment of great kinds takes up question (2):\nWhat capacity do the five kinds have to associate with one another?\nThe Stranger carries out the analysis for one sample kind, change\n(Sophist 255e\u2013256d), and argues systematically that\nchange is non-identical with each of the other four kinds (change is\nnot rest, not the same, and so on), but partakes of three of the\nfour\u2014all but rest (for comprehensive analysis of the section,\nsee Brown 2008). Thus it turns out that change both is and\nis not each of the others (the Stranger even adds the\ncounterfactual: if change could partake of rest there would be nothing\nstrange about calling it resting [Sophist 256b]). The whole\nanalysis is implemented with two relations: non-identity (F-ness is\nnot G-ness, because F-ness partakes of difference from G-ness), and\npositive predication (F-ness is G, because F-ness partakes of\nG-ness). For example, change is not the same, because change partakes\nof difference from the same, but change is the same, because change\npartakes of sameness in relation to itself (Sophist\n256a\u2013b).\n\n\nScholars have noted that the Stranger\u2019s machinery, as so far \narticulated, seems insufficient to address the upcoming problem of \nfalse statement. The visitor has provided an analysis of identity \n(via being and sameness), non-identity (via being and difference), \nand positive predication (via being). What about negative \npredication, needed for Plato\u2019s analysis of false statements, \nsuch as \u201cTheaetetus is flying\u201d? Isn\u2019t this statement false, \nprecisely because the negative predication, \u201cTheaetetus is not \nflying,\u201d is true? Can Plato also handle negative predication?\n",
