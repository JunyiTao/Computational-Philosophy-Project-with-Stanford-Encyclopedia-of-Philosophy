    "main_text": "\n\nNeurath was a social scientist, scientific philosopher and maverick\nleader of the Vienna Circle who championed \u2018the scientific\nattitude\u2019 and the Unity of Science movement. He denied any value\nto philosophy over and above the pursuit of work on science, within\nscience and for science. And science was not logically fixed, securely\nfounded on experience nor was it the purveyor of any System of\nknowledge. Uncertainty, decision and cooperation were intrinsic to it.\nFrom this naturalistic, holistic and pragmatist viewpoint, philosophy\ninvestigates the conditions of the possibility of science as apparent\nin science itself, namely, in terms of physical, biological, social,\npsychological, linguistic, logical, mathematical, etc. conditions. His\nviews on the language, method and unity of science were led throughout\nby his interest in the social life of individuals and their\nwell-being. To theorize about society is inseparable from theorizing\nfor and within society. Science is in every sense a social and\nhistorical enterprise. It is as much about social objectives as it is\nabout physical objects, and about social realizations as much as about\nempirical reality. Objectivity and rationality, epistemic values to\nconstrain scientific thought, were radically social. The topics of\npolitical economy and visual education, based on the ISOTYPE language,\nare concrete legacies that have regained relevance, urgency and\ninterest. These are discussed in the supplements,\n Political Economy\n and\n Visual Education.\n",
