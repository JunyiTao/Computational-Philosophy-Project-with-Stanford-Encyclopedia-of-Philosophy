Classic Utilitarianism\n\nThe paradigm case of consequentialism is utilitarianism, whose classic\nproponents were Jeremy Bentham (1789), John Stuart Mill (1861), and\nHenry Sidgwick (1907). (For predecessors, see Schneewind 1997, 2002.)\nClassic utilitarians held hedonistic act consequentialism. Act\nconsequentialism is the claim that an act is morally right if and\nonly if that act maximizes the good, that is, if and only if the total\namount of good for all minus the total amount of bad for all is\ngreater than this net amount for any incompatible act available to the\nagent on that occasion. (Cf. Moore 1912, chs. 1\u20132.)\nHedonism then claims that pleasure is the only intrinsic good\nand that pain is the only intrinsic bad.\n\nThese claims are often summarized in the slogan that an act is right\nif and only if it causes \u201cthe greatest happiness for the\ngreatest number.\u201d This slogan is misleading, however. An act can\nincrease happiness for most (the greatest number of) people but still\nfail to maximize the net good in the world if the smaller number of\npeople whose happiness is not increased lose much more than the\ngreater number gains. The principle of utility would not allow that\nkind of sacrifice of the smaller number to the greater number unless\nthe net good overall is increased more than any alternative.\n\nClassic utilitarianism is consequentialist as opposed to deontological\nbecause of what it denies. It denies that moral rightness depends\ndirectly on anything other than consequences, such as whether the\nagent promised in the past to do the act now. Of course, the fact that\nthe agent promised to do the act might indirectly affect the\nact\u2019s consequences if breaking the promise will make other\npeople unhappy. Nonetheless, according to classic utilitarianism, what\nmakes it morally wrong to break the promise is its future effects on\nthose other people rather than the fact that the agent promised in the\npast (Sinnott-Armstrong 2009).\n\nSince classic utilitarianism reduces all morally relevant factors\n(Kagan 1998, 17\u201322) to consequences, it might appear simple.\nHowever, classic utilitarianism is actually a complex combination of\nmany distinct claims, including the following claims about the moral\nrightness of acts:\n\n\nConsequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends only on\nconsequences (as opposed to the circumstances or the\nintrinsic nature of the act or anything that happens before the\nact).\n\nActual Consequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends only\non the actual consequences (as opposed to foreseen,\nforeseeable, intended, or likely consequences).\n\nDirect Consequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends only\non the consequences of that act itself (as opposed to the\nconsequences of the agent\u2019s motive, of a rule or practice that\ncovers other acts of the same kind, and so on).\n\nEvaluative Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on the\nvalue of the consequences (as opposed to non-evaluative\nfeatures of the consequences).\n\nHedonism = the value of the consequences depends only on the\npleasures and pains in the consequences (as opposed\nto other supposed goods, such as freedom, knowledge, life, and so\non).\n\nMaximizing Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on which\nconsequences are best (as opposed to merely satisfactory or\nan improvement over the status quo).\n\nAggregative Consequentialism = which consequences are best is some\nfunction of the values of parts of those consequences (as\nopposed to rankings of whole worlds or sets of consequences).\n\nTotal Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on the\ntotal net good in the consequences (as opposed to the average\nnet good per person).\n\nUniversal Consequentialism = moral rightness depends on the\nconsequences for all people or sentient beings (as opposed to\nonly the individual agent, members of the individual\u2019s society,\npresent people, or any other limited group).\n\nEqual Consideration = in determining moral rightness, benefits to one\nperson matter just as much as similar benefits to any other\nperson (as opposed to putting more weight on the worse or worst\noff).\n\nAgent-neutrality = whether some consequences are better than others\ndoes not depend on whether the consequences are evaluated from the\nperspective of the agent (as opposed to an observer).\n\n\nThese claims could be clarified, supplemented, and subdivided further.\nWhat matters here is just that most pairs of these claims are\nlogically independent, so a moral theorist could consistently accept\nsome of them without accepting others. Yet classic utilitarians\naccepted them all. That fact makes classic utilitarianism a more\ncomplex theory than it might appear at first sight.\n\nIt also makes classic utilitarianism subject to attack from many\nangles. Persistent opponents posed plenty of problems for classic\nutilitarianism. Each objection led some utilitarians to give up some\nof the original claims of classic utilitarianism. By dropping one or\nmore of those claims, descendants of utilitarianism can construct a\nwide variety of moral theories. Advocates of these theories often call\nthem consequentialism rather than utilitarianism so that their\ntheories will not be subject to refutation by association with the\nclassic utilitarian theory.\n2. What is Consequentialism?\n\nThis array of alternatives raises the question of which moral theories\ncount as consequentialist (as opposed to deontological) and why. In\nactual usage, the term \u201cconsequentialism\u201d seems to be used\nas a family resemblance term to refer to any descendant of classic\nutilitarianism that remains close enough to its ancestor in the\nimportant respects. Of course, different philosophers see different\nrespects as the important ones (Portmore 2020). Hence, there is no\nagreement on which theories count as consequentialist under this\ndefinition.\n\nTo resolve this vagueness, we need to determine which of the various\nclaims of classic utilitarianism are essential to consequentialism.\nOne claim seems clearly necessary. Any consequentialist theory must\naccept the claim that I labeled \u201cconsequentialism\u201d,\nnamely, that certain normative properties depend only on consequences.\nIf that claim is dropped, the theory ceases to be\nconsequentialist.\n\nIt is less clear whether that claim by itself is sufficient to make a\ntheory consequentialist. Several philosophers assert that a moral\ntheory should not be classified as consequentialist unless it is\nagent-neutral (McNaughton and Rawling 1991, Howard-Snyder 1994, Pettit\n1997). This narrower definition is motivated by the fact that many\nself-styled critics of consequentialism argue against\nagent-neutrality.\n\nOther philosophers prefer a broader definition that does not require a\nmoral theory to be agent-neutral in order to be consequentialist\n(Bennett 1989; Broome 1991, 5\u20136; and Skorupski 1995). Criticisms\nof agent-neutrality can then be understood as directed against one\npart of classic utilitarianism that need not be adopted by every moral\ntheory that is consequentialist. Moreover, according to those who\nprefer a broader definition of consequentialism, the narrower\ndefinition conflates independent claims and obscures a crucial\ncommonality between agent-neutral consequentialism and other moral\ntheories that focus exclusively on consequences, such as moral egoism\nand recent self-styled consequentialists who allow agent-relativity\ninto their theories of value (Sen 1982, Broome 1991, Portmore 2001,\n2003, 2011).\n\nA definition solely in terms of consequences might seem too broad,\nbecause it includes absurd theories such as the theory that an act is\nmorally right if it increases the number of goats in Texas. Of course,\nsuch theories are implausible. Still, it is not implausible to call\nthem consequentialist, since they do look only at consequences. The\nimplausibility of one version of consequentialism does not make\nconsequentialism implausible in general, since other versions of\nconsequentialism still might be plausible.\n\nBesides, anyone who wants to pick out a smaller set of moral theories\nthat excludes this absurd theory may talk about evaluative\nconsequentialism, which is the claim that moral rightness depends only\non the value of the consequences. Then those who want to talk about\nthe even smaller group of moral theories that accepts both evaluative\nconsequentialism and agent-neutrality may describe them as\nagent-neutral evaluative consequentialism. If anyone still insists on\ncalling these smaller groups of theories by the simple name,\n\u2018consequentialism\u2019, this narrower word usage will not\naffect any substantive issue.\n\nStill, if the definition of consequentialism becomes too broad, it\nmight seem to lose force. Some philosophers have argued that any moral\ntheory, or at least any plausible moral theory, could be represented\nas a version of consequentialism (Sosa 1993, Portmore 2009, Dreier\n1993 and 2011; but see Brown 2011). If so, then it means little to\nlabel a theory as consequentialist. The real content comes only by\ncontrasting theories that are not consequentialist.\n\nIn the end, what matters is only that we get clear about which\ntheories a particular commentator counts as consequentialist or not\nand which claims are supposed to make them consequentialist or not.\nOnly then can we know which claims are at stake when this commentator\nsupports or criticizes what they call \u201cconsequentialism\u201d.\nThen we can ask whether each objection really refutes that particular\nclaim.\n3. What is Good? Hedonistic vs. Pluralistic Consequentialisms\n\nSome moral theorists seek a single simple basic principle because they\nassume that simplicity is needed in order to decide what is right when\nless basic principles or reasons conflict. This assumption seems to\nmake hedonism attractive. Unfortunately, however, hedonism is not as\nsimple as they assume, because hedonists count both pleasures and\npains. Pleasure is distinct from the absence of pain, and pain is\ndistinct from the absence of pleasure, since sometimes people feel\nneither pleasure nor pain, and sometimes they feel both at once.\nNonetheless, hedonism was adopted partly because it seemed simpler\nthan competing views.\n\nThe simplicity of hedonism was also a source of opposition. From the\nstart, the hedonism in classic utilitarianism was treated with\ncontempt. Some contemporaries of Bentham and Mill argued that hedonism\nlowers the value of human life to the level of animals, because it\nimplies that, as Bentham said, an unsophisticated game (such as\npush-pin) is as good as highly intellectual poetry if the game creates\nas much pleasure (Bentham 1843). Quantitative hedonists\nsometimes respond that great poetry almost always creates more\npleasure than trivial games (or sex and drugs and rock-and-roll),\nbecause the pleasures of poetry are more certain (or probable),\ndurable (or lasting), fecund (likely to lead to other pleasures), pure\n(unlikely to lead to pains), and so on.\n\nMill used a different strategy to avoid calling push-pin as good as\npoetry. He distinguished higher and lower qualities of pleasures\naccording to the preferences of people who have experienced both kinds\n(Mill 1861, 56; compare Plato 1993 and Hutcheson 1755, 421\u201323).\nThis qualitative hedonism has been subjected to much\ncriticism, including charges that it is incoherent and does not count\nas hedonism (Moore 1903, 80\u201381; cf. Feldman 1997,\n106\u201324).\n\nEven if qualitative hedonism is coherent and is a kind of hedonism, it\nstill might not seem plausible. Some critics argue that not\nall pleasures are valuable, since, for example, there is no\nvalue in the pleasures that a sadist gets from whipping a victim or\nthat an addict gets from drugs. Other opponents object that not\nonly pleasures are intrinsically valuable, because other\nthings are valuable independently of whether they lead to pleasure or\navoid pain. For example, my love for my wife does not seem to become\nless valuable when I get less pleasure from her because she contracts\nsome horrible disease. Similarly, freedom seems valuable even when it\ncreates anxiety, and even when it is freedom to do something (such as\nleave one\u2019s country) that one does not want to do. Again, many\npeople value knowledge of distant galaxies regardless of whether this\nknowledge will create pleasure or avoid pain.\n\nThese points against hedonism are often supplemented with the story of\nthe experience machine found in Nozick 1974 (42\u201345; cf. De\nBrigard 2010) and the movie, The Matrix. People on this\nmachine believe they are spending time with their friends,\nwinning Olympic gold medals and Nobel prizes, having sex with their\nfavorite lovers, or doing whatever gives them the greatest balance of\npleasure over pain. Although they have no real friends or lovers and\nactually accomplish nothing, people on the experience machine get just\nas much pleasure as if their beliefs were true. Moreover, they feel no\n(or little) pain. Assuming that the machine is reliable, it would seem\nirrational not to hook oneself up to this machine if pleasure\nand pain were all that mattered, as hedonists claim. Since it does\nnot seem irrational to refuse to hook oneself up to this\nmachine, hedonism seems inadequate. The reason is that hedonism\noverlooks the value of real friendship, knowledge, freedom,\nand achievements, all of which are lacking for deluded people on the\nexperience machine.\n\nSome hedonists claim that this objection rests on a misinterpretation\nof hedonism. If hedonists see pleasure and pain as\nsensations, then a machine might be able to reproduce those\nsensations. However, we can also say that a mother is pleased that her\ndaughter gets good grades. Such propositional pleasure occurs\nonly when the state of affairs in which the person takes pleasure\nexists (that is, when the daughter actually gets good grades). But the\nrelevant states of affairs would not really exist if one were hooked\nup to the experience machine. Hence, hedonists who value propositional\npleasure rather than or in addition to sensational pleasure can deny\nthat more pleasure is achieved by hooking oneself up to such an\nexperience machine (Feldman 1997, 79\u2013105; see also\nT\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 1998 and Feldman 2004 for more on hedonism).\n\nA related position rests on the claim that what is good is desire\nsatisfaction or the fulfillment of preferences; and what is bad is the\nfrustration of desires or preferences. What is desired or preferred is\nusually not a sensation but is, rather, a state of affairs, such as\nhaving a friend or accomplishing a goal. If a person desires or\nprefers to have true friends and true accomplishments and not to be\ndeluded, then hooking this person up to the experience machine need\nnot maximize desire satisfaction. Utilitarians who adopt this theory\nof value can then claim that an agent morally ought to do an act if\nand only if that act maximizes desire satisfaction or preference\nfulfillment (that is, the degree to which the act achieves whatever is\ndesired or preferred). What maximizes desire satisfaction or\npreference fulfillment need not maximize sensations of pleasure when\nwhat is desired or preferred is not a sensation of pleasure. This\nposition is usually described as preference\nutilitarianism.\n\nOne problem for preference utilitarianism concerns how to make\ninterpersonal comparisons (though this problem also arises for several\nother theories of value). If we want to know what one person prefers,\nwe can ask what that person would choose in conflicts. We cannot,\nhowever, use the same method to determine whether one person\u2019s\npreference is stronger or weaker than another person\u2019s\npreference, since these different people might choose differently in\nthe decisive conflicts. We need to settle which preference (or\npleasure) is stronger because we may know that Jones prefers A\u2019s\nbeing done to A\u2019s not being done (and Jones would receive more\npleasure from A\u2019s being done than from A\u2019s not being\ndone), whereas Smith prefers A\u2019s not being done (and Smith would\nreceive more pleasure from A\u2019s not being done than from\nA\u2019s being done). To determine whether it is right to do A or not\nto do A, we must be able to compare the strengths of Jones\u2019s and\nSmith\u2019s preferences (or the amounts of pleasure each would\nreceive in her preferred outcome) in order to determine whether doing\nA or not doing A would be better overall. Utilitarians and\nconsequentialists have proposed many ways to solve this problem of\ninterpersonal comparison, and each attempt has received criticisms.\nDebates about this problem still rage. (For a recent discussion with\nreferences, see Coakley 2015.)\n\nPreference utilitarianism is also often criticized on the grounds that\nsome preferences are misinformed, crazy, horrendous, or trivial. I\nmight prefer to drink the liquid in a glass because I think that it is\nbeer, though it really is strong acid. Or I might prefer to die merely\nbecause I am clinically depressed. Or I might prefer to torture\nchildren. Or I might prefer to spend my life learning to write as\nsmall as possible. In all such cases, opponents of preference\nutilitarianism can deny that what I prefer is really good. Preference\nutilitarians can respond by limiting the preferences that make\nsomething good, such as by referring to informed desires that do not\ndisappear after therapy (Brandt 1979). However, it is not clear that\nsuch qualifications can solve all of the problems for a preference\ntheory of value without making the theory circular by depending on\nsubstantive assumptions about which preferences are for good\nthings.\n\nMany consequentialists deny that all values can be reduced to any\nsingle ground, such as pleasure or desire satisfaction, so they\ninstead adopt a pluralistic theory of value. Moore\u2019s ideal\nutilitarianism, for example, takes into account the values of\nbeauty and truth (or knowledge) in addition to pleasure (Moore 1903,\n83\u201385, 194; 1912). Other consequentialists add the intrinsic\nvalues of friendship or love, freedom or ability, justice or fairness,\ndesert, life, virtue, and so on.\n\nIf the recognized values all concern individual welfare, then the\ntheory of value can be called welfarist (Sen 1979). When a\nwelfarist theory of value is combined with the other elements of\nclassic utilitarianism, the resulting theory can be called\nwelfarist consequentialism.\n\nOne non-welfarist theory of value is perfectionism, which\nclaims that certain states make a person\u2019s life good without\nnecessarily being good for the person in any way that increases that\nperson\u2019s welfare (Hurka 1993, esp. 17). If this theory of value\nis combined with other elements of classic utilitarianism, the\nresulting theory can be called perfectionist consequentialism\nor, in deference to its Aristotelian roots, eudaemonistic\nconsequentialism.\n\nSimilarly, some consequentialists hold that an act is right if and\nonly if it maximizes some function of both happiness and capabilities\n(Sen 1985, Nussbaum 2000). Disabilities are then seen as bad\nregardless of whether they are accompanied by pain or loss of\npleasure.\n\nOr one could hold that an act is right if it maximizes fulfillment (or\nminimizes violation) of certain specified moral rights. Such theories\nare sometimes described as a utilitarianism of rights. This\napproach could be built into total consequentialism with rights\nweighed against happiness and other values or, alternatively, the\ndisvalue of rights violations could be lexically ranked prior to any\nother kind of loss or harm (cf. Rawls 1971, 42). Such a lexical\nranking within a consequentialist moral theory would yield the result\nthat nobody is ever justified in violating rights for the sake of\nhappiness or any value other than rights, although it would still\nallow some rights violations in order to avoid or prevent other rights\nviolations.\n\nWhen consequentialists incorporate a variety of values, they need to\nrank or weigh each value against the others. This is often difficult.\nSome consequentialists even hold that certain values are\nincommensurable or incomparable in that no comparison of their values\nis possible (Griffin 1986 and Chang 1997). This position allows\nconsequentialists to recognize the possibility of irresolvable moral\ndilemmas (Sinnott-Armstrong 1988, 81; Railton 2003, 249\u201391).\n\nPluralism about values also enables consequentialists to handle many\nof the problems that plague hedonistic utilitarianism. For example,\nopponents often charge that classical utilitarians cannot explain our\nobligations to keep promises and not to lie when no pain is caused or\npleasure is lost. Whether or not hedonists can meet this challenge,\npluralists can hold that knowledge is intrinsically good and/or that\nfalse belief is intrinsically bad. Then, if deception causes false\nbeliefs, deception is instrumentally bad, and agents ought not to lie\nwithout a good reason, even when lying causes no pain or loss of\npleasure. Since lying is an attempt to deceive, to lie is to attempt\nto do what is morally wrong (in the absence of defeating factors).\nSimilarly, if a promise to do an act is an attempt to make an audience\nbelieve that the promiser will do the act, then to break a promise is\nfor a promiser to make false a belief that the promiser created or\ntried to create. Although there is more tale to tell, the disvalue of\nfalse belief can be part of a consequentialist story about why it is\nmorally wrong to break promises.\n\nWhen such pluralist versions of consequentialism are not welfarist,\nsome philosophers would not call them utilitarian. However,\nthis usage is not uniform, since even non-welfarist views are\nsometimes called utilitarian. Whatever you call them, the important\npoint is that consequentialism and the other elements of classical\nutilitarianism are compatible with many different theories about which\nthings are good or valuable.\n\nInstead of turning pluralist, some consequentialists foreswear the\naggregation of values. Classic utilitarianism added up the values\nwithin each part of the consequences to determine which total set of\nconsequences has the most value in it. One could, instead, aggregate\ngoods for each individual but not aggregate goods of separate\nindividuals (Roberts 2002). Alternatively, one could give up all\naggregation, including aggregation for individuals, and instead rank\nthe complete worlds or sets\u00a0of consequences\u00a0caused\u00a0by\nacts without adding up the values of the parts of those worlds or\nconsequences. One motive for this move is Moore\u2019s principle of\norganic unity (Moore 1903, 27\u201336), which claims that the value\nof a combination or \u201corganic unity\u201d of two or more things\ncannot be calculated simply by adding the values of the things that\nare combined or unified. For example, even if punishment of a criminal\ncauses pain, a consequentialist can hold that a world with both the\ncrime and the punishment is better than a world with the crime but not\nthe punishment, perhaps because the former contains more justice,\nwithout adding the value of this justice to\u00a0the negative value of\nthe pain of\u00a0the punishment. Similarly, a world might seem better\nwhen people do not get pleasures that they do not deserve, even if\nthis judgment is not reached by adding the values of these pleasures\nto other values to calculate any total. Cases like these lead some\nconsequentialists to deny that moral rightness is any aggregative\nfunction of the values of particular effects of acts. Instead, they\ncompare the whole world\u00a0that results from an action with the\nwhole world that results from not doing that action. If the former is\nbetter, then the action is morally right (J.J.C. Smart 1973, 32;\nFeldman 1997, 17\u201335). This approach can be called holistic\nconsequentialism or world utilitarianism.\n\nAnother way to incorporate relations among values is to consider\ndistribution. Compare one outcome where most people are\ndestitute but a few lucky people have extremely large amounts of goods\nwith another outcome that contains slightly less total goods but where\nevery person has nearly the same amount of goods. Egalitarian critics\nof classical utilitarianism argue that the latter outcome is better,\nso more than the total amount of good matters. Traditional hedonistic\nutilitarians who prefer the latter outcome often try to justify\negalitarian distributions of goods by appealing to a principle of\ndiminishing marginal utility. Other consequentialists, however,\nincorporate a more robust commitment to equality. Early on, Sidgwick\n(1907, 417) responded to such objections by allowing distribution to\nbreak ties between other values. More recently, some consequentialists\nhave added some notion of fairness (Broome 1991, 192\u2013200) or\ndesert (Feldman 1997, 154\u201374) to their test of which outcome is\nbest. (See also Kagan 1998, 48\u201359.) Others turn to\nprioritarianism, which puts more weight on people who are worse off\n(Adler and Norheim 2022, Arneson 2022). Such consequentialists do not\nsimply add up values; they look at patterns.\n\nA related issue arises from population change. Imagine that a\ngovernment considers whether to provide free contraceptives to curb a\nrise in population. Without free contraceptives, overcrowding will\nbring hunger, disease, and pain, so each person will be worse off.\nStill, each new person will have enough pleasure and other goods that\nthe total net utility will increase with the population. Classic\nutilitarianism focuses on total utility, so it seems to imply that\nthis government should not provide free contraceptives. That seems\nimplausible to many utilitarians. To avoid this result, some\nutilitarians claim that an act is morally wrong if and only if its\nconsequences contain more pain (or other disvalues) than an\nalternative, regardless of positive values (cf. R. N. Smart 1958).\nThis negative utilitarianism implies that the government\nshould provide contraceptives, since that program reduces pain (and\nother disvalues), even though it also decreases total net pleasure (or\ngood). Unfortunately, negative utilitarianism also seems to imply that\nthe government should painlessly kill everyone it can, since dead\npeople feel no pain (and have no false beliefs, diseases, or\ndisabilities \u2013 though killing them does cause loss of ability).\nA more popular response is average utilitarianism, which says that the\nbest consequences are those with the highest average utility (cf.\nRawls 1971, 161\u201375). The average utility would be higher with\nthe contraceptive program than without it, so average utilitarianism\nyields the more plausible result\u2014that the government should\nadopt the contraceptive program. Critics sometimes charge that the\naverage utility could also be increased by killing the worst off, but\nthis claim is not at all clear, because such killing would put\neveryone in danger (since, after the worst off are killed, another\ngroup becomes the worst off, and then they might be killed next).\nStill, average utilitarianism faces problems of its own (such as\n\u201cthe mere addition paradox\u201d in Parfit 1984, chap. 19). In\nany case, all maximizing consequentialists, whether or not they are\npluralists, must decide whether moral rightness depends on maximizing\ntotal good or average good.\n\nA final challenge to consequentialists\u2019 accounts of value\nderives from Geach 1956 and has been pressed by Thomson 2001. Thomson\nargues that \u201cA is a good X\u201d (such as a good poison) does\nnot entail \u201cA is good\u201d, so the term \u201cgood\u201d is\nan attributive adjective and cannot legitimately be used without\nqualification. On this view, it is senseless to call something good\nunless this means that it is good for someone or in some respect or\nfor some use or at some activity or as an instance of some kind.\nConsequentialists are supposed to violate this restriction when they\nsay that the total or average consequences or the world as a whole is\ngood without any such qualification. However, consequentialists can\nrespond either that the term \u201cgood\u201d has predicative uses\nin addition to its attributive uses or that when they call a world or\ntotal set of consequences good, they are calling it good for\nconsequences or for a world (Sinnott-Armstrong 2003a). If so, the fact\nthat \u201cgood\u201d is often used attributively creates no problem\nfor consequentialists.\n4. Which Consequences? Actual vs. Expected Consequentialisms\n\nA second set of problems for classic utilitarianism is\nepistemological. Classic utilitarianism seems to require that agents\ncalculate all consequences of each act for every person for all time.\nThat\u2019s impossible.\n\nThis objection rests on a misinterpretation. These critics assume that\nthe principle of utility is supposed to be used as a decision\nprocedure or guide, that is, as a method that agents\nconsciously apply to acts in advance to help them make decisions.\nHowever, most classic and contemporary utilitarians and\nconsequentialists do not propose their principles as decision\nprocedures. (Bales 1971) Bentham wrote, \u201cIt is not to be\nexpected that this process [his hedonic calculus] should be strictly\npursued previously to every moral judgment.\u201d (1789, Chap. IV,\nSec. VI) Mill agreed, \u201cit is a misapprehension of the\nutilitarian mode of thought to conceive it as implying that people\nshould fix their minds upon so wide a generality as the world, or\nsociety at large.\u201d (1861, Chap. II, Par. 19) Sidgwick added,\n\u201cIt is not necessary that the end which gives the criterion of\nrightness should always be the end at which we consciously aim.\u201d\n(1907, 413)\n\nInstead, most consequentialists claim that overall utility is the\ncriterion or standard of what is morally right or\nmorally ought to be done. Their theories are intended to spell out the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for an act to be morally right,\nregardless of whether the agent can tell in advance whether those\nconditions are met. Just as the laws of physics govern golf ball\nflight, but golfers need not calculate physical forces while planning\nshots; so overall utility can determine which decisions are morally\nright, even if agents need not calculate utilities while making\ndecisions. If the principle of utility is used as a criterion of the\nright rather than as a decision procedure, then classical\nutilitarianism does not require that anyone know the total\nconsequences of anything before making a decision.\n\nFurthermore, a utilitarian criterion of right implies that it would\nnot be morally right to use the principle of utility as a decision\nprocedure in cases where it would not maximize utility to try to\ncalculate utilities before acting. Utilitarians regularly argue that\nmost people in most circumstances ought not to try to calculate\nutilities, because they are too likely to make serious miscalculations\nthat will lead them to perform actions that reduce utility. It is even\npossible to hold that most agents usually ought to follow their moral\nintuitions, because these intuitions evolved to lead us to perform\nacts that maximize utility, at least in likely circumstances (Hare\n1981, 46\u201347). Some utilitarians (Sidgwick 1907, 489\u201390)\nsuggest that a utilitarian decision procedure may be adopted as an\nesoteric morality by an elite group that is better at calculating\nutilities, but utilitarians can, instead, hold that nobody should use\nthe principle of utility as a decision procedure.\n\nThis move is supposed to make consequentialism self-refuting,\naccording to some opponents. However, there is nothing incoherent\nabout proposing a decision procedure that is separate from one\u2019s\ncriterion of the right. Similar distinctions apply in other normative\nrealms. The criterion of a good stock investment is its total return,\nbut the best decision procedure still might be to reduce risk by\nbuying an index fund or blue-chip stocks. Criteria can, thus, be\nself-effacing without being self-refuting (Parfit 1984, chs. 1 and\n4).\n\nOthers object that this move takes the force out of consequentialism,\nbecause it leads agents to ignore consequentialism when they make real\ndecisions. However, a criterion of the right can be useful at a higher\nlevel by helping us choose among available decision procedures and\nrefine our decision procedures as circumstances change and we gain\nmore experience and knowledge. Hence, most consequentialists do not\nmind giving up consequentialism as a direct decision procedure as long\nas consequences remain the criterion of rightness (but see Chappell\n2001).\n\nIf overall utility is the criterion of moral rightness, then it might\nseem that nobody could know what is morally right. If so, classical\nutilitarianism leads to moral skepticism. However, utilitarians insist\nthat we can have strong reasons to believe that certain acts reduce\nutility, even if we have not yet inspected or predicted every\nconsequence of those acts. For example, in normal circumstances, if\nsomeone were to torture and kill his children, it is possible that\nthis would maximize utility, but that is very unlikely. Maybe they\nwould have grown up to be mass murders, but it is at least as likely\nthat they would grow up to cure serious diseases or do other great\nthings, and it is much more likely that they would have led normally\nhappy (or at least not destructive) lives. So observers as well as\nagents have adequate reasons to believe that such acts are morally\nwrong, according to act utilitarianism. In many other cases, it will\nstill be hard to tell whether an act will maximize utility, but that\nshows only that there are severe limits to our knowledge of what is\nmorally right. That should be neither surprising nor problematic for\nutilitarians.\n\nIf utilitarians want their theory to allow more moral knowledge, they\ncan make a different kind of move by turning from actual consequences\nto expected or expectable consequences. Suppose that Alice finds a\nrunaway teenager who asks for money to get home. Alice wants to help\nand reasonably believes that buying a bus ticket home for this runaway\nwill help, so she buys a bus ticket and puts the runaway on the bus.\nUnfortunately, the bus is involved in a freak accident, and the\nrunaway is killed. If actual consequences are what determine moral\nwrongness, then it was morally wrong for Alice to buy the bus ticket\nfor this runaway. Opponents claim that this result is absurd enough to\nrefute classic utilitarianism.\n\nSome utilitarians bite the bullet and say that Alice\u2019s act was\nmorally wrong, but it was blameless wrongdoing, because her motives\nwere good, and she was not responsible, given that she could not have\nforeseen that her act would cause harm. Since this theory makes actual\nconsequences determine moral rightness, it can be called actual\nconsequentialism.\n\nOther responses claim that moral rightness depends on foreseen,\nforeseeable, intended, or likely consequences, rather than actual\nones. Imagine that Bob does not in fact foresee a bad consequence that\nwould make his act wrong if he did foresee it, but that Bob could\neasily have foreseen this bad consequence if he had been paying\nattention. Maybe he does not notice the rot on the hamburger he feeds\nto his kids which makes them sick. If foreseen consequences\nare what matter, then Bob\u2019s act is not morally wrong. If\nforeseeable consequences are what matter, then Bob\u2019s\nact is morally wrong, because the bad consequences were foreseeable.\nNow consider Bob\u2019s wife, Carol, who notices that the meat is\nrotten but does not want to have to buy more, so she feeds it to her\nchildren anyway, hoping that it will not make them sick; but it does.\nCarol\u2019s act is morally wrong if foreseen or foreseeable\nconsequences are what matter, but not if what matter are\nintended consequences, because she does not intend to make\nher children sick. Finally, consider Bob and Carol\u2019s son Don,\nwho does not know enough about food to be able to know that eating\nrotten meat can make people sick. If Don feeds the rotten meat to his\nlittle sister, and it makes her sick, then the bad consequences are\nnot intended, foreseen, or even foreseeable by Don, but those bad\nresults are still objectively likely or probable,\nunlike the case of Alice. Some philosophers deny that probability can\nbe fully objective, but at least the consequences here are foreseeable\nby others who are more informed than Don can be at the time. For Don\nto feed the rotten meat to his sister is, therefore, morally wrong if\nlikely consequences are what matter, but not morally wrong if what\nmatter are foreseen or foreseeable or intended consequences.\n\nConsequentialist moral theories that focus on actual or objectively\nprobable consequences are often described as objective\nconsequentialism (Railton 1984). In contrast, consequentialist\nmoral theories that focus on intended or foreseen consequences are\nusually described as subjective consequentialism.\nConsequentialist moral theories that focus on reasonably foreseeable\nconsequences are then not subjective insofar as they do not depend on\nanything inside the actual subject\u2019s mind, but they are\nsubjective insofar as they do depend on which consequences this\nparticular subject would foresee if he or she were better informed or\nmore rational.\n\nOne final solution to these epistemological problems deploys the legal\nnotion of proximate cause. If consequentialists define consequences in\nterms of what is caused (unlike Sosa 1993), then which future events\ncount as consequences is affected by which notion of causation is used\nto define consequences. Suppose I give a set of steak knives to a\nfriend. Unforeseeably, when she opens my present, the decorative\npattern on the knives somehow reminds her of something horrible that\nher husband did. This memory makes her so angry that she voluntarily\nstabs and kills him with one of the knives. She would not have killed\nher husband if I had given her spoons instead of knives. Did my\ndecision or my act of giving her knives cause her husband\u2019s\ndeath? Most people (and the law) would say that the cause was her act,\nnot mine. Why? One explanation is that her voluntary act intervened in\nthe causal chain between my act and her husband\u2019s death.\nMoreover, even if she did not voluntarily kill him, but instead she\nslipped and fell on the knives, thereby killing herself, my gift would\nstill not be a cause of her death, because the coincidence of her\nfalling intervened between my act and her death. The point is that,\nwhen voluntary acts and coincidences intervene in certain causal\nchains, then the results are not seen as caused by the acts further\nback in the chain of necessary conditions (Hart and Honor\u00e9\n1985). Now, if we assume that an act must be such a proximate cause of\na harm in order for that harm to be a consequence of that act, then\nconsequentialists can claim that the moral rightness of that act is\ndetermined only by such proximate consequences. This position, which\nmight be called proximate consequentialism, makes it much\neasier for agents and observers to justify moral judgments of acts\nbecause it obviates the need to predict non-proximate consequences in\ndistant times and places. Hence, this move is worth considering, even\nthough it has never been developed as far as I know and deviates far\nfrom traditional consequentialism, which counts not only proximate\nconsequences but all upshots \u2014 that is, everything for which the\nact is a causally necessary condition.\n5. Consequences of What? Rights, Relativity, and Rules\n\nAnother problem for utilitarianism is that it seems to overlook\njustice and rights. One common illustration is called Transplant.\nImagine that each of five patients in a hospital will die without an\norgan transplant. The patient in Room 1 needs a heart, the patient in\nRoom 2 needs a liver, the patient in Room 3 needs a kidney, and so on.\nThe person in Room 6 is in the hospital for routine tests. Luckily\n(for them, not for him!), his tissue is compatible with the other five\npatients, and a specialist is available to transplant his organs into\nthe other five. This operation would save all five of their lives,\nwhile killing the \u201cdonor\u201d. There is no other way to save\nany of the other five patients (Foot 1966, Thomson 1976; compare\nrelated cases in Carritt 1947 and McCloskey 1965).\n\nWe need to add that the organ recipients will emerge healthy, the\nsource of the organs will remain secret, the doctor won\u2019t be\ncaught or punished for cutting up the \u201cdonor\u201d, and the\ndoctor knows all of this to a high degree of probability (despite the\nfact that many others will help in the operation). Still, with the\nright details filled in (no matter how unrealistic), it looks as if\ncutting up the \u201cdonor\u201d will maximize utility, since five\nlives have more utility than one life (assuming that the five lives do\nnot contribute too much to overpopulation). If so, then classical\nutilitarianism implies that it would not be morally wrong for the\ndoctor to perform the transplant and even that it would be morally\nwrong for the doctor not to perform the transplant. Most people find\nthis result abominable. They take this example to show how bad it can\nbe when utilitarians overlook individual rights, such as the unwilling\ndonor\u2019s right to life.\n\nUtilitarians can bite the bullet, again. They can deny that it is\nmorally wrong to cut up the \u201cdonor\u201d in these\ncircumstances. Of course, doctors still should not cut up their\npatients in anything close to normal circumstances, but this example\nis so abnormal and unrealistic that we should not expect our normal\nmoral rules to apply, and we should not trust our moral intuitions,\nwhich evolved to fit normal situations (Sprigge 1965). Many\nutilitarians are happy to reject common moral intuitions in this case,\nlike many others (cf. Singer 1974, Unger 1996, Norcross 1997).\n\nMost utilitarians lack such strong stomachs (or teeth), so they modify\nutilitarianism to bring it in line with common moral intuitions,\nincluding the intuition that doctors should not cut up innocent\npatients. One attempt claims that a killing is worse than a death. The\ndoctor would have to kill the \u201cdonor\u201d in order to prevent\nthe deaths of the five patients, but nobody is killed if the five\npatients die. If one killing is worse than five deaths that do not\ninvolve killing, then the world that results from the doctor\nperforming the transplant is worse than the world that results from\nthe doctor not performing the transplant. With this new theory of\nvalue, consequentialists can agree with others that it is morally\nwrong for the doctor to cut up the \u201cdonor\u201d in this\nexample.\n\nA modified example still seems problematic. Just suppose that the five\npatients need a kidney, a lung, a heart, and so forth because they\nwere all victims of murder attempts. Then the world will contain the\nfive killings of them if they die, but not if they do not die. Thus,\neven if killings are worse than deaths that are not killings, the\nworld will still be better overall (because it will contain fewer\nkillings as well as fewer deaths) if the doctor cuts up the\n\u201cdonor\u201d to save the five other patients. But most people\nstill think it would be morally wrong for the doctor to kill the one\nto prevent the five killings. The reason is that it is not the doctor\nwho kills the five, and the doctor\u2019s duty seems to be to reduce\nthe amount of killing that she herself does. In this view, the doctor\nis not required to promote life or decrease death or even\ndecrease killing by other people. The doctor is, instead, required to\nhonor the value of life by not causing loss of life (cf.\nPettit 1997).\n\nThis kind of case leads some consequentialists to introduce\nagent-relativity into their theory of value (Sen 1982, Broome 1991,\nPortmore 2001, 2003, 2011). To apply a consequentialist moral theory,\nwe need to compare the world with the transplant to the world without\nthe transplant. If this comparative evaluation must be agent-neutral,\nthen, if an observer judges that the world with the transplant is\nbetter, the agent must make the same judgment, or else one of them is\nmistaken. However, if such evaluations can be agent-relative, then it\ncould be legitimate for an observer to judge that the world with the\ntransplant is better (since it contains fewer killings by anyone),\nwhile it is also legitimate for the doctor as agent to judge that the\nworld with the transplant is worse (because it includes a killing\nby him). In other cases, such as competitions, it might\nmaximize the good from an agent\u2019s perspective to do an act,\nwhile maximizing the good from an observer\u2019s perspective to stop\nthe agent from doing that very act. If such agent-relative value makes\nsense, then it can be built into consequentialism to produce the claim\nthat an act is morally wrong if and only if the act\u2019s\nconsequences include less overall value from the perspective of the\nagent. This agent-relative consequentialism, plus the claim\nthat the world with the transplant is worse from the perspective of\nthe doctor, could justify the doctor\u2019s judgment that it would be\nmorally wrong for him to perform the transplant. A key move here is to\nadopt the agent\u2019s perspective in judging the agent\u2019s act.\nAgent-neutral consequentialists judge all acts from the\nobserver\u2019s perspective, so they would judge the doctor\u2019s\nact to be wrong, since the world with the transplant is better from an\nobserver\u2019s perspective. In contrast, an agent-relative approach\nrequires observers to adopt the doctor\u2019s perspective in judging\nwhether it would be morally wrong for the doctor to perform the\ntransplant. This kind of agent-relative consequentialism is then\nsupposed to capture commonsense moral intuitions in such cases\n(Portmore 2011).\n\nAgent-relativity is also supposed to solve other problems. W. D. Ross\n(1930, 34\u201335) argued that, if breaking a promise created only\nslightly more happiness overall than keeping the promise, then the\nagent morally ought to break the promise according to classic\nutilitarianism. This supposed counterexample cannot be avoided simply\nby claiming that keeping promises has agent-neutral value, since\nkeeping one promise might prevent someone else from keeping another\npromise. Still, agent-relative consequentialists can respond that\nkeeping a promise has great value from the perspective of the agent\nwho made the promise and chooses whether or not to keep it, so the\nworld where a promise is kept is better from the agent\u2019s\nperspective than another world where the promise is not kept, unless\nenough other values override the value of keeping the promise. In this\nway, agent-relative consequentialists can explain why agents morally\nought not to break their promises in just the kind of case that Ross\nraised.\n\nSimilarly, critics of utilitarianism often argue that utilitarians\ncannot be good friends, because a good friend places more weight on\nthe welfare of his or her friends than on the welfare of strangers,\nbut utilitarianism requires impartiality among all people. However,\nagent-relative consequentialists can assign more weight to the welfare\nof a friend of an agent when assessing the value of the consequences\nof that agent\u2019s acts. In this way, consequentialists try to\ncapture common moral intuitions about the duties of friendship (see\nalso Jackson 1991).\n\nOne final variation still causes trouble. Imagine that the doctor\nherself wounded the five people who need organs. If the doctor does\nnot save their lives, then she will have killed them herself. In this\ncase, even if the doctor can disvalue killings by herself more than\nkillings by other people, the world still seems better from her own\nperspective if she performs the transplant. Critics will object that\nit is, nonetheless, morally wrong for the doctor to perform the\ntransplant. Many people will not find this intuition as clear as in\nthe other cases, but consequentialists who do find it immoral for the\ndoctor to perform the transplant even in this case will need to modify\nconsequentialism in some other way in order to yield the desired\njudgment.\n\nThis problem cannot be solved by building rights or fairness or desert\ninto the theory of value. The five do not deserve to die, and they do\ndeserve their lives, just as much as the one does. Each option\nviolates someone\u2019s right not to be killed and is unfair to\nsomeone. So consequentialists need more than just new values if they\nwant to avoid endorsing this transplant.\n\nOne option is to go indirect. A direct consequentialist holds\nthat the moral qualities of something depend only on the consequences\nof that very thing. Thus, a direct consequentialist about motives\nholds that the moral qualities of a motive depend on the consequences\nof that motive. A direct consequentialist about virtues holds that the\nmoral qualities of a character trait (such as whether or not it is a\nmoral virtue) depend on the consequences of that trait (Driver 2001a,\nHurka 2001, Jamieson 2005, Bradley 2005). A direct consequentialist\nabout acts holds that the moral qualities of an act depend on the\nconsequences of that act. Someone who adopts direct consequentialism\nabout everything is a global direct consequentialist (Pettit\nand Smith 2000, Driver 2012).\n\nIn contrast, an indirect consequentialist holds that the\nmoral qualities of something depend on the consequences of something\nelse. One indirect version of consequentialism is motive\nconsequentialism, which claims that the moral qualities of an act\ndepend on the consequences of the motive of that act (compare Adams\n1976 and Sverdlik 2011). Another indirect version is virtue\nconsequentialism, which holds that whether an act is morally\nright depends on whether it stems from or expresses a state of\ncharacter that maximizes good consequences and, hence, is a\nvirtue.\n\nThe most common indirect consequentialism is rule\nconsequentialism, which makes the moral rightness of an act\ndepend on the consequences of a rule (Singer 1961). Since a rule is an\nabstract entity, a rule by itself strictly has no consequences. Still,\nobedience rule consequentialists can ask what would happen if\neverybody obeyed a rule or what would happen if everybody violated a\nrule. They might argue, for example, that theft is morally wrong\nbecause it would be disastrous if everybody broke a rule against\ntheft. Often, however, it does not seem morally wrong to break a rule\neven though it would cause disaster if everybody broke it. For\nexample, if everybody broke the rule \u201cHave some children\u201d,\nthen our species would die out, but that hardly shows it is morally\nwrong not to have any children. Luckily, our species will not die out\nif everyone is permitted not to have children, since enough people\nwant to have children. Thus, instead of asking, \u201cWhat would\nhappen if everybody did that?\u201d, rule consequentialists should\nask, \u201cWhat would happen if everybody were permitted to do\nthat?\u201d People are permitted to do what violates no accepted\nrule, so asking what would happen if everybody were permitted to do an\nact is just the flip side of asking what would happen if people\naccepted a rule that forbids that act. Such acceptance rule\nconsequentialists then claim that an act is morally wrong if and\nonly if it violates a rule whose acceptance has better consequences\nthan the acceptance of any incompatible rule. In some accounts, a rule\nis accepted when it is built into individual consciences (Brandt\n1992). Other rule utilitarians, however, require that moral rules be\npublicly known (Gert 2005; cf. Sinnott-Armstrong 2003b) or built into\npublic institutions (Rawls 1955). Then they hold what can be called\npublic acceptance rule consequentialism: an act is morally\nwrong if and only if it violates a rule whose public acceptance\nmaximizes the good.\n\nThe indirectness of such rule utilitarianism provides a way to remain\nconsequentialist and yet capture the common moral intuition that it is\nimmoral to perform the transplant in the above situation. Suppose\npeople generally accepted a rule that allows a doctor to transplant\norgans from a healthy person without consent when the doctor believes\nthat this transplant will maximize utility. Widely accepting this rule\nwould lead to many transplants that do not maximize utility, since\ndoctors (like most people) are prone to errors in predicting\nconsequences and weighing utilities. Moreover, if the rule is publicly\nknown, then patients will fear that they might be used as organ\nsources, so they would be less likely to go to a doctor when they need\none. The medical profession depends on trust that this public rule\nwould undermine. For such reasons, some rule utilitarians conclude\nthat it would not maximize utility for people generally to accept a\nrule that allows doctors to transplant organs from unwilling donors.\nIf this claim is correct, then rule utilitarianism implies that it is\nmorally wrong for a particular doctor to use an unwilling donor, even\nfor a particular transplant that would have better consequences than\nany alternative even from the doctor\u2019s own perspective. Common\nmoral intuition is thereby preserved.\n\nRule utilitarianism faces several potential counterexamples (such as\nwhether public rules allowing slavery could sometimes maximize\nutility) and needs to be formulated more precisely (particularly in\norder to avoid collapsing into act-utilitarianism; cf. Lyons 1965).\nSuch details are discussed in another entry in this encyclopedia (see\nHooker on rule-consequentialism). Here I will just point out that\ndirect consequentialists find it convoluted and implausible to judge a\nparticular act by the consequences of something else (Smart 1956). Why\nshould mistakes by other doctors in other cases make this\ndoctor\u2019s act morally wrong, when this doctor knows for sure that\nhe is not mistaken in this case? Rule consequentialists can respond\nthat we should not claim special rights or permissions that we are not\nwilling to grant to every other person, and that it is arrogant to\nthink we are less prone to mistakes than other people are. However,\nthis doctor can reply that he is willing to give everyone the right to\nviolate the usual rules in the rare cases when they do know for sure\nthat violating those rules really maximizes utility. Anyway, even if\nrule utilitarianism accords with some common substantive moral\nintuitions, it still seems counterintuitive in other ways. This makes\nit worthwhile to consider how direct consequentialists can bring their\nviews in line with common moral intuitions, and whether they need to\ndo so.\n6. Consequences for Whom? Limiting the Demands of Morality\n\nAnother popular charge is that classic utilitarianism demands too\nmuch, because it requires us to do acts that are or should be moral\noptions (neither obligatory nor forbidden). (Scheffler 1982) For\nexample, imagine that my old shoes are serviceable but dirty, so I\nwant a new pair of shoes that costs $100. I could wear my old shoes\nand give the $100 to a charity that will use my money to save someone\nelse\u2019s life. It would seem to maximize utility for me to give\nthe $100 to the charity. If it is morally wrong to do anything other\nthan what maximizes utility, then it is morally wrong for me to buy\nthe shoes. But buying the shoes does not seem morally wrong. It might\nbe morally better to give the money to charity, but such contributions\nseem supererogatory, that is, above and beyond the call of duty. Of\ncourse, there are many more cases like this. When I watch television,\nI always (or almost always) could do more good by helping others, but\nit does not seem morally wrong to watch television. When I choose to\nteach philosophy rather than working for CARE or the Peace Corps, my\nchoice probably fails to maximize utility overall. If we were required\nto maximize utility, then we would have to make very different choices\nin many areas of our lives. The requirement to maximize utility, thus,\nstrikes many people as too demanding because it interferes with the\npersonal decisions that most of us feel should be left up to the\nindividual.\n\nSome utilitarians respond by arguing that we really are morally\nrequired to change our lives so as to do a lot more to increase\noverall utility (see Kagan 1989, P. Singer 1993, and Unger 1996). Such\nhard-liners claim that most of what most people do is morally wrong,\nbecause most people rarely maximize utility. Some such wrongdoing\nmight be blameless when agents act from innocent or even desirable\nmotives, but it is still supposed to be moral wrongdoing. Opponents of\nutilitarianism find this claim implausible, but it is not obvious that\ntheir counter-utilitarian intuitions are reliable or well-grounded\n(Murphy 2000, chs. 1\u20134; cf. Mulgan 2001, Singer 2005, Greene\n2013).\n\nOther utilitarians blunt the force of the demandingness objection by\nlimiting direct utilitarianism to what people morally ought\nto do. Even if we morally ought to maximize utility, it need not be\nmorally wrong to fail to maximize utility. John Stuart Mill, for\nexample, argued that an act is morally wrong only when both\nit fails to maximize utility and its agent is liable to punishment for\nthe failure (Mill 1861). It does not always maximize utility to punish\npeople for failing to maximize utility. Thus, on this view, it is not\nalways morally wrong to fail to do what one morally ought to do. If\nMill is correct about this, then utilitarians can say that we ought to\ngive much more to charity, but we are not required or obliged to do\nso, and failing to do so is not morally wrong (cf. Sinnott-Armstrong\n2005).\n\nMany utilitarians still want to avoid the claim that we morally ought\nto give so much to charity. One way around this claim uses a\nrule-utilitarian theory of what we morally ought to do. If it costs\ntoo much to internalize rules implying that we ought to give so much\nto charity, then, according to such rule-utilitarianism, it is not\ntrue that we ought to give so much to charity (Hooker 2000, ch.\n8).\n\nAnother route follows an agent-relative theory of value. If there is\nmore value in benefiting oneself or one\u2019s family and friends\nthan there is disvalue in letting strangers die (without killing\nthem), then spending resources on oneself or one\u2019s family and\nfriends would maximize the good. A problem is that such\nconsequentialism would seem to imply that we morally ought not to\ncontribute those resources to charity, although such contributions\nseem at least permissible.\n\nMore personal leeway could also be allowed by deploying the legal\nnotion of proximate causation. When a starving stranger would stay\nalive if and only if one contributed to a charity, contributing to the\ncharity still need not be the proximate cause of the stranger\u2019s\nlife, and failing to contribute need not be the proximate cause of his\nor her death. Thus, if an act is morally right when it includes the\nmost net good in its proximate consequences, then it might not be\nmorally wrong either to contribute to the charity or to fail to do so.\nThis potential position, as mentioned above, has not yet been\ndeveloped, as far as I know.\n\nYet another way to reach this conclusion is to give up maximization\nand to hold instead that we morally ought to do what creates enough\nutility. This position is often described as satisficing\nconsequentialism (Slote 1984). According to satisficing\nconsequentialism, it is not morally wrong to fail to contribute to a\ncharity if one contributes enough to other charities and if the money\nor time that one could contribute does create enough good, so it is\nnot just wasted. (For criticisms, see Bradley 2006.) A related\nposition is progressive consequentialism, which holds that we\nmorally ought to improve the world or make it better than it would be\nif we did nothing, but we don\u2019t have to improve it as much as we\ncan (Elliot and Jamieson, 2009). Both satisficing and progressive\nconsequentialism allow us to devote some of our time and money to\npersonal projects that do not maximize overall good.\n\nA more radical set of proposals confines consequentialism to\njudgements about how good an act is on a scale (Norcross 2006, 2020)\nor to degrees of wrongness and rightness (Sinhababu 2018). This\npositions are usually\u00a0described as scalar\nconsequentialism. A scalar consequentialist can refuse to say\nwhether it is absolutely right or wrong to give $1000 to charity, for\nexample, but still say that giving $1000 to charity is better and more\nright than giving only $100 and simultaneously worse and more wrong\nthan giving $10,000. A related contrastivist consequentialism\ncould say that one ought to give $1000 in contrast with $100 but not\nin contrast with $10,000 (cf. Snedegar 2017).\u00a0Such positions can\nalso hold that less or less severe negative sanctions are justified\nwhen an agent\u2019s act is worse than a smaller set of alternatives\ncompared to when the agent\u2019s act is worse than a larger set of\nalternatives. This approach then becomes less demanding, both because\nit sees less negative sanctions as justified when the agent fails to\ndo the best act possible, and also because it avoids saying that\neveryday actions are simply wrong without comparison to any set of\nalternatives.\n\nOpponents still object that all such consequentialist theories are\nmisdirected. When I decide to visit a friend instead of working for a\ncharity, I can know that my act is not immoral even if I have not\ncalculated that the visit will create enough overall good or that it\nwill improve the world. These critics hold that friendship requires us\nto do certain favors for friends without weighing our friends\u2019\nwelfare impartially against the welfare of strangers. Similarly, if I\nneed to choose between saving my drowning wife and saving a drowning\nstranger, it would be \u201cone thought too many\u201d (Williams\n1981) for me to calculate the consequences of each act. I morally\nshould save my wife straightaway without calculating utilities.\n\nIn response, utilitarians can remind critics that the principle of\nutility is intended as only a criterion of right and not as a decision\nprocedure, so utilitarianism does not imply that people ought to\ncalculate utilities before acting (Railton 1984). Consequentialists\ncan also allow the special perspective of a friend or spouse to be\nreflected in agent-relative value assessments (Sen 1982, Broome 1991,\nPortmore 2001, 2003) or probability assessments (Jackson 1991). It\nremains controversial, however, whether any form of consequentialism\ncan adequately incorporate common moral intuitions about\nfriendship.\n7. Arguments for Consequentialism\n\nEven if consequentialists can accommodate or explain away common moral\nintuitions, that might seem only to answer objections without yet\ngiving any positive reason to accept consequentialism. However, most\npeople begin with the presumption that we morally ought to\nmake the world better when we can. The question then is only whether\nany moral constraints or moral options need to be added to the basic\nconsequentialist factor in moral reasoning. (Kagan 1989, 1998) If no\nobjection reveals any need for anything beyond consequences, then\nconsequences alone seem to determine what is morally right or wrong,\njust as consequentialists claim.\n\nThis line of reasoning will not convince opponents who remain\nunsatisfied by consequentialist responses to objections. Moreover,\neven if consequentialists do respond adequately to every proposed\nobjection, that would not show that consequentialism is correct or\neven defensible. It might face new problems that nobody has yet\nrecognized. Even if every possible objection is refuted, we might have\nno reason to reject consequentialism but still no reason to accept\nit.\n\nIn case a positive reason is needed, consequentialists present a wide\nvariety of arguments. One common move attacks opponents. If the only\nplausible options in moral theory lie on a certain list (say,\nKantianism, contractarianism, virtue theory, pluralistic intuitionism,\nand consequentialism), then consequentialists can argue for their own\ntheory by criticizing the others. This disjunctive syllogism\nor process of elimination will be only as strong as the set\nof objections to the alternatives, and the argument fails if even one\ncompetitor survives. Moreover, the argument assumes that the original\nlist is complete. It is hard to see how that assumption could be\njustified.\n\nConsequentialism also might be supported by an inference to the\nbest explanation of our moral intuitions. This argument might\nsurprise those who think of consequentialism as counterintuitive, but\nin fact consequentialists can explain many moral intuitions that\ntrouble deontological theories. Moderate deontologists, for example,\noften judge that it is morally wrong to kill one person to save five\nbut not morally wrong to kill one person to save a million. They never\nspecify the line between what is morally wrong and what is not morally\nwrong, and it is hard to imagine any non-arbitrary way for\ndeontologists to justify a cutoff point. In contrast,\nconsequentialists can simply say that the line belongs wherever the\nbenefits most outweigh the costs, including any bad side effects (cf.\nSinnott-Armstrong 2007). Similarly, when two promises conflict, it\noften seems clear which one we should keep, and that intuition can\noften be explained by the amount of harm that would be caused by\nbreaking each promise. In contrast, deontologists are hard pressed to\nexplain which promise is overriding if the reason to keep each promise\nis simply that it was made (Sinnott-Armstrong 2009). If\nconsequentialists can better explain more common moral intuitions,\nthen consequentialism might have more explanatory coherence overall,\ndespite being counterintuitive in some cases. (Compare Sidgwick 1907,\nBook IV, Chap. III; and Sverdlik 2011.) And even if act\nconsequentialists cannot argue in this way, it still might work for\nrule consequentialists (such as Hooker 2000).\n\nConsequentialists also might be supported by deductive\narguments from abstract moral intuitions. Sidgwick (1907, Book III,\nChap. XIII) seemed to think that the principle of utility follows from\ncertain very general self-evident principles, including\nuniversalizability (if an act ought to be done, then every other act\nthat resembles it in all relevant respects also ought to be done),\nrationality (one ought to aim at the good generally rather than at any\nparticular part of the good), and equality (\u201cthe good of any one\nindividual is of no more importance, from the point of view ... of the\nUniverse, than the good of any other\u201d).\n\nOther consequentialists are more skeptical about moral intuitions, so\nthey seek foundations outside morality, either in non-normative facts\nor in non-moral norms. Mill (1861) is infamous for his\n\u201cproof\u201d of the principle of utility from empirical\nobservations about what we desire (cf. Sayre-McCord 2001). In\ncontrast, Hare (1963, 1981) tries to derive his version of\nutilitarianism from substantively neutral accounts of morality, of\nmoral language, and of rationality (cf. Sinnott-Armstrong 2001).\nSimilarly, Gewirth (1978) tries to derive his variant of\nconsequentialism from metaphysical truths about actions.\n\nYet another argument for a kind of consequentialism is\ncontractarian. Harsanyi (1977, 1978) argues that all\ninformed, rational people whose impartiality is ensured because they\ndo not know their place in society would favor a kind of\nconsequentialism. Broome (1991) elaborates and extends\nHarsanyi\u2019s argument.\n\nOther forms of arguments have also been invoked on behalf of\nconsequentialism (e.g. Cummiskey 1996, P. Singer 1993;\nSinnott-Armstrong 1992). However, each of these arguments has also\nbeen subjected to criticisms.\n\nEven if none of these arguments proves consequentialism, there still\nmight be no adequate reason to deny consequentialism. We might have no\nreason either to deny consequentialism or to assert it.\nConsequentialism could then remain a live option even if it is not\nproven.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, R.M., 1976. \u201cMotive Utilitarianism\u201d,\n<em>Journal of Philosophy</em>, 73: 467\u201381.", "Adler, M., and Norheim, O.
