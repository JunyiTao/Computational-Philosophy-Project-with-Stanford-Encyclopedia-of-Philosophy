    "main_text": "The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika System of Categories || Methodology and Theory of Definition\n1.1 Methodology and Theory of Definition\n\nMost Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika texts are structured in one of\ntwo ways. They either follow a traditional Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\npattern, in which the categories and their various sub-groups are\ndiscussed in order, or else they follow a pattern employed by the\nBuddhist logician Di\u1e45n\u0101ga, and copied by\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, in which each of the sources of knowledge is\ntreated in turn. The Manual of Reason, however, adopts a\nstyle of analysis due to V\u0101tsy\u0101yana (the first commentator\non the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra). V\u0101tsy\u0101yana stated\nthat:\n\nThis [Ny\u0101ya] system will follow a three-fold procedure, viz.\nenumeration (udde\u015ba), definition\n(lak\u1e63a\u1e47a) and examination\n(par\u012bk\u1e63\u0101). Of these,\n\u2018enumeration\u2019 means the act of referring to each object\n[to be analysed] by name; \u2018definition\u2019 means [citing] a\ncharacteristic of the named object which distinguishes it from all\nother objects; \u2018examination\u2019 means ascertaining, with the\nhelp of the pram\u0101\u1e47as, the appropriateness of the\ndistinguishing characteristic for the object defined\n(Bh\u0101\u1e63ya before NS 1.1.3).\n\n\nThe heart of this method lies in the use it makes of definitions,\nconceived of as differentiating marks of the thing defined. The\nManual of Reason (TSD 3d) refines the idea: it defines a\n\u2018definition\u2019 of a class of things as any characteristic\nwhich is co-extensive with that class. A defining characteristic of\nthe class \u2018cow\u2019 is the property \u2018having\ndewlap\u2019. Note that this does not tell us what the\nessence of the class is\u2014it merely supplies us with a\nsyndrome or trait by means of which we can identify the thing\nin question. The Naiy\u0101yikas, we might say, have a\n\u2018diagnostic\u2019, rather than an \u2018essentialist\u2019,\nconception of definition. The purpose of the \u2018examination\u2019\nnow becomes clear: it is to see whether the alleged defining trait\nreally is co-extensive with the class to be defined, or whether it is\nfaulty, either by \u2018over-covering\u2019 (cf.\nativy\u0101pti; applying to things outside the definiendum)\nor by \u2018under-covering\u2019 (cf. avy\u0101pti; not\napplying to everything within the definiendum), or both. A properly\ndefining characteristic has to be, to use modern terms, both a\nnecessary and a sufficient property of the thing to be defined. We see\nthe pattern of enumeration, definition, and examination repeated again\nand again in Navya-Ny\u0101ya texts like The Manual of\nReason.\n",
