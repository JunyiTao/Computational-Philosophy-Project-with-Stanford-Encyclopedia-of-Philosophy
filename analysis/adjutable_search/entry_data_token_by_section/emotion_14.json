    "main_text": "The Motivational Tradition in Recent Philosophy || Enactivist Theories of Emotions: Emotions as Enactions\n9.2 Enactivist Theories of Emotions: Emotions as Enactions\n\nEnactivism is an interdisciplinary research program which begins with\ndissatisfaction with the way cognitive processes have long been\nstudied in cognitive science (Di Paolo & Thompson\n2014; Gallagher 2017). Two enactivist themes in particular are relevant for emotion\ntheory. The first is the focus on the active role played by the\ncognizer in his or her relation with the external world, which is for\nenactivists not given and passively detected but rather\nenacted and actively shaped by the \u201csense making\u201d\npowers of the cognizer. This \u201csense making\u201d activity is at\nthe heart of cognition as enactivists understand it, and it is\navailable to all living beings, no matter how simple they may be,\ninsofar as they are autonomous and adaptive systems (Thompson 2007).\n\n\nThe second theme is the focus on the embodied,\nembedded and extended character of cognitive\nprocesses (the theme of embodiment looms large in affective\nscience as well; see, e.g., Niedenthal 2007; Wilson-Mendenhall et al. 2011; Carr et al. forthcoming).\nWhereas traditional cognitive science and neuroscience have focused on\nthe brain in isolation from the rest of the body and from the\nenvironment, enactivists argue that we will fail to understand\ncognition if we neglect the reciprocal causal interactions between\nbrain, body and environment as they dynamically unfold over time.\n\nThe idea that complex cognitive abilities can rely on the scaffolding\nprovided by the external environment has proven especially popular\namong emotion theorists. It has led on the one hand to a renewed\nattention to the role played by interpersonal communication in social\nenvironments (Griffiths & Scarantino 2009), and on the other hand\nto the suggestion that emotions are ontologically extended beyond the\nnarrow confines of the cranium (Stephan et al. 2014; Krueger 2014;\nColombetti & Roberts 2015; Colombetti 2017).\n\nTo which tradition of research do enactivist theories of emotions\nbelong? The focus on experience might appear to nudge enactivism\ntowards the Feeling Tradition (see, e.g., Ratcliffe 2008). Enactivism\nis indeed influenced by the notion, central to the phenomenological\nphilosophical tradition, that the body is an experienced\nstructure (Husserl 1952 [1989]; Merleau-Ponty 1945 [1962]) rather than\nsimply a physical structure. And what we can experience\nlimits the world we inhabit, our \u201cUmwelt\u201d (Uexk\u00fcll\n(1934 [2010]).\n\nColombetti (2014) has made the case that the phenomenological\ntradition can enrich the affective neuroscience of emotions. Relying\non Varela\u2019s (1996) method of neurophenomenology,\nColombetti has developed a framework for integrating third-person\nmethods like brain imaging with first-person methods like\nself-reports. It is also quite clear that enactivists, in opposition\nto the \u201cdisembodied stance\u201d (Colombetti & Thompson\n2008) of many cognitivist theories, view emotions as bodily and\nexperiential processes rather than intellectual ones.\n\nNevertheless, it is more appropriate to slot the enactivist movement\ninto the phenomenological side of the Motivational Tradition. This is\nbecause enactivists also greatly emphasize the role of action\nin cognition. A number of them have recently offered accounts of\nemotions that emphasize their action-oriented nature (Hufendiek 2016;\nSlaby & W\u00fcschner 2014; Shargel & Prinz 2018). Cognition\nis said to be enacted by inherently teleological living systems for\nthe purposes of action. More radically, some cognitive processes like\nperception are described as constitutively dependent on motoric\nprocesses, as in the sensorimotor theory of visual consciousness\n(Hurley 1998; O\u2019Regan & No\u00eb 2001).\n\nThere is no unified understanding of the relation between emotions and\naction among enactivists, but rather a number of distinct proposals.\nIn Colombetti\u2019s work, for instance, the notion of\nself-organization plays an orienting role. Her view is that\nemotional episodes are \u201cself-organizing patterns of the\norganism, best described with the conceptual tools of dynamical\nsystems theory\u201d, a branch of mathematics designed to account for\nthe temporal evolution of systems that change over time (Colombetti\n2014: 53; see also Lewis 2005).\n\nSelf-organization is the capacity of a complex system to reach and\npreserve a state of order through reciprocal causal influences among\nsimpler component parts. When applied to the emotions, the idea is\nthat emotion components self-organize, which helps explain the\nvariability of emotional episodes, because self-organizing systems can\nend up in multiple end states depending on how their components\ninteract (see A. Clark 2001: 113\u2013114).\n\nAlthough there are analogies between this view and psychological\nconstructionism, especially with respect to the emphasis on emotions\nas emergent and flexible phenomena, Colombetti denies that conceptual\nacts bring about emotions, assuming that \u201csense making\u201d is\na much more primitive phenomenon available from bacteria to humans.\nCreatures engage in \u201csense making\u201d when they assess the\nenvironment in terms of whether it promotes their self-maintenance,\nand act so as to improve their viability within the environment, as a\nbacterium does when swimming away from a noxious substance.\n\nAt the same time, Colombetti uses the assumption of self-organization\nof emotional phenomena to oppose the notion that emotional episodes\nare caused either by affect programs (contra the basic emotion\ntradition) or by appraisals (contra the appraisal tradition).\nIncidentally, Colombetti (2014) thinks that the very notion of basic\nemotion is arbitrary and not worth keeping because it discourages\nresearch on the neural, behavioral, and bodily features of allegedly\nnon-basic emotions. Hufendiek (2016) makes the complementary case that\nallegedly non-basic emotions manifest a great many of the\ncharacteristics distinctive of basic emotions (see also J. Clark\n2010).\n\nAnother distinctive feature of enactivism is its\nanti-representational stance (Varela et al., 1991; Hutto\n& Myin 2013; Gallagher 2017). For example, Hutto (2012) has proposed that\n\u201cwe let go of the idea that emotions represent situations in\ntruth-evaluable ways\u201d (2012: 4), suggesting that emotions do not\nrepresent core relational themes. For instance, fear does not\nrepresent that there is danger at hand, and anger does not represent\nthat there has been a slight against me or mine. Hutto\u2019s (2012)\nmain concern with respect to ascribing representational powers to\nemotions is that such powers are posited despite not having\nexplanatory value (see Hufendiek 2018 for discussion). Specifically,\nHutto (2012) follows Ramsey (2007) in assuming that a mental state\ncounts as a representation only if it is consumed by other systems in\nlight of what it says or indicates, and concludes that emotions fail\nto play this larger explanatory role in the cognitive economy of the\norganism and should therefore not be considered representations.\n\nPrinz (2004) used to think that emotions represent core relational\nthemes because they have the function of correlating with them, but in\nhis recent work he has changed his mind. Schargel and Prinz (2018)\nhave argued that a teleosemantic approach is a threat to the truly\nembodied character of a theory of emotions in the James-Lange mold,\nthe approach they favor. This is because any non-embodied\nvehicle\u2014e.g., a disembodied judgment\u2014that has the function\nof correlating with a core relational theme would just as well\nrepresent such theme as an embodied vehicle does (Shargel 2014).\n\nAs an alternative, Shargel and Prinz (2018) embrace a\nnon-representational, enactivist theory of content for emotions,\naccording to which emotions create, by virtue of the bodily\npreparation they involve, action possibilities (see also Griffiths\n& Scarantino 2009; Hufendiek 2016). These action possibilities,\nunlike standard affordances in the Gibsonian tradition, which\npre-exist emotions and are motivationally inert, are\n\u201cstate-dependent (they typically arise only once the emotion has\nbeen initiated), and imperatival (they motivate action)\u201d\n(Shargel & Prinz 2018: 119). On this view, fear generates\npossibilities for escape which would not be there in the absence of\nfear, and which work as dynamic attractors, pulling the agent towards\nescape. The enactive content of fear, then, is not danger, but the\npresentation of a certain situation as something to be escaped,\njointly with an impulse to move away from it, a content that is\nessentially embodied since it involves bodily preparation for\nescape.\n\nA central challenge for enactivist theories of emotions of the\nnon-representational variety is to account for our normative practices\nwith respect to emotions. Once we realize that someone\u2019s fear\nmoved him or her to avoid a certain state of affairs, or that\nsomeone\u2019s anger motivated him or her to attack someone, we still\nask whether or not what motivated avoidance is a danger and whether or\nnot what motivated retribution is a slight. In other words, we still\ntreat emotions as appropriate and inappropriate with respect to their\ncircumstances of elicitation, and it is an open question if and how\nthese forms of appropriateness can be made sense of if emotions do not\nrepresent core relational themes (see Hufendiek 2016, 2017, 2018 for\nfurther discussion).\n",
