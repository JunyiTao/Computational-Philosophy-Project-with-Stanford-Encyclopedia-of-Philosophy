Anomalies, Paradoxes, and Problems\n\nSome of the fundamental issues in philosophy of Information are\nclosely related to existing philosophical problems, others seem to be\nnew. In this paragraph we discuss a number of observations that may\ndetermine the future research agenda. Some relevant questions are:\n\nAre there uniquely identifying descriptions that do not contain\nall information about the object they refer to?\nDoes computation create new information? \nIs there a difference between construction and systematic search?\n\n\n\nSince Frege most mathematicians seem to believe that the answer to the\nfirst question is positive (Frege 1879, 1892). The descriptions\n\u201cThe morning star\u201d and \u201cThe evening star\u201d are\nassociated with procedures to identify the planet Venus, but\nthey do not give access to all information about the object itself. If\nthis were so the discovery that the evening star is in fact also the\nmorning star would be uninformative. If we want to maintain this\nposition we get into conflict, because in terms of information theory\nthe answer to the second question is negative (see\n section 5.1.7).\n Yet this observation is highly counter intuitive, because it implies\nthat we never can construct new information on the basis of\ndeterministic computation, which leads to the third question. These\nissues cluster around one of the fundamental open problems of\nPhilosophy of Information: \n\nOpen problem What is the interaction between\nInformation and Computation? \n\nWhy would we compute at all, if according to our known information\nmeasures, deterministic computing does not produce new information?\nThe question could be rephrased as: should we use Kolmogorov or Levin\ncomplexity (Levin 1973, 1974, 1984) as our basic information measure?\nIn fact both choices lead to relevant, but fundamentally different,\ntheories of information. When using the Levin measure, computing\ngenerates information and the answer to the three questions above is a\n\u201cyes\u201d, when using Kolmogorov this is not the case. The\nquestions are related to many problems both in mathematics and\ncomputer science. Related issues like approximation, computability and\npartial information are also studied in the context of Scott domains\n(Abramsky & Jung 1994). Below we discuss some relevant\nobservations. \n",
