    "main_text": "Logic and method || Logic as an art\n3.1 Logic as an art\n\nLogic, according to the Ramist and Stoic perspective, is a part of\nphilosophy. Ramus rejected the Aristotelian definition of logic as a\nhabitus instrumentalis, since an instrumental attitude could\nbe considered to be an effect of logic but not equivalent to it.\nInstead he defined logic as the ars bene disserendi, the art\nof correctly discussing or analyzing something. Consequently, Ramus\nthought that logic was about being, which made the discipline of metaphysics\nsuperfluous.\n\nOne of the logic books that students had for centuries studied was the\nSummulae logicales of Petrus Hispanus (probably the same\nPetrus who was elected pope in 1276 and adopted the name John XXI).\nEven in the beginning of the sixteenth century the treatise was still\nin use and attracted severe criticism from humanists. Ramus stated\nexplicitly that he wanted to remove the Summulae from the\ncurriculum, and it was mainly this book that he was thinking about\nwhen he lamented his own youthful experiences of studying logic. His\ndevastating judgment on the book was that it had not made him \n\n\nmore judicious in his studies of history and antiquity, nor more\nskilled in disputation, nor more competent at writing poetry, nor\nindeed more competent at anything at all\u2026. (Ramus, Scholae\ndialecticae, in Scholae in liberales artes, col. 153)\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Ramus\u2019 own dialectic showed many signs of\ninfluence from Summulae. Therefore, to understand the\ndevelopment of Ramist logic, we have to pay attention to this\nscholastic background, as well as to Cicero, who played a key role in\nthe advance of humanist logic.\n\nThe three main parts of Aristotle\u2019s great work on logic, the\nOrganon, are represented by the Categories, the\nPrior and Posterior Analytics and the\nTopics. The categories (praedicamenta) are not only\ntreated as a formal part of a proposition but also, and most\nimportantly, as universals, which meant that their ontological status\nalso had to be considered. The other two parts of Aristotle\u2019s\nlogic dealt with the problems of how to reach scientific and\ndialectical conclusions respectively: the Analytics is about\nfinding correct axioms and using them to acquire scientific knowledge;\nthe Topics teaches us how to discuss and treat those issues\nwhere it is impossible to attain the truth, so that we have to be\nsatisfied with seeking what is most probable.\n\n",
