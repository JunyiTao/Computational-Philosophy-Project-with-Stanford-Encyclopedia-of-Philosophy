To begin with the first of those: Jackson\u2019s\ncharacter Mary, a brilliant color scientist trapped in an entirely\nblack-and-white laboratory, nonetheless becomes omniscient as regards\nthe physics and chemistry of color, the neurophysiology of color\nvision, and every other public, objective fact conceivably relevant to\nhuman color experience. Yet when she is finally released from her\ncaptivity and ventures into the outside world, she sees colors for the\nfirst time, and learns something: namely, she learns what it is like\nto see red and the other colors. Thus she seems to have learned a new\nfact, one that by hypothesis is not a public, objective fact. It is an\nintrinsically perspectival fact. This is what threatens materialism,\nsince according to that doctrine, every fact about every human mind is\nultimately a public, objective fact.\n\nUpon her release, Mary has done two things: She has at last hosted a\nred sensory quality, and she has learned what it is like to experience\na red quality. In experiencing it she has experienced a \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like\u201d in the first of our two senses. But the fact\nshe has learned has the ineffability characteristic of our second\nsense of \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d; were Mary to try to pass\non her new knowledge of a WIL property to a still color-deprived\ncolleague, she would not be able to express it in English.\n\nWe have already surveyed the representational theory of sensory\nqualities. But there are also representational theories of \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like\u201d in the second sense (4). A common reply to the\narguments of Nagel and Jackson (Horgan (1984), Van Gulick (1985),\nChurchland (1985), Tye (1986), Lycan (1987, 1990, 1996, 2003), Loar\n(1990), Rey (1991), Leeds (1993)) is to note that a knowledge\ndifference does not entail a difference in fact known, for one can\nknow a fact under one representation or mode of presentation but fail\nto know one and the same fact under a different mode of presentation.\nSomeone might know that water is splashing but not know that\nH2O molecules are moving, and vice versa; someone might\nknow that person X is underpaid without knowing that she herself is\nunderpaid, even if she herself is in fact person X. Thus, from\nMary\u2019s before-and-after knowledge difference, Jackson is not\nentitled to infer the existence of a new, weird fact, but at most that\nof a new way of representing. Mary has not learned a new fact, but has\nonly acquired a new, introspective or first-person way of representing\none that she already knew in its neurophysiological guise.\n\n(As noted above, the posited introspective modes of presentation for\nsensory qualities in the first-order sense are strong candidates for\nthe title of \u201cqualia\u201d in a distinct, higher-order sense of\nthe term, and they may well be narrow rather than wide. This is what\nRey (1998) seems to be talking about.)\n\nThis attractive response to Nagel and Jackson\u2014call it the\n\u201cperspectivalist\u201d response\u2014requires that the\nfirst-order qualitative state itself be represented (else how could it\nbe newly known under Mary\u2019s new mode of presentation?). And that\nhypothesis in turn encourages a representational theory of\nhigher-order conscious awareness and introspection. However,\nrepresentational theories of awareness face powerful objections, the\nperspectivalist must either buy into such a theory despite its\nliabilities, or find some other way of explicating the idea of an\nintrospective or first-person perspective without appealing to\nhigher-order representation. The latter option does not seem\npromising. And a further question raised by the perspectivalist\nresponse concerns the nature of the alleged first-person\nrepresentation itself.\n\nIt has become popular, especially among materialists, to speak of\n\u201cphenomenal concepts,\u201dand to suppose that Mary has\nacquired one which she can now apply to her first-order qualitative\nstate; it is in that way that she is able to represent the old fact in\na new way. Phenomenal concepts figure also in responses to the\nConceivability and Explanatory Gap arguments.\n\nThe Conceivability argument (Chalmers 1996, 2003) has it that\n\u201czombies\u201d are conceivable\u2014physical duplicates of\nordinary human beings, that share all the human physical and\nfunctional states but lack phenomenal consciousness in sense (4);\nthere is nothing it is like to be a zombie. The argument then moves\nfrom bare conceivability to genuine metaphysical possibility, which\nwould refute materialism. According to the Explanatory Gap argument\n(Levine 1983, 2001), no amount of physical, functional or other\nobjective information could explain why a given sensory state feels to\nits subject in the way it does, and the best explanation of this in\nturn is that the feel is an extra fact that does not supervene on the\nphysical.\n\nLormand (2004) offers a very detailed linguistic analysis of the\nformula \u201cThere is something it is like for [creature] c\nto have [mental state] M,\u201d and on its basis defends the claim\nthat instances of that formula as well as more specific attributions\nof WIL properties can in fact be conceptually deduced at least from\n\u201cnonphenomenal\u201d facts about subjects.\n\nWhat the Knowledge, Conceivability and Explanatory Gap arguments have\nin common is that they move from an alleged epistemic gap to a\nwould-be materialism-refuting metaphysical one. Though some\nmaterialists balk at once and refuse to admit the epistemic gap, more\ngrant the epistemic gap and resist the move to the metaphysical one.\nThe epistemic gap, on this view, is created by the \u201cconceptual\nisolation\u201d of phenomenal concepts from all others, and it is\nconceptual only rather than metaphysical. Stoljar (2005) calls this\nthe \u201cphenomenal concept strategy\u201d. There are a number of\ndistinct positive accounts of phenomenal concepts and how they work;\nsuch concepts are: \u201crecognitional\u201d (Loar (1990),\nCarruthers (2000), Tye (2003c)); proprietary lexemes of an internal\nmonitoring system (Lycan (1996)); indexical (Perry (2001), O\u2019Dea\n(2002), Schellenberg (2013)); demonstrative (Levin (2007), Stalnaker\n(2008), Schroer (2010)); \u201cquotational\u201d or\n\u201cconstitutive\u201d (Papineau (2002), Balog (2012));\n\u201cunimodal\u201d (Dove and Elpidorou (2016)). Some of those\naccounts are minimal, aspiring only to block the key inferences in the\nanti-materialist arguments aforementioned. Others, particularly the\nconstitutive account, are more detailed and offer to explain more\nspecific features of WIL properties. For example, Papineau points out\nthat the constitutive account explains the odd persistent\nattractiveness of some of the obviously fallacious antimaterialist\narguments. He and Balog each argue that the account, according to\nwhich a phenomenal concept token is at least partly constituted by the\nvery mental state-token that is its referent, explains the special\ndirectness of the reference: no feature of the state is appealed to\n(and a fortiori no neural, functional, causal etc. feature);\nBalog adds that since the referent is literally contained and present\nin the concept token, \u201cthere will always be something it is\nlike\u201d to do the tokening (p. 7).\n\nThe phenomenal concept strategy is criticized by Raffman (1995),\nStoljar (2005), Prinz (2007), Chalmers (2007), Ball (2009), Tye\n(2009), Demircioglu (2013), and Shea (2014). For further works and\nreferences see Alter and Walter (2007), Sundstr\u00f6m (2011) and\nElpidorou (2015). Chalmers offers a \u201cMaster Argument\u201d\nmeant to refute any version of the strategy: it is a dilemma based on\nwhether it is conceivable that the complete fundamental physical truth\nholds yet we possess no phenomenal concepts (having whichever\nfeatures). The argument is criticized by Papineau (2007), Carruthers\nand Veillet (2007), and Balog (2012).\n",
