    "main_text": "General Theories of the Law of Contracts || Pluralism\n1.5 Pluralism\n\nThe criteria for measuring a contract theory\u2019s success remain\nvaguely defined, which is to be expected in an interpretive\nenterprise. We want our theory to fit and to explain contract law\ndoctrines that are themselves sometimes contested. In addition, we\nwant the law to be understood as worthy of our moral approval, with\nall the complexities and controversies that this involves. The\ncompeting theories of contract strike different balances between\nconsiderations of fit and justification and are based on competing\nviews about what the law is and what it should be. Moreover, the\ndifferences among the theories\u2014especially with respect to\njustification\u2014involve fundamental disagreements about value,\nwhich makes compromise elusive. Whether any balance can be sensibly\nstruck between, say, the value of promissory integrity and that of\nmaximizing the joint surplus from contractual exchange remains\nunclear.\n\nThe \u201cpluralist\u201d finds in this stalemate reasons to\nquestion whether contract law is animated by one evaluative goal or\nmaster principle, rather than a plurality of independent and perhaps\neven incommensurable evaluative aims. Pluralism is more often\npresupposed in the literature than directly defended, and what defense\nthere is usually takes the form of a critique of monistic views (see,\ne.g., Hillman 1998). The critique is qualified, however, since the\nmonistic views are portrayed as offering genuine even if incomplete\ninsights into contract law, contributing to the taxonomic project of\nmapping the values that undergird it (Hillman 1998; Klass 2008;\nKreitner 2012). For pluralism to be more than a negative thesis,\npluralists have considerable work to do in explaining contract\nlaw\u2019s plural commitments, ideally offering more than a grab-bag\nlist of values to be promoted (Lucy 2007).\n\nAn important question facing the pluralist is whether there are\nreasons for contract law\u2019s pluralism. The answer might seem\nobvious, as if it were lawyerly commonsense. The law of contracts has\ndeveloped over the course of several centuries, with many diverse\njuridical personalities disagreeing on how best to resolve contract\ndisputes. Some of the law\u2019s guiding principles have survived\nboth this competitive process and changing normative fashions in the\nbroader culture; others have been modified. The expectancy remedy and\npacta sunt servanda principles may be relics of a bygone\nage\u2019s commitment to bare promissory duty. But efficient breach\nand related doctrines have evolved to prevent promissory virtue from\ngetting in the way of social welfare, especially in economies marked\nby a high-frequency spot contracts among parties with no relationship\noutside of the contracts at issue. These tensions within contract law\nare, as one commentator puts it, \u201chistorical and political\naccidents\u201d (Alces 2008).\n\nBut there are also other explanatory possibilities. Contract\nlaw\u2019s distinctive pluralism may reflect an indeterminacy in the\nrealm of non-legal value. The promotion of promissory and\ncollaborative virtue, or general welfare, or careful promising to\navoid monetary harm, may be understood as falling largely within the\nrealm of the (institutional) supererogatory rather than the realm of\nduty or basic justice. And if there is genuine indeterminacy regarding\nhow these incompossible goods are to be integrated by a regime that\naspires to do what is best (rather than exclusively what is\nobligatory), then the character of contract law\u2019s pluralism\nmight be explained in terms of judges \u201csettling\u201d a\ngenuinely indeterminate moral question regarding the optimal\ninstitutional choice (Atiq 2018: 78, 88\u201397). Contract law is\nthus seen not as the incoherent end result of judges disagreeing on\nquestions of morality and the social good, but as a distinctly\njuridical solution to a genuine evaluative dilemma: quasi-legislative\nstipulation by judges of the precise mix of goods to be\ninstitutionally promoted. Law\u2019s usefulness in this regard,\nproviding closure on problems of value pluralism, has been explored\nmore generally in legal and political philosophy (see, e.g., Radbruch\n1932; Finnis 1980; Williams 1985; Waldron 1996, Berlin 2002).\n\nEven in this case, the central challenge facing the various strains of\npluralism remains in place: that of explaining how law integrates its\nseveral and often competing normative commitments. To what extent are\ndecisions informed by some \u201ccovering value\u201d, in Ruth\nChang\u2019s (2004) terminology, or synthesizing principles? A recent\nproposal suggests an organizing principle based on a typology of\ncontracts and contracting parties (Leib 2005). Wealth maximization may\nbe appropriate in the enforcement of contracts between firms, for\nexample, whereas promissory virtue becomes a more significant object\nof concern in contractual disputes between natural persons (see also\nC. Riley 2000). Along similar lines, Dagan and Heller (2017) suggest\nthat distinct contract-types implicate distinct values, and that the\norganizing principle that determines which normative structure applies\nis the choice principle\u2014the parties\u2019 freedom to choose the\nrules that govern their exchange relations. Such proposals sit\nuncomfortably with existing law, which does not explicitly distinguish\nthe application of its basic doctrines in this way, even if it\nshould.\n",
