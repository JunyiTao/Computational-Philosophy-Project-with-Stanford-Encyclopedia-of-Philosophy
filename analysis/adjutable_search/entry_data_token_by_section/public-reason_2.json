    "main_text": "Why Public Reason? || Autonomy\n1.2 Autonomy\n\nOn one prominent view, with both Kantian and Rousseauvian roots,\nfreedom requires that we obey only those laws or rules that we could\nrationally give to ourselves. To be subject to the will of others, or\nto the arbitrary forces of nature, is to be unfree. We thus express\nour nature as rational and autonomous beings by acting in accordance\nwith maxims that we could will to be universal laws, or we express our\npolitical autonomy by acting in accordance with those laws that appeal\nonly to the common good, and thereby represent the general will of all\ncitizens. Insofar as one holds this conception of autonomy to be of\nfundamental importance, autonomy might thus provide the basis for\npublic reason. By ensuring that our moral or political principles are\njustifiable or reasonably acceptable to all those to whom the\nprinciples apply, public reason appears to ensure that each of us is,\nin some important sense, governed only by principles that we can\nrationally give to ourselves. Some leading philosophers of public\nreason appear to make this connection between public reason and\nautonomy. Gaus, for example, appeals to Rousseau\u2019s statement\nthat the fundamental problem to which the social contract is meant to\nbe the solution is to find a way of imposing rules to regulate our\ncommon life \u201cin which each, while uniting himself with all, may\nstill obey himself alone, and remain as free as before\u201d (Gaus\n2011, 1. Also see Rawls 1996, 219; Neufeld 2022).\n\nBut the extent to which the appeal to autonomy can, on its own,\njustify the various features of public reason is uncertain, and many\nproponents of public reason do not explicitly present the appeal to\nKantian or Rousseauvian autonomy as the sole, or even primary, basis\nfor public reason. This may be partly explained by the fact that this\nconception of our autonomy, particularly insofar as it is presented as\npart of a broader account of our nature as rational beings, is\ncontroversial and the subject of reasonable disagreement (Weithman\n2002, 188\u2013191; Quong 2013). But for an attempt to develop an\nexplicitly political and civic account of autonomy with which to\nground public reason see (Neufeld 2022).\n",
