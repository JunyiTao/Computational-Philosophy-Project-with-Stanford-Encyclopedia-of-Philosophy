    "main_text": "Conflicts across time in the formerly competent\n3. Conflicts across time in the formerly competent\n\nThe orthodox view regarding the formerly competent faces deeper\nchallenges. In giving priority to Advance Directives and Substituted\nJudgment, the orthodox view overlooks the possibility that the earlier\ncompetent self and the current incompetent self may have conflicting\ninterests. Advance Directives and Substituted Judgment are best suited\nfor the contexts for which they were first developed in the law\n\u2014 conditions involving loss of consciousness such as persistent\nvegetative state \u2014 where the patient in the current incompetent\nstate cannot have interests potentially different from the interests\nof the person he used to be. However, loss of decision-making capacity\noften comes about in less drastic, yet permanent conditions, which can\nleave the current incompetent patient with what seem to be powerful\nnew interests in his new phase of life. Classic cases of this sort\noccur in Alzheimer's disease, other forms of dementia, and\nstroke. Before the loss of capacity, typically, the patient had\nnumerous interests associated with his rich mental life and with a\ncorrespondingly complex set of values. Once mental deterioration\nprogresses, the patient's universe of interests shrinks and new\ninterests may become dominant. Sometimes the two sets of interests can\ncome into conflict. Imagine, for example, a fully competent patient\nwho, in anticipation of developing Alzheimer's disease, espouses a\nstrong conviction, perhaps documented in an advance directive, that\nshe does not wish to have her life prolonged in a demented state. She\ndeeply identifies with her intellect, and thus views life with\ndementia as terribly degrading. But once she develops dementia, her\nidentification with her intellect drops out as a concern, so she loses\nthe corresponding desire not to prolong her life. In the meantime, she\nis still capable of simple enjoyments \u2014 she likes gardening or\nlistening to music \u2014 and perhaps can even carry on meaningful\nhuman attachments. Her current, truncated set of interests does seem\nto favor continued life. Such scenarios raise difficult questions of\nhow the interests of the earlier and current self ought to be balanced\nin surrogate decision-making. Privileging advance directives and\nrecreating the judgment of the earlier self via substituted judgment\nare no longer the obvious solutions, given this conflict.\n\nMuch of the philosophical literature on surrogate decision-making has\nfocused on conflicts of this kind. There are subtle differences,\nthough, in how this conflict is conceptualized \u2014 more\nspecifically, in how the interests of the earlier self are viewed\n\u2014 sometimes stemming from differences in what is taken as a\nparadigm example of the conflict. On one view, the relevant interests\nof the earlier self are autonomy interests: what matters is that the\nchoices of the earlier self be heeded. With this emphasis, the\nconflict is between the autonomy of the earlier self and the\nwell-being of the current self. On an alternative conception, the\ninterests of the earlier self are well-being interests: what matters\nis that the earlier self fares well overall. The conflict, then, is\nbetween the well-being of the earlier self and the well-being of the\ncurrent self. One may also consider both aspects of the conflict as\nrelevant. The arguments below apply to all three interpretations of\nthe conflict.\n",
