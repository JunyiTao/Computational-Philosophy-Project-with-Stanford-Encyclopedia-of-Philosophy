Major Themes in Milhamot Ha-shem\n\nIn the introduction to Milhamot, Gersonides specifies six\nquestions which he hopes to examine: Is the rational soul immortal?\nWhat is the nature of prophecy? Does God know particulars? Does divine\nprovidence extend to individuals? What is the nature of astronomical\nbodies? Is the universe eternal or created? Each question occupies a\nseparate book. Gersonides attempts to reconcile traditional Jewish\nbeliefs with what he feels are the strongest points in\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy. Although a synthesis of these systems is\nhis ultimate goal, philosophy often wins out at the expense of\ntheology.\n\nGersonides\u2019 attitude toward previous astronomers, coupled with\nhis faith in human reason, are reflected in his discussion of\ncreation. Maimonides went to great lengths to maintain that the topic\nof creation is beyond rational demonstration. Gersonides, on the other\nhand, devotes many chapters in Milhamot VI to proving that\nthe Platonic theory of creation out of an eternal formless matter is\nrationally demonstrable. The question of whether the universe was\ncreated or had existed from eternity had been treated by Maimonides in\nan ambiguous manner; scholars still disagree over whether Maimonides\nultimately upheld an Aristotelian, Platonic, or scriptural doctrine of\ncreation. Gersonides\u2019 position is unambiguously Platonic.\nGersonides argues that the world was created outside of time by a\nfreely willing agent. He must then decide whether the world was\nengendered ex nihilo or out of a preexistent matter. Arguing\nthat ex nihilo creation is incompatible with physical\nreality, he adopts a model drawn from Plato\u2019s Timaeus.\nGersonides interprets the opening of Genesis to refer to two types of\nmatter. Geshem is the primordial matter out of which the\nuniverse was created; not capable of motion or rest, it was\ncharacterized by negation and was inert and chaotic. This matter is\nidentified with the primeval waters described in Genesis.\nHomer is prime matter, in the Aristotelian sense of a\nsubstratum always aligned with form. It contains within itself the\npotentiality to receive forms but is not an ontologically independent\nentity. Gersonides compares this matter to darkness: just as darkness\nis the absence of light, this matter represents the absence of form or\nshape. As noted by Glasner (2015) and Freudenthal (1987), this notion\nof a body that does not preserve its shape offered several important\nadvantages. First, the space between the spheres, which is subject to\ncontinuous change, is filled by the body that does not preserve its\nshape, and so transmission can be explained by contact. Second, in the\ncontext of his theory of creation, this amorphous body is a remnant of\nthe pre-existent entity (thou va-vohu) from which God shaped the\nworld. On this basis Gersonides argues that the world was created out\nof an eternally preexistent matter.\n\nGersonides\u2019 cosmology forms the backdrop of the other books of\nMilhamot. His predecessor Maimonides had claimed that no\nvalid inference can be drawn from the nature of the sublunar sphere to\nthat of the superlunar sphere. Gersonides, however, rejects the\nmetaphysical bite to the distinction, and argues that inasmuch as both\nspheres contain material elements, what we know about creation is\nbased on astronomy, and astronomy is fundamentally no different a\nhuman science than physics. Astronomy can only be pursued as a science\nby \u201cone who is both a mathematician and a natural philosopher,\nfor he can be aided by both of these sciences and take from them\nwhatever is needed to perfect his work\u201d (Wars, V.1.1,\np. 23). Gersonides sees the ultimate function of astronomy to\nunderstand God. Astronomy, he tells us, is instructive not only by\nvirtue of its exalted subject matter, but also because of its utility\nin the other sciences. By studying the orbs and stars, we are led\nineluctably to a fuller knowledge and appreciation of God. Astronomy\nthus functions as the underpinning of the rest of the work.\n\nGersonides\u2019 discussion of immortality of the soul in book 1 must\nbe understood against the backdrop of a notoriously difficult passage\nin Aristotle\u2019s On the Soul, book 3, chapter 5\n(430a22\u201325). In this passage Aristotle seems to postulate the\nexistence of an active intellect which is separable from the passive\nintellect and which is primarily responsible for the intellectual\nactivities of the human soul. But what is the relation between the\nactive and passive intellects, and which, if either, is immortal?\nGersonides states and rejects three positions that elucidate a version\nof the unity of intellect. The import of Gersonides\u2019 critique of\nhis predecessors can be reduced to three main issues. From a\ntheological perspective, it is clear that the doctrine of unity of\nintellect threatens the notion of personal immortality. For if all\nhumans share the same intellect, then upon physical death, all that\nremains of the person is an unindividualized intellect.\nEpistemologically, the doctrine is unable to account for how it is\nthat two (or more) knowers can entertain contrary items of knowledge;\nor, more stringently, how one person can be mistaken about something\nanother person knows. And from a metaphysical perspective, the main\nproblem is how to individuate this separate intellect when it is\nmanifested in many individuals: for if it is individuated materially\non the basis that individual bodies differ, then the substance is no\nlonger incorporeal or separate. As Feldman has pointed out, on this\ntheory an incorporeal substance is either a unique member of a species\nor is not a member of a species at all (Wars, I.4, p.\n79).\n\nGersonides avoids these untoward consequences by adopting the position\nof Alexander of Aphrodisias. Gersonides agrees with Alexander of\nAphrodisias that immortality consists in the intellectual perfection\nof the material intellect. He disagrees with Alexander, however, over\nthe precise nature of this intellectual attainment. For Alexander\n(according to Gersonides) had claimed that immortality is achieved\nwhen the intellect acquires knowledge of the Agent Intellect (hence\nthe term \u201cacquired intellect\u201d is introduced). Immortality\nis thus understood by Alexander to be a form of conjunction between\nthe Agent and acquired intellects. \u201cThey [the followers of\nAlexander] maintain that the material intellect is capable of\nimmortality and subsistence when it reaches that level of perfection\nwhere the objects of knowledge that it apprehends are themselves\nintellects, in particular the Agent Intellect\u2026[material\nintellect] is immortal when it is united with the Agent\nIntellect\u201d (Wars, I.8, p. 170).\n\nGersonides rejects this notion of conjunction, however, and replaces\nit with a model of immortality according to which it is the content of\nknowledge of the acquired intellect that matters. When the content of\nthe acquired intellect mirrors the rational ordering of the Agent\nIntellect, immortality is achieved. What is the content of this\nknowledge? The Agent Intellect must possess complete knowledge of the\nsublunary world; that is, it \u201ccontains a conception of the\nrational order obtaining in all individuals\u201d (Wars,\nI.4, p. 136). The anti-Platonic tenor of this position is emphasized\nwhen Gersonides describes in more detail what it is that the Agent\nIntellect knows. For according to Gersonides, the knowledge of the\nAgent Intellect must be grounded in the domain of particulars. Thus\nGersonides\u2019 position avoids the epistemological difficulties\napparent in a realist ontology. Inasmuch as the material intellect\nreflects the knowledge inherent in the Agent Intellect, and inasmuch\nas this knowledge is grounded in particulars, it follows that humans\ncan have knowledge of particulars; in this acquisition of knowledge\nlies immortality.\n\nBooks 2 to 4 focus on the relation between God and the world. The\ngeneral problem is whether God\u2019s knowledge is limited to\nnecessary states of affairs or extends to the domain of contingency as\nwell. If the former, then God could not be said to have knowledge of\nhumans, and so divine providence would not be efficacious. But if God\ndoes know contingents\u2014in particular, future contingent\nevents\u2014then it would appear that human freedom is curtailed by\nGod\u2019s prior knowledge of human actions. The problem of the\napparent conflict between divine omniscience and human freedom was\ndiscussed by many medieval philosophers. Gersonides does not follow\nthe majority opinion on this issue: rather than claim that God does\nknow particulars and that this knowledge somehow does not affect human\nfreedom, Gersonides argues that God knows particulars only in a\ncertain sense. In an apparent attempt to mediate between the view of\nAristotle, who said that God does not know particulars, and that of\nMaimonides, who said that he does, Gersonides holds that God knows\nparticulars only insofar as they are ordered. That is, God knows that\ncertain states of affairs are particular, but he does not know in what\ntheir particularity consists. God knows individual persons, for\nexample, only through knowing the species humanity.\n\nWhereas Maimonides claimed that God\u2019s knowledge does not render\nthe objects of his knowledge necessary, Gersonides maintains that\ndivine knowledge precludes contingency. To retain the domain of\ncontingency, he adopts the one option open to him: namely, that God\ndoes not have prior knowledge of future contingents. According to\nGersonides, God knows that certain states of affairs may or may not be\nactualized. But insofar as they are contingent states, he does not\nknow which of the alternatives will be the case. For if God did know\nfuture contingents prior to their actualization, there could be no\ncontingency in the world.\n\nIn book 2, in an attempt to explain how prophecies are possible in a\nsystem which denies the possibility of knowledge of future\ncontingents, Gersonides claims that the prophet does not receive\nknowledge of particular future events; rather his knowledge is of a\ngeneral form, and he must instantiate this knowledge with particular\nfacts. What distinguishes prophets from ordinary persons is that the\nformer are more attuned to receive these universal messages and are in\na position to apply them to particular circumstances.\n\nA further dilemma surrounds the doctrine of divine providence. If God\ndoes not have knowledge of future contingents, how can he be said to\nbestow providence on his creatures? This problem is discussed by\nGersonides both in his commentary on Job and in book 4 of\nMilhamot. In both texts he argues that providence is general\nin nature; it primarily appertains to species and only incidentally to\nparticulars of the species. God, for example, does not know the\nparticular individual Levi ben Gerson and does not bestow particular\nprovidence on him. Rather, inasmuch as Levi ben Gerson is a member of\nthe species humanity and the species philosopher, he is in a position\nto receive the providential care accorded to those groups.\n\nFor Gersonides, the issues of prophecy, omniscience and providence are\ndeveloped against the backdrop of astrological determinism. Like many\nthinkers of the late Middle Ages, Gersonides had to confront two\nopposing sets of traditions: on the one hand, attacks by religious\nauthorities (e.g. Augustine\u2019s attack in City of God;\nMaimonides\u2019 letters) on the grounds that astrology compromised\nhuman free will; on the other hand, the wide scale acceptance of\nastrology from the 12th century on. In the 12th and\n13th centuries, most Jewish and Christian philosophers\nsupported natural astrology, the view that the celestial bodies affect\nsublunar life and existence to some extent at least. That the sun and\nmoon both affect natural cycles and events on earth is unequivocal and\nrepresents a classic paradigm of natural astrology. The calculations\nof natural astrology overlapped those of astronomy, and could be\nutilized for practical purposes such as fixing the calendar. According\nto astrologers, each planet and sign of the zodiac has its own\ncharacter, power and attributes. Inasmuch as the characters of the\nplanets and the signs of the zodiac are opposed to each other, they\nare engaged in a perpetual power struggle. Thus the position of the\nplanets and their interrelation with the signs of the zodiac, regulate\nthe fate of both individuals and nations. Astrological predictions\ncould apply, then to both individuals as well as to the history of\nIsrael and its place in universal history.\n\nAn attack upon astrology as a whole belonged to a much larger\nconflict, that between the roles of reason and faith. Thus, astrology\nshould not be situated within the context of magic or the occult, but\nrather should be construed as a robust contender to science. Based on\na precise scientific astronomy, astrology was a science accepted from\nthe second to the seventeenth centuries. On the scientific level it\nprevailed almost uncontested until and including Newton.\n",
