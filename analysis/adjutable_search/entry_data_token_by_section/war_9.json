    "main_text": "Jus ad Bellum || Proportionality\n3.4 Proportionality\n\nThe central task of the proportionality constraint, recall, is to\nidentify reasons that tell in favour of fighting and those that tell\nagainst it. Much of the latter task is reserved for the discussion of\njus in bello below, since it concerns weighing lives in\nwar.\n\nAmong the goods that help make a war proportionate, we have already\nconsidered those in the just cause and others connected to just peace\nand legitimate authority. Additionally, many also think that\nproportionality can be swayed by reasonable partiality towards\none\u2019s own state and co-citizens. Think back to the political\ninterests that help justify national defence. If we were wholly\nimpartial, then we should choose the course that will best realise\npeople\u2019s political interests overall. So if fighting the\ndefensive war would undermine the political interests of the adversary\nstate\u2019s citizens more than it would undermine our own, then we\nshould refuse to fight. But this is not how we typically think about\nthe permission to resort to war: we are typically entitled to be\nsomewhat partial towards the political interests of our\nco-citizens.\n\nSome propose further constraints on what goods can count towards the\nproportionality of a war. McMahan and McKim (1993) argued that\nbenefits like economic progress cannot make an otherwise\ndisproportionate war proportionate. This is probably true in practice,\nbut perhaps not in principle\u2014that would require a kind of\nlexical priority between lives taken and economic benefits, and\nlexical priorities are notoriously hard to defend. After all, economic\nprogress saves lives. \n\nSome goods lack weight in ad bellum proportionality, not\nbecause they are lexically inferior to other values at stake, but\nbecause they are conditional in particular ways. Soldiers have\nconditional obligations to fulfil their roles, grounded in their\ncontracts, oaths, and their co-citizens\u2019 legitimate\nexpectations. That carrying out an operation fulfils my oath gives me\na reason to perform that operation, which has to be weighed in the\nproportionality calculation (Lazar 2015b). But these reasons cannot\ncontribute to ad bellum proportionality in the same way,\nbecause they are conditional on the war as a whole being fought.\nPolitical leaders cannot plausibly say: \u201cwere it not for all the\noaths that would be fulfilled by fighting, this war would be\ndisproportionate\u201d. This is because fighting counts as fulfilling\nthose oaths only if the political leader decides to take her armed\nforces to war.\n\nAnother reason to differentiate between proportionality ad\nbellum and in bello is that the relevant comparators\nchange for the two kinds of assessment. In a loose sense, we determine\nproportionality by asking whether some option is better than doing\nnothing. The comparator for assessing the war as a whole, then, is\nnot fighting at all, ending the war as a whole. That option\nis not available when considering particular actions within the\nwar\u2014one can only decide whether or not to perform this\nparticular action.\n",
