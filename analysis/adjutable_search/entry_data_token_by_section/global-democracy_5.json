    "main_text": "Models of Global Democracy || Cosmopolitan Democracy\n2.2 Cosmopolitan Democracy\n\n\nCosmopolitan democracy is perhaps the most well-known model of\nglobal democracy. The core idea is to lift statist institutions to the\nglobal level in an on-going effort for democratization. David Held,\nDaniele Archibugi, and Simon Caney have all been prominent advocates.\nNormatively, the model rests on a foundation of autonomy: creating\nglobal political conditions that allow individuals to shape and direct\ntheir own lives. This requires, at the least, a system which protects\nhuman rights and provides democratic mechanisms for citizen input\n(Goodhart 2005). This model is also explicitly cosmopolitan as it is\nsupposed to apply to all individuals across the globe.\n\n\nInstitutionally, cosmopolitan democracy stops short of a fully-fledged\nworld government. As David Held (2003, 478) notes, \u201ca\ncosmopolitan polity does not call for a diminution per se of\nstate power and capacity across the globe. Rather it seeks to entrench\nand develop political institutions at regional and global level as\nnecessary complements to those at the level of the state.\u201d This\noccurs by replicating national democratic institutions at the\ntransnational and global levels, such as the creation of a global\nparliamentary assembly, international courts, and a constitutional\nrule of law (Falk and Strauss 2001; Goodin 2010). These institutions\nprovide a framework to shield human rights and exercise individual\nautonomy by voting in global elections. Moreover, these institutions\nare charged with effectively regulating transnational problems that\nnational institutions cannot tackle alone: climate change, the\ndiffusion of nuclear weapons, and financial markets. This particular\nmodel has given rise to a long-running campaign for the creation of a\nUnited Nations Parliamentary Assembly (see Other Internet Resources\nsection).\n\n\n\nThis model is also not without complication. First, the proposals are\noften thought to be infeasible. By this, critics usually mean that\nthere is a lack of political will to establish organizations such as a\nglobal parliament which would remove some sovereign powers from\nnation-states. Although Held (1995) and Archibugi (2008) often claim\nthat cosmopolitan democracy should be separated into short-term\ntargets and longer-term ideals, it is not always clear which agents\nwould pursue the model nor how current institutional arrangements\ncould be overcome (though see Archibugi and Held (2011) for some\nsuggestions).  Would the IMF, the World Bank, or the International\nAccounting Standards Board, for example, readily give up their control\nover global financial governance? Some critics also charge the\ncosmopolitan model with being undesirable. Although the project is\ndesigned to reduce the global democratic deficit, it does so by\nreproducing liberal democratic institutions beyond the\nstate. Postcolonial arguments have been made against this reliance on\nliberal institutions which represent a specific form of (Western)\ndemocracy that emerged from Europe and the United State (Scholte\n2014).\n",
