    "main_text": "Medial Theories of Sounds || Assessing the Wave Theory\n2.3 Assessing the Wave Theory\n2.3.1 Arguments for the wave theory\n\nMany perceptual properties of sounds are neatly explained by the\npresence of strong correlations with properties of waves, in\nparticular pitch and intensity (i.e., volume).\n\nThe felt quality of high pitch is correlated with high\nfrequencies; low pitch is correlated with low frequencies;\nHigh volumes are correlated with high, low volumes with low,\namplitudes.\nThe directionality of sounds (the fact that they appear to be\n\u201cin a direction\u201d) is related to the fact that the hearer\nis located on a propagation line from the source.\nEven more accomplished is the explanation of particular auditory\neffects, such as the Doppler effect, whereby the speed of a sounding\nobject in motion contributes to a change in the sound\u2019s heard\npitch (so that the whistle of an engine passing by is heard to drop in\npitch as it travels past us).\n\n\nInterestingly enough, the reduction of sounds to waves in a medium is\narguably more successful than the corresponding attempt to reduce\ncolors to properties of electromagnetic waves. The latter attempt is\naffected by some major problems, such as the existence of non-spectral\ncolors like purple, or the fact that some spectral monochromatic\ncolors such as orange are seen as being composed colors.\n2.3.2 Arguments against the wave theory\n\nHowever, for all its merits, the medial identification of sounds with\nsound waves raises some objections and leaves some matters\nwanting.\n\nFor instance, there are metameric sounds (as there are metamers among\ncolors), that is, sounds that feel identical to the ear although the\ncorresponding medial properties are different. There is no one-to-one\npsychophysical correlation between auditory content and sounds as\nwaves (Churchland 2007: 222). Moreover, ultrasounds, above 20.000 Hz\nand infrasounds, below 20 Hz, have the same physical nature as\nsounds\u2014they are mechanical vibrations transmitted by an elastic\nmedium\u2014but they are not audible (as infrared and ultraviolet are\nnot visible in the domain of colors): do they count as sounds? It\nfurther appears that the relationship between sound and sounding\nobject remains underspecified. Do sound waves depend upon sounding\nobjects in the sense in which we usually think sounds (as auditory\nevents) do?\n\nMost importantly, as happened with proximal theories, medial theories\ndo not locate sounds where an untutored conception of auditory\nperception suggests they are. If sounds were sound waves, we would be\nalmost always mistaken in our aural perceptions on important aspects,\nwhich fact, once more, amounts to accounting for auditory perception\nin terms of a massive error theory.\n\nWhat is the nature of sounds under the wave theory? Relevant to our\npurposes, there are two main metaphysical conceptions about waves, in\nboth cases construed as individuals. Either (a)\nwaves are considered to be of the same nature as processes (temporally\nextended entities, with temporal parts), or (b)\nthey are taken as individuals of a peculiar kind. In case (a), it may\nbe argued that they do not move, for arguably processes do not move\n(Dretske 1967), but rather have phases (temporal parts) located at\ndifferent spatial regions. Although we do say that the party moved\nfrom John\u2019s room to Mary\u2019s room, the party was never fully\nin either room. Objects like people (John, Mary, Sue, Lynn), on the\nother hand, were completely in John\u2019s room first, and completely\nin Mary\u2019s room later. Objects and people moved, as movement\noccurs whenever a whole entity is fully first in a place and then in\nanother. The party did not move, but part of it was in John\u2019s\nroom and part of it in Mary\u2019s at different times.\n\nIf waves were processes like parties, one would have to construe sound\nwaves\u2019 \u201cmovement\u201d in terms of the presence of\ndifferent phases of the wave at different spatial locations. However,\none does not hear a sound wave\u2019s phase as being at a particular\nlocation, in particular at any of the locations between the source and\noneself. Sound waves do not appear to be perceptually located where\nsounds are. A wave-process has some starting phases in the object, and\nsome end-phases around the perceiver: but perception locates sounds\nwholly where the object is.\n\nIn\n case (b),\n (sound) waves are different from processes and are peculiar just\nbecause waves move, as individual substances do. But again, if sound\nwaves move, the corresponding sounds are not generally heard as\nmoving. (Contrast this case with seeing a sea wave\u2019s phase at a\nparticular place.) Sound waves propagate in all or most directions\nfrom a sounding object, but the corresponding sounds are not actually\nheard as propagating in any direction: the only moving sounds are the\nsounds emitted by a moving source. It follows that if sounds were\nsound waves in this sense, we would not be hearing them as they\nare.\n\nConsider an analogy with light. In the realm of vision, the closest\nanalogue to sounds are the activities of light sources. We perceive\nthese activities, and we perceive them as located where their sources\nare: the emission of a light bulb out there, the glowing of\ncandlelight over the table, the irradiation of the sun at the horizon;\neach with its own respective color. Do we perceive light itself, as\nopposed to the events of light emission at light sources? Clearly,\nlight travels from the source to our eye\u2014if it didn\u2019t, we\nwould not perceive the source. But what we perceive is the emission\nevent, and not the light. An irrelevant element of disanalogy is\nrelated to the temporal unfolding of sounds and light events\nrespectively. Typically in the environment light is emitted\ncontinuously, whereas sounds occur episodically and have short lives.\nIf most light sources were intermittent as in piezoelectric lighters,\nor if most objects were buzzing all the time, this element of\ndisanalogy would be less salient (Pasnau 2007).\n\nIn some conditions it looks as if we perceive light rays, e.g., in a\ndusty room. But what is actually perceived is a set of particles of\nwater or of dust that intercept light. In order for a light ray to be\nvisible, it would have to send information to our eye without the\nmediation of interposed matter. Coming back to sounds, the argument\nbased on the constraint of fidelity to the content of auditory\nperception is thus, in a compact form: in order for sound waves to be\naudible, they would have to transmit audible information that reaches\nour ears. They don\u2019t. So we do not hear them. But we do hear\nsounds. Hence sounds are not (medial) sound waves.\n2.3.3 Arguments for or against the wave theory reassessed\n\nSome other remarks against the identification of sounds with sound\nwaves in the medium between the object and the perceiver apply\nindependently of the metaphysical construal of sound waves as\nprocesses or sui generis individuals.\n\nConsider first the fact that sounds are sometimes loud and sometimes\nsoft; as we have seen, in the wave theory this feature is correlated\nwith amplitude of the sound waves. However, the location of the sound\nplays a role in establishing the correlation. A loud sound, which is\nheard as being far from us, is different from a soft sound, which is\nheard as being close to us. The spectra of the two sounds are\ndifferent. If you want a vivid example, consider what happens if you\namplify the sound of a person who is speaking low. You do not have the\nimpression of a person who speaks loud. You have, on the other hand,\nthe impression of having come very close to a low-speaking giant.\n\nIn some conditions, however, it can be difficult for us to tell a loud\nsound in the distance from a soft sound nearby, because in the part of\nspace closer to our ears the sound waves that reach us and correspond\nto the two sounds can have the same amplitude. (This only holds for an\nideal case of a long lasting sine wave with no sharp attack. This type\nof sound is practically distance-proof because having a single\ncomponent, the only possible variation is in amplitude, and no other\nspectral differences arise.)\n\nIndeed, the fact that the two sine waves have the same amplitude when\nthey are close to the ear accounts for the indistinguishability of the\ntwo sounds. Nevertheless, the two sounds, even if indistinguishable,\nare distinct, whereas the two sound waves are not. A way to put the\ndifficulty is as follows: a loud sinusoid heard at a distance is still\na loud sinusoid; but the corresponding sound waves decrease in\namplitude. As we have seen discussing proximal theories, we can make\nperfect sense of the notion of distal volume of sounds, even in the\ncase in which we cannot distinguish a loud distant sound from a soft\nsound in the vicinity. Something (decrease in amplitude) happens to\nsound waves which does not happen to sounds (the distal volume does\nnot change). Hence it can be argued that on this account too sounds\nare distinct from sound waves.\n\nAs a matter of fact, one may want to distinguish two possible lines of\nargument here:\n\nA phenomenological argument, claiming that sometimes we hear a\nconstant sound (constant in intensity, for instance), even though the\nsource is moving away from us. Here different sound waves can\ncorrespond to one and the same sound.\nA metaphysical argument, holding that sometimes the sound waves\ncorresponding to two sounds are the same while the sounds are clearly\ndifferent: a loud sound in the distance, or a faint sound close to us.\nHere the very same sound waves can correspond to distinct sounds. The\nlatter argument is not lethal, but is a useful reminder that there is\nno fully developed theory of sounds as medial sound waves as yet.\nShould the sound be identified with the sound waves when they reach\nthe ears, or with the whole train of sound waves from the source to\nour ears, or with the sphere filled with sound waves and centered on\nthe source?\n\n\nThe thesis that sounds are sound waves is also often motivated by the\nargument from vacuums. Surely, it is argued, sounds cannot exist in a\nvacuum. As Hylas says in Berkeley\u2019s Three Dialogues Between\nHylas and Philonous, \n\n\na bell struck in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, sends forth no\nsound. The air therefore must be thought the subject of sound. (1713\n[1975: 171\u2013172]) \n\n\nBut is the claim that there are no sounds in vacuums really obvious?\nOn pain of question begging, it cannot be made to follow from any\nparticular metaphysics of sounds. In order to assess it on its own\nmerits, consider once more the analogy between, on the one hand,\nsounds and air, and, on the other hand, emission events at light\nsources and light. Air is the medium of auditory perception, and light\nis the medium of visual perception. The reasoning now is that just as\nthings can sensibly be taken to have colors in the dark, they can\nsensibly be taken to produce sounds in a vacuum.\n\nIn the above arguments an important role is played by the following\nrequirement: A theory of sounds should be true to the\nphenomenological content of auditory perception. It seems quite\nreasonable to require that as sounds are the objects of hearing,\nwhatever they are should be somewhat revealed in hearing. In point of\nfact, there are two ways in which the fidelity to auditory content\nrequirement can enter the arguments. In a strong version\n(O\u2019Callaghan 2009) it may be held that no theory of sounds\n\u201cshould make the fact of location perception a wholesale\nillusion\u201d (2009: 29); hence, as sounds are represented as\nlocated, it would follow that they are correctly so represented. It\nmay be argued that this principle is too strong because it is\nunjustifiably specific. Why should location, among all possible\nfeatures of sounds, be protected against the possibility of systematic\nillusion?\n\nIn another, weaker version (Casati & Dokic 1994) it is the\nrepresentational power of auditory content that is appealed to.\nAuditory experience has the power to represent sounds, and it has the\npower to represent movement (as when one hears the sound of a moving\ntrain\u2019s whistle). It is then natural to assume that auditory\nexperience would be able to represent sounds as moving, if sounds were\nindeed moving entities by their nature. But such is not the case;\nhence auditory experience correctly represents them as firmly located.\nThis construal of the requirement is compatible with the existence of\nsystematic, though possibly selective, illusion.\n\nThe requirement of fidelity to auditory content may be challenged on a\nnumber of grounds. First, it may be challenged by opposing its\nrationale. Auditory content may well be massively illusory, and this\ncould be just the price to pay for any realist account of sounds.\n\nPossibly there is here an analogue to the case of colors, in which\nthere is room for selective illusion and for the choice between\nrealism about location, say, and realism about hue. Most arguments for\nthe subjectivity of colors start from the existence of strong\ncorrelations between phenomenal hue structures (such as the relation\nof complementarity between colors, e.g., red and green, which is\nmanifest in phenomena such as afterimages or color-blindness) and\nneural structures (such as bipolar cells). These arguments then stress\nthe absence of physical correlates for hue structure (nothing in the\nwavelengths corresponding to red and green hues can make one predict\nthe subjective complementarity between red and green). They finally\nconclude that colors are mind-dependent. However, the arguments only\nestablish the mind-dependence of hue structures, not of colors per se.\nThe location of colors as \u201coutside the brain\u201d can still be\ntaken for granted. Brought back to sounds, this form of selective\nrealism would allow for subjective tonal qualities and for an external\n(non proximal) location of sounds.\n\nSecond, the requirement of fidelity to auditory content may be\nchallenged by questioning the phenomenological claim that motivates\nit. The move would consist in suggesting that sounds do not have the\nstrong spatial property of locatedness, but the weaker property of\ndirectionality. The distinction between two senses of\n\u201clocatedness\u201d in relation to sounds can be traced back to\nMalpas (1965), based on ordinary language arguments, and is echoed in\nUrmson (1968) and Hacker (1987: 102 ff.); cf. O\u2019Shaughnessy\n(1957). Locatedness in the strong sense specifies an address for the\nsound, e.g., by specifying both directionality and distance from the\nhearer (thus including egocentrical directionality as a component), or\nby locating sounds in allocentric space (e.g., a siren from the boat\nat Pier 3). According to a weaker sense of \u201clocatedness\u201d,\nsounds would only be perceived as \u201ccoming from\u201d a certain\ndirection, without any information about the distance they travel. Now\nsurely this is not the general case. Although in some cases (e.g., the\ndecrease in amplitude of a sine wave) it may be difficult or\nimpossible to tell, say, whether what we hear is a soft sound nearby\nor a loud sound far away, in most cases the distinction is perfectly\navailable to the subject, as we noticed earlier when we introduced the\nnotion of distal volume: someone screaming in a distance is never\nconfused with someone speaking low near you ear. Indeed the issue of\nthe locatedness of sounds is the subject matter of specialized\nbranches of cognitive science (Blauert 1974; Bregman 1990; Schnupp,\nNelken, & King 2011; Grimshaw & Garner 2015).\n\nIncidentally, claiming that sounds are heard in a direction rather\nthan at a location mixes up two ways of accounting for auditory\nexperience: phenomenology on the one hand and commonsense reflections\non the directional transmission of auditory information on the other\nhand. The commonsense picture may have been made a bit too\nsophisticated by exposure to some physical accounts of sounds.\n\nFinally, the requirement of fidelity to auditory content may also be\nchallenged by proposing a different phenomenology. For example,\nKalderon (2017) argues that sound is an event that is identical to the\npropagation in every direction of a pattered disturbance by means of a\nmedium, such as air or water (2017: 105). He claims, indeed, that\nauditory phenomenology is essentially emanative phenomenology.\nAccording to emanative phenomenology, we hear sound as an\never-expanding sphere which is the medium disturbance propagating in\nevery direction from its source. Sound is like \n\n\nan expanding ripple caused by a drop in an otherwise calm body of\nwater, except that the sound event occurs in three dimensions, not\ntwo, and so takes the form of a sphere rather than a circle. (2017:.\n106) \n\n\nWhen facing the challenge of what we hear when we say we hear birds in\nthe garden outside or people in the corridor outside our\noffice\u2014which are cases in which it is clear that auditory\nphenomenology is distally locating sounds and not making us hearing\nsounds as pervading the surrounding medium\u2014Kalderon replies by\nsaying that what we hear in these cases as distally located are sound\nsources, rather than sounds (2017: 115). Nevertheless, this reply\nraises the question of how we make the distinction between hearing\nsound as located and sound sources as located. Is there a way to\ndistinguish their different location phenomenologically? Another\nquestion which might challenge the medial view based on emanative\nphenomenology is what are exactly the properties of sound sources\nwhich are audible and which provide us with spatial information on\ntheir location.\n2.3.4 Defending the wave theory: giving up fidelity to auditory content\n\nWave theorists typically give up the requirement that an account of\nsound be faithful to auditory content (although they would not\ntypically acknowledge this; as Pasnau 1999 has remarked, the very same\ntextbook on sounds may simultaneously endorse a medial, a proximal and\na distal theory). However, wave theorists may also try to reconcile\nauditory content with the wave conception. Sorensen (2008) proposes\nfor instance that it is not a purely auditory phenomenon that we do\nsometimes identify and localize objects and events at their\ncenter, whenever a center is available. For instance\nearthquakes are localized (in the epistemic sense) at their\nhypocenter, although it is admitted that they are not located\nat their hypocenter. An earthquake is everywhere it can be felt or\nmeasured. Analogously, according to the wave theorist sounds are waves\nin a medium, but they are located at their center (at their origin).\nThe wave conception considers as relatively benign the error of\nlocating a sound (i.e., a sound wave) at its center/origin.\n\nAn important dialectical limitation of Sorensen\u2019s suggestion is\nthat it does not provide us with an independent argument in favor of\nthe Wave Theory. The identification of sounds with sound waves is of\ncourse compatible with the fact that we locate sounds at a point (the\nsounding object\u2019s location) which happens to be the center of\nexpanding sound waves. However, the analogy with the localization of\nearthquakes breaks down at a crucial point. Of course, we can usefully\nidentify a certain region as the center of a particular\nearthquake. (In general, earthquakes can be localized at their\nhypocenter only when we have at least a rough representation of their\nfull extension in space.) By contrast, as Sorensen admits, the\nauditory system does not identify the sounding object\u2019s location\nas the center of expanding sound waves. Indeed, it does not\nidentify this location as the center of anything. (Compare the way the\nvisual system identifies the landing area of a stone thrown in water\nas the center of a series of concentric, expanding waves. None of the\nsort is available to the auditory system.) Now many entities other\nthan sound waves are at the object\u2019s location when we hear a\nsound, including events (monadic or relational, as we shall see\nbelow). Thus, facts about the apparent location of sounds do not\njustify the Wave Theory better than the Event Theory; quite the\ncontrary, given our other independent considerations against the\nformer approach.\n2.3.5 Source medium and environment medium\n\nSeveral among the previous remarks jointly point to the necessity of\nbetter accounting for the distinction between events in the sounding\nthing and events in the surrounding medium. As for sounds, this\ndistinction is consequent upon the distinction between two kinds of\nmedium: the source medium (that is, the stuff the thing is composed\nof) and the medium proper or environment medium, surrounding the\nsounding thing, the one in which the hearer could be immersed as well.\nLet us take them in turn. First, a thing is a sounding entity only\ninsofar the stuff or the stuffs the thing is composed of is or are\nvibrating. For a simple example, there are no properties of a tuning\nfork which account for its sounding, which are not properties of the\nstuff(s) the fork consists of (including shape). A more complex\nexample is the case of the flute, in which the \u201csounding\nobject\u201d is air inside the flute. In both cases a portion of\nmatter\u2014the source medium\u2014is vibrating.\n\nBut, second, do we ever happen to hear events in the medium? We\nactually do, but in a somewhat indirect way. Consider the visual\nrealm. In some cases both a thing and (a part of) a medium between us\nand the thing are seen. This happens when we look at things through\nirregularly warmed air, or through moving water. In these cases, we\nsee both the thing and the medium, the thing in an unclear way, and\nthe medium as that which makes the thing appear in an unclear way.\n\nBut these cases are not the norm. Perceptual media are in the norm\ncognitively transparent: they are imperceptible insofar as they\ntransmit without significant alteration information about some\nrelevant properties of the thing perceived through them. Media become\nperceivable when this transmitting function is impaired by some event\nor disturbance occurring in them. Auditorily, this occurs in the case\nof the Doppler effect. The vibration of the air carries information\nboth about the sounding object and about the effect its speed has on\nthe medium.\n\nThe affectedness of the medium is a feature which is mostly evident,\nand almost pervasive in the case of sounds, because of the relatively\nsimilar size of the phenomena involved at the source and in the medium\nproper. Vibrations in the sounding objects are macroscopic phenomena,\nof a size which is fairly comparable to the size of the sounding\nobject itself. Therefore the interaction of these vibrations with the\nsurrounding medium can easily be a source of misperception, for their\nimpact on the medium brings about processes which are of the same\norder of magnitude of the object involved.\n",
