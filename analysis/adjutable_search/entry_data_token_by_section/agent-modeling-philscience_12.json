    "main_text": "Common Modeling Frameworks || Bandit models\n3.2 Bandit models\n\nIn the previous section we saw how epistemic landscape models have\nbeen used to represent inquiries involving mutually compatible\nresearch projects (as in Weisberg and Muldoon\u2019s model) as well\nas inquiries involving rival hypotheses (as in Grim and Singer\u2019s\nmodel). Another framework used to study the latter scenario is based\non \u201cbandit problems\u201d.\n\nThe name of bandit models comes from the term \u201cone-armed\nbandit\u201d\u2014a colloquial name for a slot machine. Multi-armed\nbandit problems, introduced in statistics (Robbins 1952; Berry &\nFristedt 1985) and studied in economics (Bala & Goyal 1998; Bolton\n& Harris 1999), are decision-making problems that concern the\nfollowing kind of scenario: suppose a gambler is about to play several\nslot machines. Each machine gives a random payoff according to a\nprobability distribution unknown to the gambler. To determine which\nmachine will give a higher reward in the long run, the gambler has to\nexperiment by pulling arms of the machines. This will allow her to\nlearn from the obtained results. But which strategy should she use?\nFor instance, should she alternate between the machines for the first\ncouple of pulls, and then play only the machine that has given the\nhighest reward during the initial test run? Or should she rather have\na lengthy test phase before deciding which machine is better? While in\nthe first case she might start exploiting her current\nknowledge before she has sufficiently explored, in the second\ncase she might explore for too long. In this way the gambler faces a\ntrade-off between exploitation (playing the machine that has so far\ngiven the best payoff) and exploration (continued testing of different\nmachines). The challenge is thus to come up with the strategy that\nprovides an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation, so\nas to maximize one\u2019s total winnings.\n\nAs we have seen above (see\n Section 2.2),\n the exploration/exploitation trade-off may also occur in the context\nof scientific research. Whether scientists are attempting to determine\nif a novel treatment for a disease is superior to an existing one, or\nselecting between two novel methods of evidence gathering with varying\nsuccess rates, they may encounter the exploration/exploitation\ntrade-off. In other words, they may have to decide when to cease\nexploring alternatives and begin exploiting the one that appears most\nsuitable for the task.\n\nABMs based on bandit problems were first introduced to philosophy of\nscience by Zollman (2007, 2010). A bandit ABM usually looks as\nfollows. In analogy to slot machines, each scientific theory (or\nhypothesis, or method) is represented as having a designated\nprobability of success. Scientists are typically modeled as\n\u201cmyopic\u201d agents in the sense that they always pursue a\ntheory they believe to give a higher payoff. They gather evidence for\na theory by making a random draw from a probability distribution.\nSubsequently, they update their beliefs in a Bayesian way, on the\nbasis of results of their own research (the gathered evidence) as well\nas results of neighboring scientists in their social network (such as\nthose in\n Figure 1).\n Scientists are thus not modeled as passive observers of evidence for\nall the available theories, but rather as agents who actively\ndetermine the type of evidence they gather by choosing which theory to\npursue. The inquiry of the community is considered successful if, for\nexample, scientists reach a consensus on the better of the two\ntheories.\n\nBandit models of this kind build on the analytical framework developed\nby economists (Bala & Goyal 1998) who examined the relationship\nbetween different communication networks in infinite populations and\nthe process of social learning. Applied to the context of science,\nthis variation of bandit problems concerns the puzzle mentioned above\nin\n Section 2.2:\n assuming a scientific community is trying to determine which of the\ntwo available hypotheses offers a better treatment for a given\ndisease, could the structure of the information flow among the\nscientists impact their chances of converging on the better\nhypothesis? By applying Bala and Goyal\u2019s framework to the\ncontext of science and scenarios involving finite populations, Zollman\ninitiated the field of network epistemology (see Zollman 2013), which\nstudies the impact of social networks on the process of knowledge\nacquisition.\n\nBeside the aim of examining network effects on the formation of\nscientific consensus, bandit models of scientific interaction have\nbeen applied to a number of other topics, such as the impact of\npreferential attachment on social learning (Alexander 2013), bias and\ndeception in science (Holman & Bruner 2015, 2017; Weatherall,\nO\u2019Connor, & Bruner 2020), optimal forms of collaboration\n(Zollman 2017), factors leading to scientific polarization\n(O\u2019Connor & Weatherall 2018; Weatherall & O\u2019Connor\n2021b), effects of conformity (Weatherall & O\u2019Connor 2021a),\neffects of demographic diversity (Fazelpour & Steel 2022),\nregulations of dual-use research (Wagner & Herington 2021), social\nlearning in which a dominant group ignores or devalues testimony from\na marginalized group (Wu 2023), or disagreements on the diagnosticity\nof evidence for a certain hypothesis (Michelini & Osorio et al.\nforthcoming).\n",
