    "main_text": "Circular Phenomena in Set Theory\n1. Circular Phenomena in Set Theory\n\n It is difficult to say in a general way what makes a definition\ncircular.  In this entry we are concerned exclusively with\nmathematical definitions of various sorts.  Consider the equation\nx = \u00bdx + 1.  Is this a circular\ndefinition of the number 2?  In a sense, it is just that: a\nnumber has been defined in terms of itself.  But there is nothing\nproblematic about this equation, and so one may wonder why this is in\nthe same class of equations as x = x + 1, or\nx = x.  In the set theoretic setting, we often\nemploy circular definitions and characterizations of sets and classes.\nFor example, the collection HF of hereditarily\nfinite sets may be characterized by \n\n\n (1) HF is the set of all x such that x is\na finite subset of HF.\n\n\n\n With a bit of work, it can be shown that (1) defines a unique set in\nstandard set theory ZFC.  (1) is more of a\ncharacterization than a textbook definition, however.  In\nother words, if one were presented with (1) as a putative\ndefinition, then the first step in understanding it\n would be to \u201cstraighten out\u201d the circularity by providing\na different definition D of a set, then to check that every\nset satisfying D satisfies the property defining HF,\nand vice-versa.\n\n It is easier to think about circular objects than circular\ndefinitions.  Even so, it will be useful in reading this\nentry to keep circular definitions in mind.  The most conspicuous form\nof object circularity would be a set having itself as an element; even\nworse would be a set x such that x = {x}.\nFor those with a background in standard set theory, such sets are\nruled out by the axioms in the first place, and in the second it is\nnot clear why one would want to change the axioms in order to admit\nthem.  And if one does take the drastic step of altering the axioms of\na well-established theory, what changes?  This entry is an extended\ndiscussion of this matter, and related ones.\n\n",
