    "main_text": "Premise III: The Anomalism Principle || The Holism/Indeterminacy Arguments\n4.1 The Holism/Indeterminacy Arguments\n\nDavidson\u2019s explicit considerations in favor of mental anomalism\nappeal to factors about the interpretation of action (linguistic as\nwell as non-linguistic) and the ascription of mental states and events\nto persons. Several distinguishable features are noted\u2014holism\nwith respect to particular ascriptions, indeterminacy with respect to\nsystematic interpretative frameworks, and the responsiveness of mental\nascription to an ideal of rationality. According to holism, particular\nmental states can be cited in explanation of behavior only in the\ncontext of other mental states, which in turn depend upon others.\nDavidson claims that this dependency and holistic interrelatedness is\n\u201cwithout limit\u201d (Davidson 1970, 217). This echoes a\nrelated point he makes about the impossibility of definitional\nreduction of mental states in purely behavioristic terms, because of\nthe ineliminable need for mental caveats (e.g., that the person\nunderstands, or notices or cares\u2026.) qualifying any attempt to\nstate non-mental conditions for mental states.\n\nDavidson presents these claims about definitional reduction as facts\nwhich \u201cprovide at best hints of why we should not expect\nnomological connections between the mental the physical\u201d\n(Davidson 1970, 217). If definitional reduction of this kind were in\nfact impossible, it would rule out the possibility of a subclass of\nstrict psychophysical laws\u2014those relating mental states with\nnon-intentionally described behavior\u2014but the basis for this\nimpossibility would not have been explained. In fact, however, without\nknowing what that basis is supposed to be, we have no reason to accept\nDavidson\u2019s claim that definitional reduction is indeed\nimpossible. What prevents us from articulating all the required\ncaveats? Without a rationale in hand, nothing prevents a reductionist\nfrom simply offering us detailed definitions and challenging us to\ncome up with counterexamples. Something both principled and convincing\nis clearly needed. Davidson\u2019s concerns about definitional\nreduction are \u2018hints\u2019 concerning nomological reduction\nonly in the sense that they draw out our intuitions about something\nstanding in the way of formulating such laws. What that obstacle is\nneeds clear formulation.\n\nAt times, Davidson appeared to flirt with the idea that the missing\nlink was provided by the thesis of the indeterminacy of translation,\ndeveloped by W.V Quine (1960) and endorsed by Davidson (1970, 222;\n1979). This thesis claims that there are empirically adequate but\nnon-equivalent complete frameworks for assigning linguistic meanings\nand mental states to a person on the basis of his behavior, and that\nthere is no fact of the matter that determines that one but not other\nsuch frameworks is correct. In particular, there are no physical\nfacts, inside a person\u2019s body or head or outside in the external\nworld, that could settle whether a person\u2019s words refer to some\ndeterminate range of objects rather than some other range, or whether\none rather than another systematically interdependent set of mental\nstates, with distinct distributions of truth values, is true of that\nperson (see Davidson 1979). If the indeterminacy thesis is true, then\non the face of it there would be some rationale for rejecting the\npossibility of psychophysical laws. For if all physical facts are\nconsistent with different psychological/semantic assignments, then it\nseems that knowing all the physical facts could not tell us whether\nsome mental states were true of some person, or some meaning true of\nher words\u2014neither could be exceptionlessly predicted or\nexplained, just as mental anomalism maintains.\n\nThere are two problems with this, however. First, this would do\nnothing to rule out certain psychophysical laws, such as those of the\nform\n\u2018M1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0P1\u2019.\nAnd so it couldn\u2019t ground the completely general thesis\nof mental anomalism. But more importantly, Davidson himself holds that\nthe least controversial versions of indeterminacy, having to do with\ndiverging reference schemes, amount to mere notational\nvariance\u2014as he puts it, meaning is what is invariant between\nempirically adequate translation schemes (Davidson 1977, 225; 1999a,\n81). And given that such schemes are generated through a purely\nmechanical permutation function (Davidson 1979, 229\u201330) it is a\nrelatively simple technical trick to take these different schemes into\naccount when formulating psychophysical laws. The laws, for instance,\ncould be formulated with disjunctive predicates\n(\u2018P1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0(M1\u00a0\u2228\u00a0M2\u00a0\u2228\u00a0M3\u2019).\nOr, if such predicates are considered problematic, the laws could be\nof the form\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M*\u2019,\nwhere \u2018M*\u2019 picks out the invariant element\nbetween the empirically equivalent theories. So it is not at all clear\nthat indeterminacy in and of itself is capable of supporting an\nacross-the-board rejection of strict psychological or psychophysical\nlaws. And Davidson ultimately acknowledges this, in stating that\nanomalism would hold even if indeterminacy didn\u2019t (Davidson\n1970, 222).\n",
