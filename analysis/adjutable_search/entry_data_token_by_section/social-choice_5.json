    "main_text": "Three formal arguments for majority rule || A procedural argument for majority rule\n2.2 A procedural argument for majority rule\n\nThe first involves imposing some \u2018procedural\u2019 requirements\non the relationship between individual votes and social decisions and\nshowing that majority rule is the only aggregation rule satisfying\nthem. May (1952) introduced four such requirements:\n\n\nUniversal domain: The domain of admissible inputs of the\naggregation rule consists of all logically possible profiles of votes\n\\(\\langle v_1, v_2 , \\ldots ,v_n\\rangle\\), where each \\(v_i \\in\n\\{-1,1\\}\\).\n\nAnonymity: For any admissible profiles \\(\\langle v_1, v_2 ,\n\\ldots ,v_n\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle w_1, w_2 , \\ldots ,w_n\\rangle\\)\nthat are permutations of each other (i.e., one can be obtained from\nthe other by reordering the entries), the social decision is the same,\ni.e., \\(f(v_1, v_2 , \\ldots ,v_n) = f(w_1, w_2 , \\ldots ,w_n)\\).\n\nNeutrality: For any admissible profile \\(\\langle v_1, v_2 ,\n\\ldots ,v_n\\rangle\\), if the votes for the two alternatives are\nreversed, the social decision is reversed too, i.e., \\(f(-v_1, -v_2 ,\n\\ldots ,-v_n) = -f(v_1, v_2 , \\ldots ,v_n)\\).\n\nPositive responsiveness: For any admissible profile \\(\\langle\nv_1, v_2 , \\ldots ,v_n\\rangle\\), if some voters change their votes in\nfavour of one alternative (say the first) and all other votes remain\nthe same, the social decision does not change in the opposite\ndirection; if the social decision was a tie prior to the change, the\ntie is broken in the direction of the change, i.e., if [\\(w_i \\gt\nv_i\\) for some \\(i\\) and \\(w_j = v_j\\) for all other \\(j\\)] and\n\\(f(v_1, v_2 , \\ldots ,v_n) = 0\\) or 1, then \\(f(w_1, w_2 , \\ldots\n,w_n) = 1\\).\n\n\nUniversal domain requires the aggregation rule to cope with any level\nof \u2018pluralism\u2019 in its inputs; anonymity requires it to\ntreat all voters equally; neutrality requires it to treat all\nalternatives equally; and positive responsiveness requires the social\ndecision to be a positive function of the way people vote. May proved\nthe following:\n\n\nTheorem (May 1952): An aggregation rule satisfies universal\ndomain, anonymity, neutrality, and positive responsiveness if and only\nif it is majority rule.\n\n\nApart from providing an argument for majority rule based on four\nplausible procedural desiderata, the theorem helps us characterize\nother aggregation rules in terms of which desiderata they violate.\nDictatorships and weighted majority rules with unequal individual\nweights violate anonymity. Asymmetrical supermajority rules (under\nwhich a supermajority of the votes, such as two thirds or three\nquarters, is required for a decision in favour of one of the\nalternatives, while the other alternative is the default choice)\nviolate neutrality. This may sometimes be justifiable, for instance\nwhen there is a presumption in favour of one alternative, such as a\npresumption of innocence in a jury decision. Symmetrical supermajority\nrules (under which neither alternative is chosen unless it is\nsupported by a sufficiently large supermajority) violate positive\nresponsiveness. A more far-fetched example of an aggregation rule\nviolating positive responsiveness is the inverse majority rule (here\nthe alternative rejected by a majority wins).\n\nMay\u2019s theorem has been generalized in a variety of ways,\nincluding to the mathematically interesting but unrealistic case of\ninfinite sets of voters (Fey 2004) and to choices between multiple\noptions (e.g., Cantillon and Rangel 2002, offering a May-style\ncharacterization of\u00a0pairwise majority voting; and Goodin and List\n2006, offering a May-style characterization of plurality rule).\n",
