Do\nwe have the same duties to non-compatriots as we have to compatriots\nor is there some principled way in which these two sets of duties\nought to differ?\n\nNationalists argue that we belong to national communities and any\naccount of our global responsibilities that ignores this omits an\nimportant aspect of how we relate \u2013 and ought to relate \u2013\nto one another. They argue that nations can provide a valuable\ngrounding for social attachment, identity and meaning in life, and can\nground special obligations to strengthen national life and assist\nco-nationals (Miller 1995; Tamir 1993; Lenard 2012). Others defend the\nvalue of nationalism on instrumental grounds; there is nothing\ninherently special about our co-national relationships but state\nboundaries are useful in assigning important duties to particular\nagents (Goodin 1998). In a world of great unmet need, paying special\nattention to one\u2019s co-nationals can be justified (Goodin 1998;\nLenard\n 2012).[2]\n\nIn the words of Diogenes, widely credited as the first person to\npropound cosmopolitan views, cosmopolitans see themselves as\n\u201ccitizens of the world\u201d. Contemporary cosmopolitans\ntypically hold that every human being has standing as an ultimate unit\nof moral concern and is entitled to equal consideration of her\ninterests no matter what other affiliations, especially national\naffiliations, she might have. Drawing on the idea that we all have\nequal moral worth, cosmopolitans seek to broaden our moral horizons so\nthat we do not forget about the responsibilities we have to others\nbeyond state borders, even when we have local responsibilities as\nwell.\n\nProminent cosmopolitans frequently offer accounts that feature\ndifferent elements. Martha Nussbaum emphasizes that, as human beings,\nwe belong to a global community of human persons (Nussbaum 1996).\nNussbaum argues that while love for one\u2019s country might have a\nlegitimate place in people\u2019s conceptions of a good life, we\nshould not overlook the many other relationships we are in which\nconnect us to others in the world. We need to draw the global\ncommunity in closer to the local one, and, more generally, aim to see\nourselves as members of overlapping communities which also have\nimportant claims on us.\n\nBy contrast, Thomas Pogge focuses on the implications of\ncosmopolitanism for the global institutional order. We need to ensure\nthat global institutional structures give equal consideration to\neveryone\u2019s interests. He says, \u201cInsofar as human agents\nare involved in the design or administration of global rules,\npractices, or organizations, they ought to disregard their private and\nlocal, including national, commitments and loyalties to give equal\nconsideration to the needs and interests of every human being on this\nplanet\u201d (Pogge 2013, 298). This equal-consideration-of-interests\nrequirement only applies to such contexts. While such impartiality\nnorms are perfectly familiar within the state, for instance, when\njudges operate in law courts, we have yet to realize the requirement\nat the global level.\n\nIt is often assumed that cosmopolitanism must necessarily be in\ntension with more local attachments to friends, family or compatriots.\nSome cosmopolitans believe such conflict is inevitable, unproblematic\nand a necessary part of understanding what cosmopolitanism entails\n(Ypi 2013a). Others argue for different ways in which the apparent\ntensions could be resolved (Pogge 2013; Tan 2004; Appiah 2007; Cabrera\n2020). As we see above, Pogge emphasizes the clear separation of\nspheres in which equal consideration of people\u2019s interests\napplies. Kok-Chor Tan offers a similar argument. His strategy is to\nshow that cosmopolitan principles should govern global institutional\nstructures that ensure people are treated as equals in their\nentitlements (Tan 2004). When this is the case there can be a\nlegitimate role for patriotism that operates within such constraints.\nPartiality to co-nationals need not conflict with cosmopolitan\nobligations. Another notable strategy is to argue that we cannot\nachieve justice at a national level unless we attend to justice at a\nglobal level. On this view, we have at least instrumental reasons to\ncare about global justice, even if we care deeply about social justice\nin our nation (Banai; Ronzoni and Schemmel 2011; Ronzoni 2013).\n\nThere is an important debate among egalitarian theorists about whether\nour concern with equality should be confined to members of the same\nstate or whether it should extend to all globally. Some theorists\nargue that careful consideration of notions such as reciprocity,\ncoercion, or fair terms of co-operation mandate that we give special\nweighting to the interests of compatriots (Blake 2013). Others, by\ncontrast, argue that these concerns, when properly understood, point\nin the direction of equally strong duties to non-compatriots. One form\nof the argument that we have special duties to compatriots that are\nnot shared with non-compatriots, draws on the coercive legal structure\nthat applies within states and claims that such coercive structures do\nnot apply outside of them (R. Miller 1998; Blake 2001). Another highly\ninfluential version claims that there is a difference in the authority\nto enforce justice within and outside the state (Nagel 2005). There\nare many important challenges to such positions. One important line of\nargument maintains that coercion is indeed relevant in triggering\nduties of egalitarian justice, but since this is rampant at the global\nlevel it activates global not just national egalitarian duties (Cohen\nand Sabel 2006; Abizadeh 2007; Valentini 2012). So, the same\ningredients Nagel identifies as crucial in generating state authority\nexist at the global level as well (Cohen and Sabel 2006). Nicole\nHassoun argues that there are many coercive international institutions\nand that, to be legitimate, these institutions must ensure that\neveryone they subject to coercive rules can secure what they need to\nconsent or object to these rules. This requires adequate food, water,\nshelter, education, healthcare and the social and emotional support\nthey require for sufficient autonomy (Hassoun 2012). Laura Valentini\nsuggests coercion requires freedom as independence (non-domination)\nbut this does not require egalitarianism in the global sphere. Rather,\na just global order would be inclusive, not oppressive (Tan 2013, 25).\nOthers provide novel ways of defending cosmopolitan egalitarian\ntheories or combining them with statist commitments. Pablo Gilabert\narticulates a contractualist theory of egalitarian justice that\ngenerates positive obligations to eradicate severe poverty globally\neven without robust international institutions or cosmopolitan\nsolidarity (2012). Similarly, Lea Ypi defends a statist\ncosmopolitanism that stresses the importance of political obligations\nto support cosmopolitan ends. She suggests a significant degree of\nequality is important for helping everyone secure a basic minimum and\ncultural resources, a sense of justice, and education can help promote\nthis equality (Ypi 2012; on education and global justice, in\nparticular, see Culp 2020a). Ypi sees fostering the commitment to\ncosmopolitan ideals as a political, as well as moral, task (Ypi\n2013a).\n\nOnce again, these are vast topics and more treatment can be found\nelsewhere in this encyclopedia, such as the entry on\n international distributive justice.\n For comprehensive treatment of nationalism and cosmopolitanism see\nthe entries on\n nationalism\n and\n cosmopolitanism,\n respectively.\n",
