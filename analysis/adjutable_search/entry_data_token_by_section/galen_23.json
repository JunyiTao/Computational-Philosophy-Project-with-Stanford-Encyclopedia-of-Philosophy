    "main_text": "Ethics || Rational Errors and the Good\n8.4 Rational Errors and the Good\nGalen\u2019s main extant ethical work, Aff. Pecc. Dig., explicitly addresses itself to the correction of both affections (path\u0113) and errors (hamart\u0113mata)\u2014that is to say, to the shortcomings of both the non-rational and the rational part of the soul. Galen is clear that the domain of ethics covers the identification and correction of both; yet in the latter area\u2014that of ethical errors of reason\u2014his discussion is much less clear. He prefers to focus on intellectual error and inadequate intellectual training more broadly, in a way which seems more relevant to the discovery of scientific than to that of ethical truth. Relatedly, it is difficult to find in Galen a clear answer to the question of the goal of life, or ultimate good for human beings. What seems clear is that although he regards freedom from distress\u2014a condition which may seem very similar to Epicurean \u201cuntroubledness\u201d (ataraxia) or Stoic \u201cunaffectedness\u201d (apatheia)\u2014as a highly desirable state, this is at best a precondition for the good life, not constitutive of it. Galen is committed to the notion that human beings have a \u201chigher\u201d good than that implied in the Epicurean ideal; and it seems (though there are textual problems in the passages where he comes closest to addressing the question) that the good may be formulated (a) in terms of an approach to the divine, and/or (b) in terms of the human being\u2019s fulfilment of his or her proper capacities through appropriate activity of body and soul.\nGalen draws on diverse elements in the philosophical tradition, most specifically the Platonic tripartite soul and the Stoic path\u0113, to advance his own distinctive ethical position, which consists of two conceptually separate (though mutually reinforcing) elements. First, one\u2019s non-rational drives must be subjected to appropriate discipline\u2014a discipline which, without the unrealistic aim of total eradication of the path\u0113, nonetheless imposes high normative standards. Secondly, the rational part of the soul must be properly educated, and must fulfil its function appropriately; although a clear definition of the \u201caim of life\u201d corresponding to the good of this rational part of the soul is absent (at least from the extant texts), it is at least strongly implied that scientific or intellectual enquiry constitutes the most appropriate, or highest, realm for this fulfilment of its function.\n",
