    "main_text": "Arguments for Dualism || The Knowledge Argument Against Physicalism\n4.1 The Knowledge Argument Against Physicalism\n\n\nOne category of arguments for dualism is constituted by the standard\nobjections against physicalism. Prime examples are those based on the\nexistence of qualia, the most important of which is the so-called\n\u2018knowledge argument\u2019. Because this argument has its own\nentry (see the entry\n qualia: the knowledge argument),\n I shall deal relatively briefly with it here.  One should bear in\nmind, however, that all arguments against physicalism are also\narguments for the irreducible and hence immaterial nature of the mind\nand, given the existence of the material world, are thus arguments\nfor dualism.\n\n\nThe knowledge argument asks us to imagine a future scientist who has\nlacked a certain sensory modality from birth, but who has acquired a\nperfect scientific understanding of how this modality operates in\nothers. This scientist \u2013 call him Harpo \u2013 may have been\nborn stone deaf, but become the world\u2019s greatest expert on the\nmachinery of hearing: he knows everything that there is to know within\nthe range of the physical and behavioural sciences about hearing.\nSuppose that Harpo, thanks to developments in neurosurgery, has an\noperation which finally enables him to hear. It is suggested that he\nwill then learn something he did not know before, which can be\nexpressed as what it is like to hear, or the\nqualitative or phenomenal nature of sound. These\nqualitative features of experience are generally referred to as\nqualia. If Harpo learns something new, he did not know\neverything before. He knew all the physical facts before. So what he\nlearns on coming to hear \u2013 the facts about the nature of\nexperience or the nature of qualia \u2013 are non-physical. This\nestablishes at least a state or property dualism. (See Jackson 1982;\nRobinson 1982.)\n\n\nThere are at least two lines of response to this popular but\ncontroversial argument. First is the \u2018ability\u2019 response.\nAccording to this, Harpo does not acquire any new factual knowledge,\nonly \u2018knowledge how\u2019, in the form of the ability to respond\ndirectly to sounds, which he could not do before. This essentially\nbehaviouristic account is exactly what the intuition behind the\nargument is meant to overthrow. Putting ourselves in Harpo\u2019s position,\nit is meant to be obvious that what he acquires is knowledge of what\nsomething is like, not just how to do something. Such\nappeals to intuition are always, of course, open to denial by those who\nclaim not to share the intuition. Some ability theorists seem to blur\nthe distinction between knowing what something is like and knowing how\nto do something, by saying that the ability Harpo acquires is to\nimagine or remember the nature of sound. In this\ncase, what he acquires the ability to do involves the\nrepresentation to himself of what the thing is like. But this\nconception of representing to oneself, especially in the form of\nimagination, seems sufficiently close to producing in oneself something\nvery like a sensory experience that it only defers the problem: until\none has a physicalist gloss on what constitutes such representations as\nthose involved in conscious memory and imagination, no progress has\nbeen made.\n\n\nThe other line of response is to argue that, although Harpo\u2019s new\nknowledge is factual, it is not knowledge of a new fact. Rather, it is\nnew way of grasping something that he already knew. He does not realise\nthis, because the concepts employed to capture experience (such as\n\u2018looks red\u2019 or \u2018sounds C-sharp\u2019) are similar to\ndemonstratives, and demonstrative concepts lack the kind of descriptive\ncontent that allow one to infer what they express from other pieces of\ninformation that one may already possess. A total scientific knowledge\nof the world would not enable you to say which time was\n\u2018now\u2019 or which place was \u2018here\u2019. Demonstrative\nconcepts pick something out without saying anything extra about it.\nSimilarly, the scientific knowledge that Harpo originally possessed did\nnot enable him to anticipate what it would be like to re-express some\nparts of that knowledge using the demonstrative concepts that only\nexperience can give one. The knowledge, therefore, appears to be\ngenuinely new, whereas only the mode of conceiving it is novel.\n\n\nProponents of the epistemic argument respond that it is problematic\nto maintain both that the qualitative nature of experience can be\ngenuinely novel, and that the quality itself be the same as some\nproperty already grasped scientifically: does not the experience\u2019s\nphenomenal nature, which the demonstrative concepts capture, constitute\na property in its own right? Another way to put this is to say that\nphenomenal concepts are not pure demonstratives, like\n\u2018here\u2019 and \u2018now\u2019, or \u2018this\u2019 and\n\u2018that\u2019, because they do capture a genuine qualitative\ncontent. Furthermore, experiencing does not seem to consist simply in\nexercising a particular kind of concept, demonstrative or not. When\nHarpo has his new form of experience, he does not simply exercise a new\nconcept; he also grasps something new \u2013 the phenomenal \nquality \u2013 with that concept. How decisive these considerations are,\nremains controversial.\n",
