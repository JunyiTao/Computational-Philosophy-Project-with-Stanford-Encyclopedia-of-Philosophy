    "main_text": "How to Specify the Threshold || Rawls\u2019s Just Savings Principle\n4.5 Rawls\u2019s Just Savings Principle\n\nJohn Rawls was the first to develop a systematic account of\nobligations to future people as a central element of a theory of\njustice (Rawls 1971, 1999, especially section 44; Rawls 1993: 274;\nRawls 2001: especially sections 49.2 and 3). Rawls proposes a\nprinciple of \u201cjust savings\u201d. Long before Rawls Frank\nRamsey developed a model for determining the optimal savings within a\nutilitarian framework (Ramsey 1928; see entry on\n Ramsey and intergenerational welfare economics)\n disregarding distributional considerations. Following Sidgwick (1907\n[1981: 414]) Ramsey (1928: 261) as well as Rawls (1971: 263) and Parfit (1984: appendix\nF) reject what is called \u201cpure time discounting\u201d, that is,\ngiving less weight to the well-being or legitimate claims of future\npeople just because they live in the future. A long-standing issue in\neconomics is how loans and taxes for financing public policies compare\nin terms of the burdens imposed on future generations (see e.g., Pigou\n1920: ch. ix; Viner 1920; Mishan 1963). Provisions to protect the\nwelfare interests of future generations have been in place since\nancient times (Auerbach 1995: 27\u201335; Wissowa et al. 1937: vol.\nxi, 2011, 2014, 2021).\n\nIn proposing a principle of \u201cjust savings\u201d Rawls never\ndiscusses the non-identity-problem and for most of his discussions\n(but see Rawls rev. edition 1999: 141) he assumes that the number of\nfuture people is constant (for criticism see Heyd 1992: 47; Dasgupta\n1994; Casal & Williams 1995; Barry 1999: 107\u2013111; Gosseries\n2001: 330\u2013333). However, his principle of just savings can be\nunderstood to provide us with a substantive understanding of\nintergenerational sufficientarianism. It can be understood as an\ninterpretation of a threshold notion of harm in different number\nchoices (see Reiman 2007; Attas 2009).\n\nRawls specifies the sufficientarian threshold relevant for defining\ncurrently living people\u2019s obligations of justice\nvis-\u00e0-vis future people: \u201cthe conditions needed to\nestablish and to preserve a just basic structure over time\u201d\n(Rawls 2001: 159; on the basic structure as the subject of the\napplication of a sufficientarian principle see also Freiman 2012:\n33\u201337; Meyer 2015). Rawls distinguishes two stages of societal\ndevelopment for the application of his principle of just savings.\nCurrently living people have a justice-based reason to save for future\npeople only if such saving is necessary for allowing future people to\nreach the sufficientarian threshold as specified. This is known as the\naccumulation stage. Once just institutions are securely\nestablished\u2014this is known as the steady-state\nstage\u2014justice does not require people to save for future people.\nRather they should do what is necessary to allow future people to\ncontinue to live under just institutions. Rawls also holds that, in\nthat second stage, people ought to leave their descendants at least\nthe equivalent of what they received from the previous generation (see\nGosseries 2001 for a comparative assessment of Rawls\u2019s\nsubstantive principle). This additional claim can be supported by\negalitarian considerations (see\n \u00a74.1),\n the idea of a presumption in favor of equality (see Sidgwick 1907\n[1981: 379\u2013380], and the entry on\n equality)\n and by the considerations delineated in the next section\n (\u00a74.6).\n\nAs is characteristic of Rawls\u2019s work, he presents the just\nsavings principle as the outcome of a decision reached in the\ncontractualist (hypothetical and non-historical) decision-situation of\nthe original position. Who are the persons in the original position?\nRawls considers an original position in which every generation is\nrepresented. However, as the relations between the contractors so\nconceived are not characterized by the \u201ccircumstances of\njustice\u201d (Rawls 1971: paragraph 22), the question of justice\nas Rawls understands it does not arise: We cannot cooperate with\nprevious generations and, while previous generations can benefit or\nharm us, we cannot benefit or harm them (see\n \u00a71).[13]\n Instead Rawls therefore adjusts the (present-time of entry)\ninterpretation of the original position for the intergenerational\ncontext (Rawls 1993: 274; Rawls 2001: paragraph 25.2). The contractors\nknow that they belong to one generation, but the veil of ignorance\nblinds them to which particular generation they belong (see Gardiner\n2009: esp. 97\u2013116, and Heyd 2009a: esp. 170\u2013176, for a\ncomparative analysis of how contract theories can be extended to the\nsubject matter of intergenerational relations). From the position of\nthe original position the contractors determine a just savings\nrate.\n\nWhile the circumstances of justice clearly hold among contemporaries,\nthe contractors cannot know whether previous generations have saved\nfor them. Why then should they agree to save for future generations?\nIn A Theory of Justice (1971: 284\u2013293), Rawls stipulates \u201ca\nmotivational assumption\u201d according to which the contractors care\nfor their descendants so that they will want to agree to save for\ntheir successors\u2014irrespective of whether previous generations\nsaved for them (for criticism see, e.g., Hubin 1976/77: 70\u201383;\nEnglish 1977: 91\u2013104; Heyd 1992: 41\u201351). In Political\nLiberalism, Rawls withdraws this motivational assumption. He now\nunderstands previous generations\u2019 non-compliance with a just\nsavings principle as a problem of non-ideal theory (Rawls 1993: 274,\nfn. 12; for criticism see, e.g., Dasgupta 1994: 107\u2013108).The\noriginal position, however, belongs to ideal theory: strict compliance\nwith whatever principles are agreed on is assumed (Rawls 1971:\n144\u2013145). Rawls\nintroduces problems of partial and non-compliance only at the level of\nnon-ideal theory (Rawls 1971: ch. iv). In accordance with this understanding of ideal\ntheory, Rawls assumes that the generations are mutually disinterested.\nHe takes the contractors to agree to a savings principle \n\n\nsubject to the further condition that they must want all\nprevious generations to have followed it. \n\n\nRawls continues: \n\n\nThus the correct principle is that which the members of any generation\n(and so all generations) would adopt as the one their generation is to\nfollow and as the principle they would want preceding generations to\nhave followed (and later generations to follow), no matter how far\nback (or forward) in time. (Rawls 1993: 274; Rawls 2001: 160) \n\n\nThe principle of just savings thus agreed on is thought to be binding\nfor all previous and future generations.\n",
