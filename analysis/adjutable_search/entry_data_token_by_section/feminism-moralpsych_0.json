    "main_text": "Moral Motivation\n1. Moral Motivation\n\nThroughout the history of ethics, many moral philosophers have been\nconcerned with the agent\u2019s psychology, or what motivates an\nagent to act. Three stand out as the most prominent foes or friends of\nfeminists: Hobbes, Hume, and Kant. Hobbes believed that self-interest\nmotivates all action, including moral action. For Hobbes, all of a\nperson\u2019s actions aim at the person\u2019s own good as\ndetermined by that person, and rationality requires acting in ways\nthat promote one\u2019s own good, which, for Hobbes, amounts to\nacting in ways that best satisfy one\u2019s desires. Each rational\nperson\u2019s strongest desire is for self-preservation, which\nrationality dictates should never be sacrificed. Thus self-interest or\ndesire-satisfaction prompts action, and both morality and rationality\ndictate acting accordingly. While Hume agreed with Hobbes that reason\nby itself cannot motivate action, he disagreed with Hobbes about the\nmotive that prompted action, believing that instead of self-interest,\nthe feeling or sentiment of sympathy or benevolence is necessary for\nprompting moral action. Reason\u2019s role is to determine the means\nto our ends, not set the ends themselves, which are set by sentiment.\nKant believed, against Hobbes and Hume, that not only could reason\nitself prompt action, but that it is the source of our moral nature.\nReason, for Kant, needs to master desire, rather than dictate the\nsatisfaction of desire, in order for the agent to be autonomous (see,\nfor example, Deigh 1992, 1\u20132).\n\nFeminists have weighed in on these debates. One main charge made by\nsome feminists is that emotion has been associated historically with\nwomen, and for this reason moral philosophers, most of whom have been\nmen, have either ignored it, denigrated it, or included it in moral\ntheory but only as construed in a typically masculine way (Baier,\n1987b; Gilligan 1982 and 1987; Held 1987; Tuana 1992, 1\u201312 and\n113\u2013121). Further, since reason has been associated with men, it\nhas been valorized by the same theories. These feminists imply that\ntraditional moral theory is sexist. Kant, by insisting that reason\nshould master desire, denigrates emotion, and by insisting that reason\nalone can prompt action, ultimately leaves out emotion from morality.\nHobbes, by appealing to the motive of self-interest in his description\nof persons in a State of Nature from which morality must be derived,\nconstrues emotion in a typically masculine way, as the motive\nappropriate for prompting actions with strangers in the so-called\npublic sphere with which men have traditionally been associated\n(Calhoun 1988). Some of the feminists at issue favor Hume\u2019s view\nthat benevolence or sympathy is necessary for prompting moral action\n(Baier 1987a). Some of them believe that one step in the direction of\nending women\u2019s oppression, a goal they share with all feminists,\nis to incorporate into our philosophical theories those things that\nhave been heretofore excluded precisely because of their association\nwith women (Baier 1987b; Held, 1987). Such feminists reject both\nKant\u2019s view, that reason should master desire, and\nHobbes\u2019s view, that self-interest is the motive that prompts\nmoral action, and favor including in moral theory those motives that\nhave traditionally been associated with women. These are motives\nappropriate to prompting action with intimates in the so-called\nprivate sphere to which (at least white, middle class) women have\nhistorically been relegated. Foremost among them is the motive of\ncare, exhibited by women who have been charged with the role of\nraising children. But feminists are not univocal in their views about\nthe role of emotion in moral theory. Other feminists caution that\nincorporating \u201cfeminine\u201d emotions into moral theory risks\nperpetuating women\u2019s oppression by leaving unchallenged the view\nthat women are essentially emotional beings, and men essentially\nrational beings (Tronto 1993, 241\u2013247; Tuana 1992,\n115\u2013116).\n\nFeminists\u2019s responses on both sides of the issue have been\nmultifarious. It is important to note that some philosophers,\nindependent of feminist motivations, challenge the charge that\ntraditional moral theory denigrates or ignores emotion, arguing that\nit can at least make room for it. For instance, Barbara Herman (1981)\nand Marcia Baron (1984) argue that Kant need not, or even should not,\nexclude emotion altogether from his theory. Herman argues against the\nview that in order for an act to have moral worth, it must be done\nwithout the presence of any inclination, but only from the moral\nmotive, or, for the sake of duty. Herman agrees that acts having moral\nworth must be done from the moral motive, but argues that the received\ninterpretation of Kant is wrong in assuming that inclination must not\nbe present. Regarding morally obligatory actions, Herman argues that\ninclination may be present as long as the agent\u2019s final motive\nis the moral one. Regarding morally permissible actions, Herman argues\nthat the moral motive functions as a limiting condition, screening out\ninclinations that take as their object action conflicting with the\nCategorical Imperative. In the ordinary case, the agent has both\ninclination and the moral motive present, with inclination giving the\nmoral motive its object. Baron takes the role of inclination one step\nfurther, arguing that inclination must be present in the\nperfectly moral person. This is because Baron understands the moral\nmotive in a Kantian way rather than strictly as Kant understood it, as\na commitment to morality instead of something we must hold before our\nminds each time we act. Thus it can function either as a primary\nmotive, motivating the agent without the aid of inclination, or as a\nsecondary motive, as a commitment to doing what is right, telling the\nagent to act as inclination directs. But these modest attempts to\nincorporate emotion into a moral theory that at first blush seems to\nignore emotion or makes reason its master do not address the feminist\ncharge that \u201cfeminine\u201d motivation is left out of or\ndenigrated by traditional moral theory, and is so because of its\nassociation with women.\n\nOther philosophers writing particularly from a feminist view favor\nendorsing any traditional moral theory that incorporates\n\u201cfeminine\u201d motivation. Annette Baier favors a Humean\naccount over Kant\u2019s, arguing that Hume is the\n\u201cwoman\u2019s moral theorist\u201d(1987). While Baier\nacknowledges that Hume had less than feminist views since he saw women\nas weaker than men in mind and body, she believes that nonetheless\nHume\u2019s theory squares with women\u2019s moral wisdom, both in\nthe concept of morality that many women have, and in their experiences\nthat lead them to have it (38). Baier contrasts Hume\u2019s moral\ntheory with Kant\u2019s, specifically in connection to Carol\nGilligan\u2019s conclusions about men\u2019s and women\u2019s moral\nreasoning (see below; 1982). Gilligan is a psychologist who set out to\ncollect data about women\u2019s moral reasoning, which she noted was\nnot reflected in the experiments conducted just on males by another\npsychologist, Lawrence Kohlberg (see the entry on\n feminist ethics).\n Baier notes the following differences between Kant and Hume, which\nshe takes to resemble those Gilligan suggested between the women she\nstudied and Kohlberg\u2019s men. Kant makes morality a matter of\nobedience to universal law through which we obtain freedom, but Hume\nmakes it a matter of cultivating character traits directed at peace of\nmind and integrity; Kant takes reason to be the fundamental moral\ncapacity, and Hume takes sympathy, or the heart\u2019s responses to\nparticular persons, to be this capacity; Kant takes the rules of\njustice to be morally binding, while Hume emphasizes convention and\neradicating contradictions in the passions of sympathetic persons.\nHume also emphasizes relations between unequals, such as in\nparents\u2019 love for their children, which he believed to be the\nstrongest bond the mind is capable of, and from which he builds his\nmoral theory. Gilligan presented data from female and male subjects\nshowing that by and large, females made decisions about moral dilemmas\nbased on concrete situations in which the parties know details about\neach other, emphasizing feelings such as care for others, and\npreserving relations, while males for the most part decided on the\nbasis of rule-following and justice while abstracting from the details\nof the case. This is not to say that Gilligan\u2019s claims are free\nfrom controversy; rather, since she published the results of her\nstudy, her claims have been criticized for perpetuating sexist\nstereotypes (Tronto 1993), for being inaccurate both because there are\nnot significant differences in the reasoning of males and females at\ndifferent life stages (Walker 1993), and because any differences in\nmoral reasoning have more to do with education or general cognitive\ndevelopment rather than gender (Greeno and Maccoby 1993), for being\nfalse because her sample size and characterizations are inadequate for\ndrawing the conclusions she does about gendered reasoning (Luria 1993)\nand for invoking generalizations that can be used to support racist\nviews (Moody-Adams 1991, 199). These objections aside, Baier argues\nthat Gilligan\u2019s data about females\u2019 moral reasoning is\naligned with Hume\u2019s theory, while data about males\u2019 moral\nreasoning is aligned with other justice-oriented theories such as\nKant\u2019s and Hobbes\u2019s. Baier endorses Hume\u2019s theory as\nmore amiable to feminism since it speaks more accurately to\nwomen\u2019s experiences than Kantian or other justice-oriented\ntheories, particularly women\u2019s experience of care-taking\nrelationships that require knowing the particularities of the persons\ninvolved.\n\nSince Gilligan\u2019s findings were published, some feminists have\ngone beyond endorsing Hume\u2019s theory by valorizing women\u2019s\ncaring in a new moral theory, the ethic of care, which is grounded at\nleast in part on acting from the motive of care (see the entry on\n feminist ethics).\n What makes the feminist complaint against traditional moral theories\ndifferent from that of philosophers such as Michael Stocker (1976),\nwho argues that modern moral theories are \u201cschizophrenic\u201d\nbecause they pay attention only to reasons, values, and justification\nwhile saying little if anything about motives, is that it is lodged\nfor the feminist reason that women\u2019s voice has been excluded\nfrom moral theory, and that care, specifically, is the motive left\nout. The motive of care is prominent in relations among family\nmembers, particularly of mother to child. Since traditional moral\ntheories are concerned primarily with mores that ought to govern\nrelations between strangers in the public sphere, they leave out\ndiscussion of caring that goes on in relations in the so-called\nprivate sphere among intimates, especially the mother-child relation.\nAnd since women historically have been relegated to the private\nsphere, much of the moral life as they experience it within the family\ngets left out. Feminists who endorse the ethic of care thus aim to\nvalorize care in moral theory, thereby giving women a moral voice\nequal to men\u2019s.\n\nMost care ethicists believe that the motive of care, not just\nacting in a caring way, is central to, and is a distinguishing feature\nof, the ethic of care (for example, Ruddick 1980; Noddings, 1984;\nBaier 1987b; Calhoun 1988; Held 1990), but at least one suggests that\ncaring does not require any particular emotion toward the one cared\nfor (Manning 1992, 64). Some feminists favor incorporating care into\njustice theories (Friedman 1987; Tronto 1993; Flanagan and Jackson\n1987; Blum 1988), though others suggest that we altogether replace\njustice theories with an ethic of care (Gilligan, 1982 and 1987;\nNoddings 1984; Ruddick 1980). Those in the latter group believe that\nmoral action is prompted by the motive of care rather than by reason\nitself.\n\nMargaret Little argues that the motive of care plays a significant\nrole in moral epistemology: it is essential for seeing the moral\nlandscape, that is, for knowing what is morally called for in a given\nsituation, and for getting us to moral truths (Little 2007). Little\nshares the same suspicion as the feminists cited above that care has\nbeen assigned a \u201clesser\u201d role than reason because of its\nhistorical association with women. Little argues that when we care\nabout a person, we have the right background disposition for morally\nrelevant features to come into our consciousness. Caring makes us\nreceptive to the particularities of a person, enables us to listen to\ntheir narrative, and makes us respect the person as a responsible\nsubject. Only when we are so disposed do we know what is morally\ncalled for\u2014caring about persons enables us to pick up on what is\nmorally salient (424\u201325). Those who have merely an intellectual\ncomprehension of the moral landscape but never respond appropriately\nhave a clouded perception, much like a person who uses the term\n\u201cgreen\u201d correctly but has never seen the color and so\nlacks the concept of \u201cgreen\u201d (427). Little argues that the\nmoral case is even worse than the color case because those who lack\nthe appropriate emotions will not get morality right. Such is the case\nwith the person who sees that certain things are painful and knows\nwhat pain is, yet does not see pain as evil. This person does not get\nmorality right because, first, nonmoral terms cannot completely\nexplain morality (e.g., they cannot explain the difference in the\ncruelty of kicking a dog, taunting someone verbally, and forgetting to\ninvite the neighbor\u2019s child to one\u2019s daughter\u2019s\nbirthday party) (428). A second reason is that whether a feature plays\na role in determining an act\u2019s moral status is dependent, in a\nway that cannot be codified, on other relevant features. For instance,\nan act\u2019s being fun may be a reason to do it, but it is also a\nfeature that makes hunting animals morally problematic (428). Little\nconcludes that affect, particularly care for persons, is a necessary\ncomponent of apprehending moral properties themselves, contrary to\ntraditional accounts, according to which moral knowledge is acquired\nstrictly by reason whose verdicts are passed on to motivation which in\nturn issues in the appropriate response (420, 428).\n\nAlthough the ethic of care is still in a fairly developmental stage,\ndefended more fully in a 2006 book by Virginia Held, it has been\ncriticized by some feminists as being merely a feminine, but\nnot a feminist, moral theory. A feminine ethic gives weight\nto the experiences and intuitions of women, but it need not aim at\nending women\u2019s oppression; a feminist ethic has as one of its\naims ending women\u2019s oppression. If care is a motive that women\nexperience mainly in connection with their being in a position of\nexploitation, then one worry is that valorizing it in moral theory\ndoes not overcome, but may even perpetuate, its role in women\u2019s\noppression. Sarah Hoagland, for instance, criticizes the ethic of care\nfor at least three reasons: that it is grounded in the unequal\nrelationship of a mother having natural care for her child which may\nnot, especially in a male child, ever be reciprocated; that it fails\nto acknowledge the real conflict that some mothers feel between\nresentment and tenderness; and that in appealing to the feminine which\nis itself a product of the masculine world, it risks perpetuating\nwomen\u2019s oppression (Hoagland 1991, 253, 254, and 256). Marilyn\nFriedman critiques the kind of care involved in the ethic of care.\nWhile men\u2019s caring, as revealed in earning a paycheck and\nproviding material goods for the family, has to do with protection and\nmaterial forms of help that men control, women\u2019s caring, as\nrevealed in emotional work, has to do with admitting dependency and\nsharing or losing control, which contributes to their own oppression\n(Friedman 1993, 175 and 177). Lawrence Blum, et.al., argue that\nwomen\u2019s caring reinforces the suppression of the self and leads\nto a denial of their autonomy, and makes mothers judge their success\nsolely in terms of the success of their children, making them lose\ntouch with their own needs (Blum, et.al. 1973\u201374, 231\u201332,\n235, and 239). Claudia Card argues that sometimes the caring that\nwomen engage in is not virtuous, but instead is misplaced gratitude to\nmen who either have the power to abuse them or offer women the\nprivilege of service in exchange for \u201cprotection\u201d (Card\n1993, 216). Women\u2019s caring is often a survival strategy, and so\nGilligan is wrong to think that women\u2019s reasoning can deepen and\ncorrect the ethics of the more privileged (207). Card believes that\ntoo often women do not discriminate good from bad relationships, and\nend up assuming responsibility for maintaining any relationships they\ncome to be involved in by trying to satisfy everyone because they are\nafraid to say \u201cno.\u201d Barbara Houston cautions that if care,\nlike anything else in ethics, is declared good or right or just, it\nhad better be so for women (Houston 1987, 261). While Houston agrees\nwith the feminist intention to reclaim womanly virtues as virtues in\nthe face of their absence from contemporary moral theory, she cautions\nthat these virtues, including care, should win the liberation of\nwomen, make women\u2019s subordination a primary moral concern, make\nit a recognizable moral problem rather than a nonmoral matter,\nchallenge the status quo of women\u2019s social position, and not\nfurther women\u2019s oppression (255).\n\nIn spite of the vast amount of attention feminists have paid to the\nethic of care, and perhaps in light of the worries about care and\nwomen\u2019s oppression, some feminists have turned their attention\naway from making the motive of care central in moral theory. Jean\nHampton tries to salvage Hobbesian moral theory, and believes that\nfeminists should make the motive of self-interest part of their moral\ntheory because without it women lose themselves in slavish action\n(1993). They become just like Amy, a girl that Gilligan describes in\none of her discussions of gendered moral reasoning. Hampton reads\nGilligan\u2019s much-discussed case of Amy and Jake in the following\nway. Amy reasons from the care perspective, seeing morality as being\nresponsive to others\u2019 needs, not hurting others, and being in\nservice to them. She loses herself in moral dilemmas, not being able\nfirmly to assert herself or let her interests count, but always places\nthe needs of others first. She borders on servility and lacks\nself-worth. Jake, on the other hand, a representative male moral\nreasoner, reasons from the justice perspective, seeing morality as a\nset of traffic rules that amount to pursuing one\u2019s own interests\nwithout interfering with the interests of others. Jake is insensitive\nto the needs of others, and sees the world from his own self-centered\nviewpoint, believing that one\u2019s own self ought to come first in\nmoral dilemmas. Hampton argues that neither is the ideal moral view,\nbut that Amy suffers more because she is highly exploitable. Hampton\nfavors a contractarian morality over the ethic of care, since on the\nformer a person is prompted by self-interest in putting forward claims\nwith other potential contractors to the hypothetical bargain from\nwhich morality is ultimately derived. A Hobbesian hypothetical\nbargainer will not make or keep contracts that do not provide an\nexpectation of self-benefit. Hampton argues that self-interest, not\ncare, is the motive women should have if they are to avoid being\nexploited, since self-interest ensures that a person insists on her\nown worth in bargaining schemes and relations with others. To address\nother feminists\u2019s worries about contractarianism excluding from\nbargains those from whom others do not expect to benefit in\ninteractions, including typically the disenfranchised, Hampton\nmodifies contractarianism by building in the Kantian assumption that\nall persons have intrinsic value and thus must have their interests\nrespected.\n\nOne important issue relating to moral motivation that feminists have\nsaid only a bit about is the internalism/externalism debate (see the\nentry on\n moral motivation).\n Generally stated, internalism is the view that there is a logical or\nnecessary connection between two concepts, typically reasons, motives,\nand obligations. According to one version of internalism, which David\nBrink calls \u201cagent internalism,\u201d in virtue of the concept\nof morality, moral obligations (or moral reasons, on a two-step\ninternalism linking obligations, reasons, and motives) necessarily\nmotivate the agent to act morally (see Brink 1986, 28). The\nagent\u2019s having a reason to act morally, whether or not the agent\nrecognizes it, entails having a motive to act morally. Externalism is\nthe denial of the necessity condition. According to another version of\ninternalism, if an agent judges that it is right for her to \u03c6 in\ncircumstances C, then either she is motivated to \u03c6, or she is\nirrational (Smith, 1994, 61; Korsgaard 1996). Motivation is\nnecessarily present in the rational agent who recognizes a reason to\nact morally; having a reason to act morally entails having a\nmotivation, at least in the rational agent. The corresponding\nexternalist view is that judging that an act is right either need not\nmotivate the rational agent (weak externalism) or does not motivate\nthe rational agent (strong externalism).\n\nTwo issues relating to the internalism/externalism debate bear on\nwomen\u2019s oppression. First, on agent internalism, if the agent\nlacks the relevant motivation, the agent does not have a reason to act\nmorally (see Brink 1986, 29). Then for agents who lack a motivation to\nact in ways preventing women\u2019s oppression, they lack a reason to\ndo so. This means that oppressors who lack the relevant motivation do\nnot act against reason when they act in ways contributing to\nwomen\u2019s oppression. Second, on the other version of internalism\ndescribed above, if the agent fails to be motivated by a moral reason,\nthe agent still has the reason but is irrational (Smith 1994;\nKorsgaard 1996). Then agents who recognize that they have a reason to\nbe self-respecting, for instance, but who fail to be so, are\nirrational. This runs the risk of impugning the rationality of\noppressed persons who fail to see their intrinsic worth as persons due\nto their social circumstances.\n\nAlthough feminists have not addressed the problems for feminism\nrelated to agent internalism, at least two feminists have identified\nproblems with internalism in general, as a logical thesis about the\nconnection between motives and reasons and/or obligations. Peggy\nDesAutels explores the phenomenon of having a moral commitment to the\nethic of care yet failing to follow through on it even when the agent\nis competent and does not ignore her moral commitments (2004).\nDesAutels approaches the issue of internalism from an empirical rather\nthan a conceptual point of view, which sets apart her approach from\nthat of standard internalists. She takes herself to be following\nfeminist theorists such as Carol Gilligan and Margaret Urban Walker in\nexamining moral issues, including that of the internalism/externalism\ndebate, as they present themselves in richly detailed concrete\nsituations, which, she believes, makes her account feminist (71).\nDesAutels argues that moral attentiveness requires \u201cnonpassive\nvigilance of thought where we attempt to counter known psychological\ntendencies and subtle social influences that prevent us from seeing\nand responding to the demands of care\u201d (72). Two interferences\nwith the demands of care are moral oblivion, or, being completely or\nmostly unaware of a moral demand, and being unresponsive to moral\nsituations. DesAutels urges that we attempt to improve both our own\npsychologies and the social contexts in which they are embedded by,\nfor instance, becoming more receptive to the subtle ways in which\nsexism occurs. She is suggesting that, contra internalism, it is\npossible to make a moral judgment yet fail to be appropriately\nmotivated, due to sexist influences; sexism can make us unaware of a\nmoral demand or unresponsive to it. Attention to the impact of sexism\nand other forms of oppression that are revealed in concrete situations\nis a lens that reveals a limitation of internalism as a purely\nconceptual issue about what it means to have a moral reason.\n\nJames Lindemann Nelson argues that internalists who endorse a\nnecessary connection between moral judgment and motivation fail to\ncapture the idea that the agent\u2019s judgment might come in degrees\nof confidence in the correctness of her judgment or the exigency of\nthe values involved (2004, 84). Nelson argues that the\nbelief-motivation relationship is more complex in the real world than\ninternalists admit. He takes internalism and externalism to be points\non a scale registering the relationship between an agent and the moral\nunderstandings considered authoritative in her moral-social world.\nThus contra internalism, it is not the case that if the agent acts\nimmorally, she simply must not have believed the relevant moral\njudgment. Rather, the connection between moral belief and action\nshould be sensitive to the highly variegated character of the\nmoral-social world and the different locations within it that real\npeople inhabit (89). Nelson rejects the standard view of internalism\nas a logical connection between belief and motivation, in favor of the\nview that internalism reflects the degrees to which a person grasps\nmoral beliefs and to which she acts on these beliefs. So if one lacks\na strong sense of what one ought to do, this need not mean that one\ncompletely lacks an authentic belief about what one ought to do.\nNelson understands his account to be feminist because it critiques the\nforms of social life. That is, it is sensitive to the fact that a\nperson\u2019s own moral beliefs and reasons may not be consistent\nwith the moral beliefs and reasons held widely in her society,\nespecially when it is a sexist one. A person might truly believe that\nher society takes something to be morally required, but not be fully\nmotivated by her society\u2019s moral requirements because they\ndictate sexist behavior. Nelson\u2019s account allows a person to\nrefuse to fully embrace motivating reasons that are endorsed by her\nsociety, and still have moral authority.\n\nFeminists might also question whether the internalist is correct in\nthinking that if an otherwise rational person fails to be motivated by\nher moral judgment, then she is irrational. Consider an example that I\nwill return to in Section 2, Thomas Hill\u2019s well-known case of\nthe Deferential Wife, who is utterly devoted to her husband, buying\nclothes he prefers, having sex when he is in the mood, and moving\nwhere he wants. She tends not to form her own interests, values, and\nideals, and counts them as less important than her husband\u2019s\nwhen she does. She believes that women are mentally and physically\nequal, if not superior to men, but that it is women\u2019s proper\nrole to serve their husbands. She does not believe that her rights are\nbeing trampled on because she is glad and proud to serve her husband.\nShe is confused about her worth as a person, and is servile, or,\nlacking in self-respect, despite being glad and proud to serve her\nhusband (Hill 1973). A legitimate explanation for the Deferential\nWife\u2019s confusion about her worth is her socialization in a\npatriarchal society which sends her many messages of inferiority. Her\nconfusion about her worth prevents her from being motivated by a\nreason to be self-respecting. An internalist might impugn her\nrationality: if she truly recognizes that she has a reason to be\nself-respecting, yet remains unmoved, she must be irrational. But the\ninternalist\u2019s judgment that she is irrational seems at odd with\nfeminist aims, since it fails to acknowledge the role that\nsocialization plays in whether she is motivated by the reasons she\nhas. It places the blame for failing to be motivated by a reason\nsquarely on the victim of such circumstances and her rational\ncapacities, when it may be the case that the Deferential Wife reasons\ncorrectly, understands what it means to have intrinsic worth, sees\nthat if a person had intrinsic worth she would respect herself, but\ngets the facts wrong about her own worth due to her experiences. The\nfeminist objection is that a person\u2019s social circumstances are a\nbetter explanation of the disconnection between reasons and\nmotivations than a failure of rationality (Superson 2010).\n",
