    "main_text": "Can Creativity be Explained?\n4. Can Creativity be Explained?\n\nUpon observing the work of creative people, it is natural to wonder:\nHow do they do that? How do people create? The issue we turn to now is\nwhether we could, at least in principle, answer this question\nscientifically, using the methods of modern empirical\npsychology and other cognitive and behavioral sciences. Those who take\na negative stance on this matter are not merely saying that, in\npractice, it would be exceedingly difficult for science to explain\ncreativity. They are saying that it\u2019s altogether impossible that\nscience could ever explain creativity.\n\nHospers (1985) defends this kind of pessimism based on the variety and\ncomplexity of creativity, given that creativity occurs not only in\nart, but in science, theorizing of any sort, engineering, business,\nmedicine, sport, gaming, and so on. At least two worries may follow.\nFirst, given the complexity of any one of these individual domains,\none might worry that there are simply too many variables to allow for\na clear explanation. Art provides a paradigmatic example. Consider an\nartwork that you judge to be masterful (a sculpture, a painting, a\nfilm). Now imagine attempting to describe or identify all the reasons\nfor which you think it is masterful. Take as much time as you like\nbut, the skeptic will urge, any long description you construct will\ninvariably strike you as woefully incomplete by comparison to the\nartwork, and the experience thereof. So, if the creative achievements\nof artists, in all of their complexity, cannot even be adequately\ndescribed, we have little reason to think that such achievements can\nbe explained.\n\nHow can theorists respond to these skeptical worries? Both the\ncomplexity and generalizability worries might be partially disarmed by\nnoting analogies between creativity and other phenomena. For instance,\nconsider the range of bodily movement involved in some of the very\ndomains of activities listed above: art, science, engineering,\nmedicine, sport. The kinds of bodily action specific to these domains\nare complex and vary dramatically: the relevant physical movements of\nthe surgeon are much different from the tennis player. However, it is\nnot plausible that this complexity and variety precludes explanation\nof bodily action in those domains. It simply implies that some\nfeatures of the explanation will be context-sensitive, that is,\nspecific to that domain of activity. And further to the analogy: the\nfact that the long description of, say, the tennis serve is incomplete\ndoes not preclude it from being apt and explanatory. If this line of\nreasoning is sound for bodily action, why not also for creative\naction?\n\nAt this point, one might argue that while complexity and\ngeneralizability worries would only show that creativity is difficult\nto explain in practice, the very nature of creativity implies, more\nstrongly, that it could never be explained, not even in principle.\nResources to support this kind of pessimism may be adduced from\nvarious past philosophers. We need to tread carefully, however, since\nmost of the figures we are about to consider were writing long before\nthe rise of the relevant sciences, so they could not have made any\nexplicit claim either way as to whether creativity could be explained\nby those sciences. Nevertheless, some of them did make claims which\nentail, or seem to entail, that creativity simply isn\u2019t the kind\nof thing that could be explained through scientific inquiry as we\nunderstand it today.\n\nThe classic expression of such a view comes from Plato. In his\ndialogues, Plato features his teacher Socrates as a spokesperson for\nhis own views, and in the Ion he has Socrates argue that\npoets do not produce poetry through knowledge or skill. When you\nexercise a skill (techn\u0113), you apply techniques, rules,\nor methods to perform a given activity, like charioteering, fishing,\nor commanding an army. In principle, one could explain these\nactivities by identifying the techniques they involve, and a student\nor apprentice could learn these activities by applying and practicing\nthose techniques. But poetry is not like that, in Socrates\u2019\nview. A poet can only imitate the application of rules or techniques,\nmimicking the surface appearance of skill. Voicing an idea that was\nfamiliar in Ancient Greek culture, Socrates suggests that poetry\nemerges instead through divine inspiration, whereby a human being is\ninspired\u2014literally \u201cfilled with a spirit\u201d,\nwith a god or goddess, with a muse:\n\n\nYou know, none of the epic [or lyric] poets, if they\u2019re good,\nare masters of their subject; they are inspired, possessed, and that\nis how they utter all those beautiful poems. \u2026 [They] are not\nin their right minds when they make those beautiful lyrics, but as\nsoon as they sail into harmony and rhythm they are possessed by\nBacchic frenzy. [\u2026] For a poet is an airy thing, winged and\nholy, and he is not able to make poetry until he becomes inspired and\ngoes out of his mind and his intellect is no longer in him. As long as\na human being has his intellect in his possession he will always lack\nthe power to make poetry or sing prophecy. [\u2026] You see,\nit\u2019s not mastery [techn\u0113] that enables them to\nspeak those verses, but a divine power. That\u2019s why the god takes\ntheir intellect away from them when he uses them as his servants, as\nhe does prophets and godly diviners, so that we who hear should know\nthat they are not the ones who speak those verses that are of\nsuch high value, for their intellect is not in them: the god himself\nis the one who speaks, and he gives voice through them to us. In this\nmore than anything, then, I think, the god is showing us, so that we\nshould be in no doubt about it, that these beautiful poems are not\nhuman, not even from human beings, but are divine and from\ngods; that poets are nothing but representatives of the gods,\npossessed by whoever possesses them. (Ion 534a-d)\n\n\nSocrates repeats this view in the Phaedrus: \u201cSome of\nthe greatest blessings come by way of madness, indeed madness that is\nheaven-sent\u201d (244a). He adds that while a poet may have some\nkind of skill, anyone who aspires to make poetry purely by skill,\nwithout the madness or the muse, will fail (245a).\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that \u201cmadness\u201d, for Plato, is\na supernatural affair. From the vantage of contemporary behavioral\nscience, we think of madness\u2014or rather, mental illness\u2014as\na pathology arising from some combination of genetic and environmental\nfactors, and those factors can be studied scientifically. So even if\ncreativity is linked to mental illness\u2014a highly controversial\nproposition\u2014it could still be entirely within the scope of\nscience. However, Plato\u2019s talk of \u201cmadness\u201d does not\nrefer to any naturally occurring pathology, but rather to the result\nof divine intervention: the poet is taken over or\n\u201cpossessed\u201d by the muse and that is precisely why he is\n\u201cout of his mind\u201d. Plato\u2019s poet suffers\ndivine madness.\n\nAccording to this story, then, the person we call a poet isn\u2019t\nreally a creator of poetry, but is merely the vessel through which a\ndivine being delivers poetry. If it is literally true that the source\nof poetry is supernatural, then poetic creativity could never be\nexplained by science, which is limited to the investigation of natural\ncauses. (For more on Plato, see Asmis 1992.)\n\nThis kind of supernaturalism has enjoyed a long afterlife in Western\nthought. In ancient Rome, the Latin term \u201cgenius\u201d\nreferred to a guiding spirit that was thought to accompany each person\nthroughout their lives. The genius of an artist would\noccasionally deliver art through that person in the manner of Platonic\ninspiration.\n\nConceptions of the artist take a new turn when the idea of genius is\ntransformed in the eighteenth century. As we saw above, Immanuel Kant\ndefines genius as a natural capacity that a certain kind of\nartist possesses innately and which partly constitutes that\nartist\u2019s identity. So rather than saying that a gifted artist\n\u201chas a genius\u201d, Kant says that such a person \u201cis a\ngenius\u201d. What distinguishes the genius is fundamentally an\nimaginative capacity\u2014an ability to engage in a \u201cfree\nplay\u201d of imagination to produce artworks of \u201cexemplary\noriginality\u201d. These works are exemplary not only in the sense\nthat they have artistic or aesthetic value, unlike \u201coriginal\nnonsense\u201d; they are also exemplary in the more radical sense of\nproviding an exemplar\u2014a new paradigm and precedent\u2014for\nlesser artists to follow. A work of genius sets a new standard of\nartistic value, and, looking to that exemplar, lesser artists may then\nextract techniques or rules for their own craft. The genius therefore\n\u201cgives the rule to art\u201d. In creating such works, the\ngenius does not follow any rules or methods. Instead the genius\ncreates art through a \u201cfree play of\nimagination\u201d\u2014where the terms \u201cfree\u201d and\n\u201cplay\u201d characterize the nature of an activity\nunconstrained by any pre-established methods or rules:\n\n\n[G]enius \u2026 is a talent for producing that for which no\ndeterminate rule can be given, not a predisposition of skill for that\nwhich can be learned in accordance with some rule \u2026. (1790:\n\u00a746 5:307\u20138; 2000 trans., 186)\n\n\nKant thought that genius, so conceived, is limited to the fine arts,\npoetry being chief among them. Meanwhile, in Kant\u2019s view, there\nis no room for genius in science, for example, where good theories and\nhypotheses must emerge from the careful application of scientific\nmethod, and so he said that even Isaac Newton, \u201cthat great man\nof science\u201d, was not a genius. We\u2019ll soon consider why\nthis view might seem to entail that creativity is inexplicable, but\nfirst it will be helpful to bring another figure, Arthur Schopenhauer,\nwho was deeply influenced both by Kant and by Plato.\n\nLike Kant, Schopenhauer thought of genius as a natural capacity that\nis limited to the fine arts. He also echoes Plato\u2019s sentiments\nabout madness, famously stating that \u201cgenius and madness have a\nside where they touch and even pass over into each other\u201d\n(The World as Will and Representation, 1859, WWV I: 190), and\nthat \u201cGenius lives only one storey above madness\u201d\n(Parerga and Paralipomena, SW 2:53, PP 2:49). In a state of\nmadness, Schopenhauer\u2019s genius is like Plato\u2019s poet in\nexperiencing a momentary loss of self, but what displaces the self is\nnot any divine being but rather a pure Idea which seizes the\nauthor\u2019s being and becomes the object of both his fascination\nand his artistic expression:\n\n\nWe lose ourselves entirely in this object, to use a pregnant\nexpression; in other words, we forget our individuality, our will, and\ncontinue to exist only as pure subject, as clear mirror of the object,\nso that it is as though the object alone existed without anyone to\nperceive it, and thus we are no longer able to separate the perceiver\nfrom the perception, but the two have become one, since the entire\nconsciousness is filled and occupied by a single image of perception.\n(World WWV I: 178\u2013179, \u00a734). \n\n\nWith their focus on genius construed as a natural capacity, figures\nlike Kant and Schopenhauer abandon the supernaturalism of the Platonic\nmuse. Nevertheless, they retain the idea that\ncreativity\u2014specifically genius-level creativity in the fine\narts\u2014is not a matter of exercising a skill or applying given\nrules, methods, or techniques.\n\nAs we noted earlier, these figures did not and could not have\nexplicitly denied that creativity could be explained by the sciences\nof the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, but they are commonly\ntaken to represent such a denial (Kronfeldner 2018). Why?\n\nPerhaps figures like Kant and Schopenhauer seem to make creativity, or\nat least creative genius, inexplicable insofar they suppose it to be\ninnate and as they have no story to tell about how one came to acquire\nan innate capacity except to say that it was either an accident of\nchance (which is no explanation at all) or a gift from God (which\nagain is not a scientific explanation). But while these figures seemed\nto think of artistic genius as being endowed entirely by nature with\nno contribution from nurture, modern genetic theory rejects that\ndichotomy. Instead of positing all-or-nothing natural abilities,\nbehavioral scientists today think in terms of genetically inherited\npredispositions. In order for a genetic predisposition to develop into\na trait with an observable phenotype, it needs to be triggered and\nshaped through a complex interaction between an organism\u2019s genes\nand certain kinds of stimuli or environmental conditions. There are\nstill open questions about exactly how, and how much, genes and\nenvironment feed into the development of any given trait, but\nit\u2019s misguided to pose the binary nature-versus-nurture question\nas if the two were mutually exclusive (see Tabery 2014). Many\nresearchers agree that some people have a stronger natural\npredisposition toward creativity than others, and that genius-level\ncreativity partly stems from such a predisposition. Even so, the\npredisposition itself can be understood scientifically in terms of\ngenetic heritability. (For a sampling of the relevant studies, see the\nessays collected in S.B. Kaufman 2013.)\n\nPerhaps creativity seems inexplicable according to these accounts\nbecause it doesn\u2019t follow rules or methods. In order to explain\nhow to do something\u2014how to build a boat or lead an army\netc.\u2014perhaps I need to be able to identify the rules or methods\nyou should follow in order to practice and apply those skills.\nHow-to explanations are instructions. But scientific\nexplanations needn\u2019t be instructions. A lot of good science\nexplains how something happens\u2014e.g., how heat melts ice\nor how a bat navigates its environment by echolocation\u2014without\nexplaining how to do it yourself.\n\nPerhaps creativity seems inexplicable according to these accounts\nbecause creators themselves do not know how they create. But a\nscientific explanation needn\u2019t be available through\nintrospection. Most people cannot explain how their own digestive,\ncirculatory, or perceptual systems work, but scientists who study\nthose systems can.\n\nAnother line of thought is perhaps implicit in Kant but comes to the\nfore in Schopenhauer, who says that \u201cthe nature of genius\nconsists precisely in the preeminent ability\u201d to\n\n\nconsider things independently of the principle of sufficient\nreason, in contrast to the way of considering which proceeds in\nexact accordance with this principle, and is the way of science and\nexperience. (World WWV: I: 192, \u00a736)\n\n\nThe principle of sufficient reason says that for every fact there is a\ncause which completely explains that fact. So the defining ability of\ngenius is to see things in a way that transcends the causal order and\ndefies all explanation.\n\nA version of this view is defended more recently by Carl Hausman (1975\n[1984], 1979, 1985) who frames it in terms of novelty that creativity\ninvolves. Hausman asserts that if a product is creative, it must be\nmetaphysically novel (or in his terms, \u201cgenuinely\nnovel\u201d) in the sense that it cannot be predicted from, or\nexplained by, prior events\u2014not even in principle. Creativity is\ntherefore incompatible with causal determination and causal\nexplanation: \u201cA causal view of explanation sets a framework for\nways of denying that there is anything new under the sun\u201d\n(Hausman 1984: ix). If something can be explained by prior causes, it\nis not metaphysically novel, and is therefore, in Hausman\u2019s\nview, not truly creative.\n\nAgainst Hausman\u2019s skeptical charge, Maria Kronfeldner (2009)\nargues that creativity is compatible with causal determination. First,\ncausal determinism does not preclude novelty or change. Determinism\nsays the emergence of new kinds of things can at least in principle be\npredicted in advance. Importantly, though, when this prediction\nbecomes true, then something new is added to the world. Of course, not\nall novelty instantiates creativity. The question is whether the kind\nof novelty involved in creativity must be metaphysical novelty, which\nis by definition incompatible with causal determination. This is\ndoubtful. Notice that, by definition, metaphysical novelty defies\nnatural laws. The production of something metaphysically novel would\ntherefore require supernatural powers. Traditional Western religions\nconceive of God as performing the miracle of creation ex\nnihilo. But are we positing a miracle every time we describe a\nhuman artifact or achievement as creative? Surely not. As noted above,\nhuman creativity is manifest in things that are novel relative to the\nagent producing them or new to human history, but both of those kinds\nof novelty (psychological and historical) are perfectly compatible\nwith causal determination. As Kronfeldner explains, creativity does\nnot preclude causes in general; it only precludes certain\nkinds of causes. A creative product, she argues, must be\noriginal\u2014which means that it cannot be produced through\na process of copying something prior. And it must be\nspontaneous (not produced through a routine or mechanical\nprocedure)\u2014which means that it is to some extent independent of\nthe agent\u2019s intentional control and previously acquired\nknowledge. (For more on originality and spontaneity, recall\n \u00a72.2\n above). Intuitively, the causes of something creative cannot simply\nbe a matter of copying or following a routine. But it may have causes\nnonetheless, and cognitive science can investigate those causes, at\nleast in principle. Indeed, as we\u2019ll see next, it is doing so in\npractice.\n",
