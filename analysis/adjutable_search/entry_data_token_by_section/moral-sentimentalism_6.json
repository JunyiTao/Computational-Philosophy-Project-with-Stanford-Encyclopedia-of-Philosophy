    "main_text": "Judgment Sentimentalism || Expressivism\n3.2 Expressivism\n\nThe above argument concerns moral judgment as a psychological state, a\nkind of thought. But the term \u2018judgment\u2019 is sometimes also\nused for linguistic utterances. Likewise, the term\n\u2018non-cognitivism\u2019 is also used for a thesis about moral\nlanguage. To minimize confusion, this entry will talk about moral\nterms, utterances, and sentences when it comes to linguistic entities,\nand reserve the term \u2018expressivism\u2019 for the linguistic\nthesis. Bearing these terminological stipulations in mind, any\nargument for non-cognitivism can be extended to an argument for\nexpressivism with the addition of some deceptively simple\npremises:\n\nThe meaning of a sentence is determined by the mental state it\nexpresses. (Metasemantic Psychologism)\nMoral sentences express moral judgments.\nSo, moral sentences express (at least in part) non-cognitive\npsychological states.\nSo, the meaning of moral sentences is determined (at least in\npart) by non-cognitive psychological states.\n\n\nPremise 4 is the key addition. It is not the only way to arrive at a\nbroadly expressivist theory in ethics \u2013 earlier forms, such as\nemotivism (Ayer 1936; Stevenson 1944) and universal prescriptivism\n(Hare 1952) relied on the problematic assumption that the meaning of a\nsentence is to be understood on the basis of the effects it is used to\nachieve or the speech act it is used to perform. Metasemantic\nPsychologism doesn\u2019t make this assumption, but simply derives\nthe meaning of linguistic expressions from the thoughts that they\nexpress, rather than their truth-conditions or the possible worlds\nthey rule out, as standard semantics does (Gibbard 1990: 92)\n\nIt is essential to understanding expressivism that expressing\na thought is not the same thing as reporting a thought\n\u2013 when I say \u201cThe sun is shining\u201d, I\nexpress my belief that the sun is shining, rather than\nreporting it, for which I\u2019d have to say \u201cI\nbelieve that the sun is shining.\u201d Mark Schroeder (2010) has\nrecently emphasized that the core expressivist claim is that the\nsentence \u201cMurder is wrong\u201d is related to disapproval of\nmurder in just the same way as the sentence \u201cThe sun is\nshining\u201d is related to the belief that the sun is shining,\nwhatever that is. The only difference is that the expressed state is\nnon-descriptive. This has significant semantic consequences, to be\nsure. Famously, since non-descriptive states lack truth-conditions,\n(pure) expressivists cannot explain the inferential relations among\nthem in the usual way, but rather in terms of agreement or\ndisagreement in attitudes (Stevenson 1937, Gibbard 2003). Attempts to\ndo so have proven controversial, to say the least. For discussion, see\nthe entry on\n Moral Cognitivism vs. Non-Cognitivism.\n\nAlthough it is definitive of expressivism that the meanings of moral\nsentences are explained without appealing to their truth-conditions,\nit is important to note that contemporary expressivists do not deny\nthat it makes sense to talk about moral truth or even moral facts. But\nfor them, doing so is just a different way of expressing first-order\nethical views. As Blackburn puts it:\n\n\nTo say that an ethical view is true is just to reaffirm it, and so it\nis if we add the weighty words \u2018really\u2019,\n\u2018true\u2019, \u2018fact\u2019, and so on. To say that it is\nobjectively true is to affirm that its truth does not vary with what\nwe happen to think about it, and once more this is an internal,\nfirst-order ethical position. (Blackburn 1998: 296)\n\n\nMaking sense of the action-guiding character of moral language is not,\nof course, the only motivation for expressivism. Another important\npart of the case for it is the Argument from Moral Supervenience,\noriginally made by Blackburn (1971; 1985), which claims, roughly, that\nexpressivists can best explain why it is a conceptual truth that\ndescriptively identical worlds must be morally identical.
