    "main_text": "Contemporary Compatibilism || Reasons-Responsive Compatibilism\n4.5 Strawsonian Compatibilism\n\nFinally, let\u2019s consider views inspired by Strawson\u2019s\ncompatibilism.\n\nSeveral contemporary philosophers have advanced Strawsonian themes.\nFor example, Gary Watson (1987) sought to elaborate these themes by\nthinking of our moral responsibility practices, and in particular the\nmorally reactive attitudes, along the lines of a communication-based\ntheory in which a morally responsible agent\u2019s competence turns\nin some way upon being a potential interlocutor to moral conversations\nbetween her and the moral community in which she operates. On this\nview, the control condition for moral responsibility would have to fit\nthe capacity to communicate morally through word and deed with members\nof the moral community.\n\nIn a somewhat different development of Strawson\u2019s thought, John\nMartin Fischer and Mark Ravizza hold that an account of guidance\ncontrol aids in providing the conditions of application for the\nconcept of moral responsibility, a concept that they maintain is\nStrawsonian (1998, pp.1\u201327). Fischer and Ravizza intend their\nStrawsonian theory as an amendment to Strawson\u2019s suggestion that\nmoral responsibility is to be associated with the reactions of those\nwithin the moral community to members of the community. They advise\nthat moral responsibility be developed by thinking in terms of the\npropriety conditions for the morally reactive attitudes. \n\nSusan Wolf defends (with significant reservations) the Strawsonian\nthesis that the interpersonal viewpoint (that permits access to the\nmorally reactive attitudes) is one that a freely willing agent cannot\ngive up (1981). Wolf diverges at points with Strawson\u2019s own\nmanner of defending this. But Wolf\u2019s central thesis is\nStrawsonian. A person cannot fully forswear the point of view of the\ninterpersonal attitudes, and this point of view is the point of view\nfrom whence our morally reactive attitudes gain their force and figure\nin our conduct. (Related defenses of the Strawsonian thesis are also\nfound in Shabo 2012 and Coates 2018.)\n\nPaul Russell (1995) has also defended a form of Strawsonian\ncompatibilism, the central features of which he finds anticipated in\nHume\u2019s writings on free will and moral responsibility. According\nto Russell, we can learn from Hume, as Strawson did, to understand our\nmoral responsibility practices as fundamentally a matter of our\nsentiments and our social expectations as structured and sustained by\nthese sentiments. Fixing on our moral natures, as we should, dispels\nany presumption that determinism would somehow pose a threat to our\nconceptions of freedom and moral responsibility.\n\nR. Jay Wallace (1994) offers an extension of Strawson\u2019s general\nstrategy in terms of moral norms of fairness for holding responsible\nreflected in our moral responsibility practices (1994,\npp.103\u20139). From these moral norms\u2014and not from the mere\nnaturalistic facts that we have these practices\u2014Wallace proceeds\nto uncover the conditions required for being responsible.\nWallace\u2019s position has emerged as a serious alternative to the\nsorts of approaches to the free will problem that take as their\ntheoretical starting point the nature of persons, or the\naction-theoretic characteristics of the process issuing in freely\nwilled action. \n\nAnd finally, perhaps the most detailed recent defense of Strawsonian\ncompatibilism is due to David Shoemaker (2017). Shoemaker argues for a\nresponse-dependent account of moral responsibility first by defending\na response-dependent account of amusement. He then argues the norms of\nhumor are tightly parallel to those of responsibility-entailing\nemotions like anger. And from there, he builds his response-dependent\naccount of moral responsibility.\n",
