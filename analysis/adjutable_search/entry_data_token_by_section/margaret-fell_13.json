Feroli (2006, 149\u201350) highlights the\nfact that Fell\u2019s arguments in favour of women\u2019s preaching\ndo not efface the significance of the female body. In Womens\nSpeaking Justified, Fell supports her case for female spiritual\nauthority by appealing to the Virgin Mary\u2019s vital role in\nsalvation history. By virtue of her maternal power, Fell emphasizes,\nMary gave birth to the \u201cSeed of the Woman\u201d: \u201cthe holy\nGhost came upon her, and the holy thing that was born of her, was\ncalled the Son of God\u201d, and Christ was \u201cmade\nof a woman\u201d (Fell 1667c, 12, 4). Here Fell upholds a\npositive conception of sexual difference, according to which the female\nbody is integral (rather than irrelevant) to the bringing of\nChrist\u2019s message. In addition, Fell also valorizes the women who\nspread the message of Christ\u2019s resurrection. These women exhibit\nadmirable character traits or virtues, such as love and\nloyalty to Christ: their hearts were \u201cunited and knit unto him in\nlove\u201d, and they \u201ccould not depart as the men did, but sat\nwatching and waiting, and weeping about the Sepulchre\u201d (7). The\nwoman who pours ointment on Christ\u2019s head also demonstrates that\nshe \u201cknew more of the secret Power and Wisdom of God, then his\nDisciples did\u201d (5). In such instances, women are not required to\ntranscend or efface their natural womanhood in order to be admirable,\nand they are not mere vessels for the message of Christ\u2014they have\ntheir virtues regardless, as natural women. Hence Feroli says that\nFell\u2019s text \u201cnot only affirms the theological point that\nwomen may speak in the church but also attempts to change general\nperceptions of women\u2019s abilities\u201d (Feroli 2006, 151). Her\ntext challenges negative stereotypes of women as mentally and morally\ninferior to men.\n\n\nMore generally, it might be noted that when the Quakers defend a\nwoman\u2019s right to speak with religious authority, they are also\n(implicitly, at least) defending a natural woman\u2019s ability to\nchoose freely to live in the light. In her millenarian \u201ccalls to\nthe Jews\u201d, For Manasseth Ben Israel and A Loving\nSalutation, Fell emphasizes that while the spirit of the Lord\nmight be divinely implanted, turning to the light requires a certain\ncapacity for discernment, a firm resolution of will, and a natural\nbravery and courage on the part of the individual. First,\n\u201chearkening diligently\u201d to the inner light requires the\nsubject actively to discern what is necessary for her salvation. An\nindividual must be capable of understanding or recognising what is her\ntrue good, such as \u201cEternall peace\u201d (Fell 1656c, 5) or the\ndivine \u201cInheritance\u201d (Fell 1656a, 8). Second, hearkening\nrequires that the subject show due attention to the voice of the Lord\nwithin, by an exercise of free will: the individual must will herself\nto \u201cturn\u201d her eyes or \u201cincline\u201d her ears (Fell\n1656a, 3). And third, hearkening requires strength of moral\ncharacter\u2014not only because the light reproaches the individual\nwith her own sin, but because turning to the light may require\ncontradicting one\u2019s spiritual teachers. \u00a0The light\n\u201clets you see the thoughts of your hearts, that they are vaine,\nwhich light lets you see when you doe amisse, when you tell a lye, when\nyou doe wrong to any man\u201d (Fell 1656a, 2). This knowledge will\n\u201crip you up and lay you open \u2026 and make all the deceit of\nyour heart appear\u201d (Fell 1656c, 7). The individual must be brave\nand steadfast to face up to such sinfulness. She must also reflect\ncritically on what she may have been taught to believe by family and\nfriends, especially those conventions concerning outward worship and\noutward appearances. In short, by affirming that women preachers can be\nin the light, Fell implicitly affirms that natural women are capable of\nasserting their intellect and will in order to attain salvation, even\nif that means defying their fathers, husbands, or other male spiritual\nguides.\n",
