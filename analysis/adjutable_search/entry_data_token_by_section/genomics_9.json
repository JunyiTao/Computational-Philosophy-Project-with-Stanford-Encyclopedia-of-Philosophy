    "main_text": "Beyond Sequencing || Metagenomics\n4. Outlook\n\nGenomics is now an integral part of all of the life sciences. Not that\nevery life scientist is now a genomicist\u2014there are still\nresearchers who focus on the biochemistry, development, or the\nmolecular networks of human cells and other organisms. But the DNA\nsequences of the human genome and the numerous model organisms that\ncame out of the HGP enter every laboratory, if not on a daily basis\nthan at least at some stage of every research project. The same\napplies to the maps of genetic variation that were discussed\nin Section 3 and to the (somewhat controversial)\ndata on functional DNA elements that the ENCODE project generated (see\nthe supplementary document\n The ENCODE Project and the ENCODE Controversy).\n\nAnd it is not just the quantity of data and the many new\n\u201c-omes\u201d that researchers now work with that have\ntransformed the science. As we have pointed out in several places,\ninsights into the genome and its functioning have transformed\nresearchers\u2019 understanding of the entities and processes they\nare working with in the course of the last few decades. Part of this\nwas also a transformation in our understanding of what it means to do\n\u2018good\u2019 science. What the HPG and its various offshoots\nhave achieved, therefore, is to change the life sciences at the\nepistemological, the ontological and also the methodological\nlevel.\n\nAs so often, an interesting and even pressing question is where all of\nthis is going. Predicting the future might not be possible, but there\nare trends that can be identified and which can be expected to follow\na similar trajectory in the near future. One such trend is the drive\nfor big data. \u2018Big\u2019 here refers not only to the quantity\nbut also to the different types of data collected. A derivative of\nthis big-data drive is the goal to integrate all of the diverse data\nand mould it into models that can further our understanding of\nbiological systems and the prediction of their behaviour. The\nrelatively young discipline of systems biology, which could not be\ndiscussed in detail in this entry, will certainly play a key role in\nthis endeavour.\n",
