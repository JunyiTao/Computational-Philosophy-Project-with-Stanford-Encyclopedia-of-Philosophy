    "main_text": "Scientific Realism and the Pessimistic Induction || The Divide et Impera Strategy\n2.5 The Divide et Impera Strategy\n\nIf we think of the pessimistic argument not as inductive but as a\nwarrant-remover argument and if we also think that the fate\nof (past) theories should have a bearing on what we are warranted in\naccepting now, we should think of its structure differently. It has\nbeen argued by Psillos (1999: chapter 5) that we should think of the\npessimistic argument as a kind of reductio. Argument (L)\nabove aimed to \u201cdiscredit the claim that there is an explanatory\nconnection between empirical success and truth-likeness\u201d which\nwould warrant the realist view that current successful theories are\ntruthlike. If we view the historical challenge this way, viz., as a\npotential warrant-remover argument, the past record of science does\nplay a role in it, since it is meant to offer this\nwarrant-remover.\n\nPsillos\u2019s (1996) reconstruction of Laudan\u2019s argument was\nas follows:\n\n\nArgument (P):\n\n(A) Currently successful theories are truthlike.\n\n(B) If currently successful theories are truthlike, then past theories\nare not.\n\n(C) These characteristically false past theories were, nonetheless,\nempirically successful. (The \u2018historical gambit\u2019)\n\nHence, empirical success is not connected with truthlikeness and\ntruthlikeness cannot explain success: the realist\u2019s potential\nwarrant for (A) is defeated.\n\n\nPremise (B) of argument (P) is critical. It is meant to capture\nradical discontinuity in theory-change, which was put thus (stated in\nthe material mode):\n\n\nPast theories are deemed not to have been truth-like because the\nentities they posited are no longer believed to exist and/or because\nthe laws and mechanisms they postulated are not part of our current\ntheoretical description of the world. (Psillos 1999: 97).\n\n\nIn this setting, the \u2018historical gambit\u2019 (C) makes perfect\nsense. Unless there are past successful theories which are\nwarrantedly deemed not to be truthlike, premise (B) cannot be\nsustained and the warrant-removing reductio of (A) fails. If (C) can\nbe substantiated, success cannot be used to warrant the claim that\ncurrent theories are true. The realists\u2019 explanatory link\nbetween truthlikeness and empirical success is undercut. (C) can be\nsubstantiated only by examining past successful theories and their\nfate. History of science is thereby essentially engaged.\n\nThe realist response has come to be known as the divide et\nimpera strategy to refute the pessimistic argument. The focus of\nthis strategy was on rebutting the claim that the truth of current\ntheories implies that past theories cannot be deemed truthlike. To\ndefend realism, realists needed to be selective in their commitments.\nThis selectivity was developed by Kitcher (1993) and (independently)\nby Psillos (1994).\n\nOne way to be selective is to draw a distinction between working\nposits of a theory (viz., those theoretical posits that occur\nsubstantially in the explanatory schemata of the theory) and\npresuppositional posits (putative entities that apparently\nhave to exist if the instances of the explanatory schemata of the\ntheory are to be true) (cf. Kitcher 1993: 149). Another way is to draw\na distinction between the theoretical claims that essentially or\nineliminably contribute to the generation of successes of a theory and\nthose claims that are \u2018idle\u2019 components that have had no\ncontribution to the theory\u2019s success (cf. Psillos 1994, 1996).\nThe underlying thought is that the empirical successes of a theory do\nnot indiscriminably support all theoretical claims of the theory, but\nrather the empirical support is differentially distributed among the\nvarious claims of the theory according to the contribution they make\nto the generation of the successes. Generally, Kitcher (1993) and\nPsillos (1996, 1999) have argued that there are ways to distinguish\nbetween the \u2018good\u2019 and the \u2018bad\u2019\nparts of past abandoned theories and to show that the\n\u2018good\u2019 parts\u2014those that enjoyed evidential support,\nwere not idle components and the like\u2014were retained in\nsubsequent theories.\n\nIt is worth-noting that, methodologically, the divide et\nimpera strategy recommended that the historical challenge to\nrealism can only be met by looking at the actual successes of past\nsuccessful theories and by showing that those parts of past theories\n(e.g., the caloric theory of heat or the optical ether theories) that\nwere fuelling theory successes were retained in subsequent theories\nand those theoretical terms which were central in the relevant past\ntheories were referential. In fact, Vickers has recently made the\nmethodological suggestion that if one\u2019s sole aim is to\ncope with a historical challenge, then it is sufficient that one shows\nthat the abandoned hypotheses were not essential for the\nrelevant theory\u2019s empirical success, without at the same time\ntaking side on which are the essential theoretical\nhypotheses. As Vickers claims, in order to respond to a PI-style\nchallenge, \u201call the realist needs to do is show that the\nspecific assumptions identified by the antirealist do not\nmerit realist commitment. And she can do this without saying anything\nabout how to identify the posits which do merit realist\ncommitment\u201d (2017: 3224). Besides, according to Vickers\u2019s\nconception of the dialectic of the PI-debate, the onus of proof lies\nwith the antirealist: the antirealist has to reconstruct the\nderivation of a prediction, identify the assumptions that merit\nrealist commitments and then show that at least one of them is not\ntruthlike by our current lights; and then all the realists need to\nshow is that the specific assumptions were inessential. In sum,\nVickers argues that \u201cthe project of responding to the historical\nchallenge\u201d and \u201cthe project of explaining what realists\nshould commit to\u201d have to be kept distinct (2017: 3222). \n\nAt any rate, either employed in the identification of the trustworthy\ntheoretical parts or in the (mere) handling of a historical challenge,\nthe divide et impera move suggests that there has been enough\ntheoretical continuity in theory-change to warrant the realist claim\nthat science is \u2018on the right track.\n",
