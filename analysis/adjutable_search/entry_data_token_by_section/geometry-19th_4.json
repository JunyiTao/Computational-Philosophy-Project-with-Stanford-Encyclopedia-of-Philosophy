The differential geometry of Riemann\n\n\nIn a lecture \u201cOn the hypotheses that lie at the foundation of\ngeometry\u201d, delivered to the Faculty of Philosophy at G\u00f6ttingen in\n1854 and posthumously published in 1867, Bernhard Riemann\n(b.\u00a01826, d.\u00a01866) presented some radically innovative views\non this matter. He noted that the measurable properties of a discrete\nmanifold can be readily determined by counting. (Think of the\npopulation of a country, and the proportion of born-again Christians,\nor of couples who divorced within the first year of their marriage.)\nBut continuous manifolds do not admit this approach. In particular, the\nmeasurable properties of physical space, which are the subject of\ngeometry, depend on the binding forces that act on it. The distance\nbetween two points in space can be ascertained with a rod, or a tape,\nor by optical means, and the result depends essentially on the physical\nbehavior of the instruments used. Up to now, the measurable properties\nof space have been successfully described in accordance with Euclidean\ngeometry. However, \u201cthe empirical concepts on which the metric\ndeterminations of space are based\u2014the concepts of a rigid body\nand a light ray\u2014lose their validity in the infinitely small; it\nis therefore quite likely that the metric relations of space in the\ninfinitely small do not agree with the assumptions of geometry, and in\nfact one would have to accept this as soon as the phenomena can thereby\nbe explained in a simpler way\u201d (Riemann 1854, p. 149). To prepare\nphysicists for this eventuality, Riemann proposed a more general\nconception of geometry. Riemann's basic scheme makes allowance for much\ngreater generality than he actually reaches for; but, in his judgment,\nit should be enough for the time being to characterize the geometry of\ncontinuous manifolds in such a way that it agrees optimally with\nEuclidean geometry on a small neighborhood of each point. \n\n\nRiemann extends to n dimensions the methods employed by Gauss\n(1828) in his study of the intrinsic geometry of curved surfaces\nembedded in Euclidean space (called \u2018intrinsic\u2019 because it\ndescribes the metric properties that the surfaces display by\nthemselves, independently of the way they lie in space). Looking back\nat Gauss's work one gets a better intuitive feel for Riemann's\nconcepts (see Torretti 1978, pp. 68\u201382). However, for the sake of\nconciseness and perspicuity, it is advisable to look forward and to\navail oneself of certain concepts introduced by later mathematicians\nas they tried to make sense of Riemann's proposal. Consider the modern\nformulation of Riemann's theory in the supplement\n A Modern Formulation of Riemann's Theory.\n\n\nIn his study of curved surfaces, Gauss introduced a real-valued\nfunction, the Gaussian curvature, which measures a surface's\nlocal deviation from flatness in terms of the surface's intrinsic\ngeometry. Riemann extended this concept of curvature to Riemannian\nn-manifolds. By using his extended concept of curvature, he was able to\ncharacterize with great elegance the metric manifolds in which all\nfigures can freely move around without changing their size and shape.\nThey are the Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature. This\nidea can be nicely combined with Klein's classification of metric\ngeometries. Regarded as Riemannian 3-manifolds, Euclidean space has\nconstant zero curvature, Lobachevskian space has constant negative\ncurvature, and elliptic space has constant positive curvature. Pursuant\nto the Erlangen Program, each of these geometries of constant curvature\nis characterized by its own group of isometries. But Klein's conception\nis too narrow to embrace all Riemannian geometries, which include\nspaces of variable curvature. Indeed, in the general case, the group of\nisometries of a Riemannian n-manifold is the trivial group consisting\nof the identity alone, whose structure conveys no information at all\nabout the respective geometry.\n",
