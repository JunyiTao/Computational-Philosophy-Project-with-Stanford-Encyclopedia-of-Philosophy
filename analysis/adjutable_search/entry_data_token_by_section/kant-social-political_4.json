    "main_text": "Rebellion and Revolution\n6. Rebellion and Revolution\n\nThe very idea of a right to rebel against the government is\nincoherent, Kant argued, because the embodiment of all right is the\nactually existing state. By this he did not mean that any actually\nexisting state is always completely just, or that merely by virtue of\nhaving power, the state could determine what justice is. He meant that\na rightful condition, the opposite of the state of nature, is possible\nonly when there is some means for individuals to be governed by the\n\u201cgeneral legislative will\u201d (6:320). Any state embodies the\ngeneral legislative will better than no state. While such reasoning\nseems pragmatic, it is not. It is instead based upon the claims above\nthat a rightful condition requires the centralizing of coercive power\nin a state as the only means of bringing about reciprocal coercion,\nobligation, and objective settlement of disputes. Kant also argues\nthat a right to rebel would require that a people be authorized to\nresist the state. This kind of authorization for action, however, is\nan exercise of sovereign power, and any people who claimed such a\nright would be claiming that it (the people) rather than the state\nembodies sovereign power. It would thus \u201cmake the people, as\nsubject, by one and the same judgment sovereign over him to whom it is\nsubject\u201d (6:320). This is a contradiction. The nature of\nsovereignty is such that sovereign power cannot be shared. Were it\nshared between the state and the people, then when a dispute arose\nbetween them, who would judge whether the state or the people are\ncorrect? There being no higher sovereign power to make such a\njudgment, all other means for resolving the dispute fall outside of\nrightful relations. This role of judgment relates to the judgment that\nKant discusses with regard to the social contract. Under the idea of a\nsocial contract, the sovereign legislator may not make a law that the\npeople could not make for itself because it possesses irrational,\nnon-universal form. The state, not the people, is the judge of when a\nlaw is rational (8:297). People who argue for a right to revolution,\nKant claims, misunderstand the nature of a social contract. They claim\nthat the social contract must have been an actual historical\noccurrence from which the people could withdraw (8:301\u201302). But\nsince the social contact is only an idea of reason which sets moral\nlimits to the sovereign\u2019s legislative acts, and the\nsovereign\u2019s judgment alone determines how these limits are to be\ninterpreted, there is no independent contractual agreement to which\nthe people could refer in its complaints. Citizens are still allowed\nto voice their grievances through their use of public reason, but they\ncan do nothing more than attempt to persuade the sovereign to adopt or\nrepeal decisions.\n\nWhile the people cannot rebel against the state, Kant does not insist\nthat citizens always obey the state. He allows at least for passive\ncivil disobedience. This comes in two forms: in a republican\nrepresentative system such as England\u2019s, there can be \u201ca\nnegative resistance, that is, a refusal of the people (in parliament)\nto accede to every demand the government puts forth as necessary for\nadministering the state\u201d (6:322). In the context of this\ndiscussion it is clear that Kant is referring to the use of the power\nof the legislature to refuse funding, and therefore approval, of\nactions of the executive. He clarifies that the legislature is not\nallowed to dictate any positive action to the executive, its\nlegitimate resistance is only negative. A second form of acceptable\nresistance applies to individuals. Kant mentions that citizens are\nobligated to obey the sovereign \u201cin whatever does not conflict\nwith inner morality\u201d (6:371). He does not elaborate on the term\n\u201cinner morality\u201d.\n\nNor does Kant always reject the actions of revolutionaries. If a\nrevolution is successful, citizens have as much obligation to obey the\nnew regime as they had to obey the old one (6:323). Since the new\nregime is in fact a state authority, it now possesses the right to\nrule. Further, in his theory of history, Kant argues that progress in\nthe long run will come about in part through violent and unjust\nactions such as wars. Kant even takes it as a sign of progress that\nspectators of the French Revolution had greeted it with \u201ca\nwishful participation that borders closely on enthusiasm\u201d\n(7:85). Kant is not pointing to the revolution itself as a sign of\nprogress but to the reaction of people such as himself to news of the\nrevolution. The spectators endorse the revolution not because it is\nlegitimate but because it is aimed at the creation of a civil\nconstitution. Revolution, then, is wrong but still contributes to\nprogress.\n\nIn fact, Kant did believe that the French Revolution was legitimate,\nat least in its earliest stages, and a look at his argument\nilluminates some of his complex terminology. The French king possessed\nsovereignty until he convened the Estates General as representative of\nthe people, at which time sovereignty \u201cpassed to the\npeople\u201d even though the king had intended for the assembly to\nresolve specific problems and then return the reins of power to him\n(6:341\u20132). Further, the king could not have any power to\nrestrain the actions of the assembly as a condition for it being given\nthe sovereign power, for there can be no restrictions on this\nsovereign power. This understanding of sovereignty shows the\ndifference between a rebellion against authority and peaceful transfer\nof sovereign power such as an election. In an election, sovereignty is\npassed back to the people, so there is nothing wrong with the people\nreplacing the entire government. Without an election (or similar\nmethod of designating the return of sovereignty to the people), any\naction aimed at replacing the government is wrong.\n",
