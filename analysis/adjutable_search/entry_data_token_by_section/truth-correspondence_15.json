    "main_text": "The Correspondence Theory and Its Competitors || The Identity Theory of Truth\n8.3 The Identity Theory of Truth\n\n\nAccording to the identity theory of truth, true propositions\ndo not correspond to facts, they are facts: the true\nproposition that snow is white = the fact that snow is white. This\nnon-traditional competitor of the correspondence theory threatens to\ncollapse the correspondence relation into identity. (See Moore\n1901-02; and Dodd 2000 for a book-length defense of this theory and\ndiscussion contrasting it with the correspondence theory; and see the\nentry\n the identity theory of truth:  \n in this encyclopedia.)\n\n\nIn response, a correspondence theorist will point out: (a)\nThe identity theory is defensible only for propositions as\ntruthbearers, and only for propositions construed in a certain way,\nnamely as having objects and properties as constituents rather than\nideas or concepts of objects and properties; that is, for Russellian\npropositions. Hence, there will be ample room (and need) for\ncorrespondence accounts of truth for other types of truthbearers,\nincluding propositions, if they are construed as constituted, partly\nor wholly, of concepts of objects and\nproperties. (b) The identity theory is committed to the\nunacceptable consequence that facts are true. (c) The\nidentity theory rests on the assumption that that-clauses always\ndenote propositions, so that the that-clause in \u201cthe fact that\nsnow is white\u201d denotes the proposition that snow is white. The\nassumption can be questioned. That-clauses can be understood as\nambiguous names, sometimes denoting propositions and sometimes\ndenoting facts. The descriptive phrases \u201cthe\nproposition\u2026\u201d and \u201cthe fact\u2026\u201d can be\nregarded as serving to disambiguate the succeeding ambiguous\nthat-clauses\u2014much like the descriptive phrases in \u201cthe\nphilosopher Socrates\u201d and \u201cthe soccer-player\nSocrates\u201d serve to disambiguate the ambiguous name\n\u201cSocrates\u201d (cf. David 2002).\n",
