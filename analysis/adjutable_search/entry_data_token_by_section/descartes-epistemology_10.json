    "main_text": "The Cogito and Doubt || Does the Cogito count as (Atheist-Available) Perfect Knowledge?\n4.2 Does the Cogito count as (Atheist-Available) Perfect Knowledge?\n\nThe extraordinary certainty and doubt-resistance of the\ncogito marks an Archimedean turning point in the\nmeditator\u2019s inquiry. However, there are interpretive disputes\nabout whether Descartes intends the cogito to count \u2013\nat its initial introduction, prior to the arguments for God \u2013 as\nfully indubitable, and therefore as perfect knowledge. It is\nquite common to interpret the cogito as being the first item\nof perfect knowledge. In\n Section 6.1\n we\u2019ll explore how such interpretations (i.e., Bounded Doubt\nInterpretations) render Descartes\u2019 broader argument. But here,\nI want to develop the textual case for holding that even the \ncogito is undermined by Evil Genius Doubt.\n\nThere is no disputing that Descartes characterizes the cogito\nas the \u201cfirst item of knowledge [cognitione]\u201d\n(Med. 3, AT 7:35, CSM 2:24), and as the first \u201cpiece of\nknowledge [cognitio]\u201d (Prin. 1:7, AT 8a:7, CSM\n1:195). Noteworthy, however, is the Latin terminology Descartes uses\nin these characterizations (\u2018cognitio\u2019 and its\ncognates). As noted at the outset, Descartes is a contextualist in the\nsense of invoking the notion of knowledge in divergent\ncontexts that presuppose very different epistemic standards. Of\nparticular interest is that he expressly clarifies that contexts aptly\ncharacterized in terms of cognitio-talk do not necessarily\ncount as perfect knowledge:\n\nThe fact that an atheist can be \u201cclearly aware [clare\ncognoscere] that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two\nright angles\u201d is something I do not dispute. But I maintain that\nthis awareness [cognitionem] of his is not true knowledge\n[scientiam], since no act of awareness [cognitio]\nthat can be rendered doubtful seems fit to be called knowledge\n[scientia]. Now since we are supposing that this individual\nis an atheist, he cannot be certain that he is not being deceived on\nmatters which seem to him to be very evident (as I fully explained).\n(Replies 2, AT 7:141, CSM 2:101)\n\n\nThis alone does not prove that the cogito is not intended\nto count as perfect knowledge (at its initial occurrence, in the\nSecond Meditation). However, it does undercut the argument\nwhereby calling it the \u201cfirst item of knowledge\u201d\nshows that Descartes intends it as perfect knowledge.\n\nMore generally, a wide range of clear texts support (what I\u2019ll\ncall) the No Atheistic Perfect Knowledge Thesis \u2013 a thesis with\nimplications for the debate about the cogito. Consider the\nfollowing texts, each arising in a context of clarifying the\nrequirements of perfect knowledge (italics are added):\n\n\nFor if I do not know this [i.e., \u201cwhether there is a God, and,\nif there is, whether he can be a deceiver\u201d], it seems that I can\nnever be quite certain about anything else. (Med. 3, AT 7:36,\nCSM 2:25)\n\nI see that the certainty of all other things depends on this\n[i.e., \u201cthat the supreme being exists\u201d], so that without\nit nothing can ever be perfectly known [perfecte\nsciri]. (Med. 5, AT 7:69, CSM 2:48)\n\n[I]f I were unaware of God \u2026 I should thus never have true and\ncertain knowledge [scientiam] about anything, but\nonly shifting and changeable opinions. (Med. 5, AT 7:69, CSM 2:48)\n\nThus I see plainly that the certainty and truth of all\nknowledge [scientiae] depends uniquely on my awareness of the\ntrue God, to such an extent that I was incapable of perfect knowledge\n[perfecte scire] about anything else until I became\naware of him. (Med. 5, AT 7:71, CSM 2:49)\n\n\nThese texts make a powerful case that nothing else can be\nperfectly known prior to establishing that we\u2019re\ncreated by an all-perfect God, rather than an evil genius. Indeed,\nDescartes\u2019 express wording seems intended to rule-out any \nexceptions. The first text is particularly noteworthy, because it\ncomes at the end of a paragraph which includes reference to the \ncogito. As Curley writes:\n\nNotice that Descartes does not say: until I know whether God\nexists and can be a deceiver I cannot be certain of anything\nexcept the existence of the self and its thoughts. He says he\ncannot be certain of anything. (2006, 40)\n\n\nDescartes looks to hold that hyperbolic doubt is utterly unbounded\n\u2013 i.e., that it undermines all manner of propositions,\nincluding thereby the proposition that \u201cI exist.\u201d\n\nWe can indeed read the opening paragraphs of the Third Meditation as\nintended to clarify not that the cogito is perfectly known,\nbut instead the following twofold point: First, that what underwrites\nthe cogito\u2019s epistemic impressiveness is\nclarity and distinctness. Second, that even\ncognitions this impressive can be undermined by Evil Genius Doubt, and\nthus lack the full indubitability of perfect knowledge.\n\nRegarding the first point, the Third Meditation opens with meditator\nattempting to build on the apparent success of the cogito.\nWhat are the internal marks of this impressive perception \u2013\nwhat is it like to have perception that good? The answer:\n\nI am certain that I am a thinking thing. Do I not therefore also know\nwhat is required for my being certain about anything? In this first\nitem of knowledge [cognitione] there is simply a clear and\ndistinct perception of what I am asserting. (AT 7:35, CSM 2:24)\n\n\nThe next two paragraphs help clarify (among other things) what\nDescartes takes to be epistemically impressive about clear and\ndistinct perception, in contrast with external sense perception.\nOf external sensation, the third paragraph offers this:\n\nYet I previously accepted as wholly certain and evident many things\nwhich I afterwards realized were doubtful. What were these? The earth,\nsky, stars, and everything else that I apprehended with the senses.\nBut what was it about them that I perceived clearly? Just that the\nideas, or thoughts, of such things appeared before my mind. Yet even\nnow I am not denying that these ideas occur within me. \u2026 Here\nwas my mistake; or at any rate, if my judgement was true, it was not\nthanks to the strength of my perception. (AT 7:35, CSM 2:24f)\n\n\nThough we regularly form judgments based on external sensation, they\nare easily undermined by sceptical doubt, as shown by the Now Dreaming\nDoubt. By contrast, our clear and distinct perceptions enjoy a\nperceptual \u201cstrength\u201d enabling us to ward off even the\nEvil Genius Doubt (at least, so it might seem). The fourth paragraph\noffers this:\n\nBut what about when I was considering something very simple and\nstraightforward in arithmetic or geometry, for example that two and\nthree added together make five, and so on? Did I not see at least\nthese things clearly enough to affirm their truth? \u2026 when I\nturn to the things themselves which I think I perceive very clearly, I\nam so convinced by them that I spontaneously declare: let whoever can\ndo so deceive me, he will never bring it about that I am nothing, so\nlong as I continue to think I am something \u2026 or bring it about\nthat two and three added together are more or less than five, or\nanything of this kind in which I see a manifest contradiction. (AT\n7:36, CSM 2:25)\n\n\nPrima facie, this excerpt suggests that multiple propositions are\n\u2013 at this pre-theistic stage of the broader argument \u2013\nfully indubitable, thereby counting as perfect knowledge. But there\nis more to the paragraph; which brings us to the second point noted \nabove, namely, that even cognitions this impressive can be undermined \nby Evil Genius Doubt \u2013 an outcome clarified in the final lines\nof this same paragraph:\n\nFor if I do not know this [i.e., \u201cwhether there is a God, and,\nif there is, whether he can be a deceiver\u201d], it seems that I can\nnever be quite certain about anything else.\n\n\nIn order to appreciate the subtleties of this pivotal fourth paragraph\nof the Third Meditation, we need to clarify the indirect\nmanner in which Evil Genius Doubt operates on clear and distinct\nperception.\n",
