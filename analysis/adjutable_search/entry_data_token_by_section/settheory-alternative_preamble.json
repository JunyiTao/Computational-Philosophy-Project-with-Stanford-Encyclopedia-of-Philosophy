    "main_text": "\n\nBy \u201calternative set theories\u201d we mean systems of set\ntheory differing significantly from the dominant ZF\n(Zermelo-Frankel set theory) and its close relatives (though we will\nreview these systems in the article). Among the systems we will review\nare typed theories of sets, Zermelo set theory and its variations, New\nFoundations and related systems, positive set theories, and\nconstructive set theories. An interest in the range of alternative set\ntheories does not presuppose an interest in replacing the dominant set\ntheory with one of the alternatives; acquainting ourselves with\nfoundations of mathematics formulated in terms of an alternative\nsystem can be instructive as showing us what any set theory (including\nthe usual one) is supposed to do for us. The study of alternative set\ntheories can dispel a facile identification of \u201cset\ntheory\u201d with \u201cZermelo-Fraenkel set theory\u201d; they are\nnot the same thing.\n",
