    "main_text": "Alternative Frameworks || Traditional healing practices\n5.1 Traditional healing practices\n\n\u201cComplementary, alternative, or integrative medicine\u201d is\nbiomedicine\u2019s \u2018big tent\u2019 category for non-biomedical\nsystems of health care (see NCCIH in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Philosophers have pointed out that biomedicine, specifically\nevidence-based medicine, puts advocates of such non-biomedical systems\ninto a no-win position. One such philosophical challenge is that some\nof the claims made by non-biomedical systems are claimed to be\nnon-measurable experiences, e.g., the experience of Qi life\nforce in traditional Chinese Medicine (Tonelli & Callahan 2001).\nThis means that advocates have to either submit to the epistemological\nframework of biomedicine (which may be incapable of assessing some of\nthe effects claimed to exist), or refusing to play by medicine\u2019s\nrules and hence being dismissed by as quackery by biomedicine.\nEpistemically, it seems like the latter option is the better option,\nbut it would require advocates to \u201cwork to develop new research\ndesigns and new standards of evidence that reflect their approach to\nmedical care\u201d (Borgerson 2005: 502).\n\nClassical Chinese Medicine (CCM) remains practiced in communities\naround the world, and Lee draws out two core philosophical differences\nbetween CCM and biomedicine. First, CCM has \n\n\na process ontology\u2014it considers causal relationships between\nevents and processes to be foundational, rather than things.\nFurthermore, it implies complex causal relationships between events\nand processes which may be said to be multi-factorial and non-linear.\n(Lee 2017: 2) \n\n\nSecond, it is holistic \n\n\nthe universe and everything in it, including human beings, constitute\nwholes which are different from the sum of their parts, and which in\nturn are related and as well as inter-related with other wholes. (Lee\n2017: 2) \n\n\nIt is within this philosophical system that treatments such as\nacupuncture and herbal/dietary remedies are used. While the gulf\nbetween biomedicine and CCM is wide, it is not entirely dissimilar\nfrom some Western scientific practices: CCM\u2019s approach to health\nand the human body bear some resemblances to the ways that\nepidemiologists approach populations\u2019 health and how ecologists\napproach ecosystems. Among other similarities, in both fields there is\ngreat respect for balance and dynamic interconnected processes (Lee\nforthcoming).\n\nAyurvedic medicine takes a somewhat similarly holistic and\nbalance-oriented approach to the person and their health (Rastogi,\n2014) (note also that holistic bodily balance is central to the\nHippocractic medicine described in\n Section 1.2).\n One way that manifests in Ayurvedic practice\u2014in contrast with\nbiomedicine\u2014is that the biological characteristics of two\nindividuals might be similar but their recommended treatments might be\nquite different. For instance, while biomedicine routinely hands out\nstandardized advice on what sorts of foods are best for someone of a\ngiven age and sex, Ayurvedic medicine rejects the assumption that such\nstandardization within a single age-sex grouping is even a good\ndefault. Other factors play larger roles than in biomedicine,\nincluding bodily changes over the course of the day and one\u2019s\n(internal) body type (affecting how one metabolizes specific foods,\netc.). Complicating matters is that Ayurvedic medicine grew as a part\nof Hinduism in South Asia, and Hinduism itself is a substantially\nheterogeneous family of beliefs/practices that vary between\ncommunities (Desai 1988).\n",
