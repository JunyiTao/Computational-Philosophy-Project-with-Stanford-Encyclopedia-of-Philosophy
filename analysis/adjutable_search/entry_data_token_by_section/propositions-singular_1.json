    "main_text": "Reasons for Singular Propositions: The modal argument\n2. Reasons for Singular Propositions: The modal argument\n The first argument in favor of singular propositions we shall\nexamine is based on Saul Kripke's modal argument in\n(1970/1980). Kripke presented the argument as an argument that proper\nnames like \u2018Nixon\u2019 are not synonymous with ordinary\ndefinite descriptions like \u2018the first US president from\nCalifornia\u2019, rather than an argument for singular propositions,\nthe existence of which he never endorsed in print. David Kaplan, in\n(1977/1989, 512\u201313), however, used the argument to conclude that\ndemonstratives are directly referential expressions and hence express\nsingular propositions. The argument can be presented as follows. \n\n Suppose that David is standing at a table with Charles to his immediate\nleft and Paul to his immediate right. Paul lives in New Jersey and Charles lives\nin Illinois. David points to the person on his right and utters\nsentence (1) below at time t.\n(1) He lives in New Jersey.\n\nDavid has said something about Paul. Call the proposition David has\nexpressed p. p is distinct from the\npropositions expressed by the following sentences.\n\n (2) The person on David's immediate right (at t) lives in\nNew Jersey. \n (3) The person David demonstrated (at t) lives in New Jersey.\n\nBoth of the latter propositions are about Paul indirectly, in virtue\nof the properties he contingently has (namely, being to David's right\nat t and being demonstrated at t by David,\nrespectively). Now consider a counterfactual circumstance in which\nPaul and Charles have switched places but in which everything else\nabout them remained the same, consistent with this switch, and, in\nparticular, in which Paul still lived in New Jersey and Charles in\nIllinois. p is true at this circumstance, as Paul\nlives in New Jersey, while the propositions expressed by (2) and (3)\nare false at this circumstance, as Charles is both to David's right\nand demonstrated by David and he doesn't live in New Jersey. So,\np is distinct from the propositions expressed by (2)\nand (3).\n\n\nIt is important to be clear that we are concerned with the truth\nvalues of the propositions expressed by (1)-(3) at a described\ncounterfactual situation, not what propositions those sentences would\nhave expressed in those circumstances. (1) would have expressed a\ndifferent proposition, a proposition about Charles and so false, were\nDavid to have uttered it in the described situation. But our claim is\nthat the proposition expressed by David's actual utterance of (1) is\ntrue at the described counterfactual circumstance, while the\npropositions (actually) expressed by (2) and (3) are false at that\ncircumstance.\n\n Since p differs in truth value in the described\ncounterfactual circumstance from the propositions expressed by (2) and\n(3), it follows that p is distinct from the\npropositions expressed by (2) and (3). This is because, as\npropositions are the objects that are true or false in counterfactual\ncircumstances, if p =\np*, then p and p*\nhave the same truth value in all counterfactual circumstances. These\nconsiderations suggest that the proposition expressed by David's\nutterance of (1) is about Paul directly and hence that\np is a singular proposition. Any\nproposition that is about Paul indirectly, in virtue of qualities that\nhe contingently instantiates, will be subject to a similar argument.\n\n\nThere are two main responses to the modal argument in the\nliterature. The first involves a denial of the principle that, if\np = p*, then p and\np* have the same truth value in all counterfactual\ncircumstances. Michael Dummett (1991) and Jason Stanley (1997a/b;\n2002) have developed this response by denying that propositions are\nthe bearers of modal properties. Dummett distinguishes senses from\nwhat he calls ingredient senses. Senses give the contents of\nexpressions, are the bearers of truth and falsity, and are the objects\nof the attitudes. Ingredient senses, on the other hand, are the\nbearers of modal properties like being necessarily or contingently\ntrue or false and being true or false at a world. Because propositions\nare not the bearers of modal properties, Dummett and Stanley can\naccept that (1) is true with respect to our counterfactual situation\nwhile (2) and (3) are false even though the proposition expressed by\n(1) is the same as the proposition expressed by either (2) or (3). (It\nmay be possible to get the same results without denying that\npropositions are the bearers of modal properties by offering a\nnonstandard semantics of modal adverbs like \u2018necessarily\u2019\nand \u2018contingently\u2019 according to which they ascribe\nproperties \u2014 the property of being true in every/some world, say\n\u2014 to propositions but are sensitive to more than just the\nproposition they operate on. One model for this is the way\n\u2018so-called\u2019 functions in a sentence like \u2018Superman\nis so-called for his super powers\u2019. To our knowledge such a\ntheory has yet to be worked out in detail, but we have no doubt that\nit could be.)\n\n\nThe second response involves moving from contingent properties like\nthose involved in (2) and (3) to necessary properties, and in\nparticular to what, following Plantinga in (1974), we will call an\nindividual essence, which is a property that, necessarily, if\nx exists, then it has that property and, necessarily, only\nx has. The property being on David's right is not an\nindividual essence of Paul, as Paul might have existed without having\nhad it and Charles might have had it instead. But it is easy to turn\nsuch contingent properties into necessary ones by\nrigidifiying them. Paul necessarily has the property of\nactually being on David's right. For any world\nw, Paul has that rigidified property in\nw just in case in the actual world Paul has the\n(contingent) property of being on David's right. And, if Paul is the\nonly person to have that property in the actual world, then the\nrigidified property is not only a necessary property of Paul but also\nan individual essence of Paul. Such a property \u201ctracks\u201d\nPaul across every possible world. Consider then the propositions\nexpressed by (4) and (5).\n\n (4) The person actually on David's immediate right (at\n t) lives in New Jersey.  (5) The person\n actually David demonstrated (at t) lives in New\n Jersey.\n \n\n As far as the modal argument goes, these propositions can be\nidentified with p, as, for every world\nw, they have exactly the same truth value at\nw as p intuitively has at w.\n\n We do not claim that either response is ultimately\nsatisfying. Indeed, we are satisfied by neither. But their presence\ndoes show that the modal argument fails to bring out the real\ndifficulties with descriptivism and the fundamental need for singular\npropositions.\n",
