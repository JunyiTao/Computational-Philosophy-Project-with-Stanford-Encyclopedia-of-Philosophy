Many explicit characterizations in the\nliterature follow this model. Let us review some of the options.\n3.5.1 The Combined Criterion of Non-Mental and Non-Sensible\n\nAccording to the account implicit in Frege\u2019s writings:\n\nAn object is abstract if and only if it is both non-mental and\nnon-sensible.\n\nHere the first challenge is to say what it means for a thing to be\n\u2018non-mental\u2019, or as we more commonly say,\n\u2018mind-independent\u2019. The simplest approach is to say that a\nthing depends on the mind when it would not (or could not) have\nexisted if minds had not existed. But this entails that tables and\nchairs are mind-dependent, and that is not what philosophers who\nemploy this notion have in mind. To call an object\n\u2018mind-dependent\u2019 in a metaphysical context is to suggest\nthat it somehow owes its existence to mental activity, but not in the\nboring \u2018causal\u2019 sense in which ordinary artifacts owe\ntheir existence to the mind. What can this mean? One promising\napproach is to say that an object should be reckoned mind-dependent\nwhen, by its very nature, it exists at a time if and only if\nit is the object or content of some mental state or process at\nthat time. This counts tables and chairs as mind-independent,\nsince they might survive the annihilation of thinking things. But it\ncounts paradigmatically mental items, like a purple afterimage of\nwhich a person \\(X\\) may become aware, as mind-dependent, since it\npresumably lies in the nature of such items to be objects of conscious\nawareness whenever they exist. However, it is not clear that this\naccount captures the full force of the intended notion. Consider, for\nexample, the mereological fusion of \\(X\\)\u2019s afterimage and\n\\(Y\\)\u2019s headache. This is surely a mental entity if anything is.\nBut it is not necessarily the object of a mental state. (The fusion\ncan exist even if no one is thinking about it.) A more\ngenerous conception would allow for mind-dependent objects that exist\nat a time in virtue of mental activity at that time, even if the\nobject is not the object of any single mental state or act. The fusion\nof \\(X\\)\u2019s afterimage and \\(Y\\)\u2019s headache is\nmind-dependent in the second sense but not the first. That is a reason\nto prefer the second account of mind-dependence.\n\nIf we understand the notion of mind-dependence in this way, it is a\nmistake to insist that abstract objects be mind-independent. To strike\na theme that will recur, it is widely supposed that sets and classes\nare abstract entities\u2014even the impure sets whose\nurelements are concrete objects. Any account of the abstract/concrete\ndistinction that places set-theoretic constructions like\n\\(\\{\\textrm{Alfred}, \\{\\textrm{Betty}, \\{\\textrm{Charlie},\n\\textrm{Deborah}\\}\\}\\}\\) on the concrete side of the line will be\nseriously at odds with standard usage. With this in mind, consider the\nset whose sole members are X\u2019s afterimage and Y\u2019s\nheadache, or some more complex set-theoretic object based on these\nitems. If we suppose, as is plausible, that an impure set exists at a\ntime only when its members exist at that time, this will be a\nmind-dependent entity in the generous sense. But it is also presumably\nan abstract entity.\n\nA similar problem arises for so-called abstract artifacts,\nlike Jane Austen\u2019s novels and the characters that inhabit them.\nSome philosophers regard such items as eternally existing abstract\nentities that worldly authors merely describe but do not create. But\nof course the commonsensical view is that Austen created Pride and\nPrejudice and Elizabeth Bennett, and there is no good reason to\ndeny this (Thomasson 1999; cf. Sainsbury 2009). If we take this\ncommonsensical approach, there will be a clear sense in which these\nitems depend for their existence on Austen\u2019s mental activity,\nand perhaps on the mental activity of subsequent \nreaders.[5] \nThese items\nmay not count as mind-dependent in either of the senses canvassed\nabove, since Pride and Prejudice can presumably exist at a\ntime even if no one happens to be thinking at that time. (If the world\ntook a brief collective nap, Pride and Prejudice would not\npop out of existence.) But they are obviously mind-dependent in some\nnot-merely-causal sense. And yet they are still presumably abstract\nobjects. For these reasons, it is probably a mistake to insist that\nabstract objects be mind-independent. (For more on mind-dependence,\nsee Rosen 1994, and the entry\n platonism in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n\nFrege\u2019s proposal in its original form also fails for other\nreasons. Quarks and electrons are usually considered neither sensible\nnor mind-dependent. And yet they are not abstract objects. A better\nversion of Frege\u2019s proposal would hold that:\n\nAn object is abstract if and only if it is both non-physical and\nnon-mental.\n\nTwo remarks on this last version are in order. First, it opens the\ndoor to thinking that besides abstract and concrete entities (assuming\nthat physical objects, in a broad sense, are concrete), there are\nmental entities that are neither concrete nor abstract. As mentioned\nabove (section 1.2), there is no need to insist that the distinction\nis an exhaustive one. Second, while the approach may well draw an\nimportant line, it inherits one familiar problem, namely, that of\nsaying what it is for a thing to be a physical object (Crane\nand Mellor 1990; for discussion, see the entry on\n physicalism).\n In one sense, a physical entity is an entity in which physics might\ntake an interest. But physics is saturated with mathematics, so in\nthis sense a great many paradigmatically abstract objects\u2014e.g.\n\\(\\pi\\)\u2014will count as physical. The intended point is that\nabstract objects are to be distinguished, not from all of the\nobjects posited by physics, but from the concrete objects\nposited by the physics. But if that is the point, it is unilluminating\nin the present context to say that abstract objects are\nnon-physical.\n3.5.2 The Non-Spatiality Criterion\n\nContemporary purveyors of the way of negation typically amend\nFrege\u2019s criterion by requiring that abstract objects be\nnon-spatial, causally inefficacious, or both. Indeed, if any\ncharacterization of the abstract deserves to be regarded as the\nstandard one, is this:\n\nAn object is abstract if and only if it is non-spatial and causally\ninefficacious.\n\nThis standard account nonetheless presents a number of\nperplexities.\n\nFirst of all, one must consider whether there are abstract objects\nthat have one of the two features but not the other. For example,\nconsider an impure set, such as the unit set of Plato (i.e.,\n\\(\\{\\textrm{Plato}\\}\\)). It has some claim to being abstract because\nit is causally inefficacious, but some might suggest that it has a\nlocation in space (namely, wherever Plato is located). Or consider a\nwork of fiction such as Kafka\u2019s The Metamorphosis. It,\ntoo, has some claim to being abstract because it (or at least its\ncontent) is non-spatial. But one might suggest that works of fiction\nas paradigmatic abstract objects seem to have causal powers, e.g.,\npowers to affect us.\n\nIn the remainder of this subsection, we focus on the first criterion\nin the above proposal, namely, the non-spatial condition. But it gives\nrise to a subtlety. It seems plausible to suggest that, necessarily,\nif something \\(x\\) is causally efficacious, then (since \\(x\\) is a\ncause or has causal powers) \\(x\\), or some part of \\(x\\), has a\nlocation in time. So if something has no location in time, it is\ncausally inefficacious. The theory of relativity implies that space\nand time are nonseparable, i.e., combined into a single\nspacetime manifold. So the above proposal might be restated\nin terms of a single condition: an object is abstract if and only if\nit is non-spatiotemporal. Sometimes this revised proposal is the\ncorrect one for thinking about abstract objects, but our discussion in\nthe previous section showed that abstract artifacts and mental events\nmay be temporal but non-spatial. Given the complexities here, in what\nfollows we use spatiotemporality, spatiality, or temporality, as\nneeded.\n\nSome of the archetypes of abstractness are non-spatiotemporal in a\nstraightforward sense. It makes no sense to ask where the cosine\nfunction was last Tuesday. Or if it makes sense to ask, the sensible\nanswer is that it was nowhere. Similarly, for many people, it makes no\ngood sense to ask when the Pythagorean Theorem came to be. Or if it\ndoes make sense to ask, the only sensible answer for them is that it\nhas always existed, or perhaps that it does not exist \u2018in\ntime\u2019 at all. It is generally assumed that these paradigmatic\n\u2018pure abstracta\u2019 have no non-trivial spatial or temporal\nproperties; that they have no spatial location, and they exist nowhere\nin particular in time.\n\nOther abstract objects appear to stand in a more interesting relation\nto spacetime. Consider the game of chess. Some philosophers will say\nthat chess is like a mathematical object, existing nowhere and\n\u2018no when\u2019\u2014either eternally or outside of time\naltogether. But the most natural view is that chess was invented at a\ncertain time and place (though it may be hard to say exactly where or\nwhen); that before it was invented it did not exist at all; that it\nwas imported from India into Persia in the 7th century; that it has\nchanged over the years, and so on. The only reason to resist this\nnatural account is the thought that since chess is clearly an abstract\nobject\u2014it\u2019s not a physical object, after all!\u2014and\nsince abstract objects do not exist in space and time\u2014by\ndefinition!\u2014chess must resemble the cosine function in its\nrelation to space and time. And yet one might with equal justice\nregard the case of chess and other abstract artifacts as\ncounterexamples to the hasty view that abstract objects possess only\ntrivial spatial and temporal properties.\n\nShould we then abandon the non-spatiotemporality criterion? Not\nnecessarily. Even if there is a sense in which some abstract entities\npossess non-trivial spatiotemporal properties, it might still be said\nthat concrete entities exist in spacetime in a distinctive\nway. If we had an account of this distinctive manner of\nspatiotemporal existence characteristic of concrete objects, we could\nsay: An object is abstract (if and) only if it fails to exist in\nspacetime in that way.\n\nOne way to implement this approach is to note that paradigmatic\nconcrete objects tend to occupy a relatively determinate spatial\nvolume at each time at which they exist, or a determinate volume of\nspacetime over the course of their existence. It makes sense to ask of\nsuch an object, \u2018Where is it now, and how much space does it\noccupy?\u2019 even if the answer must sometimes be somewhat vague. By\ncontrast, even if the game of chess is somehow\n\u2018implicated\u2019 in space and time, it makes no sense to ask\nhow much space it now occupies. (To the extent that this does make\nsense, the only sensible answer is that it occupies no space at all,\nwhich is not to say that it occupies a spatial point.) And so it might\nbe said:\n\nAn object is abstract (if and) only if it fails to occupy anything\nlike a determinate region of space (or spacetime).\n\nThis promising idea raises several questions. First, it is conceivable\nthat certain items that are standardly regarded as abstract might\nnonetheless occupy determinate volumes of space and time. Consider,\nfor example, the various sets composed from Peter and Paul:\n\\(\\{\\textrm{Peter}, \\textrm{Paul}\\},\\) \\(\\{\\textrm{Peter},\n\\{\\textrm{Peter}, \\{\\{\\textrm{Paul}\\}\\}\\}\\},\\) etc. We don\u2019t\nnormally ask where such things are, or how much space they occupy. And\nindeed many philosophers will say that the question makes no sense, or\nthat the answer is a dismissive \u2018nowhere, none\u2019. But this\nanswer is not forced upon us by anything in set theory or metaphysics.\nEven if we grant that pure sets stand in only the most\ntrivial relations to space, it is open to us to hold, as some\nphilosophers have done, that impure sets exist where and when their\nmembers do (Lewis 1986a). It is not unnatural to say that a set of\nbooks is located on a certain shelf in the library, and indeed, there\nare some theoretical reasons for wanting to say this (Maddy 1990). On\na view of this sort, we face a choice: we can say that since impure\nsets exist in space, they are not abstract objects after all; or we\ncan say that since impure sets are abstract, it was a mistake to\nsuppose that abstract objects cannot occupy space.\n\nOne way to finesse this difficulty would be to note that even if\nimpure sets occupy space, they do so in a derivative manner. The set\n\\(\\{\\textrm{Peter}, \\textrm{Paul}\\}\\) occupies a location in virtue of\nthe fact that its concrete elements, Peter and Paul, together occupy\nthat location. The set does not occupy the location in its own\nright. With that in mind, it might be said that:\n\nAn object is abstract (if and) only if it either fails to occupy space\nat all, or does so only in virtue of the fact some other\nitems\u2014in this case, its urelements\u2014occupy that\nregion.\n\nBut of course Peter himself occupies a region in virtue of the fact\nthat his parts\u2014his head, hands, etc.\u2014together\noccupy that region. So a better version of the proposal would say:\n\nAn object is abstract (if and) only if it either fails to occupy space\nat all, or does so of the fact that some other items that are not\namong its parts occupy that region.\n\nThis approach appears to classify the cases fairly well, but it is\nsomewhat artificial. Moreover, it raises a number of questions. What\nare we to say about the statue that occupies a region of space, not\nbecause its parts are arrayed in space, but rather because\nits constituting matter occupies that region? And what about\nthe unobserved electron, which according to some interpretations of\nquantum mechanics does not really occupy a region of space at\nall, but rather stands in some more exotic relation to the spacetime\nit inhabits? Suffice it to say that a philosopher who regards\n\u2018non-spatiality\u2019 as a mark of the abstract, but who allows\nthat some abstract objects may have non-trivial spatial properties,\nowes us an account of the distinctive relation to spacetime,\nspace, and time that sets paradigmatic concreta apart.\n\nPerhaps the crucial question about the \u2018non-spatiality\u2019\ncriterion concerns the classification of the parts of space itself. If\nthey are considered concrete, then one might ask where the\nspatiotemporal points or regions are located. And a similar question\narises for spatial points and regions, and for temporal instants or\nintervals. So, the ontological status of spatiotemporal locations, and\nof spatial and temporal locations, is problematic. Let us suppose that\nspace, or spacetime, exists, not just as an object of pure\nmathematics, but as the arena in which physical objects and events are\nsomehow arrayed. It is essential to understand that the problem is not\nabout the numerical coordinates that represent these points and\nregions (or instants and intervals) in a reference system; the issue\nis about the points and regions (or instants and intervals). Physical\nobjects are located \u2018in\u2019 or \u2018at\u2019 regions of\nspace; as a result, they count as concrete according to the\nnon-spatiality criterion. But what about the points and regions of\nspace itself? There has been some debate about whether a commitment to\nspacetime substantivalism is consistent with the nominalist\u2019s\nrejection of abstract entities (Field 1980, 1989; Malament\n1982). If we define the abstract as the \u2018non-spatial\u2019,\nthis debate amounts to whether space itself is to be reckoned\n\u2018spatial\u2019. To reject that these points, regions, instants,\nand intervals, are concrete because they are not located,\nentails featuring them as abstract. However, to think about them as\nabstract sounds a bit weird, given their role in causal processes.\nPerhaps, it is easier to treat them as concrete if we want to\nestablish that concrete entities are spatiotemporal\u2014or spatial\nand temporal.\n\nThe philosopher who believes that there is a serious question about\nwhether the parts of space-time count as concrete would thus do well\nto characterize the abstract/concrete distinction in other terms.\nStill\u2014as mentioned above\u2014the philosopher who thinks that\nit is defensible that parts of space are concrete might use\nnon-spatiality to draw the distinction if she manages to provide a way\nof accounting for how impure sets relate to space differs from the way\nconcreta do.\n3.5.3 The Causal Inefficacy Criterion\n\nAccording to the most widely accepted versions of the way of\nnegation:\n\nAn object is abstract (if and) only if it is causally\ninefficacious.\n\nConcrete objects, whether mental or physical, have causal powers;\nnumbers and functions and the rest make nothing happen. There is no\nsuch thing as causal commerce with the game of chess itself (as\ndistinct from its concrete instances). And even if impure sets do in\nsome sense exist in space, it is easy enough to believe that they make\nno distinctive causal contribution to what transpires. Peter\nand Paul may have effects individually. They may even have effects\ntogether that neither has on his own. But these joint effects are\nnaturally construed as effects of two concrete objects acting jointly,\nor perhaps as effects of their mereological aggregate (itself usually\nregarded as concretum), rather than as effects of some set-theoretic\nconstruction. Suppose Peter and Paul together tip a balance. If we\nentertain the possibility that this event is caused by a set, we shall\nhave to ask which set caused it: the set containing just Peter and\nPaul? Some more elaborate construction based on them? Or is it perhaps\nthe set containing the molecules that compose Peter and Paul? This\nproliferation of possible answers suggests that it was a mistake to\ncredit sets with causal powers in the first place. This is good news\nfor those who wish to say that all sets are abstract.\n\n(Note, however, that some writers identify ordinary physical\nevents\u2014causally efficacious items par excellence\u2014with\nsets. For David Lewis, for example, an event like the fall of Rome is\nan ordered pair whose first member is a region of spacetime, and whose\nsecond member is a set of such regions (Lewis 1986b). On this account,\nit would be disastrous to say both that impure sets are abstract\nobjects, and that abstract objects are non-causal.)\n\nThe biggest challenge to characterizing abstracta as causally\ninefficacious entities is that causality itself is a\nnotoriously problematic and difficult to define idea. It is\nundoubtedly one of the most controversial notions in the history of\nthought, with all kinds of views having been put forward on the\nmatter. Thus, causally efficacious inherits any unclarity\nthat attaches to causality. So, if we are to move the\ndiscussion forward, we need to take the notion of\ncausation\u2014understood as a relation among events\u2014as\nsufficiently clear, even though in fact it is not. Having acknowledged\nthis no doubt na\u00efve assumption, several difficulties arise for\nthe suggestion that abstract objects are precisely the causally\ninefficacious objects.\n\nThe idea that causal inefficacy constitutes a sufficient\ncondition for abstractness is somewhat at odds with standard usage.\nSome philosophers believe in \u2018epiphenomenal qualia\u2019:\nobjects of conscious awareness (sense data), or qualitative conscious\nstates that may be caused by physical processes in the brain, but\nwhich have no downstream causal consequences of their own (Jackson\n1982; Chalmers 1996). These items are causally inefficacious if they\nexist, but they are not normally regarded as abstract. The proponent\nof the causal inefficacy criterion might respond by insisting that\nabstract objects are distinctively neither causes nor\neffects. But this is perilous. Abstract artifacts like Jane\nAusten\u2019s novels (as we normally conceive them) come into being\nas a result of human activity. The same goes for impure sets,\nwhich come into being when their concrete urelements are created.\nThese items are clearly effects in some good sense; yet they\nremain abstract if they exist at all. It is unclear how the proponent\nof the strong version of the causal inefficacy criterion (which views\ncausal inefficacy as both necessary and sufficient for abstractness)\nmight best respond to this problem.\n\nApart from this worry, there are no decisive intuitive counterexamples\nto this account of the abstract/concrete distinction. The chief\ndifficulty\u2014and it is hardly decisive\u2014is rather conceptual.\nIt is widely maintained that causation, strictly speaking, is a\nrelation among events or states of affairs. If we say that the\nrock\u2014an object\u2014caused the window to break, what we mean is\nthat some event or state (or fact or condition) involving the\nrock caused the break. If the rock itself is a cause, it is a cause in\nsome derivative sense. But this derivative sense has proved elusive.\nThe rock\u2019s hitting the window is an event in which the rock\n\u2018participates\u2019 in a certain way, and it is because the\nrock participates in events in this way that we credit the rock itself\nwith causal efficacy. But what is it for an object to\nparticipate in an event? Suppose John is thinking about the\nPythagorean Theorem and you ask him to say what\u2019s on his mind.\nHis response is an event\u2014the utterance of a sentence; and one of\nits causes is the event of John\u2019s thinking about the theorem.\nDoes the Pythagorean Theorem \u2018participate\u2019 in this event?\nThere is surely some sense in which it does. The event\nconsists in John\u2019s coming to stand in a certain relation to the\ntheorem, just as the rock\u2019s hitting the window consists in the\nrock\u2019s coming to stand in a certain relation to the glass. But\nwe do not credit the Pythagorean Theorem with causal efficacy simply\nbecause it participates in this sense in an event which is a\ncause.\n\nThe challenge is therefore to characterize the distinctive manner of\n\u2018participation in the causal order\u2019 that distinguishes the\nconcrete entities. This problem has received relatively little\nattention. There is no reason to believe that it cannot be solved,\nthough the varieties of philosophical analysis for the notion of\ncausality make the task full of pitfalls. Anyway, in the\nabsence of a solution, this standard version of the way of\nnegation must be reckoned a work in progress.\n3.5.4 The Discernibility / Non-Duplication Criteria\n\nSome philosophers have supposed that, under certain conditions, there\nare numerically different but indiscernible concrete entities, i.e.,\nthat there are distinct concrete objects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that\nexemplify the same properties. If this can be sustained, then one\nmight suggest that distinct abstract objects are always discernible\nor, in a weaker formulation, that distinct abstract objects are never\nduplicates.\n\nCowling (2017, 86\u201389) analyzes whether the abstract/concrete\ndistinction thus rendered is fruitful, though criteria in this line\nare normally offered as glosses on the universal/particular\ndistinction. As part of his analysis, he deploys two pairs of (not\nuncontroversial) distinctions: (i) between qualitative and\nnon-qualitative properties, and (ii) between intrinsic and extrinsic\nproperties. Roughly, a non-qualitative property is one that involves\nspecific individuals (e.g., being the teacher of Alexander the\nGreat, being Albert Einstein, etc.), while qualitative\nproperties are not (e.g., having mass, having a\nshape, having a length, etc.). Intrinsic properties are\nthose an object has regardless of what other objects are like and\nregardless of its relationships with other objects (e.g., being\nmade of copper). By contrast, an object\u2019s extrinsic\nproperties are those that depend on other entities (e.g., being\nthe fastest\n car).[6]\n\n\nWith these distinctions in mind, it seems impossible that there be\ndistinct abstract entities which are qualitatively indiscernible; each\nabstract entity is expected to have a unique, distinctive qualitative\nintrinsic nature (or property), which is giving reason for its\nmetaphysical being. This wouldn\u2019t be the case for any concrete\nentity given the initial assumption in this section. Therefore, the\nfollowing criterion of discernability could be pondered:\n\n\\(x\\) is an abstract object iff it is impossible for there to be an\nobject which is qualitatively indiscernible from \\(x\\) but distinct\nfrom \\(x\\).\n\nHowever, one can develop a counterexample to the above proposal, by\nconsidering two concrete objects that are indiscernible with respect\nto their intrinsic qualitative properties. Cowling (2017) considers\nthe case of a possible world with only two perfectly spherical balls,\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), that share the same intrinsic qualitative properties\nand that are floating at a certain distance from each other. So \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) are distinct concrete objects but indiscernible in terms of\ntheir intrinsic qualitative\nproperties.[7]\nBut Lewis has pointed out that \u201cif two individuals are\nindiscernible then so are their unit sets\u201d (1986a, 84). If this\nis correct, \\(\\{A\\}\\) and \\(\\{B\\}\\) would be indiscernible, but (at\nleast for some philosophers) distinct abstract objects, contrary to\nthe discernibility criterion.[8] It is possible to counter-argue that we could\nhappily accept impure sets as concrete; after all, it was always a bit\nunclear how they should be classified. Obviously, this has the\nproblematic consequence of having some sets\u2014pure sets\u2014as\nabstract and other sets\u2014impure sets\u2014as concrete. But the\nidea that abstract objects have distinctive intrinsic natures allows\none to establish a criterion less strong than that of discernibility;\nif an entity has a distinctive intrinsic nature, it cannot have a\nduplicate. So, the next criterion of non-duplication can be put\nforward:\n\n\\(x\\) is an abstract object iff it is impossible for there to be an\nobject which is a duplicate of \\(x\\) but distinct from \\(x\\).\n\nBut there is a more serious counterexample to this criterion, namely,\nimmanent universals. These are purportedly concrete objects, for they\nare universals wholly present where their instances are. But this\ncriterion renders them abstract. Take the color scarlet; it is a\nuniversal wholly present in every scarlet thing. Each of the scarlets\nin those things is an immanent universal. These are non-duplicable,\nbut at least according to Armstrong (1978, I, 77, though see 1989,\n98\u201399), they are paradigmatically concrete: spatiotemporally\nlocated, causally efficacious, etc. Despite how promising they\ninitially seemed, the criteria of discernibility and non-duplicability\ndo not appear to capture the abstract/concrete distinction.\n",
