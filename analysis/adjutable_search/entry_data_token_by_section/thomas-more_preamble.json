September 1521 letter to Guillaume\nBud\u00e9 [EW 1376.9]), has been recognized as one of the\nforemost early modern humanists in England, particularly in view of\nhis well-known Utopia and his History of King Richard\nIII. Whether years later Chancellor More remained such a man, or\nbecame repressive in his outlook and action, remains a topic of\ncontroversy. After law school and the best education available in\nLondon and Oxford, More mastered ancient Greek and encouraged Erasmus\nto do so as well, convinced of the need to return to the sources of\nclassical and biblical thought. Throughout his life he stressed the\nimportance of philosophy; he himself devoted his early morning hours\nto study and reflection even during his busiest years\u2014as is\nevidenced by the twenty books, the 291 poems, and the surviving 151\nletters that he wrote in the midst of an active civic life. He\nidentified himself frequently as a \u201ccitizen of London\u201d and\nwas known as a distinguished lawyer, judge, member of Parliament,\nambassador, and prominent proponent of women\u2019s education; he\nbecame Speaker of the House of Commons, Chancellor of the Duchy of\nLancaster, then for three years Lord Chancellor of England and\nprosecutor of heretics under King Henry VIII. In taking the oath of\noffice as Chancellor, More swore to uphold England\u2019s\n128-year-old heresy laws and, while he was in office, six individuals\nwere convicted of heresy by ecclesiastical courts and then executed\nunder secular law. He himself was executed for failing to recognize\nthe legislation of 1532\u201334 making Henry VIII head of the Church\nof England and for failing to support the king\u2019s divorce from\nCatherine of Aragon and marriage to Anne Boleyn.\n\nThis entry is limited to Thomas More\u2019s understanding and\npractice of philosophy, enlightened, as he believed it to be, by\nbiblical revelation. Intellectually, he was most deeply indebted to\nPlato, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, the Bible, and the Latin and Greek\nChurch Fathers (especially Augustine, Jerome, Basil, and Chrysostom;\nsee Concordances in\n Other Internet Resources).\n",
