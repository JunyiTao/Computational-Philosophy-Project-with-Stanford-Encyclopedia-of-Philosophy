    "main_text": "Empirical Research on Moral Disagreement\n2. Empirical Research on Moral Disagreement\n\n\nThe question about the extent to which the existing moral\ndisagreement is radical is essentially an empirical one. Yet references\nin the philosophical discussion to the numerous studies by\nanthropologists, historians, psychologists and sociologists who have\ndocumented the disagreement are relatively\n sparse.[2]\nThis may seem regrettable, and some have\naccordingly emphasized that philosophers should pay more attention to\nempirical research (see, e.g., Sturgeon 1994, 230 and Loeb 1998, 284).\nThat is surely good advice, but the absence of references to the\nempirical literature is also to some extent understandable.\n\n\nOne reason for this is that much of the philosophical discussion\nfocuses on the implications of the claim that much moral disagreement\nis radical, rather than on the truth of that claim. Another is that\nsome arguments merely appeal to the possibility of radical\nmoral disagreement and are consistent with thinking that all actual\ndisputes involve some shortcoming. (See e.g., Tolhurst 1987, and Wright\n1992 and 1996. See also the references to antirealists who use thought\nexperiments of the type considered in section\n 5.)[3]\nThat approach raises methodological questions of its\nown, of course, especially if one is not willing to extend one\u2019s\nantirealism to all other domains. For then one must explain how one can\nestablish that disagreements of the pertinent kind are possible in\nethics but not in the other domains. The role empirical evidence might\nhave in that context is a complex issue.\n\n\nA further reason for the absence of references to empirical studies\nin the metaethical literature is that their relevance is often unclear,\npartly since the studies have typically not been guided by the rather\nspecific concerns that philosophers reflect on (such as whether the\ndisagreement is radical). However, that might be better seen as a\nreason to scrutinize those studies more carefully than to ignore them\naltogether. It may also be a reason for philosophers to take a more\nactive role in the empirical research themselves and to find ways to\ncollaborate with those who are trained in those areas.\n\n\nSome important efforts along those lines have in fact been made. A\nprominent example is Richard Brandt\u2019s study (1954) of the Hopi\npeople, which revealed differences in basic moral attitudes between the\nHopi and white Americans that could not, he thought, be explained with\ndifferences in non-moral beliefs. (See Moody-Adams 1997 for a critique,\nand Abarbanell and Hauser 2010 and Barrett et al. 2016 for two more\nrecent examples.) An attempt to argue that there is empirical evidence\nfor the existence of radical moral disagreement that has been widely\ndiscussed in recent years has been made by John Doris, Alexandra\nPlakias and Stephen Stich (Doris and Plakias 2008a; Doris and Plakias\n2008b, and Doris and Stich 2007). They appeal to research conducted by\nthe social psychologists Dov Cohen and Richard Nisbett (1996) about why\ncertain types of violence among non-Hispanic whites are more common in\nthe American South than in the North. Cohen and Nisbett attribute this\ndifference to the existence in the South of a \u201cculture of\nhonor\u201d, which permits harsh responses even to minor insults. As\nfor why such a culture is more prevalent there, Cohen and Nisbett point\nto the fact that early European migrants to the United States settled\nin different regions. Many who went to the South were descendants of\npeople whose morals had been forged in herding economies (in Scotland,\nfor example), where a reputation for being prone to violent retaliation\nlessened the risk of having one\u2019s cattle stolen.\n\n\nDoris et al. argue that the difference Cohen and Nisbett have\nrevealed is a plausible candidate of a disagreement which would persist\nunder ideal conditions, as it is unreasonable to attribute it to\nunawareness of non-moral facts or to other obvious types of distorting\nfactors. But they also acknowledge the tentativeness of their\ncontention and that there are further options for those who want to\nexplain away the difference (see, e.g., Doris et al. 2020). One is to\npursue the aforementioned suggestion by Brink (see also Loeb 1998) to\nthe effect that the failure to expose one\u2019s moral beliefs to\ntheoretical reflection is a shortcoming. The type of reflection he has\nin mind is associated with a reflective equilibrium-style method for\nmoral inquiry, which prescribes the pursuit of coherence and\nsystematicity. Arguably, the evidence presented by Cohen and Nisbett is\nnot enough to confidently conclude that the disagreements would survive\ncompetent applications of that method. (See Fitzpatrick 2014. For\nfurther discussion, see Tersman 2006, ch. 2; Bloomfield 2008; and\nFraser and Hauser 2010.)\n\n\nThe idea that an insufficient amount of reflection counts as a\nshortcoming may justify focusing especially on disagreements among\nphilosophers, as Brian Leiter (2014) does. But a problem is that the\navailable characterizations of the pertinent method of reflection are\nrather vague. It may therefore be hard to determine whether\nany individual has applied it competently or not. Moreover,\nhow any such method is to be specified, and even if it is to be used at\nall, are controversial issues within philosophy. Something similar\nholds for other potential candidates of relevant shortcomings. For\nexample, what about cases where our moral convictions are influenced by\nour emotions? It is common to view such influence as a distorting\nfactor (e.g., Singer 2005 and Sayre-McCord 2015), but on some views in\nmoral epistemology, and given the benign roles emotions sometimes play\nin cognitive processes, it may need to be qualified (see Le Doux 1996\nand Nussbaum 2001 for two influential accounts of the epistemic\nsignificance of emotions). Before those and many related issues are\nsettled, and thus before we have established a comprehensive list of\nclearly defined factors which count as shortcomings, all confident\nestimates of the extent to which the existing moral disagreement is\nradical may seem premature.\n",
