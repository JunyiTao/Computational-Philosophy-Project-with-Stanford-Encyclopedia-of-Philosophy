    "main_text": "The Law\u2019s Explicit Definition of Causation || The dominant definition of cause-in-fact\n2.2 The dominant definition of cause-in-fact\n\nThose who accept the conventional division of causation in the law\ninto two parts, then posit a very minimalist notion of the first\nrequirement, that of \u201ccause-in-fact\u201d. This minimalist\nrequirement is by far the dominant explicit test for cause in fact in\nboth torts and criminal law. It is the \u201csine qua\nnon\u201d, or \u201cbut-for\u201d test. Such a test asks a\ncounterfactual question: \u201cbut for the defendant\u2019s action,\nwould the victim have been harmed as she was?\u201d This test is also sometimes\ncalled the necessary condition test, because it requires the\ndefendant\u2019s action have been necessary to the victim\u2019s\nharm. The appeal of this test stems from this fact. The test seems to\nisolate something we seem to care a lot about, both in explaining\nevents and in assessing responsibility for them, namely, did the\ndefendant\u2019s act make a difference\nvis-\u00e0-vis how the world would have been had she not\ndone what she did? Insofar as we increase moral blameworthiness and\nlegal punishment for actors who cause bad results (and not\njust try to), we seemingly should care whether a particular bad result\nwould have happened anyway, even without the defendant.\n",
