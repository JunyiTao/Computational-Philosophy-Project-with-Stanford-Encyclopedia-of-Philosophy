Fundamental Themes in Feminist Legal Philosophy\n\nIn philosophy of law, as in feminist theory more generally, methods,\npresumptions, and approaches vary considerably. Radical, socialist and\nMarxist, postcolonial, transnational, relational, cultural,\npostmodern, dominance, difference, pragmatist, liberal, and neoliberal\napproaches to feminism are all represented in and provide differing\ncontributions to feminist legal philosophy. Moreover, feminist legal\ntheory has developed over time, with concerns such as equality,\nliberty, dominance and difference, and diversity and globalization\nprevailing at different points (Chamallas 2003).\n\nDespite all these differences of focus, emphasis, or approach, certain\nthemes are common. Normative assumptions include the equal moral worth\nof all human beings (and perhaps of some non-human animals as well)\nand the entitlement of beings of such moral worth to equal treatment\nunder the law, however this might be understood. Feminist philosophers\nof law also share certain basic criticisms of traditional views of the\nnature of law and legal reasoning, of patriarchal assumptions as\nreflected in law, and of the problems that women have in securing\nequal justice under law (Smith, 1993, ch. 6). They are attuned to the\nways that power in society is shaped by the shortcomings of various\nlegal systems as well as to the complexities of improving these\nsystems, including how to decide the meaning of equal treatment under\nlaw and how it might be achieved. For example, feminist philosophers\nof law may disagree about the extent to which law should attempt to\nprevent dominance within intimate relationships and is complicit in\noppression if it does not. Neoliberal views emphasize liberty and\nconsent; criticisms of neoliberalism include the practical\ndifficulties of choice under circumstances of patriarchy or economic\nconstraints. To take another example, difference feminists and liberal\nfeminists struggle with the meaning of equality under law and whether\nachieving equality might in some circumstances require different\ntreatment.\n",
