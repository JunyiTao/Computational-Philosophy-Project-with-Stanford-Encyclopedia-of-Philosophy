    "main_text": "Individually-Based Accounts and Radical Cognitive Disability: The Challenge of Exclusion || Proxy, Derivative, and Presumptive Moral Status\n4.2 Proxy, Derivative, and Presumptive Moral Status\n\nA second general way of accommodating the powerful intuitions about\nthe full moral status of all human beings is to recognize alternatives\nto the actual possession of the status-conferring attributes. One\nversion of this approach treats human beings with radical cognitive\ndisabilities as, in effect, capable of acquiring the necessary\nattributes by proxy, through their relationships with other human\nbeings. Thomas Scanlon (1998), for example, affirms the full moral\nstatus of all human beings while basing full moral status (\u201cthe\nrequirement of justifiability\u201d) on the individual capacity for\n\u201cjudgment-sensitive\u201d attitudes. Although he recognizes\nthat radically-impaired humans lack those attributes, he suggests that\nthey can acquire them vicariously, through trustees:\n\n\nThe tie of birth gives us good reason to want to treat [human beings\nlacking the capacity for judgment-sensitive attitudes] \u201cas\nhumans\u201d despite their limited capacities. Because of these\nlimitations, the idea of justifiability to them must be understood\ncounterfactually, in terms of what they could reasonably reject if\nthey were able to understand such a question. This makes the idea of\ntrusteeship appropriate in their case, whether it is appropriate in\nthe case of nonhuman animals or not. It also indicates a basis on\nwhich such a trustee could object to proposed principles. Severely\ndisabled humans have reason to want those things that any human being\nhas reason to want, insofar as those are things that they are capable\nof benefiting from. (185\u2013186)\n\n\nScanlon himself may understand trusteeship merely as a way of\nrealizing or respecting the full moral status of human beings with\nradical impairments, a status that is based on \u201cthe ties of\nbirth.\u201d Other philosophers, however, suggest that trusteeship\ncan secure full moral status by helping to satisfy criteria that could\nnot otherwise be met. Thus, Francis and Silvers (Francis 2009; Silvers\nand Francis 2009) argue that cognitively normal human beings can\nfunction as \u201cmental prostheses\u201d for radically impaired\nones:\n\n\n[A]s a prosthetic arm or leg executes some of the functions of a\nmissing fleshly limb without being confused with or supplanting the\nusual fleshly limb, so, we propose, a trustee\u2019s reasoning and\ncommunicating can execute part or all of a subject\u2019s own\nthinking processes without substituting the trustee\u2019s ideas as\nif it were the subject\u2019s own. (485)\n\n\nFor example, trustees can help the subject fashion her own conception\nof the good by carefully eliciting and extrapolating her attitudes and\npreferences.\n\nFrancis and Silvers do not claim that the moral status of human beings\nwith the most significant cognitive impairments could rest on such\ntrusteeship, or on the potential for it. But it is useful to consider\ntwo challenges facing their proposal, which they acknowledge. The\nfirst is the question of authorship or authenticity: It is not clear\nhow a trustee\u2019s reasoning could be said to \u201cexecute\u201d\nall, as opposed to part, of \u201ca subject\u2019s own\nthinking.\u201d It is not clear how the thinking can be the\nsubject\u2019s if it was wholly executed by a trustee (Wasserman and\nMcMahan, 2012). The second challenge, shared by the notion of mental\nprostheses and Scanlon\u2019s notion of the vicarious expression of\njudgment-sensitive attitudes, is the possibility of providing such\nsupport for nonhuman animals\u2014a possibility Scanlon leaves open\nin the above passage. If it could be extended to animals, the\npotential for such representation would ground the full moral status\nof vast numbers of primates and other mammals. To close the\nfloodgates, it would seem necessary to argue that this support was\nless feasible for intelligent animals, even domesticated ones, than it\nwas for radically impaired human beings. Clearly, an argument would be\nneeded that, in Francis and Silvers\u2019 terms, it would be far more\ndifficult to fashion a mental prosthesis for the former.\n\nA proxy approach also raises the difficult question of how the trustee\ncan acquire the moral and epistemic authority to speak for an\nindividual with radical cognitive disabilities. Legal systems assign\ntrustees or guardians to represent the \u201cbest interests\u201d of\nindividuals too immature or impaired to make, or to have made, their\nown judgments. But it is not clear how someone gets\n\u201cappointed\u201d as a trustee for purposes of securing moral\nstatus. Moreover, even those closest and most committed to an\nindividual with radical cognitive impairments may find it hard to\ndiscern his interests, and distinguish them from their own\n\u201cjudgment-sensitive\u201d attitudes.\n\nAnother way of accommodating strong convictions about the full moral\nstatus of all human beings grounds that status in actual relationships\nbetween cognitively normal and radically-disabled human beings.\nBecause of their duties of partiality, the close relatives of\nradically impaired individuals must treat them as if they had full\nmoral status. This could be regarded as an agent-relative status: for\nclose relatives and no one else, radically disabled humans actually\nhave full moral status. But because of the full moral status of those\nclose relatives, other human beings must respect their duty to regard\ntheir disabled kin as full moral equals. They do not, however, have to\nassume that duty themselves. Some proponents of individual-attribute\naccounts\u2014McMahan, for example\u2014appear to take this view. In\ncontrast, some of the group-based accounts in the next section hold\nthat the \u201ctie of birth\u201d requires all cognitively\nnondisabled human beings to accord full moral status to\nradically-impaired human beings, regardless of their relationship. A\nweaker version of this derivative or courtesy position does not claim\nthat a human being with radical cognitive disabilities actually has\nfull moral status even for close family members, merely that they must\ntreat her as if she did. This reduces somewhat (but does not\neliminate) the disparity between family members and third parties, but\nonly by downgrading the moral status of radically-impaired humans even\nfor their most significant others.\n\nFor some philosophers, either version of this view is unsatisfactory,\nfor two related reasons. First, it is too narrow, since it does not\noffer radically impaired human beings complete moral equality. Only a\nsmall subset of other humans need to treat them as moral equals; the\nrest merely need to respect this special relationship. Second, it is\ntoo contingent\u2014a human with radical cognitive impairments owes\neven his partial equality to the existence of close relationships. If\nhis parents and other relatives abandon him or die, he has only a very\ntenuous claim to being treated by the rest of humanity any better than\na non-human animal with similar attributes.\n\nWe would suggest yet another \u201cevidentiary\u201d approach to\naccommodating the conviction that every human being has full moral\nstatus, one that calls for the adoption of a strong, even\n\u201cirrebuttable\u201d presumption of full moral status for all\nhuman beings. This approach is based on the difficulty of assessing\nthe cognitive potential of human beings, the powerful tendency to\nunderestimate the capacity and potential of human beings with any\ndegree of cognitive abnormality, and the terrible cost to individuals\nwho warrant but are denied full moral status. This approach can be\nregarded as rule-consequentialist, in requiring that we sometimes\ndisregard our case-specific judgment because of the high probability\nand substantial costs of error. But it may appeal to many who reject\nrule-consequentialism as a general approach. At the same time, this\nrationale for full moral status may seem uncomfortably grudging and\ncontingent. It appears to imply that, with sufficiently accurate\nassessment tools and sufficiently reliable assessors, we could deny\nmoral status to many human beings whom we now are constrained to treat\nas having it. Moreover, their exclusion would represent moral\nprogress.\n\nSuch a presumption of full moral status for humans with radical\ncognitive disabilities could be given a more robust justification.\nThat justification would treat biological differences, species norms,\nor \u201cties of birth\u201d not as providing independent grounds\nfor full moral status, but as providing very strong reasons for\npresuming it. Perhaps part of the reason we presume this is epistemic,\nbecause it is so difficult to conclude that individuals who look human\nreally lack human capacities. But that is not the whole explanation.\nWhen cognitively nondisabled humans encounter another being with human\nappearance, they customarily respond to that being in ways they do not\nto non-human animals; they use distinctive gestures, facial\nexpression, touch, speech, and other behavior. Such responses assume a\ncapacity for reciprocal exchange that may not always be present. But\neven when it is not, those responses are not idle gestures. They may\nenable communication, and provoke cognitive and social development,\nthat would otherwise not occur. Family members, friends,\nprofessionals, and scholars who work with people who have cognitive\ndisabilities report that the more time they spend with individuals who\ninitially seemed unable to communicate or respond meaningfully, the\nmore they could discern about their interests, desires, and moods\n(Brown and Gothelf 1996; Goode 1994). Indeed, those people often\ndisplay species-typical preferences in clothing, food, socializing,\nand other activities. In sustained interaction with nondisabled humans\nwho treat them as members of the same moral community, cognitively\ndisabled individuals develop socially and psychologically along the\nlines of other human beings. Treating people with cognitive\ndisabilities as if they had potential for typically human feelings,\ndesires and responses, then, can thus become self-fulfilling. This\napproach offers a pragmatic (and consequentialist) justification for\npresuming that all human beings have full moral status: not merely\nbecause of the terrible costs of mistakenly denying that status, but\nbecause treating fellow human beings as capable of joining our moral\ncommunity makes it more likely that they will be able to do so.\n\nThis proposal does not claim that such treatment could never be\neffective if directed toward a dolphin or chimpanzee. But we have\nstronger reasons to treat our fellow human beings this way, however\nsignificant their cognitive disabilities. Our shared embodiment and\ngenetic endowment facilitate our treating them as having the capacity\nor potential for typical human interaction and activity, and make it\nlikely that they will be more responsive to our treatment than a\nnon-human animal with similar cognitive abilities. Other intelligent\nbeings, differently embodied than we are, would have the same reasons\nto treat their fellow beings this way. In recognizing such a\nlimited partiality, we do not treat species as having a moral\nsignificance akin to that of families or even nations. Nor, clearly,\ndo we assume that human beings in particular have special moral\nstatus.\n\nDespite its resolute optimism, this proposal still excludes some human\nbeings from full moral status. It assumes a minimum level of social\nresponsiveness which is almost certainly lacking in human beings with\nanencephaly, and perhaps lacking in human beings with other radical\ncognitive impairments. Yet in its pragmatic justification of a limited\npartiality towards members of the same species, it sets the stage for\nviews that give a more central role to species membership.\n",
