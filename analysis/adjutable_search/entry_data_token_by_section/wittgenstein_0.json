    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWittgenstein was born on April 26, 1889 in Vienna, Austria, to a\nwealthy industrial family, well-situated in intellectual and cultural\nViennese circles. In 1908 he began his studies in aeronautical\nengineering at Manchester University where his interest in the\nphilosophy of pure mathematics led him to Frege. Upon Frege\u2019s\nadvice, in 1911 he went to Cambridge to study with Bertrand Russell.\nRussell wrote, upon meeting Wittgenstein: \u201cAn unknown German\nappeared \u2026 obstinate and perverse, but I think not\nstupid\u201d (quoted by Monk 1990: 38f). Within one year, Russell was\ncommitted: \u201cI shall certainly encourage him. Perhaps he will do\ngreat things \u2026 I love him and feel he will solve the problems I\nam too old to solve\u201d (quoted by Monk 1990: 41). Russell\u2019s\ninsight was accurate. Wittgenstein was idiosyncratic in his habits and\nway of life, yet profoundly acute in his philosophical\nsensitivity.\n\nDuring his years in Cambridge, from 1911 to 1913, Wittgenstein\nconducted several conversations on philosophy and the foundations of\nlogic with Russell, with whom he had an emotional and intense\nrelationship, as well as with Moore and Keynes. He retreated to\nisolation in Norway, for months at a time, in order to ponder these\nphilosophical problems and to work out their solutions. In 1913 he\nreturned to Austria and in 1914, at the start of World War I\n(1914\u20131918), joined the Austrian army. He was taken captive in\n1918 and spent the remaining months of the war at a prison camp. It\nwas during the war that he wrote the notes and drafts of his first\nimportant work, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. After the war\nthe book was published in German and translated into English.\n\nIn the 1920s Wittgenstein, now divorced from philosophy (having, to\nhis mind, solved all philosophical problems in the\nTractatus), gave away his part of his family\u2019s fortune\nand pursued several \u2018professions\u2019 (gardener, teacher,\narchitect, etc.) in and around Vienna. It was only in 1929 that he\nreturned to Cambridge to resume his philosophical vocation, after\nhaving been exposed to discussions on the philosophy of mathematics\nand science with members of the Vienna Circle, whose conception of\nlogical empiricism was indebted to his Tractatus account of\nlogic as tautologous, and his philosophy as concerned with logical\nsyntax. During these first years in Cambridge his conception of\nphilosophy and its problems underwent dramatic changes that are\nrecorded in several volumes of conversations, lecture notes, and\nletters (e.g., Ludwig Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle,\nThe Blue and Brown Books, Philosophical Grammar,\nPhilosophical Remarks). Sometimes termed the \u2018middle\nWittgenstein,\u2019 this period heralds a rejection of dogmatic\nphilosophy, including both traditional works and the\nTractatus itself.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s Wittgenstein conducted seminars at Cambridge,\ndeveloping most of the ideas that he intended to publish in his second\nbook, Philosophical Investigations. These included the turn\nfrom formal logic to ordinary language, novel reflections on\npsychology and mathematics, and a general skepticism concerning\nphilosophy\u2019s pretensions. In 1945 he prepared the final\nmanuscript of the Philosophical Investigations, but, at the\nlast minute, withdrew it from publication (and only authorized its\nposthumous publication). For a few more years he continued his\nphilosophical work, but this is marked by a rich development of,\nrather than a turn away from, his second phase. He traveled during\nthis period to the United States and Ireland, and returned to\nCambridge, where he was diagnosed with cancer. Legend has it that, at\nhis death in 1951, his last words were \u201cTell them I\u2019ve had\na wonderful life\u201d (Monk: 579).\n",
