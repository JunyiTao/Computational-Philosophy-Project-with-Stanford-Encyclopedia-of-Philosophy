On those occasions where such a departure is\nmorally warranted, the theory will suggest that the judge is\nauthorized to proceed according to the higher and perennial law of\nhumanity, the ius gentium or set of universal principles of\nlaw and justice common to all civilized peoples, which deprives\nsettled law\u2014more precisely, what has been accepted in the\njurisdiction as being settled law\u2014of its directiveness for\nsubjects and judges alike. Is this moral authorization also\n\u2018legal\u2019 and \u201caccording to law\u201d?  Is the\nsettled law which the judge is morally authorized to set aside thereby\nbeing treated, even prior to the judge\u2019s handing down of judgment, as\nnot law?  The following section argues that that question should be\nanswered both Yes and No.\n",
