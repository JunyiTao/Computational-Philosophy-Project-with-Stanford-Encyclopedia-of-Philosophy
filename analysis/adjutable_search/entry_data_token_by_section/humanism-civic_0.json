    "main_text": "The Baron Thesis\n1. The Baron Thesis\n\nBaron used the term civic humanism to describe the fusion of two\ndistinct currents of Florentine thought: apolitical so-called\n\u201cPetrarchan\u201d humanism, on the one hand, and the Guelf\ntradition of patriotic resistance by the Florentine city-state to\nimperial domination, on the other (Kallendorf 1996). The\n\u201crebirth\u201d of ancient letters and wisdom (studia\nhumanitas) marked a revolutionary change in the European mind,\nbut it remained limited to the contemplative pleasure and edification\nof quietist poets and scholars until the beginning of the fifteenth\ncentury. Thereafter, it merged with the assertive defense of the\nsovereign independence of the increasingly rich, powerful, and\nconfident merchant cities of Italy. The fusion was effected, according\nto Baron, as a response to a crisis, namely, the reaction of the\nintellectual and political leadership of Florence to the aggressive\nexpansionism of the despots of Milan. The resulting exaltation of\nliberty combined patriotic self-defense with the upholding of a\nrepublican way of life that departed from medieval ideals by asserting\nworldly values and embracing the active life in a manner evocative of\nthe republics of antiquity. According to Baron\u2019s thesis, in the\nface of military danger the patterns of society, economy, and politics\ncame to cohere in a culture, i.e., an ethos infused with an\neducational vision. The main champions of this were the great\nchancellors of the Florentine Republic, Coluccio Salutati and,\nespecially, Leonardo Bruni, top civil servants and public\nintellectuals combined, who restored the practical pertinence of\nclassical learning in the process of establishing the terms of a new\ncivil consensus.\n\nBeyond seeking to identify civic humanism with a particular time and\nplace, Baron studied the political culture of Renaissance Florence as\nan instance of an exemplary mode of communal existence. Florentine\ncivic humanism represented for him furthermore a decisive turning\npoint in history. For Baron it was an epochal event that, by looking\nbackward to antiquity, pointed forward to modernity\u2014a movement\nthat he embraced wholeheartedly as a liberating, civilizing,\nprogressive process. The advent of civic humanism marked for Baron the\nvictory of secular economic, social, and political ideals versus the\nasceticism, religious obscurantism, and hierarchy of the Middle Ages\n(see Yoran 2007). Civic humanism provided the vital vehicle for the\ntranslation of the exalted ancient idea of citizenship to the modern\nage. The humanist defense of republican liberty against monarchical\ntyranny announced for him the beginnings of modern democratic thought,\nelevated by an educational ideal of classical inspiration, and\naccompanied by renewed cultural creativity. Civic humanism was thus\nthe harbinger of the unequivocally positive trends in modern European\ncivilization. The value of such achievements appeared all the more\ncompelling since they were not theoretical postulates derived from\nabstract speculation, but represented historically realized\nexempla.\n\nBaron\u2019s reconstruction of civic humanism was not only directed\nagainst other-worldly values and notions of medieval deference, but\nalso against different modes of construing modernity in terms of the\nautonomy of the self. At issue here, beyond the characterization of a\nhistorical period, was the definition and evaluation of modernity\nitself. Baron wished to see the autonomous humanity he perceived\nemerging in quattrocento Florence integrated within a constitutional\nframe and anchored by patriotic attachment to the community. Baron\nadvocated a vast scholarly program to establish the Italian humanist\ntradition as a major source of modernity. The polities he posited as\ncommendable are not conceived as formal frames of individual life\ngoals\u2014in other words, empty liberalism\u2014but textured wholes\ninto which human autonomy is woven. To state it somewhat\nanachronistically, accepting the nexus of public solidarity embedded\nin civic humanism, and viewing it as an equivalent of civil society,\nBaron\u2019s thesis overlaps considerably with today\u2019s\ncommunitarianism.\n",
