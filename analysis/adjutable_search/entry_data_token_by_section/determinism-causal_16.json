    "main_text": "The Status of Determinism in Physical Theories || Quantum mechanics\n4.4 Quantum mechanics\n\nAs indicated above, QM is widely thought to be a strongly\nnon-deterministic theory. Popular belief (even among most physicists)\nholds that phenomena such as radioactive decay, photon emission and\nabsorption, and many others are such that only a\nprobabilistic description of them can be given. The theory\ndoes not say what happens in a given case, but only says what the\nprobabilities of various results are. So, for example, according to QM\nthe fullest description possible of a radium atom (or a chunk of\nradium, for that matter), does not suffice to determine when a given\natom will decay, nor how many atoms in the chunk will have decayed at\nany given time. The theory gives only the probabilities for a decay\n(or a number of decays) to happen within a given span of time.\nEinstein and others thought that this was a defect of the theory that\nshould eventually be removed, perhaps by a supplemental hidden\nvariable\n theory[7]\n that restores determinism; but subsequent work showed that no such\nhidden variables account could exist. At the microscopic level the\nworld is ultimately mysterious and chancy.\n\nSo goes the story; but like much popular wisdom, it is partly mistaken\nand/or misleading. Ironically, quantum mechanics is one of the best\nprospects for a genuinely deterministic theory in modern times.\nEverything hinges on what interpretational and philosophical decisions\none adopts. The fundamental law at the heart of non-relativistic QM is\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The evolution of a wavefunction\ndescribing a physical system under this equation is normally taken to\nbe perfectly\n deterministic.[8]\n If one adopts an interpretation of QM according to which that\u2019s\nit\u2014i.e., nothing ever interrupts Schr\u00f6dinger evolution, and\nthe wavefunctions governed by the equation tell the complete physical\nstory\u2014then quantum mechanics is a perfectly deterministic\ntheory. There are several interpretations that physicists and\nphilosophers have given of QM which go this way. (See the entries on\n quantum mechanics\n for general discussion and\n Everettian quantum mechanics\n and\n many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanicsfor\n discussion of the most prominent such interpretation).\n\nMore commonly in the 20th century\u2014and this is part of the basis\nfor the popular wisdom\u2014physicists resolved the\n quantum measurement problem\n by postulating that some process of \u201ccollapse of the\nwavefunction\u201d occurs during measurements or observations that\ninterrupts Schr\u00f6dinger evolution. The collapse process is usually\npostulated to be indeterministic, with probabilities for various\noutcomes, via Born\u2019s rule, calculable on the basis of a\nsystem\u2019s wavefunction. The once-standard Copenhagen\ninterpretation of QM posits such a collapse. It has the virtue of\nsolving certain problems such as the infamous Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\ncat paradox, but few philosophers or physicists can take it very\nseriously unless they are instrumentalists about the theory. The\nreason is simple: the collapse process is not physically well-defined,\nis characterised in terms of an anthropomorphic notion\n(measurement) and feels too ad hoc to be a\nfundamental part of nature\u2019s\n laws.[9]\n In recent decades, it is more common to preset the\n\u201ccollapse of the wavefunction\u201d as a merely\neffective or apparent phenomenon, usually by\nappealing to some sort of \u201cdecoherence\u201d that renders the\ncontinuing existence of superpositions empirically undetectable. On\nthis approach, the deterministic and unitary evolution of quantum\nstates is not interrupted (see the entry on the\n many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics).\n\nIn 1952 David Bohm created an alternative theoretical framework for\nnon-relativistic QM that realizes Einstein\u2019s dream of a hidden\nvariable theory, restoring determinism and definiteness to\nmicro-reality. In\n Bohmian quantum mechanics,\n unlike other interpretations, it is postulated that all particles\nhave, at all times, a definite position and velocity. In addition to\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation, Bohm posited a guidance\nequation that determines, on the basis of the system\u2019s\nwavefunction and particles\u2019 initial positions and velocities,\nwhat their future positions and velocities should be. As much as any\nclassical theory of point particles moving under force fields, then,\nBohm\u2019s theory is deterministic. Amazingly, he was also able to\nshow that, as long as the statistical distribution of initial\npositions and velocities of particles are chosen so as to meet a\n\u201cquantum equilibrium\u201d condition, his theory is empirically\nequivalent to standard Copenhagen QM. However, and unfortunately, as\nWallace (2020) has forcefully argued, Bohmian mechanics and its later\nextensions do not yet offer an alternative to the standard quantum\nfield theories of the Standard Model of particle physics. One approach\nto extending Bohmian mechanics to general quantum field theories, that\nof John Bell, changes the theory to being stochastic rather than\ndeterministic.\n\nThis small survey of determinism\u2019s status in some prominent\nphysical theories, as indicated above, does not really tell us\nanything about whether determinism is true of our world. Instead, it\nraises a couple of further disturbing possibilities for the time when\nwe do have the Final Theory before us (if such time ever comes):\nfirst, we may have difficulty establishing whether the Final Theory is\ndeterministic or not\u2014depending on whether the theory comes\nloaded with unsolved interpretational or mathematical puzzles. Second,\nwe may have reason to worry that the Final Theory, if indeterministic,\nhas an empirically equivalent yet deterministic rival (as illustrated\nby Bohmian quantum mechanics.)\n\n",
