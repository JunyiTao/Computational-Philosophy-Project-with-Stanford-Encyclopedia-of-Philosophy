One could agree with Aristotle that \u201cthere will\nbe a sea-battle tomorrow\u201d is not true, even if it turns out that\nthere is a sea battle; but instead of saying that it is neither true\nnor false, one could say that it is false. What is more, one could say\nthat the negation, \u201cthere will not be a sea-battle\ntomorrow\u201d is true. Then we could retain the law of bivalence,\nand the equivalence between \u201cp\u201d and\n\u201cp is true\u201d. Effectively we would be treating\n\u201cp\u201d as equivalent to \u201cit is necessary that\np\u201d. And we would, no doubt, distinguish between\n\u201cthere will not be a sea-battle tomorrow\u201d, where this is\nthe negation of \u201cthere will be a sea-battle tomorrow\u201d and\n\u201cthere will be no sea-battle tomorrow\u201d which, like\n\u201cthere will be a sea-battle tomorrow\u201d, is false. One might\neven say that \u201cthere will not be a sea-battle tomorrow\u201d is\nambiguous; it could be equivalent to \u201cit is not necessary that\nthere will be sea-battle tomorrow\u201d or it could be equivalent to\n\u201cit is necessary that there will be no sea-battle\ntomorrow\u201d. Certainly it is in favour of this view that one would\nretain the law of bivalence and also the truth-functionality of\n\u201cor\u201d and \u201cand\u201d. But there would be a heavy\nprice to pay. Now we should have to say what the person said about Red\nRum was false.\n\n2. (Lucas 1986) One could make use of Reichenbach\u2019s distinction\nbetween the time of the utterance of a proposition, the time of the\nreference point and the time of the event (Reichenbach 1947). One\ncould then say that the truth of what is said depends not on the state\nof the world at the time of the utterance, but on the state of the\nworld at the time of the reference point. One may then say that the\nreference point of the utterance in 1972 of \u201cRed Rum will win\nthe Grand National next year\u201d is 1973, not 1972. So, it was\ntrue. (Whereas, if someone had said \u201cRed Rum is going to win the\nGrand National next year\u201d, the use of \u201cis going to\u201d\nrather than \u201cwill\u201d might perhaps have meant that the\nreference point was the time of the utterance, rather than the time of\nnext year\u2019s Grand National. So what was said would not have been\ntrue.)\n\n3. (Tooley 1997) One could distinguish between truth at a time, which\ndepends on the state of the world at the time, and truth\nsimpliciter, which does not. One could then allow that the\nprediction about Red Rum was true, as long as we are talking about\ntruth simpliciter. Also, where truth simpliciter was\nat issue, we could retain the law of bivalence and the equivalence\nbetween \u201cp\u201d and \u201cp is\ntrue\u201d.\n",
