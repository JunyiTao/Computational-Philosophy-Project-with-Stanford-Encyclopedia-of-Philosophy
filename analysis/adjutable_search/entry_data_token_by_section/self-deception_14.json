    "main_text": "Collective Self-Deception || Summative Collective Self-Deception: Self-Deception Across a Collective\n7.2 Non-Summative Collective Self-Deception: Self-Deception of a Collective Entity\n\nCollective self-deception can also be understood from the perspective\nof the collective itself in a non-summative sense. Though there are\nvarying accounts of group belief, generally speaking, a group can be\nsaid to believe, desire, value, or the like just in case its members\n\u201cjointly commit\u201d to these things as a body (Gilbert 2005).\nA corporate board, for instance, might be jointly committed as a body\nto believe, value, and strive for whatever the CEO recommends. Such\ncommitment need not entail that each individual board member\npersonally endorses such beliefs, values, or goals, only that they do\nso as members of the board (Gilbert 2005). While philosophically\nprecise accounts of non-summative self-deception remain largely\nunarticulated\u2014an exception is Galeotti\u2019s (2018) detailed\nanalysis of how collective self-deception occurs in the context of\npolitics\u2014the possibilities mirror those of individual\nself-deception. When collectively held attitudes motivate a group to\nespouse a false belief despite the group\u2019s possession of\nevidence to the contrary, we can say that the group is collectively\nself-deceived in a non-summative sense.\n\nFor example, Robert Trivers (2000) suggests that \u2018organizational\nself-deception\u2019 led to NASA\u2019s failure to represent\naccurately the risks posed by the space shuttle\u2019s O-ring design,\na failure that eventually led to the Challenger disaster. The\norganization as a whole, he argues, had strong incentives to represent\nsuch risks as small. As a consequence, NASA\u2019s Safety Unit\nmishandled and misrepresented data it possessed that suggested that\nunder certain temperature conditions, the shuttle\u2019s O-rings were\nnot safe. NASA, as an organization, then, self-deceptively believed\nthe risks posed by O-ring damage were minimal. Within the institution,\nhowever, there were a number of individuals who did not share this\nbelief, but both they and the evidence supporting their belief were\ntreated in a biased manner by the decision-makers within the\norganization. As Trivers (2000) puts it, this information was\nrelegated \u201cto portions of \u2026 the organization that [were]\ninaccessible to consciousness (we can think of the people running NASA\nas the conscious part of the organization).\u201d In this case,\ncollectively held values created a climate within NASA that clouded\nits vision of the data and led to its endorsement of a fatally false\nbelief.\n\nCollective self-deceit may also play a significant role in\nfacilitating unethical practices by corporate entities. For example, a\ncollective commitment by members of a corporation to maximizing\nprofits might lead members to form false beliefs about the ethical\npropriety of the corporation\u2019s practices. Gilbert (2005)\nsuggests that such a commitment might lead executives and other\nmembers to \u201csimply lose sight of moral constraints and values\nthey previously held.\u201d Similarly, Tenbrunsel and Messick (2004)\nargue that self-deceptive mechanisms play a pervasive role in what\nthey call \u2018ethical fading,\u2019 acting as a kind of\n\u2018bleach\u2019 that renders organizations blind to the ethical\ndimensions of their decisions. They argue that such self-deceptive\nmechanisms must be recognized and actively resisted at the\norganizational level if unethical behavior is to be avoided. More\nspecifically, Gilbert (2005) contends that collectively accepting that\n\u201ccertain moral constraints must rein in the pursuit of corporate\nprofits\u201d might shift corporate culture in such a way that\nefforts to respect these constraints are recognized as part of being a\ngood corporate citizen. In view of the ramifications this sort of\ncollective self-deception has for the way we understand corporate\nmisconduct and responsibility, understanding its specific nature in\ngreater detail remains an important task.\n\nCollective self-deception, understood in either the summative or\nnon-summative sense, raises significant questions, such as whether\nindividuals within collectives bear responsibility for their\nself-deception or the part they play in the collective\u2019s\nself-deception and whether collective entities can be held responsible\nfor their epistemic failures (see Galeotti 2016b, 2018 on these\nquestions). Finally, collective self-deception prompts us to ask what\nmeans are available to collectives and their members to resist, avoid,\nand escape self-deception. Galeotti (2016b, 2018) argues for a variety\nof institutional constraints and precommitments to keep groups from\nfalling prey to self-deception.\n\nGiven the capacity of collective self-deception to entrench false\nbeliefs and to magnify their consequences\u2014sometimes with\ndisastrous results\u2014collective self-deception is not just a\nphilosophical puzzle; it is a problem that demands attention.\n",
