    "main_text": "Scholasticism and Skepticism || Thirteenth Century\n4.1 Thirteenth Century\n\nThe thirteenth century saw the birth of Scholasticism in the Latin\nWest. As Universities began to develop in such important centers of\nlearning as Paris and Oxford, so too did highly formalized and\nargumentative styles of debate and writing. At the same time, some of\nthe intellectual consequences of the Crusades came to play an\nimportant role in the history of skepticism: Muslim and Jewish\nscholars and writings came to the attention of Christians working on\nsimilar topics. Of particular importance was the translation of all of\nAristotle\u2019s works into Latin, along with many commentaries on\nthem (as well as original works) by Ibn-Rushd (Averroes) and Ibn-Sina\n(Avicenna).\n\nWith these texts came others (such as Al-Haytham\u2019s\nOptics), and Christian scholars such as Roger Bacon began to\ninvestigate the cognitive process more thoroughly in their own\nwritings. The dominant Augustinian theory of knowledge began to come\nunder attack as the wealth of new accounts were contrasted, rejected,\nor synthesized. And as Augustine was reinterpreted, so too was his\nrejection of skepticism.\n4.1.1 Thomas Aquinas and Siger of Brabant\n\nThomas Aquinas (ca. 1225\u20131274) and Siger of Brabant (ca.\n1240\u2013ca. 1282) were philosophers of vastly different reputations\n(the first was declared a saint and holds a preeminent place in\nCatholic theology; the second was accused of heresy and died under\nmysterious circumstances). Yet they both shared a deep commitment to\nsynthesizing the new Aristotelian texts into their respective\nviews.\n\nAquinas, as with Aristotle, exhibits no serious concerns with\nskepticism or with skeptical arguments. He occasionally makes\nreferences to sensory illusions, e.g., but he sees them as no\nepistemological threat. Baertschi (1986) and Pasnau (1997) treat of\nthis issue briefly. Indeed, most of the secondary literature on\nAquinas focuses on the question of why he has no such\ninterest in skepticism. Varying accounts are given, and among them is\nAquinas\u2019s Aristotelian belief that the cognitive process is\nfundamentally a reliable one. For the most part, Aquinas and most\nlater medievals aim to explain the processes by which knowledge is\nacquired, rather than aiming to justify knowledge.\n\nFurthermore, many scholars argue that the Aristotelian doctrine of the\nformal identity of knower and known plays a significant role for\nAquinas in particular. If (on this interpretation) the knower quite\nliterally takes on the form of the known object, and thus becomes\nidentical to the known object in this formal way, then there is no\nchance for error. The knower is not at a remove from the known object\nat all, on this account. There is considerable disagreement about\nAquinas\u2019s motivations here; for a few representative views, see\nGilson (1986), MacDonald (1993), Pasnau (1997), Jenkins (1997), and\nHibbs (1999).\n\nSiger of Brabant, on the other hand, dealt directly with skepticism\nand skeptical arguments in his Impossibile 2 and his\nQuestions on the Metaphysics. Though, as C\u00f4t\u00e9\n(2006) argues, he also declines to take skepticism to be a serious\nthreat, he does take the time to address it. Most notably, Siger\nraises the following question for consideration in\nImpossibile 2: \u201ceverything that appears to us are\nillusions and similar to dreams, so that we are not certain of the\nexistence of anything.\u201d Siger has various responses in his\ndiscussions, but his most important claims are (a) that a failure of\nthe senses in some cases does not automatically imply failure in all\ncases; and (b) that if a sense report is not contradicted by another,\nmore reliable sense report, then it itself is reliable. Furthermore,\nSiger gives a rather unconvincing reductio, arguing that if\nthe senses are unreliable, no knowledge at all is possible. Taking\nthis as a reductio of skepticism obviously would do little to\nassuage the worries of the committed skeptic.\n\nSiger\u2019s responses, though somewhat unsatisfying, do indicate the\nbeginning of a growing interest in skeptical problems. Henry of Ghent\nshows this interest even more starkly.\n4.1.2 Henry of Ghent and the Condemnation of 1277\n\nHenry of Ghent (ca. 1217\u20131293) was one of the most important\ntheological masters of his day, and he was a contemporary of both\nAquinas and Siger. Beyond his own philosophical work, Henry was a\ncentral figure in one of the crucial events in medieval intellectual\nhistory: the Condemnation of 1277, which will be discussed at the end\nof this section. Brown (1973), Marrone (1985), Pasnau (1995), and\nAdams (1987) discuss Henry\u2019s views in some detail.\n\nHenry\u2019s most concentrated attention to skeptical issues occurs\nin the first two questions of his Summa Quaestionum\nOrdinariarum (Ordinary Questions). Henry\u2019s\ndiscussion of skepticism stands out when placed alongside other works\nfrom the same period. Though Augustine\u2019s Contra\nAcademicos was extant, and though Augustine\u2019s De\nTrinitate echoed many of the anti-skeptical arguments from his\nown earlier work, the vast majority of Henry\u2019s scholastic\ncontemporaries (including Aquinas) took no serious interest in\nskepticism. Various explanations of this general attitude can be\ngiven. Perhaps Augustine\u2019s self-proclaimed refutation of\nAcademic skepticism was taken to be the final word on the subject;\nAristotle\u2019s dismissive attitude towards skepticism would have\nreinforced this idea. But for whatever reason, Henry thought the issue\nof skepticism important enough to raise it in the opening question of\nhis own most important theological work.\n\nHenry lists a number of different skeptical arguments, drawing from\nthe critical accounts of Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, and Averroes,\nand mentioning the support skepticism garners from the views of\nHeraclitus, Zeno, Protagoras, and Democritus, and Plato. He gives no\nevidence here of having direct access to any of the texts of the\nlatter five thinkers, though he knows of their views through the works\nof others.\n\nHe begins by listing preliminary arguments both for and against the\npossibility of knowledge. On the skeptic\u2019s side, Henry discusses\ncases of sensory relativism (what seems sweet to one person does not\nseem sweet to another, e.g.); the changeable nature of the sensory\nworld; and the Learner\u2019s Paradox from the Meno. Among\nthe anti-skeptical arguments is Aristotle\u2019s view\n(Metaphysics IV) that in denying knowledge, one is thereby\nclaiming certainty that one does not know, and thus the skeptic must\nadmit to knowing something. He also pulls from Augustine\u2019s\noft-repeated claim that in doubting, one knows that one doubts (De\nvera religione xxxix.73).\n\nHenry then argues in a number of different ways that knowledge is in\nfact possible. First, he draws from Augustine and Cicero. His weakest\nclaim here is that we can rely upon the testimony of others;\notherwise, he says, knowledge of the distant past, or of places that\none has never visited, would be impossible. He also explains that one\ncan trust the veracity of a given sense experience provided it\nhasn\u2019t been contradicted by a more reliable sense experience. In\naddition, he says that even if one is dreaming, one still knows that\none lives. As with many who follow him, Henry cites the certainty of\nthe law of non-contradiction as well.\n\nIn the final section of the question, Henry replies directly to the\nskeptical arguments he outlined in the beginning. Though he gives too\nmany responses to detail here, Henry\u2019s core idea is that though\nthe senses grasp only changeable things, one has the ability to\nabstract what he calls the \u201ccreated exemplar\u201d from the\nobjects of the senses; from this created exemplar, we can obtain a\nlow-level knowledge of external objects (he calls this knowledge of\nthe \u201ctrue\u201d or of the \u201ctruth\u201d). Knowledge in\nthe full sense\u2014that is, knowledge of the \u201cpure\ntruth\u201d\u2014requires knowledge of the \u201cuncreated\nexemplar\u201d, or Divine Idea. Because the created exemplar is\nmutable in itself, it is only by seeing how it accords with the\nuncreated exemplar in God\u2019s mind that full and certain knowledge\nis possible. In short, Henry follows Augustine in spirit, even if not\nin detail: for both philosophers, knowledge is impossible without\nDivine Illumination.\n\nIn the second question of his Summa, Henry explores\nIllumination in more detail. As he begins to explain things, it sounds\nas if God\u2019s general background influence is sufficient to\nexplain human knowledge. Later, however, Henry limits his optimistic\noutlook. First, he argues that God illuminates each person\n\naccording to his condition and capacity, unless someone by displaying\ngreat malice merits that it be taken away from him altogether. Such a\nperson, as a result, would not see any truth at all\u2026but would\ndissipate into the error that he deserves. (Summa I.2.134)\n\n\nEchoing some of Augustine\u2019s remarks in the De Magistro,\nHenry here seems to restrict epistemic certainty to those who are\nmorally worthy. Second, Henry diverges even further from his initial\nargument, saying that God offers the \u201crules of the eternal\nlight\u201d\u2014that is, the Divine Ideas\u2014\n\nto whomever he wants and takes them away from whomever he\nwants\u2026 Thus God sometimes bestows the eternal rules on bad\npeople, with the result that in these rules they see many truths that\nthe good cannot see\u2026 Sometimes, too, God takes these same rules\naway from such people and allows them to fall into error\u2026 [God]\nbestows [pure truth] through free will, on whomever he wants.\n(Summa I.2.131\u2013132)\n\n\nIn short, according to this second argument, our ability to know with\ncertainty is entirely dependent upon God\u2019s whim. We will know\nonly in cases in which God wants us to. This emphasis on God\u2019s\nrole in the knowing process is of a piece with the emphasis on Divine\nOmnipotence one finds in the Condemnation of 1277, with which Henry\nwas intimately involved.\n\nAs the newly rediscovered Aristotelian texts began to find their way\ninto university curricula in the thirteenth century, more conservative\nfaculty reacted. Bonaventure and Henry were among the latter, and each\nargued against those who sought to replace the reigning Augustinianism\nwith too many new Aristotelian elements. Aquinas, Siger of Brabant,\nand others sought to synthesize Aristotle and Christianity in a much\nmore thoroughgoing way than Henry thought acceptable. And as part of\nthe commission organized at the Pope\u2019s request, Henry helped\ncreate a list of 219 propositions\u2014some held by Aquinas\nhimself\u2014that were condemned as heretical to the Catholic faith\nin 1277 by Bishop Etienne Tempier.\n\nIf there were ever an instance of philosophical irony in the Middle\nAges, this would be it. Despite Henry\u2019s strong aversion to\nskepticism, and despite his arguments against it, the most important\npractical effect of the Condemnation of 1277 was to introduce an\nentirely new level of skeptical doubt. The Condemnation emphasized\nGod\u2019s omnipotence, and declared views that denied this to be\nheretical. As a result, the realm of the possible was expanded\ndramatically in medieval discussions. This concern quickly spreads\nthroughout most Christian epistemological discussions, up through the\nend of the Middle Ages. If God is omnipotent, according to this\nconcern, couldn\u2019t he be deceiving us either in particular cases,\nor perhaps even globally? For a fascinating discussion of the variety\nof responses one finds in the 13th and 14th century treatments of this\nproblem, see Perler (2010).\n4.2 Fourteenth Century\n\nAfter the Condemnation of 1277, Christian philosophers became even\nmore focused on epistemology. Debates often centered on the medieval\ndistinction between intuitive cognition and abstractive\ncognition\u2014roughly, the distinction between knowing something as\npresent and existent, and knowing something from a remove (e.g.,\nthrough memory, or through an inference). In addition, many\nphilosophers began to explore the nature of sensory illusions in more\ndetail. And of course, the Evil Demon hypothesis loomed ever larger as\nthe notion of Divine Omnipotence was explored more fully.\n4.2.1 John Duns Scotus\n\nJohn Duns Scotus (1265\u20131308) worked in Oxford, Paris, and\nCologne. Living roughly a generation before Ockham, Scotus was a\nfollower of Aristotle, and as with many of his time, Avicenna too had\na profound impact on the development of his thought. As far as\nskepticism is concerned, Scotus is unconvinced by Henry\u2019s\nanti-skeptical arguments, but he thinks the threat of skepticism\ndangerous enough that he devotes considerable attention to arguing\nagainst the problem. Adams (1987) and Pickav\u00e9 (2010) discuss\nhis position in connection with skepticism.\n\nIn his Ordinatio I.3.1.4, Scotus finds Henry\u2019s created\nexemplar/uncreated exemplar distinction insufficient for defeating\nskepticism. Scotus\u2019 critique of Henry has two main foci:\nHenry\u2019s appeal to mutability, and Henry\u2019s need for an\nuncreated exemplar. First, Scotus finds numerous problems with\nHenry\u2019s worries about change, and he argues that change as such\ndoes not prevent knowledge, and that even if it did, much of what we\nknow is sufficiently stable to support our knowledge claims. In\ndefense of his initial claim he argues, e.g., that our own mutability\nwould make knowledge utterly impossible, if Henry\u2019s views are\ncorrect. His second claim about change also receives support in\nvarious ways, most notably by his appeal to what he calls a nature\n(natura), which is (roughly) the essence of a thing. Here, he\nargues that since natures in themselves are immutable, and since each\ncan have what Scotus calls an immutable relation to something else, we\nhave sufficient grounds for stability-based certainty.\n\nHenry\u2019s appeal to an uncreated exemplar to ground knowledge and\ncertainty is also problematic, according to Scotus. If we understand\nthe created exemplar as a species (roughly, an image or intentional\nobject) formed in the soul during an act of cognition, then we are\noften unsure whether that created exemplar existing in the soul truly\ncorresponds to an extramental object. Thus,\n\n\u2026if it cannot be judged when such a species represents itself\nas such and when it represents itself as an object, then [no matter]\nwhat else concurs with such a species, one cannot have [any] certitude\nby which the true may be distinguished from the truthlike.\n(Ordinatio I.3.1.4.104)\n\n\nIn other words, showing that the species in the soul corresponds to an\nuncreated exemplar\u2014that is, a Divine Idea\u2014does\nnothing to help us determine whether that species corresponds to\nsomething in the sensory world.\n\nAccording to Scotus, God has created the world in such a way that\nknowledge is possible by means of his general, background\nillumination, which amounts, in Scotus\u2019 view, to a natural\nprocess. With this in mind, we may now turn to an examination of\nScotus\u2019 positive view and its relation to skepticism.\n\nScotus holds that we have \u201cnecessary certitude\u201d about four\nkinds of knowledge. The first type is knowledge of self-evident\npropositions (propositions per se notae)\u2014such as\n\u2018a whole is greater than its parts\u2019\u2014as well as\nknowledge of propositions derived syllogistically from them. This type\nof knowledge amounts to necessary, analytic truths, in his view: once\none knows the terms that enter into such a proposition, and once those\nterms are combined into the proposition, one cannot help but assent.\nScotus\u2019 second type of knowledge is knowledge of our own\ncontingent acts, including such propositions as \u2018I am\nawake\u2019 and \u2018I am alive\u2019. Scotus follows Augustine in\nholding that such knowledge is immune to skeptical attack because even\nif the senses are deceived, once these terms are grasped, we can know\nthe truth about them in such propositional contexts.\n\nThough much can be said about these types of knowledge, the most\nrelevant discussions for our purposes deal with the remaining types.\nOur certitude here depends crucially on the following claim:\n\nWhatever happens frequently through something that is not free, has\nthis something as its natural per se cause.\n(Ordinatio I.3.1.4.106)\n\n\nIn other words, Scotus suggests a general inductive principle:\nwhenever something occurs frequently over time, such repeatability\ncannot be due to chance. God has ordained that such regularities will\noccur, and thus we can reach a general principle based on those\ninitial cases. Such regularities amount to natural occurrences, and\nthus require no appeal to special illumination.\n\nGiven this, his third type of certainty is discussed: what Scotus\ncalls things knowable \u201cthrough experience\u201d\u2014e.g.,\nthat \u201ca certain species of herb is hot\u201d. Such general\nclaims, derived through our experience of numerous instances of the\nhotness of such herbs, are certain in virtue of the \u201cnon-free\ncause\u201d principle above. Recognizing, however, that inductions\ndon\u2019t hold the same level of assurance that he is claiming for\nfirst two types of knowledge, Scotus backs off of his claim a bit\nlater, calling it \u201cthe lowest degree of scientific\nknowledge\u201d, and admitting that such inductions may only tell us\nthat such regularities are \u201captitudes\u201d, not certainties\n(Ordinatio I.3.1.4.110\u2013111).\n\nWhen Scotus begins discussing his fourth type of\ncertainty\u2014particular knowledge claims about the external world,\nknown through the senses\u2014he ignores this weakened conception of\nour senses\u2019 reliability. Though later thinkers will be clearer\nin their indebtedness to the Condemnation of 1277 here, Scotus gives\nminimal notice of this. Instead, appealing again to his non-free cause\nclaim, he gives explanations of two main types of such experience.\n\nFirst, because it is often the case that different sense modalities\nagree in their judgment about an external object\u2014e.g., when we\ncan both touch and see the size of a ball\u2014we have an induction\nof sorts running here, and thus we can infer that this regularity is\nenough to give us certainty regarding the object under\nconsideration.\n\nSecond, in cases in which the sense modalities are not in\nagreement\u2014either because one modality yields a different result\nthan another modality, or because a single modality yields different\nresults at different times\u2014we can appeal to the intellect to\nadjudicate among them. Using his example, we know that a stick in\nwater that appears broken cannot really be broken, because our\nintellect knows the truth of the claim \u2018the harder object is not\nbroken by the touch of something soft that gives way before it\u2019\n(Ordinatio I.3.1.4.114\u2013115). Thus, in such a case, we\ncan discount the testimony of sight. Scotus makes a similar move\nregarding the apparent deception that occurs in dreams. In his view,\n\u201ca person can tell when his faculty is disposed and when it is\nnot\u201d, and thus he can tell whether he is asleep or dreaming\n(Ordinatio I.3.1.4.118\u2013120).\n4.2.2 Peter Auriol, William of Ockham, and Adam Wodeham\n\nPeter Auriol (1280\u20131322) and William of Ockham (1285\u20131347)\nwere contemporaries, though they took different paths both\nphilosophically and ecclesiastically. Auriol spent most of his time at\nthe University of Paris, and eventually became an Archbishop before\nhis untimely death. Ockham studied and taught at Oxford before being\nbrought up on charges of heresy by the papal court in Avignon; he\nspent the last years of his life excommunicated from the Church, after\nhaving fled to Munich. Though there is no evidence of the two having\never met, Ockham often argues against Auriol\u2019s views in some\ndetail. Adam Wodeham (ca. 1300\u20131358), who commented on both of\ntheir views, was the personal secretary of Ockham for a time, and\nworked at Oxford.\n\nAuriol\u2019s role in the history of skepticism is twofold, and he\nhas been discussed in this connection most recently by Tachau (1988),\nPerler (1994), and Denery (1998). First, he develops an account of\nintuitive cognition that raises the possibility of sensory illusion;\nsecond, he discusses particular cases of sensory illusion in some\ndetail in his Scriptum (prologue, q. 2 and d. 3, q. 14).\n\nHe begins by diverging from Scotus\u2019s account of cognition.\nScotus suggests that cognition of God, and cognition generally, can\noccur in one of two ways: either abstractively or intuitively.\nIntuitive cognition is meant to include a human\u2019s more-or-less\ndirect sensory experience of the external world. Abstractive\ncognition, on the other hand, is knowledge from a distance; it\nabstracts from the presence and existence of the thing, as when we\nremember a deceased acquaintance or perform astronomical calculations\nin a windowless room.\n\nAuriol agrees with much of Scotus\u2019s account of intuitive and\nabstractive cognition. Yet he imbues it with a psychological character\nthat is absent in the latter\u2019s work. For Auriol an intuitive\ncognition is had when one has the experience of something\nas if it is present and existent. It is even possible, in\nAuriol\u2019s view, to have such a cognition when the thing itself is\nabsent or non-existent. Auriol\u2019s abstractive cognition, on the\nother hand, does not involve this experience or feeling of\nsomething\u2019s presence and existence, even if the thing\nis both present and existent. For any given state of the\nextramental world, both abstractive and intuitive cognitions can\noccur. As a result, his position leaves him open to skeptical\nattack.\n\nHe realizes this possibility, and discusses many illusory experiences\nbefore developing a response. These illusory experiences include such\nstock examples as dreams, hallucinations, mirror images, the\nafter-images of the sun, the bent appearance of a straight stick that\nis immersed in water, and the apparent motion of trees experienced by\nthose traveling down a river. He also mentions such cases as the\ndouble image of a candle that appears when one\u2019s eyes are\ndistorted, the shimmering, changing appearance of colors on a\ndove\u2019s neck, and most interestingly, the fiery circle that\nappears when a burning stick is whirled rapidly through the air.\nThough Auriol\u2019s discussion stresses some experiences more than\nothers, his basic point is that failing to identify such events as\nintuitive cognitions amounts to the assertion that \u201call things\nthat appear, are\u201d (Scriptum 3.14.697).\n\nAuriol responds to these challenges by distinguishing between real\nbeing (esse reale) and apparent being (esse\napparens). This distinction has perplexed most readers of Auriol,\nand there is considerable disagreement about how to interpret it. Even\nso, it is generally agreed that real being is what the object has\nindependently of any perceiver, and also that whatever it is that is\nmeant by esse apparens, it is to be identified with a mental\nor sensory appearance of some sort. Some scholars (e.g., Tachau) read\nAuriol as a representationalist, which of course does little to solve\nthe skeptical problem; others (e.g., Perler) see him as a direct\nrealist. Whatever the answer in this particular case, Auriol is no\nskeptic. Not only does he believe that we can know external objects;\nwe also know many self-evident propositions with certainty (logical\ntruths, e.g.). For more on this aspect of Auriol\u2019s thought, see\nBolyard (2000).\n\nWilliam of Ockham considers Auriol\u2019s perceptual problems, but he\nconcludes that they are not a serious threat. On his view, our\nperceptual process (which occurs by means of intuitive cognitions) is\nsuch that it is infallible: for any such intuitive cognition, if it is\nof a thing that exists, we will know this fact, and if it is not, we\nwill know this as well. He holds this view even given the possibility\nthat God is deceiving us about such perceptions (e.g., by destroying\nthe object while maintaining the perception of it).\n\nAdam Wodeham disagrees with Ockham on this point; for him, there is no\nclear mark by which we can distinguish a true perception from a false\none in the case of a deceptive God. Nevertheless, he holds that our\nperceptual process is generally reliable despite these problems. For\nmore on Ockham and Wodeham, see especially Karger (2004), Panaccio and\nPich\u00e9 (2010), and Wood (2003); Adams (1987) and Tachau (1988)\nalso discuss their skeptical and anti-skeptical views.\n4.2.3 William Crathorn\n\nWilliam Crathorn (fl. 1330) was not considered by his contemporaries\nor later medieval commentators to be of the stature of such thinkers\nas Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, Scotus, or Ockham; still, his views give a\nwindow into some of the skeptical worries extant at the time. He\nworked at Oxford, flourishing in the generation after Scotus, and\nduring the time of Ockham. Tachau (1988) and Pasnau (1997) discuss his\nviews.\n\nIn his Questions on the First Book of Lombard\u2019s\nSentences, q.1, the Condemnation-inspired acknowledgment of\nGod\u2019s omnipotence generates and reinforces many skeptical\nproblems for Crathorn. In response, Crathorn uses God to bring himself\nback from the skeptical abyss. Though not as rhetorically compelling\nas Descartes\u2019 analogous moves in the Meditations, the\nphilosophical similarities among the two are striking.\n\nCrathorn also makes frequent appeal to God\u2019s omnipotence and\npower to deceive us\u2014nearly every page makes reference, directly\nor obliquely, to this possibility. A favorite non-epistemological\nexample he uses concerns heat and fire: God, he repeatedly says, has\nthe power to separate the heat from the fire that normally produces\nit. He also extends such divine powers to sensory cases. God, it\nseems, could maintain the vision of something even after that thing\nceases to exist. And as he tells us later, God\u2019s power to do\nthis is vast. Here, his example is that of the lighted, fiery circle\nwe see when a torch is rapidly twirled through the air at night:\n\n\u2026if God were to preserve in your head for a whole year that\ncircular color or another like it while no color existed externally,\nit would appear to you seeing that circular shape that you were seeing\nfor the whole year a flaming circle and the color of a circular shape\nexisting outside you\u2014when nevertheless there was no such thing.\n(Questions I.98\u201399)\n\n\nSimilar examples are used to show that we can be deceived in other\nways as well. Afterimages of colors can remain briefly after\nwe\u2019ve turned away from that which caused the initial color\nsensation. And it is within God\u2019s power both to preserve a\nsensible species of color after destroying the thing, and even to\ncreate such a sensible species even when no extramental thing ever\nexisted. And finally, he mentions dream skepticism. Unlike Scotus and\nmost others who discuss this problem, Crathorn explains a case in\nwhich one who is awake thinks he is dreaming.\n\nIt is here that Crathorn begins to move us out of our skeptical\nposition, by putting limits on God\u2019s power to deceive. First, he\nshows us cases in which God\u2019s power cannot extend to the\nlogically contradictory: even God, Crathorn says, cannot make a stone\nthink. Second, he agrees with Scotus that seeming claims (e.g.,\n\u2018I feel hot\u2019) and standard self-evident propositions\n(e.g., \u2018the whole is greater than its part\u2019) cannot be\ndoubted. Furthermore, he follows Augustine in arguing that this\ninference cannot be doubted: \u2018I doubt that I exist; therefore, I\nexist\u2019.\n\nFor more standard sensory skepticism, however, he combines the\napproaches offered by Henry and Scotus. By appealing to a self-evident\nproposition concerning God\u2019s goodness, Crathorn tells us, we can\nshow that external world skepticism is incoherent. A benevolent God\nwould not systematically deceive us in this way.\n4.2.4 Nicholas of Autrecourt and John Buridan\n\nNicholas of Autrecourt (ca. 1300\u2013ca. 1350) and John Buridan (ca.\n1295\u20131361) were contemporaries at the University of Paris. While\nBuridan maintained a good relationship with his ecclesiastical\nsuperiors, Nicholas did not: the latter\u2019s works were condemned\nand publicly burned. Of particular interest in what survives are two\nof his Letters to Bernard of Arezzo. Recent discussions of\nAutrecourt\u2019s views may be found in Beuchot (2003), Zupko (2003),\nand Grellard (2007).\n\nIn his First Letter, Autrecourt argues that Bernard\u2019s\nviews lead to an extreme form of skepticism. As he interprets the\nview, it would follow that intuitive cognitions cannot guarantee their\nown certitude: sensory illusions and the possibility of a deceptive\nGod preclude this. But he goes further. As he explains, \u201cyou\nmust say that you are not certain of your own acts, for example, that\nyou are seeing or hearing\u201d. Furthermore, \u201cyou are not\ncertain whether anything appears to you at all\u201d (First\nLetter 11). In short, one cannot be certain about any aspect of\nthe external world, including even its very existence. And as he goes\non to say, the existence of the past is equally uncertain, as is the\nvery existence of one\u2019s own mind.\n\nAutrecourt\u2019s Second Letter seeks to temper this\nskepticism, but only to a degree. According to him, the only things of\nwhich we can be certain are the principle of non-contradiction (i.e.,\n\u201cnothing both is and is not\u201d) and other propositions that\ncan be derived from this principle. He maintains a causal,\nproto-Humean skepticism about existential inferences: \u201cFrom the\nfact that some thing is known to be, it cannot be inferred evidently,\nby evidentness reduced to the first principle, or to the certitude of\nthe first principle, that there is some other thing\u201d (Second\nLetter 11). As he continues, he says that the only substance of\nwhich we can possess evident knowledge is his own soul\n\nNicholas of Autrecourt espoused the most radical form of skepticism\nfound at any point during the Middle Ages, and he was punished for it.\nBuridan, however, argues specifically against Autrecourt in his own\nworks.\n\nIn his Questions on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics II.1, for\ninstance, Buridan discusses various skeptical challenges, including\nsensory illusion, dream skepticism, skepticism about induction, and\nAutrecourt\u2019s causal skepticism. Again, the deceptive\npossibilities of an omnipotent God play a large role in his worries\nhere.\n\nIn response, Buridan takes a few different approaches. First, as with\nAutrecourt, Buridan holds the principle of non-contradiction to be\nundeniable, as is every proposition that can be derived from it. But\nhe also says that there is a \u201cvirtual infinity of self-evident\nprinciples through the senses, or through experience, or through the\ninclusion of terms without having to be proved by means of the first\nprinciple [i.e., non-contradiction]\u201d (Questions\nII.1.147, Klima trans.). In addition, Buridan drops his\nepistemological standards for sensory knowledge in general: because of\nthe possibility of God\u2019s deceptiveness, at best we are capable\nof \u201cconditional evidentness\u201d. Similar reductions in\nstandards occur in cases of induction, causation, etc. As he says,\nmathematical certainty is not expected in every subject. For more on\nBuridan and his broader intellectual context, see Zupko (2003),\nGrellard (2007), Lagerlund (2010b), and Karger (2010).\n5. Concluding Remarks\n\nMedieval Skepticism was not a movement. Rather, it was a series of\n(sometimes isolated) worries and responses to such skeptical problems\nas those outlined above. While some impetus for later discussions was\ngained from classical skeptical sources, for the most part medieval\nskepticism took its own path. Among the distinctly medieval additions\nto the debate were an emphasis on the certainty of self-knowledge, and\nespecially on a widespread recognition across traditions that\nGod\u2019s omnipotence, and thus the possibility of Divine deceit on\nthese grounds, provides a special challenge to the epistemology of\nanyone who holds a theistic worldview.\n\nThe fate of skepticism in the Renaissance and Early Modern Periods has\nbeen discussed widely, but connections between these later versions\nand those of their medieval antecedents have been less thoroughly\nstudied. Heider (2016) explores skeptical themes in the \u201cSecond\nScholasticism\u201d of the 16th and 17th centuries. Thinkers such as\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez, John Poinsot, and Francisco de Oviedo\ncontinue to treat the Scotistic/Auriolian/Ockhamist issue of the\nintuitive cognition of non-existent objects. They do not consider\nglobal skepticism a live threat, as Descartes does, and their accounts\nare thus closer to those of 13th and 14th century philosophers.\n\nFor an overview of the later history of the skepticism, with a focus\non canonical Early Modern philosophers, see Popkin (2003).",
