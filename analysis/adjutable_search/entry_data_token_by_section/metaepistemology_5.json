    "main_text": "Characterizations of epistemology || Belief-based and credence-based epistemology\n2.2 Belief-based and credence-based epistemology\n\nOne of the most significant divides in contemporary epistemology\nconcerns the granularity of the target psychological\nphenomena of interest: some projects in epistemology (e.g., the\ntraditional analysis of knowledge) make use primarily of\nbelief and its cognates (e.g., disbelief, and suspended\njudgment)\u2014all of which are comparatively coarse grained in\ncomparison with credences\u2014the target psychological\nphenomena of central interest to Bayesian epistemologists\u2014which\nare fine-grained and precise, and which represent a thinker\u2019s\nsubjective probability or confidence with respect to a\nproposition.\n\nA metaepistemological research question that has generated much\ndiscussion recently asks how we should understand the relationship\nbetween belief and credence within epistemology generally. Is either\nmore fundamental to answering questions of epistemological interest\nthan the other?\n\nOne trivial approach to resolving such questions is implied by those\nepistemologists who are eliminativists about either belief or\ncredence but not the other. For example, Richard Jeffrey (1970) and\nmore recently Richard Pettigrew (2016) affirm credences while denying\nthat beliefs exist (or at least express sympathy to denying this, in\nPettigrew\u2019s case); by contrast, Richard Holton (2008) takes the\nopposite position, affirming beliefs while denying that credences\nexist.\n\nThese eliminativist positions are the minority (for discussion see E.\nJackson 2020); more common are positions that either regard belief or\ncredence to be more fundamental than the other, or that neither is\nmore fundamental than the other (i.e., belief-credence\ndualism\u2014see Staffel 2019; Buchak 2014; E. Jackson\nforthcoming; Weisberg 2020). Non-eliminativists who deny dualism\ntypically defend either that (i) credence is a species of belief (or\ncan be explained in terms of or otherwise reduced to belief), or that\nbelief is a species of credence (or can be explained in terms of\notherwise reduced to credence). The former kind of position is usually\ndescribed as the \u201cbelief-first\u201d position (e.g., Moon &\nJackson 2020; Holton 2008; Easwaran 2016; Moon 2018; Carter, Jarvis,\n& Rubin 2016), the latter as the \u201ccredence-first\u201d\nposition (e.g., Wedgwood 2012; Greco 2015; Weatherson 2005; Lee &\nSilvia 2022).\n\nWhile it might be tempting to think that the\n\u201cbelief-first\u201d versus \u201ccredence-first\u201d debate\nis a proxy for a wider debate about whether the research agenda and\nquestions of mainstream epistemology are more fundamental than those\nof formal epistemology (e.g., Bayesianism), this inference would be\ntoo quick.\n\nFor example, as Scott Sturgeon (2020: 2) points out, the\ninformal/formal distinction, ostensibly a methodological distinction,\ndoes not line up neatly with the belief/credence distinction in\ngranularity. Although there is of course informal work in\nepistemology on coarse-grained attitudes (an example here is\ntraditional work on the Gettier problem and the JTB analysis of\nknowledge; see entry on\n the analysis of knowledge),\n there is also informal work in epistemology on fine-grained\nattitudes\u2014an example Sturgeon notes is Keith Lehrer\u2019s work\non comparative confidence. Likewise, some projects in epistemology use\nformal methods to explore the epistemology of belief (see, e.g.,\nPollock 1987) as well as, more typically, the epistemology of\ncredence.\n\nPutting this together, Sturgeon\u2019s contention is that a\ngranularity/methodology pairing in epistemology is misleading, and\nthat more accurate is a picture that makes room for four broad kinds\nof project-types in epistemology, which pair combinations of formal\nand informal methods with combinations of coarse-grained and\nfine-grained attitudes, as represented in the following 2\u00d72\nmatrix:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nCoarse-Grained\nFine-grained  \n\n\nInformal\nInformal work on belief and its revision (A)\nInformal work on rational confidence and its revision (B)\n\n\nFormal\nFormal work on rational belief and its revision (C)\nFormal work on rational confidence and its revision (D)\n \n\n\nTable 1 (Sturgeon 2020: 2)\n\n\nIf the epistemology of belief includes both informal (A) and formal\n(C) approaches, and the epistemology of credence also admits of formal\n(D) and informal approaches (B), we can envision how this might\ndifferently frame the \u201ccredence-first\u201d versus\n\u201cbelief-first\u201d debate described above. For one thing, this\nwider option space would invite us to ask whether (under the\ncredence-first slogan) we should think of cells B and D as more\nfundamental than work in cells A and C, or rather, just that work in\ncell D is more fundamental than work in cell A. Likewise, the wider\noption space invites us to consider whether (under the belief-first\nslogan) we should think of cells A and C as more fundamental than work\nin cells B and D, or rather, just that work in cell A is more\nfundamental than work in cell D.\n\nFurthermore, we might imagine an even further expansion of our 2x2\nmatrix to a 3x3 matrix. Consider that the above picture, divided four\nways, does not neatly make room for epistemological projects that\ncombine coarse-grained and fine-grained attitudes. One\nexample is Jennifer Lackey\u2019s (2000) approach to defeaters in\nepistemology\u2014in which a sufficientdegrees of confidence\nagainst the target proposition can undermine the justification one has\nfor believing the target proposition. Another example is\nSosa\u2019s approach to suspension of judgment (2021: Ch. 4), which\ncombines coarse-grained and fine-grained attitudes in the an\nevaluation of the quality of suspension of judgment. That is, for\nSosa, the quality of suspended judgment is sensitive to both\n(i) the competence by which you align your degrees of\nconfidence with your corresponding degrees of epistemic\nprobability, as well as (ii) the competence by which you judge or\nsuspend within the respective proper bounds of confidence.\nFinally, our table expands even more when we make room for cases of\nmixed methodology (formal and informal) to subject\nmatter that includes combinations of coarse-grained, fine-grained and\nmixed attitudes of interest.\n\nThese complications provide a useful perspective to revisit the\ninitial \u201ccredence-first\u201d versus \u201cbelief-first\u201d\nliterature. It suggests exercising caution in moving too quickly from\nclaims about whether credence or belief \u201creduce to\u201d or\n\u201care a species of\u201d the other, to more wide-reaching\nconclusions about whether one or the other\u2014or for that matter,\nthe kinds of methods and projects ordinarily associated with one or\nanother\u2014is of more fundamental epistemological interest.\n",
