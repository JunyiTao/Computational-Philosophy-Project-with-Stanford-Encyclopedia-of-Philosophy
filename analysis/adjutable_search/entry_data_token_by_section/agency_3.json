The standard conception\nis compatible with the claim that intentional actions are initiated\nby the agent, and proponents of the standard theory have argued that\ninitiation can be explained in terms of causation by the\nagent\u2019s mental states and events. According to desire-belief\nversions of the view, initiation by the agent consists in causation\nby the relevant desire-belief pairs (Goldman 1970; Davidson 1971;\nDretske 1988). According to more recent versions, initiation consists\nin causation by the relevant intentions (Brand 1984; Bratman 1987;\nBishop 1989; Mele 1992, 2003; En\u00e7 2003). Opponents of the\nstandard conception argue, however, that an agent\u2019s power to\ninitiate action cannot be reduced to the capacity to act\nintentionally and for reasons. They argue that the exercise of agency\nmay be entirely spontaneous, in the sense that an agent may initiate\nan action for no reason and without prior intent. On this view,\nreasons and intentions may have a strong and even a decisive\ninfluence on how an agent acts. But agency has its source in the\npower to initiate, and the exercise of this power cannot be reduced\nto the agent\u2019s being moved by reasons or intentions. This is an\nalternative conception of agency (Ginet 1990; O\u2019Connor\n2000; Lowe 2008; see also McCann 1998; for critical discussion see\nMele 2003: 38\u201351, 71\u201376; Clarke 2003:\n17\u201324). Proponents of this alternative conception reject the\nstandard theory and they reject, more generally, any account of\nagency in terms of causal relations between agent-involving states\nand events. According to some, the initiation of action consists in\nirreducible agent-causation, others appeal to uncaused mental acts of\nthe will. The main positions on this issue correspond to the main\npositions in the metaphysics of agency, to which we turn in\nsection 3.1.\n",
