    "main_text": "Nature || What Objects Do\n3.1 What Objects Do\n\nOne way to explain a thing or category is to mark out what it\ndoes\u2014its role. Since object is, on any view at all, a\nhighly abstract and general category, the relevant role by which\nobject might be defined must itself be highly abstract and\n general.[22]\n Three examples:\n\nFirst, various linguistic items, it seems, denote or refer.\n\u201cArmstrong\u201d denotes Armstrong, \u201credness\u201d\ndenotes redness, \u201cthe successor of zero\u201d denotes the\nnumber 1, and so on. Reflection on these platitudes brings to the fore\na role that we might call being an object of reference (or\nperhaps some related modal notion such as possibly being an object\nof reference or being eligible for reference).\n\nSecond, domains (classes or pluralities), it seems, are associated\nwith quantifiers (expressions like \u201csome\u201d and\n\u201cevery\u201d). \u201cEverything is so-and-so\u201d quantifies\nover all items within an inclusive domain (maximally inclusive, one\nthinks) and says of each of those items that it is so-and-so.\nReflection on these platitudes brings to the fore a role we might call\nbeing quantified over, or perhaps some related modal notion\nsuch as possibly being quantified over or being a\ncandidate for being quantified over.\n\nThird, some thoughts are, it seems, about things. The thought that\nAristotle was a philosopher is at least in part about a certain\nperson\u2014Aristotle. The thought that doing metaphysics is a fine\npastime is at least in part about a certain activity. And the thought\nthat Platonism is sensible is at least in part about a certain\nphilosophical theory. Reflection on these platitudes brings to the\nfore a role we might call being an object of thought or\nbeing thought of, or perhaps some related modal notion such\nas being possibly thought\n of.[23]\n\nThese three examples isolate highly abstract or general\nroles\u2014being an object of reference, being quantified over, or\nbeing thought of. These roles are specified, as it were, by form\nrather than content; the roles alone impose very few limitations or\nrequirements on the kinds of things that fill them. Plausibly, for\nexample, both concrete material objects and abstract propositions\nalike might satisfy any of these roles. These three examples involve\nroles specified in part by connection to thought or language. But\nthese connections may be severed. We might, for example, specify the\nobject role as being a bearer of properties (this would be a natural\nextension of the view discussed in 1.2.7, or a non-linguistic\nextension of the view discussed in 1.2.1).\n\nAnd each role suggests, in turn, a theory of what objects are: (i) to\nbe an object just is to be a referent, (ii) to be an object just is to\nbe quantified over, and (iii) to be an object just is to be an object\nof\n thought.[24]\n van Inwagen offers a version of (i) here (note the use of\n\u201ccan\u201d indicating that it is a modal role that\nobjects play, namely being possible referents; we here presuppose the\nalready mentioned tight connection between \u2018object\u2019 and\n\u2018thing\u2019):\n\n\nThe most general metaphysical category is the category\n\u201cthing\u201d. I use \u2018thing\u2019 as the most general\ncount-noun. Everything is a thing. A thing is anything that can be\nreferred to by a third-person singular pronoun\u2014as when I say,\n\u201cThe following is true of everything, that it is identical with\nitself.\u201d The category \u201cthing\u201d comprises everything\nthere is, everything that exists (for I take a stern anti-Meinongian\nline about non-existents: non-existents simply don\u2019t exist: the\nnumber of them is 0). (2007: 199)\n\n\nThese role-theoretic specifications of what it is to be an object will\nhave consequences with respect to the Extension Question and the\nContrast Question. If literally every thing at all is eligible for\nreference or quantification or thought, for example, then literally\nevery thing would be an object, a thesis in line with the Umbrella\nView. If, on the other hand, some items are not eligible for reference\nor quantification or thought, then such items would fall under\nnon-object, and the category object would turn out\nto have a contrast or complement. Similarly, if , say, both concrete\nmaterial objects, abstract propositions are eligible for reference or\nquantification or thought, then items of both sorts would fall under\nthe extension of\n object.[25]\n",
