    "main_text": "The Contemporary Republican Program || Republican Public Policy\n4.1 Republican Public Policy\n\nContemporary civic republicans aim to promote freedom, understood as\nindependence from arbitrary power. Roughly speaking, there are two\ndirections from which republican freedom might be threatened. First,\nthere is the obvious danger of an autocratic or despotic government\nassuming arbitrary powers over its subjects; this concern, and\nrepublican remedies for it, will be discussed below. But there is a\nsecond danger to republican freedom as well\u2014one that concerns\ncontemporary civic republicans just as much as the first. This is the\ndanger that some individuals or groups within civil society will\nsucceed in assuming arbitrary or uncontrolled powers over others.\nAbsent this second concern, republican policy would indeed often seem\n\u201cindeterminate,\u201d as observed by McMahon (2005)\u00a0and\nCosta (2007).\u00a0A few examples will help clarify this second\ndanger.\n\nImagine for a moment there were no system of domestic criminal and\ncivil law. In this case, citizens would not know where they stood with\none another; their interrelations would be governed simply by\nforce\u2014which is to say, by the arbitrary whim of the momentarily\nstronger party. In order to enjoy some degree of republican freedom,\ntherefore, it is absolutely essential to introduce a domestic legal\nsystem so as to govern the citizens\u2019 mutual relations (Lovett\n2016a). Notice that, on the republican view of freedom, the laws do\nnot merely protect some freedoms at the expense of others (as on the\nnon-interference view), but rather themselves actually introduce or\nenable that freedom. On this view, only when their interrelations are\nmutually governed by a system of public and stable rules is it\npossible for fellow citizens to enjoy some measure of independence\nfrom arbitrary rule (Pettit 1989, 1997, 2012; Spitz 1995; Viroli 2002;\nDagger 2009).\n\nThis connection between the rule of law and freedom is a common theme\nin the classical republican literature. Contemporary civic republicans\nobserve, however, that even when the rule of law is firmly\nestablished, there remain many other potential dangers of which the\nclassical republicans were less well aware. For example, while markets\nas such need not involve domination (Pettit 2006), and indeed when\nwell-ordered might reduce it (Taylor 2017), republicans\u2019\nenthusiasm for markets will have definite limits. Specifically, there\nis the danger of basic needs deprivation, which can place the least\nadvantaged members of society in a position of economic vulnerability\n(Spitz 1993; Pettit 1997; Viroli 2002). In order to satisfy their\nbasic needs, individuals may well submit themselves to the arbitrary\npower of exploitative employers or become dependent on the whims of\nvoluntary charity (Dagger 2006; Gourevitch 2015; O\u2019Shea 2019).\nEnsuring the enjoyment of republican freedom will therefore require\nsome public provision for otherwise unmet basic needs.\n\nYet another danger to republican freedom arises in the context of\nfamily life and gender relations. Traditional family law subjected\nboth wives and children to considerable arbitrary power: circumstances\nin the case of the latter, circumscribed opportunities in the case of\nthe former, ensured the nearly complete dependency of both on the\nfamily they happened to be in. The contemporary civic republican\nprogram is thus congenial to both an expansion of children\u2019s\nrights, and the elimination of sex domination (Pettit 1997; Phillips\n2000; Costa 2013; Halldenius 2015).\n\nIt is always important from a civic republican point of view to be on\nguard against the introduction of new forms of dependency and\narbitrary power through those very laws and policies designed to\nenhance individual freedom, however. In the area of criminal and civil\nlaw, for example, freedom might be threatened by legal uncertainty or\nprosecutorial discretion; and, of course, there are grave republican\nconcerns with respect to the existing system of punishment in many\nwestern nations (Braithwaite and Pettit 1990). These dangers might\nsuggest the need for a more democratized system of criminal justice\n(Mart\u00ed 2009). Similarly, in the public provision of basic\nneeds, there are republican concerns with respect to dependence on\ngovernment aid and arbitrariness in the distribution of benefits that\nmight point to the introduction of an unconditional basic income\n(Raventos 2007; Lovett 2010; for a contrary view, see Taylor 2017). In\nmany of these areas, however, there remains considerable work for\ncontemporary civic republicans in determining the appropriate public\npolicy implications of a universalized concern for republican\nfreedom.\n",
