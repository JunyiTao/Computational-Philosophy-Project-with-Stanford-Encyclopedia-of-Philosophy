    "main_text": "Pragmatic Theories of Explanation || Constructive Empiricism and the Pragmatic Theory of Explanation\n6.2 Constructive Empiricism and the Pragmatic Theory of Explanation\n\nOne of the most influential recent pragmatic accounts of explanation\nis associated with constructive\n empiricism.[12]\n This is the thesis, defended by Bas van Fraassen in his 1980 book,\nThe Scientific Image, that the aim of science (or at least\n\u201cpure\u201d science) is the construction of theories that are\n\u201cempirically adequate\u201d (that is, that yield a true or\ncorrect description of observables) and not, as scientific realists\nsuppose, theories that aim to tell literally true stories about\nunobservables. Relatedly, \u201cacceptance\u201d of a theory\ninvolves only the belief that it is empirically adequate (van Fraassen\n1980: 12). van Fraassen\u2019s account of explanation, which is laid\nout in several articles and, most fully, in Chapter Six of his book,\nis meant to fit with this overall conception of science: it is a\nconception according to which explanation per se is not an epistemic\naim of \u201cpure\u201d science (empirical adequacy is the only such\naim), but rather a \u201cpragmatic\u201d virtue, having to do with\nthe \u201capplication\u201d of science. (Note that the application\nof science is arguably a matter of pragmatics1. However,\nthe idea that explanation has to do with the application of science is\nused to motivate the adoption of a pragmatic2 theory of\nexplanation. We thus have an elision of the two notions of\n\u201cpragmatic\u201d distinguished above.) According to van\nFraassen, because explanation is a merely pragmatic virtue, a concern\nwith explanation is not something that can require scientists to move\nbeyond belief in the empirical adequacy of their theories to belief in\nthe literal truth of claims about unobservable entities.\n\nAccording to van Fraassen, explanations are answers to questions and\ngetting clear about the logic of questions is central to constructing\na theory of explanation. Questions can take many different forms, but\nwhen the question of interest is a \u201cwhy\u201d question,\nexplanatory queries will typically take the following form: a query\nabout why some explanandum \\(P_k\\) rather than any one of the members\nof a contrast class \\(X\\) (a set of possible alternatives to \\(P_k\\))\nobtained. In addition, some \u201crelevance relation\u201d \\(R\\) is\nassumed by the question. An answer \\(A\\) to this question\nwill take the form \u201c\\(P_k\\) in contrast to (the rest of) \\(X\\)\nbecause \\(A\\), where \\(A\\) bears the relevance relation \\(R\\) to\n\\([P_k,X]\\)\u201d. To use van Fraassen\u2019s example, consider\n\u201cWhy is this conductor warped?\u201d Depending on the context,\nthe intended contrast might have to with, e.g., why this particular\nconductor is warped in contrast to some other conductor that is\nunwarped. Alternatively, it might have to do with why this particular\nconductor is warped now when it was previously unwarped. The relevance\nrelation \\(R\\) similarly depends on the context and the information\nwhich the questioner is interested in obtaining. For example, \\(R\\)\nmight involve causal information (the question might be a request for\nwhat caused the warping) but it also might have to do with information\nabout function, if the context was one in which it is assumed that the\nshape of the conductor plays some functional role in a power station\nwhich the questioner wants to know about. Thus \u201ccontext\u201d\nenters into the explanation both by playing a role in specifying the\ncontrast class \\(X\\) and the relevance relation \\(R\\). van Fraassen\ndescribes various rules for the \u201cevaluation\u201d of answers.\nFor example, \\(P_k\\) and \\(A\\) must be true, the other members of the\ncontrast class must not be true, \\(A\\) must \u201cfavor\u201d (raise\nthe conditional probability of) \\(P_k\\) against alternatives, and\n\\(A\\) must compare favorably with other answers to the same question,\na condition which itself has several aspects including, for example,\nwhether \\(A\\) favors the topic more than these other answers and\nwhether \\(A\\) is screened off by other answers. However, he also makes\nit clear (as the example above suggests) that a variety of different\nrelevance relations may be appropriate depending on context and that\nthe evaluation of answers also depends on context. Moreover, he\nexplicitly denies that there is anything distinctive about the\ncategory of scientific explanation that has to do with its structure\nor form\u2014instead, a scientific explanation is simply an\nexplanation that makes use of information that is (or at least, is\ntreated as) grounded in a \u201cscientific\u201d theory.\n\nVan Fraassen sums up his view of explanation (and gestures at his\ngrounds for rejecting traditional objectivist approaches) as\nfollows:\n\n\nThe discussion of explanation went wrong at the very beginning when\nexplanation was conceived of as a relation like description: a\nrelation between a theory and a fact. Really, it is a three-term\nrelation between theory, fact, and context. No wonder that no single\nrelation between theory and fact ever managed to fit more than a few\nexamples! Being an explanation is essentially relative for an\nexplanation is an answer\u2026 it is evaluated\nvis-\u00e0-vis a question, which is a request for information. But\nexactly\u2026 what is requested differs from context to context.\n(1980: 156)\n\n\nVan Fraassen begins his chapter on explanation with a brief story that\nprovides a good point of entry into how he intends his account to\nwork. Recall from\n Section 2.5\n that a well-known counterexample to the DN model involves\nthe claim that one can explain the length S of the shadow cast\nby a flagpole in terms of the height H of the flagpole but that\n(supposedly) one cannot explain H in terms of S, despite\nthe fact that one can construct a DN derivation from S\nto H. This is commonly taken to show that the DN model\nhas left out some factor having to do with the directional or\nasymmetric features of explanation\u2014e.g., perhaps an asymmetry in\nthe relation between cause and effect that ought to be incorporated into\none\u2019s model of explanation. In van Fraassen\u2019s story, a\nstraightforward causal explanation of the usual sort of S in\nterms of H (although the object in question is a tower rather\nthan a flagpole) is first offered. Then a second explanation,\naccording to which the height of the tower is \u201cexplained\u201d\nby the fact that it was designed to cast a shadow of a certain length\nis advanced. Presumably the moral we are to draw is that as the\ncontext and perhaps the relevance relation R are varied,\nboth \n\n\\[ H \\text{ explains } S\\]\n\n\nand \n\n\\[ S \\text{ explains } H\\]\n\n\nare acceptable (legitimate, appropriate etc.) explanations. Moreover,\nsince these variations in context and relevance relation turn on\nvariations in what is of interest to the explainer and his audience,\nwe are further encouraged to conclude that explanatory asymmetries\nhave their source in psychological facts about people\u2019s\ninterests and background beliefs, rather than in, say, some asymmetry\nthat exits in nature independently of these. Pragmatists about\nexplanation think that a similar conclusion holds for other features\nof the explanatory relevance relation that philosophers have tried to\ncharacterize in terms of traditional models of explanation.\n\nOne obvious response to this claim, made by several critics (e.g.,\nKitcher & Salmon 1987: 317), is that the example does not really\ninvolve a case in which, depending on context, H causally\nexplains S and S causally explains H. Instead,\nalthough H does causally explain S, it is (something\nlike) the desire for a shadow of length S (rather than\nS itself) that explains (or at least causally explains) the\nheight (or the choice of height) for the tower. Or, if one prefers, in\nthe latter case we are given something like a functional explanation\n(but not a causal explanation) for the height of the tower, in the\nsense that we are told what the intended function of that choice of\nheight is. On either of these diagnoses, this will not be a case in\nwhich whether H provides a causal explanation of S or\nwhether instead S provides a causal explanation of H\nshifts depending on factors having to do with the interests of the\nspeaker or audience or other contextual factors. If so, the story\nabout the tower does not show that the asymmetry present in the\nflagpole example must be accounted for in terms of pragmatic factors.\nIt may be accounted for in some other way. In fact, although\ndiscussion must be beyond the scope of this entry, a number of\npossible candidates for such a non-pragmatic account of causal\nasymmetries have been proposed, both in philosophy and outside of it\n(for example, in the machine learning\n literature[13]).\n \n\nA much more general criticism has been advanced against van\nFraassen\u2019s version of a pragmatic theory by Kitcher and Salmon\n(1987). Basically, their complaint is that the relevance relation\nR in van Fraassen\u2019s account is completely unconstrained,\nwith the (in their view, obviously unacceptable) consequence that for\nany pair of true propositions P and A, answer A\nis relevant to P via some relevance relation and thus\n\u201cexplains\u201d P. For example, according to Salmon and\nKitcher, we might define a relationship of \u201castral\ninfluence\u201d \\(R^*\\), meeting van Fraassen\u2019s criteria for\nbeing a relevance relation, such that the time t of a\nperson\u2019s death is explained in terms of \\(R^*\\) and the position\nof various heavenly bodies at t. Here it may seem that van\nFraassen has a ready response. As noted above, on van Fraassen\u2019s\nview, background knowledge and, in the case of scientific explanation,\ncurrent scientific knowledge, helps to determine which are the\nacceptable relevance relations and acceptable answers to the questions\nposed in requests for explanation\u2014such knowledge and the\nexpectations that go along with it are part of the relevant context\nwhen one asks for an explanation of time of death. Obviously, astral\ninfluence is not an acceptable or legitimate relevance relation\naccording to modern science\u2014hence appeal to such a relation is\nnot countenanced as explanatory by van Fraassen\u2019s theory. More\ngenerally it might be argued that available scientific knowledge will\nprovide constraints on the relevance relations and answers that\nexclude the \u201canything goes\u201d worry raised by Salmon and\nKitcher\u2014at least insofar as the context is one in which a\n\u201cscientific explanation\u201d is sought.\n\nWhile this response may seem plausible enough as far as it goes, it\ndoes bring out the extent to which much of the work of distinguishing\nthe explanatory from the non-explanatory in van Fraassen\u2019s\naccount comes from a very general appeal to what is accepted as\nlegitimate background information in current science. Put differently,\nthis raises the worry that once one moves beyond van Fraassen\u2019s\nformal machinery concerning questions and answers (which van Fraassen\nhimself acknowledges is relatively unconstraining), one is left with\nan account according to which a scientific explanation is simply any\nexplanation employing claims from current science and a currently\nscientifically approved relevance relation. Even if otherwise\nunexceptionable, this proposal is, if not exactly trivial, at least\nrather deflationary\u2014it provides much less than many have hoped\nfor from a theory of explanation. In particular, in cases (of which\nthere are many examples) in which there is an ongoing argument or\ndispute in some area of science not about whether some proposed theory\nor model is true but rather about whether it explains some phenomenon,\nit is not easy to see how the proposal even purports to provide\nguidance. On the other hand, the obvious rejoinder that might be made\non van Fraassen\u2019s behalf is that no more ambitious treatment\nthat would satisfy the expectations associated with more traditional\naccounts of explanation (including a demarcation of candidate\nexplanations into those that are \u201ccorrect\u201d and\n\u201cincorrect\u201d) is possible\u2014a theory like van\nFraassen\u2019s is as good as it gets. If there is no defensible\ntheory of explanation embodying a non-trivially constraining relevance\nrelation, it cannot be a good criticism of van Fraassen\u2019s theory\nthat he fails to provide this.\n\nA final point that is suggested by van Fraassen\u2019s theory is\nthis: In considering pragmatic theories, it matters a great deal\nexactly where the \u201cpragmatic\u201d elements are claimed to\nenter into the account of explanation. One point at which such\nconsiderations seem clearly to enter is in the selection or\ncharacterization of what an audience wants explained. This is\nreflected in van Fraassen\u2019s theory in the choice of a \\(P_k\\)\nand an associated contrast class \\(X\\). Obviously, whether we are\nlooking for an explanation of why, say, this particular conductor is\nnow bent when it was previously straight or whether instead we want to\nknow why this conductor is bent while some other conductor is straight\nis a matter that depends on our interests. However, this particular\nsort of \u201cinterest relativity\u201d (and associated phenomena\nhaving to do with the role of contrastive focus in the\ncharacterization of explananda, which really just serve to specify\nmore exactly which particular explananda we want explained) seems\nsomething that can be readily acknowledged by traditional\n theories.[14]\n After all, it is not a threat to the DN or other models with\nsimilar traditional aspirations that one audience may be interested in\nan explanation of the photoelectric effect but not the deflection of\nstarlight by the sun and another audience may have the opposite\ninterests. What would be a threat to the DN and similar\nmodels would be an argument that once some explanandum E is\nfully specified, whether explanans M explains E (that\nis, whether there is an explanatory relation between M and\nE) is itself \u201cinterest-relative\u201d. It is natural to\ninterpret van Fraassen as making this latter claim, both in connection\nwith explanatory asymmetries and more generally.\n\nSelected Readings. van Fraassen (1980, especially\nChapter Six) and Achinstein (1983) are classic statements of pragmatic\napproaches to explanation. These pragmatic accounts are discussed and\ncriticized in Salmon (1989). van Fraassen\u2019s account is also\ndiscussed in Kitcher and Salmon (1987). De Regt and Dieks (2005) is a\nrecent defense of what the authors describe as a\n\u201ccontextual\u201d account of scientific understanding and which\nengages with some of the themes in the \u201cpragmatics of\nexplanation\u201d literature.\n",
