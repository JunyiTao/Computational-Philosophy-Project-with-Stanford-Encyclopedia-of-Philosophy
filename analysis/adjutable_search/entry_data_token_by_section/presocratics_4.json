    "main_text": "The Pythagorean Tradition\n5. The Pythagorean Tradition\n\nIn the last quarter of the sixth century, before Parmenides\u2019\nbirth, Pythagoras of Samos (an Aegean island) arrived in Croton, in\nsouthern Italy. He established a community of followers who adopted\nhis political views, which favored rule by the \u201cbetter\npeople,\u201d and also the way of life he recommended on what seem to\nhave been more or less philosophical bases. The traditional view has\nbeen that the aristocracy, the \u201cbetter people,\u201d generally\nmeant the rich. But Burkert notes that as early as the 4th\nc. BCE there were two traditions about Pythagoras, one that meshes\nwith the traditional view and associates Pythagoras with political\ntyrants, and another that credits him with rejecting tyrannies for\naristocracies that might not have been grounded in wealth (Burkert\n1972, 119). The Pythagorean Archytas (born late 5th\ncentury) lived in a democracy (Tarentum in southern Italy), and seems\nto have argued for fair and proportionate dealings between rich and\npoor (Huffman 2005). The Pythagorean way of life included adherence to\ncertain prescriptions including religious rites and dietary\nrestrictions (there is a general discussion in Kahn 2001). Detailed\ntreatment of Pythagoras and Pythagoreanism can be found in Zhmud (2012\nand 2013); an excellent collection of articles on Pythagoreanism is in\nHuffman (ed.) 2014. \n\nLike Socrates, Pythagoras wrote nothing himself, but had a great\ninfluence on those who followed him. He had a reputation for great\nlearning and wisdom (see Empedocles DKD31B129/LM22.D38, R43), although\nhe was treated satirically by both Xenophanes (DK21B7/LM8.D64) and\nHeraclitus (DK22B40/LM9D20, DKB129/LMD26). We do not know to what\nextent this included knowledge of mathematics, as would be suggested\nby the attribution to him of the famous Pythagorean theorem of\ngeometry (Rowett 2013). The details of Pythagoras\u2019 views are\nunclear, but he seems to have advocated the reincarnation of the soul\n(a novel idea among the Greeks, also developed in Orphic religion) and\nthe possibility of the transmigration of the human soul after death\ninto other animal forms. Pythagorean writers after his own time\nstressed the mathematical structure and order of the universe. This is\noften attributed directly to Pythagoras, but recent scholarship has\nshown that the evidence for attributing this mathematically-based\ncosmology to Pythagoras himself is convoluted and doubtful (Burkert\n1972, Huffman 1993 and 2005; but see Zhmud 1997). \n\nWhat seems clear is that the early Pythagoreans conceived of nature as\na structured system ordered by number (see the entry on\n  Pythagoras), and that such \npost-Parmenidean Pythagoreans as Philolaus\n(last half of the 5th century, more than a generation after\nPythagoras\u2019 death) and Archytas (late 5th to early\n4th century) held more complicated views about the relation\nbetween mathematics and cosmology than it is reasonable to suppose\nPythagoras himself could have advanced. The Pythagorean tradition thus\nincludes two strains. There are reports of a split in the period after\nPythagoras\u2019 death between what we would term the more\nphilosophically inclined Pythagoreans and others who primarily adopted\nthe Pythagorean ethical, religious and political attitudes. The\nlatter, called the acusmatici, followed the Pythagorean\nprecepts, or acusmata (which means \u201cthings\nheard\u201d). The former, the philosophical Pythagoreans (including\nPhilolaus and Archytas), were the so-called mathematici, and\nwhile they recognized that the acusmatici were indeed\nPythagoreans by virtue of accepting Pythagorean precepts, they claimed\nthat they themselves were the true followers of Pythagoras.\n\nPhilolaus of Croton seems to have blended the Pythagorean life with an\nawareness of and appreciation for the arguments of Parmenides (Huffman\n1993). According to Philolaus, \u201cNature in the cosmos was fitted\ntogether out of unlimiteds and limiters\u201d (DK44B1/LM12D2). These\nlimiters and unlimiteds play the role of Parmenidean basic\nrealities\u2014they are and unchangingly must be what they are, and\nso can be known; they are joined together in a harmonia (literally, a\ncarpenter\u2019s joint; metaphorically, a harmony), and \u201cit was\nnot possible for any of the things that are and are known by us to\ncome to be, without the existence of the being of things from which\nthe cosmos was put together\u201d (DK44B6/LM12D5, D14). The\nunlimiteds are unstructured stuffs and continua; the limiters impose\nstructure (shape, form, mathematical structure) on the unlimiteds.\nThings become knowable because they are structured in this way; the\nstructure can apparently be expressed in a numerical ratio that allows\nfor understanding: \u201cAll things that are known have number; for\nwithout this nothing whatever could possibly be thought of or\nknown\u201d (DK44B4/LMD7). Philolaus also developed a theory of the\ncosmos that displaced the earth from the center, replaced by what he\ncalled Hestia, the central fire (Graham 2013, 2014), and offered novel\naccounts of eclipses. \n",
