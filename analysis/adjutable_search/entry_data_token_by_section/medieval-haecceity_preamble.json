    "main_text": "\n\nFirst proposed by John Duns Scotus (1266\u20131308), a haecceity is a\nnon-qualitative property responsible for a substance\u2019s individuation\nand identity. As understood by Scotus, a haecceity is not a bare\nparticular underlying qualities. It is, rather, a\nnon-qualitative property of a substance or thing: it is a\n\u201cthisness\u201d (a haecceitas, from the Latin\nhaec, meaning \u201cthis\u201d) as opposed to a\n\u201cwhatness\u201d (a quidditas, from the Latin\nquid, meaning \u201cwhat\u201d) \u2013 akin to what are\nsometimes known in recent philosophy as \u201csuchnesses.\u201d The\norigins of the proposal have both philosophical and theological\ncomponents. In 1277, the Bishop of Paris, Stephen Tempier, condemned\nthe view that there could not be more than one angel in a given\nspecies. The condemned view was held by Christian Aristotelians in the\nthirteenth century \u2013 pre-eminently, Thomas Aquinas \u2013 and\noriginated in the claim that intra-specific individuation is in some\nsense through different lumps of matter. As immaterial substances,\nangels cannot be individuated in this way. And in any case, as\nimmaterial and non-spatial, angels seem to be good candidates for\npossibly lacking any kind of qualitative difference. Hence, as it is\npossible that two angels be exact replicas of each other, angels are\ngood cases for testing intuitions related to the identity of\nindiscernibles, and thus the question of individuation.\n",
