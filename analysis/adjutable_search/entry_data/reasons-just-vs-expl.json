Why is she selling her car?\nQuestions that ask for reasons, and in particular, reasons for action,\nare among the commonest questions humans have. Philosophers have\nsought to understand the nature of such reasons. Most contemporary\nphilosophers start by distinguishing two types of reason for action:\n\u201cnormative\u201d reasons\u2014that is, reasons which, very\nroughly, favour or justify an action, as judged by a well-informed,\nimpartial observer; and \u201cmotivating\u201d reasons\u2014which,\nagain roughly, are reasons the \u201cagent\u201d (that is, the\nperson acting) takes to favour and justify her action and that guides\nher in acting. But there are, in addition, \u201cexplanatory\u201d\nreasons, reasons that explain an action without necessarily justifying\nit and without being the reasons that motivated the agent.\n\nA clear understanding of reasons for action in their justifying,\nmotivating and explanatory functions is of relevance to the philosophy\nof action, to ethics, political philosophy and the philosophy of law.\nThe essential issues about reasons\u2014what they are, and how they\nrelate to human actions\u2014are of wider concern.\n\nThis entry examines the various accounts that philosophers have given\nof these different kinds of reasons and their interconnections, as\nwell as the disagreements among them about these matters. The focus\nwill be on reasons for acting\u2014what are commonly called\n\u201cpractical reasons\u201d, leaving aside questions that are\nspecific to other reasons, for instance, reasons for believing,\nwanting, feeling emotions, and having attitudes, such as hope or\nresentment.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Variety of Reasons\n\nHumans engage in practical reasoning: they deliberate about what to do\nand how to do it. And they often act in light of reasons which can\nthen explain their actions, and may also justify them.\nThese ideas go back to Plato (Protagoras and\nRepublic, Book 4) and Aristotle (De Anima, see esp.\nIII.10; see also Price 2011). They have been a constant theme in\ndiscussions of the character of human behaviour in the history of\nphilosophy. In the 18th century, David Hume and Immanuel\nKant offered radically different views about the role and importance\nof Reason (the faculty of reason) in guiding and justifying human\nactions. Their contributions remain influential today, but in the\nsecond half of the 20th century, the focus shifted from\ndiscussion of the faculty of reason to discussion of the very concept\nof a reason and to questions about different kinds of reasons and\ntheir interconnections.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, a distinction is commonly drawn in\ncontemporary debates between two kinds of reason:\n\u201cnormative\u201d and \u201cmotivating\u201d reasons. Jonathan\nDancy (2000: 20ff. and Appendix) discusses the history of this\ndistinction. It is sometimes said to date back to Francis Hutcheson\n(1730), though Dancy notes that the modern distinction does not\nclearly map on to earlier ones. Whatever its history, the distinction\nis now accepted by most if not all contemporary philosophers who write\non this topic (Raz 1975; Smith 1994; Parfit 1997; and Dancy 1995\nand 2000 are representative examples).\n\nA normative reason is a reason (for someone) to act\u2014in T. M.\nScanlon\u2019s phrase, \u201ca consideration that counts in favour\nof\u201d someone\u2019s acting in a certain way (1998 and 2004). A\nmotivating reason is a reason for which someone does something, a\nreason that, in the agent\u2019s eyes, counts in favour of her acting\nin a certain way. When an agent acts motivated by a reason, she acts\n\u201cin light of that reason\u201d and the reason will be a premise\nin the practical reasoning, if any, that leads to the action.\nMotivating reasons can also figure in explanations of actions that\ncite agents\u2019 reasons, what are called \u201creason\nexplanations\u201d of actions. Because of that, they are sometimes\ncalled \u201cexplanatory\u201d reasons, though we shall scrutinize\nthis description more carefully below.\n\nDancy suggests that the distinction between different types of reason\nis best understood as one between questions we can ask about them (a\nview that he finds also in Baier 1958):\n\n\nIf we do speak in this way, of motivating and normative reasons, this\nshould not be taken to suggest that there are two sorts of reason, the\nsort that motivate and the sort that are good. There are not. There\nare just two questions that we use the single notion of a reason to\nanswer. When I call a reason \u201cmotivating\u201d, all that I am\ndoing is issuing a reminder that the focus of our attention is on\nmatters of motivation, for the moment. When I call it\n\u201cnormative\u201d, again all that I am doing is stressing that\nwe are currently thinking about whether it is a good reason, one that\nfavours acting in the way proposed (Dancy 2000: 2\u20133).\n\n\nAccording to this suggestion, there is a single notion of a reason\nthat is used to answer different questions: the question whether there\nis a reason for someone to do something (normative) and the question\nwhat someone\u2019s reason for acting is (motivating). For instance,\nwe can ask whether there is a reason for the government of a country\nto tax sugary drinks (normative), and ask also for the\ngovernment\u2019s reason for actually taxing the drinks (motivating).\nThe same reason may answer both questions: the reason that favours\ntaxing the drink may be that the tax will help reduce child obesity;\nand that may also be the government\u2019s reason for taxing the\ndrinks. In that case, the government is motivated to tax drinks by a\nreason that there is for it to do so, the reason that may justify its\ndoing so. But we don\u2019t always act for the reasons that favour\nour actions. For instance, the government may tax sugary drinks\nbecause (or in part because) some of its members own shares in a\ncompany that sells low-sugar drinks. In that case, the reason for\nwhich the government decides to tax sugary drinks is not, or not\nsolely, the reason that favours its doing so. The distinction between\nnormative and motivating reasons, therefore, enables us to separate\nthe question what reasons motivate agents to act (a psychological\nquestion) and the question whether those are good reasons: reasons\nthat favour and justify their acting thus.\n\nIf this way of understanding talk about different kinds of reasons is\nright, perhaps the picture is more complex than the dichotomy of\n\u201cnormative vs. motivating\u201d suggests. For there seem to be\nat least three distinct questions about the relation between reasons\nand actions. There are questions about whether there is a reason that\nfavours someone\u2019s action; questions about what reason motivates\nsomeone to act; and also questions about what reasons explain his\naction. Consider the behaviour of Othello in Shakespeare\u2019s play\nof the same name. Othello kills Desdemona in the belief, induced by\nIago, that she has been unfaithful to him. The tragedy, however, is\nthat she has not: Desdemona is innocent, she loves Othello and is\nfaithful to him. Clearly, there is no reason that justifies the\nmurder: no normative reason. But there are two things we can say about\nOthello\u2019s reason for acting and his action. One is that Othello\nis motivated to kill Desdemona by the (putative) fact that Desdemona\nhas been unfaithful. The other is that we can explain his action of\nkilling her by citing the fact that he believes that Desdemona has\nbeen unfaithful. So here we seem to have two different reasons: one\nthat motivates\u2014the (putative) fact that Desdemona has been\nunfaithful; and one that explains\u2014the (actual) fact that Othello\nbelieves that she has. We can distinguish, then, between the reason\nthat explains Othello\u2019s action (the fact that he believes that\nDesdemona has been unfaithful) and the reason that motivates him to\nact (the alleged infidelity itself). It might be tempting to think\nthat Othello\u2019s motivating reason is just the fact that he\nbelieves that Desdemona has been unfaithful. We shall examine below\nreasons why the temptation should be resisted. Because of this, the\naccount that follows proceeds by dividing reasons for action initially\ninto two categories: normative and motivating-explanatory. It will\nthen present the case for treating motivating and explanatory reasons\nseparately.\n\nUntil relatively recently, the distinction between different kinds of\nreasons was assumed, whether explicitly or not, to imply that these\nreasons were things of different kinds. Normative reasons were\nconceived of as facts, and so were regarded as mind-independent: the facts\nare what they are independently of whether anyone knows them or thinks\nabout them. By contrast, motivating and explanatory reasons were\nconceived of as mental states of agents and, as such, as entities\nwhich depend on someone\u2019s thinking or believing certain things\n(Audi 2001 and Mele 2003 are representative examples\u2014but see\nalso Mele 2013). In recent years, however, this assumption has been\nchallenged, giving rise to a number of disputes about the ontology of\nreasons\u2014that is, disputes about what kind of thing or things\nreasons are. As we examine different kinds of reasons, we shall\nencounter some of these ontological debates. We start with normative\nreasons.\n2. Normative Reasons\n\nA reason is said to be a \u201cnormative reason\u201d for acting\nbecause it favours someone\u2019s acting. But what does it mean to\nsay that a reason \u201cfavours\u201d an action? One way of\nunderstanding this claim is in terms of justification: a reason\njustifies or makes it right for someone to act in a certain way. This\nis why normative reasons are also called \u201cjustifying\u201d\nreasons.\n\nThe term \u201cnormative reason\u201d derives from the idea that\nthere are norms, principles or codes that prescribe actions: they make\nit right or wrong to do certain things. To take a relatively trivial,\nculturally-determined example, the norms of etiquette in some\ncountries say that when meeting someone for the first time, the right\nthing to do is to shake hands, whereas in other countries, the right\nthing to do is to kiss them on both cheeks. So the fact that in the UK\nshaking hands is the norm of etiquette is a reason that makes it right\nto do so in the UK when you meet someone for the first time. There are\nmany other, often more important, norms, principles and values,\nimplicit or explicit, that make it right to do or not do certain\nthings. The existence of these norms or values depends on a variety of\nthings: logical and natural relations, conventions, rules and\nregulations, etc. And the norms or values may be moral, prudential,\nlegal, hedonic (relating to pleasure) or of some other kind. There are\nnormative reasons, therefore, corresponding to the variety of values\nand norms: normative reasons that are moral, prudential, legal,\nhedonic, etc.\n\nThe variety of norms or values that underpin normative reasons\nrequires some modification of the claim that reasons that favour\nactions make those actions right. If a reason favours my doing\nsomething, then I have a \u201cpro-tanto\u201d reason to do\nit: it is pro tanto (i.e., to that extent) right for me to do\nit. But there may be a reason against my doing it: a\npro-tanto reason not to do it. The fact that a joke is funny\nmay be a reason to tell it; but the fact that it\u2019ll embarrass\nsomeone may be a reason against doing so. In that case, I have a\npro-tanto reason to tell the joke and a different\npro-tanto reason not to tell it. Whether it would be right\nfor me to tell the joke, whether I have an\n\u201call-things-considered\u201d reason to tell it, will depend on\nwhether either of the reasons is stronger than the other. If so, that\nreason will override or \u201cdefeat\u201d the other reason. Only if\nthe pro-tanto reason for telling the joke is undefeated will\nit be right or justified all things considered for me to tell the\njoke.\n\nBut what sort of thing is a normative reason? What gives reasons their\nnormative force, so that they can make it right for someone to do\nsomething? And what determines whether there is such a reason and to\nwhom it applies? These and related questions have received much\nphilosophical attention in recent years.\n\nThere is consensus that normative reasons are facts (Raz 1975; Scanlon\n1998), though the consensus is not universal. The question is\ncomplicated by disagreement about what facts of any kind are: are they\nconcrete or abstract entities? Is a fact the same as the corresponding\ntrue proposition, or is the fact the \u201ctruth-maker\u201d of the\nproposition? Are there any facts other than empirical facts, e.g.,\nlogical, mathematical, moral or aesthetic facts? For instance, it has\nbeen argued, notably by John Mackie, that there are no moral facts.\nMackie argued against the existence of moral facts partially on the\ngrounds that they would be metaphysically \u201cqueer\u201d. He held\nthat, if there are any moral facts, they would have to be both\nobjective and necessarily motivating to those who are aware of them,\nand he claimed that it was wholly implausible that anything could have\nsuch properties (Mackie 1977). If Mackie is right that there are no\nmoral facts, then either moral reasons are not normative reasons; or\nat least some normative reasons namely, moral reasons, are not\nfacts.\n\nAmong those who hold that normative reasons are facts, some hold that\nfacts are true propositions and hence that reasons are also true\npropositions (Darwall 1983; Smith 1994; Scanlon 1998). Others reject\nthe idea that normative reasons could be true propositions; for\ninstance, Dancy (2000) does so on the grounds that propositions are\nabstract and representational (they represent the way the world is)\nbut reasons must be concrete and non-representational (they are ways\nthe world is). These problems are complex and have many ramifications\nbut we cannot and perhaps need not resolve them here because the view\nthat normative reasons are facts is generally meant to imply a very\nundemanding notion of facts. Thus Raz says that, \u201cwhen saying\nthat facts are reasons\u201d he is using the term \u201cfact\u201d\nto designate \n\n\nthat in virtue of which true or justified statements are true or\njustified. By \u201cfact\u201d is meant simply that which can be\ndesignated by the use of the operator \u201cthe fact that\n\u2026\u201d. (1975: 17\u201318)\n\n\nThere is less consensus about the basis of the normativity of\npractical reasons: the capacity of reasons to justify actions. On one\nproposal, the normativity of practical reasons depends on the\ngoodness, intrinsic or instrumental, of doing what there is reason to\ndo. This view is associated with Aristotle who, in the Nicomachean\nEthics, links what is right to do (what one has reason to do)\nwith what is conducive to the good (whether intrinsically or\ninstrumentally). The idea was prevalent among medieval philosophers,\nfor example Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologiae, 1a, q.82), and\nin the 20th century it was central to Elizabeth\nAnscombe\u2019s discussion of intentional actions (1957). Many\ncontemporary philosophers (e.g., Raz 1999 and Dancy 2000) have offered\naccounts of the normativity of reasons in line with this idea, so a\nreason is a normative reason to do something because it picks the\ngood-making features or value of the relevant action. As Raz puts it,\n\u201creasons are facts in virtue of which (\u2026) actions are\ngood in some respect and to some degree\u201d (1999: 23). There are\nother accounts that ground the normativity of reasons on the concept of\nrationality (e.g., Korsgaard 1996, who is influenced by Kant; and\nSmith 1994 and Gert 2004, who base their accounts on the concept of\nthe \u201cideally rational agent\u201d). A different proposal, which\nechos Hume\u2019s views about the relation between reason and\npassions, claims that the normativity of reasons is based on their\nrelation to our desires. Accordingly, what one has reason to do\ndepends ultimately on one\u2019s desires and motivations. Roughly,\nsomeone\u2019s having a reason to act requires their having some\nmotivation that would be served by acting in the way favoured by the\nputative reason. The motivation may be such things as desires, plans,\nlong-standing projects or values. And it may be something the agent\nactually has, or something she would have if she reasoned properly\nfrom her current motivations. Desire-based accounts of this sort have\nbeen defended recently by Williams 1979 and 1989, Schroeder 2008, and\nGoldman 2009.\n\nHowever we explain their normativity, normative reasons should be\ncapable of motivating agents to act\u2014though of course they may\noften fail to do so. Therefore, any account of normative reasons must\noffer a plausible explanation of the relationship between the\nnormativity of reasons and the capacity that reasons have to motivate\nagents to act. An account must explain how thinking that there is a\nreason for me to do something can motivate me to act, and to act\nfor that reason. Desire-based accounts of reasons might seem\nto have the edge here. If the reasons that apply to me depend on my\nantecedent motivations (desires, plans), then it is plausible that I\nshall be motivated to do what I believe will contribute to the\nsatisfaction or furthering of those motivations. But desire-based\naccounts fare less well in accommodating another central claim about\nnormative reasons. For it seems equally plausible that there are\nreasons (for instance, moral reasons) that apply to agents regardless\nof their motivations. Arguably, we all have reason to do what morality\ndictates, whether or not we are (or would be, if we reasoned\nconsistently from our current motivations), motivated by those\nreasons. (For a detailed discussion of these issues, see the entry on\n reasons for action: internal vs. external.)\n\nThe claim that something is a normative reason for action is generally\nthought to be a \u201crelational\u201d claim: it establishes a\nrelation between a fact, an agent, and an action kind. The relation is\nthat of \u201cbeing a reason for\u201d (see Raz 1975 and 1998, Dancy\n2004, Cuneo 2007). For example, the fact that a person has ingested a\nlethal poison may be a reason for the paramedics to give the person an\nantidote. According to some, the relation involves not just a person,\na reason and an action, but more aspects: a time, circumstances, etc.\n(Skorupski 2010 and Scanlon 2014). This relational view of reasons\ngives a minimal sense in which claims about normative reasons are\n\u201cagent-relative\u201d: they relate agents to reasons (a more\nsubstantial sense is developed in Nagel 1970 and 1986 and discussed in\nthe entry\n reasons for action: agent-neutral vs. agent-relative).\n But even in the minimal sense, the agent-relativity of reasons raises\nquestions about the conditions that determine when a reason for acting\napplies to a particular agent. One such question, mentioned in the\nprevious paragraph, is whether the reasons that apply to you depend on\nyour desires and motivations. Another question is whether they depend\non your knowledge and beliefs. To go back to the example of Othello:\non the one hand it seems clear that Othello has no reason to kill\nDesdemona, and the reason he thinks he has\u2014that she is\nunfaithful\u2014is no reason at all. On the other hand, it might seem\nthat Othello does have a reason, for he believes that Desdemona is\nunfaithful and believes, moreover, that his reputation has been\ndamaged and needs to be restored with her death. And those beliefs\nappear to give him a reason to do what he does, at least from his\nperspective.\n\nPhilosophers disagree about how to reconcile these competing claims.\nOne way of resolving the tension between them is to say that Othello\nhas no normative reason to kill Desdemona but has a\nmotivating reason: viz., the falsehood he believes. Smith\n(1994) and Dancy (2000) both offer suggestions of this sort (though\nSmith calls Othello\u2019s beliefs \u201chis normative\nreasons\u201d). Others, e.g., Schroeder (2008), talk about\n\u201cobjective\u201d and \u201csubjective\u201d normative\nreasons, so that Othello would have a subjective normative reason but\nno objective normative reason to kill Desdemona. These positions are\nall \u201cobjectivist\u201d in that they presuppose that whether an\nagent has an (objective) normative reason to act depends solely on the\nfacts and not on the agent\u2019s beliefs (see Williams 1979).\n\u201cPerspectivists\u201d take a different view. They claim that\nwhether someone has a normative reason to do something is not\nindependent of her perspective, which includes her beliefs (see Fantl\nand McGrath 2009 and Gibbons 2010). Certain cases of ignorance and\nmistake help to bring out their view. A much discussed case introduced\nby Williams (1979) concerns an agent, call him Sam, who orders a gin\nand tonic and, when served a glass with a liquid that looks like gin\nand tonic, forms the belief that it is gin and tonic, when in fact the\nglass contains petrol and ice. Does Sam have a normative reason to\ndrink what\u2019s in the glass? The objectivists say that the answer\ndepends solely on the facts, so Sam has no normative reason to drink\nthe liquid. Perspectivists, by contrast, say that given Sam\u2019s\nperspective, which includes a reasonable (though false) belief that\nthe liquid is gin and tonic, Sam does have a normative reason to drink\nwhat\u2019s in the glass.\n\nPerspectivists tend to defend their position by reference to\nconsiderations of rationality. Agents are often in situations in which\nthey don\u2019t know all the relevant facts. And yet, perspectivists\nsay, these agents often do what is reasonable or rational for them to\ndo, given their perspective. If, as seems plausible, one acts\nrationally when one acts for reasons that make it rational for one to\nso act, then perspectivism must be right: agents who act in error or\nignorance often act rationally and, when they do, they act for reasons\nthey have to do what they do. In short, as perspectivism says, the\nnormative reasons an agent has depend in an important sense on his\nepistemic perspective, and so an agent can have a normative reason\nthat is a false belief. Similar arguments are articulated in relation\nto justification (though often questions about rationality and\njustification are run together). Surely, the argument goes, what an\nagent is justified in doing depends on whether he has reasons that\njustify his doing that thing. But, again, there are cases where an\nagent would surely be justified in doing something even though there\nare conclusive reasons against doing it; and he would be justified\nprecisely because he doesn\u2019t know about those reasons. For\nexample, the fact that the cake is poisoned is a conclusive reason not\nto offer it to your guests. But you might be justified in offering it\nto them, the perspectivist says, if you don\u2019t know about the\npoison. So considerations about the justification of action also seem\nto support perspectivism because they show that what reasons you have\ndepends on your perspective.\n\nThere are several moves that an opponent of perspectivism can make in\nresponse here. She can concede that an agent who acts according to his\nepistemic perspective but guided by a false belief acts rationally,\nbut deny that acting rationally requires that the agent act for\nnormative reasons. Instead, the objectivist may say, acting rationally\nonly requires acting in a way that is consistent with one\u2019s\nbeliefs, so long as these are themselves rational. This response could\nrely on, e.g., Derek Parfit\u2019s conception of rationality, which\nrequires acting guided by one\u2019s real or apparent reasons (Parfit\n2001, an \u201capparent reason\u201d is a falsehood that an agent\nbelieves to be true, and treats as a normative reason but which is not\na normative reason; see also Kolodny 2005). As for the justification\nof action, the objectivist can deny that the actions of agents who act\nin ignorance or guided by a mistaken belief are justified. Whether the\naction is justified, the objectivist will say, depends purely on\nwhether the facts make it the right thing to do, and not on the\nagent\u2019s beliefs. So in the cake example above, the action of\noffering the poisoned cake to his guests is not justified: there is no\nnormative reason that makes it the right thing to do. And that is so\nregardless of what the agent knows or believes. A different question,\nthe objectivist will say, is whether an agent who does something wrong\nbecause of his false beliefs or ignorance is himself justified and/or\nblameworthy for so acting. If our host\u2019s ignorance about the\npoison is not culpable, he will most likely not be blameworthy and the\nagent may be justified. But in saying this, the objectivist need not\nbe conceding that the action was justified, i.e., done for a\nnormative reason, only that the host may be exculpated for doing the\nwrong thing. As Austin noted (1957), we must distinguish between a\njustification and an excuse. When accused of wrongdoing, one may offer\na justification, which aims to show that in fact the thing done was\nright because there was reason for doing it. Alternatively, one may\noffer an excuse: admit that one did the wrong thing but plead to be\npartly or wholly exculpated\u2014for instance, because it was done\nout of ignorance or mistake. (There are other excuses, such as\naccidents or coercion but those need not concern us here.) To return\nto the cake example, our agent might be excused for doing the wrong\nthing (poisoning the guests) if he was non-culpably ignorant about the\npoison. By contrast, it might be possible to give a justification for\npoisoning the guests: for instance, that they were in fact some\npsychopaths intent on causing his family mortal harm. If so, poisoning\nthem with the cake may have been the right thing to do and, depending\non whether our agent was aware of the relevant facts and acted guided\nby them, it may be that he was justified in poisoning them.\nThis example shows how questions about normative reasons bear directly\non the justification of agents, as distinct from the justification of\ntheir actions, by raising questions about motivating reasons, to which\nwe now turn.\n3. Motivating and Explanatory Reasons\n\nIt was suggested above that although reasons are traditionally divided\ninto two kinds: normative and motivating/explanatory, there may be a\ncase for distinguishing between motivating reasons and explanatory\nreasons. The basis for doing so was said to be the existence of three\ndistinct questions about reasons: whether a reason favours an\naction; whether a reason motivates an agent; and whether a\nreason explains an agent\u2019s action. Accordingly, the\nthought goes, we should recognise three kinds of reasons: normative,\nmotivating and explanatory. This way of classifying reasons is\nexplicitly accepted and/or defended by various authors (Baier 1958;\nAlvarez 2007, 2009a, 2010; Hieronymi 2011); and it is hinted at, using\ndifferent terminology, by others (Smith 1994; Darwall 2003; Mantel\n2014).\n\nThis three-part classification may seem excessively refined: is it\nreally necessary or advantageous to distinguish motivating and\nexplanatory reasons? After all, a motivating reason can always explain\nthe action that it motivates, so the question of what reason motivates\nan agent and what reason explains her action are, one might think,\nfundamentally the same. If so, \u201cmotivating\u201d and\n\u201cexplanatory\u201d are surely just different labels for the\nsame kind of reason, at least in contexts of intentional actions. And\nthere appears to be no obvious advantage in regarding motivating and\nexplanatory reasons as distinct kinds.\n\nThese considerations against a three-part classification of reasons,\nthough plausible, are not decisive. First, the fact that the same\nreason can answer different questions does not show that the questions\nare not importantly different and, consequently that the reasons that\nanswer those questions are not of different kinds. We saw that to be\nso for normative and motivating reasons: the same reason can answer a\nquestion about motivation and one about justification. And yet, that\ndoes not blur the difference between those questions, nor does it\nundermine the importance of recognising the corresponding two kinds of\nreasons. So the same may be true for motivating and explanatory\nreasons.\n\nSecond, even if the same reason sometimes answers the two questions\nabout motivation and explanation, this is not always so. Although a\nreason that motivates an action can always explain it, a reason that\ncan explain the action is not always the reason that motivates it. For\nexample, that he is jealous is a reason that explains why Othello\nkills Desdemona. But that is not the reason that motivates him to kill\nher. This example may appear not to be to the point because an\nexplanation that refers to his jealousy is not a\nrationalisation of Othello\u2019s action: it doesn\u2019t\nexplain his action by citing his reason. That is right and\nyet the example still shows that not all reasons that explain by\nciting psychological factors, e.g., jealousy, are reasons that\nmotivate. Moreover, knowing that Othello acted out of jealousy gives\nan indication of Othello\u2019s reason (Desdemona\u2019s suspected\nunfaithfulness) and yet the reason of jealousy is not Othello\u2019s\nmotivating reason. Besides, the explaining and motivating reasons may\ndiffer even in cases where the reason that explains makes reference to\nthe reason that motivates. For suppose that John punches Peter because\nhe finds out that Peter has betrayed him. The fact that John knows\nthat Peter has betrayed him is a reason that explains John\u2019s\naction. This is an explanatory reason. But that fact about\nJohn\u2019s mental state of knowledge is not the reason for which\nJohn punches Peter. That reason is a fact about Peter, namely that he\nhas betrayed John. That is the reason that motivates John to punch\nPeter\u2014his motivating reason. So in this case we have two\ndifferent (though related) reasons: that Peter has betrayed John and\nthat John knows that Peter has betrayed him, which play different\nroles. One reason motivates John to punch Peter (the betrayal); and\nthe other explains why he does it (the knowledge of the betrayal). To\nbe sure, the latter reason explains by reference to the former.\nNonetheless, these are different reasons that answer different questions about\nmotivation and explanation, respectively.\n\nBut isn\u2019t this distinction superficial? After all, the fact that\nmotivates John, i.e., that Peter has betrayed him, can also explain\nJohn\u2019s action\u2014we need not cite John\u2019s knowledge of\nthis fact. As we shall see below\n (3.2),\n this is controversial: some philosophers think that all reason\nexplanations require reference to psychological states of the agent.\nBe that as it may, consider a different example. The fact that Othello\nbelieves that Desdemona is unfaithful explains why he kills her. But\nthe fact that he believes in her infidelity is not the reason in light\nof which he kills her, the reason that, in his eyes, favours killing\nher. What he takes to favour killing her is the (putative) fact that\nshe is unfaithful. Again, these are importantly different reasons: for\nit can be the case that Othello believes that Desdemona is unfaithful\nwithout it being the case that she is, and vice versa.\nMoreover, since Desdemona is not unfaithful, that putative fact cannot\nbe what explains Othello\u2019s action because something that is not\nthe case cannot explain anything\u2014though, as we shall see below\n(also\n 3.2),\n this view of explanation has proved controversial too.\n\nThe intricacies of these controversies suggest that it may indeed be\nhelpful to keep apart questions of motivation and questions of\nexplanation even when we are dealing with reason explanations of\naction. The advantages of drawing this distinction will be spelled out\nin examining debates concerning motivating reasons and the explanation\nof action. We shall see there that apparently competing claims about\nmotivating reasons and the explanation of action are often best\nunderstood and resolved as claims about motivating or explanatory\nreasons, respectively. The following passage, in which Stephen Darwall\ncomments on a putative disagreement between Dancy and Michael Smith,\nhelps to illustrate the point of the distinction:\n\n\n\u201cMotivating reason\u201d in Dancy\u2019s pen means the\nagent\u2019s reason, the (believed, putative) fact in light of which\nthe agent acted. Smith, however, uses \u201cthe agent\u2019s\nnormative reason\u201d to refer to this and \u201cmotivating\nreason\u201d to refer to the desire/belief combination necessary to\nexplain behavior teleologically. (Darwall 2003: 442\u20133)\n\n\nUsing the terminology introduced above, we can reframe Darwall\u2019s\npoint as follows. When Dancy says that reasons are (putative) facts\nthat agents take to favour their actions, he is talking about\nmotivating reasons. By contrast, when Smith says that reasons are\ncombinations of mental states of believing and desiring, he is talking\nabout explanatory reasons. So Dancy and Smith may not be disagreeing\nbut, rather, using the same term, \u201cmotivating reason\u201d for\ntwo different concepts: Dancy is using it to refer to the reasons in\nlight of which an agent acts, while Smith is using it to refer to the\nreasons that explain an agent\u2019s act.\n\nOne of the most intensely debated issues concerning both motivating\nand explanatory reasons is their ontology: what kind of thing are\nthese reasons? The philosophical literature of the last half of the\n20th century was premised on the more or less explicit\nassumption that motivating and explanatory reasons, which at the time\nwere not normally explicitly distinguished, were psychological\nentities, in particular, mental states of agents, such as\nOthello\u2019s believing that Desdemona is unfaithful to him. This\nview of the ontology of reasons is often called \u201cPsychologism\u201d.\nThat consensus began to dissolve at the turn of the century and\npsychologism came under sustained attack. Opposition to it is\nvariously labelled \u201cnon-psychologism\u201d,\n\u201cexternalism\u201d and \u201cobjectivism\u201d. The last two\nlabels are also used for a variety of other philosophical views so, to\navoid confusion, I will stick with the term\n\u201cNon-psychologism\u201d.\n\nDonald Davidson\u2019s 1963 paper, \u201cActions, Reasons, and\nCauses\u201d is often cited as the locus classicus of\npsychologism. In that paper he characterises a reason as follows:\n\n\nC1. R is a primary reason why an agent performed the action\nA under the description d only if R consists of a\npro attitude of the agent toward actions with a certain property, and\na belief of the agent that A, under the description d,\nhas that property. (1963: 687)\n\n\nA primary reason is a combination of two mental states: a pro-attitude\nand a belief. These \u201cprimary reasons\u201d are, in effect,\nexplanatory reasons: reasons that explain actions. Davidson defended\nthe \u201cdesire-belief\u201d model of action explanation, according\nto which reasons are states of believing and desiring that explain\nactions because they cause them. This model is at the centre of\nDavidson\u2019s account of intentional action, which he characterises\nas an event caused \u201cin the right way\u201d by a primary reason.\nDavidson\u2019s paper was highly influential; as a result,\npsychologism became the dominant view for both motivating and\nexplanatory reasons, which, as noted above, were then not explicitly\ndistinguished.\n\nPsychologism is very appealing. For it seems right that when an agent\nacts for a reason, he acts motivated by an end that he desires (an end\ntowards which he has a \u201cpro-attitude\u201d) and guided by a\nbelief about how to achieve that end. Because of this, it is possible\nto explain his action by citing his desiring and his believing the\nrelevant things. To return to our example, we can explain why Othello\nkills Desdemona by citing his wanting to defend his honour and his\nbelieving that, given that Desdemona has been unfaithful, killing her\nis the only way to do so. And this sort of explanation in terms of\nstates of belief and desire supports the relevant counterfactuals: had\nOthello not believed that she had been unfaithful or had he not\nbelieved that killing her was the only way to defend his honour, he\nwouldn\u2019t have killed her, even if he had still wanted to restore\nhis reputation; and had he not cared about his reputation, he\nwouldn\u2019t have killed her, despite his beliefs about her betrayal\nand what was necessary to defend his honour. This sort of\nconsideration led to widespread acceptance of the view that\nexplanatory reasons are mental states and, since the latter were not\ndistinguished from motivating reasons, it also led to the view that\nmotivating reasons are mental states.\n\nAmong psychologists, some say that motivating and explanatory reasons\nare mental or psychological facts, rather than mental states.\nThis is because psychologism holds that reasons are mental states such\nas \u201can agent\u2019s believing (or wanting, or knowing)\nsomething\u201d, and it is easy to move from the claim that\nsomeone\u2019s reason is his believing something (a mental\nstate) to the claim that his reason is that he believes\nsomething (a psychological fact). For instance, it is easy to move\nfrom saying that Joe\u2019s reason for running is his believing that\nhe\u2019s late (a mental state) to saying that Joe\u2019s reason is\n(the fact) that he believes that he\u2019s late.\n\nThese defenders of psychologism do not on the face of it disagree with\nchampions of non-psychologism about the ontology of these reasons. For\npsychological facts are not themselves mental states, though they are\nfacts about mental states. But they still disagree with non-psychologists about\nwhat these reasons are. Because of this, we need a way to\ndistinguish between psychologism and non-psychologism other than in terms of\nontology\u2014the kind of thing that each camp says reasons\nare\u2014in order to capture the deeper disagreement between them.\nPerhaps a better way to do so is to say that psychologism holds that\nmotivating and explanatory reasons are mental states or facts about\nmental states of agents, whereas non-psychologism says that\nmotivating and explanatory reasons, like normative reasons, are facts\nabout all sorts of things, including mental states of agents.\n\nThe following sections examine current debates about psychologism, and\nother issues, concerning motivating and explanatory reasons. It\ndoes so separately for reasons of each kind, as that will facilitate\nclarity in the various debates. We start with motivating reasons.\n3.1 Motivating Reasons\n\nThe term \u201cmotivating reason\u201d is a semi-technical\nphilosophical term. As we saw above, the phrase is now generally used\nin the literature to refer to a reason that the agent takes to favour\nher action, and in light of which she acts. Motivating reasons are\nalso considerations that can figure as premises in the practical\nreasoning, if any, that leads to action. The terms \u201cagential\nreason\u201d, \u201cthe agent\u2019s normative reason\u201d,\n\u201csubjective (normative) reasons\u201d, \u201cthe agent\u2019s\noperative reason\u201d and \u201cpossessed reasons\u201d are\nsometimes also used to capture this notion of a reason. Because the\nconcept is somewhat technical, further clarification is needed.\n\nFirst, the current use of the term excludes some otherwise plausible\ncandidates from being motivating reasons. For instance,\nsomeone\u2019s goal or intention in acting, which is something the\nagent desires (to grow vegetables; to kill Desdemona) seem to be\nmotivating factors in acting. But because these are not considerations\nin light of which one acts, they do not fall under the category\n\u201cmotivating reasons\u201d as currently understood (but see Audi\n1993). Similarly, a state of desiring (wanting to have one\u2019s\nrevenge), or a motive or emotion (for instance, jealousy) can be\nstates \u201cthat encompass motivation\u201d, to use Mele\u2019s\nphrase, 2003: if one is in any such a mental state, one is thereby\nmotivated to act. But again, these are not motivating reasons in the\nsense at issue because they are not considerations that the agent\ntakes to favour acting. Moreover, many hold that states of desiring\nare often grounded in considerations about the goodness or value of\nwhat is desired\u2014a view defended by Anscombe 1957, Nagel 1970,\nQuinn 1993, Raz 1999, and Schueler 2003, among others. When this is\nso, the motivating reasons both for wanting and for acting accordingly\nare the considerations about the goodness or rightness of what is\ndesired. To continue with our example, Othello\u2019s desire to kill\nDesdemona is grounded in the thoughts that she is unfaithful to him\nand that killing her is a fitting way to restore his reputation (even\nif the desire is intensified by his jealousy). These considerations\nare his reason for wanting to kill her and his reason for doing so. In\nshort, what Othello desires (to kill Desdemona), his goal (to redress\nher betrayal), his state of desiring those things, or his motive\n(jealousy) are things that motivate him to kill Desdemona but they are\nnot his motivating reasons in the semi-technical sense of the phrase\nstipulated above. His motivating reasons, if we agree he has any, are,\nrather, the putative facts that she is unfaithful to him and that\nkilling her is a fitting way to restore his reputation.\n\nSecond, talk of an agent\u2019s motivating reason, or of \u201cthe\nagent\u2019s reason\u201d, always involves some simplification.\nIt\u2019s a simplification because an agent may be motivated to act\nby more than one reason: I may hoover the house early in the morning\nboth because I won\u2019t have time to do it later and because it\nwill annoy my inconsiderate neighbour. Moreover, a fact will seem a\nreason for me to act only in combination with other facts: that I\nwon\u2019t have time to hoover later will seem a reason to do it now\nonly if the house needs hovering. So my reason is, arguably, a\ncombination of at least two facts: that the house needs hovering and\nthat I won\u2019t be able to do it later. Finally, I may consider a\nfact that counts against acting, for instance, that hoovering early\nwill also disturb my other neighbour, who is very considerate. If I\nstill decide to hoover, I do not act for that \u201ccon-reason\u201d\nbut, arguably, I am still guided by it if I give it some weight in my\ndeliberation (see Ruben 2009 for a discussion of\n\u201ccon-reasons\u201d).\n\nSince motivating reasons are considerations that an agent takes to\nfavour acting, and since the reasons that favour acting are facts, it\nmight seem that motivating reasons are also facts or at least putative\nfacts, rather than mental states. However, the view that they are\nmental states was, as noted earlier, the dominant view till the turn\nof the 20th century, and it is still very popular today. A\nseemingly compelling argument for adopting psychologism for motivating\nreasons is the following. For a reason to motivate you it must be a\nreason you have. This does not require that the reason should\ngenuinely apply to you. But it requires that you \u201cpossess\u201d\nthe reason: you must know or believe the consideration that\nconstitutes the reason. And this appears to support the view that\nreasons are mental states of agents, or facts about those states. The\nopponent of psychologism about motivating reasons can respond by\nnoting that, while it is true that, for it to motivate you to act, you\nmust know or believe the thing that constitutes a reason, that\ndoesn\u2019t imply that the reason that motivates you is your knowing\nor believing what you do. Rather your reason is what is known or\nbelieved: a (putative) fact. To put the point differently, motivating\nreasons are the contents of mental states but not mental states\nthemselves. This argument about motivating reasons is not, therefore,\ndecisive for psychologism. And in fact, there are several compelling\narguments against psychologism.\n\nA very influential argument, found in Dancy 1995 and 2000, focuses on\nthe relation between normative and motivating reasons. The argument\nhinges on Dancy\u2019s claim that any account of motivating reasons\nmust meet what he calls \u201cthe normative constraint\u201d:\n\n\nThis [normative constraint] requires that a motivating reason, that in\nthe light of which one acts, must be the sort of thing that is capable\nof being among the reasons in favour of so acting; it must, in this\nsense, be possible to act for a good reason. (2000: 103)\n\n\nDancy\u2019s charge against psychologism about motivating reasons is\nthat it fails to meet the constraint because, if psychologism is\nright, we can never act for a good reason. Why? In order to act for a\ngood reason, we need to act for a reason that is or could be a fact.\nHowever, according to psychologism, motivating reasons are mental\nstates. If so, the reasons for which we act are mental states, and not\nfacts. If, by contrast, motivating reasons were, say facts and\nputative facts, then some of the reasons for which we act would be\nfacts, and it would follow that we can, and sometimes do, act for a\ngood reason. But in saying that motivating reasons are mental states,\npsychologism eliminates this possibility, for a mental state can never\nbe a fact. As Dancy puts it, psychologism has the consequence that\n\u201cthe reasons why we act can never be among the reasons in favour\nof acting\u201d (2000: 105). The argument relies on the\n\u201cidentity thesis\u201d about reasons: the thesis that you act\nfor a good reason, only if your motivating reason is identical to the\nnormative reason that favours your action (see Heuer 2004 for a\nhelpful explanation).\n\nDancy (2000: 106ff.) considers a possible response: that acting for a\ngood reason may simply require your motivating reason to be a mental\nstate whose content is a good reason. So, you act for a good reason if\nyour motivating reason for, say, taking your umbrella is your\nbelieving that it is raining, which is a mental state whose\ncontent\u2014\u201cit is raining\u201d\u2014is a good reason to\ntake your umbrella. The success of this response to Dancy\u2019s\nargument is unclear. On the one hand, if the response is that the\nreasons that motivate us are the contents of our mental\nstates of believing, this meets the normative constraint but it does\nnot favour psychologism. It meets the normative constraint because the\ncontent is the fact that it is raining and that is a good\nreason. But this interpretation amounts to abandoning psychologism\nbecause the contents of mental states are not themselves mental\nstates. On the other hand, the response might be just the assertion\nthat a mental state with the right content can be a good reason for\nacting. But this does not seem so much a response to Dancy\u2019s\nargument as a refusal to engage with it. For it remains unclear how,\naccording to this response, we can ever act for a good (i.e., a\nnormative) reason (but see Mantel 2014 for an attempt to develop the\nobjection by rejecting the identity thesis).\n\nThis brings us to another, related argument against psychologism,\nwhich is simply that consideration of what agents take their reasons\nfor acting to be, and of what they typically give and accept as their\nreasons for acting, count against psychologism. Thus, as Othello\nconsiders what to do, even while in the grip of his jealousy, his\nreasoning does not include considerations about whether he believes\nthis or that but rather considerations about what Desdemona has or has\nnot done. The things that Othello considers, then, are not his mental\nstates but rather facts, or alleged facts, about the world around him,\nin particular about Desdemona. This argument is reinforced by\nconsidering that motivating reasons are the reasons that would figure\nas premises in a reconstruction of the agent\u2019s practical\nreasoning, if any. Again, these premises are sometimes considerations\nto the effect that one believes this or that; but much more often,\nthey are considerations about the world, about the value or goodness\nof things and people around us, the means of achieving those things,\netc. In short, although practical reasoning sometimes includes\npsychological facts about oneself among its premises, much more often\nthese premises refer to (perceived or real) facts about the world\nbeyond our minds.\n\nThese arguments lend substantial support to non-psychologism and\nsuggest that being motivated by a reason is not acting in light of, or\nguided by, a mental state, or by a fact about one\u2019s mental\nstates. Along with other arguments, they have led many philosophers (see Alvarez 2008, 2009b, 2010; Bittner 2001; Dancy 2000, 2008; Hornsby 2007, 2008: Hyman 1999, 2015;\nMcDowell 2013; Raz 1999; Schueler 2003; Stout 1996; Stoutland 1998;\nWilliamson 2000, among others) to reject psychologism. But non-psychologism is not free from difficulties. A central problem for non-psychologism is presented by\n\u201cerror cases\u201d. If motivating reasons are facts, then\nwhat is the agent\u2019s reason in cases, like\nOthello\u2019s, where the agent is in error and is motivated to act\nby a false consideration? In such a case, what the agent would give as\nhis reason\u2014say, that Desdemona has been unfaithful\u2014is\nfalse. So, Othello cannot act in light of the fact that Desdemona has\nbeen unfaithful. And non-psychologism does not seem to have a ready\nanswer to what the motivating reason is in these cases.\n\nNon-psychologists have offered different proposals to accommodate\nerror cases. One proposal is to say that in error cases agents act for\na reason that is a falsehood that the agent believes. So, in the\nexample above, Othello\u2019s reason is his false belief about\nDesdemona. Note\u2014not his believing that she\u2019s unfaithful,\nwhich would bring us back to psychologism, but his false belief (the\ncontent). According to this proposal, then, Othello did act for a\nreason: a false belief, which is a putative fact that the agent takes\nto be a fact. The view is defended or at least endorsed by many, among\nothers: Dancy (2000, 2008, 2014), Hornsby (2007, 2008), McDowell\n(2013), Schroeder (2008), Setiya (2007), and Comesa\u00f1a and\nMcGrath (2014). Jennifer Hornsby defends the view in the process of\noffering a disjunctive conception of a reason for acting, analogous to\nMcDowell\u2019s \u201cdisjunctive conception of appearances\u201d\n(Hornsby 2008: 251), summarized in the following passage:\n\n\nWe now have the two answers to the question What is a reason for\nacting? Reasons for acting are given when facts are\nstated: let us call these \u201c(F)-type reasons\u201d. Reasons for\nacting are given when it is said what an agent believes: let\nus call these \u201c(B)-type reasons\u201d. (2008: 247)\n\n\nThis response to problem of error cases is plausible but there are\nalso considerations against it. One such consideration is that stating\nthese alleged reasons often leads to paradox or infelicitous claims.\nFor many would argue that a claim such as \u201cEllie\u2019s reason\nfor stepping on your toes is that you are stepping on her toes,\nalthough you are not stepping on her toes\u201d is paradoxical. By\ncontrast, there is no air of paradox whatsoever in the corresponding\nclaim about Ellie\u2019s beliefs: \u201cEllie believes that\nyou\u2019re stepping on her toes although you are not\u201d. Thus,\nUnger writes: \n\n\nit is inconsistent to say \u201cHis reason was that the store was\ngoing to close, but it wasn\u2019t going to close\u201d. (1975: 208)\n\n\nIf this is right, then the operator \u201cher reason is that\n\u2026\u201d, unlike \u201cher belief is that \u2026\u201d is\nfactive: the truth of the propositions expressed by sentences formed\nwith \u201cher reason is that\u2026\u201d requires the truth of\nthe proposition expressed with the \u201cthat\u201d clause. This\nresponse to the error cases\u2014that a reason can be a\nfalsehood\u2014is therefore problematic.\n\nA related difficulty is that this view commits one to awkward claims\nabout reasons, such as Dancy\u2019s claim that one\u2019s reason for\nacting may be \u201ca reason that is no reason\u201d (Dancy 2000: 3;\nhe qualifies this with the parenthesis \u201cno good reason, that\nis\u201d), or Hornsby\u2019s claim that sometimes it is the case\nthat \u201cthere was no reason to do what he did, even though he did\nit for a reason\u201d (Hornsby 2008: 249; though again, she clarifies\nthat the first clause denies that there is an \u201cF-type\u201d\nreason, a fact, while the second asserts that the agent had a\n\u201cB-type\u201d). The awkwardness of these claims is further\nsupported by considerations about usage, for it seems that claims\nabout what someone\u2019s reason is are often retracted and qualified\non learning that the person was mistaken concerning what he or she\nbelieved. If I say that Lisa\u2019s reason for attending the party is\nthat James will be there, and you tell me that he won\u2019t be at\nthe party, it would sound paradoxical if I insist that her reason is\nthat James will be at the party.\n\nThe fact that these claims about reasons are prima facie\nparadoxical or infelicitous is not a decisive argument against the\nviews that generate them, but it has led some non-psychologists to\noffer alternative accounts of error cases. One such alternative says\nthat, in error cases, an agent acts on something that he treats as a\nreason and in light of which he acts but which is in fact not a\nreason. So, in these cases an agent acts for an \u201capparent\nreason\u201d (Alvarez 2010 and Williamson forthcoming). The view is\nalso defended by Parfit, who characterizes apparent reasons as\nfollows: \u201cWe have some apparent reason when we have some belief\nwhose truth would give us that reason\u201d (2001: 25). On this view,\nan apparent motivating reason is not merely a bad reason but simply\nnot a reason. So according to this alternative, agents who act on\nfalse beliefs are motivated by something, a false belief. They treat\nthat belief as a reason and are guided by it in acting. Nonetheless,\nthat false belief is not a motivating reason because it is not a fact,\nbut merely an apparent fact, and hence only an apparent reason.\n\nIt might appear that the difference between these two\nnon-psychological alternatives boils down to just a terminological\ndispute: some philosophers choose to call these false beliefs\n\u201cfalse\u201d, \u201csubjective\u201d, or \u201cbad\nreasons\u201d, etc., while others choose to call them \u201capparent\nreasons\u201d. Surely, the thought would go, terminology is a matter\nof choice and nothing of substance depends on this choice. What\nmatters is that every proposal contains clear definitions of how terms\nare being used. A response would be that some terminological choices\nare more apt than others because they reflect a more nuanced or\nprecise understanding of the relevant concept. The substantial issue\nbehind this debate seems to be whether the notion of a reason we apply\nin different contexts is a unified notion. If it is, the choice\nbetween the alternative non-psychological views outlined in the\nprevious paragraphs will depend largely on what features are taken to\nbe essential to that notion.\n\nWe noted above that most if not all accounts of acting for a\nmotivating reason require as a condition that the agent be in some\nkind of epistemic relation to the reason that motivates her. And we\nsaw also that a widespread view is that this epistemic relation is one\nof belief: for an agent to act for the reason that p, the agent must\nbelieve that p. It is this thought that led many to endorse the view\nthat reasons are mental states (often as part of the\n\u201cdesire-belief\u201d conception of reasons for action described\nabove). But the view that mere belief is not sufficient to act for a\nreason has gained popularity in recent years. And many have argued\nthat, in order to act in light of a fact that is a reason, an agent needs to\n know the relevant fact. The view is explicitly\ndefended by Unger (1975), Hyman (1999, 2011 and 2015), Williamson\n(2000 and forthcoming), Hornsby (2007 and 2008 (as part of her\ndisjunctive conception mentioned above)), and McDowell\n(2013)\u2014but many others also endorse it. The basic idea behind\nthis position is that an agent may act on the basis of a belief merely\nby treating that belief (i.e., what she believes) as a reason for\nacting. However, if there is a fact in virtue of which her belief is\ntrue, then she acts in light of that fact, or is guided by that fact,\nonly if she knows that fact. If the agent does not know the fact, we\ncannot say that she was guided by it (Hyman), or that she was\nresponding rationally to it (McDowell). If the agent does not know the\nfact, the argument goes, the relationship between the agent\u2019s\nacting as she did and the fact is fortuitous, a matter of luck or\ncoincidence, and hence not sufficient for the fact to be her reason\nfor acting. And this, they argue, is so even in cases where an agent\nacts motivated by a belief that is both true and justified. For just\nas Gettier (1963) showed that having a justified true belief is not\nsufficient for having knowledge of the corresponding fact, so, these\nauthors argue, acting on a justified true belief is not enough for\nacting in light of the corresponding fact: the connection between the\nfact and the action is fortuitous. (See entries on\n the analysis of knowledge\n and\n epistemology\n for discussions of Gettier\u2019s arguments).\n\nThose who think that acting for a reason requires merely treating\nsomething one believes as a ground, e.g., using it as a premise in\none\u2019s reasoning, reject this characterisation of acting for a\nreason\u2014Dancy (2011 and 2014) is an example. But defenders of the\nknowledge condition complain that Dancy\u2019s remarks are\noff-target. For their point is that there is a notion of acting for a\nreason\u2014arguably, the central notion\u2014that involves the idea\nof acting guided by a fact. This notion requires not mere belief but\nknowledge of the fact that is a reason. Others have argued that it is,\nhowever, possible to accept that there is this distinctive, central\nnotion of acting for a reason but still deny that an agent needs to\nknow a fact in order to act guided by it. Dustin Locke (2015), for\nexample, argues that it is possible for someone to act guided by a\nfact that he does not know. Locke uses so-called\n\u201cfake-barn\u201d cases to make his point against the knowledge\ncondition. These cases are due to Alvin Goldman (1967) who developed\nthem in his defence of his theory of knowledge. Suppose that a man is\ndriving in the countryside and sees a barn. Unbeknown to him,\nhe\u2019s driving in \u201cfake-barn country\u201d, which is\nlittered with fake barns: barn fa\u00e7ades designed to look like\nreal barns. The widely held consensus is that a person in a fake-barn\nsituation who, on seeing a real barn, forms the belief that there is a\nbarn, does not know that there is a barn, even though he has a\njustified true belief to that effect. Locke uses this sort of case to\nargue that a person in this situation could, for instance, drive\ntowards a barn guided by the fact that there is a barn over there,\nwithout knowing that there is. If so, Locke claims, the agent acts for\nthe reason that there is a barn over there, since he is guided by that\nfact. Nonetheless, he doesn\u2019t know that there is a barn. (For\nfurther discussion of practical reasoning, the knowledge condition and\nfake-barn situations see Hawthorne 2004, Brown 2008 and Neta\n2009.)\n\nThese debates about motivating reasons focus primarily on what sort of\nthing motivating reasons are and what it takes for an agent to act for\na reason. We now turn to when and how reasons explain actions.\n3.2 Explanatory Reasons\n\nA person\u2019s action may be explained in a variety of ways: by\nreference to the agent\u2019s goal, or habits, or character traits,\nor to her reasons for acting. For instance, we may say that Jess went\nto the hospital in order to reassure her father, or that she went\nbecause she always goes on Tuesdays, or because she is a dutiful\ndaughter, or because her father was in intensive care. These\nstatements explain why Jess went to the hospital because, given\ncertain background assumptions, they enable a third person to\nunderstand Jess\u2019s action: they make it intelligible. In the\nexamples just given, the first explanation gives us Jess\u2019s goal\nin going to the hospital (to reassure her father), the second and\nthird place her action in the context of her habits (she does it every\nTuesday) and her character (she\u2019s dutiful), respectively, and\nthe fourth explanation gives a reason why she did it that was\nher reason for doing it: a reason that, from her perspective,\nspoke in favour of going to the hospital (that her father was in\nintensive care). Among this variety of possible explanations (and\nthere are more), the last one is a distinctive type that is of\nparticular interest here because it is an explanation of an\nintentional action that rationalises the action: it explains the\naction by citing the agent\u2019s reason for acting. In\nDavidson\u2019s words:\n\n\nA reason rationalizes an action only if it leads us to see something\nthe agent saw, or thought he saw, in his action\u2014some feature,\nconsequence, or aspect of the action the agent wanted, desired,\nprized, held dear, thought dutiful, beneficial, obligatory, or\nagreeable. (Davidson 1963: 685)\n\n\nOne argument in favour of psychologism for explanatory reasons that\nrationalise actions depends on the following idea. For a reason to be\nable to rationalise your action, that reason must be part of your\npsychology: a fact that is merely \u201cout there\u201d cannot\nexplain why you do anything. Your believing or knowing that fact, by\ncontrast, can explain why you act. So the reasons that explain your\nactions must be mental states (believings, knowings, etc.).\n\nIt might be responded that, although a fact cannot be a reason that\nexplains one\u2019s action unless the person is aware of it, it does\nnot follow that the explanation of the action must mention their\nawareness of the reason. For instance, we can explain why\nJess went to the hospital by citing her reason for going, namely that\nher father had been admitted to the intensive care unit\u2014this\npoints to something she saw in the action that made it desirable:\ne.g., that she could then be with her father in this difficult moment.\nThe explanation does not need to mention any psychological fact, such\nas the fact that she knew that her father had been admitted, even\nthough the explanation presupposes this fact. Against this suggestion,\na defender of psychologism for explanatory reasons might urge that\nthese explanations are elliptical and when fully spelled out their\nexplanans (the part of the explanation that does the explaining)\ncontains facts about what she knew or believed. But are these\nexplanations really elliptical? It seems undeniable that a person\ncannot act for the reason that p, or on the grounds that p, unless she\nstands in some epistemic relation to p: she needs to believe, know,\naccept, etc. that p. However, it does not follow that all full\nrationalisations need mention psychological facts and that, when they\ndon\u2019t, this is because they\u2019ve been given in elliptical\nform. Perhaps the fact that the agent knows the relevant things is\nsimply a necessary condition for her reason to be the explanans in a\nreason explanation. Or as Dancy suggests, her knowing or believing may be an\n\u201cenabling condition\u201d for the explanation (Dancy 2000:\n127).\n\nHowever that issue about rationalisations is decided, two things\nshould be noted. First, in \u201cerror cases\u201d\u2014cases when\nan agent acts on the basis of a falsehood that he believes and treats\nas a reason for acting\u2014the explanans of a true explanation must\nbe a psychological fact. For instance, the explanation of why Othello\nkills Desdemona cannot be what he believes, that Desdemona has been\nunfaithful, but rather the fact that he believes it. This is because\nexplanations are, it is generally thought, factive: a true explanation cannot have a falsehood as its explanans: we cannot say that Othello kills Desdemona because\nshe has been unfaithful when she hasn\u2019t. The second thing to\nnote is that, even if psychologism is right for explanatory reasons\n(that is, even if all reason explanations cite psychological facts),\nit does not follow that psychologism is right for motivating reasons\nbecause these reasons need not be the same. In other words, if one\nattends to the distinction between the roles of motivation and\nexplanation that reasons can play, there should be no temptation to\nmove from psychologism concerning explanatory reasons in some or in\nall cases, to psychologism concerning motivating reasons.\n\nNot all opponents of psychologism accept the suggestion that\nexplanatory reasons in rationalisations are mental states, or facts\nabout them, even for error cases. For example, in his 2000 book, Dancy\ndenies this and argues that we can always explain an action by\nspecifying the reason for which it was done, even when an agent acted\non a false consideration. The problem with this view is that it\ncommits Dancy to the conclusion that some reason explanations are\nnon-factive: an explanation may be true even though what does the\nexplaining is not. For instance, it commits him to saying that what\nexplains why I took my umbrella is that it was raining, even though it\nwas not raining. To most philosophers this is an unacceptable\nconclusion: surely true explanations require the truth of both the\nexplanandum (what is explained: that I took my umbrella) and the\nexplanans (that it was raining). In a recent paper (2014), Dancy has\nabandoned his earlier view that reason explanations can be non-factive\nbut he still retains his opposition to psychologism for explanatory\nreasons. So he still maintains that we can always explain an action by\nspecifying the reason for which it was done, even when the\n\u201creason\u201d is some falsehood that the agent believed and in\nlight of which he acted. In those cases, he says,\n\n\nwe can say that what explains the action is that it was done for the\nreason that p, without committing ourselves to saying that\nwhat explains the action is that p. (2014: 90)\n\n\nHe adds that in such cases the reason itself \u201cneed not be the\ncase and does not make the sort of distinct contribution to the\nexplanation that would enable us to think of it as the\nexplanans\u201d (2014: 91). Philosophers may disagree about whether\nthis new suggestion is satisfactory. Some may think that\n\u201cOthello killed Desdemona for the reason that Desdemona had been\nunfaithful to him, although she had not been unfaithful to him\u201d\nsounds paradoxical. Moreover, to say that the reason that explains an\naction is (the fact) that it was done for the reason that p\nenables Dancy to accommodate the view that explanations are factive.\nBut it does so at the expense of undermining his claim that the\nreasons that explain are also the reasons that motivate. For Dancy\nsays that the reason that motivates Othello is that Desdemona is\nunfaithful, while, according to this new suggestion, the reason that\nexplains his action (i.e., the explanans) is that it was done for\nthe reason that she is unfaithful.\n\nWhatever one thinks about Dancy\u2019s new proposal it is worth\nemphasizing again that the distinction between explanatory and\nmotivating reasons enables one to bypass these issues. For one can say\nthat the reason that explains why Othello kills Desdemona is the\npsychological fact that he believes that she has been unfaithful\nwithout accepting that that is the reason that motivates him. His\nmotivating reason for killing her is the putative fact that she has\nbeen unfaithful (which, as we saw above, some would describe as merely\nan apparent reason). In short, even if some form of psychologism is\nright for explanatory reasons, it does not follow that it is right for\nmotivating reasons: the two may differ from each other in some\ncases.\n4. Conclusion\n\nSpace limitations preclude detailed examination of other debates about\npractical reasons. We shall close the entry with a\nbrief description of a relatively new debate about reasons for action\nthat derives from work in the social sciences. The debate relates to\nwork in experimental psychology (some of it dating from the 1970s,\ne.g., Nisbett and Wilson 1977) that claims to identify our \u201creal\nreasons\u201d for acting. Briefly, experiments have shown that\nfactors such as the way items are presented in a situation of choice\ninfluence people\u2019s choices without their being aware of this\ninfluence. For example, in some of these experiments, when faced with\na choice among what in fact are identical options, agents tend to\nchoose the item on the right. This appears to be in fact the result of\na right-hand bias in most humans. However, since people are not aware\nof this bias, when asked to justify their choice, agents cite reasons\nconcerning some alleged superior feature of their chosen option. These\nand other phenomena, such as implicit bias (which occurs when agents\ndisplay bias based on race, gender, etc. in their behaviour, while\nexplicitly denying that they endorse such bias) and others, seem to show that agents\nare motivated by reasons they are not aware of, and in ways that they are not aware of, even\nafter careful reflection on their reasons and motivations. The general\nclaim, then, is that these phenomena undermine many of our ordinary\nand philosophical assumptions about our reasons for acting, for they\nshow, it is said, that agents are often ignorant of their real reasons\nfor acting, and as a result they often \u201cconfabulate\u201d when\nexplaining and attempting to justify their behaviour (see Hirstein\n2009). These conclusions, if right, would appear to threaten\nfundamentally the authority we seem to enjoy about our own reasons for\nacting, as well as the explanatory power of the ordinary explanations\nof action that cite the agent\u2019s reasons for acting.\n\nThe plausibility of these conclusions depends to a large extent on\nwhether the notion of \u201cthe agent\u2019s real reason\u201d that\nthese studies claim to uncover is the same as the notion of a\nmotivating reason that has been examined in this entry. One suggestion\nmight be that these so-called \u201creal reasons\u201d are\nexplanatory but not motivating reasons. And, it has been argued that,\nwhile these explanatory reasons might make important contributions to\nexplaining our actions, in a variety of ways, this fact is compatible\nwith our ordinary psychological explanations in terms of agents\u2019\nmotivating reasons. For instance, it may be that the sorts of reasons\nuncovered by these experiments help explain why agents are motivated\nby the reasons that they avow are their reasons for acting: the\nprevalence of a right-hand bias in most humans may explain why the\nitem on the right seems more appealing to an agent. But this is\nconsistent with the truth of the agent\u2019s claim that her reason\nfor choosing the item is the (putative) fact that it is better than the other items\n(see Sandis 2015 for\nsuggestions along these lines).\n \nThe above is an overview of a range of\nproblems about practical reasons and their widespread significance. It\nshould be sufficient to show how the problems and their many\nramifications reach into many aspects of our lives and have important\nconsequences for our understanding of ourselves as rational\nagents.\n",
