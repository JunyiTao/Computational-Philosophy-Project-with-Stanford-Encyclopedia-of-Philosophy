    "main_text": "Theories of Desire || Attention-Based Theories of Desire\n1.4 Attention-Based Theories of Desire\n\n\nAnother evaluatively loaded theory of desire has been proposed by\nT.M. Scanlon. Dubbed a theory of desire in the\n\u2018directed-attention\u2019 sense, this theory links desires to\nreasons, rather than goodness. But the theory does so through its\ncharacterization of how desire plays its most important role, which is\nits role in directing the attention of the subject who desires.\n\n  For an organism to desire p is for the thought of\n  p to keep occurring to the organism in a favorable light, so\n  that its attention is directed insistently toward considerations that\n  present themselves as counting in favor of p.\n\n  \n\n\nSince, on Scanlon's view, reasons are considerations that\ncount in favor of propositions, it follows from this theory that a\ndesire p exists if one's attention is directed\ninsistently toward apparent reasons to have it be the case that\np. This is where the evaluative element enters the theory\n(Scanlon 1998).\n\n\nTechnically, Scanlon does not present a complete attention-based\ntheory of desire, but only an attention-based sufficient condition for\nthe existence of a desire. Perhaps this is because Scanlon sees his\ntheory as best suited to characterizing desires that are playing an\nactive role at the moment\u2014occurrent desires\u2014but not as\ngiving a good characterization of desires not having that\nrole\u2014standing desires (see below). A theory of standing desires\nthat follows Scanlon's lead might look something like the\nfollowing.\n\n  For an organism to desire p is for it to be disposed to\n  keep having its attention drawn to reasons to have p, or to\n  reasons to avoid not-p.\n\n  \n\n\nLike good-based theories of desire, Scanlon's\nattention-based theory of desire has not yet been engaged at length by\nproponents of more conservative theories of desire, and it remains to\nbe seen what objections more conservative theorists might raise. One\npuzzle for the theory might come from its focus on one limited form of\nattention. According to the theory, desire's characteristic\neffect is to direct attention toward reasons to fulfill the desire. But\ndesire has notable effects on other forms of attention, too: if Katie\ndesires that Ohio State win a football game, then her desire will\ndirect her attention to information about the game, will direct her\nattention to opportunities to gain information about the game, will\ndirect her attention to people discussing the game, and so on. These\nways in which attention can be directed seem, pre-theoretically, just\nas important to the nature of desire as the ways that are of interest\nto the attention-based theory of desire.\n",
