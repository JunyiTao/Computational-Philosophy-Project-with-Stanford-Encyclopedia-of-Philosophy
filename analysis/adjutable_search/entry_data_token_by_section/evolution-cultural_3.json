    "main_text": "What Evolves? || Reproduction and Selection\n2.3 Reproduction and Selection\n\nWhile there may be a rough consensus among cultural evolutionists on\nthe informational character of culture\u2014perhaps even the social\nnature of transmission\u2014there is less consensus on the nature of\nselection or reproduction in the domain of culture.\n\nHere, skeptical arguments have set the stage. Fracchia and Lewontin\n(1999: 72\u201378), for instance, claim there are no analogs to\nbiological reproduction and natural selection in cultural evolution.\nThey take this to seriously undermine the predictive and explanatory\npower of the analogy. Worse, they say that attempts to fit culture\ninto an evolutionary scheme are procrustean, lopping off the social\npower relations and \u201csociocultural particularity\u201d they\ntake to be at the core of explaining cultural change. Fracchia and\nLewontin argue instead for understanding cultural change as an\ninherently historical process, where explanations appeal to the\nparticular cultural histories of groups (an approach very similar to\nSahlins\u2019s [1985]).\n\nIn response, cultural evolutionary researchers have offered a nested\ntaxonomy of explanatory frameworks that researchers might apply to\nunderstand culture, whose categories reflect increasingly close\napplications of the analogy between biology and culture. The hope is\nto confine concerns like Fracchia and Lewontin\u2019s to the most stringent\nset of approaches, freeing up more liberal interpretations as the\nbasis for empirical work.\n\nClaidi\u00e8re, Scott-Phillips, and Sperber (2014) for instance,\ndistinguish between populational, evolutionary, selectional,\nand replicator frameworks for explaining cultural change.\nRoughly, populational frames provide explanations in terms of the\nfrequency of types that change over time. These could be token ideas,\nartifacts, or behaviors understood as instances of cultural\n\u201ctraits\u201d. Evolutionary approaches are a sub-variety of\npopulational approaches: they assume that distributions of cultural\ntraits in a population can be explained by appeal to properties of\ndistributions at an immediately earlier time. Selectional approaches\nare a sub-variety of evolutionary approach, which appeal to a form of\ncultural natural selection to explain changes in frequencies of\ncultural traits. Finally, replicator approaches are a sub-variety of\nselectional approaches. They assume that cultural evolution acts on\ncultural \u201creplicators\u201d, where cultural replication is\nunderstood in a fairly demanding way. To illustrate the difference\nbetween some of these approaches, consider that a selectional\napproach to the technological evolution of tools, for example,\nrequires comparatively little. There must be variation and inherited\nresemblance over time, with some types of tool increasing their\nfrequency over others in virtue of better fittedness to local demands.\nA replicator approach adds the further requirement that these\ntools, or perhaps the ideas that give rise to them, make copies of\nthemselves in ways that closely parallel genetic replication.\n\nAside from memeticists (discussed in more detail below), few\ncultural evolutionary researchers are committed to the widespread\nexistence of cultural replicators. Instead, contemporary work in\ncultural evolution largely adopts a populational framework. But this\nframework encompasses many possible approaches. Perhaps the prevailing\napproach to \u201cpopulation thinking\u201d, exemplified by many\nclassic studies in the literature (e.g., Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman\n1981; Boyd & Richerson 1985), denotes any effort that employs\nabstracted psychological profiles to explore the consequences of\nindividual-level learning dispositions for the population-level\nproperties of groups. We will see several examples of such thinking\nbelow in the section on \u201cdual-inheritance\u201d. The\nestablishment of population-level consequences are important, for they\nenable investigators to revise the constraints one might naively think\nmust bear on cultural inheritance if specific forms of cultural change\nare to occur.\n\nTo others, the lack\u2014or sheer implausibility\u2014of strict\nselectional or replicator frameworks have spurred exploration of\nmechanisms similar to, but not identical with, the natural\nselection schema. For instance, Strimling, Enquist, and Eriksson\n(2009) develop a model that appeals not just to differential\nrepresentation\u2014that is, of traits in the minds of\nagents\u2014but also to differential persistence in the face\nof new learning. Think of recipes. Home chefs will have learned how to\ncook many recipes over the years. Many will be too fussy, too complex,\nor too bland to warrant making more than once or twice. But some will\nbe winners. These will be recipes cooked time and time again. Though\nthe home chef will have learned how to cook all these recipes, both\nthe overwrought and the tried-and-true, only the latter\nstick, in the sense they are employed again and again. The\naddition of such \u201cstickiness\u201d to a mechanism of selection\nmakes it disanalogous to the natural selection schema, but perhaps not\nin a way that complicates the applicability of a more general\nevolutionary schema nor nearby notions like fitness (Ramsey & De\nBlock 2017).\n\nSimilarly, many have noted the disanalogies between social\ntransmission and biological reproduction. Only the former involves\nagents that recognize, reconstruct, and transmit traits if and when\nthey so choose (Cao 2020). To others, these disanalogies are just a\nproblem of locating the relevant spatiotemporal grain at which\nas-if reproductive relationships can be identified (e.g.,\nAcerbi & Mesoudi 2015).\n\nTo extract a general thread winding through this section, attempts to\n\u201csave the phenomena\u201d appear to limit the explanatory power\nof selective explanations. For if selection and reproduction rely on\nagential dispositions to recognize, reconstruct, retain, and express\ncultural traits\u2014and if these dispositions strongly depend on\ncultural history and context\u2014then selective explanations do not\nseem an advance on already operative social scientific methods (Sober\n1991). Consider that cultural selection should be able to explain the\nstriking fit between cultural traits, the technologies of particular\ngroups, and the local ecologies in which they operate. But the extent\nto which selective explanations are more illuminating than historical\nor agent-centered explanations is far from clear (Chellappoo 2022). We\nreturn to this point below.\n",
