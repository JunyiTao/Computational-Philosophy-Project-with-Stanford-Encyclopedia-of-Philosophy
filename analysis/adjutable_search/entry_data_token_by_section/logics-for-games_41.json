Given a logical system, one can design logical\ngames for it, which can then again be studied using some appropriate\ngame logic. Conversely, given a game, one can introduce a logic for\ndescribing it, and then introduce evaluation games for that logic, and\nso on. Sometimes these cycles reach fixed-points, where, say, the\nevaluation game for a formula describing some game is isomorphic to\nthat game itself. But sometimes, the cycling continues. For\ndiscussion, see Rebuschi (2006) and van Benthem\n(2014).\n\nImperfect information Logic games naturally support\nimperfect information, where players do not have complete access to\nwhat their opponents do. Epistemic variations can have far-reaching\nconsequences for the corresponding logics. A particularly prominent\nframework among this lines is the\n independence friendly logic\n of Hintikka and Sandu (1989), see also\nHintikka and Sandu (1997) and Mann, Sandu, and\nSevenster (2011).\n\nArgumentation games and graph games Another strand of\ngame analysis with a connection to logic is the study of argumentation\nnetworks (Dung 1995; Caminada & Gabbay\n2009), with uses in AI and philosophy (Grossi\n2013; Shi 2018)\n\nComputational logic The material in this section is\nclosely connected to games in computational logic, which serve to\nanalyze expressive power of languages. For relevant results and\nconnections with automata theory, see Gr\u00e4del,\nThomas, and Wilke (2002) and\nvan Benthem (2014).\n\nGaming and mechanism design Game design is a\nwell-known aspect in the area of gaming (Rouse\n2000). Likewise, mechanism design is an established topic in\ngame theory (Nisan & Ronen 2001; Osborne\n& Rubinstein 1994). For connections between between logic,\ngame design and planning, see (L\u00f6we,\nPacuit, & Witzel 2011; L\u00f6we 2008).\n\n",
