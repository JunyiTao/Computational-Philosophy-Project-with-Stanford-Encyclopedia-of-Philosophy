In the psychological sense of the word, atheism is a\npsychological state, specifically the state of being an atheist, where\nan atheist is defined as someone who is not a theist and a theist is\ndefined as someone who believes that God exists (or that there are\ngods). This generates the following definition: atheism is the\npsychological state of lacking the belief that God exists. In\nphilosophy, however, and more specifically in the philosophy of\nreligion, the term \u201catheism\u201d is standardly used to refer to\nthe proposition that God does not exist (or, more broadly, to the\nproposition that there are no gods).  Thus, to be an atheist on\nthis definition, it does not suffice to suspend judgment on whether\nthere is a God, even though that implies a lack of theistic belief.\nInstead, one must deny that God exists. This metaphysical sense of the\nword is preferred over other senses, including the psychological\nsense, not just by theistic philosophers, but by many (though not all)\natheists in philosophy as well. For example, Robin Le Poidevin writes,\n\u201cAn atheist is one who denies the existence of a\npersonal, transcendent creator of the universe, rather than one who\nsimply lives his life without reference to such a being\u201d (1996:\nxvii). J. L. Schellenberg says that \u201cin philosophy, the atheist\nis not just someone who doesn\u2019t accept theism, but more strongly\nsomeone who opposes it.\u201d In other words, it is \u201cthe denial\nof theism, the claim that there is no God\u201d (2019: 5).\n\nThis definition is also found in multiple encyclopedias and\ndictionaries of philosophy. For example, in the Concise Routledge\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy, William L. Rowe (also an atheist)\nwrites, \u201cAtheism is the position that affirms the nonexistence of\nGod. It proposes positive disbelief rather than mere suspension of\nbelief\u201d (2000: 62).  The Cambridge Dictionary of\nPhilosophy recognizes multiple senses of the word\n\u201catheism\u201d, but is clear about which is standard in\nphilosophy:\n\n\n[Atheism is] the view that there are no gods. A widely used sense\ndenotes merely not believing in god and is consistent with agnosticism\n[in the psychological sense]. A stricter sense denotes a belief that\nthere is no god; this use has become standard. (Pojman 2015,\nemphasis added)\n\n\nInterestingly, the Encyclopedia of Philosophy recommends a\nslight broadening of the standard definition of \u201catheist\u201d.\nIt still requires rejection of belief in God as opposed to merely\nlacking that belief, but the basis for the rejection need not be that\ntheism is false. For example, it might instead be that it is\nmeaningless.\n\n\nAccording to the most usual definition, an atheist is a\nperson who maintains that there is no God, that is, that the sentence\n\u201cGod exists\u201d expresses a false proposition. In contrast, an\nagnostic [in the epistemological sense] maintains that it is not known\nor cannot be known whether there is a God, that is, whether the\nsentence \u201cGod exists\u201d expresses a true proposition. On our\ndefinition, an atheist is a person who rejects belief in God,\nregardless of whether or not the reason for the rejection is the claim\nthat \u201cGod exists\u201d expresses a false proposition. People\nfrequently adopt an attitude of rejection toward a position for\nreasons other than that it is a false proposition. It is common among\ncontemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier\ncenturies, to reject positions on the ground that they are\nmeaningless. (Edwards 2006: 358)\n\n\nAt least until recently, the standard metaphysical understanding of\nthe meaning of \u201catheism\u201d was so ingrained in philosophy that\nphilosophers could safely use the word \u201catheism\u201d in that\nsense without worrying that they might be misunderstood and without\nfeeling any need to defend it. For example, in his book, Arguing\nAbout Gods, Graham Oppy (another atheist) repeatedly treats\n\u201cagnostic\u201d (in the psychological sense of someone who\nsuspends judgment about God\u2019s existence) and \u201catheist\u201d\nas mutually exclusive categories (2006, 1, 15, and 34) without\noffering any justification for doing so. The only plausible\nexplanation for his failure to provide justification is that he\nexpects his readers to construe the term \u201catheism\u201d in its\nmetaphysical sense and thus to exclude from the class of atheists\nanyone who suspends judgment about whether gods exist.  Another\nsign of how dominant the standard definition is within the field of\nphilosophy is the frequent use of the term \u201cnon-theist\u201d to\nrefer to the broader class of people who lack the belief that God\nexists.\n\nOf course, from the fact that \u201catheism\u201d is standardly\ndefined in philosophy as the proposition that God does not exist, it\ndoes not follow that it ought to be defined that way. And the\nstandard definition is not without its philosophical opponents. For\nexample, some writers at least implicitly identify atheism with a\npositive metaphysical theory like naturalism or even materialism.\nGiven this sense of the word, the meaning of \u201catheism\u201d is\nnot straightforwardly derived from the meaning of\n\u201ctheism\u201d. While this might seem etymologically bizarre,\nperhaps a case can be made for the claim that something like\n(metaphysical) naturalism was originally labeled \u201catheism\u201d\nonly because of the cultural dominance of non-naturalist forms of\ntheism, not because the view being labeled was nothing more than the\ndenial of theism. On this view, there would have been atheists even if\nno theists ever existed\u2014they just wouldn\u2019t have been\ncalled \u201catheists\u201d. Baggini [2003, 3\u201310] suggests this line\nof thought, although his \u201cofficial\u201d definition is the\nstandard metaphysical one. While this definition of\n\u201catheism\u201d is a legitimate one, it is often accompanied by\nfallacious inferences from the (alleged) falsity or probable falsity\nof atheism (= naturalism) to the truth or probable truth of\ntheism.\n\nDeparting even more radically from the norm in philosophy, a few\nphilosophers (e.g., Michael Martin 1990: 463\u2013464) join many\nnon-philosophers in defining \u201catheist\u201d as someone who\nlacks the belief that God exists.  This commits them to adopting the\npsychological sense of \u201catheism\u201d discussed above,\naccording to which \u201catheism\u201d should not be defined as a\nproposition at all, even if theism is a proposition. Instead,\n\u201catheism\u201d, according to these philosophers, should be\ndefined as a psychological state: the state of not believing in the\nexistence of God (or gods). This view was famously proposed by the\nphilosopher Antony Flew and arguably played a role in his (1972)\ndefense of an alleged presumption of \u201catheism\u201d. The\neditors of the Oxford Handbook of Atheism (Bullivant &\nRuse 2013) also favor this definition and one of them, Stephen\nBullivant (2013), defends it on grounds of scholarly utility. His\nargument is that this definition can best serve as an umbrella term\nfor a wide variety of positions that have been identified with\natheism. Scholars can then use adjectives like \u201cstrong\u201d\nand \u201cweak\u201d (or \u201cpositive\u201d and\n\u201cnegative\u201d) to develop a taxonomy that differentiates\nvarious specific atheisms. Unfortunately, this argument overlooks the\nfact that, if atheism is defined as a psychological state, then no\nproposition can count as a form of atheism because a proposition is\nnot a psychological state. This undermines Bullivant\u2019s argument\nin defense of Flew\u2019s definition; for it implies that what he\ncalls \u201cstrong atheism\u201d\u2014the proposition (or belief in\nthe sense of \u201csomething believed\u201d) that there is no\nGod\u2014is not really a variety of atheism at all. In short, his\nproposed \u201cumbrella\u201d term leaves so-called strong atheism\n(or what some call positive atheism) out in the rain.\n\nAlthough Flew\u2019s definition of \u201catheism\u201d fails as an\numbrella term, it is certainly a legitimate definition in the sense\nthat it reports how a significant number of people use the term.\nAgain, the term \u201catheism\u201d has more than one legitimate\nmeaning, and nothing said in this entry should be interpreted as an\nattempt to proscribe how people label themselves or what meanings they\nattach to those labels. The issue for philosophy and thus for this\nentry is which definition is the most useful for scholarly or, more\nnarrowly, philosophical purposes. In other contexts, of course, the\nissue of how best to define \u201catheism\u201d or\n\u201catheist\u201d may look very different. For example, in some\ncontexts the crucial question may be which definition of\n\u201catheist\u201d (as opposed to \u201catheism\u201d) is the\nmost useful politically, especially in light of the bigotry that those\nwho identify as atheists face. The fact that there is strength in\nnumbers may recommend a very inclusive definition of\n\u201catheist\u201d that brings anyone who is not a theist into the\nfold. Having said that, one would think that it would further no good\ncause, political or otherwise, to attack fellow non-theists who do not\nidentify as atheists simply because they choose to use the term\n\u201catheist\u201d in some other, equally legitimate sense.\n\nThe next question, then, is why the standard metaphysical definition\nof \u201catheism\u201d is especially useful for doing philosophy. One\nobvious reason is that it has the virtue of making atheism a direct\nanswer to one of the most important metaphysical questions in\nphilosophy of religion, namely, \u201cDoes God exist?\u201d There are\nonly two possible direct answers to this question: \u201cyes\u201d,\nwhich is theism, and \u201cno\u201d, which is atheism in the\nmetaphysical sense. Answers like \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d,\n\u201cno one knows\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d, \u201can\naffirmative answer has never been established\u201d, and \u201cthe\nquestion is meaningless\u201d are not direct answers to this question\n(cf. Le Poidevin 2010: 8). It is useful for philosophers to have a\ngood name for this important metaphysical position, and\n\u201catheism\u201d works beautifully for that purpose. Of course, it\nmay also be useful on occasion to have a term to refer to all people\nwho lack theistic belief, but as noted above philosophers already have\nsuch a term, namely, \u201cnontheist\u201d, so the term\n\u201catheist\u201d is not needed for that purpose.\n\nA second reason for preferring the metaphysical definition is that the\ntwo main alternatives to it have undesirable implications. Defining\n\u201catheism\u201d as naturalism has the awkward implication that\nsome philosophers are both theists and atheists. This is because some\nphilosophers (e.g., Ellis 2014) deny that God is supernatural and\naffirm both naturalism and theism. Defining \u201catheism\u201d as the\nstate of lacking belief in God faces similar problems.  First,\nwhile this definition seems short and simple, which is virtuous, it\nneeds to be expanded to avoid the issue of babies, cats, and rocks\ncounting as atheists by virtue of lacking belief in God.  While\nthis problem is relatively easy to solve, another is more challenging.\nThis additional problem arises because one can lack belief in God\nwhile at the same time having other pro-attitudes towards theism. For\nexample, some people who lack the belief that God exists may\nnevertheless feel some inclination to believe that God exists. They\nmay even believe that the truth of theism is more probable than its\nfalsity. While such people should not be labeled theists, it is\ncounterintuitive in the extreme to call them atheists. The\npsychological definition also makes atheists out of some people who\nare devoted members (at least in terms of practice) of theistic\nreligious communities.  This is because, as is well-known, some\ndevoted members of such communities have only a vague middling level\nof confidence that God exists and no belief that God exists or even\nthat God probably exists.  It would seem misguided for\nphilosophers to classify such people as atheists.\n\nA third reason to prefer the standard definition in philosophy is that\nit makes the definitions of \u201catheism\u201d and \u201ctheism\u201d\nsymmetrical. One problem with defining \u201catheism\u201d as a\npsychological state is that philosophers do not define\n\u201ctheism\u201d as a psychological state, nor should they.\n\u201cTheism,\u201d like most other philosophical \u201c-isms\u201d,\nis understood in philosophy to be a proposition. This is crucial\nbecause philosophers want to say that theism is true or false and,\nmost importantly, to construct or evaluate arguments for theism.\nPsychological states cannot be true or false, nor can they be the\nconclusions of arguments. Granted, philosophers sometimes define\n\u201ctheism\u201d as \u201cthe belief that God exists\u201d\nand it makes sense to argue for a belief and to say that a belief is\ntrue or false, but here \u201cbelief\u201d means \u201csomething\nbelieved\u201d. It refers to the propositional content of belief, not\nto the attitude or psychological state of believing. If, however,\n\u201ctheism\u201d is defined as the proposition that God exists and\n\u201ctheist\u201d as someone who believes that proposition, then it\nmakes sense to define \u201catheism\u201d and \u201catheist\u201d in\nan analogous way. This means, first, defining \u201catheism\u201d as a\nproposition or position so that it can be true or false and can be the\nconclusion of an argument and, second, defining \u201catheist\u201d as\nsomeone who believes that proposition. Since it is also natural to\ndefine \u201catheism\u201d in terms of theism, it follows that, in the\nabsence of good reasons to do otherwise, it is best for philosophers\nto understand the \u201ca-\u201d in \u201catheism\u201d as negation\ninstead of absence, as \u201cnot\u201d instead of\n\u201cwithout\u201d\u2014in other words, to take atheism to be the\ncontradictory of theism.\n\nTherefore, for all three of these reasons, philosophers ought to\nconstrue atheism as the proposition that God does not exist (or, more\nbroadly, as the proposition that there are no divine realities of any\nsort).\n\nIf, as has been argued here, atheism is both usually and\nbest understood in philosophy as the metaphysical claim that\nGod does not exist, then what, one might wonder, should philosophers\ndo with the popular term, \u201cNew Atheism\u201d? Philosophers\nwrite articles on and have devoted journal issues (French &\nWettstein 2013) to the New Atheism, but there is nothing close to a\nconsensus on how that term should be defined. Fortunately, there is no\nreal need for one, because the term \u201cNew Atheism\u201d does not\npick out some distinctive philosophical position or phenomenon.\nInstead, it is a popular label for a movement prominently represented\nby four authors\u2014Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and\nChristopher Hitchens\u2014whose work is uniformly critical of\nreligion, but beyond that appears to be unified only by timing and\npopularity. Further, one might question what is new about the New\nAtheism. The specific criticisms of religion and of arguments used to\ndefend religion are not new. For example, an arguably more\nsophisticated and convincing version of Dawkins\u2019 central\natheistic argument can be found in Hume\u2019s Dialogues\n(Wielenberg 2009). Also, while Dennett (2006) makes a passionate call\nfor the scientific study of religion as a natural phenomenon, such\nstudy existed long before this call. Indeed, even the cognitive\nscience of religion was well established by the 1990s, and the\nanthropology of religion can be traced back at least to the nineteenth\ncentury. Shifting from content to style, many are surprised by the\nmilitancy of some New Atheists, but there were plenty of aggressive\natheists who were quite disrespectful to religion long before Harris,\nDawkins, and Hitchens. (Dennett is not especially militant.) Finally,\nthe stereotype that New Atheism is religious or quasi-religious or\nideological in some unprecedented way is clearly a false one and one\nthat New Atheists reject. (For elaboration of these points, see Zenk\n2013.)\n\nAnother subcategory of atheism is \u201cfriendly atheism\u201d,\nwhich William Rowe (1979) defines as the position that, although God\ndoes not exist, some (intellectually sophisticated) people are\njustified in believing that God exists. Rowe, a friendly atheist\nhimself, contrasts friendly atheism with unfriendly atheism and\nindifferent atheism. Unfriendly atheism is the view that atheism is\ntrue and that no (sophisticated) theistic belief is justified. Despite\nits highly misleading name, this view might be held by the\nfriendliest, most open-minded and religiously tolerant person\nimaginable. Finally, although Rowe refers to \u201cindifferent\natheism\u201d as a \u201cposition\u201d, it is not a proposition\nbut instead a psychological state, specifically, the state of being an\natheist who is neither friendly nor unfriendly\u2014that is, who\nneither believes that friendly atheism is true nor believes that\nunfriendly atheism is true.\n\nPerhaps an even more interesting distinction is between pro-God\natheism and anti-God atheism. A pro-God atheist like John Schellenberg\n(who coined the term in unpublished work) is someone who in some real\nsense loves God or at least the idea of God, who tries very hard to\nimagine what sorts of wonderful worlds such a being might create\n(instead of just assuming that such a being would create a world\nsomething like the world we observe), and who (at least\npartly) for that very reason believes that God does not exist. Such an\natheist might be sympathetic to the following sentiments:\n\n\nIt is an insult to God to believe in God. For on the one hand it is to\nsuppose that he has perpetrated acts of incalculable cruelty. On the\nother hand, it is to suppose that he has perversely given his human\ncreatures an instrument\u2014their intellect\u2014which must\ninevitably lead them, if they are dispassionate and honest, to deny\nhis existence. It is tempting to conclude that if he exists, it is the\natheists and agnostics that he loves best, among those with any\npretensions to education. For they are the ones who have taken him\nmost seriously. (Strawson 1990)\n\n\nBy contrast, anti-God atheists like Thomas Nagel (1997: 130\u2013131)\nfind the whole idea of a God offensive and hence not only believe but\nalso hope very much that no such being exists. Nagel is often\ncalled an \u201cantitheist\u201d (e.g., Kahane 2011), but that term\nis purposely avoided here, as it has many different senses (Kahane\n2011: note 9). Also, in none of those senses is one required to be an\natheist in order to be an antitheist, so antitheism is not a variety\nof atheism.\n",
