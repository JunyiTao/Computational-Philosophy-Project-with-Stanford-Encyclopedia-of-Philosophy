    "main_text": "Leopold L\u00f6wenheim\n7. Leopold L\u00f6wenheim\n\nIn 1915, L\u00f6wenheim published his landmark \u201c\u00dcber\nM\u00f6glichkeiten im Relativkalk\u00fcl\u201d. This paper, written\nin the tradition of the Peirce-Schroeder calculus of relatives,\nestablished the first significant metalogical theorem; from certain\npoints of view, it marks the beginning of model theory. L\u00f6wenheim\nconsidered a class of what he called \u201ccounting\nexpressions\u201d (Z\u00e4hlausdr\u00fccke) whose\nquantifiers range only over the domain of objects in the universe, but\nnot over relatives; he then proved that, for any such counting\nexpression, if it is satisfiable, it is satisfiable in some\ndenumerable domain. In modern terminology, his \u201ccounting\nexpressions\u201d are formulas of first-order logic; but his\nterminology shows no influence either from Peirce\u2019s logic of\n\u201cfirst intention\u201d, or from Russell\u2019s theory of\ntypes. L\u00f6wenheim, like all logicians of this era, did not possess\nthe distinction between an object language and a metalanguage. His\nproof is difficult to follow, and the precise details of his\ntheorem\u2014of what he believed he had proved, and what he had, in\nfact, proved\u2014have been the subject of extensive scholarly\ndiscussion. (A survey of the differing interpretations is provided by\nMancosu, Zach, & Badesa 2009, and a detailed reconstruction of the proof itself by\nBadesa 2004.) The paper appears to have had no influence until Skolem\nsharpened and extended its results in his 1920. L\u00f6wenheim, like\nPeirce and Russell, did not isolate an axiomatic system encompassing\nfirst-order logic, nor did he draw a distinction between syntax and\nsemantics. Still less does he argue that his class of \u201ccounting\nexpressions\u201d is in some way logically privileged, and provides a\nfavored foundation for mathematics. The L\u00f6wenheim theorem was in\ntime to be recognized as isolating a fundamental property of\nfirst-order logic. But the full implications of his result were not to\nbecome clear until later, after Hilbert had introduced the\nmetamathematical study of logical systems. (Incidentally,\nL\u00f6wenheim credited the elegant \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(\\Pi\\) symbolism\nof Peirce for suggesting the infinitary expansions that were necessary\nto his proof; and it is difficult to see how he could have obtained\nhis theorem with any of the other quantificational notations then on\noffer. He was still vigorously defending the advantages of the\nPeirce-Schroeder notation against the notation of Principia\nas late as L\u00f6wenheim 1940.)\n",
