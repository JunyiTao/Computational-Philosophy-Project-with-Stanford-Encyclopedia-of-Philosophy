    "main_text": "The Problem of Interaction || The Pairing Problem\n2.2 The Pairing Problem\n\nA second version of the Problem of Interaction is the \u201cPairing\nProblem\u201d (Kim 1973, 2005; Sosa 1984; Foster 1991, ch. 6).\nImagine two exactly similar minds M1 and\nM2 and the bodies B1 and\nB2 to which they are \u201cattached\u201d, that\nis, the bodies with which they directly interact. In virtue of what is\nM1 causally paired with B1,\nand M2 with B2?\n\nThis is not the epistemological question of how we could know that\nthese are the pairings (although this is troublesome, too). The\nquestion, rather, is metaphysical: in virtue of what are these the\npairings? If minds were, like bodies, located in space, causal pairing\ncould be achieved by the relative spatial locations of the substances\n(Bailey et al. 2011). Particular minds might be inside or\n\u201cinhabit\u201d particular bodies. But if minds are non-spatial\nsouls, relative spatial location is unavailable to fill the pairing\nrole. And since M1 and M2 are,\nby hypothesis, exactly similar, we cannot appeal to the different\nintrinsic properties that they might possess.\n\nIn reply, a dualist could appeal to \u201cindividualistic\u201d\npowers (Unger 2006, pp. 242\u201359; Foster 1991, pp. 167\u20138).\nPowers are standardly thought of as powers to interact with some\ntype of object. A key has the power to open this lock, but\nonly by virtue of having the power to open any lock of this kind, the\npower to open any intrinsically comparable lock. Individualistic\npowers, in contrast, are powers possessed by an object to affect or be\naffected by a particular object. Think of a key with the\npower to open this lock, but without the power to open any\nintrinsically indiscernible lock. Likewise, a soul could have the\npower to interact with a particular body and no other. As the key\nexample suggests, however, it is by no means obvious that powers could\nbe individualistic in this sense (but see Audi 2011).\n",
