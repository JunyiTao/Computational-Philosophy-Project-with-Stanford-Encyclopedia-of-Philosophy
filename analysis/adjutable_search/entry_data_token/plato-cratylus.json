But its specific\ntopic\u2014the \u201ccorrectness of names\u201d (orthot\u00eas\nt\u00f4n onomat\u00f4n)\u2014seems to have so little to do\nwith the concerns of modern philosophers of language that it needs\nsome introduction. The first thing to note is that the Greek term\nonomata (onoma in the singular), standardly\ntranslated as \u201cnames\u201d, denotes not only proper names and\ncommon nouns, but also adjectives and even verbs in infinitive and\nparticiple mood. When investigating the \u201ccorrectness of\nnames\u201d, the Cratylus attempts to ascertain why it is\ncorrect to use certain members of this motley class of linguistic\nitems to refer to certain elements of reality. Most of us would not\nhesitate to assert that correctness in this sense is a matter of\ndecision or convention. Saying that it is correct to\nuse the common noun \u201chorse\u201d to refer to horses can only\nmean, it seems, that \u201chorse\u201d is conventionally used in\nthis way. This appealing position, widely known as\nconventionalism, is not absent from the Cratylus: It\nis championed by Hermogenes, the dialogue\u2019s first protagonist.\nBut Cratylus, the dialogue\u2019s second protagonist, begs to differ.\nHe stubbornly espouses a rather cryptic naturalism, claiming\nthat a correct name for any given element of reality needs to fulfil\nan elusive natural standard. Socrates, the dialogue\u2019s third\nprotagonist, adjudicates on the contested issue.\n\nThe Cratylus is (in)famous for its surprising twists and\nturns, and it is often considered one of Plato\u2019s most vexing\nworks. It has also proven difficult to determine its place within\nPlato\u2019s oeuvre. As it introduces Platonic forms in a way that is\nreminiscent of the Phaedo, many commentators assume that it\nmust have been written in the same period as this dialogue (see, e.g.,\nRoss 1955; Luce 1964; Levin 2001: 4 n. 4). But it also provides a\nsomewhat preliminary treatment of issues that are discussed more fully\nin later dialogues like the Theaetetus and the\nSophist, and so a variety of alternative datings have been\ndiscussed (see, e.g., Kirk 1951; Mackenzie 1986; Sedley 2003:\n6\u201316). There is, however, another (and arguably more important)\nsense in which the Cratylus is hard to pin down: It is not\nclear how its main topic\u2014the correctness of names\u2014is\nconnected with Plato\u2019s other philosophical concerns. This is\nprobably the reason why this fascinating dialogue is often treated in\na cursory way in general discussions of Plato\u2019s philosophy.\n", "toc": [{"#CratPersFirsOver": "1.

The Cratylus and Its Personae\u2014a First Overview\n\nWho are the protagonists of the Cratylus? All of them are\nhistorical figures\u2014citizens of fifth and fourth century Athens,\nto be precise. Hermogenes was a (possibly illegitimate) offspring of a\nvery wealthy and powerful Athenian dynasty (on which see Nails 2002:\n68\u201374), but did apparently not inherit anything from his family\n(391c). Always in financial troubles (384c), he was a committed member\nof the circle around Socrates; as the Phaedo (59b) indicates,\nhe was even present at Socrates\u2019 death. Cratylus was a\nphilosopher who, according to Aristotle\u2019s report, taught the\nyoung Plato (Metaphysics 987a29\u2013b7). He is known as a\nradical advocate of the Heraclitean claim that everything is in flux;\napparently, he even stopped speaking at some point because he took\nspeaking to be senseless in a world of flux (Metaphysics\n1010a7\u201315). In the Cratylus, he appears to be at an\nearly stage of his philosophical career, just beginning to appropriate\nHeraclitean positions (440d\u2013e; cf. Kirk 1951: 236). About\nSocrates, the third protagonist, there is so much to say that\ninterested readers should consult the entry on\n Socrates.\n One well-known fact appears to be particularly relevant in the\npresent context, however: Socrates was the other teacher of the young\nPlato\u2014which means that the Cratylus is an encounter\nbetween the two philosophers who influenced Plato most directly.\n\nThe Cratylus begins when Socrates joins the on-going debate\nbetween Cratylus and Hermogenes as an arbiter. He first invites\nHermogenes to state his conventionalist view of the correctness of\nnames (383a\u2013386e)\u2014and refutes him by presenting an\nargument for the conclusion that names are indeed subject to a\nstandard of natural correctness (386e\u2013390e). Asked to expand on\nthis standard (391a), Socrates conjectures that a correct name needs\nto be a portmanteau: Like the name \u201cshepherd\u201d (from\n\u201csheep\u201d and \u201cherder\u201d), it needs to be composed\nof other names in a way that ensures that it encapsulates a\ndescription of what its referents are (390e\u2013394e). He\nillustrates this conjecture by uncovering the descriptive content of\nmany Greek names in a famous\u2014and famously\nextensive\u2014etymological survey (394e\u2013421c). The survey ends\nabruptly when Socrates realizes that he cannot account for the\ncorrectness of all names in this way; there must, after all, be some\nnames that are not composed of other names. Socrates\u2019 hypothesis\nis that these names are correct because they are imitations of what\ntheir referents are (421c\u2013427d). He thus arrives at a two-tiered\nnaturalist theory of the correctness of names. Cratylus, who takes\nover from Hermogenes as Socrates\u2019 interlocutor, endorses this\ntheory enthusiastically. But in a surprising twist, Socrates turns\nagainst his own brainchild and compels Cratylus to admit that\nconvention is a factor that contributes to the correctness of names\n(427d\u2013435d). He never spells out, however, what exactly the\ncontribution of convention is. He rather goes on to refute\nCratylus\u2019 further claim that unearthing the descriptive content\nof names yields unshakable evidence for the belief that reality is in\na state of flux (435d\u2013439c)\u2014and ends his investigation by\nsketching four arguments for the existence of unchangeable forms\n(439c\u2013440e).\n2. Exegetical Divides\n\nAs should be clear from the above summary, the Cratylus is a\nlong and intricate work, and it raises many pressing questions. But\nthere seems to be one question that must play a role in any attempt to\narrive at an overall interpretation of this dialogue:\n\n\nWhich view of the correctness of names does the Cratylus\nsupport?\n\n\nGiven the obvious importance of this question, it is reasonable to\nprovide a quick overview of the possible answers before taking a\ncloser look at the Cratylus. There are three such answers,\ncorresponding to three possible readings of the Cratylus:\n\nReading A: Some commentators\nbelieve that the Cratylus supports Hermogenes\u2019\nconventionalism. In their view, Plato\u2019s readers are not supposed\nto accept Socrates\u2019 refutation of conventionalism and the\nnaturalist theory he elaborates at 390e\u2013427d. Instead, they are\nto infer from Socrates\u2019 criticism of this naturalist theory at\n430a\u2013435b that Hermogenes was right all along with his denial of\na natural correctness of names. (See Lanzalaco 1955; Guzzo 1956;\nRobinson 1956; Bestor 1980; Rehn 1982; Schofield 1982; and Ademollo\n2009 and 2011.)\nReading B: Other commentators take\nthe arguments of 430a\u2013435b to establish a very different result:\nConventions may ensure that (some) names fulfil a certain minimal\nstandard of correctness; but nevertheless, the extent to which names\nare correct depends on how well they describe or imitate what their\nreferents are. It is thus the naturalist theory of the correctness of\nnames elaborated at 390e\u2013427d that is borne out by the\nCratylus, albeit in a refined version which ascribes a\ncertain limited role to convention. (See Grote 1865: ch. XXIX; Benfey\n1866: Weingartner 1970; Anagnostopoulos 1973; Fine 1977; Palmer 1989;\nBarney 2001; and Sedley 2003.)\nReading C: Yet other commentators\nurge a sharp distinction between the claim that there is a natural\ncorrectness of names and the claim that correct names need to describe\nor imitate what their referents are. They argue that the\nCratylus supports the former and undermines the latter claim.\n(See Kretzmann 1971; Kahn 1973; Gold 1978; Ketchum 1979; Heitsch 1984;\nand Mei\u00dfner forthcoming a.)\n\n\nIt would be an exaggeration to say that these are the only available\ninterpretations of the Cratylus. There are, for example,\nauthors who claim that Plato\u2019s main goal in the\nCratylus is to debunk the idea that etymological analyses can\nlead to philosophical knowledge (Baxter 1992 and Keller 2000), or that\nhe wishes to make an ontological point about flux and stability\n(Gaiser 1974). But the most important dividing lines among\ninterpreters of the Cratylus have certainly been exhibited by\ndistinguishing between\n Reading A,\n Reading B, and\n Reading C;\n and it will become evident in due course that many scholarly disputes\nabout individual passages and arguments can be traced back to the\ndifferences between these readings.\n3. Hermogenes\u2019 Conventionalism (383a\u2013386e)\n\nWhen Socrates agrees to join the debate between Hermogenes and\nCratylus, Hermogenes immediately bursts out with his own view of the\ncorrectness of names (384c\u2013e). Frustrated by the on-going\nquarrel with a recalcitrant Cratylus, he is probably hoping for some\nsort of support, or at least for clarity. However, Socrates reacts by\nasking questions and presenting arguments that do not make any\nimmediately recognizable contribution to the clarification of the\nissue at hand (384e\u2013386e). The present section will ascertain\nwhat Hermogenes wishes to claim and discuss the perplexing way in\nwhich Socrates responds to Hermogenes\u2019 contentions.\n3.1 What Hermogenes Does (Not) Say\n\nHermogenes\u2019 main claim is\u2014as has already been\nindicated\u2014that it is completely dependent on conventions and\ndecisions whether any given name is a correct name for any object or\nkind of object. Today, a convention ensures that \u201cBoris\nJohnson\u201d is a correct name for a former prime minister of the\nUnited Kingdom; but if Hermogenes is right, this convention might be\nchanged tomorrow, and the very same name might then be a correct name\nfor the cat that currently lives in 10 Downing Street. One can thus\nnever go wrong in imposing a name on a given (kind of)\nobject\u2014such an act will automatically turn the name into a\ncorrect name for this (kind of) object.\n\nAs it stands, this claim seems plausible. Note, however, that it needs\nto be distinguished very carefully from the infinitely less plausible\nclaim that one cannot go wrong in using a name that has already been\nimposed on some (kind of) object. Scholars used to agree that\nHermogenes fails to make this vital distinction: that he does not keep\napart name imposition and name use and thus ends up denying the\npossibility of misapplying a name and, ultimately, the possibility of\nfalse speaking (see, e.g., Gold 1978: 242f.; Williams 1982: 90; and\nMackenzie 1986: 126). But as more recent work (especially Barney 1997)\nhas demonstrated, this diagnosis is not borne out by the evidence. For\nHermogenes consistently uses the term tithenai to refer to\nacts of name imposition and the term kalein to refer to acts\nof name use. Given this terminological circumspection, it would be\nuncharitable to charge him with a crude conceptual confusion.\n(However, see Healow 2020 for a defense of the claim that Hermogenes\nis less clear about the distinction between name imposition and name\nuse at 384c\u2013e than at 385d\u2013e.)\n\nBut who exactly has the authority to impose names on\nthings\u2014linguistic communities or even individual speakers?\nPressed on this point, Hermogenes opts for the latter option\n(385a\u2013b). If you decide to impose the name \u201cBoris\nJohnson\u201d on the cat that lives in 10 Downing Street while all\nother speakers continue to use this name for the former prime\nminister, \u201cBoris Johnson\u201d will be a private correct name\nfor the cat and a public correct name for its former human\nhousemate\u2014or so Hermogenes says. This concession does not imply,\nas scholars used to think, that a speaker with solipsistic\ninclinations can apply names in a way that is in principle immune to\ncriticism and correction (see, e.g., Robinson 1956: 338; Kahn 1973:\n158f.; and Baxter 1992: 18). For Hermogenes never considers naming\nconventions that are private in the sense that no other speakers could\npossibly become party to them; he talks about naming conventions that\nare accidentally private, not about naming conventions that\nare essentially private. And it is hard to see how a\nspeaker\u2019s adherence to naming conventions that are only\naccidentally private would allow her to apply names in a way that is\nin principle immune to criticism and correction (Barney 1997:\n152\u2013156).\n\nWhile older discussions of the passage 383a\u2013386e thus tended to\npaint Hermogenes as a confused or radical \u201canything goes\u201d\nconventionalist, there are good and widely accepted reasons for\nreversing this traditional verdict. All Hermogenes wishes to claim is,\napparently, that speakers are at least in principle completely free to\nimpose any name they like on any given (kind of) object. And\nthis view seems to be very much in tune with common\nsense.\n3.2 True and False Names\n\nAccording to all extant manuscripts of the Cratylus, Socrates\nreacts to Hermogenes\u2019 concession that private naming conventions\nare possible by presenting an argument for the conclusion that\n\u201cit is possible to say a true and a false name\u201d\n (385b\u2013d).[1]\n But as this conclusion is so strange, and as there is also a\nphilological problem with the transition from 385d1 to 385d2\u20133\n(Schofield 1972: 248), it is contested whether Socrates\u2019\nargument really belongs where the manuscripts have it. While many\ncommentators claim that it should either be transposed between 387c5\nand c6 (Schofield 1972: 246\u2013251 and Barney 2001: 28) or excised\nfrom the text altogether (Sedley 2003: 10\u201313), some are strictly\nopposed to such radical measures (Baxter 1992: 32\u201317 and\nAdemollo 2011: 68\u201370).\n\nAs it is not possible to summarize the immensely complicated debate\nabout the textual status of the contested passage in the confines of\nthis entry, the best course is to switch to the conditional mood and\nprovide a brief discussion of the questions that would be most\npressing if Socrates\u2019 argument did belong where the manuscripts\nhave it:\n\nWhat is the purport of the conclusion that \u201cit is\npossible to say a true and a false name\u201d?\nWhy does Socrates establish this conclusion here?\n\n\nRegarding\n (i),\n it is tempting to assume that Socrates\u2019 conclusion rests on the\nfalse idea that names have the same properties\u2014truth and\nfalsehood, in particular\u2014as the sentences of which they are\nparts (Robinson 1956: 328). But a more charitable reading is\navailable: Socrates might not be saying that names can be true and\nfalse in the same absolute sense as sentences, but that they can be\ntrue or false of objects (Fine 1977: 295f.; cf. Lorenz &\nMittelstra\u00df 1967 and Luce 1969). If that were the case, he would\nbe making a respectable and important point about the logical\nproperties of names, comparable to a point made by Quine (Quine 1959:\n65).\n\nRegarding\n (ii),\n one might wonder whether Socrates\u2019 argument is supposed to\nundermine Hermogenes\u2019 position (see, e.g., Kretzmann 1971: 127;\nGaiser 1974: 20; and Bagwell 2011: 20). But as Hermogenes does not\nmake any claims that would compel him to deny that \u201cit is\npossible to say a true and a false name\u201d, this is not a\nplausible conjecture. So maybe Socrates is pursuing a more\nconstructive purpose here. He might be interested, for example, in\nascertaining Hermogenes\u2019 attitude towards the distinction\nbetween truth and falsehood\u2014not least because Hermogenes\u2019\nclaim that one cannot go wrong in imposing names might wrongly be\ntaken to imply that false speaking is impossible (Richardson 1976:\n136f.; Ademollo 2011: 65\u201368).\n3.3 Conventionalism and Relativism\n\nOnce Socrates\u2019 has drawn the conclusion that \u201cit is\npossible to say a true and a false name\u201d, Hermogenes reaffirms\nhis conventionalist position loudly and clearly (385d\u2013e).\nSocrates proceeds to inquire whether Hermogenes accepts\nProtagoras\u2019 claim that \u201chowever the objects appear to me\nto be, such they are for me\u201d (385e\u2013386a). This is a\nradical claim, entailing that objects have their properties in a\nsubject-dependent manner: that it only makes sense to ask whether it\nis the case for some subject S that an object\nO has property P, but not whether it is objectively\nthe case that O has P. Hermogenes admits that he\nfound this relativist outlook tempting at some point, but is\nnevertheless unwilling to adopt it (386a). Socrates then presents an\nargument against relativism: Since there are both virtuous and wicked\npersons, and since virtuous persons are wise and wicked persons\nunwise, Protagoras cannot be right in saying that no one is ever wrong\nabout anything (386a\u2013e). A very similar argument is found to be\nwanting in the Theaetetus (166d\u2013167d). But here in the\nCratylus, Socrates is happy to conclude from his reflections\nthat \u201cobjects have some stable being of their own\u201d (386e).\nHe thus asserts that objects have their properties in a\nsubject-independent manner: that it makes sense to ask whether a\nsubject S is objectively right or objectively wrong in\nbelieving that an object O has property P.\n\nIt is not clear why Socrates discusses Protagorean relativism with\nHermogenes. Commentators used to think that he does this because\nHermogenes defends an \u201canything goes\u201d conventionalism that\nhas relativist implications (see, e.g., Mackenzie 1986: 129; Palmer\n1988: 44\u201350; and Silverman 1992: 31\u201334); but as has been\nnoted, Hermogenes\u2019 position is in fact a very sensible one. If\nthere really is a connection between Hermogenes\u2019 conventionalism\nand Protagorean relativism, it must thus be of a more indirect nature\n(Barney 1997: 156\u2013162; Mei\u00dfner 2021). It has also been\nargued, however, that Plato has Socrates discuss relativism with\nHermogenes to prevent misunderstandings and show that conventionalism\nabout names has nothing to do with relativism (Ademollo 2011:\n80f.).\n4. The Tool Analogy (386e\u2013390e)\n\nSocrates\u2019 initial reaction to Hermogenes\u2019 conventionalist\nposition is puzzling. But his philosophical agenda becomes more\ntransparent when, at 386e\u2013390e, he uses the result that\nProtagorean relativism is false to show against Hermogenes that there\nis a natural correctness of names. The argument he presents for this\nhighly significant interim conclusion is analogical in nature: It\ncompares names to tools such as knives or drills to establish that\nthey are subject to a natural standard and need to be introduced by an\nexpert. This section takes a closer look at this major turning point\nof Socrates\u2019 investigation.\n4.1 The Name as a Tool for Naming\n\nTo set up the analogy between names and tools, Socrates considers\nactions. Given that objects have a stable being or a stable nature of\ntheir own, actions too must have a stable nature (386e). This seems to\nmean that a particular act needs to meet a certain objective standard\nto count as a genuine instance of a given action\n type.[2]\n As Socrates points out, one will meet this standard if and only if\none handles a naturally suitable tool in a naturally fitting way\n(387a\u2013b). This entails, crucially, that a tool for a given\naction needs to fulfil an objective or natural standard: It needs to\nbe such as to enable a competent person to perform this action.\n\nWhat do these plausible reflections about tools have to do with\nnames? To make the connection, Socrates argues that naming\nqua part of speaking is an action with a stable nature\n(387b\u2013d). He combines this claim with his observation that\nactions with a stable nature need to be performed by means of a\nnaturally suitable tool\u2014and infers that naming needs to be\nperformed by means of such a tool. This tool\nis\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014the name (387d\u2013388a). It follows\nthat names are subject to a natural standard in the same (or at least\na similar) sense as drills or shuttles.\n\nAs it stands, this analogical argument is frustratingly abstract. Its\npurport becomes clearer when Socrates provides two closely related\naccounts of naming a little later. He says, first, that \u201cwe\nteach something to each other and separate the objects as they\nstand\u201d (388b) when we name; and he says, second, that we use\nnames for \u201cteaching and for separating being\u201d\n(388b\u2013c). What is the purport of these two accounts of naming?\nConsider the first one first. It is widely and plausibly assumed that\nSocrates explicates the sense in which \u201cwe teach something to\neach other\u201d in naming when he says that we \u201cseparate the\nobjects as they stand\u201d, and so it is best to focus on this\nphrase. Many authors read it as a description of the act of using a\nname to mark off a species or a kind. Some believe that this act\noccurs only in the context of Platonic division and must be\ndistinguished from more mundane forms of naming (see, e.g., Sedley\n2003: 60f. and Ademollo 2011: 112f.); others point out that even in\nthe bread-and-butter sentences \u201cI love dogs\u201d or \u201cHer\nfavorite pastime is reading\u201d, the names \u201cdog\u201d and\n\u201creading\u201d seem to pick out a kind of animal and a kind of\nactivity (Mei\u00dfner 2019: 127\u2013132). Be that as it\nmay\u2014it seems reasonable to assume that Socrates defines naming\nas the act of picking out objects (in the broadest sense of the term)\nas a kind or a species. This construal of Socrates\u2019\nfirst account of naming makes his second account transparent as well.\nReaders of the Platonic dialogues are, after all, well acquainted with\nthe idea that if a name is used to designate a class of objects that\nhave something in common, it can also be said to refer to what its\nreferents have in common\u2014the way of being or the ousia\nthey share (see, e.g., Laches 190e\u2013192a or\nMeno 71e\u201372c). It thus makes sense to move from the\nclaim that we \u201cseparate the objects as they stand\u201d to the\ncontention that we use names \u201cfor separating being\u201d or a\nway of being.\n\nWhen Socrates ascribes a stable nature to naming, he is thus relying\non the assumption that one performs an act of naming if and only if\none picks out a kind or, equivalently, the way of being that is shared\nby the members of this kind. Given this result, the application of his\nreflections on tools like drills or shuttles to names at\n387b\u2013388c is a little easier to follow. His central point is\npresumably that names are subject to a natural standard insofar as\nthey need to be suitable instruments for picking out a kind. The\nsecond stage of his analogical argument will elaborate\nthis\u2014still somewhat vague and elusive\u2014point.\n4.2 Creating (and Evaluating) Names\n\nSocrates proceeds to argue that names are like drills or shuttles not\nonly insofar as they are subject to an objective or natural standard:\nPrecisely because they are subject to such a standard, they are also\nsimilar to ordinary tools insofar as they need to be created by a\nskilled expert. This expert is a lawgiver or nomoth\u00eates\n(388d\u2013389a). A lawgiver, Socrates explains, will create a\nnaturally suitable name only if he looks \u201cto that thing itself\nwhich is a name\u201d (390a). The thought is probably that the\nlawgiver\u2019s creative efforts need to be guided by knowledge of\nhow to produce a linguistic device that enables a competent user to\nperform the action of naming. Socrates adds that the lawgiver needs to\nfulfil a second condition: He needs to embody \u201cthe form of the\nname appropriate to each in syllables of whatever sort\u201d (390a).\nWhat does this mean? In making a parallel claim about shuttle\nproduction, Socrates\u2019 point is that there are different specific\nversions of the action for which shuttles are made\u2014separating\nlinen warp and weft, e.g., or separating woolen warp\nand weft\u2014and that the carpenter needs to create a naturally\nsuitable tool for one of these specific action types (389b\u2013c).\nSocrates must thus be assuming that there are different specific\nversions of naming, and that the lawgiver needs to create a suitable\ntool for one of these versions. Given that naming has been defined as\nthe action of picking out a kind, it is not difficult to see what the\nversions of naming might be: If A and B are\ndifferent kinds, picking out A and picking out B\nwill certainly be different versions of naming. Hence, Socrates\u2019\nclaim is that the lawgiver needs to make sure that his product is a\nsuitable tool for picking out a specific kind.\n\nAll of this sounds rather complicated. But while the details of\nSocrates\u2019 argument are indeed obscure at times, the big picture\nis clearer. Socrates proceeds from the idea that names are tools for\npicking out kinds to the idea that an individual name needs to be\nsuited for picking out a specific kind and must be created\naccordingly. And even though he does not say this in so many words,\nthere can be no doubt that he thus arrives at the following\ncharacterization of correct names:\n\n(NAT)\nA correct name for a given kind is a linguistic device that has\nbeen created from letters and syllables in a way that guarantees that\nit is suited for picking out this kind (or, equivalently, the way of\nbeing shared by its members).\n\n\nAs Socrates hastens to point out (390a\u2013e), an expert\ndialectician is responsible for ascertaining whether a name fulfils\nthe standard described by\n (NAT).\n It is clear, then, that while there are many humdrum contexts in\nwhich names are used, their true purpose is to make possible\ndialectical inquiries.\n4.3 Assessing the Argument of the Tool Analogy\n\nAt 390e, Socrates concludes the tool analogy by stating \u201cthat\nnames belong to the objects by nature\u201d (390d/e). As the above\nanalysis indicates, the purport of this conclusion is captured by\n (NAT).\n But (NAT) is still a highly abstract claim. It is far from clear what\nit takes to create a linguistic device in a way that guarantees that\nit is suited for picking out a given kind (or the being of its\nmembers); and consequently, it is far from clear how a correct name\nfor a given kind differs from a linguistic device that does not\ndeserve that title. This unclarity makes it very hard to say what\nexactly the tool analogy contributes to Socrates\u2019 investigation.\nOne widespread assumption is that the tool analogy\u2019s conclusion\nis a blueprint for the theory of the correctness of names that\nSocrates elaborates at 390e\u2013427d: that (NAT) anticipates the\nclaim that correct names need to be composed of letters and syllables\nin a way that ensures that they describe or imitate the being of their\nreferents. Champions of both\n Reading A\n and\n Reading B\n are committed to this assumption. That does not mean, however, that\nthey agree in their overall assessment of the tool analogy and its\nconclusion\u2014quite the contrary. Champions of Reading\nA contend that while the analogy between names and tools may\nbe highly suggestive, Plato wants his readers to realize that\ncomparing the introduction of a name for a given kind to the creation\nof a tool for a specific task is ultimately misleading\u2014and to\ndiscard the conclusion that there is a natural correctness of names.\nChampions of Reading B disagree strongly: They assume\nthat Plato wants his readers to accept the argument of the tool\nanalogy and its conclusion.\n\nOne way of dealing with the exceedingly abstract conclusion of the\ntool analogy is thus to construe it as an anticipation of the claim\nthat correct names need to be descriptions or imitations, and to ask\nin a next step whether Plato want his readers to accept this claim.\nBut there is also a radically different approach to the problem at\nhand. Champions of\n Reading C\n take the tool analogy\u2019s conclusion to boil down to the claim\nthat names are correct if they have been assigned to genuine kinds by\nadopting suitable conventions (whereas they are not correct if they\nhave been assigned to gerrymandered classes of things such as, e.g.,\nthe class that comprises all cats and all donkeys and nothing else).\nThey argue that Plato wants his readers to accept this\nclaim\u2014and to see that Socrates is going astray when he moves on\nto elaborate the theory that correct names are descriptions or\nimitations of their referents\u2019 being. It has been objected,\nhowever, that assigning a name to a kind and creating a correct name\nin the sense of\n (NAT)\n seem to be two very different things (Ackrill 1994: 18 f.; Smith\n2014). Whether Reading C\u2019s take on the tool\nanalogy is a viable alternative to\n Reading A\u2019s\n and\n Reading B\u2019s\n interpretation is thus a matter of debate (Mei\u00dfner forthcoming\na).\n5. Correctness and Etymological Meaning (390e\u2013394e)\n\nWhen Socrates infers from the argument of the tool analogy \u201cthat\nnames belong to the objects by nature\u201d (390d/e), Hermogenes is\nnot fully convinced and demands to know what \u201cthe natural\ncorrectness of a name consists in\u201d (390e). As has become evident\nby now, this is a good question\u2014it is in fact not clear what\nHermogenes would commit himself to if he accepted\n (NAT).\n Socrates attempts to answer Hermogenes\u2019 question at\n390e\u2013394e by discussing the name \u201cAstyanax\u201d.\n\u201cAstyanax\u201d is actually a proper name of a victim of the\nTrojan war (Hector\u2019s son, who would have become king of Troy had\nthe city not been destroyed). However, Socrates does not treat it as a\nproper name, but as a general term that refers to the kind\n(genos) of kings. He gives the following account of its\ncorrectness:\n\n\n\u201cAstyanax\u201d is a correct name for the kind (genos)\nof kings because its etymological meaning (\u201ctownlord\u201d)\nensures that it indicates (d\u00ealoun) the way of being\n(ousia) that the members of this kind share.\n\n\nWhat does this account entail? What, in particular, does it mean to\nsay that \u201cAstyanax\u201d indicates the way of being\nthat is shared by all kings? It has been claimed that indicating a way\nof being is tantamount to disclosing its definition (see, e.g., Barney\n2001: 103). But Socrates\u2019 examples, and his later use of the\nterm d\u00ealoun (see\n section 8.2),\n suggest that this is an overinterpretation (Ademollo 2011: 165f.).\nApparently, a way of being is indicated if and only if it is\ndistinguished from other ways of being\u2014if it is picked out, as\nit were.\n\nHow, then, does the etymological meaning of the name\n\u201cAstyanax\u201d ensure that it picks out the way of being that\nis characteristic of kings? Socrates\u2019 idea seems to be that the\netymological meaning of the name ensures that it functions as a\ndescription of what it means to be a king. It is important to\nnote, however, that indicating something does not necessarily entail\ndescribing it; as Socrates will explain at 421c\u2013427e, names that\nare not composed of other names indicate a way of being in virtue of\nimitating it. But in the passage at hand, he ignores this possibility\nand focuses on names that are composed of other\nnames\u2014etymologically complex names, as one might\nsay.\n\nSocrates does not stop to distill a general account of the correctness\nof etymologically complex names from his reflections on the name\n\u201cAstyanax\u201d. But he clearly has the following account in\nmind:\n\n(NAT*)\nIf an etymologically complex name is a correct name for a given\nkind, this is because its etymological meaning ensures that it\ndescribes and thus indicates the way of being (ousia) that\nthe members of the kind share.\n\n\nAt first blush,\n (NAT*)\n seems to be a far cry from\n (NAT),\n the central claim of the tool analogy. But this impression might be\nmisleading. According to (NAT), a correct name for a given kind is a\nlinguistic device that has been created in a way that makes it fit for\npicking out the way of being that the members of this kind share. As\nhas just been indicated, picking out a way of being and indicating a\nway of being are the same act. Hence, (NAT) would appear to be\nequivalent to the claim that a correct name for a given kind must be\nsuited for indicating the way of being that the members of this kind\nshare. And clearly, (NAT*) does provide an explanation of how a name\ncan be suited for this act.\n\nThere is one more thing to note before we move on: As virtually all\ncommentators who take a closer look at 390e\u2013394e agree,\nSocrates\u2019 discussion of the name \u201cAstyanax\u201d is\npeppered with blatant mistakes. Proponents of\n Reading A\n and\n Reading C\n see this as Plato\u2019s way of discrediting\n (NAT*)\n (Heitsch 1984: 53\u201357; Eckl 2003: 135\u2013155; Ademollo 2011:\n146\u2013180); proponents of Reading B, on the other\nhand, need to bite the bullet and argue that Plato is simply not aware\nof Socrates\u2019 blunders (Sedley 2003: 75\u201386).\n6. The Etymological Section (394e\u2013421c)\n\nHaving arrived at the conjecture that there is a connection between\nthe correctness of names and their etymological meaning, Socrates\nbegins to uncover the etymological meaning of Greek names\u2014and\ndoes not stop until he has spent more than 25 Stephanus pages on\ndiscussing more than 100 names. Remarkably, his etymological analyses\ngradually take on a Heraclitean character; taken together, they\nsuggest that many Greek names encapsulate descriptions that would be\ntrue of the being of their referents if and only if Heraclitus were\nright in claiming that everything is in flux. The Greek name for\nexcellence, ar\u00eat\u00ea, is characterized as an\nabbreviation of the descriptive phrase \u201cthat which always\nflows\u201d (aei rh\u00eaon), for example (415c\u2013d);\nand the name for practical wisdom, phron\u00easis, is said\nto have the meaning \u201cunderstanding of movement and flux\u201d\n(ph\u00f4ras kai rhou no\u00easis) (411d). These and many\ncomparable analyses eventually lead Socrates to the conclusion that\nall (or at least many) Greek names must be built up from a small set\nof basic names that refer to movements and processes\u2014such as,\ne.g., the names ion, rhe\u00f4n, and doun.\nThis result, in turn, prompts him to augment his naturalist theory by\ninvestigating the correctness of these basic names.\n\nInsofar as the etymological section provides an incentive to complete\nthe naturalist theory of correctness, it has a clear dialectical\nfunction. But given its extraordinary length, this can hardly be its\nonly function. How else does the etymological section contribute to\nSocrates\u2019 inquiry, then? Three (non-exclusive) answers to this\nquestion suggest themselves:\n\nThe etymological section might shine a light on the prospects and\nproblems of etymological research.\nThe etymological section might make a point about the correctness\nof names.\nThe etymological section might draw attention to the ontological\nchallenge of Heracliteanism.\n\n\nThe present section zooms in on these possible answers.\n6.1 Prospects and Problems of Etymological Research\n\nThe Cratylus introduces its readers to two very different\nforms of etymological research. Socrates is engaged in one form of\netymological research when he tries to uncover the etymological\nmeaning of names; Cratylus is engaged in a different (if not\nindependent) form of etymological research when he later derives\nclaims about the being of the referents of a name from conjectures\nabout its etymological meaning (435d\u2013440e; see\n section 9).\n Taking one\u2019s cue from Sedley\u2019s universally accepted\ndistinction between the exegetical and the philosophical correctness\nof etymological analyses (Sedley 2003: 28), one might thus say that\nSocrates practices exegetical etymology and Cratylus\nphilosophical etymology.\n\nThe etymological section illustrates vividly that philosophical\netymology is a nonstarter. For it shows that one would just take over\nthe Heraclitean opinions of the ancient lawgivers if one relied on\nphilosophical etymology\u2014and as Socrates himself points out,\nthese opinions are mistaken (411b\u2013c). While this much is\nacknowledged by all commentators, matters are more complicated when it\ncomes to exegetical etymology. Some commentators point out that many\nof Socrates\u2019 etymological analyses are obviously absurd, and\nthat he punctuates these analyses with ironical remarks about his\nunusually inspired state (see, e.g., 396c\u2013397a or 410e) and with\nreflections on the methodological pitfalls of etymological research\n(414c\u2013415a and 418a\u2013b); they conclude that the\netymological section must be read as a parody of exegetical etymology\n(see, e.g., Schleiermacher 1824: 5\u20139; Heitsch 1984: 51; and\nTrivigno 2012). But other commentators object that Socrates\u2019\netymological analyses will have seemed much less absurd to ancient\nreaders than they appear to modern readers, and downplay the\nsignificance of his intermittent meta-observations. In their view,\nPlato does not make fun of exegetical etymology, but puts forward\nclaims that are at least \u201cbon\u00e2 fide guesses\u201d (Grote\n1865: 526) about the etymological meaning of names (see, e.g., Grote\n1865: 518\u2013529; Sedley 1998 and 2003; and Ademollo 2011:\n237\u2013256).\n\nAs this scholarly dispute is still unresolved, it is very hard to say\nwhich point the etymological section is supposed to make about\nexegetical etymology. One plausible minimalist assumption would seem\nto be that Socrates\u2019 etymological analyses suggest that\nexegetical etymology is not a science and does not lead to true\nknowledge. There are, to be sure, commentators who reject even this\nminimalist assumption (Sedley 2003: 41\u201350). But since it is\ncompatible with both the idea that Socrates\u2019 analyses are\n\u201cbon\u00e2 fide guesses\u201d and the claim that these\nanalyses are meant to parody exegetical etymology, it might be\nacceptable to a solid majority among scholars.\n6.2 Application or Subversion?\n\nWhich conclusion(s) about the correctness of names might the\netymological section suggest? Here is one possible answer to this\nquestion. Socrates\u2019 etymological analyses indicate that the\netymological meanings of many Greek names mirror mistaken Heraclitean\nassumptions about the being of their referents. It follows that many\netymologically complex names fail to indicate the being of their\nreferents by describing it. If one does not want to assume that these\nnames are all incorrect, one is compelled to conclude that\netymologically complex names can be correct even if they encapsulate\ndescriptions that do not apply to the being of their referents. This\nconclusion is clearly incompatible with\n (NAT*)\u2014with\n the hypothesis, i.e., that a correct etymologically complex name for\na given kind needs to encapsulate a description of the way of being\nthat the members of this kind share. It is a very natural thought,\nthen, that the etymological section might be meant to discredit (NAT*)\nand the naturalist theory of which (NAT*) is part.\n\nThis elaboration of the idea that the etymological section makes a\npoint about the correctness of names appeals, unsurprisingly, to\nchampions of\n Reading A\n and\n Reading C.\n It is not the only possible elaboration of this idea, however. The\nalternative is to contend that Plato wants his readers to conclude\nthat many of the names under scrutiny are not correct. If one is\nwilling to commit oneself to this assumption, one is free to argue\nthat the etymological section does not discredit\n (NAT*),\n but applies this account of the correctness of names to assess the\ncorrectness of selected Greek names. On this interpretation, which\nobviously appeals to champions of\n Reading B,\n the etymological section relies on Socrates\u2019 naturalist theory\nof correctness to show that one should not place one\u2019s trust in\nthe correctness of actual Greek names.\n6.3 The Challenge of Heracliteanism\n\nWhat remains to be discussed is the idea that the etymological section\nis meant to draw attention to the ontological challenge of\nHeracliteanism. As it is clear from other dialogues like the\nTheaetetus that coming to grips with Heracliteanism is a\nphilosophical task of paramount importance for Plato, this idea is\nindeed plausible. But what, exactly, is the challenge of\nHeracliteanism? This is a very difficult and contested question. It is\nnot even clear how the notion of flux is to be construed. Some\ncommentators believe that for Plato, flux amounts to what Irwin has\ncalled \u201caspectual change\u201d (Irwin 1977). If that were true,\nthe claim that all things are in flux would be equivalent to the claim\nthat all things have opposing properties in different respects.\nHeracliteanism would then not be a theory that reduces reality to\ngenuine change and motion, but a position that is very close to (a\ncertain variety of) relativism (see, e.g., Sedley 2003:\n109\u2013112). It has also been claimed, however, that the\netymological section presents Heracliteanism as \u201ca robustly\nphysical theory according to which everything is engaged in\nspatial change, i.e. locomotion\u201d (Ademollo 2011: 233).\nIf that were the case, there would be a sharp distinction between\nHeracliteanism and relativism.\n\nIf it is controversial how the Heraclitean claim that everything is in\nflux should be construed\u2014can one at least be sure about\nPlato\u2019s assessment of this claim? He has Socrates disagree\nstrongly with Heraclitus in the etymological section (411b\u2013c);\nand later on, he has him postulate forms and thereby acknowledge the\nexistence of entities that are exempt from flux (439c\u2013440e).\nHence, Plato certainly takes Heraclitus and his followers to err\ninsofar as they overlook that there is a flux-less\nintelligible realm. But what about the sensible\nrealm\u2014the realm of the things that surround us? Might Plato not\nbelieve that these things are in flux and thus accept a restricted\nversion of Heracliteanism? The issue is once again contested: While\nsome commentators do indeed take the Cratylus to lend support\nto the venerable claim that Plato is a Heraclitean when it comes to\nsensible things (Gaiser 1974: 61\u201380; Barney 2001: 73; Sedley\n2003: 99\u2013122), it has been objected that Socrates seems to\nconsider Heracliteanism as \u201cwrong across the board\u201d in the\netymological section (Ademollo 2011: 207f.).\n\nAs these considerations show, the etymological section\u2019s\ntreatment of Heracliteanism leaves open many important questions. This\nis clearly no coincidence. Just like the whole Cratylus, the\netymological section is not aimed at providing a thorough metaphysical\ndiscussion of the ins and outs of Heracliteanism (this is, arguably,\nthe job of the Theaetetus). It illustrates, however, that\nsuch a discussion is of much greater necessity and consequence than an\ninquiry into the hidden meanings of names could ever be. And thus, it\ndovetails with the conclusion that Socrates reaches at the very end of\nhis investigation (440c\u2013d).\n7. Correctness and Imitation (421c\u2013427d)\n\nHaving discovered that many Greek names are built up from names like\nion, rhe\u00f4n, and doun, Socrates\nobserves that the process of etymological analysis must necessarily\nstop after finitely many steps. There must be \u201cfirst\nnames\u201d (prota onomata), then\u2014names that do not\nhave an etymological meaning in virtue of the fact that they are\ncomposed of other names (421c\u2013422c). Since ion,\nrhe\u00f4n, and doun seem to be among these\netymologically simple names, their correctness cannot\npossibly depend on their etymological meaning. Socrates thus finds\nhimself in a predicament: For his theory of the correctness of\netymologically complex names would be built on sand if it were\nimpossible to account for the natural correctness of etymologically\nsimple names (cf. 426a\u2013b). Hence, he decides to\n\u201cinvestigate in some other manner\u201d what the correctness of\nthese names \u201cconsists in\u201d (422b). The present section\nfocuses on this investigation.\n7.1 Indicating by Imitating\n\nSocrates assumes that etymologically simple names must meet the same\nstandard as etymologically complex names: They need to \u201cindicate\nwhat each of the beings is like\u201d (422d)\u2014which turns out to\nmean that they need to indicate the being of their referents (423e).\nHe argues that etymologically simple names can only meet this standard\nby imitating the being of their referents (422e\u2013423e).\nAnd thus, he arrives at this augmented version of\n (NAT*),\n his earlier account of the correctness of etymologically complex\nnames:\n\n(NAT**)\nIf an etymologically complex name is a correct name for a given\nkind, this is because its etymological meaning ensures that it\ndescribes and thus indicates the way of being (ousia) that\nthe members of this kind share; and if an etymologically simple name\nis a correct name for a given kind, this is because its composition\nfrom letters and syllables ensures that it imitates and thus indicates\nthe way of being that the members of this kind share.\n\n\n(NAT**)\n is a full-fledged, completely general theory of the correctness of\nnames. The most pressing question raised by this theory is probably\nhow exactly the imitation of a way of being by means of letters and\nsyllables is supposed to work. Socrates\u2019 answer to this question\npresupposes that individual letters or individual syllables resemble\nthe basic kinds of beings (424d\u2013425a); he takes this to ensure\nthat a combination of different letters and syllables can\nresemble\u2014and thus imitate\u2014any given way of being. Note\nthat Socrates does not take the resemblance between letters and\nsyllables on the one hand and the basic kinds of beings on the other\nhand to depend on the sound of these letters and syllables, but on the\nway in which the mouth and the tongue move in articulating them. For\nhim, imitation is not onomatopoetic, but \u201carticulatory\u201d\n(Ademollo 2011: 309\u2013311; cf. Belardi 1985: 33).\n\nSocrates\u2019 theory of the correctness of etymologically simple\nnames has its problems and omissions; it does not take into account,\ne.g., that the mimetic qualities of a name would probably not only\ndepend on the letters and syllables from which it is composed, but\nalso on the way in which these letters and syllables are arranged\n(Barney 2001: 105 n. 31). Characterizing etymologically simple names\nas imitations is nevertheless an ingenious attempt at filling the\nexplanatory gap left by\n (NAT*).\n7.2 An Ideal Language?\n\nHaving formulated\n (NAT**),\n Socrates seems to take up his original task of accounting for the\ncorrectness of concrete etymologically simple names like ion,\nrhe\u00f4n, and doun (424a\u2013b). But very soon,\nhe digresses: Instead of examining existing names, he expands on how a\nlawgiver should ideally go about creating names that imitate the being\nof their intended referents (424b\u2013425a). His explanation is\ndense and difficult, and a crucial\nsentence\u2014424d1\u20135\u2014is fraught with philological\nproblems. The basic idea seems to be that an ideal lawgiver would have\nto do four things:\n\nHe would have to provide a taxonomy of all the letters;\nhe would have to identify and distinguish those basic kinds of\nbeings to which all things can be traced back;\nhe would have to determine which letters or syllables resemble\nwhich basic kinds; and\nhe would have to form concatenations of letters and syllables that\nimitate the being of the nominanda.\n\n\nWhat Socrates sketches here is clearly a very ambitious research\nproject. Some parts of this research project\u2014the taxonomy of\nletters and, especially, the taxonomy of beings\u2014are certainly\nclose to Plato\u2019s heart; they are, after all, strongly\nreminiscent of the dialectical investigations that are conducted (or\nat least envisaged) in dialogues such as the Sophist, the\nStatesman, and the Philebus. It is less clear,\nhowever, whether Plato really believes that a linguistic lawgiver\nshould detect correlations between the two taxonomies and introduce\nnames that imitate the being of their referents on the basis of these\ncorrelations. Some commentators do indeed contend that the passage at\nhand contains Plato\u2019s recipe for the creation of an ideal\nlanguage. Most of these commentators\nare\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014adherents of\n Reading B\n (see, e.g., Anagnostopoulos 1973: 331f.; Baxter 1992: 80\u201385;\nand Barney 2011: 97). Other commentators\u2014usually proponents of\n Reading A\n and\n Reading C\u2014object\n that the language Socrates describes here would have no real\nadvantage over other possible languages, since its users would not be\nable to access and appropriate the system of knowledge it encodes\nunless they embark on their own philosophical investigation (see,\ne.g., Williams 1982: 92). These commentators conclude that the passage\n424b\u2013425a is meant to show that even a mimetically perfect\nlanguage would not be particularly useful\u2014and thus to discredit\n (NAT**).\n7.3 Reductio ad Absurdum?\n\nAt 425a, Socrates abruptly returns to his examination of individual\netymologically simple Greek names. He confesses that he is not up to a\nsystematic classification of both letters and beings, and that he will\nthus have to work with conjectures about the resemblance between\nletters and basic kinds of beings (425b\u2013426b). These conjectures\nappear \u201cabsolutely outrageous and ridiculous\u201d (426b) not\nonly to many scholars, but also to Socrates himself. What Socrates\nsuggests is, e.g., that the Greek letter rh\u00f4 (or, more\nprecisely, the way in which the mouth moves in articulating this\nletter) resembles movement (426c\u2013e), or that the letter\niota resembles fine things \u201cwhich should most go\nthrough everything\u201d (426e\u2013427a). Building on these and\nsimilar suggestions, he ascertains what many etymologically simple\nnames imitate\u2014that names like psychron or zeon\nimitate \u201cwhat is blowy\u201d (427a), for example.\n\nGiven the avowedly \u201coutrageous and ridiculous\u201d quality of\nSocrates\u2019 mimetological discussion, it might seem tempting to\nassume that Plato must be out to debunk the idea that a name\nqua concatenation of letters and syllables can resemble and\nimitate a way of being, and thus to discredit\n (NAT**).\n But while some proponents of\n Reading A\n and\n Reading C\n endorse this assumption (see, e.g., Heitsch 1984: 40\u201343;\nBelardi 1985: 39\u201341; and Trivigno 2012: 63\u201367), there is\nreason for doubt. What Socrates calls \u201coutrageous and\nridiculous\u201d is his attempt to spell out which letters and\nsyllables resemble which basic kinds of beings. But crucially, his\nself-critical remarks do not seem to be directed against the idea that\nthe imitation of a way of being by means of letters and syllables is\npossible in principle (Sedley 2003: 76; Ademollo 2011:\n313\u2013315). Whether Plato accepts or rejects this idea is very\nhard to tell from the passage at hand.\n8. Criticizing Naturalism (427d\u2013435d)\n\nOnce Socrates has concluded his discussion of individual\netymologically simple names, Hermogenes wants to know whether Cratylus\naccepts Socrates\u2019 account of the natural correctness of names.\nCratylus endorses this account wholeheartedly (427d\u2013428c).\nFearing that he might have fallen prey to some sort of self-deception,\nSocrates suggests revisiting his account together with Cratylus\n(428d). Cratylus agrees and takes over from Hermogenes as\nSocrates\u2019 interlocutor. It soon turns out that he is committed\nnot only to\n (NAT**),\n but to some very counterintuitive additional claims. He thus espouses\na radical version of the naturalist theory of correctness that\nSocrates has presented (428e\u2013430a). Socrates marshals a series\nof arguments against Cratylus\u2019 position\n(430a\u2013435b)\u2014and is led to a disappointingly vague\nconclusion about the correctness of names (435b\u2013d). This section\ntakes a closer look at this pivotal and difficult passage.\n8.1 Cratylus\u2019 Naturalism\n\nSocrates begins his discussion with Cratylus by observing that the\nproducts of craftsmen are usually of variable quality\n(428e\u2013429a). Cratylus denies that this principle applies to the\nproducts of (linguistic) lawgivers (429b). Even though he takes\netymologically simple names to be imitations, he thus commits himself\nto the following claim:\n\n(C1)\nNo name can be any better or worse than any other name.\n\n\nSocrates takes (C1) to imply that \u201call names have been set down\ncorrectly\u201d and asks Cratylus whether he accepts this implication\n(429b/c). Cratylus responds by endorsing a second claim (429c):\n\n(C2)\nA linguistic device is a name for its (conventional) referents if\nand only if it fulfils the standard of correctness described by\n (NAT**).\n\n\nAnd it soon turns out that there is yet another claim that Cratylus\nwants to defend (429c\u2013430a):\n\n(C3)\nIf a name is not a correct name for an object, it cannot possibly\nbe applied to this object (and thus be used to speak falsely).\n\n\nThese three claims are very counterintuitive, and Socrates immediately\nbegins to attack\n (C3)\n and\n (C1).\n His arguments against these two claims rely on the presupposition\nthat etymologically simple names are imitations and can thus be\ncompared to pictures. To refute (C3), Socrates observes that it is\npossible to assign a picture of a man to a woman, and that it should\ntherefore be equally possible to apply an etymologically simple name\nthat does not imitate the being of a given object to this object\n(430a\u2013431c). This suffices to show that one can speak falsely by\nmisapplying names. To debunk (C1), Socrates points out that if someone\nwere to produce an object that is perfectly like Cratylus in every\nrespect, this object would not be a picture of Cratylus, but a second\nCratylus (432a\u2013c). He infers from this that pictures can\nresemble the objects they depict only to a certain degree (432c/d).\nBut if resemblance comes in degrees, imitative success comes in\ndegrees, and qualitative differences between imitations must be\npossible. Consequently, qualitative differences between etymologically\nsimple names must be possible (433a).\n8.2 The Return of Convention\n\nSocrates\u2019 convincing arguments against\n (C1)\n and\n (C3)\n lead him to the interim conclusion that even if\n (NAT**)\n holds, etymologically simple correct names imitate the being of their\nreferents only in outline, but not perfectly (432d\u2013433b). His\nnext argument\u2014the so-called skl\u00earot\u00eas\nargument\u2014complements this interim conclusion by undermining\n (C2)\n and re-introducing convention into the picture. The basic\npremise of this argument is the following one:\n\n(P1)\nIf a convention ensures that a name is a means to indicate\n(d\u00ealoma) the being (ousia) of its\n referents,[3]\n the correctness of this name is conventional. (433d\u2013434a)\n\n\nSocrates\u2019 reliance on this premise is a bit surprising. After\nall, he had first introduced the concept of indication when he began\nto elaborate his naturalist theory of correctness at 390e\u2013394e;\nbut now, he is characterizing the assumption that names are used to\nindicate as a shared tenet of naturalism and conventionalism. He must\nbelieve, then, that conventionalism and naturalism do not differ in\ntheir account of the use to which speakers put names, but in their\naccount of what makes this use possible (Ademollo 2011:\n385\u2013388).\n\nAt any rate, Socrates moves on to apply\n (P1)\n to the name skl\u00earon\n (\u201chard\u201d).[4]\n He considers this name a correct etymologically simple name that can\nbe used to indicate the way of being that unites all hard\nthings\u2014hardness. Using the results of his earlier mimetological\ndiscussion of individual letters, he points out that while\nskl\u00earon contains one\nletter\u2014rh\u00f4\u2014that resembles hardness, it also\ncontains one letter\u2014lambda\u2014that resembles the\nopposite of hardness, softness (434c\u2013d). Hence,\nskl\u00earon contains as many letters that resemble the\nopposite of hardness as letters that resemble hardness; and\nconsequently, it cannot be a means to indicate hardness in virtue of\nbeing an imitation of hardness. He then introduces two more premises\nto show that skl\u00earon is such a means in virtue of a\nconvention:\n\n(P2)\nIf a convention ensures that a hearer understands that a speaker\nwho articulates the name skl\u00earon is thinking of\nhardness, then a convention ensures that skl\u00earon is a\nmeans to indicate the being of its referents (= hardness). (435a)\n(P3)\nA convention ensures that a hearer understands that a speaker who\narticulates the name skl\u00earon is thinking of hardness.\n(434e)\n\n\nCratylus does not object to any of this and is compelled to accept the\nfollowing conclusion:\n\n(CONV)\nThe correctness of the name skl\u00earon is conventional\n(435a\u2013b).\n\n\nThis argument is certainly plausible. What is very important to see is\nthat its conclusion is explicitly framed as a claim about the\ncorrectness of the name skl\u00earon. It thus\ncannot be right to assume (as, e.g., Williams 1982: 83) that Socrates\nshows only that skl\u00earon is a name for hardness in\nvirtue of a convention, but not that it is correct in virtue of a\nconvention. As a matter of fact, Socrates does not distinguish between\nnames and correct names at this crucial moment (Barney 2001: 137; cf.\nAdemollo 2011: 2\u20134). And consequently, his argument does not\nonly show that\n (C2)\n is wrong: It also demonstrates that\n (NAT**)\n cannot be true as it stands.\n8.3 Socrates\u2019 Conclusion\n\nHaving established\n (CONV),\n Socrates makes a more general claim that is apparently supposed to\nwrap up his whole investigation (435b):\n\n(CONV*)\nConvention contributes to the correctness of names.\n\n\nTo lend further support to this conclusion, Socrates argues that there\nwould be a problem if one did not assume that convention has\n\u201csome authority concerning the correctness\u201d of the names\nfor the natural numbers (435b/c). But as he does not elaborate on the\nnature of this problem, the precise purport of his argument is\ncontested (see, e.g., Sedley 2003: 142 and Robinson 1956: 117). He\ngoes on, in any case, to state that while \u201che likes the idea\nthat names are, as far as possible, similar to the objects\u201d\n(435c), he sees no alternative to accepting\n (CONV*).\n\n(CONV*)\n is Socrates\u2019 last word on the correctness of names\u2014and a\ndisappointingly vague claim. How can one make sense of Socrates\u2019\nconcluding remarks despite their vagueness? One option, favoured by\nchampions of\n Reading A,\n is to argue that Socrates understates the true result of his\ninvestigation when he formulates (CONV*). What he could conclude after\npresenting the skl\u00earot\u00eas argument, and what\nPlato\u2019s readers are supposed to work out for themselves, is that\nthe correctness of all names is completely conventional. For while the\nskl\u00earot\u00eas argument and its conclusion (CONV)\nconcern only one name, it seems obvious that this argument could be\ngeneralized and would then vindicate a thoroughly conventionalist\nview. (To see why this may seem obvious, take another look at the\npremises of the skl\u00earot\u00eas argument.\n (P1)\n is about all correct names, and\n (P2)\n does not seem to concern the name skl\u00earon in\nparticular. But even when it comes to\n (P3),\n which is specifically about skl\u00earon as a name that\ndoes not successfully imitate hardness, a generalization seems to be\nwarranted. For even if it is granted that a given name succeeds at\nimitating hardness or any other way of being, it will still not seem\nto be this imitative success which guarantees that a hearer\nunderstands what a speaker is thinking of when using the name. As only\na shared convention would seem to ensure such understanding, (P3)\nappears to convey an insight that applies to all correct names. And if\none combines this insight with (P1) and a generalized version of (P2),\none will arrive at the conclusion that the correctness of all names is\ncompletely conventional.)\n\nBut of course, one could also take Socrates\u2019 endorsement of the\nvague\n (CONV*)\n to indicate that he is not convinced that the correctness of all\nnames is completely conventional and wants to stick to a suitably\nmodified version of\n (NAT**).\n This alternative assessment of Socrates\u2019 concluding remarks,\nwhich is favoured by champions of\n Reading B,\n can be elaborated in different ways. It has been argued, for\ninstance, that the skl\u00earot\u00eas argument concerns\nonly those names which\u2014like the name\nskl\u00earon\u2014contain letters that resemble a certain\nway of being and an equal number of letters that resemble the opposite\nway of being. While Socrates does indeed acknowledge that convention\nis crucial for the correctness of those names, he believes\nthat the correctness of all other names is completely dependent on\ntheir mimetic qualities or their etymological meaning (Sedley 2003:\n144f.). But the skl\u00earot\u00eas argument has also been\ntaken to show only that names fulfil some sort of minimal condition\nfor correctness in virtue of a convention, and thus to be compatible\nwith the idea that the degree of a name\u2019s correctness is a\nfunction of its mimetic qualities or its etymological meaning (Barney\n2001: 134\u2013142). There may be yet other elaborations of the idea\nthat Socrates\u2019 concluding remarks do not amount to a total\nrepudiation of\n (NAT**).\n They must all agree, however, in characterizing the import of the\nskl\u00earot\u00eas argument as more limited than it might\nappear to be.\n\nIs it also possible to maintain that Socrates rejects\n (NAT**)\n at 435b\u2013d, but not the more general claim that there is a\nnatural correctness of names? This is obviously how champions of\n Reading C\n would have to read Socrates\u2019 concluding remarks. Unfortunately,\nthere is no in-depth discussion of these remarks by any proponent of\nthis reading (see, however, Kretzmann 1971: 138, for some reflections\non the issue). Two conjectures about the shape that the suggested\ninterpretation would have to take seem reasonable, however:\n\nProponents of\n Reading C\n would have to read Socrates\u2019 official conclusion\n (CONV*)\n as the claim that while there is a natural correctness of names, the\nways in which correct names are composed of letters and syllables is\nconventional (see\n section 4.3).\nTo defend such an assessment of (CONV*), it would be necessary to\nexplain how the skl\u00earot\u00eas argument can justify a\nwholesale rejection of\n (NAT**)\n and yet fail to show that the correctness of all names is completely\nconventional.\n\n\nChoosing between these exegetical options is exceedingly difficult.\nThe fact that Socrates avowedly \u201clikes the idea that names are,\nas far as possible, similar to the objects\u201d might be thought to\nprove that he does not completely reject\n (NAT**).\n But a different reading is available: Socrates could be expressing\nthe conviction that most (etymologically simple) names are indeed\nsimilar to their referents while steering clear of the claim that this\nsimilarity constitutes their correctness (Ademollo 2011: 415). It is\ntrue, however, that it is not easy to make sense of 435b\u2013d, and\nespecially of the vague\n (CONV*),\n if one takes Socrates to believe that the correctness of all names is\ncompletely conventional. But on the other hand, it is harder to do\njustice to the skl\u00earot\u00eas argument if one does not\nascribe this belief to Socrates. Given the mixed signals Socrates\nsends, the debate about his conclusion is not likely to end anytime\nsoon.\n9. Coda: The \u201cPower\u201d of Names (435d\u2013440e)\n\nAs soon as Socrates has concluded his investigation of the correctness\nof names, he turns to a different (if closely related) topic and asks\nCratylus what the \u201cpower\u201d (dynamis) of names is.\nCratylus answers that names have the power to teach (435d). While this\nis reminiscent of Socrates\u2019 earlier contention that names are\ninstruments for teaching (388b\u2013c), it soon turns out that\nCratylus has something more radical in mind. What he wants to defend\nis the claim that analysing names is the only way of gaining knowledge\nabout their referents\u2019 being. For him, philosophical etymology\n(see\n section 6.1)\n and mimetological studies are thus not a, but the\npath to knowledge. Socrates objects by making an observation that is\nillustrated well by his earlier etymological and mimetological\ndiscussions: that examining names will at the very best lead one to\nthe opinions of the ancient lawgivers who have introduced the names,\nand that these opinions can be wrong (436a\u2013b). Cratylus has a\nresponse: He argues that the opinions of the ancient lawgivers are\ncoherently Heraclitean in character, and that this coherence\nguarantees their truth (436b\u2013c). Unimpressed, Socrates retorts\nthat coherence does not guarantee truth (436c\u2013d) and that there\nare also some cases in which the analysis of names suggests that the\nancient lawgivers held decidedly un-Heraclitean opinions\n(436d\u2013437d). He also points out that the knowledge that Cratylus\nascribes to the ancient lawgivers cannot\u2014on pain of\nregress\u2014have resulted from an examination of names\n(438a\u2013d).\n\nAll in all, Socrates presents a very compelling case against\nCratylus\u2019 conviction that one needs to analyse names in order to\nlearn anything about reality. But he also draws a positive conclusion\nfrom his reflections: It must be possible \u201cto learn about the\nbeings without names\u201d (438e). The purport of this conclusion is\nnot immediately clear. One might think that Socrates means to\nadvertise some sort of intuitive, non-linguistic understanding (see,\ne.g., Derbolav 1972: 201\u2013207; Silverman 2001: 25f.). But that\nseems implausible; for Socrates will soon go on to use names to gain\ninsight into the nature of reality. According to a more plausible\ninterpretation, Socrates wants to claim that one should examine things\ninstead of names, but not that one should refrain from using names\nwhen investigating (Sedley 2003: 162; Ademollo 2011: 445). He might\nalso have a special mode of inquiry in mind when he says that it must\nbe possible to learn without names: He might be thinking of a broadly\ntranscendental inquiry that aims at ascertaining how reality must be\norganized if language and knowledge are to be possible (Thomas\n2008).\n\nWhatever Socrates\u2019 exact theoretical point is when he suggests\nan \u201cinquiry without names\u201d\u2014he very soon starts his\nown investigation into the nature of reality, arguing that Heraclitus\ncannot be right when he claims that everything is in flux. His case\nagainst this claim is based on the presupposition that there are not\nonly beautiful or good things, but also the beautiful itself or the\ngood itself (439c\u2013d)\u2014Platonic forms, it would seem. As\nSocrates points out, four absurd consequences follow if one assumes\nthat even these entities are in constant flux:\n\nOne could not make true statements about them, because they would\nchange while one speaks (439d);\nthey would not be anything, because being something presupposes\nstaying in the same state for some time (439d\u2013e);\nthey would not be knowable, because they would change before one\ncould get to know them (439e\u2013440a); and\nthere would be no knowledge, because knowledge itself would be in\nconstant flux (440a\u2013b).\n\n\nThese arguments against Heraclitus\u2019 theory of flux are very\ncompressed and leave open many questions. Fittingly, Socrates admits\nthat he is not sure whether he has really established that Heraclitus\nis wrong in claiming that everything is in flux and declares that the\nissue should be investigated more thoroughly without relying on\nphilosophical etymology (440c\u2013d). Cratylus, on the other hand,\nis still convinced that Heraclitus is right (440d\u2013e).\nAccompanied by Hermogenes, he leaves for the countryside\u2014and\nends the dialogue that bears his name.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["A.
