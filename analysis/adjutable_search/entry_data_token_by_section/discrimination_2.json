    "main_text": "The Concept of Discrimination || The Moralized Concept\n1.2 The Moralized Concept\n\n\nThe concept of discrimination is inherently normative to the extent\nthat the idea of disadvantage is a normative one. But it does not\nfollow from this point that discrimination is, by definition, morally\nwrong. At the same time, many\u2014or even most\u2014uses of the\nterm \u2018discrimination\u2019 in contemporary political and legal\ndiscussions do employ the term in a moralized sense. Wasserman is\nusing this moralized sense, when he writes that \u201c[t]o claim that\nsomeone discriminates is \u2026 to challenge her for justification;\nto call discrimination \u2018wrongful\u2019 is merely to add\nemphasis to a morally-laden term\u201d (1998: 805). We can, in fact,\ndistinguish a moralized from a non-moralized concept of\ndiscrimination. The moralized concept picks out acts, practices or\npolicies insofar as they wrongfully impose a relative\ndisadvantage on persons based on their membership in a salient social\ngroup of a suitable sort.  The non-moralized concept simply dispenses\nwith the adverb \u2018wrongfully\u2019.\n\n\nAccordingly, the sentence \u2018Discrimination is wrong\u2019 can be\neither a tautology (if \u2018discrimination\u2019 is used in its\nmoralized sense) or a substantive moral judgment (if\n\u2018discrimination\u2019 is used in its non- moralized\nsense). And if one wanted to condemn as wrong a certain act or\npractice, then one could call it \u2018discrimination\u2019 (in the\nmoralized sense) and leave it at that, or one could call it\n\u2018discrimination\u2019 (in the non-moralized sense) and then add\nthat it was wrongful. In contexts where the justifiability of an\nact or practice is under discussion and disagreement, the moralized\nconcept of discrimination is typically the key one used, and the\ndisagreement is over whether the concept applies to the act.\nBecause of its role in such discussion and disagreement, the remainder\nof this article will be concerned with the moralized concept of\ndiscrimination, unless it is explicitly indicated otherwise.\n\n\nThere is an additional point that needs to be made in connection with\nthe wrongfulness of discrimination in its moralized sense. It is\nnot simply that such discrimination is wrongful as a conceptual\nmatter. The wrongfulness of the discrimination is tied to the\nfact that the discriminatory act is based on the victim\u2019s\nmembership in a salient social group. An act that imposes a\nrelative disadvantage or deprivation might be wrong for a variety of\nreasons; for example, the act might violate a promise that the agent\nhas made. The act counts as discrimination, though, only insofar\nas its wrongfulness derives from a connection of the act to the\nmembership in a certain group(s) of the person detrimentally affected\nby the act. Accordingly, we can refine the first-approximation\naccount of discrimination and say that the moralized concept\nof discrimination is properly applied to acts, practices or policies\nthat meet two conditions: a) they wrongfully impose a relative\ndisadvantage or deprivation on persons based on their membership in\nsome salient social group, and b) the wrongfulness rests (in part) on\nthe fact that the imposition of the disadvantage is on account of the\ngroup membership of the victims.\n",
