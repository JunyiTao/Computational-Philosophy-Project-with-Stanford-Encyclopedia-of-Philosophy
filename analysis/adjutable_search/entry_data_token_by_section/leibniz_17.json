    "main_text": "Metaphysics: Leibnizian Idealism || Panorganicism and Idealism\n5.2 Panorganicism and Idealism\n\n\nWhen Leibniz argues that bodies are the results of monads and that\nmatter itself is a phenomenon, he has something very specific in\nmind. First, in Leibniz's system there is a special kind of order\nin the natural world corresponding to a hierarchy of monads. Consider\nfirst a well-known comment that Leibniz makes to De Volder, introducing\na five-fold ontological scheme: \u201cI distinguish: (1) the primitive\nentelechy or soul; (2) the matter, namely, the primary matter or\nprimitive passive power; (3) the monad made up of these two things; (4)\nthe mass [massa] or secondary matter, or the organic machine in which\ninnumerable subordinate monads come together; and (5) the animal, that\nis, the corporeal substance, which the dominating monad makes into one\nmachine\u201d (G II 252/AG 177). One of the points Leibniz is making\nhere is that in an animal there is a dominant monad that bears a\nspecial relation to all the monads subordinate to it that make the\n\u201corganic machine\u201d of that animal. But, ultimately, the\npicture is even more complex than this, for each of the subordinate\nmonads can be considered as having an organic machine attached to it,\nand this relation continues on to the infinitely small. Thus, for\nexample, Leibniz writes in the Monadology \u00a770,\n\u201cThus we see that each living body has a dominant entelechy,\nwhich in the animal is the soul; but the limbs of this living body are\nfull of other living beings, plants, animals, each of which also has\nits entelechy, or its dominant soul\u201d (G VI 619/AG 222).\nSimilarly, in a letter to Bierling, he writes, \u201cAny mass contains\ninnumerable monads, for although any one organic body in nature has its\ncorresponding [dominant] monad, it nevertheless contains in its parts\nother monads endowed in the same way with organic bodies subservient to\nthe primary one; and the whole of nature is nothing else, for it is\nnecessary that every aggregate result from simple substances as if from\nelements\u201d (G VII 502). In other words, each monad will have an\norganic body which is in turn composed of other monads, each of which\nlikewise has an organic body. Similarly, any seemingly inanimate chunk\nof matter \u2013 a stone or, yes, a drop of urine \u2013 will be the\nresult of an infinity of monads and their organic bodies, which are\nnothing more than more monads and their organic bodies. This view is\nassociated with a panorganicist strand of Leibniz's\nthought. And it is for this reason that Leibniz will claim that\n\u201call of nature is full of life\u201d (Principles of Nature\nand Grace \u00a71: G VI 598/AG 207) and that \u201cthere are\ninfinite degrees of life in the monads\u201d (Principles of\nNature and Grace \u00a74: G VI 599/AG 208).\n\n\nSecond, there is what can best be described as a genuinely idealist\nstrand of Leibniz's thought. That is, if idealism is the thesis that\nthe only things that truly exist are minds and their ideas, then\nLeibniz clearly espouses this doctrine. Here the operative idea is\nthat bodies, and in particular the bodies associated with particular\nminds, are intentional objects \u2013 though they result from or are\ngrounded in monads. This is what Leibniz is getting at in the\nfollowing passage from another letter to De Volder: \u201cconsidering\nthe matter carefully, we must say that there is nothing in things but\nsimple substances, and in them, perception and appetition. Moreover,\nmatter and motion are not substances or things as much as they are the\nphenomena of perceivers, the reality of which is situated in the\nharmony of the perceivers with themselves (at different times) and\nwith other perceivers\u201d (G II 270/AG 181). Thus, the only real\nthings are simple substances; the bodies that we perceive in motion\naround us are phenomena and not themselves substances, though they are\ngrounded ultimately in simple substances or monads. Furthermore, the\nbodies of the natural world ought be considered intentional objects in\nthat they are objects about which we have certain beliefs. This is\nwhat Leibniz means in saying that they have reality insofar as there\nis a harmony between perceivers or between the same perceivers'\nbeliefs or perceptions at different times. In other words, one's body\nor even a stone is real because it is an object of perception that\nfits into an account of the world that is both coherent from the point\nof view of the single perceiver and in harmony with the perceptions of\nother minds.\n",
