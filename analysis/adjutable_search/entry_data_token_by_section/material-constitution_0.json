    "main_text": "The Puzzles\n1. The Puzzles\n\nPuzzles of material constitution played an important role in the\ndevelopment of philosophy and continue to be a source of much debate\ntoday. Here, we introduce four of the most famous puzzles.\n\nThe Debtor\u2019s Paradox. The ancient playwright Epicharmus\ntells the tale of a poor but resourceful debtor. When approached for\npayment, the man responds with a riddle. If you add a pebble to a\ncollection of pebbles, you no longer have the same number. If you add\na length to a cubit, you no longer have the same measure. In the same\nway, if you add a bit of matter to an existing portion of matter, you\nno longer have the same entity. Since man is nothing more than a\nmaterial object whose matter is constantly changing, we do not survive\nfrom one moment to the next. The debtor concludes that he is not the\nsame person who incurred the debt, so he cannot be held responsible\nfor the payment. The exasperated creditor then strikes the debtor, who\nprotests the abusive treatment. The creditor expresses sympathy, but\npoints out that he cannot be held accountable for the assault. After\nall, material change has already taken place so, by the debtor\u2019s\nown line of reasoning, the guilty party is no longer present. The\nscene is intended to be comedic, but the argument is no laughing\nmatter. The man who incurred the debt was constituted by one portion\nof matter, M1. The man who is approached for payment is\nconstituted by a distinct portion of matter, M2 (let us\nassume, for the sake of argument, that M2 consists of\nM1, together with some new matter). If constitution is\nidentity, then the debtor\u2019s reasoning is sound: the man\napproached for payment is not the man who incurred the debt. More\ngenerally, this version of the argument would show that it is\nimpossible for material objects to survive the addition of any new\nparts. (Note: the claim that constitution is identity should not be\nconfused with the thesis of \u201ccomposition as identity\u201d. On the latter\nview, see Section 8 of the entry on\n identity.)\n\nThe Puzzle of Dion and Theon. The Stoic philosopher\nChrysippus asks us to consider the case of Dion and Theon, where Dion\nis a normal human being and Theon is a large part of Dion consisting\nof everything but Dion\u2019s right foot. Suppose now that the right\nfoot is removed. Theon obviously survives the operation, for his parts\nremain completely unchanged. But, in that case, it seems as if Dion\ndoes not survive the operation, for otherwise we would have\ntwo people in the same place at the same time. Hence, Dion does not\nsurvive the loss of his foot. More generally, the argument would show\nthat material objects cannot survive the loss of any constituent\nparts. (A modern version of the puzzle, due to Peter Geach, concerns\nTibbles and Tib, where Tibbles is a cat and Tib a cat-part consisting\nof everything but Tibbles\u2019s tail.)\n\nThe Ship of Theseus Puzzle. The ancient historian Plutarch\nrecounts the story of the famous ship of Theseus, whose parts were all\ngradually replaced as they wore down. The resulting ship was\neventually displayed in Athens, where philosophers debated whether it\nwas still the original ship of Theseus, despite having none of the\noriginal parts. In the modern era, Thomas Hobbes added a further twist\nto the story. Suppose that a custodian collected the original planks\nas they were removed from the ship and later put them back together in\nthe original arrangement. In this version of the story, we are left\nwith two seafaring vessels, one on display in Athens and one in the\npossession of the custodian. But where is the original Ship of\nTheseus? Some will say that the ship is with the museum, since ships\ncan survive the complete replacement of parts (provided, at least,\nthat the change is sufficiently gradual). Others will say that the\nship is with the custodian, since ships can survive being disassembled\nand reassembled. Both answers seems correct, but this means that, at\nthe end of the story, the ship of Theseus is in two places at once.\nMore generally, the argument suggests that it is possible for one\nmaterial object to exist in two places at the same time. We get an\nequally implausible result by working backwards. After all, there are\nclearly two ships at the end of the story, but both ships were also\naround at the beginning, for the reasons just given. So, at the\nbeginning of the story, there were two ships of Theseus occupying the\nsame place at the same time\u2014one of which would go on to the\nmuseum and one of which would end up with the custodian.\n\nThe Puzzle of the Statue and the Clay. Various ancient\nphilosophers, including Aristotle, pointed out that statues seem to\ndiffer in important respects from the portions of matter from which\nthey are made. Suppose that, on Monday, a sculptor purchases an\nunformed lump of clay, which he names \u2018Lump\u2019. Suppose\nfurther that, on Tuesday, the artist sculpts the clay into the form of\nthe biblical king David and names his statue \u2018David\u2019. It\nis tempting to say that, in this case, there is only one object in the\nsculptor\u2019s hands\u2014David just is Lump. But, on\nreflection, this identification is problematic, since Lump and David\nseem to differ in many respects. For example, Lump existed on Monday,\nwhereas David did not. Moreover, Lump could survive being squashed\ntomorrow, whereas David could not. However, this would imply that Lump\nand David and numerically distinct entities, since Leibniz\u2019s Law tells\nus that numerical identity requires qualitiative sameness. The upshot,\nonce again, is that it is possible for two material objects to exist\nin the same place at the same time.\n\nThese four puzzles differ in details, but raise a common problem. (A\nfifth\n puzzle\u2014the problem of the many\u2014raises\n significantly different issues and is dealt with in a separate\nentry.) We will focus on the case of the statue and the clay, and we\nwill formulate the puzzle as follows:\n\nDavid did not exist on Monday (but does exist on Tuesday).\nLump did exist on Monday (and also exists on Tuesday).\nIf (1) and (2), then David is not identical to Lump.\n[So] David is not identical to Lump.\n\n\nThe premises of the argument are plausible, but the conclusion is\nproblematic, for it implies the possibility of spatially\ncoincident objects\u2014something that we ordinarily take to be\nimpossible.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are five possible replies to this puzzle.\nFirst, one could simply accept (4) and admit that David is not\nidentical to Lump. We consider this response in sections 2 and 3,\nwhere we discuss the constitution view of David Wiggins\n(1968) and the temporal parts theory of David Lewis (1976).\nSecond, one could deny (1) by either denying the existence of David or\nby insisting that David existed on Monday. We consider these responses\nin section 4, where we discuss the eliminativist views of\nPeter Unger (1979), Peter van Inwagen (1990), and Roderick Chisholm\n(1979). Third, one could deny (2) by either denying the existence of\nLump (as the eliminativist does) or by claiming that Lump does not\nsurvive being shaped into a statue. We consider this second option in\nsection 5, where we discuss the dominant kinds view of\nMichael Burke (1992). Fourth, one could deny (3) by rejecting the\nstandard formulation of Leibniz\u2019s Law. We consider this response\nin section 6, where we discuss the relative identity theory\nof Peter Geach (1967). Fifth and finally, one could respond to the\nparadox by insisting that the underlying issues are in some sense\nverbal, so that there is no fact of the matter about which premise (if\nany) is false. We consider this response in section 7, where we\ndiscuss the deflationist views of Rudolf Carnap (1950) and\nothers. (For an alternative survey of these issues, along with a\ncollection of relevant papers, see Rea 1987.)\n\nNote that, while our focus throughout will be on material objects,\nsimilar problems arise for other kinds of entities, including events,\nproperties, and groups\u2014see, for example, Pfeifer (1989),\nShoemaker (2003), and Uzquiano (2004a).\n",
