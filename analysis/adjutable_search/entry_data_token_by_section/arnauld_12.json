    "main_text": "Arnauld and Leibniz || Leibniz\u2019s notion of an individual substance\n5.1 Leibniz\u2019s notion of an individual substance\n\nProposition 8 in Leibniz\u2019s outline is: \u201cIn order to\ndistinguish the actions of God from those of creatures, it is\nexplained wherein consists the notion of an individual\nsubstance\u201d (LA,8). The notion of a substance is, for\nLeibniz, the notion of a thing that acts. To explain the notion of a\ncreated individual substance, therefore, he has to explain the notion\nof a created agent, which requires that he distinguish correctly\nbetween the actions of creatures and the actions of God. Part of\nLeibniz\u2019s account of the notion of an individual substance is\ngiven in Proposition 13: \u201cThe individual notion of each person\nincludes once and for all everything that will ever happen to\nhim,\u201d so that \u201cone sees in [that notion] a priori\nproofs of the truth of each event, that is, why one [event] has\noccurred rather than another\u201d (LA, 8). The debate\nbetween Arnauld and Leibniz begins here. Proposition 13, Arnauld said\nin his first letter to Leibniz, implies that \u201conce God decided\nto create Adam, everything that has happened since and will ever\nhappen to the human race was and is obliged to happen with a more than\nfatal necessity\u201d (LA, 27). For example, given\nproposition 13, if Adam exists, then necessarily Adam is father of\nCain and Abel as sons, grandfather of their children,\ngreat-grandfather of their children, etc., and everything that will\never happen to all of them is already determined.\n\nAfter a complicated three-way exchange of letters, Arnauld withdrew\nhis complaint in a letter dated September 28, 1686. At the outset,\nArnauld assumed that according to Leibniz whatever is contained in the\nindividual notion of a person is contained there as a necessary\nproperty of the person. But in response to Arnauld, Leibniz says that\nhe does not \u201cask for more of a connection here\u201d than that\nwhich obtains between an individual substance and its \u201cexternal\ndenominations\u201d (LA, p. 56). Given this understanding of\nthe way that individual notion of a person contains everything that\nwill ever happen to him, Arnauld was prepared to concede that\nLeibniz\u2019s position did not involve fatalism (LA,\n63\u201364).\n\nArnauld adds that he continues to have difficulty with Leibniz\u2019s\naccount of \u201cthe possibility of things\u201d and his conception\nof God as choosing the actual world out of an infinity of possible\nworlds, a point on which Leibniz agreed with Malebranche, and he asks\nLeibniz to clarify his \u201chypothesis of concomitance or agreement\nbetween substances,\u201d and his statement that if a material thing\nis not merely an appearance, like a rainbow, or an accidental\naggregation of parts, like a pile of stones, it must have a\n\u201csubstantial form.\u201d Leibniz had mentioned both of these\npoints in his immediately preceding letter (LA, 64\u201366,\n58). According to the hypothesis of concomitance no created substance\never acts upon any other created substance. But every later state of\nany given created substance is caused by an earlier state of the same\nsubstance, and the histories of the individuals are coordinated by God\nso that they fit together into the history of the actual world.\nLeibniz also says that one substance, x, may\n\u201cexpress\u201d another substance, y, more distinctly\nthan y expresses x, and in that case, one may say\nthat x causes changes to occur in y. He uses this\nposition to explain the relation of mind and body. Arnauld asked him\nto explain his view further by applying it to the example of a man who\nfeels pain when his arm is wounded, and the example of a man wants to\ntake off his hat and raises his arm. Arnauld also raises seven\nobjections to Leibniz\u2019s claims about substantial forms\n(LA, 66\u201367) and defends the Cartesian view that\nextension is the real nature of matter, which he takes to imply that\nbodies have only varying degrees of \u201cimproper unity\u201d\n(LA, 88).\n\nLeibniz provided the further clarification Arnauld requested in\nseveral long letters, which drew two replies from Arnauld. Arnauld\ncontinued to find Leibniz\u2019s position unclear. \u201cI have no\nclear notion,\u201d says Arnauld,\n\nof what you mean by the word \u2018expression\u2019, when you say\nthat our soul expresses more distinctly (all other things being equal)\nwhat pertains to its body, since it is an expression even of the whole\nuniverse in a certain sense. (LA, 105)\n\n\nHe takes Leibniz\u2019s views about substantial forms to be a strange\nand unsuccessful attempt \u201cto ascribe true unity to bodies [in\nparticular the bodies of animals] which would not otherwise have\nit\u201d (LA, 107).\n\nArnauld\u2019s last letter to Leibniz is dated August 28, 1687.\nLeibniz tried to get Arnauld to continue the discussion, but Arnauld\nwas fully occupied with other projects. On August 31, 1687, Arnauld\nwrote to Hessen-Rheinfels, saying,\n\nIt would be preferable if [Leibniz] gave up, at least for a time, this\nsort of speculation, and applied himself to the greatest business he\ncan have, the choice of the true religion\u2026 a decision that is\nof such importance for his salvation. (LA, 110)\n\n5.2 Arnauld\u2019s criticism of Leibniz\u2019s Modal Metaphysics; Arnauld\u2019s alternative\n\nEric Stencil has provided a general discussion of the disagreement\nbetween Leibniz and Arnauld about Modal Metaphysics. \u201cModal\nmetaphysics,\u201d Stencil says, \u201cis the theory of possibility,\nnecessity, essence and God\u2019s relation to each\u201d (Stencil.\n2016, p. 2). Arnauld attacks Leibniz\u2019s thesis that the\nindividual concept of each person contains once for all everything\nthat will ever happen to him, Leibniz\u2019s claim that there are\n\u201cpurely possible\u201d substances, and his associated view that\nGod creates by choosing one from a multitude of possible worlds.\nStencil argues that Arnauld\u2019s criticisms are based on a positive\nview which Stencil describes as \u201ca sophisticated essence-based\nmodal actualism,\u201d containing three theses: (1) Everything that\nexists is actual (ontological actualism). (2) The actual world is\nirreducibly modal; there is no reductive analysis of modality (modal\nactualism). (3) All true de re counterfactuals are grounded\nin the irreducibly modal essences of actually existing things\n(essence-based modal actualism) (Stencil, 2016, p. 2\u20133). Stencil\nsays that Arnauld\u2019s view \u201ccould be developed into a\nplausible view in its own right\u201d and that,\n\nwhen divorced from its theological motivations and with several\nimportant augmentations, could serve as a foundation for a plausible\nview that deserves to be considered in contemporary debates concerning\nmodal metaphysics. (p. 21)\n\n6. Arnauld\u2019s Compatibilism\n\nThroughout his enormously active life as a philosopher and theologian,\nArnauld was above all concerned to defend the doctrine that human\nbeings, after the fall of Adam, can perform meritorious actions, but\nonly if the actions are the result of a supernatural gr\u00e2ce\nefficace par elle-m\u00eame. Arnauld claimed to find this\ndoctrine in the writings of both Augustine and Aquinas and he defended\nJansen\u2019s version of it against the charge of heresy, even though\nJansen\u2019s version was significantly different from that espoused\nby Arnauld himself. But Arnauld, like Augustine, Aquinas, and Jansen,\nalso held that actions are meritorious only if they are free.\nFor this reason, Arnauld is sometimes said to be a\n\u201ccompatibilist.\u201d For example, Robert Sleigh says,\n\u201cIt is worth noting that Leibniz and Arnauld both ascribed\ncompatibilism to St. Thomas and that both accepted compatibilism as\nwell\u201d (Sleigh 1990, 29).\n\nThe position Arnauld defended and attributed to Augustine and Aquinas\nis, however, quite different from what is nowadays referred to as\n\u201ccompatibilism.\u201d The position is connected with\nArnauld\u2019s treatment of free will during the last decade of his\nlife, at the time when he was wrestling with Malebranche\u2019s\ntheory of nature and grace. At that time, Arnauld developd the\nposition that the human will is free when and only when it is a\n\u201cpotestas ou facultas ad opposita.\u201d But\nfirst, it is necessary to provide some background for the notion of\ngr\u00e2ce efficace par elle-m\u00eame.\n6.1 The Congregationes de Auxiliis and seventeenth-century controversy about grace\n\nThe point of departure for the disputes about grace and free will in\nseventeenth-century Europe was the inconclusive ending of the\nCongregationes de Auxiliis Divinae\n Gratiae.[31]\n These were ad hoc committees of Cardinals convoked to\nresolve a dispute between the Jesuits and Dominicans about grace,\npredestination, and free will. The dispute was concerned with a work\nby the Jesuit Luis de Molina, whose lengthy title indicates the scope\nand complexity of the dispute: Concordia Liberi Arbitrii\ncum Gratia Donis, Divina Praescientia, Providentia, Praedestinatione\net Reprobatione ad Nonnullos Primae Partis Divi Thomae Articulos\n(The Agreement of Free will with the Gift of Grace, Divine\nForeknowledge, Providence, Predestination and Reprobation, according\nto several articles in the First Part of St. Thomas). The work\nwas published in 1588 and was immediately attacked by the Dominican\nschool of Salamanca, led by Domingo Ba\u00f1ez. The\nCongregationes were convoked by Pope Clement VIII with the\naim of resolving what had become a widespread struggle between the two\norders. His hope was frustrated; the meetings began on January 2, 1598\nand were terminated on August 28, 1607 (the feast day of St.\nAugustine!) by Pope Paul V, who declared that neither side was\nheretical and that both sides had merit.\n\nA central question at the meetings of the Congregationes had\nto do with the relation of supernatural grace to free, meritorious\nacts of will. It was assumed on both sides that a human being cannot\nperform a meritorious act of will without supernatural assistance from\nGod, that God sometimes gives such assistance, and that it is\nsometimes part of God\u2019s providential plan that the recipient\nfreely cooperate and thus perform the act in question. Meritorious\nacts of will include, among others, the decision to pray, to seek\nforgiveness for past sins, and to perform a good action for the love\nof God. It was assumed by both Jesuits and Dominicans that God\u2019s\nprovidential plan is infallibly realized. Hence both sides agreed that\nsupernatural grace is, in at least some cases, infallibly\nefficacious (Vansteenberghe 1928, #2140). The issue was\nwhether the supernatural grace in question is efficacious by\nitself, in other words, intrinsically efficacious, or\nwhether it is efficacious only by virtue of the independent, divinely\nforeknown cooperation of the one who receives the grace\n(Vansteenberghe 1928, #2154\u201365). Several sorts of supernatural\ngrace were distinguished. For our purposes, the most important\ndistinctions are (a) between habitual grace (especially the\ntheological virtues of faith, hope, and charity) and actual grace; (b)\nbetween external actual grace (e.g., hearing a good sermon) and\ninternal actual grace (grace consisting in internal, mental acts); and\n(c) between internal actual grace of the intellect and internal actual\ngrace of the will. The question was whether the actual grace of the\nwill that infallibly produces a meritorious act of will is efficacious\nby itself, or whether instead its efficaciousness is explained in part\nby God\u2019s knowledge that the recipient would cooperate with the\ngrace.\n6.2 Ba\u00f1ez, Jansen, and Arnauld on the nature of efficacious actual grace of the will\n\nJansen and Arnauld, like Ba\u00f1ez, defended the position that\nactual grace of the will is sometimes intrinsically\n efficacious.[32]\n But they disagreed about the nature of such grace. According to\nBa\u00f1ez, efficacious grace is the supernatural counterpart of\n\u201cphysical premotion.\u201d The elusive notion of physical\npremotion is part of a general account of God\u2019s causation of the\nactions of creatures. According to this account, God is a cause of a\ncreature\u2019s action by bringing about in the creature a\n\u201cpremotion\u201d that results in the creature\u2019s carrying\nout the action in question. For Ba\u00f1ez, then, the actual grace\nin question is a sort of supernatural beginning of volition that is\nproduced in the human being by God and that infallibly results in a\nmeritorious act of will. Jansen rejected this notion, arguing that it\nis an obscure hypothesis that explains nothing. He held that\nefficacious grace is, instead, a feeling of love, which he called a\n\u201cdelectatio victrix (victorious pleasure)\u201d and\nwhich infallibly leads to a meritorious act.\n\nArnauld accepted neither of those views. In a work published in 1656,\nhe considers two positions on the nature of efficacious grace, in so\nfar as it is the principle of good will: \u201cSome say that such\ngrace consists in the mercy of God and in an inherent form [in the\ncreature],\u201d while others say that it consists \u201conly in the\nmercy of God, which brings about (operatur) the interior\nmovement of the mind.\u201d Arnauld says \u201cI am not far\u201d\nfrom the second position, which he attributes to \u201cBradwardine,\nEstius, Tiphanius, and many other [Thomists]\u201d (Dissertatio\ntheologica quadripartita, OA, 20:237).\n\nWhen Arnauld returned to questions about efficacious grace and free\nwill toward the end of his life, he was more categorical:\n\nThe true opinion of St. Augustine, St. Bernard, and St. Thomas\nconcerning actual grace, is that of Estius, who posits nothing created\nby God in the will in between the will of God, which he calls\nuncreated grace, and the free movement of the human will which the\nuncreated grace produces in the human will.\n\n\nJansen was \u201csurely mistaken,\u201d Arnauld adds, when he\ndefined actual grace as a non-deliberate \u201cvictorious\npleasure\u201d (Letter to du Vaucel, 8 May 1693, OA,\n 3:636).[33]\n In a short treatise on human freedom written almost a decade earlier,\nArnauld illustrates his criticism of Jansen (without mentioning him by\nname) with an example: \u201cSuppose that a man who is not very\ngenerous is approached by a beggar who asks him for alms. He\ndeliberates, proposes to himself the commandment of Christ, and gives\nalms for the sake of God\u201d (De la libert\u00e9 de\nl\u2019homme, OA, 10:620, hereinafter\nLibert\u00e9). Jansen assumes that there is a\nnon-deliberate act of victorious pleasure in between the man\u2019s\ndeliberation and his decision to give alms for the sake of God, and\nthat this non-deliberate pleasure is the actual grace that enables him\nto act in a meritorious way. Arnauld rejects this position and instead\nidentifies the efficacious grace with God\u2019s merciful will that\nthe man arrive at the deliberate decision to give alms for the sake of\nGod.\n\nYet Arnauld also assumed that the man\u2019s decision, like any\nmeritorious act of will, was free. Arnauld\u2019s basic position on\nthe compatibility of the intrinsic efficacy of grace with the freedom\nof the volitions produced by the grace, is that we know from Scripture\nand Tradition, supported by philosophical reflection on God\u2019s\nomnipotence (a) that the grace of Christ is intrinsically efficacious;\nand we know \u201cfrom our own experience\u201d (b) that our\nvolitions of the relevant kind are free. Hence we know that (a) and\n(b) are consistent, even though we have \u201cgreat difficulty\u201d\nin seeing how they fit together (OA, 10:436).\n6.3 The limits of Arnauld\u2019s compatibilism\n\nArnauld was, then, a compatibilist of sorts. The compatibilism he\nespoused and attributed to Aquinas, however, was limited, and differs\nin a number ways from the sort of position philosophers now label\n\u201ccompatibilism.\u201d\n\n1. Arnauld was not a determinist, nor did he attribute determinism to\nSt. Thomas. Arnauld cites Aquinas (Summa Theologicae I, 19,\n3) as an authority in favor of his own view that God\u2019s will with\nregard to creatures is not necessary (OA, 39:598).\n\n2. Arnauld held that freedom of human volitions is\nincompatible with the determination of the choices by laws of\nnature together with temporally antecedent events. Thus he responds to\nMalebranche\u2019s statement that the destruction of Jerusalem by the\nRomans some seventy years after the death of Jesus was \u201ca\nnecessary outcome of the laws of nature,\u201d by saying, \u201cIt\nis clear \u2026 that a long series of diverse events, that depended\non an infinity of free movements of the wills of men, could have been,\nand indeed were, regulated by the providence of Him who has an\nalmighty power to move the hearts of men, and to direct them as He\npleases \u2026 But it cannot be said that it was a necessary\nconsequence of the laws of nature without degrading human beings,\nmaking them act like lower animals, and depriving them of their\nliberty, a position that has been declared anathema by the\nCouncil of Trent\u201d (OA, 39:301). He repeats the\ncriticism a few pages later:\n\nAs I have shown above, to hold that events that depended on an\ninfinity of free volitions of human beings were a necessary\nconsequence of laws of nature is to deprive human beings of their\nfreedom, after the example of Wycliffe. (OA,\n 39:316).[34]\n\n\n3. According to the position Arnauld attributes to Aquinas, the\nsinful choices of human beings are not determined by any\ncause exterior to the sinner. Arnauld agreed with Aquinas that God is\nthe sole exterior cause of the volitions of a human being, that is,\nthe only efficient cause of volitions outside the human being himself\nor herself, but God never causes a person to sin. Arnauld cites\nSumma Theologiae, I\u2013IIae, 9, 6, ad 3, in which Aquinas\nanswers the objection that God cannot be the sole exterior cause of\nsinful choices. Aquinas says,\n\nGod, as the universal mover, moves the will of man to the universal\nobject of the will, which is the good. And without this universal\nmovement man cannot will anything; but man through reason determines\nhimself to will this or that, whether it be a true or only an apparent\ngood. Nevertheless God sometimes moves some men especially to will\nsomething determinate that is good (interdum movet Deus\nspecialiter aliquos ad aliquid determinat\u00e8 volendum quod est\nbonum), as in those He moves by grace. (Vera S. Thomae de\ngratia sufficiente et efficaci doctrina dilucide explanata,\nOA,\n 20:63).[35]\n\n\nArnauld\u2019s purpose in citing this text is to show that, according\nto Aquinas, when one sins, one is not moved by\n grace.[36]\n But the text, together with the premise that there is no exterior\ncause of human volition other than God, implies that sinful choices\nare not determined by any cause outside the sinner.\n6.4 Arnauld\u2019s late position on the nature of free will\n\nIn several letters toward the end of his life, Arnauld recommends a\n\u201clittle Latin text\u201d on human freedom that he wrote at the\ntime he was wrestling with Malebranche\u2019s theory of nature and\ngrace, saying that it is particularly helpful in connection with the\nproblem of reconciling intrinsically efficacious grace with freedom of\n will.[37]\n The core of Arnauld\u2019s new theory is that the human soul has\nfreedom of will with respect to a true or apparent good when it has\nthe power to will that good and the power not to will it. In such\ncases, the soul \u201cdetermines itself\u201d to will or not will\nthe good in question. The human soul is said to have this power with\nrespect to any particular good it apprehends, as long as the\nparticular good does not encompass all the good toward which the will\ntends. Arnauld cites I\u2013IIae, 13, 6 as part of the Thomistic origin of\nhis theory:\n\nMan does not choose of necessity. And this is because that which is\npossible not to be, is not of necessity\u2026. For man can will and\nnot will, act and not act; again, he can will this or that, and do\nthis or that. The reason of this is seated in the very power of the\nreason. For the will can tend to whatever the reason can apprehend as\ngood. Now the reason can apprehend as good, not only this, viz.\n\u201cto will\u201d or \u201cto act,\u201d but also this, viz.\n\u201cnot to will\u201d or \u201cnot to act.\u201d Again, in all\nparticular goods, the reason can consider an aspect of some good, and\nthe lack of some good, which has the aspect of evil: and in this\nrespect, it can apprehend any single one of such goods as to be chosen\nor to be avoided. The perfect good alone, which is happiness, cannot\nbe apprehended by the reason as an evil, or as lacking in any way.\nConsequently man wills happiness of necessity, nor can he will not to\nbe happy, or to be unhappy\u2026 Therefore man chooses not of\nnecessity, but freely. (cited at OA, 10:630\u201331)\n\n\nArnauld follows Aquinas in saying that the will is not free with\nregard to two objects, first, happiness, apprehended as the ultimate\nobject of volition, and, second, God, seen face to face by the blessed\nin heaven. In these two cases, one wills (or loves) the object with\n\u201cnecessity of nature,\u201d and hence not freely. In all other\ncases, the will is free, and when one wills, one does so\n freely.[38]\n Arnauld provides a compact formula for this theory: \u201cThe best\nand shortest notion one can have of free will is to say with St.\nThomas that it is a potestas ou facultas ad opposita\u201d\n(Letter to Bossuet, juillet 1693, OA,\n 3:662).[39]\n6.5 The advantages Arnauld claims for his new theory over Jansen\u2019s theory\n\nArnauld claims a number of advantages for his theory of free will over\nthat of Jansen. In particular, he claims that, when combined with the\naccount of the nature of grace that he found in Estius, it makes it\neasier to reconcile the intrinsic efficacy of grace with freedom.\n\nIn following [Estius\u2019s opinion regarding efficacious grace], it\nis much easier to explain the efficacy of the grace, and to reconcile\nit with freedom, especially when we define free will, following St.\nThomas, as a facultas ad opposita. (Letter to Bossuet,\njuillet 1694, OA, 3:664).\n\n\nExplaining the efficacy of grace is easier on Estius\u2019s theory\nthan on the competing theories, because it is simpler. On the\ncompeting theories, which include Jansen\u2019s, the efficacy of\nactual grace of the will depends on a connection of some sort, within\nthe mind of a creature, between a created grace, like Jansen\u2019s\n\u201cvictorious pleasure,\u201d and a meritorious choice.\nEstius\u2019s theory is simpler: The efficacy of actual grace is a\ndirect consequence of the general principle that God\u2019s absolute\nwill is infallibly realized.\n\nBut how does Estius\u2019s theory, combined with the account of free\nwill that Arnauld derived from St. Thomas, help to reconcile the\nefficacy of grace with free will? According to Jansen, freedom of will\nis the same as spontaneity, and so every act of will is essentially\nfree. Jansen qualifies that position by adding that during life here\non earth, human beings have another kind of freedom:\n\nThe freedom of man the pilgrim is not only exempt from constraint, but\neven from immutable voluntary necessity (necessitatis\nimmutabilis voluntariae), that it, this freedom is indifferent\nbetween doing good and doing evil, between acting and not acting.\n(Quoted by Arnauld in Seconde Apologie, OA, 17:242).\n\n\nWhen he says that the will is indifferent as between doing good and\ndoing evil, and between acting or not acting, during this life here\nbelow, Jansen means that during life on Earth, the will remains\nmutable or \u201cflexible\u201d between doing good and doing evil,\nand again, willing or not willing any particular action or end. In\nother words, the will is not confirmed in good or evil during this\nlife in such a way that it could not fall away from willing the good\nor be converted from willing what is evil, and again in such a way\nthat it could not cease willing what it does will or begin willing\nwhat it does not will.\n\nNow on theories like those of Jansen and Ba\u00f1ez, the intrinsic\nefficacy of grace involves the determination of a person\u2019s\nvolition by an antecedent state of his or her mind, and this seems to\nconflict with the proposition that the volition is free. On\nEstius\u2019s view, on the other hand, a person\u2019s meritorious\nvolition is determined not by an antecedent state of his or her mind,\nbut rather by the will of God. Is this an improvement, with respect to\nexplaining the compatibility of efficacious grace with free will?\nArnauld says it is, \u201cespecially when we define free will,\nfollowing St. Thomas, as a facultas ad opposita.\u201d\n\nHere Arnauld appeals to the Thomistic principle that when God causes a\ncreature to act, He always causes the creature to act in accordance\nwith its nature. Paraphrasing Aquinas (Summa Theologiae, I,\n82, 1, ad 3), Arnauld says,\n\nWhen God works our volition in us, He brings it about that we will in\nconformity with our nature, that is by determining ourselves to what\nwe are not determined by nature. Thus no matter with what efficacy the\nmind is moved by God, it acts as master of its very own action, and it\nwills because it wills, determining itself to all other things by its\nvolition to be happy, and hence it acts freely\n(Libert\u00e9, OA,\n 10:616).[40]\n\n\nArnauld\u2019s line of thought seems to be as follows: Human beings\nare attracted to limited goods only as means to the unlimited good of\nhappiness. Therefore, whenever a human being is attracted to a limited\ngood, he or she can attend to its goodness and will it, or attend to\nsome way in which it falls short of the unlimited good and refrain\nfrom willing it. Which of these options is realized is determined by\nthe human being, or more precisely, the human being\u2019s mind;\nthus, in willing or not willing any limited good, the human mind is\nself-determining and free. All this is part of the nature of the human\nmind. So if God moves the human mind to will a limited good, He moves\nit to will in a self-determining and free way.\n\nIf pressed for more details about how God by His merciful will\n(uncreated grace) moves a human being to will a particular good, while\nyet leaving it up to the human being whether he or she wills that\ngood, Arnauld would surely say that we human beings cannot understand\nGod\u2019s causality well enough to supply such details. Our\ninability to understand God\u2019s causality with regard to the\ncreated world is a common theme in Arnauld. It is expressed forcefully\nin his first contribution to the Leibniz-Arnauld exchange, written in\n1686, not long after Libert\u00e9. Arnauld says that\nalthough we are certain that God, \u201cby a single and very simple\nact, which is His essence,\u201d knows all things, including things\nthat might not have been, and wills things that He might not have\nwilled by His will, which is also His essence, nevertheless we cannot\nunderstand how God does these things, because \u201cas far\nas we are concerned (\u00e0 notre \u00e9gard) God dwells\nin inaccessible light\u201d (LA, p.\n 31\u201332).[41]\n\nBefore presenting the above theory of free will in\nLibert\u00e9, Arnauld prepares the ground by presenting two\nexamples in which a person\u2019s volition occurs\n\u201cinfallibly\u201d and yet freely, in the sense of freedom\n\u201cthat is necessary and sufficient for merit or demerit\u201d\n(Libert\u00e9, OA, 10:620). The examples are\npreceded by the statement,\n\nHowever infallible be the determination by which the will is\ndetermined with the attention of reason, to objects to which it is not\nnaturally determined, freedom suffers no damage\n(pr\u00e9judice); because the infallible determination does\nnot prevent the soul from willing because it wills; and hence it is\nmaster of its action (Libert\u00e9, OA,\n10:615\u201316).\n\n\nThe first example is that of a prince who is in love with a woman and\nhas \u201ca vehement passion for the pleasures of the flesh.\u201d\nIf the woman offers herself to the prince, \u201che will infallibly\nsatisfy his passion.\u201d The second example is that of a cruel and\nrevengeful king, who has been offended by one of his subjects and has\nthe subject in his power: \u201cInfallibly he will destroy\n him.\u201d[42]\n Everyone who is not \u201centirely barbarian,\u201d says Arnauld,\nwill agree that the prince and the king have acted demeritoriously and\ndeserve punishment. Thus all such people agree that the king and the\nprince acted in a relevantly free way.\n\nOne might take these passages to suggest that the freedom necessary\nand sufficient for merit and demerit is compatible with determination\nof the will by psychological causes. But this misses Arnauld\u2019s\npoint, and is an unlikely interpretation. To begin with, Arnauld\nsurely realized that it was not impossible for the lascivious prince\nor the cruel king act otherwise than in the way described; people do\nsometimes act out of character. Furthermore, Arnauld seems to think of\ninfallibility, like its cousin, certainty, as a matter of degree. This\nis indicated by the phrase, \u201cHowever infallible be the\ndetermination by which the will is determined with the attention of\nreason \u2026\u201d The certainty that the cruel king and the\nlascivious prince would act in the ways indicated could have been very\nhigh and yet they could have acted otherwise.\n\nArnauld\u2019s point is not that the actions of the prince and the\nking are causally determined by psychological states antecedent to\ntheir volitions. In both cases he says that the action is free because\nthe person could have willed not to perform the action, or again,\nbecause the person\u2019s will was a potestas ad opposita.\nArnauld\u2019s point is that our certainty that the prince and the\nking will act in the ways described does not lessen our certainty that\nthey will act freely. The same, he says, is true of our certainty that\na meritorious act will be carried out as a result of efficacious\ngrace, that is, as a result of God\u2019s merciful will moving a\nperson to that act. Arnauld claims that our certainty about the\nfreedom of the act produced by efficacious grace, like our certainty\nabout the freedom of the actions of the prince and the king, is well\ngrounded because in all of these cases, the person had the power to\nrefrain from the act in question; in all of these cases, the\nperson\u2019s will is a facultas ad\n opposita.[43]\n\nThere is, of course, an important difference between examples like\nthose of the prince and the king, and example of an action to which\none is moved by efficacious grace. In examples of the former sort, the\naction occurs only with very great, but not absolute, certainty,\nwhereas in the case of efficacious grace, the action follows with\nabsolute certainty upon God\u2019s intention that it take place. This\ndifference may seem to damage Arnauld\u2019s case: One can plausibly\nsay that it was within the power of the prince, for example, not to\nwill to satisfy his lust, precisely because it was not absolutely\ncertain that, in the given circumstances, he would do so. But no\nsimilar claim can be made about the person whom God moves, by\nefficacious grace, to elicit a meritorious volition. Yet Arnauld\ninsists that in the latter case also, it is within the power of the\nperson not to elicit the volition. It is at this point that\nArnauld\u2019s views about the mysteriousness of divine causality\ncome into play. Our inability to understand how God moves a person to\na meritorious volition, while leaving it within the person\u2019s\npower not to elicit the volition, thus moving the person to will in a\nself-determining way, is not, in Arnauld\u2019s view, surprising, for\nwe are unable, in general, to understand how God produces effects\noutside of Himself.\n\nArnauld\u2019s work between 1682 and 1694 is a testament to his\nintellectual vitality. It is remarkable that he was hard at work,\nuntil his death at the age of 82, on a set of connected controversies\nand issues, both philosophical and theological, having to do with\ncreation, grace, and free will. Though he did not construct a\nphilosophical system, he stands out in a century of geniuses for the\nvigorous and penetrating way in which he dealt with many of the\nimportant philosophers and philosophical problems of the time.",
