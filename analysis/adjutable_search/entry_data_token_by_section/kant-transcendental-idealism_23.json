Things in themselves, noumena, and the transcendental object\n\nUp to this point, we have focused primarily on the nature of Kantian\nappearances, and their relation to things in themselves, questions (a)\nand (c) from section one. However, one of the main questions that must\nbe answered in any interpretation of Kant\u2019s transcendental\nidealism is, what are things in themselves? Obviously, different\ninterpretations will give very different answers to this question:\n\nPhenomenalist interpretations. Perhaps the best statement of\nthe phenomenalist interpretation of things in themselves is given by\nErich Adickes (1924: 14\u201319): things in themselves are a\nplurality of mind-independent centers of force. On this view, things\nin themselves are just what we pre-theoretically took ordinary\nspatiotemporal objects to be: objects that exist, and possess their\ncore physical properties, wholly independently of our representations\nof them, and which are (among) the causal inputs to our perceptual\nfaculties (a variant of this thought is expressed by Ameriks 2003:\n23\u201325).\n\nEpistemic interpretations: On the epistemic reading, things\nin themselves are simply objects considered independently of our\ndistinctively spatiotemporal form of intuition. Thus, they are objects\nconsidered as objects of a discursive cognition in general. This very\nabstract thought is not the basis of any cognition, however; it is\nmerely a reminder that space and time are epistemic conditions,\nwithout which we cannot cognize any object.\n\nMetaphysical \u201cdual aspect\u201d interpretations. On\nthis family of interpretations, things in themselves are objects with\na given set of properties. Different interpretations give a different\nanswer as to which set of properties constitute things \u201cas they\nare in themselves\u201d. On Langton\u2019s reading, for instance,\nthings in themselves are substances with intrinsic properties.\n\nIn this section we distinguish \u201cthings in themselves\u201d from\nother, closely related Kantian notions: noumena, and the\n\u201ctranscendental object\u201d.\n",
