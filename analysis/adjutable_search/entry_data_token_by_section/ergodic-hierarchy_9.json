    "main_text": "The Ergodic Hierarchy and Chaos\n8. Conclusion\n\nEH is often regarded as relevant for explicating the nature of\nrandomness in deterministic dynamical systems. It is not clear,\nhowever, what notion of randomness this claim invokes. The formal\ndefinitions of EH do not make explicit appeal to randomness and the\nusual ways of presenting EH do not involve any specification of the\nnotion of randomness that is supposed to underlie EH. As suggested in\nSection 5, EH can be interpreted as a hierarchy of randomness if\ndegrees of randomness are explicated in terms of degrees of\nunpredictability, which in turn are explicated in terms of (coherent)\nconditional degrees of beliefs. In order for these degrees of belief\nto be indicative of the system\u2019s dynamical properties, they have\nto be updated according to a system\u2019s dynamical law. The idea is\nthen that the different levels of EH, except for merely ergodic\nsystems, correspond to different kinds of unpredictability, which\ncorrespond to different patterns of decay of correlations between\nsystems\u2019 past states and their present states. Merely ergodic\nsystems seem to display no randomness, as the correlations between\ntheir past and present states need not decay at all.\n\nErgodic theory plays an important role in statistical physics, and EH,\nor some modification of it, constitutes an important measure of\nrandomness in both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems. It is\nsometimes argued that EH is by and large irrelevant for physics\nbecause real physical systems are not ergodic. But, this charge is\nunwarranted, and a closer look at non-ergodic systems reveals a rather\ndifferent picture, because EH can be fruitfully be used in the\nfoundations of statistical mechanics, analyses of randomness, and\nchaos theory. More recently it has also played a role in understanding\nlaws of nature (Filomeno 2019, List and Pivato 2019).\n",
