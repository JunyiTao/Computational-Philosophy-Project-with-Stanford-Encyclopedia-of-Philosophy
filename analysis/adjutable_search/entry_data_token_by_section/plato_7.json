    "main_text": "Links between the dialogues\n8. Links between the dialogues\n\nThere is a further reason for entertaining hypotheses about what Plato\nintended and believed, and not merely confining ourselves to\nobservations about what sorts of people his characters are and what\nthey say to each other. When we undertake a serious study of Plato,\nand go beyond reading just one of his works, we are inevitably\nconfronted with the question of how we are to link the work we are\ncurrently reading with the many others that Plato composed.\nAdmittedly, many of his dialogues make a fresh start in their setting\nand their interlocutors: typically, Socrates encounters a group of\npeople many of whom do not appear in any other work of Plato, and so,\nas an author, he needs to give his readers some indication of their\ncharacter and social circumstances. But often Plato\u2019s characters\nmake statements that would be difficult for readers to understand\nunless they had already read one or more of his other works. For\nexample, in Phaedo (73a-b), Socrates says that one argument\nfor the immortality of the soul derives from the fact that when people\nare asked certain kinds of questions, and are aided with diagrams,\nthey answer in a way that shows that they are not learning afresh from\nthe diagrams or from information provided in the questions, but are\ndrawing their knowledge of the answers from within themselves. That\nremark would be of little worth for an audience that had not already\nread Meno. Several pages later, Socrates tells his\ninterlocutors that his argument about our prior knowledge of equality\nitself (the form of equality) applies no less to other forms\u2014to\nthe beautiful, good, just, pious and to all the other things that are\ninvolved in their asking and answering of questions (75d). This\nreference to asking and answering questions would not be well\nunderstood by a reader who had not yet encountered a series of\ndialogues in which Socrates asks his interlocutors questions of the\nform, \u201cWhat is X?\u201d (Euthyphro: what is piety?\nLaches: what is courage? Charmides: What is\nmoderation? Hippias Major: what is beauty? see Dancy 2004).\nEvidently, Plato is assuming that readers of Phaedo have\nalready read several of his other works, and will bring to bear on the\ncurrent argument all of the lessons that they have learned from them.\nIn some of his writings, Plato\u2019s characters refer ahead to the\ncontinuation of their conversations on another day, or refer back to\nconversations they had recently: thus Plato signals to us that we\nshould read Theaetetus, Sophist, and\nStatesman sequentially; and similarly, since the opening of\nTimaeus refers us back to Republic, Plato is\nindicating to his readers that they must seek some connection between\nthese two works.\n\nThese features of the dialogues show Plato\u2019s awareness that he\ncannot entirely start from scratch in every work that he writes. He\nwill introduce new ideas and raise fresh difficulties, but he will\nalso expect his readers to have already familiarized themselves with\nthe conversations held by the interlocutors of other\ndialogues\u2014even when there is some alteration among those\ninterlocutors. (Meno does not re-appear in Phaedo; Timaeus\nwas not among the interlocutors of Republic.) Why does Plato\nhave his dominant characters (Socrates, the Eleatic visitor) reaffirm\nsome of the same points from one dialogue to another, and build on\nideas that were made in earlier works? If the dialogues were merely\nmeant as provocations to thought\u2014mere exercises for the\nmind\u2014there would be no need for Plato to identify his leading\ncharacters with a consistent and ever-developing doctrine. For\nexample, Socrates continues to maintain, over a large number of\ndialogues, that there are such things as forms\u2014and there is no\nbetter explanation for this continuity than to suppose that Plato is\nrecommending that doctrine to his readers. Furthermore, when Socrates\nis replaced as the principal investigator by the visitor from Elea (in\nSophist and Statesman), the existence of forms\ncontinues to be taken for granted, and the visitor criticizes any\nconception of reality that excludes such incorporeal objects as souls\nand forms. The Eleatic visitor, in other words, upholds a metaphysics\nthat is, in many respects, like the one that Socrates is made to\ndefend. Again, the best explanation for this continuity is that Plato\nis using both characters\u2014Socrates and the Eleatic\nvisitor\u2014as devices for the presentation and defense of a\ndoctrine that he embraces and wants his readers to embrace as\nwell.\n",
