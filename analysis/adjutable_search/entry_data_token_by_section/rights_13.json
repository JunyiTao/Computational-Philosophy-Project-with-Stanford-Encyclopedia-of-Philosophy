    "main_text": "Three Approaches to the Justification of Rights || Instrumental Rights\n6.2 Instrumental Rights\n\nInstrumental theories see rights as instruments for achieving an\noptimal distribution of advantages. The archetypal instrumental theory\nis some form of two-level consequentialism, such as rule\nutilitarianism. Within such a theory, rights are rules the general\nobservance of which will lead to an optimal distribution of\nadvantages. In rule utilitarianism, the optimal distribution is the\none that contains the greatest aggregate utility.\n\nThe most common objection to grounding rights in such a theory is that\nthe resulting rights will be too flimsy. If rights are justified only\ninsofar as they generate good consequences, it may seem that the\ntheory will need to prune its rights, perhaps severely, whenever\nmaximum utility lies elsewhere. Why is it not a rule in a two-level\nsystem, for example, that one should frame an innocent man if this\nwould prevent a major riot? Why should it not be a rule that one\nshould \u201cviolate\u201d the right of an innocent not to be killed\nif this would prevent the killings of two innocents elsewhere? While\nstatus-based rights can appear to be too strong, instrumental rights\ncan appear to be too weak. (See Pettit 1988 for a\ncounter-argument.)\n\nWeak rights are a problem for utilitarianism because its focus on\nmaximization makes it indifferent to certain facts about how utility\nis distributed across individuals. However, utilitarianism is not the\nonly kind of instrumental theory. \n\nFor example, a pure egalitarian theory will portray rights as\ninstruments for achieving a more equal distribution of advantages. A\nprioritarian theory will define an optimal distribution in a manner\nsimilar to egalitarianism, except that it will give extra weight to\nthe interests of those worse off. Other instrumental theories\ncharacterize \u201coptimal distribution\u201d in other ways (Sumner\n1987, 171). Instrumental theories that do not define an optimal\ndistribution in terms of maximization may face less pressure than\nutilitarianism does from concerns about weak rights (Scanlon\n1977).\n\nInstrumental theories differ over how they define what counts as an\noptimal distribution (maximization, equality, etc.). They also differ\nin how they measure individual advantage. For instance, a\nutilitarian\u2019s metric is utility, Sen works with a metric of\ncapabilities, Dworkin with resources, and so on.\n\nWhatever metric they use, all instrumental theorists will have to\naddress longstanding questions about the commensurability and\ninterpersonal comparison of interests. Since instrumental theorists\nwork with overall evaluations of how well off individuals would be\nwere certain rights ascribed, they must explain how distinct\ncategories of interests (e.g., health, income, opportunities for\nself-expression, social recognition) trade off against one another.\nThey must also explain why they believe that these interests are\nsimilar enough across persons that it makes sense to use the same\nscales of measurement for different persons (Griffin 1989).\n\nStatus theories are subject to the objection that they lack the\nconceptual resources to explain why the rights we believe in are\nintricately \u201cshaped\u201d to accommodate the particularities of\ndifferent contexts and different rightholders. Instrumental theories\nare vulnerable to the mirror-image objection. An instrumental theorist\ncan appeal to any number of distinct interests, which are at stake for\nany number of differently-situated individuals, to explain why a\ncertain right should be held only by certain persons or only in\ncertain circumstances. The danger for such a theorist is that the\nwealth of normative resources at her command will permit the\nascription of whatever rights she favors. The theorist begins with the\nrights that she wants to justify, then gives a \u201cjust so\u201d\nstory in terms of an optimal distribution of interests that leads to\nexactly those rights (Tushnet 1984, Frey 1985). Moreover all\ninstrumental justifications rely on empirical predictions concerning\nwhich ascriptions of rights would produce which consequences, and\nthere will typically be enough slack in these empirical predictions\nfor instrumental theorists to fudge their derivations in order to\nreach the desired rights.\n\nBoth status theories and instrumental theories of rights have held a\nperennial attraction. Because of this, many have been tempted to\nsearch for a hybrid approach that would combine what is plausible in\neach (e.g., Sen, 1982).\n",
