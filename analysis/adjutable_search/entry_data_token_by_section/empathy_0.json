Historical Introduction\n\nBefore the psychologist Edward Titchener (1867\u20131927) introduced\nthe term \u201cempathy\u201d in 1909 into the English language as\nthe translation of the German term \u201cEinf\u00fchlung\u201d (or\n\u201cfeeling into\u201d), \u201csympathy\u201dwas the term\ncommonly used to refer to empathy-related phenomena. If one were to\npoint to a conceptual core for understanding these phenomena, it is\nprobably best to point to David Hume\u2019s dictum that \u201cthe\nminds of men are mirrors to one another,\u201d(Hume 1739\u201340\n[1978], 365) since in encountering other persons, humans can resonate\nwith and recreate that person\u2019s thoughts and emotions on\ndifferent dimensions of cognitive complexity. While, as we will see,\nnot everybody shares such resonance conception of empathy(some\nphilosophers in the phenomenological tradition emphatically reject\nit), it certainly constitutes the center of Theodor Lipps\u2019s\nunderstanding, who Titchener had in mind in his translation of\n\u201cEinf\u00fchlung\u201d as \u201cempathy.\u201d \n\nTheodor Lipps (1851\u20131914)was also very familiar with the work of\nDavid Hume (see the introduction to Coplan and Goldie 2011 in this\nrespect). More importantly, it was Theodor Lipps, whose work\ntransformed empathy/Einf\u00fchlung from a concept of nineteenth\ncentury German aesthetics into a central category of the philosophy of\nthe social and human sciences. To understand this transformation we\nfirst need to appreciate the reasons why philosophers of the\nnineteenth century thought it necessary to appeal to empathy in order\nto account for our ability to appreciate natural objects and artefacts\nin an aesthetic manner. According to the dominant (even though not\nuniversally accepted) positivistic and empiricist conception, sense\ndata constitute the fundamental basis for our investigation of the\nworld. Yet from a phenomenological perspective, our perceptual\nencounter with aesthetic objects and our appreciation of them as being\nbeautiful\u2014our admiration of a beautiful sunset, for\nexample\u2014seems to be as direct as our perception of an object as\nbeing red or square. By appealing to the psychological mechanisms of\nempathy, philosophers intended to provide an explanatory account of\nthe phenomenological immediacy of our aesthetic appreciation of\nobjects. More specifically, for Lipps, our empathic encounter with\nexternal objects trigger inner \u201cprocesses\u201d that give rise\nto experiences similar to ones that I have when I engage in various\nactivities involving the movement of my body. Since my attention is\nperceptually focused on the external object, I experience\nthem\u2014or I automatically project my experiences\u2014as being in\nthe object. If those experiences are in some way apprehended in a\npositive manner and as being in some sense life-affirming, I perceive\nthe object as beautiful, otherwise as ugly. In the first case, Lipps\nspeaks of positive; in the later of negative empathy. Lipps also\ncharacterizes our experience of beauty as \u201cobjectified\nself-enjoyment,\u201d since we are impressed by the\n\u201cvitality\u201d and \u201clife potentiality\u201d that lies\nin the perceived object (Lipps 1906, 1903 a,b. For the contemporary\ndiscussion of empathy\u2019s role in aesthetics see particularly\nBreithaupt 2009; Coplan and Goldie 2011 (Part II); Curtis & Koch\n2009; and Keen 2007. For a recent history of the empathy concept see\nalso Lanzoni 2018).\n\nIn his Aesthetik, Lipps closely links our aesthetic\nperception and our perception of another embodied person as a minded\ncreature. The nature of aesthetic empathy is always the\n\u201cexperience of another human\u201d (1905, 49).\nWe appreciate another object as beautiful because empathy allows us to\nsee it in analogy to another human body. Similarly, we recognize\nanother organism as a minded creature because of empathy. Empathy in\nthis context is more specifically understood as a phenomenon of\n\u201cinner imitation,\u201d where my mind mirrors the mental\nactivities or experiences of another person based on the observation\nof his bodily activities or facial expressions. Empathy is ultimately\nbased on an innate disposition for motor mimicry, a fact that is well\nestablished in the psychological literature and was already noticed by\nAdam Smith (1853). Even though such a disposition is not always\nexternally manifested, Lipps suggests that it is always present as an\ninner tendency giving rise to similar kinaesthetic sensations in the\nobserver as felt by the observed target. In seeing the angry face of\nanother person we instinctually have a tendency of imitating it and of\n\u201cimitating\u201d her anger in this manner. Since we are not\naware of such tendencies, we see the anger in her face (Lipps 1907).\nDespite the fact that Lipps\u2019s primary examples of empathy focus\non the recognition of emotions expressed in bodily gestures or facial\nexpressions, his conception of empathy should not be understood as\nbeing limited to such cases. As his remarks about intellectual empathy\nsuggest (1903b/05), he regards our recognition of all mental\nactivities\u2014insofar as they are activities requiring human\neffort\u2014as being based on empathy or on inner imitation (See also\nthe introductory chapter in Stueber 2006).\n",
