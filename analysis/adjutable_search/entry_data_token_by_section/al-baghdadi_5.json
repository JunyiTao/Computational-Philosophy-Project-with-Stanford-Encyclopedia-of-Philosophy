In the first place this writer does not possess a specific\ntechnical knowledge of the various sciences which he has decided to\nconsider: his use of the medical terminology is inaccurate, for\nexample, in his notes on Avicenna\u2019s Canon. In the\nsecond place, since he lacks any didactic method, he simply raises\ncontinual sophisms. For these reasons, \u2018Abd al-Latif maintains\nthat he should not even try to take on the holy text of the\nKoran as he did in his commentary on sura 112 or on sura 95\nand sura 87 (Gannag\u00e9 2011: 227\u2013256; Stern 1962:\n57\u201359).\n",
