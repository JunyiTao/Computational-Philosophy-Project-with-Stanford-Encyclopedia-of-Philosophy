    "main_text": "Outstanding Issues\n3. Outstanding Issues\n\nDespite the attractions discussed above, FA theories also face several\noutstanding issues, which challenge both their extensional adequacy\nand explanatory commitments. This section covers four outstanding\nissues for FA theory. The first three consist in putative\ncounterexamples that\u00a0pose extensional challenges: the Wrong Kind\nof Reason problem (section 3.1); the Wrong Kind of Value problem\n(section 3.2); and the problem of partiality (section 3.3). The fourth\nand final issue challenges the explanatory element of FA theory,\nalleging that at least certain FA theories may be viciously circular\n(section 3.4).\n",
