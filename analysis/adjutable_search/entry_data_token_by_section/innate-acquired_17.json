    "main_text": "Revisionist and Eliminativist Proposals || Eliminativism about the innate/acquired distinction\n3.5 Eliminativism about the innate/acquired distinction\n\nThe previous subsections described attempts to revise the scientific\nconcept of innateness in order to avoid the semantic confusion that\nhas obscured the real issues in nearly a century and a half of\ncontroversy about the innate/acquired distinction. To briefly recap,\nthere are three general problems that critics associate with this\nconcept. One problem is that the concept is deeply muddled. Mameli and\nBateson (2006) identified as many as 26 distinct\n\u2018i-properties\u2019 associated with innateness. This alone is a\nsource of confusion, potentially leading scientists to misunderstand\none another, especially when it comes to communication across\ndifferent disciplines. A related worry is that researchers will be\ninclined to draw fallacious inferences, where evidence for the\npresence of one i-property is taken as sufficient grounds for\ninferring the existence of other i-properties. The fact that\npsychologists since C.L. Morgan (1896) have warned against this\ntendency (see also Dunlap 1919; Bernard 1924; Lehrman 1953; Bateson\n1991) indicates that it is a genuine concern among practitioners, and\nnot merely hypothetical (see Section 2). A second recurring complaint\nis that innateness claims draw scientific attention away from the\nmultifarious and often subtle ways in which environmental factors\ncontribute to development. Again, this objection has a long history\nthat extends back to A.R. Wallace (1892) and has been raised on\nnumerous occasions by psychologists (e.g. Kuo 1921; Lehrman 1970),\nbiologists (e.g. Hinde 1968; Bateson 1991) and philosophers (e.g.\nCowie 1998; Griffiths 2002). A third objection is that the scientific\nconcept of innateness is psychologically anchored in an essentialist\nfolk biology that is scientifically untenable.\n\nInstead of asking scientists to agree to use a revised conception of\ninnateness, which would then have to be consistently distinguished\nfrom the vernacular conception, a simpler and potentially more\neffective strategy is to eliminate the innate/acquired distinction\nfrom scientific discourse. This recommendation has been advocated by a\nnumber of philosophers and some scientists (Mameli and Bateson 2006;\nBateson and Mameli 2007; Griffiths 2002; Griffiths, et al. 2009;\nGriffiths and Machery 2008; Linquist et al. 2011; Linquist 2018;\nMachery 2017; Machery et al. 2019). This does not mean forbidding the\nuse of the word \u2018innate\u2019, even if such a thing were\npossible or ethical. It merely means reducing its status to that of\nphrases like \u2018in the blood\u2019 which are no longer seen as\nthe names of serious scientific constructs worthy of detailed\ninvestigation.\n\nCowie (2009) offers a helpful distinction between three types of\neliminativist argument. The first, argues that some type of object or\nproperty fails to exist. She claims that this type of argument cannot\nbe applied to the concept of innateness because the concept is too\nunclear to even specify what it refers to. A second style of argument\nclaims that a concept should be eliminated because \u201cit\ndoesn\u2019t work.\u201d That is, because it is associated with a\nfailing or degenerate research program. Cowie argues that the concept\nof innateness has in fact been highly productive. This is a question\nwe return to momentarily. The third style of argument claims that the\ntarget concept is so muddled that it should be eliminated for this\nreason alone. Cowie (2009) suggests that vagueness and ambiguity can\npotentially lead to fruitful research programs. Philosophers should be\ncautious about demanding conceptual clarity from scientists when\nunclear concepts are leading to productive outcomes.\n\nIn support of the suggestion that the concept of innateness has been\nscientifically productive, Cowie relies on examples from cognitive\nscience such as that of Chomsky and his followers on language\nacquisition. Although one cannot deny that this concept has been\nproductive, it is a further question whether certain sciences would\nhave advanced more rapidly if they had not framed their hypotheses in\nterms of the innate/acquired distinction. Another lesson to be drawn\nfrom the history of psychology is that the sheer volume of research\npapers on a subject is not always a good indication of a healthy\ndiscipline. The study of instinct was a productive cottage industry at\nthe beginning of the 20th century (see Section 1.2). Little of this\nwork is cited today, except as an historical example of a failed\nresearch program. More recently, the discipline of Evolutionary\nPsychology has revived a similar approach to nativism as the early\ninstinct theorists (Hampton 2004). It is controversial whether this\nprogram qualifies as an advance in our understanding of the human mind\n(Buller 2006; Laland and Brown 2002). Ultimately, it is an empirical\nquestion whether adherence to an innate/acquired distinction is\nconducive to scientific progress. It is notoriously difficult to say\nwhether a given research program is on the whole more or less\nproductive than some rival (Laudan 1977). Yet this is an area where,\nwe think, careful historical and philosophical analysis would pay\nvaluable dividends.\n",
