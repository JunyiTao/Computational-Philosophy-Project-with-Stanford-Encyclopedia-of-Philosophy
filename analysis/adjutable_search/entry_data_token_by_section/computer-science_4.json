    "main_text": "Intention and Specification || Intentions\n2.1 Intentions\n\nIntentions articulate\u00a0the criteria to determine whether a\ncomputational\u00a0system is appropriate (i.e., correct, see\n \u00a77),\n and therefore it is considered as the first LoA of the computational\nsystem appropriate to that problem. For instance, customers and users\nmay require a smartphone app able to filter out annoying calls from\ncall centers; such request constitutes the intention LoA in the\ndevelopment of a computational system able to perform such a task. In\nthe software development process of non-naive systems, intentions are\nusually gathered by such techniques as brainstorming, surveys,\nprototyping, and even focus groups (Clarke and Moreira 1999), aimed at\ndefining a structured set of the various stakeholders\u2019\nintentions. At this LoA, no reference is made to how to solve\nthe computational problem, but only the description of the problem\nthat must be solved is provided.\n\nIn contemporary literature, intentions have been the object of\nphilosophical inquiry at least since Anscombe (1963). Philosophers\nhave investigated \u201cintentions with which\u201d an action is\nperformed (Davidson 1963), intentions of doing something in the future\n(Davidson 1978), and intentional actions (Anscombe 1963, Baier 1970,\nFerrero 2017). Issues arise concerning which of the three kinds of\nintention is primary, how they are connected, the relation between\nintentions and belief, whether intentions are or presuppose specific\nmental states, and whether intentions act as causes of actions (see\nthe entry on\n intention).\n More formal problems concern the opportunity for an agent of having\ninconsistent intentions and yet being considered rational (Bratman\n1987, Duijf et al. 2019).\n\nIn their role as the first LoA in the ontology of computational\nsystems, intentions can certainly be acknowledged as intentions for\nthe future, in that they express the objective of constructing systems\nable to perform some desired computational tasks. Since intentions, as\nstated above, confine themselves to the definition of the\ncomputational problem to be solved, without specifying its\ncomputational solution, their ontological and epistemological analysis\ndoes not differ from those referred to in the philosophical\nliterature. In other words, there is nothing specifically\ncomputational in the intentions defining computational systems which\ndeserves a separate treatment in the philosophy of computer science.\nWhat matters here is the relation between intention and specification,\nin that intentions provide correctness criteria for specifications;\nspecifications are asked to express how the computational problem put\nforward by intentions is to be solved.\n",
