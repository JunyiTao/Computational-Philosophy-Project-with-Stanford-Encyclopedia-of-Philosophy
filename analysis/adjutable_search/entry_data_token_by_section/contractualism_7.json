    "main_text": "Is contractualism circular or redundant?\n6. Is contractualism circular or redundant?\n\nThe remainder of this entry examines problem cases for contractualism.\nThe first two concern the logical structure of\ncontractualism\u2014asking whether its account of wrongness is either\ncircular or incomplete. The next four are puzzle cases where the most\nobvious interpretation of contractualism seems to yield implausible\nresults. The last two are groups who should be included in the scope\nof morality, but who seem to be left out by contractualism: animals\nand future people.\n\nAs we saw in section 3.2, contractualism allows for the reasonable\nrejection of principles on grounds other than their direct impact on\nthe individual\u2019s well-being. However, this appeal to reasons\nbeyond well-being brings out a common objection to\ncontractualism\u2014that the whole apparatus of reasonable rejection\nis redundant. The objection is as follows. Contractualism says\nx is wrong if and only if x is forbidden by\nprinciples no-one can reasonably reject. Anyone can reasonably reject\na principle on the grounds that it permits actions that are wrong. So\na principle that no-one can reasonably reject is a principle that\npermits no actions that are wrong. If we don\u2019t already know\nwhich actions are wrong, then we cannot use the contractualist\napparatus. But if we do already know which actions are wrong, then we\ndon\u2019t need to use it.\n\nThere is a related objection using \u2018unfair\u2019 instead of\n\u2018wrong\u2019. Suppose, following our previous discussion in\n section 3,\n we agree that contractualism allows \u2018because it treats me\nunfairly\u2019 to count as a reason for rejecting a principle. We\nthen face the challenge that our judgments of unfairness are doing all\nthe real moral work, as contractualism now says that a principle is\nwrong if and only if it treats someone unfairly.\n\nTo respond to this objection, contractualists must explain why\n\u2018x is wrong\u2019 and \u2018x is\nunfair\u2019 are not the sort of claims that can feature as a reason\nfor rejecting a principle. They must also demonstrate that admitting\nreasons not based directly on well-being does not commit us to\nadmitting \u2018x is wrong\u2019 and \u2018x is\nunfair\u2019.\n\nThe Contractualist answer appeals to the conceptual link between\nwrongness and justification. Whether an act is wrong depends, not only\non its direct impact on individuals, but also on whether a principle\npermitting it can be justified to all concerned. \u2018Because it is\nwrong\u2019 is not the kind of reason that can be fed into the\ncontractualist apparatus, since it is not something that happens to\nindividuals. Instead, wrongness is something that is constructed out\nof individuals\u2019 reasons using that very apparatus. The same goes\nfor \u2018because it is unfair\u2019. In the example of the racist\nprinciple introduced in section 3.2, I reject the principle, not\nbecause it treats me unfairly overall, but because it illicitly places\nweight on an inappropriate moral distinction. My complaint\nconcerns how a principle treats me. To know whether an action\nis wrong, we must compare different people\u2019s complaints, which\nwe do by comparing one principle\u2019s treatment of me with the way\nalternative principles treat others.\n",
