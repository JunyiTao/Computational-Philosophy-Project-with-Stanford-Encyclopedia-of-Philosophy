    "main_text": "Theories of Attention || Precision Optimization Theories and Prediction Error Coding\n2.5 Precision Optimization Theories and Prediction Error Coding\n\nThe idea that there might be reasons for attentional selection that\nhave nothing to do with processing bottlenecks has also been a theme\nin the work of psychologists hoping to understand perception as a\nprocess of Bayesian inference (Friston et al. 2006,\nSummerfield & Egner, 2013), and in the work of those philosophers\nwho have been influenced by them (Hohwy, 2013; Clark, 2013, 2017).\n\nIn what has come to be the most philosophically developed version of\nthis Bayesian approach to the mind (Hohwy, 2013, Clark, 2013),\ncognition as a whole is understood to be a process of Bayesian\nupdating, in which a hierarchically-organized series of hypotheses is\nconstantly being tested, with each hypothesis being updated in the\nlight of evidence coming from the level below. Advocates of this\ntheory attempt to find room within this hierarchical framework for all\naspects of cognition, including perception, thought, and action. A\ncentral claim of their theory is that the information that gets passed\nup through this hierarchy is encoded in the form of signals\nrepresenting the errors in the predictions that have been\nmade by hypotheses at the hierarchy\u2019s next level up, with the\ncontent of one\u2019s experience at any time being given by whichever\nhypothesis makes the least erroneous predictions. (Different versions\nof the theory use different techniques to calculate the relative size\nof these prediction errors.) Given their commitment to\nprediction-error coding, a central claim of these theories is that the\nrole of our sensory encounter with the world is to provide information\nabout the way in which our prior hypotheses get things wrong: instead\nof providing us with the information that it has started to rain, our\nsenses provide only the information that it is more rainy than we had\nexpected.\n\nAdvocates of this theory claim that it \u201callows us to see\nattention in a new light and to provide alternative conceptualizations\nof its functional role in our overall mental economy\u201d (Hohwy,\n2014, p. 191). According to these \u2018alternative\nconceptions\u2019, attention adjusts the weighting of incoming\nprediction error signals, in accordance with their expected\nprecision (Hohwy, 2012). \u2018Precision\u2019 is to be\nunderstood here in the sense that contrasts precision with accuracy.\n\u2018Accuracy\u2019, in the intended sense, is a measure of the\ndifference between the value indicated by a signal and the actual\nvalue, whereas \u2018precision\u2019 is a measure of the random\nfluctuation in that signal, even when the actual input is held\nconstant. A miscalibrated instrument might, in this sense, be highly\nprecise, without being especially accurate.\n\nVarious empirical results make it plausible that the brain takes\naccount of expected precisions when it is processing perceptual\nsignals. In the ventriloquist illusion, for example, it is plausible\nthat expectations of precision have a role to play: It is because\nvision is expected to give a more precise indication of location than\naudition that sounds are heard to come from the location where their\nsource is apparently seen. Other considerations make it equally\nplausible that attention plays a role in accommodating the variations\nin these expected precisions, as we move from one context to another.\nIf we expect that the signal from vision is likely to be a noisy\none\u2014perhaps because a thick fog has started to\ndescend\u2014then we may place more weight than usual on the\ninformation that is present in the signal coming from audition. It\nseems likely that there is a role for attention in bringing about this\nchange of weighting. It is more controversial to claim, as the\nadvocates of this theory do, that \u201cattention is nothing but\nprecision optimization in hierarchical inference.\u201d (Hohwy, 1014,\np.244, citing Feldman & Friston, 2010). Ransom et al.\nhave suggested that, by taking attention always to be\nprecision optimization, this theory struggles to account for certain\nforms of voluntary attention (Ransom et al. 2017). Clark has\nsuggested that this challenge can be met if the sources of voluntary\nattention are identified with beliefs, rather than desires (Clark,\n2017).\n",
