    "main_text": "Types, Degrees, and Relatives of Belief || Belief and Delusion\n2.6 Belief and Delusion\n\nThe standard reference text in psychiatry, the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V-TR, 2022)\ncharacterizes delusions (e.g., persecutory delusions, delusions of\ngrandiosity) as beliefs. However, delusions often do not appear to\nconnect with behavior in the usual way. For example, a victim of\nCapgras delusion\u2014a delusion in which the subject asserts that a\nfamily member or close friend has been replaced by an\nidentical-looking imposter\u2014may continue to live with the\n\u201cimposter\u201d and make little effort to find the supposedly\nmissing loved one. Some philosophers have therefore suggested that\ndelusions do not occupy quite the functional role characteristic of\nbelief and thus are not, in fact, beliefs (e.g., Currie 2000; Stephens\nand Graham 2004; Gallagher 2009; Matthews 2013). Others have defended\nthe view that delusions are beliefs (e.g., Campbell 2001; Bayne and\nPacherie 2005; Bortolotti 2010, 2012) or in-between cases, with some\nfeatures of belief but not other features (e.g., Egan 2009; Tumulty\n2011). See the entry on\n delusion,\n especially \u00a74.2\n Are Delusions Beliefs?\n\n",
