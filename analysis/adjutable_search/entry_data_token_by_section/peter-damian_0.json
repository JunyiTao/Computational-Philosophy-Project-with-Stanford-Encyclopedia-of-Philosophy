    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nPeter Damian (Petrus Damianus or Petrus Damiani) was born in or\naround 1007 in Ravenna, Italy. He acquired the name Damianus or Damiani\nafter his elder brother Damianus, who cared for him in his youth. Peter\nstudied liberal arts and law in Ravenna, Faenza and Parma, and gained a\nreputation as a teacher of rhetoric. About 1035, Damian experienced a\nreligious conversion and entered the monastery at Fonte Avellana, near\nGubbio. Because of his zealous devotion and his learning, Damian was\nsoon entrusted with administrative and teaching tasks in his own and\nother monasteries. He became prior of Fonte Avellana in 1043, and led\nthe monastery to a new prosperity. Damian developed into one of the\nmost influential persons in the Church of his time who, through his\nwritings and personal contacts, sought to foster monastic reform and\nreform of the Church. In 1057, Damian was nominated Cardinal-Bishop of\nOstia against his will; he was relieved of at least some of the duties\nrelated to the office a few years later. Because of Damian\u2019s rhetorical\nskills and his knowledge of Canon Law, the Pope used him as his legate\non several occasions. Damian died when returning from one such mission\non the 22nd or 23rd of February 1072 in Faenza.\n\n\nPeter Damian was a voluminous writer. The most important part of his\nproduction is his letters, which number 180. Damian\u2019s treatises are\nalso included in the collection of letters because they take the form\nof letters. The only one of Damian\u2019s works which is considered to be of\nphilosophical interest is Letter 119, which is better known as De\ndivina omnipotentia (On Divine Omnipotence). This letter\nis addressed to Abbot Didier of Monte Cassino and his community, and it\nis dated at the beginning of 1065.\n \n\nThe recent book-length studies on Damian\u2019s life and thought by\nMcCready (2011) and Ranft (2012) are not philosophical in orientation,\nbut they can be usefully read to gain an understanding of Damian's\ncareer and his personality.\n",
