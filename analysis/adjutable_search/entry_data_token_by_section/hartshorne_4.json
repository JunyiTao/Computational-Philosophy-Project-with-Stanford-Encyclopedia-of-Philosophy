    "main_text": "Axiology\n5. Critical Evaluation\n\nIt seems fair to say that analytic philosophers, in general, even\nanalytic philosophers who are theists, have largely ignored\nHartshorne\u2019s philosophy. (The point is debateable. There has\nbeen a move among many analytic philosophers who are theists, as in\nRichard Swinburne, away from the eternal, Boethian God who is outside\nof time altogether. Might it be that Hartshorne\u2019s influence is\ngreater than initially appears to be the case when the temporality, or\nthe sempiternity, of the God of many analytic philosophers is\nconcerned?) This is in contrast to his wide influence among\ntheologians, which is odd when it is considered that he is not a\ntheologian and does not rely on sacred scripture or religious\nauthority for his insights. Another oddity is the fact that\nHartshorne\u2019s influence among theologians is due to the defense\nhe offers of the rationality of belief in a neoclassical\nGod.\n\nThere is at least one important philosopher whose work indicates the\nsort of debate that has occurred between Hartshorne and analytic\ntheists, who tend to rely on traditional or classical versions of the\nconcept of God. That is William Alston. There are two reasons why an\nevaluation of Hartshorne\u2019s philosophy is facilitated by a\nconsideration of Alston\u2019s critique. First, Alston is as\nimportant a theist as any among analytic philosophers and his\ncriticisms of Hartshorne\u2019s thought are like those of other\nanalytic philosophers like Thomas Morris, Richard Creel, Michael\nDurrant, and others. And second, Alston is a former student of\nHartshorne\u2019s and is thoroughly familiar with Hartshorne\u2019s\narguments. Alston is a philosopher who is not scandalized by\nHartshorne\u2019s panentheism, nor by his neoclassical theism. But\nAlston thinks that the contrast that Hartshorne draws between his\nneoclassical theism and the classical theism of Thomas Aquinas is too\nsharp.\n\nAlston thinks that Hartshorne presents neoclassical theism and\nclassical theism as complete packages, whereas it would be better to\nbe able to pick and choose among individual items within these\npackages. Alston seeks some sort of rapprochement between Thomism and\nneoclassical theism, a rapprochement that Hartshorne himself would\nlike to bring about to the extent that he is a neoclassical\nthinker, but that is difficult to accomplish to the extent that he is\nneoclassical.\n\nA consideration of ten contrasting attributes will best facilitate an\ninitial understanding of Hartshorne\u2019s view of God. Consider the\nfirst group of attributes treated by Alston.\n\n\n\nCLASSICAL ATTRIBUTES\nNEOCLASSICAL ATTRIBUTES \n\n1. absoluteness (absence of internal relatedness)\n1. relativity (God is internally related to creatures by way of\nknowledge of them and actions toward them) \n\n2. pure actuality (there is no potentiality in God)\n2. potentiality (not everything is actualized that is possible\nfor God) \n\n3. total necessity (every truth about God is necessarily\ntrue)\n3. necessity and contingency (God exists necessarily, but\nvarious things are true of God contingently, e.g., God\u2019s\nknowledge of what is contingent) \n\n4. absolute simplicity\n4. complexity  \n\n\nAlston distinguishes two lines of argument regarding absoluteness and\nrelativity, which he sees as the key contrast. Alston thinks that only\none of these is successful. As indicated in the diagram above, what\nHartshorne means by absoluteness is absence of internal relatedness. A\nrelation is internal to a term of a relation just in case that term\nwould not be exactly as it is if it were not in that relationship.\nHartshorne\u2019s view is that God has internal relations to\ncreatures by way of knowing and acting towards them and receiving\ninfluence from them.\n\nOn Alston\u2019s interpretation, Hartshorne\u2019s first line of\nargument is to say that if the relation of the absolute to the world\nreally fell outside the absolute, then this relation would necessarily\nfall within some further and genuinely single entity that embraced\nboth the absolute and the world and the relations between them. Thus,\nwe must hold, according to Hartshorne, that the God-creature relation\nis internal to God; otherwise we will have to admit that there is\nsomething greater or more inclusive than God. Alston does not find\nthis argument convincing because it includes the claim that God\n\u201ccontains\u201d the world due to the internal relations God has\nwith the world. Alston\u2019s view is that the entity to which a\nrelation is internal contains the terms only in the minimal sense that\nthose terms enter into a description of the entity, but it does not\nfollow from this that those terms are contained in that entity in an\norganic way.\n\nDivine inclusiveness, for Hartshorne, is sometimes like the inclusion\nof thoughts in a mind, but usually it is described as like the\ninclusion of cells within a living body. It is never like the\ninclusion of marbles in a box. The inorganic and insentient character\nof a box is inadequate as a model for divinity, he thinks, and divine\ninclusiveness is never like the inclusion of theorems in a set of\naxioms, as it might be for certain idealists. Divine inclusiveness in\nHartshorne is organic inclusiveness.\n\nHartshorne\u2019s second argument against absoluteness fares much\nbetter, according to Alston. He agrees with Hartshorne\u2019s stance\nregarding the cognitive relation God has with the world; in any case\nof knowledge, the knowledge relation is internal to the subject,\nexternal to the object. When a human being knows something, the fact\nthat she knows it is part of what makes her the concrete being that\nshe is. If she recognizes a certain tree she is different from the\nbeing she might have been if she had not recognized the tree. But the\ntree is unaffected by her recognition. Likewise, according to Alston,\none cannot maintain that God has perfect knowledge of everything\nknowable and still hold that God is not qualified to any degree by\nrelations with other beings.\n\nOne might respond to Alston and Hartshorne on this point by saying\nthat since creatures depend for their existence on God, their\nrelations to God affect them, but not God. Richard Creel\nseems to make this very point. But even if beings other than God\ndepend for their existence on God, it still remains true that if God\nhad created a different world from the one that exists at present,\nthen God would be somewhat different from the way God is at present:\nGod\u2019s knowledge would have been of that world and not\nthis one, according to both Alston and Hartshorne.\n\nAlston\u2019s concessions to Hartshorne\u2019s concept of God extend\nto contrasts 2\u20134. The above argument for the internal\nrelatedness of God (as cognitive subject) to the world presupposes\nthat there are alternative possibilities for God, and if there are\nalternative possibilities for divine knowledge then this implies that\nthere are unrealized potentialities for God. Pure actuality\nand total necessity cannot be defended as divine attributes,\naccording to Alston and Hartshorne. Alston\u2019s version of\nHartshorne\u2019s argument goes as follows:\n\n(1) (a) \u201cGod knows that W exists\u201d entails (b) \u201cW\nexists.\u201d\n\n\n(2) If (a) were necessary, (b) would be necessary.\n\n(3) But (b) is contingent.\n\n(4) Hence (a) is contingent.\n\n\nWe can totally exclude contingency from God only by denying God any\nknowledge of anything contingent, a step that not even traditional or\nclassical theists wish to take. Contrast 4 must also be treated in a\ndipolar way in that the main support for a doctrine of pure divine\nsimplicity is the absence of any unrealized potentialities in God.\n\nIn sum, Alston and Hartshorne agree on contrasts 1\u20134, except for\nthe fact that Hartshorne\u2019s concept of divine inclusiveness, in\ncontrast to Alston\u2019s, is organic in character.\n\nRegarding a second group of attributes, however, Alston and many other\ntheists who are analytic philosophers diverge from Hartshorne rather\nsignificantly:\n\n\n\nCLASSICAL ATTRIBUTES\nNEOCLASSICAL ATTRIBUTES \n\n5. creation ex nihilo by a free act of will; God could\nhave refrained from creating anything\n5. both God and the world of creatures exist necessarily,\nalthough the details are contingent \n\n6. omnipotence (God has the power to do anything God wills to do\nthat is logically consistent)\n6. God has all the power one agent could have given\nmetaphysical, in addition to logical, limitations \n\n7. incorporeality\n7. corporeality (the world is the body of God) \n\n8. nontemporality (God does not live through a series of\nmoments)\n8. temporality (God lives through temporal succession, but\neverlastingly) \n\n9. immutability (God cannot change because God is not temporally\nsuccessive)\n9. mutability (God is continually attaining richer syntheses of\nexperience) \n\n10. absolute perfection (God is eternally that than which no\nmore perfect can be conceived)\n10. relative perfection (at any moment God is more perfect than\nany other, but God is self-surpassing at a later stage of\ndevelopment)  \n\n\nConcerning contrast 5, Alston takes creation ex nihilo to be\nfundamental to theism because it has deep roots in religious\nexperience. He thinks that to say that God has unrealized\npotentialities and contingent properties is not to say that God\nmust be in relation with some world of entities other than\nGod. Alston admits that Hartshorne legitimately points out some of the\ninternal contradictions contained in the classical theistic version of\ncreation ex nihilo, but he claims that there is no connection\ndrawn by Hartshorne between divine creation and metaphysical\nprinciples regarding relativity, contingency, and potentiality.\nAlston\u2019s belief seems to be that those who accept creation\nex nihilo are not saying that there is absolutely nothing at\nany stage: there is God. Rather, creation ex nihilo only\nmeans that there is nothing out of which God creates the universe.\nHere Alston seems to agree with Norman Kretzmann, Eleonore Stump, and\nmost other theists who are analytic philosophers.\n\nAlston\u2019s stance here is problematic for two reasons, from\nHartshorne\u2019s point of view. First, although belief in\nsome sort of divine creativity has deep roots in the history\nof religious experience, it is not clear that these roots have to tap\ninto creation ex nihilo. For example, it is not clear that\ncreation ex nihilo is the sort of creation described in\nGenesis, in that when the Bible starts with the statement that the\nspirit of God hovered above the waters, one gets the impression that\nboth God and the aqueous muck had been around forever. If one believes\nin creation ex nihilo, however, as Alston does, one might\nnonetheless claim that creation ex nihilo does not\nnecessarily mean a temporal beginning to the act of creation. But even\non this hypothesis there are problems, and this would seem to be\nHartshorne\u2019s second point. If Plato and Hartshorne are correct\nthat being is dynamic power, then the sort of unlimited power\nimplied by creation ex nihilo is impossible. Hartshorne would\nargue, contra Alston, that there is a connection between belief in\ncreation ex hyle (as opposed to creation ex nihilo)\nand the metaphysical principle that being is dynamic power. Creation\nex nihilo, Hartshorne thinks, is a convenient fiction\ninvented in the first centuries B.C.E. and C.E. in order to exalt\ndivine power, but it is not the only sort of creation that religious\nbelievers have defended, nor is it defensible if being is dynamic\npower.\n\nConcerning contrast 6, Alston claims that belief in creation ex\nnihilo and belief in divine omnipotence are separate beliefs such\nthat to argue against the former is not necessarily to argue against\nthe latter. Hartshorne tries to do too much, he thinks, with the claim\nthat being is power when he uses this claim to argue against divine\nomnipotence. According to Alston, God can have unlimited\npower, power to do anything that God wills to do, without having\nall power in that, if being is power, the creatures also have\nsome power.\n\nOn Hartshorne\u2019s interpretation of Alston, however, God can have\nideal\u00a0power, but not all power, because in addition to divine\npower there are the existences of others with powers of their own.\nAlthough God does not have all power, Hartshorne thinks that on\nAlston\u2019s view God could have all power. In effect, what\nAlston has done, according to Hartshorne, is reduce his stance\nregarding divine omnipotence to that regarding creation ex\nnihilo in that the claim that God could have all power is due to\nthe prior belief that God brings everything into existence out of\nabsolutely nothing, a belief that Alston thinks has to be the\ntraditional one and in point of fact is intelligible. It is not quite\nclear to Hartshorne, however, that it is unquestionably the\ntraditional one, nor is it clear to him that we can develop an\nintelligible concept of \u201cabsolutely nothing.\u201d\n\nHartshorne\u2019s Platonic or Bergsonian argument against creation\nex nihilo, in simplified form, looks something like this: one\ncan in fact imagine the nonexistence of this or that, or even of this\nor that class of things, a fact that gives some the confidence to\n(erroneously) think that this process can go on infinitely such that\none could imagine a state in which there was \u201cabsolutely\nnothing.\u201d However, not every verbally possible statement is made\nconceptually cogent by even the most generous notion of\n\u201cconceptual,\u201d according to Hartshorne. At the specific,\nordinary, empirical level negative instances are possible (e.g., this\ncorkscrew is not a dog), but at the generic, metaphysical level only\npositive instances are possible (e.g., something must exist), on this\nview. The sheer absence of reality cannot conceivably be experienced,\nhe thinks, for if it were experienced an existing experiencer would be\npresupposed.\n\nContrast 7 deals with divine embodiment. Alston is willing to grant\nthat God is embodied in two senses: (1) God is aware, with maximal\nimmediacy, of what goes on in the world; and (2) God can directly\naffect what happens in the world. That is, Alston defends a limited\nversion of divine embodiment, similar to that defended by Richard\nSwinburne. However, Alston is sceptical regarding a stronger version\nof divine embodiment wherein the world exists by metaphysical\nnecessity such that God must animate it. Alston is willing to\naccept the idea that God has a body, but only if having such\na body is on God\u2019s terms. It seems that this weaker version of\ndivine embodiment defended by Alston, as opposed to Hartshorne\u2019s\nstronger version wherein there is essential corporeality in God,\nstands or falls with the defense of creation ex nihilo. In\nfact, despite Alston\u2019s desire to examine each contrast\nindividually, as opposed to Hartshorne\u2019s stark contrast between\nclassical theistic attributes (all ten of them) and neoclassical\nattributes (all ten of them), he ends up linking his criticisms of\nHartshorne regarding contrasts 5\u20137, at the very least. All three\nof these classical theistic attributes stand together only with a\ndefensible version of creation ex nihilo.\n\nContrasts 8\u20139, concerning nontemporality and immutability, are\nalso linked by Alston. He concedes that if God is temporal, Hartshorne\nhas offered us the best version to date of what divine temporality and\ndivine mutability would be like. Alston dismisses as idle the view\nthat God could remain completely unchanged through a succession of\ntemporal moments, but this admission still leaves us, he thinks, with\nthe following conditional statement: \u201cGod undergoes change\nif God is in time.\u201d Alston\u2019s critique of\nHartshorne\u2019s view also consists in a refusal to grant that\ncontingency and temporality are coextensive in the way mutability and\ntemporality are. Alston believes, contra Hartshorne, that God can be\nin some way contingent (that any relation in which God stands to the\nworld might have been otherwise) and still be nontemporal.\n\nAlston knows that the notion of a nontemporal God who is nonetheless\nqualified by relation to temporal beings will strike Hartshorne as\nunintelligible. Alston\u2019s attempt to make his position\nintelligible rests on his own Thomistic-Whiteheadian stance, or\nbetter, on his Thomistic or Boethian interpretation of Whitehead\n(strange as this seems); Alston is also influenced here by Eleanore\nStump and Norman Kretzmann. We should not think of God as involved in\nprocess or becoming of any sort. The best temporal analogy, he thinks,\nfor this conception is an unextended instant or an \u201ceternal\nnow.\u201d For Alston this does not commit one, however, as\nHartshorne would allege, to a static deity frozen in immobility. On\nthe contrary, according to Alston, God is eternally active in ways\nthat do not require temporal succession. God\u2019s acts can be\ncomplete in an instant. Alston includes God\u2019s acts of knowledge,\na stance that at least seems to conflict with one of the concessions\nhe made to Hartshorne regarding the first group of attributes.\n\nThe Boethian-Thomistic notion of the specious present for God, on the\nanalogue of a human being\u2019s perceiving some temporally extended\nstretch of a process in one temporally indivisible act, is also\ndefended by Alston. For example, one can perceive the flight of a bee\n\u201call at once\u201d without first perceiving the first half of\nthe stretch of flight and then perceiving the second. One\u2019s\nperception can be without temporal succession even if the object of\none\u2019s perception is, in fact, temporally successive. All we have\nto do, on Alston\u2019s view, is expand our specious present to cover\nall of time and we have a model for God\u2019s awareness of the\nworld. This is a much more difficult project for Hartshorne to imagine\nthan it is for Alston. Apparently Alston thinks that it is easy to\nconceptualize God \u201cseeing\u201d Neanderthal man (or Adam),\nMoses, Jesus, and Dorothy Day all at once in their immediacy. Here\nAlston has a view similar to that of William Mann.\n\nBut even if it were possible to have nonsuccessive awareness\nof a vast succession, which Hartshorne would deny, it is even more\nimplausible, from Hartshorne\u2019s point of view, to claim, as does\nAlston, that God could have nonsuccessive responses to stages\nof that succession. It might make more sense for Alston to say\n\u201cindesponses\u201d or \u201cpresponses\u201d rather than\n\u201cresponses,\u201d as Creel would urge.\n\nIt is correct of Alston to notice that there is no loss in God, but\nthis is not incompatible with God\u2019s temporality, according to\nHartshorne. There can be succession in God without there being loss or\nperishing due to the fact that God\u2019s inheritance of what happens\nin the world and God\u2019s memory are ideal. Hartshorne thinks that\nthe future is incomplete and indeterminate for God as well as from our\nlimited perspective. Alston, by way of contrast, wants to defend a God\nwho is not strictly necessary in actuality, but is contingent,\ndespite the fact that God does not undergo temporal change,\nnor is God fluent. Hartshorne\u2019s defenders, by way of contrast,\nthink that one of the greatest virtues of process thinking is its\neffort to eliminate what they see as such self-contradiction in\nphilosophical theology.\n\nAlston\u2019s treatment of contrast 10, concerning absolute versus\nrelative perfection, follows from what he has said regarding contrasts\n8\u20139. Relative perfection in God, as opposed to absolute\nperfection, has a point only for a temporal being; hence God is\nabsolutely perfect, according to Alston. A being that does not\nsuccessively assume different states could not possibly surpass\nitself. Here, once again, Alston engages in linkage, thereby, at the\nvery least, confirming Hartshorne\u2019s belief that we need both to\nconsider the divine attributes together and to determine whether the\nclassical theist\u2019s linkage or the neoclassical theist\u2019s\nlinkage is more defensible. For the most past, Alston opts for\nclassical theism. Or more precisely, he thinks that the strongest\nconcept of God is acquired when we take a modified version of the\nneoclassical attributes in contrasts 1\u20134 and combine them with\nthe classical attributes in contrasts 5\u201310.\n\nThis rapproachement in Alston between classical theism and\nneoclassical theism is a step beyond James Ross\u2019s belief that\nthese are two competing descriptions of God at an impasse. Hartshorne\nseems to agree with Ross. Neoclassical, dipolar theism\nalready includes the best insights of classical theism, he\nthinks.\n\nFrom Hartshorne\u2019s point of view the linkage of attributes\nwithin the first group and within the second group\nneeds to be corrected by a greater concern for reticulating the\nattributes in these two groups. He thinks that an explanation is\nneeded regarding how Alston can be committed to both monopolar and\ndipolar theism. For example, Alston ends up defending the view that\nGod is changed by the objects God knows (pace the neoclassical,\ndipolar attributes), but these are not changes that occur in time\n(pace the classical, monopolar attributes). It is one thing,\nHartshorne thinks, to say that God exists in a nontemporal specious\npresent, and it is another to say that God is changed by temporal\nbeings in a nontemporal specious present. The former view is at least\nproblematic, he thinks, and the latter seems to be part of the\ntraditional classical theistic view wherein, from a Hartshornian\nperspective, inconsistency goes in the guise of mystery.\n",
