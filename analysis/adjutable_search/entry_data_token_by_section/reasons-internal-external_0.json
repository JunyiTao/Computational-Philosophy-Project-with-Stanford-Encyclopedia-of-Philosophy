    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Varieties of Internalism\n1.1 Varieties of Internalism\n\n\nIt is important to clarify that reasons internalism is a thesis\nabout normative (or justifying) reasons, not about\nmotivating (or explanatory) reasons. A normative\nreason is a consideration that counts in favor of or against doing\nsomething, whereas a motivating reason is an answer to the question,\n\u2018why did she do it?\u2019.  Clearly, motivating reasons are\nconnected to motivation; reasons internalism maintains the more\ninteresting claim that normative reasons are also closely connected to\nmotivation. For the remainder of this article, by \u2018reason\u2019\nwe will always mean normative reason.\n\n\nReasons internalism as we\u2019ve so far presented it is not yet a\nthesis. To get a thesis from this vague idea we must fill in a\ndetailed answer to the question: what sort of relation\nmust reasons bear to motivation, and in what sense of\n\u2018motivation\u2019? So the idea sketched thus far is really\na family of theses, each corresponding to a different way of filling in\nthe following schema:\n\nSchematic Internalism:\nEvery reason for action must bear relation R to motivational fact\nM.\n\n\nDifferent ways of spelling out relation R and motivational\nfact M correspond to different ways of trying to cash out the\nintuitive thought about Max and Caroline\u2019s reasons. Each way of\nfilling in a candidate for R and a candidate for M\nresults in a different thesis\u2014a version of reasons\ninternalism (henceforth for this article, a version of internalism).\nImportantly, since not all versions of internalism say the same thing,\nthere is no single question about whether internalism is correct.\nRather, there is a family of questions which raise very similar\nphilosophical issues.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the labels \u2018internalism\u2019 and even\n\u2018reasons internalism\u2019 are often used for different kinds of\nviews than the ones that are our topic here. For example,\n\u2018reasons internalism\u2019 is sometimes used as a name for the\nview that if something is morally wrong then there must be a reason not\nto do it. This view will be important to our discussion; to avoid\nconfusion we will follow the rival convention of calling it Moral\nRationalism.\n\n\nIn the terminology of Darwall (1983), reasons internalism is an\nexistence form of internalism, contrasting with\njudgment forms of internalism. According to existence\ninternalism, a consideration is a reason for an agent only if some\nmotivational fact about that agent obtains. According to judgment\ninternalism, an agent genuinely judges that she has a reason only if\nsome motivational fact about that agent obtains; see the entry on\n moral motivation.  \n Judgment forms of internalism play an important role in traditional\narguments for noncognitivist metaethical theories (see the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs. noncognitivism) \n but are a quite different issue from that discussed here.\n\n\nA \u2018reasons externalist\u2019 is someone who rejects reasons\ninternalism, maintaining that at least some reasons for action are not\nconnected to motivation in the way reasons internalism claims.\nHowever, since there are many different internalist theses about\nthe way in which reasons and motivation are related, there is no clear\nand unambiguous question of whether reasons externalism is correct.\nPhilosophers generally describe their views as\n\u2018externalist\u2019 if they reject any thesis they consider to\ninvolve an interesting and controversial dependence of reasons\non facts about motivation; it is most likely not fruitful to try here\nto adjudicate which theses these are. Externalists need not deny\nthat reasons are commonly connected to facts about motivation, but they\ncan attribute these connections to desires or dispositions that some\nagents have while others lack.\n1.1.1 Varying M\n\n\nAn important division among versions of reasons internalism is\nbetween what we will here call Motivation views and\nState views. According to Motivation views, the kind of\nmotivational fact that reasons require is a fact about what the agent\nis or can be motivated (i.e. moved through her own volition) to\ndo. According to State views, in contrast, the kind of\nmotivational fact that reasons require is not actually a fact about\nmotivation at all, but rather, that the agent has a certain kind of\nmotivational attitude\u2014a certain kind of psychological\nstate which plays a role in motivation. These states are often\ntaken to be desires, but can include other attitudes such as emotions,\nintentions, and aversions. Motivation and State views are often\nrun together, but we shall see that they have importantly different\nimplications. Motivation views do not, by themselves, require the\npresence of any particular kind of psychological state which does the\nmotivating, and State views do not, by themselves, require that the\nmotivating state which is present actually does any motivating.\n1.1.2 Varying R\n\n\nAnother very important distinction among versions of Internalism is\nbetween Actual and Counterfactual versions. The\nformer claim that if someone has a reason to do A, then it\nfollows by necessity that she actually is somewhat motivated\nto do A (on the Motivation version), or actually has\na desire that would be served by doing A (on the State\nversion). Counterfactual versions make weaker claims: that if someone\nhas a reason to do A, then it follows by necessity that\nshe would be motivated to some degree, or would\ndesire to do A, in circumstances of a particular kind.\n\n\nDifferent Counterfactual theories disagree over the nature of this\n\u201cparticular kind\u201d of circumstances: prominent\nproposals include (i) that the agent be in possession of full\ninformation, or at least not have any relevant false beliefs (Smith\n1994; Joyce 2001); (ii) that she have completed \u201ccognitive\npsychotherapy\u201d or that her attitudes have reached a state of\nreflective equilibrium (Brandt 1979); (iii) that she have a vivid\nawareness of all relevant contingencies (Darwall 1983); (iv) that she\ndeliberates faultlessly from her existing motivations (Williams 1979);\n(v) that she be practically rational (Korsgaard 1986)\u2014a\nsuggestion to which we shall return; and (vi) that she be ideally\nvirtuous\u2014a \u2018phronimos\u2019 (McDowell 1995).\n\n\nSome views which count by our classification as Counterfactual forms\nof internalism are too weak to be interesting. For example, consider\nthe thesis that if someone has a reason to do A, then it\nfollows by necessity that were she to be motivated to do everything\nthat she actually has a reason to do, she would be motivated to do\nA. This thesis is in some sense a variety of internalism\u2014after\nall, it posits a necessary connection between reasons and a certain\nkind of counterfactual about motivation. But given the way that\nthe counterfactual is specified, it is trivially true. Similar\naccusations can be and have been made about versions of this kind of\nthesis which invoke virtue, and perhaps also about those invoking\nrationality\u2014depending on how rationality is to be understood.\nIt should be noted that some philosophers (e.g. McDowell) who\naccept one or another of these weak theses are commonly considered to\nbe \u2018externalists\u2019 by themselves or others, because of their\nrejection of any stronger, more interesting, internalist thesis.\n\n\nBecause it is uncontroversial that an agent can have reasons to do\nthings that she is not actually motivated to do (particularly if she is\nunaware of those reasons), we will assume that interesting Motivation\nversions of internalism take Counterfactual forms. State versions\nof internalism, by contrast, can be interesting in both Counterfactual\nand Actual forms.\n1.2 The Philosophical Significance of Reasons Internalism\n\n\nThe different versions of reasons internalism are philosophically\ninteresting for a variety of reasons. But it is impossible\nto understand why these different theses have received so much\nattention as a group without appreciating one problem in particular\nthat is encountered by some kinds of reasons internalism. We call\nthis the Central Problem. We\u2019ll first introduce this\nproblem in its most familiar form for one famous version of reasons\ninternalism; we then generalize.\n1.2.1 The Humean Theory of Reasons\n\n\nOne of the historically most important versions of reasons\ninternalism is an Actual State view according to which the actual\nstates connected to reasons are desires. Due to its\nrough affinity to David Hume\u2019s view of the dependence of morality on\nthe passions, this view is often called the \u2018Humean Theory of\nReasons\u2019, despite controversy over whether Hume himself held any\nsuch view.\n\nThe Humean Theory of Reasons (HTR): If there\nis a reason for someone to do something, then she must have\nsome desire that would be served by her doing it.\n\n\nAlthough both are often called \u2018reasons internalism\u2019,\nthere are significant differences between HTR and Counterfactual\nMotivation versions of internalism. One can accept a\nCounterfactual Motivation view without accepting HTR (e.g.\nKorsgaard 1986), and one can accept HTR without accepting any\n(nontrivial) Counterfactual Motivation view (e.g. Schroeder\n2007b). However, these two internalist theses are often\nlinked. Consider the following popular view about motivation,\nwhich, following Smith (1987), we call the Humean Theory of\nMotivation (again despite controversy over whether Hume himself\nheld it):\n\nThe Humean Theory of Motivation (HTM):\nDesires are necessary and beliefs are not sufficient for\nmotivation.\n\n\nIf (as Counterfactual Motivation versions of internalism claim) an\nagent has no reason to do A if there is no possibility of her being\nmotivated to do A, and if (as HTM claims) there is no possibility of an\nagent\u2019s being motivated to do A if she has no desire that could\nmotivate her to do A, then it seems to follow that an agent has no\nreason to do A if she has no desire that could motivate her to do\nA. This is the classical argument for HTR, which we will evaluate\nin section 2.1.1.\n1.2.2 The Central Problem\n\n\nThe Humean Theory of Reasons, along with other Actual State versions\nof internalism, is philosophically important because of a Central\nProblem motivating much ethical theorizing since the 1940s, which\nderives from a tension between HTR, Moral Rationalism (see section\n1.1), and Moral Absolutism:\n\nMoral Absolutism: Some actions are morally\nwrong for any agent no matter what motivations and desires they\nhave.\n\n\nFor example, presumably it was morally wrong for Hitler to order a\nprogram of genocide, even if it served some of his desires and wasn\u2019t\ndetrimental to any of them. (The characteristic of morality that Moral\nAbsolutism expresses is sometimes described, following Immanuel Kant,\nas its consisting of \u2018categorical\u2019 rather than\n\u2018hypothetical\u2019 imperatives; see the entry on\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy.) \n If (as Moral Rationalism claims) an action (like ordering genocide)\nis morally wrong for an agent (like Hitler) only if there is a reason\nfor him not to do it, and if (as HTR claims) there is a reason for him\nnot to do it only if he has some desire that would be served by his\nnot doing it, then it follows that whether an action is morally wrong\nfor an agent depends upon what he or she desires. But that seems incompatible\nwith Moral Absolutism. So it seems we must reject at least one of HTR,\nMoral Rationalism, and Moral Absolutism.\n\n\nIn response to this dilemma one could reject Moral\nAbsolutism\u2014either by embracing a form of moral relativism,\naccording to which all moral duties vary according to agents\u2019\ncontingent characteristics (e.g. Harman 1975), or by embracing a\nmoral error theory, accepting that moral claims are\nsystematically false because they presuppose the existence of external\nreasons while in actuality there are none (e.g. Mackie 1977;\nJoyce 2001). On this view, we might think that it was\nmorally wrong for Hitler to order genocide, and hence that he had\nreasons not to do so, but we would be mistaken. Alternatively,\none could reject Moral Rationalism and deny that the moral wrongness of\nan act entails that there is a reason not to do it (e.g. Foot\n1972). On this view, it is possible that Hitler\u2019s deeds\nwere morally wrong yet he had no reason not to perform them. Many\nphilosophers, however, prefer to preserve these commonsense theses\nabout morality\u2014and our ability to say that Hitler had reasons not\nto act as he did\u2014by rejecting HTR, along with other Actual State\nversions of internalism. The tension among these views is a big\npart of what motivates philosophical interest in whether all reasons\nare related to motivation in the way that some internalist thesis\nclaims.\n1.2.3 Generalizing\n\n\nPhilosophers concerned with the Central Problem have mainly directed\ntheir criticisms at the Humean Theory of Reasons, but in fact any\nActual State version of reasons internalism will lead to a structurally\nsimilar problem. Any Actual State version of reasons internalism\nsays that to have a reason, an agent must have some corresponding\nactual motivational state. But this is precisely what makes\nreasons hostage to an agent\u2019s actual psychology, creating the\ntension with Moral Rationalism and Moral Absolutism.\n\n\nDoes the Central Problem similarly arise for Counterfactual versions\nof reason internalism? The answer is: it depends upon the nature\nof the counterfactual condition a particular version of internalism\nrequires. There is no such tension if this is a condition under\nwhich any agent would be motivated, no matter what motivations and\ndesires she actually has. For example, Christine Korsgaard (1986)\nadvocates a Counterfactual Motivation internalism, and Michael Smith\n(1994) advocates a Counterfactual State internalism, on which it is\nnecessarily the case that any agent whatsoever would act in the same\nway as every other, if they satisfied those counterfactual\nconditions. Smith grounds his claim in optimism that no matter\nwhat desires they started with, if every agent was to resolve conflicts\nbetween their own desires under the condition of full information, they\nwould converge on the same set of desires. Consequently, what an\nagent would desire under those conditions does not depend on what she is\nactually like. So what is wrong for an agent can depend on what\nshe has a reason to do (as Moral Rationalism claims), without depending\non what she is like (which would put it in tension with what Moral\nAbsolutism claims). Smith calls his view an \u2018Anti-Humean\ntheory of reasons\u2019 in order to contrast it with Counterfactual State\ntheories which do give rise to the problem that confronts HTR.\n\n\nOn the other hand, many Counterfactual versions of reasons internalism\ndo hold that whether their counterfactuals are true of some agent must\nbe grounded in some actual feature of that agent.  These views\nencounter the Central Problem, because they hold that what an agent\nhas reason to do depends on whether some counterfactual is true of\nher, and that whether that counterfactual is true of her depends on\nwhat she is actually like. So, for example, Richard Joyce (2001)\naccepts Smith\u2019s Anti-Humean theory of reasons, but rejects\nSmith\u2019s claim that under conditions of full information and the\nresolution of conflicting desires all agents would converge on the\nsame desires, on the grounds that the desires an agent would have at\nthe end of this process depend upon the desires he started\nwith. (Notice that all Counterfactual versions of internalism of this\nkind can be re-formulated as Actual State versions of\ninternalism\u2014where the actual state is being such that\ncertain counterfactuals are true of you.)\n1.3 Explanatory Direction\n\n\nA final preliminary distinction between internalist views concerns\ntheir direction of explanation. As characterized thus\nfar, the various internalist theses merely posit a necessary connection\nbetween the existence of reasons, on the one hand, and facts about\nmotivation or motivational states, on the other, and do not distinguish\nbetween competing ways of explaining this necessary connection.\nDo we have reasons because we have (counterfactual or actual)\nmotivation or desire, or do we have motivation or desire\nbecause we have reasons? (Or is there some third possibility?)\nThe Humean Theory of Reasons is standardly understood to claim not only\nthat we have reasons only if we have certain desires, but\nfurther that we have those reasons because we have those\ndesires. We interpret it accordingly in the rest of this\narticle.\n\nHTR (revised): If there is a reason for\nsomeone to do something, then she must have some desire that would be\nserved by her doing it, which is the source of her reason.\n\n\nIt is natural to understand any Actual State internalist view as\nclaiming this direction of explanation. Since there surely can be\nnormative reasons for an agent to act of which she is unaware, it is\nimplausible that a consideration could be a reason for her to act only\nif she has an actual motivating state because of it.\n\n\nCounterfactual Motivation views, however, can adopt either direction\nof explanation, and a variety of philosophers insist that the existence\nof reasons explains the relevant facts about motivation rather than\nvice versa. Consider the popular thesis that if there is a reason\nfor someone to do something, then necessarily if she is fully\nrational she will be motivated to do it. The most trivial\naccount of this kind suggests that \u2018fully rational\u2019 simply\nmeans motivated by all one\u2019s reasons. If this is the\ntruth in internalism, however, it places no constraints whatsoever on\nwhat can and cannot be an agent\u2019s practical reason; for this reason it\nis often called an externalist thesis. But the explanatory\npriority of reasons over motivation can also yield a nontrivial version\nof internalism. Consider again the thesis appealing to a\ncondition of full rationality. If by \u2018rationality\u2019 we\nmean a substantive psychological capacity involving\nparticular desires or dispositions that enable us to respond to\nreasons, then we have a form of internalism that places substantive\nconstraints on what can and cannot be a reason. For example,\nChristine Korsgaard (1986) advocates such a nontrivial version of\ninternalism, taking the counterfactual about motivation under the\ncondition of rationality to be explained by a substantive (non-trivial)\naccount of practical rationality. According to Korsgaard, an\nagent is only rational if she is consistently motivated in accordance\nwith some general principles that provide her conception of her\npractical identity. Given this account of rationality, the\ninternalist thesis above tells us that only those considerations that\nwould motivate such a principle-governed agent can be reasons for her\nto act.\n2. Indirect, Theoretical Arguments\n\n\nIn evaluating whether any particular variety of internalism about\nreasons is true philosophers have brought many different kinds of\nresources to bear. In sections 2.1\u20132.3 we look at indirect,\ntheoretical arguments which bear one way or another. Then in part\n3 we consider more direct arguments, based on intuitive judgments about\nwhat reasons there are.\n2.1 Motivational Arguments\n\n\nA central consideration adduced in support of internalist theses is\nthe conceptual link between reasons and explanation. In\nan influential early discussion of reasons for action, Donald Davidson\n(1963) observed that a common form of explanation of why an agent acted\nas she did involves citing the reasons she had to act that\nway. He argued that because actions are always to be explained in\nterms of psychological states, we can identify reasons for actions with\nthe desire-belief pairs that cause them. Since Davidson\u2019s concern\nwas with what explains actual action, rather than with what\njustifies prospective action, his discussion might seem to\nconcern motivating reasons rather than normative reasons. But\nDavidson took his reasons to \u201crationalize\u201d or justify as\nwell as to explain action, and many philosophers subsequently concluded\nthat the two kinds of reasons had to be closely, conceptually,\nconnected.\n\n\nA common and plausible view is that to be an agent\u2019s motivating\nreason for acting, a consideration has to be something which that agent\ntakes to be a normative reason for acting (Dancy 2000; see Setiya 2007\nfor objections). At the very least, it seems that it must be\npossible for an agent to be motivated by her normative reasons (Nagel\n1970). This possibility is in tension with the commonly drawn\ndistinction between motivating reasons as psychological states and\nnormative reasons as facts or propositions (Smith 1994), which places\nthese types of reasons in different ontological categories.\n\n\nThis view, which understands motivating or explanatory reasons in\nterms of normative reasons, offers no obvious support to any version of\ninternalism. It holds that if an agent has a motivating reason\nfor acting, then she is motivated by something she takes to be\na normative reason. But it does not follow from this (and is\noften denied by proponents of this view) that she has or thinks she has\na normative reason only if she is relevantly motivated, as internalism\nrequires. Views that rather understand normative reasons in terms\nof explanatory reasons, however, yield a distinct kind of argument for\nsome form of internalism. Bernard Williams advances just this\nkind of argument in his classic but commonly misunderstood article\n\u2018Internal and External Reasons\u2019. We first (section 2.1.1)\nsketch the Classical Argument, attributed to Williams on the standard\nreading of his article, and then (section 2.1.2) sketch an alternative\nargument that Williams may have intended instead.\n2.1.1 The Classical Argument\n\n\nWilliams claims that normative reasons have an \u2018explanatory\ndimension\u2019. On a standard reading what he means by this is\nthat a consideration can be a normative reason for some agent only if\nit is possible (i.e. would under certain conditions be the case)\nthat the agent be motivated to act for that reason, and for it thereby\nto be explanatory of his acting. This first premise of the\nclassical argument is, of course, just a statement of some version of\nCounterfactual Motivation internalism. Here a Counterfactual\nMotivation form of internalism is assumed as a conceptual truth in\norder to argue for an Actual State internalism; any argument proceeding\nfrom such a premise naturally has no force for those externalists who\ndeny even the Counterfactual Motivation internalist thesis. The\nsecond premise of the argument is HTM, the Humean Theory of\nMotivation. If the existence of reasons entails the possibility\nof motivation, and the possibility of motivation entails the existence\nof desire, then the existence of reasons entails the existence of\ndesire\u2014as the Humean Theory of Reasons maintains.\n\n\nThis argument, however, has many widely observed weaknesses.\nFirst, it depends on HTM, so it dismisses an idea that many\nphilosophers have accepted; namely, that beliefs (either in general or\nof a specific kind, such as beliefs about reasons) can motivate action\nby themselves and independently of desire (e.g. Nagel 1970;\nDarwall 1983; Dancy 2000).\n\n\nA second problem arises about how to understand the relevant sense\nof \u2018possibility of motivation\u2019, which links the two\npremises. To say that motivation is possible is\nequivalent to saying that under certain conditions it would be actual.\nTo understand the relevant sense of possibility, we therefore\nneed to identify the relevant conditions under which, according to the\nargument, there would be motivation. The problem is that the two\npremises seem to require for their plausibility different conditions,\nand therefore different senses of \u2018possibility\u2019. In\nthe case of the first premise, connecting the existence of reasons with\nthe possibility of motivation, the existence of reasons plausibly\nentails the \u2018possibility\u2019 of motivation in only a very weak\nsense: perhaps nothing stronger than that the agent would be\nmotivated if he were rational, or perhaps virtuous. In the case\nof the second premise, linking the possibility of motivation with the\nexistence of desire, a much stronger sense of \u2018possibility\u2019\nis arguably needed: something like there being some conditions\nunder which the agent with his actual psychological state would be\nmotivated.\n\n\nIf we were to read the former, weaker sense of the possibility of\nmotivation into this second premise, we get the claim that a rational,\nor perhaps virtuous, version of the agent would only be motivated to\nact in some way if the actual agent has some actual desire that could\nproduce that motivation. This premise would be false if agents\ncould be irrational or vicious precisely because they lack certain\ndesires, a common view we discussed in section 1.3. Suppose we\ntry instead to understand the first premise in terms of the stronger\nsense of possibility suggested for the second premise. This\nyields the claim that an agent can have a reason to act in some way\nonly if there are some possible conditions under which he would be\nmotivated to act in that way due to psychological attitudes that he\nactually has. Interpreted in this way the first premise\nbegs the question against Williams\u2019 externalist opponent, because\nit seems already to be a statement of an Actual State version of\ninternalism.\n\n\nIt seems that there is no interpretation of \u2018possibility of\nmotivation\u2019 for which it is plausible that both premises are true\nand avoid begging the question against externalism. The Classical\nArgument therefore seems to have either implausibly strong premises, a\nproblematic inference, or both.\n2.1.2 An Argument from Explanation\n\n\nBut Williams may not have intended to offer this argument. On\na rival and unorthodox interpretation (Finlay 2009), Williams\u2019 claim that\npractical reasons have an \u201cexplanatory dimension\u201d is\nto be understood not simply as placing a constraint on what can be a\nreason, but as providing the essential meaning of our thoughts and\nclaims about practical reasons. On this analysis the concept of a\n\u2018reason for action\u2019 just is the concept of an explanation\nof action, following Davidson. To think that the fact that the\nAlcove serves onion rings the size of doughnuts is a reason\nfor Caroline to go there, is to think that the fact that the Alcove\nserves such onion rings is an explanation of Caroline\u2019s\ngoing there.\n\n\nAs Williams observes, any view of this Davidsonian kind has to\novercome an obvious problem. We can have reasons which do not\nmotivate us to act (e.g. if we are unaware of them), and we can\nact in ways for which we lack any actual practical reasons (e.g.\nif we are mistaken about what our reasons are). Identifying an\nagent\u2019s practical reasons, it seems, neither entails nor is\nentailed by giving an explanation of her actions. On this\nreading, Williams suggests that this problem arises simply due to\nagents\u2019 error and ignorance, and he offers a way to fix the\nDavidsonian approach. To think that a fact is a reason for an\nagent to act is not to think it is an explanation of an action that she\nactually performs, but rather it is to think it an explanation\nof an action that she would have performed (or would have been\nsomewhat motivated towards performing) if not for her error or\nignorance. The concept of a practical reason must be the concept\nof an explanation of counterfactual (motivation towards) action:\naction under the condition of full and valid reasoning and exercise of\nimagination from a belief-set purged of error and ignorance\n(\u2018sound deliberation\u2019). He claims that the\nidealization contained in this counterfactual condition is enough to\nmake these reasons normative and not merely explanatory.\n\n\nFrom this understanding of the concept of a practical reason, Williams\n(on this interpretation) believes he can prove that all\n\u2018external reasons statements\u2019 are false by considering the\nspecial case of first personal reasons beliefs: an agent\u2019s\nbeliefs about what considerations are reasons for himself. This\nargument requires a further assumption: that R is a reason\nfor an agent to do A only if he could, through sound\ndeliberation, come to recognize it as a reason for his\ndoing A.  This assumption seems reasonable given the\nconceptual premise, that the notion of a \u2018reason for\naction\u2019 is just some notion of an explanation of action. A\n\u2018reason for an agent\u2019 would then plausibly be an\nexplanation for that agent, and it is plausible that what can\nbe an explanation for an agent is restricted to what the agent is able\nto come to recognize as an explanation.\n\n\nWilliams is concerned with what the agent comes to believe when he\ncomes to believe that some consideration R is a reason for\nhim to do A. Granted the conceptual premise, an\n\u2018internal reasons statement\u2019 is a claim that some\nconsideration is an explanation of why by virtue of the contents\nof the agent\u2019s actual \u2018motivational set\u2019 he would be\nmotivated to do A under the conditions of sound deliberation,\nwhile an \u2018external reasons statement\u2019 is a claim that some\nconsideration is an explanation of why independently of the\ncontents of the agent\u2019s actual motivational set he would be\nmotivated to do A under those conditions.\n\n\nWhile Williams is commonly interpreted as challenging the possibility\nof an agent being motivated to do A by the belief that he has\nan external reason R to do A, on this reading he\nexplicitly accepts that such motivation is possible; a\ndisposition to be motivated by the belief that you have an external\nreason could be an element of your motivational set, making the fact\nthat you have an external reason itself an internal reason\nfor you to act. (It is an advantage of this interpretation that this\nis what Williams actually says.)\n\n\nUnfortunately, the fact that an agent\u2019s belief that R is an\nexternal reason to do A can motivate her to do A\ndoes not suffice to show that R is a reason to\ndo A. It only shows that the fact that R is a reason to\ndo A is a reason to do A. That is because it does not\nshow that R can explain the agent\u2019s motivation to herself; it\nonly shows that the fact that R is a reason for her to do A\ncan explain her motivation to herself. So what Williams wants to know\nis, how could it be\ntrue that R is a reason to do A? If it were true,\nrealizing that it was could motivate\u2014but what could make it\ntrue?\n\n\nAccording to this reading, the problem Williams sees for external\nreasons is the following. For there genuinely to be external reasons,\nhe observes, it must be possible that some such external reasons\nbeliefs are true. This requires that the\nconsideration R which an agent accepts as his reason must\nactually be a genuine explanation of his acting under the condition of\nsound deliberation, independently of any facts about his motivational\nset.  But this condition cannot be met, because nothing could be\nexplanatory of an agent\u2019s action independently of the contents of his\nmotivational set: his desires and dispositions. From this it follows\n(given the conceptual premise) that no motivationally\n\u2018external\u2019 considerations could genuinely be practical\nreasons for an agent.\n\n\nHence, while many writers have come to the defense of external reasons\nby appealing to a disposition to be motivated by beliefs about\nreasons, if this interpretation is correct then Williams\u2019 argument is\ndirectly aimed against this kind of solution. A disposition of this\nkind could explain why a consideration R could motivate an\nagent once he believed that it was a reason to act, but it could not\nmake it the case that R itself was a genuine explanation of\nhis acting, and therefore a reason for him to act. To use Williams\u2019\nown example, if Owen Wingrave comes to believe that\nthe fact that military service is a family tradition is a reason\nfor him to enlist, that belief may indeed motivate him to enlist,\nand explain his doing so. But if he has no desires or\ndispositions that would cause the belief that military service is a\nfamily tradition itself to motivate him to enlist, then the fact\nthat military service is a family tradition cannot itself be a genuine\nexplanation of his enlisting, and therefore his belief that it is a\nreason for him to enlist is false.\n\n\nAlthough Williams\u2019 article is commonly seen as the classic defense of\nHTR, on this reading it only restricts agents\u2019 reasons to their\ndispositions to be motivated, and not more narrowly to their actual\ndesires. This is because dispositions are sufficient, and actual\ndesires not necessary, in order to explain why somebody would be\nmotivated under counterfactual conditions. This argument is therefore\nstronger than the Classical Argument because of its independence from\nHTM, which controversially claims that motivation requires desire. But\nthe view supported by this argument is not a weak, Counterfactual\nMotivation version of internalism; rather it is a more general kind of\nActual State view, claiming a connection between reasons and all\npsychological states relevant to the explanation of action. Indeed,\nWilliams\u2019 skepticism about \u2018external reasons\u2019 would then\nbe directed not against those who reject Counterfactual Motivation\naccounts\u2014he just assumes that his opponent agrees with him that\nreasons must be able to motivate\u2014but against many philosophers\nwho have championed some Counterfactual Motivation version of\ninternalism, like Nagel (1970) and Darwall (1983).  These philosophers\nargue that the order of explanation runs in the other direction: that\nthe possibility of being motivated to do A can be explained\nby the existence of a reason to do A, while Williams\u2019 view is\nthat the existence of a reason to do A must be explained by\nthe possibility of being motivated to do A.\n\n\nThe weakest point in this version of Williams\u2019 argument is probably\nits fundamental, conceptual premise: that the concept of a practical\nreason is the concept of an explanation of action under certain\nconditions. Even if we grant the controversial claim that the concept\nof a practical reason is the concept of an explanation we can\nstill resist this analysis. Suppose, for example, that the concept of\na reason to do A is the concept of an explanation of why\nto do A, or of why doing A is a good thing to do. To say\nthat R was the reason for which the agent did A\nwould then be to say that R was the explanation of why to\ndo A which motivated the agent to do A. This rival\naccount respects the conceptual relation between \u2018reason\u2019\nand \u2018explanation\u2019 on which Williams and Davidson insist,\nbut doesn\u2019t analyze practical reasons as any kind of explanation of\naction. If this is what our concept of practical reasons\nis, then a different argument will be needed if we are to rule out the\npossibility of external reasons.\n2.1.3 Other Motivational Arguments\n\n\nA different kind of argument specifically for the Humean Theory of\nReasons tries to reason from some kind of Counterfactual Motivation\ninternalism by raising questions about the concepts of action and\nmotivation in play (Finlay 2007). Necessarily, a rational agent\nis motivated by recognition of her reasons. But this motivated\nbehavior is not merely caused by her reasons; it is a voluntary\nresponse to them. A rational agent responds\nvoluntarily to her reasons.\n\n\nA connection is then forged between voluntary behavior and\ndesire. Arguably, a behavior is only voluntary if it is caused by\nbeing aimed at. On one theory of desire, aiming at\np entails desiring something (either p itself, or\nsomething to which p is taken to be a means). It follows\nthat a rational agent\u2019s recognition of a reason entails the\npresence of a relevant desire. This does not yet rule out\nexternalism, which is compatible with this result if any of a number of\ndifferent claims are true. The internalist can try to close off\nthese escapes, however. (i) One possible externalist solution is\nthat being rational involves having certain desires; the internalist\ncan argue in response that rationality is rather a procedural virtue\nwhich doesn\u2019t necessarily involve having any particular desires.\n(ii) Another solution is to suggest that a rational agent\u2019s\nability to recognize reasons is limited by her desires; the internalist\ncan plausibly respond that being (ideally) rational is, by definition,\nto be able to recognize all one\u2019s reasons. (iii) Perhaps\nmost promisingly, an externalist can suggest that a rational agent can\nrespond voluntarily to her reasons by virtue of their causing her to\nhave a new desire (Darwall 1983). The internalist may counter by\narguing that because we cannot desire at will, the causation of such a\ndesire would be a nonvoluntary response to the recognition of a reason,\nand therefore any behavior motivated by that desire\u2014even if\nvoluntary\u2014would not qualify as a voluntary response to the\nreason.\n\n\nThis line of argument has not yet received much attention; opponents\nmay reasonably question whether motivation by reasons must always be\nvoluntary (this seems implausible in the case of theoretical\nreasons, or reasons for belief, for example\u2014see section 2.2\nbelow for this analogy), and also whether voluntary behavior must be\ncaused by desire.  For yet a different promising argument for\ninternalism on the basis of the connection between reasons and\nmotivational capacities, see section 4 of (Markovits 2011).\n2.2 The Analogy to Theoretical Reason\n\n\nExternalists often appeal to the parallels between practical reasons\n(reasons for action) and epistemic or theoretical\nreasons (or reasons for belief) to make their case against\ncertain forms of internalism, particularly the Humean Theory of Reasons\n(Millgram 1996). They seem to be different species of the same\ngenus: while practical reasons are facts that support or justify\ncertain actions, theoretical reasons are facts that support or justify\ncertain beliefs. Both sorts of reasons are subsumable under the\nclass of normative reasons, or facts that support certain\nbehaviors.\n\n\nBut externalists object that it is implausible that reasons for\nbelief entail or depend upon facts about desire or motivation.\nRational belief is responsive only to evidence, and\nbeliefs formed on the basis of desires (like a husband\u2019s wishful\nbelief\u2014in the face of all the evidence\u2014that his wife is not\ncheating on him) are irrational. So not all\nnormative reasons are internal reasons. Internalism about\npractical reasons might therefore seem arbitrary and\nunmotivated. Once we\u2019ve allowed external reasons that count in\nfavor of believing certain things, why not allow external reasons that\ncount in favor of doing certain things? Elijah Millgram (1996) suggests that\njust as new experiences can reveal to us hitherto unknown reasons for\nbelief, so too new experiences (involving unexpected pleasures) can\nreveal to us reasons for action independent of our antecedent desires\nand dispositions.\n\n\nInternalists have two options here. They can deny that genuine\nreasons for belief can be external, extending their internalism to\ntheoretical reasons, or they can seek to motivate differential\ntreatment of the practical and the theoretical cases. To pursue\nthe former course, internalists might argue that we ascribe reasons for\nbelief on the assumption of a desire for knowledge or truth (see Kelly\n2003 for discussion). They can further argue that a person is\nsimply not in the business of forming beliefs if he does not\nhave something resembling a desire for truth (Velleman 2000).\nAlternatively, internalists might argue that we ascribe reasons for\nbelief on the assumption that whatever the contents of a person\u2019s\ndesire-set, it will include some item that would be served by believing\nthat for which there is evidence.\n\n\nThe second strategy would involve identifying a relevant difference\nbetween practical and theoretical reasons to explain why internalism\nis true of reasons for action, but not of reasons for belief.  For\nexample, Markovits (2011) argues that the practical case is different\nbecause there is no analogue to the plausible case\nof foundational beliefs in the epistemic case. A different\nstrategy might focus on differences in the nature or aims of\naction and belief. Suppose for example that\nwhile believing by its nature aims at tracking the truth, acting by its\nnature aims at satisfying some desire of the agent. We could then\nreasonably maintain that practical but not theoretical reasons can only\nbe internal.\n2.3 Arguments from Reactive Attitudes\n\n\nAn important part of the debate about internal and external reasons\nhas centered on \u2018reactive attitudes\u2019, or attitudes that we\nhave towards agents in response to their behavior, of which blame is\nthe paradigm. Some have observed in defense of Moral Rationalism,\nfor example, that if an agent does something we consider morally wrong,\nthen we blame (or resent) her. But blame, these philosophers\nclaim, involves the judgment that the agent had reasons not to do what\nhe did. Consequently blame is unwarranted when such judgments are\nunwarranted (Nagel 1970, Smith 1994). Therefore, since moral\nwrongdoing is sufficient to warrant blame, moral obligations must\nentail reasons. Furthermore, Moral Absolutism tells us that the\nmoral wrongness of certain actions is independent of agents\u2019 desires\nand dispositions. Since wrongness entails the appropriateness of\nblame, which in turn entails existence of reasons, we can conclude that\nthere must be reasons that are independent of agents\u2019 desires and\ndispositions: i.e. external reasons.\n\n\nA difficulty for this argument comes from the fact that outside of\nmorality we do not, in general, blame or resent people for failing to\ncomply with their practical reasons. If an agent does something\nfoolish or imprudent, for example, we might react with pity or scorn,\nbut not with anything as strong as blame. It seems that the\nappropriateness of blame requires some condition other than\nnoncompliance with reasons. This does not show that noncompliance\nwith reasons is not one of the necessary conditions for blame, of\ncourse, but it opens the possibility that once we identify the further\nnecessary conditions we might find that they are also, by themselves,\nsufficient conditions for appropriate blame. The internalist\nmight suggest, for example, that the missing condition is partly that\nthe judge have desires or concerns that are harmed by the\nresented behavior. Proponents of the argument from blame may\nrespond that it is inappropriate to blame harmful non-agents (like\ntrees and tigers) and agents whose harms are unintentional.\nHowever it may be possible to excuse these from blame without accepting\nthat noncompliance with reasons is a necessary condition for\nblameworthiness; for example, with the weaker condition that a\nblameworthy act stems from having a character from which certain\nconcerns or motivations are absent (Arpaly 2003). Trees and\ntigers don\u2019t have a \u2018character\u2019 in the relevant\nsense, and harms that an agent causes unintentionally do not stem from\nher character. If something like this is a sufficient condition\nfor blameworthiness, then this argument from reactive attitudes\nfails.\n\n\nBernard Williams does not resist the claim that the appropriateness\nof blame entails reasons, however, and offers a way of explaining the\nappropriateness of blame when an agent appears to have no relevant\ninternal reasons to act otherwise than she did. Blaming in these\ncases functions as a \u2018proleptic mechanism\u2019: it itself\nchanges the situation for the agent so that she now has an internal\nreason that she otherwise would have lacked (1989). This is a\nreason she has in virtue of something like \u2018a disposition to have\nthe respect of other people\u2019. By blaming or being disposed\nto blame an agent for unethical behavior, we give her a reason to act\nethically. Note that this account understands the appropriateness\nof blame as at least partly instrumental. Blaming is appropriate\nif it has some motivational grip on the agent. This view is\nresisted by many who see the question of the appropriateness of a\nreactive attitude as primarily an issue of desert. Arguably,\nblame is appropriate only if it is deserved, and not if it is merely\neffective in influencing people\u2019s behavior.\n\n\nIt is also possible to appeal to reactive attitudes in arguing\nagainst external reasons. Williams argues that\nexternalism cannot accommodate the obscurity and indeterminacy in the\npractice of blame: that is, the pattern predicted by his\ninternalist account that blame sometimes responds to reasons and at\nother times tries to create them, and that its appropriateness turns on\nwhether the agent can be influenced psychologically in either of these\nways.\n\n\nRuss Shafer-Landau finds in Williams\u2019 article the suggestion of a\nfurther argument, turning on the fairness constraint on appropriate\nblame (2003: 181\u20132). Blame is only appropriate if it is fair, and\nit is only fair to blame someone for their behavior if they had the\ncapacity to act otherwise than they did. But an agent\u2019s capacity\nto act is limited by her desires and dispositions, and therefore blame\nis only appropriate if an agent\u2019s desires and dispositions gave her the\ncapacity to act otherwise. This is a challenge for externalism\nbecause of the suggested connection between blame and reasons we\ndiscussed above: an agent is blameworthy for her action only if\nin so acting she failed to obey her\n reasons.[1]\nIt follows that an agent\u2019s\nreasons must be limited by her desires and dispositions; some form of\ninternalism is true.\n\n\nThis argument can succeed only if supported by a plausible version\nof the \u2018ought implies can\u2019 principle. But in basing\nan agent\u2019s capacity to act on her desires and dispositions, the\nversion of the principle that the argument seems to presuppose treats\n\u2018ought\u2019, or the fairness of blame, as depending on the\npsychological capacity to act rather than on the mere\nphysical capacity to act. Externalists would reject as\nimplausible the psychological version of the principle, and therefore\nto assume it for purposes of an internalist argument would be\nquestion-begging against the externalist.\n2.4 The Conditional Fallacy\n\n\n(Nontrivial) Counterfactual Motivation versions of internalism are\nsometimes accused of committing a \u2018conditional\nfallacy\u2019 (named by Shope (1978)). To commit this \u2018fallacy\u2019 is to claim that\nit is necessary for an agent\u2019s having a reason to do A that\nhe would be motivated under certain conditions to do A, when\nthere are some reasons that the agent can have only if precisely those\nconditions do not obtain. For example, some versions of internalism\nappeal to counterfactuals involving full rationality, but sometimes\nagents have certain reasons precisely because they are not fully\nrational. Smith (1994) offers the case, due to Gary Watson, of a\ndefeated squash player who, because he is prone to irrational anger\nthat could cause him to smash his opponent\u2019s face with his racquet,\nhas a reason not to cross the court to shake the winner\u2019s hand. When\nthe conditions specified by the relevant internalist thesis do obtain,\nthe reason is then not present to motivate the agent, falsifying the\ncounterfactual. For example, were Watson\u2019s squash player to be fully\nrational, then it would no longer be true that if he crossed the court\nhe might hit his opponent, and therefore he wouldn\u2019t be motivated\naccordingly not to cross the court. The relevant internalist thesis\nthen yields the false result that the irrational squash player has no\nreason not to cross the court.\n\n\nIn defense of his own internalist thesis, involving counterfactual\nmotivation under the condition of sound deliberation from full\ninformation, Williams (1995) raises an objection of this kind against\nMcDowell\u2019s rival claim involving the condition of full\nvirtue. He observes that being less than fully virtuous\ngives agents reasons to act that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have\nhad and that therefore would not motivate a fully virtuous agent.\nOthers object to Williams\u2019 own counterfactuals involving sound\ndeliberation that there are reasons that agents have precisely because\nthey are not capable of deliberating soundly, which his version of\ninternalism therefore fails to accommodate.\n\n\nIt is plausible that objections of this kind will be effective against\nany nontrivial Counterfactual Motivation version of internalism. This\nproblem has prompted some to switch from a Counterfactual Motivation\nmodel to a Counterfactual State model, and others to be more\ncareful about specifying just what state they have in mind. The idea\nis that an agent S has a reason to do\nA only if, were she in certain counterfactual circumstances,\nshe would desire S in her actual circumstances to\ndo A (Smith 1994). Michael Smith calls this\nthe advice model (in contrast to the example model),\nand it plausibly avoids the problems connected with the\n\u2018conditional fallacy\u2019 because it builds in sensitivity to\nthe relevant conditions in the actual cases that generate the\nreasons. For example, if a fully rational version of Watson\u2019s squash\nplayer were to contemplate the situation of his actual, less than\nfully-rational self, he would be aware of his actual self\u2019s\ndisposition to irrational anger, and would therefore want his actual\nself not to cross the court to shake the winner\u2019s hand. The advice\nmodel may therefore yield the correct result that the actual player\nhas a reason not cross the court. However, as Bedke (2010) emphasizes,\nthis leaves an important puzzle about why each agent\u2019s counterfactual,\nmore fully rational self, would have desires about what her actual\nself does.\n3. Direct, Extensional Arguments\n\n\nFortunately we do not ordinarily need to turn to a metaethical theory\nto tell us what reasons we have. People have a robust set of\nintuitions about what is and what is not a reason for a given agent to\nperform a given action. All nontrivial versions of reasons internalism\nand externalism have substantive implications concerning the extension\nof agents\u2019 reasons, and for the most part theory here is answerable to\ncommon sense and aims at accommodating it. Some of the most\nsignificant and compelling arguments for and against versions of\ninternalism are therefore extensional, that is to say, based on what\nreasons agents actually have. An internalist account\u2019s predictions\nabout what is and what is not a reason for a particular agent can be\ntested against our prior judgments about what reasons there are.\n3.1 For Externalism\n3.1.1 Undergeneration Arguments\n\n\nWe have already encountered one of the most powerful sources of\nextensional opposition to nontrivial versions of reasons internalism\nin the form of the Central Problem. The Central Problem is that it\nseems that some actions are wrong for everyone no matter what they are\nlike, and that their wrongness for someone requires that that person\nhave a reason not to do them. But many kinds of internalism\u2014in\nparticular Actual State views\u2014say that an agent has a reason\nonly if she satisfies a certain condition, and hence that her reason\ndepends on what she is like. We can even frame the Central Problem by\ndivorcing it from Moral Rationalism and Moral Absolutism, and simply\ninsisting that for at least some actions (perhaps paradigmatic wrong\nactions among them), there is a reason for anyone not to do those\nactions, no matter what she is like. This leads to a direct argument\nagainst many forms of internalism: that they\nundergenerate reasons, by providing negative verdicts in cases\nin which intuitively there really are reasons.\n\n\nBecause this sort of argument has not always gotten a grip on those\nskeptical about the objective authority of morality, one important\ndevelopment since the 1970s is the observation that a similar sort of\nproblem arises for prudential reasons (e.g. Nagel\n1970). If I am going to travel to Israel in six months\u2019 time and\nwill regret not knowing any Hebrew once I get there, then I have a\nreason to study Hebrew now, even if I don\u2019t now care about my\nfuture regrets or about whether I will know Hebrew while I am in\nIsrael. Yet internalist theses place constraints on what I\nnow have a reason to do, on the basis of what my actual\npsychology is like now, or on the basis of what\ncounterfactuals are true of me now. So they appear to\nhave a problem in getting these intuitive judgments about reasons\nright. This argument is thought to produce extra dialectical\nleverage, because these intuitions about prudential reasons are thought\nto be harder to give up than corresponding intuitions about moral\nreasons.\n3.1.2 Defenses Against Undergeneration Arguments\n\n\nTwo lines of response are open to the internalist here. One, proposed\nby Mark Schroeder (2007b) in defense of the Humean Theory of Reasons,\ndenies that internalism is genuinely incompatible with the\ninescapability of some moral or prudential reasons. If there are some\nactions that would serve any possible desire (or, on an alternative\ninternalist account, that any agent would be motivated towards under\nthe relevant counterfactual conditions), then the internalist can\naccommodate reasons that any agent has no matter what they are like:\nsuch reasons are massively overdetermined. In this way the\ninternalist can seek to reconcile Moral Rationalism with Moral\nAbsolutism (see section 1.2). The idea is that even if internalism is\ntrue, it might still be the case that we all have reasons to avoid\nmoral wrongdoing, no matter what we are like\u2014because reasons to\navoid moral wrongdoing are generated from any set of desires or\ndispositions.  While this solution is formally available, it remains\nto be seen whether it can plausibly generate the robust set of moral\nand prudential reasons posited by ordinary intuitions, and it appears\nreasonable to be pessimistic on this count; plausibly there are actual\nor possible sets of desires and dispositions that would not support\nany reasons to avoid breaking promises made to those powerless to\nretaliate, or to confess to one\u2019s crime for which somebody else has\nalready been convicted, for example.\n\n\nGenerally, however, internalists bite the bullet and reject the data\nof these \u2018intuitions\u2019. They might simply challenge whether\nthose intuitions really exist or, more audaciously, maintain that they\nare all false. It is not denied that speakers ascribe\nexternal reasons to agents, and so internalists are compelled to offer\ndiagnoses of this practice. The bluntest is to adopt an error\ntheory, and suggest that these practices manifest a mistaken\nunderstanding of the kinds of reasons that there are. This forces\na confrontation between internalism and ordinary practice; most\ninternalists dislike the odds in this matchup and seek to explain away\nthe evidence.\n\n\nA provocative diagnosis of external reasons claims is as a\nbluff or a rhetorical device designed to influence the\nbehavior and attitudes of others (Williams 1979). On this view\nexternal reasons claims are all false but stem from an attempt to apply\nnonrational persuasion on others rather than from error; recently some\nphilosophers have argued that we either do (Kalderon 2005) or should\n(Joyce 2001) use moral claims as convenient fictions for this\npurpose. In later work (1989), Williams proposes, more\ntemperately, that they may be \u2018optimistic internal reasons\nclaims\u2019: likely false statements made in the hope that they\nmay become true through the intended audience\u2019s contemplation of\nthem.\n\n\nA more conciliatory strategy is to claim ambiguity in the notion of\na \u2018reason\u2019. In one sense there are external reasons;\nwe might call them \u2018institutional\u2019 or\n\u2018pseudo\u2019-reasons (Mackie 1977; Joyce 2001). But the\nspirit of internalism is preserved in the claim that these are not\ngenuine practical reasons, about which an internalist thesis is\ncorrect. Recognizing the legitimacy of ascribing these other\nkinds of reasons may suggest softening the distinction between internal\nand external reasons even further; it has been proposed that what\ncounts as a \u2018genuine reason\u2019 is determined by the concerns\ncharacterizing the context of discourse (Finlay 2006). So, for\nexample, we may appropriately judge that the pain a certain action\nwould cause is a reason for a sadist not to perform the\naction, because the salient concern in the context is our\ncompassion for others. This view would prompt us to abandon\nexistence internalism about practical \u2018reasons\u2019 (reasons claims\nare made relative to the concerns salient in the conversation, and not\nnecessarily to the motivations of the agent). On this view of\nreasons, however, an agent can have reasons that count as genuine in a\ngiven context, but that he can ignore without irrationality. Such\na view can preserve the spirit of internalism by claiming that the\nrational force of these reasons for any agent depends upon his desires\nor motivations.\n\n\nThese strategies aim to reconcile internalism, as much as possible,\nwith the apparently externalist tendencies in ordinary practices of\nascribing reasons. Externalists claim they are unsuccessful;\nordinary practice is committed to genuine (and genuinely authoritative)\nexternal reasons, and rightly so. But internalists remain\noptimistic. The issue is very much unresolved.\n3.1.3 Overgeneration Arguments\n\n\nThe literature is also full of extensional arguments against\ntheories which resemble internalism, but on the grounds that they\novergenerate, rather than undergenerate, reasons. Many famous\nand colorful examples\u2014about people who want to eat saucers of\nmud, or count blades of grass, or who have a disposition to turn on\nradios\u2014are offered to show that not every desire or motivation\nis of the right kind to generate practical reasons (Anscombe 1959,\nQuinn 1993). Strictly speaking, however, such cases only create\nobjections to views which postulate a\nsufficient condition for the existence of reasons, and\ninternalism itself postulates only necessary conditions, and\nno such sufficient condition, as Bernard Williams makes clear (1989),\nfor example.\n\n\nThere may, of course, be philosophical reasons why many theorists\nwho accept some version of internalism as a necessary condition on\nreasons are also inclined to accept a sufficient condition of this\nkind, and we will consider one such philosophical reason in the next\nsection. So these may end up being good indirect\narguments against internalism. But no sufficient condition is\npart of internalism by itself, so there are no direct overgeneration\narguments against internalism.\n3.2 For Internalism\n3.2.1 The Significance of Apparent Internal Reasons\n\n\nSo far we have considered extensional arguments against\ninternalism. But there are also extensional arguments in\nfavor of internalist theses. Setting aside peculiarly\nmoral reasons, common sense suggests that ordinary practical\nreasons exhibit a high degree of agent-relativity. It is also\nnatural to think that in at least many cases, different agents have\ndifferent reasons because they want different things. If\nA desires chocolate ice cream, and B desires\nstrawberry ice cream, then intuitively A has a reason to\npurchase the chocolate, and B has a reason to purchase the\nstrawberry. Many have thought that the Humean Theory of Reasons is\nmore than suggested by this sort of extensional data.\n\n\nThe idea behind this reasoning is that if we have to agree that\nsome reasons depend on desires, then we should give serious\nconsideration to the theory according to which all reasons do,\nas being simpler and more explanatory than the theory according to\nwhich some reasons derive from our desires but others do not.\nThis may even provide a promising analytical hypothesis about what\nclaims about reasons mean, or reductive hypothesis about what reasons\nare. This kind of argument is anticipated by Williams\u2019 claim that\nthe issue is whether there are both internal and external reasons, or\ninternal reasons only (1979; see also Schroeder 2007b). We now\ndiscuss three kinds of externalist objection to this argument.\n3.2.2 Three Objections\n\n\nOne line of objection holds that no reasons derive from our\ndesires. It seems plausible that they do only because desire is\nclosely connected to something else, which often is a source\nof reasons: something like pleasure or\nenjoyment (Bond 1983, Millgram 1997, Scanlon 1998).\nReasons that seem to derive from desires can arguably be more plausibly\nexplained by pleasure, which can also serve to explain reasons that\ndesire cannot explain: reasons deriving from pleasures that the\nagent does not actually desire. It may therefore be a better and\nmore explanatory hypothesis that something like pleasure\ngrounds our agent-relative reasons. However proponents of this\nkind of objection often take hedonic states like pleasure to be merely\none instance of something possessing intrinsic value, and\noffer as rivals to HTR theories of reasons as based on intrinsic value\n(see the entry on \n intrinsic vs. extrinsic value).\n\n\n\nIn response, Humeans can observe that in ordinary cases agents\nwant pleasure, and that thereby HTR can accommodate such\nreasons. This line of objection needs a case in which an agent\nhas a reason to do not just something that she does not already desire\nto do, but something that would not serve any desire whatsoever that\nshe already has. Since any given action may serve many different\npossible desires, and agents who do not desire (e.g.) pleasure are rare\nand peculiar, it is difficult to control for these kinds of\nfactors. Externalists can claim that an agent would have a reason\nto do what is pleasurable even in the absence of any such general\ndesire, but this is something that an internalist may be able to deny\nwithout absurdity\u2014although here intuitions seem to differ\nradically.\n\n\nA related objection consists in the complaint that agents can have\ndesires that clearly do not generate any practical reasons because they\nare for worthless objects. Prominent examples in the literature\ninclude a desire to drink a saucer of mud or a can of paint, and a\ndisposition to turn on radios whenever they are off. As noted in\nsection 3.1.3, these examples can\u2019t provide direct counterexamples to\nany sort of reasons internalism, because reasons internalism itself\nplaces only a necessary condition on reasons and not a sufficient\ncondition, and these examples are proposed counterexamples to a\nsufficient condition. But they are highly relevant to the\ntheoretical argument for internalism that is our concern in this\nsection. If we advance as our case for internalism the\nexplanatory power of the thesis that reasons depend on desire or\nmotivation, then it is a significant problem if this relation isn\u2019t\nconsistent and desire or motivation don\u2019t always generate\nreasons. Some explanation of this inconsistency is needed, and\nwhen we find it we may find that it reveals that something other than\ndesire or motivation is the genuine source of our reasons.\n\n\nThese cases are taken to show that desires are only connected with\nreasons if they are also connected with something else, for example\nintrinsic value, and they do not yield reasons otherwise. Against\nthis the internalist can again challenge intuitions and defend the\nconsistency of the connection, by insisting (e.g.) that a desire to\ndrink a saucer of mud is sufficient for having a reason to do so.\nSuch a reason need not be a good or strong one, after all, and the\npeculiarity of claiming that there is such a reason may be explained\naway as being merely pragmatic. In cases in which the reasons for\nan action are dwarfed by the considerations against it, it is usual to\nreport that there is no reason for the action at all; \u2018there is a\nreason to do A\u2019 typically communicates that there is a\nrelatively weighty reason to do A. Whether or not agents\nhave desire-based reasons in these circumstances remains a contested\nissue.\n\n\nA different version of this same sort of objection works by granting\na special connection between reasons and desire but suggesting that\nthis exists because desires involve judgments or perceptions that\nsomething is a reason (e.g. Anscombe 1963, Stampe 1987, Quinn\n1993, Millgram 1997, Scanlon 1998). Scanlon labels these\n\u2018desires in the directed-attention sense\u2019; on this view,\n(apparent) reasons are explanatory of desires, and not the\nreverse. This hypothesis would explain why agents tend to have\nrelevant desires whenever they believe themselves to have\nreasons, but it does not seem well-placed to explain why agents would\nhave these desires whenever they actually have reasons.\nIf we are disposed to ascribe reasons to others in\ncorrespondence with their desires, the Humean hypothesis is better.\n\n\nA third kind of objection (Hampton 1998) insists that though it is\ntrue that some reasons derive from our desires, this is only because of\nmore fundamental reasons which themselves do not derive from our\ndesires. Proponents of this view hold that there is a fundamental\nreason to do what you desire and that changes in what you desire simply\naffect what you need to do in order to go about doing so. This\nview admits that our desires can sometimes affect our reasons but\ninsists that they only do so because there is a further reason, which\ndoes not depend on any desire. Philosophers who accept this view\nare unmoved by the argument that Actual State forms of reason\ninternalism can provide a more unified explanation of reasons.\nThey don\u2019t deny the existence of \u2018internal\u2019 reasons (which\ndo derive from desires), but do hold that internal reasons are simply\nderivative from and hence are explained by a special case of external\nreasons (which do not derive from or depend on desires at all). A\nsimilar dialectic goes for Actual State views which appeal to a more\ngeneral kind of state than \u2018desire\u2019.\n3.3 Relative Explanatory Power\n\n\nAny evaluation of whether Actual State reasons internalism is\nsimpler, more elegant, or explanatorily more powerful than any possible\nexternalist view will have to turn on an evaluation of this kind of\nexternalist explanatory strategy. If internal reasons could be\nsimply derivative from external reasons, and external reasons could be\nindependently explained, then Actual State reasons internalism will\nhave very little traction on these grounds. If the derivation of\ninternal reasons from external reasons turns out to be unsuccessful,\nhowever, or external reasons themselves are difficult to explain, then\nActual State reasons internalism will gain traction as an explanatory\nhypothesis. Schroeder (2007b) attacks the derivation of internal\nreasons from external reasons; here we can go on to consider whether\nexternal reasons are themselves harder to explain than internal\nones.\n\n\nMany philosophers have held that external reasons are, in fact,\nharder to explain than internal ones; even some who were no skeptics\nabout external reasons, like Immanuel Kant (see the entry on\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy.)  \n So what makes external reasons so puzzling? One\nidea is that they are puzzling because they leave so little on the\nbasis of which to explain why they are reasons for the people for whom\nthey are reasons. Internal reasons are shared only by certain\npeople\u2014people with the requisite desires. So Max\u2019s desires\ncan be used to explain why he has the internal reasons that he\nhas. But categorical external reasons like those Kant was\nconcerned about (and which are required in order to reconcile Moral\nRationalism with Moral Absolutism) are supposed to be reasons for any\nagent, no matter what she is like. So the only thing to which we\ncan appeal in order to explain why Max has these reasons is the fact\nthat Max is an agent. Some philosophers have accordingly\ninvested great energy in developing robust enough accounts of agency to\nbe able to explain moral reasons. For example, Christine\nKorsgaard (1996) maintains that reasons derive from the demands of\nautonomy, or being regulated by stable principles that define\nones\u2019 self, which she identifies as a necessary condition for\nacting at all.\n\n\nHowever, even accounts that derive reasons from the nature of agency\nmay ultimately vindicate some form of internalism. David Velleman\n(1996), for example, argues that agency is characterized by a\nparticular higher-order inclination\u2014to \u2018behave in, and out\nof, a knowledge of what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 Although this is a\nkind of desire, it is distinct from the contingent desires that might\nbe satisfied by particular actions and which internalists usually\nidentify as the source of our reasons. Velleman accordingly\ndescribes his view as a \u2018fainthearted externalism\u2019, but it\nremains a form of internalism according to the scheme presented\nhere.\n\n\nSome advocates of various forms of internalism have complained that\nadvocacy of external reasons amounts to nothing more than\n\u2018bluff\u2019 (Williams 1979). A natural way to understand\nthis idea is as the complaint that external reasons theorists leave us\nwith too few constraints on what reasons could be, and hence are able\nto make whatever claims about reasons they want (so long as they\nendorse them in a serious enough tone of voice, perhaps), with no\nindependent way of checking their plausibility. This complaint\ncould be a fair one against externalists who are willing to offer no\ngeneral theory about or constraints on reasons, but it is unfair in\ngeneral. Externalists may simply look for discipline and unity in\ntheir views about reasons from a source distinct from facts about\nmotivation or motivational psychology. Value-based theorists, for\nexample, tie their claims about reasons to commitments about what is\nvaluable. So their claims about what we have reasons to do are\nchecked by the plausibility of the corresponding theses about what is\nvaluable.\n4. The Debate Today\n\n\nThe debate over internal and external reasons is very much alive\ntoday, open on nearly all of the fronts that we have considered in this\narticle. Or more accurately, we should say that the\ndebates over internal and external reasons are very much alive\ntoday. As we saw, there are important differences between State\nand Motivation forms of internalism, between Counterfactual and Actual\nforms of internalism, and between versions that give rise to the\nCentral Problem and those that do not. There are also important\nfurther differences in precisely how to formulate any given version of\nreasons internalism, and we have not precisely formulated any single\nversion in this article.\n\n\nWhat is clear is that there are two main varieties of internalist\nview, each of which faces its own class of problems. Most\ninternalist views encounter the Central Problem, and hence have\ndifficulty in allowing for some of the important reasons that we\npre-theoretically are inclined to think that there are. Though\nother arguments have been offered against them, this challenge is at\nthe heart of their difficulties. We saw that some Counterfactual\nversions of internalism avoid the Central Problem, by claiming that the\nrelevant counterfactuals are not grounded in any features of agents\u2019\nactual psychologies, but rather are explained in some other way.\nThe challenge facing these views is to provide such an explanation\nwithout collapsing into triviality, as with the view that the relevant\ncounterfactual condition is \u2018that the agent is motivated by all\nof her reasons\u2019.\n\n\nExternalist views, on the other hand, avoid the Central Problem and\nhence do well with moral reasons, but critics worry that external\nreasons are more mysterious, and that such theories cannot provide as\nattractive an explanation of why some reasons do\nappear to be internal. An attractive way forward may have to show\nentrenched parties how to achieve some of the important advantages of\neach side of the debate.",
