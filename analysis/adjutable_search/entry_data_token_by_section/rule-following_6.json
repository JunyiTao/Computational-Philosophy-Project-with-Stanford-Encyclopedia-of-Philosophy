    "main_text": "The Sceptical Solution || Non-Factualist Theories\n3.2 Non-Factualist Theories\n\nOne might attempt to avoid eliminativism about meaning by embracing a\ndifferent type of irrealism, namely, non-factualism. A\nnon-factualist about a domain maintains that judgments and claims made\nwithin that domain are not in the business of stating facts. Indeed,\nthe standard view in the secondary literature is that Kripke\u2019s\nWittgenstein himself is proposing a form of semantic non-factualism in\nthe sceptical solution outlined in chapter 3 of Kripke (1982). See,\ne.g., McGinn (1984), Wright (1984), Boghossian (1989), and Hale\n(2017). Might semantic non-factualism afford us a way to embrace the\nconclusion of the sceptical argument while avoiding eliminativism?\n\nThis move faces difficulties parallel to those faced by error theories\n(Boghossian 1989, 1990; Hattiangadi 2007: chapter 4, 2018; Miller\n2011, 2020). The non-factualist about meaning proposes that we\nconstrue ascriptions of meaning as having a purpose or function\ndifferent from that of stating facts. But, insofar as a sentence is\nregarded as having a function, there is an intelligible distinction\nbetween correct and incorrect uses of that sentence; in other words,\nthe sentence is rule-governed. That the notion of correctness in these\ncases cannot be identified with truth or warranted assertibility makes\nno difference to the applicability of a generalised version of the\nextensionality condition, which we outlined in\n section 2.\n Thus, suppose that \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019 is a\nsentence that has a non-descriptive semantic function. Consider these\ntwo specifications of the conditions in which uttering \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019\nis correct, where \\(R_1\\) and\n\\(R_2\\) would confer different correctness-values on utterances of\n\u2018\\(S\\)\u2019:\n\n(a)\n Uttering \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019 is correct\niff the conditions in which it is uttered accord with \\(R_1\\);\n(b)\n Uttering \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019 is correct\niff the conditions in which it is uttered accord with \\(R_2\\).\n\n\nWhatever makes it the case that (a) provides the correctness\nconditions for utterances of \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019\nmust rule out (b) as providing\nthose conditions. \n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the case of plans, which are expressed in\nsentences that wear their non-descriptive semantic function on their\nsleeves. (We choose the case of plans deliberately here, as a view of\nthis kind is mooted in Gibbard 2012.) Take the sentence\n\u2018Let\u2019s write a fugue!\u2019. Consider two possible\ncorrectness conditions for it:\n\n(a*)\n \u2018Let\u2019s write a fugue!\u2019, as uttered by Glenn, is\ncorrect iff Glenn plans to write a fugue\n\n\nand\n\n(b*)\n \u2018Let\u2019s write a fugue!\u2019, as uttered by Glenn, is\ncorrect iff either (a) it is time t earlier than t* and\nGlenn plans to write a fugue or (b) it is time t later than or\nequal to t* and Glenn plans to write a novel.\n\n\nGlenn\u2019s finite nature together with the infinitude of the\ntemporal sequence ensures that the sceptic will always be able to\nargue that no fact about Glenn is capable of ruling in something like\n(a*) and ruling out something like (b*) as the relevant correctness\ncondition. The non-factualist is entitled to regard \u201cLet\u2019s\nwrite a fugue!\u201d as having a determinate meaning only if she can\nprovide some fact about Glenn or his speech community that determines\nthat that sentence is governed by (a*) rather than (b*). The same\nargument can be pressed against the suggestion that \u201cJones means\naddition by \u2018+\u2019\u201d should be regarded as having some\nnon-descriptive semantic function. The non-factualist will be able to\nregard \u201cJones means addition by \u2018+\u2019\u201d as having\na determinate meaning only if she can provide some fact about Jones or\nhis speech community that determines that that sentence is governed by\none rule or correctness condition rather than another.\n\nSo, a non-factualist account of any region of thought and talk, which\nis committed to the claim that there are no facts of the relevant\nsort, would seem to presupposes a realist account of meaning, content\nand rules according to which there are semantic facts, intentional\nfacts, and facts about normative accord. So, a non-factualist account\nof meaning, content and rules, which is committed to the claim that\nthere are no semantic facts, intentional facts, or facts about\nnormative accord that our semantic, intentional, or normative\ndiscourse purports to capture, presupposes a realist account of\nmeaning, content and rules according to which there are semantic\nfacts, intentional facts, and facts about normative accord. It thus\nfaces a charge of incoherence.\n\nAs noted above, we chose \u201cplans\u201d as our stalking horse\nhere in order to make explicit the problem this poses for Allan\nGibbard\u2019s (2012) account of meaning (it makes no difference to\nthe argument whether \u201cplans\u201d are taken to be linguistic\nitems possessing meaning or mental states possessing intentional\ncontent). A Gibbard-style expressivist approach to an area such as\nmorality denies that there are moral facts, but presupposes that there\nare facts about meaning, content and normative accord (facts that\ndetermine what accords and fails to accord with a plan). A\nGibbard-style approach to meaning, content and rules thus, on the one\nhand, denies that there are semantic facts, intentional facts and\nfacts about normative accord (facts that determine what accords and\nfails to accord with a plan), and, on the other, presupposes that\nthere are such facts. It thus faces a charge of incoherence.\n\nA similar objection to Gibbard\u2019s view is outlined in Hattiangadi\n(2018). According to Hattiangadi, a Gibbard-style expressivist account\nof moral claims, for example, aims to give an \u201coblique\u201d\nexplanation of them in terms of the states of mind they express\n(rather than a \u201cstraight\u201d explanation in terms of (moral)\nstates of affairs which potentially render them true). But such an\noblique explanation in the moral case presupposes a straight\nexplanation of intentionality. In parallel, an oblique explanation of\nmeaning and intentionality would presuppose a straight explanation of\nmeaning and intentionality, again threatening the view with\nincoherence. In a reply to Hattiangadi, Gibbard reflects on the\nstrategy of the metaethical expressivist and attempts to use it to\ncounter Hattiangadi\u2019s worry. He writes:\n\n\nA parallel can be found in ethics: Suppose we claim that being good\nconsists in being pleasurable. The concept of being pleasurable can be\ncompletely non-ethical and naturalistic, but the claim \u201cBeing\ngood consists in being pleasurable\u201d is ethical\u2014and so, if\nMoore and others are right, nonnaturalistic. Is there, then, \u201ca\nstraight or substantive explanation of intentionality\u201d? The\ncorrect answer will parallel that for the question, \u201cIs there a\nstraight substantive explanation of being good?\u201d If ethical\nhedonists are right and being good consists in being pleasurable, then\nthere\u2019s a straight, substantive explanation of being good in the\nsense of a naturalistic explanation of the property that being good\nconsists in. But the claim \u201cBeing good is being\npleasurable\u201d isn\u2019t itself naturalistic. If Ayer was right,\nit amounts to \u201cHurrah for all and only what\u201ds pleasurable.\n(Gibbard 2018: 770)\n\n\nWe leave assessment of Gibbard\u2019s reply as an exercise for\n readers.[8]\n\n",
