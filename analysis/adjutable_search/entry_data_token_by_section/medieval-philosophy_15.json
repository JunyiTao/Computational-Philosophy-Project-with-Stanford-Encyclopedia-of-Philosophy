The Importance of Logic\n\nIn the Ancient World, sophisticated systems of logic were developed by\nAristotle and by the Stoics, but, unlike rhetoric, logic was never a\nstandard part of education\n then.[34]\n By contrast, in both the Islamic world and in Latin Europe during the\nMiddle Ages logic became a fundamental discipline, not just within\nphilosophy (as it has been for the last century in the Anglophone\nworld), but for anyone receiving more than the most basic\neducation.\n4.1 Arabic Logic\n\nBy the early tenth century, the whole of Aristotle\u2019s\nOrganon was available in Arabic. It was an extended\nOrganon, which included the Rhetoric and the\nPoetics. Logic was seen as providing the rules for different\nsorts of discourse, of varying levels of intellectual value. At the\nbottom were poetic syllogisms, then rhetoric, then the dialectical\nsyllogisms of the Topics and finally, as the peculiar\npreserve of philosophers, demonstration, the theory set out in the\nPrior Analytics and applied to knowledge in the Posterior\nAnalytics and, so it was thought, according to which Aristotle\nconstructed his entire system of thought. Avicenna did not reject this\noverall view, but he was mainly interested in refashioning\nAristotle\u2019s (demonstrative) syllogistic, even more thoroughly\nthan he reshaped his metaphysics and natural science. He combined\ncategorical and hypothetical syllogistic into a single theory, and he\nvastly complicated Aristotle\u2019s system by introducing temporal\nqualifications into every sort of syllogism (see entry on\n Ibn Sina\u2019s logic).\n Except in Islamic Spain, Avicenna\u2019s logic replaced\nAristotle\u2019s.\n\nFalsafa, however, always remained the pursuit of a small\nminority, at the edges of the world of Islamic education. The position\nof logic was transformed by al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b. Whereas his attitude\nto falsafa was ambiguous, he declared that logic\u2014he had\nin mind Avicenna\u2019s version of Aristotelian syllogistic\u2014was\nuseful, even essential, for the Islamic sciences, such as law, that\noccupied much of the curriculum in the madrasas, which were beginning\nto flourish in his time. Following his lead, logic became a fixed part\nof madrasa education. In the thirteenth century, succinct logical\ntextbooks were written, such as al-Abhar\u012b\u2019s\n\u012as\u0101gh\u016bj\u012b and al-K\u0101tib\u012b\u2019s\nShamsiyya, which were then the subject of many commentaries.\nThe concerns of madrasa logic were formal: developing further\nAvicenna\u2019s path in syllogistic, especially modal syllogistic,\nrelational syllogisms and the Liar Paradox. This tradition was\ncontinued in Iran, Turkey and India, each of these regions\nincreasingly separated from the others, down to the nineteenth\ncentury. (See the entry on\n Arabic and Islamic philosophy of language and logic.)[35]\n4.2 Latin Logic\n\nIn the Latin world, the pattern of education established from c. 800\nin monasteries and cathedral schools\n (\u00a72.2)\n gave logic a central role, in what was the mainstream of higher\neducation, despite very limited access to the ancient\n sources.[36]\n\nAlthough the sophisticated philosophy developed in this context by\nthinkers like Abelard was the preserve of the elite twelfth-century\nParis schools, it had by then become normal for everyone being trained\nintellectually in Latin Europe to learn at least basic Aristotelian\nlogic and the theory of topical inference, as developed in later\nantiquity and transmitted by Boethius. With the founding of the\nuniversities and the expansion of the syllabus to include the whole\nrange of disciplines covered by Aristotle, it might seem that logic\nlost its preeminent position. But it had not, for two reasons. First,\nthe early years of the Arts course were almost entirely devoted to\nlogic, and many students did not remain at university any longer;\nmoreover, they would often have received some instruction in logic\nbefore coming (in their early teens) to university, and there was\nfurther study of logic in the higher faculties of Law and Medicine\n(see Brumberg 2021: 95\u201397). Second, while the influx of new\ntexts made many of the leading thirteenth-century university thinkers\nmore interested in metaphysics, natural science, epistemology and\nethics than in logic, the Oxford thinkers of the 1320s\u2014not just\nOckham, but his fellow Franciscans\n Walter Chatton\n (d. 1343/4) and\n Adam Wodeham\n (d. 1358) and the Dominican\n Robert Holcot/Holkot\n (d. 1349)\u2014made frequent use of sophisticated logical techniques\nin their theological discussions, setting a fashion that would also be\nimitated in Paris (see Courtenay 1987: 171\u2013306).\n\nIn the Arabic tradition, Aristotelian logic was at first studied by\nclose reading of Aristotle\u2019s own texts, but Avicenna then\nreplaced Aristotle as the authority, and then often later textbooks\nreplaced his work\n (\u00a71.1).\n Almost the reverse process took place in the Latin world. From\nconsisting mainly of encyclopaedic accounts, the logical syllabus\nmoved to being constituted of a couple of Aristotle\u2019s works,\nsupplemented by Porphyry and Boethius (the logica vetus) by\nthe eleventh century, and once the rest of the Organon (the\nlogica nova) became available, by the early thirteenth\ncentury, Aristotle\u2019s logic (augmented just by Porphry\u2019s\nIntroduction and a twelfth-century text supplementing the\nCategories) was studied in detail in the universities,\ncontinuing to the sixteenth century, and even later in Spain. This\ntradition of\u00a0commentary, although never abandoning\nAristotle\u2019s text, often resulted in sorting out the difficulties\nin his presentation and reworking his logic (as, for example, in the\ncommentary on the Prior Analytics by\n Robert Kilwardby\n from the 1240s: see Thom\n 2019).[37]\n\nFrom the late twelfth century there also developed in the Latin\ntradition what was called the logica modernorum\n(\u201ccontemporary logic\u201d)\u2014a variety of new branches of\nthe subject not found in Aristotle. The most important of them concern\nthe properties of terms (the analysis of the reference of\nwords\u2014their \u201csupposition\u201d\u2014within the context\nof sentences (see entry on\n Medieval theories: properties of terms);\n consequentiae (propositional logic, by contrast with\nAristotelian term logic\u2014see entry on\n medieval theories of consequence);\n sophismata (deliberately ambiguous sentences and/or ones with\napparently puzzling consequences that can be explained by semantic\nanalysis, such as \u201cSomething white will be black\u201d);\n insolubles\n (insolubilia\u2014paradoxes, such as that of the Liar); and\n obligations\n (an argument game, involving counterfactual statements and testing\nthe contestants\u2019 ability to remain consistent). Specialized\ntreatises were written on each of these topics, but the most popular\ntextbook of all, the Treatise, known as the Summule\nlogicales, written by\n Peter of Spain\n probably c. 1125\u201350, which combines the logica vetus\nand nova with a long exposition of the theory of the property\nof terms. Peter (whoever he was: see Peter of Spain\nSummaries,\u00a01\u20139) was not in fact an outstanding\nlogician, but his work, by then the standard textbook, was adapted,\nwith enormous licence, in the mid-fourteenth century as a vehicle for\nhis also very widely-read Summule de dialectica, by the\ngreatest logician of the time, John Buridan. Work within the\nlogica modernorum went on until the mid-sixteenth\n century.[38]\n4.3 Logic in Byzantium and among the Jews\n\nAlthough logic did not have the same prominent place in Byzantine\neducation as in the Latin schools and universities, or in the\nmadrasas, there was a continuous tradition of its study, based on\nexegesis of the Organon and strongly influenced by the late\nancient School of\n Alexandria.[39]\n\nThere were no outstanding logicians among the Jews in the Islamicate\nworld, but in Christian Europe from the thirteenth century onwards a\nlively tradition of logic grew up. It was based initially on Hebrew\ntranslations of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s short commentaries\nand Averroes\u2019s middle commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nOrganon and the logical part of al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s\nOpinions. But Jewish scholars also became familiar with some\nLatin material, such as Peter of Spain\u2019s Treatise\n(especially the parts on the logica vetus). Gersonides was an\noriginal logician, who wrote widely-studied supercommentaries on\nAverroes\u2019s middle commentaries, where he is often critical of\nAverroes, and a treatise, the Book of the Correct Syllogism,\nremarkable for its degree of formalization (see Manekin 2012).\n5. When Was Medieval Philosophy?\n\nWhereas specialists are mostly agreed, in theory at least, about the\nnew, broad conception of the geography of medieval philosophy, opinion\nabout the period\u2019s chronology remains divided. There is, indeed,\na widespread view (e.g., De Rijk 1985: 1\u201364; Luscombe 1997: 1;\nFlasch 1986 [2000: 27\u201329]; Lagerlund 2020: v) that period\ndivisions are unimportant and are chosen for purely practical reasons\nin order to allow for a division of labour. But, as will emerge below,\nthe choice of period divisions makes a great difference to how the\nhistory of philosophy is written, and arguments can be made from the\ncontinuity and breaks in traditions for different periodizations\n(Marenbon 2011).\n5.1 When Did Medieval Philosophy Begin?\n\nThere are three main points commonly chosen for the beginning of\nmedieval philosophy:\n\nc. 500, a date often chosen by historians for the start of the\nMiddle Ages and corresponding roughly to the end of the Roman Empire\nin the West (the last Emperor was deposed in 476);\nwith the earliest Christian philosophers in the second century\n(but usually omitting the pagan Greek tradition; or\naround 800, because this was the time of both the philosophical\nstirrings at Charlemagne\u2019s court and the start of\nfalsafa in\n Baghdad.[40]\n\n\nThere are problems with each view:\n\nThe justification for c. 500 applies only to Latin philosophy,\nand\nthat for the second century only to Christian philosophy;\nwhile\nignores Greek philosophy and also threatens to leave Latin\nphilosophy between 500 and 800, which historians of classical\nphilosophy disdain, outside consideration.\n\n\nIf the medieval tradition is being envisaged in all four of its main\nbranches, there is some virtue in seeing the point of departure in the\nwork of Plotinus (d. 270) and Porphyry (d. 305?) and including too the\nother Greek pagan material. All four branches are rooted in the\nso-called Platonic Schools, and they took their orientation from these\ntwo philosophers. Of course, historians of ancient philosophy will\nalso want to include some of the thinkers in the earliest centuries of\nthis period in their field, but that is not a problem, because there\nis no reason why periods in the history of philosophy should not\noverlap.\n5.2 When Did Medieval Philosophy End?\n\nMany different answers might be given to this question, but a\nplausible (and to many people surprising) one is: around about 1700,\nexcept that the Arabic tradition, in logic especially, lasted rather\nlonger.\n\nThe Arabic tradition continued, especially in Persia, Turkey and India\nthrough the seventeenth century and, especially in logic (see\n \u00a74.1),\n beyond. The outstanding centre was Safavid Iran, where \u1e62adr\nal-Din Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b (known as\n Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101,\n 1571\u20131636) developed an original system of thought on the basis\nof Avicennian Aristotelianism itself, and as modified by\nSuhraward\u012b, and the mystical ideas of Ibn \u2018Arabi. New\nresearch shows that in the seventeenth century the Ottoman Empire,\ntoo, was the home to innovative philosophizing, sometimes taking the\nearlier Iranian tradition as its starting point (El-Rouayheb\n2015).\n\nThe tradition of Jewish philosophy in Hebrew in Christian Europe\nlargely came to an end with the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in\n1492, though it continued for another century in Turkey (see\nTirosh-Samuelson 1997: 529\u2013545). But Jewish philosophy in Europe\ncontinued with the Dialogues of Love by\n Judah Abrabanel,\n known as Leone Ebreo (d. after 1521), preserved and probably written\nin Italian. If, as proposed below, the Latin tradition of medieval\nphilosophy is considered to stretch on until around 1700, then perhaps\n Spinoza\n (1632\u201377), who wrote in Latin and, rarely, in Dutch, an outcast\nfrom his people and a critical admirer of Descartes, but also steeped\nin the thought of Maimonides and \u1e24asdai Crescas, should be\nregarded as the last of the medieval Jewish philosophers.\n\nThe Byzantine tradition was afflicted by the Fall of Constantinople in\n1453, but theological and philosophical speculation in Greek continued\nunder Turkish rule, strongly linked with the earlier tradition, but\ninfluenced by Latin scholastic thinking in the seventeenth century,\nand by new trends in European thinking in the eighteenth (Podskalsky\n1988).\n\nFixing the end point of the Latin medieval tradition is difficult.\nAlthough the traditional and still widespread date of 1500 is often\ntoday said to have no significance, that year has often been chosen by\ngeneral historians to mark the beginning of modern times, as a round\nfigure near to 1492, the date of Columbus\u2019s first voyage to the\nNew World, and 1517, the beginning of the Reformation, which would\ndestroy the apparent unity of Catholic Europe. Many medieval\nhistorians now, however, do not wish to place a boundary at this time\nand stress the continuities in economic and social life that lasted\nuntil the Industrial Revolution. In any case, there is no reason why\nperiodizations in the history of philosophy should coincide with those\nin other areas.\n\nIn many multi-part or multi-volume presentations, Medieval Philosophy\nis followed by Renaissance Philosophy and then by (Early) Modern\nPhilosophy, beginning with Descartes. \u201cRenaissance\nphilosophers\u201d are identified as usually working outside the\nuniversities; many of them enthusiasts for Plato and other ancient\nphilosophers, as well as, or instead of, Aristotle; many eager to\nwrite elegant classical Latin and to learn Greek, and to use literary\nforms such as the dialogue. There was indeed a group of such\nphilosophers, but they do not fit into a chronology that places\nRenaissance Philosophy after Medieval Philosophy: the most famous of\nthem are Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola\n (\u00a72.8),\n neither of whom survived until\n 1500.[41]\n\nUniversity philosophy continued in its established patterns, with some\nimportant changes (such as dropping study of the Metaphysics)\nin Protestant countries, until late in the seventeenth century. In the\nIberian peninsula, the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were the\nperiod in which philosophical theology, studied in the established\nuniversity manner, flourished (see entry on the\n School of Salamanca).\n The tradition is continuous with the earlier Parisian one, since its\nfounder, Francisco de Vitoria (1486\u20131546) was a pupil of the\nlast of the great Paris University theologians, the Scot John Major\n(1467\u20131550). Among Vitoria\u2019s well-known successors were\nDomingo de Soto (d. 1560), Luis de Molina (d. 1600)\u2014who held\nthat God has a special knowledge of the choices we shall make, but\nthat he does not control these choices, and\n Francisco Su\u00e1rez\n (b. 1548), one of the deepest and most powerful thinkers in the whole\nLatin tradition. One of the few big differences from earlier medieval\nuniversity thinking was the central importance given to Aquinas\n(although Su\u00e1rez was also influenced by Scotus and Ockham),\nwhose Summa Theologiae was now an object of commentary.\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s death in 1617 (more than twenty years\nafter\u00a0Descartes\u2019s birth) does not mark the end of this\nuniversity tradition, but its development into the adventurous\nthought, striking out in new directions in metaphysics and\nmeta-ethics, of until recently forgotten thinkers such as Pedro\nHurtado de Mendoza (d. 1641), his pupil, Rodrigo de Arriaga (d. 1667)\nand Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz (d. 1682).\n\nThe interest of this \u201cbaroque scholasticism\u201d is now\nbeginning to be recognized (see Novotn\u00fd 2009). At the same\ntime, some of the best scholars in the field have written studies that\ndeliberately cut across the usual medieval to modern philosophy\ndivide, looking at metaphysics from 1274 to 1671 (Pasnau 2011) or\ntheories about emotion from 1270 to 1670 (Perler 2011 [2018]). These\napproaches still tend to accept the standard idea that medieval\nphilosophy ended, and modern philosophy began sometime around 1500 or\nat least before 1600, underlining continuities or pleading for the\nexistence of \u201cmedieval philosophy after the Middle\n Ages\u201d.[42]\n A radical suggestion, however, would be to place the ending of\nmedieval Latin philosophy round about 1700 (allowing, of course, for\nan overlap with early modern philosophy), since it was only by then\nthat the effects of the New Science and Cartesianism had worked their\nway into university education and the Aristotelian tradition was\ndisappearing (although by no means everywhere in\n Europe).[43]",
