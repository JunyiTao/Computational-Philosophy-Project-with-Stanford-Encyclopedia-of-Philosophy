In the United States, most\nsurrogacy arrangements are purely domestic affairs (with both the\nintended parents and the surrogate being citizens of the United\nStates), but a significant number are international, in which the\nsurrogate mother is often a citizen of a much poorer country.\n\nBoth types of surrogacy arrangement have been subjected to criticism\non a number of distinct grounds. Some have argued that surrogacy\ninvolves an objectionable form of \u201ccommodification\u201d, while\nothers have argued that the practice is harmful to children, or to\nwomen as a class. But many have also argued that the practice exploits\nthe women who serve as surrogates. In the case of international\nsurrogacy, this charge is usually based on the bad circumstances and\nlow pay of the women who serve as surrogates. The lack of alternative\nsources of employment has been said to undermine women\u2019s\nconsent, and the compensation they receive is often extremely low\ncompared to the pay received by American surrogates for the same\nservice\u2014sometimes as low as 10%.\n\nIn the case of domestic surrogacy, critics charge that surrogate\nmothers are young and do not fully understand the physical and\npsychological risks that attend the services they are agreeing to\nprovide. As a result, the arrangement might be harmful on net to them\ndespite the fact that they consent to it. Or, even if it is not\nharmful on net, the payment they receive might be inadequate\ncompensation for the costs they incur, thus rendering surrogacy a case\nof mutually beneficial but unfair and exploitative exchange (Tong\n1990).\n\nQuestions of fair compensation for surrogates raise many of the same\nissues, and give rise to many of the same debates, as are found in the\nliterature on sweatshop labor (Wilkinson 2003). But unlike the sort of\nlabor that takes place in sweatshops, some critics believe that\ncommercial surrogacy arrangements are intrinsically wrong. If\nwomen\u2019s reproductive labor is not the sort of service that\nshould be sold at any price, then commercial surrogacy may\ninvolve a kind of exploitation insofar as it entices women to engage\nin an activity that is harmful to their moral character (Anderson\n1990; Wertheimer 1996: Ch. 4).\n",
