    "main_text": "A classification of logics\n10. A classification of logics\n\nUnfortunately, not every logic is algebraizable. A typical example of a\nnon-algebraizable logic is the local consequence of the normal modal\nlogic \\(K\\). Let us discuss this example.\n\nThe local modal logic \\(\\blK\\) and the corresponding global one\n\\(\\bgK\\) are not only different, but their metalogical properties\ndiffer. For example, \\(\\blK\\) has the deduction-detachment property\nfor \\(\\rightarrow\\): \n\n\\[\\Gamma \\cup \\{\\phi \\} \\vdash_{\\blK } \\psi\\txtiff \\Gamma \\vdash_{\\blK } \\phi \\rightarrow \\psi.\\]\n\n\nBut \\(\\bgK\\) does not have the deduction-detachment property (at\nall).\n\nThe logic \\(\\bgK\\) is algebraizable and \\(\\blK\\) is not. The\nequivalent algebraic semantics of \\(\\bgK\\) is the variety \\(\\bMA\\) of\nmodal algebras, the set of equivalence formulas is the set \\(\\{p\n\\leftrightarrow q\\}\\) and the set of defining equations is \\(\\{p\n\\approx \\top \\}\\). Interestingly, \\(\\blK\\) and \\(\\bgK\\) have the same\nalgebraic counterpart (i.e., \\(\\bAlg \\blK = \\bAlg \\bgK)\\), namely, the\nvariety of modal algebras.\n\nA lesson to draw from this example is that the algebraic counterpart\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) of a logic \\(\\bL\\) does not necessarily fully encode the\nproperties of \\(\\bL\\). The class of modal algebras encodes the\nproperties of \\(\\bgK\\) because this logic is algebraizable and\ntherefore the link between \\(\\bgK\\) and \\(\\bAlg \\bgK\\) is as strong as\npossible. But \\(\\bAlg \\blK\\), the class of modal algebras, cannot by\nitself completely encode the properties of \\(\\blK\\).\nWhat causes this difference between \\(\\bgK\\) and \\(\\blK\\) is that the class of reduced matrix models of \\(\\bgK\\) is \\[\\{\\langle \\bA, \\{1^{\\bA }\\}\\rangle : \\bA \\in \\bMA\\},\\] but the class of reduced matrix models of \\(\\blK\\) properly includes this class so that for some algebras \\(\\bA \\in \\bMA\\), in addition to \\(\\{1^{\\bA }\\}\\) there is some other \\(\\blK\\)-filter \\(F\\) with \\(\\langle \\bA, F \\rangle\\) reduced. This fact provides a way to show that \\(\\blK\\) can not be algebraizable by showing that the \\(\\blK\\)-filters of the reduced matrices are not equationally definable from the algebras; if they where, then for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg \\blK\\) there would exist exactly one \\(\\blK\\)-filter \\(F\\) of \\(\\bA\\) such that \\(\\langle \\bA, F \\rangle\\) is reduced.\n\nNonetheless, we can perform some of the steps of the Lindenbaum-Tarski\nmethod in the logic \\(\\blK\\). We can define the Leibniz congruence of\nevery \\(\\blK\\)-theory in a uniform way by using formulas in two\nvariables. But in this particular case the set of formulas has to be\ninfinite. Let \\(\\Delta(p, q) = \\{\\Box^n (p \\leftrightarrow q): n\\) a\nnatural number\\(\\}\\), where for every formula \\(\\phi , \\Box^0\\phi\\) is\n\\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\Box^n\\phi\\) for \\(n \\gt 0\\) is the formula \\(\\phi\\)\nwith a sequence of \\(n\\) boxes in front \\((\\Box\n\\ldots \\Box \\phi)\\). Then, for every \\(\\blK\\)-theory \\(T\\)\nthe relation \\(\\theta(T)\\) defined by\n\n\\[\\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle \\in \\theta(T)\\txtiff \\{\\Box^n (\\phi \\leftrightarrow \\psi): n \\textrm{ a natural number}\\} \\subseteq T\\]\n\n\nis the Leibniz congruence of \\(T\\). In this case, it\nhappens though that there are two different \\(\\blK\\)-theories with the\nsame Leibniz congruence, something that does not hold for\n\\(\\bgK\\).\nThe logics \\(\\bL\\) with the property that there is a set of formulas (possibly infinite) \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in two variables that defines in every \\(\\bL\\)-theory \\(T\\) its Leibniz congruence, that is, that for all \\(L\\)-formulas \\(\\phi , \\psi\\) it holds \\[\\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle \\in \\bOmega_{\\bFm }(T)\\txtiff \\Delta(\\phi , \\psi) \\subseteq T,\\] are known as the equivalential logics. If \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) is finite, the logic is said to be finitely equivalential. A set \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) that defines in every \\(\\bL\\)-theory its Leibniz congruence is called a set of equivalence formulas for \\(\\bL\\). It is clear that every algebraizable logic is equivalential and that every finitely algebraizable logic is finitely equivalential.\n\nThe logic \\(\\blK\\) is, according to the definition, equivalential, and\nit can be shown that it is not finitely equivalential. The local modal\nlogic lS4 is an example of a non-algebraizable logic\nthat is finitely equivalential. A set of equivalence formulas for\nlS4 is \\(\\{\\Box(p\\leftrightarrow q)\\}\\).\n\nA set of equivalence formulas for a logic \\(\\bL\\) should be considered\nas a generalized biconditional, in the sense that collectively the\nformulas in the set have the relevant properties of the biconditional,\nfor example in classical logic, that makes it suitable to define the\nLeibniz congruences of its theories. This comes out very clearly from\nthe following syntactic characterization of the sets of equivalence\nformulas.\n\nTheorem 6.\n\nA set \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) of \\(L\\)-formulas is a set of\nequivalence formulas for a logic \\(\\bL\\) if and only if\n\n\n\\((\\tR_{\\Delta})\\)\n\\(\\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(p, p)\\)\n\\((\\tMP_{\\Delta})\\)\n\\(p, \\Delta(p, q) \\vdash_{\\bL } q\\)\n\\((\\tS_{\\Delta})\\)\n \\(\\Delta(p, q) \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(q, p)\\)\n\\((\\tT_{\\Delta})\\)\n\\(\\Delta(p, q) \\cup \\Delta(q, r) \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(p,\nr)\\)\n\\((\\tRe_{\\Delta})\\)\n\\(\\Delta(p_1, q_1) \\cup \\ldots \\cup \\Delta(p_n, q_n) \\vdash_{\\bL }\n\\Delta(* p_1 \\ldots p_n, * q_1 \\ldots q_n)\\), for every connective\n\\(*\\) of \\(L\\) of arity \\(n\\) greater that 0.\n\n\n\nThere is some redundancy in the theorem. Conditions \\((\\tS_{\\Delta})\\)\nand \\((\\tT_{\\Delta})\\) follow from \\((\\tR_{\\Delta}),(\\tMP_{\\Delta})\\)\nand \\((\\tRe_{\\Delta})\\).\n\nEquivalential logics were first considered as a class of logics\ndeserving to be studied in Prucnal & Wro\u0144ski 1974, and they\nwere studied extensively in Czelakowski 1981; see also Czelakowski\n2001.\n\nWe already mentioned that the algebraizable logics are equivalential.\nThe difference between an equivalential logic and an algebraizable one\ncan be seen in the following syntactic characterization of\nalgebraizable logics:\n\nTheorem 7.\n\n\nA logic \\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable if and only if there exists a set \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) of \\(L\\)-formulas and a set \\(\\iEq(p)\\) of \\(L\\)-equations such that the conditions \\((\\tR_{\\Delta})\\)\u2013\\((\\tRe_{\\Delta})\\) above hold for \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) and \\[p \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(\\iEq(p)) \\textrm{ and } \\Delta(\\iEq(p)) \\vdash_{\\bL } p.\\]\n\nThe set \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in the theorem is then an equivalence set of\nformulas for \\(\\bL\\) and the set \\(\\iEq(p)\\) a set of defining\nequations.\n\nThere are logics that are not equivalential but have the property of\nhaving a set of formulas \\([p \\Rightarrow q]\\) which collectively\nbehave in a very weak sense as the implication \\(\\rightarrow\\) does in\nmany logics. Namely, that has the properties \\((\\tR_{\\Delta})\\) and\n\\((\\tMP_{\\Delta})\\) in the syntactic characterization of a set of\nequivalence formulas, i.e.,\n\n\\((\\tR_{\\Rightarrow})\\) \n\\(\\vdash_{\\bL } [p \\Rightarrow p]\\)\n\\((\\tMP_{\\Rightarrow})\\)\n\\(p, [p \\Rightarrow q] \\vdash_{\\bL } q\\)\n\n\nIf a logic is finitary and has a set of formulas with these\nproperties, there is always a finite subset with the same properties.\nThe logics with a set of formulas (finite or not) with properties\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n above are called protoalgebraic. Thus, every equivalential\nlogic and every algebraizable logic are protoalgebraic.\n\nProtoalgebraic logics were first studied by Czelakowski, who called\nthem non-pathological, and  slightly later by Blok and Pigozzi in\nBlok & Pigozzi 1986. The label \u2018protoalgebraic logic\u2019\nis due to these last two authors.\n\nThe class of protoalgebraic logics turned out to be the class of\nlogics for which the theory of logical matrices works really well in\nthe sense that many results of universal algebra have counterparts for\nthe classes of reduced matrix models of these logics and many methods\nof universal algebra can be adapted to its study; consequently the\nalgebraic study of protoalgebraic logics using their matrix semantics\nhas been extensively and very fruitfully pursued. But, as we will see,\nsome interesting logics are not protoalgebraic.\n\nAn important characterization of protoalgebraic logics is via the\nbehavior of the Leibniz operator. The following conditions are\nequivalent:\n\n\\(\\bL\\) is protoalgebraic.\nThe Leibniz operator \\(\\bOmega_{\\bFm_L}\\) is monotone on the set\nof \\(\\bL\\)-theories with respect to the inclusion relation, that is,\nif \\(T \\subseteq T'\\) are \\(\\bL\\)-theories, then \\(\\bOmega_{\\bFm_L\n}(T) \\subseteq \\bOmega_{\\bFm_L }(T')\\).\nFor every algebra \\(\\bA\\), the Leibniz operator \\(\\bOmega_{\\bA}\\)\nis monotone on the set of \\(\\bL\\)-filters of \\(\\bA\\) with respect to\nthe inclusion relation.\n\n\nDue to the monotonicity property of the Leibniz operator, for every\nprotoalgebraic logic \\(\\bL\\) the class of algebras \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is\nclosed under subdirect products and therefore it is equal to\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\). Hence, for protoalgebraic logics the two ways we\nencountered to associate a class of algebras with a logic produce, as\nwe already mentioned, the same result.\n\nThere are also characterizations of equivalential and finitely\nequivalential logics by the behavior of the Leibniz operator. The\nreader is referred to Czelakowski 2001 and Font & Jansana &\nPigozzi 2003.\n\nIn his Raftery 2006b, Raftery studies Condition 7 in the list of\nproperties of an algebraizable logic we gave just after the\ndefinition. The condition says:\n\n\nFor every \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg^*\\bL\\) the class of reduced matrix models of\n\\(\\bL\\) is \\(\\{\\langle \\bA, \\iEq(\\bA) \\rangle : \\bA \\in\n\\bAlg^*\\bL\\}\\), where \\(\\iEq(p)\\) is the set of defining equations for\n\\(\\bL\\).\n\n\nThe logics with a set of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) with this property,\nnamely such that for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg^*\\bL\\) the class of reduced\nmatrix models of \\(\\bL\\) is \\(\\{\\langle \\bA, \\iEq(\\bA) \\rangle : \\bA\n\\in \\bAlg^*\\bL\\}\\), are called truth-equational, a name\nintroduced in Raftery 2006b. Some truth-equational logics are\nprotoalgebraic but others are not. We will see later an example of the\nlast ones.\n\nThe protoalgebraic logics that are truth-equational are in fact the\nweakly algebraizable logics studied already in Czelakowski\n& Jansana 2000. Every algebraizable logic is weakly algebraizable.\nIn fact, the algebraizable logics are the equivalential logics that\nare truth-equational. But not every weakly algebraizable logic is\nequivalential. An example is the  logic determined by the\northolattices, namely by the class of the matrices \\(\\langle \\bA, \\{1\\}\n\\rangle\\) where \\(\\bA\\) is an ortholattice and 1 is its greatest\nelement (see Czelakowski & Jansana 2000 and Malinowski 1990).\n\nThe classes of logics we have considered so far are the main classes\nin what has come to be known as the Leibniz hierarchy because\nits members are classes of logics that can be characterized by the\nbehavior of the Leibniz operator. We described only the most important\nclasses of logics in the hierarchy. The reader is referred to\nCzelakowski 2001, Font, Jansana & Pigozzi 2003, Font 2016 and\n2022, for more information. In particular, Czelakowski 2001 gathers\nextensively the information on the different classes of the Leibniz\nhierarchy known at the time of its publication and Font 2016 is an\nintroduction to abstract algebraic logic very well suited to learn the\nmost important facts about the Leibniz hierarchy and of abstract\nalgebraic logic in general. \n\nThe relations between the classes of the Leibniz hierarchy considered\nin this entry are summarized in the following diagram:\n\n\n\nFigure. The Leibniz Hierarchy\n\n\nRecently, the Leibniz hierarchy has been refined in Cintula &\nNoguera 2010, 2016. The idea is to consider instead of a set of\nequivalence formulas \\(\\Delta\\) (that corresponds to the biconditional)\na set of formulas \\([p\\Rightarrow q]\\) that has several properties of the\nusual conditional \\((\\rightarrow)\\). Among these properties we have \\((\\tR_{\\Rightarrow})\\) and\n\\((\\tMP_{\\Rightarrow})\\) in the definition of protoalgebraic logic. The set \\([p\\Rightarrow q]\\) should be such that its symetrization \\([p\\Rightarrow q]\n\\cup[q\\Rightarrow p]\\) is a set of equivalence formulas. New classes\narise when the set \\([p\\Rightarrow q]\\) has a single element.\nExtensive information can be found in the recent book Cintula &\nNoguera 2021. This book can also be taken as an introduction to\nabstract algebraic logic written from the perspective of the\nimplication. \n",
