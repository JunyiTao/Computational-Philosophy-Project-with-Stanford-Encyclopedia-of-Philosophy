    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works\n1.2 Works\n\nDiogenes Laertius (IX 55 = 80A1 DK) attributes many works to\nProtagoras, but a comparison with other sources reveals that his list\nis incomplete. Still worse, what is missing from Diogenes\u2019 list\nare precisely the most important and controversial works, such as\nTruth and On the Gods. One possible explanation is\nthat these two texts constituted individual sections of the\nAntilogiae (Opposing Arguments, mentioned by\nDiogenes), which were possibly known also as Kataballontes\nlogoi (The Overthrower Arguments or, better, The\nKnockdown Arguments; in M VII 60 Sextus Empiricus\nattributes to this text the \u201cMan measure\u201d sentence, which\nother sources refer to Truth; see Decleva Caizzi 1999: 317;\nLee 2005: 24\u201329). Intriguing as it is, the hypothesis is\ndifficult to prove. The title suggests that the Antilogiai\nwere structured upon some sort of oppositions (an interesting parallel\nare the Dissoi logoi); but there is no indication of\noppositions in the surviving fragments from Truth and On\nthe Gods. Again, any attempt at reconstruction is destined to\nremain speculative, given the dearth of available fragments. Other\ntitles such as The Art of Eristic, On Wrestling,\nOn Sciences, On Love of Honours, On the\nConstitution show the breadth of Protagoras\u2019 interests.\n\nApart from these titles, unfortunately, all we have are a few (less\nthan ten in Diels-Kranz\u2019s edition) authentic fragments and many\ninterpretations. Ever since Antiquity, his provocative theses have\nelicited interest and criticism from his readers. As a result,\ndifferent reconstructions of his thought are available, which are not\nalways reliable and are often clearly shaped by disparaging\nintentions. The first and most important tradition stretches back to\nPlato, who devoted two dialogues to the theses of the sophist of\nAbdera, the Protagoras and the Theaetetus. Many of\nthe later testimonies, starting with Aristotle\u2019s, would appear\nto depend on Plato\u2019s discussions, and this must be taken into\naccount when examining the information from our sources. Alongside the\nPlatonic, another tradition proved rather influential in Antiquity,\nnamely the one that highlighted the sceptical implications of\nProtagoras\u2019 thought (the most interesting testimony, not in DK,\ncomes from the Commentary on the Psalms by Didymus the Blind,\nsee PToura V 222.18-29; this testimony, absent in DK, can be read in\nthe recent edition by Laks and Most 2016, vol. VIII.1, 109\u2013111).\nHowever, little is known about this interpretation because sceptics\nsuch as Sextus Empiricus explicitly refused to be associated with\nProtagoras, whom they regarded as a dogmatist. This kind of reading\ncertainly served polemical purposes. Another tradition that was\nhostile to Protagoras, and which was possibly connected to the\nsceptical interpretation, was the Epicurean one, which is responsible\nfor the emphasis on the link between Protagoras and Democritus, on the\nground of their epistemologies\u2014in all likelihood, an unfounded\nidea. All in all, we must note that many\u2014if not all\u2014the\ntestimonies we have about Protagoras are vitiated by underlying\npolemical attitudes of some sort, which in some cases lead to actual\ndistortions of his thought.\n",
