    "main_text": "Causation || Causal Loops\n3.2 Causal Loops\nBackwards time travel would apparently allow for the possibility of\ncausal loops, in which things come from nowhere. The things in\nquestion might be objects\u2014imagine a time traveller who steals a\ntime machine from the local museum in order to make his time trip and\nthen donates the time machine to the same museum at the end of the\ntrip (i.e. in the past). In this case the machine itself is never\nbuilt by anyone\u2014it simply exists. The things in question might\nbe information\u2014imagine a time traveller who explains the theory\nbehind time travel to her younger self: theory that she herself knows\nonly because it was explained to her in her youth by her time\ntravelling older self. The things in question might be\nactions. Imagine a time traveller who visits his younger self. When he\nencounters his younger self, he suddenly has a vivid memory of being\npunched on the nose by a strange visitor. He realises that this is\nthat very encounter\u2014and resignedly proceeds to punch his younger\nself. Why did he do it? Because he knew that it would happen and so\nfelt that he had to do it\u2014but he only knew it would happen\nbecause he in fact did\n it.[20]\n\n\nOne might think that causal loops are impossible\u2014and hence that\ninsofar as backwards time travel entails such loops, it too is\nimpossible.[21]\nThere are two issues to consider here. First, does backwards time\ntravel entail causal loops? Lewis (1976, 148) raises the question\nwhether there must be causal loops whenever there is backwards\ncausation; in response to the question, he says simply \u201cI am not\nsure.\u201d Mellor (1998, 131) appears to claim a positive answer to\nthe question.[22]\n Hanley (2004, 130) defends a negative\nanswer by telling a time travel story in which there is backwards time\ntravel and backwards causation, but no causal\nloops.[23]\nMonton (2009) criticises Hanley\u2019s counterexample, but also\ndefends a negative answer via different counterexamples.\n\n\nSecond, are causal loops impossible, or in some other way\nobjectionable? One objection is that causal loops\nare inexplicable. There have been two main kinds of response\nto this objection. One is to agree but deny that this is a\nproblem. Lewis (1976, 149) accepts that a loop (as a whole) would be\ninexplicable\u2014but thinks that this inexplicability (like that of\nthe Big Bang or the decay of a tritium atom) is merely strange, not\nimpossible. In a similar vein, Meyer (2012, 263) argues that if\nsomeone asked for an explanation of a loop (as a whole), \u201cthe\nblame would fall on the person asking the question, not on our\ninability to answer it.\u201d The second kind of response (Hanley,\n2004, \u00a75) is to deny that (all) causal loops are inexplicable. A\nsecond objection to causal loops, due to Mellor (1998, ch.12), is that\nin such loops the chances of events would fail to be related to their\nfrequencies in accordance with the law of large numbers. Berkovitz\n(2001) and Dowe (2001) both argue that Mellor\u2019s objection fails\nto establish the impossibility of causal\nloops.[24]\n",
