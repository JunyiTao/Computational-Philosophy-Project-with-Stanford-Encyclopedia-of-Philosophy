    "main_text": "Epistemology || Anti-Expertise\n4.1 Anti-Expertise\n\n\n To be an\n anti-expert\n about a topic is to be reliably wrong about that topic. Egan and Elga\n(2005) distinguish being unreliable, as when a compass does not point\nnorth when facing north, from being anti-reliable, as when a compass\npoints south when facing north. They also give the example of\ndirections while driving: When someone is an anti-expert about\ndirections, whenever they think they should go left they should really\ngo right and whenever they think they should go right, they should\nreally go left.\n\n\nSorensen (1988) argues that one\u2019s own anti-expertise is a\nblindspot; it is a true proposition that one cannot rationally accept.\nHe argues that one cannot rationally believe that their own beliefs are\nfalse since the anti-expert\u2019s belief in something counts as\nevidence against believing it. Egan and Elga (2005) also argue that one\ncannot rationally believe oneself to be an anti-expert. So in the\ndriving case, they say that one should withhold belief about which way\nto go.\n\n\nBut suppose that whenever the person withholds, it turns out they\nshould go left. In this case, withholding does not escape the problem.\nLike modesty, there are special issues with self-ascription; one can\naccept that others are anti-experts with no problems, but\nself-ascription seems self-undermining. In this sense, it can be seen\nas a limit on epistemic modesty\u2014rationality prohibits one from\nthinking that their own faculties are anti-reliable. So, in the more\ndifficult directions example, Sorensen (1987, 308ff.) claims one cannot\nrationally believe that one is in such a situation. Gilbert (1971)\nmakes a similar claim in the moral domain, arguing that there are\nrational limits on the self-ascription of moral vices.\n\n\nOthers have argued that it is possible to self-ascribe\nanti-expertise. Conee (1987) does this by suggesting that one can\nbelieve the premises of a valid argument but not its conclusion and\nRichter (1990) claims that one can believe general claims without\nbelieving particular instances of it. Bommarito (2010) highlights cases\nwhere the most rational option for non-ideal agents is to self-ascribe\nanti-expertise.\n",
