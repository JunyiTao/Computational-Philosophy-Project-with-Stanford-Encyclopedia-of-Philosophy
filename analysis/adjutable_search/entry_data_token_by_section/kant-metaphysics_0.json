Preliminary Remarks: The Rejection of Ontology (general metaphysics) and the Transcendental Analytic\n\nDespite the fact that Kant devotes an entirely new section of the\nCritique to the branches of special metaphysics, his\ncriticisms reiterate some of the claims already defended in both the\nTranscendental Aesthetic and the Transcendental Analytic. Indeed, two\ncentral teachings from these earlier portions of the Critique\n\u2014 the transcendental ideality of space and time, and the\ncritical limitation of all application of the concepts of the\nunderstanding to \u201cappearances\u201d \u2014 already carry with\nthem Kant\u2019s rejection of \u201contology (metaphysica\ngeneralis).\u201d Accordingly, in the Transcendental Analytic\nKant argues against any attempt to acquire knowledge of \u201cobjects\nin general\u201d through the formal concepts and principles of the\nunderstanding, taken by themselves alone. In this connection, Kant\ndenies that the principles or rules of either general logic (e.g., the\nprinciple of contradiction), or those of his own \u201ctranscendental\nlogic\u201d (the pure concepts of the understanding) by\nthemselves yield knowledge of objects. These claims follow from\nKant\u2019s well-known \u201ckind distinction\u201d between the\nunderstanding and sensibility, together with the view that knowledge\nrequires the cooperation of both faculties. This position, articulated\nthroughout the Analytic, entails that independently of their\napplication to intuitions, the concepts and principles of the\nunderstanding are mere forms of thought which cannot yield knowledge\nof objects.\n\nFor if no intuition could be given corresponding to the concept, the\nconcept would still be a thought, so far as its form is concerned, but\nwould be without any object, and no knowledge of anything would be\npossible by means of it. So far as I could know, there would be\nnothing, and could be nothing, to which my thought could be applied.\nB146\n\n\nWe thus find one general complaint about efforts to acquire\nmetaphysical knowledge: the use of formal concepts and principles, in\nabstraction from the sensible conditions under which objects can be\ngiven, cannot yield knowledge. Hence, the \u201ctranscendental\u201d\nuse of the understanding (its use independently of the conditions of\nsensibility) is considered by Kant to be dialectical, to involve\nerroneous applications of concepts in order to acquire knowledge of\nthings independently of sensibility/experience. Throughout the\nAnalytic Kant elaborates on this general view, noting that the\ntranscendental employment of the understanding, which aims towards\nknowledge of things independently of experience (and thus knowledge of\n\u201cnoumena\u201d), is illicit (cf. A246/B303). It is in this\nconnection that Kant states, famously, in the Analytic, that\n\u201c\u2026the proud name of ontology, which presumes to offer\nsynthetic a priori cognitions of things in general\u2026\nmust give way to the more modest title of a transcendental\nanalytic\u201d (cf. A247/B304). Filling this out, Kant suggests that\nto take ourselves to have unmediated intellectual access to objects\n(to have \u201cnon-sensible\u201d knowledge) correlates with the\nassumption that there are non-sensible objects that we can know. To\nassume this, however, is to conflate \u201cphenomena\u201d (or\nappearances) with \u201cnoumena\u201d (or things in themselves). The\nfailure to draw the distinction between appearances and things in\nthemselves is the hallmark of all those pernicious systems of thought\nthat stand under the title of \u201ctranscendental realism.\u201d\nKant\u2019s transcendental idealism is the remedy for these.\n",
