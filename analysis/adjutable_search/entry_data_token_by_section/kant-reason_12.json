    "main_text": "The unity of theoretical and practical reason || The public use of reason\n3.3 The public use of reason\n\nAnyone concerned with Kantian reason and politics must consider his\nfamous essay, \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d (1784). Among many\ndiscussions, see O\u2019Neill 1989: Ch. 2, 1990 & 2015: Ch. 3;\nVelkley 1989; Deligiorgi 2005; Patrone 2008.\n\nAs we have seen, Kant\u2019s first maxim of reason is to think for\noneself. He says this is the way to achieve \u201cliberation from\nsuperstition,\u201d and equates this with \u201cenlightenment\u201d\n(5:294). His second maxim asks us to \u201cthink into the place of\nothers.\u201d Communication is essential for this. As he writes:\n\u201c\u2026how much and how correctly would we think if we did not\ncommunicate with others to whom we communicate our thoughts, and who\ncommunicate theirs with\n us!\u201d[32]\n\nIn \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d Kant places both maxims in a\npolitical context. He demands that we \u201chave the courage to use\nour own reason\u201d:\n\nEnlightenment is the human being\u2019s emergence from his\nself-incurred immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use\none\u2019s own understanding [=\n reason[33]]\n without the guidance of another. This immaturity is\nself-incurred if its cause is not lack of understanding, but\nlack of resolution and courage to use it without the guidance of\nanother. Sapere aude! [Dare to be wise!] Have courage to make\nuse of your own understanding [= reason]! is thus the motto\nof enlightenment. (8:35)\n\n\nKant\u2019s main concern is not with individuals, however.\nEnlightenment is a collective endeavor. It therefore has cultural and\npolitical aspects. For enlightenment, Kant says, \u201cnothing is\nrequired but\u2026 the least harmful\u2026 freedom: namely,\nfreedom to make public use of one\u2019s reason in all\nmatters\u201d (8:36).\n\nThis \u201cleast harmful freedom\u201d is not the freedom to act\npolitically. It is not even freedom of speech in the now-familiar\nsense that covers many forms of personal expression. Instead, it is\nthe freedom to reason \u201cas a scholar before the entire\npublic of the world of readers\u201d (8:37).\n\nAs we might expect, Kant contrasts public reasoning with private\nreasoning. However, the distinction has an unfamiliar meaning. For\nKant, employees reason privately. He mentions civil servants, military\nofficers, or clerics in an established church. In contemporary terms,\nthese are all more or less \u201cpublic\u201d roles. However, these\nemployees are bound by the policies, procedures and dictates of their\norganization. They reason about how to act\u2014but only to judge the\nbest way of fulfilling tasks laid down by their employers.\n\nWe can draw a parallel with an individual who reasons\ninstrumentally\u2014about the best way to satisfy their inclinations,\nfor example. Instrumental reason decides the best means to achieve\npre-given ends. In Kant\u2019s terms, it is\nheteronomous\u2014directed by a source outside reason itself.\n\nSimilarly, these employees are directed by state or church. Their\noffices may be \u201cpublic,\u201d but their reasoning is\nprivate\u2014deprived of full publicity. The employee\n\u201ccarries out another\u2019s commission\u201d (8:38). His\nreasoning is not free: it is \u201cimpermissible to argue; instead,\none must obey\u201d (8:37). The employee does not abandon his own\nmoral judgment\u2014Kant is careful to add that he must resign if he\ncould not \u201cin conscience [continue to] hold his office\u201d\n(8:38). But within that office, he acts as a \u201cpassive\nmember\u201d (8:37) of the commonwealth.\n\nBy contrast, the public use of reason is active and autonomous. It\ndoes not follow directions; it is accountable to all. When a person\nreasons publicly, he thinks for himself and speaks as a member of\n\u201cthe society of citizens of the world\u201d (8:37). Outside of\nhis post, an employee may reason freely, and may even criticize\ngovernment policies or religious teachings.\n\nThe same applies to the ordinary citizen. He must obey\u2014for\nexample, by paying taxes\u2014and may not speak in a way that\nencourages others to disobey. But he \u201cdoes not act against the\nduty of a citizen when, as a scholar, he publicly expresses his\nthoughts about the inappropriateness or even injustice of\n[governmental] decrees\u201d (8:38).\n\nThis creates a stark contrast between roles: the obedient citizen or\nemployee, as opposed to the \u201cscholar\u201d who makes\n\u201cpublic use of reason.\u201d But Kant sees no inconsistency.\nPeaceful co-existence requires that citizens do not undermine, let\nalone rebel against, existing governments\u2014that risks chaos and\neven civil war. In Kant\u2019s words, \u201cmorally practical reason\npronounces [an] irresistible veto: there is to be no\nwar\u201d (6:354). As citizens of a given state, we must act as\npolitical institutions demand. As citizens of the world, however, we\nmay criticize those demands and advocate\n reform.[34]\n\nKant\u2019s views invite criticism. In his day, only a few citizens\ncould read and publish their views; hardly any women could. So his\nposition may seem elitist and sexist. It implies a gulf between theory\nand practice\u2014between what employees and citizens may believe\nought to be done, and what they must do (\u201cobey\u201d!).\n\u201cThe least harmful freedom\u201d may seem not just harmless but\npowerless. Freedom to publish is only a small part of the freedoms\nessential to modern democracy. Hence Kant\u2019s views may seem\nantiquated. Certainly, they fall far short of democratic citizenship\nas we understand it.\n Kant\u2019s social and political philosophy\n (\u00a74 and \u00a76) discusses these issues.\n\nFor this entry, the key point is this. Kant equates reason with full\npublicity. \u201cTo use one\u2019s own reason\u201d is to make a\nsincere attempt to address all \u201ccitizens of the\nworld.\u201d Judgments and principles are only reasonable to\nthe extent that they can be accepted by all. Our actions must respect\nexisting boundaries and governments, because the duty to pursue and\nmaintain peace is categorical. But reason itself aspires to\nuniversality. So as citizens of the world, we have another categorical\nduty: to see ourselves as accountable to every human being, and hence\nto improve existing institutions so that they recognize the claims of\nall. For reasoning to be fully public, citizens and\nnon-citizens, rulers and ruled must discuss as equals\u2014despite\ntheir inequalities in practice.\n\nA famous passage from the Critique of Pure Reason expresses\nthis idea, linking reason, critique, and autonomy:\n\nReason must subject itself to critique in all its undertakings, and\ncannot restrict the freedom of critique through any prohibition\nwithout damaging itself and drawing upon itself a disadvantageous\nsuspicion. For there is nothing so important because of its utility,\nnothing so holy, that it may be exempted from this searching review\nand inspection, which knows no respect for persons [i.e. no person\nbears more authority than any other\u2014GW]. On this freedom rests\nthe very existence of reason, which has no dictatorial authority, but\nwhose claim is never anything more than the agreement of free\ncitizens, each of whom must be able to express his reservations,\nindeed even his veto, without holding back. (A738f/B766f, translation\nmodified)\n\n\nIn the term used by several contemporary Kantians, this procedure\nconstitutes reason. (See Herman 2007: Ch. 10, Korsgaard 2008,\nReath 2013, Bagnoli 2017; M\u00f8ller 2020 focuses on Kant\u2019s\nlegal metaphors.) Reason is the only unconditional (that is,\nnon-heteronomous) authority for thinking and acting.\n",
