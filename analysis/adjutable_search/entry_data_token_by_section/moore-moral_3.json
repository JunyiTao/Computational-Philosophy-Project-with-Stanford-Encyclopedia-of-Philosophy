    "main_text": "The Ideal\n4. The Ideal\n\nOne of this chapter\u2019s larger aims was to defend value-pluralism,\nthe view that there are many ultimate goods. Moore thought one bar to\nthis view is the naturalistic fallacy. He assumed, plausibly, that\nphilosophers who treat goodness as identical to some natural property\nwill usually make this a simple property, such as just pleasure or\njust evolutionary fitness, rather than a disjunctive property such as\npleasure-or-evolutionary-fitness-or-knowledge. But then any naturalist\nview pushes us toward value-monism, or toward the view that only one\nkind of state is good (1903: 20; 1993: 72). Once we reject naturalism,\nhowever, we can see what Moore thought is self-evident: that there are\nirreducibly many goods. Another bar to value-pluralism is excessive\ndemands for unity or system in ethics. Sidgwick had used such demands\nto argue that only pleasure can be good, since no theory with a\nplurality of ultimate values can justify a determinate scheme for\nweighing them against each other (1907: 406). But Moore, agreeing here\nwith Rashdall, Ross, and others, said that \u201cto search for\n\u2018unity\u2019 and \u2018system,\u2019 at the expense of truth,\nis not, I take it, the proper business of philosophy\u201d (1903:\n222/1993: 270). If intuition reveals a plurality of ultimate goods, an\nadequate theory must recognize that plurality.\n\nAccording to a famous part of Principia Ethica, one of those\ngoods is the existence of beauty. Arguing against Sidgwick\u2019s\nview that all goods must be states of consciousness (1907:\n113\u201315), Moore asked readers to imagine a beautiful world with\nno minds in it: is this world\u2019s existence not better than that\nof a horribly ugly world (1903: 83\u201385/1993: 135\u201336)? In\nanswering yes, he anticipated some strands in present-day\nenvironmental ethics, which likewise hold that there can be value in\nfeatures of the natural environment apart from any awareness of them.\nBut he did not insist on this view. Later in Principia Ethica\nhe said that beauty on its own at most has little and may have no\nvalue (1903: 202, 203/1993: 250, 251), and in Ethics he\nimplicitly denied that beauty on its own has value. There he held, as\nSidgwick had, that all intrinsic goods involve some state of\nconsciousness and perhaps even of pleasure (1912: 239\u201341,\n249/1947: 147\u201349, 153/1965: 103\u201304, 107). But his first\nbook had defended the contrary view.\n\nMoore also gave some weight to the hedonic states of pleasure and\npain. He thought the former a very minor good, saying pleasure on its\nown at most has limited and may have no value, but he thought pain a\nvery great evil, which there is a serious duty to prevent (1903:\n212\u201313, 222\u201323/1993: 260\u201361, 270\u201371) His view\ntherefore involved a value-asymmetry, with pain a much greater evil\nthan pleasure is a good. This had not been the traditional view; most\nhedonists had held that a pleasure of a given intensity is exactly as\ngood as a pain of the same intensity is evil (e.g. Sidgwick 1907:\n413). But Moore thought it intuitively compelling that the pain is\nworse; if that makes the theory of value less systematic, so much the\nworse for system.\n\nWhile many ideal consequentialists have treated knowledge as\nintrinsically good, in some cases supremely so, Principia\nEthica did not, saying knowledge is a necessary component of the\nlarger good of appreciating existing beauty but has little or no value\nin itself (1903: 199/1993: 248). Again Ethics may have\nreversed this view, citing knowledge several times as one ideal good\nthat may be added to the hedonists\u2019 good of pleasure (1912: 237,\n247/1947 146, 152/1965: 102, 106). But Moore never saw any intrinsic\nvalue in achievement, for example in business or politics, or indeed\nin any active changing of the world. As John Maynard Keynes said, his\nchief goods were states of mind that \u201cwere not associated with\naction or achievement or with consequence. They consisted in timeless,\npassionate states of contemplation and communion, largely unattached\nto \u2018before and after\u2019\u201d (Keynes 1949: 83).\n\nThe first of these goods was the appreciation of beauty, which for\nMoore combined the cognition of beautiful qualities with an\nappropriately positive emotion toward them, such as enjoyment or\nadmiration. We listen to music, for example, hear beautiful qualities\nin it, and are pleased by or admire those qualities. But the value\nhere is entirely contemplative; Moore saw no separate worth in what\nthe romantics had especially valued, the active creation of beauty. He\nmight say that an artist must understand and love his work\u2019s\nbeauty if he is to create it, perhaps even more than someone who\nmerely enjoys it, but the value in his work is still not distinctively\ncreative. In characterizing this good Moore gave a further reductive\nanalysis, this time of beauty as \u201cthat of which the admiring\ncontemplation is good in itself\u201d (1903: 201\u201302/1993:\n249\u201350). Beauty too, then, was not a distinct normative concept\nbut analyzable in terms of goodness. He did not notice, however, that\nthis definition seems again to open him to an open-question argument,\nsince it reduces the claim that it is good to contemplate beauty to\nthe near-tautology that it is good to contemplate what it is good to\ncontemplate.\n\nThough Moore in Principia Ethica thought beauty good in\nitself, he did not insist on this view when valuing the appreciation\nof beauty; the latter might be good even if the former was not. But he\nstill thought the existence of beauty makes a significant difference\nto value. More specifically, he thought the admiring contemplation of\nbeauty that actually exists and causes your contemplation is\nsignificantly better than an otherwise similar contemplation of merely\nimagined beauty, and better by more than can be attributed to the\nexistence of the beauty on its own. This view involved an application\nof his \u201cprinciple of organic unities,\u201d which is one of his\nmain contributions and says the value of a whole need not equal the\nsum of the values its parts would have on their own (1903:\n27\u201329/1993: 78\u201380). If state x on its own has\nvalue a and state y on its own has value b,\nthe whole combining them by relation R need not have value\na + b; it may have more and it may have less. This\nprinciple had been accepted by Idealists such as Bradley, who gave it\na characteristically anti-theoretical formulation. They held that if\nx and y combine to form the whole x-R-y,\ntheir values, like their very identities, are dissolved in that larger\nwhole, whose value cannot be computed from the values of its parts. It\nwas Moore\u2019s contribution to accept the principle in a way that\nrejected this anti-theoretical interpretation and allowed computation,\nthough exactly how it did so depended on his strict view that\nintrinsic value can depend only on intrinsic properties.\n\nThis view implies that when x and y enter into the\nrelation R that constitute the whole x-R-y, their\nown values cannot be changed by those relations. Moore recognized\nthis, saying, \u201cThe part of a valuable whole retains exactly the\nsame value when it is, as when it is not, a part of that whole\u201d\n(1903: 30/1993: 81). Any additional value in the whole x-R-y\nmust therefore be attributed to it as an entity distinct from its\nparts, and with the relations between those parts internal to it.\nMoore called this additional value the value of a whole \u201cas a\nwhole,\u201d and said it needed to be added to the value in the parts\nto arrive at the whole\u2019s value \u201con the whole\u201d (1903:\n214\u201316/1993: 263\u201364). Thus, if x and y\nhave values a and b on their own, and x-R-y\nhas value c \u201cas a whole,\u201d the value of\nx-R-y \u201con the whole\u201d is a + b +\nc. (The value of the whole is therefore not equal to the sum\nof the values of its parts, but is equal to a sum of which those\nvalues are constituents.) This \u201cholistic\u201d formulation of\nthe principle of organic unities is not the only possible one. We\ncould relax the conditions on intrinsic value so it can be affected by\nexternal relations and say that when x and y enter\ninto a whole their own values change, so that, say, x\u2019s\nvalue becomes a + c. This \u201cvariability\u201d\nformulation can always reach the same final conclusions as the\nholistic one, since whatever positive or negative value the latter\nfinds in the whole as a whole the former can add to one or other of\nthe parts. But the two formulations locate the additional value in\ndifferent places, and sometimes one and sometimes the other gives what\nseems the intuitively better explanation of an organic value (Hurka\n1998). Moore, however, was forced by his strict view of intrinsic\ngoodness to use only the holistic formulation. In the aesthetic case,\nhe held that the admiring contemplation of beauty considered apart\nfrom the existence of its object always has the same (moderate) value\na, while the existence of beauty always has the same\n(minimal) value b. But when the two are combined so a person\nadmiringly contemplates beauty that exists and causes his\ncontemplation, the resulting whole has the significant additional\nvalue c as a whole. The existence of the beauty is therefore\nnecessary for the significant value c, but that value is not\nintrinsic to it, belonging instead to the larger whole of which it is\npart.\n\nMoore made several other uses of the principle of organic unities,\nincluding in response to an argument of Sidgwick\u2019s for hedonism.\nSidgwick had claimed that there would be no value in a world without\nconsciousness and, more specifically, pleasure, and had concluded that\npleasure must therefore be the only good (1907: 113, 399\u2013401).\nGiven Principia Ethica\u2019s view about the value of\nbeauty, Moore there rejected the premise of Sidgwick\u2019s argument,\nbut he also argued that, even granting this premise, Sidgwick\u2019s\nconclusion does not follow. It may be that pleasure is a necessary\ncondition for any value, but that once pleasure is present, other\nstates such as the awareness of beauty or personal love increase the\nvalue of the resulting whole even though alone they have no worth\n(1903: 92\u201394/1993: 144\u201345; also 1912: 240\u201346/1947:\n148\u201351/1965: 103\u201306). And of course this was precisely his\nlater view. Another application of the principle was in explicating\nclaims about desert. Moore endorsed the retributive view that when a\nperson is morally vicious it is good if he is punished, and he\nexpressed this view by saying that although the person\u2019s vice is\nbad and his suffering pain is bad, the combination of vice and pain in\nthe same life is good as a whole, and sufficiently so to make the\nsituation on the whole better than if there were vice and no pain\n(1903: 214\u201315/1993: 263\u201364). This is in fact a point where\nMoore\u2019s holistic formulation of the principle is positively\nappealing. The alternative variability view must say that when a\nperson is vicious, his suffering pain switches from being purely bad\nto being purely good. But this implies that the morally appropriate\nresponse to deserved suffering is simply positive, for example simple\njoy, which does not seem right; the better response mixes satisfaction\nthat justice is being done with sorrow at the infliction of pain, as\nMoore\u2019s holistic view implies.\n\nMoore\u2019s other chief good of personal love also involved admiring\ncontemplation, but now of objects, namely persons, that are not just\nbeautiful but also intrinsically good (1903: 203/1993: 251). Since for\nMoore the main intrinsic goods were mental qualities, such love\ninvolved primarily the admiring contemplation of another\u2019s good\nstates of mind. In so characterizing love Moore was applying one of\nfour recursive principles he used to generate higher-level intrinsic\ngoods and evils from an initial base-set of goods and evils. The first\nprinciple says that if state x is intrinsically good,\nadmiringly contemplating, or loving, x for itself is also\nintrinsically good (1903: 203\u201304, 217/1993: 251\u201353, 265).\nThus, if person A\u2019s admiringly contemplating beauty is\ngood, person B\u2019s admiringly contemplating\nA\u2019s admiration is a further good, as is\nC\u2019s admiration of B\u2019s admiration, and so\non. A second principle says that if x is intrinsically evil,\nhating x for itself is intrinsically good (1903: 217/1993\n265); thus, B\u2019s feeling compassionate pain at\nA\u2019s pain is good. And two final principles say that\nloving for itself what is evil, as in sadistic pleasure in\nanother\u2019s pain, and hating for itself what is good, as in\nenvious pain at his pleasure, are evil (1903: 208\u201310,\n211\u201312/1993: 257\u201358, 259\u201360). Though Moore stated\nthese four principles separately, they all make morally appropriate\nattitudes to intrinsic goods and evils, ones whose orientation matches\ntheir objects\u2019 values, additional such goods and morally\ninappropriate attitudes additional evils. The principles were by no\nmeans unique to him; they had been defended earlier by Rashdall and\nBrentano and would be defended later by Ross. But Moore\u2019s\nformulation was in two respects distinctive. Rashdall and Ross called\nthe higher-level values they generated virtues and vices, as it is\nindeed plausible to do; surely benevolence and compassion are virtuous\nand sadism vicious. But Moore preferred to define the virtues\ninstrumentally, as traits that cause goods and prevent evils, and said\nthat as such they lack intrinsic worth (1903: 172\u201377/1993:\n220\u201326). Rashdall and especially Ross also held that virtue is\nthe greatest intrinsic good and vice the greatest evil. In contrast,\nMoore suggested that the value of an appropriate or inappropriate\nattitude is often less than the value of its object; thus compassion\nfor another\u2019s pain, though good, is not as good as the pain is\nevil, so the combination of one person\u2019s pain and\nanother\u2019s compassion for it has on balance negative value.\n\u201cWe have no reason,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto maintain the\nparadox that an ideal world would be one in which vice and suffering\nmust exist in order that it may contain the goods consisting in the\nappropriate emotion towards them. \u2026 we cannot admit the actual\nvalidity of any of the arguments commonly used in Theodicies; no such\nargument succeeds in justifying the fact that there does exist even\nthe smallest of the many evils which this world contains\u201d (1903:\n220/1993: 268)\n\nThe recursive principles are clearly relevant to personal love, whose\ncore involves positive concern for another\u2019s good. But\nMoore\u2019s particular application of the principles led to a\ncuriously restricted picture of what love is. First, as in the\naesthetic case, he took the main valuable attitude to be\ncontemplative, involving the admiration of another\u2019s already\nexisting good qualities rather than any active engagement with them.\nThis applied even to the love of another\u2019s physical beauty.\nThough he thought this a central part of love (1903:\n203\u201304/1993: 252), he took it to involve mere passive admiration\nof another\u2019s beauty, as it were from the other side of the room.\nThere was no desire to possess or interact physically with the\nother\u2019s beauty, that is, no active eroticism; he actually held\nthat sexual arousal, and especially arousal by another\u2019s\narousal, involves love of the ugly or evil and so is evil (1903:\n209\u201310/1993: 257\u201358). The same point applied more\ngenerally: the loving attitude was one of appreciating goods in\nanother\u2019s life rather than of acting to produce or to help her\nachieve them. One did not do anything for or with a loved one; one\nsimply admired her. (In an 1899 paper presented to the Apostles\nsociety at Cambridge he had said, \u201cLove of others is a thing of\nvery great value, and it may be very strong although it does not lead\nto any action. There is, indeed, no reason why it should\u201d\n(quoted in Levy 1979: 203).Though he presented personal love as an\nadditional good to aesthetic appreciation, he characterized it in an\nessentially aesthetic way. Moreover, his list of the goods one is to\nappreciate or comment in a loved one was also truncated. It did not\ninclude pleasure or happiness, since that was not a significant good,\nnor even knowledge or achievement. Instead, it centered on the\nother\u2019s admiring contemplation of beauty (1903: 204/1993:\n252\u201353), as if the supreme expression of love were \u201cWhat\nexcellent taste in pictures you have.\u201d Finally, he took the\nqualities one appreciates in a loved one to be simply and therefore\nimpartially good. This meant his account had no room for the special\nattachment to or heightened concern for an individual that many take\nto be central to personal love. If I love a friend for qualities\nx, y, and z, and a new person comes along\nwith the same qualities to a slightly higher degree, then, on\nMoore\u2019s theory, I should admire the new person\u2019s qualities\nmore and therefore love them more; I should trade up to a better\nbeloved. This is at odds with the loyalty, or attachment to\nindividuals, that many think essential to love. This is not to say\nthat a more adequate account of love cannot be constructed with the\nsame basic structure as Moore\u2019s; it can. It will hold that\npersonal love involves a wider range of positive attitudes, including\nactively promoting as well as contemplating, to a wider range of\ngoods, including happiness, knowledge, and achievement, where those\ngoods in a loved one\u2019s life have greater value from a\nlover\u2019s point of view than do the similar states of strangers,\nwhich makes loving them more appropriate and therefore intrinsically\nbetter. But Moore was prevented from giving this account by other\nfeatures of his view, such as his general emphasis on contemplative\nforms of love, his restricted list of initial goods, and his strict\nimpartialism about value.\n",
