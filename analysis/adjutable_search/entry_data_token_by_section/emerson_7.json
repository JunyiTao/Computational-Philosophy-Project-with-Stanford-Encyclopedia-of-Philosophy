    "main_text": "Emerson on Slavery and Race\n3. Emerson on Slavery and Race\n\nMassachusetts ended slavery in 1783, when Chief Justice William\nCushing instructed the jury in the case of Quock Walker, a former\nslave, that \u201cthe idea of slavery\u201d was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the\nMassachusetts Constitution\u2019 guarantee that \u201call men are born free and\nequal\u201d (Gougeon, 71). Emerson first encountered slavery when he\nwent south for his health in the winter of 1827, when he was 23. He\nrecorded the following scene in his journal from his time in\nTallahasse, Florida: \n\n\nA fortnight since I attended a meeting of the Bible Society. The\nTreasurer of this institution is Marshal of the district & by a\nsomewhat unfortunate arrangement had appointed a special meeting of\nthe Society & a Slave Auction at the same time & place, one\nbeing in the Government house & the other in the adjoining yard.\nOne ear therefore heard the glad tidings of great joy whilst the other\nwas regaled with \u201cGoing gentlemen, Going!\u201d And almost without changing\nour position we might aid in sending the scriptures into Africa or bid\nfor \u201cfour children without the mother who had been kidnapped\ntherefrom\u201d (JMN3: 117).\n\n\nEmerson never questioned the iniquity of slavery, though it was not a\nmain item on his intellectual agenda until the eighteen forties. He\nrefers to abolition in the \u201cProspects\u201d chapter of Nature when\nhe speaks of the \u201cgleams of a better light\u201d in the darkness of history\nand gives as examples \u201cthe abolition of the Slave-trade,\u201d \u201cthe history\nof Jesus Christ,\u201d and \u201cthe wisdom of children\u201d (CW1:43). He condemns\nslavery in some of his greatest essays, \u201cSelf-Reliance\u201d (1841), so\nthat even if we didn\u2019t have the anti-slavery addresses of the 1840s\nand 1850s, we would still have evidence both of the existence of\nslavery and of Emerson\u2019s opposition to it. He praises \u201cthe bountiful\ncause of Abolition,\u201d although he laments that the cause had been\ntaken over by \u201cangry bigots.\u201d Later in the essay he\ntreats abolition as one of the great causes and movements of\nworld history, along with Christianity, the Reformation, and\nMethodism. In a well-known statement he writes that an \u201cinstitution is\nthe shadow of one man,\u201d giving as examples \u201cthe Reformation, of\nLuther; Quakerism, of Fox; Methodism, of Wesley; Abolition of\nClarkson\u201d (CW2: 35). The unfamiliar name in this list is that of\nThomas Clarkson (1760\u20131846), a Cambridge-educated clergyman who helped\nfound the British Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade.\nClarkson travelled on horseback throughout Britain, interviewing\nsailors who worked on slaving ships, and exhibiting such tools as\nmanacles, thumbscews, branding irons, and other tools of the trade.\nHis  History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment\nof the Abolition of the African Slave Trade by the British\nParliament (1808) would be a major source for Emerson\u2019s\nanti-slavery addresses.\n\nSlavery also appears in \u201cPolitics,\u201d from the Essays, Second\nSeries of 1844, when Emerson surveys the two main American\nparties. One, standing for free trade, wide suffrage, and the access\nof the young and poor to wealth and power, has the \u201cbest cause\u201d but\nthe least attractive leaders; while the other has the most\ncultivated and able leaders, but is \u201cmerely defensive of property.\u201d\nThis conservative party, moreover, \u201cvindicates no right, it aspires to\nno real good, it brands no crime, it proposes no generous policy, it\ndoes  not build nor write, nor cherish the arts, nor foster\nreligion, nor establish schools, nor encourage science, nor emancipate\nthe slave, nor befriend the poor, or the Indian, or the immigrant\u201d\n(CW3: 124). Emerson stands here for emancipation, not simply for the\nending of the slave trade.\n\n1844 was also the year of Emerson\u2019s breakout anti-slavery address,\nwhich he gave at the annual celebration of the abolition of slavery in\nthe British West Indies. In the background was the American war with\nMexico, the annexation of Texas, and the likelihood that it would be\nentering the Union as a slave state. Although Concord was a hotbed of\nabolitionism compared to Boston, there were many conservatives in the\ntown. No church allowed Emerson to speak on the subject, and when the\ncourthouse was secured for the talk, the sexton refused to ring\nthe church bell to announce it, a task the young Henry David Thoreau\ntook upon himself to perform (Gougeon, 75). In his address, Emerson\ndevelops a critique of the language we use to speak about, or to avoid\nspeaking about, black slavery:\n\n\nLanguage must be raked, the secrets of slaughter-houses and infamous\nholes that cannot front the day, must be ransacked, to tell what\nnegro-slavery has been. These men, our benefactors, as they are\nproducers of corn and wine, of coffee, of tobacco, of cotton, of\nsugar, of rum, and brandy, gentle and joyous themselves, and producers\nof comfort and luxury for the civilized world.\u2026 I am heart-sick\nwhen I read how they came there, and how they are kept there. Their\ncase was left out of the mind and out of the heart of their\nbrothers (Emerson\u2019s Antislavery Writings, 9).\n\n\nEmerson\u2019s long address is both clear-eyed about the evils of slavery\nand hopeful about the possibilities of the Africans. Speaking\nwith the black abolitionist Frederick Douglass beside him on the\ndais, Emerson states: \u201cThe black man carries in his bosom an\nindispensable element of a new and coming civilization.\u201d He praises\n\u201csuch men as\u201d Toussaint [L]Ouverture, leader of the Haitian slave\nrebellion, and announces: \u201chere is the anti-slave: here\nis man; and if you have man, black or white is an\ninsignificance.\u201d (Wirzrbicki, 95; Emerson\u2019s Antislavery\nWritings, 31). \n\nThe Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 effectively nationalized slavery,\nrequiring officials and citizens of the free states to assist in\nreturning escaped slaves to their owners. Emerson\u2019s 1851 \u201cAddress to\nthe Citizens of Concord\u201d  calls both for the abrogation of the\nlaw and for disobeying it while it is still current. In 1854, the\nescaped slave Anthony Burns was shipped back to Virginia by order of\nthe Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court, an order carried\nout by U. S. Marines, in accordance with the new law. This\nexample of \u201cSlavery in Massachusetts\u201d (as Henry Thoreau put it in a\nwell-known address) is in the background of Emerson\u2019s 1855 \u201cLecture on\nSlavery,\u201d where he calls the  recognition of slavery by the\noriginal 1787 Constitution a \u201ccrime.\u201d Emerson gave these and other\nantislavery addresses multiple times in various places from\nthe late 1840s till the beginning of the Civil War. On\nthe eve of the war Emerson supported John Brown, the violent\nabolitionist who was executed in 1859 by the U. S. government after he\nattacked the U. S. armory in Harper\u2019s Ferry, West Virginia.  In\nthe middle of the War, Emerson raised funds for black regiments of\nUnion soldiers (Wirzbicki, 251\u20132) and read his \u201cBoston Hymn\u201d to\nan audience of 3000 celebrating President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s\nEmancipation Proclamation of 1863. \u201cPay ransom to the owner,\u201d Emerson\nwrote, \u201cand fill the bag to the brim. Who is the owner? The slave is\nowner. And ever was. Pay him\u201d (CW9: 383).\n\nEmerson\u2019s magisterial essay \u201cFate,\u201d published in The Conduct of\nLife (1860) is distinguished not only by its attempt to reconcile\nfreedom and necessity, but by disturbing pronouncements about fate and\nrace, for example: \n\n\nThe population of the world is a conditional population, not the best,\nbut the best that could live now; and the scale of tribes, and the\nsteadiness with which victory adheres to one tribe, and defeat to\nanother, is as uniform as the superposition of strata. We know in\nhistory what weight belongs to race. We see the English, French, and\nGermans planting themselves on every shore and market of America and\nAustralia, and monopolizing the commerce of these countries. We like\nthe nervous and victorious habit of our own branch of the family. We\nfollow the step of the Jew, of the Indian, of the Negro. We see how\nmuch will has been expended to extinguish the Jew, in vain.\u2026 The\nGerman and Irish millions, like the Negro, have a great deal of guano\nin their destiny. They are ferried over the Atlantic, and carted over\nAmerica, to ditch and to drudge, to make corn cheap, and then to lie\ndown prematurely to make a spot of green grass on the prairie (CW6:\n8\u20139).\n\n\nThe references to race here show the influence of a new \u201cscientific\u201d\ninterest in both England and America in the role that race\u2014often\nconflated with culture or nation\u2014plays in human evolution. In\nAmerica, this interest was entangled with the institution of slavery,\nthe encounters with Native American tribes, and with the notion of\n\u201cAnglo-Saxon liberties\u201d that came to prominence during the American\nRevolution, and developed into the idea that there was an Anglo-Saxon\nrace (see Horsman).\n\nEmerson would not be Emerson, however, if he did not conduct a\ncritique of his terms, and \u201crace\u201d is a case in point. He takes it up in\na non-American context, however: in the essay \u201cRace\u201d from English\nTraits (1856). Emerson\u2019s critique of his title begins in the\nessay\u2019s first paragraph when he writes that \u201ceach variety shades down\nimperceptibly into the next, and you cannot draw the line where a race\nbegins or ends.\u201d Civilization \u201ceats away the old traits,\u201d he\ncontinues, and religions construct new forms of character that\ncut against old racial divisions. More deeply still, he\nidentifies considerations that \u201cthreaten to undermine\u201d the concept of\nrace. The \u201cfixity \u2026 of races as we see them,\u201d he writes, \u201cis a weak\nargument for the eternity of these frail boundaries, since all our\nhistorical period is a point\u201d in the long duration of nature (CW\n5:24). The patterns we see today aren\u2019t pure anyway:\n\n\nthough we flatter the self-love of men and nations by the legend of\npure races, all our experience is of the gradation and resolution of\nraces, and strange resemblances meet us every where, It need not\npuzzle us that Malay and Papuan, Celt and Roman, Saxon and Tartar\nshould mix, when we see the rudiments of tiger and baboon in our human\nform, and know that the barriers of races are not so firm, but that\nsome spray sprinkles us from the antidiluvian seas.\n\n\nAs in Nature and his great early works, Emerson asserts our\nintimate relations with the natural world, from the oceans to the\nanimals. Why, one might think, should one of the higher but still\ninitial forms be singled out for separation, abasement, and slavery?\nEmerson works out his views in \u201cRace\u201d without referring to\nAmerican slavery, however, in a book about England where he sees a\nhealthy mixture, not a pure race. England\u2019s history, he writes,\nis not so much \u201cone of certain tribes of Saxons, Jutes, or\nFrisians, coming from one place, and genetically identical, as it is\nan anthology of temperaments out of them all.\u2026 The English\nderive their pedigree from such a range of nationalities.\u2026 The\nScandinavians in her race still hear in every age the murmurs of their\nmother, the ocean; the Briton in the blood hugs the homestead\nstill\u201d (CW5: 28). Still, it is striking that Emerson never\nmentions slavery in either \u201cFate\u201d or \u201cRace,\u201d\nboth of which were written during his intense period of public\nopposition to American slavery.\n",
