    "main_text": "Types, Degrees, and Relatives of Belief || Belief and Knowledge\n2.5 Belief and Knowledge\n\nThe traditional analysis of knowledge, brought into contemporary\ndiscussion (and famously criticized) by Gettier (1963), takes\npropositional knowledge to be a species of belief\u2014specifically,\njustified true belief. Most contemporary treatments of knowledge are\nmodifications or qualifications of the traditional analysis and\nconsequently also treat knowledge as a species of belief. (For a\ndetailed treatment of this topic see the entry on the\n analysis of knowledge.\n For critique of the view that propositional knowledge entails belief,\nsee Radford 1966; Murray, Sytsma, and Livengood 2013; Myers-Schulz and\nSchwitzgebel 2013).\n\nThere may also be types of knowledge that are not types of belief,\nthough they have received less attention from epistemologists. Ryle\n(1949), for example, emphasizes the distinction between knowing\nhow to do something (e.g., ride a bicycle) and knowing\nthat some particular proposition is true (e.g., that Seoul is\nthe capital of Korea). In contemporary psychology, a similar\ndistinction is sometimes drawn between procedural and\ndeclarative knowledge (see Squire 1987; Schacter, Wagner, and\nBuckner 2000; also the entry on\n memory).\n Although knowledge-that or declarative knowledge may plausibly be a\nkind of belief, it is not easy to see how procedural knowledge or\nknowledge-how could be so, unless one holds that people have a myriad\nof beliefs about minute and non-obvious procedural details. At least,\nthere is no readily apparent relation between knowledge-how and\n\u201cbelief-how\u201d that runs parallel to the relation\nepistemologists generally accept between knowledge-that and\nbelief-that. (For an influential attempt to subsume knowledge-how\nunder knowledge-that, see Stanley and Williamson 2001; Stanley\n2011.)\n",
