    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Determinism || Experience\n3.2 Experience\n\nDeterminism could perhaps also receive direct\nsupport\u2014confirmation in the sense of probability-raising, not\nproof\u2014from experience and experiment. For theories (i.e.,\npotential laws of nature) of the sort we are used to in physics, it is\ntypically the case that if they are deterministic, then to the extent\nthat one can perfectly isolate a system and repeatedly impose\nidentical starting conditions, the subsequent behavior of the systems\nshould also be identical. And in broad terms, this is the case in many\ndomains we are familiar with. Your computer starts up every time you\nturn it on, and (if you have not changed any files, have no anti-virus\nsoftware, re-set the date to the same time before shutting down, and\nso on \u2026) always in exactly the same way, with the same speed\nand resulting state (until the hard drive fails). The light comes on\nexactly 32 \u00b5sec after the switch closes (until the day\nthe bulb fails). These cases of repeated, reliable behavior obviously\nrequire some serious ceteris paribus clauses, are never\nperfectly identical, and always subject to catastrophic failure at\nsome point. But we tend to think that for the small deviations,\nprobably there are explanations for them in terms of\ndifferent starting conditions or failed isolation, and for the\ncatastrophic failures, definitely there are explanations in\nterms of different conditions.\n\nThere have even been studies of paradigmatically \u201cchancy\u201d\nphenomena such as coin-flipping, which show that if starting\nconditions can be precisely controlled and outside\ninterferences excluded, identical behavior results (see Diaconis,\nHolmes & Montgomery 2007). Most of these bits of evidence for\ndeterminism no longer seem to cut much ice, however, because of faith\nin quantum mechanics and its indeterminism. Indeterminist physicists\nand philosophers are ready to acknowledge that macroscopic\nrepeatability is usually obtainable, where phenomena are so\nlarge-scale that quantum stochasticity gets washed out. But they would\nmaintain that this repeatability is not to be found in experiments at\nthe microscopic level, and also that at least some failures\nof repeatability (in your hard drive, or coin-flipping experiments)\nare genuinely due to quantum indeterminism, not just failures to\nisolate properly or establish identical initial conditions.\n\nIf quantum theories were unquestionably indeterministic, and\ndeterministic theories guaranteed repeatability of a strong form,\nthere could conceivably be further experimental input on the question\nof determinism\u2019s truth or falsity. Unfortunately, the existence\nof\n Bohmian quantum theories\n casts strong doubt on the former point, while chaos theory\ncasts strong doubt on the latter. More will be said about each of\nthese complications below.\n",
