    "main_text": "Specific Theories of Consciousness || Quantum theories\n9.8 Quantum theories\n\n\nOther physical theories have gone beyond the neural and placed the\nnatural locus of consciousness at a far more fundamental level, in\nparticular at the micro-physical level of quantum phenomena. According\nto such theories, the nature and basis of consciousness can not be\nadequately understood within the framework of classical physics but\nmust be sought within the alternative picture of physical reality\nprovided by quantum mechanics. The proponents of the quantum\nconsciousness approach regard the radically alternative and often\ncounterintuitive nature of quantum physics as just what is needed to\novercome the supposed explanatory obstacles that confront more standard\nattempts to bridge the psycho-physical gap.\n\n\nAgain there are a wide range of specific theories and models that\nhave been proposed, appealing to a variety of quantum phenomena to\nexplain a diversity of features of consciousness. It would be\nimpossible to catalog them here or even explain in any substantial way\nthe key features of quantum mechanics to which they appeal. However, a\nbrief selective survey may provide a sense, however partial and\nobscure, of the options that have been proposed.\n\n\nThe physicist Roger Penrose (1989, 1994) and the anesthesiologist\nStuart Hameroff (1998) have championed a model according to which\nconsciousness arises through quantum effects occurring within\nsubcellular structures internal to neurons known as\nmicrotubules. The model posits so called \u201cobjective\ncollapses\u201d which involve the quantum system moving from a\nsuperposition of multiple possible states to a single definite state,\nbut without the intervention of an observer or measurement as in most\nquantum mechanical models. According to the Penrose and Hameroff, the\nenvironment internal to the microtubules is especially suitable for\nsuch objective collapses, and the resulting self-collapses produce a\ncoherent flow regulating neuronal activity and making non-algorithmic\nmental processes possible.\n\n\nThe psychiatrist Ian Marshall has offered a model that aims to\nexplain the coherent unity of consciousness by appeal to the production\nwithin the brain of a physical state akin to that of a\nBose-Einstein condensate. The latter is a quantum phenomenon in\nwhich a collection of atoms acts as a single coherent entity and the\ndistinction between discrete atoms is lost. While brain states are not\nliterally examples of Bose-Einstein condensates, reasons have been\noffered to show why brains are likely to give rise to states that are\ncapable of exhibiting a similar coherence (Marshall and Zohar\n1990).\n\n\nA basis for consciousness has also been sought in\nthe holistic nature of quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of\nentanglement, according to which particles that have\ninteracted continue to have their natures depend upon each other even\nafter their separation. Unsurprisingly these models have been targeted\nespecially at explaining the coherence of consciousness, but they have\nalso been invoked as a more general challenge to the atomistic\nconception of traditional physics according to which the properties of\nwholes are to be explained by appeal to the properties of their parts\nplus their mode of combination, a method of explanation that might be\nregarded as unsuccessful to date in explaining consciousness\n(Silberstein 1998, 2001).\n\n\nOthers have taken quantum mechanics to indicate that consciousness\nis an absolutely fundamental property of physical reality, one that\nneeds to be brought in at the very most basic level (Stapp 1993). They\nhave appealed especially to the role of the observer in the collapse of\nthe wave function, i.e., the collapse of quantum reality from a\nsuperposition of possible states to a single definite state when a\nmeasurement is made. Such models may or may not embrace a form of\nquasi-idealism, in which the very existence of physical reality depends\nupon its being consciously observed.\n\n\nThere are many other quantum models of consciousness to be found in\nthe literature\u2014some advocating a radically revisionist\nmetaphysics and others not\u2014but these four provide a reasonable,\nthough partial, sample of the alternatives.\n",
