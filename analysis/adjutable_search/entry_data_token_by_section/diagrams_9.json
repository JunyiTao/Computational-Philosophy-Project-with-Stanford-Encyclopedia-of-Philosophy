    "main_text": "Consequences of Spatial Properties of Diagrams || Efficacy of diagrams\n3.2 Efficacy of diagrams\n\nAs discussed above, much of the interest in diagrams has been\ngenerated by the claim that they are somehow more\n\u201ceffective\u201d than traditional logical representations for\ncertain types of task. Certainly, for example, a map is a greater aid\nto navigation than a verbal description of a landscape. However, while\nthere are certainly psychological advantages to be gained through the\nuse of diagrams, they are (as in the case of Euler Circles) often\nineffective as representations of abstract objects and relationships.\nOnce a purely intuitive notion, non-psychological claims about\n\u201cefficacy\u201d of diagrammatic systems can be examined in\nterms of standard formal properties of languages (Lemon et al.\n 1999).\n In particular, many diagrammatic systems are self-consistent,\nincorrect, and incomplete, and complexity of inference with the\ndiagrams is NP-hard. By way of contrast, most sentential logics, while\nable to express inconsistencies, are complete and\n correct[8]\n .\n\nOn the other hand, not being able to represent contradictions could\nprovide us with interesting insights about the nature of diagrammatic\nrepresentation. If a central goal of a language is to represent the\nworld or a state of affairs, then representing contradictions or\ntautologies is called into question. Neither contradictions nor\ntautologies are part of the world. How can we draw a picture, or take\na picture, of the contradiction that \u201cit is raining and it is\nnot raining\u201d? How about the picture of the disjunctive\ninformation \u201cit is either raining or not raining\u201d? Now, we\nseem to be much closer to Wittgenstein\u2019s classic picture theory\nof language (Wittgenstein\n 1921).\n",
