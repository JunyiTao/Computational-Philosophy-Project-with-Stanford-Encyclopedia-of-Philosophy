    "main_text": "Why informed consent? || Personal integrity\n2.7 Personal integrity\n\nA final rationale for informed consent requirements is the need to\nprotect patients\u2019 sense of personal integrity. One reason\noffered for keeping surrogate pregnancy contracts non-enforceable is\nthe need to maintain surrogate carriers\u2019 sense of personhood by\nnever coercively taking babies away (Radin 1983, e.g., 960). A similar\nrationale may be thought to justify informed consent in general, and\nto reflect our special relation to our bodies. As Gerald Dworkin put a\nslightly different point, \u201cone\u2019s body is irreplaceable and\ninescapable. If my architect doesn\u2019t listen to me and this\nresults in a house I do not like, I can always move. I cannot move\nfrom my body.\u201d (Dworkin 1988, 113). By one interpretation,\npersonal integrity underlies self-ownership norms. What it requires\nis, in Ronald Dworkin\u2019s words, \u201ca prophylactic line that\ncomes close to making the body inviolate\u201d (Dworkin 1983, 39).\nHowever, personal integrity may instead give rise to a normative\ncontinuum, on which the outer line of the body is only one stop.\nTouching someone\u2019s cheek without his informed consent is hardly\nas bad as touching more sensitive areas of his body without his\ninformed consent. The continuum may also extend outside the body. As\nJudith Thomson points out, it is a greater transgression to touch an\nunwilling person\u2019s body than to touch his shoes, yet a small\ntransgression exists, even when he is not wearing them (Thomson 1990,\n207\u20138). It also matters how and why these areas are touched.\nSuch continua may be thought to track the typical degree of injury to\npersonal integrity.\n\nAn account in terms of personal integrity would require more\nspecification. For example, what is the relation between this account\nand the offense of battery? Would this account condemn the use of a\nmagic wand to treat an unwilling patient\u2019s ailments without\ncutting his skin and so, perhaps without battery (Brock 1999, 529f)?\nWould it also condemn threat of fines that coerces patients to move\ntheir bodies in certain ways, even without touching them? Is the\naccount ultimately grounded in an a priori argument, in\nevolutionary psychology (Wertheimer 2003, 113f.), in the typical\nmaterial harms from violations of bodily integrity, or in still other\nconsiderations?\n",
