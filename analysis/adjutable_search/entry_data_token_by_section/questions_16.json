Formal semantic\ntheories of wh-complements can be organized around answers to this\nquestion.\n\nOne option (Groenendijk and Stokhof 1982) is to take a wh-complement\nto denote a proposition, just like a that-complement. A second option\n(Karttunen 1977) is to take wh-complements to denote sets of\npropositions. In either case, John\u2019s knowing who walks consists\nin the obtaining of a relation between John and the denotation of the\nexpression \u2018who walks\u2019. On the view that wh-complements\ndenote single propositions, wh-complements and that-complements are\ntreated uniformly, and Groenendijk and Stokhof (1982) contend that\nthis uniform treatment is a virtue of their theory. Lewis (1982)\nfavors the same sort of account, but he applies it only to\nwhether-complements. Theiler et al. (2018) propose a uniform\nanalysis of that- and wh-complements in the inquisitive semantics\nframework, overcoming certain limitations of Groenendijk and Stokhof\u2019s\npartition semantics.\n\nKarttunen, a proponent of the second option, takes wh-complements to\ndenote sets of true propositions, so that \u2018what John\nreads\u2019 denotes (Karttunen 1977, 20) \u201ca set which contains,\nfor each thing that John reads, the proposition that he reads\nit.\u201d On Groenendijk and Stokhof\u2019s account, by contrast,\n\u2018what John reads\u2019 denotes the proposition that is true in\na possible world if and only if the set of things that John reads in\nthat world equals the set of things John in fact reads. That is,\n\u2018what John reads\u2019 denotes a proposition that entails for\neach thing John reads that he reads it and for each thing John does\nnot read that he does not read it. Thus if one knows what John reads,\nit follows on Groenendijk and Stokhof\u2019s account (but not on\nKarttunen\u2019s) that one knows what John does not read. Also, on\nGroenendijk and Stokhof\u2019s account, the difference between\nknowing-that and knowing-wh amounts to a difference in what we might\ncall the rigidity of the complement. Consider the claim that\nI know that John reads Moby Dick and the claim that I know\nwhat John reads. The term \u2018that John reads Moby Dick\n\u2019 refers to the same proposition at every possible world; the\nterm \u2018what John reads\u2019 refers to different propositions at\nworlds at which John reads different things (and refers to the\nproposition that John reads Moby Dick at those worlds at\nwhich Moby Dick is the one and only thing that John reads).\n\n",
