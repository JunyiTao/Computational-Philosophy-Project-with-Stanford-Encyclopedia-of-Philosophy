    "main_text": "What is Harm? || A Setback to Interests\n5.2 A Setback to Interests\n\nAnother understanding of \u201charm\u201d again takes its cue from\nMill, this time from his many references to the\n\u201cinterests\u201d of persons\u2014for example: \u201cinsofar\nas these concern the interests of no person but himself\u201d and\n\u201csuch actions as are prejudicial to the interests of\nothers\u201d (Mill On Liberty, ch. 5, para 2). The important\ndistinction is not that which regards others versus that\nwhich regards oneself. It is that which is in the interests\nof others versus that which is in the interests of oneself. The\nseminal essay for this reading is from 1960 by John Rees (Rees 1960;\ncf. Saunders 2016), though Hart appears not to have been aware of it.\nRees paved the way for Feinberg\u2019s development of harm as\n\u201cthe setback of interests\u201d. Hence, in addition to\nFeinberg\u2019s addition of wrongfulness commented on above,\nFeinberg\u2019s defines harm as \u201cthose states of set-back\ninterest that are the consequence of wrongful acts or omissions by\nothers\u201d (Feinberg 1984: 215).\n\nThis Mill-inspired move of Rees and Feinberg, of defining harm in\nterms of interests, smacks of defining one unclear concept in terms of\nanother unclear concept (Miller 2010: 119). The question of what is in\na person\u2019s interests\u2014what is at stake for her\u2014is\nitself a question that requires considerable elucidation. In Derek\nParfit\u2019s terms should we understand \u201cinterests\u201d in\n\u201cdesire-fulfilment\u201d terms, in \u201chedonistic\u201d\nterms, or in accordance with an \u201cobjective list\u201d which\nholds\n\n\ncertain things are good or bad for people, whether or not the people\nwould want to have the good things, or to avoid the bad things?\n(Parfit 1984: 499)\n\n\nMight one reasonably think that adjudicating the conflict between\nhedonistic, desire-fulfilment and objective list understandings of\ninterests is an undertaking no less complex than the harm\nprinciple/legal moralism conflict itself? Take an \u201cobjective\nlist\u201d understanding of a person\u2019s interests. According to\nParfit this might include\u2014as good for a\nperson\u2014\u201cmoral goodness, rational activity, the development\nof one\u2019s abilities\u201d and so on; and it might\ninclude\u2014as bad for a person\u2014being \u201cdeprived of\ndignity\u201d (Parfit 1984: 499). If this is always or sometimes the\nbest account of interests, the whole question of \u201cmoral\nharm\u201d that the harm principle aims to expel is potentially\nreintroduced. The question of which account, or combination of\naccounts, is the most compelling is very much a live issue (Fletcher\n2016).\n",
