    "main_text": "Fine-Tuning and Design || Life-Friendly Conditions as Old Evidence\n3.3 Life-Friendly Conditions as Old Evidence\n\nViews according to which life-friendly conditions are improbable in an\nepistemic sense due to the required fine-tuning are challenged to come\nto terms with the fact that, as a matter of fact, we have long known\nthat our universe is life-friendly, which means that life-friendly\nconditions are not literally unexpected for us. As a\nconsequence of this fact, the Bayesian version of the argument from\nfine-tuning for a designer as outlined in\n Section 3.1\n must adopt some solution to Bayesianism\u2019s notorious problem\nof old evidence (Glymour 1980) because \\(R\\)\u2014that the\nconstants are right for life\u2014is inevitably old evidence\nfor us.\n\nAn obvious choice, endorsed by Monton (2006), who is critical of the\nargument from fine-tuning for design, and Collins (2009), who supports\nit, is the so-called counterfactual or ur-probability\nsolution to the problem of old evidence, as defended by Howson (1991).\nThe main advantage of this solution as applied to the argument from\nfine-tuning for design is that it allows to essentially preserve the\nargument, including \\(\\eqref{simpledes}\\) and \\(\\eqref{likelihoods}\\),\nwith the sole refinement that one must consistently construe all prior\nprobabilities \\(P(\\cdot)\\), conditional and unconditional, as\n\u201cur-probabilities\u201d, i.e., rational credences of some\ncounterfactual epistemic agent who is unaware that the constants are\nright for life. Somewhat bizarrely, as Monton points out (2006: 416),\nsuch an agent would have to be at least temporarily unaware of her/his\nexistence (or at least her/his existence as a form of life) because\notherwise she/he could not possibly be unaware that the conditions are\nright for life. Tentative suggestions concerning the background\nknowledge that can reasonably be ascribed to such an agent are\ndeveloped by Monton (2006: sect. 4) and Collins (2009: sect. 4.3).\n\nAn advantage of approaching the argument from fine-tuning for design\nusing the ur-probability solution is that it offers proponents of the\nargument a clear-cut rejection of the anthropic objection: as in\nKotzen\u2019s (2012) approach, the fact that we exist is treated not\nas background knowledge but as evidence taken into account by Bayesian\nconditioning. The appropriate comparison between likelihoods to\nconsider is thus not Sober\u2019s \\(\\eqref{ose}\\)\u2014at least not\nunder Sober\u2019s own interpretation of \u201cOSE\u201d\nas including \u201cWe exist\u201d\u2014but rather\n\\(\\eqref{likelihoods}\\) or \\(\\eqref{ose_kotzen}\\), both of which evade\nthe anthropic objection.\n",
