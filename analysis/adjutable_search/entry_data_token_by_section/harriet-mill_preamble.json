    "main_text": "\n\nWere I but capable of interpreting to the world one half the great\nthoughts and noble feelings which are buried in her grave, I should be\nthe medium of a greater benefit to it, than is ever likely to arise\nfrom anything that I can write, unprompted and unassisted by her all\nbut unrivaled wisdom. \u2014J. S. Mill\n([OL], 216)\n\n\nHarriet Taylor Mill (1807\u20131858) poses a unique set of problems\nfor an encyclopedist. The usual approach to writing an entry on a\nhistorical figure, namely presenting a straightforward summary of\ntheir major works and then offering a few words of appraisal, is not\navailable. This is because she worked in such close collaboration with\nJohn Stuart Mill that it is exceedingly difficult to disentangle their\ncontributions to the products of their joint effort. In attempting to\nassess Taylor Mill\u2019s philosophical career, one encounters\nsharply conflicting reports about her ability from people who knew\nher, contradictory evidence about her role in authoring several books\nand essays, and widely varying judgments about how much influence she\nexerted on Mill\u2019s thought and work.\n",
