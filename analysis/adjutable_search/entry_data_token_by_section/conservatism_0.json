    "main_text": "The Nature of Conservatism || Broad versus narrow sense conservatism\n1.1 Broad versus narrow sense conservatism\n\nConservatism in a broad sense, as a social attitude, has always\nexisted. It expresses the instinctive human fear of sudden change, and\ntendency to habitual action. Cecil, for instance, contrasts\n\u201cmodern Conservatism\u201d with the \u201cnatural\nconservatism\u201d from which it arises and depends on, found\n\u201cin almost every human mind\u201d (Cecil, 1912: 8). The\narch-royalist and anti-populist Earl of Clarendon, writing the history\nof the 17th century English Civil War soon after it\nhappened, was instinctively conservative in this broader,\nun-self-conscious sense. Thus Beiser contrasts the \u201cconservatism\n[that] had always existed in Germany as a social attitude\u201d, with\na self-conscious conservatism that developed as a social force in the\n1790s, opposed to the Aufkl\u00e4rung or Enlightenment, and\nin reaction to the French Revolution (Beiser 1992: 281).\n\u201cSelf-conscious\u201d here means not merely implicit in\nbehaviour, but consciously avowed, and ascribed to others. The most\ndistinctive and historically important version of this narrower,\nself-conscious conservatism rests on scepticism concerning reason in\npolitics.\n\nVarious precursors of this self-conscious conservatism have been\nclaimed. Aristotle is often cited, for holding that morality and\npolitics\u2014unlike natural science\u2014lack special experts, and\nthat in these areas, human experience over generations is the main\nsource of knowledge. Confucius is another possible precursor. His\nconcern with the breakdown of contemporary political institutions led\nto a cautious, conservative political outlook; his stress on authority\nand hierarchy prefigures central conservative themes. From a later but\nstill pre-Enlightenment era, the English common law notion of\nprecedent, developed by such as Edward Coke (1552\u20131634), is a\nclear influence on self-conscious conservatism (Pocock 1989). For\nHoppit,\n\n\nTory, or what would now be called \u2018conservative\u2019,\npolitical thought remained alive and well [in England] in the 1690s\nand 1700s\u2026.Thomas Sherlock [wrote] in 1704, \u2018To maintain\nthe Establish\u2019d Form of Government, is the First and Highest\nDuty of Men Acting in Society\u2019. (Hoppit 2000: 196)\n\n\nDavid Hume (1711\u20131776) is sometimes regarded as a conservative.\nHe was a sceptic about reasoning concerning ends as opposed to means,\nbut did not live to see the French Revolution and the arguments\nunderlying it; Dr. Johnson, a true Tory, remarked that he was \u201ca\nTory by chance\u201d (reported by Boswell, in Fieser ed. 2005:\n290).\n\nThe preceding thinkers are proto-conservatives; it is commonly\naccepted that as a self-conscious standpoint, conservatism came into\nexistence with or after Burke\u2019s critique of the French\nRevolution (Kirk 1954: 5; Honderich 2005: 6; Nisbet 1986; Claeys 2007:\n11\u201334). The 18th century European Enlightenment aimed\nto improve the human condition through reform of political\ninstitutions. Its thinkers aimed to establish ethical and political\nprinciples that appealed to reason rather than established authority\nor tradition, a \u201cuniversal ethics independent of historically\ncontingent tradition\u201d (Beveridge and Turnbull 1997: 124). The\nFrench Revolution gave powerful expression to this belief, rapidly\nreinforced by the Industrial Revolution and growth of capitalism. The\ndevelopment of capitalism, followed and revolutionised by\nindustrialisation, led to a process of cultural globalisation (see\nBayly 2004: Part I). Everyday experience, conditioned by the diffusion\nof commodities and ideas, reflected an increasing global\nstandardisation of cultural expression. In the 19th century, the\ndevelopment of communications by the invention of the telegraph, and\nthe growth of news media, popular culture and international travel,\nled to increasing cultural homogeneity and the appearance of more\ncosmopolitan ethical outlooks.\n\nAs far as the evolution of conservatism is concerned, the French\nRevolution was key. For many contemporary writers, that Revolution was\na liberation of the human spirit, an assertion of reason against\nirrational feudal authority. The Revolution reflected an Enlightenment\nattitude towards history, which it regarded not as the inevitable\nrealisation of a divine plan, but as open to direction by enlightened\nreason, expressed in social and educational reform. Although\nconservative thinkers opposed the French Revolution, their attitude\ntowards the Enlightenment is debated. Burke, as we will see the\nleading conservative thinker, is often associated with what Isaiah\nBerlin called the \u201cCounter-Enlightenment\u201d, but he has also\nbeen seen as \u201can Enlightened figure, who saw himself defending\nEnlightened Europe against the gens de lettres and their\nrevolutionary successors\u201d\u2014it was \u201cone Enlightenment\nin conflict with another\u201d (Pocock 1999: 7); \u201cBurke was a\nlifelong student of the Enlightenment who saw in the French Revolution\nthe ultimate threat to\u2026modern, rational, libertarian,\nenlightened Whig values\u201d (Clark 2001: 108). Bourke comments that\nhistorians have\n\n\nmistaken Burke\u2019s enlightened opposition to doctrinaire attacks\non organised religion for a\u2026counter-enlightenment\ncrusade\u2026 encouraged by a secular teleology [that reduces]\nenlightenment to the criticism of religion\u2026Burke\u2019s\nespousal of sceptical Whiggism and Protestant toleration is curiously\nreinterpreted as hostile to the very principles of enlightenment he\nwas in fact defending. (Bourke 2014: 28) \n\n\nThus the common assumption that conservatism rejects modernity is\nquestioned by Scruton, for whom it \u201cis itself a\nmodernism\u2026 [that desires] to live fully in the present, to\nunderstand it in all its imperfections\u201d (2007: 194). John Gray\ncomments that Oakeshott\u2019s conservative thought is paradoxical in\nthat he \u201cis in no sense an anti-modernist: If anything, he is an\nuncompromising modernist, perhaps even a postmodernist\u201d (Gray\n2007, Other Internet Resources).\n\nIt is important to recognise that the precise appearance of\nconservatism after 1789 is disputed. For some writers argue, the\nideology of conservatism was not articulated until the 1880s and 90s;\nonly then was Burke established as conservatism\u2019s \u2018master\nintellectual\u2019 (Jones 2017). Jones cites MacCunn\u2019s The\nPolitical Philosophy of Burke (1913), which converted the Whig\nstatesman into the originator of a political philosophy of\nconservatism. Cecil\u2019s Conservatism (1912) firmly established\nthe connection, devoting a chapter to Burke as the founder of\nconservatism. In contrast, Clark places the appropriation earlier,\narguing that \u201cThat new creation of the 1830s,\n\u2018conservatism\u2019, adopted Burke as its patron\nsaint\u2026If it was difficult after 1832 to build any systematic\npolitical theory around the historical Burke\u2019s principles, the social\nand political order having changed out of recognition, a Burkean style\nnevertheless passed into English discourse\u201d (Clark, 2001:\n109-10).\n",
