    "main_text": "\n The term \u201cNeoplatonism\u201d refers to a philosophical\nschool of thought that first emerged and flourished in the Greco-Roman\nworld of late antiquity, roughly from the time of the Roman Imperial\nCrisis to the Arab conquest, i.e., the middle of the 3rd to\nthe middle of the 7th century. In consequence of the demise\nof ancient materialist or corporealist thought such as Epicureanism\nand Stoicism, Neoplatonism became the dominant philosophical ideology\nof the period, offering a comprehensive understanding of the universe\nand the individual human being\u2019s place in it. However, in\ncontrast to labels such as \u201cStoic\u201d,\n\u201cPeripatetic\u201d or \u201cPlatonic\u201d, the designation\n\u201cNeoplatonic\u201d is of modern coinage and to some extent a\nmisnomer. Late antique philosophers now counted among \u201cthe\nNeoplatonists\u201d did not think of themselves as engaged in some\nsort of effort specifically to revive the spirit and the letter of\nPlato\u2019s dialogues. To be sure, they did call themselves\n\u201cPlatonists\u201d and held Plato\u2019s views, which they\nunderstood as a positive system of philosophical doctrine, in higher\nesteem than the tenets of the pre-Socratics, Aristotle, or any other\nsubsequent thinker. However, and more importantly, their signature\nproject is more accurately described as a grand synthesis of an\nintellectual heritage that was by then exceedingly rich and\nprofound. In effect, they absorbed, appropriated, and creatively\nharmonized almost the entire Hellenic tradition of philosophy,\nreligion, and even literature\u2014with the exceptions of\nEpicureanism, which they roundly rejected, and the thoroughgoing\ncorporealism of the Stoics. The result of this effort was a grandiose\nand powerfully persuasive system of thought that reflected upon a\nmillennium of intellectual culture and brought the scientific and\nmoral theories of Plato, Aristotle, and the ethics of the Stoics into\nfruitful dialogue with literature, myth, and religious practice. In\nvirtue of their inherent respect for the writings of many of their\npredecessors, the Neoplatonists together offered a kind of\nmeta-discourse and reflection on the sum-total of ideas produced over\ncenturies of sustained inquiry into the human condition.\nAs a natural consequence of their insistence on the undiminished\nrelevance of the past, the Neoplatonists developed their\ncharacteristically speculative brand of philosophical enquiry in which\nempirical facts tended to serve as illustrations rather than heuristic\nstarting points or test cases. Today, the Neoplatonic system may\nstrike one as lofty, counterintuitive, and implausible, but to dismiss\nit out of hand is difficult, especially if one is prepared to take\nseriously a few fundamental assumptions that are at least not\nobviously wrong and may possibly be right.\nThe most fundamental of these assumptions, which the Neoplatonists\nshared with the majority of intellectuals of the ancient world,\nincluding most pre-Socratic thinkers as well as Socrates, Plato,\nAristotle and their followers, is that mindful consciousness\n(nous, often translated as thought, intelligence, or\nintellect) is in an important sense ontologically prior to the\nphysical realm typically taken for ultimate reality (Mind over\nMatter). There existed a dispute between Plato and Aristotle over\nwhether or not the objects of mindful consciousness (abstract\nconcepts, Platonic or otherwise, numbers, geometrical properties, and\nso forth) are also ontologically prior, but the Neoplatonists regarded\nthis fact as a matter of inconsequential detail. And so, following a\nvenerable and abiding tradition of Mind over Matter, Neoplatonism\ninevitably turned out to be an idealist type of philosophy.\nThe second assumption, which the Neoplatonists shared with the\nStoics and the Hermetists (an influential group of Egyptian religious\nthinkers that predate the rise of Neoplatonism), was that reality, in\nall its cognitive and physical manifestations, depended on a highest\nprinciple which is unitary and singular. Neoplatonic philosophy is a\nstrict form of principle-monism that strives to understand everything\non the basis of a single cause that they considered divine, and\nindiscriminately referred to as \u201cthe First\u201d, \u201cthe\nOne\u201d, or \u201cthe Good\u201d. Since it is reasonable to\nassume, as the Neoplatonists did, that any efficient cause is\nontologically prior to, and hence more real, than its effect, then, in\nthe hierarchy of being, the first principle, whatever it is, cannot be\nless \u201creal\u201d than the phenomena it is supposed to explain.\nGiven the veracity of the first assumption (the ontological priority\nof intelligence and consciousness), it follows at once that the first\nprinciple must be a principle of consciousness. In consequence, the\nfundamental challenge all Neoplatonists struggled to meet was\nessentially the following: How are we to understand and describe the\nemergence of the universe, with all its diverse phenomena, as the\neffect of a singular principle of consciousness? In\nparticular\u2014and in this regard Neoplatonism shares certain\nconcerns with modern cosmology\u2014how is it possible to understand\nthe emergence of the physical, material universe from a singularity\nthat is in every sense unlike this universe? Their answer to this\nquestion was entirely new, and went far beyond any prior cosmic\naetiology, including that of Plato\u2019s Timaeus, in\nelegance and sophistication.\n",
