Our ability to\nthink about so-called external things, and steadily improve our\nunderstanding of them, rests upon our experience. Yet most pragmatists\nadopted accounts of experience and perception radically different from\nthe views of modern empiricists from John Locke and David Hume to\nRudolf Carnap, as well as the \u2018intuition\u2019 posited by Kant.\nThe established view interpreted experience as what is sometimes\n(following C.I. Lewis and Wilfrid Sellars) called \u2018the\ngiven\u2019: we are passive recipients of determinate and singular\n\u2018sense-data\u2019. Experience provides raw material for\nknowledge, but does not itself have content informed by concepts,\npractical needs, or anything else non-sensory. Our only contact with\nthe external world is through receiving such experiences. So this way\nof thinking about experience can easily lead to skepticism about the\nso-called \u2018external world\u2019.\n\nIn different ways, Peirce, James, and Dewey all argued that experience\nis far richer than this, and that earlier philosophers were mistaken\nto claim that we could identify \u2018experiences\u2019 or\n\u2018sense-data\u2019 as antecedents to, or separable constituents\nof, cognition. We can begin with James\u2019 radical\nempiricism, of which he said that \u2018the establishment of the\npragmatist theory of truth [was] a step of first-rate importance in\nmaking [it] prevail\u2019 (1909: 6f). The connection with pragmatism\nis evident from the fundamental \u2018postulate\u2019 of radical\nempiricism: \u2018the only things that shall be debatable among\nphilosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn from\nexperience\u2019. But this requires that experience be newly\nunderstood. First, he announced that \u2018the relations between\nthings, conjunctive as well as disjunctive, are just as much matters\nof direct particular experience, neither more so nor less so, than the\nthings themselves.\u2019 And, second, he concludes that \u2018the\nparts of experience hold together from next to next by relations that\nare themselves parts of experience. The directly apprehended universe\nneeds, in short, no extraneous trans-empirical connective support, but\npossesses in its own right a concatenated or continuous\nstructure.\u2019\n\nPeirce too emphasizes the continuous character of perceptual\nexperience, and adds that we directly perceive external things as\nexternal, as \u2018other\u2019, that we can perceive necessary\nconnections between events, and that experience contains elements of\ngenerality (citing a picture of a connected series of circles which\ncan be seen as a stone wall, in the manner of\nWittgenstein\u2019s famous duck-rabbit dual diagram). Around\n1902\u20133, Peirce developed a complex and original theory of\nperception which combines a percept, which is entirely\nnon-cognitive, with a perceptual judgement, which is structured\npropositionally and lies in the space of reasons. In this way he seeks\nto capture how perception is both immediately felt and\ntruth-evaluable. In contrast to standard British Empiricist analyses\nof the relation between impressions and ideas, Peirce does not claim\nthat a perceptual judgment copies its percept. Rather, it\nindexes it, just as a weather-cock indicates the direction of\nthe wind. Although percept and perceptual judgment are intrinsically\ndissimilar, over time certain habits of association between the two\nare reinforced, leading them to (literally) grow in our minds and link\nwith other habits. This enables percepts and perceptual judgments to\nmutually inform one another, to the point where every perception is\nfallible and subject to reinterpretation in the light of future\nperceptions (Legg 2017). The end result is that, as Peirce puts it, in\nstark contrast to the accepted understanding of experience as\n\u2018given\u2019: \u2018[n]othing at all\u2026is absolutely\nconfrontitional\u2019, although, \u2018the confrontitional is\ncontinually flowing in upon us\u2019 (CP 7.653). \n\nDewey\u2019s account of experience, which is central to his entire\nphilosophy, contributes an additional twist. Like Peirce, he thought\nthat experience was \u2018full of inference\u2019, but he arguably\ntook the notion further from the mere contents of individual\nconsciousness than any previous pragmatist. For Dewey, experience is a\nprocess through which we transact with our surroundings and meet our\nneeds. He wrote:\n\nLike its congeners life and history, [experience] includes what\nmen do and suffer, what they strive for, love, believe and\nendure, and also how men act and are acted upon, the ways in\nwhich they do and suffer, desire and enjoy, see, believe, imagine, in\nshort, processes of experiencing (LW1:18).\n\n\nWhat we experience is shaped by our habits of expectation and there is\nno basis for extracting from this complex process the kind of\n\u2018thin given\u2019 beloved of sense datum theorists. We\nexperience all sorts of objects, events and processes, and just as\nexperience is inextricable from the \u2018external\u2019 world of\nthings, Nature (its co-ordinate concept: what is experienced)\nis inextricable from the \u2018internal\u2019 world of concepts.\n\nIn sharp contrast to Dewey, neopragmatism no longer takes experience\nas an explicit philosophical theme. Rorty began his pre-pragmatist\nphilosophical career as an eliminative materialist, and the view\nsurvives in Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, newly\nbolstered by Sellarsian concerns about the \u2018myth of the\ngiven\u2019. On this basis, Rorty declares that \u2018Dewey should\nhave dropped the term \u201cexperience\u201d rather than redefining\nit\u2026 He should have agreed with Peirce that a great gulf divides\nsensation and cognition, [and] decided that cognition was possible\nonly for language users\u2026\u2019 (Rorty 1998: 297). Similarly,\nBrandom focusses his attention exclusively on linguistic meaning\n(albeit in this case qua rationalist), and has famously ruled\nthat (as \u2018blasphemy\u2019 was to Oscar Wilde)\n\u2018experience\u2019 is \u2018not one of his words\u2019\n(Brandom 2011: 197). This neopragmatist neglect of one of classical\npragmatism\u2019s central concepts has become a major point of\ncontention on the part of many New Pragmatists (e.g. Koopman 2007;\nLevine 2010, 2012; Sachs 2015).\n",
