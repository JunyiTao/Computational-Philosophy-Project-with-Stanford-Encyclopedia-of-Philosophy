    "main_text": "Normative for what? || Logic as normative for public practices\n2.3 Logic as normative for public practices\n\nSo far the answers to the question \u201cWhat is logic normative\nfor?\u201d we considered had in common that the \u201cactivities\u201d in\nquestion\u2014reasoning and thinking\u2014are internal, mental\nprocesses of individual agents. But logic also seems to exert\nnormative force on the external manifestations of these\nprocesses\u2014for instance, it codifies the standards to which we\nhold ourselves in our practices of assertion, rational dialogue and\nthe like. While much of the literature on the normativity of logic\nfocuses on internal processes of individuals, some authors have\ninstead emphasized logic\u2019s role as a purveyor of public standards for normatively regulated practices.\n\nTake the practice of asserting. Assertion is often said to \u201caim\nat truth\u201d (or knowledge, Williamson 2000: Ch. 11) as well as\nbeing a \u201cmatter of putting forward propositions for others to\nuse as evidence in the furtherance of their epistemic projects\u201d\n(Milne 2009: 282). Since I take the asserted propositions to be true\nand since truths entail further truths, I am \u201ccommitted to\nstanding by\u201d the logical consequences of my assertions or else\nto retract them if I am unable to meet challenges to my assertion or\nits consequences. Similarly, if the set of propositions I assert is\ninconsistent at least one of my assertions must fall short of being\ntrue and the set as a whole cannot be regarded as part of my evidence.\nPlausibly, therefore, logic does have a normative role to play in\ngoverning the practice of assertion.\n\nPeter Milne takes an interest in assertion mainly in order to\n\u201cwork back\u201d from there to how logic constrains belief. He\nconcludes that logic exerts normative force at least on the stock of\nbeliefs that constitute the agent\u2019s evidence (Milne 2009: 286).\nOther authors explicitly prioritize the external dimension of\nreasoning, conceived of as a social, inter-personal phenomenon.\nAccording to them, it is reasoning in this external sense (as opposed\nto intra-personal processes of belief revision, etc.) that is the\nprimary locus of logical normativity (MacKenzie 1989). The norms\ngovern our rational interactions with our peers. For instance, they\nmight be thought to codify the permissions and obligations governing\ncertain kinds of dialogues. Viewed from this perspective,\nlogic\u2019s normative impact on the intra-personal activity of\nreasoning is merely derivative, arrived at through a process of\ninteriorization. A view along these lines has been advanced by\nCatarina Dutilh Novaes (2015). In a similar vein Sinan Dogramaci\n(2012, 2015) has proposed a view he calls \u201cepistemic\ncommunism\u201d. According to epistemic communism our use of\n\u201crational\u201d applied to certain deductive rules has a\nspecific functional role. Its role is to coordinate our epistemic\nrules with a view to maximizing the efficiency of our communal\nepistemic practices. On the basis of this view, he then elaborates an\nargument for the pessimistic conclusion that no general theory of\nrationality is to be had.\n\nWe will here follow the bulk of the literature in asking after the\nnormative role logic might play in reasoning understood as an\nintra-personal activity. Yet, much of the discussion to follow applies\nmutatis mutandis to the other approaches.\n",
