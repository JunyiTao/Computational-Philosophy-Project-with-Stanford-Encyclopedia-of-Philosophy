    "main_text": "Two Criteria of Theoreticity || Reference to Nonobservable Entities and Properties\n1.1 Reference to Nonobservable Entities and Properties\n\nAs just explained, a theoretical term may simply be understood as an\nexpression that refers to nonobservable entities or properties.\nTheoreticity, on this understanding, is the negation of observability.\nThis explanation of theoreticity thus rests on an antecedent\nunderstanding of observability. What makes an entity or property\nobservable? As Carnap (1966: ch. 23) has pointed out, a philosopher\nunderstands the notion of observability in a narrower sense than a\nphysicist. For a philosopher, a property is observable if it can be\n\u2018directly perceived by the senses\u2019. Hence, such properties\nas \u2018blue\u2019, \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018colder\nthan\u2019 are paradigmatic examples of observable properties in the\nphilosopher\u2019s understanding of observability. The physicist, by\ncontrast, would also count quantitative magnitudes that can be\nmeasured in a \u2018relatively simple, direct way\u2019 as\nobservable. Hence, the physicist views such quantities as temperature,\npressure and intensity of electric current as observable.\n\nThe notion of direct perception is spelled out by Carnap (1966: ch.\n23) by two conditions. Direct perception means, first, perception\nunaided by technical instruments and, second, that the perception is\nunaided by inferences. These two conditions are obviously not\nsatisfied for the measurement of quantities like temperature and\npressure. For the philosopher, only spatial positions of liquids and\npointers are observed when these quantities are measured. To an even\nhigher degree, we are unable to observe electrons, molecules,\ngravitational forces and genes on this narrow understanding of\nobservability. Hence, expressions referring to such entities qualify\nas theoretical.\n\nIn sum, a property or object is observable\u2014in the\nphilosopher\u2019s sense\u2014if it can be perceived directly, where\ndirectness of observation excludes the use of technical artifacts and\ninferences. Notably, Carnap (1936/37: 455; 1966: 226) admits that his\nexplanation of the distinction is not sufficiently precise to\ndetermine a sharp line between observational and theoretical terms. He\nrather views the theory-observation distinction as being introduced\ninto a \u2018continuum of degrees of observability\u2019 by choice.\nProminent criticisms of the theory-observation distinction will be\ndiscussed in\n Section 2.1.\n",
