Special Topics in the Study of Animal Consciousness\nWith the gradual loosening of behaviorist strictures in psychology\nand ethology, and independent advances in neuroscience, there has been\na considerable increase in the number of animal studies that have some\nbearing on animal consciousness.  Some of these studies focus on\nspecific kinds of experience, such as pain, while others focus on\ncognitive abilities such as self-awareness that seem to be strongly\ncorrelated with human consciousness. This section contains brief\nreviews of some of the main areas of investigation.  The aim is to\nprovide some quick entry points into the scientific literature. \n",
