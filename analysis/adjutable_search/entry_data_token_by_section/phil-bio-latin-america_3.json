Some General Characteristics of Philosophy of Biology in Latin America\n2.2 Second and Third Periods. Some General Characteristics of Philosophy of Biology in Latin America\n\nDuring the second period, from the mid-twentieth century to the\n1980s\u20131990s, the professionalization and institutionalization or\n\u201cnormalcy\u201d of philosophy and philosophy of science was\nachieved in Latin America. However, although there were many\nphilosophers of physics, logic, and mathematics, as well as\nphilosophers of science in general, there were very few professional\nphilosophers of biology. In this period, some philosophy of biology\nwas done by the first generation of Latin American professional\nphilosophers of science, as well as by some biologists or biomedical\nresearchers who undertook the philosophy of their disciplines.\n\nThis was the case of the Mexican physician and physiologist Arturo\nRosenblueth. Together with US mathematician Norbert Wiener and US\nelectronics engineer Julian Bigelow, Rosenblueth made an important\ncontribution to the discussion of teleology, advancing the cybernetic,\nor non-functional, analysis of teleology in terms of purpose\ncontrol through negative feedback, with hopes of\napplication to machines and living organisms (Rosenblueth, Wiener,\n& Bigelow 1943). Another example is Argentine paleontologist\nOsvaldo Reig with his discussion on the reality of biological species\n(Reig 1979).\n\nIn the third period, from the 1990s to the present day, although there\nstill are professionally active biologists engaged in philosophical\nreflection on biology, there is an increasing professionalization of\nphilosophy of biology and therefore of people engaged in it,\nregardless of whether their initial education was in philosophy or\nbiology. It is worth mentioning the early work of perhaps the first\nprofessional philosophers of biology in Latin America: Mexicans\nMargarita Ponce and Jorge Mart\u00ednez-Contreras. Ponce\u2019s\nwork centered on functional analysis and attributions and on teleology\nand teleological explanation in biology (Ponce 1987), while\nMart\u00ednez-Contreras focused on philosophical history of biology\n(Mart\u00ednez-Contreras 1985a,b, 1989, 1992).\n\nDespite some significant differences between countries, we can\nidentify a similarity regarding the impact that political and economic\nconditions have had on philosophy of biology, that is, on scholars and\ntheir institutions, in the region. Latin America has and continues to\nsuffer from political and institutional instability, with Mexico being\nperhaps stabler than the rest of the region. Most other Latin American\ncountries have been characterized by repeated military coups\nd\u2019\u00e9tat (Brazil in 1964, Argentina in 1955, 1966, and\n1976, and Chile, Uruguay, and Bolivia in 1973, to mention only some of\nthe most significant) and more or less authoritarian governments\nengaged in oppression and proscription, including physical\ndisappearance. This context has necessarily truncated individual,\ngroup, or institutional projects and promising lines of research.\n\nThe most difficult political conditions pushed some philosophers into\nexile in countries and universities both outside and within Latin\nAmerica. Although in a forced and unintended way, this situation\nincreased academic dialogue in the region. In addition, scientific\nfunding in Latin America comes from the public sector, and the region\nhas experienced recurrent economic crises. Political agendas and\npublic policies also heavily affect research funding and lead to\nvariable support for undergraduate and graduate education, whether at\nhome or abroad, and also impact research programs through diverse\nfunding sources, such as councils or research agencies and\nuniversities.\n\nIn many Latin American countries, financial support was relatively\nscarce until recent democratic governments began increasing investment\nin research in the 1980s. Education and research in sciences,\nhumanities, and technology became a state policy in the region,\nespecially for the governments of Brazil and Argentina as of the turn\nof the millennium. This contributed decisively to broadening the\ncritical mass of people trained in philosophy of science and biology\nwho could acquire relatively stable university positions and become\nresearchers with access to both classical and current bibliography.\nThey also enjoyed the possibility of continuous academic exchange\nthrough attendance of academic events around the world, thus improving\nresearch productivity.\n\nHowever, with extraordinary cutbacks in science and education since\n2016 in countries like Brazil and Argentina, Latin American is\ncurrently undergoing a concerning setback. Given the change of\ngovernment in 2019, however, Argentina is slowly recovering from these\nchallenges. Furthermore, the social, political, economic, and\nfinancial crisis triggered worldwide by the COVID-19 pandemic, which\nrevealed inequalities both between and within countries, has also had\nan effect, the consequences of which are still difficult to predict\nfor the region. In any case, we can state that philosophy of biology\nin Latin America has been and still is often carried out in spite of\npolitical and economic conditions, rather than thanks to them.\n\nNevertheless, it is possible today to distinguish at least two\ngenerations of professional philosophers of biology in Latin America,\nwith the usual relationships of professor and student or advisor and\nadvisee. We can even begin to glimpse the emergence of a younger third\ngeneration. Most professionals who philosophically reflect on biology\nin Latin America have written and published in either Spanish or\nPortuguese. This may be one reason why the visibility and influence of\nLatin American philosophy of biology, like Latin American philosophy\nin general, has been relatively low outside the region. However, there\nare an increasing number of texts written and published in other\nlanguages, principally English and to a lesser extent German and\nFrench.\n\nBut the \u201cinternationalization\u201d of Latin American academic\nproduction, essentially publishing in English, does not come without a\nprice, as Wolters (2014) argues for the case of European philosophy of\nscience. And while traditional geographical, ideological, or personal\nbarriers are gradually being overcome, Latin American philosophers\ntend to adopt the agendas and methods established by international\npublications and cite authors they publish. Furthermore, even those\nwho still write in Spanish tend to \u201cdialogue\u201d with\ninternationally established authors, even if that dialogue only flows\none way, more than with philosophers who publish in Spanish. English\nto Spanish translations of authoritative philosophers of science and\nbiology, with the subsequent accessibility of those texts for Latin\nAmericans, have also contributed to this trend.\n\nHowever, the creation of national or regional societies constitutes a\ngrowing effort to build genuine community. Some examples include the\nBrazilian Association of Philosophy and History of Biology ABFHiB\n(Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Filosofia e\nHist\u00f3ria da Biologia) and regional societies like the\nAssociation for Philosophy and History of Science of the Southern Cone\nAFHIC (Asociaci\u00f3n de Filosof\u00eda e Historia de la\nCiencia del Cono Sur) or the Ibero-American Association for\nPhilosophy of Biology AIFIBI (Asociaci\u00f3n Iberoamericana de\nFilosof\u00eda de la Biolog\u00eda). These are not simply\ngroups of philosophers of biology living in the same region; they also\nwork on related topics or have shared methodologies, influences, and\ninterests and associate in particular advisor-student and\ncolleague-colleague relationships. They also tend to publish in the\nsame journals or publishing houses and establish rigorous, critical,\nand fruitful dialogues on topics that constitute a common framework.\nIn this sense, we might also mention Ludus Vitalis: Revista de\nFilosof\u00eda de las Ciencias de la Vida (Ludus\nVitalis: Philosophy of Life Sciences Journal), one of the first\njournals specialized in philosophy. It has been published biannually\nsince 1999 by the Centro de Estudios Filos\u00f3ficos,\nPol\u00edticos y Sociales Vicente Lombardo Toledano (CEFPSVLT,\nCenter for Philosophical, Political, and Social Studies Vicente\nLombardo Toledano), a public Mexican institution that has played\nan important role in the professionalization, institutionalization,\nand consolidation of philosophy of biology, particularly of evolution,\nin Latin America.\n\nThere is also growing insertion of Latin American philosophers of\nbiology, and of the community as a whole, into central international\ncircles of philosophy of science in general and philosophy of biology\nin particular. This insertion is due in part to the fact that some\nmembers of the first generation of professional philosophers of\nbiology carried out doctoral studies in the United States, the United\nKingdom, France, Spain, or Germany, while the second generation carry\nout mainly postdoctoral studies in these countries. Another\ncontributing factor is the organization of international conferences\nof philosophy of biology in Latin America, such as the Meeting of the\nInternational Society for the History, Philosophy and Social\nStudies of Biology, ISHPSSB, hosted in Mexico in 1999 and Brazil\nin 2017. As occurred in other geographical regions, philosophers of\nbiology in Latin America initially concentrated more on the problem of\nevolution and related issues, such as the species problem. Although\nthese themes are still prevalent, other areas like genetics, ecology,\nand developmental biology or evolutionary developmental biology are\nnow being worked on, as well as on a social agenda that includes\nscience education. The scope of this entry allows only for an overview\nof the main topics in philosophy of biology and, within these, the\nmost significant contributions made in Latin America in recent\ndecades.\n\nSection 3\n explores analysis of the concept of race,\n Section 4\n the analysis of biological theories, and\n Section 5\n the different ways of connecting philosophy of biology with history\nof biology. While these topics constitute common themes that have been\nexplored and can be considered representative of the work that has\nbeen done throughout Latin America, they do not do justice to the rich\nvariety of work produced by a large and ever-increasing number of\nresearchers who make significant contributions to the development of\nphilosophy of biology in the region.\n",
