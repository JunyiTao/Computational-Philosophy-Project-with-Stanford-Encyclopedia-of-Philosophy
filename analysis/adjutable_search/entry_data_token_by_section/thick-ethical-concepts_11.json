The Delineation Question: How Do Thick and Thin Concepts Differ?\n\nA crucial feature of the intuitive characterization of thick terms and\nconcepts with which we began is that they differ from the thin with\nrespect to the non-evaluative information each encode. Even if cruel\nacts are bad, not all bad acts can be cruel; cruel acts must involve,\nand are distinguished from other bad acts by, non-evaluative qualities\nsuch as taking pleasure in causing others to suffer. The thickening\nagent in thick terms is non-evaluative description. This contrast with\nthe thin may be understood in two kinds of ways: as a difference in\nkind, or as a difference in degree. As we consider each option in\nturn, we\u2019ll see that the question of how thick and thin terms\nand concepts differ has no theory-neutral answer.\n",
