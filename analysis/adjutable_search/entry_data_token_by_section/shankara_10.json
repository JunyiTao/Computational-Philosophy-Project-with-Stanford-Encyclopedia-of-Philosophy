    "main_text": "Consciousness, Mind, and Personal Identity || Superimposition: The Fundamental Problem of Ignorance\n3.4 Superimposition: The Fundamental Problem of Ignorance\n\nThe reflection and limitation theories above point to a fundamental\nerror shared by all beings. If individuation is the apparent\ndelimitation of nondual consciousness, then assuming personal identity\nis real is actually an error, a manifestation of ignorance.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara explains that we falsely identify with\n\u201cI\u201d, construct the possessiveness of \u201cmine\u201d,\nand then cling to them. We mutually superimpose consciousness on to\nour mind-body, and the mind-body on to consciousness (i.e., I am the\nmind-body, and the mind-body is I). Superimposition is possible even\nthough consciousness is not an object because it is the content of\n\u201cI\u201d and always immediate in one\u2019s experience. We\nassume the mind intrinsically possesses consciousness, and that\nconsciousness is subject to the mind-body\u2019s limitations, like\none may mistake a scratch in the mirror as actually marring\none\u2019s face. Similarly, one may mistake a clear crystal as red\ndue to a red flower placed behind it. Like the crystal or mirror, the\nmind-body is a conditioning adjunct (up\u0101dhi) that\nprovides a locus of individuation. This error conceals one\u2019s\nfundamental nondual nature, the ground of superimposition, like\nmistaking a rope for a snake conceals its rope nature. (See\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s seminal discussion of superimposition in\nhis introduction to the BrS\u016b titled, the \u201cCommentary on\nSuperimposition\u201d [Adhy\u0101sabh\u0101\u1e63ya]).\n\nThe epistemic failure of mutual superimposition is caused by ignorance\n(avidy\u0101). \u015aa\u1e45kara identifies\navidy\u0101 as the root cause of all existential suffering.\nIt produces a baseline of fear and anxiety due to assuming one\u2019s\nself as a limited being subject to sorrow, sickness, and death. Based\non this error, individuals seek wholeness, happiness, and\nlimitlessness through known ends like material gains, social status,\nhedonic pleasures, or reaching heavenly worlds; however, such\nendeavors are perpetually bound to fail because results of finite\nactions are limited, transient, and dependent. They may provide\ntemporary reprieves or happy mental states, but do not provide the\nlimitless wholeness of liberation. Only the direct understanding of\none\u2019s self as nondual brahman negates the error of\nsuperimposition, and frees one from the beginningless karmic\ncycle of death, rebirth, and suffering. One\u2019s cluster of\nmistaken self-identities and the whole psychological scaffolding that\nperpetuates suffering collapses only by removing the kingpin of\nignorance. Then only nondual consciousness remains standing. Upon\nrecognizing this reality, the mind rests in its own intrinsic being\nwith absolute fullness, peacefulness, and tranquility.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s soteriological project is thus primarily\nepistemological with several positive psychological repercussions.\n\nSeveral questions about \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s position on\nignorance became contentious in post-\u015aa\u1e45kara Advaita: Is\nthe locus of ignorance in the individual or brahman? Is\nignorance simply misapprehension or does it have a two-fold power of\ncovering and projection? Does it hold both epistemological and\nontological powers? Is there a distinction of cosmic root ignorance\nand secondary individual ignorance? And what is its relationship with\nm\u0101y\u0101? Such questions have caused several\nintra-Advaita debates as well as philosophical critiques from rival\ntraditions such as R\u0101m\u0101nuja\u2019s\nVi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita Ved\u0101nta and\nM\u0101dhva\u2019s Dvaita Ved\u0101nta.
