    "main_text": "The Basic Dutch Book Argument for Probabilism || Can it be Rational to Violate the Probability Axioms?\n1.4 Can it be Rational to Violate the Probability Axioms?\n\nAs noted above, the sure loss guaranteed by the Dutch Book theorem\nneed not amount to an actual loss. Indeed a bookie could reverse the\ndirection of the bets that would guarantee a loss for an incoherent\nagent so as to guarantee her a win, or there could be some sort of\nother prize that might be awarded for being incoherent. An incoherent\nagent might not be confronted by a clever bookie who could, or would,\ntake advantage of her, perhaps because she can take effective measures\nto avoid such folk. Even if so confronted, the agent can always\nprevent a sure loss by simply refusing to bet. It won\u2019t do to\nrespond to such a possibility by insisting on the stronger assumption\nthat an agent will always take bets where the expected value of each\nis non-negative, because this simply gives the argument a false\npremise. In any case, it is clear that the trouble with being\nincoherent cannot be that it will lead to losses. Rather, the idea\nbehind the version of the argument in section 1.2 should be taken to\nbe that incoherence opens one up to sure losses, in a way that having\ncoherent beliefs does not (given an appropriate version of the\nConverse Dutch Book theorem), and that such potential vulnerability\ndemands adherence to the axioms.\n\nWe may question whether either the conclusion that one ought to\nsatisfy the axioms or that incoherence is irrational follows\nfrom simply being open to a sure loss. If the threat of such a loss is\nseen as unlikely, say, if the agent thinks she won\u2019t face a\nclever bookie, has confidence that her charms will prevent her from\nending up on the losing side of a Dutch Book, or just thinks she\nwon\u2019t take bets leading to a Dutch Book if they are offered,\nthen it is hard to see why the mere potential of a sure loss should\ndemand coherence. Another problem here is the special status accorded\nto sure losses. In fact the potential sure loss is symmetric with a\npossible sure gain. As H\u00e1jek emphasizes, there is a\ncorresponding \u201cCzech Book Argument\u201d, which parallels the\nDBA, with the conclusion that one ought to violate the probability\ncalculus (H\u00e1jek 2005, 2008a). Construed as above, the DBA\nappears to be canceled out by the \u201cCzech Book Argument\u201d,\nalthough H\u00e1jek shows that the potential canceling out can be\navoided by reformulating the DBA with the assumption that the agent\nshould accept bets that are either fair or favorable (H\u00e1jek\n2008a). Still, it is compatible with the Dutch Book theorem that an\nincoherent agent could end up on the side of a sure gain, and so\nincoherence cannot be condemned as irrational simply by citing the\npossibility of sure losses.\n\nAlthough the threat of a sure loss may be remote, and an agent could\nface a sure gain, there are some situations in which incoherence is\nmore closely tied to actual losses. Some versions of the DBA appeal to\nsuch scenarios as a preliminary to attempting to establish the general\nirrationality of being incoherent. One tactic has been to argue that\nincoherence is irrational in so-called forced betting situations, and\nthen that the prohibition against being incoherent in such situations\ncan be universalized (Jackson and Pargetter 1976). In a forced betting\nsituation the agent is required to post betting quotients, and then to\nplace bets with those quotients, where the stake and direction of the\nbets are dictated by an opponent. Assuming that the only source of\nvalue is the money (valued linearly) involved in the wagers, it is\nclaimed that it is irrational to be incoherent in such a situation.\nBut this doesn\u2019t follow if the irrationality is taken as arising\nfrom actual losses that would result. Even in a forced betting\nscenario, there may be reasons to suppose that incoherent betting\nquotients will not be taken advantage of, as may occur if making book\nwould require knowledge of some very complicated logical truth\n(Kennedy and Chihara 1979). Here too, the direction of the bets could\nbe chosen so that an incoherent agent will have a sure gain. This\nwould be an odd forced betting situation, but if the agent had reason\nto believe that this would occur, it could actually be advisable for\nher to post incoherent odds.\n\nOne might begin instead with a competitive betting situation, in which\nit is given that both sides attempt to maximize their gain. Here there\nis a closer connection between incoherence and loss, since the bookie\nwill be trying to maximize his profit, and so a sure gain for an\nincoherent agent could only be the result of a mistake. If it is\nassumed that the agent is also forced to bet and that the bookie will\nact optimally, the agent should post coherent odds, for otherwise she\nwill be subject to a bankrupting Dutch Book. Of course if the\ncompetitive situation is one in which the agent can refuse to bet,\nhaving incoherent betting quotients need not leave her open to an\nactual loss.\n\nEven in those forced betting situations and competitive betting\nsituations in which it is irrational to post incoherent betting\nquotients, it still need not be irrational to have incoherent degrees\nof belief (Kennedy and Chihara 1979; Adams and Rosenkrantz 1980). For\nexample, if the agent must post odds on what she knows to be either a\nlogical truth or a logical falsehood in a forced betting situation,\nshe may be better off with a betting quotient of either 1 or 0, rather\nthan some intermediate value, for she is susceptible to a Dutch Book\nin the latter event, but she could end up with the objectively correct\nvalue in the former case and thus would avoid a loss. But it seems\nthat she can have reasons for an intermediate level of confidence,\nmaking such an evaluation more rational, at least in the sense of\nreflecting her available evidence, than an extreme one. Alternatively\nthe agent may simply have no idea whatsoever about the logical status\nof what is in fact a logical truth upon which she must post odds, in\nwhich case a confidence of .5, or perhaps remaining entirely agnostic\nby not adopting any particular level of confidence, seems more\nreasonable than her being fully confident despite her ignorance.\n\nAt the least, such examples raise questions about the connection that\nthe DBA presupposes between partial beliefs and favorable/unfavorable\nbetting odds. In the case where an agent must give her betting\nquotient for what is in fact a logical truth, any value less than one\nleaves her vulnerable to a sure loss, possibly a bankrupting one, yet\nin such cases not all such credences are rationally on a par. The\nissue here seems to be more than simply one about how well the\nunderlying theory of action and belief works for extreme values, but\nalso about the relevant conception of rational belief. Rational\naction-guiding credences should generally reflect the agent\u2019s\nevidence, yet at least in the cases above, probabilism seems sometimes\nto require that they do not. One may question whether the appropriate\nor intended sense of \u2018rational\u2019 is invoked in these cases\nin which it seems right to say that rational beliefs can come apart\nfrom betting quotients, but such objections just highlight the lack of\nclarity in most presentations of the argument over what sort of\nrationality is supposed to be at stake. It has been said, for\ninstance, that it is ideal rationality that demands adherence to the\naxioms, but this notion too is unclear. What can be said though is\nthat there are cases in which degrees of belief do satisfy an\nimportant ideal of rationality but where they seem to come apart from\nbetting quotients, and this puts additional pressure on the premise\nthat agents should be willing to accept bets where their degrees of\nbelief match the betting quotient.\n\nNeither a forced nor a competitive betting situation per se guarantees\nthat incoherence will result in actual losses, and even in the special\ncases in which it would bring them about, it appears that having\nincoherent degrees of belief need not be irrational. Indeed, whereas\ndegrees of belief may generally be thought of as guides to action, and\nas well-modeled by betting quotients in many cases, forced and\ncompetitive betting situations in fact reinforce the point that they\nare not always straightforwardly linked. Thus, arguments for the claim\nthat incoherence is generally irrational that begin with the claim\nthat it is irrational in forced betting situations fail to get off the\nground, let alone show that it is irrational outside of such\nsituations, where the connection between incoherence and the\npossibility of losses is even more tenuous. Still, forced and\ncompetitive betting situations are helpful in identifying rational\nconstraints under idealized conditions, and can serve as useful models\nof action in some situations. Under highly circumscribed conditions,\nwhere the agent\u2019s goals are limited, they show that it is\nprudent to post coherent betting quotients. It is a bad feature of\nincoherent betting quotients, whether or not they correspond to such\ndegrees of belief, that in a forced betting situation they provide the\nopportunity for a clever bookie to inflict a sure loss, and guarantee\nit in competitive ones with a utility-maximizing opponent. But, the\nspecial conditions that make it rational to have coherent betting\nquotients, so as to avoid a sure loss, are not met in general. In some\ncircumstances, a small sure loss can be better than the chance of a\ngreater loss. Additionally, where there is something of value that is\nlinked to a wager besides the stake, it can also be rational to act so\nas to bring about a sure loss on a bet.\n\nAside from the reasons given above for the fact that it can be\nrational to leave oneself open to, or act so as to guarantee, a sure\nloss, situations in which the value of a bet is not fully represented\nby its monetary payoff conditions present challenges for versions of\nthe DBA that take the problem with incoherence as stemming from the\nthreat of losing money. An agent may not wish to risk losing money on\na large bet, due to additional bad consequences that would or might\nensue, or the agent may suffer anxiety over the prospect of loss. De\nFinetti and others insist on limiting the stakes in an effort to get\naround this problem, but Ramsey already observed that one might have a\n\u201creluctance to bother with trifles\u201d, which is to say that\nthere is a negative value to placing bets with little potential gain.\nPerhaps there is some range for which the stakes are neither too high\nnor too low, such that the monetary payoffs may be taken as at least a\nreasonable approximation of the value of the bets, but this further\nlimits the situations in which a sure loss may be inflicted.\n \n\nIt\nis\nstandardly assumed, as in the version of the DBA given in section\n1.2, that an agent will be willing to buy or sell a bet on \\(S\\) for which\nher credence matches the betting quotient.  But in practice,\nbuying a bet may have a different value for an agent than selling that\nbet, because there is typically a lag between the time that a bet is\nplaced and when it is settled, as Rowbottom (2007) points out.\n Selling a bet involves collecting a sum up front and potentially\npaying out latter, which often has greater value than paying the same\nprice up front and with the potential payoff obtained later.\n This asymmetry between the value of buying and selling bets also\nconstrains the situations in which a Dutch Book can be\nmade.\n\nAnother problem involving the value of bets arises in establishing the\nadditivity axiom, for even if each in a set of bets is acceptable, it\ndoes not follow that they would be jointly acceptable. Consider a\nperson with 4 dollars, who needs 2 dollars for bus fare. He might be\nwilling to take either one of two wagers that cost 2 dollars for a\nchance at winning enough money to buy a newspaper to read on the ride,\nbut be unwilling to risk all 4 dollars, and the possibility of having\nto walk home. One response here is to insist that the bets should be\npresented in terms of utilities rather than money, although this\nraises difficulties of its own, since these are not objective\ncommodities. Such an approach involves assuming either directly or\nindirectly that such utilities are additive, but even this is not\nenough. While it may plausibly be argued that given a set of credences\nand utilities, pragmatic rationality requires maximizing expected\nvalue with respect to those credences and utilities, so that an agent\nwith incoherent degrees of belief is committed to accepting bets\n(paying off in utility) that lead to a sure loss, the problem for the\nDBA remains that being so committed to a sure loss is still not\nnecessarily irrational. See (Maher 1993).\n\nIt is clear that the version of the DBA presented in section 1.2 is\nfar from cogent. There is a gap between the agent\u2019s degrees of\nbelief and the acceptance of bets that would produce a sure loss, and\nthe possibility of such a loss need not entail irrationality. One can\nspecify situations in which the connections are tighter, but this\nfails to establish the general claim of probabilism.\n",
