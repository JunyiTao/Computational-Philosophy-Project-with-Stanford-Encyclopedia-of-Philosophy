    "main_text": "\n\nThe 20th century opened with rediscoveries of Gregor\nMendel\u2019s studies on patterns of inheritance in peas and closed\nwith a research project in molecular biology that was heralded as the\ninitial and necessary step for attaining a complete understanding of\nthe hereditary nature of humankind. Both basic science and\ntechnological feat, the Human Genome Project (HGP) sought to map and\nsequence the haploid human genome\u2019s 22 autosomes and 2 sex\nchromosomes, bringing to biology a \u201cbig science\u201d model\npreviously confined to physics. Officially launched in October 1990,\nthe project\u2019s official date of completion was timed to coincide\nwith celebrations of the 50th anniversary of James D.\nWatson and Francis Crick\u2019s discovery of the double-helical\nstructure of DNA. On 12 April 2003, heads of government of the six\ncountries that contributed to the sequencing efforts (the U.S., the\nU.K., Japan, France, Germany, and China) issued a joint proclamation\nthat the \u201cessential sequence of three billion base pairs of DNA\nof the Human Genome, the molecular instruction book of human\nlife,\u201d had been achieved (Dept. of Trade 2003). HGP researchers\ncompared their feat to the Apollo moon landing and splitting the atom.\nThey foresaw the dawn of a new era, \u201cthe era of the\ngenome,\u201d in which the genome sequence would provide a\n\u201ctremendous foundation on which to build the science and\nmedicine of the 21st century\u201d (NHGRI 2003).\n\nThis article begins by providing a brief history of the Human Genome\nProject. An overview of various scientific developments that unfolded\nin the aftermath of the HGP follows; these developments came to be\nreferred to as \u201cpostgenomics\u201d to distinguish them from\nactivities labelled \u201cgenomics\u201d that are associated\nspecifically with the mapping and sequencing of the genomes of humans\nand other organisms. The article then discusses some of the conceptual\nand social and ethical issues that gained the attention of\nphilosophers during the project\u2019s planning stages and as it\nunfolded, and which remain salient today. Novel with the HGP was the\ndecision of its scientific leadership to set aside funds to study the\nproject\u2019s ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI). Today,\nfrom a vantage point more than two-and-a-half decades after that\ndecision was made, it is possible to reflect on the ELSI model and its\nrelevance for ongoing biomedical research in genetics and\ngenomics/postgenomics.\n",
