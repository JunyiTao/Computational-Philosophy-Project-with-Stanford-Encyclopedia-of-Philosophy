Consider the cafeteria example.\nThe reason we place the healthy foods at eye level is because there is\na tendency to choose what is at eye level over options that are not.\nThe thought is that nudgers can harness this tendency by putting\nhealthy foods at that level.\n\nSince the positioning of foods is not a rational ground for choosing\nnudgers use this non-rational tendency so that healthy foods are\nchosen. Note in this case we get both a lack of transparency and the\nharnessing of non-rational tendencies.\n\nSome argue that taking advantage of our non-rational tendencies, even\nfor good ends, is objectionable.\n\nConsider the opt-out nudge. It relies upon, and works in virtue of, the\nfact that we tend to go with the given even if there are better\noptions easily available. It is because we irrationally choose the\nworse option that we present the better option for the agent to choose\nirrationally.\n\nFraming effects: It is one of the most confirmed findings of empirical\ndecision theory that subjects decisions are affected by different ways\nof presenting information. For example, in deciding on whether to have\nan operation which can cure one\u2019s disease but has the\npossibility of causing death how one chooses is affected by whether\none is told (A) or (B):\n\n90% of patients who have the operation survive. (survival\nrate)\n10% of the patients who have the operation die.\n(mortality rate)\n\n\nThis is exactly the same information but those told\n (A)\n are more likely to choose the operation than those given\n (B).\n It is irrational to make the decision differently depending on how it\nis worded.\n\nThis harnessing of the irrational for our own good is not paradoxical\nbut it strikes some as problematic in the same way getting children to\nread by offering them financial incentives is problematic. We are\ngetting them to read for the wrong reasons. At least in these cases\nthere is the idea that once reading they will come to appreciate the\npleasures and importance of reading for its own sake. But do people\nwho stick with opt-in out of a tendency to stick with the given learn\nto change their faulty heuristic? If anything, it is reinforced\nbecause their faulty heuristic has a good consequence.\n\nIf we think of cases of rational persuasion, then in the ideal case,\nwe would find that the agent chooses because she believes she has been\ngiven reasons, these reasons support her choice, and she acts because\nof those reasons. In the case of harnessing non-rational tendencies\nfor nudges these conditions are not satisfied.\n\nIt is a good thing that, usually, we act not simply in accordance with\nthe reasons there are to act, but also out of, in recognition, of\nthose reasons. This desirable feature may be out-weighed if the goods\naccomplished by nudges are important, and alternative interventions\nare much less effective and/or require much costly or difficult to\noperate.\n\nIt is clear that while many nudges (as defined) harness bad reasoning,\nmost do not. Some do not harness reasoning at all, e.g., the\neyes/coffee case.\n",
