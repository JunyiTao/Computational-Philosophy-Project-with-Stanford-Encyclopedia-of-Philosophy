    "main_text": "The Debate About the Comprehensiveness of Liberalism || Liberal Ethics\n3.2 Liberal Ethics\n\nFollowing Wilhelm von Humboldt (1993 [1854]), in On Liberty\nMill argues that one basis for endorsing freedom (Mill\nbelieves there are many), is the goodness of developing individuality\nand cultivating capacities:\n\nIndividuality is the same thing with development, and\u2026it is\nonly the cultivation of individuality which produces, or can produce,\nwell-developed human beings\u2026what more can be said of any\ncondition of human affairs, than that it brings human beings\nthemselves nearer to the best thing they can be? or what worse can be\nsaid of any obstruction to good, than that it prevents this? (Mill,\n1963, vol. 18: 267)\n\n\nThis is not just a theory about politics: it is a substantive,\nperfectionist, moral theory about the good. On this view, the right\nthing to do is to promote development or perfection, but only a regime\nsecuring extensive liberty for each person can accomplish this (Wall,\n1998). This moral ideal of human perfection and development dominated\nliberal thinking in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and\nmuch of the twentieth: not only Mill, but T.H. Green, L.T. Hobhouse,\nBernard Bosanquet, John Dewey and even Rawls show allegiance to\nvariants of this perfectionist ethic and the claim that it provides a\nfoundation for endorsing a regime of liberal rights (Gaus, 1983a). And\nit is fundamental to the proponents of liberal autonomy discussed\nabove, as well as \u2018liberal virtue\u2019 theorists such as\nWilliam Galston (1980). That the good life is necessarily a freely\nchosen one in which a person develops his unique capacities as part of\na plan of life is probably the dominant liberal ethic of the past\ncentury.\n\nThe main challenge to Millian perfectionism\u2019s status as the\ndistinctly liberal ethic comes from moral\ncontractualism/contractarianism, which can be divided into what might\nvery roughly be labeled \u2018Kantian\u2019 and\n\u2018Hobbesian\u2019 versions. According to Kantian contractualism,\n\u201csociety, being composed of a plurality of persons, each with\nhis own aims, interests, and conceptions of the good, is best arranged\nwhen it is governed by principles that do not themselves\npresuppose any particular conception of the good\u2026\u201d\n(Sandel, 1982: 1). On this view, respect for the personhood of others\ndemands that we refrain from imposing our view of the good life on\nthem. Only principles that can be justified to all respect the\npersonhood of each. We thus witness the tendency of recent liberal\ntheory (Reiman, 1990; Scanlon, 1998) to transform the social contract\nfrom an account of the state to an overall justification of morality,\nor at least a social morality. This is not to deny, however, that\nliberalism is, after all, essentially a view that there is such a\nthing as minding one\u2019s own business, and that there is a sphere within\nwhich we have the right to say \u201cIt\u2019s my life\u201d while politely declining\ninvitations to justify ourselves. Liberalism is the idea that there\nare limits to any need for public justification.\n\nIn contrast, distinctively Hobbesian contractarianism supposes only\nthat individuals are self-interested and correctly perceive that each\nperson\u2019s ability to effectively pursue her interests is enhanced\nby a framework of norms that structure social life and divide the\nfruits of social cooperation (Gauthier, 1986; Hampton, 1986; Kavka,\n1986). Morality, then, is a common framework that advances the\nself-interest of each. The claim of Hobbesian contractarianism to be a\ndistinctly liberal conception of morality stems from the importance of\nindividual freedom and property in such a common framework: only\nsystems of norms that allow each person great freedom to pursue her\ninterests as she sees fit could, it is argued, be the object of\nconsensus among self-interested agents (Courtland, 2008; Gaus, 2012;\nRidge, 1998; Gauthier, 1995). The continuing problem for Hobbesian\ncontractarianism is the apparent rationality of free-riding: if\neveryone (or enough) complies with the terms of the contract, and so\nsocial order is achieved, it would seem rational to defect, and act\nimmorally when one can gain by doing so. This is essentially the\nargument of Hobbes\u2019s \u2018Foole\u2019, and from Hobbes (1948\n[1651]: 94ff) to Gauthier (1986: 160ff), Hobbesians have tried to\nreply to it.\n",
